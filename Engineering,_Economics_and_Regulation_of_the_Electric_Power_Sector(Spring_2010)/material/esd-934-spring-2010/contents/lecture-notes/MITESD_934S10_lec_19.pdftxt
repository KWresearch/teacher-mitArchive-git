The debate on security of electricity supply
•  Who is the ultimate responsible entity?
•  Should security of electricity supply be left to market 
forces?
•  The several perspectives to be considered
•  Electricity networks
•  Electricity generation
with different time scopes
•  security of power system operation
•  ﬁrmness of the installed capacity 
•  adequacy of existing & planned investment
•  strategic, energy policy

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 5 

The nature of the problem & the terminology (1)
Interlinked time perspectives:
• 
–  Reliability: security + ﬁrmness + adequacy
–  With a sound Strategic energy policy
•  Security: readiness of existing generation capacity to 
respond, when it is needed in operation, to meet the actual 
load (a short-term issue)
•  Security typically depends on the operating reserves that are 
prescribed by the ISO
•  Firmness: short-term generation availability that partly 
results from operation planning activities of the already 
installed capacity (a short to mid-term issue)
•  Firmness depends on short & medium term management of 
generator maintenance, fuel supply contracts, reservoir 
management, start-up schedules, etc. 
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 6 

The nature of the problem & the terminology (2)

•  Adequacy: existence of enough available capacity, both 
installed &/or expected, to meet demand (a long-term issue)
–  Is the market remuneration enough to promote the entry of 
generation technologies that are well adapted to the future 
evolution of the demand in the long term?
•  Strategic energy policy: concern for the long-term 
availability of energy resources: physical existence, price, 
energy dependence of the country, reliability of the internal 
& external energy resources, potential environmental 
constraints, etc. (a long to very long term issue)

The question: Can generation security, ﬁrmness, adequacy 
and strategic issues be left entirely to the market?

Basic issues in generation adequacy/ﬁrmness (i)
•  Who has the ultimate responsibility for the reliability of 
supply and generation adequacy in particular?
Is the market remuneration mechanism adequate for the 
groups with highest variable costs (peaking units)? 
Can system short-term marginal prices remunerate the 
total costs of plants?
–  Price caps
•  Insufﬁciency of revenues from the market 
–  Uncertainty / volatility of the market revenues
•  Risk aversion of potential generation investors
–  Passivity of demand
•  Small chance of contracting for these groups

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 9 

Basic issues in generation adequacy/ﬁrmness (ii)
Is the spot market price enough to encourage operation 
• 
strategies (maintenance scheduling, hydro management, 
fuel contracts) that provide acceptable ﬁrmness?
•  How to avoid that any additional economic signals to 
promote investment may interfere with the efﬁcient market 
operation?
•  Should consumers be allowed to choose their individual 
level of reliability of supply?
•  ¿How to complete the market so that it can internalize 
environmental costs of generation as well as the limitations 
in energy resources so that energy sustainability can be 
achieved? (overlap with “strategic issues”)

Identifying market failures (i)

• 

•  Who is responsible for generation adequacy?
In the traditional systems: the regulator / incumbent utility
• 
–  It might not be perfectly efﬁcient...
... but capacity was ﬁnally built 
In the liberalized systems: individual ﬁrms
–  They make decisions in order to maximize their 
own proﬁt
–  There is a strong theoretical basis showing that, 
under rational behavior, short-term marginal prices  
are enough to provide optimal decisions
No problem up to this point

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 14 

Identifying market failures (ii)
•  But some difﬁculties arise in actual markets:
–  Price caps
•  They also cap the incentives to build more capacity
–  Risk aversion
•  Firms do not always decide to take into consideration 
just the mean average value of the expected proﬁts
•  Volatile income proﬁles discourage investment
•  This is clearly the case of a peaking unit
–  It receives no income most of the time
–  It captures high prices when supply is tight
•  Thus, the spot market alone is not enough to 
provide an adequate capacity level
Now there is a problem

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 15 

Detail (i)

•  Basic economic theory
–  The  power plants recover their investment costs thanks to 
the inframarginal proﬁts 

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 16 

Detail (ii)

• 

In energy-only markets the peaking units recover their 
investment costs when the prices are set by the demand 
or … by using their market power during peak hours

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 17 

Detail (iii)

•  Two typical anomalous situations that lead to lack of 
investment
Regulated tariffs

Price caps

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 18 

Identifying market failures (iii)
•  The risk-averse generator...
... wants to be protected against low prices
... tends to build less capacity than a risk-neutral one
•  The risk-averse consumer...
... wants to be protected against very high prices
... would like to have in the system more capacity than a risk-neutral one
•  Long-term contracting among them would...
... reduce the risk of high prices for the consumer
... allow the consumer to pay for the capacity he wants
... diminish the risk of the generator
... make attractive the construction of the peaking facilities
•  A long-term market would naturally arise
–  It would ﬁx the adequacy problem if price caps are eliminated
Demand activity in the long-term market solves the problem
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 19 

Identifying market failures (iv)
•  Unfortunately, actual demand is not playing that role:
–  Regulated tariffs eliminate the need to protect against 
price spikes
–  Even the consumers that see spot prices often ignore 
reliability in their decisions
•  Some kind of implicit insurance is expected to be provided by 
the authorities and the market rules 
–  ʻThey will not allow blackouts to happenʼ
•  Thus, there is a lack of demand-side response in the 
long-term market
–  Consumers are not expressing their need for a good 
reliability, so it is not included in the price formation
–  This creates difﬁculties for reliability-oriented generation to 
get installed
Thus, there is a market failure

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 20 

Identifying market failures (v)
•  It is not enough to have good short-term demand 
elasticity
–  When a critical situation occurs, short-term demand 
elasticity would make self-rationing appear...
•  So the shortage problem would be alleviated
... but prices would still be high
•  And consumers would also complain
•  Short-term demand elasticity is generally an expensive 
way to provide adequacy
–  Due to risk aversion
–  And at some moment a peaking unit would be needed
•  Any good solution to the problem requires some 
measure to reduce risk for peaking generation
Thus, there is a market failure
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 21 

• 

Other issues
•  Regulatory instability
–  Flawed regulations signal that regulatory changes will 
happen
Imports & export commitments / ﬁrmness of contracts with 
external agents
•  Free-riding 
• 
In some countries the future uncertainties are really high
–  Inherent country risk premium
–  Demand increase rate is high and very volatile 
–  Meteorological phenomena like “Niña” and “Niño” stress the 
system in difﬁcult ways

•  Background
•  Basic issues in guarantee of supply
•  Identifying the market failure
•  Regulatory instruments

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 23 

Basic regulatory instruments

A.  No intervention (“leave it to the market”)
B.  System Operator purchases &/or manages peaking or other 
generators (“essential generators”)
C.  Regulated competitive bidding of new generation if expected 
margin is considered too low (“regulated auctions”)
D.  Additional remuneration (“capacity payment” or “short-term 
extra payment”) to promote some extra guarantee of supply
E.  Mandatory contract cover to be assigned by market 
mechanisms (“capacity obligations”)
F.  Auction of contracts on behalf of all demand (“reliability 
options”)

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 24 

A: Leave it to the market (i)
•  Motivations
–  It is simplest
–  Follows the basic principle of minimizing any interference with 
the market
•  Implementation
–  Do nothing (but, for the sake of consistency, also avoid price 
caps, let all consumers be exposed to spot prices, etc.)
•  Evaluation
–  It ignores the existence of market failures
•  risk aversion of investors
•  passivity of consumers
and it may lead to undesirable adequacy levels
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 25 

A: Leave it to the market (ii)

•  This appears to be the orthodox economic approach
–  It fully relies on market forces & learning of agents in the 
long-term
–  But it ignores the existence of market failures
•  System adequacy/ﬁrmness are not guaranteed
–  Blackouts and high prices may happen
–  Consumers that do not hold insurance contracts may be in 
trouble
–  Eventually they may learn the importance of long-term 
hedging

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 26 

A: Leave it to the market (iii)

• 

It may require a long learning process until it functions 
satisfactorily
–  Very painful
•  “The baby playing near the window”
–  Market rules might probably be drastically changed before 
the learning process is completed
•  It has been the case in California
•  Many experts consider it wise to have some kind of safety 
net or incentive to promote “enough” investment
–  At least as a transitory measure
•  Examples: California (initial design), Australia, Norway, UK 
(NETA)

Case examples

•  Australia
•  United Kingdom
•  Norway

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 28 

Australia: Energy-only market (i)

•  Australian National Energy Market (NEM)
–  Compulsory pool with energy-only market
•  Continuous trading
•  Zonal prices in the different regions
•  Prices calculated every ﬁve minutes
–  Half an hour prices
–  Financial hedges and ancillary services 
outside the market
–  Price cap: 6250 €/MWh
•  Full retail competition with default tariffs
•  Mixed supply structure: fully private 
(Victoria & SA) and mostly public (NSW & 
Queensland) generation companies

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 29 

Australia: Energy-only market (ii)

•  Price spikes are a normal occurrence
–  Possibility of abuse of market power
•  Market prices appear to signal new generation investment 
correctly (aligned with demand growth)
–  Substantial private investment in peak capacity (gas)
–  Perhaps scarce investment in base-load units (coal)
•  Only a few small customer interruptions
•  Prices in lower range in international comparisons
•  Still more time is needed to have a solid opinion, but so far 
it can be considered a success

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 30 

Australia: Energy-only market (iii)

•  Volatility

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 31 

NETA: Long-term reserves (i)

•  NETA, now BETTA 
–  Bilateral contracts + balancing (ʻpay as bidʼ)
•  95% of energy is traded bilaterally, only 5% through the 
balancing market
–  Introduction of “Standing Reserves”
–  Serious concern about lack of new investment (project 
Discovery)

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 32 

NETA: Long-term reserves (ii)
•  “Standing reserves”
–  Short-term reserves bought in advance (a year ahead)
–  Demand (28%) and generation (72%) offers
–  Volume depending on the season, day and hour and 
allocated via a competitive tender process
–  This energy is excluded from the energy market
•  Two types of contracts
–  Balancing mechanism participants
•  Balancing price + standing agreement for availability
–  Non-Balancing Mechanism participants
•  Both payments by standing reserve agreement
•  2004/2005 - 2200 MW (around 4% of peak load)
–  It could ask for more volume during the year (2005- 850 MW)
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 33 

Norway
•  Energy-only market
•  The market survived the crisis of the winter of 2003
–  Afterwards, a White Paper recommended to adopt some 
measures, mostly based on anticipated purchase of reserves
•  Presently there is a week-ahead (initially a year ahead) 
market of operating reserves so that there are energy & 
reserves left after the daily spot market
–  Reserve availability is paid according to the auction
–  Any used energy is paid the balancing market price

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 34 

B: Essential generators
•  Motivation
–  Guarantee a prescribed amount of installed & ready to use 
peak generation capacity
•  Implementation
–  The System Operator purchases & manages a prescribed 
amount of peak generation capacity
–  This peak generation participates in the market under special 
rules
•  Evaluation
–  Sufﬁcient peaking capacity is guaranteed
–  It may seriously interfere with the functioning of the market
–  Not only peak capacity may be lacking
–  Some aspects in common with the tendering procedure in the 
new EU Electricity Directive

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 35 

B: Essential generators (i)

B1: Peaking units bought by the SO
•  The System Operator (SO) purchases &/or contracts some 
prescribed amount of peaking units
–  These units may be unwilling to stay in the market under the 
do nothing scheme
–  But the SO considers that they will be needed for reliability 
purposes in the future
–  So the SO purchases & controls them to prevent their 
retirement
•  Examples: Sweden, Italy (it was considered for some time)

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 36 

B: Essential generators (ii)

B2: An alternative implementation (softer, it may not be 
considered an instrument to achieve adequacy)
•  The SO buys tertiary reserve in advance
–  E.g. one or several years before
–  This provides a volume of energy available to balance the 
system during shortages
•  Examples: Norway, FERC (ACAP, proposed)
–  The Netherlands has selected still another alternative 
scheme that tries to solve the detected problems

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 37 

B: Essential generators (iii)

• 

•  These implementations only provide revenues to a few 
generators...
... but they may reduce market prices for all
It is not desirable to have the SO bidding his own units / 
energy in the market
–  Confusion of roles
–  Market results would be greatly inﬂuenced by SO actions
•  The market is split into two parts:
–  The competitive one
–  The regulated peaking generators that operate outside the 
market

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 38 

C: Regulated auctions (i)

•  Whenever the regulator considers that new investments 
are not appearing at an adequate pace, he calls for an 
auction where long-term contracts (PPA-like) are assigned 
–  The auction may (or may not) include conditions on the 
desired type of technology, etc.
Included in the EU Electricity Directive & in the EU 
Directive for security of supply

• 

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 39 

C: Regulated auctions (ii)

•  This solution does guarantee that new generation would 
be installed if needed
•  But investors may tend not to invest in new plants unless 
they are awarded one of these PPAs
–  They would delay their free investment decisions until the 
regulator gets anxious and decides to call for an auction
•  This may interfere much with the normal functioning of the 
market

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 40 

Brazil: The initial model (i) 
•  Brazilian market started in 1996 with a wholesale market 
based on:
–  Centralized economic dispatch with the variable costs of the 
marginal generation units as prices 
–  Installed capacity about 85 GW (85% hydro)
–  Hourly average production 44 GW (95% hydro)
–  Peak demand 59 GW
–  Hydro unit of Itaipu (12.6 GW, 90 TWh, 24% Demand)
•  During nine months in 2001 and 2002 rationing was 
imposed to all classes of consumers due to a persistent 
drought
–  They were forced to reduce their demand by 20%
  Crisis & change of government: The conﬁdence on the 
market was severely damaged
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 41 

Brazil: The initial model (ii)
•  Distribution companies are mostly private but only 15% of 
the generation is private
•  Prices were extremely volatile Bad investment signal 

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 42 

Brazil: Long-term contracts auctions (i)
•  A two-step system based on mandatory bilateral contracts 
has been adopted as an incentive for new generation
–  All consumers were required to be covered by bilateral 
contracts (PPAs)
•  The percentage was set at 100% for distributors
–  In order to be registered, a bilateral contract must be 
“backed up” by “physical” production capacity on the part of 
the seller
•  Generatorsʼ ﬁrm capacity is administratively determined 
–  The new market design creates a system of open auctions  
with PPA contracts:
•  Auctions for existing energy
•  Auctions for new energy
–  Contracts for 15 years or more

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 43 

Brazil: Long-term contracts auctions (ii)

•  Auctions for new energy happen 5 and 3 years ahead of 
delivery (“A-5” and “A-3” auctions – one of each per year)
–  Pass-through rules induce efﬁcient contracting
•  Generators must contract with all distributors, in proportion 
to their energy needs
•  Sixty days before the auction, distributors inform energy 
amounts they want to contract
•  Ministry of Mines & Energy offers new projects for the 
auction (already with environmental authorization), which must 
provide twice the energy requirements of distributors
Investors may participate with their own projects

• 

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 44 

D: Capacity payments (i)
•  Motivation
–  Promote new investment and discourage retirement of 
capacity by an additional capacity-based payment
–  Stabilize volatile income of generators (reduce risk aversion) 
while reducing the market price level (extra capacity)
•  Implementation
–  Establish level of capacity payment (global or per unit)
–  Assign payments to individual generators broadly based on 
contribution to system reliability
•  Evaluation
–  Stable economic signal but risk of market interference
–  Lack of an identiﬁable commercial product
–  Difﬁculties in establishing level and assigning payments
–  No guarantee that the adequacy objective will be achieved

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 45 

• 

D: Capacity payments (ii)
It is a long-term payment 
–  Reduces the risk...
... but it does not provide proper incentives for short-term 
operation
–  A generator may get the payment and be unavailable when the 
system is short 
–  Detailed rules aimed to correct this issue have generally 
distorted the short-term dispatch of some groups and resulted 
very contentious
•  Both the total budget and its allocation among the 
generators use to be contentious
–  Hydro vs. thermal
–  The case of the junk generators

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 46 

South America & Spain: Capacity payments
•  Motivation
–  Promote new investment and discourage retirement of 
capacity by an additional capacity-based payment
–  Stabilize volatile income of generators (reduce risk aversion) 
while reducing the market price (extra capacity)

Capacity payment 

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 47 

South America & Spain: Capacity payments
•  Colombian experience (previous to introduction of reliability options)
–  Hydro production (70%-50%); Thermal (30%-50%) 
–  Capacity payment was about 50% of  the generatorsʼ income
–  Extremely volatile prices due to the “Niño” and “Niña” 
phenomena (frequency from 3 to 7 years )
•  From price zero to near rationing or directly rationing
•  Usual overestimation of the hydro units ﬁrm capacity
–  The problem of the junk generators
•  Solved by introducing economic criteria in the ﬁrm capacity 
determination
–  Availability was checked by random requirements to produce
•  This method introduces inefﬁciencies in the market
–  They have changed to a new design of the capacity 
mechanism in 2008

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 48 

South America & Spain: Capacity payments (v)
•  Peruvian experience
–  Hydro production (90%-70%), Thermal(10%-30%) 
–  Similar uncertain weather conditions as in Colombia
–  Market design based on the Chilean electricity market
•  Centralized economic dispatch according to audited costs
•  Most of the energy is traded by bilateral contracts (90%)
–  Demand increase around 5%-10% annual 
•  The existing generation has evolved to a polarized mix 
with base load units and expensive “fuel units” (more than 
200 €/MWh)
–  Market power and inframarginal beneﬁts
–  Introduction of economic criteria in the ﬁrm capacity 
determination 
–  The capacity payment has been useless to attract new 
investments, just to maintain junk generators
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 49 

South America & Spain: Capacity payments
Spanish experience:
•  About 10% of the ﬁnal price of the market income
•  The ﬁrm capacity is calculated administratively and the 
actual availability is not seriously veriﬁed
•  Difﬁcult to evaluate the effect of the method, but it has 
avoided mothballing old and expensive fuel units
–  Investment in new capacity seems to have other reasons 
than the incentive from capacity payments
–  After the stressful situation of the winter of 2002, the margin 
for the next ﬁve years appears to be wider, because of the 
investments in new CCGT & large growth of renewables

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 50 

Alternative D1: A short-term extra payment (i)

•  The basic idea is to provide an extra payment in the spot 
market to attract new entrants
–  Implemented as a reliability adder to the spot energy price
–  The shorter the capacity margin, the higher the extra 
remuneration should be
•  UK (before NETA)
–  Bizarre implementation: It was an energy-only mandatory 
pool with spot price computed ex ante
–  But the loss of load probability (LOLP) embedded in the 
computation of the spot price was grossly overvalued  
extra income

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 51 

Alternative D1: A short-term extra payment (ii)

•  The LOLP term seems easy to manipulate
–  As it has been in the UK

•  This extra payment may attract some generators...
... but it is very volatile and prone to easy manipulation  it 
does not really address the risk aversion problem  the 
additional remuneration should be very high to be effective

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 52 

E: Capacity obligations (i)
•  Motivation
–  Guarantee a regulated adequacy target for the system and 
deﬁne commitments of the individual agents
•  Implementation
–  Mandatory levels of capacity contracts to all load entities
–  ISO &/or regulator determine these levels
–  Organized long-term auctions facilitate transactions
–  Commitments may be traded in the short-term
•  Evaluation
–  Still the ﬁrm capacities are administratively determined
–  There is an identiﬁable commercial product, but no 
commitment to help when actual shortages happen
–  The market determines the price of capacity
–  Consumers are not hedged against high market prices
–  The price of capacity may be (has been) very volatile

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 53 

Case example E: Capacity markets in the US (i)

•  PJM, New York, New England, FERC (proposed in SMD)
–  Day-ahead market, locational prices calculated every ﬁve 
minutes resulting in hourly prices 
•  Motivation: “Guarantee a regulated adequacy target for the 
system & allocate it into commitments for individual agents”
•  The regulator imposes on the demands ... 
–  “Load serving entities” include eligible customers, retailers, ...
... an obligation to buy a certain volume of ﬁrm capacity...
•  which depends on their estimated contribution to system peak 
plus a certain reliability margin
... from the generators
•  whose ﬁrm capacity is also determined by the regulator

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 54 

Case example E: Capacity markets in the US (ii)

•  A market appears from this obligation
–  There are organized markets, but trade is mostly 
bilateral
•  Vertically-integrated companies
–  The market determines the price for capacity
–  There is a product, but no commitment to produce 
when it is needed
•  Low penalties for generators

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 55 

Case example E: Capacity markets in the US (iii)

•  Problems
–  The capacity prices are more short-term signals 
than long-term signals, furthermore they have 
price caps
•  Volatility and risk
–  Locational considerations are not reﬂected
•  Capacity price equal to cero and tight margin in some 
areas 
–  Payments to units that are not really available 
during peak hours

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 56 

Case example E: Capacity markets in the US (iv)

•  Other difﬁculties
–  The reliability in some isolated areas is 
guaranteed by old and expensive units. Since the 
market does not compensate for these units, two 
transitory cost-based methods are used:
•  “Must run agreements” that ensure costs recovery.
•  “Peaking units safe harbor” bids, some units are 
allowed to offer over its marginal costs to recover its 
ﬁxed costs

LICAP (Locational Capacity Market)
•  This was a proposal of ISO-New England to FERC, which 
was meant to be implemented by January 2006 (another 
method was ﬁnally chosen, see later): LICAP
•  Motivation
–  Prices from capacity markets are too volatile
•  Zero if there is excess generating capacity
•  Extremely high if there is a deﬁcit
–  Reduce the vulnerability of capacity markets to the exercise 
of market power  spikes in capacity prices
–   Use a regulated demand-for-generation-capacity curve
–  Besides, reduce the vulnerability of energy markets to the 
exercise of market power  generator is also subject to an 
option selling contract at a strike price equal to the variable 
cost of the peak technology

LICAP: Locational capacity market (iii)
•  Final LICAP payment = LICAP Price – “Energy Spike”
–  But LICAP payment is never negative
–  Affected by the availability in peak hours
•  If a generator is 60% available during shortages or price spikes, 
it earns 60% of LICAP price (always positive)
•  “Energy Spike” = actual inframarginal energy rents of 
efﬁcient peaker including shortage price
–  It is similar to a CfDs with a strike price equal to the variable 
cost of the peak unit 
–  Avoids controversy of estimating energy rents
–  No incentive for supply to create real-time shortages
–  Reduced risk for investors and load

LICAP: Locational capacity market (iv)
•  The demand curve is specially designed for each area
•  The payments would be allocated between the different 
Load Serving Entities depending on its expected demand
•  Problems
–  Opponents to this method say that it will provide windfall 
proﬁts to existing generators without promoting new entry
–  The administratively determined demand curve generates 
uncertainty 
•  There will be another change of mind in the future
–  Scale problems in some of the conﬂictive areas
–  Transmission updates are underway, once they will be 
ﬁnished they will depress the prices in these zones

LICAP: Locational capacity market (v)

•  Pros & cons of this approach
–  Retaining the ʻstatus quoʼ would maintain the current 
inefﬁciencies (more than 300M$ in 2006)
–  Demand curve addresses price volatility problem
–  It could be used as a market power mitigation tool
•  But it is interfering in the short-term market

F. The original reliability options scheme (1)
Motivation
–  Somebody (regulatory authority) acts on behalf of the demand 
and speciﬁes the desired generation adequacy level
–  Consumers: Obtain a well deﬁned commercial product in return 
for their money
•  adequate installed capacity
•  plant availability at the time it is needed
•  a reasonable price cap whenever shortages may occur
–  Generators: Stabilize the most volatile fraction of their revenues
–  A market mechanism is used to determine 
•  The price to be paid to the committed capacity
•  Each generatorʼs committed capacity (how much capacity 
to bid is each generatorʼ decision)

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 63 

F. The original reliability options scheme (2)
Implementation
•  The market authority buys through an auction
–  to the generators
–  on behalf of the entire demand
–  some predeﬁned reliability product, a combination of
•  a ﬁnancial call option …
–  It gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy 
the electricity at a certain predetermined strike price k, instead 
of the spot price s 
–  The seller receives in exchange a premium fee c, the call 
price
… plus a physical delivery obligation 
–  The seller has to pay a penalty P if s > k and 
he is not generating the committed amount of capacity

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 64 

F. The original reliability options scheme (3)
Procedure (i)
•  The regulator determines:
–  The strike price k
•  Frontier between normal energy prices and emergency prices
•  High enough to activate only when the system is in trouble
–  In general, above the operating costs of any generator
–  The penalty P 
–  The time horizon of the auction

Strong points
–  Compared to the energy-only market
•  Additional incentive for new investments, since they stabilize a 
fraction of their income
•  Clear commitment for generators to be available when needed
•  Consumers are protected from high spot prices & their guarantee of 
supply improves (although they pay for it)
–  Compared to the traditional capacity payments mechanism
•  All the previous advantages, & besides:
•  Generation capacity adequacy is guaranteed
•  No need for regulated determination of the value of ﬁrm capacity
•  Capacity payments are determined by the market

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 69 

F. The original reliability options scheme (8)
Potential weak points (may require some positive regulatory 
action)
–  The premium fee may not be enough to attract new entrants, 
since they would like a larger duration of their ﬁxed payments
–  Not easy to ﬁne tune the commitment for generators to be 
available when needed 
•  Gaming opportunities
–  Potential market power abuse in the auctions
•  As in any market, but this case is more critical due to the long-
lasting effects
–  All consumers are protected from very high spot prices
•  It does not promote an active demand response for s > k
–  Capcity margin adopted by regulator & SO impacts on energy 
revenues for all generators

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 70 

Scheme proposed in the Spanish White Paper (i)

•  Keep the present system of “capacity payments” 
with two major improvements
1.  The “capacity payment” now implies a commitment (it 
actually becomes a “reliability option”)
•  To produce an output equal or greater than the 
committed capacity “when needed”, i.e. when the spot 
market price exceeds a threshold (the “strike price”)
–  and provide the power at this strike price
•  Otherwise there will be a strong penalty
•  The regulator assigns the value of the ﬁrm capacity, 
although the generator may ask for a lower value

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 71 

Scheme proposed in the Spanish White Paper (ii) 
(continuation)
2.  A. Treatment for the presently existing units 
–  No auction for existing units (see 2.B for new units)
–  Price is ﬁxed administratively
•  Based on the former capacity payment (to compensate for 
the depressed energy prices) plus the cost of the new 
obligation
–  Opportunity costs of the option (strike sets the 
maximum income)
–  Expected costs of the penalties to be paid due to 
unexpected failures
–  Quantity (committed capacity) deﬁned by the regulator
•  Generators may ask for a lower value

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 72 

Scheme proposed in the Spanish White Paper (ii) 
(continuation)
2.  B. Treatment for the new units
–  Auctions to determine the value of capacity payments of new 
entrants (for 5 years) only if the SO foresees margin below 
threshold 
–  Every year the System Operator evaluates the expected 
reserve margin, looking three years ahead of time
–  The auction is open to new entrants & the resulting 
capacity payment also applies to new existing units (less 
than 5 years old) that have not yet won an auction
–  Required total capacity is deﬁned by the regulator / SO, 
& participants decide the ﬁrm capacity they want to bid
–  Price (capacity payment) is determined by the auction
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 73 

ISO NE: Forward capacity markets (i)
•  This is a different version of the reliability options approach
•  Strike price: heat rate of peaking unit times the fuel price 
(indexed): approx. US$ 200/MWh 
•  Committed agents must produce (or provide reserves) in 
emergency situations (deﬁned by ISO with prescribed rules)
–  Heavy penalty if failure (e.g. payment of 1 month)
–  ISO audits if new future committed agents are expected to be 
available at the committed time
•  Every year the ISO determines the needs for new capacity, 
taking into account any new capacity that has been added to 
the system
–  ISO determines the maximum ﬁrm capacity that each agent can 
bid (they may bid less, but not more)
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 74 

ISO NE: Forward capacity markets (ii)

•  Annual auctions (descending clock) for the estimated total 
need of ﬁrm capacity three years ahead
–  New resources get the capacity payments for 5 years; 
existing units have to participate in the annual auction to 
receive capacity payments
–  Only the resources (generation units& demand)  that have 
participated & won in an auction are paid capacity
–  New and existing resources compete in the auction, but 
prices are set by new resources
–  •All resources need to be qualiﬁed by ISO to participate in 
the auction
–  Wind generation also participates
–  Demand has been very successful in the ﬁrst auctions

Annex 
Detail on “reliability options”

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 77 

Reliability Options (detail) Basic guidelines

•  The mechanism designed should replicate an ideal market where 
consumers and generators engage in  
long-term contracts...
... reducing the risk of the peaking generators
... hedging consumers against high prices 

•  Since it seems that this market is not arising naturally (and this is 
causing problems), the proposed mechanism artiﬁcially creates a 
reliability-oriented long-term market
–  It may only be a transitory procedure

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 78 

Reliability Options (detail) Basic guidelines (ii)

•  The market authority buys
–  to the generators
–  on behalf of the whole demand
–  some predeﬁned reliability product
•  The system authority will be the buyer in this market
–  Instead of consumers, that may not be active enough in this 
ﬁeld
–  This is equivalent to an obligation to buy imposed on 
consumers
–  Buying for the whole of the demand avoids free-riding 
problems

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 79 

Reliability Options (detail) Basic guidelines (iii)

•  The reliability contracts will be allocated through 
an auction  
–  Generators compete to provide the service
–  The price of reliability contracts (capacity) is determined by 
market forces
–  The allocation of these capacity contracts among the 
different generators is determined by market forces

•  Market vs. administrative allocation
–  Market allocation is possible if selling a reliability contract 
has some cost for the generator

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 80 

Reliability Options (detail) The product

•  The reliability product is a combination of
–  a ﬁnancial call option 
•  It gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy  
the electricity at a certain predetermined strike price k, instead 
of the spot price s 
–  If s < k  buyer buys in the spot market at s
–  If s > k  buyer calls the option and buys at k
•  The seller receives in exchange a premium fee c, the 
call price
plus a physical delivery obligation 
•  The seller has to pay a penalty P if s > k and 
he is not generating the committed amount of capacity

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 81 

Reliability Options (detail) The product (ii)

•  For a consumer, having the ISO buying reliability 
contracts on his behalf means:
–  A maximum-price hedge  
•  The energy price he pays is limited to s
•  In addition, he pays the premium fee 
–  its like medical insurance
–  An availability guarantee
•  Sometimes it is more important to avoid rationing
•  It is not a perfect protection, but includes an economic 
compensation

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 82 

Reliability Options (detail) The product (iii)

•  For a generator, selling a reliability contract means:
–  A reduction in his risk 
•  He is changing a volatile and uncertain income...
–  the opportunity to obtain a higher price from the spot market
•  ... for a stable one
–  the premium fee
–  A strong incentive to be available during critical periods
•  Explicit penalty P
•  Implicit penalty (payment derived from the call option)
–  Since the premium fee results from an auction, 
any unit can ask the price it needs to get installed 
(or to stay in the system)

Reliability Options (detail) Procedure

•  The regulator determines:
–  The strike price k
–  The penalty P 
–  The time horizon of the auction
–  The total amount of capacity P to be bought
•  Generators submit bids
–  Price...
•  Minimum premium fee required
–  ... and quantity
•  Capacity committed
–  (Optional) each bid corresponds to a physical facility 
–  Each generator may submit various blocks

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 85 

Reliability Options (detail) Procedure (ii)
•  Market clearing
–  Offers are ordered by price
–  The cheapest are selected until the total amount of 
capacity P is completed 
–  The most expensive accepted bid sets the  
reliability market price, S
–   S is the per-unit premium fee paid to all the accepted bids
•  Thus, a generator with an accepted bid of p MW
–  Always receives p · S (premium fee)
–  Any time s > k, pays (s - k )· p 
–  Any time s > k and pt < p, pays additionally P·(p - pt ) 
•   pt the hourly production of the facility

• 

spot price

•  Having one single strike price makes bids comparable
–  Its value is not critical
It is the frontier between 
–  Normal energy prices
–  Emergency or near-  
rationing prices
It should be high enough to activate only 
when the system is in trouble
–  In general, above the operating costs of any generator
–  Minimum interference with energy market, since this is a 
regulated mechanism

Reliability Options (detail) Procedure (iv)
•  Time frames

The auction 
takes place

Binding period

Lag period
–  The duration of the contracts should be large enough 
to stabilize the income
•  One year may be a good solution 
–  Except odd hydro cycles (El Niño)
–  The lag period facilitates the bidding process of new 
entrants 
•  One or two years

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 88 

Reliability Options (detail) Expected outcome

•  The bid price of any generator would include:
–  The value of the lost income, i.e. when the spot price goes 
above the strike price
•  In principle this component is the same for all generators
•  Decreases with risk aversion
–  The amount paid back to consumers when the generator is 
unavailable
•  The less reliable the generator, the higher it is
•  Increases with risk aversion
–  The value of the penalties to be paid 
•  The less reliable the generator, the higher it is
•  Increases with risk aversion

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 89 

Reliability Options (detail) Expected outcome (ii)
•  Some generators may include an additional term in their bids
–  New entrants: if their remuneration is not enough they will not go on 
with their investment
–  Plants potentially closing: if they do not cover their costs, they will 
leave the market 
•  This additional term would be the difference between
–  Their total market income
–  Their total costs (per year), including:
•  Operation and capital costs for the new entrant
•  Just operation costs for the plant potentially closing
•  Predictability of income is critical for investors  the period 
for which the initial premium applies can be extended for new 
entrants

Reliability Options (detail) Expected outcome (iii)

•  Three typical bidding proﬁles (according to the 
characteristics of generators): 
–  Firm energy (very reliable generators) 
•  Most relevant component in their bid is the foregone income
•  Compensation & penalty are not signiﬁcant
•  Bid should be low 
–  Les-ﬁrm energy (less reliable generators)
•  Same foregone income, but comparatively less important
•  Compensation and penalty are very relevant
•  Price is high
–  New entrants (typically new & reliable; other possibilities)
•  If reliable, same as for ﬁrm energy; but now there is an 
additional term

Implementation details in different market designs

•  Speciﬁc for the scheme proposed in the Spanish 
White Paper
Implementation in a context of excessive market 
– 
concentration
–  Prevent gaming by potential new entrants if they expect 
an auction to happen soon
•  Shared with other schemes
–  Determination of “ﬁrm capacity” in the presence of 
hydro, thermal & intermittent generation

Implementation details in different market designs
(continuation)
• 
•  Speciﬁc of reliability options in different versions
–  The deﬁnition of the “strike price”
–  The role of the “penalty” for not providing the 
assigned ﬁrm capacity when required 
–  Determination of the values of the strike price, the 
penalty, the total required volume of ﬁrm capacity, 
the time horizon & the time lag
–  Preventing that unavailability of the required ﬁrm 
capacity might be hidden via successive markets
– 
Implicit or explicit selection of new investment 
technologies via the implementation details

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 97 

Implementation details in different market designs

• 

(continuation)
– 
Interaction with long-term contracts
–  Choice of lag period with multi-year repetitive 
natural phenomena
–  Lack of price signals to consumers above the strike 
price
–  Firmness of commitments by generators located in 
other countries
–  Safeguard rules to prevent reckless behavior by 
generators

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 98 

In the scheme proposed in the Spanish White Paper 
Preventing gaming while waiting for the auctions

•  Market power
–  The potential for market power in this auction depends on 
the horizontal concentration in the system...
... but also on the volume of new generation that is willing to 
participate in the capacity market
•  Stronger safeguard rules could be implemented if market 
power is a concern
–  The “Spanish version” of reliability options has been 
designed to cope with this problem

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 99 

In the scheme proposed in the Spanish White Paper 
Preventing gaming while waiting for the auctions
•  Ad hoc rules to prevent gaming with the date of 
the auctions
–  The generators already installed (and not older than 
ﬁve years old) that have not taken part in any 
previous auction
•  receive for the time being the standard capacity 
payment
•  can take part in the auction, earning the marginal 
capacity price resulting from the auction until they 
are ﬁve years old

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 100 

In the Spanish White Paper & in other schemes 
The determination of ﬁrm capacity
•  Strongly dependent on the system requirements ...
–  Demand behavior (seasonality, peaking)
–  Generating system characteristics
•  Key factor: share (and characteristics) of the limited energy 
plants 
–  Firm supply = ﬁrm capacity? ﬁrm energy? a mix of both?
•  Firm supply “units” = MW, MWh or MWh*
–  e.g. PJM, Brazil or Guatemala (h*=4 peak hours in the dry 
season)

... & on the design of the regulated capacity scheme
–  May even distort the market behavior (Argentina, Colombia)
–  The higher the capacity incentive the larger the ﬁrm capacity 
that generators will try to make available
•  Which is the ﬁrm capacity of a hydro plant?

• 

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 101 

Deﬁnition of the product in reliability options 
The strike price
•  Theoretical deﬁnition: regulatory frontier between “normal 
functioning” and “near rationing” conditions of the market
–  In principle, the strike price at least should equal the 
highest short-term marginal cost of any unit in the system
•  On the generation side
–  What happens when the variable cost of a signiﬁcant 
fraction of the installed capacity is well above the 
estimated (or desired) price level of rationing?
•  e.g. Peru, Guatemala
•  How to prevent free riding?
•  On the demand side
–  If demand can opt-out, there is also a free riding 
problem
•  e.g. The Netherlands

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 102 

Implementation details in reliability options 
The lag period and the duration
•  The unavoidable market intervention: implicit selection of 
technologies by the adopted implementation scheme
–  Observed undesirable results of implicit incentives
•  Peru and the former capacity payments
–  Regulatory uncertainty reduced the incentive to “efﬁcient” entries
–  Just “ultra expensive” peaking units (minimum investment cost)
•  PJM Reliability Pricing Model and Spain and average valuations
–  Lack of peaking units
–  Quasi-explicit technology selection via product deﬁnition
•  Brazil and the energy call options auctions
–  Fifteen year duration contracts
–  Long-term planning model to solve the auction (considering 
handicaps)
•  Guatemala and the regulated competitive bidding
–  Aimed at base-load generators (strike price deﬁned accordingly)
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 103 

Implementation details in reliability options 
Lack of price signals to consumers
•  Demand
–  Mechanisms could be implemented to provide economic 
signals to demand during high-price periods
•  The total volume of call options P that the OS buys is broken 
down into pieces Pi that are assigned to every consumer/
retailer i
–  This is a minimum quantity (consumer may ask for more)
•  Whenever the spot price s > k, the consumer
–  pays a penalty P for its consumption above Pi
–  receives a bonus P if its consumption is under Pi
–  It is more difﬁcult to implement as it requires individualized 
load predictions for each consumer/retailer

Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 104 

Implementation details in reliability options  
Firmness of commitments from external systems
•  Transmission
–  The penalty P also applies if the committed generation does 
not have the required ﬁrm transmission rights to make its 
generation available when s > k...
... but transmission availability is the responsibility of the ISO
–  For external generators
•  The same requirement of provision of ﬁrm transmission rights
•  Safeguard against foreign regulations
–  Committed foreign generation capacity should not be 
recalled to serve its national demand under emergency 
conditions
•  Need to harmonize European regulations
•  Meanwhile, place the burden on the foreign generator and 
make sure that the penalty P can be applied
Security of supply: is there a problem?  International experiences - 105 

Implementation details in reliability options  
Safeguard rules to prevent excessive risks
•  Safeguard rules
–  A number of safeguard rules can be implemented to 
avoid generators from taking excessive risks
–  Some of them are:
•  No portfolio bidding
•  No bids above nominal capacity are accepted from a 
generator
•  No secondary trading is allowed for the physical 
delivery obligation
•  Financial guarantees
