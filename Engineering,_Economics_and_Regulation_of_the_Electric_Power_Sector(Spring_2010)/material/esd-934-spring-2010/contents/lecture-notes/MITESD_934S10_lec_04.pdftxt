The regulatory function 
& the process of  change of  the 
traditional utility regulation 

Prof. Ignacio J. Pérez-Arriaga 
 

 

“There is a growing consensus that the successful 
development of utility infrastructure – electricity, natural 
gas, telecommunications & and water – depends in no 
small part on the adoption of appropriate public policies 
and the effective implementation of these policies.  

Central to these policies is development of a regulatory 
apparatus that provides stability, protects consumers 
from the abuse of market power, guards consumers and 
operators against political opportunism, and provides 
incentives for service providers to operate efficiently and 
make the needed investments.”

The regulatory function 
 Regulation is the direct &/or indirect control 
by the Government over the behavior of 
private &/or public enterprises in a particular 
sector 
 Items that can be regulated are 
 Revenues, tariffs, quality of service, operating 
decisions, investment decisions, obligation to 
supply or buy, entry & exit rights, etc. 
   but perhaps they should not be regulated

The regulatory function 

 Regulation occurs when the government believes 
that the operator, left to its own devices, would 
behave in a way that is contrary to the government’s 
objectives 
 In many countries an early solution to this perceived 
problem was government provision of the utility 
service 
 Frequent failure of this approach has led to other 
solutions 
 Private participation in service provision under a 
“regulated monopoly” scheme 
 Unbundling & liberalization of some activities that are left 
to competition forces 
“Material for this transparency has been borrowed from “The Body of Knowledge” 

7 

The regulatory function 

 Governments establish regulation to improve the 
performance of a sector with respect to no regulation 
 What is meant by “improve sector performance”? 
 Regulation should be intended to improve “welfare”, i.e., the 
aggregate benefit that the sector services provide to 
consumers & operators, including also the externalities 
 “sector performance”can be measured in terms of consumer surplus, 
service availability, cost efficiency, affordability of prices, range of 
services offered, quality & rate of innovation 
 In reality, regulation may also serve other purposes, typically 
short-term objectives of a government, typically to gain 
some political advantage

Typical regulatory concerns 

  Prices / tariffs to consumers 
  Quality of service 
  Economic viability of the firms 
  Environmental impact of the activities of the sector 
  Policies for services to the poor or those without access 
  Market structure & market power 
  Adequacy of investment, as well as its efficient operation, to 
meet demand 
  Information asymmetry of regulator & firms 

11 

Typical regulatory instruments 
  Cost-of-service subject to regulatory oversight 
  Price cap or revenue cap 
  Unbundling of activities 
  Subjecting agents to competitive pressures 
  Competition “in the market” 
  Competition “for the market” 
  Benchmarking of regulated monopolies 
  Application of economic (or other) incentives 
  Use of command & control (standards, targets, penalties, etc.) 
  Conditions in licenses to operate 
  Conditions in authorization of mergers & acquisitions 
  Obtaining & analyzing information 
  Monitoring market behavior

Regulatory institutions 

Regulatory powers must be allocated among  
 Ministries / Government 
 They should establish laws under which the regulator performs her 
function 
 Independent Regulatory Commission 
 Competition Authority 
 Judiciary 
Timewise, those powers may be exercised 
 Ex ante: Authorize / promote / mandate changes in the 
power system business structure  
 Ex post: Penalize anticompetive behaviors 

13 

Regulatory institutions 
 The regulatory function is frequently organised at 
several levels: 
 In the US there are state regulators (PUC, Public Utility 
Commissions) and one federal regulator (FERC) 
 In the EU there are member state regulators represented 
in the ERGEG, cooperating with the European Commission 
(DG TREN), as required by the 2003 EU directives for gas 
& electricity 
 The new Energy regulatory package will create a European 
Regulatory Agency (ACER) 
 Regulators are organised in regional associations 
such as: CEER and ERRA in Europe, NARUC in North 
America, ARIAE in South America

Topics for discussion 
Are sectoral regulators really needed? 
•  The Competition Authority could: 
•  prevent and repress abuse of dominant  position by the 
network (system) operators 
•  ensure competition in the commercial activities 
 & technical regulation could be left to the companies 
themselves 
•  This does not appear to be a good solution since: 
•  Technical regulation can be biased 
•  The Competition Authority intervenes only ex-post and 
typically has trouble in gathering evidence of violations & 
understanding the complex issues involved 

19 

Topics for discussion 
Is regulation a temporary activity? 
•  Does the need for regulation decrease after 
the first phase of restructuring / liberalisation? 
•  Regulation is still required both for the networks (natural 
monopolies) and for the competitive markets (like in the 
case of financial markets)  
•  The trend happens to be just the opposite. In the power 
sector the content of the regulatory activity has changed, 
but the volume has probably increased 
•  Long-term issues (climate change, energy security, 
provision of universal access) require regulatory 
intervention in the power sector 

20

Design of regulatory agencies 
Basic issues 
  Activities that should / should not be regulated 
  Division of responsibilities between government, competition 
authority, sectoral regulators & judiciary 
  Jurisdiction of regulator over one or more sectors 
  Responsibility in creation & enforcement of norms 
  Level of regulator´s independence of Government 
  Accountability of the regulator 
  Single regulator versus a commission 
  Codes of ethical conduct 
  Use of advisory boards with stakeholders & public hearings 

21 

Design of regulatory agencies 
Basic issues 
 The institutional arrangements in the design of 
regulatory agencies should encourage 
 Independence 
 Transparency (so regulator can be held accountable) 
 Predictability (consistency over time so stakeholders can anticipate 
how the regulator will resolve issues) 
 Legitimacy (regulator is not captured by special interests) 
 Credibility (stakeholders can trust that commitments will be 
kept) 
 of the regulatory system 

22 

11 

Design of regulatory agencies  
Basic issues (detail) 
 Structure: single regulator vs. a board 
 Board  (3, 5, 7, 9!): more plural & stable 
 Single regulator: more swift & flexible & less costly 
 Jurisdiction 
 Sectorial: more specialized 
 Common to several sectors: less costly, synergies & more 
independent 
 Review & appeal 
 Ministry review  politicize regulation 
 Judicial review  preferably if courts can overrule regulator 
only on procedural grounds & not on the substance of the 
regulatory decision 

23 

Design of regulatory agencies  
Basic issues (detail) 
 Regulatory processes: Administrative mechanisms 
to receive stakeholders’ inputs & to solve stakeholders’ 
complaints 
 Advisory boards 
 Public hearings 
 Transparent, well-established administrative procedures 
 Negotiated settlements & arbitration 

24 

12 

Design of regulatory agencies  
Basic issues (detail) 
•  Independence and democratic legitimacy 
•  Legitimacy is based on: 
 Legal basis, mandate, limitations 
 Appointment procedure 
 Accountability to Parliament 
 Judicial review 
 Linked to transparency & predictability 
•  The independence of the regulator varies 
according to national approaches and traditions 
•  E.g.: A minimum of independence is required by the EU 
Directives, but countries differ widely 
25 

Design of regulatory agencies  
Basic issues (detail) 
 How to achieve independence? 
 The goal is to minimize the influence of short-term 
pressures from government, parties or other lobbying 
groups & from the regulated agents 
 Transparent selection process of Board members, with 
final proposal by Goverment & approval (would just a 
hearing be enough?) by Parliament 
 Single mandates, without renewal 
 Need for stable & sufficient financing of the institution 
 Restrictions in the exercise of professional activity after 
the term of  appointment expires (avoid “revolving doors”)

“All competition is imperfect; the preferred remedy 
is to try to diminish the imperfection. Even when 
highly imperfect, it can often be a valuable 
supplement to regulation. 
But to the extent that it is intolerably imperfect, the 
only acceptable alternative is regulation. And for the 
inescapable imperfections of regulation, the only 
available remedy is to try to make it work better” 

Alfred Kahn, “The economics of regulation” 
MIT Press, 1988

Traditional regulation 
Typical features 

 Public service obligation in franchise territory 
 Voluntary coordination transactions of limited 
importance among utilities 
 Regulated monopoly 
 The electric utility makes all economic & technical 
decisions: centralized planning & operation 
 Under regulatory review (frequent overlap of public 
ownership & regulation) 
 Cost-of-service remuneration 
 Regulated tariffs

an infinite time horizon and under uncertainty? 
Use a temporal hierarchy of decisions 
 Decision functions hierarchically chained 
 Each function optimizes its own decisions subject to

Time scales (2) 

20 

Traditional regulation 
Cost-of-service remuneration (1) 
 Typical steps in the process (“revenue requirements” 
in the US): 
1  Establish the Regulated Asset Base (RAB or “rate 
base”) 
2  Establish the rate-of-return on capital 
3  Determine the incurred costs 
 Operation & maintenance 
 Depreciation 
 Remuneration of capital 
 Taxes 
4  Determine the tariff to be paid by each consumer 
type, so that total costs are recovered 

41 

Traditional regulation 
Cost-of-service remuneration (2) 

Total cost of service = 
= Operation & maintenance costs + 
+ depreciation + 
+ rate-of-return on capital x rate base - 
- additional revenues + taxes 

Average cost of service (average rate or tariff) = 
= total cost of service / total energy sales (*) 
(*) This is just an indicative figure, which does not apply to any specific consumer type  
42 

21 

Definitions (1) 
 Rate base (regulated asset base, RAB) 
 Net fixed assets (i.e. less the cumulative 
depreciation) plus current assets (e.g. inventory of 
fuel & replacement parts, advance payments & 
deferred revenues) 
 Rate of return 
 Average weighted interest rate over the long-term 
financial resources of the firm 
 Depreciation 
 Typically linear; each type of asset is assigned an 
economic life 

Definitions (2) 
 Operation & maintenance costs 
 Fuel costs, materials & replacement parts, energy 
purchases, supervision, personnel & overhead 
 Taxes 
 On profit, revenue, property, social security & 
construction 
 Additional revenue 
 Expenses & revenues deriving from the sale of the 
firm’s property, revenues from wholesale energy 
sales, other revenues from non electric activities 

43 

44 

22 

Some controversial issues 

 Use of actual or estimated values (the problem 
of the “regulatory lag” & the “deviations”) 
 Determination of a “fair & reasonable” rate of 
return on equity 
 Adequate method to determine the value of 
the assets (historic cost, replacement value, “fair” 
value) 
 Treatment of the fixed assets in progress 
 Accounting treatment of deferred taxes (when 
accelerated depreciation is used) 

46 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

  
  

 

Traditional regulation 
Determination of retail tariffs 

Typical steps in the process: 
1  Classify consumers into homogeneous types (define the 
“tariff structure”)) 
2  Unbundle the total cost of service into generation, 
transmission, distribution & other 
3  Further unbundle each element of (2) into a capacity, 
energy &/or per-consumer component 
 Time periods can also be introduced 
4  Assign each element in (3) to each consumer type 
5  Adjust the charges in (4) to the actual metering 
capabilities of each consumer type 

47 

23 

Tariffs of wholesale power sales (1) 

Classification (US): 
 Sales to distribution utilities 
 There is obligation of supply 
 Tariff is determined with a similar process to retail 
tariffs 
 Coordination transactions (all the others) 
 many kinds, depending on the product 
 The selling utility has to submit the tariffs to the 
regulator for approval 

50 

25 

Tariffs of wholesale power sales (2) 

Determination of tariffs for the coordination 
transactions: 
 Many possible kinds of transactions 
 Short, medium or long-term firm power / firm 
power from a plant / system firm power / diversity 
interchanges / reserves / maintenance / 
emergency / economic transactions/ etc.  
 Criteria to compute the tariff 
 Assign to capacity ($/kW), energy ($/kWh) or per 
customer ($) depending on the cost component 
51 

Strong points in the traditional 
regulatory framework 
 Regulatory stability 
 Guarantee of cost recovery (with adequate 
remuneration)  
 Favorable climate for investment 
 Reduce capital costs 
 High guarantee of supply for the consumers 
 Makes it easier to incorporate “social obligations” 
 Social tariffs 
 R&D 
 Protection of domestic fuels 
 Energy diversification 
 Environmental protection 

52 

26 

Weak points in the traditional 
regulatory framework 

 Consumers absorb most of the risk 
 Planning errors, demand forecast, technological 
obsolescence, etc.  
 Abuse of public service obligations (the electric 
utility as tax collector) 
 Domestic fuels, energy diversification, nuclear 
moratorium, tariff discounts, local taxes, etc. 
 Incentivates excessive investment 
 Regulatory risk for shareholders 
 “regulatory lags” & “prudent expenditures” 

53 

Traditional regulation 
Additional comments 
 It is possible to use advanced tariffication 
schemes that are based on marginal pricing 
principles (“real time pricing”) 
 To make this compatible with cost-of-service 
remuneration, some “revenue reconciliation” 
scheme has to be applied 
 It is possible (easier than within the competitive 
framework) to make the utilities incorporate 
energy policy objectives & constraints in their 
planning & operation functions, e.g.: 
 “integrated resource planning” 
 load management

55 

The new regulation  
Why? (1) 
 Competition is possible in generation 
(wholesale market)  
 Enhanced transmission network capacity  larger 
relevant markets  no economies of scale in 
generation 
 New generation technologies (CCGT)  smaller 
size, shorter installation time, reduced 
environmental impact  long-term marginal costs 
smaller than average generation costs (1990s)  
good perspectives with new capacity (in theory) 

56 

28 

Details 
Advances in generation technology (1) 
 60’s - 80’s 
 typical capacity of coal-fired & nuclear units: 600 
to 1000 MW 
 long construction time: 6 to 10 years 
 decisions on generation expansion were taken 
long before the capacity was needed 
 very large investments and frequent cost overruns 
 only large, vertically integrated utilities under 
cost-of-service remuneration were able to make 
the necessary investments 

57 

Details 
Advances in generation technology (2) 
 90’s - 00’s (CCGT technology) 
 optimal plant capacity may be less than 300 MW 
 construction time may be less than 2 years 
 much smaller investment per installed kW than 
other base-load technologies 
 wide availability of natural gas 
 lower environmental impact / regulatory 
uncertainty 
 investment decisions can be made by smaller 
agents  

58 

29 

The new regulation  
Why? (2) 

 Competition is possible in supply (retail 
market)  
 Technological advances in metering, 
communications & information processing  
facilitate multiplicity of commercial transactions 
 Favorable economic climate  
 Global trend towards liberalization 
 Interest to facilitate privatization 

The new regulation  
Why? (3) 

 Shortcomings of the traditional model 
 Excessive governmental intervention 
 Conflictive role of Government as owner & 
regulator 
 Inefficient management (in general) 
 Lack of public investment capacity (in some 
specific cases) 

59 

60 

30 

The new regulation  
Why? (4) 

 Additional goals 
 Reduce prices (more developed countries) & 
better align prices with costs (less developed 
ones) 
 Stimulate retail and demand-side activities 
 Market-driven retirement of old, dirty & costly 
generating plants 
 Competition for competition’s sake 

61 

The new regulation: How?  
Specific regulation of each activity 

62 

31 

The new regulation  
Basic features 
 Unbundling of activities 
 generation & retailing are open to competition 
 transmission & distribution remain regulated 
 diverse alternatives with system & market operation  
 End consumers can choose supplier (retail market) 
 Wholesale market: organized &/or bilateral 
 Diverse contracts (physical, financial) to hedge the risk 
 Operation & investment planning is no longer a 
centralized activity 
 Independent regulator 

63 

The new regulation  
Basic policies 
 Liberalization 
 of the wholesale market 
 of the retail market 
 Restructuring 
 unbundling of vertically integrated activities 
 action (if needed) on horizontal concentration 
 Privatization 
 The need for transition measures

The new regulation 
Structural aspects of the power industry 
 When the structure of the industry is inadequate for 
competition, the solution is not a better set of rules, 
but a structural change or gradual / partial 
liberalization 
 Horizontal concentration in generation 
 What matters is the size of the relevant market 
 Interconnection capacity may be a critical issue 
 Vertical integration 
 Between regulated & non regulated activities  
•  cross subsidies may occur  
•  self dealing (generation, distribution with captive consumers) 
 Between regulated activities  conflicts of interest 

66 

33 

(continuation) 

 Level of eligibility of consumers 
 Complete eligibility reduces the problem of vertical 
integration and also of horizontal concentration in the 
distribution + retail business 
 Diagonal integration 
 Integration between electricity companies & fuel 
suppliers will be questionable if the fuel supply market 
is not fully competitive 

The new regulation 
Unbundling of activities 

 Accounting, legal or ownership unbundling 
 A regulation open to competition requires 
unbundling of 
 Regulated from liberalized activities 
 Regulated activities with conflicts of interest 
 Analysis of the transaction costs 
 unbundling + commercial transactions versus 
implicit internal transactions 

67 

68 

34 

Some difficulties 
Stranded generation costs  
 Stranded costs (or Competition Transition charges, 
CTC) 
 Conceptually: Difference between an estimate of 
generation remuneration with previous regulation 
& the new market-based regulation 
 Note that: 
 Market revenues are uncertain 
 Frequently there are discrepancies with respect to 
future regulated revenues 
 In practice the amount & conditions for CTC 
recovery have been the outcome of a negotiation 
process 

69 

Some difficulties 
Stranded benefits 

 Stranded benefits: public goods that may 
be lost because of a regulatory change 
 Environmental protection 
 Since the market price does not include most 
environmental costs 
 Vulnerable consumer protection (social tariffs) 
 Universal extension of access to electricity 
 Other (technological diversification, R&D, etc.)

Gradual liberalization of generation 

1) “External generation” (Non Utility Generation, NUG) 
with “avoided cost” remuneration (“qualifying facilities”) 
2) BOO contracts (build-operate-own) / BOT (build-operate-
transfer) after sporadic public auctions 
3) Competitive bidding after systematic public auctions & 
remuneration according to contracts 
4) Independent generators (independent power producers o 
IPPs) with limited access to the network or to 
consumers 
5) Independent generators (IPPs) with complete access to 
the network and to consumers

1) "Qualifying facilities” (US) 

 The term qualifying facilities appears in the 
PURPA Act (US) in 1978 
 Objective: to promote cogeneration & renewables 
 Mecanism:  guarantee  of  energy  acquisition  by  the 
electric utility by means of a long-term contract 
 Price: “avoided cost” for the utility 
 Requirements: 
 Cogenerators  (any  size)  &  small  generators  (<  80  MW) 
with > 75% from renewable energy sources 
 < 50% of ownership of the generating company 

73 

2) BOO/BOT supply contracts 

 The  contractor  is  selected  via  an  ad  hoc  competitive 
bidding process that is organized by the utility itself 
 The contractor has to build, operate & own (BOO) &/or 
transfer the plant (BOT) 
 Contract to purchase the energy 
  Power Purchase Agrement (PPA) 
 Remuneration according to the terms of the contract & 
independent  from  the  process  of  determination  of  the 
regulated  tariffs (although tariffs values are affected by this). 
Typically it includes: 
 Energy payment  
 Capacity payment 

74 

37 

3) Competitive bidding 

 Mecanism  to  add  new  generation.  This  is  an 
extension of the energy contracts BOO or BOT 
 Remuneration  according  to  the  terms  that  are 
established in the accepted bid 
 Standard procedure: 
 Step  1:  Estimation  by  the  utility  of  the  needs  of  new 
capacity 
 Step 2: Estimation of the avoided cost (optional) 
 Step 3: Preparation of the request for bids 
 Step 4: Evaluation & selection of bids 
 Step 5: Negociation & signature of the contract 

75 

4) IPPs (limited access) 

 The  plants  are  built  by  initiative  of  the    IPPs,  &  they 
are typically backed by electricity sale contracts 
 There are no standard formats for the contracts 
 The financial risk has been passed from the consumers 
to the IPPs 
 Direct  sales  of  IPPs  to  generating  &/or  distributing 
companies  are  forbidden  (e.g.,  EEUU  Energy  Policy 
Act, 1992). Limited access to the network 

76 

38 

5) IPPs (complete access) 
 Similar to case 4 
 Now  it  is  possible  the  direct  sale  to  the  final 
consumer (& also to the utility, as before) 
 Full  access  to  the  transmission  network  is 
mandatory 
 It  implies  the  complete  liberalization  and 
unrestricted  entry 
into 
the  generation 
business

The new regulation  
Power sector organization models  
 Four representative models (*) 
 abstractions; they do not describe specific systems & reality 
has created a diversity of models that do not fit well into these 
categories 
 Correspond to varying degrees of monopoly, 
competition & choice  
 Public or private ownership is ignored 
  Model 1: monopoly at all levels 
  Model 2: purchasing agency 
  Model 3: wholesale competition 
  Model 4: wholesale & retail competition

Model 1: Monopoly 
Description 
 Full vertical integration 
 Some distribution companies may be unbundled 
 Central planning of generation & network 
 Cost-of-service remuneration of each vertically 
integrated utility  regulated tariffs 
 Wholesale transactions 
 between vertically integrated utilities  
 between a distributor & a vertically integrated utility 
 with wheeling transmission charges 
 Limited incentive regulation is possible 
 Social policy obligations 

81 

82 

41 

Model 1: Monopoly 
Comments 
 Most risks are passed to consumers 
 mistakes in investment, demand forecast, 
technological obsolescence, etc.  
 Frequent abuse of social policy obligations (utility 
as tax collector) 
 indigenous fuels, fuel diversity, nuclear moratoria, 
electricity discounts, local taxes, etc. 
 Regulatory lag & “prudent expenditures” 
 adequate rate of return to investors 
 Pressure from cheap potential new entrants

Model 2: Purchasing agency 
Description (1) 
 Less vertical integration than model 1 
 Independent Power Producers (IPPs) compete to 
sell to the single purchasing agency 
 competition (e.g. bids) in construction, operation & 
negotiation of contracts (PPAs) with the single buyer 
 mandatory purchase at “avoided cost” (questionable) 
 Purchasing agency is responsible for generation 
adequacy 
 Limited economic incentives in PPA contracts 
 availability payments, indexation of variable costs 
85 

Model 2: Purchasing agency 
Description (2) 

 Cost-of-service, PPA contracts & social policy 
obligations  regulated tariff 
 Wholesale transactions: as in model 1. IPPs 
do not have retail access 
 Purchasing agency (via consumers’ tariffs) 
takes the generators’ risk in the PPA contracts 
 Independence of the purchasing agency 
becomes a critical issue (economic dispatch) 

86 

43 

Model 2: Purchasing agency 
Comments 

 Some competition on the generation side, 
while the purchasing agency keeps centralized 
strategic control 
 Typical drawbacks of centralized planning 
 Risk of IPPs is passed to consumers  lower 
capital costs & easier to raise capital 
 Exquisite control of PPA contracts is needed 
(corruption)

Model 3: Wholesale competition 
Description (1) 

 Free transactions between distributors & 
generators, thus sharing risks 
 Distributors (now multiple purchasing agencies) 
maintain a monopoly over final consumers  
regulated tariffs 
 Social policy obligations must be charged via 
regulated tariffs 
 No central planning of generation, free entry  
 Generation stranded costs & benefits appear 
89 

Model 3: Wholesale competition 
Description (2) 

 Trading arrangements 
 open access & ancillary services  system operator 
 organized markets (spot, derivatives)  market 
operator (not a single buyer, but an auctioneer) 
 bilateral wholesale contracts 
 IPPs may choose between contracts & the spot 
market 
 regulated network access charges 

90 

45 

Model 3: Wholesale competition 
Comments 

 IPPs may / may not be vertically integrated 
with distributors (risk of self dealing) 
 Issues of market power are now relevant 
 Long term guarantee of supply is in principle 
left to the market 
 Strong incentive to efficiency in generation 
 Pressure from consumers to arrive at retail 
competition

Model 4: Wholesale & retail 
competition. Description (1) 

 All customers have access to competing 
generators either directly or through their 
choice of retailer  regulated tariffs only as a 
back-up option 
 Social policy obligations only via access tariffs 
 Complete separation of generation & retailing 
from the networks (transmission & distribution) 

93 

Model 4: Retail & wholesale 
competition. Comments (1) 
 The short-term energy market (day-ahead, 
balancing) becomes essential as a reference for 
the transactions 
 Advantages of more precise metering 
 Generation stranded costs & benefits appear  
 gradual eligibility of consumers may help 
 vesting contracts may help 
 levies via access charges may help 
 Issues of market power are now relevant 
 Long term guarantee of supply is in principle left to 
the market 
 Strong incentive to efficiency in generation 

94 

47 

Model 4: Retail & wholesale 
competition. Comments (2) 

 Integration of generation & retailing is no longer a 
problem (consumer may choose supplier) 
 But integration of distribution & retailing has to be 
closely supervised 
 Stand-alone retailing is high-risk / low-return 
 Demand may respond to market prices 
 New retailing-like opportunities appear: energy 
service companies 
 General arguments for competition favor model 4

 Non regulated, free entry / exit, network access 
 Multiple services 
 energy production 
 ancillary services 
 market mechanisms, whenever possible 
 charge costs to responsible parties

Regulation of electrical activities 
Generation planning? 

 At the individual generators’ level 
 market price is the basic uncertainty 
 investment planning is an exercise in financial risk 
 decision-making can be aided by models 
 At system’ s level 
 indicative planning at most 
 Issue: long-term guarantee of supply 

100 

50 

Long term guarantee of supply 

 Relevant issues 
 Responsibility for guarantee of supply 
 Adequacy of market economic signals in relation with 
reliability & security of the power system 
 Market price when there is loss of supply 
 Adequacy of market prices for peaking units 
 Risk aversion & adequate generation investment levels 
 Consumers’ choice of level of guarantee of supply 
 Basic options 
 Leave it to the market 
 Regulated economic incentives 
 Mandatory contract cover 
 Availability markets 

101 

Regulation of electrical activities 
Transmission (1) 

 Regulated natural monopoly (as distribution) 
 Regulatory differences with distribution network 
 reduced amount of new major facilities  an individualized 
supervision is possible 
 small impact on the final quality of service for the small 
customers, in general  
 Transmission network is “the meeting point” in a 
competitive market at wholesale level  its regulation 
is critical for the wholesale market efficiency 

102 

51 

Regulation of electrical activities 
Transmission (2) 

 Comparatively low cost in general 
 the larger the costs & the need for new costly investments, 
the higher the regulatory complexity should be 
 Unbundling from system operation 
 synergies vs. conflicts of interest 
 Major regulatory issues 
 Access, investment & pricing 

103 

Regulation of electrical activities

   COMPETITIVE MARKET 
 Open access 
 Same, with more emphasis 
on efficiency & 
performance incentives 
 Increased user participation 
based on adequate 
economic signals 
 Pricing is a critical issue 
since it affects competition 

 Centralized optimal 
planning 

 Pricing is a non issue 

104 

52 

Regulation of electrical activities 
Transmission (4) 

 Access 
 From priority rules for capacity reservation to purely market-
based mechanisms in the short-term to solve for congestions 
 Investment 
 From central planning to authorization of proposals submitted 
by coalitions of agents to light handed supervision with price 
control & grid code requirements 
 Pricing 
 From nodal pricing to uniform market prices. A large variety 
of methods to allocate transmission sunk costs 

105 

Regulation of electrical activities 
Distribution 
 Distribution is a network activity 
 network expansion planning 
 line construction 
 maintenance scheduling 
 maintenance work 
 network operation 
 Retailing is a different activity 
 Major regulatory issues in distribution 
 Access, investment, pricing 

106 

53 

What is particular about 
distribution regulation? 

  Distribution must be regulated as a natural monopoly 
  Distribution must be regulated separately from transmission 
  little significance (so far) for the wholesale market 
  very large number of facilities prevents individualized treatment  
regulation must be based on global performance 
  directly connected to final users  quality of service becomes a 
critical issue 
  Objective: optimal trade-off between cost (investment, 
operation, losses) and quality of service  

107 

Distribution investment 

 The remuneration scheme must incentivate 
that the regulatory objective is achieved 
 There is no widely accepted approach 
 How to deal with distribution losses? 
 Economic incentives to achieve a prescribed 
target level of losses 
 How to deal with quality of service? 
 Economic incentives to meet minimum levels of 
quality of service 
 continuity, voltage distortions, client attention 

108 

54 

Distribution pricing 

 Objective: To allocate the global 
remuneration of the distribution network to 
the individual customers 
 Distribution charges are a component of 
 the integral tariff (for non-qualified consumers) 
 the access tariff (for qualified consumers) 
 Distribution charges should 
 be cost reflective 
 completely recover the network costs 

109 

Distribution access 

 Objective: To establish the rules of use of the 
distribution network so that 
 no agent is discriminated 
 there is no abuse of the monopolistic power of the 
distributor 
 Adequate procedures & network charges for 
 connection to the network 
 use of the network

Regulation of electrical activities 
Supply (retailing) (1) 

 Retailing for non qualified (captive) consumers 
 Regulated activity 
 cost-of-service regulation 
 standards of quality of service 
 Business risk depends on the specific regulation 
 from full pass-through to a priori regulated tariff 
 desirable a moderate incentive to efficient purchasing 

112 

56 

Regulation of electrical activities 
Supply (retailing) (2) 

 Retailing for qualified consumers 
 Non regulated activity 
 Business of high risk, high turnover & small margin 
 association with a generation company reduces risk 
 Adequate regulatory supervision is needed to prevent 
discriminatory behavior by any associated distribution 
company 
 Supply of last resort 

113 

Regulation of electrical activities 
System Operation 
 Regulated coordination activity 
 Cost-of-service remuneration 
 Specific performance-based incentives are possible 
 Independence with respect to the agents of the 
system is critical 
 Pros & cons of the diverse options of 
governance 
 system operator / market operator / transmission 
 both synergies & conflicts of interest exist 

114 

57 

Regulation of electrical activities 
Market Operation (Power Exchanges) 

 Coordination activity, regulated (under cost-of-
service remuneration) or not (charges for services 
provided) 
 Multiple market operators are possible 
 Must be independent with respect to the 
agents of the system 
 Diversity of markets & contracts, both for 
system agents & external arbitrageurs
