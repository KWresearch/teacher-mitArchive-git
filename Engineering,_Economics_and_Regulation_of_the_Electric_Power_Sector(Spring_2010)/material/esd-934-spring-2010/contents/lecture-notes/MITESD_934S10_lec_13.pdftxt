Bidding  code  of  good  practice  to  prevent  the  exercise  of  market 
power1 

Start  by  reading  the  Bidding  Code  of  Practice  (BCoP)  that  has  to  be  followed  by  the 
agents  in  the  Single  Electricity  Market  (SEM)  of  Ireland.  (See  the  reading  material  1 
below;  concentrate  your  reading  on  the  Annex  of  the  document,  which  is  the  actual 
code).  

Assume now a mostly thermal electric power system, with the following market design: 

•  Complex bids: up  to 5  (Q, P) pairs per generating unit and per hour, plus  start-
up costs.  

•  Consumers pay to generators on the basis of the system marginal energy price. 
The system marginal price of energy at any given hour  is computed as  the sum 
of two terms: 
o  The  price  P  (€/MWh)  of  the  last  (i.e.  more  expensive)  (Q,  P)  pair  that 
has been used to meet the market demand. 
o  The  sum  of  the  costs  (€)  of  all  start-ups  that  have  taken  place  during 
that hour.  

The  system  is  such  that  the minimum  cost  dispatch  dictates  that  several  thermal  units 
will have to shut down during the night and early morning, when demand is lowest, and 
then  they  will  have  to  start-up  again  when  demand  picks  up  later  during  the  morning. 
Now assume the following situations: 

•  SITUATION  A:  In  order  to  avoid  this  two-shift  regime,  some  generators modify 
their  bids,  either  by  reducing  the  value  of  P  in  their  first  (Q,  P)  pair  or  by 
increasing  the declared start-up cost. Do you  think  that  this  is  in violation of  the 
BCoP? 

•  SITUATION  B:  Some  generators  realize  that  the  two-shift  regime  increases 
significantly their maintenance costs. Assume, for instance, that a forced outage 
of three days of duration happens approximately after 25 start-ups. Do you think 
that  including  these  extra  costs  in  the  bids  somehow  (by  the  way,  how  do  you 
suggest to do it?) would be in violation of the BCoP? 

•  SITUATION  C:  Assume  now  that  in  the  considered  market  there  is  a  capacity 
payment  mechanism  to  remunerate  generators  with  a  daily  amount  whenever 
the generator  is available. The  same generators as  in Situation B  consider  that 
a  regime  of  two  shifts  will  increase  the  chance  of  being  unavailable  and  losing

Bidding Code of Practice had to be interpreted.  

the  capacity  payment  remuneration.  Again,  do  you  think  that  including  these 
extra  costs  in  the  bids  somehow  (by  the  way,  how  do  you  suggest  to  do  it?) 
would be in violation of the BCoP? 

•  SITUATION D: Assume now  that  in  the same considered market one generator 
includes  in  its  energy  bids  (for  the  spot  market  of  the  next  day)  the  estimated 
foregone  (i.e.,  lost  or  not  received)  profit  for  the  generator  on  the  following  day 
if, when  trying  to  start-up  the  plant,  it  fails  to  function  and  it  has  to  be  down  for 
one  entire  day. This  foregone  profit  is  computed  as  the  profit  that would  not  be 
obtained  on  the  next  day  (if  the  unit  fails  when  starting  up)  multiplied  by  the 
probability that the generator fails to start up.
