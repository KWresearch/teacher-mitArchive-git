Assignment 8 

The assignment is to combine all system specific description portions of the past homeworks into a single 
(Word) document. No need to change any content, just copy and paste into a single file (OK maybe add 
headings for each section). Then post it to the course website. 

This assignment will: 
  1) Provide you with a single place to refer back to about your system 
  2) We think this will be useful enough that we plan to make all of these documents available to the entire 
class after the due date, such that we all have a least a basic set of information for a wide range of 
systems. 

Due Date 

The assignment is due the same day as the Final Project Report, in Lecture # 27. 

Grading 

Grading for the consolidated system assignment will be as follows: 
+ Full credit for copying and pasting your existing system description sections into one word 
document with headers and possibly, if needed short one line notes to alert readers to sections that you 
later realized were wrong. There is no need to make corrections, just warn would be readers of any known 
problems. 
- In addition, you optionally have the opportunity to revise some past system description/analysis 
sections that you wished you had gotten a better grade on. This is by no means required and will not 
affect the grade on the consolidated assignment. However, this is a limited chance to improve your grade 
on the past assignment. If you opt to do so, please e-mail the instructors with the specific parts of the new 
consolidated system description to re-consider. This option does not apply to the non-system specific 
quantitative questions (e.g. RPI-X, Unit Commitment, Nodal Prices, etc) 

What to include 

The general idea is any question or part that says "for your chosen system" or something similar should be 
included and are hence available for re-grading. This includes answers that are based on your opinion 
(just be clear that is your opinion) including critiques of, discussions of, or suggested alternatives to what 
is currently done now. 

If this somehow seems to vague, here is a list of the parts we are looking for: 
HW1-all 
HW2-all 
HW3-Q1 
HW4-Q2 step 1 only (load duration curve) and only if found for your actual system 
HW5-Q1-all parts, Q2-all parts, Q3 - part A only, Q4 - part C only. 
HW6-Q1 
HW7-Q1 A, not the bullets (just the retail market & tariffs for your system) & Q2 first bullet (capacity 
mechanism in your system)
