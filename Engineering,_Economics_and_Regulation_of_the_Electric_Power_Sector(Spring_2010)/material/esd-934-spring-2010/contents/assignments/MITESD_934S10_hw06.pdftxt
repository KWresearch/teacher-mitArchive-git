Question  1.  Transmission  regulation  in  the  system  /  country  of  your 
choice. 

Describe  the  regulation of  the  transmission activity  in  the  country or  system  that  you have 
chosen. Organize your answer by addressing the following issues: 
•	 Select  within  the  corresponding  Electricity  Act  (or  the  highest  level  norm  that  applies) 
those  articles  that  correspond  to  the  functioning  and  regulation  of  the  transmission 
activity. 

•	

Identify  the  secondary  regulation  that  describes  in  more  detail  the  rules  and 
organization of the transmission activity: 
o	

Investment:  How  is  the  transmission  network  planned? Who  is  responsible  for 
preparing  /  approving  the  plan? How  is  the  transmission  activity  remunerated? 
Does this scheme correspond to any of the approaches discussed in class? 
o	 Pricing: 
 A)  Is  there  any  impact  of  the  network  on  the  energy  prices? How  is  the 
transmission  network  taken  into  account  in  the  determination  of  the 
energy prices and the dispatch of the generators? 

 B)  How  are  the  transmission  tariffs  computed?  Is  there  any  locational 
signal or time differentiation in the transmission tariffs? 
o	 Access: 
 A)  What  method  of  generalized  (and  local,  if  different)  congestion 
management is used in your system? 

For each one of these  items  include a brief description that can be sufficient for somebody 
who does not know  this market  to understand how  it works,  ignoring  the details. Give your 
opinion on the adequacy of the approach with respect to sound regulatory principles. 

Provide the list of relevant references that you have used to answer this question. 

If,  for some reason, you do not  find  information on your system  to answer any of  the  items 
above,  do  your  best  effort  in  filling  the  gaps  with  your  opinions  (please,  indicate  explicitly 
when you are not describing what actually happens in the system of your choice). 

Question  2.  Transmission  regulation  proposals  for  specific  case 
examples 
There  is  still  an  on-going  debate  concerning  some  critical  issues  in  the  regulation 
of electricity transmission. Cost allocation (i.e., the design of transmission charges) 
is  one  of  these  issues.  How  necessary  or  useful  it  is  to  send  economic  locational 
signals  to  existing  and  /  or  future  market  agents?  What  are  the  criteria  to  design 
these signals? 
The  following  case  studies  try  to  show  the  difficulties  in  adapting  the  general 
regulatory principles for transmission pricing to the specific cases of each particular 
case  or  power  system  and,  how,  in  case  of  doubt,  one  should  try  to  deviate  as 
least as possible  from  those principles. You have  to show  that you understand  the 
basic  principles  and  that  you  have  dedicated  some  time  to  think  of  the  problem. 
There may be no perfect solution to any of these cases. 

CASE 2A. Backbone transmission project in Central America. 
The  figure  below  depicts  a  major  transmission  corridor  (the  SIEPAC  line)  that  is 
presently  being  built  linking  six  Central  American  countries.  A  major  issue  related 
to  the  construction  of  this  line  was  the  design  of  the  transmission  charges,  i.e., 
what  the  network  users  in  the  different  countries  have  to  pay  to  cover  the  total 
costs of construction plus operation & maintenance of the line. 
The  initial  proposal  for  transmission  pricing  of  the  SIEPAC  line  was  to  charge  its 
cost  to any  international  transaction whose  flow of power would use any  fraction of 
the  capacity  of  the  line.  Some  electrical-engineering-based  algorithm  would  be 
used to determine the power flows associated to any given transaction. 
Question: What do you  think of  this pricing proposal?  If applied, what do you  think 
would be its impact on the regional market?

CASE 2B. Wind in the North Sea. 

The North  Sea Offshore  grid  project  is  estimated  to  connect  70 GW  offshore wind
and have an investment cost of €30 billion. 

The  following  financial  calculations  have  been  made  for  the  grid  project:  If  it  is
assumed 1800 hours/year of power  factor (it seems quite  low) and an actualization 
rate  of  10%  for  the  cost  of  capital,  the  investment  could  be  recovered  in  20  years
by  a  charge  of  about  30 € /MWh  to  any  MWh  that  is  exported  from  the  off-shore 
wind generators. 

The  regulator  decides  to  apply  50%  of  this  charge  to  the  generators  and  the  other
50%  to  the consumers who  import  the power  from  the off-shore generators. Let us
assume  that  these  consumers  are  located  in  The  Netherlands.  However,  it 
happens  that  the  average  price  of  the  electricity  in  the  wholesale  market  in  The
Netherlands  is  about  40 € /MWh,  so  the  transmission  charge  would  discourage 
buying  from  the  off-shore  wind  generators.  Is  there  anything  wrong  with  the 
transmission pricing rule that is proposed by the regulator? 

CASE 2C. Wind in MISO. 

From the news in the press (Nov. 18, 2009):

“The  American  Wind  Energy  Association  (AWEA)  is  turning  primarily  to  Midwest

governors, FERC, state regulators and other policy makers rather than the Midwest 
ISO  (MISO)  stakeholder  process  to  rectify  what  the  association  says  is  a  setback 
after FERC approved an interim transmission cost allocation proposal for the MISO 
market  that  will  dramatically  increase  wind  developers'  costs  of  interconnecting 
new generation, says an AWEA official. 
The  official with  AWEA,  the  national wind  industry  association,  says  the  group will 
continue  to participate  in  the MISO  stakeholder process, but  fears  it  is  "doomed  to 
failure"  because  member  utilities  will  seek  to  obstruct  new  lines  that  threaten  to 
devalue  their  generation  assets.  Thus,  the  wind  industry  group  will  direct  the  bulk 
of  its  advocacy  efforts  toward  Midwest  governors  and  others  policy  makers  to 
influence  the  process.  "The  main  goal  is  to  get  that  long  term  policy  right,"  the 
official says. 
On  Oct.  23,  FERC  approved  a  MISO  interim  proposal  for  spreading  costs 
associated  with  network  upgrades  that  are  needed  to  accommodate  new 
generation  interconnection.  Under  the  new  scheme,  generators  will  pay  100 
percent  of  the  interconnection  costs  for  lines  below  345kV  and  90  percent  for 
facilities  at  or  above  345kV  (with  the  extra  10  percent  paid  by  all  of MISO),  a  cost 
that is too high for the wind generators, AWEA contends. 
This  new  cost  allocation  scheme  dramatically  changes  the  previous  methodology 
in MISO under which generators paid  for approximately 50 percent of  the upgrade 
costs and the local utilities paid the other 50 percent.

Question: What do you think of this new decision by FERC? What basic principles 
should the regulator use to address this problem? 

CASE 2D. Wind in Spain. 

Propose  the  regulation  for  transmission  network  investment  that  you  consider  is 
most appropriate for a country as described below: 

Part 1. 
•	 Spain  has  more  or  less  a  rounded  shape  and,  although  there  are  several 
major load centers, it can be assumed that the electricity demand is more or 
less  evenly  distributed.  The  transmission  network  is  well  meshed  and  in 
1997  there  was  no  need  for  important  or  very  expensive  new  transmission 
investments. The cost of  transmission  represents about 5% of  the  total cost 
of electricity. Let us assume that demand grows 3% per year. 
•	 Generation  and  supply  have  been  liberalized,  and  a  complete  unbundling 
among  regulated  and  competitive  activities  has  been  achieved.  There  is  a 
Transmission System Operator that acts as System Operator and also owns 
transmission assets. 

Question  1:  The  issues  to  be  decided  are:  What  is  in  your  opinion  the  best 
regulatory  approach  to  make  decisions  about  the  investments  in  transmission 
network  facilities  in  this  country,  how  this  investment  should  be  remunerated  and 
the basic guidelines on how to charge this cost to the network users. 
Part 2. 

•	 A  new  situation  appears  in  the  early  2000s.  Demand  of  electricity  was 
growing fast, at a rate of about 5% per year, and the peak load was growing 
even  faster.  There  were  many  potential  investors  in  new  CCGT  power 
plants,  all  of  them  requesting  connection  to  the  network  and  environmental 
authorization  permits.  Although  it  was  clear  that  most  of  this  potential 
investment  would  not  materialize,  it  is  not  known  which  among  the  new 
proposed new plants will be built and which ones will not. 
•	 At  the  same  time,  as  a  result  of  a  successful  policy  of  promotion  of  new 
renewable resources, there were a very large number of applications of new 
connections  to  the  network  for  wind  farms.  Again,  most  of  them  are  not 
expected to take place, since in many cases the applicants just want to have 
the  paperwork  ready  so  that  the  site  could  be  later  sold  to  a  wind  farm 
developer.  But  it  is  also  true  that  many  wind  farms  were  built  at  the  time 
(and now). 
•	 Therefore,  the  most  adequate  development  and  the  additional  cost  of  the 
transmission network will be highly dependent on the volume and location of 
the new CCGT power plants and wind farms that will be built. 

Question  2:  Would  you  change  the  recommendation  on  transmission  investment 
and pricing that you gave in question 1? 

CASE 2E. New hydro in Peru. 

The  country  is  large  and  50%  of  the  demand  is  concentrated  around  the  capital. 
There are other two or three major load centers and the remaining demand is small 
and  dispersed.  The  transmission  network  is  neither  well  meshed  nor  developed 
and  there  is  much  need  for  some  new  lines  to  alleviate  frequent  congestions. 
There  are  several  large  gas  fields  and  good  hydro  sites,  but  all  of  them  are 
removed  from  the  large  load  centers.  The  cost  of  transmission  represents  about 
15%  of  the  total  cost  of  electricity. The  government  looks  for  foreign  investment  to 
develop the transmission network. 

An  investor  is  considering  building  a  new  hydro  plant  250  km  from  the  country’s 
capital,  where  the  demand  is  growing  fast.  A  new  line  200  km  long  would  be 
needed  to connect  the new plant  to  the main  transmission grid. On  the other hand, 
a new pipeline  is supplying natural gas to the capital, so that there  is the possibility 
of building gas power plants nearby. 

The  country  needs  foreign  investment  to  develop  its  energy  infrastructures,  such 
as power plants and transmission lines. 

Question: How would you charge the cost of the 200 km line?

case studies. They can also be used for further reading:

Question 3. Computation of nodal prices 

This  is  the  solved  case  of  the  optimal  generation  dispatch,  electricity  flows  and 
nodal prices in a simple three-node example without any network constraints1. 

Question: Find  the value of  the nodal prices  in  the  figure below, when  the  line 1-3 
has  a  maximum  capacity  of  600  MW.  Give  also  an  intuitive  explanation  to  the 
values that you have obtained.

Remember  that  the  impedance  of  the  line  is  a  generalization  in  alternating  current  of  the  concept  of 
resistance in direct current.
