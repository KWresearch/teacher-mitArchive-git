Homework HW1. 

. 

Select one power system of interest to you, preferably from the list that is provided below. If the 
system of your choice is not included in the list, you will have to discuss with the instructor if it 
is an adequate system for the objectives of the course. 

During  the  course  you  will  have  to  learn  about  this  power  system,  analyze  it  under  different 
viewpoints and  suggest  improvements  to  its  regulatory  framework. The  term paper may be also 
based  on  this  system.  This  first  assignment  just  consists  of  making  your  choice  and  writing  a 
couple of pages at most  (Times New Roman 11 point or similar, single space)  indicating which 
is your  choice,  if  there  is  any  special  reason  for  it  and  the  sources of  information  that you have 
found  so  far. Use  the  references and websites  in  the “Resources” document  to  learn more about 
the characteristics of the different systems that could be of interest to you. 

You may reconsider your choice later (but not too late). You can also be advised to modify your 
choice if there are too many coincidences with your classmates.
