Homework HW4. Optimization models & microeconomics 

Question 1. A simple generation Unit Commitment model. 
In  this  question,  we  will  consider  a  highly  simplified  unit  commitment  model  to 
determine  which  power  plants  to  connect  to  the  system  (unit  commitment,  UC)  and 
what output power to operate at (economic dispatch, ED) during each time period. 
In Simpleland,  the  electricity  demand  follows  a  repeating  daily  pattern  at  two  levels: A 
Low  level of DL  = 1000 MW  for TL = 20 hours,  followed by a high  level of DH  = 1500 
MW for TH = 4 hours, and so on. 
Simpleland  electric  power  company  has  3  generation  units  as  described  in  the  table 
below: 

Plant Name 
Papa Bear 
Mama Bear 
Baby Bear 

Rated Capacity  Technical Minimum  Variable Cost  Startup Cost 
Csu, $/start 
Cvar, $/MWh 
Pmin, MW 
Pmax, MW 
$40,000

1200 
1500 
1200 
500

$10,000 
$3,000

600 

a)  Write  the  complete  set  of  equations  of  the  UC+ED  problem  using  either 
mathematical notation or words. 
b)  Give  the  optimal  solution  to  this  problem  (you  should  be  able  do  it  by  inspection, 
after  all  this  is  Simpleland).  If  you  wish,  you  could  write  and  solve  a  computer  model 
for this problem, but it is not required. 
c)  What  is  the  marginal  cost  of  electricity  at  each  one  of  these  two  periods?  Do  all 
generation  units  recover  their  total  costs  with  the  dispatch  schedule  and  the  prices  that 
you have computed? If not, is this acceptable and what solution do you propose? 
d) Simpleland experiences a population boom, and load increases to DL  = 1200MW, DH 
= 1800MW. Repeat parts b&c for this case. 
e) The Olympics  and World Cup overlap  and TV watching  extends  long  into  the night, 
increasing  the  duration  of  the  peak  period,  TH  to  8  hours  (at  the  post-boom  demand 
levels). Repeat parts b&c for this case. 
f) The Simple PUC (Public Utility Commission) decides to deregulate the electric sector 
and convert  to an open market using simple bids (pairs of variable cost and output  level 
only).  Assume  that  each  generator  was  sold  to  a  separate  operating  company.  The 

Olympics  are  over,  but  the  population  is  still  increased. What  is  the  resulting  dispatch 
profile? Repeat part c for this case. 

Question 2. The dilemma of the peaking generation plants. 
<Recommended:  Read  page  58  and  following  ones  of  P.  Joskow,  “The  difficult 
transition  to  competitive  electricity  markets  in  the  US”,  2003 

Step  1:  Create  the  annual  load  duration  curve  (or  some  reasonable  approximation)  for 
the system you have chosen. In some cases annual reports will show this figure directly, 
in other cases you can construct one based on a year of hourly  load data. Hourly data  is 
often  readily  available  on  market  operator’s  websites.  In  addition,  for  the  US,  some 
historic  data  is  available  through  FERC  form  714  at:  http://www.ferc.gov/docs-
filing/forms/form-714/data.asp 
Note: Do  not  spend much  time  with  this.  If  you  have  difficulty  obtaining  a  full  year  of 
data, estimate one based on a  few  representative days  from various  seasons of  the year. 
If you have difficulty finding the information, consider estimating it based on a different 
similar  system  or  invent  one.  In  all  cases,  clearly  cite  your  data  sources  and 
approximations. 
Step 2: Using the following data: 
1.	 The load duration curve from Step 1. 
2.	 The  annual  capital  cost  of  a  competitive  (“best  technology”)  peaking  unit.  Use 
$100,000/MW  per  year  unless  you  happen  to  have  a  better  value  (in  this  case 
indicate  your  sources).  If  you  want  to  learn  how  to  obtain  this  cost,  read  the 
document  in  the  reference material:  “Fixed Cost of  a Best New Entrant Peaking 
Plant”,  Single  Electricity  Market  Committee 
of 
Ireland, 
2009, 
http://www.allislandproject.org/ 
3.	 The  estimated  cost  for  the  average  demand  of  loss  of  electricity  supply  (5,000 
$/MWh).  Assume  that  this  is  the  market  price  of  electricity  whenever  there  is 
not enough generation to meet all the demand. 
Answer the following questions: 
a.	 Describe  the  resulting  dilemma  of  the  peaking  units  from  the  complementary 
viewpoints  of  the  potential  investor  in  a  peaking  plant,  the  consumer  and  the 
regulator: 
•	
Investor: Under which conditions would the investor be willing to build a 
new peaking plant? Do you think that investing is a reasonable decision? 
•	 Regulator:  Would  a  regulator  be  satisfied  with  a  market  that  functions 
under  an  energy-only  pricing  rule?  Is  an  acceptable  level  of  investment 
to  be  expected?  Do  you  think  that  generators  should  be  allowed  to  bid 
whatever  price  they  want  or  should  they  be  mandated  to  bid  variable 
costs  strictly  (under  threat  of  abuse  of  market  power)?  Would  it  be  a 
good  idea  to  establish  a  price  cap  of  1,000  $/MWh  to  the  market 
electricity price? 
•	 Consumer:  Should  the  regulator  protect  consumers  somehow  or  do  you 
think  that  consumers  would  prefer  to  protect  themselves  against  high 
prices  and  power  shortages,  without  any  regulatory  intervention?  How 
could they protect themselves? 
b.	 Any suggestion to address this dilemma?
