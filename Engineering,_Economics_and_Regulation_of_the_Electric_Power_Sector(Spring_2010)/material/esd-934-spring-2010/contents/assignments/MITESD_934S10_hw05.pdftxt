Homework HW5. Market power and wholesale market design 

Question 1. Description of a specific wholesale electricity market. 

Describe the wholesale electricity market in the country or system that you have chosen. 
Organize your answer by addressing the following issues: 
A.  Select  within  the  corresponding  Electricity  Act  (or  the  highest  level  norm  that 
applies)  those  articles  that  correspond  to  the  functioning  and  regulation  of  the 
wholesale  electricity  market.  Identify  the  secondary  regulation  that  describes  in 
more  detail  the  rules  and  organization  of  the wholesale market:  type  of market  and 
level  of  liberalization,  transactions  that  are  allowed  in  this  market,  agents  that  can 
participate,  existence  of  organized  trading  platforms,  allocation  of  the  roles  of 
system  operation  and  market  operation,  rules  for  the  functioning  of  the  short-term 
(day-ahead,  then maybe spot,  typically) market, how  the prices of  these markets are 
computed, type of auctions that is used (simple or complex bids, any other features), 
procedure  of  determination  and  allocation  of  the  operating  reserves,  any  intraday 
markets, management of congestions, basic norms of the balancing market. For each 
one  of  these  items  include  a  brief  description  that  can  be  sufficient  for  somebody 
who  does  not  know  this  market  to  understand  how  it  works,  ignoring  the  details 
(market  rules  or  trading  codes  typically  have  500  pages  or  more).  <To  be  added 
once  we  cover  the  module  on  the  transmission  network:  How  this  market  handles 
network losses and congestions. If you already understand it you may start including 
this information now.> 

B.  If  available,  describe  the motivation  that  led  to  the  creation  of  this market.  Provide 
some  description  of  how  this  wholesale market  has  functioned  since  it  was  created 
or  during  the  last  few  years:  Adequacy  of  its  structure  (number  and  size  of  the 
agents,  private  or  public  ownership,  any  other  relevant  characteristic  of  the  agents, 
mergers and acquisitions  that have  taken place),  role of  the  system operator, market 
operator,  transmission owners, governance of  the market, prices and volumes  in  the 
several markets (day-ahead, spot, reserves, congestion, intraday, balancing), imports 
and  exports,  any  significant  incidents,  existence  (proved  or  supposed)  of  market 
power abuse, any other characteristic trait. 

C.  Provide the list of relevant references that you have used to answer this question. 

If,  for  some  reason,  you  do  not  find  information  on  your  system  to  answer  any  of  the 
items  above,  do  your  best  effort  in  filling  the  gaps with  your  opinions  (please,  indicate 
explicitly  when  you  are  not  describing  what  actually  happens  in  the  system  of  your 
choice). 

Question 2. Market structure and competition. 

A.  Do  you  consider  that  the  present  level  of  horizontal  concentration  in  your  power 
system  is  compatible with  the  existence  of  a working  electricity wholesale market? 
Do you  consider  that  there  is  any other major barrier  that  should be  removed  if you 
want  a  wholesale  market  to  function  correctly  (or  to  create  one,  whatever  is  the 
case?  If  the  answer  is  affirmative,  indicate  (in  priority  order:  first  those  measures 
that  you  would  recommend  first)  the  regulatory measures  that  you  would  advise  to 
adopt. Justify your answer. 
B.  You  have 	 to  hypothesize  an  operation  of  acquisition  or  of  voluntary  merger 
involving  the  largest generation utility  in your power  system  and  another  large one, 
also within  your  power  system, which  also  owns  generation  assets  (if  this  situation 
does not exist  in your market,  just  invent  it). Now you are supposed  to examine  this 
situation  as  a  regulator  with  responsibilities  on  competition  matters,  as  well  as  on 
the proper functioning of  the wholesale generation market. You are asked  to give or 
to  deny  the  authorization  for  this  operation  and  to  explain  the  reasons  for  your 
decision.  The  authorization  might  be  subject  to  conditions  to  alleviate  any 
undesirable  situation  of  excessive  concentration  and  subsequent  market  power, 
vertical  or  diagonal  integration.  If  you  think  that  the  operation  should  be  subject  to 
conditions, indicate which type of conditions and justify your answer. 
Try  to  answer  this  question  as  much  as  possible  within  the  actual  legal,  economic, 
political and social context of the specific power system and its institutions. 

Question 3. Market structure and competition. 
Now we examine the potential of long-term contracts as an instrument for market power 
mitigation  and  other  purposes.  In  some  countries  (Ireland,  for  instance)  it  has  been 
considered,  or  actually  implemented,  a  method  to  reduce  market  power  of  the  large 
incumbent  generation  companies  (like  ESB  in  Ireland  or  Endesa  or  Iberdrola  in  Spain) 
that  is  based  on  long-term  contracts.  This  same  method  was  proposed,  for  instance,  in 
the  2005  Spanish  White  paper  on  the  electricity  market.  The  method  consists  of 
mandating  the  dominant  generation  companies  to  sign  long-term  (e.g.  3  years  or more) 
contracts  with  consumers  or  load-serving  entities  (retailers  of  different  kinds).  The 
minimum volume of  these contracts and  its price  is  fixed ex ante by  the  regulator. Give 
your opinion on the following issues: 

A.  Do you think that this is an effective method to mitigate market power? How would 
you  implement  this regulation? Which are  the pros & cons of  this approach? Would 
you  propose  another  regulatory  instrument?  Think  of  this  in  the  context  of  your 
power system. 

B.  How  significant  is  the  potential  interference  of  this  regulatory  mechanism  on  the 
functioning  of  the  short-term market?  Identify  all  possible  effects  of  this  regulatory 
measure on the market behaviour and classify them as desirable or harmful. 

These  “directed  contracts”  (this  is  the  terminology  in  Ireland)  or  “contratos  virtuales” 
(virtual  contracts,  terminology  in  the  Spanish  White  Paper)  can  be  used  for  a  dual 
purpose without  losing  its  capability  to mitigate market power. This  second  application 
is to extract rents from the generation companies that are mandated to sign contracts at a 
regulated  price,  for  instance  to  counteract  windfall  profits  that  result  from  a  cap-and-
trade mechanism to limit CO2 emissions1, such as the EU ETS, or from other sources. 

1  Think of some nuclear power plants or hydro plants  that were built more  than  twenty years ago.  If now 
a  CO2  price  is  imposed  on  any  emissions  from  electricity  generation  units,  the  energy market  price will 
increase and  therefore  the  revenues of all generators. The  regulator may want  to  intervene and claw back 

C.  Does this new use of the “directed contracts” (or “virtual contracts”) reduce their 
capability  to mitigate market  power? Does  it  augment  any  possible  interference 
with the functioning of the market? Do you think that this is an effective method 
to  extract  any  excessive  rents  from  generation  companies? Would  you  propose 
any other regulatory instruments? 

Question 4. CO2 and electricity markets.  
A.  Examine  the  implications  that  the  introduction  of  a  price  for  CO2  emissions  (some 
externally determined price  in $/ton of CO2  emitted) would have on generators  and 
consumers of a vertically integrated electric utility that is regulated under traditional 
cost-of-service. 
B.  Examine  the  implications  that  the  introduction  of  a  price  for  CO2  emissions  (some 
externally determined price  in $/ton of CO2  emitted) would have on generators  and 
consumers in a power system that has fully adopted a market oriented approach. 
C.  Examine  the  implications  that  the  introduction  of  a  cap-and-trade  system  for  CO2 
emissions would have on the power system of your choice. 

some  of  these  extra  revenues  with  some  kind  of  windfall  tax  or  a  regulatory  scheme  as  the  one  that  is 
proposed here.
