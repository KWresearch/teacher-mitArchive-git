Homework HW3 

. 

Question 1. The distribution activity in the system of your choice.  
(Note that the idea is that you gradually build a document, piece by piece, on the regulation 
in  the  power  system  that  you  have  chosen.  At  the  end  of  the  course  you  will  be  asked  to 
place all  the pieces  together  in a  single document, without much  special editing, but where 
you can  show  that you have a  sufficient understanding of  the  functioning and  regulation of 
this system). 

Here  you  have  to  describe  the  distribution  regulation  in  the  power  system  of  your  choice, 
taking  into  account  the  topics  that  have  been  presented  in  module  C.  The  following 
procedure is suggested: 
•	 Find  in  the  corresponding Electricity Act  (or  the  highest  level  norm  that  applies)  those 
articles  that  correspond  with  the  distribution  activity  and  its  regulation.  Then  also  find 
the  secondary  regulation  (e.g.  decrees,  ministerial  orders,  technical  regulations)  that 
develops  in  more  detail  the  regulation  of  distribution.  You  may  comment  on  the 
following topics: 
o	

 (Again)  Distribution  companies  in  the  country:  number,  size  (type  and  size  of 
the supplied region and number of customers), private or public ownership. 
o	 Legal  procedures  that  govern  the  exercise  of  the  distribution  activity: 
distribution  licenses  and  specific  conditions;  accounting,  legal  or  ownership 
unbundling;  administrative  procedures  to  authorize  distribution  installations, 
etc. 
o	 Mechanism  for  setting  annual  distribution  revenues:  cost  of  service  regulation, 
or price  cap, or  revenue  cap  formulas. The procedures  that  the  regulator uses  to 
establish the remuneration in each rate case or price control period.  
o	 Tariffs.  A  first  idea  on  how  distribution  revenues  are  reflected  in  the  final 
customer tariffs. Any network connection charges. 
o	 Quality  of  service.  Is  there  any  explicit  quality  of  service  regulation?  Are 
penalties or credits being applied to the distribution company if it does not meet 
or exceeds any prescribed quality standards? 
o	 Network  losses.  Is  there  any  mechanism  implemented  to  provide  incentives  to 
distribution  companies  to  reduce  network  losses?  If  this  is  the  case,  what 

procedure  is  followed  by  the  regulator  to  set  the  level  of  standard  network 
losses? 
o	 Distributed  generation.  Has  any  specific  regulation  been  developed  to  connect 
distributed  generation  to  distribution  networks?  Do  distributed  generators  pay 
connection  or  use-of-system  charges?  Which  are  the  most  relevant  issues  that 
affect distributors regarding connection of distributed generation? 
o	 Provide  the  list  of  relevant  references  that  you  have  used  to  answer  this 
question. 

It  is  understood  that  it  may  be  difficult  in  some  cases  to  find  the  documents  (when  they 
exist)  that  contain  the  necessary  information  to  answer  these  questions.  We  have  not 
covered  tariffs  in class yet, so  the necessary background has not been provided. Make your 
best effort; explain what you have obtained and, if you have not found enough information, 
answer  the questions by explaining what you consider  that should be done,  instead of what 
is  actually  done. Make  it  clear  when  you  describe  what  exists  or  when  you  are  presenting 
what you recommend to do. 

Question 2 

Propose  an  incentive  scheme  for  distribution  companies  to  optimize  the  level  of  network 
losses. You can obtain inspiration from the incentive scheme for quality of service that was 
described in class. 

Question 3 

The  provided  EXCEL  spreadsheet  shows  a  simplified  version  of  the  process  of 
computation  of  the  remuneration  of  a  regulated  electricity  distribution  utility  under  a 
method of RPI-X with revenue cap. The time interval for the price control is 5 years. 

INPUT DATA: 
The input data for the spreadsheet are in red colour in the spreadsheet itself: 

•	 Equity: % of the rate base of the firm that is owned by its shareholders. 
•	 Debt: % of the rate base of the firm that has been borrowed. 
•	 Rate of return on equity: re 
•	 Rate of return of the debt: rd 
•	 Tax percentage: % of taxes that is applied to the benefits before taxes (BAI, 

beneficio antes de impuestos).

•	 Rate base on the initial year. 
•	 Economic life of every item in the rate base: this is the number of years that are 
assumed to be needed to depreciate the assets. 
Investments: estimated increments of the rate base. 
•	
•	 RPI: estimated retail price index (inflation) in %. 
•	 ΔDemand: estimated percentage of annual increment of the volume of distributed 
electricity. 
•	 Estimated annual Operation & Maintenance costs (O&M costs). 

THE COMPUTATION PROCESS: 

The annual costs for year n are computed with the equation: 

Total  costs  (n)  =  O&M  costs  (n)  +  Depreciation  (n)  +  Rate  Asset  Base  (n-1)  x  WACC 
(before taxes) 

To start the process, one has to fix or compute the remuneration (revenues) for the first year 
(year  0),  which  can  be  assumed  to  be  equal  to  the  annual  costs  for  that  year.  Next,  the 
revenues  (or  the  revenue  caps)  for  the  following  years  2  to  5  are  computed  using  the 
equation below: 

R(n+1) = R(n) x (1 + RPI – X) x (1 + α x ΔDemand) 

where  you  have  to  discuss  what  is  the  proper  utilization  of  the  parameter  α  and  the 
increment in demand ΔDemand in this spreadsheet. 

The  adjustment  parameter  X  (named  the  “efficiency  factor”  in  most  of  the  literature  on 
RPI-X)  is  determined  so  that  the  total  net  present  value  (NPV)  of  the  maximum  allowed 
annual  revenues  (the  “revenue  cap”)  for  all years of  the price  control period  is  equal  to  the 
NPV of the annual costs estimated by the regulator for the same period. 

Next,  the  spreadsheet  (for  illustrative  purposes  about  the  basic  features  of  accounting  of  a 
company  and  to  describe  some  of  the  assumptions  in  the  Excel  spreadsheet)  presents  the 
Profit  and  Loss  account  of  the  firm.  It  can  be  verified  that  the  NPV  of  the  benefits  after 
taxes  (BDI,  “beneficios  despues  de  impuestos”,  in Spanish)  coincides with  the NPV  of  the 
remuneration of the equity with the established rate of return before tax (re=10%). 

Finally,  the  spreadsheet  shows  the  annual  financial  situation  of  the  distribution  company: 
Note  that  the cash flow generated each year by  the company  is devoted  to pay for  the costs 
of  new  investments  and  to  reduce  debt  (while  maintaining  the  same  equity  to  debt  ratio). 
Any remainder is devoted to pay dividends. 

THE QUESTIONS TO BE SOLVED: 
1.	 Examine  the  role of  the  factor  (1 + α.∆D)  in  the equation above.  Is  it used properly 
here? How  should  it  be  used,  if  at  all? How  do  you  think  that  an  appropriate  value 
of  α  (0.41  in  the  spreadsheet)  should  be  determined  for  a  correct  utilization  of  this 
equation? 

2.	 Modify  now  the  spreadsheet  by  setting  α  to  zero,  so  that  the  term  (1  +  α.∆D)  does 
not  have  any  effect  on  the  outcome.  Determine  the  value  of  X  by  playing  with  the 
Excel  spreadsheet  (it  has  been  given  an  initial  value  of  0).  Which  is  the  rate  of 
return of the equity (benefit of equity after taxes / equity) for the company? 

3.	 What  do  you  think  of  the  equation  that  has  been  used  in  the  spreadsheet  to 
determine  the  Operation  &  Maintenance  costs?  Assume  now  that  the  regulator 
estimates  that  efficient  O&M  costs  should  be  50,  50.5,  51.0,  51.5  and  52.  Which 
should be the value of X? Would you expect X to be larger or smaller now? Why? 

4.	

In  the  spreadsheet  of  the  preceding  point  2,  which  is  the  correct  value  of  X  if  the 
regulator establishes  that  the economic  life of  the assets should be 20 years? Would 
you expect X to be larger or smaller now? What is the new value of X? 

5.	 Assume  that  the  regulator  establishes  a  value  of  X  that  is  equal  to  what  was 
determined  in  bullet  2  above.  However,  in  reality  the  demand  growth  is  different 
from what was estimated a priori (4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0 and 3.0 percent), with  the actual 
values  being  4.0,  4.5,  4.0,  4.0  and  4.0  percent.  Then  what  should  the  allowed 
revenues of  the distribution company be  for each year of  the control period? Which 
is  the  new  rate  of  return  of  the  equity  (benefit  of  equity  after  taxes  /  equity)  for  the 
company? 

DIRECTIONS: 

•	 The answers  to  the questions  (not your excel spreadsheets) above have  to be handed 
in.  Provide  clear  and  concise  answers,  with  some  explanation  on  how  you 
have reached the solutions, but not the spreadsheet with numbers.
