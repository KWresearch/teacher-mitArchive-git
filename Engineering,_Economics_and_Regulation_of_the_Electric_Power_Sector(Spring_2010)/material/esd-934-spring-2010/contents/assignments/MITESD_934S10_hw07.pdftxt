Question 1 (Retail markets and tariffs) 
A.  Briefly  (1  page  is  enough,  write 	 more  if  you  prefer  and  you  have  enough 
information)  describe  the  basic  characteristics  of  the  retail  market  in  the  power 
system  of  your  choice.  Are  there  default  tariffs?  And  any  last  resource  tariff 
scheme? 
As a bonus in this question (I know it is difficult, sometimes impossible, to find this 
information):  Could  you  explain  how  the  default  tariff,  or  any  applicable  tariff  in 
your system, is computed? 
•	 Consider a power system with a flat default tariff that is recalculated every year and 
where  the  consumers have  the possibility of  switching back  and  forth  (from default 
tariff  to  the  offer  of  any  retail  supplier  or  buying  directly  from  the  market  at  spot 
price)  at  any  time,  with  no  charges  for  switching,  just  giving  one  week  advance 
notice.  As  a  consumer,  can  you  figure  out  a  scheme  to  fool  the  system  in  your 
benefit?  As  a  regulator,  can  you  figure  out  a  mechanism  to  avoid  that  the  system 
could be fooled? 
•	 Are  tariffs  that  differentiate  by  utilization  factors  discriminatory?  How  about  those 
tariffs  that  apply  Ramsey  pricing  to  allocate  the  costs  of  promotion  of  energy 
efficiency or support to renewable energies or any other regulated charges? 

Question 2 (Capacity mechanisms) 
•	 Describe  the  method  (if  any)  that  has  been  adopted  in  the  power  system  of  your 
choice  to  promote  investment  in  new  generation  capacity.  No  method  is  also  a 
method.  Provide  your  evaluation  of  this method  and  suggest  the  approach  that  you 
consider  is  most  adequate  to  achieve  an  adequate  level  of  generation  capacity  in 
your system. Justify your answer. 
•	 Assume now  that  the  regulator of a hypothetical country C  (not  the country of your 
choice) has decided  to adopt  the method of  reliability options or  something  similar, 
like  the  forward  capacity  mechanism  in  ISO  New  England.  The  regulator  asks  for 
your  advice  to  design  the  specific  rules  in  the  implementation  of  the  method.  You 
realize  that  the  structure  of  the  market  in  country  C  has  a  high  level  of  horizontal 
concentration  and,  therefore,  the  periodic  auctions  that  are  required  by  the  method 
have  a  high  risk  of  being  manipulated  by  the  largest  agents,  resulting  in  very  high 
prices  for  the  capacity.  What  changes  would  you  introduce  in  the  method  of 
reliability options in order to eliminate, or to mitigate at least, this problem?
