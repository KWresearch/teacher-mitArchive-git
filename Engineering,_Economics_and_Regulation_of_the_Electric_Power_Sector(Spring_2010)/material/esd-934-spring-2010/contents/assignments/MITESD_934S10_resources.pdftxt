Regulation of  the power  industry  is a  fast evolving  field  that  requires  to be  followed on 
a  real  time  basis.  The  websites  listed  below  provide  a  broad  overview  of  relevant 
regulatory  institutions  and  recent  developments,  and  they  are  also  a  good  starting  point 
for searches on specific topics 

- The  International  Energy  Regulatory  Network  (IERN)  is  a  web  platform  that 
facilitates  information  exchange  on  electricity  and  natural  gas market  regulation,  to 
the  benefit  of  regulators,  but  also  of  other  interested  users.  This  website  is  a  good 
starting point when searching about detailed energy regulation of a specific country. 
It is maintained by the regulatory agencies themselves, under the coordination of the 
Florence  School  of  Regulation.  IERN  is  an  initiative  of  several  regional  regulatory 
organizations, CEER, ERRA and ARIAE and in 2009 it has become the home of the 
International  Confederation  of  Energy  Regulators  (ICER).  The  information  is 
updated  by  the  regulatory  agencies  themselves,  under  the  supervision  of  the 
Florence School of Regulation, which is a centre for training, research and debate on 
regulation  based  at 
the  European  University  Institute 
in  Fiesole  (Italy).
