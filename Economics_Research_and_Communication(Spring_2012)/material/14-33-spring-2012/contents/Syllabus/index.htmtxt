***** 14.33 Policies *****
    * You are permitted, in fact encouraged, to discuss all course material
      with other students in the class. However, you must, obviously, hand in
      your own individual papers. Discussion with others is intended to clarify
      ideas, concepts, and technical questions, not to derive group papers.
    * In fairness to students who complete assignments on time, students
      failing to hand in the proposal or assigned section drafts on time will
      receive no credit for that assignment. We will accept late papers, but
      their grades will be penalized a half a letter grade a day for lateness.
    * Cheating or academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated and
      will result in swift punitive action. This includes but is not restricted
      to copying material from other students, lying, or plagiarizing from any
      source. See the Writing and Humanistic Studies' website section about
      Avoiding_Plagiarism, for clarification on what constitutes plagiarism.
      Any student found to have cheated or behaved unethically or dishonestly
      will be given a grade of F on the assignment involved and referred to the
      appropriate disciplinary committees within MIT for further action.
