Goals for Today  
•  Give you skills for finding research 
information for your main class pro�ect 
•  Increase your efficiency  
•  Describe Libraries' resources in the 
context of the research process  
•  In parallel to support from your 
professor/TAs

Research Process  
1 	 Select a topic and define your research 
question 
2 	 Scan the literature for previous work in 
your area 
3 	 Find evidence relevant to your economic 
question 
4  	 Analyze and process your information 
5 	 Write your paper

Select a Topic 
•  Get advice from your professor/TAs 
•  Scan the literature (articles and books� 
•  Identify data available 
•  Iterative process 
•  Sample Topics 
- Do interventions in developing countries in 
health status have a direct effect on economic 
performance of that country?  
- Brief exploration of pollution and power plants

Scan the Literature   
•  Gives the context for your argument; your 
paper is part of the larger cycle of economics 
literature and publication 
•  See what others have written on your topic 
•  Starting points for literature on a topic: 
- bibliographies  Handbooks in Economics  
Econlit  Journal of Economic Literature (JEL�  
review articles  and syllabi for graduate classes  
•  Role of working papers 
 
5 

56

Find Evidence  
•  Search the economics literature (articles  
books  and other formats� 
•  Define the kind of data needed 
•  Search for data 
- Statistics  
- Research datasets  
•  Interlibrary Borrowing/Suggest a Purchase

Who Might Collect Your Data 
•  Data is usually expensive and time� 
consuming to collect  store  and publish 
•  Consider: 
- Who has the time  resources  and authority to 
collect the data?  
- Who is responsible for collecting or managing 
the data?  
- Who has an interest in your topic?  
- Who is producer and how might that affect 
quality of the data?

Who has an incentive to  
collect data?  
•  Example: pharmaceutical patent expiration dates  
•	  Currently  active patents listed in the U S  FDA Electronic Orange Book  
- U S  FDA (Food and Drug Administration� collects this data for regulatory  purposes  
•	  But say  that you need to find a list of older  expired patents.  
- There exist old  annual paper copies of the US FDA Orange Book    
- Feasible to enter the data for prior years in order to observe now�expired 
patents.but not on the time horizon of 14 33  
•	  Who else would have an incentive to collect this data?  
- One answer: the Indian government  
- Goal is to encourage Indian generic pharmaceutical industry   
•	  Pharmexcil (http://pharmexcil org/ �   
- Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council  
- Set up by  Ministry  of Commerce & Industry   Govt  of India  
- Looking on their website turns up this list of patent expirations from 2005�2010:

Hunting for Data via Literature 

•  Useful technique: search  the literature for 
articles/books on your topic 
•  Examine their data sources and see if they  
can help to answer your research question   
•  Avail yourself of the work someone else 
already has done identifying data sources 
•  But how?

Example Case  
•	  Recent issue of American Economic Review 
•	  Muller  Nicholas Z ; Mendelsohn  Robert; Nordhaus 
William (August 2011�  Environmental Accounting for 
Pollution in the United States Economy. American
  
Economic Review  101  1�4�-1��5   
doi=10 125�/aer 101 5 1�4� 
•	  "This study presents a framework to include 
environmental externalities into a system of national 
accounts  The paper estimates the air pollution damages 
for each industry in the United States  "  
•	  Lots of data sources!

Data Citation Practices  
1  In reference list
