Session 3 

Leadership Lessons Learned and Observations Since Last Session: 
•  Supportive communications – ensuring people know they are supported in taking risks 
Importance of paraphrasing and active listening 
• 
Important lesson on cooperation – can now see game theory that underlies the bargaining 
•	
exercise we conducted – how results can be sub-optimal and how to change/improve by 
changing the rules of the game 
•  Not everyone can be the leader – importance of assessing skills in the group 
•  Sometimes the best way to lead is to get up and do it 
In an environment like TPP the approach to leadership makes more sense – not a clear 
•	
hierarchy structure 
In the context of campus life – you sometimes have to recognize the absence of leadership 
– there may not be guidance on a given project or activity 

• 

Analysis of Potential Leadership “Disconnects” Associated with Different Systems

o	 Taylorisim, Industrial Engineering and Work Redesign; Socio-Technical Systems 
Redesign; Worker Participation and the Human Relations Movement; Team-
Based Work Systems 
Key Leadership Disconnects: 
o	 Relating and enabling disconnects – form the groups, but don’t attend to the 
communications and other interactive issues or the enabling group support 
issues 
•  Relationship-Centered Systems Change Initiatives 
o	 Strategic Alliances; Joint Ventures; Labor-Management Partnerships; Customer-
Supplier Partnerships 
Key Leadership Disconnects: 
o  A domineering leadership style or someone self-centered in their approach 
•  Outcome-Centered Systems Change Initiatives 
o	 Quality Initiatives (Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, etc.); Lean Initiatives 
(Lean Manufacturing, Lean Enterprise, etc.); Knowledge Management 
Key Leadership Disconnects:

o	
Information Technology (Personal Computers in the Workplace, Enterprise 
Resource Planning Systems, e-business, etc.); Material and Method-Driven 
Transformations; Research and Development Commercialization 
Key Technology Disconnects: 
o	
Inability to adapt to rapid changes in context, markets, and technology and 
inattention to critical social/interactive issues, as well as lack of a shared vision 
•  Observations 

1


o  Relating issues cut across many 
o  Shared vision was highlighted most often 
o  All aspects of leadership are relevant each case 
o	 Different leadership styles are needed in the context of different change 
initiatives 
o  No one leader will drive all of these initiatives in a given organization 
o  Key challenges around balance and integration across systems change initiatives 

Coaching Advice for Cross Cultural Negotiations 

Culture A 
•  Group 1: 
o  Just because we are cooperative in approach, we don’t have to be weak 
o	 Write things down as we go – producing instant accomplishments and feedback 
for Culture B, and also creating a record 
•  Group 3: 
o	 Find a common enemy to create their desire for cooperation with A and to 
channel their competitive energy at the enemy 
o  Aim high – ask for more than we want so they can feel like they won 
•  Group 5: 
o  Provide some instant gratification 
o  Look for value that is important to us and not significant for them and vice/versa 
o  Establish back up consequences 

Culture B 
•  Group 2: 
o  Establish demands beyond what constituents want 
o  Take an open approach – set overall goals 
o  Be clear about what is important to us – look for gains to the other side 
•  Group 4: 
o  Look for consensus on short term issues 
o	 Let them focus on the long term – but look for ways to confuse them or find 
weaknesses on the long term 
•  Group 6: 
o  Short-term cooperation 
o	 Leave ambiguity on the long term – with potential for exploitation of this 
ambiguity for our advantage 

Additional Observations 
•  Each culture was taking a “band aide approach” – still holding to core assumptions 
•  Neither culture played to its own strengths 
•  Open about your own cultural assumptions 
•  Open to learning about others 
Identify middle ground or third culture options 
• 
•  Opportunity for leaders to innovate

Jim Hamilton -- Class of 1996 

Managing Director, Conservation Law Foundation 


Carlos A. Martinez-Vela – Class of 1998 

Ph.D. student, Technology Management Program, Engineering Systems Division  


Joseph Reagle – Class of 1996 

Policy Analyst, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  


John Weiss – Class of 1994 

Associate, Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 


Introductions 
Joseph – World Wide Web Consortium – HTML, XML, tags, etc. – technology and society 
•	
domain (content selection, censorship, privacy practices, encryption signature, etc.) 
o  Concerned that anything said on leadership might come across as trite 
•  John – Cambridge Energy Associates – environmental issues 
o  Notes from today’s class resonated 
o	 Leadership is not about throwing directives from on high – it is about 
collaboration – first among equals 
o 
Initiative is key – good leaders always thinking about how to do things better 
o  When people are surprised it is harder to move forward 
o	 Communications is key – not just speaking but also writing well – this is a 
premium in the world 
•  Carlos – TMP student – background from University of Monterey 
o	 Experience with Latin American student group on issues of sustainable 
development 
o  Studying innovation at Industrial Performance Center 
o  Experience with some truly great leaders 
o	 Comes back to your core conception of what it means to be a human being – 
contrast between the rational view (from the enlightenment) of individuals with 
stable preferences who have a clear understanding of means and ends (points to 
leadership focus on rewards and punishments) versus a more romantic view 
centered on the search for meaning (points to leadership focus on creating 
meaning through stories and other means) 
o  You have to be true to who you are – consistent with your personality and history 
– as suggested in the class materials 
o  Leadership is a moral act – it is about values 
o	
It should be enjoyable – but it is also about distancing yourself in order to have 
the bigger picture 
•  Jim – Engineering and environmental area 
o  Leadership is a function of who you are – you have to understand your 
o  Multiple stakeholders in this domain 
o	 Leadership is the inter-relationship between control and the number of people 
involved 
o	 As the number of people increases you have to follow the idea – to be a good 
leader you have to know how to be a good follower after a certain point 
o  A facilitating role – always walking on eggshells

o	 The word leadership is problematic – is conveys a false conception that you have 
the answers – the need to recognize that others will have key answers 
o 
It is fun to suggest ideas and see them grow – small “l” leadership 
Questions 
•  How do you balance technical expertise and being an effective leader? 
•  How do you find your own leadership style? 
•	 How do you deal with frustration – when you have your idea and it is not going as 
anticipated? 
•	 How to deal with people from other organizations – including people who know more than 
you, but you are still the leader? 
•  How to deal with people who are older than you – how to earn respect? 
•  What difference has TPP made in your career? 
Is it possible to be a leader and still be moderate?  Does leadership require you to be 
•	
extreme? 
•  How to link theoretical learning from TPP with past practical experience in new settings? 
•	 What is the best way to learn about leadership?  Is it through courses on leadership?  What 
about situations where there is a lack of leadership? 

•	

Discussion 
In a consensus based organization experience and years of experience may not be as 
•	
important 
•	 One key when you come up against age and status differences is by doing good work – and 
begin by being humble 
•	 Contrast between being the kitchen manager versus being the pastry chef versus being the 
food critic – some ability as a chef is important to the other roles, but that is not all of it 
•	 How much technical expertise do you need?  There is a base level of knowledge that you do 
need, but there is a premium place on the ability to do both 
Issues about people who are clearly on one side – limits in what you can do as an advocate 
versus as a more neutral broker 
•	 As an environmental advocacy organization – we stand for the trees, fish and people, but 
we also have a for-profit group that goes out and works with the very people we have sued – 
raising complex issues around selling out on our very reputation 
•  People are not smart or dumb – they just know differently 
•	 You are not in a position of leadership if you don’t feel the tension between advocacy and 
neutrality 
Issues of intellectual property – principled position is easier, but may not be leadership 
• 
•	 Contrast between moving out further on the see-saw versus moving the fulcrum – 
renegotiating the rules of the game 
•  See the relevance of context – the power of integration and being an honest broker 
•  The ability to see the world through the eyes of the other 
•  Leadership is not about control – it is about shaping and orchestrating 
•	 Consider the assumption that you want to be a leader – how much do you seek out 
leadership roles? 
Lessons from TPP – the idea of focusing on interests rather than positions has been with 
me – especially in the business of establishing standards on the internet 
•	 Consensus context forces dialogue and sharing – including agreement on vocabulary and 
surfacing interests – in contrast to organization the uses Robert’s rules of order, which 
drives focus on stacking committees and winning on votes

•  Value of TPP pro-seminars with applied problems such as internet access to public schools 
– which ended up being translated into action – more than the technology, but also the 
econometric analysis, contractual relationships, and governmental officials 
•	 TPP helped me to speak several languages – technical, social, ethical – this is an important 
thing that you take out into the world 
•  At MIT the world becomes a small place – many things become possible 
•	 TPP becomes part of who you are – it is not any one specific thought that leads to a specific 
ability – it is a whole approach to things that you take away 
•	 The ability to focus on what you know well and not pretending to know more than that (Here 
is what I know:  2+2=4, you can’t push on a rope and water doesn’t flow up hill) 
•	 Assume that you can’t steer people – they are their own ships and you can just offer 
guidance 
•	 Being transparent about yourself and your expertise – my work style is listed on a web-site, 
which is an extreme, but that is helpful for me 
•	 Don’t assume that people who act knowledgeable know more than you – the power of 
probing questions 
•	 Know what you know, know what you don’t know, and be prepared for people who will try to 
snow you or who do not share your standards of morality 
If you are just starting out, how do get off being humble and saying “I don’t know” 
• 
•	 Results do matter – humility is not just a façade – it is a way of interacting that can deliver 
better results 
In case between multi-phase and asynchronous protocol – everyone assumed they were 
different until the simple question was asked 
•	 Beyond “I don’t know” take on the opportunity to find the answer – chances are it will be 
useful more than in that instance 
•  Most contexts provide countless opportunities to become expert – a key is choosing wisely 
•  There is a responsibility – such as working on the liberalization of energy markets in Bolivia 
– you have to reflect on your responsibilities 
In field work on innovation in Finland – people assume that your coming from MIT makes 
you an expert, which involves responsibility 

•

Integrating Observations 
•  Communications and integrity 
•  Flexible and understanding – seeing other view point 
•  Delicate task – leadership is hard 
•  Confidence in your self – being responsible 
•  Leadership is not just for leaders – it is for all human beings 
•  Excellence – being the best you can 

Concluding Comments 
I am learning today – this is a continuous process 
• 
•  Thank you for your help in my learning 
I began not being trite, but will say that being a leader involves helping people to value what 
•	
you want to do 
•  Thanks – this has been good learning 
•  Taking time to reflect is important – and time to practice – the reflective practitioner 
•  The importance of being attentive to your self, the signals from the work and from others 
Leadership is the reflection of you out in the world – your style at a given point in your life 
•	
and your career
