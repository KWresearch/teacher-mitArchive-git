Key Leadership Ideas Revisited 
Key Leadership Ideas Revisited

  Leadership is about change and implementation: catalyzing action. 

	 Leadership is an ongoing process involving a set of individuals taking on
a variety of tasks and working  interdependently.  It is not a position or a
single person. 

	 Leadership is contingent: to be an effective leader you need to be able to
map the context and the culture and work with an understanding of what
is enabled and what is constrained. 

	 There is no one-way to be a leader.  You must understand yourself and
find a style and mode of change—your change signature—that fit your
values, competencies, and influence style. 

	 When you appear on the front page of a major newspaper we want to be
proud of what we read.  We want our students to act with integrity and 
courage.

Analysis of Alternative Assumptions 
Analysis of Alternative Assumptions

  Process: 
  Six groups of about 6-7 people each 
  Two highly simplified sets of assumptions are listed on the 
next page -- reflecting two hypothetical cultures 
  Three groups operate as a cluster under one set of
assumptions and three as a cluster under the other 
  One group from each cluster will be assigned each of the
following: 
  How to prepare for and open negotiations? 
  How to manage internal differences during negotiations? 
  How to conclude negotiations and live under/with agreements? 
  You will be given a blank transparency to draw a picture or
otherwise convey what your phase of negotiations would be
like with other organizations in your culture -- given these 
assumptions

Assumptions in culture A: 

Assumptions in culture B: 
The most important outcomes of a 
negotiations are the specific 
agreements reached 
The primary goal of a negotiator is 
to effectively represent 
constituents/clients 
Consensus within your side is 
critical, divisions within the other 
side can be advantageous 
Fairness should be judged based 
on clear and consistent 
standards 
Conflicts are contests to be won 
Competition is essential to drive 
excellence 

The most important outcomes of a

implications 
The primary goal of a negotiator is 
to build and maintain an 
enduring relationship 
Consensus within the other side is 
as important as consensus 
within your side 
Fairness should be judged on a 
case-by-case basis, taking in 
account special circumstances 
Conflicts are problems to be 
solved 
Cooperation is essential to 
optimize the whole

Analysis of Alternative Assumptions 
Analysis of Alternative Assumptions

  How do these assumptions govern negotiations among  

people within the same culture? 
  What might happen if people from the two different 
cultures were to bargain with each other? 
  These are highly stylized sets of assumptions -- how 
do they line up with assumptions about negotiations in 
cultures with which you are familiar? 
  What experiences have you with with contrasting 
cultural assumptions about negotiations? 
  What have we learned during this exercise?

Selected Lessons About 
Selected Lessons About
Cross-Cultural Negotiations 
Cross-Cultural Negotiations
	 Anticipate divergent assumptions about time horizons,
relationships, substantive agreements, internal
consensus, conflict and cooperation 
  Approach negotiations with an empathic, learning
stance 
  Assess when to adopt local practices (such as norms
about time) and when to maintain your style/approach
(such as levels of disclosure) -- and communicate 
these choices 
  Attend to the logistics of translation and interpretation 
  Assume there will be misunderstandings -- be humble 
about what you know or be humbled by what you don’t
know
