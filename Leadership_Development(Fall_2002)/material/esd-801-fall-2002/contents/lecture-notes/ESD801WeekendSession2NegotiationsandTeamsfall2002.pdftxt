Common negotiations situations

  In small groups: 
	  Identify common negotiations situations that you 
might encounter on the job 

  As a full group: 
	  List 5-7 examples of common negotiations 
situations

Traditional negotiations 
Traditional negotiations
•  Overstate your opening position 
•  Always have a fall-back position 
Commit to your position early and publicly
• 

• 
If you are a group, always use a single spokesperson 
•  Give as little as possible for what you get 
•  Never bargain against yourself 
•  Mobilize support from your constituents 
•  Exploit weaknesses in the other side 
•  An agreement reluctantly accepted is a sign of success

based communications 
Interested
Here are two statements -- which is positional and
which is interest-based? 

Statement A:  We are implementing a new quality initiative and we
expect that this Work Group will fully participate 

Statement B:  We are implementing a new quality initiative, which is
part of ISO 9000:2000.  We know that Work Groups are essential to
any quality initiative – so we really want your full participation.
Also, active Work Group participation in ISO 9000:2000 will send an 
important signal to our customers.  What can we do to work 
together on this issue? 

What do you notice when you compare the statements?

Checking the message
Checking the message
  Step 1:  Agree to check the message 
  Step 2:  Reflect what was heard 
  Step 3:  Ask if accurate 
– If yes, proceed

– If no, ask again 


	 Exercise:  Turn to your neighbor.  State your hopes or 
fears about an upcoming negotiation.  The neighbor 
follows the three steps.  Reverse roles.

Simulation ground rules
	 Take your role seriously

  From now on, during the simulation, this is who you are 

	 Support others as they play their role 
	 Recognize that this is easier for some than others and that 
people may be experimenting with new skills or approaches 

	 You may invent additional, consistent information 
	 Provided, of course, that it doesn’t give you an unfair advantage 
If you finish any phase early, use the remaining time to 
debrief with your partner

Lessons from the simulation
Lessons from the simulation
	 Prepare (assess interests) to avoid positional 
bargaining 
	 Build on interests (yours/others) to generate 
options 
	 Create value through information exchange 
	 Don’t “cut a deal” too soon -- you may cut off 
better options

Role of a Facilitator
Role of a Facilitator
  Establish group process and your role 
  Problem solving model; Process improvement model;  Process 
mapping process;  Strategic planning process; Learning
dialogue; etc. 
  Clarify desired outcome, time boundaries, resources and
other considerations 
  Monitor time/progress with group process 
  Surface underlying interests – avoid positional traps 
  Ensure balanced contributions 
  Carefully distinguish your contributions on substance from
your process role 
  Use flip charts or other visual display tools as appropriate 
  Mediate disputes where appropriate 
  Challenge/error proof superficial agreements 
  Adjust role with increased group capability 
  Appreciate all contributions and collective effort

Brainstorming skills
Brainstorming skills
	 Definition: 
	 A process for generating new ideas by drawing on collective wisdom 
and synergy in a group 
	 Logistics: 
Identify a recorder and facilitator (can be the same person) 
 
  Clarify the issue or question 
If appropriate, first generate ideas individually on paper 
 
  Cluster before you prioritize (which is part of phase IV – focusing) 
	 Process: 
  Begin recording ideas from the group -- sequentially or otherwise 
  Encourage “piggy-backing” and “wild or crazy” ideas 
  Discourage criticism or judgmental comments 
  Push past “the pause”

Brainstorming Exercise
Brainstorming Exercise
	 Your research organization that has been asked to identify
potential high-leverage options in order to evaluate the impact of
the Kyoto Treaty 
	 Note:  The Kyoto Treaty involves an agreement among 26
industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Less 
industrialized nations have not reached specific agreements on target
levels, but have agreed to make progress towards that capability.
Importantly, the United States chose not to sign this Treaty even
though virtually all other major industrialized nations didso. 
Individually list your ideas about high leverage research strategies
to assess the impact of the Kyoto Treaty 
  Select what you consider to be your two best ideas 
  Form small groups of 4-5 people 
  Rotate each member of the group in the facilitator / recorder role,
collecting ideas from the group 
	 The goal is to generate the maximum number of options 
	 Use “dots” to prioritize the ideas – be prepared to report out on your
top priority items

Dealing With Difficult People
Dealing With Difficult People
	 Lessons from “Getting Past No – Negotiating Your Way from
Confrontation to Cooperation” by William Ury (Bantam, 1991): 
 Don’t React:  Go to the Balcony 
 Don’t Argue: 
Step to Their Side 
 Don’t Reject:  Reframe 
 Don’t Push: 
Build a Golden Bridge 
 Don’t Escalate:  Use Power to Educate

Dealing With Difficult People
Dealing With Difficult People
Planned confrontations:


	 Planned confrontations – you know you have a difficult issue coming up 

  Plan a statement that does three things: 
  1.  Describe what is occurring – the problem 
  2.  Note how it affects you -- Your interests/concerns 
  3.  Identify the consequences 

	 This is sometimes referred to as the opposite of a “you” message that just
accuses people – an “I” message that includes your own interests or 
concerns 

	 Think through an upcoming confrontation and note all three elements on 
a piece of paper. 
	 What would happen if you left any one element out?

Dealing with Difficult People
Dealing with Difficult People
Unplanned confrontations:


	 You are suddenly in a difficult situation where you have a difficult
message to deliver 

	 Avoid the trap of delivering an accusatory “you” message – “you did this. .
.” “How could you . . .” 

	 Alternative approach: 
  Sort out the facts – assess who is involved and what is at stake 
  Anticipate active listening before delivering the confrontation – to fully
understand what is at stake and to open up communication

  Then delivery all three elements of the message: 

1.  Describe what is occurring – the problem 
2.  Note how it affects you –Your interests/concerns – “I am in a 
bind here. . .”  “I feel . . .” 
3.  Identify the consequences 

  What are examples on unplanned confrontations you have had to deliver?
