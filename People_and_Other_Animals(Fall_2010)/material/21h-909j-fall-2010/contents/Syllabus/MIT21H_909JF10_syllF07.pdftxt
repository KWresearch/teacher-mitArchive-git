Prof. H. Ritvo 

Subject Description 
A historical survey of the ways that people have interacted with their closest animal relatives, for 
example: hunting, domestication of livestock, exploitation of animal labor, scientific study of 
animals, display of exotic and performing animals, and pet keeping. Themes include changing 
ideas about animal agency and intelligence, our moral obligations to animals, and the limits 
imposed on the use of animals.  

Readings 

The following books are available for purchase at the MIT bookstore or from various online 

vendors: 


Sarah Franklin, Dolly Mixtures (Duke University Press) 

Anita Guerrini, Experimenting with Humans and Animals (Johns Hopkins University Press) 

Vicki Hearne, Adam’s Task (Skyhorse Publishing) 

Harriet Ritvo, The Animal Estate (Harvard University Press) 

Anna Sewell, Black Beauty (Signet) 

Noelie Vialles, Animal to Edible (Cambridge University Press) 

H. G. Wells, The Island of Doctor Moreau (Penguin) 

Other readings can be accessed via the class website. 

Required readings for everyone are listed on the schedule below.  Additional required readings 
for graduate students are listed on a separate schedule.  (Of course, undergraduates are very 
 
welcome to read them too.)   Suggestions for supplementary reading, as well as related websites, 
are listed on the class website. 

Written Assignments 

A research paper will be due at the end of the semester—12 pages for undergraduates, 25 pages 
for graduate students.  A proposal, bibliography, and progress report will be due as indicated in 
the schedule.  I will be happy to read and comment on drafts if they are submitted at least two 
weeks before the final paper is due. 

In addition, each week students will hand in a brief (1-2 pages) response to the readings. 

Non-written Assignments 

Although most of the readings are historical, the issues they deal with are also contemporary.  
Therefore, on most weeks one student will introduce the class by linking its theme to current (or 
recent) events, institutions, and practices.  Also, there will be no class on September 25.  During 
 
that week each student will visit a local animal-related institution, and will report on that visit in 
writing and in class on October 2. 

Students will give a brief oral report on the progress of their research on November 20 and a 15 ­
minute presentation on December 11.

Things to Remember 

Written assignments should represent original and individual work.  For a detailed discussion of 
what this means, see  the “Academic Integrity at MIT” handbook, available online at:  
http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/ 

Assignments are to be handed in on time.  If an extension becomes necessary it should be 
requested ahead of the due date.  Otherwise, lateness will be penalized. 

Attendance is important.  Not all the material to be covered in class is included in the readings.  
Be sure to bring your copy of  the readings to discussion classes. 

Grading will be based on the three written assignments, the oral presentation, and class 
participation (including informal reflections), weighted as follows:  research paper 1/2; oral 
presentation--1/6; class participation (including informal response papers)--1/3.
