***** Description *****
A historical survey of the ways that people have interacted with their closest
animal relatives, for example: hunting, domestication of livestock,
exploitation of animal labor, scientific study of animals, display of exotic
and performing animals, and pet keeping. Themes include changing ideas about
animal agency and intelligence, our moral obligations to animals, and the
limits imposed on the use of animals.

related Web sites are listed on the Related_Resources page.
***** Written Assignments *****
A research paper will be due at the end of the semesterâ12 pages for
undergraduates, 25 pages for graduate students. A proposal will be due in Week
4. An annotated bibliography is due in Week 8. I will be happy to read and
comment on drafts if they are submitted at least two weeks before the final
paper is due. For inspiration, some topics students chose in Fall 2010 are
provided:
    * Taming Tsavo: Lions, Laborers, and the Lunatic Line
    * Portraits of Nature: The Parlor Aquarium and the Interiorization of
      Victorian Life
    * Resurrecting the Pleistocene
    * Marshall Hall and the Creation of a Painless Animal
    * The Human Ideology of Domestication: Creating Dogs for Specific Functions
    * The Furor Over Fur
In addition, each week students will hand in a brief (1-2 pages) response to
the readings.
***** Non-Written Assignments *****
Students will give a brief oral report on the progress of their research in
Week 8 and a 15-minute presentation in class during Week 13.
***** Grading *****
Grading will be based on the three written assignments, the oral presentation,
and class participation (including informal reflection/response papers),
weighted as follows:
       Grading Criteria.
ACTIVITIES          DISTRIBUTION
Research Paper      1/2
Oral Presentation   1/6
Class Participation 1/3
***** Things to Remember *****
Written assignments should represent original and individual work.
Assignments are to be handed in on time. If an extension becomes necessary it
should be requested ahead of the due date. Otherwise, lateness will be
penalized.
Attendance is important. Not all the material to be covered in class is
included in the readings. Be sure to bring your copy of the readings to class.
