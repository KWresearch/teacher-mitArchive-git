Things to think about:  Domestication 

 
Reading: Orlans, “Turbo-Cows.” 
 
Why does Orlans resist the tendency to understand the “high-yield” cow as a product of 
scientific research?  What alternative does she suggest? 
 
Does it make a difference that her research is based in Germany and Switzerland?  How 
does her interpretation of the development of modern breeds compare with interpretations 
based in Britain or the US?  How generalizable is her argument? 
 
What does Orlans suggest about the relation between milk production and the 
environment in which the cows live?   Why were Swiss and German dairy farmers 
disappointed with breeds imported from elsewhere in the 19th century? 
 
What relation does Orlans suggest between the rationalization of livestock breeding and 
the emergence of centralized state bureaucracy? 
 
Does Orlans’ discussion consistently support her assertion that breeds are a cultural 
construct? 
 
Reading: Pemberton, “Canine Technologies, Model Patients.” 
 
What relation does breeding for the laboratory have to livestock breeding?  Is there a 
difference sense with regard to the creation of something novel? 
 
What is a “model organism” and what does it imply about the relationship between 
people and other animals? 
 
Are the ethical issues raise by the production and use of hemophiliac dogs different from 
those raised by the production and use of super-producing dairy cows? 
 
Reading: Franklin, Dolly Mixtures, Chapters 2 and 3 
 
What connection does Franklin draw between livestock and profit? 
 
How can Dolly be understood as a product of both cutting edge modern science and 
traditional agricultural practices? 
 
What role does nationalism play in Franklin’s account? 
 
How does Franklin explain the diversity of British sheep (that is, the number of 
recognizable breeds)? 
 
Why does she think that the long history of sheep in Britain is essential to understanding 
Dolly’s significance? 

 
What were the economic consequences of the new notions about breeding that emerged 
in the 18th century? 
 
What was the relationship between quality (in terms of breed standards) and fertility in 
establishing valuable strains or breeds of livestock? 
 
How did early breeders deal with biological limitations on their manipulation of animal 
bodies? 
 
What does Franklin think that Dolly represented?  What do you think that she 
represented?
