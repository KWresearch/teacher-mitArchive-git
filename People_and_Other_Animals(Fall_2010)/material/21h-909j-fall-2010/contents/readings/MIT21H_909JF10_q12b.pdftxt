Why does the story begin in the East Indies? 

What are the original motivations (on either side) for the relationship between Captain Van Toch

What are the default assumptions through which Europeans try to assess and classify these alien  

yet useful and intelligent beings? 


What are the consequences of the relative vulnerability of people, and the relative invulnerability 
of the newts, to the profit motive? 

What can we deduce about English culture from Andy Scheuchzer's proficiency and style in 
learning the English language? 


How helpful is scientific nomenclature in understanding the newts? 


What is the relation between the reaction of scientists to the increasing populations of newts, and  

the reaction of the general public?


How does the Salamander Syndicate conceive of the newts?

environmental consequences?  Are these two kinds of consequences related? 


How do the heads of European nations balance the claims of military competition with those of

environmental preservation? 


What is the ladder of civilization and how do the newts ascend it? 


What does Capek think about the value of western culture?  Is it more accurately and 

dynamically represented by the behavior of people or of newts?
