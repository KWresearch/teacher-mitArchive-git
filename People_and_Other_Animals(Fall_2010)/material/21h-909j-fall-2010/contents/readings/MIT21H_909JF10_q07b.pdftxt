Things to think about: Black Beauty  
(page numbers refer to the Signet edition) 

 
What is the effect of having the horse be the main narrative voice, as well as the protagonist? 
 
How is the term “master” used throughout the book? Is it always the same? What is the 
difference between a good master and a bad master? How significant is it? 
 
The term “master” carries overtones of human slavery, as well as less extreme human social 
relations. Is Sewell suggesting a comparison between the condition of animals like horses and 
human slaves? Human workers? What is BB’s attitude toward being broken in as a colt, and 
toward the various kinds of work he subsequently performs? 
 
Class is an important dimension of many of the relationships and episodes in BB. How would 
you characterize Sewell’s attitudes toward the various human classes? How does she apply the 
class system to horses? Would you call Sewell a snob? 
 
What does Sewell (or BB) think of fox-hunting?  (6-8) 
 
To what does Sewell normally attribute bad behavior in horses? 
 
What is wrong with the bearing rein? (29, 86ff) with tail docking? (37) with docking the ears and 
tails of dogs? (38-39) 
 
What are the implications of Sewell’s comparisons of horses and machines? (34, 115) 
 
How would you characterize the religious basis of the philosophy of kindness (or the critique of 
cruelty) set forth in BB? 
 
What is the meaning of the assertion that “horses have no relations”? (20) 
 
What is the significance of BB’s constant name changes? 
 
How are anti-cruelty standards enforced in this novel (to the extent that they are enforced)? (164) 
 
To what extent does Sewell blame cab drivers for their (generally) harsh treatment of their 
horses? (165-8)
