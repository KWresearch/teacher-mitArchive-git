Things to think about: Vialles, Animal to Edible 

How is the perspective of an anthropologist different from that of a historian? 

Do the expectations of an originally Francophone academic audience seem different from those 
of an Anglophone academic audience?


What, if any, impact does the fact that it is based on one region of provincial France have on the 

general applicability of the conclusions of this study?


What are the basic cultural connotations of slaughtering?  Why did Vialles choose the initial 

quotation from Utopia Thomas More?


Why does Vialles begin with an attempt to define “meat” (3-7)?  How does she define it?  Is her 

definition satisfactory?


What is the difference between “meat” and “butcher’s meat” (13)?  Why is terminology so  

important in her analysis throughout the book (see, for example, 22-26, 46-51, 56-57. 87-90, 

129-30)?


What is the difference between butchering and slaughtering?  Why is their dissociation  

significant? 


What are the consequences of the industrialization of slaughtering?  What distinguishes 
industrial slaughtering from craft slaughtering (from the perspective of both human and non-
human participants)? 

Why does Vialles suggest that craft butchering is of relatively recent (that is, eighteenth century) 
origin (71-72)?


How does the design of abattoirs reinforce their symbolic meaning as well as their practical 

function?


What does Vialles mean by “de-animalisation”?  Do you agree that the slaughtering process 

makes butcher’s meat approach the condition of a vegetable?


Why does Vialles ask who actually does the killing (45)? 


Why does Vialles inject the perspective of a visitor to an abattoir at the beginning of chapter 3? 


What is the purpose of “flowering” a carcass (58ff)?


The abattoirs Vialles studied did not do halal or kosher slaughtering.  Would the inclusion of 

abattoirs that accommodated these practices have altered her analysis? 


What is the symbolic significance of blood, as opposed to meat?  Why is the smell of blood so 

important?


Why does Vialles devote so much attention to the tools and machines involved in the 

slaughtering process? 


How does Vialles establish the set of dichotomies that define which animals are appropriate for 

eating (113ff)?


On the basis of Vialles’ evidence, how humane is modern industrial slaughtering?


What relation does Vialles suggest between edibility and sexuality (129-132)?
