HASS-D 
The World Since 1492 
MW 2.30-4 
Fall 2008 

Dr. Bedross Der Matossian 

Description

The course deals with five hundred years of world history, beginning from 1492 until the 
present.  Rather  than  trying  to  do  a  chronological  survey  of  all  the  events  and  processes 
that shaped the last five hundred years of global history, the course will focus on specific 
geographic  regions  and  key  related  themes  and  processes  that  had  enormous  impact  in 
shaping our contemporary world.  

To  reach  this  aim,  the  class will  focus  on  several  central  themes.  These  include  political 
and  social 
transformation; 
the  global  formation  of  capitalist  economies  and 
industrialization;  colonialism  and  imperialism;  nationalism;  the  emergence  of  modern
states;  and  the  rise  of  consumer  society. While  any  of  these  themes  could  serve  the 
subject  for  an  entire  semester,  we  will  discuss  them  in  conjunction  with  each  other  and
the  ways  in  which  they  interact.  In  addition,  the  class  will  be  based  on  various  types  of 
readings ranging from primary sources, historical narratives, and historiography, to works 
of  fiction  and movies. This  is  intended  to  familiarize  students with  the  craft  of  historical 
work and the process of creating historiography. 

Finally,  the  class  is  aimed  at  developing  the  tools  that  students  need  in  order  to 
understand,  analyze,  and  critically  perceive  history  and  historiography,  not  only  to 
understand the past but also to better understand the contemporary world.   

Course Organization  

The  format  of  the  class will  be  lectures  on Mondays  and Wednesdays. The  regular  class 
meetings  will  be  composed  of  lecture,  question  and  answer  and  brief  discussion  of  the 
material.  All  students  must  demonstrate  that  they  have  read  and  critically  analyzed  the 
material in preparation for lectures and class discussions. Therefore, participation in class
is  a  very  important  part  of  the  course,  as  is  reflected  in  the  breakdown  of  the  final  grade 
as follows:  

Four 5-page papers: 15% each  
Discussion/Participation: 20% Final  
Exam: 20%

 

[1] 

Participation: 

This  component  of  the  grade  includes  mandatory  attendance  of  all  lecture  classes  and
active  participation  in  the  classes.  Failure  to  do  so  will  result  in  a  deduction  from  your 
final grade. From time to time students will be asked to facilitate a discussion session.   

Written assignments  

Essays:  In  addition  to  the  discussion  session,  the  criteria  for  HASS-D  subjects  include 
twenty pages of written assignments during  the  semester. These will be divided  into  four
papers  that  will  draw  on  the  assigned  readings,  lectures,  discussion,  and  movies  from 
class. There will be no need  for  additional outside  research. The  four –5-page papers  are
due on  September 29, October 27, November 19, and December 10.  

Film Project: Students will be required to write one of the four 5-page papers on movies.
In  this  paper  students  are  required  to  compare  2-3  films  [see  film  series  below]  and
evaluate  the  extent  to  which  they  reflect  the  historical  transformations  that  took  place 
during the period that they cover. .  

Final  Examination:  The  final  exam  will  take  place  during  finals’  week  and  it  will 
encompass  the  entire  semester’s  work.  The  final  exam  will  include  a  map,  key  terms, 
short  essays,  and  a  long  essay  question.  All  of  the  sections  mentioned  in  the  final  exam
will have some element of choice. 

Academic  Honesty:  The  work  that  you  submit  for  this  class  must  be  your  own  work. 
Plagiarism of  any kind will not be  tolerated under  any  circumstance  and will  result  in  an 
immediate  “F”  grade  for  the  course.  In  addition,  all  such  cases  will  be  immediately 
directed  to  the  Committee  of  Discipline.  Any  words  and  ideas  that  are  not  yours  should 
be  accompanied  by  full  and  complete  citation.  If  you  have  any  further  questions  dealing 
with  academic  honesty  you  must  contact  the  professor  prior  to  the  submission  of  any 
written assignment.
