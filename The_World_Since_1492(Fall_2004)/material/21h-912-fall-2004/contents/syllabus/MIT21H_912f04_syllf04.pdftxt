THE WORLD SINCE 1492 

This class offers a look into the last five hundred years of world history.  Rather than 
attempt an exhaustive chronology of everything that has occurred on the globe since 1492—an 
impossible task for a lifetime, let alone a single semester—we will be focusing on certain 
geographic areas at specific times, in order to highlight a particular historical problem or to 
examine the roots of processes that have had an enormous impact on the contemporary world.  
In order to lend structure to such a wide-ranging exploration, the class will orient around 
four central themes:  Colonialism and imperialism;  political and social revolution;  
industrialization; and the rise of consumer society.  While any of these themes could provide the 
basis for a class in-and-of itself, we will look to the ways in which these themes interact—for 
example, how the history of imperialism relates to the course of industrialization.  Finally, in this 
class we will engage with a range of different types of readings, from primary sources (writings 
from the times), to historical narratives, to historiography (debates about history), to works of 
fiction.  In this way, the class will also allow a glimpse into the ways in which history itself is 
constructed and continually re-written. 
 
Organization of the Class: 
 
In general, we will have an intensive discussion session every week addressing a specific book or 
group of essays.  Other class meetings, meanwhile, will be a blend of informal lecture, question 
and answer, and discussion.   Discussions will therefore be the single most significant element of 
this class.  This is reflected in the calculation of the final grade, which can be broken down as 
follows: 
 
Four 5-page papers:                15% each 
Discussion/Participation:     25% 
Final Exam:     
        
15% 
 
There may be short (1 or 2 page) written responses to the readings assigned intermittently; these 
will be factored into the discussion grade. 
 
In addition to discussion, the criteria for a HASS-D subject include twenty pages of written 
assignments.  These papers will draw from the assigned readings, lectures, and discussions over 
the course of the class:  no additional or outside research will be required for the papers.  The 
four 5-page papers are due Oct. 4, Oct. 25, Nov. 10 and Dec. 1.   
You can revise and resubmit at least one of these papers.  Please talk to me first before rewriting 
a paper; revisions must be returned, along with the marked original and comments, within two 
weeks of receiving the corrected original.
