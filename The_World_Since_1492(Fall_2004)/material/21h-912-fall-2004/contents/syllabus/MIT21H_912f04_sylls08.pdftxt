Description: 

Instructor:  David Ciarlo 

THE WORLD SINCE 1492 

This class offers a look into the last five hundred years of world history.  Rather than 
attempt an exhaustive chronology of all of the significant events and processes that have 
occurred on the globe since 1492—an impossible task for a lifetime, let alone a single 
semester—we will be focusing on certain geographic areas at specific times, in order to highlight 
a particular historical problem or to examine the roots of processes that have had an enormous 
impact on the contemporary world. 
In order to lend structure to such a wide-ranging exploration, the class will orient around 
several central themes:  colonialism and imperialism;  political and social transformations; 
industrialization; nationalism; and the rise of consumer society.  While any of these themes could 
provide the basis for a class in-and-of itself, we will look to the ways in which these themes 
interact—for example, how the history of imperialism relates to the course of industrialization. 
Finally, in this class we will engage with a range of different types of readings, from primary 
sources (writings from the times), to historical narratives, to historiography (debates about 
history), to works of fiction.  In this way, the class will also allow a glimpse into the ways in 
which history itself is constructed and continually re-written. 

Organization of the Class: 

In general, we will have an intensive discussion session every week addressing a specific book or 
group of essays.  Other class meetings, meanwhile, will be a blend of informal lecture, question 
and answer, and discussion.   Discussions will therefore be the single most significant element of 
this class.  This is reflected in the calculation of the final grade, which can be broken down as 
follows: 

Four 5-page papers: 
Discussion/Participation: 
Final Exam: 

15% each 
25% 
15% 

In addition to discussion, the criteria for a HASS-D subject include twenty pages of written 
assignments.  These papers will draw from the assigned readings, lectures, and discussions over 
the course of the class:  no additional or outside research will be required for the papers.  The 
four 5-page papers are due March 10, April 2, April 23 and May 7. 

You must revise and resubmit at least one of these papers.  Please talk to me first before 
rewriting a paper; revisions must be returned, along with the marked original and comments, 
within two weeks of receiving the corrected original.

Please note:  Plagiarism of any kind—that is taking another's words and/or ideas from a book, 
another student, or from the internet without full and complete citation—will not be tolerated 
regardless of the circumstances, and will result in an "F" for the final class grade.
