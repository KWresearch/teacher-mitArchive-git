***** Description *****
This class offers a look into the last five hundred years of world history.
Rather than attempt an exhaustive chronology of everything that has occurred on
the globe since 1492 - an impossible task for a lifetime, let alone a single
semester - we will be focusing on certain geographic areas at specific times,
in order to highlight a particular historical problem or to examine the roots
of processes that have had an enormous impact on the contemporary world.
In order to lend structure to such a wide-ranging exploration, the class will
orient around four central themes: Colonialism and imperialism; political and
social revolution; industrialization; and the rise of consumer society. While
any of these themes could provide the basis for a class in-and-of itself, we
will look to the ways in which these themes interact - for example, how the
history of imperialism relates to the course of industrialization. Finally, in
this class we will engage with a range of different types of readings, from
primary sources (writings from the times), to historical narratives, to
historiography (debates about history), to works of fiction. In this way, the
class will also allow a glimpse into the ways in which history itself is
constructed and continually re-written.
***** Organization of the Class *****
In general, we will have an intensive discussion session every week addressing
a specific book or group of essays. Other class meetings, meanwhile, will be a
blend of informal lecture, question and answer, and discussion. Discussions
will therefore be the single most significant element of this class. This is
reflected in the calculation of the final grade, which can be broken down as
follows:
           Grading Table
Activities               PERCENTAGES
Four 5-page Papers       15% each
Discussion/Participation 25%
Final Exam               15%
There may be short (1 or 2 page) written responses to the readings assigned
intermittently; these will be factored into the discussion grade.
In addition to discussion, the criteria for a HASS-D subject include twenty
pages of written assignments. These papers will draw from the assigned
readings, lectures, and discussions over the course of the class: no additional
or outside research will be required for the papers. The four 5-page papers are
due onÂ Sessions 7, 14,Â 20 and 25.
You can revise and resubmit at least one of these papers. Please talk to me
first before rewriting a paper; revisions must be returned, along with the
marked original and comments, within two weeks of receiving the corrected
original.
Please note: Plagiarism of any kind - that is taking another's words and/or
ideas from a book, another student, or from the internet without full and
complete citation - will not be tolerated regardless of the circumstances, and
will result in an "F" for the final class grade.
