***** Course Description *****
This subject explores the varied nature and practice of computation in design.
We will view computation and design broadly. Computation will include both work
done on the computer (digital computing) and by-hand. Design will include both
the process of making designs and artifacts, as well as the designs and
artifacts themselves. The aim of the course is to develop a view of computation
and design beyond the specifics of techniques and tools, and a critical, self-
awareness of our own approaches and metaphors for computation and design.
