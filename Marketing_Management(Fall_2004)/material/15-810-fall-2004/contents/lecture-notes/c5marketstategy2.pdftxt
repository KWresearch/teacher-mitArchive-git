Marketing Strategy:  
Deciding Which Markets to Target

Overview

Which markets are most attractive
1. Market size
2. Horizontal competition
3. Vertical competition

What do you control?

3. Vertical Competition

Why is it important that your suppliers and distributors 
face competition?

– Share profits

– Fighting over shares reduces total profits (double 
marginalization)

Examples of Double Marginalization 

Components Monopolist component manufacturer 
owned by your competitor

Manufacturers Ignore the impact on suppliers of 
refusing to adopt their new products.

Distributors

“Recently we lost a deal because our 
distributor would not cut margins.”

Dealers

“More extensive dealer coverage 
contributes to a lower street price.”

Key Bargaining Questions

With Suppliers
Will customers buy your product without this supplier’s 
component?

With Retailers & Distributors
Will customers leave the store if they don’t see your 
product?

What Do You Control?

Market size

Do not demonstrate your own profitability (Snapple)
Protect weak competitors (Bausch and Lomb)

Vertical Competition

Cooperate and divide up the profits
Vertically integrate
