The Customer Decision Process

The Customer Decision Process

1.  Collect information about the alternatives

2.  Form expectations

3.  Make purchasing decision

1.  Collect Information

Trade off cost and benefit of searching
– importance of decision: car, house 
– cost of search: taxis
– firms can control the cost and benefit of search: dentists

Relationship between prior expertise and extent of search

Distortions While Searching

Selective attention
– people are more likely to notice stimuli that they 
anticipate

Selective distortion
– people interpret information in a manner that supports 
their prior beliefs

Selective retention
– people retain information that supports their beliefs

2.  Form Expectations

Customers infer quality from observable features
– brands
– exterior of cars
– restaurant parking lots
– Ferrari sponsoring Formula 1

Customers infer price from the price of other products
– tennis balls
– soda

3.  Purchasing Decision

Customers are generally required to trade off attributes

Firms would like to predict customers’ trade-off

Two problems:
– Measuring how customers make trade-offs
– The trade-offs are not stable

Measuring How Customers Make 
Trade-Offs

How will customers trade-off different product features:
– Do they prefer fuel efficiency to horsepower?
– Is ease of parking more important than luggage 
capacity?

Why not just ask customers?

What is Conjoint Analysis?

Widely used

Reveals how customers trade-off different product 
attributes

Presents customers with complete product profiles

Trade-Offs Are Not Stable

Examples:

endowment effect
adding a dominated alternative
focussing attention
mental accounts
transaction utility
credit card logos
adding unneeded options

Reconcile departures from the utility maximization model

Endowment Effect

Mug Experiment (2000)

Spring
Average purchasing price: $3.37

Average selling price:

$10.87

Fall
$2.62

$9.62

Adding A Dominated Alternative

The  tendency  to  prefer  X  over  Y  can  be  increased  by  adding  a  third 
alternative that is clearly inferior to X but not to Y.

Respondents chose between alternatives

Group 1

An elegant (CROSS) pen:

Group 2

An elegant (CROSS) pen:
An ugly pen

Focussing Customers' Attention

Focussing attention on one alternative can increase the perceived 
attractiveness of that alternative.

Group 1 “How attractive do you find frozen yogurt?”

frozen yogurt
fruit salad

Group 2 “How attractive do you find fruit salad?”

Mental Accounts

Would you buy a $10 theater ticket if:

1.

2.

Upon arrival at the theater you discovered you had lost 
your original ticket (46% yes)

Upon arrival at the theater you discovered you had lost a 
$10 bill (88% yes)

Transaction Utility

You are lying on the beach on a hot day.  All you have to drink is ice 
water.  For the last hour you have been thinking how much you would 
enjoy a nice cold bottle of your favorite brand of beer.  

A companion gets up to go and make a phone call and offers to bring 
back a beer from the only nearby place where beer is sold - a fancy 
resort hotel/a small run-down grocery store.  

He says that the beer may be expensive and asks how much you are
willing to pay for the beer.  He says he will not buy the beer if it costs 
more than the price you state.   What price do you tell him?

Fancy resort hotel:
Small run-down grocery store: 

$2.65
$1.50

Credit Cards

– average credit card bid:

Other studies:
– charitable donations
– tipping
– direct response advertising
– mail-order catalogs

Adding Unneeded Optional Features

Fewer people bought a brand of brownie cake mix when it included
a sales promotion comprising an option to buy a Collector's plate 
for $6.19

Fewer people bought a brand of film when it included a sales 
promotion comprising an option to buy a golf umbrella for $8.29

Offering an installment billing option in a premium catalog reduced 
demand

Reconciling Departures 
From The Rational Utility Model

Customers’ evaluations depend upon the context:
– not a deterministic process
– no pre-existing preferences
– explains why customers cannot describe the importance 
of individual needs

Disadvantage:  hard to predict behavior

Advantage:  can influence how customers perceive your product

Summary

Search
– Cost vs. benefit of searching
– Their own expertise
– Biases

Inferences
– Brand
– Other price and quality cues

Trading off different attributes
– Measuring tradeoffs (conjoint)
– Context will affect tradeoffs
