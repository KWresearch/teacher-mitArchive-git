Pricing

Overview

Equate marginal costs and marginal revenue 

Costs

Demand
– Lack of data
– Price perceptions
– Vary prices across segments

How do managers work all of this out?

Costs

Many firms do not know their costs

Easier to determine than demand
– Firms have cost data
– Additive not multiplicative

Interested in variable costs
– Not fixed costs
– Not sunk costs

Demand: Lack of Data

Availability of data:
– No data available for some products 
– Data only valid within relevant range
– Data may not capture all effects (e.g. store count)

Price Discrimination

Target marketing:
– different segments have different demands
– different segments have different competition (UPS)

Must be able to restrict resale:
– size of product prevents re-shipment (cars)
– FDA or regulatory controls (crimps on toothpaste)
– perceived difference (dental products)

Can Managers Work All of This Out?

Much to consider:

Begin simply:

costs 
demand elasticities
cues (customer inferences)
competitive reactions

cost plus
match competitors
manufacturers' recommendation

Fine tune:

need detailed response information
biased if feedback incomplete

Summary

What are the variables costs?

Is there sufficient demand data – if not begin by varying 
prices?

How well do customers know prices?

Do you have different customer segments – if so how 
can you discriminate?
