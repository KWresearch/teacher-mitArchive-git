Refresher
Coordination and Incentives

Coordination
Decisions are mutually dependent

Incentive Conflicts 
Goals not aligned

When is Coordination Difficult?

Too many decision makers 
– large firms

Decision makers too far from information
– May Company

Specialization
– different languages (May Company)
– different information systems (Continental)

Incentive problems 
– Continental

Incentives: When Do Problems Arise?

Goals not congruent
– Within firms: vacations
– Between firms: wholesale price

Implications
– Distort information
– Distort actions and decisions

Relationship between incentives and coordination

Solutions

Channel Design
– Resources
– Coordination
– Incentives

Channel Management
– Contracts
– Co-location
– Standardization
– Exclusivity

Channel Design
Does Outsourcing Help or Hinder Coordination?

Helps: Coordination is difficult at large firms
– Decision makers too far apart (decentralized)
– Decision makers too far from information (centralized)

Hinders: Coordination is difficult between firms
– The procurement process (Knez and Simester)
– More decision makers (Burger King)
– Proprietary information (Continental)
– Harder to standardize (Continental)
– Co-location less likely

Channel Design
Does Outsourcing Help or Hinder Incentive Issues?

Helps: if goals are consistent
– Owners are more motivated than managers
– Example: owners are better at supervising employees 
than managers

Hinders: if goals are inconsistent
– Example: Burger King cannot implement the McDonald’s 
ordering system

Two Intermediate Solutions

1. Hybrid channels 
Channel conflict (State Farm)

2.  Outsourcing is not the only option
Vertically integrated Chicago Tribune
Franchising  Pizza Hut
Licensing  Tiger Woods
Cooperatives  Ace Hardware
Joint Venture  Sematech
Strategic Alliances  Coke and McDonalds
Outsourced  Nike

Franchising

Resources
– Means of raising capital / sharing risk
– Human capital

Incentives
– Owners instead of managers 
– Objectives of franchisor and franchisee not perfectly aligned
– Must credibly signal demand to initial franchisees
– Franchisees often slow down and balk at ongoing royalties

Coordination
– Decision-makers closer to the information
– More decision-makers

Joint Ventures

Resources
– Success depends upon complementary resources
– Common reason for failure: parents fail to contribute

Incentives
– Objectives aligned within the joint venture but not with parents
– More likely to fail if parents compete

Coordination
– Standardization and co-location within joint venture
– Remove proprietary concerns within joint venture
– Resulting organizations often smaller
– An additional decision-maker

Bose:  JIT Program

– Will the firm become too big to coordinate?
– Who is easier to manage: owners or managers? 

Channel Management
– Use contracts to align incentives
– Co-location
