Channel suggestions:

aspirin prevents heart attacks 

Foreign markets :

Muesli breakfast cereal

Consumers:

Basic research:

Competitors:

Employees:

Lite beer

nylon

diet colas

baking soda is a deodorizer

personal computers

Idea Screening

Screen impractical and infeasible ideas

Write down your success criteria

Product can be introduced within 5 years
Market potential of at least $50 million
Market has at least a 15% growth rate
Product will yield at least 30% return on sales
Product will yield at least 40% return on investment
Product will achieve technical or market leadership

Separate tasks of sponsoring and evaluating the idea

Concept Testing

Product Concept
Target market 
Needs

Powder to add to milk to increase its nutrition / taste
An instant breakfast drink for adults who want a quick nutritious breakfast 
with little preparation
A tasty snack drink for children as a midday refreshment
A health supplement for older adults to drink before retiring

Concept Testing

Begin informally (CD exchange service)

If advertising is important, advertise before the product is 
available

Do not ignore the results:  “just using the wrong copy”

Concept Testing

A powdered product that is added to milk to make an instant 
breakfast providing all of the required nutrition in a convenient, 
tasty drink.  The product would be offered in chocolate, vanilla
and strawberry flavors and would be packaged individually and 
sold in packs of 6 for 79 cents.

1.  Does this product satisfy a need for you?
2.  Do other products currently satisfy this need?
3.  Is the price reasonable in relation to value?
4.  Would you purchase this product?
5.  How frequently would you use this product?

Market Testing

Consumer Products
– Simulated Test
– Controlled Test
– Test Market
Industrial Products
– Alpha Test
– Beta Test
– Test Market
Generally optimistic because attention is focused

Under-test: perceived risk of competitive entry

Business Plan
Financial Predictions

Costs are additive

Demand is multiplicative

Estimating demand is even harder when:
– Multiple needs 
– Needs vary across segments
– Needs are measured on non-monetary scales
– Product is very new/different
– Benefits are hard to evaluate (predict perceptions)

Summary

You need a lot of ideas
Write down your success criteria
Get independent advice to ensure objectivity
The standard is: overwhelming enthusiasm
Do not reinterpret or ignore the evidence
Competitors respond to customers’ reactions 
Focus on validating your demand forecasts
