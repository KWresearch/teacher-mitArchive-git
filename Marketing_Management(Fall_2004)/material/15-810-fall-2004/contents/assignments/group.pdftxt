Group Case Reports 
 
 
Each group will be required to hand in three case write-ups.  You may choose 
from the following menu: 
 

Vestron or Barco 
Optical Distortion or Tweeter etc. 
Boston Whaler or Michael Bregman  

 
The reports should consist of (at most) 3 pages and should address the 
questions that will be distributed.  Your reports must be handed in at the start of 
the class in which the case will be discussed.  These cases will be graded and 
will determine 40% of your overall grade.   
 
Questions for each case are also posted.  Use these questions to guide your 
reports (and to help prepare for our discussion of the other cases).  Some 
additional recommendations: 
 

Your write-ups should be in bullet point form.   

Separately answer each question.  Use headings to highlight which 
questions you are answering. 

Start with the most obvious points and then work from there.  Do 
not omit the obvious points. 

1. 
 
2. 

 
3. 

 

4. 

I am more interested in the quality of your analysis than the 
accuracy of your conclusions.  Make sure that you give both the 
pros and the cons of each alternative. 

 
  5.  Read the previous week's lecture notes before writing your 
analysis. 

 
  6.  Structure your answers using sub-headings if necessary to make it 
clear that you have used an analytical approach to reach your 
answers.  The grader will be treating (apparently) random lists of 
issues with caution. 

 
A common remark made by students after the case discussions is that their 
group talked about most of the important points but ran out of space in which to 
write them all down.  This is symptomatic.  The role of the course is to help you 
to identify which of the details hidden in the myriad of facts comprising each case 
are most relevant.  The page constraint forces you to reveal to me what you think 
is relevant.
