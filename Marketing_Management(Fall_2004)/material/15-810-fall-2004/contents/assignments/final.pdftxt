Marketing Management 
 
Fall 2004 
Final Group Exercise 

 
 
I would like you to select a small company with sales of under $25 million that has been 
in business for less than 5 years.   
 

1.  Pick one product (or service) that this company sells and identify the different 
customer segments that might purchase this product.  Treat these segments as 
different potential markets and describe the relative size of each market.    

 

 

 

2.  Pick one of the companyâ€™s existing or potential competitors and list the resources 
that the company has and the resources that the competitor has.  Restrict attention 
to just one competitor (assume that other competitors do not exist).   

3.  Use your analysis of the customer segments and resources to identify the 
customer segment that makes the most attractive target market for the firm. 

4.  Design a positioning statement for the firm.  Assume that the purpose of the 
positioning statement is to give direction to an advertising agency that will design 
an advertising campaign that targets your chosen market. 

 
 
Deliverables 
 
Please write a report of no more than 4 pages addressing the strategic issues (1 through 3 
above).  This report can be in bullet-point format. 
 
The positioning statement should be brief, but may include examples identifying firms in 
other markets with comparable brands.  Please keep this statement (including examples) 
to under 2 pages. 
 
You should combine the two documents (report and positioning statement) into a single 
document of no more than 6 pages.  The document is due by 5pm on Monday, November 
15.
