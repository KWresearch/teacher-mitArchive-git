1.  What needs do customers have in this market? 
 
They want to feel better: 
•  Alleviate symptoms from 4 primary conditions 
•  Cure to cause 

 
Low price sensitivity: 
•  Generics are 30%-50% cheaper and have less than 10% share 
•  No true differentiation: suggests customers should be price sensitive 
•  There is perceived differentiation: this reduces customers’ price sensitivity 

 
Convenience 
•  Purchase from nearest store 
•  Would a customer go to a different store in order to find a preferred brand? 

 
Information about which products to use 
 
 
2.  Why are customers so confused? 
 
The benefits of search are high – why are customers not searching? 
 
Hard to search for information: 
•  Customers do not have sufficient expertise to interpret the active ingredient information on 
the back of the package 

 
Although customers have extensive experience, the feedback about product efficacy is imprecise: 
•  Not easy to diagnose cause from symptoms 
•  Relief often comes from resolution of cause (i.e. you get well) 
•  Customers often take multiple drugs 

 
Advertising is confusing 
•  No credible quality claims (e.g. no MIT research to prove it is more effective)  
•  Manufacturers make different claims for the same ingredients 

 
 
 

3.  Would manufacturers like to resolve customer confusion? 
 
Customers  are  over-subscribing  –  it  would  be  better  if  they  were  informed.   Consider  a 
hypothetical advertising campaign, which could effectively resolve customers’ information 
need.  Would manufacturers invest in such a campaign? 
 
Branded products have  little  to gain  from  resolving  customer uncertainty:  this provides  the only 
source of differentiation 
 

•  Lack of objective information prompts customers to rely on past perceptions 
•  Brands have created artificial differentiation through perceptions 
•  Lack  of  objective  information  makes  this  differentiation  sustainable  (hard  to  change 
perceptions without objective information)

Manufacturers of generic products also have little to gain from resolving customer uncertainty: 
 

•  Advertising to inform customers will increase costs - raising prices 
•  Low entry barriers - if customers are informed other generics can enter and compete  

How  does  the  absence  of  verifiable  information  (that  customers  can 
interpret) affect competition?  

•  Customers must rely on perceptions (expectations) 
•  Lack of verifiable information makes it hard to change perceptions 

 
Well-established sales force and distribution 
•  Comparative advantage in food distribution outlets and mass merchandisers 
•  Not valuable in segments that shop in other markets 
 
Demand information – learn from Slex failure 
•  Other firms probably do not have this information 

 
Cash 
•  But competitors also have cash (one competitor is twice the size) 
 

 
Resources Vicks Lacks 
 
No actual improvement over current formulations (although nor do other firms) 
 
Competitors have established brands and perceptions in other segments 
 
 
6.  What  factors  reduce  the  profit  that  Vicks  earns  from  its  current 
branded products? 

Resources Vicks Has 

5. 
 
Favorable quality perceptions associated with the Vicks (and NyQuil) brands.   Given the absence of 
verifiable information that customers can interpret, customers use brands to form inferences about 
product quality.  Vicks’ favorable quality perceptions result from the following cues (each of which 
are hard for new entrants to mimic): 
•  Age of brand  
•  Market share  
•  Amount of advertising (though not content of advertising) 
•  Your mother rubbing it on your chest  

 
Profits would be higher if there was more surplus in their current segments: 
• 
Increase number of sufferers 
• 
Increase frequency of illness amongst sufferers 

 
Profits would be higher if they had more market power at their level of the channel 
•  No competitors 
•  Real differentiation from existing competitors 
•  Maintain perceived differentiation without incurring advertising cost 

 
Profits would be higher if retailers had less market power 
•  More competing drug stores located closer together 
•  Customers will generally not go to another store to find preferred brand 

Is the proposed new product idea likely to succeed? 

7. 
 
 
What will differentiate this new product from other products currently targeting this segment? 
•  Brand name: useful only for coughs/liquids? 
•  Cash for advertising 
•  Distribution: relationships with food distribution and mass merchandise retailers 

 
 
Summary 
 
Is this sufficient to differentiate the new product from existing competitors? This is a decision with 
incomplete information, although we do have some information.  The previous failed launch had the 
distribution and cash resources. Therefore, a test market would be helpful to investigate whether the 
use of the Vicks name will provide sufficient differentiation.

The product was not successful: 
• 
It was not a unique or superior product 
•  Customers  did  not  perceive  that  it  would  satisfy  their  needs  any  better  than  existing 
alternatives

Key Issue:  Is the proposed new product likely to succeed? 
 
What will differentiate this new product from other products currently targeting this segment? 
•  Vicks brand name: useful only for coughs/liquids? 
•  Cash for advertising 
•  Distribution - relationships with retailers 

 
Is this sufficient to differentiate the new product from existing competitors? This is a decision with 
incomplete information, although we do have some information.  The previous failed launch had the 
distribution and cash resources. Therefore, a test market would be helpful to investigate whether the 
use of the Vicks name will provide sufficient differentiation. 
 
Alternatively, you might discuss why the Vick’s brand name is so important: 
•  Lack of objective information prompts customers to rely on past perceptions 
•  Brands have created artificial differentiation through perceptions 
•  Lack of objective information makes this differentiation sustainable (hard to change 
perceptions without objective information)
