III.1- The Iodine Clock Reaction 

Introduction 
In  this  experiment,  you  will  study  a  reaction  that  proceeds  at  an  easily  measured  rate  at 
room temperature: 

2 - +  2I-
S2O8
iodide 
persulfate 

2 - +  I2 
2SO4
iodine 
sulfate 

In  the  first  part  of  the  experiment,  the  rate  equation will  be  determined  by  investigating 
the effect of the concentration of the reactants on the rate of the persulfate-iodide reaction.  In the 
second  part,  the  activation  energy  will  be  calculated  by  studying  the  effects  of  temperature 
change and addition of a catalyst on the reaction system. 

Background 
Given the equation for a general reaction: 
aA + bB   Products
 

The dependence of the rate of the reaction on the concentration of the reactants may be expressed 
by a rate equation of the form: 
rate  = k [ A]l[ B ]m 

where,  k  is  the  rate  constant  (or  rate  coefficient);  l  and  m  are  the  orders  of  the  reaction  with 
respect  to  the  reactants A  and  B,  respectively;  and    the  sum  l  + m   is  the  overall  reaction  order. 
Unlike  the  stoichiometric  coefficients  determined  by  calculation,  the  orders  of  the  reaction  are 
based on the kinetics of the reaction.  The orders of the reaction are defined by the mechanism of 
the  reaction,  which  is  an  account  of  the  actual  steps  by  which  the  molecules  combine.    Orders 
can only be determined experimentally. 
The effect of temperature on reaction rate is given by the Arrhenius equation: 

k = A e- E / RT 
a

where  A  is  the  Arrhenius  constant,  Ea  the  activation  energy  of  the  reaction,  T  the  absolute 
temperature, and R the universal constant of gases. 

Description of the Experiment 
In  this  experiment,  we  study  the  kinetics  of  the  reaction  between  persulfate  S2O82- and 
iodide I- ions:

Rates  of  reaction  are  measured  by  either  following  the  appearance  of  a  product  or  the 
disappearance  of  a  reactant.   In  this  experiment,  the  rate  of  consumption  of  the  iodine  will  be 
measured  to  determine  the  rate  of  the  reaction.  As  reaction  (1)  runs,  the  amount  of  iodine  (I2) 
produced from it will be followed using reaction (2):

(2) 

The  iodine  produced  from  the  persulfate-iodide  reaction  (1)  is  immediately  reduced  back  to 
iodide by  thiosulfate  ions (2).  A known amount of  thiosulfate  ions will be  added  to  the reaction 
vessel  which  will  in  turn  consume  iodine  as  it  is  produced.
  This  continues  until  all  the 
thiosulfate  has  been  converted  to  tetrathionate,  whereupon  free  iodine  will  start  to  form  in  the 
solution  via  reaction  (1).
  Because  we  know  the  amount  of  thiosulfate  we  added,  we  can 
determine  the  amount  of  iodine  produced  from  reaction  (1)  stoichiometrically.   When  all  the 
thiosulfate  is  consumed,  free  iodine  starts  to  form  in  solution.   By measuring  the  time  taken  for 
the  known  amount  of  thiosulfate  to  be  consumed,  the  rate  of  production  of  iodine  during  that 
time can be calculated. 
The  color  of  the  iodine  formed  might  be  intense  enough  that  it  can  act  as  its  own 
indicator;  however,  for  better  results,  you  will  add  starch,  which  produces  a  deep  blue  starch-
iodine complex:

2-)  react  to  produce  iodine  (I2)  and  sulfate 
In  summary,  iodide  (I-)  and  persulfate  ions  (S2O8
2-) in reaction (1). This iodine is immediately consumed by the thiosulfate ions (S2O3
2-) in a 
(SO4
2- ions  are  consumed,  the  excess 
pathway  described  by  reaction  (2).  As  soon  as  all  of  the  S2O3
iodine  produced  in  (1)  is  free  to  react with  starch,  turning  the  solution  blue  (3).  The  amount  of 
thiosulfate  ions  added  tells  us  how  much  iodine  had  been  produced  in  the  time  taken  for  the 
reaction to turn blue. 

Rate equation 
The  rate  of  the  reaction  at  constant  temperature  and  ionic  strength  can  be  expressed  as 
the change in concentration of a reagent or product over the change in time and can be equated to 
the rate law expression:

This  reaction  rate  is  a  measure  of  how  much  iodine  was  produced  in  the  time  it  took  for  the 
reaction to turn blue (i.e., time taken to react with all of the thiosulfate present). 

Reaction Orders 
In  this  experiment  we  use  the  initial  rate  method   to  find  the  order  of  the  reaction  with 
respect  to persulfate  (m)  and  the order of  the  reaction with  respect  to  iodide  (n).   The method  is 
based  on  the measurement  of  the  rate  of  the  reaction  over  a  period  of  time.  This  time  period  is 
short  enough  for  the  reaction  not  to  have  proceeded  significantly,  but  long  enough  to  be 
unaffected by the time which the solutions take to mix at the start of the reaction. 
The rate law equation can be written as: 
m [ I

2  ]
rate  = k [S2O8

By taking the natural log of both sides, the equation becomes: 

2 ] + n  ln[ I  ] 
ln  rate  = ln k  + m  ln[S2O8

iodide at a constant temperature,

The  constant  term  in  this  equation  is  lnk + n  ln  [I-].   The  slope of  the best  fit  line of  a plot of  ln 
2-] will be equal to m, the order of reaction with respect to persulfate. 
rate versus ln[S2O8
Similarly,  for  runs where persulfate  concentration  and  temperature  are kept  constant  and 
the amount of iodide is varied, 

ln  rate  = n  ln[ I  ] + constant 
The constant  term  is  lnk + m  ln[S2O82-].   The slope of  the best fit  line of a plot of  ln  rate versus 
ln[I-] will be equal to n, the order of reaction with respect to iodide. 

Activation energy (Ea) 
Recall the Arrhenius equation: 
k = A e- E / RT 
a

Taking natural logarithm of both sides of this equation we obtain: 
Ea	 1
ln k  =  
+ ln A 
R T 

A plot of ln k versus 1/T yields a straight line whose slope is -Ea/R and whose y-intercept is ln A, 
the natural logarithm of the Arrhenius constant. 

Procedure 
Effect of Persulfate and Iodide Concentrations on Rate 

You will be provided with the following solutions: 

(i)  Standardized  Na2S2O3  solution  (about  0.1  M,   BE  SURE  TO  RECORD  EXACT  VALUE); 
(ii)  0.1M  potassium  persulfate,  K2S2O8;  (iii)  0.2M  potassium  iodide,  KI;  (iv)  0.2M  potassium 
chloride, KCl; (v) 0.1M potassium sulfate, K2SO4. 

The rate coefficient (k) of ionic reactions depends on the ionic strength or salinity of the solution. 
Potassium  chloride  (KCl)  and potassium  sulfate  (K2SO4) are used  to maintain  the  ionic  strength 
of the solutions. 

1.	 Prepare  a  4.0x10-3  M  solution  of  sodium  thiosulfate  as  follows:  Rinse  a  clean  250mL 
volumetric  flask  with  distilled  water.  Pipette  an  aliquot  of  10  mL  of  the  standardized 
thiosulfate  solution  into  the volumetric  flask  and  add distilled water  to  the mark on  the neck 
of  the flask. Stopper and  invert  the flask a few  times  to mix  its contents. Transfer  the diluted 
thiosulfate solution into a clean labeled plastic bottle. This diluted solution will be used along 
the experiment.

2.	 Label  a  50mL  Erlenmeyer  flask  "A"  and  a  50mL  beaker  "R",  the  reaction  beaker.   For  each 
run of  the reaction, make up glassware as shown  in  the chart below.   Between runs, rinse  the 
flasks THOROUGHLY with distilled water.

3.	 For  each  run,  start  stirring  the  reaction beaker.   Then, dump  the  contents of  flask  "A"  into  it 
and  immediately begin  timing.   Record  the  "Blue  Time"  (the  time  in  seconds needed  for  the 
solution  to  turn  blue)  for  each  run.   Deposit  all waste  in  the  liquid waste  container.    ***Do

Discussion and Calculations 

Prepare the folowing graphs: 
2-], for runs where [I-] is constant (runs 2, 4 and 5). 
1.	  ln rate  versus ln[S2O8
2.	  ln rate versus ln[I-],  for runs where [S2O8
2-] is constant (runs 1, 2 and 3). 
3.	
ln k versus 1/T for runs at constant concentrations but variable temperature. 

For  these graphs draw a best-fit  line.   The  slopes  of graph 1 and graph 2 will give you m 
and  n,  respectively  (round  them  to  their  nearest  integer  values).    The  slope  of  graph  3 will  give 
you -Ea/R and the intercept lnA. 

In  your  calculations,  you  should  keep  in  mind  that  the  starting  concentration  in  the 
reaction  vessel  for  each  reagent  is not  simply what was printed on  the bottle.     For  instance,  for 
the first run in Part One, you used 20 mL of the 0.2M KI solution; however, when the reaction is 
run,  the  actual  concentration  of  iodide,  at  start,  is  not  0.2M.  Find  the  concentration  of  the  two 
reagents (iodide and persulfate) used in each run (Hint:  what dilutions have occurred?).

Since  the  total  volume  in  every  reaction  is  25 mL  and  5 mL  of  the  dilute  thiosulfate  solution  is 
used  in every reaction,  the only quantity  in  this equation  that will change  is  the  time.   Be  sure  to 
account for all dilutions in the sodium thiosulfate solution concentration. 

Once you have determined m and n , the rate constant k  is calculated from: 
rate
k  =

2  ]m [ I  ]n


[ S2O8

Your final k value (at room  temperature) should be  the average of  the  k values obtained for runs 
1 through 5 in Part One.  Make sure to give the units for k. 

Goals 
1)  Determine the experimental rate law 
2)  Propose a mechanism consistent with the experimental rate law.  (Do not worry if it is the  
correct mechanism, only that the experimental rate law can be derived from it) 
3)  Determine the activation energy and Arrhenius constant for the reaction.
