IV. Organic Chemistry: Compounds with Interesting Properties


IV.1- Polymers: Nylon 6-10 

Background 

Polymers  are  giant  molecules,  or  macromolecules.    Proteins  (silk,  muscle  fibers,  enzymes), 
polysaccharides  (starch  and  cellulose),  rubber,  and  nucleic  acids  are  natural  polymers.   On  the 
other hand, polyester  (in  clothes  and  rugs)  , vinyl (in  chairs), Formica (in  tabletops), polyacrylic 
and polypropylene (in rugs), nylon (in parachutes and pantyhose),  latex (in paints), polyurethane 
(in  protective  coatings),  melamine  (in  dishes),  Teflon  (in  frying  pan  coatings,  hairbrushes, 
toothbrushes,  electrical  insulators,  heart  valves,  airplane  windshields,  etc.),  are  all  examples  of 
man-made polymers. 

Polymers  fall  into  three  general  classifications:  elastomers,  those  polymers  with  elastic 
properties,  like  rubber;  fibers,  the  threadlike  polymers,  such  as  cotton,  silk,  or  nylon;  and 
plastics, which can be thin sheets, hard moldable solids, or coatings. 

Nylon, a polyamide, is formed in the reaction between a diamine and a diacid chloride.

Polyamides,  as well  as polyesters,  are  step-growth polymers because  each bond  in  the polymer 
is formed  independently of  the others.   By contrast, alkene and diene polymers are called chain-
growth polymers because they are produced by chain reactions.

Materials:
 Solution A:  30 mL 0.5 M hexamethylenediamine  

[H2N(CH2)6NH2  (1,6-diaminohexane) in 0.5 M NaOH] 

 Solution B: 1.0±0.2 mL sebacoyl chloride, ClCO(CH2)8COCl, in 30 mL hexane   

[30 mL 0.2 M sebacoyl chloride in hexane]

 250 mL beaker

 150 mL beaker

 Glass stir rod

 Forceps


Safety:   Hexanes are very volatile. Do not use near heat source such as a hotplate.  They may be 
irritating  to  the  respiratory  tract  and,  in  high  concentrations,  narcotic.  Inhalation  of  sebacoyl 
Chloride  is destructive  to  the  tissue  of  the mucous membranes  and upper  respiratory  tract,  eyes, 
and skin. 

-

Procedure: 
Pour the Hexamethylenediamine solution into the 250 mL beaker. 
-
Pour  the Sebacoyl Chloride solution  into  the 150 mL beaker. Do  this quickly but carefully  to 
minimize spilling. 
SLOWLY  pour 
the 
rod  onto 
stir 
the  glass 
the  Sebacoyl  Chloride  down 
Hexamethylenediamine.  Careful  do  not  let  the  stir  rod  touch  the  Hexamethylenediamine 
layer. Do not mix the two layers. 
- Using forceps (or copper wire) gently grab the film of Nylon in between the two layers. 
- Gently pull the nylon onto a glass stir rod.

Clean-Up: 
Dispose in designated containers. Throw the dried nylon in the trash.

III.2- Dyes: Methyl Orange 

Background 
Some  types  of  organic  structures  give  rise  to  color,  while  others  do  not.    The  partial  structures 
necessary  for  color  (unsaturated groups  that  can undergo  *  and n *  transitions)  are  called 
chromophores.  Some common chromophores are: 

C C 

C C 

N N 

NO2 

A  dye  is  a  colored  organic  compound  that  is  used  to  impart  color  to  an  object  or  a  fabric.  Azo 
dyes,  colored  compounds  containing  the  -N=N-  group,  are  the  largest  and more  important  class 
of  dyes.    In  azo-dyeing,  the  fabric  is  first  impregnated  with  an  aromatic  compound  activated 
toward  electrophilic  substitution,  then  is  treated  with  a  diazonium  salt  to  form  the  dye  (see 
reactions below). 
An acid-base  indicator  is an organic compound  that changes color with a change  in pH.   Methyl 
orange    is  a  very  common  acid-base  indicator,  red in  solutions  that have pH values  less  than 3.2 
and  yellow  in  solutions  with  pH  greater  than  4.4.    Indicators  change  color  because  the 
chromophoric system is changed by an acid base reaction (see below). 

Materials:
 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask  
 250 mL beaker
 1.1 g of sulfanilic acid 
13  mL  of  2.5  %  sodium  carbonate  (0.35  g  of  anhydrous  sodium  carbonate  in  13  mL  of 
water) 
 0.5 g of sodium nitrite  

 8 g of ice (approximately)

 1.3 mL concentrated HCl
 0.8 mL of N,N-dimethylaniline
 0.7 mL of glacial acetic acid 
 8.5 mL of 3 M sodium hydroxide  

 saturated sodium chloride solution  

 0.5 mL of 1 M sodium sulfate  

 1 M sulfuric acid  


Safety:   N,N-Dimethylanaline  is  combustible. Keep  away  from  heat  sources  such  as  hot  plates. 
Concentrated  hydrochloric  acid,  glacial  (concentrated)  acetic  acid  are  corrosive  and  will  cause 
severe  burns.    Solutions  of  sodium  hydroxide  and  sulfuric  acid  are  corrosive  and  will  cause 
burns.  Avoid  skin  contact  with  diazonium  salts.  Some  diazonium  salts  are  explosive  when  dry. 
Always use in solution.

- Cool the solution under the tap and add 0.5 g of sodium nitrite, and stir until it is dissolved. 
- Pour the solution into a 200 mL beaker containing about 8 g of ice (estimate, do not weigh) and 
1.3  mL  of  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid.  In  a  minute  or  two  a  powdery  precipitate  of  the 
diazonium salt should separate, and the material is then ready for use.

- In a test tube, thoroughly mix 0.8 mL of N,N-dimethylaniline and 0.7 mL of glacial acetic acid. 
Careful!!! Work under the hood!!! 
-  To  the  suspension  prepared  in  part  (a)  add,  with  stirring,  the  solution  of  N,N-dimethylaniline 
acetate. 
- Rinse the test tube with a small quantity of water and add it to the beaker. 
-  Stir  and  mix  thorougly.  Within  a  few  minutes  the  red,  acid-stable  form  of  the  dye  should 
separate. A stiff paste should result in 5 to 10 minutes.  (Note: if too much water is added it won't 
be stiff) 
- Add  8.5 mL  of  3 M  sodium  hydroxide  solution  to  produce  the  orange  sodium  salt.  (It will  be 
foamy) 
- Stir well and heat the mixture just to the boiling point. 

- Place the beaker in a pan of ice and water, and allow the solution to cool undisturbed. 
-  Collect  the  product  on  a  Büchner  funnel,  using  saturated  sodium  chloride  solution  to  rinse  the 
flask and wash  the filter cake.   Use  the house vacuum  line (not  the water aspirator).   Be sure  the 
filter paper fits properly and is wet (with distilled water) prior to filtration. 

(c) Dyeing 
-  In  a 30mL beaker, prepare  a dye bath by dissolving 50 mg of Methyl Orange  and 0.5 mL of 1 
M sodium sulfate solution in 15 mL of water.  Add 5 drops of 1 M sulfuric acid. 
- Place a small piece of fabric in the bath at a temperature near the boiling point. 
-  After  about  5  minutes,  remove  the  fabric  from  the  bath  and  let  it  cool.  Rinse  fabric  in  the 
marked rinse beakers prior  to washing  it  thoroughly under running water and soap before drying 
it. 
- Dip the cloth into dilute acid and then dilute base.  Account for any changes. 

Clean Up: Collect all waste in the designated containers.
