II. Redox Chemistry


II.1- Tollen's Test for Aldehydes and Ketones (a.k.a. The Silver Mirror) 

Background 
Silver  (I)  is  reduced  to  silver  metal  by  aldehydes,  but  not  by  ketones.   Dextrose  (D-glucose,  a  

monosaccharide) is a polyhydroxyaldehyde which reduces silver.

In solution, either - or -D-glucose (see figure II.2.1 below), undergoes a slow equilibrium with

the open-chain form and with the other anomer.  This equilibrium is called mutarotation.

Sucrose  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  disaccharide,  a 
combination  of  glucose  and  fructose  (figure  II.2.2)  in 
which  both  anomeric  carbon  atoms  are  used  in  the 
glycoside  link.  Therefore,  sucrose  in  water  is  not  in 
equilibrium with an aldehyde or keto form, and does not 
exhibit  mutarotation  and  thus  is  not  a  reducing  sugar. 
Sucrose  however  breaks  down  in  the  basic  Tollen's 
Reagent and the resulting glucose will reduce the silver.

Materials:
 Two 15mL test tubes.
 Nitric Acid (HNO3) 
 Distilled water  
 0.1 M Silver Nitrate (AgNO3) 

 Concentrated Ammonia (NH3) 

 0.80 M Potassium Hydroxide (KOH)
 0.25 M Glucose  
 0.25 M Sucrose  

Safety:      Concentrated  nitric  acid  and  concentrated  ammonium  hydroxide  are  highly  corrosive 
and will  cause  severe burns.   Vapors  are harmful.  Nitric  acid  is  also  a powerful oxidizing  agent 
that  may  ignite  or  react  explosively  with  many  inorganic  and  organic  substances.    Potassium 
hydroxide  solutions  are  irritating  and  may  cause  burns  depending  upon  the  concentration  and 
length  of  exposure.    Acetone  is  volatile  and  highly  flammable.    Do  not  use  near  a  heat  source. 
Silver nitrate solutions are irritating and oxidizing.   Carry out the experiment in a well-ventilated 
hood. 

Procedure: 
- Rinse the test tubes with distilled water, nitric acid, water, acetone, and water in that order. 
- Add 5 mL of 0.1 M silver nitrate to each test tube. 
- Pour small amounts of ammonia to the silver nitrate solution and swirl until the solution is a 
brown color (muddy). 
- Keep adding ammonia to this muddy mixture until it becomes colorless and clear again. 

12


- Add about 2.5 mL of Potassium Hydroxide.  If the solution becomes muddy (and remains after 
mixing), add more ammonia until the solution becomes colorless and clear again. 
- To one test tube add 5 mL of glucose. To the other add 5 mL of sucrose. (Label testtubes first) 
- At the same time, place the test tubes in a hot water bath. 
- Swirl the tubes lightly and record your observations. 

Clean-Up: The chemical waste should be disposed in the designated containers. 

Discussion: Write  the  balanced  chemical  equations  for  all  processes,  including  for  the  addition 
of ammonia and potassium hydroxide.

II.2- The Copper Mirror 

Background 
Copper  is widely distributed  in Nature as metal,  in sulfides, arsenides, chlorides, carbonates, etc. 
Copper  is  also  the  third most  abundant metallic  element  in  the  human  body,  following  iron  and 
zinc,  and  it  is  important  in all other  life  forms.   Copper-containing biomolecules  like azurin  and 
plastocyanin  found  in  algae  and  green  leaves,  participate  in  electron  transfer  reactions. 
Hemocyanin, found  in molluscs,  is functions as an oxygen carrier.  Cytochrome c oxidase, found 
in  mitochondria,  participates  in  the  interconversion  between  water  and  oxygen.  The 
biochemistry of copper relies primarily in its oxidation-reduction chemistry.  Cu2+ in solution can 
be  reduced  to  metallic  copper  by  the  addition  of  a  strong  reducing  agent,  such  as  hydrazine 
(N2H4).    The  oxidation  products  of  hydrazine  are  strongly  dependent  on  the  pH  of  the  solution, 
the temperature, the oxidizing agent used and the catalytic impurities present: 

Materials:
  One large test tube
  5 mL of 1M copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution 
  1 mL of 85% hydrazine hydrate solution 

Safety: Hydrazine hydrate solutions are toxic, a suspected carcinogen, highly reactive and highly 
flammable.    Symptoms  of  exposure  include  burning  sensation,  coughing,  shortness  of  breath, 
headache, nausea.  Carry out the experiment in a well-ventilated hood. 

Procedure: 
-  Rinse  the  test  tube with  distilled water,  nitric  acid,  distilled water,  acetone,  and  distilled water 
in that order. 
- Add  5 mL of  copper  solution  to  the  test  tube,  followed by 1 mL of hydrazine hydrate  solution. 
Swirl once.  The blue solution will immediately turn to a brownish-green. 
- Immediately place the test tube in a hot water bath. 
- Swirl the tube lightly and record your observations. 

-  To  remove  copper  from  the  test  tube  walls  use  1  mL  (20  drops)  concentrated  nitric  acid. 
Record your observations.  Add 3 mL of water.  Record your observations. 

Clean-Up: The chemical waste should be disposed in the designated containers. 

Discussion: Write the balanced chemical equations for all processes.

II.3- Oxidation States of Vanadium: Reduction of V5+ to V2+ 

Background 
It  is  known  that  vanadium  in  extremely  small  amounts  is  a  nutritional  requirement  for  many 
types  of  organism,  possibly  including  higher  animals.    The  longest  know  example  of  vanadium 
in  biochemistry  is  the  accumulation  of  vanadium  by  certain  lower  marine  organisms  called 
tunicates.    They  concentrate  vanadium  by  a  factor  of  ~106  over  its  level  in  the  surrounding 
marine environment. 

Vanadium  exhibits  an  extended  redox  chemistry  and  can  exist  in  several  different  oxidation 
states, each with a characteristic color. 

Materials:
 Mercury zinc amalgam 
 Ammonium metavanadate solution 

Safety:  Mercury zinc amalgam is toxic, keep under aqueous solution. 

Procedure: 
- Place 5 grams of zinc amalgam in a 125mL Erlenmeyer flask. 
-  Add  20  mL  of  vanadium  solution.  The  solution  should  be  yellow.  Pour  a  small  amount  in  a 
small  

testtube as a reference. 
- Stopper the flask and gently swirl the solution. Record any color changes. Pour a small amount 
in a small testtube as a reference.  (Hint:  yellow + blue = green) 
- Swirl the flask again and record any color changes. Save a small amount in a small testtube as a  
reference. 
- Swirl the flask vigorously until another color change is observed. 
- Compare all the colored solutions.  Have the instructor or TA check the final color. 

- Optional:  Collect UV-VIS spectra on the colored solutions. 

Clean-up: The chemical waste should be disposed in the designated containers. 

Discussion: 
- Write the balanced chemical equations for each reduction step. Identify the colored species. 
Provide the oxidation state and the d electron count for each vanadium species. 
-
- Arrange the vanadium species in order of increasing crystal field splitting. 
- Can V5+ and V4+ exist free in aqueous solution? Why?

II.4- Corrosion 

Background 
Corrosion  reactions  are  redox  reactions  in  which  a  metal  is  attacked  by  some  substance  in  its 
environment  and  converted  to  an  unwanted  compound.    Corrosion  cuts  short  the  lifetimes  of 
steel  products  such  as  bridges  and  automobiles,  and  replacing  corroded metal  parts  cost  billions 
of dollars a year: about 20 percent of the iron produced annually in this country is used to replace 
iron  objects  that  have  been  discarded  because  of  rust  damage.  Rusting  of   iron  is  known  to 
require  oxygen  and  water.    The  rusting  process  is  summarized  in  the  following  figure  (figure

II.5- Photography - Cyanotypes1 

Background-Black and White Photography 
The earliest photographic (1830's) processes relied on printed out silver which requires long  
exposure times: 
2 AgX(s)

 h  > 2 Ag(s) + X2(g) 

X = Cl, Br, I 

In the 1840's the "latent" image was discovered. AgI was used as the silver halide and the 
"invisible" latent image was chemically developed.  This greatly shortened exposure times and 
became the basis for modern black and white photography: 

AgNO3(aq) + KX(aq)

 in gelatin   >  AgX(s) + K+(aq) + NO3  (aq) 
-

This reaction produces a colloidal suspension of AgX in a gelatin solution.

It is ripened (heated) to increase particle size of silver halide.

A hardener is added to stiffen the gelatin.

The gelatin is then coated onto a support such as:  

glass plate (1800's).

cellulose nitrate (fire hazard!!!) or acetate (safety film) for  negatives.

paper coated with baryta (BaSO4) for prints.

The gelatin is allowed to harden. 

NOTE:  the crystal structure and size of the silver halide crystals greatly 
affects light sensitivity of the film, and the sharpness of the image

 

2 AgX(s)

 h  > 2 Ag(s) + X2(g) 

To make the latent image viewable, use a metal reducing agent such as V2+ or Fe2+. 
M2+  + Ag+ 
 M3+  +  Ag° 

Or, more typically, use an organic reducing agent such as hydroquinone.

To stop the reaction, take advantage of the acid-base equilibrium by adding "stop bath" (acetic acid) 
to shift to the acid form of hydroquinone which is not readily oxidized. 

The print or negative is "fixed" as discussed in solubility equilibria by using "hypo" Na2S2O3 to 
remove unreacted AgX. 

Background - Cyanotypes 
In 1842, after the discovery of  the photosensitivity of ferric (Fe3+) salts, Sir John Herschel invented 
the cyanotype process.  This process involves coating a sheet of paper with a yellow light sensitive 
solution of ferric ammonium citrate and potassium ferricyanide.  Exposure to UV light reduces 
ferric (Fe3+) salt to the ferrous (Fe2+) state and ferricyanide (the Fe3+ in [Fe(CN)6]3-) to 
ferrocyanide (Fe2+ in [Fe(CN)6]4-).  The result is formation of a yellow blue image consisting of 
ferrous ferrocyanide.  Washing removes the yellow soluble, unreduced (unexposed) salts, leaving 
behind an insoluble  blue and white image.  The image intensifies with time as ferrous ferrocyanide 
is oxidized to the deep blue color of ferric ferrocyanide, also known as the artist's pigment Prussian 
blue.  The rate of oxidation can be increased by treating the image with an oxidizing solution. 

Procedure 

I.  Stock solutions:	  Prepare solutions at least 24 hours before coating paper and store in air tight 
brown bottles. 

Solution A:  50 mL distilled water at ~21 °C 
10.0 g Ferric ammonium citrate (green is preferable to brown)

Solution B:  50 mL distilled water at ~21 °C

 
 
4.0 g Potassium ferricyanide

II. Sensitize the paper: 

A. Choice of paper:	 To  get  good image resolution choose a paper that has 
1)  A smooth ‘hot pressed’ (HP) surface. 
2)  A high cotton or alpha-cellulose content. 
3)  An internal sizing agent, ideally with a pH of 7-7.5. 
4)  No alkaline buffering agents.  Paper pH<7. 
5)  Good wet strength (i.e. heavier weights of paper i.e., 160-200 g/m2). 
6)  No other additives such as fillers, brightners, retention aids, dyes, bleaches, wet-
strengthening agents... 

Note:  All papers have a ‘felt’ or ‘blanket’ side and a ‘wire side. The felt side generally has a more 
random texture and a less intrusive texture.  Paper is a chemical entity in its own right and each type 
of paper (and sometimes each batch of a paper) will behave in its own way with the chemicals. 

B. Choice of room light conditions:  Work with the solutions and sensitized paper under tungsten 
light. Daylight and fluorescent light will expose/fog the paper. 

C. Paper preparation: 
1. Cut the paper to leave a margin of at least an inch around the area to be coated to permit

handling.

2. Lightly pencil guide marks to indicate the area to be coated on the sheet of paper.  A cardboard

template the size of the negative may be used.

Note:  Avoid watermark area of paper.  Handle only by the edges to avoid transfer of moisture or

dirt from fingers to image area (including on the reverse).


D. Sensitization solution preparation: 
Note:  The total volume of sensitizer needed depends on the negative size, the type of paper, and 
absolute humidity.  There should be enough sensitizer to make 3-5 passes with the coating rod. 

1)  Prepare a 1:1 mixture of solution A (Ferric ammonium citrate) and solution B (Potassium 
ferricyanide) in a 10 ml beaker.  Use a separate syringe (no needle)  for each solution (label them). 

Use the following as a starting point: 
solution A (Ferric ammonium citrate) 0.2 ml 
solution B (Potassium ferricyanide) 0.2 ml 

2)  Use a third syringe to mix the solution thoroughly by passing the liquid in 
and out of a syringe two or three times. Use this syringe to transfer the sensitizer solution to the 
paper. 

E.  Transfer of the sensitizer solution to the paper: 
Note:  Coating should be done at a room temperature of between 18 and 22 °C and a relative 
humidity of around 75%. (If conditions are too cold or dry, surface crystallization will occur, and 
too high an ambient temperature or relative humidity may cause the solutions to penetrate too 
deeply into the paper). 

20


1)  Tape the marked paper onto a sheet of glass and clean the paper surface with a blower. 

2)  Arrange glass coating rod (it must be free of dust and grease), blotting paper, and loaded syringe 
nearby. 

3)  Gently eject solution from the syringe along the top of the coating area.  Place the glass rod 
spreader on the paper just above the liquid line. Draw the rod into the solution,  pause briefly (about 
a second), allowing the fluid to distribute itself evenly along the length of the rod.  Then smoothly 
pull the  spreader down the length of the area to be coated.  Coat 1-2 cm beyond the image area. 

The surface may  look blotchy at this stage, but it will even out in the next few moments.  One 
‘pass’ for a 10x15 cm area will take about 3 to 5 seconds.  Apply only a slight pressure, otherwise 
the paper surface will be abraded. At the bottom of the first pass, ‘hop’ the spreader over the line of 
solution and smoothly push it back up to the top of the sheet, thus repeating the process, but in the 
opposite direction. 

Make 3 to 5 passes  over the paper in this way. It is best to stop before all the solution has been 
absorbed into the paper.  Soak up the excess solution with a strip of blotting paper.  (Alternatively a 
brush maybe used to apply the solution). 

5.  Remove the paper from the sheet of glass.  Place the coated paper in the oven for 5-10 minutes. 
Ideally the temperature should be between 35-40 °C (95-105 F).  Allowing the dried paper to "rest" 
for half an hour or more may improve image quality.  Unlike other Fe, Pt, and Pd processes 
cyanotypes are relatively unaffected by relative humidity. 

III.  Image formation: 

1)  Place the dried paper in contact with the negative (sensitized surface to emulsion) in a contact 
printing frame.  This can be made from a clipboard, piece of art foam, piece of glass and rubber 
bands.  Alternatively, a purchused contact printing frame which permits opening halfway to check 
the image without disturbing the registration of the print and negative may be used. 

2)  Expose to UV light source. Printing times will vary according to negative density. The image is 
partially formed during the exposure. A commercial contact printing frame permits examination the 
print by opening one half without disturbing the registration of the negative to the print. This 
‘inspection’ must be carried out in an area shielded from the UV source, otherwise the print will be 
fogged. 

Caution: To prevent eye damage, do not look into UV sources. 

Note: the UV light source may be the sun, a sunlamp or a specially designed UV source (or even a 
tanning bed if you wish to do large images). 

3)  Clear print in a water bath for about 1 minute. Wash in running water for 5-10 minutes, or until 
highlight (white) areas in print have cleared. 

4)  Hang to dry.
