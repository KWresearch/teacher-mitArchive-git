I. Chemical Equilibrium


I.1- Coordination Chemistry: Nickel Complexes 

Background 
Ni2+  in  aqueous  solution  exists  as  the  octahedral  complex  ion  hexaaquanickel  (II),  [Ni(H2O)6]2+. 
When  the  bidentate  ethylenediamine  ligand  (en)  is  added  to  the  solution  in  a  1:1  concentration 
ratio, it replaces two water ligands of the [Ni(H2O)6]2+ to form [Ni(H2O)4(en)]2+:

Discussion: 

- Draw the missing isomers in the Background section and describe in each case the type of 
isomerism. 

- At approximately what wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum do these complexes, 
[Ni(H2O)6]2+, [Ni(H2O)4(en)]2+, [Ni(H2O)2(en)2]2+, [Ni (en)3]2+, absorb light? 

- Use your understanding of the splitting of d orbitals and the spectrochemical series to explain  
your results.

I.2- Solubility Equilibrium: Precipitates and Complexes of Silver(I) 

Background 
The  solubility  of  a  substance  in  a  solvent  is  defined  as  the  greatest  amount  that will  dissolve  in 
equilibrium  in  a  specified  volume  of  solvent  at  a  particular  temperature.    When  an  ionic  solid 
such  as  silver  chloride  (AgCl)  dissolves  in  water ,  it  breaks  up  into  ions  that  move  apart  from 
each  other  and  become  solvated  by  water  molecules,  and  the  following  equilibrium  is 
established: 

AgCl(s ) =  Ag+  (aq) + Cl  (aq ) 

The equilibrium constant for this reaction, or solubility product, Ksp, is given by:  
Ksp = [Ag+][Cl-]. 

A  simple  relation  exists  between  the  solubility  of  an  ionic  compound  (S)  and  its  solubility 
product: 

K  = S2 
sp

It can be easily shown that for the general solubility equilibrium 

A B (s) = nA m+ ( aq) + mBn ( aq)
n m 

the relation between the solubility and the solubility product is given by 

K = nn mm Sn +m 
sp 

The formation of coordination complexes can have a large effect on the solubility of a compound 
in water.  Silver chloride is only very weakly soluble in water, but addition of ammonia (NH3) to 
+ to form: 
the solution allows the complex ion Ag(NH3)2

( 
AgCl(s ) + 2 NH3 (aq )  Ag  NH3 )+ 
2 ( aq) + Cl  (aq )
=

This greatly increases the solubility of the silver chloride.

Safety:  Sulfide  salts,  their  solutions  and  hydrogen  sulfide  gas,  which  smells  like  rotten  eggs  at 
low  concentration  and  is  produced  by  reaction  of  sulfides  with  acids,  are  all  poisonous.  Avoid 
adding  any  acid  to  a  solution  containing  sulfide  salts.  Silver  nitrate  solutions  are  light  sensitive, 
irritating and oxidizing. Ammonium hydroxide is corrosive and highly irritating upon inhalation. 

Procedure: 
Place  a  50mL  beaker  containing  20 mL  of  distilled water  and  a magnetic  stirring  bar  on  the 
-
magnetic stirrer, and adjust the rate of stirring so it is vigorous but not turbulent. 
- Add about 1 mL of AgNO3 solution and allow time for complete mixing. 
- Add  dropwise  in  sequence  the  following  solutions  until  a  change  is  clearly  observed.   This 
will  generally  be  0.5-1.0 mL  (10-20  drops): NaHCO3, NaOH, NaCl, NH3, NaBr, Na2S2O3, 
KI, and Na2S.

Discussion: Silver forms a series of precipitates and complex  ions with different solubilities and 
formation constants, respectively. 
Interpret your results  in  terms of  solubility constants, complex formation constants, and relative

I.3- Equilibrium and temperature: Complexes of Cobalt (II) 

Background 
Chemical  reactions  are  either  endothermic  (taking  heat  from  the  surroundings)  or  exothermic 
(giving  off  heat).  The  effects  of  temperature  in  chemical  equilibrium  can  be  predicted  in  terms 
of Le ChÃ¢telier's principle.  If the reaction is endothermic, a raise in the temperature will shift the 
equilibrium to the right.  In an exothermic reaction, the shift occurs in the opposite direction. 
The  dependence  of  the  equilibrium  constant  on  the  temperature  is  given  by  the  van't  Hoff 
equation:

where HËš  is  the change  in enthalpy of  the reaction, R  the universal gas constant (8.31 J K-1mol Â­

Materials:

 12 mL 2-propanol, C3H7OH 
 distilled water 
 Test tube with stopper
 Hot water bath

Safety:    Cobalt  chloride  is  a  suspected  carcinogen  in  animals.    The  dust  is  a  respiratory  tract 
irritant.  Isopropanol is a flammable liquid and vapor (may cause a flash fire).  REMOVE stopper 
before heating  (never heat  a  closed  system).   When heating  the  testtube be  sure  it  is not pointed 
towards yourself or colleagues. 

Procedure: 
- Place 0.5g of CoCl2â€¢6H2O in a large test tube 
- Add 12 mL of 2-propanol 
- Stopper and shake to dissolve solid. Note the color of the solution. 
- Carefully add water dropwise, with mixing, until a color change is observed. 
- Place the unstoppered test tube in a boiling water bath. Observed any color change. 
- Transfer the test tube to an ice bath. Record your observations. 

Clean up: Discard the cobalt solution in the designated containers. 

Discussion:  Identify  the  colored  species.

I.4- Application of Solubility (Ksp) and Formation (Kf) Equilibria: Preparation 
of a Black and White Polaroid Negative. 

Background 
In early photographic processes salted papers were prepared by first floating the paper on a solution of 
KCl (or other halide) and then in the dark on a solution of AgNO3.  AgCl is precipitated into the paper 
fiber structure.  Today the silver halide is usually prepared in a gelatin layer.  The silver halide is then 
exposed to light to capture an image.  The image is obtained through the photochemical reduction of 
Ag+ to Ag metal.  The image can either be obtained through very long exposure times or a "latent" 
image can be further developed through the use of developing agents. To remove excess, unreacted 
silver halide from the paper or gelatin layer it must be made soluble.  This has been accomplished since 
the beginning of photography through use  of a "fixer"  sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3). 

This process relies heavily on solubility and precipitation processes governed by solubility equilibria 
(with equilibrium  constants know as Ksp.) as well as complex formation equilibria (with equilibrium 
constants represented by Kf  or ). 

Consider the solubility of AgCl.  What is the concentration of Ag+ in a saturated solution (i.e., there is 
solid present)?

The concentrations of the ions are very low in aqueous solution and whenever the concentrations 
of  the  ions  exceeds 1.3 x 10-5 M precipitation occurs  and  consequently unreacted  silver halide  is 
not readily removed by simple washing.

Coupling of two reactions permits pulling AgCl solid into solution and with sufficient washing in water 
to remove the products, the light sensitive silver halide is removed from the photographic image.  In 
reality there is a variety of soluble silver thiosulfate complexes formed. 

To prepare a negative to be used for obtaining a cyanotype print later in the course a Polaroid Land 
camera and Polaroid Polapan 665P/N will be used.  The chief advantage of this route to obtaining a 
negative is no darkroom is required to obtain a printable negative. 

Materials: 
Polaroid 220 Land Camera 
Polapan 665P/N (Polaroid Black and White Positive/Negative Instant Pack Film) 
Sodium sulfite solution 

Safety:    Wear  gloves  when  separating  the  film  pack  as  the  proprietary  chemical  mixture  is 
caustic. 

Procedure: 
You will be given  instruction on  use of  the  camera  to obtain  an  image  and on  the procedure  for 
developing  the  instant  pack  film.    The  negatives  are  washed  in  a  sodium  sulfite  solution  and 
rinsed  in  water.    A  final  rinse  in  a  proprietary  surfactant  solution  is  used  to  minimize  water 
spotting  on  the negative prior  to hanging  the negative  to dry.  To protect  the positive  image,  the 
black and white print must be coated with the coater provided with the film.
