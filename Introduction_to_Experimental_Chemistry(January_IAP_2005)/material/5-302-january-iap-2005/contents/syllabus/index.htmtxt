***** Overview *****
Welcome to 5.302!!! The goal of this course is to provide you with an
opportunity to integrate recently acquired theoretical concepts with the
experimental basis behind the discovery and development of these concepts. It
was designed as a "hands on" activity outside the classroom that will be both
"fun" and intellectually stimulating. It will give you a chance to see with
your own eyes what is usually described with equations in a textbook; to
experience the rate of a reaction in "real time"; to determine rather than just
calculate chemical equilibrium; to observe instead of just predicting the
outcome of a chemical reaction. In short, you will be allowed to make chemistry
happen with your own hands (protected by gloves), and right before your eyes
(or more precisely, goggles).
The experiments in this manual were selected such that the concepts they cover
are not buried under complicated laboratory techniques. Most of them involve
mixing solutions and observing the outcome. Nevertheless, the experiments are
progressively more challenging.
On the first day we will visit chemical equilibrium. We will study the
formation of different coordination compounds of nickel, analyze how
temperature affects the coordination chemistry of cobalt, and study the
solubility equilibrium of several silver compounds. This will be followed by a
practical application, the preparation of a black and white Polaroid negative.
On the second day we will focus on electrochemistry. Several processes that
involve electron transfer reactions, like plating, corrosion, and oxidation of
sugars will be examined along with the preparation of a cyanotype print (from
the previously prepared negative).
On the third day, we will study the kinetic mechanism of the reaction between
potassium iodide and potassium persulfate, a.k.a. the Iodine Clock Reaction.
Finally, we will take a look at a couple of organic compounds with interesting
properties, polymers and dyes, by synthesizing Nylon 6,10 (a commercial
polymer) and Methyl Orange (a common azo-dye and acid-base indicator).
All these experiments involve concepts that you have already studied in either
5.111, 5.112, 3.091, or your high-school chemistry class. Hopefully, Chemistry
5.302 will serve to strengthen and broaden your understanding of the concepts
studied in the aforementioned courses.
Welcome again, and thanks for joining us in this IAP experience.
