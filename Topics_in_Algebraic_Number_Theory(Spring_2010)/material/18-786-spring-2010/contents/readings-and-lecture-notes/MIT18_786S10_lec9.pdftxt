ALGEBRAIC  NUMBER  THEORY 

LECTURE  9  NOTES 

1.  Secton  4.4 
Proof  of  theorem  1:  the  bound  on  α  should be  α  ≥ 2n−r1 (1/2π)r2 |d|1/2 . 
2.  Section  4.6 

Solving  the  Brahmagupta-Pell-Fermat  equation: 
Write  the  continued  fraction  expansion  of  √d  as [a0 , a1 , . . . , ak , 2a0 ].  Then  the 
smallest  solution  to 

x 2  − dy 2  =  ±1 
is (a, b) where  a/b  = [a0 , a1 , . . . , ak ]. 
When  d  ≡ 2  or  3  mod  4,  this  gives  a  fundamental  unit  for  Q(√d).  When 
d  ≡ 1  mod  4,  this  gives  either  the  fundamental  unit  or  its  cube,  and  one  can 
easily  check  whether  a  cube  root  exists  in  Q(√d). 
For  a  treatment  of  continued  fractions  see  the  book  by  Niven  and  Zuckerman. 

3.  Section  4.7 

Proof  of  proposition  1:  If  A  is  an  integral  domain  and  K  =  F rac(A)  has 
characteristic  0,  then  Samuel  asserts  that  K  is  a  ﬁnite  dimensional  vector  space 
over  Q.  Note  that  this  uses  that  A  is  integral  over  Z  (being a  ﬁnitely  generated 
module over  Z which is also a ring), which  then implies that  K  =  QA  ∼ Q ⊗Z A.
