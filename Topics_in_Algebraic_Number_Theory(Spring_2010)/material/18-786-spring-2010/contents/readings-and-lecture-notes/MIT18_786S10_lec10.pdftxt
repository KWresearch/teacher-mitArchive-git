Example  (Rings  of  fractions).  Let  A  be  an  integral  domain. 

(1)  If  S  =  A\{0},  we  get  the  entire  ﬁeld  of  fractions  of  A. 
(2)  If  S  =  {1, x, x2 , . . .  },  we  get  the  localization  Ax  =  {a/xn  :  a  ∈ A, n  ≥ 0}
of  A  in  x.  For  instance,  if  A  =  Z  and  x  =  p  a  prime,  we  get  rational 
numbers whose denominators are powers of  p. Note that in this particular 
case,  we  will  not  call  the  ring  Zp ,  because  of  possible  confusion  with  the 
p-adic  integers,  which  is  a  completely  diﬀerent  ring. 
(3)  If  S  =  A\p,  where  p  is  a prime ideal  of  A,  we  get  the  localization  of  A  in 
6∈  p}.  For  instance,  if  A  =  Z, p = (p) then  we  get 
p,  Ap  =  {a/s  :  a  ∈ A, s 
S −1A  =  {a/b  :  p 6 | b} ⊂ Q. 
Example  (Primes  in  rings  of  fractions).  The  primes  of  S −1A  are  in  bijective 
correspondence  with  primes  of  A  not intersecting  A.  For  example,  if  A  =  Z  and 
S  =  {2m3n  :  m, n  ≥ 0}, then (2)  and (3)  are not primes in  S −1A  any  more,  since 
they  equal  the  unit ideal.  But (p) is  still  a  prime  in  S −1A  for  p = 2, 3. 

Localization (the process  of taking  rings of fractions)  commutes  with taking 
quotients,  in  the  following  sense: 
Proposition  1.  If  S  ∩ a =  φ  then 
S −1A 
aS −1A  ∼
=  S 
where  S  is  the  image  of  S  in  A/a.

Localization also commutes with completion in the following  sense:  recallt that 
if  A  is  a  Dekekind  domain  with  fraction  ﬁeld  K ,  and  pa  prime  ideal  of  A, then 
p  deﬁnes  a  valuation  of  K  by 

|x|p  =  c −vp (x) 
where  c >  1  is  any  real  number,  and  vp(x)  is  the  power  of  p  dividing  the  ideal 
(x) (diﬀerent  choices  of c  give  equivalent  valuations).

p  is  Ap, the localization of  A  in 
Then the valuation ring  of  K  with  respect to

p.  This  is  a  DVR.  The  completion  of  K  is  K� ,  say,  and  the  valuation  ring  of  K� is 
the  completion  A� of  A  with  respect  to  | |p,  which  is  the  same  as  the  completion 
of  A .p
p  ∼ A� ∼ ( � pA
So we have  A� = =  A) b, the last isomorphism following from the fact that 
any  element  of  A�\pA� is  a  unit,  so  localization  doesn’t  aﬀect  anything. 
Example.  The  completion  of  Z(p)  =  {a/b  :  p 6 | b} is just  Zp ,  the  p-adic integers, 
the  completion  of  Z  with  respect  to  the  p-adic  valuation

p .

2.  Section  5.2 

The  following  proposition,  which  we  will  prove  next  time,  is  very  useful  for 
studying  the  decomposition  of  primes  in  number  ﬁelds. 

Proposition  2.  Let  A  be  a  Dedekind  domain  with  fraction  ﬁeld  K .  Let  L/K 
be  a  ﬁnite  separable  extension,  and  B  the  integral  closure  of  A  in  L.  Assume  B 
is  monogenic  over  A,  i.e.  B  =  A[α]  for  some  α  ∈ B .  Then  let  f (X )  ∈ A[X ] 
be  the  minimal  polynomial  of  α  over  K .  Let  p  be  a  prime  of  A  and let  f  be  the 
reduction  of  f  mod  p.  If  f  factors  as 
f [X ] =  P 1(X )e1  . . .  P r (X )er 
where  P1 , . . . , Pr  ∈ (A/p)[X ] are  irreducible  and  monic,  then 
pB  =  Be
er 
1  . . .  Br
1 
where  Bi  =  pB  +  Pi (α)B ,  the  ramiﬁcation  index  of  Bi  is  ei ,  and  the  residue 
degree  of  Bi  is  fi  = deg P i . 
Example.  Let  K  =  Q(√2).  You  showed  on  the  homework  that  OK  =  Z[√2].

So  OK  is  monogenic  over  Z,  and  we  can  use  this  to  compute  the  decomposition 
of  integer  primes,  using  the  above  proposition  with  α  =  √2.  The  minimal 
3
polynomial  of  α  is  X 3  − 2.  It’s  reduction  mod  5  factors  as 
X 3  − 2  ≡ (X  + 2)(X 2  − 2X  − 1)  mod 5 
So  the  prime  5  =  p1p2  with  e(p1) = 1, f (p1) = 1, e(p2) = 1, f (p2) = 2.  Modulo 2 
the  polynomial  reduces  to  X 3 ,  so  2  factors  as  p 3 ,  where  p = (α). 

Now  most extensions  of  number  ﬁelds  L/K  do not have a ring of integers that’s 
monogenic.  Nevertheless,  it  turns  out  that  the  localizations  are  monogenic  at 
all  but  ﬁnitely  many  primes: 
if  we  choose  α  ∈ OL  such  that  K (α) =  L,  then 
Z[α]p  = (OL )p  for all but  ﬁnitely  many primes  p ⊂ OK  (and we can say  what this 
exceptional ﬁnite subset is)  . This enables us to study prime decomposition rather 
eﬀectively,  since the prime decomposition  above  p  is  not  aﬀected  by  localizing  at 
p.
