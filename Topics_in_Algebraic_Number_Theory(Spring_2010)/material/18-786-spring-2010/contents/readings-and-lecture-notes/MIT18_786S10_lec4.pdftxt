ALGEBRAIC  NUMBER  THEORY 

LECTURE  4  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES 

Material  covered:  Sections  2.6  through  2.9  of  textbook. 

I followed the book pretty  closely  in this lecture,  so  only  a few  comments. 
Wherever  Samuel  states  a  theorem  with  the  assumption  that  a  ﬁeld  has  char­
acteristic  zero  or  is  ﬁnite,  we  can  generalize  to  the  ﬁeld  being  perfect. 

1.  Section  2.6 

 

To  compute  the  determinant  of  the  matrix

. . . 
ﬁrst  add  X  times the bottom row to the second last  row, then  X  times the second 
last  row  to  the  third  last,  and  so  on.  We  get 
⎞
⎛
. . .  X n  +  an−1X  +

0  −1 
. . . 
Now  Laplace  expand  along  the  ﬁrst  column,  and  so  on,  to  get  that  the  determi­
nant is  f (X ),  the  minimal  polynomial  of  x,  which  is  the  top  right  entry  of  the 
above  matrix. 
Example.  Suppose  A  ⊂ B  ⊂ C  are  rings,  such  that  B  is  a  free  module  over  A 
and  C  is  a  free  module  over  B .  Let  x  ∈ C . Show that 
charpolyB [X ]/A[X ] charpolyC/B (x) =  charpolyC/A (x) 

 

Note  that  this  is  using  that  B [X ]  is  a  free  A[X ]  module.  In  particular,  check 
that  this  implies  that  traces  and  norms  of  elements  are  transitive. 

2.  Appendix:  the  fundamental  theorem  of  algebra 

Let’s  see  a  slightly diﬀerent proof from that in the book (it’s from Grillet’s 
Abstract Algebra).

LECTURE  4  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES 

We  will  use  that  any  polynomial  of  odd  degree  over  R  has  a  real  root,  and 
that  any  element  of  C  has  a  square  root.  These  are  elementary  to  see:  for  the 
ﬁrst  look  at  the  values  of  f (x) as  x  →  +∞ and  as  x  → −∞,  and  observe  that 
there  must  be  a  sign  change  in  between.  For  the  second,  we  can  write  z  =  reiθ 
and  then  √re
iθ/2
is  a  square  root. 
Now if  K  is  an  extension  of  R  of  ﬁnite  odd  degree,  it  must  equal  R  (for there 
is  a primitive  element  α,  and its  minimal polynomial is  of  odd degree  and  so has 
a  root  in  R,  so  R[α] ∼ R.= 
Let  L  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  C,  which  we  can  assume  is  Galois  over  R  (else 
replace  L  by its Galois or normal  closure).  Then let  G  = Gal (L/R) be its Galois 
group.  If  G2  is  a  2-Sylow  subgroup  of  G,  then  the  ﬁxed  ﬁeld  of  G2  is  an  odd 
degree  extension  of  R,  so  it  must  equal  R.  So  G  is  a 2-group (i.e. 
it has  order 
a  power  of  2),  and  so  is  the  subgroup  Gal (L/C).  By  the  Sylow  theorems,  if 
Gal (L/C)  is  non-trivial,  it  has  a  subgroup  of  index  2,  whose  ﬁxed  ﬁeld  is  a 
quadratic  extension  of  C,  which  is  impossible.  So  L  =  C.
