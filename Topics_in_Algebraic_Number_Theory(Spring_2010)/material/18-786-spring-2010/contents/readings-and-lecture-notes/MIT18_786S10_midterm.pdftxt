18.786 Midterm Exam 

April  1,  2010 

Solve  two  out  of  these  three  problems.  Justify  your  answers: 
for  instance,  saying  that  a  high-level  gp 
function  (such  as  bnfclgp())  outputs  the  answer  you  give  is  not  enough  justiﬁcation.  You  may  use  gp 
without  justiﬁcation  to  do  elementary  calculations  such  as  computing  the  discriminant  of  a  polynomial, 
determinant  of  a  matrix,  doing  arithmetic  modulo  primes  or  a  polynomial,  etc. 
You  may  use results proved in  class, lecture  notes, or the problem sets.  You are not  allowed  to google/wiki 
search  for  answers. 

1.  Let  f (x) =  x3  +  x  − 4,  and  K  =  Q[x]/(f (x)) be  the  number  ﬁeld  obtained  by  adjoining  a  root  α  of  f . 

(a)  Find  out  the  number  of  real  and  complex  embeddings  of  K . 

(b)  Show  that  OK  =  Z[α]. 

(c)  Find  out  how  the  primes  2, 3, 5 factor in  K . 

(d)  Calculate  the  class  group  of  K . 

2.  Let  p  be  a  prime. 

(a)  Describe  and  count  all  the  (ﬁnitely  many,  by  homework)  quadratic  extensions  of  Qp  (e.g.  by 
describing polynomials  f (x) such  that  the  extension  is  Qp [X ]/(f (x))).  Describe  the  ramiﬁcation 
behaviour  of  p  in  each  of  these  extensions. 

(b)  Recall that the valuation on Qp  extends uniquely to any ﬁnite extension, and hence to the algebraic 
closure  Qp .  Show  that  Qp  is  not  a  complete  ﬁeld  for  this  valuation. 

3.  Let  g (x) =  x4  + 18x2 + 2,  and  K  =  Q[x]/(g (x)) be  the  number  ﬁeld  obtained  by  adjoining  a  root  α  of 
g . 

(a)  Compute  the  number  of  real  and  complex  embeddings  of  K ,  and  the  rank  of  the  unit  group  of 
OK . 

(b)  Compute  the  torsion  part  of  the  units.  (Hint:  if ζn  ∈  K ,  compare  the  primes  which  ramify  in  K 
and in  Q(ζn ).) 

(c)  Describe an explicit non-torsion unit.  (Hint:  ﬁnd a real quadratic subﬁeld  of  K .)
