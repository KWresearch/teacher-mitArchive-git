1.  Ideal  class  groups  of  quadratic  fields 
These  are  the  ideal  class  groups  of  the  Dedekind  domains  OK  for quadratic 
ﬁelds  K .  We  already  saw  that  we  can  have  examples  of  non-PIDs  even  for 
quadratic  ﬁelds.  For  instance,  a  homework  problem  is  to  show  that  the  class 
group  of  Z[√−m] (  =  OQ(√−m)  if  −m  ≡  2  or  3  mod  4)  is  nontrivial  for  m 
squarefree  and  composite. 
Gauss  conjecture:  Let  h(d) be  the  class  number  of  Q(√d).  Then  h(d) → ∞ 
as  d  → −∞.  In  particular,  there  are  only  ﬁnitely  many  ﬁelds  with  a  given  class 
number. 
The class number 1 problem is to ﬁnd  all  the imaginary quadratic  ﬁelds whose 
ring  of  integers  are  PIDs.  Heilbronn  (1934)  proved  the  Gauss  conjecture  and 
showed  that there were at most 10 imaginary quadratic  ﬁelds with  class number 
one.  Nine  of  them  correspond  to  d  =  −3, −4, −7, −8, −11, −19, −43, −67, −163 
and  conjecturally  there was no tenth.  This  was proved by Heegner in 1952  using 
modular forms (Stark  and Birch in the 1960s clariﬁed Heegner’s proof  which  was 
not  believed  at  ﬁrst).  An  independent  proof  was  given  by  Baker  in  1966  using 
transcendental  number  theory. 
(Baker  won  the  Fields  medal  for  his  work  on 
linear  forms  in  logarithms,  which  provides  the  basis  for  many  explicit  methods 
in  diophantine  equations).  Goldfeld’s  work  in  1985  connected  the  class  number 
problem  to  L-functions  of  elliptic  curves,  and  reduced  it  to  a  ﬁnite  computation 
in  principle,  for  any  given  n. 
π√163 
The  discriminants  above  are  quite  special,  for  instance  notice  that  e
is 
almost  an integer (6403202 + 744  + error of less than 10−12), and that  x2 + x + 41 
which has discriminant  −163, is prime for  x  = 0, 1, . . . ,  39. 
For  real  quadratic  ﬁelds,  much  less  is  known:  for  instance,  it  is  not  known  if 
class  number  one  happens  inﬁnitely  often.  Cohen-Lenstra  heuristics  are  some 
precise  conjectures  which  predict,  for  instance,  that  more  than  75%  of  real  qua­
dratic  ﬁelds  will  have  class  number  1.

2.1.  Valuations.  Let  K  be  a  ﬁeld.  An  absolute  value  or  valuation  on  K  is  a 
R  such that 
function

:  K 
→
(1)  |x| ≥ 0  for  all  x  ∈ K ,  with  equality  iﬀ  x  = 0. 
(2)  |xy | =  |x||y | for  all  x, y  ∈ K . 
(3)  |x  +  y | ≤ |x| +  |y | for  all  x, y  ∈ K  (the triangle inequality). 
We  say  that 
is  a  non-archimedean  valuation  iﬀ in  addition to (1)  and (2),

satisﬁes the  stronger inequality (than (3))  |x + y | ≤ max(|x|, |y |).  Else  we  say  | |
is  archimedean. 
. Now let’s deﬁne  | |p  by  ��pk a �� =  p−k  if  k  ∈ Z  and  a, b | |are  not  divisible 
which  we  shall

by  p.  So  p p  = 1/p and  a p  = 1 if  p  doesn’t divide  a.  It  is  easy  to  check  that

p  is  a  non-archimedean  valuation  on  Q:  the triangle inequality just says that

Remark.  For  any  ﬁeld,  there  is  a  trivial  valuation given by  x = 1 if  x  =  0,  and 
| |
|0| = 0.  From  now  on  we  shall  exclude  the  trivial  valuation. 
Remark.  For  any  valuation,  |1| =  | − 1| =  1.  For  we  have  |1| =  |1 ·  1| =  |1|2 ,  so 
|1| = 0 or 1.  The former cannot hold by property (1).  Similarly  it’s easy  to show 
| − 1| = 1. 
Lemma 1.  Let  | | be  a  valuation  of  a  ﬁeld  K . Let  n  ∈ K  be the element  1+ · · ·+ 1 
(n  times).  Then 
is  nonarchimedean  iﬀ  n  is bounded.

Proof.  Suppose  | | is  nonarchimedean.  Then  |1| = 1, |1 + 1| ≤ max(|1|, |1|) = 1 
and by  induction  |n| ≤ 1  for  all  n.  Now  suppose  |n| ≤ N  for  some  N  ∈ R. Then

Taking  n’th  roots  and  letting  n  → ∞ we get  |x  +  y | ≤ |x| = max(|x|, |y |). 
We  say  the  valuations

⇐⇒ | |
x 2  <  1, for

lemma,  |n| ≤ 1  for  all  positive  integers  n.  Since  the  valuation  is  nontrivial  and 
| − 1| = 1,  we  must  have  |n| <  1 for some  n  (else by multiplicativity, the absolute 
value  of  every  nonzero  rational  number  would  be  1).  The  smallest  such  n  is 
clearly  a prime,  say  p. Now if  q  =  p  is  another  prime,  then  ap  + bq  = 1  for  some 
integers  p.  So  |b||q | =  |1 − ap| =  1  by  the  remark  above.  Since  |b| ≤ 1,  we  have 
|q | ≥ 1  and  so  |q | =  1.  So  the  valuation  of  every  prime  other  than  p  is  1,  and 
must  be  equivalent  to

Deﬁnition 1.  An exponential  valuation  v  of  K  is a function  v  :  K ×  =  K \{0} → 
R  such that 
(1)  v (xy ) =  v (x) + v (y ). 
(2)  v (x  +  y ) ≥ min(v (x), v (y )). 
We an extend  to all  of  K  by deﬁning  v (0) =  ∞. Note that  c−v(x)  for any  c >  1 
deﬁnes  a  nonarchimedean  valuation  of  K . 
v (K ) is a discrete  subgroup of  R (hence ∼ Z 
We say  v  is a  discrete  valuation  if 
=
as  a  group). 
We  say  that  a  discrete  valuation  is  normalized  if  v (K ) =  Z,  i.e.  the  smallest 
positive  value  of  v  is 1. 

Example.  vp (x) =  − log |x|p  deﬁnes  a  normalized  discrete  valuation.  vp (x) is 
p 
nothing  but  the  highest  power  of  p  dividing  x.

LECTURE  6  NOTES 

If  v  is a normalized discrete valuation of  K , then we let  o =  {x  ∈ K | v (x) ≥ 0}
be the  valuation  ring  of  v ,  and  p =  {x  ∈ K | v (x) ≥ 1} be the  prime  associated 
to  v .  It  is  easy  to  check  that  p  is  maximal  and  then  o/p  is  a  ﬁeld,  the  residue 
ﬁeld  of  v . 
Let  π  ∈ o  be  any  element  of  o  with  v (π) =  1.  Then  for  any  x  ∈ K ×  we have 
x  =  πny  for  some  integer  n  and  some  y  with  v (y ) =  0,  i.e.  y  ∈ o×  is  a  unit  of 
o. So  o  is  in  fact  a  PID  with  unique  maximal  ideal  p which is principal,  equal  to 
(π).  Such  an  element  π  is  called  a  uniformizer  of  o  (or  of v ). 
Such  a  ring  o,  which  comes  from  a  discrete  valuation  of  a  ﬁeld  K ,  is  called  a 
discrete  valuation  ring,  or  DVR  for  short. 

2.2.  Completions.  We’ll  now  construct  the  p-adic  numbers. 
Let  | | be  an  absolute  value  on  a  ﬁeld  K .  We  say  a  sequence  {an} of  elements 
of  K  is  a  Cauchy  sequence  of  for  all  ǫ >  0,  there  is  an  N  such  that  m, n  ≥ N 
an < ǫ.  Recall  that  the  ﬁeld  R  is  constructed  from  Q  as  the 
implies 
|am  − |
set  of Cauchy  sequences (for the  usual  archimedean  valuation)  modulo the  null 
sequences,  i.e.  those  which  tend  to  zero.  We  will  imitate  that  construction  for 
an  arbitrary  absolute  value. 
Let 
C = Cauchy  sequences  =  {{an}n∈N  | ∀ǫ >  0, ∃N  such that  m, n  ≥ N  ⇒ |am−an | < ǫ} 
and 
M = Null  sequences  =  {{an}n∈N  | ∀ǫ >  0, ∃N  such that  m  ≥ N  ⇒ |am | < ǫ} 
Then  C is  a  ring  under  componentwise  addition  and  multiplication.  The  ﬁeld 
K  embeds inside  C by  taking  x  ∈ K  to  the  constant  sequence  {x, x, . . .  }.  The 
�
subset  M is a maximal ideal  of  C (check!)  and  so  C /M =  K  is  a  ﬁeld  containing 
| |
. We will make some observations 
K , called the completion of  K  with  respect to 
before  we  describe  the  structure  of  K� a  little  more  explicitly. 
First  note  that  the  valuation  extends  to  K� by deﬁning  |{an}| = limn→∞  |an |. 
The  limit  exists  because  we  have  from  the  triangle  inequality  that  am

|am  − an | and  similarly  −(|am | − |an |) ≤ |am  − an |, so that  ||am | − |an || ≤ |am  − an |. 
Therefore  {|an |} is  a  Cauchy  sequence  of  real  numbers,  so  it  converges.  Check 
that the extension satisﬁes the properties of  a valuation.  This extension is unique 
in  the  following  sense:  the  valuation 
| |
makes  K  into  a  metric  space,  and  for 
any  metric space  X ,  there  is  a  unique  metric  space  Xˆ which is complete and into 
which  X  embeds  isometrically  as  a  dense  subspace.  So  the  metric  and  hence  the 
valuation  on  K� is forced. 
is  nonarchimedean,  corresponding  to  an  exponential 
From  now  on  assume 
| |
valuation  v .  Let  ˆv  be  the  extension  of  v  to  K� as  above. 
Lemma  2.  Let  {an} be  a  Cauchy  sequence  in  K  converging  to  an  element  dif­
ferent from  0.  Then  limn→∞  |an | =  |am | for  m  large  enough.

Proof.  Let 0  < r  = limn→∞  |an |.  Choose  ǫ <  r/2.  Let  N  be  large  enough  such 
that  |am | > r  − ǫ  for  m  ≥ N  and  also  such  that  |am  − an | < ǫ  for  m, n  ≥ N . 
Then  |am | >  |an  − am | and  so  |an | =  |am |,  for  all  n  ≥ m  ≥ N .  So  the  sequence 
of  an is  constant  beyond  n  =  N ,  and  therefore  equals  the  limit  r .  Hence

|
� 
|am | =  r  = limn→∞  |an | for  m  ≥ N . 
Corollary 1.  The  value  group  vˆ(K� ) of  K� ,  equals  that  of  K .
