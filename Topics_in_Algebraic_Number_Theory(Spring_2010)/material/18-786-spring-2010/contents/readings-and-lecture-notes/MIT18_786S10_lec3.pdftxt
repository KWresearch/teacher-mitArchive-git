Material  covered:  Sections  2.1  through  2.5  of  textbook. 

1.  Section  2.1 

Proof  of Theorem 1, (b) 

⇒

(c): Once we have the system of equations, 

(x I  − C )y  = 0
· 
where  C  = (aij ), we can multiply the matrix  x I − C  by its adjoint, which  results 
·
in the scalar matrix  d I  = (det(x I − C ))I  multiplying  y  to give the zero vector. 
·
· 
This implies  dyi  = 0  for  all  i  and  then  d  = 0  as  in  the  book. 

Example.  Let  K  be  a  number  ﬁeld.  Then  any  x  ∈ K  is  algebraic  over  Q.  It 
satisﬁes  a  unique  monic  polynomial  equation  of  smallest  degree 

x n  +  an−1x n−1  +

+  a1x  +  a0  = 0

· · · 
with  ai  ∈ Q.  If  all  the  coeﬃcients  ai  are  integers,  we  say  that  x  in  an  algebraic 
integer.  The  ring  of  algebraic  integers  of  K  is  called  OK . 
Example.  The  algebraic  number  √3 is an  algebraic integer,  since it  satisﬁes  x −
2
3  = 0.  But (1 + √3)/2  is  not  an  algebraic  integer,  since  its  minimal  polynomial 
is 2x − 2x  − 1.  On the  other hand  the Golden  ratio (1 +  √5)/2  is  an  algebraic 
2
integer.  Its  minimal  polynomial  is  x2  − x  − 1. 
Proof  of  Proposition  3:  Here  is  an  alternate  proof  of  the  ﬁrst  part: 
if  B  is 
b  ∈ B  satisfy  the 
integral  over  A  and  A  is  a  ﬁeld,  then  B  is  a  ﬁeld.  Let 0  =6
following  equation  of  minimal  degree  over  A: 

· · · 
We  can  assume  that  a0  =  0  else  we  can  factor  out  b  and  cancel  it  to  get  a  lower 
degree,  since  B  is  an  integral  domain.  Then  we  have 

+  a0  = 0

bn  +  an−1 bn−1  +

so that  −a −1 (bn−1  +
0 

· · · 

b(bn−1  +

+  a1 ) = 

−a0 
· · · 
+  a1 ) is  a  multiplicative  inverse  for  b.

2.  Section  2.2 

Example 2.2 is a special  case  of  the  Gauss lemma: Every  UFD (unique factor­
ization  domain,  or  factorial  ring,  in  Samuel’s  terminology)  is  integrally  closed. 
The  proof  is  the  same  as  in  the  book,  word  for  word. 

3.  Section  2.3 
Example.  Here  is  an  example  where  K  ⊂ R, x  ∈ R  is  integral  over  K  but  k [x] is 
not an integral domain (or equivalently  a  ﬁeld, in this situation). 
Let  R  ⊂ M2 (K ) (the 2 × 2  matrices  over  K ) be  K [x],  where

M2 (K ) as scalar  matrices.  The  minimal polynomial  of  x  is  easily  seen 
֒Kand 
→
to be  X 2  − 1,  which  is  not  irreducible.  Here  K [x] is  a  direct  sum  of  two  copies 
of  K ,  as  an  algebra  over  K . 

x  = 

4.  Section  2.4 

We  say  a  ﬁeld  K  is  perfect  if  every  algebraic  extension  of  K  is  separable  over 
K .  In  other  words,  any  monic  irreducible  polynomial  over  K  splits  over  K  into 
a  product  of  distinct  monic  linear  factors. 

Example.  Any  ﬁeld  of  characteristic  0,  or  any  ﬁnite  ﬁeld,  is  perfect. 

Example.  An  example  of  a  non-perfect  ﬁeld  is  K  =  Fp(T ).  The  polynomial 
X p  − T 
is  irreducible  over  K ,  but  over  the  extension  K (T 1/p ) =  Fp (T 1/p ),  it 
splits  as (X  − T 1/p )p ,  so  it  has  multiple  roots. 
Theorem  1  (Theorem  of primitive  element).  Let  K  be  a  perfect  ﬁeld,  and  L/K 
a  ﬁnite  extension.  Then  ∃x  ∈ L  such  that  L  =  K [x]. 

5.  Section  2.5 

A  number  ﬁeld  is  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Q.  Number  ﬁelds  are  labelled  by  their 
degree:  quadratic  if  they  have  degree  2  over  Q,  cubic,  quartic,  quintic  and  so 
on.  If  K  is  a  number  ﬁeld,  we  let  OK  be  the  ring  of  integers  of  K ,  which  is  the 
integral  closure  of  Z  in  K . 
Note that for quadratic  ﬁelds, we see by  the explicit description of  OK  that it 
is  a  free  Z-module  of  rank [K  :  Q].  In  fact  this  is  true  for  any  number  ﬁeld.  A 
subring  of  OK  of  rank [K  :  Q] over  Z  is  called  an  order.

6.  GP  example 

f  =  x^3  +  3*x  +  1; 
F  =  bnfinit(f); 
charpoly(Mod(x^2,f)); 

The  last  command  computes  the  characteristic  polynomial  of  α2 ,  where  α  is  a 
root  of  f . 

a  =  sqrt(3)  +  sqrt(2) 
algdep(a,4) 

This  command produces a best possible  approximation to a minimal polynomial 
of  the  speciﬁed  degree.  To  set  the  precision  in  gp,  use 

default(realprecision,100);
