Remark.  The  non-archimedean  topology:  Recall  that  if  K  is  a  ﬁeld  with  a  val­
uation  | |,  then  it  also  is  a  metric  space  with  d(x, y ) =  |x  −  y |.  The  topology 
has  a  basis  of  open  neighborhoods  given  by  B (x, ǫ) =  {y  ∈  K | |x  − y | < ǫ}.  If 
the  valuation  is  nonarchimedean,  then  this  metric  space  or  topology  is  rather 
bizarre.  For  instance,  the  open  balls  don’t  have  a  unique  center: 
in  fact,  if  we 
take  any  y  ∈  B (x, ǫ), then y  is  a  center  of  the  ball  as  well,  i.e.  B (x, ǫ) =  B (y , ǫ)! 
To  see  this,  use  the  strong  triangle  inequality 

d(z , x) < ǫ  and  d(y , x) < ǫ  ⇒  d(z , x) < ǫ 

so  that  B (x, ǫ)  ⊂  B (y , ǫ)  and  similarly,  B (y , ǫ)  ⊂  B (x, ǫ).  Note  that  the  set 
D(x, ǫ) =  {y  ∈  K | |x − y | ≤ ǫ} is a closed  set, but it is not  necessarily  the closure 
of  B (x, ǫ) (see  the  next  remark). 

Remark.  If  the  norm is discrete  as  well  as  nonarchimedean, then things get  even 
stranger.  Suppose  |x|  =  c−v(x)  for  some  c >  1  and  a  normalized  exponential 
valuation  v .  Then  the  set  B (x, ǫ)  can  be  identiﬁed  with  {y  ∈  K | v (x  −  y )  > 
− logc (ǫ)}.  Since  the  valuation  is  discrete  and  integer-valued,  it’s  easy  to  see 
that  v (x  −  y )  >  − logc (ǫ)  is  equivalent  to  v (x  −  y )  ≥  ⌊− logc (ǫ) + 1⌋  =  δ , 
say.  Therefore  B (x, ǫ) =  D(x, δ )  is  closed.  Hence  K  is  disconnected,  and  the 
same  argument  shows  that  any  subspace  of  K  containing  more than  one point is 
disconected.  In  other  words,  K  is totally  disconnected. 

Proposition 1.  Let  K  be  a  ﬁeld  with  a  discrete  valuation  v ,  and  o  its  valuation 
ring,  p  the  maximal  ideal.  Let  K� be  the  completion  of  K  with  respect  to  v  and 
ˆ p  the  valuation  ring  and  maximal  ideal  of  ˆ Then  ˆ p  ∼ o/p  (and in fact, 
o, ˆ
o/ˆ = 
v . 
ˆ pr  ∼ o/pr  for  r  ≥  1). 
o/ˆ = 
Proof.  We  have  a  map  o →  oˆ →  ˆo/pˆ and  the  kernel  of  this  composition  consists 
of  all  elements  x  of  o  which  are  in  p,  so  those  which  have  ˆv  =  v (x)  ≥  1. 
In 
p  and  we  just  need  to  see  that  the

other  words,  the  kernel  is  p.

x  ∈  ˆo  be the (limit  of )  the  sequence  {an} in  K .  Now

map  is  surjective.  Let  0
 = 
because 1  ≥  limn→∞  |an | =  |am | for  m  large  enough,  it  follows  that  the  sequence 
an  eventually lies in  o.  Now  choose  N  large  enough  such  that  v (an  −  aN )  ≥  1 
for  n  ≥  N .  Then  x  =  aN  +  y  where  y  = lim(an  −  aN ) lies in  pˆ, by deﬁnition.

Therefore  ˆo =  o + pˆ proving  the  surjectivity.  A  similar  proof  works  for  the  more 
� 
general  statement. 
Example.  If  we  start  with  K  =  Q  with its  p-adic  valuation  vp (x) =  power  of  p 
dividing  x,  then  the  completion  is  called  the  ﬁeld  of  p-adic  numbers  Qp .  Any 
nonzero  element  Qp  can  be  written  as  an  inﬁnite  convergent  series  pk (a0 + a1p + 
a2p2  +  . . .  ),  with k  ∈  Z  and  a0 , a1 , ·  ·  ·  ∈ {0, 1, . . . , p  − 1}. 

More  generally,  we  have  the  following  description. 

= 

Proposition 2.  Let  R  ⊂  o  be  a  system  of  representatives  for  κ  =  o/p,  which  is 
6 x  ∈  ˆ
usual ly  taken to include  0  for  convenience.  Then  every  0 
= 
K  has  a  unique 
representation  as  a  convergent  series 
x  =  πm (a0  +  a1π  +  a2π 2  +  . . .  ) 
Z. 
0, m  ∈

where  ai  ∈  R, a0  6
Proof.  Since  π  is  also  a  uniformizer  of  the  DVR  ˆo, let  x  =  πmu,  where  u  ∈  ˆo ∗  . 
Since  ˆo/pˆ ∼ o/p,  the  class  u  mod  pˆ has  a  unique  representative  a0  ∈  R, a0  6= 0. 
= 
So  u  =  a0  +  πb1 ,  with  b1  ∈  ˆo.  Assume  by  induction  we  have 
u  =  a0  +  a1π  +  a2π 2  +  · · ·  +  an−1πn−1  +  πn bn 
with  bn  ∈  ˆo,  and  let  an  be  the  representative  in  R  of  the  residue  class  of  bn 
mod  ˆp  to  continue.  So  we  get  � 
aiπ i  which  is  easily  seen  to  be  convergent  and 
� 
unique. 
Remark.  The  valuation  ring  Zp  of  Qp  can  be  thought  of  as  the  collection  of  all 
the  Z/pnZ  together.  Any  element  of  Zp  determines  a  compatible  collection  of 
elements  of  Z/pnZ  and  vice  versa.  In  formal  terminology,  Zp  is the inverse limit 
of the  Z/pnZ.  Note  that,  for  instance,  every  prime  q  =6
p  is invertible in  Zp ; in 
fact,  it  is  already  invertible  in  the  valuation  ring  of  Q  with  respect  to  | |p . 
The  completion  Kˆ of  K  with  respect  to  the  discrete  valuation  v  is  a  complete 
metric space.  We say that a  ﬁeld  K  is a complete discretely  valued  ﬁeld  (or CDVF 
for  short)  if  it  is  complete  with  respect  to  the  discrete  valuation  speciﬁcied. 

Exercise.  Two  valuations  are  equivalent  iﬀ  they  deﬁne  the  same  topology  on  K . 

Example.  In  Qp ,  a  basis  of  neighborhoods  of  0  is  given  by  pnZp , n  ∈  Z.  These 
get  smaller  as  n  increases. 

Lemma  1.  Let  K  be  a  CDVF  such  that  κ  =  o/p  is  ﬁnite.  Then  o  is  compact 
and  K  is  local ly  compact. 

Proof.  For  a  metric  space,  compactness  is  equivalent  to  sequential  compactness. 
So let  {an} be  a  sequence  in  o. Write 
an  =  an0  +  an1π  +  an2π 2  +  . . .

for  every  n,  where  ani  are  elements  of  a  system  of  representatives  R  ⊂  o  of  κ, 
which  is  ﬁnite.  Since  the  values  taken  by  the  sequence  {an0}n≥q  lie  in  a  ﬁnite 
′ 
set  R,  some  value  must  be  taken  inﬁnitely  often,  say  by  some  subsequence  {an}

where  an  =  af (n)  for  some  increasing  function  n.  Then  looking  at  the  values  an1

will  converge,  and  it  is  a  subsequence  of  the  original  sequence. 

Example.  In particular,  Zp  is  compact  and  Qp  is  locally  compact. 

Deﬁnition 1.  Let  Kp  be  the  completion  of  a  number  ﬁeld  K  with  respect  to  the 
nonarchimedean  valuation  vp  corresponding  to  a  prime  p  of  the  ring  of  integers 
OK .  (Recal l  that  vp(x)  is  the  power  of  p  dividing  the  principal  fractional  ideal 
(x)  if  0 =6 x  ∈  K .)  These  ﬁelds  Kp  are  cal led  nonarchimedean  local  ﬁelds. 
The  archimedean  local  ﬁelds  are  R  and  C. 

Theorem 1  (Ostrowski).  Let K  be  a  ﬁeld complete  with  respect  to  an  archimedean 
valuation.  Then  K  is  isomorphic  to  R  or  C,  and  the  valuation  is  equivalent  to 
the  usual  archimedean  valuation. 

We  will  omit the proof  of  this theorem (see, for instance, Neukirch pg.  125). 

Remark.  Nonarchimedean  local  ﬁelds  are  always  CDVFs.  There  are  also  some 
local  ﬁelds  in  positive  characteristic  (namely  the  Laurent  series  Fq ((t))  over  a 
ﬁnite  ﬁeld),  but  we  will  not  discuss  them  in  this  course. 

Example.  There  is  no  square  root  of  −1 in  Q,  but  there  is  a  square  root  in  Q5 
for  instance,  which  we  may  see  from

which  converges  since  |5| <  1 in  Q5 ,  and  2  is  invertible. 

+  . . . 

The  following  lemma  is  extremely  important  in  the  study  of  CDVFs. 

Theorem  2  (Hensel’s lemma).  Let  f (x)  ∈  o[x]  be  a  primitive  polynomial,  i.e. 
0  mod  p.  Suppose  that  the  reduction  f (x) of  f  mod  p  factors as  h(x)g (x),
f (x) 6
= 
into  relatively  prime  polynomials  g , h  ∈  κ[x].  Then  f (x) =  g (x)h(x)  for  some 
polynomials  g , h  ∈  o[x]  such  that  deg g  = deg g  and  g (x) ≡  g (x)  mod  p,  h(x) ≡ 
h(x) mod  p. 

Proof.  Let  π  be  a  uniformizer.  Let  deg f  =  d, deg g  =  m.  Then  deg h  ≤  d − m 
(this  is  because  the  degree  of f  might  be  smaller  than  degree  of  f , if  the highest 
coeﬃcient is divisible by  π .  We  inductively  construct  polynomials  gn  and  hn  of 
degrees  m  and  at  most  d − m  respectively,  such  that 
•  gn+1  ≡  gn  mod  πn+1 
•  hn+1  ≡  hn  mod  πn+1 

4 

LECTURE  7  NOTES 

•  f  ≡  gnhn  mod  πn+1 . 
Then  it  will  follow  that  gn , hn  converge  to  polynomials  g , h  with  the  required 
degree  constraints  and  reductions  mod  p,  such  that  f  =  gh.  Now,  g0  and  h0 
can  be  taken  to  be  lifts  of  g , h  of  the  same  degrees.  Note  that  by  assumption, 
ag0  +  bh0  ≡  1  mod  p  for  some  polynomials  a, b  ∈  o[x].  To  do  the  inductive  step, 
suppose we have already  constructed  g0 , h0 , . . . , gn , hn  with the desired properties. 
Let  gn+1  =  gn  +  pnπn+1 ,  hn+1  =  hn  +  qnπn+1 .  The  ﬁrst  two  conditions  are 
automatically  satisﬁed,  and  the  third  condition  for  n  + 1 becomes 
f  − gnhn  ≡  (gnqn  +  hnpn )πn+1  mod  πn+2 
since  the  last  term  is  π 2n+2pnqn  which  is  divisible  by  πn+2 .  By  the  induction 
hypothesis,  the  LHS  is  divisible  by  πn+1 .  Let  rn  =  π−n−1(f  −  gnhn ).  Then 
cancelling  πn+1 ,  the  third  condition  becomes 

rn  ≡  gnqn  +  hn pn  mod  π  ≡  g0qn  +  h0pn  mod  π . 

Now  we  recall  that  ag0  +  bh0  ≡  1  mod  π ,  so  that (arn )g0  + (brn )h0  ≡  rn  mod 
π .  At  this  point  we  would  just  like  to  set  qn  =  arn  and  pn  =  brn ,  but  the 
problem  is  that  the  degrees  might  become  too  large  if  we  do  that.  So  the  ﬁnal 
trick  is  the  following:  noting  that  the  highest  coeﬃcient  of  g0  is  a  unit (because 
deg g0  = deg g),  we  can  divide  with remainder: 

where deg  pn  < degg0  =  m.  Then  we  have 

brn  =  qg0  +  pn 

rn  ≡  arng0  +  brnh0  ≡  arng0  + (qg0  +  pn )h0  = (arn  +  h0q)g0  +  pnh0  mod  π . 

Let  qn  be  the  polynomial  obtained  from  arn  +  h0 q  by  omitting  all  coeﬃcients 
divisible by  π .  Then  because 

g0qn  +  h0pn  ≡  rn  mod  π 

and deg  rn  ≤  d  (follows from induction hypothesis), deg h0pn  ≤  (d − m) + (m  − 
1)  =  d − 1, and  the fact that the highest  coeﬃcient  of  g0  is a unit, forces deg qn  ≤ 
� 
d − m.  This  completes  the  inductive  step.

Corollary 2.  Let  K  be  a  CDVF.  Then  for  every  irreducible  polynomial 
f (x) =  a0  +  a1x  +  · · ·  +  anx n  ∈  K [x]

such that  a0an  = 0,  we  have  that 

|f | :=  max{|a0 |, |a1 |, . . . ,  |an |} 

equals  max(|a0 |, |an |).  In  particular,  if  an  = 1  and  a0  ∈  o, then  f  ∈  o[x]. 

Proof.  After multiplying by an element  of  K  we  may  assume  w.lo.g.  that  f  ∈  o[x] 
and  that  |f | = 1, i.e.  that  one of  a0 , a1 , . . . , an  is a unit.  Let  ar  be  the  ﬁrst  among 
the  a0 , a1 , . . . , an  such that  |ar | = 1.  Then 
f (x) ≡  x r (ar  +  ar+1x  +  . . . anx n−r ) mod  p. 

If  max(|a0 |, |an |) <  1 then 0  < r < n  and  so  f  would factor in  o[x] by Hensel’s

lemma,  contradicting  irreducibility. 

Now let  L/K  be a  ﬁnite (hence algebraic)  extension of  a CDVF  K .  Then  we’ll 
deﬁne a valuation on 
L
which extends that on 
L→֒K
, and show that
L
is a 
CDVF  with  respect  to  it. 
Theorem 3.  There  is  a  unique  extension  of  a  discrete  valuation  | | of  K  to  any 
ﬁnite  extension  L/K ,  and it is given by  |α| =  �NL/K (α),  where  L/K  has degree 
n
n.  The  ﬁeld  L  is  complete  with  respect  to  this  valuation. 
Proof.  Let  O be the integral  closure of  o in  L. We claim  O =  {α  ∈  L | NL/K (α) ∈ 
o}. It’s clear that  α  ∈  O ⇒  NL/K (α) ∈  o, since  o is integrally  closed (it’s a PID). 
Conversely, let  α  ∈  L  and  NL/K (α) ∈  o. Let 
f (x) =  x d  +  ad−1x d−1  +  · · ·  +  a0  ∈  K [x] 
be  the  minimal  polynomial  of  α.  Then  NL/K (α) =  ±a0  ∈  o  for  m  = [L  :  K (α)], 
m
so  a0  ∈  o  as  well.  By  the  irreducibility  of  f (x),  the  lemma  above  implies f (x) ∈ 
o[x],  so  that α  ∈  O. 
Now  for  the  function  |α| =  �NL/K (α),  it’s  clear  that  α  = 0  ⇔ |α| =  0  and 
n
|αβ | =  |α||β |. To prove the  stong  triangle inequality  |α + β | ≤ max(|α|, |β |), it’s 
enough  after  dividing  by  α  or  β  to  show 
|α| ≤ 1  → |α + 1| ≤ 1 

But |α| ≤ 1 is equivalent to α  ∈  O which implies  α+1  ∈  O which gives  |α+1| ≤ 1, 
so  this  is  true  as  well.  It’s  clear  from  NL/K (a) =  an  for  a  ∈  K  that  the  valuation 
extends  that  of  K . 
Uniqueness:  suppose we have another valuation  | | ′  extending  that  of  K . Then 
let  O, O ′  be  the  corresponding  DVRs  and  B, B ′  the  associated  maximal  ideals. 
We  will  show  that  the  valuations  are  equivalent,  so  one  is  a  power  of  the  other. 
Since  they  agree  on  K ,  they  are  equal. 
Suppose  α  ∈  O\O ′  . Let 
f (x) =  x d  +  ad−1x d−1  +  · · ·  +  a0  ∈  K [x]

be  the  minimal  polynomial  of  α  over  K .  Then  ad−1 , . . . , a0  ∈  o  by  the  above. 
6∈  O ′  ⇒  v  ′  (α) <  0  ⇒  α−1  ∈  B ′  . Then 
Also  α 
1 =  −ad−1α−1  ·  ·  ·  − a0 (α−1)d  ∈  B ′ 
which is impossible.  This shows that O ⊂  O ′  or in other words  |x| ≤ 1  ⇒ |x| ′  ≤  1. 
The reverse implication must also be true:  otherwise if  |x| ′  ≤  1 and  |x| >  1, then 
letting  π  ′  be  a  uniformizer  for  O ′  ,  we  have  that  y  = 1/(π  ′  +  π  ′2xe ) has  |y | <  1 
for  large  enough  e, but  |y | ′  >  1.  Therefore  the  valuations  are  equivalent. 
Finally,  to  show  that  L  is  complete,  notice  that  L  is  a  ﬁnite  dimensional 
vector  space  over  L.  Now  we  use  the  standard  fact  that  for  any  ﬁeld  complete 
with  respect  to  an  absolute  value,  any  two  norms  on  a  ﬁnite  dimensional  vector 
space  over  it  are  equivalent,  i.e.  they  deﬁne  the  same  topology,  or  equivalently, 
each  norm  is  bounded  by  a  ﬁxed  positive  multiple  of  the  other.  So  the  above 
norm on  L  must be equivalent (in the topological  sense)  to the max norm, which 
is  deﬁned  as  follows:  let  v1 , . . . , vn  be  a  basis  of  L  over  K .  The  max  norm  of  an 
element  x  =  � 
xivi  (xi  ∈  K ), is just  max{|x1 |, . . . ,  |xn |}.  Now  it’s  clear  that  L 
is  complete  with  respect  to  the  max  norm,  since  for  any  Cauchy  sequence,  each 
of  the  coordinates  will  deﬁne  Cauchy  sequences  in  K ,  which  comverge  because 
� 
K  is  complete.  So  L  is  complete  with  respect  to  the  other  norm  as  well.
