ALGEBRAIC  NUMBER  THEORY 

LECTURE  8  NOTES 

1.  Section  4.1 
We  say  a  set  S  ⊂ Rn  is  discrete  if  the  topology  induced  on  S  is  the  discrete 
topology.  Check  that  this  is  equivalent  to  the  deﬁnition  in  the  book  (every 
compact  subset  K  of  Rn  intersects  S  in  a  ﬁnite  set). 
A  lattice  is  a  discrete  subgroup  Λ  of  Rn  of  rank  n  as  a  Z-module. 
Proof  of  Minkowski’s  theorem.  Translate  all  the  parts  of  S  to  a  ﬁxed  fundamen­
tal  parallelopiped.  Since  the  sum  of  volumes  of  the  translates  is  larger  than  the 
volume  of  the  fundamental  domain,  two  of  the  portions  must  overlap.  The  dif­
ference  of  corresponding  points  in  two  overlapping  portions  gives  a  vector  x  − y 
� 
in the lattice, for  x, y  ∈ S . 
For  a  number  ﬁeld  K  of degree  n  =  r1 + 2r2  over  Q, it follows from dimQK  = 
that  K  ⊗Q  R  ∼ Rr1  × Cr2 ,  although  non-canonically (there 
n  = dimRRr1 
× Cr2 
= 
are  choices  made  in  the  canonical  embedding!) 
We’ll  see  a  version  for  tensoring  with  the  non-archimedean  completions  of  Q 
later. 

2.  Section  4.3 

Example.  Consider  the  ﬁeld  K  =  Q(α),  where  α  is  the  unique  real  root  of 
X 3  − X  − 1.  We  calculate  that  Z[α]  has  discriminant  −23,  which  is  square-
free.  This  implies  that  OK  =  Z[α],  since  otherwise  the (absolute)  discriminant 
of  OK  would be 23/N 2  for  some  integer  N >  1,  and  could  not  be  an  integer, 
which is impossible. 
Now  let’s  determine  the  class  group.  We  have  r1  =  r2  =  1.  By  the  proof  of 
Theorem  2,  we  need  only  look  at  ideals  a  of  norm  N a ≤  4  3! √23  ≈ 1.357.  Since 
π  27 
the  norm  is  an  integer,  it  must  be  1.  So  a  =  OK  which  is  principal.  Therefore 
the  class  group  is  trivial  and  OK  is  a  PID.
