1.  Section  3.3 

If  A′  ⊂  A  and  p  is  a  prime  ideal  of  A, then  p ′  =  p ∩ A  is  a  prime  ideal  of  A′  , 
called  the  restriction  of  p  to  A′  . 

Lemma  1.  Suppose  a1 , a2 , a3  are  ideals  of  A  such  that  a1  is  relatively  prime  to 
the  other  two:  a1  +  ai  =  A  for  i  = 2, 3.  Then  a1  is  relatively  prime  to  their 
product. 

Proof.  We have 1  =  a1 + a2  and 1  =  a1 
′  + a3  for some  a1 , a 1 
′  ∈  a1 ,  a2  ∈  a2 , a3  ∈  a3 . 
Multiplying  we  get

1  = (a1  +  a2 )(a1  +  a3 ) =  a1a1  +  a1a3  +  a1a2  +  a2a3 
The  ﬁrst  three  terms  are  in  a1  and  the last is in  a2a3 .

2.  Section  3.4 

Proof  of Theorem 2: We deﬁne  m ′  =  {x ∈  K | xm ⊂  A}. This is the  conductor 
of  m  into  A.  This  is  a  natural  candidate  for  the  inverse  of  m:  suppose  that 
m  has  an  inverse  fractional  ideal  n.  Then  for  any  x  ∈  m ′  ,  we  have  xm  ⊂  A, 
so  multiplying  by  n  we get  xA  =  xmn  ⊂  n,  which  implies  x  ∈  n  since 1  ∈  A. 
Conversely, by  nm =  A,  we  see  that  n  is  contained  in  m ′  by  deﬁnition.  So  m ′  =  n 
if  the inverse  n  exists. 
The intuition behind  the last paragraph  of  the proof is as follows:  we want an 
element  of  K \A which  takes  m  into  A. We transfer this problem by  multiplying 
by (a)m −1  (which  we  haven’t  shown  exists)  to  saying  that  we  want  an  element 
which  takes (a) into (a)m −1 ,  where  a ∈  m  So if  we  could factor (a) into  p1  . . . pr , 
with  say  p1  =  m  this  would  be  saying  that  we  want  an  element  in  p2  . . . pr  but 
not in (a),  which  is  what  b  is (and  b/a  is  the  required  element  of  K \A  which 
takes (a) into p2  . . . pr ).  Since we don’t have the factorization theorem into ideals 
yet,  we  settle for (a) ⊃  p1  . . . pr  with  r  minimal. 
Remark.  If  p  and  q  are  two  distinct  maximal  ideals  of  a  Dedekind  domain,  then 
p +  q  =  A  since  p +  q  contains  p  which is  maximal,  and doesn’t  equal it (else 
q ⊂  p  contradincting  maximality  of  q).  So  with  the  lemma  above  we  have  that

This leads directly  to the proof  that  np(a +  b) = inf (np(a), np(b).
