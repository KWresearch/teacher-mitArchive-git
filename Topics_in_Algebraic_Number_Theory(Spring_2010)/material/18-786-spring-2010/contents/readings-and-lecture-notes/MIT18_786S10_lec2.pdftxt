Material  covered:  Sections  1.4  through  1.7  of  textbook. 

For  the  proof  of  Theorem  1  of  Section  1.5,  a  motivating  example  to  keep  in 
mind  is  that  of  a  lattice  in  Zn .  The  proof  using  linear  forms  basically  starts  oﬀ 
with  the  observation  that  any  lattice  is  cut  out  by  linear  congruences  modulo 
some integers. 

1.  Section  1.7 

If  K  is  a  ﬁeld, its characteristic is the  smallest positive integer  n  such  that 1 + 
· · ·+ 1 (n terms) is 0, or if  no such positive integer exists, we say the characteristic 
of  K  is  zero.  Now  if  K  is  a  ﬁnite  ﬁeld,  its  characteristic  must  be  ﬁnite  and  also 
a prime (because  K  is  an  integral  domain).  So  K  is  a  vector  space  over  Fp .  So 
|K | =  p e  for  some  positive  integer  e.  In  fact,  we  will  see  that  there  is  a  unique 
ﬁnite  ﬁeld  of  size  p e . 
First,  notice  that  any  ﬁnite  ﬁeld  of  characteristic  p  has  a  Frobenius  automor­
phism x  7→  xp . This is injective on a  ﬁnite set, hence surjective.  For a  ﬁeld  of  size 
p e ,  any  nonzero  element  x  satisﬁes  xpe 
−1  =  1.  So  for  all  x  in  the  ﬁeld,  xpe 
=  x. 
So the  e’th  power  of  the  Frobenius  map  is  trivial. 
Take  an  algebraic  closure  K  of  Fp .  Now  if  L  is  any  ﬁnite  algebraic  extension 
e 
of degree  e  of  Fp ,  then  every  element  of  L  is  a  root  of  xp  −  x.  But  there  are 
exactly  p e  =  |L| solutions  to  this  equation  in  the  algebraic  closure  K .  Hence  L 
is  unique. 
On  the  homework,  you  will  count  irreducible  polynomials  of  degree  e  over  Fp . 
Any  such  polynomial  leads  to  the  unique  ﬁeld  of  p e  elements. 
An  interesting  exercise  is  to  prove  Wedderburn’s  theorem:  any  ﬁnite  division 
algebra (i.e.  satisfying the axioms of a ﬁeld, except that multiplication is not 
assumed  to  be  commutative)  must  be  a  ﬁeld.

The  above  sequence  of  statements  makes  a  number  ﬁeld  K  generated  by  an 
element  with  minimal polynomial  x 3 + 3x + 1,  which  is  irreducible  over  Q. Then 
it  computes  the  discriminant  of  this  ﬁeld.  Then  we  compute  the  decomposition 
of  the  prime  3  into  ideals  of  OK .  We  see  that  3  is  the  third  power  of  the  prime 
ideal (1 + x). 
The  next few  statements  compute the  norm  of the ideal (hnf  means Hermite 
normal form: ignore this for  now) (1 +  x) which  must  be  3,  and  checks  that  it  is 
pricipal,  which  is  true.
