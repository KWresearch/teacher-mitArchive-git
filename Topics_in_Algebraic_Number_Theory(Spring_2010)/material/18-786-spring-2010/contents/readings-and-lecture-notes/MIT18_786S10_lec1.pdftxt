1.  Section  1.1 

Recall  that  to  an  integral  domain  A  we  can  associate  its  Ô¨Åeld  of  fractions 
K  = Frac(A) =  { a
0}.  More  formally,  K  =  {(a, b) :  a, b  ‚àà A, b  =6
b  :  b  =6
/  ‚àº, 
0}c 
where  ‚àº is the  equivalence  relation (a, b) ‚àº (c, d) iÔ¨Ä  ad ‚àí bc = 0 (i.e.  ‚Äú  a  =  ‚Äù).

b
A general  fractional  ideal  f  of  A  is  a  subset  of  K  = Frac(A) such  that 
(1)  af  ‚àà f  ‚àÄa ‚àà A, f  ‚àà f 
(2)  f1  +  f2  ‚àà f  ‚àÄf1 , f2  ‚àà f 
(3)  ‚àÉc ‚àà A  such that  cf  is  an  ideal  of  A. 
A  non-example  of  a  fractional  ideal  is  the  set  K : 
it  satisÔ¨Åes  the  Ô¨Årst  two 
properties but  not the third  one in general:  the problem is that  we have inverted 
‚Äútoo  many‚Äù  elements. 

Example.  Some principal ideal domains (PIDs): 
(1)  Z is a PID (any  nonzero ideal is a subgroup,  so is generated by  a smallest 
positive  element). 
(2)  For  a  Ô¨Åeld  k ,  the  ring  of  univariate  polynomials  k [X ]  is  a  PID  (take  a 
lowest  degree  element). 

Some  examples  of  non-PIDs: 
(1)  Z[‚àö‚àí5] is  not  a  PID  because  of  the  failure  of  unique  factoriza¬≠
Example. 
tion 2 3  = (1 + ‚àö‚àí5)(1 ‚àí ‚àö‚àí5).  The ideal (2, 1 + ‚àö5)  is  not  a principal 
¬∑ 
ideal. 
Proof.  (of Thm 1.1.IV)  Let  P  be  a  set  of  representatives  of  the  irreducible  ele¬≠
ments  of  A,  modulo  units (recall  that this  means  p ‚àà A  is  a prime/irreducible if 
p  is  not  a  unit  and  p =  xy  implies  x  or  y  is  a  unit).  Then  given  any  x ‚àà K ‚àó  we 
want  to  show  that  x  can  be  uniquely  written  expressed  as 
ÔøΩ 
p‚ààP 

x =  u

LECTURE  1  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES 

First  show  existence  of  factorization.  Uniqueness  will  follow  from  lemma  III 
of  Section  1.1.  For  existence,  we  can  assume  x ‚àà A  since  we  can  write  x =  x1/x2 
and  express  x1 , x2  A  in  this  form,  and  divide.  So  now  assume 
x  ‚àà
‚àà
A.  Then 
xA  is  an  ideal  of  A.  If  it  is  the  entire  ring  A, then  x  is  a  unit  and  we  are  done. 
Else  it  is  contained  in  a  maximal  ideal  pA  for  some  prime  p.  Then  p x  so  write 
|
x  =  x1p.  Again  if  x1A  =  A  we  are  done.  Else  Ô¨Ånd  a  prime  dividing  x1  and  so 
on.  So this gives  us  a  sequence  of  elements  x =  x0 , x1 , x2 , . . .  where  xi+1  =  xi /pi 
for  some  prime  pi .  Then  the  sequence  of  ideals  ai  =  xiA  is  increasing.  The  set 
  ai  is  an  ideal  of  A,  hence  it  is  generated  by  one  element,  say  y .  Then  y  lies 
in  some  aN  and  this  means  that  the  sequence  must  terminate  at  aN , i.e.  xn  is  a 
unit.  So  a  Ô¨Ånite  factorization  exists. 

2.  Section  1.2 

Solving  Pythagoras‚Äô  equation  geometrically. 
Write  the  equation  as  X 2  +  Y 2  =  1,  where  X  =  x/z , Y  =  y/z .  It  is  suÔ¨Écient 
to  Ô¨Ånd  all  rational  solutions  of  this  equation.  Now  we  know  one  point  on  this 
circle,  for  example  P0  = (‚àí1, 0).  For  any  other  point  with  rational  coordinates, 
it‚Äôs  clear that the  slope of  the line joining it to  P0  must be rational (the converse 
is  also  not  too  hard  to  see).  So  write 

Y 
m 

X  =  ‚àí1 + 
and  plug  into  the  equation  to  get 
ÔøΩ2Y 
ÔøΩ
‚àí1 + 
m 
which  leads  to  the  solution  Y  = 2m/(m2  + 1), X  = (1 ‚àí m2 )/(1 + m2 ). 
Section 1.3  is  the  Chinese  remainder  theorem  for  general  rings. 

+  Y 2  = 1 

3.  gp/Pari  example 

Example.  G  =  bnfclassunit(x^2+5) 
This  G  contains  lots  of  arithmetic  information.  For  instance  G[2, 1]  = [0, 1] 
gives  the  number  of  real  and  complex  embeddings  of  the  number  Ô¨Åeld.  G[5, 1][1] 
is  the  class  number  of  the  Ô¨Åeld  Q(‚àö‚àí5)  which  is  2.  G[5, 2]  gives  the  structure 
of  the  class  group  in  terms  of  its  elementary  divisors.  Here  it  has  to  be  Z/2. 
Finally,  G[5, 1][3]  gives  the  generators  of  the  cyclic  components.  Here  we  get  a 
matrix  with  colums [2, 0]  and [1, 1]  which  means that the ideal is (2, 1 + ‚àö5).
