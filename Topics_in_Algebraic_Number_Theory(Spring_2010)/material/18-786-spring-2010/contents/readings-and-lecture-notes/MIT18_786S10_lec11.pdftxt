First  we’ll  prove  the  proposition  from  last  time: 

Proposition  1.  Let  A  be  a  Dedekind  domain  with  fraction  ﬁeld  K .  Let  L/K 
be  a  ﬁnite  separable  extension,  and  B  the  integral  closure  of  A  in  L.  Assume  B 
is  monogenic  over  A,  i.e.  B  =  A[α]  for  some  α  ∈ B .  Then  let  f (X )  ∈ A[X ] 
be  the  minimal  polynomial  of  α  over  K .  Let  p  be  a  prime  of  A  and let  f  be  the 
reduction  of  f  mod  p.  If  f  factors  as 
f [X ] =  P 1(X )e1  . . .  P r (X )er 
where  P1 , . . . , Pr  ∈ (A/p)[X ] are  irreducible  and  monic,  then 
pB  =  Be

where  Bi  =  pB  +  Pi (α)B ,  the  ramiﬁcation  index  of  Bi  is  ei ,  and  the  residue 
degree  of  Bi  is  fi  = deg P i . 

A[α]

Proof.  Let  P  be  an  irreducible  factor  of  f , let  α  be  a  root  of  P  (in  the  algebraic 
closure  of  A  =  A/p),  and  let B be the prime  of  B  which  is  the  kernel  of  the  map 
A[α]→
(the  right  hand side  is  a  ﬁeld).  It  is  clear  that  pB  +  P (α)B  is  contained  in  B. 
Conversely,  if  g (α)  ∈ B,  then  g(al)  = 0,  so  g  =  P h  for  some  h  ∈ A[X ]  since 
is  the  minimal  polynomial  of  α.  Then  g  − P h  ∈ A[X ]  must  actually  have 
P 
coeﬃcients in  p,  so  g (α) ∈ P (α)B  +  pB .  So  we  do  have  B =  pB  +  P (α)B .  It’s 
clear that get  exactly  all  the primes in the factorization  of  p  in  this  way,  for  this 
construction gives  a prime  B  of  B  lying  above  p,  and  conversely,  if  B  lies  above 
p, then  B /B  is  a  ﬁeld  extension  of  A/p  generated  by  the  image  of  α  in  B /B. 
It’s  clear  that  the  residue degree [B /Bi  :  A/p]  of  Bi  is  fi  = deg αi  (over  A) 
i  be  the  ramiﬁcation  index  of  Bi ,  so  that  pB  =  Be

1.  Section  5.3 

If  L/K  is an extension of  number  ﬁelds,  we deﬁne  DL/K  to be the discriminant 
ideal  of  OL  over  OK . 
The  main  result  of  this  section  says  that  for  a  ﬁnite  separable  extension  L/K , 
where  K  =  F rac(A) for  a  Dedekind  domain  A,  and  B  the  integral  closure  ofA 
in  L,  a  prime  p  of  A  ramiﬁes in  B  iﬀ it divides the discriminant  DB/A . 
We  can  use  this  example  to  compute  which  primes  which  ramify  in  quadratic 
or  cyclotomic  ﬁelds,  in  particular. 
Example.  If  d  ≡ 2, 3  mod  4  is  squarefree,  then  the  discriminant  of  Q(√d) is 4d. 
So the prime 2  ramiﬁes in the quadratic ﬁeld.  We can check that (2)  = (2, √d)2 
if  d  ≡ 2 mod 4  and 1(2)  = (2, 1 + √d)2  if  d  ≡ 3  mod  4. 
The discriminants  D  which  are  equal  to  d  if  d  ≡ 1  mod  4  and  squarefree  and 
4d  if  d  ≡ 2, 3  mod  4  and  squarefree,  are  called  fundamental discriminants. 
Example.  For the cyclotomic  ﬁeld,  Q(ζpr ), the discriminant is a power of p. So the 
only prime which  ramiﬁes is  p, and  p ramiﬁes completely: (p) = (1 − ζpr )[Q(ζ r ):Q] . 
p
k 
This follows from  using (1 − ζp
r ) = (1 − ζpr ) as  ideals  whenever  k  is  coprime  to 
p. 

2.  Section  5.4 

Quadratic extensions are monogenic,  so we can apply our proposition to  ﬁgure 
out how primes decompose. 
(1)  d  ≡ 2, 3  mod  4.  Then  α  =  √d  generates  the  ring  of  integers.  Its  minimal 
polynomial is  X 2  − d,  whose  discriminant  is  4d.  So  p  ramiﬁes iﬀ  p 4d 
(i.e.  X 2  − d  is  a  square  mod  p.  Note  that  for  p = 2,  we  either  get  X 2| or 
X 2  + 1  ≡ (X  + 1)2  mod  2).  Now  if  p  doesn’t divide 4d, then  p  splits  as 
p1p2  (with e(pi ) = 1, f (pi ) = 1)  iﬀ  X 2 − d  mod  p  has  two  roots  in  Fp , i.e. 
iﬀ  d  is  a  quadratic  residue  mod  p.  Otherwise  p  is inert (remains prime), 
with  e  = 1, f  = 2. 
(2)  d  ≡ 1 mod 4.  Then  α  = (1 + √d)/2 generates the ring  of integers,  and its 
minimal polynomial is  X 2 − X + (1 − d)/4,  whose  discriminant  is  d. So  p 
ramiﬁes iﬀ  p d.  Otherwise,  we  calculate  as  follows:  if  p  = 2 then  p  splits 
|
iﬀ (1 − d)/4  ≡ 0  mod  2  iﬀ  d  ≡ 1  mod  8.  If  p  is  odd  then  the  condition  is 
as before:  p  splits iﬀ  d  is  a  quadratic  residue  mod  p.

3.  Extensions  of  local  fields 

Let  K  be  a  nonarchimedean  local  ﬁeld:  for  us,  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp .  Let 
L/K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension (separable  since  K  has  characteristic  0).  Let  p = (π) 
be  the  prime  ideal  of  o  =  OK ,  where  π  =  πK  is  a  uniformizer.  Then  there  is 
only  one  prime  B  above  p,  since  L  is a nonarchimedean local  ﬁeld too (unique 
extension of the valuation), so  OL  is a DVR and has a unique nonzero prime ideal. 
So  pOL  =  Be ,  where  f  =residue  class  degree  of  B  satisﬁes  ef  =  n  :=  [L  :  K ]. 
Now if  e  = 1, f  =  n  we  say  the  extension  is  unramiﬁed,  and  if  e  =  n, f  = 1  we 
say  the  extension  is  totally  ramiﬁed. 

Proposition  2.  There  is  only  one  unramiﬁed  extension  of  degree  n  of  K . 
Proof.  Let  κ  =  OK /p  be  the  residue  ﬁeld  of  OK . 
It  is  a  ﬁnite  ﬁeld  Fq ,  with 
q  a  power  of  p  (since  if  K  is  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp ,  κ  is  a  ﬁnite  extension 
of  Zp/pZp  ∼ Fp ).  Now  if  L/K  is  an  unramiﬁed  extension  of  degree  n,  we  see 
= 
that [OL /B  :  OK /p] =  f  =  n.  So  OL /B  ∼ Fqn ,  the  unique  extension  of  Fq  of 
= 
degree  n. Now  ﬁx  a generator  α  of  Fqn  over  Fq  and let  f  ∈ Fq [X ] be  its  minimal 
polynomial.  Then  f  has degree  n  and  is  separable,  since  the  extension  of  ﬁnite 
ﬁelds is separable (ﬁnite  ﬁelds are perfect).  Let  f  be  a lift  of  f  to  OK [X ]  and 
choose it to be  monic (and hence  of degree  n).  Then  by  Hensel’s  lemma  applied 
to  OL  and its residue  ﬁeld,  f  has a root  α  in  OL . This  α, being  of degree  n, must 
generate  the  ﬁeld  L  over  K .  Therefore  this  L  must be isomorphic to  K [X ]/(f ). 
Conversely,  it  is  an  easy  check  that  K [X ]/(f ) is  unramiﬁed  of  degree  n  = deg f . 
Since  the  construction  of  f  depends  only  on  K  and  on  n, this shows that  L  must 
be  unique  once  these  are  ﬁxed.  In  other  words,  there  is  exactly  one  unramiﬁed 
� 
extension  of  K  of  every  degree. 

Now  let’s  look  at  the  totally  ramiﬁed  case.  On  the  homework,  you  will  show 
that totally  ramiﬁed  extensions  are given by  specifying  an Eisenstein polynomial 
X n  +  an−1X n−1  +
+  a0
· · · 
with  π |ai  for  all  i,  and  π 2 6 |a0 ;  this  is  the  minimal  polynomial  of  a  uniformizer  of 
OL . 
Combining  these,  one  can  show  that  there  are  only  ﬁnitely  many  extensions 
of  degree  n  of  a  nonarchimedean  local  ﬁeld  K .  The  proof  uses  the  following 
argument,  which is  a  corollary  of Krasner’s lemma (Problem 4  on Problem Set 
4). 
Let  f , g  ∈ K [X ]  be  monic  polynomials.  Deﬁne  |f | to  be  the  maximum  of 
the  absolute  values  of  the  coeﬃcients  of  f .  If  f is  bounded  then  the  absolute 
|
|
values of  the roots of  f  are also bounded (for instance, by looking  at the Newton 
polygon).  Now  ﬁx  f ,  and  suppose  |f  − g | is  small.  Then  if  β  is  any  root  of  g ,  we 
� |
|
have that  f (β ) − g (β ) =  f (β ) is  small.  So  β  must be close to a root  of  f , since 
|
|
f (β ) = (β  − αi ) where  αi  are  the  roots  of  f .  As  β  comes  close  to  say  α  =  α1 , 

4 

LECTURE  11  NOTES 

its  distance  from  the  other  roots  of  f  approaches  the  distance  of  α1  from  ther 
other roots, so it is bounded from below.  We say  that  β  belongs to  α. Now if  f  is 
irreducible  and  g  is  suﬃciently  close  to  f ,  then  Krasner’s  lemma  applied  to  any 
root  β  of  g  shows that  α  ∈ K (β ),  where α  is  the  root  of  f  to  which  β  belongs. 
But  since deg  g  = deg f , we must have  K (α) =  K (β ) and  g  is  irreducible  as  well. 
So  this  tells  us  that  polynomials  which  are  close  enough  to  a  given  irreducible 
polynomial  f  are  also  irreducible  and  generate  the  same  extension.
