1.  Let  A  be  a  ring,  S  a  multiplicatively  closed  subet  of  A,  and  p  an  ideal  of  A  such  that  S ∩ p =  φ.  Show 
that  localization  commutes  with  quotients:  letting  A′  =  S−1A,  p  =  pA′  and  S¯ =  S  mod  p,  show  that

2.  Let  α  be  a  root  of  f (x) =  x4  +  x3  +  x2  + 1.  Figure  out  the  decomposition  of  the  primes  2, 19  and  61 
in  the  ring  of  integers  of  Q(α).  Which  primes  ramify? 

3.  Let  K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp  and  L  be totally  ramiﬁed  over  K  of degree  n. Let  πL  be a uniformizer 
of  L.  Show  that  πL  satisﬁes  an  Eisenstein  equation

2  .  Conversely,  any  root  of  such  an  equation  generates  a  totally 
with  ai  ∈  pK  for  all  i,  and  a0  6∈  pK 
ramiﬁed  extension  of  degree  n. 

4.  Show that any  extension of  non-archimedean local  ﬁelds  K  ⊂  L  can  be  written  as  a  tower  K  ⊂  M  ⊂  L 
of  an  unramiﬁed  extension  K  ⊂  M  and  a  totally  ramiﬁed  extension  M  ⊂  L. 

5.  Show  that  any  ﬁnite  extension  of  p-adic  ﬁelds  is  monogenic.

6.  Let  K  be  a  non-archimedean  local  ﬁeld,  i.e.  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp .  Let  o  be  its  valuation  ring,  and 
p = (π) the  maximal  ideal,  with  π  being  the  uniformizer.  Let  U0  =  U  =  o ∗  be the  multiplicative group 
of  units  of  o,  and  deﬁne,  for  i  ≥  1,  Ui  = 1 + p i .  Show  that  U /U1  is  cyclic,  U  ∼ U1  ×  (U /U1 ),  and

that  p 
=  Ui/Ui+1  under  the  map  x 
7→  1 + x,  is  an  isomorphism  from  the  additive  group  on  the 
left  to  the  multiplicative  group  on  the  right,  for  i  ≥  1.  Can  you  deﬁne  an  isomorphism  from  p  to  U1 ? 

7.  Show  that  there  are  only  ﬁnitely  many  extensions  of  Qp  of  any  ﬁxed  degree  n. 

8.  Let  L, M  be  ﬁnite,  linearly  disjoint  extensions  of  a  number  ﬁeld  K ,  i.e. 
if  e1 , . . . , em  is  a  basis  for  L 
over  K  and  f1 , . . . , fn  is  a  basis  for  M  over  K , then  {eifj } is  a  basis  for  the  compositum  LM  over  K . 
Assume that the discriminants  dL/K , dM/K  are  coprime.  Then  show  that  OLM  =  OLOM .
