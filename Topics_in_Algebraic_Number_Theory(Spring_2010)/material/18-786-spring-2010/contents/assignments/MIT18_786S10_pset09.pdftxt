1.  Let  L/K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  ﬁnite  ﬁelds.  Show  that  the  norm  from  L  to  K  is  surjective.  (Hint: 
use  Hilbert’s  theorem  90  and  the  Herbrand  quotient.) 

2.  Let  L/K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  ﬁnite  ﬁelds.  Show  that  the  trace  map  from  L  to  K  is  surjective.

3.  Check  that  MG  =  M  ⊗Z[G]  Z  where  Z  is  considered  as  a  trivial  Z[G]  module.  (Hint:  normal  basis

4.  Prove  Proposition  3.2  in  the  book. 
Note: 
for  homology,  the  corestriction  map  is  natural  and  deﬁned  as  the  map  induced  by  deﬁning 
C or  :  H0 (H, M )  →  H0 (G, M )  in  dimension  0  as  MH  =  M /IH M  →  M /IGM  =  MG ,  noting  that 
IH  ⊂  IG ,  and  extending  to  higher  dimensions  by  using  Shapiro’s  lemma.

(Hint:  Consider  the  exact  sequence  of G  or  H  modules 0  →  IG  →  Z[G] →  Z →  0  and  take  homology 
with  respect  to  G  and  H  and  compare).

5.  Prove  that  the  Galois  group  of  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  local  ﬁelds  is  solvable,  as  follows.  Let  L/K  be 
a  ﬁnite  Galois  extension  with  Galois  group  G,  with  vK  a  discrete  normalized  valuation  of  K  which 
therefore  admits  a  unique  extension  w  to  L.  Let  vL  =  ew  be  the  associated  normalized  valuation  of  L, 
where  e  is  the  ramiﬁcation  index  of  L/K  (i.e.  we  want  vK (πK ) =  vL (πL ) = 1). 

For  every  real  number  s  ≥ −1 deﬁne the  s ′  th  ramiﬁcation group  of  L/K  by 

Gs  =  {g  ∈  G | vL (ga − a) ≥  s  + 1  ∀a  ∈ OL }. 

(a)  Prove  that  the  Gs  form  a  chain  G  =  G−1  ⊃  G0  ⊃  G1  ⊂  . . .  of  normal  subgroups  of  G. 
(b)  Show  G−1 /G0  is  cyclic.

(c)  For  every  integer  s  ≥  0,  deﬁne  the  map  Gs /Gs+1  →  UL 
by  sending  g  to  g (πL )/πL . 
(Here  U (s) 
= 1 +  ms  for  s  ≥  1  and  O∗  for  s  =  0.)  Show  that  this  is  a  well-deﬁned  injective

homomorphism  independent  of  the  choice  of  uniformizer  πL . 

(d)  Show  that  Gs /Gs+1  is  a  ﬁnite  abelian  group  for  every  s  ≥  1.  Conclude  that  G  is  solvable.
