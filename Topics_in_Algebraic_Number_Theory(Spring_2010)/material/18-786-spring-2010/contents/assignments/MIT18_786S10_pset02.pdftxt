r 
1.  Show  that  for  p  a prime,  r  ≥ 1,  the  polynomial  X p  −1 
is irreducible in  Q[x].  Compute  the  ring  of 
X pr−1 
−1 
integers  of  Q(ζpr ) and  therefore  the  discriminant  of  this  cyclotomic  ﬁeld. 

2.  Let  K  be  a  number  ﬁeld.  Show  that  α  ∈ OK  is  a  unit  iﬀ  NmK/Q (α) =  ±1.  Let  p 
that  ζpq  − 1  ∈ OQ(ζ
)  is  a  unit. 
pq 
3.  Give  an  explicit  example  of  a  non-perfect  ﬁeld  K  and  a  ﬁnite  extension  L  of  K ,  with  a  basis  x1 , . . . , xn 
of  L  over  K ,  such  that  D(x1 , . . . , xn ) = 0. 
4.  Compute the units of the ring  of integers of  the imaginary quadratic  ﬁeld  Q(√d) for  d <  0. 
5.  Compute  the  ring  of  integers  of  Q(√2). 
3

6=  q  be primes.  Show 

6.  What  is  the  unique  quadratic  subﬁeld  of  Q(ζp )? 

7.  Let  B  ⊂ B  ′  be  A-algebras (i.e.  there is a ring  homomorphism  A
B ),  with B  ′  integral  over  B ,  and 
→
let  C  be  another  A-algebra.  Show that  B  ′  ⊗A  C  is  integral  over  B  ⊗A  C . 
8.  Prove the Noether normalization lemma: Let  k  be  a  ﬁeld,  and  A  be  a  ﬁnitely generated  algebra over  k . 
Then  there  exist  x1 , . . . , xn  ∈ A  which  are algebraically independent over  k  and  such  that  A  is integral 
over  k [x1 , . . . , xn ].
