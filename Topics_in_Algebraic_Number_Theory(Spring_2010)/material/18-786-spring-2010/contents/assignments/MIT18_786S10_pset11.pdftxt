18.786  Problem  Set  11  (due  Thursday  May  6  in  class) 

1.  Prove the local Kronecker-Weber theorem using Local class  ﬁeld theory, as follows. The local  reciprocity 
∼
map  gives  an  isomorphism  Gab  =  UK  ×  Zˆ ,  using  a  splitting  of  the  exact  sequence 
K 

i.e.  a  choice  of  uniformizer  π . 

0  →  UK  →  K ×  →  Z →  0 

(a)  Prove  that  Qun 
p  =  Qp (ζm )(m,p)=1 . 
(b)  The “ramiﬁed” part  of  K ab/K , denoted  Kπ , is deﬁned to be the  ﬁxed ﬁeld  of  F robK  ∈  Gab  , and by 
K
the above structure theorem for  Gab  , the Galois group  of  Kπ /K is isomorphic to  UK . To prove the 
K
local  Kronecker-Weber  theorem  we  need  to  show  that  when  K  =  Qp , Kπ  =  Qp (ζpn )n∈Z .  Show  it 
(n) 
suﬃces to prove that the image of  the norm map  NQp (ζpn )/Qp Qp (ζpn ) is UK  × Z ⊂  UK  × Z = 
Q×
p  . 
(n)
(c)  Now  prove  NQp (ζpn )/Qp Qp (ζpn ) =  UK  ×  Z.  First  show  that  the  norm  of  1 − ζpn  is  p,  and  then 
use  the  index  of  the  norm  subgroup  to  conclude. 

2.  Check  the assertion made in Milne V.4.1 (pg  166): i.e.  check  that  IS∞  is  a  closed  subspace  of  IK  and 
that  the  quotient  is  a  direct  sum  of  countably  many  copies  of  Z  with the discrete topology. 

3.  Let  K  be  a  number  ﬁeld  and  let  MK  be  its  set  of  valuations,  normalized  to  be  extend  the  valuation 
from  Qp  or  R  or  C.  (For  example,  we  still  have |p|v  = 1/p if  v  lies  above  a  prime  p  of  Q).  Deﬁne  the 
local  degree  of  a  valuation  v  to be  nv  = [Kv  :  Qp ],  where p  is  the  restriction  of  v  to  Q.  For  x  ∈  Kv , let 
nv .  Show  that  for  x  ∈  K , 
kxv k  =  |x|v
 

kxv k  = 1.

v∈MK 

This  is  the  product  formula  for  number  ﬁelds.  (Hint:  use  problem  3 on  problem  set  7). 

4.  Let  K  be  a  nonarchimedean  local  ﬁeld  and  n  ≥  2  an  integer.  Assume  K  contains  the  n’th  roots  of 
unity.  Prove the following properties  of  the Hilbert  symbol ( ,  ) = ( ,  )n . 

(a)  If  a  ∈  K ×  and  x  ∈  K  are  such  that  xn  − a 
1, (a, 1 − a) = 1  and (a, a) = (a, −1). 

(b)  Let  a, b  ∈  K ×  with  a  +  b 

6= 0.  Show  that


6= 0,  then (a, xn  − a)  = 1.  Deduce that (a, −a) = 

(c)  Let  n  be  odd  and  a, b, c  ∈  K ×  with  a  +  b +  c  = 0.  Show that (a, b)(b, c)(c, a) = 1. 

(a, b) = (a, a  +  b)(a  +  b, b)(−1, a  +  b)


5.  Let  k  be  a  ﬁeld. 

(a)  Let  A  be  the  set  of  a  ∈  k×  which  are  represented  over  k  by  the binary form  x2  +  by 2  (i.e.  there 
exist  x, y  ∈  k  such  that  a  =  x2  +  by 2).  Show  that  A  is  a  subgroup  of  k×  . 
2  +  ax2
2  +  bx2
(b)  Let  a, b  ∈  k×  .  Show  that  the  form  x1
3  represents  0  nontrivially  over  k  if  and  only  iﬀ 
2  does. 
2  +  bx2
1  +  ax2

6.  Use  gp/Pari  to  do  Exercise  3.14  in  Milne.  Provide  output  of  your  code  and  some  explanation. 

7.  For  each  p  ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7, 31}, let  M  be  a  splitting  ﬁeld  of  X 3  − 2  over  Qp .  Describe  NmM/Qp M ×  as  a 
subgroup  of  Q× 
p  .

8.  Let  f (x) ∈  Z[x] be  a  monic  irreducible  polynomial  with  integer  coeﬃcients,  such  that  the  degree  of  f 
is prime.  Show that the  reduction  of  f  (mod p) is irreducible for  a positive density  of primes  p. (Hint: 
consider  the  splitting  ﬁeld  of  f  and  use  the  Chebotarev  density  theorem). 

9.  Prove  the  Artin-Whaples  weak  approximation  theorem:  Let  | |1 , . . . ,  | |n  be  nontrivial  inequivalent 
valuations  of  a  ﬁeld  K ,  and  let  ai  ∈  Kvi ,  the  completion  of  K  with  respect  to  | |i ,  for  each  i  = 1 . . . n. 
For  any  ǫ >  0,  there  is  an  element  a  ∈  K  such that  |a  − ai |i  < ǫ  for  all  i. 

10.  For  a  ring  R, let  SLn (R) be the group  of  n × n  matrices  with  detrminant  1.  Show  that  for  any  integer
