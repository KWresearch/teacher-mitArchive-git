1.  Let 
x 2  <  1
⇐⇒  |
2  be  two  norms  on  a  ﬁeld  K .  Show that they  are  equivalent (i.e.  x 1  <  1 
1  and

for  all  x  ∈ K ) if  and  only  if  there  is  a  positive  real  number  s  such that  |x|1  =  |x|s  for  all  x  ∈ K .  Also

show  that  they  are  equivalent  iﬀ  they  induce  the  same  topology  on  K .

•	 If  |an |ρn  does  not  tend  to  0  as  n  → ∞,  then  f (x)  converges  for  x  ∈ Qp  iﬀ  |x| < ρ.  Find  the

4.  Let  K  be  a  ﬁeld  complete  for  a  nonarchimedean  valuation,  and  extend  the  valuation  of  K  (uniquely) 
to  the  algebraic  closure.  Now  suppose  α, β  are  elements  of  K ,  such  that  α  is  separable  over  K (β ),  and 
such  that  for  all  conjugates  αi  =  α  of  α  over  K (β ),  we  have 

|β  − α| <  |αi  − α|. 

Then  show  that  α  ∈ K (β ). 
5.	 Let  K  be a  ﬁeld  complete for the nonachimedean exponential  valuation  v .  Let  f (X ) =  a0 + a1X + +· · ·
anX n  K [X ] be  a  polynomial  with  a0an  =  0.  Now  to  this  polynomial,  associate  a  ﬁnite  polygonal 
∈	
chain, which is the lower convex hull  of the points (i, v(ai ))  in  the  plane.  This  is  called  the  Newton 
polygon  of  f .  Show  that  to  every  line  segment  of  this  polygon  of  slope  −m,  from  say  (r, v(ar ))  to 
(s, v(as )),  correspond exactly  s  − r  roots  of  f  of  valuation  m  (in  the  splitting ﬁeld  of  f ). 
6.  Use gp/Pari  to compute the class numbers of quadratic  ﬁelds  Q(√d) for  |d| <  1000,  and  report  on  any 
patterns  noticed.  In  particular,  pay  attention  to  the  factors  of  2. 

7.  Let f (x) = 8x3−6x−1:  this is the minimal polynomial of  cos(π/9), which is used to show that we cannot 
trisect  a general  angle  using  ruler  and  compasses.  Use Hensel’s lemma (or  modify Newton’s  method 
p-adically)  to  ﬁnd  a  solution  in  Q17  to precision  O(1720 ) [write  a  loop,  do  not  use  polrootspadic()].
