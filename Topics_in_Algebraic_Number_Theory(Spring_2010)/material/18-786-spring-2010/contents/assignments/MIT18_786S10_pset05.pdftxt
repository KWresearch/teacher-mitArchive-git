18.786  Problem  Set  5  (due  Thursday  Mar  11  in  class) 
1.  Compute,  with proof, the  class group  of  the  ring  of integers  of  Q(√−5). 
2.  We  saw  in  lecture  that  if  α  is  an  algebraic  number  all  of  whose  conjugates  have  absolute  value  1,  then 
α  is  a  root  of  unity.  Now  suppose  x  is  a  real  algebraic integer such  that  α >  1  and  all  other  conjugates 
of  α  lie  on  or  inside  the  unit  circle,  and  at  least  one  lies  on  the  unit  circle.  Such  an  α  is  called  a  Salem 
number.  Show  that  the  minimal  polynomial  p(x)  of  α  is  reciprocal,  i.e.  xdeg pp(1/x) =  p.  Give  three 
examples  of  Salem  numbers. 

{∞, 2, 3, 5,

. . .  } be  the  set  of  normalized  valuations  of  Q.  Show  that

.  Show  that  there  is  an 
4.  Let  K  be  a  ﬁeld  which  is  complete  with  respect  to  an  archimedean  valuation 
isomorphism  of  K  with  R  or  C  which  identiﬁes  the  given  valuation  on  K  with  a  valuation  equivalent 
to  the  usual  valuation  on  these  ﬁelds.  [Hint:  show  that  you  can  assume  w.lo.g that  R ⊂ K  and  then 
show  that  every  element  of  K  is  algebraic  over  R  of  degree  at  most  2.] 
5.  Compute a generator for the units of  the real quadratic  ﬁelds  Q(√137)  and  Q(√139). 
6.  Let  ζ  =  e2πi/11  be  a  primitive  eleventh  root  of  unity,  and  K  =  Q(ζ ).  Give  an  explicit  basis  for  a  ﬁnite 
index subgroup  of  the group  of  units  of  OK .  Check your answer using  the logarithmic embedding (and 
gp).
