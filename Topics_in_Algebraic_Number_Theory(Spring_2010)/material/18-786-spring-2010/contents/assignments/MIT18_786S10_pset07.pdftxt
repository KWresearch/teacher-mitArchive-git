1.  Let  L, M  be  ﬁnite  extensions  of  a  ﬁeld  K . 

(a)  If  L, M  are  Galois  over  K ,  then  so  is  their  compositum  LM . 

(b)  If  L, M  are  Abelian  over  K ,  so  is  LM . 
(c)  If  K  is  a  number  ﬁeld,  p  a  prime  of  OK  which  is  unramiﬁed  in  L  and  M , then  p  is  unramiﬁed  in 
LM .

Zp . 

3.  Let  L/K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  number  ﬁelds.  Let  v  be  an  absolute  value  on  K  (archimedean  or 
nonarchimedean),  and  let  Kv  be  the  completion  of  K  with  respect  to  v . 

(a)  Show  that  every  extension  w  to  L  of  the  valuation  v  arises  as  the  composite  ¯v  ◦  τ  for  some  K -
embedding  τ  :  L  →  Kv  into  the  algebraic  closure  of  Kv  (here  ¯v  is  the  unique  extension  of  v  to the

algebraic  closure),  and  that  two  such  extensins  ¯v  ◦ τ  and  v¯ ◦ τ  are equal iﬀ  τ  and  τ  are conjugate 
over  Kv . 
(b)  Show  that  L ⊗ Kv  ∼ �

is  non-archimedean  corresponding  to  the  prime  p  of  OK , the  w  are  in  one-to-one  correspondence 
with the primes  P  lying  above  p.  (Hint:  Use  Proposition  2 of  Samuel,  section  5.2  to  show  this.)

(c)  If  L/K  is  Galois  then  show  that  all  the  extensions  are  conjugates.  For  G  =  Gal(L/K ),  let 
Gw  =  {g  ∈  G | gw  =  w}.  Show  that  Lw  is  Galois  over  Kv  and  Gw  is its Galois group. 
4.  Let  K  be  a  nonarchimedean  local  ﬁeld  and  OK  its  valuation  ring.  Let  U  =  O×  be  the  units  of  OK .
K 
Endow OK  and  U  with  the metric/topology induced from the valuation on  K . Show that  U  is compact, 
and  open  and  closed  in  OK .  Show  that  a  subgroup  of  the  additive  group  OK  is  open  iﬀ  it  is  of  ﬁnite 
index,  and  the  same  statement  for  the  multiplicative  group  U . 

5.  Show  that  cubic  ﬁeld  K  generated  over  Q by  a root of  x3 − x2 − 2x − 8  is  not  monogenic.  (Hint:  ﬁgure 
out  how  2  splits  in  K ,  and  argue  by  contradiction.) 

6.  Let  Cp  be  the  completion  of  Qp .  Show  that  Cp  is  algebraically  closed.  (Hint:  use  Krasner’s  lemma.)
