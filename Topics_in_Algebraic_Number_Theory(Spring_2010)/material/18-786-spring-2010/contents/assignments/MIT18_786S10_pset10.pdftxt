18.786  Problem  Set  10  (due  Thursday  Apr  29  in  class) 

1.  Let  K  be  a  nonarchimedean  local  ﬁeld. 

(a)  Let  L  be  ﬁnite  and  unramiﬁed  over  K .  Show  that  L  is  Galois  over  K ,  and  in  fact  cyclic. 
(b)  Show  that  K un  is  obtained  by  adjoining  to  K  all  the prime to  p  roots  of  unity. 

2.  Check  the  details  of  the  comment  in  Milne  pg.  105,  that  Cor  commutes  with  the  isomorphism 
2 (Gal(L/K ), Z) HT 
2 (Gal(L/K ), L×),  given  by cup  product  with  the  fundamental  class.

3.  (Kummer  theory)  Let  K  be  a  nonarchimedean  local  ﬁeld,  K al  its  algebraic  closure,  and  GK  = 
Gal(K al /K ).  For  any  integer  n,  let  µn  be  the  group  of  n’th  roots  of  unity  in  K al .  Assume  that 
µn  ⊂ K . Then µn  is a (trivial) GK -module.  Show that there is an isomorphism of groups K ×/(K ×)n  →
Hom(GK , µn ). 
(Hint:  use  the  short  exact  sequence 

(·)n 
µn  K al  −→ K al 
→ →
and  compute  the  boundary  map  in  cohomology).

4.  Show  that  for  K  =  Qp , L  =  K (ζpn ),  the  image  of the  norm  NL/K L×  is  U (n) 
Z  inside  K ×  = 
K  × p
(Hint:  use  Local class  ﬁeld  theory  to  ﬁgure  out  the  index  of  the  norm  subgroup). 
5.  (Hilbert  symbol)  Let  K  be  a  nonarchimedean  local  ﬁeld.  For  a, b  ∈ K × ,  deﬁne  (a, b)  = 1 if  z 2  = 
ax2  +  by 2  has  nontrivial  solution  in  K ,  and (a, b) =  −1  otherwise. 
(a)  Show that (a, b) = 1 iﬀ  b  is  a  norm  from  K (√a). 
Note: If  a  is a square, deﬁne  K (√a) to be  K [X ]/(X 2 − a) ∼ K × K , with  the norm taking (x1 , x2 )
=

to  x1x2 .

(b)  Show that (a, b) is  bilinear  in  each  variable:  (aa ′  , b) = (a, b)(a ′  , b).  (Hint:  what  is  the  index  of the 
norm  subgroup?). 
(c)  Show that (a, 1 − a) = (a, −a) = 1. 
(d)  Let  p >  2  be  prime.  Show  that  if  a, b  ∈ F× ,  there  are  x, y  ∈ Fp  such  that  1  =  ax2  +  by 2 .

for  K  =  Qp , p  = 2.
