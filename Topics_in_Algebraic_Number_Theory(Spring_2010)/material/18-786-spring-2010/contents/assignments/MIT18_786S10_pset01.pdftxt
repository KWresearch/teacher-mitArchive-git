18.786  Problem  Set  1  (due  Thursday  Feb  11) 

2+b2 
1.  Let  a  and  b  be  positive  integers  such  that  ab  + 1 divides  a +  b2 .  Show  that  a
2 
ab+1  is  a  perfect  square. 
(Hint:  use  “descent” in  the  sense  of  Fermat). 

2.  Give  an  alternative  proof  of  the  structure  theorem  for  modules  over  a  PID  A,  as  follows: 

(a)  Show  that  A  is  Noetherian  as  an  A-module,  and  that  any  ﬁnitely  generated  module  M  over  A  is 
Noetherian.  (Hint:  Show  that  if N  is  a  submodule  of  a  module  M , then  M  is Noetherian iﬀ both 
N  and  M /N  are). 

(b)  Now  let  M  be  a  ﬁnitely  generated  free  module  over  A  and  N  a  non-zero  submodule.  Write  a 
(ﬁnite) set  of generators of  N  over  A as linear combinations of  some  ﬁxed basis of  M , and  so as row 
vectors  of  a  q × n  matrix  G.  Argue that invertible  row  and  column  operations  are permitted (i.e. 
left  or  right  multiplying  G  by  invertible  matrices).  (Hint:  these  should correspond  to permissible 
change  of  bases/generators  for  M  or  N ). 

(c)  Show that  using  these  operations, you  can  ensure that the top  left  entry  of  the  matrix is the gcd 
of  all  the  entries  of  the  matrix.  Use  it  to  clear  the  ﬁrst  row  and  column,  and  induct. 

3.  Let  p be a prime.  How many irreducible polynomials of degree n  are there in the polynomial  ring  Fp [t]? 
(Hint:  group the  elements  of  Fpn  by  their  minimal  polynomials,  count  and  use  M¨obius  inversion.) 

4.  If  M  and  N  are  submodules  of  some  free  modules  P  over a PID  A,  does  there  necessarily  exist  a  basis 
e1 , . . . , en  of  P  such  that  a1 e1 , . . . , an en  is  a  basis  of  M  and  b1 e1 , . . . , bn en  is  a  basis  of  N ,  for  some 
sets  of  integers  ai  and  bi?  Prove  or give  a  counterexample (with proof ). 

5.  Let  q  =  pe  be  a  prime  power  such  that  q  ≡  1 (mod  4)  and  consider  the  graph  on  q  vertices labeled by 
the  elements  of  Fq ,  where  x  is joined  to  y  iﬀ  x  − y  is  a  square  in  Fq .  Show  that  this  is  an  undirected 
graph, and that it is strongly  regular. That is, not  only is it  regular (every  vertex has the same degree), 
but  also  for  any  vertices  x  and  y ,  the  number  of  vertices  connected  to  both  x  and  y  only  depends  on 
whether  x  and  y  are joined  or  not,  and independent  of  the  speciﬁc  choice  of  x  and  y .  This  is  called  a 
Paley graph.  Show that it has  at least  eq(q − 1)/2  automorphisms. 

6.  Use gp/PARI  to  express the Mersenne prime  p = 2127  − 1 in the form  a2  + ab  + b2 .  Attach  a  printout 
of  the  gp  session.  (Hint:  work  in  Z[ω ]  where  ω  =  e2πi/3  is  a  cube  root  of  unity.  It  is  a  PID.  Find 
6≡  1 (mod  p) such  that  α3  ≡  1 (mod  p) and  then  take  the  gcd  of  α − ω  and  p.)
