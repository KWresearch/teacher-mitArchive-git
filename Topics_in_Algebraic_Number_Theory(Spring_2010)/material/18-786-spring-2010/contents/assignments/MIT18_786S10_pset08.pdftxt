18.786  Problem  Set  8  (due  Thursday  Apr  15  in  class) 

For problems 4  through 6 you  may  assume that the  abelian  category is  M odR ,  the  category  of  modules  over 
a  ring  R. 

1.  Check  the  proof  of  Lemma  II.1.2  in  Milne’s  book,  with  all  the  details.  In  particular,  check  also  that 
induction  is  indeed  a  functor. 

2.  Prove  Remark  II.1.14  in  the  book. 

3.  Prove  the  normal  basis  theorem:  if  L/K  is  a  Galois  extension  of  ﬁelds,  then  ∃ y  ∈  L  such  that  the  set 
{gy | g  ∈  G =  Gal(L/K )} is  a  basis  for  L  as  a  K -vector  space. 

4.  Let  C  be  an  Abelian  category  with  enough  injectives,  and  let 

0  →  X  →  Y  →  Z →  0 

be  a  short  exact  sequence  in  C .  Show  that  there  exist  injective  resolutions  X  →  I ,  Y  →  J and 
• 
• 
Z →  K ﬁtting  into  an  exact  sequence  of  complexes 
•

0  →  I •  →  J •  →  K •  →  0. 

(Hint:  take  any  injective  resolutions I and  K of  X  and  Z  respectively.  Then  deﬁne  J =  I ⊕ K
• 
• 
• 
• 
and  show  how  to  deﬁne  maps  to  make  it  an  injective  resolution  of  Y .) 

• 

5.  Prove  Lemma  II.A.10  in  the  book. 

6.  Prove  Proposition  II.A.11  in  the  book. 

7.  Let  K  =  Fp ((T )),  the  Laurent  series  in  one  variable  over  Fp .  Deﬁne  the  valuation  on  this  ﬁeld  by 
 
∞ 
ar T r |  =  c
for  some  choice  of  c >  1.  That  is,  the  uniformizer  is  T  and  the  valuation  ring 
|  �
r=−m 
consists  of  the  power  series  in  T .  Show  that  not  all  ﬁnite  index  subgroups  of  K ×  are  open.

8.  Let  E  be  the  forgetful  functor  from  the  category  of  G-modules  to  the  category  of  abelian  groups, 
and  F  the  functor  from  abelian  groups  to  G-modules  taking  an  abelian  group  A  to  the  G-module 
Hom(Z[G], A).  Show  that  E  is  left  adjoint  to  F , i.e. 

for  a  G-module  X  and  an  abelian  group  Y .


Hom(E (X ), Y ) ∼ HomG (X, F (Y ))
