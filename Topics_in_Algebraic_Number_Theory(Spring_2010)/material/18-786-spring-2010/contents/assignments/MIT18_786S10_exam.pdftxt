18.786  Final  exam  (take-home,  due  May  13  at  end  of  lecture) 

Please  turn  in  exactly  eight  of  the  following  eleven  problems.  Each  problem  is  worth  10  points.  You 
may  consult  any  resources (textbook,  notes, the internet,  software, problem  sets), but  not  other people.  In 
particular, you  may  not  collaborate  on this  assignment, though you  may  ask  me for  clariﬁcation  or help. 

1.  Let  A  be  a  Dedekind  domain,  and  a  a  non-zero  ideal  of  A. 

(a)  Show  that  A/a  is  a  product  of  principal  ideal  rings. 
(b)  Show  that  a  can  be  generated  as  an  ideal  by  two  elements. 

2.  Show  (without  using  class  ﬁeld  theory)  that  for  any  number  ﬁeld  K ,  there  exists  a  ﬁnite  extension 
L/K  such  that  every  ideal  of  K  becomes  a  principal  ideal  of  L. 

3.  Let  K  be  a  totally  real  number  ﬁeld  of  degree  n,  and  let  σ1 , . . . , σn  be  the  embeddings  of  K  into  R. 
Now let  k  be an integer such  that 0  < k  < n. Show that there is a unit  ǫ  of  OK  satisfying 0  < σj (ǫ) <  1 
for 1  ≤  j ≤  k  and  σj (ǫ) >  1 for  k + 1  ≤  j ≤  n. 

4.	

(a)  Let  L/K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  number  ﬁelds.  Show  that  a  prime  p  of  K  is  totally  split  in  L  if 
and  only  if  it  is  totally  split  in  the  Galois  closure  N  of  L. 
(b)  Let  L/K  be  a  Galois  extension  of  number  ﬁelds  with  Galois  group  isomorphic  to  Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z. 
Show  that  there  are  at  most  ﬁnitely  many  primes  of  K  which  are  non-split  in  L  (i.e.  only  one 
prime  of  L  lies  above  it). 

5.  Let  A  be  a  ﬁnite  abelian  group.  Show  that  there  exists  an  abelian  extension  L/Q  with Galois group 
A. 

6.  Let  p 6

= 

q  be  primes  of  Q.

(a)  Show  that  the  ﬁelds  Qp  and  Qq  are  non-isomorphic. 
(b)  Show  that  the  only  automorphism  of  Qp  is the the identity. 

7. 

(a)	 Show  there  is  an  exact  sequence 

0  →  Zˆ →  AQ/Q →  R/Z →  0 

of  abelian topological groups.  Show that  AQ/Q  is  compact,  connected  and  uniquely  divisible,  i.e. 
the  multiplication  by  n  map  is  a  group  isomorphism. 
(b)  Let  m  | n  be  moduli.  Find  an  exact  sequence  connecting  Cm  with  Cn . 

8.  Let  L1 , . . . , Lr  be  cyclic  extensions  of  prime  degree  p  of  a  number  ﬁeld  K ,  such  that  Li  ∩ L′ 
i  =  K  for 
all  i,  where  L′ 
i  is  the  compositum  of  the  Lj  for  j  =6
i.  Show  that  there  are  inﬁnitely  many  primes  of 
K  which  are  nonsplit  in  L1  but  split  completely  in  the  other  Li .  Is  the  statement  still  true  if  we  relax 
the  condition  to  Li  ∩ Lj  =  K  for  i 
j ?= 

9.  Determine the  class group  of  K  =  Q(α) where  α  satisﬁes  x5  − x  + 1  = 0. 

10.  Let  K  be  a  number  ﬁeld  and  m  a  natural  number.  Suppose  that  for  all  but  ﬁnitely  many  primes  p 
of  OK ,  the  completion  Kp  contains  a  primitive  m’th  root  of  unity.  Show  that  K  contains  a  primitive 
m’th  root  of  unity.  Suppose  ℓ >  [K  :  Q].  Show  that  the  number  of  roots  of  unity  in  K  is  equal  to 
the  greatest  common  divisor  of  the  numbers  N (p) − 1,  where  p  ranges  over  all  primes  of  K  for  which 
OK /p  has  characteristic greater than  ℓ.

11.  Let  n  be  a  positive  integer  and  let  Sn  the  symmetric  group  on  n  letters. 

(a)  Let  G  ⊂  Sn  be  a  transitive  subgroup  that  is  generated  by  transpositions.  Show  that  G  =  Sn . 
(b)  Let  K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  degree  n  of  Q.  Suppose  that  the  discriminant  of  K  over  Q  is 
squarefree.  Show  that  the  Galois  closure  of  L  of  K  has degree  n!  over  Q,  with  Galois  group  Sn .
