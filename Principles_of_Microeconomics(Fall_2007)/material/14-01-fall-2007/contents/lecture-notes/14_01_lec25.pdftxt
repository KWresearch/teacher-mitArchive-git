1  Third  Degree  Price  Discrimination 

Third degree price discrimination is the practice of dividing  consumers into two 
or  more  groups  with  separate  demand  curves  and  charging  diﬀerent  prices  to 
each group (see Figure 1).  Now  maximize the proﬁt:

serves the second group, because the willingness to pay  of  the  ﬁrst group  is too 
low. 

2  Peak-Load  Pricing 

Producers  charge  higher  prices  during  peak  periods  when  capacity  constraints 
cause higher  M C . 

Example  (Movie Ticket).  Movie  ticket  is  more  expensive  in  the  evenings. 

Example  (Electricity).  Price  is  higher  during  summer  afternoons. 

For  each  time  period, 

M C  =  M R 

(see Figure 3).

3  Two-Part  Tariﬀ 

The  consumers are  charged both  an  entry (T ) and  usage (P ) fee,  that  is  to  say, 
a  fee  is  charged  upfront  for  right  to  use/buy  the  product,  and  an  additional  fee 
is charged for each  unit that the  consumer wishes to consume.  Assume that the 
ﬁrm  knows  consumer’s  demand  and  sets  same  price  for  each  unit  purchased. 

Example  (Telephone Service, Amusement Park.). 

When  there  is  only  one  consumer.  If  the  ﬁrm  sets  usage  fee 

consumer  consumes  Q∗  units (see Figure 4), and  the  ﬁrm can set entry  fee 

P  =  M C, 

and  extract  all  the  consumer  surplus. 

T  =  A, 

•  If  setting 

total  revenue  is


and  cost  is


then the proﬁt is


•  If  setting 

total  revenue  is


P1  > M C, 

R1  =  A1  +  P1  ×  Q1 ,


C1  =  M C  ×  Q1 ,


π1  =  A − B1 .


P2  < M C, 

R2  =  A2  +  P2  ×  Q2 ,

then the proﬁt is


C2  =  M C  ×  Q2 ,


π2  =  A − B2 .


Either  B1  or  B2  is positive,  so the best  unit price that  maximized  the producer 
surplus  is  exactly  M C .
