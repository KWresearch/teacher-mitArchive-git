Elasticities  of  Demand 

Elasticity.  Elasticity  measures  how  one  variable  responds  to  a  change  in  an­
other  variable,  namely  the  percentage  change  in  one  variable  resulting  a 
one  percentage  change  in  another  variable. 
(The  percentage  change  is 
independent  of  units.)

1  Price  Elasticity  of  Demand 

Price  elasticity  of  demand.  Price  elasticity  of  demand  measures  the  per­
centage change in quantity demanded  resulting from one percentage change 
in price.

Example  Calculation 

Figure  1  shows  a  demand  curve: 

When  the  price  changes  from  2  to  1,  the  price  elasticity  of  demand  is: 

Q(P ) = 8 − 2P.

Figure  1:  Price  Elasticity  of  Demand. 

If  the  direction  of  change  is  opposite,  from  1  to  2,  then  the  price  elasticity  of 
demand is:

The  two  quantities  are  diﬀerent.  To  solve  this  conﬂict,  consider  small  changes 
in  P  and  Q,  and  deﬁne:

Properties  of  Price  Elasticity  of  Demand 

1.  Price  elasticity  of  demand  is  usually  a  negative  number. 

2.  |EP | > 1 indicates that the good is price elastic, perhaps because the good 
has  many  substitutes;  |EP | <  1 indicates that the good is price inelastic, 
perhaps  because  the  good  has  few  substitutes. 

3.  Given  a  linear  demand  curve,  EP  is  not  a  constant  along  the  curve.  For 
example,  for  curve  in  Figure  1,  EP  =  −∞  at  top  portion,  but  zero  at 
bottom portion. 

4.  Discuss  two  extreme  situations:  |EP | =  0,  quantity  independent  of  price 
Figure  2  and  |EP | =  ∞,  quantity  very  sensitive  to  price.  See  Figure  3.

Q =  aP b ,

6.  How  do  total  consumer  expenditure  change  when  the  price  of  a  good 
changes?

•  If  |EP | > 1,  total  expenditure  decreases  when  price  increases; 
•  If  |EP | < 1,  total  expenditure  increases  when  price  increases. 
Example (Cell phone).  People need to do business in the morning, so  EP  is 
low, so cell phone companies increase the rate while customers will  expend 
more; but  EP  is  high  in  the  evening  since  people  do  not  have  to  talk,  so 
cell  phone  companies  lower  the  rate  to  encourage  customer  expenditure.

Income  Elasticity  of  Demand 

Income  elasticity  of  demand.  Income elasticity of demand  measures the per­
centage change in quantity demanded  resulting from one percentage change 
in  income.  Similarly,

3	 Cross  Price  Elasticity  of  Demand 

Cross  price  elasticity  of  demand.  Cross price elasticity of demand  measures 
the percentage change in quantity  demanded  of  a good (x) resulting  from 
one percentage  change in price  of  another good (y ).

•  If  y  is  a  substitute  of  x,  the  cross  price  elasticity  of  demand  is  positive. 

•  If  y  is  a  complement  of  x, the  cross price  elasticity  of demand is  negative. 

4	 Comparison Between Elasticity Over Short Run 
and  Long  Run 

Is  demand  more  elastic  in  the  long  run  or  short  run? 

Consumption  goods.  For  consumption  goods,  the  demand  is  more  elastic  in 
the  long  run.  Because  people  need  goods  for  daily  life  and  buy  them 
constantly,  the  short  run  demand  is  inelastic.  Faced  with  high  prices  in 
the  long  run,  they  may  change  habits  or  ﬁnd  more  substitutes.

4  Comparison  Between  Elasticity  Over  Short  Run  and  Long  Run  5 

Durable  goods.  For  durable  goods,  the  demand  is  more  elastic  in  the  short 
run.  Consider  cars.  If  price  of  of  cars  increase,  in  the  short  run  people 
might  use their  current  cars longer.  In the long  run, though, people have 
to  replace  their  cars.
