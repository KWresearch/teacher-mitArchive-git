1  Game  Theory 

In  monopolistic  competition  market,  there  are  many  sellers,  and  the  sellers  do 
not  consider their  opponents’  strategies; nonetheless,  in oligopoly market, there 
are  a  few  sellers,  and  the  sellers must  consider  their  opponents’  strategies.  The 
tool  to  analyze  the  strategies  is  game  theory. 
Game  theory  includes  the  discussion  of  noncooperative  game  and  coopera ­
tive game.  The former refers to a game in which negotiation and enforcement of 
binding  contracts between  players  is  not  possible;  the  latter  refers  to  a  game  in 
which  players  negotiate  binding  contracts  that  allow  them  to  plan  joint  strate ­
gies. 
A  game  consists  of  players,  strategies,  and  payoﬀs. 
Now  assume  that  in  a  game,  there  are  two  players, ﬁrm A  and  ﬁrm  B;  their 
strategies  are  whether  to  advertise  or  not;  consequently,  their  payoﬀs  can  be 
written  as 

and 

πA (A� s strategy , B �s strategy ) 

πB (A� s strategy , B �s strategy ) 

respectively. 
Now  let’s  represent  the  game  with  a  matrix  (see  Table  1).  The  ﬁrst  row  is  the 
situation that A advertises, and the  second row  is  the  situation  that A does not 
advertise;  the  ﬁrst  column  is  the  situation  that  B  advertises,  and  the  second 
column  is  the  situation  that B does  not  advertise.  The  cells  provide  the  payoﬀs 
under  each  situation.  The  ﬁrst  number  in  a  cell  is  ﬁrm  A’s  payoﬀ,  and  the 
second  number  is  ﬁrm  B’s  payoﬀ. 
Dominant  strategy  is  the  optimal  strategy  no  matter  what  the  opponent 
does.  If we  change  the  element  (20, 2)  to  (10, 2), no matter what  the  other  ﬁrm 
does, advertising is always better  for ﬁrm A (and ﬁrm B). Therefore, both ﬁrms 
have  a  dominant  strategy.

Table  1:  Payoﬀs  of  Firm A  and  B. 

When all players play dominant strategies, we call it equilibrium in dominant 
strategy. 
Now back to original case, B has dominant strategy, but A does not, because 

•	 if  B  advertises, A  had  better  advertise; 

•	 if  B  does  not  advertise, A  had  better  not  advertise. 

So  we  see  that  not  all  games  have  dominant  strategy.  However,  since  B  has 
dominant  strategy  and  would  always  advertise,  A  would  choose  to  advertise  in 
this  case. 
Now  consider  another  example.  Two  ﬁrms,  ﬁrm  1  and  ﬁrm  2,  can  produce 
crispy  or  sweet.  If  they  both  produce  crispy  or  sweet,  the  payoﬀs  are  (−5, −5); 
if  one  of  them  produces  crispy  while  the  other  produces  sweet,  the  payoﬀs  are 
(10, 10).

Table  2:  Payoﬀs  of  Firm  1  and  2. 

There is no dominant strategy for both ﬁrms.  We deﬁne another equilibrium 
concept  –  Nash  equilibrium. 
Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies such that each player is doing the best 
given  the  actions  of  its  opponents. 
In this case, there are two Nash equilibriums, (sweet, crispy) and (crispy , sweet). 

2  Oligopoly 

Small  number  of  ﬁrms,  and  production  diﬀerentiation  may  exist. 

Diﬀerent  Oligopoly  Models 

1.	 Cournot  Model:  ﬁrms  produce  the  same  good,  and  they  choose  the  pro ­
duction  quantity  simultaneously. 

2.	 Stackelberg Model:  ﬁrms  produce  the  same 

3.	 Bertrand Model:  ﬁrms produce the  same good, and they  choose the price.

2.1  Cournot  Model 

Example.  Market  has  demand 

with  two  ﬁrms,  so 

P  = 30 − Q, 

Q = Q1  + Q2 , 

and  assume  that  there  is  no  ﬁxed  cost  and marginal  cost, 

Firm  1  would  like  to maximize  its  proﬁt 

M C1  = M C2  = 0. 

or 

P  × Q1 , 

(30 − Q1  − Q2 ) × Q1 ; 

from  the 

d 
((30 − Q1  − Q2 ) × Q1 ) = 0, 
dQ1 
we  have  ﬁrm  1’s  reaction  function 

Q1  = 15 − 

Q2
2 

,

in  which  the  Q2  is  the  estimation  of  ﬁrm  2’s  production  by  ﬁrm  1. 
In  the  same  way,  ﬁrm  2’s  reaction  function  is 

Q2  = 15 − 

Q1
2 

,

in  which  the  Q1  is  the  expectation  of  ﬁrm  1’s  production  by  ﬁrm  2. 
At  equilibrium, ﬁrm 1 and ﬁrm 2 have correct expectation about the  other’s 
production,  that  is, 

Thus,  at  equilibrium, 

and 

Q1  = Q1 , 
Q2  = Q2 . 

Q1  = 10, 

Q2  = 10.
