1  Short  Run  Production  Function 

In  the  short  run,  the  capital  input  is  ﬁxed,  so  we  only  need  to  consider  the 
change  of  labor.  Therefore,  the  production  function 

q =  F (K, L) 

has  only  one  variable L (see Figure 1).

Some  properties  about  AP  and  M P  (see Figure 2).

Output  is  maximized. 

•  When 

AP  is increasing. 

M P  = 0, 

M P  > AP,

•  When 

AP  is decreasing.

•	 When


AP  is  maximized. 

M P  < AP,


M P  =  AP,


To  prove  this,  maximize  AP  by  ﬁrst  order  condition: 

=⇒ 

=⇒ 

=⇒ 

∂ q(L) 
∂L  L 

= 0 

∂ q  1

−

M P  =  AP. 
Example  (Chair Production.).  Note that here  APL  and  M PL  are not con­
tinuous,  so  the  condition  for  maximizing  APL  we  derived  above  does  not 
apply.

How many units of  K  can be reduced  to keep  Q constant  when we increase 
L  by  one  unit.  Like  M RS ,  we  also  have

Increasing  Returns to Scale. 

•	 A  production  function  is  said  to  have  increasing  returns  to  scale  if 

Q(2K, 2L) > 2Q(K, L), 

or 

Q(aK, aL) = 2Q(K, L), a < 2. 

•  One  big  ﬁrm  is  more  eﬃcient  than  many  small  ﬁrms. 

•  Isoquants get  closer  as  we  move  away from the  origin (see Figure 7).
