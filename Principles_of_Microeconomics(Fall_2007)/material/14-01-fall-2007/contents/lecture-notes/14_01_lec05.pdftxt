1  Utility  Function,  Deriving  MRS 

Examples  of  utility: 
Example  (Perfect  substitutes). 

U (x, y ) =  ax  +  by . 

Example  (Perfect  complements). 

U (x, y ) =  min{ax, by}. 

Example  (Cobb-Douglas Function). 

U (x, y ) =  Axb y . 
c

Example  (One good is bad). 

U (x, y ) =  −ax  +  by . 

An important thing  is to derive MRS. 

M RS  = 

dy 
− dx 

=  Slope  of  Indiﬀerence  Curve .

2  Budget  Constraint 

4 

Because  utility  is  constant  along  the  indiﬀerence  curve, 
u  = (x, y (x)) =  C, = ⇒ 
∂ u  dy 
∂ u 
+ 
= 0, = ⇒ 
∂ x 
∂ y  dx 
∂u 
∂x 
.∂u 
∂ y 

dy 
− dx 

= 

Thus, 

∂u 
M RS  =  ∂x  .∂u 
∂ y 

Example  (Sample  utility function). 
u(x, y ) =  xy 2 . 

Two  ways  to  derive  MRS: 
•  Along  the  indiﬀerence  curve 

xy 2  =  C. 
 
r
c 
x 

y  = 

. 

Thus, 

M RS d  =

dy 
− dx 

= 

√c
2x3/2 

= 

y
2x 

.

•  Using  the  conclusion  above 
M RS  =

∂u 
∂x 
∂u 
∂ y 

=

y
2xy 

= 

y
2x 

.

2  Budget  Constraint 

The  problem  is  about  how  much  goods  a  person  can  buy  with  limited  income. 
Assume:  no saving, with income  I , only  spend  money  on goods  x  and  y  with 
the price  Px  and  Py . 
Thus  the  budget  constraint  is 

Px  x  +  Py  y  � I . 
·
· 
Suppose  Px  = 2,  Py  = 1,  I  = 8, then 

2x  +  y  � 8. 

The  slope  of  budget  line  is 

dy 
− dx 
Bundles  below  the  line  are  aﬀordable. 
Budget  line  can  shift: 

= 

Px 
.

•	 Change in Income Assume  I = 6, then 2x + y  = 6.  The  budget  line  shifts 
right  which  means  more  income  makes  the  aﬀordable  region  larger. 

′ 
•	 Change  in  Price  Assume  Px  =  2,  then  2x  + 2y  =  8.  The  budget  line 
changes  which  means  lower  price  makes  the  aﬀordable  region  larger. 

3  Optimization:  Interior  Solution 

Now  the  consumer’s  problem  is:  how  to  be  as  happy  as  possible  with  limited 
income.  We  can  simplify  the  problem  into  language  of  mathematics: 
 


 


. 
 


Since  the preference has  non-satiation property,  only (x, y )  on  the  budget  line 
can  be  the  solution.  Therefore,  we  can  simplify  the  inequality  to  an  equality: 

  xPx  +  yPy  � I 
x  � 0 
y  � 0 

max  U (x, y ) sub ject to 
x,y	

xPx  +  yPy  =  I . 

First,  consider  the  case  where  the  solution  is  interior,  that  is,  x >  0  and  y >  0. 
Example  solutions:

Figure  8:  Interior  Solution  to  Consumer’s  Problem 

From  Figure  8,  the  utility  function  reaches  its  maximum  when  the  indif­
ferent  curve  and  constraint  line  are  tangent,  namely: 

–  If 

Px 
Py 

=  M RS  =

∂ u/∂ x 
∂ u/∂ y 

= 

ux 
. 
uy 

Px 
Py 

>

ux 
,
uy 

then  one  should  consume  more  y , less  x. 
–  If 

ux 
,
uy 

Px 
Py 

<

then one should  consume more  x, less  y . Intuition behind  P
=  M RS : 
x
Py 
Px  is the market price of  x  in terms of  y , and MRS is the price of  x  in 
Py 
terms of  y  valued  by  the  individual.  If  Px /Py  > M RS ,  x  is relatively 
expensive  for  the  individual,  and  hence  he  should  consume  more  y . 
On  the  other  hand,  if  Px /Py  < M RS ,  x  is  relatively  cheap  for  the 
individual,  and  hence  he  should  consume  more  x. 

Method  2:  Use  Lagrange  Multipliers 

• 

L(x, y , λ) =  u(x, y ) − λ(xPx  +  yPy  − I ).

In  order  to  maximize  u,  the  following  ﬁrst  order  conditions  must  be  satis­
ﬁed: 

∂L 
∂ x 
∂L 
∂ y 

ux 
= 0 = 
⇒  Px 
uy 
= 0  = ⇒  Py 

=  λ, 

=  λ, 

∂L 
∂ λ 

= 0  = ⇒ xPx  +  yPy  − I  = 0. 

Thus  we  have 

Method 3 

• 

Since  xPx  +  yPy  +  I  = 0,


Px 
Py 

= 

ux 
. 
uy 

y  = 

I  − xPx

Py 

. 

Then  the  problem  can  be  written  as 

max  u(x, y ) =  u(x, 
x,y 

I  − xPx 
). 
Py 

At  the  maximum,  the  following  ﬁrst  order  condition  must  be  satisﬁed: 

ux  +  uy (

∂ y 
∂ x

Px 
) =  ux  +  uy (− Py 
) = 0. 
= ⇒ 
ux 
Px 
= 
.
