1  Reducing  Risk:  Insurance 

Reducing  Risk: 

•	 Diversiﬁcation 

•	 Insurance 
Example  (House insurance).  Assume  that  one  house  has  the  proba­
bility  p  to  catch  ﬁre,  with  loss  l  each  time,  i.e.  the  owner’s  wealth 
will  reduce from  y1  to  y2  =  y1 − l. If  the owner pay premium  k  to buy 
an  insurance  which  covers  the  loss  l  when  there  is  a  ﬁre,  her  wealth 
will be  y3  =  y1  −  k , for the situations listed (see Table  1). 

No Fire

No  Insurance 
y1 
y2  =  y1  −  l

Insurance 
y3  =  y1  −  k 
y3  =  y1  −  k 

Table  1:  Wealth  of  House  Owner  in  Diﬀerent  Situations. 

Assuming  the  owner  is  a  risk-averse,  the  utility  function  is  concave. 

u ′′ (y ) < 0 

If  the  expected  wealth  at  both  situations  is  equal, 

y3  = (1 −  p) ×  y1  +  p ×  y2 . 

We have


k =  p ×  l.

The  insurance  premium  is  equal  to  the  expected  payout  by  the  in­
surance  company,  and  we  say  the  insurance  is  actuarially  fair. 
Since  the  person  is  risk-averse, 

u(y3 ) > (1 −  p) ×  u(y1 ) + p ×  u(y2). 

she  will  choose  to  buy  insurance. 
If  the  insurance  is  actuarially  unfair, 

k > p ×  l. 

Then 

y3  < (1 −  p) ×  y1  +  p ×  y2 . 
We  do  not  know  if  the  person  wants  to  buy  or  not  until  we  get 
her  speciﬁc  utility  function,  but  it  is  easy  to  imagine  she  may  buy 
insurance if  k  is  close  to  pl. 
Now  we  consider  what  is  the  maximum  insurance  premium  that  the 
companies  can  charge  and  the  costumer  is  still  willing  to  buy  the 
′ 
insurance. 
In  this  case,  let  y3  be  the  house  owner’s  wealth  after 
being  charged  the maximum premium.  Then, (Figure  1) 
′ 
u(y3) =  pu(y2 ) + (1 −  p)u(y1 ). 

Thus the  maximum insurance premium  charged is 
k ′  =  y1 − y3 
′  =  y1 − E (y ) + Risk P remium =  p ×  l + Risk P remium 
So are insurance companies more willing  to take risk? If  not, why  are 
they  willing to sell insurance? The Law of Large Numbers can explain 
this.  Let L be the total loss from n customers, It is a random variable. 
The  average  loss  shared  by  each  customer  is  L ,  and  E ( L ) =  n ×  p. 
n 
n
The  expected  payout  for  L  by  the  insurance  company  will  be 

When 

E (L) =  n ×  p ×  l 

n → ∞ 

The  probability  that  the  loss  shared  by  each  customer  is  equal  to  a 
ﬁxed  number  pl  is  almost  1.  (Figure  2) 
L 
P robability ( =  p ×  l) →n→∞  1.

Note that this argument only  applies to the situation when customers’

ﬁre  accident  events  are  independent.

Example  (Illegal parking).  Government  has  two  reasonable  methods

to punish illegal parking.

–  Hire more police, get caught almost for sure but  ﬁne is low. 
–  Hire  less  police,  get  caught  sometimes  but  the  ﬁne  is  high. 
The  latter  might  be  more  eﬀective  since  people  are  risk  averse  abd 
are  afraid  to  take  risk  of  being  ﬁned  to  park  illegally.

2	 Outline  of  Producer  Theory 

•  Production  Function:  Inputs  to  Outputs 

•  Given Quantity  Produced, Choose Inputs to Minimize the Cost 

•  Choose Quantity  to Maximize Firm’s Proﬁt 

The Production Function is 

The two inputs: 

q =  F (k , L). 

k :  Capital 

L:  Labor 

It  is  easier  to  change  labor  level  but  not  to  change  capital  in  a  short  time. 

Short  run.  Period  of  time  in  which  quantity  of  one  or  more  inputs  cannot  be 
changed.  For  example,  capital  is  ﬁxed  and  labor  is  variable  in  the  short 
run. 

Long  run.	 Period  of  time  need  to  make  all  production  inputs  variable.  In  the 
long  run,  both  capital  and  labor  are  variable.
