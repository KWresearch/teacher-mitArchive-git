1  Supply  of  Labor 

We derive the  supply  of labor by  solving  consumers’  utility  maximization prob­
lems. 
Two  variables determining  the  utility  are leisure (L),  which  is  measured  by 
hours,  and income (Y ); the  prices  are  w  and  1  respectively. 
To  maximize  u(L, Y ),  we  have 

∂u 
∂L  =  w. 
∂u 
∂Y 

If  w  increases, on one hand, higher wages encourage people to work  more (point 
A  to point  B ),  which  is  a  substitution  eﬀect;  on  the  other  hand,  higher  wages 
allow the  worker to purchase more goods, including  leisure,  which  reduces work 
hours (point  B  to point  C ),  which is  an income  eﬀect (see Figure 1). 
When the wage is higher, if  the substitution eﬀect exceeds the income eﬀect, 
labor  supply  increases,  and  leisure  decreases;  if  the  income  eﬀect  exceeds  the 
substitution  eﬀect, labor  supply  decreases,  and leisure increases (see Figure 2). 
Like  product  markets,  competitive,  monopolistic,  and  monopsonistic  mar­
kets  are  types  of  factor  markets. 
In  a  competitive  factor  market,  if  the  product  market  is  also  competitive, 

M RPL  =  P  ×  M PL . 

If  the  product  market  is  monopolistic, 

M RPL  =  M R ×  M PL  =  P (1 −

) ×  M PL .

1.1  Factor  Competitive 

Competitive  market is  most  eﬃcient,  and there is  no deadweight loss (see Fig­
ure 3). 
When  M R < P , both  w  and  L  decrease;  the  market  is  then  not  as  eﬃcient 
as  competitive  market,  and has deadweight loss (see Figure 4). 

1.2  Factor  Monopsony 

Marginal  Value  equals  the  demand.  Marginal  Expenditure 

M E =

∂PS (Q)Q 
∂Q 

= 

∂PS
∂Q 

Q +  PS  > PS . 

Because  L  is determined by

(see Figure 5). 
One  example  of  factor  monopsonist  is  the  government  hiring  soldiers.

1.3  Factor  Monopoly 

An  example  of  monopoly power in factor  markets involves labor  unions. 
Economic  rent  is  the  diﬀerence  between  payments  to  a  factor  of  production 
and  the  minimum  payment  that  must  be  spent  to  obtain  the  factor;  it  is  like 
producer  surplus in  a product  market (see Figure 6).

Figure  6:  Economic  Rent. 

When  some  workers lose their jobs,  remaining  workers have higher  wages. 
If  the  union tries to maximize the  number of  workers hired, it should  set the 
wage  and  labor  employed  w ∗  and  L∗ ;  if  the  union  tries  to  maximize  economic 
rent,  it  should  set  the  wage  and  labor  employed  w1  and  L1 . 

and 

∗ 
w1  > w  , 

L1  < L∗ 

(see Figure 7). 
It  is  hard  to  say  which  one  is  better  for  the  workers. 
Now  consider  a  model  of  union  workers  and  non-union  workers.  Assume 
the  demand  for  union  workers  is  DU ,  and  the  demand  for  non-union  workers  is 
DN U .  The  total  market  demand 

is  ﬁxed. 

DL  =  DU  +  DN U

Figure  7:  Monopoly  Power  of  Sellers  of  Labor. 

When  a  monopolistic  union  raises  the  wage  rate  in  the  unionized  sector  of 
the economy from  w ∗  to  wU , employment in that  sector falls; for the total  supply 
of  labor  to  remain  unchanged,  the  number  of  non-union  workers  increases  and 
the  wage  in  the  non-unionized  sector  must  fall  from  w ∗  to  wN U  (see Figure 8). 
Assume  the  total  supply  of  workers  is  60;  the  demands  for  nonunion  and 
union  workers  are 

1 
wN U  = 30 −  LN U ,
2 
wU  = 30 − LU . 

•  When  the  union  does  not  intervene, 

Thus


and


Then


which gives


wN U  =  wU  =  w. 

LN U  = 60 − 2w,


LU  = 30 − w.


L = 90 − 3w = 60,


w = 10,

and therefore


LU  = 20,


LN U  = 40. 

•	 When  the  union  maximizes  the  total  wage  of  union  workers  as  a  monop­
olist,  the  ﬁrst  order  condition  is 

d

(wU  ×  LU ) =

LU  = 15;


wU  = 15.


LN U  = 45,


wN U  = 7.5.

Q = 10L − L2 , 

P  = 1. 

M RPL  =  M PL  ×  M R = 10 − 2L. 

w  is  marginal  cost  of  hiring  labor,  thus
