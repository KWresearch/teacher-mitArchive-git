1  Dominant  Firm  Model 

The  dominant  ﬁrm  model  is  the  model  that  in  some  oligopolistic  markets,  one 
large ﬁrm has a ma jor share of  total  sales, and  a group  of  smaller  ﬁrms supplies 
the  remainder  of  the  market.  The  large  ﬁrm  has  power  to  set  a  price  that 
maximizes its own proﬁts.  A dominant  ﬁrm exists because it has lower marginal 
cost  than  the  other  fringe  ﬁrms. 
Assume  the  fringe  ﬁrms’  total  supply  is  SF , the market demand is  DM , then 
the dominant  ﬁrm’s demand is (see Figure 1) 

DD  =  DM  − SF . 

Knowing  DD ,  we  can  derive  M RD .  The  dominant  ﬁrm  produces  at  a  quantity 
QD  that  satisﬁes 

M RD  =  M CD . 
Correspondingly, the price is  P ∗ . The fringe  ﬁrm’s supply  curve thus shows  QF . 
Furthermore, the total quantity  is 

QT  =  QF  +  QD . 

Example  (OPEC).  OPEC  is  an  example  of  a  successful  cartel,  which  can  be 
regarded  as  a  dominant  ﬁrm. 

Cartels  are  more  likely  to  succeed  if 

•  demand  is  inelastic,  and 

•  supply  of  non-Cartel producers is inelastic.

2  Factor  Market 

The  last  chapters  were  about  product  market,  or  output  market,  in  which 

•  individuals  are  buyers,  and 

•  ﬁrms  are producers; 

we  start  to  discuss  factor  markets,  or  input  markets,  in  which 

•  individuals  are producers,  and 

•  ﬁrms  are  buyers.


Firms  need  labor  and  capital  to  produce.

1.  Demand  of  Labor 

2.  Supply  of  Labor 

2.1  Demand  of  Labor 

Demands  of  labor  are  diﬀerent  in  short  run  and  long  run  markets,  and  condi­
tional  and  unconditional  market (see Table 1).  Firms  use labor  and  capital  as 
input.

Table  1:  Demand  of  Labor. 

Short  Run  Demand  of  Labor.  Only  labor  is  variable. 
The prices for  L  and  K  are  w  and  r  respectively.


Deﬁne  marginal  revenue product  of labor  M RPL  to  be  additional  revenue

from  an  additional  unit  of  labor.


M PL  is  the  additional  output  obtained  from  an  additional  unit  of  labor;

M R is the additional revenue from an additional  unit  of  output. Therefore,


M RPL  =

dR 
dL 

= 

dR ∂Q 
dQ  ∂L 

=  M R × M PL . 

Firm  chooses  Q  such that 

w =  M RPL (L), 

so the marginal  revenue and  marginal  cost  at hiring  one more unit  of labor 
are  the  same. 

•  If  output  market  is  competitive, 

if  it  is  not  competitive, 

M R =  P ; 

M R < P 

(see  Figure  2 and  3). 
•  Given  w,  we  derive  the  ﬁrm’s  demand  for  labor  from 

w =  M RPL (L). 

M RPL  decreases in  L;  therefore,  M RPL  is  the  ﬁrm’s  short  run  de­
mand  curve. 

Long  Run  Demand  of  Labor.  Both  K  and  L  are  variable. 
w decreases then M C  decreases, Q increases, and L increases. With higher 
L,  M PK  increases,  so  the  ﬁrm  uses  more  K ,  and  then  M PL  increases 
further, and  the  ﬁrm hires more labor.  Thus, the demand  of labor is more 
elastic than that in  short  run (see Figure 5).

Figure  6:  Unconditional  on  Output  Market  Price. 

Unconditional  on  Output  Market  Price.  The discussion before was based 
on  the  assumption  that  the  output  price  is  ﬁxed.  Now  consider  the  case 
when  the  output  price  is  unconditional  so  that  it  is  not  ﬁxed. 
If  w  decreases,  L  increases  and  Q  increases,  and  so  P  decreases;  with

M RPL  decreases,  Q  and  L  decrease.

The  demand  is  less  elastic  than  when  output  P  is  ﬁxed (see Figure 6).
