1	 Relation  Between  Long  Run  Cost  Short  Short 
Run Cost 

Since  ﬁrms  can  change  capital  in  the  long  run,  the  long  run  cost  is  always  no 
more  than  the  short  run  cost: 

CLR(q) � CSR,K (q). 

Figure 1 shows three short-run total  cost given diﬀerent  capital level.  In the long 
run,  ﬁrms  will  choose  the  capital  level  which  minimizes  the  total  cost.  Thus, 
the  long-run  total  cost  is  equal  to  the  minimum  of  all  possible  short-run  total 
cost,  and  so  long  run  total  cost  is  the  envelope  of  all  short  run  total  costs. 
Likewise,  long-run  average  cost  is  the  envelope  of  all  short  run  average  cost. 
From  Figure  1,  we  know  for  a  given  product  q ,  long  run  marginal  cost  is  equal 
to the corresponding  short run marginal  cost.  Long  run total  cost and  marginal 
cost  also  have  the  following  relation:  (see  Figure  2) 

•  If 

LAC  is decreasing;


•  if 

LAC  is  minimized;


•  if 

LAC  is increasing.


LM C  < LAC,


LM C  =  LAC,


LM C  > LAC,

2  Economies  of  Scale 

•  Constant  economies  of  scale: 

C (aq) =  aC (q), a > 1,


and  in  this  case,  AC  is  constant;


•	 Economies  of  scale:


C (aq) < aC (q), a > 1,


and  in  this  case,  AC  is decreasing; 

•  Diseconomies  of  scale: 

C (aq) > aC (q), a > 1,


and  in  this  case,  AC  is increasing.

3  Economies  of  Scope,  Learning 

Economies  of  Scope.  When  producing  more  than  one  type  of  product  that 
are  closely linked, the  cost is lower than  when producing  them  separately. 

Product  Transformation  Curve.  Shows various combinations of outputs that 
can  be  produced  with  a  given  set  of  inputs.

Example (Product Transformation Curve with Economies of Scope).  To produce 
1  car  and  1  truck,  if  we  produce  them  separately,  we  need  2  units  of  K  and 2 
units of  L; but if we produce them together, we only  need 1.5  units of  K  and 1.5 
units  of  L  (see  Figure  4).  In  this  case,  it  is  cheaper  to  produce  them  together; 
thus  the  ﬁrm  has  economies  of  scope.

Figure  4:  Product  Transformation  Curve  with  Economies  of  Scope. 

In  the  case  of  economies  of  scope,  the  product  transformation  curve  is  neg­
atively  sloped  and  concave. 
The  degree  of  economies  of  scope  is  deﬁned  as  follows: 

SC  = 

C (q1 ) + C (q2 ) − C (q1 , q2 )
C (q1 , q2 ) 

. 

•  If 

it  is  economies  of  scope;


•  if 

it  is  diseconomies  of  scope.


SC  > 0,


SC  < 0,


The learning curve for a  ﬁrm is shown in Figure 5, with  the  ﬁrm’s cumulative 
output  as  the  vertical  coordinate,  and  amount  of  inputs  needed  to  produce  a 
unit  of  output  as  the  horizontal  coordinate. 
Learning  causes  a  diﬀerence  in  cost  between  the  new  ﬁrm  and  the  old  ﬁrm 
(see Figure 6).
