1  Tax 

Government imposes  a $1  tax  on  every  unit  sold (see Figure 1),  as discussed in 
Lecture  17.  The  buyer’s  price  is  shown  on  the  y-axis.  The  consumer  surplus

ΔC S  =  −(A +  B ), 

ΔP S =  −(C +  D). 

ΔG = A + C.

So the deadweight loss is 

DW L =  B +  D. 

The burden  of  a tax is shared by  consumers and producers;  the relative amount 
borne  by  consumers  and  producers  depends  on  relative  elasticities  of  demand 
and  supply. 

•  If the demand is inelastic (see Figure 2),

Figure  2:  Tax  Burden  on  Buyers,  Relative  Inelastic  Demand  Curve. 

ΔC S  =  −(A +  B ),


ΔP S  =  −(C +  D),


buyers  bear  most  of  the  burden  of  the  tax.


•	 If the  supply  is inelastic (see Figure 3),


ΔC S  =  −(A +  B ),


ΔP S  =  −(C +  D),


producers  bear  most  of  the  burden  of  the  tax. 

Pass-through fraction is the percentage of a tax borne by  consumers.  It tells the 
fraction of  tax  ”passed  through”  to consumers through higher price.  If  ED  = 0, 
say  the demand is perfectly inelastic (see Figure 4), buyers bear  all  of  the  tax 
burden: 

ES 
ES  −  ED 

= 1.

Figure  5:  Subsidy. 

2  Subsidy 

Government subsidizes $1 for each  unit  sold (see Figure 5).  In this  case,  sellers’ 
price is higher than buyers’  price: 

PB  =  PS  + 1. 

The  consumer  surplus  increases  by 

ΔC S  =  A +  B ; 

and  the  producer  surplus  increases  by 

ΔP S  =  C +  D. 

Government  expenditure  equals  the  whole  area  between  PB  and  PS  under  the 
quantity  Q1 

ΔG =  −(A +  B +  C +  D +  E ). 

The deadweight loss is 

DW L =  E . 

Likewise  we  can  discuss  the  beneﬁt  of  subsidy: 

•  if  ED  is small, namely, the demand is more inelastic, the beneﬁt  of  subsidy 
ES 
goes  mostly  to  buyers; 

•  if  ED  is  large,  namely,  the  supply  is  more  inelastic,  the  beneﬁt  of  subsidy 
ES 
goes  mostly  to  sellers.

3 General Equilibrium 

5 

3  General  Equilibrium 

Partial  equilibrium.  Ignores  eﬀects  form  other  markets. 

General  equilibrium.  Simultaneous  determination  of  the  prices  and  quanti­
ties  in  all  relevant  markets,  taking  into  account  feedback  eﬀects. 

Feedback  eﬀect.  The  price  or  quantity  adjustment  in  one  market  caused  by 
price  and  quantity  adjustments  in  related  markets. 

Example  (DVD and Movie Tickets Markets).  The price of  a DVD is $3, and  the 
price of  a movie ticket is $6  at equilibrium.  Now tax $1  on the  movie ticket (see 
Figure  6).  The  speciﬁc  process  of  price  change  is  listed  as  follows: 

MOVIE TICKET  : 

′ 
SM  →  SM , 
Price  change:6  →  6.35; 

DVD  : 

The  price  change  of  movie  tickets  shifts  the  demand  curve  of  DVD. 

′  , 
DV  →  DV 

Price  change:3  →  3.5; 

MOVIE TICKET  : 

The  price  change  of  DVD  shifts  the  demand  curve  of  movie  tickets. 

DM

→  D ′ 
M , 

Price  change:6.35  →  6.75; 

and  so  on.  The  ﬁnal  equilibrium  prices  are 

P (M OV I ET I CK ET ) = 6.85; 

P (DV D) = 3.58. 

If  we  ignore  the  feedback  eﬀects,  we  might  underestimate  the  price  change 
bought by  the tax.

4  Exchange  Economy 

Assume that: 

•	 there  are  two  consumers  A  and  B; 

•	 there  are  two  goods,  food  and  clothing; 

•	 the  quantities  of  food  and  clothing  are  10  and  6,  and  A  has  7  food  and  1 
clothing,  while  B  has  3  food  and  5  clothing; 

•	 they  know  each  others’  preferences; 

•  transaction  cost  is  zero.
