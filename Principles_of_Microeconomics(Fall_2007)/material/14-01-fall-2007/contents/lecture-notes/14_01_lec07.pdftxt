1  Substitution Eﬀect, Income Eﬀect, Giﬀen Goods 

Substitution  and  Income  Eﬀects 

The  impact  of  price  change  on  quantity  demanded  are  divided  into  two  eﬀects: 

Substitution  eﬀect.  Substitution  eﬀect  is  the  change  in  an  item’s  consump­
tion associated  with  a change in the item’s price with  the utility level held 
constant. 

Income  eﬀect.  Income  eﬀect  is  a  change  in  an  item’s  consumption  associated 
with  a  change in purchasing power  with the price held  constant. 

Figure  1  shows  the  two  eﬀects:  L  is  the  old  budget  line.  Px  decreases,  and 
hence  the  new  budget  line  is  L′ .  A  is  the  optimal  consumption  before  price 
change,  and  C  is  the  optimal  consumption  after  price  change.  L′′  is  a  line  that 
has  the  same  slope  as  L′  and  is  tangent  with  the  green  indiﬀerence  curve  that 
passes through  A,  and  B  is the tangent point. 
•	 The  change  from  A  to  B  is  because  of  the  substitution  eﬀect; 
•  The  change  from  B  to  C  is  because  of  the  income  eﬀect. 
So  the  total  eﬀect  is  point  A  moving  to  C . 

Inferior  Good  and  Giﬀen  Good 

Now  consider  diﬀerent  positions  of  C  (Figure  1): 
•	 The  income  eﬀect  is  B  changing  to  C .  In  this  case,  an  increase  in  income 
causes  an  increase  in  the  demand  of  x.  x  is  a  normal good.

•	 The  income  eﬀect  is  B  changing  to  C ′  or  C ′′ .  In  these  cases,  an  increase 
in  income  causes  a  decrease  in  the  demand  of  x.  x  is  an  inferior  good; 
•	 If  the total  eﬀect is  A changing  to  C ′′ ,  such  that a decrease in price causes 
a  decrease  in  the  demand,  we  call  x  is  a  Giﬀen  good.

Table  1:  Normal  Good  and  Inferior  Good 

In  Table  1,  if  x  is  a  normal  good,  both  substitution  and  income  eﬀects 
increase its quantity;  if  x  is  an  inferior  good,  discuss  as  follows: 

1.  substitution  eﬀect  >  income  eﬀect

quantity  increases

→ 
2.  substitution  eﬀect  <  income  eﬀect 
quantity decreases. This unusual good is called a Giﬀen good.  A Giﬀen 
→ good  must  be  an  inferior  good,  but  an  inferior  good  is  not  necessarily  a 
Giﬀen good.

Example  (Giﬀen Good Example: Irish Potato Famine).  People consumed lots of 
potato but little meat (and other food)  since meat  was more expensive.  Price of 
potato rose.  People had less money to consume meat, so they  ate more potatoes 
instead  of  meat.

i.e.  the  solution  is  at  point  A: (4, 1).

If  price  of  x  changes to 2,  Px ′  = 2,  then  the  new  optimal  solution  is:

i.e.  the  solution is  at point  C : ( ,4).  Try  to  ﬁnd  out  the  substitution  eﬀect,  i.e.

the  change  from  A  to  B .

At  B ,  the  slope  of  the  indiﬀerence  curve  equals  the  slope  of  the  new  budget

constraint.

2  From  Individual  Demand  to  Market  Demand 

Assume  in  a  market  there  are  two  individuals  A  and  B.  And  their  demand 
functions  are: 

QA  = 1 − P, 
1 
P. 
QB  = 
1 − 2 
When  P < 1,  both  individuals  consume,  and  the  market  demand  is  the  sum  of 
the individual demands: 

2 
Q =  QA  +  QB  = 2 −  P. 
3 
However, if  P  is  larger  than  1,  only  B  consumes,  so  the  market  demand  equals 
the  demand  of  B.  Thus,  the  market  demand  function  is 
 
�

if  P  � 1 
if  P > 1 

. 

Q =

This  is  shown  in  Figure  4.

Willingness to Pay.  The  sum  of  the  ‘values’  of  each  of  the  units  that  con­
sumers  consume. 

Consumer Surplus.  The diﬀerence between Willingness to Pay and the actual 
Expenditure. 

Example.  Figure  5  shows  the  demand  curve  of  a  good.  Assume  now  the  price 
is  15,  then  only  the  highest  6  individuals  consume: 

W I LLIN GN ESS  T O P AY  = 20 + 19 + 18 + 17 + 16 + 15  = 105. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  expenditure  is 

EX P EN DI T U RE = 6 × 15  = 90. 

Therefore, 

CON SU M ER SU RP LU S = 105 − 90  = 15.
