1  Returns  to  Scale 

Increasing  Returns  to  Scale 

(Lecture 11) 

Constant  Returns  to  Scale 

•  Doubling  the  inputs  leads  to  double  the  output: 

Q(2K, 2L) = 2Q(K, L). 

•  One  big  ﬁrm  is  as  good  as  many  small  ﬁrms. 

•  Isoquants  are  equally  distant  apart (see Figure 1). 

Decreasing  Returns  to  Scale 

•  Doubling  the inputs leads to an output less than twice the original  output: 

Q(2K, 2L) <  2Q(K, L). 

•  Small  ﬁrms  are  more  eﬃcient. 

•  Isoquants become further  apart (see Figure 2).

Example  (Cobb-Douglas Production Function.). 

Q(K, L) =  ALαK β  . 

We  double  both  inputs  to  see  what  type  of  returns  to  scale  the  production 
function has.

2 Production Function Derivation 

Assume that the ﬁrm has two technologies 
outputs  are 

A

and 

B

, and the corresponding 

qA  = min{ 

qB  = min{ 

x y 
,  },
2 1
x y 
,  },
1 2
where the inputs  x  and y  are perfect  complements (see Figure 3). 
To derive production function, we must know which technology the  ﬁrm chooses. 
If  the  ﬁrm  choose  either  A  or  B ,  but  not  both,  the  isoquant  curve  for  the 
production function is the black line (see Figure 3).  This isoquant  curve is  not 
convex.  However,  the  ﬁrm  can  adopt  technologies  at  the  same  time,  and  this 
makes the isoquants  convex (see Figure 4). 
Thus the production function is: 
 
  min{ x  ,  y }, when  x >  2y .

3  Cost  of  Production 

Cost  comes  from  factor  price  and  how  many  units  are  used. 

Accounting  Cost.  Actual  expenses  plus  depreciation. 

Economic  Cost.  Cost  to  a  ﬁrm  of  using  resources  in  production.  Also  called 
opportunity  cost,  the  most  valuable  forgone  alternative. 

Wage  Transportation  Cost  Accounting  Cost  Opportunity  Cost

Job 1 
Job 2 

Table  1:  Accounting  Cost  and  Opportunity  Cost. 

Example  (Two job opportunities (see Table 1)).  If  the person accepts Job

2,  the  most  valuable  forgone  opportunity  is  Job  1.

Opportunity  cost  does  not  really  happen  but  must  be  considered.


Sunk  Cost.  Expenditure  that  has  been  made  and  cannot  be  recovered. 
Example  (Two  building  choices).  A  ﬁrm  has  two  building  choices.  For 
Building  1,  they  have  paid  500,000,  and  will  pay  5,000,000  in  the  future; 
for  Building  2,  they  have  not  paid  anything,  and  will  pay  5,300,000  in 
the  future.  Although  Building  2  is  cheaper  than  Building  1,  the  ﬁrm  will 
choose  Building  1  because  the  500,000  is  sunk. 

Total  Cost. 

Total Cost  = Variable Cost + Fixed Cost. 

Fixed  Cost.  A  cost  that  is  actually  incurred,  but  independent  of  the  level  of 
output. 

Variable  Cost.  A  cost  that  is  actually  incurred,  and  dependent  of  the  level  of 
output.

Example  (Short Run).  Capital  K  is  ﬁxed,  and  Labor  L  is  variable;  hence,

the  cost  of  K  is  a  ﬁxed  cost,  and  the  cost  of  L  is  a  variable  cost.


Here  is  another  deﬁnition  of  sunk  cost.


Sunk  Cost.  A  ﬁxed  cost  which  is  also  independent  of  output,  but  whose  cost 
is  not  incurred,  because  of  no  cash  outlay  and  no  opportunity  cost. 
Usually  ﬁxed  costs  are  considered  sunk  costs  because  they  happen  before 
production begins.
