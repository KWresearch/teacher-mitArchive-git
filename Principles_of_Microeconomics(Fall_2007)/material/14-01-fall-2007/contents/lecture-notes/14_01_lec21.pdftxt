1  Why  Markets  Fail 

1.1  Market  Power 

Ineﬃciency  arises  when  a  producer  or  supplier  of  a  factor  input  has  market 
power, for  example,  monopoly power, that  can proﬁtably  charge a price greater 
than  marginal  cost. 

1.2 

Incomplete  Information 

For  example,  in  the  second-hand  car  market,  sellers  know  more  about  the  cars 
than  buyers.  Final  allocation  might  be  ineﬃcient  when  there  is  incomplete 
information. 

1.3  Externalities 

Consumption  or  production  has  indirect  eﬀect  on  other  consumption  or  pro­
duction,  which  is  not  reﬂected  in  market  prices.  An  example  is  air  and  water 
pollution  by  a  factory. 

1.4  Public  Goods 

For  one  ﬁrm’s  new  technology,  others  may  copy  it  if  there  is  no  patent  law;  all 
ﬁrms  are  thus  waiting  for  others  to  invent.
