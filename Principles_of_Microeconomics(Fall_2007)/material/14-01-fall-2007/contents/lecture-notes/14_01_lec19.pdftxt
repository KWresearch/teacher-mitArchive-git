1  Exchange  Economy 

In the Edgeworth box (see Figure 1) given  endowment  E ,  the  area  between  A’s 
and B’s utility  curves contains all beneﬁcial  trades, but  not  all  are eﬃcient;  that 
is to say, both A and B  are better oﬀ in this area, but they  will keep trading  until 
they  cannot  make  both  of  them  better.  Then  the  possible  eﬃcient  allocation 
given  the  endowment  E  should  satisfy  that: 

•  there  is  no  more  room  for  trade, 

•  thus  M RSA  =  M RSB . 

2  Contract  Curve 

Contract  curve  shows  all  possible  eﬃcient  allocations;  it  contains  all  points  of 
tangency  between A’s  and B’s indiﬀerence  curves (see Figure 2). 

3  General  Equilibrium  in  a  Competitive  Market 

Assume  that  consumers  are  price-takers.  There  are  two  consumers,  A  and  B, 
and  two  goods,  X  and  Y,  in  the  market.  The  total  endowment  of  X  is  x  units,

and  the  total  endowment  of  Y  is  y  units.  Obviously,  demand  equals  supply  at 
equilibrium.  We  denote  the  equilibrium  state  by 

(P
∗
∗
, P
x 
y 

, (x 
A , y A
∗
∗

), (x 
B , y B
∗
∗

)).

If  we  suppose  A  has  one  unit  of  X  and  two  units  of  Y  initially,  the  budget 
constraint is 

xAPx  +  yAPy  =  Px  + 2Py , 

and divide it by  Py , 

Px 
xA  +  yA  = 
Py 

Px 
Py 
P .  For  convenience,  we  usually  set  P ∗ 
so  we  only  care  about  the  price  ratio  P
x
y
y 
to  1  so  that  the  expression  above  has  ﬁve  unknowns.  To  ﬁnd  the  equilibrium, 
several  conditions  should  be  satisﬁed: 

+ 2; 

∗ 
•  (xA , y A )  maximize  A’s  utility  sub ject  to  the  budget  constraint,  then  we 
∗
obtain  two  equations; 

∗ 
•  (xB , y B )  maximize  B’s  utility  sub ject  to  the  budget  constraint,  likewise 
∗
we  can  obtain  another  two  equations; 

∗ 
•  the  quantity  is  conserved,  or  x 
=  x  and  x 
=  y  (actually one 
+ y 
+ y
∗
∗
∗
A 
B 
A 
B 
of  these  equations is  redundant because it is  automatically  satisﬁed given 
the  preceding  four  and  another  from  these  two  equations). 

Finally,  we  obtain  ﬁve  equations.  Therefore,  the  problem  can  be  solved  (see 
Figure 3).  Assume that  yA + yB  > Y  and  xA + xB  < X ; it is not at equilibrium, 
because  Px  > P ∗ 
x ,  so  price  of  X  will  decrease.  At  equilibrium,  we  must  have 
the  right  price  ratio.  For  example,  if  the  price  for  X  is  Px ,  Px  > P ∗ 
x ,  then 
yA + yB  > y  and  xA + xB  < x.  Y  has  excess  demand,  and  X  has  excess  supply. 

4  Utility  Possibilities  Frontier 

Utility  possibilities  frontier  shows  the  utility  levels  when  the  two  individuals 
have  reached  the  contract  curve  (see  Figure  4).  Choosing  a  point  below  the 
frontier,  for  example,  A, the  allocation is ineﬃcient;  choosing  a point  above the 
frontier,  for  example,  B ,  the  allocation  is  unobtainable. 

5  Production  in  Edgeworth  Box 

Now we discuss the producer’s problem. There are two industries.  One produces 
food  and  the  other  produces  clothing.  The  isoquant  curves  are  shown  in  the 
Edgeworth box (see Figure 5). E  is their initial endowment of inputs. An

allocation  of  inputs  is  technically  eﬃcient  if  the  output  of  one  good  cannot  be 
increased  without  decreasing  the  output  of  another,  so 

M RT SF  =  M RT SC . 

At  competitive  equilibrium  in  the  input  market, 

•  wage  and  rent  are  equal  for  all  industries; 

•  total  L  and  K  in  all  industries  are  equal  to  aggregate  available  supplies. 

Similar to the consumers’ problem, the general equilibrium can be characterized 
by 

(w, r, (LF , KF ), (LC , KC )). 

Production  possibilities  frontier  shows  various  combinations  of  two  goods  that 
can  be  produced  with  ﬁxed  quantity  of  input  demanded  from  production  con­
tract  curve.
