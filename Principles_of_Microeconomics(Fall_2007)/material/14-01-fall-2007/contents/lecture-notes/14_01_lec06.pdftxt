1  Corner  Solution  of  Optimization 

When  we  have  an  interior  solution, 

Px 
Py 

= 

Ux 
Uy 

must  be  satisﬁed.  However,  sometimes  a  consumer  gets  highest  utility  level 
when  x = 0  or  y = 0.  If  that’s  the  case,  we  have  corner  solutions,  and 

Px 
Ux 
= 
,
Py  � Uy 

as  shown  in  Figure  1. 
In  Figure  1,  because  people  cannot  consume  negative  amounts  of  goods 
(bundle  A),  their  best  choice  is  to  consume  bundle  B,  so  the  quantity  of  y 
consumed  is  zero.  Conditions  for  corner  solutions: 

• 

• 

M RS = 

Ux 
Uy 

> 

Px
Py 

when y = 0. 

M RS = 

Ux 
Uy 

< 

Px
Py 

when x = 0. 

Example  (An  example  of consumer’s problem).  The  parameters  are 

Px  = 1, 

Py  = 1,

The  utility  function  is 

The  budget  constraint  is 

I  = 2. 

U (x, y ) =  x + 2√y . 

x +  y = 2. 

According  to  the  condition  for  an  interior  solution: 

Px 
Py 

= 

Ux 
.

y = 1  =  x = 1.

Py  = 1,

= ⇒ 

If the price  y  changes to 1: 

then  the  solution  is 

y = 4  =  x =  −3  < 0,
⇒

which is impossible. 
Then  we  have  the  corner  solution: 

x = 0, y = 2. 

x = 0  since  consumer  wants  to  consume  as  little  as  possible. 

2  Revealed  Preference 

In  the  former  chapters,  we  discussed  how  to  decide  optimal  consumption  from 
utility  function  and  budget  constraint: 

Utility  Function 

Budget  Constraint 

=  Optimal  Consumption 
⇒

And  now we discuss how to know consumer’s preference from budget constraint 
and  consumption: 

Budget  Constraint 

=  Preference 
⇒

Consumption

Figure  2:  A  Contradiction  of  Preference.  A  and  B  are  the  Choices. 

Example  (Revealed preference).  In  Figure  2,  two  budget  constraint  lines  inter­
sect.  Assume  one  person’s  choices  are  A  and  B  respectively.  Then  we  have 

A � C,


B � D.


And  Figure  2  obviously  shows  that 

C  ≻ B ,

D ≻ A.


Thus, 

A � C  ≻ B � D ≻ A, 
which  is  a  contradiction,  which  means  utility  does  not  optimized  and  the  choice 
is  not  rational. 

3  Deriving  Individual  Demand,  Engle  Curve 

Use  the  following  utility  function  again: 
U (x, y ) =  x + 2√y , 

with  a  budget  constraint: 

Pxx +  Py y =  I .

that  I ,  x  and  Px  are  held  constant.)

•	 Engle Curve describes the relation between quantity  and income.  Figure 
4  shows  the  relation  between  x  and  income,  and  Figure  5  shows  that 
between  y  and income. 

Normal  good.  Quantity demanded  of  good  increases  with  income. 
Inferior  good.  Quantity demanded  of  good  decreases  with  income. 

Substitutes.  Increase  in  price  of  one  leads  to  an  increase  in  quantity 
demanded  of  the  other. 
Complements.  Increase  in  price  of  one  leads  to  an  decrease  in  quantity 
demanded  of  the  other. 

For this problem, 

P 2 
•	 if  I <  P ,  x  and  y  are  neither  substitutes  nor  complements,  and  x  is  a

normal good.
