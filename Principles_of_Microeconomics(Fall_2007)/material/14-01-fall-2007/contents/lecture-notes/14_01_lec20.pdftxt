1  Production  Possibilities  Frontier 

Marginal  rate  of  transformation (M RT ): 

•	 How  much  clothing  must  be  given  up  to  produce  one  additional  unit  of 
food. 

•	 The  absolute  value  of  the  slope  of  the  production  possibilities  frontier. 

•	 If  M RT  increases  in  food,  then  the  production  possibilities  frontier  is 
concave. 

• 

M RT  = 

M CF
M CC 

. 

Proof.  Reducing  $1  input  from  clothing,  C  decreases by 
1 
input to food,  F  increases by 
.  Thus, 
M CF

M CC 

;  adding  $1

2  Output  Market  Eﬃciency 

Suppose  we  have  two  industries,  clothing  and  food,  in  the  market.  Consumers 
have demand for the two goods.  They  have  a  representative  utility  U (C, F ).  A 
Pareto eﬃcient result  occurs when the production possibilities frontier is tangent 
to the indiﬀerence  curve (see Figure 3).  That is to  say, 

M RT  =  M RS.

2.1  General  equilibrium  in  the  output  market 

4 

The  prices  are  PF  for  food,  and  PC  for  clothing.  When  the  market  reaches 
its  equilibrium,  industries  are  maximizing  their  proﬁts,  so 

Thus, 

M CF (q) =  PF ; 
M CC (q) =  PC . 

M RT  =

M CF 
M CC 

= 

PF
PC 

. 

Consumers  maximize  their  utility,  so 

M RS = 

PF
PC 

. 

Combining  the  equations together,  we  obtain (see Figure 4) 

M RT  =

=  M RS.

Given the prices, food has  a  shortage and  clothing  has  an  excess (see Figure 5).

The  prices  will  change  to  adjust  to  the  equilibrium  state,  namely,  PF  increases

and  PC  decreases.

2.1  General  equilibrium  in  the  output  market 

Example  (Gains from Free Trade).  Assume that Holland and Italy both produce 
cheese  and  wine,  unit  of  labor  required  is  provided  in  Table  2.1). 
If  these

two  countries  cannot  trade  cheese  or  wine,  we  consider  the  domestic  markets 
separately.  The  price  ratio  is  not  the  same:

C
Consumer utility levels are  UH  and  UI , respectively.  However, if  they  can trade,

Holland  exports  cheese  and  imports  wine,  and  Italy  exports  wine  and  imports

cheese.  The  prices  ratio  will  adjust  to  agree,  and  people  in  both  countries  are

better oﬀ because both indiﬀerence curves move upwards (see Figure 6).  The

′

new  utility  levels  are  UH  and  UI .
