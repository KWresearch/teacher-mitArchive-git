1  Two-Part  Tariﬀ 

When there are two consumers.  Consumer 1 has higher demand  than consumer 
2.  If  setting  P  =  M C , consumer 1  consumes  Q1  units and  consumer 2  consumer 
Q2  units.  A1  is consumer 1’s consumer surplus, and A2  is consumer 2’s consumer 
surplus.  Assume  that  2A2  > A1 .  Then  the  maximum  entry  fee  the  ﬁrm  can 
charge is  A2 .  If  more  than  A2  is  charged,  consumer  2  would  not  consume.

Summary:  the  ﬁrm  should  set 

•  usage fee 

π <  2A2 .


P  >  M C, 

namely,  larger  than  the  marginal  cost; 

•	 entry  fee


T  =  A2 ,


namely,  equal  to  the  remaining  consumer  surplus  of  the  consumer  with 
the  smaller  demand. 

Summary:  If  the  demands  of  two  consumers  are  more  similar,  the  ﬁrm  should 
set  usage fee close to  M C  and higher entry fee; if  the demands of  two consumers 
are  less  similar,  the  ﬁrm  should  set  higher  usage  fee  and  lower  entry  fee.

2  Bundling 

Bundling  means  packaging  two  or  more  products,  for  example,  vacation  travel

usually  has  a  packaging  of  hotel,  airfare,  car  rental,  etc.

Assume  there  are  two  goods  and  many  consumers  in  the  market,  and  the  con­

sumers have diﬀerent  reservation prices (willingness to pay).

See Figure 4  and 5.  The  coordinates are the  reservation prices  of  the two goods

respectively.

If  the  ﬁrm  sells  the  goods  separately  with  prices  P1  and  P2  (see Figure 4),


•  when 

and 

r1  > P1 , 

r2  > P2 , 

the  consumer  will  buy  both  good  1  and  2; 

•  when 

but 

r1  > P1 , 

r2  < P2 , 

the  consumer  will  only  buy  good  1; 

•  when 

but 

r2  > P2 , 

r1  < P1 , 

the  consumer  will  only  buy  good  2; 

•	 when


and


r1  < P  <  1,


r2  < P  <  2,


the  consumer  will  buy  neither  good  1  nor  2. 

If the  ﬁrm sells the two goods in a bundle and  charges price  PB , 

•	 if


r1  +  r2  > PB ,


the  consumer  will  buy  the  bundle; 

•	 if


the  consumer  will  not  buy  the  bundle. 

r1  +  r2  < PB ,

Bundling  Example  1:  the  four  points  in  Figure  6  represent  the  four  con­
sumers’  reservation values.  Consider two pricing  strategies  – one is that the two 
goods  are  sold  separately  with  prices  P1  =  3  and  P2  =  3,  and  the  other  is  that 
the  two  goods  are  sold  in  a  bundle  with  price  PB  = 6.  Without  bundling,  the 
revenue is 

and  with  bundling,  the  revenue  is 

R  = 12, 

R  = 12; 

bundling  does  not  do  better. 
Bundling  Example  2:  Consider  the  other  four  consumers  shown  in  Figure  7 
and the  ﬁrm chooses between the two pricing  strategies mentioned before.  With­
out  bundling,  the  revenue  is 

and  with  bundling,  the  revenue  is 

R  = 12, 

R  = 24; 

obviously,  bundling  strategy  beneﬁts  the  producer  in  this  case 
Conclusion:  bundling  works  well  when 
•  the  consumers  are  heterogeneous; 

•  price  discrimination  is  not  possible; 

•  the  demand  for  diﬀerent  goods  are  negatively  correlated.

3  Monopolistic  Competition 

In  monopolistic  competition, 

•	 there  are  many  ﬁrms; 

•	 there  is  free  entry  and  exit; 

•  products  are  diﬀerentiated  but  close  substitutes. 

Thus 

•	 each  ﬁrm  faces  a  distinct  demand,  which  is  downward  sloping  and  elastic; 

•	 there is  no proﬁt in long  run (see Figure 8  and 9); 

•	 price  is  higher  than  marginal  cost  because  ﬁrms  have  some  monopoly 
power,  and  thus  there  is  some  deadweight  loss.
