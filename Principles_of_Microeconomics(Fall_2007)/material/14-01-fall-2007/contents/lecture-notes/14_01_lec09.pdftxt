1	 Preference Toward Risk  - Risk Averse /  Neu­
tral /  Seeking (Loving) 

Three  diﬀerent  kinds  of  behaviors: 

Risk Averse (Figure 1) 
•  Facing  two payoﬀs with  the same expected  value, prefer the less risky  one. 
•  Diminishing  marginal  utility  of  income. 
•	 Relation  between  the  utility  of  expected  value  and  expected  utility 
u(E (x)) > E (u(x)). 

Example. 

u(x) = ln x. 

Risk Neutral (Figure 2) 
•  Facing  two  payoﬀs  with  the  same  expected  value,  feel  indiﬀerent. 
•  Linear  marginal  utility  of  income. 
•	 Relation  between  the  utility  of  expected  value  and  expected  utility 
u(E (x)) =  E (u(x)).

Example. 

u(x) =  x. 

Risk Seeking (Figure 3) 
•  Facing  two  payoﬀs  with  the  same  expected  value,  prefer  the  riskier  one. 
•  Increasing  marginal  utility  of  income. 
•  Relation  between  the  utility  of  expected  value  and  expected  utility 
u(E (x)) < E (u(x)). 

Example. 

u(x) =  x 2 . 

2  Risk  Premium 

Risk premium.  The  maximum  amount  of  money  that  a  risk-averse  person 
would  pay  to  avoid  taking  a  risk. 

Example  (Job Choice).  Assume that  a  risk-averse person whose utility  function 
corresponds  with  the  curve  in  Figure  4  has  two  possible  incomes.

Figure  4:  Risk  Premium:  A  Utility  Function. 

•	 His income  I  might be 10  with probability 0.5  and 30  with probability 0.5. 
Then  the  expected  value  of  income  I  is: 

E (1) = 10

0.5 + 30

×

×

0.5  = 20,

with  an  expected  utility: 

E (u(I )) =  u(10)

0.5 + u(30)

0.5  = 10

•  If  we  oﬀer  him  a  ﬁxed  income  I  ,  I  = 16,  then  his  expected  utility  is: 
E (u(I  ′ )) =  u(16) × 1  = 14 × 1  = 14. 

×

0.5 + 18

0.5  = 14.

×

One  can  see  that 

′ 
E (u(I )) =  E (u(I  )). 
′
However,  E (I ) − E (I  ) = 4.  This means the person is willing  to give up  a value 
of  4  in  exchange  for  a  riskless  income.  Thus,  the  risk  premium  is 

′ 
Risk P remium  =  E (I ) − E (I  ) = 20 − 16  = 4.

Indiﬀerence  Curve  between  Expected  Value 
and Standard Deviation 

The indiﬀerence curve we discussed before is about the quantities of two diﬀerent 
goods, now we consider the indiﬀerence curve about expected  value and  standard 
deviation (Figure 5).

Job  2 

Table  1:  The  Income  and  Probability  of  Two  Jobs. 

Example  (Job choice).  Suppose  one  has  the  following  utility  function 
u(x) =  √x 

and  two job  choices (see Table 1).  Calculate  expected  utilities: 
√1600 = 35, 
√900 + 0.5 ×
E (u(x1 )) = 0.5 ×
√625 + 0.5 ×
√2025 = 35. 
E (u(x2 )) = 0.5 ×
Thus, these two jobs give the person the same utility level, i.e.  they  are on a 
same  indiﬀerence  curve. 
In  order  to  plot  the  indiﬀerence  curve,  we  should  calculate  their  expected 
values  and  standard  deviations. 

E (x1 ) = 1250 

σ(x1 ) = 494 

E (x2 ) = 1325 

σ(x2 ) = 990 

Job  2  has  higher  expected  value  of  income  but  it  is  riskier.  (Figure  5) 
Compare  Figure  6  and  Figure  7.  The  former  is  more  risk  averse  since  one 
must  compensate  more  for  more  risk.

4  Reducing  Risk:  Diversiﬁcation

4  Reducing  Risk:  Diversiﬁcation 

Diversiﬁcation.  Reducing  risk  by  allocating  resources  to  diﬀerent  activities 
whose  outcomes  are  not  closely  related. 

Example  (Selling  air  conditioner  and  heater).  Suppose  that  the  weather 
has  a  probability  0.5  to  be  hot  and  0.5  to  be  cold.  Table  2  shows  the 
company’s proﬁt if  all its  eﬀorts in  selling  air  conditioners (heaters)  and 
the  weather turns  out to be hot (cold). 

Weather 
Air  Conditioner 
Heater

30,000 
12,000 

Cold

12,000

30,000


Table  2:  Diversiﬁcation:  Selling  Air  Conditioners  and  Heaters. 

•	 If  one  only  sells  air  conditioners  or  heaters, 
E (prof it) = 21,  000, 

σ(prof it) = 9,  000. 

•	 If  the  company  puts  half  of  its  eﬀorts  in  selling  air  conditioners  and 
half  of  its  eﬀorts  in  selling  heaters,  then  the  proﬁt  is  always  21,000 
no  matter  the  weather  is  cold  or  hot. 

E (prof it) = 21,  000, 

σ(prof it) = 0. 

Thus  we  should  choose  to  sell  both  to  reduce  risk.


Example  (Example:  Stock  versus  mutual  fund).  Mutual  fund  may  have

the  same  return  as  stock  but  much  less  risk.


Example.  ”Don’t  put  all  your  eggs  in  one  basket.”
