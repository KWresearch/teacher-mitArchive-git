1  Proﬁt  Maximization 

For  perfect  competition  in  a  product  market,  we  make  some  assumptions: 

•  Price taking:  either individual  ﬁrms or consumers cannot aﬀect the price. 

•  Product  homogeneity:  product  of  all  ﬁrms  are  perfect  substitutes. 

•  Free  entry  and  exit:  no  special  cost  to  enter  or  exit  the  market. 

Firms  choose  the  level  of  output  to  maximize  their  proﬁts.  Proﬁt  equals 
total  revenue  minus  total  cost,  namely 

π(q) =  R(q) − C (q) =  P (q)q − C (q). 

To  maximize  the  proﬁt,  the  following  condition  must  hold: 

dπ(q) 
dq 

= 

dR 
dq 

− 

dC 
dq 

=  M R(q) − M C (q) = 0,

and  thus 

Since 

we  have 

and 

M R(q) =  M C (q). 

R(q) =  P q , 

M R(q) = 

dR(q) 
dq 

=  P, 

M R  =  AR,

thus 

M C (q) =  P  =  M R  =  AR 

is  the  maximization  condition.  Note  that  the  condition  is  not  suﬃcient. 
In 
Figure  1),  if  the  price  is  P2 ,  q2  and  q3  both  satisfy  the  condition,  but  only  q3 
maximizes the proﬁt.

2  Short  Run  Supply 

Assume  the  ﬁrm  has  production  costs  shown  in  Figure  2,  let  us  discuss  its 
behavior  under  diﬀerent  prices. 

•	 When  P  =  P1 ,  the  ﬁrm  is  making  proﬁts,  so  it  will  continue  to  produce; 

•	 When  P  =  P2 , the  ﬁrm has losses but  still  continues to produce, because if 
it  shuts  down,  the  proﬁt  is  −F C ,  and  if  continuing  to  produce,  the  proﬁt 
is  R − T V C  − F C >  −F C . 

•	 Since  R < S V C ,  when  P  =  P3 , the proﬁt if  the  ﬁrm shuts down,  −F C , is 
more than the proﬁt if it  continues,  R − T V C − F C ,  so  it  will  shut  down. 

When the  ﬁrm produces, it chooses the output level  where  M C (q) =  P .  There­
fore,  the  ﬁrm’s  supply  curve  when  it  produces  is  just  the  part  of  M C  above 
T V C .  When  P  < AV C ,  the  ﬁrm  shuts  down  and  q  = 0. 
We can derive market supply from an individual  ﬁrm’s supply (see Figure 3). 
Deﬁne  elasticity  of  market  supply  as  follows: 

ES  = 

dQ/Q 
dP /P 

. 

Figure  4  and  5  stand  for  inelastic  and  elastic  supply  curves,  respectively.

3  Producer  Surplus

Similarly, we have perfectly inelastic market  supply (see Figure 6)   and perfectly 
elastic  market  supply (see Figure 7). 
Perfectly   elastic  market  supply  happens  when 

M C  = const. 

3  Producer  Surplus  

Producer  Surplus  is  the  diﬀerence  between   the  ﬁrm’s  revenue  and   the  sum  of 
the  total  variable  cost  of  producing  q  (see Figure 8): 

P S  =  R − T V C   =  R − T V C  − F C  +  F C  =  P rof it +  F C. 

Thus,  producer  surplus  is  the  sum   of  proﬁt   and  ﬁxed   cost.
