1  Monopoly 

The monopolist is the single supply-side of  the market  and has complete control 
over the amount  oﬀered for sale;  the monopolist  controls price but must  operate 
along  consumer  demand. 

1.1  Revenue  in  Monopoly 

Review  the  revenue  in  perfect  competition: 

Revenue  of  monopolist  is  also 

R  =  P Q 

AR  =  M R  =  P. 

R  =  P (Q)Q, 

(1.1) 

(1.2) 

but  P  changes  with  Q  because  the  monopolist  faces  the  whole  market  demand 
and his quantity  supplied  aﬀects the  market price.  Then the  average revenue is 

AR  =

R 

Q 

=  P (Q); 

and  the  marginal  revenue  is 

M R  =

dR 
dQ 

= 

d(P Q) 
dQ 

dP 
=  P (Q) + Q . 
dQ 

The relation between P  and  Q is determined by the demand curve (see Figure 1). 
Since 

dP 
dQ 

<  0, 

M R  < P (Q).

Example  (A Demand Function).  Suppose the price is 

P  = 10 − QD , 

where  QD  is  the  quantity  demanded.  Calculate  the  average  revenue  and  the 
marginal  revenue: 

AR  =  P  = 10 − Q; 
dP 
dQ 

M R  =  p +  Q 

= 10 − 2Q.

1.2  Output  Decision  in  Monopoly 

The  monopolist  will  maximize  its  proﬁt 

π(Q) =  R(Q) − C (Q), 

which  is  the  diﬀerence  of  revenue  and  cost.  When  maximized, 

namely, 

dπ 
dQ 

= 

dR 
dQ 

− 

dC 
dQ 

= 0, 

M R  =  M C, 

so  the  monopolist  would  choose  this  point  to  produce;  because 

P  > M R,

•	 In  a  competitive  market,


and  the  makeup  is  zero. 

•  In  a  monopolistic  market, 

M C  =  P,


M C < P, 

and  the  makeup  is  larger  than  zero. 

Comments: 

1.  The  makeup  increases  with  the  inverse  of  demand  elasticity. 

2.  The larger the demand elasticity, the less proﬁtable it is to be a monopolist 
(see  Figure  3 and  4). 

3.  A monopolist  never produces a quantity  at the inelastic portion of demand 
curve,  since  the  makeup  right  hand  side  of  Equation  1.3  is  less  than  one.

2.1	 Supply  Curve  of  Competitive  Market  and  Monopolis­
tic Markets 

The supply  curve in  competitive  markets is determined by  M C ,  and  there  is  no 
supply  curve  for  monopolistic  markets. 

2.2	 Shift  in  Demand 

In  competitive  markets,  when demand  shifts, the  changes in price  and quantity 
has  a  positive  relation,  namely,  if  the  price  raises,  the  quantity  increases.  In 
monopolistic  markets,  when  the  demand  shifts,  it  may  be  the  case  that  only 
price  changes  (see  Figure  5),  only  quantity  changes  (see  Figure  6),  or  both 
change. 

2.3	 Eﬀect  of  Tax 

In competitive marketes, buyer’s prices raise less than the tax, and the burden is 
shared  by  Producers  and  Consumers;  in  monopolistic  markets,  the  price  might 
raise  more than tax (see Figure 7).
