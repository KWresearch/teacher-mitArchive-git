Irish  Potato  Famine 

Typical  Giﬀen  good.  In  Year  1845-1849,  people  consumed  more  potatoes 
when  the  price  increased.  (Figure  1) 

2  Network  Externalities 

Network  externality.  One person’s demand depends on the demands of other 
people. 

•	 [Bandwagon eﬀect (Figure  2)]  Positive network  externality.  When 
more  people  buy,  you  will  buy  more.

Example.  iPod:  buy  to  be  in  style.


–  Market  demand  more  elastic  than  real  demand  curve. 
–  Seller  sets  lower  price. 
Example.  Operating  system:  more  software  available. 
Example.  Internet telephone. 
•	 [Snob eﬀect (Figure  3)]  Negative network  externality.  When others 
buy,  you  will  not  buy. 

–  Market  demand  more  inelastic  than  real  demand  curve. 
–  Seller  sets  Higher  price. 
Example.  Designer  clothes:  want  to  be  special.

3  Uncertainty 

An Outline in Uncertainty 

•	 Preference, Decision 
•	 Expected Value /  Variability, Risk Standard Deviation 
•	 Expected Utility 

To  measure  risk  we  must  know: 

•	 All  of  the  possible  outcomes. 
•	 The probability  that  each  outcome  will  occur, the  sum  of  the proba­
bilities  that  each  outcome  will  occur  =  1. 
Example.  Probability  of  Weather 

•	 Sunny  70%. 
•	 Rainy  5%. 
•	 Cloudy  25%. 

The  sum  of  all  the  probabilities  is  100%. 

Ob jective probability.  Based  on  observed  frequency  of  past  events.

Sub jective probability.  Based  on  perception,  theory  and  understanding  of 
outcomes. 

Measures  to  characterize  payoﬀs  and  degree  of  risk. 

Example  (Job). 
Outcome  1 
$2000  with  probability  50% 
$1510  with  probability  99% 

Outcome  2 
$1000  with  probability  50% 
$510  with  probability  1% 

Job  1 
Job  2 

Table  1:  Compare  Two  Jobs,  Each  has  Two  Outcomes 

Expected  value. 

E (x) =  p1x1  +  p2x2  +  ...  +  pnxn , 

where  x  is  a  random  variable,  which  has  realizations  x1 , x2 , ..., xn  with 
probability  p1 , p2 , ..., pn  respectively.  Discuss  the  example.  Expected  val­
ues  of  salary  from job 1  and 2  are: 

E (j ob1)  = 0.50 × 2000 + 0.50 × 1000 = 1500. 

E (j ob2)  = 0.99 × 1510 + 0.01 × 510  = 1500. 

Since 

E (j ob1)  =  E (j ob2), 

we do  not know  which job is better. 

Standard deviation. 
 
�
p1 [x1  − E (x)]2  +  p2 [x2  − E (x)]2  +  ...  +  pn [xn  − E (x)]2 . 

σ(x) = 

We  can  consider the  risks  of  those jobs from  standard deviation: 
 
�
σ1  = 0.50 × (2000 − 1500)2 + 0.50 × (1000 − 1500)2  = 500, 
 
�
σ2  = 0.99 × (1510 − 1500)2 + 0.01 × (510 − 1500)2  = 99.5. 

Since 

for less  risk,  we  will  choose job 2. 

σ1  > σ2 , 

Expected  utility. 

E [u(x)] =  p1u(x1 ) + p2u(x2 ) + ...  +  pnu(xn ).
