1  Eﬃcient  Wage  Theory 

Use  the  eﬃcient  wage  theory  to  explain  the  presence  of  unemployment. 
Suppose  the  wage  is  w,  and  workers  can  choose to  work  or  shirk provided  a 
beneﬁt  of  S .  The  unemployment  rate  is  u, and  the workers get caught  and  ﬁred 
with  a  probability  p.  If  a  worker  shirks,  he  can  get 

S + (1  − p)w +  p(1 − u)w =  S +  w(1 − pu), 

if  a  worker  does  not  shirk,  he  gets  w. 
Therefore,  a  worker  will  work  if 

that is, 

w � S +  w(1 − pu), 

w � 

S 
. 
pu 

This  is  called  nonshirking  constraint. 
Without  information  asymmetry,  the  market  wage  is  wC ,  and  full  employ­
ment  exists  at  LC .  With  information  asymmetry,  the  nonshirking  constraint 
and  the  demand  of  labor  determine  the  wage  w ∗  and labor  L∗  (see Figure 1). 
With  greater  asymmetric  information,  the  probability  that  shirking  is  de­
tected,  P  decreases,  and  thus  the  nonshirking  constraint  rises.  The  wage  and 
′ 
labor  are  w  and  L ′  respectively (see Figure 1).

2  Externalities 

Externalities  are  the  eﬀects  of  production  and  consumption  activities  not  di­
rectly  reﬂected  in  the  market. 
They  can  be  negative  or  positive. 

Negative Externalities.  Action by one party imposes a cost  on another party. 

Example  (Pollution).  Pollution  is  not  reﬂected  in  market  because  at  mar­
ket,  residents  do  not  demand  ﬁrm  pay  for  that  cost. 

Positive Externalities.  Action  by  one  party  beneﬁts  another  party. 

Example  (Beautiful Garden).  If your neighbor has a beautiful garden, you 
are  happier,  but  you  do  not  pay  your  neighbor.

Negative Externality 

An  example  is  steel  plant  dumping  waste  in  the  river  as  it  makes  steel. 
That imposes cost on  ﬁsherman downstream. Marginal  external  cost (M EC ) 
is  the  increase  in  this  cost  for  each  additional  unit  of  steel  production. 
Marginal  social  cost (M SC ) is  M C  plus  M EC . 
Given the market price P , a  ﬁrm chooses to produce  q1 , but if taking  external 
cost  into  account,  a  ﬁrm  should  produce  at  q ∗  (see Figure 2).

Figure  2:  A  Firm  with  Negative  Externality. 

In  a  competitive  market,  the  equilibrium  price  and  quantity  are  P1  and  q1 , 
but  the  eﬃcient  outcome  should  be  P ∗  and  q ∗  (see  Figure  3).  The  failure  to 
incorporate  external  cost  creates  deadweight  loss. 

Positive Externality 

Landscaping generates  external beneﬁts to the  neighbors. 
Like  the  example  above,  the  marginal  social  beneﬁt  (M SB )  is  the  sum  of 
private beneﬁt (which is the demand) and the marginal  external beneﬁt (M EB ). 
The quantity  q1  consumed  in  the  market  is  less  than  the  eﬃcient  level  q ∗  (see 
Figure 4). 

Solution  to  Externality 

Here  are  some  solutions  with  government  intervenes.

3 Property Rights

•  Tax  each  unit  produced  by  M EC .  The  marginal  cost  of  the  ﬁrm  is 

M C +  T  =  M C +  M EC  =  M SC,


then  the  ﬁrm  will  choose  eﬃcient  output.


•	 Create  a  standard  and  monitor pollution.  Control  the quantity produced 
or  pollution  emission. 

3  Property  Rights 

When  property  rights  are  well-speciﬁed,  economic  eﬃciency  may  be  achieved 
without government intervention. 

•	 Factory  can  install  a  ﬁlter. 

•	 Fishermen can pay for a treatment plant to intercept  and  clean up factory 
waste.

Table  1:  Proﬁts  Under  Alternative  Emissions  Choices. 

In  this  case  (see  Table  1),  the  most  eﬃcient  result  is  that  factory  installs 
ﬁlter  and  ﬁshermen  do  not  pay  for  treatment. 

•	 If  ﬁshermen  own  the  river,  they  can  sue  the  plant  for  damages  $400.  The 
factory  has  two  options. 

–	 The  factory  do  not  install  the  ﬁlter  and  pay  damages.  Proﬁt 

500 − 400 = 100. 

–  The  factory  install  ﬁlter.  Proﬁt  is  300.


Thus  the  factory  will  install  the  ﬁlter.


•	 If  factory  owns  the  river,  ﬁshermen  have  three  options. 

–	 Fishermen  put  in  treatment  plant.  Proﬁt  is  200. 

–	 Fishermen  pay  the  cost  of  ﬁlter  installation  to  the  factory.  Proﬁt 

500 − 200 = 300.

4 Common Property Resources

–  No  plant,  no  ﬁlter.  Proﬁt  is  100. 

A payment  to  the  factory  by  the  ﬁsherman  results  in  an  eﬃcient  outcome 
and  is  in  their  own  interest. 

Theorem  (Coase Theorem).  When parties can bargain without cost  and  to their 
mutual  advantage,  the  outcome  wil l  be  eﬃcient,  regard less  of  how  the  property 
rights  are  speciﬁed. 

4  Common  Property  Resources 

Everyone  has  free  access  to  a  renewable  resource,  for  example,  lake,  forest,  and 
so  on. 
Without  control,  the  quantity  consumed  is  q1  where  private  cost  is  equal  to 
marginal beneﬁt (demand).  However, the  eﬃcient level  of quantity  is  q ∗  where 
M SC  =  M B (D) (see Figure 5).

Some  measures  to  prevent  from  consuming  too  much: 

•  Government  puts  restrictions  on  production  quantity. 

•  Set  private  ownership  and  the  owner  sets  fees  for  use  of  resources.
