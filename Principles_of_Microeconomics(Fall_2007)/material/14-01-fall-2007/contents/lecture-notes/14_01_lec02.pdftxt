1  Demand  and  Supply  Curves 

Quantity  Demanded  and  Quantity  Supplied 

QD  (Quantity  demanded).  Depends  on  price. 

QD  =  D(P ). 

QS  (Quantity  supplied).  Depends  on  price. 

QS  =  D(P ). 

(1.1) 

(1.2) 

Notes: 

1.  Market demand/supply is the sum of individual demands/supplies. 

2.  Assume  individuals  are  price  takers  who  cannot  aﬀect  price. 

Demand  and  Supply  Curves 

From  Equations  (1.1)  and  (1.2),  draw  demand  curves  and  supply  curves  as 
follows:

Supply  curve 

See  Figure  1  and  Figure  3: 

1.  Change  in  price  causes  change  in  quantity  supplied,  on  the  graph,  there 
is  movement  along  the  curve  accordingly. 

2.  Change  in  something  other  than  price  causes  change  in  supply,  on  the 
graph,  the  supply  curve  shifts. 
Example.  Production  cost  falls  →  supply  curve  S  shifts  to  S’  (See  Fig­
ure  3). 

Demand  curve 

See  Figure  2  and  Figure  4: 

1.  Change in price  causes  change in quantity  demanded,  on the graph, there 
is  movement  along  the  curve  accordingly. 

2.  Change  in  something  other  than  price  causes  change  in  demand,  on  the 
graph,  the  demand  curve  shifts. 
Example.  People’s  income  increases  →  demand  curve D  shifts to D’  (Fig­
ure  4). 

Substitutes  and  Complements 

Substitutes.  Increase  in  the  price  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  demand  of  the 
other. 
Example  (Italian  and  French  bread).  Price  of  Italian  bread  increases,  de­
mand  of  French  bread  increases. 

Complements.  Increase  in  the  price  leads  to  a  decrease  in  the  demand  of  the 
other. 
Example  (Pasta  and  pasta  sauce).  Price  of  pasta  increases,  demand  of 
pasta  sauce  decreases. 

2  Equilibrium  in  the  Market 

Equilibrium  state: 

•  No  shortage 

•  No  surplus 

•  Equilibrium  price  clears  the  market.

Figure  5:  Demand  and  Supply  curves.  Equilibrium  state. 

Refer  to Figure  5.  (P0 , Q0 ) is  the  equilibrium  state,  which  is  the intersection 
point  of  the  demand  and  supply  curves.

=⇒  Change  in  equilibrium 

Demand

Quantity 

Surplus  and  Shortage 

Surplus.  Price  P1  is  higher  than  P0  and  will  fall  down. 

Shortage.  Price  P2  is  lower  than  P0  and  will  raise  up. 

Comparative  Static  Analysis  and  Comparative  Dynamics 

Comparative  static  analysis.  Compares  the  new  and  old  equilibrium  and 
not  the  actual  path  through  time  of  the  change. 

Comparative  dynamic  analysis.  Traces  out  the  path  over  time. 

This  course  will  cover  primarily  Comparative  Static  analysis.

Figure  6:  Decrease  in  raw  material  prices. 

Examples 

Example  (Decrease  in  raw  material  prices).  Raw  material  prices  �→  Supply 
�→  Price  �  and Quantity  �  (Figure  6). 
Example (Increase in income).  Income �→ Demand�→  Price  �  and Quantity 
�  (Figure  7). 

Dual  shifts  in  supply  and  demand 

When  supply  and demand  change  simultaneously,  the impact  on  the  equilibrium 
price  and  quantity  is  determined  by  the  size  and  direction  of  the  changes  and 
the  slope  of  two  curves. 

3  Government  Interventions 

How  can  government  help  sellers?  Discuss  two  methods. 

Problem  Description 

Assume  that 

QD  = 10 − P , 

QS  =  −2 + P .

Figure  7:  Increse  in  income. 

The  original  equilibrium  point  is 

P0  = 6, 

QD0  =  QS0  = 4, 

and  the  revenue  before  government  intervention  is: 

RE V EN U E  =  P0  ×  QD0  = 6 ×  4  = 24. 

The  government’s  goal:  increase  sellers’  revenue. 

Price  Floor 

The  ﬁrst method:  set a price  ﬂoor.  Assume the lowest price is set to be 8, thus: 

QD  = 2, 

QS  = 6. 

The  revenue  after  using  method  1  is: 

REVENUE  =  P  ×  QD  = 8 ×  2  = 16  < 24.

Subsidy 

The  second  method:  provide  subsidy. 
Customers  get  a  2  unit  price  refund  per  unit  quantity  bought,  thus  the 
quantity  demanded  changes: 

QD  = 10 − (P  − 2)  = 12 − P . 

The  new  intersection  point  is 

P  = 7, 

QD  =  QS  = 5. 

The  revenue  after  using  method  2  is: 

REVENUE  =  P  ×  QD  = 7 ×  5  = 35  > 24. 

For  this  example, providing  subsidies  achieves  the government’s goal  to increase 
seller’s  revenue,  but  setting  price  ﬂoor  does  not  and  even  makes  the  revenue 
less.
