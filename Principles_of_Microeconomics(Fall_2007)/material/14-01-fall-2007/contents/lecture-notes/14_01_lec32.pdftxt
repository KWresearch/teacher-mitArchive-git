1  Present  Discount  Value 

Present  discount  value  (PDV)  determines  the  value  today  of  a  future  ﬂow  of 
income.

Table  1:  Two  Payments. 

Consider  the  two  payments,  A  and  B,  in  Table  1.

Because  the  present  value  of  1  dollar  in  n  years is

(1 + r)n 
where  r  is  the  interest  rate,  the  present  values  of  A  and  B  are

•  If  r  is low,  P V  of B is larger than  P V  of A. 

•  If  r  is high,  P V  of A is larger than  P V  of B. 

Several  examples  are  provided  in  Table  2.

2  Bond 

A bond is  a  contract in  which  a borrower (issuer)  agrees to pay  the bondholder 
(the  lender) a  stream  of  money. 
For instance, a payment consists of  a coupon payment  of 100 dollars per year 
for 10 years,  and  a principal payment  of 1000 dollars in 10 years. 
P V  of  the bond is 

P V  =

100 
(1 + r)2 

+  ... +

100 
(1 + r)10 

+ 

1000 
(1 + r)10 

. 

With  a higher interest  rate, the present discount  value is lower (see Figure 1).

3  Eﬀective  Yield 

Eﬀective  yield  is  the  interest  rate  that  equates  the  present  value  of  a  bond’s 
payment  stream  with  the  bond’s  market  price. 
Riskier  bonds  have  higher  yields.  An  eﬀective  yield  equals  risk-free  interest 
rate  plus  risk  premium. 
When  we  choose  between  pro jects,  we  can  compare  the  present  value,  or 
compare  the  yield  rate,  and  choose  the  higher  one.

Table  3:  Two  Pro jects. 

Assume


r = 15%.


P V  of A is  -4, and  P V  of B is 11.  P V  of B is higher;  thus  ﬁrm should invest 
in B. 
Now  calculate  the  yield  rates. 
For pro ject A, 

50  = 

+

(1 + rA )2 
1 + rA 
rA  = 10%. 

For pro ject B, 

20  = 

+

,
(1 + rB )2 
1 + rB 
rB  = 20%. 

Here  yield  rate  of  B  is  higher.  Firm  should  invest  in  B  again. 
In this case, the results of both  criteria are consistent;  however, they  are not 
always  consistent. 

4  Determine  Interest  Rate 

The  interest  rate  is  the  price  that  borrowers  pay  lenders  to  use  their  funds.  It 
is  determined  by  supply  and  demand  for  loanable  funds.  Demand  for  loanable 
funds comes from  ﬁrms and governments that  want to make capital investments. 
Supply  of loanable funds  comes from household  savings (see Figure 2). 
Suppose a consumer only lives for two periods, intertemporal utility function 
u(C1 , C2 ) will  be  maximized,  under  the  budget  constraint 

P V  =  Y1  +

Y2 
1 + r 

=  C1  +
