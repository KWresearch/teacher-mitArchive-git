1  Price  Elasticity  of  Supply 

Price  elasticity  of  supply.  The  percentage  change  in  quantity  supplied  re­
sulting  from  one  percentage  change  in  price.

In the short run, if price increases,  ﬁrms will  want to produce more but cannot 
hire  workers  and  buy  machines  immediately,  thus  the  supply  is  less  elastic.  In 
contrast,  supply  is  more  elastic  in  the  long  run. 
Example  (Example  in  Elasticities  of  Demand).  Assume the quantity  demanded 
is 

.

QD  = 14 −  3P  +  I + 2PS  −  PC . 

•  P  - Price 

•  I  - Income 

•  PS  - Price  of  substitute 

•  PC  - Price  of  complement 

D ,  EI ,  EQPS  and  EQPC  when  P  = 1,  I  = 10,  PS  = 2  and  PC  = 1. 
Calculate  EP
Solution: 
Given  the  values  of  variables,  the  quantity  demanded  is: 

QD  = 14 −  3 ×  1 + 10 + 2 ×  2 −  1  = 24.

2  Consumer  Preferences 

Consumer behavior	

�
•	 What  amount  and  types  of  goods  will  be  purchased. 

Consumer preferences 
Budget constraints 

 

�

=⇒ 

•	 Origin  of  demand,  how  to  decide  demand. 

Topics 

1.	 Preference 

2.	 Indiﬀerence Curve, Marginal Rate  of Substitution (MRS) 

3.	 Utility  Functions 

Preference 

Notation 

•	 A  ≻  B: A is preferred  to B. 

•	 A∼  B: A is indiﬀerent to B. 

Basic  assumptions  for  preferences 

•	 Completeness  - can  rank  any  basket  of  goods.

(always possible to decide preference  or indiﬀerence)


•	 Transtivity  - A≻B  and  B≻C implies A≻  C. 
This  assumption  seems  obvious, but  can have  contradiction (see  example 
below).

Table  1:  Example  of  contradiction  of  transitivity. 

Example  (A  contradiction  of  transtivity).  Chart  below  lists  3  goods  and 
3 properties,  assume that people  will prefer  one to  another if 2 properties 
are  better.  Table  1.  Actually  A  ≻  B,  B  ≻  C  and  C  ≻  A  - this  loop 
contradicts  the  assumption. 

•	 Non-satiation  - more  is  better.  (Monotonicity) Assume  we  discuss  goods, 
since  in  general,  more  is  not  always  better. 

•	 Convexity  - given  two  indiﬀerent  bundles,  always  prefer  the  average  to 
each  of them.  In Figure 1, the  average point C is  more preferred to A  or 
B. 

Figure  1:  Convexity  of  indiﬀerence  curve. 

Indiﬀerence Curve, Marginal Rate  of Substitution (MRS) 

Properties  of  indiﬀerence  curves 

•  Downward  sloping:  if  not,  non-satiation  violated.  Refer  to  Figure  1.

Figure  2:  Compare  the  Shapes  of  Indiﬀerence  Curve. 

•	 Cannot  cross: 
if  not,  non-satiation  and  transitivity  cannot  be  satisﬁed 
simultaneously.  In  Figure  1,  assume  there  is  another  indiﬀerence  curve 
through  A  and  D. 

A ∼  B , A ∼  D =⇒  B ∼  D. 

However, 

B ≻  D 

in  this  ﬁgure.  Contradiction  exists. 

•	 Shape:  describes  how  willing  one  is  to  substitute  one  good  for  another. 
See Figure 2. 

Marginal  rate  of  substitution (MRS) 

Marginal  rate  of  substitution (MRS).  How many  units of  Y  one is willing 
to  give  up  in  order  to  get  one  more  unit  of  X .

People prefer  a balanced basket  of goods.


•	 MRS decreasing. 

•	 Preferred  set  is  convex. 

•	 The  left  one  in  Figure  2  makes  more  sense  in  the  real  world. 

Perfect  substitution.  MRS  is  constant.


Perfect  complements.  Indiﬀerence  curves  are  shaped  as  right  angles.


Example  (Perfect  complements).  Buying  shoes.  People  need  both  the  left  one 
and  the  right  one.

Figure  4:  Indiﬀerence  Curve  with  Utility  Function  u(x, y ) =  xy . 

Utility Functions 

Utility function.  Assigns  a  level  of  utility  to  each  basket  of  consumption. 
Example  (A sample  utility  function). 

u(x, y ) =  xy . 

For  example, (5,5)  is indiﬀerent to (25,1)  and (1,25). 

Ordinal  utility  function.  Ranks  the  preferences,  but  does  not  indicate  how 
much  one  is  preferred  to  another. 

Cardinal  utility  function.  Describes  the  extent  to  which  one  of  the  bundles 
is  preferred  to  another.  Only  the  ordinal  utility  function  is  required  in 
this  course.
