Overview:  Themes,  Types  of  Markets,  Economic

Measurement, Economic Analysis


Microeconomics  is a branch of  economics that  studies how individuals and 
ﬁrms  make  decisions  to  allocate  limited  resources,  typically  in  markets  where 
goods  or  services  are  being  bought  and  sold.

1  Optimization  and  Allocation 

Consumer  theory.  Maximize preference (with limited income  or time) 

Producer  theory.  Maximize proﬁt (with limited  capital) 

2  Deﬁnition  and  Various  Type  of  Markets 

Market.  A  place  where  buyers  and  sellers  come  together  to  exchange  some 
product  or  good.

3 Economic Measurement 

2 

In  a  factor  market,  buyers  are  ﬁrms  who  need  to  hire  workers  and  borrow 
money  for  capital  expenditure,  and  sellers  are  individuals  who  provide  labor 
and  save  money  in  banks.

Table  2  shows  diﬀerent  markets  based  on  product  diﬀerentiation  and  inﬂu­
ence on price.  Inﬂuence on price increases in  moving from Competitive markets 
to Monopoly. 

3  Economic  Measurement 

Flow  and  Stock  Variables 

Stock  variables.  Not  measured  with  respect  to  time.  e.g.  price,  wealth,  in­
ventories. 

Flow  variables.  Measured  per  some  unit  of  time.  e.g.  production,  consump­
tion, income. 

Two  additional  ﬂow  variables: 

Expenditure. 

EXPENDITURE  = PRICE × CONSUMPTION. 

REVENUE  = PRICE × PRODUCTION. 

Revenue. 

Prices 

Nominal price.  The absolute or current dollar price of  a good  or service when 
it  is  sold. 

Real price.  The  price  relative  to  an  aggregate  measure  of  prices  or  constant 
dollar price.  It  also  measures prices  relative to  others.  Price  after  adjust­
ment for inﬂation.

4 Economic Analysis 

3 

CPI(Consumer Price Index).  Total  spending  on  a  market  basket  of 
goods. 

Formula  of  inﬂation  rate: 

(Gross) Inﬂation rate = 

CPI (current year) 
CPI (base year) 

. 

Formula  of  real  price: 

Real price  = 

Nominal price (current year) 
Inﬂation rate (base year to current year)

,

or 

Real price  = 

Nominal price (current year) 
CPI(current)/CPI(base) 

. 

Example.  For  instance,  the  average  tuition  of  college: 

Year  Nominal  Price 
2,530 
1970 
12,018 
1990 
2002 
18,273 

CPI  Real  Price  (base  year  1970) 
2,530 
38.8 
3,569 
130.7 
181.0 
3,917 

Table  3:  Average  Tuition  of  College  1970  to  2002. 

Notice  that  from  1970  to  2002  nominal price  increases  by  7  times  but  real 
price  increases by  1.5 times. 

4  Economic  Analysis 

Positive  analysis.  Study  the  relationship  of  cause  and  eﬀect (Questions that 
deal  with  explanation  and  prediction). 

Normative  analysis.  Analysis  examining questions  of  what  ought to be (Of­
ten  supplemented by  value judgments).
