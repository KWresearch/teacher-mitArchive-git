1.  Chap  18:  Public  Goods 

1  Public  Goods 

Characteristics  of  public  goods: 

Nonrival.  For  any  given  level  of  production,  the  marginal  cost  of  providing  it 
to  an  additional  consumer  is  zero:  enjoy  it  rather  than  use  it  up. 

Nonexclusive.  People cannot be excluded from consuming  the good.  Diﬃcult 
to  charge  for  its  enjoyment. 

Example  (Roads). 
Example  (Streetlight).  Once  streetlight  is  setup,  everyone  can  see  the  light 
(nonexclusive). 

It  is  more  eﬃcient  to  have  government  provide  public  goods.  Government 
provides  and  imposes  tax. 

Free-rider  problem.  Consumer  need  to  pay  for  public  goods,  and  they  tend 
to  understate  the  value. 
Example  (Streetlight).  Assume  cost  of  building  a  street  light  is  1.  A’s 
and  B’s  reservation  values  for  the  street  light  are  both  1,  but  they  are  not 
known by government.  Then government  asks A  and B  to  announce their 
value.  The  street  light  will  be  built  if 

VA  +  VB  � 1, 

and  people  who  have  value  share  the  cost.  Their  payoﬀs  are  shown  in 
Table  1).  Therefore,  A  and  B  will  both  announce  the  value  as  0.  The 
result is ineﬃcient:  consumers wait for others to pay for the public goods.
