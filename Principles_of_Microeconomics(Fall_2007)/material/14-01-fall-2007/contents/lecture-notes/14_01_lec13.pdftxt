Cost  Function 

Let  w  be  the  cost  per  unit  of  labor  and  r  be  the  cost  per  unit  of  capital.  With 
the input Labor (L) and Capital (K ),  the  production  cost  is 
w × L +  r × K. 
A  cost  function  C (q)  is  a  function  of  q ,  which  tells  us  what  the  minimum  cost 
is for producing  q  units  of  output.  We  can  also  split  total  cost  into  ﬁxed  cost 
and  variable  cost  as  follows: 

C (q) =  F C +  V C (q). 

Fixed  cost is independent  of quantity,  while variable cost is dependent  on quan­
tity. 

1  Short-Run  Cost  Function 

In  the  short-run,  ﬁrms  cannot  change  capital,  that  is  to  say, 
r × K  = const. 
Recall  the production function given  ﬁxed  capital level  K  in the short  run (refer 
to Lecture 11) (see Figure 1).  Suppose  w  =  1,  the  variable  cost  curve  can  be 
derived  from  Figure  1.  Adding  r × K  to  the  variable  cost,  we  obtain  the  total 
cost  curve (see Figure 2).  Average total  cost is 

AT C  =

F C +  V C

In Lecture 11,  we discussed the  relation between  average product  of labor  and 
marginal  product  of  labor  (see  Figure  3).  We  draw  the  curves  for  AV C  and

Now  consider  the  total  cost.  Note  that  the  diﬀerence  between  AT C  and  AV C 
decreases  with  q  as  the  average  ﬁxed  cost  term  dies  out  (see  Figure  4).  The

Figure  5:  Isoquant  Curve. 

2  Long-Run  Cost  Function 

In  the  long-run,  both  K  and  L  are  variable.  The  isoquant  curve  describes  the 
same  output  level  with  diﬀerent  combination  of  K  and  L  (see  Figure  5).  The 
slope  of  an  isoquant  curve  is 

M PL 
−M RT S =  − M PK 
Similarly, the isocost  curve is constructed by diﬀerent (K, L) with  the same cost 
(see  Figure  6).  The  isocost  curve  equation  is: 

. 

rK +  wL = const, 
w . r 
therefore,  it  is  linear,  with  a  slope  − 
Now we want to minimize the cost rK +wL sub ject to an output level  Q(K, L) = 
q .  This  minimum  cost  can  be  obtained  when  the  isocost  curve  is  tangent  to  the 
isoquant  curve (see Figure 7).  Thus the  slopes  of  these two  curves  are  equal: 

M RT S =

M PL 
M PK 

= 

w 
. 
r 

Now  consider  an increase in  wage (w).  The  slope  of  the  isocost  curve  increases 
(see  Figure  8),  and  the  ﬁrm  use  more  capital and  less  labor.  The  ﬁrm’s  choice 
of  input  moves  from  A  to  B  in  the  ﬁgure. 
The  expansion  path  shows  the  minimum  cost  combinations  of  labor  and 
capital  at  each level  of  output (see Figure 9).
