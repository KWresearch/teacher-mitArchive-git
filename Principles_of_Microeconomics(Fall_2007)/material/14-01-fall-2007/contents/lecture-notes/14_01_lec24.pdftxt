1  Monopsony 

A  monopsony  is  a  market  in  which  there  is  a  single  buyer.  Typically,  a  monop­
sonist  chooses to  maximize the total  value derived from buying  the goods minus 
the  total  expenditure  on  the  goods:  V (Q) − E (Q). 
Marginal  value is the  additional beneﬁt derived from purchasing  one  more  unit 
of  a  good;  since  the  demand  curve  shows  the  buyer’s  additional  willingness  to 
pay  for  an  additional  unit,  marginal  value  and  the  demand  curve  coincide. 
Marginal  expenditure  is  the  additional  cost  of  buying  one  more  unit  of  a 
good.  Average  expenditure  is  the  market  price  paid  for  each  unit,  which  is 
determined by  the  market supply (see Figure 1).  Now  compare the  competitive 
and  monopsony  market. 

•  Competitive buying ﬁrms are price takers: The price P ∗  is  ﬁxed;  therefore,

Figure  1:  Monopsony  Market. 

Since  the  supply  curve  is  upward  sloping, 

To  maximize 

we have 

M E > PS (Q) =  AE . 

V (Q) − E (Q), 

M V (Q) =  M E (Q). 

Buyers gain A−B  from monopsony power, while sellers lose A+C  (see Figure 1); 
the deadweight loss is  B +  C . 

2  Monopoly  Power 

There  usually  is  more  than  one  ﬁrm  in  the  market,  and  they  have  similar  but 
diﬀerent  goods.  The  Lerner’s  index  is 

L =

P  − M C 
P 

= 

1 
|Ed |

, 

in which  |Ed | is the elasticity  of demand for a  ﬁrm, as oppose to market demand

elasticity.

There  are  several  factors  that  aﬀect  monopoly  power.

Figure  2:  Competitive  Buying  Market. 

•	 Elasticity  of  Market  Demand:  If  the  market  demand  is  more  elastic,  the 
ﬁrm’s  demand  is  also  more  elastic.  In  a  competitive  market,  elasticity  of 
demand  for  a  ﬁrm  is  inﬁnite.  With  more  than  one  ﬁrm,  a  single  ﬁrm’s 
demand  is  more  elastic  than  market  demand. 

•	 Number of Firms in Market: With more  ﬁrms, the  ﬁrm’s demand  elasticity 
is  higher,  namely,  the  market  power  is  less. 

•	 Interaction  among  Firms:  If  competitors  are  more  aggressive,  ﬁrms  have 
less market power;  if  ﬁrms collude, they  thus have more market power. 

3  Price  Discrimination 

Without market power, the producer would focus on managing production;  with 
market  power,  the  producer  not  only  manages  production,  but  also  sets  price 
to  capture  consumer  surplus. 

First  Degree  Price  Discrimination 

Knowing  each  consumer’s identity  and  willingness to pay, the producer  charges 
a  separate price to  each  customer. 

• 

M R(Q) =  PD (Q).

Figure  3:  First  Degree  Price  Discrimination. 

•	 Choose  Q∗  such that


Q∗  is  eﬃcient. 

M R(Q∗) =  M C (Q∗ )


•  When  the  consumer  surplus  is  zero,  the  producer  surplus  is  maximized. 

This  kind  of  price  discrimination  is  not  usually  encountered  in  real  world. 

Second  Degree  Price  Discrimination 

The  producer  charges  diﬀerent  unit  prices  for  diﬀerent  quantity  purchased.  It 
applies to the situation when consumers are heterogeneous and  the seller cannot 
tell  their  identity,  and  consumers  have  multiple  unit  demand. 

Third  Degree  Price  Discrimination
