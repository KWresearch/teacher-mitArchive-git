1  Collusion  –  Prisoners’  Dilemma 

Last  time  we  talked  about  the  prisoners’  dilemma.  The  conclusion  is  that  they 
will  betray  the  other. 
Now  apply  it  to  the  cases  of Cournot  and  Bertrand models. 
In  the  Cournot model,  the  demand  is 

The  equilibrium  will  be 

with 

P  = 30 − Q1  − Q2 . 

Q1  = Q2  = 10, 

π1  = π2  = 100. 

However, to maximize their total proﬁts, they should choose a total quantity 
Q  so  that 

d 
(Q(30 − Q)) = 0, 
dQ 

which  follows  that 

If  they  share  proﬁt  equally, 

and 

Q = 15. 

Q1  = Q2  = 7.5, 

π1  = π2  = 112.5.

Obviously,  the  latter  case  will  make  both  of  them  better  oﬀ.  But  given  the 
opponent produces  7.5,  each of  them  can  increase  the  proﬁt by  producing more 
(see  Figure  1). 
In  Bertrand model,  demand  functions  for  ﬁrm  1  and  ﬁrm  2  are 

and 

Equilibrium  is 

with 

Q1  = 12 − 2P1  + P2 , 

Q2  = 12 − 2P2  + P1 . 

P1  = P2  = 4, 

π1  = π2  = 32. 

However, ﬁrms can choose P1  and P2  together to maximize the total revenue 

π = P1 (12 − 2P1  + P2 ) + P2 (12 − 2P2  + P1 ). 

By  ﬁrst  order  condition,  we  obtain 

and 

12 − 4P1  + 2P2  = 0, 

12 − 4P2  + 2P1  = 0.

Thus 

with 

P1  = P2  = 6, 

π1  = π2  = 36. 

But  in  this  case,  each  ﬁrm  has  incentive  to  lower  its  price  given  the  other 
ﬁrm’s  price  (see  Figure  2).

2  Repeated  Games 

Back  to  the  prisoners’  problem.  If  suspect  A  and  B  will  cooperate  for  inﬁnite 
periods,  and  they  are  both  patient,  they  care  about  future  payoﬀs.  Because  if 
one  of  them  betrays  this  time,  the  opponent  will  lose  the  trust  and  betray  in 
the  future;  the  payoﬀ  changes  from −1  to  −3  for  each  time.  Therefore,  both  A 
and  B  would  like  to  keep  silence.  But  if  they  are  impatient,  and  only  consider 
today’s  payoﬀ,  they  will  still  betray.  Now  move  on  to  the  case  that  A  and  B 
will cooperate  for ﬁnite number  times which  is  fairly  large.  We deduce  from the 
last  time  they  cooperate;  the  answer  is  that  they  will  betray  for  the  last  time, 
so  will  they  for  other  opportunities.  Therefore,  the  collusion  between  A  and  B 
succeed  only  if  they  will  be  cooperative  forever  and  are  patient.

In  order  to  get  the  largest  20  by  producing  sweet,  ﬁrm  2  tries  to  make  ﬁrm 
1  believe  that  ﬁrm  1  should  choose  crispy  by  claiming  that  it  always  produces 
sweet  no  matter  what  ﬁrm  1  produces.  However,  ﬁrm  1  can  ignore  ﬁrm  2’s 
announcement  because  once  ﬁrm  1  choose  sweet,  ﬁrm  2  will  produce  crispy. 
Suppose  that  ﬁrm  2  will  advertise  and  so  change  the  payoﬀs.

In  this  case,  ﬁrm  2  feels  indiﬀerent  between  choosing  crispy  or  sweet  when 
ﬁrm  1  produces  sweet,  and  chooses  sweet  when  ﬁrm  1  produces  crispy.  So  it  is 
credible if ﬁrm 2 claims that it always chooses sweet, and then ﬁrm 1 had better 
choose  crispy.  This  example  tells  us  that  ﬁrm  2  had  to  do  something  to  make 
the  announcement  credible.

4  Maximin  Strategy 

See  Table  3.  Firm  B  has  dominant  strategy:  advertise. 
Therefore,  the  equilibrium  should  be  both  A  and  B  advertise. 
However,  if  ﬁrm B  does not  choose  the  rational option,  the minimum  payoﬀ 
of A  is  5  if  A  advertises,  and  8  if  A  does  not  advertise. 
The  maximin  strategy  is  the  strategy  that  renders  the  highest  minimum 
payoﬀ. 
When  A  cannot  tell  whether  B  is  rational  or  not,  A  might  use  maximin 
strategy.  In  this  case,  the  maximin  strategy  of A  is: 

Firm A 

Advertise 
Not  Advertise 

Firm  B 
Advertise  Not  Advertise

5,0 
15,2
