Stackelberg  model  is  an  oligopoly  model  in  which  ﬁrms  choose  quantities  se ­
quentially. 
Now  change  the  example  discussed  in  last  lecture  as  follows:  if  ﬁrm  1  pro ­
duces  crispy and ﬁrm 2 produces  sweet,  the payoﬀ  is  (10, 20);  if ﬁrm 1  produces 
sweet  and  ﬁrm  2  produces  crispy,  the  payoﬀ  is  (20, 10)  (see  Table  1).

Start  from  the  bottom  using  backward  induction,  namely,  solve  ﬁrm  2’s 
decision  problem  ﬁrst,  and  then  ﬁrm  1’s.  If  ﬁrm  1  chooses  crispy,  ﬁrm  2  will 
choose  sweet  to  get  a  higher  payoﬀ.  If  ﬁrm  2  chooses  sweet,  ﬁrm  2  will  choose 
crispy.  Knowing  this,  ﬁrm  1  will  choose  sweet  in  the  ﬁrst  place.  In  this  case, 
going  ﬁrst  gives  ﬁrm  1  the  advantage.  Now  consider  the  case  we  discussed  for 
the Cournot model,  but ﬁrm 1  chooses Q1  ﬁrst, and ﬁrm 2  choose Q2  later.  For 
ﬁrm  2,  the  ﬁrst  order  condition 

d 
(30 − Q1  − Q2) × Q2  = 0 
dQ2 

Q2 (Q1 ) = 15 − 

Q1 
.

d 
(30 − Q1  − Q2 (Q1 ) × Q1  = 0 
dQ1 

gives  that 

For  ﬁrm  1, 

gives  that 

Thus,  the  result will  be 

Q1  = 15. 

Q1  = 15, 

π1  = 112.5; 

Q2  = 7.5, 

π2  = 56.25. 

In  this  case,  ﬁrm  1  also  has  advantage  to  go  ﬁrst. 

2  Bertrand 

The  Bertrand  model  is  the  oligopoly  model  in  which  ﬁrms  compete  in  price. 
First  assume  that  two  ﬁrms  produce  homogeneous  goods  and  choose  the  prices 
simultaneously.  Assume  two  ﬁrms  have  the  same marginal  cost 

consumers  buy  goods  from  the  ﬁrm  with  lower  price.  If 

M C1  = M C2  = 3; 

P1  = P2  = 4, 

the  two  ﬁrms  share  the  market  equally,  but  this  is  not  the  equilibrium.  The 
reason  is  that  one  ﬁrm  can  get  whole  demand  by  lowering  the  price  a  little; 
therefore,  the  equilibrium  will  be 

P1  = P2  = 3,

when  the  price  is  equal  to  the  marginal  cost.  Now  we  check  if 

is  the  best  choice  for  ﬁrm  1  given 

When 

if 

P1  = 3 

P2  = 3. 

P1  = 3, 

π1  = 0; 

P1  > 3, 

consumers will  not  buy  ﬁrm  1’s  goods,  thus 

if 

π1  = 0; 

P1  < 3, 

the  price  is  lower  than  the  marginal  cost,  thus 

It  follows  that 

π1  < 0. 

P1  = 3 

is  optimal  for  ﬁrm  1;  by  analogy,  we  can  get  the  same  conclusion  for  ﬁrm  2. 
Therefore, 

P1  = P2  = 3 = M C 

in  a  Bertrand  game  with  homogeneous  goods.  This  is  like  the  competitive 
market. 
Suppose  the  goods  from  the  two  ﬁrms  are  heterogeneous,  but  substitutes. 
Firm  1  and  ﬁrm  2  face  the  following  demands: 

and 

Q1  = 12 − 2P1  + P2 , 

Q2  = 12 − 2P2  + P1 . 

Firm  1’s  and  ﬁrm  2’s  reaction  functions  are

3  Prisoner’s  Dilemma

At  equilibrium, 

and 

so 

and 

P1  = P 1 , 

P2  = P 2 ; 

P1  = P2  = 4, 

Q1  = Q2  = 8, 

π1  = π2  = 32. 

Consider  the  case when  the  ﬁrms  choose prices  sequentially.  Supposing  ﬁrm  2’s 
ﬁrst  order  condition 

d 
(12 − P2  + P1 ) × P2  = 0 
dQ2 
and  ﬁrm  1’s  ﬁrst  order  condition 

d 
(12 − 2P1  + P2 (P1 )) × P1  = 0. 
dQ1 

From  the  ﬁrst  equation 

P1
4 
and  then  substitute  it  into  the  second  equation,  we  obtain 

P2 (P1 ) = 3 +

Therefore,

P1  = 4  .

and

In  this  case,  we  can  see  that  the  ﬁrm  who  goes  ﬁrst  has  disadvantage,  when 
competing  in  price. 

3  Prisoner’s  Dilemma 

Criminals  A  and  B  cooperated,  and  then  got  caught.  However,  the  police  have 
no  evidence;  so  they  have  to  interrogate  A  and  B  separately,  trying  to  make 
them  tell  the  truth.

Table  2:  Payoﬀs  of  Firm A  and  B. 

The  above  matrix  shows  A  and  B’s  payoﬀs.  Given  the  payoﬀs,  A  and  B 
choose  to  tell  the  truth  (betray)  or  keep  silent.  We  can  see  that,  if  they  both 
keep  silence,  the  result  (−1, −1)  is  best  for  them;  nonetheless,  if  one  of  them 
betrays another, he will be free but his companion will have payoﬀ -6; moreover, 
if  both  of  them  betray,  they  will  face  the  result  (−3, −3). 
Consider  what  A  thinks.  Whether  B  keeps  silence  or  betrays  him,  A  will 
always be better oﬀ if he betrays; so will B. Therefore, the result of this problem 
is  (−3, −3),  namely,  both  prisoners  betray.
