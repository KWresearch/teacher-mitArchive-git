1  Long  Run  Competitive  Equilibrium 

In  Figure1,  an  existing  ﬁrm’s  marginal  cost  and  average  total  cost  are  SM C 
and  SAC . The short-run market price is 7, so existing  ﬁrms are making proﬁts. 
In  the  long  run,  capital  can  be  changed;  old  ﬁrms  expand,  new  ﬁrms  enter  the 
market,  thus  the  supply  increases,  which  leads  to  price  decreasing.  The  price 
will  decrease  until  P  =  LM C  =  LAC ,  so  that  ﬁrms  have  no  economic  proﬁt. 

In  the  long  run,  ﬁrms  earn  zero  proﬁt,  and  in  the  short  run,  ﬁrms  can  have 
positive proﬁt.  However, the short run proﬁt is not  always higher because  ﬁrms 
can  also have  negative proﬁt (when  P  < AT C ).

2  Long  Run  Market  Supply 

2 

At  long  run  competitive  equilibrium: 

•	 All  ﬁrms  are  maximizing  proﬁt,  or  M R =  M C . 

•	 No  ﬁrm has incentive to enter or exit earning  zero economic proﬁt (this is 
the  diﬀerence  between  short  run  and  long  run). 

• 

QD  =  QS . 

In  Figure  2,  suppose  the  original  price  is  4.  Existing  ﬁrms  make  proﬁt,  so 
new  ﬁrms  enter  the  market  and  the  market  supply  curve  shifts  from  S1  to  S2 . 
Now  the  market  price  is  3,  existing  ﬁrms  make  no  proﬁt,  and  new  ﬁrms  stop 
entering.  Thus,  the  equilibrium  is  reached. 

In  Figure  3,  the  original  price  2  is  lower  than  AC .  Firms  have  a  loss  and 
start  leaving  the  market,  and  the  market  supply  shifts  from  S1  to  S2 .

Assume that: 

•	 All  ﬁrms  have  the  same  technology; 

•	 Initially  ﬁrms  produce  at  minimum  long  run  average  cost.

Constant-Cost  Industry 

In  constant-cost industry, price  of inputs does  not change.  If  the price is higher 
than  minimum  LAC .  new  ﬁrms  will  keep  entering,  so  the  supply  is  perfectly 
elastic  at  P  = minimumLAC .  Long  run  supply  is  a  horizontal  line  at  the  price 
equal  to  the  minimum  LAC  (see Figure 4(b)).

Price of  some or all inputs rises as production is expanded  and demand  of inputs 
increases.  When the price increase from  P ∗  to  P ′  ,  ﬁrms  are  making proﬁt.  Old

ﬁrms  expand  and  new  ﬁrms  enter,  so  the  demand  of  inputs  increase,  and  so  do 
the prices of inputs.  Firm’s cost  curves increase to  LM C ′  and  LAC ′  / Since now 
ﬁrms have zero proﬁt, new  ﬁrms stop  entering.  The quantity  supplied increases 
but  is  still  ﬁnite.  Thus  the  supply  curve  is  upward  sloping.

Figure  6:  Consumer  Surplus  and  Producer  Surplus. 

C S  (Consumer Surplus) plus P S  (Producer Surplus) is maximized at the quan­
tity  when  demand  equals  supply. 

Price  Ceiling 

When  there  is  no  intervention,  the  equilibrium  price  and  quantity  are  P ∗  and 
Q∗ , respectively.  Now government sets a price ceiling, namely, a maximum price 
¯P  (see Figure 7).  The  changes in  consumer  surplus and producer surplus  are as 
follows: 

ΔC S  =  A −  B , 
ΔP S =  −A −  C, 
ΔC S + ΔP S  =  −B −  C. 
Deadweight  loss,  or  net  loss  of  C S + P S , is  −(B + C ) in  this  case.  Government 
should  maximize  economic  eﬃciency:  maximize  C S  +  P S . 
If  policies  cause 
deadweight  loss,  they  impose  an  economy  cost  on  the  economy.

Price  Floor 

Government sets a price  ﬂoor (price support), namely, a minimum price P  (see 
Figure  8).  The  changes  in  consumer  surplus  and  producer  surplus  from  the 
competitive  equilibrium (P ∗ , Q∗) to the  new  equilibrium (P , Q ′) are  as  follows: 

ΔC S  =  −A −  B ;


ΔP S =  A −  C ;


ΔC S + ΔP S  =  −B −  C.


Thus  there  is  still  a  deadweight  loss.
