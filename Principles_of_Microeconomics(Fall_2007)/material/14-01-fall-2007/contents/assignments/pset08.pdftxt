Problem  Set  8

Due:  November  16th


1.	 Please write your name, the name of your TA, and your section/recitation 
time  (e.g.  MWF  10am,  or  F  1  pm)  on  top  of  your  solutions. 

2.	 Problem  sets are due  IN SECTION/RECITATION.  Late Problem  sets 
will  not  be  accepted  under  any  circumstances. 

Questions: 

1.	 Are  the  following  statements  true,  false?  Please  give  an  explanation. 

(a)  (7  points)  A monopolist  producing  at  a  price  and  quantity  where 
−0.5  is  not  maximizing  proﬁts. 
the  elasticity  of  demand  is 
(b)  (7  points)  Since  monopolies  raise  prices  above  the  eﬃcient  level, 
the  government  should  always  break  up  the monopolistic  ﬁrms  or 
foster  entry  into  the market. 
(c)  (7  points)  Unlike  in  a  perfectly  competitive  market,  imposing  a 
price  ceiling  on  a monopolist  may  increase  output. 

2.	 A monopoly  faces market  demand Q = 30 
−
2 q 2 . 
C (q) =  1

 P  and  has  a  cost  function 

(a)  (7  points)  Find  the  proﬁt  maximizing  price  and  quantity  and  the 
resulting  proﬁt  to  the monopoly. 
(b)  (7 points) Find  the price  elasticity  of the demand Edp  at the price 
and quantity  found  in  (a).  Show  that the Lerner  Index  is equal  to 
−1/Edp . 
(c)  (8 points) What  is the socially optimal price?  Calculate the dead­
weight  loss  (DWL)  due  to  the  monopolist  behavior  of  this  ﬁrm. 
Calculate consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). Show 
CS,  PS  and DWL  on  the  diagram. 
(d)  (7  points)  Assume	 that  the  government  puts  a  price  ceiling  on 
the monopolist  at P  = 18.  How much  output will  the monopolist 
produce?  What  will  be  the  proﬁt  of  the  monopolist?  Calculate 
CS,  PS  and DWL. Why  is  the  deadweight  loss  diﬀerent  now?

(e)  (7  points) Assume  that  the  government  put  a  price  ceiling  on  the 
monopolist  in  order  to  maximize  the  total  (i.e.  consumer  plus 
producer)  surplus.  What  price  ceiling  should  it  choose?  How 
much  output  will  the  monopolist  produce  at  this  price  ceiling? 
What  will  the  proﬁt  of  the monopolist  be?  What  is  the  DWL? 
(f )  (8 points) Suppose  the government  charges the monopolist a $130 
fee  for  the  right  to  operate.  The  monopolist  doesn’t  pay  the  fee 
if  it decides  not  to produce.  Find  the proﬁt maximizing  price and 
quantity  and  the  resulting  proﬁts  to  the monopolist. 
Now assume that in addition to the $130 fee,  the government puts 
on  the  monopolist  the  same  price  ceiling  as  in  part  (e).  Will  the 
monopolist  choose  to  produce  in  this  case? 
(g)  (8  points)  Suppose	 the  government  decides  to  impose  a  tax  of 
$3  per  unit  on  the  monopolist.  Find  the  resulting  output,  price, 
government  revenue  and  monopolist’s  proﬁt.  Show  on  a  diagram 
the  consumer  surplus,  the  producer  surplus,  government  revenue 
and  deadweight  loss. 
(h)  (7 points) Assume the monopolist acquired a second factory with a 
cost function C2(q) = 6q , but it still could use the ﬁrst factory with 
1 q 2 .  Find  the  new  proﬁt  maximizing 
the  cost  function  C1(q) =  2
price  and  calculate  the  amount  of  output  produced  in  each  of  the 
two  factories. 

3.	 Suppose  that  North  Pole  Enterprises  makes  ice  sculptors  in  the  North 
Pole  and  ships  them  to  the  United  States,  where  they  are  sold  in  the 
perfectly-competitive  icesculpture  market  for  a  ﬁxed  price  of  100  dol­
lars.  The  primary  input  in  North  Pole  Enterprises  production  is  ice. 
Unfortunately,  NPE  doesn’t  own  any  rich  ice-producing  land  in  the 
North  Pole,  and  hence  must  purchase  ice  from  one  of  the  many  ﬁrms 
that  produce  ice.  The  market  for  ice  is  perfectly  competitive,  with  a 
supply  curve  given  by 

S (r) = r, 
where  r  is  the  price  of  ice.  Since  NPE  is  the  only  demander  of  ice 
produced  in  the  North  Pole,  it  acts  as  a  monopsonist.  Its  production 
function  for  sculptures  is  given  by 

√
F (x) = 2 x,

where  x  is  the  amount  of  ice  it  uses. 

(a)  (7  points)  How much  ice  does  NPE  use? 
(b)  (2  points) What  is  the  price  of  ice? 
(c)  (7 points) Now suppose that the owner of one of the ice companies 
decides  to  move  to  sunny  Florida,  and  so  puts  her  ice  company 
up  for  sale.  Assume  that  NPE  purchases  the  ice  company  (NPE 
is  able  to  operate  the  ﬁrm  exactly  as  eﬃciently  as  the  original 
owner).  The  cost  function  of  the  ice-producing  ﬁrm  is 

c(x) = 

1 
2 x 
2 

(this  is  how  much  it  costs  to  produce  x  units  of  ice)  then  how 
much  ice  will  the monopsonist  use? 
(d)  (4  points)  Maintain  the  assumption  that  NPE  has  purchased  the 
ice-producing  ﬁrm.  Is  there  a  governmental  policy  that  would 
improve  total  welfare  in  the  ice-producing  market  of  the  North 
Pole?  If  so,  brieﬂy  describe what  its  goal would  be.  If  not, brieﬂy 
explain  why  not.
