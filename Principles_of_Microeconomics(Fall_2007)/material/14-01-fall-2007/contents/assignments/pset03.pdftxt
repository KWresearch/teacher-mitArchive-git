Problem  Set  3

Due:  September  28th


1.	 Please write your name, the name of your TA, and your section/recitation 
time  (e.g.  MWF  10am,  or  F  1  pm)  on  top  of  your  solutions. 

2.	 Problem  sets are due  IN SECTION/RECITATION.  Late Problem  sets 
will  not  be  accepted  under  any  circumstances. 

Questions: 

1.	 Are  the  following  statements  true,  false?  Please  give  an  explanation. 

(a)  (8  points)  If  pork  chops  and mashed  potatoes  are  the  only  goods 
consumed  and  they  are  perfect  complements,  then  neither  can  be 
an  inferior  good. 
(b)  (8  points)  Ursula	 and  Jessica  are  dining  at  Stanley’s  Surf  and 
Turf,  which  sells  only  lobsters  and  steaks.  An  economics  student 
working part-time  in the restaurant asks the two customers about 
their marginal  rates of  substitution  (MRS) and discovers  that Ur ­
sula’s  MRS  of  lobster  for  steak  is  –2.  Ursula  and  Jessica  face  the 
same  prices  for  the  two  foods.Therefore,  we  know  Jessica’s  MRS 
of  lobster  for  steak must  also  equal  –2. 

2.	 (8  points)  In  the  ﬁrst  week  of  July,  Bob’s  favorite  store  charges  $2.50 
for  an  ice  cream  and  $1.50  for  a  soda.  Bob  spends  all  his  income  on 
ice-cream and  soda and chooses  to consume 6  ice-creams  and 10  sodas. 
By  the  ﬁrst  week  of  August,  prices  have  risen  to  $3  per  ice-cream  and 
$2 per soda.  Bob’s income has also changed.  He still only consumes ice-
cream  and  soda,  but  he  now  buys  4  ice-creams  and  20  sodas.  Is  Bob’s 
behavior  in  the  two  weeks  consistent  with  valid  indiﬀerence  curves? 
Can  you  determine  in  which  week  Bob  is  better  oﬀ ?  Explain. 

3.	 Anna  spends  all  of  her  income  on  shirts  (S )  and  jeans  (J ).  Anna’s 
√
preferences can be represented by the utility function U (S, J ) = 3 S J . 

(a)  (10  points)  Derive  the  demand  functions  for  shirts  and  jeans  in 
terms  of  the  price  of  shirts  (PS ),  the  price  of  jeans  (PJ ),  and 
income  (I ).

(b)  (4  points)  Draw  the  Engel  curve  for  shirts. 
(c)  (3  points)  Suppose  the  price  of  a  shirt  is  $4,  the  price  of  a  pair  of 
jeans  is  $16,  and  Anna  has  $128  income.  What  bundle  of  shirts 
and  jeans  (S, J )  maximizes  Anna’s  utility? 

(d)  (2  points)  Suppose  the  price  of  a  shirt  increases	 to  $16.  What 
bundle  of  shirts  and  jeans  will  Anna  demand  now? 

(e)  (8  points) Devastated  by  the  sudden  price  increase,  Anna  decides 
to  ask  her  brother  for  money  to  help  ﬁnance  her  clothing  pur ­
chases.  How  much  total  income  does  Anna  need  to  remain  as 
happy  as  she  was  before  the  price  change? 

(f )  (3 points) If Anna has exactly enough income to keep her as happy 
as she was before the price change, what bundle of shirts and jeans 
will  Anna  demand? 

(g)  (10  points)  Unfortunately,	 Anna’s  brother  refuses  to  give  Anna 
any  money.  She  is  now  back  to  the  situation  in  part  c:  the  price 
of shirts has increased from $4 to $16, and her income remains un­
changed  at  $128.  Decompose  the  total  change  in  consumption  of 
shirts and jeans purchased into a substitution eﬀect and an income 
eﬀect.  In  a  clearly-labeled  diagram  with  shirts  on  the  horizontal 
axis,  draw  the  income  and  substitution  eﬀects  of  the  increase  in 
the  price  of  a  shirt. 

4.	 There are 100 consumers in the economy.  Half of them belong to tribe A 
and demand  oranges  according  to  the  individual  inverse  demand  curve 
P  =  10 
 2Q.  The  other  half  belong  to  tribe  B  and  demand  oranges 
−
according to the individual inverse demand curve P  = 16−4Q.  Suppose 
that  the market-clearing  price  for  oranges  is  $4. 

(a)  (4  points)  At  the  market-clearing  price,  how  many  oranges  does 
each  member  of  tribe  A  buy?  What  is  the  price  elasticity  of  de­
mand  by  a member  of  tribe  A  at  this  point?

(b)  (4  points)  At  the  market-clearing  price,  how  many  oranges  does 
each  member  of  tribe  B  buy?  What  is  the  price  elasticity  of  de­
mand  by  a member  of  tribe  B  at  this  point? 

(c)  (12  points)  What  is  the  market  demand  for  oranges  in  this  econ­
omy?  Is  the market  demand  function  linear?  If  not,  where  is  the 
kink? 

(d)  (6  points)  Using  the  market  demand  function  derived  in  part  c., 
what  is  the  total  quantity  of  oranges  demanded  in  this  economy 
at  the  market-clearing  price?  (Hint:  check  that  this  is  consistent 
with  your  answers  to parts a.  and b.)  What  is  the  price  elasticity 
of market demand  at this point?  Is the absolute value of the price 
elasticity  of market  demand  larger  than  the  absolute  value  of  the 
price  elasticity  of  individual  demand? 

(e)  (10  points)  If  the  price  increases	 from  $4  to  $10,  how  does  the 
consumer  surplus  chage?  Graph  the  demand  curve  with  quantity 
on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis,  and  show the 
change  in  consumer  surplus.
