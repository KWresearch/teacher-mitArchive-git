Econ  14.01  Fall  2007

PS2:


The  due  date  for  this  assignment  is  Friday  September  21. 

1.	 True  or  false  (15  points).  Explain. 

(a)	 If  the marginal  rate  of  substitution  between  two  goods A  and B  is  not  equal  to  1, 
then  it  is  possible  for  these  two  goods  to  be  perfect  substitute. 
(b)	 If  the price  elasticity  of demand  is  1  along demand  curve,  then when  the quantity 
of  sale  is  doubled,  the  seller’s  revenue  is  also  doubled. 
(c)	 When  the  consumer maximizes  his utility over  two  goods,  the marginal utilities of 
each  good  are  always  equal. 

2.	 (20  points)  Suppose  the  demand  for  the  IBM  personal  computer  is: 

Qd  = 2400 − 4p 

(a)  At  what  price  is  the  price  elasticity  of  demand  equal  to  zero? 
(b)  When the price elasticity of demand equal to 1, what’s the quantity being demand 
at  that  point? 
(c)  Figure  out  at  what  price,  the  price  elasticity  of  demand  is  inﬁnite,  and  explain 
what  does  inﬁnite  price  elasticity  of  demand mean? 
(d)  What’s  the  change  of  revenue  generated  by  sale  when  the  price  elasticity  of  de­
mand  falls  from  inﬁnite  to  1. 

3.	 (16  points)  Draw  a  set  of  indiﬀerence  curves  for  the  following  pairs  of  goods: 

•	 Meat  and  carrots  for  a  vegetarian  who  neither  likes  nor  dislikes  meat. 
•	 Bread  and milk  for  an  individual  who  always  consume  them  together. 
•	 Fortune  and  Business  Week  for  an  individual  who  regard  this  two  magzine  are 
perfect  substitute. 
•	 Ice  cream  and  pie  if  these  are  goods  that  you  like,  but  if  you  eat  too  much  of 
either,  you  get  sick  of  them.  If  you  are  sick  of  a  good,  eating  more  of  it  lowers 
you  utility. 
(Note:  need  not  to  be  precise,  but  the  key  idea  is  to  describe  the  how 
indiﬀerence  curve’s  slope  changes  in  diﬀerent  situations) 
•	 (You  also  can  look  the  following  example)

4  (21 points) Bob’s  utility  function  over  good X  and Y  is U(X,Y)=10X+5Y. His  income

is  100  and  the  price  of X  is  2  and  price  of Y  is  5. 

(a)  Calculate  the marginal  rate  of  substitution  (MRS)  between  X  and  Y  (6  points). 
(b)  How  much  of X  and Y  will  Bob  buy?  (6  points) 
(c)  Would  Bob’s  decision  change,  if  Bob’s  utility  function  is  now 

5  (28  points,  7  for  each)  Ann  consumes  two  goods  X  and  Y,  his  utility  function  is 
U (X, Y ) = 2X Y 2 .  Suppose  the  price  of  X  is  $10,  while  the  price  of  Y  is  $15.  Ann’s 
income  is  $500. 

(a)	 Write  the  expression  for  indiﬀerence  curve  when  Ann  gets  utility  level  40.  And 
along  the indiﬀerence  curve you  found,  calculate out the numbers  of consumption 
of  X when  Y=4. 
(b)	 Write the expression for Ann’s budget constraint, graph the budget constraint and 
determine  its  slope. 
(c)	 Determine  the X, Y  combination which maximizes Ann’s  utility,  given  her budget 
constraint.  And  ﬁgure  out  what’s  marginal  rate  of  substitution  (MRS)  between 
two  goods  at  that maximization  point. 
∂U 
Note:  You  can  deﬁne  M RS  =	 ∂U  either  way  is  ﬁne.

∂X 
∂Y

(d)	 Suppose now the price of X is changed to 15, calulate the impact on Ann’s optimum 
choice.  What’s  the  change  to  her  maximized  utility?
