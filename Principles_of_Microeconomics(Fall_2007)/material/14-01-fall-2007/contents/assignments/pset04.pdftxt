Problem Set 4

Due October 5, 2007


1.  Please write your name,  the name of your TA, and your 
section/recitation time (e.g. MWF 10am, or F 1 pm) on top of your solutions. 
2.  Problem sets are due IN SECTION/RECITATION. Late Problem sets 
will not be accepted under any circumstances. 
Questions 
1.  Are the following true,  false or uncertain? Explain why. 
a.  (7 points) Many people buy  insurance against  their home burning 

down and also purchase  lottery  tickets  for  large prizes. (The 

insurance and  lottery  tickets both have negative expected value.)

These people cannot be maximizing the expected utility of  their

wealth. 

b.  (7 points) Jenna owns $5000 worth of Microsoft stock and no other 
stocks. She  is deciding whether  to  invest another $5000  from her 
chequing account  in General Electric stock.  If Jenna  is risk averse, 
she should buy  the General Electric stock  in order  to diversify her 
portfolio. 
2.  Zack  is an MIT student who  lives  in Harvard Square. Each morning he 
takes  the train or  the bus  to school. Riding the bus  takes 5 minutes with 
probability 1/4 and 20 minutes with probability 3/4. Riding  the train takes 7 
minutes with probability 1/2 and 12 minutes with probability 1/2. 
a.  (5 points)  If Zack  is risk neutral and only cares about minimizing his 
travel  time, does he take the train or  the bus? If he values his  time 
at $0. 25 per minute, how much more  is he willing  to pay  for his 
preferred method of  transportation? 
b.  (10 points) Assume Zack values his  time at $0. 25 per minute. He 

can purchase an MBTA report each morning that  tells what  the 

actual travel time will be for both the bus and the subway. How

much  is he willing to pay  for  this  information? (Travel  times on the 

bus and subway are  independent.)

3.  Tim  is a fan of  the New England Patriots; he  is risk averse, and he 
wants  to maximize his expected utility. After  the Patriots play a game, Tim’s 
utility will be uW  P  if  the Patriots win and uW − P  if  the Patriots  lose, 
where W  is his wealth.

a.  (7 points) This week  the Patriots are playing against  the Pittsburgh 
Steelers;  they have a 1/2 probability of winning  the game. Tim can 
bet any amount B on either  team. Letting W 0  be Tim’s wealth before 
the game, he will have wealth W 0   B  if  the team he bets on wins 
and wealth W 0  − B  if  the team he bets on  loses. How much should 
Tim bet, and on which team? 
b.  (7 points) Next week  the Patriots will be playing against  the 
Philadelphia Eagles;  they have a 2/3 probability of winning  that 
game.  If Tim bets B on the Patriots, he will gain 0. 5B when the 
Patriots win and  lose B when the Patriots  lose.  If Tim bets B on the 
Eagles, he will  lose B when the Patriots win and gain 2B when the 
Patriots  lose. How much should Tim bet, and on which team? 
4.  Jane  is a farmer who can plant either potatoes or corn on her  land. Both 
choices are risky, and her profits will depend on the Fall weather according to 
the following table: 

Fall Weather  Potatoes  Corn 
Cold 
1000 
4000 
Normal 
8000 
8000 
Warm 
6000 
11, 000 

There  is a 1/4 probability  that  the Fall will be cold, a 1/2 probability  that  the 
Fall will be normal, and a 1/4 probability  that  the Fall will be warm. 
a.  (8 points) Calculate Jane’s expected profits and standard deviation 
for each crop. 
b.  (8 points)  If Jane’s utility  function over  this year’s  income  is 
uy    y  and she has $2000 of  income from other sources (so her 
total  income  is crop profits plus $2000), which crop would she rather 
plant? 
c.  (9 points) Now suppose that Jane can plant a fraction  of her  land 
with Potatoes and a fraction 1 −  with Corn. That  is,  if   . 6,  then 
Jane would get 60% of  the Potato profits and 40% of  the Corn profits 
for whatever  type of weather occurred. What value of  will Jane 
choose? 
5.  Emre has an  income of $10, 000 per year. There  is a 1/5 probability  that 
he will need mayor dental surgery  in the next year, which would cost $5000 
but wouldn’t otherwise affect his well-being. He has utility  function 
uW    lnW over his wealth. 
a.  (5 points) An  insurance company offers Emre a dental policy where 
he pays a price p ∗ C  for C dollars of coverage. That  is, Emre pays

the company p ∗ C whether he needs surgery or not, and  the 
company pays him C  if he ends up requiring the surgery. What  is 
the actuarially  fair price for one dollar of coverage (p)? 
b.  (9 points)  If  the  insurance company offers Emre a policy at  the 
actuarially  fair price, how much coverage will Emre buy? 
c.  (9 points) Suppose the  insurance company doesn’t offer him  the 
actuarially  fair price–instead,  they  take a profit of $0. 05 per dollar of 
coverage (so  if  the actuarially  fair premium  is p f ,  they charge 
p    p f   0. 05). How much  insurance will Emre buy now? 
d.  (9 points) Now suppose that Emre’s  income  is y (not necessarily 
$10, 000) and that  the  insurance company charges some premium p. 
The probability of needing surgery  is still 1/5, and the cost of 
surgery is still $5000. Find Emre’s optimal  level of coverage for 
arbitrary y    0 and any p greater  than the actuarially  fair rate from 
part (a). (Note: pay attention to the possibility of a corner solution 
where Emre buys no  insurance.)  Is  the amount of  insurance Emre 
buys  increasing or decreasing  in y?
