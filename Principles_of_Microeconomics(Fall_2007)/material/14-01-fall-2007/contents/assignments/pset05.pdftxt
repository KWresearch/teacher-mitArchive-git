14.01, Fall 2007 
Problem Set 5 
Due October 19, 2007 
 
 
1.  Please write your name,  the name of your TA, and your section/recitation 
time (e.g. MWF 10am, or F 1 pm) on top of your solutions. 
2.  Problem  sets  are  due  IN  SECTION/RECITATION.  Late  Problem  sets will 
not be accepted under any circumstances. 

Questions 
 
1.  Are the following true, false or uncertain? Explain why. 
 
•  a)  If  there  are  no  fixed  costs  and  the  marginal  costs  are  strictly 
increasing,  then  the  average  cost  curve  is  always  bellow  the 
marginal cost curve. (6 points) 

 
•  b)  If a  firm’s expansion path  is a straight  line starting on  the origini, 
that  implies  that we  have  constant  returns  to  scale  (Hint  –  think  of 
the Cobb-Douglas production function). (7 points) 

 
•  c)  Theresa  bought  a  store  in  2001  for  600,000$.  In  2002,  she 
decided  to  open  a  business  in  that  store,  which  brought  her 
100,000$  per  year,  in  the  last  5  years.  The  business  has  to  be 
closed  now  due  to  a  fire.  Was  having  that  business  open  a 
sensible choice by Theresa? (7 points) 

2.  In  Liz’s  tomato  plantation,  tomatoes  can  be  picked  just  using  labor  or 
using a combination of labor and tractors. The more tractors are used, the 
fewer  workers  can  be  given  up  per  tractor,  in  order  to  catch  the  same 
amount  of  tomatoes.  Draw  a  representative  isoquant  for  Liz’s  plantation. 
(10 points) 

3.  Peter’s  movie  theater  is  always  completely  sold  out  on  Friday  and 
Saturday, but only half  its capacity  is  filled on  the other days of  the week. 
The theater has 100 seats and the operational costs of having the theater 
open and running amount to 200 dollars per session. What is the average 
cost  per  person  on  Friday/Saturday  and  on  the  other  weekdays?  How 
would  you  advice  Peter  on  what  kind  of  movie  goers  he  should  try  to 
attract, Friday/Saturday night ones or weekday night ones? (10 points)

4.  Jen owns a factory of automobiles. Due to an increase in the interest rate, 
the  rental  cost  of  the  capital  she  employs went  up.  Show  graphically,  the 
effect of this change on the expansion path of Jen’s firm. (10 points)

6.  Debbie’s firm faces the following production function: 

q = K0.5(L-1)0.5

a)  On  the  short  run,  capital  cannot  be  changed  and  is  equal  to  25. What will 
be  the cost of producing 25 units,  if  the  rental cost of capital  is 20 and  the 
wage is 5? (2 points) 
b)  Get  the  expression  for  total  cost,  variable  cost,  marginal  cost,  average 
total cost and average variable cost. (6 points) 
c)  Graph total cost, variable cost and fixed cost in one graph. Graph marginal 
cost average cost, average total cost and average variable cost  in another 
graph. (4 points) 
d)  At what quantity is the average total cost minimized? (4 points) 
e)  What can Debbie do when we get to the long run? (2 points) 
f)  What is the MRTS, as a function of K and L? (3 points) 
g)  Find the long run cost function. (10 points) 
h)  Draw the firm’s expansion path. (4 points)
