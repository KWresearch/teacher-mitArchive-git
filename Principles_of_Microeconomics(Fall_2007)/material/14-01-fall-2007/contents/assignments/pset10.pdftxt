Problem  Set  10 
Due:  December  7th 

1.	 Please write your name, the name of your TA, and your section/recitation 
time  (e.g.  MWF  10am,  or  F  1  pm)  on  top  of  your  solutions. 

2.	 Problem  sets  are  due  IN  SECTION/RECITATION.  Late  Problem  sets 
will  not  be  accepted  under  any  circumstances. 

Questions: 

1.	 Are  the  following  statements  true,  false  or  uncertain? 

a.	 Since  many  of  the  products we  buy  every  day  are  produced  by  ﬁrms  that 
compete  in monopolistically  competitive markets,  the  ineﬃciencies  in  our 
economies  are  large  because  each  market  is  generating  some  dead  weight 
loss. 

b.	 The  main  reason  why  policymakers  are  concerned  about  inﬂation  is  be ­
cause  it  raises  wages,  therefore  costs  of  production.  As  a  result  output 
and  employment  necessarily will  go  down. 

2.	 Two  ﬁrms  with  0  marginal  costs  compete  by  choosing  price.  Their  de ­
mand  functions  are 

Q1  = 20 − P1  + P2 
Q2  = 20 + P1  − P2 

(1) 
(2) 

a.	 Suppose  the  two  ﬁrms  choose  their  price  simultaneously.  What  are  the 
prices,  quantities  and  proﬁts  of  each  ﬁrm  in  the  resulting  Nash  Equilib­
rium?  How  do  we  call  this  type  of  competition?  How  is  it  diﬀerent  from 
Cournot competition?  Why we do not get the result that P1  = P2  = M C ? 

b.	 Suppose Firm 1  sets  its price ﬁrst and Firm 2 sets  its price after observing 
Firm´s 1 price.  What are the prices, quantities and proﬁts in equilibrium? 

c.	 What  ﬁrm  has  an  advantage  in  this  setup? Why? 

3.	 Firm A and B are deciding between producing high or low quality product. 
The proﬁt of each ﬁrm depends on the action taken by its competitor.  The 
payoﬀ matrix  is: 

Firm  B 
H 
50,  40 
55,  55 

L 
60,  45 
15,  20 

Firm  A  H 
L

a.	 Find  the  maximin  strategies  of  each  ﬁrm. 

b.	 Find  the  Nash  Equilibria  of  this  game.  Explain  why  they  are  equilibria 
by  checking  potential  deviations. 

c.	 Now  suppose  that  the  ﬁrms  take  their  actions  sequentially.  Write  the 
extensive  form  game  if  Firm  A  moves  ﬁrst  and  ﬁnd  the  equilibrium  of 
that  game. 

d.	 Suppose  you  are  the  CEO  of  Firm  A  and  you  still  decide  the  quality  of 
the  product  ﬁrst.  The  CEO  of  Firm  B  goes  on  national  TV  and  says  ”I 
don´t care what Firm A is going to do.  I´m going to produce high quality 
products  (H) because I don´t like  low quality stuﬀ”.  What would you do? 

e.	 What  will  be  the  equilibrium  if  Firm  B  moves  ﬁrst?  Is  there  a  ﬁrst  or 
second  mover  advantage?  How  does  this  relate  to  your  answer  in  2d? 
Why? 

f.	 How  is  this  game  diﬀerent  than  the  Prisoner´s Dilemma. 

4.	

Imagine  you  are  a  professor  at  MIT  and  you  are  considering  hiring  Re ­
search  Assistants  (RA).  If  you  hire  an  RA  for  L  hours  your  RAs  will 
produce  an amount of  research output  given by Q = 12L − L2 .  You  value 
the  output  of  their  research by  $10. 

a.	 Find  the Marginal  Revenue Product  of  Labor  and  draw  it. 

b.	 Suppose  there  are  100  professors  like  you  at  MIT.  Find  the  aggregate 
demand  for  RA  labor. 

c.	 Students  at MIT have a  large opportunity cost for working as RA  (spend­
ing  their  time  studying  14.01),  so  their  aggregate  supply  for  RA  work  is 
given by Ls  = 15w.  Find  the wage of  equilibrium  in  the MIT RA market. 

d.	 How many  hours  of  RA  work would  you  hire  at  that wage? 

e.	 Are  the  labor demands you found the conditional or the unconditional de ­
mands?  Brieﬂy describe  the  diﬀerence between  them and draw a  diagram 
showing  both.
