Problem  Set  7

Due:  November  2nd.


1.  Please  write  your  name  and  name  of  your  TA  on  the  top  of  your  solutions. 
2.  Problem  sets  are  due  IN  SECTION/RECITATION.  Late  Problem  sets  will 
not  be  accepted  under  any  circumstances 

1.	 True  or  False  (18  points) 

•	 a) Under perfect  competitive market,  since  the ﬁrm’s maximized  proﬁt  is  zero,  so 
marginal  revenue  is  always  not  equal  to  long  run marginal  cost.  (8  points) 
•	 b) If the market  is perfect competitive,  the government can not  improve eﬃciency 
by  imposing  a  price  ceiling  or  price  ﬂoor.(5  points) 
•	 c)  In  an  Edgeworth  box,  all  points  of  tangency  between  the  indiﬀerence  curves 
are  eﬃcient  (if  tangency  is  applicable).  (5  points) 

2.	 (20  points)  Suppose  the  oil  price  in  world market  is  $60  per  gallon,  the  U.S.  domestic 
demand  curve  of  oil  is


Qd  = 200 − 2p


and  domestic  supply  curve  is 

1 
Qs  =  p
3

•	 a)  (10  points)  If  U.S.  government  imposes  a  tariﬀ  of  $15  per  gallon,  what  will  be  the 
U.S.  price  and  the  level  of  import?  How  much  revenue  will  be  the  government  earn 
from  the  tariﬀ ?  How  large  is  the  deadweight  loss? 

•	 b)  (10 points)  If  the U.S.  government  has  no  tariﬀ but  imposes  an  import  quota  of 25, 
what  will  be  the  deomestic  price?  what  is  the  cost  of  this  quota  for U.S.  consumers  of 
the  oil?  What  is  the  gain  for U.S.  producers? 

3.	 (20 points)The  supply  curve  for alcohol  is  qs  = 2p − 1,  and demand  curve  is qd  = 8 − p. 
Suppose  that  the  local  authority  starts  to  tax  alcohol  at  $1.5  per  unit.

a)  (5  points)  Calculate  the  equilibrium  price  and  quantity  before  the  authority  starts

to  tax.

b)  (5  points)  Calculate  the  loss  in  producer’s  surplus.

c)  (5  points)  Calculate  the  revenue  generated  by  tax.

d)  (5  points)What  percentage  of  the  burden  of  the  tax  falls  on  producer.


4.	 (42  points)  Ann  and  Bob  are  two  individuals.  They  both  consume  Food  and  Cloth. 
Ann’s  utility  function  is


and  Bob’s  utility  function  is


UA (F , C ) = F 2C


UB (F , C ) = F C

Suppose  that  Ann  is  endowed  with  9  units  F  and  3  units  C,  but  Bob  is  endowed  with

6  units  F  and  6  units  C.

a)  (5  points) Write  expression  for Ann  and  Bob’s marginal  rate  of  substitution;

b)  (7  points)  Draw  the  Edgeworth  box  and mark  the  initial  endowment  point;

c)  (5  points)  Point  out  the  area  in  the  box  that  represents  all  the  bundles  that  make

both  of  them  better  oﬀ,  comparing  with  initial  endowment;

d)  (7  points)  Derive  the  contract  curve;

e)  (18  points)  Find  the  general  equilibrium  of  the  above  economy  and  calculate  the

welfare  gain  of  the  society  through  exchange;
