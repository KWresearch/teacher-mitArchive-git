Problem  Set  1

Due:  September  14th


1.	 Please write your name, the name of your TA, and your section/recitation 
time  (e.g.  MWF  10am,  or  F  1  pm)  on  top  of  your  solutions. 

2.	 Problem  sets are due  IN SECTION/RECITATION.  Late Problem  sets 
will  not  be  accepted  under  any  circumstances. 

Questions: 

1.	 For  each  of  the  following  scenarios,  use  a  supply  and  demand  diagram 
to  illustrate  the  eﬀect  of  the  given  shock  on  the  equilibrium  price  and 
quantity  in  the  speciﬁed  competitive market.  Explain whether  there  is 
a  shift  in  the  demand  curve,  the  supply  curve,  or  neither. 

(a)  (8  points)  The  MBTA  decides  to  increase  the  price  of  a  T-token 
from  $  1.25  to  $  1.70,  and  also  increases  the  price  of  monthly  T-
passes.  Show the eﬀect on demand, supply and on the equilibrium 
in the greater Boston area market  for used cars.  Are T-passes and 
cars  substitutes  or  complements? 
(b)  (8  points)  America  is  the  biggest  producer  of  corn  in  the  world. 
Bad  weather  conditions  in  the  Midwest  lead  to  a  very  low  pro ­
duction  of  corn  in  the  USA.  Show  the  eﬀect  on  the  world  corn 
market. 
(c)  (8 points) The US government  has  introduced a price  cap on steel 
a couple of years ago.  The  excess  demand  for  steel has  resulted  in 
many complaints by lobbying groups in Washington, and to please 
these,  the  government  raises  the  price  cap  on  steel  from  $100/ton 
to  $125/ton.  This  is  however  still  below  the  free  market  price  of 
$150/ton.  Show  the  eﬀect  on  the market  for  steel. 
(d)  (8  points)  US  steel  mills  buy  their  coal  in  Latin  America.	 Show 
the  eﬀect  of  the  above  mentioned  policy  (in  (c))  on  the  Latin 
American  coal market. 
(e)  (8  points)  The	 popularity  of  a  new  fad  diet  causes  consumers’ 
tastes to shift away  from bread.  Show the eﬀect on the market  for 
butter,  which  is  used mainly  when  people  eat  toast.

2.	 Consider  the market  for  butter.  The  demand  curve  is  given  by 
Qd  = 300 − 2 × P  + 4 × I , 
where  I  is  the  average  income.  The  supply  curve  is 
Qs  = 3P  − 25 × P M 
− 25,

where  P M  is  the  price  of milk.


(a)  (10  points)  If  the  average  income  in Cambridge  is  I  = 25  and  the 
price  of  milk  is  P M  =  1,  what  is  the  market  clearing  price  and 
quantity  in  Cambridge? 
(b)  (10 points) Suppose that bad weather conditions raise the price of 
milk  to  P M  =  2.  Find  the  new  equilibrium  price  and  quantity  of 
butter  in  Cambridge.  (Draw  a  graph  to  illustrate  your  answer). 
(c)  (10  points)  If  the  average  income  in Beverly  Hills  is  I  = 50, what 
is  the  market  clearing  price  and  quantity  in  Beverly  Hills  when 
P M  =  1?  Compare  your  results  with  the  ones  you  have  obtained 
in  (a). 

3.	 Suppose  the  market  demand  and  market  supply  for  apartments  in  a 
city  are  given  by  the  following  functions: 
Qd  = 5000 − 3p

Qs  = 1000 + p.


(a)  (10  points)  At  what  price  does  the  market  for  apartments  in  the 
city  clear?  How many  apartments  are  rented  at  this  price? 
(b)  (10 points) Suppose  the city  sets a maximum  rent  at $1200.	 Illus­
trate  the  rent  control  in  a  supply  and  demand  diagram.  Is  there 
a  shortage?  If  so,  what  is  the  excess  demand? 
(c)  (10 points) Suppose that there is a binding rent control law.	 What 
must  be  true  of  the  maximum  rent  imposed  by  the  city  for  it  to 
be  binding?  Will  there  be  an  excess  demand  or  supply  of  apart ­
ments  at  this price?  Further,  suppose  that  in  response  to the  rent 
control  law,  some  (but  not  all)  landlords  decide  to  convert  their 
apartments  to  condominiums,  which  are  not  sub ject  to  rent  con­
trol.  What will  the eﬀect on the rental market  for apartments be? 
Show  using  a  diagram.
