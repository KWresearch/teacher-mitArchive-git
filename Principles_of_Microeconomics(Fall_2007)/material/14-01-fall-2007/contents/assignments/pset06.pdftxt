Problem  Set  6 
Due:  October  26th 

1.	 Please write your name, the name of your TA, and your section/recitation 
time  (e.g.  MWF  10am,  or  F  1  pm)  on  top  of  your  solutions. 

2.	 Problem  sets are due  IN SECTION/RECITATION.  Late Problem  sets 
will  not  be  accepted  under  any  circumstances. 

Questions: 

1.	 Are  the  following  statements  true,  false?  Please  give  an  explanation. 

(a)  (7  points) Although  a  proﬁt maximizing  ﬁrm  in  a  competitive  in­
dustry may earn negative proﬁts in the short run, producer surplus 
will  always  be  non-negative. 
(b)  (7  points)  For  a  given  technology  and  input  prices,  the  long  run 
average and marginal costs are always below the short run average 
and marginal  costs  (respectively)  for  any  level  of  output. 
(c)  (7 points) Long-run market  supply curves are always ﬂat at prices 
equal  to minimum  average  cost. 
(d)  (7  points)  Consumers  are  always  made  worse  oﬀ  by  government 
policies  that  generate  dead  weight  losses. 

2.	 For the production  function Q = K + 3L,  (a)  say what  returns  to  scale 
it  exhibits,  (b)  say  what  economies  of  scale  it  exhibits. 

3.	 Green  Giant  Inc.  is  willing  to  hire  anybody  to  work  in  its  ﬁelds  and 
grow beans for a wage of $10 per hour.  Luke has his own farm where he 
grows  beans  with  droids  and  labor.  Droid  services  cost  $10  per  hour. 
√
The  production  function  is:  q = F (K, L) =  K L, where K  represents 
droid  hours  and  L  represents  Luke’s  own  labor  in  hours. 

(a)  (8  points)  Assume	 Luke  decides  to  produce  q  =  10, 000.  How 
much  labor  and  capital  will  he  employ?

(b)  (7  points)  Assume  that  in  the  short  run,  Luke  has  already  paid 
for  10, 000  hours  of  droid  services.  Find  the  total  cost,  average 
cost  and marginal  cost  functions  (in  terms  of  output  q). 
(c)  (7 points) With the same assumptions as in the previous question, 
suppose  that  the  market  price  for  beans  is  equal  to  $100.  Find 
Luke’s  farm’s  short-run  bean  output.  Is  there  a  bean  price  low 
enough  so  that  Luke  will  stop  producing  in  the  short  run?  If  so, 
ﬁnd  it.  Do  the  same  for  the  long  run. 
(d)  (6  points)  Without  doing  any  computation,  describe  the  shapes 
of  the  long  run  average  and  marginal  cost  curves.  How  do  they 
relate  to  each  other? 

4.	 There  is  a  single  production  technology  available  to  ﬁrms  that  might 
choose  to  operate  in  the  market  for  hammers.  The  cost  function  asso ­
ciated  with  this  technology  is  given  by  C (q) = 3 + 3q 2 ,  for  any  q  >  0, 
but the costs of production are equal to zero if q = 0.  That is C (0) = 0. 

(a)  (4  points)  Find  the  average  cost  and marginal  cost  functions. 
(b)  (7  points)  If  the  price  of  hammers  is  p,  ﬁnd  the  supply  curve  of  a 
single  ﬁrm,  for  all  possible  prices  p > 0.

For  parts  (c)  and  (d)  :  Suppose  that  there  is  free  entry  into  the

hammer market, and the cost functions of ﬁrms don’t change.  The

market  demand  for  hammers  is  given  by  D(p) = 600 
 50p.

−
(c)  (7 points) What is the long-run price  in the market and how much 
does  each  ﬁrm  produce  at  this  price? 
(d)  (7  points)  How many  total  ﬁrms  are  in  the market? 

5.	 (7  points)  Assume  that  the market  demand  and  supply  for X  is 

Qd  = 
Qs  = 

 50Px ,

150 
−
60 + 40Px .


If  the  government  sets  a  price  ﬂoor  of  $10,  what  is  the  change  in  con­
sumer  surplus?  How  much  is  the  resulting  deadweight  loss  to  society?
