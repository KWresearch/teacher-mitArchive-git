1.  True/False Questions (TOTAL: 20  points): 

In  this  section, write whether  each  statement  is True or False.   Please  fully  explain  your 
answer, using a diagram if appropriate. No credit will be given for an answer without an 
explanation. 

(a)  (5  points)  After  Professor  Wheaton  promises  that  no  one  would  fail,  students  never 
study and turn in problem sets again. This is an example of adverse selection problem. 

False. It is an example of moral hazard. 

(b)  (5  points)  When  a  firm  chooses  among  different  projects,  the  one  which  has  the 
highest present value is always the one with the highest yield rate. 

False.  A  big  project  with  small  yield  rate  might  have  higher  present  value  than  a 
small project with high yield rate. 

(c)  (5 points) If the government guarantees a binding price floor for agricultural output 
by purchasing any surplus, then the demand for farm labor will be more elastic. 

True.  With the price guarantee, firms move along their conditional demand curve, 
which is more elastic than the unconditional demand for labor. 

(d)  (5 points) Exploitation Mining Co. is the only employer in the remote town of 
Uranium City and pays its workers $10.00/hour. If the government forces the 
company to raise its wage by a small amount—say to $10.10/hour—then it will hire 
more workers. 

True. This is just like the price regulation example we saw for monopolists, except 
that here the firm is a monopsonist in the market for labor. A regulated small 
increase in the wage will increase the quantity of labor used above the monopsony 
level. 

(e)  (5 points) A factory that pollutes a river has negative externalities on residents along 
the river. If the factory and residents can negotiate, an efficient result can be achieved 
only if the property right of the river is assigned to the residents. 

False. According to the Coase Theorem, as long as the property right is well specified, 
efficiency can be achieved no matter who owns the river.

Long Questions: 

3. (25 points) Suppose that Intel has a monopoly in the market for computer chips. In 
order to produce X computer chips, it costs Intel C(X) = 2X2 . 

(a)  (2 points) Find the marginal cost of producing a computer chip for Intel.


Solution: MC X(

)

 = 4 X  .  


(b)  (6  points)  The  demand  for  computer  chips  is  X D  = 12 − 0.25 P .  Find  the  level  of 
output that maximizes Intel’s profits. What price is Intel charging? 

Solution: We can rewrite the demand function as  P = 48 − 4 X D , so total revenue 
)X  =  X (48  − 4 X ) = 48  X  − 4 X 2  and marginal revenue is  MR X  = 48  − 8
X . 
is  R(
(
)
 
Equating marginal revenue to marginal cost gives 

− 8 X 
 

4 X  = 48
X *  = 4
m 

The price is  P = 48 − 4(4) = 32 . 

(c)  (4 points) What level of output would maximize total surplus in the computer chip 
market? 

Solution: Total surplus is maximized when price equals marginal cost. That is, 

48 − 4 X  = 4 X 
X *  = 6
TS 

(d)  (4  points)  Suppose  the  government  knew  the  demand  and  production  functions. 
Find  a  price  regulation  the  government  could  impose  that  would  induce  Intel  to 
maximize total surplus, i.e., produce the efficient quantity from part (c). 

Solution:  The  price  that  gets  consumers  to  demand  6  units  is  24.  If  the 
government  set  a  regulated  price  cap  at  P = 24 ,  Intel  would  face  a  constant 
marginal revenue function and would choose to produce where  MC = 24 , i.e., at 
the efficient level from part (c). 

(e)  (6  points)  If  the  government  subsidized  Intel  s  for  every  unit  of  computer  chips 
produced, what quantity would  Intel choose as a function of s? Find the choice of 
subsidy  that  maximizes  total  surplus,  i.e.,  induces  Intel  to  produce  the  efficient 
quantity from part (c).

The surplus-maximizing choice of subsidy induces Intel to produce the efficient 
number of chips from part (c). Solving for  X s* ( )  = 6 , we find that a subsidy of 24 
per unit is required. 

(f)	 (3  points)  Both  the  price  regulation  policy  from  part  (d)  and  the  subsidy  policy 
from  part  (e)  maximize  total  surplus.  Is  there  any  reason  someone  might  prefer 
one policy over the other? 

Solution:  While  the  policies  have  the  same  efficiency  characteristics,  they  have 
very  different  distributional  consequences.  The  subsidy  increases  Intel’s  profits 
at  the  expense  of  taxpayers;  the  price  regulation  redistributes  some  of  Intel’s 
profits to consumers.

4.  (25  points)  Firm  1  and  firm  2  are  the  only  producers  of  spring  water  in  the  market. 
The market demand for spring water  is given by P = 70 − Q1  − Q2 . Firm 1 and firm 2 
compete by choosing quantities Q1 and Q2  respectively. Each  firm has a marginal cost 
of 10 and no fixed cost. 

(a)  (5 points) Find out firm 1’s and firm 2’s reaction functions. 
60 − Q2 , Q2  = 
2

60 − Q1 . 
2 

Solution:  Q1  = 

(b)  (5  points)  Suppose  the  two  firms  choose  quantities  simultaneously. What  are  the 
equilibrium price, quantities, and profits of the two firms in this market? 

Solution:  Q1  = Q2  = 20, P = 30 

(c)  (5  points)  Suppose  only  firm  1  has  a  chance  to  bribe  the  government  and  get  the 
right to choose the quantity first, what is the maximum amount of money that firm 
1 is willing to pay? If firm 1 gets to move first, what are the equilibrium quantities 
and  profits  of  firm  1  and  firm  2?  [Hint:  if  firm  1  does  not  bribe  the  government, 
the two firms will choose quantities simultaneously as in (b).] 

Solution:  The  quantity  of  the  first mover  is  30  and  the  profit  is  450.  The  quantity 
of the second mover is 15 and the profit is 225. If firm 1 does not get the right, its 
profit is 400. Therefore, firm 1 is willing to pay is 450-400=50. 

(d)  (5  points)  Now  back  to  the  situation  that  the  two  firms  choose  quantities 
simultaneously.  Suppose  the  two  firms  decide  to  collude  and  share  the  profit 
equally. Assume  that  both  firms  value  their  reputation  and will  behave  according 
to  their  agreement. What  are  the  quantities  they will  choose  for  each  firm? What 
is the profit of each firm? 

Solution: Each firm produces 15 units and gets profit 450. 

(e)  (5  points)  Suppose  the  two  firms  decide  to  collude  and  share  the  profit  equally, 
but  both  firms  do  not  care  about  their  reputation  and might  try  to  take  advantage 
of  the other. Foreseeing  this,  they make a  legally enforceable contract  saying  that 
if  a  firm  does  not  produce  the  quantity  agreed,  it  has  to  pay  some  penalty  to  the 
other  firm.  What  is  the  minimum  amount  of  penalty  that  ensures  each  firm 
producing the right quantity agreed in part (d). 

Solution: Given  the other  firm produces 15 units,  the best response of a  firm  is  to 
produce  22.5  units  and  it  gets  profit  506.25.  Therefore  the  penalty  should  be  at 
least 56.25 so that no one would deviate.

5.  	 (19 points) The country of Economia has  two  industries.  In  the Clothing  industry,  the 
marginal  product  of  labor  is  always  1.  In  the  Steel  industry,  the marginal  product  of 
1 / 2   − 2 ,  where  LS  is  the  total  number  of  workers  employed  in  the  Steel 
labor  is 12L− 
S 
sector. The  total supply of  labor  in Economia  is  fixed at  LC  + LS  = 25 , and  the output 
price  is  1  for  both  Clothing  and  Steel.  [Note  on  calculus:  if  you  have  forgotten,  the 
derivative of aXb is abXb-1.] 

(a)  (7  points)  Suppose  that  the  labor  market  is  perfectly  competitive.  How  many 
workers  will  be  employed  in  the  Clothing  sector,  and  how  many  in  the  Steel 
sector? What  wage  rate  will  workers  in  each  sector  receive?  [Hint: Workers  can 
switch sectors at will. What does that imply about wages in the two sectors?] 

Solution:  Workers  in  each  sector  will  receive  the  same  wage  (equal  to  their 
marginal revenue product), so wC = wS = 1. This implies that LC = 9 and LS = 16. 

(b)  (8 points) Suppose that workers in the Steel sector form a union, which acts as a 
monopolist in supplying labor to the Steel industry. The union chooses a level of 
employment that maximizes the total wages of its members (i.e., it maximizes 
wSLS). How many workers will the union allow to be employed in the Steel sector? 
How many will now be employed in the Clothing sector? What wage rate will 
workers in each sector receive? [You should assume that the prices of Clothing 
and Steel remain 1. The labor market for Clothing workers is still perfectly 
competitive.] 

Solution: The wage rate will still be the marginal revenue product of labor, so the 
union maximizes  L  (12 L−1 / 2   −
. Setting the derivative of total 
L  − 2L
= 12  1 / 2  
2) 
S
S 
S
S 
wages equal to 0, we find that 

6L−1 / 2   2− = 0
S 
LS  = 9 

That is, now 16 workers will be employed in Clothing and only 9 in Steel. 
Workers in each sector still receive their marginal revenue products, so wC = 1 
and wS = 2. 

(c)  (4  points)  If  workers  in  Clothing  had  unionized  in  order  to  increase  their  wage 
rate  instead  of  workers  in  Steel,  what  would  have  happened  to  employment  and 
wages  in each  sector? Explain why.  [No calculations necessary;  just describe  the 
outcome qualitatively.] 

Solution:  Nothing.  Workers  in  the  Clothing  sector  can’t  raise  wages  at  all— 
Clothing firms have a perfectly elastic demand for labor!
