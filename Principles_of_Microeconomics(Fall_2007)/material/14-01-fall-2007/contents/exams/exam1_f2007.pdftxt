1.  True/False Questions (TOTAL: 20  points): 

In  this  section, write whether  each  statement  is True or False.  Please  fully  explain  your 
answer, using a diagram if appropriate. No credit will be given for an answer without an 
explanation. 

(a) (5 points) A risk averse individual that has to decide between two different lotteries 
will always prefer a lottery with less risk.  

(b) (5 points) Steven only consumes two goods: X and Y.  If X is a Giffen good for 
Steven, then Y must be a normal good for Steven.

(c) (5 points) Ann and Bob consume clothes (C) and food (F) only. Ann’s utility function 
is U (C , F ) = a A  ln C + b A  ln F  , and Bob’s utility function is U (C , F ) = a B  ln C + bB  ln F  . 
a A , b A , a B , bB  > 0 . The price of clothes is PC  , and the price of food is  PF  . Ann and Bob 
must have the same marginal rates of substitution (MRS) of clothes for food at the 
optimal level of consumption. 

(d) (5 points) If S and F are perfect complements you must be indifferent between these 
two bundles: 
i.  One unit of S and one unit of F 
ii.  Two units of S and one unit of F

(b) (6 points) Ann and Bob are a couple. They are the only people in the family. Bob’s 
1
inverse demand curve for shirts is P = 5 −  QB  . Ann’s inverse demand curve for shirts 
2 
is  P = 10 − 2Q A . What is their family demand function for shirts? What is their family 
consumption of shirts when the price is 4? What’s their family consumption of shirts 
when the price is 6?

Long Questions: 

3. (15 points) Jane has utility function over her net income U ( I ) = 

I 

(a) (2 points) What are Jane’s preferences towards risk? Is she risk averse, risk neutral 
or risk loving? [Explain briefly your answer] 

(b) (6 points) Jane drives to work every day and she spends a lot of money in parking 
meters. Many days the thought of cheating and not paying for parking crosses her 
mind. However she knows that there is a ¼ probability of being caught in a given 
day if she cheats, and that the cost of the ticket is $36. Her daily income is $100. 
What is the maximum amount of she will be willing to pay for one day parking? 
[Hint: by paying that amount she avoids the risk of getting a ticket!].

(c) (2 points) Paul also faces the same dilemma every single day. But he has a utility 
function U(I)=I. His daily income is also $100. What are Paul’s preferences 
towards risk? Is he risk averse, risk neutral or risk loving? 

(d) (5 points) If the price of one day parking is 9.25, will Paul cheat or pay the 
parking meter? Will Jane cheat or pay the parking meter under this price?

4. (25 points) In Country Faraway, cigarettes are forbidden, so people trade cigarettes in a 
black market. The cigarette demand is  QD  = 12 − P , and the cigarette supply is  Qs  = 2P . 

(a) (3 points) Find the equilibrium price and quantity in the black market. 

(b) (6 points) The government becomes aware of the black market and reinforces the 
police so that half of the cigarette supply would be seized and destroyed. Under 
this circumstance, what are the demand and supply functions? What is the new 
equilibrium price and quantity? Show the change by using a supply and demand 
diagram.

(c) (4 points) How does the consumer surplus change between (a) and (b)? 

(d) (8 points) Suppose that the government changes the policy and legalizes cigarette 
trade. Now cigarettes are traded in an open market. However, for every unit of 
cigarette purchased, the buyer has to pay tax T to the government. T is equal to 
the pre-tax price P. What are the demand and supply functions under this 
circumstance? What are the equilibrium (pre-tax) price and quantity? What is the 
after-tax price paid by buyers?

does the government prefer? Why?

5. (29 points) Eric receives utility from days spent traveling on vacation domestically (D) 
and days spent traveling in a foreign country (F) as given by the utility U(D, F) = DF. 
The price of a day spent traveling domestically is $160 and in a foreign country $200. 
Eric’s annual budget for traveling is $8,000. 

(a)  (5 points) Find Eric’s utility maximizing choice of days traveling domestically 
and in a foreign country. Find also his utility level from consuming that bundle.  

(b)  (6 points) Suppose that the price of domestic traveling increases to $250 per day. 
Calling his budget for traveling x, (suppose by now that it is unknown) find the 
demand for D and F under the new prices as a function of x.

Page 12 of 18 

(c)  (4 points) Find the income necessary to make Eric reach the same utility level as 
before the price change. 

(d)  (2 points) Compute the quantities demanded with the new prices and the income 
you found in section c. 

(e)  (2 points) Compute the quantities demanded with the new prices and the original 
income.

(f)  (6 points) Using your previous answers tell us what is the total change in quantity 
of D due to the price increase in PD that the consumer experiences and what part 
of that change is due to income or substitution effects. Give definitions of what 
income and substitution effects mean.  

(g)  (4 points) Draw a graph showing the income and substitution effects you found.
