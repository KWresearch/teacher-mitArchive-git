***** Requirements *****
Over the course of the term, you are required to submit six short, analytical
papers of 1000-1200 words on assigned questions about the readings. (Do not
hand in anything under 900 words or more than 1300 words.)Â You are required to
write one paper, and only one paper, from each section of the course. You will
receive questions at the beginning of each section. In writing these short
assignments, you must answer the prepared question. The writing assignments get
you to the central claims and arguments in the reading, and the point of the
assignments is to ensure that you master those claims and arguments. Answering
the questions will not require any research or any reading beyond the week's
assignment. The assignments will not need (or benefit from) footnotes or
literature reviews or surveys of doctrines or any references at all beyond the
assigned reading.
Aside from the short writing assignments, you are required to do four things
for the course:
   1. Do all the reading each week.
   2. Attend and contribute to discussion. To prepare for the discussion, you
      will need to think about the question raised by the writing assignment,
      whether or not you do the writing assignment that week.
   3. Give a short presentation (of no more than 15 minutes) on one week's
      reading assignment. The presentations will focus on a theme from the
      week's readings, and will lead into a discussion, which will be chaired
      by another member of the seminar (other than the presenter and other than
      me). The student making the presentation will decide what to focus the
      presentation on. You may not make a presentation on the topic of the
      writing assignment, but you may take one of the questions for further
      reflection as the focus for your presentation.
   4. Serve as chair for one presentation/discussion. The chair's
      responsibility is to ensure broad participation, keep the discussion
      focused, and enforce the time limits. The chair for the discussion should
      discuss the topic of the presentation with the presenter in advance of
      class.
Finally, I strongly urge that you regularly attend the Work in Progress
Colloquia that meet right after class. You can see the schedule of speakers and
download the papers.
