Convection problem  set 

1 .   Hele-Shaw  Cell  Convect ion  

The   Hele-Shaw  cell  has  a  t h i n   layer  of  fluid  confined  between  two  glass  or  plexiglass 
plates  a t   y = 0  and   y = 6 .   I t   allows  us  t o  s tudy  real  analogues  t o  2-D  flows. 
1) Assume  t h a t   u  and   w  have  t h e  characteristic  parabolic  profile  in   y 

and   t h a t   pressure  and   buoyancy  are   independent  of  y  and   v = 0 .   Take  t h e   y  average  of 
t h e  scaled  equations 

1 D  --u = - V p + R a b i + V 2 u
Pr  D t  
V . u = O  

( b  being  t h e  deviation from 5 = z ) .  Show t h a t   the   averaged  momentum equa t ion  reduces 

when  6  is  very  small  ( t h i n  fluid  layer)  and   t h e  R.ayleigh number  is  big. 
2)  Define  t h e   streanlfunction  and   t h e   y-component  of  t h e   vorticity.  Eliminate  t h e  
pressure  and   write  coupled  equations  for  II, and   b. 
3)  Solve  t h e   linear  s tab i l i ty  problem  and   find  t h e   critical R.ayleigh number  assuming 
free-slip  conditions  on  t o p  and   b o t t om ,  
4)   Consider  now  t h e   iloillinear  problem.  We  could  solve for  weakly  supercritical  con- 
ditions by  assuming t = Ru  - Ra ,   is  small and   expanding in  su i tab le  powers.  However,  it 
is  easier  t o  follow Loreilz  and   examine  a  tru i lca ted   systems.  Derive  t h e  equivalents  t o  t h e  
Loreilz equatioils  for  th is   system.  You  can use  t h e  same expansions  for  b  and   t h e  vorticity 
as  in  t h e   notes.  Show  t h a t   t h e   resulting  equations  have  a  simple  bifurcation  from  t h e  
motionless  s t a t e  t o  a  s tab le   s teady  s t a t e .

A  line  plume  is  driven by  a  s teady  buoyancy  flux per  un i t   length Go  (un i ts  of  m 3 s p 3 )  
on  a  line which  extends  infinitely  far  in  one  horizontal direction  y .   T h e  resu l tan t   plume  is 
therefore  2-dimensional,  w i th   no  variation  in  t h e   y-direction.  En tra inmen t   in to  t h e  plume 
occurs  only  in  t h e   x-direction.  I11  th i s  problem,  we'll examine  t h e  derivation of  t h e  plume 
equations  and   t h e  solutions. 
1) Let  t h e   turbu len t   plume  extend  froin  r ( z )  < x  < r ( z ) .   If  t h e   boundary   were  a n  
impermeable surface,  then  we  would  have

2)  Now  consider  t h e   flux  of  buoyancy,  in tegra t ing   from  O  t o   T +   where  t h e   outside 
buoyancy  value  is  b,. Assume  you  can   replace  t h e   average  of  wb w i th   W  times  B,  t h e  
average  of  b. 
3)  Finally  t r e a t   t h e  vertical  in omen tun^.  T h e  add i t iona l   assumption  is t h a t   t h e  pres- 
4)   Now  look  for  similarity solutions:  assume  W  - z n l  r  - zm  and   find  t h e   solutions 
sure  is t h e  same  as  t h e  environment. 
given  a  uniform  background  buoyancy  be  =  0 .   Make  t h e   en tra inmen t   approximation 
u ,   = uW , where  a  is  a  cons tan t .  
5)  Suppose you can assess t h e  effects of  ro ta t ion  by finding t h e  height  zf  beyond  which 
t h e  plume  R.ossby number Ro  = W / ( f r )   is less  t h a n  1 using t h e  similarity solutions above. 
W h a t   is  zf  and   what  do  you  th ink   might  happen   a t  greater  heights?
