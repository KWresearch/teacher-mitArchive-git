Problem  1.  Temperature  and  salinity  eddy  ﬂuxes. 

The  tracer  conservation  equation  is 
+ �.(uQ) = κQ�2Q 

∂Q 
∂ t 

(1) 

where Q  is  any  tracer,  and  κQ  is  the molecular  diﬀusivity  of  that  tracer. 

(a)  Assuming  that  Q  can  be  split  into  a  large  scale  component  Q  and  a  small  scale 
component  Q� ,  so  that  Q  =  Q + Q�  and  Q�  =  0,  and  similarly  for  the  velocity  ﬁeld, 
write  down  equations  for  the  time-evolution  of  the  large  scale  temperature  T  and 
salinity  S . 

(b) Assume that the small-scale dynamics inﬂuence the large scale ﬁelds only through 
vertical  ﬂuxes, which  can  be  parameterized  in  terms  of diﬀusion  down  the  large  scale 
T  for  temperature  and  κ∗ 
gradient  with  eddy  diﬀusivity  κ∗ 
S  for  salinity.  Rewrite  the 
equations  from  (a)  incorporating  this  parameterization  of  the  small-scale  ﬂuxes. 

(c)  Now  combine  both  equations  from  (b)  to  form  one  equation  for  the  large  scale 
density  ρ  =  βS − αT ,  and  show  that  the  small  scale  ﬂuxes  of  density  can  again  be 
written  in  terms  of  diﬀusion  in  the  direction  of  the  large  scale  density  gradient,  with 
eddy  diﬀusivity

(d)  For  warm  salty  water  overlying  cold  fresh  water,  small-scale  ﬂuxes  of  salt  and 
temperature  may  be  due  to  either  turbulent  mixing,  or  salt-ﬁngering.  In  the  turbu­
lent  regime,  salt  and  heat  are  mixed  equally  eﬃciently.  In  the  salt  ﬁngering  regime 
(αw �T � )/(βw �S � ) ≈ 0.7.  Find κ∗ /κ∗  under these two circumstances.  Comment on the

Problem  2.  Stokes  drift. 
a) Surface gravity waves have ψ � cos k(x − ct) exp(kz ).  Find the particle tra jectories 
at  lowest  order 
∂ 
(X − x0 ) = u(x0 , t)
∂ t
and  then write  the next  order  equations  and ﬁnd  the mean displacement  over  a wave 
period.

b)  Suppose  the  particle  is  constrained  to  a  ﬁxed  depth  z0 .  What  is  its  drift  then? 
What  if  it’s  a  ﬁxed  distance  below  the  free  surface?
