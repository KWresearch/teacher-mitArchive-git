Homework  assignment  1


Problem  1 

The  problem  of  the  onset  of  turbulence  is  an  area  of  active  research.  In  class  we 
brieﬂy discussed the original model proposed by Landau and the more recent  ideas of 
Ruelle and Takens.  The textbooks by Landau and Lifshitz and Tritton have chapters 
on  the  two  theories.  The  article  ”Hydrodynamic  Instabilities  and  the  Transition  to 
Turbulence,”  published  by  H.L.  Swinney  and  J.P.  Gollub  in  Physics  Today  (August 
1978)  is  another  good  review  of  the  issue.  Read  this  material  (and  whatever  else 
you  might  ﬁnd  useful)  and  summarize  the  diﬀerences  between  Landau’s  explanation 
versus the modern view of the onset of turbulence,.  Discuss what  is the observational 
evidence which supports one or the other explanation.  Your answer should not exceed 
a  couple  of  pages. 

Problem  2 

Consider  the  cubic  map, 

xn+1  = r xn (3 − 4x 2 ). 
n
The  parameter  r  plays  the  role  of  a Reynolds  number  in  that  it  controls whether  the 
solutions  are  regular  or  erratic.  The  map  is  deﬁned  in  the  interval  x  ∈  [−1, 1]  and 
r ∈  [0, 1].

Part  1 

Write  a  MATLAB  program  to  draw  the  bifurcation  diagram  of  the  cubic  map  for 
r  ∈  [0, 1].  How  do  the  solutions  change  as  r  becomes  larger?  Is  there  a  transition 
to  a  “chaotic”  behavior?  Does  the  bifurcation  diagram  look  similar  to  the  one  of  the 
logistic map? 

Part  2 

Consider  the  cubic  map  with  r  =  1.  Select  a  set  of  diﬀerent  initial  conditions  x0 
and  plot  the  PDF  of  this  set,  i.e.  the  P (x0 ).  Now  integrate  the  map  for  this  set  of 
initial  conditions,  and  plot  the  PDF  after  n  iterations,  i.e.  the  P (xn ).  Repeat  this 
exercise  for  diﬀerent  values  of  r  in  the  range  [0, 1].  Do  the  PDFs  asymptote  some 
simple  distribution?  How  do  the  PDFs  change  as  a  function  of  r?

Part  3 

Following the steps described in class, ﬁnd the analytical expression for the asymptotic 
PDF  P  of  the  cubic  map  with  r  =  1.  The  ﬁrst  step  is  to  ﬁnd  a  transformation  of 
variables to reduce the cubic map to a piecewise linear map (follow the steps I showed 
in  class  to  reduce  the  logistic  map  to  the  tent  map).  Then  write  an  equation  that 
relates  Pn+1 (x)  and  Pn (x)  for  the  piecewise  linear  map;  this  is  the  Perron-Frobenius 
equation.  Now  ﬁnd  the  equilibrium  solution  of  the  Perron-Frobenius  equation.  The 
last  step  is  to use  this  solution  to express  the asymptotic PDF  for  the cubic map.  All 
these  steps  are  described  in  detail  in  the  book  by  Frisch  for  a  map  which  is  a  close 
relative  of  the  logistic  map.  Does  your  analytical  solution  agree  with  the  numerical 
result  of  part  2?
