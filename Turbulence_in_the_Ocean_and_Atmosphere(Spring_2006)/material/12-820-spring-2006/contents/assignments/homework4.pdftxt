Problem 1.  A Smagorinsky-type model  for  subgridscale ﬂuxes 
in  quasi-geostrophic  turbulence 

� 
� 
The  quasi-gesotrophic  potential  vorticity  governing  equation  on  the  f -plane  is, 
f 2 
∂	
u = (−∂y ψ , ∂xψ),
∂tq + u · �q − ν�2 q = 0, 
∂ z  N 2 ∂z ψ .  (1) 
The  ﬂow  can  be  split  into  a  large  scale  component,  and  a  small  scale  component: 
q  =  q¯ + q �  and  u  =  u¯ + u� ,  where  X¯ represents  the  average  value  of  X  over  the 
averaging  scale,  and X �  =  0. 

q = �2ψ + 

(a)  Write  an  equation  for  the  time-evolution  of  ¯q .  Identify  the  term  through which 
the  small-scale  dynamics  inﬂuences  the  large  scale  vorticity.  Write  this  term  as 
the  divergence  of  a  ﬂux. 
(b)  Similarly  write	 an  equation  for  q � ,  multiply  this  equation  by  q �  and  average 
to  obtain  an  equation  for  the  small  scale  enstrophy  q �2 .  Identify  the  terms 
responsible  for  small  scale  enstrophy  production,  dissipation  and  transport. 

(c)  In	 the  enstrophy  cascade  region  of  quasi-geostrophic  turbulence  characteris­
tics  of  the  ﬂow  depend  only  on  χ,  the  enstrophy  dissipation  rate,  and  k ,  the 
wavenumber.  Express  the  turbulent  eddy  diﬀusivity  κT  in  terms  of  χ  and  k . 

(d)  Write down  an  expression parameterizing  the ﬂux  term  in  (a)  in  terms  of diﬀu­
sion  down  a  largescale  gradient,  with  the  eddy  diﬀusivity  κT  . 

(e)  Now  assume  a  balance  between  production  and  dissipation  of  enstrophy,  using 
the relevant terms derived in (b), to express κT  in terms of χ and the large-scale 
gradients. 

(f )  Eliminate χ between the expressions derived  in (c) and (d) to obtain an expres­
sion  for  the  eddy  diﬀusivity  in  terms  of  large-scale  gradients,  and  a  lengthscale 
l = k−1 . 

Problem  2.  Rotational  constraints  on  3D  turbulence 

Over  most  of  the  ocean  N/f  >  1,  so  that  turbulence  is  more  likely  to  be  inﬂuenced 
by  stratiﬁcation  than  by  rotation.  However,  in  regions  where  N  ≈  0,  such  as  the 
surface  mixed  layer,  rotation  may  constrain  unstratiﬁed  turbulence.  Assuming  that 
rotation constrains the turbulent motions when the Rossby number U /f L < 1, where 
U  is  the  velocity  scale,  and  L  the  length  scale,  ﬁnd  the  length  scale  �  above  which

rotation  aﬀects  the  turbulence.  Assume  for  l < �  the  turbulent  motions  are  in  the 
inertial  range  of  the  Kolmogorov  spectrum. 

Problem  3.  Triad  interactions  in  two  dimensions. 

Consider  the  forced  barotropic  vorticity  equation, 
u = (−∂y ψ , ∂xψ),
∂tq + u · �q − ν�2 q = F eik·x  + c.c., 
� 
withe  F  2  a  complex  random  function  of  time.  Examine  a  triad  of  waves 
q ≈ 
qj (t)e ik·x , 
j=1,2,3 

k1  + k2  + k3  = 0, 

q = �2ψ + β y ,  (2) 

(3) 

and  derive  the  equation  for  ∂tqj . 

(a)  Show  that  interactions  among  the  triad  conserve  energy  and  enstrophy  in  the 
absence  of  dissipation  and  forcing. 

(b)  Use  a  similar  approach  to  derive  the  equations  for  the  energy  and  enstrophy 
in  the  presence  of  the  forcing  and  dissipation.  If  the  forcing  is  on  the  smallest 
or  largest  wavenumber,  prove  that  the  others  will  have  zero  amplitude  in  the 
statistically  steady  state.
