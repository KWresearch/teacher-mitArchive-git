Homework  assignment  2 

Problem  1 

Let  v  be  a  Gaussian  variable.  First  show  that  all  odd  moments  of  v  are  zero.  Then 
show  that  all  even  moments  are  related  to  the  variance  σ 2  =  � (v − �v�)2  �  and  write 
what  is  the  relationship.  In  particular  write  the  skewness  and  the  kurtosis  of  a 
Gaussian  variable. 

Problem  2 

The  logistic  map  presents  the  same  closure  problem  encountered  in  turbulence.  The 
equation for any moment of x depends on higher order moments and cannot be solved 
without additional information on these higher order moments.  Consider for example 
the  equation  for  the  ensemble  average  of  x, 
x¯n+1  = r x¯n  − rxn
2 , 
where  the  overbar  denotes  the  ensemble  average.  The  equation  for  the  ﬁrst moment, 
x¯,  depends  on  the  second  moment  x2 .  Derive  the  equation  for  the  second  moment 
and  shows  that  it  depends  on moments  higher  than  second.

Most methods of  closing  the hierarchy of moments make assumptions about  the  rela­
tionship of (n + 1)-th order moments to n-th order moments.  A typical approach is to 
assume that the statistics of x are Gaussian and use the results of problem 1 to relate 
all  moments  to  the  second.  Apply  this  method  to  close  the  equation  for  the  second 
moment.  With  this  assumption,  the  equation  for  the  ﬁrst  and  second  moment  form 
a  closed  set.  Use  MATLAB  to  iterate  the  two  equations  for  r  =  4.  What  happens? 
Can you explain why this approach  fails  [Hint:  you might want to go back to Lecture 
2  and  remind  yourself  of  what  is  the  stationary  distribution  for  the  logistic map]?
