Chapter  15 

Transformed  Eulerian  Mean 

In  the  last  few  lectures we  introduced  some  fundamental  ideas on 1)  the properties of 
turbulent ﬂows in rotating stratiﬁed environments, like the ocean and the atmosphere, 
and  2)  on  the  transport  of  tracers  by  turbulent  eddies.  The  goal  of  this  chapter  is  to 
bring  together  these  two bodies of  literature  to  study  the  interaction of eddy motions 
with  a  large  scale mean  ﬂow  in  geophysically  relevant  problems. 

We  will  consider  eddies  generated  through  instabilities  of  a  zonal  mean  jet  in  the 
quasi-geostrophic  approximation  as  a  toy model.  This  is  a  very  special  example,  but 
it  is  a  useful  and  simple  testbed  to  develop  our  intuition  about  these  problems. 

The  literature  on  eddy mean-slows  interactions  is  so  vast  that  it  is  impossible  to  give 
a  comprehensive  review  in one  lecture.  Thus we will  focus a  few aspects of particular 
relevance  in  the  atmospheric  and  oceanic  context.  Our  goal  is  to  show  how  these 
theories can be used  to derive closure  schemes  to  represent  the eﬀect of eddy motions 
on  mean  ﬂows.  More  information  on  these  problems  can  be  found  in  the  references 
given  at  the  end  of  the  chapter. 

15.1  The quasi-geostrophic  equations  on  a  β -plane 

Consider  a  ﬂow  in  a  Boussinesq  ﬂuid  with  characteristic  horizontal  length  scale  L, 
velocity  U ,  time  scale  T  ≥  L/U ,  on  a  β -plane  for  which  the  Coriolis  parameter  is 
f  = f0  + β y .  We make  the  assumption  that, 

1.  the  Rossby  number  Ro = U /f0L  is  small, 
2.  the  β -eﬀect  is  small,  βL/f0  ≤ Ro, 

1 

3.  the  isopycnal  slopes  |∂x b|/|∂z b| and  |∂y b|/|∂z b| are ≤ Ro  (otherwise vertical mo­
tions  would  not  be  small), 

4.  the  static  stability N 2  = ∂ b/∂ z  is  a  function  of  z  only. 

Under these assumptions, the leading order equations in Ro give geostrophic balance. 
Thus  we  can  write  the  leading  order  geostrophic  velocities  in  the  Ro  expansion,  as, 
∂ψ 
u = −

(15.3) 

At  the  next  order  in  Ro,  we  obtain  the  prognostic  quasi-geostrophic  equations, 
Dg u − β yv − f0va  = Gx , 
Dg v + β yu + f0ua  = Gy , 
∂xua  + ∂y va  + ∂zwa  = 0, 
Dg b + N 2 wa  = B , 

(15.4) 
(15.5) 
(15.6) 
(15.7) 
(15.8) 

where Dg  is  the  time  derivative  following  the  geostrophic motions, 

Dg  = ∂t  + u∂x  + v∂y , 

(15.9) 

(ua , va , wa )  is  the  ageostrophic  velocity,  i.e  the  diﬀerence  between  the  actual  velocity 
and  the  geostrophic  one,  (Gx , Gy )  is  the  external  forcing  on  momentum  (e.g.  wind 
stress,  friction,  ...),  and  B  are  the  nonconservative  buoyancy  forces  (e.g.  small  scale 
mixing,  sea-surface  heat  ﬂuxes,  ...). 

Using  (15.4)  through  (15.7),  we  can  derive  the  equation  for  the  quasi-geostrophic 
potential  vorticity  (QGPV),  q , 

where, 

Dg q = χ, 

q = f0  + β y + ∂xv − ∂y u + f0∂z (b/N 2 ), 
χ = ∂xGy  − ∂y Gx  + f0∂z (B/N 2 ).

(15.12) 

Eq. (15.10) tells us that for conservative ﬂows (G  = 0, B = 0) q  is conserved following 
the geostrophic ﬂow.  When the ﬂow is not conservative, χ represents the local sources 
and  sinks  of  q ,  arising  from  viscous  and  diabatic  eﬀects.  As  you  can  see,  the  QGPV 
satisfy  the advection-diﬀusion equation of a generic  tracer.  Thus we might be able  to 
use  the  results  on  tracer  transport  in  turbulent  ﬂows  to  study  the  dynamics  of  q . 

15.2	 Potential  vorticity  ﬂuxes  and  the  Eliassen-
Palm  Theorem 

The  next  three  sections,  up  to  the  deﬁnition  of  Transformed  Eulerian  Mean,  follow 
very  closely  the  notes  of  Alan  Plumb  on  eddy-mean  ﬂows  interactions.  If  you  are 
interested  in  learning more on this topic,  I encourage you to contact Alan and ask  for 
a  copy  of  his  notes.

F  is  known  as  the  Eliassen-Palm  ﬂux.  Note  that  the  northward  component  of  F  is 
minus  the  northward  ﬂux  of  zonal  momentum  by  the  eddies,  u�v � ,  while  the  vertical 
component  is  proportional  to  the  northward  ﬂux  of  buoyancy,  v � b� . 

Linearizing  the  quasi-geostrophic  potential  vorticity  equation  (15.10),  we  get, 
∂tq �  + ¯u∂xq �  + v �∂y q¯ = χ� .

(15.19) 

This equation is the basic ingredient for the  Eliassen-Palm theorem:  For waves which 
are  steady  (∂tq �2  = 0),  of  smal l  amplitude,  and  conservative  (v �χ�  = 0),  the  northward 
eddy  PV  ﬂux  vanishes  (v �q �  = 0)  and  the  ﬂux  F  is  nondivergent. 

We  can  now  consider  the  problem  of  how  eddies  impact  the  zonal  mean  circulation. 
The mean  quasi-geostrophic  PV  budget  reads, 
(v �q � ) =  ¯	
χ.

(15.20) 

∂tq¯ + ∂y

Because of  the quasi-geostrophic approximation,  eq.  (15.20)  contains no mean advec­
tion  term  and  no  vertical  component  of  eddy  ﬂuxes. 

The inﬂuence of the eddies on the mean QGPV, therefore,  is entirely described by the 
northward  ﬂux  v �q � .  Now we  know  from  the Eliassen-Palm  theorem  that  if  the waves 
are 1)  steady,  2) conservative,  and 3) of  small amplitude,  then F  is nondivergent and 
v �q �  =  0.  Under  these  conditions,  therefore,  the  equation  for  the  zonally-averaged 
QGPV  is  independent  of  the  eddies.  An  therefore  the  full  evolution  of  the mean  ﬂow 
is  independent  of  the  eddies.  This  is  known  as  the  non-acceleration  theorem. 

15.3	 Mean momentum and buoyancy budgets:  con­
ventional  approach 

In  order  to  fully  appreciate  the meaning  of  the Eliassen-Palm  theorem,  it  is  useful  to 
consider the zonal mean of the quasi-geostrophic momentum and buoyancy equations, 
∂tu¯ − f0v¯a  = G¯ x  − ∂y (u�v � ), 
f0∂z u¯ = −∂y b,	
¯
∂y v¯a  + ∂zw¯a  = 0,	
B − ∂y
∂t ¯b + w¯a N 2  = ¯ 

(15.21) 
(15.22) 
(15.23) 
(15.24) 

(v � b� ). 	

The evolution of the zonal mean state in the presence of eddies is therefore manifested 
in  two  terms  –  the  convergence  of  the  eddy  ﬂux  of  momentum,  u�v � ,  and  buoyancy, 
v � b� .  Both  these  terms  force  the mean ﬂow  equations  and  it  is  important  to note  that 
the  whole  system  is  coupled,  i.e.,  the  buoyancy  ﬂuxes  can  impact  on  the  mean  ﬂow, 
just  as  much  as  the  momentum  ﬂuxes.  Thermal  wind  balance  (15.22)  links  the  two. 
Consider,  for  example,  a  wave  with  v � b�  =  0,  but  u�v �  =  0  (as  it  is  largely  true  in 

4 

�
the  ocean).  The  mean  state  cannot  respond  with  a  changing  mean  buoyancy  only; 
thermal  wind  balance  demands  a  corresponding  change  in  u¯.  From  eq.  (15.21),  this 
can  only  be  achieved  through  an  ageostrophic  meridional  circulation,  which  would 
impact  on  both  the  momentum  and  buoyancy  budgets.  Thus,  the  eddies  will  not 
¯
only drive ∂tu¯ and ∂tb, but also  ¯va  and w¯a  (except  in the unlikely case where the eddy 
forcing  terms  conspire  not  to  disturb  the  thermal  wind  balance). 

Note that the central role of the potential vorticity ﬂux, obvious in the QGPV budget, 
is not  at  all  obvious here.  Indeed, we have  seen  from  the potential  enstrophy budget, 
¯
that,  under  non-acceleration  conditions,  ∂tu¯ and  ∂tb  must  be  zero.  What  must,  and 
thus  happen,  under  such  circumstances,  is  that  eddies  induce  an  ageostrophic  mean 
motion,  which  exactly  balance  the  eddy  ﬂux  terms  in  (15.21)  and  (15.24),  i.e.  eddy 
ﬂuxes  induce a mean  circulation.  This  is  reminiscent  to  the  result  that  eddy ﬂuxes of 
quasi-conserved  tracers  can  have  an  advective  component:  in  this  problem  the mean 
advective  eﬀect  of  the  eddy  ﬂuxes  is  represented  by  the  ageostrophic  circulation. 

15.4  The  Transformed  Eulerian  Mean  Theory 

The diﬃculty in interpreting the balance of eddy terms and ageostrophic motions can 
be  overcome  by what may  seem  a mathematical  trick,  but  is  in  fact  linked  to  the  de­
composition of eddy ﬂuxes in skew (advective) and symmetric (diﬀusive) components. 
The  trick  is  to  redeﬁne  the mean meridional,  ageostrophic,  circulation. 

Consider the mean buoyancy budget (15.24).  This is (apart for the loss of some terms 
through the quasi-geostrophic assumption) the same as the Eulerian mean budget of a 
tracer equation.  We saw that the eddy ﬂux term can include an advective component. 
Under  quasi-geostrophic  assumptions,  we  can  guess  what  that  component  is. 

We  begin  by  noting  that,  from  eq.  (15.23),  we  may  deﬁne  an  ageostrophic  mean 
streamfunction  χa ,  such  that, 
(¯va , w¯a ) = (−∂z χa , ∂y χa ). 
�

We  can  then  rewrite  the mean  buoyancy  budget  in  (15.24)  as,

where  we  used  the  fact  that  N 2  =  N 2 (z ),  i.e.  the  vertical  stratiﬁcation  does  not 
change  with  latitude.  In  this  form,  it  is  quite  clear  that  the  eddy  ﬂux  term  can  be 
represented  as  a  mean  advection,  by  deﬁning  an  eddy  induced  mean  streamfunction 
χc  as,

χc  =

We  now  deﬁne  the  “residual  circulation”  as, 
(¯v † , w¯ † ) = (−∂z χ† , ∂y χ† ), 	

where  the  new  streamfunction  is, 

(15.28) 

χ†  = χa  + χc .	
(15.29) 
The  streamfunction  χ†  is  the  so-called  residual  streamfunction  and  it  represents  the 
new deﬁnition of mean circulation.  It is called a residual circulation, because in many 
situations  χa  and  χc  tend  to  oppose  each  other,  and  χ†  is  the  residual  between  two 
strong  circulations.  If we  substitute  the deﬁnition  in  (15.27)  into  the mean buoyancy 
budget,  we  obtain, 
∂t ¯b + w†N 2  = B¯ .	

(15.30) 

. 

We thus succeeded in deriving a mean buoyancy equation in which there is no explicit 
eddy term; buoyancy is transported solely through the mean vertical residual motion. 
It might be thought, of course, that the eddy terms are still there,  implicit in w† .  But 
this was also  true of wa  which, as noted earlier,  is  in general  inﬂuenced by  the eddies. 
What  we  have  done,  is  to  redeﬁne  this  inﬂuence,  so  as  to  put  the  mean  buoyancy 
budget  into  its  simplest  possible  form. 

We  can  complete  the  transformed  system  of  equations, 
∂tu¯ − f0v¯†  = G¯ x  + � · F , 
f0∂z u¯ = −∂y b,	
¯
∂y v¯†  + ∂zw¯ †  = 0,	
∂t ¯b + w¯ † N 2  = B¯ ,	

where  F  is  the  Eliassen-Palm  ﬂux. 

(15.31) 
(15.32) 
(15.33) 
(15.34) 

This  transformation  makes  the  role  of  eddies  look  quite  diﬀerent–even  though  the 
physics  described  by  equations  (15.31)  through  (15.34)  is  the  same  described  by 
(15.21)  through  (15.24). 	 The  main  advantage  is  that  in  terms  of  v¯† ,  w¯ † ,  ∂tu¯,  and 
¯∂tb,  the only term representing the eddy  forcing  is � · F  = v �q � .  This eddy  forcing ap­
pears as an eﬀective body force in the mean momentum equation.  It is clear therefore 
that, under non-acceleration conditions (when � · F  = 0 and the boundary conditions 
are  independent  of  eddy  dependent  terms),  ¯v † ,  w¯ † ,  ∂tu¯,  and  ∂t ¯b,  are  independent  of 
the  eddies. 

When  non-acceleration  conditions  are  not  satisﬁed,  the  transformed  equations  oﬀer 
a more  transparent  approach  to  the  eddy-mean  ﬂow  interaction  problem,  simply  be­
cause  the  single  term  represented  by  the  eﬀective  force  � · F  entirely  describes  the 

6


eddy  forcing  of  the mean  state.  In  fact,  this  formulation  gives  us  another  interpreta­
tion  of  F ,  as  an  eddy  ﬂux  of  transformed  negative  (easterly)  momentum,  which  is  a 
more  reliable measure  of  eddy  transport  of momentum  than  u�v �  itself. 

The interpretation of F  as a momentum ﬂux may seem to be a result of mathematical 
tinkering.  However,  it  should be  remembered  that  the process of  taking a mean  is an 
arbitrary  one–there  is  no  unique  way  of  doing  it.  Thus,  it  is  legitimate  to  choose  the 
deﬁnition  of  mean  that  simpliﬁes  the  most  the  problem  at  hand.  The  Transformed 
Eulerian  Mean  equations  indeed  give  us  a  clearer  picture  on  what  is  going  on  when 
eddies  interact  with  a mean  ﬂow. 

15.4.1  The  QGPV  ﬂux  and  the  residual  Ertel  PV  ﬂux 

The ma jor  advantage  of  the  transformed Eulerian Mean  formulation  is  that  the  only 
eddy  forcing  is the QGPV ﬂux.  We will now show that the QGPV ﬂux  is the residual 
component  of  the  full  Ertel  PV  ﬂux  and  can  thus  be  expected  to  be  diﬀusive. 

The  full  Ertel  potential  vorticity  in  the  quasi-geostrophic  approximation  is  given  by 
P  = f N 2  + f bz  + ζN 2 .  The  eddy  PV  ﬂux  can  be  computed  easily,

z  + u�ζ � , 
z  + v �ζ �  j + O(Ro2 ). 
f v � b�

(15.35) 
(15.36) 

Thus  to  leading  order  the  eddy  PV  ﬂux  has  only  an  horizontal  component.  It  is 
instructive  to  write  the meridonal  ﬂux  in  the  form,

In this form we see that the Ertel PV ﬂux is composed of an advective skew component 
and  a  residual  component,  which  happens  to  be  proportional  to  the  QGPV.  In  the 
lecture on passive  tracer  transport we  emphasized  that  the  residual ﬂux  tends  to mix 
across  tracer  contours,  while  the  skew  component  does  not  mix.  Furthermore  the 
skew  component  is  typically  much  larger  than  the  residual  component.  Similarly  in 
this  problem,  the  skew  component  advects  PV  around  and  dominates  the  full  PV 
ﬂux,  but  it  is  the  residual  ﬂux  that  achieves  mixing.  This  can  be  demonstrated  by 
considering  the QGPV  variance  budget, 
∂tq �2  + ∂y v �q �2  = −2v �q �q¯y  + 2D.	

(15.43) 

this  suggests  that  in  steady  state  for  homogeneous  turbulence,  the  eddy  QGPV  ﬂux 
must  be  down  its mean  gradient, 

v �q �  = −K q¯y .	

(15.44) 

15.5	 Parameterizing  mesoscale  motions  in  numer­
ical  models 

So far we avoided getting our hands dirty to ﬁnd closures that relate the eddy ﬂuxes to 
the mean ﬂow.  The TEM  formalism  is however often  invoked to derive parameteriza­
tions of the  interaction between  large-scale mean ﬂows and small-scale transient eddy 
motions.  In  this  section,  we will  use  the  results  of TEM  together with  some  physical 
insight to derive sets of equations where the eddy terms do not appear explicitly.  Two 
approaches  are  used  in  the  literature,  one  based  on  an  energetic  argument,  and  the 
other  on  potential  vorticity mixing  theory. 

15.5.1	 The  energetic  argument 

The  energetic argument has been used  to derive  eddy parameterizations  in  the ocean 
only.  Thus  we  will  restrict  our  scope  to  ocean  dynamics  in  this  section. 

Although mesoscale  eddy motions  can  be  directly  generated  by  external  forcing,  like 
the  wind  ﬁeld,  most  of  the  mesoscale  eddy  energy  is  believed  to  be  the  result  of 
instabilities  in  many  forms  (Pedlosky,  1987).  The  common  belief  is  that  eddies  are 
generated by extracting kinetic and potential energy  from  the mean ﬂow.  This might 

8


not be  the whole  story  though:  in  two dimensional and quasi-geostrophic  turbulence, 
eddy  motions  can  create  an  inverse  energy  cascade  and  return  some  of  the  energy 
back  to  the  mean  ﬂow.  The  point  here  is  that  an  analysis  of  the  exchange  of  energy 
between mean  and  eddy motions might  be  fruitful  to  derive  parameterizations. 

The  total  mechanical  energy  is  given  by  the  sum  of  the  kinetic  K  and  potential 
energies  P ,  which  in  the  geostrophic  approximation  are,

Exchange  of  energy  between  eddies  and  a  zonal  ﬂow  may  be  deﬁned  following  the 
separation  of  the  zonally  averaged  kinetic  and  potential  energies  into  components 
associated with the eddy and mean motions.  In the quasi-geostrophic approximation, 
this  is  straightforward,

The eddy terms on the rhs represent conversion of mean energy  into turbulent energy

The  ocean  is  a  strongly  stratiﬁed  ﬂuid  and  most  of  the  energy  in  the  basic  state 
is  stored  as  potential  energy  due  to  tilted  isopycnal  surfaces.  This  energy  is  con­
verted  into  mesoscale  eddy  motions  mainly  through  baroclinic  instabilities.  Thus 
in  equation  (15.48)  the  buoyancy  eddy  ﬂux  terms  typically  dominate  over  the  eddy 
momentum  ﬂux  terms. 

The  divergent  terms  represent  transport  of  eddy  activity  from  one  region  to  another. 
In  a  statistically  steady  state,  we  can  assume  that  there  is  no  net  transport  of  mean 
mechanical  energy  out  of  the  domain  considered.  Neglecting  the  kinetic  energy  loss 
terms  and  the  divergent  terms,  we  have  that  on  average,

Baroclinic  instability  tends  to  extract  potential  energy  from  the  mean  state.  The 
simplest  closure  that  would  ensure  that  energy  is  always  released  from  the  mean 
state  and  lost  into  the  eddy  ﬁled  is, 
v � b�  = −K ∂y b.

This  closure  scheme  was  ﬁrst  proposed  by  Gent  and  McWilliams  in  1990,  and  it  is 
now  in  use  in most  coarse-resolution  ocean models. 

In terms of the TEM, this closure provide an estimate of the eddy induced circulation,

The  parameterization  of  Gent  and  McWilliams  is  thus  equivalent  to  assuming  that 
the  eddy  induced  circulation  is  proportional  to  the  isopycnal  slope.  As  long  as mean 
isopycnals  are  tilted,  there  is  available  potential  energy  to  drive  an  eddy-induced 
circulation. 

In  terms  of  the  Transformed  eulerian  mean  formalism  the  parameterization  of  Gent

and McWilliams  is  as  a  closure  for  the  eddy  forcing  of  the  residual  circulation,  i.e.,

In  this  closure  the  eddy  stress  is  proportional  to  the  isopycnal  slope.  In  order  to 
satisfy  conservation  of  mean  momentum,  it  is  customary  to  impose  K  =  0  at  the 
ocean  surface  and  ocean  bottom.

15.5.2  The  potential  vorticity  mixing  argument 

We  have  shown  that  in  steady  state  for  homogeneous  turbulence,  the  eddy  QGPV 
ﬂux must  be  down  its mean  gradient, 
v �q �  = −K q¯y .

This  expression  for  the  eddy  forcing  of  the  residual  circulation  diﬀers  from  that 
in  (15.52).  The  two  expressions  are  equivalent  if  1)  K  is  constant,  2)  there  is  no

planetary  PV  gradient  (β  =  0),  and  3)  PV  is  dominated  by  the  baroclinic  term. 
In  the  ocean  condition  3  is  often  satisﬁed.  Condition  2  is  harder  to  assess,  because 
it  depends  on  whether  eddies  mix  on  distances  large  enough  to  feel  the  eﬀect  of  β . 
Condition  1  instead  cannot  be  satisﬁed,  because  one  needs  to  impose  K  =  0  at  the 
boundaries in the Gent-McWilliams parameterization and therefore K  cannot be con­
stant.  Thus the two closure schemes are diﬀerent.  It is open to debate which approach 
is  more  appropriate.  A  good  discussion  can  be  found  in  the  paper  by  Treguier  et  al. 
(1997).
