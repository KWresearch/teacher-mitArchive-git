Statistical  closures  for  isotropic 
homogeneous  3D  turbulence 

8.0.1  Parameterizations  in  the  absence  of  a  mean  ﬂow 

Statistical closures constitute an intriguing alternative to conventional numerical sim­
ulations  of  the  primitive  dynamical  equations  of  turbulence.  The NavierStokes  equa­
tion  at  high  Reynolds  number,  for  example,  deﬁes  direct  numerical  computation, 
primarily  because  the  solutions  of  this  strongly  nonlinear  equation  vary  rapidly  in 
both  space  and  time.  In  contrast,  statistical  closures  provide  approximate  descrip­
tions of the average behavior of an ensemble of turbulent realizations;  these statistical 
solutions  are  relatively  smooth. 

The  construction  of  a  statistical  description  of  turbulence  is  far  from  unambiguous. 
The  averaging  of  a nonlinear  equation  leads  to  an  inﬁnite  hierarchy  of moment  equa­
tions that is usually closed by adopting some approximate relation between high-order 
moments  and  low-order moments.  We  illustrate  as  an  example  the

∂ t

where  uˆi  = ˆu(ki , t)  is  one  component  of  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  velocity  ﬁeld. 
For  simplicity  we  will  consider  only  one  component  of  the  velocity  ﬁeld  and  we  will 
forget  about  the  fact  that  the  Fourier  components  are  complex. 

The  approach  that  we  will  take  is  to  derive  equations  for  the  energy,  i.e.  the  sec­
ond  order  moment,  and  use  a  quasi-normal  approximation  to  infer  the  relationship 
between  higher  order  moments  and  energy.  This  closure  scheme  is  referred  to  as  an

book  for  a  presentation  of  the  EDQN  closure. 

8.0.2  Parameterizations  in  the  presence  of  a  mean  ﬂow 

In geophysical ﬂows,  it  is typically  the case that  there  is some  large scale ﬂows driven 
by  external  forcing  applied  either  at  the  boundaries  or  in  the  interior.  Turbulence 
however appears at small scale as ”noise” superimposed on the mean ﬂow.  Recall that 
we  can  separate  the  eﬀects  of  mean  and  turbulence  by  taking  a  Reynolds  average  of

where  as  usual,  the  primes  denote  departure  from  the  average.  Notice  that  we  are 
using  an  overbar  to  denote  averages,  because  in  this  case  the  averages  are  not  neces­
sarily  ensemble  averages.  In  this  section we  associate  the  average  ﬂow with  the  large 
scale motion and  the primed ﬂow with the smaller  scales.  This constitutes  our deﬁni­
tion  of  average,  if  you  like.  Somewhat  inconsistently  we  assumed  that  the  averaging 
(cid:1) 
operator  satisﬁes  the  all  the  usual  properties  for  ensemble  averages,  like  u¯iu
j  = 0. 

For the case of turbulence superimposed on a mean ﬂow, the closure problem amounts

(cid:1) 
(cid:1) 
to  ﬁnding  a  way  to  express  the  the Reynolds  stresses  u
j ui  in  terms  of  resolved  quan­
tities  ( ¯ui ).  This  is  a  very  diﬀerent  question  from  that  considered  above,  when  we 
considered  the case of predicting  the evolution of turbulence  in the absence of a mean 
ﬂow.  Both  questions  are  very  interesting,  but  in  most  geophysical  applications  the 
problem  in  the  presence  of  a mean  ﬂow  is  more  relevant. 

Before  we  proceed  to  derive  a  closure  scheme,  we  want  to  build  some  intuition  on 
the  eﬀect  of  turbulence  on  the  mean  ﬂow.  We  follow  an  argument  given  by  Salmon 
in  chapter  3  of  his  book.  Insight  can  be  gained  considering  the  energy  budget  for 
the  mean  ﬂow.  To  form  an  equation  for  the  energy  in  the  large  scale  motions,  we 
multiply  (6.2) by ui  and  integrate over  the whole  ﬂuid.  After  integration by  parts we

is  the  rate  at  which  large-scale  energy  is  being  converted  to  small-scale  energy  by 
the  advection  terms  in  the  momentum  equations.  To  show  this,  you  can  form  an 
equation  for  the  rate  of  change  of  energy  in  small  spatial  scales;  you  would  ﬁnd  that 
the  term  (6.5)  appears  with  the  opposite  sign.  Now  we  want  to  show  that  C  is  typ­
ical ly  positive  in  three  dimensional  turbulence.  The  word  typically  is  a  remainder 
that  all  such  statements  are  statements  about  statistical  averages,  and  rest  on  as­
sumptions  about  average  behavior.  Three  dimensional  turbulence  is  predictable  only 
in  a  statistical  sense  and  closures  can  be  derived  only  for  the  average  behavior,  not 
for  individual  realizations. 

Now  consider  the  situation where  the  large  scale  ﬂow  is  given  by  a  time  independent 
shear  ﬂow  of  the  form,

Vortex  stretching  is  the  primary  mechanism  for  energy  transfer  between  diﬀerent 
scales  in  three  dimensional  turbulence.  Let  us  assume  the  small-scale  turbulence  as 
an initially isotropic collection of vortex tubes.  Tube A is stretched by the mean shear, 
and  the magnitude  of  its  vorticity  therefore  increases.  On  the other  hand,  the  vortex 
tube  C  is  squashed,  and  the  magnitude  of  its  vorticity  decreases.  Tube  B  remains 
unstretched.  At  a  later  time,  cortex  tube  A  becomes  the  dominant  contribution  to 
the  Reynolds  stress,  and  it  contributes  negatively  to  u(cid:1)v (cid:1) .  The  Reynolds  momentum 
ﬂux  is  down-gradients  and  C  is  positive.  Small-scale  three  dimensional  turbulence 
tends  to  slow  down  the  large-scale  ﬂow. 

The  simplest  closure  scheme  that  captures  the  property  that  C  is  positive  deﬁnite

This  is  a  ﬁrst  order  closure.  Models  vary  in  the  complexity  of  the  system  used 
to  specify  νT ,  the  eddy  viscosity.  νT  can  be  speciﬁed  directly  in  terms  of  the  large-
scale  quantities  of  the  ﬂow  and/or  model  grid,  or  it  can  be  speciﬁed  in  terms  of 
subgridscale  quantities  for which  extra  prognostic  equations  are  required.  Most  eddy 
viscosity  models  draw  on  Prandtl’s mixing  length  model.

Mixing  length  model 

The  diﬃculty  with  pursuing  a  vorticity  based  argument  is  that  it  does  not  provide 
any  guidance  on  how  to  pick  the  eﬀective  diﬀusivity.  Prandtly  proposed  therefore  a 
diﬀerent  argument  to  give  a  scaling  for  νT .

Consider  a  parcel  in  the  shear  ﬂow  introduced  above,  ( ¯u(y ), 0, 0).  Assume  that  the 
parcel was initially at at some position y .  If the parcel moves due to turbulent motion, 
up  to  a position  y + δy , and  it  conserves momentum,  then  it has a momentum  deﬁcit 
compared  to  the  parcels  around  it  of,

in  order  to  neglect  higher  order  terms  in  the  Taylor  series  expansion.  If  we  further 
assume  that  the  statistics  of  turbulent  ﬂuctuations  are  homogeneous  and  isotropic,

νT  = c l

Under  the  isotropy  assumption  δv 2  = δu2  = δw2 , we  can  write  this  as

νT  = cµ  l

where q/2 is the small-scale turbulent kinetic energy, TKE, and cµ  is again a constant.

q ,  and  a  single  lengthscale  l. 
motion  is  characterized  by  a  single  velocity  scale 

The  problem  of  estimating  νT  is  now  reduced  to  one  of  estimating  the  TKE  and  the 
mixing  length  l.  An  expression  for  νT  can  be  obtained  by  assuming  that  the  small-
scale  motions  satisfy  the  Kolmogorov  inertial  range  scaling,  E (k) ∼  2/3 k−5/3 . Then

we  can  estimate  q  as, 
q ∼

νT  = cµ

(8.18) 

(8.19) 

Hence  we  have  two  equivalent  representations  of  νT  in  terms  of  turbulent  quantities: 
eq.(6.16)  and  eq.(6.19).  One  or  the  other  of  these  representations  for  νT  form  the 
basis  of many  eddy  viscosity  models.  We  still  need  to  know  either  q  and  l  or  q  and   
to  have  a  full  closure. 

Notice  that  if  q  and  l  change  in  space,  it  seems  that we  have  to abandon  the assump­
tion  that  the  turbulence  is  homogeneous.  But  homogeneity  is  at  the  core  of  eddy 
mixing length arguments. A way out of this apparent inconsistency is to assume that 
turbulence  is  homogeneous  on  scales  smaller  than  the  model  grid  size  and  thus  we 
can apply mixing  length theory.  However  variations  in turbulent  levels  appear on the 
much  larger scales  explicitly  resolved  by the model and this  is why we need equations 
for  q  and  l  or  q  and  . 

A  second  issue  of  concern  is  that  eddy  mixing  length  theory  should  not  be  used  for 
non-conserved  quantities.  If  we  assume  that  the  average  is  carried  on  distances  so 
short  that  pressure  eﬀects  do  not  change  momentum  much,  then  we  can  apply  eddy 
mixing  length  theory  to  momentum.  However  this  is  often  done  for  models  whose 
resolution  is  too  coarse  for  this  to  be  true.  The  only  rationale  to  use  a  large  eﬀective 
viscosity  in these cases is numerical:  without a large νT  coarse resolution models tend 
to  be  unstable. 

Smagorinsky  model 

Smagorinsky  proposed  a  simple  argument  to  determine  the  eddy  viscosity  without 
having  to  derive  separate  equations  for  q ,  l, or  .  The  argument  goes  as  follows.  We 
start  by  assuming  a  local  production/dissipation  balance  for  the  TKE,

where  the  new mixing  length  is  given  by, 

3/4 l. 
lm  = cµ 

Now  we  just  need  to  decide  on  what  is  an  appropriate  estimate  for  lm ,  the  mixing 
length.  In  the  Smagorinsky  model,  lm  is  assumed  to  be  proportional  to  the  largest 
length  scale  of  the  unresolved  motion,  i.e.  the  grid  scale  ∆x  in  a  numerical  model.

Then  from  eq.(6.24)  we  have, 
νT  = CS ∆x 2  2Sij
2 . 

(8.26) 

The  value  of  the  constant  CS  is  chosen  by  assuming  that  the  cutoﬀ  wavenumber 
kC  = π/∆x  lies within  a  k−5/3  inertial  range  of  a Kolmogorov-type  energy  spectrum. 
Therefore  the  transfer  through  the  cut  (also  called  the  subgrid  drain  or  subgrid  dis­
sipation)  is,

discretization  used.  Lilly  (1967)  suggests  it  as  the  ‘largest  wavenumber  unambigu­
ously  representable  on  a ﬁnite  diﬀerence mesh’.  Since  changing  the  coeﬃcient  simply 
alters  the  Smagorinsky  constant  in  a  corresponding manner,  we  shall  not  discuss  the

It  is  useful  here,  since  the  Smagorinsky  model  is  widely  used  in  oceanography,  to 
remind  ourselves  of  the  assumptions  we  have  used  to  get  here.  We  have  assumed, 

6 

1.  A local balance between shear production and dissipation of subgridscale kinetic 
energy,  i.e.  ignoring  buoyant  production  and  transport  of  TKE. 

2.  A  single  characteristic  lengthscale  ∆x. 

3.  ∆x is within an inertial range appropriate to isotropic homogeneous turbulence. 

These  assumptions  will  be  most  clearly  violated  when  the  model  resolution  is  so 
coarse  that  the  inertial  range  is  not  even  partially  resolved,  when  there  are  strong 
inhomogeneities  in  the  turbulence,  so  that  transport  of  TKE  is  important,  when  the 
subgridscale turbulence  cannot be characterized as isotropic homogeneous turbulence 
(i.e.  stratiﬁcation  and  rotation  are  important)  and  when  buoyancy  is  important  in 
generating  or  removing  TKE.  Because  this  model  is  not  appropriate  when  buoyancy 
is  important  on  the  subgrid  scales,  it  is  typically  only  used  in  coarser  resolution 
ocean models  for  the  horizontal  components  of  viscosity  and  diﬀusivity.  If  the model 
resolution  is  ﬁner,  so  that  buoyancy  production  of  kinetic  energy  is  resolved  (i.e.  an 
LES model),  it might  be  justiﬁed  to  assume  a balance  between  shear  production  and 
dissipation  for  the  smaller  subgrid  scales,  and  hence  use  the  Smagorinsky  model  for 
vertical  diﬀusivities/viscosities  too.
