Particle  Dispersion 

Random   F l i g h t   - L a g r a n g i a n   d i s p e r s i o n  

As  a n   exanlple,  we  examine  t h e   randoin  flight  model.  which  assumes  t h a t   t h e   accel- 
era t ions  have  a  stochastic  component  and   use  Newton's equations 

d X  = V d t  
d V  = A d t  + P d R  

where  A  is  t h e  acceleration  produced  by  deterministic  (or large-scale)  forces.  We  include 
randoin  accelerations with  t h e   random   increment  d R  satisfying  ( d R i  d R j )  = G i j d t .  
As  examples, consider  a  d rag  law  for  t h e   acceleration 

with  u  being  t h e   water  velocity.  The   dispersion  is  determined  by  P  and   T ;   from  t h e  
equations:  we  can  show  t h a t  

The  l a t t e r  corresponds  t o  a  diffusivity  of  r ;   = p 2 / 2 r 2 .  

Area  grows  like  4 ~ t
 
( 6 r ; t  in  3-D) 
Velocity variance  is  TK

Taylor  dispersion 

In   1922 ,   Taylor  described  t h e   dispersion  under  t h e   assumption  t h a t   t h e   Lagrangian 
velocity  had   a  known  covariance  s t ruc tu re .   He  considered just 

We  find  t h a t  

and ,  in  the   ensemble  average, 

- X , X j   = K X j  + x,y

If  we  sub s t i tu te  

X  = Xo + 6 V ( t l ) d t '  
t 
and   look  a t  t h e   case where  ( V )  = 0  and   t h e   flow  is  statioilary, we  have 

where  R&  is  t h e  covariance  of  t h e  Lagrangian  velocities 

For  isotropic  motions  R L . ( t )  = U 2 R L ( t ) b i j  w i th  R L ( t )  being  t h e   autocorrelation  function; 
t h e  change  in  x-variance %J. is  given by 

From  th i s   formulal we  see  t h a t  

For  shor t   times, 
( x 2 )  = U 2 t 2  
For  long  times,  if  t h e   integral T int = Jr R L ( t ) d t  is finite  a n d  non-zero, 

Relation  to  diffiisivity 

Consider  t h e  diffusion  of  a  passive  scalar 

and   define moments of  t h e  d is tr ibu t ion  

In tegra t ing  t h e  diffusion equation  gives  conservation  of  t h e   t o t a l  scalar:  under  t h e  assum- 
t ion   t h a t   t h e   in i t ia l  d is tr ibu t ion   is  compact  a n d  t h e  values  decay  rapidly  a t   infinity 

The  first  moment  gives 

so t h a t   &(z) = 0.  (Th is  result  would  be  different  if  there   were  flow  as well.) 

The   second  inonlent 

implies  t h a t  

3 -(z 2 ) = 2 t i  
at 
Thus  we  can  identify  t h e  effective diffusivity 

Small  amplitude motions 

If  we  assume  t h a t   t h e   scale  of  a  typical  particle  excursion  over  t ime   Tint is  small 
compared t o  t h e  scale over which t h e  flow variesl we  can relate t h e  Lagrangian and  Eulerian 
s ta t is t ics .   The  displacement  ti  = X i ( t )  - X i ( 0 )  satisfies 

and  we  can  sub s t i tu te   t h e   lowest  order  solution 

into  t h e   second  t e rm   above  t o  write 

and   average,  recognizing  t h a t   t h e  mean  Lagrangian  velocity  is just  ( g ~ i ) :  

For  simplicity, we  assuine  t h a t   t h e   turbu len t   velocities  are   large  coinpared  t o   t h e   inean; 
then   th i s  becomes

Let  us  assuine  t h a t   t h e   integrals  with  respect  t o  r  exist  and   split  t h e   covariance  in to

We  can  write  a n  a rb i t ra ry   ailtisymmetric tensor  in ter ins  of  t h e  un i t   ailtisymmetric tensor 

so t h a t   the   con tr ibu t ion  t o  t h e  Lagrangian  velocity  is

Note  t h a t   t h e  antisymmetric  p a r t   of  t h e  contribution  t o  t h e  Lagrangian  velocity  is  nondi- 
vergent: 

Thus   t h e   Lagrangian mean   velocity  has  ~ o n t ~ r i b u t i o n s  from t h e  mean   Eulerian  flow,  from 
t h e   Stokes' dr if t ,   and   a  t e rm  which  tends   t o  move  into  regions  of  higher  diffusivity 

We  will  discuss  t h e  meanings  of  these  te rm s   in  more  de ta i l  next.

Thus   particles  simply  move  along  t h e   streamlines.  At  some  Lagrangian  period  T L ,  t h e  
particle  will  have  moved  one  period  t o  t h e   left  so  t h a t  

Stokes drifts occur when  t h e  Lagrangian period  differs from t h e  Eulerian period.  Trapped

When  we  have  a  non-zero,  t h e   tra jec tor ies   become  less  regular  in  t h e   vicinity  of  t h e  
s tagna t ion  points.  A  line  of  particles  approaching t h e  point  begins  t o  fold, with  soine fluid 
crossing in to  t h e  interior a n d  soine being ejected.  Which way  a  parcel goes depends on  t h e  
phase  of  t h e  per turb ing   wave  as  it  nears  t h e  s tagna t ion  point.

The  inixing across  t h e  channel is s t i l l  blocked  for  a  small enough  < 0.05 so t h e  inixing

W i t h   th i s   form, we  can  see  t h a t   t h e   Stokes' drift  does  not  a l ter   tracer   variance  (or max-

In   add i t ion ,  we  no te  t h a t   for  variable  K ,  t h e   center  of  mass  of  t h e   tracer   satsfies 

so  t h a t   t h e   center  of  mass  of  t h e   tracer   (for  narrow  d is tr ibu t ions)   indeed  moves  with  t h e

Conclusions: 
R.ossby  waves  cause  mean   westward  dr if ts   a t   t h e   edges  and   eastward  dr if ts   in  t h e  
center. 
Eddy   diffusivities  are  spatially  variable  and   anisotropic.
