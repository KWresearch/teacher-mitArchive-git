Isotropic  homogeneous  3D 
turbulence 

Turbulence  was  recognized  as  a  distinct  ﬂuid  behavior  by  Leonardo  da  Vinci  more 
than 500 years ago.  It  is Leonardo who termed such motions ”turbolenze”, and hence 
the  origin  of  our  modern  word  for  this  type  of  ﬂuid  ﬂow.  But  it  wasn’t  until  the  be­
ginning of  last century  that  researchers were  able to develop  a  rigorous mathematical 
treatment  of  turbulence.  The  ﬁrst  ma jor  step  was  taken  by  G.  I.  Taylor  during  the 
1930s.  Taylor  introduced  formal  statistical  methods  involving  correlations,  Fourier 
transforms  and  power  spectra  into  the  turbulence  literature.  In  a  paper  published  in 
1935  in  the  Proceedings  of  the  Royal  Society  of  London,  he  very  explicitly  presents 
the  assumption  that  turbulence  is  a  random  phenomenon  and  then  proceeds  to  in­
troduce  statistical  tools  for  the  analysis  of  homogeneous,  isotropic  turbulence.  In 
1941  the  Russian  statistician  A.  N.  Kolmogorov  published  three  papers  (in  Russian) 
that provide  some of the most  important and most-often quoted  results of turbulence 
theory.  These  results,  which  will  be  discussed  in  some  detail  later,  comprise  what  is 
now  referred  to  as  the  K41  theory,  and  represent  a  ma jor  success  of  the  statistical 
theories of turbulence.  This theory provides a prediction for the energy spectrum of a 
3D  isotropic  homogeneous  turbulent  ﬂow.  Kolmogorov  proved  that  even  though  the 
velocity  of  an  isotropic  homogeneous  turbulent  ﬂow  ﬂuctuates  in  an  unpredictable 
fashion,  the  energy  spectrum  (how  much  kinetic  energy  is  present  on  average  at  a 
particular  scale)  is  predictable. 

The spectral theory of Kolmogorov had a profound impact on the ﬁeld and it still rep­
resents  the  foundation  of many  theories  of  turbulence.  It  it  thus  appropriate  to  start 
this  course  by  introducing  the  concepts  of  3D  isotropic  homogeneous  turbulence  and 
K41.  It  should  however  be  kept  in  mind  that  3D  isotropic  homogeneous  turbulence 
is  an  idealization  never  encountered  in  nature.  The  challenge  is  then  to  understand 
what  aspects  of  these  theories  apply  to  natural  ﬂows  and what  are  pathological.

A  turbulent  ﬂow  is  said  to  be  isotropic  if, 

•  rotation  and  buoyancy  are  not  important  and  can  be  neglected, 
•  there  is  no  mean  ﬂow. 

Rotation  and  buoyancy  forces  tend  to  suppress  vertical  motions,  as  we  discuss  later 
in  the  course,  and create an anisotropy between  the vertical  and  the horizontal direc­
tions.  The  presence  of  a  mean  ﬂow  with  a  particular  orientation  can  also  introduce 
anisotropies  in  the  turbulent  velocity  and  pressure  ﬁelds. 

A  ﬂow  is  said  to  be  homogeneous  if, 

•  there  are  no  spatial  gradients  in  any  averaged  quantity. 

This  is  equivalent  to  assume  that  the  statistics  of  the  turbulent  ﬂow  is not  a  function 
of  space.  An  example  of  3D  isotropic  homogeneous  ﬂow  is  shown  in  Fig.  6.1.

This  equation  state  that  the  rate  of  change  of  turbulent  kinetic  energy  E  (TKE) 
is  balanced  by  viscous  dissipation  .  Such  a  balance  cannot  be  sustained  for  long 
times  - a  source  of  kinetic  energy  is  needed.  However  sources  of  TKE  are  typically 
not  homogeneous:  think  of  a  stirrer  or  an  oscillating  boundary.  We  sidestep  this 
contradiction  by  assuming  that  for  large  Reynolds  numbers,  although  isotropy  and 
homogeneity are violated by  the mechanism  producing  the turbulence,  they  still hold 
at  small  scales  and  away  from  boundaries.  Then  the  turbulence  production  can  be 
represented  simply  by  a  forcing  term  F ,  assumed  to  be  isotropic  and  homogeneous:

6.1  Kinetic  Energy  Spectra  for  3D  turbulence 

Deﬁnition  of  KE  in  spectral  space 

For a ﬂow which is homogeneous in space (i.e.  statistical properties are independent of 
position), a spectral description is very appropriate, allowing us to examine properties 
as  a  function  of  wavelength.  The  total  kinetic  energy  can  be  written  replacing  the

Ri,j (r)  tells  us  how  velocities  at  points  separated  by  a  vector  r  are  related.  If  we

spectrum  has  the  information  content  of  the  two-point  correlation. 

E (k)  contains  directional  information.  More  usually,  we  want  to  know  the  energy  at

Energy  budget  equation  in  spectral  space 

We have an equation for the evolution of the total kinetic energy E .  Equally  interest­
ing  is  the  evolution  of E (k),  the  isotropic  energy  at  a particular wavenumber  k . This 
will  include  terms  which  describe  the  transfer  of  energy  from  one  scale  to  another, 
via  nonlinear  interactions.

φi,i (k, t) = φi,i (k, 0)e 

(6.21) 

According  to  (6.21),  the  energy  in  wavenumber  k  decays  exponentially,  at  a  rate 
that  increases  with  increasing  wavenumber  magnitude  k .  Thus  viscosity  damps  the 
smallest  spatial  scale  fastest. 

We now restrict our analysis  to  isotropic velocity ﬁelds,  so that we can use (6.10) and 
simplify  (6.19), 
E (k , t) = T (k , t) − 2ν k2E (k , t),

Hence the nonlinear interactions transfer energy between diﬀerent wave numbers, but 
do  not  change  the  total  energy. 

Now,  adding  a  forcing  term  to  the  energy  equation  in  k -space  we  have  the  following 
equation  for  energy  at  a  particular  wavenumber  k ,

If the forcing F (k)  is concentrated on a narrow spectral band centered  around a wave

2ν k2E (k) = T (k). 
(6.31) 
In  the  limit  of  ν → 0,  the  energy  dissipation  becomes  negligible  at  large  scales.  Thus 
there must  be an  intermediate  range of  scales  between  the  forcing  scale  and  the  scale 
where  viscous  dissipation  becomes  important,  where, 
2ν k2E (k) = T (k) ≈ 0.

Notice  that   must  remain  nonzero,  for  nonzero  F (k),  in  order  to  balance  the  energy

Then  we  ﬁnd  the  energy  ﬂux  in  the  limit  ν → 0, 

(6.32) 

Π(k) = 0,  :  k < ki 
Π(k) =   :  k > ki 

(6.33) 

Hence  at  vanishing  viscosity,  the  kinetic  energy  ﬂux  is  constant  and  equal  to  the  in­
jection rate, for wavenumbers greater than the injection wavenumber ki .  The scenario 
is as  follows.  (a) Energy  is  input at a rate  at a wavenumber  ki .  (b) Energy  is ﬂuxed 
to higher wavenumbers  at  a  rate    trough  triad  interactions.  (c) Energy  is  eventually 
dissipated  at  very  high  wavenumbers  at  a  rate  ,  even  in  the  limit  of  ν → 0. 

The  statement  that  triad  interactions  produce  a  ﬁnite  energy  ﬂux    toward  small 
scales  does  not  mean  that  all  triad  interactions  transfer  energy  exclusively  toward 
small  scales.  Triad  interactions  transfer  large  amounts  of  energy  toward  both  large 
and  small  scales.  On  average,  however,  there  is  an  excess  of  energy  transfer  toward 
small  scales  given  by  . 

Kolmogorov  spectrum 

Kolmogorov’s 1941 theory  for the energy spectrum makes use of the  result  that , the 
energy  injection  rate,  and  dissipation  rate  also  controls  the  ﬂux  of  energy.  Energy 
ﬂux  is  independent  of wavenumber  k ,  and equal  to    for k > ki .  Kolmogorov’s  theory 
assumes  the  injection  wavenumber  is  much  less  than  the  dissipation  wavenumber 
(ki  <<  kd ,  or  large  Re).  In  the  intermediate  range  of  scales  ki  < k < kd  neither  the 

7


forcing  nor  the  viscosity  are  explicitly  important,  but  instead  the  energy  ﬂux    and 
the  local  wavenumber  k  are  the  only  controlling  parameters.  Then  we  can  express 
the  energy  density  as 

E (k) = f (, k) 

(6.34) 

Now  using  dimensional  analysis:

anced  by  2/3  because  k  has  no  time  dependence.  Thus, 

E (k) = 2/3 g (k). 

(6.35) 

Now  g (k) must  have  dimensions  L5/3  and  the  functional  dependence  we  must  have, 
if  the  assumptions  hold,  is, 
−5/3 

E (k) = CK 2/3 k
This  is the famous Kolmogorov  spectrum, one of the cornerstone of turbulence theory. 
CK  is  a  universal  constant,  the  Kolmogorov  constant,  experimentally  found  to  be 
approximately  1.5.  The  region  of  parameter  space  in  k  where  the  energy  spectrum 
−5/3  form is known as the inertial range.  In this range, energy cascades 
follows this k
from  the  larger  scales  where  it  was  injected  ultimately  to  the  dissipation  scale.  The 
theory  assumes  that  the  spectrum  at  any  particular  k  depends  only  on  spectrally 
local  quantities  - i.e.  has  no  dependence  on  ki  for  example.  Hence  the  possibility  for 
long-range  interactions  is  ignored. 

(6.36) 

We  can  also  derive  the  Kolmogorov  spectrum  in  a  perhaps  more  physical  way  (after 
Obukhov).  Deﬁne  an  eddy  turnover  time  τ (k) at  wavenumber  k  as  the time taken 
for  a  parcel  with  energy  E (k) to  move  a  distance  1/k . If  τ (k)  depends  only  on  E (k)

Kolmogorov  scale 

We  have  shown  that  viscous  dissipation  acts  most  eﬃciently  at  small  scales.  Thus 
above a certain wavenumber  kd , viscosity will become  important, and E (k) will decay 
more rapidly than in the inertial range.  The regime k > kd  is known as the dissipation 
range.  A  simple  scaling  argument  for kd  can be made by assuming  that  the spectrum 
follows the inertial scaling until kd  and then drops suddenly to zero because of viscous 
dissipation.  In  reality  the  transition  between  the  two  regimes  is  more  gradual,  but 
this  simple  model  predicts  kd  quite  accurately.  First  we  assume,

a  range  of  scales  growing  as  the  (3/4)th  power  of  the  integral  Reynolds  number.  It 
follows  that  if  we  want  to  describe  such  a  ﬂow  accurately  in  a  numerical  simulation

3D  homogeneous  isotropic  turbulence  in  geophysical 
ﬂows 

The assumptions of homogeneity, stationarity and isotropy as employed by Taylor and 
Kolmogorov have permitted tremendous advances in our understanding of turbulence. 
In  particular  the  theory  of  Kolmogorov  remains  an  outstanding  example  of  what  we 
mean  by  emergence  of  statistical  predictability  in  a  chaotic  system.  However  this  a  a 
course  on  geophysical  turbulence  and  we  must  ultimately  confront  the  fact  that  real 
world  physical  ﬂows  rarely  conform  to  our  simplifying  assumptions.  In  geophysical 
turbulence,  statistical  symmetries  are  upset  by  a  complex  interplay  of  eﬀects.  Here 
we focus on three important class of phenomena that modify small-scale turbulence in 
the  atmosphere  and  ocean:  large-scale  shear,  stratiﬁcation,  and  boundary  proximity. 
In  a  few  weeks  we  will  consider  the  role  of  rotation. 

A very nice description of the eﬀect of shear, stratiﬁcation, and boundary proximity on 
small-scale  geophysical  turbulence  is  given  in  the  review  article  on  ”3D  Turbulence” 
by  Smyth  and  Moum  included  as  part  of  the  reading  material.  The  student  should 
read  that  paper  before  proceeding  with  this  chapter.  Here  we  only  provide  some 
additional  comments  on  the  deﬁnition  of  the  Ozimdov  scale. 

Ozmidov  scale 

In geophysical ﬂows 3D turbulence  can be a reasonable approximation at scales  small 
enough  that  buoyancy  and  rotation  eﬀects  can  be  neglected.  Stratiﬁcation  becomes 
important at scales smaller than rotation and it is therefore more important in setting 
the  upper  scales  at  which  3D  arguments  hold.  Stratiﬁcation  aﬀects  turbulence  when 
the  Froude  number  F r  =  U/(N H )  <  1,  where  U  is  a  typical  velocity  scale,  and  H 
a  typical  vertical  length  scale  of  the  motion.  For  large  F r ,  the  kinetic  energy  of  the 
motion  is  much  larger  than  the  potential  energy  changes  involved  in making  vertical 
excursions  of order H .  For  small F r ,  the  stratiﬁcation suppresses  the vertical motion 
because a substantial  fraction of kinetic energy must be converted  to potential energy 
when  a  parcel moves  in  the  vertical. 

We  can  deﬁne  a  characteristic  scale  lB  at  which  overturning  is  suppressed  by  the 
buoyancy  stratiﬁcation  as  follows.  The  velocity  associated  with  a  particular  length 
scale  l  in  high  Reynolds  number  isotropic  3D  turbulence  scales  like, 
u ∼ (l)1/3 .	
⇐⇒ 
u 2  ∼ 2/3 k
−2/3 

(6.52) 

Vertical  motion  at  length  scale  l  will  be  suppressed  by  the  stratiﬁcation  when  the 
local Froude  number  F rl  = 1.  If  we  deﬁne  the  length  scale  at  which  this  suppression

occurs  as  lB  then,

where  lB  is  known  as  the  Ozmidov  scale. 

In  stratiﬁed  geophysical  ﬂows, we have a  scenario  in which  a  regime  transition occurs 
at  lB . 
•	 l < lB :  Fully  3D,  isotropic  turbulence.  In  this  regime  stratiﬁcation  can  be 
neglected,  and  an  inertial  range may  exist,  if  ld  << lB ,  i.e.  /(νN 2 ) >> 1. 
•	 l > lB :  Stratiﬁcation  inﬂuenced  regime.  In  this  regime    is  no  longer  constant 
with  wave  number,  since  some  kinetic  energy  is  lost  through  conversion  to  po­
tential energy.  3D turbulence  is  replaced by motion controlled by  the buoyancy 
stratiﬁcation:  either  internal  waves,  or  a  quasi-2-dimensional  turbulence,  often 
described  as  “pancake  turbulence”,  characterized  by  strong  vortical motions  in 
decoupled  horizontal  layers.
