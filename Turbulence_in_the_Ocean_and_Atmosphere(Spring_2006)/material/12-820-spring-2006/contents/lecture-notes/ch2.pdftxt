From  laminar  to  turbulent  ﬂows 

Turbulent  ﬂows  can  often  be  observed  to  arise  from  laminar  ﬂows  as  the  Reynolds 
number is increased1 .  The transition to tubulence happens because small disturbances 
to the ﬂow are no longer damped by the ﬂow, but begin to grow by taking energy from 
the  original  laminar  ﬂow.  This  natural  process  is  easily  visualized  by  watching  the 
simple  stream  of water  from  a  faucet  (or  even  a  pitcher).  Turn  the  ﬂow  on  very  slow 
(or  pour)  so  the  stream  is  very  smooth  initially,  at  least  near  the  outlet.  Now  slowly 
open the  faucet (or pour  faster) and observe what happens, ﬁrst  far away,  then closer 
to  the  spout.  The  surface  begins  to  exhibit  waves  or  ripples  which  appear  to  grow 
downstream.  In  fact,  they  are  growing  by  extracting  energy  from  the  primary  ﬂow. 
Eventually  they  grow  enough  that  the  ﬂow  breaks  into  drops.  These  are  capillary 
instabilities  arising  from  surface  tension,  but  regardless  of  the  type  of  instability,  the 
idea  is  the  same  –inﬁnitesimal  disturbances  have  grown  to  disrupt  the  simplicity  of 
the  laminar  ﬂow.  In  this  lecture  we  investigate  how  this  transition  from  laminar  to 
turbulent  dynamics  occurs. 

Laminar  ﬂows  are  solutions  of  the  Navier-Stokes  equations  in  the  limit  when  nonlin­
earities  can  be  neglected.  This  situation  corresponds  to  the  Stokes  approximation; 
the ﬂow  is given by a balance between external  forcing (mechanical or thermodynam­
ical)  and  dissipation.  The  corresponding  velocity  ﬁeld  is  entirely  predictable  and  has 
the  same  regularity  properties  as  the  applied  external  forces. 

As  the  Reynolds  number  is  increased,  nonlinearities  are  no  longer  negligible.  There 
is  a  critical  Reynolds  number,  above  which  the  system  bifurcates  toward  completely 
new  solutions.  These  solutions  correspond  to  breaking  of  symmetries  of  the  origi­
nal  ﬂow.  For  example  a  steady  ﬂow  submitted  to  time  independent  forcing  becomes 
time periodic.  Usually  the  state  resulting  from  a ﬁrst bifurcation  is  still very  regular. 

1 In  this  lecture  Reynolds  number  is  used  to  identify  whatever  nondimensional  number  is  appro­
priate  to  characterize  the  onset  of  turbulence  in  the  problem  at  hand.

When the Reynolds number  is  increased even further, the ﬂow that emerged after the 
primary  bifurcation  can  itself  become  unstable  to  new  modes  breaking  new  symme­
tries.  The  set  of  bifurcation  continues  until  the  global  dynamics  of  the  ﬂow  becomes 
very  complicated,  i.e.  turbulent. 

The  transition  from  simple  to  complex  behavior  is  observed  in  models  as  simple  as 
deterministic maps.  Thus  in  the  next  section we  derive  a map  based  on  a  loose  anal­
ogy  to  the  Navier-Stokes  equation.  A  study  of  solutions  of  the  map  will  provide  an 
introduction  to  the  problem  of  the  onset  of  complexity  and  chaos  in  simple  deter­
ministic  systems.  These  results  will  provide  an  introduction  to  the  problem  of  onset 
of  turbulence.  How  can  irregular  and  apparently  stochastic  solutions  appear  in  ﬂuid 
ﬂows  that  are  governed  by  deterministic  equations? 

2.1	 The logistic map as a poor man’s Navier-Stokes 
equation 

Following  Frisch  we  introduce  a  discrete  map  that  mimics  some  of  the  properties  of 
the  Navier-Stokes  equations.  A  sort  of  a  poor  man’s  Navier-Stokes  equation.  We 
begin  with  the  incompressible  form  of  the  NavierStokes  equations, 
ut  + u · �u = −�p + Re−1�2 
u + F ,	
� · u = 0.	

(2.1) 
(2.2) 

� 
We  now  express  the  sloutions  in  terms  of  the  Fourier  representation  of  u, 
ai (t)e ik·x .	
i 

u(x, t) = 

(2.3) 

This resulting inﬁnite system of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) for the Fourier 
� 
coeﬃcients  is  known  as  a Galerkin  pro jection  of  the  Navier-Stokes  equations;  e.g., 
a˙ i  = −  Aij k aj ak  − Re−1 |k|2 ai  + Fi . 
j k 

(2.4) 

Equation  (2.4)  is  simple  to  understand.  Every  mode  ai  represents  a  component  of 
the  velocity  ﬁeld  with  a  lengthscale  |k|.  The  velocity  ﬁeld  at  each  lengthscale  can 
be  changed  through  nonlinear  interaction with  other modes,  through  linear  damping 
or  through  forcing  Fi .  The  nonlinear  interaction  are  quadratic  and  their  strength  is 
controlled  by  the  coeﬃcients  Aij k .  Damping  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  length-
scale  and  thus  it  is  more  eﬃcient  for  small-scale  modes.  A  detailed  derivation  of 
equation  (2.4)  is  given  in  chapter  3  of  Salmon’s  book. 

In  order  to  keep  the  problem  simple  let  us  remove  all  but  a  single  arbitrary  wave 
mode.  This  procedure  is  called  a Galerkin  truncation.  This  results  in  an  equation  of 

2


the  form,


a˙ = −Aa2  − Re−1 |k|2 a, 

(2.5) 

i.e.  an evolution equation for one mode forced by a quadratic nonlinearity and damp­
ing.  This derivation  is not  formally correct.  A careful expansion of  the Navier-Stokes 
equation  would  show  that  a  mode  cannot  interact  nonlinearly  with  itself.  In  other 
words  Aiii  =  0.  We  ignore  the  issue  for  the  moment.  The  only  justiﬁcation  for 
equation  (2.5)  is  that  it  has  a  quadratic  nonlinearity  and  dissipation,  much  alike 
the  Navier-Stokes  equation  and  it  might  be  a  useful  paradigm  to  study  the  onset  of 
complex  behavior  in  a  simple  deterministic  system. 

It  is  straightforward  to  solve  (2.5) numerically.  Here we will employ a  simple  forward 
Euler  single-step,  explicit  time  integration  procedure.  This  leads  to, 
− an  = −Aa2 
n  − Re−1 |k|2 an , 
an+1 
τ 

(2.6) 

where τ  is an arbitrary discrete  time  step parameter.  We now  rearrange  the equation 
� 
� 
as, 
1 − Re−1τ |k|2  − an 
. 
τ A 

an+1  = τ Aan 

(2.7) 

which  implies  that, 

This map  can  be  reduced  to  a  well  studied  example,  if  we  require, 
1 − Re−1τ |k|2 
= 1, 
τ A 
� 
� 
τ A = 1 − Re−1τ |k|2  . 
� 
� 
This  in  turn  permits  us  to  write  (2.6)  as, 
an+1  = 4  1 − Re−1τ |k|2  an (1 − an ) = ran (1 − an ), 

(2.8) 

(2.9) 

(2.10) 

which  is  the  well  known  logistic map. 
It  is  easily  seen  that  as  Re → ∞,  r 
→
1  from  below.  Since  a(1 − a)  has  a maximum 
at  1/4  for a ∈  [0.1] we  see  that we  should  rescale  r  by  a  factor  of  4  to  obtain  that  the 
range  of  values  for  r  is  is between  zero  and  four,  just  as  in  the  logistic map.  It  is  also 
worth  observing  that  r  depends  on  the  wavevector magnitude,  and  on  the  numerical 
time  step  parameter.  In  particular,  we  see  that  the  product  of  these  factors must  be 
less than Re in order for r > 0 to hold.  This implies that as the wavevector magnitude 
increases, the time step size must decrease, just as would certainly be the case in order 
to maintain  stability  of  an  explicit  time-stepping method  such  as  forward  Euler.

We will show that the logistic map displays broadband spectrum in time, nonlinearity, 
unpredictable behavior, and time reversibility.  However it is derived assuming a single 
lengthscale and  it cannot display any spatial structure.  Thus the  logistic map  is poor 
man’s Navier-Stokes equation and cannot display turbulent behavior.  However  it  is a 
useful  tool  to  study how a deterministic  system can produce chaos and unpredictable 
behavior. 

2.1.1  Linear  solutions  of  the  logistic  map 

We  start  by  studying  linear  solutions  of  the  logistic map.  The  variable  an  represents 
the  amplitude  of  the  velocity  at  time  nτ .  For  convenience  we  will  now  switch  from 
an  to xn  to  indicate  the mode  amplitude.  The  logistic map  is  a  one  dimensional map 
of  the  form  xn+1  = F (xn ), 

xn+1  = rxn (1 − xn ). 
The  iteration  of  one dimensional maps  is  easy  to  see  graphically:  if we plot  y = F (x) 
and  y = x,  the  iterations  are  given  by  successive  steps  between  these  two  curves, 

(2.11) 

y = F (xn ),

xn=1  = y . 

(2.12) 

Successive  iterations  from  a  given  initial  values  are  given  by  successive  operations  of 
the map  F ,  an  operation  known  as  functional  composition, 

x1  =  F (x0 ), 
x2  =  F (x1 ) = F (F (x0 )), 
. . . 
xn  =  F (xn−1 ) = F (F  . . . F (x0 )). 

(2.13) 
(2.14) 

(2.15) 
(2.16) 

We  use  the  matlab  function  cobweb.m  to  study  the  properties  of  the  map.  The 
intersection  xf  of  y = F (x)  with  y = x  is  a  ﬁxed  point  of  the  iteration,  if, 

F (xf ) = xf . 

(2.17) 

We  can  easily  answer  the  question  of  whether  an  initial  condition  close  to  xf  ap­
proaches  the  ﬁxed  point  under  iteration  (when  we  call  the  ﬁxed  point  stable)  or 
moves  away  from  it  (unstable  ﬁxed  point)  by  linearizing  the  evolution  about  xf  : 
write x = xf  + δx and  then using a Taylor  expansion with F � (x)  the derivative of  the 
function, 

xn+1  = xf  + δxn+1  = F (xf  + δxn ) ≈ F (xf ) + δxnF � (xf ) 

so  that 

δxn+1  = F � (xf )δxn 

4 

(2.18) 

(2.19) 

and  |δxn |  will  increase  on  successive  iterations  for  F � (xf ) >  1.  Thus  the  ﬁxed  point 
is  stable  for  F � (xf )  <  1  and  is  unstable  for  F � (xf )  >  1.  This  procedure  is  the  map 
equivalent  of  the  linear  stability  analysis  of  solutions  of  the Navier-Stokes  equations. 
In  12.803  we  considered  the  linear  stability  analysis  of  shear  ﬂows.  In  that  case  we 
considered  the  stability  as  a  function  of  external  parameters  like  the  shear  and  its 
curvature.  Here  we  will  study  the  stability  of  ﬁxed  points  for  diﬀerent  Reynolds 
numbers. 

2.1.2  Bifurcations  and  the  onset  of  chaos  in  the  logistic  map 

In  the  logistic  map  for  small  values  of  r  there  is  only  one  stable  ﬁxed  point  xf  and 
almost  all  initial  conditions  lead  to  an  orbit  that  converges  to  the  ﬁxed  point  (x = 0 
and  x  =  1  being  exceptional  initial  conditions).  These  solutions  correspond  to  the 
laminar  ﬂows  at  small  Reynolds  numbers.  Nonlinearities  are  subdominant.  However 
things  change  as  we  increase  r.  What  happens  when  xf  becomes  unstable  (which 
happens  at  r = 3)? 

The  ﬁrst  bifurcation 

As  the map  parameter  r  is  changed,  the  character  of  the  long  time  solution  dramat­
ically  changes,  from  a  ﬁxed  point  to  a  time  dependent  solution.  These  changes  are 
called bifurcations.  For values of r  slightly  larger  then 3,  the  solution converges  to an 
orbit which alternately visits two values x1  and x2 :  this  is the discrete time version of 
a  limit  cycle  or  periodic  orbit  (here  period  two).  The  second  iterate  function  y = F 2 
yields  three  intersections  with  the  line  y  =  x.  It  is  easy  to  check  that  at  two  of 
these  the magnitude  of  the  slope  |dF 2/dx|  is  less  than  unity,  i.e.  there  are  two  stable 
ﬁxed  points  of  F 2 ,  and  these  correspond  to  x1  and  x2 .  The  third  ﬁxed  point  of  F 2  is 
unstable:  xf  is  of  course  an unstable ﬁxed point  of F .  These  issues  are  illustrated by 
the matlab  functions  cobweb.m  and  logistic  fp.m.  Try  to  run  them  using  r = 3.2. 

The  second  bifurcation 

Set  r  to  r  = 3.5  and  look  at  the  iterations  of  F .  The  period  two  orbit  has  gone 
unstable,  and  the  tra jectory  converges  to  a  period  four  orbit.  We  have  seen  that  the 
period  two  orbit  is  simple  (a  ﬁxed  point!)  in  F 2 .  We  can  understand  the  second 
bifurcation by studying the ﬁxed points of F 4 .  The  instability of the period two orbit 
is  seen  to  be  associated  with  the  slope  of  F 4  becoming  greater  than  unity,  and  again 
two  new  ﬁxed  points  of  F 4  develop. 

Further  bifurcations 

The  analysis  of  bifurcations  gets  more  and  more  awkward  as  r  increases.  Hence  we 
switch to numberical exploration.  But keep in mind that numerics can ﬁnd attractors 

5


but  miss  the  unstable  structures.  With  r  slightly  bigger  than  3.54,  the  population 
will  oscillate  between  8  values,  then  16,  32,  etc.  The  lengths  of  the  parameter  inter­
vals  which  yield  the  same  number  of  oscillations  decrease  rapidly;  the  ratio  between 
the  lengths  of  two  successive  such  bifurcation  intervals  approaches  the  Feigenbaum 
constant, 
rn  − rn−1  = 4.669 . . . 
δ =  lim 
n→∞  rn+1  − rn 
All  of  these  behaviors  do  not  depend  on  the  initial  population.  This  is  the  so-called 
period-doubling  bifurcation. 

(2.20) 

The  bifurcations  that  occur,  and  the  diﬀerent  types  of  orbits,  are  well  shown  by 
the  bifurcation  map.  This  is  constructed  with  the  parameter  r  along  the  abscissa, 
and  all  values  of  x  visited  (after  some  numbers  of  iterations  to  eliminate  transients) 
plotted  as  points  along  the  ordinate.  A  ﬁxed  point  orbit  over  a  range  of  r  appears 
as  a  single  curve,  which  splits  into  two  curves  at  the  bifurcation  to  the  period  two 
orbit  etc.  Chaotic  dynamics,  where  the  orbit  visits  an  inﬁnite  number  of  points 
(otherwise  the  orbit  would  repeat,  and  therefore  be  periodic)  appears  as  bands  of 
continua  of  points  (sub ject  to  limitations  of  how many  points  are  actually  plotted  in 
the  implementation). 

The  bifurcation  diagram  of  the  logistic  map  shows  that  simple  systems  can  have  an 
amazingly  rich  bifurcation  structure.  This  complexity  in  the  logistic  map  was  ﬁrst 
studied  by May  in  the  context  of  population  dynamics.  You  can  create  a  bifurcation 
map  with  the matlab  function  logistic  bif.m. 

The  onset  of  chaos 

At  r  = 3.569946 . . .  the  orbits  become  very  irregular  and  we  can  no  longer  see  any 
oscillations.  Slight  variations  in  the  initial  population  yield  dramatically  diﬀerent 
results  over  time.  These  are  signatures  that  the  orbits  have  become  cahotic.  Notice, 
however,  that  periodic  windows  mysteriously  appear  here  and  there  as  we  further 
increase  r .  These  are  sometimes  called  islands  of  stability.  The  largest  window  is 
near (3.8284, 3.8415) where there  is a period three orbit.  For slightly higher values of 
r oscillations ﬂicker between 6 values, then 12 etc.  There are other ranges which yield 
oscillation  between  5  values  etc.;  all  oscillation  periods  do  occur.  These  behaviours 
are  again  independent  of  the  initial  value. 

At  r  =  4,  the  large  admissible  value  for  r,  the  map  is  fully  chaotic.  The  iterations 
appear  completely  random,  and  the  values  eventually  ﬁll  up  the whole  interval  [0, 1]. 
This  chaotic  motion  can  be  completely  understood  by  making  a  transformation  of 
variables.  Deﬁne, 

xn  = sin2 (πzn/2).

a  function  of  r.  This  amazing  diagram  is  as  beautiful  as  it  is mysterious.  If  you  look 
at  it  more  closely,  you  will  ﬁnd  that  lying  just  above  the  periodic  windows  in  the 
chaotic  region are  small  copies  of  the whole orbit diagram.  Thus  this picture has ﬁne 
structures  at  arbitrarily  small  scales.

� 
The  iteration  of  z  for  r = 4  is  then  just,


zn+1  =

0 ≤ zn  ≤ 1/2 
2zn , 
1/2 ≤ zn  ≤ 1 
2 − 2zn , 
This is known as the tent map.  Successive values of zn  from a random initial value are 
as random as a coin toss (and in fact in binary representation answering the question of 
whether the n-th value is to the right or left of 0.5 just gives the binary representation 
of  the  initial  value,  which  is  random  for  a  random  initial  value).  Beyond  r  =  4,  the 
values  eventually  leave  the  interval  [0, 1]  and  diverge  for  almost  all  initial  values. 

(2.22) 

It  is  interesting  to  consider  the  temporal  spectrum  of  orbits  of  the  logistic  map  for 
diﬀerent  values  of  r .  At  the  appearance  of  the  period  two  orbit,  the  spectrum  has  a 
single  peak  at  f  = 1/2.  As  r  increases,  period  doubling  bifurcations  generate  new 
peaks  at  sub-harmonics  f /2,  f /4  and  so  on.  Notice  that  the  appearance  of  sub-
harmonics  is  quite  diﬀerent  from  the  appearance  of  super-harmonics  (2f , 4f ,  . . .) 
as  a  result  of  quadratic  nonlinearities.  Finally,  at  the  onset  of  chaos  the  number  of 
excited  harmonics  becomes  large  and  the  spectrum  appears  to  be  broadband. 

2.2  Chaos  and  sensitivity  to  initial  conditions 

The orbits of the logistic map become very erratic when r = 4.  But what do we mean 
by  the orbits being chaotic?  The onset of chaos  is deﬁned by a ”sensitive dependence 
on  initial  conditions”,  i.e.  orbits  with  similar  initial  conditions  diverge  exponentially 
fast.  The  sensitive  dependence  on  initial  conditions  can  be  made  quantitative  by 
generalizing  the  idea  of  instability  of  a  ﬁxed  point.  Equation  (2.19)  can  in  fact  be 
used  for  the  expansion  of  a  small  separation  at  any  xn , 
δxn+1  = F � (xn )δxn , 
so  that  the  product  of  the  derivatives  at  successive  iterations  gives  us  the  expansion 
(or  contraction)  of  the  separation  between  the  iterates  of  nearby  points. 

(2.23) 

More precisely we start with initial conditions x0  and x0 +Δx and ask for the distance 
between  the  n-th  iterates,  which  we  expect  to  grow  as, 
|δxn | = Δxe nλ(x0 ) , 
����� 
����� 
�����
����� 
where  λ(x0 )  is  the  so-called  Lyapunov  exponent  for  the  initial  condition  x0 ,  i.e. 
F n (x0  + Δx) − F n (x0 ) 
dF n (x0 ) 
Δx

dx0 
For  systems  like  the  logistic map  for  r = 4  the  limit  exists  and  is  independent  of  the 
initial  condition  x0  for  almost  all  initial  conditions  (e.g.  not  those  points  exactly  on

unstable  periodic  orbits),  and  will  be  denoted  λ  and  called  the  Lyapunov  exponent 
of  the map.  The derivative  can be  evaluated by  the  chain  rule  in  terms  of derivatives 
of  F  at  the  intermediate  iterations, 

dF n (x0 ) 
dx0 

= F � (xn−1 )F � (xn−2 ) . . . F � (x1 )F � (x0 ). 

(2.26) 

Thus  we  can  compactly  write, 

λ = �log |F � |�, 
(2.27) 
where  the  average  � �  is  over  the  iterations  of  the  map.  A  positive  value  of  λ  corre­
sponds to the diﬀerence between closely spaced initial conditions growing (on average 
exponentially)  with  iteration  i.e.  to  sensitive  dependence  on  initial  conditions.  Thus 
a  positive  Lyapunov  exponent  is  a  signature  of  chaos,  and may  be  used  as  a  deﬁning 
criterion.  The Lyapunov exponents of the logistic map are shown as a function of r  in 
ﬁgure  2.2.  Positive  values  of  λ  appear  forlarger  values  of  r .  The  occasional  negative 
dips  correspond  to  the  islands  of  stability.

2.3  Routes  to  chaos 

The  logistic  map  is  a  useful  example  to  study  the  onset  of  chaos  in  a  deterministic 
system  as  a  function  of  an  external  parameter  like  the  Reynolds  number  r.  The 
question arises as to whether the bifurcation patterns that  leads to the onset of chaos 
is  typical  of  other  systems,  or  whether  it  is  an  oddity  of  the  logistic  map.  For  the 
moment  we  restrict  the  discussion  to  maps  and  low  order  dynamical  systems  (i.e. 
systems  described  by  a  small  number  of  ordinary  diﬀerential  equations).  We  will 
extend  the  discussion  to  turbulent  ﬂows  at  the  end  of  the  lecture. 

Despite  the  richness  and  complexity  in  the  orbits  generated  by  maps  and  dynamical 
systems,  it  turns  out  that  the  routes  to  chaos  are  quite  universal  and  can  be  broadly 
grouped  in  three  classes:  the  period doubling  route,  the  intermittency  route,  and  the 
quasi-peridoc  route.  The  logistic  map  is  an  example  of  a  map  that  follows  the  ﬁrst 
route.

Period  doubling  route  (Feigenbaum,  1978) 

The  system  loses  stability  through  period-doubling,  pitchfork  bifurcations.  The  sys­
tem  undergoes  a  cascade  of  such  period-doublings  until  at  the  accumulation  point 
one  observes  aperiodic  behaviour,  but  no  broad-band  spectrum.  Note  also,  that  if 
one  has  seen  three  bifurcations,  a  fourth  bifurcation  becomes  more  probable  than  a 
third  after  only  two,  etc.  This  route  to  chaotic  behavior  has  been  observed  in  heat 
transport  by  convection. 

Intermittency  route  (Pomeau  &  Maneville,  1980) 

The  system  loses  stability  through  intermittency,  i.e.  chaos  appears  intermittently 
within an otherwise regular tra jectory.  There are no clear cut precursors for this route 
although  it  is  characterized  by  long  periods  of  periodic  motion  with  bursts  of  chaos. 
The  logistic map  shows  transition  to  chaos  through  intermittency  for  r = 3.8282  just 
below  the  period  three  window.  Intermittent  behavior  generally  happens  close  to  a 
saddle-node  bifurcation. 

Quasi-periodic  route  (Ruelle  &  Takens,  1971) 

In  this  route  to  chaos,  there  are  a  number  of  periodic  orbits with  irrationally  related 
frequencies  that  lead  to  chaos.  The  system  loses  stabilty  through  Hopf  bifurcations. 
Assume  that  a  system with  a  steady  state  solution  loses  its  stability,  as  some  control 
parameter  is  varied,  through  a  Hopf  bifurcation  (ie.  a  pair  of  complex  eigenvalues 
crosses  the  imaginary  axis).  The  steady  state  becomes  oscillatory.  Assume  that 
this  happens  three  times  in  succession  and  that  the  three  newly  created  modes  are 
essentially  independent  - then  chaos  may  occur.  The  precursor  is  the  existence  of 
quasi-periodic motions. 

The  power  spectrum  will  exhibit  one,  then  two,  and  possibly  three  independent  ba­
sic  frequencies.  When  the  third  frequency  is  about  to  appear  simultaneously  some 
broad-band  noise  will  appear  –  this  is  then  regarded  as  chaotic.  Evidence  is  from 
Taylor-Couette vortices in ﬂuid ﬂow between rotating cylinders and in Rayleigh-Bnard 
convection. 

2.4  A  statistical  description  of  chaos 

The  previous  examples  suggest  that  tra jectories  of  maps  and  dynamical  systems  are 
predictable  when  orbits  are  ﬁxed  points  or  periodic  oscillations.  After  the  onset  of 
chaos,  instead,  there  seem  to  be  little  hope  to  predict  the  details  of  the  tra jecto­
ries.  This  situation  is  similar  to  what  happens  in  the  study  of  ﬂuid  ﬂows.  When  the 
Reynolds  number  is  small,  solutions  are  linear  and  predictable.  At  large  Reynolds

this  is  spooky  since  the  period  three  orbit  no  longer  exists!  We  are  seeing  the  ghost

alytically,  nor  numerically.  Does  it  mean  that  a  theory  of  turbulence  is  beyond  our 
reach? 

Let  us  consider  the  logistic  map  with  r  =  4,  in  the  strongly  chaotic  regime.  The 
map displays broadband  spectrum  in  time,  nonlinearity,  unpredictable behavior,  and 
time  irreversibility  (Fig.  2.4).  However  the  histogram  of  the  positions  x  assumed  by 
the  orbit  is  quite  predictable  (Fig.  2.4).  In  the  chaotic  regime  the  histograms  show  a 
predictability  that  does  not  emerge  in  individual  tra jectories.  The  histogram  always 
converge  toward  the  same  distribution,  regardless  of  initial  conditions.  Why  does 
the  histogram  of  the  logistic  map  converge  to  a  limit  solution?  Why  a  deterministic 
system  such  as  a  map  has  a  regular  statistical  behavior?  We  do  not  have  complete 
answers  to  these  equations,  but  progress  is  being  made.  The  current  understanding 
is  that  maps  in  the  chaotic  regime  collapse  on  a  strange  attractor  which  is  a  gener­
alization  of  the  ﬁxed  points  and  periodic  orbits  in  the  linear  regime.  The  structure 
of  strange  attractors  is  very  complex.  That  is  why  tra jectories  are  so  erratic  and 
diﬃcult  to  predict.  However  ensemble  of  tra jectories  reﬂects  the  mean  structure  of 
the  attractor  and  can  be  predicted. 

In this section we derive a statistical description of the logistic map.  The goal is to un­
derstand  the  diﬀerence  between  the  tra jectory-based  description  and  the  histogram-
based description.  First we need to determine the evolution equation for the histogram 
P (v),  also  known  as  the probability distribution  function,  so  that we  can  observe  the 
recurrence  relation  Pn+1 (v) = U Pn (v).  The  distribution  function  Pn+1 (v)  after  n + 1 
iterations  is  obtained  by  the  action  of  the  operator  U  on  Pn (v),  which  is  the  distri­
bution  function  after  n  iteration  of  the  map.  The  operator  U  acts  on  functions  and 
it  is  known  as  the  Perron-Frobenius  operator. 

We  can  derive  the  Perron-Frobenius  operator  for  the  logistic  map.  We  have  already 
shown  that  by making  the  change  of  variables, 

xn  = sin2 (πzn/2),

As  a  consequence  of  the  form  of  the  Perron-Frobenius  operator,  if  Pn  is  constant 
equal  to  P0 ,  then  Pn+1  is  also  equal  to  P0 .  The  uniform  distribution  P  =  P0  is

one  obtains  by  running  numerical  integrations  of  the  tent  map.  Thus  the  statistical 
description  predicts  a  result  that  cannot  be  derived  from  simple  inspection  of  the 
deterministic  equation. 

How  do  we  know  that  the  equilibrium  distribution  is  obtained  for  any  set  of  initial 
conditions?  In  order  to  solve  arbitrary  initial  value  problems,  we  need  the  full  set  of 
eigenfunctions  and  eigenvalues  of  the  Perron-Frobenius  operator.  These  eigenfunc­
tions  can  be  used  to  represent  any  arbitrary  initial  condition.  The  eigenfunctions  for 
the tent map belong to a family of polynomials called the Bernoul li  polynomials.  The 
eigenfunctions  are  found  by  solving  the  problem, 

P (v) = λ  U P (v). 

(2.32) 

In  the  example  of  the  tent  map,  we  ﬁnd  that  the  all  eigenfunctions  but  the  uniform 
distribution  have  λ ≤ 1.  For  example  an  eigenfunction  is  given  by, 
2 
P (v) = v 2  − 2v + 
.

(2.33) 

This  eigenfunction  has  an  eigenvalues  λ  = 1/4.  The  uniform  distribution  P  = 1  is 
the  only  eigenfunction  with  eigenvalue  λ  =  1.  Thus  all  eigenfunctions  other  than 
the  uniform  distribution  decay  in  time.  And  the  uniform  distribution  emerges  as  the 
asymptotic  state. 

It  is  left  as  an  exercise  to  relate  the  probability  distribution  of  the  tent  map  to  that 
of  the  poor  man’s  Navier-Stokes  map,  and  show  that  it  correctly  predicts  what  we 
found  by  numerical  integrations  of  the map. 

2.5  Turbulence  and  chaos 

It  is  ﬁnally  time  to  go  back  to  ﬂuid  dynamics  and  try  to  relate  the  lessons  of  chaotic 
maps  to  the  description  of  turbulence. 

2.5.1  Transition  to  turbulence 

Lessons  from  the  dynamical  system  approach 

Up  to  the  discovery  of  chaos  in  simple  deterministic  systems,  studies  on  the  onset 
of  turbulence  dealt  with  linear  and,  very  rarely,  with  weakly  non-linear  evolution  of 
external disturbances.  The ﬁrst physical model of  laminar-turbulent transition  is due 
to Landau and it is reported in the fourth volume of the course on Theoretical Physics 

15


(Landau  and  Lifshitz,  1971).  According  to  this  model,  as  the  Reynolds  number  is 
increased, the system undergoes a inﬁnite series of Hopf bifurcations.  Each bifurcation 
causes the velocity ﬁeld to oscillate with a new frequency fi , until for suﬃciently large 
i the motion appears chaotic.  In this picture the unpredictability of turbulence arises 
because  each  new  frequency  fi  is  associated  with  a  new  phase  φi  and,  for  large  i,  it 
becomes  progressively  diﬃcult  to  keep  track  of  all  oscillations. 

The  Landau  transition  scenario  is,  however,  untenable  because  a  few  incommensu­
rate  frequencies  do  not  generate  positive  Lyapunov  exponents.  And  the  sensitive 
dependence  on  initial  conditions  is  a  trademark  of  turbulent  ﬂows.  This  character­
istic  feature  is  now  known  as  the  butterﬂy  eﬀect.  Thus  the  transition  to  turbulence 
is  probably  best  understood  in  terms  of  the  routes  to  chaos  observed  in  maps  and 
simple  dynamical  systems. 

Shortcomings  of  the  dynamical  system  approach 

Should  we  then  conclude  that  the  onset  of  turbulence  is  analogous  to  the  onset  of 
chaos?  Unfortunately  the  story  is  more  complicated.  Dynamical  systems  arise  from 
the pro jections of the full Navier-Stokes dynamics on a very limited number of spatial 
scales.  The  onset  of  chaos  in  those  system  is  then  forced  to  remain  conﬁned  to  few 
spatial  scales.  Experiments  suggest  that  the  onset  of  turbulence  in  real  ﬂows  is 
associated  with  broadband  spectra  both  in  time  and  in  space.  It  is  very  diﬃcult  to 
set up experiments where there  is transition to chaos with the appearance broadband 
spectrum in time, without an increase in the number of the spatial degrees of freedom. 
Only  by  carefully  designing  experiments  in  closed  environments,  can  one  observe  the 
routes to chaos described above in real ﬂows.  For the moment, we must conclude that 
the  theory  of  dynamical  systems  and  chaos  provides  useful  insights  in  the  world  of 
turbulence, but it is not the whole story.  We will return to this issue in the discussion 
of  turbulent  convection. 

2.5.2  Statistical  description  of  turbulence 

The  logistic  map  is  a  useful  tool  to  illustrate  some  important  characteristics  of  tur­
bulent  ﬂows.  However  it  is  pathological  in  at  least  two  ways, 

•	 The logistic map explores the full available space [0, 1].  Typically turbulent sys­
tems are dissipative and collapse on an attractor with  fractal structure (at  least 
for  ﬁnite-dimensional  systems).  This  limitation  can  be  overcome  considering 
two  dimensional maps. 
•	 Natural  systems  tend  to  have  more  than  one  attractor.  Thus  the  equilibrium 
statistical  properties  are  not  fully  predictable. 

16 

Furthermore  there  are  technical  issues  that  have  not  been  solved  for  the  Navier-
Stokes  equations.  We  do  not  know  if  solutions  exist  for  all  times  for  arbitrary  initial 
condition.  We  do  not  know  how  to  write  the  equivalent  of  the  Perron-Frobenius 
operator.
