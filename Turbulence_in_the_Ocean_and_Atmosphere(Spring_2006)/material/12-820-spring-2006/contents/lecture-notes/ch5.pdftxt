Above a thin boundary layer, most atmospheric 
convection involves phase change of water:
Moist Convection

Moist Convection

• Significant heating owing to phase 
changes of water
• Redistribution of water vapor – most 
important greenhouse gas
• Significant contributor to stratiform 
cloudiness – albedo and longwave 
trapping

• Supersaturations very small in atmosphere
• Drop size distribution sensitive to size 
distribution of cloud condensation nuclei

size distributions)
• Bergeron-Findeisen Process
• Strongly nonlinear function of cloud water 
concentration

s*
,
α=α( s*, p q,

We can add an arbitrary function of qt to s* such that
α≅α( s * ', p )

Precipitation Effects:

Buoyancy Reversal:

Summary of Differences Between Dry and
Moist Convection:
• Possibility of metastable states
• Strong asymmetry between cloudy and 
clear regions
• Typically, only thin layers near surface are 
unstable to upward displacements
• Mixing can cause buoyancy reversal
• Large potential for evaporatively cooled 
downdrafts
• Separation of buoyancy from displacement 
can lead to propagating convection

• Buoyancy of unsaturated downdrafts 
depends on supply of precipitation
• Entropy produced mostly through 
mixing, not dissipation
• Internal waves can co-exist with 
unstable convection
