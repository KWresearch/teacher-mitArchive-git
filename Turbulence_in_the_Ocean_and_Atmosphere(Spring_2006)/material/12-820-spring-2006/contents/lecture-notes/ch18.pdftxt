Boundary  layer  turbulence 

Turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere is strongly aﬀected by the presence of bound­
aries.  Boundaries  impose  severe modiﬁcations  to  the momentum  and  buoyancy  bud­
gets.  At  solid  boundaries,  the  boundary  condition  that  the  ﬂuid  velocity  is  zero 
applies  to  both  the mean  velocity  and  to  the  ﬂuctuations.  Thus  the  turbulent  ﬂuxes 
of  momentum  must  vanish.  At  the  ocean  free  surface  winds  apply  a  stress  that 
drives  strongly  turbulent  motions.  Finally,  ﬂuxes  of  heat,  salt,  and  moisture  at  the 
boundaries  can  generate  vigorous  turbulent  convection.  Before  discussing  in  detail 
the  physics  of  planetary  boundary  layers  in  the  ocean  and  atmosphere,  it  is  useful  to 
review  some  fundamental  results  that  apply  to  all  turbulent  boundary  layers. 

16.1  Frictional  Boundary  Layers 

Let  us  consider  turbulence  at  solid  boundaries.  At  such  boundaries,  the  condition 
that  the  ﬂuid  velocity  is  zero  applies  at  every  instant  in  time.  Thus  it  applies  to  the 
mean  velocity  and  the  ﬂuctuations  separately, 
u�  = 0. 

u¯ = 0, 

(16.1) 

The  fact  that  the  ﬂuctuations  drop  to  zero  at  the wall  has  the  particular  implication 
that  the  Reynolds  stress  vanish, 
−uiuj  = 0. 
The  only  stress  exerted  directly  on  the  wall  is  the  viscous  one.  Away  from  the  wall, 
instead, turbulence generates a Reynolds stress typically large compared to the viscous 
stress.  Tritton  (chapter  5,  page  337)  shows  in  Figure  21.12  the  transition  between 
a  viscous  stress  and  a  turbulent  stress  in  a  turbulent  boundary  layer  experiment 
(Schubauer,  J.  Appl.  Physics,  1954).  The  total  stress  parallel  to  the  wall  does  not

change  with  distance  from  the  wall,  but  there  is  an  exchange  of  balance  between  the 
viscous  and  turbulent  contributions.

16.1.1  Turbulent  motions  near  a  wall 

To simplify the algebra let us consider a parallel irrotational ﬂow over a ﬂat boundary. 
Turbulence  is  generated  because  the  no-slip  condition  ¯u = 0  at  the  boundary  means 
that  a  shear  layer  results,  and  vorticity  is  introduced  into  the  ﬂow.  Boundary-layer 
ﬂows are more complicated  than  free  shear ﬂows, because  the  importance of viscosity 
at the boundaries (which enforces the no-slip condition) introduces a new spatial scale 
in  the  problem.  As  a  result  there  is  a  viscous  sublayer  next  to  the wall,  whose width 
is  set  by  viscous  forces,  and  a  high  Re  boundary  layer,  whose  thickness  is  controlled 
by the turbulent Reynolds stresses.  These two layers are separated by an inertial sub-
layer.  The three diﬀerent regions of the boundary layer are somewhat analogous to the 
viscous range, inertial range, and forcing ranges of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence. 

1.  The  viscous  sublayer 
For  distances  close  to  the  wall,  i.e.  z < zf  where  zf  is  the  distance  at  which  Re = 1, 
friction is important.  This can be compared to length scales l ≈ 1/kd  in homogeneous 
turbulence,  where  viscosity  is  important. 

2.  The  inertial  sublayer 
At  distances  further  away  from  the  wall  than  zf ,  we  can  neglect  viscosity.  Similarly, 
if  we  are  not  close  to  the  edge  of  the  boundary  layer  at  z  =  δ ,  we  can  assume  that 
the  ﬂow  will  not  depend  directly  on  the  size  of  the  boundary  layer.  Therefore  we 
have  an  inertial  sublayer  for  zf  << z  << δ .  This  region  is  similar  to  the  inertial 
range  in  homogeneous  turbulence,  where  the  ﬂow  is  not  aﬀected  by  ν  or  by  k0 ,  the 
wavenumber  of  the  energy  input. 

3.  The  turbulent  boundary  layer 
The  full  turbulent  boundary  layer  is  determined  by  the maximum  size  of  the  eddies, 
the  so-called  the  integral  scale  δ .  This  region  corresponds  to  the  forcing  range  of  3D 
turbulence. 

4.  The  ambient  ﬂow 
Finally  at  some  distance  z > δ ,  the  ﬂow  is  no  longer  turbulent  and  we  are  in  the 
irrotational  ambient  ﬂow.

(16.3) 

We  will  assume  a  constant  background  ﬂow  u¯0 ,  which  is  independent  of  distance 
along  the  plate  x  and  distance  normal  to  the  plate  z .  We  assume  2-dimensional  ﬂow 
(∂ /∂ y = 0),  and  also  assume  that  downstream  evolution  is  slow.  If L  is  a  streamwise 
lengthscale,  we  are  assuming  δ/L  <<  1,  so  that  we  can  neglect  variations  in  the 
streamwise  direction  compared  to  those  in  the  vertical  for  averaged  variables  (i.e. 
�

∂ /∂x = 0).  Given  these  assumptions,  the  Reynolds  averaged  equations  become,

this  stress  is  constant  throughout  the  boundary  layer.  Near  the  boundary  the  stress 
is  dominated  by  the  viscous  term.  Away  from  the  boundary  we  will  have, 
τ  = −w �u� . 

(16.6) 

We  can  deﬁne  a  velocity  scale  from  this  surface  stress 

u 2  = τ ,

(16.7) 

where  u is  the  friction  velocity.  Away  from  the  boundary  eq.  (16.6)  implies  that 
∗ 
u∗  is  the  turbulent  velocity  ﬂuctuation magnitude. 

16.1.3  Viscous  sublayer:  law  of  the  wall 

The  frictional  length  scale  zf  is  the  scale  at  which  Re  =  1,  i.e.  the  scale  at  which 
the  viscous  and  turbulent  stresses  are  of  comparable  magnitude.  Thus  the  frictional 
length  scale  can  be  deﬁned  as, 

ν 
. 
u∗ 
This  lengthscale determines the transition between the inertial and viscous sublayers. 

(16.8) 

zf  =

In  the  viscous  sublayer  z < zf ,  the  velocity must  depend  on  z ,  the  distance  from  the 
�

wall,  u∗ ,  the  friction  velocity  and  ν ,  the  viscosity.  We  can  write  this  relationship  as, 
∗ 
zu

(16.9)

u¯
∗ 
u

Note  that  ¯u  has  been  nondimensionalized  by  u∗ ,  and  the  distance  z  has  been  nondi­
mensionalized  by  the  frictional  lengthscale  ν /u∗ .  We  can  rewrite  the  relation  in 
nondimensional  form, 

u¯+  = f (z + ) 

(16.10) 

where  ¯u+  = ¯
u/u

∗  and  z+  = zu∗/ν .

Near  a  rough  wall,  the  characteristic  scale  instead  of  being  controlled  by  a  frictional 
scale,  it  may  be  controlled  by  roughness  length  z0 ,  if  z0  > zf ,  and  the  self-similar 
solution  in  eq.  (16.10) must  be  interpreted  with  z+  = z/z0 . 

We  can  also  derive  the  exact  proﬁle  of  velocity  in  the  viscous  sublayer  very  close  to 
the  wall  through  the  following  argument.  At  the  wall, 

and  taken  in  conjunction  with  the  continuity  equation, 

u = w = 0, 

gives,

Outside  the  viscous  sublayer,  we  can  neglect  viscosity.  Thus  the  only  dimensional 
parameters  that  enter  in  the  problem  are  the  turbulent  velocity  scale  u∗ ,  the  total

this  dependence  as,

This relationship states that the mean velocity gradient, d ¯u/dz , which is the reciprocal 
of  a  transverse  time  scale  for  the  mean  ﬂow,  has  to  be  of  order  u∗/δ  and  varies  on 
spatial  scales  of  order  δ .  Notice  that  we  cannot  make  a  similar  scaling  argument  for 
the  mean  velocity  ¯u  and  say  that  u¯ =  u∗g(z/δ),  because  the  mean  velocity  depends 
on  an  additional  external  parameter,  the  velocity  outside  the  boundary  layer  ¯u0 .  We 
know  that  for  z/δ → ∞,  we  have  ¯u

We  can  now  integrate  from  z = ∞  in  toward  the  boundary  to  obtain  ¯u,

This similarity solution is only valid outside of the viscous boundary layer, and cannot 
satisfy  the  boundary  condition  ¯u = 0  at  the  wall.

Inertial  sublayer:  logarithmic  layer 

Thus far we have two diﬀerent laws for  ¯u+ .  One applies close to the wall in the viscous 
sublayer  and  satisﬁes  the  no-slip  condition  u¯ =  0.  The  other  applies  further  away 
from  the  wall  and  is  not  guaranteed  to  satisfy  the  no-slip  boundary  condition  at  the 
wall;  actually  it  turns  out  that  away  from  the  wall  u∗  �  u¯0  and  thus  u¯ − u¯0  ≈  u¯0 . 
This  indicates  that the viscous  sublayer with very  steep gradients  is  required  in order 
to  satisfy  the  boundary  conditions.  Of  course  the  velocity  doesn’t  suddenly  jump 
from  one  scaling  behavior  to  another  - there  is  a  transition  region.  In  this  transition 
region  we  expect  both  the  law  of  the  wall  and  the  velocity  defect  law  to  apply.

Hinze  (chapter  7,  pag.  477)  in  ﬁgure  1.6.1  show  the  mean  velocity  distribution  adi­
a jent  to  a  smooth  wall,  showing  the  logarithmic  distribution  away  from  the  viscous 
region next to the wall and the  linear region  in the viscous sublayer  from a composite 
of  diﬀerent  laboratory  experiments. 

The  value  of  the  Von  Karman  constant  has  been  measured  in  a  variety  of  labora­
tory  ﬂows  that  indicate  a  universal  value  of  0.41.  Some  early  measurements  in  the 
atmosphere  (Businger  et  al.,  1971)  suggested  a  much  smaller  value  of  0.35,  and  this 
led  to  speculations  for  a  while  that  the  constant might  not  be  universal,  but  instead 
a  function  of  salient  nondimensional  numbers  in  the  ﬂow  (for  example  the  Rossby 
number).  Careful  reexamination  of  the  errors  involved  (Hogstrom,  1996)  and  more 
recent observations (Zhang, 1988) indicate that the constant is indeed a constant with 
a  value  around  0.40 ± 0.01. 

16.1.6  Coherent  structures 

From  lecture  1  we  emphasized  the  fact  that  any  turbulent  ﬂow  involves  large  ed­
dies  with  a  coherent  structure:  turbulent  boundary  layers  are  no  exceptions  to  the 
rule.  Tritton  (chapter  21,  pages  344–350)  reviews  the  observations  and  properties  of 
coherent  structures  in  boundary  layers. 

16.2  Stratiﬁed  Boundary  Layers 

At  a  boundary,  in  addition  to  surface  stresses  acting  as  a  source  of  vorticity,  we 
may  also have buoyancy  forcing  (for  example  atmospheric heating  and  cooling  at  the 
ocean  surface,  or  radiant  heating  at  the  land  surface).  Whether  the  dynamics  of  the 
turbulent  boundary  layer  are mostly  aﬀected  by  buoyancy  forcing  or  by  shear  eﬀects 
can  be  quantiﬁed  in  terms  of  the  ﬂux  Richardson  number, 
w � b�
. 
u�w �∂ ¯
u/∂ z 

(16.30) 

Rf  = 

We have seen  in the  lecture on energetics that the ﬂux Richardson number represents 
the ratio between TKE buoyancy production and TKE shear production.  Recall that 
positive values of Rf  imply stable stratiﬁcation, when TKE is lost to PE, and negative 
values  imply  unstable  stratiﬁcation,  when  PE  generates  TKE.  Hence  if  Rf  >  1,  we 
expect the surface buoyancy ﬂuxes to suppress the boundary layer turbulence, while if 
Rf  < −1 we  expect  the  boundary  turbulence  to  be  dominated  by  convective mixing, 

7


rather  than  shear  generated  turbulence.  For  −1  < Rf  <  1,  the  shear  production  of 
turbulence  dominates  and  frictional  boundary  layer  theory  applies. 

We  can  express  the  transition  between  buoyancy  generated  turbulence  to  shear  gen­
erated turbulence also in terms of vertical length scales.  Using boundary layer scaling 
we  have, 

∂ ¯u 
u∗

u∗ 
When  |Rf | = 1,  then  the  buoyancy  production/loss  of TKE  is  of  equal magnitude  to 
shear  production.  This  occurs  at  a  lengthscale,

Lb  =

κ|w � b� |

κ|w � b�

This  is  the  Monin-Obukhov  lengthscale.  If  w � b�
0  >  0  the  ﬂux  is  destabilizing. 
Then  for distances  from  the boundary z < Lb ,  the  shear production dominates, while 
for distances  z > Lb , buoyant  convection dominates.  If w � b�
0  < 0  for distances  z > Lb 
the  turbulence  is  damped  by  the  stable  stratiﬁcation.

is  neither  stable  or  unstable,  i.e.  at  vanishing  w � b�
0 ,  hence  z/Lb 
0,  and  φ(z/Lb )
must  tend  to  unity.  Large  positive  w � b�
0  generates  vigorous  convection  and  reduce 
stress-induced  mechanical  turbulence  to  insigniﬁcance.  At  moderate  positive  w � b�
0 , 
or  z/Lb  of  order  −1,  mechanical  and  convective  turbulence  are  both  important  and 
eq.  (16.35)  is  useful.  At  the  other  extreme,  large  negative  buoyancy  ﬂux  overwhelms 

8


mechanical  turbulence  to  the  point  of  completely  suppressing  it.  At moderately  high 
negative  w � b�
0  (i.e.  positive  and  small  z/Lb ),  eq.  (16.35)  is  still  valid.  The  negative 
buoyancy ﬂux in the TKE equation implies that work is expended into against gravity 
to raise heavier ﬂuid up from lower levels.  The PE production must balance the loss of 
TKE, resulting in less vigorous shear turbulence, and sharper mean velocity gradients. 

Boundary layer meteorologists have explored buoyancy eﬀects on the atmospheric sur­
face  layer  and proposed  several diﬀerent  empirical  formulae  for  the  function φ(z/Lb ), 
separately for stable and unstable conditions.  A few are reported in Csanady (Air-sea 
interaction,  chapter  1.4.4). 

Further  reading:  Tennekes  and  Lumley,  chapters  2.5,  3.4  and  5;  Lesieur,  chapter  4, 
section  1.2.6;  Hinze  chapter  7;  Phillips,  chapter  6.6. 

16.2.2  The  buoyancy  proﬁle 

We have seen that in turbulent ﬂows the Reynolds ﬂuxes of tracers like buoyancy w � b� 
are  the  mean  vehicles  of  transport  to  or  from  the  boundaries,  just  as  the  Reynolds 
stress  is  for  momentum.  Much  alike  in  the  case  of  momentum,  the  ﬁnal  step  at  the 
interface has to be transfer by molecular diﬀusion.  This means that diﬀusive boundary 
layers develop at the boundary.  Turbulent eddy motions conﬁne these boundary layers 
to  the  immediate vicinity of  the  interface,  counteracting  the  tendency of  the diﬀusive 
boundary  layers  to  grow. 

Well  above  the  diﬀusive  boundary  layers,  the  inﬂuence  of  molecular  properties  be­
comes  imperceptible  and  we  have  an  inertial  sublayer.  Under  the  same  assumptions 
considered  for  the momentum budget,  gradients  of mean buoyancy  then depend  only 
on  the  buoyancy  ﬂux  and  the  two  scales  of  turbulence, 

d¯b 
dz 

= func(w � b� , u∗ , z ). 

(16.36) 

There  are  four  variables  in  this  equation,  and  three  units  of  length,  time,  and  buoy­
ancy.  Hence,  they can be combined  into a single nondimensional variable that should 
be constant.  We introduce a buoyancy scale as b = −w � b�/u∗ , the negative sign being 
∗ 
chosen  so  that  b∗  has  the  same  sign as  b(z ) − bs , where  bs  is  the buoyancy at  the  solid 
boundary.  Eq.  (16.36)  in  nondimensional  form  is  then,

The  boundary  layers  in  geophysical  ﬂows  are  also  aﬀected  by  rotation  through  the 
Coriolis  force.  This  is  discussed  by  Tennekes  and  Lumley,  chapter  5.3.
