Transport  of  passive  and  active 
tracers  in  turbulent  ﬂows 

A  property  of  turbulence  is  to  greatly  enhance  transport  of  tracers.  For  example, 
a  dissolved  sugar  molecule  takes  years  to  diﬀuse  across  a  coﬀee  cup,  relying  only  on 
molecular agitation (actually on that time scale the coﬀee will surely evaporate).  With 
a spoon, the coﬀee drinker can create eddies that transport dissolved sugar throughout 
the  cup  in  less  than  a  second.  This  enhanced  transport  is  generally  described  as  an 
eddy  diﬀusivity. 

The  concept  of  eddy  diﬀusivity  is  often  justiﬁed  by  appealing  to  an  analogy  between 
turbulent  eddies  and  molecular  diﬀusion.  The  argument  goes  that  turbulent  eddies 
move  tracer  parcels  in  erratic motions, much  alike  bombardment  by molecular  agita­
tion  in  Brownian  motion,  and  thus  the  action  of  turbulence  may  be  represented  as 
an  enhanced  diﬀusion.  This  concept  was  formalized  by  Taylor’s  theory  of  turbulent 
dispersion.  Taylor  showed  that  the  spreading  of  particles  in  a  turbulent  ﬁeld  can  be 
described  in  terms  of  an  eddy  diﬀusivity.  The  diﬀusivity  introduced  by  Taylor  is  a 
Lagrangian  quantity  deﬁned  in  terms  of  the  Lagrangian  velocity  experienced  by  par­
ticles.  In  this  lecture we  show  that, under  certain approximation  to be discussed,  the 
concept of  eddy diﬀusivity  can be  extended  to Eulerian variables.  The Eulerian  eddy 
diﬀusivity  describes  the  spreading  of  tracers  rather  than  particles.  Can  you  guess 
what  is  the  diﬀerence? 

3.1  Tracer  transport  in  Eulerian  coordinates 

We  approach  the  parameterization  of  eddy  transport  of  tracers  in  a  systematic  way. 
We  derive  an  equation  for  the  mean  tracer  concentration  where  the  eddy  eﬀects  are 

1


represented  as  the  sum  of  a  tracer  diﬀusion  by  an  eﬀective  diﬀusivity  and  advection 
by  a  Stokes  drift.  We  will  compare  this  result  with  the  Lagrangian  description  of 
dispersion. 

Once  again  we  use  a  Reynolds  decomposition  of  variables  into  mean  and  eddy  com­
ponents.  We depart from the advection-diﬀusion equation for a generic passive tracer 
of  concentration  c, 
ct  + u · �c = κ�2 c, 
(3.1) 
where  κ  is  the  molecular  diﬀusivity  and  u  is  an  incompressible  (� · u  =  0)  velocity 
ﬁeld.  The  velocity  ﬁeld  is  given  in  this  problem,  i.e.  we  do  not  write  a  momentum 
equation to solve for the velocity ﬁeld.  The equation for the mean tracer concentration 
is, 
c¯t  + u¯ · �c¯ + � · u�c�  = κ�2c.¯
(3.2) 
The  fundamental  problem  of  tracer  turbulence  is  to  determine  the  eﬀect  of  the 
Reynolds  ﬂuxes  u�c�  on  the mean  tracer  concentration. 
In  order  to  determine  the  Reynolds  ﬂuxes,  we must  solve  the  equation  for  the  tracer

ﬂuctuations, 
t  + u¯ · �c�  + � ·  u�c�  − u�c�  − κ�2 c�  = −u�  · �c.¯
c�
(3.3) 
Inspection  of  eq.  (3.3)  further  suggests  that  if  c�  =  0  at  t  =  0  then,  c�  and  �c¯ are 
linearly related at all times.  The equation for the tracer ﬂuctuations is linear in c�  for a 
prescribed velocity ﬁeld and it is forced by �c¯:  doubling the forcing doubles the tracer 
ﬂuctuations.  In  other  words  we  are  stating  that  tracer  ﬂuctuations  c�  are  generated 
by advective distortion of  the mean gradient, �c¯.  It  follows  that  the  eddy ﬂux u�c�  is 
linearly  related  to  the  mean  gradient  �c¯.  The  coeﬃcient  of  proportionality  between 
the  tracer  ﬂux  and  the  mean  tracer  gradient  turns  out  to  be  the  eddy  diﬀusivity 
introduced  in  the  previous  lecture. 

3.2  Eddy  ﬂuxes  and  the  multi-scale  method 

Using  an  assumption  of  scale  separation  between  the  turbulent  eddies  and  the mean, 
we  will  show  how  the  concept  of  a  tracer  diﬀusivity  arises  in  a  Eluerian  context. 
The  scale  separation  approach  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  advected  tracer 
is weakly  inhomogeneous on a  scale L much greater  than  the  scale  l0  of  the  turbulent 
ﬂuctuations.  The  goal  is  then  to  derive  equations  for  the  evolution  of  the  coarse-
grained  averaged  tracer  on  the  length  scale  L,  and  on  a  time  scale  T  large  compared 
with  the  time  scale  t0  ∼  l0/u0 ,  characteristic  of  the  energy  containing  eddies  of  the 
turbulence.  We  may  then  choose  an  intermediate  scale  λ,  e.g.  λ  = (l0L)1/2 ,  and  an 
intermediate  time  τ ,  e.g.  τ  = (t0T )1/2 ,  satisfying, 
t0  � τ  � T , 
l0  � λ � L, 

(3.4)

and  think  of  the  overbar  average  as  a  “local  average”  over  a  cube  of  side  λ,  and  a 
time  of  order  τ .  Averaged  quantities  will  vary  only  on  larger  scales  of  order  L  and 
longer  times  of  order  T .  The  replacement  of  ensemble  and  volume/time  averages  is 
possible  only  if  the  turbulence  is  homogeneous  and  stationary  on  the  small  spatial 
and  temporal  scales,  so  that  an  ergodic  assumptions  can  be made. 

The  multi-scale  method  that  we  use  here  was  ﬁrst  introduced  by  Papanicolaou  and 
Pirroneau  (1981).  The  scale  separation  assumption  suggests  that  a  perturbation 
expansion  can  be  done  in  terms  of  the  small  parameter  � ≡  l0/L.  Suppose  now  that 
c(x, 0)  is  slowly  varying  so  that, 

c(x, 0) = C0 (�x). 
Eq.  (3.1),  together  with  the  initial  condition  in  eq.  (3.5)  suggests  a  multiple  scale 
analysis  with  the  slow  variables, 

(3.5) 

X  = �x, X2  = �2 x,

T  = �t, T2  = �2 t. 

(3.6) 

The  solution  of  eq.  (3.1)  then  takes  the  form, 

c(x, t; �) = C0 (X , T ) + � C1 (x, t; X , T ) + �2C2 (x, t; X , T ) + . . . . 

(3.7) 

The  quantity  of  interest  is  the  large-scale,  long-time,  averaged  ﬁeld  ¯c = C0 (X , T ) + 
O(�).  Its evolution is obtained by usual asymptotic methods.  Substituting the expan­
sion (3.7) into the advection diﬀusion equation (3.1), one obtains a series of equations 
order  by  order  in  �. 

The  advecting  velocity  ﬁeld  must  be  expanded  as  well.  We  will  assume  that  the 
velocity ﬁeld  is  composed of a mean ﬂow varying on  the  slow variables only U (X , T ) 
and  a  turbulent  perturbations  u� , 
u ≡ U (X , T ) + u� (x, t; X , T ). 

(3.8) 

We do not assume that the mean ﬂow is of small amplitude compared to the turbulent 
ﬂow  as  it  is  often  done  in  the  literature  of  eddy mean  ﬂow  interactions 

3.2.1  Zeroth  order  solution 

O(�0) : 

Let’s  write  the  series  of  equations  order  by  order  in  �.  At  ﬁst  order  we  have, 
C0t  + (U  + u� ) · �xC0  − κ�2 C0  = 0. 
x
The  solution  to  this  equation,  satisfying  the  assumption  that  the  initial  tracer  con­
centration  is  smooth,  has  the  general  form, 
C0  = C0 (X , T , X2 , T2 ).

O(�) : 

C1t  + (u�  + U ) · �xC1  − κ�x
2 C1  = −C0T  − (u�  + U ) · �X C0 . 
(3.11) 

Averaging  over  the  small  and  fast  scales  scales,  we  have, 
C0T  + U  · �X C0  = 0, 

(3.12) 

from  which  it  follows  that, 
C1t  + (u�  + U ) · �xC1  − κ�x
2 C1  = −u�  · �X C0 . 
(3.13) 
Solutions  to  this  problem  can  be  written  in  the  form  C1  =  −(ξ  · �)C0  + C1 (X , T ), 
with  ξ(x, t)  satisfying  the  equation, 
ξt  + (U  + u� ) · �xξ − κ�x
2 ξ = u� . 
This equation resembles the equation  for a particle displacement,  except  for the pres­
ence  of  the molecular  diﬀusive  term.  This  diﬀerence  is  extremely  important,  because 
molecular diﬀusion is ultimately the only process that can mix the tracer.  Any theory 
of  diﬀusion  which  neglects  molecular  processes  must  be  taken  with  suspicion.  The 
terms  C1 (X , T )  represents  a  small  correction  to  the  initial  tracer  concentration.

By  taking  the  large  scale  and  long  time  average  of  this  equation,  we  obtain  the

is  the  eﬀective  diﬀusivity  tensor. 

Summing  the  solvability  conditions  at  O(�)  and  O(�2 )  we  obtain  the  evolution  equa­
tion  for  the mean  tracer  concentration, 
c¯t  + u¯ · �c¯ = ∂xi [Dij ∂xj c¯]. 
(3.22) 
The  mean  tracer  concentration  is  given  by  c¯ =  C0  +  �C1  and  derivatives  include 
variations on  the  slow  space and  time of ﬁrst  seond order.  The eﬀective diﬀusivity D 
is  obtained  by  solving  eq.  (3.14)  and  computing  the  correlations  between  ξ  and  the 
velocity  ﬂuctuations  u� . 

3.2.4  Eddy  diﬀusivity 

The  main  result  of  the  multiple  scale  analysis  is  that  there  is  a  relationship  between 
the  eddy  ﬂux  u�c�  and  the mean  tracer  gradient �c¯, 
ic�  = −Dij ∂xj c.¯
u�
We  want  to  understand  what  is  the  meaning  of  this  diﬀusivity.  Let  us  decompose 
diﬀusivity  tensor  into  its  symmetric  and  antisymmetric  components, 

(3.23) 

D = Ds  + Da , 

where  the  symmetric  component  is, 
ij  ≡

The  ﬁrst  line  is  symmetric  and  represents  the  diﬀusive  component.  The  second  line 
is  asymmetric  and  is  the  skew  component.  Molecular  diﬀusion  contributes  a  positive 
deﬁnite  term  to  the  diﬀusive  component.

3.2.5  Antisymmetric  component  of  the  eddy  diﬀusivity 

The  role  of  the  antisymmetric  component  of  the  diﬀusivity  tensor  is  best  interpreted 
if  we  write Da  in  the  form, 
ij  = −�ij kΨk . 
Da 
This  is  the  generic  form  of  an  antisymmetric  tensor  in  three  dimensions,  i.e.  any 
antisymmetric  tensor can be written  in  the  form  (3.29).  The  tracer ﬂux associated  to 
the  antisymmetric  component  of  the  diﬀusivity  is  the  so  called  skew  ﬂux, 
u�c� a  = −Da ∂xj c¯ = �ij kΨk ∂xj c¯ = Ψ × �c.¯
ij 

(3.30) 

(3.29) 

The  skew  ﬂux  can  also  be  written  as, 
� · u�c� = � × (Ψc¯) − (� × Ψ) · �c¯ = � × Ψc¯ + u¯ S  · �c,¯
a 

where, 

u¯ S  = −� × Ψ. 

(3.31) 

(3.32) 

The  skew ﬂux  is  therefore equal  to the  sum of a  rotational ﬂux and an advective ﬂux. 
The  rotational  ﬂux  does  not  aﬀect  the  tracer  evolution,  since  it  has  no  divergence. 
The  advective  component  represent  the  transport  of  tracer  by  the  Stokes  drift  u¯ S .

Changes  in  tracer  variance  can  be  induced  by  the  terms  inside  the  divergence  or 
the  term  in  the  rhs.  The  terms  inside  the  divergence  depends  both  on  the  antisym­
metric  and  the  symmetric  components  of  the  eddy  diﬀusivity.  The  term  on  the  rhs 
instead  depends  on  the  symmetric  component  only.  The  terms  inside  the  divergence 
represent  processes  that move  tracer  variance  around  the  ﬂuid  without  changing  the 
total  integral  of  the  tracer  variance.  The  rhs  term,  instead,  represent  a  net  source  of 
tracer variance.  hence only the symmetric component of the eddy diﬀusivity represent 
processes  that  enhance/reduce  tracer  ﬂuctuations.

The  molecular  processes  and  transience  terms  that  appear  in  the  symmetric  com­
ponent  of  the  eddy  diﬀusivity  tend  to  reduce  the  tracer  variance,  i.e.  they  tend  to 
homogenize  the mean  tracer  concentration.

3.2.8  Summary  about  eddy  diﬀusivity 

In  summary  then, 

7 

•	 The  symmetric  part  of  the  diﬀusivity  tensor  corresponds  to  something  like  dif­
fusive  transport. 
•	 The  antisymmetric  part,  which  is  almost  never  zero,  and  it  is  in  fact  usually 
dominant  for  rotationally  dominated waves,  corresponds  to  an  advective  trans­
port.  As  a  result,  the mean  advecting  velocity  that  appears  in  eq.  (3.22)  is  not 
u¯ ,  but  the  velocity u¯ + u¯ S .  This  seems  to  be  telling  us  that  the Eulerian mean 
velocity  u¯ is  not  the most  natural  choice  of  “mean”. 

3.3  The  Transformed  Eulerian  Mean 

The  TEM  formalism  hinges  on  a  transformation  of  the  mean  tracer  equation  to  de­
compose  the  eddy  ﬂux  in  an  advective  and  a  diﬀusive  components  analogous  to  the 
Stokes  drift  and  diﬀusivity  encountered  above.  The  TEM  decomposition,  however, 
does  not  require  a  scale  separation  assumption.  Consider  a  tracer  of  concentration  c, 
that  satisﬁes  a  conservation  equation  of  the  form, 
ct  + u · �c = S {c},	
(3.43) 
where S {c} represents sources and sinks of tracer.  The velocity ﬁeld  is assumed to be 
divergenceless,  i.e.  � · u = 0.  Following a Reynolds decomposition of variables  into a 
slowly  changing  mean  and  ﬂuctuations,  the  mean  conservation  budget  for  the  tracer 
c  is, 
c¯t  + u¯ · �c¯ = −� · F {c} + S¯{c},	
(3.44) 
where F {c} = u�c�  is the eddy ﬂux of c.  The manipulation of such equations to obtain 
a  transformed  set  hinges  on  the  introduction  of  a  nondivergent  residual  circulation 
u¯ †  ≡  u¯ + � × ΨT ,  where  the  choice  of  the  vector  streamfunction  ΨT  is  left  for  the 
moment  open.  In  terms  of  the  residual  circulation  the  budget  in  (3.44)  becomes, 
c¯t  + u¯ †  · �c¯ = −� · F †{c} + S¯{c},	
where  we  introduced  the  residual  ﬂux, 
F †{c} ≡ F {c} − Ψ × �c.¯	
(3.46) 
We are  free  to drop  the  term � × (ΨT c¯)  in  the deﬁnition of F †{c}, because  this  term 
is  non-divergent  and  does  not  aﬀect  the  evolution  of  ¯c. 

(3.45) 

The  residual  ﬂux  and  the  full  ﬂux  have  the  same  pro jection  along  the  mean  tracer 
gradient, 
F †{c} · �c¯ = F {c} · �c,¯	
(3.47) 
but have diﬀerent pro jections in the plane orthogonal to �c¯.  Thus the vector stream-
function Ψ can be chosen in such a way as to eliminate the ﬂux component in the plane 

8


orthogonal  to  �c¯,  the  so-called  skew  ﬂux,  leaving  just  the  ﬂux  component  along  �c¯
to  remain  in F †{c}.  This manipulation  has  advantages  from  a modeling  perspective, 
because  the parameterization problem  is  simpler  for  the down-gradient component of 
a  ﬂux,  than  for  the  skew  component. 

The decomposition of the eddy ﬂux into components across and along the mean tracer 
gradient  is  given  by,

where we neglected diﬀusive ﬂuxes in the mean budgets.  If the eddy variance equation 
is  steady  and  homogeneous,  then F †{c} · �c¯ ≤ 0  suggesting  a  downgradient  diﬀusive 
closure  for  the  residual  ﬂux. 

This deﬁnition of residual streamfunction is generally diﬀerent from the Stokes stream-
function.  We  can  see  this  plugging  the  expression  for  the  eddy  ﬂux  derived  in  the

spects.  First  we  ignore  any  Stokes  drift  along  tracer  surfaces,  because  it  does  not 
advect  tracer.  Second  we  add  to  the  streamfunction  any  diﬀusive  term  that  is  di­
rected  along  tracer  contours,  because  it  does  not  aﬀect  the  tracer  variance  budget. 
This  additional  term  represents  a  drift  of  the  baricenter  of  a  tracer  patch  due  to 
variations  in  the  rate  of  diﬀusion  along  a  tracer  isosurface. 

In  geophysical  ﬂow  it  is  often  the  case  that  eddy  ﬂuxes  are  directed  along  isentropic 
surface,  i.e.  the  eddy  ﬂuxes  are  adiabatic.  In  this  case  it  is  accurate  to  assume  that 
the diﬀusive ﬂux is down the mean gradient of the tracer ¯c pro jected along the entropy

This  term  clearly  vanishes  if  one  uses  the  tracer  entropy  b  to  deﬁne  the  residual

The  Transformed  Eulerian  Mean  decomposition  shows  that  the  turbulent  eddies  af­
fect  the  evolution  of  the  mean  tracer  concentration  through  advective  and  diﬀusive 
components.  The  advective  component  depends  on  the  skew  eddy  ﬂux,  i.e.  the  ﬂux 
along  tracer  contours.  This  component  is  hard  to  predict  because  it  depends  on  the 
details  of  the  correlations  between  eddy  velocities  and  displacements.  The  diﬀusive 
component,  instead,  has  a  simpler  behavior.  It  tends  to  spread  tracer  concentration. 
While  the  spatial  variations  of  the  eddy  diﬀusivity  are  key  to  predict  the  advective 
component,  the magnitude  of  the  diﬀusive  component  is  all  that  is  needed  to  predict 
the  correct  destruction  of  tracer  variance.  For  all  these  reasons,  it  seems  possible  to 
derive  closures  for  the  diﬀusive  component  of  the  eddy  ﬂux,  while  closures  for  the 
advective  component  might  be  beyond  our  grasp.  In  this  section,  we  will  discuss 
techniques to estimate the diﬀusive component of the tracer ﬂux.  In the next  lecture, 
we  will  show  how  to  make  the  advective  component  of  the  tracer  ﬂux  part  of  the 
prognostic  variables,  so  that  we  do  not  need  to  parameterize  it.

Let  us  consider  our  3D  tracer  ﬁeld.  We  assume  that  instantaneous  iso-surfaces  of 
tracer  are  closed  (though  the  theory  works  also  if  they  encounter  boundaries).  We 
wish  to  express  the  tracer  equation  in  tracer  coordinates.  In  this  framework,  ad­
vection  will  become  part  of  the  coordinate  system:  advection  moves  tracer  surfaces 
around.  The only remaining ﬂux is the eddy transport across tracer contours,  i.e.  the 
diﬀusive  tracer  ﬂux.  The  idea  was  ﬁrst  introduced  by Noboru Nakamura  (Journal  of 
Atmospheric  Sciences,  52,  2096-2108).

The volume of each cell  is given by the  integral over the  full surface A of  its thickness 
dc/|�c|.  For deﬁniteness, we assume that the closed region is a minimum of c, so that 
A  is  a  monotonically  increasing  function  of  C .  Note  that  this  integral  can  include 
multiply  connected  volumes,  if  there  are  multiple  blobs  enclosing  the  same  tracer
