18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 20 

Okay, those are the formulas. You w ill get all of those on the test, plus a couple 
more that I w ill g ive you today. Those w ill be the basic formulas of the Lap lace 
transform. If I think you need anything else, I'll give you other stuff, too. So, I'm 
going to leave those on the board all period. The basic test for today is to see how 
Laplace transforms are used to solve linear differential equations with constant 
coefficients. Now,  to do that, we're going to have to take the Laplace transform of a 
derivative. 

And, in order to make sense of that procedure, we're going to have to ask, I 
apologize in advance, but a slightly theoretical question, namely, we have to have 
some guarantee in advance that the Laplace transform is going to exist. Now, how 
could the Laplace transform fa il to exist? Can't I always calculate this? And the 
answer is, no, you can't a lways ca lculate it because this  is an improper integral. I'm 
integrating all the way up to  infinity, and you know that improper integrals don't 
always converge. 

You know,  if the  integrand for examp le just didn't have the exponentia l factor there, 
were simply t dt, that it might look like it made sense, but that integra l doesn't 
converge. And, anyway, it has no value. So, I need conditions in advance, which 
guarantee that the Laplace transforms will exist. Only under those circumstances will 
the formulas make any sense. Now, there is a standard condition that's in your book. 
But, I d idn't get a chance to ta lk about it  last time. So, I thought I'd better spent the 
first few minutes today talking about the cond ition because it's what we're going to 
need in order to be able to solve differentia l equations. The condition that makes the 
Laplace transform definitely exist for a function is that f(t) shouldn't grow too 
rapid ly. 

It can grow  rapid ly. It can grow because the e^(-st) is pulling it down, trying hard to 
pull it down to zero to make the integra l converge. All we have to do is to guarantee 
that it doesn't grow so rapid ly that the e to the minus s t is powerless to pull it down. 
Now, the condition is it's what's called a growth cond ition. These are very important 
in app lications, and unfortunately, it's a lways taught in 18.01, but it's not always 
taught in high school calculus. And, it's a question of how fast the function is allowed 
to grow. And, the cond ition is universally said this way, should be of exponentia l 
type. So, what I'm defining is the phrase "exponential type." I'll put it in quotation 
marks for that reason. 

What does this mean? It's a cond ition, a growth cond ition on a function, says how 
fast it can get b ig. It says that f(t) in size, since f of t might get negatively very 
large, and that would hurt, make the integral hard to converge, not likely to 
converge, use the absolute va lue. In other words, I don't care if f of t is going up or 
going down very low. Whichever way it goes, its size should not be bigger than a 
rapid ly growing exponential. And, here's a rap idly grow ing exponential. 

c is some positive constant, for some positive constant c and some positive constant 
k. And, this should be true for a ll va lues of t. All t greater than or equal to zero. I 
don't have to worry about negative va lues of t because the integra l doesn't care 
about them. I'm only doing the integration as t runs from zero to infinity. In other 
words, f(t) could have been an extremely w ild function, sewn a lot of oats or 
whatever functions do for negative values of t, and we don't care. It's only what's 
happening  from now  from time zero onto infinity. As long as it behaves now, from 
now on, it's okay. 

All right, so, the way it should behave is by being an exponential type. Now, to try to 
give you some feeling for what this means, these functions, for example, if k = 100, 
do you have any idea what the plot of e^(100t) looks like? It goes straight up. On 
every computer you try to plot it on, e^(100t) goes like that unless, of course, you 
make the sca le t equa ls zero to, over here, is one millionth. 

Well, even that won't do. Okay, so these functions rea lly can grow quite rap idly. Let's 
take an example and see what's of exponential type, and then perhaps even more 
interestingly, what isn't. The function sin(t),  is that of exponentia l type? Well, sure. 
Its absolute value is always less than or equa l to one. So, it's a lso this paradigm. If I 
take c equal to one, and what should  I take k to be? Zero. 

Take k to be zero, c equals one, and in fact sin(t) plays that cond ition. Here's one 
that's more interesting,  t^n. Think of t^100. Is that sma ller than some exponentia l 
with maybe a constant out front? Well, t^100 goes stra ight up, a lso. Well, we feel 
that if we make the exponentia l b ig enough, maybe  it will win out. In fact, you don't 
have to make the exponential big. k = 1 is good enough. In other words, I don't 
have to put absolute value signs around the t^n because I'm only thinking about t as 
being a positive number, anyway. 

I say that that's less than or equal to some constant M, positive constant M e^t will 
be good enough for some M and a ll t. Now, why is that? Why is that? The way to 
think of that, so, what this proves is that, therefore, t^n is of exponential type, 
which we could have guessed because after a ll we were able to calculate its Laplace 
transform. Now, just because you can calculate the Lap lace transform doesn't mean 
it's of exponentia l type, but in practical matters, it a lmost a lways does. So, t^n is of 
exponentia l type. How do you prove that? Well, the weighted secret is to look at t^n 
/ e^t. In other words, look at the quotient. 

What I'd like to argue is that this  is bounded by some number, cap ita l M. That's the 
question I'm asking. Now, why is this so? Well, I think I can convince you of it 
without having to work very hard. What does the graph of this function look like? It 
starts here, so I'm graphing this function, this ratio. When t is equa l to zero, its 
value is zero, right, because of the numerator. What happens as t goes to infinity? 
What happens to this? What does  it approach? Zero. And, why? By L'Hop. By 
L'Hopital's rule. Just keep differentiating, reapply the rule over and over, keep 
differentiating it n times, and finally you'll have won the numerator down to t^0, 
which isn't doing anything much. 

And, the denominator, no matter how many times you d ifferentiate it, it's still t, to 
the t a ll the time. So, by using Lopital's rule n times, you change the top to one or 
n!, actua lly; the bottom stays e^t, and the ratio clearly approaches zero, and 
therefore, it approached zero to start w ith. So, I don't know what this function's 
doing in between. It's a positive function. It's continuous because the top and 

bottom are continuous, and the bottom is never zero. So,  it's a continuous function 
which starts out at zero and is positive, and as t goes to infinity, it gets closer and 
closer to the t-axis, again. Well, what does t^n do? 

It might wave around. It doesn't actua lly. But, the point is, because it's continuous, 
starts at zero, ends at zero, it's bounded. It has a maximum somewhere. And, that 
maximum is M. So, it has a maximum. All you have to know is where it starts, and 
where it ends up, and the fact that  it's continuous. That guarantees that it has a 
maximum. So, it is less than some maximum, and that shows that it's of exponential 
type. Now, of course, before you get the idea that everything 's of exponential type, 
let's see what isn't. I'll give you two functions that are not of exponential type, for 
different reasons. 

1 / t is not of exponential type. Well, of course, it's not defined that t = 0. But, you 
know, it's okay for an integral not to be defined at one point because you're 
measuring an area, and when you measure an area, what happened to one point 
doesn't really matter much. That's not the thing. What's wrong with one over t is 
that the  integral doesn't converge at zero times 1 / t dt. 

That  integral, when t is near zero, this is approximately equa l to one, right? If t is 
zero, this  is one. So, it's  like the function, Integral from 0 to infinity of [1/t], near 
zero it's close to, it's like the integra l from zero to somep lace of no importance, dt / 
t. But, this does not converge. This is like ln(t), and log zero is minus infinity. So, it 
doesn't converge. 

So, 1 / t is not of exponential type. So, what's the L(1/t)? It doesn't have a Lap lace 
transform. Well, what if I put t = -n? What about t^(-1)? Well, that only works for 
positive integers, not negative integers. Okay, so it's not of exponential type. 
However, that's because it never really gets started properly. It's more fun to look at 
a function which is not of exponential type because it grows too  fast. Now, what's a 
function that grows faster that it grows so rapid ly that you can't find any function 
e^(kt) which bounds it? A function which grows too rap idly, a simple one is e^(t^2), 
grows too rapid ly to be of exponentia l type. 

And, the argument is simp le. No matter what you propose, it's always, for the K, no 
matter how big a number, use Avogadro's number, use anything you want. 
Ultimately, this is going to be b igger than k t no matter how big k is, no matter how 
big k is. When is this going to happen? This will happen  if t^2 > kt. In other words, 
as soon as t becomes bigger than k, you might have to wait quite a while for that to 
happen, but, as soon as t gets b igger than 10^(10^23), this e^(t^2) > 
e^(10^(10^23) * t). 

So, e^(t^2),  it's a simple function, a simp le elementary function. It grows so rapid ly 
it doesn't have a Lap lace transform. Okay, so how are we going to solve differentia l 
equations if e^(t^2)? I won't give you any. And, the reason I won't give you any: 
because I never saw one occur in rea l life. Nature, like sines, cosines, exponentia ls, 
are fine, I've never seen a physica l, you know, this  is just my ignorance. But, I've 
never seen a physical problem that involved a function grow ing as rapid ly as 
e^(t^2). 

That may be just my ignorance. But, I do know the Lap lace transform won't be used 
to solve differentia l equations involving such a  function. How about e^(-t^2)? That's 
different. It looks a lmost the same, but e to the minus t squared does this. It's very 

well-behaved. That's the curve, of course, that you're a ll afra id of. Don't panic. Okay. 
So, I'd like to expla in to you now how differentia l equations, maybe I should save--
I'll tell you what. We need more formulas. So, I'll put them, why don't I save this 
board, and instead, I'll describe to you the basic way Lap lace transforms are used to 
solve differential equations, what are they called, a parad igm. 

I'll show you the parad igm, and then we'll fill in the holes so you have some overa ll 
view of how the procedure goes, and then you'll understand where the various pieces 
fit  into it. I think you'll understand it better that way. So, what do we do? Start with 
the d ifferential equation. But, right away, there's a  fundamental difference between 
what the Laplace transform does, and what we've been doing up until now, namely, 
what you have to start w ith is not merely the differentia l equation. 

Let's say we have linear with constant coefficients. It's a lmost never used to solve 
any other type of problem. And, let's take second order so I don't have to do, 
because that's the kind we've been working w ith all term. But, it's allowed to be 
inhomogeneous, so, f(t). Let's call the something else, another letter, h(t). I'll want 
f(t) for the function I'm taking the Lap lace transform of. All right, now, the d ifference 
is that up to now, you know techniques for solving this just as it stands. The Laplace 
transform does not know how to solve this just doesn't stands. The Laplace 
transform must have an initia l va lue prob lem. In other words, you must supp ly from 
the beginning the initial cond itions that the y is to satisfy. 

Now, I don't want to say any specific numbers, so I'll use generic numbers. Well, but 
look, what do we do if we get a prob lem and there are no initial cond itions; does that 
mean we can't use the Lap lace transform? No, of course you can use it. But, you will 
just have to assume the initia l conditions are on the numbers. You'll say it but the 
initia l conditions be y0 and y0' , or whatever, a and b, whatever you want to call it. 

And now, the answer, then, will involve the a and the b or the y0 and y0'. But, you 
must, at least, give lip service to the initia l cond itions, whereas before we d idn't have 
to do that. Now, depending on your point of view, that's a grave defect, or it is, so 
what? Let's adopt the so what point of view. So, there's our prob lem. It's an initial 
value problem. How is it solved by the Lap lace transform? Well,  the idea is you take 
the Lap lace transform of this d ifferential equation and the initia l conditions. So, I'm 
going to exp lain to you how to do that. Not right now, because we're going to need, 
first, the Lap lace transform of a derivative, the formula  for that. You don't know that 
yet. But when you do know it, you will be able to take the Laplace transform of the 
initia l value prob lem. So, I'll put the  little l here, and what comes out is, well, y(t) is 
the solution to the orig inal prob lem. 

If y(t) is the function which satisfies that equation and these initia l conditions, its 
Laplace transform,  let's call it capital Y,  that's our standard notation, but it's going to 
be of a new variab le, s. So, when I take the Laplace transform of the d ifferentia l 
equation w ith the initial conditions, what comes out is an algebraic-- the emphasis is 
on a lgebra ic: no derivatives, no transcendental functions, nothing like that, an 
algebraic equation, m Y(s). 

And, now what? Well, now, in the domain of s, it's easy to solve this algebraic 
equation. Not all algebra ic equations are easy to solve for the capita l Y. But, the ones 
you will get will always be, not because I am making life easy for you, but that's the 
way the Laplace transform works. So, you will solve it for Y. And, the answer w ill 

always come out to be Y equa ls, Y(s) equa ls some rationa l function, some quotient of 
polynomials in s, a polynomia l in s d ivided by some other polynomia l in s. 

And, now what? Well, this is the Laplace transform of the answer. This is the Lap lace 
transform of the solution we are looking for. So, the fina l step is to go backwards by 
taking the inverse Lap lace transform of this guy. And, what will you get? Well, you 
will get y = y(t) that we are  looking for. It's really a w ild ly improbable procedure. In 
other words, instead of going from here to here, you have to imag ine there's a 
mountain here. And, the only way to get around it  is to go, first, here, and then 
cross the stream here, and then go back up, and go back up. It looks like a senseless 
procedure, what do they ca ll it, going around Robin Hood's barn, it was ca lled when I 
was a, I don't know why  it's ca lled that. 

But that's what we used to ca ll it; not Lap lace transform. That was just a generic 
thing when you had to do something like this. But, the answer is that it's hard to go 
from here to here, but trivia l to go from here to here. This solution step is the easiest 
step of a ll. This is not very hard. It's easy,  in fact. This is easy and straightforward. 
This is trivia l, essentially, yeah, trivial. But, this step is the hard step. This is where 
you have to use partial fractions, look up things in the tab le to get back there so that 
most of the work of the procedure isn't going from here to here. Going from here to 
there is a breeze. 

Okay, now, in order to imp lement this, what is it we have to do? Well, the basic thing 
is I have to exp lain to you, you already know at  least a little b it, a reasonable 
amount of technique for taking that step if you went to recitation yesterday and 
practiced a  little bit. This part, I assure you, is nothing. So, a ll I have to do now is 
exp lain to you how to take the Lap lace transform of the differentia l equation. And, 
that rea lly means, how do you take the Laplace transform of a derivative? 

So, that's our prob lem. What I want to form, in other words, is a formula  for the 
L(f'(t)). Now, in terms of what? Well, since f is an arbitrary function, the only thing I 
could hope for is somehow to express the Lap lace transform of the derivative in 
terms of the Laplace transform of the original function. So, that's what I'm a iming 
for. Okay, where are we going to start? Well, starting is easy because we know 
nothing. If you don't know anything, then there's no place to start but the definition. 
Since I know nothing whatever about the function f(t), and  I want to calculate the 
Laplace transform, I'd better start w ith the definition. 

Whatever this is, it's the Integral from 0 to infinity of [e^(-st) f'(t) dt]. Now, what 
am I looking for? I'm looking for somehow to transform this so  that what appears 
here is not f'(t), which I'm clueless about, but f(t) because if this were f of t, this 
expression would be the L(f(t). And, I'm assuming I know that. 

So, the question is how do I take this and somehow do something clever to it that 
turns this into  f(t) instead of f'(t)? Now, to first the question that way, I hope I would 
get 100% response on what to do. But, I'll go for 1%. So, what should I do? I want 
to change that, so that instead of f'(t), f(t) appears there instead. What should I do? 

Integrate by parts, the most fundamental procedure in advanced analysis. 
Everything important and interesting depends on integration by parts. And, when 
you consider that integration by parts is nothing more than just the formula  for the 
derivative of a product read backwards, it's amazing. It never fails to amaze me, but 

it's okay. That's what mathematics are so great. Okay, so let's use integration by 
parts. 

Integration by parts: okay, so, we have to decide, of course, there's no doubt that 
this is the factor we want to integrate, which means we have to be willing to 
differentiate this factor. But that w ill be okay because it looks practically,  like any 
exponentia l, it looks practically the same after you've differentiated it. So, let's do 
the work. First step is you don't do the differentiation. You only do the integration. 
So, the first step is e^(-st). 

And, the integral of f'(t) is just f(t). And, that's to be evaluated between the limits 
zero and infinity. And then, minus, aga in, before you forget  it, put down that minus 
sign. The integral between the limits of what you get by doing both operations, both 
the d ifferentiation and the integration. So, the d ifferentiation will be by using the 
cha in rule. Remember, I'm differentiating with respect to t. 

The variab le is t here, not s. s is just a parameter. It's just a constant, a variable 
constant,  if you get my meaning. That's not an oxymoron. A variable constant: a 
parameter is a variab le constant, variable because you can manipulate the  little 
slider and make a change its value, right? That's why it's variable. It's not a variab le. 
It's variab le, if you get the d istinction. Okay, well, I mean, it becomes a variable 
[LAUGHTER]. But right now, it's not a variab le. It's just sitting there in the integra l. 
All right, so, -s e^(-st) f(t) dt. Now, this part's easy. The interesting thing is this 
expression. So, and the most interesting thing is I have to eva luate it at infinity. 
Now, of course, that means take the  limit as you go towards, as you let t goes to 
infinity. 

Now, so what I'm interested in know ing is what's the limit of that expression? I'll 
write it as f(t) / e^(st). Remember, s is a positive number. s t goes to infinity, and I 
want to know what the limit of that is. Well, the  limit is what it is. But rea lly, if that 
limit isn't zero, I'm  in deep trouble since the whole process is out of control. What 
will make that limit zero? Well, that f(t) should not grow faster than e^(st) if s is a 
big enough number. And now, that's just what will happen if f of t is of exponentia l 
type. It's for this step right here that is the most crucial place at which we need to 
know that f of t is of exponentia l type. So, that limit is zero since f of t is of 
exponentia l type, in other words, that the value, the |f(t)|, becomes less than,  let's 
say, put in the c if you want, but it's not very important, c e^(kt) for a ll va lues of t. 

And, therefore,  this will go to zero as soon as s > k. In other words, if f(t) isn't 
grow ing any faster than e^(kt), then as soon as s is a number, that parameter has 
the value b igger than k, this ratio  is going to go  to zero because the denominator will 
always be bigger than the numerator, and getting bigger faster. So, this goes to zero 
if s > k. At the upper limit, therefore,  this is zero. Again, assuming that s is bigger 
than that k,  the k of the exponential type, how about at the lower limit? 

We're used to seeing zero there, but we're not going to get zero. If I p lug in t = 0, 
this factor becomes one. And, what happens to  that one? f(0). You mean, I'm going 
to have to know what f of zero is before I can take the Laplace transform of this 
derivative? The answer is yes, and that's why you have to have an initia l va lue 
problem. You have to know in advance what the va lue of the function that you are 
looking  for is at zero because it enters into the formula. I d idn't make up these rules; 
I'm just following them. So, what's the rest? The two negatives cancel, and you get 
+s. It's just a parameter, so I can pull it out of the integral. I'm integrating w ith 

respect to t, and what's left is, well, what is left? If I take out -s, combine it there, I 
get what's left is just the Laplace transform of the function I started w ith. 

So, it's F(s). And, that's the mag ic formula for the Laplace transform of the 
derivative. So, it's worth putting up on our little  list. So, f'(t), assuming it's of 
exponentia l type, has as its Lap lace transform, well, what  is it? Let's put down the 
major part of it is s times whatever the Lap lace transform of the orig ina l function, 
F(t), was. So, I take the origina l Laplace transform. When I multiply it by s, that 
corresponds to taking the derivative. But there's also that little extra piece. I must 
know the value of the starting va lue of the function. This is the formula you'll used to 
take a Lap lace transform of the differentia l equation. 

Now, but you see I'm not done yet because that will take care of the term a y'. But, I 
don't know what the Laplace transform of the second derivative is. Okay, so, we 
need a formula  for the Laplace transform of a second derivative as well as the first. 
Now, the hack method is to say, secondary, a ll right. I've got to do this. I'll second 
derivative here, second derivative here, what do I do with that? Ah-ha, I integrate by 
parts twice. Yes, you can do that. But that's a hack method. 

And, of course, I know you're too smart to do that. What you would do instead is--
How are we going to  fill that in? Well, a second derivative is a lso a first derivative. A 
second derivative  is the first derivative of the first derivative. Okay, now, we'll just 
call this glop, something. So, it's glop prime. What is the formula for the Laplace 
transform of glop prime? It is, well, I have my formula. It is the glop prime. The 
formula for it is s times the Laplace transform of glop, okay, g lop. Well, glop is f'(t). 
I'm not done yet, minus g lop eva luated at zero. What's glop eva luated at zero? Well, 
f'(0). 

Now, I don't want the formula in that form, but I have to have it in that form 
because I know what the Lap lace transform of f'(t) is. I just ca lculated that. So, this 
is equal to s times the Laplace transform of f prime of t, which is s times F of s, 
capital F of s, minus f of zero. All that bracket stuff corresponds to this guy. And, 
don't forget the stuff that's tagg ing along, minus -f'(0). And now, put that a ll 
together. What is  it going to be? Well, there's the principa l term which consists of 
s^2 F(s). That's the main part of it. And,  the rest is the sort of fellow travelers. So, 
we have -s f(0),  little term tagg ing along. This is a constant times s. 

And then, we've got another one, still another constant. So, what we have is to 
calculate the Laplace transform of the second derivative, I need to know both f(0) 
and f'(0), exactly the initial conditions that the problem was given for the initia l va lue 
problem. But, notice, there's a principal part of it. That's the s^2 F(s). That's the 
guts of it, so to speak. The rest of it, you know, you might hope that these two 
numbers are zero. It could happen, and often it  is made to happen and prob lems to 
simplify them. And I case, you don't have to worry; they're not there. But, if they 
are there, you must put them in or you get the wrong answer. So, that's the list of 
formulas. 

So, those formulas on the top board and these two extra ones, those are the things 
you will be working with on Friday. But I stress,  the Lap lace transform won't be a b ig 
part of the exam. The exam, of course, doesn't exist, let's say a maximum of 20%, 
maybe 15. I don't know, give or take a  few points. Yeah, what's a point or two? 
Okay, let's solve, yeah, we have time. We have time to solve a prob lem. Let's solve 
a problem. See, I can't touch that. It's untouchable. Okay, this, we've got to keep. 

Prob lem? Okay. Okay, now you know how to solve this problem by operators. Let me 
just briefly remind you of the basic steps. You have to do two separate tasks. You 
have to first solve the homogeneous equation, putting a zero there. That's the first 
thing you  learned to do. That's easy. You could almost do that in your head now. You 
get the characteristic polynomial, get its roots, get the two functions, e^t and e^(-
t), which are the solutions. You make up c1 times one, and c2 times the other. 
That's the complementary function that solves the homogeneous prob lem. And then 
you have to find a particular solution. Can you see what would happen if you try to 
find the particular solution? The number here is negative one, right? 

Negative one is a root of the characteristic polynomia l, so you've got to use that 
extra formula. It's okay. That's why I gave  it to you. You've used the exponential 
input theorem with the extra formula. Then, you will get the particular solution. And 
now, you have to make the general solution. The particular solution plus the 
complementary function, and now you are ready to put in the initia l conditions. 

At the very end, when you've got the whole general solution, now you put in, not 
before, you put in the  initia l conditions. You have to calculate the derivative of that 
thing and substitute this. You take it as it stands to substitute this. You get a pa ir of 
simultaneous equations for c1 and c2. You solve them: answer. It's a  rather 
elaborate procedure, which has at least three or four separate steps, all of which, of 
course, must be done correctly. 

Now, the Laplace transform, instead, feeds the entire prob lem into the Lap lace 
transform machine. You  follow that little b lue pattern, and you come out w ith the 
answer. So,  let's do the Laplace transform way. Okay, so, the first step is to say, if 
here's my unknown function, y(t), it obeys this law, and here are its starting va lues, 
a bit of its derivative. What I'm going to take is the Lap lace transform of this 
equation. In other words, I'll take the Lap lace transform of this side, and this side 
also. And, they must be equal because  if they were equa l to start with, the Lap lace 
transforms also have to be equa l. Okay, so let's take the Laplace transform of this 
equation. Okay, first ID the Laplace transform of the second derivative. Okay, that's 
going to be, don't forget the principal terms. 

There  is some people who get so hypnotized by this. I just know I'm going to forget 
this. So, they read it. Then they forget this. But that's everything. That's the 
important part. Okay, so it's s times, I'm ca lling  the Lap lace transform not capita l F 
but capital Y because my origina l function is ca lled little y. So, it's s^2 Y. It's Y(s), 
but I'm not going to put that, the of s in because it just makes the thing look more 
complicated. 

And now, before you  forget, you have to put in the rest. So, minus s times the value 
at zero, which is one, minus the va lue of the derivative. But, that's zero. So, this is 
not too hard a problem. So, -s - 0, so I don't have to put that in. So, all this is the 
Laplace transform of y''. And now, -L(y), well, that's just cap ital Y. 

What's that equal to? The Lap lace transform of the right-hand side. Okay, look up 
the formula. It is e^(-t), a is minus one, so, it's 1 / (s - (-1)); so, it is s + 1. This is 
that. Okay, the next thing we have to do is solve for Y. That doesn't look too hard. 
Solve it for y. Okay, the best thing to do is put s squared, group all the Y terms 
together unless you're really quite a good ca lculator. Maybe make one extra line out 
of it. Yeah, definitely do this. And then, the extra garbage I refer to as the garbage, 

this stuff, and this stuff, the stuff, the linear polynomia ls which are tagg ing along 
move to the right-hand side because they don't  involve capital Y. 

So, this we will move to the other side. And so, that's equal to 1 / (s + 1) + s. Now, 
you have a basic choice. About ha lf the time, it's a good idea to comb ine these 
terms. The other ha lf of the time, it's not a good idea to comb ine those terms. So, 
how do we know whether to do it or not to do it? Experience, which you w ill get by 
solving many, many problems. Okay, I'm going  to combine them because I think it's 
a good thing to do here. 

So, what  is that? That's s^2 + s + 1. So,  it's s squared plus s plus one d ivided by s 
plus one, okay? I'm still not done because now we have to know, what's Y? All right, 
now we have to think. What we're going to do is get Y in this form. But, I want it in 
the form  in which it's most suited for using partial fractions. In other words, I want 
the denominator as factored as I possib ly can be. Okay, well,  the numerator is going 
to be just what it was. How should  I write the denominator? Well, the denominator is 
going to have the factor s + 1 in it from here. 

But after I d ivide through, the other factor will be s^2 - 1, right? But, s^2 - 1 = (s -
1)(s + 1). So, I have to d ivide this by s^2 - 1. Factored, it's this. So, the end result 
is there are two of these and one of the other. And now, it's ready to be used. It's 
better to be a partial fraction. So, the final step is to use a partial fraction's 
decomposition on this so that you can calculate its inverse Lap lace transform. So, 
let's do  that. Okay, (s^2 + s + 1) / ((s + 1)^2 (s - 1)) equals (s + 1)^2 p lus s + 1 
plus (s - 1). 

In the top w ill be constants, just constants. Let's do it this way first, and I'll say at 
the very end, something else. Maybe now. Many of you are upset. Some of you are 
upset. I know this for a  fact because in high school, or wherever you learned to do 
this before, there weren't two terms here. There was just one term, (s + 1)^2. If 
you do it that way, then it's all right. Then, it's a ll right, but I don't recommend  it. In 
that case, the numerators will not be constants. But,  if you just have that, then 
because this is a quadratic polynomia l a ll by itself. You've got to have a linear 
polynomial, as + b in the top, see? 

So, you must have as + b here, as I'm sure you remember if that's the way you 
learned to do it. But, to do cover-up, the best way as much as possible to separate 
out the terms. If this were a cub ic term, God forbid, (s + 1)^3, then you'd have to 
have (s + 1)^3, (s + 1)^2, s + 1. Okay, I won't give you anything b igger than 
quadratic. [LAUGHTER] 

You can trust me. Okay, now, what can we find by the cover up method? Well, surely 
this. Cover up the s - 1, put s = 1, and I get 3 / 2^2 = 3 / 4. Now, in this, you can 
always find the highest power by cover-up because, cover it up, put s = -1, and you 
get 1 - 1 + 1. 

So, one up there, negative one here makes negative two here. So, 1 / -2. So, it's -
1/2. Now, this you cannot determine by cover-up because you'd want to cover-up 
just one of these (s + 1). But then you can't put s = -1 because you get infinity. You 
get zero there, makes infinity. So, this must be determined some other way, either 
by undetermined coefficients, or if you've just got one thing, for heaven's sake, just 
make a substitution. 

See, this is supposed to be true. This is an a lgebraic identity, true for a ll va lues of 
the variab le, and therefore, it ought to be true when s = 0, for instance. Why zero? 
Well, because I haven't used it yet. I used negative one and positive one, but I didn't 
use zero. Okay, let's use zero. Put s equa ls zero. What do we get? Well, on the left-
hand side, I get one d ivided by one squared, negative. So, I get minus one on the 
left hand side equals, what do I get on the right? Put s = 0, you get -1/2. Well, this 
is the number I'm trying to  find. So, let's write that simply as p lus c, putting s equals 
zero. s equa ls zero here gives me -3/4. Okay, what's c? This is 1/2 - 3/4 = -5/4. Put 
it on the other side, -1 + 5/4 = +1/4. 

So, c = 1/4. And now, we are ready to do the final step. Take the inverse Laplace 
transform. You see what I said when I said that all the work is in this last step? Just 
look how much of the work, how much of the board is devoted to the first two steps, 
and how much is going to be devoted to the last step? Okay, so we get e to the 
inverse Lap lace transform. Well, the first term is the hardest. Let's let that go for the 
moment. So, I leave a space for it, and then we will have one quarter. Well, 1 / (s + 
1) is, that's just the exponential formula. One over s p lus one would be e to the 
negative t, e^(-1*t). So, it's 1/4 e^(-1*t). 

And, how about the next thing would be three quarters times, well, here it's negative 
one, so that's e^(+t). Notice how those signs work. And,  that just leaves us the 
Laplace transform of this thing. Now, you look at it and you say, this Lap lace 
transform happened in two steps. I took something and I got, essentia lly, 1 / s^2. 
And then, I changed s --> s + 1. All right, what gives 1 / s^2? The Lap lace 
transform of what is one over s squared? t, you say to yourself, one over s to some 
power is essentially some power of t. And then, you look at the formula. 

Notice at the top  is one factoria l, which  is one, of course. Okay, now, then how do I 
convert this to 1 / (s + 1)^2? That's the exponentia l shift formula. If you know what 
the Lap lace transform, so the first formula in the midd le of the board on the top, 
there, if you know what, change s --> s + 1, corresponds to multiplying by e^t. 

So, it is t e^(-t). Sorry, that corresponds to this. So, this is the exponentia l shift 
formula. If 1 / s^2, then t e^(-t) goes to 1 / (s + 1)^2. Okay, but there's a constant 
out front. So, it's -1/2 t e^(-t). Now, tell me, what parts of this solution, oh boy, 
we're over time. But, notice, this is what would have been the particular solution, 
(y)p before, and this is the stuff that occurs in the comp lementary function, but 
already the appropriate constants have been supplied for the coefficients. 

You don't have to ca lculate them separately. They were built into the method. Okay, 
good luck on Friday, and see you there.
