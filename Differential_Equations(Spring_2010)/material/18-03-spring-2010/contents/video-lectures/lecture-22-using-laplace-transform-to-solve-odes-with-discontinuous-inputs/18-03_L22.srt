1
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
Today we are going to do a last
serious topic on the Laplace

2
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
transform, the last topic for
which I don't have to make

3
00:00:19 --> 00:00:25
frequent and profuse apologies.
One of the things the Laplace

4
00:00:24 --> 00:00:30
transform does very well and one
of the reasons why people like

5
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
it, engineers like it,
is that it handles functions

6
00:00:33 --> 00:00:39
with jump discontinuities very
nicely.

7
00:00:37 --> 00:00:43

8
00:00:47 --> 00:00:53
Now, the OR function with a
jump discontinuity is-- Purple.

9
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
Is a function called the unit
step function.

10
00:01:00 --> 00:01:06
I will draw a graph of it.
Even the graph is

11
00:01:03 --> 00:01:09
controversial,
but everyone is agreed that it

12
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
zero here and one there.
What people are not agreed upon

13
00:01:12 --> 00:01:18
is its value at zero.
And some people make it zero,

14
00:01:16 --> 00:01:22
some people make it one,
and some equivocate like me.

15
00:01:20 --> 00:01:26
I will leave it undefined.
It is u of t.

16
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
It is called the unit step.

17
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34

18
00:01:32 --> 00:01:38
Because that is what it is.
And let's say we will leave u

19
00:01:35 --> 00:01:41
of zero undefined.

20
00:01:38 --> 00:01:44

21
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
If that makes you unhappy,
get over it.

22
00:01:46 --> 00:01:52
Of course, we don't always want
the jump to be at zero.

23
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
Sometimes we will want to jump
in another place.

24
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
If I want the function to jump,
let's say at the point a

25
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
instead of jumping at zero,
I am going to start doing what

26
00:02:05 --> 00:02:11
everybody does.
You put in the vertical lines,

27
00:02:10 --> 00:02:16
even though I have no meaning,
whatever, but it makes the

28
00:02:15 --> 00:02:21
graph look more connected and a
little easier to read.

29
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
So that function I will call u
sub a is the function

30
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
which jumps at the point a.
How shall I give its

31
00:02:28 --> 00:02:34
definition?
Well, you can see it is just

32
00:02:32 --> 00:02:38
the translation by a of the unit
step function.

33
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
So that is the way to write it,
u of t minus a.

34
00:02:42 --> 00:02:48
Now I am not done.
There is a unit box function,

35
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
which we will draw in general
terms like this.

36
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
It gets to a,
then it jumps up to one,

37
00:02:54 --> 00:03:00
falls down again at b and
continues onto zero.

38
00:03:00 --> 00:03:06
This happens between a and b.
And the value to which it

39
00:03:04 --> 00:03:10
arises is one.
I will call this the unit box.

40
00:03:09 --> 00:03:15

41
00:03:17 --> 00:03:23
It is a function of t,
a very simple one but an

42
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
important one.
And what would be the formula

43
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
for the unit box function?
Well, in general,

44
00:03:26 --> 00:03:32
almost all of these functions,
as you will see when you use

45
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
jump discontinuity,
the idea is to write them all

46
00:03:33 --> 00:03:39
cleverly using nothing but u of.

47
00:03:37 --> 00:03:43
Because it is that will have
the Laplace transformer.

48
00:03:41 --> 00:03:47
The way to write this is (u)ab.

49
00:03:43 --> 00:03:49
And, if you like,
you can treat this as the

50
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
definition of it.
Let's make it a definition.

51
00:03:50 --> 00:03:56
Okay, three lines.
Or, better yet,

52
00:03:53 --> 00:03:59
a colon and two lines.
I am defining this to be,

53
00:03:57 --> 00:04:03
what would it be?
Make the unit step at a step up

54
00:04:02 --> 00:04:08
at a, but then I would continue
at one all the time.

55
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
I should, therefore,
step down at b.

56
00:04:10 --> 00:04:16
Now, the way you step down is
just by taking the negative of

57
00:04:15 --> 00:04:21
the unit step function.
I step down at b by subtracting

58
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
u sub b of t .
In other words,

59
00:04:24 --> 00:04:30
it is u of t minus a minus u of
t minus b.

60
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
And now I have expressed it

61
00:04:32 --> 00:04:38
entirely in terms of the unit
step function.

62
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
That will be convenient when I
want take the Laplace transform.

63
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
What is so good about these
things?

64
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
Well, these functions,
when you use them in

65
00:04:43 --> 00:04:49
multiplications,
they transform other functions

66
00:04:46 --> 00:04:52
in a nice way.
Not transform.

67
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
That is not the right word.
They operate on them.

68
00:04:51 --> 00:04:57
They turn them into other
strange creatures,

69
00:04:53 --> 00:04:59
and it might be these strange
creatures that you are

70
00:04:56 --> 00:05:02
interested in.
Let me just draw you a picture.

71
00:05:01 --> 00:05:07
That will be good enough.
Suppose we have some function

72
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
like that, f of t,
what would the function u sub

73
00:05:12 --> 00:05:18
ab,
I will put in the variable,

74
00:05:16 --> 00:05:22
t times f of t,
what function would that be?

75
00:05:21 --> 00:05:27
I am just going to draw its
graph.

76
00:05:24 --> 00:05:30
What would its graph be?
Well, in between a and b this

77
00:05:30 --> 00:05:36
function (u)ab of t has the
value one.

78
00:05:34 --> 00:05:40
All I am doing is multiplying f
of t by one.

79
00:05:39 --> 00:05:45
In short, I am not doing
anything to it at all.

80
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
Outside of that interval,
(u)ab has the value zero,

81
00:05:47 --> 00:05:53
so that zero times f of t makes
zero.

82
00:05:51 --> 00:05:57
And, therefore,
outside of this it is zero.

83
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
The effect of multiplying an
arbitrary function by this unit

84
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
box function is,
you wipe away all of its graph

85
00:06:03 --> 00:06:09
except the part between a and b.
Now, that is a very useful

86
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
thing to be able to do.
Well, that is enough of that.

87
00:06:14 --> 00:06:20
Now, let's get into the main
topic.

88
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
That is just preliminary.
I will be using these functions

89
00:06:22 --> 00:06:28
all during the period,
but the real topic is the

90
00:06:25 --> 00:06:31
following.
Let's calculate the Laplace

91
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
transform of the unit step
function.

92
00:06:33 --> 00:06:39
Well, this is no very big deal.
It is the integral from zero to

93
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
infinity e to the minus s t
times y of t, dt.

94
00:06:41 --> 00:06:47

95
00:06:45 --> 00:06:51
But, look, when t is bigger
than zero,

96
00:06:49 --> 00:06:55
this has the value one.
So it is the same of the

97
00:06:53 --> 00:06:59
Laplace transform of one.
In other words,

98
00:06:56 --> 00:07:02
it is one over s for
positive values of s.

99
00:07:02 --> 00:07:08
Or, to make it very clear,
the Laplace transform of one is

100
00:07:06 --> 00:07:12
exactly the same thing.
As you see, the Laplace

101
00:07:09 --> 00:07:15
transform really is not
interested in what happens when

102
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
t is less than zero
because that is not part of the

103
00:07:17 --> 00:07:23
domain of integration,
the interval of integration.

104
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
That is fine.
They both have Laplace

105
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
transform of one over s.

106
00:07:26 --> 00:07:32
What is the big deal?
The big deal is,

107
00:07:30 --> 00:07:36
what is the inverse Laplace
transform of one over s?

108
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
Will the real function please

109
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47
stand up?
Which of these two should I

110
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
pick?
Up to now in the course we have

111
00:07:49 --> 00:07:55
been picking one just because I
never made a fuss over it and

112
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
one was good enough.
For today one is no longer

113
00:08:01 --> 00:08:07
going to be good enough.
And we have to first

114
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
investigate the thing in a
slightly more theoretical way

115
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
because this problem,
I have illustrated it on the

116
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
inverse Laplace transform of one
over x,

117
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
but it occurs for any inverse
Laplace transform.

118
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
Suppose I have,
in other words,

119
00:08:23 --> 00:08:29
that a function f of t has as
its Laplace transform capital F

120
00:08:27 --> 00:08:33
of s?
And now, I ask what the inverse

121
00:08:32 --> 00:08:38
Laplace transform of capital F
of s is.

122
00:08:37 --> 00:08:43
Well, of course you want to
write f of t.

123
00:08:41 --> 00:08:47
But the same thing happens.
I will draw you a picture.

124
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
Suppose, in other words,
that here is our function f of

125
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
t.
Well, one answer certainly is f

126
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
of t.
That is okay.

127
00:08:54 --> 00:09:00
That is the answer we have been
using up until now.

128
00:09:00 --> 00:09:06
But, you see,
I can complete this function in

129
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10
many other ways.
Suppose I haven't told you what

130
00:09:08 --> 00:09:14
it was for s less than zero.
Any of these possibilities all

131
00:09:14 --> 00:09:20
will produce the same Laplace
transform.

132
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
In fact, I can even make it
this.

133
00:09:20 --> 00:09:26
That is okay.
Each of these,

134
00:09:23 --> 00:09:29
f of t with any one of
these tails, all have the same

135
00:09:28 --> 00:09:34
Laplace transform.

136
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38

137
00:09:37 --> 00:09:43
Because the Laplace transform,
remember the definition,

138
00:09:41 --> 00:09:47
integral zero to infinity,
e to the negative s t,

139
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
f of t, dt

140
00:09:49 --> 00:09:55
because the Laplace transform
does not care what the function

141
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
was doing for negative values of
t.

142
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
Now, if we have to have a
unique answer --

143
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
And most of the time you don't
because, in general,

144
00:10:03 --> 00:10:09
the Laplace transform is only
used for problems for future

145
00:10:07 --> 00:10:13
time.
That is the way the engineers

146
00:10:09 --> 00:10:15
and physicists and other people
who use it habitually think of

147
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
it.
If your problem is starting now

148
00:10:15 --> 00:10:21
and going on into the future and
you don't have to know anything

149
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
about the past,
that is a Laplace transform

150
00:10:23 --> 00:10:29
problem.
If you also have to know about

151
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
the past, then it is a Fourier
transform problem.

152
00:10:30 --> 00:10:36
That is beyond the scope of
this course, you will never hear

153
00:10:34 --> 00:10:40
that word again,
but that is the difference.

154
00:10:37 --> 00:10:43
We are starting at time zero
and going forward.

155
00:10:41 --> 00:10:47
All right.
It does not care what f of t

156
00:10:44 --> 00:10:50
was doing for negative values of
t.

157
00:10:46 --> 00:10:52
And that gives us a problem
when we try to make the Laplace

158
00:10:51 --> 00:10:57
transform unique.
Now, how will I make it unique?

159
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
Well, there is a simple way of
doing it.

160
00:10:59 --> 00:11:05
Let's agree that wherever it
makes a difference,

161
00:11:02 --> 00:11:08
and most of the time it
doesn't, but today it will,

162
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
whenever it makes a difference
we will declare,

163
00:11:09 --> 00:11:15
we will by brute force make our
function zero for negative

164
00:11:14 --> 00:11:20
values of t.
That makes it unique.

165
00:11:16 --> 00:11:22
I am going to say that to make
it unique, now,

166
00:11:20 --> 00:11:26
how do I make f of t zero
for negative values

167
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
of t?
The answer is multiply it by

168
00:11:27 --> 00:11:33
the unit step function.
That leaves it what it was.

169
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
It multiplies it by one for
positive values but multiplies

170
00:11:37 --> 00:11:43
it by zero for negative values.
The answer is going to be u of

171
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
t times f of t.
That will be the function that

172
00:11:48 --> 00:11:54
will look just that way that I
drew, but I will draw it once

173
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
more.
It is the function that looks

174
00:11:56 --> 00:12:02
like this.
And when I do this,

175
00:11:58 --> 00:12:04
it makes the inverse Laplace
transform unique.

176
00:12:04 --> 00:12:10
Out of all the possible tails I
might have put on f of t,

177
00:12:08 --> 00:12:14
it picks the least
interesting one,

178
00:12:11 --> 00:12:17
the tail zero.

179
00:12:13 --> 00:12:19

180
00:12:23 --> 00:12:29
That is a start.
But what we have to do now is

181
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
--

182
00:12:27 --> 00:12:33

183
00:12:35 --> 00:12:41
What I want is a formula.
What we are going to need is,

184
00:12:38 --> 00:12:44
as you see right even in the
beginning, if for example,

185
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
if I want to calculate the
Laplace transform of this,

186
00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
what I would like to have is a
nice Laplace transform for the

187
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
translate.
If you translate a function,

188
00:12:52 --> 00:12:58
how does that effect this
Laplace transform?

189
00:12:55 --> 00:13:01
In other words,
the formula I am looking for is

190
00:12:58 --> 00:13:04
--

191
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06

192
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
I want to express the Laplace
transform of f of t minus a.

193
00:13:12 --> 00:13:18
In other words,

194
00:13:15 --> 00:13:21
the function translated,
let's say a is positive,

195
00:13:19 --> 00:13:25
so I translate it to the right
along the t axis by the distance

196
00:13:25 --> 00:13:31
a.
I want a formula for this in

197
00:13:27 --> 00:13:33
terms of the Laplace transform
of the function I started with.

198
00:13:34 --> 00:13:40
Now, my first task is to
convince you that,

199
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
though this would be very
useful and interesting,

200
00:13:40 --> 00:13:46
there cannot possibly be such a
formula.

201
00:13:43 --> 00:13:49
There is no such formula.

202
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52

203
00:13:56 --> 00:14:02
Why not?
Well, I think I will explain it

204
00:13:59 --> 00:14:05
over there since there is a
little piece of board I did not

205
00:14:05 --> 00:14:11
use.
Waste not want not.

206
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
Why can't there be such a
formula?

207
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
What is it we are looking for?
Let's take a nice average

208
00:14:15 --> 00:14:21
function f of t.
It has a Laplace transform.

209
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
And now I am going to translate
it.

210
00:14:23 --> 00:14:29
Let's say this is the point
negative a.

211
00:14:29 --> 00:14:35
And so the corresponding point
positive a will be around here.

212
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
I am going to translate it to
the right by a.

213
00:14:38 --> 00:14:44
What is it going to look like?
Well, then it is going to start

214
00:14:43 --> 00:14:49
here and is going to look like
this dashy thing.

215
00:14:48 --> 00:14:54
That is f of t minus a.

216
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
That is not too bad a picture.
It will do.

217
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00
I just took that curve and
shoved it to the right by a.

218
00:15:01 --> 00:15:07
Now, why is it impossible to
express the Laplace transform of

219
00:15:09 --> 00:15:15
the dashed line in terms of the
Laplace transform of the solid

220
00:15:18 --> 00:15:24
line?
The answer is this piece.

221
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
I will write it this way.
The trouble is,

222
00:15:28 --> 00:15:34
this piece is not used for the
Laplace transform of f of t.

223
00:15:37 --> 00:15:43
Why isn't it used?

224
00:15:41 --> 00:15:47
Well, because it occurs to the
left of the vertical axis.

225
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
It occurs for negative values
of t.

226
00:15:47 --> 00:15:53
And the Laplace transform of f
of t simply does not

227
00:15:51 --> 00:15:57
care what f of t was
doing to the left of that line,

228
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01
for negative values of t.
It does not enter into the

229
00:15:58 --> 00:16:04
integral.
It was not used when I

230
00:16:01 --> 00:16:07
calculated this piece of the
curve.

231
00:16:04 --> 00:16:10
It was not used when I
calculated the Laplace transform

232
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
of f of t.
On the other hand,

233
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
it is going to be needed.
It occurs here,

234
00:16:13 --> 00:16:19
after I shift it to the right.
It is going to be needed for

235
00:16:17 --> 00:16:23
the Laplace transform of f of t
minus a,

236
00:16:21 --> 00:16:27
because I will have to start
the integration here,

237
00:16:25 --> 00:16:31
and I will have to know what
that is.

238
00:16:29 --> 00:16:35

239
00:16:34 --> 00:16:40
In other words,
when I took the Laplace

240
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43
transform, I automatically lost
all information about the

241
00:16:41 --> 00:16:47
function for negative values of
t.

242
00:16:44 --> 00:16:50
If I am later going to want
some of that information for

243
00:16:48 --> 00:16:54
calculating this,
I won't have it and,

244
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
therefore, there cannot be a
formula expressing one in terms

245
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
of the other.
Now, of course,

246
00:16:59 --> 00:17:05
that cannot be the answer,
otherwise I would not have

247
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
raised your expectations merely
to dash them.

248
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
I don't want to do that,
of course.

249
00:17:07 --> 00:17:13
There is a formula,
of course.

250
00:17:09 --> 00:17:15
It is just, I want to emphasize
that you must write it my way

251
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
because, if you write it any
other way, you are going to get

252
00:17:17 --> 00:17:23
into the deepest trouble.
The formula is-- the good

253
00:17:21 --> 00:17:27
formula, the right formula --

254
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30

255
00:17:30 --> 00:17:36
-- accepts the given.
It says look,

256
00:17:32 --> 00:17:38
we have lost that pink part of
it.

257
00:17:35 --> 00:17:41
Therefore, I can never recover
that.

258
00:17:37 --> 00:17:43
Therefore, I won't ask for it.
The translation formula I will

259
00:17:42 --> 00:17:48
ask for is not one for the
Laplace transform of f of t

260
00:17:46 --> 00:17:52
minus a,
but rather for the Laplace

261
00:17:50 --> 00:17:56
transform of this thing where I
have wiped away that pink part

262
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
from the translated function.
In other words,

263
00:17:59 --> 00:18:05
the function I am talking about
now is the formula for,

264
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
I will put it over here to show
you the function what we are

265
00:18:10 --> 00:18:16
talking about.
It is the function f of,

266
00:18:13 --> 00:18:19
well, in terms of the pink
function it is,

267
00:18:17 --> 00:18:23
I will have to reproduce some
of that picture.

268
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
There is f of t.
f of t minus a,

269
00:18:26 --> 00:18:32
then, looked like this.
And so the function I am

270
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
looking for is,
this is the thing translated,

271
00:18:36 --> 00:18:42
but when I get down to the
corresponding,

272
00:18:39 --> 00:18:45
this is the point that
corresponds to that one,

273
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
I wipe it away and just go with
zero after that.

274
00:18:48 --> 00:18:54
So this is u of t minus a times
f of t minus a times f of t

275
00:18:53 --> 00:18:59
minus a.
What is this Laplace transform?

276
00:19:00 --> 00:19:06
Now that does have a simple
answer.

277
00:19:04 --> 00:19:10
The answer is it is e to the
minus as,

278
00:19:10 --> 00:19:16
a funny exponential,
times the Laplace transform of

279
00:19:16 --> 00:19:22
the original function.
Now, this formula occurs in two

280
00:19:23 --> 00:19:29
forms.
This one is not too bad

281
00:19:26 --> 00:19:32
looking.
The trouble is,

282
00:19:29 --> 00:19:35
when you want to solve
differential equations you are

283
00:19:33 --> 00:19:39
going to be extremely puzzled
because the function that you

284
00:19:37 --> 00:19:43
will have to take to do the
calculation on will not be given

285
00:19:41 --> 00:19:47
to you in the form f of t minus
a.

286
00:19:44 --> 00:19:50
It will look sine t
or t squared or some

287
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
polynomial in t.
It will not be written as t

288
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
minus a.
What do you do?

289
00:19:53 --> 00:19:59
If your function does not look
like that but instead,

290
00:19:56 --> 00:20:02
in terms of symbols looks like
this, you can still use the

291
00:20:00 --> 00:20:06
formula.
Just a trivial change of

292
00:20:03 --> 00:20:09
variable means that you can
write it instead.

293
00:20:06 --> 00:20:12
Now, this is one place,
there is no way of writing the

294
00:20:10 --> 00:20:16
answer in terms of capital F of
s.

295
00:20:13 --> 00:20:19
This is one of those cases
where this notation is just no

296
00:20:17 --> 00:20:23
good anymore.
I am going to have to write it

297
00:20:20 --> 00:20:26
using the L notation.
The Laplace transform of f of,

298
00:20:24 --> 00:20:30
and wherever you see a t,
you should write t plus a.

299
00:20:28 --> 00:20:34
Basically, this is the same

300
00:20:31 --> 00:20:37
formula as that one.
But I will have to stand on my

301
00:20:35 --> 00:20:41
head for one minute to try to
convince you of it.

302
00:20:38 --> 00:20:44
I won't do that now.
I would like you just to take a

303
00:20:42 --> 00:20:48
look at the formula.
You should know what it is

304
00:20:45 --> 00:20:51
called.
There are a certain number of

305
00:20:48 --> 00:20:54
idiots who call this the
exponential shift formula

306
00:20:51 --> 00:20:57
because on the right side you
multiply by an exponential,

307
00:20:55 --> 00:21:01
and that corresponds to
shifting the function.

308
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
Unfortunately,
we have preempted that.

309
00:21:02 --> 00:21:08
We are not going to call it
this.

310
00:21:05 --> 00:21:11
I will call it what your book
calls it.

311
00:21:08 --> 00:21:14
The difficulty is there is no
universal designation for this

312
00:21:13 --> 00:21:19
formula, important as it is.
However, your book calls this

313
00:21:17 --> 00:21:23
t-axis translation formula.
Translation because I am

314
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
translating on the t-axis.
And that is what I do to the

315
00:21:25 --> 00:21:31
function, essentially.
And this tells me what its new

316
00:21:30 --> 00:21:36
Laplace transform is.

317
00:21:33 --> 00:21:39

318
00:21:38 --> 00:21:44
The other formula,
remember it?

319
00:21:40 --> 00:21:46
The exponential shift formula,
the shift or the translation

320
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
occurs on the s-axis.
In other words,

321
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
the formula said that F of s
minus a,

322
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
you do the translation in s
variable corresponded to

323
00:21:55 --> 00:22:01
multiplying this by e
to the a t.

324
00:22:00 --> 00:22:06
In other words,
the formulas are sort of dual

325
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
to each other.
This guy translates on the left

326
00:22:05 --> 00:22:11
side and multiplies by the
exponential on the right.

327
00:22:08 --> 00:22:14
The formula that you know
translates on the right and

328
00:22:12 --> 00:22:18
multiplies by the exponential on
the left.

329
00:22:14 --> 00:22:20
What are we going to calculate?
I am trying to calculate,

330
00:22:18 --> 00:22:24
so I am trying to prove this
first formula.

331
00:22:20 --> 00:22:26
The second one will be an easy
consequence.

332
00:22:23 --> 00:22:29
I am trying to calculate the
Laplace transform of that thing.

333
00:22:27 --> 00:22:33
What is it?
Well, it is the integral from

334
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
zero to infinity of e to the
minus st times u of t minus a,

335
00:22:35 --> 00:22:41
f of t minus a times dt.

336
00:22:39 --> 00:22:45

337
00:22:42 --> 00:22:48
That is the formula for it.
But I am trying to express it

338
00:22:46 --> 00:22:52
in terms of the Laplace
transform of f itself.

339
00:22:49 --> 00:22:55
Now, it is trying to be the
Laplace transform of f.

340
00:22:54 --> 00:23:00
The problem is that here,
a (t minus a) occurs,

341
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
which I don't like.
I would like that to be just a

342
00:23:03 --> 00:23:09
t.
Now, in order not to confuse

343
00:23:05 --> 00:23:11
you, and this is what confused
everybody, I will set t1 equal

344
00:23:09 --> 00:23:15
to t minus a.
I will change the variable.

345
00:23:13 --> 00:23:19
This is called changing the
variable in a definite integral.

346
00:23:17 --> 00:23:23
How do you change the variable
in a definite integral?

347
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
You do it.
Well, let's leave the limits

348
00:23:24 --> 00:23:30
for the moment.
e to the minus s

349
00:23:27 --> 00:23:33
times --
Now, t, remember you can change

350
00:23:31 --> 00:23:37
the variable forwards,
direct substitution,

351
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
but now I have to use the
inverse substitution.

352
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
It's trivial,
but t is equal to t1 plus a.

353
00:23:40 --> 00:23:46
To change this I must

354
00:23:42 --> 00:23:48
substitute backwards and make
that t1 plus a.

355
00:23:45 --> 00:23:51
How about the rest of it?
Well, this becomes u of t1.

356
00:23:49 --> 00:23:55
This is f of t1.

357
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
I have to change the dt,
too, but that's no problem.

358
00:23:55 --> 00:24:01
dt1 equals dt
because a is a constant.

359
00:24:00 --> 00:24:06
That is dt1.
And the last step is to put in

360
00:24:03 --> 00:24:09
the limits.
Now, when t is equal to zero,

361
00:24:06 --> 00:24:12
t1 has the value
negative a.

362
00:24:10 --> 00:24:16
So this has to be negative a
when t is infinity.

363
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
Infinity minus a is still
infinity, so that is still

364
00:24:17 --> 00:24:23
infinity.
In other words,

365
00:24:19 --> 00:24:25
this changes to that.
These two things,

366
00:24:22 --> 00:24:28
whatever they are,
they have the same value.

367
00:24:25 --> 00:24:31
All I have done is changed the
variable.

368
00:24:30 --> 00:24:36
Make it change a variable.
But now, of course,

369
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
I want to make this look
better.

370
00:24:34 --> 00:24:40
How am I going to do that?
Well, first multiply out the

371
00:24:37 --> 00:24:43
exponential and then you get a
factor e to the minus s(t1).

372
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
That is good.

373
00:24:42 --> 00:24:48
That goes with this guy.
Now I get a factor e to the

374
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
minus s times a from
the exponential law.

375
00:24:47 --> 00:24:53
But that does not have anything
to do with the integral.

376
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
It is a constant as far as the
integral is concerned because it

377
00:24:54 --> 00:25:00
doesn't involve t1.
And, therefore,

378
00:24:56 --> 00:25:02
I can pull it outside of the
integral sign.

379
00:25:00 --> 00:25:06
And write that e to the minus s
times a.

380
00:25:05 --> 00:25:11
Let's write it the other way.
Times the integral of what?

381
00:25:10 --> 00:25:16
Well, e to the negative st1.

382
00:25:14 --> 00:25:20
Now, u of t1,
f of t1 times dt1.

383
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
Still integrated from minus a

384
00:25:22 --> 00:25:28
to infinity.
And now the final step.

385
00:25:29 --> 00:25:35
This u of t1 is zero
for negative values of t.

386
00:25:34 --> 00:25:40
And, therefore,
it is equal to one for positive

387
00:25:38 --> 00:25:44
values of t.
It is equal to zero for

388
00:25:42 --> 00:25:48
negative values of t,
which means I can forget about

389
00:25:47 --> 00:25:53
the part of the integral that
goes from negative a to zero.

390
00:25:52 --> 00:25:58
I better rewrite this.

391
00:25:56 --> 00:26:02
Okay, leave that.
In other words,

392
00:26:00 --> 00:26:06
this is equal to e to the minus
as times the

393
00:26:04 --> 00:26:10
integral from zero to infinity
of e to the minus s --

394
00:26:08 --> 00:26:14
Let me do the shifty part now.

395
00:26:11 --> 00:26:17

396
00:26:17 --> 00:26:23
And this is since u of t1 is
equal to zero for

397
00:26:23 --> 00:26:29
t1 less than zero.
That is why I can replace this

398
00:26:29 --> 00:26:35
with zero.
Because from negative a to

399
00:26:33 --> 00:26:39
zero, nothing is happening.
The integrand is zero.

400
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
And why can I get rid of it
after that?

401
00:26:40 --> 00:26:46
Well, because it is one after
that.

402
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
And what is this thing?
This is the Laplace transform.

403
00:26:47 --> 00:26:53
No, it is not the Laplace
transform they said.

404
00:26:51 --> 00:26:57
Because you had t1 there,
not t.

405
00:26:53 --> 00:26:59
It is the Laplace transform
because this is a dummy

406
00:26:58 --> 00:27:04
variable.
The t1 is integrated out.

407
00:27:01 --> 00:27:07
It is a dummy variable.
It doesn't matter what you call

408
00:27:05 --> 00:27:11
it.
It is still the Laplace

409
00:27:07 --> 00:27:13
transform if I make that wiggly
t or t star or tau or u.

410
00:27:12 --> 00:27:18
I can call it anything I want
and it is still the Laplace

411
00:27:16 --> 00:27:22
transform of f of t.

412
00:27:20 --> 00:27:26

413
00:27:24 --> 00:27:30
What is the answer?
That is e to the negative as

414
00:27:27 --> 00:27:33
times the Laplace transform of
the function f.

415
00:27:33 --> 00:27:39
That is what I promised you in
that formula.

416
00:27:35 --> 00:27:41
Now, how about the other
formula?

417
00:27:37 --> 00:27:43
Well, let's look at that
quickly.

418
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
That is, as I say,
just sleight of hand.

419
00:27:42 --> 00:27:48
But since that is the formula
you will be using at least half

420
00:27:46 --> 00:27:52
the time you better learn it.
This little sleight of hand is

421
00:27:50 --> 00:27:56
also reproduced in one page of
notes that I give you,

422
00:27:53 --> 00:27:59
but maybe you will find it easy
to understand if I talk it out

423
00:27:57 --> 00:28:03
loud.
The problem now is for the

424
00:28:00 --> 00:28:06
second formula.
I am going to have to recopy

425
00:28:03 --> 00:28:09
out the first one in order to
make the argument in a form in

426
00:28:07 --> 00:28:13
which you will understand it,
I hope.

427
00:28:09 --> 00:28:15
This goes to e to the minus as
F s,

428
00:28:13 --> 00:28:19
except I am now going to write
that not in F of s;

429
00:28:16 --> 00:28:22
since I will not be able to
write the second formula using F

430
00:28:20 --> 00:28:26
of s, I am not going to write
the first formula that way

431
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
either.
I will write it as the Laplace

432
00:28:26 --> 00:28:32
transform with f of t.

433
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
Now, formally if somebody says,
okay, how do I calculate the

434
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
Laplace transform of this thing?
I say put down this.

435
00:28:39 --> 00:28:45
Well, that has no t in it.
It doesn't have the f in it

436
00:28:43 --> 00:28:49
either.
Then write this.

437
00:28:45 --> 00:28:51
What formula did I do?
I looked at that and changed t

438
00:28:50 --> 00:28:56
minus a to t. Now, 
how did I change t minus a?

439
00:28:55 --> 00:29:01
The way to say it is 

440
00:28:58 --> 00:29:04
I changed t.
Because the t is always there.

441
00:29:02 --> 00:29:08
t to t plus a.
You get this by replace t by t

442
00:29:08 --> 00:29:14
plus a to get the right-hand
side.

443
00:29:12 --> 00:29:18

444
00:29:16 --> 00:29:22
I replace this t by t plus a,
and that turns this 

445
00:29:20 --> 00:29:26
into f of t.
And that is the f of t

446
00:29:22 --> 00:29:28
that went in there.
That is the universal rule for

447
00:29:26 --> 00:29:32
doing it.
Now I am going to use that same

448
00:29:28 --> 00:29:34
rule for transforming u of t
minus a times f of t.

449
00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
See, the problem is now I have

450
00:29:36 --> 00:29:42
a function like t squared
or sine t,

451
00:29:39 --> 00:29:45
which is not written in terms
of t minus a.

452
00:29:42 --> 00:29:48
And I don't know what to do
with it.

453
00:29:44 --> 00:29:50
The answer is,
by brute force,

454
00:29:46 --> 00:29:52
write it in terms of t minus a.

455
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
What is brute force?
Brute force is the following.

456
00:29:52 --> 00:29:58
I am going to put a t minus a
there if it kills me.

457
00:29:56 --> 00:30:02
t minus a plus a.
No harm in that,

458
00:30:01 --> 00:30:07
is there?
Now there is a t minus a there,

459
00:30:04 --> 00:30:10
just the way there was up
there.

460
00:30:06 --> 00:30:12
And now what is the rule?
I am just going to follow my

461
00:30:11 --> 00:30:17
nose.
What's sauce for the goose is

462
00:30:13 --> 00:30:19
sauce for the gander.
Minus as, Laplace transform of

463
00:30:17 --> 00:30:23
f of, now what am I going to
write here?

464
00:30:20 --> 00:30:26
Wherever I see a t,
I am going to change it from t

465
00:30:24 --> 00:30:30
plus a.
Here I see a t.

466
00:30:29 --> 00:30:35
I will change that 
to t plus a.

467
00:30:33 --> 00:30:39
What do I have?
t plus a minus a plus a,

468
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
well,
if you can keep count,

469
00:30:41 --> 00:30:47
what does that make?
It makes t plus a in

470
00:30:46 --> 00:30:52
the end.

471
00:30:48 --> 00:30:54

472
00:31:02 --> 00:31:08
The peace that passeth
understanding.

473
00:31:04 --> 00:31:10
Let's do some examples and
suddenly you will breathe a sigh

474
00:31:08 --> 00:31:14
of relief that this all is
doable anyway.

475
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
Let's calculate something.
I hope I am not covering up any

476
00:31:16 --> 00:31:22
crucial, yes I am.
I am covering up the u of t's,

477
00:31:19 --> 00:31:25
but you know that by now.
Let's see.

478
00:31:22 --> 00:31:28
What should we calculate first?
What I just covered up.

479
00:31:27 --> 00:31:33
Let's calculate the Laplace
transform of (u)ab of t.

480
00:31:31 --> 00:31:37
What is that going to be?

481
00:31:34 --> 00:31:40
Well, first of all,
write out what it is in terms

482
00:31:38 --> 00:31:44
of the unit step function.

483
00:31:41 --> 00:31:47

484
00:31:45 --> 00:31:51
Remember that formula?
There.

485
00:31:47 --> 00:31:53
Now you see it.
Now you don't.

486
00:31:50 --> 00:31:56
Its Laplace transform is going
to be what?

487
00:31:54 --> 00:32:00
Well, the Laplace transform of
t minus a,

488
00:31:59 --> 00:32:05
that is a special case here
where this function is one.

489
00:32:05 --> 00:32:11
Well, that one.
Either one.

490
00:32:07 --> 00:32:13
It makes no difference.
It is simply going to be the

491
00:32:11 --> 00:32:17
Laplace transform of what f of t
would have been,

492
00:32:15 --> 00:32:21
which is --

493
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23

494
00:32:26 --> 00:32:32
See, the Laplace transform of u
of t is what?

495
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
That's one over s,
right?

496
00:32:31 --> 00:32:37
Because this is the function
one, and we don't care the fact

497
00:32:36 --> 00:32:42
that it is zero or negative
values of t.

498
00:32:39 --> 00:32:45
That is my f of s.
And so I multiply it by e to

499
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
the minus as times one over s.

500
00:32:46 --> 00:32:52
I am using this formula,
e to the minus as times the

501
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
Laplace transform of the unit
step function,

502
00:32:53 --> 00:32:59
which is one over s.
How about the translation?

503
00:32:59 --> 00:33:05
That was taken care of by the
exponential factor.

504
00:33:03 --> 00:33:09
And it's minus because this is
minus.

505
00:33:06 --> 00:33:12
The same thing with the b.
This is the Laplace transform

506
00:33:10 --> 00:33:16
of the unit box function.
It looks a little hairy.

507
00:33:14 --> 00:33:20
You will learn to work with it,
don't worry about it.

508
00:33:19 --> 00:33:25
How about the Laplace transform
of --

509
00:33:23 --> 00:33:29
Okay.
Let's use the other formula.

510
00:33:25 --> 00:33:31
What would be the Laplace
transform of u of t minus one

511
00:33:29 --> 00:33:35
times t squared, for example?

512
00:33:33 --> 00:33:39
See, if I gave this to you and
you only had the first formula,

513
00:33:38 --> 00:33:44
you would say,
hey, but there is no t minus

514
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
one in there.
There is only t squared.

515
00:33:44 --> 00:33:50
What am I supposed to do?

516
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
Well, some of you might dig way
back into high school and say

517
00:33:51 --> 00:33:57
every polynomial can be written
in powers of t minus one,

518
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
that is what I will do.
That would give the right

519
00:34:02 --> 00:34:08
answer.
But in case you had forgotten

520
00:34:05 --> 00:34:11
how to do that,
you don't have to know because

521
00:34:08 --> 00:34:14
you could use the other formula
instead, which,

522
00:34:12 --> 00:34:18
by the way, is the way you do
it.

523
00:34:15 --> 00:34:21
What are we going to do?
It goes into e to the minus s.

524
00:34:19 --> 00:34:25
The a is one in this case,

525
00:34:22 --> 00:34:28
plus one.
e to the minus s times the

526
00:34:25 --> 00:34:31
Laplace transform of what
function?

527
00:34:30 --> 00:34:36
Change t to t plus one.

528
00:34:33 --> 00:34:39
The Laplace transform of t plus
one squared.

529
00:34:38 --> 00:34:44
What is that?
That is e to the minus s times

530
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
the Laplace transform of t
squared plus 2t plus one.

531
00:34:46 --> 00:34:52
What's that?

532
00:34:49 --> 00:34:55
Well, by the formulas which I
am not bothering to write on the

533
00:34:54 --> 00:35:00
board anymore because you know
them, it is e to the minus s

534
00:34:59 --> 00:35:05
times --
Laplace transform of t squared

535
00:35:04 --> 00:35:10
is two factorial over s cubed.

536
00:35:07 --> 00:35:13
Remember you always have to

537
00:35:09 --> 00:35:15
raise the exponent by one.
This is two factorial,

538
00:35:12 --> 00:35:18
but that is the same as two.
Plus two.

539
00:35:15 --> 00:35:21
This two comes from there.
The Laplace transform of t is

540
00:35:19 --> 00:35:25
one over s squared.

541
00:35:21 --> 00:35:27
And, finally,
the Laplace transform of one is

542
00:35:24 --> 00:35:30
one over s.
You mean all that mess from

543
00:35:30 --> 00:35:36
this simple-looking function?
This function is not so simple.

544
00:35:34 --> 00:35:40
What is its graph?
What is it we are calculating

545
00:35:38 --> 00:35:44
the Laplace transform of?
Well, it is the function t

546
00:35:42 --> 00:35:48
squared.
But multiplying it by that

547
00:35:45 --> 00:35:51
factor u of t minus one 
means that the only part of

548
00:35:50 --> 00:35:56
it I am using is this part,
because u of t minus one is one

549
00:35:55 --> 00:36:01
when t is
bigger than one.

550
00:36:00 --> 00:36:06
But when t is less than one it
is zero.

551
00:36:02 --> 00:36:08
That function doesn't look all
that simple to me.

552
00:36:05 --> 00:36:11
And that is why its Laplace
transform has three terms in it

553
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
with this exponential factor.
Well, it is a discontinuous

554
00:36:13 --> 00:36:19
function.
And it gets discontinuous at a

555
00:36:16 --> 00:36:22
very peculiar spot.
You have to expect that.

556
00:36:19 --> 00:36:25
Where in this does it tell you
it becomes discontinuous at one?

557
00:36:23 --> 00:36:29
It is because this is e to the
minus one times s.

558
00:36:29 --> 00:36:35
This tells you where the
discontinuity occurs.

559
00:36:32 --> 00:36:38
The rest of it is just stuff
you have to take because it is

560
00:36:37 --> 00:36:43
the function t squared.
It's what it is.

561
00:36:41 --> 00:36:47
All right.
I think most of you are going

562
00:36:44 --> 00:36:50
to encounter the worst troubles
when you try to calculate

563
00:36:49 --> 00:36:55
inverse Laplace transforms,
so let me try to explain how

564
00:36:53 --> 00:36:59
that is done.
I will give you a simple

565
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
example first.
And then I will try to give you

566
00:37:01 --> 00:37:07
a slightly more complicated one.
But even the simple one won't

567
00:37:06 --> 00:37:12
make your head ache.
We are going to calculate the

568
00:37:11 --> 00:37:17
inverse Laplace transform of
this guy, one plus e to the

569
00:37:16 --> 00:37:22
negative pi s --

570
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24

571
00:37:24 --> 00:37:30
-- divided by s squared plus
one.

572
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36

573
00:37:35 --> 00:37:41
All right.
Now, the first thing you must

574
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
do is as soon as you see
exponential factors in there

575
00:37:40 --> 00:37:46
like that you know that these
functions, the answer is going

576
00:37:44 --> 00:37:50
to be a discontinuous function.
And you have got to separate

577
00:37:48 --> 00:37:54
out the different pieces of it
that go with the different

578
00:37:52 --> 00:37:58
exponentials.
Because the way the formula

579
00:37:54 --> 00:38:00
works, it has to be used
differently for each value of a.

580
00:37:59 --> 00:38:05
Now, in this case,
there is only one value of a

581
00:38:02 --> 00:38:08
that occurs.
Negative pi.

582
00:38:03 --> 00:38:09
But it does mean that we are
going to have to begin by

583
00:38:07 --> 00:38:13
separating out the thing into
one over s squared plus one

584
00:38:11 --> 00:38:17
and this other
factor e to the negative pi s

585
00:38:15 --> 00:38:21
divided by s squared plus one.

586
00:38:19 --> 00:38:25
Now all I have to do is take
the inverse Laplace transform of

587
00:38:23 --> 00:38:29
each piece.
The inverse Laplace transform

588
00:38:26 --> 00:38:32
of one over s squared plus one
is --

589
00:38:32 --> 00:38:38
Well, up to now we have been
saying its sine t,

590
00:38:36 --> 00:38:42
right?
If you say it is sine t you are

591
00:38:38 --> 00:38:44
going to get into trouble.
How come?

592
00:38:41 --> 00:38:47
We didn't get into trouble
before.

593
00:38:43 --> 00:38:49
Yes, but that was because there
were no exponentials in the

594
00:38:47 --> 00:38:53
expression.
When there are exponentials you

595
00:38:50 --> 00:38:56
have to be more careful.
Make the inverse transform

596
00:38:54 --> 00:39:00
unique.
Make it not sine t,

597
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
but u of t sine t.

598
00:39:00 --> 00:39:06
You will see why in just a
moment.

599
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
If this weren't there then sine
t would be perfectly okay.

600
00:39:07 --> 00:39:13
With that factor there,
you have got to put in the u of

601
00:39:11 --> 00:39:17
t, otherwise you won't
be able to get the formula to

602
00:39:16 --> 00:39:22
work right.
In other words,

603
00:39:18 --> 00:39:24
I must use this particular one
that I picked out to make it

604
00:39:23 --> 00:39:29
unique at the beginning of the
period.

605
00:39:26 --> 00:39:32
Otherwise, it just won't work.
Now, I know that is fine.

606
00:39:31 --> 00:39:37
But now what is the inverse
Laplace transform of e to the

607
00:39:35 --> 00:39:41
minus pi?
In other words,

608
00:39:38 --> 00:39:44
it is the same function,
except I am now multiplying it

609
00:39:41 --> 00:39:47
by e to the negative pi s.

610
00:39:44 --> 00:39:50
Well, now I will use that
formula.

611
00:39:46 --> 00:39:52
My f of s is one over s squared
plus one,

612
00:39:50 --> 00:39:56
and that corresponds it to
sine t.

613
00:39:54 --> 00:40:00
If I multiply it by e to the
minus pi s,

614
00:39:57 --> 00:40:03
just copy it down.
It now corresponds,

615
00:40:02 --> 00:40:08
the inverse Laplace transform,
to what the left side says it

616
00:40:08 --> 00:40:14
does.
u of t minus pi

617
00:40:12 --> 00:40:18
times, in other words,
this corresponds to that.

618
00:40:17 --> 00:40:23
Then if I multiply it by e to
the minus pi s,

619
00:40:23 --> 00:40:29
it corresponds to change the t
to t minus pi.

620
00:40:31 --> 00:40:37

621
00:40:38 --> 00:40:44
What is the answer?
The answer is you sum these two

622
00:40:43 --> 00:40:49
pieces.
The first piece is u of time

623
00:40:47 --> 00:40:53
sine t.
The second piece is u of t

624
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59
minus pi sine t of minus pi.

625
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
Now, if you leave the answer in
that form it is technically

626
00:41:05 --> 00:41:11
correct, but you are going to
lose a lot of credit.

627
00:41:09 --> 00:41:15
You have to transform it to
make it look good.

628
00:41:13 --> 00:41:19
You have to make it
intelligible.

629
00:41:16 --> 00:41:22
You are not allowed to leave it
in that form.

630
00:41:20 --> 00:41:26
What could we do to it?
Well, you see,

631
00:41:24 --> 00:41:30
this part of it is interesting
whenever t is positive.

632
00:41:30 --> 00:41:36
This part of it is only
interesting when t is greater

633
00:41:34 --> 00:41:40
than or equal to pi because
this is zero.

634
00:41:37 --> 00:41:43
Before that this is zero.
What you have to do is make

635
00:41:41 --> 00:41:47
cases.
Let's call the answer f of t.

636
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
The function has to be

637
00:41:47 --> 00:41:53
presented in what is called the
cases format.

638
00:41:50 --> 00:41:56
That is what it is called when
you type in tech,

639
00:41:54 --> 00:42:00
which I think a certain number
of you can do anyway.

640
00:42:00 --> 00:42:06
You have to make cases.
The first case is what happened

641
00:42:04 --> 00:42:10
between zero and pi?
Well, between zero and pi,

642
00:42:08 --> 00:42:14
only this term is operational.
The other one is zero because

643
00:42:12 --> 00:42:18
of that factor.
Therefore, between zero and pi

644
00:42:16 --> 00:42:22
the function looks like,
now, I don't have to put in the

645
00:42:21 --> 00:42:27
u of t because that is
equal to one.

646
00:42:24 --> 00:42:30
It is equal to sine t
between zero and pi.

647
00:42:30 --> 00:42:36
What is it equal to bigger than
pi?

648
00:42:32 --> 00:42:38
Well, the first factor,
the first term still obtains,

649
00:42:36 --> 00:42:42
so I have to include that.
But now I have to add the

650
00:42:40 --> 00:42:46
second one.
Well, what is the second term?

651
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
I don't include the t minus
pi, u of t minus pi

652
00:42:48 --> 00:42:54
anymore because
that is now one.

653
00:42:51 --> 00:42:57
That has the value one.
It is sine of t minus pi.

654
00:42:55 --> 00:43:01
But what is sine of t minus pi?

655
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
You take the sine curve and you
translate it to the right by pi.

656
00:43:07 --> 00:43:13
So what happens to it?
It turns into this curve.

657
00:43:13 --> 00:43:19
In other words,
it turns into the curve,

658
00:43:18 --> 00:43:24
what curve is that?
Minus sine t.

659
00:43:23 --> 00:43:29

660
00:43:30 --> 00:43:36
The other factor,
this factor is one and this

661
00:43:33 --> 00:43:39
becomes negative sine t.

662
00:43:37 --> 00:43:43

663
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
And so the final answer is f of
t is equal to sine t

664
00:43:50 --> 00:43:56
between zero and pi and
zero for t greater than or equal

665
00:43:58 --> 00:44:04
to pi.
That is the right form of the

666
00:44:03 --> 00:44:09
answer.
