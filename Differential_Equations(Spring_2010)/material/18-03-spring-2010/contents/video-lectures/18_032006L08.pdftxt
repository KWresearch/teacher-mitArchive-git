18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 8 

I usually like to start a lecture with something new, but this time I'm going to make 
an exception, and start w ith the finishing up on Friday because it involves a little 
more practice with complex numbers. I think that's what a large number of you are 
still fairly weak in. So, to briefly remind you, it will be sort of self-conta ined, but still, 
it will use complex numbers. And, I think it's a good way to start today. 

So, remember, the basic problem was to solve something with, where the input was 
sinusoida l in particular. The k was on both sides, and the input looked like 
cos(omega t). And, the plan of the solution consisted of transporting the problem to 
the complex domain. So, you look for a complex solution, and you comp lexify the 
right hand side of the equation, as well. So, cos(omega t) becomes the real part of 
this complex function. The reason  for doing that, remember, was because  it's easier 
to handle when you solve linear equations. It's much easier to handle exponentials 
on the right-hand side than  it is to hand le sines and cosines because exponentials 
are so easy to  integrate when you multip ly them by other exponentia ls. So, the 
result was, after doing that, y tilda turned out to be one, after I sca le the coefficient, 
y~ = 1 / (1 + omega/k). 

And then, the rest was e^( i (omega t - phi), where phi had a certain meaning. It was 
the arc tangent of a, it was a phase lag. And, this was then, I had to  take the real 
part of this to get the final answer, which came out to be something like 1 / sqrt(1 + 
(omega/k)^2) * cos (omega t - phi). It's easier to see that that part is the real part 
of this; the prob lem is, of course you have to convert this. 

Sorry, this should be i omega t, in which case you don't need the parentheses, 
either. So, the prob lem was to use the polar representation of this complex number 
to convert it into something whose amplitude was this, and whose ang le was minus 
phi. Now, that's what we ca ll the polar method, going polar. I'd like, now,  for the 
first few minutes of the period, to talk about the other method,  the Cartesian 
method. I think for a long while, many of you will be more comfortable with that 
anyway. Although, one of the ob jects of the course should be to get you equa lly 
comfortable with the polar representation of complex numbers. So, if we try to do 
the same thing going Cartesian, what's going to happen? Well, I guess the same 
point here. 

So, the starting point is still y~ = 1 / (1 +  i(omega/k)) * e^(i omega t). But now, 
what you're going to do  is turn this into its Cartesian,  turn both of these into their 
Cartesian representations as a + b i. So,  if you do that Cartesianly, of course, what 
you have to do is the standard thing about d ividing comp lex numbers or taking the 
reciproca ls that I told you at the very beginning of complex numbers. You multiply 
the top and bottom by the complex conjugate of this in order to make the bottom 
real. So, what does this become? This becomes (1 - i(omega/k)) / (1 + 
(omega/k)^2). 

So, I've now converted this to  the a + bi form. I have a lso to convert the right-hand 
side to the a plus bi form. So, it w ill  look like cos(omega t) + i sin(omega t). Having 
done that, I take the last step, which is to take the rea l part of that. Remember, the 
reason I want the rea l part  is because this input was the real part of the comp lex 
input. 

So, once you've got the complex solution, you have to take its real part to go back 
into  the doma in you started w ith, of real numbers, from the doma in of complex 
numbers. So, I want the rea l part is going to be, the real part of that is, first of all, 
there's a factor out in  front. That's entirely rea l. Let's put that out in front, so doesn't 
bother us particularly. And now, I need the product of this complex number and that 
complex number. But, I only want the real part of it. So, I'm not going to multiply it 
out and get four terms. I'm just going to look at the two terms that I do want. I 
don't want the others. All right, the rea l part is cos(omega t), from the product of 
this and that. 

And, the rest of the real part will be the product of the two i terms. But, it's i times 
negative  i, which makes one. And therefore, it's (omega / k) * sin(omega t). Now, 
that's the answer. And that's the answer, too; they must be equal, unless there's a 
contradiction in mathematics. But,  it's extremely important. And that's the other 
reason why I'm g iving you this, that you learn in this course to be able to convert 
quickly and automatically things that look like this into things that look like that. 
And, that's done by means of a basic formula, which occurs at the end of the notes 
for reference, as I optimistically say, although I think for a lot of you w ill not be 
referenced, stuff in the category of, yeah, I think I've vaguely seen that somewhere. 

But, well, we never used it for anything. Okay, you're going to use it a ll term. So, 
the formula is, the famous trigonometric  identity, which is, so, the problem is to 
convert this into the other guy. And, the thing which is going to do that, enab le one 
to combine the sine and the cosine terms, is the famous formula that a times the 
cosine, I'm going to use theta to make it as neutra l as possible, --

-- so, theta you can think of as being rep laced by omega t in this particular 
application of the formula. But, I'll just use a general ang le theta, which doesn't 
suggest anything in particular. So, the problem  is, you have something which is a 
combination with real coefficients of cosine and sine, and the important thing is that 
these numbers be the same. In practice, that means that the omega t, you're not 
allowed to have omega1 t here, and some other frequency, omega2 t here. That 
would correspond to using theta one here, and theta two here. And, though there  is 
a formula for comb ining that, nobody remembers it, and it's, in general, less 
universa lly useful than the first. 

If you're going to memorize a  formula, and learn this one, it's best to start w ith the 
ones where the two are equa l. That's the basic formula. The others are variations of 
it, but there is a sizab le variations. All right, so the answer is that this is equa l to 
some other constant, real constant,  times the cos(theta - phi). Of course, most 
people remember this vaguely. What they don't remember is what the c and the phi 
are, how to calculate them. I don't suggest you memorize the formulas for them. 
You can if you w ish. Instead, memorize the p icture, which is much easier. Memorize 
that a and b are the two sides of a right triang le. Phi is the angle opposite the b side, 
and c is the length of the hypotenuse. 

Okay, that's worth putting up. I think that's a p ink formula. It's even worth two of 
those, but I will thrift. Now, let's app ly it to this case to see that  it gives the right 
answer. So,  to use this formula, how I use it? Well, I should take, I w ill reproduce 
the left-hand side. So that part, I just copy. And, how about the right? Well,  the 
amplitude, it's combined into a single cosine term whose amplitude is, well, the two 
sides of the right triangle are one, and omega/k. 

The hypotenuse in that case  is going to be, well, why don't we write it here? So, we 
have one, and omega/k. And, here's phi. So, the hypotenuse is going to be the 
sqrt(1 + (omega/k)^2). And, that's going to be multip lied by the cos(omega t - phi). 
You can write, if you wish, phi equals the arc tangent, but you are not learning a lot 
by that. phi = arctan(omega / k). That's okay, but it's true. But, notice there's 
cancellation now. This over that is equal to what? Well, it's equal to this. 

And, so when we get in this way, by comb ining these two factors, one gets exactly 
the same formula that we got before. So, as you can see, in some sense, there's not, 
if you can remember this trigonometric identity, there's not a lot of difference 
between the two methods except that this one requires this extra step. The answer 
will come out in this form, and you then, to see what it really looks like, really have 
to convert it to this form, the form in which you can see what the phase lag and the 
amplitude is. 

It's amazing how many people who should know, this includes working 
mathematicians, theoretical mathematicians, includes even possib ly the authors of 
your textbooks. I'm not sure, but I've caught them in this,  too, who in this form, 
everybody remembers that it's something like that. Unfortunately, when it occurs as 
the answer in an answer book, the numbers are some colossa l mess here plus some 
colossa l mess here. 

And theta  is, again, a real mess, involving  roots and some cube roots, and whatnot. 
The only thing is, these two are the same real mess. That amounts to just another 
pure oscillation with the same frequency as the old guy, and w ith the amplitude 
changed, and with a phase shift, move to the right or left. So, this is no more 
general than that. Notice they both have two parameters in them, these two 
coefficients. This one has the two parameters in an altered  form. Okay, well, I 
wanted, because of the importance of this formula, I wanted to take a couple of 
minutes out for a proof of the formula, --

-- just to g ive you chance to stare at it a little more now. There are three proofs I 
know. I'm sure there are 27. The Pythagorean theorem now has severa l hundred. 
But,  there are three basic proofs. There  is the one I w ill not give you, I'll ca ll the high 
school proof, which is the only one one norma lly finds in books, physics textbooks or 
other textbooks. The high school proof takes the right-hand side, applies the formula 
for the cosine of the d ifference of two ang les, which it assumes you had in 
trigonometry, and then converts it into  this. It shows you that once you've done 
that, that a turns out to be c cos(phi) and b, the number b is c sin(phi), and 
therefore it identifies the two sides. 

Now, the thing that's of course correct and it's the simp lest possible argument, the 
thing that's no good about it is that the d irection at which it goes is from here to 
here. Well, everybody knew that. If I gave you this and told you, write it out in terms 
of cosine and sine, I would assume it dearly hope that practica lly all of you can do 
that. Unfortunately, when you want to use the formula, it's this way you want to use 

it in the opposite direction. You are starting with this, and want to convert it to that. 
Now, the proof, therefore, will not be of much help. It requires you to go  in the 
backwards direction, and match up coefficients. It's much better to go forwards. 
Now, there are two proofs that go  forwards. There's the 18.02 proof. Since I d idn't 
teach most of you 18.02, I can't be sure you had it. 

So, I'll spend one minute giving it to you. What is the 18.02 proof? It is the follow ing 
picture. I think this requires deep colored cha lk. This is going to be pretty heavy. All 
right, first of all, the a and the b are the given. So, I'm going  to put in that vector. 
So, there is the vector whose sides are, whose components are a and b. I'll write it 
without the i and j. I hope you had from Jerison that form for the vector, if you don't 
like that, write a i + bj, okay? Now, there's another vector lurking around. It's the 
unit vector whose, I'll write it this way, u because it's a unit vector, and theta to 
indicate that it's ang le is theta. 

Now, the reason for doing that is because you see that the left-hand side is a dot 
product of two vectors. The left-hand side of the identity is the dot product of the 
vector w ith the vector whose components are cosine theta and sine theta. That's 
what I'm ca lling this unit vector. It's a unit vector because (cos^2(theta) + 
sin^2(theta) = 1. 

Now, a ll this formula  is, is saying that scalar product, the dot product of those two 
vectors, can be evaluated if you know their components by the left-hand side of the 
formula. And, if you don't know their components, it can be evaluated in another 
way, the geometric evaluation, which goes, what is it? It's a magnitude of one, times 
the magnitude of the other, times the cosine of the included ang le. 

Now, what's the included angle? Well, theta is this angle from the horizonta l to that 
unit vector. The angle phi is this angle, from this p icture here. And therefore, the 
included angle between (u)theta and my pink vector is theta - phi. That's the 
formula. It comes from two ways of calculating the sca lar product of the vector 
whose coefficients are , and the unit vector whose components are cosine theta and 
sine theta . All right, well, you should, that was 18.02. 

There must be an 18.03 proof also. Yes. What's the 18.03 proof? The 18.03 proof 
uses complex numbers. It says, look, take the left side. Instead of view ing it as the 
dot product of two vectors, there's another way. You can think of it as the part of the 
products of two comp lex numbers. So, the 18.03 argument, really,  the complex 
number argument says, look, multiply together a - b i and the complex number 
cos(theta) + i sin(theta). There are different ways of expla ining why I want to put 
the minus i there instead of  i. But, the simp lest is because I want, when I take the 
real part, to get the  left-hand side. 

I w ill. If I take the real part of this, I'm going to get a cos(theta) + b sin(theta) 
because of -i * i = 1, multiplied together. All right, that's the left-hand side. And 
now, the right-hand side, I'm going to use polar representation instead. What's the 
polar representation of this guy? Well, if has the angle theta, then a - b, a - bi goes 
down below. It has the angle minus phi. So, this is, has magnitude. It is polar 
representation. Its magnitude is a^2 + b^2, and its ang le is negative phi, not 
positive phi because this a - bi goes below the axis if a and b are positive. 

So, it's e^(-i phi). That's the first guy. And, how about the second guy? Well, the 
second guy  is e^(i theta). So, what's the product? It is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) e^(i (theta 

- phi)). And now, what do I want? The real part of this, and I want the real part of 
this. 

So, let's just say take the real parts of both sides. If I take the real part of the left-
hand side, I get a cos(theta) + b sin(theta). If I take a real part of this side, I get 
sqrt(a^2 + b^2) cos(theta - phi), which is just what it's supposed to be. 

Well, with three d ifferent arguments, I'm rea lly pounding the table on this formula. 
But, I think there's something to be learned  from at least two of them. And, you 
know, I'm still, for awhile, I will never miss an opportunity to bang complex numbers 
into your head because, in some sense, you have to reproduce the experience of the 
race. As I mentioned in the notes, it took mathematicians 300 or 400 years to get 
used to comp lex numbers. So, if it takes you three or four weeks, that's not too bad. 

Now, for the rest of the period  I'd like to go back to the linear equations, and try to 
put into perspective and summarize, and tell you a couple of things which I had to 
leave out, but which are, in my view, extremely important. And, up to now, I don't 
want to leave you w ith any misapprehensions. So, I'm going to summarize this way, 
whereas last lecture I went from the most general equation to the most specia l. 

I'd like to just write them down in the reverse order, now. So, we are talking about 
basic linear equations. First order, of course, we haven't moved as a second order 
yet. So, the most special one, and the one we ta lked about essentia lly all of the 
previous two times, or last Friday, anyway, was the equation where the k, the 
coefficient of y, is constant, and where you a lso get it on the right-hand side quite 
providentia lly. 

So, this  is the most specia l form, and it's the one which governed what I w ill call the 
temperature-concentration model, or if you want to be grown up, the conduction-
diffusion model, conduction-diffusion which describes the processes, which the 
equation is modeling, whereas these simp ly described the variab les of things, which 
you usua lly are trying to ca lculate when you use the equation. Now, there are a class 
of things where the thing is constant, but where the k does not appear natura lly on 
the right hand side. And, you're going to encounter them pretty quickly in physics, 
for one p lace. So, I better not try to sweep those under the rug. 

Let's just ca ll that q of t. And finally, there is the most general case, where you allow 
k to be non-constant. That's the one we began, when we ta lked about the linear 
equation. And you know how to solve it in general by a definite or an indefinite 
integral. Now, there's one other thing, which I want to ta lk about. I w ill do all these 
in a certain order. But, from the beginning, you should keep in mind that there's 
another between the first two cases. Between the first two cases, there's another 
extremely important d istinction, and that is as to whether k is positive or not. Up to 
now, we've always had k>0. So, I'm going to put that here. So, it's understood when 
I write these, that k is positive. 

I want to talk about that, too. But,  first things first. The first thing  I wanted to do 
was to show you that this, the first case, the most specia l case, does not just apply 
to this. It applies to other things, too. Let me g ive you a mixing problem. The typical 
mixing problem g ives another examp le. You've already done in recitation, and you 
did one for the problem set, the problem of the two rooms filled w ith smoke. 

But,  let me do it just using letters, so that the ideas stand out a little more clearly, 
and you are not preoccupied w ith the numbers, and calculating with the numbers, 
and trying to get numerica l examples. So, it's as simp le as k sub mixing. It looks like 
this. You have a tank, a  room, I don't know, where everything's getting mixed in. It 
has a certa in volume, which I w ill call v. Something is flowing in, a gas or a liquid. 
And, r w ill be the flow  rate, in some units. Now, since it can't pile up inside this 
sealed conta iner, which I'm sure is full, the flow  rate out must also be r. And, what 
we're interested in is the amount of salt. So, x, let's suppose these are fluid flows, 
and the d issolved substance that I'm talking about is not carbon monoxide, it's salt, 
any dissolved substance, some pollutant or whatever the prob lem ca lls for. 

Let's use sa lt. So, it's the amount of salt in the tank at time t. I'm interested in 
know ing how that varies w ith time. Now, there's nothing to be said about how  it 
flows out. What flows out, of course, is what happens to be in the tank. But, I do 
have to say what flows in. Now, the only convenient way to describe the in-flow is  in 
terms of its concentration. The salt w ill be dissolved  in the in-flowing water, and so 
there will be a certain concentration. And, as you w ill see, for a secret reason, I'm 
going to give that the subscript e. 

So, e is the concentration of the incoming salt, in other words, in the fluid, how 
many grams are there per liter in the incoming  fluid. That's the data. So, this is the 
data. r is part of the data. r is the flow  rate. v is the volume. I think I won't bother 
writing that down, and the problem  is to determine what happens to x of t. Now, I 
strongly recommend you not attempt to work d irectly with the concentrations unless 
you  feel you have a really good physica l feeling for concentrations. I strongly 
recommend you work with a variab le that you are g iven, namely, the dependent 
variable, which is the amount of sa lt, grams. Well, because it's something you can 
physically think about. It's coming in, it's getting mixed up, and some of it is going 
out. 

So, the basic equation is going to be that the rate of change of sa lt in the tank is the 
rate of salt inflow, let me write salt inflow, minus the rate of salt outflow. Okay, at 
what rate is salt flowing  in? Well, the flow rate is the flow rate of the liquid. I multiply 
the flow rate, 1 L per minute times the concentration, 3 g per liter. That means 3 g 
per minute. It's going to be, therefore, the product of the flow  rate and the 
concentration, incoming concentration. 

How about the rate of the sa lt outflow? Well, again, the rate of the liquid outflow is r. 
And, what  is the concentration of salt in the outflow? I must use, when you ta lk flow 
rates, the other factor must be the concentration, not the amount. So, what is the 
concentration in the outflow? Well, it's the amount of salt in the tank divided by  its 
volume. So, the ana log, the concentration here is x divided by v. Now, here's a 
typica l messy equation, dx / dt, let's write  it in the standard, linear form, p lus r times 
x over v equals r times the given concentration, which is a  function of time. Now, 
this is going to be some given function, and there will be no reason whatsoever why 
you can't solve it in that form. 

And, that's norma lly what you will do. Nonetheless, in trying to understand how it 
fits into this parad igm, which kind of equation is it? Well, clearly there's an 
awkwardness in that on the right-hand side, we have concentration, and on the left-
hand side, we seem  to have amounts. Now, the way to understand the equation as 
opposed to the way to solve it, well, it's a step on the way to solving it. But, I 
emphasize, you can and normally w ill solve it in exactly that form. 

But,  to understand what's happening, it's better to express it in terms of 
concentration entirely, and  that's why it's called  the concentration, or the diffusion, 
concentration-diffusion equation. So, I'm going to convert this to concentrations. 
Now, there's no prob lem here. x over v  is the concentration in the tank. And now, 
immed iately, you see, hey, it looks like it's going to come out just  in the first form. 

But, wa it a minute. How about the x? How do I convert that? Well, what's the 
relation between x? So, if the concentration in the tank is equal to x over v, so the 
tank concentration, then x is equal to C times the constant, V, and dx / dt, therefore, 
will be c times dC / dt. You see that? Now, that's not in standard form. Let's put it in 
standard  form. To put it in standard form, I see, now, that it's not r that's the critical 
quantity. It's r d ivided by v. 

So, it's dC/dt + (r/v)C = (r/v)Ce. That's the equation expressed in a  form where the 
concentration is the dependent variable, rather than the amount of salt itself. And, 
you can see it falls exactly in this category. That means that I can talk about it. The 
natural way to ta lk about this equation is in terms of, the same way we talked about 
the temperature equation. 

I said concentration. I mean, that concentration has nothing to do with this 
concentration. This is the diffusion model, where sa lt solution outside, cell in the 
middle, salt d iffusing through a semi-permeab le membrane  into that, uses Newton's 
law of diffusion, except he d idn't do a law of diffusion. But, he is sticky. H is name is 
attached to everything. So, that's this concentration model. It's the one entirely 
analogous to the temperature. And the physical setup is the same. This one is 
entirely d ifferent. M ixing in this form of this problem has really nothing to do with 
this model whatsoever. But, nor does that concentration had anything to do w ith this 
concentration, which refers to the result of the mixing in the tank. 

But, what happens is the differential equation is the same. The language of input and 
response that we talked about  is also available here. So, everything is the same. 
And, the most interesting thing is that it shows that the ana log of the conductivity, 
the k, the ana log of conductivity and d iffusivity is this quantity. I should not be 
considering r and v by themselves. I should be considering as the basic quantity, the 
ratio of those two. Now, why  is that, is the basic parameter. What is this? Well, r is 
the rate of outflow, and the rate of inflow, what's r over v? r over v is the fractional 
rate of outflow. In other words, if r over v is one tenth, it means that 1/10 of the 
tank w ill be emptied in a minute, say. 

In other words, we lumped these two constants  into a sing le k, and at the same time 
have simp lified the units. What are the units? This  is volume per minute. This is 
volume. So, it's simp ly reciprocal minutes, reciprocal time, which was the same units 
of that d iffusivity and conductivity had, reciprocal time. The space variab les have 
entirely d isappeared. So,  it that way, it's simplified. It's simplified conceptually, and 
now, you can answer the same type of questions we asked before about this. 

I think it would be better for us to move on, though. Well, just an example, one 
really simp le thing, so, suppose since we spent so much time worrying about what 
was happening w ith sinusoid inputs, I mean, when could Ce be sinusoida l, for 
example? Well, roughly sinusoidal  if,  for examp le, some factory were polluting. If this 
were a lake, and some factory were polluting  it, but in the beginning, at the 
beginning of the day, they produced a lot of the pollutant, and by the end of the day 

when it wound down, it might well happen that the concentration of pollutants in the 
incoming stream would vary sinusoida lly with a 24 hour cycle. 

And then, we would be asking, so, suppose this varies sinusoida lly. In other words, 
it's like cos(omega t). I'm asking, how closely does the concentration in the tank 
follow Ce? Now, what would that depend upon? Think about it. Well,  the answer, 
suppose k is large. C losely, let's just analyze one case, if k is b ig. Now, what would 
make k big? We know that from  the temperature thing. If the conductivity is high, 
then the inner temperature will follow the outer temperature closely, and the same 
thing w ith the d iffusion model. But we, of course, therefore, since the equation is the 
same, we must get the same result here. Now, what would make k b ig? If r is big, if 
the flow rate is very fast, we will expect the concentration of the inside of that tank 
to match  fairly closely the concentration of the pollutant, of the incoming salt 
solution, or, if the tank is very small. 

For fixed flow  rates, if the tank is very sma ll, well, then it gets emptied quickly. So, 
both of these are, I think, intuitive results. And, of course, as before, we got them 
from that, by trying to ana lyze the fina l form of the solution. In other words, we got 
them by looking at that form of the solution up there, and seeing if k is big. As k 
increases, what happens to the amplitude, and what happens to the phase lag? But, 
that summarizes the two. So, this means, closely means, that the phase  lag is, b ig 
or small? The lag is small. And, the amplitude is, well, the amp litude, the biggest the 
amplitude could ever be  is one because that's the amplitude of this. 

So, the amp litude is near one, one because that's the amp litude of the incoming 
signa l, input, whatever you want to ca ll it. Okay, now, I'd like to spend the rest of 
the time talking about the failures of number one, and when you have to use number 
two, and when even number two is no good. So, let me end first-order equations by 
putting my worst foot forward. Well, I'm just trying to avoid disappointment at 
misapprehensions from you. I'll watch you leave this room and say, well, he said 
that, okay. So, the first one you're going to encounter very shortly where one  is not 
satisfied, but two is, so on some examples where you need two, well, it's going to 
happen right here. 

Somebody, sooner or later, it's going to draw on that loathsome orange chalk, which 
is unerasable, something which looks like that. Remember, you saw it here first. r, 
yeah, we had that. Okay, see, I had it in high school too. That's the capacitance. This 
is the resistance. That's the electromotive force: battery, or a source of alternating 
current, something like that. Now, of course, what you're interested in is how the 
current flows in the circuit. Since current across the capacitance doesn't make sense, 
you have to ta lk about the charge on the capacitance. So, q, it's customary in a 
circle this simple to use as the variable not current, but the charge on the 
capacitance. 

And then Kirchhoff's, you are also supposed to know that the derivative, that the 
time derivative of q is what's called the current in the circuit. That sort of intuitive. 
But,  i in a physics class, j in an electrica l engineering class, and why, not the letter Y, 
but why  is that? That's because of electrica l engineers use lots of lots of comp lex 
numbers and therefore, you have to ca ll current j, I guess. I think they do j  in 
physics, too, now. No, no they don't. I don't know. So, i is ambiguous if you are in 
that particular sub ject. And it's customary to use, I don't know. 

Now it's completely safe. Okay, where are we? Well, the law  is, the basic differentia l 
equation is Kirchhoff's voltage law, but the sum of the voltage drops across these 
three has to be zero. So, it's R times i, which is dq / dt. That's Ohm's law. That's the 
voltage drop across resistance. The voltage drop across the capacitance is Coulomb's 
law, one form of Coulomb's law. It's q divided by C. And, that has to be the voltage 
drop. And then, there is some sign convention. 

So, this  is either p lus or minus, depending on your sign conventions, but it's E of t. 
Now, if I put that in standard form, in standard form I probab ly should say q' + q/RC 
= E/R. And, this is what would appear in the equation. But, it's not the natura l thing. 
The k = 1 / RC. And, that's the reciproca l. The RC constant is what everybody knows 
is important when you ta lk about a little circuit of that form. On the other hand, the 
right-hand side, it's quite unnatural to try to stick in the right-hand side that same 
RC. Call this EC over RC. Peop le don't do that, and therefore, it doesn't really fall into 
the paradigm of that first equation. It's the second equation that really falls into the 
category. Another simp le example of this  is chained to k, rad ioactively changed to k. 

Well, let's say the radioactive substance, A, decays into, let's say, one atom of this 
produces one atom of that for simplicity. So, it decays into B, which then still is 
radioactive and decays further. Okay, what's the differential equation, which  is going 
to be, it's going to govern this situation? What I want to know is how much B there is 
at any given time. So, I want a differential equation  for the quantity of the 
radioactive product at any given time. Well, what's it going  to look like? Well,  it's the 
amount coming in minus the amount going out, so to speak. The rate of inflow minus 
the rate of outflow, except it's not the same type of physical flow we had before. 
How fast is it coming in? Well, A is decaying at a certa in rate, and so the rate at 
which A decays is by the basic radioactive  law. 

It's k1, it's constant, decay constant, times the amount of A present . If I used the 
differentia l equation with A here, I'd have to put a negative sign because it's the rate 
at which that stuff is leaving A. But, I'm interested in the rate at which it's coming in 
to B. So, it has a positive sign. And then, the rate at which B is decaying, and 
therefore the quantity of good B is gone, --

-- that w ill have some other constant, B. So, that w ill be the equation, and to avoid 
having two dependent variables in there, we know how A is decaying. So, it's k1, 
some constant times A, sorry, A will be e to  the negative, you know, the decay law, 
so, times the initial amount that was there, A0 e^(-k1t). That's how much A there is 
at any given time. It's decaying by the radioactive decay law, -k2 B. Okay, so how 
does the differential equation look like? It looks  like B' + k2B = k1 A0 e^(-k1 t). But, 
there's no reason to expect that that constant really has anything to do w ith k2. It's 
unnatural to put it in that form, which is the correct one. 

Now, in the last two minutes, I w ish to alienate half the class by pointing out that if k 
is less than zero, none of the terminology of transient, steady-state input response 
applies. The technique of solving the equation  is identical. But, you cannot interpret. 
So, the technique is the same, and therefore it's worth learning. The technique is the 
same. In other words, the solution will be still e^(-kt) integra l(q(t) e^(kt) dt) plus a 
constant times e to the k, oh, this is terrible, no. 

dy / dt, let's g ive an example. The equation I'm going to look at is something that 
looks like this: y equals q of t,  let's say, okay, a constant, but the constant a is 
positive. So, the constant here is negative. Then, when I solve, my k, in other words, 

is now properly written as negative a. And therefore, this formula should now 
become not this, but the -k = at. And, here it's negative a t. And, here it is positive a 
t. Now, why is  it, if this is going to be the solution, why are a ll those things totally 
irrelevant? This is not a transient any longer because if a is positive, this goes to 
infinity. Or, if I go to minus  infinity, then C is negative. 

So, it's not transient. It's not going to zero, and  it depends heavily on the initia l 
cond itions. That means that of these two functions, this is the important guy. This is 
just fixed, some fixed  function. Everything, in other words, is going to depend upon 
the initia l conditions, whereas in the other cases we have been studying, the initia l 
cond itions after a while don't matter anymore. Now, why did I say I would a lienate 
half of you? Well, because in what subjects will a be positive? In what sub jects will k 
be negative? k is typ ically negative in b iology, economics, Sloan. In other words, the 
simple thing is think of it in biology. What's the simplest equation  for population 
growth? Well, it is dP / dt equals some, if the population is growing, a times P, and a 
is a positive number. 

That means P prime minus a P is zero. So, the thing I want to leave you w ith  is this. 
If life is involved, k is likely to be negative. k is positive when inanimate things are 
involved; I won't say dead, inanimate.
