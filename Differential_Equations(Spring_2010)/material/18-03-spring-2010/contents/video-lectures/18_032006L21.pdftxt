18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript – Lecture 21 

Today is going to be one of the more d ifficult  lectures of the term. So, put on your 
thinking caps, as they would say in elementary school. The topic is going to be 
what's ca lled a convolution. The convolution is something very peculiar that you do 
to two functions to get a third function. It has its own specia l symbol. f(t) asterisk is 
the universa l symbol that's used  for that. So, this is a new function of t, which bears 
very little resemblance to the ones, f of t, that you started w ith. I'm going to give 
you the formula  for it, but first, there are two ways of motivating it, and both are 
important. 

There  is a formal motivation, which  is why it's tucked into the section on Lap lace 
transform. And, the forma l motivation is the following. Suppose we start with the 
Laplace transform of those two functions. Now, the most natura l question to ask is, 
since Laplace transforms are rea lly a pain to calculate is from old Laplace transforms, 
is it easy to get new ones? And, the first thing, of course, summing functions is easy. 
That g ives you the sum of the transforms. But, a more natural question would be, 
suppose I want to multiply F(t) and G(t). Is there, hopefully, some neat formula? If I 
multip ly the product of the, take the product of these two, is there some neat 
formula for the Laplace transform of that product? That would simp ly life greatly. 
And, the answer is, there is no such  formula. And there never will be. 

Well, we w ill not give up entirely. Suppose we ask the other question. Suppose 
instead I multiply the Laplace transforms. Could that be related to something I cook 
up out of F(t) and G(t)? Could it be the transform of something I cook up out of F of 
t or G of t? And, that's what the convolution is for. The answer is that F(s)*G(s) 
turns out to be the Lap lace transform of the convolution. 

The convolution, and that's one way of defining it, is the function of t you should put 
it there in order that its Lap lace transform turn out to be the product of F(s)*G(s). 
Now, I'll give you, in a moment, the formula  for it. But, I'll give you one and a 
quarter minutes, well, two minutes of motivation as to why there should be such 
formula. Now, I won't ca lculate this out to the end because I don't have time. But, 
here's the reason why there should be such formula. And, you might suspect, and 
therefore it would be worth looking for. It's because, remember, I told you where the 
Laplace transform came from, that the Laplace transform was the continuous analog 
of a power series. 

So, when you ask a genera l question like that, the place to look for is if you know an 
analogous  idea, say, does it work. something like that work there? So, here I have a 
power series summation, (a)n x^n. Remember, you can write this in computer 
notation as a(n) to make it look like f(n),  f(t). And, the analog  is turned into t when 
you turn a power series into the Lap lace transform, and x --> e^(-s), and one 
formula just turns into the other. 

Okay, so, there's a  formula for F(x). This is the analog of the Laplace transform. And, 
similarly, G(x) here  is summation (b)n x^n. Now, again, the naÃ¯ve question would 

be, well, suppose I multiply the two corresponding coefficients together, and add up 
that power series, summation (a)n b(n) x^n. Is that somehow, that sum related to F 
and G? And, of course, everybody knows the answer to that is no. It has no relation 
whatever. But, suppose instead I multiply these two guys. In that case, I'll get a new 
power series. I don't know what its coefficients are, but let's write them down. Let's 
just ca ll them (c)n's. So, what I'm asking is, this corresponds to the product of the 
two Laplace transforms. 

And, what I want to know is, is there a formula which says that (c)n is equal to 
something that can be ca lculated out of the (a)i and the (b)j. Now, the answer to 
that is, yes, there is. And, the formula  for (c)n is ca lled the convolution. Now, you 
could figure out this formula yourself. You figure it out. Anyone who 's smart enough 
to be interested in the question in the first place is smart enough to figure out what 
that formula is. And,  it will give you great pleasure to see that it's just like the 
formula for the convolution of going to give you now. So, what is that formula  for the 
convolution? Okay, hang on. Now, you are not going to like it. 

But, you didn't like the formula  for the Laplace transform, either. You felt w iser, 
grown-up getting it. But it's a mouthful to swa llow. It's something you get used to 
slowly. And, you will get used to the convolution equally slow ly. So, what is the 
convolution of f(t) * g(t)? It's a function ca lculated according to the corresponding 
formula. It's a  function of t. 

Integral from 0 to t of [f(u) g(t - u) dt]. That's it. I didn't make it up. I'm just varying 
the bad news. Well, what do you do when you see a  formula? Well, the first thing to 
do, of course,  is try ca lculating just to get some feeling for what kind of a thing, you 
know. Let's try some examples. Let's see, let's calculate, what would be a modest 
beginning? Let's calcu late the convolution of t with itself. Or, better yet, let's 
calculate the convolution just so  that you could tell the difference, t with t squared, t 
squared w ith t, to make it a little easier. 

By the way, the convolution  is symmetric. f * g = g * f. Let's put that down 
exp licitly. I forgot to last period. So, tell all the guys who came to the one o 'clock 
lecture that you know something that they don't. Now,  that's a theory. It's 
commutative. This operation is commutative, in other words. Now, that has to be a 
theorem because the formula is not symmetric. 

The formula does not treat f and g equa lly. And therefore, this  is not obvious. It's at 
least not obvious  if you look at  it that way, but it is obvious if you look at it that way. 
Why? In other words,  f * g  is the guy whose Lap lace transform is F(s) G(s). Well, 
what would g *  f be? That would be the guy whose Laplace transform is G*F. But FG 
= GF. So, it's because the Lap lace transforms are commutative. Ordinary 
multip lication is commutative. It follows that this has to be commutative, too. So, I'll 
write that down, since F times G is equa l to GF. And, you have to understand that 
here, I mean that these are the Lap lace transforms of those guys. 

But,  it's not obvious from the formula. Okay, let's ca lculate the Lap lace transform of, 
sorry, the convolution of t*, let's do it by the formula. All right, by the formula, I 
calculate integra l zero to t. Now, I take the first function, but I change its variable to 
the dummy variable, u. So, that's u^2. I take the second  function and replace its 
variable by u - t. 

So, this  is times t - u, sorry. Okay, do you see that to calculate this is what I have to 
write down? That's what the formula becomes. Anything wrong? Oh, sorry, the du, 
the integration's w ith expect to u, of course. Thanks very much. Okay, let's do it. So, 
it is, integra l of u^2 t is, remember, it's integrated with respect to u. So, it's u^3 / 3 
* t. The rest of it is the integra l of u^3, which  is u^4 / 4. All this is to be evaluated 
between zero and t at the upper limit. So, I put u = t, I get t^4 / 3 - t^4 / 4. 

Of course, at the lower limit, u = 0. So, both of these are terms of zero. There's 
nothing there. And, the answer is, therefore, t^4 d ivided by, 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12. So, 
that's doing it from the formula. But, of course,  there is an easier way to do it. We 
can cheat and use the Laplace transform instead. If I Laplace transform it, the 
L(t^2) is what? It's 2! / s^3. The L(t) is 1 / s^2. And so, because this is the 
convolution of these, it should correspond to the product of the Laplace transforms, 
which is 2 / s^5. 

Well, is that the same as this? What's the Laplace transform of, in other words, 
what's the inverse Laplace transform of L^(-1) (2 / s^5)? Well, the inverse L^(-1) 
(4! / s^5) is how much? That's t^4 , right? Now, how does this d iffer? Well, to turn 
that into that, I should divide by four times three. So, this should be 1/12 t^4, one 
over four times three because this is 24, and that's two, so, d ivide by 12 to 
determine what constant, yeah. So, it works, at least in that case. But now, notice 
that this is not an ordinary product. The convolution of t^2 and t is not something 
like t^3. It's something like t to the forth, and there's a  funny constant in there, too, 
very unpredictab le. 

Let's look at the convolution. Let's take another example of the convolution. Let's do 
something rea lly humble just assure you that this, even at the simplest example, this 
is not trivia l. Let's take the convolution of f(t) with one. Can you take, yeah, one is a 
function just like any function. But, you get something out of the convolution, yes, 
yes. Let's just write down the formula. Now, I can't use the Laplace transform here 
because you won't know what to do with it. You don't have that formula yet. It's a 
secret one that only I know. So, let's do it. Let's ca lculate it out the way it was 
supposed to. So, it's the  integral from zero to t of f(u), and now, what do I do w ith 
that one? I'm supposed to take, one  is the function g(t), and wherever I see a t, I'm 
supposed to plug  in t - u. 

Well, I don't see any t there. But that's something for rejoicing. There's nothing to do 
to make the substitution. It's just one. So, the answer is, it's this curious thing. The 
convolution of a function with one, you integrate it from zero to t. Well, as they said 
in Alice in Wonderland, things are getting curiouser and curiouser. I mean, what is 
going on with this crazy function, and where are we supposed to start with it? Well, 
I'm going to prove this for you, mostly because the proof is easy. In other words, I'm 
going to prove that that's true. 

And, as I g ive the proof, you'll see where the convolution is coming  from. That's 
number one. And, number two, the rea l reason I'm giving you the proof: because it's 
a marvelous exercise in chang ing the variables in a doub le  integral. Now, that's 
something you a ll know how to do, even the ones who are taking 18.02 concurrently, 
and I d idn't advise you to do that. But, I've arranged the course so it's possib le to 
do. But, I knew that by the time we got to this, you would already know how to 
change variables at a double integra l. 

So, and in  fact, you will have the advantage of remembering how to do it because 
you just had it about a week or two ago, whereas a ll the other guys, it's something 
dim in their d istance. So, I'm reviewing how to change variables at a double integral. 
I'm show ing you it's good for something. So, what we are out to try to prove is this 
formula. Let's put that down in, so you understand. Okay, let's do  it. Now, we'll use 
the desert island method. So, you have as much time as you want. You're on a 
desert  island. In fact, I'm going to even go it the opposite way. I'm going to start 
with-- you've got a lot of time on your hands and say, gee, I wonder if I take the 
product of the Lap lace transforms, I wonder if there's some crazy function I could 
put in there, which would make things work. 

You've never heard of the convolution. You're going to discover it all by yourself. 
Okay, so how do you begin? So, we'll start with the left hand side. We're looking for 
some nice way of calculating that as the Laplace transform of a single function. So, 
the way to begin is by writing out the definitions. We couldn't use anything else since 
we don't have anything else to use. Now, looking ahead, I'm going to not use t. I'm 
going to use two neutral variables when I ca lculate. After all, the t is just a dummy 
variable anyway. 

You will see in a minute the wisdom of doing this. So,  it's this times the integral, 
which gives the Lap lace transform of g. So, that's e to the negative s v, let's say, 
times g of v, dv. Okay, everybody can get that far. But now we have to start looking. 
Well, this is a sing le integral, an 18.01 integral involving u, and this is an 18.01 
integral involving v. But when you take the product of two integrals like that, 
remember when you eva luate a doub le integral, there's an easy case where it's 
much easier than any other case. If you could write the inside, if you are integrating 
over a  rectangle,  for examp le, and you can write the integra l as a product of a 
function just of u, and a product of a function just as v, then the integra l is very easy 
to evaluate. 

You can forget a ll the rules. You just take all the u part out, a ll the v part out, and 
integrate them separately, a to b, c to d. That's the easy case of evaluating a double 
integral. It's what everybody tries to do, even when it's not appropriate. Now, here it 
is appropriate, except I'm going to use it backwards. This  is the result of having done 
that. If this is the result of having done it, what was the step just before it? 

Well, I must have been trying to evaluate a double integral as u runs from zero to 
infinity and v runs from zero to infinity, of what? Well, of the product of these two 
functions. Now, what is that? e^(-su)*e^(-sv). Well, I must surely want to comb ine 
those. e to the minus s u times e to the minus s v. And, what's  left? Well, what gets 
dragged a long? du dv. This is the same as that because of that law I just gave you 
this is the product of a  function just of u, and a  function just of v. And therefore, it's 
okay to separate the two integra ls out that way because I'm integrating sort of a 
rectangle that goes to infinity that way and infinity that way. But, what I'm 
integrating is over the plane, in other words, this region of the p lane as u, v goes 
from zero to infinity, zero to infinity. 

Now, let's take a look. What are we looking for? Well, we're looking  for, we would be 
very happy if u + v = t. Let's make it t. In other words, I'm introducing a new 
variable, t, u p lus v, and it's suggested by the form in which I'm looking  for the 
answer. Now, of course you then have to, we need another variable. We could keep 
either u or v. Let's keep u. That means v, we just gave a musica l cha irs. v got 

dropped out. Well, we can't have three variables. We only have room  for two. But, 
we will remember it. Rest in peace, v = t - u in case we ever need him again. 

Okay, let's now put in the limits. Let's put in the integra l, the rest of the change of 
variable. So, I'm now chang ing it to these new variab les, t and u, so it's e^(-st). 
Well, f(u) I don't have to do anything to. But, g(v), I'm not allowed to keep v, so v 
has to be changed to t - u. Amaz ing things are happening. Now, I want to change 
this to an integral du dt. Now, for that, you have to be a little careful. We have two 
things to do  to figure out this; what goes w ith that? And, we have to put in the 
limits, also. Now, those are the two nontrivia l operations, when you change variables 
in a double integra l. So,  let's be rea lly careful. 

Let's do the easier of the two, first. I want to change from du dv to du dt. And now, 
to do that, you have to put in the Jacobian matrix, the Jacobian determinant. Ah-ha! 
How many of you  forgot that? I won't even bother asking. Oh, come on, you only 
lose two points. It doesn't matter if you put it in the Jacobian. As you see, you're 
going to  forget something. You w ill lose less credit for forgetting than anything else. 
So, it's the Jacob ian of u and v with respect to u and t. So, to ca lculate that, you 
write u equa ls u, v = t - u, and then the Jacobian is the partial of the matrix, the 
determinant of partial derivatives. 

So, it's the determinant whose entries are the partial of u w ith respect to u, the 
partial of u w ith respect to t, but these are independent variab les. So, that's zero. 
The partia l of v w ith respect to u is negative one. The partial of v with respect to t  is 
one. So, the Jacobian is one. So, if you forgot it, no harm. So, the Jacob ian is one. 
Now, more serious, and in some ways, I think, for most of you, the most difficult 
part of the operation, is putting in the new limits. Now, for that, you look at the 
region over which you're integrating. I think I'd better do that carefully. I need a 
bigger picture. That's rea lly what I'm trying to say. So, here's the (u, v) coordinates. 
And, I want to change these to (u, t) coordinates. The integration is over the first 
quadrant. 

So, what you do is, when you do the integral, the first step is u is varying, and t is 
held fixed. So,  in the first integration, u varies. t is held fixed. Now, what is holding t 
fixed in this p icture mean? Well, t = u + v. So, u plus v is fixed, is a constant, in 
other words. Now, where are the curves along which u + v is a constant? Well, they 
are these lines. These are the  lines along which u plus v equals a constant, or t is a 
constant. The reason I'm hold ing t a constant is because the first integration only 
allows u to change. t is held  fixed. Okay, you let u increase. As u increases, and t  is 
held fixed, I'm traversing these lines  in this d irection. 

That's the d irection on which u is increasing. I integrate from the point, from  the u 
value where they leave the region. And, to enter the reg ion, what's the u value 
where they enter the region? u is equa l to zero. Everybody would know that. Not so 
many peop le would be ab le to figure out what to put for where it leaves the reg ion. 
What's the va lue of u when it  leaves the region? Well, this is the curve, v = 0. But, v 
equa ls zero is, in another language, u = t.  t - u = 0, or u equals t. In other words, 
they enter the region where u = 0, and they leave where u is t, has the va lue of t. 

And, how about the other guys? For which t's do I want to do this? Well, I want to do 
it for all these t values. Well, now, the t va lue here, that's the starting one. Here, t is 
zero, and here t is not zero. And, if I go out and cover the whole first quadrant, I'll 
be letting t increase to infinity. The sum of u and v, I w ill be letting increase to 

infinity. So,  it's zero to infinity. So, a ll this is an exercise in taking this doub le 
integral in (u, v) coordinates, and changing it to this double integra l, an equivalent 
double integra l over the same region, but now in (u,  t) coord inates. And now, that's 
the answer. Somewhere here is the answer because, look, since the first integration 
is with respect to u,  this guy can migrate outside because it doesn't involve u. 

That only involves t, and t is only caught by the second integration. So, I can put this 
outside. And, what do I end up with? The Integral from 0 to infinity of [e^(-st)], 
what's left? A funny expression, but you're on your desert island and found it. This 
funny expression, Integra l from 0 to t of [f(u) g(t - u)], in short, the convolution, 
exactly the convolution. 

So, all you have to do is get the idea that there might be a formula, sit down, change 
variables and double integral it, ego, you've got your formula. Well, I would like to 
spend much of the rest of the period--- in other words, that's how it relates to the 
Laplace transform. That's how it comes out of the Laplace transform. Here's how to 
use it, calculate it either with the Laplace transform or directly from the integral. 
And, of course, you will solve prob lems, Laplace transform problems, differentia l 
equations using the convolution. But, I have to tell you that most people, convolution 
is very important. And, most people who use it don't use it in connection with the 
Laplace transform. They use it for its own sake. The first p lace I learned that outside 
of MIT people used a convolution was actually from my daughter. 

She's an environmental eng ineer, an environmental consultant. She does risk 
assessment, and stuff like that. But anyway, she had this paper on acid rain she was 
trying to read for a client, and she said something about ca lculating acid  rain  falls on 
soil. And  then,  from there, the stuff leeches into a river. But, things happen to it on 
the way. Soil combines in various ways, reduces the acidity, and things happen. 
Chemical reactions take place, b lah, blah, blah, blah. Anyways, she said, well, then 
they calculated in the end how much the river gets polluted. But, she sa id it's 
convolution. She sa id, what's the convolution? So, I told her she was too young to 
learn about the convolution. And she knows that I thought I'd better look  it up first. I 
mean, I, of course, knew the convolution was, but I was a little puzzled at that 
application of it. So, I read the paper. It was interesting. 

And, in thinking about it, other peop le have come to me, some guy with a prob lem 
about, they drilled ice cores in the North Pole, and from the radioactive carbon and 
so on, deducing various things about the climate 60 b illion years ago, and it was all 
convolution. He asked me if I could expla in that to him. So, let me g ive you sort of 
all-purpose thing, a simple all-purpose model, which can be adapted, which is very 
good way of thinking of the convolution, in my opinion. 

It's a prob lem of radioactive dump ing. It's  in the notes, by the way. So, I'm just, if 
you want to take a chance, and just listen to what I'm saying  rather that just 
scribbling everything down, maybe you'll be able to figure it out for the notes, also. 
So, the problem is we have some factory, or a nuclear plant, or some thing like that, 
is producing radioactive waste, not always at the same rate. And then, it carts it, 
dumps it on a pile somewhere. So, rad ioactive waste is dumped, and there's a 
dumping function. I'll call that f(t), the dump rate. 

That's the dumping rate. Let's say t is  in years. You like to have units, and quantity, 
kilograms, I don't know, whatever you want. Now, what does the dumping rate 
mean? The dump ing  rate means that if I have two times that are close together,  for 

example, two successive days, midnight on two successive days, then there's a time 
interva l between them. I'll ca ll that delta t. To say the dump ing  rate is f(t) means 
that the amount dumped in this time interva l, in the time interva l from t1 --> t1 + 1 
is approximately, not exactly, because the dumping rate isn't even constant w ithin 
this time interval. 

But it's approximately the dumping rate times the time over which the dumping is 
taking p lace. That's what I mean by the dump rate. And, it gets more and more 
accurate, the sma ller the time interval you take. Okay, now here's my problem. The 
problem is, you start dumping at time t = 0. At time t equal t, how much rad ioactive 
waste is in the p ile? Now, what makes that prob lem slightly complicated is 
radioactive waste decays. If I put some at a certain day, and then go back severa l 
months later and nothing's happened in between, I don't have the same amount that 
I dumps because a  fraction of it decayed. 

I have less. And, our answer to the problem must take account of, for each p iece of 
waste, how long it has been in the p ile because that takes account of how long it had 
to decay, and what it ends up as. So, the calculation, the essential part of the 
calculation will be that  if you have an initia l amount of this substance, and it decays 
for a time, t, this is the amount left at time t. This is the law of rad ioactive decay. 
You knew that coming into 18.03, a lthough, it's, of course, a simple differentia l 
equation which produces  it, but I'll assume you simply know the answer. 

k depends on the material, so I'm going to assume that the nuclear p lant dumps the 
same radioactive substance each time. It's only one substance I'm ca lculating, and k 
is it. So, assume the k is fixed. I don't have to change from one k from one materia l 
to a k for another because it's mixing up the stuff, just one material. Okay, and now 
let's calculate it. Here's the idea. I'll take the t-axis, but now I'm going to change  its 
name to the u-axis. You will see why in just a second. It starts at zero. I'm 
interested in what's happening at the time, t. How much is left at time t? So, I'm 
going to divide up the  interval from zero to t on this time axis into, well, here's u0, 
the starting point, u1, u2, let's make this u1. 

Oh, curses! u1, u2, u3, and so on. Let's call this (u)n. So they're u(n + 1), not that it 
matters. It doesn't matter. Okay, now, the amount, so, what I'm going to do is look 
at the amount,  take the time interva l from u(i) --> u(i + 1). This is a time interval, 
delta u. Divide it up into equa l time intervals. So, the amount dumped in the time 
interva l from u(i) --> u(i + 1) is equa l to approximately f(u(i)), the dumping function 
there, times delta u. 

We ca lculated that before. That's what the meaning of the dump ing  rate is. By time 
t, how much has it decayed to? It has decayed. How much is left, in other words? 
Well, this is the starting amount. So, the answer is going to be it's f of (u) i times 
delta u times this factor, which tells how much  it decays, so,  time. So, this is the 
starting amount at time (u)i. That's when it was first dumped, and this is the amount 
that was dumped, times, multiply that by e^(-k) times, now, what should  I put up in 
there? I have to put the length of time that it had to decay. What is the length of 
time that it had to decay? 

It was dumped at u(i). I'm looking at time, t, it decayed for time length t - ui, the 
length of time it had all the pile. So, the stuff that was dumped in this time interva l, 
at time t when I come to look at  it, this is how much of it is left. And now, all I have 
to do is add up that quantity for this time, the stuff that was dumped in this time 

interva l plus the stuff dumped in, and so on, a ll the way up to the stuff that was 
dumped yesterday. And, the answer w ill be the tota l amount left at time, t, that is 
not yet decayed will be approximately, you add up the amount coming from the first 
time interva l p lus the amount coming, and so on. 

So, it w ill be f(u( i)) e^(-k*(t - u(i))) * Delta u. So, these two parts represent the 
amount dumped, and this is the decay factor. And, I had those up as I runs from, 
well, where did  I start? From 1 --> n, let's say. And now, let delta t go to zero, in 
other words, make this delta u go to zero, make this more accurate by taking finer 
and finer subdivisions. In other words, instead of looking every month to see how 
much was dumped, let's look every week, every day, and so on, to make this 
calculation more accurate. And,  the answer is, this approach is the exact amount, 
which will be the integra l. 

This sum is a Riemann sum. It approaches the  integra l from zero to, well, I'm adding 
it up from u1 = 0 --> un = t, the fina l value. So, it w ill be the integral from the 
starting point to the ending point of f(u) e^(-k(t - u)) du. That's the answer to the 
problem. It's given by this rather funny looking integra l. But, from this point of view, 
it's entirely natural. It's a combination of the dumping  function. This doesn't care 
what the material was. It only wants to know how much was put on everyday. And, 
this part, which doesn't care how much was put on each day, it just is an intrinsic 
constant of the material involving its decay rate. 

And, this tota l thing represents the total amount. And that  is, what is it? It's the 
convolution of f(t) w ith what function? e^(-kt). It's the convolution of the dumping 
function and the decay function. And, the convolution is exactly the operation that 
you have to have to do that. Okay, so, I think this is the most intuitive physica l 
approach to the meaning of the convolution. 

In this particular, you can say, well, that's very special. Okay, so it tells you what the 
meaning of the convolution w ith an exponentia l is. But, what about the convolution 
with all the other functions we're going to have to use in this course. They can all be 
interpreted just by being a little flexib le in your approach. I'll g ive you two examples 
of this, well, three. First of a ll, I'll use it for, in the problem set I ask you about a 
bank account. 

That's not something any of you are interested in. Okay, so, suppose instead I 
dumped garbage -- -- undecaying. So, something that doesn't decay at all, what's 
the answer going to be? Well, the ca lculation will be exactly the same. It will be the 
convolution of the dumping function. The only d ifference is that now the garbage 
isn't going to decay. So, no matter how long it's left, the same amount is going to be 
left at the end. In other words, I don't want to exponentia l decay function. I want to 
function, one, the constant function, one, because once I stick it on the pile, nothing 
happens to it. It just stays there. So, it's going to be the convolution of this one 
because this is constant. It's undecaying --

-- by the identica l reasoning. And so, what's the answer going to be? It's going to be 
the Integra l from 0 to t of f(u) du. Now, that's an 18.01 problem. If I dump with a 
dumping rate,  f(u), and I dump from time zero to time t, how much is on the p ile? 
They don't give it. They a lways give velocity problems, and prob lems of how to slice 
up bread loaves, and stuff like that. But, this is a rea l life prob lem. 

If that's the dumping  rate, and you dump for t days from zero to time t, how much 
do you have left at the end? Answer: the Integral from 0 to t of [f(u) du]. I'll give 
you another example. Suppose I wanted a dumping function, suppose I wanted a 
function, wanted to interpret something which grows like t, for instance. All I want is 
a physical interpretation. 

Well, I have to think, I'm making a pile of something, a metaphorical pile, we don't 
actually have to make a physical pile. And, the thing should be growing like t. Well, 
what grows like t? Not bacteria, they grow exponentia lly. Before the lecture, I was 
trying to think of something. So, I came up w ith chickens on a chicken farm. Little 
baby chickens grow linearly. All  little animals, anyway, I've observed that babies 
grow linearly, at least for a while, thank God. After a while, they taper off. 

But, at the beg inning, they eat every four hours or whatever. And they eat the same 
amount, pretty much. And, that adds up. So, let's suppose this represents the linear 
growth of chickens, of baby chicks. That makes them sound cuter, less offensive. 
Okay, so, a farmer, chicken farmer, whatever they call them, is starting a new 
brood. So anyway, the hens lay at a certa in rate, and each of those are incubated. 
And after a while, little baby chicks come out. So, this will be the production rate for 
new chickens. 

Okay, and it w ill be the convolution which will tell you at time, t, the number of 
kilograms. We'd better do  this in kilograms, I'm afra id. Now, that's not as heartless 
as it seems. The number of kilograms of chickens times t. [LAUGHTER] It really isn't 
heartless because, after a ll, why would the farmer want to know that? Well, because 
a certa in number of pounds of chicken eat a certain number of pounds of chicken 
feed, and that's how much he has to dump, must have to give them every day. 
That's how he calculates his expenses. 

So, he w ill have to know the convolution is, or better yet, he w ill hire you, who 
knows what the convolution is. And you'll be able to tell him. Okay, why don't we 
stop there and go to recitation tomorrow. I'll be doing important things.
