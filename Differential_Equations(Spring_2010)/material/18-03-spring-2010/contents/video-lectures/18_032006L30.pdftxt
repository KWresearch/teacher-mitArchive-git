18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 30 

Everything I say today is going to be for n-by-n systems, but for your calculations 
and the exams two-by-two w ill be good enough. Our system looks like that. Notice I 
am talking today about the homogeneous system, not the inhomogenous system. 
So, homogenous. 

And we have so  far two basic methods of solving it. The first one, on which we spent 
the most time, is the method of where you calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix, 
the eigenvectors, and put them together to make the genera l solution. So 
eigenvalues, e-vectors and so on. 

The second method, which I gave you last time, I called "royal road," simp ly 
calculates the matrix e^(At) and says that the solution is e^(At) x0, the initial 
cond ition. That is very elegant. The only problem is that to calculate the matrix e to 
the At, although sometimes you can do it by its definition as an infinite series, most 
of the time the only way to calculate the matrix e to the At is by using  the 
fundamenta l matrix. 

In other words, the normal way of doing it is you have to calculate it as the 
fundamenta l matrix time normalized at zero. So, as I expla ined at the end of  last 
time and you practiced in the recitations, you have to find the fundamenta l matrix, 
which, of course, you have to do by eigenvalues and eigenvectors. And then you 
multip ly it by its va lue at zero, inverse. And that, by magic, turns out to be the same 
as the exponential matrix. 

But, of course, there has been no gain in simp licity or no ga in in ease of ca lculation. 
The only difference is that the language has been changed. Now, today is going to be 
devoted to yet another method which saves no work at all and only amounts to a 
change of language. The only reason I give it to you is because I have been begged 
by various eng ineering departments to do so --

-- because that is the language they use. In other words, each person who solves 
systems, some like to use fundamental matrices, some just calculate, some 
immed iately convert the system by elimination into a single higher order equation 
because they are more comfortable with that. Some, especially if they are writing 
papers, they ta lk exponentia l matrices. 

But there are a certa in number of eng ineers and scientists who talk decoupling, 
express the prob lem and the answer in terms of decoupling. And that is, therefore, 
what I have to expla in to you today. So, the third method, today's method, I stress 
is rea lly no more than a change of language. And I feel a little guilty about the whole 
business. 

Instead of going more deep ly into studying these equations, what I am doing is like 
giving a  language course and teaching you how  to say hello and good-bye in French, 
German, Spanish, and Italian. It is not going very deeply into any of those 

languages, but you are going into the outside world, where people will speak these 
things. Here is an introduction to the language of decoup ling in which for some 
people is the exclusive language in which they talk about systems. 

Now, I think the best way to, well, in a general way, what you try to do is as follows. 
You try to introduce new variab les. You make a change of variab les. I am going to do 
it two-by-two just to save a lot of writing out. And it's going to be a linear change of 
variables because we are interested in linear systems. 

The problem is to  find u and v such that something wonderful happens, such that 
when you make the change of variab les to express this system in terms of u and v  it 
becomes decoupled. And that means the system turns into a system which looks like 
u' = k1 u and v' = k2 v. 

Such a system is ca lled decoupled. Why? Well, a normal system is called coup led. 
Let's write out what it would be. Well, let's not write that. You know what it looks 
like. This is decoupled because it is not rea lly a system at all. It is just two first-order 
equations sitting side by side and having nothing whatever to do with each other. 

This is two problems from the first day of the term. It is not one prob lem from the 
next to last day of the term, in other words. To solve this a ll you say is u is equa l to 
some constant times e^(k1 t) and v equa ls another constant times e^(k2 t). 

Coupled means that the x and y occur in both equations on the right-hand side. And, 
therefore, you cannot solve separately for x and y, you must solve together for both 
of them. Here I can solve separately for u and v and, therefore, the system has been 
decoup led. Now, obviously, if you can do that it's an enormous advantage, not just 
to the ease of solution, because you can write down the solution immediately, but 
because something physica l must be going on there. 

There must be some  insight. There ought to be some physical reason for these new 
variables. Now, that is where I p lan to start w ith. My p lan for the lecture is first to 
work out, in some detail, a specific examp le where decoup ling is done to show how 
that leads to the solution. And then we will go back and see how to do it  in genera l --

-- because you will see, as I do the decoup ling in this particular examp le,  that that 
particular method, though  it is suggested, will not work in general. I would need a 
more general method. But let's first go to  the example. It  is a slight mod ification of 
one you should have done in recitation. I don't think I worked one of these in the 
lecture, but to describe it I have to draw two views of it to make sure you know 
exactly what I am talking about. 

Sometimes it  is called the two compartment ice cube tray problem, a very old-
fashion type of ice cube tray. Not a modern one that is all p lastic where there is no 
leaking from one compartment to another. The old kind of ice cube trays, there were 
compartments and these were metal separated and you leveled the liquid because it 
could leak through the bottom that didn't go right to the bottom. If you don't know 
what I am ta lking about it makes no difference. 

This is the side view. This is meant to be twice as long. But, to make it quite clear, I 
will draw the top view of this thing. You have to  imagine this is a rectang le, a ll the 
sides are para llel and everything. This is one and this is two. All I am trying to say is 

that the cross-sectional area of these two chambers, this one has twice the cross-
sectional area of this one. 

So I will write a two here and I will write a one there. Of course,  it is this hole here 
through which everything leaks. I am going to let x be the height of this liquid, the 
water here, and y the height of the water in that chamber. Obviously, as time goes 
by, they both reach the same height because of somebody's law. Now, what is the 
system of differentia l equations that controls this? 

Well, the essentia l thing is the flow rate through here. That flow rate through the 
hole in units, let's say, in liters per second. Just so you understand, I am talking 
about the volume of liquid. I am not ta lking about the velocity. That is proportiona l 
to the area of the hole. 

So the cross-sectiona l area of the hole. And it is also times the velocity of the flow, 
but the velocity of the flow depends upon the pressure difference. And that pressure 
difference depends upon the difference in height. All those are various peop le's laws. 
So times the height d ifference. 

Of course, you have to get the sign right. I have just pointed out the height 
difference is proportional to the pressure at the hole. And it is that pressure at the 
hole that determines the velocity with which the fluid flows through. Where does this 
all produce our equations? Well, x prime is equa l to, therefore, some constant, 
depending on the area of the hole and this constant of proportionality w ith the 
pressure and the units and everything else times the pressure d ifference I am talking 
about. 

Well, if fluid is going to flow in this direction that must mean the y height is higher 
than the x height. So, to make x prime positive, it should be y - x here. Now, the y 
prime is different. 

Because, again, the rate of fluid flow is determined. This time, if y prime is positive, 
if this is rising, as it w ill be in this case, it's because the fluid is flow ing in that 
direction. It is because x is higher than y. So this should be the same constant x - y. 
But notice that right-hand side is the rate at which fluid is flow ing into this tank. That 
is not the rate at which y is changing. 

It is the rate at which 2y is changing. Why isn't there a constant here? There is. It's 
one. That is the one, this one cross-section. The area here is one and the cross-
sectional area here is two. And that is the reason for the one here and the two here, 
because we are interested in the rate at which  fluid is being added to this, which is 
only related to the height, the rate at which the height is rising  if you take into 
account the cross-sectional area. 

So there is the system. In order to use nothing but integers here, I am going to take 
c equals to two, so I don't have to put  in halves. The final system is x prime equals 
minus 2x, you have to write them in the correct order, and y prime equals, the twos 
cancel because c  is two, is x minus y. 

So there is our system. Now the prob lem is I want to solve it by decoup ling it. I 
want, in other words, to find new variab les, u and v, which are more natural to the 
problem than the x and y that are so natural to the prob lem that the new system w ill 
just consistently be two side-by-side equations instead of the sing le equation. 

The question is, what should u and v be? Now, the difference between what I am 
going to do now and what I am going to do later in the period is later in the period I 
will give you a systematic way of finding what u and v should be. Now we are going 
to psyche out what they should be in the way in which peop le who solve systems 
often do. I am going to use the fact that this is not just an abstract system of 
equations. It comes from some physica l prob lem. 

And I ask, is there some system of variab les, which somehow go more deeply into 
the structure of what's going on here than the naÃ¯ve variab les, which simp ly tell me 
how high the two tank levels are? That is the obvious thing I can see, but there are 
some variables that go more deeply. Now, one of them is sort of obvious and 
suggested both the form of the equation and by this. 

Simp ly, the difference  in heights is, in some ways, a more natura l variab le because 
that is directly related to the pressure difference, which is d irectly related to the 
velocity of flow. They w ill differ by just constant. I am going to call that the second 
variable, or the difference in height let's call it. That's x minus y. That is a very 
natural variable for the prob lem. The question is, what should  the other one be? 

Now you sort of stare at that for a while until it occurs to you that something is 
constant. What is constant in this prob lem? Well, the tank  is sitting there, that is 
constant. But what thing, which might be a variable, clearly must be a constant? It 
will be the total amount of water in the two tanks. These things vary, but the tota l 
amount of water stays the same because  it is a homogenous problem. 

No water is coming in  from the outside, and none is leaving the tanks through a little 
hole. Okay. What is the expression for the tota l amount of water in the tanks? x + 
2y. Therefore, that is a natural variable also. It is independent of this one. It is not a 
simple multiply of it. It is a rea lly d ifferent variable. 

This variable represents the total amount of liquid in the two tanks. This represents 
the pressure up to a constant factor. It is proportional to the pressure at the hole. 
Okay. Now what I am going to do is say this is my change of variab le. Now let's plug 
in and see what happens to  the system when I plug in these two variables. 

And how do I do that? Well, I want to substitute and get the new system. The new 
system, or rather the old system, but what makes it new is in terms of u and v. 
What will that be? Well, u' = x' + 2y'. 

But I know what x' + 2y' is because I can ca lculate it for this. What w ill  it be? x 
prime p lus 2y prime is negative 2x plus tw ice y prime, so it's p lus 2x, which is zero. 
And how about these two? 2y minus twice this, because I want this p lus twice that, 
so it 2y minus 2y, again, zero. 

The right-hand side becomes zero after I ca lculate x' + 2y. So that is zero. That 
would just, of course, clear. Now, that makes sense, of course. Since the total 
amount is constant, that says that u prime  is zero. Okay. What is v prime? v' = x' -
y'. What is that? 

Well, once again we have to calculate. x prime minus y prime is minus 2x minus x, 
which is minus 3x, and 2y minus negative y, which makes plus 3y. All right. What is 
the system? The system is u' = 0 and v' = -3(x - y). 

But (x - y) = v. In other words, these new two variab les decouple the system. And 
we got them, as scientists often do, by physical considerations. These variables go 
more deeply into what is going on in that system of two tanks than simp ly the two 
heights, which are too obvious as variables. 

All right. What is the solution? Well, the solution is, u equals a constant and v is 
equa l to? Well, the solution to this equation is a different arb itrary constant from that 
one. These are side-by-side equations that have nothing whatever to do w ith each 
other, remember? 

Times e^(-3t). Now, there are two options. Either one leaves the solution in terms of 
those new variables, saying they are more natural to the problem, but sometimes, of 
course, one wants the answer in terms of the old one. But, if you do that, then you 
have to solve that. In order to save a little time, since this is purely linear algebra, I 
am going to write --

Instead of taking two minutes to actua lly do the ca lculation in  front of you, I will just 
write down what the answer is --

-- in terms of u and x and y. In other words, this is a perfectly good way to leave the 
answer if you are a llowed to do it. 

But if somebody says they want the answer in terms of x and y, well, you have to 
give them what they are paying  for. In terms of x and y, you have first to solve 
those equations backwards for x and y in terms of u and v in which case you will get 
x = 1/3(u + 2v). Use the inverse matrix or just do elimination, whatever you usua lly 
like to do. 

And the other one w ill be 1/3(u - v). And then, if you substitute in, you w ill see what 
you will get is one-third of c1. Sorry. u is c1. 

c1 + 2c2 e^(-3t). And this is 1/3(c1 - c2 e^(-3t)). And so, the final solution is, in 
terms of the way we usua lly write out the answer, x will be what? 

Well, it w ill be one-third c1 times the eigenvector one, one plus one-third times c2 
times the eigenvector two, negative one times e^(-3t). That is the solution written 
out in terms of x and y either as a vector in the usua l way or separately in terms of x 
and y. 

But, notice, in order to do that you have to have these backwards equations. In 
other words, I need the equations in that form. I need the equations because they 
tell me what the new variab les are. But I a lso have to have the equations the other 
way in order to get the solution in terms of x and y,  finally. Okay. That was a ll an 
example. 

For the rest of the period, I would like to show you the genera l method of doing the 
same thing which does not depend upon being clever about the choice of the new 
variables. And then, at the very end of the period, I will apply the general method to 
this problem to see whether we get the same answer or not. What is the general 
method? Our prob lem is the decouple. Now, the first thing is you cannot a lways 
decoup le. 

To decouple the eigenvalues must all be real and non-defective. In other words, if 
they are repeated they must be complete. You must have enough independent 
eigenvectors. So they must be real and comp lete. If repeated, they must be 
complete. They must not be defective. 

As I told you at the time when we stud ied comp lete and incomplete, the most 
common case in which this occurs is when the matrix is symmetric. If the matrix  is 
real and symmetric then you can a lways decoup le the system. That is a very 
important theorem, particularly since many of the equilibrium problems normally 
lead to symmetric matrices and are solved by decoup ling. 

Okay. So what are we looking for? 

We are assuming this and we need it. In genera l, otherwise, you cannot decoup le if 
you have complex eigenvalues and you cannot decoup le if you have defective 
eigenvalues. 

Well, what are we looking  for? We are  looking for new variab les. (u, v) = (a1, a2; 
b1, b2)(x, y). And this matrix is ca lled D, the decoup ling matrix and is what we are 
looking  for. 

How do I choose those new variab les u and v when I don't have any physica l 
considerations to guide me as I did before? Now, the key is to look instead at what 
you are going to need. Remember, we are changing variab les. And, as I told you 
from the first days of the term, when you change variab les look at what you are 
going to need to substitute in to make the change of variables. 

Don't just start writing equations. What we are going to need to plug into that 
system and change it to the (u, v) coordinates  is not u and v in terms of x and y. 
What we need is x and y in terms of u and v to do the substitution. What we need is 
the inverse of this. So, in order to do the substitution, what we need is (x, y). 

Oops. Let's ca ll them prime. Let's ca ll these a1, b1, a2, b2 because these are going 
to be much more important to the problem than the other ones. Okay. I am going  to, 
I should call this matrix D inverse, that would be a sensib le thing to ca ll it. Since this 
is the important matrix, this is the one we are going to need to do the substitution, I 
am going to g ive it another letter instead. 

And the letter that comes after D is E. Now, E is an excellent choice because it is also 
the first letter of the word eigenvector. And the point  is the matrix E, which is going 
to work, is the matrix whose columns are the two eigenvectors. 

The columns are the two eigenvectors. Now, even if you d idn't know anything that 
would be practica lly the only reasonable choice anybody could make. What are we 
looking  for? To make a linear change of variables like this really means to pick new i 
and j vectors. 

You know,  from the first days of 18.02, what you want is a new coordinate system  in 
the p lane. And the coord inate system in the p lane is determined as soon as you tell 
what the new i is and what the new j is in the new system. To establish a linear 
change of coordinates amounts to picking two new vectors that are going to play the 
role of i and j instead of the old  i and the old j. 

Okay, so pick two vectors which somehow are important to this matrix. Well, there 
are only two, the eigenvectors. What else could they possibly be? Now, what is the 
relation? I say w ith this, what happens is I say that a lpha one corresponds, and 
alpha two, these are vectors in the xy-system. 

Well, if I change the coordinates to u and v, in the uv-system they w ill correspond to 
the vectors (1, 0). In other words,  the vector that we would norma lly ca ll i in the u, v 
system. And this one will correspond to the vector (0, 1). Now, if you don't believe 
that I w ill calculate it for you. 

The ca lculation is trivial. Look. What have we got? (x, y) equals (a1, a2; b1, b2). 
This is the column vector a lpha one. This is the column vector alpha two. Now, here 
is u and v. 

Suppose I make u and v equa l to one, zero, what happens to x and y? Your matrix 
multip ly. One, zero. So a1 + 0, b1 + 0. It corresponds to the column vector (a1, b1). 
And in the same way (0, 1) corresponds to (a2, b2). 

Just by matrix multiplication. And that shows that these correspond. In the uv-
system the two eigenvectors are now called i and j. Well, that looks very promising, 
but the program now is to do the substitution to substitute into the system x' = Ax 
and see if it is decoupled in the uv-coordinates. 

Now, I don't dare let you do this by yourself because you will run into trouble. 
Nothing is going to happen. You will just get a mess and w ill say I must be missing 
something. And that is because you are missing something. 

What you are missing, and this is a good occasion to tell you, is that, in genera l, 
three-quarters of the civilized world does not  introduce eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
the way you learn them in 18.03. They use a d ifferent definition that  is identical. I 
mean it is equivalent. The concept  is the same, but it looks a little d ifferent. 

Our definition is what? Well, what is an eigenva lue and eigenvector? The basic thing 
is this equation. 

This is a two-by-two matrix, right? This is a column vector with two entries. The 
product has to be a column vector with two entries, but both entries are supposed to 
be zero so I will write it this way. 

This way first defines what an eigenvalue  is. It is something that makes the 
determinant zero. And then it defines what an eigenvector is. It is, then, a solution 
to the system that you can get because the determinant is zero. Now, that  is not 
what most peop le do. What most peop le do  is the following. They write this equation 
differently by having something on both sides. 

Using the distributive law, what goes on the left side is A a lpha one. What is that? 
That  is a column vector w ith two entries. What goes on the right? Well, lambda one 
times the identity times a lpha one. Now, the identity matrix times anything just 
reproduces what was there. There is no difference between writing the identity times 
alpha one and just alpha one all by itself. 

So that is what I am going to do. This is the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvector 
that all the other people use. Most linear a lgebra books use this definition, or most 

books use a different approach and say, here is an eigenva lue and an eigenvector. 
And it requires them to define them in the opposite order. F irst what alpha one is 
and then what  lambda one is. 

See, I don't have any determinant now. So what is the definition? And they like it 
because it has a certain geometric flavor that this one lacks entirely. This is good  for 
solving d ifferential equations, which is why we are using it in 18.03, but this has a 
certain geometric content. This way thinks of A as a linear transformation of the 
plane, a shearing of the plane. You take the plane and do something to it. 

Or, you squish it like that. Or, you rotate it. That's okay, too. And the matrix defines 
a linear transformation to the p lane, every vector goes to another vector. The 
question it asks is,  is there a vector which is taken by this linear transformation and 
just left a lone or stretched, is kept in the same direction but stretched? Or, maybe 
its d irection is reversed and it is stretched or it shrunk. 

But,  in genera l, if there are real eigenva lues there w ill be such vectors that are just 
left in the same d irection but just stretched or shrunk. And what is the lambda? The 
lambda then is the amount by which they are stretched or shrunk, the factor. This 
way, first we have to find the vector, which is left essentially unchanged, and then 
the number here that goes w ith it is the stretching factor or the shrinking factor. 

But the end  result is the pa ir alpha one and lambda one, regard less of which order 
you  find them, satisfied the same equation. Now, a consequence of this definition we 
are going to need in the ca lculation that I am going to do in just a moment. Let me 
calculate that out. 

What I want to do is ca lculate the matrix A times E. I am going to need to calculate 
that. Now, what is that? Remember, E is the matrix whose columns are the 
eigenvectors. That is the matrix a lpha one, alpha two. Now, what  is this? Well, in 
both Friday's lecture and Monday's lecture, I used the fact that  if you do a 
multip lication like that it is the same thing as doing the multiplication A alpha one 
and putting it in the first column. 

And then A a lpha two is the column vector that goes in the second column. But what 
is this? This is lambda one a lpha one. And this is lambda two alpha two by this other 
definition of eigenva lue and eigenvector. And what is this? 

Can I write this in terms of matrices? Yes indeed I can. This is the matrix alpha one, 
alpha two times this matrix lambda one, lambda two, zero, zero. Check it out. 
Lambda one p lus zero,  lambda one times this thing p lus zero, the first entry is 
exactly that. 

And the same way the second column doing the same ca lculation is exactly this. 
What is that? That  is e times this matrix lambda one, zero, zero, lambda two. Okay. 
We are almost finished now. Now we can carry out our work. We are going to do the 
substitution. I start with a system. Remember where we are. 

I am starting w ith this system. I am going to make the substitution x equa l to this 
matrix E, whose columns are the eigenvectors. I am in introducing,  in other words, 
new variables u and v accord ing to that thing. u  is the column vector, (u, v). 

And x, as usual, is the column vector x and y. So I am going to p lug it  in. Okay. Let's 
plug it in. What do I get? I take the derivative. E is a constant matrix so that makes 
E u' = AE u. Now, at this point, you would be stuck, except I ca lculated for you A 
times E is E times that funny diagonal matrix w ith the lambdas. 

So this is E times that funny matrix of the lambdas, the eigenvalues, and still the u 
at the end of it. So where are we? E times u prime equa ls E times this thing. Well, 
multip ly both sides by E inverse and you can cancel them out. 

And so the end result is that after you have made the substitution in terms of the 
new variables u, what you get is u prime equals  lambda one, lambda two, zero, zero 
times u. Let's write that out in terms of a system. This  is u prime  is equal to, well, 
this is u, v here. It is lambda one times u plus zero times v. 

And the other one  is v prime equa ls zero times u plus  lambda two  times v. We are 
decoup led. In just one sentence you would say --

In other words, if you were reading a book that sort of assumed you knew what was 
going on, a ll it would say is as usual. That is to make you feel bad. Or, as is well-
known to make you feel even worse. Or, the system is decoup led by choosing as the 
new basis for the system the eigenvectors of the matrix and in terms of the resulting 
new coordinates, the decoupled system w ill be the following where the constants are 
the eigenva lues. 

And so the solution w ill be u = c1 e^( lambda1 t) and v = c2 e^( lambda2 t). Of 
course, if you want it back  in terms now of x and y, you w ill have to go back to here, 
to these equations and  then plug in for u and v what they are. And then you will get 
the answer in terms of x and y. Okay. 

We have just enough time to actua lly carry out this  little program. It takes a lot 
longer to derive than it does actually to do, so let's do it for this system that we were 
talking about before. Decouple the system, (x, y)' = (-2, 1; 1, -1). 

Okay. What do I do? Well, I first have to ca lculate the eigenva lues  in the 
eigenvectors, so the Ev's and Ev's. The characteristic equation is lambda squared. 
The trace is negative three, but you have to change the sign. The determinant is two 
minus two, so that  is zero. 

There  is no constant term here. It is zero. That is the characteristic equation. The 
roots are obviously lambda equals zero, lambda equa ls negative three. And what are 
the eigenvectors that go w ith that? W ith lambda equals zero goes the eigenvector, 
minus two. Well, I subtract zero here, so  the equation I have to solve  is minus 2 a1 
plus --

I am not going to write 2 a2, which is what you have been writing up until now. The 
reason is because I ran into troub le w ith the notation and I had to use, as the 
eigenvector, not a1, a2 but a1, b1. So it should be a b1 here, not the a2 that you are 
used to. The solution, therefore,  is alpha one equals one, one. And for lambda equa ls 
negative three,  the corresponding eigenvector this time w ill be --

Now I have to subtract negative three from here, so negative two minus negative 
three makes one. That is a1 + 2b1 = 0, a log ica l choice for the eigenvector here. The 

second eigenvector would be make b1 equa l to one, let's say, and then a1 w ill be 
negative two. Okay. 

Now what do we have to do? Now, what we want is the matrix E. The matrix E is the 
matrix of eigenvectors, E = (1, 1; -2, 1). The next thing we want is what the new 
variables u and v are. For that, we w ill need E inverse. How do you ca lculate the 
inverse of a two-by-two matrix? 

You switch the two diagonal elements, there I have switched them, and you  leave 
the other two where they are but change their sign. So it is two up here and 
negative one there. Maybe I should make this one purple and then that one purp le to 
indicate that I have sw itched them. I am not done yet. I have to divide by the 
determinant. 

What is the determinant? It is one minus negative two, which is three, so I have to 
divide by three. I multip ly everything here by one-third. Okay. And what is the 
decoup led system? The new variab les are u equals one-third. 

In other words, the new variables are g iven by D. It is (u, v) = (1, 2; -1, 1)*1/3*(x, 
y). That is the expression for u, v in terms of x and y. It's this matrix D, the 
decoup ling matrix which is the one that is used. 

And that g ives this system u = 1/3(x + 2y) on top. And what is the v entry? v = 
1/3(-x + y). Now, are those the same variables that I used before? 

Yes. This is my new and better you, the one I got by just blind ly follow ing the 
method instead of looking  for physica l things w ith physical meaning. It differs from 
the old one just by a constant factor. Now, that doesn't have any effect on the 
resulting equation because if the old one is u prime equa ls zero the new one is one-
third u prime equals zero. 

It is still the same equation, in other words. And how about this one? This one differs 
from the other one by the factor minus one-third. If I multiply that v through by 
minus one-third, I get this v. And, therefore, that too does not affect the second 
equation. I simp ly multip ly both sides by minus one-third. The new v still satisfies 
the equation -3v.
