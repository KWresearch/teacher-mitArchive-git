18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 24 

For the rest of the term, we are going to be studying not just one d ifferential 
equation at a time, but rather what are called systems of d ifferential equations. 
Those are like systems of linear equations. They have to be solved simultaneously, in 
other words, not just one at a time. So, how does a system look when you write it 
down? Well, since we are going to be ta lking about systems of ordinary d ifferential 
equations, there still w ill be only one independent variab le, but there will be several 
dependent variables. I am going to call, let's say two. The dependent variables are 
going to be, I will call them x and y, and then the first order system, something 
involving just first derivatives, will look  like this. 

On the left-hand side w ill be x', dx / dt, in other words. On the right-hand side will 
be the dependent variables and then also the independent variables. I will indicate 
that, I w ill separate it all from the others by putting a semicolon there. And the same 
way y', the derivative of y with respect to t, w ill be some other function of (x, y) and 
t. Let's write down exp licitly that x and y are dependent variab les. 

And what they depend upon is the independent variable t, time. A system like this  is 
going to be ca lled first order. And we are going to consider basica lly only first-order 
systems for a secret reason that I will exp lain at the end of the period. This is a first-
order system, meaning that the only kind of derivatives that are up here are first 
derivatives. So x' = dx / dt and so on. Now, there is still more terminology. Of 
course, practica lly all the equations after the term started, virtually all the equations 
we have been considering are linear equations, so it must be true that  linear systems 
are the best kind. And, boy, they certa inly are. 

When are we going to call a system linear? I think in the beg inning you should learn 
a little terminology before we launch in and actually try to start to solve these things. 
Well, the x and y, the dependent variables must occur linearly. In other words, it 
must look like this, ax + by. Now, the t can be a mess. And so I will throw  in an 
extra function of t there. And y' w ill be some other linear comb ination of x and y, 
plus some other messy function of t. But even the a, b, c, and d are allowed to be 
functions of t. They could be 1 / t^3 or sin(t) or something like that. So I have to 
distinguish those cases. The case where a, b, c, and d are constants, that I will ca ll --

Well, there are different things you can call  it. We will simp ly call  it a constant 
coefficient system. A system w ith coefficients would probably be better Eng lish. On 
the other hand, a, b, c, and d, this system will still be called linear if these are 
functions of t. Can also be functions of t. So it would be a perfectly good linear 
system to have x' = tx + sin(t) y + e^(-t^2). You would never see something like 
that but it is okay. What else do you need to know? Well, what would a homogenous 
system be? A homogenous system is one without these extra guys. That doesn't 
mean there is no t in it. 

There could be t in the a, b, c and d, but these terms with no x and y in them must 
not occur. So, a linear homogenous. And that  is the kind we are going to start 

studying first  in the same way when we stud ied higher order equations. We studied 
first homogenous. You had to know how to solve those first, and then you could 
learn how to solve the more genera l kind. So  linear homogenous means that r1 is 
zero and r2 is zero for all time. They are identically zero. They are not there. You 
don't see them. Have I left anything out? Yes, the initial cond itions. Since that is 
quite genera l, let's ta lk about what would initia l cond itions look like? 

Well, in a general way, the reason you have to have  initia l conditions is to get values 
for the arb itrary constants that appear in the solution. The question  is, how many 
arbitrary constants are going to appear in the solutions of these equations? Well, I 
will just give you the answer. Two. The number of arb itrary constants that appear is 
the tota l order of the system. For example, if this were a second derivative and this 
were a first derivative, I would expect three arbitrary constants in the system --

-- because the total,  the sum of two and one makes three. So you must have as 
many initia l conditions as you have arbitrary constants in the solution. And that, of 
course, expla ins when we studied second-order equations, we had to have two initia l 
cond itions. I had to specify the initia l starting point and the  initia l velocity. And the 
reason we had to have two conditions was because the general solution had two 
arbitrary constants  in it. 

The same thing happens here but the answer is it is more natura l, the cond itions 
here are more natural. I don't have to specify the velocity. Why not? Well, because 
an initia l condition, of course, would want me to say what the starting value of x is, 
some number, and it w ill a lso want to know what the starting value of y is at that 
same point. Well, there are my two cond itions. And since this is going  to have two 
arbitrary constants  in it, it is these initia l conditions that will satisfy, the arb itrary 
constants will have to be picked so as to satisfy those initia l conditions. In some 
sense, the g iving of initial conditions for a system is a more natural activity than 
giving the initial cond itions of a second order system. 

You don't have to be the least b it cleaver about it. Anybody would g ive these two 
numbers. Whereas, somebody faced with a second order system might scratch his 
head. And, in  fact, there are other kinds of cond itions. There are boundary cond itions 
you learned a little bit about instead of  initia l conditions for a second order equation. 
I cannot think of any more general terminology, so it sounds like we are going to 
actually have to get to work. 

Okay, let's get to work. I want to set up a system and solve it. And since one of the 
things in this course is supposed to be simple modeling, it should be a system that 
models something. In genera l, the kinds of models we are going to use when we 
study systems are the same ones we used in studying just first-order equations. 
Mixing, radioactive decay, temperature, the motion of temperature. Heat, heat 
conduction, in other words. D iffusion. I have g iven you a d iffusion problem for your 
first homework on this subject. What else did we do? That's a ll I can think of for the 
moment, but I am sure they will occur to me. When, out of those physical ideas, are 
we going to get a system? The answer is, whenever there are two of something that 
there was only one of before. 

For example, if I have mixing w ith two tanks where the fluid goes like that. Say you 
want to have a big tank and a little tank here and you want to put some stuff into 
the little tank so that it will get mixed in the big tank w ithout having to climb a b ig 
ladder and stop and drop the stuff in. That will require two tanks, the concentration 

of the substance in each tank, therefore, that w ill require a system of equations 
rather than just one. 

Or, to give something closer to home, closer to this backboard, anyway, suppose you 
have dah, dah, dah, don't groan, at least not audibly, something that looks like that. 
And next to it put an EMF there. That is just a first order. That just leads to a single 
first order equation. But suppose it is a two  loop circuit. Now I need a pair of 
equations. Each of these loops gives a first order d ifferential equation, but they have 
to be solved simultaneously to find the current or the charges on the condensers. 
And if I want a system of three equations, throw in another loop. Now, suppose I put 
in a coil instead. What is this going to  lead to? This  is going to give me a system of 
three equations of which this will be first order,  first order. 

And this w ill be second order because it has a coil. You are up to that, right? You've 
had coils, inductance? Good. So the whole thing is going to count as first-order,  first-
order, second-order. To find out how complicated it  is, you have to add up the 
orders. That is one and one, and two. This is rea lly fourth-order stuff that we are 
talking about here. We can expect it to be a little complicated. Well, now let's take a 
modest little problem. I am going to return to a problem we considered earlier in the 
problem of heat conduction. I had  forgotten whether it was on the problem set or I 
did it in class, but I am choosing it because it leads to something we will be ab le to 
solve. And because it illustrates how to add a little sophistication to something that 
was unsophisticated before. 

A pot of water. Externa l temperature Te(t). I am ta lking about the temperature of 
something. And what I am ta lking about the temperature of will be an egg that is 
cooking inside, but w ith a difference. This egg is not homogenous inside. Instead it 
has a white and it has a yolk in the midd le. In other words, it is a real egg and not a 
phony egg. That is a small pot, or it is an ostrich egg. [LAUGHTER] That is the yoke. 
The yolk is contained in a little membrane  inside. And there are little yucky things 
that hold it in position. And we are going to let the temperature of the yolk, if you 
can see in the back of the room, be T1. That is the temperature of the yolk. The 
temperature of the white, which we w ill assume  is uniform, is going to be T2. 

Oh, that's the water bath. The temperature of the white is T2, and then the 
temperature of the external water bath. In other words, the reason  for introducing 
two variab les instead of just the one variable for the overa ll temperature of the egg 
we had is because egg white is liquid pure protein, more or less, and the T1, the yolk 
has a lot of fat and cholesterol and other stuff like that which is supposed to be bad 
for you. 

It certa inly has different conducting. It is liquid, at the beginning at any rate, but it 
certainly has different constants of conductivity than the egg white would. And the 
cond ition of heat through the shell of the egg would be different from the conduction 
of heat through the membrane that keeps the yoke together. So it is quite 
reasonable to consider that the white and the yolk will be at d ifferent temperatures 
and w ill have different conductivity properties. 

I am going to use Newton's laws but with this further refinement. In other words, 
introducing two  temperatures. Whereas, before we only had one temperature. But 
let's use Newton's law. Let's see. The question is how does T1,  the temperature of 
the yolk, vary with time? Well, the yolk is getting all  its heat from the white. 

Therefore, Newton's law of conduction will be some constant of conductivity for the 
yolk times T2 - T1. 

The yolk does not know anything about the externa l temperature of the water bath. 
It is completely surrounded, snug and secure w ithin itself. But how about the 
temperature of the egg white? That gets heat and gives heat to two sources, from 
the externa l water and also  from the interna l yolk inside. So you have to take into 
account both of those. Its conduction of the heat through that membrane, we w ill 
use the same a, which is going to be a(T1 - T2). Remember the order in which you 
have to write these is governed by the yolk outside to the white. Therefore,  that has 
to come first when I write it  in order that a be a positive constant. But it is also 
getting heat from  the water bath. 

And, presumably, the conductivity through the shell is d ifferent from what it is 
through this membrane around the yolk. So I am going to call that by a d ifferent 
constant. This is the conductivity through the shell into the white. And that is going 
to be T, the externa l temperature minus the temperature of the egg white. Here I 
have a system of equations because I want to make two dependent variables by 
refining the orig inal problem. 

Now, you a lways have to write a system in standard form to solve  it. You will see 
that the  left-hand side w ill g ive the dependent variab les in a certain order. In this 
case, the temperature of the yolk and then the temperature of the white. The law is 
that in order not to make mistakes -- And it's a very frequent source of error so 
learn  from the beginning not to do this. You must write the variables on the right-
hand side in the same order left to right in which they occur top to bottom here. In 
other words, this is not a good way to leave that. This is the first attempt in writing 
this system, but the fina l version should like this. T1', I won't bother writing dT / dt, 
is equal to --

T1 must come first, so -aT1 + aT2. And the same law for the second one. It must 
come in the same order. Now,  the coefficient of T1, that is easy. That's a times T1. 
The coefficient of T2 is -a - b, so -(a + b)T2. But I am not done yet. There is still this 
external temperature I must put into the equation. Now, that is not a variable. This 
is some given function of t. And what the function of t is, of course, depends upon 
what the problem is. So that, for example, what might be some possib ilities, well, 
suppose the problem was I wanted to codd le the egg. 

I think there is a generation gap here. How many of you know what a coddled egg 
is? How many of you don't know? Well, I'm just saying my daughter didn't know. I 
mentioned it to her. I sa id I think I'm going to do a coddled egg tomorrow in class. 
And she said what is that? And so I said a cudd led egg? She said why would 
someone cuddle an egg? I sa id codd le. And she said, oh, you mean like a person, 
like what you do to somebody you like or don't like or I don't know. Whatever. I 
thought a while and said, yeah, more like that. [LAUGHTER] Anyway, for the 
enrichment of your cooking skills, to codd le an egg, it is considered to produce a 
better qua lity product than boiling an egg. That  is why people do it. 

You heat up the water to boiling, the egg should be at room temperature, and then 
you carefully lower the egg into the water. And you turn off the heat so the water 
bath cools exponentially while the egg inside is rising in temperature. And then you 
wait four minutes or six minutes or whatever and take it out. You have a perfect egg. 
So for coddling, spelled so, what will the external temperature be? 

Well, it starts out at time zero at 100 degrees centigrade because the water is 
supposed to be boiling. The reason you have it boiling is for ca libration so that you 
can know what temperature it is without having to use a thermometer, unless you're 
on P ike's Peak or some place. It starts out at 100 degrees. And after that, since the 
light is off, it cools exponentia l because that is another law. 

You only have to know what K is for your particular pot and you will be able to solve 
the codd led egg prob lem. In other words, you w ill then be able to solve these 
equations and know how the temperature rises. I am going to solve a different 
problem because I don't want to have to deal w ith this inhomogeneous term. Let's 
use, as a different prob lem, a person cooks an egg. Coddles the egg by the first 
process, decides the egg is done, let's say hardboiled, and then you are supposed to 
drop a hardboiled egg into cold water. Not just to cool it but a lso because I think it 
prevents that dark thing from  forming that looks sort of unattractive. Let's ice bath. 

The only reason for dropping the egg into an ice bath is so that you could have a 
homogenous equation to solve. And since this a first system we are going to solve, 
let's make life easy for ourselves. Now, all my work in preparing this example, and  it 
took considerab ly longer time than actua lly solving the prob lem, was in picking 
values for a and b which would make everything come out nice. It's harder than  it 
looks. The va lues that we are going to use, which make no physical sense 
whatsoever, but a = 2 and b = 3. These are ca lled nice numbers. What is the 
equation? What is the system? Can somebody read it off for me? It is T1' equals, 
what is it, -2T1 + 2T2. That's good. 

-2T1 + 2T2. T2 prime is, what is it? I think this is 2T1. And the other one is -(a + b), 
so minus 5. This is a system. Now, on Wednesday I will teach you a  fancy way of 
solving this. But, to be honest, the fancy way will take roughly about as long as the 
way I am going to do it now. The main reason for doing it is that it introduces new 
vocabulary which everyone wants you to have. And a lso, more important reasons, it 
gives more insight into the solution than this method. This method just produces the 
answer, but you want insight, also. And that is just as important. 

But for now, let's use a method which always works and which in 40 years, after you 
have forgotten a ll other fancy methods, will still be ava ilable to you because it is 
method you can figure out yourself. You don't have to remember anything. The 
method is to eliminate one of the dependent variables. It is just the way you solve 
systems of linear equations in genera l if you aren't doing something fancy with 
determinants and matrices. 

If you just eliminate variables. We are going to eliminate one of these variab les. 
Let's eliminate T2. You could a lso eliminate T1. The main thing is eliminate one of 
them so you w ill have just one left to work w ith. How do I eliminate T2? Beg your 
pardon? Is something wrong? If somebody thinks something is wrong  raise his hand. 
No? Why do I want to get rid of T1? Well, I can add them. But, on the left-hand side, 
I w ill have T1' + T2'. What good is that? [LAUGHTER] 

I think you w ill want to do it my way. [APPLAUSE] Solve for T2 in terms of T1. That 
is going to be (T1' + 2T1) / 2. Now, take that and substitute it into the second 
equation. Wherever you see a T2, put that  in, and what you will be left with is 
something just in T1. To be honest, I don't know any other good way of doing this. 
There  is a fancy method that I think is talked about in your book, which leads to 

extraneous solutions and so on, but you don't want to know about that. This w ill 
work for a simp le linear equation with constant coefficients, always. Substitute in. 
What do I do? Now, here I do not advise doing this menta lly. It is just too easy to 
make a mistake. 

Here, I will do it carefully, writing everything out just as you would. ((T1' + 2T1)/2)' 
= 2T1 - 5(T1' + 2T1)/2. I took that and substituted into this equation. Now, I don't 
like those two's. Let's get rid of them by multiplying. This w ill become 4. And now 
write this out. What is this when you look at it? This is an equation just in T1. It has 
constant coefficients. And what is its order? Its order is two because (T1')'. In other 
words, I can eliminate T2 okay, but the equation I am going to get is no longer a 
first-order. It becomes a second-order differential equation. And that's a basic law. 

Even if you have a system of more equations, three or four or whatever, the law is 
that after you do the elimination successfully and end up w ith a sing le equation, 
normally the order of that equation w ill be the sum of the orders of the things you 
started with. So two first-order equations will always produce a second-order 
equation in just one dependent variab le, three will produce a third order equation 
and so on. 

So you trade one complexity for another. You trade the comp lexity of having to dea l 
with two equations simultaneously instead of just one for the comp lexity of having to 
deal with a single higher order equation which is more trouble to solve. It is like all 
mathematica l prob lems. Unless you are very lucky,  if you push them down one way, 
they are really simple now, they just pop up some place else. 

You say, oh, I didn't save anything after a ll. That is the  law of conservation of 
mathematica l d ifficulty. [LAUGHTER] You saw that even w ith the Laplace transform. 
In the beginning  it looks great, you've got these tables, take the equation, horrible to 
solve. Take some transform, trivial to solve for capital Y. Now I have to find the 
inverse Lap lace transform. And suddenly all the work is there, partial fractions,  funny 
formulas and so on. 

It is very hard in mathematics to get away w ith something. It happens now and then 
and everybody cheers. Let's write this out now in the form  in which it looks like an 
equation we can actua lly solve. Just be careful. Now it is a ll right to use the method 
by which you collect terms. There is only one term involving T1 double prime. It's 
the one that comes from here. How about the terms in T1 prime? There is a 2. 

Here, there is minus 5 T1 prime. If I put it on the other side it makes p lus 5 T1 
prime p lus this two makes 7 T1 prime. And how many T1's are there? Well, none on 
the left-hand side. On the right-hand side I have 4 here minus 10. 4 minus 10 is 
negative 6. Negative 6 T1 put on this left-hand side the way we want to do makes 
plus 6 T1. There are no inhomogeneous terms, so that is equa l to zero. If I had 
gotten a negative number for one of these coefficients, I would instantly know if I 
had made a mistake. Why? Why must those numbers come out to be positive? 

It is because the system must be, the system must be, fill in with one word, stable. 
And why must this system be stab le? In other words, the long-term solutions must 
be zero, must all go to zero, whatever they are. Why is that? Well, because you are 
putting the egg into an ice bath. Or, because we know it was living but after being 
hardboiled it  is dead and, therefore, dead systems are stab le. 

That's not a good reason but it is, so to speak, the rea l one. It's clear anyway that all 
solutions must tend to zero physica lly. That's obvious. And, therefore, the differential 
equation must have the same property, and that means that its coefficients must be 
positive. All its coefficients must be positive. If this weren't there, I would get 
oscillating solutions, which wouldn't go to zero. That  is physical impossible for this 
egg. 

Now the rest is just solving. The characteristic equation, if you can remember way, 
way back in prehistoric times when we were solving these equations, is this. And 
what you want to do is factor it. This is where a ll the work was, getting those 
numbers so that this would  factor. So it's (r + 1)(r + g). And so the solutions are, 
the roots are r = -1. I am just making marks on the board, but you have done this 
often enough, you know what I am ta lking about. So the characteristic roots are 
those two numbers. And, therefore,  the solution is, I could write down immediately 
with its arbitrary constant as c1 e^(-t) + c2 e^(-6t). 

Now, I have got to get T2. Here the first worry is T2 is going to give me two more 
arbitrary constants. It better not. The system is only a llowed to have two arb itrary 
constants in its solution because that  is the  initial cond itions we are giving it. By the 
way, I forgot to give initial cond itions. Let's g ive initial cond itions. Let's say the initial 
temperature of the yolk, when it is put in the ice bath, is 40 degrees centigrade, 
Celsius. And T2, let's say the white ought to be a little hotter than the yolk is always 
cooler than the white for a soft boiled egg, I don't know, or a hardboiled egg if it 
hasn't been chilled  too long. Let's make this 45. Realistic numbers. 

Now, the thing not to do is to say, hey, I found T1. Okay, I w ill find T2 by the same 
procedure. I will go through the whole thing. I w ill eliminate T1 instead. Then I w ill 
end up with an equation T2 and I w ill solve that and get T2 equals blah, b lah, blah. 
That  is no good, A, because you are working too hard and, B, because you are going 
to get two more arb itrary constants unrelated to these two. 

And that is no good. Because the correct solution only has two constants in it. Not 
four. So that procedure is wrong. You must calculate T2 from the T1 that you found, 
and that is the equation which does it. That's the one we have to have. Where is the 
cha lk? Yes. Maybe I can have a little thing so I can just carry this around w ith me. 
That  is the relation between T2 and T1. Or, if you don't like it, either one of these 
equations w ill express T2 in terms of T1 for you. It doesn't matter. Whichever one 
you use, however you do it, that's the way you must ca lculate T2. So what  is it? T2 
is calculated from that pink box. 

It is 1/2 T1' + T1. Now, if I take the derivative of this, I get minus c1 times the 
exponentia l. The coefficient is minus c1, take ha lf of that, that is -1/2 c1 and add it 
to T1. -1/2 c1 + c1 = 1/2 c1. And here I take the derivative, it is minus 6 c2. Take 
half of that, minus 3 c2 and add this c2 to it, minus 3 p lus 1 makes minus 2. That is 
T2. And notice it uses the same arbitrary constants that T1 uses. 

So we end up with just two because we calculated T2 from  that formula or from the 
equation which is equivalent to it, not from scratch. We haven't put in the initia l 
cond itions yet, but that is easy to do. Everybody, when working w ith exponentia ls, of 
course, you a lways want the initial cond itions to be when T = 0 because that makes 
all the exponentials one and you don't have to worry about them. But this you know. 
If I put in the  initia l conditions, at time zero, T1 has the value 40. 

So 40 = c1 + c2. And the other equation will say that 45 = 1/2 c1 - 2 c2 Now we are 
supposed to solve these. Well, this is called solving simultaneous linear equations. 
We could use Kramer's rule,  inverse matrices, but why don't we just eliminate. Let 
me see. If I multip ly by, 45, so multiply by two, you get 90 = c1 - 4 c2. Then 
subtract this guy from that guy. So, 40 taken from 90 makes 50. 

And c1 taken from c1, because I multip lied by two, makes zero. And c2 taken from -
4 c2 - c2 = -5 c2, I guess. I seem to get c2 = -10. And if c2 is negative 10, then c1 
= 50. There are two ways of checking the answer. One is to p lug it into  the 
equations, and the other is to peak. Yes, that's right. [LAUGHTER] 

The final answer is, in other words, you put a 50 here, 25 there, negative 10 here, 
and positive 20 there. That gives the answer to the prob lem. It tells you, in other 
words, how the temperature of the yolk varies with time and how the temperature of 
the white varies w ith time. As I said, we are going to learn a slick way of doing this 
problem, or at least a very different way of doing the same problem next time, but 
let's put that on ice for the moment. And instead I would like to spend the rest of the 
period doing for first order systems the same thing that I did  for you the very first 
day of the term. 

Remember, I wa lked in assuming that you knew how to separate variab les the first 
day of the term, and I did not talk to you about how to solve fancier equations by 
fancier methods. I instead ta lked to you about the geometric significance, what the 
geometric meaning of a sing le first order equation was and how  that geometric 
meaning enab led you to solve it numerica lly. And we spent a little while working on 
such problems because nowadays with computers  it is really important that you get 
a feeling for what these things mean as opposed to just a lgorithms for solving them. 
As I say, most differentia l equations, especially systems, are likely to be solved by a 
computer anyway. 

You have to be the guid ing genius that interprets the answers and can see when 
mistakes are being made, stuff like that. The problem is, therefore, what is the 
meaning of this system? Well, you are not going to get anywhere interpreting it 
geometrically, unless you get rid of that t on the right-hand side. And the only way 
of getting rid of the t is to declare it  is not there. So I hereby declare that I will only 
consider, for the rest of the period, that is only ten minutes, systems in which no t 
appears exp licitly on the right-hand side. 

Because I don't know what to do if it does up here. We have a word  for these. 
Remember what the first order word was? A first order equation where there was no 
t explicitly on the right-hand side, we ca lled it, anybody remember? Just curious. 
Autonomous, right. This is an autonomous system. It is not a  linear system because 
these are messy functions. This could be xy or x squared minus 3y squared divided 
by sine of x plus y. It could be a mess. Definitely not linear. But autonomous means 
no t. t means the independent variable appears on the right-hand side. Of course, it 
is there. It is buried in the dx/dt and dy/dt. 

But it is not on the right-hand side. No t appears on the right-hand side. Because no 
t appears on the right-hand side, I can now draw a p icture of this. But, let's see, 
what does a solution look like? I never even talked about what a solution was, did I? 
Well, pretend that immediately after I talked about that, I ta lked about this. What is 
the solution? Well, the solution, maybe you took it for granted, is a pair of functions, 

(x(t), y(t)) if when you plug it in it satisfies the equation. And so what else is new? 
The solution is x = x(t), y = y(t). 

If I draw a p icture of that what would it look like? This is where your previous 
know ledge of physics above a ll 18.02, maybe 18.01 if you learned this in high 
school, what  is x = x(t) and y = y(t)? How do you draw a p icture of that? What does 
it represent? A curve. And what will be the title of the chapter of the calculus book in 
which that is d iscussed? Parametric equations. This  is a parameterized curve. 

So we know what the solution looks like. Our solution is a parameterized curve. And 
what does a parameterized curve look like? Well, it travels, and in a certain d irection. 
Okay. That's enough. Why do I have severa l of those curves? Well, because I have 
several solutions. In fact, given any initia l starting point, there is a solution that goes 
through it. I w ill put in possible starting points. And you can do this on the computer 
screen with a little program you will have, one of the visuals you'll have. It's being 
made right now. 

You put down starter point, put down a click, and then it just draws the curve 
passing through that point. D idn't we do this early in the term? Yes. But there is a 
difference now which I will exp lain. These are various possib le starting points at time 
zero for this solution, and then you see what happens to it afterwards. In  fact, 
through every point in the p lane will pass a solution curve, parameterized curve. 

Now, what is then the representation of this? Well, what is the meaning of x'(t) and 
y'(t)? I am not going to worry for the moment about the right-hand side. What does 
this mean by itself? If this is the curve, the parameterized motion, then this 
represents its velocity vector. It  is the velocity of the solution at time t. If I think of 
the solution as being a parameterized motion. All I have drawn here is the trace, the 
path of the motion. This hasn't indicated how  fast it was going. One solution might 
go whoosh and another one might go rah. That is a velocity, and that velocity 
changes from point to point. It changes d irection. Well, we know its direction at each 
point. That's tangent. 

What I cannot tell is the speed. From this p icture, I cannot tell what the speed was. 
Too bad. Now, what is then the meaning of the system? What the system does,  it 
prescribes at each point the velocity vector. If you tell me what the point (x, y) is in 
the p lane then these equations give you the velocity vector at that point. And, 
therefore, what I end up w ith,  the system is what you call in physics and what you 
call in 18.02 a velocity field. 

So at each point there is a certa in vector. The vector is a lways tangent to the 
solution curve through there, but I cannot predict from just this picture what its 
length w ill be because at some points, it might be going slow. The solution might be 
going slow ly. In other words, the plane is filled up with these guys. Stop me. Not 
enough here. So on and so on. We can say a system of first order equations, ODEs 
of first order equations, autonomous because there must be no t on the right-hand 
side, is equal to a velocity field. 

A field of velocity. The p lane covered w ith velocity vectors. And a solution is a 
parameterized curve with the right velocity everywhere. Now, there obviously must 
be a connection between that and the d irection fields we studied at the beginning of 
the term. And there is. It is a very important connection. It  is too important to ta lk 

about in minus one minute. When we need it, I will have to spend some time talking 
about it then.
