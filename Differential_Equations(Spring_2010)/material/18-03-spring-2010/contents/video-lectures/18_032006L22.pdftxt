18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 22 

Today we are going to do a last serious top ic on the Lap lace transform, the last topic 
for which I don't have to make frequent and profuse apolog ies. One of the things the 
Laplace transform does very well and one of the reasons why people like it, 
eng ineers like it, is that it hand les functions with jump d iscontinuities very nicely. 
Now, the OR  function w ith a jump discontinuity is-- Purp le. Is a  function called the 
unit step function. 

I w ill draw a graph of it. Even the graph  is controversial, but everyone  is agreed that 
it zero here and one there. What peop le are not agreed upon is its va lue at zero. And 
some people make it zero, some people make it one, and some equivocate like me. I 
will leave it undefined. It is u(t). It is ca lled the unit step. Because that is what it is. 
And let's say we w ill leave u(0) undefined. 

If that makes you unhappy, get over it. Of course, we don't always want the jump to 
be at zero. Sometimes we w ill want to jump in another place. If I want the function 
to jump, let's say at the point a instead of jumping at zero, I am going to start doing 
what everybody does. You put in the vertica l lines, even though I have no meaning, 
whatever, but  it makes the graph look more connected and a little easier to read. So 
that function I w ill call (u)a is the function which jumps at the point a. How shall I 
give its definition? 

Well, you can see it is just the translation by a of the unit step function. So that is 
the way to write it, u(t - a). Now I am not done. There is a unit box function, which 
we will draw  in genera l terms like this. It gets to a, then  it jumps up to one, fa lls 
down aga in at b and continues onto zero. This happens between a and b. And the 
value to which it arises is one. I will ca ll this the unit box. 

It is a  function of t, a very simple one but an important one. And what would be the 
formula for the unit box function? Well, in general, a lmost a ll of these functions, as 
you will see when you use jump discontinuity, the idea is to write them all cleverly 
using nothing but u(t). Because it is that will have the Laplace transformer. The way 
to write this  is (u)ab . And,  if you like, you can treat this as the definition of it. Let's 
make it a definition. Okay, three lines. Or, better yet, a colon and two lines. I am 
defining this to be, what would it be? 

Make the unit step at a step up at a, but then I would continue at one a ll the time. I 
should, therefore, step down at b. Now, the way you step down is just by taking the 
negative of the unit step function. I step down at b by subtracting (u)b (t). In other 
words, it  is u(t - a) - u(t - b). And now I have expressed it entirely in terms of the 
unit step function. That w ill be convenient when I want take the Laplace transform. 
What is so good about these things? Well, these functions, when you use them in 
multip lications, they transform other functions in a nice way. Not transform. That is 
not the right word. They operate on them. They turn them into other strange 
creatures, and it might be these strange creatures that you are interested in. 

Let me just draw you a picture. That w ill be good enough. Suppose we have some 
function like that, f(t), what would the function (u)ab, I w ill put in the variab le, t 
times f(t), what function would that be? I am just going to draw its graph. What 
would its graph be? Well, in between a and b this function u(ab) (t) = 1. All I am 
doing is multiplying  f(t) * 1. In short, I am not doing anything to it at all. Outside of 
that interva l, (u)ab has the value zero, so that 0 * f(t) = 0. And, therefore, outside 
of this  it is zero. The effect of multiplying an arb itrary function by this unit box 
function is, you w ipe away all of its graph except the part between a and b. 

Now, that is a very useful thing to be ab le to do. Well, that is enough of that. Now, 
let's get into the main topic. That  is just preliminary. I will be using these functions 
all during the period, but the real top ic is the following. Let's calculate the Laplace 
transform of the unit step function. Well, this is no very big deal. It is the Integra l 
from 0 to infinity of [e^(-st) y(t)] dt. But, look, when t > 0, this has the value one. 
So it is the same of the Laplace transform of one. In other words,  it is 1 / s for 
positive values of s. 

Or, to make it very clear, the Lap lace transform of one is exactly the same thing. As 
you see,  the Laplace transform really is not interested in what happens when t < 0 
because that is not part of the domain of integration, the interval of integration. That 
is fine. They both have Lap lace transform of 1 / s. What  is the b ig deal? The b ig deal 
is, what is the inverse Laplace transform L^(-1)  (1 / s)? Will the real function please 
stand up? Which of these two should  I p ick? Up to now in the course we have been 
picking one just because I never made a fuss over it and one was good enough. 

For today one is no longer going to be good enough. And we have to first investigate 
the thing in a slightly more theoretical way because this prob lem, I have illustrated it 
on the L^(-1) 1/x, but it occurs for any inverse Laplace transform. Suppose I have, 
in other words, that a  function  f of t has as its Laplace transform cap ita l F(s)? And 
now, I ask what the inverse L^(-1) F(s) is. Well, of course you want to write f(t). But 
the same thing happens. I w ill draw you a p icture. Suppose, in other words, that 
here is our function f of t. Well, one answer certainly is f of t. That is okay. That is 
the answer we have been using up until now. 

But, you see, I can complete this function in many other ways. Suppose I haven't 
told you what it was for s less than zero. Any of these possibilities a ll will produce the 
same Laplace transform. In fact, I can even make  it this. That is okay. Each of these, 
f(t) with any one of these tails, a ll have the same Laplace transform. Because the 
Laplace transform, remember the definition, Integral from 0 to infinity of [e^(-st) 
f(t) dt] because the Laplace transform does not care what the function was doing  for 
negative values of t. Now, if we have to have a unique answer --

And most of the time you don't because, in general, the Lap lace transform is only 
used for problems for future time. That is the way the engineers and physicists and 
other peop le who use  it habitua lly think of it. If your problem  is starting now and 
going on into the future and you don't have to know anything about the past, that is 
a Laplace transform problem. If you also have to know about the past, then it is a 
Fourier transform prob lem. 

That  is beyond the scope of this course, you will never hear that word again, but that 
is the difference. We are starting at time zero and going forward. All right. It does 
not care what f of t was doing for negative va lues of t. And that g ives us a problem 
when we try to make the Laplace transform unique. Now, how will I make it unique? 

Well, there is a simple way of doing  it. Let's agree that wherever it makes a 
difference, and most of the time it doesn't, but today it w ill, whenever it makes a 
difference we w ill declare, we w ill by brute force make our function zero  for negative 
values of t. That makes it unique. I am going to say that to make it unique, now, 
how do I make f(t) = 0 for negative values of t? The answer is multiply it by the unit 
step function. 

That  leaves it what it was. It multip lies  it by one for positive values but multiplies it 
by zero for negative values. The answer is going to be u(t) f(t). That will be the 
function that w ill  look just that way that I drew, but I will draw  it once more. It is the 
function that  looks  like this. And when I do this, it makes the  inverse Laplace 
transform unique. Out of a ll the possible ta ils I might have put on f(t), it picks the 
least interesting one, the ta il zero. 

That  is a start. But what we have to do now is -- What I want is a formula. What we 
are going to need is, as you see right even in the beg inning, if for example, if I want 
to ca lculate the Lap lace transform of this, what I would like to have is a nice Laplace 
transform for the translate. If you translate a function, how does that effect this 
Laplace transform? In other words,  the formula  I am looking for is --

I want to express the L(f(t - a)). In other words, the function translated, let's say a 
is positive, so I translate it to the right a long  the t axis by the distance a. I want a 
formula for this in terms of the Laplace transform of the function I started w ith. Now, 
my first task is to convince you that, though this would be very useful and 
interesting, there cannot possibly be such a formula. There is no such  formula. 

Why not? Well, I think I w ill expla in it over there since there is a little p iece of board 
I d id not use. Waste not want not. Why can't there be such a  formula? What is it we 
are looking for? Let's take a nice average function f(t). It has a Laplace transform. 
And now I am going to translate it. Let's say this is the point negative a. And so the 
corresponding point positive a w ill be around here. I am going to translate it to the 
right by a. What is  it going to look like? Well, then it is going to start here and is 
going to look like this dashy thing. That is f(t - a). That is not too bad a p icture. It 
will do. I just took that curve and shoved it to  the right by a. 

Now, why  is it impossib le to express the Lap lace transform of the dashed  line in 
terms of the Laplace transform of the solid line? The answer is this p iece. I w ill write 
it this way. The trouble is, this p iece is not used  for the Laplace transform of f(t). 
Why isn't it used? Well, because it occurs to the left of the vertical axis. It occurs for 
negative values of t. And the L(f(t)) simp ly does not care what f(t) was doing to the 
left of that line, for negative va lues of t. It does not enter into the integral. 

It was not used when I ca lculated this piece of the curve. It was not used when I 
calculated the L(f(t)). On the other hand, it is going to be needed. It occurs here, 
after I shift it to the right. It  is going to be needed for the L(f(t - a)), because I w ill 
have to start the  integration here, and I will have to know what that is. 

In other words, when I took the Laplace transform, I automatically lost a ll 
information about the function for negative va lues of t. If I am later going to want 
some of that information for calculating this, I won't have it and, therefore, there 
cannot be a  formula expressing one in terms of the other. Now, of course, that 
cannot be the answer, otherwise I would not have raised your expectations merely to 
dash them. I don't want to do that, of course. There is a  formula, of course. It is 

just, I want to emphasize that you must write it my way because, if you write it any 
other way, you are going to get into the deepest troub le. The formula is-- the good 
formula, the right formula --

-- accepts the given. It says look, we have lost that p ink part of it. Therefore, I can 
never recover that. Therefore, I won't ask for it. The translation  formula I will ask for 
is not one for the L(f(t - a)), but rather for the Laplace transform of this thing where 
I have wiped away that pink part from the translated function. In other words,  the 
function I am talking about now is the formula for, I w ill put it over here to show you 
the function what we are ta lking about. It is the function f of, well, in terms of the 
pink function it is, I will have to reproduce some of that picture. There is f(t).  f(t - a), 
then, looked like this. 

And so the function I am looking  for is, this is the thing translated, but when I get 
down to the corresponding,  this is the point that corresponds to that one, I w ipe it 
away and just go with zero after that. So this is u(t - a) f(t - a). What is this Laplace 
transform? Now that does have a simp le answer. The answer is it is e^(-as), a funny 
exponentia l, times the Lap lace transform of the orig ina l function. Now, this formula 
occurs in two  forms. This one is not too bad looking. 

The troub le is, when you want to solve differential equations you are going to be 
extremely puzzled because the function that you will have to take to do the 
calculation on w ill not be g iven to you in the form f(t - a). It will look sin(t) or t^2 or 
some polynomial in t. It w ill not be written as t - a. What do you do? If your function 
does not  look like that but instead, in terms of symbols looks like this, you can still 
use the formula. 

Just a trivia l change of variable means that you can write it instead. Now, this is one 
place, there is no way of writing the answer in terms of capital F(s). This is one of 
those cases where this notation  is just no good anymore. I am going to have to write 
it using the L notation. The Lap lace transform of f(t + a). Basica lly, this  is the same 
formula as that one. But I w ill have to stand on my head for one minute to try to 
convince you of it. I won't do that now. I would like you just to take a look at the 
formula. You should know what  it is ca lled. There are a certa in number of idiots who 
call this the exponentia l shift formula because on the right side you multiply by an 
exponentia l, and that corresponds to shifting the function. 

Unfortunately, we have preempted that. We are not going to call it this. I will call it 
what your book calls it. The d ifficulty is there  is no universa l designation  for this 
formula, important as it is. However, your book calls this t-axis translation formula. 
Translation because I am translating on the t-axis. And that is what I do to the 
function, essentially. And this tells me what its new Laplace transform is. 

The other formula, remember it? The exponential shift formula, the shift or the 
translation occurs on the s-axis. In other words, the formula sa id that F(s - a), you 
do the translation in s variable corresponded to multip lying this by e^(at). In other 
words, the formulas are sort of dua l to each other. This guy translates on the left 
side and multiplies by the exponentia l on the right. The formula that you know 
translates on the right and multiplies by the exponential on the left. What are we 
going to calculate? I am trying to calculate, so I am trying to prove this first formula. 
The second one w ill be an easy consequence. I am trying to calculate the Laplace 
transform of that thing. What is it? 

Well, it is the Integra l from 0 to infinity of [e^(-st) u(t - a) f(t - a) dt]. That is the 
formula for it. But I am trying to express it in terms of the Laplace transform of f 
itself. Now, it  is trying to be the L(f). The prob lem is that here, a t - a occurs, which I 
don't like. 

I would like that to be just a t. Now, in order not to confuse you, and this is what 
confused everybody, I w ill set t1 = t - a. I will change the variab le. This  is called 
chang ing the variable in a definite integra l. How do you change the variable in a 
definite integra l? You do it. Well, let's leave the  limits for the moment. e^(-s) times -
- Now, t, remember you can change the variab le forwards, direct substitution, but 
now I have to use the inverse substitution. It's trivia l, but t = t1 + a. To change this 
I must substitute backwards and make that t1 + a. How about the rest of it? Well, 
this becomes u(t1). This is f(t1). I have to change the dt, too, but that's no problem. 
dt1 = dt because a is a constant. 

That  is dt1. And the last step is to put in the limits. Now, when t = 0, t1 = -a. So this 
has to be negative a when t is infinity. Infinity minus a is still infinity, so that is still 
infinity. In other words, this changes to that. These two things, whatever they are, 
they have the same value. All I have done is changed the variable. Make it change a 
variable. But now, of course, I want to make this look better. How am I going to do 
that? Well, first multiply out the exponential and then you get a factor e^(-s t1). 
That  is good. That goes with this guy. Now I get a factor e^(-sa) from the 
exponentia l law. But that does not have anything to do with the integral. It is a 
constant as far as the integral is concerned because it doesn't involve t1. And, 
therefore, I can pull it outside of the integral sign. 

And write that e^(-sa). Let's write it the other way. Times the integra l of what? Well, 
e^(-st1). Now, u(t1) f(t1) dt1. Still integrated from -a --> infinity. And now the final 
step. This u(t1) is zero for negative values of t. And, therefore,  it is equal to one for 
positive values of t. It is equa l to zero for negative values of t, which means I can 
forget about the part of the  integral that goes from -a --> 0. I better rewrite this. 
Okay, leave that. 

In other words, this is equal to e^(-as) times the integra l from zero to infinity of 
e^(-s) -- Let me do the shifty part now. And this is since u(t1) = 0 for t1 < 0. That is 
why I can rep lace this w ith zero. Because from negative a to zero, nothing is 
happening. The integrand is zero. And why can I get rid of it after that? Well, 
because it is one after that. And what is this thing? This is the Laplace transform. No, 
it is not the Lap lace transform they said. Because you had t1 there, not t. It is the 
Laplace transform because this is a dummy variable. 

The t1 is integrated out. It is a dummy variable. It doesn't matter what you ca ll it. It 
is still the Lap lace transform if I make that wiggly t or t* or tau or u. I can ca ll it 
anything I want and it is still the L(f(t)). What is the answer? That is e^(-as) L(f). 
That  is what I promised you in that formula. Now, how about the other formula? 
Well, let's look at that quickly. That is, as I say,  just sleight of hand. But since that is 
the formula you will be using at least ha lf the time you better learn it. This little 
sleight of hand is a lso reproduced in one page of notes that I give you, but maybe 
you will find it easy to understand  if I ta lk it out loud. 

The problem now is for the second formula. I am going to have to recopy out the 
first one in order to make the argument in a form in which you w ill understand it, I 
hope. This goes to e^(-as) F(s), except I am now going to write that not in F(s); 

since I will not be able to write the second formula using F of s, I am not going to 
write the first formula that way either. I will write it as the L(f(t)). 

Now, formally if somebody says, okay, how do I ca lculate the Laplace transform of 
this thing? I say put down this. Well, that has no t in it. It doesn't have the f  in it 
either. Then write this. What formula did I do? I looked at that and changed t - a --> 
t. Now, how did I change t - a? The way to say it is I changed t. Because the t is 
always there. t --> t + a. You get this by replace t by t plus a to get the right-hand 
side. 

I replace this t by t p lus a, and that turns this into f(t). And that is the f(t) that went 
in there. That is the universal rule for doing it. Now I am going to use that same rule 
for transforming u(t - a) f(t). See, the problem is now I have a  function like t^2 or 
sin(t), which is not written in terms of t minus a. And I don't know what to do w ith it. 
The answer is, by brute force, write it in terms of t - a. What is brute force? Brute 
force is the follow ing. I am going to put a t - a there if it kills me. t - a + a. 

No harm in that, is there? Now there is a t minus a there, just the way there was up 
there. And now what is the rule? I am just going to  follow my nose. What's sauce for 
the goose is sauce for the gander. M inus as, Lap lace transform of f of, now what am 
I going to write here? Wherever I see a t, I am going to change it from t p lus a. Here 
I see a t. I w ill change that to t + a. What do I have? t + a - a + a, well, if you can 
keep count, what does that make? It makes t + a in the end. 

The peace that passeth understanding. Let's do some examples and suddenly you 
will breathe a sigh of relief that this a ll is doable anyway. Let's calculate something. I 
hope I am not covering up any crucia l, yes I am. I am covering up the u of t's, but 
you know that by now. Let's see. What should we ca lculate first? What I just covered 
up. Let's calculate the L((u)ab (t)). What is that going to be? Well, first of all, write 
out what it is in terms of the unit step function. 

Remember that formula? There. Now you see it. Now you don't. Its Lap lace 
transform is going to be what? Well, the L(t - a), that is a special case here where 
this function is one. Well, that one. Either one. It makes no difference. It  is simply 
going to be the Laplace transform of what f(t) would have been, which is -- See, the 
L(u(t)) is what? That's one over s, right? Because this is the function one, and we 
don't care the fact that it is zero or negative values of t. That is my f(s). And so I 
multip ly it by e^(-as) 1 / s. I am using this formula, e to the minus as times the 
Laplace transform of the unit step function, which is 1 / s. How about the 
translation? 

That was taken care of by the exponential factor. And it's minus because this is 
minus. The same thing with the b. This is the Laplace transform of the unit box 
function. It looks a little hairy. You w ill learn to work with it, don't worry about it. 
How about the Lap lace transform of -- Okay. Let's use the other formula. What 
would be the L(u(t - 1) t^2), for example? See,  if I gave this to you and you only 
had the first formula, you would say, hey, but there is no  t minus one in there. There 
is only t^2. What am I supposed to do? Well, some of you might dig way back into 
high school and say every polynomial can be written in powers of t - 1, that is what I 
will do. 

That would give the right answer. But in case you had  forgotten how to do that, you 
don't have to know because you could use the other formula instead, which, by the 

way, is the way you do it. What are we going to do? It goes into e^(-s). The a  is one 
in this case, plus one. e to the minus s times the Laplace transform of what function? 
Change t --> t + 1. The L((t + 1)^2). What is that? That is e^(-s) L(t^2 + 2t + 1). 
What's that? Well, by the formulas which I am not bothering to write on the board 
anymore because you know  them, it is e^(-s) times --

L(t^2) = 2! / s^3. Remember you a lways have to ra ise the exponent by one. This is 
two factorial, but that is the same as two. Plus two. This two comes from there. L(t) 
= 1 / s^2. And,  finally, the L(1) = 1 / 2. You mean all that mess from this simple-
looking  function? This function is not so simple. What is its graph? What is it we are 
calculating the Laplace transform of? Well, it is the function t^2. But multiplying it by 
that factor u(t - 1) means that the only part of it I am using is this part, because u(t 
- 1) = 1 when t is bigger than one. 

But when t is  less than one it is zero. That function doesn't look all that simple to 
me. And that is why its Lap lace transform has three terms in it w ith this exponential 
factor. Well, it is a d iscontinuous function. And it gets d iscontinuous at a very 
peculiar spot. You have to expect that. Where in this does it tell you it becomes 
discontinuous at one? It is because this is e^(-1*s). 

This tells you where the discontinuity occurs. The rest of it is just stuff you have to 
take because it  is the function t^2. It's what  it is. All right. I think most of you are 
going to encounter the worst troubles when you try to ca lculate inverse Lap lace 
transforms, so let me try to exp lain how that is done. I w ill g ive you a simp le 
example first. And  then I will try to give you a slightly more comp licated one. But 
even the simp le one won't make your head ache. 

We are going to calculate the L(1 + e^(-pi s) / (s^2 + 1)). All right. Now, the first 
thing you must do is as soon as you see exponentia l factors in there like that you 
know that these functions, the answer is going to be a discontinuous function. And 
you have got to separate out the d ifferent pieces of it that go w ith the d ifferent 
exponentia ls. Because the way the formula works, it has to be used differently for 
each va lue of a. 

Now, in this case, there is only one va lue of a that occurs. Negative p i. But it does 
mean that we are going to have to begin by separating out the thing into 1 / (s^2 + 
1) and this other factor e^(-p i s) / (s^2 + 1). Now all I have to do is take the 
inverse Lap lace transform of each p iece. The L^(-1) 1 / (s^2 + 1) is --

Well, up to now we have been saying its sin(t), right? If you say it is sine t you are 
going to get into trouble. How come? We d idn't get into trouble before. Yes, but that 
was because there were no exponentials in the expression. When there are 
exponentia ls you have to be more careful. Make the inverse transform unique. Make 
it not sine t, but u(t) sin(t). You will see why in just a moment. If this weren't there 
then sine t would be perfectly okay. W ith that factor there, you have got to put in 
the u(t), otherw ise you won't be ab le to get the formula to work right. In other 
words, I must use this particular one that I p icked out to make  it unique at the 
beginning of the period. Otherw ise,  it just won't work. 

Now, I know that is fine. But now what is L^(-1) e^(-pi)? In other words, it is the 
same function, except I am now multiplying it by e^(-pi s). Well, now I will use that 
formula. My f(s) = 1 / (s^2 + 1), and that corresponds it to sin(t). If I multip ly it by 
e^(-pi s), just copy it down. 

It now corresponds,  the inverse Laplace transform, to what the left side says it does. 
u(t - pi) times, in other words, this corresponds to that. Then if I multip ly it by e^(-
pi s), it corresponds to change t --> t - p i. What is the answer? The answer is you 
sum these two p ieces. The first piece is u(t) sin(t). The second piece is u(t) - pi sin(t 
- pi). 

Now, if you leave the answer in that form it is technically correct, but you are going 
to lose a lot of credit. You have to transform  it to make it  look good. You have to 
make it intellig ible. You are not allowed to leave it  in that form. What could we do to 
it? Well, you see, this part of it is interesting whenever t is positive. This part of it is 
only interesting when t is greater than or equal to p i because this is zero. Before that 
this is zero. What you have to do is make cases. Let's ca ll the answer f(t). The 
function has to be presented in what is ca lled the cases format. That is what it is 
called when you type in tech, which I think a certain number of you can do anyway. 

You have to make cases. The first case is what happened between zero and p i? Well, 
between zero and p i, only this term is operational. The other one is zero because of 
that factor. Therefore, between zero and pi the function looks like, now, I don't have 
to put in the u(t) because that is equal to one. It is equal to sin(t) between zero and 
pi. What is it equa l to bigger than pi? Well, the first factor, the first term still obtains, 
so I have to include that. But now I have to add the second one. Well, what is the 
second term? I don't include the t - pi, u(t - pi) anymore because that is now one. 
That has the value one. It is sin(t - pi). But what is sine of t minus p i? 

You take the sine curve and you translate it to the right by pi. So what happens to 
it? It turns  into this curve. In other words, it turns into the curve, what curve is that? 
Minus sine t. The other factor, this factor is one and this becomes negative -sin(t). 
And so the final answer is f(t) = sin(t) between zero and p i and zero for t greater 
than or equal to pi. 

That  is the right form of the answer.
