18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 26 

I just want to remind you of the ma in facts. The first thing that you have to do is, of 
course, we are going to have to be doing it several times today. That is the system 
we are trying to solve. And the first thing you have to do is find a characteristic 
equation which is genera l form, although this is not the form you should use for two-
by-two,  is A - lambda I = 0. And its roots are the eigenvalues. 

And then w ith each eigenvalue you then have to ca lculate its eigenvector, which you 
do by solving the system (A - lambda1 I) a lpha = 0 because the solution  is the 
eigenvector alpha 1. And then the fina l solution that you make out of the two of 
them looks like alpha1 e^(lambda1 t). Of course you do that for each eigenva lue. 
You get the associated eigenvector. 

And then the general solution is made up out of a linear combination of these 
individual guys w ith constant coefficients. The lecture today is devoted to the two 
cases where things do not go as smoothly as they seem to in the homework 
problems you have been doing up until now. The first one w ill take probably most of 
the period. It deals with what happens when an eigenvalue gets repeated. But I 
think since the situation is a little more comp licated than it  is where the case of a 
characteristic root gets repeated in the case of a second-order equation as we saw it, 
you know what to do in that case, here there are d ifferent possibilities. And I thought 
the best thing to do would be to illustrate them on an examp le. So here is a problem. 

It came out of a mild nightmare, but I won't bore you with the details. Anyway, we 
have this circular fish tank. It is a very modern  fish tank. It is divided into three 
compartments because one holds Siamese fighting fish and one goldfish, and one--
They should not eat each other. And it is going to be a simple temperature problem. 
The three actual compartments have to be kept at different temperatures because 
one  is for tropical fish and one is for arctic fish and one  is for everyday garden 
variety fish. But the guy forgets to turn on the heater so  the temperatures start out 
what they are supposed  to be, trop ical, icy, and normal. But as the day wears on, of 
course, the three compartments trade their heat and sort of tend to all end up at the 
same temperature. 

So we are going to let (x)i equa l the temperature in tank i. Now, these are separated 
from each other by glass things. Everything is identical, each has the same volume, 
and the same glass partition separates them out and no heat can escape. This is 
very well- insulated w ith very doub le-thick Thermopane glass or something like that. 
You can see in, but heat cannot get out very well. Heat essentially is conducted  from 
one of these cells to the other. And let's assume that the water in each tank is kept 
stirred up because the fish are swimming around in it. That should be a pretty decent 
way of stirring a fish tank. The question is how do each of these, as a  function of 
time, and  I want to know how they behave over time, so find these functions. 

Well, we are going to find them in solutions to differential equations. And the 
differentia l equations are not hard to set up. They are very much like the diffusion 

equation you had for homework or the equations we stud ied in the beginning of the 
term. Let's do one carefully because the others go exactly the same way. What 
determines the flow, the change in temperature? Well, it is the conductivity across 
the barriers. But there are two barriers because heat can  flow  into this first cell, both 
from this guy and it can flow across this glass pane from the other cell. We have to 
take account of both of those possib ilities. It is like  in your homework. The little 
diffusion cell that was in the midd le could get contributions from both sides, 
whereas, the two guys on the end could only get contribution from one. 

But here, nobody is on the end. It is circular tab le. Everyone is dying equa lly. 
Everybody can get input from the other two cells. x1' is some constant of 
conductivity times the temperature d ifference between tank three and tank one. And 
then there is another term which comes from tank two. So a times tank two minus 
the temperature difference, tank two minus tank one. Let's write this out. Remember 
there will be other equations, too. But instead of doing this, let's do a more careful 
job w ith this first equation. When I write it out, remember, the important thing is 
you are going to have x1, x2, x3 down the left, so they have to occur in the same 
order on the right in order to use these standard eigenvalue techniques. 

The coefficient of x1 is going to be minus a x1 and then another minus a x1. In other 
words, it  is going to be minus 2 ax1. And then the x2 term will be p lus a x2. And the 
x3 term will be p lus a x3. Well, you can see now that is the equation for x1 prime  in 
terms of the other variables. But there is symmetry. There is no difference between 
this tank, that tank, and that tank as far as the differentia l equations are concerned. 
And, therefore, I can get the equations for the other two tanks by just chang ing 1 to 
2, just switching the subscripts. When I finally do it a ll,  the equations are going to 
be, I will write them first out as a system. 

Let's take a = 1 because I am going  to want to solve them numerica lly, and I want 
you to be able to concentrate on what  is important, what  is new now and not fuss 
because I don't want to have an extra a floating around everywhere just contributing 
nothing but a mild confusion to the proceedings. So x1 prime, I am going to take a 
equa l 1 and simply write it -2 x1 + x2 + x3. And so now what would the equation for 
x2' be? 

Well, here x2 plays the role that x1 p layed before. And the only way to tell that x1 
was the ma in guy here was it occurred with a coefficient negative 2, whereas, the 
other guys occurred with coefficient 1. That must be what happens here, too. Since 
x2' is our ma in man, this  is minus x2 and this must be x1 here plus x3. And finally 
the last one is no different, x3 prime is x1 plus x2. 

And now it is the x3 that should get negative 2 for the coefficient. There  is a 
perfectly reasonable-looking set of equations. Just how reasonab le they are depends 
upon what their characteristic polynomia l turns out to be. And a ll the work in these 
problems  is trying to find nice models where you won't have to use Matlab to 
calculate the roots, the eigenva lues, the roots of the characteristic polynomial. 

So we have to now find the characteristic polynomial. The matrix that we are ta lking 
about is the matrix, well, let's right away write|A - lambda I|. I cannot use the trace 
and determinant form for this equation because  it is not a two-by-two matrix. It is a 
three-by-three matrix. I have to use the orig ina l form for the characteristic equation. 
But what is this going to be? Well, what is A? A is minus 2. I am going to leave a 
little space here. 1, 1, 1 minus 2, 1. And fina lly 1, 1, negative 2. I subtract lambda 

from the main diagona l, minus -2 - lambda, minus 2 minus lambda, minus 2 minus 
lambda. And now that equals zero is the characteristic equation. 

The term with the most lambdas in  it is the ma in diagonal. That is a lways true, 
notice. Now, each of these I would be happier writing lambda plus 2, so there would 
be a negative sign, negative sign, negative sign. The product of three negative signs 
is still a negative sign because three is an odd number. So it  is minus the principle 
term. The product of these three  is -(lambda + 2)^3. Now,  the rest of the terms are 
going to be easy. There is another term 1 times 1 times 1, another term 1 times 1 
times 1. So to that I add 2, 1 and 1 for those two other terms. And now  I have the 
three going in this d irection, but each one of them has to be prefaced w ith a minus 
sign. What does each one of them come to? 

Well, this is minus 2 minus lambda when I multiply those three numbers together. 
And so are the other guys. This is 1 times 1 times minus 2 minus lambda, the same 
thing. There are three of them. M inus because they are going this way, minus 3 
because there are three of them, and what each one of them  is is negative 2 
negative  lambda. That is equal to zero, and that is the characteristic equation. 

Now, it doesn't look very promising. On the other hand, I have selected it for the 
lecture. Simple psychology should tell you that it is going to come out okay. What I 
am going to do is expand this. First imagine changing the sign. I hate to have a 
minus sign  in front of a lambda^3, so let's make this plus and we will make this 
minus and we will make this plus. I w ill just change all the signs, which  is okay since 
it is an equation equals zero. That doesn't change its roots any. 

And now we are going to expand it out. What is this? ( lambda + 2)^3. Lambda 
cubed p lus, and don't get confused because it is this 2 that w ill kill you when you use 
the b inomia l theorem. If there is 1 here everybody knows what to do. If there is an A 
there everybody knows what to do. It is when that is a number not 1 that everybody 
makes mistakes, including me. The binomial coefficients are 1, 3, 3, 1 because  it is a 
cubed, I am expanding. 

So it is lambda^3 + 3 lambda^2 * 2 + 3 *  lambda * 2^2 + 2^3. And now we have 
the other term. All that is plus because I changed its sign. The next thing is negative 
2. 

And then the last thing is +3*(-2 - lambda). Let's keep it. So what is the actua l 
characteristic equation? Maybe I can  finish it. I should stay over here  instead of 
recopying all of it. Well, there is a lot more work to do. Let's see if we can at  least 
write down the equation. What is it? It is lambda^3. What is the lambda^2 term? It 
is six and that  is all there is. How about the lambda term? Well, we have 12 lambda 
minus 3 lambda which makes plus 9 lambda. That looks good but constant terms 
have a way of screw ing everything up. What is the constant term? It is A minus 2 
minus 6. 

Zero. The constant term is zero. That converts this from a hard prob lem to an easy 
problem. Now it is a cinch to calculate the stuff. Let's go to this board and continue 
the work over here. The equation is lambda^3 + 6 lambda^2 + 9 lambda = 0. It is 
very easy to ca lculate the roots of that. You factor it. Lambda is a common factor. 
And what is left? lambda^2 + 6 lambda + 9. That is the sort of thing you got all the 
time when you were studying critica l damping. It is the (lambda + 3)^2. Lambda 
squared p lus 6 lambda plus 9 equa ls zero. 

So the eigenvalues, the roots are what? Well, they are lambda equa ls zero from this 
factor and then  lambda = -3. But what  is new is that the minus 3 is a double root. 
That  is a doub le root. Now, that, of course, is what is going to cause the trouble. 
Because, for each one of these, I am supposed to calculate the eigenvector and 
make up the solution. But that assumed that I had three things to get three d ifferent 
solutions. Here I have only got two things. It is the same troub le we ran into when 
there was a  repeated root. We were studying second or third order differential 
equations and the characteristic equation had a  repeated root. And I had to go into a 
song and dance and stand on my head and multiply things by t and so on. And then 
talk very hard arguing why that was a good thing to do to get the answer. Now, I am 
not going to do the same thing here. 

Instead, I am going to try to solve the problem instead. Let's get two points by at 
least doing the easy part of it. lambda = 0. What am I supposed to do w ith lambda 
equa ls zero? I am looking for the a lpha that goes w ith that. And I find that 
eigenvector by solving this system of equations. Let's write out what that system of 
equations is. Well, if lambda is zero, this isn't there. It is just the matrix A alpha = 0. 
And the matrix A is, I never even wrote it anywhere. I never wrote A. I thought I 
would get away w ithout having to do it, but you never get away w ith anything. It's 
the principle of life. That is A. 

If I subtract zero from the ma in diagonal, that doesn't do a great dea l to A. And the 
resulting system of equations is those same things, except you have the a1's there, 
too. There is one. a1 - 2a2 + a3 = 0. I am just subtracting zero from the main 
diagonal so there is nothing to do. a2 minus 2 a3 equa ls zero. Now I am supposed to 
solve those. Of course we could do  it. Well, how do you know how to solve a system 
of three linear equations? Well, elimination. You can always solve by elimination. 
Now we are much more sophisticated than that. You all have pocket calculators so 
you could use the  inverse matrix, right? No. You cannot use the inverse matrix. 

What will happen if you punch in those coefficients and then punch  in A inverse. 
What answer w ill  it give you? 0, 0, 0. No, I am sorry. It won't give you any answer. 
What will it say? It will say I cannot ca lculate the inverse to that matrix because the 
whole purpose of this exercise was to find a value of lambda such that this system of 
equations is dependent. The coefficient determinant is zero and, therefore, the 
coefficient matrix does not have an inverse matrix. You cannot use that method. In 
other words, the inverse matrix will never work in these problems because the 
system of equations you w ill be trying to solve is a lways a non-independent system. 

And, therefore,  its determinant is always zero. And, therefore, there is no inverse 
matrix because the determinant of the coefficient is zero. All you can do is use 
elimination or physical insight and common sense. Now, because I teach d ifferentia l 
equations everybody assumes, mistakenly, as I think, that I really know something 
about them. I get now and then graduate students, not in mathematics, but some 
obscure field of engineering or whatever drift into my office and say I see you teach 
differentia l equations. Do you have a minute here? And before I can say no they 
write their differential equation on the board. And almost invariab ly it is nothing I 
have ever seen before. And they so look at me hopefully and expectantly. 

So what do I ask them? I don't ask them what they have tried. What I ask them is 
where did this come from? What field d id it come from? Because each field has its 
own little tricks. It gets the same differential equations a ll the time and has its own 

little tricks for so lving them. You should do the same thing here. Well, of course we 
can solve this. And by now most of you have solved  it just by inspection, just by sort 
of psyching out the answer. But a better way is to say look, suppose we had the 
solution, what would the solution look like? Well, it would  look like (a1, a2, a3), 
whatever the values of those variab les were which gave me the solution to the 
equation, times e^(0t). But what is this? 

e^(0t) = 1 for all time. And, therefore, this is a constant solution. What I am asking 
is to  find a constant solution. Now, can I, by inspection, find a constant solution to 
this? If so it must be the one. Well, there is an obvious constant solution. All the cells 
have the same temperature. If that is true then there is no reason why it should ever 
change as time goes on. 

The physica l prob lem itself suggests what the answer must be. You don't have to 
solve equations. In other words, any constant like (1, 1, 1). Well, could it be (20, 20, 
20)? Yeah, that is a constant multip le of (1, 1, 1). That is included. My basic constant 
solution, therefore, is simply (1, 1, 1) e^(0t). You don't have to include e to the 0t 
because it is one. Now, just to check, is (1, 1, 1) a solution to these equations? 

It certa inly is. 1 plus 1 minus 2 is zero in every case. The equations are essentia lly 
the same, except they use different variables. By inspection or, if you like, by 
elimination, but not by finding the inverse matrix you solve those equations. And we 
have our first solution. Now let's go onto the second one. For the second one, we are 
going to have to use the eigenvalue lambda equals negative 3. 

And now what is the system of equations? Well, now I have to take this and I have 
to subtract negative 3 from the diagonal elements. -2 - (-3) = +1, right? Got that? 
Each of the diagonal elements, after I subtract minus 3 turns into plus 1. And, 
therefore, the system becomes, the system I have to solve is a1 + a2 + a3 = 0. And 
what is the second equation? Symmetry is preserved. All the equations are 
essentia lly the same, except for the names of the variab les so they a ll must give you 
the same thing after I subtract minus 3 from the main d iagona l. Well, that is what 
we ca ll a dependent system of equations. 

All I have is the same equation repeated tw ice, but I still have to solve it. Now, what 
you see is that there are lots of solutions to this. Let me write down one of them. For 
example, suppose I made a1 = 1 and I made a2 a 0, then a3 = -1. So here  is a 
solution. That is the eigenvector. And with it, I can make the solution by multip lying 
by e^(-3t). There is a solution. But that  is not the only a lpha I could have chosen. 
Suppose I chose this one instead. Suppose I kept this 1, but this time made a3 zero. 
Well, in that case, there would be a2 = -1. 

Now, is this essentially d ifferent from that one? It would still be multiplied by e^(-
3t), but don't be fooled by the e to the minus 3t. That is our sca lar. That is not what 
is essential. What is essential is the content of these two vectors. Is either one a 
multip le of the other? The answer is no. Therefore, they are independent. They are 
pointing in two different d irections in three space, these two vectors. 

And, therefore, I have two independent solutions just by picking two different 
vectors that solve those three equations. This is also a solution. If I call this the 
eigenvector alpha 1, then I ought to ca ll this one the alpha 2. Hey, we can keep on 
going through this. Why not make the first one zero? Well, what would happen if I 

made the first one 0, and then 1, and minus 1? The answer is this one is no longer 
independent of those two. 

I can get it by taking a comb ination of those two. Do you see what combination I 
should take? This one minus that one. This guy minus that guy gives me that guy, 
isn't that right? 1 minus 1, 0 minus minus 1, minus 1 minus 0. This is not a new one. 
It looks new, but it is not. I can get it by taking a linear combination of these two. It 
is not independent delta. And that would be true for any other possible solution you 
could get for these equations. Once you found two solutions, all the others will be 
linear combinations of them. Well, I cannot use that one. It is not new. And the 
general solution, therefore, will be a combination, c1 times that one plus a constant 
times this one. 

Plus the first one that I found c3 times (1, 1, 1) e^(0t), which I don't have to write 
in. That is the genera l solution to the system, (x1, x2, x3). What happens as time 
goes to infinity? Regard less of what the values of these two C's this term goes to 
zero, that term goes to zero and what I am left with is a constant solution. So all of 
these solutions tend to be the solution where all the cells are at the same 
temperature. Well, of course there must be some vocabulary word in this. There is. 
There are two vocabulary words. This is a good eigenvalue. There are also bad 
eigenvalues. 

This is a good repeated eigenvalue, but good is not the officia l word. An eigenvalue 
like this, which is repeated but where you can  find enough eigenvectors, if lambda is 
a repeated eigenvalue, it occurs multip ly in the characteristic polynomial as a  root. 
But you can find enough independent eigenvectors -- Forget the "but." -- to make up 
the needed number of independent solutions. For examp le, if it is repeated once, 
that is it occurs doubly then somehow I have got to get two solutions out of that as I 
was ab le to here. If  it occurred trip ly, I have got to get three solutions out of it. 

I would look for three independent eigenvectors and hope I could find them. That is 
the good case because it tells you how to make up as many solutions as you need. 
And this kind of eigenvalue is ca lled in the literature the complete eigenvalue. Now, 
how about the kind in which you cannot? Well, unfortunately, a ll my life I have ca lled 
it incomplete, which seems to be a perfectly reasonab le thing to ca ll it. However, 
terminology changes slowly over time. The notes, because I wrote them, ca ll it an 
incomp lete eigenva lue. But the accepted term nowadays is defective. I don't like 
that. 

It violates the "eigenva lues w ith d isab ilities act" or something. But I have to g ive it 
to you because that is the word  I am going to try to use from now on, at least if I 
remember to use it. It would be the word,  for example, used in the linear a lgebra 
course 18.06 "p lug, plug," defective otherwise. A defective eigenva lue is one where 
you can get one eigenvector. If it is doub le, for example, if it a double eigenva lue. It 
is defective if you can get one eigenvector that goes with it, but you cannot find an 
independent one. The only other ones you can find are multip les of the first one. 
Then you are really in troub le because you just don't have enough solutions that you 
are supposed to get out of that, and you have to do something. 

What you do is turn to prob lem two on your problem set and solve it because that 
tells you what to do. And I even g ive you an example to work. Problem two, that 
little matrix has a defective eigenva lue. It doesn't look defective, but you cannot tell. 
It is defective. But you, nonetheless, will be able to  find two solutions because you 

will be following instructions. Now,  the only other thing I should tell you is one of the 
most important theorems in linear algebra, which is totally beyond the scope of this 
course and is beyond the scope of most elementary  linear algebra courses as I have 
taught around the country but, of course, not at MIT. But, nonetheless, it is the last 
theorem in the course. That means it is liab le to use stuff. The theorem goes by 
different names. Sometimes it is ca lled the principle axis theorem. 

Sometimes it  is called the spectral theorem. But, anyway, what it says is,  if A is a 
real end-by-end matrix which  is symmetric, you know what a symmetric matrix is? 
The formal definition is it is equal to its transpose. What that means is if you flip it 
around the ma in diagonal it looks just the same as before. Somewhere on this board, 
right there, in  fact, is a symmetric matrix. What happened to it? R ight here was the 
symmetric matrix. I erased the one thing which I had to have. (-2, 1, 1); (1, -2, 1); 
(1, 1, -2) That was our matrix A. The matrix is symmetric because if I flip it around 
the d iagona l it looks the same as it did before. 

Well, not exactly. The ones are sort of lying on their side, but you have to take 
account of that. Is that right? The twos are backward. Well, you know what I mean. 
Put that element there, this one here, that one there. Exchange these two. Notice 
the d iagona l elements don't all have to be minus 2 for that. No matter what they 
were, they are the guys that aren't moved when you do the flipp ing. 

Therefore, there is no condition on them. It is these other guys. Each guy here has 
to use the same guy there. This one has to be the same as that one, and so on. Then 
it will be real and symmetric. If you have a matrix that is real and symmetric, like 
the one we have been working w ith, the theorem is that all its eigenvalues are 
complete. That is a very unobvious theorem. All  its eigenva lues are automatically 
complete. And it is a  remarkable fact that you can prove that purely genera lly with a 
certain amount of pure reasoning no ca lculation at a ll. But it has to be true, and it is 
true. You w ill find there are whole branches of applied d ifferential equations. 

You know, equilibrium theory, a ll the matrices that you dea l w ith are a lways 
symmetric. And, therefore, this repeated eigenvalues is not something you have to 
worry about,  finding extra solutions. Well, I guess that is the end of the first part of 
the lecture. I have a third of it left. Let's talk fast. I would like to, with the remaining 
time, exp lain to you what to do if you were to get comp lex eigenvalues. 

Now, actually, the answer is follow the same program. In other words, if you solve 
the characteristic equation and you get a comp lex root, follow the program, calculate 
the corresponding complex eigenvectors. In other words, solve the equations. 
Everything will be the same except that the eigenvectors w ill turn out to be complex, 
that is will have complex entries. Don't worry about it. Then form the solutions. The 
solutions are now going to look once aga in like alpha e^((a + bi)t). This will be 
complex and that will be complex, too. This w ill have complex entries. And  then, 
fina lly, take the rea l and imag inary parts. 

Those will be real and they will give real and two solutions. In other words, the 
program is exactly  like what we d id for second-order differentia l equations. We used 
the complex numbers, got comp lex solutions. And then, at the very last step, we 
took the rea l and imag inary parts to get two rea l solutions out of each complex 
number. I would like to give you a simple example of working that out. And it is the 
system x' = x + 2y. 

And y' = -x - y. Because it is springtime, it doesn't feel like spring but it will this 
weekend as it is getting warmer. And since, when I am too tired to make up problem 
sets for you late at night, I watch reruns of Seinfeld. I am  from New York. It is just 
in my b loodstream. Of course, the most interesting character on Seinfeld is George. 
We are going to consider Susan who is the girlfriend who got killed by  licking poison 
envelopes. And George carried on their love affa ir until Susan was disposed of by the 
writers by this strange death. 

And we are going to consider x is modeling Susan's love for George. That is x. And 
George's love for Susan w ill be y. Now, I don't mean the absolute love. If x and y are 
zero, I don't mean that they don't love each other. I just mean that that  is the 
equilibrium value of the love. Everything else is measured as departures from  that. 
So (0, 0) represents the normal amount of love, if love is measured. I don't know 
what love units are. Hearts, I guess. Six hearts, let's say. Now, in what sense does 
this model it? 

This is a norma l equation and this is a neurotic equation. That is why this is George 
and this is Susan who seemed very norma l to me. Susan is a normal person. When y 
is positive that means that George seems to be loving her more today than 
yesterday, and her natura l response is to be more in love with him. That is what 
most people are. If y is negative, hey, what's the matter w ith George? He doesn't 
feel so good. 

Maybe there is something wrong with him. She gets a little mad at him and this goes 
down. x' < 0. And the same way why is this positive? Well, aga in, it is a 
psycholog ica l thing, but a ll the world loves a lover. When Susan is  in love, as she 
feels x is high, that makes her feel good. And she loves everything, in fact. Not just 
George. It is one of those things. You all know what I am ta lking about. Now, 
George, of course, is what makes the writers happy. George is neurotic and, 
therefore, is exactly the opposite. He sees one day that he feels more  in love w ith 
Susan than he was yesterday. 

Does this make him happy? Not at all. Not at all. It makes y prime more negative. 
Why? Because a ll he can think of is, my God, suppose I am rea lly in love with this 
girl? Suppose I marry her. Oh, my God, 40 years of seeing the same person at 
breakfast all the time. I must be crazy. And so it goes down. Here is our neurotic 
model. The question for differential equations is, what do the solutions to that look

In other words, how does, in  fact, their love affa ir go? Now, there is a  reason why 
the writers picked that model, as you w ill see. It means they were able to get a 
year's worth of episodes out of it. And why is that so? Well,  let's solve it. The 
characteristic equation is lambda squared. The matrix that governs this system is A 
equa ls (1, 2; -1, -1). The trace of that matrix, the sum of the diagonal elements is 
zero. There is the zero  lambda here. The determinant, which is the constant term, is 
negative 1, minus negative 2, which is p lus 1. So the characteristic equation, by 
calculating the trace and determinant is lambda^2 + 1 = 0. 

The eigenvalues are plus and minus i. Now, you don't have to pick both of them 
because the negative one lead to essentially the same solutions but w ith negative 
signs. Either one will do just as we solved second order equations. The system  for 
find ing the eigenvectors, well, we are going to have to accept the complex 
eigenvector. What is the system going to be? Well, I take the matrix and I subtract  i. 

We will use i. Subtract i from the main d iagona l. So the system is (1 - i)a1 + 2a2 = 
0. And let's,  for good measure, write the other one down, too. It is -a1 - (1 - i) a2. 

Then what is the solution? Well, you get the solution the usua l way. Let's take a1 = 
1. Then what is a2? a2 = (1 - i)/2 from  the first equation. So the complex solution is 
(1 - i)/2 e^(it). Now you have to take the real and imaginary parts of that. This is 
the only part which technically I would not trust you to do w ithout having someone 
show you how to do it. What do you do? Well, of course, you know how to separate 
the real and imaginary parts of that. It is the first thing is to separate the vectors. 

I don't know how to exp lain this. Just watch. The rea l part of it is 1, one-half. It 
should be negative 1, so minus this plus that because I d idn't put that on the right 
side. It is (1, -1/2) + i(0, 1/2). Anybody want to fight? 1 plus i times 0 minus one-
half plus one-half times i. You saw how I d id that? Okay. When you do these problem 
you do it the same way, but don't ask me to exp lain what I just did. Here it  is cos(t) 
= i(sin(t)). 

And so the real part will give me one solution. The imaginary part will give me 
another. Since I have a limited amount of time, let's just ca lculate the rea l part. 
What is it? Well, it is (1, -1/2)cos(t) - (0, 1/2)sin(t) Now, what solution  is that? This 
is (x, y). Take the final step. It doesn't have to look like that. x = cos(t). Do you see 
that? x = cos(t) + 0*sin(t). What  is y? 

y = -1/2 cos(t) - 1/2 sin(t). Now, you may have the pleasure of show ing eliminating 
t. You get a quadratic polynomial in x and y equals zero. This is an ellipse. As t 
varies, you can see this repeats its va lues at interva ls of 2p i, this gives an ellipse. 
And if you want to use a little computer program, linear phase, this is not in the 
assignment, but the ellipses look like this and go around that way. And that  is the 
model of George and Susan's love. x, Susan. y, George. They go round and round in 
this little love circle, and it stretches on for 26 episodes.
