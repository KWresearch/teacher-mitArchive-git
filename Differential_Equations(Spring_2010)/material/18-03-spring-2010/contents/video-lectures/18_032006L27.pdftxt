18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 27 

As a matter of fact, it plots them very accurately. But it is something you a lso need 
to learn to do yourself, as you will see when we study nonlinear equations. It is a 
skill. And since a couple of important mathematical ideas are involved in it, I think it 
is a very good thing to spend just a little time on, one lecture in fact, p lus a little 
more on the problem set that I will give out. The last problem set that I will give out 
on Friday. I thought it might be a little more fun to, aga in, have a simple-minded 
model. No romance this time. We are going to have a little model of war, but I have 
made it sort of sublimated war. Let's take as the system, I am going to let two of 
those be parameters, you know, be variable, in other words. 

And the other two I will keep fixed, so that you can concentrate on them better. I 
will take a and d to be negative 1 and negative 3. And the other ones we will leave 
open, so let's call this one b times y, and this other one will be c times x. I am going 
to model this as a fight between two states, both of which are trying to attract 
tourists. Let's say this is Massachusetts and this will be New Hampshire, its enemy to 
the North. 

Both are busy advertising these days on television. People are making their summer 
plans. Come to New Hampshire, you know, New Hampshire has mountains and 
Massachusetts has quaint little fishing villages and stuff like that. So what are these 
numbers? Well, first of all, what do x and y represent? x and y basically are the 
advertising budgets for tourism, you know, the amount each state p lans to spend 
during the year. However, I do not want zero va lue to mean they are not spending 
anything. It represents departure from the normal equilibrium. x and y represent 
departures --

-- from the normal amount of money they spend advertising for tourists. The normal 
tourist advertising budget. If they are both zero, it means that both states are 
spending what they normally spend in that year. If x is positive, it means that 
Massachusetts has decided to spend more in the hope of attracting more tourists and 
if negative spending less. What  is the significance of these two coefficients? Those 
are the norma l things which return you to equilibrium. In other words, if x gets 
bigger than norma l, if Massachusetts spends more there  is a certa in poll to spend 
less because we are wasting all this money on the tourists that are not going to 
come when we could be spend ing it on education or something like that. 

If x gets to be negative, the governor tries to spend less. Then a ll the loca l city 
Chamber of Commerce rise up and start screaming that our economy is going to go 
bankrupt because we won't get enough tourists and that is because you are not 
spending enough money. There is a push to a lways return it to the norma l, and that 
is what this negative sign means. The same thing for New Hampshire. What does it 
mean that this is negative three and that is negative one? 

It just means that the Chamber of Commerce yells three times as loudly in New 
Hampshire. It is more sensitive, in other words,  to changes in the budget. Now, how 

about the other? Well, these represent the war-like features of the situation. 
Normally these will be positive numbers. Because when Massachusetts sees that New 
Hampshire has budgeted this year more than its normal amount, the natural instinct 
is we are fighting. This is war. This  is a positive number. We have to budget more, 
too. And the same thing for New Hampshire. The size of these coefficients gives you 
the magnitude of the reaction. If they are sma ll Massachusetts say, well, they are 
spending more but we don't have to  follow them. 

We will bucket a little bit. If it is a big number then oh, my God, heads will roll. We 
have to trip le them and put them out of business. This is a model, in  fact, for all 
sorts of competition. It was used  for many years to model in simper times 
armaments races between countries. It is certa inly a simp le-minded model for any 
two companies in competition with each other if certain conditions are met. 

Well, what I would like to do now is try different va lues of those numbers. And, in 
each case, show you how to sketch the solutions at d ifferent cases. And then,  for 
each different case, we will try to interpret if it makes sense or not. My first set of 
numbers is,  the first case is -- -- x' = -x + 2y. And y' = -3y. 

Now, what does this mean? Well, this means that Massachusetts is behaving 
normally, but New Hampshire is a very placid state, and the governor is busy doing 
other things. And people say Massachusetts is spend ing more this year, and the 
Governor says, so what. The zero is the so what factor. In other words, we are not 
going to respond to them. We will do our own thing. What is the result of this? Is 
Massachusetts going to win out? What is going to be the ultimate effect on the 
budget? Well, what we have to do is, so the program is first let's quickly solve the 
equations using a standard technique. I am just going to make marks on the board 
and trust to the fact that you have done enough of this yourself by now that you 
know what the marks mean. 

I am not going to label what everything is. I am just going to  trust to luck. The 
matrix A = [-1, 2; 0, 3]. The characteristic equation, the second coefficient is the 
trace, which  is minus 4, but you have to change its sign, so that makes it p lus 4. And 
the constant term is the determinant, which is 3 minus 0, so that is p lus 3 equals 
zero. This factors into lambda p lus 3 times lambda plus one. And it means the roots 
therefore are, one root is  lambda equals negative 3 and the other root is lambda 
equa ls negative 1. These are the eigenvalues. W ith each eigenva lue goes an 
eigenvector. The eigenvector is found by solving an equation  for the coefficients of 
the eigenvector,  the components of the eigenvector. 

Here I used negative 1 minus negative 3, which makes 2. The first equation  is 2a1 
plus 2a2 is equal to zero. The second one will be, in fact, in this case simp ly 0a1 plus 
0a2 so it won't give me any information at a ll. That is not what usually happens, but 
it is what happens in this case. What is the solution? The solution is the vector a lpha 
equa ls, well, (1; -1) would be a good thing to use. That is the eigenvector, so this is 
the e-vector. How about lambda equa ls negative 1? Let's g ive it a  little more room. If 
lambda is negative 1 then here I put negative 1 minus negative 1. That makes zero. 

I w ill write in the zero because this  is confusing. It is zero times a1. And the next 
coefficient is 2 a2,  is zero. People sometimes go bananas over this, in spite of the 
fact that this is the easiest possible case you can get. I guess if they go bananas 
over it, it proves it is not a ll that easy, but it is easy. What now is the eigenvector 
that goes w ith this? Well, this term isn't there. It is zero. 

The equation says that a2 has to be zero. And it doesn't say anything about a1, so 
let's make it 1. Now, out of this data, the final step is to make the genera l solution. 
What is it? (x, y) equa ls, well, a constant times the first normal mode. The solution 
constructed from the eigenva lue and the eigenvector. That is going to be (1, -1) 
e^(-3t). And then the other normal mode times an arbitrary constant will be (1, 0) 
e^(-t). The lambda is this factor which produces that, of course. Now, one way of 
looking at  it is, first of all, get clearly in your head this is a pair of parametric 
equations just like what you stud ied in 18.02. 

Let's write them out explicitly just this once. x = c1 e^(-3t) + c2 e^(-t). And what  is 
y? y = -c1 e^(-3t). I can stop there. In some sense, all I am asking you to do is p lot 
that curve. In the x,y-p lane, plot the curve g iven by this pair of parametric 
equations. And you can choose your own values of c1, c2. For different values of c1 
and c2 there will be d ifferent curves. Give me a  feeling for what they all look like. 
Well, I think most of you will recognize you didn't have stuff like this. These weren't 
the kind of curves you p lotted. 

When you d id parametric equations in 18.02, you did stuff like x = cos(t), y = sin(t). 
Everybody knows how to do  that. A few other curves which made lines or nice 
things, but nothing that ever looked like that. And so the computer w ill p lot  it by 
actually ca lculating values but, of course, we will not. That is the significance of the 
word sketch. I am not asking you to p lot carefully, but to g ive me some genera l 
geometric p icture of what all these curves look like w ithout doing any work. 

Without doing any work. Well, that sounds promising. Okay, let's try to do it w ithout 
doing any work. Where shall I begin? Hidden in this formula are four solutions that 
are extremely easy to plot. So begin with the four easy solutions, and then  fill in the 
rest. Now, which are the easy solutions? The easy solutions are c1 equals plus or 
minus 1, c2 equa ls zero, or c1 equa ls zero, or c1 = 0, c2 equa ls plus or minus 1. 

By choosing those four va lues of c1 and c2, I get simple solutions corresponding to 
the norma l mode. If c1 is one and c2 is zero, I am talking about (1, -1) e^(-3t), and 
that is very easy plot. Let's start plotting them. What I am going to do is color-code 
them so you w ill be able to recognize what it is I am plotting. Let's see. What colors 
should we use? We w ill use pink and orange. This w ill be our pink solution and our 
orange solution will be this one. Let's plot the pink solution first. The pink solution 
corresponds to c1 = 0 and c2 = 0. Now, that solution looks like --

Let's write  it in pink. No, let's not write it  in pink. What is the solution? It looks like x 
= e^(-3t), y = -e^(-3t). Well,  that's not a good way to look at  it, actua lly. The best 
way to look at  it is to say at t equa ls zero, where is it? It is at the point (1, -1). And 
what is it doing as t increases? Well, it keeps the d irection, but travels. The 
amplitude, the distance from the origin keeps shrinking. As t increases, this factor, 
so it  is the tip of this vector, except the vector is shrinking. It  is still in the direction 
of (1, -1), but it is shrinking in length because its amplitude is shrinking according to 
the law e^(-3t). 

In other words, this curve looks like this. At t equals zero it  is over here, and it goes 
along this d iagona l line until as t equa ls  infinity,  it gets to infinity, it reaches the 
orig in. Of course, it never gets there. It goes slower and slower and slower in order 
that it may never reach the orig in. What was it doing for values of t less than zero? 
The same thing, except it was further away. It comes in from infinity along that 

straight line. In other words, the eigenvector determines the line on which it travels 
and the eigenva lue determines which way it goes. If the eigenvalue is negative, it is 
approaching the orig in as t increases. How about the other one? Well,  if c1 = -1, 
then everything is the same except it is the mirror image of this one. 

If c1 is negative 1, then at t equals zero it is at this point. And, once again, the same 
reasoning shows that it is coming into the origin as t  increases. I have now two 
solutions, this one correspond ing to c1 = 1, and the other one c2 = 0. This one 
corresponds to c1 equa ls negative 1. How about the other guy, the orange guy? 
Well, now c1 is zero, c2  is one,  let's say. 

It is the vector (1, 0), but otherw ise everything  is the same. I start now at the point 
(1, 0) at time zero. And, as t increases, I come  into the orig in always a long that 
direction. And before that I came  in from infinity. And, aga in, if c2 = 1 and if c2 = -
1, I do the same thing but on the other side. That wasn't very hard. I p lotted  four 
solutions. And now I roll up my sleeves and waive my hands to try to get others. The 
general philosophy is the follow ing. The general philosophy  is the differentia l 
equation looks like this. It is a system of differentia l equations. These are continuous 
functions. 

That means when I draw the velocity field correspond ing to that system of 
differentia l equations, because their functions are continuous, as I move from one (x, 
y) point to another the direction of the velocity vectors change continuously. It never 
suddenly reverses without something like that. Now, if that changes continuously 
then the trajectories must change continuously,  too. In other words, nearby 
trajectories should be doing approximately the same thing. Well, that means all the 
other trajectories are ones which come  like that must be going also toward the 
orig in. If I start here, probably I have to follow this one. They are all coming to the 
orig in, but that is a little too vague. How do they come to the orig in? In other words, 
are they coming in stra ight like that? Probably not. Then what are they doing? 

Now we are coming to the only point in the lecture which you might find a little 
difficult. Try to  follow what I am doing now. If you don't follow,  it is not well done in 
the textbook, but it is very well done in the notes because I wrote them myself. 
Please, it is done very carefully  in the notes, patiently follow through the 
exp lanation. It takes about that much space. It is one of the important  ideas that 
your engineering professors will expect you to understand. 

Anyway, I know this only from  the negative one because they say to me at lunch, 
ruin my lunch by saying I sa id it to my students and got nothing but b lank looks. 
What do you guys teach them over there? Blah, blah, blah. Maybe we ought to start 
teaching it ourselves. Sure. Why don't they start cutting their own ha ir, too? Here is 
the idea. Let me recopy that solution. The solution looks like c1 (1, -1) e^(-3t) + c2 
(1, 0) e^(-t). 

What I ask is as t goes to infinity, I feel sure that the trajectories must be coming 
into  the origin because these guys are doing that. And, in fact, that is confirmed. As t 
goes to infinity, this goes to zero and that goes to zero regard less of what the c1 and 
c2 are. That makes it clear that this goes to zero no matter what the c1 and c2 are 
as t goes to infinity, but I would like to analyze it a little more carefully. 

As t goes to infinity, I have the sum of two terms. And what I ask is, which term is 
dominant? Of these two terms, are they of equa l importance, or is one more 

important than the other? When t is 10,  for example, that is not very far on the way 
to infinity, but it is certa inly far enough to illustrate. Well, e^(-10) is an extremely 
sma ll number. The only thing smaller is e^(-30). The term that dominates, they are 
both small, but relatively-speaking this one is much  larger because this one only has 
the factor e^(-10), whereas, this has the factor e^(-30), which is vanishing ly sma ll. 
In other words, as t goes to infinity --

Well, let's write it the other way. This is the dominant term, as t goes to infinity. 
Now, just the opposite is true as t goes to minus infinity. t going to minus infinity 
means I am backing up a long these curves. As t goes to minus infinity, let's say t 
gets to be -100, this is e^(100), but this is e^(300), which is much, much bigger. So 
this is the dominant term as t goes to negative  infinity. 

Now what I have is the sum of two vectors. Let's first look at what happens as t goes 
to infinity. As t goes to infinity, I have the sum of two vectors. This one  is comp letely 
neg ligib le compared with the one on the right-hand side. In other words, for a a ll 
intents and purposes, as t goes to infinity, it is this thing that takes over. Therefore, 
what does the solution  look like as t goes to infinity? The answer is it follows the 
yellow line. Now, what does it look like as it backs up? As it came in from negative 
infinity, what does it look like? Now, this one is a little harder to see. 

This is big, but this is infinity bigger. I mean very, very much bigger, when t is a 
large negative number. Therefore, what I have is the sum of a very big vector. 
You're stand ing on the moon looking at the blackboard, so  this is really b ig. This is a 
very big vector. This is one million meters long, and this is only 20,000 meters long. 
That  is this guy, and that  is this guy. I want the sum of those two. What does the 
sum look like? The answer is a sum is approximately parallel to the  long guy because 
this is neglig ible. This does not mean they are next to each other. They are slightly 
tilted over, but not very much. In other words, as t goes to negative infinity it 
doesn't coincide with this vector. 

The solution doesn't, but it is para llel to it. It has the same d irection. I am done. It 
means far away from the orig in, it should be parallel to  the p ink line. Near the orig in 
it should turn and become more or less coincident with the orange line. And those 
were the solutions. That's how they look. How about down here? The same thing, 
like that, but then after a while they turn and join. Here, they have to turn around to 
join up, but they join. And that is, in a simple way, the sketches of those functions. 
That  is how they must look. What does this say about our state? 

Well, it says that the fact that the governor of New Hampshire  is indifferent to what 
Massachusetts is doing produces ultimately harmony. Both states revert ultimately 
their norma l advertising budgets in spite of the fact that Massachusetts is keep ing an 
eye peeled out for the slightest misbehavior on the part of New Hampshire. Peace 
reins, in other words. Now you should know some names. Let's see. I will write 
names  in purple. There are two words that are used to describe this situation. First is 
the word that describes the genera l pattern of the way these lines look. The word for 
that is a node. And the fact that all the trajectories end up at the origin  for that one 
uses the word sink. This could be modified to nodal sink. That would be better. Nodal 
sink, let's say. 

Nodal sink or, if you like to write them  in the opposite order, sink node. In the same 
way there would be something called a source node if I reversed all the arrows. I am 
not going to ca lculate an examp le. Why don't I simply do it by g iving you -- For 

example, if the matrix A produced a solution instead of that one. Suppose it looked 
like (1, -1) e^(3t). The eigenva lues were reversed, were now positive. And  I w ill 
make the other one positive, too. c2 (1, 0) e^(t). 

What would that change  in the picture? The answer is essentia lly nothing, except the 
direction of the arrows. In other words, the first thing would still be (1, -1). The only 
difference is that now as t  increases we go the other way. And here the same thing, 
we have still the same basic vector, the same basic orange vector, orange line, but it 
has now  traversed the solution. We traverse it in the opposite direction. 

Now, let's do the same thing about dominance, as we did before. Which term 
dominates as t goes to infinity? This is the dominant term. Because, as t goes to 
infinity, 3t  is much b igger than t. This one, on the other hand, dominates as t goes 
to negative infinity. How now will the solutions look like? Well, as t goes to infinity, 
they follow the pink curve. Whereas, as t starts out from negative infinity, they 
follow the orange curve. 

As t goes to infinity, they become parallel to the pink curve, and as t goes to 
negative  infinity, they are very close to the origin and are follow ing the yellow curve. 
This is pink and this is yellow. They look like this. Notice the picture basica lly is the 
same. It is the p icture of a node. All that has happened is the arrows are reversed. 
And, therefore,  this would be called a noda l source. The word source and sink 
correspond to what you  learned in 18.02 and 8.02, I hope, a lso, or you could ca ll it a 
source node. Both phrases are used, depending on how you want to use it in a 
sentence. 

And another word  for this, this would be ca lled unstable because a ll of the solutions 
starting out from near the origin ultimately end up infinitely far away from the origin. 
This would be called stab le. In fact, it would be called asymptotica lly stab le. I don't 
like the word asymptotica lly, but it has become standard in the literature. And, more 
important, it is standard in your textbook. And  I don't like to fight w ith a textbook. It 
just ends up confusing everybody, including me. That is enough for nodes. I would 
like to talk now about some of the other cases that can occur because they lead to 
completely different p ictures that you should understand. Let's look at the case 
where our governors behave a little more bad ly, a little more combatively. 

It is x' = -x as before, but this time a firm response by Massachusetts to any sign of 
increased activity by stockpiling of advertising budgets. Here let's say New 
Hampshire now is even worse. F ive times, quintuple or whatever increase 
Massachusetts makes, of course they don't have an income tax, but they will 
manage. Minus 3y as before. Let's aga in calculate quickly what the characteristic 
equation is. 

Our matrix is now negative(1, 3; 5, -3). The characteristic equation now is 
lambda^2 + 4 lambda - 12. And this, because I prepared very carefully, all 
eigenvalues are integers. And so this factors into (lambda + 6)(lambda - 2), does it 
not? 

Yes. 6  lambda minus 2 is four lambda. Good. What do we have? Well, first of all we 
have our eigenvalue lambda, negative 6. And the eigenvector that goes with that is 
minus 1. This  is negative 1 minus negative 6 which makes, shut your eyes, 5. We 
have 5a1 + 3a2 = 0. And the other equation, I hope it comes out to be something 
similar. I d idn't check. I am hop ing this is right. The eigenvector is, okay, you have 

been taught to a lways make one of the 1, forget about that. Just p ick numbers that 
make it come out right. I am going to make this one 3, and then I will make this one 
negative 5. 

As I say, I have a policy of integers only. I am a number theorist at heart. That is 
how I started out life anyway. There we have data from which we can make one 
solution. How about the other one? The other one will correspond to  the eigenva lue 
lambda equals 2. This time the equation is negative 1 minus 2 is negative 3. It is -
3a1 + 3a2 = 0. And now the eigenvector is (1, 1). Now we are ready to draw 
pictures. We are going to make this similar ana lysis, but it w ill go  faster now because 
you have a lready had the experience of that. F irst of a ll, what is our genera l 
solution? It is going to be c1*(3, -5) e^(-6t) + c2(1, 1)e^(2t). 

And then the other normal mode times an arb itrary constant w ill be (1, 1) e^(2t). I 
am going to use the same strategy. We have our two normal modes here, 
eigenvalue, eigenvector solutions from which, by ad justing these constants, we can 
get our four basic solutions. Those are going to look like, let's draw a p icture here. 
Again, I w ill color-code them. Let's use p ink again. The pink solution now starts at 
(3, -5). That is where it is when t is zero. And, because of the coefficient minus 6 up 
there, it is coming into the origin and looks like that. 

And its mirror image, of course, does the same thing. That is when c1 is negative 
one. How about the orange guy? Well, when t is equal to zero, it is at (1, 1). But 
what is it doing after that? As t increases, it is getting  further away from the origin 
because the sign here is positive. e^(2t) is increasing, it is not decreasing anymore, 
so this guy is going out. And its mirror image on the other side is doing the same 
thing. Now all we have to do is fill in the p icture. Well, you fill it in by continuity. 
Your nearby trajectories must be doing what similar thing? 

If I start out very near the p ink guy, I should stay near the p ink guy. But as I get 
near the orig in, I am a lso approaching the orange guy. Well, there is no other 
possibility other than that. If you are further away you start turning a little sooner. I 
am just using an argument from continuity to say the picture must be roughly filled 
out this way. Maybe not exactly. In fact, there are fine points. 

And I am going to ask you to do one of them on Friday for the new problem set, 
even before the exam, God forb id. But I want you to get a  little more experience 
working w ith that linear phase portra it visual because it is, I think, one of the best 
ones this semester. You can learn a  lot from it. Anyway, you are not done w ith it, but 
I hope you have at least looked at it by now. That is what the picture looks like. First 
of all, what are we going to name this? 

In other words, forget about the arrows. If you just  look at the general way those 
lines go, where have you seen this before? You saw this in 18.02. What was the 
topic? You were p lotting contour curves of functions, were you not? What d id you call 
contours curves that formed that pattern? A saddle point. You called this a saddle 
point because  it was  like the center of a saddle. It is like a mountain pass. Here you 
are going up the mounta in, say, and here you are going down, the way the contour 
line is going down. And this is sort of a min and max point. A maximum if you go in 
that direction and a minimum  if you go in that d irection, say. W ithout the arrows on 
it, it  is like a sadd le point. And so the same word is used here. It is called the saddle. 
You don't say point in the same way you don't say a nodal point. 

It is the whole p icture, as it were, that is the saddle. It is a saddle. There is the 
saddle. This is where you sit. Now, should I ca ll  it a source or a sink? I cannot call it 
either because it is a sink along these lines, it is a source along those lines and a long 
the others, it starts out looking like a sink and then turns around and starts acting 
like a source. The word source and sink are not used for saddle. The only word that 
is used is unstable because definitely it is unstable. If you start off exactly on the 
pink lines you do end up at the origin, but if you start anywhere else ever so close to 
a pink line you think you are going to the orig in, but then at the last minute you are 
zooming off out to infinity again. This is a typica l example of instab ility. 

Only if you do the mathematically possib le, but physically impossible thing of starting 
out exactly on the pink line, only then will you get to the origin. If you start out 
anywhere else, make the slightest error in measure and get off the pink line, you 
end off at  infinity. What is the effect w ith our war-like governors fighting for the 
tourist trade willing to spend any amounts of money to match and overmatch what 
their competitor in the nearby state is spend ing? 

The answer is, they all lose. Since it is mostly this section of the diagram that makes 
sense, what happens is they end up all spend ing an infinity of dollars and nobody 
gets any more tourists than anybody else. So this is a model of what not to do. I 
have one more model to show you. Maybe we better start over at this board here. 
Massachusetts on top. New Hampshire on the bottom. x' is going to be, that is 
Massachusetts, I guess as before. Let me get the numbers right. 

Leave that out for a moment. y' = 2x - 3y. New Hampshire behaves norma lly. It is 
ready to respond to anything Massachusetts can put out. But by  itself, it rea lly wants 
to bring its budget to norma l. Now, Massachusetts, we have a Mormon governor 
now, I guess. Imag ine instead we have a Buddhist governor. A Buddhist governor 
reacts as follows, minus y. What does that mean? It means that when he sees New 
Hampshire increasing the budget, his reaction is, we w ill lower ours. 

We will show them love. It  looks suicidal, but what actually happens? Well, our little 
program is over. Our matrix a = (-1, -1; 2, -3). The characteristic equations is 
lambda^2 + 4 lambda. And now what  is the other term? 3 minus negative 2 makes 
5. This  is not going to factor because I tried it out and I know it  is not going to 
factor. We are going to get lambda equa ls, we w ill just use the quadratic formula, 
negative 4 p lus or minus the square root of 16 minus 4 times 5, that is 16 minus 20 
or negative 4 all d ivided by 2, which makes minus 2, pull out the 4, that makes it a 
2, cancels this 2, minus 1 inside. 

It is -2 +/- i. Comp lex solutions. What are we doing to do about that? Well, you 
should  rejoice when you get this case and are asked to sketch it because, even if you 
calculate the comp lex eigenvector and from that take its real and  imaginary parts of 
the complex solution, in fact, you w ill not be able easily to sketch the answer 
anyway. But let me show you what sort of thing you can get and then I am going to 
wave my hands and argue a little bit to try to indicate what it is that the solution 
actually looks like. You are going to get something that looks like --

A typ ica l real solution is going to look  like this. This  is going to produce e^(-
2t)*e^( it). e^((-2 + i)t). This will be our exponential factor which is shrinking in 
amplitude. This is going to g ive me sines and cosines. When I separate out the 
eigenvector into its real and imaginary parts, it is going to look something like this. 

(a1, a2) cos(t), that is from the e^(it) part. Then there will be a sine term. And all 
that is going to be multip lied by the exponentia l factor e^(-2t). That is just one 
normal mode. It is going to be c1 times this p lus c2 times something similar. It 
doesn't matter exactly what it is because they are a ll going to look the same. 
Namely, this is a shrinking amplitude. I am not going to worry about that. My real 
question is, what does this look like? In other words, as a pair of parametric 
equations, if x = a1 cos(t) + b1 sin(t) and y = a2 cos(t) + b2 sin(t), what does it 
look like? 

Well, what are its characteristics? In the first p lace, as a curve this part of it is 
bounded. It stays w ithin some large box because cosine and sine never get b igger 
than one and never get smaller than minus one. It is period ic. As t --> t + 2pi,  it 
comes back to exactly the same point it was at before. We have a curve that is 
repeating itself periodically, it does not go off to infinity. And here is where I am 
waving my hands. It satisfies an equation. Those of you who like to fool around with 
mathematics a little bit, it is not d ifficult to show this, but it satisfies an equation of 
the form (Ax^2 + By^2 + Cxy = D. 

All you have to do is figure out what the coefficients A, B, C and D should be. And 
the way to do it is, if you calculate the square of x you are going to get cosine 
squared, sine squared and a cosine sine term. You are going to get those same three 
terms here and the same three terms here. You just use undetermined coefficients, 
set up a system of simultaneous equations and you will be ab le to find the A, B, C 
and D that work. 

I am looking for a curve that is bounded, keeps repeating its va lues and that satisfies 
a quadratic equation which looks like this. Well, an earlier generation would know 
from high school, these curves are all conic sections. The only curves that satisfy 
equations like that are hyperbola, parabolas, the conic sections in other words, and 
ellipses. C ircles are a specia l kind of ellipses. There is a degenerate case. 

A pa ir of lines which can be considered a degenerate hyperbola, if you want. It is as 
much a hyperbola as a circle, as an ellipse say. Which of these is it? Well, it must be 
those guys. Those are the only guys that stay bounded and repeat themselves 
period ica lly. The other guys don't do that. These are ellipses. And, therefore, what 
do they look  like? Well, they must look like an ellipse that is trying to be an ellipse, 
but each time it goes around the point is pulled a little closer to the origin. It must 
be doing this, in other words. And such a point  is ca lled a spiral sink. Aga in sink 
because, no matter where you start, you will get a curve that sp ira ls into the origin. 
Spiral is self-explanatory. And the one thing I haven't told you that you must read is 
how do you know that  it goes around counterclockw ise and not clockwise? 

Read clockw ise or counterclockw ise. I w ill g ive you the answer in 30 seconds, not for 
this particular curve. That you w ill have to calculate. All you have to do is put in 
somewhere. Let's say at the point (1, 0), a single vector from the velocity field. In 
other words, at the point (1, 0), when x is 1 and y is 0 our vector is (-1, 2), which is 
the vector minus 1, 2, it goes like this. Therefore, the motion must be 
counterclockwise. And, by the way, what is the effect of having a Buddhist governor? 
Peace. 

Everything sp ira ls  into the origin and everybody is left w ith the same advertising 
budget they always had. Thanks.
