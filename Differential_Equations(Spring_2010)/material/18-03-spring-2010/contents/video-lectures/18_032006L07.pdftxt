18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 7 

This is also written in the form, it's the k that's on the right hand side. Actua lly, I 
found that source is of considerable difficulty. And, in genera l, it is. For these, the 
temperature concentration model, it's natura l to have the k on the right-hand side, 
and to separate out the (q)e as part of it. Another model for which that's true is 
mixing, as I think I will show you on Monday. On the other hand, there are some 
common first-order models for which it's not a natural way to separate things out. 
Examples would be the RC circuit, radioactive decay, stuff like that. 

So, this  is not a universa l utility. But I thought that that form of writing it was a 
sufficient utility to make a specia l case, and I emphasize it very heavily in the nodes. 
Let's look at the equation. And, this form w ill be good enough, the y'. When you 
solve it, let me remind you how the solutions look, because that explains the 
terminology. The solution looks like, after you have done the integrating  factor and 
multip lied through, and integrated both sides, in short, what you're supposed to do, 
the solution looks like y equals, there's the term e^(-k) out front times an integral 
which you can either make definite or indefinite, accord ing to your preference. 

Integral(q(t) e^(kt) dt), it w ill help you to remember the opposite signs if you think 
that when q is a constant, one, for example, you want these two guys to cancel out 
and produce a constant solution. That's a good way to remember that the signs have 
to be opposite. But, I don't encourage you to remember the formula at a ll. It's just a 
convenient thing  for me to be ab le to use right now. 

And then, there's the other term, which comes by putting up the arbitrary constant 
exp licitly, ce^(-kt). So, you could either write it this way, where this is somewhat 
vague, or you could make it definite by putting a zero here and a t there, and change 
the dummy variable inside according to the way the notes tell you to do it. Now, 
when you do  this, and if k is positive,  that's absolutely essentia l, only when that  is 
so, then this term, as I told you a week or so ago, this term goes to zero because k 
is positive as t goes to infinity. So, this goes to zero as t goes, and it doesn't matter 
what c is, as t goes to infinity. This term stays some sort of function. And so, this 
term is called the steady-state or long-term solution, or it's ca lled both, a long-term 
solution. 

And this, which disappears, gets smaller and smaller as time goes on, is therefore 
called the transient because it disappears at the time increases to infinity. So, this 
part uses the initia l condition, uses the initia l value. Let's call it y(0), assuming that 
you started the initial value, t, when t was equa l to zero, which is a common thing to 
do, although of course not necessary. 

The starting value appears in this term. This one is just some function. Now, the 
general picture or the way that looks is,  the steady-state solution will be some 
solution like, I don't know, like that, let's say. So, that's a steady-state solution,  the 
SSS. Well, what do the other guys look like? Well, the steady-state solution has this 
starting point. Other solutions can have any of these other starting points. So, in the 

beginning, they won't look like the steady-state solution. But, we know that as time 
goes on, they must approach  it because this term represents the d ifference between 
the solution and the steady-state solution. 

So, this term is going to zero. And  therefore, whatever these guys do  to start out 
with, after a while they must follow the steady-state solution more and more closely. 
They must, in short, be asymptotic to it. So, the solutions to any equation of that 
form will look like this. Up here, maybe it started at 127. That's okay. After a while, 
it's going to start approaching that green curve. Of course, they won't cross each 
other. That's the rock star, and these are the groupies trying to get close to it. Now, 
but something  follows from that p icture. Which  is the steady-state solution? What, in 
short, is so specia l about this green curve? All these other white solution curves have 
that same property, the same property that a ll the other white curves and the green 
curve,  too, are trying to get close to them. 

In other words, there is nothing special about the green curve. It's just that they all 
want to get close to each other. And therefore, though you can write a formula like 
this, there isn't one steady-state solution. There are many. Now, this produces 
vagueness. You talk about the steady-state solution; which one are you ta lking 
about? I have no answer to that; the usual answer is whichever one looks simplest. 
Normally,  the one that w ill look simp lest is the one where c is zero. But, if this is a 
peculiar function, it might be that for some other va lue of c, you get an even simp ler 
expression. So, the steady-state solution: about the best I can see, either you 
integrate that, don't use an arbitrary constant, and use what you get, or pick the 
simplest. 

Pick the va lue of c, which g ives you the simp lest answer. P ick the simplest function, 
and that's what usually called the steady-state solution. Now, from that point of 
view, what I'm calling the input in this input response point of view, which we are 
going to be using, by the way, constantly, well, pretty much a ll term long, but 
certainly for the next month or so, I'm constantly going to be coming back to it. The 
input is the q(t). In other words, it seems rather peculiar. But the input is the right-
hand side of the equation of the differentia l equation. And the reason is because I'm 
always thinking of the temperature model. 

The externa l water bath at temperature T external, the internal thing here, the 
problem is, g iven this function,  the externa l water bath temperature is driving, so to 
speak, the temperature of the inside. And therefore, the input  is the temperature of 
the water bath. I don't like the word output, a lthough it would be the natural thing 
because this temperature doesn't look like an output. Anyone might be w illing  to say, 
yeah, you are inputting the va lue of the temperature here. This, it's more likely, the 
normal term is response. This thing, this plus the water bath, is a little system. And 
the response of the system, i.e. the change  in the internal temperature is governed 
by the driving external temperature. So, the input is q(t), and the response of the 
system is the solution to the differentia l equation. 

Now, if the thing is special, as it's going to be for most of this period, it has that 
special form, then I'm going to, I rea lly want to call (q)e the input. I want to call q 
sub e the input, and there is no standard way of doing that, a lthough there's a most 
common way. So, I'm just calling it the physica l input, in other words, the 
temperature input, or the concentration input. And, that w ill be my (q)e (t) and by 
the subscript e, you will understand that I'm writing it in that form and thinking of 
this model, or concentration model, or mixing model as I will show you on Monday. 

By the way, this is often handled, I mean, how would you hand le this to get rid of a 
k? Well, divide through by k. So, this equation is often, in the literature, written this 
way: (1/k)*y' + y = (q)e (t). They ca ll it q of t, not (q)e of t because they've gotten 
rid of this funny factor. But I will continue to ca ll it (q)e. So,  in other words, and this 
part this is just, frankly, called the input. It doesn't say physica l or anything. And, 
this is the solution, it's then the response, and this funny coefficient of y', that's not 
in standard linear form, is it, anymore? But, it's a standard form if you want to do 
this input response ana lysis. So, this  is also a way of writing the equation. 

I'm not going to use  it because how many standard forms could this poor little 
course absorb? I'll stick to that one. Okay, you have, then, the superposition 
principle, which I don't think I'm going to-- the solution, which solution? Well, 
normally  it means any solution, or in other words, the steady-state solution. Now, 
notice that terminology only makes sense if k > 0. And, in fact, there is nothing like 
the p icture, the picture doesn't look at all like this if k is negative, and therefore, the 
terms would steady state, transient would be totally inappropriate if k were negative. 
So, this assumes definitely that k has to be greater than zero. 

Otherw ise, no. So, I'll call this the physica l input. And then, you have the 
superposition principle, which I rea lly can't improve upon what's written in the notes, 
this superposition of inputs. Whether they are physical inputs or nonphysica l inputs, 
if the input q of t produces the response, y of t, and q2 (t) --> y2 (t), -- -- then a 
simple ca lculation w ith the differential equation shows you that by, so to speak, 
adding, that the sum of these two, I stated it very generally in the notes but it 
corresponds, we will have as the response y1, the steady-state response y1 + y2, 
and a constant times y1. 

That's an expression, essentially, of the linear, it uses the fact that the specia l form 
of the equation, and we will have a very efficient and elegant way of seeing this 
when we study higher order equations. For now, I will just, the little calculation 
that's done in the notes will suffice for first-order equations. If you don't have a 
complicated equation, there's no point in making a fuss over proofs using it. But 
essentia lly, it uses the fact that the equation is linear. 

Or, that's bad, so linearity of the ODE. In other words, it's a consequence of the fact 
that the equation looks the way it does. And, something like this would not, in any 
sense, be true if the equation,  for examp le, had here a y^2 instead of t. Everything 
I'm saying this period would be tota l nonsense and tota lly inapplicable. Now, today, 
what I wanted to d iscuss was, what's in the notes that I gave you today, which is, 
what happens when the physical input is trigonometric? For certa in reasons, that's 
the most important case there is. It's because of the existence of what are ca lled 
Fourier series, and  there are a coup le of words about them. That's something we will 
be studying in about three weeks or so. 

What's going on, roughly, is that, so I'm going to take the equation in the form y' + 
ky = k q(e) (t), and the input that I'm interested in is when this is a simple one that 
you use on the visua l that you did about two points worth of work for handing in 
today, cos(omega t). So, if you like, k here. So,  the (q)e is cosine omega t. That was 
the physica l input. And, omega, as you know, is, you have to be careful when you 
use the word frequency. I assume you got this from physics class all  last semester. 
But anyway, just to remind you, there's a whole yoga of five or six terms that go 
whenever you're talking about trigonometric functions. 

Instead of giving a  long exp lanation, the end of the second page of the notes just 
gives you a  reference list of what you are expected to know for 18.03 and physics as 
well, with a brief one or two line description of what each of those means. So, think 
of it as something to refer back to  if you have forgotten. But, omega is what's ca lled 
the angular frequency or the circular frequency. It's somewhat mislead ing to call it 
the frequency, a lthough I probab ly will. 

It's the angular frequency. It's, in other words, it's the number of complete 
oscillations. This cos(omega t) is going up and down right? So, a comp lete oscillation 
as it goes down and then returns to where it started. That's a complete oscillation. 
This is only ha lf an oscillation because you d idn't give it a chance to get back. Okay, 
so the number of comp lete oscillations in how much time, well, in two pi, in the 
distance, two pi on the t-axis in the interva l of length two pi because, for example, if 
omega is one, cos(t) takes two pi to repeat itself, right? 

If omega were two, it would  repeat itself. It would make two complete oscillations in 
the interval, two p i. So, it's what happens to the interva l, two pi, not what happens 
in the time interval, one, which  is the natura l meaning of the word frequency. 
There's always this factor of two pi that floats around to make all of your formulas 
and solutions incorrect. Okay, now, so, what I'm out to do is, the problem is for the 
physical input, (q)e cos(omega t), find the response. In other words, solve the 
differentia l equation. 

In short,  for the visual that you looked at, I think I've forgot the colors now. The 
input was in green, maybe, but I do remember that the response was in yellow. I 
think I remember that. So, find the response, yellow, and the  input was, what color 
was it, green? Blue, b lue. Light blue. Okay, so we've got to solve the differential 
equation. Now, it's a question of how I'm going to solve the d ifferentia l equation. I'm 
going to use complex numbers throughout, A because that's the way it's usually 
done. B, to give you practice using complex numbers, and I don't think I need any 
other reasons. 

So, I'm going  to use comp lex numbers. I'm going to comp lexify. To use comp lex 
numbers, what you do is complexification of the problem. So, I'm going to 
complexify the problem, turn  it into the domain of complex numbers. So, take the 
differentia l equation, turn it into a differential equation involving comp lex numbers, 
solve that, and then go back to the rea l doma in to get the answer, since it's easier to 
integrate exponentials. And therefore, try to introduce, try to change the 
trigonometric functions into comp lex exponentia ls, simply because the work w ill be 
easier to do. All right, so let's do  it. 

To change this differentia l equation, remember, I've got cos(omega t) here. I'm 
going to use the fact that e^(i omega t), Euler's formula, that the rea l part of it is 
cos(omega t). So, I'm going  to view this as the real part of this comp lex function. 
But, I w ill throw at the imag inary part, too, since at one point we w ill need it. Now, 
what is the equation, then, that it's going to turn into? 

The complexified equation  is going to be y' + ky = k e^(i omega t). Now, I have a 
problem because y, here, in this equation, y means the real function which solves 
that problem. I therefore cannot continue to ca ll this y because I want y to be a  real 
function. I have to change its name. Since this is complex function on the right-hand 
side, I will have to expect a complex solution to  the d ifferential equation. 

I'm going to call that comp lex solution y tilda. Now, that's what I would a lso use as 
the designation for the variab le. So, y tilda is the complex solution. And, it's going to 
have the form y1 +  i*y2. It's going to be the complex solution. And now, what I say 
is, so, solve it. Find this comp lex solution. So, find the program is to find y tilde, -- --
that's the complex solution. And then I say, all you have to do is take the rea l part of 
that, and that will answer the original problem. Then, y1, that's the real part of it, 
right? It's a function, you know, like this is cosine p lus sine, as it was over here, it 
will naturally be something different. It w ill be something different, but that part of 
it, the real part w ill solve the origina l problem,  the orig ina l, real, ODE. 

Now, you w ill say, you expect us to believe that? Well, yes, in fact. I think we've got 
a lot to do, so since the argument for this is given in the nodes, so, read this in the 
notes. It only takes a line or two of standard work w ith differentiation. So, read in 
the notes the argument for that, why that's so. It just amounts to separating  rea l 
and imaginary parts. Okay, so let's, now, solve this. Since that's our program, all we 
have to find is the solution. Well, just use integrating factors and just do it. So, the 
integrating factor w ill be, what, e to the, I don't want to use that formula. 

So, the integrating factor will be e^(kt) is the integrating factor. If I multiply through 
both sides by the integrating  factor, then the left-hand side w ill become y e to  the kt, 
the way it a lways does, prime, [y~ e^(kt)]', and the right-hand side will be, now I'm 
going to start comb ining exponentials. It w ill be k e^( i(omega t + k)). I'm going to 
write that k + omega t. 

i omega t + k. Thank you. i omega t plus k, or k + i omega t. kt? Sorry. So, it's k 
e^(i omega t) e^(kt). So, that's (k + i omega)t. Sorry. So, y~ e^(kt) is k divided 
by, now I integrate this, so it essentially reproduces itself, except you have to put 
down on the bottom k + i omega. 

I'll take the fina l step. What's y tilda equa ls, see, when you do it this way, then you 
don't get a messy looking formula that you substitute into and that is scary looking. 
This is never scary. Now, I'm going to do two things simultaneously. First of a ll, 
here, if I multiply, after I get the answer, I'm going to want to multiply it by e^(-kt), 
right, to solve for y tilda. 

If I multip ly this by e to the negative kt, then that just gets rid of the k that I put in, 
and left back with e to the i omega t. So, that side is easy. All that is left is e^( i 
omega t). Now, what's interesting is this thing out here, k + i omega. I'm going to 
take a typ ica l step of scaling it. And you sca le it. I'm going to divide the top and 
bottom by k. 

And, what does that produce? 1 / (1 +  i(omega  / k)). What I've done is take these 
two separate constants, and shown that the critical thing is their ratio. Okay, now, 
what I have to do now is take the real part. Now, there are two ways to do this. 
There are two ways to do this. Both are instructive. So, there are two methods. I 
have a multip lication. The problem is, of course, that these two things are multiplied 
together. And, one of them is, essentially, in Cartesian form, and the other is, 
essentia lly, in polar form. You have to make a decision. 

Either go polar, it sounds like go postal, doesn't it, or worse, like a bear, savage, 
attack it savagely, which that's a very good, aggressive attitude to have when doing 
a problem, or we can go Cartesian. Going polar is a little faster, and I think it's 

what's done in the nodes. The notes to do both of these. They just do the first. On 
the other hand, they give you a  formula, which is the critica l thing that you w ill need 
to go Cartesian. I hope I can do both of them if we sort of hurry along. How do I go 
polar? To go polar, what you want to do is express this thing in polar form. 

Now, one of the things I d idn't emphasize enough, probab ly, when I talked to you 
about comp lex numbers last time is, so I will remind you, which saves my conscience 
and doesn't hurt yours, suppose you have a lpha as a comp lex number. See, this 
complex number is a  reciproca l. The good number is what's down below. 
Unfortunately, it's downsta irs. You should know, like you know the back of your 
hand, which nobody knows, one over a lpha. 

So that's the form. The number I'm interested in, that coefficient,  it is of the form 
one over a lpha. (1 / alpha)*alpha = 1. And, from that, it follows, first of all, if I take 
absolute va lues, if the absolute value of one over a lpha times the absolute value of 
this is equal to one, so, this is equa l to one over the absolute va lue of alpha. I think 
you all knew that. I'm a little less certa in you knew how to take care of the angles. 

How about the argument? Well, the argument of the ang le, in other words, the ang le 
of one over alpha p lus, because when you multiply, ang les add. Remember that. 
Plus, the angle associated with alpha has to be the ang le associated with one. But 
what's that? One is out here. What's the angle of one? Zero. Therefore,  the 
argument, the absolute value of this thing is want over the absolute va lue. That's 
easy. And, you should know that the argument of want over a lpha is equal to minus 
the argument of alpha. So, when you take reciprocal, the angle turns into its 
negative. Okay, I'm going to use that now, because my a im is to  turn this into polar 
form. So, let's do that someplace, I guess here. 

So, I want the polar form for 1 / (1 + i(omega / k)). Okay, I w ill draw a p icture. 
Here's one. Here is (omega / k). Let's ca ll this angle phi. It's a natural thing to ca ll it. 
It's a right triangle, of course. Okay, now, this is going to be a comp lex number 
times e to an angle. Now, what's the ang le going to be? Well, this is a comp lex 
number, the ang le for the comp lex number. So,  the argument of the comp lex 
number, 1 + i(omega / k) is how much? Well, there's the complex number one plus i 
over (1 + i) / (1 + i(omega / k)). Its ang le is phi. So, the argument of this is phi, 
and therefore, the argument of its reciprocal is negative phi 

So, it's e^(-i phi). And, what's A? A is one over the absolute value of that complex 
number. Well, the absolute value of this complex number is 1 + (omega/k)^2. So, 
the A = 1 / sqrt(1 + (omega / k)^2) * e^(-i phi). 

See, I did  that. That's a critica l step. You must turn that coefficient. If you want to 
go polar, you must turn is that coefficient, write that coefficient in the polar form. 
And for that, you need these basic facts about, draw the comp lex number, draw its 
angle, and so on and so  forth. And now, what's there for the solution? Once you've 
done that, the work is over. What's the comp lex solution? The comp lex solution is 
this. I've just found the polar form for this. So, I multiply it by e^( i omega t), which 
means these things add. So, it's equal to A e^(i omega t - i phi). 

Or, in other words, the coefficient is 1 / sqrt(1 + (omega / k)^2). And, this is e to 
the, see if I get  it right, now. And finally, now, what's the answer to our rea l 
problem? y1: the real answer. I mean: the really real answer. What is it? Well, this is 
a rea l number. So, I simp ly reproduce that as the coefficient out front. And for the 

other part, I want the real part of that. But you can write that down  instantly. So, 
let's recopy the coefficient. And then, I want just the real part of this. Well, this is e 
to the i times some crazy ang le. 

So, the rea l part is the cosine of that crazy angle. So, it's the cos(omega t - phi). 
And, if somebody says, yeah, well, okay, I got the omega k, I know what that is. 
That came from the problem, the driving  frequency, driving angular frequency. That 
was omega, and k, I guess, k was the conductivity, the thing which told you how 
quickly the heat that penetrated the walls of the little inner chamber. 

So, that's okay, but what's this phi? Well, the best way to get phi is just to draw that 
picture, but if you want a formula for phi, phi will be, well, I guess from the picture, 
it's phi = atan(omega / k), which I don't have to put in. So, it's this number, phi, in 
reference to this function. See, if the phi weren't there, this would be cos(omega t), 
and we all know what that looks like. The phi is called the phase lag or phase delay, 
something like that, the phase lag of the function. What does it represent? It 
represents, let me draw you a p icture. 

Let's draw the picture like this. Here's cos(omega t). Now, regular cosine would look 
sort of like that. But, I will indicate that the angular frequency is not one by making 
my cosine squinchy up a little too much. Everybody can tell that that's the cosine on 
a limp axis, something for Salvador Dali, okay. So, there's cosine of something. So, 
what was it? Blue? I don't have b lue. Yes, I have b lue. Okay, so now you will know 
what I'm talking about because this looks just  like the screen on your computer 
when you put in the visua l for this. Frequency: your response order one. So, this is 
cos(omega t). 

Now, how will cos(omega t - phi) look? Well, it'll be moved over. Let's, for example, 
suppose phi were pi over two. Now, where's pi over two on the picture? Well, what I 
do is cos(omega t) minus this. I move it over by one, so that this point becomes that 
one, and it looks like, the site w ill look like this. In other words, I shove  it over by, so 
this is the point where omega t = p i / 2. 

It's not the va lue of t. It's not the va lue of t. It's the value of omega t. And, when I 
do that, then the blue curve has been shoved over one quarter of its total cycle, and 
that turns  it, of course, into the sine curve, which I hope I can draw. So, this goes up 
to there, and then,  it's got to get back through. Let me stop there while I'm ahead. 
So, this  is sin(omega t), the yellow thing, but that's also, in another life, cos(omega t 
- pi/2). The ma in thing is you don't subtract, the pi over two is not being subtracted 
from the t. 

It's being subtracted from the whole expression, and this whole expression 
represents an ang le, which tells you where you are in the travel, a long cosine to 
this. What this quantity gets to be two pi, you're back where you started. That's not 
the d istance on the t axis. It's the angle through which you go  through. In other 
words, does number describes where you are on the cosine cycle. It doesn't tell you, 
it's not a iming at telling you exactly where you are on the t axis. The response 
function looks like 1/[sqrt(1 + (omega / k)^2)*cos(omega t - phi)]. 

And, I asked you on the problem set, if k goes up, in other words,  if the conductivity 
rises, if heat can get more rapidly from the outside to the inside, for example, how 
does that affect the amplitude? This is the amplitude, A, and the phase lag. In other 
words, how does this affect the response? And now, you can see. If k goes up, this 

fraction is becoming smaller. That means the denominator is becoming smaller, and 
therefore, the amp litude is going up. 

What's happening to the phase lag? Well, the phase lag looks like this: phi omega / 
k. If k is going up,  then the size of this side is going down, and the angle is going 
down. Now, that part is intuitive. I would have expected everybody to get that. It's 
the heat gets in quickly, more quickly, then the amplitude will match more quickly. 
This will rise, and get fairly close to one, in fact, and there should be very little lag in 
the way the response follows input. But how about the other one? Okay, I give you 
two minutes. The other one, you will figure out yourself.
