18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 1 

OK, let's get started. I'm assuming that, A, you went recitation yesterday, B, that 
even if you didn't, you know how to separate variab les, and you know how to 
construct simple models, solve physical problems w ith d ifferential equations, and 
possibly even solve them. So, you should have learned that either in high school, or 
18.01 here, or, yeah. So, I'm going to start from that point, assume you know that. 
I'm not going to tell you what differentia l equations are, or what modeling  is. If you 
still are uncertain about those things, the book has a very long and good exp lanation 
of it. Just read that stuff. So, we are talking about first order ODEs. 

ODE: I'll only use two acronyms. ODE  is ordinary d ifferential equations. I think all of 
MIT knows that, whether they've been taking the course or not. So, we are ta lking 
about first-order ODEs, which in standard form, are written, you isolate the 
derivative of y with respect to, x, let's say, on the left-hand side, and on the right-
hand side you write everything else. You can't always do this very well, but for 
today, I'm going to assume that it has been done and it's doable. So, for example, 
some of the ones that will be considered either today or in the problem set are things 
like y' = x / y. 

That's pretty simp le. The problem set has y' = x - y^2. And, it a lso has y' = y - x^2. 
There are others, too. Now, when you look at this, this, of course, you can solve by 
separating variables. So, this is solvable. This one is-- and neither of these can you 
separate variables. And they  look extremely similar. But they are extremely 
dissimilar. The most d issimilar about them is that this one is easily solvab le. And you 
will learn, if you don't know already, next time next Friday how to solve this one 

This one, which looks almost the same, is unsolvable in a certa in sense. Namely, 
there are no elementary functions which you can write down, which w ill g ive a 
solution of that d ifferential equation. So, right away, one confronts the most 
significant fact that even for the simplest possible d ifferential equations, those which 
only involve the first derivative, it's possible to write down extremely  looking simple 
guys. 

I'll put this one up in blue to indicate that it's bad. Whoops, sorry, I mean, not rea lly 
bad, but reca lcitrant. It's not solvable in the ordinary sense in which you think of an 
equation is solvab le. And, since those equations are the rule rather than the 
exception, I'm going about this first day to not solving a single differentia l equation, 
but ind icating to you what you do when you meet a blue equation like that. 

What do you do w ith it? So,  this first day is going to be devoted to geometric ways of 
looking at d ifferentia l equations and numerical. At the very end, I'll talk a little bit 
about numerical ways. And you'll work on both of those for the first problem set. So, 
what's our geometric view of differentia l equations? Well,  it's something that's 
contrasted w ith the usual procedures, by which you solve things and find elementary 
functions which solve them. I'll call that the analytic method. So, on the one hand, 

we have the analytic ideas, in which you write down explicitly the equation, y' = 
f(x,y). 

And, you look for certain functions, which are ca lled its solutions. Now, so there's the 
ODE. And, y1 of x, notice I don't use a separate  letter. I don't use g or h or 
something like that for the solution because the  letters multip ly so quickly, that is, 
multip ly in the sense of rabbits, that after a while, if you keep using different letters 
for each new idea, you can't figure out what you're talking about. 

So, I'll use y1 means, it's a solution of this d ifferential equation. Of course,  the 
differentia l equation has many solutions containing an arbitrary constant. So, we'll 
call this the solution. Now, the geometric view, the geometric guy that corresponds 
to this version of writing the equation, is something ca lled a direction  field. And, the 
solution is,  from the geometric point of view, something ca lled an integra l curve. So, 
let me expla in if you don't know what the direction field is. I know for some of you, 
I'm review ing what you learned in high school. Those of you who had the BC syllabus 
in high school should know these things. But, it never hurts to get a little more 
practice. And, in any event, I think the computer stuff that you will be doing on the 
problem set, a certain amount of it should be novel to you. 

It was novel to me, so why not to you? So, what's a d irection  field? Well, the 
direction field is, you take the p lane, and in each point of the plane-- of course, 
that's an impossibility. But, you pick some points of the p lane. You draw what's 
called a little line element. So, there is a point. It's a little line, and the only thing 
which distinguishes it outside of its position in the p lane, so here's the point, (x,y), at 
which we are draw ing this line element, is its slope. And, what is its slope? Its slope 
is to be f(x,y). And now, You fill up the plane w ith these things until you're tired of 
putting then in. So, I'm going to get tired pretty quickly. 

So, I don't know, let's not make them a ll go the same way. That sort of seems 
cheating. How about here? Here's a  few randomly chosen line elements that I put in, 
and I putted the slopes at random since I didn't have any particular differential 
equation in mind. Now, the integra l curve, so those are the line elements. The 
integral curve is a curve, which goes through the p lane, and at every point is tangent 
to the line element there. 

So, this  is the integral curve. Hey, wait a minute, I thought tangents were the line 
element there didn't even touch it. Well, I can't fill up the plane w ith line elements. 
Here, at this point, there was a line element, which I d idn't bother draw ing in. And, it 
was tangent to that. Same thing over here: if I drew the line element here, I would 
find that the curve had exactly the right slope there. 

So, the point is the integral, what d istinguishes the integral curve  is that everywhere 
it has the d irection, that's the way I'll  indicate that it's tangent, has the direction of 
the field everywhere at all points on the curve, of course, where it doesn't go. It 
doesn't have any mission to  fulfill. Now, I say that this integra l curve is the graph of 
the solution to the differentia l equation. In other words, writing down ana lytically the 
differentia l equation is the same geometrica lly as draw ing this d irection  field, and 
solving analytically for a solution of the d ifferential equation is the same thing as 
geometrically drawing an integral curve. So, what am I saying? 

I say that an  integral curve, a ll right, let me write it this way. I'll make a little 
theorem out of it, that y1(x) is a solution to the differentia l equation if, and only if, 

the graph,  the curve associated w ith this, the graph of y1 of x is an integral curve. 
Integral curve of what? Well, of the d irection  field associated w ith that equation. But 
there isn't quite enough room to write that on the board. But, you could put  it in 
your notes,  if you take notes. So, this is the relation between the two, the integral 
curves of the graphs or solutions. 

Now, why  is that so? Well, in fact, all I have to do to prove this,  if you can ca ll it a 
proof at all, is simply to translate what each side rea lly means. What does it really 
mean to say that a g iven  function is a solution to the d ifferentia l equation? Well, it 
means that if you plug it into the differentia l equation, it satisfies it. Okay, what is 
that? So, how do I plug it into the differentia l equation and check that it satisfies it? 

Well, doing it in the abstract, I first calculate its derivative. And then, how w ill it look 
after I plugged it  into the d ifferential equation? Well, I don't do anything to the x, but 
wherever I see y, I plug in this particular function. So, in notation, that would be 
written this way. So, for this to be a solution means this, that that equation is 
satisfied. Okay, what does it mean for the graph to be an integra l curve? Well, it 
means that at each point, the slope of this curve, it means that the slope of y1 of x 
should be, at each point, (x1,y1). It should be equal to the slope of the direction field 
at that point. 

And then, what is the slope of the d irection field at that point? Well,  it is f of that 
particular, well, at the point, (x,y1). If you like, you can put a subscript, one, on 
there, send a one here or a zero there, to indicate that you mean a particular point. 
But,  it looks better if you don't. But, there's some possibility of confusion. I admit to 
that. So, the slope of the d irection field, what is that slope? Well, by the way, I 
calculated the direction field. Its slope at the point was to be x, whatever the value 
of x was, and whatever the value of y1(x) was, substituted into the right-hand side 
of the equation. So, what the slope of this function of that curve of the graph should 
be equal to the slope of the direction field. Now, what does this say? 

Well, what's the slope of y1(x)? That's y1'(x). That's from the first day of 18.01, 
calculus. What's the slope of the direction field? This? Well, it's this. And, that's with 
the right hand side. So, saying these two guys are the same or equal, is exactly, 
analytically, the same as saying these two guys are equa l. So, in other words, the 
proof consists of, what does this rea lly mean? What does this really mean? And after 
you see what both really mean, you say, yeah, they're the same. 

So, I don't how to write that. It's okay: same, same, how's that? This is the same as 
that. Okay, well, this  leaves us the  interesting question of how do you draw a 
direction from the, well, this being 2003, mostly computers draw them  for you. 
Nonetheless, you do have to know a certain amount. I've given you a couple of 
exercises where you have to draw the d irection  field yourself. This is so you get a 
feeling for it, and a lso because humans don't draw direction fields the same way 
computers do. So, let's first of a ll, how d id computers do it? They are very stup id. 
There's no prob lem. 

Since they go very fast and have unlimited amounts of energy to waste, the 
computer method is the naive one. You pick the point. You p ick a point, and 
generally, they are usually equally spaced. You determine some spacing, that one: 
blah, blah, b lah, blah, b lah, blah, b lah, equa lly spaced. And, at each point, it 
computes f(x, y) at the po int, finds, meets, and computes the va lue of f of (x, y), 
that function, and the next thing is, on the screen, it draws, at (x, y), the  little line 

element having slope f(x, y). In other words, it does what the d ifferential equation 
tells it to do. 

And the only thing that  it does is you can, if you are telling the thing to draw the 
direction field, about the only option you have is telling what the spacing should be, 
and sometimes people don't like to see a whole line. They only like to see a little bit 
of a half line. And, you can sometimes tell, according to the program, tell the 
computer how long you want that line to be, if you want it teeny or a little bigger. 
Once in awhile you want you want it narrower on it, but not right now. 

Okay, that's what a computer does. What does a human do? This is what it means to 
be human. You use your intelligence. From a human point of view, this stuff has 
been done in the wrong order. And the reason it's been done in the wrong order: 
because for each new point,  it requires a recalculation of f(x, y). That is horrible. The 
computer doesn't mind, but a human does. So, for a human, the way to do it is not 
to beg in by picking the point, but to begin by picking the slope that you would like to 
see. So, you beg in by taking the slope. Let's ca ll it the value of the slope, C. So, you 
pick a number. C is two. I want to see where are a ll the points in the plane where 
the slope of that line element would be two? Well, they will satisfy an equation. 

The equation is f(x,y) = C, in general. So, what you do is plot this, plot the equation, 
plot this equation. Notice, it's not the differential equation. You can't exactly plot a 
differentia l equation. It's a curve, an ord inary curve. But which curve will depend; 
it's, in  fact, from the 18.02 point of view, the level curve of C, sorry, it's a level curve 
of f of (x, y), the function f of x and y corresponding to the level of value C 

But we are not going to ca ll it that because this is not 18.02. Instead, we're going to 
call it an isocline. And then, you plot, well, you've done it. So, you've got this 
isocline, except I'm going to use a solution curve, solid  lines, only for integra l curves. 
When we do plot isoclines, to ind icate that they are not solutions, we'll use dashed 
lines for doing them. One of the computer things does and the other one doesn't. But 
they use d ifferent colors, also. There are different ways of telling you what's an 
isocline and what's the solution curve. So, and what do you do? So, these are all the 
points where the slope is going to be C. 

And now, what you do is draw in as many as you want of  line elements having slope 
C. Notice how efficient that is. If you want 50 million of them and have the time, 
draw in 50 million. If two or three are enough, draw in two or three. You w ill be 
looking at the p icture. You will see what the curve  looks  like, and that w ill g ive you 
your judgment as to how you are to do that. So, in general, a picture drawn that 
way, so let's say, an isocline corresponding to C equa ls zero. 

The line elements, and I think for an isocline, for the purposes of this lecture, it 
would be a good idea to put isoclines. Okay, so I'm going to put solution curves in 
pink, or whatever this color is, and isoclines are going to be in orange, I guess. So, 
isocline, represented by a dashed line, and now you will put in the line elements of, 
we'll need lots of cha lk for that. So, I'll use white chalk. 

Y horizonta l? Because according to this the slope is supposed to be zero there. And 
at the same way, how about an isocline where the slope is negative one? Let's 
suppose here C is equal to negative one. Okay, then it w ill  look like this. These are 
supposed to be lines of slope negative one. Don't shoot me if they are not. So, that's 

the principle. So, this is how you w ill fill up the plane to draw a direction field: by 
plotting the  isoclines first. 

And then, once you have the isoclines there, you w ill have line elements. And you 
can draw a direction field. Okay, so, for the next few minutes, I'd like to work a 
coup le of examples for you to show how this works out in practice. So,  the first 
equation is going to be y' = -x / y. Okay,  first thing, what are the isoclines? Well, the 
isoclines are going to be y. 

Well, -x / y = C. Maybe I better make two steps out of this. Minus x over y is equal 
to C. But, of course, nobody draws a curve in that form. You'll want it  in the form y 
= -1 / C * x. So, there's our isocline. Why don't I put that up in orange since it's 
going to be, that's the color I'll draw it in. In other words,  for d ifferent va lues of C, 
now this thing is aligned. It's a ligned, in fact, through the orig in. This looks pretty 
simple. Okay, so here's our plane. The isoclines are going to be lines through the 
orig in. And now, let's put them in, suppose, for example, C is equal to one. 

Well, if C  is equa l to one, then it's the line, y equals minus x. So, this is the isocline. 
I'll put, down here, C equals minus one. And, a long it, no, something's wrong. I'm 
sorry? C is one, not negative one, right, thanks. Thanks. So, C equals one. So, it 
should be little line segments of slope one will be the line elements,  things of slope 
one. OK, now how about C equa ls negative one? 

If C equals negative one, then it's the  line, y = x. And so, that's the isocline. Notice, 
still dash because these are isoclines. Here, C is negative one. And so, the slope 
elements look like this. Notice, they are perpend icular. Now, notice that they are 
always going to be perpendicular to the line because the slope of this line is minus 
one over C. But, the slope of the line element is going to be C. Those numbers, 
minus one over C and C, are negative reciprocals. And, you know  that two lines 
whose slopes are negative reciproca ls are perpendicular. So, the line elements are 
going to be perpendicular to these. And therefore, I hardly even have to bother 
calculating, doing any more calculation. Here's going to be a, well, how about this 
one? 

Here's a controversia l isocline. Is that an isocline? Well, wait a minute. That doesn't 
correspond to anything looking like this. Ah-ha, but it would if I put C multiplied 
through by C. And then, it would correspond to C being zero. In other words, don't 
write it like this. Multip ly through by C. It will read C y = - x. And then, when C is 
zero, I have x equals zero, which is exactly the y-axis. 

So, that really is included. How about the x-axis? Well, the x-axis is not included. 
However, most peop le include it anyway. This is very common to be a sort of sloppy 
and bend ing the edges of corners a little bit, and hop ing nobody will notice. We'll say 
that corresponds to C equa ls infinity. I hope nobody wants to  fight about that. If you 
do, go  fight w ith somebody else. So, if C is infinity, that means the little line segment 
should have infinite slope, and by common consent, that means it should be vertical. 
And so, we can even count this as sort of an isocline. And, I'll make the dashes 
sma ller, ind icate it has a lower status than the others. And, I'll put this in, do  this 
weaselly thing of putting it in quotation marks to indicate that I'm not responsib le for 
it. 

Okay, now, we now have to put it the integra l curves. Well, nothing could be easier. 
I'm looking  for curves which are everywhere perpend icular to these rays. Well, you 

know  from geometry that those are circles. So,  the integral curves are circles. And, 
it's an elementary exercise, which I would not deprive you of the pleasure of. Solve 
the ODE by separation of variab les. In other words, we've gotten the, so the circles 
are ones w ith a center at the origin, of course, equal some constant. I'll ca ll it C1, so 
it's not confused with this C. They  look like that, and now you should solve this by 
separating variables, and just confirm that the solutions are, in fact, those circles. 

One interesting thing, and so I confirm this, I won't do it because I want to do 
geometric and numerica l things today. So, if you solve it by separating variab les, 
one  interesting thing to note is that if I write the solution as y = y1(x), well, it'll look 
something like the sqrt (C1 - x^2). We'll make the x squared because that's the way 
people usua lly put the radius. 

And so, a solution, a typical solution looks like this. Well, what's the solution over 
here? Well, that one solution will be goes from here to here. If you like, it has a 
negative side to it. So, I'll make, let's say, plus. There's another solution, which has 
a negative va lue. But let's use the one with the positive value of the square root. My 
point  is this, that that solution, the doma in of that solution, really only goes from 
here to here. It's not the whole x-axis. It's just a limited p iece of the x-axis where 
that solution is defined. There's no way of extending it further. And, there's no way 
of pred icting, by looking at the differentia l equation, that a typ ical solution was going 
to have a limited domain like that. 

In other words, you could find a solution, but how far out is it going to go? 
Sometimes, it's impossib le to tell, except by either finding it explicitly, or by asking a 
computer to draw a picture of it, and seeing if that g ives you some insight. It's one 
of the many difficulties in handling differential equations. You don't know what the 
domain of a solution is going to be until you've actually ca lculated it. 

Now, a slightly more complicated example is going to be, let's see, y' = 1 + x - y. 
It's not a lot more comp licated, and as a computer exercise, you w ill work with, still, 
more complicated ones. But here, the isoclines would be what? Well, I set that equal 
to C. Can you do the a lgebra in your head? An isocline will have the equation: this 
equa ls C. So, I'm going to put the y on the right hand side, and that C on the left 
hand side. So, it w ill have the equation y = 1 + x - C, or a nicer way to write it would 
be y = x + 1 - C. I guess it really doesn't matter. 

So there's the equation of the isocline. Let's quickly draw the d irection  field. And 
notice, by the way, it's a simple equation, but you cannot separate variab les. So, I 
will not, today at any rate, be able to check the answer. I will not be able to get an 
analytic answer. All we'll be ab le to do now is get a geometric answer. But notice 
how quickly, relatively quickly, one can get it. So, I'm  feeling  for how the solutions 
behave to this equation. 

All right, let's see, what should we plot first? I like C equals one, no, don't do C 
equa ls one. Let's do C equals zero, first. C equals zero. That's the line. y = x + 1. 
Okay, let me run and get that cha lk. So, I'll isoclines are in orange. If so, when C 
equa ls zero, y equals x plus one. So, let's say it's this curve. C equals zero. How 
about C equals negative one? Then it's y = x + 2. It's this curve. Well,  let's label it 
down here. So, this is C equals negative one. C equa ls negative two would be y 
equa ls x, no, what am I doing? 

C equals negative one is y = x + 2. That's right. Well, how about the other side? If C 
equa ls plus one, well, then it's going to go through the origin. It looks like a little 
more room down here. How about, so if this is going to be C equa ls one, then I sort 
of get the idea. C equals two will look  like this. They're a ll going to be parallel lines 
because all that's changing is the y-intercept, as I do this thing. So, here, it's C 
equa ls two. That's probably enough. All right, let's put it in the line elements. All 
right, C equals negative one. These will be perpend icular. C equals zero, like this. 

C equals one. Oh, this is interesting. I can't even draw in the line elements because 
they seem to coincide w ith the curve itself, with the line itself. They write y along the 
line, and that makes it hard to draw them in. How about C equa ls two? Well, here, 
the line elements will be slanty. They'll have slope two, so a pretty slanty up. And, I 
can see if a C equals three in the same way. There are going to be even more 
slantier up. And here, they're going to be even more slanty down. This is not very 
scientific terminology or mathematical, but you get the  idea. Okay, so there's our 
quick version of the d irection  field. All we have to do is put in some integra l curves 
now. Well, it looks like it's doing this. It gets less slanty here. It levels out, has slope 
zero. 

And now, in this part of the plain, the slope seems to be rising. So, it must do 
something like that. This guy must do something like this. I'm a little doubtful of 
what I should be doing here. Or, how about going from the other side? Well, it rises, 
gets a little, should it cross this? What should I do? Well, there's one  integral curve, 
which is easy to see. It's this one. This line is both an isocline and an integra l curve. 

It's everything, except drawab le, [LAUGHTER] so, you understand this is the same 
line. It's both orange and pink at the same time. But I don't know what combination 
color that would make. It doesn't look like a line, but be sympathetic. Now, the 
question is, what's happening in this corridor? In the corridor, that's not a 
mathematica l word either, between the isoclines for, well, what are they? They are 
the isoclines for C equals two, and C equa ls zero. How does that corridor look? Well: 
something like this. Over here, the lines a ll look  like that. And here, they all look like 
this. 

The slope is two. And, a hap less solution gets  in there. What's it to do? Well, do you 
see that if a solution gets in that corridor, an integral curve gets in that corridor, no 
escape is possible. It's like a lobster trap. The lobster can wa lk in. But it cannot walk 
out because things are always going  in. How could it escape? Well, it would have to 
double back, somehow, and remember, to escape, it has to be, to escape on the left 
side, it must be going horizontally. 

But, how could it do that w ithout doubling back first and having the wrong slope? 
The slope of everything in this corridor is positive, and to double back and escape, it 
would at some point have to have negative slope. It can't do that. Well, could it 
escape on the right-hand side? No, because at the moment when it wants to cross, it 
will have to have a slope less than this line. But all these spiky guys are pointing; it 
can't escape that way either. So, no escape is possib le. It has to continue on, there. 
But, more than that is true. So, a solution can't escape. 

Once it's in there,  it can't escape. It's like, what do they call those p lants, I forget, 
pitcher p lants. All they hear is they are going down. So, it looks like that. And so, the 
poor little insect fa lls in. They could climb up the walls except that all the hairs are 
going the wrong direction, and it can't get over them. Well, let's think of it that way: 

this poor trap solution. So, it does what it has to do. Now, there's more to it than 
that. Because there are two principles involved here that you should know, that help 
a lot in drawing these pictures. Principle number one is that two integral curves 
cannot cross at an ang le. Two integral curves can't cross, I mean, by crossing at an 
angle like that. I'll ind icate what I mean by a p icture like that. 

Now, why not? This is an important principle. Let's put that up in the white box. They 
can't cross because if two integra l curves, are trying to cross, well, one w ill  look like 
this. It's an integral curve because  it has this slope. And, the other integral curve has 
this slope. And now, they fight with each other. What is the true slope at that point? 
Well, the direction field only a llows you to have one slope. If there's a line element at 
that point,  it has a definite slope. And therefore, it cannot have both the slope and 
that one. It's as simple as that. So, the reason is you can't have two slopes. The 
direction field doesn't a llow it. Well, that's a big, big help because if I know, here's 
an integral curve, and if I know that none of these other p ink integra l curves are 
allowed to cross it, how else can I do  it? 

Well, they can't escape. They can't cross. It's sort of clear that they must get closer 
and closer to it. You know, I'd have to work a little to justify that. But I think that 
nobody would have any doubt of it who d id a little experimentation. In other words, 
all these curves joined that little tube and get closer and closer to this line, y = x. 
And there, without solving the d ifferentia l equation, it's clear that a ll of these 
solutions, how do they behave? As x goes to infinity, they become asymptotic to, 
they become closer and closer to the solution, x. Is x a solution? Yeah, because y 
equa ls x is an integral curve. 

Is x a solution? Yeah, because if I plug in y equa ls x, I get what? On the right-hand 
side, I get one. And on the left-hand side, I get one. One equals one. So, this is a 
solution. Let's indicate that it's a solution. So, analytically, we've discovered an 
analytic solution to the d ifferential equation, namely, Y equals X, just by this 
geometric process. Now, there's one more principle like that, which is less obvious. 
But you do have to know it. So, you are not allowed to cross. That's clear. But it's 
much, much, much, much, much less obvious that two integra l curves cannot touch. 
That  is, they cannot even be tangent. Two integral curves cannot be tangent. 

I'll indicate that by the word touch, which is what a lot of peop le say. In other words, 
if this is  illega l, so is this. It can't happen. You know, without that, for example, it 
might be, I might feel that there would be nothing in this to prevent those curves 
from joining. Why couldn't these pink curves join the line, y equals x? You know, it's 
a solution. They just p itch a ride, as it were. The answer is they cannot do that 
because they have to just get asymptotic to it, ever, ever closer. They can't join y 
equa ls x because at the point where they join, you have that situation. 

Now, why can't you to have this? That's much more sophisticated than this, and the 
reason is because of something ca lled the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem, which 
says that there is through a point, (x0, y0), that y prime equa ls y' = f(x, y) has only 
one, and only one solution. One has one solution. In mathematics speak, that means 
at least one solution. It doesn't mean it has just one solution. That's mathematica l 
convention. It has one solution, at  least one solution. But, the killer is, only one 
solution. 

That's what you have to say in mathematics if you want just one, one, and only one 
solution through the point (x0, y0). So, the fact that it has one, that is the existence 

part. The fact that it has only one is the uniqueness part of the theorem. Now, like all 
good mathematica l theorems, this one does have hypotheses. So, this is not going to 
be a course, I warn you, those of you who are theoretically inclined, very rich in 
hypotheses. But, hypotheses for those one or that f(x, y) should be a continuous 
function. Now, like polynomial, signs, should be continuous near, in the vicinity of 
that point. 

That guarantees existence, and what guarantees uniqueness is the hypothesis that 
you would not guess by yourself. Neither would  I. What guarantees the uniqueness is 
that also,  it's partia l derivative with respect to y should be continuous, should be 
continuous near (x0, y0). Well, I have to make a decision. I don't have time to ta lk 
about Euler's method. I'll refer you to  the, there's one page of notes, and  I couldn't 
do any more than just repeat what's on those notes. So, I'll trust you to read that. 

And instead, let me g ive you an example which will solidify these things in your mind 
a little b it. I think that's a better course. The example is not in your notes, and 
therefore, remember, you heard it here first. Okay, so what's the example? So, there 
is that differential equation. Now, let's just solve it by separating variab les. Can you 
do it in your head? dy over dx, put a ll the y's on the left. It will look like dy / (1 - y). 
Put all the dx's on the left. So, the dx here goes on the right, rather. That w ill be dx. 
And then, the x goes down into the denominator. So now, it looks like that. 

And, if I integrate both sides, I get the log of one minus y, I guess, maybe w ith a, I 
never bothered w ith that, but you can. It should be absolute va lues. All right, put an 
absolute va lue, plus a constant. And now, if I exponentiate both sides, the constant 
is positive. So, this is going to look like y. (1 - y) = x. And, the constant will be 
e^C1. And, I'll just make that a new constant, Cx. And now, by letting C be 
negative, that's why you can get rid of the absolute values, if you allow C to have 
negative values as well as positive values. Let's write this in a more human form. So, 
y = 1 - Cx. Good, all right, let's just plot those. So, these are the solutions. 

It's a pretty easy equation, pretty easy solution method, just separation of variables. 
What do they look like? Well,  these are a ll lines whose intercept is at one. And, they 
have any slope whatsoever. So, these are the lines that look like that. Okay, now let 
me ask, existence and uniqueness. Existence: through which points of the plane 
does the solution go? Answer: through every point of the p lane, through any point 
here, I can find one and only one of those lines, except for these stupid guys here on 
the sta lk of the flower. Here, for each of these points, there is no existence. There is 
no solution to this d ifferentia l equation, which goes through any of these wigg ly 
points on the y-axis, with one exception. 

This point is oversupp lied. At this point, it's not existence that fails. It's uniqueness 
that fails: no uniqueness. There are lots of things which go through here. Now, is 
that a violation of the existence and uniqueness theorem? It cannot be a violation 
because the theorem has no exceptions. Otherw ise, it wouldn't be a theorem. So, 
let's take a look. What's wrong? We thought we solved it modulo, putting the 
absolute va lue signs on the log. What's wrong? The answer: what's wrong is to use 
the theorem you must write the differentia l equation in standard form, in the green 
form I gave you. Let's write the differential equation the way we were supposed to. 
It says dy / dx = (1 - y) / x. 

And now, I see, the right-hand side is not continuous, in  fact, not even defined when 
x equa ls zero, when a long the y-axis. And therefore, the existence and uniqueness is 

not guaranteed along the line, x equa ls zero of the y-axis. And, in  fact, we see that it 
failed. Now, as a practical matter, it's the way existence and uniqueness fails in a ll 
ordinary life work w ith d ifferential equations is not through sophisticated examp les 
that mathematicians can construct. 

But normally, because f(x, y) will fa il to be defined somewhere, and those will be the 
bad points. Thanks.
