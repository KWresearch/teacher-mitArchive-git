18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 13 

The task for today is to find particular solutions. So, let me remind you where we've 
gotten to. We're ta lking about the second-order equation w ith constant coefficients, 
which you can think of as modeling springs, or simple electrical circuits. But, what's 
different now is that the right-hand side is an input which is not zero. So, we are 
considering, I'm going to use x as your book does, keeping to a neutral letter. But, 
again, in the app lications, and in many of the applications at any rate, it wants to be 
t. But, I make it x. 

So, the independent variable is x, and the problem is, remember, that to  find a 
particular solution, and the reason why we want to do that is then the genera l 
solution will be of the form y equals that particular solution p lus the comp lementary 
solution, the genera l solution to the reduced equation, which we can write this way. 
So, all the work depends upon finding out what that yp is, and that's what we're 
going to ta lk about today, or rather, ta lk about for two weeks. But, the point is, not 
all functions that you could write on the right-hand side are equally  interesting. 
There's one kind, which is far more interesting, but more important in the 
applications than a ll the others. And, that's the one out of which, in fact, as you will 
see later on this week and into next week, an arbitrary function can be built out of 
these simp le functions. 

So, the important function is on the right-hand side to be able to solve it when it's a 
simple exponential. But, if you allow me to make it a comp lex exponential, so, here 
are the important right-hand sides where we want, we want to be ab le to do it when 
it's of the form, e^(ax). In general, that will be, in most applications, a is not a 
grow ing exponential, but a decaying exponential. So, typ ically, a is negative. But, it 
doesn't have to be. I'll put it in parentheses, though, often. That's not any 
assumption that I'm going to make today. It's just culture. But, we want to be ab le 
to do it for sin(omega x) and cos(omega x). 

In other words, when the right-hand side is a pure oscillation, that's another 
important type of input both for electrica l circuits, think a lternating current, or the 
spring systems. That's a pure vibration is you're imposing pure vibration on the 
spring-mass-dashpot system, and you want to see how it responds to that. Or, you 
could put them together, and make these decaying oscillations. So, we could also 
have something like e^(ax) sin(omega x), or times cos(omega x). Now, the point is, 
all of these together are rea lly just special cases of one genera l thing, exponential, if 
you allow the exponent not to be a rea l number, but to be a complex number. 

So, they're a ll specia l cases of e^(alpha x), well, why don't we write it (a + i omega) 
x, right? If omega is zero, then I've got this case. If a  is zero, I got this case 
separating into its rea l and imaginary parts. And, if neither is zero, I have this case. 
But, I don't want to keep writing (a plus i omega) all the time. So, I'm going to write 
that simply as e^(a lpha x). And, you understand that a lpha is a complex number 
now. It doesn't look like a rea l number. Okay, so the complex number. So, the 
equation we are solving is which one? This pretty purp le equation. And, we are trying 

to find a particular solution of  it. And, the specia l functions we are going to use are 
these, well, this one in particular, e^(a lpha x). 

That's going to be our input. Now, it turns out this  is amaz ing ly easy to do because 
it's an exponential because I write it in exponential form. The idea is simply to use a 
rule which, in fact, you know already, the rule of substitution. So, I'm going to write 
the equation in the form, so, there it is. It's y'' + Ay' + By =  f(x). But, I'm going to 
think of the left-hand side as the polynomia l operator, AD p lus B. 

A and B are constants, app lied to y =  f(x). That's the way I write the thing. And, this 
part, I'm going to think of in the form. This is p of D, a polynomia l in D. In  fact, it's a 
simple quadratic polynomial. But, most of what I'm going to say today would apply 
equa lly well if we were a higher order polynomia l, a polynomial of higher degree. 
And, just to reinforce the idea, I've given you one prob lem in your problem set when 
p is a polynomial of higher degree. I should say, the notes are written for genera l 
polynomials, not just for quadratic ones. I'm simplifying it by leaving it, today, I'll do 
what's in the notes, but I'll do it in the quadratic case to save a little time, and 
because that's the one you w ill be most concerned with in the problems. 

All right, so p(D) y =  f(x). And now, there are just a couple of basic formulas that 
we're going to use all the time. The first is that if you app ly p(D) to a complex 
exponentia l, or a  rea l one, it doesn't matter, the answer is you get just what you 
started with, with D substituted by alpha. So, it's p of alpha. In other words, put an 
alpha wherever you saw a D in the polynomial. 

And, what  is this? Well, this is now just an ord inary complex number, and multiply 
that by what you started w ith, e^(a lpha x). So,  that's a basic formula. It's called in 
the notes the substitution rule because the heart of it  is, you substitute for the D, 
you substitute a lpha. Now,  this hardly requires proof. But, let's prove it just so you 
see,  to reinforce things and make things go a little more slowly to make sure you are 
on board all the time. How would I prove that? Well, just calculate it out, what in  fact 
is D^2 + AD + B)e^(a lpha x). Well, it's D^2*e^(alpha x) + AD*e^(a lpha x) + 
B*e^(alpha x). 

Well, what are these? What's the derivative of e^(alpha x)? It's just a lpha e^(alpha 
x). What's a second derivative? Well,  if you remember from the exam, you can do 
tenth derivatives now. So, the second derivative is easy. It's alpha^2 e^(alpha x). In 
other words, this law, what I'm saying  really is that this law is obviously, quote 
unquote, "true". 

Okay, I'm not even going to put it in quotes. It's obviously true for the operator, D, 
and the operator D^2. In other words, D(e^(alpha x)) = alpha*e^(alpha x). 
D^2(e^(alpha x)) = alpha^2*e^(alpha x). And, therefore, it's true for linear 
combinations of these as well by linearity. So, therefore, a lso true for p(D). And, in 
fact, so if you calculate it out, what is  it? This is alpha^2 e^(alpha x) + a lpha 
e^(alpha x) times the coefficient p lus b e^(alpha x). 

So, it's in fact exactly this. It's e^(a lpha x) (alpha^2 + A a lpha + B). Now, how are 
we going to use this? Well, the idea  is very simp le. Remember, we're trying to solve 
this, I should have some consistent notation for these equations. Purp le, I think, w ill 
be the right thing here. You are solving purple equations. The formulas which will 
solve them w ill be orange formulas, and we will see what we need as we go along. 
So, I would like to just formulate it, this solution, the particular solution now. I'm 

going to call it a theorem. It's rea lly too simple to be a theorem. On the other hand, 
it's too important not to be a theorem. 

So, let's ca ll it, as I called it in the notes, the exponential input theorem, which says 
it all. Theorem says it's important. Exponential input means it's taking f(x) to be an 
exponentia l. It's an exponential  input, and the theorem tells you what the response 
is. So, for that equation, I'm not going to recopy the equation for the purple 
equation, adequately ind icated this way. There. Now try to take notes. For the purple 
equation, a solution is e^(alpha x). 

Somewhere I neglected to say that f(x) = e^(a lpha x), how about that? That 
equation, y'' + ay' + by = e^(alpha x). So, here's the exponential input. The solution 
is e^(alpha x) / p(alpha). Now, that's a very useful formula. In fact, Haynes Miller, 
who a lso teaches this course, in his notes calls of the most  important theorem in the 
course. Well, I don't have to tota lly agree w ith him, but  it's certa inly important. It's 
probably the most important theorem  for these two weeks, anyway. But, you w ill 
have others as well. Okay, so that's a theorem. The theorem  is going green. You can 
tell what they are by their color code. 

Well, in other words, what I've done is simply write down the solution for you, write 
down the particular solution. But let's verify it in genera l. So, the proof would be 
what? Well, I have to substitute it into the equation. So, the equation is p of D 
applied to y is equal to a lpha x. And, I want to know, when I substitute that 
expression in, is it the case that when I p lug it in, that the right-hand side, I 
calculate it out, apply p(D) to it. Is it the case that I get e^(alpha x) on the right? 
Well, all you have to do is do it. What is p(D) e^(alpha x) / (p(x))? 

Well, p(D) e^(alpha x) = p(a lpha) e^(alpha x). That's the substitution rule. What 
about this guy? This guy is a constant, so it just gets dragged a long because this 
operator is linear. If this applied to that is this, then if I apply it to one ha lf that, I 
get one ha lf the answer, and so on. So, the p(alpha) is a constant and just gets 
dragged a long. And now, they cancel each other, and the answer is, indeed, 
e^(alpha x). 

That's not much of a proof. I hope that to at least ha lf this class, you're wondering, 
yes, but what if Peter had not caught the wolf? I mean, what if? What if? I'm  looking 
stern. Okay, we w ill take care of it in the simp lest possible way. We will assume that 
p of a lpha is not zero. The case p(alpha) = 0 is,  in fact, an extremely important case, 
one that makes the world go 'round, one that contributes to a ll sorts of catastrophes, 
and they occur first here in the solution of differential equations, and that's what 
controls all the catastrophes. 

But,  there's a good side to it, too. It also makes a lot of good things happen. So, 
there are no moral judgments in mathematics. For the time being,  let's assume p of 
alpha is not zero. And,  that proof is okay because the p of alpha, being in the 
denominator, it's okay to be in the denominator if you're not zero. Okay, let's work 
in a simple example. Well, I'm p icking the most complicated example I can think of. 

Simp le examp les, I'll leave for your practice and for the recitations, can start off w ith 
simple examples  if you are confused by this. But, let's solve an equation,  find a 
particular solution. So, y'' - y' + 2y = 10 e^(-x) sin(x). Gulp. Okay, so, the input is 
this function, 10 e^(-x), it's a decaying oscillation. You're seeing those already on 
the computer screen if you started your homework, if you've done problem one on 

your homework. It's a decaying exponentia l, and I want to find a particular solution. 
Well, let's find a particular and the genera l solution. F ind the general solution. 

Well, the ma in part of the work is find ing the particular solution, but let's quickly, the 
general solution, let's find first the complementary part of it,  in other words, the 
solution to the homogeneous equation. That's D^2 - D + 2. No, let's not. I don't 
want to solve messy quadratics. Okay, we're going to find a particular solution. I 
thought it was going to come out easy, and then I rea lized it wasn't because I picked 
the wrong signs. Okay, so if you don't like, just change the prob lem. I can do that, 
but you cannot. Don't forget that. So, we want a particular solution  in our equation. 
It is this equa ls that. Now, let's complexify it to make this part of a complex 
exponentia l. 

So, the comp lex exponential that's relevant is 10 e^((-1 + i)x). What is this? This is 
the imag inary part of this complex exponentia l. So, this  is imaginary part of that 
guy, e^(-x)*e^( ix), and the imag inary part of e^(ix) is sin(x). The ten, of course, 
just comes a long for the ride. Okay, well, now, since this is a comp lex equation, I 
shouldn't ca ll this y anymore by my notation. I like to ca ll it y tilde to ind icate that 
the solution we get to this is not going to be the orig inal solution to the original 
problem, but you will have to take the imaginary part of it to get it. 

So, we are looking, now,  for the comp lex solution to this comp lexified equation. 
Okay, what is it? Well,  the complex particular solution I can write down immediately. 
It is ten, that, of course, just gets dragged along by linearity, 10 e^((-1 + i)x). And, 
it's over this polynomia l evaluated at this alpha. So, just write it down with, have 
faith. So, what do I get? The alpha is -1 + i. I. square that, because I'm substituting 
this alpha into  that polynomial. The reason I'm doing that is because the formula 
tells me to do it. That's going to be that solution. Okay, so it's (-1 + i)^2 - (-1 + i) + 
2. All I've done is substitute -1 + i for D in that polynomial, the quadratic 
polynomial. 

And now, all I want is the imag inary part of this. The  imag inary part of this will be 
the solution to the orig inal prob lem because this was the right hand side with the 
imaginary part of the complexified  right hand side. Okay, now, let's make it look a 
little better, yp tilde. Clearly, what we have to do something nice to the 
denominator. So, I'll copy the numerator. That's e^((-1 + i)x), and how about the 
denominator? Well, aga in, don't expand things out because it's already this long. 
And, what's the point of making it this long? You want to make it as long, right? 
Okay, then there is room here for one rea l number, and another real number times i, 
there's no more room. Okay, what's the real number? 

Okay, we're looking for the real part of this expression. So, just put it in and keep it 
menta lly. So, minus one squared: that's one, p lus i squared, that's minus one. One 
minus one  is zero. I can forget about that term. The term gives me plus one for the 
real part, plus two. The answer is that the real part is three. How about the 
imaginary part? Well,  from here, there's negative 2i, negative 2i. 

I'm expanding that out by the b inomia l theorem, or whatever you like to ca ll that, -2i 
- i = -3i. Is that right? M inus 2i, minus i, minus 3i. So, it is ten thirds, and now in the 
denominator I have one minus i. I'll put that in the numerator, make it one p lus i, 
but I have to d ivide by the product of one minus i and its comp lex conjugate. In 
other words, I'm multiplying both top and bottom by one plus i. And so,  that makes 

here one squared plus one squared is two. And now, what's left is e^(-x)cos(x) + i 
sin(x). 

Now, of that, what we want is just the imaginary part. Well, let's see. Two goes into 
ten makes five, so that's five thirds. So, we're practica lly at our solution. The 
solution, then, fina lly, is going to be yp  is the  imaginary part of yp tilde. And, what's 
that? Well, what's the coefficient out front, first of all? It's five thirds, so let's pull out 
to five thirds before we forget it. And, we'll pull out the e to the negative x before we 
forget that. And then, the rest is simply a question of seeing what's left. Well, it's 
one. I want the imag inary part. So, the imaginary part is going to be one times 
cos(x), and then the other imaginary part comes from these two p ieces, which is one 
times sin(x). 

And, that should be the particular solution. Notice that most of the work is not 
getting this thing. It's turning it into something human that you can take the rea l 
and imaginary parts of. If we don't like this form, you can put it in the other form, 
which many engineers would do a lmost automatica lly, make  it five thirds, e to  the 
negative x, and what w ill that be? Well, you can use the genera l formula if you want. 
Remember, cosine,  the two coefficients are one and one, so it's one and one. So, this 
is the square root of two. So, it is times, this part makes the square root of two 
times cosine of x minus p i over the ang le. 

This is a phi. So, that's p i over four, minus p i over four. Okay, all right, now let's 
address the case which is going to occupy a  lot of the rest of today, and in a certain 
sense, a ll of next time. What happens when p(alpha) = 0? Well, in order to be able 
to handle this decently, it's necessary to have one more formula, which is very 
slightly more complicated than the substitution rule. 

But,  it's the same kind of rule. I'm going to call this, or it is ca lled the exponentia l. 
So, I'm going  to first prove a  formula, which is the ana log of that, and then I will 
prove a green formula, which is what to do here if p(a lpha) = 0. But, in order to be 
able to prove that, we're going to be the analog of the orange formula. And,  the 
analogue of the orange formula, that tells you how to app ly p(D) to a simp le 
exponentia l. 

I need a formula which applies p(D) to that simple exponential times another 
function. Now, I found I got into trouble by continuing to ca ll that alpha. So, I'm now 
going to change the name of alpha to change alpha's name to a. But, it's still 
complex. I don't mean it's guaranteed to be complex. I mean it's a llowed to be 
complex. So, a is now allowed to be a comp lex number. I'm thinking of it, in general, 
as a complex number, okay? I hope this doesn't upset you too much, but you know, 
you change x to t's, and y's to x's. This is no worse. All right, what we going to do? 
Well, I'm going to use this exponential shift rule, I'll call it, exponential shift rule or 
formula or law. 

That's the substitution rule for me. So, this is going to be exponentia l shift law. And, 
to app ly, it tells you how to apply the polynomia l to not D, not just the exponential, 
but the exponential times some function of x. What's that? And now, the rule is very 
simple. See, you can understand the difficulty. If you try to start differentiating, 
you're going to have to ca lculate second derivatives of the stuff, and God forbid, 
higher order equations. You would have to calculate fourth derivatives, fifth 
derivatives. You barely even want to calculate the first derivative. That's okay. But, 
second derivative, do I have to? No, not if you know the exponential shift rule, which 

says you can get rid of the e to the ax, make  it pass to the left of the operator where 
it's not  in any position to do any harm any longer, or upset the d ifferentiation. 

And, all you have to do is, when it passes over that operator, it changes D --> D + 
a. So, the answer is, e^(ax). There, it's passed over. But, when it d id so, it changed 
D to D plus a. And, what about the u? Well, the u just stayed there. Nothing 
happened to it. Okay, there's our orange formula. I guess we better put the thing 
around the whole business. Should I prove that, or the proof is quite easy. So, let's 
do it just again to give you a chance to try to see, now, if somebody gives you a 
formula like that, you first stare at it. You might try a coup le of specia l cases, try it 
on a  function and see if it works, but a lready, you probably don't want to do that. 

I mean, even if you took a function like x here, you'd have to do a certa in amount of 
differentiating, and some quadratic thing here. You'd ca lculate and calculate away for 
a little while, and then if you d id it correctly, the two would in fact turn out to be 
equa l. But, you would not necessarily feel any the wiser. A better procedure in trying 
to understand something like this is say, well, let's keep the u general. 

Suppose we make D simple. For examp le, well,  if D is a constant, of course there's 
nothing to happen because if this is just a constant, both sides of these are the 
same. This doesn't make any sense if p doesn't really have a D in  it. Well, what's the 
simplest polynomial which would have a D in it? Well, D itself. So, let's take a specia l 
case. p(D) = D, and check the formula in that case; see  if it works. 

So, the formula is asking us, what is D, D e^(ax) u? I'm not going to put in the 
variable here because it's just a waste of cha lk. Well, what is that? I know how to 
calculate that. I'll use the product rule. So, it's the derivative. I'll tell you what; let's 
do the other order first. So, it's e^(ax) Du + a e^(ax) u. 

Do you  follow that? This is the product rule. It's e to the ax times the derivative of u 
plus the derivative of e^(ax) Du + a e^(ax) u. Now, is that right? I want to make it 
look like that. Well, to make it look like that I should first factor e^(ax) out. And 
now, what's left? Well, if I factor e to the ax out, what's  left is Du plus au, which is 
exactly (D + a)u, Du + au. Well, hey, that's just what the formula said it should be. 
If you make e to the x pass over D, it changes D --> D + a. 

Okay, now here's the ma in thing  I want to show you. All right, now, well let's try, if 
this is true, also works out for D^2, then the formula is clearly true by linearity 
because an arbitrary p(D) is just a linear combination w ith constant coefficients of D, 
D squared, and that constant thing, which we agreed there was nothing  to prove 
about. Now, hack, you're a hack if you take D squared and start ca lculating the 
second derivative of this. 

Okay, it's question about hacks. I mean, it's just, you haven't learned the right thing 
to do. Okay, that w ill work, but it's not what you want to do. Instead, you bootstrap 
your way up. I have already a  formula telling me how to handle this. And, you can 
be anything. Look at this not as D squared all by itself. Calculate, instead, D^2 
(e^(ax) u). Think of that as D(D(e^(ax) u)). In other words, we will do it one step at 
a time. But you see now immed iately the advantage of this. What's D(e^(ax) u)? 
Well, I just calculated that. Now, don't go back to the beginning. Don't go back to 
here. Use the formula. 

After all, you worked to calculate it, or I did. So, it's D of, and what's this inside? It's 
e^(ax) (D + a) u. Well, that looks like a mess, but it isn't because I'm taking D of e 
to the ax times something. And I already know how to take D of e to the ax times 
something. It doesn't matter what that something is. Here, the something was u. 
Here, the something is D plus (a times u) operating on u. But, the principle is the 
same, and the answer is what? Well, to take D of e to  the ax times something, you 
pass the e to  the ax over the D. That changes D --> D + a. And, you apply that to 
the other guy, which is (D p lus a) applied to u. 

What's the answer? e^(ax) (D + a)^2 u. It's just what you would have gotten if you 
had taken e^x, pass it over, and then changed D --> D + a. Now, another 
advantage to doing it this way is you can see that this argument is going to 
generalize to D^3. In other words, you would continue on in the same way by the 
process of mathematica l, one word, mathematical, begins w ith an I, induction. By 
induction, you would prove the same formula for the nth derivative. If you don't 
know what mathematical induction is, shame on you. But it's okay. A lot of you will 
be ab le to go through life without ever having to learn what it is. 

And, the rest of you will be computer scientists. Okay, so that's the idea of this rule. 
Now, we can use it to calculate something. Let's see, I'm going to need green for 
this, I guess, for our better formula. The formula, now, that tells you what to do if 
p(alpha) = 0. So, we're trying to solve the equation, D^2 + AD, we are trying to find 
a particular solution, e^(ax), let's say. Remember, a is comp lex. a could be complex. 
It doesn't have to be real. 

But,  the prob lem is that p(a lpha) = 0. How do I get a particular solution? Well, I will 
write it down  for you. So, this is part of that exponential input theorem. I think that's 
the way it is in the notes. I gave a ll the cases together, but I thought pedagog ica lly 
it's probab ly a little better to do the simp lest case first, and then build up on the 
complexity. So, what's yp? The answer is yp = e^(ax), except now you have to 
multip ly it by x out front. Where have you done something like that before? Yes, 
don't tell me. I know you know. But, what should go in the denominator? Clearly not 
p(alpha). What goes in the denominator is the derivative. 

Okay, but what if p'(alpha) = 0? Couldn't that happen? Yes, it could happen. So, we 
better make cases. This case is, the case where this is okay corresponds to the case 
where we're going to assume that alpha is a simple root, is a simple root of the 
polynomial, p. I don't know what to call the variable, p of D is okay. A simple zero, in 
other words, it's not double. Well, suppose is double. One of the consequences you 
will see just in a second, if it's a simple zero,  that means this derivative is not going 
to be zero. That's automatic. Yeah, well, suppose it's not as simple. Well, suppose is 
a doub le root. How did a-- How did that get changed to, argh! 

[LAUGHTER] That's not an alpha. Oh, well, yes it is, obviously. Change! All of you, I 
want you to change. They should have something like in a search key where 147 
occurrences of a lpha have been changed to a with a stroke of a, just your thumb. 
They don't have that for the blackboard, unfortunately. Well, too bad, for the future. 
Correctable blackboards. Well, what if a is double root? It can't be more than a 
double root because you've only got a quadratic polynomial. Quadratic polynomials 
only have two roots. 

So, the worst that can happen is that both of them are a. All right, in that case the 
formula should be yp is equal to, you are now going to need x^2 e^(ax), and in the 

denominator what you are going to need is the second derivative of, eva luated at a. 
Now, you can guess the way this going to go on. For higher degree things, if you've 
got a triple root, you will need here x^3, and here, p ''' , except you're going to need 
a factorial there, too. 

So, don't worry about it. It's in the notes, but I'm not going to give you that for 
higher roots. I don't even know if I will give it to you for double root. Yes, I a lready 
did, so it's too late. It's too late. Okay, so we w ill make this two formulas according 
to whether a is a sing le or a double root. Okay, let's prove one of these, and all of 
that will be good enough for my conscience. Let's prove the first one. Mostly, it's an 
exercise in using the first exponentia l shift rule. Okay, this will be a first examp le 
actually seeing a work in practice as opposed to proving  it. 

Okay, so what does that thing look like? So, what does the polynomial look like, 
which has a as a simple root? So, we're going to try to prove the simple root case. 
So, I'm just going to calculate what those guys actually look like. What does p(D) 
look like if a is a simple root? Well, if it's a simple root, that means it has a  factor. 
When it factors, it factors into the product of (D minus a) times something which 
isn't, D minus some other root. And,  the point is that b is not equal to A. The roots 
are really distinct. Okay, what's, then, p', I'm going to have to ca lculate p'(a). What 
is that? 

Well, let's calculate p '(D) first. It is, well, by the ordinary product rule, it's the 
derivative of this times, which is one times (D minus a) plus, that's one thing p lus 
the same thing on the other side, the derivative of this, which is one times (D minus 
b). So, that's p prime. And therefore, what's p'(a)? It's nothing but, this part is zero, 
and that's a minus b. 

Of course, this  is not zero because it's a simple root. And, that's the proof for you if 
you want, that if the root is simp le, that p'(a) is guaranteed not to be zero. And, you 
can see, it's going to be zero exactly when b equals a, and that root occurs twice. 
But, I'm assuming that didn't happen. Okay, then all the rest we have to do is 
calculate, do the calculation. So, what I want to prove now is that w ith this p(D), 
what I'm trying to calculate that p(D) x e^(ax), except I'm going to write  it as 
e^(ax) x / p'(a). 

This is my proposed particular solution. So, what I have to do is ca lculate it, and see 
that it turns out to be, what do I hope it turns out to be? What the right hand side of 
the equation, the input? The input is e^(ax). If this  is true,  then yp, a particular 
solution,  indeed, nothing w ill be a particular solution. Of course, there could be 
others, but in this game, I only have to  find one particular solution, and that 
certainly by far is the simp le as one you could possib ly find. So, I have to ca lculate 
this. And now, you see why I did the exponentia l shift rule because this is begg ing to 
be d ifferentiated by something simpler than hack. 

Okay, you can also see why I violated the natural order of things and put the e^(ax) 
on the left in order that it pass over more easily. So, the answer on the left-hand 
side is e to the ax times p of (D plus a). Now, what is (p of D) plus a? Write it in this 
form. It's going to be a - b. So, p(D + a) is, change D --> D + a. So, the first factor 
is going to be D + a - b. And, what's the second factor? Change D --> D + a. It turns 
into D. All this is the result of taking that p(D), and chang ing D to D plus a. And now, 
this is to be applied to what? Well, e^(ax) is a lready passed over. So, what's left is 
x. 

And, that's to be d ivided by the constant, p'(a). Now, what does this all come out to 
be? e^(ax), what's D applied to x? One, right? And now, what's this thing applied to 
the constant one? Well, the D kills it, so it has no effect. It makes it zero. The rest 
just multiplies it by a - b. So, the answer to the top is (a minus b) times one. And, 
the answer to the bottom is p'(a), which I showed you by just explicit ca lculation is a 
minus b. And so the answer is, e^(ax) comes out right. 

Now, the other one, the other formula comes out the same way. I'll leave that as an 
exercise. Also, I don't dare do it because it's much too close to the problem I asked 
you to do for homework. So, let's by way of conclusion, I'll do one more simple 
example, okay? And then, you can  feel you understand something. I'm sort of 
bothered that I haven't done any examp les of this more comp licated case. So, I'll 
pick an easy version instead of the one that you have in your notes, which is the one 
you have for homework, which is even easier. 

So, this one's epsilon less easy. y'' - 3y' + 2y = e^x. Okay, notice that one is a 
simple root. The one I'm talking about is the a here, which is one. One is a simple 
root of the polynomia l D^2 - 3D + 2, isn't it? It's a zero. Put D equal one and you 
get 1 - 3 + 2 = 0. It's a simp le root because anybody can see that one is not a 
double root because you know  from critica l damping, if one were a double root, you 
know just what the polynomia l would  look like, and it wouldn't look like that at a ll. It 
would not look like D^2 - 3D + 2. It would look differently. Therefore, that proves 
that one is a simple root. Okay, what's the particular solution, therefore? 

The particular solution is x times e to the x divided by the derivative, the derivative 
eva luated at the point, so, what's p prime of D? It is 2D minus three. If I eva luate it 
at the point, one, it is negative one. So,  if this is to be d ivided by negative one, in 
other words, it's minus x e to the X. And, if you don't believe it, you could p lug it in 
and check it out. Okay, I'm letting you out one minute early. Remember that. I'm 
trying to pay off the accumulated debt.
