18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 17 

I'd like to ta lk. Thank you. One of the things I'd like to g ive a little  insight into today 
is the mathematica l basis for hearing. For example, if a musica l tone, a pure musical 
tone would consist of a pure oscillation in terms of the vibration of the air. It would 
be a pure oscillation. So, [SINGS], and  if you superimpose upon that, suppose you 
sing a triad, [SINGS], those are three tones. 

Each has its own period of oscillation, and then another one, which is the top one, 
which is even faster. The higher it is, the faster the thing. Anyway, what you hear, 
then, is the sum of those things. So, C p lus E p lus G, let's say, what you hear is the 
wave form. It's periodics, still, but it's a mess. I don't know, I can't draw it. So, this 
is periodic, but a mess, some sort of mess. Now, of course, if you hear the three 
tones together, most people, if they are not tone deaf, anyway, can hear the three 
tones that make up that. 

So, in other words, if this is the function which is the sum of those three, some sort 
of messy function,  f(t), you're ab le to do Fourier analysis on it, and break it up. 
You're able to take that f of t, and somehow mentally express it as the sum of three 
pure oscillations. That's Fourier analysis. We've been doing it with an infinite series, 
but it's okay. It's still Fourier ana lysis if you do it w ith just three. 

So, in other words, the f(t) is going to be the sum of, let's say, sine, I don't know, 
it's going to be the sign of one frequency plus the sine of another frequency p lus the 
sine of a third, maybe with coefficients here. So, somehow, since you were born, you 
have been ab le to take the f(t), and express it as the sum of the three signs. And, 
here, therefore,  the three tones that make up the triad. Now, the question is, how 
did you do that Fourier ana lysis? In other words, does your brain have a little 
integrator in it, which ca lculates the coefficients of that series? Of course, the answer 
is no. 

It has to do something else. So, one of the things I'd like to aim at in this lecture is 
just briefly exp laining what, in  fact, actua lly happens to do that. Now, to do that, 
we'll have to make some  little detours, as a lways. So,  first I'm going to, throughout 
the lecture, in fact, I gave you last time a couple of shortcuts for calculating Fourier 
series based on evenness and oddness, and also some expansion of the idea of 
Fourier series where we use the different, but things didn't have to be periodic or 
period two p i, but it can have an arb itrary period, 2L, and we could still get a Fourier 
expansion for it. 

Let me, therefore, begin just as a prob lem, another type of shortcut exercise, to do a 
Fourier calculation, which we are going to be later in the period to explain the music 
problem. So,  let's suppose we're starting with the function, f(t), which  is a rea l 
square wave, and I'll make its period different from the one, not two pi. So, suppose 
we had a function like this. So, this is one, and this  is one. So, the height is one, and 
this point is one as well. And then, it's period ic ever after that. I'll tell you what, let's 
do like the electrica l eng ineers do and put these vertica l lines there even though they 

don't exist. Okay, so the height is one and it goes over. The ha lf period is one. This 
really is a square wave. I mean, it's really a square, not what they usually call a 
square wave. 

So, my question is, what's its Fourier series? Well, it's neither even nor odd. That's a 
little dismaying. It sounds like we're going to have to ca lculate an's and bn's. So, the 
shortcuts I gave you last time don't seem to be applicable. Now, of course, nor is the 
period two p i, but that shouldn't be too bad. In fact, you ought to look for an 
expansion in terms of things that look like sin(n), well, what should it be? Since L is 
equa l to one, the ha lf period  is equal to one. Remember, the period is 2L, not L. It's 
n pi over L, but if L is one, we should be looking for an expansion in terms of 
functions that look  like this. Now, since we've already done the work for the officia l 
square way, which looks something like this, what you always try to do is reduce 
these things to problems that you've already solved. 

This is a legitimate one, since I solved it in lecture for you. So, we can consider it as 
something we know. So, I observed that since I am very lazy, that if I lower this 
function by one half, it w ill become an odd  function. Now  it's an odd function. Okay, I 
just cut the work in ha lf. So, let's ca ll this function, let's ca ll this, I don't know, S(t). 
The green one is the one we wanted to start w ith. So, f(t) is a green  function. But, I 
can improve things even more because the function that we ca lculated  in the lecture 
is a lot like this sa lmon function. That's why I ca lled it S. But, the d ifference is that 
the function we calculated with this one. In the first place, it went down  further. 

It went not to negative one half, which  is where that one goes. But, it went down to 
negative one, and then went up here to plus one. And, it went over to pi. So, it came 
down aga in, but not, but at the point, p i. And here, negative pi went up again. Okay, 
let me remind you what this one was. Suppose we ca ll it, O doesn't look good, I 
don't know, how about g(u)? Let's, for a secret reason, call the variab le u this time, 
okay? So, the previous knowledge that I'm relying on was that I derived the Fourier 
series for you by an orthodox calculation. And, it's not too hard to do because this is 
an odd  function. And therefore, you only have to calculate the bn's. 

And, half of them turn out to be zero, although you don't know that in advance. But 
anyway, the answer was 4 / p i times the sum of just the odd ones, the sin(nu) / n. 
So, this  is the expansion of g, this function, g of u, the Fourier expansion of this 
function. Since it's an odd function, it only involves the signs. There's no funny stuff 
here because the period is now two p i. And, this came from the first  lecture on 
Fourier series, or from the book, wherever you want it, or solutions to the notes. 
There are lots of sources for that. The solution's in the notes. Okay, now, that looks 
so much like the sa lmon function, ---

-- I ought to be ab le to convert one into the other. Now, I will do that by shrinking 
the axis. But, since this can get rather confusing, what I'll do is overlay this. What I 
prefer to do is I think u, okay, I'm chang ing, I'm keeping the thing the same. But, 
I'm going to change the name of the variable,  the t, in such a way that on the t-axis, 
this becomes the point, one. If I do that, then this function w ill turn exactly into that 
one, except it will go not from minus a ha lf to a half, but it w ill go  from negative one 
to one, since I haven't done anything to the vertica l axis. So, how I do that? What's 
the relation between u and t? Well, u is equal to pi times t, or the other way around. 
You know that it's going to be approximately this. Try one, and then check that it 
works. When t is equal to one, u is p i, which is what it's supposed to be. 

So, this  is the relation between the two. And therefore, without further ado, I can 
say that, let's write the relation between them. f(t) is what I want. Well, what's f of t 
if I subtract one ha lf of that? So, that's going to be equal to the salmon function p lus 
one ha lf, right, or the salmon  function is f of t lowered by one half. One thing is the 
same as the other. And, what's the relation between this salmon function and the 
orange function? Well, the sa lmon function is, so, let's convert, so, S(t) -- it's more 
convenient, as I wrote the formula g(u). Let's start it from that end. If I start from g 
of u, what do I have to do to convert  it into S of-- into the salmon function? 

Well, take one half of it. So, if I put them a ll together, the conclusion is that f(t) = 
1/2 + S(t), which is 1/2 g(u), but u  is pi t. So, it's, 4 / p i * sum(sin(n)). And,  for u, I 
will write p i t / n. And, sorry, I forgot to say that sum is only over the odd values of 
n, not all va lues of n. So, the sum over n odd of that, and, of course, the two will 
cancel that. So, here we have, in other words, just by this business of shrinking or 
just stretching or shrinking the axis, lowering it and squishing it that way a little bit. 

We get from this Fourier series, we get that one just by this geometric procedure. I'd 
like you to be able to do that because it saves a lot of time. Okay, so let's put this 
answer up in, I'm going to need it in a minute, but I don't rea lly want to recopy it. 
So, let me handle it by erasing. So, let's call that +2 / pi, and there is our formula 
for that green function that we wrote before. So, I'll put that in green. So, we'll have 
a color-coded lecture aga in. Now, what we're going to be doing ultimately,  to getting 
at the music problem  that I posed at the beginning of the lecture, is we want to 
solve, and this is what a study of Fourier series has been a iming at, to solve second-
order linear equations with constant coefficients were the right-hand side was a more 
general function than the kind we've been handling. 

So, now,  in order to simplify, and we don't have a lot of time in the course, I'd have 
to take another day to make more comp licated calculations, which I don't want to do 
since you will learn a lot from them, anyway. I think you will find you've had enough 
calculation by the time Friday morning  rolls around. So, let's look at the undamped 
case, which is simpler, or undamped spring, or undamped anything because it 
doesn't have that extra term, which requires extra ca lculations. So, I'll follow the 
book now and some of the notes and the visuals, and called the independent 
variable-- the dependent variable I'm going to call x now. And, the independent 
variable is, as usual, time. 

So, this  is going to be, in general,  f(t), and I'm going to use it by calculating 
example, this is the actua l f of t I'm going to be using. But, the general problem for a 
general f of t is to solve this, or at least to find a particular solution. That's what 
most of the work is, because we a lready know how from that to get the general 
solution by add ing the solution to the reduced equation, the associated 
homogeneous equation. 

So, all our work has been,  this past couple of weeks, in how you find a particular 
solution. Now, the case in which we know what to do is, so we can find our particular 
solution. Let's call that x sub p. We could  find x sub p if the right hand side is cosine 
omega, well, in genera l, an exponential, but since we are not going to use complex 
exponentia ls today, all these things are rea l. 

And I'd like to keep them rea l. If it's either cos(omega t) or sin(omega t), or some 
multip le of that by linearity, it's just as good. We a lready know how to find the thing, 
and to find a particular solution. So, the procedure is use complex exponentials, and 

that mag ic formula I gave you. But, right now, just to save a little time, since I 
already d id that on the lecture on resonance, I solved it explicitly for that, and you've 
had adequate practice I think in the prob lem sets. Let's simp ly write down the 
answer that comes out of that. The answer for the particular solution is cos(omega t) 
or sin(omega t). 

That's the top. And, it's over a constant. And, the constant is (omega0)^2. That's 
the natura l frequency which comes from the system, minus the imposed frequency, 
the driving frequency that the system, the spring or whatever it is, undamped 
spring, is being driven with. Okay, understand the notation. Cosine this over that, or 
sine, depending on whether you started driving it w ith cosine or sine. So, this is from 
the lecture, if you like, from the lecture on resonance, but aga in it's, I hope by now, 
a familiar fact. Let me remind you what this had to do with resonance. Then, the 
observation was that if omega, the driving frequency is very close to the natural 
frequency, then this  is close to that. 

The denominator is a lmost zero, and that makes the amp litude of the response very, 
very large. And, that was the phenomenon of resonance. Okay, now what I'd like to 
do is apply those formulas to finding out what happens for a genera l f(t), or in 
particular this one. So, in genera l, I'll keep using the notation, f(t), even though I've 
sorted used  it for that. But in genera l, what's the situation? If f of t is a sine series, 
cosine series, all right, let's do everything. Suppose it's, in other words, the 
procedure  is, take your f of t, expand it in a Fourier series. 

Well, doesn't that assume it's period ic? Yes, sort of. So, suppose it's a Fourier series. 
I'll make a very general Fourier series, write it this way: cos( (omega)n t), and then 
the sine terms, sin( (omega)n t) from one to  infinity where the omegas are, omega n 
is short for that. Well, it's going to have the n in it, of course, but I want, now,  to 
make the general period to be 2L. So, it would be n p i / L. Of course, if L is equa l to 
one, then it's n p i. Or, if L equals p i, those are the two most popular cases, by far. 
Then, it's simply n itself, the driving frequency. But,  this would be the general case, 
n pi / L if the period is the period of f(t) is 2L. 

So, that's what the Fourier series looks like. Okay, then the particular solution will be 
what? Well, I got these formulas. In other words, what I'm using is superposition 
principle. If it's just this, then I know what the answer is for the particular solution, 
the response. So, if you make a sum of these things, a sum of these inputs, you are 
going to get a sum of the responses by superposition. So, let's write out the ones we 
are absolutely certain of. What's the response to here? Well, it's (a)n cos((omega)n 
t). The only thing is, now it's divided by (omega0)^2. This constant has changed, 
and the same thing here. 

Of course, by linearity, if this is multip lied by a, then the answer is multip lied by, the 
response  is also multiplied by a. So, the same thing happens here. Here, it's (b)n 
and over, aga in, (omega0)^2 - omega sin(omega t). So, in other words, as soon as 
you have the Fourier expansion,  the Fourier series for the input, you automatica lly 
get this by just writing it down the Fourier series for the response. 

That's the fundamental idea of Fourier series, at least applied in this context. They 
have many other contexts, approximations, so on and so forth. But, that's the idea 
here. All right, what about that constant term? Well, this formula still works if omega 
equa ls zero. If omega equals zero,  then this is the constant, one. The formula is still 
correct. Omega is zero here. The only thing you have to remember is that the 

orig ina l thing is written in this form. So, the response will be, what will it be? Well, 
it's one d ivided by omega naught squared, if I'm in the case omega0 = 0. So, it's a 
zero d ivided by two omega naught squared. And, as you w ill see, it looks just like 
the others. You're just taking omega, and making it equa l to zero  for that particular 
case. Sorry, this should be omega n's all the way through here. 

All right, well, let's apply this to  the green function. So, what have we got? We have 
its Fourier series. So, if the green function is, if the input in other words is this 
square wave, the green square wave, so in your notes, this guy, this particular f(t) is 
the input. And, the equation is x'' + (omega0)^2 x = f(t). Then, the response is, 
well, I can't draw you a p icture of the response because I don't know what the 
Fourier series actua lly looks like. But, let's at least write down what the Fourier 
series is. 

The Fourier series will be, well, what is it? It's one ha lf. The constant out front is one 
half, except it's 1 / (2 omega0^2). So, this is my function, f(t). That's the genera l 
formula for how the input is related to the response. And, I'm app lying it to this 
particular function,  f(t). And, the answer is plus. Well, my Fourier series  involves 
only odd sums, only the summation over odd, and only of the sign. So, it is going to 
be 2 / p i, sorry, so it's going to be two over p i out front. 

That constant w ill carry along by linearity. And, I'm going to sum over odd, n odd 
values only. The basic thing in the upsta irs is going to be the sin( (omega)n t). But, 
what is (omega)n? Well, (omega)n is n p i. So, it's n pi t. And, how about the 
bottom? The bottom is going to be (omega0)^2 - (omega)n^2. And, this is my 
(omega)n, - (n pi)^2. What's that? Well, I don't know. All I could do would be to 
calculate it. You could put it on Matlab and ask Matlab to calculate and p lot for you 
the first few terms, and get some vague idea of what it looks like. That's nice, but 
it's not what's interesting to do. 

What's interesting to do is to look at the size of the coefficients. And, again, rather 
than do it in the abstract, let's take a specific va lue. Let's suppose that the natural 
frequency of the system, in other words, the frequency at which that little spring 
wants to go vibrate back and forth, whatever you got vibrating. Let's suppose the 
natural frequency that's omega naught is ten  for the sake of definiteness, as they 
say. 

Okay, if that's ten, all I want to do is calculate in the crudest possible way what a 
few of these terms are. So, the response is, so let's see, we've got to give that a 
name. The response  is (x)p (t). What's (x)p of t? I'm just going to ca lculate it very 
approximately. This means, you know, throwing caution to the winds because I don't 
have a calculator with me. And, I want you to look at this thing w ithout a calculator. 
The first term is 1/200. Okay, that's the only term I can get exactly right. 
[LAUGHTER] Or, I could if I could ca lculate. I suppose it's 0.005, right? That's the 
constant term. 

Okay, so the next term, let's see, two over pi is two thirds. I'll keep that in mind, 
right? P lus two thirds, 0.6, let's say, that's an indication of the accuracy with which 
these things are going to be performed. I think in Texas for a long while, the 
leg islature declared pi to be three, anyways. One of those states did it to save 
calculation time. I'm not kidd ing, by the way. All right, so what's the first term? If n 
equa ls one, I have the sin(pi t). That's the n equals one term. What's the 
denominator like? That's about 100 - 9^2. Let's say it's 91, sine t over 91. What's 

the next term? sin(3 pi t), remember, I am omitting, I'm only using the odd va lues 
of n because those are the only ones that enter into  the Fourier expansion for this 
function, which is at the bottom of everything. 

All right, what's the sin(3 pi t)? Well, now, I've got 100 minus three p i, -- -- that's 9 
squared is 81. So, no, what am I doing? So, we have 100 minus three times pi is 9, 
squared. Well,  let's say a little more. Let's say 85. So, that's 15. How bout the next 
one? Well, it's sin(5 p i t). I think I'll stop here as soon as we do this one because at 
this point it's clear what's happening. This is 100 squared minus, that's 15 squared is 
225, so that's about 125 with a negative sign. So, minus this divided by 125. And, 
after this they are going to get rea lly quite small because the next one will be (7 
pi)^2. That's 400, and this is becoming neg ligib le. 

So, what's happening? So, it's approximately, in other words, 0.005 p lus the next 
coefficient is, let's see, 6/10, let's say 100, sine pi t. And, what comes next? Well, it's 
now 1/20th. It's about a 20th. Let's ca ll that 0.005 sin(3 p i t), and now so small, 
minus 0.01, let's say times this last one, sine 5 pi t. What you find, in other words, is 
that the frequencies which make up the response do not occur with the same 
amplitude. 

What happens is that this amp litude is roughly five times larger than any of the 
neighboring ones. And after that,  it's a lot larger than the ones that come later. In 
other words, the main frequency which occurs in the response is the frequency three 
pi. What's happened is, in other words, near resonance has occurred. So, if omega is 
ten, very near resonance, that  is, it's not too close, but it's not too far away either, 
occurs for the frequency three p i in the  input. Now, where's the frequency three p i in 
the input? It isn't there. It's just that green thing. Where in that is the frequency 
three pi? 

I can't answer that for you, but that's the function of Fourier series, to say that you 
can decompose that green function into a sum of frequencies, as it were, and the 
Fourier coefficients tell you how much frequency goes into each of those f of t's. 
Now, so,  f of t is decomposed into the sum of frequencies by the Fourier analysis. 
But,  the system isn't going to respond equa lly to all those frequencies. It's going to 
pick out and  favor the one which  is closest to its natural frequency. So, what's 
happened, these frequencies, the frequencies and their relative  importance in f(t) are 
hidden, as it were. They're hidden because we can't see them unless you do the 
Fourier ana lysis, and look at the size of the coefficients. 

But,  the system can pick out. The system picks out and favors, picks out for 
resonance, or resonates with, resonates with the frequencies closest to its natural 
frequency. Well, suppose the system had natura l frequency, not ten. This is a put up 
job. Suppose it had natural frequency five. Well, in that case, none of them are close 
to the hidden  frequencies in f(t), and there would be no resonance. But, because of 
the particular va lue I gave here, I gave the value ten, it's ab le to p ick out n equals 
three as the most important, the corresponding three pi as the most important 
frequency in the input, and  respond to that. 

Okay, so this  is the way we hear, give or take a few thousand pages. So, what does 
the ear do? How does the ear, so, it's got that thing, messy curve, which I erased, 
which has a secret, which just has three hidden frequencies. Okay,  from now on I 
hand wave, right, like they do in other subjects. So, we got our frequency. So, it's 
got a [SINGS]. That's one frequency. [SINGS] And, what goes  in there is the sum of 

those three, and the ear has to do something to say out of all the frequencies in the 
world, I'm going to respond to that one, that one, and that one, and send a signa l to 
the brain, which the bra in, then, will interpret as a beautiful triad. 

Okay, so what happens is that the ear, I don't talk physiology, and I never will again. 
I know nothing about it, but anyway, the ear, when you get far enough in there, 
there are  little three bones, bang, bang, bang; this  is the eardrum, and then there's 
the part which has wax. Then, there's the eardrum which vibrates, at least if there is 
not too much wax in your ear. And then,  the vibrations go through three little bones 
which send  the vibrations to the inner ear, which nobody ever sees. 

And, the inner ear, then, is filled with thick fluid and a membrane, and the last bone 
hits up against the membrane, and the membrane vibrates. And, that makes the 
fluid vibrate. Okay, good. So,  it's vibrating according to the function f(t). Well, what 
then? Well, that's the marvelous part. It's almost impossible to believe, but there is 
this, sort of  like a snail thing inside. I've forgotten the name. It's cochlea. And, it has 
these ha irs. They are not ha irs really. I don't know what else to call them. They're 
not ha irs. But, there are things so long, you know, they stick up. And, there are 
20,000 of them. And, they are of different lengths. And, each one  is tuned to a 
certain frequency. 

Each one has a certa in natural frequency, and they are all d ifferent, and they are a ll 
graded, just like a bunch of organ p ipes. And, when that complicated wave hits, the 
complicated wave hits, each one resonates to a hidden frequency in the wave, which 
is closest to its natural frequency. Now, most of them won't be resonating at all. 
Only the ones close to the frequency [SINGS], they'll resonate, and the nearby guys 
will resonate, too, because they will be nearby, almost have the same natura l 
frequency. And, over here, there w ill be a few which resonate to [SINGS], and finally 
over here a few which go [SINGS], and each of those little ha irs, little groups of ha irs 
will signal, send that signal to the auditory nerve somehow or other, which will then 
carry these three inputs to the bra in, and the brain, then, w ill interpret that as you 
are hearing [SINGS]. 

So, the Fourier ana lysis is done by resonance. You here resonance because each of 
these things has a certain natura l frequency which is able, then, to pick out a 
resonant frequency  in the input. I'd like to finish our work on Fourier series. So,  for 
homework I'm asking you to do something similar. Taken an input. I gave you a 
frequency here, a different omega0, a different input, as you by means of this 
Fourier ana lysis to find out which it w ill resonate, which of the hidden frequencies in 
the input the system w ill resonate to, just so you can work it out yourself and do it. 

Now, I'd like to  first try to match up what I just did by this formula with what's in 
your book, since your book handles the identical problem but a  little differently, and 
it's essentially the same. But I think I'd better say something about it. So, the book's 
method, and to the extent which any of these problems are worked out in the notes, 
the notes do this, too. Use substitution. Base uses d ifferentiation of Fourier series 
term by term. The work is almost exactly the same as here. And, it has a slight 
advantage, that it a llows you,  the book's method has a slight advantage that it 
allows you to  forget this formula. You don't have to know this formula. 

It will come out in the wash. Now, for some of you, that may be of colossa l 
importance,  in which case, by a ll means, use the book's method, term by term. So, it 
requires no knowledge of this formula because after a ll, I base this solution, I simply 

wrote down the solution and I based it on the fact that I was ab le to write down 
immed iately the solution to this and put as being that response. And for that, I had 
to remember it, or be willing to use complex exponentials quickly to remind myself. 
There's very, very little difference between the two. Even if you have to re-derive 
that formula, the two take almost about the same length of time. But anyway,  the 
idea is simp ly this. With the book, you assume. In other words, you take your 
function, f(t). You expand it in a Fourier series. Of course, which signs and cosines 
you use will depend upon what the period is. 

So, you assume the solution of the form-- Well,  if I,  for examp le, carried out in this 
particular case, I don't know if I will do all the work, but it would be natural to 
assume a solution of the form, since the  input looks like the green guy. Assume a 
solution which looks the same. In other words,  it w ill have a constant term because 
the input does. But all the rest of the terms will be sines. So, it w ill be something like 
(c)n sin(n pi t). The only question is, what are the (c)n's? Well, I found one method 
up there. But,  the genera l method is just p lug-in. Substitute into the ODE. Substitute 
into  the ODE. 

You differentiate this tw ice to do it. So, I'll do the double differentiation and I won't 
stop the lecture there, but I will stop the calculation there because it has nothing 
new to offer. And, this is the way all the ca lculations in the books and the solutions 
and the notes are carried out. So, I don't think you'll have any troub le. Well, this 
term vanishes. This term becomes what? If I differentiate this tw ice, I get 
summation, so, this is one to infinity because I don't know which of these are 
actually going to appear. Summation one to infinity, (c)n times, well, if you 
differentiate the sine twice, you get negative sine, right? Do it once: you get cosine. 
Second time: you get negative sine. But, each time you will get this extra factor n p i 
from the cha in rule. And so, the answer will be -(c)n * (n pi)^2 sin(n pi t). 

And so, the procedure is, very simply, you substitute (x)p double prime into the 
differentia l equation. In other words, if you do it, we w ill multiply this by 
(omega0)^2. And, you add them. And then, on the left-hand side, you are going to 
get a sum of terms, sin(n pi t) times coefficients involving the (c)n's. And, on the 
right, so, you're going to get a sum involving the (c)n's, and the sines n pi t, and on 
the right, you're going to get the Fourier series for f(t), which is exactly the same 
kind of expression. The only difference is, now the sines have come with definite 
coefficients. And then, you simply click the coefficients on the left and the 
coefficients on the right, and  figure out what the (c)n's are. 

So, by equating coefficients, you get the (c)n's. Would you like me to carry it out? 
Yeah, okay, I was going to do something else, but I wouldn't have time to do it 
anyway. So, why don't I take two minutes to complete the calculation just so you 
can see you get the same answer? All right, what do we get? If you add them up, 
you get c naught, out front, p lus (c)n  is multiplied by what? Well, from the top it's 
multip lied by (omega0)^2. On the bottom, it's multip lied by (n pi)^2. Ah-ha, where 
have I seen that comb ination? 

The sum is equal to, sorry, one half p lus what  is it, sum over n odd of sine sin(n pi t) 
/ n. So, the conclusion is that-- I'm sorry, it should be c0 (omega0)^2. So, what's 
the conclusion? If c0 = 1 / (2 (omega0)^2), and that (c)n, only for n odd, the others 
will be even. The others will be zero. The (c)n = 2 / p i. So,  it's going to be two p i, 
2/pi * 1/n * 1/((omega0)^2 - (n pi)^2). 

This is terrible, which is the same answer we got before, I hope. Did I cover it up? 
Same answer. So, that answer at the left-hand end of the board is the same one. 
I've calculated, in other words, what the c zeros are. And, I got the same answer as 
before.
