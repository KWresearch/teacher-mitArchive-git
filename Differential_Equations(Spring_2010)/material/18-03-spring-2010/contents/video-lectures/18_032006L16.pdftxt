Transcript â€“ Lecture 16 

Okay, that's, so to speak, the text for today. The Fourier series, and the Fourier 
expansion for f(t), so  f of t, if it looks like this should be period ic, and two pi should 
be a period. Sometimes people rather sloppily say periodic w ith period two pi, but 
that's a little ambiguous. So, this period could also be pi or a half pi or something 
like that as well. The an's and bn's are calculated according to these formulas. Now, 
we're going to need in just a minute a consequence of those formulas, which, it's not 
subtle, but because there are formulas for an and bn, it follows that once you know 
f(t), the an's and bn's are determined. 

Or, to put  it another way, a function cannot have two different Fourier series. Or, to 
put it yet another way, if f(t),  if two functions are equal, you'll see why I write it in 
this rather peculiar form. Then, the Fourier series for f is the same as the Fourier 
series for g. And, the reason is because if f = g,  then this integral w ith an  f there  is 
the same as the integra l with a g there. And therefore, the an's come out to be the 
same. In the same way, the bn's come out to be the same. So, the Fourier series are 
the same, coefficient by coefficient, for f and g. Now, my ultimate goa l-- let's all put 
down the argument since there are formulas, since we have formulas for an and bn. 

Now, a consequence of that is, well, let me first say, what I'm aiming at is you will 
be amazed at how long it's going to take me to get to this. I just want to ca lculate 
the Fourier series for some rather simple period ic function. It's going to look like this. 
So, here's pi, and here's negative p i. So, the function which just looks like t in 
between those two, so, it goes up to, it's a  function, t, more or less, goes up to pi 
here, minus pi there. But, of course, it's got to be periodic of period two p i. 

Well, then, it just repeats itself after that. After this, it just does that, and so on. It's 
a little ambiguous what happens at these endpoints. Well, let's not worry about that 
for the moment, and frankly, it won't really matter because the integra ls don't care 
about what happens in ind ividua l points. So, there's my f(t). Now, I, of course, could 
start doing it right away. But, you w ill quickly find, if you start doing these prob lems 
and hacking around with them, that the ca lculations seem rea lly quite long. And 
therefore, in the first ha lf of the period, the first half of the period I want to show 
you how to shorten the calculations. 

And in the second half of the period, after we've done that and ca lculated this thing 
successfully, I hope, I want to show you how to remove various restrictions on these 
functions, how to extend the range of Fourier series. Well, one obvious thing,  for 
example, is suppose the function isn't periodic of period two pi. Suppose it has some 
other period. Does that mean there's no  formula? Well, of course not. There's a 
formula. But, we need to know what  it is, particularly in the applications, the period 
is rarely two p i. It's normally one, or something  like that. But,  let's first of all, I'm 
sure what you will appreciate is how the calculations can get shortened. 

Now, the ma in way of shortening them is by using evenness and oddness. And, what 
I cla im is this, that if f(t) is an even function, remember what that means, that f(-t) 

= f(t). Cosine is a good examp le, of course, cos(nt); are all these functions are even 
functions. If f of t is even, then its Fourier series conta ins only the cosine terms. 

In other words, half the calculations you don't have to do if you start w ith an even 
function. That's what I mean by shortening the work. There are no odd terms, or 
let's put it positively. All the bn's are zero. Now, one way of doing this would be to 
say, well, y to the bn zero, well, we've got formulas, and fool around w ith the 
formula for the bn, and think about a little b it, and fina lly decide that that has to 
come out to be zero. That's not a bad way, and it would  remind you of some basic 
facts about integration, about integra ls. 

Instead of doing that, I'm going to apply my little princip le that if two  functions are 
the same,  then their Fourier series have to be the same. So, the argument I'm going 
to g ive is this, so, I'm going to try to prove this statement now. And, I'm going to 
use the facts on the first board to do it. So, what is f(-t)? Well, if that's equa l to f(t), 
then in terms of the Fourier series, how do I get the Fourier series for f(-t)? Well, I 
take the Fourier series for f(t), and substitute t = -t. Now, what happens when I do 
that? So, the Fourier series for this looks like a0 / 2 p lus summation what? 

Well, the an cos(nt), that does not change because when I change t --> -t, the 
cos(nt) does not change, stays the same because it's an even function. What 
happens to the sine term? Well, the sin(-nt) = -sin(nt). So, the other terms, the sine 
terms change sign. So, all that's the result of substituting  t --> -t and f(t). On the 
other hand, what's f(t) itself? Well, f of t itself is what happened before that. Now it's 
got a plus sign because nothing was done to the series. Well, if the function is even, 
then those two right hand sides are the same function. In other words, they're like 
my f(t) = g(t). 

And therefore, the Fourier series on the left must be the same. In other words, if 
these are equa l, therefore, these have to be equal, too. Now, there's no prob lem 
with the cosine terms. They look the same. On the other hand, the sine terms have 
changed sign. Therefore, it must be the case that bn is always equal to negative bn 
for a ll n. That's the only way this series can be the same as that one. Now, if bn = -
bn, that implies that bn = 0. Zero is the only number which is equa l to its negative. 
And so, by this argument,  in other words, using  the uniqueness of Fourier series, we 
conclude that  if the function is even, then its Fourier series can only have cosine 
terms in it. 

Now, you say, hey,  that's obvious. The cosine, that's just a point of logic. But, this is 
a mathematics course, after all. It's not just about ca lculation. Many of you would 
say, yeah, of course that's obvious because cosines are even, and the sines are odd. 
I say, yeah, and so why does that make it true? Well, the cosine's even. Plus t into 
minus t, and what you are proving is the converse. 

The converse is obvious. Yeah, obvious, I don't care. If the right-hand side is the 
sum of the functions, well, so is the left. But I'm saying it the other way around. If 
the left is an even function, why does the right-hand side have to have only even 
terms in it? And,  this is the argument which makes that true. Now, there is a further 
simplification because if you've got an even function, oh, by the way, of course the 
same thing is true for the odd, I ought to put that down, and so a lso, if f(t) is odd, 
then I think one of these proofs is enough. 

The other you can supply yourself. That will imply that a ll the an's are zero, even 
includ ing this first one, a0, and by the same reasoning. So, an even function uses 
only cosines for its Fourier expansion. An odd function uses only sines. Good. But, 
we still have to, suppose we got an even function. We've still got to calculate this 
integral. Well, even that can be simplified. So, the second stage of the simp lification, 
again, assuming that we have an even or odd function, and by the way, 
[LAUGHTER]. 

Tota lly unauthorized. So, if f(t) is even, what we'd like to do now is simplify the 
integral a little. And, there is an easy way to do  that, because, look, if f of t is an 
even function, then so is f(t) cos(nt), is a lso even. Imag ine, we could make little 
rules about an even function times an even function  is an even function. There are 
general rules of that type, and some of you know them, and they are very useful. 
But,  let's just do it ad hoc here. If I change t --> -t here, I don't change the function 
because it's even. And, I don't change the cosine because that's even. So, if I 
change t to negative t, I don't change the function. Either factor that function, and 
therefore I don't change the product of those two things either. 

So, it's also even. Now, what about an even function when you  integrate it? Here's a 
typica l looking even function, let's say, something like, I don't know, w iggle, wigg le, 
again. Here's our better even  function. All right, so, minus pi to p i, even, even 
though the t-axis is somewhat curvy. So, there is an even function. The point is that 
if you integrate an even function  from negative pi to p i, I think you all know even 
from calculus you were taught to do this simplification. Don't do that. Instead, 
integrate from zero to p i, and double the answer. 

Why should you do that? The answer is because it's always nice to have zero as one 
of the limits of integration. I trust to your experience, I don't have to sell that. Minus 
pi is a particularly unpleasant lower limit of integration because you are sure to get 
in troub le w ith negative signs. There are bound  to be at least three negative signs 
floating around. And, if you miss one of them, you'll get the wrong signs of answer. 

The answer will have the wrong sign. So, the way the formula from  this simp lifies is 
that an, instead of integrating from negative pi to pi, I can integrate only from zero 
to p i, and doub le the answer. So, our better formula is this. If the function is even, 
this is the formula you should use: Integra l from 0 to pi of [f(t) cos(nt) dt]. Of 
course, I don't have to tell you what bn should be because bn will be zero. And,  in 
the same way, if f is odd, the same reasoning shows that bn-- of course, an will be 
zero this time. But it will be bn = 2 / p i * Integral from 0 to p i of [f(t) sin(nt) dt]. 

Maybe we'd better just a word about that since, why is that so? If it's odd, doesn't 
that mean things become zero? If you integrate an odd  function  like that,  the 
integral over minus pi to p i, you get zero. Well, but this is not an odd function. This 
is an odd function, and this is an odd function. But the product of two odd functions 
is an even  function. Odd times odd is even. I sa id I wasn't going to g ive you those 
rules, but since this is the one which trips everybody up, maybe I'd better say it just 
justbecause it looks wrong. 

Right, this is odd. That's odd. Think about  it. If I change t --> -t, this multiplies by 
minus one. This multip lies by minus one. And therefore, the product multip lies by -1 
* -1. In other words, it multip lies by plus one. Nothing happens, so  it stays the 
same. Why does nobody believe this, even though it's true? It's because they are 
thinking about numbers. Everybody knows that an odd number times an odd number 

is an odd number. So, I'm not multiplying numbers here, which a lso I'll put them in 
boxes to ind icate that they are not numbers. How's that? Brand-new invented 
notation. The box means caution. The inside is not a number, it's the word odd or 
even. 

It's just a symbolic statement that the product of an odd function and an odd 
function is an even function. Even times even is even. What's odd times even? Yes, it 
has to get equa l time. Obviously, something must come out to be odd, right. Okay, 
so, now that we've got our two simplifications, we are ready to do this problem. 
Instead of attacking it w ith the original formulas, we are going to think about it and 
attack it w ith our better formulas. 

So, now we are going to ca lculate the Fourier series for f(t). The first thing I see, so f 
of t is our little thing here. Well, first of all, what kind of function is it: odd, even, or 
neither? Most functions are neither, of course. But, fortunately in the applications, 
functions tend to be one or the other. Or, they can be converted into one to the 
other. Maybe if I get a chance, I'll show you a little how, or the recitations will. So, 
this function is odd. Okay, half the work just disappeared. I don't have to calculate 
any an's. They will be zero. 

So, I only have to calculate bn, and I'll calculate them by my better formula. So, it's 
two over pi times the integra l from zero to pi, and what I have to integrate, well, 
now, finally you've got to integrate something. From zero to pi, this is the function,  t. 
So, I have to integrate: bn = 2 / pi * Integral from 0 to pi of [t*sin(nt) dt]. Okay, so 
this is why you learned integration by parts, one of many reasons why you learned 
integration by parts, so that you wouldn't have to pull out your little calculators to do 
this. 

Okay, now, let's do it. So, it's 2 / pi. Let's solve that away so we can forget about it. 
And, what's then left is just the evaluation of the integra l between limits. So, if I 
integrate by parts, I'll want to differentiate the t, and integrate the sign, right? So, 
the first step is you don't do the d ifferentiation. You only do the integration. So, that 
integrates to be cos(nt) / n, more or less. The only thing is, if I d ifferentiate this, I 
get -sin(nt) instead of, so, I want to put a negative sign in  front of all this. And, I will 
eva luate that between the limits, zero and p i, and then subtract what you get by 
doing both things, both the d ifferentiation and the integration. So, I subtract the 
integral from zero to pi. 

I now differentiate the t, and integrate. Well, I just d id the integration. That's -
cos(nt) / n. You see how the negative signs p ile up? And, if this is negative p i instead 
of zero, it's at that point when it starts to lose heart. You see three negative signs, 
and then when you substitute, you're going to have to put in still something else 
negative, and you just have the feeling you're going to make a mistake. 

And, you will. Okay, now all we have to do is a little eva luation. Let's see, at the 
lower limit I get zero, here. Let's right away, as two over pi. At the lower limit, I get 
zero. That's nice. At the upper limit, I get -pi / n cos(n p i). Now, once and for all, the 
cos(n pi)-- If you like to make separate steps out of everything, okay, I'll let you do 
it this time, --

-- but in the long run, it's good to remember that that's (-1)^n. The cosine of p i is 
minus one . The cos(2 p i) = +1, cos(3 pi) = -1, and so on. So, at the upper limit, we 

get -pi / n cos(n pi), which is (-1)^n. And now, how about the other guy? Shall we 
do in our heads? Well, I can do  it in my head, but I'm not so sure about your heads. 

Maybe just this once we won't. What is it? It's +sin(nt), right? So, I comb ined the 
two negative signs to a p lus sign by putting one this way and the other one that 
way. And then, if I integrate that now, it's sin(nt) / n^2, right? And that's evaluated 
between zero and p i. And of course, the sign function vanishes at both ends. So, that 
part is simp ly zero. And so, the fina l answer is that bn is equa l to, well, the pi's 
cancel. This minus comb ines w ith those n to make one more. And so, the answer is 
(2 / n)*(-1)^(n + 1). 

And therefore, the final result is that our Fourier series, the Fourier series for f(t), 
that funny function  is, the Fourier series is summation bn, which is two, put the two 
out front because it's in every term. There's no reason to repeat it, (-1)^(n + 1) / n 
* sin(nt). That's summed from one to infinity. Let's stop and take a look at that for a 
second. Does that look right? Okay, here's our function. 

Here's our function. What's the first term of this? When n = 1, this is p lus one. So, 
the first term is sin(t). What's the next term? When n is two, this  is negative. So, it's 
(-1)^3. So, that's -1/2. So,  it's -1/2 sin(2t), and then it obviously continues in the 
same way p lus a 1/3 sin(3t). Now, watch carefully because what I'm going to say in 
the next minute is the heart of Fourier series. I've g iven you that visual to look at to 
try to reinforce this, but it's rea lly very important, as you go to the termina l yourself 
and do that work, simple as it is, and pay attention now. 

Now, if you think old-fashioned, i.e.  if you think taylor series, you're not going to 
believe this because you w ill say, well, let's see, these go on and on. Obviously,  it's 
the first term that's the important one. That's 2 sin(t). Now, the derivative, two sine 
t, sine t would exactly follow the p ink curve. Sine t would look like this. 2 sin(t) goes 
up with the wrong angle. The first term,  in other words, does this. It's going off with 
the wrong slope. Now, that's the whole point of Fourier series. Fourier series is not 
trying to approximate the function at zero at the central starting point the way 
Taylor series do. 

Fourier series tries to  treat the whole interval, and approximate the function nicely 
over the entire interva l, in this case, minus p i to pi, as well as possible. Taylor series 
concentrates at this point, does it the best it can at this point. Then it tries, with the 
next term, to do a  little better, and then a little better. The whole philosophy is 
entirely d ifferent. Taylor series are used for analyzing what a  function of looks like 
which you stick close to the base point. 

Fourier series ana lyze what a  function looks like over the whole interval. And, to do 
that, you should therefore a im to, so the first approximation is going to look like 
that, going to have entirely the wrong slope. But, the next one will subtract off 
something which sort of helps to fix it up. I can't draw  this. That's why I'm send ing 
you to the visual because the visua l draws them beautifully. And, it shows you how 
each successive term corrects the Fourier series, and makes the sum a little closer to 
what you started w ith. 

So, the next guy would, let's see, so it's 2t. So, I'm subtracting off, probably I'm just 
guessing, but I don't dare draw this. I haven't prepared to draw it, and I know I'll get 
it wrong. So, okay, your exercise. But,  it'll look better. It'll go, maybe, something 
like,  let's see, it has to end up... some of it gets subtracted off... I don't know what  it 

looks like. When you use the visua l at the computer termina l, I've asked you to use 
it three times on a variety of functions. 

I think this is maybe even one of them. Notice that you can set the parameter, you 
can set the coefficients independently. In other words, you can go back and correct 
your works, improving the earlier coefficients, and it won't affect anything you did 
before. But, the most vivid way to do it is to  try to get, visually, by moving the 
slider, to try to get the very best value for the first coefficient you can, and look at 
the curve. 

Then get the very best value for the second coefficient and see how that improves 
the approximation, and the third, and so on. And, the point  is, watch the 
approximations approaching the function nicely over the whole interval instead of 
concentrating a ll their goodness at the origin the way a Taylor series would. Now, 
there is still one mathematical point left. It's that equa lity sign, which is wrong. 

Why is it wrong? Well, what I'm saying is that if I add that the series, it adds up to 
f(t). Now, it almost does but not quite. And, I'd better give you the rule, the 
theorem. Of all the theorems in this course that aren't being proved, this is the one 
that would be most outside the scope of this course,  the one which I would most like 
to prove, in  fact, just because I'm a mathematician but wouldn't dare. 

The theorem  tells you when a Fourier series converges to the function you started 
with. And, the essence of  it is this. If f is continuous, is a continuous function, let's 
give the point, it's confusing just to keep ca lling  it t. If you like, ca ll it t, but I think it 
would be better to ca ll it t0 just to ind icate I'm looking at a specific point. So, if the 
function is continuous there, the value of f(t) is equa l to, the Fourier series 
converges, and it's equa l to its Fourier series,  the sum of the Fourier series at t0. 

And, the fact that I can even use the word sum means that the Fourier series 
converges. In other words, when you add up a ll these guys, you don't go to infinity 
or get something which just oscillates around crazily. They really do add up to 
something. Now, if f is not continuous at t0, this emphatically w ill not be the case. It 
will definitely not, but by far, the kinds of discontinuities which occur in the 
applications are ones like in this p icture, where the discontinuities are jump 
discontinuities. 

They are a lmost a lways jump discontinuities. And, in that case,  in other words, they 
are isolated. The function looks good here and here, but there's a break. Typ ica lly, 
electrica l eng ineers just don't leave a gap because they like, I don't know why. But 
electrica l eng ineer, and others of his or her ilk would draw that function like this, like 
a rip saw tooth. Even those vertica l lines have no meaning whatever, but they make 
people look happier. So, if f has a jump d iscontinuity at t0, and as I said,  that's the 
most important kind, then f(t), then the Fourier series adds up to, converges to, it 
converges, and it converges to the mid point of the jump. 

Let me just write it out in words like that, the midpoint of the jump. That's the way 
we'll be using it in this course. There's a notation for this, and  it's in your book. But, 
those of you who would be interested in such things would know it anyway. So, let's 
just ca ll it the midpoint of the jump. So, if I ask you,  to what does this converge? In 
other words, this series, what this shows is that the series, I'll write it out in the 
abbreviated form, Sum of [(-1)^(n + 1) / n * sin(nt)], what's the sum of the series? 

What is it? Let's ca ll this not  little f(t). Let's ca ll it capital F(t). I want to know, what's 
the graph of cap ita l F of t? Well, the initia l thing is to say, well, it must be the same 
as the graph of the function you started w ith. And, my answer is a lmost, but not 
quite. In fact, what will its graph look like? Well, regardless of what definition I made 
for the endpoints of those p ink lines, this function w ill converge to the following. 
From here to here, I'll draw it. I won't put in minus pi's. I'll leave that to your 
imagination. So, there's a hole at the end here. 

In other words, the end of the line is not included. And, the end of this line, 
regard less of whether it was included to start with or not, it's not now. And here, 
similarly, I start it here w ith a hole, and then go down parallel to the function, t, 
slope one. And now, how do I fill  in, so the missing places, this is the point, p i. This 
is the point, negative p i, and there are similar points as I go out. Well, since the 
function is continuous here, the Fourier series will converge to this orange line. But 
here, there's a jump discontinuity, and therefore, the Fourier series,  this function 
converges to the midpoint of the jump,  in other words, to here. This function, in 
other words, converges to this very discontinuous looking function, and rather odd 
how these points are, I say, but  in this case, I can prove to you that it converges 
here by ca lculating it. 

Look, this is the point, pi. What happens when you p lug in t = pi? You get everyone 
of these terms is zero, and therefore the sum is zero. So,  it certa inly converges, and 
it converges to zero. Now, that's a general theorem. It's rather d ifficult to prove. You 
would have to take, aga in, an ana lysis course. But, I don't even get to  it in the 
analysis course which I teach. If I had another semester I'd get to it, but I can't get 
everything. Anyway, we're not going to get to it this semester to your infinite relief. 
But, you should know the theorem anyway. People will expect you to know it. 

Well, that was ha lf the period, and in the rema ining half, you're going to stay a long 
time today. Okay, no, don't panic. I have to extend the Fourier series. Okay, let me 
give you the hurry up version indicating the two ways in which it needs to be 
extended. Extension number one -- The period is not two pi, but two times, I'll keep 
the two just to make the formulas look as similar as possible to the old ones. The 
period, let's say, instead of two pi, is 2L. 

Now, I think you know enough mathematics by this point to sort of, I hope you can 
sort of shrug and say, well, you know,  isn't that just kind of  like changing the units 
on the t-axis? You're just stretching. Yeah, right. All you do is make a change of 
variable. Now, should we make it nicely? I think I'll give you the final answer, and 
then I'll try to decide while I'm writing it down how much I'll try to make the 
argument. 

First of all, the main thing to get is, if the period is not p i but L, what are the natural 
versions of the cosine and sine to use? Use the natural functions. Natural has no 
meaning, but it's psycholog ically important. In other words, what kind of function 
should  rep lace that? I'll certa inly have a t here. What do I put  in front? I'll keep the n 
also. The question is, what do I fix? What should I put here in between in order to 
make the thing come out, so that it has period 2L? You probably should learn to do 
this formally as well as just sort of psyching it out, and taking a guess, or 
memoriz ing the answer. If this is the t-axis, here is t and L, zero and L. 

What you want to do is make a change of variab le to the u-axis where the axis is the 
same. This is still the point. But, L, now, on the u coordinate, has the name p i. Now, 

so I'm just describ ing a change of variable on the axis. What's the one that does 
this? Well, when t is L, u should be p i. So, t = L / pi. When u  is pi,  t is L, and vice 
versa. How about expressing u in terms, well, then u = pi/L * t. That's the 
backwards form of writing it, or the forward  form, depend ing upon how you like to 
think of these things. 

Okay, so the cosine should be pi over L times t,  in order that when t be L, it should 
be like cos(n pi), which is what we would have had. So, if t = L, in other words, 
where is this from? What am I trying to say? That's the function. This one is probab ly 
a little easier to see. Where is this one zero? The sine functions that we used before 
was zero at zero p i, two pi, three pi. Where is this one zero? It's zero at zero. When t 
= L, it's zero. When t = 2L, so,  this is the right thing. 

So, it's zero. It's period ic, and it's zero plus or minus L plus or minus 2L. And, in fact, 
forma lly you can verify that it's period ic w ith period 2L. So, in other words, we want 
a Fourier expansion to use these functions as the natura l analog of what would be up 
there. So, the period of our function is 2L, and the formula is, I'll give you the 
formula. It's f(t) equals identical summation, an, except you'll use these as the 
natural functions instead of cos(nt) and sin(nt). So, n pi t / L plus bn, okay, I'm 
tired, but I'll put it in anyway, n pi t / L. 

Yeah, but of course, what about the formulas for an? Somebody up there is watching 
over us. Here are the formulas. They are exactly what you would guess  if somebody 
said produce the formulas in ten seconds, and you'd better be right, and you d idn't 
have time to ca lculate. You say, well,  it must be, let's do the cosine series. Okay, 
let's not do a cosine. So,  it's 1 / L times the integral from negative L, in other words, 
wherever you see an L, wherever you see a pi, just put an L times the f of t cosine, 
and now we'll use our new function, not the old one. I submit that's an easy, if you 
know the first formula, then this would be an easy one to remember. All you do  is 
change pi to L everywhere. 

Except, you got to remember this part. Make it a function period ic of period 2L, not 
2pi. And similarly, bn is similar. It looks just the same way. And, how about, and the 
same even-odd business goes, too, so that if f(t), for example,  is even, and has 
period 2L, then the function, then the best formula for the an w ill not be that one. It 
will be two over L, and where you integrate only from zero to L, f of t cosine. 

So, now,  the bn's w ill be zero, and you'll just have positive, etc. for L. As I say, this 
is important case, particularly if the period is two, in other words, if the half period is 
one because  in the literature,  frequently one is used as the standard normal 
reference, not pi. P i is convenient mathematica lly because it makes the cosines and 
sines look simple. But, in actual calculation, it tends to be where L is one. So, usually 
you have a p i here. You don't have just nt. Well, I should do a calculation, but 
instead of doing that, let me give you the other extension. Fortunately, there are 
plenty of calculations in your book. 

So, let me give you in the last couple of minutes the other extension. This is going  to 
be a very important one for us next time. Typica lly, in applications, well, I mean, the 
first thing, period ic functions are nice, but let's face it. Most functions aren't period ic, 
I have to agree. So, all this theory is just about period ic functions? No. It's about 
functions. Really, it's about functions where the  interva l on which you are interested 
in them is finite. It's a  finite interva l, not functions which go to infinity. For those, 
you will have to use Fourier transforms, Fourier transforms, not Fourier series. 

But,  if you are  interested in a function on a finite interval, then you can use Fourier 
series even though the function isn't periodic because you can make it period ic. So, 
what you do is, if f(t) is on, let's take the interval from zero to L. That's a sample 
finite interva l. I can a lways change the variable to make the interval from zero  to L. I 
can even make it from zero to one, but that's a little too specia l. It would be a  little 
awkward. 

So, if a  function is defined on a finite interval, the way to app ly the Fourier series to 
it is make a periodic extension. Now, since I have so  little time, I'm just going to get 
away with murder by just drawing p ictures. So,  let me g ive you a function. Here's 
my function defined on zero to L, colored chalk if you p lease. Let's make it the 
function t^2, and let's make L equal to one. That function is not periodic. If I let it go 
off, it would just go off to infinity and never repeat its values, except on the left-
hand side. But, I'm not even going to  let it be on the left hand side. It's only defined 
from zero to one as far as I'm concerned. Okay, that function has an even periodic 
extension. 

And, its graph looks like this extended to be an even function. Okay, now,  that 
means from 0 --> -L, you've got to make it look exactly as it looked on the right-
hand side. Otherw ise,  it would be even. And now, what do I do? Well, now I've got, 
from -L --> L. So, all I'm a llowed to do  is keep  repeating the va lues. In other words, 
apply the theory of Fourier series to this guy, use a cosine series because it's an 
even function, and then everything you want to do, you say, okay, all the rest of this 
is garbage. I only rea lly care about  it from here to here. And, that's what you will 
plug into your d ifferential equation on the right-hand side, just that part of it, just 
this part of it. 

How about the odd extension? What would that  look like? Okay, the odd extension, 
here I start like this. And now, to extend it to be an odd function, I have to make it 
go down in exactly the same way it went up. And, what do I do here? I have to make 
it start repeating its values so it will look like this. So, the odd extension is going to 
be d iscontinuous in this case. And, what's the Fourier series going to converge to? 
Well, in each case, to the average, to the midpoint of the jump, and the odd 
extension looks like this, and this will give me assigned series. Okay, you've got lots 
of problems to do.
