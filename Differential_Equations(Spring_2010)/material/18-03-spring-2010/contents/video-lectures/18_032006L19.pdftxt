18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 19 

Today, and for the next two weeks, we are going to be studying what, for many 
eng ineers and a few scientists is the most popular method of solving any d ifferential 
equation of the kind that they happen to be, and that is to use the popular machine 
called the Lap lace transform. Now, you will get proficient in using it by the end of the 
two weeks. But, there is a lways a certain amount of mystery that hangs around it. 
Peop le scratch their heads and can't figure out where it comes from. And, that 
bothers them a lot. In the past, I've usua lly promised to tell you, the students at the 
end of the two weeks, but I almost never have time. So, I'm going to break that 
glorious tradition and tell you up front at the beginning, where it comes from, and 
then talk very fast for the rest of the period. 

Okay, a good way of thinking of where the Laplace transform comes from, and a way 
which I think dispels some of its mystery is by thinking of power series. I think 
virtually all of you have studied power series except possibly a  few students who just 
had 18.01 here last semester, and probably shouldn't be taking 18.03 anyway, now. 
But anyway, a power series looks like this: Sum( (a)n x^n). 

And, you sum that from, let's say, zero to infinity. And, the typ ica l thing you want to 
do with it is add it up to find out what its sum is. Now,  the only way I w ill depart 
from tradition, instead of ca lling the sum some generic name like f(x), in order to 
identify the sum with the coefficients, a, I'll call  it a(x). Now, I want to make just one 
slight change in that. I want to use computer notation, which doesn't use the 
subscript (a)n. Instead, this, it thinks of as a function of the discreet variable, n. In 
other words, it's a  function which assigns to n equals zero, one, two, three real 
numbers. That's what this sequence of coefficients really is. So, the computer 
notation w ill look almost the same. 

It's just that I w ill write this in functional notation as a(n) instead of (a)n. But, it still 
means the real number associated w ith the positive integer, n, and everything else is 
the same. See, what I'm thinking of this as doing is taking this d iscreet function, 
which gives me the sequence of coefficients of the power series, and associating that 
with the sum of the power series. Let me give you some very simp le examp les, two 
very simp le examples, which I think you know. Suppose this is a function one. Now, 
what do I mean by that? I mean it's the constant function, one. To every positive 
integer, it assigns the number one. Okay, what's a(x)? What I'm saying is, in other 
words, in this fancy, mystifying form, is a ll of these guys are one, what's a of x? 

1 + x + x^2 + x^3. Look, you are supposed to be born knowing what that adds up 
to. It adds up to 1/(1 - x), except that's the wrong answer. What's wrong about it? 
It's not true for every value of x. That's only true when x is such that that series 
converges, and that is only true when -1 < x < 1. 

So, it's not this function. It's this function with its doma in restricted to be less than 
one  in absolute value. What does that converge to? If x > 1, the answer is it doesn't 
converge. There's nothing else you can put here. Okay, let's take another function. 

Suppose this is, let's see, 1/n you probab ly won't know. Let's take one you will know, 
1 / n! . Suppose a(n) = 1 / n! , what's a(x)? So, what I'm asking is, what does this 
add up to when the coefficient here is 1 / n! ? What's Sum[x^n / n!]? It is e^x. And, 
this doesn't have to be qualified because this is true for a ll values of x. 

So, in other words,  from this peculiar point of view, I think of a power as summing 
the operation, of summing a power series as taking a discreet function defined for 
positive integers, or nonnegative integers, and doing this funny process. And, out of 
it comes a continuous function of some sort. And, notice what goes in is the variable, 
n. But, what comes out is the variab le, x. Well, that's perfectly natura l. 

That's the way a power series is set up. So, the question I ask is,  this is a d iscreet 
situation, a discreet summation. Suppose I made the summation continuous instead 
of discreet. So, I want the continuous analog of what I did over there. Okay, what 
would a continuous analog be? Well, instead of, I'll replace n zero, one, two, that will 
be replaced by a continued, that's a d iscreet variable. 

I'll replace it by a continuous variable, t, which runs from zero to infinity, and is 
allowed to take every real va lue in between instead of being only allowed to take the 
values of the positive nonnegative integers. Okay, well, if I want to use t instead of 
n, I clearly cannot sum in the usual way over all rea l numbers. But, the way the 
procedure which rep laces summation over all real numbers is integration. So, what 
I'm going to do is rep lace that sum by the integral from zero to infinity. That's like 
the sum from zero to  infinity of what? Well, of some function, but now n is being 
replaced by the continuous variab le, t. So, this is going to be a function of t. 

And, how about the rest of it? The rest I w ill just copy, x to the n'th. Well, instead of 
n I have to write t and dt. And, what's the sum? Well, I'll ca ll the sum, what's the 
sum a  function of? I integrate out the t. So, that doesn't appear in the answer. All 
that appears is this number, x, this parameter, x. For each va lue of x, like one, two, 
or 26.3,  this integra l has a certain value, and I can calculate it. So, this is going to 
end up as a function of x, just as it d id before. 

Now, I could leave it in that form, but no mathematician would like to do that, and 
very few engineers either. The reason is, in general, when you do integration and 
differentiation, you do not want to have as the base of an exponential something like 
x. The only convenient thing to have is e, and the reason  is because it's only e that 
people really like to differentiate, e to the something. The only thing is that people 
really like to differentiate or integrate. So, I'm going to make this look a little better 
by converting x^t to the base e. I remember how to do that. You write x = e^(ln x) 
and so x^t will be e^(ln x) * t, if you want. 

Now, the only problem is I want to make one more little change. After all, I want to 
be ab le to ca lculate this integral. And, it's clear that if t is going to infinity, if I have a 
number here,  for examp le, like x equals two, that integral is rea lly quite unlikely to 
converge. For example, if a(t) were just the constant function, one, the integra l 
certainly wouldn't converge. It would be horrible. That integral only has a chance of 
converging if x is a number less than one, so that when I take bigger and bigger 
powers of it, I get smaller and sma ller numbers. 

Don't forget, this is an  improper integral going a ll the way up to infinity. Those need 
treatment, delicate hand ling. All right, so I rea lly want x < 1. Otherw ise, that integral 
is very unlikely to converge. I'd better have it positive, because if I a llow it to be 

negative I'm going to get into trouble with negative powers, see what's minus one, 
for examp le, to the one ha lf when t is one half. 

That's already imag inary. I don't want that. If you've got an exponentia l, the base 
has got to be a positive number. So, I want x to be a positive number. All right, if x 
in my actual practices going to lie between zero and one  in order to make the 
integral converge, how about  log x? Well,  log x,  if x < 1, so ln(x) < 0, and it's going 
to go a ll the way down to negative infinity. 

So, this means log x is negative. In this interesting range of x, the log x is a lways 
going to be negative. And now, I don't like that. The first place I'd like to call this by 
a new variab le since no one uses log x as a variable. And, it would make sense to 
make it a negative,  to make  it negative, that is,  to write log x is equa l to negative s. 
Let's put it on the other side, in order that since log x is a lways going to be less than 
zero, then s will always be positive. 

And it's always more convenient to work w ith positive numbers instead of negative 
numbers. So, if I make those changes, what happens to the integral? Well, I stress, 
all these changes are just cosmetic to make things a little easier to work with in 
terms of symbols. First of all, the a I'm going to change. I don't want to call it a(t) 
because most people don't ca ll functions a of t. They call them f(t). So, I'll ca ll it f of 
t. x = e^( ln x) = e^(-s). 

So, x has its name changed to e^(-s). In other words, I'm using as the new variab le 
not x any longer but s in order that the base be e. t, I now ra ise this to the t'th 
power, but by the laws of exponents, that means I simp ly multiply the exponent by 
t, and dt. And now, since I'm calling the function f(t), the output ought to be called 
capital F. But it's now a function, since I've changed the variable, of s. It's no longer 
a function of x. If you like, you may think of this as a of, what's x? x = e^(-s), I 
guess. I mean, no one would leave a function in that form. It's simply a  function of s. 
And, what  is that? So, what have we got,  finally? What we have, dear hearts, is this 
thing, which I stress is nothing more than the continuous analog of the summation of 
a power series. 

This is the discrete version. This is by these perfectly natural transformations the 
continuous version of the same thing. It starts with a function defined for positive 
values of t, and turns it into a  function of s. And, this is called the Laplace transform. 
Now, if I've done my work correctly, you should all be saying, oh, is that all? But, I 
know you aren't. So, it's okay. You'll get used to it. 

The first thing you have to get used to is one thing some people never get used to, 
which is you put in a function of t, and you get out a  function of s. How could that 
be? You know, for an operator, you put  in 3x, and you get out three if it's a 
differentiation operator. In other words, when you have an operator, the things 
we've been ta lking about the last two or three weeks in one form or another, at least 
the variab le doesn't get changed. Well, but for a transform it does, and that's why 
it's ca lled a transform. So, the d ifference between a transform and an operator is 
that for a transform a function of t comes in, but a function of s comes out. 

The variab le gets changed, whereas for an operator, f(t) goes in and what comes out 
is g(t), a function using the same variable like differentiation  is a typical example of 
an operator, or the  linear differential operators we've been ta lking about. Well, but 

this doesn't behave that way. The variable does get changed. That's, in fact, 
extremely important in the applications. 

In the applications, t usually means the time, and s very often, not always, but very 
often is a variable measuring  frequency,  for instance. But, so that's a peculiar thing 
that's hard to get used to. But, a good thing is the fact that  it's a linear transform. In 
other words, it obeys the laws we'd love and like that the Laplace transform-- oh, I 
never gave you any notation  for the laplace transform. 

Hey, I'd better do that. Okay, so, some notation: there are two notations that are 
used. Your book mostly uses the notation that the L(f(t)) = F(s), uses the same 
letter but with the same cap ita l. Now, as you w ill see, there are some p laces you 
absolutely cannot use that notation. It may seem strange, looks perfectly natural. 
There are certa in laws you cannot express using that notation. 

It's baffling. But, if you can't do it this way, you can do it using this notation instead. 
One or the other will almost always work. So, I'll use my little squigg ly notation, but 
that's what I use. I think it's a little more vivid, and the trouble is that this p iles up 
too many parentheses. And, that's always hard  to read. So, I like this better. So, 
these are two a lternate ways of saying the same thing. 

The Laplace transform of this function is that one. Okay, well,  let's use,  for the 
linearity law, it's definitely best. I really cannot express the linearity law using the 
second notation, but using the first notation, it's a breeze. The Laplace transform of 
the sum of two functions is the sum of their Laplace transforms of each of them 
separately. Or, better yet, you could write it that way. Let's write it this way. That 
way, it looks more  like an operator, L(f) + L(g). And, of the same way, if you take a 
function and multip ly it by a constant and take the lap lace transform, you can pull 
the constant outside. And, of course, why are these true? These are true just 
because of the form of the transform. If I add up f and g, I simp ly add up the two 
corresponding integrals. 

In other words, I'm using the fact that the integral, this definite  integral,  is itself a 
linear operator. Well, that's the general setting. That's where it comes from, and 
that's the notation for it. And, now we have to get to work. The first thing to do to 
get familiar with this is, obviously what we want to do is say, okay, these were the 
transforms of some simple discreet functions. Okay, suppose I put  in some familiar 
functions,  f(t). What do their Laplace transforms look like? So, let's do that. So, one 
of the boards I should keep stored. Why don't I store on this board? I'll store on this 
board the formulas as we get them. 

So, let's see, what should we aim at, first? Let's first find, and I'll do the calculations 
on the sideboard, and we'll see how it works out. I'm not very sure. In other words, 
what's the Laplace transform of the function, one? Well, there's an even easier one. 
What's the Laplace transform of the function zero? Answer: zero. Very exciting. 
What's the Laplace transform of one? Well, it doesn't turn out the constant anymore 
than it turned out to be a constant up there. Let's ca lculate  it. Now, you can do these 
calculations carefully, dotting all the i's, or pretty carefully, or not carefully at all, i.e. 
slopp ily. I'll let you be sloppy after, genera lly speaking, you could be sloppy unless 
the d irections tell you to be less sloppy or to be careful, okay? 

So, I'll do one carefully. Let's ca lculate the Lap lace transform of one carefully. Okay, 
in the beg inning, you've got nothing to use with the definition. So, I have to 

calculate the integral from zero to infinity of one, that's the f(t) e^(-st), so I don't 
have to put in the one, dt. All right, now, let me remind you, this is an improper 
integral. This is just about the first time in the course we've had an improper 
integral. But, there are going to be a lot of them over the next coup le of weeks, 
nothing but. 

All right, it's an improper integra l. That means we have to go back to the definition. 
If you want to be careful, you have to go back to the definition of improper integra l. 
So, it's the limit, as R goes to infinity, of what you get by integrating only up as far 
as R. That's a definite integra l. That's a nice Riemann integral. So, this is what I have 
to ca lculate. And, I have to take the limit as R goes to infinity. Now, how do I 
calculate that? Well, this integra l is equa l to, that's easy. It's just integrating. 
Remember that you're integrating w ith respect to t. So, s is a parameter. It's like a 
constant,  in other words. So, it's e^(-st), and when I d ifferentiated, the derivative of 
this would have negative s. So, to get rid of that negative s, so the derivative is e^(-
st). You have to put -s in the denominator. 

And now, I'll want to evaluate that between zero and R. And, what do I get? Well it is 
at the upper limit. So, it's e to the minus s times R minus, at the lower limit, it's t is 
equa l to zero, so whatever s is, it's one. And that's divided by this constant up front, 
negative s. So, the answer is, it is equa l to the limit of, as R goes to infinity, of (e^(-
sR) - 1) / (-s). 

Now, what's that? Well, as R goes to infinity, e^(-2R), or minus 5R goes to zero, and 
the answer is -1 / -s. So, that's 1/s. And so, that's our answer. Let's put it up here. 
It's one over s, except it isn't. I made a mistake. Well, not mistake, a little oversight. 
What's the oversight? This is okay. This is okay. This is okay. This is not okay. This is 
okay. But that's not okay. What's wrong? 

I d id slight a verbal hand. Maybe some of you have p icked it up and were too 
embarrassed to correct me, but I said like e^(-2R) obviously goes to zero, and e^(-
5R) goes to zero. How about e^(-(-3)R)? Does that go to zero? No, that's e^(3R), 
which goes to infinity. The only time this goes to zero is if s is a positive number. 
Minus s looks like a negative number, but it's not, if s is equa l to minus two. So, this 
is only true if s is positive because only if s is positive  is this exponent rea lly negative 
and large, and therefore going to  infinity, going to zero as R goes to infinity. So, the 
answer is not 1/s. It is one over s, s must positive. 

Now, once aga in, here, peop le don't worry about this sort of thing w ith power series 
because it seems very obvious, you know, 1/x, |x| < 1, when it gets to be the 
Laplace transform, just because the Laplace transform is mysterious, the question is, 
okay, the Laplace transform is one over s of one, well, Laplace transform of one I 
understand is one over s if s is positive. 

What is it if s is negative? Okay, right down in your little books, this, but that down, 
what is it if s is negative, and write underneath that, this question  is meaning less. It 
doesn't mean anything. I'll draw you a p icture. This is a p icture of the Lap lace 
transform of one. It is that. It's one branch of this curve. It does not include the 
branch on the left. It doesn't because I showed you it doesn't. That's all there is to it. 
Okay, so I did that carefully. Now I'm going to get a little  less careful. What's the 
L(e^(at))? First of a ll, in general, the kind of functions for which people like to 
calculate the Laplace transform, and basically the only ones there will be in the 

tables are exactly the sort of functions that you used in solving linear equations with 
constant coefficients. 

What kinds of functions entered in there? Exponentials, sines and cosines, but they 
were really comp lex exponentia ls, right? e^t sin(t), but that was rea lly a complex 
exponentia l, too, just a little more comp licated one, polynomials, and that's about it. 
t e^t, that was okay, too. These are the functions for which people ca lculate the 
Laplace transform, and a ll the other functions they don't calculate the Laplace 
transforms. So, I don't mean to d isappoint you here. You're going to say, oh, what, 
that same old stuff? For two more weeks, we've got that same, well, the Laplace 
transform does a lot of things much better than the methods we've been using. 

And, I won't. I'll sell it when I get a chance to, for now, let's just get familiar with it. 
All right, so while I'm not going to ca lculate e^(at) for you, because I'd like instead 
to just prove a simp le formula which will just give that, and will also give us e^(at) 
sin(t). It w ill g ive us a  lot more, instead. I'm going to calculate a formula for the 
Laplace transform of this guy if you a lready know the Lap lace transform of it. 

Now, see, this falls in that category because this is really e^(at)*1. But, I already 
know the Lap lace transform of one. So that's, if I can get a genera l formula  for this, 
I'll be able to get the formula for e^(at) as a consequence. So, let's look for this 
Laplace transform. Now, it's rea lly easy. Let's see, where am I doing calculations? 
Over here. 

Okay, so we've got e. So, I want to calculate the L(e^(at) f(t)). So I'm going to say 
that's the integral from zero to infinity of e^(at) f(t). And now, the rest I copy. That's 
the function part of it that goes to the input, and then there's the other part. This 
part is ca lled the kernel, by the way, but don't worry about that. 

However, if you drop it in conversation, peop le will look at you and say, gee, they 
know something I don't. And you w ill. You know that it's the kernel. Okay, well, now, 
what kind of formula can I be looking for? C learly, I can only be looking for a formula 
which expresses it in terms of the L(f(t)). Let's calculate and see what we get. Now, 
what would you do to that thing to make? Well, obviously, the thing to do is to 
combine the two exponentials. So, that's going to be the integra l from zero to  infinity 
of f(t). e, now, I'd like to put it,  to combine the exponentia ls in such a way that  it 
has, still,  that same form, so, I'm going to beg in with that negative sign, and then 
see what the rest of it has to be. What is it going to be? 

Well, -st and +at, but I can make that minus a here, and it w ill come out right. So, 
it's -st + at, and there are the two parts, those two factors, dt. So, what's that? 
That's the Lap lace transform. If the a weren't there, this would be the Lap lace 
transform of f of t. What is it with the a there? It's the L(f(t)), except that instead of 
the variab le, s --> s - a. I'll give you a second to digest that. Well, you d igest it while 
I'm writing it because that's the answer. 

And, the way this is most often used, I have to qualify it for the value. So, if F(s) is 
good for s positive, the way it would be, for example, if I used the function one here, 
then to  finish that off, then, F(s - a) will be, this will be good when s > a. Why is 
that? Well, because this is true. This is true. If s - a is positive, that's the condition. 
That's what this Lap lace transform is good. But that simply says that s > a. And, 
since this doesn't look pretty, let me try to make it look a little bit prettier. So, let's 
write it. 

So, this  is assuming F(s), s > 0. Now, this is called something. This is ca lled, well, 
what would you call it? On the left side, you multiply by an exponential. On the right, 
you translate. You shift the argument over by a. So, this is ca lled, gulp, the 
exponentia l shift. What? Well, I'll call  it the formula. The thing before, when we 
talked about operators, we called it the exponential shift rule or the exponentia l shift 
law. But, in  fact, this  is, in a way, a d isguised form of the same law. And, engineers 
who typ ically do all their work using the Laplace transform and don't use operators, 
this is the form of the exponentia l shift law that they would know. 

What you can do w ith one, you can do w ith the other. You can now use both. So, 
what's the answer to e^(at)? Well, the answer is, I'm supposed to, e to  the a t times 
one, the Laplace transform of one  is 1/s. And, therefore, what I do is to multiply by e 
to the a t, I change s --> s - a. And so, that's the answer. Let's see, what else don't 
we know? 

Well, how about sines and cosines? Well, the way to do sines and cosines is by 
making the observation that this formula a lso works when a is a complex number. 
So, can use also  for a a comp lex number, for e^((a + b i)t). The L(e^((a + b i)t)) = 1 
/ (s - (a + bi)). And aga in, it w ill be for s > a. So, let's calculate the Lap lace 
transform of, let's say, well, I've got to cover up something. Okay, so, that's the 
Laplace transform. I've got to remember that. 

So, let's ca lculate the Laplace transform of, let's say, sin(at) and cos(at). What do 
you get for that? Well, just for a little variety, we could do it by using that formula, 
and taking its rea l and imag inary parts. Since some of you had so much difficulty 
with the backwards Euler formula, he is a good case where you could use it. Suppose 
you want to calculate the Laplace transform of cos(at). 

Well, I'm going to write that using, I want to calculate using comp lex exponentials. 
The way I w ill do it is by using the backwards Euler formula. So, this is (e^(iat) + 
e^(-iat)) / 2. Remember, the foreword Euler formula would say e^(iat) = cos(at) +  i 
sin(at). That expresses the complex exponential in terms of sines and cosines. This is 
the backward  formula, which just read it backwards, expressing cosines and sines in 
terms of complex exponentials instead. Both formulas are useful, a lmost equa lly 
useful,  in fact. And anyway, just remind you of it, let's use this one. Okay, what's the 
Laplace transform,  then, of cos(at)? 

Well, by linearity,  it's equal to one half the Laplace transform of this guy plus the 
Laplace transform of that guy. And, what are those? Well, the L(e^(iat)) = 1 / (s -
ia), and the Laplace transform of the other guy  is 1 / (s + ia). Now, of course, this 
has become out to be a rea l function. This is rea l. Every  integral is rea l. This must 
come out to be real. This  looks kind of comp lex, but it isn't. I know automatically 
that this is going to be a real function. How I know that? Well, menta lly, you can 
combine the terms and calculate. But, I know even before that. Remember, there 
are two ways to see that something is real. You can ca lculate it and see that its 
imaginary part is zero, hack, or w ithout any calculation,  if you change i --> - i, and 
you get the same thing, it must be rea l. 

Now, if I change  i to minus i in this expression, what happens? If I change i to minus 
i, this term turns into that one, and this one turns into that one. Conclusion: the sum 
of the two is unchanged. And therefore, this is real. Well, of course, in the time I 
took to make that argument, I could have actually ca lculated it. So, what the heck, 

let's calculate it? So, you do the high school thing, and it's this guy p lus that guy on 
top, which makes 2s. I on the bottom is the product of those, which by now you 
should know the product of two complex numbers. A product of a number and its 
complex conjugate is the sum of the squares. 

So, what's the answer? The twos cancel, and the answer is that the L(cos(at)) = s / 
(s^2 + a^2). And, that w ill be true as, in general, it's true up there for positive 
values of s only. And, the sin(at) , you can calculate that in recitation tomorrow. The 
answer to that is a / (s^2 + a^2). You would get the same answers  if you took the 
real and imaginary parts of that expression. 

It's another way of getting at the recitations tomorrow; we'll get practice in 
calculating other functions related to these by using  these formulas, and a lso from 
scratch d irectly from the definition of the Lap lace transform. Well, there are two 
things which we still should do. The first is I want to get you started w ith calculating 
inverse Lap lace transforms. And, the reason for doing that is, in other words, I've 
started with f(t), and we've been focusing on what is capita l F(s)? But, you will find 
that when you go to solve differentia l equations, by far, the hardest part of the 
procedure  is you get F of s. The Laplace transform of the answer, and you have to 
convert that back into the answer in terms of t that you were looking for. In other 
words, the ma in step in the procedure that you are going to be using for solving 
differentia l equations is, and the hardest part of the step will be to ca lculate  inverse 
laplace transforms. 

Now, you think that could be done by tables, but, in fact, it can't unless the tables 
are too long to be useful. You have to do a certa in amount of work yourself. And, the 
certain amount of work that you have to do yourself involves partial fractions 
decompositions. And, in case you were wondering which you are not, the reason you 
learned partia l fractions in 18.01 was not to learn those silly integra ls, but he learned 
it so  that when you got to 18.03 you would be able to calculate, solve d ifferential 
equations by using Laplace transforms. Sorry. That's life. Now, so a certain amount 
of the recitation time tomorrow w ill be devoted to reminding you how to do partia l 
fractions since you haven't done it in a while, and I assume, yeah, we had that, I 
think. 

Okay, now, they a lso remind you of the most efficient method, which about half of 
you have had, and the rest think you might have had, but really aren't sure. So, 
here's the answer. We want to find out what it's inverse Laplace transform is. What 
you have to do, it norma lly won't be in the tables like this. You have to put it in a 
form in which it will be in the tables. As you do that, you have to make partial 
fractions decompositions, which, to do it quickly, so if you don't know what I'm doing 
now, or you think you once knew but don't quite remember, go to recitation 
tomorrow. To get the coefficient here, I cover up s, and  I put s = 0 because that's 
the law. 

To get this coefficient, I cover up s p lus three and I put s equals a negative three 
because that's what you're supposed to do. Put s equal negative three, you get 
minus one third. This is equal to that. In this form, I don't know what the inverse 
Laplace form is, but in this form, I certainly do know w ith the inverse Laplace 
transform because the inverse Laplace transform is linear, and because each of these 
guys especially occurs  in those tab les. Well, what's this? 

Well, it's whatever the Lap lace transform of, inverse Laplace transform of one over s 
is multiplied by one third. Well, the inverse Laplace transform of one over s is one. 
So, it's one third times one. How about the other guy? Minus one third, the inverse 
Laplace transform of one over s p lus three, that's this formula. a is negative three, 
and that makes e^(-3t). So,  if this was the Lap lace transform of the solution to the 
differentia l equation, then the solution in terms of t was this function. Now, you'll get 
lots of practice in that. All I'm doing now is signaling that that's the most important 
and difficult step of the procedure, and that, p lease, start getting practice. 

Get up to snuff doing that procedure. Okay, in the time remaining, I want to add one 
formula to this list, and that is going to be the Laplace transform of, we still haven't 
done polynomials. And now, to polynomia ls, because the Laplace transform is linear, 
all I have to do is know what the Lap lace transform of, the individual term of a 
polynomial. In other words, what the L(t^n), where n  is some positive integer? Well, 
let's bravely start trying to ca lculate it. Integral from 0 to infinity of [t^n e^(-st) dt]. 
Now, I think you can see that the method you should use is integration by part 
because this is a product of two things, one of which you would like to differentiate a 
lot of times, in fact, and the other won't hurt to  integrate it because it's very easy to 
integrate. . 

So, this factor is going to be the one that's to be differentiated, and this is the factor 
that will be p leased to integrate it. Let's get started and see what we can get out of 
it. Well, this time I'm going to be, well, I'd better be a little careful because there's a 
point here that's tricky. Okay, the first step of integration by parts is you only do the 
integration. You don't do the differentiation. Remember, the variab le is t. The s is 
just a parameter. It's just a constant. It's hanging around, not knowing what to do. 
Okay, so the first step is you don't do the differentiation. You only do the integration. 
Evaluate it between  limits, and then you put a minus sign before you  forget to do it. 

And then, integral zero to infinity. Now you do both operations. So,  it's n t^(n-1), 
and you also do the integration. Okay, let's consider each of these pieces in turn. 
Now, this piece, well, there's no problem with the lower limit, zero, because when t 
is equal to zero, this factor is zero, and the thing disappears as long as n is one or 
higher. So,  it's minus zero here at the lower limit. The question is, what is at the 
upper limit? So, what I have to do  is find out, what is the limit? The limit, as t goes 
to infinity, that's what's happening up there, of t^n e^(-st) / (-s). 

Well, as t goes to infinity, this goes to infinity, of course. This had better go to zero 
unless I want an answer, infinity, which won't do me any good. If this goes to zero, s 
had better be positive. So, I'd better be restricting myself to that case. Okay, so let's 
assume that s is positive so that this minus s really is a negative number. Okay, then 
I have a chance. So, this is going to be the limit. Let's write it in a more familiar form 
with that down below. So,  it's t^n. That's going  to infinity. But, the bottom is e^(-
st). But now, it's +st. And, that's going to  infinity, too, because s is positive. So, the 
two guys are racing, and the question is, oh, I lost a minus s here. So, oh, [GRUNTS] 
equa ls -1 / s. How's that? 

So, the question is only, which guy w ins? In the race to infinity, which one wins, and 
how do you decide? And, the answer, of course, is that's the bottom that wins. The 
exponentia l a lways wins, and it's because of L 'Hopita l's rule. You d ifferentiate top 
and bottom. Nothing much happens to the bottom. It gets another factor of s, but 
the top goes down to t^(n - 1). L'Hopital it aga in, and aga in, and again, and aga in, 

and again until finally you've reduced the top to t to the zero where it's defenseless 
and just sitting there, and nothing's happened to the bottom. 

It's still got e^(st), and that goes to  infinity. So, the answer is, this is zero by n 
applications of L'Hopital's rule. Or, if you're very clever, you can do it in one, but I 
won't tell you how. So, the answer is that this is zero. At the upper limit, it's also 
zero at least if s is positive, which is the case we're considering. That  leaves the rest 
of this. All right, let's pull the constants out front. That's p lus. Two negatives make a 
plus. n / s, now, what's left? Integral from 0 to infinity of [t^(n - 1) e^(-st) dt]. But, 
what on Earth is that? That is n/s times the Lap lace transform of t^(n-1). We got a 
reduction for it. We don't get the answer in one step. 

But, we get a reduction  formula. And, it says that the Laplace transform, let me write 
it this way for once. The first way is now better,  is equal to n over s times the 
Laplace transform of n minus t to the n / s * L(n - t^(n - 1)). Okay, the next step, 
this would be n / s * (n - 1) / s * L(t^(n - 2)). 

If I can continue, I finally get in the top n times n minus one times all the way down 
to one d ivided by the same number of s's, n of them, times the Lap lace transform of 
t to the zero, finally. See, one, zero, n minus one. And so, what's the final answer? It 
is n factoria l over s to the what power? Well, the Laplace transform of this is 1/s. So, 
the answer is it's s^(n + 1), n of them here p lus an extra one coming  from the one 
over s here. And, that's the answer. The L(t^n), oddly enough, is more complicated, 
and looks a little d ifferent from these. It's n! / (s^(n + 1)). And, with that, you can 
now ca lculate the Lap lace transform of anything in sight, and tomorrow you will.
