18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 33 

Today's  lecture  is going to be basica lly devoted to working out a single example of a 
nonlinear system, but it is a very good examp le because it illustrates three things 
which you rea lly have to know about nonlinear systems. I have indicated them by 
three cryptic words on the board, but you w ill see at different points in the lecture 
what they refer to. Each of these represents something you need to know about 
nonlinear systems to be ab le to effectively analyze them. In addition, I am not 
allowed to collect any more work, accord ing to the faculty rules, after today. And, of 
course, I won't. But, nonetheless, the final will conta in material from the read ing 
assignment G7, and I will be touching on all of these today, and 7.4, just a couple of 
pages of that. 

You will see its connection. It d iscusses the same examp le we are going to do today. 
And then I suggest those three exercises to try to solidify what the lecture is about. 
Instead of introducing the nonlinear system right away that we are going to talk 
about, I would like to  first exp lain, so that it won't interrupt the presentation later, 
what I mean by a conversion to a  first-order equation. 

For that why don't we look at -- Maybe I can do  it here. Our system  looks  like this, 
dx/dt. For once, I am not writing x' because I want to exp licitly ind icate what the 
independent variable is. It is a nonlinear autonomous system, so there is no t on the 
right-hand side. But this is not a simp le  linear function, ax + by. It is more 
complicated, like you had in the predator-prey robin-earthworm problem that you 
worked on last night. And the other equation w ill be g of (x, y). This is the system, 
and exp licitly it is nonlinear in general and autonomous, as I have ind icated on the 
right-hand side. 

Now, remember that the geometric p icture of this was as a velocity field. You made a 
velocity field out of the vectors whose components were f and g, so that is (f) i + 
(g)j, but what it looked like was a plane filled up with a lot of vectors pointing 
different ways accord ing to the velocity at the point was. And side-by-side w ith that 
went the solutions. A typical solution was x = x(t), y = y(t)  represented as a column 
vector. And that is a parametric equation. And the geometric p icture of that was 
given by  its trajectory. 

When you p lotted it, it was a trajectory. It had not only the right direction at each 
point, in other words, but it also had to have the right velocity at each point. In other 
words, sometimes the point was moving rapid ly and sometimes it was moving more 
slowly a long that path. And the way it moved was an important part of the solution. 
Now, what I plan to do is -- The conversation that I am talking about takes p lace by 
eliminating t. 

Now, why would one want to do that? t, after all, is an essential part of the solution. 
It is an essential part of this picture because without t you would not know how long 
the arrows were supposed  to be. You would still know their d irection. And, of course, 
it occurs in here. Now, let's take the first step and eliminate t from the system itself. 

As you see, that is very easy to do because the right-hand side has no t in it anyway 
and the left-hand side has the t only as the denominators of the d ifferential 
quotients. The obvious way to eliminate t  is just to divide one equation by the other. 
And since usually we think of not dx/dy, but dy/dx, I will vow --

What is dy over dx? Well, if I d ivide this equation by that equation, dy/dt / (dx/dt), 
accord ing to the chain rule, or accord ing to commonsense, you cancel the dt's and 
you get dy/dx. And, on the right-hand side, you get g of (x, y) divided by f of (x, y). 
But what is that? That is the equation of the first day of the term. By taking that 
sing le step, I convert this nonlinear system, which we virtually never find explicit 
solutions to,  into an ord inary first order equation which, in fact, you also don't 
usua lly find exp licit solutions to, except w ith our narrow blinders on. 

We only get problems at the beginning of 18.03 where there w ill be an exp licit 
solution to this. I have converted the nonlinear system to a single first order 
equation to which I can app ly the usual first order methods that include hope that I 
will be ab le to solve it. Now, what do I lose? Well, what happens to this picture? If 
you don't have the t in it anymore then you don't have velocity, you don't have 
arrows w ith a length to them because the length gives you how fast the point is 
going. Without t I don't know at any point how fast it is supposed to be going. All I 
know at any point (x, y) is no longer dx/dt and dy/dt. All I know is dy/dx. In other 
words, the corresponding picture, if I eliminate t from this picture a ll that is left is 
the d irections of each of these arrows. 

What disappears is their length. And, in  fact, since dy/dx is purely a slope, I cannot 
even tell whether the point is traveling this way or that way. It doesn't make any 
sense to have the point traveling anymore since there is no time in which it can do 
its traveling. So that p icture gets changed to the direction field. The corresponding 
picture now, all you do is take each of these arrows, you snip it off to a standard 
length, being careful to snip off the little pointy end, and it becomes nothing but a 
line element. And a ll it has is a slope. What corresponds to the velocity field here is 
now just our slope field or our d irection field. 

All we know is the slope at each point. How about the solution? Well, if I have 
eliminated time, the solution is no  longer a pair of parametric equations. It is just an 
equation involving x and y. I can hope that the solution will be explicit, y = y(x), but 
you already know from the first days of the term that sometimes it isn't. Let's call 
that exp licit solution. Often you have to settle for it. And sometimes it is not a pain. 
It is something that is even better. Settle for a solution which looks like this which is 
y defined implicitly as a  function of x. And what does the picture of that look like? 
Well, the picture of this is now simply an integra l curve. It is not a trajectory 
anymore. It is what we ca lled an integral curve. 

I am remind ing you of the very first day of the term, or maybe the second day. And 
all it has at each point the right slope because that is a ll the field is telling me now. It 
only has a slope at each point. It doesn't have any magnitude or direction. It has the 
direction, but it doesn't have direction in the sense of an arrow telling me whether it 
is going this way or the opposite way. That is the p icture with t in it. 

These are the correspond ing degeneration of that. It is a coarsening, it's a 
cheapening of it. It is throwing away information. Throw away a ll the information 
that had to do w ith t, and we are back in the first days of the terms with a single first 
order equations involving only x and y with solutions that involve only x and y with 

curves that are the graphs of these solutions but again have no t in them. In effect, 
they are just the paths of the trajectories. 

Whereas, the trajectory is the point that shows actually how the point is moving 
along in time faster or slower at various points. Now, why would one want to lose 
information? Well, the great ga in is that this might be solvable. Whereas, this almost 
certainly is not. That is a b ig p lus. For examp le, let's illustrate it on the very simplest 
possible case. I cannot illustrate it on a nonlinear system very well, or not right now 
because, in genera l, nonlinear systems are not solvab le. Let's take an easy example. 
Suppose the system were a linear one, let's say this one that we have talked about 
before,  in fact. That is a simp le linear two-by-two system. 

This means the derivatives with respect to time. Well, you know that the solutions 
we talked about in fact, last time, typ ical solutions that would be something like (x, 
y) equa ls a constant times, let's say if x = cos(t) then y would be the derivative of 
that, y = -sin(t). Or, another one would be c2 (sin(t), cos(t)). 

And those, of course, are circles. They are parametrized circles, so they are circles 
that go around, in fact, in this d irection. And they have a certa in velocity to them. 
Now what do I do if I follow this plan of eliminating t? Well, if I eliminate t d irectly 
from the system, what w ill I get? I w ill get dy/dx. I divide this equation by that one. 
-- is equa l to -x/y. Oh, well, of course, that is solvable. You were ab le to solve by 
18.01 methods before you ever come into this course. By separation of variables, it 
is y dy = -x dx, which integrates to be 1/2 y^2 = -1/2 x^2 + c. 

And after multiplying through by two and moving things around it becomes x^2 + 
y^2. The nicest way to say it is implicitly, x squared p lus y squared equals some 
positive constant. These are the circles. Now, can I eliminate t? I could a lso take one 
of these solutions and eliminate t. If I square this, the best way to do it is not to use 
our cosines and arcsines and whatnot, which w ill just get you tota lly lost. 

Square this, square that and add them together. And you conclude that x^2 + y^2 
= 1. Or, if c1 is not one it is equal to c1 squared. You could eliminate t from the 
solution the way you eliminate t from a pair of parametric equations, and you get it 
the same way that x^2 + y^2 = (c1)^2, I guess. 

In some sense, what we are doing is cycling around to the beginning of the term. In 
fact, this whole lecture, as you w ill see, is about cycles of one sort or another. But I 
keep thinking of that great line of poetry, "in my end is my beginning" or maybe it's 
"in my beg inning is my end". I think both lines occur. But that is what is happening 
here. This is the beg inning of the course and this is the end of the course, and they 
have this a lmost trivial relation between them. But notice the totally d ifferent 
methods used for analyzing this, where the t is included, than from ana lyzing this 
where there is no t. The goa ls are d ifferent, what you look for are different, 
everything is different, and yet it is a lmost the same problem. 

I promised you a nonlinear examp le. I guess it is time to see what that is. It is going 
to be another predator-prey equation, but one which is, in some ways, simpler than 
the one I gave you for homework. The predator is going to be x because you are 
used to that from the robins. I am keeping the same predator-prey variables. And 
the prey w ill be y. And now just notice the sma ll difference from what I gave you 
before. For one thing, I am not g iving you specific numbers. I am going  to, at the 
beginning at least, do some of the analysis at the beg inning using letters, using 

parameters. a, b, c, d are always going to be positive constants. I am going to 
assume that x' = -ax. 

This represents the predator dying out if there is no prey there, but if there is 
something to eat that term represents the predator meeting up w ith the prey and 
gobbling it up. And b is the coefficient. How about without predictors, the prey w ill 
multip ly and be fruitful. Unfortunately they get eaten, and so there will be a term 
that looks like this. Now, there are two basic differences between these simple 
equations and the slightly more complicated ones you had w ith the robin-earthworm 
equations. Namely, in the first place, I am assuming that these guys, let's g ive them 
names. I want you to remember which is x and which is y, so we are going to think 
of these are "sharx". [LAUGHTER] 

And these w ill be food fish, so let's make them "yumfish". The fact that w ith your 
robins you had a positive term here. I made this 2x. And now it is minus a times x. 
What is the difference? The difference  is that robins have other things to eat, so even 
if there are not any worms, a  rob in will survive. It could eat other insects, grubs, 
Japanese beetle grubs. I think it can even eat seeds. Anyway, the robins in my 
garden seem to be pecking at things that don't seem to be insects. And the other is 
that I am assuming a very naÃ¯ve growth law. For examp le, if there are no sharks, 
how are the food fish fruitful and multip lying? 

They multip le exponentia lly. Now, obviously you cannot have unlimited growth like 
that. W ith the worms we added the term minus a constant times y squared to 
indicate that even worms cannot multiply purely exponentially forever, but ultimately 
their growth levels off because they cannot find enough organic matter to plow their 
way through. Those are the two d ifferences. I am not assuming a logistic growth law. 
This is less sophisticated than the one I gave you for homework. This assumes that 
sharks have absolutely nothing to eat except these fish, which is not so bad. That's 
true, more or less. 

My p lan is now, w ith this model, let's start the analysis, as you learned to do it. And 
we are going to run into  trouble at various places. And the troubles will then 
illustrate these three points that I wanted to add to your repertoire of things to do 
with nonlinear systems when you run into  trouble. And it will also increase your 
understanding of the nonlinear systems. The first thing we have to do is find the 
critica l points. I am going to assume that you are good at this and, therefore, not 
spend a  lot of time detailing the calculations. 

I w ill simply write them on the board. The first equation I am going to write down is 
x(-a + by) = 0. And I assume you know why I am writing that down. And  the other 
equation w ill be y(c - dx) = 0. Those are the simultaneous equations I have to  find to 
find the critical point. The first one is  if the product of these is zero, either x is zero 
or the other factor is. So, from  the second equation, if x is zero, y has to be zero 
also. That is one critical point. Now, if x is not zero then this factor has to be zero 
which says that y = a/b. 

And if y is equa l to a over b, it is not zero here. Therefore, this factor must be zero 
which says that x = c/d. You see right away that this must be a simpler system 
because it is only producing two critical points. Whereas, the system that you did  for 
homework had four. Here is one. Well, let's just write them up here. The critica l 
points are zero, zero. That doesn't look terrib ly interesting, but the other one looks 
more interesting. It is (c/d)(a/b). 

Well, let's take a  look first at the zero, zero critical point. The origin, in other words. 
What does that look like? Well, at the orig in, the linearization is extremely easy to do 
because I simply ignore the quadratic terms, which are the product of two small 
numbers, where these only have a single small number in it. It  is minus ax, cy. In 
other words, the linearization matrix is (-a, 0; 0, c). Now, I don't think at any point I 
have ever explicitly told you that I hope you have learned from the homework or 
maybe your recitation teacher, but for heaven's sake, put this down in your little 
books, if you have a diagonal matrix, for god's sake, don't calculate its eigenvalues. 
They are right in front of you. 

They are a lways the d iagona l elements. The eigenvalue, you can check this out  if you 
insist on writing the equation, but trust me it is clear. If I, for example, subtract c 
from the main diagona l, I am going to get a determinant zero because the bottom 
row will be a ll zero. The eigenvalues are negative a and c. In other words,  they have 
opposite signs. This is a negative number. That is a positive number --

-- because a, b, c and d are a lways positive. And, therefore, this is automatically a 
saddle. You don't have to calculate anything. It is a ll right in  front of you. It must be 
a sadd le and, therefore, unstable because all saddles are. And, in  fact, you can even 
draw the little p icture of what the stuff looks like near the origin without even 
bothering to ca lculate eigenvectors, a lthough it is extremely easy to do. Just from 
common sense, these are the sharks and these are the yumfish. 

Well, if there are zero yumfish, in other words, if I am on the sharks axis, the axis of 
sharks, I d ie out. Well, forget about this side. It's on the positive side. That makes 
sense. But I d ie out because the sharks have nothing to eat. Whereas,  if I am on the 
yumfish axis I go this way. I grow because, w ithout any sharks to eat them, the 
yumfish increase. So it must look like that. And, therefore, the saddle must look like 
this. The saddle curves hug those and go nearby. Now,  the other critica l point is the 
interesting one. And for that the analysis, in order that you don't spend the rest of 
this period writing a's, b's, c's and d's, I am going to make the simplifying 
assumption. But it doesn't change qualitatively any of the mathematics. It just 
makes it a little easier to write everything out. I am going to assume that everything 
is one. 

Well, in  fact, even this would be good enough, but let's make everything one. I am 
going to assume this. And it is only to make the writing simpler. It doesn't rea lly 
change the mathematics at all. Well,  if everything is one, in order to ca lculate the 
linearized system, I'd better use the Jacobian. But perhaps it would be better to 
write out exp licitly what the system is. The system now is x' = -x + xy, a ll the 
coefficients are one. 

And y' = y - xy. What is the Jacob ian? Well, the Jacobian is the partial of this w ith 
respect to x which  is -1 + y,  the partial w ith respect to y which is x, the partial of 
this with respect to x, which is minus y, and the partia l w ith respect to y, which is 1 -
x. But I want to evaluate that at the point (1, 1), which is the critical point. It is the 
critica l point because I have assumed that all these parameters have the value one. 
And when I do that, eva luating it at (1, 1), I get what matrix? Well, I get (0, 1; -1, 
0). 

In other words, the linearized system is x' = y and y' = -x. Well, that  is just the one 
we analyzed before in terms of -- It's the one whose solutions are circles. In other 

words, what we find out is that the linearized system  is what geometric type? 
Saddle? Node? Spira l? None of those. It is a center. The linearized system is a 
center. 

It consists, in other words, of a bunch of curves going round and  round next to each 
other. Concentric circles, in  fact. Well, what is wrong w ith that? Now, we are in deep 
trouble. We are now in troub le because that is a borderline case. Let me remind you 
of what the borderline cases are. When we drew that picture, this is from last week's 
problem set so you have a perfect excuse for forgetting it totally. But I am trying to 
remind you of it. That is another reason why I am doing this. 

Remember that picture I asked you about that appeared on the computer screen? 
Let's make it a little flatter so that I can have room to write in. This is a certain 
parabola whose equation you are dying to tell me, but I am not asking. There  is the 
trace, this  is the determinant, and the characteristic equation is related to the values 
of these numbers like p lus d equa ls zero. Then these were sp ira l synchs. This was 
the region of spiral sources. That is the abbreviation  for sources. These were noda l 
synchs and these were the nodal sources. And down here were the saddles. And 
where were the centers? The centers were along this line. 

The centers, there weren't many of them, and they were the separation for these 
two regions. I will put that down. These are the centers. These other borderlines 
correspond to other things. These are defective eigenvalues, zero eigenvalues and so 
on. But let's concentrate on just one of them. You w ill find  the others d iscussed in 
the notes, GS7. But if you get this idea then the rest is just deta ils. I think it w ill be 
perfectly clear. 

What is wrong with the center? The answer is that if we are on the center,  for 
example, this system corresponds to the trace being zero and the determinant being 
plus one. It corresponds to t equals zero and d equals one. This point, in other 
words. Now, if I wigg le the coefficients of the matrix just a  little bit, just change 
them a little bit, what I am going to do is move off this pink line. 

And I might move to here or I might move a little way to there. But, if I do that, I 
change the geometric type. In other words, being a borderline, a slight change of the 
parameters can change what it changes to. And, in  fact, that is geometrica lly clear. 
What does a center look like? A center looks like this, a bunch of curves going 
around a ll in the same d irection, like concentric circles or maybe ellipses or 
something like that. 

If I deform the picture just a little bit, well, I might change it into something that 
looks like this where, after they go around they don't quite meet up with where they 
were to start with. And  I am going to get a spira l synch. Or, I might do the 
deformation by going around once and I'm a little outside of where I was. In which 
case it's going to be a spira l source. The fact that just changing these curves a little 
bit can change the p icture to this or to that corresponds to the fact that if you are on 
here with this value of t and d, zero and one, and just change t and d a little bit, you 
are going to move off into these regions. You might, of course, stay on the pink line. 
It is not very likely. Where does this leave us? 

Well, if the linear system is not stab le  in the sense that if you change the parameters 
a little b it it doesn't change the type. This is, after a ll, only an approximation to the 
nonlinear system. If in this approximation you cannot really pred ict the behavior of 

very well when you change the parameters, then from it you cannot tell what the 
orig ina l system looked like. In other words, the nonlinear system at (1, 1) might be 
any one of the possibilities, still a center or it might be a sp ira l synch or it might be a 
spiral source. Any one of those three is a possibility. It couldn't be a sadd le because 
that is too far away. It couldn't be a node. That is too far away,  too. But it could 
wander into either of these regions and, therefore, the picture you cannot tell which 
of these three it is just from this type of critical point analysis. 

Well, that was Volterra's problem. By the way, the person who introduced these 
equations and stud ied them systematica lly in the way in which we are doing it here 
was Volterra. And, in fact, he was interested in sharks and  food fish, as they were 
called. What do we do? Well, you have to be smart. What Volterra d id was he went 
to method number one. Let's do it. Volterra said I got my equations x' = -x + xy. y 
prime is equa l to, these are the food fish, y' = y - xy. Let's eliminate t. 

And my prob lem is, of course, I am trying to determine what type of critica l point 
one, one is. And the method we have used up until now has fa iled because it gave us 
a borderline case, which is from that we cannot deduce. He said let's eliminate t. And 
we get dy/dx equa ls, I am going to factor, y times one minus x on top. And on the 
bottom factor x negative one plus y. You could solve that before you came into 
18.03, right? This you can separate variables. Let's separate variables. The y's a ll go 
on one side, so y goes down here. It is (y - 1)/y dy equals --

On the other side the dx gets moved up, one minus x over x dx. Now, of course, you 
wouldn't dream of using partia l fractions on this. It would be illegal because, even 
though it is a rational function,  the quotient of two polynomials, the degree of the 
top is not smaller than the degree of the bottom. In other words, it is a partial 
fraction so this degree must be b igger than that one. And it isn't so you would have 
to first divide. And if you d ivide by that then there is no point in using partial 
fractions at a ll. 

Of course, you would have done this by basic  instant, I know. What is the solution? 
It is y - ln(y) = ln(x) - x + c1. That is not the final constant I want so I will give  it a 
subscript one to  indicate I want more. This is very hard to see what that curve looks 
like. We can make it look better by exponentiating. If I exponentiate  it, going back to 
high school mathematics, but I know from experience that many of you are not too 
good at this step, so  that is another reason I am doing it, it will be e^y, times, that 
part is easy because p luses and minuses change into times, times e^(-ln(y)). 

Well, e^(ln(y)) = y. If I put a minus sign in front of that, that sends it into the 
denominator, so instead of being y  it is 1/y. Equals x, e^( ln(x)) = x, e^(-x) is, 
therefore, times 1 / e^(x). And that is times the exponential of c1, which I w ill call 
c2. And now if I comb ine them a ll and put them all on one side it is x / e^x * y / e^y 
is equal to yet another constant, 1/c2. This is my final constant so let's ca ll that c. In 
other words, the integral curves are the graphs of this equation for different values 
of the constant c. 

Well, of course you've graphed an equation like that all the time. What am I going to 
do with this stupid thing? Well, I deliberately picked something which involved a ll 
your learning up until now. We are now going into 18.02, right? You looked at that in 
18.02 you would say this is the contour curve, these are contour curves of the 
function -- Well, let's write it out the other way. It doesn't make any d ifference, but 
you are more likely to have seen the function in this form. x / e^x you won't 

recognize, but this you will. In fact, we have had it before this term. It is one of the 
kinds of solutions you can add to second order equations. Times y e^(-y) = c. It is 
the contour curves of this function. 

Let's call that function, let's say, h(x, y). Well, of course you could throw it on 
Matlab, as you did in 18.02 maybe, and ask Matlab to p lot the function. But Volterra 
didn't have that luxury. He was smart, too. So let's be smart instead. What is the 
function x? Let's use a neutra l variab le like u and plot u e^(-u). 18.01. At zero, it 
has the value zero. When u is small this has approximately the value one and, 
therefore, it starts out like the function u. As u goes to infinity, you know by 
L'Hopital's rule that this goes to zero so it ends up like this. Well, what on earth 
could it possibly do except rise to a maximum? But where is that maximum? 

It is easy to see there is a unique maximum just by 18.01. Take the derivative, find 
out where the maximum point is and you will find, perhaps you have a lready done it, 
this is at one. The maximum occurs at one, that is where the derivative is zero and 
the value there is one times e^(-1). It is 1 / e,  in other words. That is what the 
curve looks like. What do the contour curves of this  look like? 

Well, if we are looking at the contour curves of the function h, so here is x, here is y, 
and we want the contour curves of the function h(x, y), what do I know? Where  is its 
maximum? The maximum point of h(x, y) is where? Well, h = x e^(-x) y e^(-y). 
This has its maximum at one, this has  its maximum at one, so where does h(x, y) 
head? Well, you have two  factors. One makes each of them the b iggest they can be. 
The maximum must be exactly at that critical point (1, 1). That is our maximum 
point. 

Let's make it consp icuous. This is the maximum point. It is the point (1, 1). It is the 
point that makes the function biggest. Now, how about the contour curves? Well, this 
is the top of the mounta in. What is  it along the axes? Along the axes, when either x 
or y is zero, the function has the va lue zero, so it is biggest there. It has the value 
zero here. So it is zero value. What are the contour curves? Well, we must have a 
mountain peak here. This is the unique maximum point. In  fact, it is easy to see the 
contour curves just surround it like that. Now, the reason they cannot be sp ira ls, 
well, in the first place, you never see contour curves that were sp irals. That is a good 
reason. 

It is a mountain. That is the way contour curves of a mountain look. But, all right, 
that is not a good argument. But notice that along each horizonta l line here, I want 
to know how many times can it intersect the contour curve? That is the same as 
asking along one of these lines how many times could it intersect? See, this is a 
graph of the function along this horizontal line. And, therefore, how many times can 
it intersect one of the contour curves the same number of times that a horizontal line 
can intersect this curve? Twice. Only once if you are exactly at that height and after 
that never. But here it can intersect each contour curve only tw ice which means 
these things cannot be spirals. Otherwise, they would intersect those horizontal and 
vertical lines many times instead of just twice. 

That  is what it looks like. In fact, we can even put in the direction without any effort. 
We know that the sharks die out w ithout any food fish and the food fish grow. Well, I 
think this has to be clockwise. Of course,  the guys nearby must be going the same 
way. And, therefore, the guys near them must be going  the same way. And it is sort 
of a domino effect. The direction spreads and there is only one compatible way of 

making these. They all must be going clockwise. What is happening, actually? At this 
point there are a lot of sharks but not so many food fish. The sharks eat the few 
rema ining food fish, and now the sharks start to die out because they have nothing 
to eat. When they are practically gone, the food fish can start growing again and 
grow and grow. 

For a while they grow happily, and then the sharks suddenly start being able to find 
them again. And the few rema ining sharks start eating them, the population of 
sharks grows, the food fish start dying out again, and the cycle starts all over aga in. 
Now, I wanted to talk about the qualitative behavior. This is, in some ways, the most 
important part of the lecture. I wanted  to d iscuss, just as we did at the beginning of 
the term, the effect of fishing with nets at a constant rate k. 

Just as near the beginning of the term, we talked about fishing a single population. 
The only difference is, now there are two populations. Both sharks and the food fish. 
Now, what happens to the equations? Well, the equations start out just as they were. 
I am now  reverting to a and b. You w ill see why. It's because we need the genera l 
coefficients. Plus bxy. But, if we are fishing w ith nets,  then a certa in fraction of the 
sharks in the sea get hauled in by the net. 

And say the fishing rate is k. There is a fishing term. We remove minus k times a 
certain fraction of the sharks in the sea. How about the food fish? Well, we remove 
them, too. And we don't distinguish between sharks and food fish. This is cy - dxy. 
But we also remove a certain  fraction of them. -ky. What, therefore, is the new 
system? The new system is therefore x' = -(a + k)x + bxy. And the y' = (c - k)y -
dxy. 

To solve these, I do not have to go through the analysis. All I have to do is change 
the numbers, change these coefficients from a --> a + k and c minus k. The old 
critica l point was the point (c/d, a/b). The new critical point with  fishing is what? 
Well, the parameters have been changed by the addition of k. The new critica l point 
is ((c - k)/d, (a + k)/d). What is the effect of fishing? Well, if the old critical point 
was over here, let's say this is the point c / d and this is the point a / b, that  is the 
old critical point that was over here. 

The result of fishing is to lower the value of x and ra ise the value here. The new 
critica l point is, this gets lowered to (c - k)/d, and this gets raised to (a + k)/b. In 
other words, the new point is there. The effect of fishing is to -- It does not treat the 
sharks and the yumfish equally. The effect of fishing lowers the shark population. 
See, the critical point gives sort of the average shark population. Of course, it cycles 
around these. But, on the average, this g ives how many sharks there are and how 
many food  fish there are. 

The new critical point w ith  fishing lowers the shark population and raises the food 
fish population. That is not intuitive. And, in  fact, that was observed experimenta lly 
at a slightly different context. And that is why Volterra started working on the 
problem. I will need three more minutes. The most interesting app lication of a ll is 
not to sharks and  food fish. I cannot assume that you are dramatica lly interested in 
how many of them there are in the ocean, but you might be more  interested in this. 

That thing about lowering is ca lled Volterra's princip le. Put that in your books. 
Volterra's princip le. Volterra is spelt over there. -- has found more modern 
applications than sharks. Suppose you consider fish in a pond. You have mosquito 

larvae which breed in the pond. This happens. And then suddenly there is a plague of 
mosquitoes and concerned citizens. And this  is what happened in the `50s. That was 
before you were born, but not before I was. What happened was a  lot of mosquitoes. 
Everybody sa id the mosquitoes breed in the little stagnant ponds so spray DDT on 
them. DDT them. 

Dump it  in the ponds. That will kill all the larvae and we won't get bitten anymore. 
When you put DDT in the pond, as people did not realize at the time because these 
things were new, of course you kill the mosquitoes, but you also kill the fish because 
DDT is poisonous to fish. What, in effect, you are doing mathematica lly is the same 
as harvesting the fish population with the sharks and the food fish. 

The result is, the fish are the predators because they eat the mosquito larvae, big 
food, there was a certain equilibrium, according to Volterra 's principle. With DDT that 
equilibrium moves to here. In other words, the effect of indiscriminately spraying the 
pond w ith DDT is to increase the number of mosquitoes and kill fish. And, in fact, 
that is exactly what was observed. The same thing was observed w ith the b ird 
population and insects. Spraying trees for insects to get rid of some pests ends up 
killing more b irds than it does insects and the insects increase. Thanks.
