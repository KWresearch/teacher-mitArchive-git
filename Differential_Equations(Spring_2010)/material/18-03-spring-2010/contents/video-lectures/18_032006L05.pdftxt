18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 5 

Today, once aga in, a day of solving no differential equations whatsoever. The topic is 
a specia l kind of differentia l equation, which occurs a lot. It's one in which the right-
hand side doesn't have any independent variab le in it. Now, since I'm going  to use as 
the independent variable, t for time, maybe  it would be better to write the left-hand 
side to let you know, since you won't be ab le to  figure out any other way what it is, 
dy dt. 

We will write it this time. dy dt is equa l to, and the point is that there is no t on the 
right hand side. So, there's no t. There's a name for such an equation. Now, some 
people call  it time independent. The only prob lem w ith that is that sometimes the 
independent variable is a  time. It's something else. We need a generic word for there 
being no independent variab le on the right-hand side. So, the word that's used for 
that is autonomous. So, that means no independent variable on the right-hand side. 

It's a function of y a lone, the dependent variab le. Now, your first reaction should be, 
oh, well, big deal. Big dea l. If there's no t on the right hand side, then we can solve 
this by separating variables. So, why has he been ta lking about it  in the first p lace? 
So, I admit that. We can separate variab les, and what I'm going to ta lk about today 
is how to get useful information out of the equation about how its solutions look 
without solving the equation. The reason for wanting to do that is, A, it's fast. It 
gives you a lot of insight, and the actua l solution, I'll illustrate one,  in the first p lace, 
take you quite a while. 

You may not be able to actually do the integrations, the required and separation of 
variables to get an exp licit solution, or it might simply not be worth the effort of 
doing if you only want certain kinds of separations about the solution. So, the thing 
is, the prob lem is, therefore, to get qualitative information about the solutions 
without actually solving -- Without actua lly having to solve the equation. Now, to do 
that, let's take a quick look at how the d irection  fields of such an equation, after all, 
it's the direction field is our principal tool for getting qua litative information about 
solutions without actua lly solving. So, how does the d irection  field look? 

Well, think about it for just a second, and you w ill see that every horizontal line is an 
isocline. So, the horizontal lines, what are their equations? This is the t axis. And, 
here's the y axis. The horizontal lines have the formula y equals a constant. Let's 
make it y equals a y zero for d ifferent va lues of the constant y zero. Those are the 
horizontal lines. And, the point is they are isoclines. Why? Well, because along any 
one of these horizonta l lines, I'll draw one in, what are the slopes of the line 
elements? The slopes are dy / dt is equa l to f(y0), but that's a constant because 
there's no t to change as you move in the horizontal direction. 

The slope is a constant. So, if I draw in that  isocline, I guess I've forgotten, as our 
convention, isoclines are in dashed lines, but  if you have color, you are a llowed to 
put them  in living yellow. Well, I guess I could make them solid, in that case. I don't 
have to make a dash. Then, all the line elements, you put them in at w ill because 

they will all have,  they are a ll the same, and they have slope, that, f(y0). And, 
similarly down here, they'll have some other slope. This one will have some other 
slope. Whatever, this is the y0, the va lue of  it, and whatever that happens to be. I'll 
put it one more. That's the x-axis. 

can use the x-axis. That's an isocline, too. Now, what do you deduce about how the 
solutions must look? Well, let's draw one solution. Suppose one solution looks like 
this. Well, that's an integral curve, in other words. Its graph is a solution. Now, as I 
slide along, these slope elements stay exactly the same, I can slide this curb a long 
horizontally, and it will still be an integral curve everywhere. 

So, in other words, they integral curves are invariant under translation for an 
equation of this type. They a ll look exactly the same, and you get them all by taking 
one, and just pushing it along. Well, that's so simple it's almost uninteresting, except 
in that these equations occur a lot in practice. They are often hard to integrate 
directly. And, therefore,  it's important to be ab le to get information about them. 
Now, how does one do  that? There's one critica l idea, and that is the notion of a 
critica l point. These equations have what are called critica l points. And, what it is is 
very simp le. There are three ways of  looking at it: critica l point, y0; what does it 
mean for y0 to be a critica l point? 

It means, another way of saying it is that it should be a zero of the right-hand side. 
So, if I ask you to find the critical points for the equation, what you will do is solve 
the equation f(y) = 0. Now, what's  interesting about them? Well, for a critica l point, 
what would be the slope of the line element a long, if this is at a critical  level,  if that's 
a critica l point? Look at that isocline. 

What's the slope of the line elements along it? It is zero. And therefore,  for these 
guys, these are, in other words, our solution curves. But let's prove it formally. So, 
there are three ways of saying it. y0 is a critical point. It's a zero of the right-hand 
side, or, y equals y0 is a solution to the equation. Now, that's perfectly easy to 
verify. If y0 makes this right-hand side zero, it's certa inly also y = y0 makes the left-
hand side zero because you're differentiating a constant. So, the reasoning, if you 
want reasoning, is proof. Maybe we can make one line out of a proof. 

To say that it's a solution, what does it mean to say that it's a solution? It means to 
say that when you p lug it in, plug in this constant function, y0, the dy0 / dt =  f(y0). 
Is that true? Yeah. Both sides are zero. It's true. Now, y0 is not a number. Well, it is. 
It's a number on this side, but on this side, what I mean is a constant function whose 
constant value is y0, this function, and its derivatives are zero because it has slope 
zero everywhere. 

So, this guy is a constant function, has slope zero. This is a number which makes the 
right-hand side zero. Well, that's nice. So, in other words, what we found are, by 
find ing these critical points, solving that equation, we found all the horizontal 
solutions. But, what's so good about those? Surely, they must be the most 
interesting solutions there are. Well, think of how the picture goes. Let's draw  in one 
of those horizontal solutions. So, here's a horizontal solution. 

That's a solution. So, this is my y0. That's the height at which it is. And, I'm 
assuming that f(y0) = 0. So, that's a solution. Now, the significance of that  is, 
because it's a solution, in other words, it's an integral curve, remember what's true 
about integra l curves. Other curves are not allowed to cross them. And therefore, 

these things are the absolute barriers. So, for examp le, suppose I have two of them 
is y0, and let's say here's another one, another constant solution. I want to know 
what the curves in between those can do. Well, I do know  that whatever those red 
curves do, the other integral curves, they cannot cross this, and they cannot cross 
that. 

And, you must be able to translate them a long each other w ithout ever having two of 
them intersect. Now, that really limits their behavior, but I'm going to nail  it down 
even more. So, other curves can't cross these. Other integral curves can't cross 
these yellow curves, these yellow  lines, these horizonta l lines. But, I'm going to show 
you more, and namely, so what I'm after is deciding, without solving the equation, 
what those curves must  look like in between. Now, the way to do that is you draw, 
so if we want to make steps, everybody  likes steps, okay, so step one is going to be, 
find these. Find the critical points. 

And, you're going to do that by solving this equation, finding out where it's zero. 
Once you have done that, you are going to draw the graph of f(y). And, the interest 
is going to be, where is it positive? Where is it negative? You've a lready found where 
it's zero. Everywhere else, therefore, it must be either positive or negative. Now, 
once you have found that out, why am I interested in that? Well, because dy/dt = 
f(y), right? That's what the differentia l equation says. Therefore, if this,  for examp le, 
is positive, that means this must be positive. It means that y must be increasing. It 
means the solution must be increasing. 

Where it's negative, the solution will be decreasing. And, that tells me how it's 
behaving in between these yellow lines, or on top of them, or on the bottom. Now, at 
this point, I'm going to stop, or not stop, I mean, I'm going to stop ta lking genera lly. 
And everything in the rest of the period w ill be done by examp les which will get 
increasingly complicated, not terrib ly comp licated by the end. 

But,  let's do one that's super simple to begin w ith. Sorry, I shouldn't say that 
because some of you may be baffled even by here because after all I'm going to be 
doing the ana lysis not in the usual way, but by using new ideas. That's the way you 
make progress. All right, so, let's do our bank account. So, y is money in the bank 
account. r is the  interest rate. Let's assume  it's a continuous interest rate. All banks 
nowadays pay interest continuously, the continuous interest rate. So, if that's a ll 
there is, and money is growing, you know the differential equation says that the rate 
at which it grows is equal to r, the interest rate times a principle, the amount that's 
in the bank at that time. 

So, that's the differential equation that governs that. Now, that's, of course, the 
solution is simp ly an exponentia l curve. There's nothing more to say about it. Now, 
let's make it more interesting. Let's suppose there is a shifty teller at the bank, and 
your money is being embezzled from your account at a constant rate. So, let's let w 
equa l, or maybe e, but e has so many other uses in mathematics, w is relatively 
unused, w  is the rate of embezz lement, thought of as continuous. So, every day a 
little bit of money is sneaked out of your account because you are not paying any 
attention to it. You're off skiing somewhere, and not noticing what's happening to 
your bank account. 

So, since it's the rate, the time rate of embezzlement, I simply subtract it from this. 
It's not w times y because the embezzler isn't stealing a certa in fraction of your 
account. It's simply stea ling a certain number of dollars every day, the same number 

of dollars being w ithdrawn for the count. Okay, now, of course, you could solve this. 
This separates variables immed iately. You get the answer, and there's no prob lem 
with that. Let's ana lyze the behavior of the solutions without solving the equation by 
using these two points. So, I want to analyze this equation using the method of 
critica l points. So,  the first thing I should do is, so, here's our equation, is find the 
critica l points. 

Notice it's an autonomous equation a ll right, because there's no t on the right-hand 
side. Okay, so, the critica l points, well, that's where ry minus w equals zero. In other 
words, there's only one critica l point, and that occurs when y is equa l to w over r. 
So, that's the only critica l point. Now, I want to know what's happening to the 
solution. So, in other words, if I plot, I can write away, of course, negative values 
aren't of particularly interesting here, there is definitely a horizonta l solution, and it 
has the value, it's at the height, y = w / r. That's a solution. 

The question is, what do the other solutions look like? Now, watch how  I make the 
analysis because I'm going to use two now. So,  this is step one, then step two. What 
do I do? Well, I'm going to graph  f(y). Well, f(y) = ry - w. What does that look  like? 
Okay, so, here  is the y-axis. Notice the y-axis  is going horizonta lly because what I'm 
interested in is the graph of this function. 

What do I ca ll the other axis? I'm going to use the same terminology that is used on 
the little visual that describes this. And, that's dy. You could ca ll this other axis the 
f(y) axis. That's not a good name for it. You could ca ll it the dy / dt axis because it's, 
so to speak, the other variab le. That's not great either. But, worst of a ll would be 
introducing yet another letter for which we would have no use whatsoever. 

So, let's think of it. We are plotting, now, the graph of f(y). f(y) =  ry - w. Well, that's 
a line. Its intercept is down here at w, and so the graph looks something like this. 
It's a line. This is the line, ry - w. It has slope r. Well, what am I going to get out of 
that line? Just exactly this. What am I interested in about that line? Nothing other 
than where is  it above the axis, and where is  it below? This function is positive over 
here, and therefore, I'm going to indicate that symbolically, this, by putting an arrow 
here. 

The meeting of this arrow is that y(t) is increasing. See where it's the right-hand side 
of that last board? y of t is increasing when f(y)  is positive. f of y is positive here, 
and therefore, to the right of this point,  it's increasing. Here to the left of it, f of y is 
negative, and therefore over here it's going to be decreasing. What point is this, in 
fact? Well, that's where  it crosses the axis. That's exactly the critica l point, w /  r. 
Therefore, what this says is that a solution, once it's bigger than y / r, it  increases, 
and it increases faster and faster because this function is higher and higher. 

And, that represents the rate of change. So, in other words, once the solution, let's 
say a solution starts over here at time zero. So,  this is the t axis. And, here is the y 
axis. So, now, I'm plotting solutions. If  it starts at t equa ls zero, above this line, that 
is, starts with the va lue w /  r, which is bigger than zero, a value b igger than w over 
r, then it increases, and increases faster and faster. 

If it starts below that, it decreases and decreases faster and faster. Now, in fact, I 
only have to draw two of those because what do all the others look like? They are 
translations. All the other curves look exactly like those. They are just translations of 
them. This guy, if I start closer, it's still going to decrease. Well, that's supposed to 

be a  translation. Maybe it is. So, these guys look like that. Let's do just a tiny bit 
more interpretation of that. 

Well, I think I better leave  it there because we've got harder things to do, and I want 
to make sure we've got time for it. Sorry. Okay, next example, a logistic equation. 
Some of you have already solved this in recitation, and some of you haven't. This is 
a population equation. This  is the one that section 7.1 and section 1.7 is most 
heavily concerned with, this particular equation. The derivation of it is a little vague. 
It's an equation which describes how population increases. And one minute, the 
population behavior of some population, --

-- let's ca ll it, y is the only thing I know to call anything today, but of course your 
book uses capital P for population,  to get you used to different variab les. Now, the 
basic population equation runs dy / dt. There's a certa in growth rate. Let's call it k y. 
So, k is what's called  the growth rate. It's actually, sometimes it's talked about in 
terms of b irthrate. But, it's the net b irth rate. It's the rate at which people, or 
bacteria, or whatever are being born minus the rate at which they are dying. So, it's 
a net birthrate. But, let's just ca ll it the growth rate. Now, if this is the equation, we 
can think of this, if k is constant, that's what's called simple population growth. And 
you are a ll familiar with that. Log istical growth a llows for slightly more complex 
situations. 

Logistic growth says that calling k a constant is unrea listic because the Earth is not 
filled entirely with people. What stops  it from having unlimited growth? Well, the fact 
that the resources, the food, the organism has to live on gets depleted. And, in other 
words, the growth rate declines as y increases. As the population increases, one 
expects the growth rate to decline because resources are being used up, and they 
are not indefinitely ava ilable. 

Well, in other words, we should replace k by a function with this behavior. What's the 
simplest function that declines as y increases? The simp lest choice, and if you are 
ignorant about what else to do, stick with the simplest, at least you won't work any 
harder than you have to, would be to take k equal to the simp lest declining function 
of y there is, which is simply a linear function, A minus BY. 

So, if I use that as the choice of the declining growth rate, the new equation  is dy / 
dt equa ls, here's my new k. The y stays the same, so the equation becomes dy / dt 
= (a - by)y, or in other words, ay - by^2. This equation is what's ca lled the logistic 
equation. It has many applications, not just to population growth. It's app lied to the 
spread of d isease, the spread of a  rumor, the spread of many things. Yeah, a couple 
pieces of chalk here. 

Okay, now, those of you who have solved it know that the exp licit solution involves, 
well, you separate variables, but you will have to use partia l fractions, ugh, I hope 
you love partia l fractions. You're going to need them later in the term. But, I could 
avoid them now by not solving the equation exp licitly. But anyway, you get a 
solution, which I was going to write on the board for you, but you could look  it up in 
your book. It's unpleasant enough  looking to make you  feel that there must be an 
easier way at least to get the basic information out. Okay, let's see if we can get the 
basic information out. What are the critica l points? Well, this is pretty easy. A, I want 
to set the right-hand side equa l to zero. So, I'm going to solve the equation. 

I can  factor out a y. It's going to be y(a-by) = 0. And therefore, the critica l points 
are where y = 0. That's one. And, the other factor is when this factor is zero, and 
that happens when y = a / b. So, there are my two critical points. Okay, what does, 
let's start drawing p ictures of solutions. Let's put it in those right away. Okay, the 
critica l point, zero, g ives me a solution that looks like this. And, the critica l point, a / 
b, those are positive numbers. So, that's somewhere up here. So, those are two 
solutions, constant solutions. In other words, if the population by dumb luck started 
at zero, it would stay at zero  for a ll time. 

That's not terribly surprising. But, it's a  little less obvious that if it starts at that 
magic number, a / b, it w ill a lso stay at that magic number for all time without 
moving up or down or away from it. Now, the question is, therefore, what happens in 
between? So, for the in between, I'm going to make that same ana lysis that I made 
before. And, it's really not very hard. Look, so here's my dy/dt-axis. I'll ca ll that y', 
okay? And, here's the y-axis. So, I'm now doing step two. This was step one. Okay, 
the function that I want to graph  is this one, ay - by^2, or in factor form, y(a - by). 
Now, this function, we know, has a zero. It has a zero here, and it has a zero at the 
point a / b. 

At these two critica l points, it has a zero. What is it doing in between? Well, in 
between,  it's a parabola. It's a quadratic function. It's a parabola. Does  it go up or 
does it go down? Well, when y  is very large, it's very negative. That means it must 
be a downward-opening parabola. And therefore, this curve looks like this. So, I'm 
interested in knowing, where  is it positive, and where is it negative? Well, it's 
positive, here,  for this range of values of y. Since it's positive there, it will be 
increasing there. Here, it's negative, and therefore it will be decreasing. 

Here, it's negative, and therefore, dy / dt will be negative also, and therefore the 
function, y, will be decreasing here. So, how do  these other solutions look? Well, we 
can put them in. I'll put them in in white, okay, because this has got to last until the 
end of the term. So, how are they doing? They are increasing between the two 
curves. They are not allowed to cross either of these yellow curves. But, they are 
always increasing. Well, if they're always increasing, they must start here and 
increase, and not a llowed to cross. It must do something like that. This must be a 
translation of it. In other words, the curves must look like that. Those are supposed 
to be translations of each other. 

I know they aren't, but use your imag inations. But what's happening above? So in 
other words, if I start with a population anywhere b igger than zero but less than a / 
b, it increases asymptotica lly to the  level a over b. What happens if I start above 
that? Well, then it decreases to it because, this way, for the values of y > a/b,  it 
decreases as time increases. So, these guys up here are doing this. 

And, how about the ones below the axis? Well, they have no physica l significance. 
But let's put them in anyway. Whether they doing? They are decreasing away from 
zero. So,  these guys don't mean anything physically, but mathematically they exist. 
Their solutions, they're going down like that. Now, you notice from this picture that 
there are, even though both of these are constant solutions, they have dramatica lly 
different behavior. 

This one, this solution, is the one that all other solutions try to approach as time 
goes to infinity. This one, the solution zero,  is repulsive, as it were. Any solution that 
starts near zero, if it starts at zero, of course, it stays there for a ll time, but if it 

starts just a little b it above zero, it increases to a/b. This is called a stab le solution 
because everybody tries to get closer and closer to it. This is called, zero is also a 
constant solution, but this is an unstable solution. And now, usually, solution is too 
general a word. I think it's better to call it a stable critica l point, and an unstable 
critica l point. But, of course, it also corresponds to a solution. 

So, critical points are not all the same. Some are stable, and some are unstable. 
And, you can see which is which just by looking at this picture. If the arrows point 
towards them, you've got a stable critical point. If it arrows point away from them, 
you've got an unstable critica l point. Now, there is a  third possibility. Okay, I think 
we'd better address  it because otherw ise you're going to sit there wondering, hey, 
what did he do? Suppose it looks like this. Suppose it were just tangent. Well, this is 
the p icture of that curve, the p ink curve. What would the arrows look like then? 

What would the arrows look like then? Well, since they are positive,  it's always 
positive, the arrow goes like this. And then on the side, it also goes in the same 
direction. So, is this critica l point stable or unstable? It's stab le if you approach it 
from the  left. So, how, in fact, do the curves, how would the correspond ing curves 
look? Well, there's our long-term solution. This corresponds to that point. Let's ca ll 
this a, and then this will be the value, a. If I start below  it, I rise to it. If I start 
above it, I increase. So, if I start above it, I do this. Well, now, that's stab le on one 
side, and unstable on the other. And, that's indicated by saying it's semi-stable. 

That's a brilliant word. I wonder how long it to do think that one up, semi-stab le 
critica l point: stable on one side, unstable on the other depending on whether you 
start below it. And, of course, it could be reversed if I had drawn the p icture the 
other way. I could have approached it from the top, and left it from below. You get 
the idea of the behavior. Okay, let's now take, I'm going to soup up this log istic 
equation just a little bit more. So, let's talk about the logistic equation. But, I'm 
going to add to it harvesting, with harvesting. 

So, this  is a very  late 20th century concept. So, we imagine,  for examp le, a bunch of 
formerly free range Atlantic sa lmon penned in one of these huge factory farms off 
the coast of Maine or someplace. They've made salmon much cheaper than it used to 
be, but at a certa in cost to the salmon, and possibly to our environment. So, what 
happens? Well, the sa lmon grow, and grow, and do what salmon do. And, they are 
harvested. That's a word somewhere in the category of ethnic cleansing  in my 
opinion. But, it's, again, a very 20th-century word. I think it was Hitler who 
discovered that, that all you had  to do was call something by a sanitary name, and 
no matter how horrible it was, good bourgeois people would accept it. 

So, the harvesting, which means, of course, picking them up and killing them, and 
putting them in cans and stuff like that, okay, so what's the equation? I'm going to 
assume that the harvest is at a constant time rate. In other words, it's not a certain 
fraction of all the sa lmon that are being caught each day and canned. The factory 
has a certa in capacity, so, 400 pounds of salmon each day are pulled out and 
canned. So, it's a constant time rate. That means that the equation is now going to 
be dy/dt is equal to, well, salmon grow logistica lly. 

ay - by^2, so, that part of the equation is the same. But, I need a term to take care 
of this constant harvesting rate, and that will be h. Let's ca ll it h, not h times y. 
Then, I would be harvesting a certain fraction of all the sa lmon there, which is not 
what I'm doing. Okay: our equation. Now, I want to analyze what the critical points 

of this  look like. Now, this is a little more subtle because there's now a new 
parameter, there. And, what I want to see  is how that varies with the new 
parameter. The best thing to do is, I mean, the thing not to do  is make this equa l to 
zero, fiddle around with the quadratic formula, get some massive expression, and 
then spend the next half hour scratching your head trying to  figure out what it 
means, and what information you are supposed  to be getting out of it. 

Draw pictures instead. Draw pictures. If h is zero, that's the sma llest harvesting  rate 
I could have. The picture looks like our old one. So, if h is zero, the picture looks 
like, what color did I, okay, pink. Yellow. Yellow  is the cheapest, but I can't find it. 
Okay, yellow is commercially available. These are precious. All right, purp le if it's 
okay, purple. So, this is the one, our origina l one correspond ing to h equals zero. Or, 
in other words, it's the equation ay - by^2. h is zero. Now, if I want to find, I now 
want to increase the va lue of h, well, if I increase the va lue of h, in other words, 
harvest more and more, what's happening? 

Well, I simply lower this function by h. So, if I lower h somewhat, it will come to 
here. So,  this is some va lue, ay - by^2 - h1, let's say. That's this curve. If I lower it 
a lot, it w ill  look like this. So, ay - by^2 - h20. This doesn't mean anything. Two. 
Obviously, there's one interesting value to lower it by. It's a va lue which would lower 
it exactly by this amount. Let me put that in specia l. If I lower it by just that amount, 
the curve a lways looks the same. 

It's just been lowered. I'm going to say this one  is, so this one is the same thing, 
except that I've subtracted (h)m. Where is (h)m on the p icture? Well, I lowered it by 
this amount. So, this height is h sub m. In other words, if I find the maximum height 
here, which is easy to do because  it's a parabola, and lower it by exactly that 
amount, I will have lowered it to this point. 

This will be a critica l point. Now,  the question is, what's happened to the critical point 
as I did this? I started with the critica l points here and here. As I lower h, the critical 
point changed to this and that. And now, it changed to this one when I got to the 
purple line. And, as I went still further down, there were no critical points. So, this 
curve has no critica l points attached to  it. What are the correspond ing pictures? Well, 
the corresponding p ictures, well, we've already drawn, the p icture for h = 0 is drawn 
already. The pictures that I'm talking about are how the solutions look. How would 
the solution look like for this one for h1? For h1, the solutions look like, here is a/b. 

Here is a/b, but the critical points aren't at zero and a over b anymore. They've 
moved in a little bit. So, they are here and here. And, otherwise, the solutions look 
just like they d id before, and the ana lysis is the same. And, similarly, if h2 goes very 
far, if h2 is very large, there are no critica l points. h, too large, no critical points. Are 
the solutions decreasing a ll the time or increasing? Well, they are a lways decreasing 
because the function is a lways negative. Solutions always go down, always. The 
interesting one is this last one, where I decreased it just to (h)m. And, what happens 
there is there is this certain, magic critical point whose value we could calculate. 

here's one constant solution. So, this is one that has the va lue. Sorry, I'm ca lculating 
the solutions out. So, y here and t here, so here it  is value, (h)m is the va lue by 
which it has been lowered. So, this is the picture for (h)m. And, how do the solutions 
look? Well, to the right of that, they are decreasing. And, to the left they are also 
decreasing because this function is always negative. So, the solutions  look like this,  if 
you start above, and if you start below, they decrease. And, of course, they can't get 

lower than zero because these are salmon. What is the significance of (h)m? (h)m is 
the maximum rate of harvesting. It's an extremely important number for this 
industry. 

If the maximum time rate at which you can pull the salmon da ily out of the water, 
and can them without what happening? Without the salmon going to zero. As long as 
you start above, and don't harvest it more than this rate, it will be following these 
curves. You will be follow ing these curves, and you w ill still have salmon. If you 
harvest just a little b it more, you will be on this curve that has no critica l points, and 
the salmon in the tank w ill decrease to zero.
