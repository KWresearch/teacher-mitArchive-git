18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 4 

The top ic for today is how to change variables. So, we're ta lking about substitutions 
and differentia l equations, or changing variables. That might seem like a sort of 
fussy thing to talk about  in the third or fourth lecture, but the reason  is that so far, 
you know how to solve two kinds of differentia l equations, two kinds of first-order 
differentia l equations, one where you can separate variables, and the linear equation 
that we talked about last time. 

Now, the sad  fact is that in some sense, those are the only two general methods 
there are, that those are the only two kinds of equations that can always be solved. 
Well, what about all the others? The answer is that to a great extent, a ll the other 
equations that can be solved, the solution can be done by chang ing the variables in 
the equation to reduce it to one of the cases that we can a lready do. Now, I'm going 
to g ive you two examp les of that, two significant examples of that today. But, 
ultimately, as you will see, the way the equations are solved is by changing them 
into a linear equation, or an equation where the variables are separable. 

However, that's for a few minutes. The first change of variab les that I want to ta lk 
about is an almost trivia l one. But it's the most common kind there is, and you've 
already had it in physics class. But I think it's so important in the science and 
eng ineering subjects that it's a good idea, even in 18.03, to call attention to it 
exp licitly. So, in that sense, the most common change of variables is the one simple 
one called scaling. So, aga in, the kind of equation I'm ta lking about is a general first-
order equation. And, scaling simp ly means to change the coordinates, in effect, or 
axes, to change the coordinates on the axes to scale the axes, to either stretch them 
or contract them. 

So, what does the change of variable actua lly look like? Well, it means you introduce 
new variables, where x1 is equal to x times something or times a constant. I'll write 
it as divided by a constant, since that tends to be a  little bit more the way people 
think of it. And y, the same. So, the new variable y1 is related to the old one by an 
equation of that form. So, a, b are constants. So, those are the equations. Why does 
one do this? Well,  for a lot of reasons. But, maybe we can list them. You, for 
example, could be chang ing units. That's a common reason in physics. Changing the 
units that he used, you would have to make a change of coordinates of this form. 

Perhaps the even more important reason is to, sometimes it's used to make the 
variables d imensionless. In other words, so that the variables become pure numbers, 
with no units attached to them. Since you are well aware of the tortures involved in 
dealing with units in physics, the point of making variables, I'm sorry, d imensionless, 
I don't have to sell that. Dimensionless, i.e. no units, w ithout any units attached. It 
just represents the number three, not three seconds, or three grahams, or anything 
like that. 

And, the third reason is to reduce or simplify the constants: reduce the number or 
simplify the constants in the equation. Reduce their number is self explanatory. 

Simp lify means make them less, either d imensionless also, or if you can't do that, at 
least less dependent upon the critical units than the old ones were. Let me give you 
a very simple example which w ill illustrate most of these things. It's the equation. 
It's a version of the cooling law, which applies at very high temperatures, and it 
runs. So, it's like Newton's cooling laws, except it's the interna l and externa l 
temperatures vary, what's important is not the first power as in Newton's Law, but 
the fourth power. 

So, it's a constant. And, the difference is, now, it's the external temperature, which, 
just so  there won't be so many capital T's in the equation, I'm going to call M, dT / dt 
= k(M^4 - T^4). So, T is the  interna l temperature, the thing we are interested in. 
And, M is the externa l constant, which I'll assume, now, is a constant externa l 
temperature. 

So, this  is valid if big temperature d ifferences, Newton's Law, breaks down and one 
needs a different one. Now, you are free to solve that equation just as it stands, if 
you can. There are d ifficulties connected with it because you're dealing w ith the 
fourth powers, of course. But, before you do that, one should scale. How should I 
sca le? Well, I'm going to scale by relating T to M. So, that is very likely to use is T1 
= T / M. This is now dimensionless because M, of course, has the units of 
temperature, degrees Celsius, degrees absolute, whatever it is, as does T. 

And therefore, by taking the ratio of the two, there are no units attached to it. So, 
this is d imensionless. Now, how actually do I change the variable in the equation? 
Well, watch this. It's an utterly trivia l idea, and utterly important. Don't slog around 
doing it this way, trying to stuff it in, and d ivide first. Instead, do the inverse. In 
other words, write  it instead as T equals MT1, the reason being that  it's T that's 
facing you in that equation, and therefore T you want to substitute for. So, let's do it. 
The new equation will be what? Well, dT-- Since this is a constant, the left-hand side 
becomes dT1 / dt * M = k (M^4 - M^4 T1^4), so I'm going to factor out that M to 
the forth, and make it (1 - T1^4), okay? 

Now, I could divide through by M and get rid of one of those, and so, the new 
equation, now, is dT1 / dt, d time, is equal to-- Now, I have k M^3 out front here. 
I'm going to just g ive that a new name, k1. Essentially, it's the same equation. It's 
no harder to solve and no easier to solve than the orig ina l one. But it's been 
simplified. For one, I think  it looks better. So, to compare the two, I'll put this one up 
in green, and this one in green, too, just to convince you it's the same, but indicate 
that it's the same equation. 

Notice, so, T1 has been rendered, is now dimensionless. So, I don't have to even ask 
when I solve this equation, oh, p lease tell me what the units of temperature are. 
How you are measuring temperature makes no difference to this equation. k1 still 
has units. What units does it have? It's been simplified because it now has the units 
of, since this is dimensionless and this is d imensionless, it has the units of inverse 
time. So, k1, whereas it had units  involving both degrees and seconds before, now it 
has inverse time as its units. And, moreover, there's one less constant. So, one  less 
constant in the equation. 

It just looks better. This business, I think you know that k1, the process of forming 
k1 out of k M cubed is ca lled lumping constants. I think they use standard 
terminology in physics and eng ineering courses. Try to get all the constants together 
like this. And then you lump them there. They are lumped  for you, and then you just 

give the lump a new name. So, that's an examp le of sca ling. Watch out for when you 
can use that. For example, it would have probab ly been a good thing to use in the 
first problem set when you were handling this problem of drug elimination and 
hormone elimination production inside of the thing. You could lump constants, and as 
was done to some extent on the solutions to get a neater looking answer, one 
without so many constants in it. 

Okay, let's now go to serious stuff, where we are actually going to make changes of 
variables which we hope will render unsolvable equations suddenly solvable. Now, 
I'm going to do that by making substitutions. But, it's, I think, quite important to 
watch up there are two kinds of substitutions. There are direct substitutions. That's 
where you introduce a new variable. I don't know how  to write this on the board. I'll 
just write it schematically. So, it's one which says that the new variab le  is equa l to 
some comb ination of the old variab les. The other kind of substitution is inverse. It's 
just the reverse. 

Here, you say that the old variables are some combination of the new. Now, often 
you'll have to stick in a few old variables, too. But the basic, it's what appears on the 
left-hand side. Is it a new variab le that appears on the left-hand side by itself, or is it 
the old variab le that appears on the left-hand side? Now, right here, we have an 
example. If I did it as a direct substitution, I would have written T1 = T / M. 

That's the way I define the new variable, which of course you have to do if you're 
introducing it. But when I actua lly d id the substitution, I d id the inverse substitution. 
Namely, I used T = M*T1. And, the reason  for doing that was because it was the 
capital T's that faced me in the equation and I had to have something to replace 
them with. Now, you see this already in ca lculus, this d istinction. But that might 
have been a year and a half ago. Just let me remind you, typica lly in calculus, for 
example, when you want to do this kind of integral, let's say, integra l of x*sqrt(1 -
x^2) dx, the substitution you'd use for that is u = 1 - x^2, right? And then, you 
calculate, and then you would observe that this, the x dx, more or less makes up du, 
apart from a constant factor, there. 

So, this would be an examp le of direct substitution. You put it in and convert the 
integral into an integral of u. What would be an example of inverse substitution? 
Well, if I take away the x and ask you, instead,  to do this integral, then you know 
that the right thing to do  is not to start with u, but to start with the x and write x 
equa ls sine or cosine u. So, this is a d irect substitution in that integra l, but this 
integral calls for an inverse substitution in order to be ab le to do it. And notice, they 
would look practica lly the same. But, of course, as you know from your experience, 
they are not. They're very different. Okay, so I'm going to watch for that distinction 
as I do these examp les. The first one I want to do is an example as a direct 
substitution. 

So, it applies to the equation of the form y prime equals, there are two kinds of 
terms on the right-hand side. Let's use p of x, p(x)*y + q(x)*y^n. Well, notice, for 
example, if n were zero, what kind of equation would this be? y^n would be one, and 
this would be a linear equation, which you know how to solve. So, n equals zero we 
already know how to do. So, let's assume that n is not zero, so that we're in new 
territory. 

Well, if n were equal to one, you could separate variables. So, that too is not 
exciting. But, nonetheless, it w ill be included in what I'm going to say now. If n is 

two or three, or n could be one ha lf. So anything: even zero is all right. It's just silly. 
Any number: it could be negative. n equa ls minus five. That would be fine a lso. This 
kind of equation, to g ive it its name, is called the Bernoulli equation, named after 
which Bernoulli, I haven't the fa intest idea. There were, I think, three or four of 
them. And, they fought w ith each other. But, they were a ll smart. Now, the key trick, 
if you like, method, to solving any Bernoulli equation, let me ca ll another thing. Most 
important is what's missing. 

It must not have a pure x term in it. And that goes for a constant term. In other 
words, it must look exactly like this. Everything multip lied by y, or a power of y,  two 
terms. So, for example, if I add one to this, the equation becomes non-doable. Right, 
it's very easy to contaminate  it into an equation that's unsolvable. It's got to look 
just like that. Now, you've got one on your homework. You've got severa l. Both part 
one and part two have Bernoulli equations on them. So, this is practica l, in some 
sense. What do we got? The idea is to divide by y^n. Ignore a ll formulas that you're 
given. Just remember that when you see something that looks like this, or something 
that you can turn  into something that looks like this, divide through by y to the nth 
power, no matter what n is. 

All right, so y' / y^n = p(x)*1 / (y^(n-1)) + q(x). Well, that certainly doesn't look 
any better than what I started with. And, in your terms, it probably looks somewhat 
worse because it's got all those Y's at the denominator, and who wants to see them 
there? But, look at  it. In this very slightly transformed Bernoulli equation is a linear 
equation struggling to be free. Where is it? Why is it trying to be a linear equation? 
Make a new variable, ca ll this hunk of it in new variable. Let's call  it V. So, V = 1 / 
y^(n-1). Or, if you like, you can think of that as y^(1-n). 

What's V prime? So,  this is the direct substitution I am going to use, but of course, 
the prob lem is, what am I going to use on this? Well, the little miracle happens. 
What's the derivative of this? It is y' = (1-n)*y^(-n)*y'. In other words, up to a 
constant, this constant factor, one minus n, it's exactly the left-hand side of the 
equation. Well,  let's make N not equal one either. As I sa id, you could separate 
variables if n equa ls one. What's the equation, then, turned into? 

A Bernoulli equation, divided through in this way, is then turned into the equation 
one minus n, sorry, V' / (1 - n) = p(x)*V + q(x). It's linear. And now, solve it as a 
linear equation. Solve it as a linear equation. You notice, it's not in standard form, 
not in standard linear form. To do that, you're going to have to put the p on the 
other side. That's okay, that term, on the other side, solve it, and at the end, don't 
forget that you put in the V. It wasn't in the orig inal problem. So, you have to 
convert the problem, the answer, back in terms of y. It'll come out in terms of V, but 
you must put it back in terms of y. 

Let's do a rea lly simple example just to illustrate the method, and to illustrate the 
fact that I don't want you to memorize formulas. Learn methods, not final formulas. 
So, suppose the equation is, let's say, y' = y / x - y^2. That's a Bernoulli equation. I 
could, of course, have concealed it by writing xy prime plus xy prime minus xy 
equa ls negative y squared. Then, it wouldn't look instantly like a Bernoulli equation. 
You would have to stare at it a while and say, hey, that's a Bernoulli equation. Okay, 
but so I'm handing it to you a silver platter, as it were. So, what do we do? 

Divide through by y squared. So, it's y' / y^2 = 1 / x * 1 / y - 1. And now, the 
substitution, then, I'm going to make,  is for this thing. V = 1 / y. It's a d irect 

substitution. V' = -1 / y^2 * y'. Don't forget to use the chain rule when you 
differentiate w ith respect-- because the differentiation is w ith respect to x, of course, 
not with respect to y. Okay, so what's this thing? That's the left-hand side. The only 
thing is it's got a negative sign. So, this is minus V prime equals, one over x stays 
one over x, one over y. So, it's V / x - 1. 

So, let's put that in standard form. In standard form, it will look like, first imagine 
multip lying it through by negative one, and then putting this term on the other side. 
And, it w ill turn into V' + V / x = 1. So, that's the linear equation in standard linear 
form that we are asked to solve. And, the solution isn't very hard. The integrating 
factor is, well, I integrate one over x. 

That makes log x. And, e to the log x, so, it's e to the log x, which is, of course, just 
x itself. So, I should multip ly this through by x squared, be ab le to integrate it. Now, 
some of you, I would hope, just can see that right away, that if you multiply this 
through by x, it's going to look good. So, after we multiply through by x, which I 
get? (xV) prime for the-- maybe I shouldn't skip a step. 

You are still learning this stuff, so let's not skip a step. So, it becomes xV' + V = x, 
okay? After I multiplied through by the integrating factor, this now says this is xV 
prime, and I quickly check that that,  in fact,  is what it's equa l to, equals x, and 
therefore xV = 1/2 x^2 + c. And,  therefore, V = 1/2x + c / x. 

You can leave it at that form, or you can comb ine terms. It doesn't matter much. Am 
I done? The answer is, no I am not done, because nobody reading this answer would 
know what V was. V wasn't in the original problem. It was y that was in the orig inal 
problem. And therefore, the relation is, one is the reciprocal of the other. And 
therefore, I have to turn this expression upside down. Well, if you're going to have to 
turn it upside down, you probab ly should make it look a little better. Let's rewrite it 
as x^2 + 2c, comb ining fractions, I think they call it in high school or elementary 
school, plus 2c. 

How's that? (x^2 + 2c) / (2x). Now, 2c, you don't ca ll it constant 2c because this is 
just as arbitrary to ca ll it c1. So, I'll call that, so, my answer will be y = 2x / (x^2 + 
C1), where C1 is an arbitrary constant. To indicate it's d ifferent from that one, I'll 
call it C1. C1 is two times the old one, but that doesn't really matter. So, there's the 
solution. 

It has an arb itrary constant in it, but you note it's not an add itive arb itrary constant. 
The arb itrary constant is tucked into the solution. If you had to satisfy an initial 
cond ition, you would take this form, and starting from this form,  figure out what C1 
was in order to satisfy that initial cond ition. Thus, Bernoulli equation is solved. Our 
first Bernoulli equation: isn't that exciting? So, here was the equation, and there is 
its solution. Now, the one I'm asking you to solve on the problem set in part two is 
no harder than this, except I ask you some hard questions about it, not very hard, 
but a little hard about  it. 

I hope you w ill find them interesting questions. You already have the experimental 
evidence from  the first problem set, and the problem is to expla in the experimental 
evidence by actually solving the equation in the scene. I think you'll find it 
interesting. But, maybe that's just a pious hope. Okay, I like, now, to turn to the 
second method, where a second class of equations which require inverse 

substitution, and those are equations, which are ca lled homogeneous, a highly 
overworked word in differentia l equations, and in mathematics in general. 

But,  it's unfortunately just the right word to describe them. So, these are 
homogeneous, first-order ODE's. Now, I a lready used the word in one context in 
talking about the linear equations when zero is the right hand side. This is different, 
but nonetheless, the two uses of the word have the same common source. The 
homogeneous d ifferential equation, homogeneous newspeak, is y prime equa ls, it's a 
question of what the right hand side looks like. And, now,  the supposed way to say it 
is, you should be able to write the right-hand side as a function of a comb ined 
variable, F(y/x). 

In other words, after fooling around w ith the right hand side a little bit, you should 
be ab le to write it so that every time a variable appears, it's a lways in the 
combination y/x. Let me give some examples. For example, suppose y' = x^2 y / 
(x^3 + y^3). Well, that doesn't look in that form. Well, yes it is. Imag ine dividing 
the top and bottom by x cubed. What would you get? The top would be y/x, if you 
divided it by x cubed. And,  if I divide the bottom by x cubed, also, which, of course, 
doesn't change the va lue of the fraction, as they say in elementary school, 1 + 
(y/x)^3. So, this is the way it started out looking, but you just sa id ah-ha, that was 
a homogeneous equation because I could see it could be written that way. 

How about another homogeneous equation? How about x y'? Is that a homogeneous 
equation? Of course it is: otherw ise, why would  I be talking about it? If you d ivide 
through by x, you can tuck it inside the rad ica l,  the square root,  if you remember to 
square it when you do that. And, it becomes sqrt(1 + y^2/x^2). It's homogeneous. 
Now, you might say, hey, this looks like you had to be rather clever to figure out if 
an equation is homogeneous. Is there some other way? Yeah, there is another way, 
and it's the other way which exp lains why it's ca lled homogeneous. You can think of 
it this way. 

It's an equation which is, in modern speak,  invariant, invariant under the operation 
zoom. What is zoom? Zoom is, you increase the sca le equa lly on both axes. So, the 
zoom operation is the one which sends x into a times x, and y into a times y. In 
other words, you change the sca le on both axes by the same factor, a. Now, what I 
say is, gee, maybe you shouldn't write it like this. Why don't we say, we introduce, 
how about this? 

So, think of it as a change of variables. We w ill write it like that. So, you can put 
here an equals sign, if you don't know what this meaningless arrow means. So, I'm 
making this change of variables, and I'm describ ing it as an inverse substitution. But 
of course, it wouldn't make any difference. It's exactly the same as the direct 
substitution I started out w ith underscaling. The only difference is, I'm not using 
different scales on both axes. I'm expand ing them both equally. 

That's what I mean by zoom. Now, what happens to the equation? Well, what 
happens to dy/dx? Well, dx = (a)dx1. dy = (a)dy1. And therefore, the ratio, dy/dx = 
dy1/dx1. So, the left-hand side becomes dy1 over dx1, and the right-hand side 
becomes F of, well, y over x  is the same as y over, since I've sca led them equa lly, 
this is the same as y1 over x1. 

So, it's y1 over x1, and the net effect is I simply, everywhere I have an x, I change it 
to x1, and wherever I have a y, I change it to y1, which, what's in a name? It's the 

identica l equation. So, I haven't changed the equation at all via zoom 
transformation. And, that's what makes  it homogeneous. That's not an uncommon 
use of the word homogeneous. When you say space is homogeneous, every 
direction, well, that means, I don't know. It means, okay, I'm getting into troub le 
there. I'll let it go since I can't prepare any better, I haven't prepared any better 
exp lanation, but this is a pretty good one. 

Okay, so, suppose we've got a homogeneous equation. How do we solve it? So, 
here's our equation, F(y/x). Well, what substitution would you like to make? 
Obviously, we should make a direct substitution, z=y/x. So, why did he say that this 
was going to be an example of inverse substitution? Because I wanted to confuse 
you. But  look, that's fine. If you write it in that form, you'll know exactly what to do 
with the right-hand side. And, this is why everybody loves to do that. But for Charlie, 
you have to substitute into the left-hand side as well. 

And, I can testify, for many years of looking w ith sinking heart at examination 
papers, what happens if you try to make a d irect substitution like this? You say, oh, I 
need z prime. z prime equa ls, well, I better use the quotient rule for d ifferentiating 
that. And, it comes out this long, and then either a  long pause, what do I do now? 
Because it's not at all obvious what to do at that point. Or, much worse, two pages 
of frantic ca lculations, and g iving up in tota l despair. 

Now, the reason for that is because you tried to do it making a direct substitution. All 
you have to do instead is use it, treat  it as an inverse substitution, write y equals zx. 
What's the motivation for doing that? It's clear from the equation. This goes through 
all of mathematics. Whenever you have to change a variable, excuse me, whenever 
you have to change a variab le, look at what you have to substitute for, and focus 
your attention on that. 

I need to know what y prime is. Okay, well, then I better know what y is. If I know 
what y is, do I know what y prime is? Oh, of course. y' = z'x + z. And now, I turned 
with that one stroke, the equation has now become z'x + z + F(z). Well, I don't 
know. Can I solve that? Sure. That can be solved because this is x dz/dx. Just put 
the z on the other side, it's F(z) - z. And now, this side is just a function of z. 
Separate variables. 

And, the only thing to watch out for is, at the end, the z was your business. You've 
got to put the answer back in terms of z and y. Okay, let's work an example of this. 
Since I haven't done any modeling yet this period, let's make a little model, 
differentia l equations model. It's a physica l situation, which will be solved by an 
equation. And, guess what? The equation w ill turn out to be homogeneous. 

Okay, so the situation is as follows. We are in the Caribbean somewhere, a little 
isolated island somewhere w ith a little lighthouse on it at the origin, and a beam of 
light shines from the lighthouse. The beam of light can rotate the way the lighthouse 
beams. But, this particular beam is being controlled by a guy in the lighthouse who 
can aim it wherever he wants. And, the reason he's interested in a iming it wherever 
he wants  is there's a drug boat here, [LAUGHTER] which has just been caught in the 
beam of light. 

So, the drug boat, which has just been caught in a beam of light, and feels it'd a 
better escape. Now, the lighthouse keeper wants to keep the drug boat; the light is 
shining on it so that the U.S. Coast Guard helicopters can zoom over it and do 

whatever they do to drug boats, -- -- I don't know. So, the drug boat immed iately 
has to  follow an escape strategy. And, the only one that occurs to him is, well, he 
wants to go further away, of course,  from the lighthouse. On the other hand, it 
doesn't seem sensible to do it in a straight line because the beam w ill keep shining 
on him. So, he fixes the boat at some angle, let's say, and goes off so that the ang le 
stays 45 degrees. 

So, it goes so  that the angle between the beam and maybe, draw the beam a  little 
less like a 45 degree angle. So, the angle between the beam and the boat, the boat's 
path is a lways 45 degrees, goes at a constant 45 degree ang le to the beam, hoping 
thereby to escape. On the other hand, of course, the lighthouse guy keeps the beam 
always on the boat. So, it's not clear it's a good strategy, but this is a differentia l 
equations class. The question is, what's the path of the boat? What's the boat's path? 
Now, an obvious question is, why is this a prob lem in d ifferential equations at all? In 
other words, looking at this, you might scratch your head and try to think of d ifferent 
ways to solve it. 

But, what suggests that it's going to be a prob lem in differential equations? The 
answer is, you're  looking for a path. The answer is going to be a curve. A curve 
means a function. We are looking  for an unknown function, in other words. And, 
what type of information do we have about the function? The only information we 
have about the function is something about its slope, that its slope makes a constant 
45Ã‚Â° angle with the  lighthouse beam. 

Its slope makes a constant known angle to a known angle. Well, if you are trying to 
find a function, and a ll you know is something about its slope, that is a prob lem in 
differentia l equations. Well, let's try to solve it. Well, let's see. Well, let me draw just 
a little b it. So, here's the horizontal. Let's introduce the coordinates. In other words, 
there's the horizontal and here's the boat to  indicate where I am with respect to the 
picture. 

So, here's the boat. Here's the beam, and the path of the boat is going to make a 
45Ã‚Â° angle with it. So, this is the path that we are talking about. And now, let's label 
what I know. Well, this angle is 45Ã‚Â°. This ang le, I don't know, but of course I can 
calculate it easily enough because it has to do w ith, if I know the coord inates of this 
point, (x, y), then of course that horizonta l angle, I know the slope of this line, and 
that ang le w ill be related to the slope. 

So, let's ca ll this alpha. And now, what I want to know is what the slope of the whole 
path is. So, y prime-- let's ca ll y = y(x), the unknown function whose path, whose 
graph is going to be the boat's path, unknown graph. What's its slope? Well, its slope 
is the tangent of the sum of these two ang les, alpha plus 45Ã‚Â°. Now, what do I 
know? Well, I know that the tangent of a lpha is how much? That's tan a lpha = y/x. 
In other words, if this was the point, x over y, this  is the angle it makes w ith a 
horizontal, if you think of it over here. So, this angle is the same as that one, and it's 
y over, its slope of that  line is y over x. 

So, the tangent of the angle is y over x. How about the tangent of 45Ã‚Â°? That's one, 
and there's a formula. This is the hard part. All you have to know is that the formula 
exists, and then you w ill  look it up if you have forgotten it, relating the tangent or 
giving you the tangent of the sum of two angles, and you can, if you like, clever, 
derive  it from the formula for the sign and cosine of the sum of two angles. But, one 
peak  is worth a  thousand finesses. 

So, it is the tangent of alpha plus the tangent of 45Ã‚Â°. Let me read it out in a ll its 
gory details, divided by one, so you'll at least learn the formula, 1 - tan alpha * tan 
45Ã‚Â°. This would work for the tangent of the sum of any two ang les. That's the 
formula. So, what do I get then? y' = (y/x + 1)  / (1 - y/x). 

Now, there is no reason  for doing anything to it, but let's make it look a little 
prettier, and thereby, make it less obvious that it's a homogeneous equation. If I 
multip ly top and bottom by x, it looks prettier. (x+y)/(x-y) = y'. That's our 
differentia l equation. But, notice, that let step to make it look pretty has undone the 
good work. It's fine  if you immediately recognize this as being a homogeneous 
equation because you can divide the top and bottom by x. But here,  it's a lot clearer 
that it's a homogeneous equation because it's already been written in the right form. 
Okay, let's solve it now, since we know what to do. We're going to use as the new 
variable, z = y/x. 

And, as I wrote up there for y prime, we'll substitute z'x + z. And, w ith that, let's 
solve. Let's solve it. The equation becomes z'x + z = (z+1)/(1-z). We want to 
separate variables, so you have to put all the z's on one side. So, this is going to be 
x dz/dx = (z+1)/(1-z) - z. And now, as you rea lize, putting it on the other side, I'm 
going to have to turn it upside down. Just as before, if you have to turn something 
upside down, it's better to comb ine the terms, and make it one tiny little fraction. 

Otherw ise, you are in for quite a lot of mess  if you don't do this nicely. So, z plus one 
minus z, that gets rid of the z's. (1 + z^2) / (1 - z). And so, the question is dz, and 
put this on the other side and turn it upside down. So, that will be (one minus z) 
over (one p lus z squared) on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side, dx over 
x. Well,  that's ready to be integrated just as it stands. The right-hand side integrates 
to be log x. The left-hand side is the sum of two terms. The integral of one over one 
plus z squared is the arc tangent of z, maybe? 

The derivative of this is 1 / (1 + z^2). How about the term z / (1 + z^2)? Well, that 
integrates to be a logarithm. It is more or less the ln (1 + z^2). If I d ifferentiate 
this, I get 1 / (1 + z^2) * 2z, but I w ish I had negative z there  instead. Therefore, I 
should put a minus sign, and  I should multip ly that by ha lf to make it come out right. 

And, this is log x on the right hand side plus, put in that arb itrary constant. And now 
what? Well, let's now fool around w ith it a little bit. The arc tangent, I'm going to 
simultaneously, no, two steps. I have to remember your innocence, although 
probably a lot of you are better ca lculators than I am. I'm going to change this, use 
as many laws of logarithms as possible. I'm going to put this in the exponent, and 
put this on the other side. That's going to turn it into ln(sqrt(1 + z^2)). And, this is 
going to be + ln(x) + c. And, now I'm going to make, go back and remember that z = 
y / x. So, this becomes the tan^(-1) (y/x) equals. 

Now, I combine the logarithms. This is the log of x times this square root, right, 
make one logarithm out of it, and then put z = y/x. And, you see that if you do that, 
it'll be the ln(x sqrt(1 + (y/x)^2)), and what is that? Well, if I put this over x^2 and 
take it out, it cancels that. And, what you are left w ith is the ln(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) + 
c. Now, technically, you have solved the equation, but not morally because, I mean, 
my God, what a mess! Incred ible path. It tells me absolutely nothing. Wow, what is 
the screaming? Change me to polar coordinates. What's the arc tangent of y over x? 

Theta. In polar coordinates it's theta. This is r. So, the curve is theta equals the log 
of r plus a constant. And, I can make even that little better if I exponentiate 
everything, exponentiate both sides, combine this in the usual way, the and what 
you get is that r = c1 e^(theta). That's the curve. It's called an exponentia l spira l, 
and that's what our little boat goes in. And notice, probably if I had set up the 
problem in polar coordinates from the beg inning, nobody would have been able to 
solve it. But, anyone who did would have gotten that answer immed iately. Thanks.
