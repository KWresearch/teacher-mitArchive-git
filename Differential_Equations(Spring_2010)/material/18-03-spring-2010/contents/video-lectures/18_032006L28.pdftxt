18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 28 

The rea l topic is how to solve inhomogeneous systems, but the subtext is what I 
wrote on the board. I think you w ill see that really thinking in terms of matrices 
makes certa in things a  lot easier than they would be otherwise. And  I hope to give 
you a couple of examp les of that today in connection with solving systems of 
inhomogeneous equations. Now, there is a little problem. We have to have a little bit 
of theory ahead of time before that, which I thought rather than interrupt the 
presentation as I try to talk about the inhomogeneous systems it would be better to 
put a little theory in the beginning. I think you will find  it harmless. 

And about half of it you know a lready. The theory I am ta lking about is, in genera l, 
the theory of the systems x' = ax. I w ill just state it when n is equa l to two. A two-
by-two system likely you have had up until now. It is also  true for end-by-end. It is 
just a  little more tedious to write out and to give the definitions. Here is a little two-
by-two system. It is homogeneous. There are no zeros. And it  is not necessary to 
assume this, but since the matrix is going to be constant until the end of the term 
let's assume it in and not go for a spurious generality. So constant matrices like you 
will have on your homework. 

Now, there are two theorems, or maybe three that I want you to know, that you 
need to know in order to understand what is going on. The first one, fortunately, is 
already in your b loodstream, I hope. Let's call  it theorem A. It is simply the one that 
says that the general solution to the system, that system I wrote on the board,  the 
two-by-two system  is what you know it to be. Namely, from a ll the examples that 
you have ca lculated. It is a linear comb ination w ith arbitrary constants for the 
coefficients of two solutions. In other words, to solve it, to find the general solution 
you put a ll your energy into find ing two independent solutions. And then, as soon as 
you  found them,  the genera l one is gotten by combining those with arbitrary 
constants. 

The only thing to specify is what the x1 and the x2 are. "Where," I guess, would be 
the right word to use. Where x1 and x2 are two solutions, but neither must be a 
constant multiple of the other. That is the only thing I want to stress, they have to 
be independent. Or, as it is better to say, linearly independent. Are two linearly 
independent solutions. And department of fuller exp lanation, i.e., neither is a 
constant multiple of the other. 

That  is what it means to be linearly independent. Now,  this theorem I am not going 
to prove. I am just going to say that the proof is a lot  like the one for second order 
equations. It has an easy part and a hard part. The easy part is to show that a ll of 
these guys are solutions. And, in fact, that is a lmost self-evident by looking at the 
equation. For examp le,  if x1 and x2, each of those solve that equation so does their 
sum because, when you plug it in, you differentiate the sum by differentiating each 
term and add ing. And here A(x1 + x2) = Ax1 + Ax2. 

In other words, you are using the linearity and the superposition principle. It is easy 
to show that a ll of these, well, maybe I should actually write something down instead 
of just ta lking. Easy that a ll these are solutions. Every one of those guys, regardless 
of what c1 and c2 is, is a solution. That is  linearity, if I use that buzz word, plus the 
superposition principle, that the sum of two solutions is a solution. 

The hard thing is not to show that these are solutions but to show that these are all 
the solutions, that there are no other solutions. No matter how you do that it is hard. 
The hard thing is that there are no other solutions. These are a ll. Now, you could sort 
of say, well, it has two arbitrary constants  in it. That  is sort of a  rough and ready 
reason, but it is not considered adequate by mathematicians. And, in  fact, I could go 
into a song and dance as to just why it is inadequate. But we have other things to 
do, bigger fish to fry, as they say. Let's fry a fish. No, we have another theorem first. 

This one it is mostly the words that I am interested in. Once again, we have our old 
friend the Wronskian back. The Wronskian of what? Of two solutions. It is the 
Wronskian of the solution x1 and x2. They don't, by the way, have to be 
independent. Just two solutions to the system. And what is it? Hey, didn't we a lready 
have a Wronskian? Yeah. Forget about that one for the moment. Postpone it for a 
minute. This is a determinant, just like the old one way. 

This is going to be a great lecture. (x1, x2). Now what is this? x1  is a column vector, 
right? x2  is a column vector. Two things in it. Two things in it. Together they make a 
square matrix. And this means it is determinant. It is the determinant of this. It is a 
determinant, in other words, of a square matrix. And  that is what it is. I will change 
this equality. To indicate it is a definition, I will put the colon there, which is what 
you add, to indicate this is only equal because I say so. It is a definition, in other 
words. Now, there is a connection between this and the earlier Wronskian which I, 
unfortunately, cannot expla in to you because you are going to expla in it to me. 

I gave it to you as part one of your homework problem. Make sure you do it. And, if 
you cannot remember what the old Wronskian is, please look it up in the book. Don't 
look it up in the solution to the problem. If you do that you will learn something. 
Then you will see how, in a certa in sense, this is a more genera l definition than I 
gave you before. The one I gave you before is, in a certa in sense, a specia l case of 
it. 

Now that is just the definition. There is a theorem. And the theorem is going to look 
just like the one we had for second order equations, if you can remember back that 
far. The theorem is that if these are two solutions there are only two possib ilities for 
the Wronskian. So either or. Either the Wronskian is -- Now, the Wronskian, these 
are functions, the column vectors are the solutions, so those are functions of the 
variable t, so are these. The Wronskian as a whole is a function of the independent 
variable t after you have ca lculated out that determinant. I will write it now this way 
to ind icate that it s a function of t. Either the Wronskian is --

One possibility is identically zero. That is zero for a ll values of t, in other words. And 
this happens if x1 and x2 are not linearly independent. Usua lly people just say 
dependent and hope they are interpreted correctly. Are dependent. But since I d id 
not exp lain what dependent means, I w ill say it. Not linearly independent. I know 
that is horrib le, but nobody has figured out another way to say it. That is one 
possibility, or the opposite of this is never zero  for any t va lue. 

I mean a norma l function is zero here and  there, and the rest of the time not zero. 
Well, not this Wronskian. You only have two choices. Either it is zero all the time or it 
is never zero. It is like the function e^t. In other words, an exponentia l which is 
never zero, always positive and never zero. Or, it could be a constant. Anyway, it 
has to be a function which is never zero. And this happens in the other case, so this 
is --

There  is no p lace to write it. This is the case if x1 and x2 are independent, by which I 
mean linearly independent. It is just I didn't have room to write it. That is pretty 
much the end of the theory. And now, let's start in on the matrices. The basic new 
matrix we are going to be ta lking about this period and next one on Monday a lso is 
the way that most peop le who work with systems actually look at the solutions to 
systems, so it is important you learn this word and this way of looking at it. What 
they do is look not at each solution separately, as we have been doing up until now. 
They put them a ll together in a single matrix. 

And it is the properties of that matrix that they study and try to do the ca lculations 
using. And that matrix is called the fundamental matrix for the system. Sometimes 
people don't bother writing in the whole system. They just say it is a fundamental 
matrix for A because, after a ll, A is the only thing that is varying there. Once you 
know A, you know what the system is. So what is this guy? 

Well, it is a two-by-two matrix. And it is the most harmless thing. It is the precursor 
of the Wronskian. It is what the Wronskian was before the determinant was taken. In 
other words, it is the matrix whose two columns are those two solutions. The other 
question is what we are going to call it. I kept trying everything and settled on 
calling it cap ital X because I think that is the one that guides you in the calculations 
the best. 

This is definition two, so colon equa lity. Notice I am not using vertica l lines now 
because that would mean a determinant. It is the matrix whose columns are two 
independent solutions. Is that a ll? Yeah. You just put them side-by-side. Why? That 
will come out. Why should one do this? Well, first of all, in order not to  interrupt the 
basic ca lculation that I want to make with this during the period, it has two basic 
properties that we are going to need during this period. These are the properties. 

Just two. And one is obvious and the other you will think, I hope, is a little less 
familiar. I think you w ill see there is nothing to it. It is just a way of ta lking, rea lly. 
The first  is the one that  is already embedded in the theorem, namely that the 
determinant of the fundamental matrix is not zero for any t. Why? Well, I just told 
you it wasn't. This is the Wronskian. The Wronskian  is never zero? Why is it never 
zero? Well, because I said these columns had to be independent solutions. So this is 
not just not zero, it is never zero. It is not zero  for any va lue of t. That is good. As 
you will see, we are going to need that property. But the other one is a little 
stranger. 

The only thing  I can say is, get used to it. Namely that X prime equa ls AX. Now, why 
is that strange? That is not the same as this. This is a column vector. That is a 
square matrix and this is a column vector. This is not a column vector. This is a 
square matrix. This is what is called a matrix differentia l equation where the variab le 
is not a single x or a column vector of a set of x's like the x and the y. It is a whole 
matrix. 

Well, first of all, I should say what is it saying? This  is a two-by-two matrix. When I 
multip ly them I get a two-by-two matrix. What is this? This is a two-by-two matrix, 
every entry of which has been differentiated. That is what it means to put that prime 
there. To differentiate a matrix means nothing fancy. It just means differentiate 
every entry. It is just like to d ifferentiate a vector (x, y), to make a velocity vector 
you differentiate the x and the y. Well, a column vector is a special kind of matrix. 
The definition app lies to any matrix. 

Well, why is that so? I state it as a property, but I will continue it by giving you, so 
to speak, the proof of it. In  fact, there is nothing in this. It is nothing more than a 
little matrix calculation of the most primitive kind. Namely, what does this mean? 
Let's try to undo that. What does the left-hand side rea lly mean? Well, if that is what 
x means, the left-hand side must mean the derivative of the first column. 

That  is its first column. And the derivative of the second column. That is what it 
means to d ifferentiate the matrix X. You differentiate each column separately. And to 
differentiate the column you need to differentiate every function in it. Well, what 
does the right-hand side mean? Well, I am supposed to take A[x1, x2]. Now, I don't 
know how to prove this, except ask you to think about it. 

Or, I could write  it all out here. But think of this as a bing, bing, bing, bing. And this 
is a b ing, bing. And this is a bong, bong. How do I do the multip lication? In other 
words, what is in the first column of the matrix? Well, it is dah, dah, and the  lower 
thing is dah, dah. In other words, it is A times x1. Shut your eyes and visua lize it. 
Got it? Dah, dah  is the top entry, and dah, dah is the bottom entry. It is what you 
get by multip lying A by the column vector x1. And the same way the other guy is --

-- what you get by multip lying A by the column vector x2. This is just matrix 
multip lication. That  is the law of matrix multiplication. That is how you multiply 
matrices. Well, good, but where does this get us? What does it mean for those two 
guys to be equa l? That is going to happen, if and only if x1 prime is equal to A x1. 
This guy equals that guy. And similarly for the x2's. The end result is that this 
matrix, saying that the fundamental matrix satisfies this matrix d ifferential equation 
is only a way of saying, in one breath, that its two columns are both solutions to the 
orig ina l system. 

It is, so to speak, an efficient way of turning these two equations into a single 
equation by making a matrix. I guess it is time,  fina lly, to come to the top ic of the 
lecture. I said the thing the matrices were going to be used  for is solving 
inhomogeneous systems, so let's take a look at those. I thought I would g ive you an 
example. Inhomogeneous systems. Well, what is one going  to look like? So  far what 
we have done  is, up until now has been so lving, we spent essentia lly two weeks 
solving and p lotting the solutions to homogeneous systems. There was nothing over 
there. And homogeneous systems, in fact, w ith constant coefficients. 

Stuff that looked like that that we abbreviated w ith matrices. Now, to make the 
system inhomogeneous what I do is add the extra term on the right-hand side, 
which is some function of t. Except, I w ill have to have two  functions of t because I 
have two equations. Now it is inhomogeneous. And what makes it inhomogeneous is 
the fact that these are not zero anymore. There  is something there. Functions of t 
are there. 

These are g iven functions of t like exponentials, polynomials, the usual stuff you 
have on the right-hand side of the differential equation. What is confusing here is 
that when we stud ied second order equations it was homogeneous if the right-hand 
side was zero, and if there was something else there it was inhomogeneous. 
Unfortunately, I have stuck this stuff on the right-hand side so it is not quite so clear 
anymore. 

It has got to look like that, in other words. How would the matrix abbreviation look? 
Well, the left-hand side is x prime. The homogenous part is ax, just as it has always 
been. The only extra part is those functions r. And this is a column vector, after the 
multip lication this is a column vector, what is left is column vector. Now, exp licitly it 
is a function of t, g iven by explicit functions of t, again, like exponentia ls. 

Or, they could be fancy functions. That is the thing we are trying to solve. Why don't 
I put it up in green? Our new and better and improved system. Think back to what 
we did when we studied inhomogeneous equations. We are not talking about 
systems but just a sing le equation. What we did was the main theorem -- I guess 
there are going to be three theorems today, not just two. Theorem C. Is that right? 
Yes, A, B. We are up to C. Theorem C says that the general solution, that is, the 
general solution to  the system, is equal to the complimentary function, which is the 
general solution to x prime equals Ax, --

-- the homogeneous equation, in other words, plus, what am I going to ca ll it? (x)p, 
right you are, a particular solution. But the principle is the same and is proved 
exactly the same way. It is just linearity and superposition. The linearity of the 
orig ina l system and the superposition principle. The essence  is that to solve this 
inhomogeneous system, what we have to do is find a particular solution. This part I 
already know how to do. We have been doing that for two weeks. The new thing is to 
find this. 

Now, if you remember back before spring break, most of the work in solving the 
second order equation was in  find ing that particular solution. You quickly enough 
learned how to solve the homogeneous equation, but there was no rea l genera l 
method  for finding this. We had an exponential input theorem w ith some 
modifications to it. We took a week's detour in Fourier series to see how to do it for 
period ic functions or functions defined on finite intervals. There were other 
techniques which I d id not get around to show ing you, techniques involving the so-
called method of undetermined coefficients. Although, some of you peaked in your 
book and learned it from there. 

But the work is in  find ing (x)p. The miracle that occurs here, by contrast, is that it 
turns out to be easy to  find (x)p. And easy in this further sense that I do not have to 
restrict the kind of function I use. For examp le, the second homework prob lem I 
have given you, the second part two homework problem. You will see how to use 
systems. For example, to solve this simple equation, I will write it out for you, 
consider that equation, tan(t). What technique will you apply to solve that? In other 
words, suppose you wanted to find a particular solution to that. The right-hand side 
is not an exponential. It is not a polynomial. 

It is not  like sin(bt) or cos(bt). I could use the Laplace transform. No, because you 
don't know how to take the L(tan(t)). Neither,  for that matter, do I. Fourier series. 
Not a good choice for a function that goes to  infinity at pi over two. So you cannot do 
this until you do your homework. Now you will be ab le to do it. In other words, one 

of the big things is not only will I give you a  formula  for the Xp but that formula will 
work even for tangent t, any function at a ll. 

Well, I thought I would try to put a little meat on the bones of the inhomogeneous 
systems by actually g iving you a physical problem so we would actually be ab le to 
solve a physical prob lem instead of just demonstrate a solution method. Here is a 
mixing problem. Just to illustrate what makes a system of equations inhomogeneous, 
here at two ug ly tanks. I am not going to draw these carefully, but they are both 1 
liter. And they are connected by pipes. And I won't bother opening holes in them. 
There  is a pipe w ith fluids flowing back there and this d irection it is flowing this way, 
but that is not the end. 

The end is there is stuff coming in to both of them. And I think I w ill just make it 
coming out of this one. There  is something realistic. The numbers 2, 3, 2. Let's start 
there and see what the others have to be. So these are flow rates. One liter tanks. 
The flow rates are in, let's say, liters per hour. And I have some dissolved substance 
in, so here is going to be x salt in there and the same chemica l in there, whatever it 
is. x is the amount of sa lt, let's say, in tank one. 

And y, the same thing in tank two. Now, if you have stuff flow ing unequally this way, 
you must have ba lance. You have to make sure that neither tank is getting emptied 
or bursting and explod ing. What is flowing in? What is x? Three is going out, two  is 
coming in, so  this has to be one in order that tank x stay full and not explode. And 
how about y? How much is going out? Two there and two here. Four is going out, 
three is coming in. This also has to be one. Those are just the flow rates of water or 
the liquid that is coming in. Now, the only thing  I am going to specify is the 
concentration of what is coming in. 

Here the concentration is 5 e^(-t). And that is what makes the problem 
inhomogeneous. Here the concentration is going to be zero. In other words, pure 
water is flowing in here to create the liquid ba lance. Here, on the other hand, sa lt 
solution is flow ing in but w ith a steadily declining concentration. So, what is the 
system? Well, you have set it up exactly the way you d id when you studied first 
order equations. It is inflow minus outflow. What is the outflow? The outflow is a ll in 
this pipe. The flow  rates are liters per hour. Three liters per hour flowing out. How 
much sa lt does that represent? 

It is negative three times the concentration of salt. But the concentration, notice, 
equa ls x / 1. In other words, x represents both the concentration and the amount. 
So I don't have to d istinguish. If I had made it two liter tanks then I would have had 
to d ivide this by two. I am cheating, but it is enough already. x prime equals minus 
3x. That is what is going out. What is coming in? Well, 2y is coming in. Concentration 
here. What is coming in? Is it y 2 liter? P lus what is coming in from the outside. We 
have to add that in, and that will be 5 e^(-t). How about y? y prime is chang ing. 
What comes in from x? 

That  is 3x. What goes out? Well, two is leaving here and two is leaving here. It 
doesn't matter that they are going out through separate p ipes. They are both going 
out. It is minus 4, 2 and 2. How about the inhomogeneous term? There is one 
coming in, but there is no salt in it. Therefore, that is not chang ing. What is coming 
through that pipe is necessary for the liquid balance. But it has no effect whatsoever. 
I w ill put a zero here but, of course, you don't have to put that in. This  is now an 
inhomogeneous system. In other words, the system is x prime equals this matrix, 

negative 3, the same sort of stuff we always had, plus the  inhomogeneous term 
which is the column vector [5 e^(-t), 0]. 

It is the presence of this term that makes this system inhomogeneous. And what 
that corresponds to is this little closed system being attacked  from the outside by 
these external pipes which are bringing salt in. Without those, of course the balance 
would be a ll wrong. I would have to change this to three and cut that out, I guess. 
But then, it would be just a simp le homogenous system. It is these pipes that make 
it inhomogeneous. Now, I should start to solve that. I did this just to illustrate where 
a system might come from. Before I solve that, what I want to do is, of course, is 
solve it in genera l. In other words, how do you solve this in general? Because I 
promised you that you would be able to do in general, regardless of what sort of 
functions were  in the r of t, that column vector. So let's do it. 

First of all, you have to learn the name of the method. This method is for solving x 
prime equa ls Ax. It is a method  for finding a particular solution. Of course, to 
actually solve it then you have to add the comp limentary function. We are looking for 
a particular solution  for this system. Now, the whole cleverness of the method, which 
I think was discovered a coup le hundred years ago by, I think, Lagrange, I am not 
sure. The method is ca lled variation of parameters. 

I am g iving you that so that when you forget you w ill be ab le to look it up and be 
indexes to some advanced engineering mathematics book or something, whatever is 
on your shelf. But, if course, you won't remember the name either so maybe this 
won't work. Variation of parameters, I will exp la in to you why it is ca lled that. All the 
cleverness is in the very first  line. If you could  remember the very first line then I 
trust you to do the rest yourself. 

I don't know any motivation for this first step, but mathematics is supposed to be 
mysterious anyway. It keeps me eating. It says, look for a solution and there will be 
one of the follow ing form. Now, it w ill look exactly like -- Look carefully because it is 
going to be gone in a moment. It will look exactly like this. But, of course, it cannot 
be this because this solves the homogeneous system. If I p lug this in with these as 
constants it cannot possibly be a particular solution to this because it w ill stop there 
and satisfy that w ith r equals zero. 

The whole trick is you think of these are parameters which are now variable. 
Constants that are varying. That is why it is ca lled variation of parameters. You think 
of these, in other words, as functions of t. We are going  to look for a solution which 
has the form, since they are functions of t, I don't want to call them c1 and c2 
anymore. I will ca ll them v because that is what most peop le call them, v or u, 
sometimes. 

The method says look for a solution of that form. The variation parameters, these 
are the parameters that are now varying instead of being constants. Now, if you take 
it in that form and start trying to substitute into  the equation you are going to get a 
mess. I think I was wrong in saying I could trust you from this point on. I will take 
the first step from you, and then I could trust you to do the rest after that first step. 
The first step is to change the way this looks by using the fundamenta l matrix. 
Remember what the fundamenta l matrix was? Its entries were the two columns of 
solutions. These are solutions to the homogeneous system. 

And I am going to write it using the fundamenta l matrix as, now thinks about it. The 
fundamenta l matrix has columns x1 and x2. Your instinct might be using matrix 
multip lication to put the v1 and the v2 here, but that won't work. You have to put 
them here. This says the same thing as that. Let's just take a second out to 
calculate. The x is going to look like (x1, y1). That is my first solution. My second 
solution, here is the fundamental matrix, is (x2, y2). And I am multiplying this on 
the right by (v1, v2). Does it come out right? Look. What is it? 

The top is x1v1 + x2v2. The top, x1v1 + x2v2. It is in the wrong order, but 
multip lication is commutative, fortunately. And the same way the bottom thing will 
be v1y1 + v2y2. If I had written  it on the other side instead, which is tempting 
because the v's occur on the left here, that won't work. What w ill I get? I w ill get 
v1x1 + v2y1, which is not at all what I want. You must put it on the right. But this is 
a very important thing. This is going to plague us on Monday, too. It must be written 
on the right and not on the left as a column vector. The rest of the program is very 
simple. I will write it out as a program. 

Substitute into the system, into that, in other words, and see what v has to be. That 
is what we are  looking for. We know what the x1 and x2 are. It is a question of what 
those coefficients are. And see what v is. Let's do it. Let's substitute. Let's see. The 
system is x' = Ax +  r. I want to put in (x)p, this proposed particular solution. And it 
is a fundamental matrix, and the v is unknown. How do I d ifferentiate the product of 
two matrices? 

You differentiate the product of two matrices using the product rule that you learned 
the first day of 18.01. Trust me. Let's do it. I am going to substitute in. In other 
words, here is my (x)p, (x)p, and I am going to write in what that is. The left-hand 
side is the derivative of, X' v + X v'. Notice that one of these is a column vector and 
the other is a square matrix. That is perfectly Okay. Any two matrices which are the 
rate shape so you can multiply them  together, if you want to d ifferentiate their 
product, in other words, if the entries are functions of t it  is the product rule. The 
derivative of this times time p lus that times the derivative of this. You have to keep 
them in the right order. You are not a llowed to shuffle them around carelessly. So 
that is that. What is  it equal to? 

Well, the right-hand side is A. And now I substitute just (x)p in, so that is X times v 
plus r. Is this progress? What  is v? It looks like a mess but it is not. Why not? It is 
because this is not any old matrix X. This is a matrix whose columns are solutions to 
the system. And what does that do? That means X prime satisfies that matrix 
differentia l equation. X' = Ax. And, by a little miracle, the v  is tagg ing along in both 
cases. This cancels that and now there is very little left. 

The conclusion, therefore, is that Xv = r. What is v? It is v that we are looking for, 
right? You have to solve a matrix equation, now. This is a square matrix so you have 
to do it by inverting the matrix. You don't just sloppily d ivide. You multiply on which 
side by what matrix? Choice of left or right. You multip ly by the inverse matrix on 
the left or on the right? It has to be on the left. Multiply both sides of the equation by 
X inverse on the left, and then you will get v = X^(-1) r. How do I know the X 
inverse exists? Does X inverse exist? 

For a matrix inverse to exist, the matrix's determinant must be not zero. Why is the 
determinant of this not zero? Because its columns are independent solutions. Of 
course this is not right. I forgot the prime here. I am not failing this course after a ll. 

v' equals that. This is done by d ifferentiating each entry in the column vector. And, 
therefore, we should integrate it. It will be the integra l, just the ord inary anti-
derivative of x^(-1)  r. This is a column vector. 

The entries are functions of t. You simply integrate each of those functions in turn. 
So integrate each entry. There is my v. Sorry, you cannot tell the v's from the r's 
here. And so, fina lly, the particular solution is (x)p is equa l to -- It is rea lly not bad 
at a ll. It is equa l to X times v. It's equal to X Integral of [X^(-1) r dt]. Now, actually, 
there is not much work to doing that. Once you have solved the homogeneous 
system and gotten the fundamenta l matrix, taking the inverse of a two-by-two 
matrix is a lmost trivial. You flip those two and you change the signs of these two and 
you divide by the determinant. 

You multiply it by r. And the hard part is if you can do the integration. If not, you 
just leave the  integral sign the way you have learned to do in this silly course and 
you still have the answer. What about the arbitrary constant of integration? The 
answer is you don't need to put it in. Just find one particular solution. It is good 
enough. You don't have to put in the arb itrary constants of integration. 

Because they are already  in the comp limentary function here. Therefore, you don't 
have to add them. I am sorry I didn't get a chance to actually solve that. I will have 
to let it go. The recitations will do it on Tuesday, will solve that particular problem, 
which means you will, in effect.
