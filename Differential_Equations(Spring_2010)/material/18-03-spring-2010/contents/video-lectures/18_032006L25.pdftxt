18.03 Differentia l Equations, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 25 

The last time I spent solving a system of equations dealing with the chilling of this 
hardboiled egg being put in an ice bath. We called T1 the temperature of the yoke 
and T2 the temperature of the white. What I am going to do is revisit that same 
system of equations, but basica lly the topic for today is to learn to solve that system 
of equations by a completely d ifferent method. It is the method  that is normally used 
in practice. Elimination is used mostly by people who have forgotten how to do it any 
other way. Now, in order to make it a  little more genera l, I am not going to use the 
dependent variables T1 and T2 because they suggest temperature a little too closely. 
Let's change them to neutral variables. 

I w ill use x = T1, and for T2 I w ill just use y. I am not going to re-derive anything. I 
am not going to resolve anything. I am not going to repeat anything of what I did 
last time, except to write down to remind you what the system was in terms of these 
variables, the system we derived using the particular conductivity constants, two and 
three, respectively. The system was this one, -2x + 2y. 

And the y' = 2x - 5y. And so we solved this by elimination. We got a single second-
order equation with constant coefficients, which we solved in the usua l way. From 
that I derived what the x was, from that we derived what the y was, and then I put 
them all together. I w ill just remind you what the final solution was when written out 
in terms of arbitrary constants. It was c1 e^(-t) + c2 e^(-6t), and y = c1/2 e^(-t) -
2 c2 e^(-6t). That was the solution we got. 

And then I went on to put in initia l conditions, but we are not going to exp lore that 
aspect of it today. We w ill in a week or so. This was the genera l solution because it 
had two arb itrary constants in it. What I want to do now is revisit this and do it by a 
different method, which makes heavy use of matrices. That is a prerequisite for this 
course, so I am assuming that you reviewed a little bit about matrices. And it is in 
your book. Your book puts in a nice little review section. Two-by-two and three-by-
three will be good enough for 18.03 mostly because I don't want you to ca lculate all 
night on b igger matrices, b igger systems. So nothing serious, matrix multiplication, 
solving systems of linear equations, end-by-end systems. 

I w ill remind you at the appropriate places today of what it is you need to remember. 
The very first thing we are going to do is, let's see. I haven't figured out the color 
coding for this lecture yet, but let's make this system  in green and the solution can 
be in purple. Invisible purple, but I have a lot of it. Let's abbreviate,  first of a ll, the 
system using matrices. I am going to make a column vector out of (x, y). Then you 
differentiate a column vector by differentiating each component. I can write the left-
hand side of the system as (x, y)'. How about the right-hand side? 

Well, I say I can just write the matrix of coefficients to ( -2, 2; 2, -5)(x, y). And I say 
that this matrix equation says exactly the same thing as that green equation and, 
therefore, it is legitimate to put it up in green, too. The top here is x'. What is the 
top here? After I multiply these two I get a column vector. And what is its top entry? 

It is -2x + 2y. There it is. And the bottom entry the same way is 2x - 5y, just as it is 
down there. Now, what I want to do is, well, maybe I should translate the solution. 
What does the solution look like? 

We got that, too. How am I going  to write this as a matrix equation? Actua lly, if I 
told you to use matrices, use vectors, the point at which you might be most hesitant 
is this one right here, the very next step. Because how you should write it is 
extremely well-concea led in this notation. But the point is, this is a column vector 
and I am add ing together two column vectors. And what is in each one of the column 
vectors? 

Think of these two things as a column vector. Pull out all the scalars from them that 
you can. Well, you see that c1  is a common  factor of both entries and so is e^(-t), 
that function. Now, if I pull both of those out of the vector, what is left of the vector? 
Well, you cannot even see it. What is left is a 1 up here and a one-half there. So I 
am going to write that in the follow ing form. I w ill put out the c1, it's the common 
factor in both, and put that out front. Then I w ill put in the guts of the vector, even 
though you cannot see  it, the column vector (1, 1/2). And then I will put the other 
sca lar function in back. The only reason for putting one of these in  front and one  in 
back is visual so to make it easy to read. There is no other reason. 

You could put the c1 here, you could put it here, you could put the e^(-t) in front if 
you want to, but peop le w ill fire you. Don't do that. Write it the standard way 
because that is the way that it is easiest to read. The constants out front, the 
functions behind, and the column vector of numbers in the middle. And so the other 
one w ill be written how? Well, here, that one is a little more transparent. 

c2, 1, 2 and the other thing is e^(-6t). There is our solution. That is going to need a 
lot of purp le, but I have it. And now  I want to ta lk about how the new method of 
solving the equation. It is based just on the same idea as the way we solve second-
order equations. Yes, question. Oh, here. Sorry. This should be negative two. Thanks 
very much. What I am going to use is a trial solution. Remember when we had a 
second-order equation w ith constant coefficients the very first thing I d id was I said 
we are going to try a solution of the form e^(rt). Why that? Well, because Oiler 
thought of it and it has been known  for 200 or 300 years that that is the thing you 
should do. 

Well, this has not been known nearly as long because matrices were only invented 
around 1880 or so, and people d id not really use them to solve systems of 
differentia l equations until the midd le of the last century, 1950-1960. If you look at 
books written in 1950, they won't even ta lk about systems of d ifferentia l equations, 
or ta lk very little anyway and they won't solve them using matrices. This is only 50 
years old. I mean, my God, in mathematics that is very up to date, particularly 
elementary mathematics. Anyway,  the method of solving is going to use as a trial 
solution. Now, if you were left to your own devices you might say, well, let's try x = 
a1 e^(lambda1 t) and y = a2 e^(lambda2 t). 

Now, if you try that, it is a sensib le thing to try, but it will turn out not to work. And 
that is the reason I have written out this particular solution, so we can see what 
solutions look like. The essential point is here is the basic solution I am trying to find. 
Here is another one. Their form is a column vector of constants. But they both use 
the same exponentia l factor, which is the point. In other words, I should not use 
here, in my tria l solution, two different lambdas, I should use the same lambda. And 

so the way to write the trial solution is (x, y) equals two unknown numbers, that or 
that or whatever, times e to a single unknown exponent factor. 

Let's call it lambda t. It is called lambda. It is called  r. It is called m. I have never 
seen it called anything but one of those three things. I am using  lambda. Your book 
uses lambda. It is a common choice. Let's stick with it. Now what is the next step? 
Well, we p lug into the system. Substitute into the system. What are we going to get? 
Well, let's do it. F irst of all, I have to differentiate. The  left-hand side asks me to 
differentiate this. How do I d ifferentiate this? Column vector times a function. Well, 
the column vector acts as a constant. And I differentiate that. That is lambda 
e^(lambda t). 

So the (x, y)' = (a1, a2) e^( lambda t) lambda. Now, it is ugly to put the lambda 
afterwards because it is a number so you should put it in  front, aga in, to make 
things easier to read. But this lambda comes from d ifferentiating e^( lambda t) and 
using the chain rule. This much is the left-hand side. That is the derivative (x, y) 
prime. 

I d ifferentiate the x and I differentiated the y. How about the right-hand side. Well, 
the right-hand side is (-2, 2; 2, -5) times what? Well, times (x, y), which is (a1, a2) 
e^(lambda t). Now, the same thing that happened a month or a month and a half 
ago happens now. The whole point of making that substitution is that the e^( lambda 
t), the function part of it drops out completely. 

And one is left w ith what? An algebraic equation to be solved  for lambda a1 and a2. 
In other words, by means of that substitution, and it basica lly uses the fact that the 
coefficients are constant, what you have done is reduced the problem of calculus, of 
solving d ifferential equations, to solving algebraic equations. In some sense that is 
the only method there is, unless you do numerical stuff. You reduce the calculus to 
algebra. The Lap lace transform is exactly the same thing. All the work is algebra. 
You turn the orig inal differentia l equation into an algebraic equation  for Y(s), you 
solve it, and then you use more a lgebra to find out what the original little y(t) was. It 
is not d ifferent here. 

So let's solve this system of equations. Now, the whole prob lem with solving  this 
system, first of all, what is the system? Let's write it out explicitly. Well, it is rea lly 
two equations, isn't it? The first one says lambda a1 = -2a1 + 2a2. That is the first 
one. The other one says lambda a2 = 2a1 - 5a2. 

Now, purely,  if you want to classify that, that is two equations and three variab les, 
three unknowns. The a1, a2, and lambda are all unknown. And, unfortunately, if you 
want to classify them correctly, they are nonlinear equations because they are made 
nonlinear by the fact that you have multiplied two of the variables. Well,  if you sit 
down and try to hack away at solving those without a p lan, you are not going to get 
anywhere. It is going to be a mess. Also, two equations and three unknowns is 
indeterminate. You can solve three equations and three unknowns and get a definite 
answer, but two equations and three unknowns usua lly have an infinity of solutions. 
Well, at this point it is the only idea that is required. 

Well, this was a little idea, but I assume one would think of that. And the idea that is 
required here is, I think, not so unnatura l, it is not to view these a1, a2, and lambda 
as equal. Not a ll variables are created equal. Some are more equa l than others. a1 
and a2 are definitely equa l to each other, and let's relegate lambda to the 

background. In other words, I am going to think of lambda as just a parameter. I am 
going to demote it from the status of variable to parameter. If I demoted it further it 
would just be an unknown constant. That is as bad as you can be. I am going to 
focus my attention on the a1, a2 and sort of view the lambda as a nuisance. Now, as 
soon as I do that, I see that these equations are linear if I just look at them as 
equations in a1 and a2. 

And moreover, they are not just linear, they are homogenous. Because if I think of 
lambda just as a parameter, I should  rewrite the equations this way. I am going to 
subtract this and move the left-hand side to the right side, and it is going to look like 
(-2 - lambda)a1 + 2a1 = 0. And the same way for the other one. It  is going to be 
2a1 + (-5 - lambda)a2 = 0. That is a pa ir of simultaneous linear equations for 
determining a1 and a2, and the coefficients involved are parameter lambda. Now, 
what is the point of doing that? 

Well, now the point is whatever you learned about linear equations, you should have 
learned the most fundamenta l theorem of linear equations. The main theorem is that 
you have a square system of homogeneous equations, this is a two-by-two system 
so it  is square, it always has the trivia l solution, of course, a1, a2 equals zero. Now, 
we don't want that trivial solution because if a1 and a2 are zero, then so are x and y 
zero. 

Now that is a solution. Unfortunately, it is of no  interest. If the solution were x, y 
zero, it corresponds to the fact that this is an ice bath. The yoke is at zero, the white 
is at zero and it stays that way for all time until the ice melts. So that is the solution 
we don't want. We don't want the trivia l solution. Well, when does it have a 
nontrivial solution? Nontrivial means non-zero, in other words. 

If and only if this determinant is zero. In other words, by using that theorem on 
linear equations, what we find is there is a cond ition that lambda must satisfy, an 
equation in lambda in order that we would be ab le to find non-zero va lues for a1 and 
a2. Let's write it out. I w ill recopy it over here. What was  it? Negative 2 minus 
lambda, two, here it was 2 and -5 - lambda. All right. You have to expand the 
determinant. In other words, we are trying to find out for what va lues of lambda is 
this determinant zero. 

Those will be the good values which lead to nontrivia l solutions for the a's. This is the 
equation lambda plus 2. See, this is minus that and minus that, the product of the 
two minus ones is plus one. So it is (lamda + 2)(lambda + 5), which is the product 
of the two d iagona l elements, minus the product of the two anti-diagona l elements, 
which is 4, is equal to zero. 

And if I write that out, what is that, that is the equation lambda^2 + 7 lambda, 5 
lambda plus 2 lambda, and then the constant term is 10 minus 4 which  is 6. How 
many of you have long enough memories, two-day memories that you remember 
that equation? When I d id the method of elimination, it led to exactly the same 
equation except it had  r's  in it instead of lambda. And this equation, therefore, is 
given the same name and another color. Let's make  it sa lmon. 

And it is ca lled the characteristic equation for this method. All right. Now I am going 
to use now the word from  last time. You factor this. From the factorization we get its 
root easily enough. The roots are lambda = -1 and lamda = -6 by factoring the 
equation. Now what I am supposed to do? You have to keep the different parts of the 

method together. Now I have found the only va lues of  lambda for which I will be ab le 
to find nonzero va lues for the a1 and a2. For each of those va lues of lambda, I now 
have to find the corresponding a1 and a2. Let's do them one at a time. Let's take 
first lamba = -1. 

My prob lem is now to find a1 and a2. Where am I going to find them from? Well, 
from that system of equations over there. I w ill recopy it over here. What is the 
system? The hardest part of this is dealing with multip le minus signs, but you had 
experience with that in determinants so you know all about that. In other words, 
there is the system of equations over there. Let's recopy them here. Minus 2, minus 
minus 1 makes minus 1. What's the other coefficient? It is just pla in old 2. Good. 
There  is my first equation. And when I substitute lamba = -1 for the second 
equation, what do you get? 

2 a1 p lus negative 5 minus negative 1 makes negative 4. There is my system that 
will find me a1 and a2. What  is the first thing you notice about it? You immediately 
notice that this system is fake because this second equation is twice the first one. 
Something is wrong. No, something  is right. If that d id not happen, if the second 
equation were not a constant multiple of the first one then the only solution of the 
system would be a1 equals zero, a2 equals zero because the determinant of the 
coefficients would not be zero. 

The whole function of this exercise was to find the value of lambda, negative 1, for 
which the system would be redundant and, therefore, would have a nontrivial 
solution. Do you get that? In other words, calculate the system out, just as I have 
done here, you have an automatic check on the method. If one equation is not a 
constant multiple of the other you made a mistake. You don't have the right value of 
lambda or you substituted into the system wrong, which is frankly a more common 
error. Go back, recheck first the substitution, and if convinced that  is right then 
recheck where you got lambda from. But here everything  is going fine so we can now 
find out what the va lue of a1 and a2 are. 

You don't have to go through a b ig song and dance for this since most of the time 
you will have two-by-two equations and now and then three-by-three. For two-by-
two a ll you do is, since we really have the same equation twice, to get a solution I 
can assign one of the variab les any va lue and then simp ly solve for the other. The 
natural thing to do is to make a2 equal one, then I won't need fractions and then a1 
will be a2. 

So the solution is (2, 1). I am only trying to  find one solution. Any constant multiple 
of this would also be a solution, as long as it wasn't zero, zero which is the trivial 
one. And, therefore, this is a solution to this system of algebraic equations. And the 
solution to the whole system of d ifferential equations is, this is only the (a1, a2) 
part. I have to add to it, as a factor, lambda is negative, therefore, e^(-t). There is 
our purp le thing. 

See how  I got it? Starting w ith the tria l solution, I first found out through this 
procedure what the lambda's have to be. Then I took the lambda and found what the 
corresponding a1 and a2 that went with it and then made up my solution out of that. 
Now, quickly I w ill do the same thing for lambda = -6. Each one of these must be 
treated separately. They are separate problems and you are looking for separate 
solutions. Lambda equa ls negative 6. What do I do? How do my equations look now? 
Well, the first one is minus 2 minus negative 6 makes p lus 4. 

It is 4a1 + 2a2 = 0. Then I hold my breath while I ca lculate the second one to see if 
it comes out to be a constant multip le. I get 2a1 plus negative 5 minus negative 6, 
which makes plus 1. And, indeed, one is a constant multiple of the other. I really 
only have on equation there. I will just write down immed iately now what the 
solution is to the system. Well, the (a1, a2) w ill be what? Now, it is more natura l to 
make a1 equal 1 and then solve to get an integer for a2. If a1 is 1,  then a2 is 
negative 2. 

And I should multiply that by e^(-6t) because negative 6 is the corresponding value. 
There  is my other one. And now  there is a superposition princip le, which if I get a 
chance will prove for you at the end of the hour. If not, you w ill have to do it yourself 
for homework. Since this is a linear system of equations, once you have two 
separate solutions, neither a constant multip le of the other, you can multiply each 
one of these by a constant and it will still be a solution. 

You can add them together and that w ill still be a solution, and that gives the general 
solution. The genera l solution is the sum of these two, an arbitrary constant. I am 
going to change the name since I don't want to confuse it w ith the c1 I used before, 
times the first solution which is (2, 1) e to the negative t plus c2, another arb itrary 
constant, times 1 negative 2 e to the minus 6t. 

Now you notice that is exactly the same solution I got before. The only difference is 
that I have renamed the arbitrary constants. The relationship between them, c1 / 2, 
I am now ca lling c1 tilda, and c2 I am calling c2 tilda. If you have an arb itrary 
constant,  it doesn't matter whether you divide it by two. It  is still just an arb itrary a 
constant. It covers a ll va lues, in other words. Well, I think you will agree that is a 
different procedure, yet it has only one coincidence. It is like elimination goes this 
way and comes to the answer. 

And this method goes a completely different route and comes to the answer, except 
it is not quite like that. They walk like this and then they come w ithin viewing 
distance of each other to check that both are using the same characteristic equation, 
and then they again go their separate ways and end up with the same answer. There 
is something special of these values. You cannot get away from those two va lues of 
lambda. Somehow they are really  intrinsically connected. Occurs the exponentia l 
coefficient, and they are intrinsically connected with the prob lem of the egg that we 
started with. Now what I would like to do is very quickly sketch how this method 
looks when I remove all the numbers from it. In some sense, it becomes a little 
clearer what is going on. And that will give me a chance to introduce the terminology 
that you need when you ta lk about it. 

Well, you have notes. Let me try to write it down in genera l. I will first write it out 
two-by-two. I am just going to sketch. The system looks like (x, y) equals, I will still 
put it up in colors. Except now, instead of using  twos and fives, I w ill use (a, b; c, d). 
The tria l solution w ill look how? The trial is going to be (a1, a2). That I don't have to 
change the name of. I am going to substitute in, and what the result of substitution 
is going to be lambda (a1, a2). 

I am going to skip a step and pretend that the e^(lamda t) have a lready been 
canceled out. Is equa l to (a, b; c, d) times (a1, a2). What does that correspond to? 
That corresponds to the system as I wrote it here. And then we wrote it out in terms 
of two equations. And what was the resulting thing that we ended up with? Well, you 

write it out, you move the lambda to the other side. And then the homogeneous 
system is we will look  in genera l how? Well, we could write it out. It is going to look 
like (a - lambda, b; c, d - lambda). That is just how it looks there and the general 
calculation is the same. Times (a1, a2) is equal to zero. 

This is solvable nontrivia lly. In other words,  it has a nontrivial solution if an only if 
the determinant of coefficients is zero. Let's now write that out, ca lculate out once 
and for a ll what that determinant is. I will write it out here. It is (a - lambda)(d -
lambda) - bc = 0. And let's calculate that out. 

It is lambda^2 - a lambda - d lambda + ad - bc, where have I seen that before? This 
equation is the genera l form using letters of what we ca lculated using the specific 
numbers before. Again, I will code it the same way w ith that color salmon. Now, 
most of the ca lculations will be for two-by-two systems. 

I advise you, in the strongest possib le terms, to remember this equation. You could 
write down this equation immediately for the matrix. You don't have to go through 
all this stuff. For God's sakes, don't say let the tria l solution be blah, b lah, blah. You 
don't want to do that. I don't want you to repeat the derivation of this every time 
you go through a particular prob lem. It is just like  in solving second order equations. 

You have a second order equation. You immediately write down its characteristic 
equation, then you  factor it, you  find its roots and you construct the solution. It 
takes a minute. The same thing, this takes a minute, too. What is the constant term? 
ad - bc, what is that? Matrix is (a, b; c, d). Ad minus bc is  its determinant. This is 
the determinant of that matrix. I didn't give the matrix a name, did I? 

I w ill now give the matrix a name A. What is this? Well, you are not supposed to 
know that until now. I w ill tell you. This is ca lled the trace of A. Put that down in your 
little books. The abbreviation is tr A, and the word is trace. The trace of a square 
matrix is the sum of the d elements down its ma in d iagona l. If it were a three-by-
three there would be three terms in whatever you are up to. Here it is a + b, the 
sum of the diagona l elements. You can immediately write down this characteristic 
equation. Let's g ive it a name. This is a characteristic equation of what? Of the 
matrix, now. Not of the system, of the matrix. 

You have a  two-by-two matrix. You could immediately write down its characteristic 
equation. Watch out for this sign, minus. That is a very common error to leave out 
the minus sign because that is the way the formula comes out. Its roots. If it is a 
quadratic equation it w ill have roots; lambda1, lambda2 for the moment let's assume 
are real and distinct. For the enrichment of your vocabulary, those are called the 
eigenvalues. 

They are something which belonged to  the matrix A. They are two secret numbers. 
You can ca lculate from  the coefficients a, b, and c, and d, but they are not  in the 
coefficients. You cannot look at a matrix and see what its eigenva lues are. You have 
to ca lculate something. But they are the most important numbers in the matrix. They 
are hidden, but they are the things that control how this system behaves. Those are 
called the eigenva lues. Now, there are various purists, there are a  fair number of 
them in the world who do not like this word because it begins German and ends 
English. 

Eigenvalues were first introduced by a German mathematician, you know, around 
the time matrices came into being in 1880 or so. A little while after eigenvalues 
came into being, too. And since a ll this happened in Germany they were named 
eigenvalues in German, which beg ins eigen and ends va lue. But people who do not 
like that call them the characteristic values. Unfortunately, it is two words and takes 
a lot more space to write out. 

An older generation even ca lls them something different, which you are not so likely 
to see nowadays, but you will in slightly older books. You can a lso ca ll them the 
proper values. Characteristic is not a translation of eigen, but proper is, but it means 
it in a funny sense which has almost disappeared nowadays. It means proper in the 
sense of belong  to. The only examp le I can think of is the word property. Property is 
something that belongs to you. That  is the use of the word proper. It is something 
that belongs to the matrix. The matrix has its proper va lues. It does not mean 
proper in the sense of fitting and proper or I hope you w ill behave properly when we 
go to Aunt Agatha's or something like that. 

But, as I say, by far the most popular thing, slowly the word eigenvalue  is pretty 
much taking over the literature. Just because it's just one word, that is a tremendous 
advantage. Okay. What now is still to be done? Well, there are those vectors to be 
found. So the very last step would be to solve the system to find the vectors a1 and 
a2. For each (lambda) i, find the associated vector. The vector, we w ill ca ll it (a lpha)i. 
That  is the a1 and a2. Of course it's going to be  indexed. You have to put another 
subscript on it because there are two of them. 

And a1 and a2 is stretched a little too  far. By solving the system, and the system will 
be the system which I will write this way, (a - lambda, b; c, d - lambda). It is just 
that system that was over there, but I w ill recopy it, (a1, a2) equa ls zero, zero. And 
these are called the eigenvectors. Each of these is called the eigenvector associated 
with or belonging to, aga in, in that sense of property. Eigenvector, let's say 
belonging to, I see that a little more frequently, belonging to lambda i. 

So we have the eigenvalues, the eigenvectors and, of course, the peop le who ca ll 
them characteristic va lues a lso ca ll these guys characteristic vectors. I don't think I 
have ever seen proper vectors, but that is because I am not old enough. I think that 
is what they used to be ca lled a long time ago, but not anymore. And then, finally, 
the general solution w ill be, by the superposition principle, (x, y) equa ls the arb itrary 
constant times the first eigenvector times the eigenvalue times the e to the 
corresponding eigenva lue. And then the same thing for the second one, (a1, a2), but 
now the second index w ill be 2 to indicate that it goes w ith the eigenva lue 
e^(lambda 2t). I have done that tw ice. 

And now in the remaining five minutes I will do it a third time because it is possible 
to write this  in still a more condensed  form. And the advantage of the more 
condensed form is A, it takes only that much space to write, and B, it applies to 
systems, not just the two-by-two systems, but to end-by-end systems. The method 
is exactly the same. Let's write it out as it would apply to end-by-end systems. 

The vector I started with is (x, y) and so on, but I will simply abbreviate this, as is 
done in 18.02, by x with an arrow over it. The matrix A I will abbreviate w ith A, as I 
did before with capita l A. And then the system looks like x prime is equal to -- x' is 
what? x' = Ax That is a ll there is to it. There is our green system. Now notice in this 
form I did not even tell you whether this a two-by-two matrix or an end-by-end. And 

in this condensed form it w ill look the same no matter how many equations you 
have. 

Your book dea ls from the beginning with end-by-end systems. That  is,  in my view, 
one of its weaknesses because I don't think most students start with two-by-two. 
Fortunately, the book double-talks. The theory is end-by-end, but a ll the examples 
are two-by-two. So just read the examp les. Read the notes  instead, which just do 
two-by-two to start out with. The trial solution is x equals what? An unknown vector 
alpha times e^(lambda t). Alpha is what we called a1 and a2 before. Plug this into 
there and cancel the e^(lambda t). What do you get? Well, this is lambda alpha 
e^(lambda t) = A a lpha e^(lambda t) 

These two cancel. And the system to be solved, A a lpha = lambda alpha. And now 
the question is how do you solve that system? Well, you can tell  if a book is written 
by a scoundrel or not by how they go -- A book, which is in my opinion completely 
scoundrel, simply says you subtract one from the other, and without further ado 
writes A minus lambda, and they tuck a  little I in there and write alpha equals zero. 
Why is the I put in there? Well,  this is what you would like to write. What  is wrong 
with this equation? 

This is not a valid matrix equation because that  is a square end-by-end matrix, a 
square two-by-two matrix if you  like. This is a scalar. You cannot subtract the sca lar 
from a matrix. It is not an operation. To subtract matrices they have to be the same 
size, the same shape. What is done is you make this a two-by-two matrix. This is a 
two-by-two matrix w ith  lambdas down the ma in diagonal and I elsewhere. 

And the justification is that lambda a lpha is the same thing as the lambda  I times 
alpha because I is an identity matrix. Now, in  fact, jump ing from here to here is not 
something that would occur to anybody. The way it should occur to you to do this  is 
you do this, you write that, you rea lize it doesn't work, and then you say to yourself 
I don't understand what these matrices are all about. I think I'd better write it all 
out. And then you would write it a ll out and you would write that equation on the 
left-hand board there. Oh, now I see what it should look like. I should subtract 
lambda from the ma in diagonal. That is the way it w ill come out. And then say, hey, 
the way to save lambda from the main diagonal  is put it in an  identity matrix. That 
will do it for me. In other words, there is a little detour that goes from here to here. 

And one of the ways I judge books is by how well they expla in the passage from this 
to that. If they don't exp lain it at all and just write it down, they have never talked to 
students. They have just written books. Where did we get finally here? The 
characteristic equation from  that, I had forgotten what color. That is in salmon. The 
characteristic equation, then, is going to be the thing which says that the 
determinant of that is zero. 

That  is the circumstances under which it is solvable. In genera l, this  is the way the 
characteristic equation looks. And its roots, once again, are the eigenvalues. And 
from then you ca lculate the corresponding eigenvectors. Okay. Go home and 
practice. In recitation you will practice on both two-by-two and three-by-three cases, 
and we will talk more next time.
