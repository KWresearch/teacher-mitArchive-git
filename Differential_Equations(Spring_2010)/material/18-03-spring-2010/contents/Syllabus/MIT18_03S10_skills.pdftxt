The  Ten  Essential  Skills


You   should  strive  for  personal  mastery  over  the  following  skills.  These  are  the  skills   that 
other  courses  at  MIT  will  expect  you   to  have  when  you  ﬁnish  18.03.  This   list  of  skills 
is  widely  dissminated  among  the   faculty  teaching  courses   listing  18.03  as   a   prerequisite.  
You   must  become  proﬁcient  at  them   to  prepare  yourself  for  those  courses. 

1.  Model  a   simple  system   to  obtain  a  ﬁrst   order   ODE.  Visualize  solutions   using   di­
rection  ﬁelds  and  isoclines,   and   approximate  them  using  Euler’s  method. 

2.  Solve  a  ﬁrst  order  linear  ODE  by  the   method  of  integrating  factors   or  variation  of 
parameter. 

3.  Calculate   with  complex  numbers   and   exponentials. 

4.  Solve  a  constant  coeﬃcient  second  order	 linear   initial  value   problem  with  driv­
ing  term  exponential  times  polynomial.  If  the  input  signal  is  sinusoidal,  compute 
amplitude  gain  and  phase  shift. 

5.  Compute  Fourier   coeﬃcients,  and  ﬁnd  periodic  solutions  of   linear   ODEs  by  means 
of  Fourier  series. 

6.  Utilize 	 Delta   functions  to   model  abrupt  phenomena,  compute  the  unit  impulse 
response,   and   express  the  system  response  to  a  general  signal  by  means   of   the 
convolution  integral.  

7.  Find  the  weight   function  or  unit  impulse  response  and  solve  constant  coeﬃcient 
linear  initial  value  problems  using  the  Laplace  transform  together  with  tables  of 
standard  values.   Relate  the  pole  diagram  of the  Laplace  transform  to  the  long­term 
behavior  of   a   function.  

8.  Calculate   eigenvalues,   eigenvectors,  and   matrix  exponentials,  and  use  them  to   solve 
ﬁrst  order  linear   systems.   Relate  ﬁrst   order   systems  with  higher­order  ODEs. 

9.  Recreate  the  phase  portrait  of   a  two­dimensional  linear  autonomous  system   from  
trace  and  determinant. 

10.	 Determine  the  qualitative  behavior   of  an  autonomous  nonlinear  two­dimensional 
system  by  means  of  an  analysis  of  behavior   near  critical  points.
