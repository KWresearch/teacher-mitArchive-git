Part  I  points:  4.  4,  5.  6 ,  6.  8,  7.  6. 

4.  (a)  [2]  x  falls;  y  rises  and  then  falls;  and  z  rises.  With  � = .1,  µ =  .2: 

(b) [4] Startium obeys  the natural decay equation,  ˙x = −�x, with  solution x = x(0)e−�t . 
To  relate  �  to  its  half-life,  solve  for  it  in  x(0)/2 =  x(0)e−�tS  to  ﬁnd  �  =  (ln 2)/tS . 
Similarly,  µ = (ln 2)/tM . 
Midium  decays  as  well,  but  in  each  small  time  interval  gets  half  the  decayed  Startium 
1 �x(t)�t.  Thus  y˙ =  −µy +  2
1 �x.  Endium  receives 
added:  so  y (t + �t)  � −µy (t)�t +  2
half  the  decayed  Startium  and  all  the  decayed  Midium:  z˙ =  1
2 �x + µy .  Adding  these 
three  equations  gives  x˙ + ˙y + ˙z = 0. 
(c)  [4]  Using  x(0)  =  1,  we  know  that  x  =  e−�t .  Thus  y˙ + µy  =  1

factor  is  given  by  eµt :  d  (eµt y ) =  1 �e(µ−�)t .  Integrating,  eµt y  =  1  �  e(µ−�)t  + c  or  y  =

We  could  solve  for  z  in  the  same  way,  but  it’s  easier  to  calculate  z  = 1 −  x −  y  =

(d)  [4]  From  the  diﬀerential  equation  for  y ,  we  know  that  a  critical  point  occurs  when 
µy  =  1 �e−�t .  Substitute  the  value  for  y :  µ 1  �  (e−�t  − e−µt ) =  1 �e−�t .  Some  algebra

(e)  [2]  Everything  gets  doubled. 
(f )  [4]  If x = et  then  q (t) = tx˙ + 2x = tet + 2et  = (t + 2)et .  The  associated  homogeneous 
equation  is  tx˙ + 2x  =  0,  which  is  separable:  dx/x  =  −2dt/t,  so  ln |x|  =  −2 ln |t| + c  = 
ln(t−2 ) + c  and  x = C/t2 .  So  the  general  solution  of  the  original  equation  is  et  + C/t2 .

6.  (a)  [2]  above. 
(b)  [3]  ea+bi  =  ea ebi  so  |ea+bi | =  |ea ||ebi | =  ea .  Since  | − 2| =  2,  a =  ln 2.  Arg(ea+bi ) =  b 
up  to  adding  multiples  of  2� .  Arg(−1)  =  � ,  so  b  is  any  odd  multiple  of  � .  Answer: 
ln 2 + b� i,  b = ±1, ±3, . . .. 
(c)  [3]  cos(4t)  =  Ree4it  =  Re((eit )4 )  =  Re((cos t + i sin t)4 ).  By  the  binomial  theorem, 
(a + bi)4  = a4 + 4a3 bi − 6a2 b2 − 4ab3 i + b4 , so we ﬁnd cos(4t) = cos4  t − 6 cos2  t sin2  t + sin4  t. 
(d)  [8]  (i)  w = 2� i.  The  tra jectory  is  the  unit  circle. 
(ii)  w = −1.  The  tra jectory  is  the  positive  real  axis. 
(iii)  w  =  −1 + 2� i.  The  tra jectory  is  a  spiral,  spiralling  in  towards  the  origin  in  a 
counterclockwise  direction  and  passing  though  1. 
(iv)  w = 0.  The  tra jectory  is  the  single  point  1.

and  Re(B ei(3t−�) ) = B cos(3t − �),  so  you  get  the  same  answer. 
1  =  3−2i .

(c)  [5]  If  x = Rez ,  the  real  part  of  ˙z + 3z = e2it  is  ˙x + 3x = cos(2t).  Now  zp  =  13  e = 
3−2i (cos(2t) + i sin(2t))  has  real  part  xp  =  1  (3 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t)).  The  general  solution
