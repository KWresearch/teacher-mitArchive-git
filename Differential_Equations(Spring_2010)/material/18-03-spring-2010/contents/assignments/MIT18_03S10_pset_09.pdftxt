18.03  Problem  Set  9


I encourage collaboration on homework in this course.  However, if you do your homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades  for 
homework  you  have  not  thought  through  will  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You 
must  turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate, 
you  must  write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students 
you  worked  with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no 
extensions  will  be  possible.

(a) The population of long-tailed weasels and meadow voles on Nantucket Island has been 
studied  by  biologists.  They  measure  the  populations  relative  to  a  baseline,  in  hundreds 
of animals.  So x(2) = 5 means that at t = 2 there are 500 more weasels than the baseline 
value,  and  y(2)  =  −5  means  that  at  t  =  2  there  are  500  fewer  voles  than  the  baseline 
value. 
Biologists  from MIT  have  established  the  following  relationship  between  x(t)  and  y(t): 
x˙ = (0.5)x + y ,  y˙ = −(2.25)x + (0.5)y 

So  the  natural  growth  rate  for  each  species  is  0.5,  and  cross  terms  show  that more  voles 
are  good  for  weasels  but more  weasels  are  very  bad  for  voles. 

Work out the population evolution predicted by this model.  (Linear  Phase  Portraits: 
Matrix  Entry may  be  useful  to  you  in  visualizing  this.)  What  are  the  eigenvalues?  For 
one eigenvalue, ﬁnd the exponential solution of u˙ = Au.  Then take the real and imaginary 
parts to produce two real solutions.  Suppose that at t = 0 there are 100 more weasels than 
baseline, and the vole population is the baseline value.  What is the solution to this initial 
value  problem?  Is  the  number  of  weasels  increasing  at  t  =  0?  How  about  the  number 
of  voles?  When  does  the  number  of  voles  next  equal  its  baseline  value  (if  ever)?  Please

(b)  Invoke  the  Mathlet  Linear  Phase  Portraits:  Matrix  Entry.  Play  with  the  tool 
for a while to get a feel of it.  Notice that the eigenvalues can be displayed on the complex 
plane.  Deselect  the  [Companion  Matrix]  option,  so  you  can  set  all  four  entries  in  the

matrix.  Select  the  [eigenvalues]  option,  so  the  eigenvalues  become  visible  by  means 
of  a  plot  of  their  location  in  the  complex  plane  and  also  a  read-out  of  their  values.

varies  from −4  to  4.  For  each  value  of  b,  the  applet  suggests  a  pair  of  eigenvalues;  verify 
what  it  claims.  For  each  value  of  b,  describe  the  collection  of  all  eigenvectors  for  each 
eigenvalue.  (This description will depend upon b.)  For each value of b, write down all the 
normal  mode  solutions  (i.e.  all  the  solutions  of  the  form  eλtv,  where  λ  is  a  number  and 
v  is  a  vector).  If  the  system  is  defective,  ﬁnd  a  complementary  solution.  Take  one  value 
of  b  for which  the  system  is  complete  and  sketch  the  phase  portrait.  Take  one  value  of  b 
for  which  the  system  is  defective  and  sketch  the  phase  portrait.

of  the  homogeneous  linear  equation  u˙ =  Au,  where  A  = 
, as  a  varies.  The 
focus  is  now  on  the  colorful  diagram  at  the  upper  left.  To  start  with,  set  the  matrix  to 
−4  −3 
1  −1 
.  Then  move  the  a  slider  up  to  a  =  4,  and  watch  (1)  the  movement 
of  the  mark  on  the  (Tr,Det)  plane;  (2)  the  movement  of  the  eigenvalues  in  the  complex 
plane;  and  (3)  the  variation  of  the  phase  portrait. 
(a)  Compute  the  trace  and  determinant  of  A.  (They  will  depend  upon  a,  of  course.) 
Find  an  equation  for  the  curve  (or  line)  traced  out  by  the mark  on  the  (Tr,Det)  plane. 
(b) You notice  that  the  curve  in  the  (Tr,Det) plane  enters  a number  of diﬀerent  regions. 
When  the  cursor  crosses  a  red  boundary,  the  tra jectories  and  the  eigenvalue  indicators 
turn  red.  Work  out  what  the  values  of  a  are  at  those  crossings.  (So  this  is:  where 
det A  =  0,  where  det A  =  (trA/2)2  (twice,  once  not  represented  on  the  Mathlet),  and 
where  trA = 0. 
(c)  There  are  nine  phase  portrait  types  represented  as  a  varies  (ﬁve  regions  and  four 
walls).  Draw  an  interval  from  −5  to  +4.  On  it,  mark  the  four  values  of  a  at  which  the 

A  = 

matrix  crosses  one  of  the  walls.  Indicate  the  type  of  phase  portrait  you  have  at  each 
of  the  marked  points  and  along  the  intervals  between  them.  That  is,  classify  the  phase 
portrait  into  one  of  the  following  types,  as  in  the  Supplementary Notes,  §25:  spiral  (sta­
ble/unstable,  clockwise/counterclockwise), node (stable/unstable);  saddle;  center (clock­
wise/counterclockwise);  star  (stable/unstable);  defective  node  (stable/unstable;  clock­
wise/counterclockwise);  degenerate  (comb  (stable/unstable),  constant,  parallel  lines). 
(The applet uses the alternative terms “source” and “sink”  for “unstable” and “stable.”) 
(d)  For  each  of  the  four  special  values,  and  for  your  choice  of  one  value  in  each  of  the 
ﬁve  regons,  make  a  sketch  of  the  phase  portrait.  Be  sure  to  include  and  mark  as  such 
any  eigenlines,  and  the  direction  of  time.
