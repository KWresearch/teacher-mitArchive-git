i sin(4t))  so  xp  =  Re(zp ) =  e3t ( 5  cos(4t) +  4  sin(4t)).  The  homogeneous  equation  has

(c) [4] I measure the ﬁrst six zeros to be 2.36, 4.76, 7.12, 9.48, 11.89, 14.19.  The successive 
diﬀerences  are  2.40, 2.36, 2.36, 2.41, 2.30,  with  an  average  of  2.366.  My  measured  pseu­

doperiod  is  twice  this,  4.73.  The  damped  circular  frequency  of  this  system  is ωd  =  2  so 
the  pseudoperiod  is  2π  =  4π � 4.7496.  Not  bad  agreement.

(e) [5] We need to select xh  so that xh (0) = −xp (0) = − 1  and  ˙xh (0) = −x˙ p (0) = − 1 .  It’s

14.  (a)  [8]  Since  the  input  signal  has  amplitude  1,  the  gain  is  the  amplitude  of  the 
system  response.  The  equation  is  x¨ +  1
2 x˙ + 4x =  4 cos(2t).  The  complex  replacement  is 
2 z˙ + 4z  = 4e2it .  Since  p(2i) =  (2i)2  +  1
z¨ +  1
2 (2i) + 4 =  i,  zp  = 4e2it/i,  so  xp  =  Re(zp ) = 
4 sin(2t):  the  gain  is  4.  Also  the  phase  lag  of  the  sine  behind  the  cosine  is  φ  =  π 
2 .  The 
time  lag  is  t0  =  φ  =  π  � 0.7854.

The  phase  lag  φ  is −Arg(H (ω)) = Arg(p(iω))  so  tan φ = 
4 − ω 2 . 
Re(p(iω)) 
15.  (a)  [6]  p(s) =  s +  1  and  p(−1)  =  0,  so  we  are  in  resonance.  p� (s)  =  1 so the 
ERF/Resonant  gives  xp  = te−t . 
(b)  [6]  We  can’t  apply  undetermined  coeﬃcients  directly  since  p(0) = 0.  Let  u =  x˙ ,  so 
u¨ − u = t2 + 1.  Try  u = at2 + bt + c,  so  u¨ = 2a  and  t2 + 1 = u¨ − u = −at2 − bt + (2a − c) 
implies  a = −1,  b = 0,  2a − c = 1  or  c = −3:  so  up  = −t2  − 3.  Then  xp  is  the  integral  of 
up :  xp  = − 3
1 t3 − 3t.  To  solve  the  homogeneous  equation,  factor  p(s) = s(s − 1)(s + 1)  so 
xh  = c1  + c2et  + c3e−t .  x = xp  + xh .
