18.03  Problem  Set  8:  Second  Half 


This  is  the  second  half  of  Problem  Set  8.  The  ﬁrst  half  was  distributed  on  April  16  and 
is available on  the web. 
 

I encourage collaboration on homework in this course.  However, if you do your homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades  for 
homework  you  have  not  thought  through  will  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You 
must  turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate, 
you  must  write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students 
you  worked  with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no 
extensions  will  be  possible.

32.  (M  26  Apr)  [Linear  systems  and  matrices]  (a)  We’ll  work  with  the  two  homoge­
5 x = 0.  For each, 
neous constant coeﬃcient  linear equations x¨ + 4 ˙x + 3x = 0 and x¨ +  ˙x + 2
ﬁnd  two  linearly  independent  real  solutions  (Please  use  either  exponentials  or  functions 
of  the  form  ert cos(ω t)  or  ert  sin(ω t),  and  denote  them  by  x1 (t)  and  x2 (t).),  write  down 
the  general  real  solution,  and  determine  the  damping  type.  Also  compute  ˙x1  and  ˙x2 . 
(b)  Now  write  down  the  companion matrix  for  each  of  these  two  equations. 
(c)  Open  the  Mathlet  Linear  Phase  Portraits:  Matrix  Entry.  Select  “Companion 
Matrix,”  and  set  the  c  and  d  values  to  the  entries  of  the  companion  matrix  for  the  ﬁrst 

where  x(t)  is  a  solution  of 

Since  y  =  x˙ ,  a  solution  to  u˙ =  Au  is  given  by

equation.  (Note  that  clicking  on  a  hashmark  on  a  slider  sets  the  value.  In  some  cases 
you  will  have  to  accept  the  nearest  possible  value  to  the  desired  value.)

For  a  companion  matrix  A = 
,  the  colorful  window  at  the  upper  left  shows 
c 
d 
(d, −c).  You  can  adjust  them  by  a  cursor movement  over  that  plane. 
The  big  window  shows  the  “phase  plane”  of  the  system.  It  displays  the  tra jectories  of 
a  few  solutions.  Click  on  the  window  to  produce  more.  You  can  clear  them  all  using 
� 
� 
[Clear],  and  return  to  the  original  set  of  tra jectories  by  re-setting  one  of  the  c  or  d 
sliders.  Do  this;  return  to  the  originally  displayed  selection  of  tra jectories. 
x(t)
x˙ (t) 
x¨ + 4 ˙x + 3x  =  0  (in  this  ﬁrst  case).  Draw  a  picture  of  the  phase  plane.  Each  of  these 
tra jectory  curves  should  have  an  arrow  on  it  indicating  the  direction  of  time:  please 
indicate  this on your picture.  Identify which of the tra jectories correspond to each of  the 
basic solutions you found in (a).  (These will be among the originally chosen tra jectories.) 
(d)  There  are  some  hook-shaped  tra jectories.  The  picture  doesn’t  show  a  scale;  but 
suppose  that  the  largest  displayed  value  of  x  is  x  =  2.  A  tra jectory  crosses  the  x  axis 
at  x =  1.  What  is  the  solution  having  this  as  its  tra jectory  assuming  that  this  crossing 
occurs  at  t  =  0?  Sketch  the  graph  of  the  corresponding  solution  x(t)  of  the  original 
second  order  equation. 
(e)  Write  down  the  general  solution  having  the  same  tra jectory.  (Hint:  suppose  the 
solution  has  x(a) = 1). 
(f ) Now set the c and d sliders to the values relevant to the second equation you solved in 
(a).  Sketch  the  phase  portrait  (and  include  the  arrows  indicating  the  direction  of  time). 
Using  the  same  scale as above, what  is  the  solution which passes  through  (0, 1) at  t = 0? 
At  what  other  times  does  this  solution  cross  the  y  axis?  Sketch,  roughly,  the  graphs  of 
x(t)  and  of  y(t). 
(g)  In  these  companion  matrix  examples,  whenever  a  tra jectory  crosses  the  x  axis  it 
seems  to  do  it  perpendicularly:  its  tangent  vector  is  vertical.  Explain. 

(b)  Find  the  eigenvalues  and  eigenvectors  of  the  matrix  A  =

33.  (W  28 April) [Eigenvalues, eigenvectors] (a) Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
of  the  companion matrix  for x¨ + 4 ˙x + 3x = 0.  On  the x, y  plane draw  the  eigenlines.  For 
�

each  of  the  two  eigenlines,  write  down  a  solution  which  moves  along  it.  Compare  this 
with  the  work  you  did  in  32,  especially  in  part  (c).

.  Sketch  the 
eigenlines,  and  for  each  eigenline  write  down  all  the  solutions  whose  tra jectories  lie  on 
that  line. 
(c)  Now,  invoke  Linear  Phase  Portraits:  Matrix  Entry  again,  set  a,  b,  c,  and  d  to 
display the phase plane for this matrix, and sketch the phase plane that it displays.  Make 
sure  to  include  (by  clicking  on  the  phase  plane)  at  least  one  tra jectory  in  each  wedge 
between  eigenlines.  Include  arrows  indicating  the  direction  of  time.
