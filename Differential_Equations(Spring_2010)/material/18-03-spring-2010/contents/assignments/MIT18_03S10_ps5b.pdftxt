18.03  Problem  Set  5,  Second  Half 


The  ﬁrst  half  of  this  problem  set  was  handed  out  on  March  12  and  is  available  on  the 
web. 
 

I encourage collaboration on homework in this course.  However, if you do your homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades  for 
homework  you  have  not  thought  through  will  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You 
must  turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate, 
you  must  write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students 
you  worked  with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no 
extensions  will  be  possible.

Part  II.  20.  (F  19  Mar)  [Fourier  Series]  This  problem  will  use  the  Mathlet  Fourier 
Coefficients  at  http://math.mit.edu/mathlets.  When  the  applet  opens  you  are 
presented  with  a  series  of  sliders  labeled  bn .  By  pressing  the  [Formula]  radio  button 
you  can  see  that  they  are  coeﬃcients  of  sines  in  a Fourier  series made  up  entirely  of  sine 
functions.  If  you  press  the  [Cosine]  radio  button  you’ll  see  an ’s,  coeﬃcients  of  cosines. 
Move  one  of  the  slider  handles:  a  cosine  or  sine  curve  appears  and  changes  amplitude. 
Release it at some value and move another one.  The white curves shows the new sinusoid, 

and  the  yellow  curve  shows  the  sum  of  the  two.  By  moving  more  sliders  you  can  build 
up more  complicated  sums  and more  complicated  functions. 
Now  select  the  Target  [B].  Is  it  an  even  function  or  an  odd  function?  Based  on  this, 
decide  whether  to  appoximate  it  using  sines  or  cosines.  Select  one  or  the  other  appro­
priately  (using  [All  terms])  and  do  the  best  you  can  by  eyeballing  the  result  to  get 
the  best  approximation  you  can  to  the  green  target  curve.  Does  it  appear  that  only 
even  terms  are  needed?  Only  odd  term?  or  both?  The  [Odd  terms]  and  [Even  terms] 
buttons  allow  you  to  choose  just  the  even  terms  or  the  odd  terms,  and  gives  you more  of 
the  one  you  select.  If  it  seems  that  just  the  even  or  odd  terms will  be  useful,  explain  (in 
words)  why.  (Supplementary  Notes  §16.1 may  be  helpful  to  you  here.) 
(a) Write  down  these  values  of  the  coeﬃcients.

Fourier  coeﬃcients  for  this  function,  using  the  integral  formulas  for  them,  and  compare 
with  your  answers  from  (a).  Reset  the  sliders  to  the  computed  values  and  see  if  it  looks 
like  a  better  ﬁt. 
(c)  Now  set  the  sliders  to  some  random  set  of  values.  Still  with  target  function  [B] 
displayed,  select  the  [Distance]  button.  A  number  appears  at  the  upper  right  corner 
of  the  screen.  This  is  the  “root  mean  square”  distance  from  the  target  function  to  the 
selected  ﬁnite  Fourier  sum.  You  can  read  about  this  distance  in  Supplementary  Notes 
16.4,  but  perhaps  it  is  enough  to  know  that  it  is  a measure  of  goodness  of  ﬁt.  Instead  of 
eyeballing  the  ﬁt  as  before,  start  from  the  bottom  and  successively  adjust  the  sliders  to 
minimize  the  distance.  Write  down  the  optimal  values  of  the  coeﬃcients.  Compare with 
the  computed  values. 
Lessons:  (1)  The  Fourier  coeﬃcients  are  the  coeﬃcients  resulting  in  the  best  possible 
ﬁt,  and  (2)  the  process  of  optimizing  one  coeﬃcient  is  independent  of  the  process  of 
optimizing  any  of  the  others.  (This  is  “orthogonality.”)

function  of  period  2π  has  just  one  expression  as  a  linear  combination  of  cos(mt)’s  and 
sin(nt)’s.) 
The  square wave  sq(t)  is  the  odd  function  of  period  2π  such  that  sq(t) = 1  for  0 < t < π 
and  sq(π) = 0.  In  class  we  calculated  its  Fourier  series. 
(b)  sq(t)  has minimal  period  2π ,  but  it  is  also  a  function  of  period  4π .  Use  the  integral 
expressions  (EP  8.2  (6)–(8))  for  the  Fourier  coeﬃcients  to  calculate  its  Fourier  series, 
regarded  as  a  function  of  period  4π .  Comment  on  the  relationship  between  your  answer 
and  the  Fourier  series  for  sq(t). 
Use  the  Fourier  series  for  sq(t),  along  with  calculus  and  algebraic  manipulations,  to 
compute  the  Fourier  series  of  each  of  the  following  functions  without  evaluating  any  of 
the  integrals  for  the  Fourier  coeﬃcients.  In  each  case,  sketch  a  graph  of  the  function,  as 
well,  and  give  the minimal  period.
