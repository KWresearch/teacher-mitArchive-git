when  a =  1.  det A =  (trA)2/4  when  a2  + 2a − 11 = 0  or  a = −1 ± 2�3,  i.e.  a � −4.4641  and 
a = 2.4641.

(b)  [9]  s2 + 2s + 2 = (s + 1)2 + 1  so  the  roots  of  the  characteristic  polynomial  are −1 ± i.  Basic 
solutions  are  given  by  y1  =  e−t cos(t)  and  y2  =  e−t sin(t).  (I  write  y  instead  of  x  because  the 
problem  wrote  x  for  the  normalized  solutions.)  y 1 (0)  =  1,  y˙ 1 (0)  =  −1,  y2 (0)  =  0,  y˙ 2 (0)  =  1. 
So  x1  =  y1  + y2  and  x2  =  y2  form  a  normalized  pair  of  solutions:  x1 (t) =  e−t (cos t + sin t), 
x2 (t) = e−t sin t.
