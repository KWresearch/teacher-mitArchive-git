Part  I  points:  8.  8,  9.  12,  11.  9,  12.  7. 

8.  (a)  [3]  The  general  logistic  equation  with  small-population  growth  rate  k0  and  equi­
librium  population  p  is  y  =  k0 (1 − (y/p))y ,  The  top  menu  choice  is  y˙ = (1 − y )y − a, 
which  is  the  case  k0  =  1  and  p  =  1  together  with  a  hunt  rate  of  a.  The  only  added 
assumption  is  k0  = 1. 
(b)  [3]  0 = (1 − y )y − a  is  the  same  as  y 2  − y + a =  0,  which  by  the  quadratic  formula

there  is  one,  namely  y0  =  1
2 ,  and  it  is  semi-stable;  and when  a <  1
4  there  are  two,  the  top 
one  stable  and  the  bottom  one  unstable.

(c)  [3]  187.5  oryx  is  16  kilo-oryx,  and  a  =  16  leads  to  critical  points  2

So  the  stable  equilibrium  population  is  750  animals,  and  the  critical  population  below 
which  it  will  crash  is  250.

(e)  [2]  y 2  − y − a = 0. 

9.  (a) [3] y0  = 3/4, from (b) above:  y = u+ 3 , so 1−y =  1 −u and  ˙u = ( 1 −u)(u− 3 )−  3  =

2 u.  The  general  solution  to  this  is  u = ce−t/2 . 
(b)  [3]  The  linearized  equation  is  ˙u = − 1

(b)  [4]  x  =  c1e−t/2  + c2e−
5t/2 .  So  x˙ =  − 1
2 c1e−t/2  −  5
5t/2 ,  and  x0  =  c1  + c2 ,  x˙ 0  = 
2 c2e−
2 c1 − 5
4 (x0 + 2 ˙x0 ).  Then c1  = x0 − c2  =  1
2 c2 .  Thus x0 + 2 ˙x0  = −4c2  so c2  = − 1
4 (5x0 + 2 ˙x0 ).

(c) [3] x  is purely exponential when either c1  = 0—so 5x0 + 2 ˙x0  = 0—or when c2  = 0—so 
x0  + 2 ˙x0  = 0. 
(d)[4] Try  to  solve  for  t  in 0 = x(t) = c1e−t/2 + c2 e−
5t/2 .  This  leads  to c2/c1  = −e2t .  This 
admits  a  solution  for  some  t  exactly  when  c1  and  c2  are  of  opposite  sign.  To  get  positive 
t,  you  need  c2 /c1  < −1:  so  either  −c2  > c1  > 0  or  −c2  < c1  < 0.  In  terms  of  x0 , x˙ 0 ,  this 
says  either  x0 + 2 ˙x0  > 5x0 + 2 ˙x0  > 0,  or x0 + 2 ˙x0  < 5x0 + 2 ˙x0  < 0,  i.e.  either  x0  < 0  and 
5 x0 .  This  is  borne  out  by  the  applet.
