18.03  Problem  Set  5:  Part  II  Solutions


Part  I  points:  17.  4,  18.  0,  20.  4,  21.  4. 

17.  (a) [4] It  seems  that  C  must  be  close  to  50  µF.  The  values  of  V0  and  R  don’t  seem 
to  matter. 
(b)  [10]  Here  is  one  of  several  ways  to  do  this  problem.  We  are  looking  at  LI ¨ +  RI˙ + 
(1/C )I  =  V0ω cos(ω t).  To  undersand  its  sinusoidal  solution,  make  the  complex  replace­
ment  Lz¨ +  I z˙ + (1/C )z  =  V0ωeiωt ,  so  that  Ip  =  Rezp .  By  the  ERF,  the  exponential 
ωeiωt 
solution  is  zp  =  p(iω) .  To  be  in  phase  with  sin(ω t),  the  real  part  of  this  must  be  a 
positive  multiple  of  sin(ω t).  This  occurs  precisely  when  the  real  part  of  p(iω )  is  zero. 
Re p(iω ) = (1/C ) − Lω 2 ,  so  the  relation  is  1/C =  Lω 2  . 
To  check,  when  L  = 500  mH=  .5 H  and  ω  = 200  rad/sec,  the  system  response is in phase 
when  C  = 1/(.5 × (200)2) = 50 × 10−6  F  = 50  µF. 
(c)  [4]  It  seems  that  the  maximal  system  response  amplitude  Ir  occurs  when  ω  =  100 
rad/sec,  and  that it is  about 5  amps.  Then the  solution is in phase  with  the input  voltage.

(d)  [10]  In  (b)  we  saw  that  the  solution  is  the  real  part  of  zp  =  p(iω) .  The  ampli­

complex  number  moves  along  the  horizontal  straight  line  with  imaginary  part  R.  The 
point on  that line  with  minimal  magnitude is  Ri,  which  occurs  when  the  real part is  zero: 
C/ω  =  Lω ,  or  ωr  = 1/√LC .  The  amplitude  is  then  Ir  =  g (ωr )V0  =  V0/R.  It  depends 
only  on  V0  and  R,  not  on  L  or  C ! Finally, this is the  same  as the  condition for phase lag 
zero,  so  the  phase  lag  at  ω  =  ωr  is  zero. 
With  the  given  values  R  = 100  Ω,  L  = 1  H,  C  = 10−4  F,  ωr  = 100  rad/sec,  as  observed. 
When  V0  = 500  V  and  R  = 100  Ω,  Ir  = 5  Amps,  as  observed.

ωn 
Solutions  in  the  underdamped  case  have  the  form  x  =  Ae−ζ ωn t  cos(ωd t  − φ). 
[From 
lecture:  To  see  where  the  maxima  are,  notice  that  by  the  product  rule  for  deriva­

Thus  after  n  cycles  it  is  multiplied  by  a  factor  of  e−2πnζ /√1−ζ 2  so  1
