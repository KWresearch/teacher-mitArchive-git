18.03  Problem  Set  1


I  encourage  collaboration  on  homework  in  this  course.  However,  if  you  do  your  homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it  works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades  for 
homework  you  have  not  thought  through  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You  must 
turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate,  you  must 
write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students  you  worked 
with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no  ex­
tensions  will  be  possible. 
Part  I  of  each  problem  set  will  consist  of  problems  which  are  either  rather  routine  or  for 
which  solutions  are  available  in  the  back  of  the  book,  or  in  18.03  Notes  and  Exercises. 
Part  II contains more challenging and novel problems.  They will be graded with care  (Com­
plain  if  they  are  not!)  and  contribute  the  bulk  of  the  Homework  grade.  They  will  help  you 
develop  an  understanding  of  the material. 
Problems  in both parts are keyed  closely  to  the  lectures,  and numbered  to match  them.  Try 
the  problems  as  soon  as  you  can  after  the  indicated  lecture.  Most  problem  sets  correspond 
to  four  lectures,  through  the Monday  or Wednesday  before  the  set  is  due.  Each  problem  set 
is  graded  out  of  100  points.  Each  day  counts  24  points.  The  grader  has  4  points  to  give  or 
withhold  based  on  neatness  and  clarity  of  the  answers.  (Problem  sets  6  and  7  relate  to  only 
three  lectures,  and  each  day  in  them  counts  32  points.)

Part  II. 

0.  (T 2 Feb)  [Natural  growth,  separable  equations]  In  recitation  a  population  model  was 
studied  in which  the  natural  growth  rate  of  the  population  of  oryx was  a  constant  k > 0,  so 
that  for  small  time  intervals Δt  the population  change x(t + Δt) − x(t)  is well approximated 
by  kx(t)Δt.  (You  also  studied  the  eﬀect  of  hunting  them,  but  in  this  problem  we  will  leave 
that  aside.)  Measure  time  in  years  and  the  population  in  kilo-oryx  (ko). 
A  mysterious  virus  infects  the  oryxes  of  the  Tana  River  area  in  Kenya,  which  causes  the 
growth rate to decrease as time goes on according to the formula k(t) = k0/(a + t)2  for t ≥ 0, 
where  a  and  k0  are  certain  positive  constants. 
(a) What  are  the  units  of  the  constant  a  in  “a + t,”  and  of  the  constant  k0? 
(b) Write  down  the  diﬀerential  equation modeling  this  situation. 
� 
(c) Write  down  the  general  solution  to  your  diﬀerential  equation.  Don’t  restrict  yourself  to 
the values of  t and of x  that are  relevant  to  the oryx problem;  take care of all values of  these 
dx 
= ln |x| + c  correctly,  and 
variables.  Points  to be  careful about:  use absolute values  in 
x 
don’t  forget  about  any  “lost”  solutions. 
(d) Now suppose that at t = 0 there is a positive population x0  of oryx.  Does the progressive 
decline  in  growth  rate  cause  the  population  stabilize  for  large  time,  or  does  it  grow  without 
bound?  If  it  does  stabilize,  what  is  the  limiting  population  as  t → ∞? 

1.  (W 3 Feb)  [Direction  ﬁelds,  isoclines]  In  this  problem  you  will  study  solutions  of  the 
diﬀerential  equation 

= y  − x . 
2 

dy 
dx 
Solutions  of  this  equation  do  not  admit  expressions  in  terms  of  the  standard  functions  of 
calculus,  but  we  can  study  them  anyway  using  the  direction  ﬁeld. 
(a) Draw a large pair of axes and mark oﬀ units from −4 to +4 on both.  Sketch the direction 
ﬁeld given by our equation.  Do this by ﬁrst sketching the isoclines for slopes m = −1, m = 0, 
m = 1,  and m = 2.  On  this  same graph,  sketch,  as best you  can,  a couple of  solutions, using 
just  the  information  given  by  these  four  isoclines. 
Having done this, you will continue to investigate this equation using one of the Mathlets.  So 
invoke  http://math.mit.edu/mathlets/mathlets  in  a  web  browser  and  select  Isoclines 
from  the menu.  (To  run  the  applet  from  this window,  click  the  little  black  box with  a white 
triangle  inside.)  Play  around  with  this  applet  for  a  little  while.  The  Mathlets  have  many 
features  in  common,  and  once  you  get  used  to  one  it will  be  quicker  to  learn  how  to  operate 
the  next  one.  Clicking  on  “Help”  pops  up  a  window  with  a  brief  description  of  the  applet’s 
functionalities. 
Select  from  the  pull-down menu  our  diﬀerential  equation  y �  = y 2  − x.  Move  the m  slider  to 
m = −2  and  release  it;  the  m = −2  isocline  is  drawn.  Do  the  same  for  m =  0,  m =  1,  and 
m = 2.  Compare with  your  sketches.  Then depress  the mousekey  over  the  graphing window 
and  drag  it  around;  you  see  a  variety  of  solutions.  How  do  they  compare  with  what  you 
drew  earlier? 
(b)  A  separatrix  is  a  curve  such  that  above  it  solutions  behave  (as  x  increases)  in  one 
way,  while  below  it  solutions  behave  (as  x  increases)  in  quite  a  diﬀerent  way.  There  is  a 
separatrix for this equation such that solutions above  it grow without bound (as x  increases) 

while solutions below it eventually decrease (as x increases).  Use the applet to ﬁnd its graph, 
and  submit  a  sketch  of  your  result. 
(c)  Suppose  y(x)  is  a  solution  to  this  diﬀerential  equation  whose  graph  is  tangent  to  the 
m = −1  isocline:  it  touches  the  m = −1  isocline  at  a  point  (a, b),  and  the  two  curves  have 
the  same  slope  at  that  point.  Find  this  point  on  the  applet,  and  then  calculuate  the  values 
of  a  and  b. 
(d)  Now  suppose  that  y(x)  is  a  solution  to  the  equation  for  which  y(a)  < b,  where  (a, b) 
is  the  point  you  found  in  (c).  What  happens  to  it  as  x  → ∞?  More  speciﬁcally,  give  an 
explicit function f (x) whose graph is asymptotic to the graph of the function y(x).  For large 
x,  is  y(x) > f (x),  y(x) < f (x),  or  does  the  answer  depend  on  the  value  of  y(a)? 
The  following  observations  will  be  useful  in  justifying  your  claims.  Please  explain  as  clearly 
as  you  can  why  each  is  true. 
(i)  The  graph  of  y(x)  can’t  cross  the m = −1  isocline  at  a  point  (x, y)  with  x > a. 
(ii)  If  the  graph  of  y(x)  is  below  the m = 1  isocline  for  x = a,  it will  eventually  (as  x  grows) 
cross  the m = 1  isocline. 
(iii)  The  graph  of  y(x) must  eventually  cross  the  nullcline. 
(e)  Suppose  a  solution  y(x)  has  a  critical  point  at  (c, d)—that  is,  y � (c) = 0  and  y(c) =  d. 
What  can  you  say  about  the  relationship  between  c  and  d?  The  applet  can  be  very  helpful 
here,  but  verify  your  answer. 
(f )  It  appears  from  the  applet  that  all  critical  points  are  local maxima.  Is  that  true? 
2.  (F 5 Feb)  [Euler’s method]  (a) Write  y  for  the  solution  to  y �  = 2x with  y(0) = 0.  What 
is y(1)?  What is the Euler approximation for y(1), using 2 equal steps?  3 equal steps?  What 
about  n  steps,  where  n  can  now  be  any  natural  number?  (It  will  be  useful  to  know  that 
1 + 2 +  + (n − 1)  =  n(n − 1)/2.)  As  n → ∞,  these  approximations  should  converge  to 
· · · 
y(1).  Do  they? 
(b) In the text and in class it was claimed that for small h, Euler’s method for stepsize h has 
an error which  is at most proportional to h.  The n-step approximation  for y(1) has h = 1/n. 
What  is  the  exact  value  of  the  diﬀerence  between  y(1)  and  the n-step Euler  approximation? 
Does  this  conform  to  the  prediction? 

3.  (M 8 Feb)  [Linear models] Scrooge McDuck wants  to  set up a  trust  fund  for his nephew 
Don.  He  has  fool-proof  investments  which  make  a  constant  interest  rate  of  I ,  measured  in 
units  of  (years)−1  (so  I  = 0.05 means  5%  per  year),  and  he  proposes  to  dole  out  the money 
to  his  proﬂigate  nephew  at  a  constant  rate  q  dollars  per  year. 
(a)  Model  this  process  by  a  diﬀerential  equation.  (Use  the  symbols  I  and  q ,  rather  than 
speciﬁc  values  for  them.)  Explain  your  steps. 
(b)  Then  ﬁnd  the  general  solution  to  this  diﬀerential  equation. 
(c)  Now  take  I  = 0.05.  If  Uncle  Scrooge  wanted  to  fund  the  trust  so  as  to  provide  his 
nephew  with  $1000  per  month  in  perpetuity,  while  maintaining  a  constant  balance  in  the 
fund,  how much  should  he  invest? 
(d)  But  in  fact  Uncle  Scrooge  wants  to  teach  his  nephew  the  virtues  of  self-reliance,  and 
so  plans  on  having  the  trust  fund  run  entirely  out  of  money  in  exactly  twenty  years.  If  he 
wants  to  give  his  nephew  $1000  per month,  how much  should  he  fund  the  trust  with  at  the 
outset?  Give  the  answer  to  the  nearest  penny  (as  Scrooge  would  insist  on).
