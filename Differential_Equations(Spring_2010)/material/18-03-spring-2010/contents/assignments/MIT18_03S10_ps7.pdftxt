18.03  Problem  Set  7


I encourage collaboration on homework in this course.  However, if you do your homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades  for 
homework  you  have  not  thought  through  will  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You 
must  turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate, 
you  must  write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students 
you  worked  with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no 
extensions  will  be  possible.

Part  I. 
26.  (F  9  Apr)  Let  z  be  a  complex  number.  Find,  from  the  deﬁnition,  L[ez t ],  and  ﬁnd 
the  region  of  convergence  of  the  integral. 

27.  (M  12  Apr)  Notes  3A-9  (Do  (a)  using  the  s-shift  rule  as  suggested,  but  then  do 
it  again  by  writing  e−t  sin(3t)  as  a  linear  combination  of  complex  exponentials.);  Notes 
3B-1;  EP  4.3:  1,  5. 

28.  (W  14  Apr)  EP  4.3:  7,  8,  12,  13,  28,  36. 

Part  II. 

26.  (F  9  Apr)  [Laplace  transform]  (a)  Suppose  that  F (s)  is  the  Laplace  transform  of 
f (t),  and  let  a >  0.  Find  a  formula  for  the  Laplace  transform  of  g(t) =  f (at)  in  terms 
of  F (s),  by  using  the  integral  deﬁnition  and  making  a  change  of  variable.  Verify  your 
formula by using formulas and rules to compute both L[f (t)] and L[f (at)] with f (t) = tn .

(b) Use  your  18.02  skills:  Show  that  if h(t) = f (t) ∗ g(t)  then H (s) = F (s)G(s).  Do  this

as  a  double  integral;  and  changing  coordinates  using  x  =  t − τ ,  y  =  τ .  The  change  of 
variables  formula  (as  in  Lecture  18  (Week  8)  of  the  2007  version  of  18.02  on  OCW,  for 
example)  will  be  very  useful. 
(c)  Use  the  integral  deﬁnition  to  ﬁnd  the  Laplace  transform  of  the  function  f (t)  with 
f (t) = 1  for  0 < t <  1  and  f (t) = 0  for  t >  0.  What  is  the  region  of  convergence  of  the 
integral? 

27.  (M 12 Apr) [ODEs via Laplace transform] Let a and b be real numbers, with a = 0. 
(a)  Find  the  unit  impulse  response  and  unit  step  response  for  the  ﬁrst  order  operator 
aD + bI  by  translating  the  problem  to  the  frequency  domain  (i.e.  apply  the  Laplace 
transform),  solving  there,  and  translating  back  to  the  time  domain.  (This  will  be  much 
clearer  if you use  the  rule L[ ˙x] = sX (s) described  in  class and  the Supplementary Notes, 
in which  ˙x  is the generalized derivative of x(t), than  if you try to use the t-derivative rule 
as  described  in  EP.) 
(b)  Solve  ax˙ + bx = t  with  rest  initial  conditions  in  three  ways. 
(i)  Undetermined  coeﬃcients  to  get  xp ,  and  add  the  appropriate  transient. 
(ii)  Compute  w(t) ∗ t  (using  the  value  for  w(t)  you  found  in  (a)). 
(iii)  Apply  Laplace  transform,  solve,  and  transform  back. 

28.  (W  14  Apr)  [Second  order  ODEs  via  Laplace  transform]  Find  the  unit  impulse 
response  of  the  following  operators  by means  of  the  Laplace  transform. 
(a)  3D2  + 6D + 6I . 
(b) D4  + I .
