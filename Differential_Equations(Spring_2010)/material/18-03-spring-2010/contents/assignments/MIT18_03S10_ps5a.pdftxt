18.03  Problem  Set  5,  First  Half


The second half will be available by Monday, March 29. 

I encourage collaboration on homework in this course.  However, if you do your homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades  for 
homework  you  have  not  thought  through  will  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You 
must  turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate, 
you  must  write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students 
you  worked  with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no 
extensions  will  be  possible.

Part  II. 

17.  (F  12  Mar)  [Series  RLC  circuits;  amplitude  and  phase]  Open  the Mathlet  Series 
RLC  Circuit.  This  applet  is  used  also  in  8.02,  where  the  voltage  drops  are  important. 
We  will  focus  entirely  on  the  current  response,  so  it  will  be  clearer  if  the  check  boxes 
labelled  VR ,  VL ,  VC ,  are  left  unchecked.  But  click  twice  on  the  I  box,  to  make  a  green 
curve  appear  in  the  graphing window,  representing  the  current  through  any  point  in  the 
circuit  as  a  function  of  time. 

The  Mathlet  uses  the  International  System  of  Units,  SI,  formerly  known  as  the  mks 
(meter-kilogram-second)  system.  The  equation 

LI ¨ + RI˙ + (1/C )I  = V˙


is  correct  when:

the  resistance  R  is measured  in  ohms,  Ω,

the  inductance  L  is measured  in  H,  henries,

the  capacitance  C  is measured  in  farads,  F,

the  voltgage  V  is measured  in  volts,  also  denoted  V,

the  current  I  is measured  in  amperes,  A.

The  slider  displays  millihenries,  mH  (1  mH=  10−3  H)  and  microfarads,  µF  (1µF=  10−6 
F),  and milliseconds, ms  (1 ms  = 10−3  sec). 
The  Mathlet  studies  a  sinusoidal  input  signal  V (t) =  V0  sin(ω t).  Play  around  with  the 
various  sliders  and  watch  the  eﬀect  on  the  (blue)  voltage  curve  and  the  (green)  current 
curve. 
(a) By  experimenting,  identify a  few values of  the  system parameters R, L, C , V0 , ω ,  for 
which  the  current  and  the  voltage  are  perfectly  in  phase.  For  example,  if  L  =  500  mH 
and  ω = 200  radians/second,  what  values  of  R,  C ,  and  V0  put  I  in  phase  with  V ? 
(b) Now  calculate  the  relationship  between  the  system  parameters which  leads  to  I  and 
V  being  in  phase.  Do  your  experiments  align  with  your  calculations? 
(c)  Set  R  =  100 Ω,  L  =  1000  mH,  C  =  100 µF,  V0  =  500  V.  Vary  ω  and  watch  the 
action.  For  what  value  of  ω  is  the  amplitude  of  I (t)  maximal?  What  is  that  amplitude 
(in  amps)?  What  is  the  phase  lag  between  the  input  signal,  V0  sin(ω t),  and  the  system 
response,  I (t),  for  that  value  of  ω? 
(d)  Verify  the  three  observations  made  in  (c)  computationally.  You  should  be  able  to 
� 
do  this  for  general  values  of  R,  L,  C ,  V0 . 
18.  (M  15  Mar)  Short  problem  on  damping  ratio:  We  called  ωn  = 
k/m  the  natural 
frequency of the system modeled by the homogeneous equation mx¨ + bx˙ + kx = 0.  Critical 
damping occurs at b/m = 2ωn .  Write b/m as a multiple of critical damping:  b/m = 2ωnζ . 
The  system  is  overdamped  if  the  “damping  ratio”  ζ > 1,  underdamped  if  ζ < 1. 
Suppose  the  system  is  underdamped,  and  that  a  solution  is  observed  to  decrease  in 
amplitude  by  a  factor  of  two  (that  is,  the  exponential  factor  in  the  solution  decreases 
to  half  its  value  at  t  =  0)  after  n  cycles.  Calculate  ζ  in  terms  of  n  and  the  constant 
α  =  ln 2/2π  �  0.1103178.  If  n  =  10,  what  is  ζ ?  Compare  this  exact  value  to  the 
engineer’s  approximation  α/n. 

19.  (W  10  Mar) Hour  exam.
