18.03  Problem  Set  4


I encourage collaboration on homework in this course.  However, if you do your homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades  for 
homework  you  have  not  thought  through  will  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You 
must  turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate, 
you  must  write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students 
you  worked  with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no 
extensions  will  be  possible.

Part  II. 

13.  (W  3  Mar)  [Superposition;  exponential  response  formula]  Find  the  general  real 
solution  of: 
(a) x˙ + 2x = e3t cos(4t).  (You  could do  this using  an  integrating  factor,  but  it’s  easier  to 
write  the  equation  as  the  real  part  of  a  complex-valued  equation  with  exponential  right 
hand  side,  and  use  the  ERF.) 
(b)  x¨ +  ˙x + 2x = cos t.  (Express  the  sinusoidal  solution  of  this  equation  in  two ways:  as 
a cos t + b sin t,  and  as  A cos(t − φ).) 
Now  open  the  Mathlet  Forced  Damped  Vibrations.  As  in  Damped  Vibrations,  the 
initial  conditions  are  set  by  the  box  at  left.  There  is  now  a  forcing  term,  A cos(ω t),  and 
the  values  of  A  and  ω  are  adjustable  by  sliders,  as  are  the  values  of  the  mass,  damping 
constant,  and  spring  constant.  The  force  in  this  system  is  applied  directly  to  the  mass 
(rather  than  being mediated  by  the  spring  or  the  dashpot). 
Set m = 1.00,  b = 1.00,  and  k = 2.00. 
(c)  Start  by  setting  A  = 0.00,  so  you  are  looking  at  the  homogeneous  case.  Set  the 
initial  condition  to  x(0)  = 0 and  ˙x(0)  =  1,  select  the  Solution  curve  only,  and  measure 
the  pseudoperiod.  (Notice  that  a  slider  above  the  graphing  window  lets  you  adjust  the 
vertical  scale.)  How  well  does  your measurement  agree  with  what  you  found  in  (b)? 
(d)  Now  set  A  = 1.00  and  ω  = 1.00.  Select  the  green  Steady  State  curve.  Measure  its 
amplitude  and  the  value  at  t  =  0.  You  computed  this  solution  in  (b).  Compare  the 
computed  amplitude  and  value  at  t = 0  with  what  you measured.  Also  compute  ˙xp (0). 
(e)  Finally,  select  initial  condition  x(0)  = 0,  ˙x(0)  =  0:  so-called  rest  initial  conditions. 
(Clicking  on  a  hashmark  gives  the  exact  value.)  If  you  select  Steady  State,  Transient, 
and  Solution,  you  can  see  all  three:  x = xp  + xh .  Please  compute  xh . 

14.  (F 5 Mar) [Models and complex gain] This problem employs the Mathlet Amplitude 
and  Phase:  Second  Order  I,  which  illustrates  the  steady  state  sinusoidal  system  re­
sponse  of  a  spring/mass/dashpot  system  driven  through  the  spring,  as  discussed  in  Lec­
ture  13.  The  amplitude  of  the  input  signal  is  1,  so  the  amplitude  of  the  system  response 
is  the  gain.  Select  b = 0.5,  k = 4.00,  and  ω = 2.00.  Animate  the  system. 
(a)  Verify  the  displayed  values  of  time  lag  and  gain. 
(b) The  input  signal  in  this  system  is  the position y(t) = cos(ω t) of  the  top of  the  spring 
(the cyan box).  The system response is the position of the mass (the yellow box), and we 
are  looking  just  at  the  steady  state  solution  x(t).  Determine  the  complex  gain  for  this 
system.  From  it  determine  the  gain  of  the  system,  as  a  function  of  ω .  Finally  determine 
tan φ  where  φ  is  the  phase  lag. 

15.  (M  8 Mar)  [Operators,  resonance,  undetermined  coeﬃcients] Find  the  general  real 
solution  of: 
(a)  x˙ + x = e−t .  (Use  the  Resonant  ERF.)

16.  (W  10  Mar)  [Frequency  response]  This  problem  will  use  the  applet  Amplitude 
and  Phase:  Second  Order  I  again.  Set  k = 4.00,  b = 0.50,  as  in  II.14.  These  settings 
will  be  in  force  for  parts  (a)  through  (c). 
(a)  In  II.14  you  studied  the  response  of  this  system  when  ω = 2.00.  The  gain  is  pretty 
large  with  that  setting.  Let’s  investigate  the  gain  for  other  values  of  ω .  You  can  see 
a  graph  of  the  gain  as  a  function  of  the  input  circular  frequency  ω  by  invoking  [Bode 
Plots].  The  top  window  shows  the  gain  as  a  function  of  ω ,  and  the  bottom  window 
graphs −φ as a function of ω .  Move the ω slider and verify that these readings correspond 
to  the  graph  of  the  system  response  at  left.  You  can  see  a  readout  of  the  value  of  the 
gain  and  the  phase  lag  for  the  selected  value  of  ω  by  rolling  the  cursor  over  the  relevant 
window. 
From  your  experimentation  with  the  applet,  do  you  believe  that  the  gain  maximal  for 
ω = 2.00,  or  is  the  “practical  resonance”  peak  at  a  diﬀerent  value  of  ω? 
In  II.14(b) you wrote down a  formula  for  the gain as a  function of ω  (for  these values of 
k  and  b),  g(ω).  Now  ﬁnd  the  value  ω  = ωr  which  maximizes  g(ω).  (Hint:  it’ll  be  easier 
to minimize the square of the denominator.)  Is it at ω = 2?  Finally, what is the maximal 
gain? 
(b)  Experiment  to  ﬁnd  the  value  of  ω  giving  phase  lag  as  close  to  45◦  as  you  can.  In 
II.14(b)  you  also  gave  a  formula  for  tan φ.  Determine  the  positive  value  of  ω  for  which 
the  phase  lag  equals  45◦ .  Compare. 
(c)  Now  invoke  the  [Nyquist  Plot].  This  shows  the  tra jectory  of  the  complex  gain 
H (ω)  as  ω  runs  from  0  to ∞.  The  value  of  H (ω)  corresponding  to  the  selected  value  of 
ω  is  shown  as  a  yellow  diamond.  This  means  that  the  length  of  the  yellow  strut  equals 
the  gain,  and  the  size  of  the  green  arc  equals  the  phase  lag.  Again  grab  the  ω  slider  and 
move  it  slowly  from  0  to  4.  Please  submit  a  sketch  of  the Nyquist  plot  with  ω  such  that 
φ(ω)  is  as  close  to  π 
4  as  you  can  get  it. 
(d)  Finally,  set  ω  =  2  and  leave  k  = 4.00,  but  adjust  the  value  of  b  by  grabbing  the  b 
slider.  What  do  you  observe  about  the  position  of  the  yellow  strut  in  the  Nyquist  plot? 
Try  setting  k  to  a  diﬀerent  value,  and  adjust  ω  so  that  the  phase  lag  is  close  to  π 
2 .  Now 
vary  b  and  comment  on  what  happens  to  the  phase  lag.  Please  explain  this  observation 
as  follows.  Write  down  a  formula  for  the  complex  gain  H (ω)  for  general  values  of  b,  k , 
and  ω .  What  does  φ  =  π 
2  say  about  the  complex  gain?  Finally,  what  relationship  does 
this  imply  about  b,  k ,  and  ω?  Does  this  relationship  explain  your  observation?
