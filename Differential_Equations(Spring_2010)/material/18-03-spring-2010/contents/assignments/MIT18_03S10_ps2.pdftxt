18.03  Problem  Set  2


I encourage collaboration on homework in this course.  However, if you do your homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it  works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades 
for  homework  you  have  not  thought  through  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You 
must  turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate, 
you  must  write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students 
you  worked  with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no 
extensions  will  be  possible.

Part  II. 

4.  (W  13  Feb)  [Solutions  to  linear  equations]  Almost  all  the  radon  in  the  world  today 
was created within the past week or so by a chain of radioactive decays beginning mainly 
from  uranium,  which  has  been  part  of  the  earth  since  it  was  formed.  This  cascade  of 
decaying  elements  is  quite  common,  and  in  this  problem  we  study  a  “toy  model”  in 
which  the  numbers  work  out  decently.  This  is  about  Tatooine,  a  small  world  endowed 
with  unusual  elements. 
A  certain  isotope  of  Startium,  symbol  St,  decays  with  a  half-life  tS .  Strangely  enough, 
it  decays  with  equal  probability  into  a  certain  isotope  of  either Midium,  Mi,  or  into  the 
little known stable element Endium.  Midium is also radioactive, and decays with half-life 
tM  into  Endium.  All  the  St  was  in  the  star-stuﬀ  that  condensed  into  Tatooine,  and  all 
the Mi  and  En  arise  from  the  decay  route  described.  Also,  tM  = tS . 
Use  the  notation  x(t),  y(t),  and  z (t),  for  the  amount  of  St,  Mi,  and  En  on  Tatooine,  in 
units  so  that  x(0) = 1. 
(a)  Make  rough  sketches  of  graphs  of  x,  y ,  z ,  as  functions  of  t.  What  are  the  limiting 
values  as  t → ∞? 
(b) Write  down  the  diﬀerential  equations  controlling  x,  y ,  and  z .  Be  sure  to  express  the 
constants that occur in these equations correctly in terms of the relevant decay constants. 
Use the notation σ  (Greek  letter sigma)  for the decay constant  for St and µ (Greek  letter 
mu)  for  the  decay  constant  for  Mi.  Your  ﬁrst  step  is  to  relate  σ  to  tS  and  µ  to  tM . A 
check on your answers:  the sum x + y + z  is constant, and so we should have  ˙x + ˙y + ˙z = 0. 
(c)  Solve  these  equations,  successively,  for  x,  y ,  and  z . 
(d) At what  time  does  the  quantity  of Midium  peak?  (This will  depend  upon  σ  and  µ.) 
(e)  Suppose  that  instead  of  x(0) = 1,  we  had  x(0) =  2.  What  change  will  this  make  to 
x(t),  y(t),  and  z (t)? 
(f )  Unrelated  question:  Suppose  that  x(t) =  et  is  a  solution  to  the  diﬀerential  equation 
tx˙ + 2x = q(t).  What  is  q(t)?  What  is  the  general  solution? 

5.  (F  15  Feb)  [Complex numbers,  roots of unity]  (a) Make a  table with  three  columns. 
Each  row  will  contain  three  representations  of  a  complex  number  z :  the  “rectangular” 
expression  z = a + bi  (with  a  and  b  real);  the  “polar”  expression  |z |, Arg(z );  and  a  little 
picture of the complex plane with the complex number marked on it.  There are ﬁve rows, 
containing,  in  one  column  or  another,  the  following  complex  numbers: 
(i)  1 − i 
(ii)  z  such  that  |z | = 2  and  Arg(z ) = π/6 
(iii)  A  square  root  of  i  with  negative  imaginary  part 
√
(iv)  A  sixth  root  of  1  with  argument  θ  such  that  0 < θ < π/2 
2)−13 . 
(v)  ((1 + i)/
(b)  Find  the  complex  roots  of  the  following  equations:  z 4  + 4 = 0;  z 2  + 2z + 2 = 0. 

6.  (T  19  Feb)  [Complex exponentials, Sinusoids] (a) Add a  fourth column  to  table you 
made  in  5  (a)  by  giving  the  exponential  representation  z = Aeiθ  (with  A  and  θ  real). 
(b)  Find  all  complex  numbers  z = a + bi  such  that  ez  = −2. 
(c)  Find  an  expression  for  cos(4t)  in  terms  of  sums  of  powers  of  sin t  and  cos t  by  using 
(eit )4  = e4it  and  Euler’s  formula.

(d)  The  Mathlet  Complex  Exponential  will  probably  be  useful  in  understanding  the 
rest  of  this  problem.  Open  it  and  explore  its  functionalities.  The  Help  button  lists most 
of  them.  Notice  that  in  the  left window,  the  real  part  a  ranges  between −1  and  1, while 
the  imaginary  part  b  ranges  from  −8  to  8.  You  use  the  left-hand  window  to  pick  out  a 
complex number a + bi.  When you do, a portion of the  line through  it and zero  is drawn. 
This  line  is  parametrized  by  (a + bi)t.  At  the  same  time,  the  curve  parametrized  by  the 
complex-valued  function  e(a+bi)t  is  drawn  on  the  right  window. 
For  each  of  the  following  functions  f (t),  make  a  sketch  of  the  graph  (in  a  convenient 
range),  ﬁnd  a  value  of  w = a + bi  such  that  Re(ewt ) = f (t),  and  sketch  the  tra jectory  of 
the  complex  valued  function  ewt  (i.e.  its  set  of  values). 
(i)  f (t) = cos(2π t) 
(ii)  f (t) = e−t 
(iii)  f (t) = e−t cos(2π t).
