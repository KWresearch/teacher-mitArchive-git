18.03  Problem  Set  3:  First  Half


This  is  the  ﬁrst  two  problems  of  PS3.  The  rest  will  be  available  on  February  26. 
I encourage collaboration on homework in this course.  However, if you do your homework 
in  a  group,  be  sure  it works  to  your  advantage  rather  than  against  you.  Good  grades  for 
homework  you  have  not  thought  through  will  translate  to  poor  grades  on  exams.  You 
must  turn  in  your  own  writeups  of  all  problems,  and,  if  you  do  collaborate, 
you  must  write  on  the  front  of  your  solution  sheet  the  names  of  the  students 
you  worked  with. 
Because  the  solutions  will  be  available  immediately  after  the  problem  sets  are  due,  no 
extensions  will  be  possible.

Part  I. 

8.  (F  19  Feb) Notes:  1E-1. 

9.  (M  22  Feb)  Consider  the  diﬀerential  equation  x˙ + 2x = 1. 
(a)  Find  the  general  solution  (i)  by  separation;  (ii)  by  use  of  an  integrating  factor;  (iii) 
by  regarding  the  right  hand  side  as  e0t  and  using  the  method  of  optimism  (i.e.  look  for 
a  solution  of  the  form Ae0t )  to ﬁnd  a particular  solution,  and  then  adding  in  a  transient. 
(b) This equation is also autonomous.  Sketch its phase line and some solutions (including 
the  equilibrium  solution).  Is  the  equilibrium  stable,  unstable,  or  neither? 
(c) Use Euler’s method with  three  steps  to estimate  the value of  the  solution with  initial 
condition  x(0) = 0  at  t = 1. 

Part  II. 

8.  (F  19  Feb)  [Autonomous  Equations]  This  problem  will  use  the  Mathlet  Phase 
Lines.  Open  the  applet  and  understand  its  use  and  conventions.  Click  on  [Phase  Line] 
to  see  a  representation  of  the phase  line.  Note  the  color  coding:  a  green dot  represents  a 

stable  or  attracting  equilibrium;  red  represents  an unstable  or  repelling  equilibrium;  and 
blue  represents  a  “semi-stable”  equilibrium. 
The  Kenyan  government  has  a  game  preserve  that,  in  the  absence  of  hunting,  supports 
an  oryx  population  that  follows  the  logistic  equation  with  a  stable  population  of  one 
kilo-oryx  (one  thousand  animals).  Kenya  wishes  to  investigate  the  eﬀect  on  the  oryx 
population  of  various  rates  hunting,  a. 
(a)  This  situation  is  well  modeled  by  the  top  menu  item  in  Phase  Lines.  Explain  why 
this  is  a  good model.  The  rest  of  this  problem  will  use  this  equation. 
(b)  It  appears  that  there  is  a pair  of  equilibria  for  some  values  of  a,  only  one  for  at  least 
one  other  value  of  a,  and  none  for  still  other  values  of  a.  Calculate  which  values  of  a 
behave  in which way;  for each a ﬁnd the critical values of y , and in each case say whether 
the  critical  points  involved  are  stable,  unstable,  or  semi-stable. 
(c)  The  Kenyan  government  hopes  to  allow  187.5  oryx  to  be  killed  in  an  average  year. 
Determine  for  them  what  the  resulting  stable  population  will  be.  If  this  strategy  is 
adopted,  what  is  the  critical  oryx  population  below  which  the  population  will  crash  (if 
the  same  harvest  rate  continues  to  be  allowed)? 
(d) For this value of a, there are ﬁve diﬀerent behaviors possible for the oryx population. 
(Two solutions exhibit the “same behavior” if one is a time-translate of the other).  Sketch 
one solution of each of the ﬁve types.  Your sketch should make it clear what the behavior 
of  the  solution  is  as  t  gets  small  and  as  t  gets  large.  Match  each  one  up  with  a  portion 
of  the  phase  line. 
(e)  Invoke  the  Bifurcation  Diagram  for  this  autonomous  equation.  Move  a  along  its 
slider  to  see  the  variety  of  behaviors  of  the  phase  line  of  as  a  varies.  The  green  and  red 
curve in the newly displayed bifurcation plane represents the equilibrium points for those 
equations,  for  various  values  of  a.  Give  an  equation  for  that  curve. 
9.  (M  22 Feb)  [Linear  vs Nonlinear] Still working with the equation  ˙y = (1 − y)y − a 
with a =  3  ,  let y0  be the stable critical point.  Write u = y − y0  for the population excess 
16 
over  equilibrium  (so  u < 0  if  the  population  is  less  than  the  equilibrium  value). 
(a) Rewrite  the diﬀerential equation as a diﬀerential equation  for u.  Check  that  the new 
equation  is  again  autonomous  and  that  u = 0  is  a  critical  point  for  it. 
(b)  For  small  u  we  can  neglect  higher  powers  of  u  (such  as  u2 ).  This  process  is  “lin­
earization  near  equilibrium.”  What  is  the  linearized  equation  near  u =  0?  What  is  the 
general  solution  of  this  linear  autonomous  equation? 
(c)  At  least  in  this  case,  when  solutions  of  the  original  autonomous  equation  get  near 
equilibrium,  they  are well modeled by  solutions  of  the  linearization.  Give  an  approxima­
tion  of  y  near  equilibrium.  Use  it  to  answer  this  question:  if  y(10) − y0  =  b,  estimate 
y(11)  and  y(12). 
(d) Suppose  that  the  linear  equation  ˙x + p(t)x = q(t)  is  autonomous.  What  can  you  say 
about  p(t)  and  q(t)? 

Part  I  solutions.  9(a)(iii)  e0t  =  1  so  we  are  seeking  a  constant  solution  x  =  A: 
x˙ + 2x = 2A  so  A =  1 .2 
9(c)  13 .27
