Each homework assignment has two parts:
Part I of each problem set consists of problems which are either rather routine
or for which solutions are available in the back of the book, or in 18.03 Notes
and Exercises by Prof. Mattuck.
Part II contains more challenging and novel problems. They will help you
develop an understanding of the material.
[EP] refers to a problem in the course textbook: [Amazon_logo] Edwards, C., and
D. Penney. Elementary Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems. 6th
ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003. ISBN: 9780136006138
[Notes] refers to an exercise in the "18.03_Notes_and_Exercises" written by
Prof. Mattuck.
Most problem sets also contains one problem based around one the "Mathlets."
