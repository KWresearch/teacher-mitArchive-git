Part  II  solutions: 
29.  (a)  [8]  (1)  {1, i, −i}:  For  large  t,  these  functions  have  exponential  growth  rate 
et .  (This  means  that  for  any  a <  1  < c,  eat  <  |f (t)|  < ect  for  large  t.)  They  also 
show  a  small  oscillation  of  approximately  constant  amplitude  and  circular  frequency  1.

(2)  {−1 + 4i, −1 −  4i}:  For  large  t,  these  functions  show  exponential  decay  like  e−t , 
and  oscillate  with  circular  frequency  4.  Examples:  f (t) =  ae−t  sin(4t) (a  =  0)  with

F (s) =

(4)  No  poles:  For  large  t,  these  functions  decay  to  zero  faster  than  any  exponential. 
Examples:  f (t) = aω (t − b) (a = 0

(iii) [4] This is a throwback problem.  The complex gain is W (i� ) =

or  its  square  ( 5

(iv)  [6]  The  yellow  box  lies  in  the  plane  above  the  imaginary  axis.  The  base  is  the 
amplitude  response  curve.  The  green  box  lies  in  the  plane  above  the  real  axis.  Its  top 
lies  on  the  graph  of  W (s) ,  and  its  base  is  the  real  axis.  The  red  arrows  lie  above  the 
|

poles  of  W (s).  The  yellow  diamonds  are  located  at  (±i� , |W (i� )|),  and  represent  the 
chosen  value  of  the  input  circular  frequency  and  the  corresponding  gain. 
32.  (a) [8] p(s) = s2 + 4s+ 3 = (s+ 2)2 − 1 has roots r1  = −1 and r2  = −3.  Basic solutions 
are given  by x1  = e−t  and x2  = e−3t .  (The  order  is not determined,  and  in  fact any  other 
pair  of  linearly  independent  solutions  count  as  “basic.”)  x˙ 1  = −e−t ,  x˙ 2  = −3e−3t .
