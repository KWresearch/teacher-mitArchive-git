18.03  Problem  Set  1:  Part  II  Solutions


Part  I  points:  0.  9,  1.  6,  2.  4,  3.  4. 

0.  (T  5  Feb) (a) [4] The growth rate  k(t) has  units years−1  (so  that k(t)x(t)Δt  has  the 
same  units  as  x(t)).  The  variable  t  has  units  years,  so  the  a  added  to  it  must  have  the 
same  units,  and  k0  must  have  units  years  in  order  for  the  units  of  the  fraction  to  work 
out. 
(b) [3] x(t  + Δt) � x(t) + k(t)x(t)Δt,  so  ˙x  =  k0x/(a  +  t)2  . 
(c)  [4]  Separate:  dx/x  =  k0(a  +  t)−2dt. 
ln |x| +  c1  =  −k0 (a  +  t)−1  +  c2 . 
Integrate: 
Amalgamate  constants  and  exponentiate:	 x =  ece−k0 /(a+t) .  Eliminate  the  absolute

value:  x  =  C e−k0 /(a+t) ,  where  C  =  ±e .  Reintroduce  the  solution  we  lost  by  dividing  by 
c 
x  in  the  ﬁrst  step:  allow  C  =  0.  So  the  general  solution  is  x  =  C e−k0 /(a+t) .  (Note  that 
the  exponent  −k0/(a  +  t) is  dimensionless,  as  an  exponent  must  be.) 
(d) [4] When  t  gets  very  large,  the  exponent  gets  very  near  to  zero,  so  there  is  a  ﬁnite 
limiting  population:  x∞  =  C .  Thus  x(t) =  x∞ e−k0 /(a+t) .  Take  t  =  0  in  the  solution: 
−k0 /a
k0 /a
x0  =  x∞e
,  or  x∞  =  e
x0 . 

1.  (W  6  Feb) (a) [3] (The  picture  lacks  the m  = 1  isocline,  sorry.) 

(b)[3]  The  separatrix  is  the  elbow  curve  that  other  integral  curves  snuggle  up  to  to 
the  left  and  separate  from  as  things  move  to  the  right. 
[Here  are  some  facts  about 
solutions  to  this  diﬀerential  equation,  some  of  which  are  contained  in  later  parts  of  this 
problem: Every  solution has a  “starting  time”  (if I think  of  x  as  time)  before  which  it 
does  not  exist—every  integral  curve  is  asymptotic  to  a  vertical  straight  line  to  its  left. 
Every  solution  above  the  separatrix  has  an  “ending  time”  after  which  it  does  not  exist— 
it  is  asymptotic  to  a  diﬀerent  vertical  straight  line  to  its  right.  Every  solution  below 
the  separatrix  survives forever,  and becomes  asymptotic (from  above)  to the graph  of 
y  =  −√x.  These  are  also  exactly  the  solutions  with  a  critical  point—each  has  one  local 
maximum.  The  separatrix  itself  is  a  solution,  a  very  special  one:  it  is  the  only  solution 

which  lives  forever  but  has  no  maximum  and  is  not  asympotic  to  y  =  −√x.  Instead  it  is 
asymototic  to  y  =  √x.] 
(c) [3] The  point  of  tangency  occurs  where  the  tangent  line  to  the  m  =  −1  isocline  has 
slope  −1.  The  m  =  −1  isocline  is  the  locus  of  x  =  y 2  + 1.  Diﬀerentiate  implicitly (using 
the chain rule)  1  = 2yy �,  so  if  y �  =  −1  then  y  =  −1/2.  The  equation  then  gives  x  = 5/4, 
so (a, b) = (5/4, −1/2). 
(d)  [3]  f (x) =  −√x,  or  indeed  f (x) =  −√x  +  m  for  any  m.  The  rest  of  the  problem 
depends  on  using  f (x) =  −√x,  though,  as  noted  on  the  website.  For  large  x,  y (x)  > 
−√x,  but  if  m <  0  there  will  be  solutions  of  the  type  we  are  considering  such  that 
y (x) <  −√x  +  m  for  some  x >  a. 
(i)  Follow  the  solution  from  the  x  =  a  line.  Suppose  that  it  does  cross  the  m  =  −1 
isocline, and  suppose that the  ﬁrst crossing is at a point (x, y ).  Since  it  started  below 
the  m  =  −1  isocline,  it  must  be  crossing  it  from  below.  This  means  that  the  slope  of  the 
solution  must  be  greater  than  the  slope  of  the  isocline  at  the  crossing  point.  The  slope 
of  the isocline  at the  crossing point is greater than  −1,  so  the  slope  of  the  solution  at  the 
crossing point  must  be greater  than  −1  too.  But  when  a  solution  crosses  the  −1  isocline, 
it  must  cross  it  with  slope  exactly  −1.  So  it  can’t  cross  it  at  all. 
It  will  be  clearer  if  I  don’t  try  to  follow  (ii)  and  (iii)  (as  explained  on  the  website). 
(i)  shows  that  solutions  y (x)  such  that  y (a)  < b  are  trapped  below  the  −1  isocline. 
Now  I  want  to  say  that  if  a  solution  is  above  the  lower  branch  of  the  nullcline  at  some 
point (x, y (x)),  then  it  stays  above  the  nullcline  forever  more.  The  slope  of  the  nullcline 
is  negative;  the  ﬁrst  crossing  must  be  from  above;  so  at  the  crossing  the  slope  of  the 
solution  must  be  even  more  negative;  but  when  it  crosses  the  nullcline  it  must  have  slope 
zero. 

Finally  I  claim that if (a, y (a)) is  below  the  nullcline,  then  the  integral  curve  must  even­
tually  cross  the  nullcline.  Until  it  does,  it  is  in  the  region  where  the  direction  ﬁeld  has 
positive  slopes.  So  it  is  increasing.  But  the  lower  branch  of  the  nullcline  is  is  falling;  so 
the  two  curves  must  eventually  intersect. 

One  can  also  argue  that  if  the  solution  never  crosses  the  nullcline  then,  after  rising  at 
the  start  it  must  eventually  start  to  fall,  since  the  nullcline  does.  So  it  must  reach  a 
maximum  somewhere  in  between.  But  all  maxima  of  solutions  occur  along  the  nullcline. 
(e) [3]  Critical  points  of  solutions  of  y �  =  y 2 
x  occur  when  y �  =  0,  that  is,  along  the 
−
null-cline:  so if  there is one at (c, d) then  c  =  d2  . 

(f )  [3]  Yes.  Here  are  two  arguments:  All  solutions  are  increasing  for  small  values  of 
x.  From  what  we  can  see,  the  solutions  with  critical  points  are  the  ones  which  become 
asymototic  to  the  graph  of  y  =  −√x,  which decreases.  Also they  seem to have just  one 
critical point,  which  must therefore be  a  maximum.  More complete  argument: Compute 
(as  in (c)) y ��  = 2yy �  − 1.  So  at  a  critical point,  where  y �  = 0,  we  see  that  y ��  =  −1.  This 
means  maximum. 

2.  (F  8  Feb) [2] y  =  x2 ,  so  y (1) = 1.


Euler’s  method  with  stepsize  h  for  this  equation:  xk  =  kh,  yk+1  =  yk  + 2xk h.

· · · 
So  yn  = 2(1 + 2 +
for  y (1):  n(n  − 1)/n2  = (n  − 1)/n.  The  limit  of  this  as  n  → ∞ is  1,  which  is  good,  and 
the  error  is  1/n,  which  is  exactly  h. 

3.  (M  11   Feb) (a) [5] Pick  a  letter  to  denote  the  number  of  years  after  the  fund  is  set 
up—say  t.  Pick  a letter  to denote function  of  t  giving the  value  of  the fund  at  time  t—say 
x.  In  a  small  time  interval  from  t  to  t  + Δt,  the  fund  increases  in  value  by  I x(t)Δt,  but 
decreases  in  value  by  qΔt:  x(t + Δt) − x(t) � I x(t)Δt − qΔt.  Divide  by  Δt  and  take  the 
limit: 
˙x  =  I x − q . 
(b) [5] Separate:  dx/(I x − q) =  dt.  Integrate:  I −1  ln I x − q + c1  =  t + c2 .  Amalgamate

constants  and  multiply  by  I : 
Eliminate  the  absolute  value  and  reintroduce  the  lost  solution:  I x − q  = 
.  Solve  for 
x:  x  = (q/I ) + C eI t  (where  this C	 is  the  earlier  one  divided  by  I ). 

(c)  [5]  Constant  trust  value  means  x˙ =  0,  which  says  I x  =  q  or  x  =  q/I .  So  with 
q  =  12,000  dollars/year  and  I  = 0.05,  x  =  $240,000.  (If  Scrooge  socks  away more  than 
this,  then  the  trust fund  could pay  out the $1000/month  and  still grow.  But  this  wouldn’t 
be  Scrooge.) 

(d) [5] We want to  ﬁnd the constant  of integration which  makes  x(T ) = 0, where  T  = 20: 
0 =  x(T ) = (q/I ) +  C eI T ,  or  C  =  −(q/I )e−I T  .  Thus  x  = (q/I )(1 − e−I T eI t).  Now  we 
can  set  t  = 0  to  ﬁnd  the  required  initial  value  of  the  trust:  x(0) = (q/I )(1 − e−I T ).  With 
T  = 20  and  I  = 0.05,  1 − e−I T  = 1 − e−1  � 0.63212056.  Thus  the  initial funding  is  about 
63%  of  what  it  was  in  (c):  x(0) � ($240,000)(.63212056) � $151,708.93.
