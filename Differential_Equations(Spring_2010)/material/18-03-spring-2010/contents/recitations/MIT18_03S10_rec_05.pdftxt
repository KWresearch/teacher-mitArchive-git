Complex  numbers,  complex  exponentials


√

1.  Mark  z  = 1 + 
3i  on  the  complex  plane.  What  is  its  polar  coordinates? 
Then mark z n  for n = 1, 2, 3, 4.  What  is each  in the  form a + bi?  What  is each 
one  in  the  form  Aeiθ ?  Then mark  z for  n = 0, −1, −2, −3, −4.

2.  Find a complex number a+bi such that ea+bi  = 1+
3i.  In fact, ﬁnd all such 
complex numbers.  For deﬁniteness, ﬁx b to be positive but as small as possible. 
(This  is  probably  the  ﬁrst  one  you  thought  of.)  What  is  en(a+bi)  for  n  = 
1, 2, 3, 4?  (Hint:  en(a+bi)  = (ea+bi )n .)  How  about  for  n = 0, −1, −2, −3, −4? 
3.  Write each of the following functions f (t) in the form A cos(ω t − φ).  In each 
case, begin by drawing a right triangle with sides a and b.  (a) cos(2t) + sin(2t). 
(b)  cos(π t) − √

3 sin(π t).  (c)  Re 

4.  Find a solution of  ˙x + 2x = et  of the form wet .  Do the same for  ˙z + 2z = e2it . 
In  both  cases,  go  on  to  write  down  the  general  solution. 

5.  Find  a  solution  of  ˙x + 2x =  cos(2t)  by  replacing  it  with  a  complex  valued 
equation, solving that, and then extracting the real part.  Your work also gives 
you  a  solution  for  ˙x + 2x = sin(2t).
