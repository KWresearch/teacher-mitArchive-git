Linear  phase  portraits 

The matrices  I  want  you  to  study  all  have  the  form  A =

� 

� 
. 

a 
2 
−2  −1 

1.  Compute  the  trace,  determinant,  characteristic  polynomial,  and  eigenvalues,  in 
terms  of  a. 

2.  For  these  matrices,  express  the  determinant  as  a  function  of  the  trace.  Sketch 
the  (tr  A, det  A)  plane,  along  with  the  critical  parabola  det  A  =  (tr  A)2/4,  and 
plot  the  curve  representing  the  relationship  you  found  for  this  family  of  matrices. 
On  this  curve,  plot  the  points  corresponding  to  the  following  values  of  a:  a  = 
−6, −5, −2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

3.  Make  a  table  showing  for  each  a  in  this  list  (1)  the  eigenvalues;  (2)  information 
about  the  phase  portrait  derived  from  the  eigenvalues  (saddle,  node,  spiral)  and 
the  stability  type  (stable  if  all  real  parts  are  negative;  unstable  if  at  least  one  real 
part  is  positive;  undesignated  if  neither);  (3)  further  information  beyond  what  the 
eigenvalues  alone  tell you:  if  a  spiral,  the direction  (clockwise or  counterclockwise) of 
motion;  if  the  eigenvalues  are  repeated,  whether  the matrix  is  defective  or  complete. 
In each case, make a small sketch of the phase portrait which conveys this information, 
but  does  not  try  to  get  the  eigendirections  right. 

4.  Make  sure  you  know  how  to  ﬁnd  the  general  solution  to  u˙ = Au  for  each  of  these 
cases.  Special  attention  is  required  in  the  defective  node  case.
