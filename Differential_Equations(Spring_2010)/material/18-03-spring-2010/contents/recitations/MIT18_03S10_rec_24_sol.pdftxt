Matrix  exponentials 

2.  In  this  problem,  A = 

1.  On  the  trace-determinant  plane,  where  can  you  guarantee  that  any  matrix  with 
this  value  of  trace  and  determinant  is  stable?  Unstable?  Neutrally  stable?  Are  there 
there any values of  the  trace and determinant  for which  there are matrices  exhibiting 
more  than  one  type  of  limiting  behavior? 
Stable  solutions  occur  if  and  only  if  both  eigenvalues  have  negative  real  part.  This 
happens  exactly  when  the  trace  is  negative  and  the  determinant  is  positive. 
Unstable solutions occur when there  is at  least one eigenvalue with positive real part. 
This  happens  either  when  the  determinant  is  negative,  or  when  the  trace  is  positive. 
Neutrally  stable  solutions  occur  either  when  the  trace  is  zero  and  the  determinant  is 
positive  (giving  periodic  solutions),  or  when  the  determinant  is  zero  and  the  trace  is 
negative  (giving  combs). 
When the trace and determinant are both zero,  the zero matrix gives neutrally stable 
behavior,  while  the  matrix  that  has  exactly  one  nonzero  entry,  in  the  upper  right, 
� 
� 
gives  unstable  behavior.
