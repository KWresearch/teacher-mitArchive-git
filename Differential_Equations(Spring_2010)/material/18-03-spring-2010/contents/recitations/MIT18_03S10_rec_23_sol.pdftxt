Linear  phase  portraits 

The matrices  I  want  you  to  study  all  have  the  form  A =

1.  Compute  the  trace,  determinant,  characteristic  polynomial,  and  eigenvalues,  in 
terms  of  a. 
The trace is the sum of diagonals:  a− 1.  The determinant is −a+ 4.  the characteristic 
polynomial  is  (a − λ)(−1 − λ) + 4 = λ2  + (1 − a)λ + 4 − a.  The  eigenvalues  are  the 
roots  of  the  characteristic  polynomial,  or  a−1±√
2+2a−15 .

2.  For  these  matrices,  express  the  determinant  as  a  function  of  the  trace.  Sketch 
the  (tr  A, det  A)  plane,  along  with  the  critical  parabola  det  A  =  (tr  A)2/4,  and 
plot  the  curve  representing  the  relationship  you  found  for  this  family  of  matrices. 
On  this  curve,  plot  the  points  corresponding  to  the  following  values  of  a:  a  = 
−6, −5, −2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
det A = 3 − tr  A.  The points are:  (−7, 10), (−6, 9), (−3, 6), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), 
and  (4, −1).  The  line  intersects  the parabola  at  (−6, 9)  and  (2, 1),  i.e., where  a = −5 
and  a = 3,  respectively. 

3.  Make  a  table  showing  for  each  a  in  this  list  (1)  the  eigenvalues;  (2)  information 
about  the  phase  portrait  derived  from  the  eigenvalues  (saddle,  node,  spiral)  and 
the  stability  type  (stable  if  all  real  parts  are  negative;  unstable  if  at  least  one  real 
part  is  positive;  undesignated  if  neither);  (3)  further  information  beyond  what  the 
eigenvalues  alone  tell you:  if  a  spiral,  the direction  (clockwise or  counterclockwise) of 
motion;  if  the  eigenvalues  are  repeated,  whether  the matrix  is  defective  or  complete.

The  defective  nodes  are  defective,  because  A − λI  is  nonzero.

4.  Make  sure  you  know  how  to  ﬁnd  the  general  solution  to  u˙ = Au  for  each  of  these 
cases.  Special  attention  is  required  in  the  defective  node  case.
