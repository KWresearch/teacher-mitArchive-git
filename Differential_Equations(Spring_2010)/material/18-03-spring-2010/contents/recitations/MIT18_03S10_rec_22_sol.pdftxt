We  write  u(t) = 

(a) Write  down  the  matrix  of  coeﬃcients,  A,  so  that  we  are  solving  u˙ = Au.  What 
is  its  trace?  Its  determinant?  Its  characteristic  polynomial  pA (λ)  =  det(A − λI )?

Relate  the  trace  and  determinant  to  the  coeﬃcients  of  pA (λ).

(−5)(4) − (6)(−3) = −2,  and  its  characteristic  polynomial  is  (−λ − 5)(4 − λ) + 18 =

constant  term.

(c)  Draw  the  eigenlines  and  discuss  the  solutions  whose  tra jectories  live  on  each. 
Explain why  each  eigenline  is made  up  of  three  distinct  non-intersecting  tra jectories. 
Begin  to  construct  a phase portrait by  indicating  the direction  of  time  on portions  of 
the  eigenlines.  Pick  a  nonzero  point  on  an  eigenline  and write  down  all  the  solutions 
to  u˙ = Au  whose  tra jectories  pass  through  that  point. 
The eigenlines are the lines that contain the solutions that run through the origin with 
� 
�

constant direction.  The  lines have  the  form  cv  for  c ∈ R, v  an  eigenvector.  The  solu­
tions have the form ceλtv  for v an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ.  In our case, we have

two  lines:  y = −x and y = −2x, with  tra jectories u1 (t) = c1et

arise because eλt  is always positive, and changing t does not switch between the parts 
of  the  line  where  c  is  positive,  zero,  or  negative. 
For  each  eigenvalue,  the  tra jectory  with  positive  c  lies  in  the  fourth  quadrant,  the 
tra jectory  with  c = 0  lies  at  the  origin,  and  the  tra jectory  with  negative  c  lies  in  the

In  this  case,  A =
