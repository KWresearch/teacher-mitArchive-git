1.  We’ll  solve  the  system  of  equations 

(a) Write  down  the  matrix  of  coeﬃcients,  A,  so  that  we  are  solving  u˙ = Au.  What 
is  its  trace?  Its  determinant?  Its  characteristic  polynomial  pA (λ)  =  det(A − λI )? 
Relate  the  trace  and  determinant  to  the  coeﬃcients  of  pA (λ). 

(b)  Find  the  eigenvalues  and  then  for  each  eigenvalue  ﬁnd  a  nonzero  eigenvector. 

(c)  Draw  the  eigenlines  and  discuss  the  solutions  whose  tra jectories  live  on  each. 
Explain why  each  eigenline  is made  up  of 
distinct  non-intersecting  tra jectories.

Begin  to  construct  a phase portrait by  indicating  the direction  of  time  on portions  of 
the  eigenlines.  Pick  a  nonzero  point  on  an  eigenline  and write  down  all  the  solutions

combination of a vector from the ﬁrst eigenline and a vector from the second eigenline. 
Use this decomposition to express the solution, and sketch  its tra jectory.  What  is the 
general  solution  with  this  tra jectory?
