Do  not  open  this  booklet  till  told  to  do  so.  There  are  ﬁve  problems.  Use  your  test-

taking  skills—be  sure  you  get  to  all  the  problems.  Do  all  your  work  on  these  pages. 

No  calculators  or  notes  may  be  used.  The  point  value  (out  of  100)  of  each  problem 

is marked  in  the margin.  Solutions will  be  available  on  the web  after  4:00  today,  and

at  recitation.

There  is  a  page  of  formulas  at  the  back  of  the  exam.
