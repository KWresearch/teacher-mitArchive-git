Do  not  open  this  booklet  till  told  to  do  so.  There  are  ﬁve  problems.  Use  your  test-
taking  skills—be  sure  you  get  to  all  the  problems.  Do  all  your  work  on  these  pages. 
No  calculators  or  notes  may  be  used.  The  point  value  (out  of  100)  of  each  problem 
is marked  in  the margin.  Solutions will  be  available  on  the web  after  4:00  today,  and 
at  recitation. 

[8] 

1.  (a) For what value of k  is the system represented by  ¨x + ˙x + kx = 0 critically damped?


[4]	

(b)  For  k  greater  than  that  value,  is  the  system  overdamped  or  underdamped? 

[8]	

(c) Suppose a  solution of x¨ +  ˙x + kx = 0 vanishes at  t = 1,  and  then again  for  t = 2  (but 
not  in  between).  What  is  k? 

[10]  2.  (a)  Find  a  solution  of  x¨ + x = 5te2t . 

[10]	

(b) Suppose that y(t) is a solution of the same equation,  ¨x + x = 5te2t , such that y(0) = 1

and  ˙y(0) =  2.  (This  is  probably  not  the  solution  you  found  in  (a).)  Use  y(t)  and  other

functions  to  write  down  a  solution  x(t)  such  that  x(0) = 3 and  ˙x(0) = 5.


[10]	 3.  (a)  Consider  the  equation  x¨ + bx˙ + kx  =  cos(ω t).  We  will  vary  the  spring  constant 
but  keep  b  ﬁxed.  For  what  value  of  k  is  the  amplitude  of  the  sinusoidal  solution  of 
x¨ + bx˙ + kx =  cos(ω t)  maximal?  (Your  answer  will  be  a  function  of  ω  and  may  depend 
upon  b  as  well.) 

[10]  (b)  (Unrelated  to  the  above.)  Find  the  general  solution  of

= 0. 

4.  A  certain  system  has  input  signal  y  and  system  response  x  related  by  the  diﬀerential 
equation  x¨ +  ˙x + 6x = 6y .  It  is  sub jected  to  a  sinusoidal  input  signal. 

[10]  (a)  Calculate  the  complex  gain H (ω). 

[5] 

(b)  Compute  the  gain  at  ω = 2. 

[5] 

(c)  Compute  the  phase  lag  at  ω = 2. 

5.  Suppose  that  1
2 t sin(2t)  is  a  solution  to  a  certain  equation mx¨ + bx˙ + kx = 4 cos(2t). 
(a) Write  down  a  solution  to mx¨ + bx˙ + kx = 4 cos(2t − 1). 

[4] 

[4] 

(b) Write  down  a  solution  to mx¨ + bx˙ + kx = 8 cos(2t). 

[12]  (c)  Determine m,  b,  and  k .
