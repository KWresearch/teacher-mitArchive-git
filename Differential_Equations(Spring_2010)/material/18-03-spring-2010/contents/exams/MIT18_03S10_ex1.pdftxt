Do  not  open  this  booklet  till  told  to  do  so.  There  are  ﬁve  problems.  Use  your  test-
taking  skills—be  sure  you  get  to  all  the  problems.  Do  all  your  work  on  these  pages. 
No  calculators  or  notes  may  be  used.  The  point  value  (out  of  100)  of  each  problem 
is marked  in  the margin.  Solutions will  be  available  on  the web  after  4:00  today,  and 
at  recitation.

1.  (a)  In  a  perfect  environment,  the  population  of  Norway  rat  that  breeds  on  the  MIT 
campus  increases by a  factor of e � 2.718281828459045 . . .  each year.  Model  this natural 
growth  by  a  diﬀerential  equation. 
What  is  the  growth  rate  k? 

(b)  MIT  is  a  limited  environment,  with  a  maximal  sustainable  Norway  rat  population 
of R = 1000  rats.  Write  down  the  logistic  equation modeling  this.  (You may  use  “k”  for 
the  natural  growth  rate  here  if  you  failed  to  ﬁnd  it  in  (a).) 

[8]	

(c)  The  MIT  pest  control  service  intends  to  control  these  rats  by  killing  them  at  a 
constant  rate  of  a  rats  per  year.  If  it  wants  to  limit  the  rat  population  to  75%  of  the 
maximal  sustainable  population,  what  rate  a  it  should  aim  for  (in  rats  per  year)? 

2.  For  the  autonomous  equation  ˙x = x(x − 1)(x + 2),  please  sketch: 
(a)  the  phase  line,  identifying  the  critical  points  and  whether  they  are  stable,  unstable, 
or  neither. 
(b)  at  least  one  solution  of  each  basic  type  (so  that  every  solution  is  a  time-translate  of 
one  you  have  drawn)

Below  is a diagram of a direction ﬁeld of  the diﬀerential  equation  y �  = (1/4)(x − y 2 ).  On 
it  please  plot  and  label: 
(c)  the  nullcline 
(d)  at  least  two  quite  diﬀerent  solutions 
(e)  the  separatrix  (if  there  is  one) 
√
(f )  True  or  false:  If  y(x)  is  a  solution  with  a  minimum,  then  for  all  large  enough  x, 
y(x) < 
x.  (No  explanation  needed:  just  circle  one.)

[10]  3.  (a) Use Euler’s method with  stepsize h = 1/2  to  estimate  the  value  at x = 3/2  of  the 
solution  to  y �  = x + y  such  y(0) = 1. 

[10]  (b)  Find  the  solution  of  tx˙ + x = cos t  such  that  x(π) = 1.

4.  (a)  Find  real  a, b  such  that

3 + 2i 

= a + bi. 

[3] 

(b)  Find  real  r, θ  such  that  1 − i = reiθ . 

[3] 

(c)  Find  real  a, b  such  that  (1 − i)8  = a + bi. 

[3] 

(d)  Find  real  a, b  such  that  b > 0  and  a + bi  is  a  cube  root  of  −1. 

[3] 

(e)  Find  real  a, b  such  that  eln 2+iπ  = a + bi. 

[5] 

(f ) Write  f (t) = 2 cos(4t) − 2 sin(4t)  in  the  form  A cos(ω t − φ). 

[5] 

5.  (a)  Find  a  particular  solution  to  the  equation  ˙x + 3x = e2t . 

[5]	

(b)  Find  the  solution  to  the  same  equation  such  that  x(0) = 1. 

[5]	

(c) Write  down  a  linear  equation  with  exponential  right  hand  side  of  which 
x˙ + 3x = cos(2t)  is  the  real  part. 

[5]	

(d)  Find  a  particular  solution  to  the  equation  ˙x + 3x = cos(2t).
