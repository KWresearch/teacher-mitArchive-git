(a)  Find  the  equilibria  of  this  system. 
(b)  There  is  one  equilibrium  in  the  south-west  quadrant.  Find  the  Jacobian  at  this 
equilibrium. 
(c)  The  equilibrium  you  found  in  (b)  is  a  stable  spiral.  For  large  t,  the  solutions  which 
converge  to  this equilibrium  have x-coordinate which  are well-approximated  by  the  func­
tion Aeat  cos(� t − λ)  for  some  constants A,  λ, a,  and � .  Some  of  these  constants  depend 
upon  the  particular  solution,  and  some  are  common  to  all  solutions  of  this  type.  Find 
the  values  of  the  ones  which  are  common  to  all  such  solutions. 
(d)  Finally,  return  to  the  autonomous  equation  ˙x  = 2x − 3x2  + x3  that  you  studied  in 
problem  2.  Write  down  a  formula  approximating  the  solutions  converging  to  the  stable 
equilibrium  when  t  is  large. 

Operator  Formulas 
• Exponential Response Formula:  xp  = Aert /p(r) solves p(D)x = Aert  provided p(r) = 0. 
•  Resonant  Response  Formula:  If  p(r)  =  0  then  xp  =  Atert /p� (r)  solves  p(D)x  =  Aert 
provided  p� (r)  �= 0. 

Defective  matrix  formula 
If A  is  a  defective  2 × 2 matrix  with  eigenvalue  �1  and  nonzero  eigenvector  v1 ,  then  you 
can  solve  for w  in  (A − �1I )w = v1  and  u = e�1 t (tv1  + w)  is  a  solution  to  u˙ = Au.
