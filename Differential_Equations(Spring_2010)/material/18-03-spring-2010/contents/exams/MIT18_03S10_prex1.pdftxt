18.03  Practice  Hour  Exam  I (2010)


1.  A  certain  computer  chip  sheds  heat  at  a  rate  proportional  to  the  diﬀerence  between 
its  temperature  and  that  of  its  environment. 

(a)  Write  down  a  diﬀerential  equation  controlling  the  temperature  of  the  chip,  as  a 
function  of time  measured in  minutes,  if the  temperature in  the  environment is  a  constant 
20◦C.  Your  equation  will  have  a  constant  in  it  which  can’t  be  determined  from  the  data 
given  so  far. 

(b) What  is  the  general  solution  of  this  equation?  (This  will  still  involve  the  unknown 
constant). 

(c) It  is  observed  that  if  the  chip  is  powered  down  at  t  = 0  at  a  temperature  of  70◦C  in 
a  room  at  20◦C,  its  temperature  at  t  = 10  minutes  is  60◦C.  Use  this  new  information  to 
complete  the  determination  of  the  diﬀerential  equation. 

2.  Estimate  y (2.2)  where  y  is  the  solution  of  the  diﬀerential  equation  y �  =  y 2 
y (2) = 0, using Euler’s method  with  step  size 0.1. 
3.  This problem  concerns  the diﬀerential  equation  y �  =  y 2  − x2  . Part  of its direction  ﬁeld 
is  shown  below. 
(a) On  the  diagram,  sketch  and  label  the  isoclines  for  slope  m  =  −4,  m  = 0,  and  m  = 4. 
(b) On  the  diagram,  sketch  the  graph  of  the  solution  of  the  equation  with  y (2) = 0.

(c) Estimate  the  value  y (100) of  the  solution  with  y (2) =  0.  Is  your  estimate  too  large 
or  too  small? 
(d)  A  certain  solution  y  has  a  local  extremum  at  x  =  −1.  What  can  you  say  about 
y (−1)?  Is  the  extremum  a  maximum  or  a  minimum?  For  full  credit,  make  a  relevant 
calculation,  rather  than  merely  relying  on  the  picture. 

4.  (a) Find  the  general  solution  of  tx˙ + 2x  =  t2  . 

(b) Find  a sinusoidal  solution to the diﬀerential  equation  ˙x + 2x  =  cos(2t).  Express your 
answer  as  a  sum  of  sines  and  cosines.  You  may  use  any  method  to  ﬁnd  this  solution. 
5.  (a) Express  each  of  the  cube  roots  of  −8i  ﬁrst  in  the  form  Aeiθ  and  then  in  the  form 
a  +  bi. 
(b)–(e) relate  to  the  sinusoidal  function  f (t) =  − cos( π t) − sin( π t).

(b) Find  positive  real  numbers  A  and  φ  such  that  f (t) =  A cos( π t  − φ).

(c) What  is  the  period  P  of  this  sinusoidal  function?


(d) What  is  the  time  lag  t0  of  this  sinusoidal  function?


(e) Please  sketch  a  graph  of  this  function  below,  marking  on  the  diagram  A,  P ,  and  t0 .


6.  This  problem  concerns  the  autonomous  equation  ˙y  =  y 3  − y . 
(a)  Sketch  the  phase  line  for  this  equation.  Mark  on  it  all  critical  points.  Label  each 
critical  point  as  stable,  unstable,  or  neither. 
(b)  Sketch  some  solutions  for  this  equation,  enough  so  that  for  any  b  between  −2  and 
+2  you  show  a  solution  y  such  that  y (t) =  b  for  some  t. 

(c) Determine  where points  of inﬂection  occur in  solutions to this  equation.  (A function 
f (t) has  a point  of inﬂection  at (a, b) if  f (a) =  b  and  f �� (a) = 0.) 

Solutions 

1.   (a) Let  x(t) be  the  temperature  of the  chip in degrees C.  x˙ = (20 − x),  or  ˙x + kx  = 20.

(b) x  = 20 + C e−kt  .

(c) The  data  gives  70  =  x(0) = 20 + C ,  so  C  = 50  and 60  =  x(10) = 20 + 50e−10k ,  so

−10k  = ln(40) − ln(50)  or  k  = (ln(50) − ln(40))/10.

3.  (a) The  nullcline  is  the  pair  of  crossed 
lines  y  =  ±1.  The m  = 2 isocline is the  up­
per/lower  hyperbola;  the  m  =  −2  isocline 
is  the  left/right  hyperbola.

(c)  The  graphed  solution  is  trapped  by 
the  funnel  having  the  nullcline  as  its  lower 
fence  and  the  m  =  −2  isocline  as  the  up­
per  fence,  y (100) is very near to  −100,  but 
slightly  larger. 
(d) Extrema  occur  when  ˙y  = 0;  that  is,  along  the  nullcline.  y¨ = 2yy˙ − 2x,  which  is  −2x 
on  the  nullcline.  At  x  =  −1  this  is  positive,  so  we  have  a  minimum. 
d 
(t2 x) =  t3  .  Thus  t2x  =  t4/4 + c  so  x  =  t2/4 + c/t2  . 
4.   (a) Multiply  through  by  t: 
dt
˙z  + 2z  =  e2it   .  One  way  to  solve  this  is  to 
(b)  First  solve  the  complex-valued  equation 
1  =  2−2i  =  1−i  . The  real part 
try  zp  =  Ae2it  and  solving  for  A:  (2i + 2)A  = 1,  or  A  =

5.  (a)  −8i  = 8e3π i/2  so  its  cube  roots  all  have  modulus  equal  to  the  postive  number
