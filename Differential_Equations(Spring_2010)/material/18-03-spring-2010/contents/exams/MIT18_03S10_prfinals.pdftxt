Solutions  of  Spring  2008  Final  Exam


1.  (a)  The  isocline  for  slope  0  is  the  pair  of  straight  lines  y  =  ±x.  The  direction  ﬁeld  along 
these  lines  is  ﬂat.

The  isocline  for  slope  2  is  the  hyperbola  on  the  left  and  right  of  the  straight  lines.  The

direction  ﬁeld  along  this  hyperbola  has  slope  2.

The isocline for slope −2 is the hyperbola above and below the straight lines.  The direction 
ﬁeld  along  this  hyperbola  has  slope  −2. 
(b)  The  sketch  should  have  the  following  features: 
The  curve  passes  through  (−2, 0).  The  slope  at  (−2, 0)  is  (−2) 2  − (0)2  = 4. 
Going  backward  from  (−2, 0),  the  curve  goes  down  (dy/dx  >  0),  crosses  the  left  branch 
of  the hyperbola x2 − y2  = 2 with slope  2,  and gets  closer  and  closer  to  the  line  y = x but 
never  touches  it. 
Going forward from (−2, 0), the curve ﬁrst goes up, crosses the left branch of the hyperbola 
x2  − y2  =  2  with  slope  2,  and  becomes  ﬂat  when  it  intersects  with  y  =  −x.  Then  the 
curve  goes  down  and  stays  between  y  =  −x  and  the  upper  branch  of  the  hyperbola 
x2  − y2  = −2,  until  it  becomes  ﬂat  as  it  crosses  y  =  x.  Finally,  the  curve  goes  up  again 
and  stays  between  y = x and  the  right  branch of  the  hyperbola x 2 − y2  = 2  until  it  leaves 
the  box. 
(c)  f (100) � 100 
(d)  It  follows  from  the  picture  in  (b)  that  f (x)  reaches  a  local maximum  on  the  line  y = −x. 
Therefore  f (a) = −a. 
(e)  Since we  know  f (−2) = 0,  to  estimate  f (−1) with  two  steps,  the  step  size  is  0.5.  At  each 
step,  we  calculate 

xn  = xn−1  + 0.5,

The  estimate  of  f (−1)  is  y2  = 1.125. 
(a)  The  equation  is  ˙x = x(x − 1)(x − 2).  The  phase  line  has  three  equilibria  x = 0, 1, 2. 
For  x < 0,  the  arrow  points  down. 
For  0 < x < 1,  the  arrow  points  up. 
For  1 < x < 2,  the  arrow  points  down. 
For  x > 2,  the  arrow  points  up. 
(b)  The  horizontal  axis  is  t  and  the  vertical  axis  is  x.  There  are  three  constant  solutions 
x(t) � 0, 1, 2.  Their  graphs  are  horizontal.

Below  x = 0,  all  solutions  are  decreasing  and  they  tend  to  −≈.

Between  x = 0  and  x = 1,  all  solutions  are  increasing  and  they  approach  x = 1. 
Between  x = 1  and  x = 2,  all  solutions  are  decreasing  and  they  approach  x = 1. 
Above  x = 2,  all  solutions  are  increasing  and  they  tend  to  +≈. 
(c)  A  point  of  inﬂection  (a, x(a))  is  where  x¨ changes  sign.  In  particular,  x¨(a)  must  be  zero. 
Diﬀerentiating  the  given  equation  with  respect  to  t,  we  have 
x¨ = 2 ˙x − 6xx˙ + 3x 2 x˙ = x˙ (2 − 6x + 3x 2 ) 
If  x(t)  is  not  a  constant  solution,  ˙x(a) = 0  so  that  x(a)  must  satisfy

(d)  Typo  in  the  original  version:  The  material  being  added  into  the  reactor  should  be  Bo 
instead  of  Ct. 
Let  x(t)  be  the  number  of  moles  of  Bo  in  the  reactor  at  time  t.  The  rate  of  loading  is  2 
moles  per  year.  Hence  x(t)  satisﬁes  ˙x = −kx + 2,  where  k  is  the  decay  rate  of  Bo.  Since 
the  half  life  of  Bo  is  2  years,  e−k·2  = 1/2  so  that  k = (ln 2)/2.  Therefore  we  have

The  initial  condition  is  x(0) = 0.

(e)  The  general  solution  is	 x(t) =  t3  +  xh (t),  where  xh (t)  is  a  solution  of  the  associated 
homogeneous  equation.  Since  the  characteristic  polynomial  s 2 + 2s + 2  has  roots  −1 ± i, 
x(t) = t3  + xh (t) = t3  + c1 e −t cos t + c2 e −t sin t.

(a)  For  t < 0,  the  graph  is  ﬂat  on  t-axis. 
For  0 < t < 1,  the  graph  is  ﬂat  at  1  unit  above  t-axis. 
For  1 < t < 3,  the  graph  is  ﬂat  at  1  unit  below  t-axis. 
For  3 < t < 4,  the  graph  is  ﬂat  at  1  unit  above  t-axis. 
For  t > 4,  the  graph  is  ﬂat  on  t-axis. 
v(t) = [u(t) − u(t − 1)] − [u(t − 1) − u(t − 3)] + [u(t − 3) − u(t − 4)]

Now  q(t − π )  =  1  only  for  0  < t − π <  1,  or  t − 1  < π  < t,  and  it  is  zero  elsewhere. 
Therefore  the  upper  limit  b(t)  equals  t.  The  lower  limit  a(t)  is  t − 1  if  t − 1  >  0,  or  0  if 
t − 1 < 0.  In  other  words,  a(t) = (t − 1)u(t − 1).

of  u(t)  is  of  the  form

The  linearization  of  the  nonlinear  equation  at  x =  1  is  the  linear  equation  ˙u =  f � (1)u =

−u.  Its  solutions  are  u(t) = Ae−t .  This means  x(t) � 1 + Ae−t  near  x = 1.
