1.  (a) The characteristic polynomial  is p(s) = s2 + s + k =  s +  1
4  .  This has 
1 . 
a  repeated  root  when  k =  4
(b)  If  k  is  larger,  the  contents  of  the  square  root  become  negative  and  the  roots  become 
non-real:  so  underdamped.  (Note  that  this  does  not  require  the  solution  to  (a).) 
(c)  Vanishing  twice  implies  underdamped.  The  pseudoperiod  is  2  (since  a  damped  si­

2.  (a)  Variation  of  parameters:  x  =  ue2t .  x˙ = ( ˙u + 2u)e2t ,  x¨ =  ( ¨u + 4 ˙u + 4u)e2t ,  so 
x¨ + x = ( ¨u + 4 ˙u + 5u)e2t , and u must satisfy u¨ + 4 ˙u + 5u = 5t.  Undetermined coeﬃcients: 
u˙ p  =  a,  u¨p  =  0,  so  4a + 5(at +  b) = 5t,  a  =  1,  b  =  − 5

(b) The homogeneous equation has general solution a cos t+ b sin t, so the general solution 
of  x¨ + x  = 5te2t  is  x  =  y + a cos t + b sin t.  3 =  x(0)  =  y(0) + a  =  1 + a  so  a  =  2. 
5 = x˙ (0) = y˙ (0) + b = 2 + b  so  b = 3:  x = y + 2 cos(t) + 3 sin(t).

, so we ﬁnd what value of k minimizes  p(iω) .  p(iω) = 
The amplitude of Re(zp )  is 
|p(iω)| 
(k − ω 2 ) + biω ,  so  k  =  ω2  minimizes  the  absolute  value.  [This  is  interesting;  the  spring 
constant resulting in largest gain is the one resulting in a system whose natural frequency 
matches  the  driving  frequency,  independent  of  the  damping  constant.] 
(b)  p(s) =  s3  − s =  s(s − 1)(s + 1),  so  the  modes  are  e0t  =  1,  et ,  and  e−t .  The  general 
solution  is  ae−t  + b + cet . 
4.  (a)  By  time  invariance  and  linearity  we  can  suppose  the  input  signal  is  cos(ω t). 
The  complex  input  is	 ycx  =  eiωt ,  and  z¨ +  z˙ + 6z  = 6eiωt  has  exponential  solution

(c)  φ = −Arg(H )(ω) = Arg(1 + i) =  π .4 
5.  (a)  If we write  q(t) = 4 cos(2t),  the  new  input  signal  is  4 cos(2t − 1) = q(t −  1 ),  so  by

2 ))  solves  the  new  equation. 
(b)  By  linearity,  x = t sin(2t). 
(c)  The  form  of  the  solution  indicates  resonance:  so  ±2i  are  roots  of  the  characteristic 
polynomial,  which  must  thus  be  p(s) = m(s − 2i)(s + 2i) = m(s2  + 4).  Thus  b =  0  and 
k  = 4m.  By  the  Exponential  Response  Formula  with  resonance,  mz¨ + kz  = 4e2it  has

Thus m = 2,  b = 0,  k = 8.
