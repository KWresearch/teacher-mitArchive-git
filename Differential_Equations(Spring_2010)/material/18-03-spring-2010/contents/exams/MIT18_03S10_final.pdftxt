1.  (a) and  (b) concern  the  tritium  that is leaking from the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating 
Station into  the  aquifer in New Jersey  at  a  certain  rate,  which  we  will  assume is  one kilogram

common  to  all  such  solutions. 

Operator  Formulas 
•  Exponential  Response  Formula:  xp  =  Aert/p(r) solves  p(D)x  =  Aert  provided  p(r) 6= 0. 
•  Resonant  Response  Formula:  If  p(r)  =  0  then  xp  =  Atert/p′ (r)  solves  p(D)x  =  Aert 
provided  p ′ (r) 6= 0.
