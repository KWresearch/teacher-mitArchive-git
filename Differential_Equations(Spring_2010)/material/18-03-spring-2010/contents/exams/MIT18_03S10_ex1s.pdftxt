1.  (a)  x(t) =  number  of  rats  at  time  t;  t  measured  in  years.  x˙ =  kx.  So  x(t) =  x(0)ekt  .  ex(0) =  x(1) = 
x(0)ekt  implies  k  = 1.

(c)  x˙ = 1 − R
x  − a.  The  pest  control  people  hope  for  an  equilibrium  at  x  =  4
rium,  so  a  = (1 − 3 ) 3 R  =  3  R  = 375.

2.  (a)  The  phase  line  shows  unstable  critical  points  at  x  =  −2  and  x  =  1  and  a  stable  critical  point  at 
x  =  0.  The  arrows  of  time  are  directed  up  above  1  and  between  −2  and  0,  and  down  between  0  and  1 
and  below  −2. 
(b)  There  are  seven  basic  solution  types:  three  equilibria;  a  solution  rising  above  x  =  1,  a  solution 
falling  from  1  towards  0,  a  solution  rising  from  −2  towards  0,  and  a  solution  falling  away  from  −2. 

(f ) True.  After the solution crosses the nullcline, it is  “inside”  the parabola and its derivative is positive. 
If it  were to cross the  nullcline again it  would have to cross the  upper branch, from below.  But the slope 
of  the  nullcline  is  positive,  while  at  the  moment  of  crossing  the  slope  of  the  solution  would  have  to  be 
zero.  So  it  does  not  cross  again;  it  stays  below  the  upper  branch  of  the  nullcline,  which  has  equation 
y  =  √x.

(b)  The  equation  is  d  (tx)  =  cos t,  so  tx  =  sin t  +  c  and  x  =

(b)  r  =  |1 − i| =  √2.  θ  = Arg(1 − i) =  − 4 . 
π
(c)  |1  − i| =  √2  and  Arg(1  − i) =  4 ,  so  |(1 − i)8 | = (√2)8  =  16  and  Arg((1  − i)8 ) = 
π 
(1 − i)8  = 16:  a  = 16, b  = 0. 
(d) If (a+ bi)3  =  −1 then a+ bi 3  = (a+ bi)3 = 
= 1 so  a+ bi = 1,  and 3Arg(a+ bi) = Arg(−1)  =  π

(or  3π  or  5π)  so  Arg(a  +  bi) =  3  or  π  or

5.  (a)  Try  x  =  Ae2t ,  so  that  ˙x  =  A2e2t  and  e2t  =  A2e2t  + 3Ae2t  = 5Ae2t  so  A  =  1
