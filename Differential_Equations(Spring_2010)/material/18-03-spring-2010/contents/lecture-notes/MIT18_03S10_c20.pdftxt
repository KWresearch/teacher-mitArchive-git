[1]  Periodic functions: for example the heartbeat, or the sound of a  
violin, or innumerable electronic signals. I showed an example of somewhat 
simplified waveforms of a violin and a flute. 
 
A function  f(t)  is "periodic" if there is  L > 0  such that   
f(t+2L) = f(t)  for every  t .  2L  is a "period." 
 
So strictly speaking the examples given are not periodic, but rather they 
coincide with periodic functions for some period of time. Our methods will 
accept this approximation, and yield results which merely approxmimate 
real life behavior, as usual. 
 
The constant function is periodic of every period. Otherwise, all the  
periodic functions we'll encounter have a  minimal  period, which is often 
called THE period.  
 
Any "window" (interval) of length  2L  determines the function. You can  
choose the window as convenient. We'll often use the window  [-L,L] . 
(This is one reason why chose to write the period as  2L.) 
 
 
[2] Sine and cosines are basic periodic functions. For this reason a  
natural period to start with is  2L = 2\pi :  L = pi . 
 
We'll use the basic window  [-pi,pi] .   
 
Question: what other cosines have period  2pi ?  
 
1. cos (t), cos(t/2), cos(t/3), ... 
 
2. cos(pi t), cos(2 pi t), ... 
 
3. cos(t), cos(2t), cos(3t), ... 
 
 
Answer:  cos(nt)   for  n = 1, 2, 3, .... has minimal period  2pi/n . 
 
I sketched graphs of  cos(t) ,  cos(2t) ,  and  cos(3t) . 
 
Among the sines, we have  sin(t), sin(2t), .... 
 
These are "harmonics" of the "fundamental" sinusoids with  n = 1 . 
 
If  f(t)  and  g(t)  are periodic of period  2L  then so is  af(t) + bg(t) . 
 
So we can form linear combinations: 
 

 
f(t) = a0/2 + a1 cos(t) + a2 cos(2t) +... + b1 sin(t) + b2 sin(2t) +... (*) 
       \                                 /  \                          / 
         ------- cosine series ---------      ----- sine series ------ 
       
 
This is a "Fourier Series." The  an  and  bn  are the "Fourier  
Coefficients." 
 
We'll see why the odd choice of  a0/2 for the constant term shortly. 
 
 
Theorem.  Any reasonable [piecewise continuous] function of period  2pi   
has exactly one expression as a Fourier series. 
 
The *definition* of the Fourier coefficients of a function  f(t)  is this:  
they are the coefficients that make  (*)  true. 
 
 
I set up the Mathlet FourierCoefficients and showed multiples of  cos(2t) ,  
and then added multiples of  cos(t) - you can see the addition of functions. 
 
For example, the standard squarewave is periodic of period  2pi  and  
 
      Sq(t)  =   1  for    0 < t < pi 
             =  -1  for  -pi < t < 0 
             =   0  for    t = 0 , pi 
 
The applet actually shows  (pi/4) Sq(t) . I tried to approximate it  
using  cosines; but they are even and  Sq  is odd, so it doesn't look so good. 
Working with sines, it seems that the even ones are not useful - they break 
the symmetry round  pi/2  exhibited by  Sq(t) .  I got pretty good results 
with   b_1 = 1.00 ,  b_3 = .33 ,  b_5 = .20 . 
 
 
[3]  Parity. A function  f(t)  is "even"  if  f(-t) =  f(t) ,   
odd if  f(-t) = -f(t). 
 
Even + even is even, Odd + odd is odd; Even + Odd can be anything. 
 
Even x even is even.  5 times 7 is odd, so I ask: 
 
Q2. The product of two odd functions is 
1. Even 
2. Odd 
3. Could be either or neither 
 
Well, if  f(t)  and  g(t)  are odd then  
 
     f(-t)g(-t) = (-f(t))(-g(t)) = f(t)g(t) 
 
so the product is even, in contrast to products of odd numbers. 
Also even times odd is odd. 
 
Linear combinations of evens are even, of odds are odd.   
 
cos(nt)  is even,  sin(nt)  is odd. 

 
The only function which is both even and odd is the zero function. For  
f(t) = f(-t)  and  f(t) = -f(-t)  together imply that  f(t) = -f(t) . 
 
 
If a periodic function  f(t)  is even,  then  f(t) - (cosine series)  
is a linear combination of evens and hence even, but it's also   
(sine series)   and so odd, so it's zero, so: 
 
The Fourier series of an even function is a cosine series:   bn = 0 . 
 
The Fourier series of an  odd function is a  sine  series:   an = 0 
 
 
[The same argument shows that if a polynomial is even then it's a sum of 
even powers of  t ;  if it's odd then it's a sum of odd powers of  t . ] 
 
 
[4] Average. The average of a function of period  2pi  is  
 
Ave(f) = (1/2pi) integral_{-pi}^pi f(t) dt 
 
Ave(f(t)+g(t)) = Ave(f(t)) + Ave(g(t)) 
 
Ave(cos(nt)) = 0   for  n > 0  and  Ave(sin(nt)) = 0  ,   
 
so applying  Ave to  (*) : 
 
Ave(f(t)) = a0/2   or 
 
a0 = (1/pi) integral_{-pi}^pi f(t) dt. 
 
 
Other integral expressions:   This will use the trigonometric integrals [Slide] 
 
integral_{-pi}^pi cos(mt) sin(nt) dt = 0 
 
integral_{-pi}^pi cos(mt) cos(nt) dt = 2pi  if  m = n = 0 
                                     =  pi  if  m = n > 0 
                                     =  0   if  m  is not equal to  n 
 
integral_{-pi}^pi sin(mt) sin(nt) dt =  pi  if  m = n  
                                     =  0   if  m  is not equal to  n 
 
 
The first of these is easy, since the product is odd and the interval you  
are integrating over is symmetric.  The others require some trig identity  
which you can find in Edwards and Penney. 
 
Application:  Substitute  (*)  into   integral_{-pi}^pi f(t) cos(nt) dt    
(for  n > 0) 
 
Compute this integral term by term: 
 
integral_{-pi}^pi (a0/2) cos(nt) dt = 0   (since  n > 0) 
 
Then we have a bunch of cosines. The  m-th  one gives: 

 
integral_{-pi}^pi am cos(mt) cos(nt) dt = am pi  if  m = n 
                                        =    0   if  m  is not equal to  n 
 
And then a bunch of sines. The  m-th  of them gives: 
 
integral_{-pi}^pi am sin(mt) cos(nt) dt = 0 
 
Only one of all these terms is nonzero:  the cosine term with  m = n ,   
and since then  am = an ,  we discover 
 
integral_{-pi}^pi f(t) cos(nt) dt = am pi  ,   or 
 
an = (1/pi) integral_{-pi}^pi f(t) cos(nt) dt 
 
We did this calculation assuming  n > 0 , but since  cos(0t) = 1   
the formula is true for  n = 0  (by our comment about averages above). 
 
Exactly the same method shows: 
 
bn = (1/pi) integral_{-pi}^pi f(t) sin(nt) dt
