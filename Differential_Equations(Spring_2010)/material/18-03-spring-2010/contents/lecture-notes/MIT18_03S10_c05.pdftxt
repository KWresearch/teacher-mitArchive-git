Complex Numbers, roots of unity

Complex numbers provide a tool for expressing aspects of the real world. 
Anything with an amplitude and a phase is secretly a complex number, 
and it is worthwhile bringing that secret identity out in the open. 
 
 
[1] Complex Algebra 
 
We think of the real numbers as filling out a line. 
The complex numbers fill out a plane. The point up one unit 
from  0  is written  i  (but written  j  by many engineers). 
Addition and multiplication by real numbers is as 
vectors. The new thing is  i^2 = -1 .  The usual rules of algebra apply. 
For example FOIL: 
 
     (1 + i)(1 + 2i) = 1 + 2i + i - 2 = -1 + 3i. 
 
Every complex number can be written as  a + bi  with  a  and  b  real. 
 
a = Re(a+bi)  the real part 
b = Im(a+bi)  the imaginary part:  NB this is a real number. 
 
Maybe complex numbers seem obscure because you are used to imagining 
numbers by giving them units: 5 cars, or -3 degrees. Complex numbers do 
not accept units. Also, there is no ordering on complex numbers, no "<." 
 
 
Question 1.  Multiplication by  i  has the following effect 
on a complex number. 
 
1. It rotates the number around the origin by 90 degrees counterclockwise. 
 
2. It rotates the number around the origin by 90 degrees clockwise. 
 
3. It takes a number to the number pointing in the opposite direction 
with the same distance from the origin. 
 
4. It reflects the number across the imaginary axis. 
 
5. It reflects the number across the real axis. 
 
6. None of the above. 
 
Blank: Don't know. 
 
Compute:  i(a + bi) = -b + ai , 
which is rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise:   Ans: 1. 
 
 

[2] Complex conjugation 
 
Notice the formula 
 
     (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2 - (bi)^2 = a^2 + b^2             (*) 
 
(which is the square of the distance to the origin). 
 
This lets us divide by a complex number: For example 
 
     i/(1+2i) = (i/(1+2i)) ((1-2i)/(1-2i)) 
 
              = (i+2)/(1+4) = (2+i)/5 . 
 
(*) suggests that we give a special name to the quantity  a-bi : 
it is the "complex conjugate" of  a+bi  and is denoted by an overline: 
     ____ 
     a+bi = a-bi :  reflect across the real axis. 
                        ___   _   _      __   _ _      = 
Conjugation satisfies   w+z = w + z  ,   wz = w.z  ,   z = z 
 
Proofs:  w = a+bi , z = c+di . 
     _   _                                      ___ 
     w + z = (a-bi) + (c-di) = (a+c) - (b+d)i = w+z 
     _ _ 
     w.z = (a-bi)(c-di) = (ac-bd) - (ad+bc)i 
 
     w.z = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i 
 
which conjugates to the line above. 
 
                _ 
Question 2: If  z = -z , then 
 
1. z is purely imaginary 
 
2. z is real 
 
3. z lies on the unit circle 
 
4. z = 0 
 
5. None of the above 
 
Blank. Don't know 
 
 
Ans:  1. 
 
 
[3] Polar multiplication 
 
Being points in the plane, complex numbers have polar descriptions. 
The distance of  z  from zero is 
 
| z| = "absolute value" = "modulus" = "magnitude" of  z. 
                      _ 

The angle up from the positive real axis is 
 
Arg(z) = "argument" = "angle" of  z.  As usual, it's only well defined 
                                      up to adding multiples of  2 pi. 
 
For example  Arg(1) = 0 , Arg(i) = pi/2 ,  Arg(-1) = pi. 
          _ 
| z|^2 = z z     and  tan(Arg(z)) = b/a = Im(z)/Re(z) . 
 
 
- Magnitudes Multiply :  |wz| = |w||z| . 
 
proof: It's not pleasant to compute absolute values - they involve square 
roots - but it's easy to compute squares: 
             ____     __    _ _ 
| wz|^2 = (wz)(wz) = wzwz = wwzz = |w|^2|z|^2 = (|w||z|)^2 
 
It follows that  |wz| = |w||z|  since both sides are positive. 
 
For example, the product of complex numbers on the unit circle lies again 
on the unit circle. I drew a picture. 
 
 
- Angles Add:   Arg(wz) = Arg(w) + Arg(z) 
 
I'll check this in case  w  and  z  are both on the unit circle.  Then: 
 
(cos a + i sin a)(cos b + i sin b) = 
 
((cos a)(cos b) - (sin a)(sin b)) + i ((cos a)(sin b) + (sin a)(cos b)) 
 
= cos(a+b) + i sin(a+b) 
 
using the angle addition formulas for  cos  and  sin . 
 
In fact multiplication of complex numbers contains in it the angle 
addition formulas for  sin  and  cos , and if you understand complex 
numbers you'll never have to memorize those formulas again. 
 
This checks with our question about multiplication by  i  above. 
Here's another question about multiplication: 
 
 
Question 3.  (1+i)^4 = 
 
1.  - 1 
 
2.  4 
 
3.  - 4 
 
4.  - sqrt(2) 
 
5.  4 i 
 
6. None of the above 
 

Blank: Don't know 
 
            Modulus     Argument     a+bi 
 
(1+i)^0        1           0         1 
 
(1+i)^1     sqrt(2)      pi/4        1+i 
 
(1+i)^2        2         pi/2        2i 
 
(1+i)^3     2 sqrt(2)   3pi/4       -2+2i 
 
(1+i)^4        4          pio        -4 
 
 
These powers of  (1+i)  spiral away from the origin. 
 
 
The powers all lie on a spiral emanating from the origin.  Ans:  (3) . 
Thus  1 + i  is a fourth root of  -4.
