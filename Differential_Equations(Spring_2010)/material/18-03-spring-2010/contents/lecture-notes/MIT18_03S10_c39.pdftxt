[1] Let's say that an equilibrium is  
-- "stable" if all nearby trajectories stay near to it and converge to  
it as  t --> infinity 
-- "unstable" otherwise 
 
We classified linear phase portraits using the (Tr,Det) plane. 
In the (Tr,Det) plane, the stable region is the upper left quadrant. 
It is  bounded by the straight half-lines where either the eigenvalues 
are purely imaginary, or one is zero and the other is negative.  
 
 
[2] The method we sketched on Friday and Monday works well "generically,"  
i.e. almost all the time. It lets you predict what the phase portrait of 
an autonomous system looks like near equilibrium, most of the time, 
and whether the equilibrium is stable or not. 
 
The facts: (1) If the linearization is not on the borderline of the stable  
quadrant, it correctly predicts the stability of the equilibrium.  
 
(2) If the eigenvalues of the Jacobian have nonzero real parts - so  
(tr,det)  is neither on the horizontal axis nor on the tr = 0, det > 0 line -- 
then the phase portrait is a small deformation of the linear phase portrait.  
 
Example:  x' = -y - y^2, y' = x + y^2 .  
The linearization at  (0,0)  is  x' = y , y' = -x :  trace = 0 , det > 0,  
so you expect centers (which are not stable), but the fact is that you get  
stable spirals (seen on a pplane plot). Other examples might show  
stable spirals instead, or centers. You can't tell which you get from the  
linearization alone. [These spiral decay to zero more slowly than exponential, 
though.] 
 
Example:  x'  =  4xy ,  y'  =  x^2 - y^2 . 
The linearization at (0,0)  is now   x' = 0 , y' = 0 : 
 
     J(0,0)  =  [ 0 0 ; 0 0 ]  
 
Degenerate:  det = 0. In fact *both* eigenvalues are zero (and it is 
complete). What is the phase portrait of this linear system? It just says   
u' = 0  so every point is a constant solution. The eigenvalues are both zero, 
every vector is an eigenvector, every solution is constant, it is a  
degenerate system. 
 
On the other hand, a Matlab plot [Slide] of the phase portrait shows that 
it has six ray solutions, unlike any linear portrait. Weird. Second order 
effects dominate.  

 
 
[3]  In studying a nonlinear autonomous system, the most important thing, 
after equilibria, is the possibility of periodic solutions.  
 
For example, the "van der Pol" equation is  
 
      x" + a (x^2-1) x' + x  =  0 
 
for fixed  a .  When  a = 0  this is just the harmonic oscillator, with  
omega_n = 1 ; all the nonzero solutions are periodic of period  2 pi. 
 
The companion system is  
 
      x'  =  y 
      y'  =  - x - a (x^2-1) y 
 
This system turns out to continue to have periodic solutions. When  a > 0  
the situation is in fact even better: there is ONLY ONE periodic  
trajectory, and all other nonzero solutions converge to it. This is a  
"limit cycle."  The human heart is in fact controlled by an equation like  
this. This is why it dependably returns to a normal periodic pattern after  
being disturbed.  
 
The limit cycle is an "attractor," in the sense that every nearby  
trajectory stays nearby and converges to it. I demonstrated the Mathlet 
"Vector Fields."  
 
 
[4]  Limit cycles are typical for 2D systems. 
But when you move to 3D things are much more complicated. The first such 
system was discovered right here at MIT by Edward Lorenz [Slide],  
who was modeling "convection rolls" in the upper atmosphere. In 1963  
he wrote down a fairly simple model, a nonlinear autonomous system  
in 3 dimensions: 
 
      x'  =  -ax + by 
      y'  =  -xz + rx - y 
      z'  =  xy - bz 
 
for constants  a , b , r.  Here's what happens for certain values of  
these parameters - and I showed the IDE tool  
"Lorenz Equations, Phase Plane, 0 < r < 30 .  
<http://www.aw-bc.com/ide/idefiles/media/JavaTools/lrnzr320.html>. 
 
The solutions don't ever settle down to a periodic orbit; but neither do 
they run off  to infinity. They just wrap pretty crazily around the two 
nonzero unstable equilibria which exist provided that  r > a/b .  
 
Now the "attractor" is much stranger than just a loop, and, strangely, 
is called a "strange attractor." This is the fundamental characteristic 
of "chaos."  
 
 
[5] In addition to these skills [Slide]  there are a couple of big ideas: 
Linearity is one. The exponential function is another.
