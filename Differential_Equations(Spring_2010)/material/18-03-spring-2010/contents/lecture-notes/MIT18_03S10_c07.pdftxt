[1]  Sinusoids 
 
A "sinusoidal function"  f(t)  is one whose graph is a (co)sine wave.  
 
I drew a large general sinusoidal function,  f(t) . 
 
I drew the graph of  cos(theta) ; this is our model example of a sinusoid. 
 
A sinusoidal function is entirely determined by just three measurements, 
or parameters, which determine it in terms of  cos(theta) . 
 
A = Amplitude = height of its maxima = depth of its minima  
 
P = Period =  elapsed time till it repeats  
(or, in spatial terms,  lambda = wavelength = the distance between repeats) 
 
t_0 = Time lag = time of first maximum 
 
f(t)  can be written in terms of cosine.  Clearly,  f(t) = A cos(theta). 
To work out how, express theta  as a function of  t . I started drew   
a t-axis horizontally and a  theta-axis vertically.  
When t = t_0 ,  theta = 0 .  When  t = t_0 + P ,  theta = 2pi .   
I marked these data points on all three graphs.  
 
The graph of  theta  as a function of  t  is a straight line; otherwise 
the cosine would get distorted, bunched up.  So:  
 
       theta = (2pi/P) ( t - t_0 )  
 
and so  f(t) = A cos( (2pi/P) ( t - t_0 ))  
 
The frequency is  nu =  1/P , measured in "cycles/unit time."  More useful is: 
the circular frequency  omega = 2pi/P = omega , measured in radians/unit time. 
 
So     theta = omega ( t - t_0 ) 
 
The "phase lag" is   
 
       phi = omega t_0 = (2 pi/P) t_0  . 
 
It measures the radian measure corresponding to  t = 0 .  
In terms of  omega  and  phi ,  

 
       f(t) = A cos(omega t - phi)        
 
For example,  
 
       sin(omega t) = cos(omega t - pi/2) . 
 
-- the sine lags one quarter cycle behind the cosine. 
 
 
Question 7.1. A graph of a sinusoidal function is displayed. 
The problem is to express it in the "standard form" above. 
 
1. 2 cos(4pi t + pi/4) 
2. 2 cos((pi/4)t + pi/4) 
3. 2 cos(4pi t - pi/4) 
4. 2 cos((pi/4)t - pi/4) 
5. 2 cos(4t+1) 
6. 2 cos(4t-1) 
 
     P = 8, t_0 = -1 , A = 2 : 
 
     f(t) = 2 cos( (2pi/8) ( t + 1 )) = 2 cos( (pi/4) t + pi/4 ) 
 
     omega = pi/4 ,  phi = - pi/4 . 
 
Ans: 2.  
 
 
[2] Trig sum:   a cos(omega t) + b sin(omega t) 
 
I showed the Trig Id applet. This sum seems always to be another sinusoidal 
function! How can we find its "standard form"  A cos(omega t - phi) ? 
 
Recall the cosine difference identity: 
 
     cos(theta - phi) = cos(phi) cos(theta) + sin(phi) sin(theta) 
 
   cos(omega t - phi) = cos(phi) cos(omega t) + sin(phi) sin(omega t) 
 
Now construct a right triangle with hypotenuse the segment in the plane 
joining  (0,0)  to  (a,b) .  If  A  is the hypotenuse and  phi  the angle 
at the origin, then  
 
     A = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)  
     a = A cos(phi) 
     b = A sin(phi) 
 
and 
 
     A cos(omega t - phi) = a cos(omega t) + b sin(omega t) 
 
 
Question 7.2. What are the amplitude, circular frequency, and phase lag: 
A ,  omega , and  phi in  A cos(omega t - phi) , for the sinusoid 
 
     cos(omega t) +  sqrt(3) sin(omega t) 

 
 
1.  2 cos(\omega t-\frac{\pi}{4}) 
2.  sqrt(3) cos(omega (t - pi/3)) 
3.  2 cos(omega(t- pi/3)) 
4.  2 cos(omega t - pi/3) 
5.  sqrt(3) cos(omega t - pi/3) 
6.  sqrt(3) cos(omega t - pi/4) 
Blank. Don't know. 
 
Ans:  A = 2,  phi = pi/3 :  4. 
 
 
[3] Integration 
 
Remember how to integrate  e^{2t} cos(t)  ? 
 
Use parts twice.  Or:  
 
Differentiating a complex valued function is done separately on the real and  
imaginary parts.  Same for integrating. 
 
     e^{2t} cos(t) = Re e^{(2+i)t}        so 
 
     int e^{2t} cos(t) dt = Re int e^{(2+i)t} dt  
 
and we can integrate exponentials because we know how to differentiate  
them! -  
 
    int e^{(2+i)t} dt = (1/(2+i)) e^{(2+i)t} + c 
 
We need the real part.  
 
Expand everything out:  1/(2+i) = (2-i)/5 
 
                     e^{(2+i)t} = e^{2t} (cos(t) + i sin(t)) 
 
so the real part of the product is  
 
      (1/5) e^{2t} (2 cos(t) + sin(t)) + c 
 
More direct than the high school method! 
 
 
[4] Linear constant coefficient ODEs with exponential input signal 
 
Let's try       x' + 2x = 4 e^{3t} 
 
We could use our integrating factor, but instead  
let's use the method of "optimism," or the inspired guess. The inspiration 
here is based on the fact that differentiation reproduces exponentials: 
 
     d 
     -- e^{rt} = r e^{rt} 
     dt 
 
Since the right hand side is an exponential, maybe the output signal  x    
will be too: TRY  x = A e^{3t} . This is not going to be the general  

solution, so I'll write  x_p  for it. I don't know what  A  is yet, but: 
 
    2 x_p  = 2 A e^{3t} 
 
      x_p' = A 3 e^{3t} 
 
    ----------------- 
 
4 e^{3t} = A (3+2) e^{3t} 
 
which is OK as long as  A = 4/5:  x_p = (4/5) e^{3t}  is one solution.  
The general solution is this plus a transient: 
 
      x = (4/5) e^{3t} + c e^{-2t} . 
 
 
[6]  Replacing sinusoidal signals with exponential ones 
 
Let'e go back to the original ODE   
 
 
x' + 2x = 2 cos(t) 
 
This equation is the real part of a complex valued ODE: 
 
 
z' + 2z = 2 e^{it} 
 
This is a different ODE, and I use a different variable name,  z(t) . 
 
We just saw how to get an exponential solution:   z_p = A e^{it} 
 
        2 zp = 2 A e^{it} 
         
         zp' = i A e^{it} 
 
 -----------------------  
 
    2 e^{it} = A (2+i) e^{it}   
 
so       z_p = 2/(i+2) e^{it} 
 
To get a solution to the original equation we should take the real part  
of this!  Expand each factor in real and imaginary parts: 
 
 
       z_p = (2(2-i)/5) ( cos(t) + i sin(t) )  
 
     x_p = Re(z_p) = (4/5) cos(t) + (2/5) sin(t)  
 
This is the only sinusoidal solution. To get the general solution we add 
a transient:   
 
       x = x_p + c x_h
