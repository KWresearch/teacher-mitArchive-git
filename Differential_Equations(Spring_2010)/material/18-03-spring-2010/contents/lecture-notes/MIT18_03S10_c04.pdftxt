Definition: A "linear ODE" is one that can be put in the "standard form"  
 
        _______________________________ 
       |                               | 
       |     r(t)x' + p(t)x = q(t)     |       x = x(t)   
       |_______________________________| 
 
 
r(t), p(t)  are the "coefficients" [I may have called q(t) also a coefficient 
also on Monday; this is not correct, fix it if I did.] 
 
The left hand side represents the "system," and the right hand side  
arises from an "input signal." A solution  x(t)  is a "system response" 
or "output signal." 
 
We can always divide through by r(t), to get an equation of the 
Reduced standard form: 
 
        _______________________________ 
       |                               | 
       |         x' + p(t)x = q(t)     |       x = x(t)         (*)   
       |_______________________________| 
 
 
The equation is "homogEneous" if  q  is the "null signal,"  q(t) = 0 . 
This corresponds to letting the system evolve in isolation: 
In the bank example, no deposits and no withdrawals. 
In the RC example, the power source is not providing any voltage increase. 
 
The homogeneous linear equation  
 
      x' + p(t) x = 0   
 
 
is separable. Here's the solution, 
in general on the left, with an example  (with  p(t) = 2t )  on the right: 
 
          x' + p(t)x = 0                              x' + 2tx = 0         
 
Separate:       dx/x = - p(t) dt                         dx/x = - 2t dt 
 
Integrate:     ln|x| = - int p(t) dt + c                ln|x| = - t^2 + c 
 
Exponentiate:    |x| = e^c e^{ - int p(t) dt }            |x| = e^c e^{-t^2} 
 
Eliminate the absolute value and reintroduce the lost solution: 
 

(*)_h 

 

                   x = C e^{- int p(t) dt}                 x = C e^{-t^2}  
 
 
In the example, we chose a particular anti-derivative of  k , namely  kt. 
That is what I really have in mind to do in general. The constant of 
integration is taken care of by the constant  C . 
 
So the general solution to  (*)_h  has the form  C x_h , where  x_h  is  
*any* nonzero solution: 
 
            x_h = e^{- int p(t) dt}  ,   x = C x_h 
 
 
We will see that the general case can be solved by an algebraic 
trick that produces a sequence of two integrations.  
 
 
[2] Example: Diffusion, e.g. of heat. 
 
About this time of year I start to think about summer. I put my rootbeer  
in a cooler but it still gets warm.  Let's model its temperature by an ODE. 
 
x(t) = root beer temperature at time  t . 
 
The greater the temperature difference between inside and outside, the 
faster  x(t)  changes.  
 
Simplest ("linear") model of this: 
 
     x'(t) = k ( T_ext(t) - x(t) ) 
 
where  T_ext(t)  is the "external" temperature. Sanity check: When   
T_ext(t) > T(t),  x'(t) > 0  (assuming  k > 0 ).  We get a linear equation: 
 
     x' - k x  =  k T_ext 
 
This is "Newton's law of cooling."  k  could depend upon  t  and we would 
still have a linear equation, but let's suppose that we are not watching  
the process for so long that the insulation of the cooler starts to break  
down! 
 
Systems and signals analysis:  
The system is the cooler.  
The output signal = system response is  x(t) , the temperature in the cooler. 
The input signal is the external temperature  T_ext(t) .  
 
Note that the right-hand side is k  times the input signal, not the input  
signal itself.   
 
What constitutes the input and output signals is a matter of the 
interpretation of the equation, not of the equation itself.  
 
 
Question 4.1:  k large means 
1. good insulation 
2. bad insulation 
Blank. don't know. 

 
k is small when the insulation is good, large when it is bad.  
It's zero when the insulation is perfect.  k  is a COUPLING CONSTANT 
When it is zero, the temperature inside the cooler is decoupled from 
the temperature outside.  In the construction industry, a number like   
k  is pasted on windows; it's called the  U-value  of the window. 
 
 
Let's take  k = 1/3 , for example. 
 
Suppose the temperature outside is rising at a constant rate:  say 
 
     T_ext = 60 + 6t   (in hours after 10:00) 
 
and we need an initial condition: let's say  x(0) = 32 . 
 
So the IVP is   x' + (1/3) x = 20 + 2t ,   x(0) = 32 .          (cooler) 
 
This isn't separable: it's something new. We'll describe a method which 
works for ANY first order linear ODE. 
 
 
[3] Method: Integrating factors (Euler) 
 
This method is based on the product rule for differentiation:  
 
   (d/dt) ( u x )  =  ux' + u'x 
 
For example, suppose we have the equation  
 
         t x' + 2 x = t 
 
(This is not separable; it is linear and in standard form, but not reduced 
standard form.) Here's a *trick*.  Multiply both sides by  t : 
 
      t^2 x' + 2t x = t^2 
 
The left hand side is now the derivative of a product: 
 
     (d/dt) (t^2 x) = t^2 
 
We can solve this by integrating: 
 
             t^2 x = t^3/3 + c 
 
so               x = t/3 + c t^{-2}  
 
[In the first lecture, I posed this (with a different righthand side) 
as a flashcard problem, but I did it just after describing the calculation  
of an integrating factor for a *reduced* equation. The reduced equation is 
x' + 2x/t = 1 , and this has integrating factor  t^2 . So it was a poorly 
placed question.] 
 
That was great! The factor  t  we multiplied by is an "integrating factor."  
I guessed it here. Often you can. The factor to use in the cooler equation  
and other equations may not be so obvious. Here's a calculation, for a linear  
equation in reduced form, 

 
           x' + p(t)x = q(t) 
 
Multiply both sides by  u  
 
            u x' + p u x = u q 
 
In order for the right hand side to be   (d/dt)(ux) = ux' + u'x, 
the function  u  must satisfy the differential equation  
 
                   u' = p u  
 
This is separable, and we'll carry out the separation in general in a minute. 
In the cooler equation, the coefficient  p(t)  is constant.  
In that case we have the natural growth equation!  
 
                    u = e^{pt}  
 
(I am choosing a value for the constant of integration, because I need just 
one integrating factor, any one.)  
 
In the case of the cooler problem,  p = 1/3 , so we have: 
 
      (d/dt) (e^{t/3} x) = (20 + 2t) e^{t/3}  
 
Integrate:   
 
      e^{t/3} x = 60 e^{t/3} + \int 2t e^{t/3} dt 
 
Um. Parts:      \int u dv = uv - \int v du 
 
            u = 2t  ,  dv = e^{t/3} dt 
           du = 2dt ,   v = 3 e^{t/3}  
 
     e^{t/3} x = 60 e^{t/3} + 6 t e^{t/3} - 18 e^{t/3} + c 
 
               = ( 42 + 6 t ) e^{t/3} + c 
 
Solve for  x:  
 
     x = ( 42 + 6t ) + c e^{-t/3}  
 
That's the general solution. Remember, you can check it easily. 
 
u is an "integrating factor." 
 
 
[4] We still should finish the IVP process: 
 
     32 = x(0) = 42 + c   so  c = -10 : 
 
      x = 42 + 6t - 10 e^{-t/3}  
 
 
We just want one  u , not the general  u : so the exponent could be any 
antiderivative of  p .  In the example,  p = 1/3  was constant and we took 
u = e^{t/3} . 

 
 
Note the structure of the genearal solution:  
 
     x = x_p + c u^{-1}                   where   
 
.  x_p  is a solution, *any solution*. It's called a PARTICULAR SOLUTION 
but this is a very poor name, because there is nothing particular about it. 
I this case we chose one with a pretty simple formula -- x_p = 42 + 6t .)   
 
.  u  is an integrating factor.  
  
Very often  x_h  approaches zero with time, as this one does. It is then  
called a TRANSIENT. All solutions come to look more and more alike as  
time goes on. This is a funnel!  
 
I graphed the solutions  42 + 6t  and  x , and some others along with  T_ext . 
If the temperature in the cooler is more than 60 degrees at the start, 
then it declines at first, crosses the nullcline  x = 60 + 6t  where it 
is momentarily in equilibrium with the outside, and then rises to become 
asymptotic to  42 + 6t  like every other solution.  
 
 
[5] Let's compute an integrating factor for the general first order linear  
equation  (*) :  we are to solve  u' = up . 
 
This is a separable equation:  du/u = p dt 
 
      ln|u| = int p dt  
 
The constant of integration is in the indefinite integral. 
 
     |u| = e^{int p dt}  
 
Now there is a choice of sign. Pick one and go with it; say 
 
     u = e^{int p dt}  
 
That gives you an integrating factor. Any nonzero multiple serves as well. 
 
Note that this is the reciprocal of a solution to the homogeneous equation: 
 
     u = xh^{-1}   
 
This gets fed into the solution for  x : 
 
     x = u^{-1} int u q dt 
 
and the constant of integration in the integral lets us write 
 
     x = x_p + c x_h
