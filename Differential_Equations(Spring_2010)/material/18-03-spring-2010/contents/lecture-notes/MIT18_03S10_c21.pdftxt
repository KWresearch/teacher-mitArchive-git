[1] Recall from before break:  A function  f(t)  is periodic of period  2L   
if  f(t+2L) = f(t) .   
 
Theorem: Any decent periodic function  f(t)  of period  2pi  has 
can be written in exactly one way as a *Fourier series*: 
 
     f(t) = a_0/2 + a_1 cos(t) + a_2 cos(2t) + ... 
                  + b_1 sin(t) + b_2 sin(2t) + ... 
 
If the need arises, the "Fourier coefficients" can be computed as  
integrals: 
 
     a_n = (1/pi) integral_{-pi}^{pi} f(t) cos(nt) dt ,  n geq 0  
     b_n = (1/pi) integral_{-pi}^{pi} f(t) sin(nt) dt ,  n > 0 
 
 
[2] Squarewave:  A basic example is given by the "standard squarewave,"  
which I denote by  sq(t) :   it has period  2pi  and  
 
      sq(t)  =   1  for    0 < t < pi 
             =  -1  for  -pi < t < 0 
             =   0  for    t = 0 , t = pi 
 
This is a standard building block for all sorts of "on/off" periodic  
signals.  
 
It's odd, so  a_n = integral_{-¥pi}^pi odd . even dt = 0  for all  n . 
 
If  f(t)  is an odd function of period  2pi,  we can simplify the  
integral for  bn  a little bit. The integrand  f(t) sin(nt)  is even,  
so the integral is twice the integral from  0  to  pi: 
 
     bn = (2/pi) integral_0^pi f(t) sin(nt) dt  
 
Similarly, if  f(t)  is even then   
 
     an = (2/pi) integral_0^pi f(t) cos(nt) dt 
 
In our case this is particularly convenient, since  sq(t)  itself needs  
different definitions depending on the sign of  t.  We have: 
 
     bn = (2/pi) integral_0^pi sin(nt) dt 
 
        = (2/pi) [ - cos(nt) / n ]_0^pi   
 
        = (2/pi n) [ - cos(n pi) - (-1) ] 

 
        = (2/pi n) [ 1 - cos(n pi) ] 
 
This depends upon  n : 
 
     n      cos(n pi)      1 - cos(n pi) 
 
     1          -1               2 
     2           1               0 
     3          -1               2  
 
 
and so on. Thus:   bn = 0      for  n  even 
and 
 
                      = 4pi/n  for  n  odd 
 
     sq(t) = (4/pi) [ sin(t) + (1/3) sin(3t) + (1/5) sin(5t) + ... ] 
 
This is the Fourier series for the standard squarewave. 
 
I used the Mathlet  FourierCoefficients to illustrate this.  Actually,  
I built up the function 
 
     (pi/4) sq(t) = sin(t) + (1/3) sin(3t) + (1/5) sin(5t) + ....   (**) 
 
and observed the fit. 
 
 
[3] What is "decent"?  
 
This is quite amazing: the entire function is recovered from a *discrete*  
sequence of slider settings. They record the strength of the harmonics above  
the fundamental tone. The sequence of Fourier coefficients is a "transform"  
of the function, one which only applies (in this form at least) to  
periodic functions. We'll see another example of a transform later,  
the Laplace transform. 
 
Let's be more precise about decency. First, a function is  *piecewise  
continuous* if it is broken into continuous segments 
and such that at each point  t = a  of discontinuity,  
 
     f(a-) = lim_{t ---> a  from below} f(t)     and  
 
     f(a+) = lim_{t ---> a  from above} f(t)  
 
exist. They exist at points  t = a  where  f(t)  is continuous, too, and 
there they are equal. So  f(t) = 1/t  is NOT piecewise continuous, but 
sq(t)  is . 
 
A function is "decent" if it is piecewise continuous and is such that at 
each point of discontinuity,  t = a ,  the value at  a  is the average 
of the left and right limits: 
 
      f(a) = (1/2) (f(a+) + f(a-))  
 
So the square wave is decent, and any continuous function is decent. 
 
Addendum to the theorem: 
 

At points of discontinuity, the Fourier series can't make up its mind, 
so it converges to the average of  f(a+)  and  f(a-) . 
 
 
For example, evaluate the Fourier series for  sq(t)  at  t = pi/2: 
 
     sin( pi/2) = +1 
     sin(3pi/2) = -1 
     sin(5pi/2) = +1 
            ... 
 
 
 
        so 
 
     1 = (4/pi) (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...)     or 
 
     1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...  =  pi/4  
 
Did you know this? It's due to Newton and Leibnitz. 
 
 
[4]  Tricks:  Any way to get an expression (*) will give the same answer! 
 
Example [trig id]:  cos(t - pi/4) . 
 
How to write it like  (*) ?  Well, there's a trig  identity we can use: 
 
     a cos(t) + b sin(t) = A cos(t - phi)   
     if  (a,b)  has polar coord's  (A,phi) 
 
     a = A cos(phi),  b = A sin(phi) :  
 
For us,  A = 1,  phi = pi/4, so  a = b = 1/sqrt(2)  and 
 
     cos(t - pi/4) = (1/sqrt(2)) cos(t) + (1/sqrt(2) sin(t) . 
 
That's it: that's the Fourier series. This means  a1 = b1 = sqrt(2)   
and all the others are zero. 
 
 
Example [linear combinations]:   
 
     1 + 2 sq(t) = 1 + (8/pi) ( sin(t) + (1/3) sin(3t) + ... ) 
 
 
Example [shifts]:  f(t) =  sq(t + pi/2) 
 
      =  (1/2) (4/pi) (sin(t + pi/2) + (1/3) sin(3(t + pi/2)) + ... ) 
 
sin(theta + pi/2) = cos(theta) ,  sin(theta - pi/2) = - cos(theta)   so 
 
     f(t)  =  (4/pi) (cos(t) - (1/3) cos(3t) + (1/5) cos(5t) - ... ) 
 
 
Example [Stretching]:  What about functions of other periods? 
Suppose  g(x)  has period  2L .   
 
Building blocks:  cos(n(pi/L)x)    
             and  sin(n(pi/L)x)  are periodic of period  2L . 
 

Then the Fourier series for  g(x)  is: 
 
     g(x) = a_0/2 + a_1 cos((pi/L) x) + a_2 cos((2pi/L) x) + ...  
                  + b_2 sin((pi/L) x) + b_2 sin((2pi/L) x) + ... 
 
Example:  sq((pi/2) x)  has period  4 , not  2pi :  L = 2.  But we can still  
write (using the *substitution*  t = (pi/2) x ) : 
 
     sq(2pi x) = (4/pi) ( sin((pi/2)x) + (1/3) sin(3(pi/2) x) + ... ) 
 
There are integral formulas as well. [Slide]
