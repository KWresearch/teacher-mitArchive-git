Two additions to your mathematical modeling toolkit. 
- Step functions [Heaviside] 
- Delta functions [Dirac] 
 
 
[1] Model of on/off process: a light turns on; first it is dark, then it  
is light. The basic model is the Heaviside unit step function   
 
     u(t) = 0          for  t < 0 
            1          for  t > 0 
 
Of course a light doesn't reach its steady state instantaneously; it takes 
a small amount of time. If we use a finer time scale, you can see what  
happens. It might move up smoothly; it might overshoot; it might move up  
in fits and starts as different elements come on line. At the longer time  
scale, we don't care about these details. Modeling the process by  u(t)   
lets us just ignore those details. We simplify the model by supposing 
that  u(t) = 0  for all  t < 0  no matter how near to zero, 
      u(t) = 1  for all  t > 9  no matter how near to zero, 
and   u(0)  is left undefined. 
 
u(t-a)  turns on at  t = a .   
 
 
If  a < b , u(t-a) - u(t-b)   turns on at  t = a  and off again at  t = b : 
it's a "window." 
 
 
We can use  u(t-a)  to turn on another function:    
u(t-a) f(t)  is zero when  t < a  and agrees with  f(t)  when  t > a . 
 
 
Q1:  What is the equation for the function which agrees with  
f(t) between  a  and  b  ( a < b )   and is zero outside this window? 
 
(1)  (u(t-b) - u(t-a)) f(t) 
(2)  (u(t-a) - u(t-b)) f(t-a) 
(3)  (u(t-a) - u(t-b)) f(t) 
(4)  u(t-a) f(t-a) - u(t-b) f(t-b) 
(5)  none of these 
 
Ans: (3). 
 
 
[2]  From bank accounts to delta functions.  
 

Bank account equation:  x' + Ix = q(t)   
x = x(t) = balance     (K$)  
I = interest rate      ((yr)^{-1}) 
q(t) = rate of savings (K$/yr) 
 
I am happily saving at the rate  K$1/yr.  The concept of rate can be  
clarified] by thinking about the cumulative total, Q(t) (from some starting 
time,  perhaps  t = 0); 
 
      Q'(t)  =  q(t)                   
 
or    Q(t)  =  integral_0^t q(u) du 
 
At  t = 1  I won $2K at the race track! I deposit this into the account. 
I can model the cumulative total deposit using the step function: 
 
      Q(t)  =  t + 2 u(t-1)  
 
What about the rate?  For this we would need to be able to talk about the 
derivative of  u(t) ,   in such a way that its integral recovers  u(t). 
 
Of course there is no such function. 
 
But let's approximate  u(t)  as we did before. I can differentiate each 
of them, to form a rate (varying with time).  
 
Once again, I don't care about the details. What matters is the two 
properties: 
 
- The integral is always 1 
- Concentrated very near to zero.  
 
These functions approximate *something*, written  delta(t); and 
 
      delta(t)  =  u'(t) 
 
Using this we can write down a formula for the new rate of savings: 
 
      q(t) = 1 + 2 delta(t-1)  
 
We can graph this using a "harpoon" at  t = 1  with the number 2 next to  
it; the area under the harpoon is 2. 
 
Not too long after this, at  t = 2, I bought a camera for $3K. 
 
      q(t) = 1 + 2 delta(t-1) - 3 delta(t-2) . 
 
The negative multiple of delta can be represented using a harpoon pointing 
up with  -3  next to it, or by a harpoon pointing down with  +3  next to it. 
 
 
[3]  Let me go back and be more precise about the kind of functions we 
have been using before these delta things. 
 
A function is "piecewise smooth" if it is broken up into segments so that: 
- each segment has all higher derivatives 
- at each endpoint, left and right limits of all derivatives exist. 

 
We'll call piecewise smooth functions "regular." We can now  
add in combinations of delta functions, called "singularity functions." 
A sum of a regular function and a linear combination of delta functions 
is a "generalized function": 
 
      f(t) = f_r(t) + f_s(t) 
 
For example, the  q(t)  above has 
 
      q_r(t)  =  u(t) 
 
      q_s(t)  =  2 delta(t-1) - 3 delta(t-2)  
 
I can differentiate a regular function, but if there are breaks in 
the graph the result will be a generalized function:  
Whenever   Q(a+)  is different from  Q(a-) , 
the derivative will have a delta contribution: 
 
      (Q(a+) - Q(a-)) delta(t-a) 
 
Keeping these terms in the derivative lets us reconstruct  f(t)  up to a  
constant. With the singular terms in place this is called the 
"generalized derivative."

[4] When you fire a gun, you exert a very large force on the bullet  
over a very short period of time.  If we integrate  F = ma = mx" 
we see that a large force over a short time creates a sudden change in 
the momentum,  mx' .  This is called an "impulse."  
 
I fire straight up. 
The graph of the elevation of the bullet, plotted against  t, 
starts at zero, then abruptly rises in an inverted parabola, and then 
when it hits the ground it stops again. 
 
The derivative is zero for  t < 0 ; then it rises abruptly to  v_0; 
then it falls at constant slope (the acceleration of gravity) till  
the instant when it hits the ground, when it returns abruptly to zero. 
 
v(t)  has a graph like this:

Quotes:  
 
``I consider that I understand an equation when I can predict  
the properties of its solutions without actually solving it.''

``God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world.''] 
 
 
[6: Supplement] People often want to know what the delta function REALLY IS. 
One answer is that it is a symbol, representing a certain approximation 
to reality and obeying certain rules.  
 
There are other answers.   
 
One is this: one measures the value of a function by means of a piece 
of equipment of some sort. This equipment gathers light, for example, over 
a period of time, and reports an integrated value. The time interval may 
be short but it is not of width zero. Each measuring device has a  
sensitivity profile,  m(t) ,  which rises to a peak and then falls again, 
and which mathematically is assumed to be smooth. 
 
If the light profile is  f(t) ,  what this instrument actually measures is 
 
     M(f;m) = integral f(t) m(t) dt 
 
The most we can ever know about the function  f(t)  is the collection of 
all these measurements,  M(f;m)  as  m  varies over all measuring devices. 
 
So  f  determines a new "function," sending each  m  to a number.  
This is what is called a "distribution." Notice that changing the value  
of  f(t)  at a single point doesn't change  M(f;m) :  the distribution 
determined by a function is independent of the value of the function at 
any single point. 
 
There are other ways to assign a number to each measuring device. 
For example, we can send  m  to  m(0).  That is what the "delta function" 
does: 
 
      integral delta(t) m(t) dt  =  m(0)
