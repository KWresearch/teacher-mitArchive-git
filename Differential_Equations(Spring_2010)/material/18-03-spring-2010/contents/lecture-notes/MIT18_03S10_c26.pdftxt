[1] Laplace Transform 
 
We continue to consider functions  f(t)  which are zero for  t < 0 . 
(I may forget to multiply by  u(t)  now and then.)  
 
The Laplace transform takes a function  f(t)  (of "time") and uses it to  
manufacture another function  F(s) (where  s  can be complex).  It: [Slide] 
 
(1) makes explicit long term behavior of  f(t) . 
 
(2) answers the question: if I know  w(t),  how can I compute  p(s) ? 
 
(3) converts differential equations into algebraic equations.  
 
But we won't see these virtues right away.  
 
Definition: The Laplace transform of  f(t)  is the improper integral 
 
       F(s)  =  integral_{0}^¥infty e^{-st} f(t) dt       
 
(formula subject to two refinements). 
 
We will often write   f(t) ------> F(s)  
 
and                  L[f(t)]  =  F(s)  
 
(This notation isn't so good, because there's no room for "s" on the left.) 
 
For each value of  s ,  F(s)  is a weighted integral of  f(t). 
Wnen  s = 0 , for example, the Laplace integral is just the integral of   
f(t).  When  s > 0 , the values of  f(t)  for large  t  are given less  
weight. Each value of  F(s)  contains information about the whole of  f(t). 
 
Example:  f(t) = 1 :   
 
      F(s)  =  integral_0^infty e^{-st} dt 
 
            =  lim_{T --> infty} e^{-st}/(-s) |^T_0 
 
            =  (-1/s) (lim_{T --> infty} e^{-st} - 1). 
 
If  s > 0 ,  e^{-st} ---> 0  as  T ---> infty , and we get  1/s . 
 

If  s < 0 ,  e^{-st} ---> infty  as  T ---> infty ,  and the improper 
integral diverges. 
 
Actually, I'll want  s  to be a complex number, not just a real number. 
With  s = a+bi ,  !e^{st}| = |e^{at}e^{ibt}| = e^{at} ,  and the same  
argument shows that the integral converges for  Re(s) > 0 . 
 
So this is our first calculation: 
 
             1  has Laplace transform  1/s    
 
 
[2]  For a more general function  f(t) ,  the integral will converge for  
a given value of  s  provided that  |f(t)e^{-st}|  can be integrated. 
This will happen if   
 
     |f(t)| < |e^{st}| = e^{(Re s)t} 
 
at least for  t  large. So to make the integral converge *somewhere*,  
we make the assumption that  
 
     f(t) is "of exponential order" if there is a constant  M  such that  
     for large  t  ,  |f(t)| < e^{at} . 
 
In that case, the integral for  F(s)  converges for  Re(s) >= a . 
 
Eg  e^{t^2}  has no Laplace transform. 
 
So in the definition I really meant: 
 
Refinement #1:      "for  Re(s)  large."  -- the "Region of Convergence." 
 
We'll see that the region of convergence contains important information 
and it's good practice to declare it when you state a Laplace transform: 
 
     1  has LT  1/s  with region of convergence  Re(s) > 0 . 
 
The expression obtained by means of the integration makes sense everywhere 
in  C  except for a few points -- like  s = 0  here -- and this is how we 
define the Laplace transform for values of  s  whose real part is too  
small. This is called "analytic continuation." 
 
 
[3] Powers  
 
     L[t^n] = int_0^infty t^n e^{-st} dt 
 
     u = t^n              dv = e^{-st} dt 
    du = n t^{n-1} dt      v = (-1/s) e^{-st}  
 
     = t^n (-1/s) e^{-st} |_0^infty + (n/s) int_0^infty t^{n-1} e^{-st} dt 
 
     = n/s L[t^{n-1}] . 
 
Start with  n = 1 :  L[t]   = (1/s)(1/s) = 1/s^2 . 
 
            n = 2 :  L[t^2] = (2/s)(1/s^2) = 2/s^3 

 
            n = 3 :  L[t^3] = (3/s)(2/s^3) = 3!/s^4 
 
            ...      L[t^n] = n!/s^{n+1} . 
 
The region of convergence is  Re(s) > 0 .  
 
 
[4]  These first computations can be exploited using general properties of 
the  
Laplace Transform. We'll develop quite a few of these rules, and in fact  
normally you will not be using the integral definition to compute Laplace  
transforms. 
 
 
Rule 1 (Linearity):  af(t) + bg(t) ------>  aF(s) + bG(s). 
 
This is clear from the linearity of the integral. 
 
 
Question 26.1. What is  L[(1+t)^2] ? 
 
1. (1/s + 1/s^2)^2 = 1/s^2 + 2/s^3 + 1/s^4 
2. 1/s + 2/s^2 + 2/s^3 
3. (1+t)(1/s + 1/s^2)  
4. Don't know 
 
 
[5] Rule 2 (s-shift):   If  z  is any complex number,   
 
   L[e^{zt}f(t)]  =  F(s-z)  with region of convergence  Re(s) > Re(z)  
 
Here's the calculation:   
 
   L[e^{zt}f(t)]  =  integral_0^infinity e^{zt} f(t) e^{-st} dt 
 
                  =  integral_0^infinity f(t) e^{-(s-z)t} dt 
 
                  =  F(s-z). 
 
Using  f(t) = 1  and our calculation of its Laplace transform we find 
 
      L[e^{zt}]   =  1/(s-z).   
(*) 
 
 
 
[6] As usual we can get sinusoids out from the complex exponential. 
 
Using linearity and Euler's identity 
 
         cos(omega t)  =  (1/2)(e^{i omega t} + e^{-i omega t}) 
 
we find 
 
      L[cos(omega t)]  =  (1/2)((1/(s - i omega) + 1/(s + i omega)) 
 
                       =  s/(s^2 + omega^2) 

  
Using 
 
          sin(omega t) = (1/2i)(e^{i omega} - e^{-i omega}) 
 
we find 
 
      L[sin(omega t)]  =  omega/(s^2 + omega^2). 
 
Both are convergent for  Re(s) > 0 , since  +- i omega t  lie on the 
imaginary axis.
