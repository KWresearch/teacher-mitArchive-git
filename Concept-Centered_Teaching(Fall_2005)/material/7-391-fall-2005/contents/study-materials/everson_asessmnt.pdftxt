Developing Depth of Knowledge 

•	 Students need a deep foundation of 
factual knowledge 
•	 They need to connect facts & ideas in 
the context of a conceptual 
framework 
•	 They need to connect concepts to 
prior knowledge to facilitate recall 
and application for problem solving 

Thinking about meaningful assessment -- What do you want to know? 
What meaning o you want to derive from the test? 

Most of American education is based on recall.

Application for problem solving: e.g. rate calculation (9th grade) vs. 

calculating a tax on purchase w/out a cash register. -> 

Humans don't transfer. The problem is that it is assumed that people

The Role of Teachers 

The Role of the Learner 

•  Teachers have depth of subject-
matter knowledge 
•  Connecting to students existing 
knowledge—becoming “learner 
centered” 
•  Teaching for understanding, rather 
than retrieval 
•  Assumptions about intelligence and 
transfer of learning 

•  Learning is a “constructive” process, 
active not passive 
•  Students arrive with prior knowledge, 
often with incomplete understanding 
of the subject 
•  Knowing what you know, and what 
you don’t know is key 
•  Views of one’s “intelligence” are 
central 

Role of teachers: becoming "learner-centered" rather than 
"teacher-centered." 
Teaching for understanding rather than retrieval means taking the 
time for students to elaborate in the classroom. 

Role of learner.

Learning as a constructive process. E.g. "two out, two on, bottom of 

the seventh." To understand that, one needs to know something about 

baseball and the language of baseball. 

Prior knowledge: 3&4 year olds have theories for why it's light and 

___ 
dark, etc. Theories exist, but are wrong. Not an "empty package."

Knowing what don't know: identify a point where knowledge breaks 

down. Have strategies for learning.

Views of oneself: learn slower if believe self (fixed vs. adaptive).

Assessment in the 
Service of Learning 

•	 Assessment is the art & science of 
knowing what students’ know 
•	 Assessments provide “evidence” of 
students’ knowledge, skills & abilities 
•	 Evidence supports teachers 
“inferences” of what students’ know & 
can do 
•	 Inferences guide and inform 
instruction 

4 Key Concepts 

•	 Making students’ thinking visible 
•	 Developing depth of knowledge, & 
connecting to prior knowledge 
•	 Defining the roles of the Teacher & 
the Learner 
•	 Assessing student learning, informing 
teaching 

Assessment

Assessment for understanding is harder at start-up, but when the  

"pool" is created, it evens out. Need to develop rubrics. 

Teachers "inferences" of what students know. If can't infer, 

assessment is of low value. 

Inferences guide and inform instruction. -> have to insure that 

students learn key concepts. May have to go back and re-teach if 

students are not getting it. 

Philosophy of transparency: Formative and summative assessment 

have to be separate. 

What are the topics about which you want to make inferences? 

What evidence are you going to use? ��


Making Students’ Thinking Visible 

•	 Students approach new learning with 
complex, but often incomplete, views 
of the world 
•	 If this initial understanding is not 
engaged, they often fail to grasp new 
concepts 
•	 Teachers need to “make visible” 
students’ pre-existing knowledge and 
incomplete understanding 

Making Thinking Visible 

Give out rubrics-criteria for success.

If a test is a valid criteria for learning, then announcing these criteria 

is fair. 

Grading on a curve guarantees failure for some part of the class. 

This defeats the goal of teaching a subject.��

Overview of Cognitive 
Processes 

•	 Remembering 
•	 Short-term memory 
•	 Long-term memory 
•	 Reasoning & Thinking 
•	 Inductive, deductive, abductive 
•	 Problem Solving 
•	 Rule Making 

Why Cognitive Models of Content 
Knowledge are Critical 

•	 Tell us what are the important aspects of knowledge 
that we should be assessing. 
•	 Give deeper meaning and specificity to standards 
•	 Give us strong clues as to how such knowledge can be 
assessed 
•	 Suggest what can and should be assessed at points 
proximal or distal to instruction 
•	 Can lead to assessments that yield more 
instructionally useful information -- within and across 
levels and contexts 
•	 Can guide the development of systems of 
assessments

Why Focus on Classroom 
Formative Assessment? 

•	 As instruction is occurring, teachers need 
information to evaluate whether their teaching 
strategies are working. 

•	 They also need information about the current 
understanding of individual students and 
groups of students so they can identify the 
most appropriate next steps for instruction. 

•	 Students need feedback to monitor their own 
learning success and to know how to improve. 

Assessment Centered Elements 

•	 There are frequent opportunities to 
make students’ thinking visible through 
processes of formative assessment. 

•	 Teachers try to grasp where students 
are in the development of their thinking 
and understanding of critical constructs. 

Translating Science into 

Engineering:

Principles of Assessment Design


•	 Assessment design should be based upon a 
model of student learning and a clear sense 
of the inferences about student 
competence that are desired for the 
particular context of use. 
•	 Design is recursive process – starting with the 
Student Model 
•	 The student model suggests the most 
important aspects of student achievement that 
one would want to make inferences about and 
provides clues about the types of tasks that will 
elicit evidence of students’ understanding.
