Discussion for 7.11: 

Sorting/selection (as in college admission)—prediction for future success.  
Assessment—testing of prior performance.  

Teach students to ask “have I seen this problem before?” i.e: 
1.  Define the problem 
2.  Ask “have I seen this problem before?” 
3.  What do I need to know to solve this problem? 

When you ask a student “did you study hard?” get “yes”  

Ask “what did you actually do?” Students don’t necessarily have good strategies. 


“How well do you think you are going to do?”

Can give a task to show how far off the student actually is.
