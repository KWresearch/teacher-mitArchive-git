Shape Game 
 
Each group has three buckets. Bucket I containes pieces of type I, bucket II—of type II, and 
bucket III—of type III. The goal of this game is to see how many different kinds of structures 
you can build from the pieces in your buckets. Each structure has to contain a piece of each 
type. Please remember that as you put the structures together, the color spots have to match up in 
the following way:

1.  How many structures were you able to put together? 
There were 3 complete structures and a piece of type III that did not go with any 
of them. Three other structures can be put together, but they do not stay together 
as well. 
    
2.  Are all your structures identical? If not, what are the differences? 
Two of the structures have identical final complex shape, while the third does not. 
In each complex pieces of types I and II are different than in any other complex. 
 
3.  The pieces in your buckets represent three different molecules, that together work as a 
complex in a cell.  
a). What dictates whether the pieces of type I, II, and III can form a complex? 
The complex is put together via three-dimensional shape fitting and   interactions 
of the chemical groups on the surface of the molecules.  
 
Interactions of the chemical groups are encoded in the colors:  
Blue and red—charged groups. Blue-red interactions represent ionic bonds.     
Black—polar groups. Black-black, black-blue, and black-red interactions 
represent hydrogen bonds. 
Silver—hydrophobic groups. Silver-silver interactions represent hydrophobic 
effect. 
 
The only thing you knew about each piece was its shape and coloring scheme 
(chemical properties). You put together complexes because they fit. In a similar 
sense, within a cell, two molecules interact because they can.  And if they can, 
they do. We will return to discussing this point and its implications for the rest of 
this course at the end of the section.   

 

b). Can all pieces of type I work with all pieces of type II? If not, what are the restrictions 
on the pieces in order for them to work together?  
Each piece of type I only fits perfectly with one piece of type II. The other 
combinations do not work because the shapes of the type I and II pieces do not 
match each other. 

 
c).What conclusion about molecular interactions can you draw from b)? 
I. Molecular interactions are accomplished by 3D shape fitting and interactions 
of the chemical groups on the surface of the molecules. 
 
II. A change in the shape of a molecule can render it unable to interact with its 
binding partners. 
 
III. A complementary change in the shape of a binding partner molecule can 
restore binding (and function). 

4.  What is a protein? 
A protein is a biological macromolecule composed of one or more chains of 
amino acids in a specific order. 

 
5.  What are some of the other types of biological macromolecules in a cell? 
Other types of large molecules are nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), carbohydrates, 
and lipids. 

 
6.  What is the connection between these types of molecules in the cell? 
DNA encodes proteins through an RNA intermediate. Some RNAs also perform 
other functions in the cell. Proteins do a lot of different things in the cell, 
including making new DNA, RNA, carbohydrates, and lipids.  

 
7.  What are the four levels of protein structure? 
Primary—the sequence of amino acids; secondary—the local secondary structure 
(α-helices and β-sheets); tertiary—three-dimensional structure; and 
quarternary—interactions between 3D structures, such as multiple peptides 
within a protein complex. 

8.  If we consider our models to represent protein molecules, what level of protein structure 
do the models represent? 
Tertiary and quarternary. 

 
9.  What is the first level of protein structure at which a change that led to the pieces of the 
same type having different shapes would have occurred? 
Primary—change in amino acid sequence causes the change in the 3D 
conformation of a protein.  
 
10. What are some of the different functions of proteins and protein complexes in a cell? 
Proteins perform many varied functions in the cell. Some examples are: 
antibodies binding an antigen, cell-to-cell signaling molecules binding to surface 
receptors, DNA polymerase synthesizing a new strand of DNA, lactase catalyzing 
the breakdown of lactose. Broad categories of function of proteins are: make 

 

 

stuff, break stuff down, transport stuff, signal or propagate the signal, create or 
anchor structures.  These categories can be further broken down into many 
subcategories.    

11. Do all of these functions listed above require physical interaction of molecules? Why or 
why not? 
The first step in all these and other functions in the cell is the physical contact and 
binding between molecules.  Without physical contact, a molecule can’t “tell” 
any other molecule what to do.  The only way information is propagated in a cell 
is through a series of binding events, and subsequent reactions.  In a sense, any 
molecule in a cell is also information about what happened to have the molecule 
be present.   
As we discussed, any molecule will bind any other molecule that it can, regardless 
of whether it is “supposed” to do so or not.  The binding between molecules then 
facilitates further events. This binding is only possible when 3D shapes of 
molecules fit together, and the chemical identities of the groups on the surface 
allow for binding.   
 
12. If you were given only these three protein complexes, would you be able to decide 
whether any of them would likely function normally in the cell? Why or why not? 
We would not be able to say just from looking at the three versions of the complex 
whether any except for the wild type would function normally in a cell because we 
do not know what its next binding partner is.  We also do not know how the 
complex interacts with its binding partner.   
We would expect that any complex for which the areas of the molecule involved in 
interacting with this next binding partner were unaffected by the changes in the 
protein complex would likely function normally.  However, if the complex in 
question can no longer bind its next expected binding partner, we would expect 
that this modified complex would not function normally in a cell. 

 

 

 
Each team will now get a model of the binding pocket that the protein complex interacts with.  
 

13. Can all your protein complex models fit into the pocket?  
No, one of the mutant complexes has an outer shape that excludes the ability to fit 
into the pocket.  
  
14. What conclusions about protein interactions and transmission of information in the cell 
can you draw? 
IV. We can draw the conclusion that retaining the binding of the complex (as 
discussed in 3c) above) is only useful if the complex retains its shape with respect 
to the next point of transmission of information, i.e. its next binding partner.   

15. On the molecular level, what is the only information available to the molecules? How do 
they use this information to “decide” whether to bind another molecule?  
As we discussed above, the only information available to molecules in a cell as to 
whether they should bind another molecule is whether they can. And if they can, 
they do. 

 

16. 7.014 contains a number of different units, most corresponding to different disciplines in 
biology. Do you expect that learning about the principles behind molecular interactions 
today will help you with the material in the other units of the course? Why or why not? 
Understanding the principles behind molecular interactions will help you in all 
units of the course focusing on the molecular and cellular levels because:  
-Molecules interact because they can. 
-The only information in a cell is shape and chemical identities. 
-These are encoded in or determined by other molecules which themselves have 
shapes, and the “decoding” itself proceeds by the same mechanism of shape 
fitting. (cid:206) 
-Any other level at which we describe a biological system is an abstraction that 
ultimately must have an explanation on this basic level of shape fitting and 
interaction.  
-All ways to describe and study biological systems are ways to study properties 
of these interactions.
