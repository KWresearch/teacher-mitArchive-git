A Central Challenge 

A central challenge in the redesign of AP Biology is to revise our 
thinking about how  students learn and to design instruction 
based on contemporary views of teaching and learning. 
Contemporary research in the learning sciences suggests that 
our focus must shift to reflect deeper thinking about: 
•  the structure of biological content knowledge; 
•  the integration of problem solving and reasoning into the course; 
•	 how to build on students' prior knowledge and early conceptions of 

science, in general, and biology, in particular; 

•	 course and assessment design that reflect learning with 

understanding and transfer;

identifying assessment targets along the novice to expert continuum; 
• 
•  the role of pedagogical content know ledge; and 
•  the design of knowledge-centered biology classrooms.

NAS report pointed out the need to address the issue of students 
mostly using short-term memory instead of problem-solving  and 
reasoning, the question of whether the teachers know how to teach, 
and the need for knowledge-centered rather than teacher-centered 
classrooms. 

AP Bio Redesign panel aimed to address questions of the outline of 
the course, professional development for the teachers, and assessment 
that would reflect what is actually being taught.

Now is both the best of times in science education (e.g. MIT) and the 
worst of times (e.g, secondary level). -> Won't be able to make students 
who can drive science and technology. -> Therefore, need to redesign! 
AP system is a big driver of reforms. 1.3 million AP exams last year. But 
there are a lot of students who take AP courses, but not AP exams. For 
example, in calculus, there are two students who take the course but not 
the exam for every student who takes both the course and the exam. 
In the 90s, there was a big international survey-TIM (3rd International). US 
was ranked 16th (in the middle). Clinton administration asked NAS to look at 
and make recommendations. Slide 2 is from the NAS report. 

One key observation was that AP/IB students didn't do much better on the 
TIM survey (~10th). NAS report was critical of AP -> Need to redesign AP. 
Start with biology (because of support and interest from Bruce Alberts). In 
2005, there were about 100,000 AP Bio exams given. 

Background 
•	 The Panel set out to develop a framework for AP 
Biology which would address the course, the role of 
laboratories, a new student assessment system, and 
professional development. The National Research 
Council’s (NRC) 2002 report, Learning and 
Understanding, concluded that, “existing programs for 
advanced study are frequently inconsistent with the 
results of the research on cognition and learning.” 
This challenge animated the redesign. 
•	 To meet this challenge, the College Board assembled 
a panel of distinguished secondary and post (cid:173)
secondary biology educators. Outside advice from the 
biological sciences community, researchers in the 
learning sciences, and high school and college 
science educators also informed the Panel’s 
recommendations.

Framework document is to be delivered to the College Board by the 
end of September. 

Jan '06-set up a new panel for actual redesign.

Redesign considerations.

Equity: we don't want a program for elite only. 

Quantity vs. quality: Campbell is the official textbook. But it's huge. 

Contains too much information. What to do?


The role of technology: Labs. Can good labs be delivered in an average  

HS with not much access to technology? 


For example, College Board recently funded 7 schools in the Bronx for 

AP labs in chemistry and calculus. The price was $65,000. (cid:13)(cid:10)


Can students read 3 chapters of Campbell every night? No, 
especially if ESL. -> Textbook is not learner-centered. 

For the AP Redesign framework, think about the learner: what do 
they bring to the classroom. 

We need sound assessment-need hypothesis, way to test it, evidence. 

AP Biology Conceptual Framework 

Redesign Panel’s 
Recommendations 

•  Stress the Role of Students’ Prior Know ledge 
•	 A Course Design Guided by a Conceptual Framework and 
Thematic Approach to Teaching Biology 
•  An Emphasis on Depth of Understanding vs Breadth of Content 
•  Less Is More: Limit Content Coverage 
Inquiry-Based Learning via Labs & Fieldwork 
• 
•	 Emphasize Interdisciplinary Connections to Mathematics and 
Other Sciences 
Incorporate Formative and Summative Assessment 
Increased Need for Professional Development

Proposed AP Biology Conceptual Framework.


Expect debate about the central role of evolution in the framework. 

Science as a process theme is important for learning with understanding.(cid:13)(cid:10)


Recommendations. 

Prior knowledge: What do you assume when students walk in the door (e.g. 

reading level? Statistics?)? How do we know that they know it? 

Interdisciplinary connections: Teachers need to emphasize these connections 

because students do not make them themselves. Experts have tacit knowledge

& understanding. Need to make this explicit. 

Formative assessment: do this regularly, at regular intervals. 

Question: how to infer information from formative assessment? 

Professional development: Need to invest large sums of money. The goal 

should be to make all teachers highly proficient, rather than to give AP classes  

to the most proficient teachers. (cid:13)(cid:10)


Proposed Next Steps 

•  Draft Report of AP Redesign Panel (July ’05) 
•  Survey AP Biology Teaching Community for 
Reactions, Comments, Suggestions 
•  Review and Vet Report through the National 
Academy of Sciences 
•  Move to Design Phase II 
•  Initiate Field Testing of new design: 2006-2007 
•  Complete AP Biology Redesign by AY 2008

9% of students in US are in AP-most selective educational program in the US. 
Elitism is a folklore notion of intelligence. In the US 11% of students are classified 
as gifted and talented. In Europe, it's 27%. 

Q: What are the good incentives for teachers/faculty to take advantage of 
professional development? 

HE: Question the College Board is struggling with. 

Q: How does instruction in the countries that do well/better than US compare 
to here? Is student time on task a possible answer? 

HE: For calculus, found that a big factor is teacher qualification. Probably 
because experts can make material accessible.
