***** Course Description *****
Do you like teaching, but find yourself frustrated by how little students seem
to learn? Would you like to try teaching, but are nervous about whether you
will be any good at it? Are you interested in new research on science
education? Research in science education shows that the greatest obstacle to
student learning is the failure to identify and confront the misconceptions
with which the students enter the class or those that they acquire during their
studies. This weekly seminar course focuses on developing the participants'
ability to uncover and confront student misconceptions and to foster student
understanding and retention of key concepts. Participants read primary
literature on science education, uncover basic concepts often overlooked when
teaching biology, and lead a small weekly discussion session for students
currently enrolled in introductory biology classes.
The instructor for this course, Dr. Julia Khodor, is a member of the HHMI
Education_Group.
