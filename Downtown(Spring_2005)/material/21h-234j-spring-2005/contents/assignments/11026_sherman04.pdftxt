Prologue

This April, the Trust for Public Land, a nonproﬁt conservation organization committed to preserving 
open  space  and  parks  in  cities,  released  the  startling  results  of  a  new  report:  a  comparison  of  seven 
major  U.S.  cities  had  revealed  that  Los  Angeles  had  devastatingly  little  park  space  for  its  children. 
While  seventy-eight  percent  of  Boston’s  children  can walk  to  a  neighborhood  park,  only  thirty-four 
percent  of  Los  Angeles’  children  can.  Moreover,  the  bulk  of  the  public  green  space  in  Los  Angeles 
is  concentrated  in  large  parks  far  from  the  city’s  population  centers,  leaving many  residents with  no 
access to open space at all.1 

For many Californians, these statistics are both surprising and ironic: to much of the world, the vision 
of  Los Angeles  is  one  of  low-density,  sprawling  suburban  development,  each  home with  a  carefully-
manicured lawn and a landscape dotted with green, even in the face of drought. The reality could not 
be farther from the truth, however. Los Angeles has, in fact, less public green space per capita—eight 
acres  per  1,000  people,  by  one  estimate—than  any  other  large  American  city.2  Moreover,  only  ten 
percent of the city is set aside as open space, according to another recent study by the Trust for Public 
Land,  and Los Angeles  ranks 48th  of 55 major  cities  in  its municipal  spending on parks—hardly  the 
“garden city” that exists in the imaginations of so many Americans.3 

What happened  to  these  landscapes? Many Angelenos—particularly  the wealthier residents who ﬁrst 
purchased many of  the  region’s  suburban homes—were  initially drawn  to  the  region  a  generation or 
two ago by the idyllic vistas and a desire to return to nature. Today, little of this nature is left; over the 
decades,  the  city  has  chosen  to  forego,  for  the most  part,  the  creation  of  parks  and  the  preservation 
of  open  space,  and  the  Los  Angeles  River—once  the  center  of  the  pueblo—has  been  buried  and 
forgotten. What led to this abandonment of these natural elements? And, perhaps more importantly, 
can they be retrieved? 

The  timing  of  the Trust  for  Public  Land’s  study  on  parks  in  Los Angeles  could  not  have  been more 
prophetic: even as  the  report was being prepared, plans were underway  to  re-envision one of  the key 
elements of the Los Angeles landscape, the Los Angeles River, as an urban green space. The idea is not 
a new  one, however;  in  fact,  a  riverside  park  alongside  a  revitalized  river was ﬁrst  proposed  almost  a 
century ago, and for decades since then, pockets of city residents have been calling for implementation 
of  just  such  a plan. What has  changed  in Los Angeles,  then,  that  the  city  should ﬁnally get  its  river? 
Examining the birth of the Los Angeles River Greenway and the century-long gestation of the concept 
offers a unique window  into the  imaginations of the people of Los Angeles and the  inimitable world 
of Southern Californian culture.

The River in Angeleno Culture 

For most of modern Los Angeles’ history, the Los Angeles River has been an inside joke; visitors may 
look for a beautiful Eastern-style river, but Californians know that in Los Angeles, “river” is merely the 
term for a gloriﬁed ditch. Except for periodic ﬂoods from the mountains above, the river has been dry 
for decades, much of the water diverted to irrigation and sanitation uses. What remains ﬂows through 
a riverbed coated in concrete half a century ago to force the water into concession. This “pitiful creek 
laughably called the Los Angeles River”4  has been the butt of jokes, the subject of songs on the death of 
the city, and the symbol of a city that has all but forgotten nature. Over the years, it has been co-opted 
as a temporary site for shanty towns or as the backdrop for Hollywood car chases; during a real estate 
boom in the early part of the century, unsavory agents even went so far as to sell housing lots atop the 
riverbed to unsuspecting buyers during the dry months.5 

“We  built  it,”  Army  Corps  engineers  often  say  of  the  river.  Indeed,  the  58-mile  concrete  waterway 
is  the world’s most cemented  river;  the bulk of  the  river  is also covered, making  it nearly  invisible  to 
the  city’s  residents.6  To  the  extent  that  city  residents  are  aware  of  the  river,  it  is  as  a  danger  zone,  or, 
occasionally,  as  a  skate  park  for  thrill  seekers. Newspapers  periodically  report  the  deaths  of  residents 
who  have  tumbled  over  the  concrete  banks  into  the  dry  riverbed;  in  the  wet  season,  unsuspecting 
passersby  occasionally  fall  over  the  edges  and  are  swept  away  by  the  currents.  In  fact,  there  are  so 
many  problems  along  the  riverbed  that  the  city  requires  all  schoolchildren  to  watch  a  video  called 
“No Way Out” to drill in the dangers of the concrete riverbed and discourage children from biking or 
skateboarding along its banks.7 

Today, the river does not even appear on many maps of the city; others inaccurately describe it as dry 
in  its entirety,  in spite of  the  fact  that 80 million gallons of water ﬂow along various segments of  the 
channel each day.8 Over the years, Angelenos have come to view the river as a necessary evil of the city’s 
urbanization,  an  eyesore  that protects Los Angeles  real  estate  against periodic ﬂooding but  serves no 
other real purpose. One city politician jokingly proposed that the concrete should, perhaps, be painted 
blue to evoke more of a river feel; others have proposed paving over it altogether to eliminate it from 
public view. Within  the  city  limits,  the concrete  river banks are  laden with grafﬁti and populated by 
teenagers skateboarding or surreptitiously drinking or by indigents seeking shelter for the night.9 

A River’s Story 

Pre-1780: The Gabrielino 
It was not always this way along the river. In its earliest days, the Los Angeles River ﬂowed freely through 
marshlands and swamps along the base of the Santa Monica Mountains. The ﬁrst large communities 
along  the  river  were  established  by  the  Gabrielino,  Native  Americans  who  settled  the  Los  Angeles 
2


region nearly ten thousand years ago. The river that the Gabrielino knew was strikingly different from 
the river Angelenos know today: trees lined the waterway, and lush vegetation engulfed the ﬂoodplains, 
which overﬂowed each season as snowmelt from the mountains above rushed down into the riverbed. 
Berries, watercress, sage, wild celery, and yucca all grew in the ﬂoodplain, providing sustenance; wildlife 
also  lived  throughout  the  region,  serving  as  another  food  source. The  river  was  an  integral  part  of 
Gabrielino  life;  even  the  stories passed on  through  the generations had  roles  for  the water. However, 
the Gabrielino villages, while numerous, were not densely populated; not until the Spanish settled the 
region did the population begin to tax the water supply of the Los Angeles River.10

1780-1870: El Pueblo de la Reina de los Angeles 
The  earliest  European  settlements  in  the  Los  Angeles  region,  eight  missions  and  three  presidios 
established  by  Spain  along  the Paciﬁc  coast  in  the  1770s, ﬂoundered  in  their ﬁrst  years  of  existence, 
unable to farm the land and far from sources of fresh water. When Spain looked to the north to found 
a new settlement, then, water and arable land were crucial factors. The site chosen by Felipe de Neve, 
the  ﬁrst  governor  of California  and  founder  of  the  pueblo  that would  eventually  become  the  city  of 
Los Angeles, sat alongside the Los Angeles River. Although the ﬂow of the river was unpredictable even 
in  the  eighteenth  century  before  levees  and  dams  had  been  constructed  upstream,  the  settlers  of  El 
Pueblo de la Reina de los Angeles successfully diverted enough water to irrigate their ﬁelds and sustain 
the small community.11 

One  of  the  ﬁrst  tasks  the  pueblo  settlers  undertook  was  to  construct  a  complex  web  of  zanjas,  or 
3


ditches, to carry water from the river to the pueblo. The ﬁrst zanja, the Zanja Madre, was completed 
in 1781;  it was the ﬁrst branch of what would effectively be one of the nation’s ﬁrst municipal water 
systems.12 

In  the years  that  followed  the establishment of El Pueblo de  la Reina de  los Angeles,  the community 
grew rapidly, spurred ﬁrst by the successful grain industry, later by the expansion of lucrative vineyards 
throughout  Southern  California,  and  ﬁnally  by  the  Sacramento  gold  rush  of  1848.  By  1835,  Los 
Angeles  had  eclipsed  San  Francisco  as  the  center  of  settlement  in California.13  Settlers  continued  to 
ﬂood the region throughout the decade that followed, and by the time California was granted statehood 
by the United States in 1849, the zanja system was providing water for a veritable city, irrigating more 
than 8,000 acres and bringing drinking water to thousands.14 

1870–1910: A New Century 
By  the 1870s, America was changing  rapidly. As  the  railroad  stretched across  the country, California 
became  easily  accessible  to  the  East  for  the  ﬁrst  time,  spurring  unprecedented  population  growth. 
The  Southern  Paciﬁc  Railroad,  the  ﬁrst  transcontinental  railroad  to  reach  Los  Angeles,  arrived  in 
1876; during  that decade,  the young city’s population nearly doubled. When a  second cross-country 
railway,  the Atchison, Topeka, &  Santa Fe,  opened  in  1886,  a  series  of  fare wars  began. At  the  peak 
of these battles, ticket prices to travel from the Midwest to Los Angeles were as low as one dollar, and 
Americans ﬂocked to the Paciﬁc, spurring a real estate boom that brought $100 million and sixty new 
towns to Los Angeles County in 1887 alone.15 

Much of this real estate was sold in Eastern cities to buyers who had never seen Los Angeles, however, 
and—while  many  promoters  were  honest  with  their  clients—many  others  painted  an  idyllic  view 
of  the  landscape,  distributing  images  of  the Los Angeles River  as  a  full-ﬂowing  (and  very  blue)  river 
reminiscent of  the  rivers of  the East. Buyers arrived  to discover, much  to  their distress,  that  the  river 
was,  in  fact,  only  an  ephemeral  river,  running  dry  in  the  summer  months;  it  was  the  beginning  of 
Angelenos’ discontent with their water supply.16 

The  rapid  population  growth  in  the  waning  years  of  the  nineteenth  century  created  a  critical  need 
for a larger domestic water supply, and the Los Angeles City Water Company, the company that had 
managed the city’s water since 1868, set out to secure existing water supplies and ﬁnd new sources. The 
zanjas were quickly running dry: by 1902, there more than 128,000 Angelenos, each consuming, on 
average, 306 gallons of water each day, three times the average in many Eastern cities. Because the Los 
Angeles City Water Company did not meter most homes, residents saw little reason to conserve water, 
thrusting the city into a water crisis when, in 1904, drought struck.17 

Even in the face of severe water shortages, however, Angelenos continued to consume water at extremely 
4


high  rates, watering  lawns  and  gardens  as  the  surrounding marshes were  drained  and water  supplies 
in  the  Solano  and  Elysian  Reservoirs,  built  in  1903  as  part  of  Elysian  Park  and  capable  of  holding 
15.8 million  gallons  of  water  collectively,  dwindled.  A  solution  was  needed—and  in  late  1904,  one 
emerged.18

1910–1930: Tapping the Owens Valley 
The  search  for  water  ultimately  brought  the  Los  Angeles  City  Water  Company,  then  headed  by 
engineer William Mulholland, to the Owens Valley. Former Los Angeles Mayor Fred Eaton had been 
a  proponent  of  looking  to  the  Owens  Valley  for  water  for  years,  but  the  valley  was  more  than  two 
hundred  miles  from  the  city,  and  most  had  mocked  Eaton’s  suggestion.  After  a  trip  to  the  region, 
however, Mulholland was  sufﬁciently  impressed  that  he  initiated  a more  in-depth  investigation  into 
the  possibility. The  study  revealed  that  constructing  an  aqueduct  to  carry  water  across  the  Mojave 
Desert and through the San Gabriel Mountains would cost the company upwards of $23 million—an 
unheard of sum  in 1904. But the valley was capable of supplying 325 million gallons of water a day, 
seven times what the Los Angeles River could provide.19 

In spite of the price tag, the city moved forward with plans to build a 233-mile aqueduct between the 
Owens Valley  and  Los  Angeles,  although  the  plan was  kept  as  quiet  as  possible  to  prevent  potential 
backlash  from  residents  of  the  Owens  Valley  area.  Between  1905  and  1907,  city  voters  approved 
nearly  $25  million  in  bonds  to  purchase  land  and  water  rights  and  construct  the  aqueduct,  and 
the  Mulholland  slowly  began  to  obtain  the  necessary  real  estate  rights.  Although  the  people  of  the 

5


Owens Valley protested the move vehemently when they heard—the morning that the plan was made 
public, the local newspaper, the Inoyo Register, ran a headline reading “Los Angeles Plots Destruction, 
Would Take Owens River, Lay Lands Waste, Ruin People, Homes and Communities,”20  and residents 
attempted to physically block the construction, only to be overpowered by the machinery and political 
will of the big city—Owens Valley water began ﬂowing to Los Angeles in 1913, averting a water crisis 
for growing metropolis. The political scandal surrounding the acquisition of the water would remain 
a part of Los Angeles lore for generations to come, however.21 

Although the new aqueduct dwarfed the river in scale, the waterway would not be forgotten so easily. 
In  the  years  immediately  following  the  opening  of  the  aqueduct,  the  riverbed  was  entirely  dry;  in 
fact, developers even began to site small new towns directly atop the riverbed, and General Petroleum 
Corporation opened  a plant  in  the dry  channel.22  A  collective  amnesia developed  among Angelenos; 
few worried about or even remembered the ﬂoods of the 1880s. 

The winter of 1913–1914 brought an especially intense El Niño season, however, and for the ﬁrst time 
in decades, violent storms hit the Los Angeles region, dropping up to nineteen inches of rain in some 
areas. Every river in the region overﬂowed, ﬂooding nearly twelve thousand acres of land and washing 
out  bridges  and  levees  all  along  the  Los  Angeles  River.  Railroad  service  was  suspended  for  nearly  a 
week, and the city was cut off from the rest of the country. Public outcry called for better ﬂood control 
measures, and the battle to permanently tame the Los Angeles River began.23 

Throughout  the  1920s,  debates  on  ﬂood  control  ensued.  As  the  real  estate  boom  began  to  wane, 
newcomers  increasingly  began  to  buy  ﬂood-prone  land  along  the  river’s  ﬂoodplain,  making  ﬂood 
protection  even  more  critical.24  Engineers  initially  proposed  a  series  of  stronger  levees  that  would 
contain the river to a very narrow channel and open up land along the water’s edge for development—a 
boon  in  a  county where  land  values were  skyrocketing. Later  plans  focused  on  the mountains  above 
the city, the source of much of the river’s ﬂow; planned dams and reservoirs would contain the water, 
eliminating the need for improvements along the river in the city itself.25 

The 1930s: A Vision for Los Angeles 
As county engineers produced plans  to constrain  the  river and  increase buildout  in  the metropolitan 
area,  citizens began  to  take  an  active  interest  in  the project  for  the ﬁrst  time.  In 1927,  the Chamber 
of Commerce, spurred by wealthy Angelenos who had moved to the region for its natural beauty and 
were  increasingly  concerned  that  new  plans  for  the  riverbed  would  destroy  physical  features  of  the 
landscape, convened a Citizens’ Committee on Parks, Playgrounds, and Beaches to explore options for 
parks and open space within Los Angeles County.26 

The committee, composed primarily of high-proﬁle residents from areas like Hollywood and Beverly 
6


Hills,  tasked  the  landscape  architecture  and  city  planning  ﬁrms  of  Olmsted  Brothers  of  Brookline, 
Massachusetts and Harland Bartholomew and Associates of St. Louis, Missouri with the creation of a 
plan to integrate the river modiﬁcations with a grander scheme for a Los Angeles parks system. 

The  Olmsted/Bartholomew  plan  sought  to  preserve  the  Los  Angeles  coastline—quickly  becoming 
engulfed  by  development—and  to  create  a  network  of  parks  and  playgrounds  to  “improve  health, 
reduce  delinquency,  and  promote  citizenship”  in  the  city’s  poorer  neighborhoods.27  The  Olmsted 
Brothers  (and  Frederick  Law  Olmsted,  Sr.,  who  had  established  the  ﬁrm  a  generation  earlier)  had 
already  created  some  of  the  nation’s most  renowned  park  spaces: New  York’s  Central  Park,  Boston’s 
Emerald Necklace, Washington’s Rock Creek Park, Chicago’s South Parks, and numerous other urban 
parks across the country. Los Angeles, with its unique natural resources, presented a new challenge. 

The  plan,  Parks,  Playgrounds,  and  Beaches  for  the  Los  Angeles  Region,  proposed  dramatic  changes 
to  the  landscape  of  Los  Angeles  County.  Designed  to  provide  open  space  for  a  steadily  growing 
population—by  the  late 1920s, over 350 new Angelenos were  arriving  each day,  and  the population 
of the metropolitan area had swollen to 2.2 million—the plan included a network of parks along the 
coast and through the city of Los Angeles at a cost of nearly $30 million.28 The design would serve both 
as  a  ﬂood  control  mechanism—using  the  riverbed  and  surrounding  basins  as  recharge  areas  for  the 
water  table  and protection  against  river overﬂows, much  as Olmsted, Sr.’s plan  for Boston’s Emerald 
Necklace had done—and as a last-ditch effort to purchase and preserve Southern California’s coastline 
and undeveloped green space. 

This  “‘Olmsted  vision’  of  open  space,”  as  historian Mike Davis  dubbed  it,29  met  with  disdain  from 
all but a few of the committee members. The plan, presented  just months after the devastating stock 
market crash of 1929, was a public works project well beyond the scope of what the city and county 
had imagined. In the late nineteenth century, social reform and public health movements had actively 
promoted  parks  projects  as  a  tool  for  mitigating  the  effects  of  increased  urbanization,  and  the  City 
Beautiful  movement  had  sparked  interest  in  urban  green  space.  But  by  the  early  1930s,  large-scale 
urban  projects  were  becoming  rarer  and  rarer;  instead,  federal  and  regional  funds  were  increasingly 
directed towards power development and reclamation projects of a much grander scale. Moreover, the 
plan relied on a regional parks department that did not yet exist, and passing local bond issues to fund 
such an endeavor in an era of spreading unemployment, sacriﬁce, and poverty was nearly impossible. 

Not surprisingly,  then,  the Olmsted/Bartholomew plan was resoundingly rejected. The price  tag and 
overwhelming  size  of  the  project  doomed  it;  the  committee  and  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  even 
opted  to  refrain  from  printing  copies  for  city  ofﬁcials  and  members  of  the  committee,  as  they  had 
initially  planned  to  do.  “[T]his  thing  has  taken  of  my  own  time  and  the  time  of  the  committee  to 

7


The original Olmsted/Bartholomew plan for Los Angeles. (Hise and Deverell) 
such an extent here that I can’t afford to give more time to it,” Chamber of Commerce director J. Hill 
declared. “If you want  to kill  this  thing,  let’s kill  it. Let’s not  let  it die a  long death…Let’s kill  it now 
and  get  it out of  the way…Let’s kill  it  and  get  a  vote on  it.”30 The proposal was  summarily  rejected, 
and Los Angeles’ hopes for a park system were tabled indeﬁnitely; the plan would become “a window 
into a lost future,” buried for decades.31 

The years following the rejection of the Olmsted/Bartholomew plan saw a wholesale transformation of 
the Los Angeles landscape, and especially of the city’s waterways. The industrial revolution had ﬁrmly 
established itself in Southern California, and factories along the riverfront siphoned off water for their 
own uses, reducing the ﬂow to a trickle along many parts of the riverbed. Like so many of the Eastern 
rivers, the Los Angeles River quickly became severely polluted—a quality that was exacerbated by the 
fact that water only ﬂowed intermittently through many areas. 

Two  devastating  ﬂoods—the  ﬁrst  in  1934,  the  second  in  1938—also  dealt  tremendous  blows  to 
Angelenos’ perceptions of  the  river. Even  today, Los Angeles  is waging a war against  the elements; as 

8


development encroaches on the base of the mountains and pulls at the trees and vegetation, the soil is 
disrupted and the natural landscape altered. When summer brings ﬁres, the developed areas burn more 
readily, leading to mudslides and ﬂoods when the winter rains come. The cycle erodes the earth along 
the coast and at the bases of the mountains; slowly, Southern California is crumbling into the sea.32  In 
many respects, it is not a region that nature intended for human development, as Angelenos discovered 
during the 1930s. Floods washed away homes, took lives, destroyed the bridges and railways that men 
had  labored  to build. Cries  rose up  to  tame  the  river  and  constrain  it  to  its banks  to protect  the  real 
estate at its edges. 

Beginning  in 1935,  that  is  exactly what  transpired. The  federal government  stepped  in with  a $13.9 
million  allocation  from  the  Works  Progress  Administration  (WPA),  and  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of 
Engineers  set  to work  conquering  the  San Gabriel  and  Los  Angeles Rivers.  After  the  Flood Control 
Act  of  1936  expanded  the  Corps’  authority,  the  group  took  full  control  of  the  river.  Initial  surveys 
found  many  faults  in  Los  Angeles  County’s  planning  and  construction  process,  but  rather  than 
rebuild the endangered  infrastructure, the Corps opted to contain the Los Angeles River to a narrow 
channel. Because much of  the  river’s ﬂoodplain had already been  subdivided and  sold  for  residences, 
the  Corps  felt  obligated  to  protect  present  and  future  homes,  even  at  the  cost  of  the  natural  water 
system. Concrete was  poured  along  ﬁfty-one miles  of  river,  boxing  the water  in;  only  a  few miles  of 
the  waterway  were  left  with  “soft”  ground—necessary  in  some  areas  because  water  needed  to  seep 
back into the underground water table, and in others because bedrock beneath the river threatened to 
interfere with the concrete.33 

The “Great Storm” of 1938, which brought 26 inches of rain to the Los Angeles region, killed hundreds 
of  people,  and  destroyed  nearly  5,000  homes,  contaminated  the  city’s  water  supplies,  forcing  many 
Angelenos  to  wait  for  supplies  to  be  dropped  in  by  air  as  the  city  declared  a  state  of  martial  law.34 
Although  work  on  the  river  was  already  underway,  the  1938  ﬂoods  reasserted  the  importance,  in 
residents’ minds, of the process; the Corps’ work enjoyed tremendous public support. 

Work  on  the  channelization  of  the  river  continued  through  the  Second World War  and  throughout 
the 1950s; by the time the Corps completed the work in 1959, the river had been transformed into a 
series of ﬂood control reservoirs, debris basins, and concrete  streams.35  For all practical purposes,  the 
Los Angeles River vanished from the psyches of Southern Californians. 

Re-Envisioning a River 
For the next several decades, very little was spoken about the Los Angeles River or its place in the city’s 
urban  landscape.  Although  utopian  writers  and  environmentalists  periodically  bemoaned  the  river’s 
loss—Garrett Eckbo’s 1949 work Landscape for the Living and the planning ﬁrm EDAW ’s 1965 report, 
9


Urban Metropolitan Open Space Study, both extolled the values of green space and the waterway36—the 
conversation was largely muted. 

In  1983,  however,  things  began  to  change.  In  Owens  Valley,  where  residents  who  remembered  the 
valley’s  last  stand  in  the  1920s were  still  deeply  resentful  of  Los Angeles,  citizens  voted  to  take  back 
control  of  the  valley’s  ground water, which  at  the  time  provided  eight  percent  of  Los Angeles’ water 
supply. Runoff from the valley provided another sixty-ﬁve percent, making any attempt on the part of 
valley residents to regain control of the water potentially devastating for Los Angeles. 

“We want them to get to know these water rights are not unlimited,” said Cindy O’Connor, a member 
of the Inyo County water commission helping lead the uprising against Los Angeles.37  In the years since 
Los Angeles began  to pump water out of Owens Valley,  the  region had  gone  from  a  sea of orchards, 
vineyards, and  farms to a graveyard of dead trees resembling “dried brown porridge at the bottom of 
a white  porcelain  bowl,”  in  the words  of Washington  Post writer  Jay Mathews. Although  little  came 
of  the Owens Valley  residents’  assertion  of  their  water  rights,  Los  Angeles County  took  notice. The 
already-strained water supply was a point of contention, especially since water from Washington and 
Oregon was increasingly limited; for the ﬁrst time, the city recognized that a long-term plan would be 
necessary to plan for the region’s twenty-ﬁrst century water needs. 

A River Freeway 
In  the  wake  of  the  Owens  Valley  dispute  came  one  of  the  most  dramatic  proposals  yet  to  reshape 
Angelenos’ visions of water: transportation planners in Los Angeles County proposed turning the dry 
concrete  riverbed  into  an  alternate  freeway  route  to  relieve  congestion  along  the  city’s  overburdened 
roads. The project, endorsed by California State Assemblyman Richard Katz, proposed building carpool 
lanes  along  the  riverbed  to  accommodate  trafﬁc  volume  during  the  dry  seasons.  In  1989,  county 
ofﬁcials recommended that the county Transportation Commission authorize a $100,000 expenditure 
to formally explore the idea.38 The notion behind this “river road” was that the river channel—typically 
dry for as many as 300 days each year—was already so far removed from its natural state that it would 
serve the city better as a roadway than as a waterway.39 

The idea was not entirely new: during the Second World War, trucks transported munitions along the 
channel, and for decades Hollywood has ﬁlmed chase scenes along the concrete ﬂoor. “An L.A. River 
commute would be  the ultimate off-road experience,  something  for every native  southern California 
driver  to  savor,  except  during  ﬂash  ﬂoods,”  wrote  Jay Mathews,  relishing  the  idea.40  The  California 
Transportation Department extolled the virtues of such a model, telling stories of an elevated highway 
system that could span the length of the river through Los Angeles to provide additional travel lanes. 

Modern  California  culture—at  least  in  Southern  California—revolves  around  the  automobile,  and 
10


even  the  threat  of  ﬂash  ﬂoods  did  little  to  deter  Californians  from  the  notion  that  opening  the  Los 
Angeles River  bed  to  trafﬁc might,  at  some  level,  save  them  from  themselves.  Plans  to  add  a  second 
deck  to  the Harbor  Freeway  had  been  abandoned  after  the  1989  San  Francisco  earthquake wreaked 
havoc on a similar roadway in Oakland, California; suddenly, the solidly-grounded riverbed seemed a 
viable option.41 

If Angelenos were waiting  for  a  rallying  cry,  the  freeway  proposition was  it. When  the  proposal was 
made  public,  residents  all  over  the  city—from  schoolchildren  to  retirees  to  planners  to  the  mayor 
himself—spoke out against it. As the community mobilized, a collective vision for the river began to 
emerge for the ﬁrst time. 

“A Mad Vision”: Bradley’s vista 
Out  of  this  chaos  stepped  the man  some  dubbed  the  savior  of  the  river. Tom Bradley, mayor  of Los 
Angeles  from  1973  to  1993,  was  among  the  strongest  advocates  of  a  restored  river,  envisioning  an 
“oasis of beauty and opportunity” modeled after similar initiatives in cities like San Antonio, Texas.42 
Bradley’s image of a riverwalk, bike trails, and picnic areas called to mind many of the elements of the 
original Olmsted/Bartholomew plan for the region: carefully-planned open spaces that simultaneously 
served the recreational needs of the city and evoked visions of nature that the concrete riverbed lacked. 
It  was  to  be,  in  the  words  of  one  journalist,  “one  of  those  watery  ﬂowing  things  with  green  banks, 
willow trees and ﬁsh swimming in it…you know, a real river.”43 

Bradley’s vision was an unheard of proposal for a river that the city had all but forgotten, and in the ﬁfth 
year of one of  the  region’s  longest droughts, Angelenos  greeted  the  concept with  skepticism,  in  spite 
of their desire to save the riverbed from becoming a sea of trafﬁc. To begin with, such a revolutionary 
change in the Los Angeles River would have necessitated a fundamental change in lifestyle for those who 
lived along  it. In the early 1990s, businesses routinely dumped wastewater—suds  from  laundromats, 
noxious  chemicals,  and  other  toxins  that  would  be  illegal  to  dump  in  almost  any  other  American 
river—into the river channel, where the pollutants would trickle along the concrete until the sun dried 
them.  In  other  areas  of  the  riverbed,  teenagers  skateboarded  along  the walls,  and  homeless men  and 
women slept against the concrete. 

Bradley  persisted, however,  and  eventually  the City  of Los Angeles  created  a  citizens  committee  and 
city task force to explore options for the river and propose potential plans. The city found an unlikely 
ally  in  the process:  the poet Lewis MacAdams and his  river preservation organization, Friends of  the 
Los Angeles River  (FoLAR).  FoLAR,  created  in  1985  as  an  artists’  celebration  of  the  river  that  once 
was,  had  grown  over  the  years  into  coalition  of  ardent  river  advocates,  many  of  whom  had  highly-
politicized,  antagonistic  relationships with  the  city. FoLAR  advocated  a  complete  renaturalization  of 

11


the river—a far cry from Bradley’s vision of a recreational waterway and park. However, the two groups 
shared a common enough vision to open a dialogue; in the years to come, both would be instrumental 
to the river revitalization process.44 

Meanwhile, Katz continued to push for further consideration of the expressway plan, which had been 
temporarily  stymied  by  Bradley’s  counterproposal  and  jurisdictional  issues  surrounding  ownership 
of  the  riverbed.  “It  may  not  be  an  ideal  answer,  but  anything  that  will  reduce  trafﬁc  congestion  by 
twenty  percent,  you’ve  got  to  take  a  look  at,”  Katz  argued.45  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers, 
skeptical  of  all  of  the  proposed  plans,  debated  the  viability  of  uses  that  did  not  explicitly  deal  with 
ﬂood control. However, their proposed alternative, extending the river’s concrete walls even further to 
prevent overﬂows, met with great opposition from both groups. “I want this to be a river,” MacAdams 
said of the Corps’ plan. “…Los Angeles already has enough concrete.”46 

Even  among  restoration  advocates,  however,  there  were  conﬂicts:  should  the  river  be  restored  to  its 
natural condition and allowed to re-vegetate and ﬂow freely each season? What would become of the 
communities—hundreds of them—that sat within the river’s natural ﬂoodplain? Would a more viable 
option be to create a parks system of recreational green space that might coexist with the concrete ﬂood 
control mechanisms? 

“Just  calling  it what  it was,  a  river,  that  seemed  like  a  radical  act,”  says MacAdams  of  the  early  days 
of FoLAR. 47  “…I thought the basic task was to convince people how much better the river could be. 
But then I realized: I ﬁrst had to convince people that there was a river.”48  The  initial makeup of the 
group—artists,  poets,  and  writers—was  critical  to  its  early  success  because,  he  explained,  “you  had 
to  [be  able]  to  see  something  that  wasn’t  there.”49  Other  environmental  groups  agreed,  noting  that 
the  river  revitalization  was  as much  about  process  as  about  preservation. Tree  People,  a  Los  Angeles 
organization focused on renaturalizing the river and cleaning the city air, found that river cleanups could 
be  powerful  tools  in  engaging  youth  in  the  process;  other  groups  had  similar  experiences  organizing 
neighborhoods around new visions of the landscape.50 

The Flood of 1992 
Los  Angeles’  war  against  the  land  escalated  in  early  1992,  hitting  a  new  crescendo  as  ﬂoodwaters 
swept  through  the  city  in mid-February. The  pattern  of  ﬁres,  ﬂoods,  and mudslides  has  plagued  the 
region  for  over  a  century,  but  Angelenos  have  a  remarkable  ability  to  forget  the  disasters,  be  they 
ﬂoods,  earthquakes, or droughts.  “The decay  rate of  the memory of  a ﬂood  is  very  rapid,” Brigadier 
General Gerald Galloway,  an  Army  engineer working  on  ﬂood  control,  said  in  an  interview.  “Every 
time we have a ﬂood we are reminded how we have ignored the lessons of the past.”51 The ﬂash ﬂoods 
of 1992 brought the reality of the river back into the Los Angeles psyche with a dramatic rush as the 

12


Los Angeles River overﬂowed not once, but twice, and then-Governor Pete Wilson declared a state of 
emergency in the county.52 

The  storm,  one  of  the  worst  Los  Angeles  had  seen  in  a  century53,  brought  over  nine  inches  of  rain 
to parts of the city  in only two days—more precipitation than the region had seen  in all ﬁve years of 
drought.54  Falling rocks and mudslides destroyed homes and cars outside of the city limits, and seven 
deaths  were  linked  to  the  rains,  including  several  Angelenos  who  fell  into  or  made  the  mistake  of 
playing in the concrete river channel and were swept away by ﬂoodwaters.55 

The 1992 ﬂoods prompted a heated discussion on the politics of ﬂood control. For nearly a century, the 
federal  government had been  insuring  and  compensating homeowners  for ﬂood damage,  even when 
homes had been built in established ﬂoodplains; time and time again, buildings on those ﬂoodplains 
were  rebuilt,  only  to  be  destroyed  by  the  next  ﬂood.  Over  the  decades,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of 
Engineers  had  attempted  to  mitigate  ﬂood  damage  along  the Western  rivers  by  constructing  dams 
and  levees  to  regulate  the  ﬂow  of water.  Along  the Mississippi River,  however,  a  similar  process  had 
failed  to  contain  the  river,  and  ultimately  the Corps  permanently moved  residents  to  higher  ground 
and  allowed  the  river  to  retake  over  35,000  acres  of  its  original  ﬂoodplain  at  a  cost  of  $6  billion.  In 
California, however, development had not only  failed  to move  away  from  the ﬂoodplain, but  in  fact 
had increasingly infringed upon it, with compensated ﬂood losses nearly doubling between 1951 and 
1992.56  “The market is saying you’re nuts to live in a ﬂood plain, but the Federal Government is saying 
it’s not only okay, but we’ll make it affordable,” said Scott Faber, director of the ﬂood plains program 
for  American  Rivers.57  For  the  ﬁrst  time,  residents  began  to  speak  out  about  the  risks  and  costs  of 
building a city in a ﬂoodplain; it was the ﬁrst step towards a resolution. 

While  the  logical  solution  might  have  been  to  move  Los  Angeles  residents  away  from  the  river’s 
ﬂoodplain,  the  Corps  acknowledged  at  the  time  that  such  a move  was  unlikely  in  a  city  that  values 
space and real estate so highly. Instead, the Corps planned to raise the river’s concrete walls even higher 
at a taxpayer cost of nearly half a billion dollars.58 The Los Angeles County Drainage Area Project was 
designed  to protect property along  the  river, but  it  relied on older mechanisms of ﬂood control, and 
failed to limit new development in the ﬂoodplain, perpetuating problems with ﬂood risk.59 The future 
of the river, perennially in limbo, became more and more prevalent in Angelenos’ minds. 

An endangered river 
In  1993, American Rivers,  a  river  conservation  organization,  released  its  annual  “endangered  rivers” 
list  and  identiﬁed  the Los Angeles River  as  the most  endangered  urban waterway  in  the  country—a 
devastating,  if  unsurprising,  blow  for  the  city  that  bolstered  public  support  for  a  master  planning 
process for the river. Over the next year, the Corps’ plans for the waterway became public, and abruptly, 

13


the pockets of mobilized citizens began to come together with a collective voice. 

Plans for the new river walls provoked violent reactions from the many conservation groups that had 
been  ﬁghting  to  save  the  river.60  Environmentalists  warned  that  higher  walls  would  drive  property 
values  down,  contribute  to  urban  blight,  and—most  signiﬁcantly—have  only  a minimal  impact  on 
the channel’s ability to contain ﬂooding. But cities and towns along the river, including Los Angeles, 
saw  the  extended  walls  as much-needed  ﬂood  insurance.  As  the  battle  between  the  proponents  and 
adversaries  of  the  ﬂood  control  plan  escalated,  others  jumped  into  the  fray. The  Los  Angeles  Times 
decried  the  plan,  declaring  that  “the  battle  over  ﬂood  control  on  the  Los  Angeles  River  is  really  a 
ﬁght for its soul.“61  A slew of editorials, all scathingly negative, followed over the next year, and public 
opinion swayed towards FoLAR and their allies. 

By  the  mid-1990s,  only  two  stretches  of  natural  waterway  remained  along  the  Los  Angeles  River; 
FoLAR had pressed the county to extend these natural zones into the surrounding ﬂoodplains to allow 
water to ﬂow through the region unbounded by concrete. The return to nature, FoLAR argued, would 
encourage  wildlife  to  return  to  Los  Angeles  region. Moreover,  restoring  the  natural  riparian  habitat 
could protect the steelhead trout who were found only in that small stretch of the Los Angeles River; 
the trout had not been able to complete their migration to the Paciﬁc Ocean since 1940, the last year 
the path was not entirely cemented.62 

Stopping the Corps’ plan to extend the river walls was not a simple matter, however. The conservation 
organizations—or “creek freaks” as many Angelenos has taken to calling them—ultimately ﬁled a lawsuit 
against  Los  Angeles  County,  alleging  that  the  county  was  in  violation  of  California’s  environmental 
regulations  because  it  had  failed  to  consider  alternative  plans  for  the  river.  As  the  suit,  ﬁled  in  Los 
Angeles County Superior Court, dragged on, however, construction on the project began. 

In July 1996, much to the surprise of all of the players, the Superior Court found in favor of FoLAR, 
ordering  the  county’s  Board  of  Supervisors  to  reexamine  whether  the  environmental  impact  report 
had, in fact, met state standards. The board immediately found the report adequate, however, and the 
only discernible outcomes of the case were the creation of a Los Angeles River Watershed Task Force 
and the hiring of an independent consultant, who was given a year to produce an alternate plan for the 
river.63  In other  regards,  the victory was  fruitless  for FoLAR: construction continued on  the  riverbed 
during the year the consultant worked on a new plan, making it unlikely that any alternate plan would 
be adopted. 

“It has happened before…”: Models for Los Angeles 
Los Angeles is not the ﬁrst city to return to its river roots, however. It is one of an increasing number 

14


of cities across the United States (and beyond) who have begun to reclaim waterfronts once tainted by 
industry and cut off from communities by highways, railroads, industrial and commercial zones, and 
other trappings of civilization. 

In Boston, where the Charles River long served as “a visual backdrop for Boston…a river to drive across, 
jog alongside, bicycle next to, sail upon and admire from the bank, but not, under any circumstances, 
a  river whose waters  anyone would  dare  touch,  let  alone  swim  in  or, God  forbid,  drink,”64  a  similar 
renaissance had started in the late 1970s. For the ﬁrst time, Bostonians started to recognize that much 
of the city’s character was deﬁned by the river and the urban open space surrounding it—a stark change 
from  the  concepts  of  urbanism  that  had  dominated  Boston  and  other major  American  cities  in  the 
1960s and early 1970s, when urban  renewal efforts had  focused on building newer, bigger buildings 
in the downtown areas.65 

In Massachusetts,  the  task  of  restoring  the  Charles  River  was  nearly  as  daunting  as  in  Los  Angeles: 
city residents had to be taught to re-imagine the river, to visualize it as a green space free of the stigma 
that had come to symbolize the waterway. “Bostonians don’t understand the Charles the way Parisians 
understand the Seine and Londoners the Thames,” said Robert Zimmerman, then-head of the Charles 
River Waterfront  Association.  “All  over  the  world,  people  have  love  affairs  with  rivers,  but  not  the 
Charles. There’s an attitude against the Charles, and the only other river in the same category is in Los 
Angeles, where the river is in a concrete bunker. Maybe the problem with the Charles is that it’s been 
so manipulated.  It was  a  sewer,  and  then Back Bay was  constructed,  and buildings on Beacon Street 
face inward, away from the Charles, because the river was a source of such stench nobody even wanted 
to look at it.” 

Advocates  of  revitalizing  the  river  had  help  in  the  form  of  the  federal  Clean  Water  Act  and  new 
state environmental legislation passed in the late 1970s that helped to clear the Charles of dangerous 
pollutants,  and  the  Charles  River Watershed  Association,  which  had  been  founded  a  decade  earlier 
with  the  restoration  of  the  river  as  its mission, was  growing  rapidly. Over  the  next  twenty  years,  the 
Metropolitan District Commission  (MDC),  then  the governmental body overseeing  the  state’s parks 
and waterways, endeavored to regain control of land along the Charles River, buying back parcels from 
corporations or retailers who were operating alongside the water.66 

Building the Los Angeles River Greenway 
Neither  is Boston  alone  in  its  efforts  to  re-imagine  a waterfront;  the movement  to  restore  parks  and 
waterfronts  spread  across  the  nation  in  the  late  1990s.  San  Francisco’s  Golden  Gate  Park  is  awash 
with  wildﬂower  meadows  where  piles  of  hypodermic  needles  once  sat  neglected;  the  cities  of  St. 
Louis  and  Providence  have  both  unearthed  forgotten  rivers  of  their  own,  restoring  them  to  the 
15


public  consciousness  and  leveraging  their  redevelopment  to  spur  economic  growth  in  downtown 
districts. The unrivaled economic boom of the late 1990s played a large role in this ecological rebirth, 
jumpstarting  revitalization  of  deindustrialized  cities  and  spurring  renewed  interest  in  many  of  the 
private organizations that support the nation’s parks and wilderness.67 

Change  has  been  slow  to  come  to  the  Los  Angeles  River;  the  political  and  legal  battles  that  have 
raged since the mid-1990s have made the implementation of any plan, large or small, extraordinarily 
contentious. Moreover, it has been an uphill battle to reclaim the river’s public image. “Landscapes tell 
stories,” ﬁlmmaker Wim Wenders declared at a 1999 conference on revitalizing the river, “and the Los 
Angeles River tells a story of violence and danger.”68  Overcoming the river’s reputation as a symbol of 
crime, vagrancy, homelessness, and disinvestment will be a long process. 

In early 1999, however, the ﬁrst sign of the city’s new vision for the river emerged when Los Angeles 
announced a $10 million plan to revitalize a stretch of the river upstream to create an urban greenbelt.69 
“It’s ﬁnally starting  to come  together. I  think we’re starting  to convince people  that, yes,  this  is a real 
river, not a storm sewer,” said Melanie Winter, current executive director of Friends of the Los Angeles 
River. “What does almost every community in L.A. share besides the freeways? They share a river.”70 

Only  a  year  later,  California  voters  passed  Propositions  12  and  13,  earmarking  $2.1  billion  for  the 
creation and expansion of the state’s parks, coastland, deserts, mountains, and open space and another 
16 

$2  billion  for  the  improvement  of water  quality  and  ﬂood  control.  Proposition  12,  the  parks  bond, 
is  the  largest  in  the  state’s  history;  the  bond,  which  passed  by  a  vote  of  nearly  sixty-ﬁve  percent,  is 
targeted not only at wilderness areas, but at neighborhoods within the state’s cities and towns that are 
in dire need of parks and playgrounds, goals vaguely reminiscent of Olmsted and Bartholomew’s plan 
to create parks, playgrounds, and beaches in Southern California.71 

The California state legislature then approved a record $115 million—much of it funded by Proposition 
12—to  create  a  series  of  parks  along  the  Los  Angeles  River,  woven  together  by  biking  and  walking 
paths that would stretch from the San Fernando Valley to Long Beach. Another $45 million would go 
towards the purchase of sixty acres of land near Elysian Park; the land, formerly used by Union Paciﬁc 
as the Taylor switching lands, would become the ﬁrst state park to be created in over a generation.72  All 
of  the parks,  to be managed by  the State Parks Department, will  serve as both green  space and ﬂood 
control mechanisms. “With one fell swoop we’re going to turn the Los Angeles River from an eyesore 
into  a  jewel  running  through  the  city,”  said  California  State  Assemblyman  Antonio  Villaraigosa.73 
Instrumental to the effort were the small areas that FoLAR had restored as models for what might be 
done were the entire river revitalized. In the years since FoLAR’s creation, the organization’s community 
cleanups  have  removed  hundreds  of  tons  of  garbage  from  the  riverbed,  and  afﬁliate  organizations 
have  planted  over  10,000  sycamore  trees  along  the  water’s  edge.  “It’s  important  that  we  invest  in 
communities  that  didn’t  have  parks,  and  create  open  space  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  in  those 
neighborhoods that have been blighted,” Villaraigosa said. 74 

The quest for parks is far from over for Los Angeles, however. Revitalizing the river will entail redirecting 
substantial  quantities  of  groundwater  or  runoff  if  it  is  truly  to  be  a  viable  waterway;  currently,  as 
much  as  ninety  percent  of  the  ﬂow  during  the  dry  season  comes  from  the  city’s  treated  sewage.75 
Critics  of  the  greenway  project  also  question  how  effectively—and  at  what  price—the  antiquated 
concrete  channelization  can  truly  be  replaced  with  the  newer  methods  of  ﬂood  control  that  would 
make restoration of the river and ﬂoodplains possible.76 

What  has  caused  this  sudden  change  in  Angelenos’  perceptions  of  green  space?  Those  who  have 
watched this transformation take place have pondered this at length: is this indicative of a new fear of 
the suburban sprawl that has long dominated development in the Los Angeles region? Has frustration 
with  out-of-control  trafﬁc  congestion  forced Californians  to  reconsider  their  predecessors’  unilateral 
rejection of a parks system? Are people simply responding to growing concerns about quality of life in 
a city often stigmatized for its pollution and sprawl? 

Whatever  the  reason,  the  shift  towards  greener  thinking  is  evident  in  Angelenos’  willingness  to  pay 
higher  taxes  to  infuse  the metropolitan  region with more open  space. “We’re  seeing a paradigm  shift 

17


in thinking,” said Corey Brown, a director of California’s chapter of Trust for Public Land, a nonproﬁt 
organization that has been instrumental in helping the state and local governments acquire and preserve 
park  lands.77  In  the  early  1990s,  California’s  policy  towards  preserving  and  creating  open  space  was 
virtually nonexistent; budget crises  tied  the hands of  the  state government, and  in 1996, California’s 
state  land acquisition ofﬁce was closed. There  is a great deal of ground to be recovered with this new 
inﬂux of capital, then, including nearly a decade of maintenance that was neglected or ignored during 
the  lean  recession  years  of  the  early  1990s.78  The  cause  was  bolstered  in  2002,  when  a  third  bond 
measure, the California Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks, and Coastal Protection Act of 
2002 (Proposition 40), secured an additional $2.6 billion in state funds for the preservation and creation 
of parklands.79  Called “the most elegant park bond” in California history by State Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley, Proposition 40 added critical resources to the state’s open space initiatives.80 

18


Taylor Yard and Chinatown Cornﬁelds 
With the new funding, the process of building the Los Angeles River Greenway—named for the parks 
system  proposed  by  Olmsted  and  Batholomew—is  ﬁnally  beginning,  albeit  slowly. The  ﬁrst  urban 
parks  in  the  system  are  currently  under  construction  at  the  edge  of Chinatown. While  the  concrete 
banks of the river will be retained in this area to protect the homes in the working class communities 
along the edge of the water, community groups and city schoolchildren have come together to replant 
the land along the edge of the river barriers with native trees and vegetation.81 

The city has also increased spending on street sweeping, trash pickup, and education on water cleanliness 
in  order  to meet  county  requirements  that  no  garbage  enter  the  Santa Monica  Bay  by  2015;  today, 
mountains of trash are often swept into storm drains, into the Los Angeles River, and subsequently out 
into the bay. Los Angeles had initially joined 22 neighboring cities and towns in suing the Los Angeles 
Regional Water Quality Control Board over  the policy, adopted  in September 2001, on  the grounds 
that  it  incurred  dramatic  costs  for  local  communities.  The  regulation  also  requires  municipalities 
to  reduce  trash  by  10  percent  each  year.  However,  the  city  dropped  out  of  the  suit  and  reached  an 
independent settlement that would both meet the board’s requirements and contribute $168 million 

19


to cleaning up the Los Angeles River.82 

California’s most recent land acquisition for 
the  Los  Angeles  River  Greenway,  a  17.8-
acre  swath  of  land  south  of  the  Glendale 
Parkway, will ultimately connect the Taylor 
Yard  State  Park,  which  sits  just  north  of 
downtown,  to  the  river  itself.  Again,  the 
funding for the purchase—$10.5 million— 
comes from Proposition 12 monies. Unlike 
the  stretch  of  river  that  runs  through  the 
heart of Los Angeles, however, the area south 
of Glendale Parkway is soft-bottom, free of 
concrete in order to allow water to seep into 
the  ground  and  recharge  the  underground 
waterways.  Its  acquisition,  then,  is  good 
news  for  environmentalists  and other  river 
advocates  who  would  ultimately  like  to 
see the state restore  links between the soft-
bottom  and  concrete  portions  of  the  river 
to allow wildlife to move freely throughout the greenway.83 

The  vision  does  not  end  here,  however.  FoLAR,  Unpaved  LA, Tree  People,  and  other  conservation 
organizations in the Southern California region would one day like to see the Los Angeles River used 
not only  as  a ﬂood  control mechanism, but  as  a means of  supplying  the  city with water.  Impervious 
surfaces currently cover over  seventy percent of Los Angeles;  if  rainfall and  runoff could be collected 
by creating a pervious surface that could absorb the water and relay it into water tables, the city could 
meet nearly half of its water needs itself.84 

As the Los Angeles River re-emerges in the imaginations of Angelenos, the potential for the development 
of parks and other open spaces along its edges will only grow. In the few years since writer Mike Davis 
and  historian  Blake  Gumprecht  re-introduced  Californians  to  the  Olmsted/Bartholomew  plan  for 
Los  Angeles’  parks,  interest  in  the  proposal  has  grown  astonishingly. The  master  plan  for  the  river 
produced by the city  in the  late 1990s has also met with accolades from residents who are beginning 
to realize the ramiﬁcations of a center city without urban nature; as Los Angeles reﬂects on its past and 
re-envisions its future, Angelenos may ﬁnd that—surprisingly, and perhaps unexpectedly—a river still 
runs through the heart of the city.
