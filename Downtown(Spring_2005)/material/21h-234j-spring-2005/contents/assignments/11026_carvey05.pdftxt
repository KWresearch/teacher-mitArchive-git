Publix Theater 
Combat Zone, Boston 
 

 “I can remember going to the Publix in the late '70's, when it was in sorry 
disrepair, but I recall looking up at all the boxes and balconies and 
thinking how sad it was that such a beautiful theatre had fallen on such 
hard times.”1

 
As the credits rolled and the lights came back up that night in 1983, the degree of 
disrepair became obvious.   
 
Like the walls and ceiling, the once decorative plasterwork had been painted white; by 
then it was beginning to crack and fall away from the proscenium arch, the balconies and 
the boxes. A closer look at the plaster would reveal that it had once been painted gold and 
where the white paint was flecking off, specks of magenta and green peeked through 
revealing a hint of a greater grandeur in times past.  
 
Indeed, when the doors to the Gaiety Theater first opened, on November 23, 1908, her 
patrons encountered a “splendidly decorated”2 baroque style3 auditorium, richly 
decorated in magentas, reds and golds4,5.  The day before an article in the Boston Herald 
had raved, “The seats are large and comfortable, and the aisles are wide” and a sub-
headline from The Boston Sunday Globe praised the theater as a “Model of Comfort, 
Complete in Stage Equipment and Accommodations of Every Kind—Well Lighted, Well 
Ventilated, and Up to Date in All Respects is This New Home of Vaudeville and 
Burlesque.”

As the last movie patrons trickled out into the Combat Zone, ready for the night’s next 
activity, they were incognizant, or perhaps just indifferent to the fact that her last show 
was now behind her.  When the doors to the former Gaiety (since renamed the Publix) 
closed that night, it marked the end of her life as a theater.  Seven decades of use and 
minimal maintenance had rendered the once resplendent theater in a state of decrepitude.  
Though there were still some other tenants in the building, the auditorium was never to 
open again.   
 
Over the years, she declined even more.  On the exterior, the “Publix” marquee was taken 
down; inside the theater seats were stripped out, brass railing removed, and the plaster 
decorations, already showing their age, cracked and crumbled even further.   
 
The Gaiety was dying, and no one seemed to care, but as the year 2001 was drawing to a 
close, that was all about to change.   
 
 
The Setting 
 
In 1986, Boston’s Combat Zone wasn’t generally considered prime real estate.  Though 
the area had acquired that name during WWII6, in 1974 this stretch of lower Washington 
Street was rezoned as Boston’s only adult entertainment district and the moniker became 
indissolubly linked to the turpitudes of the “honky-tonk” business7. But the speculative 
mind of the real estate developer thinks differently.  Thus, in 1986, Kensington 
Investment Company seized on the opportunity to purchase 665 Washington Street – “to 
hold for development”8
 
One and a half decades later, Kensington was finally ready to act.  On December 10th, 
2001, the company filed a Project Notification Form (PNF) with the Boston 
                                                
 
6  In the 1940s, enlisted-men would come to the tailor shops in the area to have their uniforms altered.  (The

Redevelopment Authority (BRA)9 in which they proposed construction of the Residences 
at Kensington Place – a 28-story structure on the corner of Washington and LaGrange 
Streets10,11.  Kensington had previously put forth a similar plan in early 1995 but, due to a 
number of circumstances/questions concerning their potential neighbors and investors, 
the effort was dropped shortly thereafter12.  By the end of 2001 though, an established 
demand for more housing close to downtown proved that the developer’s fifteen years of 
speculation and patience was about to pay off, spelling the end for the Gaiety.   
 
 
Significant enough 
 
The first to voice concern over the proposed razing of the theater was The Boston 
Preservation Alliance (BPA).  Having reviewed the Environmental Notification Form 
(ENF) the developer had submitted to the Massachusetts Environmental Protection 
Act (MEPA) Office, on December 26th, 2001 the BPA wrote to the MEPA to express 
why this demolition should be questioned.  They noted that Clarence Blackall, “one of 
the foremost theater architects in the country”13 in his time, had designed the building.  
Also stating that the building’s façade, “plays an important role in the lower Washington 
Street streetscape” the BRA called upon the MEPA to require an Environmental Impact 
Report (EIR) for the project to address several issues including potential alternatives to 
demolition14. Though the MEPA concluded that the preparation of an EIR would not be 
necessary, they indicated that Kensington would be required to reach a Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) with the Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC) to address the 

                                                
 
9  The Boston Redevelopment Authority was established in 1957 and controls all of the planning and 
development in the City. 
10  The project would include 300 residential units (10% affordable) as well as retail space along 
Washington Street. (Project Notification Form (PNF), 12/10/01)  Because of the proposed scale of the 
development, it would be subject to Large Project Review by the BRA. (REF?)

loss of the Gaiety – a structure listed on the Inventory of Historic and Archaeological 
Assets of the Commonwealth15. 
  
The review process for the Kensington Place project began with the Scoping 
Determination16. A request made during this stage for Kensington to examine and 
evaluate alternatives that would “eliminate, minimize, or mitigate”17 the Gaiety’s 
demolition, including adaptive reuse or inclusion of the theater in the development. The 
Developer would be required to attach studies investigating the feasibility of retaining the 
structure when they submitted the Draft Project Impact Report (DPIR).  However, if the 
studies concluded that reuse was not within reason, they would not be required to act on 
any proposed alternatives. 
 
 
Demolition Delay and the BLC 
“A city without old buildings, is like a man without a memory18”  
 
Some have alleged that, in order to smooth the approvals process for a project, developers 
are quick to raze whatever may exist on their property.  It is, after all, clearly easier to 
obtain approvals when there are fewer avenues for challenges to a proposal, and, besides, 
the political cost for granting approval is greatly reduced as there are few people who 
would take to the streets to protect the status quo when the status quo is a vacant lot.  
Whether or not Kensington was hoping to employ such a tactic for their project is a 
matter of some debate.  All that can be certain is that not long after submitting their DPIR 
in July 2002, Kensington applied for the demolition permits needed to clear their lot.   
 
                                                
15 Pursuant to Section 11.03(10)(b)(1) of the MEPA regulations  
16 Scoping Determination is the first step in Large Project Review.  Its purpose is to determine the specific 
impacts the developer must examine in detail in the draft Project Impact Report (DPIR), the next step in 
the review.  The topics include transportation, environmental protection (wind and shadow, daylight, air 
quality, noise, groundwater, construction impacts) urban design, historic resources, infrastructure 
systems, and site plan (Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), “A Citizen’s Guide to Development 
Review under Article 80,” 2004, pg 6-9; Letter from Richard Mertens to the BRA (1/22/2002) to be

In 1975, the Boston Landmarks Commission (BLC) was established as the City's historic 
preservation agency.  The Commission consists of nine members including two 
architects, an architectural historian, a city planner, a landscape architect, an individual 
nominated by Greater Boston Real Estate Board, one nominated by the Greater Boston 
Chamber of Commerce and two selected “at large” by the mayor based on their 
demonstrated knowledge and concern for conservation; all are appointed by the mayor 
for a term of three years19.  The BLC is charged with identifying and preserving historic 
properties, it functions together with local Historic District Commissions as stewards of 
Boston’s 7,000+ individual landmarks and additional historic buildings, places, and 
neighborhoods.  In 1995, with the addition of Article 85 to the Boston Zoning Code, the 
Landmarks Commission was given the additional task of regulating the demolition of 
property so as to avert the destruction of properties where potential historic preservation 
has not yet been given proper consideration20.  
  
Because the Gaiety was included on the Inventory of Historic and Archaeological Assets 
of the Commonwealth21, it was considered to be a significant structure and thus subject to 
demolition delay review.  After a preliminary evaluation of the case by staff at the 
Landmarks Commission, a demo delay hearing for the Kensington application was 
scheduled for the next Landmarks meeting.   
 
 
September 24, 2002 – Demo Delay Hearing 
 
The Kensington hearing was the second item on the Landmarks meeting agenda that 
evening.   Coincidentally, it was preceded by a discussion of alternatives (rehabilitation 
versus demolition) for the Modern Theater, another early 20th Century theater that went 
on to obtain Landmark status, located a few blocks up Washington Street from the

Gaiety.  To be considered were the proposed demolition of the Gaiety Theater (659-665 
Washington Street), the Glass Slipper (15-17 LaGrange Street), 1-13 La Grange/669-679 
Washington Streets and 25 La Grange Street.22
 
After the standard demolition delay script had been read, Ms. Ellen Lipsey, the Executive 
Director of the BLC, read the staff findings and comments for the case.  Based on the fact 
that three of the structures pending demolition could be classified as “significant,” she 
concluded that it would be appropriate for the commission to invoke demo delay.22  
 
Obviously, this was not the decision the developer had been hoping for.  Quickly, 
Matthew Kiefer, attorney for the Kensington project, countered, pointing out that, as per 
the BLC’s Theater District Survey of 1979, none of the buildings in question were 
considered significant enough to merit Landmark designation.  The Gaiety had been 
scored as IV23; the others had received even lower scores.  If the buildings had already 
been determined not to be “significant” enough for landmark designation – the only cause 
for which the BRA could offer protection from the wrecking ball – then what could 
justify a delay?  The floor was next open to public comment.  Several Boston residents 
had learned of the situation facing the Gaiety and attended the hearing to advocate for 
demo delay.  After hearing one argument in favor of delay from Boston Resident Steve 
Jerome, who cited the Glass Slipper as an important remnant of the once residential 
character of the area that was worthy of preservation, the commission voted 8-0 in favor 
of the demolition delay, which was thenceforth imposed for 90 days. 22   
 
Kiefer immediately asked the commission to waive the delay given that Kensington was 
approximately two months away from reaching a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)

23 This survey was “an in-depth architectural and historic survey of the theater area of the Boston Central 
Business District… [that made] recommendations for the National Register and Boston City Landmark 
designations.”  It evaluated the relative significance of 20 of Boston’s theaters, which were ranked in 
1981 on a I-VI scale.  The Gaiety’s IV (“non-contributing”) which replaced it’s prior “recommended for 
future consideration as individual National Register Listing” indicated it was ineligible for designation 
as a Boston Landmark or individual listing on the National Register. (Staff Comments, BLC meeting and 
public hearing, 11/26/2002)

with the MHC that would mitigate any historical losses.  As the BLC can waive demo 
delay if it finds that “no feasible alternatives” exist to demolition24 Kiefer also noted that 
the existing buildings could not feasibly be reused in the Kensington project.  His request 
was echoed by Heidi Burbidge, the project manager from the BRA, who added that there 
would be an opportunity for public comment before the project was finalized.25   
 
Others, including Lee Eiseman, Steve Jerome, and Frank Cullen, the director of the 
American Vaudeville Museum, spoke in favor of the demo delay, opining that the Gaiety 
Theater should be preserved and reused.  Eiseman even submitted information to the 
commission to illustrate the historical importance of the theater.  Shirley Kressel, co-
founder of the adamant preservation advocacy group Alliance of Boston 
Neighborhoods (ABN)26, stated that demo delay was the right way to proceed, given that 
the Kensington project was still not a certainty.  The delay would be appropriate as it 
strove to “minimize the number and extent of building demolitions where no immediate 
re-use of the site is planned.”27,25
 
Though Ralph Cole, president of Kensington Investment Company, assured Kressel and 
the commission that demolition would not occur until all of the project approvals and 
permits had been obtained, the Landmarks Commission did not waive the demo delay 
and the meeting was adjourned. 25  
 
 
The Friends of the Gaiety Theater  
 
In the weeks that followed, several members of the public who had favored the delay at 
the hearing joined forces.  Calling themselves “The Friends of the Gaiety Theater”

(hereinafter, the FOTG), their first action was to seek landmark designation for the 
structure.   
 
Twelve registered Boston voters (ten are required) signed a petition seeking to designate 
both the exterior and the interior of the theater and submitted it to the BLC28. The petition 
included the following reasons for recommendation: 
 

“Designed by Clarence H. Blackall, perhaps the most experienced and leading theater 
architect of his time, the Gaiety Theater is his last remaining heretofore unprotected 
theater and a cornerstone in the architectural and historical patrimony of the city and the 
nation.  …[it] was constructed to the latest fireproofing and structural standards of its 
day….  Like the Colonial and Metropolitan Theaters, Blackall designed the façade of the 
Gaiety as an office building which, in its massing and scale, relates harmoniously to the 
surrounding cityscape…. As a major surviving theater of the famed Boston Rialto, 
famous actors and actresses have played the Gaiety, including Sammy Davis, Jr., whose 
career was launched here. ” 29,30

 
The petition was received on November 12th, 2002 and the preliminary landmark hearing 
set for two weeks later.31
 
A little over a week after submitting the petition, Jack Little, Stephen Jerome and Lee 
Eiseman (respectively the President, Vice President and Clerk of the FOTG) attended 

 
                                                
28 The Commission is responsible for determining which “place[s], structure[s], building[s], fixture[s], 
object[s] or landscape or topographic feature[s]” receive landmark designation.  Landmarks have “in 
whole or part… historical, social, cultural, architectural or aesthetic significance to the city and the 
commonwealth, the New England region or the nation.” (MGL, Chapter 772, Section 2, definition of 
“landmark”)  Only properties meeting at least one of the following criteria may be considered for 
designation: a) inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places; b) prominent identification with an 
important aspect of the economic, social and political history of the city, the commonwealth, and the 
region; c) significant association with the lives of outstanding historic personages; d) representative of 
elements of architectural design embodying distinctive characteristics of a type inherently valuable for 
study of a period, style or method of construction or development, or a notable work of an architect, 
landscape architect, designer, or builder.  (BLC, pg 37) 
29 Landmarks Petition Form for the former Gaiety Theater, submitted 11/12/2002 
 
30 The claim that Sammy Davis, Jr. performed at the Gaiety was based on interviews performed by the 
FOTG; it was never substantiated. (FOTG, pg 15) 
31 The regulations of the BLC (section 2.2, pg 4, as amended) require that hearing be held within 30 days of 
the filing of the petition.

BSA Historic Resources Committee’s (HRC) monthly meeting in order to gain support 
from this group.  In particular, they wanted to present evidence to illustrate why the 
Gaiety’s level IV ranking was lower than it should be32. 
 
Noting that Boston had lost many historic theaters over the past two decades, Jack Little 
stressed the importance of not losing another one to the wrecking ball.  He also described 
the “unusual sense of spaciousness combined with intimacy” that Blackall professedly 
achieved at the Gaiety, as not only a unique architectural characteristic/achievement, but 
also one that, he believed, lent the theater well suited to reuse.  Lee Eiseman added his 
concern that the proposed development would also require the demolition of a townhouse 
dating from the 1830s.   
 
Two HRC members, Jackie McBride (also a member of the ABN) and Michael De 
Lacey, added their support for preservation, respectively chastising the loss of theaters in 
the Midtown Cultural District (MCD)33 and suggesting that, if restored, the Gaiety would 
help maintain a connection between theaters on lower Washington Street and those on 
Tremont Street.  However as an entity, the HRC did not adopt a position of support.   
 
 
Issues of Acoustics  
 
At the demo delay hearing, Ralph Cole had granted a request by Lee Eiseman for a visit 
inside the Gaiety34.  In early November 2002, Eiseman, several FOTG and Dr. David 
Griesinger, a psychoacoustical consultant enlisted by the FOTG, were allowed on a brief 
site visit to the theater35.   
 
                                                
 
32 Meeting notes, BSA HRC meeting, Nov 2002  
33 Adopted in 1989, one of the goals of the Midtown Cultural District Plan is “to revitalize Midtown as the 
region's center for performing and visual arts by rehabilitating historic theaters and creating new cultural 
facilities for the city's nonprofit arts community” (BZC, Article 38-1) [See APPENDIX C for complete 
Article 38-1; See APPENDIX D for a map of the MCD 
34 Minutes, BLC meeting and public hearing, 9/24/2002 
35 FOTG, pg 24

After the visit, Griesinger raved about the quality of the theater’s acoustics,  
 

“The designers took measures to reduce the reverberation time to the point where speech 
would be easily understood.  Along the sidewalls above the first balcony are panels that 
are [were] filled with horsehair padding.  With such an acoustic treatment in place, The 
Gaiety would have an excellent compromise between acoustics for speech and acoustics 
for music.”36   

 
Such a compromise would have been especially useful for burlesque performances as 
these shows included unaccompanied speech, solo and choral singing, and orchestral 
music that could sometimes be rather raucous37.  
 
After careful analysis of the test recording samples he had collected during the site visit, 
Griesinger concluded that the acoustics in the Gaiety Theater were among the best in 
Boston38.   
 
Proponents of preserving the Gaiety have alleged that Blackall collaborated with Wallace 
Sabine in the design of the Gaiety.  As Sabine is often considered the “father of modern 
acoustical engineering,”39 such association with a significant person might bolster 
support for the landmark petition.  Sabine is known to have used similar panels40 and, by 
1911, Blackall was working with Sabine in the design and construction of his theaters; 
but there are no records or hard evidence to indicate that the two men collaborated on the 
Gaiety.  Furthermore, Blackall’s writings from 1908 indicate that, at that time, he 
believed experience to be far more valuable than scientific theory in acoustical design.  
Even Griesinger could conclude only that the panels were strong evidence that Sabine 
had worked on the theater at some time41.  Historian Dr. Emily Thompson reached a

similar conclusion that would tend to suggest only a post-construction collaboration at 
best: 
 

“It is certainly possible, and even likely, that Blackall enlisted Sabine to ‘correct’ the 
acoustics of The Gaiety…. Sabine professed disdain elsewhere for using felt in a building 
under construction, so the presence of a felt-like substance in The Gaiety suggests he was 
brought in too late to be able to contribute to a more architecturally-integrated 
solution.”42  

 
Others have argued against any relationship with Sabine suggesting instead that the 
padding was installed decades later, in the 1930s or 1940s, when the theater was 
remodeled and equipped to show films.  This judgment is based on the observation that 
the “decorative overlay” on the panels matches that of the projection booth added during 
the remodel.43  No formal analysis of the fabric was ever undertaken.44   
 
 
A Bit more History  
 
Theaters had been offering various forms of entertainment in Boston since the 1790s.  
Given Boston’s Puritanical roots, it is perhaps not surprising that at least one of the early 
theaters, the Boston Museum, housed “a gallery of curiosities” including displays from 
local museums, wax tableaux and taxidermied animals in addition to the “lecture hall” 
where theatrical performances were given45.  
  
But by the turn of the 20th century, driven in part by immigration, urbanization and 
increases in prosperity and leisure time, virtually all types of entertainment were 
flourishing in the city.  In this “heyday of the theater,” a person could have his choice of

“plays, vaudeville, burlesque, comic performance, novelties, melodrama, travelogues, 
Turkish dancers [or] ‘follies of the day’” at one of Boston’s 20 theaters46.   
  
The Gaiety Theater was designed and built for the performance of burlesque – a low-cost 
form of, usually racy, live entertainment enjoyed predominantly by the working class47.  
These shows invariably included performances by comedians, variety acts and short 
sketches; there was also the requisite “chorus line of girls in tights, led by female stars 
known as soubrettes.”  Shows traveled from city to city on one of two circuits – the 
Empire Circuit, centered in the Midwest and also known as the Western Wheel, and the 
Columbia Circuit (Eastern Wheel)48.    
 

“Each [circuit] established ties with theaters in major cities.  Each had its own producers 
and its own personality.  The Empire Circuit tested the limits of civic tolerance with its 
"hot" shows emphasizing the displayed female body and blue humor.  Columbia's first 
president, Samuel A. Scribner, encouraged "refined" revues and musical comedies 
acceptable to women and middle-class men.  Boston's Gaiety Theater was part of the 
Eastern/Columbia Wheel.”49  

 
For sixteen years, shows from the Columbia circuit played at the Gaiety Theater.  Many 
of these shows “received lavish praise… practically [achieving] the eminence of musical 
comedy”50; many were done by once well-known producers, and starred vaudevillians 
and burlesquers who, though mostly unknown in the 21st century, were very popular in 
their day and genre51.  However, no shows actually originated at the Gaiety, and as such 
it has been argued that the theater did not contribute notably to the development of this 
particular form of entertainment52.

Different opinions  
 
In advance of the preliminary landmark hearing, the BLC was flooded with letters 
regarding the upcoming decision.   
 
Frank Cullen sent a three page essay entitled “Boston: Birthplace of American Vaudeville 
– The People’s Art Form” in which he praised several of the theater’s noteworthy 
architectural features and extolled its role as the common man’s entertainment in the 
early 1900s53.  Boston City Councilors John Tobin and Michael Ross wrote in support of 
the petition, as did the Pro Arte Chambers Orchestra and many other concerned citizens.   
 
Not everyone had such fond sentiments for the preservation of an old theater.  The 
Boston Preservation Alliance, one of the first groups to have questioned the proposed 
demolition, wrote to the BLC to emphasize that their concerns had always been more 
about the scale of the proposed project and less about the loss of that particular historic 
structure.  The Alliance also remarked that, having thoroughly reviewed materials from 
the petitioners, they did not believe there was enough new evidence to support the 
undertaking of a study report54.   
 
Henry Moss, co-chair of the HRC, had visited the theater on November 25th and based on 
his visit concluded that it would be “pointless” to upgrade the theater’s rating to III 
because too much of the theater’s original integrity had been lost to warrant nomination 
as a Boston Landmark.  He granted that, though the building appeared structurally sound, 
most of the interior would require a complete reconstruction to recreate the original 
appearance.  Finally, Moss expressed his belief that saving and reusing the building as a 
theater would not be economically feasible55.

Landmarks Commissioner Thomas Green, who had also visited the structure, shared his 
belief that, though the petition was interesting, based on what he had seen on the tour, the 
building did not warrant landmark status.  Green also noted: “The huge balconies and 
relative small orchestra would make a ‘reuse’ unlikely….”56   
 
 
Staff comments 
 
In advance of the preliminary hearing, “staff comments” were prepared by Ellen Lipsey 
that noted many points for the Commissioners to keep in mind when making their 
evaluation of this petition.   She remarked that the comments were lengthier than usual 
given the “passion” of the petitioners, the impending threat of demolition, the fact that the 
development process for the property had already begun and, notably, the fact that the 
Boston’s preservation community did not agree on significance of the Gaiety Theater57.   
 
The comments included pertinent findings from the Boston Theater District Survey and 
the subsequent ranking system.  Lipsey stressed that, based on the Gaiety’s score, it was 
not qualified to be a landmark.  She added that the BLC had previously had the 
opportunity to update this rating in 1989, with the creation of the Midtown Cultural 
District Plan, but that the Gaiety’s score of was upheld during this review (as were all 
other 1981 ratings).57 
 
The outcomes of petitions for other Blackall theaters was given for reference; in the case 
of the Wang, the Wilbur and the Modern, interior, interior/exterior and exterior landmark 
designations were assigned respectively.  However when the Gary and the Exeter 
Theaters had been considered, the Commissioners determined that though each was 
worthy of preservation, neither met “the stringent standards for potential designation,” 
and the petitions were denied. 57

Lipsey reminded the Commissioners that Landmark designation is the “highest honor and 
form of protection that can be afforded,” and that it must be reserved only for properties 
deemed to be architecturally or historically significant not only to Boston but also to the 
state, to New England or to the Nation.  Her final remarks included the following: 
 

“[The] Staff finds the architectural and historical evidence presented to date does not 
justify further consideration of the Gaiety Theater for Landmark designation.  In the 
history of the Commission, no petitions have been accepted for buildings rated IV or 
lower.  This determination is not an endorsement for the demolition of the Gaiety 
Theater.  The Commission does not support the loss of any historic building, [but] at 
the same time that it affirms that not all buildings qualify for designation as Boston 
Landmarks….”58 (emphasis added)  

  
As the overall tone of the “staff comments” suggested the coming denial of the petition, 
the outlook did not seem good for the Gaiety Theater.  Nevertheless, an invitation was 
extended for the submission of new information that might improve the theater’s 
perceived significance relative to Landmark Criteria.” 58  
 
 
November 26th, 2002.  Preliminary Hearing, Petition 207.02 – petition to designate 
the Gaiety Theater as a Boston Landmark.   
“The purpose of the preliminary hearing is to present to the Commission why a 
property or properties should be considered for designation….”59     
 
The purpose of the hearing was for the Commission to consider arguments for and 
against the petition to designate the interior and/or the exterior of the Gaiety; following 
the testimony, the commissioners would vote to determine whether or not the case would 
be accepted for further study.60

The four FOTG officers presented the first arguments for designation that evening.  They 
began by reiterating the reasons for designation cited on the petition and then presented 
short histories of the Gaiety and of the theater in Boston.  Eiseman then read statements 
from letters and articles that favored the proposed designation; Frank Cullen and Bob 
Kostarian attended the hearing to personally express their support61.   
 
Kiefer offered a rebuttal citing the same reasons that had been included in the staff 
comments prepared for the hearing.  As he had at the demo delay hearing, he noted that 
the building would be difficult to reuse; he additionally noted that the significant features 
had been altered or removed61.   
 
When the petition’s proponents again took the floor, Richard Candee, head of Boston 
University’s preservation program, urged the Commissioners to upgrade the Gaiety’s 
rating after Michael DeLacey (from the HRC) had noted that there was precedent for 
doing so.  Shirley Kressel argued that there was “ample time” to consider the petition, 
that it would not interfere with the proposed development given that final approval of the 
project was still a ways off61.   
 
Arguments against the designation followed from Susan Hartnett of the BRA and Esther 
Kaplan of the Office of Cultural Affairs.  Both women’s opposition was based on the 
claim that there was no need for a theater of the Gaiety’s size; the women may have been 
concerned that, given the amount of money a restoration would cost, Kensington would 
appeal a landmarks designation and ultimately win at a significant cost to the city in time 
and money spent in defense of the designation.62 Albert Rex from the BPA noted that he 
opposed designation but supported retention of the theater until the Kensington project 
had the green light61.  
                                                
 
61 Minutes, BLC meeting and public hearing, 11/26/2002 
62 The Landmarks enabling legislation states “Any person aggrieved by a designation of the commission … 
may… appeal the designation or determination to the superior court for Suffolk County.  Upon every 
such appeal, the court shall hear all pertinent evidence and, on the basis thereof, … if it finds the 
decision of the commission … to damage the owner of the property unreasonably in comparison to 
the benefit conferred on the public, shall annul the designation… in whole or in part….” (emphasis 
added) (MGL Chapter 772, Section 9. Appeals)

Following the testimony, Ellen Lipsey clarified the theater rating system and read the 
staff comments and conclusion that “in the matter of long-term public interest, the 
commission should reject the petition.”  But she added that if the theater’s rating were 
upgraded, it could be reconsidered63.   
 
Despite Lipsey’s suggestion, and the “vocal urging of City of Boston employees that 
designation was inappropriate and a study uncalled for,”64 the Commission voted 5 to 3 
in favor of the petition that evening and added the Gaiety Theater to the list of properties 
requiring the preparation of a study report63.65  
 
It is probably safe to say that the outcome of the hearing was a surprise to the petition’s 
opponents.  The BSA Historic Resources Committee later had this to say about the 
commission’s decision: 
 

“The vote was unusual in that it ran counter to the recommendations of BLC staff and the 
Boston Preservation Alliance, not to mention the BSA and SAH. Stay tuned…”66 
(emphasis added) 

 
In actuality, the recommendation from the SAH (Society of Architectural Historians) had 
not been received by the BLC in time to serve as testimony for the hearing on November

26th.67  The Society’s representative, David Fixler had eloquently offered the following 
comments for the BLC’s review: 
 

“The situation in which the Gaiety Theater finds itself is unfortunate, if not tragic… it is 
clear that at one time the Gaiety… was a very nice theater, of which little more than a 
hulk remains today….  
“Within the shell of the theater, the basic space and a smattering of the plaster 
ornament… is intact.  It is however in terrible shape and could conceivably cost $20-25 
million to put into proper usable condition.  Little if any of the remaining ornament could 
be salvaged and restored, and the entire project would essentially become a 
reconstruction….” (emphasis added) 

 
He continued: 
 

“Then the philosophical question arises – what are we preserving….  any ‘restoration’ of 
the Gaiety would in fact be a reconstruction, there is almost nothing that speaks to the 
integrity of the original beyond the concrete shell and a battered brick façade, and it is 
hard to make the case that this is a building of such great architectural or cultural value 
that it merits these exceptional measures.  As preservationists, we should understand that 
the sentiment and nostalgia that are driving the petitioners can be powerful tools to 
facilitate saving anything.  However, we must also be pragmatists, and recognize that to 
be effective, preservation must move beyond nostalgia to analysis and judgment based on 
(to the greatest degree possible) objective criteria.”68   

 
While one cannot say whether or not it would have affected the BLC’s decision to go 
ahead with the study report, it certainly would have served as another significant 
argument against such a step.   
 
 

 
                                                
67 Though the recommendation was written 11/26/2002, it was apparently not received at the BLC until 
December 10th.  One can only speculate as to whether this was intentional on the part of an author who 
perhaps did not wish his, largely subjective recommendation, to influence the Commissioners’ decision.

FOTG – 1: Opponents – 0 
 
Not everyone was pleased with the Commission’s decision.  Douglass Shand-Tucci, a 
historian of American art and architecture, wrote to the Landmarks Commission to 
express his amazement that anyone would attempt to “save” the theater.  After reminding 
the BLC that he had “pioneered the study of these theaters” for articles he wrote in the 
late 1970s, he declared, “… the Gaiety has very, very little [value].  It is not either 
architecturally or historically worth preservation… I write to declare my strong 
opposition to this ill-advised effort to keep the Gaiety.”69   
 
For the theater’s advocates, the vote was a major victory.  The demo delay, set to expire 
on December 9th, 2002, had effectively been postponed for several months while the BLC 
staff put together a study report.  This new delay would allow the preservationists more 
time to strengthen their case and to gain additional support for their cause.   
 
 
FOTG growth and other support 
 
In the months that followed their formation, the Friends of the Gaiety grew into a motley 
organization consisting of “committed volunteer architectural historians, architects, 
developers and devotees of Boston’s cultural patrimony.”70  They also enjoyed support 
from some members of the local acoustical community for the purportedly superb 
acoustics in the Gaiety and potential association with Wallace Sabine71.   
 
Many Gaiety Friends were members of Boston’s performing arts community who felt 
that that Boston’s need for performing space far exceeded the available supply, 
consequently they embraced the prospect of preserving the theater for use as another 
concert hall.  In January 2003, Leo Beranek, an acoustician and Sabine-biographer, wrote

to Mayor Menino to urge preservation of the Gaiety, calling it a theater “that is just right 
for the performance of music.” 
 

“Boston has a vital need, a hall for musical performances that has a seating capacity of 
1500 or so.  We are proud of our Boston Symphony Hall that seats 2600 and of Jordan 
Hall that seats about 1000.  Both halls are booked to capacity and one is large for many 
users and the other is too small.  The worst part of the story is that there are only a few 
dates during each concert season that are available in either outside of its own uses.   A 
number of us have been worried about how to meet this need and all suggestions to date 
have been for halls that would seat only 500 or so.  For organizations such as Handel and 
Haydn, and those that produce small operas, chamber music, small/medium orchestra and 
choral performances, there is no place to go.  We vitally need another venue.”72  

 
Beranek also urged the Mayor to assist “some coalition of local musical organizations 
and others” with finding the money to renovate the theater.  Whether or not he was 
referring to the Gaiety Friends at that point is unclear.  They were aiming to raise enough 
money from private sources to purchase, restore and endow the theater such that they 
could run it as a non-profit operation73.  Perhaps the Friends recognized that even if the 
Gaiety were landmarked, such an action would only require the developer to preserve the 
theater; it could in no way require Kensington to make the space available to the small-
budget community arts groups, musical organization and performance companies who 
supported the preservation effort.  
  
Of course, those against designation claimed that just the opposite was true regarding the 
need for performance space of this size.  At the petition hearing, Esther Kaplan of the 
Office of Cultural Affairs had noted that, though there was excess demand for both small 
and large theaters (200-800 and 3000+ seats, respectively), theaters the size of  the former 
Gaiety (~1500 after renovation) did not meet those needs and were not in demand 
themselves74.

Chinatown for preservation 
 
In general the more people who back your cause, the better – especially if those 
individuals are likely bloc voters and/or carry some degree of political clout.  So in 
February 2003, Friends of the Gaiety clerk Steve Jerome wrote an article for the 
Sampan75 in an effort to get Chinatown on board with saving the Gaiety.   
 
The article was bluntly titled “Gaiety Friends Need Chinatown,” and in it, Jerome 
appealed to the residents of Chinatown to join in the Friends’ campaign to preserve the 
theater.   
 
He reminded Sampan readers of “a call” in the MCDP for the creation of cultural spaces 
for the city’s nonprofit arts community and stated that it had explicitly recommended the 
conversion of the Gaiety and Pilgrim Theaters into such spaces. 
 
Though the Pilgrim has since been demolished, Jerome asserted that the Gaiety remained 
the “ideal candidate for a long overdue cultural and performing arts facility for 
Chinatown.”76  He added that it was imperative for the theater to receive landmark 
designation, to ensure it continued existence and, he hoped, eventual restoration. 
 
Some community advocates, such as Sherry Hao from the Campaign to Protect 
Chinatown, agreed with Jerome and joined the battle to Save the Gaiety77.  Others 
however, hungry for the additional units of affordable housing the Kensington 
development would bring, felt that the ultimate benefits of project would outweigh any 
historical loss78.  But despite the different opinions, Chinatown residents and

organizations in favor of preservation were far more vocal than those that were opposed 
and helped to bolster the case for the Gaiety.  
 
 
African American support 
 
In the 1920s, the Jazz Age was sweeping the nation.  Burlesque producers picked up on 
this new style and before long, shows with all black or integrated “casts” were being put 
together79.  These shows usually originated in Harlem and toured “an informal circuit” of 
theaters in Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Washington and occasionally Chicago and 
Pittsburgh80.  Though many of Boston’s theaters hosted such productions at one time or 
another, The Gaiety and the Casino were the only two to “regularly [present] African-
American performers.”81  
 
Some have cautioned that these integrated productions should not be interpreted as 
“enlightened race relations,”82 but rather just one of a number of attempts by the 
Columbia Circuit to stave off its impending decline: 
 

 “Cartoon comedies, melodrama, clean burlesque, dirty burlesque, Negro aggregations, 
mixed black and white troupes, vaudeville--Columbia tried them all in the last dying 
years. To no avail.”83   

 
But regardless of the reasons for there presentation, these shows afforded many talented 
black performers an opportunity to perform in an era where Jim Crow laws often 
prevented them from doing so84.

In February 2003, the FOTG had seized upon this to lobby for support from the black 
community. They co-sponsored an event with Harvard University’s W.E.B. DuBois 
Institute for Afro-American Research which presented a retrospective of the theater’s 
history and “a recreation – through the use of old recordings and video clips – of the 
excitement that African-American performers generated from The Gaiety’s stage.”85  The 
Friends also began referring to the theater as an African-American historic site, perhaps 
hoping to pressure the Mayor’s office into rethinking its stance against the proposed 
designation.  
 
 
The BLC Study Report – accepted March 14, 2003 
 
Pam Fox, an architectural historian, had been selected to compose the BLC Study Report 
for the Gaiety based on her involvement with the preparation of the Boston Theater 
District Survey as well as the Study Reports for several other Boston theaters.   
The information presented in the report came from BLC records, books on theater 
history, playbills, newspaper clippings, engineering reports and interviews with 
historians.  The report described the location, historical use and current condition of the 
structure.  It also depicted the theater’s significance with regard to architectural 
achievement, association with historic persona, and the histories of theater in Boston as 
well as of vaudeville and burlesque.  The theater’s relationship to the criteria for 
landmark designation was outlined and a description of how both the theater and the 
proposed development fit into the underlying Plans and Zoning was given.  After a 
presentation of the options available to the BLC (including Landmark Designation, 
National Register Listing, and a Memorandum of Agreement) and the foreseen impacts 
of those alternatives, the report recommended how to proceed with this landmarks case.86   
 
As the report had concluded that the Gaiety Theater did not meet any one of the four 
criteria for landmark status, it recommended against designating the Gaiety.  Instead, it

suggested the “execution of a Memorandum of Agreement between the developer and the 
Massachusetts Historical Commission, with the Boston Landmarks Commission as a 
concurring party….”87  Of course, a MOA was already in the works between Kensington 
and the MHC. 
 
 
The FOTG counter report 
 
As the BLC Study Report and its recommendations did not bode well for the Gaiety, the 
FOTG were not about to let it be the final word governing the theater’s fate.  They 
immediately took action by composing their own report, “The Gaiety 
Theatre: A Historic Boston Landmark” to provide, in their words, “a more balanced view 
without regard to political or commercial pressures.”88  Their study presented additional 
information regarding the significance of the structure; it also included a case for how the 
Gaiety actually did meet three of the four criteria for landmark status, a point-by-point 
rebuttal of what they considered to be “the most egregious errors of the [BLC] Study 
Report”89, and an attack on the Kensington project. 
 
The report included the results from the acoustical studies conducted by Griesinger and, 
again, stressed the likelihood of Sabine’s involvement with the theater.  There was a 
lengthy section discussing the Gaiety’s social significance and a description of the 
architectural significance with regard to fireproofing and building technology.

Architectural Significance   
 
In 1885, it became mandatory for theaters in Boston to be constructed of fireproof 
materials and to have proper routes of egress90.  As such, the BLC Study Report 
dismissed claims that the Gaiety’s fireproofing was architecturally innovative by stating 
that fireproof construction was not novel.  Though this is true, the counter report stressed 
that the Gaiety was the "first playhouse to be completed and operated under the rigid 
[newly revised] building laws of 1907.”91  When the theater opened, newspapers 
advertisements noted that the concrete floors and roof deck were reinforced to prevent 
against collapse, that structural steel clad in masonry, and wood was used sparingly – 
only for the stage floor and for limited trim elements92.  Blackall had been the primary 
author of the fire-prevention and safety portions of the new building codes and is said to 
have designed the Gaiety to demonstrate the application of these new codes93.     
 
When it opened, the theater had also received praise for the site lines – each seat had an 
unobstructed view to the stage thanks to the use of massive I-beams that allowed the 
balconies to be cantilevered into the auditorium foregoing the need for columnar 
support94.  And while Boston’s Jordan Hall (1903) has been cited as an earlier example of 
such a structural accomplishment, the FOTG stated that the technologies were, in fact 
different.  As reported by structural engineer John Coote,   
 

“The balcony at Jordan Hall [22-foot, seven-row deep] is an unremarkable and modest 
design, consisting of cantilevered steel reuses supported on a row of columns situated at 
the rear of the Auditorium….  The Blackall design for The Gaiety was much more 
structurally daring. The conventional columns were replaced by long span steel girders 
which spanned the whole width of the Auditorium. This allowed for very much deeper

balconies to be constructed [49-foot, 17-row deep] while maintaining seating areas which 
are column-free.”95  

 
At the time of construction, the beams, which measured 54” x 12” in section and spanned 
the 57’ width of the theater, were the largest in the city96.      
 
 
“To express my support …” 
 
In the days leading up to and immediately following the designation hearing the BLC 
received many letters regarding the (now very controversial) case of the Gaiety’s fate.  
Letters were also sent to the Boston’s Mayor Menino given that, even if the 
Commissioners voted for designation, he would still have to sign off on it in order for it 
to be conferred.   
 
Writing in favor of preservation were those who felt the theater should be saved for its 
feats of structural engineering or the role it played in Boston’s evolving fire codes97.  
Others thought that its acoustics, described as “ideal for listening to unamplified sound”98 
and/or its purported relationship with Sabine warranted its preservation99.  There were 
those who wanted to see the “important cultural resource within the Midtown Cultural 
District”100 restored and used as a cultural space101 or as a performance venue for both the 
local community102 and for performance groups98.  Carl Zellner, a founding member of 
the Landmarks Commission in 1975, had read the FOTG report and believed that the 
Gaiety deserved to “be restored to its original glory.”  Stating that the theater had 
important historical significance as a “people’s house” -- a theater for the working class --

he wrote in support of landmark designation103.  Boston City Councilors John Tobin and 
Michael Ross noted the theater’s “significant contributions to twentieth century jazz and 
vaudeville acts in Boston, particularly with its integrated casts.”104  
 
Michael DeLacey, a member of the BPA who had urged the Alliance to support the 
FOTG’s “grassroots movement,”105 stated that the evidence supporting preservation had 
already been laid out in the BLC’s own Study report, which he described as “rather 
compelling in favor of designation.”106 (emphasis added) 
 
Gaiety Friend Raffi Berberian wrote to elucidate the position from which the FOTG 
counter report had been written: 
 

“The Friends of the Gaiety Theater is not an assembly of fanatical anti-development 
historic preservationists.  The Friends’ immediate objective is to help save The Gaiety by 
making known to the Landmarks Commissioners the crucial criteria that make 
preservation of this property imperative.  Although some members are amateurs in the 
field, they are demonstrating admirable competence in enlisting the judgments of 
professionals, undertaking historical research, publicizing the story of The Gaiety, and 
preparing reports and rebuttals to present to the Commission the compelling case for 
designation.  I believe the caliber of their campaign before the Boston Landmarks 
Commission is unprecedented.  As The Friends’ submissions will demonstrate, the 
architectural and historical significance of The Gaiety demands this level of attention.”107    

 
Some individuals simply opined that over the years, there had already been enough 
“destruction of the cultural heritage in America”108, that enough theaters had already been 
torn down to make way for “shopping mall parking lots, office complexes, and luxury

condominiums.”109  The value of landmarking the Gaiety, they believed, would be 
realized for generations to come110.   
 
 
“To express my opposition…” -- The other side of the coin… 
 
At the other end of the spectrum were the voices opposed to landmark designation; and 
unfortunately for the Gaiety, some of those voices were rather noteworthy.   
 
PreservatiON Mass (a statewide preservation organization) after reviewing the Study 
Report prepared by the BLC, wrote, “Regretfully, after a great deal of consideration, we 
feel that the Gaiety Theater does not meet criteria for Boston Landmark designation.”111 
The BPA, whose members had read the BLC report as well as information provided by 
the FOTG, reached the same decision – “regretfully” and “after much discussion,” the 
building did not meet the criteria112.  Both the BPA and PreservatiON Mass noted the 
prestige of Boston Landmark designation and stated that it applies only to buildings that 
rise above local significance. Both groups avowed (with virtually identical language) 
that their decisions were neither to be “construed as a condemnation of the theater for not 
having sufficient (architectural or) historic qualifications,” nor interpreted as an 
“endorsement of the Kensington Place project.”111,112  
 
Cara Metz, on behalf of the MHC, acknowledged the popular arguments in favor of 
preservation but countered with the following: 
 

“As such, the theater is an interesting, but not outstanding, example of a purpose-built 
burlesque theater constructed to the requirements of stricter building codes of the era and 
its comparatively minimal decorative interior is reflective of the financial realities of 
theater operators in much of the entertainment business of the day….

“When evaluating historic properties, however, both historic association and architecture 
must be considered.  While the historic associations of the Gaiety Theater are indeed 
important, the building itself has lost most of its architectural significance…. 
“In consideration of the information contained in the Landmark Study Report, the MHC 
concurs with the [BLC] staff recommendation that the Gaiety Theater is not an 
outstanding work of Boston architect Clarence H. Blackall, and does not appear to meet 
the criteria for Boston Landmark designation.”113  

 
It was noted by Boston resident and former BLC Chairman Alan Schwartz that “Unlike 
previously designated theaters and other sites… the Gaiety has unfortunately lost most of 
its architectural integrity” who concurred with the Study Report’s conclusion that the 
Gaiety Theater “[Did] not meet the high standards for Landmark designation as found in 
Chapter 772.”114  
 
Citizen W. Kevin Fitzgerald, a self-described “firm believer in the Midtown Cultural 
District,” shared his belief that the Gaiety was one of many theaters in the district that 
had become antiquated and unsuited for reuse due to health and safety concerns.  
Fitzgerald avowed that if reuse were a possibility, it would have already happened, but 
recognized that the opposing side might think otherwise, saying “Somehow, we 
Bostonians have a more difficult time in recognizing that buildings cannot be reused.”  
After noting his experience with the restoration and renovation of several structures in 
Boston, Fitzgerald concluded, “My sensitivity is acute, my interest sincere and my 
pragmatism very real and I hope that you will reject the petition.”115

April 8, 2003 – Gaiety Theater Designation Hearing 
 
An unusually large crowd was gathered in Room 900 in Boston’s City Hall when the 
meeting was called to order that evening116. In addition to the BLC commissioners and 
staff, the room was filled with individuals (and their supporters) who would be testifying 
for or against designation.   
 
Following a summary presentation of the Study Report’s findings and recommendations, 
the testimony began.  The Commissioners first heard statements from elected officials 
and their representatives.  Next came statements from the Massachusetts Historical 
Commission and the Boston Redevelopment Authority, two agencies with review 
authority under the BLC enabling legislation (the Landmark’s Act).  Those in favor of 
designation then took the floor, presenting statements and evidence; those opposed 
followed suit117.   
 
That evening, Stuart Rosenberg, a representative for Boston City Counselors Ross and 
Tobin, representatives of Chinatown advocacy groups, representatives from cultural and 
performing groups, representatives of the Friends of the Gaiety Theater, including Jack 
Little and Shirley Kressel, Steve Landrigan, Michael DeLacey and several other Boston 
residents and activists repeated their arguments in support of designation.  At the hearing, 
the Friends of the Gaiety officially submitted their counter study report as testimony117.  
 
Those testifying in opposition were representatives from the Massachusetts Historical 
Commission, the Boston Preservation Alliance, Historic Boston Inc., the Boston Society 
of Architects, Ralph Cole from Kensington Investment Company, representatives of 
Chinatown advocacy groups, Susan Hartnett from the BRA, Lance Olsen, the manager of 
the Emerson Majestic Theater and Ester Kaplan, Office of Cultural Affairs117.

After acknowledged the letters to the BLC regarding this matter both sides had a chance 
to rebut.  A deadline for the submission of additional written testimony was given as 
April 11th, and the vote for designation was scheduled for the later that month118.   
 
 
April 22, 2003 - The vote 
“Tonight you must consider designation apart from everything but the Commission's 
enabling legislation, its regulations and by-laws – apart from… the proposed 
Kensington project…, apart from the compelling pleas that this building should be 
preserved and reused as a theater for live entertainment.  Your main action tonight is 
to vote whether or not the Gaiety Theater should be designated as a Boston 
Landmark.”119   
 
When the discussion and vote on whether to designate the Gaiety Theater as a Boston 
Landmark came about that evening, the commissioners had had two weeks to consider 
the evidence presented at the public hearing, five weeks to consider the BLC Study 
Report, and five months to consider the petition.  As the discussion began, the prepared 
staff comments were read, perhaps foreshadowing the theater’s fate:   
 

"The criteria for designation have remained high.  To date the commission has 
designated 79 individual Landmarks including portions of 17 interiors….  All but one 
interior designated, had more intact building fabric, furnishings and/or finishes at the 
time of designation than the Gaiety has now."  
 
“Along with the interiors of the Wilbur, Wang, Keith Memorial, Paramount, and 
Emerson Majestic the designation of a sixth theater interior, the Colonial is pending.  
The Wilbur, Wang, and Colonial are Blackall designs and are cited as among Blackall’s 
greatest accomplishments….  The BLC's survey listed the Gaiety as a candid for 
preservation and reuse, but not designation."

“The issue of what’s left to preserve, in terms of significant building fabric, is ultimately 
at the heart of the Gaiety Landmark designation issue.  The tool of Landmarking for 
protection is inextricably tied to preserving existing physical fabric regardless of whether 
the building is significant historically or architecturally, or both.   
 
“To sum up, the question before you tonight it not whether the Gaiety deserves to be 
preserved or reused as a theater.  It is whether the Gaiety Theater as it stands today, has 
enough historical and/or architectural significance combined with enough remaining 
physical fabric at this time (related to significance), to meet the rigorous standards for 
Landmark designation….”120

 
The ensuing discussion addressed the relationship of the Gaiety to the criteria for 
landmark designation.   
a) 
It was noted that the Gaiety was not presently listed on the National Register 
b)  With regard to the social, political, economic or cultural history of the city, the commonwealth, 
the New England region, or the nation, the Gaiety was not found to meet the level of significance 
required for designation. 
c)  With regard the proposal that the structure should be landmarked for epitomizing simplistic, 
practical design, it was determined that in the case of the Gaiety, there was not enough original 
material intact to be grounds for landmark designation.   
As this third point was further discussed, the Commissioners stressed that landmarking 
the theater interior would require its replication and reconstruction rather than its 
restoration120. 
 
Following their discussion, the BLC made a motion to recommend a MOA very similar 
to the one suggested in their study report, but with the notable additional stipulation that 
Kensington should provide a written confirmation that the Gaiety would remain standing 
until “all permits required for construction have been issued.”  This motion was passed 
with a vote of 9-0.  The landmark petition itself was never brought to a vote121.

One week later, the Commission sent out a formal memo to “Petitioners and other 
interested parties” describing their decision not to vote.  The petitioners were thanked for 
their efforts and for their contributions to the “BLC’s high standard of review….”  The 
BLC acknowledged that the theater was worthy of preservation, but not landmark status.  
And like the MHC and BPA before them, they avowed that their decision not to designate 
should not be construed as an endorsement of the Kensington project122.  But as the BLC 
is part of the BRA and the BRA was very supportive of this development, it is likely that 
very few supporters of the Gaiety Theater believed them….   
 
 
“All major approvals…” 
 
In advance of the designation decision, activist Shirley Kressel had written to the BLC to 
request that if designation was assigned the Commission would urge Kensington to sign a 
“legally enforceable commitment” giving assurance that they would not demolish the 
theater until all construction permits for their project had been issued123.  Kensington had 
made a verbal promise at least once before, but as the demo delay had expired four 
months prior, Kressel presumably worried that the pending landmark case was the only 
thing standing between the Gaiety and the wrecking ball.  As Kensington's development 
goals are counter to the development goals she and her organization have for Boston, she 
clearly wanted to prevent Kensington from turning the location into an empty lot where, 
even were the pending proposal ultimately overturned, there would be less leverage with 
which to negotiate for concessions to local citizen concerns on an alternative proposal.

Save the Gaiety, Stop development! 
 
With the BLC’s decision, the path of saving the theater via landmark designation was 
abruptly cut off.  But the fight to prevent Kensington from tearing down the Gaiety to 
make way for their development was far from over.  On the contrary, this battle would 
rage on for two more years.   
 
Concerns had been raised about the Kensington project from the moment it was first 
proposed; many revolved around the fate of the Gaiety Theater.  But at the same time, 
other questions were raised, especially the way in which the development would relate to 
the Midtown Cultural District Plan and the ramifications the development was likely to 
have on Chinatown.   
 
 
Height fright 
 
Three days after filing the Project Notification Form (PNF) with the BRA, 
representatives of Kensington Investment Company met with the Park Plaza Civic 
Advisory Committee to review the proposal.124   
 
The primary concern that evolved from that meeting was with regard to how well the 
project would relate to the area’s existing architecture; in particular (as is often the case 
with proposed development in Boston125), the committee expressed concern over the 
planned height.  Noting that both the Midtown Cultural District Plan and the Chinatown 
Master Plan recommend for development in scale with the existing urban fabric of the 

 
                                                
124 All proposals for development in Boston must undergo review by the BRA; larger projects additionally 
require review by city-appointed Civic Advisory Committees (CACs) which are “obligated to perform a 
major advisory role in all stages of the planning, renewal and redevelopment of the [committee specific] 
Urban Renewal Area and to communicate regularly with the BRA on matters of community concern 
relating to it.”  In the Park Plaza Urban Renewal Area, the future site of the Kensington Place project, 
this review is provided by the Park Plaza CAC. (BZC, Article 80; The Boston Herald, 11/30/2001; Letter 
from the Park Plaza Civic Advisory Committee to the BRA, 12/27/2001)

neighborhoods (primarily 10 stories or less), the Park Plaza CAC expressed their belief 
that this guideline “should be respected and followed.”126  
 
Other committees and individuals shared their opinion.  Among the remarks submitted by 
Boston’s Environmental Department for the project’s Scoping Determination was a note 
that the Landmarks staff had found “the height of the proposed buildings and massing 
along Washington Street out of scale and character for the area.”  They suggested that 
shifting the massing of the tower along LaGrange Street and including a height setback 
along Washington Street would help to resolve the issue.127  
 
 
PDA problems 
 
As the Park Plaza CAC had pointed out, the underlying zoning in the Midtown Cultural 
District (MCD) is for low-rise structures.  Fortunately for Kensington, their project site 
was located within Planned Development Area IV (PDA-IV) of the MCD128.  As such, 
Kensington could seek a PDA Overlay District designation, which would raise the height 
limit to 275 feet for construction that is part of a PDA Development Plan; arguments 
against the legality of the proposed height would therefore be dismissed.   
 

 
                                                
126 Letter from the Park Plaza Civic Advisory Committee to the BRA, 12/27/2001 
127 In January 2002, other letters for the Scoping Determination expressing similar concerns over the scale 
of the Kensington Place project were received from representatives of the Asian Community 
Development Corporation, the Bay Village Neighborhood Association, the Campaign to Protect 
Chinatown, the Chinese Progressive Association and Boston resident Douglas Fiebelkorn.   
128 The MCD established four such areas.  “The purposes for establishment of the areas within which PDAs 
may be permitted are: to establish a more flexible zoning law and encourage large-scale private 
development on underutilized sites in the Midtown Cultural District while insuring quality design by 
providing planning and design controls; to protect and rehabilitate Boston's historic entertainment center 
as its cultural district, and to achieve the plan for the area as a vibrant regional arts district; to preserve 
and create the facilities necessary to house and showcase the resident artists and non-profit arts groups; 
to create new day care facilities; to protect and provide for expansion of housing and community 
facilities for the Chinatown community; to create public gathering places that will enliven and 
complement the historic buildings and streets which the Hinge Block comprises; and to preserve and 
protect the historic resources of Midtown.” (BZC, Section 38-10) 

 

35

The concern many people raised with regard to the Kensington’s PDA was the way in 
which the developer had drawn the boundaries.  Since their project site alone was not 
large enough to meet the one-acre minimum requirement129, it was proposed that a 
portion of the adjacent China Trade Center be included in the development area.  The 
complication with that was that the owner of the China Trade Center was the BRA.  For 
one thing, it did not seem right that a public organization should be assisting a private 
business with a controversial project.  Many opponents of the BRA had, for years 
considered them to be in cahoots with developers, often at the expense of the “little guy,” 
and this was only reinforcing that belief130.  Indeed, even the PNF listed as a projected 
public benefits: “Furthering the BRA’s planning objectives to redevelop lower 
Washington Street….”131  There was also the worry that if this sort of dealing was 
allowed to occur, it would set a precedent for other developers to attempt the same thing, 
and ultimately the zoning code would be rendered meaningless132.   
 
 
Parcel D and the Glass Slipper 
 
Following their initial review, the Park Plaza CAC had also questioned whether or not the 
entire project site was actually located within the Park Plaza Urban Renewal 
Area (PPURP).  In particular, they questioned the status of Parcels D and E.  The PPURP 
states, in part “Unless the Authority shall have selected a developer for Parcels D ad E 
within three years from the date of approval of this plan [1971], Parcels D and E shall no 
longer be considered part of the Park Plaza Project Area,”133 and though an amendment 
to the PPURP that the BRA passed in 1981 deleted the three year expiration date for the 
two parcels, the statutory timeframe had elapsed leaving the validity of the action in

doubt134.  This was a problem because, as Kensington reported in their PNF, “assistance 
from the BRA pursuant to its Park Plaza Plan eminent domain authority may be required 
to assemble all of the parcels that will ultimately comprise the site.”  Though Parcel D 
was part of the proposal, Kensington did not own it; if not included in the urban renewal 
area, the BRA would not have the jurisdiction to take this land via eminent domain135.   
 
Parcel D and the remainder of the Kensington Place project site is within the only area 
zoned for adult entertainment uses in Boston.  In the late 1970s, the adult entertainment 
industry was thriving; there were scores of sex-related businesses in the “Zone” including 
strip clubs, peep shows, adult bookstores, sex shops and porn movie houses136.  But by 
the mid 1980s, pressures from City Hall, the adjacent community of Chinatown, and even 
the rise of home video, had resulted in a sharp decline in the market for such 
entertainment137.  New development just outside the Zone hurt the adult businesses even 
more as it resulted in increased property values and, consequently, higher rents138.   
 
Nevertheless, still concerned that market forces alone would fail to price out the adult 
entertainment providers, then-Mayor Flynn took over, enlisting the help of the property 
owners and having the city buy up property to prevent new adult businesses from 
opening139.  The Boston Licensing Board did its part by making it more and more 
difficult for the not-so-respectable businesses to keep their liquor licenses140.     
 
The Glass Slipper had weathered it all.  Though the demise of the club had seemed 
certain in 1989 when the Boston Licensing Board revoked the club’s liquor license, upon 
appeal to the state’s Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, the revocation was

converted to a 10-day suspension, granting the Slipper a reprieve.141  And much to the 
annoyance of the City and the residents of Chinatown, the Slipper’s business continued to 
boom142.  The market for adult entertainment would not go away; in fact, it was strong 
enough so that when a second strip club, Centerfolds, opened across the street from the 
Glass Slipper in late 2001, both clubs easily stayed in business143.   
 
As 2001 drew to a close, the Glass Slipper was comfortably situated right where it always 
had been, at 15 LaGrange Street.  But the club was about to encounter a problem – 15 
LaGrange was in Parcel D.   
 
One can imagine that the club’s owners Nicholas Romano and William Bennett were not 
too pleased with the prospect of having their property seized via eminent domain.  
Legally, the BRA would be required to pay for the club’s moving expenses and to help 
the club relocate to a new venue, but there were limited relocation alternatives within 
Boston’s existing adult entertainment district. Granted, if no space could be found in the 
former Zone, the Glass Slipper’s owners could sue to open elsewhere in the City, and it is 
presumed that they would win, as case law affirms the city is legally required to provide 
areas for adult entertainment.  Nevertheless, Romano and Bennett liked their location and 
did not want to be forced to move144. Furthermore, the City would not be required to 
indefinitely subsidize any reduction in business at a new location, and it wasn’t entirely 
certain that the BRA could legally seize their property.  The Glass Slipper was not about 
to go without a fight.

“transparent purpose” of the revocation had been to clear the adult entertainment district for 
redevelopment. (The Boston Globe, 9/1/1989)

Chinatown 
“Boston’s Chinatown was established between 1869 and 1870 when the completion of 
the Transcontinental Railroad brought Chinese railroad workers to manufacturing 
jobs in Boston and other parts of the Northeast….  Chinatown grew slowly over a 
hundred and thirty years… to a 46-acre neighborhood that is one of the last ethnic 
communities in the city of Boston.”145
 
Despite substantial and continuing growth in population and pressures for further 
expansion, Chinatown began to shrink in the late 1950’s when the borders were 
constricted and 200-300 families were displaced by the construction of the Southeast 
Expressway/Central Artery and the Mass Turnpike.  Over the years, from it’s mid-50’s 
peak, Chinatown lost one third of its housing and fifty percent of its land area to urban 
renewal projects.  Nevertheless the community’s population continued to grow144; in the 
1980s, as the Combat Zone began its decline, businesses that serve the neighborhood 
began to spill into the former Zone146.  But by the late 80s, developments within and near 
the Zone were beginning to put upward pressures on the cost of living within Chinatown 
itself147.  As such, residents have become increasingly interested in having their voices 
heard when it comes to development in the Zone148. 
 
Many residents of Chinatown had spoken out against the demolition of the Gaiety 
Theater as they had hoped it could instead be reused as performance venue for their 
community149.  More than a decade after the MCDP had called for cultural space, this 
goal was still unfulfilled.   
 
However, of even greater worry to Chinatown’s activists and residents was what 
Kensington was proposing to put in the Gaiety’s place.  Members of the PPCAC and 
several Chinatown advocacy groups expressed grave concern over the impacts that yet

another upscale development would have on the current local population – particularly 
with regard to the projected increase in the cost of housing as gentrification spreads 
closer to and even into Chinatown150.  
 
 
Project approvals 
 
The DPIR for the Kensington project151, incorporated several concessions aimed at 
addressing some of the noted concerns.  The new proposal included the height setbacks 
recommended by the BLC and Dean Johnson, a consultant to the Park Plaza Civic 
Advisory Committee (PPCAC)152 to help it better relate to the surrounding structures 
when viewed from the street.  The four-level, above ground parking garage, had been 
moved below ground.  Additionally, to mediate the worry that the project would 
ultimately price out the local residents, the number of affordable units was increased to 
15%153; this number would later be increased once again to a remarkable 17%154.   
 
The feasibility studies requested by the PPCAC and the BLC had been done.  Perhaps not 
surprisingly, Kensington’s consultants determined that reuse of the historic structures on 
the site was not a realistically feasible.  For the DPIR, the consultants noted that, although 
it would technically be possible to incorporate the theater and office building into new 
development, the amount of work necessary to bring the old structure up to modern day 
seismic and fire building codes would make the cost prohibitive (it would need to be 
entirely gutted and reduced to its shell in order for it to be properly reinforced).  The 
option of performing a “façadectomy” – in which only the Washington Street face of the 
structure would be preserved – was ruled out as it was not a “generally accepted 
treatment of historic properties.”153

It is perhaps interesting to note that this section of the DPIR also includes a statement 
that, early in the approvals process, Kensington, members of the BLC staff, and 
representatives of the MHC conceded that retention of the Gaiety Theater would preclude 
the proposed development.  Whether this knowledge was later reflected in the tone of the 
Gaiety’s Study Report or in the subsequent landmark hearing is unknown.  Certainly, it 
has been suggested155,156 that, as the BLC is not independent of the BRA157, the 
Landmarks Commission tries not to hinder projects that have the BRA’s support.   
 
Shirley Kressel declared in a letter to the BLC after the landmarks hearing, “It is no 
secret that the BRA works on behalf of developers; indeed this is the core founding 
mission of redevelopment authorities….  The simple fact is that the BLC is under 
pressures by a Mayor with a long-standing publicly known commitment to the 
Kensington project.”155 
 
Undoubtedly, for those who speculated that the BLC succumbed to pressure from the 
mayor and the BRA, and consequently to the whims of the developers who contributed to 
the mayor’s campaigns158, the failure to bring the Gaiety’s case to a vote at the landmark 
hearing only worsened their suspicions156.   
 
 
The MOA 
 
The BLC could not require that Kensington include in its MOA a promise to obtain all 
permits for its development before demolishing the Gaiety159.  Nevertheless, three days 
after the landmarks hearing, Kiefer wrote to the BLC confirming that Kensington would 
not demolish until it obtained “all major discretionary approvals necessary for the

Residences at Kensington Place project to proceed.”  He also added that the developer 
planned to include a similar proviso in its agreement with the MHC160.   
 
Sure enough, five months later the promise was legally made official as a part of the 
MOA between Kensington and the MHC.  The agreement also stipulated that in order to 
mitigate the loss of the historic structure, Kensington was required to properly document 
the theater before demolition, to incorporate into their development a public exhibit that 
highlighted the historical importance of the Gaiety, and to salvage important artifacts 
from the theater for use in that exhibit.  Additionally, it stated that the project would be 
subject to periodic design review by the MHC and the BLC, though this was more of a 
formality, given that neither organization would object to the project provided that no 
alternations were made to the plans that had been proposed in the Final Project Impact 
Report (FPIR)161,162.  
 
Of course, by this time, Kensington was already well on its way to getting all of the said 
“major discretionary approvals” necessary for its project.  On the same day as the MOA 
was made official, a public hearing was held to consider the proposals for the PDA 
Overlay District and the Development Plan for said PDA that were required for the 
project to proceed.  Despite statements from members of the Park Plaza CAC, from 
Chinatown advocates, from FOTG member Steve Jerome and from City Councilor Maura 
Hennigan against the development, the BRA voted in Kensington’s favor on every 
issue.163

163 At the hearing, the BRA voted to authorize its Director to issue any and all agreements and documents 
appropriate and necessary for the project (including a Final Adequacy Determination, a Certification of 
Compliance, a Certificate of Consistency and a Cooperation Agreement).  The Authority also voted to 
approve the proposed Development Plan finding, in part, that it was allowable by and complied with any 
provisions of the underlying zoning regulations, and that, once the area had been zoned as a PDA 
overlay district, the plan would meet the standards required for approval as per the Boston Zoning Code.  
Finally, the director was authorized to petition the Boston Zoning Commission to incorporate the 
proposed PDA into the Midtown Cultural District zoning map and to approve the Development Plan for 
said PDA. (BRA certificate of vote, 9/11/2003) 

 

42

 
That same evening, the BRA approved a modification to the Park Plaza Urban Renewal 
Area, “with respect to Parcel D.”  The passage of this modification put an end to any 
debate regarding whether or not Parcel D was in the urban renewal area; but more 
importantly, it adjusted the description of properties that the BRA could seize.  The BRA 
could now fulfill its half of the Cooperation Agreement it had been negotiating with 
Kensington since 2001 – it could seize the Glass Slipper for the Kensington project if its 
owners refused to sell164.  
 
The approvals may have been facilitated by the fact that, since the submission of the 
DPIR, the developer had better addressed the issue of the area they would seek to have 
designated as a PDA.  As more than one eyebrow had been raised regarding the proposed 
inclusion of land owned by the BRA, Kensington instead entered into an agreement with 
the Boston Young Men’s Christian Union according to which the BYMCU would allow a 
portion of its site to be incorporated into the proposed PDA overlay district165.  Still shy 
of the one-acre requirement, the developer proposed to include portions of the adjacent 
public streets and sidewalks to bring the area up to the minimum.  Project opponents 
“cried foul”166, and argued that the developer had been coached by the BRA into using 
this trick; others flat out questioned its legality167.  Though BRA spokeswoman Susan 
Elsbree claimed there was precedent for “counting streets” toward the one-acre 
requirement, when questioned by a columnist, she could not provide any examples168.   
Regardless, the inclusion was not successfully challenged.

Sprinkler problem 
 
Though Kensington had promised to wait for certain approvals before demolishing the 
building, preservationists and activists were worried that the developer would bring about 
demolition simply by neglecting the property to the extent it would be forced to proceed 
for safety reasons.  Indeed, Kensington had not put much, if any, money towards 
improvements since purchasing the building in 1986, and a lack of maintenance had 
resulted in widespread water damage inside the theater.  Their goal may have been to 
facilitate redevelopment by turning their property into a blight (as some critics 
accused169; but, having purchased the property “to hold for development,”170 it simply 
may have been that Kensington did not want to spend any money on a structure they had 
always planned to demolish.   
 
The Boston Fire Department was not happy with the fact that this lack of upkeep 
included a failure to ever install an automatic sprinkler system in the building.  Though 
the theater was the epitome of fireproof technology in 1908, nearly a century later, it was 
far from up to code; should the structure catch fire, the fire department was concerned for 
its own safety.  As such, in October 2003, the Boston Fire Department issued an 
Abatement Order mandating the installation of an automatic sprinkler system.  But the 
order included a caveat – the sprinklers would not be necessary if demolition occurred in 
a timely manner.  Kensington quickly reached an agreement with BFD to demolish the 
structure as soon as all approvals had been granted, setting a tentative deadline of March 
31, 2004171.  Though the agreement allowed, penalty-free, for the creation of a new 
deadline should the original not be met, it established a legal reason why the Gaiety 
should be demolished sooner rather than later.   
 
March 31st came and went, and the Gaiety was still standing; but Kensington was very 
close to obtaining all of the major discretionary approvals necessary for its project to

proceed.  When the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development 
(MDHCD) signed off on the Park Plaza Urban Renewal Plan Modification a month later, 
the approvals required by the MOA were complete.172  Theoretically, demolition of the 
Gaiety could now begin. 
 
 
Has demo begun? 
 
Perhaps in anticipation of the MDHCD’s approval, in early April 2004, Kensington hired 
contractors to drain the water from the basement and to begin removing certain interior 
materials from the building.  Immediately, opponents of the Gaiety’s demise raised the 
alarm173.   
 
FOTG president John Little, members of the Boston City Council, and Shirley Kressel 
wrote to the MHC, the BRA and the BLC to call attention to the fact that that 
Kensington, without all of the approvals, might be in violation of the MOA174.  
 
Kressel was also concerned with the manner in which Matthew Kiefer, Kensington’s 
lawyer, was seeking to define what approvals the MOA required.  Kiefer considered 
“major discretionary approvals” to be those which involved a complete review of the 
project, including considerable public participation, and for which the issuing authorities 
had “wide latitude… in deciding whether to approve the application.”175  As per this 
definition, lack of a building permit would not prevent demolition.  Hoping to address 
this issue, Kressel asked for both the BLC and the MHC to require Kensington to confirm 
in writing, “that no further steps toward demolition [would] be taken until a full and final 
building permit is issued for the project."176

The Park Plaza CAC made a similar request in a letter to the MHC.  After noting their 
concern that “demolition of a historic asset be prevented until after it is certain that 
redevelopment of the site is feasible – both legally and economically,” they detailed the 
approvals necessary for the issuance of demo permit as per their understanding of the 
MOA.  “Building Permit” preceded “Demolition permit’ on their list177.  
 
But these requests would not be granted; on the last day of April, the MHC received a 
letter from Kiefer to document that all of major discretionary approvals had been 
received and the requirement was complete178.   
 
 
Article 38 
 
Kensington had not been in violation of the MOA when it began dewatering the basement 
and removing the asbestos.  These steps were part of required pre-demolition work that 
must be done before the City of Boston’s Inspectional Services Department (ISD) will 
issue a permit for demolition.  The pre-demo work for the Gaiety theater was a bit 
complicated as, in addition to the usual cutting and capping of utilities, it involved the 
abatement of hazardous materials (asbestos) and the careful removal of the artifacts 
Kensington’s consultants had selected to include in the public interpretive exhibit.  While 
the pre-demo work progressed, project opponents kept watch.  They also took up the 
legal argument as to why the Gaiety could not be demolished179.   
 
Article 38 of the Boston Zoning Code was created to establish the zoning regulations 
associated with the Midtown Cultural District Plan.  Gaiety supporters seized upon 
section 38-21.2 of the Code, stating that it prohibits demolition of a theater; they argued 
that as the Gaiety was a theater, issuing a demo permit for the structure would violate the

Code180.  Kressel added that Article 38 gave special protection to theaters – rendering 
them subject to neither the BLC’s “jurisdiction nor expertise” – in other words, even 
though the BLC had not assigned landmark designation to the Gaiety, that did not equate 
to permission to raze the structure. 
 
But as Kensington’s lawyer was quick to point out, the building had not been zoned for 
use as a theater at the time the MCD Plan was adopted.  In 1988, the legal occupancy of 
had been temporarily changed to: food storage, stores, offices, restaurant, bookstore181.  
The MCD Plan took effect the following year.  Furthermore, Kiefer argued, the Gaiety 
did not meet the definition of “theater” as explained in Article 38: “’Theater” means a 
facility equipped for the production and presentation of performing and visual arts 
events.”182  In 2003, an architectural firm had determined that the Gaiety, in its current 
state, was not suitable for such use; and to be rendered suitable would require the 
building’s footprint to be expanded.  As such, Kiefer averred that the former Gaiety was 
not subject to Section 38-21.2183.  But project opponents fought on. 
 
As the Article 38 arguments and letters continued, so too did the pre-demo work on the 
Gaiety.  Project opponents succeeded in interrupting the work once in September 2004, 
when, in response to a concern raised regarding the removal of windows and roofing 
material from the building, the ISD issued a temporary Stop Work Order to investigate 
why this had occurred.  Kressel had argued that such work was outside the parameters of 
the pre-demo asbestos removal permit as it rendered the building susceptible to the 
elements.  If rain were to cause significant deterioration of the Gaiety’s interior, the 
developer could later use the argument that the structure was unsafe, facilitating 
demolition184.

Upon Ralph Cole’s reassurance that the windows had been removed only temporarily as 
part of the required hazardous materials abatement, the ISD allowed the pre-demolition 
activities to be completed185.  
 
 
The Holy Grail -- a demo permit 
 
Two months later, the pre-demolition work had been completed and Kensington was 
ready to proceed with their project186.  On November 24th, they applied for a demo permit 
for the Gaiety.   
 
Shirley Kressel immediately wrote to Gary Moccia, Assistant Commissioner at the ISD.  
Citing the well used Article 38-21.2 as well as problems with the assignment of the PDA 
zoning, Kressel asserted that the ISD was obligated, as Boston’s zoning enforcement 
agency to deny the permit for the Gaiety187.  But her comments fell on deaf ears.  The fact 
that a Certificate of Consistency from the BRA accompanied the permit application was 
apparently considered sufficient proof of legality.  Thus, on December 10th, Kensington 
got its demo permits.  Demolition was permitted to commence as early as seven days 
later188.   
 
 
Take ‘em to court 
 
The morning the permits were issued, attorney Ken Tatarian delivered a motion to Land 
Court seeking to stay the effectiveness of any demo permits already granted; a hearing on

the motion was also requested.  The hearing was granted, and on December 17th, Land 
Court Judge Keith Long heard testimony for and against such an action189.   
 
Tatarian argued that, as an abutter to Kensington’s properties, the Glass Slipper would be 
harmed by the demolition because the new development did not conform to the 
underlying zoning of the district. Furthermore, if demolition were allowed, his client 
would be unable to advertise that it was located “next to the historic Gaiety Theater.”190     
 
If this argument seems like a stretch, it perhaps makes more sense to consider that the 
driving force behind this lawsuit may have been an attempt to prevent, or at least delay 
the demolition for another reason.191  About one year prior, three lawsuits had been filed 
in Land Court against the Boston Zoning Commission claiming that the PDA designation 
for the Kensington project had been granted inappropriately.  One case had been brought 
by a small coalition including three Boston City Councilors, several neighborhood 
activists (including Kressel) and the Oni Collaborative – a group leasing space across the 
street from the project site192.  Nicholas Romano, co-owner of the Glass Slipper, had filed 
the other two.  In November 2004, Judge Long had ruled that the activists and city 
councilors did not have standing193.  One week later the Oni Collective dropped the case 
entirely194.  Additionally, Romano’s two cases were consolidated into one.  But at the 
time the demo permit was issued, Long had still not ruled on the legality of the PDA 
zoning for Kensington’s site – a decision was not expected until that coming March190.  
Romano presumably calculated that the odds of a ruling against the PDA designation 
would be far more likely if they were not fighting against development of an empty lot.  
Such a ruling would save the Gaiety; but it would also prevent Kensington’s project from

191 Even Judge Long would later write, “It is unclear how being next to ‘the historic Gaiety Theatre’ will 
affect the number or demographics of the Glass Slipper’s customers.” (The Boston Globe, 12/22/2004)

proceeding as planned and would therefore halt the eminent domain seizure of the Glass 
Slipper.   
 
Regardless of the reason for the Slipper’s suit against the issuance of a permit, 
Kensington agreed it would take no action until after Judge Long had issued this 
decision, which came on December 21st
.
195   Writing that Tatarian had failed to 
demonstrate how razing the theater would bring irreparable harm to the Glass Slipper, 
Judge Long rejected the Slipper’s request for a preliminary injunction against the demo.  
Long noted that though his “sympathies lie with the preservationists… the facts and the 
law do not.”196 The Glass Slipper appealed its case to the Massachusetts Appeals Court 
the following day; but within 24 hours, the Appeals Court had upheld the Land Court’s 
decision197.  
 
It seemed like the Gaiety was on her last legs.  Then, on the last day of the year, she was 
granted “another reprieve,” much to the relief of the preservationists198.  On behalf of his 
client, Ken Tatarian had submitted a brief to Judge Francis Spina of the Massachusetts 
Supreme Court and once again, Kensington agreed to wait for the decision before taking 
any action.   
 
The case was heard on January 11, 2005.  This time, Tatarian included the point that the 
demolition of the Gaiety would deprive his client of “several substantial arguments” in 
their legal case regarding the PDA designation.  But it was still to no avail.  In addition to 
concluding that lack of an injunction would not result in irreparable harm, Judge Spina 
disagreed with the assertion that demolition of the theater would undermine their legal 
challenge to validity of the PDA overlay district.  He wrote, “Their suit in the Land Court 
does not depend on whether the ‘Gaiety Theatre’ building remains standing, but on

whether the District Plan was properly amended.”199  With the injunction denied, the 
Glass Slipper’s efforts to save the Gaiety came to an end200.   
 
 
The last few months 
 
Despite countless strikes against their cause, Gaiety supporters had not given up.  In early 
January 2005, they organized a small rally in front of the former theater with the hope of 
calling the media’s attention to their cause.  Though 40 people showed up, some carrying 
signs decrying the “Bad Redevelopment Authority,”201 the event failed to attract any 
substantial press coverage202.  Afterwards, one loyal supporter suggested that some 
“dedicated folks [should go to] the site in shifts and physically prevent demolition,” 
adding, “Dramatic confrontations like that get big news coverage,”203 but nothing ever 
came of the suggestion.   
 
In February, as interior demolition of the Gaiety got underway, Kressel, tried another 
approach.  She asked Julie Crockford, an employee at the Museum of Afro American 
History, to call for Mayor Menino’s help in saving the theater as “an active, vibrant, 
operating element of the Black Heritage Trail, rather than a picture in a history book….”  
She also brazenly suggested that Crockford should indicate that doing so would “save 
him from making a shameful mistake and insulting the black community.”  Obligingly, 
Crockford forwarded Kressel’s email to the BLC along with a request for the mayor to 
help save “THE vaudeville theater where black actors worked.”204  Frank Cullen from the 
American Vaudeville Museum was more critical of the mayor,  “That the elected and 
appointed officials of the City of Boston encouraged and permitted the demolition of 
Boston’s most important theater for African American performing artists, the Gaiety

Theatre, and did so during Black History month 2005 is an indication of racial, cultural 
and artistic insensitivity and a collective tin ear….”205  
 
As the interior demolition continued, the Gaiety supporters had one small fight left.  In 
January, City Councilors Turner and Arroyo had secured an appeal with the Boston 
Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA).  Like the Glass Slipper before them, they claimed that 
the issuance of a demo permit for the Gaiety had violated Article 38-21 and they sought 
reversal of its issuance.  On March 29th, a crowd of over 40 activists, preservationists and 
community members descended on City Hall for the hearing, ready to plead their case.  
But before anyone got to speak, ZBA chair Robert Shortsleeve dismissed the case, as per 
the instruction of the City’s corporation counsel, Merita Hopkins; as this issue had 
previously gone before the courts, the board members were to follow the precedent set by 
that decision and stated that the activists had no legal standing206,207.  
 
The supporters would not take “no” for an answer; as described by Councilor James 
Kelly (a supporter of the Kensington Project):  
 

“There were several members of the antidevelopment group that were shouting, and 
security had been called… They came close to making an arrest.  They were being 
unruly, shouting, and being disruptive.”207 

 
When the shouting got them nowhere, Councilors Maura Hennigan, Turner and Arroyo, 
determined to speak to the Counsel, led “a parade of citizens”206 to Hopkins’s office, 
ready for a sit-in if necessary.   
 
Though a decision on the hearing was not given that afternoon, the board did eventually 
agree to hear the testimony, allowing the four city councilors, Lee Eiseman and Ching-In

At the hearing, Councilor Hennigan had asked for a stay on demolition until the board’s

zoning was still pending, no court order or injunction had been issued to invalidate any of 
the Kensington project’s “major discretionary approvals”; leaving Kensington “free to 
exercise rights under them.”211
 
The Gaiety lasted for three more weeks; but by April 20th, her time had finally come – 
demolition was underway.   
 
The wrecking ball methodically punched away the old building’s walls, gradually 
exposing the once-grand theater to the outside world.  Three weeks later, all that 
remained was a pile of rubble212.  The Gaiety was no more.213

Epilogue 
 
Over the next few weeks and months, the remnants of the Gaiety will be loaded into 
trucks and hauled away along with the pieces of what used to be the Club New Orleans 
(25 LaGrange Street).  The Glass Slipper (15-17 LaGrange Street), has yet to be seized, 
and the neighboring property at 1-13 La Grange Street, is still standing, but all indications 
suggest that both will share the Gaiety’s fate.  The latter is already owned by one of 
Kensington’s principals214 and the BRA issued a “notice of intent” for the strip club in 
late January215.  Many have rationalized the Gaiety’s demolition by noting the merits of 
the planned development – the 61 units of affordable housing, the additional property tax 
revenue for Boston’s coffers and the removal of a vestigial Combat Zone establishment – 
unfortunately, none of these benefits are guaranteed.  
 
It is almost certain that the Glass Slipper would be forced out of its current location – 
despite its legal challenge to the PDA, the club is unlikely to win as Boston’s “virtually 
bulletproof” PDAs have always held up in court216.    However, in mid-April, with eager 
assistance from the BRA (which is, of course, legally required to help the business 
relocate) the club’s owners entered into negotiations for an alternate location – a four 
story building almost directly across the street from where the Slipper currently sits217.  A 
combination of zoning restrictions, eminent domain regulations and First Amendment 
rights may keep the strip club in the neighborhood after all.   
 
The 17% affordable housing that the project will provide, when only 10% is legally 
required, seems rather admirable, while the taxes such a structure would generate are 
substantial.  Yet a recent article in The Boston Herald questioned the developer’s ability 
to follow through on the project – obviously, a project that goes uncompleted generates 
no affordable housing, and taxes on an empty lot just don’t compare.  Noting the 
development team’s complete lack of experience with projects of this scale – a high-rise

tower likely to cost well over $100 million – the author predicts, “a dim future: Another 
rubble-strewn site that sits on the market for years, its would-be developers waiting for a 
big payday.”218  
 
Is Kensington considering a property flip?  The possibility can’t be denied.  When the 
developers first submitted their PNF in late 2001, it was projected that the job would be 
completed in July 2004; but as of mid-May of 2005 demolition is still underway.  Market 
conditions change and by the time Kensington can officially break ground it may feel that 
building luxury condominiums on the site no longer projects to a worthwhile return on 
investment.  If so, the Gaiety may have been lost to a parking lot.  
 
In the end, the benefits of the Kensington project - housing, taxes, revitalization of a 
downtrodden neighborhood - may come to pass.  On the other hand, the preservationists 
may be proven right - Boston will come to regret the loss of yet another historical theater. 
Only time will tell.

ARTICLE 38 – MIDTOWN CULTURAL DISTRICT 
 

SECTION 38-1. Statement of Purpose, Goals, and Objectives.  The goals and 
objectives of this article and the Midtown Cultural District Plan are to direct downtown 
development in a way that promotes balanced growth for Boston; to prevent 
overdevelopment of the Financial District and the Back Bay by promoting mixed-use 
development in Midtown; to revitalize Midtown as the region's center for performing and 
visual arts by rehabilitating historic theaters and creating new cultural facilities for the 
city's nonprofit arts community; to protect the quality of life and provide for expansion of 
the thriving Chinatown neighborhood by creating affordable housing and business 
opportunities, and by controlling institutional expansion in the area; to preserve Boston's 
historic resources and public open spaces, which provide enjoyment to all residents and 
visitors and which increase land values in their proximity, by virtue of historic, aesthetic, 
and environmentally beneficial qualities; to provide new and expanded facilities for 
community services; and to create a new residential neighborhood downtown by 
encouraging the development of housing which is affordable to all segments of the 
community.  
 
SECTION 38-21. Restrictions on Change of Use or Occupancy of Theaters. The 
Commissioner of the Inspectional Services Department shall not issue a change of use or 
occupancy permit for any Theater within the Midtown Cultural District, as identified in 
the Midtown Cultural District Plan, except in accordance with the provisions of this 
section.  
 

1. Demolition of Unsafe Theaters. The Commissioner of the Inspectional 
Services Department may issue a demolition permit where the Theater or building 
is unsafe and demolition is required pursuant to the provisions of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts State Building Code.  
2. Authorized Change of Use or Occupancy of Theaters. Excepting the 
provisions of paragraph 1 of this section, the Commissioner of the Inspectional 
Services Department shall issue a change of use or occupancy permit for any 
Theater within the Midtown Cultural District under the provisions of Article 6 
only if the Board of Appeal finds, after reviewing the recommendations, if any, of 
appropriate City departments and agencies, and appropriate community and 
neighborhood organizations in the Midtown and Chinatown areas, and in addition 
to all other conditions required under Section 6-3, Section 6-3A, and Section 6-4, 
where applicable, that: (a) change of use or occupancy of the Theater structure 
will not unduly diminish the historic character of the Midtown Cultural District as 
a cultural, entertainment, and theatrical showcase, taking into consideration: (i) 
current physical characteristics of the Theater that affect its suitability for use as a 
Theater, including but not limited to seating capacity, interior configuration, and 
location; (ii) history of its use as a Theater; (iii) the likelihood of its future use for 

 

58

Theater production; and (iv) the Applicant's plans for replacement of the Theater 
structure with performing arts facilities supportive of the objectives and 
specifications of the Midtown Cultural District Plan. In its approval of a 
conditional use under this Section 38-21.2, the Board of Appeal shall attach as 
conditions and safeguards, at a minimum, that: (b) the Applicant for any Proposed 
Project on the lot containing a portion or all of the former site of the Theater 
either (i) replace that Theater with a fully equipped new Theater or other cultural 
facility of a condition, size, and type which is appropriate, under the 
circumstances pertaining at the time of the permit application, to contribute to the 
balance of cultural facilities responsive to the needs of the Midtown Cultural 
District, as identified in the Midtown Cultural District Plan; or (ii) substantially 
rehabilitate or cause the substantial rehabilitation of an existing Theater, in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Section 38-21; and (c) the 
Applicant provide evidence of a long-term commitment by the Applicant itself or 
a third party either (i) to use the Theater or cultural facility in accordance with the 
Midtown Cultural District Plan; or (ii) to lease or otherwise transfer such Theater 
or cultural facility for such use (which may include a lease or transfer to the City 
of Boston or its designee). In the case of a new Theater, the new Theater must 
provide for sufficient facilities to support Theater operations, such as 
administrative offices, rehearsal studio space, dressing room/green room space, 
and storage space, as identified in the Midtown Cultural District Plan. In the case 
of a Theater in a building or an interior designated as a Landmark, such permit 
must also be authorized by the Boston Landmarks Commission, in accordance 
with Chapter 772 of the Acts of 1975, as amended from time to time. The 
Applicant shall also enter into an agreement for substantial rehabilitation of an 
existing Theater, as detailed in Section 38-25, where applicable.  
 
3. Qualification of Substantial Rehabilitation of a Theater. Substantial 
rehabilitation of an existing Theater qualifying for approval under this Section 38-
21 consists of: (a) major interior or structural changes for the purpose of 
improving the Theater's design and its viability for Theater use, including an 
equipment level commensurate with its anticipated use, as detailed in the 
Midtown Cultural District Plan; or (b) historic restoration of the interior of the 
Theater. Major exterior renovations and improvements, such as a façade  
restoration, may also be included in qualifying as substantial rehabilitation. 
Substantial rehabilitation to the interior of a Theater may include, without 
limitation, such work as expanding stage or wings, reraking the orchestra, 
increasing rehearsal, dressing room, or lobby space, or historic restoration. It may 
also include conversion to Theater use of a original Theater currently in other use. 
Substantial rehabilitation does not mean normal Theater maintenance, parking, or 
improvements to mechanical systems alone.

ARTICLE 85 – DEMOLITION DELAY 
 

SECTION 85-1. Statement of Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to establish a 
predictable process for reviewing requests to demolish certain buildings in order to: (1) 
establish an appropriate waiting period during which the City and the Applicant can 
propose and consider alternatives to the demolition of a building of historical, 
architectural, cultural or urban design value to the City; (2) provide an opportunity for the 
public to comment on the issues regarding the demolition of a particular building; and (3) 
minimize the number and extent of building demolitions where no immediate re-use of 
the site is planned.
