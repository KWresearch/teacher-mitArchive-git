The Wild Duck 

 

The “wild duck” in the play The Wild Duck, written by Henrik Ibsen, is both physical and 

metaphorical. On the one hand, it refers to a specific duck that fell into the river after being 

injured by Old Werle, and chose to grip onto the weed in the depths of the river. The duck was 

then brought back to the surface by a clever dog and nurtured to health under the care of the 

 
Ekdal family. Simultaneously, the duck also symbolizes one who has his head buried in the sand, 

holding onto certain perceptions of reality, unable to live without some illusion. In this context, 

the dog then represents the enlightened one who appears to drag the “wild duck” out of its 

delusional state. 

 

The play parallels the story of the wild duck and makes great use of the associated 

imagery. The foundation for the play lies in past events between two families, which we learn 

about through conversations between characters Gregers, his father Old Werle and his good 

friend Hjalmar. Through Greger ’s confrontations with Old Werle, we learn that a long time ago, 

Old Werle and his business partner Old Ekdal had been involved in a deal that went awry; Old 

Ekdal alone had gotten arrested for a crime they were involved in together. Later, Werle, who 

was married to Greger ’s mother, also had an affair with and impregnated one of his own 

housemaids, Gina. In an attempt to compensate for the mistakes he made, Werle encouraged 

Gina and Ekdal’s son, Hjalmar, to get married. He also continued to grant monetary support to 

1Ekdal’s family, which Hjalmar greatly benefited from, in order to have access to Gina’s house. 

However, neither Werle nor Gina ever revealed to Hjalmar the true motives for Ekdal’s actions. 

 

Unaware of these previous agreements, Hjalmar builds a life with Gina and the girl he 

believes to be his daughter, Hedvig. He is comfortable with his lifestyle, knowing that he has 

some monetary ties to Old Ekdal but fully believing that he is the one his family looks up to and 

 
depends on. Upon learning of the illusions that had been cast on Hjalmar by his father Old Werle, 

Gregers is furious and sets out to enlighten Hjalmar on these familial affairs from the past, 

 
beginning by moving into the Ekdals’ home. During this process he comments that he would like 

 
to play the “wild dog” that saves the “wild ducks” -- Hjalmar, and his family -- that were harmed 

by Old Werle. 

 

As noble as Greger ’s original intentions, this creates all sorts of problems. This is because 

at the core, all the characters in the play seek their sense of purpose and identity on what they 

perceive to be truths; this concept forms the spine of the play. They are constantly in pursuit of 

some kind of dignity in the face of reality. When Gregers decides to burst the bubble to Hjalmar, 

the truths Hjalmar and his family had assumed to be permanent are turned upside down, and 

along with it, a sense of who they are. 

 

From the beginning of the play we see that each of the characters have something they 

seem completely certain about in their lives and take great pride in. On one end we have 

Hjalmar, who knows he is the breadwinner of his family; for him, this is his identity. He 

understands that he depends somewhat on Werle for his family’s income, but he works really 

 
hard to break that dependence. He does not doubt for a second that his family relies on him; after 

all, why wouldn’t they? In fact, he believes that his family owes a significant portion of the 

2quality of their lives to him -- for example, he introduces his wife to Gregers as the lady who was  

“not entirely without culture”, as a consequence of her “associating with (himself) every day”. 

As we later learn, this pride stems from the fact that he was always the center of attention and 

was greatly admired in his earlier days. 

 

Though Hjalmar complains that the expectations of being the breadwinner are high when 

he forgets to bring candy home to Hedvig as promised, deep down he understands that this is part 
 

of this role he chose to assume. At the very least, he asserts it constantly to the people around 

him. He also insists on doing things himself, without his family’s help. This in itself is quite 

ironic, because throughout the entire play we see again and again that Hjalmar can hardly survive 
 

without Gina. 

 

With these beliefs firmly established in his mind, he works on an invention. As we later 

learn, he pursues his inventing career with a “breadwinner ’s dream” -- to  make a lot of money 

and then pass away, leaving Gina to be the breadwinner ’s widow. From Hjalmar ’s point of view, 

this would make Gina dependent on him for all of her life, as he assumes that Gina would not be 

in a position to make a living on her own. In addition, he fully believes that Hedvig, the daughter 
 

of the house, admires him and believes in his work, and this is what fuels his feeling of purpose. 

 

Hedvig bears many similarities to Hjalmar. Hjalmar has not told her that she was taken 

out of school because she is going blind, so she believes that taking care of the wild duck is her 

purpose in life, and has little interest in the “real” world. As with Hjalmar, she is proud of this 

reality and constantly feels a need to assert her identity; we see this when she claims the wild 

duck as her own, over and over, throughout the play -- not her father ’s, or her family’s, but her 

3very own, because she takes care of it. This is her truth, and to her, part of living a truthful life is 

making sure people do not misinterpret her reality.  

 

One the other side we have Gregers, the character who drives all of the unravelling action 

and disillusionment in the play. Because he witnessed his mother ’s misery due to Werle’s affair 

with Gina when he was younger, Gregers is convinced that a truthful marriage lies in beginning 

with a clean slate with no deception.  He begins to believe it is his responsibility to correct the 

wrongs that the Werle family inflicted on Ekdal’s family, to “establish a true marriage” in which 

there are no secrets between Hjalmar and Gina. 

 

In the first half of the play Gregers gradually solidifies this identity and clarifies his 

mission for himself. At the beginning of the second half of the play, the conflict and event of the 

play arises when Gregers decides to act on this purpose in a way that directly shatters Hjalmar ’s 

perceived reality. 

 

When Gregers informs Hjalmar about the history between his own family and Ekdal’s. 

Hjalmar realizes that the people around him had never depended on him as much he had thought, 
 

and the foundation to support all of his previous actions disappears. Suddenly, this boy who had 

been admired greatly since his early days learns that he is not the center of attention anymore. 

 

The unravelling gains in intensity as Hjalmar confronts Gina, his wife. What complicates 

matters, of course, is that Gina has a different interpretation to Hjalmar of what living a truthful 

life entails in terms of how the past factors into the reality of the present, and how important the 

whole truth is in relation to things like happiness and love. Gina knows that she loves Hjalmar 

deeply and only wants to do what’s best for him; in order to accomplish this, she believes that 

whatever happened in the past with Werle should stay in the past. What’s noteworthy, however, is 
 

4that Gina never outright lies to him, and confesses to the matter when prompted. Meanwhile, she 

finds her purpose and dignity in devoting herself to Hjalmar selflessly.  Hjalmar, however, can’t 

get over the fact that Gina and Hedvig did not depend on him as much as he had believed. He 

lets it be known that he now hates the wild duck, because it had been Werle’s property at one 

point in time. 

 

When Hjalmar also verifies that Hedvig may not be his child, he breaks completely. 

Having lost his identity as breadwinner, combined with his idealistic and absolute notions of 

love, he can’t understand how anyone could possibly love him. Losing faith in Hedvig’s 

 
adoration, he also loses the reason to pursue his invention. Just like the duck who had a hard time 

adjusting to life after being saved by the dog, Hjalmar has a very hard time adjusting to this lack 

of definition and certain truth in his life, and he decides that he must leave the house. 

 

However, as we see in a highly comical scene near the end of the play, he has a very 

difficult time with that, too. First he makes a big show of not being able to stand living in the 

house, but then he realizes how harsh it would be to move out and tries very hard to find a 

graceful way to stay. He understands he can no longer rely on old truths, but doesn’t yet have the 

courage to seek new ones. What we witness is his indecisiveness played out in drama-queen 

style, particularly when he tells to Gina to “Pack, and get the room ready!”. In the midst of all 

 
this Hjalmar can’t bear the sight of Hedvig, because he believes that she is the fundamental cause 

of all his suffering. 

 

Of course, of all of the characters Hjalmar could have chosen to take the blame, Hedvig is 

 
the one innocent character in the play that is completely free from deceit. She hardly understands 

what is going on, though she tries very hard to interpret it. Hjalmar mentions that he wished that 

5he could shoot the duck, but would not, because of Hedvig. As mentioned already, Hedvig’s 

understanding of her purpose in life is to take care of the wild duck; however, that is shattered 

when she realizes her father cares neither about the wild duck nor about her. As Hedvig gradually  

senses that her father is leaving her, she feels the pressing need to make sure people understand 

her. Her ultimate sacrifice could be regarded as the biggest display of truth and dignity in the 

play. Unable to comprehend her dad’s actions, she finds a way to express her love for her father 

-- by killing herself. 

 

What’s surprising is how quickly Hjalmar calms down and gains a sense of security the 

instant he learns that Hedvig died because of her love for him. In that moment, he finds an 

inkling of truth to support his original purpose, and decides not to leave after all. Just like the 

duck had a hard time adjusting after being saved until it is brought under domesticity in the 

 
Ekdal household, it is another perceived truth that Hjalmar can latch to that reaffirms his purpose 

in life. 

 

The results, of course, are tragic. Hedvig is dead. The result of Gregers’ pure intentions 

are hardly favorable. The case in the play that contrasts this, where lack of deceit results in a 

favorable outcome is in Old Werle’s new marriage, which is mentioned briefly. In that case, Mrs. 

Sorby decides to let Old Werle in on all of the gossip in her life, and both of them are able to 

make peace with the past. What is different about their case is that no one else is involved 

besides Werle and Mrs. Sorby. The stakes don’t involve a teenage girl who is trying to figure out 

her life. 

 

While the disillusionment of Hjalmar and Hedvig engages us emotionally, the playwright 

engages us intellectually through the character of Dr. Relling. He, too, has his own notions of 

6truth and his purpose. In the same way that Gregers feels it necessary to spread his ideas about 

what it means to live a truthful life, Dr Relling feels it is his responsibility as a doctor to give 

people what he coins a “life-illusion” when it is called for. One of his most famous lines in the 

play is “Take away a person’s vital life-lie, and you deprive them of happiness.” According to Dr. 
 

Relling, a person’s “life-lie” and sense of purpose are intimately related, and it is this sense of 

purpose that keeps a person happy. When explaining the concept to Gregers, he refers to it 

exactly as he sees it -- as a lie, and not an ideal. 

 

For example, he convinces Hjalmar that he has talent at inventing something 

photography-related. What’s interesting is that although we see Hjalmar content toiling at this 

invention day after day, we never get to know what this mysterious invention is. This makes his 

pursuit of this invention seem illusory to us because it never really takes on a tangible form. It is 

also evident that Dr. Relling only partially believes in the likelihood that Hjalmar would actually 

succeed in this mission. 

 

At first glance, spreading lies doesn’t seem to suggest that the truth is important to Dr. 

Relling. However, through his interactions with everyone else we realize that he is the most 

disillusioned character of them all; perhaps he accepts the fact that everyone needs a life-lie as 

the truth. Coincidentally, he also appears to be one of the least happy characters in the play, 

which we see when he speaks about his job as a doctor. In a sense, he finds purpose in and deals 

with reality he accepts by taking care of the people around him in the same way that Hedvig 

protects the duck from the wild. He provides shelter to others from the truth. 

 

Most significantly, Dr. Relling acknowledges the full complexity of Ekdal’s family 

situation, especially with regards to the Hedvig, who he firmly believes has no part in the deceit 

7and should not have to pay for the consequences. Dr. Relling exhibits the most concern for the 

child’s well-being throughout the entire ordeal; in stark contrast, Gregers sees Hedvig as the 

completely innocent and hence perfect hero to save the family. He suggests that Hedvig commit 

self-sacrifice by shooting the duck that her father suddenly hates so much. 

 

At first, Gregers appears to be the mindful puppeteer, calculating ways to cause 

destruction; however, upon closer reading we csee that what drives him isn’t that different from 

what drives the other characters in the play. Gregers, unlike Dr. Relling, is simply insensitive to 

 
the nuances of the situation in the Ekdal household; his idealized concepts of truth and a “truthful 

marriage” do not incorporate these ideas. In a way, he is just as delusional as the people he is 

 
trying to save. Even after Hjalmar ’s life crumbles, Gregers insists that his friend is now a happier 

and a greater man, and when Hedvig dies, he is convinced that this tragedy brings out the 

 
greatness in Hjalmar. After all, it is only in this way that he can stay dignified. Hence, Dr. Relling 

would probably say that it is a “life-lie” that supports the purpose Gregers enacts for himself: the 

illusion that he could bring out the greatness in people by making them see the complete truth. 

This is further illuminated at the end of the play: Gregers realizes that life isn’t worth living 

when he is informed by Dr. Relling that Hjalmar could never be the hero that Gregers wishes he 

would become. 

 

As we witness this struggle between Relling and Gregers, and how Greger ’s choices 

affect the Ekdal family, I think the question the author ultimately asks us, in simple terms, is: 

 
should the dog have saved the duck? It is this question that lies under the conflict of the play, and 

sheds light on the spine -- the pursuit of some kind of purpose and dignity in the face of truth. 

The ending of the Wild Duck seems to suggest that sometimes, the wild duck may not wish or 

8need to be saved. Even more, sometimes the dog may be in fact a “duck”, just of a different kind 

-- the kind that holds onto unrealistic ideals and illusions of greatness.
