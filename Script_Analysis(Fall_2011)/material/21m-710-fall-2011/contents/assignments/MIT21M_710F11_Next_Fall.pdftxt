“Next Fall”: A Look at the Production and Characters

 

Next  Fall, written  by  Geoffrey  Nauffts,  is  a   touching   play  about  the  five-year-homosexual 

relationship  between  two  middle-aged  men   --  Adam,  an  atheist, and  Luke,  a  devout  Christian,   the 

relationship  conflicts   that   came   with   their   different  backgrounds   in   faith,  and   how   an   accident 

involving  Luke   affected   everyone   around   him.   This  past   Friday,   I   was   fortunate   to   watch   the 

Speakeasy  production   of  this  play  as   directed  by  Paul  Daigneault  with  a   group  of   friends  at   the 

  to  be  full  of  humorous  dialogue  and 
  Arts.  I  found  the  script 
Boston  Center  for  the 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  interesting 

character  relationships,   and   I   thoroughly  enjoyed  watching   the   best  elements   from  it  brought   to 

life in Daigneault’s interpretation.

 

When   reading   the   original   script,   the   very  first  thing   we   hear   is  “brakes   screeching   to   a  

crashing  halt,  followed  by  a  car  horn  stuck   in plaintive  wail”.   In  the  Speakeasy  production  of   the 

play, the   first  thing   we   heard   instead  was  a character   saying   “In   a moment,   in  the twinkling   of   an 

eye,   at   the   last  trumpet,   for   the   trumpet   shall   sound,   and   the   dead  shall   be   raised   incorruptible, 

and  we  shall  be   changed”,  while   facing   us   under   spotlight  at   the  center   of   the  stage.  The  lights 

faded   and   we  were   instantly   transported   to  a   hospital   waiting   room   illuminated  by   harsh 

fluorescent light, with a man and a woman sitting tensely on opposite ends of a couch.

 

To   begin,  I   found  this  deviation   from   the   sound  cue   directions,   as  written   in   the   script,   to  

be an  interesting   but  effective   choice. Although  the  car  horn  may  have   given  the  onset  of  the play 

1

1a  sense  of  urgency,   this   less  dramatic  interpretation  was   unnerving   in   its  own  way.   For  me,  the  


reason  the  characters  were  in  the   waiting   room  took  longer  to  sink  in   -- were   they  at  the   hospital 

for  an  appointment?   Was   one   of   them  ill? 
 
  As   three   more  people   --  Arlene,   Butch,   and  finally 

Adam  --  entered   the   room   one-by-one   and  began   to   talk,   it  dawned   on   us   as   an   audience   that 

these  characters  had   all  come  to  this  room  because  someone   named   Luke  had   gotten   into  a   car 

accident, and they were just as dazed as we were to be there.

 

It  was   crucial   we   understood   immediately   that  we   were   looking   at   a   waiting   room,   for 

this  helped   set  up  a   general nervousness  in   the  room.  The  set  for  the   place where   these  characters 

were  congregated  was  similar  to  what  I  would  have   imagined  the   space   to   look  like  based  on  the 

script   --  there   was   a   three-seater   couch   in   the   center   of   the   room   behind   a   small   coffee  table 

flanked  by   two   one-seater   couches   on   the   sides.   There   were   some  magazines   on   a   table   in  the 

right  corner,  a  small  vase   of  flowers,  and  a   coat  rack  in the   left  corner   --  all   typical  of   those  in   the 

waiting  room   at  a   small   hospital.  If   I   remember   correctly,   on   the   back wall   there  was  a   window 

with  white   shades  that  were  drawn.  The  entire  room   looked   very  quiet,  confined   and  miserable. 

Of   particular   interest  were   the   curtains   that  were  present   throughout   the   play  hanging   from   the 

sides  of   the   stage   --  before   the   play   began,   maple   leaf  shadows   were   cast   onto   the   curtains 

indicating the season was autumn, but they were now white hospital curtains. 

 

 As   we  watched  

Adam,  the   last   character   to  
 

arrive,  become   aware   of   the  seriousness   of 
 

Luke’s   condition,   the  set   quickly   transformed.   We   were   suddenly   experiencing   nighttime  in 

Manhattan  --  the  couch  had  become  a   garden  chair  on an  apartment  rooftop,  and  the   lighting   was 

warmer   like   that   from   a  porch   lamp.  As  we   were  introduced   to   Luke,   we  learned   we   were   now 

watching  a   memory  flashback  of   something   that  happened  in  the   past  --  the   first  time Adam   and 

2

2Luke met.  Toward   the  end  of the  scene   Luke  began  getting   closer to  Adam   and finally  asked  him  


out,  after  which   he  left  the   stage   through   a   door.   The   lighting   on Adam   turned  cold,  and  Adam 

was standing in the waiting room once again, in the same spot.

 

Transitions  like   these   in   this  play  were  very  important  to   the playwright  --  in his  Author ’s  

Note, he  mentions   that  it’s  a  “memory  play”   and   transitions  should  be  “seamless”  for  flashbacks, 

suggesting  never   quite   letting   the  waiting   room   disappear.  Originally  I   thought  that  if   I   were   to 

direct   the   play,   I   would   try  to   keep  Adam   onstage   during   the   transitions   between  memory   and 

waiting  room  scenes,  but  as  I  was  watching  Daigneault’s  production   I  realized   that   I   would  also 

want Adam to leave the stage sometimes to change costumes.

 

I  really  enjoyed   many  of   the  transitions  in   the   Speakeasy  production. At   the   end   of   one 

memory   scene,   the   lights   dimmed   and   the   characters   walked   around   in   the   dark   fluidly   in 

seemingly   random   paths   before   leaving   the   stage   altogether.   They   then   reassembled   quickly 

onstage  as   the   lighting   changed   to   that  of   another   memory  scene.   This  particular   sequence   was 

powerful  to   me   because   it  evoked   the  confusion   that  results  sometimes   from   drifting   out  of   one 

dream  and   into  another.   Some  of   the   transitions   were   accompanied   by  dreamy,   rhythmic   music, 

at   times  cheery,   at   times   melancholy.   In   general,   I  noticed   myself   craving   Luke’s   presence  the 

instant  transitions  were   made   into  scenes where   he   wasn’t  onstage   (such   as   those   in   the   waiting 

room), perhaps in part because of the drearier lighting that resulted whenever he left.

 

Through   a   series   of   similar   transitions   into   and   out  of   flashbacks  to   the   past   throughout  

the  play,  we   witnessed   the   development  of  Adam   and   Luke’s   relationship  from  the  onset  to   the 

moment  the   “honeymoon  just ended”  (as  it  is written  in  the stage directions)  and what  ultimately 

3

3set  up  the major  conflict  of   the   entire   play.  This  was  the   moment  when  Adam, an  atheist  if  there 


ever was one, discovered that Luke was a devout Christian. 

 

 

 

 

ADAM: So you’re a what, then...you’re -- a...

LUKE: Christian.

ADAM: Okay. (Tries to proceed with breakfast as usual)

The   actors   who  played  Luke  and  Adam,  Dan  Roach  and  Will   McGarrahan,   respectively,  

did  a   wonderful   job   at   capturing   both   the  chemistry   and   lighthearted   banter   between   these 

characters,  as  well   as  the   awkwardness  between  them   as  they  struggled   to   find  common   ground 

in  their  faith.  From  the  start,   Adam  could  not   understand  many   of   the  things   Luke  believed, 

choosing to question Luke with extreme questions like: 

ADAM:  So,  then,   if   Mathew   Shepard   hadn’t   accepted   Christ   before   he   died,   he’s   in   hell,   and  his   killers 

who, say have, are going heaven? Is that what you are saying?” 

 

As  the   relationship  progressed,  Adam   learned  that  he  wanted   more   and  more   for   Luke   to  

embrace  their  relationship  and  value   it  over  Luke’s  relationship  with  God,  without  fear or  shame. 

This  was  manifested  in  many  ways.  Adam  wanted  Luke   to  introduce  him  to  his  Christian  parents 

(Butch  and  Arlene),  who   would  not  approve   of   his  dating   a   man,   and  his  younger  brother, Ben. 

(Luke  responded   to   this   by  saying   that   he   would  do   this   once   Ben   entered   college   and   could 

begin  to  make  his  own  decisions.)  Adam also  became  uncomfortable  with Luke  praying   after  sex 

-- so much, in face, that he decided to talk to Luke’s ex-boyfriend, Brandon, to ask for advice.

 

On   the   other   hand,   Luke   struggled   constantly  in   the   relationship  with   Adam   because   it  

was   both   a   blessing   and  a  sin   for   him,   and   he  craved   approval   from  God   and   his   parents.   Luke 

wished Adam   could   believe   in  God  so   that  he   could   be more   content  with  his  own  life,   and   not 

4

4constantly   worry   about   getting   thrombosis  or   brain  tumors.  However,   he   wasn’t   ever  really  


forwardly aggressive in his tactics to convince Adam to believe in God: 

 

 

 

 

LUKE: Is it so wrong for me to want for you to go to heaven? I mean, what’s the big fucking deal? 

ADAM: Yes, because i don’t believe in it, Luke. Not your version... 

LUKE: Fine, I’ll believe for the both of us.

When   I   read   the   script,   one   of   the   things  that   puzzled   me   was   what   held   the  couple  

together  for   so   long   --   five  years   --  until  Adam   finally  broke   it  off   just  before   Luke’s   accident. 

Similar   values  and  faith  are   often   considered   quite   fundamental   criteria  for  a   healthy  long-term 

relationship;  the  length   of   their   relationship  seemed   to   suggest   the   existence   of   something   that 

kept  them together  (besides  physical   attraction  --  though Luke did  find  Adam  “cute”)   through all 

the doubt and disrespect for each others’ beliefs. 

 

The   only  direct  reference   that  I  found   in   the   script  to   this  was  during   a  moment  in Scene  

4, when Luke   and  Adam  were  having   yet  another  conversation  about  their  faith.  In  the  Speakeasy 

production,  this   was   a   particularly   intimate   moment   as  Luke   was   lying   on   top   of   Adam   and 

stroking his chin tenderly. 

LUKE: You mentioned your soul the night we first met. 

ADAM: I did? 

LUKE:  You  said   it   was   fat.  That’s   how   I   knew   we   were   meant   to  be...You   believe,  Adam...that 

night...I knew that you would one day see. Please, Adam...For me.

 

This  was   a   reference   to   something   Luke   heard  Adam  tell   Holly  on  the   night   they  met:  

“My  body  may  not  be   (fat), but  my  soul   is.”  The   lines  above  caught  my  eye   as  it  suggested   that 

Luke  initially  became   attracted  to  Adam  because  he   saw  in  Adam  the  makings  of  a  Christian,  and 

hence had  imagined   an   ideal  Adam   from   the   day  he   met  him.  Perhaps  he   had,  with   or  without  a 

5

5savior  complex,  begun   dating   Luke   with   the  hope   of   eventually  watching   him   come   to   believe.  


This added a new dimension to Luke’s character for me.

 

After  watching   the   Speakeasy  production,   I  became   convinced  that  Adam  and  Luke  were  

both  willing   to  struggle   in  this  relationship  so   long   as  they  both  felt   like   there   was  a   possibility 

that the the other person’s beliefs would change. In the end, it was Adam who gave up: 

ADAM: How long’s your brother been at Georgia Tech? He’s a sophomore now, right? 

LUKE:  Uh-huh. 

ADAM: It’s never going to change, is it? (A beat.) 

LUKE.  I’m   not  sure  (They   sit  there   a   minute   longer,  one  looking  more   miserable   than   the  other, 

until Adam rises, grabs his weekend bag, and walks to the door.) 

ADAM. I don’t think I can do this anymore.

 

Meanwhile,  in  the   hospital   waiting   room  scenes  that  alternated  with   the   memory  scenes, 

we witnessed   the  direct  and   indirect  consequences  of   the  decisions Luke  and  Adam  made   in  their 

relationship.   During   the   first   half   of   the   play,   Luke’s   prospects   for   living   seemed   relatively 

  the  other   characters,  until 
optimistic  and  Adam   could   avoid   directly   interacting  with 
 
 
  suddenly 

Luke’s   previous   boyfriend,   Brandon   rushed  in   and  said,   “Something’s   changed”.   The   stakes 

became  particularly  high   in   the   second half   of  the   play,  when  it  began  to  dawn   on  the  characters 

that hope for Luke was steadily diminishing.

 

In  light   of   this,   the   script   takes   a   much   more   introspective   and   intense   turn,   and   in   his 

grief,  Adam   finally  has  no  choice   but  to  face   Luke’s  mother Arlene   and   his  father   Butch.   In   the 

Speakeasy  production  Arlene   told   a   very  personal   story  about  Luke’s  childhood,   in   monologue 

style  as   scripted,   to Adam   while   both   of   them   sat  on   a   bench   facing   the   audience.  The  curtains 

behind   them   were   illuminated   with   a   light   that   cast   maple   leaf   shadows.  After   the  scene,   the 

6

6lights  were   turned   off  and   the   same   curtains  were   then used  as  white   hospital   curtains  as  Adam  


(and  we)   finally  got   to   see   Luke   in   his   hospital   bed.   This   had   been   arranged  for   by  Brandon, 

(Luke’s   ex-boyfriend),   even   though  he   and   Adam   had   never  been   on   the   best   terms.   In   the 

hospital room, Adam exploded at Butch when Butch comes in and told him to leave: 

 

 

Adam: I WANT MORE TIME, ALRIGHT!? I’M NOT  ASKING ANYMORE, I’M TELLING YOU!

Through  each  of  these intense interactions,  we  slowly  came  to  the  realization  that  the  only  

reason  all   of   these   characters   stayed   in   that   same  small   room   together   was   because   of   their 

shared  love   for  Luke.  We   watched  the   characters  struggle   to   face   each  other  and   come  to   terms 

with their differences in preparation for a grief they knew they would all soon share. 

 

As  I   was   reading   the  script  again   it  occurred   to  me   that  Butch,   in   comparison   to  Arlene,  

had a   much  harder   time  accepting   things  that  were  different  from   the  way  he   thought  they  should 

be  --  such  as   his   son  dropping   out   of   law   school,   or   any   notion   of  homosexuality   and 

unmanliness.  Luke’s   mom   may   have   needed   drugs   to   cope,   but   when   Luke  died,  she   chose   to 

seek  consolation   in asking   Holly  to  retell   the  story  of  a   play  Luke   acted  in.  In  any  case,  she   was 

much   more   composed   than   Butch,   who   until   this  point   had   seemed   like   he   was   denying   the 

reality of his son’s death: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

BUTCH: They keep it so damn cold in here. How’s anyone supposed to... 

ARLENE: Do you want me to go get the pastor?.. 

BUTCH: The pastor? No I don’t think I need a pastor right now. 

ARLENE: How about a walk then (...) Just you and me. How about that? 

BUTCH: Another blanket...he needs another blanket...  

As  Butch,   the  man   who   believed   in   manliness,   finally  collapsed  on   the  floor   in  grief,   it  

was  a  poignant  playwright’s choice   to  have  Adam  ultimately  be  the one   to  catch Butch’s fall  and 

7

7console  him  with  his  words.  In  that  one  moment  I  realized that  Next  Fall  could  be  seen as  simply 

the  story  of  how  six   people with  very  different  beliefs  dealt  with  the   gradual   loss  of   a   loved   one 

by taking comfort in what was similar between themselves: memories of the loved one. 

 

We   never   really  did   learn  whether Adam  starting   believing   in  Christ;   in the  Author ’s Note  

the  author  warned  against  “redneck  behavior  and  proselytizing”,  and   there  doesn’t  appear   to  be   a 

clear  indication   in   the   script.   However,   we   did   see   Adam  finally  picking   up  a   phone   call   from 

Luke’s   brother   Ben,   facing   the   audience   under  spotlight,  and   saying   “My  name’s  Adam”   as   the 

lights began fading out -- all in a similar way to how the entire play began.
