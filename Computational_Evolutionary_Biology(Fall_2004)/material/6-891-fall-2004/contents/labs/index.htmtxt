Below is a tentative schedule of laboratory assignments for the course. Note
that each laboratory will generally consist of (1) a set of background readings
on the biological and computational theory behind the assignment; (2) a set of
'warm-up' preparatory exercises to gain familiarity with the software and the
assignment domain, perhaps including some non-computer problems; and (3) the
main assignment itself, which will be computer-based. Instructions for using
the software for each laboratory will be provided. Most of the programs and all
the data will be available for download to PCs, Macs, and LinuxÂ®-based
systems.
    * Goals. The aim of the lab work is to make sure that you get a chance to
      apply the theory to real data. We can talk and talk about evolutionary
      models, but in our experience, getting your hands dirty may be the best
      way to learn.
    * Mechanics. In general, the labs will involve computer work with modeling
      and application to âliveâ data sets. The computational models and
      data will always be available to either download to your own computer
      (either PC, MacintoshÂ®, or LinuxÂ® box), with the data available on the
      course website.Â  During the latter part of the course, we can use this
      time to talk about projects.
    * Format. Each lab will be divided into three parts: first, a âwarmupâ
      section to get familiar with the computational tools; second, brief
      questions that review and extend the lecture material; and third, a
      substantive application to a real data set drawn from the literature. We
      anticipate that each laboratory will take about two weeks, unless
      otherwise noted. In general, you wonât need to do your own programming
      in C++, Perl, JavaÂ®, etc. â rather, we will use off-the-shelf tools.
      However, some questions and projects later on may require some elementary
      skills with manipulating data, that you should be able to do via Perl, or
      MatlabÂ® â almost any such set of tools. If you find that challenging,
      do not despair. Please just talk to me: we can team up people that have
      complementary skill sets, or substitute alternative questions, etc.
    * Lab reports. We will strive to make this a âpaperlessâ class. Lab
      reports should be written up as web pages, with the final URL sent to
      professor.
    * Policy on cooperative work. We strongly encourage cooperation. You are
      free to work in groups, but please do write up your lab yourself
      (however, the Final Project is a team effort and requires only one write-
      up)
