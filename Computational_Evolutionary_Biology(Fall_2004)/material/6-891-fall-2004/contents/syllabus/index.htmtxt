***** Prerequisites *****
Computational evolutionary biology draws, naturally enough, from both the
disciplines of evolutionary biology and computer science. We expect
participants to have some familiarity with at least the basics of molecular
biology; elementary probability theory, calculus and differential equations;
and some facility in at least one programming language and/or mathematical
modeling.
The material covered in this course is selected in such a way that at its
completion you should be able to understand current papers in the field of
computational evolutionary biology.

provides an excellent overall view, while Hartl and Clark serves as a standard
reference for population genetics. For those desiring more mathematical depth,
see Felsenstein and Ewens.
***** Assignments *****
This course is discussion and lab oriented. That is, the work of the course is
done via active class participation and a series of laboratory exercises. There
are no exams, in particular, there will be no final exam. Class participation
will be encouraged in part by dividing each class period into two parts: the
first a more standard lecture, and the second a more interactive session that
will be led by class members in reaction to questions and readings appropriate
for that day's topic. Laboratories will be handed out approximately every two
weeks. The final project will involve an element of non determinism, i.e., so-
called 'free will', in that you will be able to choose your own project and
combine elements from the previous laboratories, or do something completely
new. We will get started on the final projects early, since we aim for your
team to present your project results in class. For the final project, we will
have people work in teams of 2 or 3 (but not more, and at my urging, not fewer
- solos are discouraged, but, like all labs, collaboration is encouraged - see
below).
The laboratory exercises are designed to be carried out mostly on your own
personal computer, or alternatively on the server. The software, along with
related software you may find helpful, is listed under the tools section of
this site. Generally, you will be able to download the software and datasets to
your own computer to do the laboratory exercises.
***** Turning in the Assignments *****
**** When ****
The assignments are due at the end of class on the due date, i.e., 4 PM on the
specified date.
**** How ****
Please construct (simple) web pages for your lab reports, and email the root
URL to me. If you do not know how to construct web pages, ask us - it is not
hard to learn.
***** Policies *****
**** Late Assignments ****
You have up to 30 (thirty) late days to use up, that can be distributed among
your laboratory projects. However, the last project must be turned during the
last week of class, even if you have not used all of your days by then.
Once you use up your late days, late projects will not earn any points, even
though they might be considered in borderline cases for the final grade. Thus
try to turn in all projects, even though you might feel they are not to be
counted. If you do not turn in a final (joint) project, you will receive an I
(incomplete) for the class, and will have to make this up by next term (the
incomplete will note that 80% of the coursework has been completed).
**** Cooperative Work and Plagiarism ****
Cooperative work is strongly encouraged; you are free to work together on
laboratory assignments. However, aside from the final project, you must write
up and turn in your own work. Please write the names of the people with whom
you worked at the top of the first page. Exact copies of laboratory reports
will not be acceptable. (Something other than your name and those of your co-
workers must be different!) The aim of the course (and its pedagogical
philosophy) is to learn about computational evolutionary biology. You will
learn more if you actually do the laboratory assignments.
***** Grading *****
Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following weighting scheme.
                    Grading Table
ACTIVITIES                                 PERCENTAGES
Laboratory Assignments                     40%
Final Project                              30%
Class Participation and Discussion Leading 30%
