1.‚ÄØ The non-mobile resources required to produce its breakthrough 
innovation were available in Sweden  
 
It found the optimal combination of resources through an emergent 
process of interaction with local customers, competitors, and 
shareholders in Sweden (~1955-70). 

2.‚ÄØ

 
 
i.‚ÄØ

 

IKEA‚Äôs performance worldwide was superior because the local 
optimum in Sweden was a global optimum (Porter, 1990) ‚Ä¶  
 
ii.‚ÄØ ‚Ä¶ and it found such local optimum with superior efficiency than other 
Swedish companies to whom the same resources and combinatorial 
context were available ‚Ä¶ 
 
iii.‚ÄØ ‚Ä¶ and it increased its geographic scope in such a way that its original 
national advantage was at least maintained.

Context for Firm Strategy 
and Rivalry
A local context and rules that
encourage investment 
and sustained upgrading (e.g.,
Intellectual property protection)

Meritocratic incentive systems 
across institutions
Open and vigorous competition
among locally based rivals

Factor (Input) Conditions 

Presence of high quality, specialized
inputs available to firms
Human resources
Capital resources
Physical infrastructure
Administrative infrastructure
Information infrastructure
Scientific and technological
infrastructure
Natural resources

Demand Conditions

Sophisticated and demanding
local customer(s)
Local customer needs that
anticipate those elsewhere
Unusual local demand in 
specialized segments that 
can be served nationally 
and globally

Related and Supporting 
Industries
Access to capable, locally
based suppliers and firms in 
related fields
Presence of clusters instead
of isolated industries

18In a Global World :

‚Ä¢‚ÄØ The cost of distance is so low that it ‚Ä¶ 
‚Ä¢‚ÄØ Eliminates the profitability of arbitraging things that are easy to move 
‚Ä¢‚ÄØ
Increases the intensity of global competition and transnational production 
‚Ä¢‚ÄØ Traditional sources of superior performance (such as scale or low labor cost) 
become requirements for normal performance (that is, for competitive parity, 
not competitive advantage) 
 
‚Ä¢‚ÄØ Competitive advantage is primarily based on knowledge (skills, 
technologies, user experience, ‚Ä¶) and other 
* intangibles 
(reputation, culture, institutions) that are very hard to move or 
copy.  
 
‚Ä¢‚ÄØ Knowledge (of the ‚Äúhard to move‚Äù kind) is increasingly dispersed 
around the(cid:90)(cid:82)rld
