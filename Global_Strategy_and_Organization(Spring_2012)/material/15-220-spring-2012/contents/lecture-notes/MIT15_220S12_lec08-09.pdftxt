*More of one increases the return of more of the other. So, if A and B are complements, both [low 
A, low B] and [high A, high B] will exhibit positive outcomes (higher vpc for different market 
segments, for example) and (low, high) combinations will exhibit negative outcomes (lower vpc) – 
recall the pianist-violinist analogy.

* Company or “business unit”. The expression We in the elements above means the company” or business unit.  
NB. If you manage a unit, then the rest of your company is part of the Environment of your unit.

13Elements of company performance  

-  Environment: the company’s customers and its shareholders; its suppliers, 
competitors, partners, …; and society, the national or international context of 
its activities. Such context exhibits not only physical, institutional, 
technological, and cultural properties, but also a particular history – i.e., a 
given “PITCH”.  
 
(Business) Strategy: the company’s offerings (good and services) and 
position (value propositions) in its target markets, its set of activities (its 
“business model”) and resource allocation. This is the real or actual 
“business strategy” of the company – hence, what the company does and 
how it does it – and should not be confused with the planned or intended 
strategy.

14A model of Organization
 

 
 

  
(Sour  ce: Santos, forthcoming 2012) 
 

For the Sloan Fellows - © Jose Santos, 2012 

 - “People” is the set of individuals in the organization, with their individual traits, style, experience and skills. It 
includes particularly all its managers: the general manager (“CEO”), the top management team and the other managers. If we 
take the whole organization, it will include also the other employees , and even outsourcing agents that are closely 
intertwined with the people of the organization in their daily activities.  
 

 - “Managerial Mindset”  refers to the principles, values and frames of reference shared by the general 
manager (“CEO”) and the management team. The “purpose” of the company, its “vision”, and its “goals” are elements of the 
“managerial mindset” and express the intent and dreams of the management team. The “managerial mindset” determines 
what is right, good, and beautiful for the organization – and therefore guides the managers in their choices. 
 

 - “Structure” is the organizational structure, i.e. the differentiation of roles, location, information, and authority 
(decision rights) and their integration through a number of coordination and control mechanisms. The structure includes the 
pattern of relations between the individuals and units that make up the organization, be it the formal relations (the “org 
chart”) and the informal relations (the “network”). 
 

 - “Processes” include, in general, the decision making processes in the organization, be it resource allocation 
(budgeting, headcount and capex planning,…), conflict resolution, and the handling of exceptions. Specifically, it includes 
information processes and people processes. (N.B. These are the processes that make the organization be (the “physiology” of 
the organization), not the activities/processes that are elements of “Strategy”(such as delivering a solution to a client).  
 

 - “Performance Metrics” is the set of indicators (quantitative and qualitative) used in the company to measure 
the individual, unit, and organization level performance.    
 

 - “Incentives” include the instruments of recognition, retribution, and motivation of managers -- and other 
employees -- for their own performance: the salaries and equivalent; the bonus systems and other special  rewards; and the 
career and promotion rules.

N.B. 1. There are several systemic models of “Organization”, each giving special emphasis to particular elements. I developed the 
model above to focus on managerial intervention, but you can use another model – for example, the “PARC” model (by Roberts) or 
the model built in the 7Ss (by Waterman et al, aka the “McKinsey model”) or in the “STAR” (by Galbraith).  
 
N.B. 2. I developed and depict the model this way in order to signify the critical role of the “right side” (Mindset, Processes, 
Incentives) in global integration.
