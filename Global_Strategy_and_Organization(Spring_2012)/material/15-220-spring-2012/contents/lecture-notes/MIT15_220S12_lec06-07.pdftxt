The Strategy of the MNC as Multinational
 
 
 
1)	  The multinational company (MNC) is particular because its organization spans different countries, not because it 
 
 
 
does business in different countries. The MNC is a multi-unit hierarchy with units in two or more countries. 
Managing in a MNC is particular in that one manages with, and for different peoples in their respective 
   
 
 
national contexts. 
 
2)	  The strategy of a MNC as a MNC has to include an organizational value proposition. Any description of a MNC 
 
 
strategy without such organizational element is incomplete. This MNC-specific strategy element has for long been 
 
  
established as “global integration.” 
 
“National responsiveness” and “global integration” constitute the two fundamental factors of the economic (value 
 
 
 
created) and financial (value captured) performance of the MNC. 
 
 
“National responsiveness” refers to how the MNC responds to the economic, political, and organisational forces 
 
 
that arise from the differences and similarities across nations. National responsiveness choices are content 
 
choices embodied in two kinds of specialization. One is “local specialization” (or “local adaptation” or 
 
 
“localization”): the extent to which the product and the activities of the MNC in each country are specific to the 
 
national context there (i.e. dependent on the local “pitch” and applied only there). Local specialization optimizes local 
 
 
 
 
 
performance (say, the country unit P. & L.). The other is “international specialization”: the extent to which locally 
 
 
specific product features and activities in a particular country apply to the world or to a set of countries. 
International specialization optimizes local and global performance. For example, if a MNC decides to have a 
 
 
 
 
“center of excellence” of design in Milano, Italy for Europe, that is “international specialization” there; if the same 
 
 
 
MNC decides that its products for Italy will be branded with Italian names, that is “local specialization." 
 
 
 
 
“Global integration” determines the overall (global) organization of the MNC. The global integration of a MNC 
 
 
 
reflects the value of the union of the country units that constitute the MNC. Global integration is not – at all – the 
 
 
extent (let alone the increase) of similarity or standardization across country units in the MNC. Choices of 
similarities and differences are “national responsiveness” choices. 
 
 
 
6)	  Note that the local organizational choices in each country unit of a MNC depend also on its global integration. 
 
 
 
Only if global integration is zero (the MNC is a pure portfolio of country-business units) would the local 
 
 
organization in each country be a consequence of the business strategy there (i.e. the local unit of the MNC would 
 
 
be equivalent to a local indigenous company).

The two dimensions above define the strategy of a multinational company as multinational. 
IKEA, for example, has a business strategy: it is furniture retailer, with a particular offering and a unique 
business model. But IKEA has a multinational strategy too: high in “global integration” and low in “national 
responsiveness” (or “local adaptation” or “localization”).

2) 

 
1)  As the world becomes globally integrated, so does the production and delivery of many goods and services. The 
“global supply chain” is now a common feature in many industries. “Made in the World” is becoming the norm. 
 
Printed on the back of an iPhone, you will read: “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China”. Implicit is 
 
 
the statement that the various components are made in many countries. The iPhone is a good instance of national 
 
specialization along the value chain. 
 
In the case of apparel, Li & Fung is one remarkable instance of an innovative global business model that relies on 
 
 
the global integration of production activities by local companies. Li & Fung’s part is to locally differentiate and 
 
 
 
globally coordinate and control the whole process (what the company calls “orchestration”). This model can be 
 
 
replicated in many other businesses. Apparel was a good candidate to begin with, for it is a very mature business 
 
with international trade involved for over one century. Note that the business of Li & Fung is not “international 
 
 
 
trade” (nothing new there) but rather “international management.” This is the novelty. A relatively small 
 
 
multinational company “manages” the business of thousands of local companies around the world. In the past, 
 
 
such activity would have very high transaction costs and, if it had existed, it would be inside a large multinational 
 
company, not in a global world. The more global the world, the less important multinational companies will be in 
 
 
 
 
terms of numbers of employees and value of fixed assets. In a global world, even local companies will have a 
 
 
 
global strategy within a global network of partnerships. This still has a long way to go, but is one way. 
 
 
 
 
3)  The Renault-Nissan alliance provides yet another model of global integration, in this case through a strategic 
 
 
alliance between two large MNCs from distinct countries. 
  
 
4)  However, just a couple of decades ago, the norm for multinational companies (MNCs) was not “global integration” 
 
 
 
but “local autonomy” in the the so-called “multinational” or “multidomestic” model, in which country subsidiaries 
 
were rather self-sufficient and geared towards the optimization of local performance (e.g., country P&L). The high 
 
 
autonomy of many local units made them known as “fiefdoms” and the respective country managers were 
 
“barons.” Several MNCs spoke of their worldwide “federation” of national units with pride. They saw the world as 
 
 
 
a portfolio of country markets. 
 
5)  The global integration “of production and delivery” started early for some companies. Some GIEs (“globally 
 
integrated enterprises”, as IBM’s CEO Sam Palmisano called them) were already visible in the 80s. As one might 
 
predict, the “GIE” movement began in industries with high economies of scale in R&D and manufacturing: cars, 
 
consumer electronics, and semiconductors, just to name a few.

10Global Integration: The value propositions
 
 
 
 

 
1)	  Global integration is not equally advantageous to all companies in all businesses. One needs to assess the 
 
 
 
economic and financial value of global integration, for the cost of global integration is granted and noticeable 
 
 
 
  
(namely for the multi-domestic MNC). There is no benchmark here. However, if the extra value of global 
integration is not substantial (say, 15% or more of your top line), it may be wiser to reconsider it. However, 
 
failure to globally integrate may simply mean going out of business, in which case it becomes an imperative, not 
 
an option. When estimating the value propositions of global integration, the base case is the same MNC with 
autonomous country subsidiaries. 
 
 
2)	  High global integration brings added value to customers or users (and higher “willingness to pay”) because of one 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or more of the following factors: market specialisation; proximity to customers; integrity; and serving global 
 
customers. 
 
3)	  The active proximity to local customers is particularly valuable during customer acquisition, business negotiation, 
 
and delivery, more noticeably in the provision of services and solutions. Behaving like a drone will not satisfy a 
 
local customer that values a supplier that is “easy to work with”, flexible and able to perform real time 
 
 
adjustments. If the MNC supplier is seen as distant or slow, this will easily generate a perception of unreliability 
 
and turn into loss of business. However, this is valid for all MNCs as suppliers, globally integrated or not. What the 
 
globally integrated MNC can achieve by being proximate to its local customers is to access the knowledge of users 
 
 
in the product’s lead country market, even tacit and locally-specific knowledge, as well as to learn how to respond 
 
 
to the most demanding customers in the world and convey such knowledge internally to its other units around 
the world. In both cases this will potentially turn into differentiated offerings and superior value proposition to 
 
local customers everywhere. For example, an integrated MNC can augment their offering to a local customer by 
 
 
throwing in the role of international knowledge broker. Accenture, for example, can benefit a local ERP 
 
 
implementation by adding the knowledge it gained from its experience of similar implementations in more 
advanced contrives in the client’s industry with due respect for third-party IP. This will most likely increase the 
 
performance of the client, or be perceived as such. Local suppliers or local units of non-integrated MNCs can’t 
 
 
easily offer that.

4)	 

Local units should be specialists of local demand and be intimate with local lead users, local demanding customers 
 
 
 
 
 
and local non-customers. Such local market knowledge (for example, what product attributes local customers 
 
 
 
value more and value less, now and tomorrow) is then brought into the product design and development 
processes together with that from colleagues from other country markets. It is this comparative and parallel 
 
 
process of product design and development that will optimize the value for the various local customers while 
 
 
aggregating those features that are commonly shared across borders (the “global product platform”, as is called 
 
 
 
in some industries). A product is no longer the ad-hoc adaptation of a home-based design to each local market (a 
 
sequential process, regularly sub-optimal), but a globally integrated design. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5)  Integrity and reputation are valuable in all businesses and paramount in some, be it goods such as 
 
pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, or cars, or services such as healthcare, auditing, or corporate banking. This 
 
 
 
is not new in a global world. What is new is that an incident anywhere, even in a small and remote location of the 
 
 
 
planet, will quickly be turned into worldwide news. Customer trust and investor goodwill everywhere can be lost in 
a blink of an eye. Just recall that Arthur Andersen, an old, large and highly respected auditing firm by all over the 
 
 
 
world, disappeared in a fortnight after the Enron imbroglio, which was traced to a failure by a relatively small 
office in Texas – of which most partners around the world had never heard of before. The recent BP disaster in 
the Gulf of Mexico is another case in point – and the BP chief executive had never heard of that platform either. 
 
 
This has a direct bearing on global integration, for both local failures and ineffective responses are indicators of a 
non-globally integrated organisation, particularly one where local performance optimization is managed 
 
 
 
 
irrespective of global risk, and where global compliance and global oversight are lacking. Arthur Andersen and BP 
are exemplary in these respects too; in the instances above, and given the high status and businesses of the two 
 
 
institutions, what the world did not forgive was the obvious lack of compliance with professional and safety 
  
norms. “One for all” is even more effective in the negative. 
 
 
6)	  A global customer finds value in a MNC supplier that is equally integrated or more so. The particular needs of a 
globally integrated customer include the coordination of procurement and delivery across borders, joint worldwide 
 
capacity, logistics planning and review meetings, flexibility in delivery locations, worldwide quality assurance, 
global service levels, and, not least, global pricing agreements. A non-integrated MNC supplier is disruptive to a 
 
 
MNC customer in the process of integrating as the supplier local units will act as centrifugal forces to the 
 
 
 
customer local units.

12Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
 
 
 

 
7)	  High global integration brings lower costs because of the following factors: specialization; scale; scope (across 
 
 
 
 
countries); and flexibility. 
 
 
8)	  The international  specialization of operations brings lower costs through two direct efficiency effects. Focusing a 
 
plant or a service center on a particular product for a set of countries, even the whole world, brings faster 
 
 
accumulated experience, a “learning curve” effect. But it also allows for a unit’s location choice that will optimize 
 
the local availability of world-class technicians and workers, suppliers, and knowledge spillovers from similar local 
 
units, a “cluster” effect. Furthermore, the MNC can learn first-hand experientially where in the world are the 
more technically savvy, capable and efficient suppliers, R&D institutes, banks, consultants, and so on. Such deep 
 
access to superior technologies and other inputs will not only provide for the continuous improvement of the 
MNC’s operations and product offering everywhere, but even bring about new breakthrough products. 
 
9)	  Global integration allows for the geographical concentration of operations. This will bring about larger economies 
 
 
 
 
of scale than even the largest country market affords (technology permitting). Historically, the Japanese MNCs in 
cars and consumer electronics that grew to prominence in the 80s (such as Toyota, Sony, or Matsushita/ 
 
Panasonic) took great cost advantage from their “export-model”, often based on a single plant in Japan producing 
 
for the whole world. Their Western competitors, established MNCs, had a large number of plants around he world, 
 
sometimes producing for one country only – the legacy of a non-global world. Such impact of economies of scale 
 
and lower prices in the growth of Japanese MNCs in such industries (at the expense of famous local and 
 
international brands such as Volvo, Rover, RCA, Philips, and many more) prompted scale to become the most 
obvious and popular effect of globalization. Bargaining power with suppliers is steeply increased by buying at a 
multi-country level. Economies of scale in R&D are also very relevant in industries such as chemicals, 
 
semiconductors, or pharmaceuticals, where product differentiation across countries is minimal – and which were 
among the first industries to become “global.” (“R&D intensity,” the ratio of R&D expenditures over sales, is one 
of the accepted measures of an industry’s propensity to globally integrate.)

13Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
 
 
 

 
10)	  However, the more specific efficiency effect of global integration lies in economies of scope across countries. Such 
 
 
international scope in the MNC can easily be confused with scale. Economies of scope derive from the use of the 
 
same asset to produce two (or more) different products or activities. Economies of scale come from it producing 
twice or more of the amount of one product or activity. The confusion between scope and scale in the MNC 
 
comes from the fact that “global markets” are rare, and therefore most goods and services are somewhat locally 
adapted. Such localization in a non-global world meant one factory per country with local scale. In a global world, 
 
 
 
it means one factory capable of producing several country variations of the product. There will be economies of 
 
 
scale in the production of the common parts or “global platform” of the product, and economies in scope in the 
 
rest of the product. However, if one considers the economics of the whole product, then what we should 
account for are economies of scope across countries, for that is the source of variation. If one repeatedly 
focuses on economies of scale, there may be the usual and uncalled for confusion between aggregation and 
 
integration, the belief that globalization requires standardization of the product across borders. The potential for 
 
economies of scope is yet very large in all functions and tasks, including management. Many MNCs have now 
 
dispensed of country head offices, and one regional office manages selected activities in a number of countries. 
 
 
Again, note that overseeing sales in Spain and Portugal are not the same activity (local languages differ, labour 
 
 
 
and commercial law are different, buying patterns are different, and so on). One should not state that a central 
office in Madrid for the whole of the Iberian Peninsula provides an economy of scale across the two countries – 
 
what it constitutes are economies of international scope. For what has happened in some cases is that the Madrid 
office starts to treat sales in Spain and Portugal as if the two were the same. The corollary is poorer top line 
 
 
performance, usually superior to the realized economies of scale (literally, in such case…). 
     
 
 
11) Flexibility across borders is a particular source of lower costs or higher returns in the integrated MNC. There are 
two sources of advantage here. One is the flexibility of diverting operations to another country unit in the 
 
 
 
presence of local surges in demand, local shortages of inputs, or local disasters. The other is the arbitrage of 
factor costs, namely on the price of inputs that are immobile or non-tradable across borders, such as energy 
 
prices, labour rates, tax rates, licensing rights, or exchange rates. The ability to draw on flexibility in the MNC calls 
for redundant capacity by design; worldwide information on current capacity utilization, short term requirements, 
 
 
 
 
and factor prices; as well as suppleness in capacity planning and procurement routines across countries. Flexibility 
 
in the MNC also reduces the bargaining power of local unions as the threat of activities being sent abroad is 
credible. Unions have responded by coordinating their actions across countries (globalization is for all...).

14Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
 
 
 

 
12)	  High global integration also brings a higher value captured though higher price because of higher willingness-to-
 
 
pay and superior ability to compete globally. 
 
 
 
 
13) 	  Industrial economists were among the first to look into how competition would change in an open world. Take the 
 
 
 
 
popular “five forces” model by economist Michael Porter. If the forces that matter in one industry are all by local 
 
 
agents (suppliers, buyers, rival incumbents, new entrants, and substitutes), then the industry will behave as a 
 
 
domestic industry in different countries (hence, multi-domestic), even in a global world. The global integration 
 
impact on product prices and on factor prices will be zero or very small. However, if one or more forces have 
international reach, then the industry is “global.” The case of multipoint competition is illustrative. Company A 
 
competes with company B in country X and in country Y. If A lowers the price in X and forces B to lose an 
important deal there, then B can lower its prices in Y to cause even greater damage to A. The country manager 
 
of A in Y won’t know what hit him, and may not even suspect that the cause of such loss was an act by his 
 
colleague managing A in X. In an industry where incumbents reach internationally, global integration keeps the 
average price higher by coordinating pricing within the company across countries and by stopping or minimizing 
 
 
 
 
local competitive races to the bottom. Another instance: facing up to a powerful international buyer or supplier 
 
 
will imply coordinated sales or purchasing negotiations across countries. A non-integrated MNC supplier will have 
lower bargaining power when facing a more integrated MNC customer, who can better gather and put to use 
 
information about the procured product market conditions, pricing and terms around the world. 
 
 
 
 
 
14) 	  Higher average price will also result from a higher willingness-to-pay by local and global customers that will value 
   
 
 
the global positioning of the MNC as we saw above with the customer value proposition of global integration. 
 
 
15) 	  The coordination and control of sales and prices across borders inside the MNC can also keep the world average 
 
price higher by eliminating or minimising the viability of grey-trade (when a local customer buys from a 
 
 
MNC and is able to re-sell the same goods in another country in competition with the same MNC or its official 
 
 
 
 
distributor there). These practices usually fall under local and international competition laws.

15Global Integration: The value propositions (cont.)
 
 
 
 

 
16)	  A note on the transfer of “best-practices”: The international transfer of best-practices is not a trademark of the 
 
 
 
 
globally integrated MNC. Any local unit of any MNC or even any local company can benefit from sourcing 
knowledge abroad. Such transfer is difficult and costly anyway because of the messy and sticky nature of 
knowledge (for example, technical know-how and operational skills are markedly tacit and context-specific). 
 
 
However, global integration creates the conditions for superior transfer of best-practices in two ways. Even before 
 
 
the transfer begins, the receiving unit must be aware of the very existence of the different practice abroad and 
whether it constitutes a best-practice. And then it must be able to source it, which may simply be impossible or 
very costly if the IP is owned by a competitor. The globally integrated MNC addresses these access difficulties by 
institutionalizing internal contests and exhibitions of best-practices, technical steering committees, cross-country 
 
 
functional teams, centers of excellence, and through the mutual visits of local managers around the world or via 
 
 
 
the information exchange at the eGLT. We also know that the transfer of best-practices depends on the 
absorptive capacity and motivation (the “skill and will”) of the receiving unit, and on the quality of relations 
 
 
between the sending and receiving units. Again, the global integrated MNC fosters a corporate context in which 
such factors can be addressed with team spirit across countries, complemented with training in-context and 
 
special performance appraisal metrics and incentives. So, the transfer of best practices is not specific to global 
 
 
integration, but a globally integrated MNC can benefit from a more effective and efficient transfer of best-
practices across its units around the world. Therefore, global integration causes a better performing transfer of 
 
best-practices.  
 
17) 	  And what about risk? Global integration may sharply increase economic performance and financial returns, but it 
 
 
will also increase risk. The multi-local MNC diversifies country risk, the globally integrated company amplifies 
 
 
enterprise risk. That is the hallmark of interdependence. What happens anywhere can affect everywhere. Note 
that the root cause of such added risk is the “global world” we live in. Even a multi-local company can suffer from 
 
 
the domino-effect of a failure across countries. What is special about the global integrated MNCs is that structural 
 
 
 
choices made by the company render its units in each country dependent on units in other countries, irrespective 
of what happens in the world. An operational failure in one country may turn into higher costs in many countries. 
 
A global customer poorly served in one country may react everywhere. The internal and external global risk 
 
 
 
 
amplification may produce very nasty effects, as the recent Toyota’s “sudden acceleration” case shows.
