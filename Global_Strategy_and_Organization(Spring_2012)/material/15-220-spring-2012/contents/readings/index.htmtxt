This subject draws on a mix of time-tested, current and forward-looking
materials. The frameworks and models for the subject are drawn from various
authors including Bartlett &amp; Ghoshal; Doz, Santos &amp; Williamson;
Ghemawat; Johanson &amp; Vhalne; Lessard; and Porter. We selected a set of case
studies of companies from different origins, different industries, and
different ages. These are well-known companies and industries, and this should
allow us to focus on their internationalization, global strategy and
organization. Other companies will be used as examples during class sessions.
                                                                            Course readings.
