3.  Spatial representations 
a.  Finite difference schemes (truncated Taylor expansion at J grid-points) 
b.  Spectral techniques (express variables using truncated series of N orthogonal 
harmonic functions and solve for N coefficients of expansion;) see 
c.  Interpolation schemes (interpolates between grid points e.g. using a polynomial) 
d.  Finite element schemes (minimizes error between actual and approximate 
solutions using a “basis function”, good for irregular geometries, c.f. (b) above 
which is good for regular geometries)
