*A superscript a or superscript f denotes respectively the value before (f) or after 
(a) an update of an estimate using measurements, and k denotes the 
measurement number. In general, errors are assumed random with zero mean 
and measurement and estimation errors are uncorrelated.

The inferred circa-1998 OH minimum coincides with massive
global wildfires and a strong El Nino.

COMPARED TO PREVIOUS ESTIMATES:

(1) ENERGY RELATED EMISSIONS SMALLER (RUSSIAN GAS LEAKS?)
(2) RICE RELATED EMISSIONS LARGER (PROXIMAL WETLANDS 
OR TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS?)
