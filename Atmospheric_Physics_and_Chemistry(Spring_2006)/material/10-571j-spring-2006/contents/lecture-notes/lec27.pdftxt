MIT JOINT PROGRAM ON THE
SCIENCE & POLICY OF
GLOBAL CHANGE

Founded in 1991
Seed support from MIT
Now Supported by  5 federal
Agencies, a consortium of  21 
Industries, and a Foundation 
Discovery of new interactions among natural
and human climate system components
Objective assessment of uncertainty in economic
and climate projections
Critical and quantitative analysis of 
policy proposals
Understanding connections to other science
and policy issues (e.g. air pollution)

The major analytical tool of the Global Change Joint 
Program is the Integrated Global System Model (IGSM)

Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change

HOW ACCURATE ARE CLIMATE FORECASTS?

THE MAJOR CLIMATE 
FORECAST MODEL 
UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVE 
CLOUDS, OCEAN MIXING
& AEROSOL FORCING.

THESE UNCERTAINTIES ARE 
CONSTRAINED BY 
OBSERVATIONS
ADDED TO THESE
ARE SUBSTANTIAL
UNCERTAINTIES
IN EMISSION
FORECASTING

THESE UNCERTAINTIES
SERIOUSLY LIMIT THE
ACCURACY OF 
PREDICTIONS OF 
FUTURE CLIMATE

WE USE VERY LARGE 
ENSEMBLES OF IGSM 
RUNS TO ESTIMATE THE 
PROBABILITY OF 
VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE
