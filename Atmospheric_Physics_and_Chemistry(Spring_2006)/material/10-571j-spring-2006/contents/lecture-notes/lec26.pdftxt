Conclusions

•

•

•

•

Global oceanic sources decrease slightly from 26% 
(GEIA, 1995) to 22%;
Southern oceanic sources decease substantially from 
12% to 0.6% while the tropical oceans increases from 
10% to 19%
South Asia sources are almost doubled compared to 
the bottom up method (GEIA, 1995), could be due to 
the increased soil fertilization in this area and still on-
going deforestation. 
By semi-hemisphere, southern extra-tropical sources 
decrease from 14% to 3% largely due to the big oceanic 
source reduction in this area; while the northern tropical 
N2O sources increase from 34 to 58%
