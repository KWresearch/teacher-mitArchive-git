a.	 Finite difference schemes (truncated Taylor expansion at J grid-points) 
b.	 Spectral techniques (express variables using truncated series of N orthogonal 
harmonic functions and solve for N coefficients of expansion;) see 
c.	
Interpolation schemes (interpolates between grid points e.g. using a polynomial) 
d.	 Finite element schemes (minimizes error between actual and approximate 
solutions using a “basis function”, good for irregular geometries, c.f. (b) above 
which is good for regular geometries)

Time stepping and stability

Time stepping and stability
In the numerical model, time is  treated in discrete units and the time intervals 
chosen depend on the size of the model grid boxes. Intuitively, don’t want to 
transport across more than a grid cell over a time step. 
General Rule for stability: the CFL condition 

u t∆ 
∆x 

≤ 1


∆x 

u∆t 

e.g. Typically in the atmosphere, max u 
= 100m/s & grid spacing 
= 200 km, so constraint is 
Δt < 2000 seconds (33min)

(c)  For higher order accuracy than above schemes (which are first order accurate) use 
predictor-corrector methods (e.g. Gear) or generalized Runga-Kutta (e.g. Kaps-
Rentrop).  These methods are however generally too computationally demanding 
for 3D chemical transport models.

(e)  Negative mixing ratios/concentrations.  Whenever  X i  < 0  (nonphysical!) then 
need to replace by  X i  = 0  and lower either adjacent (grid-point) or global
