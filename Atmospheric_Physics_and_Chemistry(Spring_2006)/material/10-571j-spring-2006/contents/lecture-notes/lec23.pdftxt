Handling Model and Calibration Errors In Inversions

Method 1
Define H = Ht + He
Determine He from multiple runs of different models 
Increase measurement error by He xt
Method 2
As in Method 1, but simply run the filter for an ensemble
of different H matrices from different models  and observation 
vectors (y0) with different calibrations chosen to 
have equal probability (Monte Carlo)
Method 3
Use the state-space evolution equation ( x(t)=M(t)x(t-1) + n(t))
and compute Q=E(nnT) from multiple model H values.

METHANE INVERSE STUDIES USING MATCH

• High-Frequency (13:AGAGE,CMDL,etc) and Flask (41
comprehensive & 32 more intermittent:CMDL,CSIRO,etc.)
monthly mean observations between 1996-2001

• Interannually varying transport (NCEP) used in 3D MATCH 
model to create the CH4 response of each site to monthly
pulses from individual regional processes (sensitivity matrix)

• Kalman Filter used to solve for:
7  Seasonally-varying processes as monthly varying fluxes
3  Pseudo-steady processes as constant fluxes
using annually repeating time/space varying model OH tuned
to AGAGE CH3CCl3 observations

Emissions from
seven seasonally
varying (3 wetland,
3 burning, rice) &
two steady sources
(animals & waste, 
coal & gas) to be
optimally estimated 
as amendments to
the (a priori)
reference

The inverse method
uses the transition 
matrix (M) to remove 
each monthly flux 
after it has been 
estimated for 12 
months in the state 
vector, and adds the 
latest monthly 
flux to be estimated
