Problem 1 

Say you are downwind from a large SO2 “source region” in which the SO2 
concentration [SO2] (0) is 3 x 1011 molecule cm–3 in the lowest h kilometers and zero 

above that. There are no additional sources between you and this source region and the 

wind vector is horizontal (x direction) and constant in time. Assume that SO2 is removed 

by reaction with OH in the gas phase to produce H2SO4. Derive a formula for P (= the 

rate of production per unit area of H2SO4) in the downwind region as a function of h, τ = 

SO2 chemical lifetime = 1/l [OH] [M], l = third order rate constant, u = wind speed, and x 

= distance from source region. State briefly the major assumptions used in deriving your 

formula. 

Graph P as a function of x from 0 km to 1000 km from the source for u = 3.3 

m/sec, h = 1.9 km, l = 2 x 10–31 cm6 molecule–2 sec–1, and [OH] = 2 x 106 radicals cm–3. 

Compare this P graph to that computed for u = 7 m/sec and comment on the difference. 

Problem 2 

In mid-1992 the CFCl3 and CF2Cl2 mole fractions at and below 15 km altitude were 298 x 
10–12 molecules/cm3 and 521 x 10–12 molecules/cm3, respectively. You are given the 
following:

By solving the steady-state horizontally-averaged continuity equations for each species in 
each atmospheric layer compute and graph their mixing ratios as a function of altitude. 
(Assume H = 7.8 km at all altitudes.) 

Problem 3 

You are constructing a 3-D tropospheric chemical transport model and have chosen grid 
spacings of 150 km in the horizontal and 1.6 km in the vertical and a time step consistent 
with a Courant number of 0.1.  Typical wind velocities are 3.2 m/sec in the horizontal and 
0.7 cm/sec in the vertical.  Also, [O3] ~ 1012 cm-3, [0H] ~ 106 cm-3 (daytime only), [M] ~ 
1.7 x 1019 cm-3, and T ~ 276 K.  Consider the following reactions whose approximate rate 
constants are given in parentheses: 

CO + OH → CO2  + H 
NO2  + OH + M →  HNO3  + M 
NO2  + hv → NO +O 
NO + O3 → NO2  + O2 
CH3CCl3  + OH → CH2CCl3  +H2O 
CH4  + OH → CH3  + H2O 
CH3CHCH2  + OH →  C3H5  + H2O 

(2 x 10-13 cm3/sec) 
(2.5 x 10-30 (T/300)–2.9 cm6/sec) 
(10-12  sec-1, daytime) 
(2 x 10-12 exp (-1400/T) cm3/sec) 
(1.75 x 10-12 exp (-1550/T) cm3/sec) 
(2.9 x 10-12 exp (-1820/T) cm3/sec) 
(2.6 x 10-11 cm3/sec) 

(a)  For each of the gases CO, NO, NO2, CH3ClCl3, CH4 and CH3CHCH2, compute their 
chemical lifetimes and thus determine whether transport must be considered or whether a 
pure photochemical steady state (chemical production=chemical loss) can be assumed. 
Form chemical families where appropriate. 

(b)  A steady horizontal wind with a speed of 4.1 m/sec is blowing directly from an urban 
source region to a rural observing site 400 km downwind.  The concentration of the 
gaseous hydrocarbon propene (CH3CHCH2) is observed to be 19 times less at the rural 
observing site than at the urban source region.  Given the rate constant for reaction of OH 
with propene is 2.6 x 10-11 cm3/sec, and assuming that this reaction is the only destruction 
mechanism for propene, calculate the average concentration of OH in the region between 
the source and observing site. 

Using this calculated [OH] and the rate constants for reactions with OH from part (a), 
compute the factors by which the concentrations at the source and observing site will 
differ for CO, NO2, CH3CCl3, and CH4 (assume the air temperature T ~ 292K).
