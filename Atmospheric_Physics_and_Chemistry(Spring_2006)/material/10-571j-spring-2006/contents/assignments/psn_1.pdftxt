Problem 1.1 – The Kyoto Protocol and its Relevance to Urban Air Pollution 

In class we have been discussing air pollution problems that range  in scales from  local to 
global.  At  present  much  of  the  discussion  in  newspapers,  radio  and  TV  is  about  global 
climate  and  in  particular  about  the  impact  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2).  Prepare  a  one  page 
summary  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  be  sure  to  address  its  organizational  form, who  are  the 
signatories, what  emission  control options are being proposed  etc. Once you understand 
the  protocol  discuss  its  relevance  to  solving  urban  scale  photochemical  air  pollution 
problems.  Please  include  the  appropriate  citations  to  web  sites,  papers,  books  that  you 
use to prepare you memorandum. 

Problem 1.2 – Combustion Chemistry and Air Quality Standards 

The balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of a general hydrocarbon 
fuel CxHy  is given by  
⎛ 
C H y  + ⎜ x + 
x 
⎝ 

y
⎞
⎟ O2  → xCO   +  H  O  
2 2

⎠

y

(a) If 1.0 mole of  CxHy is completely burned, show that 3.7[x + (y/4)] moles of 
(unreacting) nitrogen will be contained in the emissions.  Hence, write an expression, in 
terms of x and y, for the total number of moles of gases in the emissions. 

(b) In reality, combustion in cars converts all of the hydrogen in the fuel to H2O and all of 
the carbon in the fuel to varying amounts of CO2 and CO depending on the availability of 
oxygen. If a fraction f of the CxHy is provided in excess of that required for complete 
combustion, derive an expression in terms of f, x, and y for the mole fraction of CO in the 
emissions (i.e., the ratio of the number of moles iof CO to the total number of moles in the 
emissions).  Assume that oxygen is made available to the fuel at the rate required for 
complete combustion (even though complete combustion is not achieved), and that the 
only effect of the excess CxHy is to add CO to the emissions and to change the amount of 
CO2 emitted. 

(c) Assuming that CH2 is a reasonable approximation for a general hydrocarbon fuel, use 
the result from (b) to determine the concentrations (in ppmv and percent) of CO in the 
emissions from an engine for the following values of f:  0.0010, 0.010, and 0.10. Compare 
these numbers to the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for carbon 
monoxide. 

Problem 1.3 – Wavelength ranges for photolysis 

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are important species that 
participate in the photochemistry occurring in the troposphere. Look up the bond 

Spring 2006 

dissociation energies for N-O, N=O, H-C, C=O,… and then calculate the longest 
wavelength of incoming solar radiation that is likely to cause the molecules to dissociate. 
Compare these wavelength against the quantum yields published in the NASA Kinetics 
report “Chemical Kinetics and Photochemical Data for Use in Atmospheric Studies 
Evaluation Number 14 – what do you conclude? (Report URL is

Problem 1.4 – Photolysis Rate Constants for Formaldehyde 

Formaldehyde  is  an  important  photochemically  active  species  in  the  troposphere.  There 
are two possible photolysis pathways: 

CH O   h  
1→ HCO   H  
+  ν⎯⎯
+
2 
2⎯⎯ +→ CO   H   2 
The reaction rate constant for each of these steps is of the form 
∞ 
∫ 
k j  = σj  λ Φ j λ I λ  λ 
( ) ( )  d
( )  
0 
where σj  is  the  absorption  cross  section, φj  is  the  quantum  yield  and  I  the  actinic  flux. 
Using  the  wavelength  dependent  actinic  flux  data  shown  in  Table  3.4  of  Seinfeld  and 
Pandis  (p.  146)  and  the  absorption  cross  section/quantum  yield  data  from  Table  4.19  in 
the  NASA  Kinetics  report  “Chemical  Kinetics  and  Photochemical  Data  for  Use  in 
Atmospheric  Studies  Evaluation  Number  14  determine  the  photolysis  rate  constants  for 
each  of  these  reactions  at  latitude  40o North  at  noon  on  January  1  and  July  1. What  then 
are  the  characteristic  time  scales  for  these  reactions?  (The  NASA  report  can  be  found  at 
the  following  web  site    - jpldataeval.jpl.nasa.gov/pdf/JPL_02-25_rev02.pdf.  How  do 
these numbers compare to the values shown in Table 5.4 p.297 of Seinfeld and Pandis? 

Problem 1.5 – Estimation of concentration 

If you take a deep breath what is the likelihood that a nitrogen molecule now in your 
lungs was also at one time also in the lungs of Albert Einstein? 

Problem 1.6 – Catalytic Cycles 

One  of  the  earliest  puzzles  of  atmospheric  chemistry  was  to  explain  the  presence  of 
ozone  in  the  stratosphere.  In  1930  Chapman  proposed  a  simple,  four  step,  chemical 
scheme 

O2 + hν⎯⎯ O  O

→ + 
O O2 + M ⎯⎯ +
2→ O   M  
+

O3 + hν⎯⎯ +→ O  O

O O3 ⎯⎯ +
4→ O   O

(a)  Derive the differential equations for the concentration dynamics of each species. 
(b)  Show that [O]+2[O2]+ 3[O3] is constant, why should this result be obvious?

(c)	 Assuming photochemical equilibrium derive an expression  for  the  rate of  change of 
the  concentration  of  [O3]  in  terms  of  the  concentrations  of  atomic  oxygen  [O2]  and 
the third body [M]. 
(d) 	 Using  the  results  from  part  (c)  look  at  the  vertical  profile  of  [O3]  in  Figure  4.6  of 
Seinfeld and Pandis and explain the shape of the vertical ozone distribution. 
(e) 	 While  the  Chapman  mechanism  explains  the  basic  characteristics  of  the  observed 
[O3]  profile  its  predictions  are  too  high  by  about  a  factor  of  2.  There  must  be  other 
loss processes. Typically losses arise from catalytic cycles of the form 
X + O3  ⎯⎯ + 
→ XO O
2
+ ⎯⎯ X O  
XO O   → + 
2
where  X  is  a  free  radical  catalyst  (H,  OH,  NO,  Cl,  or  Br).  Explain  how  these  species 
could catalyze the ozone destruction.
