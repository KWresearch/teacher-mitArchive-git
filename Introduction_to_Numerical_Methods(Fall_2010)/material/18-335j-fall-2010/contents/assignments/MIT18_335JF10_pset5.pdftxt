18.335 Problem Set 5 

Problem 1: 
(a)  Trefethen, 36.3. Plot the error in this eigenvalue 
as  a  function  of  how  many  Ax  matrix-vector 
multiplies  you  perform  (use  a  semilog  or  log-
log  scale  as  appropriate).  (The  ﬁles  lanczos.m 
and  A363.m  posted  on  the  web  page  are  help­
ful.) 

(b)  Same problem, but use restarted Lanczos:  after 
every  10  iterations  of Lanzcos,  restart with  the 
best Ritz vector from those 10 iterations. Again, 
plot the error vs. matrix-vector multiply count. 

(c)  The above questions asked  for  the minimum-λ 
eigenvalue (which may be negative).  Plot what 
happens if, instead, you try to get the minimum­
|λ |  eigenvalue  by  these  techniques.  (Aside:  a 
better  way  is  to  use  Lanczos  on  A−1 ,  but  that 
requires  a  fast way  to  solve  Ax = b  in  order  to 
multiply by A−1 .) 

Problem 2: 
Trefethen,  problem  38.6. 
(The  ﬁles  SD.m  and 
A386.m on the web page are helpful.) 

Problem 3: 
In  problem  3  of  the  Fall  2008  midterm  for  18.335, 
it  was  claimed  that  you  could  use  the  conjugate-
gradient algorithm for a Hermitian positive semidef­
inite matrix A, with a random starting guess, to ﬁnd a 
vector  in  the null  space  (see  the midterm  solutions). 
Demonstrate this by means of an example, in Matlab, 
and plot  the norm of  the residual vs.  iteration.  (You 
can  construct  a  random positive-semideﬁnite matrix 
A via, for example, B=rand(198,200);  A  =  B’  * 
B).
