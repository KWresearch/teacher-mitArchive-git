Simultaneous Inverse  Iteration ⇐⇒  QR Algorithm


•	 Last lecture we showed that “pure” QR  ⇐⇒  simultaneous iteration 

applied to I , and the ﬁrst column  evolves as in power iteration


•	 But it is also equivalent to simultaneous inverse iteration applied to a

I , and the last column evolves as in inverse iteration 

ﬂipped” 
•  To see this, recall that Ak  =  Q(k)R(k)  with

 
k 
Q(j )  =     
� 
j=1 
•  Inver t and use that A−1  is symmetric: 
A−k  =  (R(k) )−1Q(k)T  Q(k) (R(k) )−T 
=

Simultaneous Inverse  Iteration ⇐⇒  QR Algorithm


•  Introduce the “

ﬂipping” 

permutation matrix 


 

 
1 
and rewrite that last expression as 

P  = 

1 

· · · 

 1 
 

 
 

A−kP  = [Q(k)P ][P (R(k) )−T P ] 

•  This is a QR factorization of A−kP , and the algorithm is equivalent to 
simultaneous iteration on A−1 

•  In par ticular, the last column of Q(k)  evolves as in inverse iteration

The Shifted QR Algorithm 


•	 Since the QR algorithm behaves like inverse iteration, introduce shifts µ(k) 
to accelerate the convergence: 

A(k−1)  − µ(k)I Q(k)R(k)
=

A(k)  =  R(k)Q(k)  +  µ(k)I 

•	 We then get (same as before): 

A(k)  = (Q(k) )T A(k−1)Q(k)  = (Q(k) )T AQ(k) 

and (different from before): 

(A − µ(k)I )(A − µ(k−1)I ) · · ·  (A − µ(1)I ) =  Q(k)R(k) 

•  Shifted simultaneous iteration – last  column of Q(k)  converges quickly

Choosing µ(k) :  The Rayleigh Quotient Shift


•	 Natural choice of µ(k) : Rayleigh quotient for last column of Q(k) 

(k)µ = 

(k) 
(k)
(qm  )T Aqm 
(k) 
(k)
(qm  )T qm 

= (q (k) )T Aq (k) 
m 
m

(k)
•	 Rayleigh quotient iteration, last column qm  converges cubically 

•	 Convenient fact:  This Rayleigh quotient appears as m, m  entry of A(k) 
since A(k)  = (Q(k) )T AQ(k) 

(k)
(k)
•	 The Rayleigh quotient shift  corresponds to setting µ =  Amm

Choosing µ(k) :  The Wilkinson Shift


•	 The QR algorithm with Rayleigh quotient shift might fail, e.g. with two 
symmetric eigenvalues 

|δ | + 

µ  =  am  − sign(δ)b2	
m−1	

•	 Break symmetry by the Wilkinson shift

where δ  = (am−1  − am )/2 and B  =  

•	 Always convergence with this shift, in worst case quadratically

A Practical Shifted QR Algorithm 


Algorithm:  “Practical” QR Algorithm 

(Q(0) )T A(0)Q(0)  =  A

A(0)  is a tridiagonalization of A


for k  = 1, 2, . . .

(k−1) 
(k)
Pick a shift µ
e.g., choose µ =  Amm 
Q(k)R(k)  =  A(k−1)  − µ(k)I  QR factorization of A(k−1)  − µ(k)I 
A(k)  R(k)Q(k)  +  µ(k)I
= 

Recombine factors in reverse order 

(k)
If any off-diagonal element Aj,j+1  is sufﬁciently  close to zero, 
set Aj,j+1  =  Aj+1,j  = 0 to obtain

0 
A1 
0  A2 
and now apply the QR algorithm to A1  and A2

Stability and Accuracy


•  The QR algorithm is backward stable: 

Q˜Λ˜ Q˜ T  =  A +  δA,  

�δA�  
�A�


=  O(ǫmachine )

where Λ˜ is the computed Λ and Q˜ is an exactly or thogonal matrix


•  The combination with Hessenberg reduction is also backward stable 

•	 Can be shown (for normal matrices) that |λ˜ j  − λj | ≤ �δA�2 , which gives 

|λ˜ j  − λj | 
�A�


=  O(ǫmachine )

where λ˜ j  are the computed eigenvalues
