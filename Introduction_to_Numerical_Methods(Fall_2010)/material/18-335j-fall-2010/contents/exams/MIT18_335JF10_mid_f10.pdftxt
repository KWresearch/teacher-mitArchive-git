generally a problem for the convergence of this 
algorithm, but λ1 = λ2  is not a problem (assume 
A is diagonalizable). 

(b)  Compare  and  contrast  the  convergence  prop­
erties  and  computational  cost  of  the  following 
two  algorithms  for  computing  the  eigenvalue 
closest  to  µ  of  a  large  sparse  Hermitian  ma­
trix  A,  where  µ  is  in  the  middle  of  the  spec­
trum  somewhere:  Lanczos  for  the  smallest-
magnitude eigenvalue of (A − µ I )2 , or Lanczos 
for  the  largest-magnitude  eigenvalue  of  (A −
µ I )−1 .

Problem 1:  SVD Stability (30 points) 
Consider  the  problem  of  computing  the  SVD  A = 
U ΣV ∗  from a matrix A (the input). 
(a)  Explain  what  it  would  mean  for  this  computa­
tion (outputs U , Σ, and V ) to be backwards sta­
ble. 

(b)  Explain  why  this  algorithm  cannot  be  back­
wards stable.  (Hint:  think about e.g. what prop­
erty the computed U˜ would have to have.) 

(c)  Practical  SVD  algorithms  are,  however,  stable 
(for  the  general  deﬁnition  of  stability).  Write 
down what this means. 

Problem 2: Least squares (30 points) 
Suppose  that  we  want  to  solve  the  weighted  least-
squares problem 
min �B−1 (Ax − b)�2 
x 
where B (m × m)  is a nonsingular square matrix and 
A (m × n) has full column rank. 
(a)  Write down  the  equivalent of  the normal  equa­
tions  (A∗Ax =  A∗b  for  ordinary  least-squares) 
that  the  optimum  x  must  satisfy.  [Reminder: 
from  class,  x∗Cx − x∗ d  − d ∗ x  for  C  =  C∗ 
positive-semideﬁnite  is  minimized  when Cx = 
d .] 

(b)  Give a stable way to solve this that avoids squar­
ing the condition number of A.  (Just re-express 
it  in  terms  of  stable  algorithms  considered  in 
class.  You  don’t  have  to  write  out  the  in-class 
parts  of  the  algorithm,  just  say  “___  factoriza­
tion of ___” etcetera.) 

Problem 3: Eigenvalues (30 points) 
(a)  Recall  the  power  method:	 computing  xn+1  = 
Axn/�Axn�  for  n = 1, 2, . . .,  with  some  random 
x1 ,  which  converges  to  an  eigenvector  q1  cor­
responding  to  the  eigenvalue  λ1  with  largest 
magnitude.  (Number  the  eigenvalues  in  order 
|λ1 | ≥  |λ2 | ≥  · · · .)  Explain  why  |λ1 | = |λ2 |  is
