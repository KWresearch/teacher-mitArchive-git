***** Prerequisites *****
18.06_Linear_Algebra, 18.700_Linear_Algebra and 18.03_Differential_Equationsor
18.034_Honors_Differential_Equations.
***** Topics *****
Advanced introduction to numerical linear algebra and related numerical
methods. Topics include direct and iterative methods for linear systems,
eigenvalue decompositions and QR/SVD factorizations, stability and accuracy of
numerical algorithms, the IEEE floating-point standard, sparse and structured
matrices, and linear algebra software. Other topics may include memory
hierarchies and the impact of caches on algorithms, nonlinear optimization,
numerical integration, FFTs, and sensitivity analysis. Problem sets will
involve use of MATLABÂ® (little or no prior experience required; you will learn
as you go).
***** Required Textbook *****

***** Policies *****
Talk to anyone you want to and read anything you want to, with three
exceptions: First, you may not refer to homework solutions from the previous
terms. Second, make a solid effort to solve a problem on your own before
discussing it with classmates or doing an Internet search. Third, no matter
whom you talk to or what you read, write up the solution on your own, without
having their answer in front of you.
***** Final Projects *****
The final project will be a 5â15 page paper (single-column, single-spaced,
ideally using the style template from the SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis),
reviewing some interesting numerical algorithm not covered in the course.
[Since this is not a numerical PDE course, the algorithm should not be an
algorithm for turning PDEs into finite/discretized systems; however, your
project may take a PDE discretization as a given "black box" and look at some
other aspect of the problem, e.g. iterative solvers.]
