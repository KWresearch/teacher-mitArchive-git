Options for solving Ax=b (m×m)

•	 If m is small (<104), use LAPACK (LU, Cholesky, etc.)

•	 If m is moderate (<107), A is sparse, and A’s sparsity
comes from a mesh (especially 1d or 2d), consider a
sparse-direct solver (UMFPACK, etc.) 
•	 Otherwise, if m is large and Ax is fast: 
–	 if A is Hermitian positive-definite, use conjugate-gradient

–	 if A is Hermitian indefinite: 
•  if not too badly conditioned, use MINRES 
•  otherwise, use SYMMLQ, GMRES, or some other scheme 
–  if A is non-Hermitian, try several possibilities:

~

•	 GMRES if convergence is achieved in <100 steps (e.g. you have a good
preconditioner), otherwise some flavor of restarted GMRES 
•	 QMR (with look-ahead Lanczos) 
•	 BiCGSTAB(ell) with ell=1,2,4,… (ell>1 is most reliable)
