What is the FEM?

FEM: Method for numerical solution of field problems.

Description
- FEM cuts a structure into several elements (pieces of the structure).
- Then reconnects elements at “nodes” as if nodes were pins or drops 
of glue that hold elements together.
- This process results in a set of simultaneous algebraic equations.

Number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF)
Continuum: Infinite

FEM: Finite
(This is the origin of the name, 
Finite Element Method)

“governing equations” and “boundary conditions”

Fundamental Concepts (4)

It is very difficult to solve the algebraic equations for the entire domain 
Divide the domain into a number of small, simple elements

A field quantity is interpolated by a polynomial over an element

Adjacent elements share the DOF at connecting nodes

Finite element: Small piece of structure

Concepts - Summary

- FEM uses the concept of piecewise polynomial interpolation.

- By connecting elements together, the field quantity becomes interpolated 
over the entire structure in piecewise fashion.

- A set of simultaneous algebraic equations at nodes.

Brief History

- The term finite element was first coined by Clough in 1960. In the early 
1960s, engineers used the method for approximate solutions of problems 
in stress analysis, fluid flow, heat transfer, and other areas.

- The first book on the FEM by Zienkiewicz and Chung was published in 
1967.

- In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the FEM was applied to a wide variety 
of engineering problems.

- Most commercial FEM software packages originated in the 1970s.
(Abaqus, Adina, Ansys, etc.)

- Klaus-Jurgen Bathe in ME at MIT

Advantages of the FEM

Can readily handle very complex geometry:
- The heart and power of the FEM

Can handle a wide variety of engineering problems
- Solid mechanics
- Dynamics
- Heat problems
- Electrostatic problems
- Fluids

Can handle complex restraints
- Indeterminate structures can be solved.

Can handle complex loading
- Nodal load (point loads)
- Element loads - distributed (pressure, thermal, inertial forces)
- Time or frequency dependent loading

12

Disadvantages of the FEM

A general closed-form solution, which would permit one 
to examine system response to changes in various 
parameters, is not produced.

The FEM obtains only "approximate" solutions.

The FEM has "inherent" errors.

Mistakes by users can remain undetected.

Mistakes by Users

- Elements are of the wrong type
e.g) Shell elements are used where solid elements are needed

- Distorted elements

- Supports are insufficient to prevent all rigid-body motions

- Inconsistent units (e.g.  E=200 GPa, Force = 100 lbs)

- Too large stiffness differences (cid:198) Numerical difficulties
