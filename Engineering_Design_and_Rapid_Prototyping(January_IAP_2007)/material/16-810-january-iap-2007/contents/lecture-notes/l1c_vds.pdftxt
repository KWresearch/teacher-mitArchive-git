Vehicle Design Summit


The Assisted Human Powered Vehicle 


Vehicle Design Summit Summary


•  Developed 4 alternatively-powered practical vehicle designs with 200 mpg or 
more equivalence 

•  AHPV - Assisted Human Powered Vehicle 

•  Pulse - 1 person all electric commuter vehicle 

•  Fuel Cell - 90% recyclable body and shell 

•  Biofuels - ran on straight vegetable oil 

•  Worked on emerging technologies, in concert with collaborators in industry and 
academia 

AHPV Overview


•  One person commuter vehicle capable of full electric drive, full human drive, & 
everything between 

•  Capable of sustaining 50 mph for >50 miles on one charge 

•  Can both plug in to the grid and charge off of solar power 

•  Substantial autonomous range 

•  500 mpg equivalency @ 35 mph 

•  Safe to drive: visible, good field of view, and crash worthy 

•  Enough storage space for the typical commuter 

•  Must be usable by the 95th percentile human 

What were the goals of the AHPV


•  Breaks new ground in assisted human power: 

•  High sustained speed and a useful range 

•  Capable of making the typical commute autonomously 

•  Generates excitement about alternatives 

•  Demonstrates what college students can do to address major global challenges

The potential uses of the AHPV


•  Commuting / energy conscious personal transportation 

•  Exercise / recreation 

•  Helps to create awareness and stimulate interest energy efficient alternatives 

•  Use in Developing countries 

4 Design Opportunities


•  Solar panel integration 

•  Electric Hub Motor Design 

•  Electric Motor Mechanical Integration 

•  Door and Windshield 

Electric Hub Motor 

Design + Build 

Electric Hub Motor Overview


•  Used frequently in electric bicycles, solar racers, etc 

•  No Gearing, integrated directly into the wheel hub 

•  Extremely High efficiencies (up to 98%) 

•  Limited production volumes in high power ranges (> 2kW) 

•  Expensive (e.g. the NGM motor on the AHPV costs > $8000) 

Electric Hub Motor Goals


•  Design and build a 10kW, 90% efficient Electric Hub Motor that can integrate 
with AHPV 

•  Cost and manufacturing simplicity are key 

•  Interface with standard NGM EV-C200 Motor Controller 

•  Could be the first generation of a motor 
used in VDS 2.0 (full size production-ready 
concept vehicle) 

Electric Hub Motor Teams 


•  Team 1 - Electrical components 

•  Rotor, stator, windings, etc 

•  Responsible for the electrical components 

•  Team 2 - Mechanical integration 

•  Building a housing for the electrical components 

•  Integration with AHPV drivetrain 

Solar Panel Integration Overview 


•  Solar power is a nice concept for vehicle energy, but cannot dynamically meet 
vehicles power needs 

•  However, most cars spend 90+% of each day sitting still.  

•  The AHPV solution: solar panels to recharge the battery while the vehicle is 
sitting outside all day in a parking lot, driveway, etc.  This allows the solar 
panels to “catch up” with the AHPV’s energy needs. 

Solar Panel 
Integration Goals 

•  Design a system that allows the 
solar panels to be deployed to 
face the sun when the AHPV is 
stationary 

•  Must be hand deployable by one 
person in 30 seconds or less 

•  Solar panels cannot be bend. 
The rear of the AHPV has a flat 
surface for storing the panels 
during motion 

Egress, Ingress, and visibility Overview & Goals 

•  The AHPV drives...but there are two main issues 

•  Getting in and out of the vehicle is extremely difficult - there is no door 

•  Visibility is limited for the driver due to small windshield 

Egress, Ingress, and Visibility Goals


•  Design a system of entry and exit for the passenger that allows the passenger 
to be seated in 10 seconds or less 

•  Note here that there are very few hard mounting points suitable for doors in 
the front end of the AHPV. 

•  Is likely to require unusual door configurations 

•  Re-design windshield for better visibility 

The Future of AHPV


•  February - SolidWorks World (New Orleans) 

•  April - Compete in Shell Eco-Marathon (France) 

•  Summer - Museum of Science (Boston)
