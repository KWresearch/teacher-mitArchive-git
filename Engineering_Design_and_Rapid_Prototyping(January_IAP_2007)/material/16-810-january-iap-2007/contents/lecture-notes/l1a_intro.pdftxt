Happy New Year 2007 !

We won’t be designing White Knight or SpaceShipOne this IAP, but ...

You will learn about “the design process” and fundamental 
building blocks of any complex (aerospace) system

Needs – from students

A 2001 survey of undergraduate students 
(Aero/Astro) – in conjunction with new Dept. head 
search
- There is a perceived lack of understanding and training in 
modern design methods using state-of-the-art CAD/CAE/CAM 
technology and design optimization. 

- Individual students have suggested the addition of a short and
intense course of rapid prototyping, combined with design 
optimization.

An engineer should be able to ...

• Determine quickly how things work
• Determine what customers want
• Create a concept
• Use abstractions/math models to improve a concept
• Build or create a prototype
prototype version
• Quantitatively and  robustly test
robustly test a prototype to improve
concept and to predict
• Determine whether customer value and enterprise 
value are aligned (business sense)
• Communicate all of the above to various audiences

• Much of this requires “domain-specific knowledge” and experience
• Several require systems thinking and statistical thinking
• All require teamwork, leadership, and societal awareness

Leads to       Course Objective

Develop a holistic view and initial 
competency in engineering design by  
applying a combination of human creativity 
and modern computational tools to the 
synthesis of a simple component or system.

16.810

11

Mind Map
“Holistic View” - of the
whole. Think about:
- requirements,
design, manufacturing,
testing, cost ...

“Engineering Design”
- what you will likely
do after MIT

16.810

“Human Creativity and
Computational Tools”:
design is a constant inter-
play of synthesis and analysis 

“Competency” - can not
only talk about it or
do calculations, but
actually carry out the
process end-to-end

“Rapid Prototyping” -
a hot concept in
industry today.

“Components / Systems”:
part of all aerospace systems,
But must be “easy” to 
implement in a short time

Learning Objectives

At the end of this class you should be able to …

(1) Carry out a systematic design process from conception through
design/implementation/verification of a simple component or system.

(2) Quantify the predictive accuracy of CAE versus actual test results.

(3) Explain the relative improvement that computer optimization can
yield relative to an initial, manual solution.

(4) Discuss the complementary capabilities and limitations of the
human mind and  the digital computer (synthesis versus analysis).

Learning from Mistakes
(cid:132) Carrying out a full lifecycle creates 
memorable learning experiences
(cid:132) Don’t prevent students from 
making mistakes
(cid:132) Example: bi-wing configuration
(cid:132) Excerpt from Student Reflective 
Memo:
“I learned the value of constantly checking simulations 
against reality …..  My rear-wing design used a biplane 
setup, …due to a huge oversight, the wings were 
actually arranged in an incorrect orientation which 
incurred a large drop in down force.  ….This experience 
taught me a great lesson – always triple check your 
assumptions against your design.  I spent hours and 
hours optimizing a design that was never constructed, 
simply because I was told to assume that the down 
force bonus would be experienced.  I never bothered to 
verify this myself, and this disconnection had dire 
consequences.”
