What Is Design Optimization?

Selecting the “best” design within the available means

1. What is our criterion for “best” design?

Objective function

2. What are the available means?

Constraints
(design requirements)

3. How do we describe different designs?

Objective function and constraints must be expressed 
as a function of design variables (or design vector X)
