1.  Component Description 

 
a  one  paragraph  overview  description  of  what 
contain 
should 
section 
(This 
component/subsystem  needs  to  be  designed, what  functions  this  components/should  fulfill,  how 
it will fit into the parent system, and why it is important) 
 
 

2.  Functional Requirements 
 
(This  section  should  contain  a  numbered  list  of  functional  requirements,  and  describe  what  the 
to-be-designed  component/subsystem  should  achieve,  not  how  it  is  to  be  achieved.  The 
requirements  are  specifications  of  function,  not  form.  It  is  important  that  as many  requirements 
as possible contain a qualifier  (equal  to,  smaller  than, greater  than) as well as quantitative value, 
e.g. 40 N of force.) 
 
 
3.  Constraints 

 
(Constraints  represent  operating  conditions  or  parameters  are  given  and  that  cannot  be  violated 
and that are outside the control of the design team.)

4.  Interface Definition 
 
(This  section  lists  all  the  mechanical,  electrical,  and  software  interfaces  that  the  to-be-designed 
component/subsystem must adhere to. It might be helpful to add a figure here.) 
 
 
5.  Verification 

 
(This section should explain how specifically, once the component/subsystem has been designed, 
it  will  be  verified  whether  or  not  the  functional  requirements,  constraints  and  interfaces  are 
satisfied.)
