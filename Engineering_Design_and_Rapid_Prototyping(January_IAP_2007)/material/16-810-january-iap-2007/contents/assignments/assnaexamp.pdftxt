1.  Component Description 

z

 
 
A new  rear wing design  is needed  for  the 2005/2006 model year MIT Formula SAE  race 
car.  The  rear-mounted  wing  (Fig.1)  is  intended  to  maximize  downward  force  (negative  lift), 
while at  the same  time minimizing  incremental drag and weight added  to  the vehicle. The wings 
have to conform to regulations (constraints) and be designed and manufactured in an economical 
fashion.  
 
 
Aerodynamic  efficiency  is  one  of  the 
most 
important  elements 
in  developing  a 
competitive  race  car.  Aerodynamic  design  is 
concerned  with  two  primary  elements:  reducing 
drag  (D)  and  increasing  downforce  (negative 
lift,  L).  Downforce  is  necessary  in  maintaining 
high  speeds  through  the  corners  and  forces  the 
car  to  the  track.  In  actual  race  car  design  there 
are 
complex 
interactions 
between 
the 
aerodynamics  of  the  front  wing,  rear  wing  and 
the  chassis  as  all  three  main  components  (in 
addition  to  the  tires)  contribute  to  both  drag  and 
downforce.

2.  Functional Requirements 
 
2.1  The  rear  wing  shall  produce  a  downforce  of  at  least  250  N  (Newtons  of  force)  at  the 
steady state operating condition in the –z direction.

2.2  The rear wing shall not produce more than 75 N (Newtons of force) of drag at the steady 
state operating condition in the x direction. 

 
2.3  The mass of the rear wing shall not exceed 2.5 kg. 

2.4  The  structural  integrity  of  the  rear  wing  shall  be  maintained  over  the  entire  operating 
regime of the vehicle, including all speeds and cornering conditions below 100 miles per 
hour (mph). A safety factor of 2 shall be used for all structural load cases. 

2.5  The wing shall not deflect by more than 10 mm at any point below 100 mph. 
 
3.  Constraints 

3.1  The  steady  state  operating  condition  is  defined  as  a  straight  line  un-accelerated  drive  at 
60 miles per hour (60 mph) over flat terrain 

 
3.2  The  rear  wing  may  only  be  manufactured  from  6061  aluminum,  blue  construction 
insulation  foam  (R-8  insulation  value),  fiberglass  and  epoxy  adhesive.  Manufacturing 
shall occur on an OMAX waterjet machine, assuming a rate of $75/hour. 

3.3  The  wing  shall  be  created  as  an  extrusion  of  a  2D  wing  section,  thus  limiting  the 
aerodynamic analysis to 2D section airfoils.  There will be no taper or dihedral allowed. 

3.4  No external energy source is allowed as part of the device. 

4.  Interface Definition 
 
4.1  The maximum design envelope  for  the wing and  its support structure  is 20” x 20” x 40” 
(width, height, span).   

 
4.2  The  support  structure  must  match  the  dimensions  and  the  hole  pattern  shown  in  Fig.  2. 
There are two support brackets located 39.75 (+/-0.5) inches apart, from inside surface to 
inside surface.  The two bolts holes (5/16th inch O.D.) on each side the supporting fixture 
are 16.0 inches apart, and 1.0 inch above the lower plane of the envelope.

5.  Verification 

 

5.1  The  rear  wing  will  be  mounted  on  the  attachment  structure  (Fig.2)  and  a  set  of 
measurements will be taken in the MIT Wright Brothers wind tunnel with a six axis load 
cell.  From  these  measurements  the  lift,  drag  and  side  force  will  be  extracted  and 
compared with requirements (2.1, 2.2 and 2.3), respectively. 

 
5.2  The wind tunnel will be run between 10 to 100 mph in 20 mph increments. The safety of 
the  wing  will  be  verified  throughout  the  operation  by  monitoring  the  test  with  video 
cameras from the control room (2.4) 

5.3  A  static  load  test  will  be  performed.  The  maximum  deflection  limit  (2.5),  and  safety 
factor  for  stress will be verified with  laser distance measurement  equipment  and bonded 
strain gauges.
