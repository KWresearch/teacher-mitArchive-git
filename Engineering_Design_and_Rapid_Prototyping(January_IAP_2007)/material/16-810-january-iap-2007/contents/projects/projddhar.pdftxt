1.  Microwave Circuitry 

 
Nearly  all  components  of  the  waveguide  circuitry  will  be  purchased,  so  that manufacturing  and 
assembly  is  rather  limited.  Waveguide  components  come  equipped  with  6  holes  for  2.4mm 
diameter  screws.  Screws  of  4cm  length  are  long  enough  to  protrude  on  both  sides  of  the  thick 
brass  plate  around  the  waveguide  protrusions.  All  that  is  needed  is  to  assemble  the  12 
Magnetrons  2-by-2  to  beam  combiners,  combining  four  of  these  6  pairings  into  two  more 
pairings, and combining these new parings with another pair, so that the magnetrons are grouped 
in  two  groups  of  6.  Combining  these  two  groups  with  the  quadrature  coupler  yields  a  single 
beam source of appropriately polarized light. 
This  source  should now be  connected  to  the 41cm waveguide,  then  attached  to  the  first H-bend, 
second  waveguide  (61cm)  and  second  H-bend  (the  radiation  exiting  from  the  second  H-bend 
should be parallel to that of the first, directed in the opposite sense). 
 
The  next  item  to  be  manufactured  is  the  horn.  A  design  template  was  generated  from  Paul 
Wade’s  hdl_3b4  program,  which  can  be  copied  onto  the  copper  sheet  with  any  punch.  Cutting 
the  copper  sheet  can  be  simply  done  by  saw,  followed  by  punching  12  holes  in  the  indicated 
areas,  finally  folding  along  the  necessary  lines,  and  bolting  the  horn  in  its  final  shape. 
Connecting  this  horn  to  the  third  (14cm)  waveguide  occurs  in  the  same manner  as  the  previous 
two  cases.  This  final microwave  circuitry  section  should  only  be  connected  to  the  rest  once  the 
circuit is supported by the horn support.

2.  Dish Support 

 
The process is again quite simple, detailed here: 
 

2 

•  Cut steel tubing to desired length and angle with chop saw 
•  Cut steel plates with band saw 
•  Drill ½” holes in the plates 
•  Weld plates to single end of tubing 
•  Drill hole into frame of dish 
•  Bolt legs onto the dish through these holes 

 
 

3.  Horn and Waveguide Support 

 
It will not be much challenging to craft the horn support. 
•  Cut 4 40.3” and 63” tubing and angle with chop saw. 
•  Bolt the main join together holding the longer side perpendicular to the 40.3” part. 
•  Take  the  wigi-wigi  tube  and  as  designed  attach  them  with  the  structure,  so  as  to 
increase stability. 
•  Put  the  waveguides  through  the  tube  cavity,  and  bolt  the  horn  with  the  extended 
plate of the longer hand. 
•  Bolt the leg with a 10” X 10” metal/polycarbonate base.
