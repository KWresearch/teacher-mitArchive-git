Method of Fabrication 

 

 

The PCB will be manufactured using a standard practice known as etching. A 
substrate is coated with copper, and then a trace, or temporary mask is printed onto the 
board. The most accessible method for printing the trace is by using silk screen printing, 
which prints etch-resistant ink onto the board. This coats parts of the copper, so that when 
the entire board is dipped into chemical solvents, the copper not covered by the mask 
disintegrates. After this, holes are drilled for through-hole components (although in this 
case all the components are surface mount, and t
his is not necessary).   

 

The two mounting plates (the structural plate and the shielding plate) will be 
ted using the waterjet. Using the Omax layout file, the water/abrasive mixture 
fabrica
will 
dispense at high pressure along the cut line. These two plates will be attached together 
using bolts, and the climber legs will attach to the holes laid out near the center. The PC
B 
panels will be mounted to the shielding layer using thermal double-sided foam adhesive. 
The power outputs on these boards will be connected in a combination of series/parallel 
configurations dependant on voltage-output from the test results. 

 

 

Material Choice 
There are three different materials need for design.  These are the PCB board, a 
shielding material and a structural material. 
The structural material needs to be lightweight and capable of taking a large 
amount of tension.  As a result carbon fiber was chosen as the material 
The shielding material needs to be capable of absorbing 5.8 GHz radiation.  This 
means that it has to both be conductive and be a certain thickness (dependent on the 
material chosen)  Fortunately the wavelength is so large that the minimal thickness of the 
shielding for most materials is so small that it is unlikely to be reached without precision 
machining.  The deciding factor among the different metals was the strength of the 
material.  The more support the material can offer the less support the support structure 
has to provide.  Thus a steel sheet with .1 inch thickness was chosen.   
t 
For the PCB the largest concern was that it didn’t react to the microwave and hea
uggested in lecture that does not heat up in 
up excessively.  Fortunately a material was s
reaction
ing 
s to the frequency we are using, that being Arlon FoamClad.   Thus we are us
that material as the third layer which holds the rectenna.
