Motivation

MITSET Power Beaming Competition
• Primary focus of competition is power beaming
• Microwave energy chosen for efficiency and scalability
• Needs to supply an adequate power supply to rectennas
• Needed a system that could easily be 
assembled/disassembled
• High efficiency and cost effectiveness are the primary 
targets of project

Systems Overview

Design divided into three subsystems
Dish
•
– Utilizes a pre-made satellite dish for simplicity and 
cost effectiveness
– Needed to collimate the microwave energy
– Needs to be fast and easy to assemble around the 
ribbon
– Needs to be stable as well as level
• Microwave horn support
– Designed to hold the microwave horn over the 
center of the dish
– Has an adjustable height to allow for an adjustable 
focus
– Has to be rigid enough to support magnetron and 
horn and precisely place them over the dish

Systems Overview

• Microwave Circuit
– Provides microwave energy for climber
– Circularly polarizes the microwave energy
– Transfers to Climber
– Needs to be as efficient as possible
– Uses a magnetron mated with a polarizer, and 
a horn to project energy

Circuitry Support

Wigi-wigi technology…
Proves to be pretty stable.

16.810 IAP 2007

M1: Microwave Beam Source

Positive sides:
1) Very light 
weight.
2) Greater stability
3) Can be put 
together pretty 
fast.
4) Minimal air 
resistance.
5) Easy to make, 
and cheap.

Negative sides.
1) Still have to figure out a way to make the y-axis variable, as 
desired.
2) Unstable weight distribution (40” X 63”)

Polarization (Rectenna Related)
Beam blockage losses
Software use
Beam source and signal type
Beam directionality losses
Beam Collimation: variable 
reflector height
Play with the “wigi-wigi”, to figure 
out the optimum binding for 
perfect stability.
Unstable weight distribution 
(40.3” X 63”)
Improve stability, by proper load 
distribution (depends on new 
configuration)

Recommendations to MITSET
• Redesign incorporating Mr. Willwerth’s rather 
nice ideas
• Perform Thermal Analysis
• Comsol would be nice…
• Review design by fresh person before testing
• Test in sections before all up:
– Magnetron alone
– Waveguides + optimize
– Waveguides + emitter
– Reflector
– Waveguides + reflector + optimize
– Waveguides + receptor antennae
– Reflector + receptor antennae

What We’ve Learned

• Trust measurements over specs
• Don’t trust specialists
• Trust specialists
• Simplest design works best
• There’s plenty to know about microwaves. What actually matters for 
implementation is tiny, but it’s hard to find out what it is.
It’s possible to do crazy things in one month. It’s hard to do them 
right.
