The motor is an axial-gap brushless DC motor with two stators and one rotor disc.  This 
 
description might not line up with the illustrations in the CDR presentation due to the rapid 
development of the system; calculations and discussions have led to further improved designs that 
couldn't be CADed in time.   
 
The motor consists of the rotor disc attached to the axle by two steel cylinders which are welded 
in place.  This axle sits on two conical automobile bearings which hold it in place between the two 
halves of the polycarbonate safety shell.  The safety shell has holes for ventilation, and it doubles as the 
mount for the stator coils, which are embedded within it.  It is held in place around the rotor disc by six 
steel arms, which in turn are retained by retaining rings and small bolts.  The power cables are fed 
through the polycarbonate shell, and the Hall sensor feeds are run along the outside through a small 
hole at the very edge.   
 
Sections to be manufactured include 
 
1. The Rotor Disc 
 
The steel plate should be the appropriate size as ordered.  A 1-1/4” hole is milled through the center.  
Six evenly-spaced 1/4” holes are milled in the plate 1-5/8” from the center.  The plate is coated with a 
thin layer of epoxy.  Then the magnets are arranged radially with alternating polarity against the epoxy 
layer, with another thin layer of epoxy on every surface between magnets.  Once the epoxy has cured, 
the process of adding magnets is repeated on the opposite side of the steel disc, with flux carried 
through the disc (i.e. no magnetic poles oppose through the disc).   
 
2. The Driveshaft 
 
The steel rod is cut to 7” in length.  Six evenly-spaced 1/4” holes are milled through each of the steel 
cylinders.  The first steel cylinder (3/8” thickness) is placed 2/3” from the end of  the rod and welded in 
place.  The rotor disc is then fitted onto the steel rod against the steel cylinder, and the six 1/4” bolts are 
placed through the holes in the cylinder and the disc.  The second steel cylinder is then fitted onto the 
steel rod (axle), meshed with the bolts and pressed flush with the rotor disc.  This second cylinder is 

then welded into place.  The retaining nuts are fixed to the ends of the bolts with lock-tite and 
tightened.  The tapered bearings are then attached to the axle on either side of the cylinders, facing 
outwards.   
 
3. The Coils 
 
The stranded wire is laminated.  It is then wound to shape on the winding machine.  (18 coils are 
needed.)  The recessions in the polycarbonate frame are half-filled with epoxy and the coils fitted 
solidly into place so that they protrude two millimeters above the surface of the polycarbonate.   
 
4. The Shell 
 
 The steel frame is waterjetted from stock in six arms.  The ends of each arm are rounded along the 
shortest axis so that their end surfaces fit radially with one another; a notch is cut into either side of the 
arms at both ends and a 3/16” hole milled and tapped between the notches.  Two steel rings, one of 
outer diameter 4” and inner diameter 3-3/8” and one of outer diameter 2” and inner diameter 1-1/4” are 
waterjetted from stock.  Six evenly spaced radial notches for the arms are cut into each ring.  A hole 
3/16” diameter is milled and tapped in each notch.  The remaining five-inch piece of steel rod is keyed 
to fit into the AHPV suspension arm.  The two halves of the polycarbonate shell with coil and frame 
grooves are milled out from stock.  Four ridges are welded to the outside of each of the bearing rings, 
and the rings are embedded within the shell halves.   
 
5. Electronics 
 
The Hall Effect sensors are placed on the shell at a radius of five inches in between the radial segments 
of two coils and are placed every other coil thereafter around the frame.  They are secured in place by 
epoxy, and their signal wires run to the outside of the motor.  The power cables run through the shell 
through the cable hole and run in a circle at a radius of two inches to provide power to the coils.  The 
cables also run along a groove to one side of the shell to provide power to the far stator.   
 
To assemble the subsystems:  
 
The axle with bearings is placed into the suspension-arm half of the motor so that the rotor surface and 

stator coils are separated by a millimeter of air.  Next the second half of the shell is placed on top so 
that the axle protrudes through the hole in the middle.  The rotor bearings should be snugly seated.  The 
polycarbonate shell halves should be aligned and fitted together.  The steel arms are placed radially 
around the two halves, and the two retaining rings are fitted into place to hold the arms.  All twelve 
bolts are inserted and the suspension-arm bar is inserted and bolted into place.   
 
 
Assembly is paid at $40/hr; Engineering is paid at $75/hr; Machining is paid at $50/hr.
