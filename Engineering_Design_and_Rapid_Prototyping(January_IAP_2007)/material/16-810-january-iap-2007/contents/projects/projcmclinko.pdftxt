We were initially given the roller assembly, which has not been weight optimized 
with the exception of the gears, which were optimized much earlier due to the density of 
steel.  We therefore decided to optimize the side bars, side plates, and rollers for weight 
while maintaining a minimum factor of safety of 2.  The rest of this document will be 
broken down based on component: 
 
Belay Side Bar
The belay side bar was restrained at the bolt holes connecting it to the rest of the climber.  
The holes connecting to the U-bolts of the belay system were applied with 123N of force, 
as the climber would be subjected to by a climber of weight 25kg. 

Figure 1: Belay Side Bar Forces 
The resulting factor of safety distribution has a minimum factor of safety of 2.3 and the 
stress is fairly evenly spaced along the ribs of the bar. 

 

Figure 2: Belay Side Bar FOS 

 

The resulting displacement distribution is as follows, with maximum displacement of 
1.5e-3m. 

 

Figure 3: Belay Side Bar Displacement 
The resulting factor of safety and displacement distributions fit the functional 
requirements and the even displacement of force ensures weight minimization. 
 
Cross Side Bar
The cross side bar was restrained at the bolt holes connecting it to the rest of the climber.  
The hole connecting the cross bar to the motor holder is subjected to a 29pound outward 
force and a 10pound side force. 

Figure 4: Cross Side Bar Forces 
The resulting factor of safety distribution has a minimum factor of safety of 2.2 and the 
stress is fairly evenly spaced along the ribs of the bar.  Although the middles of the ribs 
take less force, making them thinner would prove too risky. 

 

Figure 5: Cross Side Bar FOS 
The resulting displacement distribution is as follows, with maximum displacement of 
9.8e-4m. 

 

 

Figure 6: Cross Side Bar Displacement 
The resulting factor of safety and displacement distributions fit the functional 
requirements and the even displacement of force ensures weight minimization. 
 
Drive Rollers
The drive roller was restrained at the keyways connecting it to the drive axles.  The 
surface of the roller is subjected to a 7N-m torque, which is equivalent to half the weight 
of the climber, which is the force to which the rollers are subjected. 

Figure 7: Drive Roller Forces 
The resulting factor of safety distribution has a minimum factor of safety of 2.1 and the 
stress is as evenly spaced along the roller as is possible to ensure that mounting hardware 
can still be used to connect the roller caps to the roller body. 

 

Figure 8: Drive Roller FOS 
The resulting displacement distribution is as follows, with maximum displacement of 
4.9e-4m. 

 

 

Figure 9: Drive Roller Displacement 
The resulting factor of safety and displacement distributions fit the functional 
requirements and the relatively even displacement of force ensures weight minimization. 
 
Guide Rollers
The drive roller was restrained at the keyways connecting it to the drive axles.  The 
surface of the roller is subjected to a 7N-m torque, which is equivalent to half the weight 
of the climber, which is the force to which these rollers may be subjected. 

Figure 10: Guide Roller Forces 
The resulting factor of safety distribution has a minimum factor of safety of 2.1 and the 
stress is as evenly spaced along the roller as is possible to ensure that mounting hardware 
can still be used to connect the roller caps to the roller body. 

 

Figure 11: Guide Roller FOS 
The resulting displacement distribution is as follows, with maximum displacement of 
5.7e-4m. 

 

 

Figure 12: Drive Roller Displacement 
The resulting factor of safety and displacement distributions fit the functional 
requirements and the relatively even displacement of force ensures weight minimization. 
 
Side Plates
The side plates are restrained at all locations where the sidebars meet the plates.  All of 
the axle holes are subjected to 7N-m of torque.  This torque comes from the rollers 
pressing against the ribbon and is transferred to the side plates.  The forces in the motor 
axle hole on the right plate or the slot on the left plate have a torque of 12 in-lb.   All the 
axle holes have a downward force of 5 lb.  The bottom of the plate experiences a 
downward force of 123 N (or 15 kg).

Figure 14: Side Plate Forces (Right) 
 
The left plate has a minimum factor of safety of 20.  This is a high factor of safety, much 
higher than the minimum required; however, the stresses are evenly spread out, with the 
lowest fos at of the corner of the bottom triangles. 
 
The right plate has a minimum factor of safety of 17.  The lowest fos is in the same 
position as with the left plate.  Additional stress had to be spread from the motor axle in 
the center of the plate, which does not exist on the left plate. 
 

Figure 15: FOS (Left) 

 

Figure 16: FOS (Right) 
 
The largest amount of displacement occurs in the bottom corners, with a maximum 
displacement of 5.787e-5 m and 6.078e-5 m for the left and right plates respectively.   

 

Figure 17: Displacement (Left) 

 

Figure 18: Displacement (Right) 
 
With the high fos for both plates, the displacements and forces are kept to a minimum.  
This keeps the plates in the acceptable limits of the project.
