Canopy 
 
After initial experiments to try and heat form 
plastic with heat guns, using the same mould 
used to create the shell, we decided that it 
would be impossible to make the transparent 
canopy ourselves.  
 
Instead, the canopy fabrication was 
outsourced to a manufacturer in Florida, who 
normally made aircraft canopies and had 
created a canopy for Pulse, another VDS 
vehicle. Based on a three-view drawing we 
provided to him, he was able to send us a 
canopy on a turnaround of only 5 days, which 
was necessary to meet our tight deadline. 
 
 
 
Rails 

16.810 Manufacturing Report 
Team V1 

 
 
The following parts are required for the ingress/egress system: 
 

 
The rails were designed to be cut on a 
waterjet, as the complicated curving 
shape was too difficult to cut by hand 
and too large for the mill. 
 
In order to maximize stiffness against 
side loading, we originally chose to 
make the rails out of an aluminium-
plywood ‘sandwich’ material. 
However, delamination occurred when 
cutting on the waterjet, and when we 

tried to stick the layers back together, we found that stiffness was poor. 
 
Instead, we chose to use ¼” aluminium (sticking with aluminium to save weight), and 
found this to be adequate for stiffness and strength. The internal faces of the rail were 
sanded to give a smooth opening motion. 
 
 
 
Handles 
 
The ‘ribs’ were made out of 1/16” aluminium, and 
waterjetted as this was the fastest method of manufacture. 
The connecting aluminium tube was cut to length by hand, 
and the pieces were welded together by the MIT Central 
Machine Shop.  
 
 
 
Existing Shell 
 

Marking an accurate curve on the 
existing shell was the hardest part of 
the manufacturing process; we 
carefully aligned the rails and used 
them to draw a curve on one side, 
extending it by eye to the nose of the 
vehicle. A grid was then created on 
the shell using masking tape and 
string to accurately reproduce this 
curve on the opposite side.  
 
The shell was cut using a diamond 
cutting disk and a Dremel tool – this 
gave a reasonable finish, requiring a 
little sanding to give a smooth edge. 

 
 
Locking Mechanism 
 
Although not implemented, we intended to use magnetic strips to hold the canopy in 
place while driving – we also intended to use foam or rubber tubing to ensure the canopy 
sat smoothly on the shell.

Integration and Assembly 
 
A major problem we encountered while trying to mount the canopy to the shell was that 
the canopy was made slightly too large in places, tending to bubble out where the shell 
was flatter. This made it very difficult to attach the two, as too much stress would cause 
the fragile canopy to break. After much deliberation, we cut the canopy to a smaller size, 
making it more flexible, and mounted it to the shell using Velcro, which proved to be an 
excellent choice due its strength in shear. (Some of the cut-out portion of the shell was 
used to reinforce the Plexiglas canopy.) 
 
We also chose to use Velcro to attach the handles to the canopy, and U-Clamps were 
used to attach the rail system to the existing chassis. These allowed for easy removal of 
the ingress/egress system if required. 
 
Unfortunately, due to the tight deadline, the system had not been fully finished and tested 
before having to leave for SolidWorks World, but it is anticipated the small amount of 
work still needed will be completed en route.
