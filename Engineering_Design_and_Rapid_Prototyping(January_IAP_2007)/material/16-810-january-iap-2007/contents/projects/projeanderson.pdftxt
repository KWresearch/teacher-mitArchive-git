Motivation

Why Microwave?

• Efficient method of 
transmitting large 
amounts of energy
• Small wavelength = 
higher energy
• Passes easily through 
the atmosphere

Uses

• Orbiting solar “power plant” satellites
• Aircrafts
• Transportation (“Space Elevator”)
• Basically anywhere large power sources 
are not feasible to store, a tether is near 
impossible, and a high energy demand 
exists

Requirements

• Provide enough power to the climber over 
50 seconds to meet the following 
requirements from it’s capacitor array
– 24 V
– 400 W
– 16.7 amps
• Properly shield the rest of the climber from 
the microwave source

Parameters

• Must optimize for efficiency

Arriving At An Answer

“Rectapenna”

MILAX (Canada)

Texas A&M University 
Rectenna
• Research into microwave power 
transmission started after WWII
• NASA got involved in the 70s and 80s
• Currently mostly space-based applications 
are being explored

This leaves only two variables, efficiency of climber and efficiency of rectenna

• Possible to now generate a bounding 
constraint on the efficiencies

upper

lower

Analysis

• Beam density estimation is both low and 
idealized
• Ratio is extremely low

Future Work to be done

– Create a simulation of the equations 
mentioned above so as to accurately reflect 
the efficiencies envelope with various 
changes
– Change the rectenna design so it captures 
more area of the beam per square foot of the 
rectenna panel
– Do an actual build and test of the equipment, 
then tweak the tradeoff between efficiency 
and area of antenna till it’s optimal

Lessons Learned

• Variable optimization can be subtle
• Sometimes the fine tuned answer is not 
necessarily the best answer
• The best way to get results, is to perform 
tests
• Have very well defined goals that serve 
the long term
