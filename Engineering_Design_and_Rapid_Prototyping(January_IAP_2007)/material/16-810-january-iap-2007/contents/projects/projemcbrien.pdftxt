Analysis and Optimization

Test 1 – ‘Hard Opening’
• Highest dynamic load when someone opens canopy and pins hit end of rails
• Force of 2g * mass of canopy ~ 11 pounds
• Restraints of fixed edges roughly equivalent to final design
• Stress concentrated around joint
• Displacements acceptable

Test 2 – ‘Driving Pressure Force’
• Pressure on canopy while driving 60mph ~550N/m2
• Restraints of fixed edges based on magnetic strips
• Natural modes at low freq – first mode at 0.5Hz 
• Canopy displacement ~3mm max at 60mph

Test 3 – ‘Rail Optimization’
• Varied thickness of rail to find optimum size to avoid yield at min mass
• Force of 40N side load – someone leaning on canopy

• We tried to use a thicker sandwich material – delaminated
• Now using 0.25 inch aluminium, slightly different rail design

What’s Next…?
• Handles welded to rails
• Attach rail to chassis
• Sand shell and canopy
• Reinforcing canopy
• Attaching canopy to reinforcement
• Attaching reinforced canopy to handles
• Test mechanism, fix problems!
• Stick on magnetic strips so canopy stays shut
• Drive AHPV to Solidworks World
• Sleep…

Lessons Learned

• Set realistic goals
• Better use of FEA for optimization – our rail could have been designed 
to be lighter
• Start manufacturing early, maybe finish on time
• Have the right tools
• Make the right decisions at the right time
