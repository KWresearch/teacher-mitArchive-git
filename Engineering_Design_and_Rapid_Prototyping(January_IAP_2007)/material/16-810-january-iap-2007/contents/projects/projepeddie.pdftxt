Motivation

• The AHPV from VDS 1.0 
used an expensive, NGM 
electric hub motor, 
costing roughly $8000. 
(picture on right)

• VDS 1.0 required a new 
electric hub motor to 
serve as both a 
replacement for the NGM 
motor, and as a stepping 
stone design for VDS 2.0.

Requirements (Preliminary)

• 10 kW continuous Power
• 90%+ efficiency optimized for 45 miles an hour.
• Motor weight less than 30 kg
• Must interface with EV-C200 controller
• Acceleration from 0-60 mph in less than 15 s.
• Solar/Battery power must be used
• Constant Torque with speed variation

Constraints
• Motor must fit between wheel 
and suspension arm, not 
interfere with other 
components
• Motor cannot draw more 
power then controller can 
supply

• Torque must not     
surpass limit of  
suspension arm bolt  
hole

Preliminary Design Choices 
Design Choices (cid:198) Why did we decide to design a 3-phase, axial 
gap, double sided, slotted, surface mounted brushless DC motor? 
Note, these design choices were made based on research, not 
simulated optimization.
Brushless Hub Motor (cid:198) Comparison to Brush Hub Motor
higher efficiency and reliability (reduction  of electromagnetic
interference)
reduced noise 
longer lifetime (no brush erosion)
However, more difficult to control (resolved by digital control)
Why 3-phase?
Excellent starting conditions with smooth rotation and low 
torque ripple (cid:198) No structural resonance and induced 
mechanical stress
Flexible (cid:198) Work with large variety of magnet configurations, 
winding configurations, and coil winding
– Good  conductor utilization  (cid:198) Higher phases give better 
utilization but are offset by increased numbers of leads and 
transistors

Preliminary Design Choices (Continued)

• Why axial gap?
– Spatial limitations (cid:198) Motor must interface with suspension arm; 
fixed dimensions.
– Axial Gap gives compact machine  construction and short frame 
with much  shorter rotor in axial direction, and thus less  overall 
thickness
– High power density.
– High efficiency; no rotor copper losses due to     permanent-
magnet excitation.
• Why double sided air gap?
– The high attractive force between the rotor and the stator is 
counterbalanced by the use of a second stator.  
– Reduced copper and iron losses 
– Increased power density. 
– Increased cooling characteristics

Preliminary Design Choices (Continued)

• Why slotted armature?
– A motor with armature slots is more robust
– Allowance for different winding structures
– Although the slotted armature implies increased 
losses from flux ripple and tooth iron losses, the 
increased robustness is necessary to combat the 
mechanical stress.
– Slotted armatures give higher airgap flux density 
levels using fewer permanent magnets.
• Why surface mounted permanent magnets?
– Much easier construction and manufacturing 
compared to interior permanent magnets

Design Variables
• How did we optimize our motors number of poles, stator slots, 
magnet span, coil turns, magnet grade, magnet skew and air gap 
length?
• Maxwell3D was used as a means of running dynamic 
optimization (cid:198) Program errors would not allow use of Maxwell’s 
optimization toolbox (cid:198) Several configurations were analyzed 
separately so that 
various trends 
could be analyzed 
for an optimized 
engine

• On the right is the 
sketch of the engine 
prior to the 
optimization of the 
design variables

Design Variables (Continued)

our final optimized engine and

variable

Design Variables (Continued)
• Pole Number (cid:198) Smooth torque coupled with low speed generally 
implies large pole count
• 8 poles decreases thickness of rotor yoke/stator yoke, decreasing 
overall diameter.  
• 8 poles minimizes flux leakage inside rotor
• 8 poles increases the axial length of the stator and the end 
windings which reduces copper losses and increases efficiency
• Stator Slots (cid:198) Related to pole number; slot/pole number must be 
fraction to reduce cogging and skewing of poles or lamination stack. 
• 18 slots gives coil span of 2 (cid:198) easier to manufacture
• 18 slots reduces cogging torque
• 18 slots reduces the length of the end windings and consequently
the copper losses.
• Air Gap Length (cid:198) Increased length results in more overall losses 
while too small of a gap results in decreased power density

Design Variables (Continued)

• Magnet Grade (cid:198) NeFeB has a larger energy-density then other 
magnets at a reasonable cost, increasing overall power density and 
torque
• Stator offset (cid:198) 15 degree offset of stators with each other was 
arrived at; compromise between elimination of some higher order 
harmonic components (decreases overall losses) and axial 
asymmetry which can cause pulsating axial force and create losses.  
• Magnet Skew (cid:198) Skew can  eliminate cogging torque as well as 
high-frequency components related to flux losses
• Magnet Span (cid:198) Span minimizes the pulsating torque, and in turn, 
cogging torque.   
• Wire Diameter (cid:198) Optimized to turns per coil in the motor.  Larger 
diameter gives less losses, however, less turns per coil.  
• Coil Span (cid:198) Given by slot/poles, rounded down for short-pitching; 
gives an increased machine efficiency by reducing the end-turn 
lengths.

• Although inner and outer radius are good
design variables, in our case, we were 
limited by the given AHPV dimensions.  
We did, however, optimize the inner

Performance Analysis

• Maxwell3D ran simulations on various 
inputs spanning several values for 
each design variable (cid:198) Hybrid 
method of research and computer 
aided analysis was used to select 
final values.  Below are torque and 
speed graphs, and to the right is our 
model representation within Maxwell

Future Work

(cid:190)1.  Continuing Analysis Refinement
• Moving from parameters chosen originally by “rules of thumb” to CAD models 
with finer detail resolution to capture these design decisions 
• FEA simulations that span full dynamic response of the motor system including 
startup acceleration and constant speed cruising 

(cid:190)2.  Motor Controller Design and Integration
• Developing power electronics capable of supplying the minimum 10kW with 
sufficient scalability to accommodate future design demands
• Baseline software interface to ease monitoring of motor and wheel interaction 
allowing programmable performance commands (ie. Anti-lock brakes)

(cid:190)3.  Cost Reduction in Manufacturing Process
• Expand supplier base and list of coil winding companies

Lessons Learned

(cid:190) 1.  Get expert advice from the start
• Reduces confusion about basic design differences and nomenclature 
(cid:190) 2.  Get proper simulation software
• Having incompatible software made the optimization nearly possible  
(cid:190) 3.  Constraint on overall design variables
• Motor design offers more variables than can be accounted for, reduction of 
design variables preferable  
(cid:190) 4.  Further research and time required for complex new design
