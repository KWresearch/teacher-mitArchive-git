Below is an analysis of the parameter to be maximized along with the constraints on the 
system.  Based on these equations and the fixed parameters it is possible to calculate the 
range of efficiencies of the overall rectenna panel based upon the efficiency of the 
climber.  This gives the mathematical foundation to build a Matlab simulation which 
would calculate the range of efficiencies the rectenna would need to fall in based upon 
the speed of the climber, the size of the dish, the area of antennas and various other 
parameters.

The following observations can be made about Rectennas 
- Two things cause microwave signals to weaken 
o	 Spreading over a larger sphere of influence 
o  Attenuation due to the atmosphere 
- Necessary to determine how the field will change in saturation based upon height 
o	 Since beam is directional, the beam does not spread and remains constant 
(same amount of flux) 
o  Attenuation is minimal1

- Area of dish = A = pi * 1^2 = 3.14 m^2;
