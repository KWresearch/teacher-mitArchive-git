1.  Electromagnetic Wave Circuit 

 
This  section  deals  with  models  of  the  trajectory  of  the  microwaves  from  their  source  to  the 
climber.  Field  modeling  was  performed  using  Comsol  3.3  acquired  with  a  14-day  trial  student 
license graciously provided by Comsol Multiphysics. 
 
Pre-Optimization decisions: 
 
As  the  number  of  constraints  on  the  system  were  rather  limited,  the  number  of  options  for  our 
design was  large  enough  that we  couldn’t  address  all  possibilities within  the  time  available. We 
chose  for  instance  not  to  attempt  to  emit  the  electromagnetic  radiation  through  helicoidal 
antennae  simply  because  we  didn’t  have  the  necessary  knowledge  or  the  time  to  acquire  it. 
Instead our  system  relies on magnetrons  to emit electromagnetic  radiation. We also chose not  to 
transmit  the  radiation  through  coaxial  cables  as  it  would  require  two  conversions,  radiation  to 
electricity out of the magnetron, and electricity to radiation on the emitting side of the beam, and 
we don’t have the knowledge to design this in a meaningfully efficient way. 
We have omitted from the CAD model of our design both the wave combiners and the polarizing 
scheme.  This  is  mainly  due  to  our  unfamiliarity  with  Comsol  and  the  large  amount  of  work 
needed  to  add  such  intricate  items  with  numerous  boundaries.  To  achieve  sufficiently  powerful 
emitted  radiation,  12  magnetrons  would  have  to  be  assembled  with  beam  combiners  (WR-187 
TE-1 4-port directional  couplers)  in  two  sets of 6,  then  connected  to  a WR-187 TE-1  single box 
quadrature  branch  line  coupler,  combining  the  two  beams  into  one  with  a  90  degree  phase 
difference, achieving polarized light. It is this beam which we have set as boundary condition for 
our CAD model in Comsol. Other possibilities for polarization include Fresnel or Moony rhombs

and  quarter-wave  plate.  Since  quadrature  branch  line  couplers  seem  to  have  poser  losses  on  the 
order  of  4%,  we  decided  we  wouldn’t  be  able  to  achieve  such  a  value  by  designing  our  own 
optical crystal and opted for buying couplers. 
 
Optimization: 
 
As waveguides  of  a  similar price  can be obtained  for  any  frequency  and power  range,  and  since 
achieving the required output (in our CAD model) resulted in similar costs in magnetrons, we’ve 
chosen  to  keep  the  specification  of  the  one  magnetron  the  MITSET  team  already  has,  and 
propagate 5.801GHz (wavelength of 5.17 cm) microwave radiation. 
The  optimal  standard  waveguide  size  for  this  frequency  is  the  WR-187  standard  (‘G  Band’) 
which  has  dimensions  1.872’’x0.872’’  (units  always  in  inches  for  some  reason)  and  a  range  of 
3.93GHz to 5.85GHz. 
The  microwave  emitting  horn  was  designed  using  Paul  Wade’s  mysteriously  named  Hdl_3b4 
program, resulting in the following dimensions: 
-  Axial length: 64.6mm 
-  H-plane aperture: 135.9mm 
-  E-plane aperture:100.6mm 
-  Uncorrected Horn Gain: 15.8 dBi 
-  H-Plane Phase Centre: 1.41λ 
-  E-Plane Phase Centre: 1.31λ 
This horn had highest  power  flux,  considering  its  interaction with  the parabolic dish: decreasing 
the  gain will  result  in  a  less  efficient  horn,  increasing  it will  result  in  a  larger  horn  that  causes  a 
larger  amount  of  radiation  to  be  reflected  off  it  after  being  reemitted  by  the  parabolic  dish,  and 
resulting in a diminished net overall efficiency. 
Modelling  these  in Comsol, we  tweaked  the  input  power, H-bend  lengths  in  the wave  guides  to 
achieve the required power output of 127W/m2 (to power 2m-diameter rectennae). 
It  was  also  found  that  adding  a  curved  dielectric  tubing  behind  the  horn  to  guide  the  waves 
upwards  increases  the output power  in a  radius of 15 wavelengths around  the horn by 30%. The 
shape of the curve does not significantly affect this value, so long as it is convex. 
The  final  output  efficiency  is  8%  according  to  Comsol.  This  means  that  our  system  emits  a 
power  flux of 130W/m2 outside  the parabolic dish. This value estimate  is certainly not  final  (see 
section 3). Our initial back of the envelope calculation based on the link equation: 
 

 
With  C/P  the  Received  to  Emitted  Power  flux  ratio,  Ll  the  line  loss,  La  the  transmission  power 
loss,  Gp  the  parabolic  antenna  gain,  Gh  the  horn  antenna  gain,  ηp  and  ηh  their  respective 
efficiency,  D  the  rectenna  diameter  and  H  the  horn  antenna  footprint  on  the  parabolic  antenna; 
yields an efficiency of 14%.

At first we decided to have a variable height adjustable horn holding stand, so that if required we 
can  adjust  the  height  of  the  horn  to  achieve  better microwave  collimation  at  the  rectenna  plates 
on the climber. But then analyzing the situation, we came to the conclusion, that such a feature is 
not that important as we can achieve the best result only when the horn is hold at the focal point. 
The  focal  point  of  the  parabolic  dish was  found  to  be  around  40in  above  and  60in  from  the  end 
of  the  antenna.  It was  challenging  to make  the  stand  stable,  because whatever  structure we  use, 
one end always bent forward because of the unstable weight distribution. (Ref: CAD modeling of 
the stand)  
 
Our remedy this problem was that to increase the height of the stand, so that even after it getting 
bent  the  horn  will  be  hold  at  the  focal  point.  Finally  the  dimensions  that  we  got  were  Height 
(45in)  and  Length  (63in).  It  proves  to  be  pretty  stable.  More  work  can  be  done  to  improve  the 
structural strength so that it can withstand wind produced vibrations etc.  
 
 

3.  Design notes 

 
As the system is quite complex, we would like to add a few notes concerning further modeling of 
the system and testing, for the benefit of the MITSET team. Time constraints prevented the team 
from  completing  the  following  4  steps we  feel  are  absolutely  necessary  prior  to  purchasing  any 
parts and testing: 
 

•  Thermal modeling and heat dissipation analysis.  
The  software  Comsol  seems  to  provide  appropriate  tools  for  such  an  analysis,  but  a  3D 
model  of  the  electromagnetic  radiation  path  is  necessary  for  accurate  modeling  to  be 
performed.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  nature  of  the  waveguides  and  horn  which  lack 
symmetry in the z-direction: the horn is “thicker than wide” in the z direction whereas the 
waveguides are “thinner than wide”. 
•  The  circularly  polarizing  section  of  the waveguide  circuit  should  be  added  to  the model, 
so that exact impedance matching can be achieved. This is crucial for the beaming system 
to be efficient 
•  The  option  of  using  helicoidal  antennae  should  be  analyzed  sufficiently  to  determine 
whether or not their application could be more efficient 
•  Once  these  steps  are  taken,  a  specialist  (Prof.  Woskov?  Mr.  Willwerth?)  should  review 
the whole design to determine whether something obvious was overlooked. 

 
In  addition,  since  all  references  we  have  found  agree  that  microwave  circuits  never  perform 
according  to  design,  we  strongly  recommend  that  testing  be  gradual  rather  than  all-up.  We 
propose to follow at least the following steps to validate the design: 
 

1.  Switch the magnetron(s) on (probably the hardest task listed here). 
2.  Assemble  waveguide  system  up  to  horn  (without  horn,  ie  just  the  two  H-bends).  Roll  a 
steel  ball  (with  the  aid  of  a  permanent  magnet)  inside  the  waveguides  and  see  how  this 
affects performance. Insert screws where performance is enhanced by the presence of the 
ball.

3.  Add  Horn  to  the  assembled  circuit,  and  test  performance.  If  the  actual  performance  is 
excessively  different  from  the  predicted  one,  redesigning  and  building  the  horn  with  a 
greater  gain  is  not  particularly  difficult,  but  will  prevent  a  larger  area  of  the  radiation 
reflected by the dish from attaining the rectennas. 
4.  Use  the  magnetron’s  waveguide  to  directly  project  onto  the  parabolic  dish  and  test  for 
efficiency, reshaping the mesh in necessary areas. 
5.  Add the dish to the assembled circuit, and adjust the position of the horn until the focus is 
at  the  H-plane  and  E-plane  phase  centres  are  at  the  dish’s  focus  (an  offset  of  one 
centimeter can cause a 3dB loss).
