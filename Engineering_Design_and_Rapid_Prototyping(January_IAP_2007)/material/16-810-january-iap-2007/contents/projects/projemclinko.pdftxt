Motivation
Motivation
• Roller assembly moves 
climber up ribbon
• Rollers, plates, and sidebars 
all have extra mass
• Purpose
– Less power needed to climb
– Increased score

Requirements
Requirements

• Minimize climber weight
• Minimize climber cost
• Minimize time to attach climber to ribbon

Constraints
Constraints

• Climber must survive a 2 m drop test
• Climber must lift own weight
• Average speed > 2 m/s
• Material unaffected by 5.8 GHz microwaves
• Climber unaffected by water

Design Rationale
Design Rationale

Focus
Minimize weight in order to aid in speeding 
up the climber

Cost was less important, but didn’t use 
strange materials

Wanted something simple and effective

Manufacturing
Manufacturing
• Side Bars and Belay Side Bars
– Water jetted out of ½’’ polycarb
– Milled holes for screws
• Side plates
– Water jetted
– Milled holes for axles and screws
• Rollers
– Cut on bandsaw
– Lathed
– Drill pressed holes for screws

Assembly
Assembly
• Side Bars and Belay Side Bars
– Screwed into the slots on the side plates
– Belay hook will be added to the central two 
holes
– Side bars will be mounted to the motor
• Side plates
– Attached to the motor, side bars, rollers, and 
clamps by screws or simply pressed together
• Roller
– Attached by screws and an axle to the side 
plates

Future Work
Future Work
• Not everything could be completed during 
IAP
– Work will continue after the class ends
• The side plates will be finished
• Rollers will be hollowed out
• Side bars will be created
• After all this occurs, the new pieces will be 
put together and tested as a new recursion 
of the climber

Final Conclusions
Final Conclusions
• The weight drop is significant
• Will alter the performance of the climber for 
the better
• Cut large pieces out of the materials while 
maintaining a good FOS
• Further iterations of this process will be 
necessary to achieve the ideal parts
– Continued shaving off of material may occur
– Many of the pieces achieved a radical new 
design
• Sign of the evolution of a project

Lessons Learned
Lessons Learned
• Do not trust random other students 
regarding the operation of machinery
• If it can go wrong, it will—over and over 
again.
• The iterative process is effective and can be 
repeated infinitely
– There’s always something better out there
• -Double checking position of hole before 
optimizing

Lessons Learned
Lessons Learned
• Peel the plastic off before water jetting
• When doing large water jet parts, pause 
water jet periodically to make sure the piece 
hasn't shifted
• Standard truss ribs are very inefficient for 
side bars, ribs connecting forces make much 
more sense
