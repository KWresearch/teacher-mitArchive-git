1.  Component Description 

Designed  and  constructed  during  six  weeks  of  the  VDS  summit  in  Summer  2006,  the  Assisted 
Human Powered Vehicle (AHPV)  is a  concept of  a human-solar car hybrid. Due to  the tight and 
rigid  deadlines  involved,  the  AHPV  was  left  unfinished,  with  no  means  of  egress/ingress,  and 
problems with visibility due to the lack of a proper windshield. 

Our  task  is  to design  and  implement  a method for the driver  to  enter  and exit  the vehicle,  and  to 
create a windshield  that affords the driver more visibility. These systems can be  treated either as 
two  separate  systems or  one  integrated  system. As well  as  the  important  practical  aspects of  the 
design,  we must  also  pay  special  attention  to  the  aesthetics  of  the  vehicle;  in  four  weeks,  it will 
be presented  by  the CEO of  Solidworks  at  a major  conference.  Further  in  the  future,  the AHPV 
will compete in the Shell Eco Marathon in California. 

2.  Functional Requirements 

2.1. The  ingress/egress  system must  allow  a middle-aged person, well  built,  170  cm  to  enter 
or leave the vehicle unaided, in no more than 30 seconds. 
2.2. The  visibility  in  the  seated  driving  position  must  be  at  least  150o  in  the  horizontal 
direction,  with  maximum  visibility  in  the  vertical  direction  (below  horizontal  line  of 
sight.) 
2.3. Windshield  should  resist  a  force of  550N/m2  without  deformation.  (Based on drag  force 
at 100km/h.) 
2.4. Weight  of  the windshield  system  should  be minimized,  with  a weight  per  unit  area  less 
than twice that of the shell (i.e. less than 5kg/m2).

2.5. Completed shell must be aesthetically pleasing (unquantifiable criteria). 

3.  Constraints 

3.1. The  ingress/egress  and  windshield  systems  must  mount  to  the  AHPV  steel  frame  or 
composite  shell. 
If  mounted  to  the  composite  shell,  the  shell  must  be  sufficiently 
reinforced  in  the  mounting  zone  to  prevent  deformation  of  shell  shape  at  vehicle 
operating speeds (up to 100km/h). 
3.2. The  ingress/egress  system  cannot  be  able  to  come  into  contact with  the  rear  solar  panel 
array in any configuration. 
3.3. If  vehicle  controls  are  to  be  moved  to  accommodate  ingress/egress  system,  they  must 
stay within arms length (0.75 meters) of any drivers in the specified size range. 
3.4. Total	 cost  of  the  project  should  not  exceed  $1800,  including  materials,  outside 
contracting, etc. 
3.5. Deadline for completion, including testing is Jan 30th  2007. 

4.  Interface Definition 

4.1. The external dimensions of  the ingress/egress and windshield systems will maintain  the 
shape of the existing shell. 
4.2. The  ingress/egress  and  windshield  systems  will  be  integrated  within  the  existing  steel 
structure.

5.  Verification 

The  geometry  of  the  system will  be modeled  using  CAD  software  (e.g.  Solidworks).  CAE  (e.g. 
Cosmosworks) will be used to verify load distribution, deformations under loading, etc. 

Rapid  prototypes  will  then  be  created,  for  better  visualization  of  digital  mockups,  and  human 
tests will be carried out after fabrication.
