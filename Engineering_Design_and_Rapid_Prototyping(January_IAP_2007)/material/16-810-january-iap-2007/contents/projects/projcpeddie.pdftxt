 
Included in this package are the Solidworks file of the proposed axial gap 
electrical hub motor, several graphical representations of the performance of a similar 
design, as well as, some hand written electromagnetic calculations used to choose the 
values of the design variables we considered.  The program Maxwell3D was used to 
perform our dynamic, electromagnetic analysis.  Due to technical issues with the 
program, we were unable to run the RNxprt module within the program which allows for 
sophisticated hub motor design and performance analysis.  However, using other 3D 
components we were still able to design the rotor, magnets, stator slots, and windings, 
and eventually run a dynamic analysis.  It must be noted, however, that the Solidworks 
model included in this package was designed using thorough research and handwritten 
calculations, as the program did not have the capacity to run the simulations without 
crashing. 
 
The design we used was too complex for any machine at MIT that runs 
Maxwell3D, and consequentially, we could not run our exact design in the simulator 
without a crash.  However, we did run a similar, albeit simpler, model and from this we 
were able to produce a few graphs of the motor performance vs. time.   
 
In addition to this, a list of our design variables, constraints, and performance 
criteria are included.  The overall goal was to maximize our efficiency and power density 
while maintaining the size and weight constraints given.  All of the eventual design 
variables were assigned values, and are representative of our Solidworks model.

As is evident from the (by no means complete) above list, there are many, many 
 
design variables involved with the design of systems of this complexity, some discrete 
and exclusive configurations such as pole count and core composition, some continuous 
attributes such as rotor diameter and supply voltage, and some that don't fit easily into 
either category (Hall sensor placement, for example).  In order to constrain the problem a 
bit better while still allowing for a good design, many design variables were fixed 
according to empirical evidence.  For example, motors built in an axial-flux configuration 
are known within the industry for simply having better efficiency than radial-flux motors.  
It was therefore possible for us to choose an axial-flux configuration without performing 
calculations for comparison; they have been done many times.   
 
The remaining design variables were set with previous designs in mind.  Many 
were chosen on the basis of simple principles and calculations relating to things like 
efficiency, impedance and airflow (e.g. at 90% efficiency, if the motor is to output 
10kWof power, it must be supplied 11111W by the controller, and it will have to 
dissipate the difference between the two).  Without a complicated computer simulation, it 
is nearly impossible to optimize these design variables.   
 
Although it would have been vastly preferable had the “Analyze All” feature in 
Maxwell3D been fully functional, as we could have done multiple variable analyses on 
several design variables at once while maintaining the integrity of our constraints, we 
were still able to model to a simple degree our rotating motor.  In the future, the full 
breadth of a 3D electro-magnetic motor program would need to functional for a proper 
optimization and design to occur.
