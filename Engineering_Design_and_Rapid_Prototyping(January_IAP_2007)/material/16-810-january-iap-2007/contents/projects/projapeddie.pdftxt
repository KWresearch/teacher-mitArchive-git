1.  Component Description 
VDS 2.0 needs a new hub motor designed.   It's currently using a commercial motor from 
 
NGM  that  produces  about  7  kW  of  power.    They  need  one  that  meets  similar  high-efficiency 
standards  but  that  produces  a  higher  power.    Building  a  hub  motor  that  fits  into  the  existing 
control  and  power  infrastructure  will  make  things  easier  for  everyone,  so  we  need  to  build  a 
motor that still takes 3-phase DC power. 
 
The hub motor should be powerful enough (i.e. provide enough torque) to drive the car 
on a road.  It should be durable for long-term use and should contain any internal failures 
(electromagnetic or physical) in a way that is safe for the passenger and bystanders.  It should 
also be reasonably cheap to manufacture, and it should be simple enough that we can construct it 
and test it (either ourselves or by getting external resources for manufacturing) by the end of the 
class.  We need to essentially be able to simply replace the 7kW motor with this one without 
changing the design of the rest of the vehicle's subsystems (with the exception of the controller, 
which might need reprogramming based on layout differences).   
 

2.  Functional Requirements 
1.  The motor will deliver ten kilowatts of continuous power. 
2.  The motor will be more than ninety percent efficient at forty-five miles per hour.   
3.  The motor will sustain a driving speed greater than fifty miles per hour.   
4.  The motor will provide enough torque to accelerate a combined vehicle and load 
mass of one thousand pounds from zero to sixty miles per hour in at most fifteen 
seconds.   
5.  The motor will weigh less than thirty kilograms.   

 
3.  Constraints 
1.  The motor and enclosure must fit in between the wheel and the suspension arm and 
not interfere with the hole in the outer shell of the vehicle.  The motor and its 
enclosure may not restrict the operation of the suspension arm.   
2.  The motor must not draw more power than the controller can supply.   
3.  The  motor  must  not  generate  more  torque  than  the  suspension  arm  bolt  hole  can 
support.   

 
4.  Interface Definition 

1(cid:31) 

1.  The  hub  motor  must  interface  in  a  mechanically  secure  fashion  with  the  wheel  (Fig. 
1) on one  side, with a central axle hole and  six evenly  spaced holes arranged  radially 
around  it.   Through  the wheel  it must  interface with  the suspension arm bolt hole and 
five  radially  spaced holes  (Fig. 2).   On  the other  side  it must  interface with  the  chain 
hub (Fig. 3) for the pedal drive via a 3.5‚Äù threaded column.   
2.  The hub motor must be controlled by the NGM EV-C200 motor controller (Fig. 4).   
3.  The hub motor must be powered by the solar/battery system.

.  Verification 
1.  The motor
 
 will be weighed.   
2.  The motor will be set up in a t
est  and and loaded and will have its power input and 
st
output measured (and its efficiency calculated).   
The motor will be installed in the vehicle itself, th
e vehicle will be driven and the top 
speed and average acceleration will be measured (by speedometer and by stopwatch 
respectively).
