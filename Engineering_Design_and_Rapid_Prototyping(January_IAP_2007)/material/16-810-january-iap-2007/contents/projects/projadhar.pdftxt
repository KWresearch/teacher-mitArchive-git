1.  Component Description 

 
The  NASA  Centennial  Challenges  were  created  to  help 
stimulate  interest  in  the  concept  of  a  Space  Elevator.  The 
Power  Beaming  competition  at  these  challenges  required 
teams to design a robotic climber capable of ascending 100 
meters  of  ribbon  in  50  seconds.  The  rules  dictate  that 
power  for  the  climber  can  only  come  through  an  external 
beam,  and  the  use  of  sunlight  is  strictly  prohibited. MIT’s 
Space  Elevator  Team  (MITSET)  has  chosen  microwave 
radiations  as  the  source  of  power  for  their  climber.  It  is 
NAOT’s goal to design the source of this microwave beam 
for  MITSET’s  robotic  climber.  The  ability  of  the  climber 
to  meet  the  required  2m/s  average  speed  relies  on  the 
ability  of  the  power  source  to  provide  a  continuous  beam 
of  microwave  radiation  to  the  climber’s  rectenna  array. 
This  must  be  accomplished  despite  the  rapid  oscillations 
the  climber  is  expected  to  experience  and  over  varying 
distances.  The  rectennas  also  require  a  beam  of  circularly 
polarized microwave  radiation, which must  be  created  and 
directed 
toward 
them  even 
though  most  common 
microwave  generators 
linearly 
(magnetrons)  create 
ted radiation.

2.  Functional Requirements 
 
Our  team’s  subsystem  will  necessarily  be  complex,  so  to  set  ourselves  an  achievable  goal,  we 
have separated requirements  into first-level and second-level requirements, the  latter being  those 
that MITSET would benefit from, but aren’t crucial to the system’s performance. 
 
2.1 First-Level Requirements 
 
2.1.1  The  system  must  transfer  at  least  400W  of  true  power  over  a  period  of  50  seconds  to  a 
1.8m  diameter  horizontal  rectenna  oscillating  with  an  amplitude  of  1m  situated  at  a 
varying altitude of 10 to 60m. 
If any components are added to the climber, their total weight cannot exceed 8.5kg 
If  any  components  are  added  to  the  climber,  they  must  comply  with  all  climber 
requirements  as  detailed  in  section  2.2.1  of  the  NASA  Space  Elevator  Centennial 
Challenge rulebook[1]. 

2.1.2 
2.1.3 

 
2.2 Second-Level Requirements 
 
2.2.1  The beam source must be able to be turned on. 
2.2.2  The beam source must be able to switch off in 5 seconds of a stop command. 
 

3.  Constraints 

 
3.1 The transferred power must be microwave radiation circularly polarized at 5.81GHz 
3.2 The  system  must  comply  with  any  applicable  regulations  as  well  as,  so  far  as  possible,  the 
laws of physics. 

 
 
 
 

 

4.  Interface Definition 

 
Just as with  the requirements,  this section has been divided  into primary and secondary  interface 
definitions.  Secondary  interface  definitions  are  not  crucial  to  the  system’s  integrability  with  the 
rest of MITSET’s hardware, but would benefit them if included. 
 
4.1 Primary Interface Definitions 
 
4.1.1  The  power  source  must  have  its  own  generator  or  comply  with  a  100kVA  apparent 
power,  120V  (single  phase),  208V  or  480V  (three  phase)  generator  using  a  bare  wire 
connector. 
4.1.2  The beam source must fit around a ribbon anchor connected to the ribbon, modeled as an 
immobile .5m-side cube sitting on the ground, or must provide power away from it. 

2(cid:31) 

4.1.3  The  beam  must  be  safe  for  spectators  situated  at  a  distance  of  50m  from  the  climber 
ribbon  anchor  as  well  as  for  any  operators  situated  closer  than  50m  from  the  ribbon 
anchor, or be operable from a 50m distance. 
4.1.4  The beam source must be storable in a cubic box of 1.5m side. 
4.1.5  The  beam  source  must  be  assembled  and  connected  from  its  stored  state  within  20 
minutes with a team of 2 or 15 minutes with a team of 3. 

 
4.2 Secondary Interface Definitions 
 
4.2.1  The beam must have a master off switch. 
4.2.2  The beam control box must have two 5V command output lines: “start” and “enable”.  
4.2.3  The  beam  control  connector  should  be  a  standard  mini  connector, McMaster  69355K74 
or  compatible.  This  connector  will  be  on  our  control  box.  The  beam  source  can  use  on-
line  connector  such  as  McMaster  69355K71  or  compatible,  with  enough  cable  to  reach 
our control box. 
4.2.4  The beam source must be able to stand on a semi-paved or compacted ground surface and 
must be able to level. 
If  the  beam  is  not  visible,  the  beam  source  must  have  a  visible  “beam  is  on”  indicator 
light  on  it,  and  a  5V  output  line  indicating  the  state  of  the  beam.  If  there  are  multiple 
physical beam sources, the “beam on” line should be high if any of them is on, the “beam 
on”  indicator  light  should  be  on  each  source,  and  the  “master  off”  switch  should  kill  all 
sources.  The  time  delay  between  the  command  and  the  change  in  beam  state  must  not 
exceed 1 second. 
4.2.6  The beamed electromagnetic radiation must preserve the integrity of a 110m long 100mm 
wide  vertical  ribbon  made  of  Siegler-USA  GG-25A-20  material  under  a  tension  of 
6500N. 
4.2.7  The  beamed  electromagnetic  radiation  must  preserve  the  integrity  of  a  110m  long  belay 
line of yet undefined characteristics situated 30 to 50 cm away from the ribbon. 

4.2.5 

 

5.  Verification 

 
The  team  will  be  required  to  prove  that  they  fulfill  any  secondary  interface  definitions,  or 
second-level  requirements.  The  following  tests  will  be  performed  to  verify  that  the  system 
satisfies the rest of this document: 
 
2.1.1  The design will be tested using sensitive measuring equipment to test the power output 
from a rectenna placed in the microwave beam produced by the system. It will be 
measured at varying distances up to 60m. This will take place on the track possibly with 
some shielding for the microwaves placed behind the test. 
2.1.2  Will be tested by weighing the finished system on an accurate scale. 
2.1.3  Will be met by making sure everything meets the specifications set forth in the NASA 
Space Elevator Centennial Challenge rulebook. 
3.1 The Microwave radiation transmitted will be applied to a rectenna to measure the output 
voltage. 
3.2 MIT’s safety office will be asked to verify that the system abides by all known applicable 
regulations. 

3(cid:31) 

4.1.1  Power input into the system will be carefully measured during the extent of the field test. 
4.1.2  Will be tested by building a .5m box and placing the beam source on/around it. 
4.1.3  Shielding may be used to ensure safety of spectators and the MIT safety office will help 
to ensure that the system is safe. 
4.1.4  The beam source will be disassembled and placed in a 1.5m box to demonstrate that it is 
storable. 
4.1.5  Two or three team members, as appropriate, will be timed as they assemble the beam 
source.
