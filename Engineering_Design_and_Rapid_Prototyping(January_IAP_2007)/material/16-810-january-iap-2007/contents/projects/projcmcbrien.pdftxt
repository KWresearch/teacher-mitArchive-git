1. Hard Opening 

Using Comosworks, the canopy was analysed to find out the effect of slamming it 
upwards – as if somebody had opened it a little too vigorously. 

Restraints were modeled as the two bottom edges being fixed (shown by the green 
arrows in Fig 1). This should be a reasonable approximation given we do not know the 
exact position of any holes being drilled. 

A force of 2g is applied both horizontally and vertically at the top part of the canopy, 
where somebody who was opening it from the outside is expected to grip. 

Fig 1: Loads and Restraints Applied to Canopy 

The mesh was created with default options, and at its finest setting for best accuracy. 

Fig 2: Mesh created on shell surface. 

Stress is fairly low throughout 
the canopy, exceeding yield at 
the very edges by the fixed 
restraints. As these are not 
actually our restraints, can 
assume this will not happen in 
the real case. 

Fig 3: Stress Distribution 

The displacement of the canopy is 
concentrated at the tip, which is 
what you would expect given that 
this region is the greatest distance 
from the fixed points. However, 
displacement in this position is not 
as important as it will not be in 
contact with the shell in the open 
position, and will flex back when 
the load is removed.

Strain distribution is similar to stress 
distribution.

2. Air Pressure Acting On Canopy While Driving 

As a second model, we looked at the pressure force at maximum speed, 60mph, 
(calculated in the requirements specification as 550N/m2), and how that affected the 
canopy, particularly if it could cause resonance. 

The edges of the shell were made fixed restraints as we have decided to use a magnetic 
strip to attach the canopy to the shell in the driving position. 

The force is a pressure distributed across the front surface of the canopy, opposite the 
direction of motion of the vehicle (i.e. normal to the front plane.) 

As before, a mesh was created and the analyses run. The results are shown below: 

Fig 6: Restraints and Forces 

Fig 7: Natural Modes of Vibration of the Canopy 

These natural frequencies are quite low, although when driving, it would take a lot longer 
to accelerate to 60mph and decelerate repeatedly, so the canopy shouldn’t resonate while 
driving. As shown below, the actual displacements expected driving at max speed are 
very small.

60mph 

3. Optimisation of Rail 

By changing the thickness of the rail as a variable parameter, we optimized our design for 
the case where the canopy was opened quickly. The restraints were hinge joints at each 
point where the rail is bolted to the frame and the force was a horizontal force of 80N, 
mimicking the impact of a hard opening by the driver. 

Fig 9: Factor of Safety Distribution at t=1inch (Min FoS=8.9) 

Fig 10: Factor of Safety Distribution at t=0.5inch (Min FoS=2.7) 

Fig 11: Factor of Safety Distribution at t=0.25inch (Min FoS=2.0) 

A factor of safety of 2.7 is reasonable, and a thickness of 0.25inches would have poor 
stiffness under side loads, so we will use 0.5inch thick aluminium for the rail.
