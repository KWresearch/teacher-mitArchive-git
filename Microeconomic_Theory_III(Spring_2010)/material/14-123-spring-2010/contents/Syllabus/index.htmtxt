***** Overview *****
Microeconomic Theory III is a half-semester course. This course covers the
topics in Microeconomic Theory that everybody with a Ph.D. from MIT Economics
Department should know but have not yet been covered in the Micro sequence.
Hence, it covers several unrelated topics. I will try my best to put them in a
coherent narrative, but there will be inherent jumps from topic to topic. More
importantly for you, it is not possible to use a single textbook. To alleviate
the problem, I will refer to the textbooks that are used in other parts of the
sequence as much as it is possible, and I will fill the remaining gaps with
lecture notes and few articles.
***** Prerequisites *****
14.121, 14.122, and permission of instructor.
***** Readings *****
There are three main texts used in this course:
[Buy_at_Amazon] Mas-Colell, Andreu, Michael Whinston, and Jerry Green.
Microeconomic Theory. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1995. ISBN:
9780195073409.
[Buy_at_Amazon] Kreps, David. A Course in Microeconomic Theory. Princeton, NJ:
Princeton University Press, 1990. ISBN: 9780745007625.
[Buy_at_Amazon] Fudenberg, Drew, and Jean Tirole. Game Theory. Cambridge, MA:
MIT_Press, 1991. ISBN: 9780262061414.
***** Course Description *****
The topics come from three general areas:
    * Standard Decision Theory
    * Game Theory
    * Behavioral Economics
Behavioral Economics involves both single-person decision problems, as in
Decision Theory, and multi-person decision problems as in Game Theory.Â 
Accordingly, I will present the behavioral economics topics under the other two
topics. Given the length of the course, I will be able to present these topics
only as examples of how one can enrich the theory by incorporating behavioral
issues.
The Decision Theory section is based on Chapter 6 of Microeconomic Theory.
Since this text does not do any justice to subjective expected utility
maximization, I will also provide lecture notes on that subject. Savageâs own
book (The Foundations of Statistics) is probably the best and clearest source
available in the topic. I will conclude with three topics from Behavioral
Decision Theory: Rabinâs critique of Expected Utility Theory, Prospect
Theory, and Hyperbolic Discounting.
The Game Theory section is more eclectic. In that part I will introduce some
important ideas in theory, such as reputation formation, as well as important
applications of Game Theory, such as collusion and bargaining. As examples of
application of important behavioral ideas in Game Theory, I will present
optimism and hyperbolic discounting in bargaining.
