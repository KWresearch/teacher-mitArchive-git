1.	

Risk v. uncertainty 
Risk = DM has to choose from alternatives 
  whose consequences are unknown 
  But the probability of each consequence is given 
2.	 Uncertainty = DM has to choose from alternatives 
  whose consequences are unknown 
the probability of consequences is not given 
 
  DM has to form his own beliefs 
3.  Von Neumann-Morgenstern: Risk 
4.  Goal: 
1.  Convert uncertainty to risk by formalizing and eliciting beliefs 
2.  Apply Von Neumann Morgenstern analysis

Model 
	 C = Finite set of consequences 
	 S = A set of states (uncountable) 
	 Act: A mapping f : S → C 
	 X = F := CS 
	 DM cares about consequences, chooses an 
act, without knowing the state 
	 Example: Should I take my umbrella? 
	 Example: A game from a player’s point of view 

Expected-Utility Representation 

  ≽ = a relation on F 
  Expected-Utility Representation: 
  A probability distribution p on S with expectation E 
  A VNM utility function u : C → R such that 
f ≽ g Ù U(f) ≡ E[u◦f] ≥ E[u◦g] ≡ U(g) 
 
  Necessary Conditions: 
P1: ≽  is a preference relation

Sure-Thing Principle 

	 If 
  f ≽ g when DM knows B ⊆ S occurs, 
  f ≽ g when DM knows S\B occurs, 
  Then f ≽ g

  when DM doesn’t know whether B occurs or not. 

P2: Let f,f′,g,g′ and B be such that 

  f(s) = f′(s) and g(s) = g′(s) at each s ∈ B

  f(s) = g(s) and f′(s) = g′(s) at each s ∈ S\B.

Then, f ≽ g Ù f′ ≽ g′.

Conditional Preference 

  For any acts f and h and event B, 
⎧ f (s ) 
if  s ∈ B
|B ( ) = ⎨
f h s 
⎩h( s)  otherwise 
  Definition: f ≽ g given B iff f|B
h≽ g|B
h.  

  Sure-Thing Principle = conditional preference is well-defined

Informal Sure-Thing Principle, formally:

 
f≽ g|B
f ≽ g given B:  f|B
f.

 
g≽ g|S\B . 
f ≽ g given S\B:  f|S\B
g

 
f≽ g|B
g≽ g|S\B
  Transitivity: f = f|B
g = g. 
f = f|S\B
  B is null Ù  f ~ g given B for all f,g∈F. 
P3: For any x,x′∈C, f,f′∈F with f≡x and f′≡x′, and any non-null B, 
f≽f′ given B Ù x≽x′.

Eliciting Beliefs

Definition: For any A,B ⊆ S, 
x,x’  ≽ fB
A ≽ B Ù fA
for some x,x′ ∈ C with x ≻ x′. 
  A ≽ B means A is at least as likely as B. 
P4: There exist x, x′ ∈ C such that x ≻ x′. 
P5: For all A,B ⊆ S, x,x′,y,y′ ∈ C with x≻x′ and y≻y′, 
x,x’  ≽ fB
y,y’  ≽ fB

Qualitative Probability 

Definition: A relation ≽ between the events is 
said to be a qualitative probability iff 
1.  ≽  is complete and transitive; 
for any B,C,D ⊆ S with B∩D=C∩D=∅, 
2.	
B≽C Ù B∪D≽C∪D; 
3.  B≽∅ for each B ⊆ S, and S ≻∅. 
Fact: “At least as likely as” relation above is a 
qualitative probability relation. 

Quantifying qualitative probability 

  For any probability measure p and relation ≽ on 
events, p is a probability representation of ≽  iff 
B≽C Ù p(B) ≥ p(C)  ∀B,C⊆S. 
  If ≽ has a probability representation, then ≽  is a 
qualitative probability. 
  S is infinitely divisible under ≽  iff ∀n, S has a partition 
{D1
1, …, Dn
n} such that D1
1 ~  … ~Dn  . 
n
P6: For any x∈C, g,h ∈ F with g≻h, S has a partition
{D¹,…,Dⁿ} s.t. 
x ≻ h 
g ≻ hi
x  and gi
x(s) = x if s ∈ Di  and h(s) otherwise. 
for all i≤n where  hi
  P6 implies that S is infinitely divisible under ≽.

Probability Representation 

Theorem: Under P1-P6, ≽ has a unique probability
representation p. 
Proof: 
  For any event B and n, define 
k(n,B) = max {r | B ≽ D1
	 Define p(B) = limn k(n,B)/2n. 
	 B≽C ⇒ k(n,B) ≥ k(n,C) ∀n ⇒ p(B) ≥ p(C). 
	 P6’: If B≻C, S has a partition {D¹,…,Dⁿ} s.t. B≻C ∪ 
Di  for each i≤n. 
	 B≻C ⇒ p(B) > p(C). 
	 Uniqueness: k(n,B)/2n  ≤ p′(B) < (k(n,B)+1)/2ⁿ

Expected Utility Maximization – 
Characterization 
Theorem: Assume that C is finite. Under P1-P6, 
there exist a utility function u : C → R and a 
probability measure p on S such that ∀f,g∈ F,
