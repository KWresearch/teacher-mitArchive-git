Model 

  C = R = wealth level 
  Lottery = cdf F (pdf f) 
  Utility function u : R→R 
  U(F) ≡ EF(u) ≡ ∫u(x)dF(x) 
  EF(x) ≡ ∫xdF(x)

Attitudes Towards Risk 

DM is 
  risk averse if EF(u) ≤ u(EF(x))  (∀F) 
 
  strictly risk averse if EF(u) <  u(EF(x))  (∀ “risky” F) 
 
 
  risk neutral if EF(u) =  u(EF(x))  (∀F) 
  risk seeking if EF(u) ≥  u(EF(x))  (∀F) 
 
DM is 
  risk averse if u is concave 
  strictly risk averse if u is strictly concave 
  risk neutral if u is linear 
  risk seeking if u is convex 

Certainty Equivalence 

CE(F) = u⁻¹(U(F))=u⁻¹(EF(u)) 
 
  DM is 
  risk averse if CE(F) ≤ EF(x) for all F; 
  risk neutral if CE(F) = EF(x) for all F; 
  risk seeking if CE(F) ≥ EF(x) for all F. 
  Take DM1 and DM2 with u1  and u2. 
  DM1 is more risk averse than DM2 
 Ù u1  is more concave than u2, 

 Ù u1 = φ◦ u2  for some concave function φ, 

 Ù CE1(F) ≡ u1⁻¹(EF(u1)) ≤ u2⁻¹(EF(u2)) ≡ CE2(F)

Absolute Risk Aversion 

	 absolute risk aversion: 
rA(x) = -u′′(x)/u′(x) 
  constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) 
u(x) =-e-αx 
	 If x ~ N(μ,σ²),  CE(F) = μ - ασ²/2 
	 Fact: More risk aversion Ù higher absolute risk 
aversion everywhere 
	 Fact: Decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) 
Ù ∀y>0, u2  with u2(x)≡u(x+y) is less risk averse 

Relative risk aversion: 

	 relative risk aversion: 
rR(x) = -xu′′(x)/u′(x) 
  constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) 
u(x)=-x1-ρ/(1-ρ), 
	 When ρ = 1, u(x) = log(x). 
	 Fact: Decreasing relative risk aversion (DRRA) 
Ù ∀t>1, u2  with u2(x)≡u(tx) is less risk averse

Application: Insurance 
  wealth w and a loss of $1 with probability p.  

  Insurance: pays $1 in case of loss costs q;  

  DM buys λ units of insurance.

  Fact: If p = q (fair premium), then λ = 1 (full

insurance). 
■ Expected wealth w – p for all λ. 
	 Fact: If DM1 buys full insurance, a more risk 
averse DM2 also buys full insurance. 
	 CE2(λ) ≤ CE1(λ) ≤ CE1(1) = CE2(1). 

Application: Optimal Portfolio Choice 
	 With initial wealth w, invest α ∈ [0,w] in a risky asset 
that pays a return z per each $ invested; z has cdf F 
on [0,∞). 
∞ u(w+αz-α) dF(z); concave 
	 U(α) = ∫0 
	 It is optimal to invest α > 0 iff E[z] > 1. 
∞ u’(w)(z-1) dF(z) = u’(w)(E[z]-1). 
■ U’(0) = ∫0 
  If agent with utility u1  optimally invests α1, then an 
agent with more risk averse u2  (same w) optimally
invests α2  ≤ α1. 
  DARA ⇒ optimal α  increases in w. 
  CARA ⇒ optimal α  is constant in w. 
  CRRA (DRRA) ⇒ optimal α/w is constant (increasing)

Optimal Portfolio Choice – Proof 

	 u2=g(u1); g is concave; g’(u1(w)) = 1. 
	 Ui(α) ≡ ∫ui(w+α(z-1))(z-1) dF(z) 
  U2’(α)- U1’(α) = ∫[u2(w+α(z-1))- u1(w+α(z-1))](z-1)dF(z) 
≤ 0. 
  g’(u1(w+α1z-α1)) < g’(u1(w)) = 1 Ù z > 1. 
  u2(w+α(z-1)) < u1(w+α(z-1)) Ù z > 1. 
	 α2  ≤ α1 

Stochastic Dominance 

	 Goal: Compare lotteries with minimal assumptions 
on preferences 
	 Assume that the support of all payoff distributions is 
bounded.  Support = [a,b]. 
  Two main concepts: 
  First-order Stochastic Dominance:  A payoff distribution 
is preferred by all monotonic Expected Utility 
preferences. 
	 Second-order Stochastic Dominance:  A payoff  

distribution is preferred by all risk averse EU

preferences.

FSD 

  DEF: F first-order stochastically dominates G Ù 
F(x) ≤ G(x) for all x. 
  THM: F first-order stochastically dominates G Ù  for every 
weakly increasing u: →, ∫u(x)dF(x) ≥ ∫u(x)dG(x). 
Proof:

  “If:” for F(x*) > G(x*), define u = 1{x>x*}. 

  “Only if”: Assume F and G  are strictly increasing and

continuous on [a,b]. 
  Define y(x) = F-1(G(x)); y(x) ≥ x for all x 
  ∫u(y)dF(y) = ∫u(y(x))dF(y(x)) = ∫u(y(x))dG(x) ≥ ∫u(x)dG(x) 

MPR and MLR Stochastic Orders 


  DEF: F dominates G in the Monotone Probability
Ratio (MPR) sense if k(x) ≡ G(x)/F(x) is weakly
decreasing in x. 
  THM: MPR dominance implies FSD. 
  DEF: F dominates G in the Monotone Likelihood 
Ratio (MLR) sense if ℓ(x) ≡ G’(x)/F’(x) is weakly 
decreasing. 
  THM: MLR dominance implies MPR dominance.

SSD 

  Assume: F and G has the same mean 
  DEF: F second-order stochastically dominates G Ù for 
every non-decreasing concave u, ∫u(x)dF(x) ≥ ∫u(x)dG(x). 
  DEF: G is a mean-preserving spread of F Ù y = x + ε  for 
some x ~ F, y ~ G, and ε with E[ε|x] = 0. 
  THM: The following are equivalent: 
  F second-order stochastically dominates G. 
  G is a mean-preserving spread of F . 
tG(x)dx ≥ ∫0 
tF(x)dx. 
  ∀t ≥ 0, ∫0

	 Example: G (dotted) is a mean-preserving
spread of F (solid).
