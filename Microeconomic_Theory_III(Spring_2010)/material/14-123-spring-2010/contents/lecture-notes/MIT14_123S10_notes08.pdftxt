Rationalizability 

The  deﬁnition  of  a  game  (N , S, u1 , . . . , un)  implicitly  assumes  that 

1.  the  set  of  players  is  N ,  the  set  of  available  strategies  to  a  player  i  is  Si , and  the 
player  i  tries  to  maximize  the  expected  value  of  ui  :  S
R  according to some 
→ 
belief,  and  that 

2.	 each  player  knows  1,  and  that 

3.	 each  player  knows  2,  and  that

ad  inﬁnitum. 

That  is,  it  is  implicitly  assumed  that  it  is  common  know ledge  among  the  players 
that  the  game  is  (N , S, u1 , . . . , un)  and  that players  are  rational  (i.e.  they  are  expected 
utility  maximizers).  As  a  solution  concept,  Rationalizability  yields  the  strategies  that 
are  consistent with  these assumptions,  capturing what  is  implied by  the model  (i.e.  the 
game).  Other solution  concepts  impose  further assumptions, usually on players’ beliefs, 
to  obtain  sharper  predictions.  In  this  lecture,  I will  formally  introduce  rationalizability 
and  present  some  of  its  applications.  The  outline  is  as  follows.  I  will  ﬁrst  illustrate  the 
idea  on  a  simple  example.  I  will  then  present  the  formal  theory.  I  will  ﬁnally  apply 
rationalizability  to Cournot  and Bertrand  competitions.

(8.1) 

A  player  is  said  to  be  rational  if  he  plays  a  best  response  to  a  belief  about  the  other 
players’  strategies.  What  does  rationality  imply  for  this  game? 
Consider Player 1.  He is contemplating about whether to play T, or M, or B. A quick 
inspection  of  his payoﬀs reveals  that  his best play depends on what he thinks the  other 
player  does.  Let’s  then  write  p  for  the  probability  he  assigns  to  L  (as  Player  2’s  play), 
representing  his  belief  about  Player  2’s  strategy.  His  expected  payoﬀs from  playing  T, 
M,  and B are 

UT  = 2p − (1 − p) = 3p − 1, 
UM  = 0, 
UB  =  −p + 2(1 − p) = 2 − 3p, 
respectively.  These  values  as  a  function  of  p  are  plotted  in  the  following  graph: 
U 

UB

8.1.  EXAMPLE 

75 

As it is clear from the graph, UT  is the largest when p > 1/2, and UB  is the largest when 
p < 1/2. At  p = 1/2,  UT  = UB  > 0.  Hence,  if  player  1  is  rational,  then  he  will  play  B 
when  p < 1/2, D when  p > 1/2, and B  or D  if  p = 1/2. 

Notice  that,  if  Player  1  is  rational,  then  he  will  never  play  M–no  matter  what  he 
believes  about  the  Player  2’s  play.  Therefore,  if  we  assume  that  Player  1  is  rational 
(and  that  the  game  is  as  it  is  described  above),  then  we  can  conclude  that  Player  1 
will  not  play  M.  This  is  because  M  is  a  strictly  dominated  strategy.  In  particular,  the 
mixed  strategy  that puts probability 1/2  on T and probability 1/2  on B yields  a higher 
expected  payoﬀ  than  strategy  M  no  matter  what  (pure)  strategy  Player  2  plays.  A 
consequence  of  this  is  that M  is  never  a weak  best  response  to  a  belief  p,  a  general  fact 
that will  be  established momentarily. 

We  now  want  to  understand  the  implications  of  the  assumption  that  players  know 
that  the  other  players  are  also  rational.  Now,  rationality  of  player  1  requires  that  he 
does  not  play M.  For  Player  2,  her  both  actions  can  be  a  best  reply.  If  she  thinks  that 
Player  1 is not  likely  to  play M,  then  she must play R, and  if  she thinks that it is very 
likely  that  Player  1  will  play  M,  then  she  must  play  L.  Hence,  rationality  of  player  2 
does  not  put  any  restriction  on  her  behavior.  But,  what  if  she  thinks  that  it  is  very 
likely  that  player  1  is  rational  (and  that  his  payoﬀ  are  as  in  (8.1))?  In  that  case,  since 
a  rational  player 1  does  not  play M,  she must  assign  very  small  probability  for player  1 
playing M.  In  fact,  if  she knows  that player 1  is  rational,  then  she must  be  sure  that he 
will  not  play M.  In  that  case,  being  rational,  she must  play R.  In  summary,  if  player  2 
is  rational  and  she  knows  that  player  1  is  rational,  then  she  must  play R. 

Notice  that  we  ﬁrst  eliminated  all  of  the  strategies  that  are  strictly  dominated 
(namely  M),  then  taking  the  resulting  game,  we  eliminated  again  all  of  the  strate-
gies  that  are  strictly  dominated  (namely  L).  This  is  called  twice  iterated  elimination  of 
strictly  dominated  strategies.  The  resulting  strategies  are  the  strategies  that  are  consis-
tent with the assumption that players are rational and they know that the other players 
are  rational. 

As we  impose  further  assumptions  about  rationality, we  keep  iteratively  eliminating 
all  strictly dominated  strategies  (if  there remains any).  Recall  that  rationality of player 
1  requires  him  to  play  T  or  B,  and  knowledge  of  the  fact  that  player  2  is  also  rational 
does not put any restriction on his behavior–as rationality itself does not restrict Player 

76 

CHAPTER 8.  RATIONALIZABILITY 

2’s behavior.  Now, assume that Player 1 also knows (i) that Player 2  is rational and (ii) 
that  Player  2  knows  that  Player  1  is  rational  (and  that  the  game  is  as  in  (8.1)).  Then, 
as the above analysis snows, Player 1 must know that Player 2 will play R. In that case, 
being rational he must play B. Therefore, common knowledge of rationality implies that 
Player  1  plays B  and Player  2 plays R. 
In  the  next  section,  I will  apply  these  ideas more  generally. 

8.2  Theory 

Fix a game (N , S, u1 , . . . , un).  To be concrete, deﬁne the concepts of belief, best response, 
and  rationality  as  follows. 

Deﬁnition  26  For any player i, a (correlated) belief of i about the other players’ strate-
gies  is  a  probability  distribution  μ on  S−i  = Qj=i Sj .
−i 
The essential part of this deﬁnition is that the belief μ
−i  of player i allows correlation 
between  the  other  players’  strategies.  For  example,  in  a  game  of  three  players  in which 
each  player  is  to  choose between Left  and Right, Player 1 may believe  that with proba-
bility 1/2 both of  the other players will play Left and with probability 1/2 both players 
will  play  Right.  Hence,  viewed  as  mixed  strategies,  it may  appear  as  though  Players  2 
and  3  use  a  common  randomization  device,  contradicting  the  fact  that  Players  2  and  3 
make  their  decisions  independently.  One  may  then  ﬁnd  such  a  correlated  belief  unrea-
sonable.  This  line  of  reasoning  is  based  on mistakenly  identifying  a  player’s  belief  with 
other players’ conscious randomization.  For Player 1 to have such a correlated belief, he 
does  not  need  to  believe  that  the  other players  choose  their  decisions  together.  Indeed, 
he does not think that the other players are using randomization device.  He thinks that 
each  of  the  other  players  play  a  pure  strategy  that  he  does  not  know.  He  may  assign 
correlated  probabilities  on  the  other  players  strategies  because  he  may  assign  positive 
probability to various theories and each of these theories may lead to a prediction about 
how  the  players  play.  For  example,  he may  think  that  players  play  Left  (as  in  the  cars 
in  England)  or  players  play  Right  (as  in  the  cars  in  France)  without  knowing  which  of 
the theories is correct. 
Depending on whether one allows  correlated beliefs,  there are  two versions of Ratio-
nalizability.  Because  of  the  above  reasoning,  in  this  course,  I  will  focus  on  correlated 

6
8.2.  THEORY

version  of  Rationalizability.  Note  that  the  original  deﬁnitions  of  Bernheim  (1985)  and 
Pearce (1985) impose independence, and these concepts are identical in two player games. 

Deﬁnition  27  The  expected  payoﬀ  from  a  strategy  si  against  a  belief  μ
−i  is

¡
−i  =

Deﬁnition  28  For  any  player  i, a  strategy  s∗

ui (si , s−i ) μ
−i  (s−i ) . 

ui (s∗ 
−i) ≥ ui(si , μ
−i), ∀si  ∈ Si . 
i , μ
Here  I  use  the  notion  of  a  weak  best  reply,  requiring  that  there  is  no  other  strategy 
that yields a strictly higher payoﬀ against the belief.  A notion of strict best reply would 
require  that  s∗  yields  a  strictly  higher  expected  payoﬀ  than  any  other  strategy. 

Deﬁnition  29  For  any  player  i, playing  a  strategy  si  is  said  to  be  rational  if  and  only 
if  si  is  a  best  response  to  some  belief  μ
−i . 
Playing  a  strategy  is  not  rational  if  and  only  if  it  is  never  a  weak  best  reply.  This 
idea  of  rationality  is  closely  related  to  the  following  notion  of  dominance. 

Deﬁnition  30  A strategy  s∗ 
i  strictly  dominates  si  if  and  only  if 

ui(s∗ 
i , s−i) > ui(si , s−i), ∀s−i  ∈ S−i . 
P 
Similarly, a mixed strategy σ i  strictly dominates si  if and only if ui (σ i , s−i ) ≡ 
s0i∈Si 
ui(si , s−i), ∀s−i  ∈ S−i . 
That  is,  no  matter  what  the  other  players  play,  playing  s∗ 
i  is  strictly  better  than 
playing  si  for  player  i.  In  that  case,  if  i  is  rational,  he  would  never  play  the  strictly 
dominated  strategy  si .  That  is,  there  is  no  belief  under  which  he  would  play  si , for  s∗ 
i 
would  always  yield  a  higher  expected  payoﬀ  than  si  no  matter  what  player  i  believes 
about  the  other  players.1 

σ i(si0 )ui(si0 , s−i) > 

Deﬁnition  31  A strategy  si  is  said  to  be  strictly  dominated  if  and  only  if  there  exists 
a  pure  or  mixed  strategy  that  strictly  dominates  si .

CHAPTER 8.  RATIONALIZABILITY

Nevertheless,  M  is  dominated  by  the  mixed  strategy  that  σ1  that  puts  probability  1/2 
on  each  of T  and B. For  each  p,  the  payoﬀ  from σ1  is

which  is  larger  than  0,  the  payoﬀ  from M.  Recall  that  in  our  example  there  is  no  belief 
(p)  under which M  is  a  best  response.  This  is  indeed a  general  result:

Theorem  9  Playing  a  strategy  si  is  not  rational  for  i  (i.e.  si  is  never  a  weak  best 
response  to  a  belief  μ
−i) if and  only  if  si  is  strictly  dominated. 
Proof.  I  will  only  show  that  if  si  is  not  strictly  dominated  it  is  a  weak  best  response 
to  some  belief.  (The  converse  is  straightforward.)  For  each mixed  strategy  σ i , consider 
the  utility  vector 

(cid:129)ui  (σ i) = (ui  (σ i , s−i ))s−i∈S−i 
and  let  Ui  be  the  set  of  all  such  vectors.  Clearly,  Ui  is  convex.  Take  any  si  that  is  not 
strictly  dominated,  and deﬁne 

, 

ª 
©
Vi  =  v ∈ RS |v À (cid:129)ui (si)  . 
−i
Clearly, Vi  is also convex, and since si  is not  strictly dominated, Ui ∩ Vi  = ∅. Hence, by 
the separating-hyperplane theorem there exists μ
−i  ∈ RS−i  such that μ
−i · ((cid:129)ui (σ i ) − vi ) ≤ 
0  for  all  (cid:129)ui (σ i)  ∈  Ui  and  v  ∈  Vi . By  deﬁnition  of  Vi ,  μ
−i  ≥  0. Since  (cid:129)ui  (si)  is  on  the 
boundary of Vi , it is also true that for all (cid:129)ui  (σ i) ∈ Ui , μ
−i · ((cid:129)ui  (σ i) − (cid:129)ui  (si)) ≤ 0, showing 
that

(In  this  proof,  one  can  allow S−i  to  be  inﬁnite.) 
Theorem  9  states  that  if  we  assume  that  players  are  rational  (and  that  the  game  is 
as  described),  then we  conclude  that  no  player  plays  a  strategy  that  is  strictly  dominated 
(by  some  mixed  or  pure  strategy),  and  this  is  al l  we  can  conclude. 
Let  us write

1  is  the  set  of  all  strategies  that  are  best  response  to  some  belief. 
By Theorem  9,  Si 
Let  us  now  explore  the  implications  of  the  assumption  that  player  i  is  rational  and 
knows  that  the  other  players  are  rational.  To  this  end,  we  consider  the  strategies  si 
that  are  best  response  to  a  belief  μ
−i  of  i  on  S−i  such  that  for  each  s−i  = (sj )j=i  with 
−i  (s−i ) >  0 and  for  each  j ,  there  exists  a  belief  μj  of  j  on  S−j  such  that  sj  is  a  best 
μ
response to μj .  Here, the ﬁrst part (i.e.  si  is a best response to a belief μ
−i) corresponds 
to rationality of  i and the second part (i.e.  if μ
−i (s−i) > 0, then sj  is a best response to 
a belief μj )  corresponds  to  the assumption  that  i  knows  that  j  is  rational.  By Theorem 
1 .  Hence, by another application of 
9,  each  such sj  is not  strictly dominated,  i.e.,  sj  ∈ Sj 
1 
Theorem  9,  si  is  not  strictly  dominated  given  S
i ,  i.e.,  there  does  not  exist  a  (possibly 
−
mixed)  strategy  σ i  such  that 

ui (σ i , s−i) > ui  (si , s−i )

∀s−i  ∈ S

Of  course,  by Theorem 9,  the  converse of  the  last  statement  is  also true.  Therefore,  the 
set  of  strategies  that  are  rationally played by player  i  knowing  that  the  other  players  is 
also  rational  is

By  iterating  this  logic,  one  obtains  the  following  iterative  elimination  procedure, 
called  iterative  elimination  of  strictly-dominated  strategies.

Caution:  Two  points  are  crucial: 

1.  We eliminate only the strictly dominated strategies.  We do not eliminate a strategy 
if  it  is  weakly  dominated  but  not  strictly  dominated.  For  example,  we  do  not

although  (T,L)  is  a  dominant  strategy  equilibrium. 

2.  We  do  eliminate  the  strategies  that  are  strictly  dominated  by  mixed  strategies 
(but  not necessarily by pure  strategies).  For  example,  in  the  game  in  (8.1), we do 
eliminate M although  neither T nor B dominates M. 

Notice  that  when  there  are  only  ﬁnitely  many  strategies,  this  elimination  process 
must  stop  at  some  m,  i.e.,  there  will  be  no  dominated  strategy  to  eliminate  after  a 
round.

Note  that,  for  any m, a  strategy  si  is  in  Si
i  in  a  situation  in  which  (1)  i  is  rational,  (2)  i  knows  that  every  player  is  rational,  i 
knows that everybody knows that every body is rational, and . . .  (m) i know that every 
body  knows  that  . . . everybody  knows  that  everybody  is  rational.  That  is,  si  is  a  best

are  consistent with mth-order mutual  knowledge  of  rationality. 

Exercise  12  Using  Theorem  9,  prove  the  claim  in  the  previous  paragraph. 

Rationalizability  corresponds  to  the  limit  of  the  iterative  elimination  of  strictly-
dominated  strategies. 

Deﬁnition  33  (Rationalizability)  For  any  player  i,  a  strategy  is  said  to  be  rational-
izable  if  and  only  if  si  ∈ Si∞  where

Rationalizability corresponds to the set of strategies that are rationally played in sit-
uations in which it is common knowledge that everybody is rational, as deﬁned at the be-
ginning of the lecture.  When a strategy si  is rationalizable it can be justiﬁed/rationalized

by  an  indeﬁnite  chain  of  beliefs  μ
−i  as  above.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  strategy  is  not 
rationalizable, it must have been eliminated at some stage m, and such a strategy cannot 
be  rationalized  by  a  chain  of  beliefs  longer  than m. 
We  call  the  elimination  process  that  keeps  iteratively  eliminating  all  strictly  dom-
inated  strategies  until  there  is  no  strictly  dominated  strategy  Iterated  Elimination  of 
Strictly Dominated Strategies ; we eliminate indeﬁnitely if the process does not stop.  We 
call  a  strategy  rationalizable  if  and  only  if  it  survives  iterated  elimination  of  strictly 
dominated  strategies. 

Nash  Equilibrium  v.  Rationalizability  Every  Nash  equilibrium  is  rationalizable, 
which can be shown as a straightforward exercise.  Converse is not true.  For example,  in 
The Battle of The Sexes, (Opera, Ballet) is not a Nash equilibrium, but both Opera and 
Ballet are rationalizable strategies.  Of course,  these strategies correspond to some Nash 
equilibria,  but  one  can  easily  construct  a  game  in  which  some  rationalizable  strategies 
do  not  correspond to  any Nash  equilibrium. 

Exercise  13  Show that if σ∗ (si ) > 0  for some Nash equilibrium σ∗ , then si  ∈ Si∞ . Find 
i 
a game  (N , S, u1 , . . . , un)  and  a  strategy  si  ∈ Si∞  such  that  no  Nash  equilibrium  assigns

Notice that, in this game, each player tries to play a strategy that is equal to two thirds of 
the average strategy, which is also aﬀected by his own strategy.  Each person is therefore 
interested  guessing  the  other  players’  average  strategies,  which  depends  on  the  other 
players’  estimate of  the  average  strategy.  Let’s  apply our procedure  to  this  game. 
First,  since  each  strategy  must  be  less  than  or  equal  to  100,  the  average  cannot 
exceed  100,  and  hence  any  strategy  xi  > 200/3  is  strictly  dominated by  200/3.  Indeed,

the  only  rationalizable  strategy  is  xi  = 0. 
Notice  that  the  speed  at  which  x goes  to  zero  determines  how  fast  we  eliminate

the  strategies.  If  the  elimination  is  slow  (e.g.  when  2 (n − 1) / (3n − 2)  is  large),  then 
many strategies are eliminated at very high iterations.  In that case, predictions based on 
rationalizability will heavily rely on strong assumptions about rationality, i.e., everybody 
knows that everybody knows that ...  everybody is rational.  For example,  if n  is small or 
the  ratio  2/3  is  replaced  by  a  small  number,  the  elimination  is  fast  and  the  predictions 
of  rationalizability  are  more  reliable.  If  the  n  is  large  or  the  ratio  2/3  is  replaced  by  a 
number close to 1, the elimination is slow and the predictions of rationalizability are less 
reliable.  In  particular,  the  predictions  of  rationalizability  for  this  game  is  more  robust 
in  a  small  group  than  a  larger  group. 

A general problem with rationalizability is that there are usually too many rationaliz-
able strategies;  the elimination process usually stops too early.  In that case a researcher 
cannot  make  much  prediction  based  on  such  analysis.  For  example,  in  the  Matching 
Pennies  game

every  strategy  is  rationalizable,  and we  cannot  say what  the  players will  do.

8.3.1  Cournot  Competition 

Consider  n  ﬁrms.  Each  ﬁrm  i  produces  qi  ≥  0 units  of  a  good  at  marginal  cost  c  ≥  0 
and  sell  it  at  price 

P	 = max {1 − Q, 0}

i  is

π i  = qi  (P  − c) .	
Assuming all of the above is commonly known, we can write this as a game in normal 
form,  by  setting 

(8.6) 

•	 N  = {1, 2, . . . , n}  as  the  set  of  players 
•	 Si  = [0, ∞) as the strategy space of player i, where a typical strategy is the quantity 
qi  produced by  ﬁrm  i, and 

•	 π i  : S1  × · · · × Sn  → R  as  the  payoﬀ  function. 

Best Response  In our analysis, and in the rest of the course, it will be useful to know 
the  best  response  of  a  ﬁrm  i  to  the  production  levels  of  the  other  ﬁrms.  Let  us write 
X 
qj 
j=i
for  the  total  supply of  the ﬁrms other  than ﬁrm i. If Q−i  > 1,  then  the price P  = 0 and 
the  best  ﬁrm  i  can  do  is  to  produce  zero  and  obtain  zero  proﬁt.  Now  assume  Q−i  ≤ 1. 
For  any  qi  ∈ (0, 1 − Q−i ),  the  proﬁt of the  ﬁrm  i  is 
π i  (qi , Q−i ) = qi  (1 − qi  − Q−i  − c) .

Rationalizability  The (linear) Cournot duopoly game we consider here is "dominance 
solvable"  i.e.  there  is  a  unique  rationalizable  strategy.  Let  us  ﬁrst  consider  the  ﬁrst 
couple  rounds  of  elimination  to  see  this  intuitively;  we  will  then  show  mathematically 
that  this  is  indeed  the  case. 

Round  1  Notice that a strategy qˆi  > (1 − c) /2  is strictly dominated by (1 − c) /2. 
To  see  this,  consider  any  qj . As  in  Figure  8.1,  π i  (qi , qj )  is  strictly  increasing  until 
qi  = (1 − c − qj ) /2  and  strictly  decreasing  thereafter.  In  particular, 
π i ((1 − c − qj ) /2, qj ) ≥ π i ((1 − c) /2, qj ) > π i  ( ˆqi , qj ) , 
showing  that  qˆi  is  strictly  dominated  by  (1 − c) /2.  We  therefore  eliminate  all  qˆi  > 
(1 − c) /2  for  each  player  i.  The  resulting  strategies  are  as  follows,  where  the  shaded

Round  2  In  the  remaining  game  qj  ≤  (1 − c) /2.  Consequently,  any  strategy 
qˆi  <  (1 − c) /4  is  strictly  dominated  by  (1 − c) /4.  To  see  this,  take  any  qj  ≤  (1 − c) /2 
and  recall  from Figure  8.1  that  π i  is  strictly  increasing  until  qi  = (1 − c − qj ) /2, which 
is  greater than or equal  to(1 − c) /4.  Hence, 
π i ( ˆqi , qj ) < π i  ((1 − c) /4, qj ) ≤ π i  ((1 − c − qj ) /2, qj ) ,

Notice  that  the  remaining  game  is  a  smaller  replica  of  the  original  game.  Applying  the 
same  procedure  repeatedly  we  eliminate  all  strategies  except  for  the  Nash  equilibrium. 
(After every two rounds, we obtain a smaller replica.)  Therefore, the only rationalizable 
strategy  is  the  unique Nash  equilibrium  strategy: 
q∗  = (1 − c) /3.

A more formal treatment  We can prove this more formally by invoking the following 
lemma  repeatedly: 
Lemma  2  Given  that  qj  ≤ q¯,  every  strategy  qˆi  with  qˆi  < qi
B  ( ¯q)  is  strictly  dominated  by

Theorem  10  The  set  of  remaining  strategies  after  any  odd  round  m  (m = 1, 3, . . .) is 
[qm−1 , qm ].  The  set  of  remaining  strategies  after  any  even  round  m  (m  = 2, 4, . . .) is 
m[q , qm−1 ].The  set  of  rationalizable  strategies  is  {(1 − c) /3}. 
Proof.  We  use mathematical  induction  on m. For m = 1,  we have already  proven  the 
statement.  Assume that the statement is true for some odd m. Then, for any qj  available 
at even round m + 1, we have qm−1  ≤ qj  ≤ q .  Hence, by Lemma 2, any qˆi  < qi
B  (qm) = 
m
qm+1  is  strictly  dominated by  qm+1  and  eliminated.  That  is,  if  qi  survives  round m + 1, 
then  qm+1  ≤  qi  ≤  qm .  On  the  other  hand,  every  qi  ∈  [qm+1 , qm ] =  £

is  a  best  response  to  some  qj  with  qm−1  ≤ qj  ≤ qm ,  and  it  is  not  eliminated.  Therefore, 
the  set  of  strategies  that  survive  the  even  round m + 1 is  [qm+1 , qm ]. 
Now,  assume  that  the  statement  is  true  for  some  even m.  Then,  for any  qj  available 
at  odd  round m + 1, we  have  q ≤ qj  ≤ qm−1 .  Hence,  by Lemma  2,  any  qˆi  > qi
B  (qm) = 
m
qm+1  is  strictly  dominated  by  qm+1  and  eliminated.  Moreover,  every  qi  ∈  [qm , qm+1 ] =

B  (qm )
is  a  best  response  to  some  qj  with  qm  ≤  qj  ≤  qm−1 , and  it  is  not

Finally,  notice  that

CHAPTER 8.  RATIONALIZABILITY 

Therefore  the  intersections  of  the  above  intervals  is  {(1 − c) /3},  which  is  the  set  of 
rationalizable  strategies. 

Cournot  Oligopoly 

We  will  now  consider  the  case  of  three  or  more  ﬁrms.  When  there  are  three  or  more 
ﬁrms, rationalizability does not help, i.e., we cannot eliminate any strategy less than the 
monopoly  production  q1  = (1 − c) /2. 
In the ﬁrst round we eliminate any strategy qi  > (1 − c) /2, using the same argument 
in  the  case of duopoly.  But  in  the  second  round,  the maximum possible  total  supply by 
the  other  ﬁrms  is 

(n − 1) (1 − c) /2 ≥ 1 − c, 

where  n  is  the  number  of  ﬁrms.  The  best  response  to  this  aggregate  supply  level  is  0. 
Hence,  we  cannot  eliminate  any  strategy  in  round  2.  The  elimination  process  stops, 
yielding  [0, (1 − c) /2]  as  the  set  of  rationalizable  strategies. 
Of  course,  Cournot  oligopoly  has  a  unique  Nash  equilibrium  as  in  the  Cournot 
duopoly.  While  the  Nash  equilibrium  remains  to  make  strong  predictions  as  we  intro-
duce new ﬁrms,  the predictions of rationalizability become rather weak.  (In equilibrium 
analysis  the weak predictions of  rationalizability reappears as  instability of  equilibrium, 
making  equilibrium behavior highly  sensitive  to  the  speciﬁcation  of  beliefs.) 

8.3.2  Bertrand  Competition 

Consider two ﬁrms.  Simultaneously, each ﬁrm i sets a price pi . The ﬁrm i with the lower 
price  pi  < pj  sells  1 − pi  units  and  the  other  ﬁrm  cannot  sell  any.  If  the  ﬁrms  set  the 
same  price,  the  demand  is  divided  between  them  equally.  That  is,  the  amount  of  sales 
for  ﬁrm  i  is

We  assume  that  it  costs  noting  to  produce  the  good  (i.e.  c = 0).  Therefore,  the  proﬁt

•  Si  = [0, ∞) as  the  set  of  strategies  for  each  i, with  price  pi  a typical  strategy, 
•  π i  as  the  utility  function. 

Observe that when  pj  = 0,  π i (p1 , p2 ) = 0 for  every  pi ,  and  hence  every  pi  is  a  best 
response  to  pj  = 0.  This  has  two  important  implications: 

1.  Every strategy  is rationalizable (we cannot eliminate any strategy because each of 
them  is  a  best  reply  to  zero). 

1  = p∗ 
2.  p∗ 
2  = 0 is  a Nash  equilibrium. 

In  the  rest  of  the  notes,  we will  ﬁrst  show  that  this  is  indeed  the  only Nash  equilib-
rium.  In  other  words,  even  with  two  ﬁrms,  when  the  ﬁrms  compete  by  setting  prices, 
the competitive equilibrium will  emerge.  We will  then show that  if we modify the game 
slightly by discretizing the set of allowable prices and putting a minimum price, then the 
game becomes dominance-solvable,  i.e., only one strategy remains rationalizable.  In the 
modiﬁed game,  the minimum price  is  the only  rationalizable  strategy,  as  in competitive 
equilibrium.  Finally we will  introduce  small  search costs  on  the part of  consumers, who 
are not modeled as players, we will see the equilibrium behavior is dramatically diﬀerent 
from  the  equilibrium behavior  in  the  original  game  and  competitive  equilibrium. 

Nash  Equilibrium 

Theorem  11  The only Nash equilibrium is p∗  = (0, 0). 

92 

CHAPTER 8.  RATIONALIZABILITY 

Proof.  We  have  seen  that  p∗  = (0, 0)  is  a  Nash  equilibrium.  We  will  show  that  if 
(p1 , p2 ) is  a Nash  equilibrium,  then  p1  = p2  = 0.  To  do  this,  take  any Nash  equilibrium 
(p1 , p2 ). We  ﬁrst  show  that  p1  = p2 .  Towards  a  contradiction,  suppose  that  pi  > pj . If 
pj  = 0, then  π j  (pi , pj ) = 0, while  π j  (pi , pi) = (1 − pi) pi/2 >  0.  That  is,  choosing  pi  is 
a proﬁtable  deviation  for  ﬁrm  j , showing  that  pi  > pj  = 0 is  not  a  Nash  equilibrium. 
Therefore,  in  order  pi  > pj  to  be  an  equilibrium, we must  have  pj  > 0. But  then,  ﬁrm  i 
has a proﬁtable deviation:  π i (pi , pj ) = 0 while π i (pj , pij ) = (1 − pj ) pj /2 > 0.  All  in all, 
this shows that we cannot have pi  > pj  in equilibrium.  Therefore, we must have p1  = p2 . 
But  if  p1  = p2  in  a Nash  equilibrium,  then  it must be  that  p1  = p2  = 0.  This  is  because 
if  p1  = p2  > 0, then  ﬁrm 1 would  have  a  proﬁtable  deviation:  π1 (p1 , p2 ) = (1 − p1 ) p1/2 
while  π1 (p1  − ε, p2 ) = (1 − p1  + ε) (p1  − ε), which  is  close  to  (1 − p1 ) p1  when  ε  is  close 
to  zero. 

Rationalizability  with  discrete  prices 

Now  suppose  that  the  ﬁrms  have  to  set  prices  as multiples  of  pennies,  and  they  cannot 
charge  zero  price.  That  is,  the  set  of  allowable  prices  is 

P  = {0.01, 0.02, 0.03, . . .} . 
The  important  assumption  here  is  that  the minimum  allowable  price  pmin  = 0.01 yields 
a  positive  proﬁt.  We  will  now  see  that  the  game  is  "dominance-solvable"  under  this 
assumption.  In  particular  pmin  is  the  only  rationalizable  strategy,  and  it  is  the  only 
Nash  equilibrium  strategy.  Let  us  start with  the  ﬁrst  step. 
Step 1:  any price  p greater than the monopoly price  p
= 0.5 is strictly dominated 
mon
by  some  strategy  that  assigns  some  probability  (cid:18) >  0  to  the  price  pmin  = 0.01  and 
probability  1 − (cid:18)  to  the  price  p
= 0.5.

Thus,  π i  (σ (cid:18) , pj ) > 0.2499 ≥ π i  (pi , pj ) whenever  0 < (cid:18) ≤ 0.0004. Choose  (cid:18) = 0.0004. 
Now,  pick  any  pj  ≤ pmon . Since  pi  > pmon , we now have  π i (pi , pj ) = 0. But

Step  1  yields  the  eliminations  in  the  ﬁrst  round 1. 

Round  1  By  Step  1,  all  strategies  pi  with  pi  > p

each  pi  ≤  p

mon
of  remaining  strategies  is

Round  m  Suppose  that  the  set of  remaining  strategies  to  round m  is 

P m  = {0.01, 0.02, . . . , p¯} . 
Then,  the  strategy  p¯ is  strictly  dominated  by  a mixed  strictly  dominated by  the mixed 
strategy σ (cid:18)  with σ (cid:18)  ( ¯p − 0.01) = 1 − (cid:18) and σ (cid:18) ¡pmin ¢

then  eliminate  the  strategy  p¯.  There will  be no more  elimination because  each  pi  < p¯ is 
a  best  reply  to  pj  = pi  + 0.01. 
To  prove  that  p¯ is  strictly  dominated  by  σ (cid:18) ,  note  that  the  proﬁt from  p¯ for  player  i

Therefore,  the  process  continues  until  the  set  of  remaining  strategies  is  pmin  and 
it  stops  there.  Therefore,  pmin  is  the  only  rationalizable  strategy. 
Since players can put positive probability only on rationalizable strategies  in a Nash 
equilibrium,  the  only  possible  Nash  equilibrium  is  ¡pmin , pmin ¢ 
,  which  is  clearly  a  Nash 
equilibrium.
