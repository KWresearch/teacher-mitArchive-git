Rationalizable strategies 

The play is rationalizable, provided that … 

Formally, 
	 Game G = (N, S1,…,Sn; u1,…,un), where 
  N = set of players 
  Si  = set of all strategies of player i, 
  ui : S1 × … ×  Sn  →R is i's vNM utility function. 
  Belief = a probability distribution μ-i  on S-i 
  Mixed strategy = a probability distribution σi  on Si 
  Notation: ui(si,μ-i), ui(σi,s-i), etc. 
  si  is a best response to μ-i Ù ui(si,μ-i) ≥ ui(si’,μ-i)  ∀si’. 
  Bi(μ-i) = set of best responses to μ-i 
  σi  strictly dominates si Ù ui(σi,s-i) > ui(si,s-i) for all s-i. 
  si  is strictly dominated Ù some σi  strictly dominates si

Rationality & Dominance 
Theorem: si* is never a best reply to a belief μ-i Ù si* is 
strictly dominated. 
Proof: 
(=>) Assume si *∈Bi(μ-i). 
 
⇒ ∀si, ui(si*,μ-i) ≥ ui(si,μ-i) 
⇒  ∀σi, ui(si*,μ-i) ≥ ui(σi,μ-i) 
⇒  No σi strictly dominates si*. 
  Separating-Hyperplane Theorem: For any convex, non-empty and 
disjoint C and D with C closed, ∃r: ∀x∈cl(D) ∀y∈C, r⋅x ≥ r⋅y. 
  (<=) Assume si* is not strictly dominated. 
  Define 

C = {ui(σi,.)|σi  is a mixed strategy of i} 
D = {x |xk > ui(si*,s-i
k) ∀k}. 
  C and D are disjoint, convex and non-empty with C closed. 
  By SHT, ∃μ-i: ∀σi, ui(si*,μ-i) ≥ ui(σi,μ-i)

Foundations of rationalizability 

	 If the game and rationality are common knowledge, 
then each player plays a rationalizable strategy. 
	 Each rationalizable strategy profile is the outcome of 
a situation in which the game and rationality are 
common knowledge. 
	 In any “adaptive” learning model the ratio of players 
who play a non-rationalizable strategy goes to zero 
as the system evolves. 

Rationalizability in Cournot Duopoly 

Simultaneously, 
each firm i∈{1,2} 
produces qi  units at 
marginal cost c, 
and sells it at price 
P = max{0,1-q1 -q2}.

Rationalizability in Cournot duopoly 

  If i knows that qj ≤ q, then qi  ≥ (1-c-q)/2. 

  If i knows that qj ≥ q, then qi  ≤ (1-c-q)/2. 

  We know that qj ≥ q0 = 0.

  Then, qi  ≤ q1  = (1-c-q0)/2 = (1-c)/2 for each i;

  Then, qi  ≥ q2  = (1-c-q1)/2 = (1-c)(1-1/2)/2 for each i;

  …

  Then, qn  ≤ qi  ≤ qn+1  or qn+1  ≤ qi  ≤ qn  where  

qn+1 = (1-c-qn)/2 = (1-c)(1-1/2+1/4-…+(-1/2)n)/2. 
  As n→∞, qn → (1-c)/3.
