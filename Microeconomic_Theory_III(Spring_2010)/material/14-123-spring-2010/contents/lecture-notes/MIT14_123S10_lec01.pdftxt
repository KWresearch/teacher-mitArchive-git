Basic Concepts 

	 X = Set of Alternatives 
  Mutually exclusive 
  Exhaustive 
  A = non-empty set of available alternatives 
  Choice Function: c : A ↦ c(A) ⊆ A. 
  c(A) is non-empty 
  Preference: A relation ≽ on X that is 
  complete : ∀x,y∈X, either x≽y or y≽x; 
  transitive : ∀ x,y,z ∈ X, [x≽y and y≽z] ⇒x≽z. 
  Utility Function: U : X → R 

Choice Function 
A 

c 

c(A) 

  It describes what alternatives DM may choose under 
each set of constraints 
  Feasibility: c(A) ⊆ A. 
  Exhaustive: c(A) is non-empty 
  Mutually exclusive: only one alternative is chosen

Preference 

	 Preference Relation: A relation ≽ on X  s.t. 
  complete : ∀x,y∈X, either x≽y or y≽x; 
  transitive : ∀ x,y,z ∈ X, [x≽y and y≽z] ⇒x≽z. 
  x≽y means: DM finds x at least as good as y

  Preferences do not depend on A!

  Strict Preference: x ≻ y Ù [x≽y and not y≽x]

  Indifference:  x ~ y Ù  [x≽y and y≽x].

  Choice induced by preference: 

c≽(A) = {x ∈ A|x≽y  ∀y ∈ A} 

Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference 

Axiom (WARP): For all A,B ⊆ X and x,y ∈ A∩B, 
if x ∈ c(A) and y ∈ c(B), then x ∈ c(B). 
	 WARP: DM has well-defined preferences 
	 That govern the choice 
	 don’t depend on the set A of feasible alternatives

Choice v. Preference 

Definition: A choice function c is represented by 
≽  iff c = c≽. 
Theorem: Assume that X is finite. A choice 
function c is represented by some preference 
relation ≽  if and only if c satisfies WARP. 

Ordinal Utility Representation 

Ordinal Representation: U : X → R  is an ordinal 
representation of ≽  iff: 
x ≽ y Ù U(x) ≥ U(y)  ∀x,y∈X. 
Fact: If U represents ≽ and f: R→R  is strictly 
increasing, then f ◦ U represents ≽. 
Theorem: Assume X is finite (or countable). A relation 
has an ordinal representation if and only if it is 
complete and transitive. 
Example: Lexicographic preference relation on unit 
square does not have an ordinal representation.

Continuous Representation 

Definition: A preference relation ≽  is said to be 
continuous iff {y | y≽x} and {y | x≽y} are 
closed for every x in X. 
Theorem: Assume X is a compact, convex 
subset of a separable metric space. A 
preference relation has an ordinal 
representation if and only if it is continuous. 

Indifference Sets of a Continuous 
Preference 

x 

  I(x) = { y | x ~ y } 
  I(x) is closed. 
  If 
  x′≻x≻x′′ 
  φ:[0,1]→X continuous 
  φ(1)=x′; φ(0)=x′′, 
  Then, ∃ t ∈  [0,1] such 
that φ(t) ~ x.
