Decision Making  under  Risk 

In the previous lecture I considered abstract choice problems.  In this section, I will focus 
on a special class of choice problems and  impose more structure on the decision maker’s 
preferences.  I will  consider  situations  in which  the  decision maker  cares  only  about  the 
consequences, such as the amount of money in his bank account, but he may not be able 
to  choose  directly  from  the  set  of  consequences.  Instead,  he  chooses  from  alternatives 
that  determine  the  consequences  probabilistically,  such  as  a  lottery  ticket. 
In  this  lecture,  I  assume  that,  for  any  alternative  x,  the  probability  distribution  on 
the  set  of  consequences  induced  by  x  is  given.  That  is,  although  decision  maker  does 
not  know  the  consequence  of  choosing  a  given  alternative,  he  is  given  the  probability 
of  each  consequence  from  choosing  that  action.  This  is  called  decision  making  under 
risk.  Such  assumptions  can  be  plausible  in  relatively  few  situations,  such  as  chance 
games  in a  casino,  in which  there  are  ob jective probabilities.  In most  cases  of  economic 
interest,  the  alternatives  do  not  come with  probabilities.  The  decision maker  forms  his 
sub jective  beliefs  about  the  consequences  of  his  choices.  This  is  called  decision making 
under uncertainty.  I will analyze the decision making under risk as an intermediary step 
toward analyzing  decision making  under uncertainty. 

2.1  Consequences  and  Lotteries 

Consider  a  ﬁnite  set  C  of  consequences. A  lottery  is  a  probability  distribution  p  : 
P 
[0, 1]  on  C , where 
p(c) = 1.  The  set  of  all  lotteries  is  denoted  by  P . The

CHAPTER 2.  DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK 

consequences are embedded in P  as point masses on single lotteries.  For any c ∈ C , I will 
write c for both the consequence c and the probability distribution that puts probability 
1 on  c.  The  decision  maker  cares  about  the  consequence  that  will  be  realized,  but  he 
needs  to  choose  a  lottery.  In  the  language  of  the  the  previous  lecture,  the  set  X  of 
alternatives  is  P . 
A  lottery  can  be  depicted  by  a  tree.  For  example,  in  Figure  1,  Lottery  1  depicts 
a  situation  in  which  the  decision  maker  gets  $10  with  probability  1/2  (e.g.  if  a  coin 
toss  results  in  Head)  and  $0  with  probability  1/2  (e.g.  if  the  coin  toss  results  in  Tail). 
A  lottery  can  be  simple  as  in  the  ﬁgure,  assigning  a  probability  to  each  consequence, 
or  compound  as  in  Figure  2.3,  containing  successive  branches.  The  representation  of 
all  lotteries  as  probability  distributions  incorporates  the  assumptions  that  the  decision 
maker  is consequentialist, meaning  that he cares only about  the consequences, and that 
he  can  compute  the  probability  of  each  consequence under  compounding  lotteries.

Figure  2.1: 

Representing the  lotteries p as vectors, note that P  is a |C | − 1 dimensional simplex. 
Hence,  I  will  regard  P  as  a  subset  of  R|C |  (one  can  envision  it  as  a  subset  of  R|C |−1  as 
well).  Endowing R|C |  with  the  standard Euclidean metric,  note  that  P  is  a  convex  and 
compact  subset. 

2.2	 Expected  Utility  Maximization  –  Representa-
tion 

We would  like  to  have  a  theory  that  constructs  the  decision maker’s  preferences  on  the 
lotteries  from  his  preferences  on  the  lotteries.  There  are  many  of  them.  The  most 

2.3.  EXPECTED UTILITY MAXIMIZATION – CHARACTERIZATION 

11 

well-known–and the most canonical and the most useful–one is the theory of expected 
utility maximization by Von Neumann and Morgenstern.  In  this  lecture,  I will  focus on 
this  theory. 

Deﬁnition  5  A relation º on P  is said to be  represented by a von Neumann-Morgenstern 
utility  function  u : C  R  if  and  only  if 
→ 
X 
X
p º q  ⇐⇒  U (p) ≡ 
u(c)q(c) ≡ U (q) 
c∈C 
c∈C

u(c)p(c) ≥ 

(VNM) 

for  each  p, q ∈ P . 
This  statement  has  two  crucial  parts: 

1.	 U  :  P  → R  represents  º  in  the  ordinal  sense.  That  is,  if  U (p) ≥  U (q),  then  the 
decision maker ﬁnds  lottery p as good as  lottery q .  And conversely,  if  the decision 
maker  ﬁnds  p  at  least  as  good  as  q , then U (p) must  be  at  least  as  high  as U (q). 

2.  The  function  U  takes  a  particular  form:  for  each  lottery  p,  U (p)  is  the  expected 
P 
value  of  u  under  p. That  is,  U (p)  ≡ 
c∈C  u(c)p(c).  In  other  words,  the  decision 
maker  acts  as  if  he  wants  to  maximize  the  expected  value  of  u.  For  instance, 
the  expected  utility  of  Lottery  1  for  the  decision  maker  is  E (u(Lottery  1))  = 
2 u(10) +
 1 
1 
2 u(0).1 

2.3	 Expected  Utility  Maximization  –  Characteri-
zation 

The main ob jective of this lecture is to explore the conditions on preferences under which 
the  von-Neumann  Morgenstern  representation  in  (VNM)  is  possible.  In  this  way,  one 
may  have  a  better  insights  into what  is  involved  in  expected  utility maximization. 
First, as explained above, representation in (VNM) implies that U  represents º in the 
ordinal sense as well.  But, as we have seen in the previous lecture, ordinal representation 
implies  that º  is  a  preference  relation.  This  gives  the  ﬁrst  necessary  condition. 
Axiom  2  (Preference)  º  is  complete  and  transitive. 
R
1 If  C  were  a  continuum,  like  R,  we  would  compute  the  expected  utility  of  p  by  u(c)p(c)dc. 

12 

CHAPTER 2.  DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK 

Second,  in  (VNM),  U  is  a  linear  function  of  p,  and  hence  it  is  continuous.  That 
is,  (VNM)  involves  continuous  ordinal  representation.  Hence,  by  Theorem  3  of  the 
previous section, it is also necessary that º is continuous.  This gives the second necessary 
condition. 

Axiom  3  (Continuity)  º  is  continuous. 
Recall  from  the  previous  lecture  that  continuity  means  that  the  upper- and  lower-
contour  sets  {q |q º p}  and  {q |p º q}  are  closed  for  every  p  ∈  P .  In  this  special  setup, 
a  slightly  weaker  version  of  the  continuity  assumption  suﬃces:  for  any  p, q , r  ∈  P , the 
sets  {α ∈ [0, 1] |αp + (1 − p) q º r}  and  {α ∈ [0, 1] |r º αp + (1 − p) q}  are  closed.  Yet 
another  version  of  this  assumption  is  that  for  any  p, q , r  ∈ P , if  p Â  r, then  there  exist 
a, b ∈ (0, 1)  such  that  ap + (1 − a)r Â q Â bp + (1 − r)r. 
By  Theorem  3,  Axioms  2  and  3  are  necessary  and  suﬃcient  for  a  representation  by 
a continuous  function U .  The von Neumann and Morgenstern  representation  imposes a 
further  structure  on  U ,  requiring  that  it  is  in  fact  linear  in  probabilities.  This  linearity 
condition  corresponds  to  the  following  condition  on  the  preference,  which  is  called The 
Independence  Axiom. 

Axiom  4  (Independence)  For  any  p, q , r  ∈  P , and  any  a  ∈  (0, 1],  ap + (1 − a)r  º 
aq + (1 − a)r  ⇐⇒  p º q . 
That is, the decision maker’s preference between two lotteries p and q does not change 
if we toss a (possibly unfair) coin and give him a ﬁxed lottery r  if “tail” comes up.  Let p 
and  q  be  the  lotteries  depicted  in  Figure  2.2.  Then,  the  lotteries  ap + (1 − a)r  and 
aq + (1 − a)r  can  be  depicted  as  in  Figure  2.3,  where  we  toss  a  coin  between  a  ﬁxed 
lottery  r  and  our  lotteries  p  and  q .  Axiom  4  stipulates  that  the  decision  maker  would 
not  change  his  mind  after  the  coin  toss.  Therefore,  the  Independence  Axiom  can  be 
taken  as an axiom of  “dynamic  consistency.” 
The Independence Axiom imposes a structure on the indiﬀerence sets that is identical 
to  the  structure  of  the  isocurves  of  a  linear  function  U .  Together  with  the  continuous 
representation  theorem,  this  leads  to  an  expected  utility  representation.  In  the  sequel, 
I will  describe  the  structure  in detail  and prove  that  the  above  axioms  are  suﬃcient  for 
an  expected  utility  representation.  Towards  this  end,  the  following  exercise  lists  some

useful  implications  of  the  Independence  Axiom.  You  should  prove  the  listed  properties 
before  you  proceed. 

Exercise  1  For  any  preference  relation  º  that  satisﬁes  the  Independence  Axiom,  show 
that  the  fol lowing  are  true. 

1.  For  any  p, q , r, r 0  ∈ P  with  r ∼ r 0  and  any  a ∈ (0, 1], 
ap + (1 − a)r º aq + (1 − a)r 0  ⇐⇒  p º q . 

(2.1) 

2.  For any p, q , r ∈ P  and any real number a such that ap+ (1 − a) r, aq + (1− a)r ∈ P , 
if  p ∼ q , then  ap + (1 − a) r ∼ aq + (1 − a)r. 
(2.2) 

3.  For  any  p, q ∈ P  with  p Â q  and  any  a, b ∈ [0, 1]  with  a > b, 
ap + (1 − a) q Â bp + (1 − b) q . 

(2.3) 

4.  There  exists  cB , cW  ∈ C  such  that  for  any  p ∈ P , 
c B  º p º c W . 
[Hint:  use  completeness  and  transitivity  to  ﬁnd  cB , cW  ∈ C  with  cB  º  c º  cW  for 
al l  c ∈ C ;  then use  induction on  the number of consequences and  the  Independence 
Axiom.] 

(2.4) 

These  properties  can  be  spelled out  as  follows.  First,  recall  the  situation  considered 
by  the  Independence  Axiom:  we  toss  a  coin;  if  it  comes  head,  the  decision maker  faces 
p  or  q  depending  his  choice,  and  if  it  comes  tail,  he  faces  r. The  ﬁrst  property  states 
that  it does not matter whether he  faces  the same  lottery  in case of  tail or  two diﬀerent 
lotteries that he is indiﬀerent  to.  For  an  explanation  of  the  second  property  note  that 
in  the  situation  considered  by  the  Independence  Axiom,  according  to  the  axiom,  the 
decision  maker  would  be  indiﬀerent  between  the  two  compounding  lotteries  if  he  were 
indiﬀerent between p and q .  This corresponds to (2.2) for a ∈ [0, 1].  The property states 
more  generally  that  the  statement  remains  true  even  if  a  is  not  in  [0, 1],  in  which  case 
the  problem  couldn’t  be  represented  as  a  choice  between  two  compounding  lotteries. 

2.3.  EXPECTED UTILITY MAXIMIZATION – CHARACTERIZATION 

15 

The third property probability is a monotonicity probability.  It simply states that when 
a  decision  maker  faces  a  situation  in  which  he  can  end  up  a  better  lottery  p  or  worse 
lottery  q ,  then  he  would  prefer  higher  probabilities  of  p  to  lower  ones.  Finally,  the 
last  probability  states  that  there  are  best  and  worst  consequences  (by  transitivity  and 
completeness) and they are also best and worst  lotteries (by monotonicity).  Using these 
properties,  one  can  easily  prove  the main  result  in  this  lecture: 

Theorem  4  A relation  º  on  P  can  be  represented  by  a  von  Neumann-Morgenstern 
utility  function  u  :  C 
R  as  in  (VNM)  if  and  only  if  º  satisﬁes  Axioms  2,  3,  and  4. 
→ 
Moreover,  u  and  u˜ represent  the  same  preference  relation  if  and  only  if  u˜ =  au + b  for 
some  a > 0  and  b ∈ R. 
Proof.  Since we know already that representation in (VNM) implies Axioms 2, 3, and 4, 
I will  only prove  the  converse.  As  in  (2.4),  let  cB , cW  ∈ C  be  such  that  cB
W  for 
º p º c
every  p ∈ P . If  cB  ∼ cW ,  then  by  transitivity,  the  decision maker  is  indiﬀerent  between 
everything,  and  hence  u (c) ≡  0  for  all  c  satisﬁes  the  representation.  Assume  cB  Â  cW , 
and deﬁne  φ : [0, 1] → P  by φ (t) = tcW  + (1 − t) cB .  By  (2.3),  for  any  t, t0  ∈ [0, 1], 
(2.5) 
φ (t) º φ (t0)  ⇐⇒  t ≥ t.	
Then,  Lemma  1  of  the  previous  lecture  implies  that  for  every  p  ∈  P ,  there  exists  a 
unique U (p) ∈ [0, 1]  such  that 

p ∼ φ (U (p)) .	
First  observe  that U  indeed  represents º  in  the  ordinal  sense:  for  any  p, q ∈ P , 
p º q
φ (U (p)) º φ (U (q)) 
⇐⇒	
⇐⇒ 
U (p) ≥ U (q) .
[Here,  the  ﬁrst 
is  by  (2.5).]  In  order 
is  by  (2.2)  and  (2.6),  and  the  second 
⇐⇒ 
⇐⇒	
to  show that U  has  the  speciﬁc  structure  in  (VNM),  it  suﬃces  to  show  that U  is  linear. 
That  is,  for  any  a ∈ R  and  any  p, q ∈ P  with  ap + (1 − a) q ∈ P , 
U (ap + (1 − a) q) = aU (p) + (1 − a) U (q) .	
But,  since  p ∼ φ (U (p))  and  q ∼ φ (U (q)), 

(2.6) 

(2.7) 

ap + (1 − a) q	 ∼  aφ (U (p)) + (1 − a) φ (U (q)) 
=  φ (aU (p) + (1 − a) U (q)) , 

16 

CHAPTER 2.  DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK 

proving (2.7) by deﬁnition (2.6) of U . [Here, the indiﬀerence is by (2.1) and the equality 
is  by  deﬁnition  of  φ.] 
By the last statement in Theorem 4, the representation is “unique up to aﬃne trans-
formations”.  That  is,  a  decision  maker’s  preferences  do  not  change  when  we  change 
his von Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility  function by multiplying  it with a positive 
number,  or  adding  a  constant  to  it,  but  they  do  change  when  we  transform  it  through 
a  non-linear  transformation.  In  that  sense,  (VNM)  representation  is  “cardinal”.  Recall 
that,  in ordinal representation,  the preferences do not change even if the transformation 
is  non-linear,  so  long  as  it  is  increasing.  For  instance,  under  certainty,  v  =  √u  and 
u  represent  the  same  preference  relation,  while  (when  there  is  uncertainty)  the  VNM 
utility  function  v  =  √u  represents  a  very  diﬀerent  set  of  preferences  on  the  lotteries 
than  those  are  represented  by u. 

2.4  Indiﬀerence  Sets  under  Independence  Axiom 

In  the  sequel,  I  will  explore  the  structure  imposed  by  the  Independence  Axiom  on  the 
indiﬀerence  sets  in  more  detail,  explaining  the  logic  of  the  representation.  Recall  from 
the  previous  lecture  that  Axioms  2  and  3  imply  that  the  indiﬀerence  sets  are  closed. 
The  Independence Axiom has  two  further  implications  on  the  indiﬀerence  sets: 

1.  The  indiﬀerence  sets  on  the  lotteries  are  straight  lines  (i.e.  hyperplanes). 

2.  The  indiﬀerence  sets, which  are  straight  lines,  are  parallel  to  each  other. 

To  illustrate  these  facts,  consider  three  prizes  z0 , z1 , and  z2 , where  z2  Â  z1  Â  z0 . 
A lottery  p  can  be  depicted  on  a  plane  by  taking  p (z1 )  as  the  ﬁrst  coordinate  (on  the 
horizontal  axis),  and  p (z2 )  as  the  second  coordinate  (on  the  vertical  axis).  p (z0 )  is 
1 −  p (z1 ) −  p (z2 ). 
[See  Figure  2.4  for  the  illustration.]  Given  any  two  lotteries  p 
and  q ,  the  convex  combinations  ap + (1 − a) q  with  a  ∈  [0, 1]  form  the  line  segment 
connecting  p  to  q . Now,  taking  r  =  q ,  we  can  deduce  from  (2.2)  that,  if  p  ∼  q , then 
ap + (1 − a) q  ∼  aq  + (1 −  a)q  =  q  for  each  a  ∈  [0, 1].  That is,  the line segment 
connecting  p  to  q  is  an  indiﬀerence  curve.  Moreover,  if  the  lines  l  and  l0  are  parallel, 
then  α/β  =  |q 0 | / |q |, where  |q |  and  |q 0 |  are  the  distances  of  q  and  q 0  to  the  origin, 
respectively.  Hence,  taking  a  =  α/β ,  we  compute  that  p0  =  ap + (1 − a) z0  and  q 0  =

aq + (1 − a) z0 .  Therefore, by  (2.2),  if  l  is an  indiﬀerence  curve,  l 0  is also an  indiﬀerence 
curve,  showing  that  the  indiﬀerence  curves  are  parallel. 

These  two  properties  in  the  special  case  allows  one  to  construct  a  utility  function 
that  represents  the  preferences  in  the  sense  of  (VNM)  as  follows.  Line  l  can  be  deﬁned 
by  equation  u1p (z1 ) + u2p (z2) =  c  for  some  u1 , u2 , c  ∈  R. Since  l 0  is  parallel  to  l, 
then  l0  can  also  be  deﬁned  by  equation  u1p (z1 ) + u2p (z2 ) = c0  for  some  c0 . Since  the 
indiﬀerence  curves are deﬁned by equality u1p (z1 ) + u2p (z2 ) = c  for various values of  c, 
the  preferences  are  represented  by 

U (p) =  0 + u1p (z1 ) + u2p (z2 ) 
≡  u(z0 )p(z0 ) + u(z1 )p (z1 ) + u(z2 )p(z2 ), 

18 

where

u (z0 ) = 0, 

u(z1 ) =  u1 , 

u(z2 ) =  u2 , 

giving  the  desired  representation. 
I will now establish the above two facts, namely the indiﬀerence sets are hyperplanes 
and  parallel  to  each  other,  more  generally.  Using  these  facts,  I  will  describe  a  general 
way  to  construct  the  VNM  utility  function  u–similar  to  the  example  above.  I  will 
also  show  that  u˜ must  be  an  aﬃne  transformation  of  u,  in  order  to  represent  the  same 
preference relation.  Those who are not  interested may skip  it and  follow the subsequent 
lectures. 
I will  ﬁrst  show  that  the  indiﬀerence  set  I (p) is  a  hyperplane.  That  is, 

I (p) = (p + V  (p)) ∩ P 
for some linear subspace  V  (p) of R|C | . Note  that  V  (p) is  a  linear  subspace means  that 
ax + by ∈ V  (p) for any x, y ∈ V  (p) and any  real numbers a  and b.  For  simplicity,  I will 
assume  that  p  is  in  the  relative  interior  of  p. 

Proposition  1  Under  Axioms  2  and  4,  for  every  p  in  the  relative  interior  of  P , the 
indiﬀerence  set  I (p) is  a  hyperplane. 

Proof.  Deﬁne 

V  (p) = {a (q − p) |q ∈ I (p) , a ∈ R} . 
To  show  that  V  (p) is  a  linear  subspace,  take  any  x = a (q − p) , y = b (r − p) ∈ V  (p), 
where  a  and  b  are  real  numbers  and  q  ∼  p  ∼  r .  For  arbitrary  α, β  ∈  R, I  show  that 
z  = αx + β y  ∈  V  (p). Now,  since  q , r  ∈  P  and  p  is  in  the  relative  interior  of  P , there 
such that s = λαaq + λβ br + (1 − λαa − λβ b) p ∈ P . Since z = λ−1 (s − p), 
exists λ = 0
it  suﬃces  to  show  that  s ∈ I (p).  Indeed, 
s  =  λαaq + λβ br + (1 − λαa − λβ b) p 
∼  λαap + λβ br + (1 − λαa − λβ b) p = λβ br + (1 − λβ b) p 
∼  λβ bp + (1 − λβ b) p = p,

where  both  indiﬀerences  are  by  (2.2). 
To show that (p + V  (p)) ∩ P  = I (p), it suﬃces to show that for any a (q − p) ∈ V  (p) 
with  a (q − p) + p  ∈  P ,  a (q − p) + p  ∼  p. But  since  q  ∈  I (p)  and  a (q − p) + p  = 
aq + (1 − a) p, this is true by (2.2). 
Moreover,  the  hyperplanes  I (p) and  I (q) are  parallel: 

Proposition  2  For  any  p  and  q  in  the  interior  of  P ,  the  indiﬀerence  sets  I (p)  and 
I (q) are  paral lel  hyperplanes.  That  is,  I (p) = (p + V ) ∩ P  and  I (q) = (q + V ) ∩ P  for 
some  linear  subspace  V . 

Proof.  It  suﬃces  to  show  that  V  (p) = V  (q) in  the  previous  proposition  and  its  proof. 
That is, for any a (p0  − p) with p0  ∈ I (p) and a ∈ R, there exist b ∈ R and q 0  ∈ I (q) such 
that  a (p0  − p) = b (q 0  − q).  The  last  equality  can  be  written  as  q 0  = q + (a/b) (p0  − p). 
Since  q  is  in  the  interior  and  p, p0  ∈ P , there  exists  b  such  that  q 0  ∈ P  and  a/b < 0. Let 
−a/b 
r  =  1−a/b p + 1−a/b q  ∈  P .  Then,  q  =  a/bp + (1 − a/b) r  and  q 0  =  a/bp0  + (1 − a/b) r . 
1
Since  p ∼ p0 ,  this implies by (2.2)  that  q ∼ q 0 . 
Now,  excluding  the  trivial  case  of  cB  ∼  cW ,  assume  that  cB  Â  cW .  Then,  for  any 
interior  p,  we must have  cB  Â p Â cW .  In  that  case,  together with  the  last  proposition, 
Lemma  1  of  the  previous  lecture  implies  that  the  dimension  of  dim V  ≥  dim P  − 1. 
For  otherwise,  one  could  connect  cB  to  cW  without  intersecting  I (p).  Moreover,  since 
cB  Â  cW ,  I (p) =6 P .  Hence,  dim V  = dim P  − 1 = |C | − 2.  In  that  case,  there  exists 
u ∈ RC \ {0}  such  that

probability vectors p and q . Let U (V ) be the set of u ∈ RC \ {0} that satisfy (2.8).  Since 
dim V  = dim P  − 1,  U (V ) is  one-dimensional:  if  u, u0  ∈  U (V ), then  u0  = au  for  some 
a ∈ R. By  deﬁnition  of  V , 

(2.8) 

p ∼ q  ⇐⇒  u · (p − q) = 0. 
Hence, U (V ) is the set of utility functions that result in the indiﬀerence sets ∼. To make 
sure  that  the  indiﬀerence  sets  are  ranked  correctly,  one  also  imposes  ucB  > ucW  . This 
is  another  way  to  construct  the  set  of  von-Neumann  and Morgenstern  utility  functions 
and prove  that  the  representation  is  unique  only  up  to  aﬃne  transformations.
