Problem  Set  1 

The  due  date  for  this  assignment  is  Thursday  February  11. 

1.  Let P  be  the  set  of  all  lotteries  p = (px , py , pz ) on  a  set C  = {x, y , z}  of  consequences. 
Below,  you  are  given  pairs  of  indiﬀerence  sets  on  P .  For  each  pair,  check  whether 
the  indiﬀerence  sets  belong  to  a  preference  relation  that  has  a  Von-Neumann  and 
Morgenstern  representation  (i.e.  expected  utility  representation).  If  the  answer  is 
Yes,  provide  a Von-Neumann  and Morgenstern  utility  function;  otherwise  show which 
Von-Neumann  and Morgenstern  axiom  is  violated.  (In  the  ﬁgures  below,  setting  pz  = 
1 − px  − py , we  describe P  as  a  subset  of R2 .) 
(a)  I1  = {p|1/2 ≤ py  ≤ 3/4}  and  I2  = {p|py  = 1/4}:

2.  For  any  preference  relation  º  that  satisﬁes  the  Independence  Axiom,  show  that  the 
following  are  true. 

(a)  For  any  p, q , r, r 0  ∈ P  with  r ∼ r 0  and  any  a ∈ (0, 1], 
ap + (1 − a)r º aq + (1 − a)r 0  ⇐⇒  p º q . 
(b)  For any p, q , r ∈ P  and any real number a such that ap+(1 − a) r, aq+(1− a)r ∈ P , 
(2) 
if  p ∼ q , then  ap + (1 − a) r ∼ aq + (1 − a)r. 
(c)  For  any  p, q ∈ P  with  p Â q  and  any  a, b ∈ [0, 1]  with  a > b, 
ap + (1 − a) q Â bp + (1 − b) q .

(d)  There  exist  cB , cW  ∈ C  such  that  for  any  p ∈ P , 
c B  º p º c W .	
[Hint:  use completeness and  transitivity  to ﬁnd cB , cW  ∈ C  with cB
W  for 
º c º c
all c ∈ C ; then use induction on the number of consequences and the Independence 
Axiom.]

3.  Let	 P  be  the  set  of  probability  distributions  on  C  =  {x, y , z}.  Find  a  continuous 
preference  relation º  on P ,  such  that  the  indiﬀerence  sets are all  straight  lines, but º 
does  not  have  a  von Neumann-Morgenstern  utility  representation. 
4.  Let º˙ be the "at  least as  likely as" relation deﬁned between events  in Lecture 3.  Show 
that º˙
is  a  qualitative  probability.
