1.  Lecture Notes; Chapter  6.4, Exercise  8. 

2.  Alice and Bob seek each other.  Simultaneously, Alice puts eﬀort sA  and Bob puts eﬀort 
sB  to  search.  The  probability  of  meeting  is  sAsB ;  the  value  of  the  meeting  is  vA  ≥  0 
for Alice  and  vB  ≥ 0  for Bob,  and  the  search  costs  s3  to Alice  and  s3  to Bob.

(a)  Compute  the  set  of  all  rationalizable  strategies. 
(b)  How do  the  rationalizable  search  eﬀorts  change with  vA  and  vB ? 

3.  Consider a game with a ﬁnite set N  = {1, . . . , n} of players and a ﬁnite set S  = S1×· · ·× 
Sn  of strategy proﬁles.  A general information structure is a list (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p1 , . . . , pn) 
where Ii  is the information partition of i and pi  ∈ ∆ (Ω) is the prior belief of i for every 
i  ∈  N .  For  every  rationalizable  strategy  si ∗  ∈  Si∞  of  every  player  i,  show  that  there 
exist a general information structure (Ω, I1 , . . . , In , p1 , . . . , pn) and an adapted strategy 
proﬁle  (s1 , . . . , sn)  such  that 

•  si  (ω∗ ) = s∗  for  some  ω∗  ∈ Ω  and 
i 
•  sj  (ω) ∈ arg maxsj ∈Sj  Epj  [uj  (sj , s−j ) |Ij  (ω)]  for  every ω ∈ Ω  and  j  ∈ N .
