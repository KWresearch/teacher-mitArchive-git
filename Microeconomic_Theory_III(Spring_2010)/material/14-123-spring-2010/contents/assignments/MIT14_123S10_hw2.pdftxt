Problem  Set  2 

The due date  for  this  assignment  is Thursday February  25  (You  can  return  it  on 
Tuesday March  1  without  penalty.) 

1.  There  are  two  urns,  A  and  B ,  each  consisting  of  100  balls,  some  are  black  and  some 
are  red.  In  urn  A  there  are  30  red  balls,  but  the  number  of  red  balls  in  urn  B  is  not 
known.  We  draw  a  ball  from  urn  A  with  color  α  and  a  ball  from  urn B  with  color  β . 
Consider  the  following  acts:

Let  c  be  the  choice  function  induced by º. Find  the  sets  c ({fA,r , fA,b , fB ,r , fB ,b})  that 
are  consistent with  110 Â 100 Â 0  and  Savage’s  postulates. 
2.  Exercise  6.C.19  in Mass-Colell, Whinston,  and  Green  (Assume  that  the  asset  returns 
are  independent.)

3.  Exercise  6.D.3  in Mass-Colell, Whinston,  and Green 
4.  Consider a monopolist who faces a stochastic demand.  If he produces q units, he incurs 
θ, θ¤ 
a zero marginal cost and sells the good at price P  (θ, q) where θ ∈ £ 
¯
is an unknown 
demand  shock  where  P  and  C  twice  diﬀerentiable.  Assume  that  the  proﬁt  function 
is  strictly  concave  in  q  for  each  given  θ, and  P  (θ, q) + qPq  (θ, q)  is  increasing  in  θ, 
where  Pq  is  the  derivative  of  P  with  respect  to  q .  The  monopolist  is  expected  proﬁt 
maximizer. 

(a)  Show  that  there  exists  a  unique  optimal  production  level  q∗ . 
(b)  Show  that  if  the  distribution  of  θ  changes  from  G  to  F  where  F  ﬁrst-order  sto-
chastically  dominates G,  then  the  optimal  production  level  q∗  weakly  increases. 
(c)  Take  P  (θ, q) =  φ (θ) − γ (q).  Suppose  that  there  are  two  identical  monopolists 
as  above  in  two  independent  but  identical markets.  Find  conditions  under which 
the  monopolists  have  a  strict  incentive  to  merge  and  share  the  proﬁt from  each 
market  equally.
