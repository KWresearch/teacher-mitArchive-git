***** Description *****
This course provides an exciting, eye-opening, and thoroughly useful inquiry
into what it takes to live an extraordinary life, on your own terms. The
instructors address what it takes to succeed, to be proud of your life, and to
be happy in it. Participants tackle career satisfaction, money, body, vices,
and relationship to themselves and others. They learn how to address issues in
their lives, how to live life, and how to learn from it.
This course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is
a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
end of the month. This not-for-credit course is sponsored by the Department of
Science, Technology, and Society. A similar, semester-long version of this
course is taught in the Sloan Fellows Program. A semester-long extension of the
IAP course is also taught to the population at large of MIT.
