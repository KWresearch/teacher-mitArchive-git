Assignment 2 

1.	 Go back into all the work you did on Assignment 1 ‘explaining’ the ratings of 
your life and now find all the lies (i.e. the justifications).  Distinguish them 
clearly.  If you do this work within the writing you did for Assignment 1, have 
the new assignment be distinguishable (in bold, or underlined, etc.) 

2.	 The foundation of a person’s evolution starts at the point where you actually 
are, by telling the truth about yourself.  The greatest thing that moves life is 
talking about the truth.  How can you love yourself, your life and what you’re 
designing if you’re not allowed to be yourself?  You’ve got to be willing to 
talk and open up and have the whole truth be okay. 

The Confession: Write up a list of everything that you are embarrassed about, 
ashamed of, haunted by, your secrets, all the things you hide or don’t want 
people to know, even the small ones you manage, anyone you hurt, all the lies 
and everything else you manage to keep hidden.
