Assignment 3 

1.	 Confessing yourself 
a.	 Confess something you’re hiding on purpose to at least 1 person.  Write up 
and email what you shared, to whom, and how it went. 
b.	 Make a list of who else ought to get confessions from you.  For each one, 
say by when you will have that conversation.   
i.	 This is your 1st opportunity to deal with your personal integrity as a 
matter of your own word.  It won’t feel good to put them on the list 
and then not do them. 
ii.	 Tip: Don’t suffer over them by putting dates like – ‘in 2 years’. 
Include whatever you’re hiding from people (if it’s that someone 
iii.	
hurt your feelings and you haven’t told them, etc.) 
If there’s a confession you’re not going to tell someone – write what that 
is and why. 
i.	 We’re not out to force anything – this is to teach you important and 
useful information 
ii.	 The big ones you feel like you’re going to get in a lot of trouble for 
belong here. 

c.	

2.	 Action Plan - Based on the work you did on the ratings of the areas of your life in 
Assignments 1 and 2, now create an action plan for this year that inspires you.  It 
should not be impossible, but something you can do for this year to move the 
ratings in each area to a higher number.  The action plan should be something that 
inspires you. 
a.	 Create specific actions for each area to move the ratings in that area to a 
higher number. 
1.	 Be specific – e.g. ‘run 3 times per week for 30 minutes’ vs. ‘start 
to work out’. 
b.	 Make up new ‘Laws’ in each area. 
1.	 E.g. When I notice I am mumbling to myself about someone, I 
will communicate it to them within 24 hours. 

3.  Anything else you want to ask.
