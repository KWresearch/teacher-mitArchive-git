Overall, this was a very strong debate. Each side offered 
potent arguments in favor of their perspective, and there 
was a genuine clash between the opposing teams. The 
speeches were generally compelling, with considerable 
substance offered in well-organized and understandable 
packaging. Most impressive to me was the detail that each 
team mustered in support of its claims, with plenty of 
historical and current case studies to present as well as 
sophisticated philosophical background. I was surprised and 
delighted to find that you are so expert in history and 
politics. You’ve earned much respect from me. 
 
I can offer only one general critique of content in this 
debate, and I offer it with some hesitation, as it may 
reflect my own biases rather than a legitimate complaint 
about the content of the debate. When I wrote this 
resolution, I imagined it as, among other things, an 
examination of the value of heterogeneity. While the 
affirmative team touched on this issue occasionally, it did 
not serve as the central focus of their argument, and they 
instead defended the idea of cultural and political 
sovereignty as a general principle. My sense of the 
resolution was most proximal in Alex’s question during the 
audience question period, when he challenged the negative 
team regarding the notion of “local maxima.” The essence of 
his question was to point out that a given point of 
stability (in this case, the general but eventually 
universal spread of democracy) is not necessarily an 
overall optimum, since it may represent only a “local” 
optimum, better than situations that differ from it 
slightly but possibly worse than situations that differ 
dramatically. But with no significant diversity, we will 
never get a chance to explore dramatically different 
political and social structures, and so will never know 
whether they might in fact be preferable (since the local 
maximum tends to restore its stability when it perturbed 
only mildly). Some concern such as this is one reason that 
I intuitively appreciate the affirmative position in this 
debate: I value diversity, even (especially?) radical 
diversity, since it keeps open possibilities for radical 
improvement, even if it risks significant harm at the same 
time. As neither team took up this point centrally (the 
negative team had no real response to Alex’s question), I 
felt as though the debate was slightly off target, at least 
if the resolution is taken to be the target. 
 

That is, while I quite liked the grounded and concrete 
sense given to the terms of the debate, I wondered whether 
argument about these particular cases (Iraq, Serbia, 
Somalia, the Cold War, WWII, etc.) necessarily led to 
conclusions about the resolution as a whole. It is 
certainly possible, and maybe even likely, that we could 
find a particular justification for invading Iraq for 
instance, while still supporting the notion of radical 
diversity as a general principle (and a general policy, 
which gets violated in certain circumstances). It is also 
possible, and maybe even likely, that we could agree that 
sovereign nations and diverse cultures should be tolerated 
even at our peril, without believing that it is important 
to do so in order to preserve or value heterogeneity. That 
is, the negative team might have argued that the invasion 
of Iraq was a bad idea but that tolerating heterogeneity 
has nothing to do with why it was a bad idea. I am 
suggesting that there was a sort of missing link in the 
debate between the concrete examples under discussion and 
their relation to the overall resolution. The debaters 
seemed to get caught up in the examples, and so miss to 
some extent the question of their relationship to the 
resolution. 
 
Lastly, in terms of the organization and presentation of 
the speeches, these were strong showings, with clear and 
forceful ideas articulately offered. As always, though, 
there could have been still more “architecture” in these 
speeches. A couple of the speakers remembered to have an 
introduction and conclusion to their speeches, but some did 
not. Furthermore, most of these speeches still came across 
as a list of ideas or arguments. Instead of just a list, it 
is very helpful to relate each argument back to the main 
point, spelling out the details of this relationship to 
your audience. Moreover, some sort of organizing principle 
helps not only to clarify your points but to make them more 
memorable: a list of three categories for your arguments, 
or a repeated refrain that marks the start of a new 
argument, or even a consistent and clearly stated numbering 
system. Listeners need help keeping track of spoken 
presentations; by telling us your plan and then executing 
it and then reminding us of what you did, you reinforce and 
strengthen your points. 
 
Still, I was very impressed with this debate overall, and I 
learned from it. There was much subtlety and there was a 

willingness on both sides to take the ideas seriously. 
Great job. 

Joy, 
 
Your opening presentation was wonderfully clear and well 
paced, with a solid statement of the affirmative position 
and truly substantive arguments packed into a short space. 
You seem to have a gift for public speaking, as you 
naturally organize your words with a certain rhetorical 
flourish. You don’t show any signs of being flustered or 
nervous, using a conversational tone and a comfortable pace 
to get your points across. The only real criticism of this 
speech that I can offer is the general one: a little more 
architecture would help. This opening speech was an 
opportunity to prepare something flashier, and while this 
was certainly coherent and articulate, it still felt too 
often like a list of arguments. Was there an overriding 
approach or theme that could have intervened at key moments 
in your five minutes? Could you have developed more fully 
the links between the individual points and the primary 
claim that founded the affirmative platform? 
 
Linda’s cross-examination following this speech was a great 
way to open the clash between the two teams. Her questions 
were very aggressive, but she did not sacrifice any 
substance for the sake of her imposing style. Your answers 
were well constructed, as they maintained a sense of poise 
and confidence that they may not have earned. What I mean 
is that your answers were sometimes evasive or shallow, but 
your tone never gave away this weakness, and so any 
observer would have thought that you were matching Linda’s 
strong questions with equally strong answers. Good job. 
 
Your “return” cross-examination was also a strong clash and 
a good moment in the debate. My sense was that Linda’s 
resolute attitude eventually felt somewhat unassailable, 
and you came across as slightly defensive when your roles 
would dictate that you should be on offense. Still, there 
was real substance in this examination, and you advanced 
the terms of the debate. 
 
Your closing, rebuttal speech was another highlight, as you 
rose above the fray with rhetorical questions and a calm, 
confident presentation. To some extent, you backed off from 
the most intense clash with the negative team in this 
speech, instead restating the affirmative position and 
summing up the key points you felt that the affirmative 
team had won. To me, this was a good strategy, as the 
debate had gotten caught up in a lot of details and you 

were offering some overview, putting it all in perspective 
for your listeners. A couple of your points had not been 
covered much since the opening speech, and they felt 
slightly off track. Nevertheless, you left your audience 
with a strong sense of reasons to favor your affirmative 
position. Well done.

Linda, 
 
Your opening negative speech offered strong and 
sophisticated arguments at many levels, making subtle 
distinctions that could prove decisive in a complex topic 
like this one. Your aggressive tone never becomes 
altogether hostile, and listeners are forced to take you 
and your ideas seriously even if we become slightly 
uncomfortable being talked at so insistently. Your pace was 
probably a bit too quick; I know that you had a lot of 
arguments to work in, but you are probably better off 
slowing down for maximum clarity and effect rather than 
making sure to make every possible argument. In fact, some 
of your points were surely lost on pretty much everyone in 
the room. Have any of your peers read Rawls’ A Theory of 
Justice? I know what the veil of ignorance is, but a 
sophisticated argument like this must be carefully 
explained if it is to have a broad appeal. You’d be lucky 
to make this point clear even if you spent fully five 
minutes on it, so it’s kind of hopeless in thirty seconds. 
This is too bad, since it is a strong point and worth 
consideration in a debate on this topic. (Note that Rawls 
claims that his arguments do not necessarily lead to 
democracy or capitalism; rather they support a relatively 
balanced distribution of wealth. If we take his argument 
seriously, then your claim would lead to the conclusion 
that the United States should give away most of its assets 
in an attempt to balance wealth distribution around the 
world. That would be a tough sell!) 
 
As with everyone else, I urge you to try to inject a bit 
more structure into your speeches. Connecting your 
individual points to your main point would make everything 
more clear and more forceful. A few (not most) of your 
arguments felt like debating tricks rather than sincere and 
thoughtful points. Though it was discussed at some length, 
it was never clear to me how your “survival of the fittest” 
argument was different from a “might makes right” claim, 
and if it wasn’t different, then this hardly seems like an 
argument you could offer in good conscience. 
 
Your cross examinations were great strengths in this 
debate. Joy managed to respond to your initial salvo of 
aggressive questions well, even though her answers were not 
as substantive as your questions. When she cross-examined 
you, you actually put her on the defensive by refusing to 
give any ground. You come across as straightforward and 

self-confident, which is disarming to your interlocutor. 
Well done. 
 
Your closing speech was quite effective, I thought. Your 
subpoints were more clearly related to your overall claim, 
and there was more of a sense of organization of ideas, 
provided in part by the prior context of the debate. I wish 
we had had time to discuss your policeman analogy, as I am 
pretty suspicious about it, but it was a good argument in 
any case, capturing a complex ethical issue in a familiar 
context that everyone can immediately understand.

Jiji, 
 
Your second affirmative speech laid out a subtle and 
compelling reason to favor the affirmative team. Your 
presentation was organized, although this organization was 
not always clear enough to the audience. For instance, you 
started off with four points, and while I heard four of 
them go by, it was not immediately clear where one point 
ended and the next began. Just saying a number out loud 
would have helped to distinguish these points and make them 
memorable. They were also a bit quick. Perhaps giving each 
one a short name or title would provide a “hook” for 
listeners to hang your argument on. 
 
The bulk of your speech was a second set of three points. 
These were more clearly distinguished from each other by 
the repeated phrase, “If we define ‘desirable’ as…,” and 
this was a really interesting way of constructing an 
argument. By showing that no matter where you place your 
value, you must still conclude that heterogeneity is the 
best way to get there, you offer a seemingly airtight case 
in favor of the affirmative position. Furthermore, this 
argument has a built-in structure or architecture, which 
helps to make it memorable. Probably, you could have used 
this architecture more effectively though. Had you spelled 
out your strategy, it all would have come more clearly into 
focus. By explaining you plan at the outset of the argument 
and then summarizing it again after the details, the 
argument would have stuck more and would have carried more 
force. As it was, it was hard to sort out the real force 
from the details. 
 
Lastly, much of this speech was read off the page, and this 
limited your ability to make eye contact. The most 
compelling debate presentations are also the most genuine, 
so I think you would have been better served to look 
directly at the audience and speak as if from the heart. 
 
Your cross-examinations were very enjoyable. When Asiri 
questioned you, he kept hammering away at his basic 
question, and you had consistent responses to this line of 
questioning. It seemed as though he had trouble developing 
further questions, which allowed you to stick to your 
position and made you appear confident and knowledgeable. 
During your cross-examination of Asiri, the dynamic was 
very engaging, as each side kept knocking the other onto 
the defensive. Asiri turned the questioning around by 

asking you about Tibet, but your response was a stroke of 
genius when you used the negative’s argument against them. 
Asiri couldn’t really come back from this attack, though he 
did successfully shift focus and regain his footing by 
ignoring Tibet again. His closing moment in these questions 
was a point for the negative, as he bluntly admitted that 
his policy does not so much favor the US as it does the 
strongest system no matter who that might be. Fun question 
rounds!

Asiri, 
 
Your second negative speech hammered home some of the key 
points in the negative debate. Your pace was excellent and 
your tone was very clear, with only occasional fading out 
around the edges of your sentences. It was very wise to 
begin with a restatement of the negative position overall, 
and it was too bad that you didn’t end that way as well. In 
general, this speech was subject to the same criticisms 
that I offered the others: it would have benefited from a 
bit more structure. That is, you could have returned even 
more frequently to your central claim, relating your 
individual points back to that claim and organizing them 
using some sort of principle or repeated phrase. But the 
arguments themselves were well presented and compelling. 
 
Your rounds of cross-examination were very entertaining. 
You started off asking Jiji about a central idea, and you 
kept coming back to this idea. While she never really gave 
up much territory, I liked the strategy of reasking the 
same question, as it forced her to come up with new ways of 
expressing herself, and might have led to some interesting 
opening that the negative team could have exploited. When 
Jiji cross-examined you, there was a great back-and-forth, 
as each side kept gaining and then losing the advantage. 
Her response to your question about Tibet was brilliant, 
but you minimized the damage by quickly shifting focus back 
to China-US relations, moving away from Tibet. You ended 
this question period on a really strong note, answering a 
blunt “Yes,” to Jiji’s question about whether the US should 
be attacked by a stronger nation. This provocative answer 
was part of the negative strategy of sticking to principle 
rather than appealing to nationalistic sentiment, and it’s 
a strategy that play well, at least when I’m the audience. 
Nice job.
