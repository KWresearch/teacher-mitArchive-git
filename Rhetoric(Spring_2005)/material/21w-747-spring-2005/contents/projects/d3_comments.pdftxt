Overall,  a  strong  debate,  with  both  teams  offering  much 
substance,  and  a  genuine  sense  of  a  clash  between  the  two 
teams.  The  speeches  were  on  the  whole  markedly  better  than 
in  past  debates.  Most  impressive  to  me  was  the  ability  of 
each  speaker  to  offer  detailed  and  particular  arguments 
without  getting  lost  in  those  details.  While  there  could 
still  have  been  more  architecture  and  rhetorical 
deliberateness  in  the  speeches,  they  were  thoughtfully 
organized,  and  most  had  at  least  an  introduction  and 
conclusion  to  orient  the  audience’s  perspective.  Pace  was 
excellent  throughout  and  each  speaker  invested  her  words 
with  a  sense  of  candor  and  import;  that  is,  speakers 
(usually)  appeared  to  be  thinking  while  speaking,  not  just 
saying the words but meaning them at the same time. 
 
As  usual,  I  am  hard  pressed  to  choose  a  victor  in  the 
debate. This is not just diplomacy on my part. Rather, each 
side  had  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  their  arguments,  and  I 
was not convinced that one or the other side had ultimately 
gotten  the  upper  hand.  The  affirmative  team  presented  the 
only  viable  definition  in  the  round,  and  used  it 
(implicitly)  to  good  effect,  including  things  such  as  stem 
cell  research  and  “cross  breeding”  under  the  definition  of 
genetic  engineering.  The  negative  team  challenged  a  number 
of  these  particular  examples,  but  lacking  a  consistent 
alternate  definition,  could  not  make  it  clear  just  what 
cases  should  fall  under  genetic  engineering  in  general. 
While  the  affirmative  team  did  not  convince  me  that  all  of 
these  things  ought  to  count  as  genetic  engineering,  their 
definitional  dominance  was  nevertheless  a  point  in  their 
favor. 
 
However,  the  affirmative  strategy  overall  was  not  as 
aggressive  or  compelling  as  it  might  have  been.  Their 
primary  argument,  as  far  as  I  could  tell,  was  to  trot  out 
long  lists  of  things  that  genetic  engineering  has  done  or 
might  do  and  say  that  these  are  good  things.  There  were  a 
few nods toward moral questions (“If we can help people, we 
are obliged to do so,”) but the bulk of the argument was to 
show that lots of good may come of GE. The affirmative team 
does  provide  some  specific  responses  to  negative  arguments, 
and  some  of  these  responses  were  good  ones,  but  even  the 
responses  too  often  fell  back  on  an  extension  of  the  list 
of good things that GE might provide. 
 
The  affirmative  team  did  seem  prepared  to  take  on  the 
question  of  risk,  and  the  analysis  of  risk  might  have 

become  a  key  element  in  this  debate  had  one  side  or  the 
other  been  prepared  to  offer  a  more  detailed  argument.  So 
while  risk  was  something  of  a  wash,  the  issue  that 
affirmative  most  tellingly  failed  to  address  adequately  was 
that  of  societal  imbalance.  Perhaps  Samantha’s  extended 
discussion  of  cloning  was  intended  to  address  this  negative 
challenge,  but  I  must  admit  that  I  wasn’t  entirely  sure 
what  this  cloning  thing  was  about.  The  affirmative  team  did 
point  out  that  some  aspects  of  GE  technologies  are  likely 
to  help  the  underprivileged  most  of  all,  and  this  was  a 
good  point,  but  still  didn’t  quite  take  the  bull  by  the 
horns.  The  argument,  as  presented  by  the  negative  team,  is 
that  if  GE  lets  people  choose  their  children’s 
characteristics,  this  will  widen  the  gap  between  wealthy 
and poor, since the wealthy will have more access to better 
child-choosing  technologies,  so  that  their  children  will  be 
smarter,  better  looking,  and  better  able  to  dominate  poor 
people.  Though  possibly  too  science-fictional  for  us  to 
appreciate  its  full  impact,  this  to  me  is  a  deep  concern 
and a likely outcome of the vigorous pursuit of GE.  Gattaca 
feels all too real. 
 
The  negative  certainly  pushed  this  economic  argument,  but 
also  muddled  it  by  surrounding  it  with  inflated  worries 
about  a  world  full  of  superhumans  and  the  bizarre  question 
of  fetal  consent.  (This  issue  of  consent  is  not  irrelevant, 
but  it’s  a  tough  argument  to  get  off  the  ground.  As  the 
affirmative  pointed  out,  fetuses  never  get  to  consent  to 
anything  about  themselves.  Of  course,  we  do  have  standards 
of  consent  for  human  research  subjects,  but  they  probably 
don’t  apply  in  this  case.  Legal  precedents  allow  for 
interventions  in  utero,  without  the  fetus’s  consent,  up  to 
and  including  abortion!)  The  negative’s  strength  in  this 
debate  was  its  willingness  to  push  hard  on  the  subtleties 
of  the  term  “vigorously.”  By  choosing  to  go  after  this  one 
word,  the  negative  shifted  the  nature  of  the  debate  and 
possibly  caught  the  affirmative  team  off  guard.  For  the 
negative  team,  arguing  against  the  “vigorous  pursuit”  of  GE 
leaves room to approve, at least somewhat, of GE in general 
and  still  take  a  negative  stance  on  the  resolution.  To 
claim  that  there  are  too  many  other  problems  that  demand 
our  resources,  such  that  we  should  not  vigorously  pursue 
something  as  risky  and  uncertain  as  GE,  was  a  good 
strategy,  and  went  almost  completely  ignored  by  the 
affirmative  team.  Though  I  believe  that  the  negative  team 
won  this  issue  in  the  debate  (almost  by  default),  I  am  not 
personally  convinced  that  it  is  sound  reasoning.  That  is,  I 

am  not  convinced  that  vigorous  pursuit  of  genetic 
engineering  really  competes  very  much  for  resources  with 
the  other  projects  we  should  pursue.  Even  if  we  commit 
ourselves  to  solving  the  various  other  problems  that  the 
negative  team  pointed  out,  there  may  still  be  plenty  of 
room  (and  resources)  to  pursue  genetic  engineering,  even 
vigorously. 
 
The  negative  team  offered  a  number  of  other  compelling 
points,  and  overall  had  a  much  broader  range  of  arguments 
than  the  affirmative’s  single-minded  strategy,  but  many  of 
these  points  would  have  been  more  effective  had  they  been 
better  defended.  The  issue  of  risk  for  instance  was  not 
analyzed  enough  to  become  much  more  than  a  shouting  match 
between  the  two  sides.  But  the  negative  team  could  have 
pointed to much more specific examples of the ways in which 
GE  is  a  risky  proposition.  Alex’s  rebuttal  speech  did  offer 
some of these arguments, and they were good ones, but these 
arguments  should  have  been  introduced  earlier  in  the  round. 
The  heartiness  and  disease  resistance  of  genetically 
engineered  plants  cuts  both  ways;  though  they  require  less 
pesticides  they  also  tend  to  produce  stronger  pests. 
Moreover,  genetically  engineered  crops  are  hard  to  test  for 
safety;  they  tend  to  escape  the  fields  in  which  they  are 
grown  and  take  over  other  fields,  wiping  out  other  strains 
of  the  crop  and  disrupting  ecosystems.  There  is  empirical 
evidence  of  this  happening  already,  as  farmers  who  grow 
non-GE  crops  have  discovered  that  their  fields  are  hosting 
hybrids  and  GE  crops  from  neighboring  “experiments.”  These 
sorts  of  arguments  and  evidence  could  have  swung  the 
question of risk in favor of the negative. 
 
Otherwise,  I  want  to  reemphasize  that  I  am  impressed  and 
pleased  at  the  progress  we  have  seen  in  the  debates  this 
semester.  Every  speaker  was  articulate.  Each  speech  was 
better  organized.  And  the  arguments  were  meaningful  and 
real. Great job, and a most enjoyable debate to witness. 

Carolyn, 
 
Your  debate  speech  demonstrated  an  unheralded  mastery  over 
your  nerves.  Your  pace  was  excellent  and  your  words 
articulate  without  ever  seeming  forced  or  unconscious.  You 
treated  the  subject  matter  with  an  appropriate  gravity  but 
were  still  able  to  understand  it  personally.  I  quite 
enjoyed  your  comment  about  seedless  watermelon:  “which  I 
personally  happen  to  like  very  much.”  You  came  across  as 
human  and  individual  while  still  expert  and  engaged  in  your 
topic.  There  were  no  ums  or  awkward  pauses.  You  made  sure 
to  include  a  clear  introduction  and  conclusion.  Excellent 
job. 
 
My  only  criticism  of  the  speech  is  the  same  one  I  leveled 
at  the  affirmative  team  in  general:  it  relied  on  a  list  of 
examples,  as  though  in  themselves  they  constitute  an 
argument.  To  some  extent,  this  was  an  appropriate  strategy 
for  the  first  affirmative  speech,  showing  what’s  great 
about  genetic  engineering  and  then  waiting  for  the  negative 
team’s  challenge.  But  it  probably  would  have  been  even 
stronger  to  anticipate  some  of  the  potential  sources  of 
controversy  surrounding  your  topic  and  stake  your  claim 
before  the  argument  even  gets  started.  This  would  have 
advanced  the  debate  itself  while  also  tilting  things  toward 
the affirmative side. 
 
Your  cross-examinations  were  also  very  well  conducted. 
Alex’s  interrogation  of  you  was  a  great  question  period, 
with  Alex  asking  leading  questions  and  you  offering  honest 
but  powerful  responses.  You  refused  to  fall  into  his  trap, 
thoughtfully  admitting  to  the  subtlety  of  the  situation 
without  giving  much  ground.  Your  cross-examination  of  Asiri 
was  a  bit  more  iffy,  as  you  allowed  Asiri  to  be  the 
aggressor,  and  though  his  questions  kept  you  off  balance  in 
the  first  half  of  the  cross-x  period,  you  reversed  the 
momentum  in  the  second  half,  as  Asiri  seemed  to  lose  track 
of  the  argument.  It’s  kind  of  a  debater’s  trick,  but  it  is 
often  effective  to  stick  to  your  role  in  a  cross-
examination,  refusing  to  answer  questions  if  you  are  the 
interrogator  and  waiting  to  be  asked  one  if  you  are  the 
interrogated. 
 
In  general,  the  strength  of  your  speaking  was  its  candor, 
as  you  addressed  the  issues  without  hype  and  with  great 
clarity and conviction.

Linda, 
 
Your  opening  speech  for  the  negative  side  of  the  resolution 
had  the  great  advantage  of  being  filled  with  substantive 
arguments.  A  number  of  these  arguments  were  simply  not 
addressed  by  affirmative  responses  and,  as  such,  were 
successful  by  default  (though  I’m  not  really  keeping 
score).  Though  some  of  these  arguments  seemed  to  me 
somewhat  contrived  or  poorly  aimed,  most  were  sound  and 
could  have  been  further  pursued  to  dig  deeper  into  the 
nature of the resolution. 
 
Overall,  my  sense  is  that  this  speech  would  have  been  more 
effective  had  there  been  fewer  arguments  offered  in  at  a 
slower  pace  and  with  more  explanation  surrounding  each.  For 
instance,  your  opening  claim  about  the  pressing  importance 
of many other problems that have nothing to do with genetic 
engineering  is  a  good  point.  But  for  this  point  to  really 
hit  home,  you  would  need  to  offer  a  more  thoughtful 
analysis  of  your  various  comparisons,  showing  in  each  case 
that  the  problem  in  question  really  is  more  pressing  than 
the  ones  that  GE  proposes  to  solve  and  that  the  problem  in 
question will not get solved by the vigorous pursuit of GE. 
If  the  lack  of  clean  water  really  is  our  greatest  concern, 
are  you  certain  that  genetic  engineering  offers  no  promise 
to  solve  this  problem?  And  disease,  which  was  second  on 
your  list  of  problems,  seems  like  an  ideal  candidate  for 
treatment  by  GE.  My  point  is  not  that  you  were  wrong  to 
raise  this  issue.  Rather,  by  rattling  off  this  list  without 
really  thinking  about  each  case,  you  are  asking  your 
audience  to  take  it  on  faith  that  your  argument  makes 
sense,  and  this  serves  neither  your  audience  nor  the  truth. 
Even  something  like  “civil  wars  in  Africa”  might 
potentially  be  allayed  through  genetic  engineering,  if, 
that  is,  GE  lives  up  to  its  promise  of  making  food 
plentiful and cheap around the world. (It’s a big IF, and I 
have  no  faith  that  GE  is  the  right  solution  to  our  social 
problems, but simply to assert that GE is unrelated to such 
problems is inadequate.) 
 
As  I  said  in  my  general  comments,  your  claim  about  the  gap 
between  rich  and  poor  was  to  me  the  strongest  and  most 
interesting  issue  in  the  debate.  However,  as  I  also  said, 
the  introduction  of  this  issue  in  terms  of  “choice-based 
liberalism”  was  at  best  distracting  and  at  worst  confusing. 
There  are  undoubtedly  ethical  issues  that  arise  when 
messing  directly  with  human  DNA,  but  to  locate  these 

ethical  issues  in  the  question  of  fetal  choice  (as  a 
political  question)  is  rather  too  indirect.  That  is,  the 
ethical  questions  about  genetic  engineering  are  not 
primarily  questions  about  consensual  testing,  even  if  such 
questions  of  consent  are  somewhere  at  the  periphery  of  the 
ethics  of  GE.  And  fetal  consent  is  only  remotely  tied  to 
choice-based  liberalism,  which  would  need  to  be  defended  as 
a  valuable  basis  for  organizing  society  if  it  is  supposed 
to  serve  as  a  platform  for  claims  made  during  the  debate. 
As  such,  my  sense  is  that  this  issue  was  just  the  wrong 
focus,  but  perhaps  it  could  have  been  salvaged  had  you 
slowed down and examined it more carefully. 
 
Your  cross-examinations  were  very  entertaining.  Samantha’s 
questions  for  you  led  to  some  excellent  clash,  and  where 
you  were  unwilling  to  clash  you  cleverly  answered  a 
different  question  from  the  one  you  were  asked.  A  weaker 
debater  would  have  given  ground  during  this  cross-
examination,  but  you  managed  to  hold  yours  quite  well.  Your 
examination  of  Jiji  was  less  gratifying,  as  the  clash  was 
more  emotional  than  conceptual;  she  completely  failed  to 
answer  most  of  your  questions,  and  you  came  across  as  more 
expert,  but  you  could  probably  have  made  her  look  even 
worse  by  remaining  calm  and  showing  her  to  be  the  one  who 
is  flustered  and  confused.  On  balance,  your  cross-
examinations  are  exemplars  for  the  class,  and  I  hope 
everyone else was paying attention.

Jiji, 
 
Your  second  affirmative  speech  was  a  bit  of  a 
contradiction.  You  included  lots  of  excellent  phrasings  and 
many  superb  examples  of  the  benefits  of  genetic 
engineering.  But,  as  most  of  your  speech  was  prewritten, 
your  verbatim  reading  kept  you  from  making  good  contact 
with  your  audience,  and  you  did  not  do  enough  to  address 
the  concerns  raised  in  the  first  negative  speech.  My  sense 
is  that  this  position  in  the  debate,  second  speaker  on 
either  team,  calls  for  a  maximum  of  flexibility,  as  you 
have to respond to the other side while continuing to raise 
original  arguments  for  your  own  position.  Writing  out  parts 
of  your  speech  beforehand  allows  you  to  be  extra 
articulate, but limits your flexibility. 
 
Though  your  pace  was  fantastic  and  words  utterly  clear  and 
well  chosen,  your  affect  seemed  somewhat  flat,  as  though 
you  were  not  investing  your  words  with  meaning  in  the 
moment.  This  is  one  of  the  risks  of  reading,  as  it  is 
difficult  to  make  words  come  alive  when  read  aloud.  Perhaps 
it  was  also  an  artifact  of  the  comparison  between  your 
speech  and  the  others  around  you,  as  you  came  across  as 
very  knowledgeable  but  slightly  disinterested.  You  did  do  a 
good  job  of  organizing  your  ideas,  and  your  conclusion, 
though  possibly  too  brief,  was  a  smart  way  of  leaving  your 
audience with a clear summary of your perspective. 
 
Your  arguments  did  not  engage  quite  enough  with  the 
negative points. Though you went over a couple of them, you 
then  fell  back  on  your  team’s  strategy  of  listing  the  good 
things  that  GE  can  do.  These  are  compelling  reasons  you 
offer  to  pursue  GE,  but  if  they  don’t  reckon  with  the 
objections,  the  audience  is  left  with  no  clear  way  to 
decide which policy to favor. 
 
Your  cross-examination  by  Linda  was  very  entertaining,  as 
your aplomb seemed to get her a bit flustered. My sense was 
that  you  weren’t  quite  answering  the  questions,  but  you 
offered  your  responses  with  confidence  and  directness, 
making  them  seem  believable  even  if  slightly  off  target. 
Linda  didn’t  manage  to  really  pin  you  down,  but  you  might 
have  avoided  giving  the  impression  of  being  slightly  cagey 
had  you  offered  more  confrontational  answers.  On  the 
question  of  fetal  choice,  for  instance,  it  would  have  been 
more  direct  just  to  point  out  that  fetuses  never  get  a 
choice about their lives. 

 
Overall,  you  have  great  poise  and  delivery  and  could  be  a 
very  imposing  debater.  But  it  would  require  staying  more  in 
the  moment,  keeping  your  ideas  in  play  in  your  head,  and 
offering  them  to  your  audience  with  that  same  crystal 
clarity. 
1.2 out of 2 

Asiri, 
 
Your  second  negative  speech  was  the  strongest  I  have  seen 
you  deliver  yet  this  semester.  The  facts  and  argument  you 
made,  especially  at  the  beginning  of  the  speech,  not  only 
advanced  the  negative  position  but  gave  you  an  air  of 
authority  and  expertise  that  made  subsequent  claims  all  the 
more  believable.  Your  delivery  was  clear,  and  I  didn’t 
notice any “fading out” at the ends of your sentences. Your 
style  was  casual  and  direct,  but  thoughtful  at  the  same 
time,  and  you  seemed  to  take  your  own  arguments  seriously. 
Good job. 
 
This  speech  also  had  some  weaknesses.  A  couple  of  the 
points  were  not  adequately  explained  or  analyzed  (your 
single  sentence  about  biodiversity,  for  instance).  And  you 
seemed  to  lose  strength  as  the  speech  went  on;  the 
arguments  near  the  end  were  much  less  developed  and 
articulate.  Ending  abruptly  with  no  conclusion  was  also 
probably  a  mistake,  as  you  should  at  least  put  in  a  short 
sentence  reminding  your  audience  who  to  “vote”  for.  But  the 
first  part  of  your  speech  demonstrates  your  increasing 
ability at this task. 
 
Your  cross-examination  session  with  Carolyn  was  also  very 
well  done.  You  did  a  great  job  taking  the  upper  hand  in 
this  interrogation  period,  as  you  almost  immediately  became 
the  questioner,  putting  her  on  the  defensive.  You  seemed 
most  confident  regarding  this  issue  of  risk,  so  it  worked 
in your favor that this issue dominated most of the cross-x 
session.  Like  in  the  speech,  you  seemed  to  falter  a  bit 
near the end of the question period, as Carolyn got back on 
track  as  the  questioner,  and  you  weren’t  sure  how  to  fend 
off  her  continued  challenges  to  your  examples.  Still, 
neither  side  gained  ground  here,  and  you  explained  your 
ideas well. Overall nice job and most entertaining. 
1.4 out of 2 

Alex, 
 
Your  negative  rebuttal  speech  offered  a  great  deal  of 
substantive  commentary,  taking  the  various  complexities  of 
the  debate  and  describing  them  in  terms  both  subtle  and 
concrete.  That  is,  your  strength  in  this  speech  was  to 
respect  the  complexity  of  the  ideas  you  were  discussing 
while  still  making  genuine  interventions.  There  was  a  sense 
in  your  speech  that  the  ideas  had  been  up  until  that  point 
somehow  uncertain,  that  the  clash  had  been  emotionally 
apparent  but  conceptually  hazy.  Your  speech  resolved  that 
haziness,  not  only  by  taking  a  clear  side,  but  also  by 
explaining in clear terms what the debate was about to that 
point. Excellent job. 
 
In  some  ways,  the  primary  flaw  in  your  speech  is  that  it 
didn’t  come  earlier  in  the  debate  round.  This  is  partly 
because  you  were  advancing  some  arguments  whose  novelty  was 
questionable;  that  is,  debating  rules  require  that  rebuttal 
speeches  refrain  from  introducing  new  arguments,  though 
they  may  certainly  rebut  old  arguments  and  rephrase  or 
further  explain  already  existing  arguments.  Maybe  I  was 
fooled  by  the  clarity  of  your  explanations  into  thinking 
that  you  were  making  up  a  new  argument  rather  than  just 
reiterating an older one. In any case, this kind of clarity 
earlier  in  the  debate  would  have  taken  the  debate  to 
another level. 
 
Your  claims  were  themselves  compelling,  and  I  must  admit 
that  this  was  the  only  point  in  the  debate  when  the 
negative  side  seemed  appealing  to  me.  (I  don’t  mean  to  say 
that  the  affirmative  team  had  me  convinced;  for  the  most 
part,  I  found  neither  side  terribly  convincing,  but  your 
arguments  were  the  ones  I  felt  I  most  needed  to  reckon 
with,  given  my  prior  leanings  toward  the  affirmative  on 
this  resolution.)  This  strong  content  was  packaged  in  a 
direct  and  confident  manner  that  did  not  become  cocky  or 
aggressive.  This  was  a  good  tone  to  take.  Your  introduction 
and conclusion helped to keep the audience on track. 
 
Your  cross-examination  performance  was  also  strong,  though 
not  compelling  in  the  same  way.  You  were  trying  to  open  up 
a gap around the word “vigorously,” a gap that the negative 
team  planned  to  exploit  with  a  wedge  later.  While  your 
strategy was a good one, Carolyn gave great answers to your 
queries,  offering  direct  responses  instead  of  evasive  ones, 
and  even  allowing  for  significant  subtlety  in  her 

evaluation  of  the  situation.  The  result  was  that  “vigorous” 
was  still  up  for  grabs  at  the  end  of  the  interrogation, 
your  strong  questions  having  been  met  by  equally  strong 
answers. 
1.8 out of 2 

Samantha, 
 
Your  closing  speech  packaged  strong  content,  responding 
directly  to  the  chief  attacks  by  the  negative  team.  You 
augmented  your  responses  with  good  control  over  your  tone 
of  voice,  as  you  seemed  both  impassioned  and  serious.  Your 
use of intonation and pace was the strongest in the debate, 
and  your  commitment  to  the  issue  really  helps  to  make  your 
speech  engaging  and  believable.  You  even  came  across  as 
incredulous  regarding  some  of  the  negative  claims,  and 
while  this  technique  could  get  overused,  you  pulled  it  off 
quite well. 
 
The  organization  of  your  speech  was  not  as  strong,  however. 
Too  often  you  seemed  to  be  providing  a  list  of  arguments, 
and  you  didn’t  do  enough  to  contextualize  these  arguments. 
Starting an objection with “You say that … but actually …,” 
does  demonstrate  your  own  involvement  in  the  issue,  but  it 
doesn’t  give  the  audience  time  to  get  their  heads  around 
these  things.  Instead,  you  should  briefly  explain  the 
negative’s  position,  speaking  to  the  audience,  then  offer 
your  response  to  it.  Try  to  find  ways  to  segue  from  one 
argument  to  the  next,  and  give  your  listeners  a  sense  of 
what  is  most  important.  This  is  my  old  complaint  about 
architecture  in  a  speech:  organize  it  around  something  more 
than a list of ideas. 
 
And  architecture  might  have  helped  you  to  make  stronger 
arguments  as  well.  My  sense  (and  I  could  be  wrong)  is  that 
you  got  distracted  by  certain  aspects  of  the  debate  that 
may  not  really  have  been  central.  As  the  rebuttal  speaker, 
your  job  is  to  choose  only  those  issues  that  have  risen  to 
the  very  top  of  the  debate,  to  highlight  the  affirmative 
perspective  on  the  “voting  issues.”  Instead,  your  need  to 
discuss  cloning  seemed  somewhat  renegade,  as  the  negative 
team  had  not  been  talking  about  cloning  (even  if  they  had 
discussed  some  related  issues).  This  fixation  on  a  “pet” 
topic  is  particularly  ineffective  when  you  don’t  explain  to 
the  audience  the  overall  relevance  of  this  topic  to  your 
argument.  Had  you  explained  in  slow,  clear  terms  that 
cloning  can  serve  as  a  representative  issue  for  all  of  the 
different  issues  surrounding  human  genetic  engineering,  and 
had  you  made  this  claim  believable,  then  perhaps  your 
argument would have held more weight. 
 
Your  cross-examination  of  Linda  was  a  good  moment  in  the 
debate,  and  helped  to  heat  up  the  exchange  between  the  two 

teams.  You  were  asking  relevant,  aggressive  questions,  and 
Linda  managed  to  meet  your  questions  with  believable, 
consistent  responses.  Neither  of  you  gained  the  upper  hand 
during  this  interrogation,  but  only  because  you  both  did 
very good jobs.
