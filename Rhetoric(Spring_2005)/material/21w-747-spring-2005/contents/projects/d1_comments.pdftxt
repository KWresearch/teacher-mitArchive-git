General Remarks: 
 
Both  teams  in  this  debate  did  a  good  job  of  presenting 
arguments,  and  each  team  made  a  number  of  effective  points. 
Some  of  these  points  began  to  get  at  the  crux  of  the 
distinction  between  speaking  and  writing,  although  it  often 
seemed  as  though  neither  team  was  aware  of  their  most 
crucial  points.  As  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  this 
debate  were  common  to  both  sides,  most  of  my  comments  will 
be  general  and  directed  at  all  four  participants.  I  will 
also  provide  each  debater  with  some  brief  commentary  on  his 
or  her  individual  performance,  focusing  primarily  on  style 
of speech rather than content, but those individual comments 
will be sent to the individuals and not made public. 
 
Each  team  wisely  made  some  attempt  to  define  terms  at  the 
outset  of  the  debate.  Only  the  affirmative  team  seemed 
willing  to  return  to  these  definitions  though,  and  even  the 
affirmative team regarded the definitions as one issue among 
many  rather  than  a  central  and  unifying  component  of  the 
argument.  This  inadequate  attention  to  definitions  is 
chiefly  responsible  for  the  overall  scattered  character  of 
the  debate.  While  each  team  responded  to  arguments  on  the 
other side, it never became clear to the debaters nor to the 
audience just what the key issues to consider were. What was 
really being argued about? 
 
It  is  therefore  symptomatic  that  neither  team  actually 
mentioned  the  resolution  in  the  entire  debate.  The  teams 
weren’t  sure  what  exactly  they  were  arguing  about.  In  a 
debate  over  a  resolution,  a  careful  look  at  that  resolution 
can  often  reveal  strategic  possibilities,  or  subtle  aspects 
of  the  debate  that  could  play  in  favor  of  one  side  or  the 
other.  In  this  debate,  not  only  were  the  ideas  of  speaking 
and writing important, but so should have been the notion of 
inferior.  What  would  make  one  medium  inferior  to  another? 
Without some sense of what inferior  is  supposed  to mean, we 
have  no  basis  on  which  to  judge  success  in  the  debate.  The 
affirmative  team  was  heading  in  the  right  direction  when 
they  offered  a  definition  of  effective  communication,  but 
even then, this definition should have been consistently and 
immediately  related  back  to  a  resolution.  The  negative 
missed  a  major  opportunity  by  not  taking  advantage  of  the 
presumption built in to the resolution: they did not need to 
show  that  writing  was  better  than  speech,  only  that  writing 
was  not  inferior  to  speech.  One  way,  for  example,  to  show 
that writing is not inferior is to argue that both forms of 
communication are utterly essential, and as such neither can 
be  dispensed  with.  Or  the  negative  team  might  have  argued 
that  writing  cannot  be  strictly  distinguished  from  speech, 
and  so  cannot  be  judged  inferior.  The  bottom  line  is  that 
without  an  examination  of  the  resolution,  debaters  and 
judges  have  no  strong  sense  of  what  they  are  arguing  about 
or how to decide. 

 
This  weakness  —   t he  lack  of  central  argument 
—  
characterized  not  only  the  content  of  the  debate  but  also 
the  form  of  the  individual  speeches.  Without  some  sort  of 
center to the arguments, each speech tended to be a list of 
points,  with  no  unifying  principle  and  no  rhetorical 
structure. A list of points is difficult to keep in mind (as 
the  negative  team  sometimes  pointed  out  in  the  midst  of 
their list!), so such a list is not only hard to follow but 
generally not very compelling. 
 
To  correct  this  deficit,  I  offer  a  number  of  pieces  of 
advice for future speech-makers. First, choose one (or maybe 
a few) themes, a basic point that you want your audience to 
bear  in  mind,  and  return  to  this  theme  throughout  your 
speech. But don’t just repeat it for the sake of hearing it 
again;  rather,  in  the  course  of  making  your  detailed 
arguments,  show  how  those  arguments  are  related  to  that 
basic  theme.  In  this  debate,  the  theme  might  have  been 
nothing  more  than  a  statement  of  the  resolution,  but  both 
teams  would  have  done  much  better  to  spell  out  the 
consequences  of  their  arguments  rather  than  just  offering 
the arguments. When you are giving a speech, it is too easy 
to become caught up in your own ideas, and you don’t always 
realize  that  your  audience  is  not  necessarily  drawing  the 
same conclusions or seeing the same points that are clear in 
your  head.  You  are  better  off  spelling  it  out,  drawing  the 
connection explicitly to avoid misunderstanding. 
 
Second, try to have a shape to your speech. As Plato says, a 
good  speech  has  a  beginning,  a  middle,  and  an  end.  While 
this  sort  of  structuring  can  be  very  difficult  in  an 
impromptu speech,  you  should do your  best to  have some  sort 
of  architecture.  Before  starting  to  speak,  write  down  a 
couple  of  lines  of  conclusion  that  summarize  your  best 
arguments  and  tell  the  audience  why  your  side  is  correct. 
Then read these lines at the end of your speech, driving the 
final  nail  into  the  opponent’s  coffin.  Think  of  some  device 
(acrostic,  catchphrase,  break  down  of  the  subject)  that 
could  organize your  points.  Even if  your points are  just in 
an outline, let your audience  see the shape of this outline 
by  saying  it  out  loud,  reminding  everyone  of  what  you  have 
already said and what you are about to say. 
 
Third,  be  explicitly  rhetorical.  Use  alliteration.  Make 
jokes.  Be  sarcastic.  Vary  the  pitch  of  your  voice.  Pretend 
to  be  a  character  for  part  of  your  speech.  Argue  with 
yourself.  Be  dramatic.  Gesticulate.  Emote.  Look  someone  in 
the  eye.  Put  on  airs.  Use  famous  quotations.  Repeat  a 
catchphrase  at  selected  moments.  Etcetera,  etcetera.  Of 
course,  any  of  these  techniques  must  be  used  wisely,  as 
superfluous  or  unnecessary  rhetorical  flourish  will  just 
look  silly  or  obvious.  But  when  used  well,  these  techniques 
add  a  great  deal  of  interest  to  your  speech,  not  only 

drawing  the  attention  and  sympathy  of  your  audience,  but 
shaping your ideas as well. These things are also hard to do 
on  the  spur  of  the  moment.  I  recommend  that  you  practice 
doing  them,  perhaps  with  your  debate  partner.  Give 
spontaneous  speeches  to  each  other  when  you  are  practicing, 
and  see  if  you  can’t  find  ways  of  injecting  some  of  these 
performance techniques. 
 
To  return  to  the  issue  of  content,  my  sense  is  that  both 
sides had trouble thinking through the sheer conceptual size 
of  this  topic.  Rather  than  focusing  on  the  essences  of 
speaking  and  writing,  each  team  focused  on  certain 
particulars.  In  fact,  most  of  the  remarks  about  speech 
seemed  to  have  in  mind  something  like  delivering  a  speech, 
whereas  speech  itself  is  clearly  much  broader.  Delivering  a 
speech  is  only  one  example,  and  rather  a  strange  one. 
Speech,  as  opposed  to  writing,  is  marked  by  spontaneity,  a 
fact  that  both  teams  referred  to  but  didn’t  make  central. 
Also,  speech  is  famously  associated  with  presence,  that  is, 
with the presence of the speaker. While the affirmative team 
recognized  this  and  based  many  arguments  on  it,  these 
arguments  looked  more  at  the  superficial  effects  of  this 
supposed  presence  rather  than  looking  at  its  essential 
nature. I had imagined that Plato’s Phaedrus would point the 
debaters  in  the  right  direction;  Socrates  relates  the  story 
of  the  Egyptian  god  Theuth,  who  invents  writing  but, 
according to the story, completely mistakes its effects. 
 
Both  teams  hint  at  the  essences  of  speaking  and  writing 
without  pointing  to  them  directly.  If  writing  is  better 
suited  for  storage,  why  is  this,  what  does  this  tell  us 
about  what  writing  is?  (Writing  is  graphical  rather  than 
acoustic,  so  it  can  be  stored  as  material.  Writing  is  two-
dimensional.  Writing  has  a  very  different  temporality 
associated  with  it,  in  many  ways.  Each  team  noticed  these 
things,  but  neither  team  insisted  on  these  characteristics 
as  essential.  The  emphasis  I  put  on  definition  was  intended 
to  point  debaters  toward  the  essential  character  of  their 
terms.)  If  speaking  can  be  understood  to  some  extent  by 
someone  who  does  not  share  the  spoken  language,  what  is 
there  in  speech  that  exceeds  the  meanings  of  the  words? 
Where  does  this  affective  or  emotional  element  come  from  in 
the  speech?  These  are  only  examples  of  questions  that  point 
toward the basic natures of the two terms, but these are the 
questions  that  the  debate  might  usefully  have  pursued  with 
greater intensity. 
 
I regard this first debate as a learning experience, and the 
debaters  are  not  being  penalized  for  having  to  go  first. 
Moreover,  there  were  many  strengths  in  this  debate, 
including a number of points where arguments seemed to reach 
out  of  the  murk  and  achieve  a  kind  of  clarity.  All 
participants  are  to  be  congratulated  for  holding  up  under 
the  gaze  of  their  classmates  and  the  even  more  intimidating 

blank  stare  of  the  camera.  We  will  discuss  the  debate 
further on Tuesday. 

Kevin, 
 
Your  two  speeches  were  as  strong  as  any  in  the  debate.  You 
spoke  clearly  and  were  only  a  little  too  fast,  with  no 
obvious  verbal  tics  (“ u m, ”   “ l ike, ”   “ ya  know, ”   e tc.) 
Your  points  were  consistently  understandable,  as  your 
listeners  were  not  only  able  to  follow  your  individual 
points  but  also  could  relate  these  points  to  the  larger 
claim that framed your speech. 
 
Still,  the  general  criticism  that  I  offered  to  everyone 
applies  in  your  case  as  well.  Your  speeches  were  not 
especially  dynamic,  coming  across  as  a  list  of  arguments 
rather  than  an  impassioned  attempt  to  persuade.  Though  you 
wisely  offered  definitions  at  the  outset  of  your  opening 
speech,  you  didn’t  refer  back  to  these  definitions  much,  so 
they  failed  to  earn  much  weight  in  the  debate  overall.  And 
though  you  were  very  clear,  you  were  also  very  “ f lat ”   in 
your  presentation,  as  you  didn’t  use  tempo,  dynamics,  or 
pitch to good effect in making your points. 
 
The  cross-examinations  were  generally  not  very  strong  in 
this  debate,  probably  because  no  one  really  knew  what  to 
argue about. Nevertheless, I thought you held up rather well 
to Carolyn’s scattered interrogation of you after your first 
speech,  as  you  answered  her  questions  directly  and  candidly 
without  giving  up  any  ground.  Your  cross-examination  of  her 
was  more  organized,  but  my  sense  was  that  Carolyn  also 
didn’t  really  give  you  any  openings,  seemingly  having 
reasonable answers to your questions. 
 
Your  rebuttal  speech  was  probably  the  best  attempt  in  the 
debate  to  win  favor  with  the  hypothetical  judges,  as  you 
tried  to  point  out  some  “ v oting  issues. ”   This  was 
certainly  the  right  strategy  to  take,  and  if  it  was  not 
wholly  successful,  that  is  only  because  you  didn’t  have  a 
lot of great material to work with. 
 
Overall,  a  good  job,  one  that  your  classmates  can  learn 
from.

Samantha, 
 
Your  speeches  were  the  most  dynamic  and  exciting  of  the 
debate. 
You 
injected 
some 
personality 
into 
your 
presentation,  which  made  it  more  engaging  and  more 
persuasive.  You  could  go  still  farther  in  this  direction, 
adding even more rhetorical flourish where it fits. However, 
the  flip  side  of  this  dynamism  is  that  it  can  result  in  a 
lack  of  clarity,  and  your  speeches  at  times  suffered  from 
this  too,  especially  because  you  tended  to  speak  rather  too 
quickly.  Your  enthusiasm  or  emotional  investment  does  not 
necessarily make the concept clear to your audience, so make 
sure to explain fully even while you show your commitment to 
your ideas. 
 
Otherwise,  the  comments  I  offered  to  everyone  apply  to  your 
speeches  as  well.  There  was  little  sense  of  an  overarching 
argument,  and  you  quite  explicitly  offered  listeners  a  list 
of  claims  rather  than  an  organized  or  progressive 
investigation of your topic. You generally didn’t even frame 
your  speeches  by  telling  us  your  basic  position,  and  this 
severely  impaired  the  power  of  your  subsequent  claims.  You 
don’t  want  to  give  listeners  a  sense  of  checking  items  off 
of  a  list;  rather,  you  want  to  give  them  a  sense  of  a 
penetrating and comprehensive approach to a complex topic. 
 
Alex’s  cross-examination  of  you  was  typical  of  the  debate, 
in  that  you  offered  correct  and  defensible  responses  to  his 
questions,  but  it  wasn’t  clear  what  was  at  stake  in  this 
question  period.  Your  interrogation  of  him,  on  the  other 
hand, was the one x-exam period in the debate where it felt 
as though the two sides were really beginning to argue. Your 
opening  question  about  how  to  address  a  large  number  of 
people  started  to  unpeel  some  layers  from  the  proverbial 
onion,  and  for  at  least  a  moment,  we  felt  as  though  the 
argument  was  beginning  to  get  at  something  significant.  You 
kept this heat on during the question period, and might have 
exploited some of this material more effectively later on. 
 
Overall, you did a good job of inventing original arguments, 
borrowing  from  your  intuition,  providing  provocative  and 
interesting sources (on your slides, mostly), and presenting 
with flair and personality. The key down the road will be to 
hone in on the  most crucial  and telling arguments, in  order 
to really pin down the topic.

Alex, 
 
Your  speech  seemed  the  most  comfortable  of  the  debate.  Your 
pacing  was  excellent  and  your  tone  quite  clear.  You  were 
also  the  only  speaker  to  make  use  of  any  significant 
rhetorical  flourish  (when  you  appeared  to  search  for  the 
word,  “ radio ” ) ,  and  this  was  a  good  moment.  I  think  that 
still  more  dynamism  could  have  helped  this  speech. 
Furthermore,  the  general  remarks  that  I  sent  to  everyone 
apply  also  to  your  speech:  there  was  not  enough  centrality 
or  organization  of  argument.  You  offered  a  list  of  points 
rather  than  a  progressive  examination  and  conclusion.  While 
your  Forrest  Gump  conclusion  demonstrates  a  certain  measure 
of  humor,  it  isn’t  really  a  good  way  to  end  a  speech,  at 
least not unless you have already provided a more conclusive 
conclusion prior to those words. 
 
You  deserve  credit  for  coming  up  with  some  good  original 
arguments,  however.  My  sense  is  that  your  ideas  approached 
most  closely  to  an  investigation  of  an  essence  of  speaking 
and  writing,  although  I  am  not  sure  that  you  were  aware  of 
this proximity. In your writing, I hope you will pursue your 
thoughts as far as they can take you. 
 
Your  cross-examinations  were  professional  and  organized  if 
not  quite  revelatory.  When  you  interrogated  Samantha,  it 
wasn’t  quite  clear  whether  the  questions  were  going 
anywhere,  and  she  seemed  to  have  pretty  good  responses  that 
kept  you  from  scoring  any  points.  Her  cross-examination  of 
you seemed more heated, as there was a sense that one of you 
might  fall  of  an  edge  if  he  or  she  didn’t  choose  words 
carefully.  You  did,  however,  manage  to  choose  your  words 
well,  and  didn’t  allow  Samantha  to  gain  any  significant 
territory.  This  was  the  moment  where  the  debate  seemed  most 
intense.

Carolyn, 
 
Your  speech  was  quite  clear,  though  probably  the  least 
dynamic  of  the  debate.  You  offered  a  number  of  interesting 
points, and this  speech could  have been very  strong  had  you 
chosen  to  highlight  some  of  these  points  instead  of 
presenting them as a list. You deserve  credit  for coming up 
with  these  ideas,  including  the  revolutionary  value  of  the 
printing press and the huge advantage of writing as a medium 
for  storage.  But,  without  telling  your  audience  how 
important  these  particular  issues  are,  they  just  fade  into 
the  background  of  your  list  of  claims,  and  don’t  sway  your 
audience to believe you over the other team. 
 
You  seemed  fairly  nervous  addressing  the  group,  and  you 
wisely turned this into a humorous advantage by remarking on 
it  at  the  outset  of  your  speech.  Still,  this  class  is 
intended to provide you with the opportunity to address your 
concerns about public speaking, and I hope you will continue 
to practice both  in  class and  elsewhere  to  overcome some of 
your anxiety. I know of no particular tricks to dealing with 
fear  of  public  speaking  short  of  practicing  a  lot.  For  me, 
it  helps  a  great  deal  to  work  on  the  content  of  my  speech 
prior  to  delivering  it,  so  that  at  least  I’m  not  worried 
about whether I really have something to say or know what I 
am  talking  about.  You  might  also  try  thinking  of  it  as 
acting,  where  you  really  push  yourself  over  the  top, 
throwing caution to the wind. 
 
Your  initial  cross-examination  was  unprepared,  and  I’m  not 
sure why you didn’t see this coming. (It is explained in the 
formats for the debate on the MIT Server.) As such, you weren’t 
really  able  to  muster  good  questions,  and  the  interrogation 
was  a  bit  of  a  wash.  Kevin’s  cross-examination  of  you  was 
much  more  interesting,  as  he  seemed  to  have  some  real  and 
forceful questions, but you did a very good job of providing 
candid  answers  without  ceding  any  ground  to  the  other  team. 
It’s clear to me that you are a strong thinker, and when you 
get  absorbed  in  the  ideas,  your  anxiety  fades  into  the 
background.
