Truth and Rhetorical Effectiveness 

A speaker has two fundamental objectives. The first is to get an intended message across 

to an audience.  This transfer is facilitated by simplicity and clarity, which the speaker aims to 

achieve “through the structured use of symbols.”1  Speeches use the symbols of language and 

words.  The second aim of the speaker after clarifying his message is to persuade the audience to 

accept it.  It would seem that a speaker is more successful at accomplishing the two objectives 

when he has validity and truth on his side, but is his rhetoric just as effective without them? 

 

While the truths behind a message influence the effectiveness of a speaker, truths’ 

inherent, vague nature adds a dimension of uncertainty to its effect.  Two specific types of truths, 

quantitative and moral, can have differing effects on rhetorical successes. Quantitative truths deal 

with those aspects of nature that can be calculated, and the tangible, physical properties of 

systems.  On the other hand, moral truths are more abstract and subject to broad interpretation.  

In his The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, James Herrick conveniently 

categorizes the symbols and strategies used in persuasive argument into four categories – 

argument, appeals, arrangement, and aesthetics.2  With each type of truth, these four simple, yet 

very prevalent methods of persuasion offer different angles and dimensions from which to 

approach the truth’s influence on a speaker’s rhetoric. 

 

The seemingly uncomplicated nature of quantitative truths would suggest that its 

relationship with rhetorical success is the most straightforward of the ones aforementioned.  A 

quantitative truth’s “measurable” aspect implies that some form of experimentation was done to 

obtain the results the truth claims.  How certain chemicals react with each other is found through 

thorough laboratory work; the nature of our solar system has been extensively mapped by space 

probes.  A chemistry professor can clarify her work to her students through visual means.  She 

can take them to the lab, combust magnesium with oxygen, and show students the extremely 

bright light that results.  In another case, an astronomer can easily prove the spherical shape of 

the Earth today. He only has to pull up satellite images and point to the curvature displayed. 

 

Yet, that last truth, which we take for granted nowadays, was not taken so lightly just a 

few hundred years ago. Before the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century, Aristotle showed 

through valid scientific methods that the Earth was at the center of the solar system. Parallax 

states that “relative positions of distant fixed objects shift for a moving observer.” Classical 

astronomers convinced themselves and others that because the stars did not shift positions in the 

sky, the Earth must have been at the center.3 A fact that we know today to be false had convinced 

all the brightest intellectuals of the time of its “truth” through scientific arguments. People are 

readily persuaded by qualitative truths. 

 

The sway of moral truths over a rhetor’s effects, however, can be less concrete.  The 

concept of morality is debated in many circles and illustrations of what is or is not moral vary 

greatly.  Moral truths, in its general form, can be understood to refer to those principles that are 

ethical and right; principles that are accepted by a society who seeks to treat all its citizens with

respect and fairness.  A morality issue that has been repeatedly challenged in the past 100 years 

is human rights and justice. Has history given us advocates and opponents of this issue who were 

equally successful in spreading their message? 

 

The greatest war ever fought between nations produced two of the greatest orators, 

Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler.  Throughout World War II, Churchill advocated principles 

that are ethical and right; he endeavored to expand a society that sought to treat all its citizens 

with respect and fairness.  By these standards, Hitler did the exact opposite. He schemed to 

spread wealth to only a very specific and minute portion of the German people, and pushed 

forward institutionalized genocide with secret police and concentration camps.  However, both 

used their skills of rhetoric to rally populations behind them and advance their agendas. 

 

In one of history’s most moving and passionate speeches, Winston Churchill addressed 

the House of Commons to rally the British people in anticipation of the Battle of Britain, 

 

 

“We shall not flag nor fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France and on the seas 

and oceans; we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air. We shall 

defend our island whatever the cost may be; we shall fight on beaches, landing grounds, in fields, 

in streets and on the hills. We shall never surrender…”4

Aesthetically, he arranges this passage at the end of his speech giving the country’s status update 

to sum up his clear intention to never give up.  Churchill displays his resolve and commitment 

with lines of repetition.   In this particular speech, he argues for the strength of the British Fleet 

and her people.  He appeals to their patriotism to brace them for the oncoming Nazi assault, and 

in the end, he is successful in every way.

In his lifetime, Adolf Hitler rose to power in Nazi Germany by appealing to the hatred 

and bitterness harbored by the suppressed Germans.  His skillful rhetoric argued for and placed 

the blame for their defeat in World War I onto the Jewish population, first in Germany, then the 

world.  In the following excerpt, his demonstrates his blatant manipulation of language to 

promote genocide, 

 

 

“For us, this is not a problem you can turn a blind eye to-one to be solved by small 

concessions.  For us, it is a problem of whether our nation can ever recover its health, whether the 

Jewish spirit can ever really be eradicated.  Don't be misled into thinking you can fight a disease 

without killing the carrier, without destroying the bacillus.  Don't think you can fight racial 

tuberculosis without taking care to rid the nation of the carrier of that racial tuberculosis.  This 

Jewish contamination will not subside, this poisoning of the nation will not end, until the carrier 

himself, the Jew, has been banished from our midst.”5

By comparing the Jews to bacteria infesting a human body, he appeals to the German people’s 

sense of personal safety and natural tendency to want to wipe out foreign pathogens.  He evokes 

a sense of fear with repeated uses of the word “carrier” and successfully uses word choice to 

drive home his message of disgust for the Jewish people. 

 

In the case of qualitative truths, rhetoric is absolutely influenced by it.  People will need 

evidence and science when being persuaded of what they are told are “facts.”  Although the 

rhetoric needs “truth”, the “truth” itself doesn’t necessarily need reality.  The physical properties 

can be misinterpreted and used to lead the audience to a false understanding of the world around 

them.  However, in the case of morality, both the supporter and detractor of the truth (as accepted 

by a civilized society), are successful in clarifying their objectives and then persuading their 

audience.  The type of truth affects the success of the rhetoric.  A speaker’s success is

determined by the truth when that truth can be measured and shown.  A speaker’s skill, however, 

is the deciding factor in his efficiency and success in matters of moral concern.

Kevin, 
 
Your essay argues that different kinds of truths have different sorts of influence over rhetoric, 
and call for different approaches by the rhetor. This revision demonstrates an admirable clarity, 
both in the mechanics of your prose and in the overall shape of your argument. Your points flow 
logically from one to the next without redundancy and without becoming simply a list of 
evidence. You provide rich and evocative examples to illustrate your claims, which succeeds 
both in piquing your reader’s interest and in further clarifying and specifying your claims. 
Indeed, the strength of the essay rests on the value of your examples, and these examples hold up 
well under the weight of this argument. 
 
I have primarily two criticisms aimed at further improvement of this revision. The first and less 
important criticism is that the thesis statement could have been placed in the first paragraph in an 
imperative tone. The question that ends the first paragraph is not really the focus of the essay, 
and it would have been more informative to the reader to put your thesis there, namely, that 
quantitative truths play a role in rhetoric that relates to facts and indisputables, while moral truths 
leave more room for the skill of the rhetor. If this is your point, there is no reason not to state it 
up front. 
 
The second criticism is more general and more important. You should do more to bring out the 
complexity of your topic. It isn’t especially hard to accept the basic claim you make, that moral 
truths are more arguable than quantitative ones. You do go considerably beyond this basic claim 
in some key respects. For instance, you show that quantitative truths change over time, casting 
their solidness into doubt. You also complicate your analysis by showing moral debate in action, 
using quotes to demonstrate the ways in which moral truths can be pushed around to different 
effects. But these complexities could have gone still further. Just how malleable are quantitative 
truths? If they can change over time, what happens at the borders of those changes, how does 
rhetoric, normally subordinate to quantitative truth, somehow get hold of such a truth and alter 
it? Are the differences between quantitative truth and moral truth absolute, or is there a kind of 
middle ground or overlap? And how much latitude is there in moral truth? Can one make a 
convincing claim for any moral stance or are there limits? And if there are limits, where do they 
come from? Was it Churchill’s and Hitler’s rhetorical abilities that made them so successful, or 
was something else necessary for their arguments to work, something already at work in the 
audience to whom they were speaking? 
 
The point is not that you failed to answer one or more of these questions. The point is rather that 
the subject matter itself is of great import and extreme complexity. Rather than manifesting this 
complexity for your reader, you tie it into a neat bundle and draw a rather tame conclusion. For 
next time, stick out your neck a bit farther. Try to write about things that you don’t fully 
understand, or write at the very limits of your understanding. That’s where things get most 
interesting.
