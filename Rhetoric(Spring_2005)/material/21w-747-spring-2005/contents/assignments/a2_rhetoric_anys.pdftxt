Rhetoric, Assignment A2, Rhetorical Analysis 
 
This  essay  assignment  asks  you  to  perform  a  rhetorical  analysis. 
Choose  a  speech  given  by  a  U.S.  president  or  candidate  for 
president  and  analyze  it,  discussing  its  rhetorical  dimensions, 
their intended and unintentional functions, and their efficacy. 
 
The  greatest  challenge  of  this  essay  is  to  find  a  thesis  that 
will  motivate  your  rhetorical  analysis.  Your  paper  should  not  be 
a  list  of  the  rhetorical  devices  employed  in  the  text  under 
analysis,  nor  will  it  be  adequate  to  show  that  the  speech  (or 
other  object)  has  some  effective  rhetoric  and  some  ineffective 
rhetoric.  Rather,  your  essay  must  develop  an  insight  into  its 
topic, a discovery that sheds new light on the rhetorical object 
and  on  rhetoric  itself.  Your  essay  must  teach  its  readers 
something  about  the  speech  and  the  nature  of  rhetoric,  something 
challenging  or  subtle  that  they  would  not  have  known  themselves 
after looking at the same object. For instance, you might notice 
that  Bush  provides  much  more  detail  about  evil  than  about  good 
in one of his campaign speeches. Your essay could offer a theory 
to  explain  this  imbalance  in  terms  of  his  personality  or  speech 
writers  or  campaign  strategy  or  audience,  and  then  support  that 
theory  by  analyzing  the  specific  rhetoric  of  the  speech.  (Note 
that  my  hypothetical  example  does  not  specify  the  thesis  of  the 
essay,  which  would  be  a  claim  about  Bush’s  personality  or 
campaign strategy or …. The thesis will depend on the particular 
evidence available and your means of interpreting it.) 
 
Speeches  can  be  found  in  newspapers  and  on  the  web,  in  text, 
video, and audio formats. You may choose any of these formats to 
analyze.  Lots  of  text  speeches  are  available  at  the  websites 
listed  in  the  “Links”  in  the  Related  Resources  section.
You  are  also  encouraged  to  seek  out  video  or  audio 
speeches  and  to  consider  the  appearance  and  sound  of  the 
speaker.  Please  make  sure  that  your  essay  indicates  just  what 
object  you  are  analyzing,  and  provides  adequate  citation 
information  for  your  reader  to  find  the  same  object.  You  may 
include  the  complete  text  of  the  speech  or  other  object  you 
choose  to  analyze  as  an  attachment  with  your  draft,  but 
nevertheless you should not assume that your reader has the text 
in front of her. 
There is no length requirement for this essay, but I imagine an 
effective rhetorical analysis as being around five pages. For 
details of formatting, please refer to the syllabus section. 

•  Your essay’s ideal audience member is a thoughtful, 
educated person, familiar with the candidates and the 
campaign, but not familiar with your particular object of 
analysis. As such, part of your job is to provide summary, 
description, or quotations where appropriate, so your 
reader can see what you are analyzing and check your claims 
against her own intuitions. 
•  Your purpose is to offer an original and engaging insight 
into the rhetorical dimension of your object of analysis. 
While argument is not the main mode of this essay, a claim 
that is wholly obvious will not carry adequate motive to 
ensure the relevance and interest of your essay. This 
primary purpose or central insight suggests three secondary 
purposes: to demonstrate something original about the 
nature of rhetoric, to show how this candidate or campaign 
employs rhetoric, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
rhetoric in promoting the desired message. 
•  Features of successful essays include 
o  A clearly stated and provocative insight into your 
object of analysis, 
o  A thesis or problem that guides and motivates the 
entire essay, 
o  Organized and flowing paragraphs that dig 
progressively deeper into the central insight and the 
rhetoric under analysis, 
o  Appeals to sound logic, critical intuition, and 
defensible judgment, 
o  Original and insightful commentary that defends your 
position while respecting its complexity, 
o  Informative and fair summary or other means of 
presentation of the object of analysis, well 
integrated into the essay’s flow, 
o  Careful selection of specific moments or elements of 
your object of analysis, such that you make an 
effective case for your central insight without 
deliberately ignoring or eliding aspects of the text 
under study, 
o  And clear, concise, accurate, correct prose with some 
memorable phrasings. 
•  Features of unsuccessful essays include 
o  Unclear, inaccurate, wordy, and/or incorrect prose, 
o  Dogmatic claims that are not critically examined, 
o  A central insight that is not especially insightful, 
o  Arguments that may be logical but that do not seem 
intuitively plausible or ethically conscionable, 

o  Choppy, haphazard organization, no organization, or 
paragraphs that constitute a list of claims without a 
sense of progression, 
o  An essay that could be written for a high school class 
in terms of sophistication of thought or language. 
This essay will be submitted twice, first as a draft then as a 
revision. The draft is due in class on Thursday, March 10. The 
revision is due one week later, in class on Thursday, March 17. 
In both cases, please submit an additional copy as an attachment 
by e-mail on the due date. While the revision will determine the 
bulk of the grade for this assignment, the draft should be no 
less a submissible document. Both draft and revision should be 
properly formatted, free from typos and from grammatical and 
spelling errors, thorough, and complete. In short, edit. 
 
Important Note: The feedback on this draft will come primarily 
from your peers. On Thursday, March 10, please bring three 
copies of your draft to class, one for me, and two for peer 
editing. We will spend the day in class doing these peer edits. 
On Friday, March 11, you will send me an e-mail briefly 
outlining your plans for revising the essay.
