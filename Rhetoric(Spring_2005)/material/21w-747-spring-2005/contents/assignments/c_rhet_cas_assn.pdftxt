C1:  “Persuasion  in  Action.”  Bring  in  some  example  of  an 
attempt  at  persuasion,  i.e.,  an  example  of  rhetoric  in 
everyday  life.  It  could  be  an  advertisement,  a  speech, 
something  a  friend  said,  a  newspaper  article,  part  of  a 
lecture,  an  image,  etc.  What  distinguishes  this  attempt  to 
persuade  from  other  objects  that  share  the  same  medium? 
(For  example,  what  makes  this  image/text  persuasive  while 
some  other  images/texts  serve  a  non-persuasive  end?)  How 
does  it  go  about  its  attempt  at  persuasion?  To  what  extent 
does  it  succeed?  What  difference  does  its  medium  make?  Does 
it  exert  some  influence  or  have  some  effect  that  is  not  a 
matter  of  persuasion?  The  idea  is  not  to  answer  each  of 
these  questions,  but  to  approach  your  example  critically, 
to  have  thought  about  what  it  means  that  this  thing  is 
(trying  to  be)  a  persuasive  thing.  Be  prepared  to  present 
your  example  and  analysis  of  it  to  the  class,  given  about 
two minutes. 
 
C2:  The  Phaedrus.  You  have  been  divided  into  groups  of  (at 
least)  three.  Each  group  is  responsible  for  answering  all 
of  the  following  questions.  Your  answers  will  form  the 
basis  for  discussion  in  Tuesday’s  class.  Though  you  can 
certainly  divide  the  questions  among  the  individuals  in 
your  group,  you  should  discuss  these  answers  as  a  group 
before  class,  so  that  any  of  you  is  prepared  to  answer  any 
of the questions. The written response to each of the three 
sections  should  be  about  two  paragraphs,  no  more  than  one 
double-spaced page. 
 
1. Plato  writes  in  this  peculiar  form,  a  dialog  with  more 
than  one  character.  What  impact  does  this  have  on  the 
strength  of  his  arguments  and  what  impact  on  the 
nature of his project? 
2. Plato  writes  three  speeches  on  love.  What  is  the  point 
of  having  three  speeches,  what  lesson  do  we  learn  from 
this  multiplicity  of  speeches?  In  the  speech  Plato 
seems  most  committed  to,  Socrates  outlines  a  theory 
about  how  souls  are  like  horses  and  riders,  galloping 
around  the  universe.  Does  this  image  have  any  power 
over us modern readers? Why or why not? 
3. Plato  argues  that  the  ultimate  rhetoric  is  that 
rhetoric  inscribed  on  the  soul  of  a  man.  What  does 
this mean, and do you buy it? 
 
Finally,  each  group  should  find  one  argument  in  Plato’s 
dialog  that  seems  effective  and  one  that  does  not  seem 

effective.  Be  prepared  to  offer  these  examples  in  class  and 
discuss why they were or were not effective arguments. 
 
C3:  For  those  not  participating  in  the  debate,  write  a 
single  paragraph  on  the  D1  debate  topic,  offering  a  sketch 
of one argument you find most persuasive for either side of 
the debate. 
 
C4:  Proposal  for  A3.  Please  write  a  proposal  outlining  your 
plans  for  the  essay,  A3.  The  proposal  should  be  no  more 
than  one  double-spaced  page,  about  two  medium-length 
paragraphs.  Your  proposal  should  specify  which  technology 
you plan to look at and where you will find the examples of 
rhetoric  relating  to  that  technology.  You  should  also 
indicate  at  least  broadly  what  your  thesis  might  be  or  why 
you  think  this  will  be  a  good  choice  of  technology.  Please 
email to me your proposal by Saturday, November 6, at noon.
