S1: Stump Speech 
 
Prepare and deliver a speech, no more than four minutes 
long, in which you attempt to influence your audience’s 
behavior at the voting booth. This could mean a number of 
different things, and you are free to choose among them. 
Most straightforwardly, you might urge your audience to 
vote for a particular candidate or party. If you choose, 
you can deliver the speech as though you are the candidate 
in question, or a close associate, or you can just be you. 
Instead of trying to earn votes for a candidate, you could 
argue for the importance of a particular issue, urging 
conclusions about how that issue should influence voting. 
At bottom, the idea is to exert an influence over the 
voters, to push people to vote in a particular direction. 
 
Research: Though this assignment does not require research, 
it is often persuasive to bring facts to bear in your case. 
In their stump speeches, candidates running for president 
frequently cite statistics or give concrete examples both 
to evince their claims and to augment the impact of their 
words with vivid stories or heart-rending anecdotes. If 
such evidence would help to give your speech additional 
power, make sure to do the necessary research, which 
probably won’t be much. Do not offer vague assertions with 
the proviso that “everyone knows” that this is the case. 
Assume you are speaking to an audience of intelligent 
skeptics, who will not choose to agree unless you give them 
compelling reasons. At the same time, be careful to help 
your audience to see the big picture, rather than getting 
lost in lots of interesting but “small” details. 
 
Criteria: You will be judged on both the form and content 
of your speech. Formal elements include your pace, tone of 
voice, gestures, eye contact, stance, fluidity, and your 
general charisma or bearing. Your speech should be dynamic 
and spirited, with a sense of conviction, expertise, and 
affability. (You will not be judged on the quality of your 
attire, so feel free to wear what you would wear to class 
any other day. On the other hand, the t-shirt with mold 
growing under the armpits can’t help but give a certain 
impression.) Elements of content include the quality and 
originality of your ideas, the structure of your speech, 
your sensitivity to your audience, your choice of words and 
sentence structures, your use of compelling imagery, 
examples, and rhetorical tropes, and the cumulative force 
of your argument. Bear in mind that while images, 

analogies, anaphora, litotes, alliteration, and other 
rhetorical techniques can greatly enhance the power of a 
speech, these techniques must be appropriate to the context 
rather than contrived. You are often better off saying 
something in the most straightforward way possible, rather 
than risking the confusion of a metaphor that doesn’t quite 
work. 
 
Format: Speeches will probably be spread out over two days 
of class, Tuesday, March 1, and Thursday, March 3. All 
speeches should be prepared for Tuesday, as speakers will 
be chosen at random on that day. We have lots of speeches 
to get through, so please be ready when your name is 
called. After your four-minute presentation, there will be 
sometime for brief questions from the audience to which you 
are expected to respond intelligently and compellingly. 
Following the question-and-answer session, we will critique 
your speech as a group. Throughout your presentation, 
including the question period, you are advised to maintain 
a professional demeanor, though this does not mean that you 
must be formal or stiff. The point is to take your role 
seriously, to believe for those few minutes that you have 
the opportunity to exert an influence over a significant 
audience of voters. 
 
Presentation: You can read, speak from notes, or deliver 
your talk from memory, but know that the most effective 
speeches have at least the appearance of a certain 
spontaneity. A speaker who reads verbatim from a sheet of 
paper invites doubt as to her sincerity. Whatever method 
you choose, you would be well advised to practice, probably 
a few times, to avoid stumbling during your presentation. 
 
S2: Micropolitics 
 
Prepare and deliver a speech, no more than four minutes 
long, in which you present the micropolitical dimension of 
an object or phenomenon that is not normally thought of as 
political. In terms of content, the speech should have 
three things: (1) a vivid and intriguing description of the 
object, (2) a detailed analysis of the political dimension 
of that object, and (3) a persuasive argument about how we 
should behave with respect to that object, given its 
political aspect. 
 
Research: This is not primarily a research assignment. 
Though you may want to do some research to be able to 

indicate connections between your mundane object and the 
larger world, or to be able to cite surprising and little 
known facts about your object (or phenomenon), these will 
not be the focus of your speech. Rather, your speech will 
show that you have thought a lot about your chosen object, 
discovered aspects of it that your audience will not have 
thought of before. 
 
Criteria: The criteria are pretty much the same as in S1. 
You will be judged on both the form and content of your 
speech. In general, content will be weighted more heavily 
than form, though both are significant factors. Formal 
elements include your pace, tone of voice, gestures, eye 
contact, stance, fluidity, and your general charisma or 
bearing. (You will not be judged on the quality of your 
attire, so feel free to wear what you would wear to class 
any other day. On the other hand, the t-shirt with mold 
growing under the armpits can’t help but give a certain 
impression.) Elements of content include the quality and 
originality of your ideas, the structure of your speech, 
your sensitivity to your audience, your choice of words and 
sentence structures, your use of compelling imagery, 
examples, and rhetorical tropes, and the cumulative force 
of your insight. Bear in mind that while images, analogies, 
anaphora, litotes, alliteration, and other rhetorical 
techniques can greatly enhance the power of a speech, these 
techniques must be appropriate to the context rather than 
contrived. You are usually better off saying something in 
the most straightforward way possible, rather than risking 
the confusion of a metaphor that doesn’t quite work. 
 
Format: Speeches will take place over two days of class, 
October 26 and 28, with order to be determined randomly. 
Once again, there will be a couple of minutes after each 
speech for questions, during which I will have an 
opportunity to complete my notes. 
 
Presentation: This time, please do not read, though you may 
use notes. Also, please practice prior to your speech, not 
only to make it go more smoothly, but also so that you can 
be more certain of remaining within the allotted time frame 
of four minutes. 
 
The bottom line here is to help your audience understand 
the way in which their actions and choices in the world 
really matter. The hard part of this speech is to make a 
genuine connection between the ordinary and the political. 

Note: to call something political is not necessarily to 
connect it to the government or the election process. 
Rather, a political dimension of an object is a way in 
which it takes on a value above its mundane role in our 
lives. 
 
S3: Open Topic Persuasive Speech 
Prepare and deliver an extemporaneous speech, no more than 
eight minutes long, on a topic of your choosing. The only 
stipulation regarding content is that it must be a 
persuasive speech, an attempt to influence the convictions 
of your audience. 
 
Content/Criteria: The choice of topic is open. Though your 
speech must have real substance, thoughtful argument, and a 
genuine attempt at persuasion, the topic might still be 
humorous, hypothetical, or narrow. You need not be grave 
nor must your topic be severe. Without restricting your 
choice of topic, the nature of the assignment does suggest 
a number of guidelines. Your topic should be appropriate to 
the audience. Your topic should allow a thorough engagement 
within the time limit. Your topic should be motivated, 
which is to say, it should concern an issue that has or 
should have a value to your audience. As in a good essay, 
your speech should make an original and contentious claim, 
which it supports through critical, thoughtful analysis and 
appropriate use of evidence. Good speeches will generally 
have an introduction that clarifies the topic and 
establishes a common ground with the audience, as well as a 
conclusion that not only reiterates, summarizes, and 
closes, but also points onward toward farther reaching 
conclusions. Effective speeches tend to refer in the body 
of the argument to the central point; don’t forget to speak 
to your audience, keeping in mind that we are not as well 
versed in the details of your analysis as are you. These 
guidelines may not help you to figure out what to speak 
about. If you want additional assistance, please ask the 
instructor. 
 
Grading: As usual, your speech will be graded primarily 
based on its content. Presentation is crucially important, 
and you will be rewarded for an effective use of rhetorical 
techniques, good intonation, pacing, body language, and 
other formal aspects of your delivery. But clever wording 
or entertaining antics cannot substitute for having 
something to say, and the content of your persuasive speech 
is paramount in the determination of your grade. 

 
Format: The speech should be no longer than eight minutes. 
Please respect this time limit, as we must ensure that 
every student gets a chance to deliver her speech before 
the end of term. When the speech is over, there will be a 
short question period, approximately three minutes. This 
speech is extemporaneous, which means you are not allowed 
to read the speech verbatim. You may read, if you choose 
to, the introduction and conclusion of your speech. But the 
body of the speech should be delivered from memory or from 
note cards or an outline. You will be penalized 
significantly if you read your whole speech. Note cards or 
outline will be submitted at the end of the speech. 
 
Audience: Your audience for this speech comprises your 
classmates and the instructor. Choose your topic and 
present your ideas accordingly.
