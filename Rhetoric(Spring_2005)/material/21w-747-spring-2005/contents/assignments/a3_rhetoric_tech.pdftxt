Rhetoric, Assignment A3, Rhetoric of Technology 
 
Write  an  essay  in  which  you  analyze  the  meaning  of  some 
technology,  looking  especially  at  the  rhetoric  surrounding  that 
technology.  Choose  some  technology  (current,  future,  or 
archaic), find a number of examples of rhetoric relating to that 
technology,  and  produce  an  essay  in  which  you  discover  the 
meanings of that technology in the rhetoric surrounding it. 
 
The challenge of this essay, as usual, will be finding something 
worth  saying  about  the  rhetoric  of  your  chosen  technology, 
something  to  tie  together  all  of  your  interesting  analysis  into 
a  motivated  essay.  While  you  may  have  something  in  mind  at  the 
start  of  your  writing  process,  it  is  often  a  good  idea  to  allow 
yourself to write freely about your topic, generating ideas in a 
forum  unconstrained  by  a  preconception  of  a  thesis.  Then,  take 
the  most  interesting  few  ideas  at  which  you  arrive,  and  weave 
them together into a consistently probing, progressive essay. 
 
The  exemplar  in  this  assignment  is  George  Myerson’s  monograph, 
Heidegger,  Habermas,  and  the  Mobile  Phone.  You  may  wish  to  look 
back  at  some  of  Myerson’s  arguments  and  strategies,  and  adapt 
them  for  your  own  analysis.  In  particular,  you  would  do  well  to 
emulate  Myerson’s  approach  to  the  rhetoric  of  the  mobile  phone 
as a symptom of cultural attitudes. 
 
Research:  This  assignment  requires  at  least  some  research,  to 
find examples of the rhetoric of your chosen technology. You are 
also  encouraged  to  consult  secondary  sources  that  analyze  your 
chosen  technology  or  its  rhetoric,  and  to  make  use  of  these 
sources  (with  appropriate  citations,  of  course)  in  your  essay. 
However,  “secondary”  research  is  not  essential.  Though  you  may 
end  up  wanting  to  do  a  fair  amount  of  research,  be  certain  that 
your  essay  is  mostly  a  presentation  of  your  own  original 
analysis  and  ideas.  This  is  not  a  “research”  essay,  and  should 
not  be  a  summary  of  or  list  of  the  discoveries  you  make  as  you 
research your topic. 
There is no length requirement for this essay, but I imagine 
that it will take around five to seven pages to treat the 
rhetoric of a technology in adequate detail. For rules of 
formatting, please refer to the syllabus section. 
•  Your essay’s ideal audience member is a thoughtful, 
educated person, familiar with though not expert in current 
technologies. If you are analyzing an obscure technology, 

you should spend some words explaining it to readers who 
might be unfamiliar with it. 
•  Your purpose is to offer an original and engaging insight 
into the rhetoric surrounding a technology. It may be of 
particular interest to contrast the rhetoric of the 
technology with the actual effects of the technology, and 
this could constitute an excellent essay. Or it may turn 
out that the technology lives up to its rhetoric. In either 
case, your analysis should engage substantially with 
rhetoric, with the way that the technology is represented 
in advertising, technical papers, popular stories, 
journalism, etc. 
•  Features of successful essays include 
o  A clearly stated and provocative insight into your 
object of analysis, a thesis or problem that guides 
and motivates the entire essay, 
o  Organized and flowing paragraphs that dig 
progressively deeper into the central insight and the 
rhetoric under analysis, 
o  Appeals to sound logic, critical intuition, and 
defensible judgment, 
o  Original, engaging commentary that defends your 
position while respecting its complexity, 
o  Informative and fair summary or other means of 
presentation of the object of analysis, well 
integrated into the essay’s flow, 
o  Careful selection of specific moments or elements of 
your object of analysis, such that you make an 
effective case for your central insight without 
deliberately ignoring or eliding aspects of the text 
under study, 
o  And clear, concise, accurate, correct prose with some 
memorable phrasings. 
•  Features of unsuccessful essays include 
o  Unclear, inaccurate, wordy, and/or incorrect prose, 
o  Dogmatic claims that are not critically examined, 
o  A central insight that is not especially insightful, 
o  Arguments that may be logical but that do not seem 
intuitively plausible or ethically conscionable, 
o  Choppy, haphazard organization, no organization, or 
paragraphs that constitute a list of claims without a 
sense of progression, 
o  An essay that could be written for a high school class 
in terms of sophistication of thought or language. 
This essay will be submitted twice, first as a draft then as a 
revision. The draft is due in my office at 10am on Friday, 

November 12, the day after Veteran’s Day. The revision is due in 
class on Thursday, December 2. In both cases, please submit an 
additional copy as an attachment by e-mail on the due date. 
While the revision will determine the bulk of the grade for this 
assignment, the draft should be no less a submissible document. 
Both draft and revision should be properly formatted, free from 
typos and from grammatical and spelling errors, thorough, and 
complete. In short, edit. 
 
Conferences: In between draft and revision, there will a 
mandatory one-on-one conference between each student and the 
professor to discuss the revision process. Conferences will take 
place on Thursday, November 18, and possibly the following 
Friday and Monday. Sign up for conference times in class.
