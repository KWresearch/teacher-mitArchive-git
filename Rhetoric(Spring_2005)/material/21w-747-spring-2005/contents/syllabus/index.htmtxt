***** Course Description *****
This course uses the study of rhetoric as an opportunity to offer instruction
in critical thinking. Through extensive writing and speaking assignments,
students will develop their abilities to analyze texts of all kinds and to
generate original and incisive ideas of their own. Critical thinking and
original analysis as expressed in writing and in speech are the paramount goals
of this class. The course will thus divide its efforts between an examination
of the subject matter and an examination of student writing and speaking, in
order to encourage in both instances the principal aims of the course.
Rhetoric, broadly understood, provides a framework for achieving these goals.
Rhetoric is traditionally conceived as the art of persuasive language, and this
course will in part study how spoken and written language becomes compelling.
Critically examined arguments are generally more potent than unexamined ones,
so the emphasis on critical thinking will also improve the student's ability to
formulate powerful arguments.
But rhetoric-which had for some years foundered as an intellectual and academic
discipline-has taken on a broader set of meanings in its recent rebirth. No
longer is rhetoric confined to the use of language, for it now admits
representations of all kinds, beyond the linguistic, to include images, sounds,
logos, architecture, and more. Though these forms are in some sense persuasive,
they do not necessarily attempt to convince an audience of the correctness of a
proposition; instead, they compel or provoke their witnesses without demanding
a consensus of opinion or feeling. This class will investigate these and other
media, noting the effects they engender, subtle and pervasive, on our lives and
our habits of thinking.
**** Content ****
The semester will begin with a brief introduction to the classical discipline
of rhetoric, including a look at one of Plato's dialogs on the subject. We will
next consider rhetoric in its quintessentially modern mode, as a tool of
politicians and salespeople. But the influence of rhetoric is not confined to
these most explicit and recognizable contexts, so we will also study the
rhetorical dimensions of everyday objects and behaviors that we usually take
for granted. Taking our cue from this investigation of "micropolitics," we will
end the semester by looking at the rhetoric of technology and the ways in which
technology shapes our rhetoric. Note that throughout the semester, the course
will have an explicitly political content, and will engage substantially with
philosophy as well.
**** Activities ****
As the subject of rhetoric offers a unique opportunity in the humanities to
combine theory and practice, we will take advantage of this opportunity,
practicing rhetoric throughout the semester in writing and speaking. Student
presentations will occupy much of our class time, and peer analysis of student
writing will be a frequent exercise. In-class debates will allow us to practice
both critical skills and persuasive ones. In addition to the major writing
assignments, short assignments throughout the semester will rehearse elements
of the writing process and help students prepare for class discussion. Needless
to say, student attendance and participation are utterly crucial for a
successful and effective rhetoric class.
***** Grading *****
Bear in mind that drafts of writing assignments figure in to some extent as
part of the grade for that assignment. Casual assignments constitute part of
the Participation grade. Your grade will be determined as follows.
          Grading
ACTIVITIES            PARTS
Writing Assignment 1  4
Writing Assignment 2  4
Writing Assignment 3  6
Speaking Assignment 1 2
Speaking Assignment 2 1
Speaking Assignment 3 4
In-class Debate       4
Participation         6
Total                 31

In general, the highest grades will be earned by those students who present
extremely original, highly critical ideas in distinct and lucid prose, taking
care to avoid sloppy or lazy formatting, spelling, etc. In past semesters, 20
points has counted as a passing grade, while 24 points equated to a B grade.
***** Course Details *****
**** Your Role in this Class ****
This course requires your attendance and on-time production. You are expected
to be prepared for each class (having read and thought about the assigned
reading, having assignments completed) and to participate meaningfully and
often in class discussions and workshops.
**** Responsibility as Student ****
This class is to some extent unusual in the humanities in that, in keeping with
the subject matter, one of our primary modes is practice. Perhaps this will
feel familiar to you scientists and engineers, since your laboratory work is
similarly a practical application of theory you may have studied in lecture
contexts. But this class remains unique in that the practice is not just an
application of the theory, but is a demonstration, articulation, or elaboration
of the theory. We do rhetoric about rhetoric. As such, your contributions will
serve to substantiate the class, so that this class will likely be only as
effective as the students are able to make it. There are frequent speaking
assignments, as well as numerous writing assignments, which ensures, if all
goes well, that your voices will be heard much more than the professor's.
Though this course will have some reading, the texts are not our primary focus.
Instead, you will be responsible for providing material for discussion,
including your own written work, prepared and impromptu presentations, and
examples of material brought in from "the real world."
**** Attendance ****
I do not distinguish between excused and unexcused absences. Given the "hands-
on" nature of the subject matter, to miss class is necessarily to miss out on
the learning that this class provides.
    * There are two penalty-free absences that you should save for illness,
      religious reasons, job interviews, and the like. These absences are, for
      all practical purposes, "no questions asked," so that you need present no
      excuse for missing class. Note: In the last two weeks of class (the final
      four meetings), the "no questions asked" policy is suspended; missed
      classes during these last two weeks require a medical excuse and a
      doctor's note in order to count as a penalty-free absence.
    * The third absence is no longer penalty free: it lowers your final course
      grade by a whole grade (e.g., an A becomes a B), the fourth lowers it
      another whole grade (the original A becomes a C).
    * The fifth absence means automatic failure for the course; you should drop
      the course immediately to avoid its showing up on your transcript. This
      automatic failure occurs regardless of your average or the reason for the
      absences because you will not have fulfilled the course requirements - no
      exceptions.
    * You must be on time for class.Â  If other classes or labs will
      necessitate your arriving late or leaving early, do not take this class
      this semester. Being more than 10 minutes late or having to leave class
      early will count as an absence.
    * If you are absent on a day when you were responsible for part of class
      time (for example, you were giving a presentation or participating in a
      debate), you will likely receive a 0 for that assignment. This is
      unfortunate, but the busy schedules of your classmates do not allow for
      much post hoc shuffling.
**** Manuscript Formats ****
All major writing assignments are submitted as hardcopies, following the
formatting requirements outlined below. Major writing assignments are also to
be submitted by e-mail, as an attachment, due at the same time as the hardcopy
(or just after). Minor assignments, when they are submitted, will be submitted
sometimes as hardcopy, sometimes electronically, and sometimes both.
Essay manuscripts should be typewritten and double-spaced. Drafts can be
submitted on two sides of the page, but the final revision must be submitted
single-sided. Single-space your name, the course title, my name, and the number
of the essay (or draft, e.g., "A2D") in the upper right-hand corner of the
first page. Center your title about a third of the way down your first page,
and begin your opening paragraph two double spaces beneath your title. Please
do not underline your title or place it in quotation marks (except in special
cases, such as a title that is a quotation). Number your pages, beginning on
page two. You should use a twelve-point font, and margins of about an inch all
the way around.
Electronic manuscripts should be duplicates of the hardcopy. Please submit
electronic manuscripts as an attachment with the assignment number ("Draft 2"
or "Revision 2") and your name in the subject line. (This last stipulation may
seem unnecessary, since your name will also be in the "From" field of the e-
mail, but it helps immensely with clerical issues at my end.)
All drafts and revisions must be word-processed and thoroughly proofread for
typographical, grammatical, and punctuation errors. If you consistently make
these kinds of errors, your grade will drop.
You are required to keep a copy, electronic or otherwise, of every assignment.
You are strongly encouraged to save your document frequently, back-up
regularly, and print your work-in-progress periodically. Computer errors are
inevitable and do not excuse shoddy, incomplete, or late work.
**** Workshops ****
Workshops allow you to help each other improve your current draft. They
demonstrate the way in which writing is social, part of an ongoing community
dialogue, and subject to change based on the responses of particular readers.
As a responder to someone else's essay, don't waste time correcting grammar,
spelling, or formatting; instead, focus on the ideas, pointing out places where
ideas need to be developed more fully or need more support. As the writer, ask
specific questions about your content and organization.Â The professor will
provide additional details about workshop responsibilities when the workshop is
upon us.
**** Conferences ****
Each student must meet at least once with the professor during the semester to
discuss the process of moving from a draft to a revision. More details of this
meeting will be furnished when the time comes, but, in brief, it is the
student's responsibility to set an agenda for this meeting.
**** Late Work ****
Oral presentations and speeches will receive a 0 if not given on time. Written
work that is late reduces your final course grade by 1/3 (e.g., a B- for the
course becomes a C+) for each class day that a paper is late. Work submitted
late may receive no written commentary. Nevertheless, you are urged to submit
all written assignments, even late ones, as non-submission has more severe
consequences than does late submission. Note that some work is due not in class
but on a day when class does not meet. These submissions are due at my office
at the specified time. If I am not in my office at that time, please leave your
submission in the "inbox" attached to the door of my office.
***** Writing Center *****
You are encouraged to consult the Writing Center at any stage of your writing
process. They will also be happy to help you with speaking assignments. This is
an invaluable resource so take advantage of it. Note that the Writing Center
tends to get crowded at certain times during the semester, so it is best to
schedule an appointment at least five days in advance if possible. SeeÂ MIT's
online_Writing_and_Communication_Center.
***** Plagiarism *****
Plagiarism (e.g., copying and pasting sections from the web, paying for
someone's paper, handing in someone else's paper as your own) results in
academic disaster. So it's crucial to understand the concept.
    * Just as scientists demand complete and accurate information about
      experiments so they can duplicate and check those experiments and just as
      math professors demand complete and accurate work to show how you got the
      answer, so scholars and readers demand complete information so they can
      explore in more depth what your sources said (and, frankly, so they can
      check your accuracy in reporting what those sources said). In all
      academic writing, then, you must give citations each time you use:
          o someone else's ideas
          o someone else's words
          o someone else's phrasing
          o someone else's argument structure
          o someone else's unusual information
    * The bottom line is to give credit wherever it is due. When in doubt,
      cite.
    * Further, you show appropriate respect for other writers and thinkers by
      giving them credit for their ideas, their structures, their phrasings,
      and their information. In Western culture, not giving credit is an insult
      as well as an act of dishonesty.
    * In other words, never take credit for someone else's words, ideas, or
      style (this prohibition includes material found on the Web).
          o Remember, although the material on the Web is free, you did not
            create it; someone else thought it, researched it, wrote it, and
            that someone must be given credit.
    * There are four guidelines for using sources in your academic writing:
          o Unless a professor explicitly requests a paraphrase or unless you
            are translating a sophisticated technical source into language for
            the layperson, there is rarely a good reason to paraphrase a
            source-either summarize it in your own words or quote it exactly.
          o When you quote, quote exactly, use quotation marks, and cite the
            source.
          o When you use information that might not be considered common
            knowledge, cite the source.
          o When in doubt, always give a citation.
    * In sum, your essays should always be your own work (although you are
      encouraged to seek writing advice from the Writing Center and from your
      workshop groups). Your essays should always be your new work created
      specifically for this course. Do not hand in work written for other
      courses-neither from this semester nor from previous semesters, and this
      prohibition includes modifying or adapting your own work from other
      courses-doing so will result in an unchangeable zero.
    * If I so request, you must hand in hard copies of all the sources that you
      used for writing an essay, as well as your notes and rough drafts. If you
      cannot produce these materials when requested, the essay will receive a
      zero and will not be allowed to be replaced by another essay. Further,
      you may receive a failing grade for the class. Also, you are responsible
      for ensuring that others do not copy your work or submit it as their own.
