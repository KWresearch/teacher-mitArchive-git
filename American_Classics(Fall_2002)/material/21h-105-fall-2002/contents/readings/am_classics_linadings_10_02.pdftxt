Selections for Readings by Abraham Lincoln 

The selections here are based on Abraham Lincoln, Selected Speeches and Writings (Vintage, 
1992), but should be widely available in other collected editions of Lincoln’s works. You may 
find it useful, for background, to read a biographical entry on Abraham Lincoln in a major 
reference work like the Dictionary of American Biography or American National Biography, 
both in the reference section of the Humanities Library. There is a limitless amount of 
information about Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War on line. One useful starting points is the 
website of the Abraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress 
(http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/alhtml/malhome.html). The most interesting website on the 
history of the Civil War is the Valley of the Shadow Project at the University of Virginia 
(http://www.iath.virginia.edu/vshadow2/), which presents material on two communities (one 
Northern, one Southern) in the Civil War era.
