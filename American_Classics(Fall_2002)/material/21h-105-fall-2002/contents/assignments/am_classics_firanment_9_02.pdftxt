First Writing Assignment 

This assignment gives you a chance to examine The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin in 
greater depth. It is also a chance for you to work together with your colleagues on developing 
written arguments in the most effective way possible. In this assignment, participation in the pre-
writing and group editing activities is just as important as the final product itself. 

What to Do for Class #5. 

Consider the following three questions. 

1. In what sense is Benjamin Franklin a “self-made man”? Does the Autobiography help him 
achieve his goal of “arriving at moral Perfection”? Or, by contrast, did Franklin undermine this 
goal when he wrote the Autobiography? 

2. In “The Way to Wealth,” Benjamin Franklin urges his readers to “Be industrious and free; be 
frugal and free,” and throughout the Autobiography, Franklin is concerned with achieving a 
sense of freedom. By contrast, in Studies in Classic American Literature (1923), the modernist 
writer D.H. Lawrence disparages Benjamin Franklin as a “virtuous little automaton” who was a 
slave to his own vision of self-mastery and moral perfection. With whom do you agree? Is 
Benjamin Franklin free, or not? 

3. Choose a portrait by John Singleton Copley, either one that we have viewed in class, one that 
you identify through research, or one that you view in person at the Museum of Fine Arts or the 
Fogg Art Museum. How do the portrait and the Autobiography express similar or different 
understandings of the self in eighteenth-century America? You may focus on any aspect of the 
self that you wish, but you should draw on specific passages of the Autobiography and talk 
specifically about the paintings. (Please note: If you want to do research on the web for this 
question, be sure to find a high-quality reproduction. Also, your images must be from the website 
of the collection that owns the original painting. For example, a discussion of the painting Epes 
Sargent (1760) must use the website of the National Gallery of Art in Washington.) 

You do not have to write a finished paper for class #5. You do not even have to write a complete 
rough draft. What you should do is choose two of the three questions, and for each one, write 
the first paragraph of what would be an essay, and then, in outline form, give examples or quotes 
that support the argument that you have laid out in the first paragraph. 

That’s it. Make sure you bring two copies of both paragraphs with you. We will be working in 
class #5, on peer editing and workshop activities. The aim of these activities is to help you 
figure out which essay topic you are most interested in and which you can most successfully 
write.

What to Do for Class #6. 

On Class #6, you should hand in a finished essay of 3 to 5 pages on one of the questions that 
you drafted a response to during the first week. 

Whatever you do, be clear in your view on the theme you choose, state it clearly in the opening 
paragraph, and use direct quotations from the original works to demonstrate your points. The 
paper should be double-spaced with standard margins. As with all assignments, extensions will 
be granted only for good reasons explained well in advance; computer malfunctions are never an 
acceptable excuse for a late submission. Proper academic citation is required, but you may use 
whichever standard style you prefer.
