FINAL PAPER ASSIGNMENT:  

American Freedom in the Twentieth Century  


During the twentieth century, the concept of freedom was a keyword of American culture, a word that 
everyone agreed was important even if they didn’t agree what it meant. The concept emerged as what 
cultural historians call a “contested terrain” of meaning that people fought over as a way of figuring out 
the meaning of America itself. We will encounter many examples some examples in class, but there are 
many others: 

Norman Rockwell put the concept into his “Four Freedoms” posters during World War II after hearing 
Franklin D. Roosevelt use it in his Third Inaugural Address 
(http://www.nara.gov/exhall/powers/freedoms.html). During the Cold War, the concept of freedom was 
central to American life at home and abroad, in documents like the National Security Council’s NSC-68 
(http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68.htm), which articulated American aims in the conflict with 
the Soviet Union. Freedom was also a theme in the songs of the Civil Rights Movement and in Martin 
Luther King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” and it was also in the writings of beat poets like Allen 
Ginsberg (http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/ginsberg/onlinepoems.htm). During the 
tumultuous 1960s, it could be found nearly everywhere, from the Port Huron Statement of the radical 
1960s group Students for a Democratic Society 
(http://lists.village.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Primary/Manifestos/SDS_Port_Huron.htm 
l), to the manifesto of the conservative pro-Vietnam-War youth movement Young Americans for 
Freedom (http://www.yaf.com/sharon.shtml). 

In eight to ten pages, explore the meaning of freedom in American politics and culture during the 
twentieth century through a close analysis of a document or small set of documents. Your essay should 
explore the meaning of freedom to the individual(s) or group(s) that you are examining, and use that to 
develop a broader interpretive argument about American culture in this period. Be sure to elaborate on the 
broader significance of your document for America’s ongoing debate about freedom and national identity 
that has been the central theme of this class. 

This is a research paper that requires you to base your argument on material not currently on the syllabus. 
The examples I give above only scratch the surface – there is almost no limit to the range of topics that 
could be explored. Be sure, however, that your paper is based on an interpretation of original material 
produced during these years in which freedom is a central organizing concept. A poem about freedom 
works just fine. Your rambling thoughts about how driving a ‘57 Chevy makes you feel free is not. (If 
you have your heart set on writing about a topic on an earlier time period in American history, let me 
know, and we can work something out. The twentieth century, as you will soon find, is easier to research, 
but there is plenty of material on other topics.) 

This is not the kind of paper that you can write in one night, and so the requirements for the paper are set 
up to prevent you from trying to do that. On class #22, we will have a discussion in class on issues of 
writing and conceptualization to get you to start thinking about your topic if you haven’t already done so. 
If you come up with ideas for the topic after class #23, you may want to email me about them or come to 
office hours. This is also the time to do background research about your topic. Leave time for dead-ends 
in your research. 

On class #24, you should hand in a brief description of your paper that describes the primary source 
material that you will use, and the questions that you think it will answer. You don’t have to have a thesis 
statement, an opening paragraph, or an outline, but you might find it useful to draft something like that. 
You should definitely have some sense by now of what your paper will ultimately be about, and whether

the source material you’ve found can help you address those questions. This is required, and counts for 
5% of your final grade. Bring what you write with you to class that day, and we will spend some time 
doing brainstorming. You will turn them in that day and I will respond to them by email. 

The final paper is due in class on class #26. I encourage you to work with a peer editor on a draft during 
the last couple of days. Bring your paper with you and be prepared to talk about it. We will also discuss 
King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” so be sure to set aside time to read that as well. 

What Are Some Kinds of Primary Sources? 
The following are taken in part from a series of essays on “Recovering the Past” in Gary B. Nash, et al., 
The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society (1994). They are meant to suggest the wide range 
of things that historians examine. 

Think about: newspapers, magazines, congressional records, census data, architecture, autobiographies, 
sermons and speeches, military records, paintings, novels, poems,  foreigners’ travel narratives, personal 
diaries, scrapbooks, and letterbooks, maps, public monuments, labor or radical pamphlets, ethnic 
newspapers (especially if you read other languages), photographs, political cartoons, government wartime 
propaganda, advertising, social scientific surveys, court decisions, fashion, and film. 

Tracking Down Materials 
There are a number of collections of primary sources in American history from which you could put 
together a list of sources. The Annals of America series and the Major Problems in ... series are 
particularly good. MIT has a remarkably good collection of magazines and newspapers of the twentieth 
century, some on microfilm and others in the RetroSpective Collection. Use reference works like Poole’s 
Index (for 19th-century magazines) or the Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature (after 1900 or so). If 
you are focusing on a specific person, it would be worth your time to look him/her up in something like 
the Dictionary of American Biography, Who’s Who, or Notable American Women. The Blackwell 
Companion to American Thought is useful for intellectual and cultural trends. Those working in literary 
sources should consult the Dictionary of Literary Biography for the authors they are considering. The 
Grove Dictionary of Art has excellent entries on hundreds of American artists from the period. Other 
works like Darlene Clark Hine, ed., Black Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia, Ronald 
Takaki, Strangers from a Different Shore: A  History of Asian Americans, or Jonathan Katz, Gay 
American History can give a multicultural perspective. A good starting place for any research is The 
Reader’s Companion to American History, edited by Eric Foner and John Garraty. 

Reference Librarians. These folks are very helpful, particularly with such issues as identifying on-line 
sources, working with microfilm and microfiche, or navigating the various article indexes. You can 
always work with the reference librarian at the desk (during hours when it is staffed), but it may be a 
better idea to set up an appointment in advance. 

Extensions. You have plenty of time to plan for the paper in advance; extensions should not be necessary 
except in case of emergency. I have set the paper deadline at the end of the term in order to give you time 
during the exam period to focus on your other classes. Please remember that computer-related crises are 
not valid reasons for an extension; leave yourself a cushion of time in case something breaks or will not 
print. Please be careful to cite the sources of information and ideas that you use in your paper, both 
primary and secondary. You may use any of the standard methods of citation (footnotes, endnotes, 
parenthetical references, etc.), as long as you are complete and consistent.
