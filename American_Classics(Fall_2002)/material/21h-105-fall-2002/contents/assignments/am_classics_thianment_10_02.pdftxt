Third Writing Assignment 

Your finished essay should answer one of these questions in three to five pages. A finished draft of the 
paper is due on class #15. We will do a peer editing session for part of class on class #15. Tuesday and 
you can decide either that you wish to turn the paper in that day or rework it again and turn it in on class # 
16. As always, the essay should have a clear statement of your interpretation of the texts, and use direct 
quotations from the original works to demonstrate your points. The paper should be double-spaced with 
standard margins. As with all assignments, extensions will be granted only for good reasons explained 
well in advance; computer malfunctions are never an acceptable excuse for a late submission. Proper 
academic citation is required, but you may use whichever standard style you prefer. 

1. What is Frederick Douglass’s response to America? Does he reject it or seek inclusion in it? You may 
find it useful to use both the Narrative and the speech “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” (1852), 
or to distinguish between the ideas in the two documents. 

2. Consider the original documents by Abraham Lincoln that you are reading for class this week. Choose 
a particular aspect of Lincoln’s thought or the history of the period as it is illuminated by Lincoln’s own 
writings and speeches. You can choose any theme: political, military, social, religious, even literary. You 
may wish to examine a particular theme or issue – civil liberties, wartime presidential leadership, the 
question of slavery – and use the documents to make a claim. Or you may wish to juxtapose two 
documents that share something in common or seem to contradict each other. Whatever you do, be clear 
in your view on the theme you choose, state it clearly in the opening paragraph, and use direct quotations 
from the original works to demonstrate your points. 

3. For the more creative writers: Construct a dialogue between Frederick Douglass and Benjamin Franklin 
that explores the lives and the autobiographies of each author. (You should assume that each has read the 
other’s autobiography.) The text of the essay could consist of exchanges of direct quotes between the 
authors, or of an imagined dialogue between them. The challenge is to find a way in your constructed 
dialogue to convey an argument that is supported by evidence as thoroughly as any other essay topic. 

4. Finally, if you wish, you may write your own essay question. If you plan to do this, you must submit 
the question to me in writing or email after Class #16. and by the next day I will either give you a go 
ahead, or suggest some modifications in the question. When you turn in the essay, you should write out 
the text of that question at the heading of the essay.
