1
0:00:01 --> 00:00:07
We're going to talk
about a whole new concept,

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:09
which is the concept
of momentum.

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:14
We've all heard the expression,

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
"We have a lot
of momentum going."

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:19
Well, in physics,
momentum is a vector,

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:22
and it is a product
between the mass of a particle

8
00:00:19 --> 00:00:25
and its velocity.

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
And so the units would be

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:30
kilograms times meters
per second.

11
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
F = ma.

12
00:00:30 --> 00:00:36

13
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
That equals m dv/dt.

14
00:00:39 --> 00:00:45
That equals d(mv)/dt

15
00:00:44 --> 00:00:50
and that equals,
therefore, dp/dt.

16
00:00:52 --> 00:00:58
So what you see--
the force is dp/dt,

17
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
and what that means is if a
particle changes its momentum,

18
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
a force must have acted upon it.

19
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
It also means if a force
acts on a particle,

20
00:01:06 --> 00:01:12
it will change its momentum.

21
00:01:08 --> 00:01:14
Let us now envision that we have
a whole set of particles

22
00:01:12 --> 00:01:18
which are interacting
with each other,

23
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
and the interaction could be
gravitational interaction,

24
00:01:18 --> 00:01:24
could be electrical interaction,

25
00:01:20 --> 00:01:26
but they're interacting
with each other.

26
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
Zillions of them--
a whole star cluster.

27
00:01:27 --> 00:01:33
I pick one here,
which I call mi,

28
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
and I pick another here,
which I call mj.

29
00:01:35 --> 00:01:41
And there is an external force
on them,

30
00:01:37 --> 00:01:43
because they happen
to be exposed to forces

31
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
from the outside world,

32
00:01:41 --> 00:01:47
and so on this one
is a force Fi external,

33
00:01:49 --> 00:01:55
and on this one is Fj external.

34
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
But they're interacting
with each other,

35
00:01:58 --> 00:02:04
either attracting or repelling,

36
00:02:01 --> 00:02:07
and so in addition
to these external force,

37
00:02:04 --> 00:02:10
there is a force that j feels
due to the presence of i.

38
00:02:08 --> 00:02:14
And let's suppose
they are attracting each other.

39
00:02:12 --> 00:02:18
This would be F that j
experience in the presence of i.

40
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
Actions equals minus reactions,
according to Newton's Third Law,

41
00:02:22 --> 00:02:28
so this force, Fij, will be
exactly the same as Fji,

42
00:02:26 --> 00:02:32
except in
the opposite direction.

43
00:02:29 --> 00:02:35
We call these internal forces.

44
00:02:32 --> 00:02:38
That's the interaction
between the particles.

45
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
If these were
the only two forces,

46
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
then the net force on this
object, on this particle i,

47
00:02:45 --> 00:02:51
would be... would be a force
in this direction.

48
00:02:49 --> 00:02:55
This would be F net.

49
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
Now, you can do the same here.

50
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
This would be F net
on particle j,

51
00:02:59 --> 00:03:05
and this would be F net
on particle i.

52
00:03:03 --> 00:03:09
But since there are zillions
of objects here,

53
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
there are many of these
interacting forces,

54
00:03:10 --> 00:03:16
and so I can't tell you
what the net force will be.

55
00:03:13 --> 00:03:19
The net force is ultimately
the sum of the external force

56
00:03:17 --> 00:03:23
and all the internal forces.

57
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
What is the total momentum
of these zillions of particles?

58
00:03:25 --> 00:03:31
Well, that's the sum
of the individual momenta.

59
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
So that is p1 plus p2... pi...
and you have to add them all up.

60
00:03:37 --> 00:03:43
I take the derivative of this--
dp total/dt.

61
00:03:45 --> 00:03:51
That is p1/dt.

62
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
Well, that's the force
on number one.

63
00:03:50 --> 00:03:56
It's the total force
on number one.

64
00:03:53 --> 00:03:59
So it is F1, but it is
the net force on F1.

65
00:03:59 --> 00:04:05
And F... and dp/dt for this
particle equals F2 net force,

66
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
and the force on particle number
i equals Fi net, and so on.

67
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
And so when we add up
all these forces,

68
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
obviously that is the total
force on the entire system.

69
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
Now comes the miracle.

70
00:04:24 --> 00:04:30
The miracle is that
all these internal forces

71
00:04:27 --> 00:04:33
eat each other up.

72
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
This ji cancels this one if you
look at the system as a whole--

73
00:04:33 --> 00:04:39
not if you look
at the individual particles,

74
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
but on the system as a whole,
they all cancel each other out.

75
00:04:40 --> 00:04:46
And so the total force
on the system

76
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
is simply
the total force external.

77
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
And all the internal forces--
you can forget about it.

78
00:04:53 --> 00:04:59
And this means, then, that
we come to a key conclusion--

79
00:04:58 --> 00:05:04
that dp total/dt...

80
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
in fact, I have it
written down there.

81
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
It's so important
that I want you to look at it

82
00:05:06 --> 00:05:12
this whole lecture.

83
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
Look at this.

84
00:05:09 --> 00:05:15
You see that dp/dt
is the total force externally--

85
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
forget all the internal forces--

86
00:05:15 --> 00:05:21
and what it means...
that if the external force,

87
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
the total external force
on the whole system is zero,

88
00:05:22 --> 00:05:28
it means that the momentum
cannot change.

89
00:05:25 --> 00:05:31
Momentum is conserved,

90
00:05:27 --> 00:05:33
and that's called
the conservation of momentum.

91
00:05:31 --> 00:05:37
It only holds if the sum
of all external forces are zero.

92
00:05:35 --> 00:05:41
We could have hundreds of stars,
like a globular cluster,

93
00:05:39 --> 00:05:45
and they could collide
with each other,

94
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
they could explode,
they could break apart--

95
00:05:44 --> 00:05:50
all those forces are internal,
they don't count.

96
00:05:47 --> 00:05:53
The angular mo... the momentum
of the cluster as a whole--

97
00:05:51 --> 00:05:57
not angular momentum,
I misspoke.

98
00:05:53 --> 00:05:59
The momentum of the cluster
as a whole would not change

99
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
if there are no external forces
on the system,

100
00:06:01 --> 00:06:07
if the net sum, the total
external force, is zero.

101
00:06:05 --> 00:06:11

102
00:06:08 --> 00:06:14
So the individual stars

103
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
will change their momentum
all the time,

104
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
because the individual particles
in the individual stars

105
00:06:15 --> 00:06:21
will experience, of course,
the internal forces.

106
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
I'm not saying that
the individual particles

107
00:06:20 --> 00:06:26
do not continuously experience
momentum changes.

108
00:06:23 --> 00:06:29
It's just the system as a whole

109
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
for which the momentum
is then conserved.

110
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
We can do a very simple example

111
00:06:32 --> 00:06:38
so that you get
a feeling... numerical idea.

112
00:06:37 --> 00:06:43
I would have a...
an object here as mass, m1,

113
00:06:41 --> 00:06:47
and here I have one, m2,

114
00:06:44 --> 00:06:50
and let this one have
a velocity, v1,

115
00:06:48 --> 00:06:54
and this one has a velocity, v2.

116
00:06:51 --> 00:06:57
One-dimensional problem,
just as a warm-up.

117
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
They plow into each other
and they stick together.

118
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
I put some glue on one,
and so they stick together.

119
00:07:03 --> 00:07:09
That's a given.

120
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
You have to accept that.

121
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
Let this be the direction
of increasing x,

122
00:07:08 --> 00:07:14
and so before the collision

123
00:07:10 --> 00:07:16
I have a certain amount
of momentum.

124
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
I can do this on a horizontal
table, which is frictionless.

125
00:07:16 --> 00:07:22
I can do it on an ice surface,
which is nearly frictionless

126
00:07:20 --> 00:07:26
and I ignore air drag.

127
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
So this is the situation before,

128
00:07:25 --> 00:07:31
and so the momentum that
I have before equals m1 v1--

129
00:07:30 --> 00:07:36
this is my plus direction--

130
00:07:33 --> 00:07:39
I could put vectors over there
but that's really not necessary,

131
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
because it's
a one-dimensional problem--

132
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
plus m2v2.

133
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47
If you like that, be my guest.

134
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
That's the momentum before.

135
00:07:46 --> 00:07:52
Now they stick together

136
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
and so when they stick together,
their total mass is m1 + m2.

137
00:07:52 --> 00:07:58
And then their velocity
happens to be v prime.

138
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
We often give a prime
to the situation

139
00:07:58 --> 00:08:04
after the collision occurs.

140
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
And so now I can apply,
for the first time,

141
00:08:03 --> 00:08:09
the conservation of momentum.

142
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
The momentum before must be the
same as the momentum afterwards

143
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
because there are no
external forces on the system.

144
00:08:12 --> 00:08:18
When they collide,
you better believe it

145
00:08:14 --> 00:08:20
that there are internal forces.

146
00:08:16 --> 00:08:22
You better believe that there
is glue and it goes "plunk"

147
00:08:19 --> 00:08:25
and they feel those forces,
both of them.

148
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
The momentum of each one
individually is changing,

149
00:08:24 --> 00:08:30
but not the momentum
of the system as a whole,

150
00:08:30 --> 00:08:36
and so this equals
(m1 + m2) v prime.

151
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40
And so, if you put in
some numbers--

152
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
suppose m1 equals one kilogram,

153
00:08:41 --> 00:08:47
and v1 is five meters
per second,

154
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
let m2 be two kilograms and let
v2 be three meters per second.

155
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
And you see, since they are both
in the same direction

156
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
momentum here is 5 + 6 is 11,
so this is 11.

157
00:09:01 --> 00:09:07
And this is 1 + 2 is 3,
so that is 3 times v1 prime,

158
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
and so v1 prime is eleven-thirds
meters per second.

159
00:09:11 --> 00:09:17
So the conservation of momentum

160
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
tells you what the speed is
after the collision.

161
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23

162
00:09:18 --> 00:09:24
When we deal with collisions,

163
00:09:19 --> 00:09:25
the velocities of the objects
before the collision

164
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
are unprimed.

165
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
You see here v1,
and you see here v2.

166
00:09:27 --> 00:09:33
Now, the velocities
after the collisions,

167
00:09:31 --> 00:09:37
by convention, are primed.

168
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
You see here v prime.

169
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
Now if after the collision

170
00:09:37 --> 00:09:43
object one and object two
have a different velocity,

171
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
we will call it v1 prime
and v2 prime.

172
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
Now in this case, we're dealing
with an inelastic collision,

173
00:09:49 --> 00:09:55
so m1 and m2 are stuck together.

174
00:09:51 --> 00:09:57
They are merged,

175
00:09:52 --> 00:09:58
so it is sufficient
to just call it v prime.

176
00:09:55 --> 00:10:01
You could have called it
v1 prime,

177
00:09:58 --> 00:10:04
because v1 prime is the same as
v2 prime is the same as v prime.

178
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
And during
the next four minutes,

179
00:10:05 --> 00:10:11
you will see that a few times
do I call it v1 prime.

180
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
I wish I really hadn't.

181
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
It would be better
if I had just used v prime.

182
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
That is unique and sufficient.

183
00:10:15 --> 00:10:21

184
00:10:17 --> 00:10:23
Now, there was a certain amount
of kinetic energy

185
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
before the collision,

186
00:10:22 --> 00:10:28
and of course, we can
all calculate that--

187
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
kinetic energy
before the collision.

188
00:10:29 --> 00:10:35
That is one-half m1 v1 squared
plus one-half m2 v2 squared--

189
00:10:35 --> 00:10:41
one-half m1 v1 squared,
one-half m2 v2 squared.

190
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
How much is it?

191
00:10:43 --> 00:10:49
You can do that
as well as I can.

192
00:10:46 --> 00:10:52
If you add that up,
you will find 21.5 joules.

193
00:10:50 --> 00:10:56
Trivial to stick in the numbers.

194
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
Now I want to hear from you.

195
00:10:56 --> 00:11:02

196
00:10:58 --> 00:11:04
What do you think the situation
is with the kinetic energy

197
00:11:02 --> 00:11:08
after the collision?

198
00:11:03 --> 00:11:09
Don't look at the numbers.

199
00:11:05 --> 00:11:11
Just use your intuition.

200
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
It may be wrong.

201
00:11:07 --> 00:11:13
That's okay, my intuition
is often wrong.

202
00:11:10 --> 00:11:16
So there was a certain amount
of kinetic energy.

203
00:11:12 --> 00:11:18
We had this collision,
and I want you to tell me

204
00:11:15 --> 00:11:21
whether you think
that the kinetic energy

205
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
has perhaps increased
or decreased

206
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
or maybe the kinetic energy
hasn't changed.

207
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
Who thinks the kinetic energy
has not changed?

208
00:11:26 --> 00:11:32
Good for you.

209
00:11:27 --> 00:11:33
I see some parents even.

210
00:11:30 --> 00:11:36
Who thinks the kinetic energy
has decreased?

211
00:11:34 --> 00:11:40
Even better for you.

212
00:11:35 --> 00:11:41
Hey, there's a professor
of physics there.

213
00:11:37 --> 00:11:43
Can't go wrong there.

214
00:11:38 --> 00:11:44
And who thinks the kinetic
energy has increased?

215
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
No one thinks that.

216
00:11:43 --> 00:11:49
Hey, it's amazing.

217
00:11:45 --> 00:11:51
Let's take a look.

218
00:11:47 --> 00:11:53
Kinetic energy
after the collision.

219
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
That would be one-half m1
plus m2 times v prime squared.

220
00:11:59 --> 00:12:05
Would we agree?

221
00:12:01 --> 00:12:07
Let me write this
at a different location.

222
00:12:04 --> 00:12:10
So this was the 21½ joules.

223
00:12:10 --> 00:12:16
Well, you can do this
as well as I can.

224
00:12:12 --> 00:12:18
We know that v1 prime is--
that is eleven-thirds.

225
00:12:16 --> 00:12:22
And you will find that this
number equals 20.2 joules.

226
00:12:20 --> 00:12:26
So the kinetic energy went down.

227
00:12:22 --> 00:12:28
Now, you may say,
"Well, big deal.

228
00:12:25 --> 00:12:31
"Little bit of kinetic energy--
1.3 joules.

229
00:12:28 --> 00:12:34
Who cares about 1.3 joules?"

230
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
Well, it is a real big deal
in physics, let me tell you.

231
00:12:34 --> 00:12:40
And I can appre...
I can make you appreciate

232
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
that it is a real big deal
by doing the following.

233
00:12:40 --> 00:12:46
I don't change the masses,

234
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
but I just am going to change
the direction of the impact.

235
00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
Here is m1 and here is m2.

236
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
The speeds remain the same--
v1 and this is v2.

237
00:12:58 --> 00:13:04
No change in the numbers

238
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
except that they go now
(whooshes ) head-on.

239
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
What is the momentum
of particle number one?

240
00:13:06 --> 00:13:12
Well, that is mv.

241
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
1 x 5 is plus 5.

242
00:13:09 --> 00:13:15
Remember, this is the increasing
direction of X.

243
00:13:13 --> 00:13:19
So the momentum is plus 5.

244
00:13:16 --> 00:13:22
What is the other one?

245
00:13:17 --> 00:13:23
That is 2 x 3,
that is 6, backwards.

246
00:13:21 --> 00:13:27
This is minus 6.

247
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
So what is the total...
the total momentum...

248
00:13:25 --> 00:13:31
let's give it a magnitude
equals minus 1?

249
00:13:28 --> 00:13:34
The magnitude is one, of course

250
00:13:30 --> 00:13:36
and the momentum,
if I leave this off

251
00:13:32 --> 00:13:38
we would call that minus one

252
00:13:33 --> 00:13:39
because it's
a one-dimensional problem.

253
00:13:35 --> 00:13:41
The momentum before
is in this direction.

254
00:13:38 --> 00:13:44
It's minus one.

255
00:13:39 --> 00:13:45
So what now is v prime?

256
00:13:41 --> 00:13:47
They stick together.

257
00:13:43 --> 00:13:49
Here they are.

258
00:13:44 --> 00:13:50
And afterwards,
I'm not even sure

259
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52
whether they go this way
or this way.

260
00:13:49 --> 00:13:55
Yes, I am sure, because the
momentum is in this direction,

261
00:13:52 --> 00:13:58
so I predict that v1 prime
will be in this direction.

262
00:13:56 --> 00:14:02
And so this now equals m1
plus m2 times the new v1 prime.

263
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
Well, m1 plus m2 is 1 + 2,
is 3 kilograms

264
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
and so you see that v1 prime

265
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
equals minus one-third meters
per second.

266
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
So the whole system now goes off

267
00:14:15 --> 00:14:21
with one-third meters per second
in this direction.

268
00:14:18 --> 00:14:24
The kinetic energy before
has not changed--

269
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
those 21½ joules, right?

270
00:14:22 --> 00:14:28
That is independent of how
I collide them with each other.

271
00:14:26 --> 00:14:32
What now is the kinetic energy
afterwards?

272
00:14:30 --> 00:14:36
This is a great tragedy,

273
00:14:32 --> 00:14:38
because now you get one-half
the sum of the masses,

274
00:14:36 --> 00:14:42
which is three times
this small number squared.

275
00:14:40 --> 00:14:46
Goes with V squared, right?

276
00:14:42 --> 00:14:48
And now there
is only 0.17 joules left.

277
00:14:49 --> 00:14:55
Almost all kinet... kinetic
energy has been destroyed.

278
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00
So what you see here
in front of your eyes--

279
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
that kinetic energy
can be destroyed,

280
00:14:59 --> 00:15:05
but momentum cannot be destroyed

281
00:15:01 --> 00:15:07
in the absence
of external forces.

282
00:15:03 --> 00:15:09
Kinetic energy and momentum
is a totally different thing.

283
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
The momentum of the individual
particles gets changed,

284
00:15:09 --> 00:15:15
but the net momentum
did not change

285
00:15:11 --> 00:15:17
but the kinetic energy
was destroyed.

286
00:15:14 --> 00:15:20
I can destroy the kinetic energy
completely if I want that.

287
00:15:18 --> 00:15:24
I can arrange a collision

288
00:15:20 --> 00:15:26
so that all kinetic energy
has been removed.

289
00:15:24 --> 00:15:30
Suppose this particle has a mass
five and the velocity is one.

290
00:15:29 --> 00:15:35
This is my shorthand notation.

291
00:15:31 --> 00:15:37
And this particle has a mass one
but it has a velocity five.

292
00:15:36 --> 00:15:42
The momentum of this system
is zero--

293
00:15:38 --> 00:15:44
plus five in this direction,
minus five in this direction.

294
00:15:42 --> 00:15:48
But you bet your life
there is kinetic energy.

295
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
After they collision...
they hit each other,

296
00:15:47 --> 00:15:53
we agreed that they would stick,
there was glue on it.

297
00:15:50 --> 00:15:56
Momentum afterwards must
therefore still be zero.

298
00:15:53 --> 00:15:59
Internal forces don't matter
no matter what happens.

299
00:15:57 --> 00:16:03
Kinetic energy is zero.

300
00:15:59 --> 00:16:05
So the whole system collides--
(bing )--

301
00:16:02 --> 00:16:08
And afterwards you have here
the sum of the total masses

302
00:16:06 --> 00:16:12
and it just stands still,

303
00:16:08 --> 00:16:14
because I told you that they are
going to stick together.

304
00:16:12 --> 00:16:18
I used glue.

305
00:16:13 --> 00:16:19

306
00:16:15 --> 00:16:21
If you have a car collision,
and two cars hit each other,

307
00:16:21 --> 00:16:27
and I compare the situation
just before the collision

308
00:16:26 --> 00:16:32
with just after the collision--

309
00:16:28 --> 00:16:34
here are the two cars and one
has a speed in this direction,

310
00:16:31 --> 00:16:37
the other has a speed
in this direction,

311
00:16:34 --> 00:16:40
and they hit each other.

312
00:16:35 --> 00:16:41
And they stick together,
it's a given.

313
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43
You go (whooshes )--
one big clump.

314
00:16:40 --> 00:16:46
So this is before.

315
00:16:41 --> 00:16:47

316
00:16:44 --> 00:16:50
And I can give them
some velocities.

317
00:16:47 --> 00:16:53
This is the speed of one, v1,

318
00:16:49 --> 00:16:55
and this is the speed
of the other, v2.

319
00:16:53 --> 00:16:59
Afterwards you see something
like this: v prime.

320
00:16:58 --> 00:17:04
Just a wreck!

321
00:16:59 --> 00:17:05

322
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
The impact time is so short

323
00:17:03 --> 00:17:09
that the change in momentum
due to friction with the road--

324
00:17:08 --> 00:17:14
that would be an external force,
friction with the road.

325
00:17:12 --> 00:17:18
But that can be ignored,
is negligibly small.

326
00:17:15 --> 00:17:21
The cars hit.

327
00:17:17 --> 00:17:23
There is a huge internal force
going on.

328
00:17:21 --> 00:17:27
One slams on the other
and the other slams on one.

329
00:17:25 --> 00:17:31
There is even fireworks--
metal scrapes over metal.

330
00:17:28 --> 00:17:34
Friction, but that's
internal friction,

331
00:17:31 --> 00:17:37
not friction with the road.

332
00:17:33 --> 00:17:39
So momentum is approximately
conserved

333
00:17:37 --> 00:17:43
if we can ignore the friction
from the road during the impact

334
00:17:43 --> 00:17:49
because the impact time
is so short.

335
00:17:46 --> 00:17:52
So let here be car with mass m1

336
00:17:48 --> 00:17:54
and here is the other car
with mass m2.

337
00:17:51 --> 00:17:57
And we'll make it
a two-dimensional problem,

338
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
because we have seen only
one-dimensional problems now.

339
00:17:58 --> 00:18:04
Let's make it
a two-dimensional problem.

340
00:18:01 --> 00:18:07
So this is the direction
for this car,

341
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
and let's say
this is the direction

342
00:18:07 --> 00:18:13
in which the other car is going,
velocity v2.

343
00:18:10 --> 00:18:16
And tragedy has it
that this is the place

344
00:18:13 --> 00:18:19
where they're going to collide.

345
00:18:15 --> 00:18:21

346
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
In what direction
and what will be the speed

347
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
after the collision?

348
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
I only compare just the moment
before they hit

349
00:18:25 --> 00:18:31
with just the moment
after they hit.

350
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
What comes later
is a different story.

351
00:18:29 --> 00:18:35
When you have formed the wreck,

352
00:18:31 --> 00:18:37
clearly it's going to slide
on the road,

353
00:18:34 --> 00:18:40
and then there is an external
force which is friction,

354
00:18:37 --> 00:18:43
which will slow it down.

355
00:18:38 --> 00:18:44
It's just during the impact
I claim that

356
00:18:41 --> 00:18:47
to a reasonable approximation,

357
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
momentum will have
to be conserved.

358
00:18:46 --> 00:18:52
And so, what is the momentum
of this one?

359
00:18:49 --> 00:18:55
Well, this may be
the momentum of this one.

360
00:18:52 --> 00:18:58
It may have a very small mass,
small speed.

361
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
And what is the momentum
of this one?

362
00:18:57 --> 00:19:03
Well, this may be the momentum
of number one

363
00:19:00 --> 00:19:06
and this could be the momentum
of number two.

364
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
The net momentum is
the vectorial sum of these two,

365
00:19:09 --> 00:19:15
which is this.

366
00:19:13 --> 00:19:19
That is p total of the system.

367
00:19:15 --> 00:19:21
That is never going to change.

368
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
That's before and after
the collision exactly the same.

369
00:19:21 --> 00:19:27
And therefore if you knew
this angle theta

370
00:19:24 --> 00:19:30
and you know p1 and you know p2,
then you can calculate

371
00:19:28 --> 00:19:34
in what direction the objects
are going to slide,

372
00:19:32 --> 00:19:38
but of course you can
also calculate then

373
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
the velocity after the impact,
because this total momentum

374
00:19:40 --> 00:19:46
must be the sum of the total
of the two cars--

375
00:19:43 --> 00:19:49
the mass of the two cars--
times v prime.

376
00:19:46 --> 00:19:52
And so you can calculate
everything.

377
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
And that's what
the police is doing

378
00:19:51 --> 00:19:57
when they find wrecks
on the road.

379
00:19:53 --> 00:19:59
They actually use
the... the track,

380
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
the... the skidding tracks of
the wreck to calculate v prime,

381
00:19:59 --> 00:20:05
and then they can try
to reconstruct the situation

382
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
as it was before the collision.

383
00:20:04 --> 00:20:10
Now, in all these cases,
the objects stuck together.

384
00:20:09 --> 00:20:15
We've only considered cases
where they stick together,

385
00:20:12 --> 00:20:18
in which case we call those
in physics

386
00:20:15 --> 00:20:21
"completely inelastic
collisions."

387
00:20:17 --> 00:20:23
Now, next lecture I will
also deal with situations

388
00:20:20 --> 00:20:26
whereby during the collision,

389
00:20:22 --> 00:20:28
the particles bounce off
each other.

390
00:20:25 --> 00:20:31
In completely
inelastic collisions,

391
00:20:27 --> 00:20:33
you always lose kinetic energy--

392
00:20:30 --> 00:20:36
sometimes a little,
as you see there; 

393
00:20:32 --> 00:20:38
sometimes a lot,
as you see there; 

394
00:20:35 --> 00:20:41
sometimes everything,
as you see there.

395
00:20:38 --> 00:20:44
Always in inelastic collisions
do you lose kinetic energy.

396
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
Can we have, in a collision,
an increase of kinetic energy?

397
00:20:50 --> 00:20:56
Well, depends on how you define
the word "collision."

398
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
The answer is yes.

399
00:20:54 --> 00:21:00
And in fact,
I will show you an example

400
00:20:57 --> 00:21:03
and even do a demonstration.

401
00:20:59 --> 00:21:05

402
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
In the most simple case
that I can think of,

403
00:21:04 --> 00:21:10
I have here a block
which has a certain mass, m.

404
00:21:07 --> 00:21:13
But there is an explosive inside

405
00:21:10 --> 00:21:16
and all of a sudden,
it goes "Boom!"

406
00:21:12 --> 00:21:18
It explodes.

407
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
Well, before, the speed is zero
and so the momentum is zero.

408
00:21:20 --> 00:21:26
And there comes the bang--
(whooshes )

409
00:21:23 --> 00:21:29
and one piece flies
in this direction

410
00:21:28 --> 00:21:34
with a certain velocity,
v2 prime.

411
00:21:33 --> 00:21:39
This is m2.

412
00:21:34 --> 00:21:40
And another piece flies off
in this direction

413
00:21:39 --> 00:21:45
with mass m1,
with velocity v1 prime.

414
00:21:43 --> 00:21:49
Clearly, momentum
must be conserved.

415
00:21:46 --> 00:21:52
This explosion
is only internal forces,

416
00:21:49 --> 00:21:55
and so you can write down...

417
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
if you call this
the increasing direction of x,

418
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
so this momentum is positive
and this momentum is negative,

419
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04
the total momentum
will never change.

420
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
It's the same before
as it is afterwards,

421
00:22:06 --> 00:22:12
so this must be m2 times v2
prime minus m1 times v1 prime.

422
00:22:12 --> 00:22:18
What happened
with the kinetic energy?

423
00:22:15 --> 00:22:21
Well, kinetic energy
has clearly increased.

424
00:22:18 --> 00:22:24
There was zero kinetic energy
to start with.

425
00:22:21 --> 00:22:27
This one now has kinetic energy
and this one has kinetic energy.

426
00:22:24 --> 00:22:30
Where did that come from?

427
00:22:25 --> 00:22:31
Well, it was the chemical
reaction of the explosion.

428
00:22:28 --> 00:22:34
Momentum, however,
was conserved.

429
00:22:30 --> 00:22:36
See, momentum really doesn't
care about these explosions.

430
00:22:34 --> 00:22:40
That's all internal forces.

431
00:22:36 --> 00:22:42
So be very careful.

432
00:22:37 --> 00:22:43
Never confuse momentum
with energy.

433
00:22:40 --> 00:22:46
Energy can change
or cannot change,

434
00:22:42 --> 00:22:48
can increase or decrease or
remain the same kinetic energy,

435
00:22:46 --> 00:22:52
but if there are no external
forces on the system,

436
00:22:49 --> 00:22:55
momentum is always conserved.

437
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57

438
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
And this is what I can show you.

439
00:22:55 --> 00:23:01
I have a demonstration set up
on this air track,

440
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
and we do it on an air track so
there is a minimum of friction.

441
00:23:03 --> 00:23:09
And we're going to push
two cars together

442
00:23:06 --> 00:23:12
and we hold them together
with a spring.

443
00:23:12 --> 00:23:18
The spring is like
the explosion,

444
00:23:15 --> 00:23:21
like the dynamite
that can push these apart.

445
00:23:19 --> 00:23:25
So here is one car
on the air track,

446
00:23:22 --> 00:23:28
then there is a spring
and there is another car.

447
00:23:26 --> 00:23:32
Let this mass be m1
and this mass be m2,

448
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
and this surface
is nearly frictionless.

449
00:23:32 --> 00:23:38
And I hold them together
with a string

450
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
so that I can pull
the spring in.

451
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47
So this spring is compressed,

452
00:23:44 --> 00:23:50
and the whole system is at rest,
v equals zero.

453
00:23:48 --> 00:23:54
There is potential energy
in that spring.

454
00:23:50 --> 00:23:56
I take a burner (whooshes ),
and I burn away this thread.

455
00:23:55 --> 00:24:01
This is the situation before.

456
00:23:59 --> 00:24:05
Momentum before is zero.

457
00:24:03 --> 00:24:09
Total momentum afterwards
would also be zero.

458
00:24:06 --> 00:24:12
It's identical
to what I did there.

459
00:24:09 --> 00:24:15
And so this object will fly
in this direction,

460
00:24:12 --> 00:24:18
and this object will fly
in that direction.

461
00:24:16 --> 00:24:22
And you already can tell

462
00:24:17 --> 00:24:23
what the ratio
of the velocities will be,

463
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
because you will see that
v2 prime divided by v1 prime--

464
00:24:27 --> 00:24:33
you see it right there--
equals m1 divided by m2.

465
00:24:35 --> 00:24:41
And so I will make
some predictions

466
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
about the speed
of these two objects.

467
00:24:41 --> 00:24:47
The largest mass, by the way,
would get the smallest velocity,

468
00:24:47 --> 00:24:53
and the smallest mass would get
the largest velocity,

469
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
the largest speed.

470
00:24:53 --> 00:24:59
What you see in here
are really speeds.

471
00:24:56 --> 00:25:02
We don't have the information
on the direction anymore.

472
00:24:59 --> 00:25:05
How do we measure the speed?

473
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
Well, we actually measure
the time

474
00:25:04 --> 00:25:10
for the cars
to move ten centimeters.

475
00:25:07 --> 00:25:13
Each car has
a little metal plate

476
00:25:10 --> 00:25:16
which is ten centimeters long,

477
00:25:13 --> 00:25:19
and it blanks out
a light-emitting diode.

478
00:25:16 --> 00:25:22
And the moment that the light-
emitting diode is occluded,

479
00:25:20 --> 00:25:26
the timer starts,

480
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
and the moment that the light-
emitting diode emerges again,

481
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
the timer stops.

482
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
So that's the way
we will measure the time

483
00:25:29 --> 00:25:35
for each car to move
by ten centimeters.

484
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
The first experiment
that I will be doing,

485
00:25:35 --> 00:25:41
m1 is 244 plus or minus one gram

486
00:25:38 --> 00:25:44
and m2 is also 244
plus or minus one gram.

487
00:25:46 --> 00:25:52
In other words,
the uncertainty in the masses

488
00:25:50 --> 00:25:56
is something like 0.4%.

489
00:25:52 --> 00:25:58
That's just part of life.

490
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
I can't do much better.

491
00:25:56 --> 00:26:02

492
00:25:58 --> 00:26:04
The time that it takes
for object number one

493
00:26:01 --> 00:26:07
to go ten centimeters
is obviously ten divided by v1,

494
00:26:05 --> 00:26:11
which is the velocity that
we want to compare them with.

495
00:26:09 --> 00:26:15
Now, the ten centimeters
is really only known

496
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
to an accuracy
of about one millimeters.

497
00:26:17 --> 00:26:23
So that is an uncertainty of 1%
in my timing in my velocity,

498
00:26:23 --> 00:26:29
so this is a 1% uncertainty.

499
00:26:25 --> 00:26:31
So if we measure the times

500
00:26:28 --> 00:26:34
that object number one
and object number two

501
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
will go through
this timing device--

502
00:26:34 --> 00:26:40
a measurement
of ten centimeters--

503
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
you would expect the times
to be the same

504
00:26:39 --> 00:26:45
to within roughly 1 + .5...
say 1½%.

505
00:26:42 --> 00:26:48
There is, however,
an additional problem

506
00:26:45 --> 00:26:51
that is very difficult
for me to evaluate

507
00:26:48 --> 00:26:54
and that's the following.

508
00:26:50 --> 00:26:56
If here is
the light-emitting diode,

509
00:26:52 --> 00:26:58
and here is that metal plate
that I mentioned to you,

510
00:26:55 --> 00:27:01
which comes over this diode,

511
00:26:57 --> 00:27:03
occludes the diode,
and says "start the timer,"

512
00:27:00 --> 00:27:06
and then the other end,
of course,

513
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
moves off
and then the timer stops--

514
00:27:04 --> 00:27:10
that criterion for on and off
for one diode

515
00:27:07 --> 00:27:13
may not be exactly the same
as for the other.

516
00:27:10 --> 00:27:16
Here is one system.

517
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
One car will fly
in this direction.

518
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
And here is another system,

519
00:27:15 --> 00:27:21
and the car will fly
in that direction.

520
00:27:18 --> 00:27:24
And that's not so easy
to evaluate

521
00:27:20 --> 00:27:26
unless you do
a lot of experiments.

522
00:27:22 --> 00:27:28
So I would roughly guess--

523
00:27:24 --> 00:27:30
I'm always on
the conservative side--

524
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
that this may add an uncertainty
in the criterion of the diode

525
00:27:29 --> 00:27:35
of another millimeter.

526
00:27:30 --> 00:27:36
And so effectively,

527
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
I really don't know any better
than two millimeters

528
00:27:35 --> 00:27:41
what the ten centimeters is.

529
00:27:37 --> 00:27:43
So I would say we really
have to allow here

530
00:27:40 --> 00:27:46
for two percent plus .4%,

531
00:27:42 --> 00:27:48
so I would predict that
the times of these two cars

532
00:27:46 --> 00:27:52
will be the same
to within roughly 2½%.

533
00:27:49 --> 00:27:55
That would be my prediction.

534
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
So we're going to write down
here the times,

535
00:27:54 --> 00:28:00
and then we're going
to measure them.

536
00:27:57 --> 00:28:03
So time one and time two,

537
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
and we will see whether
these two numbers are the same

538
00:28:03 --> 00:28:09
within the uncertainty
of our measurements.

539
00:28:06 --> 00:28:12
Here is the air track.

540
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
Have to turn on the airflow.

541
00:28:11 --> 00:28:17
Oh, let me tell,
for those of you...

542
00:28:14 --> 00:28:20

543
00:28:16 --> 00:28:22
For the parents in my audience
who haven't seen this one,

544
00:28:20 --> 00:28:26
this is a marvelous device.

545
00:28:21 --> 00:28:27
It is a track
which is well-constructed,

546
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
so that these cars
fit beautifully

547
00:28:26 --> 00:28:32
on this V-shaped track, and then
we blow air out of this track,

548
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
which lifts these cars up
so that they float,

549
00:28:33 --> 00:28:39
and so we can move them
in horizontal direction

550
00:28:35 --> 00:28:41
with extremely little friction.

551
00:28:37 --> 00:28:43
There is no metal
touching metal.

552
00:28:39 --> 00:28:45
The only friction you have
is the air drag.

553
00:28:41 --> 00:28:47
That you can never avoid.

554
00:28:43 --> 00:28:49
When you go through the air
with a car, there is wind--

555
00:28:45 --> 00:28:51
the same wind that you feel
when you drive your bicycle.

556
00:28:48 --> 00:28:54
But there's very little,

557
00:28:49 --> 00:28:55
and that's why these experiments
are done on these air tracks.

558
00:28:53 --> 00:28:59

559
00:28:56 --> 00:29:02
These are not cheap, by the way,
these air tracks--
 

560
00:28:59 --> 00:29:05
they're very expensive.

561
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
Well, you... you pay
$25,000 tuition,

562
00:29:03 --> 00:29:09
so you might as well get
something for it, right?

563
00:29:06 --> 00:29:12

564
00:29:08 --> 00:29:14
So I hope that these timers
are on.

565
00:29:10 --> 00:29:16
They are.

566
00:29:11 --> 00:29:17

567
00:29:13 --> 00:29:19
And now we have here one car,

568
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
and notice how frictionless
it goes when I touch it.

569
00:29:23 --> 00:29:29
Very nice, almost frictionless.

570
00:29:26 --> 00:29:32
And here we have another one,

571
00:29:28 --> 00:29:34
and they have equal mass
to within one gram.

572
00:29:31 --> 00:29:37
And there is a spring
between them.

573
00:29:34 --> 00:29:40
Some of you may be able
to see it.

574
00:29:36 --> 00:29:42
And I'm going to attach now that
string to hold them together.

575
00:29:41 --> 00:29:47
And so I put potential energy
in the spring

576
00:29:45 --> 00:29:51
by pushing them together,
and they are lined up now here.

577
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
They have no momentum.

578
00:29:51 --> 00:29:57
The timer's not on?

579
00:29:53 --> 00:29:59
Has to be reset.

580
00:29:55 --> 00:30:01
Thank you.

581
00:29:56 --> 00:30:02

582
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
They're now both zero.

583
00:30:00 --> 00:30:06
Yeah, you're sure?

584
00:30:01 --> 00:30:07
Okay.

585
00:30:02 --> 00:30:08
So now I'm going
to burn off that wire.

586
00:30:04 --> 00:30:10
The momentum of each one
of those cars will change.

587
00:30:07 --> 00:30:13
One will go in this direction,
the other one in this direction.

588
00:30:11 --> 00:30:17
Kinetic energy will increase.

589
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
That's the potential energy
from the spring.

590
00:30:16 --> 00:30:22
But the momentum
of the system as a whole

591
00:30:19 --> 00:30:25
after I burn the wire
will remain zero.

592
00:30:22 --> 00:30:28
Ready for this?

593
00:30:23 --> 00:30:29

594
00:30:28 --> 00:30:34
Make me happy.

595
00:30:30 --> 00:30:36
What do you see?

596
00:30:31 --> 00:30:37

597
00:30:34 --> 00:30:40
You're going to make me unhappy?

598
00:30:36 --> 00:30:42
I better walk around.

599
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
I can't wait.

600
00:30:39 --> 00:30:45
220... oh, fantastic,
absolutely fantastic!

601
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
223, 219 milliseconds.

602
00:30:46 --> 00:30:52
That is well
within the uncertainties.

603
00:30:49 --> 00:30:55

604
00:30:50 --> 00:30:56
What was the number, 219?

605
00:30:53 --> 00:30:59

606
00:30:58 --> 00:31:04
219 milliseconds
and 223 milliseconds.

607
00:31:02 --> 00:31:08

608
00:31:04 --> 00:31:10
If I repeat the experiment
and I make the string shorter,

609
00:31:08 --> 00:31:14
I will get different primes.

610
00:31:10 --> 00:31:16
I can never predict the times,

611
00:31:12 --> 00:31:18
because if I make the spring
more squeezed,

612
00:31:14 --> 00:31:20
then obviously I will have
more potential energy.

613
00:31:18 --> 00:31:24
And so the speeds of the cars
will be higher,

614
00:31:20 --> 00:31:26
but the times will be the same

615
00:31:22 --> 00:31:28
within the uncertainty
of the measurements.

616
00:31:25 --> 00:31:31
So I can never predict the time.

617
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
Now we're going
to do an experiment

618
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
whereby I'm going to make m2
twice the mass.

619
00:31:39 --> 00:31:45
m2 is 488 plus or minus
one gram.

620
00:31:42 --> 00:31:48

621
00:31:44 --> 00:31:50
Now, that's going
to be interesting,

622
00:31:46 --> 00:31:52
because now you really
begin to test

623
00:31:48 --> 00:31:54
the conservation of momentum.

624
00:31:50 --> 00:31:56
The momentum before is zero.

625
00:31:52 --> 00:31:58
I burn the wire, momentum
afterwards is also zero.

626
00:31:57 --> 00:32:03
But the velocities...
oh, I erased this--

627
00:32:01 --> 00:32:07
v2 prime divided by v1 prime
equals m1 divided by m2.

628
00:32:07 --> 00:32:13
And so twice the mass
will get half the speed.

629
00:32:12 --> 00:32:18
And so now you're going to see

630
00:32:14 --> 00:32:20
that one car will go twice
as slow as the other.

631
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23
That's the only way that nature
can conserve momentum.

632
00:32:20 --> 00:32:26
Nature has no choice.

633
00:32:22 --> 00:32:28
Nature can deal with kinetic
energy one way or another,

634
00:32:26 --> 00:32:32
but it cannot finagle momentum.

635
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
So it must give
the more massive car

636
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
half the speed
than it gives the other car.

637
00:32:34 --> 00:32:40
And so we're going
to redo this experiment

638
00:32:38 --> 00:32:44
now with a car here
which is twice the mass.

639
00:32:44 --> 00:32:50

640
00:32:46 --> 00:32:52
And this one equals...

641
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56

642
00:32:55 --> 00:33:01
Where is my other car?

643
00:32:56 --> 00:33:02
Oh, my car is here.

644
00:32:57 --> 00:33:03

645
00:33:01 --> 00:33:07
And this one is one mass,
so this is the 244,

646
00:33:04 --> 00:33:10
and the one on the...
on your right is the 488.

647
00:33:08 --> 00:33:14
So I have to bring them together
again with a string.

648
00:33:12 --> 00:33:18

649
00:33:14 --> 00:33:20
So I... I do the work now.

650
00:33:16 --> 00:33:22
I always do the work here
in 26.100.

651
00:33:19 --> 00:33:25
I do the work.

652
00:33:20 --> 00:33:26
I squeeze these springs.

653
00:33:22 --> 00:33:28
I get paid for that, by the way.

654
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
And that's potential energy
that goes into the spring.

655
00:33:28 --> 00:33:34
There it is.

656
00:33:29 --> 00:33:35
Momentum is zero.

657
00:33:31 --> 00:33:37
Kinetic energy is zero.

658
00:33:33 --> 00:33:39
I have to zero the timers.

659
00:33:36 --> 00:33:42

660
00:33:38 --> 00:33:44
Oh, and I would like
to make a prediction.

661
00:33:42 --> 00:33:48
I would like to see...

662
00:33:44 --> 00:33:50
we'll measure T1
and then we'll measure T2,

663
00:33:48 --> 00:33:54
and then we get a number
and we get a number,

664
00:33:51 --> 00:33:57
and if we multiply this number
by 2.00,

665
00:33:54 --> 00:34:00
then I would like
to get this number

666
00:33:57 --> 00:34:03
within the uncertainties
of the measurements.

667
00:34:00 --> 00:34:06
There is always an uncertainty
in any measurement that you do.

668
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
All right?

669
00:34:07 --> 00:34:13
Make sure that...
are the timers zero?

670
00:34:09 --> 00:34:15

671
00:34:12 --> 00:34:18
Okay, there we go.

672
00:34:13 --> 00:34:19

673
00:34:22 --> 00:34:28
What do you see?

674
00:34:25 --> 00:34:31
Ah! 406, 193-- whoo!

675
00:34:28 --> 00:34:34
On the button!

676
00:34:30 --> 00:34:36
406 and 193.

677
00:34:35 --> 00:34:41
0.406-- is that what you see?

678
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
Yeah?

679
00:34:42 --> 00:34:48
And 0.193.

680
00:34:44 --> 00:34:50
Now, I don't even need
my calculator

681
00:34:46 --> 00:34:52
to multiply this by two.

682
00:34:47 --> 00:34:53
I can even do that by heart.

683
00:34:49 --> 00:34:55
9-3-- .396, .406.

684
00:34:55 --> 00:35:01
Close enough.

685
00:34:56 --> 00:35:02
The two are
in excellent agreement

686
00:34:59 --> 00:35:05
within the 2½% uncertainty
in each measurement.

687
00:35:03 --> 00:35:09
So, you see, that's exactly
how you can demonstrate

688
00:35:07 --> 00:35:13
the conservation of momentum.

689
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
They picked up kinetic energy,

690
00:35:14 --> 00:35:20
but after the wire was burned,
the momentum remained zero.

691
00:35:22 --> 00:35:28

692
00:35:30 --> 00:35:36
Now I change the topic.

693
00:35:32 --> 00:35:38
It... it appears
that I change the topic,

694
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
but you will see in a few weeks
that it's really related--

695
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
not even a few weeks--

696
00:35:40 --> 00:35:46
you will see
that it's really related

697
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
to the conservation of momentum.

698
00:35:45 --> 00:35:51
I'm going to explain to you now

699
00:35:48 --> 00:35:54
what we physicists mean
by center of mass of a system.

700
00:35:54 --> 00:36:00
The center of mass of a system
is defined as follows:

701
00:36:00 --> 00:36:06
I have here some kind
of an object--

702
00:36:04 --> 00:36:10
not just a point mass,
but it has a finite size.

703
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
It could be a hammer.

704
00:36:10 --> 00:36:16
It could be something
like this-- a squash racquet.

705
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
And let the center of mass
be, for instance, here.

706
00:36:19 --> 00:36:25
This is the center of mass.

707
00:36:22 --> 00:36:28
I pick any origin I want to.

708
00:36:24 --> 00:36:30
You're totally free
to choose this origin--

709
00:36:28 --> 00:36:34
doesn't matter
where you take it.

710
00:36:31 --> 00:36:37
And this, now, is the position
vector of the center of mass.

711
00:36:36 --> 00:36:42
And now I carve out a zillion
little mass elements, m of i,

712
00:36:41 --> 00:36:47
covering the entire object,

713
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
and then this is
the position vector, r of i.

714
00:36:49 --> 00:36:55
And the center of mass
is defined as follows:

715
00:36:55 --> 00:37:01
the total mass of this object

716
00:36:58 --> 00:37:04
times the position vector
of the center of mass

717
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
is the sum, summed over i--

718
00:37:05 --> 00:37:11
over all these
little elements, i--

719
00:37:08 --> 00:37:14
times the position vectors of
the individual little particles

720
00:37:13 --> 00:37:19
that make up this object.

721
00:37:15 --> 00:37:21

722
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24
v center of mass-- I find that

723
00:37:21 --> 00:37:27
by taking the derivative
of this equation--

724
00:37:26 --> 00:37:32
equals one over the mass total.

725
00:37:29 --> 00:37:35
I bring this on this side,
I take the derivative here,

726
00:37:34 --> 00:37:40
and so here I get the sum
of m of i times the dri/dt.

727
00:37:39 --> 00:37:45
And so this is the sum
of i... of mi vi,

728
00:37:43 --> 00:37:49
simply taking
the first derivative,

729
00:37:47 --> 00:37:53
which changes positions
into velocities.

730
00:37:51 --> 00:37:57

731
00:37:53 --> 00:37:59
Now, this is also 1 over m total
times the total momentum,

732
00:37:58 --> 00:38:04
because I've all these momenta
of these individual particles.

733
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
They have a...
together, a total momentum.

734
00:38:09 --> 00:38:15
And so now you come

735
00:38:11 --> 00:38:17
to another very important
statement in physics,

736
00:38:14 --> 00:38:20
and that is that the total
momentum of an object--

737
00:38:18 --> 00:38:24
which could be a hammer, which
could be a squash racquet--

738
00:38:23 --> 00:38:29
is the total mass of that object

739
00:38:25 --> 00:38:31
times the velocity
of the center of mass.

740
00:38:29 --> 00:38:35
And if I take
the derivative of this,

741
00:38:34 --> 00:38:40
then dp/dt of
the total momentum--

742
00:38:39 --> 00:38:45
of which we learned that
the total momentum, dp/dt,

743
00:38:43 --> 00:38:49
is the total external force,

744
00:38:45 --> 00:38:51
we already learned
that earlier--

745
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
that now is the total mass
of the system

746
00:38:51 --> 00:38:57
times the acceleration
of the center of mass,

747
00:38:54 --> 00:39:00
because I take the derivative
of this equation.

748
00:38:57 --> 00:39:03
That gives me dP/dt here,

749
00:38:59 --> 00:39:05
and the velocity changes
to acceleration.

750
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
And look at this!

751
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
This is really an amazing
statement.

752
00:39:08 --> 00:39:14
This says F = ma.

753
00:39:10 --> 00:39:16
But if I have here
this squash racquet

754
00:39:12 --> 00:39:18
and here is the center of mass,

755
00:39:15 --> 00:39:21
then if I throw this object up
in 26.400, as I will do later,

756
00:39:19 --> 00:39:25
then the center of mass behaves

757
00:39:22 --> 00:39:28
as if all the mass
of the entire squash racquet

758
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
was right at that
center of mass.

759
00:39:28 --> 00:39:34
So the behavior of the center of
mass is extremely predictable,

760
00:39:32 --> 00:39:38
whereas the behavior of
the squash racquet is not.

761
00:39:36 --> 00:39:42
It may start tumbling.

762
00:39:38 --> 00:39:44
If the external force on
the squash racquet were zero,

763
00:39:42 --> 00:39:48
then it would continue to go
always with the same velocity,

764
00:39:46 --> 00:39:52
the center of mass.

765
00:39:48 --> 00:39:54
If I had here a hammer--
this is a hammer--

766
00:39:54 --> 00:40:00
and there were
no external forces--

767
00:39:56 --> 00:40:02
I would be somewhere
in outer space--

768
00:39:58 --> 00:40:04
and it would have
a certain velocity.

769
00:40:01 --> 00:40:07
Then the center of mass,
but only the center of mass,

770
00:40:04 --> 00:40:10
would have a velocity
that never changes,

771
00:40:08 --> 00:40:14
because if there's
no external force

772
00:40:11 --> 00:40:17
then there is only
a constant velocity.

773
00:40:14 --> 00:40:20
There's no acceleration.

774
00:40:17 --> 00:40:23
But the hammer itself
may be tumbling.

775
00:40:19 --> 00:40:25
A little later in time, the
hammer may have this position.

776
00:40:22 --> 00:40:28
A little earlier in time,

777
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
the hammer may have had
this position.

778
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
But the center of mass
is just one smooth motion.

779
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
That is very mysterious that
there is one and only one point

780
00:40:34 --> 00:40:40
in any one of us--
in you, in me, in any object--

781
00:40:38 --> 00:40:44
that the center of mass behaves

782
00:40:41 --> 00:40:47
as if all the matter
were together in one point.

783
00:40:45 --> 00:40:51
And so this is another
quite important statement:

784
00:40:49 --> 00:40:55
For the center of mass,
the total momentum

785
00:40:52 --> 00:40:58
is the total (no audio )

786
00:40:54 --> 00:41:00
...the velocity of
the center of mass.

787
00:40:57 --> 00:41:03
And you take the derivative
of that equation

788
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
and you get F = ma.

789
00:41:01 --> 00:41:07
And that means if
the external force is zero--

790
00:41:05 --> 00:41:11
you can go back
to the upper line again--

791
00:41:07 --> 00:41:13
if the external total force
is zero,

792
00:41:10 --> 00:41:16
then the momentum of the system
is conserved,

793
00:41:13 --> 00:41:19
and so the center of mass

794
00:41:15 --> 00:41:21
will then keep
its velocity unchanged.

795
00:41:18 --> 00:41:24

796
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
Let's do one calculation
to give you some experience

797
00:41:27 --> 00:41:33
on how you derive
the center of mass.

798
00:41:30 --> 00:41:36
I'll take a simple case.

799
00:41:32 --> 00:41:38
I won't take a hammer.

800
00:41:33 --> 00:41:39
It's a little bit complicated.

801
00:41:36 --> 00:41:42
I will take three masses
which are held together

802
00:41:41 --> 00:41:47
by very unphysical...
by massless rods, say.

803
00:41:46 --> 00:41:52
Then I have three point masses

804
00:41:49 --> 00:41:55
and that makes my life
a little easier.

805
00:41:52 --> 00:41:58
Let this be the Y axis
and this the X axis,

806
00:41:57 --> 00:42:03
and here at zero
I have a mass m.

807
00:42:00 --> 00:42:06
At a distance l,
I have here a mass 2m.

808
00:42:05 --> 00:42:11

809
00:42:08 --> 00:42:14
This is also l
and this is also l,

810
00:42:10 --> 00:42:16
so this is equilateral triangle.

811
00:42:12 --> 00:42:18
These are massless rods,
and here I have a mass m.

812
00:42:15 --> 00:42:21
And I'm asking you,
where is the center of mass?

813
00:42:20 --> 00:42:26
So you have three point masses,

814
00:42:23 --> 00:42:29
and they are connected
with massless rods.

815
00:42:27 --> 00:42:33
Well, for those of you who have
a good feeling for symmetry,

816
00:42:31 --> 00:42:37
they would say certainly it has
to lie somewhere on this line.

817
00:42:35 --> 00:42:41
And it's probably slanted
in the direction of the 2m,

818
00:42:38 --> 00:42:44
so it will probably
be somewhere here.

819
00:42:42 --> 00:42:48
And so this will be the position
vector r center of mass,

820
00:42:47 --> 00:42:53
and the individual
position vectors

821
00:42:50 --> 00:42:56
from the origin here
will be this,

822
00:42:53 --> 00:42:59
and this will be a position
vector to this object,

823
00:42:56 --> 00:43:02
and the position vector
to this object is zero.

824
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
And so now we can calculate

825
00:43:02 --> 00:43:08
the position of the center
of mass as follows.

826
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
We know that the total mass,

827
00:43:08 --> 00:43:14
which is 4m times the position
vector, r center of mass--

828
00:43:13 --> 00:43:19
I go all the way up there
on the blackboard; 

829
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
there's my definition
for center of mass--

830
00:43:20 --> 00:43:26
equals the sum
of the individual masses

831
00:43:23 --> 00:43:29
times their position vectors.

832
00:43:26 --> 00:43:32
So it is the sum of i
m of i times r i.

833
00:43:30 --> 00:43:36
And this i goes
from one to three.

834
00:43:34 --> 00:43:40

835
00:43:35 --> 00:43:41
Now, this is
a vectorial equation,

836
00:43:37 --> 00:43:43
and whenever we have a vectorial
equation, it sometimes pays off

837
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
to split it
into two components--

838
00:43:44 --> 00:43:50
a y and to an x component.

839
00:43:45 --> 00:43:51
And so in the x direction...

840
00:43:47 --> 00:43:53
of course,
the same equation holds

841
00:43:49 --> 00:43:55
for the x component
of these vectors.

842
00:43:52 --> 00:43:58
So now I have that 4m

843
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
times the x component
of the center of mass

844
00:43:58 --> 00:44:04
equals this mass

845
00:43:59 --> 00:44:05
times the x component
of its position vector,

846
00:44:03 --> 00:44:09
which is zero, plus this mass,

847
00:44:07 --> 00:44:13
which is 2m times
the x position, which is l--

848
00:44:13 --> 00:44:19
so plus 2m times l--
plus this mass

849
00:44:17 --> 00:44:23
times the x component of this
mass, which is one-half l.

850
00:44:23 --> 00:44:29
So that gives me
plus one-half m times l.

851
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
My m goes and so I get
that x center of mass

852
00:44:33 --> 00:44:39
equals 2½ divided by four.

853
00:44:38 --> 00:44:44
That is five-eighths l.

854
00:44:41 --> 00:44:47
So we were not too far off
where we put it.

855
00:44:45 --> 00:44:51
Now, in the y direction,
you can do exactly the same.

856
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
You can split it up
into the position vector

857
00:44:52 --> 00:44:58
of this object, which is
one-half l square root three.

858
00:44:57 --> 00:45:03
This one has no y component
and this one has no y component,

859
00:45:02 --> 00:45:08
so this is very easy.

860
00:45:03 --> 00:45:09
So you're going to get that 4m
times y of the center of mass

861
00:45:10 --> 00:45:16
equals this mass m

862
00:45:12 --> 00:45:18
times the y component
of that position vector,

863
00:45:17 --> 00:45:23
and that is one-half l
square root of three.

864
00:45:22 --> 00:45:28
And so you lose your m, and so
you see that y center of mass

865
00:45:27 --> 00:45:33
then becomes the square root of
three divided by eight times l.

866
00:45:33 --> 00:45:39
And I think that's about 0.22L,
very roughly.

867
00:45:37 --> 00:45:43
Yes.

868
00:45:38 --> 00:45:44
And so you see that
we didn't put it in so badly.

869
00:45:42 --> 00:45:48
It's about one-fifth
of this distance.

870
00:45:45 --> 00:45:51
It's about one-fifth higher
than this distance.

871
00:45:47 --> 00:45:53
And so you can calculate
the center of mass.

872
00:45:50 --> 00:45:56
That's really not too hard,
if you have discrete points.

873
00:45:53 --> 00:45:59
If you have a car or if you have
an object like this,

874
00:45:56 --> 00:46:02
then it is, of course,

875
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
much harder to calculate
the center of mass.

876
00:46:00 --> 00:46:06
I will teach you in a few weeks
a very easy way

877
00:46:03 --> 00:46:09
to determine experimentally

878
00:46:05 --> 00:46:11
where the center of mass
is located--

879
00:46:08 --> 00:46:14
experimentally,
which is different

880
00:46:10 --> 00:46:16
from calculating
it analytically,

881
00:46:12 --> 00:46:18
as we just did.

882
00:46:13 --> 00:46:19
So I mentioned to you that
the motion of the center of mass

883
00:46:19 --> 00:46:25
is very uniform in the absence
of external forces,

884
00:46:23 --> 00:46:29
and that I can demonstrate for
you again with the air track.

885
00:46:28 --> 00:46:34
We have a system here
of two cars

886
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
which I connected by a spring.

887
00:46:34 --> 00:46:40
I will turn on the air shortly

888
00:46:37 --> 00:46:43
because the air makes
a lot of noise.

889
00:46:40 --> 00:46:46
This is... these are two cars
connected by a spring,

890
00:46:45 --> 00:46:51
and I will give these cars
a certain motion

891
00:46:48 --> 00:46:54
and they will go
in this direction.

892
00:46:51 --> 00:46:57
And they will oscillate
in a weird way

893
00:46:54 --> 00:47:00
because they are connected
with a spring

894
00:46:58 --> 00:47:04
and I keep them connected.

895
00:47:00 --> 00:47:06
And it will be nearly impossible

896
00:47:02 --> 00:47:08
for us to evaluate the motion
of these two cars individually.

897
00:47:06 --> 00:47:12
But if I give the whole system
a certain velocity

898
00:47:09 --> 00:47:15
and then they go like this,

899
00:47:10 --> 00:47:16
and they keep going like this
and making crazy things,

900
00:47:13 --> 00:47:19
momentum of the center of mass
will not change--

901
00:47:17 --> 00:47:23
only of the center of mass.

902
00:47:19 --> 00:47:25
Not of this car,
not of that car.

903
00:47:21 --> 00:47:27
That's the uniqueness
of the center of mass.

904
00:47:24 --> 00:47:30
And so the center of mass
will just laugh at us

905
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
and ignore all these motions

906
00:47:30 --> 00:47:36
and will travel at
a constant speed very nicely.

907
00:47:33 --> 00:47:39
So if you concentrate
on that little object,

908
00:47:36 --> 00:47:42
you may be able to see that.

909
00:47:38 --> 00:47:44
You may need a lot of
imagination to see that,

910
00:47:41 --> 00:47:47
because you're going
to be distracted

911
00:47:44 --> 00:47:50
by the weird motion
of the other two objects.

912
00:47:47 --> 00:47:53
This is the center of mass.

913
00:47:49 --> 00:47:55
It's right in the middle.

914
00:47:50 --> 00:47:56
The objects have the same mass.

915
00:47:52 --> 00:47:58

916
00:47:54 --> 00:48:00
There we go.

917
00:47:55 --> 00:48:01

918
00:48:02 --> 00:48:08
You see how complicated
this motion is

919
00:48:05 --> 00:48:11
of the individual cars?

920
00:48:06 --> 00:48:12
Can you see that the center of
mass is moving very uniformly,

921
00:48:10 --> 00:48:16
or can you not see that?

922
00:48:12 --> 00:48:18
Oh, you think you can see that?

923
00:48:14 --> 00:48:20
You have a lot of imagination.

924
00:48:17 --> 00:48:23
But I will help you.

925
00:48:18 --> 00:48:24
I will turn on...
I will turn off all the lights

926
00:48:22 --> 00:48:28
and only turn on
ultraviolet light.

927
00:48:26 --> 00:48:32
And ultraviolet light
will interact

928
00:48:29 --> 00:48:35
with that little ball,
the center of mass,

929
00:48:34 --> 00:48:40
and when I then make it dark,

930
00:48:37 --> 00:48:43
you will only see the motion
of the center of mass.

931
00:48:42 --> 00:48:48
And then you can really see

932
00:48:44 --> 00:48:50
that the center of mass moves
in a very civilized way.

933
00:48:49 --> 00:48:55
I'll bring it out here again.

934
00:48:51 --> 00:48:57

935
00:48:58 --> 00:49:04
Okay.

936
00:48:59 --> 00:49:05
So now I'm going to help you
to concentrate.

937
00:49:02 --> 00:49:08
Are the timers off?

938
00:49:04 --> 00:49:10
Yes, timers are off?

939
00:49:05 --> 00:49:11

940
00:49:07 --> 00:49:13
Okay, dark.

941
00:49:08 --> 00:49:14
Let your eyes get used
to the darkness.

942
00:49:13 --> 00:49:19

943
00:49:19 --> 00:49:25
Okay, I'm going to do
the same thing,

944
00:49:22 --> 00:49:28
and now look at
that center of mass.

945
00:49:25 --> 00:49:31
And we know that these cars
are doing crazy things.

946
00:49:29 --> 00:49:35
Hard to predict but the center
of mass behaves decently.

947
00:49:36 --> 00:49:42
Beautifully!

948
00:49:37 --> 00:49:43
Constant velocity.

949
00:49:39 --> 00:49:45
I can let it go backwards,
so you can enjoy this once more.

950
00:49:44 --> 00:49:50

951
00:49:52 --> 00:49:58
Center of mass motion,

952
00:49:55 --> 00:50:01
in the absence of external
forces has a constant velocity.

953
00:50:03 --> 00:50:09
When I throw up a hammer,

954
00:50:06 --> 00:50:12
then the hammer will do
very weird things.

955
00:50:12 --> 00:50:18
The hammer will start
to tumble and rotate,

956
00:50:15 --> 00:50:21
but the center of mass will
behave in a civilized way.

957
00:50:20 --> 00:50:26
If I throw up a hammer,

958
00:50:22 --> 00:50:28
then the center of mass
and only the center of mass

959
00:50:26 --> 00:50:32
will just go along
a perfect parabola

960
00:50:29 --> 00:50:35
as if it were just
a tennis ball.

961
00:50:32 --> 00:50:38
Now at one point...

962
00:50:33 --> 00:50:39
I will do it
with a squash racquet--

963
00:50:36 --> 00:50:42
at one point the squash racquet
may be like this,

964
00:50:39 --> 00:50:45
and at another point, the squash
racquet may be like this,

965
00:50:42 --> 00:50:48
and a little later,
it may be like this,

966
00:50:45 --> 00:50:51
but the center of mass
of the squash racquet

967
00:50:48 --> 00:50:54
will perfectly go
along a parabola.

968
00:50:50 --> 00:50:56
And so we have here
a squash racquet

969
00:50:53 --> 00:50:59
and we have here
the center of mass.

970
00:50:55 --> 00:51:01
I have also here a regular...

971
00:50:57 --> 00:51:03
well, it's not quite
a tennis ball, but close enough.

972
00:51:01 --> 00:51:07
This one, you would expect it

973
00:51:03 --> 00:51:09
to behave perfectly
like a parabola.

974
00:51:05 --> 00:51:11
From this one,
you would not expect it

975
00:51:08 --> 00:51:14
to behave like a parabola.

976
00:51:09 --> 00:51:15
Let me throw this one up
in light,

977
00:51:12 --> 00:51:18
and you will see that it has
very strange motion.

978
00:51:15 --> 00:51:21

979
00:51:17 --> 00:51:23
If I show the whole thing in UV,

980
00:51:19 --> 00:51:25
then you will see the same kind
of beautiful parabola

981
00:51:22 --> 00:51:28
as you would see
with this ball--

982
00:51:23 --> 00:51:29
something like this.

983
00:51:24 --> 00:51:30

984
00:51:28 --> 00:51:34
Forget the fact
that it lights up.

985
00:51:30 --> 00:51:36
You remember it was
the last lecture

986
00:51:32 --> 00:51:38
that I wanted to remind you of.

987
00:51:34 --> 00:51:40
So now we're going
to turn off the lights

988
00:51:37 --> 00:51:43
and I want to show you the
motion of the center of mass.

989
00:51:41 --> 00:51:47
You see the center of mass here?

990
00:51:45 --> 00:51:51
Can you all see it?

991
00:51:47 --> 00:51:53
Okay, there we go.

992
00:51:50 --> 00:51:56
You ready?

993
00:51:51 --> 00:51:57
Concentrate only
on the center of mass.

994
00:51:53 --> 00:51:59

995
00:51:56 --> 00:52:02
Nice parabola or not?

996
00:51:57 --> 00:52:03
I'll do it again.

997
00:51:59 --> 00:52:05

998
00:52:02 --> 00:52:08
You see the center of mass?

999
00:52:03 --> 00:52:09
Can you see it?

1000
00:52:04 --> 00:52:10
You can still see it, right?

1001
00:52:06 --> 00:52:12

1002
00:52:08 --> 00:52:14
Wonderful parabola for me!

1003
00:52:10 --> 00:52:16
All right.

1004
00:52:11 --> 00:52:17
Enjoy the presence
of your parents.

1005
00:52:14 --> 00:52:20
Have a good weekend.

1006
00:52:15 --> 00:52:21
See you Monday.

1007
00:52:16 --> 00:52:22

1008
00:52:20 --> 00:52:26.000
