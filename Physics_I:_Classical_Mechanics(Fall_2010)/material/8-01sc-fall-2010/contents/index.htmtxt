***** Course Description *****
Physics I is a first-year, first-semester course that provides an introduction
to Classical Mechanics. It covers the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics,
fluid mechanics, and kinetic gas theory.
*** Course Format ***
===============================================================================
[Click_to_get_started.]This course has been designed for independent study. It
includes all of the materials you will need to understand the concepts covered
in this subject. The materials in this course include:
    * A complete set of Lecture Videos by renowned MIT Physics Professor Walter
      Lewin
    * A complete set of detailed Course Notes, replacing the need for a
      traditional course textbook
    * A complete set of Class Slides, with overviews and illustrations of the
      concepts and applications of the subject
    * Homework Problemsand interactive Concept Tests to gauge your
      understanding of and progress through the materials
    * Homework Help Videos in which Prof. Lewin takes viewers step-by-step
      through solving homework problems
    * Selected links to websites with related materials, including videos,
      simulations, and animations
    * An Online Study Group at OpenStudy where you can connect with other
      independent learners.
The content has been organized for linear progression through each of the
Course Modules, starting with Introduction to Mechanics and concluding with
Central Force Motion. It is a self-study course that you can work through at
your own pace.
