Mathematical induction 
Strategy: (1) Insert relevant deﬁnitions in the claim you want 
to prove. (2) Arrange a sequence for the induction. (3)
Formulate basis clause and inductive hypothesis. (4) Prove basis 
clause. (5) Prove inductive hypothesis by assuming its 
antecedent (n case) and deducing its consequent (n+1 case). 
Truth-functional completeness

Truth-functional 

completeness 

Truth-function: a mapping, for some positive integer n, from 
each combination of TVs n sentences can have to a TV. 
E.g. for two sentences: {T,F}X{T,F} → {T,F}. 
More generally: {T,F}n → {T,F} 
SL is truth-functionally complete iff for every truth-function f, 
there is an SL sentence P that expresses f. 
P expresses f iff P’s truth-table is the character istic truth-
table for for f

Truth-functional 

completeness 


We can state this more formally than in TLB: 
An truth-function f is a set of ordered pairs like this: 
{<<T,T>, T>, <<T,F>, F>, <<F,T>, F>, <<F,F>, F>} 
P expresses f iff for any i that is a member of f, when the 
atomic components of P are assigned the TVs in the 1st 
member of i, P receives the TV that’s the 2nd member of i.

Truth-functional 

completeness 

Why care? We want to use SL and truth-tables to test for TF-
truth, validity, consistency, etc. 
Suppose we couldn’t express some TF in SL, e.g. neither/nor. 
Then we would have no sentence of SL that expressed the 
same truth-function as ‘Neither Alice nor Bill can sw im.’ 
But then SL wouldn’t let us use a TT to show that the sentence 
is TF-entailed by {`Alice can sw im if and only if Bill can sw im’,
`If Alice can sw im, then Carol can’t sw im’, `Carol can sw im’}. 
Similar po ints apply to other truth-functions and tests for 

truth-functional properties and relations

Truth-functional 

completeness 


So we want to know that we can express every truth-function 
We know this because we can set out an algor ithm that, for 

any truth-function f, generates a sentence that expresses f. 

We can do this by focusing on each row of the TT that 

represents f, ﬁnding characteristic sentences for each

Truth-functional 

completeness 


Look at each value left of the vertical line in row i. (We’re 

go ing to pick a sentence for each value.) 

If the ﬁrst value is T, we pick A. If it’s F, we pick ∼A. 

If the second value is T, we pick B. If it’s F, we pick ∼B, etc. 

Form the iterated conjunction of all these sentences. 

This is the CS for row i.

Truth-functional 

completeness 

Repeat the procedure for other rows until you have a CS for 
each row 
Now ﬁnd a sentence P that expresses the TF represented by
the whole TT. Look at the values r ight of the vert line. 
If there are no Ts, P is any contradiction, e.g. A&∼A. 

If there is just one T, on row i, P is the CS for row i. 

If there are Ts on multiple rows, P is the iterated 
disjunction of the CSs for those rows.

Ex: Find a sentence that expresses the TF for 
this TT schema: 

( A&B)&C
( A&B)&∼C 
( A&∼B)&C
( A&∼B)&∼C 
(∼A&B)&C
(∼A&B)&∼C 
(∼A&∼B)&C
(∼A&∼B)&∼C 

There are Ts r ight of the vertical line on rows 3, 5, and 7. 
So we want an interated disjunction of the CSs for those rows. 
((( A&∼B)&C) v ((∼A&B)&C)) v  ((∼A&∼B)&C)

SD is sound iff if Γ  ⊢  P in SD, then Γ ⊨  P. 
Why do we care about soundness of SD? 
In do ing log ic, we care about truth. E.g.: If the sentences in Γ 
are true, must P be true? That is, are der ivations always

truth-preser ving? 

If we want to use a der ivation in SD of P from Γ to help us 
tell whether the truth of a g iven sentence follows from the 
truth of some other sentences, then der ivations in SD better 
be a guide to truth-functional entailment! 
I.e. it better be that if Γ  ⊢  P in SD, then Γ ⊨  P.

Soundness 


So how do we prove that if Γ  ⊢  P in SD, then Γ ⊨  P? 
Mathematical induction of course! 
Let’s start w ith a reminder of the deﬁnitions for ‘⊢’ and `⊨’. 

Γ ⊨  P iff every TVA that makes all members of Γ true also 
makes P true. 
Γ  ⊢  P (in SD) iff there is a der ivation (in SD) in which all 
the pr imary assumptions are members of Γ and P occurs in 
the scope of only those assumptions.

Soundness 


Let’s think now about the sequence on which we’ll use MI. 

A natural sequence to use is der ivation length. We could try: 
Basis clause: For any 1-line der ivation (in SD) in which all the 
pr imary assumptions are members of Γ and P occurs in the 
scope of only those assumption, Γ ⊨  P.

Soundness 


Then our inductive hypothesis would be: 
IH: If ( A) For any n-line der ivation in which all the pr imary 
assumptions are members of Γ* and Q occurs in the scope of 
only those assumption, Γ* ⊨  Q, then (B) for any n+1-line 
der ivation in which all the pr imary assumptions are members of 
Γ^ and R occurs in the scope of only those assumption, Γ^ ⊨  R.

Soundness 

But this won’t work! Explor ing why w ill help us understand why
the proof in the book goes the way it does. 
Suppose we’ve assumed ( A), the n-line case. 
Now we’re working on (B), the n+1-line case. 
In this situation, we’d like to be able to know that the nth 
line of the n+1-line der ivation is OK 
Then we’d just have to show that adding the n+1st line 
doesn’t get us into trouble. 
So we’d like to use our assumption ( A)... 
But this is where the proof hits trouble...

Soundness 

( A) doesn’t guarantee anything about the nth line in an n+1 line 
der ivation! (Why?) 
( A) For any n-line der ivation in which all the pr imary 
assumptions are members of Γ* and Q occurs in the scope of 
only those assumption, Γ* ⊨  Q. 
( A) only applies if the sentence on the nth line is only in the 
scope of pr imary assumptions! 
And in an n+1 line der ivation, the nth line might not be only in
the scope of pr imary assumptions. 
So ( A) doesn’t guarantee that in our n+1-line der ivation we 
didn’t already go wrong in getting to line n.

17 

Soundness 

So what do we do? We need ( A) to be stronger, so that it 
applies to the nth line of an n+1-line der ivation. (Compare our 
proof last time of 6.1E (1a).) 
So we make the inductive hypothesis stronger, and make the 
basis clause stronger accordingly. That’s why the proof in the 
book is as complex as it is! 
New basis clause: In any der ivation, if Γ1 is the set of open 
assumptions w ith scope over sentence P1 on line 1, then 
Γ1 ⊨  P1. 
Importantly, we’re NOT requir ing that the assumptions in Γ1 be 
primary assumptions.

New inductive hypothesis: If ( A) then (B). 
( A) In any der ivation, for every line i ≤ n, if Γi is the set of 
open assumptions w ith scope over sentence Pi on line i, then 
Γi ⊨  Pi. 
(B) In any der ivation, if Γn+1 is the set of open assumptions 
w ith scope over sentence Pn+1 on line n+1, then 
Γn+1 ⊨  Pn+1. 

Thursday, October 15, 2009 

19 

Soundness 

Now, prove the basis clause: 
In any der ivation, if Γ1 is the set of open assumptions w ith 
scope over sentence P1 on line 1, then 
Γ1 ⊨  P1. 
Since P1 is on line 1, P1 must be an assumption. 
And since every assumption is in its own scope, and there 
aren’t any other sentences before P1, the set of open 
assumptions w ith scope over P1 is just {P1}. So Γ1 = {P1}. 
Tr ivially, {P1} ⊨  P1, so since Γ1 = {P1}, Γ1 ⊨  P1.

Soundness 

Now let’s prove the inductive hypothesis by assuming ( A). 
( A) In any der ivation, for every line i ≤ n, if Γi is the set of 
open assumptions w ith scope over sentence Pi on line i, then 
Γi ⊨  Pi. 
Now suppose Γn+1 is the set of open assumptions w ith scope 
over sentence Pn+1 on line n+1. 
We need to show that Γn+1 ⊨  Pn+1. 
( A) entails that Γn ⊨  Pn, and similarly for every earlier line. 
So we only need to show that we didn’t go wrong in the step to 
line n+1.

Soundness 


Pn+1 on line n+1 had to be justiﬁed by one SD’s rules. 
So we can proceed by show ing that whichever rule justiﬁed 
Pn+1, the result is that Γn+1 ⊨  Pn+1. 
I’ll just go a couple of the rules. (The other cases are in TLB.) 
Suppose Pn+1 is justiﬁed by conjunction elimination applied to 
a conjunction Pn+1&R (or R&Pn+1) on line j. 
(or R&Pn+1) 
We know that since j < n+1, Γj ⊨  Pn+1&R 
So Γj ⊨  Pn+1. 

Thursday, October 15, 2009 

22 

Soundness 

Now, if Pn+1 is justiﬁed by the sentence on line j, then all the 
assumptions open at j must still be open at n+1. 
That means that Γj ⊆  Γn+1. So we can show that Γn+1 ⊨  Pn+1 
if we can prove the follow ing: 
(*) If Γj ⊨  Pn+1 and Γj ⊆  Γn+1, then Γn+1 ⊨  Pn+1. 
We can prove that easily: if a TVA me.m. Γn+1 true and Γj ⊆ 
Γn+1, then it me.m. Γj is true. So if every TVA that me.m. Γj 
true also makes Pn+1 true, then every TVA that me.m. Γn+1 
true me.m. Γj true, and hence makes Pn+1 true. 
So (*) is true. And we know its antecedent is true: Γj ⊨  Pn+1 
and Γj ⊆  Γn+1. So it follows that Γn+1 ⊨  Pn+1.

23 

Soundness 

Now we’ve made some progress on establishing (B) g iven ( A). 

(B) In any der ivation, if Γn+1 is the set of open assumptions 
in whose scope is a sentence Pn+1 on line n+1, then 
Γn+1 ⊨  Pn+1. 
For we’ve shown that g iven ( A), (B) holds whenever Pn+1 is 
justiﬁed by conjunction elimination. 
If we check all the other rules, then we’ll have proven g iven 

( A) that however we got Pn+1 from earlier lines, Γn+1 ⊨  Pn+1. 
So we’ll have proven (B) g iven ( A). So we’ll have proven the 
inductive hypothesis and ﬁnished our MI proof. 

Thursday, October 15, 2009

Soundness 

Suppose Pn+1 is justiﬁed by applying ∼I to lines h-k ≤ n+1. 
Then Pn+1 is of the form ∼Q, line h is Q, and lines j ≤ k and k 
contain some contradictory R and ∼R. 
Since j and k ≤ n+1, we know that ( A) applies to lines j and k, 
so Γj ⊨  R and Γk ⊨ ∼R. 
For ∼I to apply, we can’t have closed any assumptions between 
h and n+1 except Q. So we know that Γj-Q and Γk-Q are 
subsets of Γn+1. So Γj ⊆  Γn+1 ∪ {Q } and Γk ⊆  Γn+1 ∪ {Q }. 
But that means Γn+1 ∪ {Q } ⊨  R and Γn+1 ∪ {Q } ⊨ ∼R. 
So Γn+1 ⊨ ∼Q.
