Things  to  know  from  last  time: 
•	 Validity.  A(n)  . . . . . . . . . . . .  is  valid  iﬀ  . . .

•	 Soundness.  A(n)  . . . . . . . . . . . .  is  sound  iﬀ  . . .

•	 Connectives.  Molecular  /  compound  sentences.  Atomic  /  simple  sentences. 
•  Truth-functionality.  A  connective  is  truth-functional  iﬀ  . . . 
Also:  a  couple  things  we  didn’t  get  to  last  time: 
•	 Logical  truth  /  falsehood 
•	 Logical  indeterminacy 
•	 Logical  consistency 
•  Logical  equivalence 
The  plan  for  today:  Syntax  of  SL,  connectives,  truth-tables,  translation  issues. 
•	 The  symbols  of  SL:  A,  B,  C,  . . . ,  H7 , J3 ,  . . . , ∼, &,  ∨, ⊃, ≡,  (,  ). 
•	 A,  . . . , G34  are  atomic  sentences  or  sentence  letters 
•	 ∼  (or  ¬)  forms  a  . . .

It  corresponds  roughly  to  the  English  phrase  . . .

•	 &  (or  ∧)  forms  a  . . .

The  two  sentences  it  connects  are  . . .

It  corresponds  roughly  to  the  English  term  . . .

•	 ∨  forms  a  . . .

The  two  sentences  it  connects  are  . . .

It  corresponds  roughly  to  the  English  term  . . .

•	 ⊃  (or →)  forms  a  . . .

The  left-hand  side  is  the  . . .

The  right-hand  side  is  the  . . .

It  corresponds  roughly  to  the  English  terms  . . .


•	 ≡ (or ↔)  forms  a  . . . 
It  corresponds  roughly  to  the  English  terms  . . . 

The  set  of  sentences  of  SL  is  the  smallest  set F  such  that: 

• 

–	 Every  atomic  sentence  is  in F . 
–	 If  φ  and  ψ  are  in F ,  so  are ∼ φ, (φ &  ψ),  (φ  ∨  ψ),  (φ  ⊃  ψ),  and  (φ  ≡  ψ). 
•	 Truth-functional connectives correspond to functions  from truth-values to truth-values. 
–	 For  a  one-place  connective,  f  : {T , F } →{ T , F }. 
–	 For  a  two-place  connective,  f  : {T , F } ×{ T , F } →{ T , F }. 
•	 Truth-tables  illustrate  these  functions.  Fill  in  the  simple  truth-table  for ∼: 
A  ∼ A 

•	 A  two-place  connective  will  have  a  larger  truth-table. 
. . .  B 
A 
B 
A 

English  and  SL:  Translations  and  problems 
•	 Not  all  uses  of  English  connectives  are  (or  at  least  appear)  truth-functional. 
• 
‘And’
• 
• 

‘Or’

‘If  . . . then’.  In  SL: 
–	 Contraposition:  (A ⊃ B)  implies  (∼B ⊃ ∼A). 
–	 Strengthening:  (A ⊃ B)  implies  ((A &  B) ⊃ B). 
–	 (A ⊃ B)  or  (B ⊃ A). 
–	 ∼(A ⊃ B)  iﬀ  A  and ∼B.
