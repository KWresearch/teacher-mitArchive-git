Completeness of PD

Soundness recap

Last time we sketched a proof that PD is sound.
I.e., if Γ⊢P in PD then Γ⊨P.
The main part of the proof is proving that for any 
derivation:
        If Γi ⊨ Pi for all i≤k, then Γk+1 ⊨ Pk+1.
We prove this by show ing that it holds for each 
rule that could justify line k+1.

Soundness recap
The strategy for the individual cases goes like this:
Given the rule justifying line k+1, try to draw 
conclusions about the form of Pk+1.
Then draw conclusions about the structure of the 
derivation above line k+1 and about the forms of 
sentences on earlier lines, e.g. Qi and Rj.
Apply the inductive hypothesis to Qi and Rj.
Note the relationships among Γi, Γj, and Γk+1.
Draw conclusions about relationship between Γk+1 
and Qi and Rj.
Put this together w ith semantic deﬁnitions and 

Completeness
Next up: prove if Γ⊨P then Γ⊢P in PD
Remember the main strategy for completeness of SD. 
We argued that for sets of SL sentences:
Any C-SD set is a subset of a MC-SD set
Every MC-SD set is TF-C
Every subset of a TF-C set is TF-C.
So any C-SD set is TF-C.
We then appealed to connections between consistency 
and entailment and derivability.
We’ll have a similar strategy for PD.

Preliminary deﬁnitions

MC-PD: Γ* is Maximally Consistent in PD iff Γ* is consistent in PD 
and Γ*(cid:15470){P} is inconsistent for any P not already in Γ*.
(cid:15485)C: Γ is Existentially Complete iff for each sent. in Γ of the form 
((cid:15485)x) P, there’s a substitution instance of ((cid:15485)x) P in Γ, e.g. P(a/x).
ES sets: Set Γe is Evenly Subscripted iff it is the result of 
doubling the subscript of every i.c. in Γ.

↓Γ ⊬ P  
The ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} is C-PD       

Assume Γ ⊬ P. 
Then if Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} were IC-PD, then we could derive some 
Q and (cid:100)Q from Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P}.
And in that case, from Γ we could derive P by (cid:100)E, 
contradiction the assumption that Γ ⊬ P.
So Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} is C-PD.
Now we want to show that the ES variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} is C-PD.
So lets show that for any Γ, if Γ is C-PD, then Γe is C-PD.

↓Γ ⊬ P  
The ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} is C-PD

Suppose Γ is C-PD. Then Γe is the result of doubling the subscript 
on each individual constant in each sentence in Γ.
To show that Γe is C-PD:
Suppose, for reductio, that Γe were IC-PD.
Then we could derive some Q and (cid:100)Q from Γe.
And then a certain Q* and (cid:100)Q* would be derivable from Γ, 
contradicting our assumption that Γ is C-PD.

Let’s show how this reductio goes.

↓Γ ⊬ P  
The ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} is C-PD
Suppose, for reductio, that Γe is IC-PD.
Then there’s a derivation from members of Γe to Q and (cid:100)Q.
Halve the subscripts on each i.c. in the derivation, and you’ll end 
up w ith premises that w ill all be members of Γ.
The new sequence w ill be a derivation show ing that Γ is IC-PD.
(There’s a minor complication here that we’ll skip...)
This contradicts our assumption that Γ is C-PD.
So Γe is C-PD.
So for any Γ, if Γ is C-PD, then Γe is C-PD.
So since Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} is C-PD, an ES-variant of it is C-PD.

Then there’s an interpretation I’ that mem Γ and (cid:100)P true.
Now suppose for reductio that Γ ⊨ P.
Then every I that mem Γ true makes P true.
So I’ would have to make P and (cid:100)P true, which is 
impossible g iven the def. of (cid:100)
So Γ ⊭ P.

So if Γ⋃{(cid:100)P} is Q-C, then Γ ⊭ P.

This means every member of Γ⋃{(cid:100)P} is a member of Γ*.
Since Γ* is Q-C, there’s an interpretation I’ that mem Γ* true.
If every member of Γ* is true on I’, then since every member of 
Γ⋃{(cid:100)P} is a member of Γ*, every member of Γ⋃{(cid:100)P} is true on I’.
So every member of Γ⋃{(cid:100)P} is true on I’.
So there’s an interpretation that mem Γ⋃{(cid:100)P} true.
So by def., Γ⋃{(cid:100)P} is Q-C.

We know that the ES-variant of Γ⋃{(cid:100)P} is a subset of a Q-C set, 
since the ES-variant is (cid:15466) Γ* and Γ* is Q-C.
We’ll show that for any Γ, if the ES-variant Γe is Q-C, Γ is Q-C.
Since Γe is Q-C, some interpretation Ie mem Γe true.
Let I be just like Ie except that where Ie assigns objects to 
constants w ith even subscripts, I assigns the same objects to 
corresponding constants w ith their subscripts halved.
E.g., if Ie(a2)=John, Ie(a86)=Bill, Ie(c12)=France,
          I(a1)=John,   I(a43)=Bill,  I(c6)=France
Then each subscript difference b/t Γe and Γ is compensated for 
by a subscript difference between Ie and I.
So I says the same things about the same objects as Ie.

Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  

To prove: For any ES set Γe, there’s an MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ* such 
that Γe (cid:15466) Γ*.
So suppose Γe is ES and C-PD.
We’ll set out a procedure for building a big set around Γe, and 
then prove that the resulting set is MC-(cid:15485)C-PD.
As in our completeness proof of SD, the procedure w ill involve 
rules for constructing a series of sets Γ2, Γ3, etc.
Γ1 w ill be Γ. And Γ* w ill be the union of all sets in the Γ-series.

Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  
To build our sets, we use an enumeration of all PL sentences.
The rules for building sets are three:
If Γi (cid:15470) {Pi} is IC-PD:
Γi+1 is the same as Γi.
If Γi (cid:15470) {Pi} is C-PD, and Pi is NOT of the form ((cid:15485)x)Q:
Γi+1 is Γi (cid:15470) {Pi}
If Γi (cid:15470) {Pi} is C-PD, and Pi is of the form ((cid:15485)x)Q:
Γi+1 is Γi (cid:15470) {Pi, Q(a/x)}, where a is the alphabetically 
earliest constant not occurring in Pi or any member of Γi

And suppose in our enumeration, we have:
   Pn = ((cid:15485)x)Fx,  
   Pn+1 = Hb&Gb,  
   Pn+2 = ((cid:15485)x)(cid:100)Fx
Then Γn+1 = Γn = {Aa, Bb, ((cid:15484)x)(cid:100)Fx}
And Γn+2 = {Aa, Bb, ((cid:15484)x)(cid:100)Fx, Hb&Gb}
And Γn+3 = {Aa, Bb, ((cid:15484)x)(cid:100)Fx, Hb&Gb, ((cid:15485)x)(cid:100)Fx, (cid:100)Fc}

Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  

We can now prove that Γ*, the union of all sets in this sequence, 
is Maximally Consistent in PD and Existentially Complete.
First, we’ll show that Γ* is C-PD. 
If it were IC-PD, a ﬁnite subset would be IC-PD, since every 
derivation is ﬁnite.
Every ﬁnite subset of Γ* is a subset of Γn for some n. (?)
And every Γn is C-PD. This we can prove by mathematical 
induction.

↓
Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  

Basis clause: Γ1 is C-PD by hypothesis.
Inductive step: Suppose Γk is C-PD. 
There are three possibilities for Γk+1.
(1) Γk+1 is Γk, in which case it’s C-PD.
(2) Γk+1 is Γk (cid:15470) {Pi}. Rule 2 requires it to be C-PD.
(3) Γk+1 is Γk (cid:15470) {Pi, Q(a/x)}. Rule 3 requires Γk (cid:15470) {Pi} to be 
C-PD, where Pi is of the form ((cid:15485)x)Q.
But how do we know we can add Q(a/x) to Γk (cid:15470) {Pi}?

↓
Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  
By assumption, Pi is of the form ((cid:15485)x)Q and Γk (cid:15470) {((cid:15485)x)Q} is C-PD.
Assume Γk (cid:15470) {((cid:15485)x)Q, Q(a/x)} is IC-PD.
That means from Γk (cid:15470) {((cid:15485)x)Q, Q(a/x)} we can derive R and (cid:100)R.
But that means g iven Γk (cid:15470) {((cid:15485)x)Q} we can form a sub-derivation 
from assumption Q(a/x) to anything we want.
In particular, from Q(a/x) to (cid:100)((cid:15485)x)Q!
And then we can use (cid:15485)E to get (cid:100)((cid:15485)x)Q on the main scope line!
How do we know that’s permitted?
We already have ((cid:15485)x)Q, so we have derived a contradiction.

Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  

So we’ve proven our inductive step. Now we have:
Basis clause: Γ1 is C-PD by hypothesis.
Inductive step: If Γk is C-PD, then on any of the three ways 
Γk+1 could be formed, Γk+1 C-PD.
Conclusion: For every n, Γn is C-PD.

Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  

Now return to our proof that Γ* is C-PD.
We said if Γ* were IC-PD, a ﬁnite subset would be IC-PD, since 
every derivation is ﬁnite.
And every ﬁnite subset of Γ* is a subset of Γn for some n.
Now, since we just showed that every Γn is C-PD, we know that 
any subset of any Γn is C-PD.
So, since every ﬁnite subset of Γ* is a subset of some Γn, we 
know that any ﬁnite subset of Γ* is C-PD.
So there’s no derivation of any R and (cid:100)R from Γ*, since that 
would have to be from a ﬁnite subset that was IC-PD.
So Γ* is C-PD.

↓
Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  
Now we need to show that Γ* is maximal.
Suppose the contrary: There’s a Pk(cid:15476)Γ* s.t. Γ* ⋃ {Pk} is C-PD.
Since Pk is a PL sentence, it occurs kth in our enumeration.
By the def. of our Γ-sequence, Γk+1 = Γk ⋃ {Pk} if that’s C-PD.
Γk ⋃ {Pk} is C-PD.
Since if {Pk} were inconsistent w ith Γk, it would be 
inconsistent w ith every superset of Γk, e.g. Γ*. 
So Γk+1 = Γk ⋃ {Pk}   (...perhaps w ith a substitution instance)
But that means Pk(cid:15464)Γk+1, so because Γk+1(cid:15466)Γ*, Pk(cid:15464)Γ*.
Contradiction.
So there’s no Pk(cid:15476)Γ* s.t. Γ* ⋃ {Pk} is C-PD.   I.e. Γ* is maximal.

Any ES-variant of Γ (cid:15470) {(cid:100)P} (cid:15466) a MC-(cid:15485)C-PD set Γ*  
Finally, let’s show that Γ* is existentially complete.
I.e., that for each sentence in Γ* of the form ((cid:15485)x)Q, there’s a 
substitution instance of ((cid:15485)x)Q in Γ*.
So suppose ((cid:15485)x)Q is in Γ*. 
((cid:15485)x)Q is in our enumeration, at some position k. 
Γk ⋃ {Pk}, i.e. Γk ⋃ {((cid:15485)x)Q}, is either C-PD or IC-PD.
If it were IC-PD, then since ((cid:15485)x)Q is in Γ*, Γ* would be IC-
PD.
So Γk ⋃ {((cid:15485)x)Q} is C-PD.
