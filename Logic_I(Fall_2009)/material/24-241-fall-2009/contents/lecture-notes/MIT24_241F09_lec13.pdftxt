Compactness


A cool result of completeness: 
Compactness: Γ is TF-C iff every ﬁnite subset of Γ is TF-C.

So: a set Γ is TF-IC only if a ﬁnite subset of Γ is TF-IC. 
So, intuitively, there’s no TF inconsistency that you need an inﬁnite
number of SL sentences to get! 
Let’s prove compactness by proving each direction. 

Compactness


First, left-to-r ight: 
If Γ is TF-C, then every ﬁnite subset of Γ is TF-C. 
If there were a subset Γ- such that no TVA m.e.m. Γ- true, 
then there would be no TVA m.e.m. Γ true. 
Now, r ight-to-left: 
If every ﬁnite subset of Γ is TF-C, then Γ is TF-C. 
Equiv: If Γ is TF-IC, then some ﬁnite subset Γ- of Γ is TF-IC. 

Compactness

Assume Γ is TF-IC. Then there’s no TVA that m.e.m. Γ true.

So every TVA that m.e.m. Γ true makes some R&∼R true.

That is: Γ ⊨ R&∼R.

So by completeness, Γ ⊢ R&∼R.

But since every der ivation is ﬁnite,

 there’s a ﬁnite Γ’ ⊆  Γ such that Γ’ ⊢ R&∼R.

So by soundness, Γ’ ⊨ R&∼R. 

But no TVA makes R&∼R true.

So no TVA makes Γ’ true. I.e. Γ’ is TF-IC. 
So if Γ is TF-IC, then a ﬁnite subset of Γ is TF-IC. 

Limitations of SL

We want our formal language and der ivation system to help us 
prove that certain arguments are valid, that certain sets of 
sentences are inconsistent, etc... 
SL can’t do that for some arguments and sentences. 
Everything in the house smells bad.

Fido is in the house.

So, Fido smells bad.

Nothing has horns and also w ings.

Some animals at Neverland Ranch have horns.

All chickens have w ings.

So not all animals at Neverland Ranch are 

  chickens.
