The  vocabulary  of  PL 
•	 The  symbols  in  the  language  PL,  the  basic  building  blocks,  are: 
–	 Sentence  letters  of  PL:  A,  B,  C3 ,  . . . 
–	 Predicates  of  PL: A! , B! , C!!2 ,  . . . 
–	 Individual  terms  of  PL:  Individual  constants  of  PL  and  variables  of  PL 
∗	 Individual  constants  of  PL:  a,  b4 , c2 ,  . . . ,  v 
∗	 Variables  of  PL:  w,  x,  y3 , z1 ,  . . . 
–	 Quantiﬁers  of  PL: (∀x),  (∀z2 ),  (∃x),  . . . 
–	 And,  of  course,  parentheses  and  the  truth-functional  connectives  from  SL. 

Essentials  of  PL  syntax 

•	 Sentence :  An expression P  is a sentence of PL  iﬀ  P  is a  formula of PL and no variable 
occurs  free  in  P. 
•	 Formula :  An  expression  is  a  formula  of PL  iﬀ  it  can  be  formed  by  (possibly  repeated) 
applications  of  the  following  rules: 

1.  Every  atomic  formula  of  PL  is  a  formula  of  PL. 
2.  If  P  is  a  formula  of  PL,  so  is  ¬P. 
3.  If  P  and Q  are  formulas  of  PL,  so  are  (P&Q),  (P∨Q),  (P⊃Q),  and  (P≡Q). 
4.  If	 P  is  a  formula  of  PL  that  contains  at  least  one  occurrence  of  x  and  no  x-
quantiﬁer,  then  (∀x)P  and  (∃x)P  are  both  formulas  of  PL. 
•	 Atomic  formula :  An  expression  is  an  atomic  formula  of  PL  iﬀ  it  is  either  a  sentence 
letter of PL or an n-place predicate of PL followed by n individual terms (i.e.  variables 
or  individual  constants)  of  PL. 

Other  important  deﬁnitions 

•	 Scope :  The scope of a quantiﬁer is the (sub)formula of which the quantiﬁer is the main 
logical  operator. 
•	 Bound  variable :  An  occurrence  of  a  variable  x  is  bound  iﬀ  x  is within  the  scope  of  an 
x-quantiﬁer. 

• 
Free  variable :  An  occurrence  of  a  variable  is  free  iﬀ  it  is  not  bound. 
•	 Substitution  instance  of  P :  If  P  is  a  sentence  of  PL  of  the  form  (∀x)Q  or  (∃x)Q,  and 
a  is an  individual  constant,  then Q(a/x)  is a  substitution  instance of  P. The  constant 
a  is  the  instantiating  constant. 
•	 P(a/x)  is  the  expression  just  like  P  except  that  it  contains  the  individual  constant  a 
wherever P  contains  the  individual  variable  x. 

Essentials  of  PL  semantics 

•	 The main  semantic  notion  is  that  of  an  interpretation  of  PL. 
•	 An  interpretation  includes: 
–	 A  speciﬁcation  of  a  UD  (universe  of  discourse) 
–	 An  assignment  of  TVs  to  the  sentence  letters  of  PL 
–	 An  assignment  of  a member  of  the  UD  to  each  individual  constant  of  PL 
–	 An  interpretation  of  each  predicate  of  PL  (formally,  for  all  n,  an  assignment  of  a 
set  of  n-tuples  of members  of  the  UD  to  each  n-place  predicate  of  PL) 
•	 Interpretations,  like  TVAs,  oﬃcially  cover  every  individual  constant,  predicate,  etc., 
but  we  need  not  represent  all  that  detail. 
•	 By  “interpretation”,  we  will  unoﬃcially  mean  a  partial  interpretation  that  speciﬁes  a 
UD  and makes  assignments  to  all  elements  of  the  set  of  sentences  we  are  considering. 
•	 E.g.,  if we  are  dealing with  sentences  about  dogs,  and  speciﬁcally  about  Fido,  Sparky, 
Davy,  and  about  which  dogs  growl  or  chase  each  other: 

–	 UD:  The  set  of  all  dogs 
–	 Gx:  x  growls  (formally,  {x ∈ U D  | x  growls}) 
–	 Cxy:  x  chases  y  (formally,  {(x, y) ∈ U D2  | x  chases  y}) 
–	 f:  Fido 
–	 s:  Sparky 
–	 d:  Davy
