•	 Using  shortened  truth-tables  (STTs)  to  determine  the  TV  of  a  compound  given  TVs 
for  the  atomic  components.

A
 B  C  ∼(A  ∨ B) ≡ (C ⊃ A)

F

•	 Building STTs in reverse to determine whether a compound sentence can possibly have 
a  certain  TV.

•	 P  is  truth-functionally  true  iﬀ  . . .

Can  be  proven  by. . .

Can  be  refuted  by. . .

•	 P  is  truth-functionally  false  iﬀ  . . .

Can  by  proven  by. . .

Can  be  refuted  by. . .

Notions  and  notation  to  know 
–	 Curly  braces  for  sets:  {A,  B,  {C},  {C,  D},  . . . } 
–	 Set  union.  {A,  B,  C} ∪{ B,  C,  D} = 
–	 Variables  for  sets  of  sentences:Γ  n 
–	 The  empty  set:  ∅ or  { }. 
–	 Unit  /  singleton  set 
•	 Γ  is  truth-functionally  consistent  iﬀ  . . .

Can  be  established  by. . .

Inconsistency  of  Γ  can  be  established  by. . .

•	 A  set Γ of SL  sentences  truth-functional ly  entails  a  sentence P  iﬀ no TVA makes every 
member  of  Γ  true  but  P  is  false.  In  other  words,  P  is  true  on  every  TVA  that  makes 
all members  of  Γtrue. 
Notation:Γ  1  !  P. 
Also,  note:  ! Γabbreviates  ∅ ! Γ. 

•	 An  argument  in  SL  is  a  set  of  SL  sentences with  one  designated  as  the  conclusion  and 
the  rest  designated  as  premises.  E.g.:

A ⊃  ( B  ∨  C )

B ≡  C

∼  B

∼  A


Argument  (!):	

•	

is  truth-functionally  valid  iﬀ  no  TVA makes  P1 ,  . . . Pn  true  and  C  false. 

P1

.

Pn 
C 
•	 We  can  connect  truth-functional  entailment  with  truth-functional  validity: 
In  the  deﬁnition  of  truth-functional  entailment,  let  Γ  be  {P1 ,  . . . Pn},  and  let  P  be  C. 
P1

•	 Prove  that  Argument  (!)  is  valid  and  that  its  premises  truth-functionally  entail  its 
conclusion  by means  of  a  truth-table. 

is  valid  iﬀ  {P1 ,  . . . Pn}  truth-functionally  entails  C. 

•	 Thus,
