Completeness of PD 


Last time


We started to prove that PD is complete. 
We were working on proving that an ES-var iant of any
C-PD set is a subset of an MC-∃C-PD set Γ*. 
We set out a procedure for constructing Γ*, and 

proved that Γ* was consistent.

But there’s one thing I need to correct... 

Last time

Alex asked last time why we need to deal w ith evenly subscr ipted
sets. In my answer, I misidentiﬁed the reason. 
Our procedure for building Γ* inclu ded this clause: 
If Γi ∪ {Pi} is C-PD, and Pi is of the form (∃x)Q: 
Γi+1 is Γi ∪ {Pi, Q(a/x)}, where a is the alphabetically  
    earliest constant not occurr ing in Pi or any member of Γi 

I asked, how do we know we can add Q(a/x) to Γk ∪ {Pi}? 
The answer someone gave, and I agreed w ith, relied on the 

thought that ﬁnitely constants appear in any Γi and Pi.

We were wrong. 

Last time


Our main goal is to show that if Γ⊨P then Γ⊢P. 
We do *not* assume initially that Γ is ﬁnite --- that’s why 
compactness is an interesting result. 
So we do *not* assume that Γ⋃{∼P} is ﬁnite either! 
So Γ might contain inﬁnitely many constants. 

Last time


Now, in our construction of Γ*, we sometimes need to add Q(a/x)

to Γk, where a is a constant that isn’t in any sentences in the set.

How do we know this is possible? 
The answer explains why we bother transforming Γ⋃{∼P} into 
an evenly subscr ipted set. 
Let’s now turn back to proving that our construction of Γ* yields
a set that’s MC-∃C-PD. 
We proved that Γ* is consistent. Let’s now prove that it’s 

maximally consistent.


An ES-var iant of Γ ∪ {∼P} is C-PD 
↓ 
Any ES-var iant of Γ ∪ {∼P} ⊆ a MC-∃C-PD set Γ*  (11.4.4) 
Goal: Show that Γ* is maximally consistent. 
Suppose the contrary: There’s a Pk∉Γ* s.t. Γ* ⋃ {Pk} is C-PD. 
Since Pk is a PL sentence, it occurs kth in our enumeration. 
By the def. of our Γ-sequence, Γk+1 = Γk ⋃ {Pk} if that’s C-PD. 
Γk ⋃ {Pk} is C-PD. 
Since if {Pk} were inconsistent w ith Γk, it would be 
inconsistent w ith every superset of Γk, e.g. Γ*. 
So Γk+1 = Γk ⋃ {Pk} 
 
(...perhaps plus a substitution instance) 
But that means Pk∈Γk+1, so because Γk+1⊆Γ*, Pk∈Γ*. 
Contradiction. 
So there’s no Pk∉Γ* s.t. Γ* ⋃ {Pk} is C-PD.   I.e. Γ* is maximal.


An ES-var iant of Γ ∪ {∼P} is C-PD 
↓ 
Any ES-var iant of Γ ∪ {∼P} ⊆ a MC-∃C-PD set Γ*  (11.4.4) 
Finally, let’s show that Γ* is existentially complete. 
I.e., that for each sentence in Γ* of the form (∃x)Q, there’s a 
substitution instance of (∃x)Q in Γ*. 
So suppose (∃x)Q is in Γ*. 
(∃x)Q is in our enumeration, at some position k. 
Γk ⋃ {Pk}, i.e. Γk ⋃ {(∃x)Q}, is either C-PD or IC-PD. 
If it were IC-PD, then since (∃x)Q is in Γ*, Γ* would be IC-PD. 
So Γk ⋃ {(∃x)Q} is C-PD. 
But that means Γk+1 is Γk ⋃ {(∃x)Q, Q(a/x)}, for some a.

So if (∃x)Q is in Γ*, so is some substitution instance.

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Suppose Γ* is MC-PD and ∃C. 
We’ll ﬁrst prove some things about the membership of Γ*,
then we’ll g ive an interpretation on which every member is true. 
This w ill show that Γ* is Q-C. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

First, a helpful result:   Γ*⊢Q iff Q∈Γ*. 
Suppose Γ*⊢Q. 
Suppose Q∉Γ*. Then since Γ* is MC, Γ*⋃{Q} is IC. 
Then Γ*⋃{Q}⊢R&∼R. 
So by ∼I, Γ*⊢∼Q. 
So Γ*⊢Q&∼Q, contradicting the fact that Γ* is MC. 
So if Γ*⊢Q then Q∈Γ*. 
Now suppose Q∈Γ*. 
Then since {Q}⊢Q, and {Q}⊆Γ*,  Γ*⊢Q. 
So if Q∈Γ*, then Γ*⊢Q. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Now let’s beg in proving facts about the membership of Γ*.


Suppose P∈Γ*. 
Suppose ∼P∈Γ*. 
Then Γ* is IC-PD, contradicting what we’ve proved. 
So ∼P∉Γ*. 
So if P∈Γ* then ∼P∉Γ*. And contraposing: if ∼P∈Γ* then P∉Γ*. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Suppose P∉Γ*. 
Since Γ* is MC, Γ*⋃{P} is IC-PD. 
So Γ*⋃{P} ⊢  Q&∼Q. 
But then Γ*⋃{∼∼P} ⊢  Q&∼Q. So Γ*⋃{∼∼P} is IC-PD. 
So by ∼E, Γ* ⊢ ∼P. 
We proved that if Γ*⊢Q, then Q∈Γ*. 
So since Γ* ⊢ ∼P, ∼P∈Γ*. 

So if P∉Γ*, then ∼P∈Γ*. And contraposing: if ∼P∉Γ* then P∈Γ*.


If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

So, we have: P∈Γ* iff ∼P∉Γ* and, equivalently, P∉Γ* iff ∼P∈Γ*. 
Similar results parallel our proofs about SD, e.g.: 
P&Q∈Γ* iff P∈Γ* and Q∈Γ*. 
PvQ∈Γ* iff P∈Γ* or Q∈Γ*. 
P⊃Q∈Γ* iff P∉Γ* or Q∈Γ*. 
P≡Q∈Γ* iff P∈Γ* and Q∈Γ*, or P∉Γ* and Q∉Γ*. 

New results w ill concern quantiﬁed sentences and their 

substitution instances.


If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

To prove:  (∃x) P∈Γ* iff for some constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*. 

Suppose (∃x) P∈Γ*. 
Since Γ* is ∃C, there’s some a such that P(a/x)∈Γ*. 
So if (∃x) P∈Γ*, then there’s some a such that P(a/x)∈Γ*. 
Now suppose for some constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*. 
Since {P(a/x)} ⊢  (∃x) P and P(a/x)∈Γ*, we have Γ* ⊢  (∃x) P. 
We proved: Γ*⊢Q iff Q∈Γ*. 
So (∃x) P∈Γ*. 
So if there’s some a such that P(a/x)∈Γ*, then (∃x) P∈Γ*. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

So we’ve shown: (∃x) P∈Γ* iff for some constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*. 
We can prove a similar result for universally quantiﬁed sentences. 

To prove: (∀x) P∈Γ* iff for every constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*. 

Suppose (∀x) P∈Γ*. 
For any a, since {(∀x) P}⊢P(a/x), Γ*⊢P(a/x). 
We proved earlier that if Γ*⊢Q, then Q∈Γ*. 
So P(a/x)∈Γ*. 
So if (∀x) P∈Γ*, then for every constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Now suppose: For every constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*. 
Suppose (∀x) P∉Γ*. 
We proved that if P∉Γ*, then ∼P∈Γ*. 
So ∼(∀x) P∈Γ*. 
{∼(∀x) P} ⊢  (∃x)∼P, so Γ*⊢ (∃x)∼P. 
We proved earlier that if Γ*⊢Q, then Q∈Γ*. 
So (∃x)∼P ∈  Γ*. 
Since Γ* is ∃C, now there’s some a such that ∼P(a/x)∈Γ*. 
Then P(a/x)∉Γ*! Contradicts our assumption. 
So it’s not true that (∀x) P∉Γ*.       I.e., (∀x) P∈Γ*. 
So if, for every constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*, then (∀x) P∈Γ*. 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 
If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 
So here are our results about the membership of Γ*. 

P∈Γ* iff ∼P∉Γ*

P&Q∈Γ* iff P∈Γ* and Q∈Γ*.

PvQ∈Γ* iff P∈Γ* or Q∈Γ*.

P⊃Q∈Γ* iff P∉Γ* or Q∈Γ*.

P≡Q∈Γ* iff P∈Γ* and Q∈Γ*, or P∉Γ* and Q∉Γ*.

(∃x) P∈Γ* iff for some constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*.

(∀x) P∈Γ* iff for every constant a, P(a/x)∈Γ*.

This w ill allow us to prove that Γ* is Q-C by specifying an 
interpretation that makes all its members true. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Now recall, in proving the analogous result for SD, we just 

speciﬁed a truth-value assignment.

But interpretations for PL are more complicated, so we’ll need to 
do more. 
In order to g ive an interpretation that works, let’s ﬁrst remember

that can alphabetically enumerate the individual constants of PL.


For any n, we have constants at positions n, n+1, ... in our 

enumeration.

Each constant can be thus be associated w ith a different unique 
positive integer. 
a w ith 1, b w ith 2, ... v w ith 22, a1 w ith 23, ... v4 w ith 88, ... 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

I* w ill be the follow ing interpretation: 

UD = {n | n is a positive integer} 
For each sentence letter P, I*(P) = T iff P∈Γ*.    (Just like SD!) 
For each i.c. a, I*(a) is the integer associated w ith a. 
a: 1 
v4: 88

...

For each n-place predicate letter A, I*(A) inclu des all and only 
the n-tuples <I*(a1), ..., I*(an)> such that Aa1 ... an  ∈  Γ*. 
We’ll show that every member of Γ* is true on I*, by proving 
that for any sentence P of PL, P is true on I* iff P∈Γ*. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Our proof w ill be by mathematical induction on the number of 
OLOs in sentences. 
Basis Clause: For each sentence P w ith zero OLOs, 
P is true on I* iff P ∈  Γ*. 
Proof: P is either a sentence letter or atomic formula. 
If P is a sentence letter, I*(P)=T iff P∈Γ*, by def. of I*. 
If P is an atomic formula, then P is of the form Aa1 ... an. 
<I*(a1), ..., I*(an)> ∈ I*(A) iff Aa1 ... an  ∈  Γ*.   [by def. of I*] 
Aa1 ... an is true on I* iff <I*(a1), ..., I*(an)> ∈ I*(A). 
So Aa1 ... an is true on I* iff Aa1 ... an  ∈  Γ*. 
So if P has zero OLOs, P is true on I* iff P∈Γ*. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Inductive step: If for each sentence P w ith k OLOs, P is true on 
   I* iff P ∈  Γ*, then for each sentence P w ith k+1 OLOs, 
P is true on I* iff P ∈  Γ*. 
Proof: Suppose that for each sentence P w ith k OLOs, P is true 
on I* iff P ∈  Γ*. 
Then P has one of the follow ing seven forms:

∼Q, Q&R, QvR, Q⊃R, Q≡R, (∀x)Q, or (∃x)Q.

Thus there are 7 cases to test. 
The cases where P is a TF-compound are similar to cases we 
covered in discussing SD, so we’ll only cover one. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Suppose P is of the form QvR. 
To prove: P is true on I* iff P∈Γ*. 
Suppose P is true on I*. Then either Q or R is true on I*. 
Q and R each have k or fewer OLOs. 
So by the inductive hypothesis, Q is true on I* iff Q∈Γ*, and 
R is true on I* iff R∈Γ*. 
In each case, either Q∈Γ* or R∈Γ*. 
Earlier, we noted that QvR∈Γ* iff Q∈Γ* or R∈Γ*. 
So QvR∈Γ*.   I.e., P∈Γ*. 
So if P is true on I*, then P∈Γ*. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Now suppose P∈Γ*.   I.e. QvR∈Γ*. 
Now Q∈Γ* or R∈Γ*, since QvR∈Γ* iff Q∈Γ* or R∈Γ*. 
By the inductive hypothesis, Q is true on I* iff Q∈Γ*, and 
R is true on I* iff R∈Γ*. 
So either Q or R is true on I*. 
If either Q or R is true on I*, QvR is true on I*. 
So QvR is true on I*.   I.e. P is true on I*. 

So if P is of the form QvR, then P is true on I* iff P∈Γ*. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

We’ve supposed: 
For each sentence P w ith k OLOs, P is true on I* iff P ∈  Γ*. 
And we’re trying to prove: 
For each sentence P w ith k+1 OLOs, P is true on I* iff P ∈  Γ*. 
We’re working by cases, for each form P could have. 
Next we’ll turn to cases where P is quantiﬁed. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

Suppose P is of the form (∀x)Q. 
To prove: P is true on I* iff P∈Γ*. 

Suppose P is true on I*.  I.e., (∀x)Q is true on I*. 
Then for every a, Q(a/x) is true on I*. 
For every a, Q(a/x) has k or fewer OLOs, and hence by the 
inductive hypothesis, for every a, Q(a/x)∈Γ*. 
We earlier showed that (∀x) P∈Γ* iff for every a, P(a/x)∈Γ*. 
So (∀x)Q∈Γ*.  I.e. P∈Γ*. 
So if P is true on I*, then P∈Γ*. 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 
If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 
Suppose P is false on I*.   I.e. (∀x)Q is false on I*. 
(∀x)Q is false on I* iff for some ic a, Q(a/x) is false on I*. (?) 
(Every object in the UD of I* is named by some constant.) 
So for some ic a, Q(a/x) is false on I*. 
For every ic a, Q(a/x) has k or fewer OLOs, and hence by the 
inductive hyp., Q(a/x) is false on I* iff Q(a/x)∉Γ*. 
So for some ic a, Q(a/x)∉Γ*. 
Again, we know that (∀x)Q∈Γ* iff for every ic a, Q(a/x)∈Γ*.

So (∀x)Q∉Γ*.   I.e. P∉Γ*. 

So we’ve shown that if P is of the form (∀x)Q, 
P is true on I* iff P∈Γ*. 

If  Γ*  is MC-∃C-PD  then 
 

Γ* is Q-C   (11.4.8)  

 

I won’t go through the case for P of the form (∃x)Q, but the 

proof is similar. The completed mathematical induction would be:


Basis Clause: For each SL sentence P w ith zero OLOs, 

P is true on I* iff P ∈  Γ*.

Inductive step: If for each SL sentence P w ith k OLOs, P is true 
   on I* iff P ∈  Γ*, then for each SL sentence P w ith k+1 OLOs, P
   is true on I* iff P ∈  Γ*. 
Conclusion: For any SL sentence P, P is true on I* iff P∈Γ*. 
So there’s an interpretation that mem Γ* true. So Γ* is Q-C.
