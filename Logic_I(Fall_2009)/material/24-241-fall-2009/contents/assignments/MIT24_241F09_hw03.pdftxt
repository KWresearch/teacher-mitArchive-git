Logic  I

Problem  Set  3 
Due  10/6/2009 

1.  (12  pts.)  Use  a  truth-table  to  prove  that  the  following  argument  is  truth-functionally 
valid.  Be  sure  to  explain  how  the  truth-table  proves  that. 
∼ (C ∨ A)

∼ (C  ≡∼ A)

2.  Prove  that  the  following  derivability  claims  hold  in  SD. 
(a)  (10  pts.)  {(A ⊃ B )} %  [∼ B  ⊃∼ (A&D)] 
(b)  (12  pts.)  {(A ⊃ B ) ⊃∼ B }%∼  B 
(c)  (10  pts.)  {F  ⊃ (G ∨ H ), ∼ (∼ F  ∨ H ), ∼ G}%∼  H 
3.  (10  pts.)  Use  an  SD  derivation  to  complete  problem  5.3E  12(b)  from  TLB. 

4.  (10pts.)  Answer  problem  5.3E  13(a)  from  TLB. 

5.  (10  pts.)	 Answer  problem  5.3E  13(e)  from  TLB.  Note  that  the  problem  concerns 
validity  in  SD,  not,  e.g.,  truth-functional  validity,  so  be  sure  to  appeal  to  the  proper 
deﬁnition. 
6.  (14  pts.)  Derive  the  following  theorem  in  SD:  (A ⊃ B ) ∨ (B  ⊃ A). 
7.  (12  pts.)  Let  SD*  be  the  derivation  system  resulting  from  adding  the  rule Disjunctive 
Syllogism  to  the  rule  set  of  SD. Prove  that  in  SD, we  can  derive  anything  that we  can 
derive  in  SD*.
