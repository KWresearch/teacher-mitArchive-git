Question  1 
To  prove: 
•  ‘ ∼ (∃x)(F x & Gx)’  is  true  on  I .

Proof:

1. 	 ‘ ∼ (∃x)(F x&Gx)’ is true on I  iﬀ every variable assignment d for I  satisﬁes 
‘ ∼ (∃x)(F x & Gx)’  (by  the  deﬁnition  of  truth). 
2.  Let d0  be an arbitrary variable assignment for I .  d0  satisﬁes ‘∼ (∃x)(F x&Gx)’ 
iﬀ d0  does not satisfy  ‘(∃x)(F x & Gx)’ (by clause 3 of the deﬁnition of sat­
isfaction). 
3. 	 d0  does  not  satisfy  ‘(∃x)(F x & Gx)’  iﬀ  there  is  no  u  ∈  U D  such  that 
d0 [u/‘x� ] satisﬁes ‘(F x&Gx)’ (by clause 9 of the deﬁnition of satisfaction). 
4.  There  is  no  u  ∈  U D  such  that  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  ‘(F x & Gx)’  iﬀ  there  is 
no  u  ∈  U D  such  that  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  both  ‘F x’  and  ‘Gx’  (by  clause  4 
of  the  deﬁnition  of  satisfaction). 
5.  There  is  no  u  ∈  U D  such  that  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  both  ‘F x’  and  ‘Gx’  iﬀ 
there is no u ∈ U D such that �d0 [u/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈ I (‘F � ) and �d0 [u/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈ 
I (‘G� )  (by  clause  2  in  the  deﬁnition  of  satisfaction  (and  the  deﬁnition  of 
denotation)). 
6. 	 �a� ∈/ I (‘F � ) and �b� ∈/ I (‘G� ), so there is no u ∈ U D such that �d0 [u/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈ 
I (‘F � )  and  �d0 [u/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈ I (‘G� ). 
7.  So  d0  satisﬁes  ‘∼ (∃x)(F x & Gx)’  (by  2-6). 
8. 	 d0  was arbitrary, so every variable assignment d for I  satisﬁes ‘∼ (∃x)(F x&Gx)’ 
(by  7). 
9.  So ‘∼ (∃x)(F x & Gx)’  is  true  on  I  (by  1,  8). 
Q.E.D. 

Question  2 
To  prove: 
•  ‘(∀x)(F x ≡ Gx)’  is  false  on  I .

Proof:

1. 	 ‘(∀x)(F x  ≡  Gx)’  is  false  on  I  iﬀ  no  variable  assignment  d  for  I  satisﬁes 
‘(∀x)(F x ≡ Gx)’  (by  the  deﬁnition  of  falsehood). 

2.  Let	 d0  be  an  arbitrary  variable  assignment  for  I .  d0  does  not  satisfy

‘(∀x)(F x  ≡  Gx)’  iﬀ  for  for  some  u  ∈  U D,  d0 [u/‘x� ]  does  not  satisfy

‘(F x ≡ Gx)’  (by  clause  8  of  the  deﬁnition  of  satisfaction).

3.  There  is  some  u  ∈  U D  such  that  d0 [u/‘x� ]  does  not  satisfy  ‘(F x  ≡  Gx)’

iﬀ  there  is  some  u ∈ U D  such  that  either  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  ‘F x’  and  not

‘Gx’,  or  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  ‘Gx’  and  not  ‘F x’  (by  clause  7  of  the  deﬁnition

of  satisfaction).

4.  There  is  some  u  ∈  U D  such  that  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  ‘F x’  and  not  ‘Gx’  iﬀ 
there is some u ∈ U D such that �d0 [u/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈ I (‘F � ) and �d0 [u/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈/
I (‘G� )  (by  clause  2  of  the  deﬁnition  of  satisfaction  (and  the  deﬁnition  of 
denotation)). 
5.	 a  is  such  that  �d0 [a/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈ I (‘F � )  and  �d0 [a/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈/ I (‘G� ). 
6.  So there is some u ∈ U D such that �d0 [u/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈ I (‘F � ) and �d0 [u/‘x� ](‘x� )� ∈/
I (‘G� )  (by  5). 
7.  So  there  is  there  is  some  u ∈ U D  such  that  either  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  ‘F x’

and  not  ‘Gx’  (by  4,  6).

8.  So  there  is  some  u ∈ U D  such  that  either  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  ‘F x’  and  not

‘Gx’,  or  d0 [u/‘x� ]  satisﬁes  ‘Gx’  and  not  ‘F x’  (by  7).

9.  So  d0  does  not  satisfy  ‘(∀x)(F x ≡ Gx)’  (by  2,  3,  8). 
10.	 d0  was  arbitrary,  so  no  variable  assignment  d  for  I  satisﬁes  ‘(∀x)(F x  ≡

Gx)’  (by  9).

11.  So  ‘(∀x)(F x ≡ Gx)’  is  false  on  I  (by  1,  10).

Question  2 

Part  (a) 

The  mistake  is  in  line  3;  this  is  supposed  to  be  an  application  of  universal 
elimination,  but  the  sentence  to  which  the  rule  was  applied  is  not  a  universally 
quantiﬁed  sentence;  it  is,  rather,  a  conditional.  Universal  elimination  can  only 
be  applied  to  a  universally  quantiﬁed  sentence. 

Part  (b) 

The mistake  is  in  line  5.  One  cannot  apply  universal  introduction  to  a  sentence 
that  contains  a  constant  that  is  in  an  open  assumption.  The  sentence  on  line 
four  contains  such  a  constant  —  viz.,  the  ‘k’.  (The  sentence  on  line  1  is  the 
open  assumption  containing  ‘k’.  )  So  the  application  of  universal  introduction 
to  line  4  to  get  line  5  is  disallowed. 

3 

Part  (c) 
The  important mistake  is the one on  line 3:  the  incorrect application of existen­
tial  elimination.  Existential  elimination  brings  things  out  from  sub-derivations; 
you can’t use existential elimination  to go  from a  sentence on a particular  scope 
line  directly  to  a  sentence  on  the  same  scope  line. 
There  is  also  a  typo  on  line  4;  the  ‘∃’  shouldn’t  be  there.  But  this  is  not  the 
important  (or,  I  gather,  intended)  mistake.
