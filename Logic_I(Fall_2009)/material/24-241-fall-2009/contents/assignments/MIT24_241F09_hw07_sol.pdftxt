Problem  Set  7:  Answers 

Damien  Rochford 

Question  1 

Of  course,  there  a  lots  of  examples.  Here  are  the  ﬁrst  ones  that  came  to  my 
mind  that  weren’t  completely  uninteresting. 

Part  (a) 

Here’s  one: 

(∀x)(Rxx ⊃ (∃y)Rxy) 
(In  quasi-English:  ‘For  all  things  x,  if  x  bears  relation  R  to  itself,  then  there  is 
something  to  which  x  bears  relation  R.’) 

Part  (b) 

The negation of  the  sentence  above will do.  But  for variety’s  sake,  here  another 
example: 
(∃x)(F x&∼ F x) 
(In  quasi-English:  ‘There  exists  something  such  that  it  is  F  and  it  is  not  the 
case  that  it  is  F .’) 
This  one  is  pretty  uninteresting,  I  admit. 

Part  (c) 

This  pair  is  kind  of  interesting: 
(∀x)(F x ⊃ (A&∼ A)) 
∼ (∃x)F x 
(In  quasi-English:  ‘For  all x,  if x  is F ,  then  a  contradiction  is  true.’  ‘Nothing  is 
F .’) 

Part  (d) 

Voila: 

F a 
∼ (∃x)F x 
(In  quasi-English:  ‘a  is  F .’,  ‘Nothing  is  F .’) 
Not  something  you  need  to  know,  but  for  those  who  are  interested:  this 
pair  is  quantiﬁcationally  incompatible  in  PL.  However,  there  are  alternative 
languages  such  that  sentences  like  these  are  not  incompatible.  The  derivation 
systems  that  go  with  those  languages  are  called  ‘free  logics’. 

Part(e) 
Check  it  out: 
{(∀x)(∀y)(Rxy ⊃ Ryx), (∀x)(∀y)(∀z )((Rxy&Ryz ) ⊃ Rxz )} 
(∀x)Rxx 
(In  quasi-English:  {‘For  all  x  and  for  all  y ,  if  x  bears R  to  y ,  then  y  bears R  to 
x.’,  ‘For  all  x,  y  and  z ,  if  x  bears  R  to  y  and  y  bears  R  to  z ,  then  x  bears  R  to 
z .’},  and  lastly  ‘For  all  x,  x  bears  R  to  x.’) 
Again,  just  for  the  interested:  a  relation  R  is  what  is  called  ‘symmetric’  iﬀ 
the ﬁrst  sentence  in  the  set  above  is  true  of  it.  R  is what  is  called  ‘transitive’  iﬀ 
the  second  sentence  in  the  set  above  is  true  of  it.  The  last  sentence,  outside  the 
set,  is  true  iﬀ  R  is  ‘reﬂexive’.  What  I  am  claiming,  in  claiming  that  the  above 
set  entails  the  above  sentence,  is  that  every  symmetric,  transitive  relation  is 
reﬂexive.  And  that’s  true. 

Question  2 

Here  is  such  a  sentence: 

(∀x)(F x ⊃ Gx) 
There  is  no  equivalent  sentence  of  the  other  form  because  the  only  candidate  is 
the  string  of  symbols  (∃x)F x  ⊃  Gx,  and  that  is  not  a  sentence  of  PL  —  the 
third  ‘x’  is  an  unbound  variable,  and  no  sentence  of  PL  contains  an  unbound 
variable. 

Question  3  (7.8E,  part  2) 

There  is  more  than  one  way  to  do  each  of  these.  I  only  provide  one  answer 
to  each  question  here,  but  if  your  answer  is  something  else  that  is  obviously 
equivalent,  that’s  ok.  (If  you  answer  is  equivalent,  but  not  obviously  so,  that 
could  be  bad.) 

(c) 

∼ (∃x)(F x&E xp) 
The  main  logical  operator  is  the  ‘∼’. 

(h) 

(∀x)((F x&Ax) ⊃ (∃y)(E xy&(F y& ∼ Ay))) 
The  main  logical  operator  is  the  ‘(∀x)’. 

2 

(i) 

(∃x)(Ax&∼ F x&(∀y)((F y&Ay) ⊃ E xy))

The  main  logical  operator  is  the  ‘(∃x)’.


(n) 

(∀x)(∃y)Dxy&(∀x)(∀y)(Dxy ⊃ (Ax&∼ F x))

The  main  logical  operator  is  the  ‘&’.


Question  4  (7.8E,  part  5) 

Even more  ways  to  do  these.  Again,  as  long  as  your  answer  clearly means  that 
same  thing  as  what  I  have  written,  and  it  is  ﬂuent  Enlglish,  you’re  ok. 
I use  ‘number’ here  to mean  ‘positive  integer’  (as  it does,  in many contexts). 

(a) 
The  product  of  an  even  number  and  any  number  is  an  even  number. 

(h) 
There  is  an  even  prime  number. 

(n) 
If  one  number  is  larger  than  another,  the  second  number  is  not  larger  than  the 
ﬁrst. 

(r) 
There  is  an  even  prime  number,  and  every  prime  number  larger  than  it  is  odd.
