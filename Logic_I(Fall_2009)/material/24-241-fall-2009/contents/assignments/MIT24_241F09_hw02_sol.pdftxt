No,  it  does  not  follow.  Sometimes  it  is  the  case  that  there  is  truth-value  as­
signment  that  makes  P  true  and  one  that  makes  P  false,  and  a  truth-value 
assignment  that  makes  Q  true  and  one  that  make  Q  false,  but  there  is  no  one 
truth-value  assignment  such  that  both  P  and Q  are  true  on  that  assignment. 
An  example:  ‘A’  and  ‘∼  A’  are  both  truth-functionally  indeterminate,  but 
{ ‘A’,‘ ∼ A’ }  is  not  truth-functionally  consistent.

With  many  of  these  questions,  you  can  see  what  the  answer  is  without  con­
structing  the  truth-table.  You  need  to  construct  the  truth-table,  nevertheless. 
It’s  good  for  you. 
I’ve used the same conventions as the  last answers:  main connectives singled 
out  by  vertical  lines  around  their  columns,  numbers  at  the  bottom  to  indicate 
the  order  of  calculation.

You may  have  the  rows  in  a  diﬀerent  order —  that’s  ﬁne. 
As  you  can  see,  there  are  no  rows  such  that  all  of  the  premises  get  assigned 
T  and  the  conclusion  gets  assigned  F  (as  there  are  no  rows  such  that  all  of  the 
premises  get  assigned  T  at  all).  So  the  argument  is  truth-functionally  valid.

There is one row that assigns both premises true:  the �F , T � row (marked out 
by  horizontal  lines).  As  you  can  see,  that  row  assigns  T  to  the  conclusion.  So 
there are no rows such that all of the premises get assigned T  and the conclusion 
gets  assigned  F .  So  the  argument  is  truth-functionally  valid.

Ergh  —  one  of  the  sentence  letters  is  a  ‘T’.  Don’t  confuse  the  sentence  letter 
‘T’  with  the  truth-value  ‘T’  below. 
This  argument  is  truth-functionally  invalid.  Here  is  a  shortened  truth-table 
that  shows  that.

No,  it  does  not  follow.  Here  is  a  counterexample.  Let  P=A ∨ B ,  Q=A,  R=B . 
{ ‘A  ∨  B � }  truth-funcitonally  entails  A  ∨  B ,  obviously.  { ‘A  ∨  B � }  does  not 
truth-functionally  entail  A  (consider  A  false,  B  true),  and  it  does  not  truth-
functionally  entail  B  (consider  A  true,  B  false).

Throughout  this  section,  when  I  say  something  like  ‘there  is  no  truth-value 
assignment  such  that’  blah,  what  I  mean  is  ‘there  is  no  truth-value  assignment 
such  that,  on  that  assignment’  blah. 

2b 
Γ |= �P ⊃ Q� iﬀ there is no truth-value assignment such that every member of Γ 
is true and �P ⊃ Q� is false.  There is no truth-value assignment such that every 
member  of  Γ  is  true  and  �P ⊃ Q�  is  false  iﬀ  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment 
such  that  every member  of  Γ  is  true, P  is  true  and Q  is  false  (by  the  deﬁnition 
of ‘⊃’).  There is no truth-value assignment such that every member of Γ is true, 
P  is  true  and  Q  is  false  iﬀ  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every 
member  of  Γ ∪ {P}  is  true  and  Q  is  false.  There  is  no  truth-value  assignment 
such  that  every  member  of  Γ ∪ {P}  is  true  and  Q  is  false  iﬀ  Γ ∪ {P}  =  Q. 
|
Therefore,  Γ |= �P ⊃ Q�  iﬀ  Γ ∪ {P} |= Q. 
Q.E.D. 

3b 
Suppose  Γ  |= P  and  Γ  |= �∼ P�.  Then 
(1)  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every member  of Γ  is  true  and 
P  is  false,  and 

(2)  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every member  of Γ  is  true  and 
∼ P  is  false. 
By  (2)  (and  the  deﬁnition  of  ‘∼’),  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that 
every member of Γ  is  true and P  is  true.  From  this and  (1)  it  follows  that  there 
is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every member  of  Γ  is  true  and P  is  true 
and  there  is no  truth-value assignment  such  that  every member of Γ  is  true and 
P  is  false.  But  if  there  is  any  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every  member 
of  Γ  is  true,  it  is  either  such  that  every member  of  Γ  is  true  and  P  is  true  or  it 
is  such  that  every member of Γ  is  true and P  is  false.  So  there  is no  truth-value 
assignment  such  that  every  member  of  Γ  is  true.  So  Γ  is  truth-functionally 
inconsistent. 
So  if  Γ  |= P  and  Γ  |= �∼ P�,  then  Γ  is  truth-functionally  inconsistent. 
Q.E.D. 

4a 
Suppose  {P} |= Q,  and  {�∼ P�} |= R.  Then 
(1)  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  P  is  true  and Q  is  false,  and 
(2)  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  ∼ P  is  true  and R  is  false.

By  (2)  (and  the  deﬁnition  of  ‘∼’), 
(3)  there  is  no  truth  value  assignment  such  that  P  is  false  and R  is  false. 

Now,  every  truth-value assignment  is  either  such  that Q  is  true or  such  that 
Q  is  false.  So,  by  (1), 

(4)  if  a  truth-value  assignment  is  such  that  P  is  true,  it  is  such  that Q  is  true. 

And  every  truth-value  assignment  is  either  such  that  R  is  true  or  is  such  that 
R  is  false.  So,  by  (3) 

(5)  if  a  truth-value  assignment  is  such  that  P  is  false,  then  it  is  such  that R  is 
true. 

But  every  truth-value  assignment  is  either  such  that  P  is  true  or  such  that 
P  is  false.  So,  by  (4)  and  (5),  every  truth-value  assignment  is  either  such  that 
Q  is  true  or  such  that R  is  true.  So  (by  the  deﬁnition  of  ‘∨’),  every  truth-value 
assignment  is  such  that  �Q ∨ R�  is  true.  So  �Q ∨ R�  is  truth-functionally  true. 
So  if  {P} |= Q,  and  {�∼ P�} |= R,  then  �Q ∨ R�  is  truth-functionally  true. 
Q.E.D. 

4c 
Suppose  Γ  |= P  and  Γ�  |= Q.  Then 
(1)  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every member  of Γ  is  true  and 
P  is  false,  and 
(2)  there  is no  truth value assignment  such  that every member of Γ�  is  true and 
Q  is  false. 
By  (1),  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every  member  of  Γ ∪ Γ�  is 
true  and  P  is  false.  And  by  (2),  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that 
every member of Γ ∪ Γ�  is  true and Q  is  false.  So  (by  the deﬁnition of  ‘&’)  there 
is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  Γ ∪ Γ�  is  true  and  �P&Q�  is  false.  So 
Γ ∪ Γ�  |= �P&Q�. 
So,  if  Γ  |= P  and  Γ�  |= Q,  then  Γ ∪ Γ�  |= �P&Q�.
