Question  1 

The  trickiest  things  about  this  question  is  just  stating  what  you  want  to  prove 
in  the  right  way. 
Let  Q1 , Q2 , . . . , Qn  be  atomic  sentences.  Let  v(R)  be  the  truth  value  as­
signed  to R by  truth-value assignment v .  Let �(. . . (P1&P2 )& . . . &Pn )� be  the 
sentence  such  that  Pi  = Qi  iﬀ  v(Qi ) = T ,  Pi  = �∼ Qi �  iﬀ  v(Qi ) = F . 
Showing  that  a  sentence  constructed  in  accordance  with  the  characteristic 
sentence algorithm in TLB is, indeed, a characteristic sentence for the row of the 
truth-function  schema  in  question  is  equivalent  to  showing  that  a  truth-value 
assignment makes �(. . . (P1&P2 )& . . . &Pn )� true if and only if that truth-value 
assignment  assigns  truth-values  to  the  relevant  atomic  sentences  in  the  way 
that  v  does.  (You  should  think  of  v  as  the  truth-value  assignment  that  assigns 
truth-values  in  the  way  indicated  by  the  row  of  the  truth-function  schema  in 
question.)  Another  way  of  saying  this:  u(�(. . . (P1&P2 )& . . . &Pn )�) =  T  iﬀ 
u(Qi ) = v(Qi ),  for  all  i. 
So  what  we  want  to  show  is  that  u(�(. . . (P1&P2 )& . . . &Pn )�) =  T  iﬀ 
u(Qi ) = v(Qi ),  for  all  i. 
Here’s  a  proof: 
1.  By  the  fact  in  6.1E  (1d),  u(�(. . . (P1&P2 )& . . . &Pn )�) =  T  iﬀ  u(P1 ) = 
u(P2 ) = . . . = u(Pn ) = T . 
2. 	 u(P1 ) = u(P2 ) = . . . = u(Pn ) = T  iﬀ  both 
(a)  for  all  i  such  that  Pi  = Qi ,  u(Pi ) = T ,  and 
(b)  for  all  i  such  that  Pi  = �∼ Qi �,  u(Pi ) = T 
(as  all  i  are  either  such  that  Pi  = Qi ,  or  such  that  Pi  = �∼ Qi �). 
3.  Now,  2(a)  is  true  iﬀ  for  all  Pi  =  Qi ,  u(Qi ) =  T ,  obviously,  and  2(b)  is 
true  iﬀ  for  all  i  such  that  Pi  =  �∼ Qi �,  u(Qi ) =  F  (by  the  deﬁnition  of 
‘ ∼’). 
4.  So  u(P1 ) = u(P2 ) = . . . = u(Pn ) = T  iﬀ  both 
(a)  for  all  Pi  = Qi ,  u(Qi ) = T 
(b)  for  all  i  such  that  Pi  = �∼ Qi �,  u(Qi ) = F . 
(by  2,  3). 

5.  But  for  all	 i  such  that  Pi  =  Qi ,  v(Q1 ) =  T ,  and  for  all  i  such  that 
Pi  = �∼ Qi �,  v(Qi ) = F  (by  the  deﬁnition  of  v  above). 
6.  So  u(P1 ) =  u(P2 ) =  . . .  =  u(Pn ) =  T  iﬀ,  u(Qi ) =  v(Qi ),  for  all  i  (from 
4,  5). 
7.  So  u(�(. . . (P1&P2 )& . . . &Pn )�) = T  iﬀ  u(Qi ) = v(Qi )  (from  1,  6).

Question  2 

Let  Γ  be  the  set  of  atomic  sentences. 
Let  L1  be  the  set  of  all  sentences  P  such  that  P ∈ L1  iﬀ 
(a)  P ∈ Γ,  or 
(b)  P  is  of  one  of  the  following  forms: 
(i)  �∼ Q�; 
(ii)  �Q&R�; 
(iii)  �Q ∨ R�; 
where Q, R ∈ L1 . 
Let  L2  be  the  set  of  all  sentences  P  such  that 
(a)  P ∈ Γ,  or 
(b)  P  is  of  the  form  �Q ↓ R�,  where Q, R ∈ L2 . 
We know that { ‘ ∼’,‘&’,‘∨ ’ } is TF-complete, so we know that for every truth-
function,  there  is  a  sentence  in  L1  that  expresses  that  truth-function.  If,  for 
every  sentence  P ∈ L1 ,  there  is  a  sentence  in  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth 
function  as  P,  then  it  follows  that  for  every  truth-function,  there  is  a  sentence 
in  L2  that  expresses  that  truth-function,  from  which  it  follows  that  { ‘ ’ }  is 
↓ 
TF-complete. 
So, all that remains to be done to prove that { ‘ ’ } is TF-complete is to prove 
↓
that for every sentence P ∈ L1 , there is a sentence in L2  that expresses the same 
truth  function  as  P.

I  prove  this  by mathematical  induction.

Basis  Clause:  For  every  atomic  sentence P ∈ L1  there  is  a  sentence  in L2  that  expresses 
the  same  truth  function  as  P. 
Inductive  Step:  If,  for  every  sentence  P ∈ L1  containing  n  or  fewer  connectives  there  is  a 
sentence  in L2  that expresses the same truth-function as P,  then  for every 
sentence  Q  ∈  L1  containing  n + 1  connectives  there  is  a  sentence  in  L2 
that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as  L2 . 

Clearly,  it  follows  from  Basis  Clause  and  Inductive  Step  that  for  every 
sentence P ∈ L1 , there is a sentence in L2  that expresses the same truth function 
as  P. 
The proof of  Basis  Clause  is  immediate;  for every atomic  sentence P ∈ L1 
there  is a sentence  in L2  that expresses the same truth  function as P — namely, 
P.  (Besides,  every  atomic  sentence  expresses  the  same  truth-function:  the  one 
that  maps  true  to  true  and  false  to  false.) 
Now  for  Inductive  Step.  Consider  an  arbitrary  sentence Q ∈ L1  contain­
ing  n + 1  connectives.  Q  is  either  of  the  form 

2 

(a)  �∼ R�,  or 
(b)  �R&S�,  or 
(c)  �R ∨ S�.

I  prove  Inductive  Step  for  each  case  in  turn.


Case  (a): 
1.  Suppose that,  for every sentence P ∈ L1  containing n or fewer connectives 
there  is a  sentence  in L2  that expresses  the  same  truth-function as P  (i.e., 
suppose  the  antecedent  of  Inductive  Step). 
2.  Then  there  is  a  sentence  in  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as 
R  (as R  contains  n  connectives).  Call  that  sentence  in  L2  T. 
3.  I  claim  that  �T ↓ T�  expresses  the  same  truth-funciton  as  �∼ R�.  Here’s 
a  sub-proof  of my  claim: 
(i)  A  truth-value  assignment makes  �∼ R�  true  iﬀ  it makes R  false  (by 
deﬁntion  of  ‘∼’). 
(ii)  A  truth-value  assignment makes R  false  iﬀ  it makes  T  false  (by  2). 
↓
(iii)  A  truth-value  assignment  makes  T  false  iﬀ  it  makes  �T T�  true 
↓
(by  the deﬁnition  of  ‘ ’.  I  leave  the  veriﬁcation  of  this  as  an  exercise 
for  the  reader). 
(iv)  So  a  truth-value  assignment makes  �∼ R�  true  iﬀ  it makes  �T ↓ T� 
true. 
(v)  So  �∼ R�  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as  �T ↓ T�. 
4. 	 �T ↓ T� ∈ L2  (by  the  deﬁnition  of  L2 ). 
5.  So  there  exists  a  sentence  of L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as 
�∼ R�. 
6.  So,  assuming  the  antecedent  of	 Inductive  Step,  for  every  sentence  of 
the  form  �∼  R�,  where  R  has  n  connectives,  there  is  a  sentence  in  L2 
that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as  �∼ R�. 
That  proves  Inductive  Step  for  case  (a). 

Case  (b): 
1.  Suppose that,  for every sentence P ∈ L1  containing n or fewer connectives 
there  is a  sentence  in L2  that expresses  the  same  truth-function as P  (i.e., 
suppose  the  antecedent  of  Inductive  Step). 
2.  Then  there  is  a  sentence  in  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as 
R  and  a  sentence  of  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as  S  (as 
both  R  and  S  contain  n  or  fewer  connectives).  Call  those  sentence  in  L2 
T  and U,  respectively.

3.  I  claim  that  �(T T)
(U U)�  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as 
�R&S�.  Here’s  a  sub-proof  of my  claim: 
(i)  A  truth-value  assignment  makes	 �R&S�  true  iﬀ  it  makes  both  R 
and  S  true  (by  deﬁntion  of  ‘&’). 
(ii)  A truth-value assignment makes both R and S true  iﬀ  it makes both 
T  and U  true  and  it  (by  2). 
(iii)  A  truth-value  assignment  makes  both	 T  and  U  true  iﬀ  it  makes

�(T T)
(U U)�  true  (by  the  deﬁnition  of  ‘  ’.  I  leave  the

(iv)  So  a  truth-value  assignment  makes  �R&S�  true  iﬀ  it  makes  �(T

(U U)�  true. 
T)
↓
(v)  So  �R&S�  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as  �(T T)
U)�.	
4.	 �(T ↓ T) ↓ (U ↓ U)� ∈ L2  (by  the  deﬁnition  of  L2 ). 
5.  So  there  exists  a  sentence  in L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as 
�R&S�. 
6.  So, assuming the antecedent of  Inductive Step, for every sentence of the 
form  �R&S�,  where R, S  have  n  or  fewer  connectives,  there  is  a  sentence 
in  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as  �R&S�. 
That  proves  Inductive  Step  for  case  (b).

Case  (c):

there  is a  sentence  in L2  that expresses  the  same  truth-function as P  (i.e., 
suppose  the  antecedent  of  Inductive  Step). 

2.  Then  there  is  a  sentence  in  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as 
R  and  a  sentence  of  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as  S  (as 
both  R  and  S  contain  n  or  fewer  connectives).  Call  those  sentence  in  L2 
T  and U,  respectively.

3.  I  claim  that  �(T U)
(T U)�  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as 
�R ∨ S�.  Here’s  a  sub-proof  of my  claim: 
(i)  A  truth-value  assignment  makes  �R ∨ S�  true  iﬀ  it  does  not  make 
both R  and  S  false  (by  deﬁntion  of  ‘∨’). 
(ii)  A  truth-value  assignment  does  not  make  both  R  and  S  false  iﬀ  it 
does  not make  both  T  and U  false  and  it  (by  2).

5.  So  there  exists  a  sentence  in L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as 
�R&S�. 
6.  So, assuming the antecedent of  Inductive Step, for every sentence of the 
form  �R ∨ S�, where R, S have n  or  fewer  connectives,  there  is  a  sentence 
in  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth-function  as  �R ∨ S�. 
That  proves  Inductive  Step  for  case  (c). 
And  that  ﬁnishes  the  proof  of  Inductive  Step 
And that ﬁnishes the proof that for every sentence P ∈ L1 , there is a sentence 
in  L2  that  expresses  the  same  truth  function  as  P. 
And  that  ﬁnishes  the  proof  that  { ‘ ’ }  is  TF-complete.

Question  3 

There  are,  in  fact,  two  ways  to  use  the  proof  that  SD  is  sound  to  prove  that 
SD�  is  sound.  One  way  is  to  show  that  if  Γ � P  in  SD� ,  then  Γ � P  in  SD,  so, 
by  the  soundness  of  SD,  if  Γ � P  in  SD� ,  then  Γ |= P —  i.e.,  SD�  is  sound. 
I’m  going  to  do  it  the  other  way,  which  is  the  way  I  think  the  question 
prompt  is  nudging  you.  The  other  way  goes  as  follows. 
The  goal  is  to  prove  that  SD�  is  sound;  i.e.,  that. . . 
SD�  Soundness:  If Γ � P  in  SD� ,  then  Γ |= P 
. . . is  true.  We  are  going  to  prove  it  by mathematical  induction.  Let  Pk  be  the 
kth  sentence  in  an  SD�  derivation,  and  let  Γk  be  the  set  of  assumptions  open 
on  the  kth  line  of  that  SD�  derivation.  Clearly,  SD�  Soundness  follows  from 
the  following: 
Basis  Clause: Γ1  |= P1 . 
Inductive  Step:  If Γk+1  � Pk+1  in  SD� ,  then  Γk+1  |= Pk+1 . 
The  proof  of  Base  Case  is  exactly  the  same  as  the  proof  for  the  analogous 
base  case  in  TLB  on  page  260,  which  is  part  of  the  proof  of  the  soundness 
of  SD.  The  proof  of  Inductive  Step  is  exactly  the  same  as  the  proof  of  the 
analogous inductive step on pages 260-264 of TLB, which is also part of the proof 
of  soundness  of  SD,  except  you  need  to  add  a  case  for  Backwards  Conditional 
Introduction. 
One  way  for  that  case  to  go  is  as  follows: 

5 

Case  13:  Pk+1  is  justiﬁed by Backwards Conditional  Introduction: 
∼ R 
h 
∼ Q 
j 
h-j, B⊃I 
R ⊃ Q  (= Pk+1 ) 
k + 1 
1.  By  exactly  the  same  proof  as  in  case  8,  we  know  that  Γk+1  |= 
�∼ R ⊃ ∼ Q�. 
2.  So  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every  member 
of  Γk+1  is  true  and  �∼ R ⊃ ∼ Q�  is  false  (by  the  deﬁnition  of 
‘ |=’). 
3.  So  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every  member 
of  Γk+1  is  true  and  �∼  R�  is  true  and  �∼  Q�  is  false  (by  the 
deﬁnition  of  ‘⊃’). 
4.  So  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every  member 
of  Γk+1  is  true  and  R  is  false  and  Q  is  true  (by  the  deﬁnition 
of  ‘∼’). 
5.  So  there  is  no  truth-value  assignment  such  that  every  member 
of  Γk+1  is  true  and  Q  ⊃ R  is  false  (again  by  the  deﬁnition  of 
‘ ⊃’). 
6.  So Γk+1  |= Q ⊃ R. 
So Inductive  Step  is true  in the case when Pk+1  is  justiﬁed by Backwards 
Conditional  Introduction.  So, by  that and  the  stuﬀ  in  the proof of  the  soudness 
of  SD,  Inductive  Step  is  true.  So,  by  that  and  Base  Case,  SD�  is  sound.
