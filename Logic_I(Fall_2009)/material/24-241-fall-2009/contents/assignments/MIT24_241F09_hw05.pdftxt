Problem  Set  5 

In  class  I  talked  about  SL  being  truth-functionally  complete  (TF-complete).  For  the 
problems  below,  use  TLB’s  deﬁnition  of  TF-completeness,  according  to  which  it  is  sets  of 
connectives  that  are  (or  aren’t)  TF-complete: 

Deﬁnition:  A  set  of  connectives  is  TF-complete  iﬀ  a  language  with  only  connectives  in  that 
set  can  express  every  truth-function. 

1.  Assume  the  fact  in  6.1E  (1d).  Use  this  to  complete  problem  6.2E  (1). 
This  result  shows  that  the  algorithm  on  pages  252–255  generates,  for  any  truth-
function,  a  sentence  of  SL  that  expresses  that  truth-function.  So  it  completes  the 
proof  that  the  set  of  connectives  of  SL  is  TF-complete.  In  fact,  it  proves  that  the 
smaller  set  {‘
’,‘&’,‘∨’}  is  TF-complete,  because  those  are  the  only  connectives  in  SL 
¬ 
we  used  in  the  algorithm. 
2.  Use  the  fact  that  {‘
’,‘&’,‘∨’}  is  TF-complete  to  do  problem  6.2E  (5). 
¬ 
3.  Complete  problem  6.3E  (4b).  To  do  this,  explain  how  to  modify  the  proof  by  mathe­
matical  induction  on pages  260–264  of TLB,  and  explain why  your modiﬁcation  yields 
the  desired  proof.
