Problem  Set  8:  Answers 

Damien  Rochford 

All  the  interpretations  I  provide  are  relatively  informal.  It’s  ﬁne  if  you  did 
things  the  informal  way  I  did  them.  It’s  ﬁne  if  you  did  things  more  formally 
too.  Future  problem  sets  may  require  you  to  provide  formal  interpretations, 
however. 
I  have  explained  why  sentences  are  true  or  false  on  given  interpretations  in 
diﬀerent  ways  for  diﬀerent  answers,  in  the  hope  that  at  least  one  of  these  ways 
will make sense to you.  All the diﬀerent ways of explaining things are equivalent.

Question  2 

Part  (d) 

(∀x)((Ax & (∀y)(F y ⊃ E xy)) ⊃ Rx) 

Part  (k) 
(∃x)(F x & (∀y)(Ay ⊃ Dxy)) & (∃x)(Ax & (∀y)(F y ⊃ Dxy)) 

(∃x)((Ax & F x) & (∀y)((Ay & ∼ F y) ⊃ Dxy)) 

Part  (l)

Question  1 

Part  (d) 
‘C b  ≡  (∼ Ab  ≡  Ac)’  is  false  on  the  given  interpretation.  −4  is  not  a  positive 
number, so  ‘Ac’ is false on the given interpretation, and 39  is a positive number, 
so  ‘Ab  is  true,  and,  hence  ‘ ∼  Ab’  is  false  on  the  given  interpretation.  So  the 
sentence  on  the  right  of  the  main  ‘≡’  is  true  on  the  given  interpretation.  And, 
as  39  is  not  a  negative  number,  ‘C b’  is  false  on  the  given  interpretation.  So  the 
whole  biconditional  is  false  on  the  given  interpretation. 

Part  (f ) 
‘ ∼ (∼ Ab ∨ C b) ⊃ Baa’  is  true  on  the  given  interpretation.  A  quick  way  to  see 
this:  0  is  its  own  square  root,  so  ‘Baa’  is  true  on  the  given  interpretation.  So 
the  right-hand side of the conditional  is  true on the given  interpretation.  So  the 
whole  conditional  is  true  on  the  given  interpretation. 

Part  (h) 
∼ (Ab ∨ B cc) & (C c ⊃ ∼ Ac)  is  false  on  the  given  interpretation.  A  quick  way 
to  see  this:  39  is  a  positive  number,  so  ‘Ab’  is  true  on  the  given  interpretation. 
So  the  disjunction  inside  the  left  part  of  the  sentence  is  true.  So  the  negation 
of  that  disjunction —  i.e.,  the whole  of  the  left-hand  of  the  sentence —  is  false. 
So,  as  the  sentence  is  a  conjunction,  the  sentence  as  whole  is  false.

Question  2 
Part  (d) 
An  arbitrary  example: 
U D :  {Damien}
F x:  x  likes  peanut  butter. 
‘(∃x)((∃y)F y  ⊃ ∼ F x)’  is  true  on  this  interpretation.  Why?  Well,  I  don’t 
like  peanut  butter,  so  there’s  nothing  in  the  universe  of  discourse  that  likes 
peanut  butter,  so  the  antecedent  of  the  embedded  conditional  is  false,  on  this 
interpretation.  So  plugging  my  name  in  for  ‘x’  satisﬁes  the  embedded  condi­
tional.  So  the  sentence  is  true  on  this  interpretation. 

Question  3 
Part  (a) 
An  interpretation  on  which  ‘(∃x)(F x & Gx) ⊃ (∃x)∼ (F x ∨ Gx)’  is  true: 
UD:  {Damien}
F x:  x  likes  peanut  butter. 
Gx:  x  was  bitten  by  a  monkey. 

I  don’t  like  peanut  butter,  so  there  is  no  way  of  assigning  ob jects  in  the 
universe  of  discourse  to  variables  that  satisﬁes  ‘(F x & Gx)’,  so  the  antecedent 
of the conditional is false, so the whole conditional is true, on this interpretation. 
An  interpretation  on  which  ‘(∃x)(F x & Gx) ⊃ (∃x)∼ (F x ∨ Gx)’  is  false: 
UD:  {Damien}
F x:  x  likes  pancakes 
Gx  x  was  bitten  by  a  monkey. 

I both like pancakes and was bitten by a monkey, so there is something in the 
universe  of  discourse  that  both  likes  pancakes  and  was  bitten  by  a  monkey,  so 
the  antecedent  of  the  conditional  is  true.  And,  seeing  as  I  like  pancakes,  either 
I  like  pancakes  or  I was  bitten  by  a monkey,  so  I  am  not  such  that  it  is  not  case 
that  either  I  like  pancakes  or  I  was  bitten  by  a  monkey,  so  there  is  nothing  in 

2 

the universe of discourse such that  it  is not the case that either  it  likes pancakes 
or  it  was  bitten  by  a  monkey,  so  the  consequent  of  the  conditional  is  false.  So 
the  antecedent  of  the  conditional  is  true  and  the  consequent  is  false.  So  the 
conditional  is  false,  on  this  interpretation.

Question  1 

Part  (h) 
UD:  {Damien,  Ephraim}
M x:  x  is  a  TA. 
N y :  y  has  a  PhD. 

I  am  a  TA,  and  I  don’t  have  a  PhD.  Ephraim  has  a  PhD,  and  is  not  a  TA. 
So  nothing  in  the  universe  of  discourse  is  such  that  it  is  a  TA  iﬀ  it  has  a  PhD. 
So  the‘(∃y)(M y ≡ N y)’  is  false,  on  this  interpretation. 
But  there  is  something  that  is  a  TA  —  namely,  me.  And  there  is  some­
thing  that  has  a  PhD  —  namely,  Ephraim.  So  both  sides  of  the  biconditional 
‘(∃y)M y  ≡  (∃y)N y ’  are  true,  on  this  interpretation.  So  ‘(∃y)M y  ≡  (∃y)N y ’  is 
true,  on  this  interpretation. 

Question  4 

Part  (f ) 
UD:  {Damien,  Ephraim}
F x:  x  wears  glasses. 
Bxy :  x  is  shorter  than  y 

Ephraim  wears  glasses,  so  there  is  something  in  the  universe  of  discourse 
that  wears  glasses,  so  ‘(∃w)F w’  is  true,  on  this  interpretation. 
I don’t wear glasses, so the conditional embedded in  ‘(∀w)(F w ⊃ (∃x)Bxw)’ 
is  true  when  you  plug  in my  name  for  ‘w’  (as  the  antecedent  of  the  conditional 
is  false).  And  there  is  something  in  the  universe  of  discourse  shorter  than 
Ephraim —  namely,  me —  so  the  embedded  conditional  is  true  when  you  plug 
in  Ephraim’s  name  for  ‘w’  (as  the  consequent  of  the  conditional  is  true).  And 
we’re  the  only  things  in  the universe  of discourse.  So  ‘(∀w)(F w ⊃ (∃x)Bxw)’  is 
true,  on  this  interpretation. 
Neither Ephraim nor  I are  shorter  than ourselves,  and,  again, we’re  the only 
things  in  the  universe  of  discourse,  so  ‘(∀x) ∼ Bxx’  is  true,  on  this  interpreta­
tion.

Question  2 
Part  (f ) 
UD:  {Damien,  Ephraim}
M xy :  x  has  bigger  feet  than  y 
N xy :  x  is  taller  than  y . 
‘(∀x)(∀y)(M xy  ⊃  N xy)’  is  true  on  this  interpretation,  as  the  only  pair  of 
ob jects  in  the  UD  that  satisﬁes  the  antecedent  of  the  embedded  conditional  is 
�Ephraim, Damien� (i.e., Ephraim has bigger feet than I, but I don’t have bigger 
feet  than  he,  and  neither  of  us  have  bigger  feet  than  ourselves),  and  that  pair 
also  satisﬁes  that  consequent  (as  Ephraim  is  taller  than  I  am). 
‘(∀x)(∀y)(M xy  ⊃  (N xy  &  N yx))’  is  false  on  this  interpretation,  as  it  is 
not  the  case  that  for  every  pair  that  satisﬁes  the  antecedent  of  the  embedded 
conditional,  that  pair  satisﬁes  the  consequent.  The  only  pair  that  satisﬁes  the 
antecedent  is  �Ephraim,  Damien�,  as  I  said,  but  it  is  not  the  case  that  I  am 
taller  than  Ephraim,  so  it  is  not  the  case  that  Ephraim  is  taller  than  I  am  and 
I  am  taller  than  Ephraim  is,  so  the  consequent  is  not  satisﬁed  by  that  pair. 
So every member of the premise set is true on the this interpretation, and the 
conclusion  is  false  on  this  interpretation,  So  this  argument  is  quantiﬁcationally 
invalid. 

Part  (g) 
UD:  {Damien,  Ephraim}
Gx:  x  has  a  pet  mouse. 
Dxy :  x  has  the  same  birthday  as  y 
I  have  a  pet mouse,  so  ‘(∃x)Gx’  is  true,  on  this  interpretation. 
I  have  the  same  birthday  as  myself,  and  Ephraim  has  the  same  birthday  as 
himself,  so  ‘(∀x)(Gx ⊃ Dxx)’  is  true  on  this  interpretation. 
I  do  not  have  the  same  birthday  as Ephraim  and  he  does  not  have  the  same 
birthday  as  me,  so  neither  of  us  are  such  that  we  have  the  same  birthday  as 
everything  in  the  UD.  So  neither  of  us  are  such  that  we  have  a  pet  mouse  and 
we  have  the  same  birthday  as  everything  in  the  UD.  So  ‘(∃x)(∀y)(Gx & Dxy)’ 
is  false,  on  this  interpretation. 
So every member of the premise set is true on the this interpretation, and the 
conclusion  is  false  on  this  interpretation,  So  this  argument  is  quantiﬁcationally 
invalid.
