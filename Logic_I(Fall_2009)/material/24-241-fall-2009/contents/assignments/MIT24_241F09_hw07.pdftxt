Logic  I 
Fall  2009 
Problem  Set  7 

1.  Provide  your  own  examples  (not  the  ones  given  in  TLB)  of  each  of  the  following: 

(a)  A  sentence  of  PL  that  is  quantiﬁcationally  true 
(b)  A  sentence  of  PL  that  is  quantiﬁcationally  false 
(c)  A  pair  of  distinct  sentences  of  PL  that  are  quantiﬁcationally  equivalent 
(d)  A  pair  that  are  quantiﬁcationally  inconsistent 
(e)  A  set	 Γ  of  PL  sentences  and  a  PL  sentence  not  in  Γ  that  is  quantiﬁcationally 
entailed  byΓ 

2.  On  pg.  351  of  TLB,  the  authors  provide  a  list  of  quantiﬁcationally  equivalent  pairs  of 
sentences.  For  instance,  where  Ax  is  a  formula  containing  x,  (a)  is  equivalent  to  (b) 
on  the  condition  that  x  does  not  occur  in  P. 
(a)  (∃x)Ax ⊃ P 
(b)  (∀x)(Ax ⊃ P), 
(Note  that  the  main  logical  operator  of  (a)  is  the  horseshoe,  not  the  quantiﬁer.)  The 
italicized  restriction  is  essential.  To demonstrate  this, drop  the  restriction and provide 
a  sentence  of  the  form  in  (a)  or  the  form  in  (b)  such  that  there  is  not  an  equivalent 
sentence  of  the  other  form.  Explain  why  there  isn’t. 

3.  Complete  problems  7.8E  2c,  h,  i,  and  n.	 Indicate  the  main  logical  operator  of  each 
symbolization. 

4.  Complete  problems  7.8E  5h,  a,  n,  and  r.	 Make  the  translations  natural  in  English — 
no  ‘x’s  or  ‘y’s  allowed!
