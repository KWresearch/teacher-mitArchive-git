Question  1 
I  ﬁrst  prove  that  if  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ� ,  then P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ� .  I  do  this  by  proving 
the  contrapositive —  i.e.,  that  if  it  is  not  the  case  that P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ� ,  then 
it  is  not  the  case  that  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ� . 
1.  Suppose  it  is  not  the  case  that  P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ� . 
2.  Then  �∼ P� ∈ Γ�  and  �∼ Q� ∈ Γ�  (by  6.4.11(a)). 
3.  So  {�∼ P�, �∼ Q�} ⊂ Γ� . 
4.  Now,  {�∼ P�, �∼ Q�} � �∼ (P ∨ Q)�,  in  SD  (proof  below). 
5.  So  �∼ (P ∨ Q)� ∈ Γ�  (by  3,  4  and  6.4.9). 
6.  So  it  is  not  the  case  that  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ�  (again  by  6.4.11(a)). 
So,  if  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ� ,  then  P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ� .  Q.E.D. 
Here  is  a  proof  of  4  (I  think  we  did  something  very  like  this  in  class,  but  I 
do  a  derivation  here  anyway  for  completeness’  sake).

Now  to  prove  the  other  direction:  if P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ� ,  then  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ� . 
Again,  I  do  this  by  proving  the  contrapositive. 
1.  Suppose  it  is  not  the  case  that  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ� . 
2.  Then  �∼ (P ∨ Q)� ∈ Γ�  (by  6.4.11(a)). 
3.  So  {�∼ (P ∨ Q)�} ⊂ Γ� .

4.  Now,  {�∼ (P ∨ Q)�} � �∼ P�  in  SD,  and  {�∼ (P ∨ Q)�} � �∼ Q�  in  SD 
(proof  below). 
5.  So,  �∼ P� ∈ Γ�  and  �∼ Q� ∈ Γ�  (by  3,  4  and  6.4.9). 
6.  So  it  is  not  the  case  that  either  P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ�  (by  6.4.11(a)  again). 
So,  if  P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ� ,  then  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ� .  Q.E.D. 
Here  is  a  proof  of  the  ﬁrst  half  of  4 —  i.e.,  that  {�∼ (P ∨ Q)�} � �∼ P�.

The proof of  the other half of 4  is  the  same,  except you  replace  the  ‘P’s on  lines 
2  and  5  with  ‘Q’s. 
So, I’ve proven that if �P ∨Q� ∈ Γ� , then P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ� , and I’ve proven 
that  if  P ∈ Γ�  or  Q ∈ Γ� ,  then  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ� .  It  follows  that  �P ∨ Q� ∈ Γ�  if 
and  only  if  P ∈ Γ�  or Q ∈ Γ� .  And  that  concludes  the  proof. 

Question  2 

We’re trying to prove Inductive Step, on p.  273 of TLB, for the case in which P, 
a  sentence  containing  k + 1  occurrences  of  connectives,  has  the  form  �Q ∨ R�. 

1.  Suppose  that  every  sentence  of  SL with  k  or  fewer  occurrences  of  connec­
tives  is  such  that  it  is  true  on A�  if  and  only  if  it  is  a member  of  Γ�  (i.e., 
suppose  the  antecedent  of  Inductive  Step). 
2.  Now,  �Q ∨ R�  is  true  on A�  iﬀ  either Q  is  true  on A�  or R  is  true  on A� 
(by  deﬁnition  of  ‘∨’). 
3.  And Q is true on A�  iﬀ Q ∈ Γ� , and R is true on A�  iﬀ R ∈ Γ�  (by 1, and 
the  fact  that Q, R  both  contain  k  or  fewer  occurences  of  connectives). 
4.  So  �Q ∨ R�  is  true  on A�  iﬀ  either Q ∈ Γ�  or R ∈ Γ�  (from  2,  3). 
5.  So  �Q ∨ R�  is  true  on  A�  if  and  only  if  �Q ∨ R�  ∈  Γ�  (by  6.4.11(c)  — 
i.e.,  the  thing  we  just  proved  in  Question  1). 
So  Inductive  Step  is  true  for  the  case  in  which  P  has  the  form  �Q ∨ R�. 
Q.E.D.

Question  3 

The  completeness proof  for SD  will  fail,  as  a proof  for  the  completeness of SD � , 
at  the part where we  try  to prove 6.4.11(b) —  i.e.,  the proof  that �P&Q� ∈ Γ� 
if  and  only  if  both  P  ∈  Γ�  and  Q  ∈  Γ�  (where  Γ�  is  a  maximal  consistent-in-
SD  set  of  sentence  of  SL;  P,  Q  are  sentence  of  SL)  will  not  go  through.  In 
particular,  the  proof  that  if  �P&Q�  ∈  Γ�  then  both  P  ∈  Γ�  and  Q  ∈  Γ�  will 
not  go  through.  Note  that  the  proof  of  that  part  of  6.4.11(b),  on  p.  272  of 
TLB,  involves  appealing  to  the  Conjunction  Elimination  rule  explicitly. 
In  fact,  it will  not,  in  general,  be  the  case  that  a maximal  consistent-in-SD � 
set  is  such  that  if  �P&Q�  ∈  Γ�  then  both  P  ∈  Γ�  and  Q  ∈  Γ�  (though  this 
is  quite  hard  to  prove,  and  I  don’t  do  so  here).  There  will,  for  example,  be 
maximal  consistent-in-SD �  sets  that  are  supersets  of  { ‘A&B ’,  ‘∼ A’ }. 
Because  the  proof  of  6.4.11(b)  fails,  the  proof  of  what  the  book  calls  the 
‘Consistency  Lemma’  fails  too;  in  particular,  case  2  of  the  inductive  step  fails. 
Even  more  in  particular,  the  part  of  case  2  in  which  we  prove  that  if  �Q&R� 
is  false  on A�  than  it  is  not  in  Γ�  will  fail.  That  part  of  the  proof  relies  on  the 
part  of  6.4.11(b)  that  fails without Conjunction Elimination.  And  you  can  see 
why:  for  a  set  that  is  a  maximal  consistent-in-SD �  superset  of  { ‘A&B ’,  ∼ A’ }, 
‘A&B ’  will  be  false  on A� ,  but  it  is  in  there  anyway.
