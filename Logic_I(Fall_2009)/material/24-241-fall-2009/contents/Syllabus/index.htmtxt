***** Overview *****
In this course we will cover central aspects of modern formal logic, beginning
with an explanation of what constitutes good reasoning. Topics will include
validity and soundness of arguments, formal derivations, truth-functions,
translations to and from a formal language, and truth-tables. We will
thoroughly cover sentential calculus and predicate logic, including soundness
and completeness results.
***** Texts *****
The required text is: [Amazon_logo] Bergmann, Merrie, James Moor, and Jack
Nelson. The Logic Book. 5th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2008. ISBN:
9780073535630.
There are some errors in the text; a list of corrections is provided.

***** Assignments *****
In addition to regular reading assignments, there will be problem sets, short
quizzes, and a final exam. Problem sets will be assigned weekly on Tuesday, due
the following Tuesday. Quizzes will be closed-book, closed-notes, to be
completed in class. There will be 8-10 quizzes over the course of the semester,
and they will not be announced in advance. Make-up quizzes will not be allowed,
but your lowest two quiz scores (i.e. a zero if you miss one) will not be
factored into your final grade.
