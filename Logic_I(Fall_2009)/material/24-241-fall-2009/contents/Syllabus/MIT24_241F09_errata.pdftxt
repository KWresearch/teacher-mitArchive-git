(ii) Also, in the first and second sentences of the text that appears just below this
derivation, replace the occurrences of ‘L’ with ‘A’. 

(iii) In the second derivation that appears on the page, read 
D ≡ (~N ∨ A)

p. 205 
The derivation appearing on the top half of this page should appear as follows (and 
not as it appears in The Logic Book): 

p. 211 
(i) In the derivation at the top of the page, read 
1, 3 ≡E 
instead of 
1, 2 ≡E

(ii) On line 5 of the lower block of text, read 
We will take ‘B’ as our new goal. 
instead of 
We will take ‘B’ as our new goal ‘B’. 

p. 219

A / ~E 
instead of 
A / ~I 
on line 4 of the derivation. 

p. 220 
In the first derivation on this page, read 
A / ~E 
instead of 
A / ~I 
on line 4 of the derivation, and 
4-8 ~E 
instead of 
4-8 ~I 
on line 9 of the derivation. 

p. 223 
(i) Exercise 5.3E1(m) should read 
{(A ∨ B) ⊃ C, (D ∨ E) ⊃ [(F ∨ G) ⊃ A]} ⊦ D ⊃ (F ⊃ C) 
instead of 
{A ∨ B) ⊃ C, (D ∨ E) ⊃ [(F ∨ G) ⊃ A]} ⊦ D ⊃ (F ⊃ C).

(ii) Exercise 5.3E1(p) should read 
{(A & B) ≡ (A ∨ B), C & (C ≡ ~~A)} ⊦ B 
instead of 
{(A & B ≡ (A ∨ B), C & (C ≡ ~~A)} ⊦ B. 

p. 225 
(i) Exercise 5.3E6(c) should read 
{A ≡ (~B ∨ C), B ⊃ C } ⊦ A 
instead of 
{A ≡ ~(B ∨ C), B ⊃ C } ⊦ A. 

(ii) Exercise 5.3E6(g) should read 
{A ⊃ (D & B), (~D ≡ B) & (C ⊃ A)} ⊦ (A ⊃ B) ⊃ ~C

{(A ⊃ (D & B), (~D ≡ B) & (C ⊃ A)} ⊦ (A ⊃ B) ⊃ ~C. 

(iii) The first line of the argument in exercise 5.3E7(*d) should read: 
~(F ∨ G) ≡ ~(H ∨ I)

~(F ∨ G) ≡ (~(H ∨ I). 

p. 226 
In exercise 5.3E7(*j), the conclusion of the argument should be 
~(A ∨ ~B) 
instead of 
~(A ∨ B).

Page 180: 
4 lines from bottom: 
delete the two occurrences of '2' in the right column 
2 lines from bottom: 
replace 'Q' with 'P' in the right column 
Last line: 
replace 'P' with 'Q' in the right column 

That is, the incorrect rule 

Conditional Elimination 2 

| P ⊃ Q  

| Q

| P


should be replaced with the correct rule 

Conditional Elimination

Page 229: 
10 lines from bottom: 
replace '~Q' with '~P' 

Page 362: 
Lines 19-22: 
delete these lines (which begin "A shorter version is") 
Line 23: 
delete "very same pear as either x or y.”

Change: 

1.  A literal that is not an identity sentence 

2.	 A compound sentence that is not a universally quantified sentence and is 
decomposed 

3.	 A universally quantified sentence ("x)P such that P(a/x) also occurs on that branch 
for each constant a occurring on the branch and P(a/x) occurs on the branch for at 
least one constant a 

4.	 A sentence of the form a = t, where a is an individual constant and t is a closed term 
such that the branch also contains, for every literal P on the branch containing t, 
every sentence P(a//t) that can be obtained from P by Identity Decomposition. 

to: 

1.	 A literal that is not an identity sentence of the form a = t, where a is an individual 
constant and t is a closed term 

2.	 A sentence of the form a = t, where a is an individual constant and t is a closed term 
such that the branch also contains, for every literal P on the branch containing t, 
every sentence P(a//t) that can be obtained from P by Identity Decomposition 

3.	 A compound sentence that is not a universally quantified sentence and is 
decomposed 

4.	 A universally quantified sentence (∀x)P such that P(a/x) also occurs on that branch 
for each constant a occurring on the branch and P(a/x) occurs on the branch for at 
least one constant a. 

That is, amend clause 1 as shown, move clause 4 so that it is now clause 2, and renumber clauses 
2-3 so that they are now clauses 3-4.
