True  or  false: 

1.	 SD+  is  stronger  than  SD. 
2.	 If  {P } ! Q  in  SD,  then  ∅ ! P  ⊃ Q  in  SD. 
3.	 If  P  is  true  and  Q  is  true,  then  {P } ! Q  in  SD 
4.	 If  {P } ! Q  in  SD,  then  {P }!∼  Q  in  SD. 
5.	 If  P  is  true  and  Q  is  true,  then  {P  ! Q} 
6.	 If  P  is  true  and  Q  is  false,  then  {P  " Q} 
7.	 IfΓ  ∪ {P }  is  inconsistent,  then  for  some Q ∈ Γ,  {P, Q}  is  inconsistent. 

8.	 Use  appropriate  deﬁnitions  in  terms  of  TVAs  to  prove  the  following: 
IfΓ  1  ! P  andΓ  2  ! Q,  thenΓ  1  ∪ Γ2  ! P &Q.
