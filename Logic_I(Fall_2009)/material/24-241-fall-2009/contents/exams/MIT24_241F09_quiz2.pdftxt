•	 For  questions  2  and  3,  Let  Γ  be  a  set  of  SL  sentences  and P  an  SL  sentence. 
•	 If  you  cannot  complete  the  derivations  in  4  and  5,  you may  earn  partial  credit  if  your 
partial  proof  demonstrates  that  you  have  an  adequate  strategy. 

1.	

(a)  (5  pts.)  Is  the  argument  below  truth-functionally  valid? 
∼ (A ⊃ (B ∨ A))

∼ B

(b)  (20  pts.)	 Prove  your  answer  is  correct  with  a  truth-table.  Indicate  the  lines  of 
the  truth-table  that  prove  your  claim. 

2.	

(a)  (5  pts.)  If  Γ  is  truth-functionally  consistent  and  Γ  truth-functionally  entails  P, 
couldΓ  ∪ {P}  be  truth-functionally  inconsistent? 
(b)  (10  pts.)  Why? 

3.  (15  pts.)	 Prove  the  following:  IfΓ  ∪  P  is  truth-functionally  inconsistent,  then  the 
argument  whose  premises  are  the members  of  Γ  and  whose  conclusion  is ∼P  is  truth-
functionally  valid. 

4.  (20  pts.)  Prove  the  following  in  SD:  {(A&B ) ∨ (B&C )} % A ∨ (B&C )


5.  (a)  (5  pts.)  Is  the  argument  below  valid  in  SD? 
A 
∼ A

∼ (A& ∼ A)

(b)  (20  pts.)  Prove  your  answer  is  correct.
