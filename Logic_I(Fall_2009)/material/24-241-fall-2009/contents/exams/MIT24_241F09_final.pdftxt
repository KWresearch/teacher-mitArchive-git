Final  Exam 

You  may  not  use  any  notes,  handouts,  or  other  material  during  the  exam.  All  cell  phones 
must be turned oﬀ.  Please read all instructions carefully.  Good luck with the exam and with 
the  rest  of  your  time  at MIT! 

Part  One:  English  (1  pt.  each) 

1.	 Fill  in  the  blank:  An  argument  (in  English)  is  deductively  valid  iﬀ  . . . . 

2.	 Fill  in  the  blank:  English  sentences P  and Q  are  logically  equivalent  iﬀ  . . . . 

3.	 True  /  False:  For  any  argument  A  (in  English),  if  the  premises  and  conclusion  of  A 
are  all  true,  then  A  is  deductively  sound. 

4.	 True  /  False:  For  any  set  Γ  of  English  sentences,  if  no  member  of  Γ  is  logically  true, 
then  some  argument  whose  premises  and  conclusion  are  members  of  Γ  is  deductively 
invalid. 

5.	 True / False:  For any argument A  (in English),  if A’s conclusion  is  logically equivalent 
to  one  of  A’s  premises,  then  A  is  deductively  valid. 

Specify  whether  each  of  the  following  arguments  is  deductively  valid  or  invalid.

as  possible.  If  you  think  the  English  sentence  is  ambiguous  among  multiple  symbol­
izations, provide  them all.  In  the  space below,  you may provide a  single  symbolization 
key  to  cover  all  the  sentences.

26.	 Whenever  any  truth-functional  property  listed  in  question  (13)  holds  of  certain  sen­
tences  or  among  certain  sentences  and  sets  of  sentences  of  SL,  truth-tables  provide  a 
method  for  proving  that  that  property  holds.  When  we  turn  to  PL,  do  we  have  an 
equally  powerful  method?  Which  quantiﬁcational  properties,  when  they  obtain,  can 
(3  pts.) 
be  proved  in  PD  to  obtain? 

27.	 One  of  the  restrictions  on  the  use  of  ∃E  is  that  the  instantiating  constant  must  not 
occur  in  an  undischarged  assumption.  Explain,  using  an  example, why  this  restriction 
(3  pts.) 
is  necessary. 

28.	 Provide  derivations  to  prove  each  of  the  following  claims.  You  may  use  any  rules  of

(4  pts.) 

(e)  ∅ %∼ a = b ⊃∼ b = a 

(3  pts.) 

29.  Provide  a  sentence  of  PL  or  PLE  that  is  true  on  some  interpretation,  and  that  is  true 
(2  pts.) 
only  on  interpretations  whose  UD  contains  inﬁnitely many  things. 

30.	 Provide  a  sentence  of  PLE  that  is  true  on  some  interpretation,  and  is  not  true  on  any 
interpretation  whose  UD  contains  inﬁnitely many  things. 
(2  pts.) 

31.	 The  L¨owenheim-Skolem  Theorem  tells  us: 

If  a  set  Γ  of  sentences  of  PL  is  quantiﬁcationally  consistent,  then  there  is 
an  interpretation with  the  set  of  positive  integers  as  the UD  on which  every 
member  of  Γ  is  true. 

Prove  this  result.  You  may  appeal  to  any  of  our  meta-logical  results  from  class,  in­
(3  pts.) 
cluding  our  proofs  of  the  soundness  and  completeness  of  PD.
