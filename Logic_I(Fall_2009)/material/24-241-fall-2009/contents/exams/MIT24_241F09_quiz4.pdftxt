Quiz  4 

Complete  the  deﬁnitions  below. 

1.  P  is  derivable  from  Γ  (Γ ! P)  iﬀ. . . 

2.  P  is  truth-functionally  entailed  by  Γ  (Γ ! P)  iﬀ. . . 

3.  Γ  is  truth-functionally  consistent  iﬀ. . . 

4.  Γ  is maximally  consistent  in  SD  iﬀ. . . 

We  can  prove  by mathematical  induction  that  for  any  sentence P  of  SL,  on  any TVA P  has 
the  same  truth-value  as  P  preﬁxed  by  any  even  number  of  negations.  Complete  the  follow­
ing proof, letting S be the ordered sequence of all non-negative even integers (this includes 0). 

Basis  Clause:  . . . 

Inductive  Step:  If,  for  the  ith member of S, on any TVA P has  the  same  truth-value as P 
preﬁxed  by  n  negation  symbols,  where  n  is  the  ith member  of  S,  then  . . . 

Proof  of  inductive  step:  . . .
