Problem  1)  Peskin  &  Schroeder  20.1  (Spontaneous  Breaking  of  SU(5)) 

Problem  2)  Peskin  &  Schroeder  20.2(b)  (Z-Decays) 

Problem  3)  Peskin  &  Schroeder  20.5  (A  Model  with  Two  Higgs) 

Problem  4)  Peskin  &  Schroeder  pg.775,  (Final  Pro ject  on  Higgs  Decay) 

a)  Do  part  a)  on  pg.776. 

b)  Do  part  b)  on  pg.776,  but  only  do  the  decay  h0  W +W −  and  not  h0

→
c)  Do part c) on pg.776.  Note that you can leave the answer  in terms of Feynman parameters, 
but  that  you  should  verify  the  asymptotic  properties  that  Peskin  mentions.

Consider  the h0 
gg  decay rate through the dominant top-quark loop, dropping the other

terms.  What  is  the  decay  rate  in  the  limit  m2 
t  ≫ m2 
h?  Using  F (x)  and  your  answer  in  c), 
how  good  is  this  approximation  for  the  range  of  Higgs  masses  we  expect  to  probe  at  the 
LHC?  (You  should  look  up  what  this  range  is  if  you  do  not  know  it  and  cite  your  source.)
