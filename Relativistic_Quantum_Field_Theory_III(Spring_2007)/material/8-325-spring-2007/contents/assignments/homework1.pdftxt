Problem  1)  Practice  with  Local  and  Global  Symmetry 

Consider the theory 

L  =  L1  +  L2  =  ψ1  i /D1 ψ1  +  ψ2  i /D2 ψ2 

µ  =  i∂ µ  +  gAa

Let  Aµ  be  the  gauge-bosons  that  ensure  the  L1  part  of  the  Lagrangian  is  invariant  under 
a 
a  local  SU(2)  gauge  symmetry.  Show  that  L2  is  also  SU(2)  gauge  invariant.  L1  +  L2  also 
has  a  global  SU(2)  ﬂavor  symmetry.  Find  the  generators  of  this  global  symmetry. 
[This 
problem is from Georgi.] 

Problem  2)  Practice  with  Fadeev-Popov  in  QCD  and  QED 

In Peskin & Schroeder you will  ﬁnd the Fadeev-Popov procedure applied to QCD in gen­
eralized Lorentz gauge  ∂ µAa
µ  =  0  with  gauge-ﬁxing  parameter  ξ .  In  the  ﬁrst  part  of  this 
a  = 0  with  n2  < 0 
problem you  will  repeat the  steps but  use  a generalized  axial gauge,  nµAµ
and gauge-ﬁxing parameter  ξ . 

a)  Derive the generalized  axial-gauge QCD Lagrangian including gauge-ﬁxing  and ghost 
terms. 

b)  Usually  “axial-gauge”  is  reserved  for  the  case  n ·  A =  0  which  can  be  obtained  from 
the  ξ →  0 limit.  Derive the form  of  the gluon-propagator in this limit  and  show that 
the  ghost  ﬁelds  from  part  a)  decouple. 

Usually  one does  not  worry  about ghost interactions in QED. However,  this does depend 
on  the  gauge  choice. 
c)  Consider  the  gauge  choice  G(A) =  ∂µAµ  +  λAµAµ  in  QED.  Derive  the  Feynman 
rule for the ghost-photon interaction. 

Problem  3)  Positronium  Decay 

Positronium  is  a  non-relativistic  bound  state  of  an  e−  and  an  e+ .  The  S-wave  bound 
state  has  spin  S  = 0 (para-positronium)  or  S  = 1 (ortho-positronium). 
a) Use charge conjugation to show that para-positronium decays to either two or three 
photons,  and  that  ortho-positronium  does  the  opposite. 
b)  The probability  that the  e+  and  e−  are  at  the  same  spacetime  point  is  determined 
by  the  non-relativistic  wavefunction  for  the  bound  state,  ψ(~x).  Derive  a  formula  for  the 
decay  rate Γ for positronium to two-photons.  Your  result  should involve  ψ ,  and  M,  where 
M  is  the  appropriate  e+e−  →  γ γ  amplitude.  (The  discussion  in  Peskin  around  eq.(5.43) 
might  be  useful.) 
c)  Compute  |M|2  at  lowest  order  and  thus  determine  Γ  in  terms  of  me  and  the QED 
coupling  α.
