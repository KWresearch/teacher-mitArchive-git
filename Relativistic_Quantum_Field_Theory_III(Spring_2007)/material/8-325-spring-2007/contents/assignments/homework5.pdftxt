Problem  2)  The  CKM  matrix  for  n-families 

a)  Consider  the  CKM  matrix  V ,  but  with  n-families  instead  of  three.  By  repeating  the 
steps  carried  out  in  lecture,  determine  the  number  of  physical  parameters.  In  particular 
determine the  number  of  angles  and  the  number  of CP-violating phases  as a function  of  n. 

b)  It  would be nice to determine the  number  of physical parameters directly  from the original 
quark  Yukawa  couplings.  Consider  the  G  =  U (n) × U (n) × U (n)  symmetry  of  the  free 
quark  kinetic  terms.  This  symmetry  is  broken  by  the  Yukawa  matrices  down  to  U (1)baryon , 
so the number of physical parameters can be obtained by  taking  the number in the original 
n-family  Yukawa  coupling  matrices  and  subtracting  the  number  of  parameters  in  G/U (1). 
Verify  that  this  gives  the  same  number  of  real  parameters  and  phases  for  V  as  in  a). 

Problem  3)  CP  violation  in  B 

ππ →
a)  Explain  what  symmetry  forbids  B  decays  to  a  |ππiI=1  state,  where  I  is  isospin.  Deﬁne 
|π+π− iS  = (|π+π−i +  |π−π+ i)/√2  and  a  similar  equation  for  |π 0π− iS ,  then  work  out  the 
decomposition  of  these  states  and  |π 0π 0i in terms  of  two pion  states  with  I  = 0  and  I  = 2. 
b)  Integrating  out  the  top  and  W -boson gives the following  two  operators in the weak Hamil­
tonian  which  are  relevant  for  B 
ππ  decays, 
→
¯
( ¯uγµPLb)(dγ µPLu) , 
O1  = 
¯
( ¯qγ µPLq) , 
� 
O3  = (dγµPLb) 
q 
where  the  sum  is  over  q  =  u, d, s, c, b.  Here  O1  is  called  a  current-current  operator  and  is 
generated from  W -exchange  taken  at  low  energy.  O3  is  called  a  QCD  penguin  operator 
and  is  generated  by  the  penguin  diagram  mentioned  in  lecture,  but  with  a  top-quark  in 
the loop (draw it).  What CKM factors  come  along  with these two  operators? (There  are 
in  fact  twelve  four  quark  operators  Oi  relevant for  B 
ππ ,  but  we  will  only  study  two

of  them  in  this  problem.)  A  single  insertion  of  O1  or  O3  mediates the  B 
→
ππ  transition. 
Use  isospin  and  classify  O1  and  O3 .  Next  use  your  results  in  a)  and  determine  which 
operators contribute for decays to the diﬀerent  charged pion  ﬁnal  states.  How many  strong 
interaction  parameters  does  isospin  allow  for  these  decays? 

c)  Ignoring  the QCD penguin operator, determine which  weak phase of  the unitary  triangle is 
π+π−  decays.  The 
found  by  measuring  Im λ  from  the  time-dependent  asymmetry  in  B
→
parameter  λ  was  deﬁned  in  lecture  in  our  discussion  of  CP-violation  in  interference  with 
and  without  mixing. 

d)  Add  the  penguin  contribution  and  explain  what  this  does  to  your  result  in  part  c).  What 
non-CKM information do  we  now  need  to know to  extract information  about  weak phases 
from Im λ? 
[Aside:  In  fact,  if  we  had  precise  measurements  of  branching  ratios  and  CP-
asymmetries  for  the  diﬀerent  charge  channels  in  b)  then  it  can  be  shown  that  this  would 
allow  us to  simultaneously  determine the  strong  interaction parameters  and  the phase you 
found  in  c).]
