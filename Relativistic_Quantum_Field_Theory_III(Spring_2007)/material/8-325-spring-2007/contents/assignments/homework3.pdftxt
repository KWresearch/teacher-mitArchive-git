Problem  1)  Composite  Operator  Renormalization 

In  lecture  we  discussed  the  renormalization  of  parameters  in  a  Lagrangian.  Often  one  is  inter­
ested in studying  a local  current built from a product  of  ﬁelds at the same space-time point.  For 
example,  consider  Jµν  =  ψ¯(0)σµν ψ(0)  in  QED.  External  operators  like  J µν  may  require  renor­
malization  beyond  that  associated  with  the  ﬁeld  ψ(0) (you discussed an  example  of  this type in 
section).  In  this  problem  I  want  you  to  compute  the  anomalous  dimension  for  Jµν . To turn this 
into  a  problem  you  know  how  to  solve,  consider  adding  a  term 

µν  ψ0σµν ψ0

Lint  =  C0 
to the QED Lagrangian.  By  switching  from bare to renormalized  coeﬃcients and  ﬁelds as usual, 
compute  the  anomalous  dimension  for  C µν  in  MS  to  order  e2  .  [Hint:  Remember  you  only need 
the 1/ǫ  poles.  Compare  eqs.18.10  and  18.11  in  Peskin.  You  can  use  Zψ  from  Peskin  without 
computation.]  Now  write  Lint  =  C µν (µ)Jµν (µ) to  deﬁne  the  renormalized  current,  and  use  the 
anomalous dimension for  C µν (µ) to  ﬁnd  the  anomalous  dimension  of  Jµν (µ).

Comparing  with  data,  and  taking  Vud

normalization  conventions  for  fπ  in  the  literature.  The  one  in  this  problem  agrees  with  the 
convention  in  the  chiral  Lagrangian  in  problem  3  below,  fπ  =  f .  The  other  convention  is

In  lecture  we  derived  a  Feynman  rule  for  the  π−  to  W −  transition  by  starting  from  the  gauged 
SU(2)  chiral  Lagrangian,

where  DµΣ =  ∂ µΣ + iℓµΣ  and  ℓµ  =  −g2/√2 W µT +  + h.c.  [for  simplicity we’ll  assume  Vud  = 1 in

this problem]. 

a)  By  carrying  out  this  expansion  to  higher  order  in  the  pion  ﬁelds  derive  the  amplitude  for

this  amplitude (in the  charged Goldstone-boson basis).  Recall that  Lχ  has  a  four-boson 
interaction.  Feel  free  to  use  a  program  like  Mathematica  to  take  the  traces.  You  may  also 
use  results  given  in  lecture.
