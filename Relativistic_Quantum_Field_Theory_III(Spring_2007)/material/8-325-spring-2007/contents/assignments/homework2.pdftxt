Problem  1)  MS  beta-function  with  multiple  dimensionful  couplings 

Consider  a  ﬁeld  theory  with  a  set  of  couplings  g1 ,  g2 ,  . . .,  g� ,  . . .  which  we’ll  call  �g .  Your 
goal  is  to  derive  an  expression  for  the  beta-functions  in  the  MS-scheme  that  is  valid  at  any 
order  in  perturbation  theory.  (It  will  also  be  valid  for  both  renormalizable  theories  and  “non­
renormalizabile”  theories  with  irrelevant  operators.)  Let  Δ l (d) = Δ�  + � ρ�  be  the  dimension  of 
bare  in d = 4 − 2� dimensions.  We can deﬁne a dimensionless  running coupling 
the bare coupling g� 
in  the MS-scheme  by 

bare µ −Δ� (d)  = g� (µ, d)Zg� (�g), 
g� 
where  g� (µ, d)  is  analytic  in  d  and  Zg�  is  a  series  in  1/�.  Prove  that  the  beta-function  for 
g�  ≡ g� (µ, d)  is

this  notation  the  standard  beta-function  is  β (g�) = β (g� , 4).] 

Problem  2)  Scheme  and  gauge  dependence  of  beta-functions 

Consider  a  renormalizable  non-abelian  gauge  theory.  Let  g (µR )  and  β (g )  be  the  renormalized 
coupling  and  beta-function  in  a  mass-independent  renormalization  scheme.  This  could  be  the 
MS-scheme  or  an  oﬀshell momentum  subtraction  scheme,  etc. 

a)  Prove that in any scheme the ﬁrst term in the series expansion of β (g ) is gauge independent. 

b)  Prove  that  the  ﬁrst  two  terms  in  the  series  expansion  of  β (g )  are  scheme  independent. 

c)  Finally, prove that in the MS-scheme the renormalized coupling is gauge independent.  Thus 
in  this  scheme  all  terms  in  β (g )  are  gauge  independent.  Use  this  result  to  strengthen  the 
statement  in  a). 

Problem  3)  QCD  beta-function  in  background  ﬁeld  gauge 

Using background ﬁeld gauge derive the lowest order beta-function for QCD in a massless scheme 
by  carrying  out  the  computation  of  the  3  diagrams  discussed  in  lecture.  Express  your  result  in 
terms  of  the  quadratic  adjoint  Casmir  CA  and  the  number  of  quark  ﬂavors  nf .  What  is  the 
beta-function  for  an  SU(2)  gauge  theory  with  6  ﬂavors? 

Problem  4)  The  QCD  running  coupling  and  thresholds 

We  originally motivated  the  discussion  of mass-independent  renormalization  schemes  by  consid­
ering  µ � m.  However,  these  schemes  are  well  deﬁned  regardless  of  the  relation  between  µ  and 
m,  and  so  we  can  consider  using  them  for  µ  �  m  and  for  that  matter  µ  ≤ m.  In  this  problem 
we’ll  explore  how  this  works  in  QCD  at  one-loop  order. 
In  lecture you  saw  that  in a mass-dependent  scheme  for QED the  electron  “decouples”  from 
the  beta-function  as  we  go  below  its  mass  scale,  falling  oﬀ  quite  rapidly,  β (µ  �  m)  ∼  µ2/m2 .

However,  if you  consider  the mass-independent  QED beta-function with  an  e , µ− ,  and  τ
then 
−
apriori  you  have  the  same  beta-function  for  me  �  µ  �  mµ ,  µ  �  mτ ,  or  any  other  value  of 
µ.  The  issue  with  a  mass-independent  scheme  is  that  α(µ)  is  not  smart  enough  to  know  that 
heavy  particles  in  the  ﬁeld  theory  should  decouple.  This  is  an  important  piece  of  physics  that 
we’re  going  to  build  into  the  mass-independent  schemes  by  hand.  To  do  this  consider  evolving 
the  coupling  down  from  a  µ  �  mτ  with  the  beta-function  with  3-leptons,  n�  =  3.  When  we 
reach  µ = mτ  we’ll  decree  that  the  tau  is  removed  from  our  theory,  so  that  below  this  scale  we 
switch  to using  a beta  function  with  n�  = 2.  Lets  call  the  coupling  in  the  theory with  n�  leptons 
α(n� ) (µ).  To  ensure  that  this  process  does  not  disturb  our  ﬁeld  theory  too  much,  we’ll  demand 
that  scattering  amplitudes  computed  in  the  theory  with  n�  =  3  and  n�  =  2  are  the  same  at 
µ  =  mτ .  At  lowest  order  in  perturbation  theory  this  just  implies  continuity  of  the  coupling  at 
the  boundary,  α(3) (mτ ) = α(2) (mτ ).  At  each mass-threshold  we’ll  repeat  the  above  procedure  to 
build  in  the  decoupling  by  hand.1

a)  Let  αs

take  the  mass  of  the  bottom  and  charm  quarks  to  be  mb  =  5 GeV  and  mc  =  2 GeV 
(slightly heavier than in nature).  Using the decoupling procedure described above, compute 
(3) (µ = 1.5 GeV).  Compare  it  numerically  to  αs 
(5) (µ = 1.5 GeV).

b)  Consider  QCD  with  mu  =  md  =  ms  =  0  and  note  that  in  this  theory  the  proton-mass 
is  dominated  by  non-perturbative  dynamics  of  these  three  quarks.  Hence  we  expect  the

heavy-quark masses.  Now  imagine that the strong coupling  is ﬁxed at some very high scale 
(eg.  at  a  uniﬁcation  scale  ∼ 1016 GeV),  and  predict  how  much  the  proton-mass  changes  if 
you  double  the  b-quark  mass. 

1 In  the  context  of  eﬀective  ﬁeld  theory  this  procedure  of  removing  particles  is  known  as  “integrating  out”  a 
massive  degree  of  freedom,  and  ensuring  the  continuity  of  the  S-matrix  elements  is  known  as  “matching”.
