Problem  1)  Peskin  &  Schroeder,  Problem  19.1,  page  686-687 

Problem  2)  Axial-Anomaly  in  Dimensional  Regularization 

Compute the  axial  anomaly for QED in four-dimensions from the triangle diagram using  dimen­
sional  regularization (show all your steps ie.  not just those displayed in Peskin).  Demonstrate 
that  your  result  is  equivalent  to  a  matrix  element  of  the  operator  equation 

∂µJ µ5  =  −

which  we  discussed  in  two  diﬀerent  ways  in  lecture. 

Problem  3)  Baryon  and  Lepton  Number 
Let  B µ  be  the  current  for  baryon  number,  and  Lµ  be  the  current  for  lepton  number.  Show  that 
B µ  has  an  anomaly,  but  that  B µ  −  Lµ  does  not. 

Problem  4)  The  decays  π 0  →  γ γ  and  η  →  γ γ 

a)  Compute  the  matrix  element  and  the  decay  rate  Γπ0  for  π 0  →  γ γ  through  the  anomaly. 
(You  may use  results  from  lecture.)  Using  the  experimental  values  for  mπ  and  fπ  compare 
your result with the experimental  value for the decay  rate in the PDG (http://pdg.lbl.gov/). 

b)  Consider  η 0 ,  the  8’th  Goldstone  boson  of  the  spontaneous  symmetry  breaking  SU (3)L  × 
in QCD. Assume  that the decay  η 0  →  γ γ  also  preceedes  through  the 
SU (3)R  →  SU (3)V 
axial  anomaly  and  compute  Γη0 /Γπ0 .
