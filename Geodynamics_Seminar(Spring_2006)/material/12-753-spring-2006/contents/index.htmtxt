***** Course Description *****
In this year's Geodynamics Seminar, we will explore the depth and breadth of
scientific research related to Earth's present and past ice-sheets, glaciers
and sea-ice, as well as extraterrestrial planetary ice.
Invited speakers have been chosen from experts in the current frontiers in ice-
related research, including planetary ice, climate records from polar and
tropical ice cores, the Snowball Earth, subglacial volcanoes, ice rheology, ice
sheet modeling, ice microkinetics, glacial erosion and tectonics, subglacial
life and polar remote sensing.
A field trip to Iceland in Summer 2006 will allow us to view some of the
island's ice caps and glacial geology, the exposed mid Atlantic Ridge and
evidence of ice-volcano interactions.
