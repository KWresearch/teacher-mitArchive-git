Arrival in Keflavik 

If visibility is good, we will be able to see Snæfellsjökull, the composite cone on 
Snæfellsnes, northwest of Keflavík. The ride from the airport to Reykjavik center takes 
about 1 hour. We will pass lava fields on the way. A number of volcanoes and 
hyaloclastite ridges (formed by subglacial volcanism) form the mountain chain near the 
horizon south and east of the road.  Off the road to our right, we should see steam rising 
from the Svartsengi district heating building and from blá lónið (The Blue Lagoon).  Also 
on the right is a sharp-peaked mountain, Keilir, a subglacial cone.  It is the subglacial 
equivalent of Surtsey, the submarine cone/subaerial lava shield at the southwestern end of 
the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago off the south coast of Iceland. 

Reykjavik 

Reykjavik is the capital of Iceland with more than 113,000 inhabitants (2005), or nearly 
40% of the country’s total population. It is the seat of government, and most of the 
government agencies. The Parliament "Althing," which is considered to be the oldest in 
the world, assembles in Reykjavik. Even though the city is spread over a vast area (242 
km²) the distances to reach natural surroundings are short. "Ellidaar," one of the country’s 
best salmon rivers, runs right through town and anglers enjoy landing salmon from this 
clear and unpolluted river under the bridge of a busy motorway.  Iceland’s first settler, 
Ingolfur Arnarson, made his permanent residence in Reykjavik in the year 874 and the 
area has been inhabited ever since.  Upon arrival, Ingolfur saw steam rising from hot 
springs near a cove and consequently named the bay "Reykjavik" - The Steamy Cove. 

Reykjavik gets hot water from five geothermal fields: Laugardalur, Elliðaárdalur, 
Seltjarnarnes, Reykir in Mosfellssveit and from Nesjavellir.  The Laugardalur valley 
(“Hot-spring-valley”), where we will be staying, is the site for the main Reykjavik 
geothermal area. Numerous wells have been sunk and the hot water is pumped directly 
from the ground into all houses in the greater capital area, providing inexpensive central 
heating and resulting in a smoke-free city. A short distance from the campground is the 
drill site and a botanical garden. The campground is near the harbor. To the west of the 
campground is a top-rated sports facility, spa, and swimming complex. 

The city has numerous art galleries, museums, libraries, and theaters. There are also 
many excellent hotels, restaurants, and clubs. The University of Iceland is located in 
Reykjavík and is home to about 5000 students. The trip from Laugardalur by public bus 
to the city centre or the Bus Central Station (BSI), takes 10 minutes or approx. 30 min. 
walking. 

<Reykjavik> Borgarnes 74 km, Thingvellir 49 km, Grindavik 52 km, Keflavik 54 km. 

Blue Lagoon, blá lónið 

The Blue Lagoon was created accidentally by the condense discharge water from the 
geothermal power plant in Svartsengi. The water was expected to disappear into the 
permeable lava field, but sedimentation gradually made the coarse lava field watertight, 
and the lagoon continued expanding.  It has become the most frequented tourist attraction 
of the country. Soon after people started bathing in the lagoon, the healing qualities of the 
brine were discovered by those who suffer from skin diseases such as psoriasis.  Since 
then, an increasing number of patients from all over the world has enjoyed the relief of 
the Blue Lagoon waters. 

-------------------------------- DAY 2 --------------------------------

Thingvellir 

We will head east from Reykjavík, towards Nesjavellir geothermal area. (“start drive 
towards Selfoss, appr. 5 km after leaving the city– turn left across Mosfellsheidi along the 
thermal pipeline, pass Nesjavellir Power Plant, stop at the plant and visit the visitor centre 
and 2000 yr old crater row. Eventually walk to the hot springs.”) The Nesjavellir 
geothermal area is located at the southern shore of Lake Thingvallavatn, close to the 
major central volcano Hengill. This is an active volcano complex, with at least one 
historical eruption. On the way, watch for products of subglacial volcanism and 
postglacial lavas. 

Leaving Nesjavellir, the route goes north along the shore of Lake Thingvallavatn, across 
a faulted part of the volcanic zone and across 2000-yr old Nesjavellir lava, to Thingvellir 
proper. 

Lake Thingvallavatn is the largest natural lake of the country with an area of 83.7 km². Its 
greatest depth is 114 m, and this lowest point lies 13 m below sea level. Very little water 
enters the lake on the surface, which means that it is mainly spring fed. The lake 
discharges to the River Sog, the longest spring fed river of the country with a nearly 
constant volume of 112 m³/sec. Three hydro electric power stations are situated on the 
river. The large and deep lake is partly filled in by postglacial volcanism. The lake 
contains an abundance of at least four species of char and brown trout and angling is a 
popular pastime. The farmers of the area net the lake and process the fish for the 
domestic and foreign markets. To the east of the lake is a major shield volcano, 
Lyngdalsheiði. The present landscape has been developing for about 9000 years and is 
still being shaped by plate tectonics. 

The name “Thingvellir” means "Parliament Plains," the site of the old Icelandic 
legislative assembly, the Althing, the oldest parliament in the world (930 AD). The 
Parliamentary Plains are the most important historic site of the country. 

Thingvellir is a major rift valley with extraordinarily well developed rift-fissure systems 
that illustrate plate tectonics better than any textbook can. This is where the North 

American and Eurasian plates part. To the north, we may have a view of some 
spectacular glaciers and volcanoes, including Skjaldbreiður, a classic lava shield volcano. 
The park has a small Natural History exhibition, located at an overview site at the rim of 
the Thingvellir rift valley. Visitors can will walk down Almannagjá, one of the large 
faults, and visit the Öxarárfoss waterfall. On the east side of the graben at Þingvellir is 
Þjófahraun, a lava shield row. 

Thingvellir was officially added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in August 2004. 

From Thingvellir, we will head west toward the coast, turning north onto Rte 48 to 
Hvalfjordur. 

The focus in the area of Hvalfjordur is Plio-Pleistocene volcanism and glaciations, the 
last deglaciation and sea level changes. The route will pass below the eastern slopes of 
Mt Esja (914 m), which dominates the horizon north of Reykjavik. Mt Esja is the result 
of Plio-Pleistocene volcanism, and contains basaltic lavas as well as gabbroic intrusions 
and rhyolite, numerous basaltic dykes and clastics (volcanic and glacial sediments). The 
Esja succession covers about 1.3 million years, between 3.1-1.8 million years ago. We 
may visit a section at the base of Mt Esja, where clastic sediments of glacial or rockfall 
nature outcrop. We will then drive along the Hvalfjörður shore. This is a major ice-carved 
valley system, occupied by a large outlet glacier or ice stream during repeated 
glaciations. The name Hvalfjörður means “Whale Fjord,” because whales were often seen 
in this area.  (The local whaling station was closed in 1992.) The fjord is about 30 km 
long and up to 84 km deep. 

Along the way are outcrops of Late Pliocene clastic rocks and the eroded remnants of a 
Late Tertiary major volcanic system, the Hvalfjörður Volcanic Complex. These include 
dyke swarms, intrusion rocks and thick lava flows filling up an ancient caldera. Raised 
beaches formed by the end of the last glaciation can also be seen, as well as impressive 
signs of fairly young subglacial volcanism. After Hvalfjörður, Rte 50 goes along lakes 
Þórsstaðavatn and Draghálsvatn, to Skorradalur. Skorradalur is a glacially sculptured 
valley, occupied by a large and deep lake. Its surface is at 52 m a.s.l. 

Skorradalur was a fjord by the end of the last glaciation, and some of the highest Late 
Glacial raised beaches in Iceland occur where the valley opens into the larger 
Borgarfjörður valley. These beaches are from Bølling times, ca. 12.6 ka BP. The best 
exposure is at Stóri Sandhóll, which is a marine terrace reaching 150 m a.s.l. It is a key 
location for understanding the dynamics of the last deglaciation of Iceland, illustrating 
very rapid ice retreat and isostatic rebound. 

Some or all of the following sites to the north may be visited before turning west to join 
Rte 1 north to Hrútafjörður: 

Deildartunguhver 

•	 Most powerful hot spring  in  the wor ld, emits 200 liters of boiling water per second. Nearby 
greenhouses sell “delicious Icelandic tomatoes .” 

Hraunfossar 

•	 Waterfalls emerg ing from the junction of porous rock and basalt, falling in to a 1 km long gorge 
created by the glacial r iver Hvítá. Hraunfossar means “Lava falls.” 
•	 Quite picturesque, in  the middle of a huge lava f ield (Hallmundarhraun). 
There are walking paths on the lava field, notice especially  the traditional cairns (vörður) on the 
•	
walk ing paths. 

Barnafoss 

•	 Waterfall just upstream from Hraunfossar, fo llow  the walking path. 
Legend has it that two ch ildren drowned here when  they  tr ied to cross the r iver, walking on a 
•	
natural rock arch . The children’s mother had  the arch broken down to protect o ther families from 
meeting the same fate. You can see the remains of that arch at the waterfall. 
The name means “Children’s waterfall”. 
Take road no. 518 back  to Reykholt.

•	 One of Iceland’s most impor tant historical sites . Dur ing the Middle Ages , this was a large, rich 
farm, a cen ter of relig ion, culture and politics . 
The famous wr iter and statesman Snorri S turluson (1179-1261) lived here. Today you can see a 
well preserved  thermal pool from the Middle Ages, where Snorri used  to bathe. Snorri S turluson 
was assassinated  in a tunnel that led from here to his house. You can see the entrance to  th is 
tunnel, too. 
The town has a modern church w ith a cultural cen ter and a library for Medieval studies, and 
changing exhibitions on Med ieval Iceland ic literature and cu lture. 
Statue of Snorri S turluson by  the Norweg ian sculp tor Gustav Vigeland , a gif t from Norway,

Rte 1 North from Varmaland (Rte 50) to Hrútafjörður passes through the following areas: 

Bifrost (on Rte 1 north of Varmaland) 

Bifrost is located in the Borgarfjörður area of faulted Tertiary lava. The craters, lava 
field, and mountainous surroundings are unique. The 3600-year old lava field is vegetated 
with mosses, lichens, berries, willow and birch. A rhyolite intrusion, the cone-shaped Mt. 
Baula, is conspicuous in the background.

Bifrost 58 km <Stadarskali> Laugarbakki 27 km 

-------------------------------- DAY 3 --------------------------------

Our original plan for this day was to drive all the way to Asbyrgi and camp 2 nights in 
the Jokulsargljufur N.P. campground at Asbyrgi. Because of weather, road closures and 
estimated driving times (below), we chose instead to spend those two days in the Lake 
Myvatn area. It was a good choice. 

Distances from Saeberg Hostel to Asbyrgi: 
most direct (via Husavik) - 385 km 
via Lake Myvatn and Rte 864 - 425 km 
via Lake Myvatn, Rte 87 and Husavik - 450 km 

Laugarbakki 

Laugarbakki is a hamlet situated in a geothermal area on the eastern banks of the 
renowned salmon river Midfjardara. According to the Grettis-Saga (see the Appendix for 
more about the Icelandic sagas), this area was called "Langafit" in the past and a fateful 
horse fight was held here. The first houses of the hamlet were built in 1933 and the 
construction of the boarding school was begun in 1970. 

Hvammstangi 7 km <Laugarbakki> Blonduos 56 km 

Borgarv irk i

Looks like an ancient fortification or citadel, situated between two d istr icts of Iceland, possibly 
•	
built as a defense against attacks. 
•	 Mentioned in  two Icelandic sagas: Heiðarv íga Saga and Finnboga Saga. 
Take road no. 717 and 716  to get back onto road no. 1. continue on road no. 1 to reach Blönduós. 
•	

Blonduos 

Blonduos lies on the banks of River Blanda, and Road #1 runs through town across the 
river. Shops, light industry, meat processing, an abattoir, and a dairy are the main sources 
of employment in Blonduos, as well as a growing tourist sector.  Fishing and fish 
processing are also increasing in spite of the poor harbour conditions and limited 
facilities. River Blanda is one of the country's popular salmon rivers. 

Laugarbakki 56 km <Blonduos> Varmahlid 51 km. 

•	 Take road no. 1 and drive through the 25 km long valley Langidalur and over the 
mountain pass Vatnsskarð (440 m high). 

Arnarstapi 

•	

•	

•	

coming down from the mountain pass Vatnsskarð you have a great view, you 
should stop at Arnarstapi viewpoint. 
there is also a memorial for Stephan G. Stephansson (1853-1927), an Icelandic 
farmer and poet who lived in this area before leaving the country to settle in 
Canada. 
•	 many farmers and poor people from the Skagafjörður area emigrated to Canada 
and the USA in the late 19th and early 20th century, forming the community of 
the West-Icelanders in Canada (especially in Manitoba). 
before reaching Varmahlíð you can find the church of Víðimýri not too far from 
road no. 1. 

Víðimýrikirkja 

•	
•	

one of the most beautiful turf churches still existing in Iceland, built in 1834. 
very good example of traditional Icelandic architecture. 

Varmahlíð 

•	
•	

Small village, 130 inhabitants. 
Services. 

Varmahlid 

Varmahlid is a hamlet on road #1 by the crossroads to Saudarkrokur and Akureyri. The 
village developed around services for travellers and its oldest hotel and restaurant date 
from 1931. Now Varmahlid offers more hotels and guesthouse accommodations, a 
supermarket, petrol station, bank, post office, tourist information centre and other 
facilities. An abundance of geothermal hot water is under the area.  Hence a number of 
greenhouses in the hamlet cultivate tropical and sub-tropical fruits and vegetables. 
Reforestation is in its early stages here where woods are being grown for future 
exploitation. Varmahlid is a school centre for the region. Salmon and trout are caught in 
nearby rivers and lakes. North of Varmahlid is the folk museum "Glaumbaer," which 
attracts thousands of visitors annually. 

Rte 1 from Varmahlid to Akureyripasses crosses the moorland Öxnadalsheiði (check 
weather and road conditions before traveling). The west side of the route follows 
Öxnadalur, a very deep and narrow valley, 35 km long. The adjacent rocky mountain 
ridge Hraundrangi is more than 1000 m, and many folk tales are connected to it.  Two of 
the most famous Icelandic poets lived in this valley: Jónas Hallgrímsson (1807-1845), 
scientist and poet, was born at the farm Hraun and Jón Þórláksson (1744-1819), poet and 
translator, lived at the farm and parsonage Ytri-Bægisá. 

Blonduos 51 km <Varmahlid> Akureyri 94 km. 

Akureyri 

The fourth largest town of the country is often called "The Capital of the North". Its 
oldest parts are situated on a narrow strip of land and a spit at the end of the long bay 
Eyjafiordur. The younger parts of the town have developed on the slopes above. Akureyri 
boasts of a thriving cultural life, museums, a college, a university and other schools. Its 
older church is among the most beautiful of the country and well worth a visit.  The 
skiing resort on Mt Hlidarfjall, just north of town, is among the best in the country and 
skiing is a very popular sport in the area. The Botanical Garden and the recreational area 
Kjarnaskogur attract many visitors. The town offers all necessary services to travellers, 
sightseeing tours, angling in lakes, rivers and the sea, a colourful nightlife. 

Varmahlid (via Rte #1) 94 km <Akureyri> Myvatn 99 km, Husavik 91 km 

From Akureyri take road no. 1, drive through the village Svalbarðseyri, up to the 
mountain plateau Vaðlaheiði and over the pass Ljósavatnsskarð. 

If time permits, we can make a short detour south on Rte 842 to reach Goðafoss waterfall 
and/or visit the Lake Myvatn area (list of sights below). Otherwise, we will turn north on 
Rte 85 and drive to Husavik and the Jokulsargljufur N.P. campground at Asbyrgi.

Husavik – HAS HOSPITAL 

Husavik is a town on the eastern shores of The Skjalfandi Bay.  It is a commercial centre 
for a large agricultural area and processing of farm produce plays a considerable role in 
the town’s economy.  Many dairy and meat products processed here are shipped all over 
the country.  Fishing and fish processing are also important bases of livelihood.  The 
fastest growing trade, however, is tourism.  Accommodations, cuisine, and services to 
travelers are at their very best. Husavik was the first place in Iceland to offer whale 
watching cruises and many tourists’ sole purpose for visiting the town is to participate. 
Husavik is therefore called “The Whale Spotting Capital of The World”.  The Whale 
Centre is ideal for getting better acquainted with the giants of the oceans. The Folks 
Museum is among the most attractive in the country. 

Akureyri 91 km, Myvatn 54 km via Kisilvegur, 76 km via Reykjadalur  <Husavik> 
Kopasker 100 km, Asbyrgi 67 km. 

-------------------------------- DAY 4 --------------------------------

Our original plan was to stay 2 nights in the Jökulsárgljúfur National Park campground at 
Asbrygi, which would have served as our base for a volcanically active day led by Roger 
Buck. Instead, DAY 4 wa spent in the Myvatn/Krafla area, which was an excellent 
alternative. 

-------------------------------- DAY 5 --------------------------------


Drive (a long one!) from Myvatn to Egilsstadir, to Reydarfjordur, then to Hofn along the 
fiords.  The route to Egilsstadir takes us across the eastern volcanic zone, across 
hyaloclastite ridges (móberg), which are brownish breccias formed in subglacial 
eruptions. 

Hrossaborg 

"The Horse Castle" is one of two "tuff rings" situated in the northeastern part of the 
country. This one is about 10,000 years old and the other one, Hverfjall, on lake Myvatn 
is much younger, 2500 years old.  The farmers on Lake Myvatn used to graze their horses 
in this area and used the crater as a pen when they were rounding them up in autumn 
before driving them back home. There is a track into the concave of the crater, where it 
looks almost like an amphitheatre. The road to Askja is just east of the tuff ring and the 
crossing on road #1 is very close.

Egilsstadir 

Egilsstadir is the capital of the East and Fellabaer is a village on the opposite bank of the 
glacial lake/river Logurinn. Both communities are situated inland, in the largest lowland 
area of the East. Egilsstadir received its municipal rights in 1987 and the inhabitants of 
both communities base their livelihood on services rendered to the surrounding 
agricultural areas, tourism and commerce. Egilsstadir is the centre of communications for 
the East with a domestic and an alternate international airport.  The 27 km. long mountain 
road  Fjardarheidi connects Egilsstadir with the ferry town (Norrona) Seydisfiord. If you 
are traveling to the south towards town Reydarfiord, you should check road and weather 
conditions.

Valley Breiddalur is the largest lowland area of the Eastfjords and the mountains framing 
the valley are the highest in the region (1100-1200 meters above sea level). The salmon 
river Breiddalsa is the most renowned and prolific of the area.  Ever since the adoption of 
Christianity, the parsonage Heydalir has been in existence. The small Jorvik forest is one 
of the centres of the Forestry Service. One of the rarest endemic tree species, European 
Aspen (poplars; Populous tremula), thrives quite well there. The village Breiddalsvik 
bases its existence on fishing and fish processing. Tourism plays an increasing role for 
the inhabitants.

Djupivogur 

This village at the head of the bay Berufiord developed around an important trading post 
in the past. In 1589, the German Hansa merchants were granted a trading license there by 
the Danish king. Later, the Danish introduced the trade monopoly and took over 
themselves. The oldest houses (1788-1818) date to the Danish period. One of them, 
Langabud (1790), has been renovated and transformed into a restaurant and museums. 
Fishing, fish processing and commerce are the main trades. The scenic beauty of the 
surroundings is renowned and visitors are treated well in every respect. The hotel Framtid 
(Hotel Future) has a good restaurant and a sauna. A Youth Hostel is at the nearby farm, 
Berunes. Boat trips to the island Papey, deep sea angling and a bike rental are among the 
recreational opportunities. The monument in the middle of the small town was sculpted 
by Johanna Thordardottir and was unveiled on June 20th, 1999 in memory of drowned 
seamen and fishermen.

This community is also called Hornafjardarbaer. It is situated on a spit of land in the only 
navigable estuary of the country. The main trades are fishing, fish processing, tourism 
and commerce. People started settling here around an important trading post more than a 
century ago, and the town received its municipal rights in 1988. Visitors are offered 
varied recreational opportunities: tours, golf, whale watching, fishing, cultural events, 
museums etc. During summer the Glacier Exhibition in the old supermarket building is 
worth a visit. A part of the municipal landscape has been declared a nature reserve. 

The Hornafjörður central volcanoes 

The Hornafjörður central volcanoes (which we have been driving in since Egilsstadir) 
formed within a Tertiary volcanic zone that currently stretches along the southeastern 
margin of Vatnajökull and northwards, across the eastern fjords. A 250 km long flexure 
zone is associated with the western margin of this feature. A total of 17 severely eroded 
late Tertiary central volcanoes have been identified within the eroded volcanic zone but 
less than half of them have been studied in any detail. These volcanoes range in age from 
3-11 Ma. Many have been severely eroded by Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciers and some 
are still partly covered by outlet glaciers from Vatnajökull, the largest icecap in Iceland. 

Several magnificent outlet glaciers from Vatnajökull frame the Hornafjörður region. 
These glaciers reached their maximum postglacial extent during the 19th century and 
have on the whole been retreating since the middle 1890s. Glacier moraines along our 
route mark the maximum glacial extent during this time. 

Sydrifjodur, the 888 m high hill to the east of Hofn, is made up of the net-veined complex 
of the Austurhorn intrusion. Abundant occurrences of acid and gabbroic intrusions are 
related to the central volcanoes in SE-Iceland. The Austurhorn intrusion is one of a 
number of larger gabbro and granophyre intrusions in SE-Iceland. The eastern part of this 
intrusion consists of a net-veined complex, in which acid, basic and hybrid intermediate 
rocks are entwined. The basic and hybrid rocks occur as rounded to angular masses 
enclosed in and veined by granophyre. The complex is considered to have been formed at 
a maximum of 1700 m depth, shortly after the emplacement of, first, the granophyre 
magma, which displaced the country rocks by stoping, and second, the gabbro magma, 

which was intruded into the granophyre magma before the latter had completely 
solidified [Blake, 1966]. Rb-Sr isochron age of 4 granophyre samples is 12.8+/-5.3 Ma, 
whereas K-Ar ages range from 10.3+/-1.4 Ma to 13.6+/-2.4 Ma [Åberg et al., 1987].

Kálfafellsdalur 

“Numerous sheeted dikes make up the strata in the eastern slopes of the Kálfafellsdalur 
valley. Green breccias in this region are believed to have been emplaced at 1-1.5 km 
depth under subaqueous conditions. However, they are not related to any specific central 
volcano.” 

Jökulsárlón 

“Jökulsárlón is the proglacial lake at its terminus, and a short river, Jökulsá, spanned by a 
suspension bridge, discharges the lake directly into the North Atlantic.  The lake will be 
filled with icebergs and was the backdrop for two James Bond films.” 

Prior to 1950 the 1½ km long course of the glacial river Jökulsá was uninterrupted by any 
lagoon. Since then the glacier tongue has retreated and a lagoon, gradually increasing in 
area, was created. The average flow of the river is 250-300 m³/sec. and the edge of the 
glacier snout floats on the water. It calves into the lagoon and icebergs of different sizes 
can be seen aground and melting rather quickly. The lagoon is very deep, at least 190 
metres. The river gets shorter and shorter, mainly because of the constant sea erosion, 
which eventually is going to destroy the bridge (built in 1967). The result will be a deep 
bay, which is going to grow longer the farther the glacier snout retreats. The lagoon's 
surface has been lowered almost to sea level and sea water enters with the tides, 
increasing the water temperature.  Salmon, capelin and herring enter the lagoon and the 
harbour seals follow the food. Eider ducks are very common on the lagoon. It is an 
unforgettable adventure to take a boat trip between the icebergs to admire the natural ice 
sculptures and the blue green colour of the ice. 

“Breiðamerkursandur is a collective name of the proglacial area of Hrútárjökull and 
Fjallsárjökull, outlet glaciers from Öræfajökull and Breiðamerkurjökull respectively. 
Breiðamerkurjökull is the broadest, south-eastern outlet glacier of Vatnajökull proper and 
made up of 3 main icestreams. The glacier engulfs a 20 km long glacially eroded fjord 
that reaches down to 300 m b.s.l. At Iceland's settlement (A.D. 874) Vatnajökull is 
considered to have been divided into 2-3 main shields with much smaller outlet glaciers 
than today. At that time the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier snout lay at least 15 km behind 
the 1894 moraine. Two settlement farms are known to have existed on 
Breiðamerkursandur until around 1700. Their ruins were engulfed by the advancing 
glacier before 1720. In 1732 the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier snout lay about 9 km from 
the shore whereas in 1869 only 200 m separated the snout from the shore. Since 1894 the 
glacier has retreated 4 km and decreased in volume by 50-60 km3. Proglacial lakes 
started forming in 1933 and the largest one, Jökulsárlón, is now 13-15 km2 and up to 190 
m deep. An estimated annual sedimentary production of 3-4 million m3 is now deposited 
within these lakes instead of being transported to the coast, resulting in coastal erosion of 
700 m during the last 85 years. An average costal erosion of 5-10 m/year now threatens 

the bridge, built in 1967 across the outlet river, Jökulsá, which is currently located 300 m 
from the shoreline.” 

Skaftafell 64 km < Jökulsárlón > Hofn 78 km. 

“As you travel around the south side of Öræfajökull you will pass many outlet glaciers. 
It is worth stopping at Kvíárjökull to hike up onto the sharp-ridged lateral moraines that 
grade into a terminal moraine breached by the glacial river. The terminal moraine is appr. 
100 m high – it is the highest terminal moraine in Iceland.” 

Kvíárjökull is an extension of Öræfajökull, the largest active post-glacial volcano in 
Iceland. Its north-western rim is Hvannadalshnukur, the highest peak (2119 m, 6,952 ft) 
in Iceland. Its crater is 5 km wide and it has a rim averaging 1,850 m high.  Öræfajökull 
has erupted twice in historical times, in 1362 and again in 1727. The 1362 eruption was 
explosive and in regards to the amount of tephra produced, was the largest in Icelandic 
historical time. This eruption completely destroyed the district of Herad with jökulhlaup 
floods and tephra fall. By the 1400's a new settlement had sprung up again in this area
under the name of Öræfi meaning "wasteland" in Icelandic. In 1727 Oraefajokull erupted 
again explosively with similar affects, but the eruption was smaller than the one in 1362.

Landscape and distr ict between  the glacier and  the sea. Un til 1974, when the r ing road no. 1 was 
finished , it was one of the most isolated parts of Iceland. The name means “deser t” or “the waste 
land.” 
In the 14 th and 18 th century, volcanic eruptions destroyed many farms in  the area. 

Just east of the Skaftafell N.P. entrance is Svínafellslögin, a sediment sequence in the
root of the great Öræfajökull volcano. It is about 700 ka old, and contains fossils 
(primarily leaves) that record climate changes on Iceland through the Pleistocene. Here, 
elements of the deciduous broad-leave forest that characterized the Tertiary flora of 
Iceland occur for the last time in Iceland’s geological history. 

The Öræfajökull volcano 

Öræfajökull is the largest stratovolcano in Iceland, created during the last 0.8 Ma by 
entwined interaction of volcanism and glacial erosion. The volcano is made up of basaltic 
and andesitic lavas and hyaloclastites. Rhyolite is also abundant. Hvannadalshnúkur, 
Iceland´s highest point, is a rhyolitic peak rising above the north-west rim of the 14 km2 
summit caldera. Whereas the lower part of the Öræfajökull massif has been deeply 
dissected by glacial erosion, the upper, subglacial part of the volcanic cone is younger 
than the second last glaciation. 

Postglacial activity in the summit area seems to have been almost exclusively explosive 
and tephrochronological studies show that this activity was of limited extent and did not 
add much to the volume of the volcano. Several radial fissures reaching below the present 
ice cover have also been active in postglacial time and at least one lava flow reached the 
lowland plain at Kvíárjökull on the south-east side of the volcanic massif. 

Two historical eruptions in 1362 and 1727 are reported from the summit caldera of the 
volcano. About 30 cm of rhyolitic pumice were deposited along the southern plain in 
1362 and carried northwestwards in such masses that ships sailing by the Western Fjords 
could hardly make their way through it. 

Tephrachronological studies have supplemented the scant information supplied by the old 
annals. They show that the 1362 eruption occurred after a 500 years repose period and 
that the main tephra fall lasted only one or two days. The 1362 tephra forms a 7-10 cm 
thick layer in the Hornafjörður region and has been diagnosed from peat bogs in 
Scandinavia. The total eruption volume is estimated to have been about 10 km3, 
corresponding to ca.2 km3 of solid rhyolitic rock making it the largest plinian eruption in 
Europe since Monte Somma on Vesuvius destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 AD. 

The eruption was accompanied by catastrophic jökulhlaups (glacier bursts) that emerged 
from underneath the outlet glaciers on the west side of the massif. Some farms were 
destroyed by these floods, but the tephra fall caused more devastation. The tephra fall 
damaged rural settlements up to a distance of 70 km east of the volcano so that they were 
abandoned for several years. The prosperous rural settlement along the foot of the 
volcanic massif, inclusive of at least 30 farms, were laid waste so thoroughly that they 
remained abandoned for decades. When a revival at last came, this district (which before 
the eruption was called Hérað, a name given to extensive and important rural settlements)
was renamed Öræfi (“wasteland”). 

The second historic eruption of Öræfajökull occurred on 3 August 1727 and lasted until 
April or May 1728. On Sunday 3 August several earthquakes were felt during a church 
service at Sandfell. The seismic activity increased gradually and culminated the following 
morning with events of estimated intensity VII-IX on the Mercalli scale. At 9 a.m, three 
particularly loud thunders were heard that were almost instantly followed by tremendous 
jökulhlaups from the Falljökull and Rótarfjallsjökull glaciers. The jökulhlaups destroyed 
two chalets and drowned three people. The Svínafell and Skaftafell farms on the west
side of Öræfajökull were in complete darkness during 3 days due to tephra fall and 
became inhabitable for a while afterwards. However, the tephra production was small 
compared with that of the 1362 eruption and probably did not exceed 0.2 km3. The 
floods and tephra fall killed about 600 sheep and 150 horses some of which were found 
completely mangled by the bomb fall. The great amount of water discharged by the 
jökulhlaups indicate that the eruption originated within the caldera, but on 4 August a 
fissure with six or seven separate fires opened up on the outer west flank of the caldera, 
reaching down to about 1100 m a.s.l. Fire and smoke was seen at this site until late May 
the following year, but the lava production was insignificant. 

On August 11th, 1794 the Icelandic naturalist, Sveinn Pálsson climbed Öræfajökull with 
two companions. Sveinn Pálsson conducted glaciological research in Iceland during 
1792-1794 following his graduation from the University of Copenhagen. In 1795, he 
submitted a manuscript of a treatise on Icelandic glaciers to the Society of Natural 
History in Copenhagen. The treatise was written in Danish and for a variety of reasons 
not published in full until 1945 and then in Icelandic. In his Glacier Account, Sveinn put 

forth his theory that glaciers behaved as fluids. A few years earlier, in 1775, the French 
naturalist, A. C. Bordier, studying glaciers in the French Alps in 1772, had reached the 
same conclusion. However, a century passed before his discovery became known. 

In his account Sveinn wrote; "I became particularly interested in the appearance of the 
nearest glacier to the east of Kvísker, the same outlet glacier mentioned before, that had 
slid down. Its surface, all the way to the main glacier, seemed to consist of nothing but 
semicircles running right across it [ogives], whose convex arches pointed downward to 
the level land, exactly as it had flowed down in a semi-melted or thick and viscous state. I 
wonder whether this phenomenon might not prove in part that glacier ice, without 
actually melting, has some kind of fluidity, like several resins."  (B. Brandsdóttir) 

---------------------------- DAY 6 (cont.) and DAY 7 ----------------------------

Skaftafell National Park 

Iceland’s second national park, Skaftafell, established in 1967 (400-500 square 
kilometres), contains some of the most precious natural pearls of the country. The rugged 
landscapes, mountains and glaciers, the flora and the fauna have a magnetic influence on 
the visitors. In 1984, the park was increased in area (1736 square kilometres) including a 
considerable part of Glacier Vatnajokull.  In November 2004 the area of the park was 
again increased, to 4,807 square kilometres.  It now comprises the volcano Laki area, as 
well as about half of Euorpe's largest icecap, Vatnajokull. 

There are no roads in the park, but a network of trails offers the opportunity for 
differently extended hikes. The camping grounds are large but it is difficult to hammer 
the tent pegs into the gravel surface. Among the services rendered in the park are toilets, 
washing machines, a restaurant, a small shop and a very interesting Visitors Centre. The 
park wardens offer regular guided walking tours and the Bus Company Austurleid hf., 
offers daily tours from the park to the volcanic Laki area as well as the daily schedule. A 
comprehensive brochure with maps and hiking trails is available at the Visitors'  Centre. 

According to Richie Williams, a hike to Svartifoss (flowing over columnar basalts) is “a 
must.” Helgi Torfason tells us, “If you have time (energy) walk into Morsárdalur and to 
the outlet of Skeiðará glacial river from beneath the glacier – ask the warden about the 
best way and if it is a good idea – the outlet changes.  The walk to Morsárjökull and into 
Kjós is also very interesting – or walk to Skaftárjökull glacer and moraines – or up to the 
mountains. Depends on weather what is best.” 

“The Skaftafell central volcano was active between 2-3 Ma. At least 16 glacial and 
interglacial intervals have been identified in the Skaftafell and Hafrafell volcanic strata 
during the last 5 Ma (Helgason and Duncan, 2001). The strata is made up of subaerially 
erupted tholeitic lava flows and basaltic andesites and subglacially formed volcanic 
ridges made up of pillow breccias and hyaloclastites. Magnetostratigraphic mapping and 
K-Ar radiometric dating indicate that the frequency and intensity of glaciations increased 

significantly at ca. 2.6 Ma and particularly since 0.8 Ma, as most of the strata from 100 m
a.s.l. to the peak of Öræfajökull, at 2119 m a.s.l. has been formed during the Bruhnes 
magnetic epoch. These climatic changes correlate with increases in global ice volume, 
ice-rafted debris, and development from local to regional glacial conditions in the North 
Atlantic.” (B. Brandsdóttir)

Iceland's hotspot volcanoes. 
“The center of the Iceland hotspot is marked by a cluster of subglacial central volcanoes 
beneath NW Vatnajökull. Tephra layers within the outlet glaciers indicate that the 
volcanic activity has a 130-140 yr period [Larsen et al., 1998] and that the eruption 
frequency of the hotspot volcanoes has been considerably higher than elsewhere at the 
plate boundary in Iceland, since 1200 A.D. Two of these volcanic systems, Grímsvötn 
and Bárðarbunga, have more than 50 documented eruptions among them the largest 
fissure eruptions in Iceland in historical times, i.e. the Vatnaöldur eruption in 871 (from 
the Bárðarbunga system) and the Grímsvötn-Laki eruptions during 1783-1785. 

Large calderas exist beneath both Bárðarbunga and Grímsvötn, whereas the Kverkfjöll 
volcanic system is characterized by two smaller calderas. Being subglacial has precluded 
conventional volcanological studies of these volcanoes until recently when modern 
techniques, such as radio echo-sounding and local earthquake monitoring [Björnsson and 
Einarsson, 1991] revealed their surface structure and provided more detailed information 
regarding their seismic activities. 

The Grímsvötn volcano is covered by a glacier and ice is continuously melted by 
geothermal heat the meltwater accumulates in a caldera lake. the lake is drained in 
jökulhlaups typically releasing volumes of the order of 2-5 km3 every 4-10 years. During 
these events the lake level subsides by the order of 100 m whereas it rises by 10-30 m/a 
in the interval between the jökulhlaups. The ice-covered caldera lake makes a unique 
calorimeter for measuring the heat flux of the subglacial geothermal area, which can be 
derived by the rate of accumulation of meltwater in the lake, subtracting water melted by 
atmospheric processes on the glacier surface. 

A 69 year record (1922-1991) of heat release has been obtained [Björnsson and 
Guðmundsson, 1993]. The data derived from in situ measurements of the volume of 
meltwater accumulated in the caldera lake, subtracting climatically induced melting. The 
overall fluctuations in the heat flux are closely related to volcanic activity and are 
dominated by a main pulse of 11,600 MW, caused by a major eruption in 1938, gradually 
declining to 1600 MW in 1976-1982. Heat extracted from the roof of a magma chamber, 
with the aid of hydrothermal convection, may have given a basic contribution to the heat 
flux of 1500 to 2000 MW (an upper bound). The variable part of the heat flux (from 0 to 
10,000 MW) was released from magma erupted at the base of the glacier and from 
shallow intrusions. The total heat released over the period 1922 to 1991 was 8.14+/-
1.6x10**18 J, equivalent to the energy released by the solidification and cooling of 21+/-

0.4 km3 of basaltic magma. The contribution to the total heat flux was 45% (max.) from 
a magma chamber, 35% (min.) from shallow intrusions, and 20% from eruptions. This 
implies that magma at the roof of a chamber solidified and cooled at the rate of 1.2-
1.6x10**7 m3/a or about 1 km3 over the last 69 years. Heat release at Grímsvötn was 
probably more intense in the 19th century when volcanic eruptions were more frequent.” 
(B. Brandsdóttir) 

-------------------------------- DAY 8 --------------------------------

On our drive back to Reykjavík we will cross two ridge segments, the propagating tip of 
the Eastern Volcanic Zone and the Western Volcanic Zone, and the transform between 
them, the South Iceland Seismic Zone. The route passes along the southern edge of the 
Vatnajökull and Mýrdalsjökull glaciers, which conceal some of Iceland's most active 
volcanoes. Throughout history subglacial eruptions have caused enormous flooding 
forming the great sandur alluvial plains along the coast. We will drive across the flanks of 
Mýrdalsjökull (Katla). The road also crosses the 1783 Laki lava, the largest historical 
lava flow in Iceland (565 km2 and 14 km3) and the flood planes of the subglacial 
volcanoes beneath Vatnajökull (Grímsvötn) and Mýrdalsjökull (Katla). 

Leaving Skaftafell, we cross most of the great Skeiðarársandur (the Skeiðarár glacier 
outwash plain), in front of Skeiðarárjökull. Along the coastal plain south of the road are 
fields of pseudocraters, where lava flows moved across saturated soils or marshland and 
created many "rootless" craters. Here we may see some signs of the great jökulhlaup that 
occurred in connection with an eruption in Grímsvötn beneath Vatnajökull, in 1996. 
“The 1000 km2 Skeiðarársandur alluvial plain has been generated by repeated 
jökulhlaups from the subglacial caldera lake of the Grímsvötn volcano and from ice-
dammed lakes at the glacier margin, such as the Grænalón lake at the western margin of 
Skeiðarárjökull. There are indications that the sandur was considerably smaller up to the 
14th century as at least 4 farms existed on its easternmost part prior to the 1362 eruption, 
including the Rauðilækur church. The last major jökulhlaup at Skeiðarársandur took 
place in November, 1996 following the subglacial Gjálp eruption. Meltwater from the 
eruption site flowed southwards into the caldera lake of Grímsvötn where it accumulated 
beneath a floating ice shelf. The lake's ice dam was lifted off the glacier bed 3 weeks 
after the eruption began and more than 3 km3 of water drained onto the Skeiðarársandur 
plain, causing extensive damage to transportation and communication systems.” (B. 
Brandsdóttir) 

Skeiðarársandur 

•	 Vast black sand deser t between  the districts Öræfi and F ljó tshverfi. 
•	 Approx. 20 by 30 km large, fed  from the g lacier Seiðarár jökull, a tongue of Vatnajökull. 
Sandurs (sand deser ts) have always presen ted problems for transport because of the destructive 
•	
forces of the glacial r ivers.  The r ing road no. 1 was no t completed until 1974. 
In 1996, after a volcan ic eruption underneath  the g lacier Vatnajökull a jöku lhlaup (an  immense 
outburst of g lacial water, mud and gravel) destroyed  the road and  the br idge over Skeiðará. Both 
were reconstructed  in 1997. 
•	 Do not leave the road, the sand desert is very dangerous!

“a lava-tounge from the 1783  lava from Laki is the f irst lava you cross af ter leav ing the

Skeiðarársandur – you cross the lava again after leav ing Kirk jubæjarklaustur.”


Kirkjubaejarklaustur 

Irish monks are believed to have lived there before the arrival of the Norse settlers.  In 
1186 a convent of the Benedictine order was established and used until 1550, when it was 
disbanded during the Reformation. In 1783, the village and its church were threatened by 
a lava stream coming from the Laki fissures. Many topographical names in the area 
remind of the catholic past, such as the freestanding rocky mound west of the hamlet, 
called Systrastapi, or the Sisters' Mound. Two nuns are said to be buried there after they 
were burned at the stake for their sins. 

This area contains a few of the most beautiful natural phenomena and landscapes of the 
country, including the “Kirkjugólf,” a flat rock pavement of basalt columns, looking like 
the floor of an old church. The great Eldhraun lava is found at Kirkjubaejarklaustur. It 
was produced in 1783 by an enormous eruption along the Laki crater row. In all, the lava 
covers about 599 km2, and is the most extensive lava field in the world resulting from a 
single eruption during historical times. The amount of eruptives (lava, pumice, ash, 
gases) has been estimated to be about 15 km3 during the 8 months of eruption. The 
volcanic pollution caused livestock to die, and there followed a famine that killed about 
1/4th of the Icelandic population at the time. The pollution caused haze over most of 
northern Europe. 

The Skaftár Fires 
“A devastation was brought about by the 1783-84 Laki (i.e. Skaftáreldar) eruption on the 
late 18th Century communities in Iceland. The resulting Haze Famine (i.e. 
Móðuharðindin) is the worst environmental and social-economic disaster in Iceland's 
history, killing 50% of the countries cattle, 77% of the sheep and one fifth of the human 
population. The Lakagígar lava flow is the largest lava flow formed on Earth in at least 
the last 1000 years. The average discharge during the first 50 days of the eruption may 
have been close to 2000 m3/s. The 565 km2 and 14 km3 lava flow formed two main 
branches that we will cross, driving back to Reykjavík.” (B. Brandsdottir) 

Vik 71 km <Kirkjubaejarklaustur> Skaftafell 69 km, Laki 51 km, Landmannalaugar 120 
km. 

Approaching Vik, we will be travelling west along the southern margins of one of the 
mightiest volcanos in Iceland, Katla, whose great caldera is buried below the 
Mýrdalsjökull ice cap. In Katla, there has been intensive volcanic activity with at least 17 
eruptions in historical times. The number of pre-historical eruptions are not known but 
may approach 100. It has been estimated that as much as 30-35 km3 of tephra may have 
been produced from this area during the post-glacial time. Associated with the subglacial 
eruptions are enormous catastrophic jökulhlaups, which may reach water volumes of 
>300.000 m3 per second (for comparison, top discharge from Icelandic glacal rivers 

during summer melt rarely exceeds 500 m3 per second). During Katla’s last major 
eruption in 1918, the shear volumes of debris carried by the jökulhlaup caused the 
coastline to move more than 4 km outwards. We will cross Mýrdalssandur, the huge, flat, 
black Katla outwash plane in front of Mýrdalsjökull, and see some of fingerprints of this 
enormous jökulhlaup (including Kötlubjarg (below) and large levee-formations. 

Katla 
“Radio-echo soundings have revealed a large caldera beneath the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap. 
The Katla caldera encircles an area of 100 km2, is 600 to 750 m deep and its highest rims 
reach 1380 m a.s.l. Katla is among the most frequently erupting volcanoes in Iceland, 
averaging about two eruptions each century. Typical Katla eruptions are accompanied by 
basaltic tephra fall, lightning and glacial floods (jökulhlaups) of meltwater, ice and 
volcanic debris. The subglacial Katla eruptions are accompanied by enormous laharic 
floods that have formed a vast sandur plain and are widely distributed. Ocean sediments 
and ash particles in the Greenland ice core indicate strong activity over much longer time 
periods. 

The last eruption in Katla occurred in 1918 during which the southern coast was extended 
by 5 km by the laharic flood deposits. The present volcanic repose is among the longest 
known in historic times. Persistent high seismic activity has been observed beneath 
Mýrdalsjökull for more than four decades. No volcanic activity has been detected during 
this time, however, with the exception of probable small subglacial eruptions in 1955 and 
1999. Epicenters in 1978-1985 fall into two distinct clusters under the glacier. One 
cluster is located within the caldera of Katla, whereas the other is centered in the 
Goðabunga area, beneath and west of the western caldera rim. Earthquakes of both 
clusters have distinct characteristics of volcanic earthquakes, i.e. emergent P-waves and 
poor S-waves. These characteristics are more pronounced for the Goðabunga cluster. The 
coincidence of the Katla cluster with the caldera and an area of S-wave shadowing 
suggests that it is related to an active magma chamber of the Katla volcano.” (B. 
Brandsdottir) 

Vik 

This is the southernmost coastal hamlet of the country and the only one without a 
harbour. The flat, black beach south of the village was declared one of the 10 most 
beautiful island beaches of the world by the Iceland Magazine.  Amphibious vehicles are 
used for deep sea angling, fishing and highly interesting sightseeing tours along the 
coastline all the way to the country's southernmost point, Dyrholaey. There is also Travel 
Café Tourist Information Centre.  Large bird breeding colonies are on both sides of the 
village, arctic terns, puffins, guillemots, fulmars, kittiwakes etc. [Post-trip note: We were 
not able to reach this beach. The road was closed to protect nesting birds.] If you are 
travelling to the west from Vik, you should take a look at the current road and weather 
conditions on Moorland Vikurskard. 

Skogar  33 Km <Vik> Kirkjubaejarklaustur  71 km. 

The trip from Vik to Skogar will take us south of the Mýrdalsjökull and Eyjafjallajökull 
ice caps. We will visit the Sólheimajökull outlet glacier, easy to reach from the main 
road.  (Helgi Torfason: “You might smell the glacial river as you appoach – it is sulphur 
from geothermal wates, coming from beneath the glacier.”) Here, we can see proglacial 
sandur outwash, neoglacial moraines, and a recently (since 1995) deglaciated glacier 
forefield with flutes, drumlins and retreat moraines. Sólheimajökull is located on the 
southwestern margin of the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap and partly encompasses a subglacial 
volcanic caldera, from which Katla erupts and from which Kötlujökull flows out to the 
east-southeast.  Remnants of a minor jökulhlaup in 1999 (pitted outwash) as well as 
megaripples associated with major Holocene jökulhlaups in connection with large 
eruptions in the subglacial Katla caldera can be seen. 

Skogar 

Skogar is the common name for two farms, a school and the open air, communications 
and folk museum. The school and the museum were inaugurated in 1949. The school 
buildings are used as a summer hotel. The curator of the folk museum was the initiator of 
its foundation and he is responsible for its collection and development for more than 5 
decades. He is still going strong and enjoys showing the visitors around. Old houses have 
been restored and rebuilt on the museum grounds. The church is a replica of old country 
churches but the inside decorations are old artefacts from old, bygone churches. The 
church was consecrated by the Lutheran bishop in 1998. There had been no church at 
Skogar for more than two centuries, when that happened.  The alluvial plain south of 
Skogar shows us clearly, that it is possible to turn the grey gravel and sand deserts green 
again and down by the sea it is possible to spot the harbour seals tumbling in the water.

40-m high waterfall on  the river Seljalandsá, comes off a marine cliff carved dur ing high sea level

Seljalandsfoss sits near the eastern edge of the South Iceland Seismic Zone. 

The South Iceland Seismic Zone 
“The South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ) is a transform zone bridging the Western and 
Eastern Volcanic Zones. The SISZ crosses the populated lowland in South Iceland and 
has a width of about 60 km. Throughout the history of Iceland, the seismic zone had 
produced numerous destructive earthquakes delineated by areas of destruction and 
surface ruptures. The SISZ was hit by a series of earthquakes in June 2000, two of which 
caused considerable damage. The earthquakes follow the pattern of previous large 
historic earthquakes that have occurred at intervals ranging from 45 to 112 years. A long-
term forecast of the June 2000 earthquakes was based on this pattern. The sequence 
began on June 17 with a magnitude 6.5 event in the eastern part of the zone. This 
immediately triggered a flurry of activity along at least a 90 km-long stretch of the plate 
boundary to the west. A second mainshock of about the same magnitude occurred about 
20 km west of the first one on June 21. The mainshocks of the sequence occurred on N-S 
striking faults, transverse to the zone itself. The sense of faulting was right-lateral strike-
slip conforming to the model of "bookshelf faulting" for the SISZ. According to the 
model the left-lateral transform motion across the zone is accomplished by right-lateral 
motion along numerous parallel transverse faults and rotation of the blocks between 
them. The two mainshocks occurred on pre-existing faults and were accompanied by 
surface ruptures consisting primarily of en echelon tension gashes and push-up structures. 
The main zones of rupture were about 15 km long, and coincided with the epicentral 
distributions of aftershocks. Fault displacements were of the order of 0.1-1 m. Faulting 
along conjugate, left-lateral strike-slip faults also occurred, but was less pronounced than 
that of the main rupture zones. High acceleration was recorded by a network of strong-
motion accelerographs. The highest recorded acceleration was 0.84 g, recorded by an 
instrument in a bridge abutment 3 km from the source fault of the June 21 event. 
Indications of acceleration in excess of 1 g, such as overturned stones, were abundant in 
the source areas. In light of the high accelerations the damage to man-made structures 
was surprisingly low. About 20 houses were deemed unusable, but none of them 
collapsed. Damage was strongly correlated with age of the buildings. There were no 
casualties and very little injury to humans or animals. Large hydrological changes and 
other effects such as rockfalls, settling of soil and swamps were observed in a wide area 
surrounding the seismically active zone.” (B. Brandsdottir) 

Hvolsvollur 

The small town Hvolsvollur, one of the few inland towns, started developing in the 1930s 
when most of the streams and rivers in the Southwestern Lowlands had been bridged. 
The inhabitants base their livelihood mainly on services rendered to the agricultural 
surroundings, the manufacture of meat products for the domestic market and tourism. The 
town is situated in one of the most important Saga regions of the country, with some of 
the main stages of the renowned Njal's-Saga. Those who are interested in the Icelandic 
Sagas should not miss visiting the Njala Centre in town.  Salmon and trout fishing in the 
nearby rivers is very rewarding. The Bus company Austurleid/SBS ltd. offers daily tours 
to Thorsmork in summer, Saga tours in the area and scheduled services to the capital and 
all the way to Egilsstadir in the East.  If you are travelling to the east from Hvolsvollur, 
you should take a look at the current road and weather conditions in Mt Pass Vikurskard. 

The distance from the capital is about 106 km.

Hella 

This town started developing before the middle of the 20th century, when most of the 
rivers in the southwestern lowlands had been bridged. It is situated on the banks of one of 
the best salmon rivers of the country. Just southeast of the town is a race course where 
horse shows are held regularly. Every summer in July a popular family festival takes 
place there. The town offers a good hotel and cottages on the river banks, restaurants and 
all kinds of recreational opportunities, such as sightseeing tours, horse rentals, dog sledge 
tours and fishing.  East of town is an airfield, where The Gliders' Association holds 
competitions. 

36 km Selfoss <Hella> Hvolsvollur 13 km, Hrauneyjar, 96 km. 

Selfoss 

The town Selfoss started developing in 1891, when a suspension bridge was built across 
the most voluminous river in Iceland, Olfusa. This bridge collapsed in 1944 and a new 
one was constructed immediately. The community was strengthened in 1930, when a co-
operative shop and dairy were established. 

Hveragerdi 12 km, <Selfoss> Hella 36 km,  Reykjavik 57 km. 

Hveragerdi 

The present horticultural and greenhouse town Hveragerdi started developing in 1902, 
when a carding factory was built by the waterfall Reykjafoss. The natural thermal area in 
the centre of town was harnessed for heat greenhouses and dwellings. Nowhere else in 
the country are there more greenhouses in one spot than in Hveragerdi. Many people 
living in the capital area make weekend trips to the town to buy flowers, tomatoes, 
cucumbers and other vegetables. The farmers have prolonged the growing period with 
artificial lightning and thus limited the need for import of these products during winter. 
Many foreign visitors are quite astonished to see the inhabitants walking about taking 
care of their daily chores with all this boiling hot water under their feet and the earth 
shaking every now and then.  All services for tourists are rendered in the town and many 
recreational opportunities are on offer. The town also boasts of a very good hotel with a 
golf course, a health resort and good trout and char rivers in the area. Many renowned 
artists and authors live in town. 

To the south, we may be able to see Vestmannaeyjar and the island of Heimaey, where 
the 1974 eruption caused the town to be abandoned for a few months.  Surtsey is too far 
south to be seen from the coastal plain, but can be seen (with binoculars) from the 
mountain road above Hveragerði on the way to Reykjavík. 

On the drive back to Reykjavik we will cross the northernmost part of the Reykjanes 
Peninsula south of the Hengill central volcano.  Where we cross, it is called the 
Hellisheidi highland, and is a beautiful landscape of extensive lava fields, active and 
extinct volcanoes and crater rows.

Reykjanes Peninsula 

Before departing Keflavik Airport on our final day, we will drive across the lowlands of 
southern Iceland, and out to the south coast of the Reykjanes Peninsula oblique rift zone, 
where the mid-Atlantic Ridge comes onshore. We may also drive by the Krísuvík 
geothermal area on the southwestern side of Keifarvatn, a graben lake whose level has 
shifted in response to earthquakes in recent years.  Also on the south side of the lake is 
Grænavatn, a maar.

History 
The first permanent settler of Iceland was Ingolfur Arnarson, a Norwegian Viking who in 
874 AD made his home where Reykjavik now stands. In 930 AD, the Viking settlers of 
Iceland founded one of the world's first republican governments. They established a 
constitution based on individual freedom, land ownership, and sophisticated inheritance 
laws. In the year 1000, Icelandic-born Leifur Eiriksson (Leif Eriksson, sometimes called 
"Leif the Lucky") became the first European to set foot in North America. On another 
Viking expedition a couple of years later, Icelander Gudrid Thorbjarnardottir had a son, 
Snorri, who became the first child of European descent to be born in America. The Old 
Commonwealth Age, described in the classic Icelandic Sagas, lasted until 1262, when 
Iceland lost its independence. In 1918 it regained independence and in 1944, after 
centuries of domination by Norway and Denmark, Iceland became an independent 
republic. Iceland remains outside the EU and is a member of NATO. Iceland has no 
armed forces. Icelanders are divided over the presence of US troops that have been 
stationed in the country without a break since World War II. In 1985 Iceland declared 
itself a nuclear-free zone. The country is governed by the Althing (Parliament), whose 63 
members are elected every four years. Elections every four years are also held for the 
presidency; President Grimsson was elected in June 2000 for the second time. 

Energy 
Situated on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Iceland is a hot spot of geothermal activity. Thirty 
post-glacial volcanoes have erupted in the past two centuries, and natural hot water 
supplies much of the population with cheap, pollution-free heating. Rivers, too, are 
harnessed to provide inexpensive hydroelectric power.

Economy 
The economy is heavily dependent upon fisheries, which are the nation's greatest 
resource. 72% of all exports are made up of seafood products. Yet only a small 
proportion of the workforce is active in this sector (4.4% in fishing and 5.6% in fish 
processing). About 66% of the workforce is employed in services. Icelanders enjoy one 
of the highest standards of living in the world. 

The currency is the Icelandic krona (IKr).  1 krona is equal to 100 “aurar.” 
100 Icelandic krona ≈ $1.35 - $1.40 US 

“Coins are in denominations of 100 kr., 50 kr., 10 kr., 5 kr., and 1 kr. Bank notes are in 
denominations of 5000 kr., 2000 kr., 1000 kr., and 500 kr. All Icelandic banks provide

Language 
The Icelanders still speak the language of the Vikings (Old Norse). When new words are 
needed, they simply coin words that are combinations or modifications of old words. 
Iceland is alone in upholding another Norse tradition: the custom of using patronyms 
rather than surnames. If, for example, Einar has a son named "Petur", the son's name is 
Petur Einarsson (Peter Einar's Son). If Einar has a daughter whom he names "Margret", 
she becomes Margret Einarsdottir (Margaret Einar's Daughter). Members of the same 
family can therefore have different "last names," which often causes confusion to 
foreigners. If you are looking for someone in the phone directory, you look them up by 
their first name. 

Knowing a few Icelandic words will help you understand the place names: 
ár - river, stream 
dalur - valley 
heidi – hill 
sandur – outwash plain 
gljufur - canyon 
fjörður – fiord 
vellir - plain

The following is adapted from http://phwibbles.com/sagas/ 

“The Icelandic Sagas were written between the 12th and 13th centuries. They 
document either the lives of specific people (as in Egil's Saga) or whole communities (as 
in Laxdaela Saga, or Eyrbyggja Saga). Most, but not all, of the Sagas were written 
anonymously. The Heimskringla, a book chronicling the lives of Norwegian kings, is 
known to be written by Snorri Sturluson, one of Iceland's most prolific writers. Most 
sagas are quasi-historical texts; the subjects they treat were orally passed down many 
centuries before finally being written down, and therefore can not necessarily be 
considered perfectly authentic historical documents; for example, some of the Sagas, 
such as Eyrbyggja Saga, contain many instances of supernatural events that are obviously 
fantastic. 
“The nature of these texts can sometimes be humorous; Icelanders reveled in the 
strength of their women and warriors. All battles and hardships they endured with little 
regard to their own mortality, usually for the sake of honor, can be rendered in a 
positively sanguine and decidedly dark humor, not unlike tales of ancient Sparta. But 
more generally, the Sagas arouse heroic interest. From the menacing Viking warrior-poet 
Egil of Egil's Saga, the warring and ultimately tragic young foster-brothers Kjartan and 
Bolli of Laxdaela Saga, to the levelheaded, prophetic lawyer Njal of Njal's Saga, the cast 
of characters that populate these ancient texts are as interesting and respectable as any of 
ancient and medieval history's most famous literary figures: the titular Beowulf, Homer's 
Achilles, any of the various Arthurian knights, the list goes on. 
“As literature, the sagas are held in high esteem, but are relatively plain when 
compared to both contemporaneous and later medieval works that, like Sir Gawain and 
the Green Knight and Beowulf, often made use of ornate verse and fanciful poetry. 
Instead, the Sagas, being more recorded for the sake of posterity than literature, are 
written in a very matter-of-fact and conservatively succinct prose accessible to all levels 
of readers. A subject any number of romantic authors could spend wordy pages on, an 
Icelandic writer could summarize in a single objective sentence. 
“For an American, medieval Icelandic culture and society has an added interest due 
to the similarities between the historical American west and Iceland. Both types of 
settlers (between the American west and Iceland) were of the same intent. Each sought, 
most importantly, to find abundant lands on which to build homes and, generally, both, 
free of any imperial governance, relied on no one but themselves to distribute justice and 
defend what they saw as their right to live and prosper through their own labor. 
“During the time of these Sagas, Iceland was a country free of ultimate governmental 
rule, unlike Norway and other monarchial countries. The central aspect of the Icelandic 
republic was an annual assembly called the Althing. This was the biggest event of the 
year, held for about 2 weeks in the month of June. Estate holders, or Chieftains, had all of 
the power to decide judicial and legislative issues at this event, though the Chieftains' 
ruling power depended on the voluntary allegiance of their supporters, the freeholding 
farmers. Iceland itself was populated mostly by Norwegians who left their country in 

hopes of finding better and more abundant farming lands. Others fled to Iceland from 
Norway to evade the monarchy there. 
“Some of the Sagas recount the discovery and first populators of Iceland (i.e. 
Laxdaela Saga, Book of Settlements). At this time, the people were Pagans, worshipping 
the old Norse Gods, such as Odin, Thor, and Frigga. Around the turn of the century, from 
late 10th to the early 11th centuries, Christianity began to spread into Norway, and soon 
word of this new religion reached Iceland. In the early parts of the 11th century, Iceland 
converted to Christianity, which is described in detail in some of the Sagas, including 
Njal's Saga, where the title character has much to do with the decision, though such a 
depiction is probably mostly fictional.” 

To give you a flavor of one of the sagas, here is the opening of the The Ynglinga Saga,

originally written in Old Norse, about 1225 A.D., by the poet and historian Snorri

Sturluson. The English translation is by Samuel Laing (1844).

This passage gives you an idea of the Medieval Icelandic view of the countries of the

world – a geography lesson, if you will.


OF THE SITUATION OF COUNTRIES

Part 1 of The Ynglinga Saga

Snorri Sturluson


It is said that the earth's circle that the human race inhabits is torn across into many 
bights, so that great seas run into the land from the out-ocean. Thus it is known that a 
great sea goes in at Narvesund [the Straits of Gibraltar], and up to the land of Jerusalem. 
From the same sea a long sea-bight stretches towards the north-east, and is called the 
Black Sea, and divides the three parts of the earth; of which the eastern part is called 
Asia, and the western is called by some Europa, by some Enea.  Northward of the Black 
Sea lies Swithiod [Russia] the Great, or the Cold.  The Great Swithiod is reckoned by 
some as not less [in size] than the Great Serkland [Northern Africa]; others compare it to 
the Great Blueland [Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa].  The northern part of Swithiod lies 
uninhabited on account of frost and cold, as likewise the southern parts of Blueland are 
waste from the burning of the sun.  In Swithiod are many great domains, and many races 
of men, and many kinds of languages.  There are giants, and there are dwarfs, and there 
are also blue men, and there are any kinds of stranger creatures.  There are huge wild 
beasts, and dreadful dragons. On the south side of the mountains that lie outside of all 
inhabited lands runs a river through Swithiod, which is properly called by the name of 
Tanais [Russia’s Don River], but was formerly called Tanaquisl, or Vanaquisl, and which 
falls into the Black Sea. The country of the people on the Vanaquisl was called Vanaland, 
or Vanaheim; and the river separates the three parts of the world, of which the eastermost 
part is called Asia, and the westermost Europe.
