***** Seminar Topic: ICE! *****
In this year's Geodynamics Seminar, we will explore the depth and breadth of
scientific research related to Earth's present and past ice-sheets, glaciers
and sea-ice, as well as extraterrestrial planetary ice.
Invited speakers have been chosen from experts in the current frontiers in ice-
related research, including planetary ice, climate records from polar and
tropical ice cores, the Snowball Earth, subglacial volcanoes, ice rheology, ice
sheet modeling, ice microkinetics, glacial erosion and tectonics, subglacial
life and polar remote sensing.
A field trip to Iceland in Summer 2006 will allow us to view some of the
island's ice caps and glacial geology, the exposed mid Atlantic Ridge and
evidence of ice-volcano interactions.

***** Grading *****
Joint Program students enrolled in the Geodynamics seminar are required to
complete a project for the class. This includes research, an oral presentation
during the last two or three seminar meetings, and a written paper due at the
end of the semester. For first and second year students, the project must be on
a topic related to the theme of the seminar and must be different from their
main research interest. For more advanced students, the topic may be closely
related to their dissertation research.
