Briefing How-To                     

Slide 1

A briefing is not a speech

(cid:131) A briefing is an interactive presentation, 
focused on helping decisionmakers learn from 
your analysis of a complex problem or 
opportunity.
(cid:131) It cannot be scripted formally like a speech, but 
it can and should be well-structured.
(cid:131) In general, you control the focus, but the 
briefees may ask you to change the sequence, 
go back to a key point, or otherwise help them 
learn, and this is the very purpose. These are 
opportunities for you, not a sign of problems.

Slide 2

The tasks

(cid:131) Know your audience
(cid:131) Be clear on the purpose(s) of the briefing and 
the context (location, time, timing vis-à-vis 
decisions or actions that follow)
(cid:131) Carry out your analysis and prepare 
recommendations
(cid:131) Decide on your core messages
(cid:131) Structure the briefing effectively
(cid:131) Create visual elements as part of your message
(cid:131) Practice, practice, practice
(cid:131) Deliver responsively

Slide 3

1. Know the audience and context

(cid:131) Make-up: 
Race/ethnicity? 
Gender? Generation? 
Professional culture or 
affiliation? Size? 
Political attitudes or 
loyalties? Education 
level? Economic status?
(cid:131) Context: How does your 
briefing fit into a 
sequence of analysis 
and action? Whose 
action?

(cid:131) Middle 

(cid:131) End

(cid:131) Summarize the 
issues/questions
(cid:131) Supply the 
recommendations

Slide 5

Begin with the end in mind

(cid:131) Purpose of the briefing 

(cid:131) Recommendations

(cid:131) Roadmap – what structure do you use?

Slide 6

Middle: Presenting the analysis

(cid:131) Inductive Reasoning
(cid:131) Put the bottom line on top
(cid:131) Use with reasonably receptive audiences
(cid:131) D = A + B + C
(cid:131) Deductive Reasoning
(cid:131) Build the case, up toward conclusions
(cid:131) “Mystery novel” approach: what happens next?
(cid:131) Use with more skeptical or hostile audiences
(cid:131) A + B + C = D

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 7

Middle: Choose a structure

(cid:131) Cause/Effect
(cid:131) Problem/Solution
(cid:131) Categories or elements of the problem
(cid:131) Questions/Answers
(cid:131) Chronological: emphasize historical 
background, current “state of play,”
alternative futures

Slide 8

Begin and end with your message

(cid:131) Highlight Major 
Points

Slide 10

Overview

(cid:131) The hub-and-spoke is a well-tested structure for 
briefings aimed at busy decisionmakers.
(cid:131) The “hub” is your core message(s), expressed 
in simple, action-oriented language. It’s the 
heart of what you want listeners to remember.
(cid:131) The “spokes” are the components of the 
message, which lend supporting evidence or 
illustration.
(cid:131) Each member of the team should be able to 
move the listener from hub to spoke (or vice-
versa), as needed, at any point in the briefing.

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 11

Whatever structure you choose, you will 
need to tell the audience a story, in part 
with visuals …

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 12

3. Visual storytelling

(cid:131) The purpose of visual elements is to enhance 
comprehension and retention of important 
ideas. If a slide does not add value, drop it.
(cid:131) Except in highly design-oriented or marketing-
oriented presentations, the main purpose is not 
to entertain the audience per se, though 
creating visual interest helps engage us.
(cid:131) The visuals and spoken remarks should be well 
aligned. This is the concept of a “visual 
storyboard” (outline) to help you sync the two.

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 13

Creating the visual elements

(cid:131) Keep them simple
(cid:131) Average attention span
per slide is 8 seconds
(cid:131) Most audiences can handle
about 1 slide per minute
of briefing
(cid:131) Simplify technical concepts with metaphor

The stretching of vorticity
is a difficult physical 
concept, but comparing it 
to a skater's conservation 
of momentum helps to 
clarify what we mean

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 14

Visual arguments need evidence

(cid:131) Present evidence
(cid:131) Teach with evidence
(cid:131) Convince with 
evidence

Image quality matters

(cid:131) Consider size: make images legible, 
intuitive, easily grasped 
(cid:131) Choose colors with care: simpler is often 
better (less distracting)
(cid:131) Make quantitative data accessible: Use 
minimum 16-point font (general rule), use 
only the data you need.
(cid:131) Don’t include inappropriate visuals and 
then apologize for them during the 
briefing.

Focus on the overall composition

(cid:131) What is the eye drawn to?
(cid:131) Where does the reader want to focus?
(cid:131) “Less is more”: use a few simple 
elements to make a point

Slide 24

Message content: Emotional arguments

(cid:131) Use them sparingly, consider the 
audience’s receptiveness
(cid:131) Have a single message
(cid:131) Appeal to our values
(cid:131) Create emotion: Outrage? Wonder? 
Delight?
(cid:131) Move us to action
(cid:131) Include evidence and examples (reason + 
emotion = powerful persuasion)

Slide 25

4. Deliver the briefing

(cid:131) Focus and center yourself
(cid:131) Show enthusiasm for 
your subject
(cid:131) Be yourself—don’t imitate 
others’ styles
(cid:131) Don’t read us a script—
memorize your main 
points, keep notes at 
hand if you like.
(cid:131) Project your voice so we 
can hear and engage with 
the topic

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 26

Preparing and handling questions

(cid:131) Preparing: What doubts is the listener likely to 
have? Where will they want details or extra 
evidence? Where might they challenge us?
(cid:131) During the briefing: Listen carefully. If you’re 
unsure about the question, summarize it and 
check
(cid:131) Listen actively (nod, make eye contact, 
acknowledge)
(cid:131) Answer the question and move on
(cid:131) If you don’t know or aren’t sure, say so; offer to 
check the facts and follow up, if appropriate.

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 27

Rehearse

(cid:131) Practice and time the briefing at least 
three (3) times: The dry run is one.
(cid:131) Get feedback 
(cid:131) Content: Is it clear? What’s persuasive and 
what’s not?
(cid:131) Structure: Is it working for you? Is there a better 
way?
(cid:131) Delivery: Is your body supporting the message or 
distracting the audience? Voice effective?
(cid:131) What are the main ways we can improve?

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 28

Rehearse

If you’re on the 
sidelines: maintain 
professional 
composure. You’re 
always “on.”
If you’re speaking, 
channel your 
energy, avoid 
distracting 
gestures.

Connect with the audience

(cid:131) Use the terms that your audience knows
(cid:131) Use examples to explain new ideas
(cid:131) Engage the audience
(cid:131) Establish eye contact; look at people not the screen
(cid:131) Use friendly hand gestures
(cid:131) Speak to specific individuals if you know them

Slide 30

Connect with your audience

(cid:131) A briefing is two-way communication
(cid:131) Pay attention to audience reaction
(cid:131) Modify your talk as needed (are they listening or 
doing something else?)
(cid:131) Look for nods, smiles and other cues to determine 
if your message is being received.
(cid:131) Direct your answer to a question to the person 
who posed it. Interact naturally, conversationally.

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 31

How do you look?

(cid:131) Where to Stand?
(cid:131) If you need to pick a place to stand, make sure you’re 
out of the projection line.
(cid:131) Mediate between screen and audience: Direct our 
attention, you control the focus.
(cid:131) How to Speak?
(cid:131) Project, Project, Project – Practice
(cid:131) Pause after complicated ideas
(cid:131) Avoid a “canned” sound: Don’t rely on a speech script, 
have a well-informed conversation with the listeners.

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 32

The briefing doesn’t live on the screen

(cid:131) Don’t read the screen
(cid:131) Say more than you 
show
(cid:131) Handout more than 
you say
(cid:131) Leave paper trail: 
important audiences 
may not be able to 
attend

Briefing How-To                     

Slide 33

Finish strong

(cid:131) Try to recap your primary message
(cid:131) If culturally appropriate: Thank the 
decisionmakers (or other audience 
members) for their time and attention.
(cid:131) Offer to take questions (or more 
questions).
(cid:131) During Q&A: Use your extra slides (not 
shown during main briefing), if 
appropriate, to extend or clarify your 
arguments, teach the audience more.
Briefing How-To                     
Slide 34

Special tips to teams

(cid:131) Keep disagreements in perspective: different 
team members will have different instincts 
about some things;
(cid:131) Don’t focus on dividing up “air time” (speaking 
time) evenly—focus on whatever will best 
inform the audience, be flexible.
(cid:131) The team is always “on”: Even the members on 
the sidelines should reflect the team’s 
professionalism, avoid distracting side 
conversations or body language (e.g. fidgeting). 
(cid:131) Decide who will handle what questions and who 
will “direct traffic” (coordinate) to avoid 
awkward pauses
