Your Team Briefing: Feedback and Grade 
 
THIS IS A VERY DETAILED FEEDBACK MEMO 
 

Team X (student names removed) 
 
Our feedback and evaluation (course grade) covers your briefing, visual aids, and 
handout, though the feedback below focuses on the first two elements. 
 
Briefing (content and delivery) 
 
You tackled and sharpened a number of things between the dry run and the final 
briefing, including what had been: ineffective treatment of community organization 
and stakeholder process issues; and several distracting delivery problems, such as 
a lack of eye contact and posture and positioning flaws. 
 
You delivered a final briefing with a number of key strengths: an early orientation 
to the site and its planning history (clear and appropriately brief, cleverly 
punctuated with “… done in 2006 and never implemented”); a provocative 
assessment, right after, in “why not implemented” (the most pointed and clear we 
saw); an early roadmap in the multi-dimensional “development agenda” slide and 
remarks; slides that met the “stand-alone” test better than most in the class; well-
labeled and annotated maps that helped you convey powerful spatial ideas simply 
and quickly; a clear and economical presentation of what in the current plan should 
be adopted and championed versus what should be modified (something the 
briefees struggled to get out of at least half the other teams); effective assessment 
of the AGENCY's track record, including enforcement failures; a financing focus, 
including the complex but powerful notion of self-finance, which stood out as a 
distinctive element of the briefing and was perhaps the most thorough effort in the 
class to address the “fundability” question in the assignment scope; and generally 
energetic as well as poised delivery (details below) by knowledgeable speakers. 
 
Other areas, we and the briefees noted, could have been stronger: 
•  The core recommendations constitute a well-rounded and ambitious 
agenda, but it could have been better presented. But the elements of the 
agenda range from long-run outcomes (“create an identifiable destination”) to 
start-up action steps (“facilitate creation of a stakeholder organization”). So the 
logic of parallelism could be stronger here, and rethinking that logic would have 
led you to an important enhancement: what should come first on this very 
ambitious agenda? And what next, building on the momentum or foundations 
laid? And so on. Student A’s response to Xav’s question suggested that the team 
might not have thought beyond “getting it all done as a package.” And the 
mayor’s question about integration likewise raised this issue. Finally, we liked 
the core theme of “community development balanced with creating a 
destination.” That idea came out too subtle and wordy. You needed a revision to 

Page 1 of 5 

make it more catchy and accessible, such as “Build a community, not just a 
destination,” perhaps? Nevertheless, this was a thoughtful wrangling with what’s 
at stake on the OurTown waterfront and how the mayor should approach it. 
Notes below that particular slide would have explicated that central concept. 
•  The message on stakeholder organization remained a weaker element 
of the briefing. The main slide is a muddle of oddly coupled ideas (e.g., the 
principle “don’t forget physical development” follows the action recommendation 
“form a stakeholder-driven community organization”). You also recommend 
actively listening to OurTown stakeholders but don’t indicate, on the slides that 
is, who they are or what key interests or past conflicts are at issue (your 
responsive handling of questions about those issues compensated somewhat, 
and the appendix is rich but not a substitute for clear handling in the main 
briefing). Given that a recently elected mayor thinks naturally in terms of 
stakeholders, support, and conflict, this was a real shortcoming. Also, you’d 
want to clearly distinguish your “stakeholder-driven community organization” 
from the nonprofit partnership organization in the current plan—or identify their 
parallels, as appropriate. This element needed rethinking and a different 
presentation approach. 
•  On questioning, “regulation” was an awkward framing of the varied 
challenges and functions associated with “who will implement,” some of 
which had nothing to do with regulation or its enforcement. The 
underlying logic seemed to be that implementation is about enforcing an official 
plan, whereas the partnership concept and the need for both public and private 
money belie that outdated conception of planning. “Accountability” is a much 
more appropriate concept for public-private collaboration, and one element of 
that is formal regulation. But your slides offered an important, concise 
assessment of the AGENCY’s past failures and capacity problems and helpfully 
recommended (a) developing regulations collaboratively and then (b) expanding 
the AGENCY’s enforcement capacity and enhancing its performance. 
•  You needed to edit the self-finance message and slides some more to 
make the main idea, not the secondary advice to do market 
assessments, stand out. From our standpoint, the main idea was about how 
to use public money to prime the pump of a savvy public-private financing to 
yield both capital investment and operational funds. Still, the reminder about 
assessing the market was useful. 

 
As for delivery effectiveness, Student A’s strengths were strong and well-paced 
voice (animating, energetic), which is important for the start of a nighttime 
briefing, where audience attention and energy are major concerns. Plus poise in the 
body (solid, non-distracting posture). Your eye contact was generally ok, except 
where you used the slide as a notecard, as on the “why not implemented” 
message/slide. You want to avoid this, most of all in the opening minutes, because 
not having to read off your slides tends to be read (unconsciously) by the listener 
as a proxy for preparedness and confidence in your own message. In addition, with 
practice, you want to work on making eye contact with a variety of listeners; you 
seemed rather rigidly pointed in one direction. And watch the um’s and uh’s. In the 

Page 2 of 5 

end, we remember relatively simple ideas, and your word choice was effective. But 
don’t try to hit a script. Try to think of it as a conversation. It will also let you 
explore a repertoire of gestures to add expressive power and energy to your ideas. 
Keeping your hands behind your back was preferable to distracting gestures, 
though. 
 
Student B, your strengths include strong eye contact, poised posture, and fluid, 
varied gestures, which were particularly important for the very spatial elements you 
presented. Your voice was reasonably well paced, as well: quick and just bordering 
on rapid fire at times, with good range for emphasis. You need to be able to 
manage that pace, as you tend to speak as quickly as your mind is recalling the 
ideas, and the audience often needs to play catch-up. But your style conveyed 
expertise as well as an enthusiasm for the team’s arguments. On a different note, 
the slides tracked presenters well throughout the briefing, and your doubling as a 
presenter and slide manager reflected individual strengths but also the team’s 
preparedness. 
 
Student C, clear and well-paced voice (with only a few um’s) and poised posture 
are real strengths for you. Your eye contact was generally strong, though you did 
some extraneous looking back at slides when you could have, if pointing/directing 
was the idea, have walked back to and stood alongside the slide image to highlight 
key elements. You should also have positioned yourself about a step to the right, to 
stay out of the projection line and make it easier for you to direct our attention to 
the slides without pivoting 180 degrees around and standing between us and the 
slide. You gesture naturally and animate the material with your gestures. You can 
work on their range. Finally, beware the tendency to end your statements with an 
increase in vocal pitch that suggests a question or uncertainty rather than a 
persuasive statement. That tonal pattern tends to be read as less definitive and 
credible. 
 
Student D, well-modulated vocal pace (quick enough to engage but with helpful 
pauses to emphasize ideas and let us digest them) is a real strength, and so is your 
vocal range. Where speech is concerned, you want to watch the eh’s, which you 
intersperse frequently (the solution is usually to pause in those moments instead, 
and having a friend signal you in a practice run is the sure cure). Your posture was 
poised and solid, eye contact was strong, and you use fluid, varied gestures 
naturally to emphasize points and direct attention to the slide image. Referring us 
to the appendix for details was a nice touch. 
 
Student E, your strengths include vocal range and pace (very clear, sharp with 
distinctions, natural pausing). You also had strong eye contact, which was 
especially important since you were speaking partially from behind the console and 
managing your own slides, and fluid, varied gestures that helped tell the story. 
 
Student F, you had a solid posture and eye contact. Particularly because you’re tall, 
gestures are something to work on: They would animate your ideas. And so would 
more vocal range. The pace was fine, but you can work on animating and varying 
the vocal pitch to add emphasis, distinguish ideas.

Visual aids (slides and handout) 

Your visuals were generally well constructed, with consistent layout, not too much 
text, and well integrated photos, very well labeled maps, and other strengths. 
 
Some visuals were very good and could be excellent with minor editing. Take 
“Dispersing public destinations,” for example. Bullets 2 to 4 read logically from the 
subject in the title (these are things that dispersing is meant to accomplish). But 
the first bullet doesn’t follow that logic, even though it’s a related idea. Plus, 
assume a somewhat tired, easily distracted listener: Plain language is usually 
preferable, for nonspecialists, to shorthand categories (e.g., “shops” instead of 
“retail”). Revised, the slide might look like this: 
 

We propose dispersing public destinations on the waterfront 
 
- To encourage the public to walk the length of the Harborwalk; 
 
- To encourage economic development (restaurants, shops, etc.); 
 
- To discourage vacant property (fill “gaps” and remove eyesores); 
and 
 
-To make OurTown (as a whole) an engaging destination, linked to 
waterfront. 

 
or this … 
 

OurTown should be the destination, so … 
 
We propose dispersing public destinations on the waterfront. 
 
- To encourage the public to walk the length of the Harborwalk and 
link it to the Town; 
 
- To encourage economic development (restaurants, shops, etc.); and 
 
- To discourage vacant property (fill “gaps” and remove eyesores). 

 
The first Self Finance slide (the triangle) is rich and engaging. Some listeners tune 
out at these ambitious, very conceptual slides. But we all liked this. “Community” is 
an incredibly elastic term and you should perhaps use “Neighborhood groups” if 
that is what you meant. 
 
The second Self Finance needs some editing to simplify it (make it less visually 
busy and complex) and thereby make 1-2 key points stand out. A more complex 
version could be in your Appendix, for example, with notes below to tell a story.

Finally, we’re not sure the yin-yang image communicates very clearly your hopes 
about something as complex as decision structure. Visual thinking is good, but two 
lines of text with a support image might have been clearer: 
 

Physical development: AGENCY leads decisions, enforcement, and 
financial structuring, with stakeholder input; 
 
Cultural development: Other stakeholders lead decisions and 
programming, with AGENCY support for enforcement and more. 

 
Your score and grade 
 
In scoring each group, we weighed substantive argumentation first and foremost, 
considering delivery only to the extent that it related directly to your effectiveness 
as argument makers. We considered visuals as an additional element, weighing 
content much more heavily than use. Xav reviewed notes on your effectiveness 
from the dry run and final briefings, compared feedback and ratings by guest 
briefees and other observers (including MCP2s), and mined additional notes from a 
review of your video. 
 
We did not grade on a curve but rather on an absolute standard: How well did the 
workproducts reflect mastery of course concepts and meet professional standards? 
The mean and median scores were 92, and the grade range was: A (93 and up), A- 
(90 to 92), and B+ (85 to 89). Contact Xav with any questions.
