Feedback on Team Briefings 
 
Case: Public housing redevelopment 
 
Team “Z” 
 
Our evaluation covers your briefing, visual aids, and handout, though the 
feedback below may offer more on one of those than the other elements. 
 
Briefing (content and delivery) 
 
Student A’s intro was crisp, clear, and engaging. But physical positioning of 
the team was a problem: She seemed hidden behind other team members 
who “lurked” near the briefees. You need to minimize distractions and place 
the focus on the speaker and the visuals. 
 
The logic of the briefing was interesting: Tenant engagement is the 
foundation (not an after-thought), and it enables physical design tools to 
make a difference. The team didn’t come back to the core message enough, 
reliant as most of you were on a “script” (written notes). And the two 
halves—physical and non-physical—could have been much better integrated 
(this was true for almost every team). 
 
Student B, your early points were the clearest, but relying as you did on 
your notes, you missed an opportunity to connect with the audience. Also, 
watch the wonk-ish 1  jargon: “facilitate accountability and reciprocity.” It was 
tricky to see the connection between some of these points and the slides 
(see below), too—a problem that affected several presenters. One slide per 
main point might have helped us “button” the two together. 
 
Student C’s most effective contributions were in response to questions, 
extemporaneous (unscripted), in exchange with Xav. Again, this is the 
opportunity in a briefing—to create a conversation that informs or teaches 
important points—and not a sign of shortcomings. Student C’s explanation 
of risks in various engagement strategies signaled preparedness, more than 
the easy answers that aren’t credible (in the field) any more. But on repeated 
questioning, try not to aim for the one right answer. You’re not being tested. 
You’re in an informed conversation with stakes for real decisions: Explore the 
options with the briefee. You don’t need to know everything. 
 

                                       
1 “Wonk” is an idiom. It’s “know” spelled backward. In the simplest terms. a wonk is 
technically savvy but only that. Wonks struggle to build constituencies for their 
ideas. We use “wonkish” to convey a style of speech that is needlessly complex, 
even inaccessible.

In general, Students D and E also had important points but relied heavily 
on notes and rushed somewhat, making it harder for us to understand key 
points made by both. A reference to “it is not here,” for example, left us 
wondering, as we looked again at the slide, “what’s the ‘it’”? Student E’s 
points about reactions of the tenants were critical, but they seemed directed 
at the screen.  
 
Cherie Abbanat noted that transition remarks, to get you from speaker to 
speaker, were some of the team’s best, because they were “off script.” 
 
The closing message could have been simplified for greater impact, and you 
probably should have noted Commonwealth’s uncommon demographic 
make-up. That is, context matters. The supporting slide (Principles for future 
redevelopment) was too “busy,” offered too much text. A graphic integrating 
the physical and non-physical elements of your message here would have 
been super. 
 
Visual aids (slides) 
 
Too many of the visuals seemed weakly linked to the spoken points, also 
oddly timed, as though you needed more practice with the slides and some 
revision to get a clear and persuasive “storyboard” together—a logical, 
intuitive package to back up your remarks. 
 
On the other hand, individual slides were gems, e.g. Slide 8 (Physical design 
interventions), which combines a clear header with specific design advice and 
quotes by residents. Plus several that follow in that section. These would be 
enormously helpful to key briefees, or secondary audiences, not in 
attendance. These have a stand-alone quality. 
 
Score: 90
