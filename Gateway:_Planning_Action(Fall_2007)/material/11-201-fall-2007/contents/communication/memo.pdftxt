Effective Professional Writing: The Memo

The Context
(cid:134) The workplace or field:
(cid:132) Time is precious.
(cid:132) Information has substantive as well as political 
implications.
(cid:134) The decision-maker as reader:
(cid:132) Busy and distracted (attention “spread thin”), not 
necessarily patient while you get to the point.
(cid:132) Info needs are varied, unpredictable, fluid.
(cid:132) Sometimes offers fuzzy instructions.

Academic vs. professional writing
Differences (when writing concisely)
(cid:134) The academic reader often demands nuance and relevance to established 
lines of thinking, while the professional reader wants the “so what’s” for 
their decisionmaking emphasized (relevance to their actions).
(cid:134) An academic assignment assumes a small and benevolent audience, but 
professional documents can be “leaked,” end up in the hands of 
unintended readers.
Similarities
(cid:134) Strong essays and strong memos both start with your main ideas, but 
essays usually build toward conclusion and synthesis. The memo’s 
conclusions are usually right up top.
(cid:134) In both, persuasive argument = clear viewpoint + evidence
(cid:134) In both, addressing counter-arguments tends to strengthen your case.

Effective Professional Writing: The Memo

Top mistakes in memos
(cid:134) Content: off point or off task (major substantive 
omissions, given the request); impolitic (risks 
political costs if leaked); inappropriate assumptions 
as to background knowledge; no evidence.
(cid:134) Organization: important info “buried,” no summary 
up top, format confusing, not “skim-able.” Sentences 
long and dense, headings an after-thought.
(cid:134) Style: language too academic, too “preachy,” or too 
casual; sentences long and/or dense.

Why write memos?
(cid:134) Professional communication
(cid:132) Efficient
(cid:132) Persuasive
(cid:132) Focused
(cid:134) Two types of memos:
(cid:132) Informational (provide analytic background)
(cid:132) Decision or “action” (analyze issues and also 
recommend actions)

Revise for Clarity
(cid:134) Delete “empty” introductory sentences
(cid:132) Example:  Very important lessons can be learned 
from the Rebuild L.A. model.

(cid:134) Avoid argument via restatement
Example:  The primary weaknesses of the RLA were 
X,Y and Z.  X,Y, and Z, were problematic 
because they didn’t take into account community 
needs.  These needs made the RLA weak.
