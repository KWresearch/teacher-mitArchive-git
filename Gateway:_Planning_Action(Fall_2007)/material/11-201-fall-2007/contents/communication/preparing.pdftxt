Effective Professional Writing: 
Preparing for November 2nd and the Memo Assignment 
 
If planning is knowledge in action, communication is arguably the core 
currency. Our alumni frequently rank oral and written communication skills as 
among the most professionally valuable skills they learned in school—or wish 
they had worked harder to acquire early in their careers. 
 
Contrary to popular belief, these skills are often not acquired well on 
the job. Many organizations practice—and as such “teach”—substandard 
writing, for example: writing that is minimally adequate but not truly effective. 
Meanwhile, the strongest writers in the organization are often too busy to stop 
and lead workshops, let alone assign memo writing exercises and provide 
feedback. School is the place to master the fundamentals, gain practice, and 
make mistakes, i.e. where the risks and costs of mistakes for your career are 
trivial rather than in the world of work, where the costs can be significant. 
 
Our posted slides, guidelines, video, and the November 2nd in-section 
workshop all focus on the demands of professional writing generally and on 
the memo, as an invaluable form, specifically. You may review the 2-hour 
video before or after November 2nd section, as you wish, but allow about 60-
90 minutes to do the reading portion, explained below, in advance of section. 
 

What is a memo? 

 
Memos are relatively brief professional documents, generally written 
to decision-makers—whether public, private, or nongovernmental. 
“Brief” typically means 250 to 1500 words, but many effective memos are on 
the short end of that range. 
 
Effective memos are designed to help those decision-makers think more 
clearly and/or act rather than approach a topic more generally or offer mere 
opinion. You will prepare two kinds of memos in 11.201: a decision or “action” 
memo (focused on the material taught by Profs. Kim and Rajagopal); and an 
informational memo (for the Observation Exercise, your final assignment). 
 
On the course website, the materials include a slide show, brief items about 
memo writing, plus sample memos. Some of the "how to" content of this 
material may be familiar to you from work experience. If so, consider this a 
quick refresher to ensure that we all begin with similar assumptions about 
what's expected. If you have done little or no professional memo writing until 
now, give this material close attention.

How to prepare 

Read the material posted on the MIT Server, and come to your November 2nd 
discussion section prepared to discuss the following: 
 

1.  Using the criteria outlined in the guides to memo writing, rank the 
sample memos in terms of their overall effectiveness and readability. Try 
to focus on style and organization of argument rather than substance. 
Which one is the most effective and which the least? Why? 

2.  Pick one of the less effective policy memos, plus the sample student 
memo about a Gateway case, and outline some concrete improvements. 

3.  Preview your task: Even though we haven’t covered all of the case 
material at issue in your decision memo assignment, read the 
assignment instructions. They include a decisionmaker, a context, and a 
task. 

Beyond the easy-to-use slides, the reading material is in several parts: 
 
A. Guidelines on memo writing: 
•  Winston Churchill on brevity (World War II memo) 
•  Guidelines for writing informational memos 
•  Checklist for writing action (decision) memos 
•  More advice on organization: Bob Behn on how to direct the reader’s 
attention 

 
B. Sample policy memos, U.S. government: 
•  Neustadt to President-elect John F. Kennedy on reorganization powers 
(1960); 
•  Lynn to Secretary Morton on Central Utah water project (1973); 
•  President Carter to the Director of NSF on tropical forests (1979); 
•  Kleiman to White House domestic policy staff on the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) taking over the Drug Enforcement Agency (1993) 

C. Sample Gateway student memo (modified from actual submissions) 

•  To the Mayor of Boston, on what defines “success” in public housing 
redevelopment. 

Beyond the guidance here … 
 
On concise written English, Strunk and White’s The Elements of Style is an 
excellent addition to your professional bookshelf. It’s now available free on-
line in addition to the classic hardcopy book-form. The book’s central 
message:

Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary 
words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that 
a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no 
unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his/her 
sentences short, or that s/he avoid all detail … but that every word tell 
(emphasis added). 

 
By contrast, much ineffective writing in the professions is labeled 
“bureaucratese” or “plannerese”—writing laden with cumbersome ideas, 
sentence constructions, and jargon. Strive to avoid that.
