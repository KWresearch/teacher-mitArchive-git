Sample Feedback on Team Briefings 
 
Case: Anacostia Waterfront Initiative 
 
Team “X” 
 
Our evaluation covers your briefing, visual aids, and handout, though the 
feedback below may offer more on one of those than the other elements. 
 
Briefing (content and delivery) 
 
Your team excelled in several key dimensions: You made specific criticisms of 
the light rail decisionmaking process conducted to date (rather than offering 
generalities about the need to consult more); you had a strong visual package 
to illustrate the geography and visual interest inherent in this strategy area and 
to offer us a clear storyboard from start to finish (and you supplemented the 
main briefing with rich back-up data and a useful case comparison to Portland); 
and team members responded very directly to briefee questions. The latter 
helped you compensate for the limited attention, up front, to the threshold 
question of whether light rail is likely to be worth it. You also coordinated well as 
a team. 
 
As for individual speakers, Student-A’s overview was clear, and her brief 
statement of the project’s potential was helpful (in real life, you’d try to find out 
in advance where the key decisionmakers are most skeptical or are likely to 
need the most help: The idea of the light rail? Specifics on implementation? The 
lead agency’s role in a complex inter-agency plan? Something else?). 
 
Your up-front recommendations were clear, followed by a preview with a 
straightforward logic. Student-B’s outline of how principles of equitable 
development was clear and well timed: Other groups needed this but didn’t have 
it. Ditto the analysis of alternatives. Likewise, Student-C offered a specific 
critique, well supported by visuals, of the weak stakeholder engagement carried 
out so far. Note that the Board chair’s later question is still a key one: 
Government should do a better job of consulting, fine, but what exactly is our 
organization’s role vis-à-vis that problem? This is a concern born of years of 
pushing agencies to do better at what they are entrusted to do: You have to set 
priorities and understand your role, or you’ll get nowhere. But the key is that 
your briefing persuaded us to think that far: Your case that public involvement 
efforts to date have been inadequate was well made. The slide with two simple 
lists (consulted, insufficient consultation) was superb to “nail” this case. 
Student-D’s wrap-up was effective: detailed and persuasive. 
 
The more detailed recommendations were well summarized. We especially 
appreciated the attention to what the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation (AWC)

needs to learn and why one needs to build the capacity of resident stakeholders 
to participate in a complex, many-issue decisionmaking process over time. 
 
Responses to our questions were well informed. In a longer briefing, you would 
want to listen carefully to the concerns and extend your analysis to meet them. 
You did this on the overall value of light rail as a policy strategy, citing Portland 
and clear links to needs East of the River (though a deeper analysis would get 
into job projections, ridership, traffic and other disruption costs, etc.). On the 
participation front, you devoted considerable energy to a planning process that 
another agency had run and seemed surprised at Goldsmith’s query about 
AWC’s role. It isn’t clear, at this point, that there will be an AWC in a few 
years—a vigorous institution with influence, that is, not just a corporation on 
paper—and you didn’t really have the political data with which to assess the 
specifics of holding the transportation agency accountable. So it was fine to 
underscore how poorly run the agency’s process really was and, in terms of the 
AWC role, to re-connect the transportation strategy to AWC’s larger aim of 
engaging affected communities in revitalization decisions. 
 
Finally, your team managed time well, covering the additional information 
contained in the Portland example and the important connection to Federal 
transportation legislation. It was an excellent, informative briefing all around. 
 
Visual aids (slides) and handout 

You had many excellent slides. The data were well selected and clearly 
summarized. The visual storyboard was simple, logical, and persuasive, taking 
us from your recommendations to each component, unpacking it, returning to 
the core, using maps to re-place us in context. These were some of the best 
slides we saw all semester—on consultation, links to AWC’s mission (for coalition 
building strategy), physical planning alternatives, and more. A few reminders: 
Don’t ever lead with abbreviations (LRT, CBO) in early slides. Spell things out in 
almost all cases. If “community” means “community residents,” say that, or 
“community organizations and residents” if you mean both (or whatever else 
you mean). The handout is well organized and clearly written; it conveys key 
technical insights as well as the crucial institutional aspects—why, if AWC wants 
this strategy area to succeed, it must strengthen participation and make it 
meaningful. 
 
Your score and grade 
 
In scoring each group, we weighed substantive argumentation first and 
foremost, considering delivery only to the extent that it related directly to your 
effectiveness as argument makers (or persuaders). Above, we comment on style 
but didn’t score it. We considered visuals as an additional element, weighing 
content more heavily than use. Score: 97, Grade: A
