Team Briefing Assignment
Fall 2007

Overview
• This file includes sample slides from each part of a 
briefing (title slide, summary/overview, body of the 
briefing, summary/next steps). I’ve added text boxes with 
brief comments.
• Please review this material on-screen only and/or 
print via your home system, not the CRN.
• And remember, the visuals, text, numbers (if 
appropriate) should work together as part of an 
integrated story, told in a clear sequence, for the busy, 
easily distracted decisionmaker(s) you’re briefing. Visual 
elements are not merely “aids,” and text is often key to 
delivering the story of the visuals. See comments …

Title slides

• Should have an engaging image or color 
background but not be distracting (too 
cute, alarming, etc.) or off topic.
• Should include the basics: A name for the 
briefing (ideally, one that captures the core 
puzzle or focus), the date, the 
audience/sponsor name, and the 
presenters’ names. 

Briefing title was here
Presented by: 
Student 1
Student 2
Student 3
Etc …

This image is clean, takes us to 
a focal site, and conveys most 
of the essentials without making 
the eye work too hard. Should 
always include the briefing date, 
though, and usually the sponsor 
name (audience) or setting, too.

Briefing title was here

Student names

This variation de-emphasizes the image details 
but still strongly signals “place,” plus delivers the 
basics in a readily understood format: Title 
stands out in its own panel of color, the rest is 
super-imposed, etc.

Summary slides

• Briefings should generally begin with a thank you, an 
intro of your team members, minimal background and 
then your major points, so a summary slide of your major 
points often appears at the start and finish (as a 
“bookend”). As background, indicate what you were 
analyzing (very briefly, as a reminder of your scope) and 
not just what you concluded about it.
• Label it as you choose: Summary, Our Conclusions, 
Scope and Key Findings, etc.
• This slide may double as a preview slide if it clearly 
signals the structure of your briefing, else add a second, 
distinct Preview slide.

Summary of action points This immediately signals the listener that 
you’ve distilled what they should DO (“action 
points”), all in one place. It does not, on its 
own, signal the scope or any background, 
though, which is fine as long as you 
compensate elsewhere
Recommendation #1 in a simple, declarative sentence 
(went here).

Recommendation #2 in a simple, declarative sentence 
(went here).

Recommendation #3 in a simple, declarative sentence 
(went here).

[and the three were logically sequenced: 1 should come 
before 2, which set the stage for 3, etc.]

A Development Agenda

Strengthen access 
to the site

Build legitimate 
stakeholder 
organization

The team’s notion of the end 
goal (what it all adds up to) 
was here

Foster Self 
Financing 
Opportunities

Create Definitive 
Development Plan

Create an 
Identifiable 
Destination

This is a classic summary slide on the hub-
and-spoke model (the small circles are the 
spokes). It shows how actionable ideas add up 
to an end goal. It doesn’t signal sequence, 
though, which is sometimes crucial but not 
always simple to recommend (“do X before 
Y”). The team envisioned a set of mutually 
reinforcing, concurrent steps.

Our Scope
(cid:57) Evaluate XYZ …
(cid:57) Identify Key Assumptions 
(cid:57) Challenge Weak Assumptions
(cid:57) Issue Further Recommendations

The layout is simple and effective, and the team used 
this well up front to say, in effect, “this is what we 
covered … check, check … and this is what you’ll 
hear …” In this instance, one would want to be sure to 
match the scope elements precisely (even if we must 
summarize). Don’t headline “scope” but invent—in the 
form of something we can’t quite recognize—your own 
twist on the scope! Also, the word “further” is 
extraneous here and should be dropped. Make every 
word count, and use no more than you must.

Upfront Recommendation
The XYZ [current] plan should move 
forward, but with the following 
considerations:

The Plan Must Be Improved Through:
(cid:57)Main idea #1 here
This one is well-conceived: Headline a 
“bottom-line” general recommendation about 
an existing plan (dump it? use parts? Etc.) and 
(cid:57)Main ideas #2 here
then the team’s main ideas for how to improve 
on it. The word “Upfront” should be dropped, 
(cid:57)Main idea #3 here
though. It’s the way the team thought about 
this (“placing it upfront”), not the way the 
briefee would (we expect your main ideas 
upfront). Also, “considerations” is an over-
used, imprecise word. One could instead say 
“Move forward with the XYZ [Plan Name] but 
improve it in three key dimensions:

Body slides

• These are the slides between the “frontmatter” (title, summary, 
perhaps preview) and whatever you use to finish (summary, next 
steps, etc.). These slides represent your core material (any 
additional background plus mainly analysis of the issues).
• These should follow good slide etiquette: thoughtfully chosen 
layouts and colors, avoid distractions, try to balance words (not too 
many, ever, just a few points per slide) and images and 
numbers/charts. Avoid excess “decoration,” but do use visuals to 
help tell your story.
• And the most important rule of all: Each slide should have a 
message, which should be intelligible without your voice-over. That 
is, the slide should function as a stand-alone point in your larger 
sequence (the slide handout might be passed on to key players who 
couldn’t attend the briefing, and even your listeners need clear 
messages consistently). 

Evaluation of the current plan

It just works: The title 
is lifted straight from 
the scope (“evaluate 
the current plan …) 
and the two lists form 
a logical pair and are 
concise in their 
contents. One could 
further streamline it 
visually: The words 
“Strengths” and 
“Weaknesses” don’t 
need bullet markers 
(the squares). The 
underline is enough.

(cid:134) Strengths
(cid:132) Addresses XYZ well.
(cid:132) Engaged 
stakeholders and 
secured public 
support
(cid:132) Celebrates rich 
history of the area
(cid:132) Element Z engages 
diverse interests

(cid:134) Weaknesses
(cid:132) Small, scattered 
element Y’s fail to 
create signature 
attraction for the area
(cid:132) Relies on actors with 
limited capacity
(cid:132) Overdevelops 
subarea Y

Access Needs

This sharp slide 
has a simple, 
access-focused 
message. Colors 
are clear, simple, 
superimposed on 
a recognizable 
image. Just a 
little text (caption) 
would make it 
perfect, so 
there’s no doubt 
what the 
message is.

This could be a bit better formatted, but it reflects an 
intuitive, readily grasped logic: “Things we should keep”
vs. “things we can enhance” (or drop, as the case might 
be). It might be possible to use an annotated image to 
make the same points, but there’s probably too much 
text for that (the slide would be too “busy”). Note the 
very large header in the upper right: Need to simplify 
and perhaps shrink that a bit.

This is much too much to squeeze on 
one slide: The shapes are complex, 
the lines don’t follow an intuitive logic, 
the dangling green thing is distracting 
and its content of less importance than 
the blue. This needs another wave or 
two of revision to crisply convey the 
core proposal and simplify, simplify.

This is a well-conceived and executed slide. It uses 
color, shapes, and boundaries (e.g., the dotted 
lines) effectively to make a centerpiece concept of 
the team’s briefing accessible and engaging. The 
next slide is similar: We don’t need to read every 
word to get the message and impact.

Barriers to entering the neighborhood are physical and psychological. Removing 
the image of isolation is the first step to developing a new sense of ownership.

The listener-viewer 
probably won’t even 
read the sentence up 
top, but this slide 
uses images to 
quickly make an 
important point about 
the barriers to 
access. It’s 
straightforward and

Historical Context

[“Pre-history”
summarized] 
Milestone #2

Nice layout and logic: Most briefees know 
instinctively that history matters (shapes the 
present) and also that it can be a source of 
lessons. But defining them is another matter. 
This team picked out milestones and framed 
them carefully to lead to a specific lesson 
(about “quick fixes”), which was aligned with 
the team’s recommendations.
Milestone #4 (agency gains control of site)

Milestone #3

Milestone #5 (plan completed, stalled progress)

“Quick fixes” have not 
worked in the past

Economic Viability
Assumption 1:
Funds for capital improvements come from
philanthropy, non-governmental organization 
membership, corporate sponsorship, 
and …[more content was here]
Critique
These monies are uncertain, or non-existent.

This is a bit wordy and 
vertically “long”—the two 
critiques should perhaps be 
split into two slides—but 
the structure is clear: The 
current plan has key 
assumptions, and here’s 
our assessment of them. 
The next slide bases the 
team’s recommendations 
on the assessment. It’s a 1-
2-3 logical argument, easy 
to follow. Note that two 
related but distinct ideas 
are critiqued here: Project 
financing viability versus 
true “economic” viability in 
light of market demand for 
what the current plan would 
place at the target site.

Assumption 2:
This plan is the most economically viable option.
Critique
The plan does not consider the city’s current economy 
or leading trends.

Economic Viability
Recommendations:
(cid:57) Explore …
(cid:57) Explore …
(cid:57) Consider financing through …
(cid:57) Establish …

The layout is simple and effective. It’s great that the team began each 
declarative sentence with an “action verb.” As it happens, though, the fourth 
idea didn’t quite fit with the other three: It was an end goal based on a 
principle, which the other three ideas MIGHT fulfill. These distinctions 
matter for decisionmakers, and the structure of a briefing and a slide should 
reflect such distinctions as clearly and simply as possible. A visual 
argument here (3 ideas supporting or pointing to a 4th) may have been 
better.

How the [current] plan meets critical 
values for the [area/site]
(cid:122) Visual and physical access to the water
(cid:123)Element A of the current plan
(cid:122) A diversity of uses: arts and recreation
(cid:123)Element B
(cid:122) Interpretation and education of the [area’s] 
history
This slide has strengths in the logic of 
construction: It headlines how a plan 
(cid:123)Element C
addresses key values, and then each 
value is paired with a single key element 
of the plan. But it’s crying out for a more 
(cid:122) Equitable economic activity
visual representation, and the text is much 
bigger than it needs to be. It reads like a 
(cid:123)Element D
flash card for the team more than a 
readily digestible, high-impact message 
for the briefees.

coming together) removed due to 
copyright restrictions.

A nice marker, this slide does not 
offer analysis but rather marks a 
shift to a new component of the 
analysis, plus the subparts—all in 
concise, clear language, with an 
icon (intuitive image).

Implementation

Create an entity that:
• Specific function #1
• Specific function #2
• Specific function #3
• Specific function #4
• Specific function #5

This slide was among the more specific 
and discussable implementation slides—
very engaging for the briefees. It worked 
out, from the briefee’s perspective, what 
key functions mattered (what a lead 
implementation agency should be 
responsible for) and boiled them down to 5 
key points. This signaled that the team 
didn’t take effective implementation, which 
was a main part of the scope, for granted 
or treat it as an after-thought vis-à-vis 
critiquing the plan itself. Word construction 
was sharp, too: The lead line supplies the 
broad action (“create an entity”), there’s 
the link (“that”) and then each function 
bullet began with an action verb 
(coordinates, liaises with, etc).

Community Process
In the past….
• Problematic condition #1, 
words, words, words

• …. #2, words, words, 
words words, words, 
words words, words, 
words words, words, 
words

Good logic: identify 
weaknesses in past 
approach and outline a 
different future. But the 
content belongs on two 
slides. It’s over-load for 
the briefee, and that 
undermines the impact 
of the important content. 
The future” list could be 
sharper, too: There’s an 
implicit logic, not quite 
spelled or worked out: 1 
is an overall 
commitment, 4 about 
who is chosen for a 
role. 2 and 3 might 
follow from both 1 and 
4. Or 4 is the first key, 
then 2 is overall 
approach, then 3 is a 
concrete means of 
working, and 2 is a 
practice and effect to 
lead toward an end 
state (“shared 
knowledge”). Would be 
even stronger if that 
shared knowledge led to 
a 5, spelled out: “Smart 
redevelopment backed 
by a real public 
mandate.” Most 
processes don’t want to 
stop at building 
Public Process, Connectivity, Environmental Sustainability, Economic Viability
knowledge.

• … #3, words, words, 
words words, words
In the future….
1. Collaborative participation with diverse stakeholders
2. Authentic listening and mutually shared knowledge
3. Accessible meetings and information
4. Credible developers willing to engage public selected
by agency.

Wrapping up (no samples here)

• You can use your summary/findings slide again. Or you 
could adapt its structure to show consistency but add 
some detail appropriate to your summation.
• You might also wish to emphasize Next Steps (often with 
an additional slide), depending on the thrust of your 
message.
• Appendix slides could follow, but don’t advance the show 
to them: “Freeze” on your final slide, which should 
capture your main points or great next-step ideas, and 
then invite questions (or additional ones, if you’ve 
already handled some).
