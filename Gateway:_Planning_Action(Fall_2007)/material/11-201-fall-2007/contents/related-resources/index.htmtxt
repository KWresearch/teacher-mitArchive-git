"Technology_of_Participation"_Facilitator_Training
This is by the Institute for Cultural Affairs and is relatively U.S.-focused
but highly developed.
Interaction_Institute_â_Facilitator_Training
A number of DUSP students and graduates have taken this training. The
Interaction Institute for Social Change is a spin-off of the for-profit
Interaction Associates.
Cultural_Competence_â_Concept,_Application
This is one portal site focused on the concept (and there's a Wikipedia entry
on cultural competence, by the way). Much of the application of this concept
has happened in health care and human services, though there are guides, case
studies, and skill building resources available for more and more fields.
Free_Online_Workshops_for_Planners_â_Professional_Development_Institute_(PDF)
This is run by a colleague in planning at Rutgers. His Institute offers
"Webinars" (Web-based seminars) and more, and these include, but go well
beyond, cultural competence, planners' roles, and so on.
