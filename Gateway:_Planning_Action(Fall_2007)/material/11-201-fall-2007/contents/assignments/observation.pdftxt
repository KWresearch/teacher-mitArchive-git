“You can see a lot by looking”: 
Planning observation exercise 

 
 
Overview. Yogi Berra was a great American philosopher. Ok, his day job was 
baseball coach. But he is also known for many profound insights on life, often 
crisply delivered in one-liners such as “The past ain’t what it used to be.” 
Another favorite of his was “You can see an awful lot by looking,” which we take 
to mean that one can perceive and learn a great deal by observing something 
closely, not casually. This final exercise in Gateway is all about observing 
carefully and generating lessons for action from that observation. 
 
You will attend a public planning event in greater Boston, carefully record 
fieldnotes on the event, and report on the event in a brief, well-organized 
informational memorandum. The assignment has two primary objectives: 
 

1.  To sharpen your powers of observation, specifically of planning events 
that feature a variety of interests, types of knowledge, styles of 
communication, and implications for action; and 

2.  To extend your capacity to make connections between important 
insights in planning theory and real-world events—in this case, events 
that are not “pre-digested” for you in readings or classroom discussion 
but uncovered by you through firsthand fieldwork on your own case 
(event). 

A secondary objective of the assignment is to further develop your skills at 
professional writing for busy decision-makers. 

The context. As part of a cross-national effort, the American Planning 
Association (APA) has launched a special task force to develop an up-to-date, 
critical report on how “public participation” in planning happens in the U.S., and 
you’ve joined an effort to observe and report on planning events in the Boston 
area specifically. The APA has decided to call it the “Participation in Practice” 
task force, to emphasize real patterns rather than idealized ones. 

In many countries, activists, academics, planning consultants, and government 
reformers hope to make planning by government, nongovernmental 
organizations, and others less technocratic and less driven by insular 
organizational concerns. Encouraging broad stakeholder participation will be part 
of this, but participation can mean many different things, and particular tactics 
for engaging citizens, businesses, associations, or others in decisionmaking do 
not always deliver as promised.

Given your knowledge of planning’s evolution and the key political dilemmas 
associated with participatory planning in particular, you have been recruited to a 
field research team that will attend public planning meetings and report back. 
See details below. 

The task. You will select and attend an event, typically for a few hours, record 
your observations in fieldnotes, collect any materials that may be available to 
meeting participants (reports, flyers, proposals or plans, other), analyze your 
notes and these other forms of data (if any), and produce an info memo for the 
Task Force Chair. You will then submit your memo (detailed below) and your 
fieldnotes (handwritten is fine) for our review, though we will only grade the 
memo portion. 

The background resource. See the reading for Session 24: Innes and Booher, 
“Reframing Public Participation: Strategies for the 21st Century” (2004). 

What kind of event? The meeting you attend should engage professional and 
non-professional planners—not just citizen activists, say. But it need not be a 
government-sponsored meeting. Many nonprofits do planning and employ a 
variety of trained “planners,” in the broad sense of the term. In general, these 
are the appropriate types of meetings: 

•  Public meetings announced by a government planning or redevelopment 
agency or by a more specialized agency, such as a transportation board or 
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO); 

•  Meetings of a planning commission, zoning board, landmarks commission, or 
other official planning body; 

•  Other public meetings, convened by government, on a policy decision or 
project, in a topic area that interests you; 

•  A planning or visioning session convened by a public or nonprofit 
organization, for example to create a neighborhood or regional plan or 
discuss an important project; 

•  Another kind of meeting, with permission. Please contact Prof. Briggs with 
subject line “Alternative planning meeting?” 

Meetings that do not work well: 

•  Routine business meetings for government bodies, such as the Boston or 
Cambridge city council. These are generally not designed or run to function 
as planning meetings. 

How should I enter? Depending on the purpose and scale of the event, you 
may wish to introduce yourself to the sponsors or facilitators and explain your 
presence and aims very transparently (“I’m a planning student at MIT, and I’m 
very interested in the issues here. My hope is to learn more about how 

Page 2 of 5 

participatory planning gets done …”). If you’re a resident or otherwise a 
constituent of the event, adjust as you see fit (“I’m a resident of _______ and 
also a planning student, so I’m here to …”). It may be helpful to introduce 
yourself and chat informally with meeting participants, before or after the event, 
to get their views. But this is not required. 

You are collecting data that may include exchanges about controversial issues. 
At truly public events, this is not an issue, since the event itself is in the public 
domain (comments are understood to be “on the record”). But if you attend 
another kind of meeting, or if you decide to chat with some meeting participants 
beyond the public portion of the event, and if you are asked how your notes will 
be used, you should be prepared to make a clear commitment: “My observations 
are only for my own use and for review as part of a planning course at MIT.” 

What do I watch for, and what should my report address? The APA Task 
Force wants to get a rich sense of the range of objectives that public planning 
events have, how they are structured to fulfill or not fulfill those objectives, and 
what actually happens at the events. Toward this end, you want to make 
detailed observations and capture them in fieldnotes. 

Here is a guide to addressing the Task Force’s specific questions in the form of a 
memo of no more than 1,250 words, starting with the usual summary on 
top, which conveys the main ideas in the sections below it. This is a suggested 
structure only, meant to give you room to convey your perspective and the 
unique features of the event you choose. As an informational memo, your report 
will not include recommendations for action by the recipient (Task Force 
Chairperson), but as part of your analysis, you will offer recommendations on 
how the event could have been structured or managed more effectively. 

The suggested word lengths are guides only, and not every event will lend itself 
to answering all questions below: 

Summary (about 100-125 words): “This memo reports on … I 
attended a meeting [or workshop or other type of event?] aimed at 
[indicate purpose], sponsored by [who?] … The structure of the meeting 
was [analysis in brief] … The content of the meeting featured 
[communication analysis in brief]. My assessment is that [implications 
and recommendations here].” Make every word count. This is a guide to 
what the Task Force wants to learn, right up top. As with a briefing, don’t 
merely indicate the sequence of parts to come, say something: convey 
your main ideas in brief. 

Event basics (about 100 words). Where was the event held and when? 
About how many people attended, in what roles (policymaker, staff, 
resident, other)? What was the setting like: configuration of the space, 
conduciveness to discussion or other exchange, décor or other visual 
stimuli, any other interesting (to you) environmental cues?

Structured participation (about 200-300 words). How was the event 
structured: How did it begin and end? How was the purpose presented? 
Who was able to speak and when? Were there formal rules of procedure 
or informal norms that you observed? Were information technologies, 
visual aids, or other media employed somehow to exchange information? 

Communication analyzed (about 500-700 words). What was the 
tone of speech: formal or informal, enthused or dispassionate, adversarial 
or cooperative, all of these at distinct moments? Did the process revolve 
around presentation of ideas and taking questions, joint problem-solving, 
something else? Were different cultural “codes” or styles in play? Was 
there useful info in nonverbal as well verbal communication, for example 
in body language or facial expressions or gestures? To the extent you are 
able to distinguish different types of participants, how did professionals or 
other trained experts approach the issues, and how about the non-
professionals? What features of the structure (as outlined in the section 
above) seemed consequential for the process? 

Implications and recommendations (about 150-200 words). First, 
from your perspective, how well were the event’s objectives fulfilled, and 
what changes might have made the event more effective? And second, 
indicate whether your findings corroborate, challenge, or complement the 
arguments in the background Innes and Booher reading—and how. 

Viewing samples. Several effective student memos are online, as part of this 
assignment [not available on the MIT OpenCourseWare site]. These are strong 
guides to what a finished memo should look like, with two important caveats: 
The samples responded to a longer memo assignment (up to 2000 words), and 
the final section of the memo connected student observations to any reading in 
the course, not specifically to the Innes and Booher article. 

How do I format the submission? You will submit an informational memo 
plus your fieldnotes, as follows: 

•  Address the memo … 
 
TO: Chairperson, APA Task Force on Participation in Practice 
THROUGH: Field Team Leader, Greater Boston Region 
FROM: [Your name] 
RE: Planning Observation, 11.201 Fall 2007 

•  Your memo should be no more than 1250 words, double spaced. As 
usual, no tiny print, please: Use an easy-to-read 12-point typeface and 
ample margins (at least one inch on all sides). Don’t forget to number your 
pages, spell check, and add the word count at the end of your memo. As with 
any professional memo, use clear formatting—logical subheadings, bullets, 
and so on—as appropriate, to make the memo rich but skim-able for the 
busy reader.

•  Submit your fieldnotes. Typed is fine but not required. If you do not type 
up your fieldnotes, scan your handwritten notes into a PDF document. Don’t 
forget to put your name and “11.201 Planning Observation Exercise (Fall 
2007)” on top of the fieldnote document.
