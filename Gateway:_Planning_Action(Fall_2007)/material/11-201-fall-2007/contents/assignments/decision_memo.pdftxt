Planning and Implementing Sustainable Infrastructure Projects

DECISION MEMO ASSIGNMENT 

 
For this assignment, you will draft a memo, receive feedback (see last page of this 
document), and then revise and submit your final memo. 
 
 
The context: The President of the World Bank has appointed you to serve on the 
World Energy Council, which is a high-level body tasked with making 
recommendations about securing a future where energy needs are met in a socially 
and environmentally sustainable manner. As a major project funder, the Bank can 
play a central role in this—or do a great deal more damage. 
 
The problem: Energy projects in the world are increasingly beset by political risks 
and public opposition, such as that seen in the Narmada case and many others 
where developing major infrastructure frequent involves land “takings” and costly 
displacement as well as environmental impacts. As a major funder and regulator of 
energy projects and other infrastructure development, the World Bank wants to 
play a lead role in designing better, more legitimate projects.  Toward this end, you 
are to identify lessons of the Narmada project and of recent takings controversies 
for the Bank’s future policies and projects. 
 
The task. You have been invited to prepare a decision memo, of no more than 
1,000 words, explaining (a) to what degree the Narmada case is an illustration of 
effective and fair planning; (b) in general, what criteria the Bank can use to judge 
successes and failures (or shortcomings) in big infrastructure projects; and (c) in 
brief, what key actions by the Bank might prevent or mitigate the failures and 
promote success as much as possible. 
 
Yes, this is a good deal to cover in 1,000 words or less, but this kind of scope is not 
uncommon for a professional memorandum, and the well-organized memo can 
have a big impact in spite of its short form vis-à-vis the big, complex issues—in 
part because it will be more widely read than long reports or academic treatments 
of the issues, especially by the key decisionmakers. 
 
Based in part on your memo, the Bank intends to make a public statement about 
what successful large infrastructure projects should include and how the Bank’s 
policies and programs will promote that ideal. 
 
Soon after you are invited to prepare your memo, you find yourself in discussion 
with the Bank President’s senior staff, one of whom says to you by phone: 
We know that displacing people from their land was a central issue in 
Narmada and that “takings” have become increasingly controversial in many 
corners of the globe. If you can draw on your knowledge of those 
controversies and the ethical dilemmas involved, that will be very helpful.

You won’t have room, in the memo, to detail those other cases, of course. 
And you’ll need to remind the President of the most salient features of the 
Narmada project and its context—whatever is essential to make your 
analysis clear … Also, the President is aware of the criticisms of the Bank’s 
role, but be sure your memo is aimed at us: Like it or not, we’re lenders, 
primarily, and we have leverage over outcomes as financiers, not as 
governments. The Narmada case showed us how extensive that leverage is 
in some ways and how limited in others. Also, it’s not as though we’re going 
to abandon big projects altogether. That’s a non-starter. The question is: 
How to make them as fair and effective as possible? 

 
Format. Double-space your memo, and use ample margins (at least an inch on all 
sides). As always, no micro-print, please: Assume a busy reader, and stick with a 
12-point typeface. Use your word processing software to count the number of 
words in your memo, and place that number below the text, i.e. on the last page 
(e.g. “Word count = 997”). 
 
As with any professional workproduct, spell check and proofread your work carefully 
before submitting, be concise and clear, avoid needless jargon or dense academic 
arguments, and provide an effective summary up front—i.e., your main messages, 
not just a preview of topics you will cover. Remember that we don’t need a 
conclusion at the end (it should be at the beginning, in the summary, supported by 
the body of the memo). Don’t formally cite sources unless you use a direct quote, 
in which case make it brief, and simply footnote the source. Do not use footnotes, 
endnotes or other “extras” to make additional substantive points. Present all of 
your ideas in the memo itself. 
 
Also, be sure to briefly define any specialized terms, if any, that you find it 
absolutely necessary to use, such as “project-affected persons.” For a professional 
memo, unlike an academic exam, you can’t assume that the reader has read what 
you have or knows the specialized terminology. 
 
Address the memo: 
 

9 November 2007 
TO:  President, The World Bank 
[Your name here], World Energy Council 
FR: 
RE:  Planning and implementing sustainable infrastructure 
(11.201 Gateway Decision Memo) 

 
You may not ask a fellow planning student to proofread your document, but it’s OK 
to ask a writing tutor, or a friend or roommate, who is not in planning to do so. 
Direct any questions to Prof. Briggs. See next page, and good luck.

Here’s a preview of the kind of feedback we give on the DRAFT (it’s therefore a 
guide to the most common pitfalls in drafting a memo of this kind and a guide for 
self-assessment if you so choose): 

 
 
DECISION MEMO: FEEDBACK ON DRAFT 

 
Below, we assess your draft memo and summarize the changes needed. All of the 
memos would be much stronger if revised. 
 
 
FEEDBACK 
 
CONTENT 

_______  Summary: incomplete,  wordy,  vague or unclear,  slow to get to the 
main ideas,  doesn’t summarize your main ideas, Other: _____________ 

_______ 

 
_______ 

Body: Incomplete (major omissions), given the task, specifically: 
___________________________________________________________ 
Priorities off, given task:  too much case narrative relative to 
recommended criteria and actions 

_______  Language inappropriate for a professional memorandum (circle): too 
academic,  too casual,   too preachy,  too jargon-laden,  other 

_______  Analysis lacks clarity or persuasiveness (circle): diagnosis and 
prescriptions are loosely coupled, evidence lacking or inaccurate,  
counter-arguments or feasibility not considered,   timid about major 
problems in the case 

_______ 

Impolitic: Risks political costs if the memo is leaked 

ORGANIZATION 

_______  Structure does not suit a decision memo (circle): subheadings vague or 
missing,  main ideas come late,  other: ___________________________
