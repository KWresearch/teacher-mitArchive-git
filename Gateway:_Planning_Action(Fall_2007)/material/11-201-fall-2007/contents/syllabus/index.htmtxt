***** Overview *****
This course introduces incoming students in the Master in City Planning (MCP)
program to the theory and history of planning in the public interest. It relies
primarily on challenging real-world cases to highlight persistent dilemmas: the
power and limits of planning, the multiple roles in which planners find
themselves in communities around the globe, and the political, ethical, and
practical dilemmas that planners face as they try to be effective. As such, the
course provides an introduction to the major ideas and debates that define what
the field labels "planning theory," as well as a (necessarily) condensed global
history of modern planning. 11.201 builds directly on the "How we approach
planning" summer module that incoming students completed online.
Courses in planning history, politics, and ethicsâoften several of themâare
required in all accredited graduate programs in planning in the U.S. It's a
condition of accreditation. Gateway: Planning Action combines those contents,
with a stronger focus on real-world cases than more conventional lecture-based
planning theory and history courses at other schools. It also adds several
opportunities to strengthen hands-on professional competencies, especially in
communication.
***** What is "Planning"? *****
Our focus is on planning action or "planned change," i.e. intervening in the
world to change it, not the history of urban development or urban social
theory, though we will explore the ways in which planning ideals and cities
have shaped each other as societies evolve.
***** Planning Where? And Theory Why? *****
The course is not an introduction to urban form or the city planning profession
in the U.S. specifically, though our work includes U.S. cases and readings,
particularly on the front end of the course. The most important of these are
planning classics that are widely taught and referenced throughout the
profession, inside and outside the U.S.
But don't look for vocational insights on particular planning practices, such
as urban design or transport policy analysis or anti-poverty initiatives in
cities. Planning theory is just that: a body of broader ideas about the modern
history of intervening in the world wisely and fairly in order to change it.
The primary objectives of the course are:
   1. To introduce students to the field of planning, broadly definedâits
      modern history, promise, and challengesâproviding, in the process, a
      language and set of reference points that help define the (narrower)
      profession of city planning and the many fields it touches;
   2. To begin to make 65+ individuals with varied backgrounds, goals, and
      expectations an effective learning community grounded in mutual respect,
      informed inquiry, and more; and
   3. To strengthen core competencies essential to effective practice,
      including problem analysis, effective teamwork, and communication skills
      (written and oral).
And additional objectives of the course are:
   1. To help students begin to develop a workable theory of practice to guide
      their professional development and lifelong learning;
   2. To stimulate a critical awareness of the opportunities and challenges
      specific to planning in increasingly diverse societies, whether diversity
      is defined in racial, ethnic, religious, class, or other dimensions;
   3. To introduce incoming students to the Department, including distinct
      specializations and the domestic and international elements of our work
      (and bridges across them).
In pursuit of these objectives, we'll visit and revisit fundamental questions:
Where did planning come from, and where is it going? What are its core values
and ethical commitments? What range of things do planners do and in what roles?
Is there an identifiable public interest, and if so, how can planning promote
it as cities and societies changeâoften in profound and confusing ways?
***** Format and Requirements *****
The course format and requirements emphasize the development of practice
competencies and professionalismâbut in the context of applying big ideas and
questions. Like much planning practice, much class time will be interactive,
calling on you to be an active learner.
Our work on real-world cases will be necessarily selective: That is, our work
cannot be "mile-wide and inch-deep." So our cases will center on focal themes.
The written assignments (see below) emphasize fluency with ideas in some
instances and also professional judgment in some instances. The not-quite-
weekly Friday discussion sections give you a structured "small learning
community" to complement lecture, discussions, and more in the large-class
setting, where the entire MCP class has a chance to discuss issues with far-
reaching implications for planning and for each of your careers.
***** Structure *****
The course is in four (4) units or parts. The first brief part (two sessions)
introduces the course and core dilemmas of planning action, including major
stages of modern planning's history. The second unit revolves around a focal
case and team-based oral briefing assignment. The third unit explores the major
developments and debates in modern planning history and theory and culminates
in a midterm exam. The fourth unit examines political, ethical and practical
dilemmas of planning in a world of social diversity and inequality. It includes
two memo assignments that serve as capstones for the course, plus a course
review and discussion of your planning education and career development.
***** Assignments *****
There is: (1) a non-graded, 500-word writing diagnostic; (2) a team-based oral
briefing, of about 30 minutes, focused on a looming policy or practice decision
in a simulated context; (3) a midterm exam of three take-home essay questions
(you will have about a week to complete it); (4) a decision memorandum of about
4 pages drawing on two case modules taught by Profs. Rajagopal and Kim; and (5)
an informational memorandum of about 4-6 pages drawing on your firsthand
observation and analysis of a planning meeting somewhere in Greater Boston
(review this assignment early, after Ses #1, so you don't get stuck with few/
poor meeting options late in the semester).
**** Group Work ****
Getting work done with and through other people is central to effective
practice. In the words of one expert on public service careers, as well as
experts in leadership and what has come to be called "personal effectiveness,"
group workâbroadly definedâis one of the three essentials of working in the
public interest:
    * "Hunger": A passion for public service, a "fire in the belly," the desire
      to make a difference in the world;
    * "Speed": Analytic sharpness, the ability to think your way through hard
      problems, and to make new mistakes (not the same old ones), each and
      every day; and
    * "Weight": Knowing how to function on a team or inside an institution,
      knowing when to assert and when to "salute" (defer), asserting your own
      authority (including your expertise) productively while working
      productively with the authority of others.
As such, you will work in a variety of group settings: (a) the main class
sessions, some of which will include small-group discussion tasks; (b)
discussion sections assigned at the start of the semester, which will meet
regularly to discuss readings and assignments; (c) teams that work on the
briefing assignment early in the semester; and (d) ad hoc groups that may meet
to cover important concepts.
***** Evaluation and Feedback *****
We emphasize the latter as much as possible: giving you feedback on your work
so as to sharpen your thinking and writing skills. Not everyone welcomes
feedback, wherein we identify strengths as well as areas for improvement. The
course also includes evaluation (numerical scoring and letter grading). The
instructors (teaching assistants) do much, but not all, of the grading and
feedback, with guidance from Prof. Briggs and frequent teaching team
discussions to enhance consistency, strive for a constructively critical tone
(which includes candid assessment of shortcomings), and ensure detail in
evaluation.
Your grade will be based on:
                           Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                                                   PERCENTAGES
Take-home midterm exam                                       30%
Two professional memoranda                                   40%
The oral briefing                                            20%
Effective class participation, including discussion sections 10%

Â 
We have scheduled the graded assignmentsâas best we can, within
constraintsânot to conflict with other assignments in the first-year core
curriculum (notably, in economics).
In addition, you will complete a non-graded written assignment: a brief writing
diagnostic at the start of the semester, in the form of a 1-page essay, which
will allow Prof. Abbanat and the 11.201 teaching team to assess and develop
your skills in outlining evidence and making arguments in writing. This builds
directly on the "Reading critically" and "Writing effectively" summer modules
you did online.
**** Late Submissions ****
We routinely grant extensions for genuine emergencies (contact Prof. Briggs by
phone and email), but in fairness to your colleagues, unexcused late
submissions (exams or other assignments) will be penalized, with points
deducted according to how late you submit. Details are on each assignment.
***** Professional Communication *****
The main course assignments, along with special skill-building instruction and
resource materials, are designed to make you a more competent communicator in a
variety of planning contexts. Our work together will include required workshops
on professional speech and writing, with a focus on informing and persuading
decision makers, constituents, or clients.
**** Improving Your Writing ****
The teaching team will encourage some students to work intensively on writing
skills through the linked course in planning communication (11.225), taught by
Prof. Abbanat. But that course is open to all. She is also available,
throughout the semester, as a writing coach, and so are staff at the MIT
Writing and Communication Center (see its Web site). Be sure to contact them
with adequate notice, i.e. well in advance of assignment due dates.
***** The Classroom: Main Class Meetings *****
A premise of the course is that our own efforts to engage challenging topics
will reflect the very real-world challenges we wish to understand. The
classroom is thus a case in point, and while faculty bear a special
responsibility given their role in guiding the work, every class member is
responsible for contributing to our success. Much of our time will be spent in
the "group of the whole" (entire class) but sometimes, we will use small
groups, as few as 2-3 members apiece, to give you a chance for very
interpersonal exchange and comparing ideas with classmates.
Whatever the format and scale, our discussions should therefore reflect a
commitment to the very working principlesâor ground rules and normsâon
which effective action in a democracy depends, especially in diverse societies,
for example:
    * Respect with challenge: Promoting mutual respect, being as inclusive as
      possible, but being willing to disagree thoughtfully where it will
      support a better discussion or bring important ideas and differences into
      view;
    * Listening actively: Listening to understand, checking assumptions,
      building on others' ideas, not simply waiting our turns to talk; and
    * Assuming responsibility: In our case, for the work of making the
      classroom an effective place for learning, which means being more than a
      spectator.
***** Teaching Styles *****
Prof. Briggs's style for leading discussions is relatively Socratic: not just
posing a question but posing a follow-on and then another. The objective is not
to test your knowledge or recall so much as to sharpen your capacity to think
critically about the course's key themes, to recognize assumptions behind your
arguments, and to help you learn how to learn systematically from cases (from
specifics to general principles). This includes pushing you to consider what
may be unwelcome implications of your first ideas (responses). It also means
ensuring that you grasp the arguments in major planning readings, which is
distinct from encouraging you to simply voice your opinion on an issue. We will
do the latter, too, but we should recognize that these two thingsâopining vs.
making arguments that address the assigned materialâhave distinct values in
terms of your learning in the course.
Other faculty teach according to their own style, some following a much more
lecture-driven mode with a straightforward Q&amp;A (you, the student, ask the
questions, and the lecturer answers as best s/he can, then the next student
asks a question, and so on).
***** The Classroom: Friday Sections *****
These are designed to complement the main class meetings in several ways:
proceeding at a pace that ensures comprehension regardless of how much
background preparation, of a given type, you bring to the MCP program; giving
you a chance to ask questions you might not ask in the main class meetings; and
giving you a chance to build useful working relationships with a smaller group
of classmates as well as your section instructor. All of this is crucial for
learning effectively in a course that moves quickly, along a very multi-faceted
agenda, with a large group of students who do not share a common reference
point for planning's roles or a common educational background pre-DUSP.
***** The Teaching Team *****
Prof. Briggs's role is to design and manage Gateway and teach a variety of case
sessions, including those that connect the distinct units of the course; he
also designs and administers the exam and makes final decisions about
assignments and grades. The other faculty members teach cases, designed to
contribute to our course objectives, which draw on their special strengths and
experience. Prof. Abbanat leads the writing diagnostic and offers feedback on
drafts for the written assignments when approached by students. Three DUSP
doctoral students support the course by leading review (recitation) sessions,
grading and offering feedback on two of the written assignments under Prof.
Briggs's direction, and shaping the assignments and content of class meetings
as well. Each of them is engaged in interesting, cutting-edge research (just
ask them).
***** Course Materials *****
We will cover quite a range of ideas and historical developments that define
planningâand at a relatively brisk pace. For most class sessions, you will
read assigned material guided by specific study questions, though you are
welcome to go beyond them. The questions, which also provide a guide to study
group work, are linked to our central objectives for the case (or other
discussion topic) at hand, which is linked in turn to the larger course focus
on planning's defining traditions and dilemmas. Most readings and all study
questions will be in course readers available for purchase and also on reserve
at Rotch Library. Because we like to take advantage of current events and
customize discussions, the readers are not prepared all at once but edited
until a few weeks ahead of your use.
The following required texts are available through the MIT bookstore, as well
as online and other booksellers; several copies are also on library reserve at
Rotch:
[Amazon_logo] Campbell, Scott, and Susan Fainstein, eds. Readings in Planning
Theory. 2nd ed. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003. ISBN: 9780631223474.
[Amazon_logo] Forester, John. Planning in the Face of Power. Berkeley, CA:
University of California Press, 1989. ISBN: 9780520064133.
[Amazon_logo] Susskind, Lawrence, and Jeffrey Cruikshank. Breaking the Impasse:
Consensual Approaches to Resolving Public Disputes. New York, NY: Basic Books,
1989. ISBN: 9780465007509.
***** Why These Books? *****
The first ("RPT") is an important anthology of many key issues. It also makes a
thoughtful case for how reflecting on planning theory improves planning
practice. The second delves deep into planners' everyday encounters with their
publics and even the interpersonal dimensions of practicing in ways that are
ethical and effective, whereas much commentary about planning remains broad,
structural, and sometimes abstract too.
We will also use excerpts of these important books, which are on course reserve
at Rotch, among others:
[Amazon_logo] Friedmann, John. Planning in the Public Domain: From Knowledge to
Action. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1987. ISBN: 9780691022680.
[Amazon_logo] Hartman, Chester, and Gregory Squires, eds. There is No Such
Thing as a Natural Disaster: Race, Class, and Hurricane Katrina. New York, NY:
Routledge, 2006. ISBN: 9780415954877.
[Amazon_logo] Sanyal, Bishwapriya, ed. Comparative Planning Cultures. New York,
NY: Routledge, 2005. ISBN: 9780415951357.
[Amazon_logo] Scott, James. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve
the Human Condition Have Failed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1999.
ISBN: 9780300078152.
These last four include, respectively: (a) a sweeping intellectual history of
modern planning and what Friedmann calls its four main traditions (the book is
dense in many places but a treasure trove if you're interested in whose ideas
influenced whom and around what seminal world events); (b) a range of critical
analyses of post-Katrina recovery planning and politics, relevant to our team
assignment; (c) an effort to ask, of contemporary planning, "are there shared
cultures of planning or are very different societies on very different tracks,
and if so, why?"; and (d) an incisive history, by a political anthropologist,
focused on what rational modernist planningâand its "schemes"âset out to
do, why, and with what results.
