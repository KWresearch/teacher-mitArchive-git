Lecture 9: Planning as Citizen Participation 
 

I.  Discussion of Sherry Arnstein's Ladder of Participation 
 
2 Global Points about Social Ladder Reading: 
1. Not just a social equity or social empowerment conversation 
    Think about extreme instances to engage public in planning 

 

2.  It is a normative diagram – about “shoulds.”  Its main effort is to replace 
top-down/technocratic approaches to planning 

 
Arnstein makes major criticisms of traditional agency-oriented approaches to civic 
participation.  She asserts that more often than not participation is: 
 

•  Exclusionary 
•  Non-representative 
•  Terribly incomplete/ full of thin simplifications 

 
However, Arnstein provides an unfocused alternative rife with new power grabs, new 
forms of exclusion, abuse, and process paralysis 
 
eg:  stories in Arnstein’s transpose complaints – very universal 
 
Some background behind Arnstein’s critique: 
 

Modernist planning: 
•  Comes from enlightenment (where does mandate come from? From voters to 
elected officials)  
•  Planners steer the machinery of government, planners direct planning and 
implementation. 

 
U.S.  – 1950’s   
 

- heyday of modernist planning  
– Urban Renewal “blight removal” 
•  Growing case that is it very exclusionary, not value free, program to 
modernist planning as weapon to eliminate unwanted people 
•  Planners responding to elected officials -              
•  1960s, protests 
•  Lyndon Johnson “Great Society,” war on poverty,  mandated participation 
requirements  

 
 

Model Cities 
•  an effort to give target cities, $ and break from bureaucracy, antecedent to 
Clintonian “empowerment zones” 
•  Rupture, how does planning get rethought? 

 
Arnstein  

Why does she focus on citizen power? 

Why participation = power 

 
 
A lot of participation forms are tokenism 
Instead, Participation should include: 
1. Agenda setting (defining issues and stake holders) 
2. Strategy making ( heart of planning) 
3. Participatory design – how to make these most effective – being user-oriented is 
implicit part of Arnstein’s argument.  Participatory design can limit impasse – 
structure can improve the caliber and product of conversations. 
 
 

A brief review of US federalism in relation to Arnsten: 
3 levels: 
Federal 
State 
Local  
 
 A.  Arnstein calls improvements at the local level -  “something closer to the people 
than city hall” 
 
1.  Organized at sub-local level (not everyone is able to do that) 
But cannot influence a pre-conceived plan 
2.  Tyranny from below: having organizations physically and socially closely linked 
has positive impacts 
3.  A legitimate popular mandate can lead to bad ideas, with no promise of 
successful outcome.  What assures the quality of ideas? 
 
Arnstein’s ladder depends on the decision making power and the ability to borrow 
from city government.  Arnstein didn’t write with the idea in mind that federal 
planning funding would evaporate. 
 

•  Channeling money into receivership – gain independence from larger decision 
makers  
•  Advising is not the same as deciding 
•  Broader range of ideas- wish lists versus analysis 
•  Balancing community input with different types of knowledge 

 

II.  Who knows (expertise: metis and formal codified knowledge) 
 
Consider:  Pressure politics  
               Sources of accountability 
Why participate in the public” – advising versus deciding – rational for participating 
in the public – planning together 
 
(Psychological) Consultation is appreciated (procedural justice) 
(Political) taking public action imbued with a genuine public mandate 
(Practical) two heads can be better than one (contradiction – group think) 
 
Class participation in group exercise:

How do you set an agenda?   How can you be mindful of priorities, brokering 
resources (but assuming that taking advantage of investments would hinge on 
utilizing particular funding streams) 
 
Where does the mandate for the public good come from?  Short-term versus long 
term.  How do you instill a value that you need a process?  What is the organizing 
ethos within planning?  How does it pay off?  Building capacity and momentum.  
Does it all begin on day 1? 
 
What makes knowledge more useful?  Don’t discriminate.  What do we know about 
everyday needs?  Intelligence gathering, open ended questions are very generative 
(of responses, informative), weekday, weekend, etc. 
What institutions are important to you.   
 
Stories of why you are in this condition?  Several versions – how and why? Don’t 
have one type of conversations 
 
Civil society helping community movements move forward, government 
accomplishing projects (with community partnerships) 
 
Participation Assumptions and Realities 
 
Last assumption: Consider the known, the known unknowns, and unknown, 
unknowns.
