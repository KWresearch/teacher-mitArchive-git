Gateway: Planning Action

Today’s agenda
(cid:139) Lecture-discussion
(cid:132) What are the issues and stakes?
(cid:132) What drives population change?
(cid:132) Where does—or might—planning fit in?
(cid:139) Case discussion (a): Sydney case in 
Sandercock, “When strangers become 
neighbors”
(cid:139) Case discussion (b): Planning education

What’s the issue?
Diversity 
accommodation
encounter Resistance 
Competition conflict
Cooperation Tolerance?
Melting pots, salad 
bowls, gumbo?
Cultural fusion >< enclaves
Preservation
ANXIETY change …
border-crossings

Specialist Areas
Integration
Cohesion
Equality
Public Services
Citizenship
Identity
Britishness

(From a business card, former staff member of the UK Commission on Racial Equality)

Let’s distinguish
1. Diversity as a matter of population 
make-up (the composition of a project 
team, organization, neighborhood, 
region, nation); from
2. Expectations about how that diversity 
will be handled.
The past 40-50 years have brought a 
revolution, still underway, in both …

How make-up shifts

Basic demography: components of 
population change in society

(Births 
minus 
deaths)

Natural 
increase
(+ or -)

In-Migration 
(+)

Out-Migration
(-)

So what’s up with 
natural increase?
In OECD nations, birth rate is way down:

is way up, so …

Population

rapid, slow and 
zero-growth 
nations: Kenya, 
U.S., and Italy.
Age structures 
shape economy, 
politics, crime, 
popular culture—
everything.

Pyramids: Kenya, United States, and Italy, 1995.”

The Pyramid is
“Color Coded”
U.S. Age Pyramid, Census 2000

The top is mostly white, the middle and bottom 
increasingly nonwhite.

Migration is the second major 
driver of shifting make-up
U.S. example: The second major wave of immigration is primarily non-
European, unlike the first, permitted by (a) policy and driven by (b) economic 
push/pull factors and (c) political instability outside the recipient country.

Basic Economic 
Implications
(cid:139) Workforce: Who will work to ensure 
economic prosperity? (workforce make-up 
and skill building needs)
(cid:139) Consumer Demand: Who will the consumers 
be? (from “niche” to mainstream markets)
(cid:139) Social Security: Who will be paying in to the 
system 30 years from now so that today’s 
workers can withdraw funds then (as 
retirees)?

Expectations: what 
about identity? 
There’s a much 
longer-run way to look 
at migration and what 
it means to be 
“native” (or not) to
a place …

Four “kinds” of Americans

1.

Indigenous 
(“American Indian”)
2. Settlers
3. Slaves
Immigrants
4.
With battles over who 
is “native” or 
“mainstream,” how to 
handle history in the 
present day.

Assimilation or Convergence?

Model 1: Assimilation

Model 2: Convergence

Fixed boundary, 
newcomers and 
natives move in (or 
not).

See Alba and Nee, Remaking the American Mainstream (2003)

Fluid boundary 
(what’s 
mainstream shifts), 
groups cross that 
boundary (or not).

Identity and Nationhood
What makes 
someone 
“French”?
Born in Senegal, Semou Diouf, 
50, has spoken French all his 
life and was educated in France 
but says he still feels like an 
outsider, despite living under a 
Constitution that is officially 
color blind. (NYT 11-Nov-05)

Where does—or 
might— planning 
fit in?

Sandercock’s 1st Four: 
Challenges
(cid:139) “The values and norms of the dominant 
culture are usually embedded in legislative 
frameworks of planning.” (government)
(cid:139) … and also in the attitudes and practices of 
“flesh-and-blood planners.”
(cid:139) Planning as a weapon: Xenophobia or racism 
in “communities” (civil society) is expressed 
through planning system.
(cid:139) Planners “come up against cultural practices 
that are incommensurable with their own 
values” (Israeli planning example).

The built 
environment is 
suffused with 
deeply rooted 
beliefs and cultural 
history, mostly 
taken for granted …

OK, so it’s a 
subdivision
“Set among beautiful woodlands 
and meadows, The Estates at 
Princeton Junction provides a 
serene environment in a prime 
location. Just a quick 2-minute 
drive or a short walk from the 
Princeton Junction train station and 
minutes from historic Princeton, 
your family will enjoy all the culture 
and convenience this exclusive 
location has to offer.
A luxurious Princeton, NJ Carriage 
Luxury Home community.”

Place Names Reflect 
Cultural Origins, Signal 
Status
Miami Herald humorist Dave Barry 
names a new subdivision:
“The Estates at the Junction at 
the Woodland near the River 
of the Place at Runyon Falls 
by the Sea”

Mariposa
Andalusia
Marbella
Santa [whatever]

Rancho
Hacienda
Villa

Or blend and stir: “Andalusia at Coral 
Mountain” (luxury retirement community)

Sandercock’s 2nd Four: 
Remedies
(cid:139) “Overhaul” the planning system (root-
and-branch reform).
(cid:139) Rely on market mechanisms.
(cid:139) Promote dialogue, including 
“therapeutic” process.
(cid:139) Educate planners “to work in cross-
cultural contexts.”

Fainstein’s counter

(cid:139) Recognize trade-offs: Diversity may 
come at a price in terms of other things 
we value.
(cid:139) Diversity should not be “privileged” over 
other goods.
(cid:139) Promote the “just city” (democracy, 
diversity, equity, growth, sustainability). 

Globalization: 
Homogeneity, 
Manufactured 
Authenticity?

Parts of a
learning agenda?
(cid:139) Knowledge: Develop a critical understanding of how 
culture and power have shaped planning systems in 
the places you want to work.
(cid:139) Skill: Enhance your own cultural competence—for 
specific tasks (mobilizing, facilitation, consultation).
(cid:139) Personal Resources: Develop more emotional 
intelligence (e.g., “reading” cues). Interaction as jazz.
(cid:139) Disposition: Practice active curiosity and respect, 
beyond tolerance.

Ours is not a caravan of despair.
