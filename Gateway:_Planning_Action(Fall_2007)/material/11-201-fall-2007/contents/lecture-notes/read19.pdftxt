Tips and questions 
 
In this session, we want to build on the discussions we’ve had about 
participation, communication, and the aims of planning beyond the modernist 
model. I refer to planning that’s committed to reason (the rational element) 
and savvy about stakeholder interests and values (the political element) but 
also able to produce an inclusive dialogue (a partly cultural element), not just 
a volley of opinions. 
1.  The case: Singapore has long been a quite autocratic and government-
dominated society but is experimenting, as the case notes, with more 
“consultative” decision-making. What is the problem(s) facing Singapore 
Tourism Board (STB) decision-makers at the end of this case? Is there, in 
your view, a significant problem?) What should they do about the 
problem(s)? 

2.  What kinds of learning seem to be called for in this case? Who needs to 
learn, and what do they need to learn? 

3.  Given the distinctions in the “Planning Together” tool, and also the points 
about “Organizing and Planning” in the other tool, is it clear what the 
purposes of the Chinatown consultation process are? Think about who is 
doing the consulting, why, and how.
