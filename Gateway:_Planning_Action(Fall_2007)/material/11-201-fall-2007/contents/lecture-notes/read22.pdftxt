Tips and questions 

Except for some brief discussion about what information and communication 
technologies do or don’t change about planning as a tool and target for civic 
engagement in public life and decisionmaking, we’ve not explored the role of still-
emerging technologies in the field. In this session, we’ll do just that with help from 
guest lecturer Dennis Frenchman of our CDD group, using the case of a digital 
corridor in Zaragoza, Spain. 

At DUSP, we’re using the labels “smart city” and “responsive city” to capture the 
idea that digital media make it increasingly possible for cities to respond to their 
user-citizens’ needs dynamically and interactively. We want to explore not only 
about the technical possibilities, of course, but—appropriate for Gateway—to focus 
on what the use of these technologies implies for the public, as well as for the role 
of planning and planners. 

1.  Who should determine the information and “events” to be carried in Zaragoza’s 
“Digital Mile” and why? What are the possibilities here for planning differently? 
What skills—old or new—might smarter cities demand of planners? 

2.  However legitimated or carried out, modern planning and its still-evolving 
alternatives have long claimed that planning is a collective enterprise of people 
sharing particular places. What do the “discontinuities” and reshaped 
boundaries, discussed by Mitchell, imply for the collective or the sense of 
common enterprise in cities? 

3.  Castells discusses key trends shaping societies worldwide but highlights key 
distinctions among cities in America versus Europe versus developing country 
cities, including “mega-cities.” What are those key distinctions?
