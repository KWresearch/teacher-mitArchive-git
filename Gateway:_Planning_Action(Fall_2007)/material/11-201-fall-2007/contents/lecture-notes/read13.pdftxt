Tips and questions 
 
One of the major justifications for planning interventions is to serve the 
public interest. Sometimes, the public interest is argued to override personal 
or private interests, as in the case of land “takings” by the government. This 
classic planning issue has recently been at the forefront of news, both in the 
U.S. and overseas, because of popular protests against city governments 
that have taken private land, including homes, to enable economic 
development projects that are led by private developers. 
 
This class session we will compare recent land takings in two case contexts, 
using comparison to explore conceptions of the public interest and private 
rights in planning. 
 
In the first case, a private citizen, Susette Kelo, sued her city government—
New London, in our neighboring state of Connecticut—after the government 
tried to expropriate her house as part of its plans to revitalize this 
economically depressed city. The City’s plan, more specifically, was to 
promote commercial uses and higher-income houses, to be developed by a 
private developer.  This closely watched case, Kelo v. New London, was 
argued all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court found in favor of 
the City. Public outcry over this decision has triggered reactions by most 
state governments to restrict planning powers in order to prevent localities 
from acting as New London did.  Many planners in the U.S. have been

dismayed to find that basic planning actions are now jeopardized by the 
change in public sentiment. 
 
In the second case, we overview planning controversies in two Asian 
transition countries: Vietnam and China.  These are currently the two fastest 
growing economies in the world.  Interestingly, in both countries, the 
Communist Party firmly controls national economic policies and the state 
owns all land, but land use rights can be sold and transferred privately and 
private real estate markets have emerged rapidly.  The urban periphery of 
these countries has seen rapid land development conversions from rural to 
urban uses where private fortunes have been made in a short amount of 
time. Local governments have been key to this phenomenon by exercising 
their strong powers of expropriation and of granting land use rights according 
to their master land use plans, which are created without community input. 
Popular protests, sometimes violent, have arisen to challenge the way 
windfall gains from urban development have not trickled down to those who 
have been forced to make way for the projects. 
 
The Grindle and Thomas chapter overviews some of the basic differences in 
the policy environments of the U.S. and in the developing world.  It will also 
be helpful in preparing for the Narmada case memo assignment. 
 
1.  What are the similarities and differences between the two cases? That is, 
think about the current phenomenon of takings for local economic 
development in the context of Asian transition countries alongside what is 
happening in the United States, most recently in the Kelo v. New London 
decision. In particular, how do the differences in institutional context in 
each case shape the process by which planners—acting in either context—
might define the public interest? 

2.  Historically, planning theory as an academic field has been dominated by 
Western, and in particular American, scholarship. Think back to readings 
you did recently for 11.201, including Davidoff on advocacy planning. 
What might Davidoff say about the takings in the US, China, and 
Vietnam? How does the concept of advocacy planning help us understand 
the situation?  Given Grindle and Thomas’ characterization of some 
basic differences between Western industrialized countries and developing 
countries, how might Davidoff’s arguments not apply to the latter or apply 
differently? 

 
In our next class, you will be assigned to a group to explore together how a 
particular ethical position might frame the land takings controversies.
