Tips and questions 
This time, read the textbook (concepts) first, which includes many vivid and 
accessible examples, and then our discussion case. This is the first of two 
sessions in which we examine what it means for planners to act mainly as 
facilitators rather than solution-providing experts. 
 
1.  In the Susskind and Cruikshank book, read chapters 1 and 2 closely, 
and then focus on the subheadings in Chapter 3 (the main arguments 
under each), not the details of the many case examples they give. 
Susskind and Cruikshank assume that planning must function in settings 
where a variety of interests and perhaps values will be conflict. Broadly, 
their work is also in the “pluralism” category of planning theory. It’s also 
worth nothing that they are concerned with planning in democratic 
societies, but the ideas have a wider application. Their book diagnoses a 
fundamental problem in planning and decision-making and then 
prescribes dispute resolution—or negotiated agreement among interested 
parties or “stakeholders”—as a remedy. What exactly is the big problem 
they are trying to remedy? What alternative approaches to disputes do 
they outline, and why—according to the authors—are those alternatives 
inadequate? 

2.  Read through the main case and epilogue. What are the sources of 
conflict over the Devils Tower in the case, and how did the public officials 
in the case handle the conflict? From the standpoint of the Susskind-
Cruikshank model, how would you assess their handling of the situation?
