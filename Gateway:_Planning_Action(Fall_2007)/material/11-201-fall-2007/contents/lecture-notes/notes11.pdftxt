I. Two Humble Requests 
 
Reading is more challenging, can seem inconsistent.  We are trying to see 
essentials of planning and be persistent in face of jargon.  Inclusive planning writers 
have jargon but not inclusive language – please be patient. 
 

II. Review 
 
To understand how we got to communicative planning as dialogue, we’ll trace 
how we got here.  First, in response to Altshuler, he says we need interest grou give 
and take because he is in response to modernist rational model.  The modernist 
rational model was a reaction of (or response to) physical problems (slums, etc) but 
more so a response to capitalist decision making which Xav calls ‘Parochial decision 
making.’  Parochial because it was political decision making. 
Arnstein critiques differently, she says that politics isn’t really giving people a 
voice.  She was in NYC, while Altshuler was in MN and didn’t see participation.  
Altshuler says the pluralist discover by talking to people while Arnstein looks at how 
things are working.  Arnstein believes 1) participation does not equal citizen power 
because she cares for the disadvantaged and marginalized and 2) it is an empty 
ritual. 

Susskind argues that interest group (pluralist) politics is a competition to 
have voices heard and he wants joint problem solving.  He believes that Altshuler’s 
interest groups lead to continuous impasse. Therefore, we need to supplement 
electoral politics (mandated theory) and administrative state to not replace or 
supplant but to use ad hoc process to get stakeholder work to generate better 
options(e.g. win-win, joint-game, less win-lose).  He also believes that special 
interests are not accountable to public interests. He believes in the ‘machinery of 
power’ where we’re not trying to supplant that but take ideas back to the political 
realm. 

Healy argues for dialogue and hearing both sides of the issue.  We need to 
get beyond give and take of interest group by creating shared meaning and language 
and a sense of public with a new interest that we didn’t know we had.  Then, maybe 
interests will shift.  Bargaining is still important, we can’t accomplish everything in 
dialogue 
 
The modern rational model is the comprehensive model in class context.  
Altshuler critiqued comprehensive planning – the 1950’s model of blueprinting, etc. 
 

III. Forrester 
 
 
The class asked what the Forrester article was about, and formulated the 
following answer:  Forrester says it is the job of facilitator to do everything.  There’s 
something beyond the facilitator because everyone at the table must understand 
what’s going on in order to enable dialogue. 
 
Xav read a few passages from Healy (page 239) about new wave ideas where 
we get to discuss new ideas.  This passage is about arenas of discourse and modes 

of discourse (now modes of discourse are managed).  She calls for planners to create 
inclusionary dialogue by asking if there are solutions or process ideas. 
 
The modernist planner thinks of the situation by having an expert designer 
get input or search an idea and then the solutions come.  The pluralist has broad 
interests and looks at the interests of groups.  Arnstein said there is an opportunity 
here to share power by asking many questions.  Forester asks what factions are 
missing.  The answer is user feedback because he just observed meetings.  Healy 
(page 241) says “If we aim for inclusionary language, we have differ in our 
intentions and cites several examples.”  Xav says she may seem idealistic and could 
have spent too much time on process. Susskind says look at alternative outcomes 
instead of compromise. Finally, are we expecting too much of planners here? 
 
Back in the rational planning days, planners had the answers and were 
process experts.  There is a middle-ground/third way/different hats where there are 
all the same terms for planners using different processes in different situations.  One 
must be aware in these kinds of situations. 
 
Forrester says we do core work:  political argumentation.  He wraps all duties 
into one planner and says we must be communicators and shape attention in framing 
(who needs to be there shaping the talk). 
 
At this point in the lecture, there is a very long class discussion about what 
kind of planners we’ll be and there is a discussion about Architectural theory and 
practice (they do use the rational method). 
 
Xav now continues with the explanation of Forrester.  Forrester later gives 
into planners imbedded in their organizations (shaping colleagues) because it 
captures organizational and public scenarios.  He asks how would modern or pluralist 
handle the park scenarios and how dialogue would be thought of by different people.  
He’s concerned with all lenses.  Sense-making versus searching process are two 
different ways of conceiving what design is all about. 
 
Forrester convened the community to discuss parks to learn what is at stake 
and how people use the park.  He is not focused on technical planning of parks to be 
successful, but on the wider view of boundaries and who should use it and how will it 
makes sense.  Xav asks how do questions and materials at meetings shape what 
people think about the parks? 
 
Forrester says critical listening is important because it distinguishes between 
talking and being hearth.  Listen for meaning.  Be attentive to intent in yourself.  
Personal effectiveness is an industry today that teaches businesspeople to run more 
effectual meetings. 

IV.  Question for Reflection 
 
 
Xav asks each student to take out a piece of paper and on one side answer 
the following questions: 
1)  What strengths/weaknesses do you bring as practitioner? 
2)  What professional skills do you have to work on? 
Xav ends the class with a story about the Aspen Round Table.  They taught the 
theory of change using models and mapping cause and effect.  Later, a leader in the 
roundtable would tell Xav that they could not get people to think that way, it was 
very challenging to get people who are attached to ideas to change.
