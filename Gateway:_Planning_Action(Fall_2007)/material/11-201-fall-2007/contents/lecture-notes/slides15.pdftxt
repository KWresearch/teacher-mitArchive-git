Class 1: Planning from Above v. 
Planning from Below

by

Prof. Balakrishnan 
Rajagopal

Planning from above v. Planning 
from below
• Planning in the Rest is fundamentally different in many 
ways from planning in the West
• Planning and its relation to the grand project of 
development, understood as the move from culture & 
tradition to rational modernity
• Critics of this move – Gandhi to Jane Jacobs to 
Habermas to Friedman to Scott to Escobar
• The rise of social movements, the redefinition and 
expansion of democracy and the stasis of the state
• Disparate and severe impact of planning along ethnic, 
racial and national lines

Planning from above

• Rational modernist planning – perspective
• State but also other actors including IO’s, 
private sector and NGOs, depending on 
the method
• Tools – expertise
• Utilitarian approach – greater common 
good, national interest, etc
• Power as the heart of planning

Friedman and planning from below

• Central to social mobilization tradition is human 
emancipation and structural change through action from 
below
• Focus of the critique was industrialization 
• Non institutional politics and alternatives to development
•
Issues: spontaneity versus formal organization; people 
versus elites; ‘for’ or ‘against’ organizing; forms of 
struggle – violence versus non violence
“Planning is not, in principle, exclusively a function of the 
State”
• Radical planning and social learning

•

Background to the project and 
current status - I
• Dams as Temples of modern India
• Socio-environmental Location 
•
Inter-state politics
• Adjudication of water disputes and the 1979 ruling
• World Bank and other donor involvement
• 30 big dams, 135 medium dams and 3000 small dams
• Who is ‘project-affected’(excluding the canal oustees, 
fisherpeople, landless laborers, casual laborers)
• Question of land ownership and titles and their link to 
resettlement and rehabilitation – impact of colonial land 
laws and caste discrimination

Background to the project and 
current status - II
• Evolution of planning from above and 
below – planning and resistance dialectic
• Victory of the global campaign?
• Key moments of planning from below
• Judicial role and 2000 judgment
• Recent events – 2005 judgment and the 
CoM report
• Role of movement insiders v. outsiders 
and the problem of representation

Problems with Planning from above 
- Institutions and Power
• Water disputes jurisdiction and inter-state 
structure
• Weak Central government
• Ineffective and unaccountable specialized 
agencies like the NCA, GRA
• Very weak or absent local government
• Failure of the judiciary
• Unaccountable international institutions
• Lack of available land for R&R

Problems with Planning from above 
- Democracy
• What is the ‘demos’ here – unit of 
democracy?
• Is democracy simply a mechanism for 
aggregation of collective preferences from 
a rational choice perspective?
• The utilitarian idea of ‘national interest’ as 
collective welfare
• Question of trust in governance

Problems with Planning from above 
- Technocracy
• hydrology and engineering - the question of availability of 
water in the river 
• WCD - 30-70% of dams worldwide not viable on 
technical and financial grounds
• Planning on paper v. planning in action – the lack of 
good faith, deceitful behavior, and gross negligence
• Where is the benefit-cost analysis and  post-project 
evaluation?
• Lack of interest in alternatives to large dams – why?
• Expertise – does it lead to flattening of difference, 
centralization of power and forced social change?

Planning from below 

• Planning from below as non-institutional politics
• Both forms of politics co-exist in development 
planning - Friedman
• NBA as a social movement - distinction between 
NGO, SM and civil society, state, market –
planning from below as a ‘subaltern’ activity
• Key role of protest – what Tarrow calls 
‘conventions of contention’
• Alternative development or alternatives to 
development?
• Hegemonic v. counter-hegemonic planning from 
below

Planning from below as a radical 
critique of democracy
• Nature of India’s democracy – problem of 
extreme inequality (class, caste and gender) co-
existing with political equality
• Loss of moral credibility and Crisis of the State in 
the 1970s including emergency
• The rise of social movements – new v. old 
movements and deepening of democracy – NBA 
as a movement
• Strong development = weak democracy?
• What is the institutional program of planning 
from below?

Planning from below as a radical 
critique of technocracy
• As a critique of a specific kind of ‘authoritarian 
choiceless technocracy’
• Technocracy as a language of power expressed 
through rationality and communicative action
• Indigenous knowledge, local technology and 
public speech through protest – are they 
enough?
• Critique of technocracy and centralization (Roy’s 
critique of Single Authority)
• What is the goal of technocracy – is it 
development and if so, who defines it and how?

Planning from below - a radical critique 
of modernity and other dilemmas
• How to be modern and different (Calderon)
• Small scale alternatives to dams and refocus on 
the politics of human development (e.g., 
jeevanshalas) 
• Political ethics of elite and non-elite alliances –
Role of Roy
• The role of foreign NGOs and foreign funding
• Gujarati nationalism
• How to evaluate ‘success’ of planning from below? 

Problems with Planning from Below

• Lack of adequate public opinion support
• Lack of access to institutional tools to 
operationalize alternatives to the dams, 
such as regulatory authority and access to 
finance
• Lack of international leverage after 1993b
• David v. Goliath?
