GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 1

Today’s agenda

1. Rethink planning’s interest in 
(obsession with?) 
“participation”—in transition to 
final part of the course.
2. Understand the “participation 
industry” that interest has created.
3. Examine the promise and limits of 
contemporary information and 
communication technologies (ICT) 
in particular.

Slide 2

Review and extension

(cid:131) Modernist planning led to some successes but 
many disasters—and much criticism, especially 
of top-down, profession-dominated practice.
(cid:131) Advocates of “deep democracy” have pushed 
the professional field and the project of 
planning hard.
(cid:131) Some planners have become full-time 
participation facilitators and managers 
(“industry”).
(cid:131) New technologies—the internet, ubiquitous GIS, 
etc.—seem to offer many opportunities.
(cid:131) More and more problems are cross-sector 
problems, not just problems for public policy 
(let alone privately driven design).

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 3

Three broad transitions underway

(cid:131) In the role of “active citizens”: From making 
claims to processing claims (getting in the role of 
decisionmakers) and deliberating. Example: 
participatory budgeting in Brazil, deliberative polls.
(cid:131) In focus: From expanding channels for 
participation to enabling better problem-solving. 
Problem-solving may be the only reason citizens 
(and others) stay involved in public affairs.
(cid:131) In scope of efforts: From devising better plans to 
co-producing change through deliberation, 
negotiation, collective learning, and constituency 
building.

Slide 4

Three broad purposes of participation in 
planning

Agenda setting

Strategy making

Participatory design 
and/or 
implementation

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Define issues and 
stakes for collective 
attention

Analyze, devise best-
possible courses of 
action on given set of 
issues and stakes
Design and/or 
implement specific 
projects that advance 
the strategies.
Slide 5

Risks, in lieu of clear purposes

(cid:131) Letting the tactics 
drive things. Tactical 
specialists have 
strong incentives to 
recommend their 
specialties.
(cid:131) Sending mixed 
signals, creating 
confusion, conflict.
(cid:131) Missing opportunities 
to do smarter stuff.

America Speaks “virtual tour” online.
Usefulness: Helps gauge citizen reaction quickly, 
generate momentum, sense of collective project. Very 
text driven, limited by table facilitators filtering input.

Usefulness: Helps “tame 
complexity,” revealing 
options and their 
implications more fully. 
Does not provide a process.

Ideas

Usefulness: 
Great in the 
right context 
(time and 
place).
But having 
ideas is one 
thing, refining 
and acting on 
them is 
something else.

Or “deliberative polling” and 
other “deliberative designs”

Deliberative polling: A 
randomly drawn group of 
citizens, with access to 
“experts,” deliberates a 
public issue and makes 
policy recommendations.

Examples
Static web content describes 
services, representatives, how to 
access.
Interface allows someone to pay a 
parking ticket or contract with 
government online. See “e-citizen 
centre” at Singapore government 
website.
E-DEMOCRACY Technology supports better 
governance through deliberation, 
more.

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 17

Purpose: Just transaction or 
transformation (non-routine problem-
solving, broader social change)?

Slide 18

Pursuing “e-democracy” through 
“democratizing data” or “community 
informatics” (GIS, public data, etc.)

Many failed efforts failed to understand this 
knowledge loop or cycle as a social process:

Data

(analysis)

Information
Decisions
(interpretation, advocacy deliberation)
