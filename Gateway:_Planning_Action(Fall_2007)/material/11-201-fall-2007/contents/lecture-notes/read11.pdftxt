Tips and questions 
As we have seen, modern planning was born on very big and debatable 
assumptions—mostly about who could and should “guide society” and how. 
Not surprisingly, modernist or rational planning came under severe criticism, 
especially on political grounds. But much of that criticism stayed at the 
broad, structural level without offering much advice on the micro-level, 
everyday settings in which planners actually practice. Sticking with the focus 
on planners as facilitators, today’s aim is to focus on the micro level. 

1.  Healey claims that rational planning clashed with a very structural 
political economy perspective, which focused on “who gets.” She further 
claims that the who-gets perspective has important limitations vis-à-vis 
the planning challenges that confront today’s world. What are the major 
implications of the “communicative” alternative that Healey presents as a 
paradigm shift? (She offers a re-definition of planning based on that 
alternative, for example.) 

2.  Forester is one of the major thinkers in the communicative school of 
thought. In Planning in the Face of Power, start on page 4 with the 
paragraph that begins “The vocation of planning …” and stop on the next 
page, toward the bottom, where the paragraphs ends “… a substantively 
democratic planning process.” Then read the three core chapters, the last 
of which is the synthesis of Forester’s arguments about how planners 
should think about their practice. Why is listening so vital for effective 
planning practice, according to Forester, and what defines “critical” 
listening, in particular? Does he convince you that the model of design as 
a “search process” is inadequate? Why or why not? What required 
planning skills or competencies are implied by the alternative model he 
offers: design-as-sensemaking?
