Tips and questions 
 
The planning decisions in the Narmada case have been taken not only by 
government and civil society groups (as a simple dichotomy) but by myriad 
distinct actors: multiple levels of government, multiple government jurisdictions 
that the project traverses, influential international agencies (The World Bank, 
International Labor Organization, United Nations Development Program, and 
bilateral funders), local social movement organizations, and local and national 
and “transnational” advocacy groups and networks of same. This is “multi-level 
planning.” 
 
1.  Caufield concludes her critique of the World Bank’s fifty-year history with a 
look at why the Bank needs to continue lending and how this gives the Bank 
leverage over the laws, development aims, project decisions, and more of 
borrower nations. This brief reading is useful background for the decision 
memo; it brings the Bank’s role to the forefront. 

2.  According to Rajagopal, why did the mobilization begin in the Valley at first, 
what forms did it take and who was responsible for initiating it?  Could the 
planners of the project have anticipated the mobilization and done anything 
to address it? Don’t let the legal theory terminology dissuade you, especially 
if it’s unfamiliar: Look past the specialized terms to the main ideas. You will 
NOT be asked to write about legal theory.

3.  What concrete forms did the mobilization take locally versus globally, and 
how would you judge its effectiveness?  Does formal democracy constrain or 
enable social mobilization as a form of planning? In light of the World 
Commission report and the specifics of the Narmada case, is mobilization 
simply a critique—a reaction against traditional forms of development 
planning—or might it be an articulation of real alternatives to development 
planning practice?
