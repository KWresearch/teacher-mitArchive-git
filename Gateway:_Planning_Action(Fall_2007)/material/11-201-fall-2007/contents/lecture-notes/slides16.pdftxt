the Role of Law

Multi-level Planning in a global age 

• Planning is always multi-level with some 
exceptions
• In much of the Third World, it has always been 
global – colonialism to globalization
• Global discourses, Transnational fields and 
epistemic communities (Haas)
• The impact of ‘framing’ an issue as local, 
domestic or international - impact on actors, 
resources, strategies used in mobilization, and 
evaluation of results  

•

Multi-level planning – actors and 
rules of the game 
• Actors – not just the local state or a ‘planner’ in the 
abstract
Includes donors, IO’s, state, private sector, civil society, 
PAFs (‘victims’) and media
• Rules of the game – 2 kinds – macro (rules which 
provide criteria for whether interventions are achieving 
their goals); and micro (rules that actually apply to the 
conduct of actors as they work towards the goals)
• Macro rules are derived from political philosophy and 
social theory – utilitarianism for instance
• Micro rules are laws – international and domestic – as 
well as institutions (in the sense of new institutionalists) 
which are multi-level 

Multi-level planning 

• Actors – donors, federal, state and local governments, NGOs, 
individuals, media, international organizations, foreign states, local 
and national state officials and agencies, epistemic communities
(Haas), public opinion
• The importance of the State as a key actor in development and the 
increasing importance of hydroelectricity as a form of energy
• Discourses – development, nationalism, environment, security, 
culture, rights, democracy, legitimacy, accountability
• Resources – Donors/IO’s, State, private (both market and NGO), 
media, law 
• Goals – agriculture, water provision, FDI, industrial growth, cultural 
identity, livelihood, land, dignity 
• Strategies – media, use of force, institutional process, protest, 
negotiations, alliance-building, litigation
• Evaluation – modernization paradigm v. justice & rights paradigm

The World Bank as
a planning actor
• Bretton Woods – origins and its transformation and 
reinvention through ‘mission creep’
• Relationship to IMF, and other sources of 
finance/donors
• History of involvement in the Narmada project –
from the Scudder mission to the Morse report in 
1993
Impact of the pull-out on the politics of dam 
construction
Is the World Bank still relevant?
Is it learning from its mistakes?

Role of Law in planning I
• Scale – territorial and subject-matter jurisdiction rules 
• Framework – rules about organizations, Transnational, 
State and non-State
• Resource – access to courts, mobilization tools, 
accountability mechanisms
• Violence – structural violence (land deprivation, 
impoverishment, lack of rehabilitation rights), physical 
violence)
• Legitimation – Social contract rights based (democratic 
theory and law as a tool); Weberian process-based 
(administrative law state); `normalizing’ domination 
• Resistance – terrain of resistance; use of law in 
advocacy, negotiation and litigation

Role of law in planning II

• Is law simply institutional politics?  Yes and No
• Global space of law: proliferation of global norms 
and institutions: human rights, environment
• Transnationalization of Moblization in the valley: 
five stages: 1979-88 (R&R); 1988-91 
(environment); 1991-94 (human rights); 1994-2000 
(legalization/domestication); 2000-2007 (rearguard 
action, still domestic)
• Contestation through the law is a conscious 
strategy in mobilization of SMs: why did the NBA 
do it?  What are the tradeoffs?

Role of law in planning III

• Resort to law can’t be an escape from politics to a 
‘neutral’ arena
• The 2000 judgment 
– PIL
– Structural issues (like composition of the court)
– Implementation
– The different scripts – legal reasoning as an independent 
variable
• Domestic legal culture and nature of legal system 
as major variables in mobilization
• PIL, common law system helped NBA while 
proving to be a mixed blessing

Problems of implementation I

• Lack of implementation and monitoring of policy 
that exists on paper – CoM report
• Lack of land for resettlement - Madhya Pradesh 
government position and Gujarat policy
• Issue of migration and resettlement
• Keeping social capital intact - community dispersal 
and breaking up of social and economic ties
• Definition of PAF: ‘oustees’ in the Tribunal award 
and the various R&R policies
• differences in policies (table) 

Problems of Implementation II

• Cash compensation for some despite the 1979 tribunal 
award - its impact on tribals who don’t connect with a cash 
economy 
• GRA mechanisms in the 2000 judgment
• Underperformance and failure to meet targets
• Bargi dam irrigates only 5% - WCD findings revisited
• Cost overruns
• Undercounting of displaced people
• Not a single dam in India has had a systematic post-project 
evaluation
• India has no R&R policy or law (Cabinet Note exists now).

Thank you!
