Plan for the session 
 
In the last session, we discussed some of the similarities and differences in 
the current controversies surrounding local government land takings for 
economic development in the U.S. and places like China and Vietnam. 
 
During this class, you will be assigned to a small group to assume one of the 
following four ethical stances as described in the Harper and Stein article and 
the brief primer provided in today’s assigned reading: 
 

a)  utilitarian 
b)  Marxist, structuralist 
c)  libertarian 
d)  pluralist 

 
In your group, you will discuss the following and select a spokesperson to 
covey the insights of your group’s discussion: (a) Outline how your assigned 
ethical framework applies in the land takings controversies we discussed last 
class (i.e., take a position on the controversies); (b) Identify some of the 
likely criticisms of your position; and (c) Rebut those criticisms with the best 
arguments that you can think of. 
 
Tips and questions 

Think of a planning controversy with which you have intimate knowledge or 
personal experience.  Try applying at least two of the ethical frameworks to 
the controversy. What action implications or stakeholder views become 
clearer through this exercise?
