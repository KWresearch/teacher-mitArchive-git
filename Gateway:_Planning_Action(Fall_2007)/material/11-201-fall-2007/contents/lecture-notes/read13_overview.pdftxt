Reading Tips and Study Questions: Before Session 13 
OVERVIEW OF THE FINAL UNIT OF THE COURSE 

 
 
Thus far, we have reviewed the evolution of modern planning, as well as some of its 
biggest aspirations and dilemmas. In other words, this has been a critical history, 
not merely a descriptive one. 

We began with Unit A as a brief orientation and then moved quickly into the New 
Orleans case assignment (Unit B) as a window on key dilemmas and possibilities for 
planning action. We used three planning traditions—design, policy analysis, and 
empowerment—to examine what’s good (or not) in a plan, situating the analyses in 
a particular context, with its rich history and complex current circumstance. 

Unit C went deeper into planning history and theory, including older and newer 
planning classics that covered the concept of social reform through “rational” 
design, the relationship between politics and the planning and policymaking 
process, hopes for public participation, the nature of advocacy and conflict, the 
potential and limits of process facilitation, and more. 

Taking stock. At this point, you should be able to explain in your own words (to a 
curious someone), or discuss with a planner colleague, a variety of key ideas that 
inform reflective as well as effective practice in the field: 

•  How the rational or modernist model of planning evolved, in broad terms, 
what its core elements and assumptions were, and why it came under attack; 

•  Why it is typically impossible to define planning as an effort separate and apart 
from politics or, put differently, why technical elements of planning are just a 
part of the larger enterprise of planning action. Put differently, planning draws 
on science but is not just applied science, contrary to what some post-
Enlightenment thinkers and reformers hoped and expected. This doesn’t mean 
that planners need abandon a “commitment to reason,” as Charles Hoch puts it, 
but it does warn us against becoming elitist snobs or, by default, naïve 
technicians; 

•  Why the question of whether particular types of knowledge are legitimate and 
included in planning—trained professionals’ knowledge, so-called local 
knowledge, etc.—is so central to the planning process, even if it can be tricky to 
resolve; 

• 

In light of those questions, what the advocacy planning argument proposes, 
broadly, versus the facilitation and dispute resolution model—and why 
clashes of expectations and “styles” are likely in planning action, especially if the 
process becomes genuinely participatory; and

•  What a focus on the “micro-politics of planning” adds in the way of 
perspective on planning and what planners can do, that is, why it behooves 
professional planners, in particular, to pay attention to persuasion and other 
“argumentation” dynamics of small-scale settings in which we interact, such as 
workplaces or public meetings. 

Looking ahead: Unit D. Building on the foundation of the first three units, this 
final unit of the course addresses more specific questions about what’s fair, 
achievable, and wise in contemporary planning contexts. 

This unit includes our second and final professional communications workshop (on 
effective memo writing) and then two brief memo assignments—one a decision 
memo and the other an informational memo. The first assignment gives you the 
opportunity to submit a draft, receive feedback, and then revise and resubmit. The 
second memo assignment, due in early December, acts as a capstone exercise for 
the course: You will systematically observe and critically interpret “planning action” 
in a public meeting of your choice. 

From India to China, Vietnam to the U.S., and Brazil to Canada, these final weeks 
of the course will let us examine the still-evolving shape of planning, how “top-
down” and “bottom-up” decisionmaking meet, the implications of the emerging 
digital city, planning’s major ethical frameworks, the challenges and opportunities 
linked to cultural diversity (planning for and with diverse publics), and more. 

This next week focuses on planning ethics, with guest lecturer Prof. Annette Kim. 
The questions and readings for Session 13 are on the next page.
