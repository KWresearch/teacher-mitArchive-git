Tips and questions 

The late Don Schön was a DUSP faculty member for many years. His special 
interest was the ways in which practitioners thought about their work as they 
worked, i.e. when confronted by practice problems, and also the ways in which we 
human beings set up prideful “defensive routines” and other barriers that thwart 
our own learning. Note the parallels between Schön’s examples of reflection in 
action and James Scott’s descriptive examples of craft knowledge, such as that 
possessed by riverboat captains, in his chapter on mētis, which you read in mid-
October. 

Charles Hoch’s chapter is an effort to summarize the range of roles planners find 
themselves in and the strategies they employ for succeeding, coping, limiting the 
risk to self and others, and meeting other professional challenges or seizing 
opportunities. He briefly outlines several different kinds of politics—adversary or 
more cooperative, for example—that define the contexts in which planners work. 

In class, I’ll draw on several of the cases we’ve worked on, and I’m asking you to 
think about a few simple questions in preparation: 

1.  What strengths do you bring to planning—as the ambitious, often technical and 
just as often political, ethically demanding enterprise we’ve explored? Think 
about skills as well as special commitments or values you hold. 

2.  What special challenges, if any, can you identify for yourself as a practitioner, 
whether based on personality (emotional make-up and “inner resources”), 
educational and work background so far, the nature of the contexts in which you 
expect to work, or other factors? 

Please jot some notes on these two questions, and bring your notes to class. 
Consider Schön’s call for reflection in action to replace technical rationality as the 
sole source of expert claims, and Hoch’s argument about flexibly employing 
“practical reason,” as part of your self-assessment.
