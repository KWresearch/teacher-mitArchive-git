Required reading: 
 
1.  (Case A) Caroline Tauxe, “Marginalizing Public Participation in Local 
Planning: An Ethnographic Account.” Journal of the American Planning 
Association, vol.61(4), pp. 471-481 (1995). 

2.  (Case B) Pp.1-2, 5-7, and 11 (“Looking forward”) only in Xavier de Souza 
Briggs, “Doing Democracy up Close: Culture, Power and Communication in 
Community Building,” Journal of Planning Education and Research, vol. 18, 
pp.1-13 (1998). 

Tips and questions 
 
Modern planning in the wake—if not exactly the mold—of the rational model 
has generally assumed a shared culture among participants that often does 
not exist—at least not at the outset of an effort to engage people in tackling a 
problem or charting a course together. The consequences can be huge, and 
yet often overlooked, in planning practice. 

Communication is a powerful window on this, which we came across first in 
the Arnstein reading about a “ladder of citizen participation,” in which Arnstein 
described different codes of talk in a fairly simple “government planners 
versus disadvantaged citizens” contrast. 

In each case reading above, as usual, don’t worry about the specialized terms. 
Focus instead on the core arguments about the role of communication and 
culture in planning, and pay special attention to the vignettes. 

1.  Tauxe’s analysis zeros in on public hearings, which we began to analyze 
in the “Towering Dilemma” case. She critiques an “invisible cultural 
selection process.” A simple way of thinking about this category of 
argument is this: Not everyone who speaks actually gets heard. What 
clash of cultures, interests, and rhetorical styles does Tauxe portray? 
How, if at all, do these clashes relate to the “power” of the respective 
parties, according to Tauxe? If you have ever organized or participated in 
a public hearing of any kind, think about the range of rhetorical styles and 
how these affected the framing and articulation of key stakeholder 
interests and of who had rhetorical or other “power” to influence 
decisions.

2.  What are communication “codes,” according to Briggs, what are “scripts,” 
and why is each important? 
3.  Think of a communication setting in which you have worked or in which 
you can see yourself working. Given the patterns outlined in these two 
ethnographic studies, what sorts of remedies or safeguards would you 
adopt?
