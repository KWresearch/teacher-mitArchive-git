Tips and questions 
 
In Session One, we used the Rebuild LA case as a window on some core 
themes and dilemmas facing planning, emphasizing Klosterman’s insight that 
it is one thing to have defensible ends (good things your field can help 
produce) and another to have legitimate, widely accepted means. 
 
We’ll revisit and re-analyze RLA in this session but also move beyond it, 
considering distinct traditions of planning as a way of understanding the field 
and its development. This sets up our first case assignment in Unit B (the 
next few weeks), focused on planning the recovery of New Orleans after 
Hurricane Katrina. It wasn’t necessary that our first two cases be about 
urban disaster recovery, but we can take advantage of that sequence in 
some ways. 
 
Questions for class prep and discussion sections: 
 
1.  Campbell and Fainstein suggest that it is premature to sound the 
“death knell” for approaches such as comprehensive planning. Why is that 
true if modernist planning, for which comprehensiveness was an early and 
core goal, has lost such legitimacy in the U.S. and other societies? And 
what’s wrong with the life-cycle model of planning, according to the 
authors? We will focus in class on the other two readings, but this one 
previews Units B and C by concisely outlining what’s worth reflecting on in 
order to become more effective, more ethical planners. 

2.  Sanyal’s concise and comparative planning history parallels Klosterman 
in many important respects—the fortunes of the rational or “modernist”

planning model, the importance of political shifts that challenge that 
model, etc.—but it is more comparative, and it includes an additional 
twenty years of historical developments. How does Sanyal suggest that 
we think or not think about “planning cultures”? What important 
influences have shaped planning in most parts of the world, and what 
kinds of changes seem more specific to particular regions or political 
systems? 

3.  Beauregard’s chapter directly sets the stage for our next unit of work, in 
which the complexity of multiple plans and the mistrust of various 
planning institutions play an important role. What role did the universities 
play after the Second World War, according to Beauregard, in the effort to 
establish planning as a field? And what are his conclusions, given the 
many changes that have reduced planning’s “totalizing vision” (meaning a 
tendency to want to plan for everything) and its “reformist tendencies” 
(meaning the urge to fix societal problems)? That is, what is his 
normative vision (pp.120-121) in view of all the changes?
