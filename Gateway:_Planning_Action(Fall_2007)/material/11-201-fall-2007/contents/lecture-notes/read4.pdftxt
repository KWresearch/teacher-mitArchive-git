Questions for class prep and discussion sections: 
 
1.  Why, according to Mandelbaum, do members of the public—and perhaps 
professional planners as well—need advice on “reading plans”? As for the 
modes of reading a plan, what are the “difficult choices” he identifies as 
part of the plan’s “policy claim”? Why does he consider some elements 
ambiguous and problematic when reading the “design opportunity”? In 
the third and final mode, what does it add to the reader’s understanding, 
according to Mandelbaum, to read a plan as a “narrative”? 

2.  Reading the Table of Contents of UNOP, what seems significant to you, if 
anything, about the topics and how they are presented? For example, are 
there explicit or implicit claims in them? What’s included in the contents 
and what’s missing, if anything, from your perspective? Is the sequence 
of the presentation notable in any way? 

3.  Considering now the UNOP Introduction, are there clear “policy claims” 
and “design opportunities”? Is there a storyline or narrative here as well, 
and if so, what is it?
