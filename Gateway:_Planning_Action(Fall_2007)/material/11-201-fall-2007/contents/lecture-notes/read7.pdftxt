Required reading: 
 
1.  RPT, Jane Jacobs, Introductory chapter from The Death and Life of 
Great American Cities (1961). 

2.  pp.121-171 only in Lawrence J. Vale, Reclaiming Public Housing 
(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2002).  Note that the 
earlier part of this chapter (pp. 37-121) covers some of the 
material introduced on October 1 and can be skimmed for 
background detail and historical context. 
 
Tips and questions 
 
In this session, we’ll carry forward the public housing cases discussed 
on October 1 and consciously examine the broader questions they 
raise about the dilemmas in planning, both past and present.  What 
happens to the ordered, rational city of “the experts” when public 
housing fails?  What alternatives are there for “reclaiming” public 
housing?  Who leads such efforts?  What does this tell us about the 
roles of planners? 
 
By the end of the 1970s, public housing projects in Boston (and 
nationally) had failed miserably—in both social and architectural terms. 
As in many cities, Boston’s poor suffered from industrial job loss, out-
migration of the middle class, and other changes.   Meanwhile, the 
patronage-riven Boston Housing Authority (BHA), charged with 
managing 13,000 public housing apartments, had become a 
completely dysfunctional organization and was placed under court-
ordered “receivership”—meaning that it was considered incapable of 
governing and operating itself—in 1980. 

During the receivership, the BHA launched several ambitious 
redevelopment efforts, including those at West Broadway (“D Street”) 
and Columbia Point (rebranded as “Harbor Point”).   These 
reinventions of public housing embraced several classic challenges to 
modernist rational planning prefigured in Jane Jacobs’ famous text.   
In contrast to the earlier top-down imposed modernist vision, the post-
utopian reality of efforts to remake public housing became caught up

in neighborhood-specific struggles over race and poverty; debates 
over the strengths and limits of physical design as a redevelopment 
tool for promoting social welfare; and conflicts over the roles of expert 
versus local knowledge—i.e., the aims and expectations of both expert 
professionals and the resident communities that needed to work 
together to make redevelopment successful.   

In the history of U.S. city planning, public housing can now be seen as 
a kind of double experiment.  The first experiment (from the 1930s 
through the 1970s) entailed replacement of older “slum” areas by 
modernist housing blocs; the second experiment (begun in the 1980s 
and still underway) has replaced many public housing “slums” with 
more traditional-looking architecture and urbanism (including so-called 
“new urbanist” designs).  In this context, Boston’s public housing 
transformations of the 1980s can be seen as harbingers of the national 
“HOPE VI” program, a $5 billion initiative launched by the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1992.  HOPE VI 
targets “severely distressed” public housing, and its planners and 
designers have imposed a new set of standards, both physical and 
social.   In what ways do these new versions of public housing still 
draw on the social reform tradition of planning? 

 
1.  The utopian proposals of Howard, Wright, and Le Corbusier, as 
outlined by Robert Fishman—together with the sweeping critique of 
utopian modernism offered by Jane Jacobs—bracket key dilemmas 
in 20th century thought about planning. Two of these classic 
dilemmas concern: the roles of professional vs. indigenous 
knowledge; and the power and limits of physical design solutions 
vs. social policy or other strategies. 

2.  Considering the case of West Broadway discussed in Vale, in 
retrospect, given the array of socio-economic challenges facing 
families in public housing, does it make sense that the vast majority 
of Boston Housing Authority (BHA) redevelopment funding went 
toward intervention in the realm of design?  Also, what kinds of 
practical knowledge (of the kind Jacobs celebrates) did public 
housing residents have that professional planners lacked? 
Conversely, what valuable technical knowledge did planners have 
that residents lacked but stood to benefit from?
