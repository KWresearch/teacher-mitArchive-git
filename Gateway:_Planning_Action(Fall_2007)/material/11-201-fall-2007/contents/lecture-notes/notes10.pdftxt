Planning needs some kind of mechanism for  
1)  developing a legitimate and popular mandate 
2)  Blending forms of useful knowledge (Local Metis Versus Rational Codified 
knowledge) 

 
We want planning to be a means of developing effective policy and implementation 
strategy. “Co-producing” is crucial. 
 
Towering Dilemma Case: 
How would you tackle this case as a planner? 
 
Questions asked in class: 
 
What was the dispute all about? 
How to approach decision making? 
How to assess success/failure of a resolution? 
 
Remember, you are not asking what the “right management plan” is. 
 
What was the institutional context for resolving this conflict?  Was this a regional 
management issue? 
Answer: The National Park Service was involved in this issue.  The plan involved 
management of a land resource.  The goal was to enhance the way they managed a 
resource: Land 
 
Deb Riggett was at the heart of creating this plan. 
 
The dispute was a distributional dispute because it involved distribution of the use of 
a land resource. 
1)  Native Americans believed the site to be sacred. 
2)  Climbers valued the site for recreational purposes 
3)  Environmentalists valued the land because of its rich ecosystem and wildlife.  
The site had nesting areas for raptors. 
4)  Professional climbing guides made a profit from the land. 

 
Indians conducted religious ceremonies during the month of June.  They were 
offended because climbers didn’t respect their beliefs.  They complained that 
climbers used offensive language which tainted the sacred nature of the site. 
 
Since government had to deal with the issue of religion, this case is not just an 
example of distributional problems, but also constitutional problems. 
 
There was a huge debate over whether the park was meant solely for recreational 
purposes, or if it was meant to be respected for its intrinsic value.  The park service 
was definitely a stakeholder in this case. 
 
Planning question: is there a template for working such issues out? 
 

There were cases in the past where religion has been at the center of a planning 
problem.  “Christian Worship Facilities” have been offered protection by the 
government, for example. 
 
Susskind argues that agencies enforce the law, but their ability to resolve conflict 
based on law is limited.  Often, efforts to resolve conflicts end in impasse.  Courts 
and judicial remedies are desirable, but they only evaluate conflicts based on their 
interpretation of the law (legal vs. illegal).  Government is essential, but institutions 
are inadequate.  They need consensus building tools by which all possible 
stakeholders are identified, information is made available to all, and the process of 
discussion is informal.   
 
Remember that consensus building tools supplement government institutions, they 
do not supplant them.  Government institutions are important to hold actors 
accountable.   
 
One of the reasons why conventional public hearings result in impasse is the use of 
“Advocacy Science”, where experts are “for hire”.  Opposing groups hire technical 
experts to project different interpretations for the same scientific information. 
 
Types of dispute: 
1) Conflicts over data (e.g. Facts on ground) 
 
For example, there were debates over the buffer area that raptors would 
need. 

Climbers turned to scientific information to make a point.   

 
Other examples: 
Is global warming caused by human activities? 
 
1) In order to avoid Advocacy Science, MIT and other institutions have developed a 
Joint Fact Finding Process.  Answers to questions will be determined jointly. 
2) Another approach to problem solving is the interest based approach.  The goal of 
this approach is to “make the pie bigger” rather than have a win-lose situation. 
3) Conflict over values should not be confused with conflicts over interests. 
 
For example, the Indians consider the rock to be sacred, and expect others to 
respect their values.  Climbers confused the values of Indians for interests when they 
asked the Indians to shift their ceremonies in June to winter. Note that individuals 
could strategically project their interests as values in order to get what they want.  
For example, the climbers claimed that they derived spiritual value from the 
mountain, whereas they probably had recreational interests. 
 
 
 
Lakota have many resolutions: 
1)  History: Wounded knee battle site, where many Native Americans were 
gunned down by settlers, under the idea that if you remove opposition from 
the Native Americans, only territory remains to be settled among themselves.  
Considering this history, it is important to acknowledge the difficulty in 
getting Native Americans to sit in a meeting and expecting them to hear 
others criticize their beliefs. 

 
What was Deb Riggett’s process in handling this situation?

She created a series of options and distributed this information to the people.  Based 
on comments from the people, future steps were taken. 
 
What is the role of public hearings in the planning process? 
Public hearings are part of institutional design.  They have strengths and 
weaknesses.  If the interaction in hearings is more like positional bargaining, 
opposing parties come with pre-formed ideas of what they want with a goal to get as 
much as they want.  Their demands are not flexible.  There is a facilitator, but 
usually, this type of bargaining is too structured and inflexible.  The person who 
chairs the meeting is not a facilitator.  There is limited time for each party to make 
their strongest point.  Often, it is government that chairs.  Such forms of interaction 
tend to polarize stances further, and place parties against each other.  Political 
bargaining involves compromise. 
 
Deb Riggett had to make a decision in limited time.  In political bargaining, it is the 
governmental agency that makes the final decision. 
 
There is skepticism about public hearings, and the extent to which the input of 
stakeholders is taken into account.  However, Susskind argues that public hearings 
can put new alternatives on the table which might not have been though of prior to 
the hearing.  In truth, most arguments tend to occur outside of the meeting. 
 
The mechanism to hold public meetings is not enough to look at all alternatives, 
because better organized groups can win arguments. 
 
Were the options provided in the draft viable options? 
 
We do not know of the process that led to the creation of those options.  But we can 
comment about the list.  The list had 2 extreme scenarios (no climbing at all versus 
no restriction on climbing).  In a way, this was effective because it led to a moderate 
middle. 
 
The issue of disparity of Power: 
 
Question: 
Is it always necessary to take history into account while attempting to resolve 
conflicts? 
 
The Park Service has decision making power in this situation.  From the point of view 
of the Native Americans, they are being told what to do on a piece of land that they 
think they are entitled to have because of their historical affiliation with the land. 
 
The general belief in class was that historical acts of injustice MUST be taken into 
account when we evaluate new dilemmas, not necessarily to correct historical 
wrongs, but to make them more open so that they are acknowledged.  Often, there 
is an outright denial of past offenses, which is not acceptable.  For example, the 
religious affiliation of the Native Americans to the tower was questioned. 
 
Not considering historical inequities is assuming that everyone is on a level playing 
field.  It denies that problems do exist, and leaving out these inequities makes it 
harder to reach a consensus.  It should be remembered that bringing out inequities 
should not be a manipulative strategy.  Mediators working on conflicts have said that 
sometimes, painful histories need to be dealt with.  From the point of view of

stakeholders, it is important to them that they be heard.  They want to be able to 
express their standpoint through narrative. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
How do we know if Consensus Building works? 
The C.B process can be evaluated: 
-  Based on stakeholders opinion about whether they were listened to or not. 
-  Based Sustainability of the relationship between parties after the process. 
-  Based on whether the outcome reflected interests versus positions
