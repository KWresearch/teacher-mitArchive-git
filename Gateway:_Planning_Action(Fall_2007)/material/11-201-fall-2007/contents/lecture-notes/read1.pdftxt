Tips and questions 
 
Each of these sheets is like the rudder on a supertanker: Small in scale but 
really important. We’ll use these sheets to provide “connective tissue” for the 
course, outlining the sequence of ideas and key debates on which we will 
focus in Gateway, punctuating important transitions between segments of 
the course, and in other ways illuminating why we’re doing the work we’re 
doing, step by step. Always read these tips and questions before doing the 
assigned reading for the session. 
 
We have two aims in the first few sessions of the course: Becoming a group 
that can learn effectively together, in both small settings (discussion 
sections) and large ones (class meetings and workshops); and scanning the 
origins and expectations of modern planning just enough to begin the team 
exercise—focused on New Orleans—in week two. 
 
We’ll do the “scanning” in broad terms at first, but we’ll try as much as 
possible to connect big ideas to practical dilemmas in the cases we use, 
starting right away in session one (we’ll use a video case in class, so there’s 
no case narrative to read for this particular session). 
 
Context for what you’ll read: You’ll note immediately that much writing about 
“planning” is focused on so-called Western planning, i.e. planning after the 
mid-19th century in Europe and North America, and to a lesser degree on 
planning in the former Soviet Bloc and the developing world. 
 
Complex systems of order and planning (broadly defined) obviously go back 
to ancient kingdoms and empires, such as the Roman and Persian Empires 
and beyond (Egypt, 2900 BC?), and China had large, elaborate systems of 
planned intervention—to build great cities and a Great Wall, as early as 214

BC—many centuries before Europe’s intellectual re-awakening a half 
millennium ago. This is something for us to talk about, and it’s something 
that Friedmann addresses thoughtfully in the excerpt we’ve assigned for this 
first session. For now, the important thing is that the most influential 
planning—for good or ill—is the form that developed and defined its role with 
the rise of the industrial city in Europe and North America—and also, though 
physical planners are not so aware of it, with the effort to efficiently fight two 
world wars. Understanding what’s influential is critical, though it’s very 
distinct from understanding all that is good or desirable or original. 
 
Read pp.1-7 of the syllabus carefully (on basic mechanics and schedule of 
the course) so you can identify any questions you want to ask, plus the 
“schedule at a glance” of course units, assignments, and such, and then the 
questions below, to go with the brief excerpt by Friedmann and the Readings 
in Planning Theory (hereafter, “RPT”) article by Klosterman listed above (you 
read the Klosterman piece as part of the “Reading critically” summer module 
online). 
 
For many sessions but not all, the Powerpoint slides we use in class will be 
available on the course website at least a day or two in advance, should you 
wish to print them out and bring them to class to help you take notes. 
 
Questions for class prep and discussion sections: 
 
1.  What historical and intellectual changes accompany the origins of 
modernist “rational” planning after the 18th century, according to 
Friedmann? Setting aside for the moment its many specific forms 
(economic planning, etc.), in what key ways does modernist planning 
differ from what he calls “orthogonal design,” which is a much more 
ancient practice? 

2.  Klosterman outlines the decline of modernist planning in some societies, 
and the erosion of its claims to legitimacy, following a golden age at mid-
20th century. (One could note, at this point, that such expert-led, top-
down planning is on the rise in other societies, especially where such 
planning is much newer and governments are very directive, such as in 
China and other parts of the developing world, but we will come back to 
that next week.) What are the key differences between economic and 
“pluralist” arguments about planning? Most importantly, what does 
Klosterman mean, toward the end, when he claims that planning retains 
justifiable claims about its ends—as meeting social needs—but not its 
means, i.e. no agreed-upon “procedural model for defining planning 
problems or justifying planning solutions”?
