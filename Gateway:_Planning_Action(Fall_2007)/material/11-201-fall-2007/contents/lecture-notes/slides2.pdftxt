Slide 1

Today’s learning objectives

1. Synthesize lessons of the RLA case: 
Move from theory to practice and back 
again.
2. Understand major chapters of modern 
planning history and risks of the “life-
cycle” interpretation of same, place 
historical developments in global 
perspective.
3. Create conceptual transition to team 
assignment (New Orleans recovery 
case) with preview of traditions.

Slide 2

The Rebuild L.A. context revisited

(cid:131) Crisis moment: high visibility and expectations, 
myriad problems, many views of them by diverse 
stakeholders, substantial opportunity to mobilize 
resources.
(cid:131) Spotlight: A highly entrepreneurial “partnership”
initiative with a focused (narrow) strategy.
(cid:131) Diagnosis: Exclusive approach (to defining problem 
and strategy) + muddled public expectations + weak 
public accountability > project focus > political 
attack > loss of legitimacy and support > 
restructuring … in spite of investment success.

Slide 3

Some strategic options for RLA

(cid:131) RE-POSITION: Redefine RLA role and its 
relationships to public, private, and 
nongovernmental sectors.
(cid:131) RE-ORIENT STRATEGY: Target major 
activities to businesses affected by riots; 
focus on recovery and growth; work 
closely with established organizations.
(cid:131) BUILD SUPPORT: Actively develop 
constituencies (take none for granted) 
that understand and support role.

Slide 4

The value of theory

(cid:131) Highlights the issue of what justifies 
planning’s ends and means (revealing 
cases as analogies, points of reference for 
planners everywhere).
(cid:131) Reminds us of the folly of a pure division of 
labor envisioned by “modernist” rational 
planning: The apolitical technocrats (smart 
analysts-designers), the politicians and 
publics.
(cid:131) Raises questions about whose values and 
norms are (actually) being served.
(cid:131) Provides multiple ways to assess the 
rightful role of the market vis-à-vis the 
state and civil society.

Slide 6

Planning history: Simple version

(cid:131) Cleaning up and ordering things: “Planning 
emerges as the 20th century response to the 19th
century industrial city” (Campbell and Fainstein, 
p.5).
(cid:131) One-way global: Planning invented in the West 
and transferred to (forced on?) “the Rest.”
(cid:131) Life cycle: Modernist technical capability 
celebrated, then reviled, then overthrown in 
favor of “bottom-up planning” and planning-as-
process-management (not expert design and 
choice).

Slide 7

Problems with the simple version

(cid:131) The “industrial city” story covers the development of city 
planning better than planning generally. Much planning is 
non-local, non-physical.
(cid:131) Different societies = different trajectories and “cultures”
(norms + institutions) that define planning’s legitimate 
role, scope, practices.
(cid:131) A given approach, such as “modernist rational planning”
by trained planners, can be employed long after it comes 
under attack. It may be well institutionalized + preferred to 
alternatives.
(cid:131) Multiple approaches to planning (and its justification) can 
co-exist in practice—even in a single field in a single city.
(cid:131) The academy is not the world of practice: Intellectual 
debate vs. planning practice and practice of politics.

Slide 8

More on global influence

(cid:131) Promotion and institutionalization across 
borders: Colonialism, post-war “development”
ideology, models tied to money (aid agencies).
(cid:131) “Marketization” and neo-liberalism trends in 
affluent nations: Reagan-Thatcher “government 
is problem” vs. Blair-Clinton “third way.”
(cid:131) But if planning is more than technical, 
modernist science applied to human affairs and 
the physical environment, then practices can (a) 
evolve locally regardless of outside influence 
(“indigenous”); and (b) be transferred in 
multiple directions, across borders.

Slide 9

Considering alternative definitions

(cid:131) Friedmann: Planning as “The effort to 
guide history with reason”
(cid:131) Distinctively post European Enlightenment, not 
orthogonal design, emphasis on the rationally 
trained.
(cid:131) Baum: Planning as “Organizing hope 
about the future”
(cid:131) More timeless, universal, and open-ended as to 
what constitutes “organizing” and “hope”—not to 
mention who can organize and define hope and 
alternative futures legitimately.

Slide 11

The DESIGN tradition

(cid:131) Outgrowth of architecture and engineering
mainly.
(cid:131) Debates over forms of “urbanism” (how 
people experience cities, beauty, culture).
(cid:131) Plus physical requirements of structuring 
the environment to make it healthy, 
sustainable, cost effective.

Slide 12

The EMPOWERMENT tradition

(cid:131) Rooted in political economy (assessing 
who gets and who loses, how power is 
amassed and exercised, how role and use 
of capital shapes society).
(cid:131) Debates over role of historical inequalities 
today, hopes for transformation (not just 
“order”).
(cid:131) Planning as a fundamentally political 
practice with technical tools.
(cid:131) Multiple philosophies and modes of 
practice, limited consensus.

Slide 13

The POLICY ANALYSIS tradition

(cid:131) Outgrowth of economics, operations research, 
organizational science.
(cid:131) Concern for optimal decision, “maximizing welfare”
under constraints, value-neutral mechanics of choice.
(cid:131) Specific steps (decision cycle):
1. Define goals and objectives (values supplied to analyst)
2.
Identify options (alternative courses of action)
3. Predict consequences (deal with risk and uncertainty)
4. Evaluate options according to objectives and criteria
5. Decide
6.
Implement
7. Generate feedback > Redefine goals and objectives

Slide 14

New Orleans case preview

(cid:131) Who is authorized—formally or 
informally—to plan? For whom?
(cid:131) What defines the good city? For whom?
(cid:131) How should plans address political, as 
opposed to technical, problems?
(cid:131) What defines success: Political viability, 
technical defensibility, other?
