Lecture 1: Course Introduction 
 

I. Overview 
 
Today is a discussion about what planning means for planners and for you.  
We’ll begin covering some tools.  However, everyone in class has different starting 
points from their experiences with planning.  That is why we will start by talking in 
broad terms. 
 

II. Slide Presentation 
 
Why is the makeup of communities changing so fast today?  We’ll discuss 
what is driving demographic change.  Slide 1 sets the agenda for today’s discussion 
about population change and the Sydney case described by Sandercock. 
Boston is historically interested with the history of racial conflict because the 
city experienced an Irish and Italian migration.  Recent racial conflicts in Boston 
include the required desegregation of public schools using busing. 
What does diversity have to do with planning?  There is different emphasis in 
different places you work.  Tolerance is a “minimal aspiration” but isn’t necessarily 
an interest in another person’s history.  Tolerance is not active and it is not robust.  
Fusion is a mix of new groups within a city; it is not talked about in today’s readings. 
The UK Commission on Racial Quality has several specialist areas including 
Britishness.  The commission asks ‘what does it mean to be a modern Brit?’  
Additional specialist areas include integration, cohesion, equality, public services, 
citizenship, and identity.  The motto of the organization includes, ‘we work for just 
and integrated society.” 
Slide 3 distinguished between diversity as a matter of population make up 
(meaning the composition of project team, organization, neighborhood, etc) and 
expectations about how diversity will be handled.  The past 40-50 years we have 
brought a revolution that is still underway.  The 1960’s were changing era that 
criticized modern-rationalist thought and brought about different ways of telling 
stories. 
Population shifts with migration in to a place (+), the birth and death rate 
(+,-), and the migration rate out.  Basic US demography is different than Japan, 
where there is no in migration and few out migration.  Birth rates are down in OECD 
nations – in the last generation, the birth rates are falling in countries that used to 
have high birth rates.  Japan is one of the smallest.  This has implications for politics, 
economics, and pension reform.  The trend of nations falling below replacement is 
tied to an increase in education. 
Three population pyramids:  fast growing country with short life expectancy, 
the US, and no growth (looks like a rectangle).  Age structure shapes have 
economic, crime, and political implications.  The US age pyramid has a bulge – that’s 
the baby boomers.  What does that mean for social security?  What is the racial 
make up of the pyramid?  The oldest has more whites, the middle and bottom of the 
pyramid is increasingly non-white (immigration).  Migration is the second major 
driver of shifting make up.  Second major wave of immigration is non-European 
unlike the first wave. 

Other OECD nations have much higher foreign born percentages:  Australia: 
25%, US: 12.6%, and Japan 1.5%.  The US has a birth rate that his high and near 
replacement and high in migration.  Japan has a low birth rate below replacement 
and a low in migration.  Cuba has a low birth rate below replacement, and a very 
low, regulated in migration. 
Economic implications include who makes up the workforce and who will be 
consumers.  Also who will pay in to the social security system thirty years from now 
so that today’s workers can withdraw?  Social security is the most impactful 
American policy because it affected poverty, etc. 
Identity – what does it mean to be native?  There is a genealogy project that 
uses DNA to learn about a person’s deep roots.  It traces mitochondria in DNA since 
migrations out of Africa.  People do not think of identities this way – which we all 
came out of African migrations. 
There are four kinds of American identity:  indigenous, settlers, slaves, and 
immigrants.  For the first time in 2000, the census allowed you to pick more than 1 
ethnic box. 
Two models of assimilation or convergence are included in the slides.  The 
assimilation model includes fixed boundaries, where newcomers and natives move 
in.  An example is the 17th century British view that Germans look different than 
them.  The convergence model has more fluid boundaries where mainstream shifts 
as groups cross boundaries or not. 
 

III. Australian Case 
 
 
Sandercock’s first four challenges included “planning as a weapon.”  That is 
when planning in some places is negative, such as the clean up before the Olympics. 
How does the built environment demonstrate planning ideals?  The slides 
presented images from the Estates of Princeton housing development.  The slogan 
for the development is, “the new New Jersey.”  The street names and marketing 
language are from the British class system.  Similar developments are being created 
in China and India.  Here, affluence is tied with the allusion to British wealth, for 
example the homes were called carriage houses. 
Place names reflect cultural attitudes.  The US uses pastoral and woodland 
names often.  Cambridge squares (not streets) are named after immigrants, for 
example O’Donnell Square. 
Sandercock promotes dialogue, including “therapeutic” process.  We are 
paying more attention to people’s stories.  Most people learn through stories.  Also, 
stories can easily manipulate.  An example of stories is Harry Spence inviting 
stakeholder input for a charter in Chelsea.  The charter included people’s stories 
about living in Chelsea for over 100 years.  Including stories helped build trust in the 
public institution and create a just charter. 
In the Sydney case, it is the story of a disposition of a factory site in a city 
that has been rezoned for community use.  This creates the potential for planning.  
There was one party who wanted a park.  There was one party who opposed and 
instead supported an aboriginal reconciliation site.  And the last party was made up 
of aboriginal groups who also opposed the park.  The mediator approached the 
conflict by holding separate meetings with the three groups.  Then, the mediator 
brought them all together for a speak out session.  The identity of the groups was 
very different. 
The mediator’s process design included the planner gathering information and 
listening to all groups.  However, the mediator does not explain how she prepared 
the different groups for participating in the speak out session.

During the speak out session, the groups came together in an agreement in 
principle and an agreement in terms.  The agreement in principle was followed by 
community planning on constraints, budgets, analyses, etc.  You do not want to start 
with an agreement in terms because terms can be very divisive.  Principles unite, 
terms divide.  For example, international agreements begin with principles. 
How was the mediator’s work done? 
(cid:131)  Strategy and tactical tool kit 
(cid:131)  Skills 
(cid:131)  Roles (planner as process designer) 
(cid:131)  Legitimate communication 
The communication refers to the emphasis the mediator placed on therapy.  
Here, therapy was an emotion and there is validity in planning for emotions.  They 
can be crucial and vital in transforming changes. 
Was the project successful?  The one sided perspective of the mediator helps 
us ask this question.  However, answers can depend on when the question is asked 
(5 months versus 5 years). 
The point of this case is for us to become a better strategist to decide with 
process or toolkit is best to use when planning.  You could use this exact approach in 
every situation.
