Planning from “above” versus 
planning from “below”—November 5th

 
From Prof. Rajagopal: 

The Narmada dam projects began as classic “modernist” rational planning by 
government to define and address energy needs in the context of large-scale 
economic development. 

The dams were conceived and vigorously promoted in the 1950s and began 
to be implemented in the 1970s in the western part of India, along one of the 
country’s longest rivers. The project—consisting of 30 major, 135 medium-
sized and almost 3,000 small dams stretching across three Indian states in 
the Narmada valley—was one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the 
world. 

From its inception, the project ran into trouble at various levels but most 
intensely from the people living in the Valley who organized an 
unprecedented national and international campaign to obtain better terms for 
resettlement and even stop some elements of the project.  The oppositional 
campaign has been described as a watershed in world development and 
transnational politics. Despite this opposition, however, the construction of 
the dams has proceeded, albeit slower than planned, resulting in the forced 
displacement of thousands of tribal people and farmers, as well as the 
flooding of ecologically sensitive areas. 

The violence of these development projects has overwhelmingly affected a 
variety of socio-economically weaker classes, especially belonging to 
historically marginalized caste groups. More than 57% of the people 
displaced due to Sardar Sarovar dam alone are tribal people (India avoids 
terms such as “indigenous” or “native”). If we include the landless laborers, 
fisherpeople, and others who are not officially counted as “project affected,” 
the share of displaced people who are from the lowest strata of Indian 
society may be over 80%. 

Through this case, we want to address several related questions: What is the 
relationship between planners and the intended beneficiaries and victims of 
the projects?  What is the relationship between planning and the overall 
project of ‘development’ as a global, national, and local concern? How should 
major third parties—such as the World Bank and other multilateral agents—
relate to governments and to civil society groups? How should planning “from 
above,” typically by government authorities and their partners, relate to 
planning “from below,” for example by social movement participants?

Tips and questions 
 
a.  As we’ve seen again and again in the course, since “planning” is defined 
in many ways by both its critics and its fans, it’s important to pay close 
attention to how a particular argument about planning defines the term 
and why. How and why does Escobar make a case for a “post-
development” perspective on social change in developing countries? And 
why exactly does he want “planning”—at least in the limited, modernist 
rational sense of the term, if not the more adaptive and broad sense we 
have been exploring—to “fade away from concern”? 

b.  Based on the required readings, including Roy’s sharp critique and 
Khagram’s as well, how should societies define “development” and 
“planning”? In light of Rajagopal’s arguments, how should the Narmada 
dam projects’ disparate and severe impacts on particular groups be 
weighed in those definitions of progress and the legitimate mechanisms 
for producing it? 

Note: We will screen “Drowned Out,” a powerful documentary film about 
Narmada, this week, and we also plan to stream it to the course video 
webpage.
