Tips and questions 
 
Sticking with the Curitiba context and history to ground our discussion, we’re 
going to focus this session on two powerful arguments for people-led 
planning and on the implications of those arguments. 
 
The first argument is explicitly a call for “citizen power” atop a hierarchy 
(ladder) of citizen participation in decisionmaking. The ladder was developed 
by Sherry Arnstein in response to U.S. government-mandated participation in 
community development programs in the late 1960s. It’s important to 
understand that that was her context, which were not unlike a newer 
generation of mandated participation schemes in developing countries, such 
as the World Bank’s “community-driven development” model (see, for 
example, Cooke and Kothari, editors, Participation: The New Tyranny?, Zed 
Books, 2001). This Arnstein article is the most cited work in the English 
language on the subject of citizen participation in planning and 
decisionmaking. 
 
The second argument for people-led planning is more indirect. It is an 
elaboration of the concept of “local knowledge” or what James Scott, turning 
to Greek, calls mētis. It is knowledge born of experience and centered on 
particulars, not scientifically derived generalities divorced from lived 
experience and insight. The background to the excerpt you will read is Scott’s 
very thoughtful and interesting critique of the history of modernism and its

authoritative claim to “order” society, which is modern planning’s ancestry. 
But you’ve read some of that critique in other sources, at least in broad 
terms, so we’ve left the background on the “recommended” list above. 
 
Now, let’s construct a scenario, within the Curitiba case, to which we can 
apply the important ideas in the Arnstein and Scott readings. Imagine that 
you’re working for the Curitiba city government as a planner and that you’ve 
been assigned to develop and implement a plan for a new neighborhood. At 
the mayor’s request, following a meeting with landless people and property 
owners, the plan will be organized around low-cost housing, safe play areas 
for children, and the need for neighborhood residents to pursue livelihoods in 
the city. These are the landless who have “invaded” public and private 
property in Curitiba, as they have done in many other cities in the developing 
world where decent, affordable housing in economically healthy places is 
scarce or non-existent. For simplicity, let’s say that government has 
purchased a large site from a private property owner, taking her financial 
interest out of the picture. There a range of other interests. The city planning 
department has some priorities for the area which include environmental 
sustainability, avoiding over-crowding, and protecting the rights of abutting 
property owners. But you’re convinced that there’s a way to plan and 
develop a community with landless people so as to create sustainability in a 
wider sense—solutions that are more sensible and that are widely perceived 
as politically legitimate. There’s a design opportunity here, to be sure, but it’s 
a tricky political context, given the conflicts, too. 
 
1.  In Arnstein’s model, how is “citizen power” distinguished from the lower 
rungs of the ladder, and what justifies the pursuit of participation at that 
level, according to Arnstein? What limits of the model does she identify, 
and can you think of others? Which of the limits might be relevant to your 
Curitiba planning challenge and why? 

2.  Scott warns that “any formula that excludes or suppresses the 
experience, knowledge, and adaptability of mētis risks incoherence and 
failure” (p.319). He detailed this argument in a lecture at the World Bank 
recently, with “lively” results. Scott’s main focus is on why and how what 
“ordinary” people know is essential for problem-solving, not on citizens’ 
rights to influence decisionmaking. But he knows well that power is 
implicated in this equation. What kinds of local knowledge might be 
important for the plan you need to create and implement in Curitiba? Who 
holds that knowledge, and how might it be tapped?
