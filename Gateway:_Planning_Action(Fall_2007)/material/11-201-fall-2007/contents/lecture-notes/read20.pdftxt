Tips and questions 
 
As we have seen, modern planning evolved after the 19th century along a difficult 
path that often seemed to pit expertise against popular opinion, politics against 
rational choices. In a world of changing expectations, what does it take to envision 
and pursue choices that are not just popular but also wise? 

This week, we go beyond the near obsession with “participation” in planning to 
explore a broader idea: Planning as part of the effort to build and use “civic 
capacity” to tackle significant challenges in the world in ways that can really make a 
difference. 

For this session, we’ll use two chapters on the “millennial” challenge of managing 
urban growth, from a book I’ve written about this civic capacity approach. One 
chapter is a case set in the U.S. In the next session, we’ll discuss the second case 
in this pair, set in India. 

1.  The first chapter argues that managing growth cannot be done effectively simply 
by making better public policy, including better formal plans for growth: Why? 
And what does considering learning alongside bargaining add to our 
understanding of planning’s role in creating a better world? 

2.  (Case chapter) Some advocates of the visioning done by Envision Utah tout its 
public meetings as the secret to its success. What does that view miss about 
how the organization approached the growth problem and possible solutions at 
the visioning phase of its work? And what important changes in role and 
strategy took place after that stage? 

3.  How should the success or shortcomings of an effort like this one be judged?
