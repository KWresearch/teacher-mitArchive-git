Reading Tips and Study Questions: For Session 24 
Planning Observation Debrief—December 12th

 
 
Required reading (part of the memo assignment) 
 
Judith Innes and David Booher, “Reframing Public Participation: 
Strategies for the 21st Century,” Planning Theory 5(4), 419-436 (2004). 
 
 
Tips and questions 
 
1.  What, if anything, surprised you about the planning meeting you 
attended? 

2.  Do the “findings” in your memo corroborate or challenge any of Innes 
and Booher’s arguments about public participation? If so, how? 

3.  Now think about their recommendations—alternative practice framework, 
creating forums and arenas, etc.—from the perspective of the fields 
within, or approaches to planning, that particularly interest you. Is their 
agenda of change the right one? Why or why not?
