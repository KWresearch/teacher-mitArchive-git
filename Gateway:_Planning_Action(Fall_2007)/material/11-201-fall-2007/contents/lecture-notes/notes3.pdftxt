I.  Presentation by Professor Frank Levy 

     Economic Redevelopment of New Orleans: 
 

Regional Thinking 
Key considerations: 
• 
Is this region self-sufficient? 
•  What factors create a region, what does the region import and export? 
•  What are the benefits of density? 

o  Fishing 
o  Ship building 
o  A “marketplace” of related service sectors 
 
Understanding Density – Why are rents higher in cities? 
•  Proximity Benefits – more population utilizing other services creates business 
•  Able to make more money 
•  Core industries require augmentation 
•  Concentrations create value – growth begets growth 
•  Density value, however, is highly unstable 

 

Hurricane Katrina destroys not just physical structures of New Orleans, but 
economy 
•  Tourism and gambling collapse 
•  Ship building exports were weakened, few other industrial industries 
•  Exacerbated the historically sharp shift in labor market: 
(cid:131)  Exodus of manufacturing 
(cid:131)  Residents which do not match up with needed labor force 

 
Rebuilding New Orleans’s exports: 
•  Co-Priming – force spending within economy (eg: New 
Deal) 
•  Create conditions to attract density 

 

II.  Institutions  - The Plan for New Orleans 
 

Traditional planning bodies  
•  Narrow scope 
•  Limited capacity 
•  Limited credibility 
 
New Orleans Rebuilding Audiences 
•  Local 
•  State 
•  National  
• 
International 

 
Mayor Nagin dismisses existing city Planning Commission 
•  Creates Bring New Orleans Back (‘BNOB’) 
•  Calls in Urban Land Institute (‘ULI’) 
o 
“non-partisan” 
o  not-for-profit 
 
BNOB must create plan quickly 
•  Respond to pressing local needs 
•  Fit FEMA’s timeframe 
•  Respond to national demands (President called for a plan) 
•  Pending local elections 
 
BNOB exists with 
• 
Informal authority 
•  Some politically legitimacy 
•  Has the opportunity to set agenda, set limited terms of rebuilding 
•  Power to define problems and create strategies 
YET, BNOB 

(cid:131)  Has no formal authority 
(cid:131)  Has no funding stream 

 
 
 
 
 
Like RLA, BNOB could define problems narrowly, and devise strategies based on 
sources of influence. 
 
ULI Recommendations to BNOB: 
1.  Stage Redevelopments  
-  Created Zones (including the “green dots”) 
-  Rebuilding moratorium (in non-priority zones) 
2.  Resettle and Relocate 
3.  Provision of Basic Services 
• 
Improve government efficacy 
•  Service delivery 
•  Rebuild economy 
4.  Create a Recovery Authority as a neural administrator 
•  Control Flow of $ 
•  Utilize powers of Eminent Domain 
•  Coordinate financing (float bonds, etc) 
•  Advocate
