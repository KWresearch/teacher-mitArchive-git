Tips and questions 
 
In the first two sessions, we used a condensed history of modern planning to 
highlight planning’s role and legitimacy. But in this history, we also 
overviewed some of the substantive tasks planners have had: making cities 
more functional and beautiful, spurring job growth, fighting poverty, and 
more. The next two weeks will give us the chance to learn about an 
important ongoing case of tackling major tasks through specific plans to help 
a major city recover from natural disaster—and, some would say, from a 
variety of man-made disasters as well.  
 
This first session of Unit B introduces New Orleans, its politics, the events 
surrounding Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (including relief details), and then the 
recovery planning efforts that followed. We don’t expect you to commit all 
the details to memory. But this prepares us to examine New Orleans plans 
next week and hear from knowledgeable insiders about the status of plans 
and planning efforts in New Orleans as well as the big questions ahead for 
the city. 
 
Disaster experts typically distinguish two phases: relief action (which meets 
immediate needs of the victims, such as for clean water, food, and shelter);

and recovery and reconstruction, which restores the longer-term bases of 
people’s lives, from economic livelihoods to housing to valued cultural 
heritage and more. Our work will focus on planning in the second phase. 
 
Finally, please sit in your team groupings when you come to class for this 
session (see Q3 below). 
 
Questions for class prep and discussion sections: 
 
1.  Why, according to Vale and Campanella, are modern cities so resilient? 
Why do they “rise again” after disasters across the world? In light of the 
historical material we covered in the last session, what important 
questions for planning (generally) are captured in their brief commentary 
on “Assessing recovery” after disasters? 

2.  In the Plans versus Politics case, should the city government have 
backed the “rational” ULI “green-dot” strategy? Why or why not? What 
new challenges appeared after the rejection of that plan, that is, when 
many different players in the city planned recovery? (Note that the United 
New Orleans Plan will be an important focus for us next week.) 

3.  Lastly, read the Tools for Teams, created by researchers and educators 
at the MIT Leadership Center. We won’t collect your “cognitive style” self-
assessment, so just use it to spark some reflection about your style. We’ll 
make time in this assignment kick-off session for you to gather as a team 
and start with basic questions, such as “What do your team members 
need to know about you in order to work effectively with you?” and “How 
do we want to organize deadlines leading up to the dry run?” and “How 
might we want to divide the labor?” plus the all-important “When do we 
meet next?!?” 

On the further reading: 

4.  Brinkley’s Vanity Fair article offers exceptional detail on the days right 
before and after the storm. And it is not flattering to New Orleans Mayor 
Ray Nagin. Who backed his entry into office, and what key political 
considerations shaped his actions in the wake of the storm, according to 
Brinkley? What other political players, at several levels of government, 
does Brinkley spotlight as important to the events in New Orleans?
