Required reading 
 
1.  (Case) Briggs, “The Grassroots-to-Grasstops Dynamic: Slum Redevelopment 
and Accountability in Mumbai,” chapter 5 in Democracy as Problem-Solving: 
Civic Capacity in Communities across the Globe, Forthcoming, MIT Press, 2008. 

Further reading (optional) 

2.  Briggs, “Conclusion,” chapter 12 in [same as above]. Outlines and discusses the 
six major lessons of the four-nation study, plus democracy: how should it work?  

 
Tips and questions 

1.  Diagnosing the context. Mumbai is a changing global city with a variety of large-
scale development challenges. Why do slumdwellers have political leverage in 
this context? That is, what are the specific sources of that leverage? And how 
does partnering give people at the “grassroots” the chance to shape outcomes 
with those at the “grasstops” (authority figures and other influentials) beyond 
“citizen participation” to make requests of public officials? 

2.  Thinking about the role of organizations—which are overlooked in much 
“planning” literature—in improving planning and getting things done. Implicit in 
the case are a wide variety of roles for professional planners: from designing 
housing and neighborhoods to financing real estate development deals, spurring 
organizational learning across agencies and along international (or 
“transnational”) networks, analyzing and reforming public policy (including 
regulations and subsidy programs), and more. But these functions are carried 
out within and across organizations that have come to play distinct roles in 
urban development in Mumbai (the case focuses on slum redevelopment as a 
specific category of development). What are those organizational roles, 
according to the chapter, and how did they evolve through specific projects?
