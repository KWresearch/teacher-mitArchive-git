Slide 1

Big questions

Using Fainstein:
(cid:131) What should be done about cities, 
regions, society? And how: What role for 
planning?
(cid:131) What should planners do?
(cid:131) Advocate and empower?
(cid:131) Sell a vision and “give form”?
(cid:131) Facilitate/mediate among interests and “styles”?
(cid:131) Just analyze and report back? Etc….

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 2

Learning from cases

(cid:131) Creating analogies: 
probably the most 
powerful way human 
beings learn.
(cid:131) Recognizing 
patterns—what does 
this look like that I’ve 
seen before?—and 
adapting to new 
situations.
(cid:131) Key: Appropriate 
simplification.
GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 3

Examples of analogizing thru cases

(cid:131) Compare Rebuild L.A. to Narmada as cases of 
“legitimacy failure” in planning.
(cid:131) Compare RLA to Unified New Orleans Planning
as cases of weak or absent government, crisis-
driven political opportunity.
(cid:131) Compare New Orleans to Narmada and Kelo as 
cases in the ethics of takings and displacement.
(cid:131) Compare Boston public housing redevelopment
to Mumbai slum redevelopment as cases of 
tapping “local knowledge” while building political 
power to shape outcomes.
(cid:131) Assessing your own “live cases” (planning 
meetings) in light of the other cases, e.g. clash-of-
styles transportation planning case.

Slide 5

The first “school” of modern planning

(cid:131) Rigid, functional division of labor: “theoretician-
planners” and administrators vs. everyone else.
(cid:131) Politics as “inconsequential,” not a “guiding 
force”—trumped by immutable scientific laws, 
rigid notion of rationality.
(cid:131) Addressed to “the rulers of society.”
(cid:131) Focused on professionalization (city planning, 
military planning, education, business 
management, social work, public health).
(cid:131) This is the origin and orientation of modernist
planning: technocratic, self-assured, but also 
systematic in key ways.

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 6

But in reality …

(cid:131) Fuzzy division of labor, overlapping expertise, 
uncertainty and miscommunication common.
(cid:131) Science an incomplete guide, values are broad and 
often conflict.
(cid:131) Faith in government waxes and wanes—in most 
societies.
(cid:131) Planners must build support for their ideas, 
participate in the political process to identify target 
problems, generate options and criteria, implement.
(cid:131) Many government planners merely “permit”
(cid:131) Many plans sit on shelves: Ideas without constituents.
(cid:131) Much planning not done by the state.

Slide 7

Some responses

(cid:131) To political fallacies: embed planning in democratic 
interest-group competition (Altshuler), use plural plans 
to generate more alternatives and more equal 
representation of interests (Davidoff), strengthen 
mechanisms for resolving conflicts and building 
consensus (Susskind and Cruikshank, Innes and 
Gruber), devolve authority (Arnstein), develop a force 
for broader social change linked to practical 
mechanisms for producing more just outcomes 
(Fainstein).
(cid:131) To knowledge conflicts and communication failures:
focus on critical listening (Forester), create conditions 
for dialogue (Healey), recognize and tap local 
knowledge (Scott).
(cid:131) To a dominant culture of planning: Uncover marginalized 
cultures and their stories, develop multicultural 
competencies (Sandercock, Others).

Some targets for learning

KNOW (content-area knowledge, e.g. 
environmental science, the history of race, 
ethical frameworks)
DO (competencies: consciously learned skills, e.g. 
statistical or financial analysis, drafting, 
interviewing stakeholders)
BE (mostly unconscious—but developable—
competencies, e.g. “personal effectiveness”: 
emotional intelligence, balancing assertiveness 
and deference, persuasiveness and self-
criticism)
