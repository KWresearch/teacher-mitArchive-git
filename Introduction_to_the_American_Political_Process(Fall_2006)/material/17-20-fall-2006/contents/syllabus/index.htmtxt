***** Course Description *****
This course provides students with an introduction to the basic institutions of
American government, especially as established in the constitution, and with an
introduction to currents of thought among social scientists about the workings
of U.S. politics. This is a communication intensive course. As such you are
required to write at least 20 pages - that's the C.I. requirement - and
participate in class discussions.

Write one short paper on the readings for one of the weeks. Please choose one
of the weeks during the first week of class.
This paper is due Tuesday morning, 10 a.m., of the week about which the paper
is written. The paper should engage what you feel to be an interesting
political question raised in the readings. The paper should be 3 to 4 pages
long, double spaced, 12 points, 1 inch margins. Send the paper to me and to all
other students in the class electronically. I will use these to open
conversation about the week's topic. During your week I expect you to help lead
discussion. The paper will be graded on your writing and analysis and your
participation during that week.
**** Observation Paper ****
The paper should be 3 to 4 pages long and on a topic related to your term
paper. Please submit your paper by the end of Week 7.
**** Term Paper ****
A 15-page research paper that builds off the observation paper on one of the
topics distributed in class. I expect you to choose a topic and inform your TA
by the end of Week #6. You will work in recitation on how to research and write
your paper. You are required to submit a paper outline by end of Week #8 and a
rough draft by the end of Week #10. We will give you comments on your draft so
that you can rewrite the paper and turn it in by the end of Week #14.
