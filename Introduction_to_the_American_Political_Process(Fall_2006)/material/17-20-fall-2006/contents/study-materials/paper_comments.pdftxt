General Paper Comments 

Below are some paper-writing suggestions based on the rough drafts I graded:  

* Strive for strong opening and concluding paragraphs that clearly state your thesis/argument. 
Try to grab the reader's attention and explain why she should care about your topic. Aim for 
specificity in stating your main point, and make sure it's an argument/thesis and not just a 
description. Work with the writing tutor on developing an argument. She is available six hours 
per week. 

* Use subheadings to guide the reader through longer papers. 

* Watch your verb tenses. Use the same verb tense consistently throughout the paper. (Past tense 
is usually best for events like elections and policy developments.) 

* Tighten every sentence and cut out all unnecessary words. Use active not passive verbs. 

* Break up long paragraphs by topic, and flesh out paragraphs with less than three sentences. 
Make sure each paragraph completes a point/subpoint that supports your argument/thesis. 

* For those students researching a congressional race and a policy issue, don't introduce your 
policy issue too late in the paper. Integrate the policy issue up front with your analysis of the 
campaign. 

* Cite class readings and lecture notes to bolster your analysis. 

* Use a proper citation format in your bibliography (e.g. APA). (For a paper with lots of websites 
and newspaper cites rather than scholarly articles or books, footnotes usually work better than in-
text citations.) 

Good luck!
