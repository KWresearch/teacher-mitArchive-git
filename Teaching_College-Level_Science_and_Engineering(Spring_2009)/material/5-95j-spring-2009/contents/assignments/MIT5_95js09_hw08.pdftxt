Homework 8 

Due  in  class  on  Tuesday,  12   May  2009. 

This assignment is designed to help you integrate and apply all the ideas from the semester. 

1.  Your question 
Reﬂect on the whole course, on any teaching experiences you had (as a student or a teacher), 
or on your experience doing the next problem – and think of one question about teaching that 
you still wonder about. 
Bring the question with you to lecture (no need to turn it in).  Your questions will be the basis 
for the ﬁnal session (summary and Q&A). 

2.  Final assignment:  reﬂective memo 
Write a short memo (say, 2 or 3 pages) on how you would teach a one-semester or one-quarter 
course  on  ‘Teaching College-Level  Science  and  Engineering’.  Imagine  that  your  department 
head  has  asked  you  to  teach  it,  and  gives  you  carte  blanche  to  design  and  teach  it  how  you 
think best. 
What  are  the most  important  ideas  in  the  subject?  What  goals  would  you  have  for  the  stu­
dents? What topics would include? How would you structure classroom time, projects, home-
works, practical sessions – or whatever you think most appropriate? Explain your choices. 
Turn in your memo in lecture on 12 May.
