Homework 3 

Due  in  class  on  Tuesday,  17   March  2009. 

Here are questions to work on and readings for Lecture 5 (March 17). The only item to bring in is 
your writeup for Problem 3, so that you can trade it with a colleague. 

1.	 Readings  on  course   design  

This week's readings are related to course design - the topic of the upcoming lecture:

a.	 ‘The Eric experiment’ from Sheila Tobias (1990), They’re Not  Dumb,  They’re Different:  Stalking 
the   Second Tier, Research Corporation, Tucson, Arizona. 

b.	 R. David Middlebrook,  ‘Methods  of  design-oriented  analysis:  Low-entropy  expressions’, 
New  Approaches  to  Undergraduate  Education  IV, Santa Barbara, 26–31 July 1992. 

c.	 Selection from Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe (2005), Understanding by  Design, ASCD. 
Skim them, then choose your favorite to read more carefully; feel free to choose more than one 
if you are inspired. Write a question about the reading for yourself (no need to turn it in). 

2.	 Practice   with  Bloom’s  taxonomy 
Where on Bloom’s taxonomy would you categorize the following problems?  There  is no one 
right answer, but making the categorizations will give you practice using Bloom’s taxonomy. 

a.	 [for  an  intro calculus  course]   Construct a function f(x) with all of these characteristics:  f(0) = 
0; f(x) ≈  |x| as |x| → ∞; and f(x) ≈ x2  as |x| → 0.  Sketch f(x) by hand (e.g.  without using 
a graphing calculator). 

b.	 [for  an   introductory  calculus  course]  Sketch  f(x) =  ln  cosh x  by hand  (e.g.  without using  a 
graphing calculator). 

c.	 [for  an  introductory  calculus  course]  Graph f(x) =  ln  cosh x  using a graphing calculator. 

d.	 [for  a  comprehensive   exam  at   the  end   of  a  physics  undergraduate  degree]  In the special-relativity 
course, you learnt that the speed of light is always c  in any reference frame, no matter what. 
In the electrodynamics course, you learnt that the speed of light in matter is v  =  c/n, where 
n  is the index of refraction. Can these two statements be reconciled? 

e.	 [for  a  freshman-physics  course  in  the  hydrostatics  unit]  A solid iron sphere is ﬂoating in a bath 
of mercury.  You pour water over the sphere and cover it with water.  Does the sphere rise, 
sink, or stay at the same height?

3.	 Redesigning   problems 

a.	 For  a  course  that  you  are  likely  to  teach  or  would  like  to  teach,  choose  a  problem  from 
the usual  repertoire  for  that  course,  and write  out  the problem.  It  could  be  an  exam  or  a 
homework problem or a problem that you might ask during class. 
Then write out a modiﬁed version or  related problem  that  is  lower  in Bloom’s  taxonomy, 
and a modiﬁed version or related problem that is higher in Bloom’s taxonomy. 

b.	 Make up a new problem for this course, at whatever level of Bloom’s taxonomy you like. 

c.	 Choose  one  of  the  proposed  problems  in  Problem 2  and  make  lower- and  higher-level 
versions of it. 
Write up your new problems  and bring  them  to  class with you on Tuesday  in order  to  trade 
with a colleague. 

You can see examples of my problems under Assignments on the OCW sites for 6.055 and 18.098.
