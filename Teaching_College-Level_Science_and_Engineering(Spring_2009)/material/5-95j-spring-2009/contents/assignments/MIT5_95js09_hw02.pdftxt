Homework 2 

Due  in  class  on  Tuesday,  03   March  2009. 

1.	 Reading 

This week's readings are about misconceptions and rote learning:

1.	 Selection  from  Liping  Ma  (1999),  Knowing 
and Teaching Elementary Mathematics: Teachers’ 
Understanding  of  Fundamental  Mathematics  in  China  and  the  United   States, Lawrence Erlbaum. 
The selection  is extensive  for  the curious;  for our purposes,  skim or  read Chapter 3  (divi­
sion by fractions). 

2.	 Frederick Reif (1995), Millikan Lecture 1994: Understanding and teaching important scien­
tiﬁc thought processes, American  Journal  of  Physics  63:17–32. 

3.	 Gerd Gigerenzer, Wolfgang Gaissmaier,  Elke Kurz-Milcke,  Lisa M.  Schwartz,  and  Steven 
Woloshin (2008), Helping doctors and patients make sense of health statistics, Psychological 
Science   in   the   Public  Interest   8(2):53–96. 
Skim them, then choose your favorite to read more carefully (feel free to choose more than one 
if you are inspired), and write a question about it for yourself (no need to turn it in). 

2.	 Identify   a  misconception 
Identify a misconception that you have seen in students (or in yourself), and describe it on an 
index card. Turn in the index card in class. 

3.	 Teaching  equations 
Choose  one  of  the  equations  from Homework  1,  or  choose  another  equation  that  you might 
teach or would like to teach. Then plan and write out how you would teach it so that students 
get interested in it and are likely to understand and learn it. 
Bring  your  ‘equation  treatment’  to  class.  In  class  you’ll  give  your  treatment  to  a  randomly 
chosen member of the class.  So be sure to write your name and email address on it, and make 
your discussion of the equation and your pedagogical reasoning understandable to someone 
who might not be an expert in your ﬁeld. 
For the followup assignment, the recipient will help you improve your writeup, and you’ll do 
the same for someone else.
