Homework 6 

Due  in  class  on  Tuesday,  28   April  2009. 

1.	 Using  slides 
Read the following items on using slides (both on the course website): 

1.	 the paper by Jean-Luc Doumont on ‘Slides are not all evil’; 

2.	 the  online  analysis  by  Edward  Tufte,  ‘PowerPoint  Does  Rocket  Science–and  Better  Tech­
niques  for Technical Reports’.  At  that site,  read  the ﬁrst  item  (written by Tufte and dated 
September  6,  2005).  The  rest  of  the  thread  is  optional  but  makes  for  further  interesting 
reading. 
Both  items  concern  technical presentations  and not  teaching directly.  From  each  reading,  jot 
down  one  idea  that  you  believe  transfers  to  teaching  (i.e.  that  applies  to  teaching  and  to 
technical presentations) and one that does not transfer to teaching. 
Bring your lists to lecture on Tuesday (no need to turn them in). 

2.	 Using  blackboards 
Based on the teaching principles that we’ve discussed so far, what are advantages and disad­
vantages of using blackboards versus slides?  Write a  few pros and cons down on your sheet 
and bring them to lecture (no need to turn them in).
