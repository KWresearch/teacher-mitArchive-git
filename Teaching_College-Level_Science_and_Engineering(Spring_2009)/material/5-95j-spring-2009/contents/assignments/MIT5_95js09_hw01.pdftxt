Homework 1 

Due  in  class  on  Tuesday,  10   Feb  2009. 

Reading 
The readings mentioned below are linked from the ‘readings’ section of the website. 
At the beginning of class on Tuesday (10 Feb), please turn in the index card mentioned below. The 
index card has two purposes:  (1) to give a structure for reading before class; and (2) to show me 
what you ﬁnd most interesting about the readings and their relation to teaching. 

1.  Chunking 
Read  the  famous paper on  chunking by George Miller.  As you  read  it,  think  about how  this 
information  can  help  one  teach  equations.  On  one  side  of  an  index  card,  write  down  one 
question that occurs to you about the paper or because of reading the paper. 
Please write your name on the card! 

2.  Benezet 
Read about Benezet’s experiment in mathematics teaching (Parts I and III, with Part II option­
al).  They are my favorite papers on teaching.  On the other side of the index card, write down 
one question that occurs to you about the papers or because of reading the papers. 

Equations 

3.  How   might  you  teach  it? 
Choose one of these equations and think about how you might teach it: 

a.  Ideal-gas law: 

pV  =  nRT, 

where p  is  the pressure, V  is  the volume, n  is  the number of moles, R  is  the gas constant, 
and T  is the temperature. 
(cid:115) 
b.  Period of a simple pendulum (for small amplitudes): 
T  =  2π 

, 

l 
g 

where T  is the period, l is the length of the string, and g is the gravitational acceleration. 

c.  Stefan–Boltzmann law: 

F  =  σT 4  ,

where F is energy ﬂux, T  is temperature, and σ is Stefan’s constant. 

d.  Beam equation: 

EI 

d4u 
dx4 

=  w(x),

where E  is  the  elastic modulus,  I  is  the areal moment of  inertia,  x  is  the  coordinate along 
the beam, u  is the deﬂection, and w(x) is the load. 
(cid:88) 
e.  Euler ’s famous sum:

= 

. 

f.  Another famous Euler formula, this time for a solid object: 

V  − E +  F  =  2, 

where V  is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. 
Nothing  is  required  to  be  turned  in  for  this  problem;  just  think  it  through  (collaboration  en­
couraged!)  and make notes for yourself.
