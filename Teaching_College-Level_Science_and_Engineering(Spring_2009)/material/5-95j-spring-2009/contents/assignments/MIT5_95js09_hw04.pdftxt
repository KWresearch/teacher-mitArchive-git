Homework 4 

Due  in  class  on  Tuesday,  31   March  2009. 

Here are questions to work on and readings for Lecture 6 (March 31). The only item to bring in is 
your writeup for Problem 2, so that you can trade it with a colleague.  (And bring your problems 
from last time to exchange, which I forgot to arrange in lecture on the 17th.) 

1.	 Readings  on  lectures  and   interactive   teaching 

This week's readings are related to lectures and interactive teaching - the topic of the next lecture:

a.	 Benjamin Bloom  (1984),  ‘The  2-sigma problem:  The  search  for methods of group  instruc­
tion as effective as one-to-one tutoring’, Educational  Researcher  13(6):4–16. 

b.	 Edwin  F.  Taylor  (1992),  ‘Guest  comment:  Only  the  student  knows’,  American  Journal   of 
Physics  60(3):201–202. 

c.	 Robert Morrison (1985), ‘The lecture system in teaching science’, in Proceedings  of  the  Chica­
go  Conferences  on   Liberal  Education, No.  1, Undergraduate  Education  in  Chemistry  and   Physics, 
edited  by Marian  R.  Rice,  The  College  Center  for  Curricular  Thought,  The  University  of 
Chicago, October 18–19, 1985. 
Read  all  three!  One  is  short  (two  pages),  one  is  written  in  a  highly  enjoyable  style  (it’s  a 
transcript of a wonderful talk), and all are interesting. Write a question about each reading for 
yourself (no need to turn it in). 

2.	 Big  ideas 
For  a  course  that  you might  teach  or would  like  to  teach,  look  through  the  standard  course 
materials (e.g.  the usual textbook and problems), and ﬁnd several – perhaps four or ﬁve – big 
ideas or core reasoning methods around which to reorganize the course.  If you ﬁnd more than 
ﬁve, try to clump them as I did for the Art of Approximation course (which had eight ideas). 
Then select topics and examples for each big idea, and thereby make a rough course outline. 

3.	 Holiday  
Have a good spring break!
