Homework 5 

Due  in  class  on  Tuesday,  14   April  2009. 

1.  Lecture   planning   and  performing 
Watch  one of Walter  Lewin’s  8.01   lectures  on  OCW from  Fall  1999: 
http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Physics/8-01Physics-IFall1999/CourseHome/ 
A famous  lecture   is  number  10  (simple  harmonic  motion),  but  watch  that  lecture  or  any  other 
from  the  course  that  interests  you.  
As   you  are  watching,  note  down  on  an  index  card aspects  of  the  lecture  that  make  it  work  so 
well.  These  observations  could  be   about  the  organization,  topics  covered,  how  it  is  performed 
and  delivered,  or  many   other  areas.  On  the  reverse  side  of  the  card,  note  one  or   two  ways  in 
which  you  would  do  it  differently. 
Bring  your  card  to  lecture.  We’ll  use  your  observations  to  seed  our  discussion  of  ‘Lecture 
planning  and  performing’.
