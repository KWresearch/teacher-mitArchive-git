At the end of each lesson, students completed feedback forms to comment on what
worked and what was confusing during that lesson. At the start of the following
lesson, I addressed these comments. In these video discussions, I have linked
the lesson with its corresponding questions as a learning aid, even though I
would not have been able to do so in real time. Due to technical difficulties,
only a portion of lecture 1 is available for viewing; lecture 6 is missing
except for the answers to lecture 6 questions generated in lecture 7.
