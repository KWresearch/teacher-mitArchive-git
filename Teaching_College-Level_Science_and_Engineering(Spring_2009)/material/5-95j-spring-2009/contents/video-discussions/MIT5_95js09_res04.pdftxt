Questions  from  Lecture 1


In  reality 

What  about  grading?  How  would  you  actually  implement  your  grading  policy  as  an  assistant 
prof in a traditional department? 

You’ve  obviously  done  this  many  times  before.  As  someone  who  needs  to  ﬁgure  out  a  logical 
order for the material, in addition to balancing prep time and research, how do we juggle all this 
in addition to simply focusing on style? 

How does this work  in the real world?  (Where your time  is  limited and there  is sometimes a  lot 
of material to cover?) 

Syllabus/Logistics 

Any exams, psets? How are we being evaluated?


Does it matter which subject number we are assigned for?


Break after 1 hour?


Biology examples?


Interactive  teaching 

How do you teach a class interactively if you have a  lot  of material to get through?


If a demo is not possible for a concept, is it worth using the same model if the ‘demo’ is a medium-

length derivation?


How to pace lectures? Too many demos means less material – advanced students would be bored.


Can these principles be applied to upper-level/graduate classes?


What are the risks related to using discussion-based teaching?  Are there situations where this  is

not suitable?


How  to  deal  with  classes  where  someone  dominates  a  discussion  or  the  class  does  not  like  to

participate?


When do you choose to do these things?  e.g. You said that sometimes you don’t give time for self-

discussion. . .  Why? Time constraints?  Is it for follow-up discussions (like the v4/v1  example?) 

2 

You did not give much background as  to what  the exercise was going  to be.  Is  that because  it  is 
a teaching example?  Because you wanted us to think broader?  When would it be appropriate to 
give more background to the example? 

Regarding blackboard – is it different than using the whiteboard?


How do you get students to talk when you ask a question and they do not answer?


How do you cope with the variety of conﬁdence levels among students?


We made a list of what happened and why it was done that way.  It would be great to see more of

them from your perspective.


What about the left brain?  Surely humor and demos cannot take you all the way.


General 

What is moral choice in teaching?


Wasn’t Anne sullivan Helen Keller ’s teacher (not Alexander Graham Bell)?


How does big chalk increase SNR?


How to project conﬁdence?  Fake it till you make it?


How to get students to construct meaning from a lesson if, as you said, meaning cannot be trans­

mitted?


Using   readings 

How  to  integrate  reading  material?  What  sorts  of  material  should  be  covered  in  class  versus 
reading – how to pick readings? How much? 

Will we practice teaching in class or will you be at the front the whole time? 

Drag 

You wrote that the drag force was related to ρ, v, A, and ν.  It seemed like that was pulled out of 
nowhere. 

In deriving the answer to the four cones versus one cone problem, how did v  change when using 
the F  =  ρAv2  result? 

Becoming  a  better  teacher 

How long did it take you to become such a good teacher?


If I’m not actually a TA, what can I do to practice becoming a better teacher?
