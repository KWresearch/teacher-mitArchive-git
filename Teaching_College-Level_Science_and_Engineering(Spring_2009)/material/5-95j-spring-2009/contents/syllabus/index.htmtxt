***** Description *****
This participatory seminar focuses on the knowledge and skills necessary for
teaching science and engineering in higher education. This course is designed
for graduate students interested in an academic career, and anyone else
interested in teaching. Readings and discussions include: teaching equations
for understanding, designing exam and homework questions, incorporating
histories of science, creating absorbing lectures, teaching for transfer, the
evils of PowerPoint, and planning a course. The subject is appropriate for both
novices and those with teaching experience.
***** Prerequisites *****
There are no prerequisites for this course except passion for teaching and
curiosity about the learning process.

Lesson plan (PDF)   Teachers make lesson plans. Here is a form for a sample
                    lesson.
                    After class is over, students can give feedback on the
Feedback form (PDF) lesson's strong and weak points. Here is a form to aid
                    students in giving comments.
                    If there are lecture notes, students and instructors can
Reading memo (PDF)  benefit from student comments about the material. Here is a
                    description of the reading memos activity.

***** Classroom Routine *****
At the beginning of each class, I answer questions from the feedback forms from
the previous lesson. This activity helps me connect what you know with what you
found confusing before starting on the next lesson. During the lesson, I ask
questions and give you time to think about them before you respond. At the end
of the lesson, I ask you to complete feedback forms for the lesson.
***** Grading *****
The grading for this course is Pass/D/Fail. Everyone passes by completing the
assignments. For further information about course philosophy, refer to
"Everyone Should Get an A" by David MacKay. ([This resource may not render
