Reading  memos


[First section borrowed almost verbatim from Edwin F. Taylor, ‘Guest comment: Only the student 
knows’, American Journal of Physics 60(3):201–202 (March 1992).] 

Students! 

Text removed due to copyright restrictions. First section of the article. It motivates students to write
reading memos, because after a certain point the author no longer can find the mistakes, difficult areas
 and potential improvements in the writing.

How reading 
memos help you
The  previous  section  explained  how  reading memos  help  us.  Here’s  how  they  help  you.  First, 
you  practice  reading  a  technical  textbook.  Even  after  you  ﬁnish  taking  courses  at MIT  or  other 
universities,  the world  is  large and  there are many  lifetimes of  fascinating  ideas  to  learn.  If you 
can learn from books, you have mastered a lifelong skill. 
Second, and related to the ﬁrst point, by reading with attention and with a questioning attitude, 
you participate in your own learning. That skill too will be useful for your whole life.

Third,  reading memos reverse  the normal  teacher–student hierarchy.  For a contrast,  think about 
problem  sets.  If  you  cannot  solve  a  problem,  you  might  feel  incapable  and  might  become  un­
happy.  I felt that way when I was a student. With a reading memo, when you do not understand 
where  an  equation  came  from,  or  follow  an  argument,  you  have  found  a  problem  in  the  notes. 
One  of  my  teachers,  Donald  Knuth,  was  so  interested  in  knowing  about  any  problems  that  he 
would  write  us  checks  for  $2.56  for  every  mistake  that  we  found.  I’m  not  as  generous;  on  the 
other hand, maybe Knuth was not giving away much – who would cash a check from Knuth?  (I 
still have all of mine.)  As it says in the preceding section in Edwin Taylor ’s words, with reading 
memos you are a world-class expert. 
Use  the  reading   memos  as  a  way   to   to  practice  reading  technical  material,  to  formulate  ques­
tions,  and  to  feel  like,  no  to   be  an  expert.
