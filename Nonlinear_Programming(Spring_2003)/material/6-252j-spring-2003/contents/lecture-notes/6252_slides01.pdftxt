LECTURE 1:  INTRODUCTION 

LECTURE OUTLINE 
•  Nonlinear Programming 
•  Application Contexts 
•  Characterization Issue 
•  Computation Issue 
•  Duality 
•  Organization 

NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING 
 

min f (x), 

x∈X(cid:160)

where 
•  f  : (cid:1)n(cid:160) (cid:2)→ (cid:1)  is a continuous (and usually differ-
entiable) function of n variables 
•  X = (cid:1)n(cid:160) or X is a subset of (cid:1)n(cid:160) with a “contin u-
ous” char acter. 

•  If X = (cid:1)n , the problem is called unconstrained 
•  If  f  is  linear and X  is polyhedral,  the problem 
is a  linear programming problem.  Otherwise  it  is 
a nonlinear programming problem 
•  Linear and nonlinear programming have  tradi-
tionally  been  treated  separately.  Their  method-
ologies have gradually come closer. 

TWO MAIN ISSUES• 
•	  Characterization of minima 
−  Necessary conditions 
−  Sufﬁcient conditions 
−  Lagrange multiplier theory 
−  Sensitivity 
−  Duality 
•	  Computation by iterative algorithms 
−  Iterative descent 
−  Approximation methods 
−  Dual and primal-dual methods 

APPLICATIONS OF NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING•
•  Data networks – Routing 
•  Production planning 
•  Resource allocation 
•  Computer-aided design 
•  Solution of equilibrium models 
•  Data analysis and least squares formulations 
•  Modeling human or organizational behavior 



CHARACTERIZATION PROBLEM
 
•   Unconstrained problems 
−   Zero 1st order variation along all directions 
•   Constrained problems 
− 
	 Nonnegative 1st order variation along all fea-
sible directions 
•   Equality constraints 
− 
	 Zero 1st order  variation along all directions 
on the constraint surface 
−   Lagrange multiplier theory 
•   Sensitivity 

COMPUTATION PROBLEM
 
•  Iterative descent 
•  Approximation 
•  Role of convergence analysis 
•  Role of rate of convergence analysis 
•  Using an existing package to solve a nonlinear 
programming problem 

POST-OPTIMAL ANALYSIS 
•  Sensitivity 
•  Role of Lagrange multipliers as prices 

DUALITY

lem duality

(a) 
Illustration of the optimal values of the min common point 
and max intercept point problems.  In (a), the two optimal 
values  are  not  equal.  In  (b),  the  set  S ,  when  “extended 
upwards” along the nth axis, yields the set 
S¯ = {¯ 
x(cid:160)|  for some x(cid:160)∈ S , ¯  
xn(cid:160) ≥ xn , ¯
xi(cid:160) = xi , i (cid:160)= 1, . . . , n (cid:160)− 1} 

which  is  convex.  As  a  result,  the  two  optimal  values  are 
equal.  This fact, when suitably formalized, is the basis for 

some of the most important duality results.
