where  f  :  (cid:1)n  (cid:2)→ (cid:1),  hi  :  (cid:1)n  (cid:2)→ (cid:1),  are  continuously

A BASIC LEMMA


Lemma:  Let P  and Q be two symmetric matrices. 
Assume  that Q ≥  0 and P >  0 on  the nullspace of 
P x  >  0  for  all  x  (cid:7)= 0  with  x
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
Q,  i.e.,  x
Qx  = 0.  Then 
there exists a scalar c such that 

P + cQ : positive deﬁnite, 

∀  c >  c.


Proof:  Assume  the  contrary.  Then  for  every  k, 
there exists a vector xk  with (cid:9)xk (cid:9) = 1  such that 
(cid:2)

Qxk  ≤ 0.

Then  there  exists  an  open  sphere  S  centered  at 
u = 0  such that for every u ∈ S , there is an x(u) and 
a λ(u), which are a local minimum-Lagrange mul-
tiplier  pair  of  problem  (*).  Fur thermore,  x(·)  and 
λ(·) are continuously differentiable within S and we

∀  u ∈ S
