******************************** 
•  Consider the problem 

j = 1, . . . , r,


minimize  f (x)

gj (x) ≤ 0,
subject to  x ∈ X, 
assuming −∞ < f  
∗  < ∞. 
•  µ 
∗  ≥  0  and  f
∗  is  a  Lagrange  multiplier  if  µ

inf x∈X L(x, µ 
).

DUALITY THEOREM FOR INEQUALITIES


•  Assume  that  X  is  convex  and  the  functions 
f  : (cid:5)n  (cid:6)→ (cid:5),  gj  : (cid:5)n  (cid:6)→ (cid:5)  are  convex  over  X .  Fur-
∗  is  ﬁnite  and  there 
thermore,  the optimal value  f
exists a vector ¯x ∈ X  such that 
∀  j = 1, . . . , r. 

gj (¯x) < 0, 

•  Strong Duality Theorem:  There exists at  least 
one  Lagrange  multiplier  and  there  is  no  duality 
gap. 

A = {(z,w) | there is an x in X such that g(x) ≤  z, f(x) ≤ w}

PROOF OUTLINE


•  Show that A is convex.  [Consider vectors (z , w) ∈ 
A and (˜  w) ∈ A, and show that their convex com-
z ,  ˜ 
binations lie in A.] 
•  Observe that (0, f
∗
) is not an interior point of A. 
•  Hence,  there  is  hyperplane  passing  through 
∗
)  and  containing  A  in  one  of  the  two  corre-
(0, f  
sponding halfspaces; i.e., a (µ, β ) (cid:9)= (0, 0) with 
β f   ≤ βw  + µ z ,  
∀  (z , w) ∈ A.

(cid:3)
∗
This implies that β ≥ 0, and µj  ≥ 0 for all j . 
•  Prove that hyperplane is nonver tical, i.e., β >  0. 
•  Normalize (β = 1), take the inﬁmu m over x ∈ X , 
and use the fact µ ≥ 0, to obtain 
(cid:2) 
(cid:1) 
f  ≤  inf  f (x) +  µ g(x) = q(µ) ≤  sup q(µ) =  q .

Using  the weak duality  theorem, µ  is a Lagrange 
multiplier and there is no duality gap. 

LINEAR EQUALITY CONSTRAINTS 

•  Suppose we have the additional constraints 
i x − di  = 0,
(cid:3) 
e


i = 1, . . . , m 


•  We need the notion of the aﬃne hul l of a convex 
set X  [denoted af f (X )].  This is the intersection of 
all hyperplanes containing X . 
•  The relative interior of X , denoted ri(X ), is the set 
of all x ∈ X  s.t. there exists � >  0 with 
(cid:1) 
(cid:2) 
⊂ X,

z | (cid:10)z − x(cid:10) < �,  z ∈ af f (X )


that is, ri(X ) is the interior of X  relative to af f (X ). 
•  Every  nonempty  convex  set  has  a  nonempty 
relative interior. 

DUALITY THEOREM FOR EQUALITIES


•  Assumptions: 
−	 The set X  is convex and  the  functions  f ,  gj 
are convex over X . 
−	 The optimal value f
∗  is ﬁnite  and there exists 
a vector ¯x ∈ ri(X ) such that 

j = 1, . . . , r, 

gj (¯x) < 0,
e
i
¯x − di  = 0,
(cid:3) 
i = 1, . . . , m. 
•  Under  the preceding assumptions  there exists 
at  least  one  Lagrange  multiplier  and  there  is  no 
duality gap. 

COUNTEREXAMPLE


•  Consider 

minimize  f (x) =  x1 
subject to  x2 = 0,

(cid:1) 
x ∈ X = (x1 , x2 ) | x1 
2

(cid:2) 
≤ x2  . 

•  The optimal solution is x 
∗  = (0, 0) and f 
∗  = 0. 
•  The dual function is given by 
(cid:3) 
− 4
{x1 + λx2 } =  −∞, 
1 
λ , 

if λ >  0,
if λ ≤ 0.

q(λ) =  
inf
≤x2
x2 
1

•  No dual optimal solution and therefore there is 
no Lagrange multiplier.  (Even though there  is no 
duality gap.) 
•  Assumptions are violated (the feasible set and 
the relative interior of X  have no common point). 

FENCHEL DUALITY FRAMEWORK


•  Consider the problem 
minimize  f1 (x) − f2 (x) 
sub ject to  x ∈ X1 ∩ X2 , 
where  f1  and  f2  are  real-valued  functions  on (cid:5)n , 
and X1  and X2  are subsets of (cid:5)n . 
•  Assume that −∞ < f  
∗  < ∞. 
•  Conver t problem to 
minimize  f1 (y) − f2 (z )

y ∈ X1 ,
sub ject to  z = y ,  

z ∈ X2 ,


and dualize the constraint z = y .
