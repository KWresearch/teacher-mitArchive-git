dent rows and b ∈ (cid:1)m  is a given vector.

•  Since xk  → x 
∗ , for large k, xk  is interior to S , and 
is an unconstrained local minimum of F k (x). 
•  From 1st order necessary condition, 
0 =  ∇F k (x k ) =  ∇f (x k )+k∇h(x k )h(x k )+α(x k −x  ).  (3) 
∗ 

Since  ∇h(x 
)  has  rank  m,  ∇h(xk )  also  has  rank 
∗
m  for  large  k, so ∇h(xk )
