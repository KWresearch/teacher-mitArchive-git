LECTURE OUTLINE


•  Duality and L-multipliers (continued) 
•  Consider the problem 

minimize  f (x)

gj(cid:160)(x) ≤ 0,
subject to  x ∈ X, 
assuming −∞ < f  
∗  < ∞. 
•  µ 
∗  ≥  0  and  f
∗  is  a  Lagrange  multiplier  if  µ 
∗
inf x∈X(cid:160)L(x, µ 
). 
•  The dual problem  is 

j = 1, . . . , r,


∗  = 

maximize  q(µ) 
subject to  µ ≥ 0, 

where q  is the dual function q(µ) =  inf x∈X(cid:160)L(x, µ).

•  Weak Duality Theorem:  q

•  Lagrange  Multipliers  and  Dual  Optimal  Solu-
tions: 
(a) 	 If there is no duality gap, the set of Lagrange 
multipliers is equal to the set of optimal dual 
solutions. 
(b) 	 If there is a duality gap, the set of Lagrange 
multipliers is empty.

EXTENSIONS AND APPLICATIONS


•  Equality  constraints  hi (x) = 0,  i  = 1, . . . , m,  can 
be conver ted into the two inequality constraints 
−hi (x) ≤ 0. 
hi (x) ≤ 0,

DUALITY THEOREM I FOR CONVEX PROBLEMS

Assume that the problem 

minimize  f (x) 
subject to  x ∈ X,  ai

∗  is  ﬁnite .  Let 
is  feasible  and  its  optimal  value  f 
also f  be convex over (cid:6)n  and let X be polyhedral. 
Then there exists at least one Lagrange multiplier 
and there is no duality gap. 
•  Proof Issues 
•  Application to Linear Programming 

COUNTEREXAMPLE


•  A Convex Problem with a Duality Gap: Consider 
the two-dimensional problem 

minimize  f (x) 
subject to  x1 = 0,

x ∈ X = {x | x ≥ 0}, 

where 

−√ 
∀  x ∈ X, 
x1 x2 , 
f (x) =  e 
and f (x) is arbitrarily de ﬁned  for x /∈ X . 
•  f is convex over X (its Hessian is positive de ﬁnite 
∗ 
in the interior of X ), and f 
= 1. 
•  Also, for all µ ≥ 0 we have 
(cid:2) 
−√ 
q(µ) =  inf  e 
x≥0 

(cid:3) 
x1 x2 + µx1  = 0, 

since the expression in braces is nonnegative for 
x ≥ 0 and can approach zero by taking x1 → 0 and 
x1 x2 → ∞. It follows that q
∗ 
= 0. 

DUALITY THEOREM II FOR CONVEX PROBLEMS


•  Consider the problem 

minimize  f (x) 
subject to  x ∈ X, 

gj (x) ≤ 0,

j = 1, . . . , r. 

•  Assume  that  X  is  convex  and  the  functions 
f  : (cid:6)n  (cid:8)→ (cid:6),  gj  : (cid:6)n  (cid:8)→ (cid:6)  are  convex  over  X .  Fur-
∗  is  ﬁnite  and  there 
thermore,  the optimal value  f
exists a vector ¯x ∈ X  such that 
∀  j = 1, . . . , r. 

gj (¯x) < 0, 

•  Strong Duality Theorem:  There exists at  least 
one  Lagrange  multiplier  and  there  is  no  duality 
gap. 
•  Extension to linear equality constraints.
