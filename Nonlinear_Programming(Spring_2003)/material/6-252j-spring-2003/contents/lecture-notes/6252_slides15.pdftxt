subject to  x ∈ X, 

gj (x) ≤  bj , j  = 1, . . . , r, 

where  f  and  gj  are  continuous  and  X  is  closed. 
We assume that the set

S =

is nonempty and any feasible point is in the closure 
of S . 

BARRIER METHOD


•  Consider  a  barrier  function ,  that  is  continuous 
and goes to ∞  as any one of the constraints gj (x) 
approaches 0 from negative values.  Examples:

CONVERGENCE 
Every  limit  point  of  a  sequence  {xk }  generated 
by  a  barrier  method  is  a  global  minimum  of  the 
original constrained problem 
Proof:  Let {x} be the limit of a subsequence {xk }k∈K . 
Since xk  ∈  S  and X  is closed, x  is feasible for the 
original  problem.  If  x  is  not  a  global  minimum, 
∗  such  that  f (x 
∗
there  exists  a  feasible  x 
)  < f  (x) 
and therefore also an interior point ˜x ∈ S such that 
f (˜x) < f  (x). By the deﬁnition  of xk , f (xk ) + �kB (xk ) ≤ 
x) for all k, so by taking limit
x) +  �kB (˜ 
f (˜ 
f (x) +   lim inf  �kB (x k ) ≤ f (˜x) < f  (x) 
k→∞, k∈K


Hence lim inf k→∞, k∈K �kB (xk ) < 0. 
If  x  ∈  S , we  have  limk→∞, k∈K �kB (xk ) = 0, 
while  if  x  lies  on  the  boundary  of  S , we  have by 
assumption limk→∞, k∈K B (xk ) =  ∞.  Thus 
lim inf �kB (x k ) ≥ 0,

k→∞

– a   contradiction.

and  X  is  the  diagonal  matrix  with  xi ,  i  = 1, . . . , n

•  View q(x, �) as the Newton increment (x−x) trans-
−1  that maps x into e. 
formed by X
•  Consider  (cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6)  as  a  proximity  measure  of  the 
current point to the point x(�) on the central path. 

KEY RESULTS 

•  It  is sufﬁcient  to minimize F�  approximately, up 
to where (cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6) < 1.

•  The  “ter mination  set” 
is  par t 
of the region of quadratic convergence of the pure 
form of Newton’ s method.  In par ticular, if (cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6) < 
1,  then  the pure Newton  iterate  x = x − X q(x, �)  is 
an  interior  point,  that  is,  x  ∈  S .  Fur thermore,  we 
have (cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6) < 1 and in fact 
(cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6) ≤ (cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6)2 .

Following approximately the 
central path by using a sin­
gle  Newton  step  for  each 
�k . If  �k  is  close  to  �k+1 
and xk  is close to the cen­
tral path, one expects that 
xk+1 obtained from xk  by 
a single pure Newton step 
will  also  be  close  to  the 
central path. 

Proposition  Let  x >  0, Ax = b,  and suppose  that 
for  some  γ <  1 we  have  (cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6) ≤  γ .  Then  if  �  = 
(1 − δn

(cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6) ≤

In par ticular, if 

δ ≤ γ (1 − γ )(1 + γ )
we have (cid:6)q(x, �)(cid:6) ≤ γ . 
•  Can be used to establish nice complexity results; 
but � must be reduced VERY slowly.

LONG STEP METHODS


•  Main features: 
−	 Decrease � faster than dictated by complex-
ity analysis. 
−	 Require more than one Newton step per (ap-
proximate) minimization. 
−	 Use  line  search  as  in  unconstrained  New-
ton’ s method. 
−	 Require  much  smaller  number  of  (approxi-
mate) minimizations.
