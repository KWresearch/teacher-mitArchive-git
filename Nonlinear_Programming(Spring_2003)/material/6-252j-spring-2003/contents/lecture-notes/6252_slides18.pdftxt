LECTURE OUTLINE


•  Geometrical Framework for Duality 
•  Lagrange Multipliers 
•  The Dual Problem 
•  Proper ties of the Dual Function 
•  Consider the problem

subject to  x ∈ X, 
gj (x) ≤ 0,
assuming −∞ < f  
∗  < ∞. 
•  We assume that the problem is feasible and the 
cost is bounded from below, 
−∞ < f

MIN COMMON POINT/MAX INTERCEPT POINT


•  Let S  be a subset of (cid:4)n : 
•  Min Common Point Problem :  Among all points that 
are  common  to  both  S  and  the  nth  axis,ﬁnd 
the 
one whose nth component is minimum. 
•  Max  Intercept  Point  Problem :  Among  all  hyper-
planes that intersect the nth axis and suppor t the 
set S  from  “belo w”,  ﬁnd  the hyperplane  for which 
point of intercept with the nth axis is maximum.

THE DUAL FUNCTION AND THE DUAL PROBLEM


•  The dual problem  is 

maximize  q(µ) 
subject to  µ ≥ 0, 

where q  is the dual function 

q(µ) =  inf  L(x, µ), 
x∈X


∀  µ ∈ (cid:4)r . 

•  Question:  How does the optimal dual value q 
∗  =

supµ≥0 q(µ) relate to f

Support points 
correspond to minimizers 
of L(x,µ) over X

WEAK DUALITY


•  The domain of q  is 
(cid:2) 
(cid:1) 
Dq  =  µ | q(µ) > −∞  . 

•  Proposition:  The domain Dq  is a convex set and 
q  is concave over Dq . 
•  Proposition:  (Weak Duality Theorem) We have 
q  ≤ f .

∗ 

Proof:  For  all  µ  ≥  0,  and  x  ∈  X  with  g(x) ≤  0, we 
have 

(cid:3) 
r 
q(µ) =  inf  L(z , µ) ≤ f (x) +  
µj gj (x) ≤ f (x),

multipliers is equal to the set of optimal dual solu-
∗  < f  
∗ , the set of Lagrange multipliers 
tions.  (b) If q 
is empty.

Proof:  By deﬁnition,  a vector µ
