Different Player Types 

� Bartle’s Achievers, Explorers and 
Socializers are a nice way  to view The 
Sims players 
� Maybe because MMO’s and the Sims 
have similarities  in their spaces and often 
rely on emergent (player driven) narratives

Sniderman’s meta­games 

� Is everyone playing The Sims 2?  Or are 
they all playing different games? 
� YES, YES 
� They all share the simulation space. 
� But they have created different games  for 
themselves by  inventing different goals 
and win states.
