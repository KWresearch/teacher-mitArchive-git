CMS.600: Choosing A Video Game Assignment 

9/16/07 

I have chosen to play two games this semester, both of which belong to or derive from 

the ever-popular RPG genre: Kingdom Hearts II (SquareEnix/Disney; PS2) and Dirge of 

Cerberus (SquareEnix; PS2).  I have long been an RPG fan (specifically, a Final Fantasy 7 fan), 

and I am hoping to explore new RPGs this semester.  I have chosen these two for a variety of 

reasons that may or may not strike others as being logical. 

Reviews and accounts that I have read online and heard by ear yield the general 

consensus that Kingdom Hearts II is excellent, while Dirge of Cerberus is arguably bad 

("Kingdom Hearts II", "Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII").  Having played Kingdom Hearts 

I during the summer and enjoyed it, I am playing Kingdom Hearts II to see what has changed 

and what has remained the same in terms of gameplay, storyline, design, and content.  My main 

complaints with the first game were that it lacked character development, that the in-game 

camera was terrible, and that the gummi ship system was poorly explained and overwhelmingly 

unimpressive.  On the other hand, I was enormously fond of the more interactive battle system, a 

clear break from the wait-and-choose-an-option-from-a-limited-menu Active Time Battle system 

of Final Fantasy 7 and 8, and also loved the graphics and almost seamless integration of the 

wildly different Final Fantasy and Disney character designs.  Talking to friends who have played 

the game before and reading the Wikipedia article, it seems as if the gummi ship system was 

entirely overhauled and replaced with a new interplanetary travel system that fixed the problems 

rampant in the first iteration of the gummi ship system, such as difficult, pointless construction

and a lack of motivation to use the construction system altogether.  Furthermore, pandering to 

my button-mashing side, I am informed that there is a level where I have a chance to fight a huge 

horde of thousands upon thousands of enemies, and that while remaining essentially the same, 

the fighting system has been enhanced by some kind of special new attack (Bhat, Intihar).  The 

overwhelmingly positive reviews that I have read for the game therefore provide a fairly strong 

impetus to play it, though it is also tempered by some rather widespread complaints that the 

introduction sequence is too long, the Atlantica singing level is ridiculous, and parts of the 

storyline are confusing if the player has not previously played Kingdom Hearts: Chain of 

Memories, the Gameboy installment between Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II 

(Ramsoomair, Peng, Bhat).  Nevertheless, my desire to discover the improvements and possible 

detriments to this oft-praised series remains strong. 

Quite in contrast to the overwhelmingly positive reviews for Kingdom Hearts II, Dirge of 

Cerberus, as far as I can tell, is generally regarded as a pretty awful game - the former received a 

Metacritic rating of 87, whereas the latter received an underwhelming 57 ("Kingdom Hearts II 

(Ps2: 2006): Reviews.", "Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII (Ps2: 2006): Reviews.").  

Although it is part of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, a multi-platform expansion project 

of the Final Fantasy VII storyline, Dirge of Cerberus is not, strictly speaking, an RPG.  Unlike 

the original Final Fantasy VII, it centers on the secret character, Vincent Valentine, a formidable 

shooter and former "Turk", with a mysterious background that is hinted at in the original game.  

Accordingly, SquareEnix decided to make Dirge of Cerberus a third-person shooter game 

("Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII").  The reviews are rather scattered - some seem willing 

to give the game a chance and acknowledges the fact that it is more of an RPG-shooter hybrid 

than strictly belonging to either genre, and thereby give it the benefit of the doubt; others lambast

the game for its poor gameplay, lack of challenge, and poor level design ("Dirge of Cerberus: 

Final Fantasy VII (Ps2: 2006): Reviews.", Bettenhausen).  One might wonder, then, why I want 

to play what is, at best, a mediocre game.  The short explanation is that I'm a masochist, and like 

to inflict bad games on myself at times.  The long explanation is that many of the complaints I've 

heard about the game are things I frequently find myself liking in "good" games, and therefore 

I'm curious to see what my reaction to those flaws are.  For example: a common complaint about 

Dirge is that the movie/narrative sequences are frequent and long, and that the game plays more 

like a movie than an actual game ("Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII", "Dirge of Cerberus: 

Final Fantasy VII (Ps2: 2006): Reviews.").  I heartily enjoy long, narrative sequences, especially 

when they take place in a world I'm already in love with, and features characters I adore, and are 

rendered in stunningly beautiful graphics.  Furthermore, I'm not a big fan of shooter games, as I 

am terrible at shooting moving things (or even stationary things), and shooter games are typically 

geared for players who are much more hardcore than I am.  I am, however, a big fan of RPGs, 

and frequently find the relatively uninteractive style of RPG battle systems to be a little boring at 

times - therefore, I'm curious to see how well the toned-down shooter style of Dirge suits me.  

Lastly, I am a shameless Final Fantasy VII fangirl, and I really want to play the last 

(chronologically-speaking) episode of the series, as I can never really get enough of its universe. 

Both games promise to take up more than 70 hours together, especially when one 

considers the type of gamer that I am.  I'm the type of person who can run around in Oblivion for 

hours just picking little plants and making potions; I also am known to spend incredible amounts 

of time sitting around in Final Fantasy VIII Drawing magic from monsters just to get my stock 

up to 100 for each spell.  Sandbox and RPG games are, fittingly enough, my favorite genre of 

games, and I am interested to see how these two RPGs/RPG-shooters pan out.
