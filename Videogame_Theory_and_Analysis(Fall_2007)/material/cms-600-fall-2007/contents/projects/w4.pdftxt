Farmer and Morningstar document the creation of Habitat, a precursor to today’s 
MMORPGs. They mention that the content of the game is more important than its 
presentation, and espouse administrative avatars always working within game rules. 
Finally they mention that encouraging user-generated content should be a goal for future 
games. 
 
Speaking from experience, Farmer and Morningstar urge developers of MMOGs to focus 
on facilitating communication and not on enriching displays, to cater to the emerging 
desires of the users instead of planning out the game experience, and to maintain the 
fairness of the game without breaking its illusion of reality. 
 
Cyberspace is about human interaction; presentation and technology should serve that 
purpose. Humans have fun in different ways, and are good at different things. Humans 
like the illusion of reality: work within the system. Humans cheat--guard against it. 
Otherwise, though, let the organism do whatever it damn well pleases. 
 
Farmer’s and Morningstar’s analysis presents a detailed example that supports 
Sniderman’s observations. Habitat demonstrates the importance of a foundation 
containing inviolable written rules while also emphasizing the need for artistic license as 
a means for the players’ personal entertainment and immersion in the fabricated 
environment.  
 
Farmer & Morningstar discuss Habitat, emphasizing the player’s role in an early 
MMORPG.   They argue that despite having a set of written rules, the most important 
aspect of this and future games is the player’s ability to create and play by their own 
rules, immersing themselves within the game’s environment. 
 
Several lessons were learned by Farmer and Morningstar during the days of Habitat. 
Communication and interactions within an MMORPG should be prioritized above 
graphical appearance. This allows an active cyberspace community to develop.  
Decisions made by game officials may have unexpected results, due to the very nature of 
the game community.
