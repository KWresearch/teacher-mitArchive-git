Why DID I Want to Play It?

• Because it’s unique
• Because I love board games
• Because I love fighters

• Because I wanted to know why nobody 
else plays / makes / enjoys this kind of 
game

Overview

• Wrath Unleashed has a huge 
problem

• So why did I finish it (and enjoy it)?

• The answer requires an addendum to our 
theories of “why we play” to understand

The Big Problem
• Wrath Unleashed has the worst 
narrative I have ever 
encountered

• It is Meager
• It is Predictable
• It is Deceptive

• There are four characters, but only two cut-scenes!

It is Predictable

• Every character has a 
very similar final 
battle (against the 
other three)

• Every character has 
the same ending

It is Deceptive

• The formal constraints do not match the 
material constraints

• Formal constraint – your goal is to fend off 
an ambush from the Earth Demigod

• Material constraint – you must kill the 
Earth Demigod or capture 7 of 9 temples

The Narrative Fails

• Because it’s it does not provide any 
immersion 

• Because there’s no motivation to find out 
what happens next

• Because beginners will be confused as to 
what their goals are

Strategic Elements

• Pieces have different strengths
• Hexes give elemental advantages
• Spells can be cast on the world map
• Maps have special hexes (temples, mana
wats, amplifiers, nexus points, teleporters, 
etc.)

Adding to the Challenge

• Recognizable AI tendencies

A New Category of Play
(not covered by Callois)

• Not a meeting of equals on a field of battle
• Not a game of chance
• Not mimicry because there’s NO 
immersion
• Not much of an adrenaline rush (usually)

Player vs. Designer

• Player motivation comes from the 
challenge provided by the designer

• The two sides have different goals

• Popularized by video games

But can you really play a game with 
no narrative?...

Jenkins’ Emergent Narratives

• These games provide a space to explore

• The player will make up narrative about 
themselves. 
Even if the only characters are the player 
and the AI.

Juul on Players vs. Viewers

• “The reader/viewer need an emotional 
motivation for investing energy in the 
movie or book; we need a human actant to 
identify with. This is probably also true for 
the computer game, only this actant is 
always present - it is the player. The 
player is motivated to invest energy in the 
game because the game evaluates the 
player's performance.”

In Summary

• Games can be enjoyable without any 
formal narrative or constraints

• Video games have popularized a new type 
of play – Player vs. Designer

• The player remains engaged in these 
games because they construct narratives 
around themselves
