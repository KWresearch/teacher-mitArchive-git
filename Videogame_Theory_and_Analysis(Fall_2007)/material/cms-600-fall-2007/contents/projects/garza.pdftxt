Choosing a Video Game 

In many games, you’re thrown into a seemingly impossible situation, given an objective, 

and sent along on your way, assuming you share the same beliefs, wants, and values that the 

protagonist should feel. However, more and more games are breaking this and allowing the 

gamer to make their own decisions, decide what’s right and wrong, and decide what path they 

want to go down. But, like James Gee pointed out in his Cultural Models essay, you must believe 

in your goals, purposes, and values in the game, and one’s person vision of good may conflict 

with another’s. Because of this interesting take on good and evil, I’ve decided on a series of 

games that puts emphasis on a morality system, specifically Knights of the Old Republic I&II 

and Fable. Besides being chosen because of their moral choices, I’ve also taken into account that 

they all were released for PC. Because I do not have any consoles here at MIT, but I do have a 

gaming capable computer, this is a huge plus. 

Both Knights of the Old Republic (KoTOR) games send you on the path to becoming a 

Jedi. However, whether you join the Light side or Dark side is up to the player. Both games 

received over 9/10 points from both 1up.com and Game Informer Online. Like Game Informers 

review noted about KoTOR, “Rather than stepping into the shoes of a prefabricated character, 

players are invited to create their own personality.” Through your path to save or destroy the 

galaxy, you not only influence your story and choices, but, those of your team and comrades. 

Through an expertly crafted story that’s supposedly going to have an awesome twist (I haven’t 

played it yet), you feel like you’re living the Jedi experience, choosing your powers, and skills

along the way. Alfredo Angeles spoke highly of the game, saying that “it was like watching 

another Star Wars movie, only with the immersion of a game”.  According to posts made on a 

forum discussing how long players took to beat KoTOR, the game can last from 25 to 50 hours, 

depending on how thorough you go through the game, and the player’s skill.  

My other choice, Fable, is “a world that will emerge you into a unique and evocative 

artistic style of intense depth and beauty”. In Fable you’re playing the part of a young boy whose 

village is destroyed. Through an immersive and fascinating story, you realize your potential, and 

write your own story. Alex Rodriguez warned that it Fable doesn’t just allow you to be good or 

evil, but, the world reacts to your decisions and treats you like an admirable hero or a despicable 

villain. However, the world isn’t the only thing that molds to your choices and actions, your 

appearance acts as a reflection of the conscience of both the gamer and their character. Steven 

Garza spoke of gasping in horror when he looked upon his newly developing horns, and the 

pride he felt in the faint glow of light surrounded his avatar when he changed his ways. Every 

action changes your appearance and how people react to you, even your battle scars, clothing 

combinations, tattoos, and food that you eat. I think Game Informer summarizes it best with their 

statement, “Its more than just clear-cut options of good and evil- you are creating a person.”
