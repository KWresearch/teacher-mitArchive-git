Caillois names and defines four categories of games: agôn (competition on an artificially 
leveled playing field), alea (games of chance), mimicry (role-playing, or make pretend), 
and Ilinx (disorientating oneself, thrill-seeking and risk taking). Finally he explains the 
dichotomy between the childish glee of paidia and the arbitrary self-challenge of ludus. 
 
Caillois attempts to define play (as an activity that is voluntary, has an unknown 
conclusion, and produces nothing) and to classify the types of games that may be played, 
breaking them into games of skill, luck, imitation, and adrenaline, while also categorizing 
them by their degree of structure and rules.   
 
What is a game?  Though they can never be defined absolutely, Caillois, Suits, 
Costikyan, and Björk and Holopainen give their varied opinions based on different views 
and professions.  Then Caillois disassembles Huzingas’ definition of play, classifies 
games into agôn, alea, mimicry, and ilinx, and scales games between paidia and ludus. 
 
Caillois defines play as activities with the characteristics of being "free", "separate", 
"uncertain", "unproductive", rule-bound, and/or "make-believe", and constructs his 
classification of games into four main categories: agôn (competition), alea (chance), 
mimicry (simulation), and ilinx (vertigo), which are further refined by a game's leaning 
towards paidia (chaos) or ludus (order). 
 
Agon: Balanced competition validates superiority. 
Alea: Passivity? Appealing. Randomness equalizes. 
Mimicry: Improvisational role-playing, spectacle. 
Ilinx: Disorientation--"pleasurable torture"! 
 
Paidia: Instinctive exuberance. 
Ludus: Refined, contrived, disciplined. Mastery rewarded.

Caillois realizes the difficulty in classifying different modes of play. He comes up with 
the catagories of competition, chance, simulation, and vertigo. Within each of these 
catagories, there is a relation to levels spanning from child-like play to play that requires 
mature skill. 
 
Play is ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom.  At its foundation, play is 
unproductive, contained, unreal, and optional.  Caillois attempts to classify all forms of

play into games of competition, chance, simulation, and vertigo; each type spans the 
continuum from instinctive improvisation to calculated skill. 
 
Caillois expands on Huizinga's definition of play: unproductive (no goods produced), 
voluntary, removed (isolated from the real world), unpredictable, and either ruled (e.g., 
chess) or make-believe (e.g., WoW). He categorizes games as: agon (competition of 
some skill), alea (no control over outcome) mimicry, ilinx (pursuit of vertigo, e.g., 
horseback riding). 
 
Caillois outlines the qualities an activity must possess to be considered play.  He further 
classifies play according to four categories, agôn (competition), alea (chance), mimicry 
(simulation), and ilinix (vertigo).  Caillos also describes the rule-based nature of play 
along a spectrum ranging from paidia (free, improvisational) to ludus (disciplined, highly 
rule-based). 
 
Callois’ piece circulates around categorizing different types of play, to define play. The 
four main types of play are competition type agon, chance and gambling type alea, 
simulation type mimicry, and disorienting and vertigo type ilinix. All of these are also 
stratified according to the amount of organization involved. 
 
Because playing is simultaneously unpredictable, unproductive, uninhibited, and unreal, 
while also structured and regulated, such a multitude of games exist that classification 
into those seeking competition, pure chance, imitation, and distorted perceptions becomes 
hardly possible. Nevertheless, either sheer excitement or satisfaction lies at the root of all 
play. 
 
Caillois discuses the classifications and definitions of play taking into consideration the 
way peoples throughout different times and cultures have utilized available resources to 
play.  He contends that there are four classifications: Competition, Chance, Simulation, 
and Veritgo, and a spectrum of organization and sophistication for each. 
 
Roger Caillois seeks to define the idea of play and its role in different types of games.  
From his analysis, we see four types of games – competition (agôn), chance (alea), 
simulation (mimicry), and vertigo (ilinix) – each containing a higher degree of play, from 
paidia, to the lowest degree, ludus. 
 
People need definitions. Their need arises from a purpose, (philosophy, design, etc...). 
Purpose influences their definitions. Caillois creates a venn diagram for the set of "all 
games". He names characteristics of games, and organizes games by their characteristics. 
He distinguishes "play" with respect to animals, children, and adults. 
 
Callois analyzes play within society, categorizing it as “agon”, activity utilizing skill, 
“alea”, ability independent games of luck, “mimicry”, play where impersonation and 
simulation become reality, and “ilinx”, pursuit of vertigo and sensation, all of which span 
a spectrum of “paidia” and “ludus”, seemingly effortless unrestrained jubilation or 
meticulous dedication.

Callois provides a definition of play, being free, separate, uncertain, unproductive, rule 
driven or make believe (the last two are not exclusive or required), and a categorization 
of games based on Agon (competition), Alea (chance), Mimicry, and Ilinx (vertigo) with 
each category ranging from paidia (turbulence) to ludus (rules). 
 
The Caillois text outlines a simple taxonomy of games.  The author separates games into 
four categories:  Agon (competition with set rules), Alea (games of chance), Mimicry 
(games of make-believe), and Ilinx (games of disorientation).  Games can also range on a 
sliding-scale between Paidia (unregulated) to Ludus (strict rules). 
 
Caillois examines the concept of play by first attempting to define the term and the 
qualities that play must have and then by separating the different types of play into 
classes and providing a number of examples for each class.
