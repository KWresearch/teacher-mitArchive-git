Environmental Storytelling 

“Spatial stories can evoke pre-
existing narrative associations; 

they can provide a staging ground 

for when narrative events are  

enacted; they may embed narrative 

information within their mise-en
-
scene; or they provide resources 

for emergent narratives.”

Archimonde vs. Draenei


Main villain from WC3 is a 
Draenei, visual 
associations add a 
foreboding sense to the 
race in WoW, even without 
explicit reference to the 
character. Later in the 
WoW story-progression, 
we indeed encounter more 
fallen Draenei.

Game Mechanics 

•	 Extra-narrative code decisions about 
the way in which the world works 
affect all levels of game play. 

– Fall mechanics in WoW are percentage 
based on a character’s statistics. There 
exist “lethal” falls regardless of the 
character’s relative power in combat.
