Story vs. Narrative 

Story – A series of events as seen from the author’s perspective 

Narrative – personal experiences surrounding such occurrences (whether 
author’s, character’s, player’s, or someone else’s) 

Train going through a tunnel as opposed to Train in the open 

Theater Feature in Halo 3 – demonstrates 

inherent difference between the two

Co-Authorship in Games


-Game Designers create gameplay spaces – as described earlier 
-Player has flexibility to finish story by choosing single path within many available 
-Gravity Gun

Agency in Linear FPS


•  Agency – Power to accomplish expected result with given action 
–  Not necessarily ability to alter grand scheme/direction of game 
•	 Linear plot progression 
–	 Player somewhat limited by designer’s plot (more formal constraints) 
–	 Alignment of player desire and narrative limits required 
In a game with a linear plot, player agency becomes a short term 
version with an emphasis on material constraints. 
–	 Short term – actions have immediate effects 
–	 Material Constraints – determine what actions are possible 

•

Replayability of Games


•	

•	 Mateas and Stern – agency cannot be achieved when 
watching/playing a game for the second time (unrealistic formal 
constraints) 
In terms of player’s narrative, it is nearly impossible to play the same 
game twice. Games with branching plots present so many different 
possibilities that they constitute separate games. I will try to apply 
Mateas and Stern to a linear FPS. 
•	 Agency – more fully achieved on the second playthrough 
–	 Better understanding of material constraints (abilities and puzzles) 
–	 Formal Constraints – not a major factor for agency in this case

Games vs. Other Media


Importance of the player is paramount. This motivation 
distinguishes games. At every step of the game, the player 
is involved, whether  consciously or not. 
-Design – Player agency as driving factor 
-Story – Player dictates as much as writer 
-Success – Players choose to buy or not (Steam) 
-Game itself – by definition, player’s motivations for 
playing determine if the game is actually a game

Conclusion


•	 Games in the Half-Life Series provide model examples 
of Jenkins’ embedded and enacted narratives. 
•	 The difference between story in other media and 
narrative in games gives players the flexibility to co-
author the game along with the designers. 
•	 As a result, agency in Half-Life and other linear games is 
achieved in the short term with an emphasis on material 
constraints. 
•	 The importance of co-authorship and agency in game 
design underscores the fundamental importance of the 
player to games themselves.
