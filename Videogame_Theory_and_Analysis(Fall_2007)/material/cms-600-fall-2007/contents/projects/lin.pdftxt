Choosing a Game 

Wii Sports & Guitar Hero III: The Social Gaming Experience 

There  are  two  types  of  games  that  I  enjoy  above  all  others:  games  with  an  engaging 

storyline  and  atmosphere,  great  attention  to  detail  and  solid  gameplay  that  immerse  you  in  its 

world,  and  games  that  are  a  delight  to  play  in  social  settings,  where  you  can  laugh,  cheer  at 

victory, and even groan at defeat along with your friends.  I have very fond memories of playing 

the Zelda  series, God  of War,  and  the  Starcraft  campaigns.   However,  being  immersed  too  long 

in  a  fantasy  world  may  lead  to  drowsiness,  fatigue,  loss  of  contact  with  the  real  world,  and  a 

zombie-like  state,  at  least  for me.   As  such,  I  have  decided  to  focus  on  the  other  kind  of  game  I 

enjoy,  the  social  game.    Of  course,  this  can  also  lead  to  side  effects,  but  I  don’t  think  they  are 

quite  as  bad,  since  you  usually  can’t  get  your  friends  to  play  the  same  game  with  you  for  10 

hours straight. 

For  the  beginning  of  the  semester,  I  have  decided  to  focus  on  a  few  games  that  I  tried  out 

in  the  past:  Wii  Sports  and  Wii  Play.  Although  these  two  games  were  received  with  only 

lukewarm  reviews  by  most  critics  (Wii  Sports  has  a  critic’s  score  of  7.6/10  on  metacritic.com, 

while Wii Play has a critic’s score of  just 5.8/10),  it seems  that  the gamer population holds  these 

games  in  higher  esteem  (Wii  Play  is  rated  6.8/10  among  users,  and  Wii  Sports  rates  at  an 

incredibly high 9.1/10).  There are many casual  (and non-casual) gamers  that enjoy  these games 

not  for  the  fun  provided  in  simulating  another  world,  but  rather  for  the  fun  of  competing  with

your  friends  in  a  social  context  (Poon), which  is one  aspect  that  I  suspect many  game  reviewers 

don’t give enough weight. 

Another  great  aspect  of  the  Wii  gaming  experience  that  I  am  looking  forward  to  is  the 

prospect of actually exercising while gaming.  Of course, this is an idea that is easy to see, but to 

my  surprise  there  have  actually  been  scientific  studies  demonstrating  the  viability  of Wii  Sports 

as  a  form  of  exercise  (Suburbia).    I  don’t  enjoy  exercise  for  its  own  sake,  but  the  prospect  of 

working out while having fun is too enticing to pass up. 

As fun as  the Wii series may be,  there are some foreseeable problems.   Gameplay may not 

last  for 70 hours over  the  course of  this  semester without  it becoming  too  repetitive  (Lau),  and  I 

can only play it at parties and with friends for so long in one semester.  Despite the prevalence of 

the  series  among  casual  gamers,  there  is  no  vibrant,  established  online  community  for  it.   These 

problems can all be  solved with another  social game: Guitar Hero  III.   Many bars are  starting  to 

hold Guitar Hero nights (Robison).  In addition, getting to an expert level of playing ability could 

easily take tens or hundreds of hours of gameplay (Lau), and the community at ScoreHero.com is 

probably  one  of  the  most  passionate  communities  for  any  single  series  of  games.    Many  of 

ScoreHero’s  top-ranking  players  are  known  and  venerated  even  before  their  first  tournament 

appearance, and some have even helped Guitar Hero  III’s developers  test  the game  (ScoreHero). 

ScoreHero  is  a  place where  people  can  brag  about  their  accomplishments,  ask  others  for  guitar-

gaming  advice  and  strategies,  and  even  participate  in  rivalries,  leagues,  and  tournaments. 

Therein  lies another aspect of  the social gaming experience – although I may not be able  to play 

with people online, I can still connect with them in other ways. 

I’ve played a  few hours of Guitar Hero  I and II before, but not enough  to even get good at 

medium level difficulty.  However, I am very excited about the third game in this series for quite

a  few  reasons.    I’m  psyched  about  Battle Mode,  a  new multiplayer mode  in which  a  player  can 

earn  power-ups  that  are  used  to  attack  the  opponent.    This  not  only  introduces  new  gameplay 

elements  such as double notes,  lefty  flip and blurry  fretboard, but also  levels  the playing  field  to 

a  certain  degree,  allowing  less-skilled  players  a  chance  to  attack  and  beat  more-skilled  ones 

(GamePro).  Career play even features boss battles against the likes of Slash and Tom Morello to 

make  the  single-player  mode  more  interesting.    Compared  to  the  40+  songs  of  the  previous 

game,  Guitar  Hero  III  features  70+  songs;  some  of  these  are  among  my  all-time  favorites,  i.e. 

“Barracuda”, “Cherub Rock”, and “Even Flow” (Wikipedia).   

At  first  glance,  the Wii  series may  seem  like  totally  different  games  from  the Guitar Hero 

series.  However,  they  share  many  similarities.    Although  they  can  be  played  by  oneself  for 

enjoyment, I believe that at the core they are also social games.  Of course, I look forward to the 

fun of  just practicing and becoming more skilled for my own enjoyment, but I also  look forward 

to  the  fun of  competing with others,  talking about  it with others, even  just watching others play. 

Maybe  one  day  I’ll  even  be  good  enough  to  win  some  competitions,  and  I’ll  have  this  class  to 

thank.
