Choosing a Game 

Out of the many strategy PC games that populate physical store shelves around 

the globe and the digital shelves of the internet, the Civilization series is considered one 

of the pioneers of the genre (Bates 57).  According to Edwards’ “History of Civilization”, 

the first game in the series, Civilization, was released in 1991 despite the fact that its 

publisher, Microprose, had pushed back continually on the project because of the 

revolutionary nature of the game with respect to other strategy games of its day.  Since I 

didn’t happen to have any of the revolutionary series on my personal bookshelf, I decided 

it was time to go out and grab myself a copy of Civilization III and Civilization IV.  If 

time allows, I may also try to get a copy of Civilization and Civilization I so I can 

compare the entire series, but since each play-session can take quite a few hours, I’m 

sticking to the most recent two for the time being. 

The main reason I will be looking at multiple Civ games and not just one is 

because I’m interested in seeing the changes, mainly in design, that happen between a 

series of games that still maintains much of it’s core material from installment to 

installment as opposed to some series of games like the Zelda series that, although they 

keep pretty much the same hero and have similar storylines (i.e. save the princess/save 

the world), changes areas, worlds, temples, etc.  In essence, I’m interested in the 

“substance” of the game design mentioned by Sylvester as a crucial reason for the 

success of the game year after year and the chances it has undergone.  Another reason I 

was interested in this series was simply because I’ve heard that it’s good.  Not only have I

had good reports from friends over the past couple of years, but the series has continually 

received high reader and press ratings (usually around 9/10) from IGN as well as 

GameSpot. 

I’ve already found out about a few changes that I should be on the lookout from 

some friends who are fans of the series as well as from online reviews.  The AI in 

Civilization IV has apparently been tweaked to deal with a few inconsistencies that were 

apparent in Civilization III (Rogosic; Tait; Gerbil; GameSpot).  One of the funniest things 

I’ve been told by my friend John Rogosic to look for is the ability to take advantage of a 

quirk in Civ III’s AI by using tons of units to make, in essence, a living wall between 

other civilizations.  Apparently a certain aspect of the AI in Civ III, but not in Civ IV, 

makes it impossible for the units to move around other units under certain conditions, so 

if you make enough units you can create your own wall (Rogosic).  There was a general 

consensus among the people that I talked to, and among the reviews that I looked at, that 

the AI was improved from Civ III to Civ IV (Rogosic; Tait; Video Rev. of Civilization 

IV).  Two other examples would be that the traits of individual units have been changed 

(can now get unit upgrades) and the moods of the leaders of the computer controlled 

characters is more complex and harder to manipulate (Rogosic; Tait; Video Rev. of 

Civilization IV).  Another improved aspect of the game that my friend, Ryan Tait, was 

particularly excited about was the improvement of the cultural boundary that was first 

introduced in Civilization III.  Another set of changes that could be interesting design-

wise are the changes to the UI.  Demonic Gerbil’s review on GameFAQs notes the 

streamlining of the UI for Civilization IV was one of its major advantages.

Obviously the changes noted above are not the only changes that occurred 

between the two editions so I’m sure I’ll find plenty more to amuse myself with.  

However, I can honestly say I’m going to have fun trying out John’s human-wall 

technique.
