Frasca discusses the structures of representation (narratives) and simulation (games) as 
different, but equal, forms of expression. Both may express the views of their authors, but 
while narratives are predetermined and only express a series of events, simulations have 
multiple outcomes and can convey cause and effect to the user. 
 
Games communicate via rules and goals, in addition to the mere representation of events. 
Unlike traditional narrative, games have multiple possible outcomes; a game must be 
played multiple times for the player to completely receive the "narrauthor's" message. 
Thus, there is no inherent problem with sacrificing closure for freedom. 
 
Frasca uses the study of ludology to argue that video games provide the user with 
simulation, which cannot be found in any other form of media.  Additionally, video 
games contain all the basic mechanisms and elements of narrative that are found in 
traditional games and media as well.
