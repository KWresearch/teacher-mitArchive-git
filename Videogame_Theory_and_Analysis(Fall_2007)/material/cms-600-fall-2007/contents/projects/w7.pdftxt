Jenkins claims that “Environmental Storytelling” resolves the conflict between 
interactivity and narrative in games. Interactive spaces can 1) evoke familiar narratives, 
2) hide clues to a narrative, 3) require the player to reach certain narrative plot points, 
and/or 4) allow players to construct their own narratives. 
 
Playing a game is akin to exploring a space in which stories can be enacted, unearthed, or 
newly created. A well-designed space can evoke emotion, suggest the past without using 
flashbacks, and invite the player to explore the narrative possibilities available. 
 
Jenkins discusses the role game designers play in creating a game’s narrative.  He argues 
that one of the most important, and at times difficult, aspects is creating an environmental 
space in which the game’s primary narrative and interactivity can best be exposed to the 
user.
