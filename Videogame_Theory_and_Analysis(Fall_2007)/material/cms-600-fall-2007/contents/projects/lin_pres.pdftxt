Simulation and Narratives


Guitar Hero III – Career Mode 
Go from venue to venue, play sets, earn money 
to buy instruments/characters/etc. 
“The band starts out as a neighborhood sensation, before hooking up with a record 
producer named Lou at one of their shows. After a successful music video hits the web, the 
band travels to England, and then performs at an island jail (despite Lou encouraging them 
to 'sell out'), which ends up boosting the band's popularity. As a result, they are invited to 
headline the Desert Rock Tour festival. After a botched performance in Japan (thanks to 
Lou) they attempt to break free of their contract with Lou, who then reveals himself to be 
the Devil and the contract as ownership of their souls. The band is dragged down to Lou's 
"Inferno", where the final showdown comes. In this final showdown, the player must defeat 
Lou in a boss battle to earn back the band's souls, and the title of ‘Guitar Legend’.” 1
