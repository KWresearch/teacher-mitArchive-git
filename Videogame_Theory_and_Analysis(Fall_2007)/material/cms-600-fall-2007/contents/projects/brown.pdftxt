CMS.600 Fall 2007 
“Choosing a Game” Assignment 
Tom Brown 
 

I would like to investigate Bungie’s Halo series for my game choice. In particular 
I am interested in Halo 3, a game projected to break the 1.5 million presale record that 
Halo 2 set three years ago. Halo interests me because of the massive following it has 
gained. Microsoft sold 2.38 million units of Halo 2 on its opening weekend, yielding a 
gross of over $125 million on its premiere day, making it not only the fastest selling 
video game of all time, but the fastest selling media product (Thorsen). Not only did Halo 
2 come out of the gate strong, but it proved it has lasting power, remaining one of the 
most popular Xbox live games to this day; as of May 2007, over 500 million games of 
Halo 2 had been played on Xbox live ( Zaharov-Reutt)(Brightman). In addition to the 
huge online gaming community, the Halo series has generated spin-offs including books, 
a forthcoming RTS, a possible movie, and Red vs. Blue, a fan-made series using the Halo 
engine, with over 100 episodes created.  
My first interaction with Halo was six years ago. The original game was released 
on November 15th, when I was a freshman in high school. My friend Paolo Menuez got it 
for Christmas and invited me over to play. The next two days we subsisted on kool-aid 
and grilled cheese sandwiches, while we plowed our way through the co-operative game 
on legendary mode. What made the experience great was that we both learned the game 
together as we played the two-player co-op. As each of us learned the ropes, we began to 
trust one another to man the enormous gatling gun mounted on the back of the Warthog, 
or to drive the massive Scorpion tank without crushing friendly troops. By the end of the 
15 or so hours of gameplay in campaign mode (Menuez), we were ready to play versus.  
 
Multiplayer Halo ended up more interesting than anyone could have imagined 
(Menuez)(Syverud). With the potential for large, sixteen player games, and team based 
competitions, Halo was very addictive. Although I have never played any of the series on 
Xbox live, I plan on trying it out, and looking at the interactions between the players 
online. I would like to learn about what it is that makes Halo’s multiplayer so riveting,

why it is that people need to play thousands of hours playing online, and what Bungie has 
tweaked in Halo 3 to make it the “perfect” first person shooter.
