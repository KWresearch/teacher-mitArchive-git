Formal & Material Constraints


•  Formal Constraints 
–  Game elements that convey author’s  intended story 

•  Material Constraints 
–  Anything players are able  to control 

•  Agency & Immersion 
–  When players use material constraints  to produce 
story, optimally one that matches formal constraints 
–  Balance of formal & material  lead to  immersion and 
agency

•	 Custom design only on 
superficial  level 
•	 No actual effect ­>  lack of 
agency 

•	 Most  time spent  in 
dreaded workshop 
•  Complexity doesn’t

increase with play

•	 Gets old  fast,  like  the 
music

Reasons for Shortcomings 

•  Unbalanced formal & material constraints

– Formal: renovate rundown  town 
– Material: move  in sims, build stuff 
– The extent of how you build stuff doesn’t

matter  to the game, only that you do  it.

– Agency  lost b/c material constraints don’t 
align with  formal constraints. 
– “Looks  like a danceclub, but doesn’t act  like 
one.”

Summary


•  The Sims 2 
– Able  to create and operate sims  in 
environments  that change dynamically with 
input 
– Formal and material constraints afford agency 
and allow  for  interactive experience 

•  MySims 
– Material constraints misaligned with  formal – 
game  is unresponsive  to user  input 
– Agency  is  lost
