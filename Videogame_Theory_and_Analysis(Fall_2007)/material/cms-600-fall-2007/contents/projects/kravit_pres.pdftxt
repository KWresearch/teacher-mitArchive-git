Design Spaces

•  Henry Jenkins 
•  “Environmental Storytelling” 
–  Narrative v. Interactivity 
–  Evoke, Enact, Embed, Emerge 
•  In BioShock, design provides basis 
•  User chooses to ﬁnish what designer started

–  Multiple Endings 
–  Diﬀerent Choices

Agency 
•  Theorized by Mateas & Stern 
•  Ability to aﬀect narrative on their own

•  In BioShock 
– Harvesting 
– Plasmids 
– Hacking 
•  Intersects with Design Space of Game

Design Space

•	 Number of unique characteristics 
–	 No consequence for dying 
•	 Overarching sense of fear 
•	 Interactive part of game 
–	 Learning which route is better 
–	 Learning about harvesting 
–	 Learning which plasmids to store 
–	 Learning within game & about game design spaces in general 
terms 
•	 Design Space contributes to learning process

–	 Rescue Little Sisters (promised ADAM in end) 
–	 Harvest Little Sisters (receive ADAM now) 
–	 Moral ambiguity 
–	 Game ambiguity 
•	 Other examples 
•	 Learn & Discover how elements of Design Space lead to 
Agency and Overall Understanding of BioShock
