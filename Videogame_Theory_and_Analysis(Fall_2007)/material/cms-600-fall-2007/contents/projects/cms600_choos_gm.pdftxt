Choosing a Game 
Due: 9/16/07. 

For your first assignment, I’d like you to choose the game you’ll play this semester. It can be a PC or 
console game, but it must be a contemporary commercial videogame, the kind you could buy at a game 
store today. 

But before you choose your game, I’d like you to do a little research and then report to the class some 
thoughts on what the research told you, why you valued the sources you chose, and why you chose the 
game you did. Then, I’d like you to hand in some notes stating what you hope to learn, accomplish, or 
achieve by playing your game. Please hand in these short notes as a post on the discussion board of the 
class website. 

You are encouraged to choose a game that you think will be satisfying and motivating, but it MUST be a 
game that’s NEW to you. In other words, if you’re already a World of Warcraft player, you can’t just re-
roll. You need to choose a new MMO or a different genre of game altogether. 

Because you will be expected to complete a minimum of 70 hours of play this semester, you may choose 
to complete several games in the same genre (horror, for example), a series (Half Life or Halo), or a game 
that’s been ported to different formats or consoles (Zelda). 

For your research, you are required to consult the following sources. At minimum: 

•  TWO human beings (can be cited as “personal interviews”) 

•  THREE online sources 

•  ONE print source 

•  ONE “other” your choice
