Game Selection 

Playing Evil 
When it comes to playing games, most often the character is cast as a hero.  As Ryan 

Davis of Gamespot says, “There are plenty of games that make you choose between 

good and evil…  [However] There are very few games that focus entirely on the evil.”  

For this semester, I’ve chosen to choose games that focus almost exclusively on the evil. 

The source of the inspiration for this gameplay plan was the game Evil Genius by Elixir 

Studios.  It’s a campy take on the 1960’s spy film, casting you as an Evil Genius.  The 

game is based mostly around base building, but has a variety of “Acts of Infamy” which 

are enacted on the unsuspecting world.  You kidnap, plunder, and steal your way to 

notoriety.  Although Evil Genius is a fairly long game, it was necessary to locate other 

games of evil. 

The first suggestion and the newest game in my playlist was Overlord.  It was first 

suggested by Chris when discussing the games to play for this class.  He suggested 

Overlord as an obvious example of playing evil.  Ryan Davis of Gamespot agrees, as 

seen in the opening paragraph.  The game casts you as an evil overlord, returning to 

power after being defeated. 

To ensure that I had enough games, I went looking for other games.  In this case, it was 

already becoming somewhat difficult to find only evil games, so I started looking for 

games that give you choices.  The first game, suggested by Alex was Black & White 2. 

It’s a god game, casting you in the role of a Greek deity.  According to Jason Ocampo

of Gamespot, “Black and White 2 takes its name from the fact that you can be as good 

or as evil a god you want to be.”  In this case, my playthrough will be focused on 

creating a malevolent diety, rather than a benevolent one. 

Despite already having three games selected, to ensure that I would be able to play 

the required 70 hours, I went looking for a fourth.  Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The 

Sith Lords came up as a game that offers the player a choice.  According to Metacritc, “players 

must explore and battle through seven diverse worlds while being challenged whether 

to choose the light side of the Force or surrender to the lure of the dark side.”  Again, 

my playthrough will then focus on the dark side of the game, and creating an evil 

character, rather than the light side. 

Overall, Evil Genius is my main focus, due to it being a fairly long, complex game, and 

being one which I have played some of, but never actually completed.  I may actually 

decide to modify the game slightly to aid in my playthrough, either using a fan made 

“patch” or modifying the game slightly to suit my play.  Overlord will be second priority, 

with Black & White 2 and KotOR 2 being the lowest priority to get to.
