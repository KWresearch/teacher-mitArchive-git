Categorizing RTS Games


Choosing  a Game  –  CMS.998  Fall  2007 

John  Lee


September  16,  2007 


The  modern  Real-Time  Strategy  (RTS)  gaming  community  is  a  broad  one  thanks 

to  the  wide-ranging  diversity  of  commercial  RTS  games  in  stores  today.  Although  these 

games generally all  share  the  common  characteristic  that  they give players direct  control over 

units  and  a  simple  goal  (destroy  your  opponent),  the  means  of  achieving  this  goal  varies 

widely  across  games.  In  this  paper,  I  discuss  how  an  RTS  game  is  aﬀected  by  particular 

strategic game  elements,  and propose  that analyzing  these variations  can  lead  to a useful way 

of  subcategorizing  games  of  this  genre.  I  intend  to  do  this  analysis  in  the  Battle  for  Midd le 

Earth  series,  while  also  drawing  on  my  experience  with  other  RTS  games  (the  Warcraft, 

Starcraft,  and  Command  and  Conquer  series). 

Keith  Co  (2007)  identiﬁed  a  series  of  inﬂuential  RTS  games  that  revolutionized  and 

greatly  contributed  to  the  evolution  of  the  genre.  The  particular  contributions  he  identiﬁes 

almost all involve certain strategic gameplay elements – rules – deﬁned by the game developers 

that are intended to directly aﬀect the way a player tries to accomplish his goals.  For instance, 

Warcraft  II  introduced  fog  of  war,  which  grants  a  player  vision  of  an  area  only  if  units  are 

present  there;  the  Blizzard  RTS  games  and  the  Age  of  Empires  series  explored  the  use  of 

multiple  types  of  gatherable  resources;  Total  Annihilation  featured  persistent,  or  hero  units.

All  of  these  game  features  are  intended  to  directly  aﬀect  the  way  the  game  is  played:  fog 

of  war  forces  a  player  to  scout,  diverse  resource  types  present  players  with  worker  allocation 

decisions, and non-expendable hero units must be kept under close watch.  Strategic gameplay 

elements  are  associated  with  particular  tasks  given  to  the  player.  During  the  semester,  I 

intend  to  classify  these  game  features  based  on  the  kind  of  task  they  demand  from  the  player 

in  order  to  help  identify  sub-categories  of  the  RTS  genre. 

While  it  is  clear  that  the  RTS  genre  has  evolved  greatly  since  its  inception,  whether 

the  new  “revolutionary”  features  add  depth  to  the  game  can  be  questionable  (Adams  2004). 

The  Battle  for  Midd le  Earth  series  has  been  described  as  an  “RTS  for  noobs”  and  created 

only  to  cater  to  fans  of  the  Lord  of  the  Rings  story  line  and  not RTS  gamers  (Wissner-Gross, 

2007).  The  game  features  a  very  simple  economic  model:  farms  automatically  add  resources 

(of  which  there  is  only  one  type)  over  time,  and  combat  units  will  automatically  manage 

themselves  with  no  user  intervention.  Perhaps  it  was  the  intent  of  the  developers  to  try  to 

shift  the  focus  of  the  player  away  from  tedious  details  that  require  fast  hands,  and  toward 

strategy  and  build  choices.  In  my  local  gaming  community,  there  is  a  clear  divide  in  RTS 

preference:  some  gamers  prefer  the  faster-paced  games  requiring  signiﬁcant multitasking  and 

others prefer games like Battle  for Midd le Earth, but none like both (Bhat; Chang; Liu; Misra; 

Wissner-Gross 2007).  It will be  interesting  to  investigate what properties of a game’s  features 

would  lead  certain  players  to  prefer  it. 

Wissner-Gross  said  that  he  plays  the  game  because  it  is  easier  than  other RTS  games; 

perhaps  this  is  in  line  with  the  generally  observed  trend  that  games  are  getting  easier  in 

order  to  appeal  to  broader  audiences  (Raby  2005).  The  trend  for  users  wanting  easier  games 

is  exempliﬁed  by  the  ever-present  collection  of  hacks,  cheats,  and  other  external  programs

designed  to  give  the  player  an  edge  (Hoglund  &  McGraw  2007).  However,  I  believe  that 

classifying RTS games  is not as  simple as being  easy or hard,  or  requiring  fast multitasking.  I 

intend to play Battle  for Midd le Earth while comparing its features to other RTS games I have 

had  experience  with,  and  identifying  the  strategic  game  elements  that  make  them  diﬀerent 

and  appeal  to  diﬀerent  people.
