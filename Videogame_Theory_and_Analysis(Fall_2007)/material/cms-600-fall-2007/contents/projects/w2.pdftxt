Play happens and is studied in many contexts thanks to its wide-ranging diversity both in 
time and space. Sutton-Smith addresses this ambiguity by suggesting that we discuss play 
in terms of why we do it -- be it from the theorist's or player's point-of-view -- rather than 
trying to formulate strict definitions. 
 
Sutton-Smith uses forty-eight various forms and phrases of “play” in his essay. The 
proliferation of this word emphasizes the ambiguity inherent to modern interpretations of 
play. As explanation, he offers seven rhetorics, differing views of play’s value in society, 
and examines the interplay of play and rhetoric with each other.   
 
"Play": diverse experiences, scholarly perspectives. 
 
Rhetorics: persuasive approaches to discussing play's purpose, cultural context. 
 
Ancient 
Fate: cf. "alea" 
Power: Symbolic conflict. 
Identity: Solidifies community. 
Frivolous: Tricksters, fools. 
 
Modern 
Progress: Animals, children. Development, not enjoyment. 
Imaginary: Creativity, improvisation. 
Self: Intrinsically satisfying escapism. 
 
Each corresponds to specific advocates, games, players, theories. 
 
Brian Sutton-Smith attempts to show the reader how different societies relate to different 
forms of “play.”  These different types exhibit themselves in their style and “rhetoric,” 
but closely follow the seven most common theories, each validating themselves as a form 
of play. 
 
In this introductory essay concerning theories on the Purpose of play, Brian Sutton-Smith 
outlines the seven most common theories, and concludes that each theory validates a type 
of play, but that the Purpose is ambiguous because of competing “rhetorics” that may not 
agree with the opinions of the players.
