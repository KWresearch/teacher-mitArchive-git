Henry Jenkins on Games and

Narrative


“In this short piece, I hope to offer a middle 
ground position ... one that respects the 
particularity of this emerging medium— 
examining games less as stories than as
spaces ripe with narrative possibility”

What the Heck does he mean?


●	 Games do not need  or necessarily have a 
story 
●	 Games can  tell a story by utilizing spacial 
design 
–	 Evocative Spaces 
–	 Enacting Stories 
–	 Embedded Narrative

Enacting Stories


“Spacial stories are held together by broadly 
defined goals and conflicts and pushed 
forward by the character's movement
across the map” 

●  Straightforward Narrative 
●  Short and Long Term Goals 
●  'Accordion'

Enacting Stories 

“The organization of the plot becomes a 
matter of designing the geography of
imaginary worlds, so that obstacles thwart
and accordances facilitate the 
protagonist's forward movement towards 
resolution” 

●

	 Example:  Poisoning of Doma 
●	 Long-Term goal:  Defeat Empire 
●	 Short-Term goal:  Reunite at Narshe 
●	 Obstacles:  Swept off of raft 
●	 Accordances:  There is another path to  

Narshe through the Imperial camp

Embedded Narrative 
“Narrative comprehension is an active 
process by which viewers assemble 
and make hypothesis about likely 
narrative developments on the basis of 
information drawn from textual cues 
and clues” 
●	 Embed the narrative within the space 
itself 
●	 Two Narratives 
●	 Rule of the 3 
●	 Example: Dreams 1, and 2

storytelling techniques 
●	 Final Fantasy III utilizes embedded 
narrative to extend the game beyond the 
main plot
