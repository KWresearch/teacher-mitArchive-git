I have decided to play a small collection of games from the horror
shooter genre. These games include F.E.A.R. (PC), BioShock (PC), and
Resident Evil 1 (GCN). Out of these, I plan to focus mostly on F.E.A.R.
I remember seeing great reviews for this game when it first came out
(McNamara) and I have wanted to play it since then, but have never
gotten around to it. 
The main reason this game came to mind is that I will be UROPing for
one of the programmers for this game. His name is Jeff Orkin and he was
the Senior Software Engineer in charge of the Artificial Intelligence.
I find AI in video games extremely interesting and I think I will be
able to learn a lot about that kind of stuff in F.E.A.R. It's also nice 
to have personal contact with someone who will be able to answer many
of my questions (Orkin). I actually think that Oblivion would be
another great game to examine because of its amazing AI system, but
I've already poured far too many hours into that game. 
Another appealing aspect to F.E.A.R. is that it seems to have a bit of
a community built up around it. From what I can tell, this is mostly
driven by Sierra (the game's publisher) and may appear to be bigger
than it actually is, but that could also be something interesting to
examine. There are a couple forums that I will probably be able to look
through to find out more about the community (Sierra, Project Origin).
There's also a section of a fan site (hosted by Sierra) that has links
to Fan Fiction, Fan Videos, and Fan Art (FEAR Community Content).
Machinima.com even has a channel for machinima made from FEAR 
(Machinima.com). The community may not be the biggest, but it
definitely exists. 
Another thing I learned about this game was that it may not be the
longest game and that I will probably finish it in under 20 hours
(McNamara, Grabenstein). To fix this problem, I decided to expand my
choices to include other games in the horror shooter genre. I haven't
played very many  games of this genre, but I know there are a lot of
great ones. Under the advice of a friend (and after an offer of one of
his installs), I decided to try BioShock (Grabenstein). There has been
a lot of talk about how good this game is and I would like to have the
chance to find out for myself. 
The other game I decided to throw into the mix is Resident Evil. RE is
probably the most famous and popular game in the horror shooter genre
so I obviously couldn't leave it out of my small survey. There is also
a pretty big community surrounding these games that I may be able to
compare to FEAR's. I have decided to play Resident Evil 1 for Gamecube
because it's the first of the series and I wanted to start from the 
beginning and because I have a Gamecube available to me. It would be
nice to play the original Playstation version, but the Gamecube one is
what I'm going to have to stick to.
