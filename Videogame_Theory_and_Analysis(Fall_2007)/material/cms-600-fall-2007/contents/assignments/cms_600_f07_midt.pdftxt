Midterm Exam

Each question  is worth 10 poin ts. You may modify one question, but keep it reasonable.


1.	 As part of our in-class “What is a Game?” discussions surrounding the Caillois text, we made 
attempts to sort out the differences among four key terms DIFFERENT from Caillois’ terms. 
What were those terms? In your opinion, which is most  important? 

2.	 What does Caillois mean by “paidea” and “ludus?” Compare them with the terms “narratology” 
and “ludology.” 

3.	 What does Brian Sutton-Smith mean by the “ambiguity of play?” If you were talking with Sutton-
Smith, how would you describe the “ambiguities of play” with regard to the game you are playing 
for class? 

4.	 How does Stephen Sniderman feel about game rules? Contrast his view with Mateas & Stern’s 
view of interactivity OR Frasca’s concept of ludology. On which points would they agree or 
disagree? 

5.	 Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern discuss gameplay  in terms of material and formal constraints. 
What are the material and formal constraints of the game you are playing? In your opinion, do 
these constraints combine to create a sense of agency on the part of the player? 

6.	

In Lucasfilm 's Habitat, the character Death was  twice k illed. The situation was handled 
differently each time. Which did Farmer and Morningstar argue was more effective? Why? 

7.	 According to Gonzalo Frasca, what is the difference between simulation and narrative? Which  is 
more important in his view? Why? 

8.	 Hen ry Jenkins argues that game designers can be viewed as “narrative architects.” Paraphrase 
what he means and explain how he would be criticized for being a narratologist and not a 
ludologist. 

9.	 Aside from "programmer,"  "artist," or "player," what are a few different options you have if you 
want  to make games a part of your life after college? Ci te examples from lab. 

10. Briefly summarize a moment from choosing, playing, or studying your game (e.g ., researching 
your character, watching others play, getting stuck). Then, using one or more ideas we have 
discussed in class this semester to explain it. In other words, take something you notice (a data 
point) and use theory  to explain what you noticed, why  it happened, how you can account for it 
happening, etc. Is what you noticed an effect of the design of the game? Of its player community? 
Of the narrative? Explain.
