7.013  Signal Transduction Section 
G proteins are involved in signal transduction in many cell types. In the small intestine, in 
the intestinal epithelial cells, the transport of water through membrane proteins is 
regulated by a G protein. The effect of drugs, and toxins on the G protein can cause 
aberrant conditions in which water and electrolytes leave the underlying blood capillaries, 
going through the epithelial cells and exit into the intestinal tract. This water is 
eliminated by the body in the form of diarrhea. 

a) Vibrio cholerae is a bacterium that one ingests through contaminated woter or food. 
Once swallowed the vibrios swim to the surface of the intestinal epithelium where they 
colonize. Upon colonization, the bacteria elaborate cholera toxin. The toxin is transported 
across the epithelial cell plasma membrane into the cytoplasm, where the toxin proceeds 
to irreversibly modify the Gα subunit of the G protein. This modified Gα subunit 
continues to stimulate adenylate cyclase. The result of cholera toxin is a sudden and 
severe (and fatal if not treated) diarrhea, where a person can lose all fluids (and lots of 
electrolytes) from their body in less than 24 hours. Death is due to severe dehydration 
and shock. 

i) What function of Gα subunit is altered by cholera toxin so that adenylate cyclase is 
always active? 

ii) What would be the effect of cholera toxin on cAMP levels in the intestinal epithelial 
cells? 

iii) Can you suggest a mechanism for how cAMP may function in intestinal cells to result 
in massive diarrhea? 

b) An analogue of GTP, called GTP-γS, when bound to the G protein, cannot be hydrolyzed 
to GDP. 

i) If GTP-γS is fed to an individual, what would its effect on the intestinal epithelial 
cells? 

ii) Would you expect the effects of GTP-γS to be limited to the intestinal epithelial 
cells? 

c) What are the 3 key attributes, as taught by Professor Jacks, concerning signal 
transduction?
