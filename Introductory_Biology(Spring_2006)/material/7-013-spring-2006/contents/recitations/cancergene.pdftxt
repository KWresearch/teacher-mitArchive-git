7.013 Section problem: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors 

For the following a-d, state whether the procedure could cause cells to lose growth 
control.  Explain your reasoning. 

a) A copy of the activated ras oncogene isolated from a tumor is introduced into a 
cell that carries two normal copies of the ras proto-oncogene. 

b) A copy of the mutant Rb tumor suppressor gene is introduced into a cell carrying 
two normal copies of the Rbgene. 

c) A copy of the gene for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that encodes a 
mutant, constitutively active receptor is introduced into a cell that carries two 
normal copies of the EGFR gene. 

d) A normal erythropoietin (epo) cDNA (encodes a growth factor for erythroid stem 
cells) attached to a constitutive promoter is introduced into an erythroid stem cell 
that carries two normal copies of the erythropoietin gene. 

e) Would introduction of a normal copy of the Rb gene into a retinoblast cell that 
was Rb+/Rb- alter the probability of the cell becoming a tumor cell? Explain.
