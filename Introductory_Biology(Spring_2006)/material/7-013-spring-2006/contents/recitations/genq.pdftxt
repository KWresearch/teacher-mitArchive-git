36 red-eyed 

gives F2:	
13 white-eyed 


b) 

cross 1: long-eared mouse ____________  X  short-eared mouse ____________ 
12  long-eared 

gives F1:

gives F1: 	
cross 2: pale-blue F1  X pale-blue F1 
27 blue

gives F2:	
49 pale-blue

24 white


Blood Type 
cross 1: person, type A blood ____________  X  person with type B ____________
