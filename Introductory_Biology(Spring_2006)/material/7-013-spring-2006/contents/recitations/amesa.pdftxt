Ames Test  - Section 
The Ames test is commonly used as an efficient and inexpensive test for the mutagenic property 
of substances.  Bacteria that are deficient in histidine biosynthesis (His-) are spread on solid agar 
containing inorganic salts and sugars (minimal medium).  Minimal medium does not contain the 
amino acid histidine or any other amino acid supplements. On minimal medium, the his- bacteria 
will not grow unless they undergo a reversion mutation.  In the Ames test, His- bacteria are mixed 
with a substance and spread on minimal medium (plated).  If the substance is mutagenic, some of 
the bacteria will undergo a reversion mutation and be able to grow in the absence of histidine. If 
the chemical is not mutagenic then the bacteria will not grow. 

When a bacterial strain deficient in histidine biosynthesis (His-), is plated for confluent 
growth (about 1 X1 0 6) on minimal medium  (containing only inorganic salts and sugar), it 
does not grow (See below). However, the bacteria grow when plated coated with a 
mystery substance on minimal medium (substances #1 and #2.) 

RICH MEDIUM

 MINIMAL MEDIUM 

MIN + ? #1 

MIN +? #2 

a) Why did we plate on rich medium and minimal medium with no additions?What are these called? 

Controls 

b) What are two possibilities for the identities of the mystery substances?
 
Indicate which type of mystery substance corresponds with the growth on each plate.
 
The mystery substance could either be histidine itself (or something containing histidine), or a mutagen.  If
 
you add histidine itself, then all of the bacteria plated should grow #2). If a mutagen is added, then only a
 
subset of the bacteria, those in which a reversion mutation hasoccurred, will grow (#1).
 

c) You perform a series of experiments in which you plate proteins purified from 
soybeans along with the His- bacteria on minimal medium.  You find that the bacteria 
confluently grow on almost all of the plates. Does this mean that soybean proteins are 
mutagens, or could there be another explanation? 

Most proteins contain histidine. When these proteins are broken down, they can be a source of histidine, 
thereby enabling the bacteria to grow. 

d) If the mystery substance #1 is a mutagen, how would that enable the bacteria to grow 
in the absence of histidine? 

The mutagen could cause a new mutation in the already mutant allele of the gene encoding the enzyme 
involved in histidine biosynthesis. This mutation could either restore wildtype sequence or make a 
compensating change (addition of the right number of basepairs to restore frame, or change a second 
basepair to restore the amino acid encoded). By “fixing” the gene, the mutation will also fix the protein 
product, and thus restore the phenotype to wildtype. 

e) In this next experiment you have two bacterial strains that are deficient in histidine 
biosynthesis.  One has a single base-pair substitution (Strain A) and the other has a frameshift 
(deletion) mutation (Strain B). You isolate the mutant histidine biosynthesis enzyme from Strain 
A and find that it differs from wildtype at only one amino acid.  You isolate the mutant histidine 
biosynthesis enzyme from strain B and find that it is nearly full length, but only the first 50 
amino acids are wildtype. You plate each strain either alone, with the addition of histidine, or with 
the addition of either drug X or drug Z. You then examine plates 1-8. The results are summarized 
below. 

There are two mutagenic drugs used. 
One drug causes the replacement of a G-C pair with an A-T pair. 
The other drug causes the insertion or deletion of a single base-pair. 
Examples of mutagenic drugs: 

Ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS),  GCAT transitions 
Nitrosoguanidine (NG), GCAT transitions 
Proflavin – intercalating  agent  frameshift 
Acridine orange – intercalating  agent  frameshift 
ICR-191 – intercalating  agent  frameshift

Explain why drug X enables strain A to grow on minimal medium, but does not have the 
same effect on strain B? Explain why drug Z enables strain B to grow on minimal medium, 
but does not have this effect on strain A? 

Strain A has a point mutation (single base-pair substitution) and strain B has a frameshift mutation (either deletion or 
insertion of base-pair(s)). Therefore drug X is likely to cause single base-pair substitution mutations and restore the 
wildtype sequence in strain A, thus allowing it to synthesize histidine. Drug Z causes the insertion or deletion of base-
pairs and therefore will restore the reading frame in strain B (but not necessarily make the whole protein wildtype), 
thus allowing it to synthesize histidine. 

f) If you examine many control plates (lacking histidine and without the addition of a drug – minimal plates) 
you find the occasional colony with both strains A and B.  Explain the presence of these colonies. 
Spontaneous reversion mutations will occur at a very low frequency.
