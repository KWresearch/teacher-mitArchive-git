Please refer to...

Lyall, Sarah. Foreign Desk: "Whites Have Black Twins 

in In-Vitro Mix-Up." New York Times, Late Edition - Final,

a) What are all of the possible combinations of parents for the twins? 

b) If DNA technology were not available (if it were 1950, or you were in an under-
equipped lab) what test would you perform to sort out the identity of the twins parents? 
Would this test give you a definitive answer? Why/why not? 

c) What DNA tests could be performed now to determine the identity of the parents? 
Are these assays more or less likely to give definitive results than the test you proposed 
above?  Why/why not?
