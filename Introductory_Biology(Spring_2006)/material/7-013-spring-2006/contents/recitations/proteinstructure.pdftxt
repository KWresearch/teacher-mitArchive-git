S’05 7.013 Section Problem- Enzymes/Protein Structure 

There is a class of related enzymes called serine proteases that all use the same mechanism to 
cleave peptide bonds. Each member of this family cleaves protein substrates at a different 
location – that is, each enzyme cleaves protein substrates after a different specific amino acid. 

Formally, they catalyze the following reaction. 

A-B-C-D-X-E-F-G-H + H2O --------------->A-B-C-D-X 
protein substrate
 protein fragment

+ 

E-F-G-H 
 protein fragment 

Where A through H are any amino acids, and X is one of the specific amino acids uniquely 
recognized by the enzyme. If this process repeats again and again, a large substrate protein will 
be completely degraded into small peptide fragments. 

Each member of the protease family cleaves after a specific amino acid on the substrate because 
that particular amino acid fits in the binding pocket of the protease enzyme. 

a) One of these protease enzymes, trypsin, cleaves after lys or arg. What would be the 
product(s) if each of the following peptide molecules were treated with trypsin? 

i) leu-thr-phe-ala-ser 

ii) trp-tyr-lys-ala-phe 

iii) lys-arg-lys-arg 

The structures of three hypothetical proteases binding pockets are shown below (the actual 
enzyme is much larger than the binding pocket). If the amino acid side chain on the substrate 
binds well to the binding or “recognition pocket” the substrate will bind and subsequently cleaved.

b) The specificity of each protease (the amino acids that it likes to cut after) are listed 
below.  Match the enzyme with the specificity & explain. 
i) lysine, arginine 

ii) phenylalanine,  tryptophan, tyrosine 

iii) glycine, alanine

c) How might you design a similar enzyme to cleave after aspartic acid? 

d) Speculate on the effect of changing the aspartic acid in protease B to a glutamic acid. 

e) There are three amino acids required for the active site to function and three amino 
acids involved in substrate recognition – why then do these enzymes typically contain 
more than 200 amino acids? 

f) Suppose you make a solution of protease A. A small sample taken when the solution was 
made (time = 0) is capable of cleaving 100 mmol of protein substrate per minute. This 
rate of substrate cleavage is called the “activity” of the enzyme. 

At regular intervals over the next few hours as the solution of protease A stands at room 
temperature, you remove small samples and measure the activity (the rate at which a 
substrate protein is cleaved.). 

You find that the activity of the enzyme drops rapidly as time passes. 

However, interestingly, if when you made your solution of protease A, you added a large 
amount of casein (a protein found in milk that has no enzymatic activity), the protease 
loses its activity much more slowly. These data are sketched below:

Explain these observations.

g) If you monitor the reaction of any of these proteases as they degrade a protein, you 
observe that the protease does not cut all the recognition sites in the substrate at once-
the recognition sites on the surface of the substrate protein are the first to be cut. 
Explain. 

h) How might your answer to parts (f) and (g) be combined to design a long lasting 
protease A molecule? 

i) Normally, protease A is synthesized as an inactive precursor, “zymogen A”. Zymogen A 
can be cleaved by protease A to form active protease A. 

catalyzed by protease A 
zymogen A + H2O -----------------------------> protease A + small 
peptide 

(inactive)

 (active) 

Draw a graph of the activity (see part (f)) as a function of time for a solution of zymogen 
A after the addition of a small amount of protease A.
