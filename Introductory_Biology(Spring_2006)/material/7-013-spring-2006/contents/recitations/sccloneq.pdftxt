Stem Cell review/CLONING Section 
A. True/False:  Circle "T" if the statement is true; circle "F" if the statement is false. 

If true, leave the sentence alone.


If false, correct only one of the underlined words to make the statement true.


T/F   A pluripotent cell can give rise to every type of cell. 

T/F  A kidney cell and a muscle cell from your body have different genomes. 

T/F   In humans, most if not all the of the cells in the adult body are stem cells. 

T/F  A fully differentiated cell is more likely to go through mitosis than a stem cell. 

T/F  In a lab, ES cells are extracted from zygotes. 

T/F  For  the  organism,  it  is  more  dangerous  if  a  fully  differentiated  cell  acquires  a 

mutation than a stem cell. 

T/F  Dolly the sheep was cloned from an ES cell. 

B. Circle the statement(s) that correctly complete(s) the sentence.

a) A concern about using a differentiated cell to provide the genome for a human clone is 
that... 

i) each differentiated cell has a different genome, so  it wouldn’t be able  to contribute 

all of the genes necessary to make a human. 

ii) the cell could have acquired de novo mutations that make no difference to the donor, 

but could be detrimental to the emerging clone. 

iii) the resulting cells would be haploid. 


b) When an ES cell is implanted into a recipient blastula, the cells of the resulting animal 

will... 
i) attack each other. 

ii) be a mixed population each having one of two genomes. 
iii) each have a unique genome. 

c) Stem cells from your body can potentially be used to... 

i) re-populate your damaged organs.

ii) grow a pig.


iii) re-populate your friend’s damaged organs.


d)  A  blastula  from  a  pure  breeding  black  mouse  is  injected  with  an  ES  cell  from  a  pure 

breeding tan colored mouse.   The resulting animal may be able to produce offspring such 
that... 

i) all of the offspring are tan colored.

ii) each offspring is part black and part tan colored.


iii) some of the offspring are black and some are tan colored 


C. a) What are two differences between a zygote and a stem cell derived from an adult?

D. When Dolly the sheep was cloned in the 1990’s, it has become apparent that cloning of
mammals is a real possibility.  It has since been found that although cloning is still an 
extremely inefficient procedure, some cell types are better nuclear donors than others. 

Ian Wilmut and colleagues used udder cells for cloning, but before they removed their 
nuclei, they starved them in culture. Depriving donor cells of nutrients is now routinely 
done during cloning of other animals and has shown to be a useful procedure. Briefly 
describe why this is important.

Given what you know about DNA replication, why do telomeres shorten as cells divide?

b) In the distant future, humans will discover the small mammal, Thecheat strongbadius, 
in the last remaining patch of rainforest.  This animal, commonly known as a The Cheat, 
becomes wildly popular as a household pet.  Cheats isolated in the wild have a green coat. 
An industrious pet store owner, who is a molecular biologist on the side, genetically 
engineers a cheat which develops a gold color coat as an adult.  Knowing that this 
particular color of cheat will be extremely popular among his customers, he decides to 
clone the gold cheat. 

Assuming that the principles used to produce the cloned sheep Dolly in the late 20th 
century are still applicable, describe how the pet store owner would clone the gold cheat.

c) While websurfing one night, you come across a provocative website: 
http://www.rael.org 
It’s a group interested in human cloning.


a) You immediately join this group. How much does it cost to join?


Because your 7.013 knowledge, you're chosen not only to be the second human cloned, but 
also to be in charge of your own cloning strategy!! 

b) Outline below the procedure for making your very own clone. 

You make your clone and Rael tells you that the clone is not as genetically identical as it 
might be. 

c) Male Students only: 

i) If you’re male, assuming no mutations occurred in development, why might your clone 
not be identical to you. 

ii) How might you get around this? 

c) Female Students only: 

i) If you’re female, assuming no mutations occurred in development, why might your

clone not be identical to you.


ii) How could you make your clone as genetically similar to you as possible? 

d) One member of your rael clan buddies suggests that the clone be made from your 
mature red blood cells, while another member argues that fibroblast cells would be 
better.  Which cell type would you choose? Why?
