Help! It is a Thursday afternoon, problem sets are due and... 

SOMEONE HAS TAKEN THE WOODEN PROBLEM SET BOX!  Chaos has ensued. Help us  

solve the mystery so we can make sure all the problem sets are collected in a peaceful way. 


THE FACTS:

•	 The problem set box was last seen in the Biology building on Wednesday at 5:00 pm. 
The building was then locked for the night. 
•  TA1, TA2, TA3, TA4, TA5, and TA6 all have a key to the biology building. 
•  Someone took the box and  left the following note: 

Recombinant DNA techniques were used to solve the crime. Two detectives, John and Ted, 
collected cells left on the ransom note and from these cells extracted DNA. The region
encoding gene K was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA sequence of the 
PCR products was then determined by dideoxy DNA sequencing. Shown in the box below are 
the results from the sequencing gel.

a) Write the DNA sequence for this region of gene K as shown in the sequencing gel above. 
Indicate the 5' and 3' ends of the DNA sequence. 

b) One of the suspects, TA6, has the following ds DNA sequence for this same region in 
both copies of gene K: 
5' CTGAAGTACGT 3'

3' GACTTCATGCA 5'

Is TA6 still considered a suspect in the case?  Justify your answer. 

John, the detective analyzed a second site, the gene L locus (represented by the shaded box 
below), which he has shown is useful for forensics. The only difference between the two alleles 
at this locus is that the l allele lacks an internal EcoRI restriction site present in the L  allele.

Ted, the detective, performed PCR analysis of the cells taken from the note and determined 
that the note was was handled only by a Ll individual.  Based on this, the gene L locus of the 
suspects was amplified by PCR, the PCR products were digested with EcoRI, and the resulting
fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis as shown below:

c) In the spaces provided above, indicate the genotypes at the gene L locus for these suspects. 

d) Based on the PCR analysis of the gene L locus, which individual(s) can be excluded as
suspects in the crime?  Justify your answer. 

At chromosomal position Z, it is common to find one or more copies of a 100 bp insert. 
Fortunately, many of the suspects have different number of inserts at this position: 

TA2 has no inserts. 
TA5 has one insert. 
TA3 has two inserts. 
TA4 has three inserts. 
TA1 has four inserts. 
TA6 has two inserts. 
A partial DNA sequence of position Z is given below.  The length of position Z without an insert is
2000 bp. 
[100 bp insert]
....CGACG-3'
5'-GTGCA.... 
n....GCTGC-5' 
3'-CACGT.... 
e) To determine who stole the problem set box, design a PCR-based strategy to analyze 
position Z, including the sequences and orientation (5' and 3' ends) of two 5-base primers 
necessary to PCR amplify this region. 

f) The following pattern was seen on the gel used to separate the PCR products from the 
above  experiment.
