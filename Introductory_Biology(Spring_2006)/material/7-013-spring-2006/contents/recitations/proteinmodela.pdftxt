Protein Shape Game 

Each group has three buckets. Bucket I contains pieces of type I, bucket II—of type II, 
and bucket III—of type III. The goal of this game is to see how many different kinds of 
structures you can build from the pieces in your buckets. Each structure has to contain 
a piece of each type. Please remember that as you put the structures together, the 
color spots have to match up in the following way:

1. 	 How many structures were you able to put together? 
There were 3 complete structures and a piece of type III that did not go 
with any of them. Three other structures can be put together, but they do 
not stay together as well. 

2. 	 Are all your structures identical? If not, what are the differences? 
Two of the structures have identical final complex shape, while the third 
does not. In each complex pieces of types I and II are different than in any 
other complex. 

3. 	 The pieces in your buckets represent three different molecules, that together 
work as a complex in a cell. 
a). What dictates whether the pieces of type I, II, and III can form a complex? 
The complex is put together via three-dimensional shape fitting and 
interactions of the chemical groups on the surface of the molecules. 

Interactions of the chemical groups are encoded in the colors:

Blue and red—charged groups. Blue-red interactions represent ionic bonds.

Black—polar groups. Black-black, black-blue, and black-red interactions

represent hydrogen bonds.

Silver—hydrophobic groups. Silver-silver interactions represent hydrophobic

effect.


The only thing you knew about each piece was its shape and coloring scheme

(chemical properties). You put together complexes because they fit. In a

similar sense, within a cell, two molecules interact because they can. And if


they can, they do. We will return to discussing this point and its implications 
for the rest of this course at the end of the section. 

b). Can all pieces of type I work with all pieces of type II? If not, what are the 
restrictions on the pieces in order for them to work together? 
Each piece of type I only fits perfectly with one piece of type II. The other 
combinations do not work because the shapes of the type I and II pieces do 
not match each other. 

c).What conclusion about molecular interactions can you draw from b)? 
I. Molecular interactions are accomplished by 3D shape fitting and
interactions of the chemical groups on the surface of the molecules. 

II. A change in the shape of a molecule can render it unable to interact with
its binding partners. 

III. A complementary change in the shape of a binding partner molecule can
restore binding (and function). 

4.	 What is a protein? 
A protein is a biological macromolecule composed of one or more chains of 
amino acids in a specific order. 

5.	 What are some of the other types of biological macromolecules in a cell? 
Other types of large molecules are nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), 
carbohydrates, and lipids. 

6.	 What is the connection between these types of molecules in the cell? 
DNA encodes proteins through an RNA intermediate. Some RNAs also 
perform other functions in the cell. Proteins do a lot of different things in 
the cell, including making new DNA, RNA, carbohydrates, and lipids. 

7.	 What are the four levels of protein structure? 
Primary—the sequence of amino acids; secondary—the local secondary 
structure (α−helices and β-sheets); tertiary—three-dimensional structure; 
and quarternary—interactions between 3D structures, such as multiple 
peptides within a protein complex. 

8.  If we consider our models to represent protein molecules, what level of protein 
structure do the models represent? 

Tertiary and quarternary.


9.  What is the first level of protein structure at which a change that led to the 
pieces of the same type having different shapes would have occurred? 
Primary—change in amino acid sequence causes the change in the 3D 
conformation of a protein. 

10. What are some of the different functions of proteins and protein complexes in a 
cell? 

Proteins perform many varied functions in the cell. Some examples are: 
antibodies binding an antigen, cell-to-cell signaling molecules binding to 
surface receptors, DNA polymerase synthesizing a new strand of DNA, 
lactase catalyzing the breakdown of lactose. Broad categories of function of 
proteins are: make stuff, break stuff down, transport stuff, signal or 
propagate the signal, create or anchor structures. These categories can be 
further broken down into many subcategories. 

Each team will now get a model of the binding pocket that the protein complex interacts 
with. 

11. Can all your protein complex models fit into the pocket? 
No, one of the mutant complexes has an outer shape that excludes the 
ability to fit into the pocket. 

12. 7.013 contains a number of different units, most corresponding to different 
disciplines in biology. Do you expect that learning about the principles behind 
molecular interactions today will help you with the material in the other units of 
the course? Why or why not? 
Understanding the principles behind molecular interactions will help you in all

units of the course focusing on the molecular and cellular levels because:

-Molecules interact because they can.

-The only information in a cell is shape and chemical identities.

-These are encoded in or determined by other molecules which themselves

have shapes, and the “decoding” itself proceeds by the same mechanism of

shape fitting. 

-Any other level at which we describe a biological system is an 
abstraction that ultimately must have an explanation on this basic level 
of shape fitting and interaction. 
-Ways to describe and study biological systems are ways to study 
properties of these interactions.
