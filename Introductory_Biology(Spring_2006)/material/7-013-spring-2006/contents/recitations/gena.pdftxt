Solutions to Genetics Section Problems 
Mice I 
a) Cross 1: red eyes X white eyes gives all red eyes – a likely model is that eye color is 
controlled by one gene that has 2 alleles resulting in two phenotypes, red eyes and white eyes. 
The red eyed phenotype is likely to be dominant. Therefore, choose appropriate symbols (one 
letter per gene, capital letter for allele with dominant phenotype): 
R - red allele. Dominant phenotype of red eyes. 
r - white allele. Recessive phenotype of white eyes. 
Cross 1 is then: RR X rr ----> all Rr (all red eyes). 
Cross 2 is then: Rr X Rr ----> 3:1 red:white. 
The predictions agree with the data. 

b) Cross 1: long ears X short ears gives some long and some short ears – a likely model is that 
ear length is controlled by one gene with 2 alleles resulting in two phenotypes, long ears and 
short ears. From this data, we cannot determine which allele has the dominant phenotype. 
Cross 2: long ears X long ears gives some long and some short ears – a likely model is that 
long ears is the dominant phenotype. Therefore, the appropriate symbols are: 
L - long ears . 
l - short ears . 
Cross 1 is then: Ll X ll ----> 1:1 long ears : short ears 
Cross 2 is then Ll X Ll ----> 3:1 long ears : short ears 
The predictions agree with the data. 

Flowers: 
Cross 1: blue flowers X white flowers gives all pale blue flowers – a plausible model is that
color is controlled by one gene with 2 alleles, resulting in blue and white flowers, and that
neither phenotype is dominant.  This is an example of Partial or Semi or Incomplete 
dominance. 
BB - blue phenotype. 
B'B' - white phenotype. 
BB' - pale blue phenotype. 
therefore: 

Cross 1 is then: BB X B'B' ----> all BB', pale blue flowers.

Cross 2 is then: BB' X BB' ----> 1:2:1  BB, blue flowers : BB', pale blue flowers : B'B',white

flowers.  The predictions agree with the data. 


Blood Type 
Blood type is determined by one gene that has three alleles: 
IA - allele associated with the A phenotype, co-dominant with the B phenotype
IB  - allele associated with the B phenotype, co-dominant with the A phenotype
IO  - allele associated with the O phenotype, recessive to both the A and B phenotype 
a) Cross 1 is then: IAIA X IB IB  ----> all type IAIB 
Cross 2 is then: IAIB  X IAIB  ----> 1:2:1  types A:AB:B (note skewed ratio with small number of

progeny)


b) Cross 1 is then: IAIO  X  IB IO----> 1:1:1:1 types A:B:AB:O (note skewed ratio with small 

number  of  progeny)

The predictions agree with the data.


Mice II: 
a) Tail-lessness and lethality are controlled by one gene with two alleles:
T allele - dominant tail-less phenotype; recessive lethal phenotype
t allele - recessive normal-tail phenotype; dominant viable phenotype 
therefore: 
TT - tail-less and dead 
Tt - tail-less and alive 
tt - normal-tail and alive 
Cross 1 is then: Tt X tt ---->  1:1, Tt (tail-less) : tt (normal) 
Cross 2 is then: Tt X Tt ----> 1:2:1 normal:tail-less:dead 
The predictions agree with the data. 

b) eye color is determined by one gene with two alleles: 
B - dominant blue-eye phenotype 
b  - recessive brown eye phenotype 
tooth length is determined by one gene with two alleles: 
T - dominant short-tooth phenotype 
t - recessive  long tooth phenotype 
Cross 1 is then: BBss X bbSS ----> all BbSs

Cross 2 is then: BbSs X BbSs ----> 9:3:3:1  (B_S_): (B_ss): (bbS_): (bbss)

The predictions agree with the data.


Plants 
Height is determined by one gene with two alleles where the tall phenotype is dominant over 
the  short phenotype. 
Color is determined by one gene with two alleles where the green phenotype is dominant 
over  the yellow phenotype. 
Cross 1 is then: TtGG X ttgg ----> 1:1  tall and green (TtGg) : short and yellow ( ttGg)
Cross 2 is then: TTGg X ttgg ----> 1:1 (tall and green (TtGg) : tall and yellow (Ttgg)
