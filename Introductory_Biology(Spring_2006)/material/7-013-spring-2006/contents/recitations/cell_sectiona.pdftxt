1) and 2) 

a)  golgi apparatus - stores, modifies, and packages proteins. 

b)  rough endoplasmic reticulum - synthesis and sequestration of proteins that 
function outside the cytosol. 

c) mitochondrion - energy transformation - cell "power plant" - ATP synthesis. 

d) smooth ER - lipid synthesis, chemical modification of proteins. 

e) lysosome - a membrane-bound vesicle with hydrolyzing and digesting enzymes. 

f) nucleus - contains cellular DNA - stores most of the cell's information. 

g) ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum - protein synthesis. 

h) nucleolus - a spherical body found within the nucleus, where ribosomal RNA is 
synthesized. 

i) plasma membrane - separates the cell from the environment, regulates traffic of 
materials in and out of cell. 

3 a) 	

i) plasma membrane 

ii) endoplasmic reticulum 

iii) Golgi apparatus 

iv) ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum 

v) cytoplasm 

vi) free ribosomes 

vii) smooth ER 

viii) mitochondrion


ix) Nucleus


3 b) How do prokaryotic cells differ from eukaryotic cells?  Prokaryotic cells do not 
have a nucleus nor organelles like mitochondria, ER, and Golgi apparatus. 

4) Currently, scientist estimate that life first appeared on approximately 4 billion years 
ago. 

5) A key point in the theory of evolution is: slight variations among individuals 
significantly affect the chance that a given individual will survive in its environment and 
reproduce.  These variations among individuals are due to mutations. 

6) Surface tension occurs in water because it has hydrogen bonds. 

7) The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. 

8) The building blocks of proteins are amino acids. 

9) All cells have a membrane composed of phospholipids. 

10) In the process of glycolysis, cells make energy in the form of ATP. 

11) Oxidation and reduction occur together. 

l2) What is a gene?  A segment of DNA that directs the production of a protein or 
RNA molecule. 

13) The "Central Dogma" states that information flow in the cell is from DNA to RNA to 
protein. 

14) Are the genes in your eye cells the same as the genes in your gut cells? 
The genes in the two are the same. 

15) Are the proteins in your eye cells the same as the proteins in your gut cells? The 
proteins in the two are different.
