Problem


I. 
a) & b) One way to solve this problem is to work out the genotypes of the individuals in the 

pedigree.


A  + 
B  + 
(+/+ most likely 
assumption) 

O – 
O – 
(the only 
possibility) 

O  +
 most likely configuration
A – 
–  also possible, but less likely
O 
because the 2 affected children 
A  + 
– 
A 
must receive a 
chromosome, which requires 
recomination in this individual.

c) Individual 3 received an O  - chromosome from dad and the B  + chromosome from mom. 

(the only possibilities)

= 

d) To have type B blood, the child must have gotten an O - chromosome from mom and a 
B  ? chromosome from dad. 

The recombination frequency (RF) gives the probability of crossover (genetic exchange) between
two genes. In the case of individual (3), he can produce 4 types of gametes: 

•  B  –  recombinant 
•  O  +  recombinant 

•  B  +  parental 
•  O  –  parental 

In order to be diseased and  B, recombination must have occurred and since the recombinantion 
frequency  is 11% (see first paragraph), the chance of being B and diseased is 11%. 

II. 

a) What are the genotypes of Phil and Ryan with respect to these two genes. Use the letter E for
ear wiggling and the letter R for tongue rolling. 
Phil 
E  + 
+  R 

Ryan 
+  + 
+  + 

b) How do you account for the fact that Ryan is unable to roll his tongue or wiggle his ears? 

During meiosis in Phil, there was recombination between the chromosome carrying the ability to wiggle
gene and the one carrying the ability to roll gene. 

E  + 
+  R 

--> 

E  R  and  +  + 

Ryan received the wildtype chromosome from his mother and the recombined completely wildtype
chromosome from his father.
