 c) Influx of what ion plays a central role in converting an electrical signal to a chemical 
signal? 

d) Outline the steps involved in neuotransmitter release after the action potential 
invades the terminal of the pre-synaptic cell. 

e) What would happen if the presynaptic neuron in d) were exposed to Ca2+ channel 
blockers? 

Acetylcholine (abbreviated ACh) is one of the most common neurotransmitters in both 
invertebrates and vertebrates. Its function is varied. At the neuromuscular junction, 
acetylcholine is released from the terminal of a presynaptic motor axon. The effect on 
the postsynaptic skeletal muscle cell is excitatory. In the heart, however, acetylcholine 
can be inhibitory, so that it slows the heart rate. 

f) How can the same neurotransmitter trigger the opposite responses in different cell 
types? 

To study the function of ACh, one can isolate an entire neuromuscular junction. You can 
study synaptic transmission by wrapping a wire around the presynaptic neuron, stimulating 
it with an electrical current, and then measuring the effects of this stimulation in the 
postsynaptic muscle cell. You can also apply ACh directly onto the muscle cell to get the 
same effect. 

g) In your studies you find that ACh receptors are localized to a specific point in the 
muscle cell. (Applying ACh elsewhere on the muscle has no effect.) Where on the muscle 
cell would ACh receptors need to be to function properly? 

Part B 

You are doing electrophysiological recordings on a neuron innervating muscle fiber as shown. The 
neuromuscular juction is an acetylcholinergic synapse between the neuron and the muscle fiber. 
You are injecting current through the “Stimulus” electrode and taking recordings from the other 
electrodes, labeled 1 and 2  placed in the positions shown.

You create the following arrangement of cells in vitro. 

Neuron 1 

Neuron 2 

Neuron 3 

Neuron 4 

Neuron 5 

Inhibitory
Neuron  6 

The large neuron receives 4 synaptic inputs from cells 1-4 that are identical in every way except for their 
location. Each neuron releases the same amount of neurotransmitter when stimulated. 

•	 When neuron 1 is stimulated, the post-synaptic cell does not fire an action potential. 

•	 When neuron 3 is stimulated, the post-synaptic cell fires an action potential. 

a) When neuron 4 is stimulated, would you predict that an action potential is generated in the post-synaptic 
cell?  Explain why or why not. 

b) What would determine whether neuron 2 would result in an action potential in the post-synaptic cell? 

c) When an inhibitory neuron is stimulated and releases neurotransmitter, neurotransmitter binds to and 
opens ion channels on the post-synaptic cell. What ion might move through these channels? What is the 
effect on the post-synaptic cell? 

d) Neuron 5 releases only one kind of neurotransmitter, and synapses onto two distinct cell types. Circle 
the statements that are true.

The neurotransmitter released by neuron 5 could be excitatory at both synapses. 

The neurotransmitter released by neuron 5 could be inhibitory at both synapses. 

The neurotransmitter released by neuron 5 could be inhibitory at one synapse and excitatory at the 
other. 

The neurotransmitter receptors on the post-synaptic cells could be the same as each other. 

The neurotransmitter receptors on the post-synaptic cells could be different from each other. 

The neurotransmitter released by neuron 5 at one synapse could diffuse and affect the other synapse.
