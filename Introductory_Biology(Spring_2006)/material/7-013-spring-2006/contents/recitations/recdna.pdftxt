7.013 Section Problem: Recombinant DNA/Cloning
You have been given a purified DNA preparation of p7013, a 3000 bp circular plasmid, which contains a
bacterial origin of replication (ori) and the gene for ampicillin resistance (ampr).  In addition, you also have a
preparation of a 200 bp linear DNA fragment, isolated from an EcoRI restriction digest of some other DNA,
which contains the entire gene for tetracycline resistance (tetr). These two DNA molecules with their
known restriction enzyme sites are shown below.

a) You digest p7013 with EcoRI, and separate the p7013 and the tet gene DNA samples by size on an agarose
gel. Draw the pattern you would predict on the diagram below.

You want to produce a plasmid containing genes that confer both ampicillin and tetracycline
resistance which can be called p7013-AT.  To accomplish this task, you have available the above four
restriction enzymes, StuI, SalI, PvuII, and EcoRI.  The recognition sequences where the enzymes restrict
the DNA are shown above.
In order to insert the tet gene fragment into the p7013 plasmid, you decide to cut p7013 with
EcoRI, to produce a vector with the same complementary overhanging ends as the tet gene fragment.  You
then mix the two DNAs together in a tube and ligate them with the enzyme DNA ligase.  You take your
ligation mix and add it to E. coli cells* which are then spread on ampicillin-containing plates (solid medium in
petri dishes) and grown overnight to isolate bacterial colonies.

*Under special conditions, plasmid DNA can enter E. coli cells.  The plasmid DNA functions as normal DNA, 
i.e., genes on the plasmid can be transcribed and translated.  E. coli cells that have incorporated a plasmid 
are said to be “transformed”. 

b) Why is it necessary to grow the cells on plates containing ampicillin? 

Each bacterial cell that received a plasmid should grow up into a bacterial colony on a petri dish containing 
ampicillin medium.  When the plasmid DNA from three of these colonies: plasmids 1, 2 and 3, are analyzed by 
restriction enzyme analysis with EcoRI and SalI, a distinct pattern is observed for each of the three 
plasmids. The patterns seen after electrophoretic separation of the DNA fragments on a size separation gel 
are shown below along with DNA fragment size markers:

c) Make a diagram for each of the plasmid molecules, 1, 2 and 3 based on the restriction patterns shown in 
the gel above. 

d) If the transformation mix (E. coli cells + plasmid DNA) had been spread on plates containing both 
ampicillin and tetracycline, which of the above plasmids  would be able to grow? 

e) You would like to generate a single product, the p7013-AT with the tet gene in one unique orientation. Use 
any two of the available restriction enzymes to design such a procedure.
