1) 

2) Non-covalent Interactions 
a)
Interaction(s) of Group with Substrate 
Group 
(1) 
ionic (hydrogen  also possible) 
(2)  VDW (neither C nor S is electronegative 
enough to cause a H-bond to form) 
(3) 
VDW (all non-polar bonds) 
(4) 

H-bond (VDW also possible) 

Classification of Group

3) Substrate Analogues 

 Analog 1(does not bind)COOCOO(-) charge repels (-) charge of side group (1).Analog 2(binds)H3NCOH3CCan still H-bondwith side group (4).Analog 3(does not bind)NH3NCOOHPolar group interacts unfavorably with hydrophobic environment.** Note: a more complete way to look at these cases is:!! Binding of substrate (S) and protein (P) to form complex (S-P) is an equilibrium:        S(dissolved in water)+      P(dissolved in water)S-P complex(dissolved in water)• Compared to the normal substrate, the extra COO- group in analog 1 destabilizes (raises the free energy of) the S-P complex because of the charge repulsion, shifting the equilibrium to favor free S and P.• Compared to the normal substrate, the addition of the polar N-H group (whichcan H-bond with water) in analog 3 stabilizes (lowers the free energy of) free S in solution, shifting the equilibrium to favor free S and P.
