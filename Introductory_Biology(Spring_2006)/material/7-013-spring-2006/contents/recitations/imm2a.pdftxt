1) destroy infected body cells 

Killer T cells 

2) specifically bind soluble antigen 

B cells 

3) present peptides on class II MHC 

B cells and Macrophages 

4) present peptides on class I MHC 

All nucleated body cells 

5) stimulate B cells 

Helper T cells 

6) undergo somatic recombination 

B cells, Helper T cells, and 
Killer T cells 

D. 

i) Once a body cell is infected, peptides specific to VZV are presented on class I 
MHC molecules on the surface of the infected cell.  Some killer T cells will 
recognize the MHC I/ VZV peptide complex as non-self, become activated and 
destroy the VZV-infected cells. 

ii) Once infected with VZV, the individual mounts a full immune response and 
eventually clears the virus.  Part of the immune response is the generation of 
memory B and T cells.  Upon re-exposure to VZV, the immune system is primed 
with cells proven effective against VZV.  The secondary immune response is 
faster and more effective and eliminates the virus before symptoms of VZV 
occur. 

iii) An argument for vaccination is to reduce pain and discomfort in young children, 
and ensure that no one enters adulthood susceptible to the disease. 

iv) An argument against vaccination is driven by the concern that the vaccine may 
not provide lifetime immunity against VZV.  It is not clear that whether the 
lifetime immunity of individuals is due to contracting the disease, or whether 
subsequent exposure to the VZV virus (from siblings, classmates, etc.) acts as 
an immune system booster.  If all children receive the vaccine, then after 
several years there will be no secondary exposures and thus no boost to the 
immune system.  The fear is then that these children reach adulthood they may 
be exposed to VZV (not every country will vaccinate all their children) and no 
longer have immunity.  The consequences of contracting VZV as an adult are 
unpleasant at best and life threatening in some cases.
