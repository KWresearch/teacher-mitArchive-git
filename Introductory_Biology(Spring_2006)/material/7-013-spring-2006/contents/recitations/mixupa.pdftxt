b) If DNA technology were not available (if it were 1950, or you were in an under-equipped lab) what test 
would you perform to sort out the identity of the twins parents?  Would this test give you a definitive 
answer? Why/why not? 

I would perform a blood type test. The twins might be of blood types that could only be formed by certain 
combinations of parents but not others. For example, if one of the babies were blood type AB, it could not 
have a parent of blood type O. However, this test might not give a definitive answer because there might 
be multiple combinations of potential parents that are compatible with the twinsâ€™ blood types. 

c) What DNA tests could be performed now to determine the identity of the parents?  Are these assays 
more or less likely to give definitive results than the test you proposed above?  Why/why not? 

You could perform tests using RFLPs (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) or SNPs (single 
nucleotide polymorphisms). These tests are more likely to be definitive than the blood test because you 
can test multiple RFLPs and/or SNPs per person and therefore have enough parameters to determine which 
combination of potential parents is correct.
