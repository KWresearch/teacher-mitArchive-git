Without the voltage-gated Na channels, 
the membrane depolarizes but cannot fire an action
potential. The pump repolarizes the membrane 
(with perhaps some help from the K channels).

Action potential fires as usual, but cell can only 
re-polarize via the pump, which takes a lot longer than 
to repolarize via the K channels.

Na channel remains inactive, 
because membrane has not yet repolarized.
