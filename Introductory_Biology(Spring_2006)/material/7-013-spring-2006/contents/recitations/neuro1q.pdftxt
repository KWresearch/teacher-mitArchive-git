7.012 Section problem: �
The Ionic Basis of Action Potentials�
You perform the following experiment on a normal neuron. You measure the following 
parameters of a small region of the axonal membrane as a function of time: 
•� membrane potential 
•� net direction and approximate magnitude of K+ ion flow through axonal �
membrane �
•� net direction and approximate magnitude of Na+ ion flow through axonal �
membrane (not including injected Na+ ions) �
•� state of the voltage-gated Na+ channels (open – O, closed – C, or inactivated – I) 
•� state of the voltage-gated K+ channels (open – O or closed – C) 

During the course of the experiment, you inject a small amount of Na+ ions into the 
axonal cytoplasm in the region where we are measuring the above parameters. The first 
injection results in a sub-threshold depolarization (no action potential fires) and the 
second results in an action potential. These injections of Na+ ions are shown on the top 
line of the next page. 

a) For a normal neuron, fill in the remaining parameters on the following diagram as a 
function of time for the region of membrane we are studying.

b) In a separate experiment, you pre-treat the neuron with a drug that blocks the voltage-
gated Na+ channels and then perform the same injection experiments. On the graphs 
below, predict the resulting behavior of the neuron.

c) In a third experiment, you pre-treat the neuron with a drug that prevents the K+ 
channels from opening wider when the neuron depolarizes (the constitutive K+ leak 
channel is still open) and then perform the same injection experiments. On the graphs 
below, predict the resulting behavior of the neuron.
