7 .013   SECT ION   PROBLEM  
PROTEIN SECRETION AND LOCALIZATION 

The following 4 proteins are found in a yeast cell. 
is a cytoplasmic protein 
Protein 1 
Protein 2 
is a secreted protein 
is a secreted protein 
Protein 3 
Protein 4 
is a plasma membrane protein 
Describe how each of the following mutations (a-f) affect the localization of these above 
proteins. 

outside the cell 
in the cytoplasm 
in transport vesicles 
in secretory vesicles 

in the golgi 
in the ER 
in the plasma membrane 
in the nucleus 

Fill in the blanks below with the term(s) from the previous list to indicate the resulting locations of the 
proteins. 

a)	 Mutation A is a deletion of the signal sequence protein 2. Where would the majority of the following 
proteins be found in a strain with this mutation? 

Protein 1? 
Protein 2? 
Protein 3? 
Protein 4? 
b)  Mutation B inactivates the SRP (signal recognition particle), preventing it from binding to signal 
sequences. Where would the majority of the proteins be in a strain with this mutation? 

Protein 1? 
Protein 2? 
Protein 3? 
Protein 4? 
c)  Mutation C results in a deletion of the transmembrane domain of protein 4. Where would the majority 
of the following proteins be found in a strain with this mutation? 

Protein 1?

Protein 2?

Protein 3?

Protein 4? 

d) Mutation D blocks the fusion of the transport protein vesicles with the Golgi membrane. Where would 
the majority of the following proteins be found in a strain with this mutation? 

Protein 1?

Protein 2?

Protein 3?

Protein 4? 

e) Mutation E eliminates the SRP docking protein on the ER membrane. Where would the majority of the 
following proteins be found in a strain with this mutation? 

Protein 1? 
Protein 2? 
Protein 3? 
Protein 4? 
f) Mutation F inserts a signal sequence in frame at the beginning of Protein 1. Where would the majority of 
the following proteins be found in a strain with this mutation? 
Protein 1? 
Protein 2? 
Protein 3? 
Protein 4?
