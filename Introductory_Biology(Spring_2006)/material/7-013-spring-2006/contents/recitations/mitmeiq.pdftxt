7.013 LEGO MITOSIS/MEIOSIS SECTION 

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MITOSIS and MEIOSIS 
Difference by category 
Mitosis 
Meiosis 

1. This process can occur in what kind of cells? 

2. How many cells does this process produce at 
the end? 

3. How do the chromosomes line up at the 
middle of the cell before the first division? 

4. Are the new cells identical to the original or 
are they genetically different? 

5. Compare the total amount of DNA in each 
new cell with the amount of DNA in the 
original cell. 

6. How many times does the sequence of cell 
division occur in this process? 

TRUE OR FALSE? 
MITOSIS 

MEIOSIS 

7. DNA duplication happens prior to this cell process. 

8. Microtubules move the chromosomes. 

9. Chromatids are joined together at the centromere. 

10. Recombination occurs on every chromosome during 
this process.
