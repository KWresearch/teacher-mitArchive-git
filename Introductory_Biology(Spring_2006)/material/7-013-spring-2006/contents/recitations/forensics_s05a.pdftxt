a) 
5' CTGAATTACGT 3' 
b) No, TA6â€™s DNA sequence for gene K is different than that found on the note. 

c) See above 

d) TA1 and TA5.  Their DNA samples at the gene L locus do not match the sample

found on the bag.


e) The strategy is as follows: 

You design the following two primers to PCR amplify position Z. 

primer 2 
3'GCTGC5' 

primer 1 
5'GTGCA3' 

f)

i) 

1: TA2 
2: TA5 
3: TA1 
4: TA3 or TA6 
5: TA4 
6: TA3 or TA6 
ii) TA3 must have committed this crime. Only TA6 and TA3 match the sample
taken from the note.  TA6 is no longer a suspect due to part a.
