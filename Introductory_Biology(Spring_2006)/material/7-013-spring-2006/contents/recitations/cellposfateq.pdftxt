7.013 Cell Type and Position Section 
The chicken wing (forelimb) develops primarily from a population of mesodermal cells that 
migrate from near the midline of the embryo laterally to the position of the future 
forelimb. After migration, they form the "limb bud" which later differentiates into the 
forelimb.

The limb is organized by a region called the ZPA, which is required for formation of 
another region called the AER. In turn, the AER organizes the mesoderm to form a limb.

AER    Mesoderm 

Three pivotal proteins for fore limb development are Fgf8. secreted by a region called 
the AER, sonic hedgehog (Shh), secreted by a region called the ZPA and the transcription 
factor, Tbx5, expressed in the forelimb mesoderm.

Forelimbs and hindlimbs are clearly different from one another in the shape of the bones 
and digits (fingers or toes). You perform a series of transplants between early fore and 
hindlimb buds to determine what tissues are pivotal in deciding whether a forelimb (FL) 
versus hindlimb (HL) forms.
