Solutions: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors 

a) Yes.  One mutant copy of the activated ras oncogene can 
transform a cell into a tumor cell, regardless of the other ras 
genes. 

b) No. The cell still has two functional copies of the Rb gene. 
Any good copy of the Rb gene will produce the Rb protein that 
will halt cell cycle progression when necessary. 

c) Yes.  One copy of the EGFR gene that encodes a mutant, 
constitutively active receptor can transform a cell into a 
tumor cell, regardless of the other EGFR genes. 

d) Yes. This could produce a self-stimulation cell. The 
introduced copy of the epo gene could allow the cell to 
produce and secrete the Epo protein.  The Epo protein could 
then bind to the Epo receptor on the erythroid stem cell and 
stimulate cell division. 

e) Yes. The cell would now have two functional copies of the 
Rb gene and two mutations are required to produce a tumor 
cell phenotype.
