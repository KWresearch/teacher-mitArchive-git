A. 
You would like to generate antibodies against a specific antigen, antigen A, derived from a mammalian virus. 
You inject a rabbit with antigen A to hopefully elicit antibodies, and you assay antigen A specific antibody 
levels in rabbit blood every seven days.  On day 28 you inject the same rabbit with more antigen A and 
measure antibody response for the next four weeks. 

The results of your measurements are shown below.  As a necessary control, you tested the blood of this 
rabbit prior to any injections (0 time point).

a) Why is the antibody response low on day 28 and high after day 35? 

b) Antibodies to antigen A were detected on day 0 (prior to injection of antigen A) in a 
second rabbit in this study. How could this be explained? 

c) Suppose on day 28 the rabbit was injected with both antigen A and a different 
antigen, antigen B. 

i) Would you expect the levels of antibody against antigen B on day 35 to be higher, 
lower, or the same as the levels of antibodies against antigen A? 

ii) Draw a graph indicating the levels of antibodies to antigens A and B vs. time.

A cell clone represents identical cells that have descended from a single progenitor cell. 
You are a new UROP in an immunology lab and have been given the following task.  You are 
to determine the specificity of two helper T cell clones (THA, and THB) that were found 
in the freezer.  All THA cells express the same T cell receptor (TCR).  All THB cells 
express the same TCR (a TCR distinct from the TCR expressed by THA). 

You grow two different cell types, a B cell clone or macrophages.  To each cell type you 
add a TH cell clone with either virus 1 or virus 2 and determine if the  cells are 
stimulated to divide.  The data is given below.  Stimulation is denoted +, no stimulation is 
denoted -.

a) Which virus do THA cells recognize? 

b) Which virus do THB cells recognize? 

c) Why are THA cells stimulated to grow by B cells plus virus 1, but not by B cells plus 
virus 2? 

d) Why are THB cells stimulated to grow by macrophages plus virus 2, but not by B cells 
plus virus 2?
