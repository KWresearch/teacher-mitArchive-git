In sea urchin, the potential difference across the egg cell membrane changes from 
negative to positive following fusion of sperm and egg. This change is depicted below.

i)  Slow block to polyspermy 

ii)  Fast block to polyspermy 

iii)  Action potential 

iv)  Cortical rotation 

v) 

PTI signaling 

b) Which of the following assures species specific recognition of sperm and egg during 
fertilization?  Circle all that apply. 
i)  Mammalian plasma membrane 

ii)  Mammalian ZP3 

iii)  Sea urchin bindin 

iv)  Sea urchin cortical granules 

v)  Sea urchin sperm flagella PTI signaling 

In the following theoretical embryo, it is possible to track the development of the head,
eyes, skin and gut lining from three initial types of cells:  X, Y and Z.

X cells

Y cells

Z cells

Day 5 embryo
(3D)

Day 12 embryo (cross section)

Head

Eye

Skin

Gut lining

Day 15 embryo

c) Based on the diagram, give a one short sentence explanation for the following
experimental results.

i) Removal of Z cells at Day 5 gives rise to a normal organism.

ii) Replacement of all X cells with Z cells at Day 5 gives rise to normal development.

iii) Removal of the involuting Z cells at Day 12 leads to the absence of head structure
development.

iv) Placement of an impermeable barrier between X cells and Z cells at Day 12 prevents
head formation.

v) Removing X cells at Day 12 prevents head formation BUT NOT eye development.

e) An embryo whose Y cells lack the Dodo gene develops normal skin but has
undifferentiated Z cells in place of gut lining at Day 15.  The gene product of Dodo is
more likely to be a... (Circle one.)
