7.013 Sp 05 Chemistry Review 

1) Covalent Bonds:  Shown on the 
right is a hypothetical substrate 
molecule binding to a hypothetical 
protein. The substrate binds to the 
enzyme via non-covalent (hydrogen, 
ionic, Van der Waals) bonds. Below is 
a close-up of the substrate and 
substrate binding region of the protein. 

The squiggle bonds (~) indicate the covalent bonds which connect the side-chains to the rest of the 
protein. These side-chains hold the substrate in place via non-covalent interactions. Draw in the 
remaining covalent bonds and appropriate charges. A covalent bond between a pair of atoms may 
be indicated by a solid line (–) (Don’t draw them as squiggly lines!).

2) Non-covalent interactions: (Ionic, Hydrogen, and Van der Waals' bonds).

a) Each of the 4 side chains of the protein which interact with the substrate are numbered on the

figure above. For each side chain, state which type(s) of interactions it could have with the

substrate in the configuration shown above. Also classify each side chain as hydrophobic,

hydrophilic-polar, or hydrophilic-charged.

3) Substrate Analogues 
One way to study the non-covalent interactions between substrate and protein is to synthesize 
molecules similar to the substrate and see if they bind to the protein. Shown below are 3 
"substrate analogs" along with the normal substrate. Explain, in terms of the interactions you 
described in part (a), why each of the analogs binds or fails to bind to the protein.
