Question 1 
You’ve heard that too much sunbathing can be harmful, so before you splurge on a trip to the 
Bahamas, you decide to test the effects of prolonged UV exposure on DNA.  You compare DNA 
encoding the Sun E protease from a WT E. colistrain with the corresponding DNA from a UV 
irradiated culture. 

The highlighted bases below lie in internal piece of the sun E gene encoding the crucial serine 
(Ser111) in the Sun E protease active site.

Question 2 

During a coffee break at Starbucks, you identify a colony of mice with a caffeine 
resistant phenotype; that is, they can consume sacks of caffeine-containing coffee beans 
without showing any of the jitteriness of normal mice.  When you cross a pure breeding 
caffeine resistant mouse with a pure breeding normal mouse, the resulting mice are all 
caffeine resistant. 

Caffeine Resistant mice 

X 

Normal mice

ALL Caffeine Resistant mice 

a) You cross two F1 mice from the above cross and obtain twenty offspring.  How many of 
the offspring would you expect to have normal sensitivity to caffeine?  4 pts 
5


You observe that ALL of the caffeine resistant mice from Starbucks have white fur. 

And ALL the pure breeding colony of mice with normal caffeine sensitivity have black fur. 

When you look again at the F1 generation, you observe that they all have black fur. 


Caffeine Resistant White-furred mice 

X  Normal Black-furred mice

ALL Caffeine Resistant Black-furred mice 
F1 
b). For each pair below, circle the recessive phenotype 4 pts 

Caffeine Resistant / Normal 

White  / Black 

c) If you cross one of these F1 generation mice with the parental caffeine resistant 
white mice and produce 32 offspring, what would be their expected distribution? 6 pts 

Caffeine resistant, white:  _____16_________ 

Caffeine resistant, black:  ______16________ 

Normal caffeine sensitivity, white:  _______0_______ 

Normal caffeine sensitivity, black:  ________0______ 

4 

You perform a test cross of the F1 caffeine resistant black mice with mice exhibiting 
both of the phenotypes that you have identified as recessive.  You get progeny with the 
following characteristics. 

Phenotype 
Caffeine Resistant, white 
Caffeine Resistant, black 
normal, black 
normal, white 

# of progeny 
449 
51 
451 
49 

e) What is the recombination frequency between the “caffeine resistance” and the “fur 
color ” genes? Show your work.  5 pts 
51+49/ 51+49 +449+451 = 50/500--> 10% 

_______10%______ 

Previous studies revealed that the gene conferring black or white fur color maps 36 map 

units away from the ear gene which determines ear size.


f) Based on all the information above, draw two possible arrangements for the “caffeine”,

“fur color”, and “ear” genes on the chromosomes below naming the genes in the boxes and 

indicating between them the distances in map units. Note, if the genes are unlinked, write 

UNLINKED.

Question 3 

A mysterious bacterium has stricken the world and threatens to wipe out its population. 
Luckily, you think you have found an enzyme, Panase, that specifically inactivates an 
essential protein, Pan-X, found only in the lethal bacteria.  Before telling others of this 
news, you wish to learn more. 

a) Drawn below are the first 4 amino acids of the Panase’s primary sequence. 

i) Circle each side chain and label it “R.” 

ii) Circle each peptide bond and label it “P.”  (When circling peptide bonds, only identify 
the line representing the bond itself and not the surrounding atoms.) 5 pts 4-sidechains,
