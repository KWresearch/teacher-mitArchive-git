Question 2, continued 

d) Puromycin is an antibiotic that has an effect on both prokaryotes 
and eukaryotes.  Puromycin, which is structurally similar to the 
aminoacyl terminus of an aminoacyl-tRNA (see diagram), inhibits 
protein synthesis by releasing nascent polypeptide chains before 
their synthesis is completed. 

R represents the side group of the amino acid
R' is  the remainder of the tRNA 

Explain how puromycin can affect this result on growing polypeptide 
chains and why the peptide chain is released. 

Question 3 
a) Many patients are coming into the emergency room with a disease 
caused by an unknown pathogen! A doctor studies this pathogen in 
order to create a vaccine against it. She discovers that the 
infectious agent is an intracellular bacterium and its cell surface is 
coated with human-like proteins. Considering the mechanism of the 
pathogen, the doctor decides to generate a live-attenuated vaccine 
instead of a heat-killed vaccine. 

i) What are the two advantages of using a live-attenuated vaccine 
vs. a heat killed vaccine in this case? 

ii) What is a disadvantage of using a live-attenuated vaccine?

against this protein are generated.  If, however, the same rabbit 
protein is injected into guinea pigs, the guinea pigs generate 
antibodies against the rabbit protein.  Briefly (in one or two 
sentences) explain this observation. 

c) The genomes contained in almost all of the somatic cells in an adult 
human are identical.  Name one (diploid) cell type that is an 
exception to this and specify the process by which the genetic

allele. 

ii) What is the probability that individual B is a carrier of disease 
X?

b) The most common mutant allele of the disease X gene is a deletion 
of three nucleotides which eliminates a phenylalanine at amino acid 
residue 508.  Although the mutant X protein is made, it is not 
localized to the plasma membrane. 
i) Assuming the altered X protein is stable, where might it be 
found? 

ii) Describe another mutation in this gene that could prevent the
disease X protein from localizing to the plasma membrane.

Spring 2005 Final Exam Practice 

11 

Question 4, continued 

c) Researchers are currently working on gene therapy for disease X 
patients.  The most promising therapy has involved incorporating the 
disease X gene into an adenovirus.  Because adenovirus is a double-
stranded DNA virus that targets lung epithelial cells, it can be used 
to deliver the disease X gene to the lung cells of the affected 
individual. 

i) The adenovirus used in these studies is able to produce gp19, a 
protein that inhibits the display of MHC I molecules on the surface 
of cells.  Why is this a  desirable property of the virus used to 
deliver the disease X gene? 

ii) Using the plasmids and restriction enzymes provided, design a 
procedure to 
create a, double-stranded DNA to incorporate 
into the adenovirus particle.  The final product should be linear, 
contain the majority of the virus genome and have the disease X 
gene under control of the E1 promoter (PE1).  NheIand SpeIcreate 
the same sticky ends.  All the other restriction enzymes create 
unique cuts.

Question 5 

You have discovered a new enzyme, enzyme X, which breaks down 
proteins by cleaving peptide bonds after tyrosine or phenylalanine. 
a) Enzyme X is the product of gene X that encodes a protein with the 
molecular weight of 50 kilodaltons (50 kD).  You purify active 
enzyme X and find it has a molecular weight of 250 kilodaltons (250 
kD). 

i) Why is active enzyme X larger than the product encoded by gene 
X ?  

Spring 2005 Final Exam Practice

ii) Compare and contrast the primary, tertiary, and quaternary 
structure of the 50 kD protein and the 250 kD protein.  (6 points) 

b) You test enzyme X activity using a large protein as the substrate. 
This protein is not cleaved by enzyme X.  You then treat the large 
protein with DTT (a compound that disrupts disulfide bonds) and 
test the enzyme X activity again.  This time the large protein is 
cleaved by enzyme X. 

Why was enzyme X able to cleave the substrate protein only after 
the large protein was treated with DTT?

the amino acid side chains and and give the most likely reason why

Question 6 
The bos/seven receptor is required for differentiation of a 
particular cell, called R7.  It is a receptor tyrosine kinase with the 
structure below. As a monomer, the protein is inactive.  Binding of 
ligand causes the receptor to dimerize, causing phosphorylation of 
the intracellular domain, activating the protein.  During processing 
of the protein, the extracellular domain is cleaved and a disulfide 
bridge forms between two cysteines, tethering the ligand-binding 
domain to the rest of the protein.

transmembrane domain.  What property do those amino acids have in 
common, and why do they cause the transmembrane domain to stay in 
the membrane? 

c) Draw a schematic of the receptor tyrosine kinase (discussed 
above) prior to any cleavage or modification using the template 
below.  Include the domains of this protein that are required for 
targeting to and insertion in the plasma membrane.  Also label the 
intracellular and extracellular domains.

d) Activation of the above receptor causes Ras to exchange GDP for 
GTP, thereby activating it.  This activated Ras can activate a signal 
transduction cascade, which ultimately results in the transcription of 
genes required for R7 differentiation.  In different cells in the same 
animal, Ras can be activated by an activated growth factor receptor. 
This leads to transcription of genes required for cell division.

Question 7 
You are studying a common genetic condition.  The mutant allele 
differs from the wild-type allele by a single base-pair (bp) 
substitution.  This substitution eliminates a NheI restriction site 
that is present in the wild-type allele.  (The mutant allele is not cut 
by NheI.)  A pedigree of a family exhibiting this condition is shown

techniques, you amplify a 1000 bp portion of their DNA that 
includes the site affected by the mutation.  You digest the PCR 
products with NheIand analyze the resulting DNA fragments on a 
gel:

You sequence the region around the NheI site in the wild-type PCR 
product.  You then sequence the corresponding region in the mutant 
PCR product and discover that not only did the mutation eliminate 
the NheI site in the mutant allele but it has created a new PvuII 
restriction site.  The recognition sites for the two enzymes are 
indicated below.

 Question 8 

While walking through the sub-basement of the Infinite Corridor 
late one night you come upon an enclave of gnomes.  You are struck 
by the color of their beards, which are all blue.  (Gnomes are diploid 
organisms, both male and female gnomes have beards, and you can 
assume that the gnomes are true-breeding for this trait.)  The 
following week you are busy pulling a hack at Harvard when you spy 
another enclave of gnomes.  All of these gnomes have yellow beards. 
(Again assume that the gnomes are true-breeding for this trait.) 
Curious, you collect a few yellow-bearded gnomes from Harvard and 
bring them back to MIT.  Later you discover that several of the 
yellow-bearded gnomes and blue-bearded gnomes have mated.  The 
offspring of these matings are all green-bearded.  Below are two 
possible explanations for these results. 

a) Possibility 1:  Beard color is controlled by a single locus.  Give the 
genotypes in the blanks below.

b )  
c) Consider each of the following three mutations independently. 
i) The mutation is before the start codon so does not change the 
protein sequence. 

ii) The start codon (at nucleotides 25 - 27) would be changed 
and protein synthesis would now start at the next start codon 
(position 31 - 33). The protein would be shorter by two amino 
acids. 

iii) This frameshift mutation will result in the protein being 
terminated prematurely because a new stop codon was created. 
As a result of this deletion, the new sequence of the peptide 
would be :   H3N+-methionine-alanine-COO-

d) Puromycin functions by entering the A site of the ribosome. Here, 
because puromycin is structurally similar to the aminoacyl-tRNA, it 
can participate in formation of a peptide bond with the nascent

ribosome because there is no t-RNA anticodon to link the mRNA to 
the peptide chain.

ii)  1) Digest pBR-Ad2-7 with NheI and HindIII. 
2) Digest pCMV-disease X with SpeI and HindIII. Isolate the 
CFTR cDNA fragment. 
3) Ligate the products of steps 1 and 2. 
4) Cut the resulting plasmid with BamHI to obtain a linear fragment 
with disease X gene at the PE1 promoter. 
Question 5 

You have discovered a new enzyme, enzyme E, that breaks down proteins by cleaving peptide bonds after tyrosine or phenylalanine. 

a) Enzyme E is the product of gene G which encodes a protein with the molecular weight of 50 kilodaltons (50 kD).  You purify active enzyme 
E and find it has a molecular weight of 250 kilodaltons (250 kD). 

i) Why might active purified enzyme E be larger than the product�
encoded by gene G?�

The active enzyme must have multiple subunits. Likely it is a 
pentamer of the 50 kD polypeptide encoded by gene X. 

ii) Define primary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. 
The primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids.�
The tertiary structure is the 3 dimensional shape.�
The quaternary structure is the association of distinct polypeptide�
chains with each other.�
iii) Is the primary structure of the 50 kD protein the same or different than the primary structure of the 250 kD protein?  Explain�
breifly.�
The primary structure is the same. The linear sequence of amino�
acids is the same.�
Spring 2005 Final Exam Practice 

30 

iv) Is the tertiary structure of the 50 kD protein the same or different than the tertiary structure of the 250 kD protein?  Explain 
briefly. 
The tertiary structure is the same. Each polypeptide folds to form 
the same 3 dimensional shape. 

Alternative answer: 
The tertiary structure may be different. Although each 
polypeptide can fold to form the same 3 dimensional shape in 
isolation, when more than one polypeptide interact, the 3 
dimensional shape can change. 

v) Is the quaternary structure of the 50 kD protein the same or different than the quaternary structure of the 250 kD protein? 
Explain breifly. 
The 50 kD protein, as a single polypeptide does not have 
quaternary structure, the quaternary structure of the 250 kD 
protein is the five subunit nature of this protein. 

b) You test enzyme E activity on a large protein substrate.  This substrate is not cleaved by enzyme E.  You then treat the substrate with 
DTT (a compound that disrupts disulfide bonds) and test the enzyme E activity again.  This time the substrate is cleaved by enzyme E. 
Why was enzyme E able to cleave the protein substrate only after the substrate was treated with DTT? 
Enzyme X binds and cuts at specific sites. These site are not�
present on the exterior of the substrate when the substrate is�
properly folded. When the disulfide bonds within the substrate�
protein are disrupted, the 3 dimensional shape is altered, and the�
protein unfolds. This allows enzyme X access to sites that were�
previously protected within the substrate protein.�

interaction with the phosphate group is preserved. The side 
chains of both amino acids are also of similar size. 
ii) Tyr is much larger than Asp. Although Tyr can form a 
hydrogen bond, GDP will no longer fit into the binding pocket. 
The Tyr side chain is also much more hydrophobic than the Asp 
side chain.

Question 6 

a)� i) This would eliminate the disulfide bridge tethering the ligand-
binding domain to the rest of the protein. The receptor would 
be inactive. 

ii) This would prevent the differentiation of the R7 cell type. 

b) Leucine, alanine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, glycine, 
tryptophan are all hydrophobic amino acids. The hydrophobic effect 
causes these amino acids to cluster away from water and stay in the 
interior of the plasma membrane.

e)� i)  Ras can activate several different proteins, each of which 
leads to a different signal transduction cascade. Different 
cells express different genes, and the specific protein that a 
given cell expresses will determine the outcome of Ras 
activation. 

You never see diferentiation of R7 cells. 
ii)  • 
A loss-of function mutation in the boss/sev receptor would 
prevent signaling through Ras and activation of the 
differentiation pathway. 

• 

You see uncontrolled cell proliferation.

A gain-of function mutation in the EGF receptor such that 
it signals to Ras in the absence of growth factor would 
allow uncontrolled cell division. 
Question 7 
a) An autosome, because individual 6, a male, has 2 alleles. 
b) The mutant phenotype is recessive, because individuals 5 and 6 
each have one copy of the mutant allele, m, and are both 
phenotypically normal. 
c) 1/4. Since individuals 3 and 4 already have an affected child, 
then they must both be heterozygotes. 
d)  5’...GCCAGCTG...3’ 
e) A mutation occurred which led to the production of a new mutant 
allele, m*. This mutant allele has a recessive phenotype and its PCR 
product is cut by neither NheI nor PvuII. Individual 9 has the 
genotype m/m*.
