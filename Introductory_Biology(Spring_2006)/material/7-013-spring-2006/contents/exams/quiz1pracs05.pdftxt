c) Suppose that you are studying the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme. 
It is possible to make variant enzymes that differ from the one above by a single amino 
acid substitution. (For example, Asp 78 could be replaced with tryptophan). You could use 
this technique to investigate the roles of each amino acid shown above. 

If you change Arg 31 to a lysine, would you predict that the substrate still binds, or that 
the substrate now fails to bind to the altered enzyme?  Explain.

Question 2 

Practice Quiz 1 

a) You have started a UROP in the behavioral genetics department at the University of 
Monterrey in Mexico.  For your first assignment, your advisor asks you to figure out the 
genetics of a particular species of honeybee that has just been discovered- a red killer 
bee!  To begin your studies, you cross this true breeding red killer bee with the local true 
breeding blue gentle bee.  The F1 progeny show the following phenotype: 

54 red "feisty" bees 

You have characterized the disposition as such: 

gentle: will ignore humans and simply gather pollen 

killer: will attack and sting without provocation 

feisty: will approach humans threateningly, but will not sting 

a) Write the genotypes of the P parental types and the F1 progeny .

(Be sure to indicate which particular phenotype corresponds to each parental genotype.)

Use "H" and "h" as your symbols for the alleles of the gene conveying color or hue and "D

and d" as your symbols for alleles of the gene for disposition.


P


F1 

b) You want to determine if the gene for hue is linked to the gene involved in disposition. 
You decide to set up a test cross for the F1. Indicate the genotypes of the strains you 
choose for the cross. 

c) Using your chosen strains indicate the ratio of genotypes and phenotypes of the 
progeny if the traits are NOT linked.

e) On your first day of the job, a man with purple ears comes to your attention when he 
enters the office of the human geneticist with whom you are interning.  You questioned 
the man and wrote down the following family history. 

The man's mother and one of his sisters also had purple ears, but his father, his brother, 
and two other sisters had normal ears. The man and his normal-eared wife had seven 
children, including four boys and three girls. Two girls and two boys had purple ears. 

Draw the family pedigree and indicate what form of inheritance that the purple-ear trait 
most likely follows. Assume 100% penetrance. 

f) Another male patient comes in with red-green color blindness which you know is X-
linked in humans. If the male is red-green color blind, and both his parents have normal 
color vision, which of the male's grandparents is most likely to be red-green colorblind? 

a. maternal grandmother 

b. maternal grandfather 

c. paternal grandmother 

d. paternal grandfather 

e. either grandfather is equally likely
