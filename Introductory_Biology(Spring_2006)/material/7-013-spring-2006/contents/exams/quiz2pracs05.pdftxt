B. 
Polio has been practically eliminated from the American population, however, in countries where people have 
little or no access to vaccinations, it is still prevalent.  As a biologist with a global vision, you seek to create 
a transgenic banana that produces the protein used in the vaccine against polio.  By consuming these 
bananas, individuals will develop immunity against the disease.  The gene for this protein has already been 
cloned into a plasmid with a kanamycin-resistance gene (pKR-polio).  You need to attach to the gene a 
banana-specific promoter and DNA sequences that will allow the gene to be incorporated into banana DNA. 
These sequences are contained in the pBAN plasmid, which carries a gene for ampicillin resistance.  Maps of 
these two plasmids are shown on the next page, including important restriction sites and distances (in base 
pairs) between the sites.

Question 1 continued 

You isolate plasmid DNA from three colonies that pass your antibiotic resistance test.  You digest the DNA

Question 2 

Consider the following signal transduction pathway involved in smelling pumpkin pie. 

1) A pie odorant molecule (), one of the many aromatic compounds present in pumpkin pie, binds 
to a specific G protein-coupled olfactory receptor in an olfactory cell in your nose. 

2) The receptor-odorant complex activates a G protein, which displaces GDP and then binds to a 
molecule of GTP. 

3) The  subunit of the G protein dissociates and activates adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the 
production of cAMP from ATP. 

4) cAMP binds to a sodium channel, opening it and allowing Na+ to enter the cell.  This creates a 
nerve stimulus, which travels to the brain.  Your brain integrates the  odorant signal with 
signals from other olfactory receptors in your nose.  The brain interprets the signal as the 
odor of pumpkin pie.  You think, “Mmm...pie.” 

a) How does binding of the  odorant molecule stimulate the receptor protein and how does this activate the G 
protein? 

b) Although it might be nice to have the sensation of smelling pie continuously, once the  odorants are gone, 
signaling stops.  How is the signaling pathway turned off?  Discuss why once the G protein is activated, it does 
not continuously activate adenylate cyclase.  What chemical reaction is involved in this process? 

c) List two advantages to having multiple steps in a signal transduction pathway. 

d) A turkey odorant molecule comes in contact with the  odorant receptor. Would this 
have an effect on the nerve stimulus being sent from this olfactory cell?  Explain your answer.

Question 3 

You are studying a family with hemophilia, a sex-linked recessive disease, caused by mutations in the Factor 
VIII gene. The Factor VIII gene contains 35 exons. The complete sequence and exon/intron structure of 
this gene are known.  The start codon is in exon 3; the stop codon is in exon 34. 

A partial restriction map and a diagram showing the location of exons 12, 13 and 14 is shown below. You 
synthesize two PCR primers, which anneal to sequences located within exons 12 and 14, as shown. 

Wild-type(normal) Allele: 

HindIII  EagI

PstI

280 bp  180 bp 
150 bp  100 bp 

PCR primer #1 

exon 12 

exon 13

PCR primer #2 

Using these PCR primers, you amplify DNA from a normal male and his hemophiliac brother.  You determine 
the restriction map for the PCR product from these two individuals, shown below:

 PCR-amplified DNA fragment from normal male: 

HindIII 
20 bp

Question 4 

You know in yeast that mitosis takes one hour. You decide to further study the cell cycle in yeast cells using radioactive 
dTTP.  Cells grown in radioactive dTTP incorporate this radioactive nucleotide into their DNA. 

You label a population of asynchronously growing yeast cells by adding radioactive dTTP to the medium for one minute. 
You then replace this medium with medium containing unlabelled dTTP and continue growing the cells. At one hour time 
points following the replacement you count the number of radioactively labeled cells in mitosis.  Your data is shown 
below.

Question 5

A. As discussed in class, the activity of the transcription factor -catenin is important for forming dorsal
structures in the frog. Prior to fertilization, -catenin is synthesized throughout the egg cytoplasm but is
degraded by GSK-3.  GSK-3 can itself be inhibited by the “Dishevelled” protein:

                                                   degrades
         inhibits
Dishevelled  -------------------| GSK-3 protein -------------------| -catenin

Upon fertilization, release of Dishevelled ultimately leads to -catenin activity in specific regions of the
frog zygote. From the graphs below, select the one that most closely approximates the distribution or
activity of the following proteins in the following conditions.

Question 6

ANSWERS

5'-ACTGAC-3' 

G  A  T  C


+ 

a) An end generated by digestion with BamHI can be ligated to an end generated by digestion with BglII.

Why is this possible?

Digestion with BglII or BamHI produce the same overhangs, or sticky ends.  Thus the ends

produced by cutting with BglII are complementary to the ends produced with BamHI, base 
pairing and ligation can occur. 

b) You want to insert the gene encoding the polio antigen into pBAN.  Devise a strategy to accomplish this.

Identify the enzyme(s) you would use to cut pBAN, the enzyme(s) you would use to cut pKR-polio, and the

steps necessary to generate the intact plasmid.

Cut pBAN with BamHI to linearize.

Cut pKR-polio with BglII, this gives a 1400 bp fragment containing the gene for the polio antigen and a 3100

bp fragment.

Size select the DNA from the pKR-polio plasmid to obtain the 1400 bp fragment.

Ligate the 1400 bp fragment together with the cut pBAN plasmid.


c) You next transform E. coli with the plasmids you have made.  You grow the transformed cells on media 
containing (circle one): 
ampicillin 

kanamycin 

both ampicillin and kanamycin 

neither ampicillin nor kanamycin 

Why?  The media should contain ampicillin only, because the plasmid with the promoter and banana insertion 
sequences has a gene for ampicillin resistance. 

d) i) Draw plasmids 1, 2, and 3, indicating all relevant features such as the promoter, the origin of replication, the genes 
for ampicillin resistance and the polio antigen, restriction sites and distances (in base pairs) between the sites.

ii) Which of the three plasmids would allow synthesis of the protein in a banana?  Explain yor reasoning. 

Only plasmid two would allow synthesis of functional protein.

The polio antigen gene must be correctly oriented with respect to the promoter.


Question 2 

a) How does binding of the  odorant molecule stimulate the receptor protein and how does this activate the G

protein?

The binding of a  odorant molecule to the extracellular domain of the receptor changes the

conformation of the protein.  This allows the intracellular domain of the receptor to bind the G 
protein heterotrimer. This binding induces the  subunit to exchange GDP for GTP, activating the  
subunit and releasing it from the  subunit. 

b) Although it might be nice to have the sensation of smelling pie continuously, once the  odorants are gone, 
signaling stops.  How is the signaling pathway turned off?  Discuss why once the G protein is activated, it does 
not continuously activate adenylate cyclase.  What chemical reaction is involved in this process? 
The  subunit of the G protein has an intrinsic GTPase activity.  This activity converts GTP bound to 
the  subunit to GDP. Since the GTP is required for the  subunit to be active, the conversion of 
GTP to GDP deactivates the  subunit of the G protein. The inactive  subunit then can rejoin the 
 subunit to await another signal from the receptor. 

c) List two advantages to having multiple steps in a signal transduction pathway.

Multiple steps in the pathway can provide a large amplification of the signal. It also allows multiple points of

regulation. In addition, if several different receptors work through the same transduction pathway,

integration of different inputs is possible.


d) A turkey odorant molecule comes in contact with the  odorant receptor.  Would this have an effect on the 
nerve stimulus being sent from this olfactory cell? Explain your answer. 

12 

No, a turkey odorant molecule would have no effect on the stimulus from this cell. The  odorant 
receptor specifically recognizes the  odorant. However, the turkey odorant molecule would affect 
olfactory cells specialized for turkey. 

Question 3 
There is a deletion of 330 bp in the DNA, including exon 13 and possibly part of exon 14, which 
also removes a Hind III site and an EagI site
