Question 1 

a) What role does the acrosome have in fertilization? Circle all that apply. 3 pts 

i) It responds to egg’s chemoattractants. 

ii) It has enzymes that digest the zona pellucida. 

iii) It has enzymes that digest the nuclear membrane.


iv) It is the part of the egg that prevents sperm from binding.


v) None of the above.


b) If calcium is injected into an unfertilized sea urchin egg, what would happen? Circle one. 3 points 

i) Capacitation would occur. 

ii) A slow block to polyspermy would be induced. 

iii) The egg will become fertilized without sperm.


iv) The egg will become female.


v) The sperm will undergo an acrosomal reaction.


c) If we now mix sea urchin sperm with these eggs (in b), will fertilization occur? Circle one. 3 
points 

i) No, capacitation has already occurred. 

ii) No, the sperm can no longer attach to the egg. 

iii) Yes, the egg is now in “ready state”.


iv) No, the egg is already fertilized.


v) None of the above.


d) Could a human sperm fertilize a hamster egg? Explain your answer briefly. 5 points 

No, the egg is protected by a thick zona pellucida that can be penetrated only if the ZP3 
ligands within can be bound by the sperm with the appropriate receptor. These interactions 
are species specific. This triggers the acrosomal reaction which spills out hydrolytic enzymes 
to make a passage of the sperm through the Zona Pellucida.

Question 2 

Name______________________________ 

You wish to make your pet glow in the dark so your first step is to clone gfp gene, (encoding green 
fluorescent protein), downstream of the “ON” promoter which is always active, expressing 
downstream genes. You have a vector, the PON plasmid, and you’ve isolated a DNA fragment 
containing a promoter-less gfp gene as well as the tetr gene conferring resistance to tetracycline. 

The vector carries the lacZ gene encoding ß-Galactosidase which converts the substrate, X-gal, 
into a blue colored product. It also carries two antibiotic resistance genes: kanr and ampr which 
r
r
allow for growth on kanamycin and ampicillin, respectively.  The lacZ, kan, and amp genes have 
their own promoters (not shown). Assume all restriction sites are unique unless shown otherwise. 
Assume that only similarly cut DNA ends can ligate with each other. You may use more than one 
enzyme for your cloning. Assume all digestions are complete (no partial digestions).

Question 3 

You want to identify genes that control muscle development. Zebrafish are used to study 
vertebrate development, because the embryos are transparent, abundant and easily 
harvested.  You have two temperature sensitive mutant fish that have mutations in 
unknown genes causing interesting phenotypes you name “Limp” and “Paralyzed”. At 23°, 
these mutant fish eggs develop normally but if they are shifted to the restrictive 
temperature, 30°, within 5 hours after fertilization, the embryos exhibit the limp or 
paralyzed phenotypes. 
You grow the wildtype and mutant embryos at 23°C, and then shift them to 30° at 4 
hours after fertilization. At hour 10, you make sections through the trunk of the 
embryos and identify different cell types that should be present at this stage in 
development with specific dyes.

Question 4 

Early frog embryos undergo several rounds of very synchronous cell division. You decide to use 
them to isolate and study proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. Similar to DNA fragments, 
proteins can be isolated and viewed on gels. 

After inducing the frog eggs to begin synchronous cell division, you remove, at regular time 
points, a portion of the cells to isolate their proteins.  After many different time points you run 
the samples on a gel and observe the following pattern corresponding to one particular protein 
that you name “Fred”. 

0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90

a) Which of the following hypotheses are consistent with this observation? (Circle all that are 
consistent with the data.) 5 points 

i) Fred is required in gap phases.

ii) Fred is required during S phase.

iii) Fred is required before S phase to enable entry into S.

iv) Fred is required during M phase.

v) Destruction of Fred permits cells to exit M phase.


You perform a similar experiment, but this time you add radioactively labeled nucleotides 
and at each time point measure the amount of radioactivity that has been incorporated 
into DNA.  Your data look like this: 

Time (minutes) 
Radioactivity


5  10  15  20  25  30  35 

40  45  50  55  60 


65  70  75  80  85  90

b) Considering  this  observation  and  your previous  experiment,  which  of the following  hypotheses  are 
consistent with  your data?  (Circle  all that are consistent  with  the data.) 3 points 

i) Fred is required in gap phases.

ii) Fred is required during S phase.

iii) Fred is required before S phase to enable entry into S.

iv) Fred is required during M phase.

v) Destruction of Fred permits cells to exit M phase.

c) You perform  the following  additional  experiments. 

Name______________________________ 

Expt. 1) You purify  large  quantities  of Fred that you  inject  into early frog embryos.  You observe  that 
this injection: 

• 

• 

• 

blocks cell division. 
results  in tightly  condensed  chromosomes. 
does not  interfere  with  incorporation  of radioactive  nucleotides  into DNA. 

Expt. 2) You  inject an  inhibitor  of Fred  into early frog embryos.  You observe  that this injection: 

• 

• 

• 

blocks cell division. 
results  in uncondensed  chromosomes. 
does not  interfere  with  incorporation  of radioactive  nucleotides  into DNA. 

Considering  all the results  from  all of your experiments,  which  of the following  hypotheses  are 
consistent with  the data?  (Circle  all that are consistent  with the data.) 2 points 

i) Fred is required in gap phases.

ii) Fred is required during S phase.

iii) Fred is required before S phase to enable entry into S.

iv) Fred is required during M phase.

v) Destruction of Fred permits cells to exit M phase.


d) A colleague suggests that Fred might be degraded when the spindle assembly checkpoint is 
satisfied. You know that nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, disrupts the mitotic 
spindle and arrests cells in prophase.  So you repeat the experiment from part a) using eggs that 
have been treated with nocodazole. Given this information, what pattern do you predict to be 
most likely for Fred if your colleague’s model is correct? 2 points

 0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90

Question 6 

The mammalian visual system works through the pathway shown below.

In the absence of visual stimulus guanylyl cyclase produces cGMP, which opens a sodium channel. 

In the presence of visual stimulus, phosphodiesterase is activated by a G protein, called

transducin.  Phosphodiesterase catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, enabling the sodium ion 

channel to close and sending visual cues (signals) to the brain for processing. 

NO Visual Stimulus 

Visual Stimulus

i) the GDP bound form 
ii) the GMP bound form 
iii) the cGMP bound form 
iv) the GTP bound form 
v) both cGMP and GDP bound forms 

b) At what step(s) in the pathway does signal amplification occur? 4 points 
i) guanylyl cyclase creating GDP 
ii) transducin activating phosphodiesterase 
iii) phosphodiesterase creating GMP 
iv) all of the above 
v) none of the above

Name______________________________ 

The pathway below shows a map kinase cascade that occurs when a growth factor binds 
to its receptor. Activated SOS activates Ras, which in turn activates Raf, which in turn 
activates MEK, which in turn activates MAPK, which results in the synthesis of proteins 
that trigger cell division.

ii) The growth factor receptor degrades upon ligand binding.

iii) Each kinase phosphorylates multiple molecules of its downstream target in the 
pathway. 
iv) The growth factor is degraded upon binding receptor.

v) None of the above.


d) How does Sos activate Ras (a monomeric G protein)? Circle all that apply. 3 points 

i) promotes exchange of GDP for GTP 
ii) promotes exchange of GTP for ATP

iii) promotes hydrolysis of GTP to GMP

iv) promotes hydrolysis of GTP to GDP
