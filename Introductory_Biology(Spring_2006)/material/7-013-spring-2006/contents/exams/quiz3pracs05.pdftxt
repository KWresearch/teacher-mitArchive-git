Question 1 

A)  You infected mice with mouse mammary tumor virus (a retrovirus).  After a period of 
time, most infected mice had developed breast tumors, whereas uninfected mice did not. 
You isolated cell lines from over 50 independent tumors.  You demonstrated that all of 
these lines had virus integrations in the same chromosomal location.  Can one conclude that 
the virus integrates into cellular DNA at only one site?  Explain. 

B) The ras oncogene is involved in a variety of human and animal cancers.  DNA was 
isolated from a number of normal and cancerous tissues. 

-Cellular DNA was digested with Eco RI. 
-Digested DNA was separated by gel electrophoresis and transfered to a nitrocellulose 
membrane. 
-The membrane was probed with the radioactive labelled cloned rasDNA and then the 
membrane was exposed to x-ray film. 
-The resulting autoradiograph is shown below. 

1) white blood cells from a healthy human

2) human lymphoma cells (cancerous)

3) human bladder carcinoma cells (cancerous)

4) human sarcoma cells (cancerous) 

5) blood from a healthy mouse

6) mouse myeloma cells (cancerous)

Question 1 continued 

a) How do you explain the presence of sequences complementary to the oncogene in 
the DNA from healthy human and mouse samples?  Why don't they have cancer? 

b) Why is the hybridizing band from sample 1 a different size than that from 
sample 5? 

c) For each cancer examined above, based on the autoradiogram, choose the most 
likely mechanism of transformation and explain your choice: 

1) point mutation within the gene 

2) chromosomal rearrangement involving the gene 

3) gene amplification 

4) oncogenic retroviral insertion. 

Question 2 

Erythropoietin (EPO), a protein growth factor secreted by the kidneys, is essential for the terminal 
differentiation of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow.  EPO binds to a 
transmembrane EPO receptor found on erythroid precursor cells. 

The following homozygous mutations were made only in the hematopoietic stem cell lineage.  How 
would these mutations affect (increase, decrease, or not change) the number of red blood cells 
formed, compared to the wild-type situation?  Briefly explain your reasoning for each mutation. 
Consider each mutation independently. 

a) A mutation in the EPO gene that resulted in the deletion of only the signal sequence of the EPO 
protein. 

b) A mutation in the EPO receptor gene that resulted in the deletion of only the transmembrane 
domain of the EPO receptor. 

c) A mutation in the EPO receptor gene that resulted in the deletion of only the cytoplasmic domain 
of the EPO receptor.

Question 3 

Part I

factors and allowing them to grow for 2 weeks. Sometimes after incubation of strains you observe 
the following when looking at the side of a culture dish.

Strain B 

a) Which plate shows abnormal cells? Explain.

Question 3 continued 

You learn that cell line 1 is a skin cancer cell line. The region you identified as 
deleted on chromosome 4 in these cells normally contains a gene called p16. 

d) What is the role of the p16 gene product in the normal cell based on the 
information above? 

You obtain another cell line (cell line 3) that has one wild-type copy of chromosome 
4 and one mutant copy of chromosome 4 (as described above in cell line 1). 

e) Will cell line 3 display a cancerous phenotype when grown in the presence of 
growth factors? Yes/No (Circle one.) 

Explain briefly. 

f) Will cell line 3 display a cancerous phenotype when grown in the absence of 
growth factors? Yes/No (Circle one.) 

Explain briefly. 

Part III 

g) Cell line 2 is a breast cancer cell line that expresses a mutant version of a 
receptor protein called KIT. Choose from the following options to explain the role 
of KIT in normal cells. 
Circle one. 

•  Activation of KIT causes cells to undergo apoptosis. 
•  Activation of KIT promotes progression through the cell cycle. 
•  Activation of KIT has no effect on the cell cycle. 
•  Activation of KIT causes cells to enter G0. 

h) Specifically how could a point mutation in the gene encoding the KIT receptor 
cause the abnormal behavior depicted in Part I.

Question 4 
The receptors Robo and DCC are important for axon’s ability to responding to 
guidance cues from Netrin and Slit proteins expressed near the brain midline. The 
mammalian model is summarized below. 

•	 Netrin is secreted from the midline and bound by DCC on the neuron. This

attracts the neuron toward the midline.


•	 Robo is expressed on neurons once they have crossed the midline. 

•	 Slit is secreted from the midline and bound by Robo on the neuron. This 

repulses the neuron from the midline.


•	 DCC receptors on the neurons expressing Robo become non-responsive to 

Netrin binding.

2. Crossing & Moving from the Midline:

b) You’re interested in studying this interaction so you use a convenient model 
organism, the beloved fruit fly. You make mutants in fruit flies that have the robo 
or slit genes knocked out (nonfunctional). Midlines outlined by dashed line. The 
midline sections of these mutants are shown below adjacent to the wild type.The 
nerves are stained and shown to cross the midline in the Wild type neuron.

Question 6 

The bos/seven receptor is required for differentiation of a particular cell, called 
R7.  It is a receptor tyrosine kinase with the structure below. As a monomer, the 
protein is inactive.  Binding of ligand causes the receptor to dimerize, causing 
phosphorylation of the intracellular domain, activating the protein.  During 
processing of the protein, the extracellular domain is cleaved and a disulfide 
bridge forms between two cysteines, tethering the ligand-binding domain to the 
rest of the protein.

a) 
i) How would receptor activity be affected by changing one of the two cysteines 
shown above to an alanine?  Explain. 

ii) What effect would this mutation have on the differentiation of R7? 

b) Name three amino acids that would be likely to be found in the transmembrane 
domain.  What property do those amino acids have in common, and why do they 
cause the transmembrane domain to stay in the membrane? 

10 

d) Draw a schematic of the receptor tyrosine kinase (discussed above) prior to any 
cleavage or modification using the template below.  Include the domains of this 
protein that are required for targeting to and insertion in the plasma membrane. 
Also label the intracellular and extracellular domains. 

N 

C 

e) Activation of the above receptor causes Ras to exchange GDP for GTP, thereby 
activating it.  This activated Ras can activate a signal transduction cascade, which 
ultimately results in the transcription of genes required for R7 differentiation.  In 
different cells in the same animal, Ras can be activated by an activated growth 
factor receptor.  This leads to transcription of genes required for cell division.

ii) Given that these cells exist in the same animal, name one component in the 
pathway that could be mutated to give each of the following results (consider 
each situation independently).  Describe how the mutant component differs from 
the wild-type component, and whether it is a loss-of-function or gain-of-function 
mutation. 

• 

You never see differentiation of R7 cells.

You see uncontrolled cell proliferation.

Answers 
Question 1 

A) One cannot conclude that the virus is able to integrate at only one site.  However, one might propose that 
the virus can only cause cancer when it integrates into a certain chromosomal location or next to a specific 
gene.  In fact, viruses can integrate many places throughout the genome.  The reason you only observed 
integration events at one site is because you have examined only those events that cause tumors.  Perhaps the 
integration of the virus next to a proto-oncogene can cause it to become oncogenic, possibly by activating 
expression of the oncogene in the wrong place or at the wrong time. 

B) 
a) The sequences that are complementary to the probe in normal cell DNA correspond to the cellular proto-
oncogene.  The individuals from that the material came don't have cancer because they have not acquired the 
mutations necessary to turn the proto-oncogene into an oncogene. 

b) Random sequence variation between mouse and human DNA alters the restriction map around the gene.  The 
two species diverged from a common ancestor during the process of evolution, and DNA sequence variation has 
been accumulating since.  Some of these variations occur in restriction enzyme sites. 

c)  -lane 2:  a chromosomal rearrangement or a point mutation at one of EcoRI restriction sites are the most 
probable mechanisms because one copy of the gene has changed its location with respect to at least 
one of the flanking EcoR1 sites. 

-lane 3:  	 a point mutation within the coding sequence of the gene is the probable mechanism of transformation 
because there is no obvious change in the Southern blot--none of the restriction sites have been 
altered. 

-lane 4:  	 gene amplification has created many copies of the gene which probably are present in several tandem 
arrays in the sarcoma DNA. 

- lane 6:  retroviral transduction has brought an extra copy of the oncogene into the cell.  Since the smaller 
fragment is still present in two copies per cell, there has probably not been any change in the 
"resident" proto-oncogenes. 

Question 2 

a) No effect on red blood cell (RBC) formation.  If the EPO signal sequence were deleted, EPO would remain in 
the cytoplasm of the hematopoietic stem cell.  EPO, however, is only made by kidney cells and thus the 
mutation should not affect RBC formation in the bone marrow. 

b) Red blood cell formation would decrease.  Since the CFC-E cell is derived from the hematopoietic stem cell, 
a deletion of the transmembrane sequence would result in the secretion of the EPO-R outside of the CFC-E 
cells, and, as a result, it would not be able to signal the CFC-E cells to grow and differentiate to form 
erythrocytes. 

c)  Red blood cell formation would decrease.  If the EPO-R receptor lacked its phosphorylation site, it cannot 
be activated.  After binding EPO, the activated EPO-R could not signal the CFC-E cell to differentiate into 
erythrocytes. 

Question 3  Part I 

As a premier cancer biologist, you often plate cells in dishes, feeding them serum with growth factors and 
allowing them to grow for 2 weeks. Sometimes after incubation of strains you observe the following when 
looking at the side of a culture dish.

 Strain A 

Strain B 

a) Which plate shows abnormal cells? Explain. 

The plate on the left. Strain A shows no contact inhibition. Normal cells stop 
growing when they touch each other. Abnormal cells pile up. 

b) Predict the behavior of these cell lines if grown without added growth factors by drawing what 
the plates will look like after incubation without growth factors. Simply modify the existing figure 
below for your answer. (Note: one cell from each strain is initially deposited in each dish.)

Question 3 continued 

You learn that cell line 1 is a skin cancer cell line. The region you identified as deleted on chromosome 4 in 
these cells normally contains a gene called p16. 

d) What is the role of the p16 gene product in the normal cell based on the information above? 

It is a gatekeeper of the cell cycle (the brake linings) preventing progression 
through cell cycle unless all checks out. It inhibits cell proliferation. 

You obtain another cell line (cell line 3) that has one wild-type copy of chromosome 4 and one 
mutant copy of chromosome 4 (as described above in cell line 1). 

e) Will cell line 3 display a cancerous phenotype when grown in the presence of 
growth factors? Yes/No (Circle one.) 

Explain briefly. 

No it the p16 mutation is recessive to wild-type. Basically the mutant chromosome 4 gives a recessive 
cancerous phenotype. Cell line 3 has a WT copy of chromosome 4 which is sufficient to give the WT (NORMAl) 
phenotype 

f) Will cell line 3 display a cancerous phenotype when grown in the absence of 
growth factors? Yes/No (Circle one.) 

Explain briefly. 

It will not grow. THERE ARE NO GROWTH FACTORS. Cell line 3’s cancerous phenotype is recessive. (Not 
simply that the cells wouldn’t grow because cell line 3 contains a WT copy of the p16 gene, and enough p16 
protein is present to block proceeding through the cell cycle given the absence of growth factors.) 

Part III 

g) Cell line 2 is a breast cancer cell line that expresses a mutant version of a receptor protein called KIT.

Choose from the following options to explain the role of KIT in normal cells.

Circle one.


Activation of KIT causes cells to undergo apoptosis. 

Activation of KIT promotes progression through the cell cycle. 

Activation of KIT has no effect on the cell cycle. 

Activation of KIT causes cells to enter G0. 

h) Specifically how could a point mutation in the gene encoding the KIT receptor cause the 
abnormal behavior depicted in Part I. 

Any mutation in the receptor that would cause it to be constitutive, ligand-independent activation, 
dimerization, always active, etc. would be enough to cause the cancer phenotype.

Wild type neuron  Slit knockout neuron  Robo knockout neuron 

i) Explain the mechanism that would give mutant “Slit knockout” neurons this pattern? 

Without Slit, neurons are still attracted by Netrin and would not leave the midline area. 

ii) Why is the “Robo knockout” pattern similar to the mutant Slit knockout neurons? 

Not having a ligand (Slit) or a Receptor (Robo) will block the cell signaling pathway controlling 
movement so they will give a similar pattern. 

c) In fruit flies there is another intracellular protein, called Commissureless (Comm), that must be expressed for these 
neurons to cross the midline. The figure below shows different time points from early (A), to later (B), to even later (C). In 
figure B, only neuron 1 is expressing the comm gene, transiently. 

What would an animal with a deletion of both comm genes look like?  Draw your answer in the box below 
elongating the axons of the neurons on either side of the midline.  (Assume Netrin, DCC, Robo and Slit still 
expressed normally.) Axon growth cones never enter midline. 

Midline 

d) Comm is a (Negative/Postive) regulator of the Robo receptor. 
e) Give one example of how intracellular Comm may act on the receptor Robo. 
Comm might bind to the intracellular domain of Robo interfering with signaling, 
or Comm could interefere with something else downstream in the pathway. 
Could destroy the Robo receptor by marking it for degradation. 

17 

Question 5 

a) To become nerve cells 

b) To become either nerve cells or hypodermal cells. 

c) Both X and Y cells have the potential to become nerve cells or hypodermal cells.  This receptor is 
involved in receiving the inducing signal sent by the Z cell to follow the hypodermal cell lineage. 

d) The G protein cannot be activated in these X cells, and thus the signal transduction pathway is 
not active in these X cells.  These X cells are never induced to become hypodermal cells. 

e) X cells require the signal for induction.  In these X cells the G protein signal transduction 
pathway, once activated, remains active and induction occurs. 
Question 6 

a)	

i) This would eliminate the disulfide bridge tethering the ligand-binding 
domain to the rest of the protein. The receptor would be inactive. 

ii) This would prevent the differentiation of the R7 cell type. 

b) Leucine, alanine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, glycine, tryptophan are all 
hydrophobic amino acids. The hydrophobic effect causes these amino acids to 
cluster away from water and stay in the interior of the plasma membrane.

e)	

i)  Ras can activate several different proteins, each of which leads to a 
different signal transduction cascade. Different cells express different 
genes, and the specific protein that a given cell expresses will determine the 
outcome of Ras activation. 

ii)  •	 You never see diferentiation of R7 cells. 
A loss-of function mutation in the boss/sev receptor would prevent 
signaling through Ras and activation of the differentiation pathway. 

•	 You see uncontrolled cell proliferation. 
A gain-of function mutation in the EGF receptor such that it signals to 
Ras in the absence of growth factor would allow uncontrolled cell 
division.
