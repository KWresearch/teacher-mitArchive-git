Question 1

You are a molecular biologist dedicated to preserving rare species from around the world. You
recently started a project to clone the rare blue lobster by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This
lobster is the same species as the normal purple lobster but has a genetic mutation that gives it a
blue exoskeleton.

You are researching action potentials, and so you decide to inject a small amount of Na+ to the 
axon hillock of a hippocampal neuron. When you inject 1 nanogram of Na+ at time point 1, you see a 
small change in membrane potential, but by injecting twice as much at time point 2, you see a 
large change. See the data on the top of the next page.

A stem cell goes through a division once a day to produce another stem cell and a 
precursor white blood cell.  The precursor white blood cell then divides after one day to 
give rise to two differentiated cell types, the T-cell and the B-cell.

You discover a stem cell that has acquired a de novo mutation that prevents it from 
differentiating into T-cells.  As a result, the precursor white blood cells produced from 
this stem cell divide to form one precursor white blood cell and one B-cell. See below.

These mutant cells, when they arise, are normally found in the bone marrow, where they 
are exposed to an abundance of growth factors.  When they are removed from the bone 
marrow and placed in a plastic dish in the absence of growth factors, they cannot grow 
and they die, even though all the nutrients they need are present.  However, in the 
presence of the mutagen EMS, a small number of colonies of cells begin to divide.  Adding 
growth factors, with or without EMS, allows extensive growth. 

Plate A: 
Cells + nutrients 
+ growth factors 

Plate B: 
Cells + nutrients 

Plate C:

growth factors

kylE gene, encoding the KYL-E protein, a monomeric G-protein. Is kylE an oncogene or a 
tumor suppressor gene?  Circle one. 1 point 

kylE is an oncogene. 

kylE is a tumor suppressor gene. 

f) It is known that the receptor, associated with the KYL-E protein, binds to cell growth 
factors, and that signaling through this pathway causes cell growth and division.  Which
