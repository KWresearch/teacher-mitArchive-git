AIDS and the Immune System 
 
In order to understand AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), we need to discuss two 
major biological phenomena: the virus that causes AIDS, known as human immunodeficiency 
virus, HIV, and the cells in the immune system that are by HIV.  Only when both are described 
does the disease begin to make sense.  We begin by extending our earlier description of how the 
immune system works and then examining the details of the life cycle of . 
 
In our earlier discussion of immune cells, we listed two major classes of lymphocytes that 
together carry out the bulk of the functions needed for effective immunity - the B lymphocytes, 
whose descendant make antibodies, and the T lymphocytes.  The disease of AIDS is ultimately 
about T lymphocytes, or rather their loss.    
 
The T lymphocytes (so named because they begin their development and diversification in the 
thymus, the gland near the thyroid gland in the neck) can be further divided into two subclasses: 
the cytotoxic or killer lymphocytes (TC cells) and the helper T cells (TH cells).  The TC cells are 
specialized to recognizeand kill infected or otherwise defective cells throughout the body.  By 
killing a cell recently infected by a virus, for example, the TC cells can abort the viral infectious 
cycle that may have started inside the cell befor the virus has a chance to multiply significantly.  
This is a highly effective way by which the immune system prevents the extensive spread of 
viruses throughout the body. 
 
 
B cell activation 
 
The other class of T lymphocytes, the TH cells, are the central targets of attack by HIV, the 
causal agent of AIDS.  For that reason, we will now elaborate in more detail TH cell function.  
TH cells are not responsible for directly making antibody (the job of the B cells) or for killing 
infected or defective cells (the job of the TC cells).  Their role is instead largely regulatory: the 
TH cells tell the B cells when they should begin clonal expansion and antibody diversification.  
Thus, they control the B cells.  Such control is vital to a well-functioning immune system that 
might otherwise make inadequate or excess antibody in response to antigenic challenge.  An 
outline of how this occurs is pictured schematically in part (a) of Fig. 19.18 in Purves. 
 
In our previous discussion of antibody production, the implication was that foreign protein 
molecules serve as the antigenic stimulus to provoke B cells.  In fact, the provoking antigenic 
stimuli in the immune system are never entire protein molecules, but only fragments thereof.  
These oligopeptide fragments are generated by and displayed on the surface macrophages and 
the B cells.  The macrophages and the B cells can ingest foreign antigenic proteins and cleave 
them into small pieces.  The resulting protein fragments are positioned on the external surface of 
the cell where they serve as the immediate antigenic stimuli that cause B cell clonal expansion 
and antibody production.  A macrophage cell itself has no immunological specificity.  In the case 
of the poliovirus particles discussed in a previous lecture, the macrophage will ingested 
poliovirus, break down the capsid protein molecules into a number of small oligopeptide 
fragments and then export these to its plasma membrane, displaying them on its extracellular 
surface

Now many TH cells come by and look over the oligopeptides that the macrophage is displaying.  
Each of the T helper cells that passes by and examines the macrophage's oligopeptide "wares" 
(as would a shopper in a store) has a very narrow, circumscribed interest in only one particular 
antigen.  When, by rare coincidence, an antigenic fragment displayed by the macrophage is 
recognized by the T helper, the TH cell becomes physiologically activated, and begins a program 
of rapid clonal expansion.  Of course, in the great majority of cases, encounters between the 
helper T cell and macrophages will not result in clonal expansion because the TH cell will not 
happen across the antigenic fragment in which it has a special interest. 
 
 Once the TH cell has undergone physiologic activation and clonal expansion, it will go on to its 
next phase of life, its next job.  It will now seek out B lymphocytes that happen to be interested 
in the very same antigenic fragment.  The B cell's “specialized interest” in one or another antigen 
arises, as described in the immunology lectures, through the unique antibody on the B cell 
surface.  The TH cell, having found a B cell which shares interest in the same oligopeptide 
antigen, will then bind to the B cell and send a signal (via growth factors termed cytokines) to the 
B cell that induces the B cell to become activated and undergo clonal expansion.  The B cell will 
then proliferate in response and produce descendant plasma cells that eventually begin to secrete 
antibody.   
 
In effect, the helper TH cell is saying to the B cell "I have recognized an oligopeptide antigen 
fragment displayed by a macrophage.  I see that you’re interested in the same oligopeptide 
antigen.  The fact that we have both encountered this antigen on separate occasions suggests that 
this is an important antigen against which you must mount a response.  For that reason, I am now 
urging you proliferate and make antibody against this antigenic fragment."   
 
Without this command coming from the TH cell, the B cell will not begin its program of clonal 
expansion and antibody production.  Only now do we begin to sense the vital (albeit indirect) 
role played by the TH cell in antibody production.  
 
 
AIDS 
 
We have all read about the discovery of the AIDS virus, both in France and in the United States 
in 1981.  In the U.S., a cluster of 5 young, homosexual men were discovered who suffered from 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia infections, a disease that was otherwise only known in severely 
immuno-suppressed individuals.  Soon thereafter, it was realized that their immuno-suppression 
was more far-reaching, involving mucosal yeast infections, widespread, disseminated 
cytomegalovirus infections, and chronic peri-anal herpes simplex virual infections.  In addition 
to these debilitating infections, these individuals showed swollen lymph glands and night sweats.  
They also frequently contracted an unusual malignancy - Kaposi's sarcoma (a proliferation of 
cells lining the small blood vessels) - which until then had been encountered in the U.S. only on 
rare occasion and then in old men of Mediterranean (Italian, Greek, Jewish) extraction.   
 
These young men were clearly immuno-deficient, in that they suffered from a variety of 
opportunistic infections, that is, infections by pathogens that surround us constantly, waiting for 
the opportunity to overwhelm the normally very effective immune defense that our bodies have 
erected.  Moreover, the frequency and geographic occurrence of the disease, specifically its 

AIDS and the Immune System 

 

2 

clustering in a small, relatively homogeneous population having a shared lifestyle, suggested that 
the disease was triggered by some type of infectious agent.    
 
Within a two years period of time, the agent responsible for causing the disease, initially called 
HTLV-III or LAV, was isolated in two laboratories - that of Robert Gallo of the U.S. National 
Cancer Institute (HTLV-III) and that of Luc Montagnier (LAV) in Paris.  The present term, HIV, 
for human immunodeficiency virus was chosen as a compromise in nomenclature between the 
two warring camps, each of whom claimed priority in the discovery of the virus and thus the 
right to name it.   
 
 
Earlier Retrovirus Research 
 
How did we come to discover the agent for AIDS so quickly?  The lag between the description 
of a disease and the elucidation of its causative agent encompassed only two short years, almost 
unprecedented in the history of biomedical research.  Usually decades have intervened between 
these two events.   
 
By 1981, we were already well-poised to understand the nature of the infectious agent for AIDS 
for two important reasons:  In 1971, President Nixon signed the War on Cancer Bill, which 
authorized the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to step up its attempts to find the causes of cancer 
- thought then to be retroviruses.  The result was an intensive, decade-long study of retroviruses 
by many research groups, the result of which was a large corpus of information on retrovirus 
replication and a convincing proof that retroviruses were not the cause of most human 
malignancies, as many had anticipated.   
 
The second factor was the continuing obsession of Robert Gallo of the NCI that retroviruses 
were common in humans and were responsible for a wide variety of malignancies.  Even after 
their role as causative agents in human cancers had been disproven, he persisted in his attempts 
to find retroviruses in all types of human pathologic tissues.  Thus, when the AIDS syndrome 
was first discovered, he responded with his usual conviction that it was a disease having, as its 
causative agent, a retrovirus. 
 
 
Retroviruses and their Replicative Cycle 
 
Retroviruses have a most unusual life cycle that we review here in some detail, having discussed 
it briefly earlier in the semester.  Recall that all viruses are really gene packets that move from 
cell to cell, entering a host cell and making more copies of their genes in the infected host cell.  
Dozens, hundreds, or thousands of progeny particles may result from such multiplication.  The 
progeny virus particles then leave the infected host and proceed to infect other host cells nearby, 
continuing the infectious cycle.   
 
The viral genome, either RNA or DNA, controls the ability of the virus to enter cells and 
multiply within them.  In the case of retroviruses, a large class of structurally (and 
evolutionarily) related viruses, the viral genomes are single-stranded RNA molecules, which 
have plus-stranded polarity.  Being (+) stranded, the viral RNA molecules can serve as mRNAs 
when associated with ribosomes.  

AIDS and the Immune System

Recall as well that virus particles, also known as virions, are composed of the viral genomes 
surrounded by a coat.  The virion coat has two functions: to protect the viral nucleic acid genome 
from destruction while the virus particle passes from cell to cell, and to introduce the viral 
genome into an infected host cell, much as a hypodermic needle injects fluid into tissue.  
Introduction of the virion into cells involves several steps, including the initial tethering of the 
virion to the surface of the host cell, and the subsequent physical insertion of the viral genome 
into the host cytoplasm, a process that requires a penetration through the plasma membrane of 
the cell.  In the case of retroviruses, the virion coat, like many other viruses, is composed of a 
lipid bilayer.  Protruding from the lipid bilayer are a series of glycoprotein spikes.  The latter are 
used by the virion for tethering to host cells.   
 
The initial tethering (adsorption) of the virus to an infectable target cell occurs through the 
ability of the viral glycoprotein spikes to bind to specific glycoproteins displayed on the surface 
of the target cell.  Such a target cell protein is termed a receptor for the virus.  The cell receptor 
is always a normal cellular protein that the cell uses routinely for its own biological purposes. 
Viruses take advantage of these pre-existing cell surface proteins and evolve an affinity for them, 
exploiting them as convenient docking sites on the cell surface.    
 
After the virus tethers itself to the surface of the target cell via the receptor molecules, the virion 
must insert its internal contents into the cytoplasm of the target cell.  In fact, the innards of the 
retrovirus virion are composed of more than the single-stranded viral genomic RNA.  In 
addition, a series of viral proteins is assembled in a quasi-geometric icosahedron (much like a 
Buckminster Fuller construction).  The RNA together with the surrounding icosahedral protein 
layer is called the viral nucleocapsid.  
 
Once tethered to the surface, the virus must fuse its own lipid bilayer with the lipid bilayer 
forming the plasma membrane of the target cell.  Only then can the nucleocapsid be injected into 
the cell cytoplasm.  This fusion is also mediated by the viral glycoprotein spikes that were 
involve in the initial tethering.  Once the fusion has occurred, the viral nucleocapsid now is 
firmly ensconced in the cytoplasm of the host cell.   
 
In the case of retroviruses, the nucleocapsid actually carries more than the viral genomic RNA.  
It also contains a copying enzyme, the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme.  Once the 
nucleocapsid is in the cytoplasm, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates made by the cell percolate 
into it.  This allows the RT enzyme to be activated.  It now begins to copy the viral genomic 
RNA. 
 
The process of reverse transcription, as carried out by the RT is more complicated than when the 
enzyme is used by reasearches as a reagent to make cDNAs from an mRNA template.  To begin, 
a (-) stranded cDNA copy of the (+) stranded viral RNA is made.  Then, the RT enzyme 
degrades the RNA portion of the DNA:RNA hybrid formed by the initial reverse transcription.  
Finally, the RT enzyme makes a (+) stranded DNA using the initially formed (-) stranded DNA 
as template.  The end result is a DNA double-stranded helix that contains all the viral genetic 
information.    
 
This viral DNA is then released from the nucleocapsid, transported into the nucleus, and 
covalently inserted into the host cell chromosomal DNA.  Such insertion, the process of 

AIDS and the Immune System 

 

4 

integration, involves cutting and pasting by another virus-encoded enzyme.  This enzyme makes 
a cut at a randomly chosen site in the host cell chromosome and then links the ends of the linear 
viral DNA (recently synthesized by reverse transcription) to the cut ends of the chromosomal 
DNA.  The resulting integrated viral genome, termed the provirus, now assumes a molecular 
configuration equivalent to that of a cellular gene.  The provirus can be transcribed by host cell 
RNA polymerase II, the resulting viral RNA transcripts can be polyadenylated, spliced where 
needed, and exported into the cytoplasm.   
 
These newly synthesized viral transcripts in the cytoplasm can have two alternative fates.  If they 
are unspliced, genomic length RNA, they may be packaged in progeny nucleocapsids.  These 
will then be pushed through the host cell plasma membrane, during which process the lipid 
bilayer and glycoprotein spikes are acquired.  This allows the newly formed virus particle to 
leave the infected cell and go on to infect other cells.   Alternatively, the cytoplasmic viral RNA 
may serve as mRNA templates for the synthesis of progeny virus proteins.  Some of these 
cytoplasmic RNAs may be spliced prior to export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  This 
splicing allows a number of distinct reading frames in the viral genomic RNA to be fused to the 
5’ end of the viral transcript, resulting in a number of distinct mRNAs and hence distinct viral 
proteins.    
 
An aside: The translation of the viral proteins takes place at two sites in the cytoplasm.  The (spliced subgenomic) 
mRNA encoding the viral glycoprotein spikes is translated on ribosomes associated with the rough endoplasmic 
reticulum, and these proteins are inserted into the ER, glycosylated, and exported via the Golgi apparatus to the 
cell surface.  The other viral mRNAs, which make soluble proteins (which form the nucleoprotein core and the 
reverse transcriptase) are associated with free polyribosomes in the cytoplasm.  The viral gene encoding the 
glycoprotein spikes is often termed env (the virion envelope), that encoding the nucleocapsid core is termed gag  
(for group-specific antigens), while that encoding the reverse transcriptase is called pol (for polymerase).   
 
 
 
 
Consequences of the Retrovirus Replication Cycle 
 
The unusual replication cycle of the virus places it in an especially intimate relationship with the 
cell that it infects, particularly with the cell genome.  Here are some of the consequences of this 
peculiar life cycle: 
 
Persistent infections 
If the viral infection does not rapidly kill the cell, which is indeed the case with many types of 
retrovirus infectious cycles, then the virus can persist, in the initially infected cell for an 
indefinite period of time.  For example, the infected cell may produce progeny virus particles for 
an indefinite period of time at a slow, steady rate. Also, since the viral genome, its provirus, is 
integrated into the host cell chromosome, the provirus can be replicated and transmitted like all 
other cellular genes to progeny cells.  Hence, the descendants of an initially infected cell can 
inherit the provirus and they may continue to produce virus particles like the initially infected 
cell did.  
 
Latency   
The provirus, once integrated into the host cell chromosome, may be immediately transcribed, 
resulting in the release of progeny virus particles, or it may be transcriptionally repressed.  This 
will cause the provirus to participate in a latent infection in which its presence will be inapparent 

AIDS and the Immune System

(since no viral proteins, RNA or virus particles will be produced).  Some time later, a 
physiologic signal may awake the provirus from its dormant, latent state, causing it to be 
transcribed after months or years of silence, resulting suddenly in the expression of viral proteins 
and release of virus particles from a cell that seemed, until that moment, to be uninfected.  
 
Germline transmission   
Some retroviruses may infect germ cells (in the ovaries and testes).  As a consequence, the 
resulting proviruses may be transmitted via sperm or egg to the next generation of organisms, 
and thereafter to all lineal descendants.  In effect, the provirus has become a Mendelian gene. 
Such endogenous proviruses may then be activated in an animal that has inherited them, 
resulting in the release of virus particles which may then spread through its tissues via normal 
infectious cycles.  Mice, chickens and cats have many such endogenous proviruses.  For reasons 
that are unclear, no new proviruses have been inserted into the human germline for the past 5-10 
million years (although they were before then into the germlines of our ape-like ancestors).  
Thus, HIV is spread, as far as we know, exclusively through horizontal transmission, that is, 
from one person to another rather than genetically (vertically) from parent to offspring.   
 
 
HIV infection of T lymphocytes  
 
With all this in mind, how does the retrovirus growth cycle help us to understand the process of 
AIDS pathogenesis (the process of causing disease)? To begin, we note that HIV-1 (one of the 
strains of HIV), like many other viruses, has a narrow host range.  That is, it infects only a 
limited range of cells in the body; moreover, it infects only certain Old World monkeys as well 
as ourselves.  In this sense, it is a highly specialized virus.   
 
The cells that HIV-1 infects include largely the helper T cells, certain cells in the monocyte-
macrophage lineage, and certain other cell types.  We will focus here on its effects on TH cells 
that were described earlier.  They are the main targets of HIV attack.  Soon after the discovery of 
AIDS, it became apparent that AIDS patients are immunodeficient in large part because they 
have low and sometimes non-existent helper T cells in their circulation.  This suggested that TH 
cells were eliminated in some way by the AIDS agent. 
 
Some years later, it became apparent why and how HIV specifically targets the helper T cells: 
the receptor that it uses to tether to target cells is the CD4 protein.  As described above, T cells 
associate with both macrophages and B cells.  The CD4 protein normally helps the T cell to dock 
to these two classes of cells.  Therefore, HIV virus exploits a normal TH lymphocyte protein as a 
receptor for binding itself to its target cell.   
 
The CD4 protein is present largely, but not exclusively on TH cells.  Infection of TH cells by 
HIV can be blocked if monoclonal antibody made against CD4 is added to these lymphocytes 
prior to attack by HIV.  The anti-CD4 antibody, by covering up the CD4 molecule, prevents HIV 
particles from accessing the CD4 and tethering themselves to the TH cell surface.  Moreover, 
certain human cells that are usually not infectable by HIV-1 can be converted to infectable cells 
by introducing a cloned CD4 gene into these cells, thereby forcing them to express CD4 on their 
surface.  This might suggest a useful anti-HIV therapy, in which the CD4 proteins of infected T 
cells are blocked with some protective antibody.  But that would not be a useful strategy, since it 

AIDS and the Immune System

would prevent these TH cells from having normal interactions with macrophages and B cells that 
are essential for maintenance of the normal immune response.  
 
HIV may enter into a T lymphocyte and become latent by being transcriptionally silent. Thus, 
the HIV provirus contains at its left (5' end) a transcription promoter termed LTR.  The viral 
LTR promoter contains within it a DNA sequence that serves as a binding site for the cellular 
transcription factor NF-kB.  In resting T lymphocytes, this cellular transcription factor is 
unavailable.  However, if the T lymphocytes becomes functionally activated (as described, for 
example, earlier), then the T lymphocytes begin to make active NF-kB transcription factor as 
part of their normal activation response.  This transcription factor then binds to the viral RNA 
promoter (along with binding to other cellular gene promoters), helps to turn on transcription of 
the provirus, thereby activating and revealing the hitherto latent viral infection.   
 
The consequences of this latency are important for the viral infectious cycle.  The ability of the 
immune system to eliminate infecting viral pathogens like HIV depends in large part on the 
ability of the immune system to recognize and kill virus-infected cells.  But if many helper TH 
cells contain a latent, unexpressed HIV proviruses, then these cells will escape killing by the 
immune system because they are phenotypically normal and outwardly have the appearance of 
being uninfected.  These latently infected cells may harbor the viral infection for years and there 
is no way of knowing where they are in the body and there is no means of selectively eliminating 
these cells.  Months or years later, when a physiologic stimulus (e.g. antigenic stimulation) 
should activate such a latently infected T cell, the virus may then pop out suddenly and trigger 
rounds of infection.  This explains the difficulty of totally ridding the body of HIV once it has 
established itself.   
 
 
Antigenic Variability  
 
The easiest way for the immune system to recognize either an HIV particle or an HIV-infected 
cell is through the presence of the viral glycoprotein spikes that protrude from the HIV virion 
and from the plasma membrane of infected cells.   
Recall that: 
1) 
the infected cell membrane displays these viral glycoproteins;  
2) 
the viral nucleocapsid in the cytoplasm forces its way through the plasma membrane; and  
3)  in the course of pushing its way out of the cell, the nucleocapsid coats itself with a lipid bilayer 
containing these viral glycoprotein spikes.)   

 
The viral glycoprotein contains several regions that are highly antigenic, that is, attract most of 
the attention of the immune system by eliciting antibody responses.  Once the immune system 
makes antibodies against the viral glycoprotein antigenic regions, these antibodies can either 
bind to virus particles and neutralize/inactivate them or they can bind to the surface of HIV-
infected cells, facilitating the elimination of these infected cells by other immune cells (such as 
macrophages).  This explains why the production of anti-virion antibody is useful in establishing 
an anti-viral response.  
 
However, the virus makes itself into a moving target that is continually eluding the immune 
system.  In particular, HIV is capable of changing the amino acid sequences of these antigenic 
regions of the glycoprotein spikes from month to month and year to year - a form of constant 
microbial guerrilla warfare.  This continually results in the appearance of new variant strains of 

AIDS and the Immune System 

 

7 

HIV in an infected individual that are no longer recognized by the existing repertoire of 
antibodies that this person’s immune system has mustered until then.  As soon as his/her immune 
system has a chance to make antibody against one variant of the glycoprotein, the virus pops up 
with a novel glycoprotein version.  The new version is not recognized by the existing antibody 
and as a consequence, escapes antibody attack until the immune system catches up with it days 
or weeks later.  Poliovirus, by contrast, is not antigenically variable and immunity established 
against one form of poliovirus results in lifelong protection against reinfection. 
 
This changeability of the viral glycoprotein antigen is made possible by the mutability of the 
viral genome. The reverse transcriptase enzyme is rather sloppy, creating frequent copying errors 
during reverse transcription. This leads in turn to a high frequency of mutant glycoprotein genes, 
some of which specify novel antigenic variants of HIV that escape existing immune defenses and 
multiply unhindered for a period of time until the immune system catches up with them. 
 
For this reason, the progression of an HIV infection over many years is marked by a series of 
episodes in which the virus bursts out, replicates, is brought under control by the immune 
response, only to have a new round of infection start up by an antigenic variant months later.  
Eventually the immune system's defenses are worn down to the point that HIV replication is 
unimpeded.  By this time, the helper T cells have become so depleted (see below) that the body 
is now wide open for attack by a variety of viral, bacterial, and fungal agents that create the 
devastating infections seen in AIDS patients.   
  
 
Cell Killing  
 
Unexplained by all this is the mechanism by which HIV actually kills helper T cells that it has 
infected.  The very process of making progeny virus particles is lethal for many types of virus-
infected cells.  In the case of poliovirus, the process of making hundreds of thousands of viral 
progeny particles depletes the cell of many of its normally required macromolecules.  But in the 
case of HIV infection, the mechanisms of the viral cytopathic effects are more varied and subtle. 
 
One explanation of HIV’s cytopathic effects comes from a reexamination of the functions of the 
viral glycoprotein.  Recall that in addition to its ability to adsorb to a cell surface by tethering to 
the CD4 protein, the glycoprotein also has an ability to fuse the lipid membrane of the virion 
with the plasma membrane of the infectable target cell. In the case of a helper T cell that is 
actively producing progeny virus particles, its plasma membrane is studded with HIV 
glycoprotein spikes, many of which will eventually be picked up by progeny HIV particles on 
their way out of the cell.    
 
These viral spikes may already be functionally active while they are on the surface of the virus-
infected cell, even before they have become incorporated into progeny virus particles.  The 
consequences of this can be devastating for the cell.  First, they will cause the surface of the 
virus-infected cell to adsorb to that of other, still uninfected helper T cells displaying CD4 
protein on their surface.  Second, the fusogenic activity of the viral glycoprotein spike will cause 
this cell to fuse with such uninfected helper T cells.  Indeed, this cycle can be repeated over and 
over, resulting in the fusion of the infected cell with dozens if not hundreds of uninfected helper 
T cells.  The results with be a multi-nucleated syncytium which is non-viable.  The cells in such 
a syncytium will die after several days.

The History of an HIV infection 
 
We can now assemble and integrate all of the above information into a reasonably coherent 
picture of how HIV begins its infectious cycle in an individual.  It is usually transmitted from 
person to person through blood or semen.  In both cases, the bulk of the transmission seems to 
occur by passage of infected cells rather than by free-floating virus particles. 
 
Once inside the body, virus is released from the introduced infected cells, largely infected TH 
cells.  HIV begins rounds of infection, largely in the TH cells of the lymphoid organs (e.g. lymph 
glands, spleen) of its newfound host.  This results in an acute phase infection, in which high viral 
titers (high concentration of free virus in the blood) can be detected in the recently infected 
individual several weeks post-infection.  After several more weeks, the viral titer drops 
precipitously.  This is drop is due to an immune response that the still largely intact immune 
system of the host individual mounts.  Two immunologic mechanisms are used to reduce the 
viral titer: cytotoxic T lymphocytes (TC cells) are produced which kill off the great majority of 
HIV-infected TH cells.  Later on, the B cells of the host produce high titers of anti-HIV antibody. 
 
Now the HIV infection goes underground, or at least seems to.  Large numbers of latently 
infected TH cells can be found for a number of years.  While the viral titer in the blood is 
reduced, actively replication of HIV continues however in a number of lymphoid organs such as 
lymph glands.  In such individuals, as many as 107 to 109 virions may be produced per day and 
eliminated (perhaps by antibody neutralization) almost as soon as they are produced.  Occasional 
flare-ups of high viral titers (viremia) may occur as HIV variants evolve new glycoprotein 
antigens and temporarily evade the existing immune response.  All the while, as many as 2 x 109 
TH may be killed throughout the body each day! 
 
For a number of years (highly variable from one infected individual to another), this enormous 
death rate of TH cells is compensated by an equally large proliferation of TH cells, resulting in a 
semblance of a stable, steady-state infection.  Sooner or later, however, the ability of the immune 
system to replenish the ranks of the TH cells is exhausted, often irreversibly.  Then the number of 
TH cells plummets and the overall functioning of the immune system collapses, for reasons 
described earlier.  One of the first consequences is the inability of the immune system to 
continue to suppress the HIV infection, leading the virus to break through the immune defense 
barriers that have held it in check for years.   
 
Soon opportunistic infections by other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens strike various sites 
throughout the body.  The Kaposi’s sarcoma frequently observed in homosexuals but rarely in 
those infected by blood transfusions may be caused by sexual transmission of a recently 
discovered herpes virus-like agent termed HHV-8.  Lymphomas may also occur at high rates, a 
common occurrence in individuals with a compromised immune system.  These days, lifespan 
and a reasonable quality of existence can be extended for a number of years using antibiotics, 
antifungal agents, and chemotherapy, converting AIDS into a chronic disease for this period.  
But in the great majority of cases (>99%), the end is clear, sad and inescapable.
