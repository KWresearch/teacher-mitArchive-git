Transcript â€“ Lecture 23 

Differentiation.  For someone who didn't see the board.  Yeah? 

Yeah.  So what a cell will become eventually.  And differentiation is the process 
by which it becomes that. 

OK.  Good.  So these terms are essential for you to know for today's lecture. 
And if they are a little murky for you then you should really make sure they 
become clear.  OK.  I'm going to talk to you today about stem cells.  This is the 
how-to module, our second how-to module.  We have two lectures, stem cells 
and cloning. 

And what I want to do today is to go beyond the media, beyond the hype and tell 
you about stem cells, what we really know and why there is such a fuss about 
them.  And to put it in perspective of where you are in the course, in our game 
board of life we're moving right along past foundations up through formation and 
now into our second how-to module.  So let's start with a question.  And you have 
a handout.  If you do not have a handout, Shamsah,  could you be mail person? 
And on the other side it looks like we need another mail person.  You will realize 
that I typically do give you a handout of the most important slides so that you 
don't have to grapple with things and that you don't, in fact, have to print out the 
PowerPoint handout before you come.  So you should always just check.  OK. 
So what is a stem cell? 

Well, a stem cell is something that has two important capacities.  Firstly, it can 
self-renew.  That's a very popular term.  It can make more of itself.  And, 
secondly, it can give rise to a number of different, one or more different cell fates. 
So it can give rise --

-- to one or more differentiated cell types.  Schematically, I've represented it for 
you in this way.  So here is something that's called an uncommitted stem cell. 
And you should be familiar with the term uncommitted, naive and so on. 

And this uncommitted stem cell can undergo cell division to make more of itself. 
And it can also go on to become something that's termed in the field a 
"progenitor cell".  It's just a term.  It means a cell that is going to give rise to 
something else.  And I've depicted it here as a determine progenitor.  It knows 
what it's going to become.  And this term uncommitted stem cell, the 
uncommitted part is a little misleading.  I'll talk about that more in a moment. 

This determined progenitor then goes on to give rise to a whole bunch of one or 
more, actually, differentiated cell types.  And the number of cell types that a stem 
cell can go on to give rise to is a measurement of its potency.  That is the 
definition of the term potency.  So this is the notion of the stem cell concept.  You 
have this.  It's the first figure on your handout.  And you'll find this in many 
newspaper articles and books. 

So what's so special about this and why are there newspaper articles and 
newspaper articles and newspaper articles and television programs and covers 
of Time Magazine about stem cells?  What's the hype?  Well, the deal is that it is 
believed by some that stem cells are going to be some kind of universal repair 
kit. 

That somehow because stem cells can give rise often to differentiated cell types 
and make more of themselves that they are in a position to repair parts of the 
body when the body needs repair.  You have a heart attack, you throw in some 
stem cells, repair the heart, you have a brain lesion, you throw in some stem 
cells and you repair the damage.  And if you go through the newspapers, as I did 
very, very briefly, it's very easy to find many, many different headlines. 

One of the big ones last week, I'll talk about this at the end, is that the 
Massachusetts House passed a law expanding the use of stem cells in research. 
Hopkins is beginning human trials with donor adult stem cells to repair muscle 
damage from heart attack.  This is an enormous amount of interest in these cells 
because of this notion of universal repair kit-ness.  There are also 
advertisements. 

The Stem Cell Bank and the Cord Blood Registry would love you to pay them to 
save your child's umbilical cord stem cells, or the blood cells from a newborn's 
umbilical cord in the possibility that you'll use these later on to save the life of this 
child or somebody else.  And the other reason that stem cells have got so much 
hype is that, as we'll discuss towards the end of the lecture, they involve the use, 
or are likely to involve the use of human embryos. 

And that's a real fire point.  But let's step back and let's talk about stem cells and 
biologically what are these things and what do you need them for?  And the thing 
we have to consider is the question of organ maintenance.  Now, I've told you 
several times, oh, you see, it popped up.  There you go.  We have to give these 
frogs a moment to pop up. 

OK.  That must have been somebody's frog that popped up.  I've told you several 
times that our bodies consist of about ten to the twelfth cells.  That's a lot of cells. 
But it's actually much worse than that because it is not the same ten to the twelfth 
cells that you started with, once you got there, that you keep throughout your life. 
The cells in your body are constantly dying and are constantly being replenished. 

And, in fact, if you look at your ten to the twelfth cells, over the course of your 
lifetime you will make many times ten to the twelfth cells.  You're not going to 
replace every cell in your body because some of them life forever, but for many 
populations of cells in your body you will replace those organs completely.  OK? 
So we're talking about making lots and lots of cells.  And the issue really is one of 
organ and tissue maintenance. 

And if one considers how organs and tissues are maintained, they fall into three 
categories loosely.  Those that have a high turnover rate where cells do not live 
for very long and need to be replenished rather frequently to maintain the size 
and function of the organ. 

Those organs that have a low turnover rate and those that are said to be static. 
Organs with a high turnover rate include, as I'll tell you a moment, the blood, 
some of your hair.  Organs with a low turnover rate include things like your liver 
and pancreases.  And organs that were thought to be static, but in fact that may 
not be true, was the nervous system.  And now we know that that's not true. 

So let's talk about how we get to these terms.  High turnover.  Low turnover.  Let 
me just write it out.  Turnover.  And static natures of organ maintenance.  And the 
way we do this, or the way this has been done is by an assay that's called a 
pulse-chase assay. 

And a pulse-chase assay, and this is the second slide on your handout, goes like 
this.  In a cell population one can add a nucleotide analog bromodeoxyuridine. 
It's uridine but it's incorporated into DNA because it's got that deoxy there.  And 
bromodeoxyuridine is a nucleotide that is incorporated and can then be detected 
using various stains. 

So you can tell which cells have incorporated BrdU by staining them 
appropriately.  So you can tell which cells are dividing, which cells have gone 
through S phase by whether they are labeled or not.  And if you give a cell 
population a short pulse, if you give BrdU for just a short time, this is called a 
pulse, it gets incorporated into the DNA, and then the BrdU is gone.  And so you 
label your cell population.  And then you follow the cells over a long time without 
any added label. 

And so the only cells you look at are the ones that were labeled during this pulse 
period.  And if you do that, you see that your initially labeled cell population lives 
for a while, and then the cells start to disappear because they die.  And you can 
monitor the half-life a population by counting how long cells live for.  OK?  So this 
is a pulse-chase analysis.  And this will give you the cell turnover time of a 
particular organ. 

And this is very useful in trying to figure out whether cells have a high turnover 
rate or a low turnover rate.  Now, you can do something else with this.  You can 

look at your labeled cell population, and you can actually look not just at the 
numbers of cells but you can look at what those cells become.  And sometimes 
your initially labeled cell population will be the final form, the differentiated state 
of the cells, but sometimes it won't.  And then it's very informative to follow that 
labeled cell population and see what they do. 

This is your third handout, your third slide on your handout. And if you follow 
them you might see that this labeled cell population, during the chase, 
differentiates into something.  And that's very interesting.  And then later on those 
cells will die and you'll be able to measure a half-life as previously, but this is very 
interesting because it tells you that this labeled cell population was not the same 
as the final fate of the cells. 

And it implies that there is some kind of precursor cell, some kind of progenitor in 
your labeled cell population that's giving rise to the differentiated cells.  And it 
implies that these initially labeled cells either are stem cells or are progenitors 
derived from stem cells that are responsible for repopulating a tissue as the 
tissue or organ needs to be maintained. 

So these are two assays that are very useful and are used to, have been used to 
define high turnover organs.  So what are some of these organs that have, or 
tissues that have high turnover? 

In fact, they've been used, these assays have been used to define many tissues, 
those with high and those with low turnover.  But it's the high turnover ones I 
want to talk about.  The red blood cells in your body have a turnover time, half-
time of about 120 days. 

And if you do the calculation, because you have a lot of red blood cells, you're 
making more than a billion cells a day.  OK?  As you are sitting here, you are 
probably, during the course of this lecture, making several million new red blood 
cells.  Your intestine, some of the cells in your intestine that are responsible for 
food absorption turnover every three to five days. 

Your skin cells, the epidermis of your skin turns over with a half-life of about 14 
days.  And your hair, depending on where it comes from, turns over with a half-
life of about 14 days to about four years. 

And the sense in many of these organs, and I'll go through this a bit more in a 
moment, is that this high turnover and the replenishment of these cells as they 
disappear is driven by a stem cell population.  And I'm going to abbreviate stem 
cells SC.  And I'm going to put forth the hypothesis that stem cells replenish 
these organs. 

Now, in some cases you can actually look at the organ and you can do your 
pulse-chase, just like I told you, and you can see that this must be so.  And an 

example that we've talked about previously, not in this context but previously is 
the testes, the spermatagonia are the cells sitting right at the edge of the 
seminiferous tubule, which we'd label with BrdU.  And as you do your chase you 
would see those cells as labeled cells moving towards the lumen and 
differentiating into the stem cells.  OK? 

And so you can actually see those cells giving rise to the differentiated cells. 
Another tissue where this is very beautiful is in the epidermis of the skin.  So the 
epidermis of the skin comprises multiple layers stacked up on top of each other. 
And as you get towards the outside of the epidermis, the cells in the outer layers 
are dead and they form the layer that we feel as skin.  But, in fact, there are a lot 
of cells that are living underneath the outer layer. 

In the very deepest layers of the epidermis reside a dividing population of cells 
that are, that include the stem cells, and I'll show you an assay for some of this in 
a little bit.  These dividing cells, if you follow them, give rise to the cells in the 
layers above.  So they either are the stem cells or they are progenitor cells that 
are replenishing the epidermis.  Now, in the blood, I told you that you can do a 
pulse-chase assay. 

And you can very accurately measure the half-life of red blood cells.  And it's 
clear that red blood cells must come from some precursor.  In ourselves, in most 
vertebrates, in many vertebrates red blood cells do not have nuclei so they 
cannot divide themselves.  And so there must be some kind of progenitor.  But 
the progenitors of red blood cells and, in fact, many other cells in the blood lie 
deep within the bone marrow, the cavity of the bones.  And so you really cannot 
observe them well to come to the conclusions that I've just given you about the 
testes and the epidermis of the skin. 

So you have to do some kind of other assay to figure out where these cells are 
coming from.  And over the years a huge body of data has given rise to this 
notion.  In the bone marrow of the long bones, and some of the shorter bones, 
too, there is some kind of pluripotential or pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, 
that I've abbreviated HSC. 

And this HSC gives rise, through a series of progenitors which then go on to 
differentiate, into all of the cell types that are found in the blood.  The red blood 
cells.  The so-called white blood cells.  The immune cells.  A huge spectrum of 
differentiated cell types. 

And this hematopoietic stem cell has been very, very useful in helping people 
who have got blood associated illnesses in that it can, after removal of diseased 
blood cells, it can repopulate the tissue and help people get better.  And it's done 
so, and I'll go through how this is done both in an assay sense and point out that 
this is exactly what's done in humans, it's done so in a bone marrow transplant. 
So in assays, let's just write down a couple of things here. 

I've told you one assay already for stem cells. 

OK?  So assays for stem cells ask how do you know if you've got a stem cell? 
Well, you can do that.  You can ask this using the pulse-chase by direct 
observation with your pulse-chase. 

You can also do it by a repopulation assay.  And the notion in a repopulation 
assay is that you try to restore a particular cell type by putting in what you think is 
the precursor of that cell type.  Now, in order to do these assays you usually 
have to get rid of the normal cells that were there so that you can assay your 
repopulation. 

OK?  Otherwise, the normal cells can out-compete the cells you're putting in. 
OK?  But that's an aside.  So what is a bone marrow transplant?  The notion here 
is that one takes an animal, and this is done in humans, and you irradiate the 
animal so that you destroy all its bone marrow.  This will eventually kill the 
animal, OK, because you cannot live without a hematopoietic stem cell and 
without all the cells that derive from that. 

And so, although this irradiated animal would die, you can rescue it by injecting 
normal bone marrow.  You inject it into a mouse in the tail vein, into people it 
goes into a central line that goes into your blood system.  And then those bone 
marrow cells, it's extraordinary, know where to go.  They home to the bone 
marrow and they repopulate it and they make again the hematopoietic stem cell 
and all the lineages that come from that. 

Or they are the hematopoietic stem cell, they maintain themselves and they give 
rise to all the other lineages.  One of the criteria that I told you about stem cells is 
that they need to be self-renewing.  You can ask whether or not these stem cells 
are self-renewing in an assay like this, where you take a mouse that you've 
rescued by bone marrow transplant, and you can ask whether it can serve as a 
source of marrow of hematopoietic stem cells that will rescue another irradiated 
mouse. 

In other words, you could have rescued that first mouse just by giving it a whole 
spectrum of almost differentiated red blood cells, white blood cells, immune cells 
and so on.  OK?  In order to test whether you actually rescued it by giving it a 
stem cell, you can ask whether or not you can take this rescued mouse and use 
it to rescue another mouse.  And, in fact, you can. 

And this is consistent with, not unequivocal, but it's consistent with a sense that 
you have generated more stem cells in the rescued mouse that can go on to 
rescue another mouse.  Another set of experiments that has been really pivotal in 
understanding stem cells is to try to purify the stem cells and to assay what are 

these pure stem cells.  And part of this is asking how many cells do you need to 
rescue in a repopulation assay? 

OK.  And so let me make a note here. 

That when it comes to stem cell isolation the overriding conclusion from many 
assays done by many labs is that stem cells are rare and they are hard to find. 

In this experiment, which is number five on your handout, you can assay for how 
many stem cells you need to rescue a mouse by removing bone marrow from 
one mouse and staining that bone marrow, if you can, for a stem cell marker. 
Now, what is a stem cell marker?  OK?  If I have a stem cell marker I would be 
able to go and pull out the stem cells.  Well, there are no markers.  A marker 
could be a protein or an RNA that is expressed in a particular group of cells that 
you suspect are the stem cells. 

OK?  This is very much an experimental-driven field.  There are markers that 
always appear, proteins that are always there, antigens on the surface stained 
with antibodies that are always there where you have a population of cells that is 
able to rescue a mouse.  And so you can use these to hypothesize that this stem 
cell marker is, in fact, marking the stem cells. 

And you can go and purify cells that are expressing a particular marker.  And the 
way you do this is by using a really fantastic machine called the Fluorescence 
Activated Cell Sorter (FACS).  I'll go through it very briefly in a moment.  But what 
it is able to do is to purify cells that have got particular fluorescences.  And they 
have these particular fluorescence spectra because of the way you have stained 
them for particular stem cell markers. 

And what you get out of your FACS machine is a population that is much more 
enriched for what I've called stem cells, but they're actually cells that are 
expressing this punitive stem cell marker.  And then you can take these cells and 
say, well, have I really enriched for the stem cell, by asking how many cells you 
need to introduce into an irradiated mouse to rescue that mouse.  And you can 
do a dilution assay where you put in one cell, ten cells, a hundred cells. 

Obviously, when you're down in the one cell range, you do your dilution assay, 
you get into a Poisson distribution, and you may not have exactly one cell.  But 
you can do this statistically and you can figure out how many cells from your 
population it takes to rescue a mouse.  OK?  And the data to date tells us that 
one cell of the correctly purified population is sufficient to rescue an irradiated 
mouse.  You have to do some tricks. 

You have to add some extra cells to this one cell.  You cannot just put one cell 
into the mouse and rescue.  You have to mix this one cell with some other cells 
that help it do its work.  OK?  But this is really an extraordinary assay that tells us 

we're very close to purifying a hematopoietic stem cell.  What is a FACS 
machine?  Very briefly.  You can look at this later.  Cells that are labeled with 
fluorescent antibodies are broken up into a stream of tiny droplets each of which 
will contain one cell. 

And the cells then pass in a stream through a laser which activates the 
fluorescence.  There's a fluorescence detector that you can program to respond 
to a particular wavelength.  And what happens is that when the detector finds 
that it has responded to a cell passing through it because of the fluorescence 
emitted, a charge is given to that cell, and that cell with a particular fluorescence 
moves down the stream through some deflecting plates where it will be deflected, 
according to its charge, into a collecting bin. 

And that way you can really get some very highly purified cell populations.  You 
can purify about 300,000 cells an hour using the FACS machine.  And we have a 
lot of them here at MIT and use them.  Many laboratories use them for various 
things.  A really cool machine.  OK.  But we need to move on.  So we talked 
about some assays for stem cells. 

Talked about the potency of hematopoietic stem cells.  I want to tell you 
something now about the control of stem cells and how a stem cell decides what 
to do.  So if you think about organ maintenance, there is an implicit 
understanding that the organ knows how much it needs to be maintained.  It 
needs to know how many cells are being lost, it needs to know when to make 
more cells, and it also needs to know if there has been some catastrophe. 

If there's been a liver, some kind of a resection of the liver, or if there has been 
skin wounding, OK, the organ needs to be able to respond.  And the stem cells in 
an organ need to be able to respond to this catastrophe.  And this is where this 
term niche comes in.  Niche is one of these fields in the term, terms in the field. 
It's like the term progenitor. 

And niche is nothing that you haven't heard about before.  What it refers to are 
the cells, as written up there, that surround the stem cell.  And what I'm going to 
tell you is that the niche cells, the surrounding cells control, by induction, stem 
cell fate.  And I'm also going to point out that there can be some input of the 
environment. 

So this is a cartoon that I drew for you.  It's number six on your handout.  It's six 
across on your handout.  And I have here some stem cells that I've called 
quiescent.  They are not dividing.  Or they may be dividing just a little bit just to 
maintain themselves but not to give rise to any progenitors that will go on to 
differentiate.  And these quiescent cells are maintained in this quiescent state, 
we believe, because they are surrounded by a group of cells that is maintaining 
them quiescent. 

What happens then is that these quiescent cells sometimes get a stimulus, some 
kind of environmental input, be it wounding, be it some kind of hormonal input 
from another part of the body that influences the surrounding cells and changes 
the surrounding cells such that they now change their patterns of gene 
expression and start secreting stuff, most likely, that changes the activity of the 
stem cells that they are surrounding. 

I've shown you arrows there indicating induction from the stem cells, from the 
surrounding cells to the stem cells.  And what this inductive process does, just 
like in the early embryo is to activate the stem cells to divide and to form 
progenitor cells which will go on to do their thing and differentiate into various 
fates. 

And also, of course, the stem cells are renewed.  So this notion of the 
surrounding cells telling the stem cells what to do is kind of new in the stem cell 
field.  If one is a developmental biologist, it's one of these, OK, kind of 
observations because we know that cells signal to one another.  And it's not 
surprising that stem cells are told what to do by the cell surrounding them. 

But there has been not very much information on this.  And I want to give you 
one system where it's been very  beautifully looked at and where the contribution 
of the surrounding cells has been looked at.  And this system is the hair follicle. 
So your hairs come from a sheath of cells that starts off in the epidermis and 
moves deep down, extends deep down into the deeper layers of the skin called 
the dermis. 

And there is a shaft of cells of which these matrix cells down here are important 
because these matrix cells divide and they give rise to cells that will form the 
center of the shaft and secrete, or not secrete but synthesis proteins called 
keratins.  The keratins are this stuff.  And eventually the cell gets so full of keratin 
that it dies.  And at the same time more cells are coming in the bottom here and 
this whole shaft, this whole hair shaft is pushed out of the hair follicle. 

OK?  And so that is why your hair grows.  It has been pushed out from the 
bottom.  And all the stuff that we are so fond of is dead cells.  It's actually protein. 
It's a very interesting polymer of various keratins.  Now, what's very interesting 
here is that over the years researchers have shown that the hair, well, let me 
back track for a moment. 

You know your hair falls out, right?  You brush your hair and your hair falls out. 
OK?  Ergo, it must be replenished somehow.  And over the years it has been 
shown that these bulge cells, or cells in a little bulge, which was a rather 
insignificant little bulge but it's there, sitting on the side of the hair shaft is actually 
the source of the stem cells for the hair.  And another region, I'm going to tell you 
about in a moment, is down here.  It's labeled DP.  Bear it in mind as I tell you 
something and then we'll come back to it. 

So let me first show you some data that tells us that the bulge cells are the cells 
that contain or that include the stem cells for making hair.  One can do an 
experiment where one takes these bulge cells and does essentially a 
repopulation assay, just as in the case of the bone marrow transplant.  And one 
can do this into a strain of mice called nude.  So nude mice have got multiple 
issues. 

But one of their issues is that they have no fur.  OK?  And one can take bulge 
cells from a normal mouse and transplant them into a nude mouse.  Here's the 
control transplant, and you can see there's no fur.  And here is a transplant of 
bulge cells from a normal mouse.  And here you see this tuft of fur growing out 
on the back of the nude mouse.  And, in fact, some very cool assays have been 
done where these transplanted cells are labeled green.  And you can look at 
these tufts of fur and see them growing fluorescently green. 

So you know that the new fur came from the transplanted cells.  OK.  So what 
about niche?  Well, you know that your hair falls out.  But, actually, there's a lot 
more to it than that.  And it turns out there is a whole hair cycle of when the hair 
grows and when it doesn't grow.  And it goes like this.  There's a time called 
anagen which is a period of growth when these matrix cells down here are 
dividing and they are pushing out this hair and it's growing. 

After a while the cells down here stop dividing and the hair follicle doesn't grow 
anymore, or the hair shaft doesn't grow anymore.  This is called catagen.  And 
it's a time that's termed regression.  It is when there is no more growth.  And if 
the hair is going to fall out, it might fall out then, or it might stick around and the 
next step might take place. 

And this is a step called telogen which is a resting state.  And then after that 
there is a new state, a new anagen where the hair will start growing again.  And it 
may either be a new hair or it may be the one that's there that just grows longer. 
It depends on the part of the body.  OK.  Now, what I'm going to tell you is that a 
region called the dermal papilla induces stem cell activation at certain times 
during the hair cycle. 

So look at this.  At anagen, during growth, the bulge and this dermal papilla, OK, 
this DP, it doesn't matter what the name is but just look at the red, are far apart 
from each other.  At catagen they're still far apart, but look at what happens at 
telogen in this resting stage.  The dermal papilla and the bulge are touching one 
another.  And this is the phase, although it's called a resting phase, this is the 
phase when the hair follicle is actually getting ready for the next big spurt of cell 
division and differentiation that is going to make the hair longer or make a new 
one grow. 

And then, subsequently, the dermal papilla and the bulge stay close together, but 
eventually they will start pulling apart again.  Well, it's been shown very elegantly 
that this dermal papilla signals to these bulge cells when they're touching one 
another and tells the bulge stem cells to activate and start making more hair or a 
new hair follicle.  And the signaling is done through a pathway called the wnt 
signaling pathway. 

And I point this out because it uses a protein that should be familiar to you, which 
is our old friend beta-catenin that we talked about way back when as being 
important for dorsal-ventral patenting in the early embryo.  And I point it out to 
you to make the point that proteins are used over and over again.  Regulatory 
proteins can be used over and over again in the body.  OK.  So this is a very 
lovely example of what happens in a stem cell niche. 

So let's move on and let's ask how plastic adult stem cells are.  OK.  So here we 
have some issues.  Well, the goal of the medical community is to get a stem cell 
that can repair every tissue.  And it may be that every adult tissue has a stem cell 
population in it, but these can be difficult to isolate.  It's very difficult to isolate 
these hair stem cells. 

You can get enough to get tufts of hair on another mouse, but it's hard to get 
enough of them to repair someone's bald head for example.  OK?  So the Holy 
Grail of stem cell-ness is to try to find a cell that is a multi-potent adult progenitor. 
OK?  And this has been the real goal of the adult stem cell field. 

And the question that has been posed is, is there a multi-potent, a highly plastic, 
multi-potent also termed plastic, adult stem cell?  And if there was then in theory 
one could use it to repair all organs. 

So here again is our stem cell concept where some kind of stem cell goes on to 
give rise to a set of differentiated cells.  Now, the set of differentiated cells forms 
what's called a lineage where all the cell types that come out of a single stem cell 
are related to one another because they come from a common heritage, from a 
common progenitor, from a common stem cell.  And you can, for different 
lineages, make different trees of stem cells progenitors and differentiated 
progeny. 

And it has been hypothesized that there is some kind of interconvertibility 
between different stem cells in the adult, and that one stem cell for one lineage 
can be under the right circumstances converted to a stem cell for a different 
lineage.  And that maybe there's even some kind of master stem cell floating 
around in the adult that can give rise to all other stem cells. 

Maybe there is some totipotent or pluripotent very, very highly potent adult stem 
cell that can give rise to all these other stem cell lineages and can, therefore, be 
used as this universal repair kit.  And this has been assayed.  And the prediction 

from this is that adult stem cells from one lineage, for example the hematopoietic 
lineage, can contribute to another lineage.  For example, the muscle cell lineage. 
And this prediction has been tested in the following way. 

It's particularly been tested with hematopoietic stem cells.  And the question has 
been posed can these hematopoietic stem cells contribute to other lineages? 
Here's a mouse expressing green hematopoietic stem cells, or making green 
hematopoietic stem cells because of expression of the protein GFP under an 
appropriate tissue-specific promoter.  You can isolate bone marrow cells from the 
GFP expressing mouse. 

Transplant them into an irradiated mouse.  You get rescue, as we've discussed, 
but that's not the point of the experiment.  The point of the experiment, and this is 
the second to last slide on your handout.  The point of the experiment is to ask 
not about the bone marrow cells in the rescued mouse, but to ask whether any of 
the other tissues in the mouse contain these green cells that would have arisen 
from hematopoietic stem cells. 

OK.  So we're asking whether these hematopoietic stem cells can contribute to 
lineages other than the blood and the immune system.  And this has been an 
enormous focus of research.  And the answer initially appeared to be yes.  And 
this was a cause of tremendous excitement.  Here's one piece of data.  This is a 
picture of some cells from a mouse that was rescued with green hematopoietic 
stem cells. 

And this is a picture of the muscle from the mice.  The blue are nuclei and the 
green is the GFP that would have come from these transplanted hematopoietic 
stem cells.  And you can see green cells also in the nervous system, nerve cells 
that appear to come from these hematopoietic stem cells.  Well, it turns out alas 
that this is an artifact of the experiment.  And, in fact, what happens is that these 
green hematopoietic stem cells rescue the mouse in the correct way. 

But then they also fuse together with other cells.  They fuse with muscle cells and 
with nerve cells.  The two cells actually join together.  Their cell membranes 
mingle and you get a kind of hybrid cell that is a mixture of the hematopoietic cell 
and the regular muscle cell.  And this whole notion of the adult hematopoietic 
stem cell contributing to muscle, to nerve, to various other lineages has 
completely fallen to disfavor in most fields, in most people's opinion. 

Although, there is still data, there is still much experimentation to do to really 
address this, both in the hematopoietic stem cell and other lineages.  But no data 
currently supports that adult stem cells can interconvert one to another.  And that 
leads us to the difficult position of asking, so where is this universal repair kit 
going to come from? 

And this is where we move into the field of, I'm going to just leave that now, of 
embryonic stem cells.  So you know now that embryos have got many cells that 
are multipotent, pluripotent.  And indeed the zygote, as we discussed, is 
totipotent.  These cells can give rise to many, many different tissues because 
during embryogenesis that's the deal.  That's what has to happen. 

And so it came to the attention of people long ago that embryonic stem cells 
might be a great source of stem cells that can be used as this universal repair kit. 
Now, I want to tell you, I'm not going to go through this, you can go and look on 
the PowerPoint, you can go and look on the PDF file on your website.  I'm going 
to tell you about a type of cell, in the last few minutes, called the embryonic stem 
cell. 

And what you really need to know about this is it's almost totipotent.  And the first 
slides, I'm not going to go through, show you that this embryonic stem cell type is 
almost totipotent.  Now, what about these embryonic stem cells?  They come 
from, in taking a very early embryo, at a stage called the inner cell mass stage --

-- when there is a little mass of cells in the developing embryo, that's going to 
give rise to the whole embryo.  And taking this cell, removing these inner cell 
mass cells and putting them into a Petri dish with various culture media, what 
happens is that the cells from this early embryo divide and they make various 
clumps. 

And the clumps are descended from one particular cell.  And each of these 
clumps of cells is called an embryonic stem cell line.  Now, what's a cell line?  A 
cell line is a population of cells that can grow continuously in culture.  In other 
words, it self-renews.  What's a stem cell line?  A cell line, this is on your PDF file 
so you might want to sit and listen to this and then go and get this afterwards. 
OK?  What is a stem cell line? 

A stem cell line is a cell line that has the potential to go on and differentiate into 
various different lineages.  OK?  And so from this embryo that has been put in a 
Petri dish and the cells allowed to grow you get out a number of stem cell lines. 
And the notion is that each of these stem cell lines, if treated with the correct 
factor that's called here a differentiation factor, can go on to give rise to different 
tissues. 

Heart muscle, pancreas, cartilage and so on.  And the notion is that different ES 
cell lines will have different potencies.  So some will be really good at making 
hearts, some will be really good at making muscle and so on.  And it's not quite 
clear how one gets these different ES cell lines, but they exist from the mouse. 
And some of them exist from the human. 

And this is where we get into the other major issue of stem cell biology and the 
reason that there is so much legislature.  Because in order to get these human 

stem cell lines you have to use a human embryo.  To get human embryos you 
use methods of assisted reproductive technology.  I sent you some notes on this 
and you can read this in the book.  And the notion is that you remove eggs from 
a female, you make embryos in vitro, in a test-tube. 

And then when the embryos are balls of cells you harvest them, you kill them and 
you turn them into ES line.  And the thing that is sticking people right now in the 
legislature and is something that is really worth thinking about is whether ethically 
it is OK, guys, it's a 11:54, so stay.  Stay.  OK. 

And the thing that is killing people, is really sticking people ethically is whether it's 
OK to take these human embryos and turn them into cell lines, because this does 
involve killing an embryo and this is an ethical issue.  And I'm going to leave this 
here, and we'll come back to these ethical issues when we talk about cloning.
