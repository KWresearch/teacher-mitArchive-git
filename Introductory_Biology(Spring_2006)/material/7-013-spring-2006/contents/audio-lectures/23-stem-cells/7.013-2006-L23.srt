1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
Differentiation.
For someone who didn't see the

2
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
board.  Yeah?

3
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
Yeah.  So what a cell will become
eventually.  And differentiation is

4
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
the process by which
it becomes that.

5
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
OK.  Good.  So these terms are
essential for you to know for

6
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
today's lecture.
And if they are a little murky for

7
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
you then you should really make sure
they become clear.

8
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
OK.  I'm going to talk to you today
about stem cells.

9
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
This is the how-to module,
our second how-to module.  We have

10
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
two lectures, stem cells
and cloning.

11
00:00:54 --> 00:00:59
And what I want to do today is to go
beyond the media,

12
00:00:59 --> 00:01:04
beyond the hype and tell you about
stem cells, what we really know and

13
00:01:04 --> 00:01:09
why there is such a fuss about them.
And to put it in perspective of

14
00:01:09 --> 00:01:14
where you are in the course,
in our game board of life we're

15
00:01:14 --> 00:01:19
moving right along past foundations
up through formation and now into

16
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
our second how-to module.
So let's start with a question.

17
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
And you have a handout.  If you do
not have a handout, Shamsah,

18
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
could you be mail person?
And on the other side it looks like

19
00:01:34 --> 00:01:39
we need another mail person.
You will realize that I typically

20
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
do give you a handout of the most
important slides so that you don't

21
00:01:43 --> 00:01:48
have to grapple with things and that
you don't, in fact,

22
00:01:48 --> 00:01:53
have to print out the PowerPoint
handout before you come.

23
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
So you should always just check.
OK.  So what is a stem cell?

24
00:01:58 --> 00:02:04
Well, a stem cell is something that
has two important capacities.

25
00:02:04 --> 00:02:10
Firstly, it can self-renew.  That's
a very popular term.

26
00:02:10 --> 00:02:17
It can make more of itself.
And, secondly, it can give rise to

27
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
a number of different,
one or more different cell fates.

28
00:02:23 --> 00:02:39
So it can give rise --

29
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
-- to one or more differentiated
cell types.  Schematically,

30
00:02:44 --> 00:02:49
I've represented it for you in this
way.  So here is something that's

31
00:02:49 --> 00:02:54
called an uncommitted stem cell.
And you should be familiar with the

32
00:02:54 --> 00:02:59
term uncommitted, naive
and so on.

33
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
And this uncommitted stem cell can
undergo cell division to make more

34
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
of itself.  And it can also go on to
become something that's termed in

35
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
the field a "progenitor cell".
It's just a term.  It means a cell

36
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
that is going to give rise to
something else.

37
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
And I've depicted it here as a
determine progenitor.

38
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
It knows what it's going to become.
And this term uncommitted stem cell,

39
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
the uncommitted part is a little
misleading.  I'll talk about that

40
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
more in a moment.
This determined progenitor then goes

41
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
on to give rise to a whole bunch of
one or more, actually,

42
00:03:35 --> 00:03:40
differentiated cell types.
And the number of cell types that a

43
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
stem cell can go on to give rise to
is a measurement of its potency.

44
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
That is the definition of the term
potency.  So this is the notion of

45
00:03:48 --> 00:03:53
the stem cell concept.
You have this.  It's the first

46
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
figure on your handout.
And you'll find this in many

47
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
newspaper articles and books.
So what's so special about this and

48
00:04:02 --> 00:04:08
why are there newspaper articles and
newspaper articles and newspaper

49
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
articles and television programs and
covers of Time Magazine about stem

50
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
cells?  What's the hype?
Well, the deal is that it is

51
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
believed by some that stem cells are
going to be some kind of

52
00:04:26 --> 00:04:31
universal repair kit.
That somehow because stem cells can

53
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
give rise often to differentiated
cell types and make more of

54
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
themselves that they are in a
position to repair parts of the body

55
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
when the body needs repair.
You have a heart attack, you throw

56
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
in some stem cells,
repair the heart, you have a brain

57
00:04:48 --> 00:04:53
lesion, you throw in some stem cells
and you repair the damage.

58
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
And if you go through the
newspapers, as I did very,

59
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
very briefly, it's very easy to find
many, many different headlines.

60
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
One of the big ones last week,
I'll talk about this at the end,

61
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09
is that the Massachusetts House
passed a law expanding the use of

62
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
stem cells in research.
Hopkins is beginning human trials

63
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
with donor adult stem cells to
repair muscle damage from heart

64
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
attack.  This is an enormous amount
of interest in these cells because

65
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
of this notion of universal repair
kit-ness.  There are also

66
00:05:25 --> 00:05:29
advertisements.
The Stem Cell Bank and the Cord

67
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
Blood Registry would love you to pay
them to save your child's umbilical

68
00:05:33 --> 00:05:38
cord stem cells,
or the blood cells from a newborn's

69
00:05:38 --> 00:05:43
umbilical cord in the possibility
that you'll use these later on to

70
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
save the life of this child or
somebody else.

71
00:05:47 --> 00:05:52
And the other reason that stem
cells have got so much hype is that,

72
00:05:52 --> 00:05:57
as we'll discuss towards the end of
the lecture, they involve the use,

73
00:05:57 --> 00:06:02
or are likely to involve the use of
human embryos.

74
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
And that's a real fire point.
But let's step back and let's talk

75
00:06:07 --> 00:06:12
about stem cells and biologically
what are these things and what do

76
00:06:12 --> 00:06:18
you need them for?
And the thing we have to consider

77
00:06:18 --> 00:06:23
is the question of organ maintenance.
Now, I've told you several times,

78
00:06:23 --> 00:06:29
oh, you see, it popped up.  There
you go.  We have to give these frogs

79
00:06:29 --> 00:06:34
a moment to pop up.
OK.  That must have been somebody's

80
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
frog that popped up.
I've told you several times that

81
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
our bodies consist of about ten to
the twelfth cells.

82
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
That's a lot of cells.
But it's actually much worse than

83
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
that because it is not the same ten
to the twelfth cells that you

84
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
started with, once you got there,
that you keep throughout your life.

85
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
The cells in your body are
constantly dying and are constantly

86
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
being replenished.
And, in fact, if you look at your

87
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
ten to the twelfth cells,
over the course of your lifetime you

88
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
will make many times ten to the
twelfth cells.

89
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
You're not going to replace every
cell in your body because some of

90
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
them life forever,
but for many populations of cells in

91
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
your body you will replace those
organs completely.

92
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
OK?  So we're talking about making
lots and lots of cells.

93
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
And the issue really is one of
organ and tissue maintenance.

94
00:07:32 --> 00:07:39
And if one considers how organs and

95
00:07:39 --> 00:07:44
tissues are maintained,
they fall into three categories

96
00:07:44 --> 00:07:50
loosely.  Those that have a high
turnover rate where cells do not

97
00:07:50 --> 00:07:55
live for very long and need to be
replenished rather frequently to

98
00:07:55 --> 00:08:01
maintain the size and function
of the organ.

99
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
Those organs that have a low
turnover rate and those that are

100
00:08:05 --> 00:08:10
said to be static.
Organs with a high turnover rate

101
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
include, as I'll tell you a moment,
the blood, some of your hair.

102
00:08:14 --> 00:08:19
Organs with a low turnover rate
include things like your liver and

103
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
pancreases.  And organs that were
thought to be static,

104
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
but in fact that may not be true,
was the nervous system.  And now we

105
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
know that that's not true.
So let's talk about how we get to

106
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40
these terms.  High turnover.
Low turnover.  Let me just write it

107
00:08:40 --> 00:08:47
out.  Turnover.
And static natures of organ

108
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
maintenance.  And the way we do this,
or the way this has been done is by

109
00:08:53 --> 00:09:00
an assay that's called
a pulse-chase assay.

110
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
And a pulse-chase assay,
and this is the second slide on your

111
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
handout, goes like this.
In a cell population one can add a

112
00:09:10 --> 00:09:15
nucleotide analog bromodeoxyuridine.
It's uridine but it's incorporated

113
00:09:15 --> 00:09:21
into DNA because it's got that deoxy
there.  And bromodeoxyuridine is a

114
00:09:21 --> 00:09:26
nucleotide that is incorporated and
can then be detected using

115
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
various stains.
So you can tell which cells have

116
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
incorporated BrdU by staining them
appropriately.

117
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
So you can tell which cells are
dividing, which cells have gone

118
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
through S phase by whether they are
labeled or not.

119
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
And if you give a cell population a
short pulse, if you give BrdU for

120
00:09:45 --> 00:09:49
just a short time,
this is called a pulse,

121
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
it gets incorporated into the DNA,
and then the BrdU is gone.  And so

122
00:09:52 --> 00:09:56
you label your cell population.
And then you follow the cells over

123
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
a long time without
any added label.

124
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
And so the only cells you look at
are the ones that were labeled

125
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
during this pulse period.
And if you do that, you see that

126
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
your initially labeled cell
population lives for a while,

127
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
and then the cells start to
disappear because they die.

128
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
And you can monitor the half-life a
population by counting how long

129
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
cells live for.
OK?  So this is a pulse-chase

130
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
analysis.  And this will give you
the cell turnover time of

131
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
a particular organ.
And this is very useful in trying to

132
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
figure out whether cells have a high
turnover rate or a low turnover rate.

133
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
Now, you can do something else with
this.  You can look at your labeled

134
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
cell population,
and you can actually look not just

135
00:10:43 --> 00:10:48
at the numbers of cells but you can
look at what those cells become.

136
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
And sometimes your initially
labeled cell population will be the

137
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
final form, the differentiated state
of the cells, but sometimes it won't.

138
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
And then it's very informative to
follow that labeled cell population

139
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
and see what they do.
This is your third handout,

140
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
your third slide on your handout.
And if you follow them you might see

141
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
that this labeled cell population,
during the chase, differentiates

142
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
into something.
And that's very interesting.

143
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
And then later on those cells will
die and you'll be able to measure a

144
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
half-life as previously,
but this is very interesting because

145
00:11:23 --> 00:11:27
it tells you that this labeled cell
population was not the same as the

146
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
final fate of the cells.
And it implies that there is some

147
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
kind of precursor cell,
some kind of progenitor in your

148
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
labeled cell population that's
giving rise to the differentiated

149
00:11:39 --> 00:11:43
cells.  And it implies that these
initially labeled cells either are

150
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
stem cells or are progenitors
derived from stem cells that are

151
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
responsible for repopulating a
tissue as the tissue or organ needs

152
00:11:51 --> 00:11:56
to be maintained.
So these are two assays that are

153
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
very useful and are used to,
have been used to define high

154
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
turnover organs.
So what are some of these organs

155
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
that have, or tissues that
have high turnover?

156
00:12:08 --> 00:12:18
In fact, they've been used,

157
00:12:18 --> 00:12:23
these assays have been used to
define many tissues,

158
00:12:23 --> 00:12:28
those with high and those with low
turnover.  But it's the high

159
00:12:28 --> 00:12:33
turnover ones I want to talk about.
The red blood cells in your body

160
00:12:33 --> 00:12:38
have a turnover time,
half-time of about 120 days.

161
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
And if you do the calculation,
because you have a lot of red blood

162
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
cells, you're making more than a
billion cells a day.

163
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
OK?  As you are sitting here,
you are probably, during the course

164
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
of this lecture,
making several million new red blood

165
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
cells.  Your intestine,
some of the cells in your intestine

166
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
that are responsible for food
absorption turnover every

167
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
three to five days.
Your skin cells,

168
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
the epidermis of your skin turns
over with a half-life of about 14

169
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
days.  And your hair,
depending on where it comes from,

170
00:13:15 --> 00:13:20
turns over with a half-life of about
14 days to about four years.

171
00:13:20 --> 00:13:27
And the sense in many of these
organs, and I'll go through this a

172
00:13:27 --> 00:13:34
bit more in a moment,
is that this high turnover and the

173
00:13:34 --> 00:13:41
replenishment of these cells as they
disappear is driven by a stem cell

174
00:13:41 --> 00:13:48
population.  And I'm going to
abbreviate stem cells SC.

175
00:13:48 --> 00:13:55
And I'm going to put forth the
hypothesis that stem cells replenish

176
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
these organs.
Now, in some cases you can actually

177
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
look at the organ and you can do
your pulse-chase,

178
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
just like I told you,
and you can see that this must be so.

179
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
And an example that we've talked
about previously,

180
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
not in this context but previously
is the testes,

181
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
the spermatagonia are the cells
sitting right at the edge of the

182
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
seminiferous tubule,
which we'd label with BrdU.

183
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
And as you do your chase you would
see those cells as labeled cells

184
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
moving towards the lumen and
differentiating into the

185
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
stem cells.  OK?
And so you can actually see those

186
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
cells giving rise to the
differentiated cells.

187
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
Another tissue where this is very
beautiful is in the epidermis of the

188
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
skin.  So the epidermis of the skin
comprises multiple layers stacked up

189
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
on top of each other.
And as you get towards the outside

190
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
of the epidermis,
the cells in the outer layers are

191
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
dead and they form the layer that we
feel as skin.  But,

192
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
in fact, there are a lot of cells
that are living underneath

193
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
the outer layer.
In the very deepest layers of the

194
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
epidermis reside a dividing
population of cells that are,

195
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
that include the stem cells, and
I'll show you an assay for some of

196
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
this in a little bit.
These dividing cells,

197
00:15:14 --> 00:15:19
if you follow them, give rise to the
cells in the layers above.

198
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
So they either are the stem cells
or they are progenitor cells that

199
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
are replenishing the epidermis.
Now, in the blood, I told you that

200
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
you can do a pulse-chase assay.
And you can very accurately measure

201
00:15:31 --> 00:15:35
the half-life of red blood cells.
And it's clear that red blood cells

202
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
must come from some precursor.
In ourselves, in most vertebrates,

203
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
in many vertebrates red blood cells
do not have nuclei so they cannot

204
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
divide themselves.
And so there must be some kind of

205
00:15:46 --> 00:15:50
progenitor.  But the progenitors of
red blood cells and,

206
00:15:50 --> 00:15:53
in fact, many other cells in the
blood lie deep within the bone

207
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
marrow, the cavity of the bones.
And so you really cannot observe

208
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
them well to come to the conclusions
that I've just given you about the

209
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
testes and the epidermis
of the skin.

210
00:16:05 --> 00:16:10
So you have to do some kind of other
assay to figure out where these

211
00:16:10 --> 00:16:15
cells are coming from.
And over the years a huge body of

212
00:16:15 --> 00:16:20
data has given rise to this notion.
In the bone marrow of the long

213
00:16:20 --> 00:16:25
bones, and some of the shorter bones,
too, there is some kind of

214
00:16:25 --> 00:16:30
pluripotential or pluripotent
hematopoietic stem cell,

215
00:16:30 --> 00:16:35
that I've abbreviated HSC.
And this HSC gives rise,

216
00:16:35 --> 00:16:39
through a series of progenitors
which then go on to differentiate,

217
00:16:39 --> 00:16:44
into all of the cell types that are
found in the blood.

218
00:16:44 --> 00:16:49
The red blood cells.
The so-called white blood cells.

219
00:16:49 --> 00:16:54
The immune cells.  A huge spectrum
of differentiated cell types.

220
00:16:54 --> 00:16:58
And this hematopoietic stem cell has
been very, very useful in helping

221
00:16:58 --> 00:17:03
people who have got blood associated
illnesses in that it can,

222
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
after removal of diseased blood
cells, it can repopulate the tissue

223
00:17:07 --> 00:17:12
and help people get better.
And it's done so, and I'll go

224
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
through how this is done both in an
assay sense and point out that this

225
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
is exactly what's done in humans,
it's done so in a bone marrow

226
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
transplant.  So in assays,
let's just write down a couple of

227
00:17:25 --> 00:17:34
things here.

228
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
I've told you one assay already
for stem cells.

229
00:17:38 --> 00:17:49
OK?  So assays for stem cells ask

230
00:17:49 --> 00:17:55
how do you know if you've got a stem
cell?  Well, you can do that.

231
00:17:55 --> 00:18:01
You can ask this using the
pulse-chase by direct observation

232
00:18:01 --> 00:18:07
with your pulse-chase.
You can also do it by a repopulation

233
00:18:07 --> 00:18:13
assay.  And the notion in a
repopulation assay is that you try

234
00:18:13 --> 00:18:18
to restore a particular cell type by
putting in what you think is the

235
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
precursor of that cell type.
Now, in order to do these assays

236
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
you usually have to get rid of the
normal cells that were there so that

237
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
you can assay your repopulation.
OK?  Otherwise,

238
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
the normal cells can out-compete the
cells you're putting in.

239
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
OK?  But that's an aside.
So what is a bone marrow transplant?

240
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
The notion here is that one takes
an animal, and this is done in

241
00:18:46 --> 00:18:50
humans, and you irradiate the animal
so that you destroy all its bone

242
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
marrow.  This will eventually kill
the animal, OK,

243
00:18:54 --> 00:18:58
because you cannot live without a
hematopoietic stem cell and without

244
00:18:58 --> 00:19:02
all the cells that
derive from that.

245
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
And so, although this irradiated
animal would die,

246
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
you can rescue it by injecting
normal bone marrow.

247
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
You inject it into a mouse in the
tail vein, into people it goes into

248
00:19:14 --> 00:19:19
a central line that goes into your
blood system.  And then those bone

249
00:19:19 --> 00:19:23
marrow cells, it's extraordinary,
know where to go.  They home to the

250
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
bone marrow and they repopulate it
and they make again the

251
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
hematopoietic stem cell and all the
lineages that come from that.

252
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
Or they are the hematopoietic stem
cell, they maintain themselves and

253
00:19:36 --> 00:19:40
they give rise to all the other
lineages.  One of the criteria that

254
00:19:40 --> 00:19:44
I told you about stem cells is that
they need to be self-renewing.

255
00:19:44 --> 00:19:49
You can ask whether or not these
stem cells are self-renewing in an

256
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
assay like this,
where you take a mouse that you've

257
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
rescued by bone marrow transplant,
and you can ask whether it can serve

258
00:19:57 --> 00:20:01
as a source of marrow of
hematopoietic stem cells that will

259
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
rescue another irradiated mouse.
In other words,

260
00:20:05 --> 00:20:09
you could have rescued that first
mouse just by giving it a whole

261
00:20:09 --> 00:20:12
spectrum of almost differentiated
red blood cells,

262
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
white blood cells,
immune cells and so on.

263
00:20:16 --> 00:20:19
OK?  In order to test whether you
actually rescued it by giving it a

264
00:20:19 --> 00:20:23
stem cell, you can ask whether or
not you can take this rescued mouse

265
00:20:23 --> 00:20:27
and use it to rescue another mouse.
And, in fact, you can.

266
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
And this is consistent with,
not unequivocal, but it's consistent

267
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
with a sense that you have generated
more stem cells in the rescued mouse

268
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
that can go on to rescue another
mouse.  Another set of experiments

269
00:20:43 --> 00:20:48
that has been really pivotal in
understanding stem cells is to try

270
00:20:48 --> 00:20:53
to purify the stem cells and to
assay what are these pure stem cells.

271
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
And part of this is asking how many
cells do you need to rescue in a

272
00:20:59 --> 00:21:06
repopulation assay?

273
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
OK.  And so let me
make a note here.

274
00:21:10 --> 00:21:19
That when it comes to stem cell

275
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
isolation the overriding conclusion
from many assays done by many labs

276
00:21:25 --> 00:21:32
is that stem cells are rare and they
are hard to find.

277
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
In this experiment,
which is number five on your handout,

278
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
you can assay for how many stem
cells you need to rescue a mouse by

279
00:21:40 --> 00:21:44
removing bone marrow from one mouse
and staining that bone marrow,

280
00:21:44 --> 00:21:49
if you can, for a stem cell marker.
Now, what is a stem cell marker?

281
00:21:49 --> 00:21:53
OK?  If I have a stem cell marker I
would be able to go and pull out the

282
00:21:53 --> 00:21:57
stem cells.  Well,
there are no markers.

283
00:21:57 --> 00:22:01
A marker could be a protein or an
RNA that is expressed in a

284
00:22:01 --> 00:22:06
particular group of cells that you
suspect are the stem cells.

285
00:22:06 --> 00:22:10
OK?  This is very much an
experimental-driven field.

286
00:22:10 --> 00:22:14
There are markers that always
appear, proteins that are always

287
00:22:14 --> 00:22:18
there, antigens on the surface
stained with antibodies that are

288
00:22:18 --> 00:22:22
always there where you have a
population of cells that is able to

289
00:22:22 --> 00:22:26
rescue a mouse.
And so you can use these to

290
00:22:26 --> 00:22:30
hypothesize that this stem cell
marker is, in fact, marking

291
00:22:30 --> 00:22:35
the stem cells.
And you can go and purify cells that

292
00:22:35 --> 00:22:39
are expressing a particular marker.
And the way you do this is by using

293
00:22:39 --> 00:22:43
a really fantastic machine called
the Fluorescence Activated Cell

294
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
Sorter (FACS).
I'll go through it very briefly in

295
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
a moment.  But what it is able to do
is to purify cells that have got

296
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
particular fluorescences.
And they have these particular

297
00:22:55 --> 00:22:59
fluorescence spectra because of the
way you have stained them for

298
00:22:59 --> 00:23:03
particular stem cell markers.
And what you get out of your FACS

299
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
machine is a population that is much
more enriched for what I've called

300
00:23:07 --> 00:23:11
stem cells, but they're actually
cells that are expressing this

301
00:23:11 --> 00:23:15
punitive stem cell marker.
And then you can take these cells

302
00:23:15 --> 00:23:19
and say, well,
have I really enriched for the stem

303
00:23:19 --> 00:23:23
cell, by asking how many cells you
need to introduce into an irradiated

304
00:23:23 --> 00:23:27
mouse to rescue that mouse.
And you can do a dilution assay

305
00:23:27 --> 00:23:31
where you put in one cell,
ten cells, a hundred cells.

306
00:23:31 --> 00:23:35
Obviously, when you're down in the
one cell range,

307
00:23:35 --> 00:23:39
you do your dilution assay,
you get into a Poisson distribution,

308
00:23:39 --> 00:23:43
and you may not have exactly one
cell.  But you can do this

309
00:23:43 --> 00:23:47
statistically and you can figure out
how many cells from your population

310
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
it takes to rescue a mouse.
OK?  And the data to date tells us

311
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
that one cell of the correctly
purified population is sufficient to

312
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
rescue an irradiated mouse.
You have to do some tricks.

313
00:23:59 --> 00:24:02
You have to add some extra cells to
this one cell.

314
00:24:02 --> 00:24:06
You cannot just put one cell into
the mouse and rescue.

315
00:24:06 --> 00:24:09
You have to mix this one cell with
some other cells that help it do its

316
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
work.  OK?  But this is really an
extraordinary assay that tells us

317
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
we're very close to purifying a
hematopoietic stem cell.

318
00:24:17 --> 00:24:20
What is a FACS machine?  Very
briefly.  You can look at this later.

319
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
Cells that are labeled with
fluorescent antibodies are broken up

320
00:24:24 --> 00:24:28
into a stream of tiny droplets each
of which will contain one cell.

321
00:24:28 --> 00:24:32
And the cells then pass in a stream
through a laser which activates the

322
00:24:32 --> 00:24:37
fluorescence.  There's a
fluorescence detector that you can

323
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
program to respond to a particular
wavelength.  And what happens is

324
00:24:41 --> 00:24:46
that when the detector finds that it
has responded to a cell passing

325
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
through it because of the
fluorescence emitted,

326
00:24:50 --> 00:24:55
a charge is given to that cell,
and that cell with a particular

327
00:24:55 --> 00:25:00
fluorescence moves down the stream
through some deflecting plates where

328
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
it will be deflected,
according to its charge,

329
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
into a collecting bin.
And that way you can really get some

330
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
very highly purified cell
populations.  You can purify about

331
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
300,000 cells an hour using the FACS
machine.  And we have a lot of them

332
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
here at MIT and use them.
Many laboratories use them for

333
00:25:19 --> 00:25:22
various things.
A really cool machine.

334
00:25:22 --> 00:25:26
OK.  But we need to move on.
So we talked about some assays for

335
00:25:26 --> 00:25:30
stem cells.
Talked about the potency of

336
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
hematopoietic stem cells.
I want to tell you something now

337
00:25:34 --> 00:25:39
about the control of stem cells and
how a stem cell decides what to do.

338
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
So if you think about organ
maintenance, there is an implicit

339
00:25:43 --> 00:25:48
understanding that the organ knows
how much it needs to be maintained.

340
00:25:48 --> 00:25:53
It needs to know how many cells are
being lost, it needs to know when to

341
00:25:53 --> 00:25:57
make more cells,
and it also needs to know if there

342
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
has been some catastrophe.
If there's been a liver,

343
00:26:02 --> 00:26:07
some kind of a resection of the
liver, or if there has been skin

344
00:26:07 --> 00:26:12
wounding, OK, the organ needs to be
able to respond.

345
00:26:12 --> 00:26:16
And the stem cells in an organ need
to be able to respond to this

346
00:26:16 --> 00:26:21
catastrophe.  And this is where this
term niche comes in.

347
00:26:21 --> 00:26:26
Niche is one of these fields in the
term, terms in the field.

348
00:26:26 --> 00:26:31
It's like the term progenitor.
And niche is nothing that you

349
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
haven't heard about before.
What it refers to are the cells,

350
00:26:37 --> 00:26:42
as written up there, that surround
the stem cell.

351
00:26:42 --> 00:26:48
And what I'm going to tell you is
that the niche cells,

352
00:26:48 --> 00:26:53
the surrounding cells control,
by induction, stem cell fate.  And

353
00:26:53 --> 00:26:59
I'm also going to point out that
there can be some input

354
00:26:59 --> 00:27:04
of the environment.
So this is a cartoon that I drew for

355
00:27:04 --> 00:27:08
you.  It's number six on your
handout.  It's six across on your

356
00:27:08 --> 00:27:13
handout.  And I have here some stem
cells that I've called quiescent.

357
00:27:13 --> 00:27:17
They are not dividing.  Or they may
be dividing just a little bit just

358
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
to maintain themselves but not to
give rise to any progenitors that

359
00:27:21 --> 00:27:26
will go on to differentiate.
And these quiescent cells are

360
00:27:26 --> 00:27:30
maintained in this quiescent state,
we believe, because they are

361
00:27:30 --> 00:27:35
surrounded by a group of cells that
is maintaining them quiescent.

362
00:27:35 --> 00:27:40
What happens then is that these
quiescent cells sometimes get a

363
00:27:40 --> 00:27:45
stimulus, some kind of environmental
input, be it wounding,

364
00:27:45 --> 00:27:50
be it some kind of hormonal input
from another part of the body that

365
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
influences the surrounding cells and
changes the surrounding cells such

366
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
that they now change their patterns
of gene expression and start

367
00:28:00 --> 00:28:05
secreting stuff,
most likely, that changes the

368
00:28:05 --> 00:28:11
activity of the stem cells that they
are surrounding.

369
00:28:11 --> 00:28:15
I've shown you arrows there
indicating induction from the stem

370
00:28:15 --> 00:28:19
cells, from the surrounding cells to
the stem cells.

371
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
And what this inductive process
does, just like in the early embryo

372
00:28:23 --> 00:28:27
is to activate the stem cells to
divide and to form progenitor cells

373
00:28:27 --> 00:28:31
which will go on to do their thing
and differentiate into

374
00:28:31 --> 00:28:35
various fates.
And also, of course,

375
00:28:35 --> 00:28:39
the stem cells are renewed.
So this notion of the surrounding

376
00:28:39 --> 00:28:43
cells telling the stem cells what to
do is kind of new in the stem cell

377
00:28:43 --> 00:28:48
field.  If one is a developmental
biologist, it's one of these,

378
00:28:48 --> 00:28:52
OK, kind of observations because we
know that cells signal to one

379
00:28:52 --> 00:28:56
another.  And it's not surprising
that stem cells are told what to do

380
00:28:56 --> 00:29:01
by the cell surrounding them.
But there has been not very much

381
00:29:01 --> 00:29:05
information on this.
And I want to give you one system

382
00:29:05 --> 00:29:09
where it's been very  beautifully
looked at and where the contribution

383
00:29:09 --> 00:29:13
of the surrounding cells has been
looked at.  And this system is the

384
00:29:13 --> 00:29:17
hair follicle.
So your hairs come from a sheath of

385
00:29:17 --> 00:29:21
cells that starts off in the
epidermis and moves deep down,

386
00:29:21 --> 00:29:25
extends deep down into the deeper
layers of the skin called

387
00:29:25 --> 00:29:30
the dermis.
And there is a shaft of cells of

388
00:29:30 --> 00:29:35
which these matrix cells down here
are important because these matrix

389
00:29:35 --> 00:29:40
cells divide and they give rise to
cells that will form the center of

390
00:29:40 --> 00:29:44
the shaft and secrete,
or not secrete but synthesis

391
00:29:44 --> 00:29:49
proteins called keratins.
The keratins are this stuff.

392
00:29:49 --> 00:29:54
And eventually the cell gets so
full of keratin that it dies.

393
00:29:54 --> 00:29:59
And at the same time more cells are
coming in the bottom here and this

394
00:29:59 --> 00:30:04
whole shaft, this whole hair shaft
is pushed out of the hair follicle.

395
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
OK?  And so that is why your hair
grows.  It has been pushed out from

396
00:30:08 --> 00:30:13
the bottom.  And all the stuff that
we are so fond of is dead cells.

397
00:30:13 --> 00:30:18
It's actually protein.  It's a very
interesting polymer of various

398
00:30:18 --> 00:30:22
keratins.  Now,
what's very interesting here is that

399
00:30:22 --> 00:30:27
over the years researchers have
shown that the hair,

400
00:30:27 --> 00:30:31
well, let me back track for a moment.
You know your hair falls out,

401
00:30:31 --> 00:30:34
right?  You brush your hair and your
hair falls out.

402
00:30:34 --> 00:30:38
OK?  Ergo, it must be replenished
somehow.  And over the years it has

403
00:30:38 --> 00:30:41
been shown that these bulge cells,
or cells in a little bulge, which

404
00:30:41 --> 00:30:44
was a rather insignificant little
bulge but it's there,

405
00:30:44 --> 00:30:48
sitting on the side of the hair
shaft is actually the source of the

406
00:30:48 --> 00:30:51
stem cells for the hair.
And another region, I'm going to

407
00:30:51 --> 00:30:54
tell you about in a moment,
is down here.  It's labeled DP.

408
00:30:54 --> 00:30:58
Bear it in mind as I tell you
something and then we'll

409
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
come back to it.
So let me first show you some data

410
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
that tells us that the bulge cells
are the cells that contain or that

411
00:31:06 --> 00:31:11
include the stem cells for making
hair.  One can do an experiment

412
00:31:11 --> 00:31:16
where one takes these bulge cells
and does essentially a repopulation

413
00:31:16 --> 00:31:20
assay, just as in the case of the
bone marrow transplant.

414
00:31:20 --> 00:31:25
And one can do this into a strain
of mice called nude.

415
00:31:25 --> 00:31:30
So nude mice have got multiple
issues.

416
00:31:30 --> 00:31:33
But one of their issues is that they
have no fur.  OK?

417
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
And one can take bulge cells from a
normal mouse and transplant them

418
00:31:37 --> 00:31:40
into a nude mouse.
Here's the control transplant,

419
00:31:40 --> 00:31:44
and you can see there's no fur.  And
here is a transplant of bulge cells

420
00:31:44 --> 00:31:47
from a normal mouse.
And here you see this tuft of fur

421
00:31:47 --> 00:31:51
growing out on the back of the nude
mouse.  And, in fact,

422
00:31:51 --> 00:31:54
some very cool assays have been done
where these transplanted cells are

423
00:31:54 --> 00:31:58
labeled green.
And you can look at these tufts of

424
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
fur and see them growing
fluorescently green.

425
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
So you know that the new fur came
from the transplanted cells.

426
00:32:06 --> 00:32:10
OK.  So what about niche?  Well,
you know that your hair falls out.

427
00:32:10 --> 00:32:15
But, actually, there's a lot more
to it than that.

428
00:32:15 --> 00:32:19
And it turns out there is a whole
hair cycle of when the hair grows

429
00:32:19 --> 00:32:24
and when it doesn't grow.
And it goes like this.  There's a

430
00:32:24 --> 00:32:28
time called anagen which is a period
of growth when these matrix cells

431
00:32:28 --> 00:32:32
down here are dividing and they are
pushing out this hair

432
00:32:32 --> 00:32:37
and it's growing.
After a while the cells down here

433
00:32:37 --> 00:32:41
stop dividing and the hair follicle
doesn't grow anymore,

434
00:32:41 --> 00:32:45
or the hair shaft doesn't grow
anymore.  This is called catagen.

435
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
And it's a time that's termed
regression.  It is when there is no

436
00:32:49 --> 00:32:53
more growth.  And if the hair is
going to fall out,

437
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57
it might fall out then,
or it might stick around and the

438
00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
next step might take place.
And this is a step called telogen

439
00:33:02 --> 00:33:06
which is a resting state.
And then after that there is a new

440
00:33:06 --> 00:33:10
state, a new anagen where the hair
will start growing again.

441
00:33:10 --> 00:33:14
And it may either be a new hair or
it may be the one that's there that

442
00:33:14 --> 00:33:19
just grows longer.
It depends on the part of the body.

443
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
OK.  Now, what I'm going to tell
you is that a region called the

444
00:33:23 --> 00:33:27
dermal papilla induces stem cell
activation at certain times during

445
00:33:27 --> 00:33:31
the hair cycle.
So look at this.

446
00:33:31 --> 00:33:35
At anagen, during growth,
the bulge and this dermal papilla,

447
00:33:35 --> 00:33:39
OK, this DP, it doesn't matter what
the name is but just look at the red,

448
00:33:39 --> 00:33:42
are far apart from each other.
At catagen they're still far apart,

449
00:33:42 --> 00:33:46
but look at what happens at telogen
in this resting stage.

450
00:33:46 --> 00:33:50
The dermal papilla and the bulge
are touching one another.

451
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
And this is the phase, although
it's called a resting phase,

452
00:33:53 --> 00:33:57
this is the phase when the hair
follicle is actually getting ready

453
00:33:57 --> 00:34:01
for the next big spurt of cell
division and differentiation that is

454
00:34:01 --> 00:34:05
going to make the hair longer or
make a new one grow.

455
00:34:05 --> 00:34:08
And then, subsequently,
the dermal papilla and the bulge

456
00:34:08 --> 00:34:11
stay close together,
but eventually they will start

457
00:34:11 --> 00:34:15
pulling apart again.
Well, it's been shown very

458
00:34:15 --> 00:34:18
elegantly that this dermal papilla
signals to these bulge cells when

459
00:34:18 --> 00:34:22
they're touching one another and
tells the bulge stem cells to

460
00:34:22 --> 00:34:25
activate and start making more hair
or a new hair follicle.

461
00:34:25 --> 00:34:29
And the signaling is done through a
pathway called the wnt

462
00:34:29 --> 00:34:33
signaling pathway.
And I point this out because it uses

463
00:34:33 --> 00:34:37
a protein that should be familiar to
you, which is our old friend

464
00:34:37 --> 00:34:41
beta-catenin that we talked about
way back when as being important for

465
00:34:41 --> 00:34:45
dorsal-ventral patenting in the
early embryo.  And I point it out to

466
00:34:45 --> 00:34:49
you to make the point that proteins
are used over and over again.

467
00:34:49 --> 00:34:53
Regulatory proteins can be used
over and over again in the body.

468
00:34:53 --> 00:34:57
OK.  So this is a very lovely
example of what happens

469
00:34:57 --> 00:35:02
in a stem cell niche.
So let's move on and let's ask how

470
00:35:02 --> 00:35:08
plastic adult stem cells are.
OK.  So here we have some issues.

471
00:35:08 --> 00:35:13
Well, the goal of the medical
community is to get a stem cell that

472
00:35:13 --> 00:35:19
can repair every tissue.
And it may be that every adult

473
00:35:19 --> 00:35:24
tissue has a stem cell population in
it, but these can be difficult to

474
00:35:24 --> 00:35:30
isolate.  It's very difficult to
isolate these hair stem cells.

475
00:35:30 --> 00:35:35
You can get enough to get tufts of
hair on another mouse,

476
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
but it's hard to get enough of them
to repair someone's bald head for

477
00:35:41 --> 00:35:47
example.  OK?  So the Holy Grail of
stem cell-ness is to try to find a

478
00:35:47 --> 00:35:53
cell that is a multi-potent adult
progenitor.  OK?

479
00:35:53 --> 00:35:59
And this has been the real goal of
the adult stem cell field.

480
00:35:59 --> 00:36:07
And the question that has been posed
is, is there a multi-potent,

481
00:36:07 --> 00:36:15
a highly plastic, multi-potent also
termed plastic,

482
00:36:15 --> 00:36:23
adult stem cell?
And if there was then in theory one

483
00:36:23 --> 00:36:29
could use it to repair all organs.
So here again is our stem cell

484
00:36:29 --> 00:36:33
concept where some kind of stem cell
goes on to give rise to a set of

485
00:36:33 --> 00:36:37
differentiated cells.
Now, the set of differentiated

486
00:36:37 --> 00:36:41
cells forms what's called a lineage
where all the cell types that come

487
00:36:41 --> 00:36:45
out of a single stem cell are
related to one another because they

488
00:36:45 --> 00:36:49
come from a common heritage,
from a common progenitor, from a

489
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
common stem cell.
And you can, for different lineages,

490
00:36:53 --> 00:36:57
make different trees of stem cells
progenitors and differentiated

491
00:36:57 --> 00:37:02
progeny.
And it has been hypothesized that

492
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
there is some kind of
interconvertibility between

493
00:37:06 --> 00:37:11
different stem cells in the adult,
and that one stem cell for one

494
00:37:11 --> 00:37:15
lineage can be under the right
circumstances converted to a stem

495
00:37:15 --> 00:37:20
cell for a different lineage.
And that maybe there's even some

496
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
kind of master stem cell floating
around in the adult that can give

497
00:37:24 --> 00:37:29
rise to all other stem cells.
Maybe there is some totipotent or

498
00:37:29 --> 00:37:33
pluripotent very,
very highly potent adult stem cell

499
00:37:33 --> 00:37:38
that can give rise to all these
other stem cell lineages and can,

500
00:37:38 --> 00:37:43
therefore, be used as this universal
repair kit.  And this has been

501
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
assayed.  And the prediction from
this is that adult stem cells from

502
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
one lineage, for example the
hematopoietic lineage,

503
00:37:52 --> 00:37:57
can contribute to another lineage.
For example, the muscle cell

504
00:37:57 --> 00:38:02
lineage.  And this prediction has
been tested in the following way.

505
00:38:02 --> 00:38:06
It's particularly been tested with
hematopoietic stem cells.

506
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
And the question has been posed can
these hematopoietic stem cells

507
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
contribute to other lineages?
Here's a mouse expressing green

508
00:38:14 --> 00:38:19
hematopoietic stem cells,
or making green hematopoietic stem

509
00:38:19 --> 00:38:23
cells because of expression of the
protein GFP under an appropriate

510
00:38:23 --> 00:38:27
tissue-specific promoter.
You can isolate bone marrow cells

511
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
from the GFP expressing mouse.
Transplant them into an irradiated

512
00:38:32 --> 00:38:36
mouse.  You get rescue,
as we've discussed, but that's not

513
00:38:36 --> 00:38:40
the point of the experiment.
The point of the experiment,

514
00:38:40 --> 00:38:44
and this is the second to last slide
on your handout.

515
00:38:44 --> 00:38:49
The point of the experiment is to
ask not about the bone marrow cells

516
00:38:49 --> 00:38:53
in the rescued mouse,
but to ask whether any of the other

517
00:38:53 --> 00:38:57
tissues in the mouse contain these
green cells that would have arisen

518
00:38:57 --> 00:39:02
from hematopoietic stem cells.
OK.  So we're asking whether these

519
00:39:02 --> 00:39:06
hematopoietic stem cells can
contribute to lineages other than

520
00:39:06 --> 00:39:10
the blood and the immune system.
And this has been an enormous focus

521
00:39:10 --> 00:39:15
of research.  And the answer
initially appeared to be yes.

522
00:39:15 --> 00:39:19
And this was a cause of tremendous
excitement.  Here's one piece of

523
00:39:19 --> 00:39:23
data.  This is a picture of some
cells from a mouse that was rescued

524
00:39:23 --> 00:39:28
with green hematopoietic
stem cells.

525
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
And this is a picture of the muscle
from the mice.

526
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
The blue are nuclei and the green
is the GFP that would have come from

527
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40
these transplanted hematopoietic
stem cells.  And you can see green

528
00:39:40 --> 00:39:45
cells also in the nervous system,
nerve cells that appear to come from

529
00:39:45 --> 00:39:49
these hematopoietic stem cells.
Well, it turns out alas that this

530
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
is an artifact of the experiment.
And, in fact, what happens is that

531
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
these green hematopoietic stem cells
rescue the mouse in

532
00:39:57 --> 00:40:02
the correct way.
But then they also fuse together

533
00:40:02 --> 00:40:06
with other cells.
They fuse with muscle cells and

534
00:40:06 --> 00:40:11
with nerve cells.
The two cells actually join

535
00:40:11 --> 00:40:16
together.  Their cell membranes
mingle and you get a kind of hybrid

536
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
cell that is a mixture of the
hematopoietic cell and the regular

537
00:40:20 --> 00:40:25
muscle cell.  And this whole notion
of the adult hematopoietic stem cell

538
00:40:25 --> 00:40:30
contributing to muscle,
to nerve, to various other lineages

539
00:40:30 --> 00:40:34
has completely fallen to disfavor in
most fields, in most

540
00:40:34 --> 00:40:38
people's opinion.
Although, there is still data,

541
00:40:38 --> 00:40:42
there is still much experimentation
to do to really address this,

542
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
both in the hematopoietic stem cell
and other lineages.

543
00:40:46 --> 00:40:49
But no data currently supports that
adult stem cells can interconvert

544
00:40:49 --> 00:40:53
one to another.
And that leads us to the difficult

545
00:40:53 --> 00:40:57
position of asking,
so where is this universal repair

546
00:40:57 --> 00:41:01
kit going to come from?
And this is where we move into the

547
00:41:01 --> 00:41:06
field of, I'm going to just leave
that now, of embryonic stem cells.

548
00:41:06 --> 00:41:12
So you know now that embryos have
got many cells that are multipotent,

549
00:41:12 --> 00:41:17
pluripotent.  And indeed the zygote,
as we discussed,

550
00:41:17 --> 00:41:22
is totipotent.  These cells can give
rise to many, many different tissues

551
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
because during embryogenesis that's
the deal.  That's what

552
00:41:28 --> 00:41:33
has to happen.
And so it came to the attention of

553
00:41:33 --> 00:41:37
people long ago that embryonic stem
cells might be a great source of

554
00:41:37 --> 00:41:41
stem cells that can be used as this
universal repair kit.

555
00:41:41 --> 00:41:45
Now, I want to tell you,
I'm not going to go through this,

556
00:41:45 --> 00:41:49
you can go and look on the
PowerPoint, you can go and look on

557
00:41:49 --> 00:41:53
the PDF file on your website.
I'm going to tell you about a type

558
00:41:53 --> 00:41:58
of cell, in the last few minutes,
called the embryonic stem cell.

559
00:41:58 --> 00:42:07
And what you really need to know

560
00:42:07 --> 00:42:11
about this is it's almost totipotent.
And the first slides,

561
00:42:11 --> 00:42:16
I'm not going to go through,
show you that this embryonic stem

562
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
cell type is almost totipotent.
Now, what about these embryonic

563
00:42:20 --> 00:42:25
stem cells?  They come from,
in taking a very early embryo,

564
00:42:25 --> 00:42:30
at a stage called the inner cell
mass stage --

565
00:42:30 --> 00:42:35
-- when there is a little mass of
cells in the developing embryo,

566
00:42:35 --> 00:42:40
that's going to give rise to the
whole embryo.  And taking this cell,

567
00:42:40 --> 00:42:46
removing these inner cell mass cells
and putting them into a Petri dish

568
00:42:46 --> 00:42:51
with various culture media,
what happens is that the cells from

569
00:42:51 --> 00:42:57
this early embryo divide and they
make various clumps.

570
00:42:57 --> 00:42:57
And the clumps are descended from
one particular cell.

571
00:42:57 --> 00:42:57
And each of these clumps of cells
is called an embryonic stem cell

572
00:42:57 --> 00:42:58
line.  Now, what's a cell line?
A cell line is a population of

573
00:42:58 --> 00:42:58
cells that can grow continuously in
culture.  In other words,

574
00:42:58 --> 00:42:59
it self-renews.  What's a stem cell
line?  A cell line,

575
00:42:59 --> 00:42:59
this is on your PDF file so you
might want to sit and listen to this

576
00:42:59 --> 00:43:00
and then go and get this afterwards.
OK?  What is a stem cell line?

577
00:43:00 --> 00:43:09
A stem cell line is a cell line that
has the potential to go on and

578
00:43:09 --> 00:43:18
differentiate into various different
lineages.  OK?

579
00:43:18 --> 00:43:27
And so from this embryo that has
been put in a Petri dish and the

580
00:43:27 --> 00:43:36
cells allowed to grow you get out a
number of stem cell lines.

581
00:43:36 --> 00:43:45
And the notion is that each of
these stem cell lines,

582
00:43:45 --> 00:43:54
if treated with the correct factor
that's called here a differentiation

583
00:43:54 --> 00:44:03
factor, can go on to give rise to
different tissues.

584
00:44:03 --> 00:44:07
Heart muscle, pancreas,
cartilage and so on.  And the notion

585
00:44:07 --> 00:44:11
is that different ES cell lines will
have different potencies.

586
00:44:11 --> 00:44:15
So some will be really good at
making hearts,

587
00:44:15 --> 00:44:19
some will be really good at making
muscle and so on.

588
00:44:19 --> 00:44:23
And it's not quite clear how one
gets these different ES cell lines,

589
00:44:23 --> 00:44:28
but they exist from the mouse.  And
some of them exist from the human.

590
00:44:28 --> 00:44:32
And this is where we get into the
other major issue of stem cell

591
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
biology and the reason that there is
so much legislature.

592
00:44:36 --> 00:44:40
Because in order to get these human
stem cell lines you have to use a

593
00:44:40 --> 00:44:45
human embryo.  To get human embryos
you use methods of assisted

594
00:44:45 --> 00:44:49
reproductive technology.
I sent you some notes on this and

595
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
you can read this in the book.
And the notion is that you remove

596
00:44:53 --> 00:44:57
eggs from a female,
you make embryos in vitro,

597
00:44:57 --> 00:45:03
in a test-tube.
And then when the embryos are balls

598
00:45:03 --> 00:45:09
of cells you harvest them,
you kill them and you turn them into

599
00:45:09 --> 00:45:15
ES line.  And the thing that is
sticking people right now in the

600
00:45:15 --> 00:45:21
legislature and is something that is
really worth thinking about is

601
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
whether ethically it is OK,
guys, it's a 11:54, so stay.

602
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
Stay.  OK.
And the thing that is killing people,

603
00:45:32 --> 00:45:36
is really sticking people ethically
is whether it's OK to take these

604
00:45:36 --> 00:45:41
human embryos and turn them into
cell lines, because this does

605
00:45:41 --> 00:45:45
involve killing an embryo and this
is an ethical issue.

606
00:45:45 --> 00:45:50
And I'm going to leave this here,
and we'll come back to these ethical

607
00:45:50 --> 00:45:53
issues when we talk about cloning.
