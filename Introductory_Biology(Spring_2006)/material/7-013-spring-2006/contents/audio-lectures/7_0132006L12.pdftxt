Transcript – Lecture 12 

OK.  Parts of a gene.  We have our promoter, which is part of the 
untranscribed region of a gene, usually in the 5 prime end.  Not always 
but for the genes we’re talking about at the 5 prime end, the so-called 
5 prime end of the gene, or so-called upstream of this transcribed 
region. 

And downstream of that there is more untranscribed region that 
interestingly can also contribute to the promoter, even though it’s far 
away from this more upstream part of the promoter.  But I’m going to 
call it just for now untranscribed, two flanking regions of untranscribed 
DNA sequence and one region of transcribed sequence. 

Now, I want to discuss with you very briefly a phenomenon called 
splicing.  And this is a phenomenon that occurs within the RNA that is 
transcribed from a gene and, therefore, pertains to the transcribed 
region of the gene.  It turns out that in this transcribed region there 
are two kinds of sequences.  There are things called exons and there 
are regions called introns. 

The exons code for something, code for the final function of the RNA or 
for eventually a protein.  So these are coding.  The introns are 
noncoding.  Both of them are transcribed.  You’ll see this definition is a 
little loose as we move on in today’s lecture, but it’s good enough. 

In the transcript that initially is made from the gene in this transcribed 
region, both introns and exons are present.  So these are present in 
what’s called the primary transcript or primary RNA.  And primary 
refers to the first RNA that is transcribed from the gene. 

And subsequent to that, still in the nucleus, those introns and exons 
are subject to a process called splicing whereby the introns are 
removed --

-- or spliced out is the term, such that in your mature RNA only the 
exons are present. 

This process is likely a consequence.  I’m going to put up a diagram 
that you had on your last time’s handout.  You can watch it now.  And 
you can refer back to a previous lecture if you don’t have it with you. 

This notion of introns and exons is probably a consequence of 
evolution whereby different parts of genes were combined and shuffled 
to give new kinds of genes and, therefore, new kinds of proteins.  Here 
on my diagram I have exons in black and introns in blue, and they’re 
all just DNA sequence, but when the RNA is transcribed in the first 
place is primary RNA. 

It’s a copy of the gene.  It has both exons and introns.  And then a 
very complex enzymatic machinery comes on and it loops out and 
excises these introns.  OK?  So this is very interesting such that in 
your mature mRNA there are no introns.  And the introns have been 
looped out and they form these little structures that are called lariats. 
And at this point your mRNA is mature --

-- and it moves to the cytoplasm.  Now, this process what discovered 
by Professor Phillip Sharp here at MIT and he got the Nobel Prize for it 
in 1993.  It’s a very important process because it’s absolutely required 
for maturation of RNAs.  And also, and I’ll come to this in a few 
lecture’s time, it allows different proteins to be made from the same 
mRNA.  So here’s a rule. 

In this RNA there are what are called splice donor cites that I’ve put as 
a circle and splice acceptor sites that I’ve put as a square.  Just watch 
this.  Just watch this for now because we will come back to it.  So 
watch what I’m saying rather than trying to madly write down.  Any 
spliced donor can join to any splice acceptor and remove the stuff 
between them.  So in this top example I’ve got each introns being 
neatly removed because splice donors and inceptors interact. 

But look at the example below.  I’ve got this splice donor next to exon 
one interacting with a spliced acceptor next to exon three.  And when 
that happens you remove the hull of exon two.  So you actually are 
going to make a different protein.  Whereas, in the first case you’ll 
have exons one, two and three and four.  In the second case you’ll 
have exons one, three and four. 

OK?  So this process is very important for allowing different kinds of 
proteins to be made from the same gene.  I want to make you aware 
of this now, and I will come back to it in the formation module when 

we talk about how different kinds of cells are generated.  All right.  So 
let’s move onto the major topic of today’s lecture --

-- which takes us back to the central dogma.  And I want to introduce 
to you a term that is very important that you know and you 
understand.  And this is the term gene expression.  And really what 
we’ve been talking about is gene expression. 

Gene expression simply refers to the generation of the final product of 
a gene from the gene.  So we’re talking about the formation of a 
protein as directed by a particular gene.  OK?  So gene expression is, if 
you like, the readout.  Here’s another way of putting it.  The readout, 
the final readout of a gene, or the generation of the final product of a 
gene. 

I’m going to come back to this term over and over again, and I will ask 
you to define it in your own way, but it’s a term I want to throw out at 
you now because you do need to know it.  It’s very pervasive.  Today I 
want to talk about the step in gene expression or translation whereby 
RNA is converted or is used to direct synthesis of a protein. 

So let’s define translation because it is, I think, one of the most 
interesting questions in molecular biology.  Certainly from a historical 
perspective that was true.  And the notion in translation is that the 
base sequence of a mRNA somehow leads to the synthesis of a protein 
with a defined amino acid sequence. 

Now, if you think about DNA replication, transcription and translation, 
the relationship between them, there is a nice analogy that one can 
make.  DNA uses the base code, four bases.  Transcription RNA uses 
those same four bases as a code, but it’s slightly different from DNA. 
So the synthesis of RNA using a DNA template is kind of like changing 
fonts in a document that you have.  It’s kind of like going from Times 
New Roman to Helvetica. 

You haven’t really changed much.  It just looks a bit different. 
Translation is very different.  The use of mRNA to direct the synthesis 
of a protein is much more analogous to changing language where 
you’ve taken English and translated it into Chinese or Russian and 
translated it into French.  OK?  So this is a really different process. 
And it was clear from the outset, historically, that one had to think in a 
slightly different way about how this process was directed. 

And I want to talk about four things with respect to translation. 
Firstly, I want to talk about the genetic code that allows RNA to direct 
protein synthesis.  I want to talk about something called the 
interpreter of that code. 

I’m going to talk about the factory in which the synthesis takes place. 
And then I’m going to get to a discussion of the molecule bases for 
genotype and phenotype. 

So let’s think about the code.  And thinking about this starts from a 
very simple logical place.  And the place is this.  One starts with four 
bases, A, G, C and T or A, G, C and U, depending if you’re talking 
about DNA and RNA.  And somehow those four bases have to be used 
in some kind of code to give you an outcome of 20 amino acids. 

And I am going to use the abbreviation AA for amino acids.  So you 
can look at this and immediately understand there has to be some 
kind of combinatorial code in order to specify those 20 amino acids. 
So you can do combinations and you can say, OK, if two bases were 
used and you could have combinations of doublets, how many 
combinations can you get to and would that be enough to specify 
those 20 amino acids? 

Well, no, because two base combinations would only give you 16 
possible amino acid combinations, or the ability to specify 16 amino 
acids.  OK?  Four squared.  How about three base combinations?  Well, 
that’s better. 

What you can get out of that is 64 different combinations.  OK?  And 
that is plenty to specify your 20 amino acids with some left over.  And, 
in fact, this is what is used.  Combinations of three bases.  And these 
combinations of three bases are termed the triplet code. 

The discovery of the triplet code is really fascinating.  I don’t have 
time to go into it in this lecture, but your book is not too bad on the 
discovery.  And I will post on your website, for those of you who really 
want to get into it, a reference to a very interesting historical account 
of the discovery of the triplet code and indeed of much of molecular 
biology.  But it’s a fascinating story.  But I’m going to tell you the code 
is a triplet code.  OK. 

So what does that mean?  It means that three bases correspond to a 
particular amino acid.  OK?  So one triplet of bases correspond, I’m 

writing this out because it’s really important that you know this, 
correspond to one amino acid. 

And this base triplet gets a special name.  It’s called a codon. 

And the thing that you will have noticed is that what I’ve told you is 
there are 64 possible combinations of triplets and only 20 amino acids. 
And so that leaves some over.  What happens?  Well, they’re all used. 

And what happens is that although the code is universal, as far as we 
know it arose just once, all living organisms on our planet use this 
code, it is a redundant code.  So I will write down it is redundant but 
not ambiguous, and tell you what that means. 

So what that means is that an amino acid can be specified by more 
than one triplet, and I’ll show you that in a moment, but that any 
triplet of bases only corresponds to one amino acid.  Let’s look at some 
diagrams to show you what I mean.  This is a table of your amino acid 
code. 

These letters in columns represent the bases.  And next to them are 
written the amino acids that correspond to this particular code.  Let’s 
start with an easy one.  This is methionine encoded by AUG.  And 
that’s one you should actually remember.  OK?  And for methionine 
there is only one possible codon.  It is AUG and always AUG.  But let’s 
keep going here.  And let’s look at the amino acid lucine. 

lucine is encoded by six possible triplets, six possible codons, UAA, 
UAG, CUU, CUC, CUA and CUG.  Any one of those in a mRNA can 
encode lucine.  However, CUU only encodes lucine.  It never encodes 
another amino acid.  OK?  And that’s what I mean by redundant. 

More than one triplet can encode one amino acid, but any given triplet 
only corresponds to one particular amino acid.  OK.  You will have 
practice on this kind of thing as you go along.  So let’s get some basics 
down here.  The template in the whole translation process is your 
mRNA. 

OK?  It’s the code.  It contains the code.  It is read to give a protein 
readout from 5 prime to 3 prime.  And the readout of the protein, as I 
mentioned to you way back when, reads out from the amino to the 
carboxyl end.  New amino acids are added onto the carboxyl end --

-- and the free amino group corresponds to the first amino acid 
polymerized.  So it is read 5 prime to 3 prime, and that corresponds to 
the amino to the carboxy growth of the protein. 

All mRNAs start with the same amino acid, and that is methionine. 
And the start or initiation codon in all proteins is methionine, oops, is 
AUG which encodes methionine. 

Now, not all final proteins have got methionine at their amino ends 
because it can be cleaved off.  OK?  So you don’t have to land up with 
a protein that has a methionine end, its amino end, but it starts off 
with methionine there.  And then there are no gaps in the message.  It 
is read without any punctuation marks, except for the fact that the 
codons are next to one another in a non-overlapping way.  OK? 

So there are no gaps.  And the only punctuation is the start codon and 
a series of stop codons which do not encode any amino acids.  These 
are UAA, UAG and UGA.  And you can remember them if you want, but 
we’re not going to test that you do.  OK?  You can use your amino acid 
tables. 

OK.  So your punctuation is the start and the end of the message.  All 
right.  So let’s go on and talk about the interpreter and what I mean 
by the interpreter.  In this diagram here I have got, look up here for a 
moment.  This is quite a nice diagram not from your book.  I’ve got 
your DNA strand, which is your template strand. 

Your corresponding RNA, your mRNA, and the readout of the RNA to 
the protein.  And here are the codons, UGG, this is in the middle of the 
protein so that’s why there’s no methionine, UGG corresponding to 
tryptophan, UUU corresponding to phenylalanine.  You can see how 
the codons are right next to each other, OK, but do not overlap.  In 
fact, I’m going to write that on the board.  So no gaps and no codon 
overlap. 

Very important that you understand that.  So when people looked to 
this and figured out what the codons corresponded to in terms of 
amino acids there was the question of, well, how do you actually get 
those amino acids corresponding to those codons?  And there was a 
sense that you needed some kind of adapter or interpreter molecule 
that both recognized the codon and recognized the amino acid.  And 
that’s the next thing that I’m going to tell you.  And --

-- stop.  Well, I apologize on behalf of our illustrious institute for the 
boards in this room.  OK.  So all right.  So let’s talk about interpreter. 

And I’ll tell you that this is the class of RNA someone brought up 
earlier called tRNAs.  So tRNA, as you may recall, are these very small 
RNAs.  There are about 100 base pairs, 100 bases in length, and there 
are a lot of them.  And there is a tRNA that corresponds to every 
codon.  So tRNAs recognize both the amino acid and the specific 
codon. 

And they recognize, let’s talk about the codon first.  They recognize 
the codon by DNA complement, by RNA complementarity, by base 
pairing to a region on the tRNA called the anti-codon. 

So let’s talk about methionine for a moment.  The codon for 
methionine is AUG.  That’s the codon.  Woops.  Hold on one second 
here.  5 prime AUG, that’s your codon. 

And what will be complementary to that on the tRNA from the 3 prime 
end is UAC. 

OK?  So this anti-codon is on the tRNA.  Anti-codons can either be 
written from the 3 prime end or you can switch them around and talk 
about 5 prime CAU.  It’s the same thing.  OK? 

So that’s one thing.  I’ll show you a picture in a moment.  The other 
thing that a tRNA has to recognize is the amino acid.  And that’s more 
complicated.  For different amino acids there are different parts of the 
tRNA molecule that recognizes specific amino acids.  And it hasn’t 
actually been figured out completely which part of which tRNA 
recognizes a particular amino acid, but the recognition is also on the 
tRNA --

-- and not really on the anti-codon.  Or certainly not the anti-codon 
alone is probably fair to say.  So let me show you a picture of a tRNA. 
tRNAs are single-stranded RNAs that fold up on themselves in a 
complex way.  OK?  Here’s the representation of the three-dimensional 
structure of a tRNA.  And these cross things are hydrogen bonds. 

So there’s a lot of base-pairing within the tRNA.  Represented more 
simply, the tRNA forms this kind of cloverleaf structure, and the anti-
codon is at one end of the tRNA.  OK?  So this is the thing that’s base 
pairing to the codon and the mRNA.  The amino acid attaches to the 
very 3 prime end of the tRNA at this site which is a CCA.  OK? 

And there is a covalent attachment of the tRNA to the amino acid at 
this CCA region.  All right.  But the part that recognizes the amino acid 
can be somewhere in the rest of the tRNA molecule.  It’s very 
complex.  OK.  So let’s move on now. 

Actually, let me tell you one more thing, though I’ll tell it to you in a 
moment.  OK.  So let’s move on now to the question of the factory. 
And by factory I mean the place where protein synthesis or translation 
takes place.  And the factory here is the ribosome. 

We mentioned ribosomes right at the beginning of the course in the 
second lecture and haven’t said a whole bunch about them since. 
Ribosomes are very large structures.  They are not membrane bound, 
but they are very large.  This is a representation of a ribosome from 
bacteria that has a small subunit and a large subunit. 

And, interestingly, ribosomes are an obligatory complex between the 
so-called rRNA, or ribosomal RNA, plus proteins.  There is a small 
subunit, this is really bad.  Let’s try this one.  Small subunit which 
consists of one ribosomal RNA of a particular kind and 33 proteins. 

And there is a large subunit.  And I tell you this not because you need 
to remember this, but you need to appreciate that this is a very 
complex structure.  It’s a very cool and complex structure.  The large 
subunit comprises of three RNAs and 45 proteins. 

You can represent the structure of the ribosome much more beautifully 
in this diagram, or in this representation, where the RNA is shown in 
gold, or the two RNAs are shown in gold, or the multiple RNAs are 
shown in gold, and some of the proteins are shown as these other 
structures and you can see the alpha helices of the proteins.  OK?  And 
what you should be able to see on this diagram, let me point to this 
one for a change, is this tunnel, this hole through the structure. 

And this is the tunnel through which the mRNAs thread as it is 
translated.  So this is truly a factory.  tRNAs come into this, the mRNA 
threads through, and as that takes place so the mRNA directs the 
synthesis of the protein.  OK.  This is a representation from your book. 
I don’t like most of the diagrams from your book so I redrew most of 
them for you, but I left this one.  This is a representation of 
translation. 

The mRNA is shown in green and the large subunit and small subunit 
of the ribosome come together, form the complete ribosome, and then 
the mRNA actually is thread through the ribosome and the protein, 
well, here they’ve called it a polypeptide chain is thread through.  So 
let’s explore this in a big more detail.  And in order to do so, I’ve got 
to conserve boards here because we are one board short. 

In order to do so I need to introduce you to the various parts of a 
mRNA.  And this is on one of the diagrams that I handed out today. 
OK?  So you don’t need to redraw it.  Just look at the diagram.  In the 
mRNA, and this is crucial for translation, there are three parts that are 
really important.  Two of them, excuse me. 

Two of them are actually added to the mRNA after it is transcribed. 
The thing at the very 5 prime end called the cap and something at the 
very 3 prime end, which is a long string of up to a couple of hundred A 
residues contiguous, which is called the poly A tail.  And these parts of 
the mRNA are crucial for the first part of translation which is initiation. 

As in replication and transcription, you can divide up these synthetic 
processes into different steps.  And initiation is the first step.  And in 
order for initiation to occur one needs the parts of the RNA that are 
added on post-transcriptionally.  You need the cap, this poly A tail --

-- and also a region that is just upstream or 5 prime of this AUG 
initiated codon in a region called the UTR, the 5 prime UTR which 
stands for untranslated region.  And you also need the AUG codon. 
OK.  And what happens is that the ribosome and various initiation 
proteins bind to the 5 prime cap and simultaneously to the poly A tail. 

So this is really cool.  The mRNA is translated as a circle where this 
poly A tail, the very 3 prime end is brought all the way around to the 5 
prime end, and you get a whole mess of proteins sitting on that part of 
the RNA and starting translation. 

So you get initiation proteins, which are called initiation factors, and 
you get ribosome assembly where the small subunit and the large 
subunit come together, and you get a tRNA carrying a methionine 
amino acid coming and sitting on the AUG. 

OK.  Let me show you more.  So here we have a cartoon, you have 
this in front of you but I’m going to show it to you in a step-wise 
fashion, of this ribosome recognition sequence.  Actually, I’m not going 

to show you now but in your handout there are pictures of the circular 
RNAs being translated. 

OK?  That’s something new and it’s something very interesting.  I’m 
not going to dwell on it now.  OK?  Where the poly A tail comes all the 
way around to that 5 prime so-called cap region.  I should just point 
out, again, I’m not going to dwell on it, the so-called 5 prime cap 
region is a modified guanine.  OK?  MEG stands for methyl guanine. 
You can call it the cap.  It designated the very 5 prime end of the 
message. 

OK.  So let us look at the sequence of translation.  And what I’m going 
to tell you, before I go through the cartoon, is that in the elongation 
process sequential tRNAs carrying their particular amino acids are 
going to come in. 

And they’re going to sit on these various codons.  And peptide bonds 
are going to form between adjacent amino acids so you get the 
polypeptide chain growing.  OK?  So let’s start off with the initiator. 
There’s your tRNA that is joined to methionine.  And I need to 
introduce you to a term now which is a charged, I didn’t have space 
before. 

The term charged tRNA refers to the tRNA covalently linked to its 
amino acid.  And then correspondingly the uncharged tRNA has no 
amino acid.  The amino acid has fallen off or been used.  OK. 

So there is a tRNA sitting on the first codon, the AUG, and that’s the 
start of the sentence.  That positions the beginning of the protein. 
Now, watch what happens.  Here comes another tRNA that 
corresponds to lucine, and you’re getting base pairing here.  That first 
tRNA is base paired to the AUG codon through its anti-codon.  The 
second tRNA is base paired to the second codon through its anti-
codon. 

And now you’ve got a methionine tRNA sitting next to a lucine tRNA. 
OK.  Everyone with me here?  And what happens now is that a peptide 
bond forms between the methionine and the lucine.  In particular, this 
methionine is going to move over to that lucine over there and lead to 
uncharging of that particular tRNA. 

Take a look.  OK, so I’ve shown you that methionine is going to form a 
peptide bond with the lucine.  Now, watch what happens next.  Here’s 

the methionine tRNA. It’s lost its amino acid, OK, so it falls off the 
message.  It’s done its thing.  It’s no longer needed. 

Along comes, no, sitting there is this lucine tRNA which is now 
covalently attached to its peptide bond to the methionine.  And there’s 
a free amino end here which designates the first amino acid 
synthesized in a polypeptide chain.  And here comes in the next tRNA 
that corresponds to a serine tRNA based paired by its codon, base 
paired by its anti-codon to the codon on the mRNA. 

OK?  And the same thing is going to happen again.  The lucine and the 
methionine is going to be transferred over and make a peptide bond 
with the serine, and so you get elongation of the polypeptide chain. 
So what I’m going to write under elongation is that adjacent amino 
acids join. 

Uncharged tRNAs leave, are released, and sequentially new tRNAs 
corresponding to codons come in. 

OK.  All right.  So this whole process goes on until the mRNA, until the 
ribosome and all these tRNAs reach a place in the mRNA where there 
is a codon that doesn’t correspond to an amino acid. 

A so-called stop codon.  And at this point there is a process called 
termination where there is a stop codon that does not code for any 
amino acid and doesn’t have a corresponding tRNA therefore.  And at 
this point the protein polypeptide chain falls off the message. 

All right.  You guys OK with that?  OK.  I’m going to refer you, I’m not 
going to go and watch this movie.  Go and watch this movie.  Go and 
watch the movie by yourselves. OK? 

I don’t want to take the time to watch it now.  It’s an animation of 
what I’ve just told you. There are some diagrams in your book.  You 
can look at them.  They talk about things called A sites and P sites in 
the ribosome.  To me that is less important than you understand the 
actual interactions between the tRNAs and the mRNAs.  Here is a 
circular RNA with that poly A tail and the 5 prime cap of binding 
proteins to initiate translation as a circular RNA. 

All right.  So, finally, let’s move to this complicated, I think fantastic 
bringing together of mutation from genotype to phenotype.  You’ve 
had a genetics module where you talked about mutations, you talked 
about the genotype, you talked about the phenotype.  We’ve been 

throwing at you genotype has got something to do with the DNA base 
sequence. 

Phenotype has got something to do with the final product, particularly 
the protein sequence.  Let’s explore that in a bit more detail now and 
ask, what is the molecular basis for changes in genotype and how do 
these correspond to changes in phenotype?  OK.  So genotype to 
phenotype. 

And I want to emphasize again that phenotype is an outcome of a 
change in function of the final product of a gene.  It isn’t necessarily 
the same as the final product of a gene.  OK?  So, for example, a 
phenotype is giantism.  Someone who is very tall.  The molecular basis 
for that could be multiple things.  It could be production of too much 
of a hormone, a protein called growth hormone so that someone grows 
too tall or taller than normal. 

OK?  So that is the phenotype is connected to the production of a 
particular protein that’s not the same as.  So here’s another diagram, 
something for you to think about.  Mutations, almost anywhere in a 
gene, can have an affect on the protein produced.  And there are two 
ways the protein produced can be affected. 

One is in the amount of protein and the other is in the sequence of the 
protein produced.  Now, if one gets a mutation in this promoter region 
or often in the introns, but particularly the promoter I’ve focused on, 
one can change the amount of RNA that is being transcribed from a 
particular gene.  And that change in the amount of RNA will lead to a 
change in the amount of protein. 

And you may get a phenotype because you’re making too little or too 
much protein.  Conversely, changes in exons can lead to changes in 
the actual sequence, the amino acid sequence of the protein and, 
therefore, to its function.  So those are two important distinctions to 
make.  OK?  So mutations can change the amount or the sequence of 
a protein. 

I’m going to go through some examples of mutations, and you will go 
through more in Section, and you are expected to know these changes 
and you are expected to know how the change in DNA sequence may 
lead or not to the change in protein sequence. 

So look carefully.  I’m not going to get through all my examples today. 
You can go and you can do the examples that are posted on your 

website.  You’ll get more practice.  And you really need to know this. 
OK, so here’s a wild type gene.  The top two strands are the DNA.  The 
bottom of the strands is the template strand. This DNA is transcribed 
into a mRNA and that is translated into the protein indicated here. 

OK?  Let’s look at an example of what happens when there is a change 
in the DNA.  So here I’ve got a change in the DNA, OK, such that this 
particular base pair has been changed.  The mRNA, oh, this is the wild 
type again.  Here’s your wild type sequence, wild type mRNA, wild 
type protein. 

This is a class of change in the DNA that is called a nonsense 
mutation.  Watch carefully.  So at this position that I’ve underlined, 
watch this.  Don’t try to write anything down.  OK?  You’ll have plenty 
of practice.  This is all posted.  Just watch.  At this particular 
underlying position, instead of a GC base pair there is now an AT base 
pair. 

And that changes this codon UGG into UAG.  And UAG happens to be a 
stop codon.  So here’s your gene, your mutant gene, here’s your 
mRNA that comes from the mutant gene, and here’s the protein.  It 
starts OK with a methionine.  But, look, the next codon is a stop.  OK? 
So the protein is truncated. 

Now, there are a number of classes of mutation.  I am going to write 
these on the board.  I’m going to ask you to go and read your handout 
carefully.  And you will cover these in section.  Again, you need to 
know them so let me list the types of mutation.  In the interest of 
time, I’m not going to go through them, but you will be able to work 
through these examples both in Section and on your own. 

So, to end off, the mutations in exons that you should know are silent 
mutations that don’t change the sequence of the protein, nonsense 
mutations that I’ve just covered, something called missense mutations 
which change the amino acid sequence, and something called 
frameshift mutations which also are likely to change the sequence of 
the amino acid. 

OK?  As I say, this will be covered.  If you want to come and see me 
personally in office hours tomorrow or the next day, please do, and I’ll 
go through these examples with you.
