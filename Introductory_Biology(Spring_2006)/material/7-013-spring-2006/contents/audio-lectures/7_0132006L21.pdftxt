Transcript â€“ Lecture 21 

What we talked about last time was formation of different types of cells in the 
embryo, different positions, different shapes. Am I on? And we talked about one 
of the overriding principles of all of this being the control of gene expression. I'll 
explore this a little more with a couple of slides in a moment. Let me just write 
some points. So we talked about the control of gene expression as being an 
overriding principle of how cells types are formed. We talked about the fact that 
cell types were formed in a stepwise fashion. 

And different parts of the embryo indeed in a stepwise fashion. Not all at once. 
And we talked about a combinatorial code -- -- of regulators that, together, 
specify different types of cells. So here we are to remind you talking about cell 
type in the formation module stepping through our board of life. And here are a 
couple of slides to remind you what we talked about in last lecture to bring you up 
to speed. You should look at the PowerPoint on the Web if you have not already. 
Cell type is defined by the proteins a particular cell makes. For example, red 
blood cells carry oxygen around the body because they make globin which is 
able to carry oxygen. 

The set of proteins that are made are defined by which genes in a cell are active, 
or expressed is the term you should know. And, therefore, which genes are 
active, also called the control of gene expression, controls which cell type forms. 
This triad is essential for you to understand what we're going to be talking about 
now and really for the rest of the course. So you should really get it. If you don't 
see me, go back and look at the previous lecture. And this lecture is going to also 
reinforce this triad. I pointed out last time that gene expression can be controlled 
at many levels. In fact, at any point from transcription, even from replication 
actually of the DNA through transcription, splicing, translation, export of the RNA 
to the cytoplasm, I haven't written up here, messenger RNA stability, protein 
modification, protein export. 

Any of these steps is along the way to getting the final gene product. And any of 
these steps can be controlled to allow the readout of the final gene product or 
not. I told you that along the way to becoming the final type of cell that a cell is 
going to become, it goes through a couple of steps. 

Or it can go through many steps, and we'll talk about that extensively today. Cells 
begin as uncommitted or naive. They don't know what they're going to become. 
They then become committed or determined to a particular fate, a position or a 
structure, but they may not look very different from that first set of uncommitted 

cells. And then they go on eventually to form so-called differentiated cells or the 
final cell type which has the function of that particular cell type. 

And so the point is if there is a stepwise formation of the final cell type. And that 
final cell type is directed through the action of regulatory factors that we termed 
inducers or determinants. There is nothing magic about these. Inducers referred 
to factors that were involved in cell-cell signaling. Determinants referred to 
regulatory factors that acted within a cell and were inherited by it. You shouldn't 
be trying to write all this down now actually because this is really review. And if 
you weren't at the last lecture, try to get some of it to wash over you and then go 
back and make sure you really know this stuff. And then as the differentiated 
cells form there is activation of a set of genes called differentiation genes which 
are the things that carry out the final cell function, the globin protein in red blood 
cells, the neurofilaments and neurotransmitters in neurons and so on. 

And we'll talk about this again as we go through today. OK. So this is not 
unrelated to what we are going to talk about today. Because what I want to do 
today is to explore with you how you get a particular kind of cell. 

And I want to use that exploration to underline some of the principles that I 
haven't yet covered as to how cell type is determined in the embryo. And the cell 
type I'm going to talk to you about is skeletal muscle. OK. So the point today is to 
look at a particular cell type and how it forms. The type we've chosen is skeletal 
muscle. Skeletal muscle is one of three kinds of muscle in your body. 

The other two being cardiac in your heart and smooth muscle around your 
internal organs. Skeletal muscle acts in a voluntary fashion to allow movement. 
It's an extremely complex structure. The final form of skeletal muscle includes 
200 proteins which have the extraordinary property of contractility in response to 
nerve input. I'm not going to talk about the contractile process, although it's 
fascinating. 

And you're not going to be tested on this for the physiology of contractility either. 
But if you're interested in this, I would suggest you look at Chapter 47 in your 
book which talks about this quite nicely. Skeletal muscles are arranged in large 
groups of fibers. And each muscle fiber is a multinucleate cell, is a giant cell that 
consists of many myofibrils or myofibrils that are together in a sheath and are 
surrounded by many nuclei. So skeletal muscle forms from the fusion of many 
mononucleate cells to give a multinucleate syncytium. And during the process of 
skeletal muscle formation there are a number of steps that one can delineate. 

One can talk about a kind of cell called a myoblast which is a single 
mononucleate cell -- -- that then fuses to form, through many steps, something 
called a myotube which is multinucleate. And these various myotubes come 
together to eventually form a muscle fiber. Muscle is obviously an extremely 
important cell type for movement. All of the meat that you eat, if you're a meat 

eater, is muscle, essentially a skeletal muscle. And there are many diseases that 
are associated with abnormal skeletal muscle. Muscular dystrophy, for example, 
is a deficit of one particular protein in the muscle, affects one in about 3,000 
boys. 

OK. So the myofibril is a very beautiful construction of many proteins organized 
in a very ordered structure. And the deal is that these proteins slide relative to 
one another during contractility. And all of these bands of proteins slide in an 
ordered fashion relative to one another as the muscle contracts. It's an 
extraordinary story in physiology itself. And I regret I don't have time to go 
through it with you. But I want to use this rather as an example of a cell type and 
to explore with you how the cell type forms during development. So the story I'm 
going to tell you has to do with a particular transcription factor called MyoD. 

MyoD, shown in green here, no, not shown in green here. That's the DNA double 
helix. Shown in red here binds to a particular sequence on DNA, its target site. It 
binds as a dimer. And it acts to activate the transcription of genes required for 
muscle formation. OK. So MyoD is a transcription factor. And, as I'll tell you a 
moment, it gives rise to the determination of skeletal muscle. Now, I'm going to 
tell you a few things about this that are general principles of how this transcription 
factor works and then I'll go through some slides with you. 

MyoD is both necessary, although I'm going to clarify that in a moment, and 
sufficient for muscle determination. This is a dyad of words that is very important, 
necessary: required for, sufficient: enough to. And whenever you're thinking 
about gene function, this is the dyad you want to think about. It may not be a 
gene, and then I'll tell you in a moment. I'm going to put a caveat here with 
respect to the necessary, OK? But necessary and sufficient is one of these 
litanies that you want to ask yourself when you're thinking about regulatory 
factors. The other thing that I want to tell you is that MyoD is a member of a gene 
family. 

What's a gene family? A gene family is a group of genes with similar structure 
and often similar function. This gene family that MyoD belongs to is called the 
MRF gene family, which stands for muscle regulatory family. And there are four 
members. And these members share some function with one another. And that 
leads us to another term which is the term redundant. MyoD is an extremely 
important gene. And if you make knockouts in mice there is some phenotype, but 
they have muscle. And it's not until you make a gene mutation in another 
member of the MRF family that you see mice that don't have any skeletal muscle. 

So redundant in this case refers to, or in all cases refers to shared function. It can 
also refer to, and does in this case, it can also refer to alternate pathways. So the 
notion that we have is that we're starting here as an uncommitted cell and we're 
going to end up over there as a differentiated muscle cell. And we can get there 
by walking straight this way, but we could also get there by walking up and out 

the back and all the way around and to that same spot in front. And both of those 
would be bona fide pathways that would get you from point A to point B. So 
sometimes there can be alternate pathways that will get you along the path of 
forming particular cell types or even carrying out some kind of biochemical 
function. 

OK? This is a general principle of biology. So let's look at this in a bit more detail 
with some slides. The notion is that MyoD binds to the promoters of many 
different genes expressed in skeletal muscle, together with other transcription 
factors, some of which may be common to all of these genes and some of which 
may be different. And it activates their transcription. And you can see I haven't 
drawn the genes in a really accurate way. These are just representations. 
There's no double-stranded DNA meant to be implied or not implied there. MyoD 
is sufficient to activate the skeletal muscle program. 

And this is a very exciting finding about 15 years ago when it was shown that one 
could take the MyoD gene, and you actually put it in a virus, and then you can 
infect a group of cells that normally wouldn't become muscle with this virus. And 
lo and behold the virus that is expressing the MyoD protein will turn these cells 
into skeletal muscle. And this was the first example of a regulatory protein that 
could take one cell type and turn it into another cell type. 

And MyoD and the other MRFs are very good at doing this. They can, for 
example, take brain cells and turn those into muscle. They can really take most 
cell types and turn them into muscle cells. So MyoD is sufficient to convert non-
muscle to muscle cells. And this is actually particularly extraordinary because, as 
I showed you in a one line schematic on this board, forming skeletal muscle is a 
multi-step program. You start off with these cells called, they call them myotome 
cells, and then you get these things called myoblasts which are dividing. The 
myoblasts start to align in arrays. And then the cells fuse with one another, which 
is really unusual for cells. I mean it's a really kind of weird cell type. 

And you get these long tubes that have got thousands of nuclei in them. And 
then the tubes start to make proteins that align themselves in these very ordered 
ways that allow them to slide relative to one another, and you get this 
multinucleate myotube that has contractile function. And what's really cool about 
MyoD is that it can start this whole process which then follows one step after 
another. So it's been termed a master regulatory switch because it can activate a 
whole cell type specific program. Now, in contrast, and this is what I was alluding 
to on the board, knockout or removal, a genetic mutation of MyoD does not 
remove skeletal muscle from mice. 

So this is a micrograph of muscle. You can see the ordered myotubes from a wild 
type mouse. This is a MyoD null mouse. And there's perfectly fine skeletal 
muscle there. It's a little, there's a little less of it, but it's still there and the mouse 
is viable. However, if you go in and you make a double mutation in the MyoD 

gene and another member of the family called Mif5, there is no muscle at all in 
any region, or no skeletal muscle at all in any region of the body. The other 
muscle, the heart muscle and the muscle around the intestine, the smooth 
muscle is fine, but the skeletal muscle is completely absent. 

So we can say that the MRFs are necessary for muscle formation but that MyoD 
is a member of a redundant gene family. And that seems to be the rule in 
biology, that genes come in families, and very often one can take over the 
function of another when one of them is mutated. And that serves as a kind of 
fail-safe for making sure that development works properly. OK. 

So here comes something to think about that I alluded to before spring break. I 
remember this. Don't know if you do. MyoD is, in the entire embryo the MyoD 
gene is only expressed in the future skeletal muscle. This is a picture of a frog 
embryo. And you can see these stripes along the back of the frog. These are 
regions of the embryo called the myotones. They're part of the somites that I'll 
talk about. And this is what's going to become the future skeletal muscle. And 
this is where MyoD is expressed. And, brilliant, only there. And now this is a 
chicken embryo and you see the same thing. MyoD is expressed in these stripes 
along the back in the future myotones of the somites. It's also expressed in the 
future limbs as the muscle of the limbs is starting to form. 

And so you're going to ask me, or you should, how does MyoD get activated just 
in the future skeletal muscle? Because in a way this is a copout. I've told you 
MyoD activates the skeletal muscle program, and it's only expressed in cells that 
are future skeletal muscle. Well, how does it know to be expressed just in this 
one region of the embryo? And to answer that question we have to actually go 
back to the dawn of time to fertilization. 

And I'm going to take you through some of the steps that will get MyoD 
expression into this particular pattern that will allow the skeletal muscle to grow 
out in just the right places of the embryo to give just the right amount and the 
right position of skeletal muscle. OK. So. And to do that we are going to pose 
some questions. And I'm going to start by telling you something and then pose a 
question. If you look at an embryo, you could look back at that chick one if you 
wanted to do or you can look at this fish. Here is your fish fillet, your skeletal 
muscle, and it is on the so-called dorsal or backside of the embryo. So last time 
we talked about dorsal and ventral as two of the so-called axis or positional 
coordinates in the embryo. 

And the muscle arises from a region that is termed dorsal which is the back. OK? 
So you might ask me, how do you know this? And I'll tell you how I know this. 
You should ask me how do I know this. OK, so I'm going to. Having put questions 
into your mouths, I'm going to tell you how you know during the development of 
an organism where a particular cell type is going to arise from. And the technique 
I'm going to tell you about is something called fate mapping. So let's begin with 

the sentence muscle, and I'm talking about skeletal muscle when I write muscle, 
arises from the dorsal or the back of the embryo. OK? And so how do you know 
this? How is this known? And it's known through use of a technique called fate 
mapping. 

What is fate mapping? So this is very interesting. The idea is to take a very early 
embryo, I've shown you here a fish embryo, and to inject one or a few of its cells 
that you can distinguish by some kind of morphological, obvious indicator from 
the rest of the embryo. And to inject those cells with a dye. So here we've used a 
fluorescent dye. And we've put that dye near the site of the embryo that's got this 
bump. OK? And as the embryo develops the cells will inherit that dye because it's 
a non-diffusible dye. And that dye will be inherited. 

And in the later fish, we're looking down now onto its brain, you can see that the 
whole front of the brain is outlined with these green fluorescent cells. And what 
this tells you is that the cell you injected initially has gone on to give rise to this 
whole front region of the brain. OK? So fate mapping tells you what cells will 
become. All right. I know it's on the slide, but it's important that you understand 
this because it is distinguished from something I'm going to tell you later. So you 
can do this for skeletal muscle. And I'm going to talk about frog development 
because so much is known. So here is a frog at the 32 cell stage. And one can 
see, because of the size of the cells and because of pigmentation differences I'll 
show you in a moment, which side of the embryo is what. And I've injected a cell 
here that's called the C3 cell, all these cells have got different names, with dye. 

And later on you can see, in this thought experiment, that the somites are labeled 
with the blue dye. So the C3 cell, and actually the one on the other side of 
embryo, are going to give rise to skeletal muscle. OK. So the reason that I wrote 
on the board what was on the slide already is that it's really important to 
distinguish what cells are going to become from when they've made the decision 
to become it. So the next thing we want to know is when cells decide what they're 
going to become. And I can rephrase that by saying when is the fate decision 
made? And fate mapping doesn't tell you that. 

All it tells you is what a cell is going to become, not when the cell has decided to 
become that thing. For this you have to do some other assay, and you do assays 
that are generally called determination assays. And I'll show you an example of 
one such assay. So here's our 32 cell stage frog embryo again with the C3 cell 
labeled. And one can go into the embryo and dissect out that cell. Frog embryos 
are about a millimeter in diameter. And you can use very fine glass needles to 
tease out that cell from the embryo. And you can grow it in a very simple culture 
method with just some saline solution and the cell will grow fine and divide. And 
you can ask whether that cell goes on to make skeletal muscle. OK? Does it 
know that it's going to be skeletal muscle? And the answer at this stage of 
development is no, it doesn't. 

So if you remove the cell, grow it in culture, it goes on to become these things 
called fibroblasts which are cells that spread out in the dish. They don't fuse. 
They don't make all these muscle proteins. And so the cell, although it's destined 
to become muscle, has not yet made the decision to take that leap of fate. 
However, if you wait a few hours, and we're actually on your handouts now. 

If you wait a few hours and you go and you remove the cells that have arisen 
from C3, which are divided now. They're still labeled and you can distinguish 
them because it's a very powerful dye and doesn't diffuse. So you can remove 
that same group of cells a bit later. And you can then grow those cells in a 
culture, in a simple saline solution. And lo and behold they go on, after some 
hours, and form multinucleate myotubes. They go on to form muscle. So 
somewhere between the 32 cell stage and the stage of a much older embryo of 
many hundreds of cells, the cells have made the decision to go onto their 
particular fate. So something has changed in terms of the regulatory genes that 
they're expressing, presumably, that allow them to go and become muscle. 

OK. So let's break this down a bit more. And let's ask the question, as to what 
inputs are required to turning on MyoD activation in a more defined sense? And 
the first thing I'm going to talk about is how the embryo knows where dorsal is. 
OK? So dorsal determination. And what I'm going to tell you is a very interesting 
tale of determinants, of cell autonomous regulatory factors that are specifically 
required to tell the embryo where the future dorsal or backside of the embryo is 
going to be. 

And I'll tell you that these determinants act to stabilize a particular protein that is 
a transcription factor, and this protein is called beta-catenin. And beta-catenin, 
once it's stabilized, so it is a transcription factor, goes on to activate a set of 
genes that are dorsal specific genes, but not MyoD. We're not there yet. Gene. 

G. I cannot spell, can I? OK. So let's discuss this using your handouts. This is a 
movie that I was showing you at the beginning. Woops. Let's show it to you again 
because I want to point something out. All right. This is a four cell embryo. Maybe 
it's going to be an eight cell embryo. Do you see how these embryos have got 
some, two cells that are kind of darkly pigmented and two cells that are lightly 
pigmented? Yeah? The lightly pigmented cells are the ones that are going to be 
the future dorsal site of the embryo. OK? That's where the muscle is going to 
come from. And these cells on the other side, on the ventral side of the embryo, 
that's where the belly is going to come from. Now, how does this happen? Well, it 
happens, and I've augmented the diagram on one of your handouts a bit so you'll 
have to add a circle. 

It happens because of movement of these purple dorsal determinants. And these 
purple dorsal determinants, as I'll show you, move within the newly fertilized 
embryo. In fact, within about 16 minutes after fertilization these dorsal 
determinants have moved in the embryo and have told the embryo where the 

future dorsal side is going to be. And the way they move is that, in fact, the early 
egg and the zygote consist of two kinds of cytoplasm, an outer sphere of 
cytoplasm that's kind of gelatinous and an inner sphere of cytoplasm that is more 
liquid. And in this outer gelatinous cytoplasm sit these purple determinants. 

And when fertilization takes place these move by a good angle, at least 30 
degrees relative to where they were, and relative to this inner liquid cytoplasm, 
which is why I've got this doted equator there to indicate that there is a relative 
movement of these determinants. OK? It's not the whole embryo that's moving. 
It's just part of the embryo that's moving relative to the other part. And this 
movement of determinants defines the dorsal and the ventral side of the embryo. 
OK. Here's a movie to show you that. OK. 

So this is a movie that is about the first 20 minutes of fertilization. And you can 
see here pigment moving from one region to another region. Now, the pigment is 
not the determinants. It just moves with the determinants. OK? So this is an 
indication that there is stuff moving, actually, from the vegetal pole region up 
towards this so-called animal pole region. So the terms animal and vegetal pole 
indicate two different sides of the radially symmetric egg. The animal pole is 
pigmented. The vegetal pole is not. And they're just useful landmarks. And, 
again, this is a frog embryo. 

Things may be similar in humans, but we understand much more about frogs. So 
that's why I'm going to tell you how things work in frogs. OK. So there is a 
manifestation of these dorsal determinants moving. These dorsal determinants 
move by a really fantastic process. They move on microtubules. Remember 
microtubules? What part of the embryo, what part of the cell were microtubules 
part of? Anyone remember? Dredge back in your memories. 

I heard something. Yes? Thank you. Cytoskeleton. Yes. See me for a frog 
afterward. So the microtubules are part of the so-called cytoskeleton. They are 
large rods of proteins, polymers of proteins. And when the sperm enters the egg 
it brings with it a centriole that is a microtubular organization center. And what it 
does, in this series of three pictures, is to take this mass of red microtubules that 
are oriented in every which way, and it organizes them so they form these 
beautiful parallel tracks of microtubules in the outer cytoplasm or between the 
outer and inner cytoplasm of the egg or of the zygote, of the fertilized egg. So the 
sperm nucleus or the sperm, excuse me, the sperm centriole is organizing this 
microtubular array. 

And it's on these tracks of microtubules that these determinants move, kind of 
like train tracks. And I'll tell you in a moment, it really is that way. So, oh, it didn't 
quite work. But OK. So here is a zygote and here is this protein I've told you 
about, beta-catenin. Now, in the zygote beta-catenin is phosphorylated. And that 
renders it unstable for various reasons. And it's also cytoplasmic. OK? With the 
action of the determinants I've been telling you about, by about the two to four 

cell stage, so very soon after fertilization the beta-catenin on one side of the 
embryo, the side where these determinants are has been dephosphorylated. So 
there is a post-translational modification. 

Dephosphorylated. And that renders it stable for various reasons. It's no longer 
subject to protein degradation. It also allows it to enter the nucleus. It allows it to 
act as a transcription factor. So these determinants are changing the stability and 
the protein structure of this beta-catenin transcription factor. Beta-catenin is really 
an important protein. This is a wild type frog embryo. Two wild type frog embryos. 
The head, tail, here's the eye forming. In embryos that have been depleted of 
beta-catenin you get these kinds of blobs that have no dorsal structures at all. 
They've got no muscle. They've got no nervous system. Nothing that would 
normally come from the dorsal side of the embryo. So what is the identity of 
these dorsal determinants? And, again, this you have partly on your handouts. 

And the identity of the dorsal determinants ergo is something that stabilizes beta-
catenin and dephosphorylates it. And what these are believed to be presently are 
two proteins called GBP and dsh. OK? You don't need to know the names. It's 
the principle that's important here. But what's very interesting is that GBP and 
dsh proteins bind to another protein called kinesin, and kinesin attaches or is part 
of the microtubule system. So you get these determinants attaching to the 
microtubules, and as these microtubules polymerize and have a rotation 
associated with them, it's not quite clear they rotate at this point, this GBP and 
dsh are associated with the microtubules. And then these two proteins, GBP and 
dsh, also called disheveled, inhibit another protein called GSK3 which is a kinase 
that phosphorylates beta-catenin and renders it unstable. 

So you're getting here dorsal determination. You can go think about this more 
clearly. Dorsal determination because you are inhibiting an inhibitor. All right? 
Complicated? Yes. Beautifully understood? More or less. This is really the most 
beautiful example that we know of how you get determination of a particular 
region of the embryo. OK. So one step. We probably have about 20 steps to go. 
And clearly we're not going to cover them all so I'm giving you a little meander 
through the number of steps that are involved. So another step informing muscle, 
that I want to tell you about, is forming a particular kind of cell from which the 
muscle will arise. 

So not only does muscle arise from cells that are dorsally located. Muscle also 
arises from a cell type called the mesoderm. The mesoderm is part of a system 
of cells that are the earliest known cell types in the embryo. And these are the 
germ layers. And the germ layers consist of mesoderm, and also of two other 
cells types called ectoderm and endoderm. OK. And these cell types were 
discovered a lot time ago. They're not differentiated cell types but they do have 
different properties. 

They are stepwise along the way to becoming different things. The mesoderm, 
shown in red here, gives rise to the muscle, blood, kidney, heart and various 
other things. OK? The ectoderm, for example, gives rise to all of the nervous 
system, and the endoderm to the gut and the lung. And they get their names 
from their position in the early embryo. The endoderm is on the inside, the 
ectoderm on the outside, and the mesoderm between the two. 

OK. How does the mesoderm form? The mesoderm forms through another 
complicated system. It forms through the action of a transcription factor called 
VegT. And this is a maternally expressed transcription factor. So we can 
distinguish maternal and zygotic effects, genetically and in development. VegT is 
maternally expressed. 

That means it is present in the egg. VegT in term activates in just one region of 
the embryo another gene called nodal. It's actually a set of genes. Nodal is a 
secreted factor. It is actually a ligand and, therefore, an inducer. And it is 
zygotically expressed. So another principle, "zygotically X" for expressed, and 
"maternally X" for expressed. OK. This is one your handouts. So we're talking 
now about the same time of development that we've been talking about but a 
different system that is working in parallel. Here is an embryo. And I've shown 
you between the 200 and the 500 cell stage that has got this VegT transcription 
factor present in the nucleus. It's a transcription factor. And you can find a 
concentration gradient of this thing. 

In one part of the embryo at this equatorial region there are low amounts of it. 
Towards the vegetal pole there are high amounts. And where you have this low 
amount of VegT you get a band of cells that's going to become mesoderm. This 
mesoderm then goes on to express this nodal gene which is a secreted ligand. 
And, for those of you who are familiar with this, it's a member of something called 
the TGF-beta family. So this gives you another set of cells to deal with. 

And what I'm going to tell you now is that to think about where the skeletal 
muscle comes from we have to superimpose the two things I've told you about 
becoming dorsal and becoming mesodermal. So the next thing we need to do is 
to talk about the dorsal mesoderm. And we can write an equation here where 
beta-catenin plus nodal makes dorsal mesoderm. And I'll tell you that this dorsal 
mesoderm has a very special property and a special name. It's called the 
organizer. Is the dorsal mesoderm the future skeletal muscle? I'm sorry to tell you 
it's not really. 

There's another step involved. And I will tell you in a moment that the organizer is 
going to induce the precursors of the skeletal muscle. So let me write this down 
just to give you a sense of where we are. OK. So let's move on here. And let's 
define dorsal mesoderm by an equation. And, in fact, you can define this whole 
process by an equation. But, of course, the genes that have to be expressed and 
so on have to be expressed in a specific temporal order. So it's not a simple 

linear equation. It's got a time component, too. OK. So here we have beta-
catenin on the dorsal side. And we have mesoderm defined by nodal signaling in 
a band across the equator. 

And if we superimpose them we get a region where both of these factors are in 
the same group of cells. And where both of these factors are in the same group 
of cells we get a special type of mesoderm formed called the dorsal mesoderm or 
the organizer. The organizer is a very famous piece of mesoderm. And it is 
famous for this reason. This is a very old experiment that was done in the 1920s 
where one could take a piece of donor tissue from a donor embryo, that is the 
future organizer, and move it to a host embryo, and put it on the side of the 
embryo where the organizer wasn't. OK? So to put it on the ventral side of the 
host embryo. And when this was done, to the surprise of the investigators, 
because they really didn't do the experiment for this reason, they found that they 
got these conjoined twins. 

Conjoined twin embryos. Here's your host embryo. And this is a second embryo 
that's formed. And you could look at see where that piece of transplanted tissue 
went. And when you did you found it was in a strip along the back of the embryo, 
but most of the second embryo, the conjoined embryo came from tissue that was 
the host embryo tissue. In other words, this piece of transplanted tissue had 
organized or induced a second embryo, including all the skeletal muscle. 

OK? And including a head and a brain and so on. This is a very famous 
experiment, very famous piece of tissue. And for this experiment the Nobel Prize 
was awarded to Hans Spemann in 1935. Here are conjoined frog embryos made 
by transplanting organizers. You can see they have two heads and they're joined 
at their tail region. What about humans? Well, the same thing is true in human 
embryos. Usually identical twin embryos will split somewhere between the two 
cell stage and a very early stage where there is something called the inner cell 
mass. And you get two identical embryos made and you get completely separate 
embryos made. Sometimes, very rarely, you get incomplete splitting of the 
embryo. 

And the organizer is split in two in a human embryo, and you land up with human 
conjoined twins. This is very rare. The survival of conjoined twins is very rare. 
There are some instances, and I've put on your handout a diagram of, these are 
actual girls who had been diagramed that were just like the frogs, with shared 
heads, with a shared trunk and separate heads. So the processes in frogs, as far 
as we know, are very similar to those in humans. 

Now, what I'm going to do because I have very interesting stuff I'd like to finish 
this off, finish off here, but I see time is creeping on, is to end off with a teaser. 
And to tell you that the final step in getting MyoD on is to activate these things 
called somites. And I'm going to take five minutes at the beginning of next lecture 
to complete this and then we will move onto our next topic. So thank you.
