1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
We're going to continue our
discussion today about cell biology,

2
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
and specifically about the subject
of signalling which we talked about

3
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
in general terms last time.
I gave you some of the general

4
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
principles about signaling,
signal propagation and signal

5
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
processing in biological systems.
And today we're going to talk about

6
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
two specific examples.
First a short-range response which

7
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
results in the production of second
messenger cyclic AMP and the results

8
00:00:41 --> 00:00:46
of that in terms of downstream
events.  And the second will be an

9
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
example of a long-range response
which requires new gene expression,

10
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
specifically in the stimulation of
cells to divide.

11
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
And the example I'll give you in
the context of wound healing.

12
00:01:00 --> 00:01:08
So just to finish up what I started
at the end of last lecture.

13
00:01:08 --> 00:01:18
As I mentioned,

14
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
the energy associated with the
binding of a single ligand to a

15
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
single receptor molecule at the
cell's surface is insufficient to

16
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
trigger any of the downstream events
that are necessary either for the

17
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
short-term or long-term responses.
And so it's necessary that the

18
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
signal be amplified.
And there are various ways that

19
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
this happens.  The first,
which I mentioned last time,

20
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
is the production of molecules which
we refer to as second messengers.

21
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
Second because they are not the
primary thing.

22
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
The primary thing is the ligand
binding to the receptor.

23
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
They come after that messenger
because they transmit the message

24
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
related to the binding of the ligand
to the receptor inside the cell.

25
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
And the example that I mentioned
and that we'll talk about in more

26
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
detail today is a second messenger
called cyclic AMP or cAMP.

27
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
I also mentioned that there are
examples of enzymatic cascades.

28
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
And, again, the purpose here is to
amplify the signal.

29
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
One enzyme turns on another enzyme
which turns on many more enzymes,

30
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
et cetera.  It's like a pyramid
effect where something little grows

31
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
to something big.
And the example I gave you last

32
00:02:28 --> 00:02:33
time was the analogy to dominos.
Pushing one over basically spreads

33
00:02:33 --> 00:02:39
the signal down the chain.
So signal amplification with

34
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
respect to second messengers,
the principle is quite simple.

35
00:02:45 --> 00:02:51
Imagine an enzyme which is in an
inactive state.

36
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
The binding of ligand to receptor
makes that enzyme go

37
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
to an active state.
And in its active state it can

38
00:03:03 --> 00:03:09
convert a substrate into a product.
Now, if that product can stimulate

39
00:03:09 --> 00:03:16
a second enzyme,
imagine enzyme two,

40
00:03:16 --> 00:03:23
which is in an inactive state now in
the presence of this product,

41
00:03:23 --> 00:03:30
is converted to an active state,
you've amplified the signal.

42
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
You've turned on a lot of enzymes
which make even more of this product

43
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
which now stimulate yet another
enzyme.  So this process then

44
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
results in a form of signal
amplification.

45
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
The same is true for enzyme
cascades.  If you imagine an enzyme

46
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
which is in an inactive state.
The binding of a ligand to a

47
00:03:57 --> 00:04:03
receptor converts that enzyme
to an active state.

48
00:04:03 --> 00:04:08
If that enzyme now acts on another
enzyme, E2 goes from inactive state

49
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
to an active state,
and that enzyme then acts on another

50
00:04:14 --> 00:04:19
enzyme, E3 goes from an inactive
state to an active state,

51
00:04:19 --> 00:04:25
again, you've gone from a relatively
small amount of stimulus propagated

52
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
through the stimulation of this
enzymatic activity,

53
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
which acts on a number of these to
make even more of these active,

54
00:04:36 --> 00:04:41
which acts on even more of these to
make even more of these active,

55
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
again, one develops signal
amplification.  OK?

56
00:04:47 --> 00:04:58
Now, these changes that take place,

57
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
both in the generation of second
messenger, as well as in the turning

58
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
on of enzymes,
often result from changes in protein

59
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
states.  I tried to give you
indications last time that proteins

60
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
are not static things.
They can move, they can interact,

61
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
and they can actually change shape.
And changes in protein states are

62
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
often reflected in changes in
protein structure,

63
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
subtle changes in protein structure,
but nevertheless changes in protein

64
00:05:26 --> 00:05:31
structure.
And these can come in noncovalent

65
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
forms.  The protein is not changed
by any new covalent bonds but by

66
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
binding to something in a
noncovalent interaction.

67
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
And the classic example of this are
G-binding proteins.

68
00:05:47 --> 00:05:57
These proteins bind guanine

69
00:05:57 --> 00:06:03
nucleotides.  That's why they're
called G-binding proteins.

70
00:06:03 --> 00:06:09
And they're often shortened and
referred to as G proteins.

71
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
We'll meet two G proteins later in
today's lecture.

72
00:06:15 --> 00:06:21
G proteins change their structure
depending on whether or not they're

73
00:06:21 --> 00:06:27
bound to GTP or GDP.
Typically, in their inactive state,

74
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
they're bound to GDP.  However, in
response to a signal transduction

75
00:06:33 --> 00:06:39
pathway, there's an exchange event
whereby GTP binds to the molecule

76
00:06:39 --> 00:06:46
and GDP is released.
This reaction is usually catalyzed

77
00:06:46 --> 00:06:54
by another protein known as a
nucleotide exchange factor.

78
00:06:54 --> 00:07:02
We're exchanging this nucleotide
for this nucleotide,

79
00:07:02 --> 00:07:10
and in so doing we change the shape
of the molecule.

80
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
When it's bound to GTP now it has a
different shape.

81
00:07:15 --> 00:07:20
And by virtue of this different
shape, it might now be able to

82
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
interact preferentially with another
molecule.  So imagine that we have a

83
00:07:25 --> 00:07:31
signaling molecule which has a shape
that looks something like this.

84
00:07:31 --> 00:07:38
A signaling protein.

85
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
Given the lack of complementarity
between this shape and this shape,

86
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
these proteins will not interact.
However, upon nucleotide exchange

87
00:07:48 --> 00:07:53
such that the protein now binds GTP
and now changes its shape,

88
00:07:53 --> 00:07:58
now we can get a productive
interaction between the G protein

89
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
and the signaling molecule.
And this can lead to a form of

90
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
signal amplification.
OK?  So that's an example of a

91
00:08:08 --> 00:08:14
noncovalent change,
and a reversible one.

92
00:08:14 --> 00:08:24
The GTP can be hydrolyzed --

93
00:08:24 --> 00:08:30
-- back to GDP,
thereby shutting the signal off.

94
00:08:30 --> 00:08:36
OK?  Another example of a
structural change in a protein but

95
00:08:36 --> 00:08:49
now a covalent one --

96
00:08:49 --> 00:08:56
-- is in the form of phosphorylation.
So imagine that we have a protein

97
00:08:56 --> 00:09:03
here, an enzyme which is
in its inactive state.

98
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
And this protein has among its amino
acids, in some critical position,

99
00:09:07 --> 00:09:12
an amino acid with a hydroxyl
residue.  Does anybody remember back

100
00:09:12 --> 00:09:17
in the Dark Ages when you were
learning your amino acid structures

101
00:09:17 --> 00:09:22
which amino acids have hydroxyl
residues?  I'm tempted to offer

102
00:09:22 --> 00:09:27
money to anybody who would remember
all three.  Anybody.

103
00:09:27 --> 00:09:33
Does anybody remember even one?
Serine it is.  Yes,

104
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
that's one.  Serine.
Anything else?  Tyrosine is another.

105
00:09:39 --> 00:09:45
Very good.  And the last one?
Threonine.  So these three amino

106
00:09:45 --> 00:09:52
acids have hydroxyl residues.
And by virtue of that they are

107
00:09:52 --> 00:09:58
subject to, or can be subject to
protein phosphorylation at the hands

108
00:09:58 --> 00:10:04
of enzymes, which I've referred to
in previous lectures, called

109
00:10:04 --> 00:10:10
protein kinases.
These proteins can be modified such

110
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
that they have a phosphate group on
them.  And this can change the

111
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
structure of the protein and make it
go from an inactive to an active

112
00:10:19 --> 00:10:24
state.  There are actually examples
where it goes the other way,

113
00:10:24 --> 00:10:29
phosphorylation takes an active
protein and makes it inactive,

114
00:10:29 --> 00:10:35
but you see the point.
Phosphorylation can change the

115
00:10:35 --> 00:10:41
activity.  And,
once again, this is reversible.

116
00:10:41 --> 00:10:47
There are protein phosphatases
which will remove the phosphate and

117
00:10:47 --> 00:10:53
return the protein to its baseline
state.  OK?  So just to give you an

118
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
example of how this
might be useful.

119
00:10:59 --> 00:11:05
Imagine that I have an enzyme here
which has an active site,

120
00:11:05 --> 00:11:12
but this active site, by virtue of
the confirmation of the protein,

121
00:11:12 --> 00:11:19
is closed.  That is the substrates
cannot get in there in order to be

122
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
modified.  At the hands of a
specific kinase that might recognize

123
00:11:25 --> 00:11:32
a hydroxyl residue right here,
the shape of this protein might

124
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
change.
So now the active site becomes open

125
00:11:38 --> 00:11:44
and the enzyme becomes active.
OK?  And likewise this can be

126
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
reversed through the action of a
phosphatase.  OK?

127
00:11:49 --> 00:11:55
So protein structures change,
activities of proteins, enzymes

128
00:11:55 --> 00:12:01
change.  And that's one way in which
we can propagate signals.

129
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
OK.  So let's now go to a specific
example.  And the example that I

130
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
want to give you is one that
hopefully not many of you are

131
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
familiar with.
If you're camping and you run

132
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
across this fellow here,
what is your immediate reaction?

133
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
You run.  You run. You never try to
feed the bear a marshmallow with

134
00:12:21 --> 00:12:25
your mouth.  That's the first thing
I learned about camping,

135
00:12:25 --> 00:12:30
you run.  This is the famous fight
or flight response.

136
00:12:30 --> 00:12:36
And when you're dealing with a bear,
you want to take the flight option.

137
00:12:36 --> 00:12:42
It's stimulated by fear,
some perception of fear.  And upon

138
00:12:42 --> 00:12:59
perception of fear --

139
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
-- through a complex physiology,
a small molecule is released from

140
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
your adrenal glands.
Glands that sit on top of your

141
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
kidneys.  This molecule is called
epinephrine, otherwise known as

142
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
adrenaline.  So this is released
from your adrenal glands and various

143
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
things happen.
One, that we're going to spend a

144
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
little time talking about,
is that your blood glucose levels go

145
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
up.  Why?  Why do you want your
blood glucose levels to go up when

146
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
you see this fellow here?
So you can run.

147
00:13:29 --> 00:13:33
Remember, that's the first thing you
want to do when you see a bear,

148
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
run.  In addition, your heart rate
goes up so you can pump more blood

149
00:13:37 --> 00:13:42
to your big muscles,
your breathing rate goes up so you

150
00:13:42 --> 00:13:46
can oxygenate those muscles,
and your blood pressure goes up.

151
00:13:46 --> 00:13:51
And there are other things that
happen as well,

152
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
but these are the most important
with respect to the fight

153
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
and flight response.
This happens because this hormone,

154
00:14:00 --> 00:14:05
epinephrine, triggers all of these
responses, actually in different

155
00:14:05 --> 00:14:10
cells within your body.
Because it's acting at distance

156
00:14:10 --> 00:14:15
sites within your body,
from the adrenal glands to the

157
00:14:15 --> 00:14:20
muscles to the liver to the heart to
your brain, this is referred to as

158
00:14:20 --> 00:14:25
an endocrine response.
An endocrine response is basically

159
00:14:25 --> 00:14:30
defined as hormones acting
at a distance.

160
00:14:30 --> 00:14:41
OK?  Produced somewhere.

161
00:14:41 --> 00:14:50
Acting somewhere else in your body.
We differentiate that with the

162
00:14:50 --> 00:15:00
paracrine response in which there is
a local release of growth factors

163
00:15:00 --> 00:15:10
and other ligands.

164
00:15:10 --> 00:15:15
So here there's a local issue.
Something happens locally, factors

165
00:15:15 --> 00:15:20
are released right in the
environment, and they act upon cells

166
00:15:20 --> 00:15:26
right in their neighborhood.
And finally a related turn called

167
00:15:26 --> 00:15:41
autocrine which is cells --

168
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
-- which release the factor and bind
it themselves.

169
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
Autocrine.  So they stimulate
themselves.  And very often you'll

170
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
start a process one of these ways.
And then the cell will take over.

171
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
Basically amplifying the signal for
itself.  OK?  Now,

172
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
in the example that I want to talk
about in the first portion

173
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
of the lecture.
We're going to deal with this one

174
00:16:02 --> 00:16:08
here, blood glucose,
the increase levels of blood glucose.

175
00:16:08 --> 00:16:14
As you probably know,

176
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
your body stores energy different
ways.  One way is in a polymer of

177
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
glucose called glycogen,
which is stored in your liver.

178
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
Another way is through the storage
of fat.

179
00:16:24 --> 00:16:30
For this response we want to
liberate the energy that's stored in

180
00:16:30 --> 00:16:36
the form of glycogen and turn it
into glucose which is much more

181
00:16:36 --> 00:16:42
consumable. It can be used directly
by your muscles to make ATP which

182
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
drives various reactions like
contractions and so on.

183
00:16:48 --> 00:16:54
So the analogy here is money in
your bank account versus

184
00:16:54 --> 00:17:00
money in your wallet.
When you're in a situation like that,

185
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
you want to transfer money from your
bank account to your wallet.

186
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
That's the direction we're heading
in this example.

187
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
In others situations,
where you've just had a huge meal

188
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
and you're not running from a bear,
you go the other way.  You take

189
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
glucose and you turn it into
glycogen, which I said is a polymer

190
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
of glucose.  Now,
this balance between glycogen and

191
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
glucose is controlled by enzymes
which are sort of in the center of

192
00:17:28 --> 00:17:33
today's example.
In this direction the enzyme is

193
00:17:33 --> 00:17:39
glycogen phosphorylase.
Glycogen phosphorylase is the last

194
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
enzyme that breaks down glycogen
into a form of glucose that can be

195
00:17:45 --> 00:17:51
then further metabolized.
Glycogen phosphorylase.  And the

196
00:17:51 --> 00:17:57
other, in the other direction,
is an enzyme called glycogen

197
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
synthase.  OK?
So the goal of this reaction,

198
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
or set of signals, will be to
stimulate this process and actually

199
00:18:06 --> 00:18:10
inhibit this process.
And you'll see how that's done in a

200
00:18:10 --> 00:18:14
second.  This is epinephrine.
Again, it's a small chemical

201
00:18:14 --> 00:18:19
produced by your adrenal glands.
As I said earlier, it's released

202
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
during the flight or fight response.
It binds to a class of receptors

203
00:18:23 --> 00:18:27
which I'll take you through.
They're called beta-adrenergic

204
00:18:27 --> 00:18:31
receptors
because they bind to a factor

205
00:18:31 --> 00:18:35
produced in the adrenal glands,
beta-adrenergic receptors.  These

206
00:18:35 --> 00:18:39
are receptors,
as you'll see, that have a complex

207
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
tortuous root through the membrane.
They go through the membrane seven

208
00:18:43 --> 00:18:46
times.  They're actually sometimes
referred to as serpentine receptors

209
00:18:46 --> 00:18:50
for that reason.
And they bind to and activate GTP

210
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
binding proteins,
G proteins, as I mentioned down here.

211
00:18:54 --> 00:18:58
And this is a particular form of G
protein called trimeric G proteins.

212
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
And you'll see why in a second.
As I mentioned,

213
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
epinephrine binds to cells in
different parts of the body

214
00:19:04 --> 00:19:07
resulting in various physiological
effects.  The ones I listed here and

215
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
another one which I didn't list here
which I find paradoxical.

216
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
Actually, I know what, I know what
the evolutionary advantage to all of

217
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
these things is,
but I don't know what the

218
00:19:17 --> 00:19:20
evolutionary advantage is to the
relaxation of the smooth muscles

219
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
around the colon during the fight or
flight response.

220
00:19:23 --> 00:19:26
Some of you may have felt this
before when you're extremely fearful.

221
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
I'm not sure why it is
our bodies do that.

222
00:19:30 --> 00:19:35
But anyway.  OK.  So
how does this work?

223
00:19:35 --> 00:19:47
So we're going to consider just the

224
00:19:47 --> 00:19:52
mobilization of glucose.
And the site of action is the liver.

225
00:19:52 --> 00:19:57
That's where glycogen is stored.
And on the cells in the liver, the

226
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
hepatocytes, on the plasma membrane
of those cells,

227
00:20:02 --> 00:20:07
there are these receptors,
these serpentine receptors.

228
00:20:07 --> 00:20:11
They look like that.
They look like snakes,

229
00:20:11 --> 00:20:16
as I mentioned.  Beta-adrenergic
receptors.  There are also

230
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
alpha-adrenergic receptors,
but we're going to focus on

231
00:20:20 --> 00:20:25
beta-adrenergic receptors.
And these bind to epinephrine

232
00:20:25 --> 00:20:30
directly.  So here's our molecule
of epinephrine.

233
00:20:30 --> 00:20:37
It physically binds to a portion of

234
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
the polypeptide chain that's
sticking out from the cell's surface.

235
00:20:43 --> 00:20:48
Now, bound on the inside to this
receptor is this trimeric G protein.

236
00:20:48 --> 00:20:54
It's called trimeric because there
are three subunits.

237
00:20:54 --> 00:21:00
There's an alpha subunit,
a beta subunit and a gamma subunit.

238
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
And in this configuration,
prior to the binding of epinephrine,

239
00:21:06 --> 00:21:12
the alpha subunit is bound to GDP.
And, as I mentioned before,

240
00:21:12 --> 00:21:19
that's usually associated with
inactivity.  So the alpha subunit is

241
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
inactive.  The binding of
epinephrine to the surface has two

242
00:21:25 --> 00:21:31
effects.  The first is an exchange
wherein the alpha subunit

243
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37
now binds GTP.
And the GDP that was present there

244
00:21:37 --> 00:21:42
comes off.  The other effect is that
the G protein,

245
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
the alpha subunit releases from the
beta and gamma subunits and they

246
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
float away.  In this,
now GTP-bound configuration,

247
00:21:53 --> 00:21:58
the alpha subunit is now active.
And it can move from this position

248
00:21:58 --> 00:22:03
to another position within the
membrane and bind to

249
00:22:03 --> 00:22:09
another protein.
In this case an enzyme called

250
00:22:09 --> 00:22:16
adenylate cyclase.
The GTP bound version of the alpha

251
00:22:16 --> 00:22:23
subunit associates with adenylate
cyclase, thereby converting it to an

252
00:22:23 --> 00:22:31
active form.  When bound to this it
becomes active.

253
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
And the consequence of that is that
the adenylate cyclase can now

254
00:22:37 --> 00:22:43
convert ATP to the second messenger
cyclic AMP.  OK?

255
00:22:43 --> 00:22:49
And this process that we've gone
through from binding of a single

256
00:22:49 --> 00:22:56
molecule to the production of a lot
of a cyclic AMP is an example.

257
00:22:56 --> 00:23:18
OK?  We've made a lot of second

258
00:23:18 --> 00:23:22
messenger from the binding of a
single molecule because we've turned

259
00:23:22 --> 00:23:25
on a lot of these,
which can go on and turn on a lot of

260
00:23:25 --> 00:23:29
these, which can go on and
make a lot of this.

261
00:23:29 --> 00:23:40
Now, there's another step in signal

262
00:23:40 --> 00:23:48
amplification here in this pathway.
There's an enzyme known as protein

263
00:23:48 --> 00:23:57
kinase A which becomes activated in
the presence of cyclic AMP.

264
00:23:57 --> 00:24:05
So protein kinase A in the presence
of cyclic AMP goes from an inactive

265
00:24:05 --> 00:24:13
state to an active state.
And when it becomes active it

266
00:24:13 --> 00:24:21
converts another enzyme,
glycogen phosphorylase, which I

267
00:24:21 --> 00:24:29
mentioned to you a moment ago,
from an inactive state to an active

268
00:24:29 --> 00:24:43
state.

269
00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
OK?  So this is a phosphorylation
reaction, similar to the one that I

270
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
drew up here.  PKA phosphorylates
glycogen phosphorylase,

271
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
making it go from an inactive to an
active state.  Another step of

272
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
signal amplification.
We can make some of this active

273
00:24:58 --> 00:25:03
which makes a lot of this active.
OK?  And this is the enzyme we

274
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
needed to turn on in order to break
down glycogen to glucose.

275
00:25:09 --> 00:25:16
Now, there's another kind of cool
thing that happens in the control of

276
00:25:16 --> 00:25:22
the reverse reaction,
because it turns out that the enzyme

277
00:25:22 --> 00:25:28
responsible for making glycogen,
glycogen synthase is inactivated in

278
00:25:28 --> 00:25:35
the presence of cyclic AMP.
So it goes from an active state in

279
00:25:35 --> 00:25:41
the presence of cyclic AMP
to an inactive state.

280
00:25:41 --> 00:25:49
So at once we turn that off,

281
00:25:49 --> 00:25:54
turn this on, and we can generate a
lot of glucose.

282
00:25:54 --> 00:25:59
OK.  So this is the reaction.
We focused exclusively on the

283
00:25:59 --> 00:26:03
mobilization of glucose here.
Just to remind you,

284
00:26:03 --> 00:26:06
this same pathway controls heart
rate, breathing rate,

285
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
blood flow.  And, actually,
some of you might have heard of

286
00:26:10 --> 00:26:13
beta-blockers.
And beta-blockers are used to

287
00:26:13 --> 00:26:16
control this exact reaction.
Beta-blockers bind to

288
00:26:16 --> 00:26:19
beta-adrenergic receptors so that
your body won't respond to

289
00:26:19 --> 00:26:23
adrenaline or epinephrine when you
don't want it to.

290
00:26:23 --> 00:26:28
So people who get really nervous
talking in front of audiences or

291
00:26:28 --> 00:26:33
taking exams in 7.
1 will sometimes take beta-blockers

292
00:26:33 --> 00:26:38
so that they don't suffer,
you know, fast heart rate or this

293
00:26:38 --> 00:26:44
feeling of anxiety and so on.
OK.  So we've turned on this signal

294
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
in response to binding of
epinephrine to the cell's surface.

295
00:26:49 --> 00:26:54
We've started all these happening.
How do we turn it off?  How do we

296
00:26:54 --> 00:27:00
deal with signal termination?
How do we turn the signal off?

297
00:27:00 --> 00:27:05
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, one might be not so obvious.

298
00:27:05 --> 00:27:16
And that is --

299
00:27:16 --> 00:27:19
-- a process which I introduced to
you last time called pathway

300
00:27:19 --> 00:27:23
modulation in which the activation
of a second pathway can actually

301
00:27:23 --> 00:27:27
inhibit the activation of
the primary pathway.

302
00:27:27 --> 00:27:32
So, for example,
I've been telling you about the

303
00:27:32 --> 00:27:37
beta-adrenergic receptors,
which through the binding of this

304
00:27:37 --> 00:27:42
kicks off a series of events which
results in the activation of this

305
00:27:42 --> 00:27:48
pathway.  There are many examples in
biology where the binding of a

306
00:27:48 --> 00:27:53
second ligand to a distinct receptor
results in the propagation of a

307
00:27:53 --> 00:27:59
signal which actually
inhibits the first.

308
00:27:59 --> 00:28:02
So, for example,
I mentioned here that there's a

309
00:28:02 --> 00:28:06
kinase that's activated,
protein kinase A.  This pathway

310
00:28:06 --> 00:28:10
might activate the relevant
phosphatase, thereby turning this

311
00:28:10 --> 00:28:13
signal down.  So modulation of the
pathway, very important in biology.

312
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
We're only really beginning to
appreciate how important it is the

313
00:28:17 --> 00:28:21
more we learn.
Another obvious example is ligand

314
00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
diffusion.  You make a certain
amount of ligand from

315
00:28:25 --> 00:28:30
your adrenal glands.
And it just diffuses eventually or

316
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
breaks down, thereby turning the
signal off.  There's also a

317
00:28:36 --> 00:28:43
phenomenon known as receptor
internalization.

318
00:28:43 --> 00:28:51
Very often when a receptor binds to

319
00:28:51 --> 00:28:55
its ligand, it doesn't just stay out
there on the surface but actually

320
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59
gets internalized inside the cell.
So I'll draw a different class of

321
00:28:59 --> 00:29:03
receptors here.
Here's the receptor.

322
00:29:03 --> 00:29:07
Here it's bound to its ligand.
I told you last time that proteins

323
00:29:07 --> 00:29:11
can get to the cell's surface
through a complex sorting pathway

324
00:29:11 --> 00:29:16
that involves actually vesicles
encapsulating the proteins and then

325
00:29:16 --> 00:29:20
bringing them to the cell surface.
Well, the reverse can happen as

326
00:29:20 --> 00:29:25
well where the proteins can be
removed from the cell's surface into

327
00:29:25 --> 00:29:29
vesicles.  Removing them from the
cell's surface then takes them away

328
00:29:29 --> 00:29:33
from the possibility of being
activated, and thereby turning

329
00:29:33 --> 00:29:38
down the signal.
Another possibility would be to

330
00:29:38 --> 00:29:43
degrade the second messenger.
OK?  Cyclic AMP is an example.

331
00:29:43 --> 00:29:47
You need to make it in order to
stimulate these various downstream

332
00:29:47 --> 00:29:52
events, so get rid of it.
And, in fact, there's a clear

333
00:29:52 --> 00:29:57
pathway for that process.
As I told you, ATP can be converted

334
00:29:57 --> 00:30:02
through the actions of adenylate
cyclase to make cyclic AMP.

335
00:30:02 --> 00:30:10
But likewise there's an enzyme,
actually, a whole class of enzymes

336
00:30:10 --> 00:30:18
known as phosphodiesterases which
converts cyclic AMP to AMP,

337
00:30:18 --> 00:30:26
thereby inactivating the signal.
These enzymes are actually very

338
00:30:26 --> 00:30:32
important in pharmacology.
There are lots of inhibitors of

339
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
phosphodiesterases which stimulate
the production or the maintenance of

340
00:30:36 --> 00:30:40
high levels of cyclic AMP and other
cyclic nucleotides.

341
00:30:40 --> 00:30:44
So caffeine for example,
one of the reasons you get a buzz

342
00:30:44 --> 00:30:48
from caffeine is that it blocks a
class of these enzymes leading to

343
00:30:48 --> 00:30:52
more cyclic AMP which gives you that
kind of nervous energy.

344
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
OK?  Another related process
involving another cyclic nucleotide,

345
00:30:56 --> 00:31:01
this time cyclic GTP.
This is broken down by a different

346
00:31:01 --> 00:31:07
phosphodiesterase.
In Viagra and like chemicals are

347
00:31:07 --> 00:31:14
inhibitors of this class of
phosphodiesterases,

348
00:31:14 --> 00:31:20
thereby leading to an over
stimulation of that pathway.

349
00:31:20 --> 00:31:27
And, finally, you can reverse the
structural changes that I mentioned

350
00:31:27 --> 00:31:33
previously.  So I said earlier that
enzymes can be activated

351
00:31:33 --> 00:31:42
through kinases.
And they can be inactivated by

352
00:31:42 --> 00:31:52
phosphatases.  I'm going to have to
move to a different board here.

353
00:31:52 --> 00:32:02
And G proteins which get activated
in the beginning of these processes,

354
00:32:02 --> 00:32:12
from a GDP bound form, through the
action of exchange factors to the

355
00:32:12 --> 00:32:22
GTP bound form,
can be inactivated by GTP hydrolysis.

356
00:32:22 --> 00:32:26
And this is often through proteins
called GAPs, which are called GTPase

357
00:32:26 --> 00:32:31
activating proteins.
They activate the GTP hydrolysis

358
00:32:31 --> 00:32:36
activity of the G protein,
thereby returning the G protein to

359
00:32:36 --> 00:32:40
its inactive state.
OK.  So that's the beta-adrenergic

360
00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
signaling pathway.
It's a classic.  You should know it

361
00:32:45 --> 00:32:50
in principle and in some detail.
It's covered extensively in your

362
00:32:50 --> 00:32:55
book.  Here's a figure
from your book.

363
00:32:55 --> 00:32:58
I won't go through the details of
this because we just did them on the

364
00:32:58 --> 00:33:01
board, but just so you know it's in
there.  Here's the production of the

365
00:33:01 --> 00:33:04
second messenger,
cyclic AMP.  And then it triggers

366
00:33:04 --> 00:33:07
this kinase cascade that I drew up
for you before,

367
00:33:07 --> 00:33:10
activation of PKA,
activation of glycogen phosphorylase,

368
00:33:10 --> 00:33:13
and the production ultimately of
glucose.  And here's the

369
00:33:13 --> 00:33:16
second messenger.
I'm pleased to see that I put this

370
00:33:16 --> 00:33:19
in the book, in my slide set last
year because the book had an

371
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
incorrect structure for cyclic AMP
in the previous edition.

372
00:33:23 --> 00:33:26
I'm pleased to see they know have
corrected the structure.

373
00:33:26 --> 00:33:30
This is the actual proper structure
of cyclic AMP.

374
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
OK.  So now want to change signaling
pathways and consider not what you

375
00:33:34 --> 00:33:39
do when you first encounter the bear,
but what do you do,

376
00:33:39 --> 00:33:44
or what does your body do if you
fail to successfully run from the

377
00:33:44 --> 00:33:49
bear?  So it's funny what you can
find on the Web,

378
00:33:49 --> 00:33:53
boy.  You can find anything you want
on the Web.  In fact,

379
00:33:53 --> 00:33:58
when I was looking up,
I was pretty sure that Viagra

380
00:33:58 --> 00:34:02
blocked phosphodiesterases.
I was pretty sure,

381
00:34:02 --> 00:34:06
but I wasn't certain so I did a Web
search.  This is true.

382
00:34:06 --> 00:34:10
I did a Web search.  And,
God, I cannot believe what I came

383
00:34:10 --> 00:34:14
across.  It's unbelievable.
But you can find some pretty nasty

384
00:34:14 --> 00:34:17
bear wounds on the Web as well,
and here's one of them.  So this guy

385
00:34:17 --> 00:34:21
didn't run fast enough.
So what's going to happen?

386
00:34:21 --> 00:34:25
What is his body going to do
following an injury such as that?

387
00:34:25 --> 00:34:29
Well, obviously he needs to heal
the wound.

388
00:34:29 --> 00:34:33
Your body is remarkable in its
ability to detect damage and fix it.

389
00:34:33 --> 00:34:37
So we're going to heal the wound.
And this is an example of one of

390
00:34:37 --> 00:34:42
these long-term effects of a
signaling pathway.

391
00:34:42 --> 00:34:46
Whereas, this was short-term,
everything was happening in the

392
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
cytoplasm, generation of glucose to
be secreted.  This is a long-term

393
00:34:50 --> 00:34:55
effect.  The effect has to take
place ultimately in the nucleus

394
00:34:55 --> 00:34:59
because we need to turn on gene
expression to convince cells to

395
00:34:59 --> 00:35:04
divide and heal the wound.
This may be a troubling picture.

396
00:35:04 --> 00:35:10
Maybe I should go back to the bear.
There.  So if we imagine the skin,

397
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
which is a tight complex of cells
forming a protective layer against

398
00:35:16 --> 00:35:21
the elements and so on keeping stuff
out that should be out,

399
00:35:21 --> 00:35:27
in that should be in.  In a wound
you breach that structure,

400
00:35:27 --> 00:35:33
you get a scratch.
And one of the things that happens,

401
00:35:33 --> 00:35:40
as you bleed into that wound, is
that small packets,

402
00:35:40 --> 00:35:48
former bits of cells called
platelets bind to the edges of that

403
00:35:48 --> 00:35:55
wound.  And the platelets then
release a factor imaginatively

404
00:35:55 --> 00:36:03
called platelet-derived
growth factor.

405
00:36:03 --> 00:36:09
And platelet-derived growth factor,
otherwise known as PDGF stimulates

406
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
other cells to divide.
And specifically it stimulates

407
00:36:15 --> 00:36:22
cells called fibroblasts which sit
underneath these cells normally as

408
00:36:22 --> 00:36:28
part of the connective tissue
underneath the epithelial cells.

409
00:36:28 --> 00:36:35
In the presence of PDGF, the
fibroblasts proliferate.

410
00:36:35 --> 00:36:39
And this results in the formation of
a scar.  OK?  And what we want to

411
00:36:39 --> 00:36:44
understand now is how is it that
PDGF stimulates fibroblasts

412
00:36:44 --> 00:37:21
to divide?

413
00:37:21 --> 00:37:29
So we can model this process in cell
culture.  We can extract fibroblasts

414
00:37:29 --> 00:37:37
from your skin and put them in a
tissue culture dish,

415
00:37:37 --> 00:37:45
let's say one times ten to the fifth
cells.

416
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
So this is cell number on this axis
and this is days in culture on this

417
00:37:51 --> 00:37:57
axis, one, two,
three, four days.

418
00:37:57 --> 00:38:03
If we plate 100,000 fibroblasts in
a tissue culture dish,

419
00:38:03 --> 00:38:09
in the absence of growth factors
they won't divide.

420
00:38:09 --> 00:38:14
They'll just sit there.
But if we add PDGF or other growth

421
00:38:14 --> 00:38:19
factors, the cells will divide,
and therefore we'll see an increase

422
00:38:19 --> 00:38:24
in cell number.
So, again, the question is how does

423
00:38:24 --> 00:38:29
that happen?  What is the mechanism
that allows that to happen?

424
00:38:29 --> 00:38:43
Oops.  What did I do?

425
00:38:43 --> 00:38:48
Well, here we're talking about
another class of receptors.

426
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
These are called growth factor
receptors.  And these are different

427
00:38:54 --> 00:38:59
from seven transmembrane receptors
in that they have,

428
00:38:59 --> 00:39:05
on their cytoplasmic side,
enzymatic activity, specifically

429
00:39:05 --> 00:39:10
kinase domains.
These receptors are also enzymes.

430
00:39:10 --> 00:39:16
And their enzymatic activity is to
add phosphates to other proteins.

431
00:39:16 --> 00:39:21
In this configuration, however,
they're inactive.

432
00:39:21 --> 00:39:27
What the growth factor does is
causes those receptors to dimerize

433
00:39:27 --> 00:39:33
with one another.
To become in close proximity to one

434
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
another.  So the growth factor
serves to link them.

435
00:39:39 --> 00:39:46
Here's our growth factor.
And in this now increased proximity,

436
00:39:46 --> 00:39:53
these kinase domains become active.
And the consequence of that is we

437
00:39:53 --> 00:40:00
get phosphorylation of the
neighboring protein.

438
00:40:00 --> 00:40:11
We call this transphosphorylation.

439
00:40:11 --> 00:40:14
So ligand induced activation,
transphosphorylation.  And now what

440
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
we've done, on the inside of the
cell, is to create a structure.

441
00:40:18 --> 00:40:22
And it's the formation of that
structure that then allows the rest

442
00:40:22 --> 00:40:51
of the process to work.

443
00:40:51 --> 00:40:56
These phosphorylated residues act as
the binding sites for other proteins.

444
00:40:56 --> 00:41:01
The first one is known
as an adaptor protein.

445
00:41:01 --> 00:41:10
An adaptor protein which binds to a

446
00:41:10 --> 00:41:16
class of proteins to that I referred
to previously,

447
00:41:16 --> 00:41:22
a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.
And that then allows the exchange

448
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
factor to stimulate the exchange of
a small GTP binding protein,

449
00:41:28 --> 00:41:34
which is generally bound to GDP and
inactive, to stimulate the exchange

450
00:41:34 --> 00:41:40
of GTP for GDP.
This small GTP binding protein is a

451
00:41:40 --> 00:41:45
protein called RAS,
a very important signaling molecule.

452
00:41:45 --> 00:41:50
And, actually, a very important
cancer molecule as well.

453
00:41:50 --> 00:41:55
Mutationally activated in a high
percentage of cancers.

454
00:41:55 --> 00:42:00
When you now have RAS in its GTP
bound state, it can activate

455
00:42:00 --> 00:42:05
a kinase cascade.
Which I'll go through with you on

456
00:42:05 --> 00:42:11
slides in a moment.
It first activates a protein called

457
00:42:11 --> 00:42:16
RAF which then activates a protein
called MEK which then activates a

458
00:42:16 --> 00:42:21
protein called ERK.
ERK is a map kinase.

459
00:42:21 --> 00:42:27
It's a kinase itself.
Its enzymatic activity is to

460
00:42:27 --> 00:42:33
phosphorylate other proteins.
MEK phosphorylates ERK so it's

461
00:42:33 --> 00:42:40
called a map kinase kinase.
And RAF is a kinase itself which

462
00:42:40 --> 00:42:47
phosphorylates this kinase so it's
referred to as a map kinase kinase

463
00:42:47 --> 00:42:54
kinase.  I'm not making it up.
OK?  So it stimulates a kinase

464
00:42:54 --> 00:43:02
cascade, similar to what I
introduced you to before.

465
00:43:02 --> 00:43:06
And then, as you'll see,
ERK, which is a cytoplasmic protein,

466
00:43:06 --> 00:43:11
moves from the cytoplasm into the
nucleus.  I'll show this to you on

467
00:43:11 --> 00:43:16
slides, and it's in your book as
well.  And in the nucleus this

468
00:43:16 --> 00:43:21
kinase phosphorylates transcription
factors which then bind to target

469
00:43:21 --> 00:43:26
genes turning them on stimulating
the cell to divide.

470
00:43:26 --> 00:43:31
I would have drawn that for you but
we're running out of time.

471
00:43:31 --> 00:43:35
So I will show it to you instead on
the overheads.

472
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
There's our wound.
So here's the pathway.

473
00:43:39 --> 00:43:43
It's just straight out of your book.
Here are the growth factor

474
00:43:43 --> 00:43:47
receptors, again,
not dimerized, not active.

475
00:43:47 --> 00:43:51
The growth factor causes the two
proteins to come together in close

476
00:43:51 --> 00:43:55
apposition.  This causes the kinase
activities to get stimulated

477
00:43:55 --> 00:44:00
resulting in the phosphorylation of
the cytoplasmic tails.

478
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
The adaptor protein then can bind to
the phosphorylated tail.

479
00:44:04 --> 00:44:09
This then stimulates through an
exchange factor not shown here,

480
00:44:09 --> 00:44:14
the exchange of GDP for GTP, making
an active RAS molecule.

481
00:44:14 --> 00:44:19
This then can activate RAF making
it now an active kinase which

482
00:44:19 --> 00:44:24
activates MEK making it an active
kinase which activates ERK called

483
00:44:24 --> 00:44:28
map K here for map kinase.
This now goes into the nucleus of

484
00:44:28 --> 00:44:32
the cell from the cytoplasm,
and in the cytoplasm it can

485
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
encounter transcription factors.
It then phosphorylates those

486
00:44:36 --> 00:44:40
transcription factors which bind to
their target genes turning on gene

487
00:44:40 --> 00:44:44
expression and leading to a change
in the cellular phenotype.

488
00:44:44 --> 00:44:48
And the change in the cellular
phenotype that we're talking about

489
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
here is cell division,
the details of which we'll cover

490
00:44:52 --> 00:44:56
next time.  So this is sort
of a static picture.

491
00:44:56 --> 00:45:00
But to give you a more dynamic
picture of what's happening here,

492
00:45:00 --> 00:45:05
I borrowed from the Biocreations
Website an animation,

493
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
which I find very helpful and,
actually, is kind of funny as well.

494
00:45:10 --> 00:45:15
So we're going to start this
process much the same way that we've

495
00:45:15 --> 00:45:20
just talked about using the terms
that I used on the board.

496
00:45:20 --> 00:45:25
Oop.  We need sound.  Let's do that
again so you can hear it

497
00:45:25 --> 00:45:29
in all its glory.  OK.
So the first thing is the receptors

498
00:45:29 --> 00:45:33
get dimerized by the growth factor
leading to the phosphorylation of

499
00:45:33 --> 00:45:37
these cytoplasmic tails.
And then this protein, which is the

500
00:45:37 --> 00:45:41
adaptor, it's called grab-2 grabs
onto one of those phosphorylation

501
00:45:41 --> 00:45:45
sites.  It has attached to it an
exchange factor called SAS here.

502
00:45:45 --> 00:45:49
OK?  So that's the first thing that
happens. You recruit this signaling

503
00:45:49 --> 00:45:53
complex to the membrane.
Once you have it there it's now in

504
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
close proximity to RAS which is,
if you remember, a membrane

505
00:45:57 --> 00:46:01
associated protein.
It's now in its inactive stage,

506
00:46:01 --> 00:46:06
its GDP bound state.
Oops.  Sorry.  We'll just have to

507
00:46:06 --> 00:46:13
watch that again.
Oh, no.  Wait.  Wait.

508
00:46:13 --> 00:46:19
Wait.  Go back.  Forget you saw
that.  That's the end.

509
00:46:19 --> 00:46:26
You never want to see the ending.
Oh, wait a minute.  OK.  Here we go.

510
00:46:26 --> 00:46:32
OK.
So next we're going to activate RAS.

511
00:46:32 --> 00:46:36
It gets a little kick in the butt.
GDP comes off.

512
00:46:36 --> 00:46:41
GTP comes on.  Now RAS is active.
It's now capable of interacting

513
00:46:41 --> 00:46:46
productively with RAF,
the first of these kinases,

514
00:46:46 --> 00:46:50
the map kinase kinase kinase.
And it's going to cause it to

515
00:46:50 --> 00:46:55
become active.
Once it's active it's now capable

516
00:46:55 --> 00:47:00
of activating the next guy
in line, which is MEK.

517
00:47:00 --> 00:47:03
Now MEK is active,
and it's going to phosphorylate ERK,

518
00:47:03 --> 00:47:06
and now ERK is phosphorylated and
active.  Now, there have been a

519
00:47:06 --> 00:47:09
couple of other steps,
which you can look at, at home,

520
00:47:09 --> 00:47:12
but the RAS went from a GTP bound
stage to a GDP bound state.

521
00:47:12 --> 00:47:15
I told you that you can turn these
signals off up here.

522
00:47:15 --> 00:47:18
That happens in this pathway.
Another GAP comes along and turns

523
00:47:18 --> 00:47:21
RAS off.  And here's a protein
phosphatase, which is going to clip

524
00:47:21 --> 00:47:24
off the phosphate,
thereby turning MEK off.

525
00:47:24 --> 00:47:28
So each of these steps is
reversible.

526
00:47:28 --> 00:47:35
But, importantly,
we're down here at this level where

527
00:47:35 --> 00:47:42
ERK has been phosphorylated.
And now it's capable, dammit.

528
00:47:42 --> 00:47:49
All right.  We'll have to watch it
again.  Wait a minute.

529
00:47:49 --> 00:47:56
Come on.  OK.  Here we go.
I know.  It's like a video game.

530
00:47:56 --> 00:48:02
OK.
So ERK is active.

531
00:48:02 --> 00:48:06
And now it's going to go in the
nucleus.  Phosphorylate Jun,

532
00:48:06 --> 00:48:10
one of these transcription factors.
And upon doing so the transcription

533
00:48:10 --> 00:48:14
factors dimerize,
bind to the promoter of a target

534
00:48:14 --> 00:48:18
gene.  They recruit RNA polymerase.
And this leads to the production of

535
00:48:18 --> 00:48:22
new gene expression.
mRNAs that go into the cytoplasm

536
00:48:22 --> 00:48:26
get translated into proteins that
convince the cell now it's

537
00:48:26 --> 00:48:29
time to divide.  OK?
So I encourage you to look at this

538
00:48:29 --> 00:48:33
to get the details.
Now, if you just wait one more

539
00:48:33 --> 00:48:37
second.  In the last 30 seconds I
want to point out the fact that

540
00:48:37 --> 00:48:41
these pathways,
while we're teaching to you as

541
00:48:41 --> 00:48:44
simple linear pathways,
are actually highly complex.

542
00:48:44 --> 00:48:48
Pay attention to this clock here.
It's 11:54.  Highly complex, highly

543
00:48:48 --> 00:48:52
interactive, not linear,
and therefore we frequently

544
00:48:52 --> 00:48:56
analogize what's happening inside a
living cell to an integrated

545
00:48:56 --> 00:49:00
circuit.
And increasingly these days in

546
00:49:00 --> 00:49:04
biology, we're thinking about these
things in analogy with computers,

547
00:49:04 --> 00:49:09
and actually relying extensively on
computers to help us understand how

548
00:49:09 --> 00:49:13
that complexity actually works using
methods from chemistry and physics

549
00:49:13 --> 00:49:18
and mathematics and other
disciplines in a new and emerging

550
00:49:18 --> 00:49:22
area called systems biology,
which you might be interested in.

551
00:49:22 --> 00:49:27
And the new Biological Engineering
major will have a strong focus

552
00:49:27 --> 00:49:30
in this area.  OK.
