7.013 Introductory Biology, Spring 2006 
Transcript – Lecture 5 

OK.  So we’re going to continue with the discussion about 
biochemistry, and specifically focus on enzymes today.  Professor Sive 
introduced those to you briefly in her last lecture. 

I’m actually covering for her today.  This is one of her lectures but she 
has given me her material, so hopefully it will go fine.  She wanted me 
to remind you a little bit about energetics, specifically that a negative 
Delta G in a reaction implies that the reaction can occur 
spontaneously, that is if the products have lower energy than the 
reactants.  And so given enough time this will happen in that direction. 

But importantly for many reactions an activation energy might be 
necessary to get that reaction started.  And if the activation energy 
can be sufficiently high then in a reasonable amount of time the 
reaction will actually never proceed forward.  And it’s the job of 
enzymes actually to deal with that problem, as we’ll discuss.  So this is 
the third of three lectures in biochemistry.  We’re going to transition 
next week to genetics, and I’ll be actually teaching that section on 
genetics. 

Before we get into today’s lecture proper, Professor Sive wanted to 
quiz your knowledge from previous lectures.  So firstly in this 
structure, this polypeptide structure, the question is was the valine 
amino acid, the Val, added last or first in this reaction?  Specifically 
true or false, was it the last amino acid added?  False.  Very good.  It 
was the first. 

Because amino acids are added in polypeptides from the amino end to 
the carboxy end.  And in this case Val is next to the amino ends.  So 
the second question is in this reaction shown here, the generation of 
sucrose from glucose and fructose, which has a positive Delta G, does 
this release energy or consume energy?  Specifically true or false, 
does this?  False.  Good. 

So the Delta G is positive, which means to get this reaction to go you 
need to add energy.  And there are various ways of adding energy.  In 

a synthetic case a chemistry example you might add heat or you might 
link this to another reaction that actually produced energy.  And finally 
is activation energy required only to initiate reactions with a positive 
Delta G?  No.  Very good. 

So, as we just talked about, activation energies can be important both 
for reactions that consume energy and give off energy.  And so even in 
situations where reactions give off energy, it may be necessary for an 
enzyme to deal with this activation energy problem in order to speed 
up the rate of the reaction.  OK.  So Professor Sive gave you examples 
previously comparing the cell to a factory.  And I think it’s a very apt 
analogy. 

And it’s particularly apt with respect to the subject of today’s lecture 
which are enzymes.  There’s a great deal of interest these days in the 
MIT community and around the research community around the world 
in nano technology, building tiny little machines that can do work. 
Well, I would say that proteins are the consummate example of nano 
technology.  These are small entities, five to ten nanometers in 
diameter, which carry out very specific and very powerful reactions. 

So proteins are already nano particles to the nth degrees.  And the cell 
is itself remarkable in this respect because the cell, which is only ten 
to thirty microns in diameter not only has all these nano particles 
doing all this work, but it also contains the blueprint information for 
building those. 

It has the synthetic capability for making the raw materials that they 
act on.  And it has the micro machining capability to build the nano 
machines.  And this all takes place in a very, very tiny space.  So the 
cell is an unbelievable example of engineering that we can only just 
aspire to replicate.  OK.  So, again, the subject of today’s lecture is 
enzymes as biological catalysts. 

And I want to introduce this by putting some of the earlier stuff into 
perspective.  So Professor Sive told you in her last lectures about 
macromolecules --

I’m not going to talk about all of them that she’s told you about, but 
she’s talked about DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid which is responsible for 
information storage. 

She also told you about RNA, ribonucleic acid, a related polymer, 
nucleic acid.  RNA actually has many functions in the cell.  Information 
transfer is an important one, but it’s not limited to that.  RNAs can also 
function structurally. 

When we talk about protein synthesis, for example, you’ll see that RNA 
molecules surface scaffolds for the ribosome which is the machine that 
makes proteins.  And they can also be catalysts.  This was not 
appreciated for a long time.  We now know that in biology, in biological 
systems today RNAs can function as catalysts.  And we actually 
believe, in an evolutionary sense, that RNAs were the first catalysts. 

Before there were polypeptides and proteins, life was made possible 
through the catalytic properties of RNA molecules.  And your book 
actually talks about those in the chapter that you just read.  They’re 
called ribozymes, for RNA ribose-based enzymes.  And then there were 
proteins.  And we’ll talk about proteins as catalysts today, but 
importantly proteins also serve structural roles. 

They compose, for example, the long cables that extend throughout 
your cells to give them the proper shape and allow them to move. 
They’re important carrier proteins.  For example, hemoglobin which 
carries oxygen to different parts of your body.  There are proteins that 
bind to iron, for example, and deliver it from your diet to the relevant 
parts of your body that are protein specific to that function.  And then 
there are catalysts. 

And it’s the catalysts that we’ll focus on today.  Now, the way that 
proteins carry out these diverse functions is that by virtue of their 
amino acid sequence, their primary sequence of amino acids, they fold 
up into a particular shape.  Proteins have very specific three-
dimensional shapes.  And these shapes then dictate their function. 
Depending on what the protein is supposed to do, it will have a 
different shape. 

So, for example, there are proteins that, as I mentioned, function as 
structural elements within the cell like long cables.  They form 
polymers.  And these proteins have shapes a little bit like Lego blocks 
that link together, one to the next, and as such line up into these long 
polymers.  So some proteins have structures that just allow them to 
bind to one another and form long polymers. 

The proteins that we’ll talk about today, catalysts, usually have, 
maybe always have a specific shape.  And I’m taking a three-
dimensional structure here and simply cutting a slice through it, so 
you’re looking at sort of the middle of the protein cut in half.  Here’s 
the overall three-dimensional structure of the protein.  And in this 
portion here, which we call the active site, is where the chemical 
reaction takes place. 

Now, we know a lot about many enzymes, as well as other proteins in 
the cell, based on the primary amino acid sequence that we can 
determine from the genes sequence.  But we also have seen what 
these look like using methods in x-ray crystallography. 

We won’t actually review the methods of x-ray crystallography with 
you, but basically sufficed to say that you can take a pure protein, 
allow it to form into a crystal, shine x-rays through it, the x-rays get 
diffracted based on the position of the atoms in the protein. 

And you can then interpret that diffraction pattern to tell you what the 
structure of the protein was.  So these are not just cartoons.  We 
actually know what these proteins look like in great detail.  Not only do 
we know what the proteins look like in many instances, but we also 
often know what the protein looks like in complex with some reactant 
to which its bound. 

And these we call co-crystals.  Crystals that occur between the protein 
and the substrate molecule that it’s going to act upon.  And so we 
have a very clear idea of what the chemistry is that’s going on inside 
the enzyme’s active site.  And this information is not just useful for 
biological purposes, but the more we understand enzymes and the 
specific structure of enzymes the more we can do about it. 

So in disease, for example, where you have an enzyme that’s causing 
some pathogenic problem, if you want to inhibit that enzyme, the 
more you know about what’s happening here the more precise you can 
be in your design of an inhibitor.  And that’s now happening, and I’ll 
tell you an example of that later in the lecture. 

Now, I’m just curious to know whether you have a sense for why the 
protein has its particular structure, and also what distinguishes one 
active site from another? There are thousands of enzymes inside this 
cell.  Do they all look like this or does each one look different? 

Are they all the same?  No.  They’re all different.  They’re different in 
shape, as I indicated earlier because their primary amino acid 
sequence causes them to fold up based on local interactions between 
amino acids into helices and beta pleated sheets.  As I told you, they 
interact with each other.  And that gives them that large sort of three-
dimensional structure.  But it’s the nature of the amino acids in this 
active site which ones are there. 

Is it a glutamic acid, a valine, a methionine?  Which specific ones are 
present there and how are they oriented which allows them to bind to 
particular molecules, substrates, and do chemistry on them?  And the 
reason that proteins are much better catalysts, or much more powerful 
catalysts than RNAs, is that our RNAs are fairly boring.  They only 
have four subunits.  They don’t have that great diversity of chemical 
reactive groups that you find in proteins. 

Proteins, as you heard, are composed of 20 distinct amino acid 
subunits.  They are all differently chemically in those R groups that 
Professor Sive told you about before, and they can do different 
chemistry in the active site.  So different enzymes are different by 
virtue of their overall structure and the particulars within the active 
site that allows them to do what they do. 

I wanted to mention briefly that we often use the suffix ìaseî to 
designate an enzyme, polymerase, DNA polymerase, sucrase.  You’ll 
see those terms all the time.  Whenever you see it, it reflects that the 
protein is an enzyme, the suffix A-S-E.  OK.  Again, just for 
perspective, where do the proteins come from in a sense? 

How does the cell know what to make?  We’re going to get into that in 
later lectures, but just so you have a sense of it, the information to 
produce a particular protein with a particular amino acid sequence, 
and therefore shape and therefore function, is encoded in the genes, 
which are in the DNA.  This information is transferred into an 
intermediary molecule, which is RNA. 

Again, you’re going to learn about these details.  You don’t have to 
worry about them so much right now.  You’ll learn about these details 
later in the class.  And the particular RNA molecule that carries the 
information from the DNA is called the mRNA, messenger RNA.  And 
that mRNA is then translated into the protein itself.  So the reason that 
we have proteins of particular sequence and particular shape and 

particular function is that we have different genes that carry the 
information to make those specific proteins. 

OK?  And we’ll see that again in detail in later lectures.  OK.  So very 
importantly we talked last time, you talked last time about the 
energetics of reactions, as illustrated here, that in many reactions 
there is the energy of the reactants themselves, the energy of the 
products, as well as so-called activation energy. 

That is the energy that’s required to make that reaction go, which can 
be greater than the energy of the reactants.  The important function of 
enzymes is to lower the activation energy to reduce the threshold that 
these reactants have to go over in order to carry out the reactions that 
lead to the products. 

The enzyme’s function is to lower the activation energy.  And the way 
that enzymes do that is several-fold, as we’ll review.  The most 
important thing I can imagine you can take away from this lecture is 
the understanding that what enzymes do as catalysts is to lower the 
activation energy. 

They don’t change the nature of the reactants, they don’t change the 
nature of the products, they actually don’t change themselves in the 
course of the reaction, but what they do is to facilitate the reaction by 
lowering the activation energy.  And that is the nature of catalysis. 

So enzymes are biological catalysts. 

Their function is to increase the rate of a reaction.  As I said, reactions 
that release energy will happen spontaneously, but it might take a 
very long time.  Enzymes function to increase the rate at which those 
reactions can happen.  And they can do so in impressive ways.  They 
can increase the rate by a million-fold.  So they really can change 
whether a reaction will take place in the lifetime of an individual 
compared to whether it would take place in microseconds. 

OK?  And many biological processes have to happen within the course 
of microseconds or seconds.  And, therefore, without enzymes those 
would not be possible.  Importantly, as illustrated on this slide, 

enzymes do not change the Delta G.  They don’t change the Delta G of 
the reaction. 

Delta G is the same.  What’s being changed here, in the presence of 
an enzyme, a catalyzed reaction, is the activation state.  The 
energetics of the products and the energetics of the reactants don’t 
change, so the Delta G does not change.  So, again, they do so by 
lowering the activation energy.  And this is often done by combining 
the reactants with portions of the protein to create what’s called a 
transition state complex. 

And it’s the nature of that transition state complex, the protein bound 
to the substrates that allows the activation energy to be reduced, as 
you’ll see in a moment. 

I want to emphasize that the enzyme itself is the same at the end of 
the reaction as at the beginning.  The enzyme does not change.  It 
goes through one reaction cycle.  It’s exactly as it was when it started. 

And that’s important because it means that the enzyme can be reused. 
This is not a single reaction process.  The enzyme can be used over 
and over and over again, which is another part of the definition of a 
catalyst.  OK.  When we talk about enzymes, reactions, reactants and 
products, we use slightly different nomenclature, and so it’s important 
that you see that and get to recognize it. 

The enzyme, often denoted as E, combines with substrates, one or 
more substrates, described as S, to form a complex which is 
designated ES.  That’s where this transition state is taking place.  And 
then following that the enzyme releases the products. 

And, importantly, the enzyme can then be recycled to do this process 
again on new substrates to produce new products.  So the S in this is 
the reactant or substrate, and P is the product, and the ES is the 
enzyme transition state complex. 

As I said at the beginning, enzymes have very particular specificities. 
They are designed to do specific reactions.  They don’t bind to every 
old molecule in the cell. 

And this is determined, as I said, by the shape of the enzyme and its 
complementarity to the substrates to which it binds.  And that’s 
illustrated here on a slide from your book where you can see an 
enzyme with its active site.  And here are three potential substrates. 
Based on the shape of the active site and the particular side chains on 
those amino acids, the yellow one and the red one will fit into the 
active site, but the green one will not. 

So specificity, in this case, is determined by the complementarity 
between the shape of the substrates and the shape of the active site. 
And then, by virtue of their positioning within the active site, the 
enzyme is now catalyzing the binding, covalent attachment of the 
yellow one to the red one to produce the product, as shown here. 

So specificity is achieved by the complementarity between the active 
site and the substrates.  The transition state is achieved by a variety 
of conditions that the enzyme places upon the substrates. 

So the substrate fits in much the way a key fits into a lock into the 
active site.  This then promotes the formation of this transition state. 
And that is done by three distinct, sometimes related but, distinct 
mechanisms.  One is the fixing of the orientation of the two substrates 
to one another. 

They’re not just randomly floating around in solution anymore. 
They’re literally aligned next to each other in a way that will promote 
the chemical reaction.  And that’s one way that the activation state is 
lowered because now you don’t have the problem of kinetic energy of 
the molecules floating around.  A second is what’s referred to as 
induced fit, and in your book referred to as strain. 

And I’ll show you a slide of this in a second.  And this is important 
because often times the activation energy is due to the fact that the 
molecules have to get contorted.  It’s not a native confirmation of the 
molecules during the chemical reaction. They actually have to get bent 
in ways that they don’t like to be bent.  The enzyme helps this by 
adding chemical groups around it which promote the bending process, 
promote the sort of straining of chemical bonds that allows additional 
reactions to take place. 

So the enzyme produced is this so-called induced fit.  And, finally, the 
enzyme can, depending on the nature of the chemistry, apply charge. 

We know that there are charged amino acids, both positively and 
negatively charged amino acids.  There are acid-base reactions that 
often take place within the enzyme’s active site.  So the presence of 
charges can facilitate those acid-base reactions. 

They can donate positive charge or donate negative charge to allow 
the reaction to take place more rapidly than it would do 
spontaneously.  And those are illustrated in a following slide, actually. 
This just shows you an example, a specific example of a reaction that 
is catalyzed by a particular enzyme.  Here we have the substrate.  It 
happens to be a sugar, a disaccharide sugar, sucrose, and is made up 
of the subunits glucose and fructose for you to use sucrose, which you 
can eat. 

To produce energy you need to break it down into glucose and 
fructose.  And this reaction is catalyzed by a particular enzyme called 
sucrase.  And you can see in diagrammatic form what happens here. 
Here’s sucrase.  Here is its active site.  You can see that its structure is 
exactly complimentary to the substrate. 

So the substrate now floats in, binds to this active site.  There’s then a 
chemical reaction, which is basically the addition of water to break this 
bond, which is catalyzed by the enzyme.  And then the products are 
released, the enzyme remains as it was at the beginning of the 
reaction, and it can go through the reaction cycle one more time.  This 
is the picture that shows you the various ways that the active site can 
promote the transition state complex. 

One, as I mentioned, is orientation.  Again, two substrates here are 
positioned next to each other in the way that we want them to react. 
So that’s helpful.  A second is the straining process, the fact that the 
protein can impose, in a sense, stress on the molecules, the 
substrates, change their shape, and in that way facilitate the chemical 
reaction, and finally, as I mentioned, to charge. 

In the case of acid-base reactions there are positively and also 
negatively charged amino acid side chains that can contribute their 
positive or negative charge to facilitate the reaction.  And this is one 
final example.  Here we’re talking about an enzyme that adds a 
phosphate group onto glucose in an early step in glucose metabolism. 
And, in this case, the enzyme actually changes its shape as a 
consequence of the substrate binding to it. 

This happens [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].  At least he didn’t point to 
me.  [LAUGHTER]  What was that all about?  I was actually prepared 
to have those sorts of interruptions on Monday which we always have. 
I don’t know what that was all about. 

So what was it all about, pretty boy?  [LAUGHTER]  And who is pretty 
boy anyway?  Somebody back there.  OK.  Well, that was fun. 
Anyway.  Well, we were talking about enzymes.  So, again, some 
enzymes, as indicated here in the example of hexokinase, will actually 
change their shape in response to the binding of the substrate, here 
glucose. 

And this is maybe a more interesting example of something I’m going 
to come to later, which is that proteins are not static in their shape. 
They actually do change a little bit, and the ability of them to change 
can tweak, can tune their activities so that positioning the exact 
structure of the active site can change based on other things that are 
happening in the protein. 

And that’s a useful thing with respect to regulation.  You can turn up 
the activity of an enzyme.  You can turn down the activity of an 
enzyme based on the changes that the overall structure can make. 
OK.  And then just to bring the subject of specificity of enzyme 
function home, here is an example from real life.  This is a packet of 
Equal, which you may use.  It’s an artificial sweetener. 

And you may have noticed on the very back of the Equal packet it says 
phenylketonurics: contains phenylalanine.  And you might have 
wondered, what the hell is that all about?  Does anybody know?  Is 
anybody a phenylketinuric?  You don’t actually have to say if you are 
or not, but does anybody know what this means?  Yes.  It’s close. 
You’re actually thinking of a similar disease called alkaptonuria. 

But you’re on the right track.  Right.  You cannot break it down.  And 
specifically what you cannot break down is phenylalanine. This is a 
disease that affects only about one in 12,000 individuals.  It’s a so-
called metabolic disease.  We’ll talk about metabolic diseases later. 
And the important point here is that the enzyme that’s responsible for 
breaking down phenylalanine is altered in these individuals in one 
residue, one amino acid out of 451. 

Protein has 451 amino acids.  One of those amino acids in the active 
site is not what it’s supposed to be.  And therefore it cannot bind 
properly to phenylalanine.  And that causes a defect in the breakdown 

of this and the build up of a toxic substance, as I’ll show you in a 
second.  This is NutraSweet.  You might not have known that it is a 
dipeptide composed of aspartic acid and a phenylalanine linked 
together with an extra group on it, probably to make it more soluble or 
ability to pass through cells more easily. 

In your body, when you take in phenylalanine from the diet like with 
respect to NutraSweet, when NutraSweet gets into your body, the 
phenylalanine and the aspartic acid get broken apart so you have 
increased phenylalanine, but however you intake phenylalanine from 
your diet it’s normally converted enzymaticly by an enzyme called 
phenylalanine hydroxylase which converts it from phenylalanine to 
tyrosine. 

And the tyrosine is either used for stuff or it’s broken down itself.  It’s 
actually used for making melanin.  And so these same patients who I 
have just mentioned, these phenylketonurics also have lighter hair and 
lighter skin because they cannot make as much tyrosine, and therefore 
don’t make as much melanin. 

But the real problem is not that.  The real problem is that if you have 
too much phenylalanine in your blood because you cannot break it 
down properly.  Then you build up phenylpyruvic acid which is a 
natural byproduct of phenylalanine.  And this stuff is toxic when 
present in high levels.  And so the patients, these phenylalanine 
hydroxylase mutants, which are now called phenylketonurics, have a 
defect in this enzyme, cannot carry out this reaction properly.  And 
therefore this spontaneous reaction happens more readily. 

And therefore you have high levels of this toxic compound that causes 
mental retardation, actually.  It causes some sort of neuro toxicity. 
And that’s how it was originally defined.  And the reason we’re telling 
you about this is that this is an example of enzyme specificity because 
this enzyme is different, as I said, in only one of 451 amino acids.  The 
408 amino acid is supposed to be an arginine, and instead is a 
tryptophan.  And as a tryptophan it cannot properly bind to or carry 
out the chemical reaction. 

And therefore the enzyme fails, levels build up, and the individuals 
have a very, very severe phenotype.  A very, very severe disease 
presentation, I should say.  Now, I indicated a little bit ago that 
enzymes can be tweaked in their function.  Enzymes are not just static 
in their ability to interact with substrates and catalyze reactions. 

In fact, they are highly regulated.  And they’re regulated by a number 
of different both external and internal processes.  So regulation of 
enzyme function is critical with respect to producing the right sort of 
products at the right sort of times and rates within your cells.  And one 
key factor that determines the regulation of a given enzyme is the pH, 
the pH of the solution that the enzyme finds itself. 

Now, why would that be?  Does anybody have a sense for why that 
would be?  Why does the pH of the cell’s environment determine the 
enzyme’s function?  Yeah.  Say it again. 

Right.  So proteins can denature at, extreme pHs in both directions, 
actually.  But more importantly they’re optimized based on the side 
chains that are present within the active sites.  So, as I said, there are 
charged amino acids which have different pKas.  And depending on the 
pH of the solution, they’ll either be protonated or not protonated.  And 
their state of protonation, whether or not that they have a proton 
bound to them, will affect their ability to carry out the chemistry. 

So enzymes are perfected to function in the pH conditions they find 
themselves.  So, for example, salivary amylase, which breaks down 
carbohydrates in your saliva, has a pH of around seven because your 
saliva is around pH seven.  So it’s been evolved to function best at 
that pH.  If you increase the pH or decrease the pH it doesn’t work so 
well, as indicated by this reduced reaction rate at higher and lower 
pHs. 

In contrast pepsin, which is an enzyme that is present in your stomach 
acid and in your small intestine where the pH is very, very low, works 
best at low pH.  If you raise this to increase pH, it doesn’t work at all 
well because presumably at the increased pH things that should be 
protonated are not protonated.  And now those reactions that should 
be taking place in the active site don’t. 

This is also another interesting example of regulation in the sense that 
pepsin breaks down proteins.  And you actually don’t want rampant 
protein breaking down enzymes floating around in your body. 
Particularly, you don’t want them in the cells that make pepsin.  You 
could imagine that the cells that make pepsin run the risk that pepsin 
is going to eat all the proteins in those cells.  It doesn’t happen 
because the pH of those cells is around seven, and therefore the 
pepsin isn’t active. 

It only becomes active when it gets dumped into the acid environment 
of the stomach and the small intestine.  So that’s another justification 
for tweaking the activity of enzymes.  Another example is 
temperature. 

Again, based on the structure of the protein, which is strongly 
influenced by the temperature, proteins have optima.  Most of our 
proteins function best at what temperature? 

37 degrees Centigrade.  98.6, or whatever, Fahrenheit.  But that’s not 
true of all organisms.  As I mentioned in the first lecture, there are 
organisms that live in thermal vents where the regular temperature is 
80 degrees centigrade or higher.  Their enzymes actually work like 
crap at 37 degrees, but they work great at 72 or 75 degrees.  They’ve 
been optimized, based on their structure, to function best at the 
temperature in which they find themselves. 

And finally, or almost finally, covalent modification. 

And there are different ways that proteins can be modified after 
they’ve been made in the translation process.  Other stuff can get 
added to them covalently.  And I’ll give you an example of 
phosphorylation --

-- because it's going to come up in later lectures, too.  Phosphorylation 
which means that the protein gets an extra phosphate group added to 
it.  And if you imagine, for example, an enzyme, it has an active site 
here --

-- which is blocked at its front door.  Stuff cannot get into it because 
this little arm is kind of hanging over the front of the active site.  What 
can happen is that a reaction, another chemical reaction that adds a 
phosphate group --

Phosphorylation, which is another enzymatic reaction, can cause the 
enzyme to open up and allow substrates to come through.  And this is 

a reversible process.  Other enzymes called phosphatases can come 
along, clip the phosphate off and return the enzyme to its inactive 
state. 

And then, finally, there are partners, other molecules that the enzyme 
binds that help the enzyme do its thing.  And these are summarized on 
this slide, which comes from your book.  There are three groups that 
are shown here.  You should probably be familiar with what these 
groups are and examples from within them.  For example, cofactors. 
These are usually small metal molecules, atoms. 

Iron, copper and zinc are three that are shown here.  These participate 
in the chemistry.  They actually participate in the catalysis for enzymes 
that require them.  And, actually, many enzymes in your bodies do 
require such cofactors.  And that’s one of the reasons it’s encouraged, 
you’re encouraged to eat zinc and stuff like that, because many of 
your enzymes need it.  Another class called coenzymes, this happens 
to be a horrible name in my opinion, a really, really bad name. 

It’s one of these historical names that we’re stuck with.  But these are, 
again, partner molecules.  They’re really substrates.  They’re really 
substrates in the reaction, but they’re called coenzymes because 
they’re used by many different enzymes in coupled reactions.  And an 
example here is NAD which is involved in a hydrogen donating and 
receiving.  And this I mention specifically because it’s the product, or 
it’s the byproduct of one of the vitamins you eat, vitamin B. 

And many of these coenzymes are the products of vitamins.  And so 
that’s one of the reasons it’s important to eat your vitamins.  And 
finally what are called prosthetic groups, the same word as artificial 
arms and legs.  Prosthetic groups like heme, which is present in 
hemoglobin, flavins, other things, which are involved, again, in helping 
the enzyme or the protein do its thing.  And the distinction between 
these and these is that they are larger. 

They’re actually synthesized by the body, as opposed to these which 
are just taken up in the diet.  OK.  This is an example, and I’ll go 
through it quickly for lack of time.  This is an example of one chemical 
reaction.  What we’re talking about here is an enzyme called 
dihydrofolate reductase.  This is an important enzyme in producing 
molecules that are required to build nucleotides in your body, both 
DNA and RNA precursors. 

Without this enzyme you cannot make those things, you would be 
dead.  It’s a very critical enzyme both in biology and in medicine. 
Dihydrofolate reductase happens to be one of the targets of an 
important chemotherapeutic agent called Methotrexate.  It’s used 
because cancer cells grow a lot.  You want to inhibit their ability to 
grow, so you inhibit their ability to carry out this reaction to produce 
this relevant product. 

And also in bacteria it’s the target for a particular antibiotic called 
Trimethoprim.  Folic acid you know that you take in from your diet. 
And it’s then broken down in a way, or not broken down.  It’s modified 
in a way that it becomes useful for these synthetic reactions.  And 
that’s the job of dihydrofolate reductase.  Dihydrofolate has two 
hydrogens positioned at the seven and eight positions. 

And tetrahydrofolate has four hydrogens at these four positions.  And 
it’s the tetrahydrofolate that you want to use, that you need to use for 
these subsequent reactions.  So the enzyme then, dihydrofolate 
reductase adds hydrogens.  It reduces dihydrofolate to 
tetrahydrofolate.  And it utilizes a cofactor NADP shown in green here 
to do that. 

It’s the NADP, NADPH which transfers the hydrogens to the 
dihydrofolate.  This is a little bit hard to see because it goes pretty 
quickly.  You might look at it on the Web or at home.  This is the 
dihydrofolate coming in.  You can see in white the enzyme actually 
moving.  It moves in order to carry out the chemical reaction.  And 
you can see in green the NADP, initially NADPH coming in, interacting 
with the dihydrofolate, transferring the hydrogens and allowing it to 
become tetrahydrofolate. 

OK?  So that’s one example of an enzymatic reaction.  OK.  In the final 
eight minutes, and we do have a lot to get through, so if you could 
just hang in there until five of that would be good, I want to talk about 
another form of regulation, and that is specifically the existence of 
inhibitors and activators. 

So, again, the regulation of enzyme function is extremely important. 
You want to make sure that the enzyme is working at optimal rates, 
higher or lower, depending on the circumstances.  And this can be 
adjusted naturally inside the cell by other molecules that can function 
to inhibit the enzyme or to activate the enzyme.  And, as I said, we 

can also do that medically by making inhibitors or activators that 
change the activity of enzymes inside our cells. 

Terminology.  These inhibitors and activators can be reversible or 
irreversible.  They can either bind and come off and bind and never 
come off.  This takes the enzyme out of play.  It goes to the bench.  It 
cannot work anymore.  This one can come back off and the enzyme 
can continue to function. 

They can be competitive.  And I’ll show you what this means in a 
second.  Competitive --

-- versus noncompetitive.  And, again, I’ll tell you what that means in 
a second. 

Competitive is illustrated here.  If this is the active site and this is the 
substrate which would normally fit into that active site, a competitive 
inhibitor, like the name suggests, competes with the active site.  It 
gets in there and prevents the substrate from binding.  Pretty simple 
concept, right?  A noncompetitive inhibitor functions by binding 
somewhere else on the protein and changing the structure of the 
active site. 

So here again is the substrate.  It could bind to this active site, but 
when the noncompetitive inhibitor binds over here it changes the 
active site.  And now the substrate cannot bind.  So it’s not competing 
with the substrate directly, but it’s affecting the ability of the substrate 
to bind to the active site. 

Now, these noncompetitive inhibitors, and you can also have 
molecules that activate the enzyme at these other sites, are binding to 
portions of the protein that we call allosteric sites.  A term you should 
be familiar with, allostery, allosteric regulation. 

And what this is, again, are molecules.  Sometimes they’re products of 
the reactions.  Sometimes they are other things that bind somewhere 
on the protein, not at the active site, which change the nature of the 
active site.  So in this example we see an allosteric site next to an 
active site.  The binding of an activator can lock this enzyme, it 

happens to have four subunits, into a confirmation where the active 
site is open. 

Or another small molecule, an inhibitor can bind to the allosteric site 
and lock the protein into an inactive confirmation.  OK?  So allosteric 
regulation, sensing some other molecule and changing the activity of 
the enzyme.  Why would you want to do that?  Before I get to that, let 
me give you one real-life example of inhibition.  It comes from my 
world.  Cancer drugs increasingly are becoming more specific, and this 
is the best example. 

I don’t have time to go into it in detail now for lack of time, but this is 
a drug made by a local pharmaceutical company called Novartis which 
binds to one of these kinases, these phosphorylating enzymes, 
important in a particular type of cancer.  It is a competitive inhibitor of 
ATP.  ATP needs to bind to an active site for this protein to function. 
The drug called Gleevec is a competitive inhibitor of ATP, therefore ATP 
cannot bind, therefore the enzyme cannot function, therefore the 
cancer cells cannot stay alive, therefore the cancer patient is cured. 

Great example.  It happens to be true.  So this is not just theory, not 
just bench biology.  This is real-life in pharmacy in this example.  And 
this is a three-dimensional picture of Gleevec in green bound to the 
active site of the kinase called able shown in the red and blue ribbons. 
OK.  So, again, feedback regulation. 

The reason that we have allostery and changes in regulation relate to 
a diagram like this.  And the important points here are that these 
enzymes that we’ve been talking about almost never function in 
isolation.  They’re almost always in pathways.  Something produces 
product one, the next enzyme works on product one to make product 
two, and so on and so forth.  And you actually, the cell wants to 
coordinate the activity of these enzymes so that the right amount of 
product is made at the bottom of the process. 

It’s like the regulation of an assembly line in a factory.  You don’t want 
to make too many tires if you don’t have enough cars.  So when you 
have enough tires you feedback the tire generation and you bump up 
the car generation.  The same thing happens in biology.  This pathway 
A goes to B goes to C.  C splits to D and F goes to G goes to E. 
Depending on how much G you have, you might feedback on this 
enzyme to make less F. 

And you might feed forward, you might have positive feedback on this 
enzyme to make more E.  And this regulation is done by this sort of 
allosteric process whereby the G product to an allosteric reaction 
might inhibit the enzyme producing F and might activate the enzyme 
producing E.  And this example shown here from an actual metabolic 
process, the generation of isoleucine is a specific example whereby 
when you make enough isoleucine the isoleucine will bind back to the 
enzyme way up here in the pathway to shut it down. 

Once I have enough isoleucine, isoleucine binds to this allosteric site 
on this enzyme, which now slows down the production of these 
intermediates, and therefore results in the production of less 
isoleucine.  I left off two slides on energetics and ATP, but I’ll mention 
those next time.
