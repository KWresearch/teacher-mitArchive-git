Transcript â€“ Lecture 30 

While she's writing that up, I also wanted to clarify a point that was raised by a 
TA last time at the end of last lecture.  Some of you might have thought about 
this fact, and it's important to clarify at least as best we can. 

I told you last time that people who inherit a defective copy of the RB, 
retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene are highly predisposed to the 
development of retinoblastoma, a tumor of the eye.  Actually, these patients end 
up getting bilateral retinoblastoma, affecting both eyes, and typically have about 
a dozen tumors, independent tumors. 

And, if you recall, those tumors arise through the loss of the normal copy of the 
RB gene in the cells that give rise to these tumors.  And I also told you that the 
RB gene is a critical regulator of cell cycle progression.  And so you might have 
wondered why don't these people get all sorts of tumors?  Why are they 
predisposed only to retinoblastomas? 

Why not breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and so on?  We don't 
actually know in complete detail why that is, but we suspect that there's a 
fundamental difference between retinal cells and other cells with respect to their 
requirement for RB gene function.  So I told you previously that RB is a regulator 
of the cell cycle.  Specifically it regulates the entry of cells from the G1 phase of 
the cell cycle into S phase.  It blocks.  And it has to, itself, be inactivated for 
tumor development. 

Or rather for normal cell cycle progression.  An we think that in retinal cells this is 
the key regulator of S phase progression, of S cell cycle entry, so that if you get 
rid of it you now have deregulated cell cycle control and tumor development. 
And we suspect that in other cells where RB is almost certainly important --

-- there are probably other factors, let's call them X, which can also regulate cell 
cycle progression.  So that even if the cell were to lose RB, there are other 
factors that can, in a sense, back it up.  And in these cells, in most of your cells, 
although RB loss might contribute to tumor formation, it's not sufficient.  In these 
cells other events must be necessary to inactivate, one way or another, these X 
functions.  OK?  So hopefully that helps clarify. 

Now, I told you last time, the last two times that we now think of cancer as a 
clonal progression from normal cells to tumor cells.  The acquisition of mutations 
in cellular genes, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and collectively these 

give rise to cells that are malignant and potentially life-threatening.  This is 
interesting information from a scientific point of view, but is it useful?  Why do we 
want to understand these cancer-associated genes? 

Why do we want to understand these mutations?  Well, there are a variety of 
reasons why.  We're going to focus today on therapy which is directed against 
the mutations that arise in cancers.  But there are other purposes that I just want 
to mention to you. 

Early detection.  Cancer is most easily treated when caught early.  If we know 
somebody has cancer, before the cancer has spread, they have a much better 
chance of curing that individual. 

And so it's desirable to have tests for early detection.  And increasingly there are 
PCR-based tests looking for cancer cells in bodily fluids.  Sometimes the blood, 
urine or other tissues.  PCR-based tests looking for mutations in the cancer-
associated genes, looking for cells that have a Ras mutation or have a p53 
mutation or have an RB gene mutation and so on. 

So this is not commonplace, but there are now tests, commercially available tests 
that are based on PCR looking for such mutations.  There are also blood tests for 
what we call cancer markers. 

You've probably heard of the PSA test for prostate cancer.  There are certain 
other tests for other types of cancer.  These are blood tests that detect 
inappropriate levels of something, often something produced by the cancer.  And, 
again, increasingly, as we understand what happens in cancer cells, we'll have 
more and more precise cancer makers that will be detectable in the blood in a 
very simple screening test so that you can go to the doctor every year, go 
through one of these tests and know whether or not you have an early form of 
one or another type of cancer. 

That's not, again, happening today, at least in a widespread way, but it will 
happen in the years to come.  And when it does, we will be in a position to do 
what we call cancer prevention.  Rather than waiting until somebody has a full-
blown tumor and trying to treat it, which is difficult, we will hopefully detect those 
tumors at a very early stage and then prevent their progression. 

So this is not treating cancer really, but treating the hyperplasias I told you about. 

Or early lesions, benign lesions before they progress to true cancer.  And we 
think that this will be easier to do because those cancer cells will have acquired 
fewer mutations.  And, therefore, it will be easier to design very specific agents 
that will effectively limit their proliferation or possibly even kill them. 

OK.  Today we're going to focus on the use of this information for better 
therapies, ways to design more effective, more specific anti-cancer agents.  And 
I'll come towards the end to using this information and related information to do 
better diagnosis to try to distinguish two people who have clinically similar 
tumors. 

But those tumors might actually be quite different at the molecular level, and we'd 
like to understand that.  OK.  Before we get into sort of the New Age cancer 
treatments, I thought I should at least mention to you conventional therapies. 

Right now, if you have to have cancer treatment, you might get one of the drugs 
that I'm going to tell you about later in the lecture, but more likely you're going to 
get what we call a conventional anti-cancer treatment.  And these anti-cancer 
treatments have actually been around for quite some time, and they do work. 
They do work, but they don't work as well as we need them to work.  Radiation is 
a very common anti-cancer agent, as you probably are aware. 

And there are a variety of drugs that we list along with radiation like Adriamycin, 
Cisplatin.  And there are a variety of other chemical agents, which together are 
grouped because they cause DNA damage.  These are DNA damaging agents, 
and they're also effective anti-cancer agents. 

There's another category of anti-cancer agents which is exemplified by a drug 
called Taxol, and there is a series of Taxol-related compounds.  And these are 
microtubule inhibitors.  Microtubule inhibitors.  And these therefore, microtubules 
are important in mitosis, if you'll remember the mitotic spindle.  So these are anti-
mitotic drugs. 

And these drugs do work.  And we think that they work in part because cancer 
cells are rapidly dividing cells compared to most normal cells in your body.  And, 
therefore, if you damage their DNA or you block their ability to divide you'll more 
effectively block cancer growth compared to normal cell growth. 

Now, overall, in the context of cancer, what we're looking for, and actually in the 
context of other diseases as well is something called a therapeutic window.  A 
therapeutic window is defined as a difference in the concentration of a drug 
necessary to kill the cell of interest versus normal cells in the body.  These drugs, 
anti-mitotics and DNA damaging agents will kill normal cells. 

So if you look at a graph of percent killing versus drug concentration, normal cells 
will eventually die.  The hope is that cancer cells will die sooner.  And this 
difference is defined as the therapeutic window. 

And that does exist for many of these drugs for many different types of cancer. 
And so these agents will, in fact, give initial responses.  Unfortunately, they tend 
not to be, tend not be durable.  That is patients tend to relapse.  Not always but 

tend to relapse in response to these agents.  This slide just makes the same 
point that many of the drugs that we know about affect the cell cycle either in S 
phase during DNA synthesis or in M phase during mitosis. 

And this also points out that many of these agents cause the death of cancer 
cells by inducing apoptosis, inducing the death of cells.  In contrast to most, but 
not all, most normal cells in the body, which in response to that same 
concentration of drug, will not die.  And instead those cells will arrest at some 
point in the cell cycle and repair the damage. 

And the difference, what makes up the therapeutic window in many cases, is that 
the cancer cells are dying at a given concentration, the normal cells are staying 
alive and simply arresting.  However, there are other cells in the body that in 
response to the same drug at the same concentration will undergo apoptosis. 
And you actually know what those cells are if you've thought about cancer 
chemotherapy before.  It's the cells that support the hair follicles. 

Those cells die in response to these drugs.  And that's why cancer patients lose 
their hair.  It is cells in the blood, in the bone marrow which will die in response to 
these concentrations.  And that's why cancer patients get anemic.  And in cells of 
the lining of the stomach and intestine which will die in response to these drugs. 
And that's why cancer patients feel sick, feel nauseous.  So there are side effects 
in response to these drugs. 

And that's because many cells, some cells in your body will also die by 
apoptosis.  Now, we've learned, actually my lab has participated in this process, 
that the p53 tumor suppressor gene that I've told you about is actually quite 
important in guiding the responsive cells to these drugs.  Many normal cells turn 
on p53 in response to this damage and arrest.  Those other cells that I just told 
you about will turn on p53 and die. 

And cancer cells, likewise, if they have a functional p53 gene will turn it on.  And 
this will induce apoptosis.  And it's the difference between cancer cells turning on 
p53 and dying compared to normal cells turning on p53 and resting, it gives the 
therapeutic window.  Unfortunately, as I've mentioned to you, about 50% of 
human cancers carry p53 mutations.  And given that p53 is important in this 
response, if you don't have p53 then you won't die, or won't die as effectively, 
and that limits the therapeutic window. 

And this is one of the reasons why cancer therapy is not as good as it should be 
and why cancer cells will sometimes come back, because they're now no longer 
responsive to the drug, at least especially responsive to the drug.  So we'd like to 
do better, and we think we can do better by taking advantage of the information 
that we've gained over the last 30 years about cancer-associated mutations. 

And I'm going to review for you in detail the first three of these new agents, all 
three FDA approved in the last five years or so for the treatment of one or 
another type of cancer.  And I'll also mention anti-Ras therapies, although we 
don't have an FDA approved drug for those.  If there's time I'll mention inhibitors 
of an enzyme called telomerase, as well as anti-angiogenesis.  There are other 
therapies, not drug-based therapies but other therapies that are under 
consideration, and in some places in use. 

Gene therapy, replacing cancer mutation genes.  Immunotherapy, trying to 
convince your immune system to attack your cancer.  And also cancer prevention 
strategies, which I mentioned actually last time, trying to make vaccines against 
viruses that are associated with certain types of cancer including human 
papillomavirus and cervical cancer.  So Ras is the first one that I'd like to mention 
to you. 

And it's an example of where we haven't done enough.  We don't know enough. 
Even though we know that Ras is mutated in 30% of human tumors, 30%, 90% 
of pancreatic cancers carry Ras mutations.  Pancreatic cancer is one of the worst 
killers in the cancer category.  If you get pancreatic cancer, of a particular type at 
least, it's a very, very, very serious disease.  We know that these tumors carry 
mutations in the Ras gene but we cannot do anything about it at the moment. 

So, as I've told you, Ras proteins are involved in signaling proliferation.  And this 
takes place through kinase cascades, phosphorylating enzymes that 
phosphorylate other enzymes in a cascade.  When you have a mutation in Ras, it 
turns the protein on in a constitutive fashion leading to increased signaling down 
these pathways and increased proliferation. 

We know some of these enzymes.  I've told you about Raf and MEK and MAP 
kinase.  And so many drug companies are now trying to find inhibitors that might 
block those enzymes, small molecule inhibitors, drugs. 

And because these are kinases, the approach is to try to find ATP analogs. 
Drugs that look like ATP, can get into the active site of the enzyme and compete 
for ATP, and thereby block enzyme function.  Some of these drugs work, at least 
in cells in culture. 

There's a bit of a fear that these pathways are so commonly used in normal cells 
that the drugs might be highly toxic and therefore not tolerated.  And, importantly, 
we don't understand what these arrows mean well enough.  We have some basic 
ideas, but we don't have enough detail to know exactly which kinase to inhibit in 
exactly which type of tumor.  So this is in progress but it's not quite there yet.  I'll 
come back to another couple of stories related to ATP analogs that do work and 
are now in use in cancer treatment. 

Before I do, I want to mention another class of inhibitors, and these are 
antibodies. 

Antibody-directed therapy.  Cancer cells often up-regulate proteins on their 
surface.  I mentioned one last time in the context of breast cancer. 

It's a protein called HER2.  I mentioned the fact that 30% of breast cancers have 
an amplification of the HER2 gene and, therefore, make more of this HER2 
receptor on their cell surface.  So, in contrast to normal cells which will have a 
certain concentration of this receptor on their surface, cancer cells, breast cancer 
cells that carry this amplification will have a much higher density. 

Maybe ten times or a hundred times the level of this receptor on their surface. 
And they are using that increased level of receptor to increase the signal 
downstream of that receptor to promote proliferation.  Now, the receptor is 
responding to ligands as it would normally do.  And therapy is based on the fact 
that the ligand has to bind to the receptor in order to activate it. 

And so what was done by a company called Genentech out in California was to 
make antibodies that block to the receptor, that bind to the receptor and block the 
binding of the ligand to the receptor.  So these are anti-HER2 antibodies.  And 
this drug, which is now approved by the FDA, is called Herceptin. 

And it works.  For those breast cancer patients who have amplification, too much 
of this receptor on their surface, Herceptin works and can give them months, 
sometimes years of symptom-free survival.  It's not curative, unfortunately, but it 
does extend life.  And it's therefore an extremely important drug.  This is just a 
blocking antibody.  There's nothing attached to the antibody.  It's just blocking the 
binding of the receptor to its ligand and thereby blocking the function of the 
receptor. 

But antibodies can also be linked to toxins or radionuclides, and thereby deliver 
bad stuff to the tumor cell, either a toxin or something that will irradiate this cell. 
And these are being tested currently.  There are no FDA approved versions of 
this, but I suspect that will change in the years to come. 

So Herceptin is an effective antibody-based therapy.  There are a couple more 
now, but it was the first.  And this is actually from the Genentech website which 
gives you a little bit of information about Herceptin and shows you a bottle of 
Herceptin as you would see in the pharmacy.  And this diagram is just a 
reiteration of what I've told you already.  Normal cells have low levels of the 
receptor on their surface, cancer cells have higher concentrations of the receptor 
on their surface, and the antibody binds to the receptor thereby blocking its 
function. 

OK?  So this is a clear example.  We learned that Herceptin was over-expressed 
in cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer.  The company made an antibody 
and it works. 

Another story, my favorite story relates to a disease called chronic myelogenous 
leukemia --

-- or CML.  CML is a disease that affects young adults, adults and children.  Child 
patient shown here. 

It is leukemia so it's a disease of the blood.  It affects both the blood, as well as 
the bone marrow.  And we've learned a lot about this disease over the years.  It's 
not a very common disease.  It only affects about 4,000 or 5,000 people in this 
country per year.  And it falls in stages.  Initially the person is diagnosed with 
CML based on relatively low concentrations of, low levels of white blood cells in 
their circulation. 

And then they progress with that phase in what's called the chronic phase where 
there are still relatively low levels of white blood cells, higher than normal but 
lower than are dangerous.  However, this can progress over time through an 
accelerated phase where there's even higher levels of white blood cells in the 
blood to the final phase which is called blast crisis where the levels of white blood 
cells really shoot up.  And this is lethal. 

And these patients invariably progress through these stages and eventually died. 
So what have we done?  This is a picture of what the blood cells look like in a 
normal individual.  This is a white blood cell you could see in a CML patient. 
There are higher levels, and they can be even higher than this.  This disease has 
been studied for a very long time. 

And we now know that there's a signature mutation, a mutation that takes place 
in almost all CML cases.  It's a translocation that rearranges two genes called 
BCR and ABL and places them together on a translocated chromosome.  There's 
a swapping of genetic information from chromosomes 9 and 22 such that there's 
production of a new gene called BCR-ABL that results in a new protein, a fusion 
protein that has a little bit of this BCR protein and a little bit of this ABL protein. 

And you can see in the karyotypes of these individuals that they have an 
abnormal chromosome 9 which is a little shorter, sorry, a little longer than it 
should be, and an abnormal chromosome 22 which is a little shorter than it 
should be. And when you look at cancer cells of CML patients you always find 
that translocation.  It's called the Philadelphia translocation because it was 
discovered by researchers in Philadelphia. 

And it's sometimes referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome.  And, again, it's 
a translocation involving chromosome 9 which has a gene called ABL which is a 
tyrosine kinase. 

And so it's a signaling protein.  And chromosome 22 which has a separate gene 
called BCR.  And, in the development of CML, breaks take place on these two 
chromosomes leading to a translocation and the formation of a new chromosome 
that has a fusion gene composed of both BCR and ABL. 

And this gives rise to a fusion protein with a piece of BCR and the kinase domain 
of ABL.  And this leads to increased proliferation, as well as increased survival of 
the cells that carry that translocation, more cells in the blood and eventually 
leukemia.  And the hope is, the hope was, as this was being worked out, actually 
important experiments done at MIT in the early 1980s here. 

As this was being worked out that maybe, because it's such a common mutation 
in this disease, if you could find an inhibitor --

-- maybe you could block the proliferation of these cells or perhaps induce their 
death.  This just gives you a little a bit, a sort of cartoon version of BCR-ABL 
signaling.  I don't want you to literally pay great attention to this. 

Suffice it to say BCR-ABL as a signaling protein stimulates many of the pathways 
that you've learned about already in this class and causes cells to proliferate, as 
well as to survive better.  So, again, can you find an inhibitor that blocks the 
activity of this enzyme and thereby blocks the proliferation of these cancer cells? 
This was undertaken by probably many drug companies in the world, but a drug 
company now called Novartis, which has its research headquarters here in 
Cambridge, succeeded. 

They generated this drug which goes by the name Gleevec.  It has a trade name, 
the name of which I can never remember, but everybody called it Gleevec when 
it was being developed.  It was also called STI571 but Gleevec is the common 
name.  They found this drug through a screen looking for small molecules that 
look a little bit like ATP, although it doesn't look much like ATP anymore, that can 
specifically bind to and block the kinase activity of this particular kinase. 

And this drug is successful.  It does bind to the kinase and blocks its kinase 
activity.  And importantly in cell lines, as well as in mouse models, it was found to 
be effective in killing CML cells.  It was then used in treatment of CML patients 
and found to be effective there, too.  So the number of white blood cells in these 
patients dropped dramatically and the number of Philadelphia chromosome 
positive cells likewise. 

So if you were to plot the number of white blood cells in a normal patient it would 
be low.  In a CML patient, in the early phase of the disease it would be down 

here, and then it would go up in the accelerated phase and then it would go up 
still further in blast crisis. 

And, as I said, this could take years, several years to progress.  And at this 
stage, late-stage disease, this person might have hundreds of thousands of white 
blood cells per mill. 

But when treated with Gleevec the white blood cell counts dropped to mere 
normal.  And amazingly the drug is extremely well-tolerated.  So even though all 
of your cells have this same ABL kinase, not fused to BCR but the same ABL 
kinase unfused, and it's probably doing stuff in your cells, those cells don't need 
it. 

But the cancer cells, in the context of this BCR-ABL fusion, are totally dependent 
on it.  And if you inhibit it now the cells will not proliferate anymore.  And, indeed, 
as you can see how precipitous this fall is, the cells will actually die, undergo 
apoptosis.  So the drug is extremely effective.  As I said, clinical tests were done. 
Sorry.  This just illustrates a cartoon version of what we've been talking about. 
Here's the BCR-ABL protein. 

Here it's in its normal state binding to ATP and transferring a phosphate to some 
substrate protein in the context of signaling.  And what Gleevec does is binds to 
the ATP pocket and blocks the access of ATP to the enzyme and, therefore, 
blocks the kinase activity.  And this is actual clinical data provided by Novartis in 
this case.  And what you're looking at here is the number of Philadelphia 
chromosome positive cells in the blood. 

And what percentage reduction you're seeing, either somewhat or completely, 
looking at the accepted therapy before Gleevec came along, which was not very 
effective, only 12% of patients showed any response, or rather a major response, 
and only 3% showed a complete response.  That is when you looked in their 
blood by PCR you could find no more Philadelphia chromosome positive cells. 

But now with Gleevec, 75% of patients showed a major response.  And 54% of 
patients showed a complete response, you could not find Philadelphia 
chromosome positive cells by PCR in the blood of these patients.  So it really 
worked extremely well. 

It gave what we call clinical remissions.  Clinical remissions.  And these patients 
survived, had, you know, dramatically extended lifetimes.  This would go on for in 
some cases as little as a half a year, in other cases up to ten years increased 
survival, especially if the patients were treated early in the disease.  But 
unfortunately for all the patients the numbers went back up. 

Clinical relapse.  An all too familiar problem in cancer therapy.  You might see 
initial treatments, they might even last a while, but too many patients undergo 

relapses where their disease comes back.  So what's going on here?  These 
patients are continuing to receive Gleevec throughout this course, and yet the 
tumors are returning. 

Why?  What might be going on?  Remember that cancer cells acquire mutations? 
Cancer cells are always acquiring mutations.  So what kind of mutation might be 
taking place in these cells that would lead them to be Gleevec resistant?  Well, 
maybe they're acquiring mutations within the BCR-ABL gene, that fusion gene, 
which blocks their ability to bind the drug. 

So Charles Sawyers, investigator at UCLA, took the cancer cells from these 
relapsed patients, PCR-ed up the BCR-ABL gene, sequenced it, and lo and 
behold he found a bunch of mutations.  Individual tumors had one or another of 
these point mutations within the ABL kinase. 

And the consequence of those mutations was that the drug Gleevec could no 
longer bind.  And that's illustrated here.  So this is, again, a cutaway view of the 
BCR-ABL kinase.  Here's Gleevec where it normally sits, but that red dot is a 
mutation that sticks an amino acid side chain right in the way of where Gleevec 
binds. 

So now it cannot bind anymore.  The drug cannot bind, it cannot be effective, 
cancer cells come back.  OK?  So that's a problem.  What are you going to do 
about it?  What can be done?  What would you do? 

Maybe we could find a drug that will bind even if there is a mutation there.  And 
that actually works and that's why this Gleevec fits nicely into that pocket and 
blocks the activity.  So this enzyme is inhibited.  The problem is that apparently 
invariably mutant BCR-ABLs arise which are Gleevec resistant. 

So you can have Gleevec around, but it cannot get in there, the enzyme still 
functions, it still causes proliferation.  But working with a different drug company, 
Charles Sawyers screened new drugs.  And he found a drug which has a similar 
but slightly different shape than Gleevec, and it's able to bind to the mutant BCR-
ABLs. 

This drug is called BMS-354825 produced by Bristol-Myers Squibb.  And just in 
December of this past year Charles Sawyers reported the first clinical trial with 
this drug in patients who had failed Gleevec therapy who had relapsed.  And 31 
out of 36 responded. 

And to my knowledge they are still in remission.  And the five who didnÃ­t respond 
had a particular kind of mutation that actually also blocked the binding of this 
drug.  But the majority of mutations, even though there are several mutations that 
will affect Gleevec resistance, the majority of them are still sensitive to this new 
drug.  So this is smart and smart again. 

Smart, understanding how cells can be sensitive.  Then smart again, finding out 
how they become resistance.  And then smart for a third time, finding new drugs 
that will bind even in the presence of those resistance mutations.  And this, I 
suspect, is the future of cancer treatments.  Understanding the molecular 
signature mutations, finding specific drugs, and then being prepared to find 
second-generation drugs that will still work even if resistance arises. 

A very similar story, which I'll have to tell you quickly, comes from the world of 
lung cancer.  In this case, several drug companies were trying to find drugs that 
would block a different tyrosine kinase.  This time a receptor tyrosine kinase by 
the name of epidermal growth factor receptor, EGF receptor. 

They were motivated to do so because this receptor is over-expressed, there is 
too much of it in many types of cancer, including lung cancer. 

And so different companies made different drugs.  One of them is called Iressa 
which goes by the trade name Gefitinib.  Another made by Genentech is called 
Tarceva.  And these do function as EGF inhibitors, anti-EGF receptor inhibitors. 
They work.  They work in the test-tube.  However, when tested in clinical trials 
they were a spectacular failure.  Even for patients who had high levels of EGF 
receptor on the surface of their cancer cells, the drug didn't do anything. 

And they were almost not going to be FDA approved for that purpose, except that 
a very small number of lung cancer patients responded extremely well to the 
drug.  about 10% of lung cancer patients showed responses like the one I'm 
showing you here, where this, and outlined in red, is a lung tumor where the 
tumor is basically filling the entire lobe of the lung. 

Six weeks after treatment with this drug Iressa, you can see massive resolution 
of the tumor.  The tumor is almost all gone, and that white stuff is probably just 
fibrotic tissue.  The tumor cells are practically gone.  A dramatic response. 
What's going on?  Why do those 10% of patients respond so well?  Well, it turns 
out that those 10% of patients carry a mutation in the EGF receptor gene. 

In those 10% of patients, one of the ways the cancer cells are growing and 
surviving is that they have a mutation that activates this gene making those 
tumor cells highly dependent on that particular protein in the same way that these 
cancers are highly dependent on BCR-ABL.  And if you deprive those cancer 
cells of that activity by using these drugs, the cells will die.  So this is a good 
example of what will come in the future of individualized medicine. 

If you're a lung cancer patient, you shouldn't just indiscriminately take Iressa 
because 95% of the time it won't do anything for you.  But if you're one of those 
10% who has a mutation in this gene, you would benefit dramatically from having 
it.  And that will happen more and more in cancer and other diseases.  Your 

tumor will be molecularly typed to find out exactly what mutations it has to find 
out which of a collection of targeted therapies you should be taking. 

These patients, just so you know, tend to be women, non-smokers, and tend to 
be Asians for reasons that we don't understand.  Any of those three we don't 
understand, but the percentage of EGFR mutant lung cancer patients are higher 
in those categories of people.  And so they have a greater likelihood of being 
responsive.  But, in fact, nowadays if you have lung cancer you get your EGFR 
gene sequenced.  And if it has a mutation you take this drug. 

And it will work.  It will resolve your tumor.  Unfortunately, your tumor will come 
back.  The same story but faster.  These patients tend only to get three months, 
six months, maybe a year, two years, three years extra survival, and then their 
tumors come back.  Same story, the receptors that are now insensitive to the 
drug carry a new mutation that blocks access of the drug to the receptor. 

Fortunately, just last month there was a paper that described a new drug that will 
still work even if the receptor carries such a resistance mutation.  So there's hope 
that we'll see a story similar to this one emerging for lung cancer.  Now, I've told 
you three of, just a handful of molecularly targeted agents for therapy in cancer. 

There are more to come.  Telomerase is an enzyme that cancer cells need, that 
normal cells or at least most normal cells don't need.  We won't go into the 
details of that, but suffice to say this is a promising area for therapy as well. 
Angiogenesis, I've mentioned to you before.  Tumors, solid tumors need a new 
blood supply.  If you can block the ability of the tumor to recruit a blood supply, 
you might be able to block the development of the tumor. 

And there has recently, Genentech once again, been an FDA approved anti-
angiogenesis drug that blocks, that prevents progression of colon cancer, and 
also they just reported breast cancer.  So anti-angiogenesis is a viable therapy 
strategy as well.  Gene therapy, putting lost genes back.  Cancer cells have 
mutations in tumor suppressor genes, p53, RB I've told you about, and others. 

Perhaps you could just put the gene back in, the gene that got lost.  Make a virus 
that expresses that gene and put it back.  This is being tried.  I'm not super 
enthusiastic about whether it will work because I don't know that we can get the 
virus carrying the good gene into all the cancer cells.  But, nevertheless, it's 
something to consider.  Immunotherapy is also a promising area.  It's possible 
that we can convince your immune system to detect the abnormal proteins that 
cancer cells make by virtue of the mutations that they carry. 

You can make antibodies or T cells that eliminate those, and that's underway. 
And I've mentioned already the cancer prevention approaches with vaccines.  I 
want to draw your attention to the fact that the Cancer Center here at MIT will 
have a symposium in June.  Many of you will have gone home for the summer, 

but some of you may not have.  June 24th.  This is free to MIT students, and 
actually features many alums of MIT.  Two of these people were undergraduates 
here at MIT, including Dan Heber, the guy who did the EGF lung cancer story 
that I just showed you. 

This is a very great group of people who will be telling you the latest and greatest 
about the new science of cancer therapy, an extension of what I've told you 
about today.  All right.  Before we finish I want to just briefly mention that in 
addition to tracking mutations in cancer-associated genes, we can also track the 
expression patterns, the levels of expression of all the genes in a cancer cell. 

And this is done using a technology called array technology where all of the 
genes of a cell, the 30,000 genes of a cell can be assessed based on how much 
RNA is being produced in those cells at any given time or at any given sample. 
This is called a GeneChip or a gene expression array.  And increasingly it's being 
used to diagnose cancers.  Cancer is typically diagnosed by histopathology. 

You look at the tumor, or the pathologist looks at the tumor in a histological 
section and says it's a this or it's a that.  The problem is that many cancers look 
very similar to the histologist or the pathologist, but in the underlying molecular 
level they might be quite different.  Some of them might be fairly benign.  Others 
might be really dangerous.  And maybe you cannot tell that apart by looking at 
the cells, but looking at the activity of the different genes inside those cells you 
may be able to get to that. 

So this is done by comparing, on a glass slide, the levels of expression of all the 
genes from the cancer cell compared to some reference RNA, let's say the 
normal cell of that tissue.  And then the signal that you read out by looking at 
labeled RNAs, the cancer cell being labeled red, for example, the normal RNA 
being labeled green, the signal that you read out from each of those spots using 
a laser and a CCD camera to detect the signal coming off of the chip, the signal 
that you see can be quantified. 

And a red signal would mean there's more RNA in sample one for that particular 
gene, a green signal more RNA for sample two, and a yellow signal roughly 
equal.  And the pattern that you get from these chips can then give you 
information about the state of those cells, and that information might be 
extremely important clinically.  And in the last two minutes I'll just tell you a brief 
story about how it is being used. 

This is a collection of 75 breast cancer specimens, early stage breast cancers, 
node negative, lymph node negative breast cancers.  These patients, before this 
technology, all would undergo removal of the tumor and then chemotherapy.  But 
it turns out that only some of them will actually go on to progress.  These patients 
were followed for ten years after that sample was taken.  And it was known that 

some of them progressed, and those fall over here, progressed in the sense that 
they developed metastatic tumors. 

And others didn't progress.  And so what was done was is to take RNA from 
these samples at this early stage, RNA from these samples and do one of these 
GeneChips and ask, is the pattern of expression of genes correlative to the 
outcome, the eventual outcome?  It might take some years for it to happen.  And 
what they found was that indeed --

And you can probably see it from where you're sitting, that this collection of 
genes in red over here is highly expressed in the guys who actually do pretty well 
and is relatively lower expressed in the guys that don't do well.  And this 
collection of genes is highly expressed in the ones who don't do well compared to 
the ones who do.  And so now there's a clinical test.  You can have your early-
stage breast cancer typed by this analysis and it will tell you with some degree of 
certainty, not complete, whether your tumor will eventually, maybe five year down 
the road progress into a metastatic tumor. 

If you get the signal, if you get the answer yes, then you have it removed and you 
undergo therapy.  If you get the answer no, you have a choice.  Perhaps you get 
the tumor removed, but you don't undergo what is in fact quite difficult and 
sometimes damaging therapy.  So this is an example of, again, stuff to come, 
molecule medicine, specific patient-oriented medicine.
