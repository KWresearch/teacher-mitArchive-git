Transcript – Lecture 9 

OK.  We are wrapping up our segment on genetics today, Genetics 4. 
We’re going to talk about human disease genetics, modes of 
inheritance for human diseased genes.  And then we’ll transition next 
time into molecular biology, which is the next blank square here.  And 
then recombinant DNA cell biology and beyond.  I wanted to start 
today by clearing up a couple of things. 

Firstly, the term F1, in the last lecture I gave you a list of terms, and I 
used this definition of the first filial generation, the F1 generation as 
the product of crosses between two homozygous individuals, 
homozygous for different alleles such that the offspring were always 
heterozygous, big A, little A at that particular gene. 

Well, it turns out that some people use the term F1 to refer to the 
offspring of any cross.  So you have the parents and you have the F1s 
regardless of the genotype of the parents.  So that’s a looser definition 
of the term F1.  And it’s been used in Section and so on, so I didn’t 
want to confuse you. 

The strict definition is the one I told you, but don’t get hung up on 
that.  We’re always going to give you the relevant genotypes so you’ll 
be able to figure out what the genotypes of the offspring are.  Also, 
near the end of the last lecture, I talked about crosses involving linked 
genes.  If you remember the Y and D gene controlling color and 
density, I think, of peas.  And I told you that they were linked, and we 
carried out a test cross.  And we then worked out what the 
percentages of the different phenotypes and genotypes would be. 

Well, in that example, I assumed that the Y allele and the D allele 
were together on the same chromosome.  But importantly if you’re 
just given the genotype as it’s written here, you actually cannot know 
that.  The big Y might be on the opposite chromosome from the big D. 
So to avoid confusion about that sort of thing, in future examples and 
in problems, problems, that is test questions, we’ll always show you 
the chromosomes so you’ll know that the genes are together on the 
same chromosome or on opposite. 

Yeah.  And in the absence of this, if the question is to tell us what the 
alleles must look like and they give you the phenotype, you have to 
conclude the genotype.  If the question is tell us what the alleles must 
look like then we’re not going to give you the answer, but in other 
situations where there’s ambiguity about what the alignment might be, 
we’ll tell you what that is. 

OK?  We also had a question from a student, actually an emailed 
question, those are also welcome, email question from a student.  It 
was good question because in our discussion of dominance and 
recessiveness, we really haven’t dealt with the molecular nature of 
that.  And that was this individual’s interest.  Why is an allele 
dominant over another one?  Why is a trait dominant over another 
one? 

And I gave an example to him, which I will give to you, which I think 
covers most of the examples that we’ve been discussing in class.  And 
it also is an opportunity for me to reinforce the notions related to 
chromosomes, genes, DNA and proteins, because apparently there are 
some of you who are still a little fuzzy on those relationships.  So let’s 
imagine a gene which is present on a chromosome.  Chromosome 
shown here.  Gene shown here.  And it’s the S gene that we’ve talked 
about before that controls smooth versus wrinkled pea texture. 

So here’s the S gene.  It’s made up of DNA.  And based on the 
sequence of that DNA within the gene, therein lies the information to 
produce a protein.  And we’re going to call this protein, in our 
example, this is a hypothetical example, the starch synthase protein. 
It’s an enzyme that controls a reaction, that catalyzes a reaction from 
some sugar substrate into some starch.  And if you make enough of 
that starch product then you have a smooth shape. 

OK?  This enzyme controls shape because it produces this product 
which is involved in the shape of a pea.  OK?  So this is the normal 
situation.  The big S allele produces a functional starch synthase 
enzyme which produces enough product to give the pea its smooth 
shape.  In this example, the little S allele, which is the recessive one, 
has a mutation within the coding sequence of the gene. 

We won’t talk about the nature of that mutation just yet, what it is, 
why it causes what it does because you’re going to get that in the next 
segment.  Just suffice to say that it’s a mutation, an alteration of the 
DNA such that the protein that’s produced from this allele is 
nonfunctional.  You might be able to see I’ve inserted a little X there. 

It’s actually quite little and invisible on your handout, but you might 
want to just circle it if you look carefully.  There’s a little X there which 
is the result of this mutation. 

And that X causes the protein to be nonfunctional.  The enzyme now 
does not catalyze the production of this starch product, so no starch 
product is produced.  If you don’t make the starch product you don’t 
have a smooth shape, you have a wrinkled shape.  OK?  If the 
genotype of the pea is little S, little S then none of this enzyme is 
produced such that none of the starch product is produced such that 
the pea is wrinkled.  OK?  Now what happens if you’re big S, little S, 
the heterozygote? 

Well, for many biochemical reactions, having just one copy of the gene 
that encodes the functional enzyme is enough.  For many biochemical 
reactions that’s true.  And so in a situation where big S is dominant 
over little S, we assume that having one copy of big S makes enough 
of the starch synthase protein to make enough of that starch product 
to give the pea its smooth shape.  OK? 

So that’s a simple example of why big S is dominant over little S, why 
you only see the phenotype associated with the little S allele, the 
wrinkled phenotype when you have two copies of the little S allele. 
OK?  So I hope that helps clarify the situation for you and actually is 
useful as we talk about human disease genes as well.  So this is a slide 
from your book which allows us to transition from concepts of 
inheritance to real-life stuff. 

Genes that regulate how your body functions normally or in response 
to various environmental stresses.  We’re now in an era where we can 
relatively easily figure out whether a disease has a genetic component 
by looking at families that might have that disease, and based on that 
information and using mapping techniques like I described to you last 
time, we can isolate where that gene might lie on all of your 
chromosomes. 

And then using molecular techniques, which we’ll talk about in future 
lectures, we can actually isolate that gene, determine its sequence, 
and based on that produce lots of various valuable things like better 
ways to diagnose the disease, better ways to understand how the 
disease process takes place such that we can then perhaps prevent the 
disease from occurring in the first place or treating it more effectively 
by replacing the gene with a new copy or producing a drug that can 
replace the gene in other ways. 

So this is what we’re after.  So we need to understand diseased genes 
and how they behave in such affected families.  So there are a number 
of diseases which have a genetic component.  And these diseases have 
various modes of inheritance. 

Some of them are autosomal dominant.  The diseased gene is 
dominant over the wild type gene, and I’ll give you examples of that. 
And the term autosomal means that it’s not sex linked.  That is the 
disease gene is carried on chromosomes 1 through 22, one of the 
those chromosomes, not on the X or the Y. 

It doesn’t matter if your father, whether the disease gene is coming 
from a male or a female, passed on to a daughter or a son.  There’s no 
sex linkage for these autosomal dominant diseases. There another 
class of genes, disease genes which follow autosomal recessive 
inheritance patterns.  Here the disease gene is recessive to wild type. 

You only see the disease phenotype when you’re homozygous for the 
mutant allele.  And, again, autosomal because it’s not sex linked. 
There are X linked diseases which are dominant.  In this case, the 
disease gene is on the X chromosome.  There are also X linked 
diseases that are recessive. 

There are very few, but for the sake of completeness, Y linked 
diseases.  But there are so few that we’re actually not going to talk 
about them at all in this class.  And, finally, there’s a class of diseases 
that we’re also not going to talk about but get inherited not from the 
genes that are in the nucleus of the cell along your chromosomes but 
rather get inherited from the mitochondria. 

And since we haven’t talked about mitochondria with you really at all 
we’re not going to expect you to know about those diseases, but just 
have in the back of your minds that those are relatively important. 
Autosomal dominant diseases are not terribly common.  There are 
about 200 known.  Autosomal recessive diseases are actually much 
more common, though not very frequent in the population. 

There are about 2,000 of these known.  And together I would estimate 
there are about 25 sex linked diseases.  So we’ve used the term 
autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, sex linked.  What does this 
really look like in terms of the genes and the alleles? 

Well, just as in the case of peas, a dominant disease allele will cause 
disease regardless of the nature of the other allele.  It’s dominant over 
the normal common version of the gene.  So if we call this allele the 
disease allele of some gene --

-- and this allele the commonly found on in the population, and we 
refer to these often as the wild type --

-- in an individual who has this genotype for a dominant disease gene, 
will they develop disease?  Yes, because the disease allele is dominant 
over the normal copy of the gene.  So these individuals will develop 
disease. 

For recessive disease alleles you need to have both copies, both alleles 
be mutant in order to manifest the disease.  So here’s another gene, 
which we’ll call the H gene, which has a disease allele.  This individual 
is homozygous for the disease allele.  Will this individual develop 
disease? 

There might be other people in the population who are heterozygous 
for that allele and have a wild type allele on the other chromosome. 
Will they develop disease?  No.  These individuals are called 
heterozygous carriers. 

They carry the disease allele, but because they also carry a wild type 
allele they don’t develop the disease.  They’re normal. 

They’re normal in the sense of their phenotype.  They have an 
abnormal genotype in the sense that they have a disease allele, but 
they’re normal in the sense of their genotype, phenotype.  Now, for X 
linked genes, sorry, before I do that let me --

Let me review for you sex determination.  We talked about this briefly. 
In order to understand the inheritance pattern for X linked genes you 
need to remember this.  That males of course have one X chromosome 
and one Y chromosome.  Females have two X chromosomes. 

If you think of a Punnett Square related to the inheritance of 
chromosomes males will pass along an X or a Y at 50% each, females 
will pass along one of their two Xs. 

Will produce an equal number of males and females from such crosses. 
But it’s important to think about where the X chromosomes come 
from, specifically males and the Y chromosomes. 

Males transmit their only Y, their only Y to all of their sons.  If you’re 
the son then you’ve gotten your father’s only Y.  Males transmit their 
only X chromosome to all of their daughters. 

If you’re the daughter, when you’re the daughter of a male, you have 
inherited his X chromosome.  OK? 

Females transmit either X to each daughter or son.  In the case of the 
female X, you can be a male who got this X chromosome or a male 
who got this X chromosome.  You can be a female who got this X 
chromosome or a female who got this X chromosome.  And that’s 
important for understanding the disease genetics. 

So let’s imagine a dominant disease involving the X chromosome. 

A gene, we’ll call it Q.  Males only have one X chromosome. They only 
have one X chromosome, therefore if they carry the disease gene 
they’re going to get disease. 

Females have two X chromosomes.  They might carry the disease 
allele on one but a normal copy on the other.  In this scenario, will 
they develop disease?  Yes, because it’s a dominant disease allele. 

For recessive X linked disease, once again, males only have one X. 
Are they going to get disease?  Yes.  Females have two X 
chromosomes.  If they carry a disease allele on one they are likely to 
carry a wild type copy on the other.  Are they going to get disease? 
No.  They’re going to be heterozygous carriers. 

And you’ll see how this plays out towards the end of the lecture. 

OK.  So let’s look at some examples.  We’re going to start with 
recessive diseases first, recessive autosomal diseases first. 

And one you’ve already seen before, and that’s PKU, phenylketonuria. 
If you recall, this is a disease which is associated with failure to make 
an enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine.  It’s an enzyme 
called phenylalanine hydroxylase.  If you don’t have that enzyme then 
you produce too much of this byproduct, phenylpyruvic acid which is 
toxic and leads to brain damage and retardation. 

This can be avoided, the disease can be avoided by limiting your 
amount of dietary phenylalanine.  And that’s why such patients are not 

supposed to have Equal, as we discussed before.  The disease, PKU, is 
autosomal recessive.  The incidence is rare, about one in 10,000 to 
15,000 individuals have PKU.  As I talked to you about last time, the 
mutant allele has a single amino acid chain change in the active site of 
this enzyme which changes an arginine residue to a tryptophan 
residue. 

And that makes the enzyme inactive.  This is an autosomal recessive 
disease.  So if you have one mutant allele and one normal copy of the 
phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, do you have the disease?  No.  You 
would be a carrier but you would not have the disease symptoms. 
Because again, as in the other hypothetical example, most of the time, 
if you have a single normal copy of an enzyme that carries out some 
biochemical reaction that’s enough and your phenotype is normal. 

Here’s another common example, cystic fibrosis.  This is actually a 
more common disease.  It affects about one in 2,000 to 3,000 
individuals.  That’s not an insignificant number.  So there are a lot of 
people with cystic fibrosis in this country.  Again, it’s autosomal 
recessive.  Patients present with the disease at birth. 

They have problems both in their intestinal system as well as in their 
lungs.  It tends to be the lung symptoms that ultimately kills the 
patient due to inability to breathe properly, but actually more 
importantly persistent infections which ultimately are so severe that 
they lead to death.  And these patients tend to die within the first two 
to three decades of life.  The gene encoded by the disease, the gene 
responsible for this disease is a chloride channel. 

When it functions properly it allows chloride ions to move through, and 
this achieves a proper water balance inside the cells.  When the 
disease allele is present in both copies, this channel is not formed 
properly, and therefore the water balance in such cells is not correct 
and it leads to the build up of this kind of mucousy sticky substance 
both in the lungs and in the intestines.  These individuals, as you can 
see, have a very hard time breathing, and they have to get this 
mucous cleared from their lungs periodically. 

And they also often have to have respirators to allow them to breath. 
OK.  So that’s some examples of autosomal recessive diseases.  Let’s 
think about the genetics.  And we’ll talk about CF specifically.  Let’s 
imagine the disease allele of CF.  We’ll call it CFD.  There are actually 
many different disease alleles for this disease, but we’ll just lump them 
together. 

Here are two individuals with this genotype.  Do these individuals 
manifest the disease?  Yes or no?  Do they manifest the disease?  No, 
because this is an autosomal recessive disease and they have a wild 
type copy. 

But if we think about the offspring that they could produce, this 
individual will produce gametes that carry the D allele and the wild 
type allele, likewise this individual, the D allele and the wild type allele, 
such that the offspring will either be DD, wild type D, wild type, wild 
type or wild type, D.  Right? 

So you’ll have one wild type, wild type individual produced out of such 
a cross.  And this individual now has no disease allele present.  This 
individual is both genotypically and phenotypically normal.  No more 
issues about cystic fibrosis for this person or his or her descendants. 
There will be two individuals who are heterozygous, and these 
individuals are carriers. 

They don’t have the disease but they do have a mutant allele.  So 
depending on whom they marry, I shouldn’t generalize, depending on 
whom they have children with they may or may not have to worry 
about the fact that they have a mutant CF allele.  And one, on 
average, out of four will have two disease alleles and develop CF.  OK? 

So we’re going to now think about these diseases in inheritance 
looking at pedigrees, which I think are probably familiar to most of 
you.  They’re described in your book as well.  But I just want to make 
sure you understand what the symbols mean before we get into it. 
Females are represented as circles.  Males are represented as squares. 
Seems appropriate. 

Lines between them represent a mating, they have mated.  And the 
offspring are represented below. 

If the symbol is left open then the individual is normal, genotypically 
and phenotypically.  If the individual has a shaded symbol they are 
affected, they show disease symptoms.  And if the symbol is partially 
shaded, I usually fill in half the symbol, the book will sometimes put a 
little circle inside the circle then they are carriers.  They’re 
heterozygous carriers. 

OK?  So let’s look and think about this example up here.  We talked 
about two individuals who were both heterozygous for the disease 
allele, so they were carriers.  Their genotype was CFD, CF wild type. 

They mated.  They had four children. 

There were four possible genotypes, rather three possible genotypes. 
And, in fact, we observe all three genotypes in this generation. We 
have one individual over here who doesn’t have her symbol filled.  We 
have another whose symbol is fully filled. 

And then we have two whose symbols are partially filled.  What’s the 
genotype of this individual?  Wild type, wild type.  This one?  D, D. 
This one?  D, wild type.  And this one?  Same thing.  OK?  So that’s 
what pedigrees look like. 

Let me show you a larger pedigree and give you some of the rules that 
apply to autosomal recessive diseases.  So here’s a large pedigree 
involving an autosomal recessive gene, disease gene.  Again, the two 
parents are heterozygous.  They had many, many offspring all here. 
Roughly a quarter of them will carry both copies of the disease gene 
and develop disease. 

Among the rest there will be unaffected individuals but of two classes, 
ones that don’t have the disease gene at all and ones who are 
heterozygous carriers.  Two-thirds of those unaffected offspring are 
themselves carriers, two-thirds.  Two-thirds of the unaffected offspring 
are themselves carriers. 

Among those half of the offspring of a carrier are themselves carriers, 
as shown here.  So if this individual came to you at a genetics clinic 
and wanted to know what is my likelihood of carrying the D mutant 
allele, you’d be able to say, without knowing the genotype of his 
mother you would be able to say that it’s half of a half or a quarter. 
OK? 

Now, every once in a while two affected individuals, two homozygotes 
have children, as shown here.  And you can see in that scenario all of 
the offspring have disease because the only alleles that are present 
are the mutant alleles.  That has to be true because these are both 
affected, and therefore all of the offspring will also only inherit mutant 
alleles and develop the disease themselves.  OK? 

And importantly because the disease gene is coming in on 
chromosomes 1 to 22, one of those and not the X or the Y, there is no 
gender associations here.  Mothers can pass the disease to their 
daughters and their sons.  Fathers can pass the disease to their 
daughters and their sons.  There are no gender associations with this 
scenario. 

OK.  Disease alleles are present in different frequencies in the 
population.  Some of them are extremely rare, but some of them are 
actually rather common. 

So we’re talking about the allele frequency, the percentage of alleles 
among all of our chromosomes that are the disease type.  For PKU it 
depends a lot on where you’re from. 

For example, in Turkey it’s actually rather common, one in 206,000 
alleles of this gene are mutant in this population, but in Japan it’s 
much less common.  One in 220,000 Japanese carry this allele. 

Exactly why this is we’re not entirely sure, although I’ll give you some 
speculation in a little while about what controls the frequency of these 
actually rather deleterious alleles.  CF is fairly frequent.  One in 25 
alleles are CF.  One in 25.  There are as maybe 200 of you in this 
room, so that’s some number of mutant alleles among you.  It’s a 
fairly high number. 

You’re sitting there carrying a mutant copy of the CF allele.  This is 
actually relevant to European descendancy.  I’m not entirely sure 
whether it applies to all descendencies but let’s just say that it’s 
roughly that number.  And another disease that you might have heard 
of Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population --

-- is also quite common.  One in 25. It’s so common, in fact, that in 
certain parts of the world individuals undergo genetic testing before 
they decide whom to date because they want to avoid the risk that 
they’re going to date somebody else who carries such a mutation. 

This is actually a very horrible disease.  I shouldn’t joke about it.  So 
they want to avoid ever having to face the problem of having a child 
who has Tay-Sachs disease.  So they undergo, in a sense, pre-
marriage counseling to figure out their genotype to decide whether or 
not to date.  And you can also imagine with similar tests we could 
figure out whether or not individuals carry mutations in these genes to 
let them know what their risks of developing disease are or whether or 

not to maintain a pregnancy of a child who may or may not be affected 
and so on. 

So they’re very serious societal implications for these kinds of disease 
alleles.  Now, some of the alleles are very rare.  Here’s one example in 
the Japanese population of PKU.  The likelihood that two individuals 
would randomly get together who had mutant alleles of a 
phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and have a child is exceedingly small. 

And so in these situations, where the allele frequency is extremely 
rare, when you find an affected individual it’s almost always a sure 
sign of inbreeding.  Consanguinity is the term used in genetics where 
cousins or other relatives marry and have children.  And since they are 
related and have a higher allele frequency within their families of a 
particular allele then the likelihood that they’ll have an offspring who 
has two copies of the allele is much higher. 

And so when you see a pattern such as this, it’s a fairly clear indication 
that you’re dealing with an autosomal recessive disease involving 
consanguineous mating.  Here are two cousins who are producing 
offspring both of whom are affected.  And when you see a pattern like 
this you can actually figure out, or at least figure out pretty well who 
were the carriers in this scenario, who were the carriers in this family. 

Since both, since the children have two mutant copies then both of 
their parents must be heterozygous carriers.  OK?  That goes without 
saying.  They’re heterozygous.  Since this individual is heterozygous 
and the allele was passed on from their grandparents then his mother 
must also carry the allele inherited from one of the two grandparents. 

Likewise this woman’s father must carry the mutant allele.  And in this 
generation we actually don’t know whether it’s the male or the female 
who carries the mutation.  It could be either.  And it’s been passed 
along to both sides of this family tree and reduced to homozygocity in 
this generation.  OK?  You can also begin to figure out what the 
likelihood of other members of the family tree is being heterozygous. 

So this individual here has a one in two chance. One of these two 
parents is definitely a heterozygote, and so the likelihood that he’s a 
heterozygote is one in two.  And among his children you could say 
they have a one in four chance.  If he has a one in two chance then 
there’s a one in two chance that he’ll pass it onto them, so overall 
there’s a one in four chance that they will be themselves carriers. 

And this, again, this kind of genetic testing is done frequently to figure 
out what your relative risk of developing a particular disease are. 
Now, as I said, for other disease alleles like CF and Tay-Sachs, the 
allele frequency is actually strikingly high.  And yet if you’re 
homozygous for these mutations you’re dead.  Not necessarily right 
away but not for very long.  It clearly reduces your reproductive 
fitness. 

And so why would these alleles be present in our population at all? 
Why wouldn’t they be removed through natural selection?  We’re not 
going to get into this in great detail, but there are theories out there 
and some evidence to support them that there might be actually an 
advantage in certain circumstances for being heterozygous wild type 
over mutant.  And there are theories both related to Tay-Sachs 
disease, sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis such that if you are 
heterozygous you actually survive better in the face of certain 
pathogenic exposure than do people who are wild type for both alleles. 

And that’s the argument for why these alleles actually built up, at least 
in the past, over the evolution of our species.  OK.  Let’s transition 
now to autosomal dominant diseases.  This is a famous example, 
Huntington’s disease, otherwise called Huntington’s chorea. 

Relatively rare.  About one in 10,000 to 25,000 individuals affected. It 
exhibits an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, as you’ll see in 
a moment.  The age of onset is about 35 to 40 years of age.  These 
individuals actually are totally normal for the first three to four 
decades.  You wouldn’t know that they had a disease.  But starting at 
that time they begin to develop symptoms which involve both effects 
on their personalities but more importantly effects on their 
movements. 

That’s what you first begin to see.  That’s what chorea means.  It’s 
sort of this dance-like movement.  And then that gets much, much 
more severe and stereotypical.  And eventually, in addition to that, 
there’s death of cells in the brain.  And the combination of these 
affects leads to the death of the individual by about the fourth or fifth 
decade of life.  This is actually a movie of an individual who has 
Huntington’s disease. 

He’s being told to hold his arms straight out, but because of this 
neurogenerative process that’s taking place within his brain and also 
other parts of his nervous system he’s unable to do so.  And this is 
sort of the stereotypical presentation of Huntington’s chorea.  They 

have this wave-like movement and also their limbs get stuck in 
particular postures, as you can see this individual here. 

At the molecular level the problem in these individuals is that their 
brain cells are dying, particular ones, actually, within a particular 
region of the brain surrounding this ventricle here.  And this is a 
normal space in a normal brain.  And there are various sets of neurons 
on either side of those ventricles.  And in HD patients those cells are 
progressively lost over time, and when those cells are lost you lose 
motor control and you also develop rather severe dementia. 

And the reason that those cells are being lost is that the mutant 
protein, the mutant form of this protein called Huntington, the mutant 
form builds up inside of those cells and aggregates and causes the 
cells to die.  OK?  And this is why this is an autosomal dominant 
disease.  If you have the disease allele then you will get the 
aggregation of the protein and you will develop the disease. 

So let’s take another example of a cross between an individual who is 
normal, two normal copies of HD and an individual who has a disease 
allele and a wild type allele who is heterozygous.  Is this individual 
diseased? 

He either is already or he will be in the case of HD.  It’s an autosomal 
dominant disease.  If you have the disease allele you will develop 
disease.  If we look at a Punnett Square, this individual will always 
transmit the wild type allele, this individual will transmit the mutant 
allele half the time the wild type allele of the other.  These individuals 
will be wild type D, wild type D, wild type, wild type, wild type, wild 
type. 

So you’ll get half diseased, half normal.  OK?  A rather different picture 
than we saw previously.  And importantly, as I mentioned, the 
presence, the mere presence of the D allele leads to the production of 
this toxic protein. 

And ultimately brain damage.  And that’s why it’s dominant.  OK.  So 
let’s look at a pedigree of an autosomal dominant disorder.  Here’s an 
affected individual, a female who marries, who has children with an 
unaffected male. 

They have four children.  On average half of them will inherit the 
defective allele and therefore develop disease.  Half of the offspring of 
an affected parent will be affected.  Importantly, the unaffected 

offspring of an affected parent have unaffected offspring.  If you are 
normal, you do not inherit the disease allele, you’re scot-free. Your 
children will no longer have to worry about this disease. 

But in this case, in this individual, again roughly half, in this example 
two-thirds of the offspring do develop the disease.  This is another 
really important case of genetic testing.  This guy might have wanted 
to know that he was going to develop Huntington’s disease in order to 
decide whether to have children in the first place.  This individual here 
likewise might want to know before the disease actually manifested 
itself what would happen in order to make lifestyle decisions. 

Am I going to quit work and have a good time for the next ten years? 
Because pretty soon I’m actually not going to be able to.  So genetic 
testing actually can make an extremely important set of decisions for 
individuals affected in this way.  And there’s actually a subtlety here, 
too.  Sometimes people don’t want to know because there’s actually 
nothing to be done for them.  In the case of Huntington’s disease 
that’s true.  We don’t have a cure for it. 

So Arlo Guthrie who is the son of Woody Guthrie, who died of 
Huntington’s disease, apparently doesn’t want to know because if he 
learns that he’s going to get it he’s just going to be depressed.  If he 
learns that he didn’t get it he might be relieved, but he doesn’t want to 
take that chance so he’s just leading life in hopes that he doesn’t have 
the disease allele.  Now, I actually don’t know in his case whether he 
has children or not.  He has children, so he actually made that decision 
almost for his children as well. 

So important implications for these kinds of genetic diseases.  Now, 
here’s an interesting pattern that I want to share with you.  And this 
relates to a phenomenon called penetrance. 

Penetrance.  Penetrance is a number which reflects the percentage of 
individuals who have the disease genotype who end up getting the 
disease.  I’ve been telling you about examples where that’s 100%.  If 
you have the disease genotype you get the disease.  But that’s not 
always true.  Sometimes you can have the disease genotype, but 
because of other factors like environmental factors, what you eat, 
what you get exposed to you actually don’t develop the disease. 

Or maybe you just got lucky because some of these diseases are 
stochastic in nature.  And you might have been one of the lucky ones. 
That would be an example of lack of penetrance.  You have the disease 

genotype but you don’t have the disease itself.  And this can lead to 
the development of individuals in pedigrees, such as the one I’m going 
to show you, who are obligate carriers, obligate carriers. 

We call them obligate carriers because they have a child who is 
affected but they themselves were not affected.  And they have a 
parent who likewise was affected.  So the simplest explanation for a 
pedigree such as this is that this mother passed along the disease 
allele to her daughter but she did not manifest the disease, an 
example of lack of penetrance, but she still had the disease allele 
which she passed onto her daughter who developed disease. 

OK?  And we call these individuals obligate carriers.  Even though they 
don’t manifest the disease they must be carriers.  And in that sense 
this circle should be shaded.  We haven’t shaded it because actually 
there are other explanations for how you can get this pattern. 
Sometimes, for example, the disease is such that there are non-
familial forms of the disease which complicate the analysis.  Heart 
disease is a good example.  There are familial forms of heart disease 
and there is sporadic heart disease. 

Maybe this woman doesn’t have the predisposing mutation and her 
daughter just developed heart disease.  That can happen.  Another 
example is that maybe she picked up a new mutation.  Her mother is 
actually clean but she picked up her own mutation in the development 
of the sperm or egg that gave rise to her, and then she has the 
disease.  That would be rare but not unprecedented. 

And the final example, which is the most interesting, is so-called non-
paternity or even non-maternity.  So we’re making an assumption 
here based on what the family has provided us in terms of this 
pedigree that this girl is the daughter of this mating, this woman and 
this man.  But about 10% of kids born in this country actually have a 
father who isn’t their father.  It’s a shocking statistic, I know, but it’s 
true.  This is called non-paternity. 

So it might be the case that this woman actually doesn’t have the 
mutation.  It’s just that her father, her mate, the father of this girl 
[LAUGHTER] is not that guy.  And this is sick but true, most often in 
situations like this it’s Uncle Bob or brother Steve. I know it’s 
disgusting but this is often an example, the explanation for examples 
such as this. 

And another interesting example is non-maternity.  We’re assuming 
that this is the mother of this child but sometimes families don’t want 
to admit, for example, that this girl had a baby.  And so they give it to 
Aunt Sue.  And now Aunt Sue’s child gets the disease, but it’s not 
because of Aunt Sue’s genes. It’s because of her cousin.  OK?  So here 
are some examples. 

Now, I have one more minute, and I need to riffle through the slides 
because I’m going to leave you for a few days.  And I want to just 
remind you that there are X linked diseases that affect, that are both 
dominant and recessive.  Most of them are recessive.  And here’s a 
classic example, an X linked recessive disease involving hemophilia in 
the royal families of Europe.  Importantly, when you look at X linked 
disease pedigrees, and here’s Duchenne muscular dystrophy, another 
familiar disease, again X linked recessive, there are certain rules that 
dictate the development of the disease over the generations. 

They’re summarized here.  And you should look in your book for more 
information.  And, finally, there are rare examples of X linked 
dominant diseases, and their rules of inheritance are somewhat 
different.  So you should familiarize yourself with X linked modes of 
inheritance.
