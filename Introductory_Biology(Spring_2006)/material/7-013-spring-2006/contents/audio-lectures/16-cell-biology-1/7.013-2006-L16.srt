1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
OK.  I think we'll get started.
We're moving into another phase of

2
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24
the course today talking about cell
biology.  There are going to be

3
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
three lectures on cell biology
covering a variety of topics.

4
00:00:29 --> 00:00:41
So we've been talking about cells in

5
00:00:41 --> 00:00:46
various contexts over the course of
several lectures,

6
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
actually, but more or less we've
talked about them as static objects

7
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
that carry out replication and
transcription and translation and so

8
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
on and so forth.
But, in fact, as I'm sure you are

9
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
aware, cells are highly dynamic
structures which do many things at

10
00:01:05 --> 00:01:10
all times.  And this is a movie from
which shows the movement of cells.

11
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
Cells will move randomly when you
place them in a dish,

12
00:01:14 --> 00:01:19
but they'll also move in a directed
fashion in response to factors in

13
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
their environment that attract them
or they'll move away from factors

14
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
that repel them.
So cell movement is an example of a

15
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
dynamic process.
Cells in the immune system,

16
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
for example, are cells that do a lot
of very critical movement to get to

17
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
the site of a wound,
to get to the site of an infection,

18
00:01:41 --> 00:01:45
and then to elicit the proper
response to that infection.

19
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
It's a late arriving crowd today.
Another aspect of the dynamic

20
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
nature of cells is the fact that
they divide.  And I've actually

21
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
shown you this movie previously.
From early embryogenesis through the

22
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
formation of the fully formed
organism and then throughout adult

23
00:02:02 --> 00:02:06
life, cells are receiving signals to
divide at the appropriate times and

24
00:02:06 --> 00:02:11
to stop dividing when it's not
longer necessary.

25
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
This is a process of signal
transduction, receipt of a signal

26
00:02:16 --> 00:02:21
which tells the cell it's time to do
something, and then to process that

27
00:02:21 --> 00:02:26
signal in a way to leads to the
proper cellular response.

28
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
Maybe one of the most well
understood or familiar examples of

29
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
this process of signal transduction
is the neuron depicted here in its

30
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
actual state filled with a dye so
you can see its various processes

31
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
and diagramed here.
Neurons, of course,

32
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
are part of the information transfer
in the nervous system where signals

33
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
are received from these structures
here called dendrites.

34
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
That signal is then propagated
through the body of the neuron

35
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
through these long structures called
axons and then released.

36
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
The signal finally acts upon the
structures at the very end of these

37
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
nerve terminals leading to the
release, for example,

38
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
of neurotransmitters.  These are
impressive cells for a variety of

39
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
reasons.  And Professor Sive will
actually give you some lectures

40
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
which deal more specifically about
signaling in the nervous system.

41
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
One of the ways that they're
impressive is their sheer length.

42
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
You have neurons in your body that
are more than a meter in length,

43
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
and whales have neurons in their
body that are tens of

44
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
meters in length.
So these are remarkable cells which

45
00:03:31 --> 00:03:36
carry out very specific functions.
So basically what we want to talk

46
00:03:36 --> 00:03:42
about over the course of today's
lecture, we'll get there eventually,

47
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
we have to do some other stuff first,
is the process by which cells

48
00:03:47 --> 00:03:56
respond to a stimulus.

49
00:03:56 --> 00:04:01
And then, much as a computer would
do, to process that signal in very

50
00:04:01 --> 00:04:07
sophisticated ways,
which I'll introduce to you this

51
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
time and talk about in greater
detail next time as well,

52
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
to lead to a particular cellular
response.  And I've given you three

53
00:04:19 --> 00:04:25
examples of cellular responses in
the movies and images this morning.

54
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
For example, the cells might respond
by moving in a particular directed

55
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
fashion.  They might divide because
it's time for them to divide.

56
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
Or they might, in response to this
signal, release a neurotransmitter

57
00:04:37 --> 00:04:47
--

58
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
In the peripheral nervous system or
in the brain.  So what we want to

59
00:04:51 --> 00:04:56
understand is what does this really
mean?  What are the mechanisms that

60
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
cells use to process signals?
And you'll actually see analogies

61
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
to integrated circuits as we go
through some examples.

62
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
Before we get there,
we need to understand a little bit

63
00:05:10 --> 00:05:15
about how cells are built.
Largely, but not entirely,

64
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
the structure of a cell is related
to its function.

65
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
So neurons are an example.
Their particular structures allow

66
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
them to do the things
that they do.

67
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
Erythrocytes are another example.
Small red blood cells, which are

68
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
oxygen-carrying cells,
are built the way they're built to

69
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
do what they need to do.
And largely, but not entirely,

70
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
a cell's structure is determined by
what proteins are expressed.

71
00:05:46 --> 00:05:54
And also where those proteins are

72
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
found inside the cell.
Where those proteins are localized

73
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
inside the cell.
So I want to spend a little bit of

74
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
time talking about protein
localization.

75
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
So I want to spend a little bit of
time talking about protein

76
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
localization, how is it that
proteins within your cells get to

77
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
where they're going,
in a sense know where they're

78
00:06:13 --> 00:06:22
supposed to go.

79
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
And a critical tool for
understanding this process of

80
00:06:26 --> 00:06:35
protein localization --

81
00:06:35 --> 00:06:45
-- is fluorescence imaging.

82
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
And so I think you're all aware of
standard light microscopy where you

83
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
pass white light through a sample,
let's say a cell or a collection of

84
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
cells, and based on the absorbance
of the light through the different

85
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
structures within those cells you're
actually able to visualize what the

86
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
cells look like.
With fluorescence microscopy,

87
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
what you do is shine UV light onto
the cell, which brings energy to the

88
00:07:08 --> 00:07:13
cell and allows molecules that will
fluoresce in response to that

89
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
wavelength of UV to be visualized.
So if you have a fluorescent signal

90
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
within the cell,
you can see where that signal is

91
00:07:22 --> 00:07:27
coming from using fluorescence
microscopy or fluorescence

92
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
imaging.
So how is it that we get

93
00:07:32 --> 00:07:37
fluorescence from the particular
structures, proteins or other things

94
00:07:37 --> 00:07:42
that we want to see inside the cell?
Well, there are two general ways of

95
00:07:42 --> 00:07:47
doing that.  The first is
fluorescent antibodies.

96
00:07:47 --> 00:07:57
So let's imagine we have a protein

97
00:07:57 --> 00:08:03
of interest.  We want to know where
it is inside the cell.

98
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
And we're able to make that protein,
say, in bacteria.

99
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
We can inject that protein into a
bunny, that's a bunny,

100
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
or into a mouse, that's a mouse.
OK.  These are the common organisms

101
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
used for production of antibodies.
We'll actually talk about how

102
00:08:24 --> 00:08:30
antibodies are made and how they
recognize the things they recognize

103
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
in subsequent lectures.
But I think you all know that

104
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
antibodies are made by the body to
recognize foreign stuff.

105
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
In this case, this protein that
we've produced is foreign to the

106
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
bunny or to the mouse.
And so in response to that it makes

107
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
an antibody, or a series of
antibodies.  These are proteins

108
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
which have a particular structure
that we often diagram like this.

109
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
They have four chains, two big ones
and two little ones.  So

110
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
these are antibodies.
And importantly the antibodies are

111
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
specific.  That is they will bind to
this protein but they won't bind to

112
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
other proteins.
So they specifically recognize this

113
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
protein which is called the antigen
in the context of antibodies.

114
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
We can purify these antibodies and
then chemically modify them to add a

115
00:09:18 --> 00:09:36
fluorochrome.

116
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
A chemical moiety that will
fluoresce in response to a

117
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
particular UV wavelength of light.
We can then apply those

118
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
fluorescently labeled antibodies to
cells that we've put onto a glass

119
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
slide and actually poked holes in to
allow the antibody to access the

120
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
inside of the cell.
And then we can visualize where the

121
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
fluorescence comes from within the
cell using fluorescence

122
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
imaging microscopy.
So, for example,

123
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
if the protein of interest is in the
nucleus, and we have labeled our

124
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
antibody with a fluorochrome that
fluoresces in the green wavelength,

125
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
now when we visualize this cell by
fluorescence microscopy the nucleus,

126
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
if the protein is nuclear, will look
green.  OK?  And this has been used

127
00:10:15 --> 00:10:20
in cell biology for a very long time,
and it's still used today.

128
00:10:20 --> 00:10:25
It's a very powerful method for
determining protein localization.

129
00:10:25 --> 00:10:30
This method is called
immunofluorescence.

130
00:10:30 --> 00:10:40
Immuno for the antibody and

131
00:10:40 --> 00:10:45
fluorescence.  And you can actually
use multiple antibodies labeled with

132
00:10:45 --> 00:10:50
different colored fluorochromes and
find multiple proteins in relation

133
00:10:50 --> 00:10:55
to one another.
So that's one method.

134
00:10:55 --> 00:11:00
To an extent, this method has been
replaced by a new method which

135
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05
relies on the fact that there are
naturally fluorescent molecules.

136
00:11:05 --> 00:11:11
Naturally fluorescent proteins,

137
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
I should say.  You've actually all
seen these.  If you go to the beach,

138
00:11:16 --> 00:11:21
you might have encountered jelly
fish which fluoresce.

139
00:11:21 --> 00:11:26
And they fluoresce because they
make a protein which itself

140
00:11:26 --> 00:11:32
fluoresces when activated by the
proper UV wavelength.

141
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
These proteins have been isolated
from these species,

142
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
cloned into plasmids,
and then used in recombinant DNA

143
00:11:40 --> 00:11:44
techniques, like I told you about
before, to visualize where other

144
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48
proteins go inside the cell.
And I'll give you some examples of

145
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
that in a minute.
But here's the jelly fish naturally.

146
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
Here are these structures.
The jelly fish actually makes a

147
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
light which then causes these
protein bundles to fluoresce green.

148
00:12:00 --> 00:12:05
The gene was cloned,
as I said.  It was given the name

149
00:12:05 --> 00:12:21
GFP for green fluorescence protein.

150
00:12:21 --> 00:12:25
And a cDNA copy of the mRNA is used
in molecular biology all over the

151
00:12:25 --> 00:12:30
place to do an experiment like this.
And I'll take you through an

152
00:12:30 --> 00:12:35
example of another one like this in
a moment where you can actually fuse

153
00:12:35 --> 00:12:40
your gene of interest,
gene X, cDNA corresponding to that

154
00:12:40 --> 00:12:45
gene with the GFP cDNA to make a
fusion protein that has your gene of

155
00:12:45 --> 00:12:50
interest, plus GFP as one
long polypeptide.

156
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
And now this protein will fluoresce.
And you'll be able to visualize it.

157
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
And, again, I'll give you an
example of how that's done in a

158
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
moment.  We've also used this,
we, the field has used this to make

159
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
organisms, other organisms
which fluoresce.

160
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
In my lab, for example,
we've mad green mice which express

161
00:13:07 --> 00:13:12
the GFP protein in the cells of the
skin of the mouse.

162
00:13:12 --> 00:13:17
So if you shine UV light on the
mouse it turns green.

163
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
It's kind of cool.  And others have
made pets that fluoresce.

164
00:13:22 --> 00:13:27
Surprising, but true, you can
actually buy a fluorescent rabbit.

165
00:13:27 --> 00:13:32
I'm not sure who sells them, but
they are available commercially.

166
00:13:32 --> 00:13:36
And I decided to show you a picture
of one, of a rabbit called Alba the

167
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
fluorescent bunny,
which should be showing here.

168
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
But Alba is actually a little bit
shy so she doesn't always come.

169
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
Alba the fluorescent bunny.  Oh,
here she comes.  So this is actually

170
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
a fluorescent rabbit which was made
by introducing this GFP gene into

171
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
the cells of the skin,
such that it expressed in the cells

172
00:13:56 --> 00:14:02
of the skin of the rabbit.
So it's a very powerful technique,

173
00:14:02 --> 00:14:08
but let me give you a few more
examples of how it might be useful.

174
00:14:08 --> 00:14:15
I know.  Everybody now wants one.
So if you have a cDNA for GFP,

175
00:14:15 --> 00:14:21
and actually there are clever
molecular engineers who have

176
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
modified this gene GFP to produce
fluorescent proteins that fluoresce

177
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
in the red wavelength.
So they're RFP,

178
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
red fluorescent proteins.
There are yellow fluorescent

179
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
proteins.  There are blue called
scion CFP fluorescent proteins.

180
00:14:41 --> 00:14:46
So there's a whole kit, a whole
coloring box, if you will,

181
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
of different color fluorescent
proteins that you can play with.

182
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
You can then add that, in
techniques that you are familiar

183
00:14:54 --> 00:14:59
with, to a cDNA of your
gene of interest.

184
00:14:59 --> 00:15:07
So this is a cDNA of your gene of

185
00:15:07 --> 00:15:13
interest.  If you now combine those
using recombinant DNA techniques

186
00:15:13 --> 00:15:20
that we told you about in previous
lectures, you could make a plasmid

187
00:15:20 --> 00:15:26
which has GFP fused directly in
frame, to make a long open reading

188
00:15:26 --> 00:15:33
frame with your gene of interest.
OK?  And in that plasmid you would

189
00:15:33 --> 00:15:39
also include a promoter to allow the
expression of this fusion.

190
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
And it's also necessary to have,
at the other end, a polyadenylation

191
00:15:45 --> 00:15:51
sequence, again,
to insure proper expression of this

192
00:15:51 --> 00:15:57
fusion protein in the cells.
And this would then be housed

193
00:15:57 --> 00:16:02
inside of a plasmid vector.  OK?
We could then transfect,

194
00:16:02 --> 00:16:07
introduce, using methods similar to
transformation,

195
00:16:07 --> 00:16:12
but now not into bacteria.
Instead into mammalian cells.

196
00:16:12 --> 00:16:18
We could introduce this plasmid
into cells in culture so that in the

197
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
nucleus of these cells that I've
modified, I now have this new gene

198
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
present which can express a green
fusion protein with my

199
00:16:28 --> 00:16:33
gene of interest.
Now, importantly,

200
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
the goal of this experiment is to
understand where the protein that's

201
00:16:37 --> 00:16:41
encoded by my gene of interest is
localized.  And the way that I'm

202
00:16:41 --> 00:16:45
going to do that is to follow where
the green color goes.

203
00:16:45 --> 00:16:49
If it's a cytoplasmic protein the
green will be in the cytoplasm.

204
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
If it's a nuclear protein the green
will be in the nucleus and so on.

205
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
So if I now look at this cell by
fluorescence microscopy,

206
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
I will see the green signal in the
nucleus.

207
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
OK?  It's a very,
very powerful technique that allows

208
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10
us to follow the products of genes
of interest wherever they might go

209
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14
inside of cells.
And I just made a collection of

210
00:17:14 --> 00:17:19
images from the literature.
Here you can see, actually,

211
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
two different proteins being
visualized simultaneously.

212
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
The blue is actually a DNA stain.
That shows you were the nuclei are.

213
00:17:27 --> 00:17:31
The green is one particular protein.
And you can see that it's largely

214
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
cytoplasmic.  And the red is another
protein rimming the plasma membrane

215
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
of these cells.
There are a whole bunch of cells

216
00:17:39 --> 00:17:43
here.  You can see their shape by
where the red color is.

217
00:17:43 --> 00:17:46
And the green is then marking the
other protein which is largely

218
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
cytoplasmic.  In this example,
similar to what I drew on the board,

219
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
the fusion protein is in the nucleus.
So the fusion protein is a nuclear

220
00:17:54 --> 00:17:58
protein.  It drags the GFP with it
into the nucleus.

221
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
This is a structure called the
endoplasmic reticulum,

222
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
the ER.  We'll come back to it later
in the lecture.

223
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
It's involved in the sorting of
proteins to different parts of the

224
00:18:07 --> 00:18:11
cell.  And here's an ER protein
that's been fussed to GFP.

225
00:18:11 --> 00:18:14
So now the signal is coming from
this structure inside the cell,

226
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
the endoplasmic reticulum.  And here
is a protein which resides in the

227
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
mitochondria, that energy-producing
organelle inside the cell.

228
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
You can drag GFP into the
mitochondria to highlight

229
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
those structures.
Here's a red example,

230
00:18:28 --> 00:18:32
RFP fused to a cytoskeletal protein,
so you now see these long filaments

231
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
inside the cell now fluorescing red.
And here's another kind of neat

232
00:18:36 --> 00:18:40
example.  This is a protein that
moves.  It's normally present in the

233
00:18:40 --> 00:18:44
cytoplasm.  As you can see here it's
filling the cytoplasm of the cell

234
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
and it's not in the nucleus which is
labeled green.

235
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
However, in response to a signal
the protein moves.

236
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
It goes from the cytoplasm into the
nucleus.  It might be,

237
00:18:56 --> 00:19:00
for example, a transcription factor,
which is kept in the cytoplasm so

238
00:19:00 --> 00:19:04
that it won't turn on the expression
of its target genes.

239
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08
But in response to the signal it now
moves from the cytoplasm into the

240
00:19:08 --> 00:19:12
nucleus such that it can access the
DNA and begin to turn on the

241
00:19:12 --> 00:19:17
expression of those genes.
OK?  So proteins can be followed

242
00:19:17 --> 00:19:21
dynamically.  And you can actually
do movies of these things

243
00:19:21 --> 00:19:30
over time.  OK.

244
00:19:30 --> 00:19:36
So proteins can be moved from place
to place.  How do they get there?

245
00:19:36 --> 00:19:42
What is the mechanism by which
proteins move from one compartment

246
00:19:42 --> 00:19:48
of the cell to another?
How do they know where to go?

247
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
There are two answers to this
question.  One is signals

248
00:19:54 --> 00:20:02
in the polypeptide.

249
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
Signals within the polypeptide tell
the protein where to go.

250
00:20:06 --> 00:20:11
These signals can be short,
a few amino acids, four, five amino

251
00:20:11 --> 00:20:15
acids, they can be a little longer,
15 or 20 amino acids, but they

252
00:20:15 --> 00:20:20
mostly function as a molecular zip
code.  They can be read by the

253
00:20:20 --> 00:20:25
cell's protein sorting machinery.
Like a post office reads a zip code,

254
00:20:25 --> 00:20:30
it knows to send certain letters to
certain places.

255
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
This machinery reads these signals
and sends proteins to different

256
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
places within the cell.
There's also a separate and

257
00:20:38 --> 00:20:45
sometimes related mechanism --

258
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
-- known as post-translational
modification.

259
00:20:48 --> 00:20:53
Here it's not a sequence within the

260
00:20:53 --> 00:20:56
protein amino acid sequence.
It's not a signal within the amino

261
00:20:56 --> 00:20:59
acid sequence,
but rather it's something that's

262
00:20:59 --> 00:21:02
added onto the protein after it's
been made.  That's why it's called

263
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06
post-translational.
And, again, this can influence where

264
00:21:06 --> 00:21:11
the protein ends up inside the cell.
So let me give you some examples of

265
00:21:11 --> 00:21:16
what I'm talking about here.
With respect to signals that are

266
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
contained within the polypeptide,
proteins that are synthesized in the

267
00:21:22 --> 00:21:27
cytoplasm on ribosomes,
this is a ribosome, this is a mRNA,

268
00:21:27 --> 00:21:32
5 prime end, 3 prime end, will give
rise, through the process of

269
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
translation, to proteins.
And when this process is completed,

270
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
those proteins will be released into
the cytoplasm of the cell.

271
00:21:40 --> 00:21:44
OK?  Most translation occurs freely
inside the cytoplasm of the cell.

272
00:21:44 --> 00:21:48
There are exceptions to that, as
I'll show you in a moment.

273
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
Most of it takes place freely in
the cytoplasm of the cell,

274
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
so when the process is done protein
winds up in the cytoplasm.

275
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
These proteins have two fates
generally speaking.

276
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
One is that they remain cytoplasmic.
And I gave you some examples of

277
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
cytoplasmic proteins earlier.
Lots of the enzymes that are

278
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
present inside your cells just hang
out inside the cytoplasm and do

279
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
their job.  Other proteins are
synthesized first in the cytoplasm

280
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
will end up going to the nucleus,
and these proteins are

281
00:22:21 --> 00:22:25
distinguishable by virtue of the
fact that the ones that end up in

282
00:22:25 --> 00:22:30
the nucleus have a little
tag on them.

283
00:22:30 --> 00:22:37
And this little tag has a name
called the nuclear localization

284
00:22:37 --> 00:22:47
sequence.

285
00:22:47 --> 00:22:52
This is one of the short tags.
It can be just four or five amino

286
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
acids, usually positively charged.
And inside the cytoplasm of this

287
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
cell there are proteins which will
recognize that little tag.

288
00:23:04 --> 00:23:10
Attached to it these proteins
belong to a class known as importins.

289
00:23:10 --> 00:23:16
And what the importins do is drag
the protein that has an NLS to the

290
00:23:16 --> 00:23:22
nucleus where they interact with a
structure within the membrane of the

291
00:23:22 --> 00:23:28
nucleus known as the nuclear
pore complex.

292
00:23:28 --> 00:23:37
And importin then drags the protein

293
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
into the nucleus.
It imports it into the nucleus.

294
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
So nuclear proteins get into the
nucleus by virtue of the fact that

295
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
they have a nuclear localization
sequence on them.

296
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
OK?  And you might imagine,
and probably you will think hard

297
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
about how you could visualize this
process of nuclear importation,

298
00:23:57 --> 00:24:01
for example, in a problem set.
So that's how cytoplasmic resident

299
00:24:01 --> 00:24:05
proteins are distinguished from
nuclear proteins.

300
00:24:05 --> 00:24:08
What about the proteins that fully
leave the cell?

301
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
Many proteins that you make
actually get secreted.

302
00:24:12 --> 00:24:15
They leave the cell entirely.
Still other proteins wind up on the

303
00:24:15 --> 00:24:19
membrane itself.
We're going to talk later in the

304
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
lecture and next time about
receptors that sit on the outside of

305
00:24:22 --> 00:24:26
your cell waiting for signals to be
sent.  Those proteins have to get

306
00:24:26 --> 00:24:30
there, and there's a special
mechanism that insures that.

307
00:24:30 --> 00:24:43
So this applies to both secreted,

308
00:24:43 --> 00:24:49
as well as what we refer to as
transmembrane proteins.

309
00:24:49 --> 00:24:57
And here the situation is a little

310
00:24:57 --> 00:25:01
bit different.
In this case, when the ribosomes

311
00:25:01 --> 00:25:05
synthesize the very first few amino
acids, the very first polypeptide

312
00:25:05 --> 00:25:09
chain, at the end,
the end terminal end of these

313
00:25:09 --> 00:25:13
polypeptides, as they're emerging
from the ribosome there is a longer,

314
00:25:13 --> 00:25:17
more like 15 or 20 amino acid
sequence known as the

315
00:25:17 --> 00:25:25
signal sequence.

316
00:25:25 --> 00:25:28
If a protein has a signal sequence
on its end you know it's going to

317
00:25:28 --> 00:25:31
end up as a secreted protein or a
transmembrane protein.

318
00:25:31 --> 00:25:34
And when it emerges from the bottom
of the ribosome,

319
00:25:34 --> 00:25:37
as depicted here,
there's a specialized protein that

320
00:25:37 --> 00:25:40
will bind to it,
it's actually a complex of proteins

321
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
called the signal recognition
particle.

322
00:25:44 --> 00:25:55
SRP has a very important function,

323
00:25:55 --> 00:25:59
actually two important functions.
Firstly, when it binds to the

324
00:25:59 --> 00:26:03
ribosome, when it binds to the
signal sequence like this it leads

325
00:26:03 --> 00:26:11
to translational arrest.

326
00:26:11 --> 00:26:17
It stops translation.
It blocks the process of

327
00:26:17 --> 00:26:24
translation right at this point.
OK?  The next thing that happens is

328
00:26:24 --> 00:26:30
that it drags this complex of the
ribosome with its little nascent

329
00:26:30 --> 00:26:37
polypeptide to a structure known as
the endoplasmic reticulum.

330
00:26:37 --> 00:26:51
In the membrane of the endoplasmic

331
00:26:51 --> 00:26:57
reticulum.  That was really loud.
Is it that phone?  I got to do this

332
00:26:57 --> 00:27:02
the other day in a class.
Hello.  Oh, they hung up.

333
00:27:02 --> 00:27:06
Last time I was teaching a class
and the computer guy left his cell

334
00:27:06 --> 00:27:11
phone, and it rang.
And the name of the person calling

335
00:27:11 --> 00:27:16
actually showed up on the screen,
so I picked it up and I said Herb.

336
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
And we actually talked for about
five minutes and I told him I had to

337
00:27:20 --> 00:27:25
go and keep teaching a class.
Anyway, inside the endoplasmic

338
00:27:25 --> 00:27:30
reticulum there's another receptor,
not unlike the nuclear pore complex.

339
00:27:30 --> 00:27:35
This is called the SRP receptor.
It binds to this thing SRP, signal

340
00:27:35 --> 00:27:41
recognition particle.
And this then allows SRP to go away

341
00:27:41 --> 00:27:47
and allows translation to continue
allowing the protein to be

342
00:27:47 --> 00:27:53
synthesized through this membrane
and end up inside the endoplasmic

343
00:27:53 --> 00:27:59
reticulum.  So the end result of
this process is that the protein

344
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
will now reside within this
structure, this membrane-bound

345
00:28:05 --> 00:28:12
structure.
Subsequently, the protein leaves

346
00:28:12 --> 00:28:24
this structure in a vesicle.

347
00:28:24 --> 00:28:29
It buds off the membrane,
gets carried like cargo in a little

348
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
pod coming off the mother ship here.
It goes to another sorting

349
00:28:34 --> 00:28:39
structure called the Golgi apparatus.
And it eventually goes to the

350
00:28:39 --> 00:28:45
plasma membrane where it fuses to
the plasma membrane allowing this

351
00:28:45 --> 00:28:50
secreted protein to leave the cell.
I realize that this is a little bit

352
00:28:50 --> 00:28:56
messy, but there are comparable
pictures in your book.

353
00:28:56 --> 00:28:59
The point being that these proteins
have a signal which drags them to

354
00:28:59 --> 00:29:03
the ER.  There's then a sorting
process that takes them out of the

355
00:29:03 --> 00:29:07
cell, takes them to the plasma
membrane and then out of the cell.

356
00:29:07 --> 00:29:11
So that's how you deal with
secreted proteins.

357
00:29:11 --> 00:29:14
How do you deal with proteins that
end up in the membrane?

358
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
If they don't get secreted they
wind up resident in the plasma

359
00:29:18 --> 00:29:22
membrane.  This happens by virtue of
another signal.

360
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
And I'm going to pick up this
process, the beginning of the

361
00:29:25 --> 00:29:29
process is exactly the same.
I'm going to pick up this process

362
00:29:29 --> 00:29:33
at a slightly later point where we
have the SRP receptor

363
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
bound by a ribosome.
It's actually partway through the

364
00:29:37 --> 00:29:42
process of producing a polypeptide
that has wound up inside the ER.

365
00:29:42 --> 00:29:47
For proteins that wind up
ultimately in the membrane there's

366
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
another sequence called a
stop transfer sequence.

367
00:29:53 --> 00:30:02
And when a stop transfer sequence is

368
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
hit and recognized by this complex
it causes the ribosome to

369
00:30:06 --> 00:30:11
disassociate from the mRNA,
or rather allows the synthesis to

370
00:30:11 --> 00:30:16
occur without continuous transfer
through this complex.

371
00:30:16 --> 00:30:20
So the protein just gets built on
this side of the membrane.

372
00:30:20 --> 00:30:25
And the result of that then is a
protein that ends up halfway in and

373
00:30:25 --> 00:30:30
halfway out of the endoplasmic
reticulum.

374
00:30:30 --> 00:30:35
If you then take this through the
sort of sorting steps that I just

375
00:30:35 --> 00:30:40
outlined for secreted proteins,
this protein will end up with part

376
00:30:40 --> 00:30:46
of it on the outside and part of it
on the inside of the cell.

377
00:30:46 --> 00:30:53
OK?  So that's how we deal with

378
00:30:53 --> 00:30:57
proteins that are transmembrane.
And you'll actually see proteins

379
00:30:57 --> 00:31:01
that go through the membrane
multiple times.

380
00:31:01 --> 00:31:05
That's because they have signal
sequences and stop transfer sequence,

381
00:31:05 --> 00:31:10
signal sequences and stop transfer
sequences that allow them to

382
00:31:10 --> 00:31:15
transition through the membrane more
than once.  Many of the proteins

383
00:31:15 --> 00:31:20
just once but other proteins
multiple times.

384
00:31:20 --> 00:31:25
OK.  So that's the way it's done in
terms of signal recognition.

385
00:31:25 --> 00:31:32
I also mentioned that there is this

386
00:31:32 --> 00:31:38
class of posttranslational
modification.  Proteins get modified

387
00:31:38 --> 00:31:45
after they're made by translation.
And the examples include

388
00:31:45 --> 00:31:51
proteolysis.  The protein might
actually get cleaved,

389
00:31:51 --> 00:31:58
cut.  Half of it goes one place.
The other half goes somewhere else.

390
00:31:58 --> 00:32:07
Phosphorylation.

391
00:32:07 --> 00:32:13
Addition of a phosphate can
determine the localization of a

392
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
protein.  Glycosylation.
Addition of sugar groups,

393
00:32:19 --> 00:32:25
carbohydrates onto the protein can
determine where the protein goes.

394
00:32:25 --> 00:32:33
And finally lipid addition.

395
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
Addition of a lipid molecule can
determine where the protein goes.

396
00:32:37 --> 00:32:41
And I'll give you one example of
that last one.

397
00:32:41 --> 00:32:46
A protein that we work on in my lab,
the protein called RAS,

398
00:32:46 --> 00:32:50
which will actually come up in the
next lecture.  It's a signaling

399
00:32:50 --> 00:32:55
protein, which actually turns out to
be very important in cancer.

400
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59
In its unmodified state the protein
is cytoplasmic.

401
00:32:59 --> 00:33:04
However, it gets modified by an
enzyme called farnesyltransferase.

402
00:33:04 --> 00:33:12
Which modifies the very end of the

403
00:33:12 --> 00:33:18
protein, the C terminal end of the
protein, and it sticks onto it a

404
00:33:18 --> 00:33:24
lipid group, about a 20 carbon lipid
group, which is very much like the

405
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
fatty acid side chains in
the plasma membrane.

406
00:33:30 --> 00:33:33
And, in fact, this is a very
hydrophobic structure.

407
00:33:33 --> 00:33:37
And it ends up dragging the protein
to the plasma membrane.

408
00:33:37 --> 00:33:41
Here's the plasma membrane.
I'm drawing it now as a lipid

409
00:33:41 --> 00:33:45
bilayer, whereas I drew it as a
single line previously.

410
00:33:45 --> 00:33:48
And that lipid tail, which has been
stuck on the RAS protein,

411
00:33:48 --> 00:33:52
inserts into the lipid bilayer and
localizes RAS then to the plasma

412
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
membrane.  OK?
So here are examples of

413
00:33:56 --> 00:34:00
post-translational modifications
that effect where the protein

414
00:34:00 --> 00:34:04
ends up going.
So we can determine where the

415
00:34:04 --> 00:34:08
protein goes, that's very important.
I also want to make the point

416
00:34:08 --> 00:34:12
before we move onto the next topic
that protein-protein interactions

417
00:34:12 --> 00:34:16
are very important in determining
function.  These proteins that we've

418
00:34:16 --> 00:34:20
been talking about almost never,
probably never do their functions by

419
00:34:20 --> 00:34:24
themselves.  They interact with
other proteins.

420
00:34:24 --> 00:34:28
And these are determined,
again, by sequences that bind to one

421
00:34:28 --> 00:34:31
another between the two proteins.
So this is actually a protein

422
00:34:31 --> 00:34:35
structure from a colleague here at
MIT, Thomas Schwartz,

423
00:34:35 --> 00:34:39
solved by him.  What you're going to
look at hopefully,

424
00:34:39 --> 00:34:42
this is a ribbon diagram of two
proteins, the one in blue and the

425
00:34:42 --> 00:34:46
one in pink.  And you can see that
these two proteins bind to each

426
00:34:46 --> 00:34:49
other based on amino acid residues
at this interface between the two

427
00:34:49 --> 00:34:53
proteins.  This ribbon diagram will
be replaced by a space-filling model.

428
00:34:53 --> 00:34:57
This is what the protein really
would like inside the cell.

429
00:34:57 --> 00:35:00
And here's that interface more
clearly visualized with residues in

430
00:35:00 --> 00:35:04
light blue on one side,
pink on the other that allows the

431
00:35:04 --> 00:35:07
two proteins to interact.
So protein-protein interaction is

432
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
extremely important,
allowing proteins to interact either

433
00:35:11 --> 00:35:15
for a long time because they carry
out some essential function together

434
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
or very transiently.
Protein-protein interactions can be

435
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
long-lasting or very transient.
And to just give you a visual

436
00:35:23 --> 00:35:27
reminder of that,
the transient interaction,

437
00:35:27 --> 00:35:31
this I took a couple of years ago,
Johnny Damon getting run into by

438
00:35:31 --> 00:35:35
Damian Jackson.
A very transient but actually quite

439
00:35:35 --> 00:35:39
important interaction between these
two baseball players.

440
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
And then there can be longer
lasting interactions.

441
00:35:43 --> 00:35:48
Here's Brad Pitt, well,
it's not that long-lasting,

442
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
I guess, but the point is that
proteins do interact either very

443
00:35:52 --> 00:35:56
transiently or in a long-lasting way.
Jennifer actually did the cutting

444
00:35:56 --> 00:36:01
out herself of this picture
that she sent me.

445
00:36:01 --> 00:36:08
OK.  Finally, proteins can change

446
00:36:08 --> 00:36:12
their shape.  Proteins can change
their shape in response to binding

447
00:36:12 --> 00:36:16
of other proteins or binding of
cofactors that they interact with.

448
00:36:16 --> 00:36:21
And here's another movie from
Thomas Schwartz.

449
00:36:21 --> 00:36:25
This is a signaling protein,
much like the RAS protein actually.

450
00:36:25 --> 00:36:29
And you'll see that upon binding to
a nucleotide here,

451
00:36:29 --> 00:36:34
the protein dramatically changes its
shape.

452
00:36:34 --> 00:36:38
It actually unwinds a little bit and
exposes a new structure for binding.

453
00:36:38 --> 00:36:42
And this is one of the critical
ways that proteins participate in

454
00:36:42 --> 00:36:46
this signal transduction,
signal processing function.

455
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
They receive signals, change their
shape, and this allows them to bind

456
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
to other proteins or carry out other
functions.  OK.

457
00:36:54 --> 00:36:58
So I want to move now to the
signaling introduction for the last

458
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
12 minutes or so.
I started the day with this slide of

459
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
cells moving around.
They're receiving signals from one

460
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
another or from the medium and
they're responding to it.

461
00:37:10 --> 00:37:14
I also gave you examples of cells
dividing or not dividing,

462
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
cells differentiating, turning into
one type of end-stage cell or

463
00:37:18 --> 00:37:22
another, changing their function.
We'll talk later about cells that

464
00:37:22 --> 00:37:26
receive signals and kill other cells,
cells that receive signals and

465
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
commit suicide in a couple
of more lectures.

466
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
So cells will do very complicated
things in receipt of various signals.

467
00:37:36 --> 00:37:42
And this general process is known
as signal transduction.

468
00:37:42 --> 00:37:49
And basically it's the ability of
cells to respond to things in their

469
00:37:49 --> 00:37:55
extracellular environment,
stimuli in their extracellular

470
00:37:55 --> 00:38:01
environment.
These could be physical stimuli,

471
00:38:01 --> 00:38:06
light, odorants, or they could be
biological stimuli,

472
00:38:06 --> 00:38:12
peptides, proteins, hormones,
which then get sent first from the

473
00:38:12 --> 00:38:17
outside of the cell and then to the
inside of the cell leading to either

474
00:38:17 --> 00:38:29
short-term responses --

475
00:38:29 --> 00:38:33
I'll give you an example of glucose
secretion in response to a hormone

476
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
epinephrine or adrenalin.
This happens exclusively inside the

477
00:38:37 --> 00:38:42
cytoplasm of the cell.
The signal is received,

478
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
processed, and the result is the
secretion of glucose.

479
00:38:46 --> 00:38:51
Other signals will make their way
into the nucleus of the cell,

480
00:38:51 --> 00:38:55
and this might lead to changes in
gene expression.

481
00:38:55 --> 00:39:00
New genes are turned.
Others might be turned off.

482
00:39:00 --> 00:39:04
Changes in gene expression.
And this might lead to a longer

483
00:39:04 --> 00:39:09
term response.
And we'll give you an example of

484
00:39:09 --> 00:39:14
this in the next lecture.
So how does this work?  Well,

485
00:39:14 --> 00:39:19
it's different in every way.  Each
example is slightly different.

486
00:39:19 --> 00:39:24
I show you this slide to give you
sort of a visual picture of what

487
00:39:24 --> 00:39:28
it's like, we think.
Like one of these,

488
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
what do they call them,
Kineto-something or rather

489
00:39:32 --> 00:39:35
sculptures that you see at Logan
Airport, for example,

490
00:39:35 --> 00:39:39
where a small perturbation at one
end is propagated through a series

491
00:39:39 --> 00:39:42
of devices and leads to sounds and
whistles and movements taking place

492
00:39:42 --> 00:39:46
within the structure.
It's not unlike dominos.

493
00:39:46 --> 00:39:49
When you flip a domino at one end
it can spread,

494
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
increasing its effect because of the
involvement of additional dominoes

495
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
as it goes along a complex
structure.

496
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
We actually found,
as we were looking at the Web for

497
00:40:01 --> 00:40:06
pictures of this movie of Mr.
Domino, does anybody know what Mr.

498
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10
Domino is?  I had no idea.  It's a
computer game,

499
00:40:10 --> 00:40:15
and they have a cool little
animation which I thought I would

500
00:40:15 --> 00:40:19
show you.  Here's Mr.
Domino.  And it's actually kind of

501
00:40:19 --> 00:40:24
relevant because he'll go and his
signal is being transmitted along a

502
00:40:24 --> 00:40:29
linear path involving other types of
molecules spreading out.

503
00:40:29 --> 00:40:34
Again, other types of molecules
being involved,

504
00:40:34 --> 00:40:39
and so on and so forth.
It's not a great example but it is

505
00:40:39 --> 00:40:44
kind of fun.  OK.
So before I give you a specific

506
00:40:44 --> 00:40:49
example, I want to give you some
principles about signal transduction.

507
00:40:49 --> 00:40:55
And, again, the principles that are
relevant here in biology are not

508
00:40:55 --> 00:41:00
dissimilar to signal propagation in
electrical engineering,

509
00:41:00 --> 00:41:05
for example.
Signal transduction in its simplest

510
00:41:05 --> 00:41:11
form means that something which
takes some form,

511
00:41:11 --> 00:41:16
like a ligand binding to a receptor
on the surface of the cell,

512
00:41:16 --> 00:41:22
changes its form inside the cell.
It causes a change at the membrane

513
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
to produce a different type of
response inside the cell.

514
00:41:28 --> 00:41:32
Importantly, for almost all of these
signal transduction pathways,

515
00:41:32 --> 00:41:37
what happens at the membrane is
usually inadequate to change

516
00:41:37 --> 00:41:42
whatever process is to be changed
inside the cell such that it is

517
00:41:42 --> 00:41:47
necessary for signal amplification
to take place.

518
00:41:47 --> 00:41:52
And we'll give you examples of how
signal amplification occurs in

519
00:41:52 --> 00:41:57
biology.  But rather than making one
square, in fact, you might

520
00:41:57 --> 00:42:02
make multiple squares.
There's also the opportunity,

521
00:42:02 --> 00:42:07
and it's often the case for signal
diversification,

522
00:42:07 --> 00:42:12
so that in response to the same
signal, in fact,

523
00:42:12 --> 00:42:16
processed slightly different ways
temporally or spatially with inside

524
00:42:16 --> 00:42:21
the cell you might make,
sorry, let's make this a circle.

525
00:42:21 --> 00:42:26
You might make two different
responses that coordinate the

526
00:42:26 --> 00:43:00
overall cellular response.

527
00:43:00 --> 00:43:03
There's the opportunity for what we
call signal integration.

528
00:43:03 --> 00:43:11
So with respect to signal

529
00:43:11 --> 00:43:16
integration, you might imagine one
signal which produces a particular

530
00:43:16 --> 00:43:21
response.  A separate signal which
produces a distinct response.

531
00:43:21 --> 00:43:26
But if you add the two together,
that is if both signals are received

532
00:43:26 --> 00:43:32
simultaneously, you get
some third response.

533
00:43:32 --> 00:43:35
So signal integration,
again, not unlike electrical

534
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
engineering.  And finally
signal modulation.

535
00:43:39 --> 00:43:47
So let's imagine again that we have,

536
00:43:47 --> 00:43:52
in some circumstances, a particular
signal giving a particular response.

537
00:43:52 --> 00:43:57
If, in a different context with a
different signal being received by

538
00:43:57 --> 00:44:02
the cell at the same time,
instead of producing this response,

539
00:44:02 --> 00:44:08
there's an inhibitory effect so that
nothing is produced.

540
00:44:08 --> 00:44:12
This signal inhibits the processing
of this signal,

541
00:44:12 --> 00:44:17
so this is inhibitory.
And you could imagine,

542
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
and we know exists, the opposite
such that in the presence of this

543
00:44:21 --> 00:44:26
signal plus now a distinct signal
there's an augmentation of the

544
00:44:26 --> 00:44:31
response so that now you make much
more of whatever you were making.

545
00:44:31 --> 00:44:36
So this is augmentation.
So all of these things happen in

546
00:44:36 --> 00:44:42
the process of cellular signal
transduction, cellular signal

547
00:44:42 --> 00:44:47
processing.  At the beginning of
this process, for at least the

548
00:44:47 --> 00:44:53
examples we're going to talk about,
things happen at the plasma membrane.

549
00:44:53 --> 00:45:05
So here is the plasma membrane again.

550
00:45:05 --> 00:45:09
You can think of the plasma
membrane as sort of the outside of

551
00:45:09 --> 00:45:13
your house with the antennas
sticking up into the air waiting for

552
00:45:13 --> 00:45:18
signals to be received.
Well, in biological circumstances,

553
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
those antennas are polypeptide
receptors.  These are in this

554
00:45:22 --> 00:45:26
category.  Or proteins that have
transmembrane domains,

555
00:45:26 --> 00:45:31
get stuck in the membrane,
and end up on the plasma membrane.

556
00:45:31 --> 00:45:35
These polypeptide receptors are
sitting out there.

557
00:45:35 --> 00:45:40
There are often thousands of a
given polypeptide receptor type on

558
00:45:40 --> 00:45:45
the outside of a cell.
And these bind to ligands that fit

559
00:45:45 --> 00:45:49
inside them.  There's
complementarity between the shape of

560
00:45:49 --> 00:45:54
the ligand and the receptor such
that you get specific binding of the

561
00:45:54 --> 00:45:59
ligand to the receptor.
The consequences of binding of

562
00:45:59 --> 00:46:03
ligand to receptor we generally
think of now as changing the shape

563
00:46:03 --> 00:46:08
of the receptor.
Something that happens on the

564
00:46:08 --> 00:46:13
outside through binding of the
ligand to the receptor is propagated

565
00:46:13 --> 00:46:17
through this polypeptide chain to a
change in the structure at the

566
00:46:17 --> 00:46:22
inside.  OK?  It's as though I took
this guy's head and I twisted it.

567
00:46:22 --> 00:46:27
Eventually his feet are going to
move.  The same thing here.

568
00:46:27 --> 00:46:31
If I make a change out here,
I can propagate that change through

569
00:46:31 --> 00:46:36
the polypeptide chain and change the
inside structure.

570
00:46:36 --> 00:46:41
So if you imagine a ligand which
has a particular structure,

571
00:46:41 --> 00:46:45
I'm sorry a receptor that has a
particular structure,

572
00:46:45 --> 00:46:50
when you add the ligand you now
change the structure.

573
00:46:50 --> 00:46:55
And take a protein that might be
inactive, this might have some

574
00:46:55 --> 00:47:00
enzymatic activity,
from inactive to one that's active.

575
00:47:00 --> 00:47:05
Or another example,
if I take this receptor and I bind

576
00:47:05 --> 00:47:11
the ligand, change its structure,
I might now allow, based on this

577
00:47:11 --> 00:47:16
change in its structure,
an interaction between this protein

578
00:47:16 --> 00:47:22
and some other signaling molecule,
some other signaling protein.  And,

579
00:47:22 --> 00:47:28
again, we know examples of all of
those things.

580
00:47:28 --> 00:47:44
Usually, maybe always,

581
00:47:44 --> 00:47:48
the change that takes place at the
plasma membrane,

582
00:47:48 --> 00:47:52
like the first domino that you flip,
doesn't have enough energy

583
00:47:52 --> 00:47:56
associated with it to change the
biological response.

584
00:47:56 --> 00:48:00
It's necessary to propagate that
signal and to amplify that signal

585
00:48:00 --> 00:48:05
through various stages.
This process of signal amplification

586
00:48:05 --> 00:48:11
is very important.
And there are two general classes

587
00:48:11 --> 00:48:17
of signal amplification.
One is the production of secondary

588
00:48:17 --> 00:48:23
signaling molecules called second
messengers.  And the example that

589
00:48:23 --> 00:48:30
we'll give you next time is the
second messenger cyclic AMP --

590
00:48:30 --> 00:48:34
-- which can be produced in large
amounts following the binding of a

591
00:48:34 --> 00:48:39
ligand to a receptor,
thereby amplifying the signal.

592
00:48:39 --> 00:48:43
And the other, which we'll give you
as two examples next time,

593
00:48:43 --> 00:48:48
is enzymatic, very often kinase
cascades.  Enzymatic cascades where

594
00:48:48 --> 00:48:52
you turn on the activity of one
enzyme, which turns on the activity

595
00:48:52 --> 00:48:57
of more other enzymes,
which turn on the activity of still

596
00:48:57 --> 00:49:01
more other enzymes and so on.
So, we'll talk about specifics

597
00:49:01 --> 00:49:04
related to these next time.
