1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
So we're going to continue our
discussion about genetics and

2
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
patterns of inheritance.
We're going go relatively quickly

3
00:00:22 --> 00:00:26
compared to last time.
We've got a lot to get through

4
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
today so I'm going to go
relatively quickly.

5
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
And I printed a handout for you
because I'm going to rely on the

6
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
PowerPoint to a greater degree than
I have before.

7
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
So I want you to have them in case
you want to take notes on them.

8
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
OK?  And we will do that
occasionally for particular lectures.

9
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
Now, importantly,
we teach you about inheritance,

10
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
not so much because we think you
need to know about peas but rather

11
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
the rules of inheritance which were
derived from such studies but

12
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
applied to many other studies.
Including in agricultural settings,

13
00:01:02 --> 00:01:07
in research settings in the
laboratory involving fruit flies and

14
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
mice, but more relevant to you to
humans.  The rules that Mendel laid

15
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
down apply to you and allow us to
predict inheritance patterns based

16
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
on visible traits but also disease
traits.  And you'll see in next

17
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
lecture that the information that
we've given you helps us understand

18
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
inheritance of various forms of
genetic disease and predict,

19
00:01:32 --> 00:01:37
for example, frequencies within such
pedigrees.

20
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
OK.  So, firstly,

21
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
I wanted to review some terms which
you need to know.

22
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
And I'll use a lot today.
The genotype which is the alleles

23
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
present for a given gene in an
individual.  OK?

24
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
The genes.  The alleles.
The term homozygous which means

25
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
having two of the same alleles.
Heterozygous, having two different

26
00:02:02 --> 00:02:06
alleles for a given gene.
The phenotype which refers to the

27
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
trait.  That's what the researcher
or the individual observes.

28
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
The manifestation of the activity
of those genes,

29
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
of those alleles,
the observed trait.

30
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
The first filial, or F1,
generation which is the product of a

31
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
cross of individuals who are
homozygous for different alleles of

32
00:02:26 --> 00:02:31
a given trait.
I think this should say gene,

33
00:02:31 --> 00:02:36
not given, given.  Such that the F1
individual is heterozygous for that

34
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
gene.  That is,
has two different alleles.

35
00:02:41 --> 00:02:46
If you cross two F1s together you
generate the F2 generation.

36
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
The products of an F1 intercross.
And based on Mendel's First Laws,

37
00:02:51 --> 00:02:56
which I told you about last time and
I'll reiterate in a second,

38
00:02:56 --> 00:03:01
the ratio of the genotypes that you
see in the F2 generation is 1:2:1.

39
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
Homozygous for one allele,
heterozygous and homozygous for the

40
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
other allele; 1:2:1.
And the ratio of phenotypes is 3:1.

41
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
That assumes that there is a simple
dominant recessive relationship

42
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
between the two alleles.
We closed with that last time.

43
00:03:18 --> 00:03:23
The dominant is the allele that
determines the phenotype in a

44
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
heterozygous individual.
Big S, little S you're smooth.

45
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
Big S is dominant over little S.
Recessive allele is the opposite.

46
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
In a heterozygote it's not seen.
And, in fact, the only time you see

47
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
the phenotype associated with the
recessive allele is when the

48
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
organism is homozygous for that
recessive allele.

49
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
And finally there's a term
codominance, which I'm going to

50
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
mention now.  They don't really need
to know, Claudette?

51
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
We bring it up in Section,
so I'm going to mention it here.

52
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
And I refer you to the relevant
parts of the book,

53
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
but I'm not going to cover it in
lecture but I'll show you where to

54
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
go in the book to review that.
And that's relevant because Mendel's

55
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
Rules apply as simple dominant
recessive relationships,

56
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
but they actually don't apply in
terms of scoring them when you have

57
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
a codominant situation.
So this is Mendel's First Law laid

58
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
out for you.  When any individual
produces gametes,

59
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
germ cells, sperm,
egg, the alleles, for a particular

60
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
gene which control particular traits
separates, so that each gamete

61
00:04:27 --> 00:04:31
receives only one of a pair of
alleles present in the

62
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
original individual.
And, as I said just a second ago,

63
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
these experimental tests work well
when there's a simple dominant

64
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
recessive relationship between those
two alleles.  There are exceptions

65
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
to this in terms of codominance and
incomplete dominance.

66
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
And I refer you to Figures 10.
3 and 10.14 in your book which show

67
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
you examples from fruit flies as
well as, sorry,

68
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
from humans as well as from pea
plants that illustrate both

69
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
codominance and incomplete
dominance.

70
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
Now, to emphasize the simplicity,
really, of Mendel's First Law, I

71
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
want to show you an example which
also derives from your book using

72
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
coins.  OK?  And it's just to
emphasize the point about

73
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
probability.  So what this says is
that you have two,

74
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
if you have two alleles of a given
gene, big A, little A,

75
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
big S, little S, you're going to
hand off to your germ cells one or

76
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
the other with equal probability.
And your mate will do the same such

77
00:05:32 --> 00:05:37
that the genotype of the offspring
is the product of the probabilities

78
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
of the genotype of the germ cells.
OK?  So I have two coins here, two

79
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
pennies which have a head and a tail.
All right?  Head.

80
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
Tail.  So if I flipped this coin,
what's the likelihood that this is a

81
00:05:53 --> 00:05:59
head?  1:2.  If I flip this coin,
what's the likelihood that it's a

82
00:05:59 --> 00:06:04
head?
1:2.  If I put these together,

83
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
like in fertilization, what's the
likelihood that it's both heads?

84
00:06:08 --> 00:06:13
1:4.  Very good.  One in two times
one in two is one in four.

85
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
That's really the essence of
Mendel's First Law that the alleles

86
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
segregate randomly into the germ
cells, and you can then figure out

87
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
Punnett Squares and the phenotype
based on the probabilities of the

88
00:06:27 --> 00:06:32
different genotypes that derive from
that simple calculation.

89
00:06:32 --> 00:06:39
OK.  We'll come back to a slightly
more complicated version momentarily.

90
00:06:39 --> 00:06:47
OK. Now, last time we talked about
smooth and wrinkled peas.

91
00:06:47 --> 00:06:55
I don't like this yellow chalk.
Is there white chalk here?

92
00:06:55 --> 00:07:05
We talked about smooth and yellow

93
00:07:05 --> 00:07:12
peas, smooth and wrinkled peas.
We talked about genotypes, big S,

94
00:07:12 --> 00:07:20
big S, big S, little S, little S,
little S.  Remember that?

95
00:07:20 --> 00:07:27
We talked about phenotypes.
What's the phenotype of this pea?

96
00:07:27 --> 00:07:35
Smooth.
What's the phenotype of this pea?

97
00:07:35 --> 00:07:44
Smooth, because you know that big S
is dominant over little S.

98
00:07:44 --> 00:07:52
And what's the phenotype of this
pea?  Wrinkled.

99
00:07:52 --> 00:08:01
Good.  What if I gave you,
I handed to you on your dinner plate

100
00:08:01 --> 00:08:08
a smooth pea?
What's its genotype?

101
00:08:08 --> 00:08:14
What's its genotype?
Who wants to venture out into the

102
00:08:14 --> 00:08:20
unknown here?  What's its genotype?
Come on.  Yes?  Thank you.  You

103
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
don't know what its genotype is
because it could either be big S,

104
00:08:26 --> 00:08:33
big S or big S, little S.
It could either be big S,

105
00:08:33 --> 00:08:43
big S or big S, little S.  How are
you going to tell?

106
00:08:43 --> 00:08:53
How can you tell?  You can test it.
You could do what we call a Test

107
00:08:53 --> 00:09:03
Cross with a tester strain.
And a tester strain is homozygous

108
00:09:03 --> 00:09:11
for the recessive allele.
OK?  And based on this test we can

109
00:09:11 --> 00:09:17
figure out whether we're dealing
with a big S, big S or big S,

110
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
little S pea.  So we're going to do
this using Punnett Squares to

111
00:09:23 --> 00:09:30
emphasize the use of Punnett Squares.
We have two possibilities.

112
00:09:30 --> 00:09:35
Either our pea is big S,
big S or our pea is big S,

113
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
little S.  Either way we're going to
cross it to a pea,

114
00:09:41 --> 00:09:47
really a pea plant,
but a pea that's little S,

115
00:09:47 --> 00:09:53
little S.  OK?  Now, when I generate
a Punnett Square what gametes do I

116
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
put over here?  What alleles
do I put over here?

117
00:09:59 --> 00:10:04
Little S, little S.
This plant only gives the little S

118
00:10:04 --> 00:10:10
allele to its gametes because that's
all it has.  What alleles do I put

119
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
over here?  Big S on both because
this plant only gives big S to its

120
00:10:15 --> 00:10:21
gametes.  And so therefore all of
the offspring will be heterozygous,

121
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
big S, little S, big S, little S.
And what will the phenotype be of

122
00:10:27 --> 00:10:32
all of the offspring?
Smooth.  100% smooth.

123
00:10:32 --> 00:10:38
OK.  And how about over here?
Well, this side of the Punnett

124
00:10:38 --> 00:10:44
Square is the same.
This individual only gives little S

125
00:10:44 --> 00:10:50
to its gametes.
And how about over here?

126
00:10:50 --> 00:10:56
Flip a coin, half of the time it's
big S, half of the time

127
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
it's little S.
If this gamete meets up with this

128
00:11:01 --> 00:11:06
one then that individual is going to
be big S, little S.

129
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
The same thing over here.
With this gives little S, little S,

130
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
this is the same thing.  What are
the phenotypes here?

131
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
Half and half.  50% smooth,
50% wrinkled.

132
00:11:23 --> 00:11:37
OK.  That's great.  Now --

133
00:11:37 --> 00:11:48
What I want to now consider is a

134
00:11:48 --> 00:11:53
second trait.  And after we do this
we're going to consider the

135
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
inheritance of the two traits
together, but let's just introduce

136
00:11:59 --> 00:12:06
the second trait now.
The gene is the Y gene.

137
00:12:06 --> 00:12:15
There are, again, two alleles,
big Y and little Y.  And the

138
00:12:15 --> 00:12:24
phenotypes associated with these
genotypes are yellow

139
00:12:24 --> 00:12:31
and green.  OK?
Mendel does a lot of crossing,

140
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
etc., creates pure breading strains,
the parental strains.  And I'm going

141
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
to tell you that their genotypes are
homozygous big Y,

142
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
and these produce yellow peas.
He also produces pure breeding

143
00:12:49 --> 00:12:55
strains that only ever produced
green peas, and their genotype is

144
00:12:55 --> 00:13:00
little Y, little Y.
You cross these together to generate

145
00:13:00 --> 00:13:05
the F1.  What's the genotype with
respect to Y in the F1?

146
00:13:05 --> 00:13:11
Big Y, little Y.  They're all big Y,
little Y.  And what's the phenotype

147
00:13:11 --> 00:13:16
of the F1?  You don't know.
That's very good, because I haven't

148
00:13:16 --> 00:13:21
told you which is dominant over
which.  By convention,

149
00:13:21 --> 00:13:26
you might have guessed that big Y
was dominant over little Y.

150
00:13:26 --> 00:13:32
And if that were true, and it is,
then what would be the phenotype?

151
00:13:32 --> 00:13:39
Yellow.  And from that you can
conclude that Y is dominant over

152
00:13:39 --> 00:13:47
little Y.  OK?
I always run out of space.

153
00:13:47 --> 00:13:55
Do these boards get smaller every
year?  I mean it's unbelievable

154
00:13:55 --> 00:14:02
to me.
Now, if we take these F1s and do an

155
00:14:02 --> 00:14:08
intercross to generate F2s,
we're just reinforcing things we

156
00:14:08 --> 00:14:14
just learned here,
in the F2 generation we're going to

157
00:14:14 --> 00:14:20
generate individuals who are Y,
Y, big Y, big Y, big Y, little Y and

158
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
little Y, little Y.
What will be the frequency of

159
00:14:26 --> 00:14:32
generating such individuals
in this cross?

160
00:14:32 --> 00:14:40
One quarter will be like this,
a half will be like this, a quarter

161
00:14:40 --> 00:14:48
will be like this,
and that would give a ration of

162
00:14:48 --> 00:14:56
1:2:1.  The phenotypes associated
with that will be yellow,

163
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
yellow and green.
So the ratio of the phenotypes will

164
00:15:02 --> 00:15:08
be 3:1.  OK?  We just redid Mendel's
First Law for you.

165
00:15:08 --> 00:15:13
Now, what happens when we consider
the two of these traits together,

166
00:15:13 --> 00:15:19
smoothness and color in the same
cross?  Well, this led Mendel to

167
00:15:19 --> 00:15:24
propose his Second Law which is
illustrated here,

168
00:15:24 --> 00:15:30
which is that alleles of different
genes, the S gene and the Y gene,

169
00:15:30 --> 00:15:36
assort independently of one another
in producing gametes.

170
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
What happens for one does not effect
what happens to the other.

171
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
And this is true for genes that lie
on separate chromosomes.

172
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
Although it's not necessarily true
for genes that lie on the same

173
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
chromosome.  I make that point here,
and I'll make it again later because

174
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
I don't want you to come to the
conclusion that two genes always

175
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
assort from one another
independently.

176
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
They do, and Mendel's Second Law is
based on that,

177
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
in some instances,
but they don't always.

178
00:16:03 --> 00:16:08
So to illustrate that point we turn
to the coins again.

179
00:16:08 --> 00:16:13
I always also lose the coins.
OK.  So now we have our pennies

180
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
once again, heads and tails.
And dimes, heads and tails, yeah?

181
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
OK.  So I'm going to put a penny
and a dime in each pocket.

182
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
What's the frequency of generating
a penny in the head configuration

183
00:16:28 --> 00:16:33
and a dime in the head configuration
together?

184
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
Well, let's do it differently.
What's the frequency of generating

185
00:16:37 --> 00:16:42
a head, a penny in the head
configuration here?

186
00:16:42 --> 00:16:47
1:2.  What's the frequency of
getting a penny in the head and dime

187
00:16:47 --> 00:16:52
in the head?  One over four.
It's one in two times one in two.

188
00:16:52 --> 00:16:57
And what's the frequency of getting
penny head, dime head in this hand?

189
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
One over four.
So what's the frequency of getting

190
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
penny head, penny head,
dime head, dime head in the zygote?

191
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11
1:16.  Again, simple probabilities.
OK?  And for Mendel's Second Law in

192
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
its simplest form,
it determines what you would expect

193
00:17:15 --> 00:17:19
to see in such crosses.
And, again, we'll come back to a

194
00:17:19 --> 00:17:24
twist on that in a moment.
Now, in biological terms it looks

195
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
like this.  And this derives from
your book, so you can

196
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
go and look at it.
It's adapted from Purves 10.

197
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
.  And there's a nice little
animation that goes along with that.

198
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
But we're going to go through this
because there's some subtly here

199
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
that I want you to understand.
So here is the parent.  It's a

200
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
diploid.  It has the two chromosomes
that are relevant that carry the S

201
00:17:48 --> 00:17:52
gene and the Y gene.
And the parent is heterozygous for

202
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
both.  It's a double heterozygote.
Big S, little S, big Y, little Y.

203
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
OK?
Now, when this individual undergoes

204
00:18:00 --> 00:18:05
meiosis, it can generate four
possible haploid gametes.

205
00:18:05 --> 00:18:10
And those have the genotypes of all
four combinations.

206
00:18:10 --> 00:18:15
It can be big S, little Y,
big S, big Y, little S, little Y,

207
00:18:15 --> 00:18:20
little S, big Y.  All four
possibilities.

208
00:18:20 --> 00:18:25
And based on the simple laws of
probability that we just went

209
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
through with the coins,
those are generated in equal amounts

210
00:18:30 --> 00:18:35
amongst the gametes.
OK?  They're generated in equal

211
00:18:35 --> 00:18:40
amounts amongst the gametes.
Why are they?  Well, let me just

212
00:18:40 --> 00:18:46
show you another slide that
illustrates it in slightly more

213
00:18:46 --> 00:18:51
detail.  When these guys undergo the
first, undergo duplication to

214
00:18:51 --> 00:18:56
generate the two chromatids for each
chromosomes, enter prophase of

215
00:18:56 --> 00:19:02
meiosis one, the homologs
pair, as you recall.

216
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
The two chromosomes don't have
anything to do with one another.

217
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
The homologs pair but the two
chromosomes don't have anything to

218
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
do with one another.
They're independent of each other.

219
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
Now, if we consider this chromosome,
the one that carries the S gene,

220
00:19:18 --> 00:19:22
it will line up on the metaphase
plate in an orientation which is

221
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
random.  In this particular example,
the big S allele is pointing down

222
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
and the little S allele
is pointing up.  OK?

223
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
Based on that,
let's fix that.

224
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
Based on that there is one of two
possible alignments for the

225
00:19:38 --> 00:19:42
chromosome that carries the other
gene.  In our example it's the Y

226
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
gene.  One orientation would have
the big Y carrying chromosome

227
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
pointing up, but it's just as likely
that that chromosome could end up

228
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
the other way around such that the
big Y carrying chromosome

229
00:19:54 --> 00:19:58
is pointing down.
And it's based on the fact that the

230
00:19:58 --> 00:20:02
two chromosomes are independent of
one another when they choose which

231
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
side of the metaphase plate to go to
that gives us this random assortment

232
00:20:06 --> 00:20:10
in meiosis and the development of
Mendel's Second Law.

233
00:20:10 --> 00:20:15
So if you carry this through then
you generate these gametes in a

234
00:20:15 --> 00:20:19
2:2:2:2 or 1:1:1:1 ratio.
OK?  That's the most important

235
00:20:19 --> 00:20:23
thing.  If you understand that then
you can work it out as to which

236
00:20:23 --> 00:20:27
genotypes you get and which
phenotypes you get using

237
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
Punnett Squares.
OK?  But it's important that you

238
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
understand why it is that you get
random assortment of the alleles in

239
00:20:37 --> 00:20:42
such a cross.  Is that clear to
everybody?  It's probably not clear

240
00:20:42 --> 00:20:47
to the guy reading the newspaper.
Oh, the woman reading the newspaper.

241
00:20:47 --> 00:20:52
Usually it's a guy reading the
newspaper but not today.

242
00:20:52 --> 00:20:58
Is this clear?  Are there any
questions?  OK.

243
00:20:58 --> 00:21:01
As I said, you can work through this
with Punnett Squares.

244
00:21:01 --> 00:21:05
I decided not to do it on the board
because it takes a lot of time,

245
00:21:05 --> 00:21:08
but the book shows you, in this
specific example,

246
00:21:08 --> 00:21:12
what you should expect.
Here are the two parentals.

247
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
They're homozygous for each of the
alleles, big S,

248
00:21:15 --> 00:21:19
big S, big Y, big Y,
little S, little S, little Y,

249
00:21:19 --> 00:21:22
little Y.  In the F1 generation you
create the double heterozygote,

250
00:21:22 --> 00:21:26
big S, little S, big Y, little Y,
and then that generates the four

251
00:21:26 --> 00:21:30
gametes in equal proportion,
as we just discussed.

252
00:21:30 --> 00:21:34
If you cross two of these F1s
together then you can create a

253
00:21:34 --> 00:21:38
Punnett Square which now has 16
squares instead of just four which

254
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
allows us to consider the products
of all four of these gametes crossed

255
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
to all four of these gametes.
So we get various combinations of

256
00:21:46 --> 00:21:50
genotypes and we get various
combinations of phenotypes.

257
00:21:50 --> 00:21:54
And you can calculate what those
are based on looking at this.

258
00:21:54 --> 00:21:58
There's actually another way of
doing it, which I find to be simpler,

259
00:21:58 --> 00:22:02
which is illustrated here.
Again, because the traits and the

260
00:22:02 --> 00:22:07
alleles are segregating from one
another independently you can think

261
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
about this as two Punnett Squares
separately and figure out the

262
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
consequences of those two traits by
simply multiplying between then.

263
00:22:17 --> 00:22:22
So what I mean by that is if you
consider the S allele in isolation

264
00:22:22 --> 00:22:27
then there are the familiar 1:2:1
ratio of the three different

265
00:22:27 --> 00:22:32
genotypes.
And that's true also of the Y

266
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
genotypes, 1:2:1 of the three
possible genotypes.

267
00:22:36 --> 00:22:40
In total there are nine possible
genotypes, but when you separate it

268
00:22:40 --> 00:22:44
from S and Y it's 3:3.
Likewise with respect to the

269
00:22:44 --> 00:22:48
phenotypes, three-quarters of these
guys will be smooth,

270
00:22:48 --> 00:22:52
one-quarter will be wrinkled.
And over here three-quarters will

271
00:22:52 --> 00:22:56
be yellow, one-quarter will be green.
If I want to figure out what the

272
00:22:56 --> 00:23:00
frequency is of any compound
genotype, I just have

273
00:23:00 --> 00:23:03
to multiply across.
So if I want to know the frequency

274
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
of big S, big S,
big Y, big Y, and it's just the

275
00:23:07 --> 00:23:11
product of a quarter times a quarter
or a sixteenth,

276
00:23:11 --> 00:23:14
just like the coins example by the
way.  If I want to know the

277
00:23:14 --> 00:23:18
frequency of being big S,
little S, big Y, little Y,

278
00:23:18 --> 00:23:22
then it's a half times a half or
four-sixteenths,

279
00:23:22 --> 00:23:26
sorry.  A half times a half or a
quarter which equals

280
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
four sixteenths.
And the other genotypes comprise the

281
00:23:30 --> 00:23:34
remaining sixteenths that we see,
another 11.  And likewise with

282
00:23:34 --> 00:23:38
respect to phenotypes.
If you want to know the frequency

283
00:23:38 --> 00:23:42
of smooth yellow offspring you just
multiple across,

284
00:23:42 --> 00:23:47
three-quarters times three-quarters
gives you nine-sixteenth.

285
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
Of wrinkled green ones it's a
quarter times a quarter or

286
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
one-sixteenth.
So, again, when you're asked to do

287
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
Punnett Squares for two traits that
segregate independently,

288
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
you might think about doing it using
separate Punnett Squares.

289
00:24:04 --> 00:24:10
OK.  So we've talked about Mendel's
Laws.  We're wrapping up Mendel's

290
00:24:10 --> 00:24:16
Laws here.  The first law is
independent segregation of the two

291
00:24:16 --> 00:24:22
alleles.  The second law with
respect to different genes,

292
00:24:22 --> 00:24:29
they segregate independently from
each other.  OK?

293
00:24:29 --> 00:24:32
Now, as I said,
this is true for genes that are on

294
00:24:32 --> 00:24:36
different chromosomes or actually
genes that are far away on the same

295
00:24:36 --> 00:24:39
chromosome, but it's not always true.
And to emphasize that point we're

296
00:24:39 --> 00:24:43
going to return to
our coin friends.

297
00:24:43 --> 00:24:52
So let me just remind you,

298
00:24:52 --> 00:24:56
let me just remind you what we saw.
So this doesn't apply to genes that

299
00:24:56 --> 00:25:00
are linked together on
the same chromosome.

300
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
Let's remind you what we determined
for genes that are unlinked,

301
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
the dime and the penny.  We said
that the frequency of getting in my

302
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
left hand head,
head and in my right hand head,

303
00:25:12 --> 00:25:17
head, and together was 1:4 and 1:4
and together was 1:16.

304
00:25:17 --> 00:25:21
That was the situation when they
were independent of one another.

305
00:25:21 --> 00:25:25
But let's consider the situation
when I've taped them together.

306
00:25:25 --> 00:25:30
Now I have a penny and a quarter
which are taped together.

307
00:25:30 --> 00:25:35
I have fixed the orientation of
these two coins with respect to one

308
00:25:35 --> 00:25:40
another.  So you can see the heads
are on the same side,

309
00:25:40 --> 00:25:46
the heads are on the same side,
yeah?  OK.  What's the likelihood

310
00:25:46 --> 00:25:51
that this is going to have the penny
in the head configuration?

311
00:25:51 --> 00:25:57
1:2.  And if it is what's the
likelihood that the quarter is going

312
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
to be in the head configuration?
One.  So what's the likelihood that

313
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06
the coin is going to have head,
head when I turned it up?  1:2.  Not

314
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
like this example.
1:2.  And so what's the likelihood

315
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
that it's going to be head,
head in this configuration, in this

316
00:26:14 --> 00:26:18
hand?  1:2.  So what's the
likelihood that it's going to be

317
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
head, head, head,
head?  1:4.  So the frequencies

318
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
don't work out,
according to Mendel's Rules,

319
00:26:26 --> 00:26:31
if the two genes are linked, the two
genes are linked together.

320
00:26:31 --> 00:26:35
So thank you for your help.
It pays to sit in the front row

321
00:26:35 --> 00:26:40
every once in a while.
So this is what we just talked

322
00:26:40 --> 00:26:45
about.  In my left hand the
frequency of head,

323
00:26:45 --> 00:26:50
head was one-half, in my right hand
frequency of head,

324
00:26:50 --> 00:26:54
head was one-half, so the product
was a half times a half or a quarter.

325
00:26:54 --> 00:26:59
OK?  Now, if we want to think about
that is sort of genetic terms,

326
00:26:59 --> 00:27:03
let's think about chromosomes.
And genes can be linked on

327
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
chromosomes like those two coins can
be linked together by tape.

328
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
So here are two genes, the penny
gene and the quarter gene,

329
00:27:10 --> 00:27:13
two alleles, the head allele and the
tail allele, and they're present on

330
00:27:13 --> 00:27:16
two chromosomes in a heterozygous
individual.  And they're in this

331
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
configuration such that the head
allele of the quarter is next to the

332
00:27:20 --> 00:27:23
head allele of the penny.
The tail allele of the quarter is

333
00:27:23 --> 00:27:27
next to the tail allele
of the penny.

334
00:27:27 --> 00:27:31
When this goes through meiosis the
alleles stick together.

335
00:27:31 --> 00:27:36
The head alleles stick together in
the gametes.  The tail alleles stick

336
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
together in the gametes.
It's just like Mary Had a Little

337
00:27:40 --> 00:27:45
Lamb.  Remember that one?
I'm getting curious looks.

338
00:27:45 --> 00:27:49
Mary had a little lamb.  Its fleece
was white as snow.

339
00:27:49 --> 00:27:54
Everywhere that Mary went the lamb
was sure to go.

340
00:27:54 --> 00:27:59
A long way to go for that one,
but anyway.

341
00:27:59 --> 00:28:03
Everywhere that Mary went the lamb
was sure to go.

342
00:28:03 --> 00:28:07
They stay linked.
OK?  And importantly you don't find,

343
00:28:07 --> 00:28:12
or you almost never find this
situation where the quarter in the

344
00:28:12 --> 00:28:16
head, sorry, the penny in the head
configuration went with the quarter

345
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
in the tail configuration.
You don't find those, or you almost

346
00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
never, and this is the point of the
final phase of the lecture.

347
00:28:25 --> 00:28:43
OK.  Very good.

348
00:28:43 --> 00:28:49
So let's look at this with respect
to peas.  Why not?

349
00:28:49 --> 00:28:56
We're going to talk about now
linked genes in peas.

350
00:28:56 --> 00:29:03
We're going to talk about two genes.

351
00:29:03 --> 00:29:08
We're going to have our familiar Y
gene which has its two alleles.

352
00:29:08 --> 00:29:13
And now we're going to talk about a
new gene, the D gene,

353
00:29:13 --> 00:29:18
which likewise has two alleles and
two phenotypes which are dense peas

354
00:29:18 --> 00:29:24
and light peas.
OK?  Dense peas and light peas.

355
00:29:24 --> 00:29:29
And it turns out that these two
genes are on the same chromosome and

356
00:29:29 --> 00:29:35
very close to one another.
So if you think about the

357
00:29:35 --> 00:29:43
chromosomes in a heterozygous
individual, double heterozygous

358
00:29:43 --> 00:29:50
individual they would look like that.
If we think about the chromosomes

359
00:29:50 --> 00:29:58
in a tester strain,
which is homozygous for the

360
00:29:58 --> 00:30:08
recessive alleles for both.

361
00:30:08 --> 00:30:15
What's going to happen to the
offspring?  What?

362
00:30:15 --> 00:30:22
What?  I'm sorry.
First of all, this phenotype is

363
00:30:22 --> 00:30:29
yellow and dense.
Big D is dominant over little D.

364
00:30:29 --> 00:30:35
This phenotype is green and light.
OK?  What do the gametes look like

365
00:30:35 --> 00:30:39
in this Punnett Square?
And why am I drawing four boxes,

366
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
only four boxes anyway?  Didn't I
tell you a little while ago that if

367
00:30:43 --> 00:30:47
you have two alleles,
two genes you have to draw a Punnett

368
00:30:47 --> 00:30:51
Square with 16 boxes?
Why am I drawing only four?

369
00:30:51 --> 00:30:55
Because they go together.  They're
linked.  So what do the

370
00:30:55 --> 00:31:02
alleles look like?
Well, this parent is going to give

371
00:31:02 --> 00:31:10
either big Y, big D or little Y,
little D.  And this parent is always

372
00:31:10 --> 00:31:18
only ever going to give little Y,
little D.  OK?  So therefore the

373
00:31:18 --> 00:31:33
genotype follows, sorry.

374
00:31:33 --> 00:31:41
And the phenotype.
What am I going to get when I

375
00:31:41 --> 00:31:49
deconvolute this?
What am I going to get?

376
00:31:49 --> 00:31:57
The phenotype in that cross,
50% will be yellow dense.  And 50%

377
00:31:57 --> 00:32:04
will be what?  Green and light.
The very same two phenotypes that I

378
00:32:04 --> 00:32:10
got in the parents.
These are the parental phenotypes.

379
00:32:10 --> 00:32:23
And in a test cross like this,

380
00:32:23 --> 00:32:27
of two genes that are very tightly
linked, you would always regenerate

381
00:32:27 --> 00:32:32
the parental phenotypes.
They would never separate from one

382
00:32:32 --> 00:32:35
another.  You'd always only ever
generate the parental --
