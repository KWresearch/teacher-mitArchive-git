<p> </p> <p>And he took what was left, which much be very, very small, smaller  than the size of a cell because the cells were removed by filtration,  and he injected it into another bird. Now, a healthy bird.</p> <p>And strikingly that bird developed a tumor.</p> <p>So he was able to transfer whatever agent it was that was associated  with tumor development from this bird to this bird. He concluded that it  was something smaller than a cell, and he concluded that it was a  virus.</p> <p>And indeed he was right. Now, the tumor that these birds developed is called a sarcoma.</p> <p>It's a tumor of the muscle in this case. And the virus that was  responsible for this tumor was named after Rous, and it goes by the name  of Rous sarcoma virus or RSV.</p> <p>Now, there was great skepticism about the connections between viruses  and cancer at that time, and actually for many decades thereafter. And  so Rous' work was not fully appreciated for some time.</p> <p>But it was eventually appreciated.</p> <p>And Rous actually won the Nobel Prize 50 years after he made this  discovery, when it was confirmed that indeed the stuff that he was  studying was highly relevant to the situation in humans. Not analogous,  necessarily, but highly relevant.</p> <p>Over the years, since that discovery and discoveries made by others,  demonstrated that the Rous sarcoma virus viral genome carried a set of  genes that were familiar.</p> <p>These are the same sorts of genes carried by many viruses of this class.</p> <p>Rous sarcoma virus happens to be a retrovirus. I'll teach you more  about those in a future lecture. It's the same general class that  includes HIV. And there were some familiar genes that were responsible  for the replication functions of the virus.</p> <p>But then there was a new gene present in this strain of the virus,  specific to Rous sarcoma virus, which was named Src and was later  considered to be the relevant oncogene, the gene that was responsible  for the tumor forming capabilities of this Rous sarcoma virus.</p> <p>So there was then great interest in what was this Src gene? What was  this special gene that could cause normal cells to become cancer cells?</p> <p>And research then went on for, again, a number of years studying Src,  studying its biochemical functions, but the real question that was of  great interest over the years was where did Src come from?</p> <p>Most viruses in this class don't carry Src, and it wasn't at all clear what the origins of this cancer-causing gene were.</p> <p>Was it a rare viral gene or perhaps did it come from the host cells themselves?</p> <p>And in experiments that were done, actually by my PhD advisor, Harold  Varmus and his colleague Mike Bishop, it was shown that the Src gene  actually does indeed reside in the cells of the host and gets picked up  by a recombination process by the virus.</p> <p>And I'll just illustrate that for you. It turns out that there's a  related virus fairly common in chickens called avian leukosis virus.</p> <p>And this is the predecessor of Rous sarcoma virus. It's a virus that has in its genome just the replication genes.</p> <p>And I'll just draw a viral capsid around this virus. So this is the  avian leukosis virus with its genome and replication genes. Now, what  they showed was that the avian leukosis virus, when it infects cells,  here's a normal chicken cell.</p> <p>Most of the time it just makes more copies of itself like viruses will do.</p> <p>But occasionally, through a recombination mechanism, the avian  leukosis virus will actually pick up a gene which is present in the  normal genome of the chicken, a gene which looks very much like the Src  gene present in Rous sarcoma virus.</p> <p>And through this recombination mechanism, the details of which I  won't go through, very rarely you'll get a recombinant virus produced  which has in its genome the replication genes, but now also Src gene.</p> <p>And this virus, which modifies the Src gene slightly in the course of  the development of the virus, now, when introduced into birds, will  very efficiently cause tumors.</p> <p>And what this showed, what this actually Nobel Prize winning  experiment showed was that the oncogene, powerful cancer-causing gene  resides in the DNA of the chicken.</p> <p>And actually there were similar genes, very analogous genes residing in the DNA of all vertebrate species, including humans.</p> <p>You are sitting there with two copies of the Src gene inside of you.  So a question is, if that's true, if we all have these oncogenes in our  cells why don't we get cancer? Why aren't we all sitting there as one  large sarcoma? Anybody? Well, there are two answers.</p> <p>Yeah? Somebody.</p> <p>Claudette is pointing to somebody. Am I blind? Oh, hi. Excellent.  Yes. So what's different about the situation in the chicken cell and the  situation in the viral genome is how the gene is expressed.</p> <p>Here it might be expressed properly under what we would call  physiological control, express where it's supposed to be when it's  supposed to be. And here it's been removed from that regulatory network  and is expressed perhaps at two high levels at the wrong time.</p> <p>And under those conditions it can push cells to inappropriately divide.</p> <p>So the virus has hijacked this gene and changes its regulation.  That's one explanation. There's potentially another explanation for why  we're not all sitting around with tumors, and I'll come to that in a  moment.</p> <p>Now, as I said, Varmus and Bishop won the Nobel Prize for this work  in 1989. And the day that they won the Nobel Prize Harold Varmus'  sister-in-law was standing in a cafeteria line at Berkeley and she  overheard two guys talking behind her.</p> <p>One guy said to the other, what are you going to have for lunch? And  the other guy said, I don't know but it ain't going to be the chicken  because two guys just won the Nobel Prize for showing that chicken  causes cancer.</p> <p>[LAUGHTER] Which is not exactly true. But nevertheless. Now we know  since that work that there are a large number of these viruses which are  called collectively acutely transforming viruses.</p> <p>There are a large number of acutely transforming viruses that carry  in their genomes and oncogene which they have cooperated from the host  cell.</p> <p>These viruses are not viruses of human beings. They're viruses of  experimental animals and usually generated in an experimental setting.  Mice, rats, chickens, turkeys, other species have been used to generate  such viruses.</p> <p>And about 50 or so oncogenes have been discovered through this  context, including one that's hopefully familiar to you already and will  come again, members of the Ras gene family which I've told you about as  an important signaling molecule in mitogenic signaling pathways, and  another important oncogene that I'll mention briefly later called mic,  and about 50 more.</p> <p>And it turns out that they were a very useful source to identify cancer-associated genes in humans.</p> <p>Many of the genes that we now know are important in human cancer were initially discovered through that process.</p> <p>Now, as I said, most of the time human cancer has nothing to do with  viruses so don't be confused. There are a few human cancers that are  virally associated. The major one is cervical cancer.</p> <p>About 50% of cervical cancers, particularly in the Developing World,  are associated with the virus called human papillomavirus or HPV, and  specifically the high-risk types.</p> <p>Not all papillomaviruses will cause cancer. Papillomavirus is the  same virus that causes warts, for example. And there are many  papillomaviruses that are not associated with true malignancies, but  human papillomaviruses of the high-risk type are.</p> <p>And they can give rise to cervical cancer.</p> <p>Fortunately, companies are now developing vaccines against HPVs which  are greatly affecting the risk of cervical cancer around the world. So  this is a major step forward in controlling this particular cancer type.</p> <p>So because most human cancers are not virally associated, there was  still some skepticism about the importance of this discovery for human  cancer. Maybe it was true of the viruses, maybe it was true of these  experimental animals, but is it true of human beings?</p> <p>Do these oncogenes have anything to do with human cancer? And this  debate went on for a little while longer until Bob Weinberg here at MIT  in about 1980 did the following experiment.</p> <p>He took DNA not from a bird but from a human being who carried a tumor in his bladder.</p> <p>So this individual had bladder cancer. This cancer was put into cell  culture and turned into a cancer cell line, and it was actually this  material that Weinberg's lab worked with. And they asked the question,  are there genes in the cancer cell line that are cancer-causing?</p> <p>Are there oncogenes that I can discover within those cancer cells? So  the experiment that they did was to take DNA, they isolated DNA from  the cancer cells, and they introduced it into mouse cells in the  laboratory that were "normal".</p> <p>And what I mean by that is they looked pretty normal compared to the  cancer cells which had a deranged sort of architecture, as I mentioned  last time.</p> <p>They grew flat and didn't grow on top of each other like cancer cells will do.</p> <p>And, importantly, if you were to inject these cells into an  immunocompromised mouse they wouldn't form a tumor. They were  nontumorigenic. Whereas, these cells, if injected into a mouse, would  form tumors.</p> <p>OK? So they isolated DNA from the cancer cells and put it on the mouse cells.</p> <p>The mouse cells will, at some frequency, take up the DNA, incorporate  the human DNA into their own genomes and begin to express the genes  from the human DNA.</p> <p>And they found at low frequency that within this population of  otherwise normal-looking mouse cells abnormal colonies of "transformed"  cells could be found.</p> <p>And these transformed cells looked a lot like the cancer cells.</p> <p>Their shape was different, they grew on top of one another, and they  had other properties that also made them similar to cancer cells in the  sense that if they injected these cells into an immunocompromised  animal, whereas the normal cells would not form a tumor, these  transformed cells would.</p> <p>So they were able to convert normal cells into cancer cells through the addition of DNA from a cancer cell line.</p> <p>So what's going on here? What did they do in this experiment? Yeah. They eventually did.</p> <p>To get to that point they were able to isolate from the full genome  of the cancer cell an individual gene that had been transferred into  these mouse cells. They isolated that human gene away from the mouse  genes, and then they preformed DNA sequencing.</p> <p>And they discovered the first human oncogene that was isolated from a cancer as opposed to a virus.</p> <p>And, as I alluded to last time, the gene that they isolated in this  fashion was a familiar one. It was the Ras gene, a gene that had been  discovered in the context of acutely transforming retroviruses.</p> <p>It was already known to be cancer-associated, but now it's in the context of real human cancer. And this was a major advance.</p> <p>Moreover, they sequenced the Ras gene from the cancer and compared it  to the sequence of the Ras gene from normal cells and they found a  difference.</p> <p>They found that it had been mutated, just as the genetic theory of  cancer would predict. Compared to the normal sequence of the Ras gene,  which is shown above, the sequence of the Ras gene isolated from the  human bladder cancer sample carried a single mutation which converted a  glycine amino acid to a valine amino acid.</p> <p>And the consequence of that mutation changed the Ras protein from  being a signaling molecule that could be regulated from an on state to  an off state to a signaling molecule that could not be regulated.</p> <p>Once it go turned on it couldn't' get turned off. So it was a  constitutively active signaling molecule, which makes sense for a cancer  cell that is continually proliferating.</p> <p>Now, there's an issue here that I would like you to ponder.</p> <p>And that is that this is a single point mutation, a single base  change. In all of your cells, during cell division, there's a particular  mutation rate. It's not known exactly, at least for all cells in your  body what that rate is.</p> <p>But let's estimate that it's about ten to the minus ninth per base pair per cell division.</p> <p>Now, if you calculate how many cell divisions are going on in your  body at any given time, you can estimate that you have about ten to the  third to ten to the fifth Ras mutant cells inside you as you sit there  today.</p> <p>Maybe as many 100,000. Maybe more than a million cells that carry that very mutation in your bodies.</p> <p>So I ask you again, why is it that you don't all have tumors? This  time it's not the explanation that we heard before about regulation  because this is the native gene which is being changed.</p> <p>It's being regulated the same way. So why is it that we don't all  have bladder cancer, for example, or some other type of tumor? Well, it  relates to what I told you last time, that cancer is rarely a  single-step event.</p> <p>Cancers rarely are associated with a single mutation. A single  mutation may be involved, may be involved in initiation, but it's not  sufficient to give you all the steps you need for a full cancer.</p> <p>As I mentioned last time, you might need five, ten or twenty distinct  mutations to get a true cancer. So you might have mutant cells in you,  they might be totally normal, but if layered on top of those mutations  are other mutations they could progress.</p> <p>OK?</p> <p>Now, that's particularly important because the mutations that we're  talking about are, at least by some assays, dominant. And the old  genetics terminology of dominant and recessive, these mutations are  dominant.</p> <p>Note, in this assay we're transferring a single gene into an  otherwise normal cell and seeing a phenotype. That's an example of  dominance. And these genes can, in the right context, function in a  dominant fashion on top of a normal copy or normal copies of the gene.</p> <p>And you'll see why a distinction between dominant and recessive is important in a moment.</p> <p>Now, as I hope you remember from earlier lectures about signal  transduction, the Ras proteins fall within a signal transduction pathway  that's very well worked out. They link transmembrane growth factor  receptors through intermediary proteins, adaptors and exchange factors,  to downstream components involved in, for example, phosphorylation  kinases and transcription factors that turn on the expression of target  genes.</p> <p>This is the pathway that I've illustrated to you before.</p> <p>And we now know that many of the components of this pathway, this  so-called mitogenic signaling pathway that drives cells to divide are  mutated in cancers. Not just Ras, which is actually mutated at pretty  high frequency in cancers, but many of these components are mutated as  well.</p> <p>And they're mutated through different mechanisms.</p> <p>Subtle mutations, like I've just told you about for Ras, where single  nucleotides can be changed and a single amino acid can be changed to  convert a normally regulated protein into an abnormally regulated  protein like Ras.</p> <p>Some of the growth factor receptors are likewise activated by that  mechanism. But there are other mechanisms, other activation mechanisms  for cancer-associated genes, including gene amplification and  translocation which I'll illustrate on the board.</p> <p>I hope you noticed on the right here, Review Sessions for Monday  night for the exam on Wednesday, as well as Tutoring Sessions and  indications of where you're supposed to go.</p> <p>So gene amplification is important in cancer. There are quite a few genes that are amplified in tumors compared to normal cells.</p> <p>And I'll give you one example which is relevant to breast cancer and ovarian cancer.</p> <p>In normal cells, in the DNA of normal cells there's a gene called  HER2 which is one of these growth factor receptors like number two up  there. And of course the normal cells are diploid so they have two  copies of the HER2 gene.</p> <p>And through normal transcription and translation that's going to give  rise to a particular concentration of the growth factor receptor on the  surface of the cells.</p> <p>And that's going to give rise to a certain signal emanating from that  growth factor receptor which will cause the cells to divide at the  appropriate time and place.</p> <p>In about 30% of breast cancers and a similar percentage of ovarian  cancers, the number of copies of the HER2 gene has been increased  dramatically, sometimes as much as a hundred fold.</p> <p>And these are due to errors in DNA replication. Instead of having DNA  copied once in this region, it gets copied again and again and again  and again.</p> <p>And now, in these cancer cells, you don't have that same concentration of the growth factor receptor.</p> <p>You have a much higher concentration of the receptor. And because  there's a much higher concentration of the receptor, you might get as  much as ten or a hundred times the level of signaling. And the  consequences of this are that a cell that shouldn't divide doesn't have  actually enough concentration of growth factors where it should normally  divide will now divide anyway.</p> <p>Inappropriate proliferation, the hallmark of cancer.</p> <p>Now, the good news here is that there are antibodies against this  HER2 protein. And they are actually effective in the treatment of breast  cancer. They can prolong the life of women with breast cancer,  specifically those who have amplifications of this gene.</p> <p>This drug actually does nothing for women who don't have amplifications, but it prolongs the life of women who do.</p> <p>So that's an important link between basic biology and treatment. We'll talk more about those next time.</p> <p>Another mechanism of activation of oncogenes is translocation.</p> <p>I showed you last time karyotypes of cancer cells in which one piece  of one chromosome gets linked to a piece of a different chromosome.</p> <p>The reason that happens and is selected for is that new regulatory  networks or new genes can be produced by those kinds of break and  joining reactions.</p> <p>And one famous one involves this gene called myc which is a  transcription factor like the bottom of this pathway, like number eight  there, transcription factor which is important in driving cells into the  cell cycle.</p> <p>myc is normally expressed from a "weak promoter".</p> <p>Which means that not a whole lot of myc mRNA is produced, which means  that not that much myc protein is produced at any given time in a cell.  And this gives rise to regulated cell division.</p> <p>However, occasionally in cancers, particularly in certain types of  leukemia and lymphoma, translocation events take place where a new  segment of DNA is produced which joins the normal myc gene to a very  strong promoter.</p> <p>And now, just like this gentlemen mentioned before about the RSV, now a gene is not regulated properly.</p> <p>It's now regulated, in this case, too strongly.</p> <p>So a lot of myc mRNA is produced which gives rise to a lot of myc protein which gives rise to unregulated cell growth. </p> <p>Again, the hallmark of cancer.</p> <p>So the DNA of tumor cells changes by point mutations, by gene  amplifications, by translocations, as well as by gene deletions, which I  haven't shown you but also occur.</p> <p>And together these mutations are found in virtually all human cancers.</p> <p>Sometimes RAS, sometimes in growth factor receptor, sometimes in  transcription factor, but one place or another you would typically find a  mutation in this pathway. So signaling proliferation is key to tumor  development.</p> <p>And that's not too surprising given how we think about how cancers  arise. But these oncogenes, these positive regulators of tumorogenesis  are not the only genes that are important.</p> <p>Normal cells do, in fact, use these signals.</p> <p>And I've equated them with like the gas peddle on your car, go  signals, which cause normal cells to divide when it's appropriate to  divide during development or injury repair or cell replenishment. But  there's another class of genes that turns on when it's appropriate for  cells to stop dividing.</p> <p>So these genes are the equivalent of the stop signals which would impose themselves when cell division should cease.</p> <p>Now, oncogenes promote cell division. Too much oncogene product, a  mutant oncogene product will cause normal cells to divide too often.</p> <p>But in addition to those we find mutations in the stop signals, the  signals that would normally halt proliferation. And this allows an even  greater accumulation of cells. The go signals are the equivalent of  oncogene mutations and the stop mutations are the equivalent of another  class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes.</p> <p>Tumor suppressor genes have been known for about 20 years now.</p> <p>And the first one comes from this tumor here. This is a child with a  tumor called retinoblastoma. It's a tumor of the retina. It's actually  really rare.</p> <p>It occurs in about one in 40,000 births in the general population,  but there are individuals who are familialy predisposed to  retinoblastoma.</p> <p>And in these kids 90% of the time they will develop retinoblastoma  actually affecting both eyes. So can be actually a fairly common and  severe disease in that sense.</p> <p>This gene, the gene responsible for retinoblastoma was cloned, again in Bob Weinberg's lab several years ago.</p> <p>And we now know that it's an important cell cycle regulator, as is  indicated here. So the retinoblastoma gene encodes a retinoblastoma  protein. The retinoblastoma protein is called pRB. And, as is  illustrated on this slide, the RB protein is a negative regulator of the  cell cycle.</p> <p>As you recall, cells normally cycle from M phase to G1/S phase through again.</p> <p>And the RB protein acts normally to restrain cell division. It blocks  cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle when it's active. When cells  receive signals from growth factor pathways they inactivate the RB gene  through phosphorylation, the RB protein through phosphorylation.</p> <p>And this occurs by cyclin-CDK complexes, which I told you about in the cell cycle lectures.</p> <p>There are actually two different cyclin-CDK proteins which  phosphorylate RB and inactivate it. So when you need to divide you  inactive this brake on the cell cycle and the cells can divide. When you  need to stop dividing you activate certain growth inhibitory pathways  that inhibit the kinases that block the phosphorylation of RB so RB  stays in its active state.</p> <p>And now the cells cannot divide anymore.</p> <p>So RB is a molecular brake on the cell cycle. RB mutations, and  mutations in other components of this pathway occur in about 90% of  human tumors. It's a very, very commonly affected pathway in tumor  development.</p> <p>What kind of mutations would you expect to see in the RB gene in  human cancer? Would you expect to see gene amplifications,  translocations that cause too much of the RB protein to be produced?</p> <p>Does that sound right? Remember, it's a brake.</p> <p>So what kinds of mutations do you expect to find? Nonsense mutations. Or more generally inactivating mutations.</p> <p>Nonsense mutations. Maybe deletions which would remove the gene all  together. Now, are these mutations dominant or recessive? Inactivating  mutations are recessive.</p> <p>So what's going on here? We all have two copies of the RB gene, and  yet we're saying that the mutations that take place in this gene are  loss of function mutations, inactivating mutations.</p> <p>So how is it that you ever find RB mutations in cancer?</p> <p>Well, the answer is that one mutation is not enough. One mutation of  one copy of the RB gene is not enough. For tumor suppressor genes were  the mutations are recessive, you need two hits.</p> <p>Two mutational events are required to now fully deprive the cell of the brake.</p> <p>One mutation is not enough. And this is now known in the field as the  two-hit model of tumor development, at least for tumor suppressor  genes. And it's illustrated here.</p> <p>Because we carry two copies of all of our genes, two mutational  events are required to eliminate the function of a tumor suppressor  gene.</p> <p>And this is what it looks like. If this is a normal cell which has  two normal copies of the RB gene, the first thing to happen is that one  copy of the RB gene incurs a mutation. It might be a nonsense mutation  or a deletion, but whatever it is it eliminates the function of the RB  gene.</p> <p>But this cell itself is normal because it still has one normal copy of the RB gene and this is a recessive mutation.</p> <p>So this cell here is actually normal, but it's one step away from lacking the RB gene all together.</p> <p>And there are a number of ways that that second copy of the gene can  be lost. And they're illustrated by these different arrows. The simplest  thing to think about is that that second copy of the RB gene picks up  its own mutation.</p> <p>We call that a de novo mutation.</p> <p>And now you have a cell which has two independently mutated copies of  RB, and that's a cell that now has lost control of proliferation. But  there are other mechanisms, which are illustrated here, where the second  copy of the RB gene is actually lost all together because the  chromosome that carries that gene is itself lost giving rise to a cell  that only has one copy of the chromosome.</p> <p>And it's the one that has the mutant RB gene.</p> <p>Or there's a recombination event which replaces the good copy of the  RB gene with the bad copy of the RB gene giving rise to a cell that is  lacking functional RB once again.</p> <p>And this term here is called loss of heterozygosity or LOH.</p> <p>And it's a hallmark of tumor suppressor gene mutations. It's an  indication that there's a tumor suppressor gene mutation in the region.</p> <p>It's usually detected not by a change in the tumor suppressor gene  itself but rather by some linked polymorphic marker like a SNP which is  close by to the RB gene or whatever tumor suppressor gene it is.</p> <p>This individual has a big A, little A, and therefore is heterozygous.</p> <p>He or she is heterozygous, big A, little A. But if you notice in the  tumors, if the tumors arise by chromosome loss or by mitotic  recombination, the individual has lost the little A allele.</p> <p>Either there's only big A or there are two copies of big A, in which  case we've seen loss of heterozygosity, LOH. And that's a common feature  of tumor suppressor gene mutations. And I suspect you'll hear about it  in problem sets and beyond.</p> <p>So LOH is an important mechanism which allows us to go from one hit to two hits.</p> <p>OK. Now, RB is not the only tumor suppressor gene that's mutated in  cancer. And proliferation is not the only process that affected in  tumorigenesis. As I told you, at the end of the day in cancer we care  about how many cells we have.</p> <p>And you can have too many cells by increasing proliferation.</p> <p>And the RAS mutations and RB loss are examples of how you can have  too much proliferation. But you can also have too little cell death.</p> <p>And we actually have examples of both oncogenes, which are activated  to prevent cell death, and tumor suppressor genes that are lost to  prevent cell death. So let me tell you a little bit about those.</p> <p>The first gene that was associated with apoptosis and cancer was this gene called Bcl2.</p> <p>It's related to one of the first apoptosis genes discovered in the  Horvitz lab here at MIT, and it's involved in regulating caspases.  You've probably forgotten by now but caspases are proteases that are  kept normally inside your cells in an inactive state.</p> <p>And they get activated by cell death signals.</p> <p>Signals that would trigger the cells to commit apoptosis which causes the caspases to become active.</p> <p>And this then leads to the program of cell death.</p> <p>The Bcl2 gene functions to block, downstream of the death signals,  the activation of caspases. Is Bcl2 an oncogene or a tumor suppressor  gene?</p> <p>Does it get activated during cancer or inactivated during cancer? Activated.</p> <p>You want to suppress cell death in tumorigenesis. And Bcl2 does that,  so Bcl2 gets activated. It's an oncogene. And it's typically activated  by translocation, in the cases where it is involved.</p> <p>Translocation, like with myc, too much Bcl2, inappropriate cell survival.</p> <p>Another very important gene in tumorigenesis that regulates apoptosis is p53.</p> <p>p53 is actually the most commonly affected gene in all human cancer. 50% of all tumors --</p> <p>-- carry p53 mutations.</p> <p>That's a remarkable number. And p53, we now know, is an important  regulator of apoptosis. It doesn't *only* regulate apoptosis but it is  an important regulator of apoptosis.</p> <p>p53 is like a molecular policeman inside your cells.</p> <p>It's present at very low levels normally, and it's responsive to  various stress signals. When cells get stressed, for example when their  DNA gets damaged or they recognize that they're proliferating abnormally  or they're starved of oxygen, the levels of p53 protein go way up.</p> <p>And when that happens the cells either arrest to try to repair the  damage or they will commit suicide killing themselves so they cannot go  on to become life-threatening tumors.</p> <p>So is p53 an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene? Is it activated in cancer or inactivated in cancer? Inactivated.</p> <p>It's a tumor suppressor gene. Cancer cells don't want to die so they get rid of p53 to prevent the death.</p> <p>So p53 is a tumor suppressor gene and a very frequently mutated one in human cancers. You can study p53 in a variety of ways.</p> <p>My lab has been studying it for a dozen years using mice that carry  mutations in p53 that were generated by gene targeting technology. You  don't need to know the details of this, but suffice to say it's possible  to create mice which are either heterozygous for a p53 mutation or  homozygous for a p53 mutation.</p> <p>And the question we asked in those experiments is would these  heterozygous mutant mice or homozygous mutant mice be cancer prone?  Should they be? Would you expect an animal that's lacking p53, one copy  or both, to be cancer prone? It's a tumor suppressor gene so, yeah,  absolutely.</p> <p>And sure enough it is.</p> <p>If you look at a population of mice and plot their percent survival  as a function of time, one year, two years, three years, mice live about  three years, normal mice with two copies of p53 will live a normal  lifespan.</p> <p>Mice that have one functional copy of p53 die sooner. They live about a year and a half.</p> <p>And if you look in the tumors of these mice, the normal copy of p53  is missing, which is the prediction of the two-hit model of  tumorigenesis.</p> <p>You need to get rid of both copies. And p53 minus-minus mice only  make it about four to six months and die from cancer. So p53 is an  incredibly important tumor suppressor gene.</p> <p>If you're mutated in it, your risk of getting cancer goes way, way up.</p> <p>OK. Now, in the last five minutes I just want to mention the fact that cancer, while typically a sporadic disease --</p> <p>-- by which I mean there's no family history --</p> <p>-- about 5% of the time there's familial predisposition.</p> <p>Cancer gets passed through the family, through the generations.</p> <p>And you can see that in this pedigree here. This is actually a  pedigree of familial retinoblastoma. The individuals who inherit the  mutant copy of the gene most of the time will develop the tumor, and  they'll pass along that predisposition to their children.</p> <p>If you were to look at this pedigree for a while, you would see that  it looks like an autosomal dominant pedigree, if you remember back to  that portion of the course.</p> <p>If you inherit the mutation, you have a high likelihood of developing  the tumor. And it doesn't matter whether the mutation is coming from  your mother or father or whether you're a boy or a girl. What's  surprising, despite that fact, is that most familial cancer syndromes  like that one are caused by tumor suppressor gene mutations.</p> <p>So what's being passed through the generations here is a mutant copy  of a tumor suppressor gene, the RB gene, or the breast cancer  susceptibility gene, or colon cancer susceptibility gene.</p> <p>A loss of function copy of that gene such that these individuals who  are developing cancer and passing the mutation onto their kids are  heterozygotes.</p> <p>And, as you think about it, you have to wonder why are they cancer  prone? Most of their cells should be normal because most of their cells  are heterozygous for the mutation.</p> <p>But, importantly, those cells are one step away from mutating the other copy of the gene.</p> <p>In contrast to the general population, it carries two normal copies  of the tumor suppressor gene. And in whose cells two mutational events  have to happen in succession to mutate the first copy and then the  second copy.</p> <p>In these people all of their cells carry the first mutation. They're only one mutational event away.</p> <p>And the likelihood that that will happen in the retinas of their eyes  or in the developing breast or colon is sufficiently high that there is  a near certainty that they will develop cancer.</p> <p>OK? So what event must happen during tumor development? A mutation in  the second copy of the gene, one of these LOH events or a second de  novo mutation. I also wonder what might explain the fact that this  gentleman here, who must have the mutation because he passed it onto his  sons, did not himself develop the tumor.</p> <p>Why is that? What's going on in that guy? Excellent.</p> <p>That's exactly the way I phrase it, he was lucky. In his developing  retina by chance no cell underwent the second hit, and so his cells were  just like normal and he developed normally, but he still passed the  mutation onto his children and they weren't so lucky.</p> <p>And, finally, what would happen if two individuals who were  heterozygous produced a homozygous mutant offspring? What do you think  would happen in those individuals? Well, if they survive they should be  mighty cancer prone because no mutational event is required to eliminate  the function in them.</p> <p>They might look like these p53 minus-minus mice.</p> <p>In fact, most tumor suppressor genes are required for normal  development. So you cannot do that experiment. The embryo would never  survive because the gene is important for proliferation control all over  the place.</p> <p>So the embryo doesn't make it. So most of the time you cannot do that  experiment. And, finally, I'd mentioned last time and I just want to  emphasize that the genes that we've focused on for you in this class are  genes that involve proliferation control and cell death.</p> <p>And we'd mentioned briefly DNA damage control.</p> <p>But there are many other processes that are important in  tumorigenesis that are responsive to mutations in other kinds of genes  like the process of invasion and angiogenesis and the all important  process of metastasis.</p> <p>So I'll stop there.</p>
