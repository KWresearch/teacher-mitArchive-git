1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
And he took what was left,
which much be very, very small,

2
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
smaller than the size of a cell
because the cells were removed by

3
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
filtration, and he injected it into
another bird.  Now, a healthy bird.

4
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
And strikingly that bird developed a
tumor.  So he was able to transfer

5
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
whatever agent it was that was
associated with tumor development

6
00:00:40 --> 00:00:46
from this bird to this bird.
He concluded that it was something

7
00:00:46 --> 00:00:51
smaller than a cell,
and he concluded that it was a virus.

8
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
And indeed he was right.
Now, the tumor that these birds

9
00:00:57 --> 00:01:02
developed is called a sarcoma.
It's a tumor of the muscle in this

10
00:01:02 --> 00:01:07
case.  And the virus that was
responsible for this tumor was named

11
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
after Rous, and it goes by the name
of Rous sarcoma virus or RSV.

12
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
Now, there was great skepticism
about the connections between

13
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
viruses and cancer at that time,
and actually for many decades

14
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
thereafter.  And so Rous' work was
not fully appreciated

15
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
for some time.
But it was eventually appreciated.

16
00:01:32 --> 00:01:37
And Rous actually won the Nobel
Prize 50 years after he made this

17
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
discovery, when it was confirmed
that indeed the stuff that he was

18
00:01:41 --> 00:01:46
studying was highly relevant to the
situation in humans.

19
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
Not analogous, necessarily,
but highly relevant.  Over the years,

20
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
since that discovery and discoveries
made by others,

21
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
demonstrated that the Rous sarcoma
virus viral genome carried a set of

22
00:02:00 --> 00:02:09
genes that were familiar.

23
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
These are the same sorts of genes
carried by many viruses of this

24
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
class.  Rous sarcoma virus happens
to be a retrovirus.

25
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
I'll teach you more about those in
a future lecture.

26
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
It's the same general class that
includes HIV.  And there were some

27
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
familiar genes that were responsible
for the replication functions

28
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
of the virus.
But then there was a new gene

29
00:02:32 --> 00:02:36
present in this strain of the virus,
specific to Rous sarcoma virus,

30
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
which was named Src and was later
considered to be the relevant

31
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
oncogene, the gene that was
responsible for the tumor forming

32
00:02:45 --> 00:02:50
capabilities of this Rous sarcoma
virus.  So there was then great

33
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
interest in what was this Src gene?
What was this special gene that

34
00:02:54 --> 00:02:59
could cause normal cells
to become cancer cells?

35
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
And research then went on for,
again, a number of years studying

36
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
Src, studying its biochemical
functions, but the real question

37
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
that was of great interest over the
years was where did Src come from?

38
00:03:10 --> 00:03:20
Most viruses in this class don't

39
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
carry Src, and it wasn't at all
clear what the origins of this

40
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
cancer-causing gene were.
Was it a rare viral gene or perhaps

41
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
did it come from the host
cells themselves?

42
00:03:32 --> 00:03:37
And in experiments that were done,
actually by my PhD advisor, Harold

43
00:03:37 --> 00:03:42
Varmus and his colleague Mike Bishop,
it was shown that the Src gene

44
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
actually does indeed reside in the
cells of the host and gets picked up

45
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
by a recombination process by the
virus.  And I'll just illustrate

46
00:03:53 --> 00:03:58
that for you.  It turns out that
there's a related virus fairly

47
00:03:58 --> 00:04:04
common in chickens called
avian leukosis virus.

48
00:04:04 --> 00:04:09
And this is the predecessor of Rous
sarcoma virus.

49
00:04:09 --> 00:04:14
It's a virus that has in its genome
just the replication genes.

50
00:04:14 --> 00:04:19
And I'll just draw a viral capsid
around this virus.

51
00:04:19 --> 00:04:24
So this is the avian leukosis virus
with its genome and replication

52
00:04:24 --> 00:04:29
genes.  Now, what they showed was
that the avian leukosis virus,

53
00:04:29 --> 00:04:34
when it infects cells, here's a
normal chicken cell.

54
00:04:34 --> 00:04:42
Most of the time it just makes more

55
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
copies of itself like viruses will
do.  But occasionally,

56
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
through a recombination mechanism,
the avian leukosis virus will

57
00:04:53 --> 00:04:58
actually pick up a gene which is
present in the normal genome of the

58
00:04:58 --> 00:05:03
chicken, a gene which looks very
much like the Src gene present in

59
00:05:03 --> 00:05:08
Rous sarcoma virus.
And through this recombination

60
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
mechanism, the details of which I
won't go through,

61
00:05:14 --> 00:05:19
very rarely you'll get a recombinant
virus produced which has in its

62
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
genome the replication genes,
but now also Src gene.  And this

63
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
virus, which modifies the Src gene
slightly in the course of the

64
00:05:30 --> 00:05:36
development of the virus,
now, when introduced into birds,

65
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
will very efficiently cause tumors.
And what this showed,

66
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
what this actually Nobel Prize
winning experiment showed was that

67
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
the oncogene, powerful
cancer-causing gene resides in the

68
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
DNA of the chicken.
And actually there were similar

69
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
genes, very analogous genes residing
in the DNA of all vertebrate species,

70
00:05:57 --> 00:06:03
including humans.
You are sitting there with two

71
00:06:03 --> 00:06:09
copies of the Src gene inside of you.
So a question is,

72
00:06:09 --> 00:06:16
if that's true, if we all have these
oncogenes in our cells why don't we

73
00:06:16 --> 00:06:23
get cancer?  Why aren't we all
sitting there as one large sarcoma?

74
00:06:23 --> 00:06:30
Anybody?  Well, there are two
answers.  Yeah?  Somebody.

75
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
Claudette is pointing to somebody.
Am I blind?  Oh, hi.  Excellent.

76
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
Yes.  So what's different about the
situation in the chicken cell and

77
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
the situation in the viral genome is
how the gene is expressed.

78
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
Here it might be expressed properly
under what we would call

79
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
physiological control,
express where it's supposed to be

80
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
when it's supposed to be.
And here it's been removed from

81
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
that regulatory network and is
expressed perhaps at two high levels

82
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
at the wrong time.
And under those conditions it can

83
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
push cells to inappropriately divide.
So the virus has hijacked this gene

84
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
and changes its regulation.
That's one explanation.  There's

85
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
potentially another explanation for
why we're not all sitting around

86
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
with tumors, and I'll come to that
in a moment.  Now,

87
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
as I said, Varmus and Bishop won the
Nobel Prize for this work in 1989.

88
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
And the day that they won the Nobel
Prize Harold Varmus' sister-in-law

89
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
was standing in a cafeteria line at
Berkeley and she overheard two guys

90
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
talking behind her.
One guy said to the other,

91
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
what are you going to have for lunch?
And the other guy said,

92
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
I don't know but it ain't going to
be the chicken because two guys just

93
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
won the Nobel Prize for showing that
chicken causes cancer.

94
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
[LAUGHTER]  Which is not exactly
true.  But nevertheless.

95
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
Now we know since that work that
there are a large number of these

96
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
viruses which are called
collectively acutely transforming

97
00:07:58 --> 00:08:06
viruses.

98
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
There are a large number of acutely
transforming viruses that carry in

99
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
their genomes and oncogene which
they have cooperated from the host

100
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
cell.  These viruses are not viruses
of human beings.

101
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
They're viruses of experimental
animals and usually generated in an

102
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
experimental setting.
Mice, rats, chickens,

103
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
turkeys, other species have been
used to generate such viruses.

104
00:08:29 --> 00:08:33
And about 50 or so oncogenes have
been discovered through this context,

105
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
including one that's hopefully
familiar to you already and will

106
00:08:37 --> 00:08:42
come again, members of the Ras gene
family which I've told you about as

107
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
an important signaling molecule in
mitogenic signaling pathways,

108
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
and another important oncogene that
I'll mention briefly later called

109
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
mic, and about 50 more.
And it turns out that they were a

110
00:08:55 --> 00:09:00
very useful source to identify
cancer-associated genes in humans.

111
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
Many of the genes that we now know
are important in human cancer were

112
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
initially discovered through that
process.  Now,

113
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
as I said, most of the time human
cancer has nothing to do with

114
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
viruses so don't be confused.
There are a few human cancers that

115
00:09:16 --> 00:09:20
are virally associated.
The major one is cervical cancer.

116
00:09:20 --> 00:09:28
About 50% of cervical cancers,

117
00:09:28 --> 00:09:34
particularly in the Developing World,
are associated with the virus called

118
00:09:34 --> 00:09:40
human papillomavirus or HPV,
and specifically the high-risk types.

119
00:09:40 --> 00:09:46
Not all papillomaviruses will cause

120
00:09:46 --> 00:09:50
cancer.  Papillomavirus is the same
virus that causes warts,

121
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
for example.  And there are many
papillomaviruses that are not

122
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
associated with true malignancies,
but human papillomaviruses of the

123
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
high-risk type are.
And they can give rise to cervical

124
00:10:01 --> 00:10:05
cancer.  Fortunately,
companies are now developing

125
00:10:05 --> 00:10:09
vaccines against HPVs which are
greatly affecting the risk of

126
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
cervical cancer around the world.
So this is a major step forward in

127
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
controlling this particular cancer
type.  So because most human cancers

128
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
are not virally associated,
there was still some skepticism

129
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
about the importance of this
discovery for human cancer.

130
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
Maybe it was true of the viruses,
maybe it was true of these

131
00:10:29 --> 00:10:33
experimental animals,
but is it true of human beings?

132
00:10:33 --> 00:10:39
Do these oncogenes have anything to
do with human cancer?

133
00:10:39 --> 00:10:45
And this debate went on for a
little while longer until Bob

134
00:10:45 --> 00:10:51
Weinberg here at MIT in about 1980
did the following experiment.

135
00:10:51 --> 00:11:00
He took DNA not from a bird but from

136
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
a human being who carried a tumor in
his bladder.  So this individual had

137
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
bladder cancer.
This cancer was put into cell

138
00:11:12 --> 00:11:18
culture and turned into a cancer
cell line, and it was actually this

139
00:11:18 --> 00:11:24
material that Weinberg's lab worked
with.  And they asked the question,

140
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
are there genes in the cancer cell
line that are cancer-causing?

141
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
Are there oncogenes that I can
discover within those cancer cells?

142
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
So the experiment that they did was
to take DNA, they isolated DNA from

143
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
the cancer cells,
and they introduced it into mouse

144
00:11:45 --> 00:11:51
cells in the laboratory
that were "normal".

145
00:11:51 --> 00:11:57
And what I mean by that is they

146
00:11:57 --> 00:12:01
looked pretty normal compared to the
cancer cells which had a deranged

147
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
sort of architecture, as
I mentioned last time.

148
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
They grew flat and didn't grow on
top of each other like cancer cells

149
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
will do.  And,
importantly, if you were to inject

150
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
these cells into an
immunocompromised mouse they

151
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
wouldn't form a tumor.
They were nontumorigenic.

152
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
Whereas, these cells, if injected
into a mouse, would form tumors.

153
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
OK?  So they isolated DNA from the
cancer cells and put it

154
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
on the mouse cells.
The mouse cells will,

155
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
at some frequency, take up the DNA,
incorporate the human DNA into their

156
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
own genomes and begin to express the
genes from the human DNA.

157
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
And they found at low frequency
that within this population of

158
00:12:49 --> 00:12:55
otherwise normal-looking mouse cells
abnormal colonies of "transformed"

159
00:12:55 --> 00:13:00
cells could be found.
And these transformed cells looked a

160
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
lot like the cancer cells.
Their shape was different,

161
00:13:04 --> 00:13:09
they grew on top of one another,
and they had other properties that

162
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
also made them similar to cancer
cells in the sense that if they

163
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
injected these cells into an
immunocompromised animal,

164
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
whereas the normal cells would not
form a tumor, these transformed

165
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
cells would.  So they were able to
convert normal cells into cancer

166
00:13:26 --> 00:13:31
cells through the addition of DNA
from a cancer cell line.

167
00:13:31 --> 00:13:36
So what's going on here?
What did they do in this experiment?

168
00:13:36 --> 00:13:41
Yeah.  They eventually did.
To get to that point they were able

169
00:13:41 --> 00:13:46
to isolate from the full genome of
the cancer cell an individual gene

170
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52
that had been transferred into these
mouse cells.  They isolated that

171
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
human gene away from the mouse genes,
and then they preformed

172
00:13:57 --> 00:14:02
DNA sequencing.
And they discovered the first human

173
00:14:02 --> 00:14:06
oncogene that was isolated from a
cancer as opposed to a virus.

174
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
And, as I alluded to last time,
the gene that they isolated in this

175
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
fashion was a familiar one.
It was the Ras gene, a gene that

176
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
had been discovered in the context
of acutely transforming retroviruses.

177
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
It was already known to be
cancer-associated,

178
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
but now it's in the context of real
human cancer.  And this

179
00:14:26 --> 00:14:31
was a major advance.
Moreover, they sequenced the Ras

180
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
gene from the cancer and compared it
to the sequence of the Ras gene from

181
00:14:35 --> 00:14:40
normal cells and they found a
difference.  They found that it had

182
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
been mutated, just as the genetic
theory of cancer would predict.

183
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
Compared to the normal sequence of
the Ras gene, which is shown above,

184
00:14:48 --> 00:14:53
the sequence of the Ras gene
isolated from the human bladder

185
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
cancer sample carried a single
mutation which converted a glycine

186
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
amino acid to a valine amino acid.
And the consequence of that mutation

187
00:15:02 --> 00:15:07
changed the Ras protein from being a
signaling molecule that could be

188
00:15:07 --> 00:15:12
regulated from an on state to an off
state to a signaling molecule that

189
00:15:12 --> 00:15:17
could not be regulated.
Once it go turned on it couldn't'

190
00:15:17 --> 00:15:22
get turned off.
So it was a constitutively active

191
00:15:22 --> 00:15:27
signaling molecule,
which makes sense for a cancer cell

192
00:15:27 --> 00:15:32
that is continually proliferating.
Now, there's an issue here that I

193
00:15:32 --> 00:15:37
would like you to ponder.
And that is that this is a single

194
00:15:37 --> 00:15:42
point mutation,
a single base change.

195
00:15:42 --> 00:15:47
In all of your cells,
during cell division, there's a

196
00:15:47 --> 00:15:52
particular mutation rate.
It's not known exactly, at least

197
00:15:52 --> 00:15:57
for all cells in your body what that
rate is.  But let's estimate that

198
00:15:57 --> 00:16:03
it's about ten to the minus ninth
per base pair per cell division.

199
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
Now, if you calculate how many cell
divisions are going on in your body

200
00:16:07 --> 00:16:12
at any given time,
you can estimate that you have about

201
00:16:12 --> 00:16:17
ten to the third to ten to the fifth
Ras mutant cells inside you as you

202
00:16:17 --> 00:16:22
sit there today.
Maybe as many 100,

203
00:16:22 --> 00:16:27
00.  Maybe more than a million cells
that carry that very mutation

204
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32
in your bodies.
So I ask you again,

205
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
why is it that you don't all have
tumors?  This time it's not the

206
00:16:36 --> 00:16:40
explanation that we heard before
about regulation because this is the

207
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
native gene which is being changed.
It's being regulated the same way.

208
00:16:44 --> 00:16:48
So why is it that we don't all have
bladder cancer,

209
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
for example, or some other type of
tumor?  Well, it relates to what I

210
00:16:52 --> 00:16:56
told you last time,
that cancer is rarely a single-step

211
00:16:56 --> 00:17:01
event.
Cancers rarely are associated with a

212
00:17:01 --> 00:17:05
single mutation.
A single mutation may be involved,

213
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
may be involved in initiation, but
it's not sufficient to give you all

214
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
the steps you need for a full cancer.
As I mentioned last time,

215
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
you might need five, ten or twenty
distinct mutations to get a true

216
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
cancer.  So you might have mutant
cells in you, they might be totally

217
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
normal, but if layered on top of
those mutations are other mutations

218
00:17:26 --> 00:17:31
they could progress.  OK?
Now, that's particularly important

219
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
because the mutations that we're
talking about are,

220
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
at least by some assays,
dominant.  And the old genetics

221
00:17:39 --> 00:17:44
terminology of dominant and
recessive, these mutations are

222
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
dominant.  Note,
in this assay we're transferring a

223
00:17:48 --> 00:17:53
single gene into an otherwise normal
cell and seeing a phenotype.

224
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
That's an example of dominance.
And these genes can, in the right

225
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
context, function in a dominant
fashion on top of a normal copy or

226
00:18:01 --> 00:18:06
normal copies of the gene.
And you'll see why a distinction

227
00:18:06 --> 00:18:10
between dominant and recessive is
important in a moment.

228
00:18:10 --> 00:18:14
Now, as I hope you remember from
earlier lectures about signal

229
00:18:14 --> 00:18:19
transduction, the Ras proteins fall
within a signal transduction pathway

230
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
that's very well worked out.
They link transmembrane growth

231
00:18:23 --> 00:18:28
factor receptors through
intermediary proteins,

232
00:18:28 --> 00:18:32
adaptors and exchange factors,
to downstream components involved in,

233
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
for example, phosphorylation kinases
and transcription factors that turn

234
00:18:36 --> 00:18:41
on the expression of target genes.
This is the pathway that I've

235
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
illustrated to you before.
And we now know that many of the

236
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
components of this pathway,
this so-called mitogenic signaling

237
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
pathway that drives cells to divide
are mutated in cancers.

238
00:18:53 --> 00:18:57
Not just Ras, which is actually
mutated at pretty high frequency in

239
00:18:57 --> 00:19:02
cancers, but many of these
components are mutated as well.

240
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
And they're mutated through
different mechanisms.

241
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
Subtle mutations, like I've just
told you about for Ras,

242
00:19:10 --> 00:19:15
where single nucleotides can be
changed and a single amino acid can

243
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
be changed to convert a normally
regulated protein into an abnormally

244
00:19:19 --> 00:19:24
regulated protein like Ras.
Some of the growth factor receptors

245
00:19:24 --> 00:19:28
are likewise activated by that
mechanism.  But there are other

246
00:19:28 --> 00:19:33
mechanisms, other activation
mechanisms for cancer-associated

247
00:19:33 --> 00:19:37
genes, including gene amplification
and translocation which I'll

248
00:19:37 --> 00:19:42
illustrate on the board.
I hope you noticed on the right here,

249
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
Review Sessions for Monday night for
the exam on Wednesday,

250
00:19:46 --> 00:19:51
as well as Tutoring Sessions and
indications of where you're supposed

251
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
to go.  So gene amplification is
important in cancer.

252
00:19:55 --> 00:19:59
There are quite a few genes that
are amplified in tumors compared to

253
00:19:59 --> 00:20:04
normal cells.
And I'll give you one example which

254
00:20:04 --> 00:20:09
is relevant to breast cancer and
ovarian cancer.

255
00:20:09 --> 00:20:14
In normal cells,
in the DNA of normal cells there's a

256
00:20:14 --> 00:20:19
gene called HER2 which is one of
these growth factor receptors like

257
00:20:19 --> 00:20:24
number two up there.
And of course the normal cells are

258
00:20:24 --> 00:20:30
diploid so they have two copies
of the HER2 gene.

259
00:20:30 --> 00:20:35
And through normal transcription and
translation that's going to give

260
00:20:35 --> 00:20:41
rise to a particular concentration
of the growth factor receptor on the

261
00:20:41 --> 00:20:47
surface of the cells.
And that's going to give rise to a

262
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
certain signal emanating from that
growth factor receptor which will

263
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
cause the cells to divide at the
appropriate time and place.

264
00:20:59 --> 00:21:05
In about 30% of breast cancers and a
similar percentage of ovarian

265
00:21:05 --> 00:21:11
cancers, the number of copies of the
HER2 gene has been increased

266
00:21:11 --> 00:21:17
dramatically, sometimes as much as a
hundred fold.  And these are due to

267
00:21:17 --> 00:21:23
errors in DNA replication.
Instead of having DNA copied once

268
00:21:23 --> 00:21:29
in this region,
it gets copied again and again and

269
00:21:29 --> 00:21:34
again and again.
And now, in these cancer cells,

270
00:21:34 --> 00:21:38
you don't have that same
concentration of the growth factor

271
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
receptor.  You have a much higher
concentration of the receptor.

272
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
And because there's a much higher
concentration of the receptor,

273
00:21:46 --> 00:21:51
you might get as much as ten or a
hundred times the level of signaling.

274
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
And the consequences of this are
that a cell that shouldn't divide

275
00:21:55 --> 00:21:59
doesn't have actually enough
concentration of growth factors

276
00:21:59 --> 00:22:04
where it should normally divide will
now divide anyway.

277
00:22:04 --> 00:22:07
Inappropriate proliferation,
the hallmark of cancer.  Now,

278
00:22:07 --> 00:22:11
the good news here is that there are
antibodies against this HER2 protein.

279
00:22:11 --> 00:22:14
And they are actually effective in
the treatment of breast cancer.

280
00:22:14 --> 00:22:18
They can prolong the life of women
with breast cancer,

281
00:22:18 --> 00:22:21
specifically those who have
amplifications of this gene.

282
00:22:21 --> 00:22:25
This drug actually does nothing for
women who don't have amplifications,

283
00:22:25 --> 00:22:29
but it prolongs the life of women
who do.

284
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
So that's an important link between
basic biology and treatment.

285
00:22:33 --> 00:22:38
We'll talk more about those next
time.  Another mechanism of

286
00:22:38 --> 00:22:43
activation of oncogenes
is translocation.

287
00:22:43 --> 00:22:51
I showed you last time karyotypes of

288
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
cancer cells in which one piece of
one chromosome gets linked to a

289
00:22:55 --> 00:22:59
piece of a different chromosome.
The reason that happens and is

290
00:22:59 --> 00:23:03
selected for is that new regulatory
networks or new genes can be

291
00:23:03 --> 00:23:08
produced by those kinds of break and
joining reactions.

292
00:23:08 --> 00:23:11
And one famous one involves this
gene called myc which is a

293
00:23:11 --> 00:23:15
transcription factor like the bottom
of this pathway,

294
00:23:15 --> 00:23:19
like number eight there,
transcription factor which is

295
00:23:19 --> 00:23:23
important in driving cells into the
cell cycle.  myc is normally

296
00:23:23 --> 00:23:30
expressed from a "weak promoter".

297
00:23:30 --> 00:23:33
Which means that not a whole lot of
myc mRNA is produced,

298
00:23:33 --> 00:23:37
which means that not that much myc
protein is produced at any given

299
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
time in a cell.
And this gives rise to regulated

300
00:23:41 --> 00:23:51
cell division.

301
00:23:51 --> 00:23:56
However, occasionally in cancers,
particularly in certain types of

302
00:23:56 --> 00:24:01
leukemia and lymphoma,
translocation events take place

303
00:24:01 --> 00:24:07
where a new segment of DNA is
produced which joins the normal myc

304
00:24:07 --> 00:24:16
gene to a very strong promoter.

305
00:24:16 --> 00:24:20
And now, just like this gentlemen
mentioned before about the RSV,

306
00:24:20 --> 00:24:25
now a gene is not regulated properly.
It's now regulated,

307
00:24:25 --> 00:24:30
in this case, too strongly.
So a lot of myc mRNA is produced

308
00:24:30 --> 00:24:35
which gives rise to a lot of myc
protein which gives rise to

309
00:24:35 --> 00:24:44
unregulated cell growth.

310
00:24:44 --> 00:24:48
Again, the hallmark of cancer.
So the DNA of tumor cells changes

311
00:24:48 --> 00:24:52
by point mutations,
by gene amplifications,

312
00:24:52 --> 00:24:56
by translocations, as well as by
gene deletions,

313
00:24:56 --> 00:25:00
which I haven't shown you but also
occur.

314
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
And together these mutations are
found in virtually all human cancers.

315
00:25:04 --> 00:25:09
Sometimes RAS,
sometimes in growth factor receptor,

316
00:25:09 --> 00:25:13
sometimes in transcription factor,
but one place or another you would

317
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
typically find a mutation in this
pathway.  So signaling proliferation

318
00:25:18 --> 00:25:22
is key to tumor development.
And that's not too surprising given

319
00:25:22 --> 00:25:27
how we think about how cancers arise.
But these oncogenes,

320
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
these positive regulators of
tumorogenesis are not the only genes

321
00:25:31 --> 00:25:36
that are important.
Normal cells do,

322
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
in fact, use these signals.
And I've equated them with like the

323
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
gas peddle on your car,
go signals, which cause normal cells

324
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
to divide when it's appropriate to
divide during development or injury

325
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
repair or cell replenishment.
But there's another class of genes

326
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
that turns on when it's appropriate
for cells to stop dividing.

327
00:25:56 --> 00:26:00
So these genes are the equivalent
of the stop signals which would

328
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
impose themselves when cell division
should cease.

329
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
Now, oncogenes promote cell division.
Too much oncogene product,

330
00:26:08 --> 00:26:12
a mutant oncogene product will cause
normal cells to divide too often.

331
00:26:12 --> 00:26:16
But in addition to those we find
mutations in the stop signals,

332
00:26:16 --> 00:26:20
the signals that would normally halt
proliferation.

333
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
And this allows an even greater
accumulation of cells.

334
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
The go signals are the equivalent
of oncogene mutations and the stop

335
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
mutations are the equivalent of
another class of genes known as

336
00:26:32 --> 00:27:12
tumor suppressor genes.

337
00:27:12 --> 00:27:17
Tumor suppressor genes have been
known for about 20 years now.

338
00:27:17 --> 00:27:22
And the first one comes from this
tumor here.  This is a child with a

339
00:27:22 --> 00:27:27
tumor called retinoblastoma.
It's a tumor of the retina.  It's

340
00:27:27 --> 00:27:37
actually really rare.

341
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
It occurs in about one in 40,
00 births in the general population,

342
00:27:41 --> 00:27:46
but there are individuals who are
familialy predisposed to

343
00:27:46 --> 00:27:50
retinoblastoma.
And in these kids 90% of the time

344
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
they will develop retinoblastoma
actually affecting both eyes.

345
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
So can be actually a fairly common
and severe disease in that sense.

346
00:28:00 --> 00:28:05
This gene, the gene responsible for
retinoblastoma was cloned,

347
00:28:05 --> 00:28:10
again in Bob Weinberg's lab several
years ago.  And we now know that

348
00:28:10 --> 00:28:16
it's an important cell cycle
regulator, as is indicated here.

349
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
So the retinoblastoma gene encodes
a retinoblastoma protein.

350
00:28:21 --> 00:28:26
The retinoblastoma protein is
called pRB.  And,

351
00:28:26 --> 00:28:32
as is illustrated on this slide,
the RB protein is a negative

352
00:28:32 --> 00:28:36
regulator of the cell cycle.
As you recall,

353
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40
cells normally cycle from M phase to
G1/S phase through again.

354
00:28:40 --> 00:28:44
And the RB protein acts normally to
restrain cell division.

355
00:28:44 --> 00:28:48
It blocks cells in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle when it's active.

356
00:28:48 --> 00:28:52
When cells receive signals from
growth factor pathways they

357
00:28:52 --> 00:28:56
inactivate the RB gene through
phosphorylation,

358
00:28:56 --> 00:29:00
the RB protein through
phosphorylation.

359
00:29:00 --> 00:29:04
And this occurs by cyclin-CDK
complexes, which I told you about in

360
00:29:04 --> 00:29:09
the cell cycle lectures.
There are actually two different

361
00:29:09 --> 00:29:13
cyclin-CDK proteins which
phosphorylate RB and inactivate it.

362
00:29:13 --> 00:29:18
So when you need to divide you
inactive this brake on the cell

363
00:29:18 --> 00:29:22
cycle and the cells can divide.
When you need to stop dividing you

364
00:29:22 --> 00:29:27
activate certain growth inhibitory
pathways that inhibit the kinases

365
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32
that block the phosphorylation of RB
so RB stays in its active state.

366
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36
And now the cells cannot divide
anymore.  So RB is a molecular brake

367
00:29:36 --> 00:29:41
on the cell cycle.
RB mutations, and mutations in

368
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
other components of this pathway
occur in about 90% of human tumors.

369
00:29:46 --> 00:29:51
It's a very, very commonly affected
pathway in tumor development.

370
00:29:51 --> 00:29:56
What kind of mutations would you
expect to see in the RB gene in

371
00:29:56 --> 00:30:01
human cancer?  Would you expect to
see gene amplifications,

372
00:30:01 --> 00:30:06
translocations that cause too much
of the RB protein to be produced?

373
00:30:06 --> 00:30:09
Does that sound right?
Remember, it's a brake.

374
00:30:09 --> 00:30:12
So what kinds of mutations do you
expect to find?

375
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
Nonsense mutations.
Or more generally inactivating

376
00:30:16 --> 00:30:27
mutations.

377
00:30:27 --> 00:30:34
Nonsense mutations.
Maybe deletions which would remove

378
00:30:34 --> 00:30:41
the gene all together.
Now, are these mutations dominant

379
00:30:41 --> 00:30:48
or recessive?  Inactivating
mutations are recessive.

380
00:30:48 --> 00:30:55
So what's going on here?

381
00:30:55 --> 00:30:59
We all have two copies of the RB
gene, and yet we're saying that the

382
00:30:59 --> 00:31:03
mutations that take place in this
gene are loss of function mutations,

383
00:31:03 --> 00:31:06
inactivating mutations.
So how is it that you ever find RB

384
00:31:06 --> 00:31:15
mutations in cancer?

385
00:31:15 --> 00:31:20
Well, the answer is that one
mutation is not enough.

386
00:31:20 --> 00:31:25
One mutation of one copy of the RB
gene is not enough.

387
00:31:25 --> 00:31:31
For tumor suppressor genes were the
mutations are recessive,

388
00:31:31 --> 00:31:37
you need two hits.
Two mutational events are required

389
00:31:37 --> 00:31:43
to now fully deprive the cell of the
brake.  One mutation is not enough.

390
00:31:43 --> 00:31:50
And this is now known in the field
as the two-hit model of tumor

391
00:31:50 --> 00:31:56
development, at least for tumor
suppressor genes.  And it's

392
00:31:56 --> 00:32:02
illustrated here.
Because we carry two copies of all

393
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
of our genes, two mutational events
are required to eliminate the

394
00:32:06 --> 00:32:10
function of a tumor suppressor gene.
And this is what it looks like.  If

395
00:32:10 --> 00:32:14
this is a normal cell which has two
normal copies of the RB gene,

396
00:32:14 --> 00:32:18
the first thing to happen is that
one copy of the RB gene incurs a

397
00:32:18 --> 00:32:22
mutation.  It might be a nonsense
mutation or a deletion,

398
00:32:22 --> 00:32:26
but whatever it is it eliminates the
function of the RB gene.

399
00:32:26 --> 00:32:30
But this cell itself is normal
because it still has one normal copy

400
00:32:30 --> 00:32:34
of the RB gene and this is
a recessive mutation.

401
00:32:34 --> 00:32:38
So this cell here is actually normal,
but it's one step away from lacking

402
00:32:38 --> 00:32:43
the RB gene all together.
And there are a number of ways that

403
00:32:43 --> 00:32:47
that second copy of the gene can be
lost.  And they're illustrated by

404
00:32:47 --> 00:32:52
these different arrows.
The simplest thing to think about

405
00:32:52 --> 00:32:56
is that that second copy of the RB
gene picks up its own mutation.

406
00:32:56 --> 00:33:00
We call that a de novo mutation.
And now you have a cell which has

407
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
two independently mutated copies of
RB, and that's a cell that now has

408
00:33:04 --> 00:33:08
lost control of proliferation.
But there are other mechanisms,

409
00:33:08 --> 00:33:12
which are illustrated here, where
the second copy of the RB gene is

410
00:33:12 --> 00:33:16
actually lost all together because
the chromosome that carries that

411
00:33:16 --> 00:33:20
gene is itself lost giving rise to a
cell that only has one copy of the

412
00:33:20 --> 00:33:24
chromosome.  And it's the one that
has the mutant RB gene.

413
00:33:24 --> 00:33:28
Or there's a recombination event
which replaces the good copy of the

414
00:33:28 --> 00:33:33
RB gene with the bad copy of the RB
gene giving rise to a cell that is

415
00:33:33 --> 00:33:38
lacking functional RB once again.
And this term here is called loss

416
00:33:38 --> 00:33:54
of heterozygosity or LOH.

417
00:33:54 --> 00:33:57
And it's a hallmark of tumor
suppressor gene mutations.

418
00:33:57 --> 00:34:00
It's an indication that there's a
tumor suppressor gene mutation

419
00:34:00 --> 00:34:05
in the region.
It's usually detected not by a

420
00:34:05 --> 00:34:11
change in the tumor suppressor gene
itself but rather by some linked

421
00:34:11 --> 00:34:17
polymorphic marker like a SNP which
is close by to the RB gene or

422
00:34:17 --> 00:34:23
whatever tumor suppressor gene it is.
This individual has a big A,

423
00:34:23 --> 00:34:30
little A, and therefore is
heterozygous.

424
00:34:30 --> 00:34:34
He or she is heterozygous,
big A, little A.  But if you notice

425
00:34:34 --> 00:34:38
in the tumors,
if the tumors arise by chromosome

426
00:34:38 --> 00:34:42
loss or by mitotic recombination,
the individual has lost the little A

427
00:34:42 --> 00:34:47
allele.  Either there's only big A
or there are two copies of big A,

428
00:34:47 --> 00:34:51
in which case we've seen loss of
heterozygosity,

429
00:34:51 --> 00:34:55
LOH.  And that's a common feature of
tumor suppressor gene mutations.

430
00:34:55 --> 00:35:00
And I suspect you'll hear about it
in problem sets and beyond.

431
00:35:00 --> 00:35:04
So LOH is an important mechanism
which allows us to go from one hit

432
00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
to two hits.  OK.
Now, RB is not the only tumor

433
00:35:08 --> 00:35:13
suppressor gene that's mutated in
cancer.  And proliferation is not

434
00:35:13 --> 00:35:17
the only process that affected in
tumorigenesis.

435
00:35:17 --> 00:35:22
As I told you,
at the end of the day in cancer we

436
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
care about how many cells we have.
And you can have too many cells by

437
00:35:26 --> 00:35:31
increasing proliferation.
And the RAS mutations and RB loss

438
00:35:31 --> 00:35:35
are examples of how you can have too
much proliferation.

439
00:35:35 --> 00:35:39
But you can also have too little
cell death.  And we actually have

440
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
examples of both oncogenes,
which are activated to prevent cell

441
00:35:43 --> 00:35:47
death, and tumor suppressor genes
that are lost to prevent cell death.

442
00:35:47 --> 00:35:52
So let me tell you a little bit
about those.

443
00:35:52 --> 00:36:02
The first gene that was associated

444
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
with apoptosis and cancer was this
gene called Bcl2.

445
00:36:06 --> 00:36:11
It's related to one of the first
apoptosis genes discovered in the

446
00:36:11 --> 00:36:16
Horvitz lab here at MIT,
and it's involved in regulating

447
00:36:16 --> 00:36:20
caspases.  You've probably forgotten
by now but caspases are proteases

448
00:36:20 --> 00:36:25
that are kept normally inside your
cells in an inactive state.

449
00:36:25 --> 00:36:30
And they get activated by cell
death signals.

450
00:36:30 --> 00:36:36
Signals that would trigger the cells
to commit apoptosis which causes the

451
00:36:36 --> 00:36:44
caspases to become active.

452
00:36:44 --> 00:36:50
And this then leads to the program
of cell death.

453
00:36:50 --> 00:36:56
The Bcl2 gene functions to block,
downstream of the death signals, the

454
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
activation of caspases.
Is Bcl2 an oncogene or a tumor

455
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
suppressor gene?
Does it get activated during cancer

456
00:37:07 --> 00:37:13
or inactivated during cancer?
Activated.  You want to suppress

457
00:37:13 --> 00:37:19
cell death in tumorigenesis.
And Bcl2 does that, so Bcl2 gets

458
00:37:19 --> 00:37:25
activated.  It's an oncogene.
And it's typically activated by

459
00:37:25 --> 00:37:31
translocation, in the cases
where it is involved.

460
00:37:31 --> 00:37:36
Translocation,
like with myc, too much Bcl2,

461
00:37:36 --> 00:37:41
inappropriate cell survival.
Another very important gene in

462
00:37:41 --> 00:37:47
tumorigenesis that regulates
apoptosis is p53.

463
00:37:47 --> 00:38:01
p53 is actually the most commonly

464
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
affected gene in all human cancer.
50% of all tumors --

465
00:38:07 --> 00:38:17
-- carry p53 mutations.

466
00:38:17 --> 00:38:22
That's a remarkable number.
And p53, we now know, is an

467
00:38:22 --> 00:38:27
important regulator of apoptosis.
It doesn't *only* regulate

468
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
apoptosis but it is an important
regulator of apoptosis.

469
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
p53 is like a molecular policeman
inside your cells.

470
00:38:37 --> 00:38:41
It's present at very low levels
normally, and it's responsive to

471
00:38:41 --> 00:38:46
various stress signals.
When cells get stressed,

472
00:38:46 --> 00:38:50
for example when their DNA gets
damaged or they recognize that

473
00:38:50 --> 00:38:55
they're proliferating abnormally or
they're starved of oxygen,

474
00:38:55 --> 00:38:59
the levels of p53 protein go way up.
And when that happens the cells

475
00:38:59 --> 00:39:04
either arrest to try to repair the
damage or they will commit suicide

476
00:39:04 --> 00:39:08
killing themselves so they cannot go
on to become life-threatening

477
00:39:08 --> 00:39:13
tumors.
So is p53 an oncogene or a tumor

478
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
suppressor gene?
Is it activated in cancer or

479
00:39:17 --> 00:39:21
inactivated in cancer?
Inactivated.  It's a tumor

480
00:39:21 --> 00:39:25
suppressor gene.
Cancer cells don't want to die so

481
00:39:25 --> 00:39:30
they get rid of p53 to
prevent the death.

482
00:39:30 --> 00:39:34
So p53 is a tumor suppressor gene
and a very frequently mutated one in

483
00:39:34 --> 00:39:39
human cancers.
You can study p53 in a variety of

484
00:39:39 --> 00:39:44
ways.  My lab has been studying it
for a dozen years using mice that

485
00:39:44 --> 00:39:48
carry mutations in p53 that were
generated by gene targeting

486
00:39:48 --> 00:39:53
technology.  You don't need to know
the details of this,

487
00:39:53 --> 00:39:58
but suffice to say it's possible to
create mice which are either

488
00:39:58 --> 00:40:03
heterozygous for a p53 mutation or
homozygous for a p53 mutation.

489
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
And the question we asked in those
experiments is would these

490
00:40:07 --> 00:40:12
heterozygous mutant mice or
homozygous mutant mice be cancer

491
00:40:12 --> 00:40:17
prone?  Should they be?
Would you expect an animal that's

492
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
lacking p53, one copy or both,
to be cancer prone?  It's a tumor

493
00:40:21 --> 00:40:26
suppressor gene so,
yeah, absolutely.  And sure enough

494
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
it is.
If you look at a population of mice

495
00:40:32 --> 00:40:39
and plot their percent survival as a
function of time,

496
00:40:39 --> 00:40:45
one year, two years,
three years, mice live about three

497
00:40:45 --> 00:40:52
years, normal mice with two copies
of p53 will live a normal lifespan.

498
00:40:52 --> 00:40:59
Mice that have one functional copy
of p53 die sooner.

499
00:40:59 --> 00:41:05
They live about a year and a half.
And if you look in the tumors of

500
00:41:05 --> 00:41:10
these mice, the normal copy of p53
is missing, which is the prediction

501
00:41:10 --> 00:41:15
of the two-hit model of
tumorigenesis.

502
00:41:15 --> 00:41:20
You need to get rid of both copies.
And p53 minus-minus mice only make

503
00:41:20 --> 00:41:25
it about four to six months and die
from cancer.  So p53 is an

504
00:41:25 --> 00:41:30
incredibly important tumor
suppressor gene.

505
00:41:30 --> 00:41:34
If you're mutated in it,
your risk of getting cancer goes way,

506
00:41:34 --> 00:41:39
way up.  OK.  Now,
in the last five minutes I just want

507
00:41:39 --> 00:41:44
to mention the fact that cancer,
while typically a sporadic disease --

508
00:41:44 --> 00:42:17
-- by which I mean there's

509
00:42:17 --> 00:42:27
no family history --

510
00:42:27 --> 00:42:34
-- about 5% of the time there's
familial predisposition.

511
00:42:34 --> 00:42:42
Cancer gets passed through the

512
00:42:42 --> 00:42:46
family, through the generations.
And you can see that in this

513
00:42:46 --> 00:42:49
pedigree here.
This is actually a pedigree of

514
00:42:49 --> 00:42:53
familial retinoblastoma.
The individuals who inherit the

515
00:42:53 --> 00:42:56
mutant copy of the gene most of the
time will develop the tumor,

516
00:42:56 --> 00:43:00
and they'll pass along that
predisposition to their children.

517
00:43:00 --> 00:43:05
If you were to look at this pedigree
for a while, you would see that it

518
00:43:05 --> 00:43:10
looks like an autosomal dominant
pedigree, if you remember back to

519
00:43:10 --> 00:43:15
that portion of the course.
If you inherit the mutation,

520
00:43:15 --> 00:43:20
you have a high likelihood of
developing the tumor.

521
00:43:20 --> 00:43:25
And it doesn't matter whether the
mutation is coming from your mother

522
00:43:25 --> 00:43:30
or father or whether you're a boy or
a girl.  What's surprising,

523
00:43:30 --> 00:43:35
despite that fact, is that most
familial cancer syndromes like that

524
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
one are caused by tumor suppressor
gene mutations.

525
00:43:40 --> 00:43:51
So what's being passed through the

526
00:43:51 --> 00:43:55
generations here is a mutant copy of
a tumor suppressor gene,

527
00:43:55 --> 00:43:59
the RB gene, or the breast cancer
susceptibility gene,

528
00:43:59 --> 00:44:03
or colon cancer susceptibility gene.
A loss of function copy of that gene

529
00:44:03 --> 00:44:08
such that these individuals who are
developing cancer and passing the

530
00:44:08 --> 00:44:13
mutation onto their kids are
heterozygotes.

531
00:44:13 --> 00:44:18
And, as you think about it,
you have to wonder why are they

532
00:44:18 --> 00:44:23
cancer prone?  Most of their cells
should be normal because most of

533
00:44:23 --> 00:44:28
their cells are heterozygous
for the mutation.

534
00:44:28 --> 00:44:32
But, importantly,
those cells are one step away from

535
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
mutating the other copy of the gene.
In contrast to the general

536
00:44:36 --> 00:44:40
population, it carries two normal
copies of the tumor suppressor gene.

537
00:44:40 --> 00:44:45
And in whose cells two mutational
events have to happen in succession

538
00:44:45 --> 00:44:49
to mutate the first copy and then
the second copy.

539
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
In these people all of their cells
carry the first mutation.

540
00:44:53 --> 00:44:58
They're only one mutational event
away.

541
00:44:58 --> 00:45:03
And the likelihood that that will
happen in the retinas of their eyes

542
00:45:03 --> 00:45:08
or in the developing breast or colon
is sufficiently high that there is a

543
00:45:08 --> 00:45:13
near certainty that they will
develop cancer.

544
00:45:13 --> 00:45:18
OK?  So what event must happen
during tumor development?

545
00:45:18 --> 00:45:23
A mutation in the second copy of
the gene, one of these LOH events or

546
00:45:23 --> 00:45:28
a second de novo mutation.
I also wonder what might explain

547
00:45:28 --> 00:45:33
the fact that this gentleman here,
who must have the mutation because

548
00:45:33 --> 00:45:38
he passed it onto his sons,
did not himself develop the tumor.

549
00:45:38 --> 00:45:42
Why is that?  What's going on in
that guy?  Excellent.

550
00:45:42 --> 00:45:47
That's exactly the way I phrase it,
he was lucky.  In his developing

551
00:45:47 --> 00:45:51
retina by chance no cell underwent
the second hit,

552
00:45:51 --> 00:45:56
and so his cells were just like
normal and he developed normally,

553
00:45:56 --> 00:46:00
but he still passed the mutation
onto his children and they

554
00:46:00 --> 00:46:05
weren't so lucky.
And, finally, what would happen if

555
00:46:05 --> 00:46:09
two individuals who were
heterozygous produced a homozygous

556
00:46:09 --> 00:46:13
mutant offspring?
What do you think would happen in

557
00:46:13 --> 00:46:18
those individuals?
Well, if they survive they should

558
00:46:18 --> 00:46:22
be mighty cancer prone because no
mutational event is required to

559
00:46:22 --> 00:46:26
eliminate the function in them.
They might look like these p53

560
00:46:26 --> 00:46:31
minus-minus mice.
In fact, most tumor suppressor genes

561
00:46:31 --> 00:46:35
are required for normal development.
So you cannot do that experiment.

562
00:46:35 --> 00:46:40
The embryo would never survive
because the gene is important for

563
00:46:40 --> 00:46:44
proliferation control all over the
place.  So the embryo doesn't make

564
00:46:44 --> 00:46:49
it.  So most of the time you cannot
do that experiment.

565
00:46:49 --> 00:46:53
And, finally, I'd mentioned last
time and I just want to emphasize

566
00:46:53 --> 00:46:58
that the genes that we've focused on
for you in this class are genes that

567
00:46:58 --> 00:47:03
involve proliferation control
and cell death.

568
00:47:03 --> 00:47:07
And we'd mentioned briefly DNA
damage control.

569
00:47:07 --> 00:47:12
But there are many other processes
that are important in tumorigenesis

570
00:47:12 --> 00:47:16
that are responsive to mutations in
other kinds of genes like the

571
00:47:16 --> 00:47:21
process of invasion and angiogenesis
and the all important process of

572
00:47:21 --> 00:47:24
metastasis.  So I'll stop there.
