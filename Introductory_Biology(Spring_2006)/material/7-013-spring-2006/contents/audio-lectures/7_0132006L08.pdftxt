Transcript – Lecture 8 

So we’re going to continue our discussion about genetics and patterns 
of inheritance.  We’re going go relatively quickly compared to last 
time.  We’ve got a lot to get through today so I’m going to go 
relatively quickly. 

And I printed a handout for you because I’m going to rely on the 
PowerPoint to a greater degree than I have before.  So I want you to 
have them in case you want to take notes on them.  OK?  And we will 
do that occasionally for particular lectures.  Now, importantly, we 
teach you about inheritance, not so much because we think you need 
to know about peas but rather the rules of inheritance which were 
derived from such studies but applied to many other studies. 

Including in agricultural settings, in research settings in the laboratory 
involving fruit flies and mice, but more relevant to you to humans. 
The rules that Mendel laid down apply to you and allow us to predict 
inheritance patterns based on visible traits but also disease traits.  And 
you’ll see in next lecture that the information that we’ve given you 
helps us understand inheritance of various forms of genetic disease 
and predict, for example, frequencies within such pedigrees. 

OK.  So, firstly, I wanted to review some terms which you need to 
know.  And I’ll use a lot today.  The genotype which is the alleles 
present for a given gene in an individual.  OK?  The genes.  The 
alleles.  The term homozygous which means having two of the same 
alleles. 

Heterozygous, having two different alleles for a given gene.  The 
phenotype which refers to the trait.  That’s what the researcher or the 
individual observes.  The manifestation of the activity of those genes, 
of those alleles, the observed trait.  The first filial, or F1, generation 
which is the product of a cross of individuals who are homozygous for 
different alleles of a given trait. 

I think this should say gene, not given, given.  Such that the F1 
individual is heterozygous for that gene.  That is, has two different 
alleles.  If you cross two F1s together you generate the F2 generation. 

The products of an F1 intercross.  And based on Mendel’s First Laws, 
which I told you about last time and I’ll reiterate in a second, the ratio 
of the genotypes that you see in the F2 generation is 1:2:1. 

Homozygous for one allele, heterozygous and homozygous for the 
other allele; 1:2:1.  And the ratio of phenotypes is 3:1.  That assumes 
that there is a simple dominant recessive relationship between the two 
alleles.  We closed with that last time.  The dominant is the allele that 
determines the phenotype in a heterozygous individual.  Big S, little S 
you’re smooth.  Big S is dominant over little S. 

Recessive allele is the opposite.  In a heterozygote it’s not seen.  And, 
in fact, the only time you see the phenotype associated with the 
recessive allele is when the organism is homozygous for that recessive 
allele.  And finally there’s a term codominance, which I’m going to 
mention now.  They don’t really need to know, Claudette?  We bring it 
up in Section, so I’m going to mention it here.  And I refer you to the 
relevant parts of the book, but I’m not going to cover it in lecture but 
I’ll show you where to go in the book to review that. 

And that’s relevant because Mendel’s Rules apply as simple dominant 
recessive relationships, but they actually don’t apply in terms of 
scoring them when you have a codominant situation.  So this is 
Mendel’s First Law laid out for you.  When any individual produces 
gametes, germ cells, sperm, egg, the alleles, for a particular gene 
which control particular traits separates, so that each gamete receives 
only one of a pair of alleles present in the original individual. 

And, as I said just a second ago, these experimental tests work well 
when there’s a simple dominant recessive relationship between those 
two alleles.  There are exceptions to this in terms of codominance and 
incomplete dominance.  And I refer you to Figures 10.13 and 10.14 in 
your book which show you examples from fruit flies as well as, sorry, 
from humans as well as from pea plants that illustrate both 
codominance and incomplete dominance. 

Now, to emphasize the simplicity, really, of Mendel’s First Law, I want 
to show you an example which also derives from your book using 
coins.  OK?  And it’s just to emphasize the point about probability.  So 
what this says is that you have two, if you have two alleles of a given 
gene, big A, little A, big S, little S, you’re going to hand off to your 
germ cells one or the other with equal probability. 

And your mate will do the same such that the genotype of the 
offspring is the product of the probabilities of the genotype of the 
germ cells.  OK?  So I have two coins here, two pennies which have a 
head and a tail.  All right?  Head.  Tail.  So if I flipped this coin, what’s 
the likelihood that this is a head?  1:2.  If I flip this coin, what’s the 
likelihood that it’s a head? 

1:2.  If I put these together, like in fertilization, what’s the likelihood 
that it’s both heads?  1:4.  Very good.  One in two times one in two is 
one in four.  That’s really the essence of Mendel’s First Law that the 
alleles segregate randomly into the germ cells, and you can then 
figure out Punnett Squares and the phenotype based on the 
probabilities of the different genotypes that derive from that simple 
calculation. 

OK.  We’ll come back to a slightly more complicated version 
momentarily.  OK. Now, last time we talked about smooth and 
wrinkled peas.  I don’t like this yellow chalk.  Is there white chalk 
here? 

We talked about smooth and yellow peas, smooth and wrinkled peas. 
We talked about genotypes, big S, big S, big S, little S, little S, little S. 
Remember that?  We talked about phenotypes.  What’s the phenotype 
of this pea?  Smooth. 

What’s the phenotype of this pea?  Smooth, because you know that 
big S is dominant over little S.  And what’s the phenotype of this pea? 
Wrinkled.  Good.  What if I gave you, I handed to you on your dinner 
plate a smooth pea? 

What’s its genotype?  What’s its genotype?  Who wants to venture out 
into the unknown here?  What’s its genotype?  Come on.  Yes?  Thank 
you.  You don’t know what its genotype is because it could either be 
big S, big S or big S, little S. 

It could either be big S, big S or big S, little S.  How are you going to 
tell?  How can you tell?  You can test it.  You could do what we call a 
Test Cross with a tester strain.  And a tester strain is homozygous for 
the recessive allele. 

OK?  And based on this test we can figure out whether we’re dealing 
with a big S, big S or big S, little S pea.  So we’re going to do this 
using Punnett Squares to emphasize the use of Punnett Squares.  We 
have two possibilities. 

Either our pea is big S, big S or our pea is big S, little S.  Either way 
we’re going to cross it to a pea, really a pea plant, but a pea that’s 
little S, little S.  OK?  Now, when I generate a Punnett Square what 
gametes do I put over here?  What alleles do I put over here? 

Little S, little S.  This plant only gives the little S allele to its gametes 
because that’s all it has.  What alleles do I put over here?  Big S on 
both because this plant only gives big S to its gametes.  And so 
therefore all of the offspring will be heterozygous, big S, little S, big S, 
little S.  And what will the phenotype be of all of the offspring? 

Smooth.  100% smooth.  OK.  And how about over here?  Well, this 
side of the Punnett Square is the same.  This individual only gives little 
S to its gametes.  And how about over here?  Flip a coin, half of the 
time it’s big S, half of the time it’s little S. 

If this gamete meets up with this one then that individual is going to 
be big S, little S.  The same thing over here.  With this gives little S, 
little S, this is the same thing.  What are the phenotypes here?  Half 
and half.  50% smooth, 50% wrinkled. 

OK.  That’s great.  Now --

What I want to now consider is a second trait.  And after we do this 
we’re going to consider the inheritance of the two traits together, but 
let’s just introduce the second trait now. 

The gene is the Y gene.  There are, again, two alleles, big Y and little 
Y.  And the phenotypes associated with these genotypes are yellow 
and green.  OK? 

Mendel does a lot of crossing, etc., creates pure breading strains, the 
parental strains.  And I’m going to tell you that their genotypes are 
homozygous big Y, and these produce yellow peas.  He also produces 
pure breeding strains that only ever produced green peas, and their 
genotype is little Y, little Y. 

You cross these together to generate the F1.  What’s the genotype 
with respect to Y in the F1?  Big Y, little Y.  They’re all big Y, little Y. 
And what’s the phenotype of the F1?  You don’t know.  That’s very 
good, because I haven’t told you which is dominant over which.  By 
convention, you might have guessed that big Y was dominant over 

little Y.  And if that were true, and it is, then what would be the 
phenotype? 

Yellow.  And from that you can conclude that Y is dominant over little 
Y.  OK?  I always run out of space.  Do these boards get smaller every 
year?  I mean it’s unbelievable to me. 

Now, if we take these F1s and do an intercross to generate F2s, we’re 
just reinforcing things we just learned here, in the F2 generation we’re 
going to generate individuals who are Y, Y, big Y, big Y, big Y, little Y 
and little Y, little Y.  What will be the frequency of generating such 
individuals in this cross? 

One quarter will be like this, a half will be like this, a quarter will be 
like this, and that would give a ration of 1:2:1.  The phenotypes 
associated with that will be yellow, yellow and green. 

So the ratio of the phenotypes will be 3:1.  OK?  We just redid 
Mendel’s First Law for you.  Now, what happens when we consider the 
two of these traits together, smoothness and color in the same cross? 
Well, this led Mendel to propose his Second Law which is illustrated 
here, which is that alleles of different genes, the S gene and the Y 
gene, assort independently of one another in producing gametes. 

What happens for one does not effect what happens to the other.  And 
this is true for genes that lie on separate chromosomes.  Although it’s 
not necessarily true for genes that lie on the same chromosome.  I 
make that point here, and I’ll make it again later because I don’t want 
you to come to the conclusion that two genes always assort from one 
another independently.  They do, and Mendel’s Second Law is based 
on that, in some instances, but they don’t always. 

So to illustrate that point we turn to the coins again.  I always also 
lose the coins.  OK.  So now we have our pennies once again, heads 
and tails.  And dimes, heads and tails, yeah?  OK.  So I’m going to put 
a penny and a dime in each pocket.  What’s the frequency of 
generating a penny in the head configuration and a dime in the head 
configuration together? 

Well, let’s do it differently.  What’s the frequency of generating a head, 
a penny in the head configuration here?  1:2.  What’s the frequency of 
getting a penny in the head and dime in the head?  One over four.  It’s 
one in two times one in two.  And what’s the frequency of getting 
penny head, dime head in this hand?  One over four. 

So what’s the frequency of getting penny head, penny head, dime 
head, dime head in the zygote?  1:16.  Again, simple probabilities. 
OK?  And for Mendel’s Second Law in its simplest form, it determines 
what you would expect to see in such crosses.  And, again, we’ll come 
back to a twist on that in a moment.  Now, in biological terms it looks 
like this.  And this derives from your book, so you can go and look at 
it. 

It’s adapted from Purves 10.8.  And there’s a nice little animation that 
goes along with that.  But we’re going to go through this because 
there’s some subtly here that I want you to understand.  So here is 
the parent.  It’s a diploid.  It has the two chromosomes that are 
relevant that carry the S gene and the Y gene.  And the parent is 
heterozygous for both.  It’s a double heterozygote.  Big S, little S, big 
Y, little Y.  OK? 

Now, when this individual undergoes meiosis, it can generate four 
possible haploid gametes.  And those have the genotypes of all four 
combinations.  It can be big S, little Y, big S, big Y, little S, little Y, 
little S, big Y.  All four possibilities.  And based on the simple laws of 
probability that we just went through with the coins, those are 
generated in equal amounts amongst the gametes. 

OK?  They’re generated in equal amounts amongst the gametes.  Why 
are they?  Well, let me just show you another slide that illustrates it in 
slightly more detail.  When these guys undergo the first, undergo 
duplication to generate the two chromatids for each chromosomes, 
enter prophase of meiosis one, the homologs pair, as you recall. 

The two chromosomes don’t have anything to do with one another. 
The homologs pair but the two chromosomes don’t have anything to 
do with one another.  They’re independent of each other.  Now, if we 
consider this chromosome, the one that carries the S gene, it will line 
up on the metaphase plate in an orientation which is random.  In this 
particular example, the big S allele is pointing down and the little S 
allele is pointing up.  OK? 

Based on that, let’s fix that.  Based on that there is one of two possible 
alignments for the chromosome that carries the other gene.  In our 
example it’s the Y gene.  One orientation would have the big Y 
carrying chromosome pointing up, but it’s just as likely that that 
chromosome could end up the other way around such that the big Y 
carrying chromosome is pointing down. 

And it’s based on the fact that the two chromosomes are independent 
of one another when they choose which side of the metaphase plate to 
go to that gives us this random assortment in meiosis and the 
development of Mendel’s Second Law.  So if you carry this through 
then you generate these gametes in a 2:2:2:2 or 1:1:1:1 ratio.  OK? 
That’s the most important thing.  If you understand that then you can 
work it out as to which genotypes you get and which phenotypes you 
get using Punnett Squares. 

OK?  But it’s important that you understand why it is that you get 
random assortment of the alleles in such a cross.  Is that clear to 
everybody?  It’s probably not clear to the guy reading the newspaper. 
Oh, the woman reading the newspaper.  Usually it’s a guy reading the 
newspaper but not today.  Is this clear?  Are there any questions?  OK. 

As I said, you can work through this with Punnett Squares.  I decided 
not to do it on the board because it takes a lot of time, but the book 
shows you, in this specific example, what you should expect.  Here are 
the two parentals.  They’re homozygous for each of the alleles, big S, 
big S, big Y, big Y, little S, little S, little Y, little Y.  In the F1 
generation you create the double heterozygote, big S, little S, big Y, 
little Y, and then that generates the four gametes in equal proportion, 
as we just discussed. 

If you cross two of these F1s together then you can create a Punnett 
Square which now has 16 squares instead of just four which allows us 
to consider the products of all four of these gametes crossed to all four 
of these gametes.  So we get various combinations of genotypes and 
we get various combinations of phenotypes.  And you can calculate 
what those are based on looking at this.  There’s actually another way 
of doing it, which I find to be simpler, which is illustrated here. 

Again, because the traits and the alleles are segregating from one 
another independently you can think about this as two Punnett 
Squares separately and figure out the consequences of those two traits 
by simply multiplying between then.  So what I mean by that is if you 
consider the S allele in isolation then there are the familiar 1:2:1 ratio 
of the three different genotypes. 

And that’s true also of the Y genotypes, 1:2:1 of the three possible 
genotypes.  In total there are nine possible genotypes, but when you 
separate it from S and Y it’s 3:3.  Likewise with respect to the 
phenotypes, three-quarters of these guys will be smooth, one-quarter 

will be wrinkled.  And over here three-quarters will be yellow, one-
quarter will be green.  If I want to figure out what the frequency is of 
any compound genotype, I just have to multiply across. 

So if I want to know the frequency of big S, big S, big Y, big Y, and it’s 
just the product of a quarter times a quarter or a sixteenth, just like 
the coins example by the way.  If I want to know the frequency of 
being big S, little S, big Y, little Y, then it’s a half times a half or four-
sixteenths, sorry.  A half times a half or a quarter which equals four 
sixteenths. 

And the other genotypes comprise the remaining sixteenths that we 
see, another 11.  And likewise with respect to phenotypes.  If you 
want to know the frequency of smooth yellow offspring you just 
multiple across, three-quarters times three-quarters gives you nine-
sixteenth.  Of wrinkled green ones it’s a quarter times a quarter or 
one-sixteenth.  So, again, when you’re asked to do Punnett Squares 
for two traits that segregate independently, you might think about 
doing it using separate Punnett Squares. 

OK.  So we’ve talked about Mendel’s Laws.  We’re wrapping up 
Mendel’s Laws here.  The first law is independent segregation of the 
two alleles.  The second law with respect to different genes, they 
segregate independently from each other.  OK? 

Now, as I said, this is true for genes that are on different 
chromosomes or actually genes that are far away on the same 
chromosome, but it’s not always true.  And to emphasize that point 
we’re going to return to our coin friends. 

So let me just remind you, let me just remind you what we saw.  So 
this doesn’t apply to genes that are linked together on the same 
chromosome. 

Let’s remind you what we determined for genes that are unlinked, the 
dime and the penny.  We said that the frequency of getting in my left 
hand head, head and in my right hand head, head, and together was 
1:4 and 1:4 and together was 1:16.  That was the situation when they 
were independent of one another.  But let’s consider the situation 
when I’ve taped them together.  Now I have a penny and a quarter 
which are taped together. 

I have fixed the orientation of these two coins with respect to one 
another.  So you can see the heads are on the same side, the heads 

are on the same side, yeah?  OK.  What’s the likelihood that this is 
going to have the penny in the head configuration?  1:2.  And if it is 
what’s the likelihood that the quarter is going to be in the head 
configuration? 

One.  So what’s the likelihood that the coin is going to have head, 
head when I turned it up?  1:2.  Not like this example.  1:2.  And so 
what’s the likelihood that it’s going to be head, head in this 
configuration, in this hand?  1:2.  So what’s the likelihood that it’s 
going to be head, head, head, head?  1:4.  So the frequencies don’t 
work out, according to Mendel’s Rules, if the two genes are linked, the 
two genes are linked together. 

So thank you for your help.  It pays to sit in the front row every once 
in a while.  So this is what we just talked about.  In my left hand the 
frequency of head, head was one-half, in my right hand frequency of 
head, head was one-half, so the product was a half times a half or a 
quarter.  OK?  Now, if we want to think about that is sort of genetic 
terms, let’s think about chromosomes. 

And genes can be linked on chromosomes like those two coins can be 
linked together by tape.  So here are two genes, the penny gene and 
the quarter gene, two alleles, the head allele and the tail allele, and 
they’re present on two chromosomes in a heterozygous individual. 
And they’re in this configuration such that the head allele of the 
quarter is next to the head allele of the penny.  The tail allele of the 
quarter is next to the tail allele of the penny. 

When this goes through meiosis the alleles stick together.  The head 
alleles stick together in the gametes.  The tail alleles stick together in 
the gametes.  It’s just like Mary Had a Little Lamb.  Remember that 
one?  I’m getting curious looks.  Mary had a little lamb.  Its fleece was 
white as snow.  Everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go. 
A long way to go for that one, but anyway. 

Everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.  They stay 
linked.  OK?  And importantly you don’t find, or you almost never find 
this situation where the quarter in the head, sorry, the penny in the 
head configuration went with the quarter in the tail configuration.  You 
don’t find those, or you almost never, and this is the point of the final 
phase of the lecture.  OK.  Very good. 

So let’s look at this with respect to peas.  Why not?  We’re going to 
talk about now linked genes in peas.  We’re going to talk about two 
genes. 

We’re going to have our familiar Y gene which has its two alleles.  And 
now we’re going to talk about a new gene, the D gene, which likewise 
has two alleles and two phenotypes which are dense peas and light 
peas.  OK?  Dense peas and light peas.  And it turns out that these two 
genes are on the same chromosome and very close to one another. 

So if you think about the chromosomes in a heterozygous individual, 
double heterozygous individual they would look like that.  If we think 
about the chromosomes in a tester strain, which is homozygous for the 
recessive alleles for both. 

What’s going to happen to the offspring?  What?  What?  I’m sorry. 
First of all, this phenotype is yellow and dense.  Big D is dominant over 
little D.  This phenotype is green and light. 

OK?  What do the gametes look like in this Punnett Square?  And why 
am I drawing four boxes, only four boxes anyway?  Didn’t I tell you a 
little while ago that if you have two alleles, two genes you have to 
draw a Punnett Square with 16 boxes?  Why am I drawing only four? 
Because they go together.  They’re linked.  So what do the alleles look 
like? 

Well, this parent is going to give either big Y, big D or little Y, little D. 
And this parent is always only ever going to give little Y, little D.  OK? 
So therefore the genotype follows, sorry. 

And the phenotype.  What am I going to get when I deconvolute this? 
What am I going to get?  The phenotype in that cross, 50% will be 
yellow dense.  And 50% will be what?  Green and light. 

The very same two phenotypes that I got in the parents.  These are 
the parental phenotypes. 

And in a test cross like this, of two genes that are very tightly linked, 
you would always regenerate the parental phenotypes.  They would 
never separate from one another.  You’d always only ever generate 
the parental --
