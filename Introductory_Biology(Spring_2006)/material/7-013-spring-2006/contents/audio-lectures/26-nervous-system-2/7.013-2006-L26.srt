1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
We're going to talk about the
nervous, and continue to talk about

2
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
the nervous system.
And in the game board of life and

3
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
our journey through life we are well
into the course.

4
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
We've talked about the foundations,
where things come from.  And now

5
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
we're talking about how different
organs work together in the system

6
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
module.  We'll talk about the
nervous system.

7
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
Professor Jacks will move on into
the immune system,

8
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
probably not immediately after,
but later into the immune system.

9
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
And you're going to get a broader
perspective on how things work in a

10
00:00:53 --> 00:00:57
biology sense.
So we talked last time about the

11
00:00:57 --> 00:01:02
notion of the nervous system and how
the nervous system is really a

12
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
wiring diagram,
a circuit.  And it's actually,

13
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
the circuitry in the nervous system,
if you were to take wires and

14
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
connectors and connect it up is very
simple.  What's not simple is that

15
00:01:18 --> 00:01:24
the circuit is incredibly complex.
Enormous, of enormous complexity.

16
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
And what's also not simple is that
unlike many electrical circuits,

17
00:01:29 --> 00:01:34
it's a very flexible circuit.
And, unlike most electrical circuits,

18
00:01:34 --> 00:01:39
it learns.  It's plastic.
It learns from its mistakes and it

19
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
learns from its triumphs.
And that's where the difference

20
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
comes in.  We talked last time about
neurons as the wires of the nervous

21
00:01:48 --> 00:01:53
system.  And today I want to talk
about synapses,

22
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
or you might hear them pronounced
synapses, but this is an

23
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
unusual pronunciation.
Synapses, which are the connectors

24
00:02:03 --> 00:02:09
between the different wires.
And then next time we'll talk about

25
00:02:09 --> 00:02:15
how these things are all put
together into circuits.

26
00:02:15 --> 00:02:21
And that will be in our lecture on
Friday.  Actually,

27
00:02:21 --> 00:02:27
Claudette, did you want me to make
an announcement about what you have

28
00:02:27 --> 00:02:32
on the board there?
Can you guys see this?

29
00:02:32 --> 00:02:36
I can read it.  It says RO6
Lesley's 10:00 AM,

30
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
R16 Kyle's 11:00 AM.
Go to 8119 tomorrow and next

31
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
Thursday.  OK?
So if you are in Kyle's or Lesley's

32
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
section, please note what is on the
board.  OK.  So what about the

33
00:02:49 --> 00:02:54
number of connections?
So this is a staggering figure.

34
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
So the figure of the number of
cells in our body ranges between ten

35
00:02:58 --> 00:03:03
to the twelfth and ten
to the thirteenth.

36
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
The number of neurons that are
estimated to be in the brain is

37
00:03:07 --> 00:03:16
about ten to the tenth.

38
00:03:16 --> 00:03:22
Each neuron can make about ten to
the third, a thousand synapses.

39
00:03:22 --> 00:03:36
But in some neurons there can be

40
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
even more than that.
There can be about, there can be up

41
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
to about ten to the fifth
connections between neurons.

42
00:03:46 --> 00:03:51
And if you start doing some simple
math you can get to a realization

43
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
that the complexity of the circuitry
that you can get between neurons,

44
00:03:56 --> 00:04:02
just within the brain, is really
staggering.  OK?

45
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
And it's way beyond our
understanding right now to figure

46
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
out how you get,
at least these ten to the third

47
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
connections, ten to the thirteenth
connections.  But wait.

48
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
It may be a couple of orders of
magnitude more than that,

49
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
how you get those set up and how you
get them maintained.

50
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
So let's try to simplify the
problem a bit and talk about the

51
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
connections between neurons because
that is a much simpler question than

52
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
how you get this enormous number of
circuits set up as you wire

53
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
the nervous system.
This is a simple circuit that I took

54
00:04:39 --> 00:04:44
from your book.
A diagram of a simple circuit that

55
00:04:44 --> 00:04:49
I took from your book,
motor neurons that are in the spinal

56
00:04:49 --> 00:04:54
cord innervate the leg muscle.
Sensory neurons that are in the leg

57
00:04:54 --> 00:04:59
muscle innervate the spinal cord,
and there is connectivity between

58
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
the muscle, this sensory neuron and
the motor neurons in the spinal cord

59
00:05:04 --> 00:05:09
that give you the classic reflex
when the doctor taps your knee.

60
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
I don't even know.
I guess they do that when you're

61
00:05:13 --> 00:05:18
little, not when you're older,
unless you look like you're in bad

62
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
shape.  But that is a simple reflex
arch that has a number of

63
00:05:22 --> 00:05:27
connections between neurons but
accountable number of connections,

64
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32
just a few kinds of synapses.
So let's talk about the synapse.

65
00:05:32 --> 00:05:37
And I'm going to do some board work
here and give you a sense of what

66
00:05:37 --> 00:05:42
the wiring in the nervous system
looks like and where these

67
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
connections take place.
And one needs to consider some kind

68
00:05:47 --> 00:05:52
of input which can be from a neuron
or it can be from some kind of

69
00:05:52 --> 00:05:57
external stimulus like light or the
food you eat. And this input

70
00:05:57 --> 00:06:03
interfaces with sensory neurons,
hence the name sensing.

71
00:06:03 --> 00:06:09
Sensory neurons generally connect to
things called interneurons which are

72
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
wires that connect one part of the
nervous system to another.

73
00:06:15 --> 00:06:22
These connect to motor neurons.
And motor neurons are the things

74
00:06:22 --> 00:06:28
that direct what the output is going
to be, muscle contraction,

75
00:06:28 --> 00:06:35
swallowing, etc.
Wherever there is a connection

76
00:06:35 --> 00:06:46
between neurons there is a synapse.

77
00:06:46 --> 00:06:53
And often, especially in the case of
muscle, there can be a synapse

78
00:06:53 --> 00:07:00
between motor neurons
and their output.

79
00:07:00 --> 00:07:06
There are two kinds of connections
between neurons,

80
00:07:06 --> 00:07:12
two kinds of synapses.
There are those that are electrical

81
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
where the electrical input from the
axon of one neuron is transferred to

82
00:07:18 --> 00:07:24
the next neuron,
and you keep the signal an electric

83
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
one.  Electrical synapses
are very rapid.

84
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
They involve things called GAP
junctions, which we've talked about

85
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
briefly, which are direct
connections between cells.

86
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
And you get direct movement of ions
between cells.

87
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
And electrical synapses are used at
some points in the Animal Kingdom.

88
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
And they are, in fact, used in our
nervous system,

89
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
particularly when it's developing.
This is new work.  But the type of

90
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
synapse that is much more prevalent
is the chemical synapse.

91
00:07:56 --> 00:08:03
Chemical synapses are relatively

92
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
slow.  So electrical synapses are
extremely rapid and they are almost

93
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
instantaneous.
You get the action potential moving

94
00:08:13 --> 00:08:18
down an axon, moves across the
synapse, and there is really no

95
00:08:18 --> 00:08:23
break in the sequence or in the
timing of the movement of the signal.

96
00:08:23 --> 00:08:28
Chemical synapses are slower.
And there is a lag of milliseconds

97
00:08:28 --> 00:08:33
to minutes, in some cases,
from the receipt of the signal at

98
00:08:33 --> 00:08:38
the one side of the synapse to its
transference to the other

99
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
side of the synapse.
So mini-seconds.

100
00:08:43 --> 00:08:49
That should say seconds,
S-E-C, to minutes.  And the thing

101
00:08:49 --> 00:08:54
about them, about chemical synapses
that makes them so attractive is

102
00:08:54 --> 00:09:00
that you can regulate them in
various ways.  So I'll

103
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
say regulatable.
And I'm going to spend this lecture

104
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
talking about chemical synapses and
not about electrical synapses.

105
00:09:09 --> 00:09:14
If you're interested in knowing
more about electrical synapses,

106
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
email me and I'll direct you to some
literature that will be of interest

107
00:09:18 --> 00:09:23
to you.  So let me draw on the board
the essence of a synapse.

108
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
And let's draw, and you should draw
it at the same time.

109
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
And so let's draw the axon of one
neuron.

110
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
So this is neuron one and this is
its axon.  And here's another neuron.

111
00:09:38 --> 00:09:45
And this is going to be a part of
the neuron termed [the 41?

112
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
.  I have a new item.  I have a new
item as an incentive.

113
00:09:51 --> 00:09:58
I have, since it's getting to be
summer, I have a clownfish,

114
00:09:58 --> 00:10:05
a clownfish squirt.
You will need a bottle of water to

115
00:10:05 --> 00:10:12
use this item.
OK.  What part of the next neuron

116
00:10:12 --> 00:10:20
is the axon going to connect to?
Isn't it the dendrites?  It is

117
00:10:20 --> 00:10:27
indeed the dendrite.
Yes.  Thank you.  OK.

118
00:10:27 --> 00:10:35
OK.  So here is neuron two and the
dendrite.

119
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
And what is going to happen is stuff
that is really not specific to the

120
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
nervous system,
except in the details.

121
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
It is stuff that you've heard about
in cell biology,

122
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
that we've talked about in the
formation module,

123
00:10:51 --> 00:10:55
and it involves receptor ligand
interactions and signal transduction

124
00:10:55 --> 00:11:02
but in a specialized way.
Here comes the action potential,

125
00:11:02 --> 00:11:10
hereafter abbreviated AP, coming
down neuron one.

126
00:11:10 --> 00:11:18
And that action potential,
as you remember, is driven by

127
00:11:18 --> 00:11:26
transient depolarization and inward
sodium current.

128
00:11:26 --> 00:11:34
At the very terminal of this axon,
which is called the presynaptic

129
00:11:34 --> 00:11:42
terminal or the presynaptic cell,
there is a system of vesicles.  And

130
00:11:42 --> 00:11:50
these vesicles contain stuff called
neurotransmitter,

131
00:11:50 --> 00:11:59
which we'll talk more about in a
moment.

132
00:11:59 --> 00:12:09
And on the opposite cell,

133
00:12:09 --> 00:12:15
which has the name of the
postsynaptic cell,

134
00:12:15 --> 00:12:21
on its membrane are things that
we've talked about many

135
00:12:21 --> 00:12:33
times, receptors.

136
00:12:33 --> 00:12:38
And this is the deal.
The action potential moves along

137
00:12:38 --> 00:12:44
the axon of the presynaptic cell.
As it gets towards the terminus of

138
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
the presynaptic cell,
you can call that the presynaptic

139
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
terminus also,
it activates another set of channels.

140
00:12:56 --> 00:13:02
These are calcium channels that
give an inward calcium flow,

141
00:13:02 --> 00:13:08
an inward calcium ion flux that
causes these vesicles to fuse with

142
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
the presynaptic membrane in the
process that you learned about in

143
00:13:14 --> 00:13:22
cell biology called exocytosis.

144
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
And these presynaptic vesicles
disgorge their contents,

145
00:13:28 --> 00:13:35
their neurotransmitter into the
space between the presynaptic cell

146
00:13:35 --> 00:13:41
and the postsynaptic cell.
This space is called the synaptic

147
00:13:41 --> 00:13:48
cleft or the presynaptic cleft.
It doesn't matter.  Well, it does

148
00:13:48 --> 00:13:54
matter.  You should know that,
but it's just a space.  And it's a

149
00:13:54 --> 00:14:01
space that is usually about ten to
twenty nanometers.

150
00:14:01 --> 00:14:06
So it's a fairly substantial space.
And that neurotransmitter diffuses

151
00:14:06 --> 00:14:12
across the space,
binds to receptors and signal

152
00:14:12 --> 00:14:18
transduction happens.
And we'll talk about what the

153
00:14:18 --> 00:14:24
signal transduction is and what the
outcome may be.

154
00:14:24 --> 00:14:30
And the outcome may be an action
potential, but it is not guaranteed

155
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
to be an action potential.
And the thing about chemical

156
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
synapses that makes them slow is
that there is a diffusion driven

157
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
process.  The stuff has to,
these neurotransmitter molecules

158
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
have to diffuse across the synaptic
cleft, and that takes time.

159
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
And that is why chemical synapses
is slow.  You also have to get

160
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
exocytosis of those vesicles,
and that is slow as well.  All right.

161
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
So synaptic density.
Here's a slide to show you synaptic

162
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
density.  Increase in synaptic
density during development is really

163
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
extraordinary.
And the number of synapses and the

164
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
type of synapses changes in
childhood but also throughout life.

165
00:15:09 --> 00:15:14
This is a movie to illustrate what
I've told you.

166
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
You can look at it again.
And graphically here's your

167
00:15:18 --> 00:15:23
electrical message being transferred
into a chemical message,

168
00:15:23 --> 00:15:28
and then recreating an electrical
message.

169
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
So there's change in the
transduction mechanism of this

170
00:15:32 --> 00:15:37
particular, oh,
it's supposed to be a loop but I

171
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
guess it's not,
in this particular mechanism of

172
00:15:41 --> 00:15:46
transmission.  Here are the
presynaptic vesicles disgorging

173
00:15:46 --> 00:15:51
their neurotransmitter.
Look in this case, the

174
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
neurotransmitter is going back into
the vesicles.  And we'll talk about

175
00:15:55 --> 00:16:03
this more in a moment.  OK.

176
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
Item one on your handout today is a
diagram from your book,

177
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
which shows you the synapse,
the presynaptic cell, the

178
00:16:11 --> 00:16:16
postsynaptic cell.
You'll get all the information that

179
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
I have put on the board in a more
complicated way.

180
00:16:20 --> 00:16:25
And this is done for a cell that
has got something called acetyl-CoA

181
00:16:25 --> 00:16:29
in it.  OK.  So you can bear that in
mind.  I want to address a number of

182
00:16:29 --> 00:16:34
issues now, a number of issues now.
And I want to point out a diagram,

183
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
actually, let me go back to this one,
number one on your handout.

184
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
One thing I would like you to look
at and to think about and to compare

185
00:16:42 --> 00:16:47
with your cell biology module is the
exocytosis of these vesicles.

186
00:16:47 --> 00:16:51
So you talked about transport of
molecules around the cell,

187
00:16:51 --> 00:16:55
particularly proteins, and you
talked some about exocytosis

188
00:16:55 --> 00:17:00
and endocytosis.
The exocytosis of these

189
00:17:00 --> 00:17:05
neurotransmitter vesicles is a
classic example of exocytosis.

190
00:17:05 --> 00:17:10
The proteins involved in this are
the same proteins involved in

191
00:17:10 --> 00:17:15
exocytosis in many different cell
types.  In addition,

192
00:17:15 --> 00:17:20
there's a process I'll mention later
on of endocytosis where the

193
00:17:20 --> 00:17:25
neurotransmitter may be taken back
up into the cell and used again.

194
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
On your handout that's on the Web
is this diagram.

195
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
You can look at it in more detail.
I'm not going to dwell on it here.

196
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
You can look at it in more detail.
It will indicate where calcium comes

197
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
into the triggered exocytosis of the
neuro transmitter.

198
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
But moving right on,
I want to talk to you now about

199
00:17:46 --> 00:18:00
neurotransmitters.

200
00:18:00 --> 00:18:06
Neurotransmitters,
the ligands that transfer a signal

201
00:18:06 --> 00:18:17
from one neuron to another.

202
00:18:17 --> 00:18:22
Here are some facts.
Any kind of neuron can make more

203
00:18:22 --> 00:18:27
than one neurotransmitter.
And different neurotransmitters are

204
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
usually in different vesicles.
And they can be used at different

205
00:18:33 --> 00:18:40
times and different places in the
neuron where it synapses onto

206
00:18:40 --> 00:18:47
another neuron.
Neurotransmitters are typically

207
00:18:47 --> 00:18:54
three things, and you'll be
surprised at what some of them are.

208
00:18:54 --> 00:19:01
It's very interesting.  They can be
nucleosides, they can be amino acids,

209
00:19:01 --> 00:19:10
and they can be peptides.

210
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
Let that on the table here.
All right.  So here are some

211
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
neurotransmitters.
Most of these, you can go and look

212
00:19:18 --> 00:19:22
at these later.
Most of these come from amino acids.

213
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
Acetylcholine which is one of the
largest most important

214
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
neurotransmitters does not,
but the other ones do.

215
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
They come from glycine from
glutamate, tyrosine,

216
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
tryptophan, and so on.
And that monosodium glutamate that

217
00:19:38 --> 00:19:42
you have often on food,
on Asian food that makes the food

218
00:19:42 --> 00:19:47
taste better, the reason it makes
the food taste better is that it's a

219
00:19:47 --> 00:19:51
neurotransmitter and it increases
synaptic transmission across some of

220
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
the neurons that are involved and
taste perception.

221
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
So, yeah.  All right,
so neurotransmitters.

222
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
Peptides, amino acids and
nucleosides.  It's very interesting

223
00:20:04 --> 00:20:09
that these ligands are very small.
Amino acids are very small.

224
00:20:09 --> 00:20:14
Nucleosides are very small.
And it's interesting that these are

225
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
used as neurotransmitters.
And I think there are two reasons.

226
00:20:18 --> 00:20:23
One of the reasons is that because
they're small they diffuse

227
00:20:23 --> 00:20:28
relatively rapidly,
and so they minimize the time of

228
00:20:28 --> 00:20:33
getting the synapse in the
postsynaptic cell activated.

229
00:20:33 --> 00:20:36
And also because nerve cells are
evolutionarily very ancient.

230
00:20:36 --> 00:20:40
These were the molecules that were
around at the time,

231
00:20:40 --> 00:20:44
and perhaps they were around at a
time where it was easiest to use

232
00:20:44 --> 00:20:48
things that were preexisting.
So in some ancestral cell, which we

233
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
don't really understand,
perhaps before there was a very

234
00:20:52 --> 00:20:56
large protein cohort and cells
wanted to communicate with one

235
00:20:56 --> 00:21:00
another, a very ancestral
type cell.

236
00:21:00 --> 00:21:04
These were the types of things that
would have been around.

237
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
And these, perhaps there's an
evolutionary reason that these

238
00:21:08 --> 00:21:12
things are used as neurotransmitters.
There are a vast number of

239
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
neurotransmitters.
There are about 25 known

240
00:21:16 --> 00:21:20
neurotransmitters,
and they have different functions.

241
00:21:20 --> 00:21:24
So the two big classes you should
know about are the ones that are

242
00:21:24 --> 00:21:29
excitatory and the ones
that are inhibitory.

243
00:21:29 --> 00:21:35
And we'll talk about this in detail
in a moment, but excitatory

244
00:21:35 --> 00:21:42
neurotransmitters are ones which
will promote an action potential in

245
00:21:42 --> 00:21:49
the postsynaptic cell.
And, in fact, the major one in the

246
00:21:49 --> 00:21:55
central nervous system is glutamate.
And the major one that works

247
00:21:55 --> 00:22:02
between your nerve cells and your
muscles, at the neuromuscular

248
00:22:02 --> 00:22:11
junction, is acetylcholine.

249
00:22:11 --> 00:22:15
And then there are inhibitory
neurotransmitters,

250
00:22:15 --> 00:22:19
and these are the ones which will
tend to inhibit an action potential

251
00:22:19 --> 00:22:23
from taking place in the
postsynaptic cell.

252
00:22:23 --> 00:22:27
And one of the major ones there is
gamma-aminobutyric acid,

253
00:22:27 --> 00:22:32
abbreviated GABA.
And another one is glycine.

254
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
And those are both found in the
central nervous system.

255
00:22:36 --> 00:22:41
However, I'm going to also add to
this inhibitory list acetylcholine,

256
00:22:41 --> 00:22:46
which will indicate an important
principle you should understand.

257
00:22:46 --> 00:22:50
And you'll see it gets more and
more complicated,

258
00:22:50 --> 00:22:55
that neurotransmitters can either be
excitatory or they can be inhibitory

259
00:22:55 --> 00:23:00
depending on the receptors
to which they bind.

260
00:23:00 --> 00:23:04
This is a table from your book.
You should look at it.  You do not

261
00:23:04 --> 00:23:08
need to memorize what each of these
neurotransmitters does,

262
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
but you should become familiar with
their names.  And you will be

263
00:23:12 --> 00:23:17
interested to read what some of them
do.  And I'll come back to a couple

264
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
of them later.
I'll come back to acetylcholine,

265
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
already mentioned.  Serotonin which
is involved in promoting

266
00:23:25 --> 00:23:30
good mood.
And I'll also talk about adenosine

267
00:23:30 --> 00:23:35
as something that you affect every
morning when you drink a cup of

268
00:23:35 --> 00:23:40
coffee.  But before we get there,
let's talk about receptors.

269
00:23:40 --> 00:23:54
And let me introduce you to two

270
00:23:54 --> 00:24:00
classes of receptors that you should
be familiar with.

271
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
So you could imagine,
as we've been talking about,

272
00:24:05 --> 00:24:10
that the receptors for these
neurotransmitters could directly

273
00:24:10 --> 00:24:15
influence an action potential in the
next cell by allowing ions in or out

274
00:24:15 --> 00:24:20
of the cell.  And,
in fact, I'm going to add it to your

275
00:24:20 --> 00:24:25
first diagram.
A lot of the receptors have

276
00:24:25 --> 00:24:31
eventually the effect of allowing
sodium to flow in.

277
00:24:31 --> 00:24:37
But these receptors also may allow
the influx of calcium or they may

278
00:24:37 --> 00:24:43
allow the efflux,
the removal of chloride.

279
00:24:43 --> 00:24:49
And we'll talk more about this and
I've got diagrams for you in a

280
00:24:49 --> 00:24:55
moment.  So the receptors in general
have got something to do with ion

281
00:24:55 --> 00:25:02
channels.  And they can either be
ion channels themselves directly.

282
00:25:02 --> 00:25:09
And in this case they get the name
ionotropic receptors or they can be

283
00:25:09 --> 00:25:16
indirect and they can influence the
activity of ion channels in an

284
00:25:16 --> 00:25:23
indirect way.  And in this case they
are called metabotropic.

285
00:25:23 --> 00:25:38
Metabotropic.

286
00:25:38 --> 00:25:43
OK.  So the end result is that ion
channel activity is changed.

287
00:25:43 --> 00:25:49
Ionotropic receptors, because they
are the ion channels respond to

288
00:25:49 --> 00:25:54
neurotransmitters very rapidly.
Within the millisecond timeframe,

289
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
metabotropic receptors are much
slower and they respond much more

290
00:26:00 --> 00:26:06
slowly within the second
to minute range.

291
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
And the deal with metabotropic
receptors, I'll talk about both of

292
00:26:11 --> 00:26:16
them with pictures in a moment.
The deal with metabotropic

293
00:26:16 --> 00:26:21
receptors is that between the
receptor ligand interaction and

294
00:26:21 --> 00:26:27
activation of the ion channel,
so the ligand will bind a

295
00:26:27 --> 00:26:32
metabotropic receptor.
And the metabotropic receptor will

296
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
then very often activate the system
of G-proteins that you've talked

297
00:26:36 --> 00:26:40
about previously.
And those G-proteins will then

298
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
activate downstream ion channels.
Here's an example of the

299
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
acetylcholine receptor,
which was the first receptor,

300
00:26:49 --> 00:26:53
neurotransmitter receptor to be
purified.  This is an ionotropic

301
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57
receptor.  It's a complex of
multiple subunits.

302
00:26:57 --> 00:27:01
And it works in a way that we
talked about long ago when we talked

303
00:27:01 --> 00:27:06
about enzymes.
And we talked about allosteric

304
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
activation of enzymes.
Remember that way back when?

305
00:27:10 --> 00:27:15
Something binds to a protein and
changes its confirmation and changes

306
00:27:15 --> 00:27:19
the activity of the protein.
That's exactly what happens here.

307
00:27:19 --> 00:27:24
Acetylcholine binds to the receptor
in defined places,

308
00:27:24 --> 00:27:28
it changes the confirmation of
various subunits,

309
00:27:28 --> 00:27:33
and going from a closed channel it
now opens this channel.

310
00:27:33 --> 00:27:36
So this is a gated channel.
OK?  It's a gated channel in the

311
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
same way that the sodium channel we
talked about was gated,

312
00:27:40 --> 00:27:43
but it's gated not by voltage but by
neurotransmitter binding.

313
00:27:43 --> 00:27:47
All right?  That is the definition
of gated.  It can be gated by

314
00:27:47 --> 00:27:50
anything.  So this is the
acetylcholine receptor.

315
00:27:50 --> 00:27:54
It's also called the nicotinic
receptor because it is the thing

316
00:27:54 --> 00:27:58
that binds nicotine,
and can be activated by binding of

317
00:27:58 --> 00:28:02
nicotine.
Metabotropic receptors activate ion

318
00:28:02 --> 00:28:06
channels.  Here is something from
your book.  And I have these on your

319
00:28:06 --> 00:28:11
handout.  So these are number two
and three on your handout.

320
00:28:11 --> 00:28:15
Here is the neurotransmitter
binding a receptor,

321
00:28:15 --> 00:28:20
interacting with various G-proteins,
hydrolysis of GTP.  One of the

322
00:28:20 --> 00:28:25
subunits goes off,
and through a series of events opens

323
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
up another ion channel that is not
linked physically to

324
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
the receptor.
Metabotropic receptors.

325
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
Now, interestingly, and here is
another note you can make,

326
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
a neurotransmitter can either
activate an ionotropic or a

327
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
metabotropic or both types of
receptors.  Acetylcholine is

328
00:28:46 --> 00:28:51
ionotropic.  It can also be
metabotropic.  In hot muscle there

329
00:28:51 --> 00:28:55
are these things called muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors,

330
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59
and they are responsible for slowing
down or speeding up the contraction

331
00:28:59 --> 00:29:04
of the heart muscle.
So there is a lesson there.

332
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
Receptors can be either or both
ionotropic or metabotropic.

333
00:29:10 --> 00:29:20
So up on the top board I've

334
00:29:20 --> 00:29:26
mentioned the terms excitatory and
inhibitory.  Let's go back to them

335
00:29:26 --> 00:29:32
and let's talk about excitatory
versus inhibitory synapses.

336
00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
So the deal is this.

337
00:29:38 --> 00:29:42
You've got your signal coming along,
you've got your next cell,

338
00:29:42 --> 00:29:46
or you've got your signal coming
along, you've got your next cell

339
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
here, you're passing the information
to the next cell.

340
00:29:50 --> 00:29:54
And the question that that next
cell is trying to answer is should I

341
00:29:54 --> 00:29:58
fire an action potential?
That is the only question it is

342
00:29:58 --> 00:30:02
capable of answering.
That is the only output that has

343
00:30:02 --> 00:30:07
real relevance for a cell,
OK, is whether or not it's going to

344
00:30:07 --> 00:30:12
fire an action potential and
transmit the nervous information

345
00:30:12 --> 00:30:17
along the pathway of the nervous
system.  And in order to decide that

346
00:30:17 --> 00:30:22
there are two things that can happen.
Neurotransmitter receptor

347
00:30:22 --> 00:30:27
interaction can promote,
can facilitate, can make easier an

348
00:30:27 --> 00:30:33
action potential to happen in the
postsynaptic cell --

349
00:30:33 --> 00:30:38
-- or can inhibit an action
potential from occurring in the

350
00:30:38 --> 00:30:43
postsynaptic cell.
So let's go back to our discussion

351
00:30:43 --> 00:30:48
from last week where we talked about
resting potential,

352
00:30:48 --> 00:30:53
threshold potential and so on.
And let me give you some

353
00:30:53 --> 00:30:58
information.  The threshold
potential is constant.

354
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
For one fish, could somebody please
define for me the threshold

355
00:31:02 --> 00:31:07
potential somewhere up here?
Threshold potential.  Yeah.  Yes,

356
00:31:07 --> 00:31:11
you're correct.  The threshold
potential is around negative 50

357
00:31:11 --> 00:31:16
millivolts where outside is more
positive than inside.

358
00:31:16 --> 00:31:20
What is this threshold potential?
What happens when you cross it?

359
00:31:20 --> 00:31:25
Yeah?  And action potential is
created.  Right.

360
00:31:25 --> 00:31:29
Good.  OK.  So one first for you.
And see me for another fish later

361
00:31:29 --> 00:31:34
on.  You came up here with one.
OK.  The threshold potential,

362
00:31:34 --> 00:31:38
the point of no return at which the
action potential is going to take

363
00:31:38 --> 00:31:43
place is constant from cell to cell.
It doesn't change.  What can change

364
00:31:43 --> 00:31:53
is the resting potential.

365
00:31:53 --> 00:31:58
And excitatory and inhibitory
synapses act upon the resting

366
00:31:58 --> 00:32:04
potential and bring the resting
potential closer or further away

367
00:32:04 --> 00:32:09
from the threshold potential.
So excitatory synapses and the

368
00:32:09 --> 00:32:15
interaction of neurotransmitters
with the receptors inhibit,

369
00:32:15 --> 00:32:21
OK, excitatory synapses will bring
the resting potential closer to the

370
00:32:21 --> 00:32:27
threshold potential.
They'll make it easier for an

371
00:32:27 --> 00:32:34
action potential to take place.
So they increase the resting

372
00:32:34 --> 00:32:42
potential.  RP for resting potential.
Inhibitory synapses decrease the

373
00:32:42 --> 00:32:50
resting potential and make it harder
to get to the threshold potential.

374
00:32:50 --> 00:32:58
OK?  So you increase the resting
potential and you still get closer

375
00:32:58 --> 00:33:05
to TP or the threshold potential.
And you here you get further from

376
00:33:05 --> 00:33:17
the threshold potential.

377
00:33:17 --> 00:33:23
And the way you do this is by acting
on specific channels directly or

378
00:33:23 --> 00:33:29
indirectly.  If you're going to
increase the resting potential so

379
00:33:29 --> 00:33:35
that you get closer to the threshold
potential the channels involved are

380
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
sodium and calcium.
And those two ions will flow into

381
00:33:40 --> 00:33:44
the neuron.  If you are going to
decrease the resting potential,

382
00:33:44 --> 00:33:48
make it harder to get to that
threshold potential,

383
00:33:48 --> 00:33:52
you want to do the opposite.
So you could take sodium or calcium

384
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
out, but that's not how the cell
usually does it.

385
00:33:56 --> 00:34:00
The way the cell does it is to open
up chloride channels.

386
00:34:00 --> 00:34:03
There's a lot of chloride.
I'll show you some diagrams in a

387
00:34:03 --> 00:34:06
moment.  There's a lot of chloride
on the outside of the axon.

388
00:34:06 --> 00:34:10
It opens chloride channels and the
chloride will flow into the cell.

389
00:34:10 --> 00:34:16
All right.  Let's look at some

390
00:34:16 --> 00:34:19
pictures and some of the things I've
drawn for you.

391
00:34:19 --> 00:34:22
So this is a diagram from last
lecture which I drew for you.

392
00:34:22 --> 00:34:25
It shows you the action potential
and it shows you the transient

393
00:34:25 --> 00:34:28
depolarization and reversal of
charge distribution across

394
00:34:28 --> 00:34:32
the membrane.
As a couple of you pointed out to me

395
00:34:32 --> 00:34:36
this is not accurate.
Of course it's not accurate.

396
00:34:36 --> 00:34:40
It's a cartoon.  And it's not
accurate specifically because things

397
00:34:40 --> 00:34:44
aren't all or none.
It's not entirely positive outside

398
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
and entirely negative inside.
And there are a number of different

399
00:34:48 --> 00:34:52
ions involved.
So I have had a go at making it

400
00:34:52 --> 00:34:56
slightly more accurate.
And this is number four on your

401
00:34:56 --> 00:35:00
handout.  And now I've drawn it in
terms of synapses.

402
00:35:00 --> 00:35:04
It's a complicated diagram but we
can work through it.

403
00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
Outside the cell or in the synaptic
cleft.  And here's your postsynaptic

404
00:35:08 --> 00:35:12
cell.  Again, this line as
previously is the membrane.

405
00:35:12 --> 00:35:16
So here is your ion distribution.
Outside the cell there is high

406
00:35:16 --> 00:35:20
sodium.  Inside the cell low sodium
shown in red.  Inside the cell high

407
00:35:20 --> 00:35:24
potassium.  Outside relatively low
potassium.  And you remember that

408
00:35:24 --> 00:35:28
that potassium-sodium gradient is
constantly being generated by the

409
00:35:28 --> 00:35:32
sodium-potassium pump,
and then potassium is flowing

410
00:35:32 --> 00:35:37
outwards according to its gradient
through open potassium channels.

411
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
That is going on all the time.
I haven't indicated that, but

412
00:35:41 --> 00:35:45
that's going on all the time.
In addition, outside the cell are

413
00:35:45 --> 00:35:49
high levels of calcium in brown and
high levels of chloride ion shown in

414
00:35:49 --> 00:35:53
gray.  Inside the cell there are
negative charges.

415
00:35:53 --> 00:35:57
A lot of them are on proteins
rather than free ions.

416
00:35:57 --> 00:36:01
OK.  And I've shown you your
resting potential is around minus 60

417
00:36:01 --> 00:36:05
millivolts and your threshold
potential around minus 50.

418
00:36:05 --> 00:36:09
So let's look what happens at an
excitatory synapse.

419
00:36:09 --> 00:36:13
And the thing that you want to look
for are channels that will

420
00:36:13 --> 00:36:17
hypopolarize, that will make the
potential difference lower so that

421
00:36:17 --> 00:36:21
you get closer to that threshold
potential.  And the way you do that

422
00:36:21 --> 00:36:25
is to open up a series of gated
sodium channels.

423
00:36:25 --> 00:36:29
Those same voltage gated sodium
channels which we previously

424
00:36:29 --> 00:36:34
talked about.
But I should tell you that there are

425
00:36:34 --> 00:36:38
dozens of different channels that
are gated.  And different cells have

426
00:36:38 --> 00:36:42
different types of gated channels
but the idea is the same.

427
00:36:42 --> 00:36:47
These are voltage-gated sodium
channels, and they are going to

428
00:36:47 --> 00:36:51
allow an inward flow of positive
ions.  In addition,

429
00:36:51 --> 00:36:55
there are gated calcium channels
which will allow an inward flow of

430
00:36:55 --> 00:37:00
calcium.  So this is an
excitatory synapse.

431
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
And you will get here a
hypopolarization.

432
00:37:04 --> 00:37:09
Conversely, on your next handout
and number six,

433
00:37:09 --> 00:37:14
at an inhibitory synapse channels
that hypopolarize,

434
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
that make you more negative will
open.  And these particularly are

435
00:37:18 --> 00:37:23
chloride channels that will give you
an inward flow of chloride ion and

436
00:37:23 --> 00:37:28
make the inside of the postsynaptic
cell even more negative and move it

437
00:37:28 --> 00:37:33
even further away from
threshold potential.

438
00:37:33 --> 00:37:37
This is a diagram from your book I'm
not going to dwell on.

439
00:37:37 --> 00:37:41
And I want to point out here again
that I mentioned up here

440
00:37:41 --> 00:37:45
acetylcholine can either be
excitatory or inhibitory.

441
00:37:45 --> 00:37:50
At the neuromuscular junction
acetylcholine is an excitatory

442
00:37:50 --> 00:37:54
neurotransmitter.
Here it is increasing or making

443
00:37:54 --> 00:37:59
less negative the membrane
potential.

444
00:37:59 --> 00:38:04
So it is pushing you closer towards
threshold.  And here in the heart

445
00:38:04 --> 00:38:09
muscle it is acting as an inhibitory
neurotransmitter making the membrane

446
00:38:09 --> 00:38:14
potential, the resting potential
much lower.  OK.

447
00:38:14 --> 00:38:24
So I want to move on now to

448
00:38:24 --> 00:38:32
something called summation.
So we're building up the sense of

449
00:38:32 --> 00:38:36
whether a neuron,
once it makes the synapse is going

450
00:38:36 --> 00:38:40
to fire an action potential.
And that depends on this excitatory

451
00:38:40 --> 00:38:44
versus inhibitory stuff.
But there's anther wrinkle,

452
00:38:44 --> 00:38:48
and the other wrinkle is the one
that I alluded to and I've told you

453
00:38:48 --> 00:38:52
on the first board neurons make lots
of synapses.  They're not just

454
00:38:52 --> 00:38:57
making one synapse.
They're making lots of synapses.

455
00:38:57 --> 00:39:02
And the input from many synapses
needs to be added up,

456
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
needs to be summated in order that
the neuron decides whether it's

457
00:39:08 --> 00:39:13
going to fire or not.
And that summation can be two-fold.

458
00:39:13 --> 00:39:19
It can be spatial in that a number
of different neurons,

459
00:39:19 --> 00:39:24
a number of different synapses are
made with the same neuron.

460
00:39:24 --> 00:39:30
And the sum of all the changes in
the membrane potential

461
00:39:30 --> 00:39:35
are added up.
And if you get above the threshold

462
00:39:35 --> 00:39:41
potential then you fire an action
potential.  Or they can be temporal

463
00:39:41 --> 00:39:46
where over a period of millisecond
all the inputs into a neuron are

464
00:39:46 --> 00:39:51
added up.  And if at the end of that
time period you are above threshold

465
00:39:51 --> 00:39:57
potential then an action potential
fires.  This is number seven on your

466
00:39:57 --> 00:40:02
handout.  Here is an axon.
Actually, here is a neuron.

467
00:40:02 --> 00:40:06
Here are a bunch of synapses.
They've said that they're

468
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10
excitatory synapses coming into the
axon.  The synapses can actually

469
00:40:10 --> 00:40:14
occur at many different places.
In an axon they've shown them here

470
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
coming into a part of the cell body.
And there's this thing called the

471
00:40:18 --> 00:40:22
axon hillock which has got a
particular configuration of channels.

472
00:40:22 --> 00:40:26
And that's the place where the cell
often makes the decision as to

473
00:40:26 --> 00:40:30
whether it is going to fire an
action potential or not.

474
00:40:30 --> 00:40:34
But it is misleading to see these
synapses coming in all together

475
00:40:34 --> 00:40:39
because they can come in at multiple
different places on the neuron.

476
00:40:39 --> 00:40:43
OK.  So here are synapses coming in.
And you sum up the input from these.

477
00:40:43 --> 00:40:48
This is the next diagram on your
handout.  So here in a graphic way

478
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53
are a number of small changes in
membrane potential from a number of

479
00:40:53 --> 00:40:57
different synapses indicated by the
numbers here.  And these are

480
00:40:57 --> 00:41:02
summated at the axon hillock.
And then the decision as to whether

481
00:41:02 --> 00:41:06
or not you're above threshold and
whether you make an action potential

482
00:41:06 --> 00:41:10
is made.  You can also do this over
a period of time,

483
00:41:10 --> 00:41:14
again, on the millisecond time scale,
and that will tell you whether an

484
00:41:14 --> 00:41:18
action potential fires or does not
fire.  OK.  So the thing you need to

485
00:41:18 --> 00:41:22
remember is that the action
potential is the output,

486
00:41:22 --> 00:41:26
and the decision is whether you make
an action potential or not.

487
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
So the decision to make an action
potential.

488
00:41:30 --> 00:41:33
And the other thing that I should
note is your action potential is

489
00:41:33 --> 00:41:37
your action potential.
It has the same magnitude,

490
00:41:37 --> 00:41:41
and it's propagated once it starts.
What you can change is the

491
00:41:41 --> 00:41:45
frequency with which you make that
action potential.

492
00:41:45 --> 00:41:49
So you can have action potentials
arising at slow rate or you can have

493
00:41:49 --> 00:41:53
them arising very quickly.
So the decision is to make the

494
00:41:53 --> 00:41:57
action potential,
it's all or none.  I mentioned this

495
00:41:57 --> 00:42:01
last time.  But you can change the
frequency at which action

496
00:42:01 --> 00:42:07
potentials fire.

497
00:42:07 --> 00:42:16
All right.  Controlling
neurotransmitter activity.

498
00:42:16 --> 00:42:25
Neurotransmitters, here's
acetylcholine and here is atropine,

499
00:42:25 --> 00:42:35
which is an inhibitor of
acetylcholine receptor activity.

500
00:42:35 --> 00:42:39
Acetylcholine is an example of a
neurotransmitter that is made and

501
00:42:39 --> 00:42:43
then destroyed.
There it is being made,

502
00:42:43 --> 00:42:48
being used for receptor binding and
for doing whatever it's going to do

503
00:42:48 --> 00:42:52
in the postsynaptic cell.
And here is an enzyme called

504
00:42:52 --> 00:42:56
acetylcholinesterase that cleaves
the acetylcholine and prevents it

505
00:42:56 --> 00:43:01
from being used again.
Acetylcholinesterase is essential to

506
00:43:01 --> 00:43:07
acetylcholine function.
Nerve gases, very typically,

507
00:43:07 --> 00:43:12
inhibit acetylcholinesterase.  That
is a very popular way that nerve

508
00:43:12 --> 00:43:18
gases work.  And when they do so,
what happens is that you have an

509
00:43:18 --> 00:43:24
excess of acetylcholine around and
you get occupation of the

510
00:43:24 --> 00:43:29
acetylcholine receptors on the
postsynaptic membrane that makes

511
00:43:29 --> 00:43:35
that postsynaptic cell fire
repeatedly or fire

512
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
without stopping.
And that will inhibit your ability

513
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
to breathe and not breathe and
breathe and not breathe.

514
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
And you will not be able to get
contraction and relaxation and

515
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
contraction and relaxation of the
muscles that allow you to breathe.

516
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
And nerve gases are generally toxic
for that reason.  They

517
00:43:56 --> 00:44:01
paralyze the muscles.
Our troops in Iraq and elsewhere

518
00:44:01 --> 00:44:05
have in their pockets atropine
syringes.  Syringes filled with a

519
00:44:05 --> 00:44:09
substance called atropine.
Atropine is a nerve gas antidote.

520
00:44:09 --> 00:44:13
And the way it works is in the
following way.

521
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
It acts by blocking.
It's a competitive inhibitor of the

522
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
acetylcholine receptor.
And so even in the presence of

523
00:44:21 --> 00:44:25
nerve gas, the acetylcholine that is
free and floating around in the

524
00:44:25 --> 00:44:29
synaptic cleft will not be able to
do its thing because atropine is

525
00:44:29 --> 00:44:32
preventing it from doing so.
Now, it's interesting.

526
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
I've told you acetylcholine does
many things through both ionotropic

527
00:44:36 --> 00:44:40
and metabotropic receptors.
And atropine will affect all of

528
00:44:40 --> 00:44:44
these things.  OK?
It will affect the ionotropic

529
00:44:44 --> 00:44:48
receptors particularly,
but what is has the side effect of

530
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
doing is making you very sleepy.
Nonetheless, it will save your life.

531
00:44:52 --> 00:44:56
OK.  Serotonin,
another neurotransmitter involved in

532
00:44:56 --> 00:45:00
mood.  It makes you feel
good about things.

533
00:45:00 --> 00:45:05
Here are two examples of ways that
serotonin activity is regulated.

534
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
Prozac is a class of molecules
called a specific serotonin reuptake

535
00:45:10 --> 00:45:15
inhibitor.  Serotonin,
when it is made, is released and

536
00:45:15 --> 00:45:20
then is retaken up into the vesicles
and used again.

537
00:45:20 --> 00:45:25
Prozac slows down this reuptake and
allows the serotonin to act for a

538
00:45:25 --> 00:45:30
more prolonged period than it
normally would have.

539
00:45:30 --> 00:45:34
And here is another one that you're
very familiar with,

540
00:45:34 --> 00:45:38
caffeine.  Caffeine is a competitive
inhibitor of the neurotransmitter

541
00:45:38 --> 00:45:42
adenosine.  Here is adenosine and
here is caffeine,

542
00:45:42 --> 00:45:47
and you can see that they both have
this purine ring.

543
00:45:47 --> 00:45:51
Caffeine will bind to the adenosine
receptor.  Adenosine normally

544
00:45:51 --> 00:45:55
promotes signal transduction
pathways that make you sleepy.

545
00:45:55 --> 00:46:00
And adenosine can be counteracted
by caffeine.

546
00:46:00 --> 00:46:04
You can go and look later at the
pathway that caffeine and adenosine

547
00:46:04 --> 00:46:09
both act upon.
And I will talk more about this

548
00:46:09 --> 00:46:12
next time.
