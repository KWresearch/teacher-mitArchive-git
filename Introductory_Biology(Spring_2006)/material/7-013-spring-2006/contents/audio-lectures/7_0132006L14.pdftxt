Transcript – Lecture 14 

OK.  So last time I reviewed for you some of the basic cloning techniques.  I 
failed to show you this slide, which I intended to do, which is a commercially 
available plasmid.  I told you about plasmids last time, small circular DNA 
molecules that are used in the purpose of cloning.  They’re derived from nature, 
but then they’ve been heavily manipulated by scientists to be useful for the 
purposes of cloning. 

Recall that they have two, three critical elements, an origin of replication to allow 
them to be replicated inside of bacteria, a selectable marker, a drug-resistance 
gene, ampicillin resistance gene for example, and finally, can you now show the 
middle slide?  He’s working on it.  And finally what we call a multiple cloning site, 
a set of restriction sites, restriction enzyme recognition sites that allow us to pop 
in pieces of DNA. 

I have dual paper readers.  Dual paper readers?  That doesn’t happen very often. 
You usually have one but not often two in a row.  Good.  So these are useful 
practical tools.  Maybe before I forget, I’ll mention, remind you of the quiz on 
Monday, where you go based on your last name.  There was a discussion last 
time about the review session, which is actually not on here but we didn’t change 
the review session.  Oh, because it was last night. 

We weren’t able to change the review session, which was last night, but there is 
a tutoring session which will cover the same material from today between 4:00 
and 6:00.  And then there are additional sessions with the TAs, including up till 
Monday morning before the exam.  So there should be ample opportunity to get 
your questions answered.  So plasmids are now sort of a useful and are a very 
available tool. 

This figure comes from your book.  It’s a version of what we covered in our 
example last time, the cloning of the T gene.  Here in red is the starting material, 
the DNA from the source.  In our case it was S. pyogenes, that flesh eating 
bacterium, but it could be anything.  It could be genomic DNA from you.  You 
take that genomic DNA, whatever the source material is, you digest it, cut it with 
a restriction enzyme, with a particular restriction enzyme. 

You then mix that DNA with plasmid DNA which has been cut with the same 
restriction enzyme, the sticky ends of the linear molecule anneal with the sticky 
ends of the plasmid.  You then add DNA ligase to seal those nicks to produce full 

covalently closed circular molecules that are composed of both the plasmid and 
now an insert from the DNA sample. 

You then take those recombinant plasmids, mix them with bacteria under 
conditions which allow the DNA to get into those bacterial cells.  This is a 
process called transformation.  You then plate those bacteria onto auger plates 
that contain the antibiotic, in this case ampicillin in our example.  The bacteria 
that didn’t get a plasmid die.  The bacteria that did get a plasmid survive and 
form colonies on the dish. 

And then the question I left you with was how are we going to find the colony or 
colonies that carry the T gene?  How are we going to find the gene, the 
recombinant plasmid, the colony carrying the recombinant plasmid with the T 
gene?  I also want to mention a bit of terminology, which we will come back to 
later.  We often refer to the collection of colonies, the collection of recombinant 
plasmids contained within those bacteria as a library. 

Like a library containing books, this is a collection of different things.  In this case, 
different recombinant plasmids which you can go back to repeatedly taking 
isolates from the colony.  In our case we would then grow up the individual 
bacteria to get ample amounts of the plasmid of interest.  And this term library is 
used in molecular biology a lot, a diverse collection of clone fragments to which 
you can return depending on your specific needs. 

So how are we going to isolate our plasmid of interest?  Well, if you recall, we 
knew the sequence of the genome of S. pyogenes.  And, therefore, we knew the 
sequence of the T gene.  So imagine that the T gene had a particular sequence 
starting from the 5 prime end of A-G-G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G-G-A to the 3 prime end. 

So this is imbedded within the T gene.  The reverse complement on the other 
strand reading in this direction from the 5 prime end would be T, did I say that, 
what’s this?  C-C-C-A-C-C-A-G-C-C-T 3 prime.  OK?  So we know a bit about the 
thing we’re interested in. 

We know its sequence.  And we can use this information to our advantage to 
isolate the plasmid that carries this fragment.  So the bacteria, as shown on this 
slide, are present in colonies.  Each colony contains a recombinant plasmid.  The 
first step in isolating the plasmid of interest is to make a copy of the plate that 
carries these bacteria to replicate what’s on this plate onto a piece of filter paper. 

We call this replica plating. 

And in this case we’re going to do it onto a filter, a piece of paper or nylon to 
make a copy of the colonies and the pattern of the colonies onto something else 

that we can manipulate.  So we make an exact copy.  And this done by literally 
placing the piece of filter paper onto the Petri dish, as shown here.  Here is the 
Petri dish with the colonies. 

You place a filter on top of those colonies.  They’ll stick to it.  Some of the cells in 
those colonies will stick to the filter.  You then pull the filter off and you get some 
of the colonies, some of the cells sticking in exactly the place where they were on 
the original plate.  You can actually place this on another plate and allow those 
cells to grow directly on the piece of filter paper.  So you make an exact copy of 
what was here onto a piece of paper.  Now, what are you going to do with that? 

Well, we’re going to use this information that we have about the sequence of the 
gene to isolate the colony of interest.  First thing we do is to lyse the bacteria that 
are now present on this filter and denature the DNA. 

What I mean by denature the DNA is to pull it apart.  It’s double-stranded when 
it’s present in the bacteria.  To denature DNA is to make it single-stranded. 

And typically the way we do that in these applications is to place a piece of filter 
paper under high pH conditions, and it causes the DNA strands to melt apart.  So 
now the plasmids, which were double-stranded in these bacterial cells, were 
double-stranded here have now been pulled apart into single-stranded 
molecules. 

So, on this piece of filter paper there are cells with unwound DNA, single-
stranded DNA in them in this same pattern, which I won’t try to reproduce here. 
And the question is how are we going to identify which colony carries a piece of 
the T gene?  How are we going to do that?  Does anybody have a clue?  All you 
need to know is present up here.  Yeah? 

So you’re thinking of the example from the book in which the, in the example in 
the book they used a plasmid that had two selectable markers.  And you were 
interested in those that grew under one antibiotic selection and didn’t grow under 
a different antibiotic selection.  In our case, in our plasmid, we actually didn’t 
have two selectable markers.  We only had one.  So we’re not going to use that 
strategy.  We have to rely on some of the information I’ve given you already. 

Well, we know the sequence of the T gene.  We know, for example, this little bit 
of the T gene, so we can make some that we call a probe.  A probe, for this 
application, is an oligonucleotide, a small segment of nucleotides that we can 
synthesize.  You can actually make any DNA sequence you want using chemical 
synthesis. 

This has now been fully automated.  So you can just punch the sequence into a 
computer, attach it to one of these machines, the machine will go off and make a 
linear piece of DNA of any sequence you want.  It’s like a typewriter almost.  You 
type it in, and what you get back out is a piece of DNA that is the sequence that 
you typed in.  So we can make any DNA we want such that we could make a 
piece of DNA that had the sequence A-G-G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G-G-A. 

OK?  We could make that piece of DNA.  Moreover, we could modify that piece 
of DNA with enzymes to add a radioactive phosphate at this 5 prime end.  So we 
could make a radio labeled probe.  So now that we have that, what are we going 
to do?  Anybody?  Yes.  Yes. 

Right. 

Exactly.  So this is now complementary to the other strand.  The DNA within 
these cells that have been lysed and now stuck onto this filter are also single-
stranded.  So this complementary strand is going to be sitting in a single 
stranded conformation ready to anneal, hybridize with this probe. 

So you apply this radioactive probe to this filter.  It will bind somewhat 
indiscriminately at first, but it will bind very tightly to that complementaryary 
strand from the T gene.  And remember there are probably a million bacterial 
cells within this colony, so there will be a million copies of the probe anneal to 
this colony.  You do have to do a little washing to get rid of the nonspecific 
binding which will take place.  So you wash the cells, or wash the filter, get rid of 
the nonspecific binding. 

The specific binding will withstand the wash.  And then you apply a piece of x-ray 
film.  And what you’ll end up with is a faint image of the filter, some very faint 
signal from the colonies that don’t hybridize, and a very strong signal from the 
colonies that did hybridize properly to the probe.  OK?  So now you know, based 
on the position on that filter, which colony it is that carries the T gene.  And in this 
case it’s that one right there. 

So we can go back to that master plate that we’ve kept, use a toothpick, pluck off 
that colony and grow it up into high concentrations successfully having 
completed our cloning project of the ever toxic T gene.  And that’s gone through 
here in this figure, if you want to look at it again.  You take this filter that has the 
colonies.  It’s actually the step here where you grow the cells up on the filter 
itself. 

You then lyse the cells, denature the DNA, add the radioactive probe.  It won’t 
hybridize strongly to those colonies that don’t carry the clone of interest.  It will 

hybridize strongly to the colonies that do have the clone of interest.  And then 
through this x-ray film method you can visualize where those colonies are and 
then go back and pick the colonies from the master plate.  OK?  So that’s how it 
works.  It’s fairly straightforward and works extremely well to give you the cells 
and clones of interest.  Woops. 

So that’s what we call clone identification by hybridization using a radioactive 
probe.  And I should mention, because it will come up again later, that we use 
these radioactive probes extensively for molecular biology. 

And we use non-radioactive probes, oligonucleotide synthesized in the same way 
that I mentioned for all sorts of molecular biology applications in this era.  And 
you’ll see examples later in the lecture.  I want to briefly mention another 
technique known as cloning by complementation.  In this instance, we’re going to 
clone by the function of the plasmid that we’ve introduced into the cells. 

Not its sequence.  By its function.  And the example I’m going to give you is to 
clone a gene that you might know about based on the biochemistry of the 
organism, but you haven’t identified the gene that encodes that enzyme.  The 
example I’m going to give you is to clone an enzyme which is responsible for 
catalyzing the breakdown of lactose, a disaccharide.  And this is accomplished 
by an enzyme called beta-galactosidase. 

And it converts glucose.  It converts lactose to glucose and galactose.  And this 
is an important enzyme in bacteria and also in you.  The enzyme is encoded by 
the lacZ gene of bacteria.  OK?  And this exercise that we’re going to go through 
is to try to isolate the lacZ gene through this method called cloning by 
complementation.  We need to use a trick, which I’ll show you on this slide. 

And that is that there’s an artificial substrate for this enzyme which is called in the 
field X-gal.  It’s related to lactose.  The important thing is that when X-gal gets 
cleaved by beta-galactosidase, it releases galactose and this molecule which 
precipitates and turns blue.  So we have a visual indicator of beta-galactosidase 
activity by placing in the medium, either in liquid medium or on a Petri dish, this 
substance X-gal. 

We know whether or not the cells have beta-galactosidase activity by virtue of 
whether the cells or the colonies turn blue.  OK.  So the first thing that we’re 
going to do in this technique is to take some wild type E. coli. 

If we take a liquid culture of wild type E. coli and we plate them onto a tissue 
culture, a Petri dish that contains X-gal, this substrate that in the presence of 
beta-galactosidase will turn blue, will get colonies.  And what color will those 
colonies be?  Blue. 

These are normal E. coli.  So they’re able to metabolize the X-gal and produce 
this blue pigment.  OK?  Now, I’m interested in the enzyme, the gene that 
encodes the enzyme that carries out this activity.  And the way that I’m going to 
get to it is first to isolate mutant E. coli.  It cannot do this reaction.  I’m going to try 
to isolate a mutant strain that’s deficient in beta-galactosidase activity. 

And the way that I do that is to mutagenize the wild type E. coli.  I can do this by 
physical methods or more commonly by just adding a chemical mutagen to the 
broth that the E. coli is growing in.  I mutagenize the cells and then I plate them 
onto a plate that has X-gal. 

Now, most of the cells that got mutagenized will have mutated some other gene, 
not the beta-galactosidase gene, some other gene, or maybe no gene, such that 
what color will those colonies be?  They’ll be blue because they still have a 
functional beta-galactosidase enzyme.  They still have a wild type lacZ gene.  So 
most of the colonies will be blue.  But what if the cell incurred a mutation in the 
lacZ gene that knocked out lacZ function? 

What color will the colony be?  Not blue.  It will be white.  OK?  And we’re going 
to assume, for the sake of argument, that if you get a white colony it means that 
the cells have a mutation in this gene lacZ.  That’s actually not a safe 
assumption.  It could have a mutation in some other gene, but we’re not going to 
worry about that today.  Just say that if we get a white colony we’re going to 
assume that the cells have a mutation in the lacZ gene. 

So now we want to clone the lacZ gene.  Our goal is to clone the lacZ gene. 
What are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  Well, I’ll give you the first 
clue.  We’re going to make a library. 

We’re going to make a library of fragments of DNA some of which will carry the 
lacZ gene.  From what are we going to make that library?  What will be our 
source DNA to make that library?  Will it be these cells isolated from this colony 
or will it be some other cell?  Do these cells have a functional lacZ gene? 

No.  Do these cells?  Yes.  So you want to make a library from wild type E. coli. 
So that you have a bunch of plasmids that carry fragments of the E. coli genome 
some of which carry the lacZ gene.  What am I going to do with that library? 
What am I going to do with that collection of clones? 

I’m going to transform it en masse all the different clones to a population of cells. 
What cells will I transform it into?  Which bacteria?  Would I put those ones into 
the lacZ mutants? 

And then I plate that transformation onto plates that contain amp.  I need the 
drug to identify those cells that have picked up any plasmid because I don’t care 
about cells that haven’t picked up any plasmid so I use amp plates.  And what 
else do the plates have in them? 

The indicator of lacZ activity, X-gal.  So I’m going to take these transformants, 
which were derived from these cells, and I’m going to plate them out onto a plate. 
What color will most of the colonies be? Will most of them, raise your hand.  Will 
most of them be white?  Will most of them be blue?  In fact, most of them will be 
white because most of the cells did not pick up a plasmid that carries the 
functional lacZ gene. 

Most of the cells picked up a plasmid that carried some other piece of the E. coli 
genome.  OK?  So most of the cells will not be, will not have functional lacZ 
activity, they’ll be white.  However, at some frequency a clone, a cell will pick up 
a recombinant plasmid that does carry the lacZ gene and that colony will turn 
blue. 

And that’s the colony that we’re now interested in because it has reconstituted 
lacZ activity.  The mutant, the recombinant DNA has complemented the 
mutation. 

So I could isolate this plasmid and sequence it.  And based on the sequence I 
might have confidence that indeed it is the lacZ gene.  Remember I told you that 
there was an assumption built in here that this mutation really did affect the lacZ 
gene?  And that’s why the cells were white. 

That was an assumption.  And to confirm that assumption we could look at the 
sequence of the clone that we isolated and figure it out, figure out whether it’s the 
right enzyme.  OK?  So I find that teaching this is always a little confusing.  I tried 
to simplify it today and go through it slowly.  Hopefully you took notes and you 
can think about it on your own.  It is relatively straightforward and it’s a useful 
concept to understand that A) you could isolate mutations, and B) you can find 
the genes that were mutated by complementing those mutations through cloning. 
OK? 

OK.  So now that I’ve spent a lecture and a half talking about cloning, I’m now 
going to tell you that cloning, while it was incredibly important and still is, has 
almost been superceded by another technique.  It’s not that we don’t use cloning. 
We actually use it all the time. 

But it’s been joined by another technique known as PCR which stands for the 
polymerase chain reaction. 

And any of you who have worked in molecular biology labs have been exposed 
to this because it is a totally pervasive technology.  Everybody uses it.  And it’s 
not just in molecular biology labs.  Forensic labs.  Archeology labs.  Anybody 
who’s interested in generating large amounts of DNA from a small amount of 
DNA uses this technique called PCR. 

It was invented only a few years ago, but it’s incredibly important.  In fact, the guy 
who invented it, who was not a very well known scientist, won the Nobel Prize 
just a couple of years after he invented it because it became so powerful so 
quickly.  It’s a very, very simple technique.  It’s one of these ah-ha techniques 
that after it’s been invented and described everybody says, oh, I could have 
thought of that.  But, actually, nobody did until this guy, Kary Mullis. 

So I’m going to show it to you briefly on the board.  And then we’re going to go 
through a movie that shows it again.  So hopefully you’ll get how it works. 
Importantly, it relies on having some information about the DNA that you want to 
amplify up in large quantities.  Again, the goal here is to amplify up a piece of 
DNA of interest to large quantities.  This technique is so powerful that you can 
use a single DNA molecule to start.  You can use the amount of DNA that you 
get from hair from a crime scene, for example.  And that’s mostly the way, you 
know. 

What is it?  CSI Miami and stuff.  They use this technique all the time.  So you 
can use minuscule amounts of DNA.  Even a single molecule is enough.  But you 
do need to know a little bit of known sequence. 

So if you know a little bit of known sequence you can use PCR.  So the first thing 
you do is to denature the DNA. 

And in this case we do that by heat.  If you heat up a DNA molecule it will also 
separate from itself.  And we typically heat it up to about 94 degrees.  And the 
consequence of this is this double-stranded piece of DNA molecule will separate 
into two single-stranded pieces of DNA.  And at that point we anneal, hybridize 
onto the DNA --

I’m not about to do another demonstration here.  We anneal onto the DNA 
oligonucleotides, synthetic little fragments of DNA that are complementary to this 
known sequence at this end and at this end.  So I synthesize a short 
oligonucleotide which will anneal to this strand at this position.  OK? 

I should have written up the polarities because people often get confused. 
Here’s the 5 prime end of this DNA molecule, the 3 prime end of that DNA 
molecule, the 3 prime end of that one, 5 prime end of that one.  So if I’m thinking 

about the top strand here, the 5 prime end here, the 3 prime end here, and that 
little oligonucleotide, which in this context we call a primer, would have its 5 
prime end here and its 3 prime end here.  Thus, the arrow because this is the 
direction of DNA synthesis. 

If we’re going to synthesize DNA off of this piece of DNA it’s going to go in that 
direction.  And then we likewise order up and anneal onto an oligonucleotide that 
binds to this strand of this sequence.  And, again, to show the polarities, here’s 
the 5 prime end.  Ah, thank you very much.  Here’s the 5 prime end, here’s the 3 
prime end, so that the oligonucleotide primer has its 5 prime end here, its 3 prime 
end here.  OK. 

And now these primers are sitting in such a way, annealed to a template piece of 
DNA with a 3 prime end facing in this direction, that are ready to be extended by 
DNA polymerase. 

Sorry.  I’m getting confused about my colors here.  You can’t see them on the 
board?  You can’t see the blue.  OK.  All right.  So the blue, sorry about this.  The 
blue will now be orange.  OK?  And this one will be pink.  OK?  So I’m going to 
extend this pink oligonucleotide with a polymerization reaction to fill in this strand. 

And I’m going to extend the orange guy likewise to fill in this strand.  OK?  So this 
is accomplished by addition of DNA polymerase and the nucleotide precursors 
that are needed for DNA synthesis, which we abbreviate dNTPs. 

And if I incubate that in that way I’ll get extension from this primer in this 
direction, extension from this primer in this direction.  And what I’ve done here is 
to go from one DNA molecule to two DNA molecules.  I’ve duplicated this piece 
of DNA in a test-tube.  The beauty of PCR is that you then go through this 
process again and again and again and again. 

And each time you get an exponential increase in the amount of DNA.  You go 
from one to two to four to eight and so on and so on and so on and so on.  And in 
a relatively short time you can now have millions, billions or more copies of your 
DNA.  OK?  So that’s the basic principle.  And, again, we’ll go through it in a little 
more detail in the movie.  As I said, the technique was invented by Kary Mullis, 
an investigator at a company called Cetus. 

Kary Mullis is an interesting character.  I don’t have time to tell you the full stories 
of Kary Mullis.  As I told you, he won the Nobel Prize.  He’s a real California kind 
of a surfer dude.  Very laid back. 

So, anyway, you can use this technique for lots of applications, as shown here. 
It’s been commercialized in many ways.  We now have machines that will go 
through these various stages of denaturation, annealing and synthesis using a 
temperature regulated block that will go from 94 degrees to 68 degrees to 72 
degrees to allow denaturation, annealing and polymerization around this circle 
many, many, many times. 

And if you do this, for example, 30 times, if you go through this cycle 30 times 
you make two to the thirtieth copies of your DNA, which is ten to the ninth DNA 
molecules, which is a ton.  And that can be done in just a couple of hours using a 
machine such as this.  OK.  So let me take you through this movie.  I’m going to 
cut it short because the process is gone through in great detail. 

The narrator is actually Paul Matsudaira who is a professor here at MIT.  And 
Paul really sort of drags it on, but I’m going to --

Basically all he says is what I said, which is you take an individual DNA molecule 
for which you know sequences, and you run through this reaction multiple times. 
And each time you do you get a duplication of the DNA sequence.  And your 
book goes through it, too.  So I will get this thing posted on the Web.  It’s not on 
Monday’s quiz so you don’t have to worry about that. 

We can learn about it in the future.  Maybe I’ll fix it so that on Monday’s lecture or 
Wednesday’s lecture, Professor Sive who is giving that lecture can go through it 
with you.  So sorry about this.  I also wanted to mention briefly that the enzyme 
that we use to carry out the polymerization, the particular DNA polymerase that 
we use is isolated from what we call a thermophilic bacterium isolated from the 
hot springs. 

And that’s important because we carry out this reaction at a very high 
temperature.  You’ll notice that the polymerization was done at 72 degrees. 
Now, your DNA polymerases won’t work at 72 degrees but this organism grows 
at very, very high temperatures so its DNA polymerase can function there.  And 
this, again, has turned into a cottage industry.  There are hundreds of millions of 
dollars worth of this particular polymerase called Taq polymerase sold for this 
application.  OK. 

So let’s carry onto the next topic then.  So what we’ve been talking about now is 
transferring DNA in the case of cloning or amplifying DNA for various 
applications.  For some applications that’s not good enough.  For certain 
therapeutic applications, for example, taking human genes and cloning them to 
make therapeutic proteins or to do gene therapy you cannot do standard cloning. 

And the reason is that human genes are usually way too big.  They have exons 
and introns, which you learned about, and they can be hundreds of thousands 

and sometimes millions of nucleotides in length.  And that’s way too big to fit into 
one of these plasmid cloning vectors and to efficiently introduce it to bacteria. 
And so for the purposes of generating clones from human genes we often use a 
technique called cDNA cloning. 

And I’ll take you through this briefly.  Recall that human DNA, human genes are 
broken up into coding elements that we call exons.  And we usually number 
these exons from left to right, one, two, three.  During the process of transcription 
a copy of this gene is made in the form of a precursor mRNA which has the same 
sequence. 

It has both the exons and the introns present.  And then before this is translated 
into protein the information in the introns has to be removed in a process called 
splicing. 

And that produces a mRNA which carries the exons lined up next to each other. 
So the introns are removed, the exons are joined, and it’s this mRNA that then 
gets translated into protein.  As I said, this can be very, very large.  But this is 
rather short.  And so if we want to make a copy of a gene we can also make a 
copy of its mRNA. 

And that might be more efficient and more useful.  And this is a technique called 
cDNA cloning.  It was made possible by an invention at MIT, a discovery at MIT 
of an enzyme that was not known to exist, an enzyme which violated the so-
called central dogma. 

The central dogma being that DNA is transcribed into RNA and that’s translated 
into protein.  David Baltimore discovered an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. 

Which can take the information in RNA and convert it to a DNA form.  And he 
actually won the Nobel Prize for that.  So this is the principle.  You can take an 
mRNA which has polarity 5 prime to 3 prime.  This mRNA that I produced up 
there, for example. 

You can anneal onto it an oligonucleotide primer.  This oligonucleotide primer is 
made of DNA.  It has a 5 prime end and a 3 prime end.  And then you add this 
enzyme reverse transcriptase, which I’ll abbreviate RT. 

Reverse transcriptase is unique in its ability to copy from an RNA template a 
DNA strand.  And so you’ll get a duplex which has RNA on the top and DNA on 
the bottom. 

You then get rid of the RNA. 

You hydrolyze the RNA. 

So all you’re left with is that single strand of DNA.  You now anneal on another 
primer, another oligonucleotide primer which now has a polarity 3 prime to 5 
prime in this direction because this one went 5 prime to 3 prime in this direction. 
And then you add DNA polymerase. 

Which will extend from this primer and make a full duplex of DNA where both 
strands are made out of DNA.  And this we call a cDNA clone, a copy of the 
mRNA.  cDNA clone.  And you can make libraries of cDNA clones from all the 
RNAs in your cells, for example. 

And then you can look, using various techniques, at different clones within that 
library for ones that function in different ways.  So I want to take you through a 
couple of examples of how we use cDNAs in the context of gene therapy.  This 
one comes out of your book.  This is an application where there’s an enzyme 
called TPA which will dissolve clots.  It’s called tissue plasminogen activator. 

And it’s used now to treat people who’ve had heart attacks or strokes.  So what 
was done was to make a cDNA copy of the TPA gene, introduce that into a 
plasmid vector with appropriate sequences in red and yellow to allow the 
expression of that gene in bacteria, transfer it into E. coli by transformation. 
Now, the E. coli will pump out this enzyme TPA. 

You can then purify that enzyme and inject it into this happy looking stroke 
patient to help dissolve the clots that it formed in the formation of the stroke. 
OK?  So that’s an example of genetic engineering one of our genes into bacteria 
to turn them into little protein factories from which you can purify the enzyme and 
hopefully mitigate the consequences of the disease. 

A second example, as opposed to putting in a therapeutic protein, you might 
want to put in a therapeutic gene.  So the example here I’ll give you is cystic 
fibrosis. 

I’ve mentioned to you in earlier lectures that cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease in 
which the individuals have a defect in a transporter, an ion transporter, so that in 
contrast to normal cells, here is a normal cell which has this CFTR transporter 
which will allow chloride ions to move in and out of the cell, as is a wild type 
individual. 

In the case of CF, that transporter is missing.  That leads to an inability of the 
cells to properly regulate their water content, and this leads to disease.  So what 
could you do about this disease? 

Well, why don’t you just put the defective gene back in?  We could make a cDNA 
copy of the cystic fibrosis gene, build it into a vector and introduce it not into 
bacteria but back into these cells.  So we could clone a CFTR cDNA back into 
these cells.  They would, in fact, pick up that DNA and begin to express it.  They 
would make this protein. 

And that would allow them to transport chloride properly.  And they might be 
ìnormalî.  This actually works extremely well in the tissue culture dish.  It doesn’t 
work nearly so well in the context of a human being.  Even though we can make 
viral versions of this, viruses that carry cDNAs, recombinant viruses, and I’ll draw 
that up here. 

Using the same methods of recombinant DNA technology, I can make a 
recombinant virus, like a cold virus that now carries a piece of this cDNA for 
CFTR, and I could use that to infect a person who has CF. 

That’s a person and they have CF so they’re not happy.  I could introduce into 
their nasal passage, they could breath in this virus that carries the gene.  And if 
the gene, if the virus infected the cells of the lung, remember the problem occurs 
in the lung, maybe, if this were very efficient, the person would be happy, we 
could cure them. 

The problem is that this introduction of the virus is very inefficient in vivo, in the 
person.  It doesn’t work very well.  You cannot get enough virus in to infect 
enough cells to correct the disease in the person.  So although gene therapy is 
very attractive for many diseases such as CF, it actually hasn’t worked very well. 
But there is one example of a cure using gene therapy.  And I want to just end by 
telling you that story. 

To cure the disease you probably heard about, the disease that causes ìthe boy 
in the bubbleî syndrome, which is severe combined immunodeficiency, or at least 
one form of it, these individuals have a defect in an enzyme called ADA, 
adenosine deaminase.  And this results in a very severe immunodeficiency. 
They don’t have their immune cells.  They cannot fight infection.  So the kids 
have to stay inside protective chambers to avoid exposure to pathogens, the 
bubble.  For a long time they really weren’t well treated. 

They could be treated with having a little bit of the enzyme.  I guess that’s not 
shown here but on the next slide.  If you add the enzyme back, even to their 
blood, you can get some protection.  But, nevertheless, the kids did not do 

terribly well and often died from infections.  Here’s the disease mechanism.  It’s 
caused by a defective enzyme that normally breaks down adenosine.  This leads 
to a buildup of a precursor, or rather a metabolite that kill cells of the immune 
system, and the individuals have immunocompromised state. 

If you can just hang on for one or two more minutes.  So what’s done here, in 
contrast to the failed example for CF where I said that it’s very difficult to get the 
virus into the cells in the person, what’s done in the case of this disease is to take 
the cells out of the person.  And this is called ex vivo gene therapy where you 
isolate cells from the bone marrow of one of these kids, the stem cells that give 
rise to the cells of the blood system, and then you infect those cells in vitro with 
the virus that carries the cDNA of the ADA gene. 

You isolate those cells that have that gene and then you introduce the cells back 
into the person.  And you can control that process much more carefully, much 
more efficiently, and you have a much greater concentration of cells that are 
doing the right thing now.  This goes through it in some more detail.  It’s a version 
of a slide from your book so you can look at it. 

It’s gene therapy.  And I want to point out that although it can work, and it does 
work, it has one risk, namely that the virus that carries the therapeutic gene 
actually integrates into the DNA of the cells.  And if it integrates into a gene that’s 
important that integration could actually cause a mutation.  So there’s a risk 
associated with gene therapy. 

And, in fact, although this was successful, as you can see here, two kids with 
SCID, or actually a number of kids with SCID were cured through this ex vivo 
gene therapy approach, and now they can run around like everyday kids, 
unfortunately, in this first study of 11 patients, all of whom were ìcuredî, later two 
of the kids ended up getting leukemia.  And they did because the virus had 
inserted itself, the genome of the virus had inserted itself next to a gene that 
when it becomes too active it causes the cells of the immune system to 
proliferate abnormally leading to leukemia. 

So although there was a benefit there was also a risk.  In this case, families of 
these kids actually are willing to take that risk because it’s such an awful disease. 
But you have to be aware that in all of these kinds of therapies there’s a risk-
benefit analysis that has to go on.
