7.013 Introductory Biology, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 28 

So up until this point in the class you've learned basics about cell molecular 
biology, genetics and development, how things normally work, how cells normally 
function, how tissues are formed, how organisms are formed and function. 

And hopefully you've had an ample founding in understanding normal biology. 
We're going to take a turn today and for the next three lectures talk about 
abnormalities that lead to disease.  And, whereas, I have tried to keep things light 
for you in my lectures and try to be entertaining if possible, the subject of the next 
three lectures is not a light one. 

It's a very serious one.  And it is cancer.  It is a disease that I know a great deal 
about and have worked on in my lab for the last 17 years.  It's a very important 
and very devastating disease.  And we're going to try to give you an introduction 
to it. 

And you'll see that many of the things that you've learned over the course of this 
class, up until this point, really prepare you to understand the details of cancer, 
cancer development, and hopefully also cancer treatment.  And I'll say right up 
front that I'm actually quite optimistic that the progress that we've made over the 
last several years in understanding the molecular basis of cancer has put us into 
position to treat the disease differently than we've done in the past and more 
effectively. 

The number of drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of cancer today that are directed and in this more 
effective class is not great, but there are some.  And that number will increase. 
So I think there's reason for optimism utilizing the information, the kinds of 
information, the strategies that we'll cover in the next three lectures.  So cancer, I 
think in some respects, needs no introduction. 

It's a disease that probably has affected some of you already in your lives 
personally.  Certainly everybody knows a family member or friend who has 
developed the disease.  It is a remarkably common disease.  In this country 
alone --

-- more than a million people are diagnosed every year with cancer. 

And this does not include another million who are diagnosed with the less serious 
forms of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.  So, in 

that respect, more than two million people get the diagnosis of cancer every year 
in this country.  Moreover, each year --

-- more than half a million people die in this country from cancer.  That's more 
than 1,500 people per day.  So in two days more people die of cancer than died 
in the World Trade Center disaster.  It's a devastating disease. 

Half of the men in this room and a third of the females --

-- will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes.  And overall more than a 
quarter of all deaths are attributable to cancer. 

A major problem.  A major burden.  Clearly something we need to do something 
about.  So I'm going to show you some slides that introduce you to the disease. 
Cancer, as you know, is a generic term that covers a class of diseases that affect 
many, actually, almost all of your organs.  You can get cancers in different 
places. 

They're all defined by one common property which is too many cells.  Too many 
cells in a tissue causing a lump.  Too many cells in the blood.  Too many cells in 
lymph organs.  So that's the common theme that relates to all cancers, but there 
are very important differences in cancers in different sites.  This is a radiographic 
image of lung cancer. 

What you're looking at here is a standard chest x-ray.  And this individual, you 
can see, has an opacity right here, a fairly large opacity that's probably about the 
size of your fist in this lobe of the lung.  And that's fairly advanced lung cancer. 
This is a more precise diagnostic test called computed tomography, which is 
essentially a series of x-ray slices that get reconstructed.  It gives better 
resolution.  And you can see, again, a very large mass in the lung of this 
individual. 

So that's a solid tumor imaged by radiography.  This is leukemia.  Leukemia is 
also too many cells but here it's in the blood.  This is a normal blood smear. 
These pale cells without nuclei are your red blood cells.  These nucleated cells 
are white blood cells of different types.  And you can see in this abnormal blood 
smear of a leukemia patient there is a vast increase in the number of white blood 
cells.  So this is a diagnostic feature of leukemia, too many cells. 

And it's diagnosed by looking at blood counts.  And the blood counts in leukemia 
patients of white cell counts can be elevated by thousands, if not hundreds of 
thousands of fold.  You can also use other imaging techniques to detect and 
diagnose cancer.  This is endoscopic examination, colonoscopy. 

It's now recommended that everyone undergoes this exam every year when they 
reach age 50 to detect tumors at an early stage so that they can be removed 

surgically which is, in fact, the most effective treatment for colon cancer.  And, 
actually, for almost all cancers.  The most effective treatment for cancer is the 
removal of the tumor.  If you can get to the tumor at an early stage through some 
of these imaging techniques and eradicate it, remove it, you can greatly limit the 
mortality associated with the disease.  So this is endoscopy. 

This is what a normal colon looks like, sort of a smooth structure.  This is an early 
stage colon tumor.  It's called a polyp at this stage.  And I'll give you a little bit 
more nomenclature in a minute.  This is actually not cancer.  A polyp is not 
cancer.  It's a benign tumor.  This may or may not progress to a cancer, but if the 
doctor were to find a polyp like that they might follow it for one or two years.  But 
if were to get bigger they would remove it.  And they can actually do it 
endoscopically. 

They can remove it using a surgical endoscope.  They don't actually have to do 
surgery to remove polyps anymore.  At some frequency these polyps do 
progress to colon cancer.  And this is a true cancer, a carcinoma which has 
changed its shape and importantly changed its relationship to the tissue. 
Whereas, the polyp is sort of sitting up on top of the tissue, having grown out of 
the tissue, the colon cancer has invaded into the tissue.  It has become much 
more destructive in that sense. 

And also, importantly, has the capacity to move outside of the colon through that 
process of invasion to other parts of the body, and thereby cause problems 
elsewhere.  Usually, when these are diagnosed by endoscopy or other methods, 
they are removed.  This is done by surgery where a portion of the colon is 
actually removed and then the two resected ends joined. 

And you can see the colon cancer right here.  If the cancer is detected at an early 
enough stage, surgery is curative for colon cancer.  Unfortunately, it's often too 
late when it's diagnosed.  It looks like that.  Because it's already moved outside 
of the colon and tumor cells have found their way to other parts of the body.  So 
surgical removal of the primary tumor, while helpful, may actually not be curative. 
So I want to go through in diagrammatic form some of the points that I've just 
made. 

Cancer develops in states.  It doesn't happen all at once.  As I showed you in the 
normal colon polyp to colon cancer series, things happen in stages.  It's actually 
best worked out in the colon.  But we believe the same phenomena hold true for 
other cancers in other places.  It doesn't happen all at once.  It happens in 
stages.  And these slides illustrate the basic principles of that.  This illustrates a 
normal tissue.  It could be anywhere, but let's say that it's in the colon. 

And there are certain important features to pay attention to.  One is that the cells 
have regular shape and a regular relationship to their neighbors.  As you know, 
tissues are formed for normal function.  They have particular genes expressed. 

They have particular structures inside them.  They interact with their neighbors in 
order to perform their function.  So the cells of the colonic epithelium line up like 
this touching each other, interacting with each other and interacting with the cells 
underneath them, as well as other material underneath them. 

Here is a material called the basement membrane, otherwise known as the 
extracellular matrix.  And this helps support the cells and provides the cells with 
certain nutrients and growth factors.  There are also cells below these cells in the 
colon and in other tissues which replenish these cells when they get lost.  These 
stem or progenitor cells exist probably in all adult tissues.  They get recruited 
when cells turnover. 

And we now think, and it's not illustrated on these slides, but we now think that 
these cells are probably very important in tumor initiation.  We think that these 
are cells, these stem cells of the tissue are likely to be the place where the 
tumors initiate and then produce cells, like this brown cell here, which is already 
abnormal.  Cells that have acquired a mutation which makes them different from 
their neighbors.  Now, the first consequence of those early changes is that you 
get too many cells.  And this is a process known as hyperplasia. 

Hyperplasia simply means hyper, too many, plasia, division, cell division.  So 
there are too many cells.  But the cells that are present there look pretty normal. 
They don't histologically, by looking at the tissue, appear different from their 
normal neighbors.  There are just too many of them.  This process continues until 
you can actually see a discernable lump, a mass, and that is a formation of a 
benign tumor. 

In the colon that tumor, that benign tumor is called an adenoma.  It's called other 
things in other places but let's say, just for the sake of simplicity, it's a benign 
tumor.  And, again, this is an increase in the number of cells but the cells 
themselves don't look very different from their normal neighbors.  And these 
tumors are not life-threatening yet.  They sometimes will never be life-threatening 
but in this form they rarely cause problems.  They're just a lump.  Like a wart is a 
benign tumor, a lump that doesn't cause problems. 

At some frequency these tumors can progress further.  And now, as you can see 
from this different shading, the cells take on different characteristics.  They look 
different from their normal neighbors.  Their cyto architecture, the cell shape 
looks different.  The nucleus often looks different from the normal cells.  And so 
they've become fundamentally changed in their appearance.  Moreover, they 
have begun to recruit a blood supply.  The presence of these blood vessels 
which were not present up here is another indication that things have 
progressed. 

And tumors require a blood supply of their own to feed the tissue, this abnormal 
growing tissue.  As soon as they get to a certain size they need to recruit a new 

blood supply.  This tumor at this stage has changed enough that we now call it 
cancer.  This is based on these histological changes, the appearance of the cells, 
as well as the cells' relationship to one another. 

And this is now considered dangerous.  If you're diagnosed with a cancer, even if 
it's present in the tissue, the initial tissue alone, it would be recommended for 
removal.  However, it rarely stays there.  Tumors have the capacity to move from 
their original site through a process of invasion and then metastasis.  This 
illustrates invasion, local invasion where the tumor cells are moving from the 
mass through the basement membrane and ultimately accessing the blood 
supply. 

Literally moving into blood vessels, traveling through the blood, and then moving 
out of blood vessels and beginning to proliferate, expand in other tissues.  And 
this is the process of metastasis.  And the tumor cells can literally go anywhere. 
Certain tumors have preferences to go to certain tissues than others.  And when 
they get there they begin to grow again and turn, become actually more 
advanced, more dangerous, cause local tissue damage, organ failure. 

And it's usually this that causes the death of the cancer patient.  It's the 
metastatic spread of the disease as opposed to the primary tumor that tends to 
kill cancer patients.  And sadly it's this phase of the disease, metastatic spread 
that we know the littlest about.  We actually know rather little about what allows 
cells to move from their primary site through the blood, establish themselves 
elsewhere and then grow there. 

And since it is the most deadly phase of the disease, it represents a clear need, 
clear opportunity to learn more.  So let me just illustrate, or rather emphasize 
some of these bits of terminology for you. 

Hyperplasia is simply too many cells.  You have hyperplastic lesions, we call 
them, throughout your body.  Most of them no problem at all.  They're not going 
to do anything.  It's just there are too few many cells in that particular place. 
These can progress to benign tumors which are non-aggressive. 

That is the cells are relatively well-behaved.  They're not dividing that much. 
They're not moving around.  They have normal relationships with their neighbors. 
And with respect to the tissue that they reside in, they're nondestructive.  They 
haven't breached the underlying basement membrane.  They haven't changed 
their relationship with their normal neighbors.  And they're also defined through a 
lack of spread.  They haven't moved out into the local lymph nodes or to 
surrounding tissues. 

These can progress to malignant tumors.  And these are true cancers.  We 
actually only use the term cancer to refer to malignant tumors, not to benign 
tumors.  These are true cancers.  And these are aggressive.  The cells have 

changed shape.  They have much greater proliferative capacity.  They move 
around to a greater degree. 

They are destructive with respect to the tissue in which they reside.  And they 
have the potential to spread.  Not all diagnosed cancers have already spread, but 
the view of the pathologist is that they have the potential to spread and therefore 
they are typically removed.  Now cancers in different places have different 
names.  As I said, you can get cancer in virtually all tissues of your body. 

There are probably 250 or 300 different types of cancer clinically defined, and 
those are defined in part based on where they are and in what types of cells they 
occur.  So there are tumors of epithelial cells, cells of the skin, lining of the 
intestine, mammary epithelial cells, epithelial cells of your brain. 

And these tumors are called carcinomas.  These cancers are called carcinomas. 
And you might have heard, for example, a subset of carcinomas called 
adenocarcinomas.  Adenocarcinoma is what I showed you with respect to the 
colon cancers.  Adenocarcinoma of the breast.  Adenocarcinoma of the lung. 
These are carcinomas that have a glandular appearance.  And there are other 
kinds of carcinomas as well. 

Those are the cancers.  And the benign tumors of these tissues, especially of the 
class that gives rise to adenocarcinomas are called adenomas.  There are also 
tumors of your connective tissues like you cartilage or your muscles or your 
tendons. 

These are called sarcomas.  And you've probably heard of myosarcomas.  Those 
are tumors of the muscle.  And there are different types of myosarcomas.  And 
then there are tumors of the blood system. 

These are called leukemias if the tumors are present, tumor cells are present 
within the blood itself.  And I showed you an example of that.  Or lymphomas. 
And here it's defined as tumors which stay within lymph organs like lymph nodes 
or spleen or thymus.  They haven't made their way out into the blood, but they 
are still tumors of the blood cells. 

OK.  So we know a lot about what these tumors look like based on visual 
inspection.  We also know what they look like based on histological analysis. 
This is a progression series actually taken from a mouse model of cancer 
generated in my lab.  It's a tumor of the lung.  You might be able to see the lacey 
appearance of the lung here.  And this circle you can see hyperplasia, too many 
cells. 

Cells, if you were to see them up close, look pretty much like their neighbors, but 
there are just too many of them.  These progress into lumps, masses called 
adenomas in this case.  These are benign tumors.  They don't have the features 

of the more aggressive malignant cells.  And you can see them here.  They all 
look pretty much the same.  And if you saw them next to a normal cell they would 
look pretty much like those. 

But these can progress into adenocarcinomas, more advanced tumors.  These 
are true cancers.  And you can tell that based on the fact that the nuclei, if you 
compare one cell to another, looks very different, and the cell shape looks very 
different from one to the other.  So there's heterogeneity.  And what you cannot 
see here is that the tumors are also much more proliferative.  They are dividing. 
The cells are dividing much more frequently.  So, again, histologically we can 
characterize what these tumors look like. 

What I'm going to tell you about from this point really to the end of the class is 
that we understand, at least to a degree, what these arrows represent, what 
happens to a normal cell on the way to hyperplasia or to an adenoma or to an 
adenocarcinoma.  And the answer is defects to genes.  Defects to many genes 
underlie these transitions, allow a normal cell to develop into a cancer cell. 

And so in that sense we consider cancer as a genetic disease.  Now, cancer 
actually is also a more traditional genetic disease in some instances.  There are 
people who are genetically predisposed to developing cancer.  And I'm actually 
going to tell you about them next time. 

But even for people who are not genetically predisposed to cancer, the 
development of cancer in them is a genetic disease.  How do we know that? 
Why do we think that?  Well, we think that for a number of reasons.  And one of 
them, which we've appreciated for more than a hundred years is that the 
chromosomes of cancer cells are screwed up.  They look different than normal 
cells.  I've actually shown you this slide before. 

This is a karyotype of a normal cell, 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs.  These are 
highlighted by stains that allow us to distinguish one chromosome from another. 
So chromosome one stains yellow, chromosome two stains red, and so on and 
so forth.  And this is the karyotype of a cancer cell.  It's different in many ways. 
Name me two. 

I didn't hear anybody.  I heard there was mumbling but I didn't hear anybody. 
Say again. 

The number and shape of chromosomes.  Good.  So clearly there are too many 
chromosomes.  I didn't count them up, but there is more than double the proper 
number of chromosomes in this cancer cell.  So chromosome number defects 
are quite common in cancer cells.  But also structure, and I've boxed two of them 
here, the structure of chromosomes in cancer cells are different.  This 
chromosome has undergone what we call a translocation in which a piece of one 
chromosome has been joined to a piece of a different chromosome. 

And we now know that when that happens it's reflective of a mutation that either 
is inactivating or activating a gene that's present at the point of translocation. 
And this chromosome has undergone a truncation, a deletion.  Genetic material 
has been loss.  And this, again, indicates that there was a gene present there 
that the tumor cell wanted to get rid of in the development of the cancer.  So 
chromosomal abnormalities are quite common, which was a first clue that cancer 
is a genetic disease. 

The second indication, which came along as early as the 1920s, is that many 
carcinogens, and what I mean by that is agents that cause cancer. 

Many carcinogens are mutagens, agents that cause what?  Yeah? 

Not all.  But there is a very high correlation between things that will cause cancer 
and things that will cause mutation in simple mutation assays. 

And you can do assays to determine the carcinogenicity or mutagenicity of an 
agent of interest. 

Carcinogenicity assays are done typically in experimental animals, mice or rats. 
And one takes the animal and exposes it to agent X.  It might be injected into the 
animal or it might be painted on the skin of the animal.  And then one waits a 
period of time and asks the question did the animal develop a tumor? 

And if so the agent is a carcinogen.  And you can actually determine how strong 
a carcinogen is, how strong a carcinogen it is by determine the dose, the amount 
of the agent needed to produce a tumor.  There are also mutagenicity tests. 

And this is typically done in bacteria.  So one takes a bacterial strain and asks 
whether the agent can cause mutations in that strain.  And usually to do this one 
takes a bacterial strain that already has a mutation, a bacteria that is histidine 
deficient, which means that it's not able to synthesize its own histidine and amino 
acid. 

That means that if you take that bacteria strain and plate it onto a Petri dish that 
lacks histidine, you haven't added histidine to the media, will it grow?  No.  It's 
histidine minus, it cannot make its own, if you don't provide it, cells cannot grow, 
so you get no colonies. 

However, if I now add agent X, which I think might be a mutagen, to these 
bacteria, if it is a mutagen it might mutate the defective histidine gene and turn it 
into a normally functioning histidine gene such that if I now plate these bacteria 
that have been treated with the mutagen I may get some colonies.  And you're 
still using a his-minus plate here. 

And the number of colonies that I get is an indication of the strength of the 
mutagen.  Lots of colonies, strong mutagen.  Fewer, not so strong.  And what I'm 
saying is that there's a strong correlation between things that pass this assay and 
things that pass that assay, another indication that cancer might be caused by 
mutations to DNA.  Now some things that we know for sure are carcinogens. 
They pass this carcinogenicity test very, very strongly. 

Fail in this simple mutagenicity test.  Why?  How can that be?  They clearly are 
cancer-causing.  But if you mix them with bacteria in isolation here you don't get 
any increased mutation frequency.  What's different?  What's different about this 
situation versus this situation?  Yes? 

Excellent.  Precisely correct.  There are certain agents which in their native form 
are not mutagenic.  We call them promutagens.  However, when acted on by the 
body in the process of metabolism they become mutagens. 

The body senses that these are actually dangerous compounds and will try to 
detoxify them, typically by adding hydroxyl groups to them to make them more 
water-soluble so that they can be secreted or excreted by the body.  But in the 
process of making them more water-soluble they go through an intermediate 
form which turns out to be highly mutagenic. 

And that's illustrated here for a very powerful carcinogen known as 
benzo(a)pyrene.  This is an agent found in cigarette smoke, for example.  This 
agent is not highly mutagenic on its own, but in this type of test it is highly 
carcinogenic.  And what happens is that the body, in an attempt to add hydroxyl 
groups to make it more water-soluble, will actually introduce epoxides in different 
ring positions of this molecule, as an intermediate towards making it more 
hydroxylated. 

And these epoxides are very interactive with DNA and therefore mutagenic.  So 
the body turns something that actually wasn't mutagenic into something that is 
mutagenic.  And therefore this test, this mutagenicity test has been modified, 
principally based on the work of a bacteriologist at Berkeley named Bruce Ames. 

And so we now call it the Ames Test.  And the Ames Test takes the compound, 
the agent that you're trying to test the mutagenicity of, and rather than adding it 
directly back to bacteria it's mixed first with an extract of the liver.  Many of the 
enzymes that do this detoxification are present in your liver.  Cytochrome P450 
enzymes, for example. 

In which case the compound becomes modified, or might become modified.  And 
through that modification becomes mutagenic.  And then the agent gets tested in 
the standard bacterial mutagenicity test. 

OK.  So we can now expand our list of things that are mutagenic through 
exposing them to some of the body's own enzymes. 

In this sense, the body is actually doing you a disservice in thinking it's actually 
trying to help you.  There are still other agents which are not mutagens, even in 
the Ames Test, but are clearly carcinogens.  Asbestos, for example.  That stuff in 
packing material that's now been banned exposure to which gives people, or can 
give people mesotheliomia, a tumor of the lining of the lungs. 

It's not a mutagen.  However, you test it, it's not a mutagen.  Alcohol, which is 
clearly associated with liver cancer, is not a mutagen.  These agents we think act 
as irritants.  They case damage to tissue which causes the cells to have to 
increase their proliferation to repair the tissue, and that is inherently a mutagenic 
process.  And so these things can act as carcinogens in that very indirect way. 

OK.  Now there are many things in our environment that are carcinogens --

-- that we get exposed to either passively or deliberately.  Sunlight, for example, 
is a carcinogen and a mutagen.  It causes damage to DNA, causes mutation, 
increases your risk of skin cancer. 

Other things that we do to ourselves.  Certain dietary carcinogens we impose on 
ourselves.  But what's the biggest carcinogen that we impose on ourselves? 
Smoke.  Tobacco smoke. 

And obviously tobacco smoke is associated with one particular type of cancer, 
although it's not limited to lung cancer. 

Any idea how many people die of lung cancer in this country per year?  Anybody 
want to hazard a guess?  10,000?  100,000?  175,000.  175,000 people per year 
die of lung cancer each year.  And more than 150,000 of them it's because of 
smoking. 

Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer.  It kills more people in this country 
than breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer combined.  And it's 
completely preventable, or almost completely preventable through a change of 
habit, failure to smoke.  So let me just emphasize the importance of this. 

These are curves that show the smoking frequency in this country among men 
and women and the incidence of cancer, lung cancer in this country among men 
and women.  You can see that early on, in the early part of the century smoking 
was  uncommon and lung cancer was uncommon.  But as people began to 
smoke this frequency increased and then years later the incidence of lung cancer 
increased dramatically.  It takes a little while. 

You've got to expose yourself to these carcinogens for a period of time for this 
process to have its effect, but eventually that smoking exposure leads to the 
development of lung cancer.  You can see that women started smoking a little bit 
later, but they quickly caught up.  And now the lung cancer incidence in women is 
also extremely high.  Lung cancer among women is the leading cause of cancer 
deaths.  It's now surpassed breast cancer as the leading cancer killer of women. 

The statistics about smoking in this country, despite these facts, are remarkable. 
47 million adults smoke.  Roughly one in four men, and almost as many women 
smoke. 

Even more amazing to me than that, in 2002, I don't have more recent statistics 
than that, but in 2002 the percent of high school students who responded to a 
survey about whether they smoked was what? 

What do you think?  High school students.  28%.  So this is not just people who 
have been smoking a long time, who started when they didn't know any better. 
Kids who get exposed to the message about smoking and lung cancer from an 
early age are not paying attention.  So the problem is not going away.  These 
folks obviously have a dramatically increased risk of dying from lung cancer. 

And it's not just lung cancer.  Smoking increases your risk of heart disease, of 
stroke, of emphysema.  I read a startling statistic when I was preparing this.  Of 
all the people who are alive today on this planet, 500 million of them will die early 
due to tobacco usage. 

500 million people who are alive today would live longer if not for exposure to 
tobacco products.  So if you learn nothing else from this class this year, if you 
now smoke, stop.  If you don't smoke, don't start.  OK.  So carcinogens in our 
environment and carcinogens that we exposure ourselves to are important.  No 
doubt about it, they can be a cause of cancer. 

I call these exogenous or environmental mutagens.  And, as I mentioned, 
sunlight and other forms of radiation, certain dietary things that we expose 
ourselves to fall into this category. 

But they're not the only thing that causes cancer.  And it's very important that you 
know that.  In fact, more of the mutations that happen in cancer are due to 
indigenous processes, things that happen inside your bodies regardless of what 
you get exposed to, like DNA replication mistakes.  DNA polymerases that 
duplicate your DNA are pretty good, they have proofreading functions, but they 
still make mistakes. 

And these mistakes can be then in critical genes which can ultimately lead to 
tumor development. 

Your DNA can sometimes get broken.  It gets moved around inside the cell 
during various processes.  Sometimes it gets broken, and sometimes those 
breaks are not properly repaired.  And this can lead to some of the defects that 
I've shown you on this slide like the translocations where different pieces get 
rearranged with the wrong other piece. 

Defects in chromosome segregation.  We talked about mitosis early in the class 
and how the cells have an intricate ability to properly segregate their 
chromosomes, that each daughter cell gets the right number.  Sometimes that 
process doesn't work properly so that one cell gets too many chromosomes or 
one cell gets too few.  These chromosomal imbalances can also contribute to 
tumor development. 

Defects in DNA repair. 

Your cells have all sorts of enzymes that will try to find damaged DNA and fix it, 
but these enzymes themselves can be mutationally inactivated in the 
development of cancer.  So now you've debilitated the cell's ability to fix the 
damage leading to an increased frequency of damage, increased frequency of 
mutation, increased cancer risk. 

And importantly --

-- production of indigenous mutagens in contrast to exogenous mutagens.  Your 
body actually produces things that are mutagenic. 

And the biggest class of these are oxygen radicals such as superoxide --

-- or hydrogen peroxide. 

And these radicals are highly reactive to DNA, can cause DNA breaks and base 
changes, and cause mutation.  And your body produces these naturally in the 
process of metabolism.  You have enzymes that will kind of keep the 
concentrations of these down but, nevertheless, they're present and cause 
damage at a certain frequency in all cells.  If that damage occurs in the wrong 
cell at the wrong time it can be cancer-causing.  So there are lots of ways that 
the DNA of your cells can get mutated, which then overall contributes to the 
development of cancer. 

Now, this doesn't happen all at once, as I've tried to indicate to you.  It doesn't 
happen from normal cell to cancer cell in a single step.  We think that this 
process happens over time.  And in humans over decades of time.  Cancers 
often initiate maybe in mid-life, but they don't present themselves as a clinically 
advanced tumor until late in life.  and that's because the process requires lots of 
steps that require lots of time to accumulate. 

And so we now consider tumor development from a normal cell to a more 
advanced cancer cell as a clonal evolution process.  A clonal evolution process 
whereby abnormal cells arise in a population.  These now have a selected 
advantage compared to their normal cells and will grow, for example, better than 
their normal cells, divide faster than their normal cells, make more of themselves. 

The mutation that took place is now present in all the daughter cells of that 
abnormal cell.  And within that now-expanded clone of abnormal cells a second 
mutation takes place which increases the capacity of that cell to grow and divide, 
survive, move around compared to its neighbors.  So now this cell and of its 
descendents have two mutations.  And within that expanded clone a third 
mutation can take place and so and so forth. 

We now think that cancers, advanced cancers in human probably have five, ten, 
maybe twenty distinct mutations in genes controlling important processes.  What 
are those processes?  There are many.  We're going to emphasis, in this class, 
just proliferation and cell death.  I'll say a bit more about that in a second.  But it's 
also important for you to know that the cancer cells also regulate factors that 
increase the blood supply. 

Cancer cells turn on growth factors that recruit blood vessels.  If they didn't do so 
they would never be able to progress.  You cannot actually make a solid tumor 
bigger than two millimeters in diameter without recruiting a new blood supply. 
And so the tumor cells turn on these factors to deal with angiogenesis.  They also 
turn on factors that allow them to move around to a greater degree or separate 
themselves from their neighbors to invade into the basement tissues, the 
basement membranes. 

To turn on proteases, for example, that chew up the extracellular matrix to allow 
the cells to move around, and other factors.  Factors, for example, that allow 
them to move into the blood vessels or move back out of the blood vessels in the 
process of metastasis.  So we're going to emphasis proliferation and cell death in 
the next lecture, but I want you to know that many other aspects of cell biology 
are important in this process as well. 

So proliferation, it's kind of obvious that in cancers there might be changes that 
lead to more cell division.  And, indeed, the original cancer-associated genes did 
this.  And many of the important cancer-associated genes that we know about 
are involved in promoting increased cell division. 

But we also know that cell death or apoptosis, which I briefly introduced you to in 
an earlier lecture, is important in tumor development.  And do you find more 
apoptosis or less apoptosis during tumor development?  Less.  There's 
decreased amounts of cell death in tumor cells compared to normal cells. 

And this is due to mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis, positive mutations 
that block apoptosis, loss of function mutations in genes that are normally 
required for apoptosis.  And we think, therefore, that the balance, if you think of 
this as a scale where proliferation is on one end and cell death is on the other. 

Whereas, this process is well balanced in normal tissues, what we call normal 
homeostasis, you produce as many cells as you need, you kill off as many cells 
as you need in order to give rise to a normal, average cell number.  In cancer this 
process is deranged.  And this can happen in one of two ways, and typically in 
both. 

There can be an increase in proliferation and a reduction in cell death.  And we'll 
talk about some of the factors that control those specifically next time.  But the 
final way that we know that cancer is a genetic disease is by looking in the DNA 
of a tumor, by looking at the genes themselves.  You know about genes.  You 
know about gene sequences.  You know how to figure out what the sequence of 
a gene is. 

When this is done in a cancer cell compared to a normal cell one finds mutations. 
And this is actually the very first cancer gene found in the context of human 
cancer.  It was found here at MIT by Bob Weinberg's lab.  And when its DNA was 
sequenced compared to the normal sequence shown above it incurred a 
mutation, a mutation which blocked the ability of this protein to be properly 
regulated leading to increased proliferation. 

And I'll tell you that story next time.
