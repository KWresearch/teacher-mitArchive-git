1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
We're going to discuss today the
definition that you two gave which

2
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
is making a genetically identical
copy in terms of organisms.

3
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
And I want to begin by
distinguishing with you the terms

4
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
reproductive and therapeutic
cloning.

5
00:00:35 --> 00:00:44
Reproductive cloning refers to

6
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
making a whole organism,
doing cloning with the intent,

7
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
and here we are in our board of life,
same place we were last time,

8
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
stem cells cloning, let's not dwell
there.  Reproductive cloning,

9
00:00:58 --> 00:01:03
the stuff that covers' of Time
Magazine are made of.

10
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
The outcomes of reproductive cloning,
the desired outcome is that you get

11
00:01:07 --> 00:01:15
the whole organism.

12
00:01:15 --> 00:01:21
And I want to distinguish that from
therapeutic cloning where the

13
00:01:21 --> 00:01:28
desired outcome is that you get some
kind of cells and specifically

14
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34
stem cells.
So reproductive cloning is the stuff

15
00:01:34 --> 00:01:39
of movies, it's the stuff of science
fiction and of people having fun

16
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44
with covers of the New York Times
Magazine.  It's also the subject of

17
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
scams.  And I'll tell you at the
outset, there are no human clones

18
00:01:49 --> 00:01:54
now.  Human cloning has not yet
worked, but I am sure someone

19
00:01:54 --> 00:01:59
somewhere is trying.
And we'll come back to that later

20
00:01:59 --> 00:02:04
one in the lecture.
The other type of cloning,

21
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
therapeutic cloning is something
that extends directly from our

22
00:02:09 --> 00:02:14
lecture last time.
When you think about stem cells and

23
00:02:14 --> 00:02:19
you think about using those in
repair, one of the issues that comes

24
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
up, and this comes up in any kind of
repair mechanism,

25
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
repair therapy, transplantation of
any kind is the question of autology

26
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
or self or matching,
whether or not the donated tissue

27
00:02:35 --> 00:02:40
genetically matches your own
If it doesn't your immune system is

28
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
going to try to reject it,
and if it does you have a lot of

29
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
problems.  The sense of therapeutic
cloning is that one may be able to

30
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
take cells from an adult person and
turn them into an embryo and then

31
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
use the embryo cells,
I'll tell you how in a moment,

32
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
and then use the resulting embryo
and the inner cell mass of the

33
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
embryo to make various stem cell
lines, as we discussed

34
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
in last lecture.
And the promise of therapeutic

35
00:03:08 --> 00:03:13
cloning is this autologous nature to
it, that you would get something

36
00:03:13 --> 00:03:18
that was an exact tissue match.
So let's discuss a bit more, why

37
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
one might want to do this various
types of cloning.

38
00:03:22 --> 00:03:27
In reproductive cloning there are
some senses of replacing people who

39
00:03:27 --> 00:03:32
have been lost,
some way of improving or overcoming

40
00:03:32 --> 00:03:37
infertility.
Spare parts, this is the stuff that

41
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
some good books have been made of.
House of the Scorpion from Nancy

42
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
Farmer.  If any of you have read
that it's directly relevant to this.

43
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
If you haven't, House of the
Scorpion it's called.

44
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
It's a very interesting book that
thinks about a time in our society

45
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
where we can clone exact copies of
ourselves.  And these copies are

46
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
made brain damages.
And they are kept in hospitals and

47
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
they are used for spare parts as the
real person ages.

48
00:04:06 --> 00:04:11
OK?  Sounds weird,
sounds peculiar, sounds unethical,

49
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
but it is possible.  And I suspect
there are people who would be quite

50
00:04:15 --> 00:04:20
keen on having this as something
that could be done.

51
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
Useful producer animals,
there's been a sense in the

52
00:04:24 --> 00:04:29
agricultural industry that if one
can make identical copies of

53
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
particular animals it would be very
useful in getting whole herds of

54
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
goats, for example,
that are making very high quantities

55
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
of a protein that is
pharmaceutically useful,

56
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
some kind of drug for example.
And there are in different ways.

57
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
That kind of approach has already
taken.  Therapeutic cloning,

58
00:04:51 --> 00:04:56
as I said, autologous stem cells and
the use, which I may or may not have

59
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
time to touch on,
of these cells in correcting genes

60
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
which are mutant and which are bad.
But let's step back for a moment

61
00:05:06 --> 00:05:12
because the question of cloning has
a long history.

62
00:05:12 --> 00:05:18
And its history really started with
a question that we have dwelt on for

63
00:05:18 --> 00:05:24
a number of lectures,
and this is the question of how cell

64
00:05:24 --> 00:05:30
types are determined.
And the question of when a cell type

65
00:05:30 --> 00:05:36
is determined,
whether or not that is accompanied

66
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
by some irrevocable change in the
DNA.  So this cell type

67
00:05:42 --> 00:05:49
determination,
or let's say differentiation because

68
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
that's the end point,
as you know, is cell type

69
00:05:55 --> 00:06:02
differentiation caused
by DNA change?

70
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
Or let me actually say DNA change or
DNA loss, which is the big one.

71
00:06:06 --> 00:06:11
And this question, and you could
imagine, as you form a retinal cell

72
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
or as you form a skin cell,
you might get these different cell

73
00:06:15 --> 00:06:20
types because you throw out,
you actually delete from the genome

74
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
whole batteries of genes.
OK?  Or you make lots of copies of

75
00:06:25 --> 00:06:30
another gene.  So you may actually
change the DNA.

76
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
You kind of know the answer to this
question because I've already told

77
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
you that all cells have pretty much
got the same amount of DNA,

78
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
the same type of DNA.  And what's
important is whether or not

79
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
different genes are active or not.
But how did I tell you that?  How

80
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
was I able to tell you that?
So let's spend a few minutes

81
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
exploring that.
So the first question that was

82
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
asked in terms of the cell type
differentiation question was the

83
00:06:56 --> 00:07:06
question of cellular potency.

84
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
Where cellular potency,
and we're on number two of your

85
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
handout, where cellular potency
asked in an early embryo,

86
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
when can an early embryonic cell or
set of cells support growth of the

87
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
entire organism?
In other words, at what time during

88
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
development is there totipotency,
is there complete information in the

89
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
cell?
And this is to exemplify the kind of

90
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
experiment that was done,
as exemplified here in the sea

91
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
urchin where you can take an eight
cell stage sea urchin embryo and

92
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
transect it in one plane or another
plane.  And if you do it in one

93
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
plane you get an abnormal embryo and
a normal embryo.

94
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
They say abnormal but it's sort of
normal-ish.  And in the other plane

95
00:07:53 --> 00:07:58
you get out two normal, but
small, larvae.  OK?

96
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
And what this said was that the
cells of this eight cell embryo are

97
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
not equivalent to one another.
And, indeed, even four cells put

98
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
together, if you bisect in the wrong
plane, was not sufficient to confer

99
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
totipotency to those cells.
So at the eight cell stage in the

100
00:08:16 --> 00:08:21
sea urchin, the cells are not
totipotent.  And you can do similar

101
00:08:21 --> 00:08:26
types of experiments
in many organisms.

102
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
And what you find is that in the
very early embryo,

103
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
you can often split the embryo into
its component cells and you can get

104
00:08:34 --> 00:08:39
out a number of genetically
identical organisms.

105
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
This clearly happens in humans in
the case of identical twins.

106
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
It happens in armadillos routinely
where armadillos,

107
00:08:47 --> 00:08:52
for their own reasons,
split into eight cells at the eight

108
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
cell stage, and you get identical
octuplets out of most armadillo

109
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
pregnancies.  OK?
So there's totipotency but it's

110
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
transient.
And this transient nature of this

111
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
cellular potency,
so the embryonic potency is

112
00:09:10 --> 00:09:18
transient.

113
00:09:18 --> 00:09:24
And the question was then raised why?
Was it something that happened to

114
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
the cytoplasm or was it something
that happened to the nucleus?

115
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
And this is where we get into the
questions of nuclear potency and the

116
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
beginnings of cloning
as we know it.

117
00:09:37 --> 00:09:44
And the technique that you need to

118
00:09:44 --> 00:09:49
know is called somatic cell
nuclear transfer.

119
00:09:49 --> 00:09:59
Abbreviated SCNT.

120
00:09:59 --> 00:10:04
All right.  So this is what SCNT
looks like.  This is number three on

121
00:10:04 --> 00:10:09
your handouts.
And it goes like this.

122
00:10:09 --> 00:10:14
One takes an egg, early embryonic
cell that you know is able to

123
00:10:14 --> 00:10:19
support total embryonic development
with its own nucleus,

124
00:10:19 --> 00:10:24
and you go in and you remove the egg
chromosomes.  You can do this

125
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
because most eggs are arrested at
meiotic metaphase two.

126
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
The chromosomes are condensed and
they are gelatinous,

127
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
and you can actually remove them.
I'll show you a movie of this in a

128
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
moment.  You can remove these egg
chromosomes, and you can then get a

129
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
nucleus from some adult or other
cell type.  And you can put it in a

130
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
glass pipette,
and you can pipette it into the

131
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
enucleated egg.
The egg heals up.

132
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
It's now got a substituted nucleus.
And you can go and you can ask what

133
00:10:58 --> 00:11:03
this egg which its somatic
nucleus can do.

134
00:11:03 --> 00:11:07
And the somatic cell nucleus is
diploid so you don't need

135
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
fertilization because you've already
got the right complement of

136
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
chromosomes.  And if you do that,
as was done in frogs in the early

137
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
1960s, you get results like this.
The host egg came from a frog which

138
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
was brown and the donor nucleus came
from a frog, or cells of a frog

139
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
which was albino.
And that was important because when

140
00:11:29 --> 00:11:34
you looked at all the cloned frogs
they were all albinos.

141
00:11:34 --> 00:11:38
OK.  And so you could see that they
came from the donor nuclei.

142
00:11:38 --> 00:11:43
Great question.

143
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
See me afterwards.
I actually don't know the answer.

144
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
That's a great question.  OK.  Here
are the cloned frogs.

145
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
OK?  And you can get buckets full
of these things,

146
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
but.  I've seen buckets full of
these things.  OK.

147
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
But.  OK.  But before the but.
So let's do a couple of things here.

148
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
So want I can tell you is that in a
500 cell frog embryo,

149
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
one can very clearly distinguish
cellular potency and nuclear potency

150
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
differences.  So if you take any
cells from a 500 cell frog embryo,

151
00:12:15 --> 00:12:20
you isolate the single cells and
culture them as single cells,

152
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
none of them will form an embryo.
However, if you isolate nuclei from

153
00:12:24 --> 00:12:29
each of those cells and transplant
those nuclei each into an enucleated

154
00:12:29 --> 00:12:34
egg, 100% of them will
form normal embryos.

155
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
So there is a massive difference
between cellular and nuclear potency

156
00:12:38 --> 00:12:43
at that stage.
It tells you that the nuclei are

157
00:12:43 --> 00:12:48
totipotent and the problem was with
the cytoplasm of the cell and that

158
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
the egg cytoplasm has got something
in it that is special to support

159
00:12:52 --> 00:12:57
development.  So that was a very
positive result,

160
00:12:57 --> 00:13:02
OK, that you could get these cloned
embryos, these cloned frogs from

161
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
nuclei that by cellular experiments
were not totipotent anymore, but --

162
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
But, and this is really important,
if you did that experiment with

163
00:13:11 --> 00:13:16
nuclei derived from older and older
embryo, here's blastula,

164
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
gastrula, neurula tail bud and so on
all the way up into adult cells,

165
00:13:20 --> 00:13:25
the frequency of embryos that arose
from, or frogs that arose from the

166
00:13:25 --> 00:13:30
somatic cell nuclear
transfer plummeted.

167
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
So if you did the experiment at
blastula stages you got 80%,

168
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
even 100% success rate with the
cloning with your somatic cell

169
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
nuclear transfer.
If you did it at gastrula it would

170
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
drop to 50%.  By late gastrula,
which is just in frogs, about five

171
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
hours after late blastula,
you were down at around 15%.

172
00:13:49 --> 00:13:53
And by the time a day later had
gone by and you were a tail bud

173
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
embryo, you were close to
zero percent success.

174
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
So although nuclei were totipotent
at some stage,

175
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
there was a tremendous decrease in
the potency of the nuclei as

176
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
development went on.
And so that raised issues,

177
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
which we'll come back to in a little
bit.  Now, after the success with

178
00:14:13 --> 00:14:18
frogs, people started looking to
mammals immediately to see if they

179
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
could clone mammals.
And there is a real checkered

180
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
history here and some shady science
and some claims particularly that in

181
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
mice one could clone mouse embryos
and could do it with

182
00:14:30 --> 00:14:35
high efficiency.
And it turned out that all of that

183
00:14:35 --> 00:14:40
data was faked,
and that really put a damper on the

184
00:14:40 --> 00:14:46
field for several decades.
And it wasn't until the folks in

185
00:14:46 --> 00:14:51
Edinburgh in 1997 tried again and
did it with an open mind that they

186
00:14:51 --> 00:14:56
were able to clone this sheep,
Dolly, who never knew how famous she

187
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
was, who was the first mammal who
was cloned by nuclear transfer.

188
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
So how does nuclear transfer work in
mammalian embryos?

189
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
The principle is identical to what
I've shown you in the frogs,

190
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
but I'm going to show you a few
movies to give you a sense of how

191
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
it's really done.
So this is a microscope that's set

192
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
up for somatic cell nuclear transfer.
And these things here are

193
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
micromanipulators,
including injection and suction

194
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
devices that I'll show
you in a minute.

195
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
I'm going to show you a series of
three movies that were made by a

196
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
very talent MIT graduate student,
Kevin Eggan who is now a fellow over

197
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
at Harvard, in Professor Rudolf
Jaenisch's lab,

198
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
one of my colleagues over at the
Whitehead Institute.

199
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
And the first movie is going to be
the isolation of nuclei

200
00:15:44 --> 00:15:51
from somatic cells.

201
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
So here is a glass pipette,
and Kevin is drawing up a cell into

202
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
the pipette.  And he is going to
spit out, he has, you'll

203
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
see it again.
He has spit out the contents of the

204
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
cell other than the nucleus.
So there's this little thing in

205
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
there that's a nucleus.
So here's another cell.

206
00:16:11 --> 00:16:15
He's pipetting it up and down to
break it open and is retaining the

207
00:16:15 --> 00:16:19
nucleus because it fits well in the
pipette and doesn't come out as

208
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
readily as the other cell contents.
There goes the cell into the

209
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
pipette, and here comes the cell
debris, and in the pipette is

210
00:16:27 --> 00:16:33
retained the nucleus.  OK.
Step two, removing the chromosomes

211
00:16:33 --> 00:16:39
from an unfertilized egg.
This thing is a suction device that

212
00:16:39 --> 00:16:45
sucks and holds the mouse egg.
Here is a microinjection needle.

213
00:16:45 --> 00:16:51
And it's not pointed because it's
actually being helped by an electric

214
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
pulse to enter the egg.
And Kevin is now pulling out the

215
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
metaphase plate from an egg.
Those are the chromosomes from the

216
00:17:02 --> 00:17:07
egg.  How does he know where they
are?  Well, he's a smart guy.

217
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
And if you've looked at enough
mouse eggs, you can actually see

218
00:17:11 --> 00:17:16
them under the right microscopy
conditions.  OK.

219
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
So there goes the pipette again and
here comes some more chromosomes.

220
00:17:21 --> 00:17:26
And there you go.  OK.  Easy when
you know how.

221
00:17:26 --> 00:17:37
There.  OK.  So once you've got your

222
00:17:37 --> 00:17:41
bucket load of eggs that are
enucleated and you've got your

223
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
pipette full of somatic cell nuclei,
you can put the two together.  So

224
00:17:45 --> 00:17:49
here's your enucleated egg held on
by suction and here's your pipette

225
00:17:49 --> 00:17:53
that has got those nuclei that came
from the somatic cells.

226
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
Watch the barrel of the pipette or
the microinjection pipette

227
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
and you will see it.
There is goes.

228
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
There's a nucleus going down into
the cell.  And if you watch

229
00:18:06 --> 00:18:10
carefully we will see when the
pipette comes out.

230
00:18:10 --> 00:18:15
You really have got to get it out
of there.  That nucleus is gone.

231
00:18:15 --> 00:18:19
OK.  Here's another one.  There's
the nucleus.  You've got to watch.

232
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
There it goes.  You can actually
see it going it out if you look

233
00:18:23 --> 00:18:28
carefully.  He's really making sure
he pushes it out.

234
00:18:28 --> 00:18:33
And there, another nucleus
somatically transferred.

235
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38
OK.  And the third one here is the
nucleus.  A little pulse of electric

236
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
current to get the pipette in,
and then you push the nucleus out by

237
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
pressure, and there you are.
And the last one, here's a lost

238
00:18:49 --> 00:19:03
nucleus.

239
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
There is goes.
All right.  OK.

240
00:19:09 --> 00:19:18
So this works.  It does work.

241
00:19:18 --> 00:19:22
These mice are living proof that
somatic cell nuclear transfer gives

242
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
clones and so is Dolly,
but there are issues.  There are

243
00:19:26 --> 00:19:35
many, many problems.

244
00:19:35 --> 00:19:39
Cloning by somatic cell nuclear
transfer is very inefficient.

245
00:19:39 --> 00:19:48
It depends somewhat on the species

246
00:19:48 --> 00:19:52
one has looked at,
but it is generally around or less

247
00:19:52 --> 00:19:57
than 1%.  So fewer than one in a
hundred of those mouse eggs actually

248
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
make it on to give you a mouse.
The ones that do,

249
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
although they might look normal,
turn out all to have something wrong

250
00:20:08 --> 00:20:13
with them.  So in mice 100% of the
animals that you get out have got

251
00:20:13 --> 00:20:19
something wrong with them.
And this is probably true in all

252
00:20:19 --> 00:20:24
clones that have been made.
It was true of Dolly who died an

253
00:20:24 --> 00:20:30
early death due to arthritis and
various other issues.

254
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
And it's true in essentially every
animal, in all animals that have

255
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
been carefully examined.
So what are the problems?

256
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
This is to remind you again that
cloning efficiency from adult nuclei

257
00:20:42 --> 00:20:47
is very low.  One of the problems,
and these animals would not be

258
00:20:47 --> 00:20:51
viable, is something called large
offspring syndrome.

259
00:20:51 --> 00:20:55
This is a normal newborn mouse and
this is a cloned mouse.

260
00:20:55 --> 00:20:59
And you can see that it's at least
double the size of

261
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
the normal mouse.
This is the placenta from the normal

262
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
mouse and from the cloned mouse also
enormous.  So there is an issue here

263
00:21:08 --> 00:21:13
with the size of embryos or the size
of the animals.

264
00:21:13 --> 00:21:17
There's also an issue with lifespan.
This is a survival curve for mice.

265
00:21:17 --> 00:21:22
And mice cloned animals are pretty
much all dead by about 750 days

266
00:21:22 --> 00:21:27
after birth.  Whereas,
for most wild type or even animals

267
00:21:27 --> 00:21:31
made by artificial reproductive
technologies, your survival is way,

268
00:21:31 --> 00:21:36
way longer than at.
At least double that time.

269
00:21:36 --> 00:21:41
So there is an issue with survival
in general.  And I'll show you a

270
00:21:41 --> 00:21:47
little bit, I pulled out a couple of
panels of some primary research data

271
00:21:47 --> 00:21:52
to show you that the reason these
animals are abnormal is because

272
00:21:52 --> 00:21:57
their gene expression is abnormal.
OK?  So this is a PCR-based assay

273
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
looking at various RNAs from various
different genes.

274
00:22:03 --> 00:22:07
OK?  These are,
each of these names up here is a

275
00:22:07 --> 00:22:11
gene name.  It doesn't matter what
they are.  And each of these white

276
00:22:11 --> 00:22:15
bands here is the demonstration that
an RNA is present.

277
00:22:15 --> 00:22:19
In a normal embryo there is a band
under each of these gene names

278
00:22:19 --> 00:22:23
indicating that the RNA is present.
In a cloned embryo, and this is

279
00:22:23 --> 00:22:27
true for all cloned embryos,
you see that at least three bands

280
00:22:27 --> 00:22:31
are missing.
And here's one I didn't diagram,

281
00:22:31 --> 00:22:35
didn't put an arrow on.  Four bands
are missing.  And in different

282
00:22:35 --> 00:22:40
cloned embryos different RNAs are
missing.  So you can show that in

283
00:22:40 --> 00:22:45
cloned embryos where you look gene
expression is abnormal.

284
00:22:45 --> 00:22:49
Why is gene expression abnormal?
Well, there are a couple of reasons.

285
00:22:49 --> 00:22:54
One is that in fact we're wrong and
that the DNA content of cells really

286
00:22:54 --> 00:23:00
is changing as they get older.
But that's not supported by projects

287
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
like the Human Genome Project which
suggests that the genes,

288
00:23:06 --> 00:23:12
in fact, are stable in all cells.
A much more plausible and accepted

289
00:23:12 --> 00:23:19
explanation of the data has to do
with the control of gene expression.

290
00:23:19 --> 00:23:25
And an aspect of the control of
gene expression that we have

291
00:23:25 --> 00:23:31
mentioned, although not by this
particular term.

292
00:23:31 --> 00:23:38
And so I want to introduce you to a
new term which is epigenetics.

293
00:23:38 --> 00:23:44
Epigenetics means outside genetics.

294
00:23:44 --> 00:23:46
And this refers to the control of
gene expression that does not

295
00:23:46 --> 00:23:49
directly bear on the DNA sequence.
We can have an argument about this

296
00:23:49 --> 00:23:51
later, but that's how I'm going to
define it now.

297
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
This refers to the regulation of
gene expression --

298
00:23:54 --> 00:24:03
-- that is not base

299
00:24:03 --> 00:24:17
sequence directed.

300
00:24:17 --> 00:24:23
That is not directed by the DNA base
sequence. All right.

301
00:24:23 --> 00:24:29
And I wrote it for you.
Let's look at some examples.

302
00:24:29 --> 00:24:33
This is a cloned cat.
This is a kitten and this is its

303
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
mom.  And you can see they're very
cute but they are different from one

304
00:24:37 --> 00:24:42
another.  OK?  They're different but
they've got exactly the same DNA

305
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
content.  They're different.
They're expressing different genes.

306
00:24:46 --> 00:24:51
OK?  This is where we've been.
Let's move somewhere else.

307
00:24:51 --> 00:24:55
I would think we might have someone
who is one of an identical twin pair

308
00:24:55 --> 00:25:00
in the class.  Anyone
an identical twin?

309
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
Oh, yeah.  Well,
we're statistically borderline.

310
00:25:03 --> 00:25:07
They're one in a thousand.  So we
don't have it.

311
00:25:07 --> 00:25:11
Do we have fraternal twins?
Are you a fraternal twin?  One.

312
00:25:11 --> 00:25:15
OK.  All right.  A few.  OK.  So
there we're OK.

313
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
All right.  OK.
Identical twins.

314
00:25:19 --> 00:25:23
Identical twins are generally not
absolutely identical.

315
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
They might look a bit different,
they might have different behaviors,

316
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
and they may have different more
quantitative traits.

317
00:25:31 --> 00:25:35
The term concordance refers to
whether or not twins share a trait.

318
00:25:35 --> 00:25:39
And that's particularly useful in
looking to see whether diseases are

319
00:25:39 --> 00:25:44
causes by DNA based mutations.
There's something called

320
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
scleroderma which is a skin disorder
that has 98% concordance.

321
00:25:48 --> 00:25:53
If one twin has it the other twin
has it.  And it is directed by

322
00:25:53 --> 00:25:57
specific changes in the DNA sequence.
On the other hand,

323
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
asthma only has a 54% concordance.
And that suggests that asthma is

324
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06
directed, this is a high concordance,
it's higher than fraternal twins

325
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
have, but it certainly doesn't reach
the heights of scleroderma.

326
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
And what the data suggests is that
scleroderma is caused only due to

327
00:26:14 --> 00:26:19
changes in DNA base sequence and
asthma is caused due to changes in

328
00:26:19 --> 00:26:23
the DNA base sequence as well as
something else,

329
00:26:23 --> 00:26:27
and the something else is believed
to be changes in gene expression

330
00:26:27 --> 00:26:31
that are regulated above the level,
at a different level than the base

331
00:26:31 --> 00:26:35
sequence per se.
Now, if we think back to molecular

332
00:26:35 --> 00:26:39
biology and the regulation of
transcription,

333
00:26:39 --> 00:26:42
I pulled this slide from one of your
previous handouts,

334
00:26:42 --> 00:26:46
your gene, your promoter and your
promoter activity leading to

335
00:26:46 --> 00:26:50
production of RNA.
That is the level of gene

336
00:26:50 --> 00:26:53
expression that seems to go wrong in
cloned embryos.

337
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57
We talked about regulation of
transcription by binding of

338
00:26:57 --> 00:27:01
transcription factors
to the promoter.

339
00:27:01 --> 00:27:06
And you've just had an exam on this
previously.  And also by something

340
00:27:06 --> 00:27:11
called chromatin modification.
And epigenetics has to do with

341
00:27:11 --> 00:27:16
chromatin.  Again,
this is an old slide.

342
00:27:16 --> 00:27:21
You've had it previously.
And I pointed out to you that DNA

343
00:27:21 --> 00:27:26
is packaged into tightly wound coils
called chromatin by winding around

344
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
particular proteins.
And the particular proteins it winds

345
00:27:31 --> 00:27:35
around specifically are called
histones, and these histones and the

346
00:27:35 --> 00:27:39
DNA wound around them are inhibitory
to transcription and they must be

347
00:27:39 --> 00:27:43
loosened up or removed to allow
transcription to take place.

348
00:27:43 --> 00:27:47
So bear that in mind while I tell
you something else that can happen

349
00:27:47 --> 00:27:51
to DNA.  DNA can be covalently
modified, and this is on your

350
00:27:51 --> 00:27:55
handout.  This is number six on your
handout.  DNA can be covalently

351
00:27:55 --> 00:27:59
modified.
In particular,

352
00:27:59 --> 00:28:03
cytosine, the base cytosine can have
a methyl group added to its 5

353
00:28:03 --> 00:28:07
position, and it is now called
5-methylcytosine.

354
00:28:07 --> 00:28:11
And this does not change the base
sequence of the DNA,

355
00:28:11 --> 00:28:14
but it does have a profound affect
on whether or not the DNA is

356
00:28:14 --> 00:28:18
transcriptionally active.
So let me go through a cartoon with

357
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
you to indicate how this is,
and then I'll come back to the

358
00:28:22 --> 00:28:26
relevance of this for cloned animals
and their abnormalities.

359
00:28:26 --> 00:28:30
So this is number seven on your
handout.

360
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
The DNA that I've shown in black,
and I've shown double-stranded DNA

361
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
as a single line here so don't get
confused, is wound around purple

362
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
barrels of histone proteins.
And this chromatin configuration

363
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
where the DNA is wound around
histone proteins has to be removed

364
00:28:46 --> 00:28:50
or has to be modified to activate
transcription.

365
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
When the histones are removed the
transcription factors can do their

366
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
thing and you can get transcription
taking place.

367
00:28:58 --> 00:29:04
And it turns out that when the DNA
is methylated that does not happen.

368
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
Methylation prevents the removal of
the histones from the DNA template,

369
00:29:10 --> 00:29:16
from the gene, and thereby prevents
transcription from taking place from

370
00:29:16 --> 00:29:22
a gene.  OK?  So on the handout that
I've posted on the Web,

371
00:29:22 --> 00:29:28
I have put an explanation of why
methylation prevents

372
00:29:28 --> 00:29:34
histone removal.
I'm not going to go through it in

373
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
class, but you can go and look at it
for your interest on the Web posted.

374
00:29:38 --> 00:29:43
OK?  But what I want you to have in
your minds now is that methylation

375
00:29:43 --> 00:29:48
prevents DNA removal.
Now, methylation therefore,

376
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
because it can repress transcription,
is used by this body to use by the

377
00:29:52 --> 00:29:57
cell as a mechanism to regulate
which genes are active

378
00:29:57 --> 00:30:02
and which cell type.
So in cell type one where there's a

379
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
gene that I have depicted as so,
double-stranded and there's a

380
00:30:06 --> 00:30:11
promoter, no methylation,
it's expressed.  That same gene in

381
00:30:11 --> 00:30:16
cell type two might be methylated
and therefore not expressed.

382
00:30:16 --> 00:30:20
This is number nine on your handout.
Reciprocally gene two might be

383
00:30:20 --> 00:30:25
methylated in cell type one where
it's not expressed,

384
00:30:25 --> 00:30:30
not methylated in cell type two
where it is expressed and so on.

385
00:30:30 --> 00:30:34
And what you can get from this is
that in a particular cell type a set

386
00:30:34 --> 00:30:39
of genes will have a characteristic
methylation pattern.

387
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
And you can get a kind of
methylation profile of the entire

388
00:30:43 --> 00:30:48
genome that dictates which genes are
going to be active and which are not

389
00:30:48 --> 00:30:53
active, or is one level of
regulation that dictates which genes

390
00:30:53 --> 00:30:58
are active and expressed
and which are not.

391
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
There is another level of
methylation that has to do with

392
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
what's in the egg and the sperm and
what methylation patterns are there.

393
00:31:06 --> 00:31:10
And it turns out that not only are
there cell type specific methylation

394
00:31:10 --> 00:31:14
differences but there are gender
specific differences.

395
00:31:14 --> 00:31:18
And the methylation patterns of
female genes, of genes in the female

396
00:31:18 --> 00:31:22
are different than some of the
methylation patterns of genes in the

397
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
male.  This particular kind of
methylation difference is called

398
00:31:26 --> 00:31:31
imprinting.  Here's an example.
Here's a gene.

399
00:31:31 --> 00:31:35
Gene one in the egg has a
particular methylation pattern.

400
00:31:35 --> 00:31:40
That same gene two, gene one in the
sperm has a different methylation

401
00:31:40 --> 00:31:44
pattern.  OK?  And this difference
makes it a so-called imprinted gene.

402
00:31:44 --> 00:31:49
Here's gene two.  Also differences
between the male and the female

403
00:31:49 --> 00:31:54
copies of the genes.
And here's gene three which has the

404
00:31:54 --> 00:31:58
same methylation pattern in both egg
and sperm and is therefore

405
00:31:58 --> 00:32:03
not imprinted.
So there are these two kinds of

406
00:32:03 --> 00:32:07
methylation that take place,
the cell type specific and the

407
00:32:07 --> 00:32:12
gender specific.
And these all get put together into

408
00:32:12 --> 00:32:16
a complicated arrangement of
changing methylation patterns during

409
00:32:16 --> 00:32:21
development.  And I'm going to go
through this.  This is number ten on

410
00:32:21 --> 00:32:26
your handout.  And I'm going to go
through this as an animated cartoon.

411
00:32:26 --> 00:32:30
So here is, represented by the
colors, the methylation pattern in

412
00:32:30 --> 00:32:35
the egg and in the sperm.
They are imprinted with their own

413
00:32:35 --> 00:32:39
methylation patterns.
During fertilization they join to

414
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
form a zygote which goes on to make
an embryo.  Now,

415
00:32:43 --> 00:32:47
early on during embryogenesis some
cells are set aside.

416
00:32:47 --> 00:32:51
And we looked at this with
determinants in Caenorhabditis.

417
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
Some cells are set aside to make
the future germ cells.

418
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59
And very interestingly as that
happens there is a demethylation of

419
00:32:59 --> 00:33:04
all the imprinting
of methyl groups.

420
00:33:04 --> 00:33:08
And as those germ cells then go onto
become egg or sperm new methylation

421
00:33:08 --> 00:33:12
takes place and you get the
imprinted patterns put back on egg

422
00:33:12 --> 00:33:17
and sperm appropriately.
It's a complicated process.

423
00:33:17 --> 00:33:21
And if you think about it a little
you'll see there are some real

424
00:33:21 --> 00:33:26
issues there, but I'm throwing this
out as a cartoon.

425
00:33:26 --> 00:33:30
Also in the embryo new methylation
patterns arise that I've called

426
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
embryonic methylation patterns.
So there are enzymes that are adding

427
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
these methyl groups onto cytosine,
and there are a bunch of different

428
00:33:38 --> 00:33:42
enzymes.  And in the embryo there
are new methylation patterns that

429
00:33:42 --> 00:33:45
arise.  And as the embryo goes
through its thing and makes its

430
00:33:45 --> 00:33:49
different cell types,
additional new methylation patterns

431
00:33:49 --> 00:33:53
arise.  I've called these somatic
methylation patterns.

432
00:33:53 --> 00:33:57
And they are different in the
different cell types, as

433
00:33:57 --> 00:34:01
I've just shown you.
So there is this complicated way of

434
00:34:01 --> 00:34:06
changing methylation patterns during
development, and this has

435
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
implications for the chromatin
structure and it regulates the

436
00:34:12 --> 00:34:17
expression of genes in different
cell types.  It is one important

437
00:34:17 --> 00:34:22
level of gene regulation.
And for cloning purposes you should

438
00:34:22 --> 00:34:28
know that adult methylation patterns
never normally revert to

439
00:34:28 --> 00:34:33
embryonic patterns.
The germ cells are set aside very

440
00:34:33 --> 00:34:38
early during embryogenesis,
and once that has happened you go on

441
00:34:38 --> 00:34:43
and make all these new methylation
patterns and you never turn them

442
00:34:43 --> 00:34:48
back.  OK.  So what does this have
to do with cloning?

443
00:34:48 --> 00:34:54
Well, the problem with clones and
the problem with gene expression in

444
00:34:54 --> 00:34:59
clones, it is believed,
is that there is a problem with

445
00:34:59 --> 00:35:04
changing the methylation patterns
and the chromatin structure back to

446
00:35:04 --> 00:35:09
the embryonic structure.
So in normal developments,

447
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
I've summarized the cartoon that I
just showed you in complicated form,

448
00:35:13 --> 00:35:18
you move from some kind of egg-sperm
methylation state that moves on,

449
00:35:18 --> 00:35:23
that allows you to move on to
activate the early embryonic genes.

450
00:35:23 --> 00:35:27
And because you have put in the
appropriate embryonic methylation

451
00:35:27 --> 00:35:32
patterns.  And then in a stepwise
way you go on to act two,

452
00:35:32 --> 00:35:37
form the adult methylation patterns
and activate the adult genes.

453
00:35:37 --> 00:35:42
OK?  So there's a connection between
the methylation patterns and correct

454
00:35:42 --> 00:35:47
gene expressions.
This is a summary of the big

455
00:35:47 --> 00:35:52
cartoon I just showed you.
After somatic cell nuclear transfer

456
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
there are three possible outcomes
with regard to methylation patterns

457
00:35:57 --> 00:36:02
and with the prognosis for the
health of the resulting embryo.

458
00:36:02 --> 00:36:07
One outcome is that this adult donor
nucleus that has its adult

459
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
methylation patterns,
when injected into enucleated egg,

460
00:36:12 --> 00:36:17
will undergo some kind of
reprogramming and will land up with

461
00:36:17 --> 00:36:22
a normal embryonic set of
methylation patterns.

462
00:36:22 --> 00:36:27
If it does that it will be able to
support normal development.

463
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
However, it is believed that this
very, very rarely, probably

464
00:36:32 --> 00:36:36
never happens.
What is much more likely is that

465
00:36:36 --> 00:36:40
this adult donor nucleus,
when injected into an enucleated egg,

466
00:36:40 --> 00:36:43
goes on and is partially
reprogrammed by the enzymes that are

467
00:36:43 --> 00:36:47
present in the egg.
And it goes on to set up some kind

468
00:36:47 --> 00:36:51
of abnormal set of methylation
patterns, some of which look like

469
00:36:51 --> 00:36:54
the embryonic patterns,
some of which look like the adult

470
00:36:54 --> 00:36:58
patterns.  And it goes on
correspondeningly to activate gene

471
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
expression abnormally.
And, therefore,

472
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
to make an abnormal embryo.
And then a third outcome is that

473
00:37:06 --> 00:37:11
you just don't reprogram this
nucleus at all,

474
00:37:11 --> 00:37:16
and it's an adult nucleus sitting in
the egg.  And in that case you get

475
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
no embryo resulting from the somatic
cell nuclear transfer at all.

476
00:37:20 --> 00:37:25
So it is, and this is number 12 on
your slide, on your handout.

477
00:37:25 --> 00:37:29
So the notion now is that abnormal
clones are abnormal because of an

478
00:37:29 --> 00:37:34
inability to reprogram the DNA,
they methylation patterns and the

479
00:37:34 --> 00:37:39
chromatin structure to turn you into
a normal embryo.

480
00:37:39 --> 00:37:44
So let's move on to the final thing
I want to discuss with you today

481
00:37:44 --> 00:37:49
which are issues.
Issues with somatic cell nuclear

482
00:37:49 --> 00:37:55
transfer and the whole notion of
cloning.  And I have a list of them

483
00:37:55 --> 00:38:00
here.  They fall into two categories.
One are the ethical issues and the

484
00:38:00 --> 00:38:06
other are the methodological
issues.

485
00:38:06 --> 00:38:09
We raised last time the ethics of
using human embryos to make human

486
00:38:09 --> 00:38:13
stem cell lines.
And this ethical issue is still

487
00:38:13 --> 00:38:17
there.  Is it acceptable to take a
human embryo at the blastocystic

488
00:38:17 --> 00:38:21
stage, when it's a ball of cells and
to harvest it,

489
00:38:21 --> 00:38:25
to kill it, to take the cells and to
make stem cell lines?

490
00:38:25 --> 00:38:29
Someone asked me whether you
couldn't take one cell out of that

491
00:38:29 --> 00:38:33
embryo and make a cell line out of
that embryo and let the rest

492
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
of the embryo grow.
And in theory you actually could do

493
00:38:37 --> 00:38:41
that.  It would be a pain in the
neck, but you actually in theory

494
00:38:41 --> 00:38:45
could do that.
OK?  But that's not a possibility

495
00:38:45 --> 00:38:49
that's really being seriously
entertained.  This whole use of

496
00:38:49 --> 00:38:53
human embryos to support actually
making a whole organism has its real

497
00:38:53 --> 00:38:57
issues.  What if you do that and you
land up with as you do in the mice

498
00:38:57 --> 00:39:02
and the cows and the sheep and the
everything else?

499
00:39:02 --> 00:39:06
You land up with a whole bunch of
abnormal human beings,

500
00:39:06 --> 00:39:10
what are you going to do about this?
What's the fate of them, what's

501
00:39:10 --> 00:39:14
your commitment to these abnormal
babies and what is the commitment of

502
00:39:14 --> 00:39:18
society here?  These are very big
issues.  Another issue,

503
00:39:18 --> 00:39:22
which is a very real one,
is where are the eggs that you're

504
00:39:22 --> 00:39:26
going to do all this somatic cell
nuclear transfer going to come from?

505
00:39:26 --> 00:39:30
So there was a recent report from a
Korean group who had actually made a

506
00:39:30 --> 00:39:34
human stem cell line after somatic
cell nuclear transfer.

507
00:39:34 --> 00:39:38
They had used 650 human eggs.
And they had used 16 women to

508
00:39:38 --> 00:39:43
donate these 650 eggs.
At the present rate of making

509
00:39:43 --> 00:39:48
clones and making stem cell lines,
you would probably need at least 500

510
00:39:48 --> 00:39:53
to 1,000 human eggs per attempt to
get autologous stem cells.

511
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
Now, I told you previously,
when we talked about assisted

512
00:39:57 --> 00:40:02
reproductive technology and you
retrieve oocytes from the ovary and

513
00:40:02 --> 00:40:07
do in vitro fertilization,
you usually get about 20 oocytes

514
00:40:07 --> 00:40:12
every time you try to get
eggs from a donor.

515
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
That's a lot of people who have to
donate these eggs.

516
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
And if you're actually going to try
and grow these into babies that's a

517
00:40:20 --> 00:40:24
lot of surrogate mothers.
So this is an issue that has not

518
00:40:24 --> 00:40:28
been resolved or even discussed
really very well.

519
00:40:28 --> 00:40:32
But these are the ethical issues
that make these scientific issues

520
00:40:32 --> 00:40:36
move into the realm of legislature.
There is currently a federal ban on

521
00:40:36 --> 00:40:40
using federal money to make human
stem cell lines.

522
00:40:40 --> 00:40:44
So you cannot use money from the
National Institutes of Health to do

523
00:40:44 --> 00:40:48
this.  There is no actual ban on
trying to clone humans per se.

524
00:40:48 --> 00:40:52
There is a gridlock because it's
not clear whether to separate

525
00:40:52 --> 00:40:56
therapeutic and reproductive cloning
from one another,

526
00:40:56 --> 00:41:01
but these are issues that are very
loaded.

527
00:41:01 --> 00:41:05
And, as I mentioned last time,
in the Massachusetts House we just

528
00:41:05 --> 00:41:09
approved the use of private funding
to make human stem cell lines in

529
00:41:09 --> 00:41:13
Massachusetts,
but not the use of federal funding.

530
00:41:13 --> 00:41:18
We cannot do that.  OK.  Methods.
To date no primate has been cloned.

531
00:41:18 --> 00:41:22
There is something difficult about
cloning primates.

532
00:41:22 --> 00:41:26
No human, no monkey has been cloned
yet.  Why?  What's the problem?

533
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
Not clear at this point, but I
suspect those problems will be

534
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
overcome in the near future.
OK.  Some other thoughts.

535
00:41:35 --> 00:41:39
What about these eggs?  I told you
the source of eggs for somatic cell

536
00:41:39 --> 00:41:43
nuclear transfer in humans is a big
issue.  What if you could turn ES

537
00:41:43 --> 00:41:47
cells into eggs?
Could you treat then with something

538
00:41:47 --> 00:41:51
and turn them into eggs?
And that would overcome the need

539
00:41:51 --> 00:41:55
for donors.  Well,
in fact, an experiment was published

540
00:41:55 --> 00:41:59
a little while ago showing that you
could take ES cells and you could

541
00:41:59 --> 00:42:04
activate them in various ways.
And activate expression of these

542
00:42:04 --> 00:42:09
proteins that you should recognize,
ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3.  Remember those?

543
00:42:09 --> 00:42:13
Yes?  OK, the zona pellucida
proteins.  So that you could take

544
00:42:13 --> 00:42:18
these cells and at least start
turning them into eggs.

545
00:42:18 --> 00:42:23
That's the sense that you might be
able to do.  OK.

546
00:42:23 --> 00:42:28
And then finally the question of
how can you reprogram these adult

547
00:42:28 --> 00:42:33
nuclei to make the whole process
more efficient?

548
00:42:33 --> 00:42:37
And I'll end with telling you two
thoughts that are being entertained

549
00:42:37 --> 00:42:42
by people in the field.
One of them is to take an adult

550
00:42:42 --> 00:42:46
donor nucleus and to try to
reprogram it into an embryonic state

551
00:42:46 --> 00:42:51
sequentially.  So if you take the
adult donor nucleus --

552
00:42:51 --> 00:42:59
Thank you.  If you take the adult

553
00:42:59 --> 00:43:03
donor nucleus,
you inject it into an enucleated egg,

554
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
you let it partially reprogram,
and then you take the nucleus out of

555
00:43:07 --> 00:43:11
that partial embryo and put it into
a new egg, that nucleus does much,

556
00:43:11 --> 00:43:15
much better.  And that's true in
frogs as well.

557
00:43:15 --> 00:43:19
And you can then sequentially
reactivate the genetic program.

558
00:43:19 --> 00:43:23
And that's actually one of the best
arguments that the genetic material

559
00:43:23 --> 00:43:27
really does stay the same.
And it's a problem with the

560
00:43:27 --> 00:43:31
chromatin structure of the DNA.
And the other dream that people are

561
00:43:31 --> 00:43:35
pursuing is to take these adult
donor nuclei and incubate them in

562
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
some kind of reprogramming extract,
some mix of proteins that will

563
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
magically change the chromatin
structure of the nucleus and allow

564
00:43:44 --> 00:43:49
it to revert to a normal embryonic
nucleus so it an go on and do its

565
00:43:49 --> 00:43:52
thing.  And I am going to stop there.
And thank you very much.
