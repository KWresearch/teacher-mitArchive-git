1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:28
OK.  I think we'll get started.

2
00:00:28 --> 00:00:36
So we're going to continue our

3
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
discussion today about viruses,
finish talking about influenza,

4
00:00:41 --> 00:00:47
influenza A virus and the flu,
and then talk a bit about HIV and

5
00:00:47 --> 00:00:52
AIDS.  Do you guys know more about
the tutorial session and so on and

6
00:00:52 --> 00:00:58
so forth for next week?
Has that been decided yet?  OK.

7
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
So you'll get more information
Monday and Wednesday.

8
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
And I'll also have an office hour,
probably a couple of office hours at

9
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
the end of next week.
Most likely, if it doesn't conflict

10
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
with this tutorial session that's
being planned,

11
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
it will be during this hour from
11:00 probably until 1:00 in this

12
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
room because it's free since we're
usually here.  But that may conflict

13
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
with you guys so we'll have to see.
I'll let you know on Monday.

14
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
So, again, the situation with
viruses is an ongoing one.

15
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
And, actually, one of you brought
to my attention an outbreak of polio

16
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
that's happening now both in Africa
and Indonesia.

17
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
This is actually from today's CNN.
om where there's a fear that polio

18
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
is starting to spread.
In this case in Jakarta,

19
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
in Indonesia.  And there's a very
extensive reaction to this.

20
00:01:51 --> 00:01:56
There's a great fear that polio
will spread.

21
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
This is an area that is not well
protected currently by polio

22
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
vaccination.  And so if you look at
this you'll see that they are

23
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
raising lots of money in order to
try to vaccinate with standard polio

24
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
vaccines, which work extremely well,
5.2 million children, to try to stop

25
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
the spread of this potential
epidemic of polio.

26
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
It hasn't reached anything near
those levels to be that concerned,

27
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
but in order to protect against that
possibility they're going

28
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
to vaccinate.
And, obviously,

29
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
if you vaccinate,
individuals cannot be successfully

30
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
infected.  If they cannot be
successfully infected,

31
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
the virus cannot propagate so they
cannot pass it on.

32
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
So you just close off the
infectious cycle in a very small

33
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
circle of infected individuals.
Also, in today's Globe, there was a

34
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
discussion of a local company that
makes vaccines against smallpox.

35
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
And I've mentioned to you that
smallpox is largely eliminated,

36
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
if not fully eliminated in the world,
but there are stocks of smallpox in

37
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
freezers around the world.
And there is a concern that an

38
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
individual could access smallpox
virus or make one because the

39
00:03:03 --> 00:03:08
relevant sequences of the genome of
the smallpox virus is known.

40
00:03:08 --> 00:03:13
And so, in theory, you could
synthesize your own smallpox virus

41
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17
genome, and thereby create your own
smallpox virus and expose now

42
00:03:17 --> 00:03:22
unprotected individuals because we
don't get vaccinated currently

43
00:03:22 --> 00:03:27
against smallpox.
And so there are companies like

44
00:03:27 --> 00:03:32
this one that are making currently
and distributing smallpox vaccines.

45
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
They distributed 182 million doses
in this country alone just in case

46
00:03:36 --> 00:03:40
somebody tried to deliberately
release some smallpox.

47
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
So that's what we can do when we
know what we're dealing with.

48
00:03:44 --> 00:03:49
We can create effective vaccines.
In this case they're effective, but

49
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
sometimes we get exposed to stuff
that we cannot effectively deal with.

50
00:03:53 --> 00:03:58
And I introduced this
to you last time.

51
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
This was the major flu pandemic from
1918.  Some people worried that

52
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
there might be another pandemic this
year because in the off season

53
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
between 1918 and 1919 when this
happened, and 20 to 40 million

54
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
people died, that's when the Red Sox
last won the World Series.

55
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
[LAUGHTER]  So the Armageddon folks
thought maybe this was the year,

56
00:04:20 --> 00:04:25
but so far so good.  So, as I
mentioned last time,

57
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
this was a major outbreak and a
major problem worldwide.

58
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
But you also should know that
influenza is an annual problem.

59
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
And I, for one, didn't appreciate
this.

60
00:04:40 --> 00:04:47.5
Where there are about 25 thousand

61
00:04:47 --> 00:04:52.5
deaths per year in the United States.
And, of course,

62
00:04:52 --> 00:04:57.5
to deal with that we make available,
especially to the elderly and

63
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
infirmed immunodeficient flu shots.
And flu shots are simply flu

64
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
vaccines.  And I'll tell you a
little bit about how they're made

65
00:05:06 --> 00:05:11
towards the end of this section,
but they're generally effective in

66
00:05:11 --> 00:05:16
combating against the flu that is
going to hit the population that

67
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
year.  And they change every year
because, as you'll see,

68
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
flu changes all the time as well.
So it's an annual problem.  There

69
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
are occasional epidemics which you
could think of as --

70
00:05:30 --> 00:05:37
-- population-based infection where

71
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
many individuals within a particular
population are infected.

72
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
And the virus, in this case,
is spreading throughout that

73
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
population.  And there are even more
occasional pandemics.

74
00:05:55 --> 00:06:04
And that's a worldwide infection.

75
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
Where, because of the virulence of
the virus and its ability to access

76
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
different populations and the
absence of immunity throughout the

77
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
worldwide population,
lots and lots of people get infected.

78
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
And that's what happened in 1918.
So how do we explain this?  How do

79
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
we explain the occasional epidemics
of a virus that we're so familiar

80
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
with?  Flu, as I said,
we get every year, lots of people

81
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
get it every year.
And, yet, we seem to be susceptible

82
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
year after year.
So why is that?  What causes the

83
00:06:35 --> 00:06:40
resistance to this immunity in small
measure and in large measure?

84
00:06:40 --> 00:06:45
And that's what I want to review
for you today.

85
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
So this is the responsible agent.
It's a virus, of course.  More

86
00:06:49 --> 00:06:54
specifically, it's an enveloped
virus, which means it has its own

87
00:06:54 --> 00:06:59
lipid bilayer that it picked up from
the host cell.

88
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
And you'll notice on the outside are
things sticking out of the bilayer.

89
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
These are proteins encoded by the
virus which are going to be

90
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
responsible for binding the virus to
the host cell.

91
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
And also allowing the viral
membrane to fuse with the host cell

92
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
membrane.  And you'll see that
that's done in the case of flu virus

93
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
in a slightly different way than for
some other viruses.

94
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
And then inside you have the capsid.
And wrapped up in this protein,

95
00:07:24 --> 00:07:28
this helical protein structure are
the nucleic acids of the virus.

96
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34.5
And the nucleic acids of this virus
are multiple.  That is it's not just

97
00:07:34 --> 00:07:41
one.  Oops.  It's not just one.
It's actually several.

98
00:07:41 --> 00:07:54
So, again, it's called influenza A

99
00:07:54 --> 00:08:00
virus.  It's an example
of an enveloped virus.

100
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
And I said you should note the
envelope proteins,

101
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
which are largely encoded by the
virus itself.  And we call these

102
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
envelope glycoproteins.
Glycoproteins because when they

103
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
emerge through the sorting pathway
of the cell they pick up sugars.

104
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
And so when they're on the outside
of the cell, it's not just protein.

105
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
There is some sugar there, so
glycoproteins.

106
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
And sometimes the antibodies that
we make are directed against the

107
00:08:28 --> 00:08:33
sugar moieties alone or in
combination with peptides.

108
00:08:33 --> 00:08:39
So the envelope glycoproteins are
important.  As I said,

109
00:08:39 --> 00:08:45
it's a segmented RNA genome,
which means that there are multiple

110
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
distinct nucleic acids in the viral
particle.  And in the case of flu

111
00:08:51 --> 00:09:06
there are eight.

112
00:09:06 --> 00:09:11
The RNA genome is single-stranded.
And all of the genome segments are

113
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
in the minus configuration.
So their sequence is the complement

114
00:09:16 --> 00:09:21
to the mRNA.  OK?
And we talked about the

115
00:09:21 --> 00:09:26
significance of RNA viruses that
have a minus strand polarity in the

116
00:09:26 --> 00:09:32
sense that they need to have their
own RNA polymerase coming in with

117
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
the virus in order to help,
in order to initiate the replication

118
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41.75
cycle.
So, hopefully,

119
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45.25
that's familiar from last time.
This is a diagram of the virus,

120
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48.75
and it just makes the same points I
just made.  So,

121
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52.25
again, it has a lipid bilayer.
It has envelope glycoproteins

122
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55.75
sticking out from the surface.
You'll see that they're important

123
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59.25
for different things in a moment.
Inside that is a nucleocapsid which

124
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
surrounds the nucleic acids.
And you can see that there's a

125
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
series of nucleic acids that are
enclosed within this.

126
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
And, again, there are eight of them.
And they're all minus strand.

127
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
And, importantly, contained within
here is a protein,

128
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
an RNA dependent RNA polymerase,
the yellow dot.  And it has to get

129
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
incorporated with the virus so that
when the virus infects it goes in

130
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27.72
there, too.  And it can then act on
the RNA genome and convert it into a

131
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
plus strand, which will then serve
both as the RNA for translation,

132
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
as well as the template for the
production of more of the

133
00:10:35 --> 00:10:40.1
minus strand RNA.
OK?  So this comes from your book,

134
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
and it is a summary of the
infectious cycle of this virus.

135
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48.5
I've modified it a little bit
because some of the details which I

136
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52.7
think are important were missing.
So you might want to pay attention

137
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56.9
to this figure as you're reading the
section, the relevant

138
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
section in the book.
But this is a typical viral

139
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
lifecycle.  The virus attaches.
Remember, the terms that I used

140
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
last time?  The virus attaches.
Here one of the viral glycoproteins

141
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
binds to a protein on the surface of
the target cell.

142
00:11:13 --> 00:11:18
That then initiates an
internalization process,

143
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
a penetration process in which the
virus gets brought in through an

144
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
endosome.  So it gets brought in
through a separate vesicle,

145
00:11:26 --> 00:11:30
an endosome.  That vesicle, the
endosome then fuses with a lysosome,

146
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35.25
not shown here.
And you may recall that the

147
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39.75
lysosomes have very low pH.
And it's in the context of the low

148
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44.25
pH that one of the viral
glycoproteins changes its shape.

149
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48.75
And when it changes its shape it
allows the viral membrane to fuse

150
00:11:48 --> 00:11:53.25
with the membrane of the lysosome.
So this is a pH-dependant protein

151
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57.75
conformational change which turns an
inner protein into a protein that

152
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
facilitates fusion.
And when that happens,

153
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
the viral capsid can then slip out
into the cytoplasm.

154
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
It gets unpackaged.
The RNA, which is the minus strand

155
00:12:10 --> 00:12:14
RNA gets released.
And then it gets acted on by that

156
00:12:14 --> 00:12:18
RNA dependent RNA polymerase that
came in and gets converted from

157
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
minus strand to plus strand.
And the plus strand can then do two

158
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
things.  It can get translated into
viral proteins,

159
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
both the glycoproteins that go
through the sorting pathway and make

160
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
it to the membrane,
as well as the structural proteins

161
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
that form the capsid.
The structural proteins then join up

162
00:12:38 --> 00:12:44
with the viral RNA segments,
now the minus strand RNA segments.

163
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
They meet at the membrane and then
bud off to form a new virus.

164
00:12:50 --> 00:12:55
OK?  So this is a standard
infectious cycle for this class of

165
00:12:55 --> 00:13:01
viruses.  And because it's going to
be relevant later,

166
00:13:01 --> 00:13:07
I just want to emphasize a couple of
points.

167
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
Through interactions between the
cytoplasmic tail of the envelope

168
00:13:11 --> 00:13:16
glycoprotiens,
the capsid proteins coalesce

169
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
underneath the plasma membrane.
And there's an interaction between

170
00:13:20 --> 00:13:25
these proteins and the tails of
these proteins which causes the

171
00:13:25 --> 00:13:30
virus to start to bud off the
surface of the cell.

172
00:13:30 --> 00:13:35
Now, there are separate interactions
with the proteins on the inside of

173
00:13:35 --> 00:13:40
the capsid which bring with them the
different viral RNA.

174
00:13:40 --> 00:13:46
So remember there are eight.
And there's a rather amazing

175
00:13:46 --> 00:13:51
process by which the eight distinct
RNA segments get brought together

176
00:13:51 --> 00:13:57
into the capsid,
and then the capsid goes to the

177
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
membrane and gets budded.
So there is a sorting process,

178
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
which we don't fully understand,
that ensures that viruses get at

179
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
least one copy of each of the
genomic segments.

180
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12.35
And that's necessary because if a
virus doesn't have all eight,

181
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15.88
when it gets into the host cell that
it might infect,

182
00:14:15 --> 00:14:19.41
it's not going to be able to
replicate.  These RNA segments

183
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
encode one, or at most two of the
viral proteins that are necessary

184
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
for the infectious cycle that's
drawn up there.

185
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
And you'll see why that's important
in a moment.

186
00:14:30 --> 00:14:35
OK.  So we get infected,
we develop antibodies against the

187
00:14:35 --> 00:14:40
proteins of the virus,
and we typically develop them

188
00:14:40 --> 00:14:45
against the glycoproteins that are
sitting on the outside.

189
00:14:45 --> 00:14:50
We develop T cells that can
recognize virus infected cells and

190
00:14:50 --> 00:14:55
kill them.  And yet we keep getting
flu.  So why is that?

191
00:14:55 --> 00:15:00
How is it that we can,
how is it that the virus can

192
00:15:00 --> 00:15:05
overcome this immune resistance?
And the answer is that the virus

193
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
changes.  And this is a major
problem with all viruses,

194
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
but it's a particular problem with
RNA viruses and a particular problem

195
00:15:13 --> 00:15:17
with flu.  So here's a depiction of
the virus again.

196
00:15:17 --> 00:15:21
It's got its genomic segments in
here.  And on the surface it has

197
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
these glycoproteins.
And I'm going to draw a little bit

198
00:15:25 --> 00:15:30
more detail in these
glycoproteins now.

199
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
There are actually two distinct
glycoproteins on the surface of the

200
00:15:35 --> 00:15:40
cell.  There's one that's called HA
and there's another that's called NA.

201
00:15:40 --> 00:15:46
And they carry out different
functions.  When you get infected,

202
00:15:46 --> 00:15:51
your immune system sees these
epitopes sitting on the surface of

203
00:15:51 --> 00:15:56
the virus and you make antibodies
against them.  And there are three

204
00:15:56 --> 00:16:02
particular places on these proteins
where good antibodies can be made

205
00:16:02 --> 00:16:08.5
inside your body.
One of them is here,

206
00:16:08 --> 00:16:15.5
another one is here, and a third one
is here.  And different people make

207
00:16:15 --> 00:16:31
different of these antibodies.

208
00:16:31 --> 00:16:37
And these antibodies that are made
have a name which is neutralizing or

209
00:16:37 --> 00:16:44
blocking antibodies.
They're called that because if you

210
00:16:44 --> 00:16:50
have one of these antibodies,
and it will bind to the surface of

211
00:16:50 --> 00:16:57
the viral particle,
this virus can now not infect the

212
00:16:57 --> 00:17:04
cell.  There's an interference
between the, what the hell?

213
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
Between the glycoproteins on the
surface and the receptors to which

214
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
they bind by the antibody.
So they block binding.  And if you

215
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
cannot bind you cannot infect.
And this is very efficient.  This

216
00:17:18 --> 00:17:23
works.  So that's how you can
overcome the infection to that

217
00:17:23 --> 00:17:28
particular virus.
The problem is that viruses change.

218
00:17:28 --> 00:17:33
During their replication there are
mutations.

219
00:17:33 --> 00:17:38
And sometimes these mutations affect
the structure of the proteins that

220
00:17:38 --> 00:17:43
are sitting on the surface.
So you might imagine the strain

221
00:17:43 --> 00:17:48
here gives rise to variant here
which has an HA protein which looks

222
00:17:48 --> 00:17:53
more or less the same,
but it has an NA protein which has

223
00:17:53 --> 00:17:59
changed.  So now this epitope,
which was recognized by antibody

224
00:17:59 --> 00:18:04
three, cannot be recognized by
antibody three because it's got a

225
00:18:04 --> 00:18:09
difference sequence.
OK?  If you were a person who made

226
00:18:09 --> 00:18:13
predominantly antibody three in
response to this infection,

227
00:18:13 --> 00:18:17
you would not be susceptible to this
virus.  So if this one came along

228
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
next year you'd get the flu.
If you were a person who made

229
00:18:21 --> 00:18:25
antibody one or antibody two as your
major protective antibody,

230
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
you'd still be resistant to this.
You'd be one of the lucky ones.

231
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
And because there's heterogeneity
within our population,

232
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
even if these new variants arise,
they don't spread all that much

233
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
because there are enough people in
the population who are pretty well

234
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
protected.  So those are low-level
spread or low-level epidemics.

235
00:18:46 --> 00:18:50
OK?  Now, this process, one day I'm
going to figure out how this works.

236
00:18:50 --> 00:18:57.5
This process of generating variant

237
00:18:57 --> 00:19:02.5
viruses through this mutational
mechanism is called

238
00:19:02 --> 00:19:12
antigenic drift.

239
00:19:12 --> 00:19:16
It's a slow drift of the antigens on
the virus.  And it happens because

240
00:19:16 --> 00:19:20.8
the virus is highly mutagenic.
And it's true of RNA viruses in

241
00:19:20 --> 00:19:33
general.

242
00:19:33 --> 00:19:38
And there are two reasons why RNA
viruses create variants at such high

243
00:19:38 --> 00:19:44
levels.  One is that RNA is less
stable than DNA.

244
00:19:44 --> 00:19:49
Remember, there's a difference in
the structure of RNA versus DNA.

245
00:19:49 --> 00:19:55
There's an extra hydroxyl in the
structure of RNA which can cause

246
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
increased mutation,
increased breaks and base

247
00:20:01 --> 00:20:07
substitutions in our RNA molecules
compared to DNA molecules.

248
00:20:07 --> 00:20:15
So RNA is inherently less stable
than DNA.  And also RNA polymerases

249
00:20:15 --> 00:20:25
lack proofreading functions.

250
00:20:25 --> 00:20:30
Which means they have an inherently
higher mutation rate.

251
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
And hopefully,
again, this is familiar from our

252
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
discussions about DNA replication.
All polymerases make mistakes but

253
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
your DNA polymerases have what's
called a proofreading function which

254
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
can recognize the mistakes and
correct them.  RNA polymerases lack

255
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
that, and so they make the mistakes
and they stay as mistakes.

256
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
So the mutation rates for RNA
polymerases are at least ten fold

257
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
higher than for DNA polymerases,
and in some places even higher still.

258
00:20:58 --> 00:21:02.25
OK.
So that's what's called antigenic

259
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06.75
shift, sorry, antigenic drift.
And it happens all the time and is

260
00:21:06 --> 00:21:11.25
responsible for why we keep getting
mild cases of the flu.

261
00:21:11 --> 00:21:15.75
But that's not what's responsible
for the Spanish flu of 1918.

262
00:21:15 --> 00:21:23
Instead of antigenic drift --

263
00:21:23 --> 00:21:27
-- these are due to a phenomenon
called antigenic shift.

264
00:21:27 --> 00:21:31
Rather than generating subtly
different variants,

265
00:21:31 --> 00:21:35
like I've shown up here,
this is the process of generating

266
00:21:35 --> 00:21:47
essentially entirely new strains.

267
00:21:47 --> 00:21:50
And it happens in the case of flu
all the time.  And one of the

268
00:21:50 --> 00:21:54
reasons that it happens is that
there are lots and lots of types of

269
00:21:54 --> 00:21:58
flu viruses which are kind of
similar that infect other species.

270
00:21:58 --> 00:22:02
There are duck flus,
swine flus, horse flus,

271
00:22:02 --> 00:22:07
seal flus that are all caused by
versions of this influenza A virus.

272
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
Similar.  Not identical but similar.
And sometimes those viruses cross

273
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
over into the human population.
And this is an example of a

274
00:22:17 --> 00:22:35
zoonotic infection --

275
00:22:35 --> 00:22:38
-- which is an infection from
another species into the human

276
00:22:38 --> 00:22:41
population.  And actually happens
all the time.  Many of the new

277
00:22:41 --> 00:22:44
pathogens that arise in the human
population arise through zoonotic

278
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
infection.  Now,
most viruses that are evolved to

279
00:22:47 --> 00:22:50
grow in the cells of one given
species, at the temperature of a

280
00:22:50 --> 00:22:54
given species,
will not replicate very well inside

281
00:22:54 --> 00:22:57
human cells.  So even if they did
infect, they wouldn't reproduce

282
00:22:57 --> 00:23:01
themselves very well.
And that would be true of these

283
00:23:01 --> 00:23:06
viruses, too, swine flu virus,
bird flu viruses.  The problem is,

284
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
in the case of flu, the human virus
is so common and the mechanism of

285
00:23:10 --> 00:23:15
replication of this virus is so
complex and amenable to generation

286
00:23:15 --> 00:23:20.46
of recombinant viruses that we can
generate new viral forms.

287
00:23:20 --> 00:23:25.23
And that's what I want to talk to
you about now.

288
00:23:25 --> 00:23:30
So here's an example from not too
long ago.

289
00:23:30 --> 00:23:34
This is the collection and culling
of a lot of birds somewhere in Asia.

290
00:23:34 --> 00:23:39
I'm not really sure where this was.
But there was a concern that a new

291
00:23:39 --> 00:23:44
virus was developing in a bird
population and was crossing over

292
00:23:44 --> 00:23:49
into humans.  And it caused some
deaths.  And so to avoid that

293
00:23:49 --> 00:23:54
further they just wiped out some
millions of these birds in order to

294
00:23:54 --> 00:23:59
prevent further cross infection.
But, again, it's not the presence of

295
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
the virus, the bird virus or swine
virus itself that's the problem.

296
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
It's the fact that the two viruses,
the human virus and the bird virus

297
00:24:08 --> 00:24:13
can recombine to form a dangerous
new virus which is rather similar to

298
00:24:13 --> 00:24:18
the human virus but carries some
segments of the bird virus.

299
00:24:18 --> 00:24:22
And that's illustrated here,
and I'll show you on the board in a

300
00:24:22 --> 00:24:27
second.  But basically the idea is
that a human virus carrying its

301
00:24:27 --> 00:24:32
eight segments,
including the segment for HA and NA

302
00:24:32 --> 00:24:37
infects an animal which also gets
infected by a bird virus.

303
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
So that in the same cell there are
the segments for the human virus,

304
00:24:41 --> 00:24:45
as well as the segments for the bird
virus.  And during this process of

305
00:24:45 --> 00:24:49
the generation of a new viral
particle, you can get mixing of the

306
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
segments so that most of the
segments come from the human virus

307
00:24:53 --> 00:24:57
and, therefore,
will replicate well in the context

308
00:24:57 --> 00:25:02
of the human cell.
But two new segments come in from

309
00:25:02 --> 00:25:08
the bird that encode its HA and NA,
a version that's never been seen in

310
00:25:08 --> 00:25:13
the human population.
Nobody has antibodies against it so

311
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
the virus can spread like wildfire.
And that's what we believe happened

312
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
then and we fear continues to happen
over time.  So,

313
00:25:24 --> 00:25:29
again, imagine a cell which has been
infected by two different viruses,

314
00:25:29 --> 00:25:35
the avian virus, in this case it was
a duck, as well as the human virus

315
00:25:35 --> 00:25:41
in that given year.
In that cell there are going to be

316
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
lots of different segments of virus
RNA, the human ones H1,

317
00:25:47 --> 00:25:53
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and so on,
as well as the duck ones, duck 1,

318
00:25:53 --> 00:25:59
duck 2 and so on and so forth, duck
7 and duck 8.

319
00:25:59 --> 00:26:05
When the viral capsids coalesce
underneath the viral glycoproteins

320
00:26:05 --> 00:26:12
to produce a new virus,
they cannot necessarily distinguish

321
00:26:12 --> 00:26:19
between the human and the duck
subunits.  So there might be human 1,

322
00:26:19 --> 00:26:26
human 2, human 3,
duck 4, human 5, duck 6,

323
00:26:26 --> 00:26:32
human 7 and human 8.
OK?  This then makes a virus which

324
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
is perfectly able to replicate in
human cells because it's got mostly

325
00:26:36 --> 00:26:40
the genes that are optimized for
human cells, but it's got new HA and

326
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
NA forms that have never been seen
by the human population.

327
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
So there is nobody who has
antibodies against it.

328
00:26:49 --> 00:26:53
So the virus will spread like crazy.
OK?  So this is an example of

329
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57
antigenic shift,
and it's responsible for these

330
00:26:57 --> 00:27:01
worldwide pandemics.
OK.  Any questions about flu?

331
00:27:01 --> 00:27:05
One thing I failed to mention,
sort of trivial but you probably

332
00:27:05 --> 00:27:09
know, is it spread very well because
it can spread in water droplets.

333
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
If you sneeze on your friends
they'll also get the flu.

334
00:27:13 --> 00:27:17
It's a very efficient virus so you
don't need very many viral particles

335
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
to go inside of your respiratory
system in order to initiate the

336
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
infection.  And this is another good
example.  When you have a very

337
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
active infection inside of you,
you start producing lots of the

338
00:27:29 --> 00:27:33
cytokines, that I mentioned last
time, like interferons.

339
00:27:33 --> 00:27:37
And, again, it's largely those that
are causing the symptoms of the flu,

340
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
and in large enough quantities can
cause death.  You can also get

341
00:27:41 --> 00:27:45
secondary infections with bacteria
when you're that sick,

342
00:27:45 --> 00:27:49
which can be another reason why
folks die.  OK.

343
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
So if there are no other questions
about flu, we'll now turn our

344
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
attention to HIV.
And I think HIV is probably fairly

345
00:27:57 --> 00:28:02
familiar as a topic.
It's, of course,

346
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
a major, major worldwide health
problem.  The initiation of this

347
00:28:08 --> 00:28:18
epidemic goes back a very long way.

348
00:28:18 --> 00:28:24
The first cases were reported in
1975, so about 30 years ago.

349
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
And so that's considered to be the
initiation of this epidemic

350
00:28:30 --> 00:28:35
or pandemic.
The first case in the United States

351
00:28:35 --> 00:28:39
is considered to have occurred in
1980.  And here's another example.

352
00:28:39 --> 00:28:43
We think that this probably
occurred by one of the

353
00:28:43 --> 00:28:51
zoonotic infections.

354
00:28:51 --> 00:28:55
But it happened a long time ago.
It happened at least before 1950

355
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59
because there are samples of
individuals who died of unknown

356
00:28:59 --> 00:29:03
causes that have now been tested and
can be shown to have HIV

357
00:29:03 --> 00:29:08
sequences by PCR.
So whenever this happened,

358
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
and from whatever species it
happened, it happened quite a while

359
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
ago.  Why it then initiated in this
epidemic form much later is not so

360
00:29:17 --> 00:29:26
clear.  The etiological agent --

361
00:29:26 --> 00:29:33
-- is a virus called HIV,
human immunodeficiency virus.

362
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
It is a retro virus.
And we'll briefly review how it

363
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
replicated, but I told you more or
less how that happens last time.

364
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
And this was another good example.
The syndrome was first discovered

365
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
in 1975, gained a lot of attention
in this country starting in the

366
00:29:50 --> 00:29:55
early 1980s, and the virus was first
purified and characterized in 1983.

367
00:29:55 --> 00:29:59
So it didn't take too long to
identify the agent and then

368
00:29:59 --> 00:30:04
ultimately sequence its genome.
And also to develop tests for the

369
00:30:04 --> 00:30:10
presence of actually not the virus
itself.  The AIDS test is a test for

370
00:30:10 --> 00:30:15
the presence of antibodies in you
that recognize the viral

371
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
glycoproteins.
And this was very important,

372
00:30:21 --> 00:30:27
obviously, in screening populations,
screening blood banks and so on for

373
00:30:27 --> 00:30:32
contaminated samples.
Now, since this time,

374
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
in the early 1980s, the situation
has, of course,

375
00:30:36 --> 00:30:40
gotten much, much worse.
In this country, there are

376
00:30:40 --> 00:30:52
currently --

377
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
-- a million people infected with
HIV.  That's between,

378
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
you know, one and 300 individuals
total.

379
00:31:00 --> 00:31:08
And, amazingly,
about 20% of those people don't know

380
00:31:08 --> 00:31:16
it.  Worldwide,
anybody have any idea how many

381
00:31:16 --> 00:31:24
people are infected with HIV in the
world?  40 million.

382
00:31:24 --> 00:31:32
And total about 60 million people
have been infected because since the

383
00:31:32 --> 00:31:40
early 1980s, 20 million people have
died from this disease.

384
00:31:40 --> 00:31:45.75
More than 20 million.
And the prevalence is remarkable in

385
00:31:45 --> 00:31:51.5
certain places in the world.
In Southern Africa, for example,

386
00:31:51 --> 00:31:57.25
not the country of South Africa but
in the Southern Region of Africa,

387
00:31:57 --> 00:32:03
Saharan Africa, there are 25 million
people infected.

388
00:32:03 --> 00:32:08.5
And in certain countries that's one
in four sexually active individuals.

389
00:32:08 --> 00:32:14
Remarkable infection rates.  And
the effect of this disease and the

390
00:32:14 --> 00:32:19.5
death that it causes has also had
dramatic effects on the population.

391
00:32:19 --> 00:32:25
So that in Zimbabwe, for example,
where the life expectancy in 1990

392
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30.5
was 52 years old,
not a huge number but 52 years old,

393
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
in 2003, because of AIDS, it's less
then 35 years.

394
00:32:36 --> 00:32:42
So it has dramatically affected the
lives of people throughout the world.

395
00:32:42 --> 00:32:48
OK.  And, as you know,
I suspect you know that transmission

396
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
for this virus occurs through direct
contact of contaminated fluids.

397
00:32:54 --> 00:33:00
Sexual contact, which is both
homosexual and heterosexual.

398
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
As well as blood transfusion,
direct blood contact, through

399
00:33:04 --> 00:33:09
transfusion, and also needle sharing.
And sometimes occasionally organ

400
00:33:09 --> 00:33:14
donation, but that's very,
very rare.  OK.

401
00:33:14 --> 00:33:21.75
So people die from AIDS because they

402
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25.25
develop infections.
And we'll talk a bit more about

403
00:33:25 --> 00:33:28.75
that in a moment.
But here's one patient who has

404
00:33:28 --> 00:33:32.25
developed an infection with a virus,
a particular type of herpes virus

405
00:33:32 --> 00:33:36
now called Kaposi's sarcoma virus.
That virus then is able to replicate

406
00:33:36 --> 00:33:40
in certain cells of the blood
vasculature and cause tumors.

407
00:33:40 --> 00:33:44
These are actually tumors.  And
this individual will die from a

408
00:33:44 --> 00:33:48
disease called Kaposi's sarcoma,
a type of cancer, another example of

409
00:33:48 --> 00:33:52
a virus-associated cancer of humans.
And in this country AIDS, as you

410
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
probably know,
has taken over as the leading killer

411
00:33:56 --> 00:34:01
of young male adults.
It was not known in the early 1980s,

412
00:34:01 --> 00:34:06
and by 1992, just ten years later
had become the major killer of young

413
00:34:06 --> 00:34:10
male adults in this country.
And, of course, likewise around the

414
00:34:10 --> 00:34:15
world.  So here's the virus.
As I said, it's a retrovirus.

415
00:34:15 --> 00:34:20
Retroviruses also are enveloped.
They have glycoproteins on the

416
00:34:20 --> 00:34:25
outside, envelope glycoproteins.
They have a capsid like all viruses

417
00:34:25 --> 00:34:30
do.  They have a genome.
The genome is made of RNA.

418
00:34:30 --> 00:34:34
And, as you know,
through the retroviral lifecycle,

419
00:34:34 --> 00:34:38
the RNA is converted into a DNA form.
We'll go over that next time.

420
00:34:38 --> 00:34:42
And that's accomplished by an
enzyme called reverse transcriptase

421
00:34:42 --> 00:34:46
which gets prepackaged with the
virus.  Again,

422
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
it has to be there because your
cells don't have an RNA dependent

423
00:34:50 --> 00:34:54
RNA polymerase.
So this gets prepackaged.

424
00:34:54 --> 00:34:58
The virus then infects cells.
And this, again, is a somewhat

425
00:34:58 --> 00:35:01
oversimplification.
I'll show you more details in a

426
00:35:01 --> 00:35:05
second.  But the virus attaches via
glycoproteins on its surface,

427
00:35:05 --> 00:35:08
membrane proteins on the surface of
the host cell.

428
00:35:08 --> 00:35:12
In this case it's a familiar
protein to you called CD4.

429
00:35:12 --> 00:35:15
That leads to a fusion event.
So now at the plasma membrane,

430
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
which is different from what we saw
with flu virus which happened in an

431
00:35:19 --> 00:35:22
internal membrane,
at the plasma membrane there's a

432
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
fusion event.  So now the viral
membrane fuses with the host cell

433
00:35:26 --> 00:35:30
membrane and the viral capsid can
lead into the cytoplasm.

434
00:35:30 --> 00:35:33
There's a little bit of unpackaging
that goes on.  And then reverse

435
00:35:33 --> 00:35:36
transcriptase,
that enzyme that got prepackaged

436
00:35:36 --> 00:35:39
there acts on the viral genome,
which is made of RNA and converts it

437
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
to a DNA form,
a double-stranded DNA form which is

438
00:35:43 --> 00:35:46
called a provirus.
And that provirus then gets

439
00:35:46 --> 00:35:49
integrated into the host cell genome
in a random process,

440
00:35:49 --> 00:35:53
random integration, the host cell
genome.  This is also accomplished

441
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
by a pre-packed enzyme called
integrase.  Once in the genome it

442
00:35:56 --> 00:36:00
gets treated like any
old piece of DNA.

443
00:36:00 --> 00:36:03
It gets transcribed into actually
multiple different RNAs.

444
00:36:03 --> 00:36:07
They get translated into viral
proteins which come together at the

445
00:36:07 --> 00:36:10
plasma membrane and the
glycoproteins,

446
00:36:10 --> 00:36:14
the capsid proteins which
incorporate the genome,

447
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
plus the reverse transcriptase,
and you make a new particle.  OK?

448
00:36:18 --> 00:36:21
So this is more or less the
lifecycle.  There is some detail

449
00:36:21 --> 00:36:25
that I want to share with you in a
moment because it's interesting.

450
00:36:25 --> 00:36:29
This is what it looks like in real
life.

451
00:36:29 --> 00:36:33
These are HIV particles budding off
the surface of an infected cell.

452
00:36:33 --> 00:36:37
They have a very characteristic
electron dense structure.

453
00:36:37 --> 00:36:41
You can actually tell it is HIV
from just the way it looks in the

454
00:36:41 --> 00:36:45
electron microscope.
And this is an HIV infected T cell.

455
00:36:45 --> 00:36:49
Now, CD4 should have rung a bell
that it's one of the proteins on the

456
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
surface of helper T cells,
CD4 positive T cells.  That is a

457
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
major cell of infection for HIV.
And here is one such cell infected.

458
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
And all these little blebs budding
off the surface of this cell are

459
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
viruses getting out.
This process actually doesn't

460
00:37:06 --> 00:37:11
itself, the budding process doesn't
itself kill the T cell but,

461
00:37:11 --> 00:37:15
nevertheless, T cells, this class of
T cells dies.  And,

462
00:37:15 --> 00:37:20
actually, that's a critical event in
the development of HIV-AIDS,

463
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
the disease.  We'll come to that in
a second, but let me first tell you

464
00:37:24 --> 00:37:44
one of the interesting details.

465
00:37:44 --> 00:37:48
The situation is a little more
complicated than the figure that I

466
00:37:48 --> 00:37:52
gave you on that slide.
There are two glycoproteins on the

467
00:37:52 --> 00:37:56
surface of HIV.
One of them is called GP120 for

468
00:37:56 --> 00:38:02
glycoprotein 120.
It's linked by a disulfide linkage

469
00:38:02 --> 00:38:08
to another protein called GP41.
And we now know that both of these

470
00:38:08 --> 00:38:14
proteins participate in binding and
fusion.  And on the surface of the

471
00:38:14 --> 00:38:20
infected cell is CD4,
as was indicated on that slide.

472
00:38:20 --> 00:38:26
And that is the major viral
receptor that is present on helper T

473
00:38:26 --> 00:38:33
cells, CD4 positive T cells.
It's also present on macrophages.

474
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37.5
As well as certain cells in the
brain called glial cells.

475
00:38:37 --> 00:38:42
So there are CD4 positive
macrophages and glial cells.

476
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46.5
AIDS-associated dementia, which you
may know about,

477
00:38:46 --> 00:38:51
is caused by the destruction of the
glial cells in the brain.

478
00:38:51 --> 00:38:55.5
Now, there's another protein which
participates, not so much in the

479
00:38:55 --> 00:39:00
binding but in the fusion event that
allows the virus to get in.

480
00:39:00 --> 00:39:02
And this is actually a class of
proteins called chemokine

481
00:39:02 --> 00:39:10
receptors.

482
00:39:10 --> 00:39:13
There are actually multiple
chemokine receptors on your cells.

483
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
And, in fact, different HIV forms
bind to different of these.

484
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
But just to simplify, let's say
that there is one of these which

485
00:39:20 --> 00:39:24
binds to the GP41 portion.
And it's that binding that allows

486
00:39:24 --> 00:39:28
the virus to fuse.
If you don't have this you cannot

487
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
fuse.
And, therefore,

488
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
the cells are not infected.
What's interesting about that is

489
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40
two-fold.  One,
it could represent a therapeutic

490
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
target.  That interaction could be a
therapeutic target.

491
00:39:44 --> 00:39:49
But it came to light in an
interesting way which was there are

492
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
people who have been followed a long
time who lived in high-risk

493
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
populations, drug-users or
homosexual men with multiple

494
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
contacts with known HIV infected
people who have not themselves

495
00:40:01 --> 00:40:06
gotten HIV.
They seem to be naturally resistant

496
00:40:06 --> 00:40:11
to the development of HIV,
despite documented exposure to the

497
00:40:11 --> 00:40:17
virus.  And they were studied.
And when that observation was made

498
00:40:17 --> 00:40:22
it was found that these individuals
lack the chemokine receptor.

499
00:40:22 --> 00:40:27
And if you lack the chemokine
receptor, you may have CD4 on the

500
00:40:27 --> 00:40:33
surface of your cells but you don't
have that critical co-receptor.

501
00:40:33 --> 00:40:39
And so there can be binding but no
fusion.  So your cells are resistant.

502
00:40:39 --> 00:40:45
So these individuals are naturally
resistant to HIV.  OK.

503
00:40:45 --> 00:40:58
So HIV infects.

504
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
It infects a lot of T cells,
helper T cells and other cells in

505
00:41:02 --> 00:41:05
the body.  Why do you get sick?
Well, as I mentioned, people get

506
00:41:05 --> 00:41:09
sick because of the loss,
the absence --

507
00:41:09 --> 00:41:19
During infection,

508
00:41:19 --> 00:41:23
the CD4 positive T cells get
eliminated.  How exactly they get

509
00:41:23 --> 00:41:27
eliminated, why exactly they get
eliminated we don't yet know,

510
00:41:27 --> 00:41:31
but we know that the levels of these
cells goes down inside the

511
00:41:31 --> 00:41:35.5
infected individual.
And, as you probably remember,

512
00:41:35 --> 00:41:45
CD4 positive T cells --

513
00:41:45 --> 00:41:48
-- are required for the development
of these cells.

514
00:41:48 --> 00:41:55
So if you don't have CD4 positive T

515
00:41:55 --> 00:41:57
cells you cannot make antibody
producing cells.

516
00:41:57 --> 00:42:00
You cannot make functional
antibodies.

517
00:42:00 --> 00:42:05
And, to some extent,
they're also required for the

518
00:42:05 --> 00:42:10
development of cytotoxic T cells.
So that part of the immune system

519
00:42:10 --> 00:42:15
is also compromised.
So the virus wipes out these cells

520
00:42:15 --> 00:42:20
and, therefore,
the immune system crashes.

521
00:42:20 --> 00:42:26
And that's why it's called AIDS for
acquired immunodeficiency.

522
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
Acquired because it comes through an

523
00:42:32 --> 00:42:36
infectious agent.
Immunodeficiency because your

524
00:42:36 --> 00:42:40
immune system crashes.
And when your immune system crashes

525
00:42:40 --> 00:42:44
you cannot fight infections.
And AIDS patients largely die

526
00:42:44 --> 00:42:48
because they get one or another type
of infection.

527
00:42:48 --> 00:42:54.75
So this is a graph which shows the

528
00:42:54 --> 00:42:58.25
time course of HIV infection.
And it kind of makes the point that

529
00:42:58 --> 00:43:01
T cells go away.
Shortly after you are infected,

530
00:43:01 --> 00:43:04
the level of HIV in your blood goes
way, way up, as you can see here.

531
00:43:04 --> 00:43:08
It spikes in the first several
months after your infection.

532
00:43:08 --> 00:43:11
Some people actually manifest that
aspect of the disease.

533
00:43:11 --> 00:43:14
Many don't so they don't know that
they have such a high concentration

534
00:43:14 --> 00:43:17
of virus.  And,
importantly, your body deals with it

535
00:43:17 --> 00:43:20
so you make antibodies,
in black.  You make anti-HIV

536
00:43:20 --> 00:43:24
antibodies.  And,
remember, it's these that are

537
00:43:24 --> 00:43:27
detected by the AIDS test.
If you've been exposed then you

538
00:43:27 --> 00:43:31
make antibodies.
And they stick around so that you

539
00:43:31 --> 00:43:35
know that you've been infected.
Likewise, T cells, cytotoxic T

540
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
cells, CD8 positive T cells go up.
And that controls the level of the

541
00:43:40 --> 00:43:45
virus.  And it stays low for a while,
but after a while,

542
00:43:45 --> 00:43:49
because of the affects on the CD4
positive T cells,

543
00:43:49 --> 00:43:54
the other cells in the immune system
are no longer sustained so the B

544
00:43:54 --> 00:43:59
cells start to drop off and the T
cells start to drop off.

545
00:43:59 --> 00:44:02
And now you're starting to lose the
battle against the HIV,

546
00:44:02 --> 00:44:06
so the levels of HIV go up.
And as they go up, you lose more

547
00:44:06 --> 00:44:09
CD4 positive T cells and the
situation gets worse and worse.

548
00:44:09 --> 00:44:13
So after a while, usually in the
several years out time point,

549
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
your immune system is now no longer
functional and you're very

550
00:44:17 --> 00:44:20
susceptible to opportunistic
infections.  So AIDS patients will

551
00:44:20 --> 00:44:24
develop infections,
and the infections will progress in

552
00:44:24 --> 00:44:28
a way that won't happen
in a healthy person.

553
00:44:28 --> 00:44:32
Certain bacterial infections that
you would clearly very easily take

554
00:44:32 --> 00:44:37
hold and can cause major problems.
Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by

555
00:44:37 --> 00:44:42
infection of this particular virus.
AIDS patients are very susceptible

556
00:44:42 --> 00:44:47
to tuberculosis,
this particular fungal infection,

557
00:44:47 --> 00:44:51
certain other viral infections.  And
in aggregate, the exposure to these

558
00:44:51 --> 00:44:56
various infectious agents and the
damage that they're causing leads to

559
00:44:56 --> 00:45:01
the death of the patient.  OK.
So that's bad news.

560
00:45:01 --> 00:45:06
And obviously it's have major and
devastating consequences around the

561
00:45:06 --> 00:45:11
world.  So what can we do about it?
Well, there is some good news here.

562
00:45:11 --> 00:45:33
There are antiviral therapies.

563
00:45:33 --> 00:45:44
Remember that viruses largely use

564
00:45:44 --> 00:45:48
your enzymes.  And you cannot make
good drugs against your own enzymes

565
00:45:48 --> 00:45:52
for treatment of a viral disease,
but I've told you about one viral

566
00:45:52 --> 00:45:56
protein to which you might be able
to make drugs.  And

567
00:45:56 --> 00:46:04
indeed we have.

568
00:46:04 --> 00:46:10
HIV has an RNA genome that gets
converted to a DNA form by an enzyme

569
00:46:10 --> 00:46:17
reverse transcriptase.
There have been drugs produced that

570
00:46:17 --> 00:46:23
block that enzyme.
And you've probably heard of the

571
00:46:23 --> 00:46:29
drug AZT.
There are other drugs like

572
00:46:29 --> 00:46:33
dideoxyinosine and dideoxycytosine
that likewise bind to and block the

573
00:46:33 --> 00:46:37
activity of this enzyme.
They actually cause chain

574
00:46:37 --> 00:46:42
termination in the same way that DNA
sequencing works.

575
00:46:42 --> 00:46:46
And they work because this enzyme
is sensitive to these drugs at

576
00:46:46 --> 00:46:51
concentrations where your
polymerases are not,

577
00:46:51 --> 00:46:55
so that gives you some selected
effect in the treatment of the virus.

578
00:46:55 --> 00:47:00
And these agents,
when used singly, work for a while.

579
00:47:00 --> 00:47:04
And then the virus becomes resistant
and comes roaring back.

580
00:47:04 --> 00:47:08
How does it become resistant?
It becomes resistant through

581
00:47:08 --> 00:47:13
mutation, exactly the way cancer
cells become resistant to targeted

582
00:47:13 --> 00:47:17
therapies.  Variant forms of HIV
arise which have slightly altered

583
00:47:17 --> 00:47:22
reverse transcriptases that now
won't bind to AZT or DDI or DDC.

584
00:47:22 --> 00:47:26
And the problem is very, very
serious because viruses,

585
00:47:26 --> 00:47:31
RNA viruses in particular are highly
mutagenic.

586
00:47:31 --> 00:47:36
They create variant forms at high
frequency.  An HIV infected person

587
00:47:36 --> 00:47:41
makes ten to the tenth viral
particles a day.

588
00:47:41 --> 00:47:46
At a mutation rate of ten to the
minus fifth, that would mean ten to

589
00:47:46 --> 00:47:52
the fifth variants of every
nucleotide.  OK?

590
00:47:52 --> 00:47:57
So variants come up frequently that
are resistant to this

591
00:47:57 --> 00:48:14
therapy.  Oops.

592
00:48:14 --> 00:48:24
Fortunately, there are alternatives.
The viral RNA gets translated into

593
00:48:24 --> 00:48:40
a large polyprotein --

594
00:48:40 --> 00:48:44
-- which is processed by a viral
protease encoded by the virus into

595
00:48:44 --> 00:48:48
different mature proteins.
Reverse transcriptase is one of

596
00:48:48 --> 00:48:53
them.  The integrase that I
mentioned is another.

597
00:48:53 --> 00:48:57
And there are others.
This is a viral protein,

598
00:48:57 --> 00:49:02
a viral enzyme.
And so, in theory,

599
00:49:02 --> 00:49:06
it's possible to make inhibitors
against the protease.

600
00:49:06 --> 00:49:11
And that's been successful.
Several companies have made

601
00:49:11 --> 00:49:15
inhibitors that will specifically
inhibit the viral protease that work

602
00:49:15 --> 00:49:20
well.  They work for a while and
then resistant forms arise for

603
00:49:20 --> 00:49:24
exactly the same reason I said.
You can create versions of protease

604
00:49:24 --> 00:49:29
which still work but won't bind the
drug.  OK?  So what do you do?

605
00:49:29 --> 00:49:34
Does anybody know what you do to
overcome this problem?

606
00:49:34 --> 00:49:46
You put the drugs together.

607
00:49:46 --> 00:49:54
So currently HIV patients,

608
00:49:54 --> 00:49:58
in this country anyway, and
hopefully soon around the world will

609
00:49:58 --> 00:50:02
get triple therapy when
they're diagnosed.

610
00:50:02 --> 00:50:08
And triple therapy includes two
reverse transcriptase inhibitors and

611
00:50:08 --> 00:50:18
one protease inhibitor.

612
00:50:18 --> 00:50:22
Since the development of resistance
against each of these agents is

613
00:50:22 --> 00:50:26
independent of the other,
to get resistance to all three is

614
00:50:26 --> 00:50:30
the product of the individual
frequency.

615
00:50:30 --> 00:50:35
So I said that the frequency of
developing resistance to any one is

616
00:50:35 --> 00:50:40
ten to the minus fifth.
To be resistant to all three would

617
00:50:40 --> 00:50:45
occur at ten to the minus fifteenth,
which is highly, highly unlikely.

618
00:50:45 --> 00:50:50
And so people tend not to develop
resistance to all three and,

619
00:50:50 --> 00:50:55
therefore, triple therapy tends to
keep the virus in-check for

620
00:50:55 --> 00:51:00
sustained periods of time.
As you probably know, this works.

621
00:51:00 --> 00:51:03.75
The fear is that it is starting not
to work.  And there are starting to

622
00:51:03 --> 00:51:07.5
be some resistant forms developing
here and they are starting to make

623
00:51:07 --> 00:51:11.25
their way into the population,
so we're going to have to develop

624
00:51:11 --> 00:51:15
even better and more different
inhibitors to now combat these

625
00:51:15 --> 00:51:18.75
variant forms.
Before I let you go,

626
00:51:18 --> 00:51:22.5
the last thing I wanted to mention,
and I'll just throw it out there and

627
00:51:22 --> 00:51:26.25
you can think about it,
is that what we'd really like to

628
00:51:26 --> 00:51:30
return to for HIV is what
we can do for polio.

629
00:51:30 --> 00:51:34.5
We'd like to be able to treat people
routinely in this country or out in

630
00:51:34 --> 00:51:39
the field in more distant regions
with an effective vaccine,

631
00:51:39 --> 00:51:43.5
which isn't possible today.
We don't have one for HIV.  You

632
00:51:43 --> 00:51:48
might think about what you would do
to make one and why it has been so

633
00:51:48 --> 00:51:51
hard.  And I'll touch
on that next time.
