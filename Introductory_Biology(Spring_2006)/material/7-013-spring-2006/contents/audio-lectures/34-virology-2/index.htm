<p> </p>
<p>OK. I think we'll get started.</p> <p>So we're going to continue our discussion today about viruses, finish  talking about influenza, influenza A virus and the flu, and then talk a  bit about HIV and AIDS.</p> <p>Do you guys know more about the tutorial session and so on and so forth for next week? Has that been decided yet? OK.</p> <p>So you'll get more information Monday and Wednesday. And I'll also  have an office hour, probably a couple of office hours at the end of  next week.</p> <p>Most likely, if it doesn't conflict with this tutorial session that's  being planned, it will be during this hour from 11:00 probably until  1:00 in this room because it's free since we're usually here.</p> <p>But that may conflict with you guys so we'll have to see. I'll let you know on Monday.</p> <p>So, again, the situation with viruses is an ongoing one. And,  actually, one of you brought to my attention an outbreak of polio that's  happening now both in Africa and Indonesia.</p> <p>This is actually from today's CNN.com where there's a fear that polio  is starting to spread. In this case in Jakarta, in Indonesia. And  there's a very extensive reaction to this. There's a great fear that  polio will spread.</p> <p>This is an area that is not well protected currently by polio vaccination.</p> <p>And so if you look at this you'll see that they are raising lots of  money in order to try to vaccinate with standard polio vaccines, which  work extremely well, 5.2 million children, to try to stop the spread of  this potential epidemic of polio.</p> <p>It hasn't reached anything near those levels to be that concerned,  but in order to protect against that possibility they're going to  vaccinate.</p> <p>And, obviously, if you vaccinate, individuals cannot be successfully infected.</p> <p>If they cannot be successfully infected, the virus cannot propagate  so they cannot pass it on. So you just close off the infectious cycle in  a very small circle of infected individuals. Also, in today's Globe,  there was a discussion of a local company that makes vaccines against  smallpox.</p> <p>And I've mentioned to you that smallpox is largely eliminated, if not  fully eliminated in the world, but there are stocks of smallpox in  freezers around the world.</p> <p>And there is a concern that an individual could access smallpox virus  or make one because the relevant sequences of the genome of the  smallpox virus is known.</p> <p>And so, in theory, you could synthesize your own smallpox virus  genome, and thereby create your own smallpox virus and expose now  unprotected individuals because we don't get vaccinated currently  against smallpox.</p> <p>And so there are companies like this one that are making currently and distributing smallpox vaccines.</p> <p>They distributed 182 million doses in this country alone just in case somebody tried to deliberately release some smallpox.</p> <p>So that's what we can do when we know what we're dealing with. We can  create effective vaccines. In this case they're effective, but  sometimes we get exposed to stuff that we cannot effectively deal with.</p> <p>And I introduced this to you last time.</p> <p>This was the major flu pandemic from 1918. Some people worried that  there might be another pandemic this year because in the off season  between 1918 and 1919 when this happened, and 20 to 40 million people  died, that's when the Red Sox last won the World Series.</p> <p>[LAUGHTER] So the Armageddon folks thought maybe this was the year,  but so far so good. So, as I mentioned last time, this was a major  outbreak and a major problem worldwide.</p> <p>But you also should know that influenza is an annual problem.</p> <p>And I, for one, didn't appreciate this.</p> <p>Where there are about 25 thousand deaths per year in the United  States. And, of course, to deal with that we make available, especially  to the elderly and infirmed immunodeficient flu shots.</p> <p>And flu shots are simply flu vaccines.</p> <p>And I'll tell you a little bit about how they're made towards the end  of this section, but they're generally effective in combating against  the flu that is going to hit the population that year. And they change  every year because, as you'll see, flu changes all the time as well.</p> <p>So it's an annual problem. There are occasional epidemics which you could think of as --</p> <p>-- population-based infection where many individuals within a  particular population are infected. And the virus, in this case, is  spreading throughout that population.</p> <p>And there are even more occasional pandemics. And that's a worldwide infection.</p> <p>Where, because of the virulence of the virus and its ability to  access different populations and the absence of immunity throughout the  worldwide population, lots and lots of people get infected.</p> <p>And that's what happened in 1918. So how do we explain this? How do  we explain the occasional epidemics of a virus that we're so familiar  with? Flu, as I said, we get every year, lots of people get it every  year.</p> <p>And, yet, we seem to be susceptible year after year.</p> <p>So why is that? What causes the resistance to this immunity in small  measure and in large measure? And that's what I want to review for you  today. So this is the responsible agent. It's a virus, of course.</p> <p>More specifically, it's an enveloped virus, which means it has its own lipid bilayer that it picked up from the host cell.</p> <p>And you'll notice on the outside are things sticking out of the  bilayer. These are proteins encoded by the virus which are going to be  responsible for binding the virus to the host cell.</p> <p>And also allowing the viral membrane to fuse with the host cell  membrane. And you'll see that that's done in the case of flu virus in a  slightly different way than for some other viruses. And then inside you  have the capsid.</p> <p>And wrapped up in this protein, this helical protein structure are the nucleic acids of the virus.</p> <p>And the nucleic acids of this virus are multiple. That is it's not just one. Oops. It's not just one.</p> <p>It's actually several.</p> <p>So, again, it's called influenza A virus. It's an example of an enveloped virus.</p> <p>And I said you should note the envelope proteins, which are largely encoded by the virus itself.</p> <p>And we call these envelope glycoproteins. Glycoproteins because when  they emerge through the sorting pathway of the cell they pick up sugars.  And so when they're on the outside of the cell, it's not just protein.</p> <p>There is some sugar there, so glycoproteins. And sometimes the  antibodies that we make are directed against the sugar moieties alone or  in combination with peptides.</p> <p>So the envelope glycoproteins are important.</p> <p>As I said, it's a segmented RNA genome, which means that there are  multiple distinct nucleic acids in the viral particle. And in the case  of flu there are eight.</p> <p>The RNA genome is single-stranded.</p> <p>And all of the genome segments are in the minus configuration. So  their sequence is the complement to the mRNA. OK? And we talked about  the significance of RNA viruses that have a minus strand polarity in the  sense that they need to have their own RNA polymerase coming in with  the virus in order to help, in order to initiate the replication cycle.</p> <p>So, hopefully, that's familiar from last time.</p> <p>This is a diagram of the virus, and it just makes the same points I  just made. So, again, it has a lipid bilayer. It has envelope  glycoproteins sticking out from the surface. You'll see that they're  important for different things in a moment.</p> <p>Inside that is a nucleocapsid which surrounds the nucleic acids.</p> <p>And you can see that there's a series of nucleic acids that are  enclosed within this. And, again, there are eight of them. And they're  all minus strand.</p> <p>And, importantly, contained within here is a protein, an RNA  dependent RNA polymerase, the yellow dot. And it has to get incorporated  with the virus so that when the virus infects it goes in there, too.</p> <p>And it can then act on the RNA genome and convert it into a plus  strand, which will then serve both as the RNA for translation, as well  as the template for the production of more of the minus strand RNA.</p> <p>OK? So this comes from your book, and it is a summary of the infectious cycle of this virus.</p> <p>I've modified it a little bit because some of the details which I  think are important were missing. So you might want to pay attention to  this figure as you're reading the section, the relevant section in the  book.</p> <p>But this is a typical viral lifecycle.</p> <p>The virus attaches. Remember, the terms that I used last time? The  virus attaches. Here one of the viral glycoproteins binds to a protein  on the surface of the target cell. That then initiates an  internalization process, a penetration process in which the virus gets  brought in through an endosome.</p> <p>So it gets brought in through a separate vesicle, an endosome. That  vesicle, the endosome then fuses with a lysosome, not shown here.</p> <p>And you may recall that the lysosomes have very low pH. And it's in  the context of the low pH that one of the viral glycoproteins changes  its shape.</p> <p>And when it changes its shape it allows the viral membrane to fuse  with the membrane of the lysosome. So this is a pH-dependant protein  conformational change which turns an inner protein into a protein that  facilitates fusion.</p> <p>And when that happens, the viral capsid can then slip out into the cytoplasm.</p> <p>It gets unpackaged. The RNA, which is the minus strand RNA gets  released. And then it gets acted on by that RNA dependent RNA polymerase  that came in and gets converted from minus strand to plus strand.</p> <p>And the plus strand can then do two things. It can get translated  into viral proteins, both the glycoproteins that go through the sorting  pathway and make it to the membrane, as well as the structural proteins  that form the capsid.</p> <p>The structural proteins then join up with the viral RNA segments, now the minus strand RNA segments.</p> <p>They meet at the membrane and then bud off to form a new virus. OK?  So this is a standard infectious cycle for this class of viruses. And  because it's going to be relevant later, I just want to emphasize a  couple of points.</p> <p>Through interactions between the cytoplasmic tail of the envelope  glycoprotiens, the capsid proteins coalesce underneath the plasma  membrane.</p> <p>And there's an interaction between these proteins and the tails of  these proteins which causes the virus to start to bud off the surface of  the cell.</p> <p>Now, there are separate interactions with the proteins on the inside  of the capsid which bring with them the different viral RNA.</p> <p>So remember there are eight. And there's a rather amazing process by  which the eight distinct RNA segments get brought together into the  capsid, and then the capsid goes to the membrane and gets budded.</p> <p>So there is a sorting process, which we don't fully understand, that  ensures that viruses get at least one copy of each of the genomic  segments.</p> <p>And that's necessary because if a virus doesn't have all eight, when  it gets into the host cell that it might infect, it's not going to be  able to replicate. These RNA segments encode one, or at most two of the  viral proteins that are necessary for the infectious cycle that's drawn  up there.</p> <p>And you'll see why that's important in a moment.</p> <p>OK. So we get infected, we develop antibodies against the proteins of  the virus, and we typically develop them against the glycoproteins that  are sitting on the outside.</p> <p>We develop T cells that can recognize virus infected cells and kill  them. And yet we keep getting flu. So why is that? How is it that we  can, how is it that the virus can overcome this immune resistance?</p> <p>And the answer is that the virus changes.</p> <p>And this is a major problem with all viruses, but it's a particular  problem with RNA viruses and a particular problem with flu. So here's a  depiction of the virus again. It's got its genomic segments in here.</p> <p>And on the surface it has these glycoproteins. And I'm going to draw a little bit more detail in these glycoproteins now.</p> <p>There are actually two distinct glycoproteins on the surface of the  cell. There's one that's called HA and there's another that's called NA.</p> <p>And they carry out different functions. When you get infected, your  immune system sees these epitopes sitting on the surface of the virus  and you make antibodies against them. And there are three particular  places on these proteins where good antibodies can be made inside your  body.</p> <p>One of them is here, another one is here, and a third one is here.</p> <p>And different people make different of these antibodies.</p> <p>And these antibodies that are made have a name which is neutralizing  or blocking antibodies. They're called that because if you have one of  these antibodies, and it will bind to the surface of the viral particle,  this virus can now not infect the cell.</p> <p>There's an interference between the, what the hell?</p> <p>Between the glycoproteins on the surface and the receptors to which  they bind by the antibody. So they block binding. And if you cannot bind  you cannot infect.</p> <p>And this is very efficient. This works. So that's how you can  overcome the infection to that particular virus. The problem is that  viruses change. During their replication there are mutations.</p> <p>And sometimes these mutations affect the structure of the proteins that are sitting on the surface.</p> <p>So you might imagine the strain here gives rise to variant here which  has an HA protein which looks more or less the same, but it has an NA  protein which has changed. So now this epitope, which was recognized by  antibody three, cannot be recognized by antibody three because it's got a  difference sequence.</p> <p>OK? If you were a person who made predominantly antibody three in  response to this infection, you would not be susceptible to this virus.</p> <p>So if this one came along next year you'd get the flu. If you were a  person who made antibody one or antibody two as your major protective  antibody, you'd still be resistant to this. You'd be one of the lucky  ones.</p> <p>And because there's heterogeneity within our population, even if  these new variants arise, they don't spread all that much because there  are enough people in the population who are pretty well protected.</p> <p>So those are low-level spread or low-level epidemics. OK? Now, this process, one day I'm going to figure out how this works.</p> <p>This process of generating variant viruses through this mutational mechanism is called antigenic drift.</p> <p>It's a slow drift of the antigens on the virus.</p> <p>And it happens because the virus is highly mutagenic. And it's true of RNA viruses in general.</p> <p>And there are two reasons why RNA viruses create variants at such high levels. One is that RNA is less stable than DNA.</p> <p>Remember, there's a difference in the structure of RNA versus DNA.  There's an extra hydroxyl in the structure of RNA which can cause  increased mutation, increased breaks and base substitutions in our RNA  molecules compared to DNA molecules.</p> <p>So RNA is inherently less stable than DNA.</p> <p>And also RNA polymerases lack proofreading functions.</p> <p>Which means they have an inherently higher mutation rate.</p> <p>And hopefully, again, this is familiar from our discussions about DNA replication.</p> <p>All polymerases make mistakes but your DNA polymerases have what's  called a proofreading function which can recognize the mistakes and  correct them. RNA polymerases lack that, and so they make the mistakes  and they stay as mistakes.</p> <p>So the mutation rates for RNA polymerases are at least ten fold  higher than for DNA polymerases, and in some places even higher still.  OK.</p> <p>So that's what's called antigenic shift, sorry, antigenic drift.</p> <p>And it happens all the time and is responsible for why we keep  getting mild cases of the flu. But that's not what's responsible for the  Spanish flu of 1918. Instead of antigenic drift --</p> <p>-- these are due to a phenomenon called antigenic shift.</p> <p>Rather than generating subtly different variants, like I've shown up  here, this is the process of generating essentially entirely new  strains.</p> <p>And it happens in the case of flu all the time. And one of the  reasons that it happens is that there are lots and lots of types of flu  viruses which are kind of similar that infect other species.</p> <p>There are duck flus, swine flus, horse flus, seal flus that are all caused by versions of this influenza A virus.</p> <p>Similar. Not identical but similar. And sometimes those viruses cross  over into the human population. And this is an example of a zoonotic  infection --</p> <p>-- which is an infection from another species into the human population.</p> <p>And actually happens all the time. Many of the new pathogens that  arise in the human population arise through zoonotic infection. Now,  most viruses that are evolved to grow in the cells of one given species,  at the temperature of a given species, will not replicate very well  inside human cells.</p> <p>So even if they did infect, they wouldn't reproduce themselves very well.</p> <p>And that would be true of these viruses, too, swine flu virus, bird  flu viruses. The problem is, in the case of flu, the human virus is so  common and the mechanism of replication of this virus is so complex and  amenable to generation of recombinant viruses that we can generate new  viral forms.</p> <p>And that's what I want to talk to you about now. So here's an example from not too long ago.</p> <p>This is the collection and culling of a lot of birds somewhere in Asia. I'm not really sure where this was.</p> <p>But there was a concern that a new virus was developing in a bird  population and was crossing over into humans. And it caused some deaths.  And so to avoid that further they just wiped out some millions of these  birds in order to prevent further cross infection.</p> <p>But, again, it's not the presence of the virus, the bird virus or swine virus itself that's the problem.</p> <p>It's the fact that the two viruses, the human virus and the bird  virus can recombine to form a dangerous new virus which is rather  similar to the human virus but carries some segments of the bird virus.</p> <p>And that's illustrated here, and I'll show you on the board in a  second. But basically the idea is that a human virus carrying its eight  segments, including the segment for HA and NA infects an animal which  also gets infected by a bird virus.</p> <p>So that in the same cell there are the segments for the human virus, as well as the segments for the bird virus.</p> <p>And during this process of the generation of a new viral particle,  you can get mixing of the segments so that most of the segments come  from the human virus and, therefore, will replicate well in the context  of the human cell.</p> <p>But two new segments come in from the bird that encode its HA and NA, a version that's never been seen in the human population.</p> <p>Nobody has antibodies against it so the virus can spread like  wildfire. And that's what we believe happened then and we fear continues  to happen over time. So, again, imagine a cell which has been infected  by two different viruses, the avian virus, in this case it was a duck,  as well as the human virus in that given year.</p> <p>In that cell there are going to be lots of different segments of  virus RNA, the human ones H1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and so on, as well as  the duck ones, duck 1, duck 2 and so on and so forth, duck 7 and duck 8.</p> <p>When the viral capsids coalesce underneath the viral glycoproteins to  produce a new virus, they cannot necessarily distinguish between the  human and the duck subunits.</p> <p>So there might be human 1, human 2, human 3, duck 4, human 5, duck 6, human 7 and human 8.</p> <p>OK? This then makes a virus which is perfectly able to replicate in  human cells because it's got mostly the genes that are optimized for  human cells, but it's got new HA and NA forms that have never been seen  by the human population.</p> <p>So there is nobody who has antibodies against it. So the virus will  spread like crazy. OK? So this is an example of antigenic shift, and  it's responsible for these worldwide pandemics.</p> <p>OK. Any questions about flu? One thing I failed to mention, sort of  trivial but you probably know, is it spread very well because it can  spread in water droplets.</p> <p>If you sneeze on your friends they'll also get the flu. It's a very  efficient virus so you don't need very many viral particles to go inside  of your respiratory system in order to initiate the infection.</p> <p>And this is another good example. When you have a very active  infection inside of you, you start producing lots of the cytokines, that  I mentioned last time, like interferons.</p> <p>And, again, it's largely those that are causing the symptoms of the flu, and in large enough quantities can cause death.</p> <p>You can also get secondary infections with bacteria when you're that  sick, which can be another reason why folks die. OK. So if there are no  other questions about flu, we'll now turn our attention to HIV.</p> <p>And I think HIV is probably fairly familiar as a topic.</p> <p>It's, of course, a major, major worldwide health problem. The initiation of this epidemic goes back a very long way.</p> <p>The first cases were reported in 1975, so about 30 years ago.</p> <p>And so that's considered to be the initiation of this epidemic or pandemic.</p> <p>The first case in the United States is considered to have occurred in  1980. And here's another example. We think that this probably occurred  by one of the zoonotic infections.</p> <p>But it happened a long time ago.</p> <p>It happened at least before 1950 because there are samples of  individuals who died of unknown causes that have now been tested and can  be shown to have HIV sequences by PCR.</p> <p>So whenever this happened, and from whatever species it happened, it happened quite a while ago.</p> <p>Why it then initiated in this epidemic form much later is not so clear. The etiological agent --</p> <p>-- is a virus called HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.</p> <p>It is a retro virus. And we'll briefly review how it replicated, but I told you more or less how that happens last time.</p> <p>And this was another good example. The syndrome was first discovered  in 1975, gained a lot of attention in this country starting in the early  1980s, and the virus was first purified and characterized in 1983.</p> <p>So it didn't take too long to identify the agent and then ultimately sequence its genome.</p> <p>And also to develop tests for the presence of actually not the virus  itself. The AIDS test is a test for the presence of antibodies in you  that recognize the viral glycoproteins.</p> <p>And this was very important, obviously, in screening populations, screening blood banks and so on for contaminated samples.</p> <p>Now, since this time, in the early 1980s, the situation has, of course, gotten much, much worse.</p> <p>In this country, there are currently --</p> <p>-- a million people infected with HIV. That's between, you know, one and 300 individuals total.</p> <p>And, amazingly, about 20% of those people don't know it. Worldwide,  anybody have any idea how many people are infected with HIV in the  world? 40 million.</p> <p>And total about 60 million people have been infected because since  the early 1980s, 20 million people have died from this disease.</p> <p>More than 20 million. And the prevalence is remarkable in certain places in the world.</p> <p>In Southern Africa, for example, not the country of South Africa but  in the Southern Region of Africa, Saharan Africa, there are 25 million  people infected.</p> <p>And in certain countries that's one in four sexually active individuals.</p> <p>Remarkable infection rates. And the effect of this disease and the  death that it causes has also had dramatic effects on the population. So  that in Zimbabwe, for example, where the life expectancy in 1990 was 52  years old, not a huge number but 52 years old, in 2003, because of  AIDS, it's less then 35 years.</p> <p>So it has dramatically affected the lives of people throughout the world.</p> <p>OK. And, as you know, I suspect you know that transmission for this  virus occurs through direct contact of contaminated fluids. Sexual  contact, which is both homosexual and heterosexual.</p> <p>As well as blood transfusion, direct blood contact, through transfusion, and also needle sharing.</p> <p>And sometimes occasionally organ donation, but that's very, very rare. OK.</p> <p>So people die from AIDS because they develop infections. And we'll  talk a bit more about that in a moment. But here's one patient who has  developed an infection with a virus, a particular type of herpes virus  now called Kaposi's sarcoma virus.</p> <p>That virus then is able to replicate in certain cells of the blood vasculature and cause tumors.</p> <p>These are actually tumors. And this individual will die from a  disease called Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer, another example of a  virus-associated cancer of humans. And in this country AIDS, as you  probably know, has taken over as the leading killer of young male  adults.</p> <p>It was not known in the early 1980s, and by 1992, just ten years  later had become the major killer of young male adults in this country.</p> <p>And, of course, likewise around the world. So here's the virus. As I  said, it's a retrovirus. Retroviruses also are enveloped. They have  glycoproteins on the outside, envelope glycoproteins. They have a capsid  like all viruses do.</p> <p>They have a genome. The genome is made of RNA.</p> <p>And, as you know, through the retroviral lifecycle, the RNA is  converted into a DNA form. We'll go over that next time. And that's  accomplished by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase which gets  prepackaged with the virus.</p> <p>Again, it has to be there because your cells don't have an RNA  dependent RNA polymerase. So this gets prepackaged. The virus then  infects cells. And this, again, is a somewhat oversimplification.</p> <p>I'll show you more details in a second. But the virus attaches via  glycoproteins on its surface, membrane proteins on the surface of the  host cell. In this case it's a familiar protein to you called CD4.</p> <p>That leads to a fusion event. So now at the plasma membrane, which is  different from what we saw with flu virus which happened in an internal  membrane, at the plasma membrane there's a fusion event.</p> <p>So now the viral membrane fuses with the host cell membrane and the viral capsid can lead into the cytoplasm.</p> <p>There's a little bit of unpackaging that goes on. And then reverse  transcriptase, that enzyme that got prepackaged there acts on the viral  genome, which is made of RNA and converts it to a DNA form, a  double-stranded DNA form which is called a provirus.</p> <p>And that provirus then gets integrated into the host cell genome in a  random process, random integration, the host cell genome. This is also  accomplished by a pre-packed enzyme called integrase. Once in the genome  it gets treated like any old piece of DNA.</p> <p>It gets transcribed into actually multiple different RNAs.</p> <p>They get translated into viral proteins which come together at the  plasma membrane and the glycoproteins, the capsid proteins which  incorporate the genome, plus the reverse transcriptase, and you make a  new particle.</p> <p>OK? So this is more or less the lifecycle. There is some detail that I  want to share with you in a moment because it's interesting. This is  what it looks like in real life.</p> <p>These are HIV particles budding off the surface of an infected cell.</p> <p>They have a very characteristic electron dense structure. You can  actually tell it is HIV from just the way it looks in the electron  microscope. And this is an HIV infected T cell. Now, CD4 should have  rung a bell that it's one of the proteins on the surface of helper T  cells, CD4 positive T cells.</p> <p>That is a major cell of infection for HIV. And here is one such cell infected.</p> <p>And all these little blebs budding off the surface of this cell are  viruses getting out. This process actually doesn't itself, the budding  process doesn't itself kill the T cell but, nevertheless, T cells, this  class of T cells dies.</p> <p>And, actually, that's a critical event in the development of  HIV-AIDS, the disease. We'll come to that in a second, but let me first  tell you one of the interesting details.</p> <p>The situation is a little more complicated than the figure that I gave you on that slide.</p> <p>There are two glycoproteins on the surface of HIV. One of them is called GP120 for glycoprotein 120.</p> <p>It's linked by a disulfide linkage to another protein called GP41.  And we now know that both of these proteins participate in binding and  fusion.</p> <p>And on the surface of the infected cell is CD4, as was indicated on  that slide. And that is the major viral receptor that is present on  helper T cells, CD4 positive T cells. It's also present on macrophages.</p> <p>As well as certain cells in the brain called glial cells.</p> <p>So there are CD4 positive macrophages and glial cells.  AIDS-associated dementia, which you may know about, is caused by the  destruction of the glial cells in the brain. Now, there's another  protein which participates, not so much in the binding but in the fusion  event that allows the virus to get in.</p> <p>And this is actually a class of proteins called chemokine receptors.</p> <p>There are actually multiple chemokine receptors on your cells.</p> <p>And, in fact, different HIV forms bind to different of these. But  just to simplify, let's say that there is one of these which binds to  the GP41 portion. And it's that binding that allows the virus to fuse.</p> <p>If you don't have this you cannot fuse.</p> <p>And, therefore, the cells are not infected. What's interesting about  that is two-fold. One, it could represent a therapeutic target. That  interaction could be a therapeutic target.</p> <p>But it came to light in an interesting way which was there are people  who have been followed a long time who lived in high-risk populations,  drug-users or homosexual men with multiple contacts with known HIV  infected people who have not themselves gotten HIV.</p> <p>They seem to be naturally resistant to the development of HIV, despite documented exposure to the virus.</p> <p>And they were studied. And when that observation was made it was  found that these individuals lack the chemokine receptor. And if you  lack the chemokine receptor, you may have CD4 on the surface of your  cells but you don't have that critical co-receptor.</p> <p>And so there can be binding but no fusion.</p> <p>So your cells are resistant. So these individuals are naturally resistant to HIV. OK.</p> <p>So HIV infects. It infects a lot of T cells, helper T cells and other  cells in the body. Why do you get sick? Well, as I mentioned, people  get sick because of the loss, the absence --</p> <p>During infection, the CD4 positive T cells get eliminated.</p> <p>How exactly they get eliminated, why exactly they get eliminated we  don't yet know, but we know that the levels of these cells goes down  inside the infected individual.</p> <p>And, as you probably remember, CD4 positive T cells --</p> <p>-- are required for the development of these cells.</p> <p>So if you don't have CD4 positive T cells you cannot make antibody producing cells.</p> <p>You cannot make functional antibodies.</p> <p>And, to some extent, they're also required for the development of  cytotoxic T cells. So that part of the immune system is also  compromised. So the virus wipes out these cells and, therefore, the  immune system crashes.</p> <p>And that's why it's called AIDS for acquired immunodeficiency.</p> <p>Acquired because it comes through an infectious agent.  Immunodeficiency because your immune system crashes. And when your  immune system crashes you cannot fight infections.</p> <p>And AIDS patients largely die because they get one or another type of infection.</p> <p>So this is a graph which shows the time course of HIV infection. And it kind of makes the point that T cells go away.</p> <p>Shortly after you are infected, the level of HIV in your blood goes way, way up, as you can see here.</p> <p>It spikes in the first several months after your infection. Some  people actually manifest that aspect of the disease. Many don't so they  don't know that they have such a high concentration of virus.</p> <p>And, importantly, your body deals with it so you make antibodies, in  black. You make anti-HIV antibodies. And, remember, it's these that are  detected by the AIDS test. If you've been exposed then you make  antibodies.</p> <p>And they stick around so that you know that you've been infected.</p> <p>Likewise, T cells, cytotoxic T cells, CD8 positive T cells go up. And  that controls the level of the virus. And it stays low for a while, but  after a while, because of the affects on the CD4 positive T cells, the  other cells in the immune system are no longer sustained so the B cells  start to drop off and the T cells start to drop off.</p> <p>And now you're starting to lose the battle against the HIV, so the levels of HIV go up.</p> <p>And as they go up, you lose more CD4 positive T cells and the  situation gets worse and worse. So after a while, usually in the several  years out time point, your immune system is now no longer functional  and you're very susceptible to opportunistic infections.</p> <p>So AIDS patients will develop infections, and the infections will progress in a way that won't happen in a healthy person.</p> <p>Certain bacterial infections that you would clearly very easily take hold and can cause major problems.</p> <p>Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by infection of this particular virus.  AIDS patients are very susceptible to tuberculosis, this particular  fungal infection, certain other viral infections. And in aggregate, the  exposure to these various infectious agents and the damage that they're  causing leads to the death of the patient.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>So that's bad news. And obviously it's have major and devastating  consequences around the world. So what can we do about it? Well, there  is some good news here.</p> <p>There are antiviral therapies.</p> <p>Remember that viruses largely use your enzymes.</p> <p>And you cannot make good drugs against your own enzymes for treatment  of a viral disease, but I've told you about one viral protein to which  you might be able to make drugs. And indeed we have.</p> <p>HIV has an RNA genome that gets converted to a DNA form by an enzyme reverse transcriptase.</p> <p>There have been drugs produced that block that enzyme. And you've probably heard of the drug AZT.</p> <p>There are other drugs like dideoxyinosine and dideoxycytosine that likewise bind to and block the activity of this enzyme.</p> <p>They actually cause chain termination in the same way that DNA  sequencing works. And they work because this enzyme is sensitive to  these drugs at concentrations where your polymerases are not, so that  gives you some selected effect in the treatment of the virus.</p> <p>And these agents, when used singly, work for a while.</p> <p>And then the virus becomes resistant and comes roaring back. How does  it become resistant? It becomes resistant through mutation, exactly the  way cancer cells become resistant to targeted therapies.</p> <p>Variant forms of HIV arise which have slightly altered reverse  transcriptases that now won't bind to AZT or DDI or DDC. And the problem  is very, very serious because viruses, RNA viruses in particular are  highly mutagenic.</p> <p>They create variant forms at high frequency.</p> <p>An HIV infected person makes ten to the tenth viral particles a day.  At a mutation rate of ten to the minus fifth, that would mean ten to the  fifth variants of every nucleotide. OK? So variants come up frequently  that are resistant to this therapy.</p> <p>Oops.</p> <p>Fortunately, there are alternatives. The viral RNA gets translated into a large polyprotein --</p> <p>-- which is processed by a viral protease encoded by the virus into different mature proteins.</p> <p>Reverse transcriptase is one of them. The integrase that I mentioned  is another. And there are others. This is a viral protein, a viral  enzyme.</p> <p>And so, in theory, it's possible to make inhibitors against the protease.</p> <p>And that's been successful. Several companies have made inhibitors  that will specifically inhibit the viral protease that work well. They  work for a while and then resistant forms arise for exactly the same  reason I said.</p> <p>You can create versions of protease which still work but won't bind  the drug. OK? So what do you do? Does anybody know what you do to  overcome this problem?</p> <p>You put the drugs together.</p> <p>So currently HIV patients, in this country anyway, and hopefully soon  around the world will get triple therapy when they're diagnosed.</p> <p>And triple therapy includes two reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one protease inhibitor.</p> <p>Since the development of resistance against each of these agents is  independent of the other, to get resistance to all three is the product  of the individual frequency.</p> <p>So I said that the frequency of developing resistance to any one is ten to the minus fifth.</p> <p>To be resistant to all three would occur at ten to the minus  fifteenth, which is highly, highly unlikely. And so people tend not to  develop resistance to all three and, therefore, triple therapy tends to  keep the virus in-check for sustained periods of time.</p> <p>As you probably know, this works.</p> <p>The fear is that it is starting not to work. And there are starting  to be some resistant forms developing here and they are starting to make  their way into the population, so we're going to have to develop even  better and more different inhibitors to now combat these variant forms.</p> <p>Before I let you go, the last thing I wanted to mention, and I'll  just throw it out there and you can think about it, is that what we'd  really like to return to for HIV is what we can do for polio.</p> <p>We'd like to be able to treat people routinely in this country or out  in the field in more distant regions with an effective vaccine, which  isn't possible today.</p> <p>We don't have one for HIV. You might think about what you would do to  make one and why it has been so hard. And I'll touch on that next time.</p>
