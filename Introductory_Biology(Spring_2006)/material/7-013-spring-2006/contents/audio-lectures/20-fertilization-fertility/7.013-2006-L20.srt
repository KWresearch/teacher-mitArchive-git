1
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
What I'd like to do today,
is to give you an epilogue,

2
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
the very end of the last lecture on
cell type, that I did not want to

3
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
cram into the very last one minute,
so I'm going to take five minutes

4
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
now to talk about that,
and then I want to move on to a

5
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
topic that is very related,
because everything, of course,

6
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
is very much related by the control
of gene expression,

7
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
by cell-cell interactions,
by cell fate, and so on, but I want

8
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
to talk to you about a particularly
important set of interactions

9
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
between cells.
Here we are, on your game board of

10
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
life, we're moving up through the
formation module,

11
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
talked about cell type,
and we're going to build on that

12
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
conversation in talking about
fertilization today.

13
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
So let me go back and remind you
where we were.

14
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
At the very end of last lecture we
were talking about cell type,

15
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
and what I wanted to do with you,
was to trace for you the ontogeny,

16
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
the development of a particular type
of cell, and indicate to you how

17
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
many different interactions there
were between cells --

18
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
-- how many different sets of genes
had to be activated,

19
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
and had to interact with one another,
to get you from a fertilized egg,

20
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
all the way to a differentiated cell
type, and I used the paradigm of

21
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
skeletal muscle.
And really, the point that I think

22
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
you got, was that this is very
complicated, and if you go on in

23
00:03:36 --> 00:03:40
your careers and think about,
as engineers for example, as

24
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
biologists, engineering a particular
kind of cell from another kind of

25
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
cell, you really have to know these
steps along the way,

26
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
and ask whether or not in order to
get from point a to point b,

27
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
you have to go through the whole set
of 30 steps --

28
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
-- or whether you can circumvent
those steps, and short-circuit,

29
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
and go on a much shorter route.  And
we'll talk more about this in

30
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
subsequent lectures,
but this is very relevant for

31
00:04:08 --> 00:04:13
thinking about how to engineer
particular cell types.

32
00:04:13 --> 00:04:17
What we were talking about was an
extraordinary experiment that was

33
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
done in the 1920's,
that demonstrated a piece of

34
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
embryonic tissue called the
organizer of the dorsal mesoderm,

35
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
was able to activate the formation
of a second --

36
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
[PAUSE[
-- axis, or a second conjoined

37
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
embryo, where most of the second
embryo was derived from the host

38
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
tissue, into which this piece of
organizer, or dorsal mesoderm,

39
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
had been transplanted.  And this
organizer was able to induce a

40
00:04:53 --> 00:04:58
second embryo,
including skeletal muscle,

41
00:04:58 --> 00:05:04
must be made from the host cells.

42
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
OK, who does not have their handouts
here from the last lecture?

43
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
I'm not trying to nail you,
I just want to know if I need to

44
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
write something on the board.
I need to write something on the

45
00:05:16 --> 00:05:21
board, OK.  So,
the notion that we were left with

46
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
was that, until now,
we had gotten to the point where

47
00:05:25 --> 00:05:29
genetic information that had defined
the dorsal part of the embryo,

48
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
synergized with genetic information
that formed the dorsal mesoderm that

49
00:05:33 --> 00:05:40
formed the mesoderm.
That gave rise to this piece of

50
00:05:40 --> 00:05:48
tissue called dorsal mesoderm,
abbreviated meso, which is also

51
00:05:48 --> 00:05:56
known as the organizer.
And this piece of dorsal mesoderm,

52
00:05:56 --> 00:06:04
or organizer, itself, as I said, a
very powerful inducing center,

53
00:06:04 --> 00:06:12
and it induces formation of a group
of tissue blocks called somites.

54
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
These somites,
as I'll show you in a moment,

55
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
are segments, or segmental units,
that are present along the whole

56
00:06:20 --> 00:06:24
axis of the body,
the whole trunk region of the body

57
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
of vertebras.  And they actually
hark back to our ancestry,

58
00:06:28 --> 00:06:32
derived from organisms that were
fully segmented,

59
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
worms for example,
earthworm type animals,

60
00:06:36 --> 00:06:41
that had multiple segments.
OK.  The somites,

61
00:06:41 --> 00:06:48
in turn, become subdivided,
and I put this in just to indicate,

62
00:06:48 --> 00:06:55
again, the complexity of the process,
and part of the somite,

63
00:06:55 --> 00:07:02
termed the myotome, activates the
expression of the transcription

64
00:07:02 --> 00:07:08
factor myoD.
And it was pointed out to me by

65
00:07:08 --> 00:07:14
Christine that I was abbreviating
transcription factor,

66
00:07:14 --> 00:07:20
TXN that is my abbreviation,
many of you may remember from way

67
00:07:20 --> 00:07:26
back, for transcription.
So, if you have in your previous

68
00:07:26 --> 00:07:31
notes, a TXN, and you're not sure
what I meant, I meant transcription.

69
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
OK, so these somites get subdivided,
they make the myotome that expresses

70
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
myoD, and as we talked about last
time, we come in full circle to

71
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
where we wanted to be,
which is the activation of the

72
00:07:49 --> 00:07:54
skeletal muscle program.
Let me show you this on this

73
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
PowerPoint slide.
OK, so here are the organizers in

74
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
diagram, activating the formation,
or inducing the formation, of these

75
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
somites.  The somites get divided,
myoD is expressed, myoD and other

76
00:08:07 --> 00:08:12
family members,
remember I made the point this was a

77
00:08:12 --> 00:08:17
member of a redundant transcription
factor, a redundant gene family,

78
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
myoD maintains its own expression
through a positive alter

79
00:08:21 --> 00:08:26
regulatory route.
That means it binds to its own

80
00:08:26 --> 00:08:32
promoter, and perpetuates,
or activates, its own transcription,

81
00:08:32 --> 00:08:38
so once myoD is expressed, it
maintains its own expression,

82
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
a very popular way of stabilizing
gene expression in particular cell

83
00:08:44 --> 00:08:50
types.  OK, here are some pictures
of early human embryos.

84
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
Now, you should realize,
the reason in this previous slide

85
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
that I went from a round circle
representing a round ball of cells

86
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
as an embryo, to no circle,
is that everything I've told you

87
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
until now, took place in a round
ball of cells,

88
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
OK?  Up to about the 4,
00th cell stage, or about the 10,

89
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
00th cell stage, the frog embryo is
just a round ball of cells,

90
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
and most embryos are not very
distinguished looking.

91
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
But the process of making somites
and dividing them,

92
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
goes on until the embryo is a
million cells or more,

93
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
and during that time, the embryo
reorganizes its body plan,

94
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
so it's not longer a ball of cells,
it starts to take on its

95
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
characteristic form.
And some of the characteristic form

96
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
it takes on, is shown in this human
embryo, about 19 days after

97
00:09:38 --> 00:09:42
fertilization,
this region here is going to be the

98
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
nervous system --
-- and on either side of the nervous

99
00:09:46 --> 00:09:52
system, I've got in red here,
boxed these little segmented blocks,

100
00:09:52 --> 00:09:57
and you can see these segmented
blocks in older embryos.

101
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
Those are the somites from which
most of the skeletal muscle is going

102
00:10:03 --> 00:10:09
to form.  This is a movie to show
you the segmentation

103
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
of the somites.
So here they go,

104
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
here are the blocks of cells being
divided one from another,

105
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
it's a very beautiful process,
and you can see it's very ordered.

106
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
Down the middle here is the neural
tube, which is starting to give rise

107
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
to the central nervous system,
and on either side of the neural

108
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
tube is this future muscle tissue,
or the future somites that include

109
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
the skeletal muscle,
and you can see them being divided

110
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
symmetrically on either side of this
midline here, in to these

111
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
chunks of tissue.
And it's actually a very interesting

112
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
story in the regulation of gene
expression, as to how you time

113
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
things in such a coordinated fashion.
In all animals,

114
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
the somites become segmented first
in the head region,

115
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
and then the segmentation moves down
towards the tail,

116
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
and there is an intrinsic timer in
the embryo, that I don't have time

117
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
to describe to you,
that again, converges on the

118
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
regulation of gene expression,
that allows this extraordinarily

119
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
coordinated segmentation
of the body plan.

120
00:11:10 --> 00:11:15
OK, so what I've done is to try and
trace this ontology of the cell type.

121
00:11:15 --> 00:11:20
What you'll realize if you think
about this, is that I haven't

122
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
actually told you what transcription
factors actually activate the myoD

123
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
promoter in the somites.
This is an RNA expression pattern,

124
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
and the whole myoD regulatory loop,
is controlled in a transcriptional

125
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
way.  And we don't know what exactly
activates myoD expression in the

126
00:11:40 --> 00:11:46
somites, but we know a lot about
what happens before.

127
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
And with that,
I am going to move on to what I want

128
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
to spend most of today talking to
you about, and that is the question

129
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59
of reproduction.
And I'm going to talk to you about

130
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
the molecular biology of
reproduction, and particularly we're

131
00:12:03 --> 00:12:08
going to talk about sexual
reproduction --

132
00:12:08 --> 00:12:20
-- as one of the most important

133
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
examples of cell-cell interactions.
And in fact, the one without which

134
00:12:24 --> 00:12:29
none of us would be here,
although that, in a sense,

135
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
is a silly thing to say because
without most of the interactions,

136
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
the cell interactions during
development, none of us would

137
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42
be here anyway.
But, this is a very interesting

138
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
process, a very important process,
and it exemplifies some points that

139
00:12:46 --> 00:12:51
I want to bring up here.
So the notion here is that two

140
00:12:51 --> 00:12:56
haploid cells,
the sperm, and N is my designation

141
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
for haploid, I presume you're all
with me when I use N and 2N,

142
00:13:00 --> 00:13:05
as haploid and diploid, OK, fine.
Sperm and egg go through the

143
00:13:05 --> 00:13:14
process of fertilization --

144
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
-- to form a single cell,
a zygote that is diploid, and the

145
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
zygote will then go on to perform a
multi-cellular embryo,

146
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
etc.  Now, there are some really
extraordinary things about this.

147
00:13:26 --> 00:13:31
One of the extraordinary things is
that the sperm and the egg are fully

148
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
differentiated cells.
I have been telling you,

149
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
indeed really trying to hammer into
you, the notion that cells progress

150
00:13:39 --> 00:13:44
from less specialized states to more
specialized states.

151
00:13:44 --> 00:13:49
And this is the one instance during
development, where the flip is true,

152
00:13:49 --> 00:13:55
where the opposite is true.  So the
sperm and the egg are fully

153
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
differentiated cells,
they have reached this final cell

154
00:14:00 --> 00:14:06
type, but when they fuse,
and they form the zygote, they now

155
00:14:06 --> 00:14:12
make the most fully undifferentiated
cell. So the zygote is uncommitted,

156
00:14:12 --> 00:14:18
that may or may not be spelled
correctly.

157
00:14:18 --> 00:14:25
So the zygote is uncommitted,
and I want to introduce you to a new

158
00:14:25 --> 00:14:32
term, which is that of potency,
where potency refers to the number

159
00:14:32 --> 00:14:39
of possible fates that a cell can
assume.  We're going to talk a lot

160
00:14:39 --> 00:14:46
about this when we talk about stem
cells.  The number of possible fates

161
00:14:46 --> 00:14:53
that a cell can assume,
and the sperm and the egg are

162
00:14:53 --> 00:15:00
uni-potent, they have one possible
fate, which is themselves.

163
00:15:00 --> 00:15:05
And the opposite is true of the
zygote.  It is totipotent,

164
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
it can become everything, all
possible cell types.

165
00:15:11 --> 00:15:23
And that is the antithesis of what

166
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
happens during development in
essentially, I would say,

167
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
in every single cell type of the
body.  And it's extraordinary,

168
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
and we don't understand, we don't
understand, how you get this

169
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
complete reversal of fates,
although I'll try to go through this

170
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
with you in a future lecture.
All right, why go to all this

171
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
trouble?  This is a lot of work for
an organism to go through,

172
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
and the bottom line is that it leads
to genetic re-assortment,

173
00:15:48 --> 00:15:53
and it leads to genetic diversity.
So the notion of sexual reproduction,

174
00:15:53 --> 00:15:59
I'm going to write it up here,
is that it engenders genetic

175
00:15:59 --> 00:16:06
diversity, and it does so because
genetic materials becomes

176
00:16:06 --> 00:16:13
re-assorted during meiosis,
and during recombination, or during

177
00:16:13 --> 00:16:20
the joining together, of the
sperm and the egg.

178
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
OK, I divided this lecture up into a
few parts.  The first is

179
00:16:22 --> 00:16:38
gametal genesis --

180
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
-- where the gametes are the egg and
the sperm, just a different name for

181
00:16:42 --> 00:16:47
them, and gametogenesis is one of
those developmental biology terms

182
00:16:47 --> 00:16:51
that has the suffix "-genesis",
the creation of the gametes.  Both

183
00:16:51 --> 00:16:56
the sperm and the egg start off from
diploid, precursor cells,

184
00:16:56 --> 00:17:01
and this is a very interesting story,
but I'm not going to tell you.

185
00:17:01 --> 00:17:06
But I'll remind you, well, I'm
going to allude to it.

186
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10
I'll remind you that long ago,
I showed you these beautiful series

187
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14
of pictures from worms.
When we talked about determinants,

188
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
cell autonomous factors that control
cell fate, and I showed you how

189
00:17:18 --> 00:17:23
these determinants were segregated
into a single cell,

190
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
of the 32 cell worm embryo,
and that this cell was going to give

191
00:17:27 --> 00:17:32
rise to the gametes, the
egg and the sperm.

192
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
In fact, the exact same thing is
probably true in all animals,

193
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
including ourselves.  And certainly
in frogs, and in fish,

194
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
we know that there are determinants
that are segregated,

195
00:17:44 --> 00:17:49
and we know what these are,
they turn out to be proteins that

196
00:17:49 --> 00:17:53
bind RNA and control translation of
presumably specific target genes.

197
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
So, somewhere back in the dawn of
time, during development,

198
00:17:57 --> 00:18:03
the germ cells become determined --
-- but I am not going to talk about

199
00:18:03 --> 00:18:09
this, I am going to talk about them
when they actually already know that

200
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
they're germ cells,
and when they start thinking about

201
00:18:15 --> 00:18:21
assuming their final differentiated
fate.  And I want to make a couple

202
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
of contrasting points,
and OK, well let me do my board work

203
00:18:27 --> 00:18:32
and then we can look at that.  OK.
The precursor of the spermatozoa is

204
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
the spermatagonium.
This is a diploid cell that

205
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
undergoes meiosis,
to give rise to a haploid

206
00:18:43 --> 00:18:48
spermatazoan.  The spermatagonium is
a moderate sized cell,

207
00:18:48 --> 00:18:54
it's just a regular sized cell,
and when it undergoes its conversion,

208
00:18:54 --> 00:18:59
its differentiation,
to a  spermatazoan, or a sperm,

209
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
it becomes very small, it jettisons
most of its cytoplasm, and

210
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
it becomes motile.
So you go from a medium sized cell

211
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
to a tiny cell that has the very
important property of being motile.

212
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
And this is true, really,
universally, some,

213
00:19:23 --> 00:19:29
and I'll talk about this in a moment.
The way that spermatozoa are motile

214
00:19:29 --> 00:19:35
is slightly different in different
organisms, but they pretty much,

215
00:19:35 --> 00:19:42
all spermatozoa are motile.
In contrast, the egg arises from a

216
00:19:42 --> 00:19:50
diploid oogonium and the oogonium
also starts off as a medium sized

217
00:19:50 --> 00:19:58
cell, but it does the opposite.
It gets very big, OK?  And the

218
00:19:58 --> 00:20:06
oogonium moves to change into
something called an oocyte,

219
00:20:06 --> 00:20:14
or I prefer the term, egg, and this
was a haploid cell.  OK.

220
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
It's large, by necessity sessile,
and it's large because it stores a

221
00:20:18 --> 00:20:23
bunch of stuff,
and the stuff that it stores is food,

222
00:20:23 --> 00:20:28
to nourish the early embryo before
the embryo can fend for itself,

223
00:20:28 --> 00:20:33
or before it can be nourished by the
mother.  And it also contains

224
00:20:33 --> 00:20:38
components that regulate
early development.

225
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
So it's full of things like
determinants.  It's also full of

226
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
machinery that can make ribosomes
and so on, and the size of the egg

227
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
varies from organism to organism.
In frogs, for example, the egg is

228
00:20:50 --> 00:20:55
about a millimeter in diameter,
in humans the egg is about 50

229
00:20:55 --> 00:20:59
micrometers in diameter,
because the mother nourishes the egg

230
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
sooner than, or the embryo,
sooner in humans than in frogs.

231
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
All right, so let's look at a couple
of these diagrams that I gave you.

232
00:21:08 --> 00:21:13
This is to remind you about meiosis
and what meiosis is,

233
00:21:13 --> 00:21:18
and I want to make a couple of
points that are up here on the top,

234
00:21:18 --> 00:21:23
some of which are more important
than others.  Spermatozoa,

235
00:21:23 --> 00:21:28
and spermatogenesis, is featured by
continuing mitosis throughout life

236
00:21:28 --> 00:21:33
of the male.  All the meiotic
products become sperm,

237
00:21:33 --> 00:21:38
but this continuing mitosis is
what's really important.

238
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
The spermatogonium,
the precursor of the spermatozoa,

239
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
persists throughout life, and so you
get a lot of sperm produced.

240
00:21:47 --> 00:21:51
So we can add to our list here,
that you get many sperm.  In humans

241
00:21:51 --> 00:21:56
there are about five times ten to
the seventh sperm per ejaculate.

242
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
If you go about five-fold lower
than that, you're in the range of

243
00:22:00 --> 00:22:05
infertility.  We can talk about why
that is, and so one can do

244
00:22:05 --> 00:22:09
calculations, and it's been
calculated that males can make up to

245
00:22:09 --> 00:22:14
ten to the 13th sperm
in a lifetime.

246
00:22:14 --> 00:22:18
If you do the calculation,
you will understand that not all of

247
00:22:18 --> 00:22:23
those sperm are used,
and some are them are resorbed,

248
00:22:23 --> 00:22:28
so you can do that rather
interesting calculation another time.

249
00:22:28 --> 00:22:33
OK.  Oogenesis,
in contrast to the plentiful and

250
00:22:33 --> 00:22:38
cheap sperm, and we'll come back to
this point in a moment.

251
00:22:38 --> 00:22:43
In females, mitosis of the oogonia,
ends before birth, and in fact, by

252
00:22:43 --> 00:22:48
the time a child is born,
it is a female, it has about a

253
00:22:48 --> 00:22:53
million or so,
primary oocytes,

254
00:22:53 --> 00:22:59
which are still diploid,
they're along this pathway towards

255
00:22:59 --> 00:23:04
formation of the egg.
And by the time the child is about

256
00:23:04 --> 00:23:10
five, there are only about 500,
00 primary oocytes sites.  OK?

257
00:23:10 --> 00:23:14
And those cells have withdrawn from
the cell cycle,

258
00:23:14 --> 00:23:18
they are not making anymore of them.
So that is your pool from which to

259
00:23:18 --> 00:23:22
make eggs, and in fact,
most of those, 90% of those,

260
00:23:22 --> 00:23:26
are going to die, and you're going
to get a greater than 90% are going

261
00:23:26 --> 00:23:31
to die, and only about 500 eggs
mature during the lifetime of a

262
00:23:31 --> 00:23:35
human female.  OK?
And it's actually not quite clear

263
00:23:35 --> 00:23:39
why, but it's certainly harder to
make a good quality egg,

264
00:23:39 --> 00:23:43
probably, than to make lots of
smaller sperm,

265
00:23:43 --> 00:23:48
for reasons of energy expenditure of
the animal.

266
00:23:48 --> 00:23:53
All right, let's look through these
slides a little more.

267
00:23:53 --> 00:23:58
The testes is an extraordinary organ
that comprises many,

268
00:23:58 --> 00:24:03
many, many tubules, all coiled
together.  Within the seminiferous

269
00:24:03 --> 00:24:08
tubules there is an array of sperm
production that is architecturally

270
00:24:08 --> 00:24:14
very interesting.
Ignore this red up here for the

271
00:24:14 --> 00:24:19
moment, and look at this
architecture of the

272
00:24:19 --> 00:24:24
wall of one of the
The developing spermatozoa are

273
00:24:24 --> 00:24:29
embedded in cells called Sertoli
cells.  Sertoli cells supports,

274
00:24:29 --> 00:24:34
and nourish, and induce the
formation of the mature spermatozoa.

275
00:24:34 --> 00:24:40
So the spermatozoa that are most
immature, are lying away from the

276
00:24:40 --> 00:24:45
luminal, the cavity,
of the seminiferous tubule,

277
00:24:45 --> 00:24:50
and as these cells mature and
undergo meiosis,

278
00:24:50 --> 00:24:55
they move closer and closer to the
lumen, until you get a bunch of

279
00:24:55 --> 00:25:00
spermatozoa, with these tails
pointing out into the lumen of the

280
00:25:00 --> 00:25:06
tube, ready to be shed
upon ejaculation.

281
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
So it's a very beautifully,
architecturally very beautiful

282
00:25:10 --> 00:25:14
process.  Now what does the
spermatazoan actually look like?

283
00:25:14 --> 00:25:18
It's got three parts.  It's got
this head that's got a nucleus that

284
00:25:18 --> 00:25:23
is highly condensed.
I've told you previously that it's

285
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
a real feat to pack the meter of DNA
that's in every cell,

286
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
into a little, tiny nucleus.
You have to really pack it tightly.

287
00:25:31 --> 00:25:35
Well, it's even worse for a sperm
because the nucleus of a sperm is an

288
00:25:35 --> 00:25:40
order of magnitude smaller,
in many cases, than a somatic cell.

289
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
So you have to pack the DNA even
more tightly, and there are special

290
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
proteins that overcome the charges
on the DNA, to overcome the charge

291
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
repulsion on the deoxyribonucleic
acid, OK?  So these are basic

292
00:25:52 --> 00:25:57
proteins that really pack the DNA
tightly, to fit into this compact

293
00:25:57 --> 00:26:01
nucleus.  The other thing we'll talk
about, in a bit,

294
00:26:01 --> 00:26:06
is this structure called the
acrosome.

295
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
It derives from the Golgi,
which you remember is involved in

296
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
protein trafficking.
Two other regions of the sperm that

297
00:26:14 --> 00:26:18
are almost universal,
and very important, are this thing

298
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
called the mid-piece,
which is packed with mitochondria

299
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
that are going to provide energy for
the sperm as it moves.

300
00:26:26 --> 00:26:30
And finally, this tail region,
which is a flagellum, now what's a

301
00:26:30 --> 00:26:35
flagellum?
So, a flagellum is one of these

302
00:26:35 --> 00:26:39
biologically fantastic structures
that uses polymers of proteins to

303
00:26:39 --> 00:26:44
make something that works in a
concerted fashion.

304
00:26:44 --> 00:26:48
The proteins that it uses makes up
the microtubules,

305
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
so they are the tubulin proteins,
we'll have more to say about them on

306
00:26:52 --> 00:26:57
Friday.  We mentioned microtubules
in the last lecture,

307
00:26:57 --> 00:27:01
in this case, microtubules pack
together in a very ordered way,

308
00:27:01 --> 00:27:07
you can read this in your book.
Microtubules pack together in a very

309
00:27:07 --> 00:27:13
ordered way, to make this very long
structure, that when supplied with

310
00:27:13 --> 00:27:20
energy, will beat in a regular,
often a sinusoidal fashion, and

311
00:27:20 --> 00:27:26
propel the cell forward,
or wherever it is going.  All right,

312
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
female reproductive system.
The ovary is the sight of egg

313
00:27:32 --> 00:27:37
production.  In mammals,
the uterus is the site of embryo

314
00:27:37 --> 00:27:42
growth, fertilization usually occurs
somewhere between the ovary and the

315
00:27:42 --> 00:27:47
uterus, in the tube,
the oviduct, or the fallopian tube,

316
00:27:47 --> 00:27:56
between the ovary and the uterus.

317
00:27:56 --> 00:28:00
All right, this is a diagram from
your book again.

318
00:28:00 --> 00:28:04
In the developing,
in the ovary, one can find eggs of

319
00:28:04 --> 00:28:08
developing, or oocytes sites of
different stages,

320
00:28:08 --> 00:28:12
as they undergo development.
They grow larger, and lie in a

321
00:28:12 --> 00:28:16
fluid-filled cavity,
and eventually, I'll talk a bit more

322
00:28:16 --> 00:28:20
about this in a moment,
this fluid filled cavity gets very

323
00:28:20 --> 00:28:24
large, and it bursts, and
releases the egg.

324
00:28:24 --> 00:28:28
It's very interesting,
in mammals, the egg is actually

325
00:28:28 --> 00:28:33
released almost into the body cavity,
and it's gathered up by so called

326
00:28:33 --> 00:28:38
fimbrae, or folds of waving tissue
that lie at the opening of the

327
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
oviduct, or fallopian tube,
and these kind of make a current

328
00:28:42 --> 00:28:47
that draws the released egg into the
oviduct, so it can get on its way to

329
00:28:47 --> 00:28:51
the uterus.
Subsequent  to the egg being

330
00:28:51 --> 00:28:55
released, what's left of where the
egg developed in the ovary,

331
00:28:55 --> 00:28:58
forms this thing called the corpus
luteum, which secretes substances,

332
00:28:58 --> 00:29:02
hormones, that I'll talk about in a
moment, that are very important for

333
00:29:02 --> 00:29:06
maintaining pregnancy,
if this occurs.

334
00:29:06 --> 00:29:11
All right, you can see what I'm
dwelling on here,

335
00:29:11 --> 00:29:16
not dwelling on.  I'll dwell on
things that I feel are more

336
00:29:16 --> 00:29:21
important, by writing things on the
board, OK?  So,

337
00:29:21 --> 00:29:26
stay with me.  Let's go now to a
system that I do want to dwell on

338
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
more, which is the hormonal control
of gametogenesis.

339
00:29:31 --> 00:29:36
Professor Jacks talked to you
previously about hormones.

340
00:29:36 --> 00:29:47
Hormones are made in most animals,

341
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
and their characteristic is that
they work at very long range.

342
00:29:53 --> 00:29:59
So I want to characterize these as
long-ranged, inducers,

343
00:29:59 --> 00:30:06
and they can be very long-range
inducers.  The hormones that control

344
00:30:06 --> 00:30:12
gametogenesis are made in the brain,
in the hypothalamus, and the

345
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
pituitary and they travel way
through the bloodstream to get to

346
00:30:18 --> 00:30:24
the ovaries and the testes.
This looks like a hermaphrodite here,

347
00:30:24 --> 00:30:29
[LAUGHTER], OK and this,
I just realized this, OK,

348
00:30:29 --> 00:30:34
whatever.  To get to the ovaries or
the testes, or both,

349
00:30:34 --> 00:30:39
whatever, {LAUGHTER],
OK, anyway, that point I want to

350
00:30:39 --> 00:30:44
make is that these hormones work at
a very long distance.

351
00:30:44 --> 00:30:49
And I want to contrast that with
the kinds of inducers that wee have

352
00:30:49 --> 00:30:54
been talking about in the preceding
couple of lectures.

353
00:30:54 --> 00:30:59
The kind of classical,
embryonic inducers, which act at

354
00:30:59 --> 00:31:05
very short range.
So, for example, we talked about

355
00:31:05 --> 00:31:14
nodal signaling --

356
00:31:14 --> 00:31:18
-- last lecture.
For example, nodal,

357
00:31:18 --> 00:31:22
which is a ligand I mentioned,
pivotal in making the mesoderm,

358
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
nodal can only work over one, or a
few, cell diameters.

359
00:31:26 --> 00:31:30
So if you were cells,
you could have a conversation with

360
00:31:30 --> 00:31:34
one another, or maybe,
the signal could get all the way to

361
00:31:34 --> 00:31:38
here, but it sure wouldn't get to
the back of the room.

362
00:31:38 --> 00:31:44
Whereas, if you were a hormone,
your signal would get all the way

363
00:31:44 --> 00:31:50
back to the back of the room,
and probably all the way down the

364
00:31:50 --> 00:31:56
infinite corridor.
OK, so there's a real order of

365
00:31:56 --> 00:32:02
magnitude different in the way
hormones and other inducers can act.

366
00:32:02 --> 00:32:08
So, one to a few cells.
All right, there are a bunch of

367
00:32:08 --> 00:32:13
different kinds of hormones that are
involved in control of gametogenesis.

368
00:32:13 --> 00:32:18
I want to distinguish the steroid
hormones, which are derivatives of

369
00:32:18 --> 00:32:23
cholesterol, and we mentioned them
long ago in the lipid section.

370
00:32:23 --> 00:32:28
Steroids that include testosterone,
estrogen, and progesterone, and act

371
00:32:28 --> 00:32:33
through a series of receptors that
actually lies within the cell,

372
00:32:33 --> 00:32:38
they're not membrane-bound receptors,
they are so-called nuclear receptors,

373
00:32:38 --> 00:32:44
so they act through
nuclear receptors.

374
00:32:44 --> 00:32:48
I'm actually not going to write that
on the board.  And the other

375
00:32:48 --> 00:32:53
hormones I want to indicate are
peptide hormones,

376
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57
that as their name indicates,
are small polypeptide chains, and

377
00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
these include,
I'm going to put abbreviations up,

378
00:33:02 --> 00:33:07
and you can get the full names later.
FSH, LH, and GNRH,

379
00:33:07 --> 00:33:11
follicle-stimulating hormone,
luteinizing hormone, and

380
00:33:11 --> 00:33:16
gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
One of the things that is similar

381
00:33:16 --> 00:33:20
about the hormonal control of
gametogenesis,

382
00:33:20 --> 00:33:25
to many other things we've been
talking about,

383
00:33:25 --> 00:33:30
is the notion of feedback control.
So, there is an enormous amount of

384
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
feedback, both positive and negative
in the circuitry that gives rise to

385
00:33:34 --> 00:33:39
the formation of egg and sperm.
This is an example of the circuitry

386
00:33:39 --> 00:33:44
leading to stomatogenesis.
Here is GNRH, released from the

387
00:33:44 --> 00:33:49
hypothalamus that stimulates the
anterior pituitary,

388
00:33:49 --> 00:33:54
to produce lutenizing hormone,
or follicle stimulating hormone.

389
00:33:54 --> 00:34:00
These act on cells within the
testes, which act to,

390
00:34:00 --> 00:34:05
one set of cells acts to activate
testosterone, the major male steroid

391
00:34:05 --> 00:34:10
hormone, and that acts back on the
Sertoli cells in the seminiferous

392
00:34:10 --> 00:34:15
tubules, and together,
these orchestrate the production of

393
00:34:15 --> 00:34:21
spermatozoa, and other various
responses to these hormones.

394
00:34:21 --> 00:34:26
Now, the green indicates positive
loops, and the red indicate negative

395
00:34:26 --> 00:34:32
feedback, so too much testosterone
can have the effect of inhibiting

396
00:34:32 --> 00:34:38
the anterior pituitary's production
of lutenizing hormone,

397
00:34:38 --> 00:34:44
or follicle-stimulating hormone.
And there's a very careful balance

398
00:34:44 --> 00:34:50
of these hormones in the normal
animal.  Now, in females,

399
00:34:50 --> 00:34:56
things look similar.  Again,
GNRG, LH, and FSH, are produced to

400
00:34:56 --> 00:35:02
stimulate, release,
and maturation of oocytes,

401
00:35:02 --> 00:35:07
and release from the ovary.
The ovary, instead of producing

402
00:35:07 --> 00:35:12
testosterone, although it does
produce some of that,

403
00:35:12 --> 00:35:16
produces estrogen and progesterone,
and those are both required for

404
00:35:16 --> 00:35:21
normal maturation of the egg,
and also for subsequent pregnancy.

405
00:35:21 --> 00:35:26
And also, as you will see, there is
a feedback loop of both estrogen and

406
00:35:26 --> 00:35:31
progesterone, onto the hypothalamus
and the anterior pituitary.

407
00:35:31 --> 00:35:34
And as this feedback loop that is
exploited in the birth control pill,

408
00:35:34 --> 00:35:38
where if one gives high levels of
estrogen and progesterone,

409
00:35:38 --> 00:35:42
you suppress the production of both
GNRH from the hypothalamus,

410
00:35:42 --> 00:35:46
and LH and FSH from the anterior
pituitary and therefore suppress the

411
00:35:46 --> 00:35:50
production of eggs from the ovary.
Now actually looking, it's

412
00:35:50 --> 00:35:54
interesting that there's a female
birth control pill,

413
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
because really, there are certainly
targets in the male for birth

414
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
control pills,
but these have not yet been

415
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
exploited.
But the notion is that you exploit

416
00:36:06 --> 00:36:11
this feedback loop,
and its well-enough understood that

417
00:36:11 --> 00:36:17
you can.  OK, so let me move on to
talking about the process of

418
00:36:17 --> 00:36:24
fertilization, per say.

419
00:36:24 --> 00:36:28
The process of fertilization
involves the egg and the sperm

420
00:36:28 --> 00:36:32
coming together,
and recognizing one another as being

421
00:36:32 --> 00:36:37
from the same species.  This
is very important --

422
00:36:37 --> 00:36:46
-- very important that you get

423
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
species-specific recognition,
in order that you get correct

424
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
transmission of genetic material.
So the first thing that we mention

425
00:36:54 --> 00:37:03
is sperm-egg recognition --

426
00:37:03 --> 00:37:07
-- and this has many levels.
In some animals, the egg, or the

427
00:37:07 --> 00:37:12
uterus, or the female sends out
various chemo attractants to

428
00:37:12 --> 00:37:17
attractants, to encourage the sperm
to get to the egg.

429
00:37:17 --> 00:37:22
Some of these have been isolated,
and there are small peptides, for

430
00:37:22 --> 00:37:27
example, sea urchins,
which are the organism that have

431
00:37:27 --> 00:37:31
been used to study fertilization.
Most have very small peptides,

432
00:37:31 --> 00:37:35
or the chemo attractants, in humans
there is some data that there may be

433
00:37:35 --> 00:37:39
chemo attractants released by the
oviduct that causes the sperm to

434
00:37:39 --> 00:37:43
swim in a directed fashion,
but it's very interesting that they

435
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
can't be that powerful,
those chemo attractants,

436
00:37:47 --> 00:37:50
because one needs so many sperm to
be released in order to fertilize

437
00:37:50 --> 00:37:54
the egg.  And it's very interesting
that although there are five times

438
00:37:54 --> 00:37:58
ten to the seventh,
or more, spermatozoa in a human

439
00:37:58 --> 00:38:02
ejaculate, if you actually look in
the region of the oviduct,

440
00:38:02 --> 00:38:06
where fertilization would take place,
you only find a few hundred

441
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
sperm there.
So most of them disappear on the way,

442
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
and so if there are chemo
attractants, I say they're not very

443
00:38:14 --> 00:38:18
good ones.  OK,
another process that is very

444
00:38:18 --> 00:38:23
important in mammals,
is something called capacitation.

445
00:38:23 --> 00:38:27
The sperm, as I told you, have this
capacity to be motile,

446
00:38:27 --> 00:38:31
that they contain a lot of energy
stores, or they contain mitochondria

447
00:38:31 --> 00:38:36
that can convert energy
to movement.

448
00:38:36 --> 00:38:42
But they save that energy for a time
when they think they might be in the

449
00:38:42 --> 00:38:48
vicinity of an egg,
and when sperm are exposed to fluid

450
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
from a mammalian oviduct,
they undergo an increase in motility,

451
00:38:54 --> 00:39:01
so capacitation leads to an increase
in sperm motility.

452
00:39:01 --> 00:39:07
This process is mediated by some
kind of signal transduction

453
00:39:07 --> 00:39:13
mechanism, that involves the second
messenger, cyclic AMP that you

454
00:39:13 --> 00:39:20
discussed with Professor Jacks,
and this is very important.

455
00:39:20 --> 00:39:24
If capacitation doesn't occur,
fertilization doesn't occur either.

456
00:39:24 --> 00:39:29
OK, so once the sperm are in the
vicinity of the egg,

457
00:39:29 --> 00:39:34
they then have the challenge of
fusing with it.

458
00:39:34 --> 00:39:38
This is an animation I showed you
previously, of a sperm moving

459
00:39:38 --> 00:39:43
towards an egg.
Now this is a mammalian egg,

460
00:39:43 --> 00:39:48
and it's surrounded by a bunch of
stuff.  It's surrounded by these

461
00:39:48 --> 00:39:52
circly things,
which are cells that released from

462
00:39:52 --> 00:39:57
the ovary, along with the egg,
and it's surrounded by a number of

463
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
so-called membranes.
The most important one of which is

464
00:40:01 --> 00:40:05
called the zona pellucida,
and as the sperm goes towards the

465
00:40:05 --> 00:40:09
egg, and approaches the egg,
it has to burrow its way through a

466
00:40:09 --> 00:40:13
bunch of membranes to get there,
this animation doesn't finish

467
00:40:13 --> 00:40:16
fertilization clearly.
OK, so if you look at a mammalian

468
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
egg at fertilization,
there is the egg per-say,

469
00:40:20 --> 00:40:24
that is a cell surrounded by a
plasma membrane,

470
00:40:24 --> 00:40:28
and then there's this thick,
yellow layer, that's called the zona

471
00:40:28 --> 00:40:32
pellucida.
Around that, is this layer of cells

472
00:40:32 --> 00:40:37
called the cumulus,
and the sperm have to borrow through

473
00:40:37 --> 00:40:42
both the cumulus layer,
and particularly the zona pellucida,

474
00:40:42 --> 00:40:47
before they get to the plasma
membrane, and before they can then

475
00:40:47 --> 00:40:52
try to fuse with the plasma membrane,
and enter the egg.

476
00:40:52 --> 00:40:57
So, the second thing that we need
to think about is contact,

477
00:40:57 --> 00:41:02
and there's two steps to this.
The first contact and they're

478
00:41:02 --> 00:41:07
actually very interesting steps
because there's a bunch of

479
00:41:07 --> 00:41:13
reciprocal interaction,
and reciprocal receptor ligand

480
00:41:13 --> 00:41:18
interaction.  The first interaction
is between the sperm,

481
00:41:18 --> 00:41:23
which provides a receptor,
and the egg, and this layer called

482
00:41:23 --> 00:41:29
the zona pellucida around the egg,
and the zona provides the ligands

483
00:41:29 --> 00:41:34
for the interaction.
And it turns out that the zona

484
00:41:34 --> 00:41:40
pellucida, although it's called a
membrane very often,

485
00:41:40 --> 00:41:46
is not a lipid by-layer,
it's a glycol-protein layer,

486
00:41:46 --> 00:41:51
OK?  And the proteins in the zona
are called zp1,

487
00:41:51 --> 00:41:57
zp2, and zp3, and they form a very
complex meshwork of

488
00:41:57 --> 00:42:02
glycol-proteins.
The sperm receptor in mammals

489
00:42:02 --> 00:42:06
recognizes a protein called zp3 in
the zona, and then subsequently,

490
00:42:06 --> 00:42:11
there's a shift in carbohydrate
arrangement of the zona proteins,

491
00:42:11 --> 00:42:16
and it then recognizes something
called zp2.  Now,

492
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
this receptor-ligand interaction has
a very interesting consequence.

493
00:42:20 --> 00:42:25
It leads to activation of second
messengers, it goes through a system

494
00:42:25 --> 00:42:30
of proteins called G proteins,
but what was most important is that

495
00:42:30 --> 00:42:35
it leads to the release of calcium
within the sperm.

496
00:42:35 --> 00:42:41
And this calcium,
let me move the calcium here,

497
00:42:41 --> 00:42:47
so this leads to the release of
calcium with the sperm,

498
00:42:47 --> 00:42:53
and this causes something called the
acrosome reaction.

499
00:42:53 --> 00:42:59
Now the acrosome, as I said,
derives from the Golgi, and it is

500
00:42:59 --> 00:43:06
filled with Golgi-derived proteins,
particularly proteases.

501
00:43:06 --> 00:43:11
Upon the acrosome reaction,
there is a massive exocytosis of the

502
00:43:11 --> 00:43:17
acrosomal contents,
to release proteases,

503
00:43:17 --> 00:43:23
and these proteases digest the zona.
All right, some diagrams.  This is

504
00:43:23 --> 00:43:28
a diagram you have on your handout.
Here is the sperm moving through

505
00:43:28 --> 00:43:34
the cumulus layer,
getting through the zona,

506
00:43:34 --> 00:43:40
at contact there is a reaction,
such that the acrosome releases its

507
00:43:40 --> 00:43:46
contents, and the next
step can happen.

508
00:43:46 --> 00:43:51
This is a movie of the acrosome
reaction from the horseshoe crab,

509
00:43:51 --> 00:43:56
limulus, it has an extraordinary
acrosome.  The acrosome in limulus

510
00:43:56 --> 00:44:01
compromises acrosomal protein,
the proteases, but a lot of

511
00:44:01 --> 00:44:06
unpolymerized,
and upon contact with the limulus

512
00:44:06 --> 00:44:11
egg, the, let me stop this so you
can watch it while I'm telling

513
00:44:11 --> 00:44:16
you about it.
The actin that is in the acrosome

514
00:44:16 --> 00:44:21
polymerizes, this is a matter of
seconds, and sends out this

515
00:44:21 --> 00:44:26
incredibly long process,
here it comes, look at this.

516
00:44:26 --> 00:44:30
See this thing shooting out?
That is a polymer of actin that is

517
00:44:30 --> 00:44:35
coated with these acrosomal
proteases.  So this is the sperm

518
00:44:35 --> 00:44:40
head, and so it's shooting out this
process that is many,

519
00:44:40 --> 00:44:45
many times longer than the sperm
head, and it's allowing it to get

520
00:44:45 --> 00:44:50
into the limulus egg.
Mammalian sperm do not have such a

521
00:44:50 --> 00:44:55
spectacular acrosome reaction,
but they do have one that serves the

522
00:44:55 --> 00:45:00
same purpose.  OK,
all right, so the next thing that is

523
00:45:00 --> 00:45:05
going to happen is that there is a
second reciprocal interaction,

524
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
and this time, the egg is going to
provide the receptor,

525
00:45:10 --> 00:45:16
and the sperm is going to provide
the ligand.

526
00:45:16 --> 00:45:22
So, we now have the sperm,
whose acrosomal membrane that had

527
00:45:22 --> 00:45:29
been the Golgi membrane,
is now exposed, and is covered with

528
00:45:29 --> 00:45:36
ligands, so the acrosome,
the acrosome membrane, is covered

529
00:45:36 --> 00:45:42
with ligand.
This interacts with receptors on the

530
00:45:42 --> 00:45:48
egg plasma membrane,
and there is, as a result of this

531
00:45:48 --> 00:45:54
receptor-ligand interaction,
the activation of a

532
00:45:54 --> 00:46:00
signal-transduction system,
and the signal transduction system

533
00:46:00 --> 00:46:05
does two things,
so there is this interaction leads

534
00:46:05 --> 00:46:11
within the egg,
to activation of signal transduction,

535
00:46:11 --> 00:46:17
that has the effect,
eventually, of releasing calcium

536
00:46:17 --> 00:46:23
with the egg.  And this calcium
released within the egg

537
00:46:23 --> 00:46:28
does two things.
The first thing that it does is to

538
00:46:28 --> 00:46:33
prevent any additional sperm from
entering the egg,

539
00:46:33 --> 00:46:38
and I'll tell you about this in a
second.  So it blocks,

540
00:46:38 --> 00:46:43
or activates the block,
to polyspermy, and in particular it

541
00:46:43 --> 00:46:48
activates the so-called slow block
to polyspermy,

542
00:46:48 --> 00:46:53
and it also activates,
a little while later, the zygote,

543
00:46:53 --> 00:46:58
to begin dividing, to enter the cell
cycle, and to begin various other

544
00:46:58 --> 00:47:04
processes required in
the early embryo.

545
00:47:04 --> 00:47:10
So cell cycle entry of the zygote.
All right, so let's look at a movie

546
00:47:10 --> 00:47:17
of the sperm entering the egg.
OK, here is, I'll show you this

547
00:47:17 --> 00:47:23
again.  Here is the sperm,
its tale is sticking out, there,

548
00:47:23 --> 00:47:30
it's going right into the egg.  The
cell membrane reciprocates,

549
00:47:30 --> 00:47:36
and buckles, and in some organisms,
it engulfs the sperm as it's going

550
00:47:36 --> 00:47:43
in, but the actual sense in most
organisms, the membranes either fuse,

551
00:47:43 --> 00:47:50
or somehow you get the whole sperm
being pushed into the egg.

552
00:47:50 --> 00:47:55
In most animals the sperm membrane
doesn't actually enter the egg,

553
00:47:55 --> 00:48:01
but in some animals it does, and in
some cases it doesn't seem to matter.

554
00:48:01 --> 00:48:07
OK, what is this block to
polyspermy?  This is something that

555
00:48:07 --> 00:48:13
happens in the first 30 seconds
after fertilization,

556
00:48:13 --> 00:48:19
and it involves exocytosis of a set
of granules called the cortical

557
00:48:19 --> 00:48:25
granules, that contain enzymes,
that do two things.

558
00:48:25 --> 00:48:28
These enzymes firstly,
when they are released,

559
00:48:28 --> 00:48:32
break apart junctions between the
outer membranes,

560
00:48:32 --> 00:48:36
in this case, this is shown in frogs.
The outer membrane in frogs is

561
00:48:36 --> 00:48:40
called the vitelline envelope,
its equivalent to the zona pellucida

562
00:48:40 --> 00:48:44
in mammals.  And before
fertilization,

563
00:48:44 --> 00:48:48
this outer envelope is tethered by
proteins, to the plasma membrane,

564
00:48:48 --> 00:48:52
so they're very closely opposed.
At the release of the cortical

565
00:48:52 --> 00:48:56
granules, these protein contacts are
broken, and the fertilization

566
00:48:56 --> 00:49:00
envelope lifts off the surface of
the egg.  A number of other things

567
00:49:00 --> 00:49:05
happen, as well.
In mammals the zona pellucida is

568
00:49:05 --> 00:49:09
completely remodeled,
so it no longer binds with the sperm,

569
00:49:09 --> 00:49:13
the carbohydrates are stripped off
the zona proteins so that they no

570
00:49:13 --> 00:49:18
longer bind sperm.
This is a movie of the block to

571
00:49:18 --> 00:49:23
polyspermy, or the consequence of
the block to polyspermy in the frog.

572
00:49:23 --> 00:49:28
Here is the frog egg.  At
fertilization,

573
00:49:28 --> 00:49:33
watch carefully,
you can see there is a big halo that

574
00:49:33 --> 00:49:38
arises above the frog egg,
there it is, and this is a

575
00:49:38 --> 00:49:43
consequence of cortical granule
exocytosis, and the blocked

576
00:49:43 --> 00:49:48
polyspermy.
OK.  OK.  Before you go,

577
00:49:48 --> 00:49:51
what I did not cover in lecture
today, don't go for one second.
