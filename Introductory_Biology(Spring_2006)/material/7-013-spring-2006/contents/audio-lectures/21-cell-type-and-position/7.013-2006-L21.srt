1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
What we talked about last time was
formation of different types of

2
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
cells in the embryo,
different positions, different

3
00:00:27 --> 00:00:33
shapes.  Am I on?
And we talked about one of the

4
00:00:33 --> 00:00:39
overriding principles of all of this
being the control of gene expression.

5
00:00:39 --> 00:00:45
I'll explore this a little more
with a couple of slides in a moment.

6
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
Let me just write some points.  So
we talked about the control of gene

7
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
expression as being an overriding
principle of how cells

8
00:00:57 --> 00:01:03
types are formed.
We talked about the fact that cell

9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
types were formed in a stepwise
fashion.  And different parts of the

10
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
embryo indeed in a stepwise fashion.
Not all at once.  And we talked

11
00:01:13 --> 00:01:23
about a combinatorial code --

12
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
-- of regulators that,
together, specify different types of

13
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
cells.
So here we are to remind you talking

14
00:01:32 --> 00:01:37
about cell type in the formation
module stepping through our board of

15
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
life.  And here are a couple of
slides to remind you what we talked

16
00:01:42 --> 00:01:47
about in last lecture to bring you
up to speed.  You should look at the

17
00:01:47 --> 00:01:52
PowerPoint on the Web if you have
not already.  Cell type is defined

18
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
by the proteins a particular
cell makes.

19
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
For example, red blood cells carry
oxygen around the body because they

20
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
make globin which is able to carry
oxygen.  The set of proteins that

21
00:02:08 --> 00:02:13
are made are defined by which genes
in a cell are active,

22
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
or expressed is the term you should
know.  And, therefore,

23
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
which genes are active,
also called the control of gene

24
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
expression, controls which
cell type forms.

25
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
This triad is essential for you to
understand what we're going to be

26
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
talking about now and really for the
rest of the course.

27
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
So you should really get it.
If you don't see me, go back and

28
00:02:41 --> 00:02:46
look at the previous lecture.
And this lecture is going to also

29
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
reinforce this triad.
I pointed out last time that gene

30
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
expression can be controlled
at many levels.

31
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
In fact, at any point from
transcription,

32
00:02:59 --> 00:03:04
even from replication actually of
the DNA through transcription,

33
00:03:04 --> 00:03:09
splicing, translation, export of the
RNA to the cytoplasm,

34
00:03:09 --> 00:03:13
I haven't written up here,
messenger RNA stability, protein

35
00:03:13 --> 00:03:18
modification, protein export.
Any of these steps is along the way

36
00:03:18 --> 00:03:23
to getting the final gene product.
And any of these steps can be

37
00:03:23 --> 00:03:28
controlled to allow the readout of
the final gene product or not.

38
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
I told you that along the way to
becoming the final type of cell that

39
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
a cell is going to become,
it goes through a couple of steps.

40
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
Or it can go through many steps,
and we'll talk about that

41
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
extensively today.
Cells begin as uncommitted or naive.

42
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
They don't know what they're going
to become.  They then become

43
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
committed or determined to a
particular fate,

44
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
a position or a structure,
but they may not look very different

45
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
from that first set of
uncommitted cells.

46
00:03:58 --> 00:04:03
And then they go on eventually to
form so-called differentiated cells

47
00:04:03 --> 00:04:09
or the final cell type which has the
function of that particular cell

48
00:04:09 --> 00:04:14
type.  And so the point is if there
is a stepwise formation of the final

49
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
cell type.  And that final cell type
is directed through the action of

50
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
regulatory factors that we termed
inducers or determinants.

51
00:04:26 --> 00:04:31
There is nothing magic about these.
Inducers referred to factors that

52
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
were involved in cell-cell signaling.
Determinants referred to regulatory

53
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
factors that acted within a cell and
were inherited by it.

54
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
You shouldn't be trying to write
all this down now actually because

55
00:04:44 --> 00:04:49
this is really review.
And if you weren't at the last

56
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
lecture, try to get some of it to
wash over you and then go back and

57
00:04:53 --> 00:04:58
make sure you really
know this stuff.

58
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
And then as the differentiated cells
form there is activation of a set of

59
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
genes called differentiation genes
which are the things that carry out

60
00:05:06 --> 00:05:11
the final cell function,
the globin protein in red blood

61
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
cells, the neurofilaments and
neurotransmitters in neurons and so

62
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
on.  And we'll talk about this again
as we go through today.

63
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
OK.  So this is not unrelated to
what we are going to

64
00:05:24 --> 00:05:29
talk about today.
Because what I want to do today is

65
00:05:29 --> 00:05:35
to explore with you how you get a
particular kind of cell.

66
00:05:35 --> 00:05:41
And I want to use that exploration
to underline some of the principles

67
00:05:41 --> 00:05:46
that I haven't yet covered as to how
cell type is determined in the

68
00:05:46 --> 00:05:52
embryo.  And the cell type I'm going
to talk to you about is skeletal

69
00:05:52 --> 00:05:58
muscle.  No, this is not
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

70
00:05:58 --> 00:06:20
OK.  So the point today is to look

71
00:06:20 --> 00:06:26
at a particular cell type and how it
forms.  The type we've chosen is

72
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
skeletal muscle.
Skeletal muscle is one of three

73
00:06:32 --> 00:06:38
kinds of muscle in your body.
The other two being cardiac in your

74
00:06:38 --> 00:06:43
heart and smooth muscle around your
internal organs.

75
00:06:43 --> 00:06:48
Skeletal muscle acts in a voluntary
fashion to allow movement.

76
00:06:48 --> 00:06:54
It's an extremely complex structure.
The final form of skeletal muscle

77
00:06:54 --> 00:06:59
includes 200 proteins which have the
extraordinary property of

78
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
contractility in response
to nerve input.

79
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
I'm not going to talk about the
contractile process,

80
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
although it's fascinating.
And you're not going to be tested

81
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
on this for the physiology of
contractility either.

82
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
But if you're interested in this,
I would suggest you look at Chapter

83
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
47 in your book which talks about
this quite nicely.

84
00:07:25 --> 00:07:31
Skeletal muscles are arranged in
large groups of fibers.

85
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
And each muscle fiber is a
multinucleate cell,

86
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
is a giant cell that consists of
many myofibrils or myofibrils that

87
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
are together in a sheath and are
surrounded by many nuclei.

88
00:07:49 --> 00:07:55
So skeletal muscle forms from the
fusion of many mononucleate cells to

89
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
give a multinucleate syncytium.
And during the process of skeletal

90
00:08:00 --> 00:08:05
muscle formation there are a number
of steps that one can delineate.

91
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
One can talk about a kind of cell
called a myoblast which is a single

92
00:08:11 --> 00:08:20
mononucleate cell --

93
00:08:20 --> 00:08:30
-- that then fuses to form,
through many steps, something called

94
00:08:30 --> 00:08:37
a myotube which is multinucleate.
And these various myotubes come

95
00:08:37 --> 00:08:43
together to eventually
form a muscle fiber.

96
00:08:43 --> 00:08:48
Muscle is obviously an extremely

97
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
important cell type for movement.
All of the meat that you eat, if

98
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
you're a meat eater,
is muscle, essentially a skeletal

99
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
muscle.  And there are many diseases
that are associated with abnormal

100
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
skeletal muscle.
Muscular dystrophy,

101
00:09:05 --> 00:09:11
for example, is a deficit of one
particular protein in the muscle,

102
00:09:11 --> 00:09:17
affects one in about 3,000 boys.  OK.
So the myofibril is a very

103
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
beautiful construction of many
proteins organized in a very ordered

104
00:09:23 --> 00:09:29
structure.  And the deal is that
these proteins slide relative to one

105
00:09:29 --> 00:09:34
another during contractility.
And all of these bands of proteins

106
00:09:34 --> 00:09:40
slide in an ordered fashion relative
to one another as the muscle

107
00:09:40 --> 00:09:45
contracts.  It's an extraordinary
story in physiology itself.

108
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
And I regret I don't have time to
go through it with you.

109
00:09:51 --> 00:09:56
But I want to use this rather as an
example of a cell type and to

110
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
explore with you how the cell type
forms during development.

111
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
So the story I'm going to tell you
has to do with a particular

112
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
transcription factor called MyoD.
MyoD, shown in green here, no, not

113
00:10:14 --> 00:10:20
shown in green here.
That's the DNA double helix.

114
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
Shown in red here binds to a
particular sequence on

115
00:10:26 --> 00:10:33
DNA, its target site.
It binds as a dimer.

116
00:10:33 --> 00:10:41
And it acts to activate the
transcription of genes required for

117
00:10:41 --> 00:10:49
muscle formation.
OK.  So MyoD is a transcription

118
00:10:49 --> 00:10:57
factor.  And, as I'll tell you a
moment, it gives rise to the

119
00:10:57 --> 00:11:05
determination of skeletal muscle.
Now, I'm going to tell you a few

120
00:11:05 --> 00:11:11
things about this that are general
principles of how this transcription

121
00:11:11 --> 00:11:17
factor works and then I'll go
through some slides with you.

122
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
MyoD is both necessary, although
I'm going to clarify that in a

123
00:11:23 --> 00:11:30
moment, and sufficient for
muscle determination.

124
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
This is a dyad of words that is very
important, necessary: required for,

125
00:11:34 --> 00:11:39
sufficient: enough to.  And whenever
you're thinking about gene function,

126
00:11:39 --> 00:11:43
this is the dyad you want to think
about.  It may not be a gene,

127
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
and then I'll tell you in a moment.
I'm going to put a caveat here with

128
00:11:48 --> 00:11:53
respect to the necessary,
OK?  But necessary and sufficient is

129
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
one of these litanies that you want
to ask yourself when you're thinking

130
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
about regulatory factors.
The other thing that I want to tell

131
00:12:02 --> 00:12:08
you is that MyoD is a member of a
gene family.  What's a gene family?

132
00:12:08 --> 00:12:13
A gene family is a group of genes
with similar structure and often

133
00:12:13 --> 00:12:19
similar function.
This gene family that MyoD belongs

134
00:12:19 --> 00:12:24
to is called the MRF gene family,
which stands for muscle regulatory

135
00:12:24 --> 00:12:30
family.  And there are
four members.

136
00:12:30 --> 00:12:38
And these members share some

137
00:12:38 --> 00:12:45
function with one another.
And that leads us to another term

138
00:12:45 --> 00:12:52
which is the term redundant.
MyoD is an extremely important gene.

139
00:12:52 --> 00:12:59
And if you make knockouts in mice
there is some phenotype,

140
00:12:59 --> 00:13:06
but they have muscle.
And it's not until you make a gene

141
00:13:06 --> 00:13:13
mutation in another member of the
MRF family that you see mice that

142
00:13:13 --> 00:13:20
don't have any skeletal muscle.
So redundant in this case refers to,

143
00:13:20 --> 00:13:27
or in all cases refers to shared
function.  It can also refer to,

144
00:13:27 --> 00:13:35
and does in this case, it can also
refer to alternate pathways.

145
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
So the notion that we have is that
we're starting here as an

146
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
uncommitted cell and we're going to
end up over there as a

147
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
differentiated muscle cell.
And we can get there by walking

148
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
straight this way,
but we could also get there by

149
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
walking up and out the back and all
the way around and to that same spot

150
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
in front.  And both of those would
be bona fide pathways that would get

151
00:13:59 --> 00:14:04
you from point A to point B.
So sometimes there can be alternate

152
00:14:04 --> 00:14:11
pathways that will get you along the
path of forming particular cell

153
00:14:11 --> 00:14:18
types or even carrying out some kind
of biochemical function.

154
00:14:18 --> 00:14:25
OK?  This is a general principle of
biology.  So let's look at this in a

155
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
bit more detail with some slides.
The notion is that MyoD binds to the

156
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
promoters of many different genes
expressed in skeletal muscle,

157
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
together with other transcription
factors, some of which may be common

158
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
to all of these genes and some of
which may be different.

159
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
And it activates their
transcription.

160
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
And you can see I haven't drawn the
genes in a really accurate way.

161
00:14:51 --> 00:14:55
These are just representations.
There's no double-stranded DNA

162
00:14:55 --> 00:15:00
meant to be implied or
not implied there.

163
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
MyoD is sufficient to activate the
skeletal muscle program.

164
00:15:04 --> 00:15:09
And this is a very exciting finding
about 15 years ago when it was shown

165
00:15:09 --> 00:15:14
that one could take the MyoD gene,
and you actually put it in a virus,

166
00:15:14 --> 00:15:19
and then you can infect a group of
cells that normally wouldn't become

167
00:15:19 --> 00:15:24
muscle with this virus.
And lo and behold the virus that is

168
00:15:24 --> 00:15:29
expressing the MyoD protein will
turn these cells into

169
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
skeletal muscle.
And this was the first example of a

170
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
regulatory protein that could take
one cell type and turn it into

171
00:15:38 --> 00:15:42
another cell type.
And MyoD and the other MRFs are

172
00:15:42 --> 00:15:47
very good at doing this.
They can, for example, take brain

173
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
cells and turn those into muscle.
They can really take most cell

174
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
types and turn them into muscle
cells.  So MyoD is sufficient to

175
00:15:55 --> 00:16:00
convert non-muscle to muscle cells.
And this is actually particularly

176
00:16:00 --> 00:16:05
extraordinary because,
as I showed you in a one line

177
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
schematic on this board,
forming skeletal muscle is a

178
00:16:09 --> 00:16:14
multi-step program.
You start off with these cells

179
00:16:14 --> 00:16:19
called, they call them myotome cells,
and then you get these things called

180
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
myoblasts which are dividing.
The myoblasts start to align in

181
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
arrays.  And then the cells fuse
with one another,

182
00:16:28 --> 00:16:33
which is really unusual for cells.
I mean it's a really kind of weird

183
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
cell type.  And you get these long
tubes that have got thousands of

184
00:16:37 --> 00:16:42
nuclei in them.
And then the tubes start to make

185
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
proteins that align themselves in
these very ordered ways that allow

186
00:16:46 --> 00:16:51
them to slide relative to one
another, and you get this

187
00:16:51 --> 00:16:56
multinucleate myotube that has
contractile function.

188
00:16:56 --> 00:17:00
And what's really cool about MyoD is
that it can start this whole process

189
00:17:00 --> 00:17:05
which then follows one step after
another.  So it's been termed a

190
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
master regulatory switch because it
can activate a whole cell

191
00:17:09 --> 00:17:17
type specific program.

192
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
Now, in contrast,
and this is what I was alluding to

193
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
on the board, knockout or removal,
a genetic mutation of MyoD does not

194
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
remove skeletal muscle from mice.
So this is a micrograph of muscle.

195
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
You can see the ordered myotubes
from a wild type mouse.

196
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
This is a MyoD null mouse.
And there's perfectly fine skeletal

197
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
muscle there.  It's a little,
there's a little less of it, but

198
00:17:42 --> 00:17:47
it's still there and the mouse is
viable.  However,

199
00:17:47 --> 00:17:51
if you go in and you make a double
mutation in the MyoD gene and

200
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
another member of the family called
Mif5, there is no muscle at all in

201
00:17:55 --> 00:18:00
any region, or no skeletal muscle at
all in any region of the body.

202
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
The other muscle,
the heart muscle and the muscle

203
00:18:03 --> 00:18:07
around the intestine,
the smooth muscle is fine,

204
00:18:07 --> 00:18:11
but the skeletal muscle is
completely absent.

205
00:18:11 --> 00:18:15
So we can say that the MRFs are
necessary for muscle formation but

206
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
that MyoD is a member of a redundant
gene family.  And that seems to be

207
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
the rule in biology,
that genes come in families,

208
00:18:22 --> 00:18:26
and very often one can take over the
function of another when one of them

209
00:18:26 --> 00:18:30
is mutated.  And that serves as a
kind of fail-safe for making sure

210
00:18:30 --> 00:18:37
that development works properly.

211
00:18:37 --> 00:18:42
OK.  So here comes something to
think about that I alluded to before

212
00:18:42 --> 00:18:48
spring break.  I remember this.
Don't know if you do.  MyoD is,

213
00:18:48 --> 00:18:53
in the entire embryo the MyoD gene
is only expressed in the future

214
00:18:53 --> 00:18:59
skeletal muscle.
This is a picture of a frog embryo.

215
00:18:59 --> 00:19:03
And you can see these stripes along
the back of the frog.

216
00:19:03 --> 00:19:07
These are regions of the embryo
called the myotones.

217
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
They're part of the somites that
I'll talk about.

218
00:19:11 --> 00:19:15
And this is what's going to become
the future skeletal muscle.

219
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
And this is where MyoD is expressed.
And, brilliant,

220
00:19:19 --> 00:19:23
only there.  And now this is a
chicken embryo and you see the same

221
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
thing.  MyoD is expressed in these
stripes along the back in the future

222
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
myotones of the somites.
It's also expressed in the future

223
00:19:31 --> 00:19:35
limbs as the muscle of the limbs is
starting to form.

224
00:19:35 --> 00:19:39
And so you're going to ask me,
or you should, how does MyoD get

225
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
activated just in the future
skeletal muscle?

226
00:19:43 --> 00:19:47
Because in a way this is a copout.
I've told you MyoD activates the

227
00:19:47 --> 00:19:51
skeletal muscle program,
and it's only expressed in cells

228
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
that are future skeletal muscle.
Well, how does it know to be

229
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
expressed just in this one
region of the embryo?

230
00:20:00 --> 00:20:05
And to answer that question we have
to actually go back to the dawn of

231
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
time to fertilization.
And I'm going to take you through

232
00:20:10 --> 00:20:16
some of the steps that will get MyoD
expression into this particular

233
00:20:16 --> 00:20:21
pattern that will allow the skeletal
muscle to grow out in just the right

234
00:20:21 --> 00:20:27
places of the embryo to give just
the right amount and the right

235
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
position of skeletal muscle.
OK.  So.  And to do that we are

236
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
going to pose some questions.
And I'm going to start by telling

237
00:20:37 --> 00:20:42
you something and then pose a
question.  If you look at an embryo,

238
00:20:42 --> 00:20:48
you could look back at that chick
one if you wanted to do or you can

239
00:20:48 --> 00:20:53
look at this fish.
Here is your fish fillet,

240
00:20:53 --> 00:20:58
your skeletal muscle, and it is on
the so-called dorsal or backside

241
00:20:58 --> 00:21:03
of the embryo.
So last time we talked about dorsal

242
00:21:03 --> 00:21:08
and ventral as two of the so-called
axis or positional coordinates in

243
00:21:08 --> 00:21:13
the embryo.  And the muscle arises
from a region that is termed dorsal

244
00:21:13 --> 00:21:18
which is the back.
OK?  So you might ask me,

245
00:21:18 --> 00:21:23
how do you know this?  And I'll tell
you how I know this.

246
00:21:23 --> 00:21:28
You should ask me how do I know
this.  OK, so I'm going to.

247
00:21:28 --> 00:21:33
Having put questions into your
mouths, I'm going to tell you how

248
00:21:33 --> 00:21:39
you know during the development of
an organism where a particular cell

249
00:21:39 --> 00:21:45
type is going to arise from.
And the technique I'm going to tell

250
00:21:45 --> 00:21:51
you about is something called fate
mapping.  So let's begin with the

251
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
sentence muscle,
and I'm talking about skeletal

252
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
muscle when I write muscle,
arises from the dorsal or the back

253
00:22:03 --> 00:22:08
of the embryo.
OK?  And so how do you know this?

254
00:22:08 --> 00:22:14
How is this known?  And it's known
through use of a technique called

255
00:22:14 --> 00:22:20
fate mapping.  What is fate mapping?
So this is very interesting.  The

256
00:22:20 --> 00:22:25
idea is to take a very early embryo,
I've shown you here a fish embryo,

257
00:22:25 --> 00:22:31
and to inject one or a few of its
cells that you can distinguish by

258
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
some kind of morphological,
obvious indicator from the rest of

259
00:22:37 --> 00:22:42
the embryo.
And to inject those cells with a dye.

260
00:22:42 --> 00:22:47
So here we've used a fluorescent
dye.  And we've put that dye near

261
00:22:47 --> 00:22:52
the site of the embryo that's got
this bump.  OK?

262
00:22:52 --> 00:22:57
And as the embryo develops the
cells will inherit that dye because

263
00:22:57 --> 00:23:02
it's a non-diffusible dye.
And that dye will be inherited.

264
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
And in the later fish, we're
looking down now onto its brain,

265
00:23:07 --> 00:23:12
you can see that the whole front of
the brain is outlined with these

266
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
green fluorescent cells.
And what this tells you is that the

267
00:23:16 --> 00:23:21
cell you injected initially has gone
on to give rise to this whole front

268
00:23:21 --> 00:23:26
region of the brain.
OK?  So fate mapping tells you what

269
00:23:26 --> 00:23:37
cells will become.

270
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
All right.  I know it's on the slide,
but it's important that you

271
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
understand this because it is
distinguished from something I'm

272
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
going to tell you later.
So you can do this for skeletal

273
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
muscle.  And I'm going to talk about
frog development because so much is

274
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
known.  So here is a frog at the 32
cell stage.  And one can see,

275
00:23:57 --> 00:24:01
because of the size of the cells and
because of pigmentation differences

276
00:24:01 --> 00:24:05
I'll show you in a moment,
which side of the embryo is what.

277
00:24:05 --> 00:24:09
And I've injected a cell here that's
called the C3 cell,

278
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
all these cells have got different
names, with dye.

279
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
And later on you can see,
in this thought experiment,

280
00:24:17 --> 00:24:21
that the somites are labeled with
the blue dye.  So the C3 cell,

281
00:24:21 --> 00:24:25
and actually the one on the other
side of embryo,

282
00:24:25 --> 00:24:30
are going to give rise to skeletal
muscle.  OK.

283
00:24:30 --> 00:24:34
So the reason that I wrote on the
board what was on the slide already

284
00:24:34 --> 00:24:39
is that it's really important to
distinguish what cells are going to

285
00:24:39 --> 00:24:43
become from when they've made the
decision to become it.

286
00:24:43 --> 00:24:48
So the next thing we want to know
is when cells decide what they're

287
00:24:48 --> 00:24:52
going to become.
And I can rephrase that by saying

288
00:24:52 --> 00:25:01
when is the fate decision made?

289
00:25:01 --> 00:25:06
And fate mapping doesn't tell you
that.  All it tells you is what a

290
00:25:06 --> 00:25:12
cell is going to become,
not when the cell has decided to

291
00:25:12 --> 00:25:18
become that thing.
For this you have to do some other

292
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
assay, and you do assays that are
generally called determination

293
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
assays.  And I'll show you an
example of one such assay.

294
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
So here's our 32 cell stage frog
embryo again with the C3 cell

295
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38
labeled.  And one can go into the
embryo and dissect out that cell.

296
00:25:38 --> 00:25:42
Frog embryos are about a millimeter
in diameter.  And you can use very

297
00:25:42 --> 00:25:47
fine glass needles to tease out that
cell from the embryo.

298
00:25:47 --> 00:25:51
And you can grow it in a very
simple culture method with just some

299
00:25:51 --> 00:25:55
saline solution and the cell will
grow fine and divide.

300
00:25:55 --> 00:26:00
And you can ask whether that cell
goes on to make skeletal muscle.

301
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
OK?  Does it know that it's going to
be skeletal muscle?

302
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
And the answer at this stage of
development is no,

303
00:26:08 --> 00:26:13
it doesn't.  So if you remove the
cell, grow it in culture,

304
00:26:13 --> 00:26:17
it goes on to become these things
called fibroblasts which are cells

305
00:26:17 --> 00:26:21
that spread out in the dish.
They don't fuse.  They don't make

306
00:26:21 --> 00:26:26
all these muscle proteins.
And so the cell, although it's

307
00:26:26 --> 00:26:30
destined to become muscle,
has not yet made the decision to

308
00:26:30 --> 00:26:35
take that leap of fate.
However, if you wait a few hours,

309
00:26:35 --> 00:26:40
and we're actually on your handouts
now.  If you wait a few hours and

310
00:26:40 --> 00:26:45
you go and you remove the cells that
have arisen from C3,

311
00:26:45 --> 00:26:50
which are divided now.
They're still labeled and you can

312
00:26:50 --> 00:26:55
distinguish them because it's a very
powerful dye and doesn't diffuse.

313
00:26:55 --> 00:27:01
So you can remove that same group
of cells a bit later.

314
00:27:01 --> 00:27:06
And you can then grow those cells in
a culture, in a simple saline

315
00:27:06 --> 00:27:11
solution.  And lo and behold they go
on, after some hours,

316
00:27:11 --> 00:27:16
and form multinucleate myotubes.
They go on to form muscle.  So

317
00:27:16 --> 00:27:22
somewhere between the 32 cell stage
and the stage of a much older embryo

318
00:27:22 --> 00:27:27
of many hundreds of cells,
the cells have made the decision to

319
00:27:27 --> 00:27:32
go onto their particular fate.
So something has changed in terms of

320
00:27:32 --> 00:27:36
the regulatory genes that they're
expressing, presumably,

321
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
that allow them to go and become
muscle.  OK.

322
00:27:40 --> 00:27:56
So let's break this

323
00:27:56 --> 00:28:02
down a bit more.
And let's ask the question,

324
00:28:02 --> 00:28:07
as to what inputs are required to
turning on MyoD activation in a more

325
00:28:07 --> 00:28:11
defined sense?
And the first thing I'm going to

326
00:28:11 --> 00:28:16
talk about is how the embryo knows
where dorsal is.  OK?  So

327
00:28:16 --> 00:28:25
dorsal determination.

328
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
And what I'm going to tell you is a
very interesting tale of

329
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
determinants, of cell autonomous
regulatory factors that are

330
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
specifically required to tell the
embryo where the future dorsal or

331
00:28:38 --> 00:28:43
backside of the embryo
is going to be.

332
00:28:43 --> 00:28:48
And I'll tell you that these
determinants act to stabilize a

333
00:28:48 --> 00:28:54
particular protein that is a
transcription factor,

334
00:28:54 --> 00:29:00
and this protein is called
beta-catenin.

335
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
And beta-catenin,
once it's stabilized,

336
00:29:06 --> 00:29:13
so it is a transcription factor,
goes on to activate a set of genes

337
00:29:13 --> 00:29:20
that are dorsal specific genes,
but not MyoD.  We're not there yet.

338
00:29:20 --> 00:29:37
Gene.  G.  I cannot spell, can I?

339
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
OK.  So let's discuss this using
your handouts.

340
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
This is a movie that I was showing
you at the beginning.

341
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
Woops.  Let's show it to you again
because I want to point

342
00:29:50 --> 00:29:57
something out.

343
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
All right.  This is a four cell
embryo.  Maybe it's going to be an

344
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
eight cell embryo.
Do you see how these embryos have

345
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
got some, two cells that are kind of
darkly pigmented and two cells that

346
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
are lightly pigmented?
Yeah?  The lightly pigmented cells

347
00:30:12 --> 00:30:15
are the ones that are going to be
the future dorsal site of the embryo.

348
00:30:15 --> 00:30:19
OK?  That's where the muscle is
going to come from.

349
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23
And these cells on the other side,
on the ventral side of the embryo,

350
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
that's where the belly is
going to come from.

351
00:30:27 --> 00:30:32
Now, how does this happen?
Well, it happens, and I've

352
00:30:32 --> 00:30:38
augmented the diagram on one of your
handouts a bit so you'll have to add

353
00:30:38 --> 00:30:44
a circle.  It happens because of
movement of these purple dorsal

354
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
determinants.  And these purple
dorsal determinants,

355
00:30:50 --> 00:30:56
as I'll show you, move within the
newly fertilized embryo.

356
00:30:56 --> 00:31:01
In fact, within about 16 minutes
after fertilization these dorsal

357
00:31:01 --> 00:31:06
determinants have moved in the
embryo and have told the embryo

358
00:31:06 --> 00:31:11
where the future dorsal side is
going to be.  And the way they move

359
00:31:11 --> 00:31:16
is that, in fact,
the early egg and the zygote consist

360
00:31:16 --> 00:31:21
of two kinds of cytoplasm,
an outer sphere of cytoplasm that's

361
00:31:21 --> 00:31:26
kind of gelatinous and an inner
sphere of cytoplasm that

362
00:31:26 --> 00:31:31
is more liquid.
And in this outer gelatinous

363
00:31:31 --> 00:31:35
cytoplasm sit these purple
determinants.  And when

364
00:31:35 --> 00:31:40
fertilization takes place these move
by a good angle,

365
00:31:40 --> 00:31:44
at least 30 degrees relative to
where they were,

366
00:31:44 --> 00:31:48
and relative to this inner liquid
cytoplasm, which is why I've got

367
00:31:48 --> 00:31:53
this doted equator there to indicate
that there is a relative movement of

368
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
these determinants.
OK?  It's not the whole embryo

369
00:31:57 --> 00:32:02
that's moving.
It's just part of the embryo that's

370
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
moving relative to the other part.
And this movement of determinants

371
00:32:06 --> 00:32:10
defines the dorsal and the ventral
side of the embryo.

372
00:32:10 --> 00:32:15
OK.  Here's a movie to show you
that.

373
00:32:15 --> 00:32:22
OK.  So this is a movie that is

374
00:32:22 --> 00:32:27
about the first 20 minutes of
fertilization.

375
00:32:27 --> 00:32:32
And you can see here pigment moving
from one region to another region.

376
00:32:32 --> 00:32:35
Now, the pigment is not the
determinants.  It just moves with

377
00:32:35 --> 00:32:39
the determinants.
OK?  So this is an indication that

378
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
there is stuff moving,
actually, from the vegetal pole

379
00:32:43 --> 00:32:47
region up towards this so-called
animal pole region.

380
00:32:47 --> 00:32:51
So the terms animal and vegetal
pole indicate two different sides of

381
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
the radially symmetric egg.
The animal pole is pigmented.

382
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59
The vegetal pole is not.  And
they're just useful landmarks.

383
00:32:59 --> 00:33:03
And, again, this is a frog embryo.
Things may be similar in humans,

384
00:33:03 --> 00:33:07
but we understand much more about
frogs.  So that's why I'm going to

385
00:33:07 --> 00:33:11
tell you how things work in frogs.
OK.  So there is a manifestation of

386
00:33:11 --> 00:33:15
these dorsal determinants moving.
These dorsal determinants move by a

387
00:33:15 --> 00:33:19
really fantastic process.
They move on microtubules.

388
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
Remember microtubules?  What part
of the embryo,

389
00:33:23 --> 00:33:27
what part of the cell were
microtubules part of?

390
00:33:27 --> 00:33:33
Anyone remember?
Dredge back in your memories.

391
00:33:33 --> 00:33:39
I heard something.  Yes?  Thank you.
Cytoskeleton.

392
00:33:39 --> 00:33:45
Yes.  See me for a frog afterward.
So the microtubules are part of the

393
00:33:45 --> 00:33:51
so-called cytoskeleton.
They are large rods of proteins,

394
00:33:51 --> 00:33:57
polymers of proteins.  And when the
sperm enters the egg it brings with

395
00:33:57 --> 00:34:03
it a centriole that is a
microtubular organization center.

396
00:34:03 --> 00:34:07
And what it does,
in this series of three pictures,

397
00:34:07 --> 00:34:12
is to take this mass of red
microtubules that are oriented in

398
00:34:12 --> 00:34:17
every which way,
and it organizes them so they form

399
00:34:17 --> 00:34:21
these beautiful parallel tracks of
microtubules in the outer cytoplasm

400
00:34:21 --> 00:34:26
or between the outer and inner
cytoplasm of the egg or of the

401
00:34:26 --> 00:34:31
zygote, of the fertilized egg.
So the sperm nucleus or the sperm,

402
00:34:31 --> 00:34:36
excuse me, the sperm centriole is
organizing this microtubular array.

403
00:34:36 --> 00:34:41
And it's on these tracks of
microtubules that these determinants

404
00:34:41 --> 00:34:45
move, kind of like train tracks.
And I'll tell you in a moment, it

405
00:34:45 --> 00:34:50
really is that way.
So, oh, it didn't quite work.

406
00:34:50 --> 00:34:55
But OK.  So here is a zygote and
here is this protein I've told you

407
00:34:55 --> 00:35:00
about, beta-catenin.
Now, in the zygote beta-catenin is

408
00:35:00 --> 00:35:06
phosphorylated.
And that renders it unstable for

409
00:35:06 --> 00:35:11
various reasons.
And it's also cytoplasmic.

410
00:35:11 --> 00:35:17
OK? With the action of the
determinants I've been telling you

411
00:35:17 --> 00:35:22
about, by about the two to four cell
stage, so very soon after

412
00:35:22 --> 00:35:28
fertilization the beta-catenin on
one side of the embryo,

413
00:35:28 --> 00:35:34
the side where these determinants
are has been dephosphorylated.

414
00:35:34 --> 00:35:38
So there is a post-translational
modification.  Dephosphorylated.

415
00:35:38 --> 00:35:43
And that renders it stable for
various reasons.

416
00:35:43 --> 00:35:47
It's no longer subject to protein
degradation.  It also allows it to

417
00:35:47 --> 00:35:52
enter the nucleus.
It allows it to act as a

418
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
transcription factor.
So these determinants are changing

419
00:35:57 --> 00:36:01
the stability and the protein
structure of this beta-catenin

420
00:36:01 --> 00:36:06
transcription factor.
Beta-catenin is really an important

421
00:36:06 --> 00:36:10
protein.  This is a wild type frog
embryo.  Two wild type frog embryos.

422
00:36:10 --> 00:36:14
The head, tail, here's the eye
forming.  In embryos that have been

423
00:36:14 --> 00:36:19
depleted of beta-catenin you get
these kinds of blobs that have no

424
00:36:19 --> 00:36:23
dorsal structures at all.
They've got no muscle.  They've got

425
00:36:23 --> 00:36:27
no nervous system.
Nothing that would normally come

426
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
from the dorsal side of the embryo.
So what is the identity of these

427
00:36:32 --> 00:36:37
dorsal determinants?
And, again, this you have partly on

428
00:36:37 --> 00:36:42
your handouts.
And the identity of the dorsal

429
00:36:42 --> 00:36:47
determinants ergo is something that
stabilizes beta-catenin and

430
00:36:47 --> 00:36:52
dephosphorylates it.
And what these are believed to be

431
00:36:52 --> 00:36:57
presently are two proteins called
GBP and dsh.  OK?

432
00:36:57 --> 00:37:02
You don't need to know the names.
It's the principle that's important

433
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
here.  But what's very interesting
is that GBP and dsh proteins bind to

434
00:37:08 --> 00:37:13
another protein called kinesin,
and kinesin attaches or is part of

435
00:37:13 --> 00:37:18
the microtubule system.
So you get these determinants

436
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24
attaching to the microtubules,
and as these microtubules polymerize

437
00:37:24 --> 00:37:29
and have a rotation associated with
them, it's not quite clear they

438
00:37:29 --> 00:37:35
rotate at this point,
this GBP and dsh are associated with

439
00:37:35 --> 00:37:40
the microtubules.
And then these two proteins,

440
00:37:40 --> 00:37:44
GBP and dsh, also called disheveled,
inhibit another protein called GSK3

441
00:37:44 --> 00:37:48
which is a kinase that
phosphorylates beta-catenin and

442
00:37:48 --> 00:37:52
renders it unstable.
So you're getting here dorsal

443
00:37:52 --> 00:37:56
determination.
You can go think about this more

444
00:37:56 --> 00:38:00
clearly.  Dorsal determination
because you are inhibiting

445
00:38:00 --> 00:38:05
an inhibitor.
All right?  Complicated?

446
00:38:05 --> 00:38:09
Yes.  Beautifully understood?
More or less.  This is really the

447
00:38:09 --> 00:38:14
most beautiful example that we know
of how you get determination of a

448
00:38:14 --> 00:38:18
particular region of the embryo.
OK.  So one step.  We probably have

449
00:38:18 --> 00:38:23
about 20 steps to go.
And clearly we're not going to

450
00:38:23 --> 00:38:27
cover them all so I'm giving you a
little meander through the number of

451
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
steps that are involved.
So another step informing muscle,

452
00:38:33 --> 00:38:39
that I want to tell you about, is
forming a particular kind of cell

453
00:38:39 --> 00:38:46
from which the muscle will arise.
So not only does muscle arise from

454
00:38:46 --> 00:38:52
cells that are dorsally located.
Muscle also arises from a cell type

455
00:38:52 --> 00:39:01
called the mesoderm.

456
00:39:01 --> 00:39:06
The mesoderm is part of a system of
cells that are the earliest known

457
00:39:06 --> 00:39:12
cell types in the embryo.
And these are the germ layers.

458
00:39:12 --> 00:39:18
And the germ layers consist of
mesoderm, and also of two other

459
00:39:18 --> 00:39:24
cells types called ectoderm and
endoderm.  OK.

460
00:39:24 --> 00:39:30
And these cell types were
discovered a lot time ago.

461
00:39:30 --> 00:39:33
They're not differentiated cell
types but they do have different

462
00:39:33 --> 00:39:37
properties.  They are stepwise along
the way to becoming different things.

463
00:39:37 --> 00:39:41
The mesoderm,
shown in red here,

464
00:39:41 --> 00:39:44
gives rise to the muscle,
blood, kidney, heart and various

465
00:39:44 --> 00:39:48
other things.  OK?
The ectoderm, for example,

466
00:39:48 --> 00:39:52
gives rise to all of the nervous
system, and the endoderm to the gut

467
00:39:52 --> 00:39:56
and the lung.  And they get their
names from their position

468
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
in the early embryo.
The endoderm is on the inside,

469
00:40:00 --> 00:40:06
the ectoderm on the outside, and the
mesoderm between the two.

470
00:40:06 --> 00:40:11
OK.  How does the mesoderm form?
The mesoderm forms through another

471
00:40:11 --> 00:40:16
complicated system.
It forms through the action of a

472
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
transcription factor called VegT.
And this is a maternally expressed

473
00:40:22 --> 00:40:27
transcription factor.
So we can distinguish maternal and

474
00:40:27 --> 00:40:33
zygotic effects, genetically
and in development.

475
00:40:33 --> 00:40:41
VegT is maternally expressed.
That means it is present in the egg.

476
00:40:41 --> 00:40:50
VegT in term activates in just one
region of the embryo another gene

477
00:40:50 --> 00:40:59
called nodal.  It's actually a set
of genes.  Nodal is

478
00:40:59 --> 00:41:08
a secreted factor.
It is actually a ligand and,

479
00:41:08 --> 00:41:16
therefore, an inducer.  And it is
zygotically expressed.

480
00:41:16 --> 00:41:24
So another principle, "zygotically
X" for expressed,

481
00:41:24 --> 00:41:33
and "maternally X" for expressed.
OK.

482
00:41:33 --> 00:41:37
This is one your handouts.
So we're talking now about the same

483
00:41:37 --> 00:41:42
time of development that we've been
talking about but a different system

484
00:41:42 --> 00:41:47
that is working in parallel.
Here is an embryo.  And I've shown

485
00:41:47 --> 00:41:51
you between the 200 and the 500 cell
stage that has got this VegT

486
00:41:51 --> 00:41:56
transcription factor present in the
nucleus.  It's a transcription

487
00:41:56 --> 00:42:01
factor.
And you can find a concentration

488
00:42:01 --> 00:42:05
gradient of this thing.
In one part of the embryo at this

489
00:42:05 --> 00:42:09
equatorial region there are low
amounts of it.

490
00:42:09 --> 00:42:14
Towards the vegetal pole there are
high amounts.  And where you have

491
00:42:14 --> 00:42:18
this low amount of VegT you get a
band of cells that's going to become

492
00:42:18 --> 00:42:23
mesoderm.  This mesoderm then goes
on to express this nodal gene which

493
00:42:23 --> 00:42:27
is a secreted ligand.
And, for those of you who are

494
00:42:27 --> 00:42:31
familiar with this,
it's a member of something called

495
00:42:31 --> 00:42:37
the TGF-beta family.
So this gives you another set of

496
00:42:37 --> 00:42:43
cells to deal with.
And what I'm going to tell you now

497
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
is that to think about where the
skeletal muscle comes from we have

498
00:42:49 --> 00:42:56
to superimpose the two things I've
told you about becoming dorsal and

499
00:42:56 --> 00:43:02
becoming mesodermal.
So the next thing we need to do is

500
00:43:02 --> 00:43:09
to talk about the dorsal mesoderm.
And we can write an equation here

501
00:43:09 --> 00:43:16
where beta-catenin plus nodal makes
dorsal mesoderm.

502
00:43:16 --> 00:43:23
And I'll tell you that this dorsal
mesoderm has a very special property

503
00:43:23 --> 00:43:31
and a special name.  It's
called the organizer.

504
00:43:31 --> 00:43:36
Is the dorsal mesoderm the future
skeletal muscle?

505
00:43:36 --> 00:43:42
I'm sorry to tell you it's not
really.  There's another step

506
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
involved.  And I will tell you in a
moment that the organizer is going

507
00:43:48 --> 00:43:54
to induce the precursors of the
skeletal muscle.

508
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
So let me write this down just to
give you a sense of where we are.

509
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
OK.  So let's move on here.
And let's define dorsal mesoderm by

510
00:44:04 --> 00:44:09
an equation.  And,
in fact, you can define this whole

511
00:44:09 --> 00:44:13
process by an equation.
But, of course, the genes that have

512
00:44:13 --> 00:44:18
to be expressed and so on have to be
expressed in a specific temporal

513
00:44:18 --> 00:44:23
order.  So it's not a simple linear
equation.  It's got a time component,

514
00:44:23 --> 00:44:28
too.  OK.  So here we have
beta-catenin on the dorsal side.

515
00:44:28 --> 00:44:33
And we have mesoderm defined by
nodal signaling in a band across the

516
00:44:33 --> 00:44:38
equator.  And if we superimpose them
we get a region where both of these

517
00:44:38 --> 00:44:43
factors are in the same group of
cells.  And where both of these

518
00:44:43 --> 00:44:49
factors are in the same group of
cells we get a special type of

519
00:44:49 --> 00:44:54
mesoderm formed called the dorsal
mesoderm or the organizer.

520
00:44:54 --> 00:45:00
The organizer is a very famous
piece of mesoderm.

521
00:45:00 --> 00:45:05
And it is famous for this reason.
This is a very old experiment that

522
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
was done in the 1920s where one
could take a piece of donor tissue

523
00:45:10 --> 00:45:16
from a donor embryo,
that is the future organizer,

524
00:45:16 --> 00:45:21
and move it to a host embryo, and
put it on the side of the embryo

525
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
where the organizer wasn't.
OK?  So to put it on the ventral

526
00:45:27 --> 00:45:31
side of the host embryo.
And when this was done,

527
00:45:31 --> 00:45:35
to the surprise of the investigators,
because they really didn't do the

528
00:45:35 --> 00:45:39
experiment for this reason,
they found that they got these

529
00:45:39 --> 00:45:43
conjoined twins.
Conjoined twin embryos.

530
00:45:43 --> 00:45:46
Here's your host embryo.
And this is a second embryo that's

531
00:45:46 --> 00:45:50
formed.  And you could look at see
where that piece of transplanted

532
00:45:50 --> 00:45:54
tissue went.  And when you did you
found it was in a strip along the

533
00:45:54 --> 00:45:58
back of the embryo,
but most of the second embryo,

534
00:45:58 --> 00:46:02
the conjoined embryo came from
tissue that was the host

535
00:46:02 --> 00:46:06
embryo tissue.
In other words,

536
00:46:06 --> 00:46:10
this piece of transplanted tissue
had organized or induced a second

537
00:46:10 --> 00:46:15
embryo, including all the skeletal
muscle.  OK?  And including a head

538
00:46:15 --> 00:46:19
and a brain and so on.
This is a very famous experiment,

539
00:46:19 --> 00:46:24
very famous piece of tissue.  And
for this experiment the Nobel Prize

540
00:46:24 --> 00:46:29
was awarded to Hans
Spemann in 1935.

541
00:46:29 --> 00:46:33
Here are conjoined frog embryos made
by transplanting organizers.

542
00:46:33 --> 00:46:38
You can see they have two heads and
they're joined at their tail region.

543
00:46:38 --> 00:46:43
What about humans?  Well, the same
thing is true in human embryos.

544
00:46:43 --> 00:46:48
Usually identical twin embryos will
split somewhere between the two cell

545
00:46:48 --> 00:46:52
stage and a very early stage where
there is something called the inner

546
00:46:52 --> 00:46:57
cell mass.  And you get two
identical embryos made and you get

547
00:46:57 --> 00:47:02
completely separate embryos made.
Sometimes, very rarely,

548
00:47:02 --> 00:47:06
you get incomplete splitting of the
embryo.  And the organizer is split

549
00:47:06 --> 00:47:10
in two in a human embryo,
and you land up with human conjoined

550
00:47:10 --> 00:47:14
twins.  This is very rare.
The survival of conjoined twins is

551
00:47:14 --> 00:47:19
very rare.  There are some instances,
and I've put on your handout a

552
00:47:19 --> 00:47:23
diagram of, these are actual girls
who had been diagramed that were

553
00:47:23 --> 00:47:27
just like the frogs,
with shared heads, with a shared

554
00:47:27 --> 00:47:32
trunk and separate heads.
So the processes in frogs,

555
00:47:32 --> 00:47:37
as far as we know, are very similar
to those in humans.

556
00:47:37 --> 00:47:42
Now, what I'm going to do because I
have very interesting stuff I'd like

557
00:47:42 --> 00:47:47
to finish this off,
finish off here, but I see time is

558
00:47:47 --> 00:47:52
creeping on, is to end off with a
teaser.  And to tell you that the

559
00:47:52 --> 00:47:57
final step in getting MyoD on is to
activate these things

560
00:47:57 --> 00:48:02
called somites.
And I'm going to take five minutes

561
00:48:02 --> 00:48:06
at the beginning of next lecture to
complete this and then we will move

562
00:48:06 --> 00:48:09
onto our next topic.  So thank you.
