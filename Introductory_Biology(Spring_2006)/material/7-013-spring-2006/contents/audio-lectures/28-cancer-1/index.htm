<p></p>
<p> </p> <p>So up until this point in the class you've learned basics about cell  molecular biology, genetics and development, how things normally work,  how cells normally function, how tissues are formed, how organisms are  formed and function.</p> <p>And hopefully you've had an ample founding in understanding normal biology.</p> <p>We're going to take a turn today and for the next three lectures talk  about abnormalities that lead to disease. And, whereas, I have tried to  keep things light for you in my lectures and try to be entertaining if  possible, the subject of the next three lectures is not a light one.</p> <p>It's a very serious one.</p> <p>And it is cancer. It is a disease that I know a great deal about and  have worked on in my lab for the last 17 years. It's a very important  and very devastating disease. And we're going to try to give you an  introduction to it.</p> <p>And you'll see that many of the things that you've learned over the  course of this class, up until this point, really prepare you to  understand the details of cancer, cancer development, and hopefully also  cancer treatment.</p> <p>And I'll say right up front that I'm actually quite optimistic that  the progress that we've made over the last several years in  understanding the molecular basis of cancer has put us into position to  treat the disease differently than we've done in the past and more  effectively.</p> <p>The number of drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of cancer today that are directed and  in this more effective class is not great, but there are some.</p> <p>And that number will increase. So I think there's reason for optimism  utilizing the information, the kinds of information, the strategies  that we'll cover in the next three lectures. So cancer, I think in some  respects, needs no introduction.</p> <p>It's a disease that probably has affected some of you already in your lives personally.</p> <p>Certainly everybody knows a family member or friend who has developed  the disease. It is a remarkably common disease. In this country alone  --</p> <p>-- more than a million people are diagnosed every year with cancer.</p> <p>And this does not include another million who are diagnosed with the  less serious forms of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous  cell carcinoma.</p> <p>So, in that respect, more than two million people get the diagnosis of cancer every year in this country. Moreover, each year --</p> <p>-- more than half a million people die in this country from cancer.</p> <p>That's more than 1,500 people per day. So in two days more people die  of cancer than died in the World Trade Center disaster. It's a  devastating disease.</p> <p>Half of the men in this room and a third of the females --</p> <p>-- will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes.</p> <p>And overall more than a quarter of all deaths are attributable to cancer.</p> <p>A major problem. A major burden. Clearly something we need to do  something about. So I'm going to show you some slides that introduce you  to the disease.</p> <p>Cancer, as you know, is a generic term that covers a class of  diseases that affect many, actually, almost all of your organs. You can  get cancers in different places.</p> <p>They're all defined by one common property which is too many cells.</p> <p>Too many cells in a tissue causing a lump. Too many cells in the  blood. Too many cells in lymph organs. So that's the common theme that  relates to all cancers, but there are very important differences in  cancers in different sites.</p> <p>This is a radiographic image of lung cancer.</p> <p>What you're looking at here is a standard chest x-ray. And this  individual, you can see, has an opacity right here, a fairly large  opacity that's probably about the size of your fist in this lobe of the  lung.</p> <p>And that's fairly advanced lung cancer. This is a more precise  diagnostic test called computed tomography, which is essentially a  series of x-ray slices that get reconstructed. It gives better  resolution.</p> <p>And you can see, again, a very large mass in the lung of this individual.</p> <p>So that's a solid tumor imaged by radiography. This is leukemia. Leukemia is also too many cells but here it's in the blood.</p> <p>This is a normal blood smear. These pale cells without nuclei are  your red blood cells. These nucleated cells are white blood cells of  different types. And you can see in this abnormal blood smear of a  leukemia patient there is a vast increase in the number of white blood  cells.</p> <p>So this is a diagnostic feature of leukemia, too many cells.</p> <p>And it's diagnosed by looking at blood counts. And the blood counts  in leukemia patients of white cell counts can be elevated by thousands,  if not hundreds of thousands of fold.</p> <p>You can also use other imaging techniques to detect and diagnose cancer. This is endoscopic examination, colonoscopy.</p> <p>It's now recommended that everyone undergoes this exam every year  when they reach age 50 to detect tumors at an early stage so that they  can be removed surgically which is, in fact, the most effective  treatment for colon cancer.</p> <p>And, actually, for almost all cancers. The most effective treatment  for cancer is the removal of the tumor. If you can get to the tumor at  an early stage through some of these imaging techniques and eradicate  it, remove it, you can greatly limit the mortality associated with the  disease.</p> <p>So this is endoscopy.</p> <p>This is what a normal colon looks like, sort of a smooth structure.  This is an early stage colon tumor. It's called a polyp at this stage.  And I'll give you a little bit more nomenclature in a minute.</p> <p>This is actually not cancer. A polyp is not cancer. It's a benign  tumor. This may or may not progress to a cancer, but if the doctor were  to find a polyp like that they might follow it for one or two years.</p> <p>But if were to get bigger they would remove it. And they can actually do it endoscopically.</p> <p>They can remove it using a surgical endoscope. They don't actually have to do surgery to remove polyps anymore.</p> <p>At some frequency these polyps do progress to colon cancer. And this  is a true cancer, a carcinoma which has changed its shape and  importantly changed its relationship to the tissue. Whereas, the polyp  is sort of sitting up on top of the tissue, having grown out of the  tissue, the colon cancer has invaded into the tissue.</p> <p>It has become much more destructive in that sense.</p> <p>And also, importantly, has the capacity to move outside of the colon  through that process of invasion to other parts of the body, and thereby  cause problems elsewhere.</p> <p>Usually, when these are diagnosed by endoscopy or other methods, they  are removed. This is done by surgery where a portion of the colon is  actually removed and then the two resected ends joined.</p> <p>And you can see the colon cancer right here.</p> <p>If the cancer is detected at an early enough stage, surgery is  curative for colon cancer. Unfortunately, it's often too late when it's  diagnosed. It looks like that. Because it's already moved outside of the  colon and tumor cells have found their way to other parts of the body.</p> <p>So surgical removal of the primary tumor, while helpful, may actually  not be curative. So I want to go through in diagrammatic form some of  the points that I've just made.</p> <p>Cancer develops in states.</p> <p>It doesn't happen all at once. As I showed you in the normal colon  polyp to colon cancer series, things happen in stages. It's actually  best worked out in the colon. But we believe the same phenomena hold  true for other cancers in other places.</p> <p>It doesn't happen all at once. It happens in stages. And these slides  illustrate the basic principles of that. This illustrates a normal  tissue. It could be anywhere, but let's say that it's in the colon.</p> <p>And there are certain important features to pay attention to.</p> <p>One is that the cells have regular shape and a regular relationship  to their neighbors. As you know, tissues are formed for normal function.  They have particular genes expressed. They have particular structures  inside them.</p> <p>They interact with their neighbors in order to perform their  function. So the cells of the colonic epithelium line up like this  touching each other, interacting with each other and interacting with  the cells underneath them, as well as other material underneath them.</p> <p>Here is a material called the basement membrane, otherwise known as the extracellular matrix.</p> <p>And this helps support the cells and provides the cells with certain  nutrients and growth factors. There are also cells below these cells in  the colon and in other tissues which replenish these cells when they get  lost.</p> <p>These stem or progenitor cells exist probably in all adult tissues. They get recruited when cells turnover.</p> <p>And we now think, and it's not illustrated on these slides, but we  now think that these cells are probably very important in tumor  initiation.</p> <p>We think that these are cells, these stem cells of the tissue are  likely to be the place where the tumors initiate and then produce cells,  like this brown cell here, which is already abnormal. Cells that have  acquired a mutation which makes them different from their neighbors.</p> <p>Now, the first consequence of those early changes is that you get too many cells. And this is a process known as hyperplasia.</p> <p>Hyperplasia simply means hyper, too many, plasia, division, cell division.</p> <p>So there are too many cells. But the cells that are present there  look pretty normal. They don't histologically, by looking at the tissue,  appear different from their normal neighbors. There are just too many  of them.</p> <p>This process continues until you can actually see a discernable lump, a mass, and that is a formation of a benign tumor.</p> <p>In the colon that tumor, that benign tumor is called an adenoma. It's  called other things in other places but let's say, just for the sake of  simplicity, it's a benign tumor.</p> <p>And, again, this is an increase in the number of cells but the cells  themselves don't look very different from their normal neighbors. And  these tumors are not life-threatening yet. They sometimes will never be  life-threatening but in this form they rarely cause problems.</p> <p>They're just a lump. Like a wart is a benign tumor, a lump that doesn't cause problems.</p> <p>At some frequency these tumors can progress further. And now, as you  can see from this different shading, the cells take on different  characteristics.</p> <p>They look different from their normal neighbors. Their cyto  architecture, the cell shape looks different. The nucleus often looks  different from the normal cells. And so they've become fundamentally  changed in their appearance.</p> <p>Moreover, they have begun to recruit a blood supply. The presence of  these blood vessels which were not present up here is another indication  that things have progressed.</p> <p>And tumors require a blood supply of their own to feed the tissue, this abnormal growing tissue.</p> <p>As soon as they get to a certain size they need to recruit a new  blood supply. This tumor at this stage has changed enough that we now  call it cancer. This is based on these histological changes, the  appearance of the cells, as well as the cells' relationship to one  another.</p> <p>And this is now considered dangerous. If you're diagnosed with a  cancer, even if it's present in the tissue, the initial tissue alone, it  would be recommended for removal. However, it rarely stays there.</p> <p>Tumors have the capacity to move from their original site through a  process of invasion and then metastasis. This illustrates invasion,  local invasion where the tumor cells are moving from the mass through  the basement membrane and ultimately accessing the blood supply.</p> <p>Literally moving into blood vessels, traveling through the blood, and  then moving out of blood vessels and beginning to proliferate, expand  in other tissues.</p> <p>And this is the process of metastasis. And the tumor cells can  literally go anywhere. Certain tumors have preferences to go to certain  tissues than others. And when they get there they begin to grow again  and turn, become actually more advanced, more dangerous, cause local  tissue damage, organ failure.</p> <p>And it's usually this that causes the death of the cancer patient.</p> <p>It's the metastatic spread of the disease as opposed to the primary  tumor that tends to kill cancer patients. And sadly it's this phase of  the disease, metastatic spread that we know the littlest about.</p> <p>We actually know rather little about what allows cells to move from  their primary site through the blood, establish themselves elsewhere and  then grow there.</p> <p>And since it is the most deadly phase of the disease, it represents a clear need, clear opportunity to learn more.</p> <p>So let me just illustrate, or rather emphasize some of these bits of terminology for you.</p> <p>Hyperplasia is simply too many cells. You have hyperplastic lesions, we call them, throughout your body.</p> <p>Most of them no problem at all. They're not going to do anything.  It's just there are too few many cells in that particular place. These  can progress to benign tumors which are non-aggressive.</p> <p>That is the cells are relatively well-behaved.</p> <p>They're not dividing that much. They're not moving around. They have  normal relationships with their neighbors. And with respect to the  tissue that they reside in, they're nondestructive. They haven't  breached the underlying basement membrane.</p> <p>They haven't changed their relationship with their normal neighbors.  And they're also defined through a lack of spread. They haven't moved  out into the local lymph nodes or to surrounding tissues.</p> <p>These can progress to malignant tumors.</p> <p>And these are true cancers. We actually only use the term cancer to  refer to malignant tumors, not to benign tumors. These are true cancers.  And these are aggressive. The cells have changed shape.</p> <p>They have much greater proliferative capacity. They move around to a greater degree.</p> <p>They are destructive with respect to the tissue in which they reside. And they have the potential to spread.</p> <p>Not all diagnosed cancers have already spread, but the view of the  pathologist is that they have the potential to spread and therefore they  are typically removed. Now cancers in different places have different  names.</p> <p>As I said, you can get cancer in virtually all tissues of your body.</p> <p>There are probably 250 or 300 different types of cancer clinically  defined, and those are defined in part based on where they are and in  what types of cells they occur.</p> <p>So there are tumors of epithelial cells, cells of the skin, lining of  the intestine, mammary epithelial cells, epithelial cells of your  brain.</p> <p>And these tumors are called carcinomas. These cancers are called carcinomas.</p> <p>And you might have heard, for example, a subset of carcinomas called  adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinoma is what I showed you with respect to the  colon cancers. Adenocarcinoma of the breast. Adenocarcinoma of the  lung.</p> <p>These are carcinomas that have a glandular appearance. And there are other kinds of carcinomas as well.</p> <p>Those are the cancers. And the benign tumors of these tissues,  especially of the class that gives rise to adenocarcinomas are called  adenomas.</p> <p>There are also tumors of your connective tissues like you cartilage or your muscles or your tendons.</p> <p>These are called sarcomas. And you've probably heard of myosarcomas. Those are tumors of the muscle.</p> <p>And there are different types of myosarcomas. And then there are tumors of the blood system.</p> <p>These are called leukemias if the tumors are present, tumor cells are present within the blood itself.</p> <p>And I showed you an example of that. Or lymphomas. And here it's  defined as tumors which stay within lymph organs like lymph nodes or  spleen or thymus. They haven't made their way out into the blood, but  they are still tumors of the blood cells.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>So we know a lot about what these tumors look like based on visual  inspection. We also know what they look like based on histological  analysis. This is a progression series actually taken from a mouse model  of cancer generated in my lab.</p> <p>It's a tumor of the lung. You might be able to see the lacey  appearance of the lung here. And this circle you can see hyperplasia,  too many cells.</p> <p>Cells, if you were to see them up close, look pretty much like their neighbors, but there are just too many of them.</p> <p>These progress into lumps, masses called adenomas in this case. These  are benign tumors. They don't have the features of the more aggressive  malignant cells. And you can see them here. They all look pretty much  the same.</p> <p>And if you saw them next to a normal cell they would look pretty much like those.</p> <p>But these can progress into adenocarcinomas, more advanced tumors.  These are true cancers. And you can tell that based on the fact that the  nuclei, if you compare one cell to another, looks very different, and  the cell shape looks very different from one to the other.</p> <p>So there's heterogeneity. And what you cannot see here is that the  tumors are also much more proliferative. They are dividing. The cells  are dividing much more frequently. So, again, histologically we can  characterize what these tumors look like.</p> <p>What I'm going to tell you about from this point really to the end of  the class is that we understand, at least to a degree, what these  arrows represent, what happens to a normal cell on the way to  hyperplasia or to an adenoma or to an adenocarcinoma.</p> <p>And the answer is defects to genes. Defects to many genes underlie  these transitions, allow a normal cell to develop into a cancer cell.</p> <p>And so in that sense we consider cancer as a genetic disease.</p> <p>Now, cancer actually is also a more traditional genetic disease in  some instances. There are people who are genetically predisposed to  developing cancer. And I'm actually going to tell you about them next  time.</p> <p>But even for people who are not genetically predisposed to cancer,  the development of cancer in them is a genetic disease. How do we know  that? Why do we think that? Well, we think that for a number of reasons.</p> <p>And one of them, which we've appreciated for more than a hundred  years is that the chromosomes of cancer cells are screwed up. They look  different than normal cells. I've actually shown you this slide before.</p> <p>This is a karyotype of a normal cell, 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs. These  are highlighted by stains that allow us to distinguish one chromosome  from another. So chromosome one stains yellow, chromosome two stains  red, and so on and so forth.</p> <p>And this is the karyotype of a cancer cell. It's different in many ways. Name me two.</p> <p>I didn't hear anybody. I heard there was mumbling but I didn't hear anybody. Say again.</p> <p>The number and shape of chromosomes.</p> <p>Good. So clearly there are too many chromosomes. I didn't count them  up, but there is more than double the proper number of chromosomes in  this cancer cell. So chromosome number defects are quite common in  cancer cells.</p> <p>But also structure, and I've boxed two of them here, the structure of  chromosomes in cancer cells are different. This chromosome has  undergone what we call a translocation in which a piece of one  chromosome has been joined to a piece of a different chromosome.</p> <p>And we now know that when that happens it's reflective of a mutation  that either is inactivating or activating a gene that's present at the  point of translocation.</p> <p>And this chromosome has undergone a truncation, a deletion. Genetic  material has been loss. And this, again, indicates that there was a gene  present there that the tumor cell wanted to get rid of in the  development of the cancer.</p> <p>So chromosomal abnormalities are quite common, which was a first clue that cancer is a genetic disease.</p> <p>The second indication, which came along as early as the 1920s, is  that many carcinogens, and what I mean by that is agents that cause  cancer.</p> <p>Many carcinogens are mutagens, agents that cause what? Yeah?</p> <p>Not all.</p> <p>But there is a very high correlation between things that will cause  cancer and things that will cause mutation in simple mutation assays.</p> <p>And you can do assays to determine the carcinogenicity or mutagenicity of an agent of interest.</p> <p>Carcinogenicity assays are done typically in experimental animals, mice or rats.</p> <p>And one takes the animal and exposes it to agent X. It might be  injected into the animal or it might be painted on the skin of the  animal. And then one waits a period of time and asks the question did  the animal develop a tumor?</p> <p>And if so the agent is a carcinogen.</p> <p>And you can actually determine how strong a carcinogen is, how strong  a carcinogen it is by determine the dose, the amount of the agent  needed to produce a tumor. There are also mutagenicity tests.</p> <p>And this is typically done in bacteria.</p> <p>So one takes a bacterial strain and asks whether the agent can cause  mutations in that strain. And usually to do this one takes a bacterial  strain that already has a mutation, a bacteria that is histidine  deficient, which means that it's not able to synthesize its own  histidine and amino acid.</p> <p>That means that if you take that bacteria strain and plate it onto a  Petri dish that lacks histidine, you haven't added histidine to the  media, will it grow? No.</p> <p>It's histidine minus, it cannot make its own, if you don't provide it, cells cannot grow, so you get no colonies.</p> <p>However, if I now add agent X, which I think might be a mutagen, to  these bacteria, if it is a mutagen it might mutate the defective  histidine gene and turn it into a normally functioning histidine gene  such that if I now plate these bacteria that have been treated with the  mutagen I may get some colonies.</p> <p>And you're still using a his-minus plate here.</p> <p>And the number of colonies that I get is an indication of the  strength of the mutagen. Lots of colonies, strong mutagen. Fewer, not so  strong. And what I'm saying is that there's a strong correlation  between things that pass this assay and things that pass that assay,  another indication that cancer might be caused by mutations to DNA.</p> <p>Now some things that we know for sure are carcinogens. They pass this carcinogenicity test very, very strongly.</p> <p>Fail in this simple mutagenicity test. Why? How can that be? They clearly are cancer-causing.</p> <p>But if you mix them with bacteria in isolation here you don't get any  increased mutation frequency. What's different? What's different about  this situation versus this situation? Yes?</p> <p>Excellent.</p> <p>Precisely correct. There are certain agents which in their native  form are not mutagenic. We call them promutagens. However, when acted on  by the body in the process of metabolism they become mutagens.</p> <p>The body senses that these are actually dangerous compounds and will  try to detoxify them, typically by adding hydroxyl groups to them to  make them more water-soluble so that they can be secreted or excreted by  the body.</p> <p>But in the process of making them more water-soluble they go through  an intermediate form which turns out to be highly mutagenic.</p> <p>And that's illustrated here for a very powerful carcinogen known as benzo(a)pyrene.</p> <p>This is an agent found in cigarette smoke, for example. This agent is  not highly mutagenic on its own, but in this type of test it is highly  carcinogenic. And what happens is that the body, in an attempt to add  hydroxyl groups to make it more water-soluble, will actually introduce  epoxides in different ring positions of this molecule, as an  intermediate towards making it more hydroxylated.</p> <p>And these epoxides are very interactive with DNA and therefore mutagenic.</p> <p>So the body turns something that actually wasn't mutagenic into  something that is mutagenic. And therefore this test, this mutagenicity  test has been modified, principally based on the work of a  bacteriologist at Berkeley named Bruce Ames.</p> <p>And so we now call it the Ames Test.</p> <p>And the Ames Test takes the compound, the agent that you're trying to  test the mutagenicity of, and rather than adding it directly back to  bacteria it's mixed first with an extract of the liver. Many of the  enzymes that do this detoxification are present in your liver.</p> <p>Cytochrome P450 enzymes, for example.</p> <p>In which case the compound becomes modified, or might become  modified. And through that modification becomes mutagenic. And then the  agent gets tested in the standard bacterial mutagenicity test.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>So we can now expand our list of things that are mutagenic through exposing them to some of the body's own enzymes.</p> <p>In this sense, the body is actually doing you a disservice in thinking it's actually trying to help you.</p> <p>There are still other agents which are not mutagens, even in the Ames  Test, but are clearly carcinogens. Asbestos, for example. That stuff in  packing material that's now been banned exposure to which gives people,  or can give people mesotheliomia, a tumor of the lining of the lungs.</p> <p>It's not a mutagen. However, you test it, it's not a mutagen.  Alcohol, which is clearly associated with liver cancer, is not a  mutagen. These agents we think act as irritants. They case damage to  tissue which causes the cells to have to increase their proliferation to  repair the tissue, and that is inherently a mutagenic process.</p> <p>And so these things can act as carcinogens in that very indirect way.</p> <p>OK. Now there are many things in our environment that are carcinogens --</p> <p>-- that we get exposed to either passively or deliberately.</p> <p>Sunlight, for example, is a carcinogen and a mutagen. It causes  damage to DNA, causes mutation, increases your risk of skin cancer.</p> <p>Other things that we do to ourselves. Certain dietary carcinogens we impose on ourselves.</p> <p>But what's the biggest carcinogen that we impose on ourselves? Smoke. Tobacco smoke.</p> <p>And obviously tobacco smoke is associated with one particular type of cancer, although it's not limited to lung cancer.</p> <p>Any idea how many people die of lung cancer in this country per year?  Anybody want to hazard a guess? 10,000? 100,000? 175,000. 175,000  people per year die of lung cancer each year. And more than 150,000 of  them it's because of smoking.</p> <p>Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer.</p> <p>It kills more people in this country than breast cancer, colon cancer  and prostate cancer combined. And it's completely preventable, or  almost completely preventable through a change of habit, failure to  smoke.</p> <p>So let me just emphasize the importance of this.</p> <p>These are curves that show the smoking frequency in this country  among men and women and the incidence of cancer, lung cancer in this  country among men and women.</p> <p>You can see that early on, in the early part of the century smoking  was uncommon and lung cancer was uncommon. But as people began to smoke  this frequency increased and then years later the incidence of lung  cancer increased dramatically.</p> <p>It takes a little while.</p> <p>You've got to expose yourself to these carcinogens for a period of  time for this process to have its effect, but eventually that smoking  exposure leads to the development of lung cancer.</p> <p>You can see that women started smoking a little bit later, but they  quickly caught up. And now the lung cancer incidence in women is also  extremely high. Lung cancer among women is the leading cause of cancer  deaths.</p> <p>It's now surpassed breast cancer as the leading cancer killer of women.</p> <p>The statistics about smoking in this country, despite these facts,  are remarkable. 47 million adults smoke. Roughly one in four men, and  almost as many women smoke.</p> <p>Even more amazing to me than that, in 2002, I don't have more recent  statistics than that, but in 2002 the percent of high school students  who responded to a survey about whether they smoked was what?</p> <p>What do you think? High school students.</p> <p>28%. So this is not just people who have been smoking a long time,  who started when they didn't know any better. Kids who get exposed to  the message about smoking and lung cancer from an early age are not  paying attention.</p> <p>So the problem is not going away. These folks obviously have a dramatically increased risk of dying from lung cancer.</p> <p>And it's not just lung cancer. Smoking increases your risk of heart disease, of stroke, of emphysema.</p> <p>I read a startling statistic when I was preparing this. Of all the  people who are alive today on this planet, 500 million of them will die  early due to tobacco usage.</p> <p>500 million people who are alive today would live longer if not for exposure to tobacco products.</p> <p>So if you learn nothing else from this class this year, if you now  smoke, stop. If you don't smoke, don't start. OK. So carcinogens in our  environment and carcinogens that we exposure ourselves to are important.</p> <p>No doubt about it, they can be a cause of cancer.</p> <p>I call these exogenous or environmental mutagens. And, as I  mentioned, sunlight and other forms of radiation, certain dietary things  that we expose ourselves to fall into this category.</p> <p>But they're not the only thing that causes cancer. And it's very  important that you know that. In fact, more of the mutations that happen  in cancer are due to indigenous processes, things that happen inside  your bodies regardless of what you get exposed to, like DNA replication  mistakes.</p> <p>DNA polymerases that duplicate your DNA are pretty good, they have proofreading functions, but they still make mistakes.</p> <p>And these mistakes can be then in critical genes which can ultimately lead to tumor development.</p> <p>Your DNA can sometimes get broken.</p> <p>It gets moved around inside the cell during various processes.  Sometimes it gets broken, and sometimes those breaks are not properly  repaired. And this can lead to some of the defects that I've shown you  on this slide like the translocations where different pieces get  rearranged with the wrong other piece.</p> <p>Defects in chromosome segregation.</p> <p>We talked about mitosis early in the class and how the cells have an  intricate ability to properly segregate their chromosomes, that each  daughter cell gets the right number. Sometimes that process doesn't work  properly so that one cell gets too many chromosomes or one cell gets  too few.</p> <p>These chromosomal imbalances can also contribute to tumor development.</p> <p>Defects in DNA repair.</p> <p>Your cells have all sorts of enzymes that will try to find damaged  DNA and fix it, but these enzymes themselves can be mutationally  inactivated in the development of cancer.</p> <p>So now you've debilitated the cell's ability to fix the damage  leading to an increased frequency of damage, increased frequency of  mutation, increased cancer risk.</p> <p>And importantly --</p> <p>-- production of indigenous mutagens in contrast to exogenous mutagens.</p> <p>Your body actually produces things that are mutagenic.</p> <p>And the biggest class of these are oxygen radicals such as superoxide --</p> <p>-- or hydrogen peroxide.</p> <p>And these radicals are highly reactive to DNA, can cause DNA breaks and base changes, and cause mutation.</p> <p>And your body produces these naturally in the process of metabolism.  You have enzymes that will kind of keep the concentrations of these down  but, nevertheless, they're present and cause damage at a certain  frequency in all cells.</p> <p>If that damage occurs in the wrong cell at the wrong time it can be  cancer-causing. So there are lots of ways that the DNA of your cells can  get mutated, which then overall contributes to the development of  cancer.</p> <p>Now, this doesn't happen all at once, as I've tried to indicate to you.</p> <p>It doesn't happen from normal cell to cancer cell in a single step.  We think that this process happens over time. And in humans over decades  of time. Cancers often initiate maybe in mid-life, but they don't  present themselves as a clinically advanced tumor until late in life.</p> <p>and that's because the process requires lots of steps that require lots of time to accumulate.</p> <p>And so we now consider tumor development from a normal cell to a more advanced cancer cell as a clonal evolution process.</p> <p>A clonal evolution process whereby abnormal cells arise in a  population. These now have a selected advantage compared to their normal  cells and will grow, for example, better than their normal cells,  divide faster than their normal cells, make more of themselves.</p> <p>The mutation that took place is now present in all the daughter cells of that abnormal cell.</p> <p>And within that now-expanded clone of abnormal cells a second  mutation takes place which increases the capacity of that cell to grow  and divide, survive, move around compared to its neighbors. So now this  cell and of its descendents have two mutations.</p> <p>And within that expanded clone a third mutation can take place and so and so forth.</p> <p>We now think that cancers, advanced cancers in human probably have  five, ten, maybe twenty distinct mutations in genes controlling  important processes.</p> <p>What are those processes? There are many. We're going to emphasis, in  this class, just proliferation and cell death. I'll say a bit more  about that in a second. But it's also important for you to know that the  cancer cells also regulate factors that increase the blood supply.</p> <p>Cancer cells turn on growth factors that recruit blood vessels.</p> <p>If they didn't do so they would never be able to progress. You cannot  actually make a solid tumor bigger than two millimeters in diameter  without recruiting a new blood supply. And so the tumor cells turn on  these factors to deal with angiogenesis.</p> <p>They also turn on factors that allow them to move around to a greater  degree or separate themselves from their neighbors to invade into the  basement tissues, the basement membranes.</p> <p>To turn on proteases, for example, that chew up the extracellular matrix to allow the cells to move around, and other factors.</p> <p>Factors, for example, that allow them to move into the blood vessels  or move back out of the blood vessels in the process of metastasis. So  we're going to emphasis proliferation and cell death in the next  lecture, but I want you to know that many other aspects of cell biology  are important in this process as well.</p> <p>So proliferation, it's kind of obvious that in cancers there might be changes that lead to more cell division.</p> <p>And, indeed, the original cancer-associated genes did this. And many  of the important cancer-associated genes that we know about are involved  in promoting increased cell division.</p> <p>But we also know that cell death or apoptosis, which I briefly  introduced you to in an earlier lecture, is important in tumor  development.</p> <p>And do you find more apoptosis or less apoptosis during tumor  development? Less. There's decreased amounts of cell death in tumor  cells compared to normal cells.</p> <p>And this is due to mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis,  positive mutations that block apoptosis, loss of function mutations in  genes that are normally required for apoptosis.</p> <p>And we think, therefore, that the balance, if you think of this as a  scale where proliferation is on one end and cell death is on the other.</p> <p>Whereas, this process is well balanced in normal tissues, what we  call normal homeostasis, you produce as many cells as you need, you kill  off as many cells as you need in order to give rise to a normal,  average cell number.</p> <p>In cancer this process is deranged. And this can happen in one of two ways, and typically in both.</p> <p>There can be an increase in proliferation and a reduction in cell  death. And we'll talk about some of the factors that control those  specifically next time.</p> <p>But the final way that we know that cancer is a genetic disease is by  looking in the DNA of a tumor, by looking at the genes themselves. You  know about genes. You know about gene sequences. You know how to figure  out what the sequence of a gene is.</p> <p>When this is done in a cancer cell compared to a normal cell one finds mutations.</p> <p>And this is actually the very first cancer gene found in the context  of human cancer. It was found here at MIT by Bob Weinberg's lab. And  when its DNA was sequenced compared to the normal sequence shown above  it incurred a mutation, a mutation which blocked the ability of this  protein to be properly regulated leading to increased proliferation.</p> <p>And I'll tell you that story next time.</p>
