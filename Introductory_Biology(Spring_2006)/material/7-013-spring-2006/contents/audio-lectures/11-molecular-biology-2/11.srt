1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
OK.  And here we are in the
molecular biology section.

2
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
And the goal of this section,
as Professor Jacks started to tell

3
00:00:27 --> 00:00:33
you during the Genetics module and
Professor Baker told you at the

4
00:00:33 --> 00:00:39
beginning of last lecture is try to
link together in molecular terms the

5
00:00:39 --> 00:00:45
question of genotype and the
question of phenotype.

6
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
And we presented to you this notion
that goes by the ponderous name of

7
00:00:51 --> 00:00:58
the central dogma that the link
between genotype and phenotype is

8
00:00:58 --> 00:01:04
related to DNA as a genetic material
that then proceeds to transmit its

9
00:01:04 --> 00:01:11
information to a final outcome,
which is very often a protein,

10
00:01:11 --> 00:01:17
through an RNA intermediate.
And the point of these molecular

11
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
biology lectures is to tell you
about the molecular biology,

12
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
and then at the end to try to bring
together this genotype and phenotype

13
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
in molecular terms.
Now, last lecture you talked about

14
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
DNA replication,
DNA as the genetic material required

15
00:01:36 --> 00:01:41
to be replicated faithfully and
accurately so it can transmit its

16
00:01:41 --> 00:01:46
information to the next generation.
Professor Baker I know stressed the

17
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
requirement for accurate replication,
but she did not do one part of this

18
00:01:50 --> 00:01:55
lecture that I want to spend a
couple of minutes now discussing

19
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
with you.  And that is the question
of DNA repair.

20
00:02:00 --> 00:02:13
So there are two types of DNA repair.

21
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
Actually, three types that I want
to talk to you about.

22
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
And the first pertains to the
accuracy of the DNA polymerase that

23
00:02:25 --> 00:02:32
replicates the DNA.  So
DNA polymerase --

24
00:02:32 --> 00:02:40
-- three, or the DNA polymerase that

25
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
replicates the DNA makes mistakes.
It puts in the wrong nucleotide.

26
00:02:45 --> 00:02:51
It puts in the wrong base.
And it does so about one in ten to

27
00:02:51 --> 00:02:56
the fifth bases.
OK?  So one in a hundred thousand

28
00:02:56 --> 00:03:01
bases is wrong.
Now, if you think about the fact

29
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
that there are more than ten to the
ninth bases in a human genome,

30
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
every cell cycle that translates to
ten thousand or so mistakes,

31
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
that's a lot of changes in the DNA.
That's not a very faithful kind of

32
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
DNA replication.
So this has been selected against

33
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
evolutionarily.
And there is a mechanism that's

34
00:03:22 --> 00:03:30
called proofreading --

35
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
That allows this high error rate to
be corrected.  And it's actually

36
00:03:35 --> 00:03:40
very cleaver.  So this DNA
polymerase has what is called an

37
00:03:40 --> 00:03:45
exonuclease activity.
Exo meaning out.  Nuclease meaning

38
00:03:45 --> 00:03:50
to break down nucleic acids.
And this exonuclease proceeds from

39
00:03:50 --> 00:03:55
the 3 prime to the 5 prime direction,
the 3 prime nucleotide being the one

40
00:03:55 --> 00:04:00
that was added last as
you should now know.

41
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
And so what DNA polymerase does as
it is replicating is it kind of

42
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
feels whether or not the double
helix has reformed in a smooth way.

43
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
And if it feels that there is a
bubble there, a bubble where the two

44
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
bases, actually look at me rather
than the diagram.

45
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
I think it's easier.
I can do it better with my hands.

46
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
Where you've got a nice smooth
helix, if there is a mismatched

47
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
nucleotide, the bases do not pair,
there will be a bubble.

48
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
OK?  There will be a bubble in the
helix or a space in the helix.

49
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
The two strands will not be joined
together.  And the DNA polymerase

50
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
can sense this and it can go back
and it excises the wrong nucleotide

51
00:04:43 --> 00:04:48
and puts in the correct one.
OK?  This is called proofreading.

52
00:04:48 --> 00:04:53
And it's extremely necessary and
it's actually very good.

53
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
And what it does is to decrease the
error rate to one in ten

54
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
to the ninth bases.
OK?  So you get four orders of

55
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
magnitude improvement in the
accuracy of DNA replication.

56
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
Now, there is another set of things
that can go wrong.

57
00:05:12 --> 00:05:18
And these actually fall under the
heading of mutagens.

58
00:05:18 --> 00:05:23
Mutagens, as Professor Jacks
mentioned to you,

59
00:05:23 --> 00:05:28
being agents which change the base
sequence of the DNA once

60
00:05:28 --> 00:05:33
the DNA is there.
And these can either be chemical or

61
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
these can be ionizing radiation.
And in those cases also the helix

62
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
gets changed because the wrong base
gets put in.  No,

63
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
not because the wrong base gets put
in.  But because there is a chemical

64
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
reaction which might modify a base,
which might, for example, covalently

65
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
link two bases.
thymine for example.

66
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
If two thymines are sitting next to
one another in the helix,

67
00:05:57 --> 00:06:02
ultraviolet light is very good at
cross linking those.

68
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
And you now have something called a
thymine dimer.

69
00:06:06 --> 00:06:10
And that is very bad because that
is not a normal base sequence.

70
00:06:10 --> 00:06:14
And when replication time comes
along that DNA helix is abnormal and

71
00:06:14 --> 00:06:19
the replication machinery doesn't
know what to do about it,

72
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
and that can lead to all sorts of
problems and to mutations.

73
00:06:23 --> 00:06:28
So there are mechanisms that can
get rid of abnormal bases.

74
00:06:28 --> 00:06:34
So mutagens can chemically,
actually, maybe not say chemically.

75
00:06:34 --> 00:06:41
Let me just say change bases.  They
change base structure either to

76
00:06:41 --> 00:06:48
something that looks like another
normal new base or to something that

77
00:06:48 --> 00:06:55
looks abnormal.
And there are two mechanisms to get

78
00:06:55 --> 00:07:02
rid of this.  One is called excision
repair and the other is called

79
00:07:02 --> 00:07:08
mismatch repair.
I have them written in the reverse

80
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
order than is on this diagram from
your book.  In mismatch repair there

81
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
is one nucleotide that looks normal,
but it's different.  It doesn't

82
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
match the, usually it looks normal.
It doesn't match the one opposite

83
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
to it.  And in that case the repair
machinery can go in and remove the

84
00:07:24 --> 00:07:28
abnormal or the mismatched
nucleotide, and there's another

85
00:07:28 --> 00:07:33
enzyme that will go and correct it.
In excision repair,

86
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
one very often, excision repair
occurs when, for example,

87
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
two nucleotides have become
covalently linked to one another,

88
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
and the one strand of the helix is
just a mess.  And there is an enzyme,

89
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
or enzyme complex that will go in
and actually excise a little chunk

90
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
of the helix.  And then another
enzyme will come in and fill in the

91
00:07:53 --> 00:07:58
gap so that you get the
helix repaired.

92
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
Now, the challenge in this,
and you may be asking yourselves

93
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
this, is how does this repair
machinery know which the correct

94
00:08:07 --> 00:08:12
strand was?  In the case of
proofreading it's very interesting

95
00:08:12 --> 00:08:17
because initially after replication
the newly synthesized DNA strand is

96
00:08:17 --> 00:08:22
not modified.  It's just a normal
nucleotide polymer.

97
00:08:22 --> 00:08:27
However, the template strand,
the template strands, the parental

98
00:08:27 --> 00:08:32
strands over time become
chemically modified.

99
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
The bases actually get,
especially adenine gets some methyl

100
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
groups added to it.
And this  is different than the

101
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
newly synthesized with doesn't have
these methyl groups.

102
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
And so the polymerase knows which
strand is the old strand and the

103
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
correct one and which is the new
strand and the incorrect one.

104
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
In the case of excision and
mismatch repair,

105
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
that's sometimes not clear.
Where you've got these thymine

106
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
dimmers, these Ts that are joined
together then that's clearly the

107
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
wrong, that's clearly wrong.
OK?  The enzymatic machinery can

108
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
take that out and copy the other
strand.  Sometimes,

109
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
though, if you just have a chemical
conversion of one base to another,

110
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
the repair machinery does not know
which strand is the correct and

111
00:09:18 --> 00:09:22
which isn't.  And that's when you'll
get mutations fixed in the DNA

112
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
because at replication you really
may get the changing,

113
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
you may get the incorrect,
you may not get the correct base

114
00:09:30 --> 00:09:36
repairs.
And then that incorrect base will be

115
00:09:36 --> 00:09:42
passed on through the next
generation.  OK.

116
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
So this is a very rapid zip through
DNA repair that I wanted you to be

117
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
able to think about.
I want to move onto the next step

118
00:09:54 --> 00:10:01
in the transmission of information
from gene to final product today.

119
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
And I want to talk to you about the
generation of RNA.

120
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
And so let us begin with a quiz.
And I have for you a new incentive

121
00:10:11 --> 00:10:17
to pay attention,
a new prize that you can use to

122
00:10:17 --> 00:10:22
think about the conversion of
potential to kinetic energy,

123
00:10:22 --> 00:10:27
and also you can use to amuse
yourself when you're downloading

124
00:10:27 --> 00:10:33
very poor, when you're downloading
things from the Internet and have

125
00:10:33 --> 00:10:38
nothing better to do.
I can usually get this right across

126
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
the room.  There you go.
You can also use it to think about

127
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
the nature of amphibians,
they're nice flying frogs.

128
00:10:46 --> 00:10:51
OK.  So let us pose the question
here, what is RNA?

129
00:10:51 --> 00:11:01
And you've had some of this on a

130
00:11:01 --> 00:11:06
problem set, but you really need to
know what I'm talking about.

131
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
This is a ribonucleotide.  How do I
know that this is a ribonucleotide?

132
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
Think about it.  You can put your
hands up, but I want everyone to

133
00:11:17 --> 00:11:22
think about it.
OK.  And you need to identify the

134
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
precise chemical group,
please, that tells me.  I saw you

135
00:11:28 --> 00:11:38
two first, so yes.

136
00:11:38 --> 00:11:43
What does the lower right mean?
Give me a name.  It's the?  There's

137
00:11:43 --> 00:11:49
a number there.
The?  Ah, we have a discrepancy of

138
00:11:49 --> 00:11:55
opinion here.  Someone says it's a 3
prime hydroxyl on the ribose and

139
00:11:55 --> 00:12:01
someone says it's the 2 prime
hydroxyl on the ribose.

140
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
Let's take a vote.
Who thinks that this is identified

141
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
as a ribose because of this 2 prime
hydroxyl?  Thank you.

142
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
And who believes it's the 3 prime
hydroxyl that identified riboses?

143
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
OK.  We have a smaller but firm
contingent.  In fact,

144
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
it's the 2 prime hydroxyl that
identifies this is ribose.

145
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
You remember, and you really need
to remember that this three prime

146
00:12:24 --> 00:12:28
hydroxyl is the reactive group that
allows the sugar phosphate backbone

147
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
to polymerize.
This 2 prime hydroxyl is a reactive

148
00:12:32 --> 00:12:38
group.  It identifies this as ribose
rather than deoxyribose,

149
00:12:38 --> 00:12:43
and it also is an additional
reactive group.

150
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
And the fact that it is a reactive
group makes RNA rather labile.

151
00:12:49 --> 00:12:54
OK?  So let's write a couple of
important things here.

152
00:12:54 --> 00:13:00
So this is RNA as the nucleic acid
polymer.

153
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
You should really know this.
Ribose has both a 3 prime hydroxyl

154
00:13:06 --> 00:13:13
and this 2 prime hydroxyl.
And this is a reactive group.

155
00:13:13 --> 00:13:19
And because of this RNA is a much
less stable polymer than DNA.

156
00:13:19 --> 00:13:26
Here's another one.  What type of
polynucleotide is this and how do

157
00:13:26 --> 00:13:33
you know?  Yes.
You.  OK.  It's RNA.

158
00:13:33 --> 00:13:41
And it's RNA we know because of
these uracil groups.

159
00:13:41 --> 00:13:49
OK?  So uracil is an alternate base
to thymine that's found only in RNA.

160
00:13:49 --> 00:13:57
Here are the Us.  It tells you it's
RNA.  OK?  So you need to know those

161
00:13:57 --> 00:14:07
facts about RNA.

162
00:14:07 --> 00:14:12
Good.  So let me pose a question to
you.  In this litany that you've had

163
00:14:12 --> 00:14:18
several times now where the flow of
information moves from DNA to RNA to

164
00:14:18 --> 00:14:24
protein, why is the RNA there?
This is a rhetorical question.

165
00:14:24 --> 00:14:30
I'm going to try to answer it for
you.

166
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
Why is the RNA there?
Why is there an RNA intermediate?

167
00:14:34 --> 00:14:47
You could imagine that the DNA

168
00:14:47 --> 00:14:52
double helix could open up and that
nucleic acid could be directly

169
00:14:52 --> 00:14:57
translated or could be directly
converted or the code could be

170
00:14:57 --> 00:15:03
changed to form a protein without
any RNA intermediate.

171
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
But, in fact, universally throughout
biology, throughout our world anyway,

172
00:15:07 --> 00:15:12
throughout our earth,
RNA is there as an intermediate.

173
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
Why?  Well, I think the answer
actually lies in evolution.

174
00:15:16 --> 00:15:21
RNA is probably the most ancient of
the information polymers.

175
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
That is widely believed now.
So RNA is ancient.  It was the

176
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
first, strongly believed now that it
was the first information

177
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
carrying polymer.
RNAs themselves were catalytic.

178
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
They became able to replicate.  And
they also probably became able to be

179
00:15:39 --> 00:15:43
translated into protein before DNA
was invented.  OK?

180
00:15:43 --> 00:15:47
So DNA's chemical structure is
different and it's a derivative of

181
00:15:47 --> 00:15:52
ribonucleic acid,
and undoubtedly came second.

182
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
There was an advantage of having
DNA because it's so much more stable,

183
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
and it made the hereditary material
much more stable and much more

184
00:16:00 --> 00:16:05
faithfully transmitted from
generation to generation.

185
00:16:05 --> 00:16:10
So RNA was ancient.
And the relationship between RNA

186
00:16:10 --> 00:16:15
and protein is probably a very old
one, and we'll talk about this

187
00:16:15 --> 00:16:20
relationship next lecture.
And I believe that that

188
00:16:20 --> 00:16:25
relationship has persisted,
and then DNA was kind of an add-on.

189
00:16:25 --> 00:16:30
And the DNA to RNA to protein does
not necessarily reflect the only way

190
00:16:30 --> 00:16:36
or the best way to do things.
Evolution is a capitalization of

191
00:16:36 --> 00:16:42
various changes.
And RNA to DNA, DNA to RNA to

192
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
protein is how things work now.
But this, I think, is a consequence

193
00:16:48 --> 00:16:54
of the evolutionary past.
Now, however, in our modern world

194
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
RNA serves two main purposes.
One of the things it does is to

195
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
allow one to use just a subset of
the genes to make proteins.

196
00:17:03 --> 00:17:08
So, as you've been told several
times, you and I have about 30,

197
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
00 genes in our genomes.  Not all of
those genes, and we will discuss

198
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
this in great depth as the course
goes on.  Not all of those genes are

199
00:17:17 --> 00:17:22
used at any one time.
We use just a subset of the genes.

200
00:17:22 --> 00:17:27
And having them converted into an

201
00:17:27 --> 00:17:32
RNA intermediate is one of the ways
that you can allow just a subset of

202
00:17:32 --> 00:17:38
the genes to be used.
So I'm going to write here subset.

203
00:17:38 --> 00:17:54
Subset of gene usage.

204
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
OK?  Because you can turn just some
of those genes,

205
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
or you can convert some of those
genes into RNA,

206
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
the information in some of those
genes into RNA.

207
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
And the other thing it lets you do
is to amplify the signal from each

208
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
gene.  So there are two copies of
each gene in a diploid cell.

209
00:18:12 --> 00:18:17
When it comes to RNA there can be
up to 10,000 copies of RNA per cell

210
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
of a particular RNA.
OK?  So you can get an

211
00:18:21 --> 00:18:34
amplification of the signal --

212
00:18:34 --> 00:18:42
-- from each gene.
RNA copy number per cell ranges

213
00:18:42 --> 00:18:50
from about one copy to about 10,
00, that's rare, copies per cell.

214
00:18:50 --> 00:18:59
All right.  So here we are.  Why
RNA? We've dealt with that.

215
00:18:59 --> 00:19:02
So I want to talk to you about two
things.  I want to talk to you about

216
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
synthesizing the RNA,
and then I'm going to talk to you

217
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
about modifying the RNA a bit.
And the first thing I want to cover

218
00:19:10 --> 00:19:18
is something called transcription.

219
00:19:18 --> 00:19:22
Which is also known as RNA synthesis.
And you all should have this

220
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
handout.  So I'm not going to draw
it but I will write some salient

221
00:19:26 --> 00:19:35
features on the board for you.

222
00:19:35 --> 00:19:42
And we're not quite ready to use
that.  I'm going to leave this up

223
00:19:42 --> 00:19:49
here, but I'm going to work on the
board for a little bit.

224
00:19:49 --> 00:19:56
The basic idea behind transcription,
RNA synthesis,

225
00:19:56 --> 00:20:04
is that one copies a DNA template
into a complementary RNA strand,

226
00:20:04 --> 00:20:09
complementary RNA.
And one does this,

227
00:20:09 --> 00:20:13
as I've alluded to,
only from the genes.

228
00:20:13 --> 00:20:24
And this is an interesting point

229
00:20:24 --> 00:20:31
because although you have 30,
00 genes in your genome, in fact,

230
00:20:31 --> 00:20:37
those 30,000 genes only take up
about 5% of the total amount of DNA

231
00:20:37 --> 00:20:44
in each of your cells.
So 5% of your total DNA of your

232
00:20:44 --> 00:20:51
genome comprises the genes,
the information carrying entities in

233
00:20:51 --> 00:20:58
your DNA.  And the rest
is other stuff.

234
00:20:58 --> 00:21:03
So the 95% is not genes.
It consists of various repeats,

235
00:21:03 --> 00:21:09
repetitive DNA that can be there at
just a few copies per genome or at

236
00:21:09 --> 00:21:14
10,000 copies per genome.
They can be real little, 10 base

237
00:21:14 --> 00:21:20
pairs, six base pair repeats,
or they can be a few kilo bases

238
00:21:20 --> 00:21:25
repeated many times.
Oris, Origins of Replication that

239
00:21:25 --> 00:21:31
you talked about last
time are not genes.

240
00:21:31 --> 00:21:36
Those are there,
too.  Centromeres,

241
00:21:36 --> 00:21:42
the middles of chromosomes.
Telomeres, the ends of chromosomes.

242
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
All of these things are not genes,
and they comprise the bulk of your

243
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
DNA.  Now, this isn't true in all
organisms.  OK?

244
00:21:53 --> 00:21:59
Some organisms have got very little
of this repetitive extra DNA.

245
00:21:59 --> 00:22:06
We happen to have a great deal of it.
OK.  So let's pursue this a bit

246
00:22:06 --> 00:22:14
more.  And let's think a bit more
about these genes.

247
00:22:14 --> 00:22:22
And in particular let's think about
the kinds of RNAs that those genes

248
00:22:22 --> 00:22:30
make.  So I'm going to talk about
gene classes or classes.

249
00:22:30 --> 00:22:37
And this is with respect to the RNA
and the functional RNA that comes

250
00:22:37 --> 00:22:44
from those sets of genes.
And I want to distinguish two major

251
00:22:44 --> 00:22:52
classes of genes.
The first are the protein encoding

252
00:22:52 --> 00:22:59
genes.  And protein encoding genes
move through a type of RNA that is

253
00:22:59 --> 00:23:07
called messenger RNA,
abbreviated mRNA.

254
00:23:07 --> 00:23:16
Messenger RNAs comprise about 1% of
the total amount of RNA in a cell.

255
00:23:16 --> 00:23:25
And they can range in size from
let's say 100 base pairs to 10,

256
00:23:25 --> 00:23:32
00 base pairs.  OK?
So there's a very wide size range.

257
00:23:32 --> 00:23:38
No, not base pairs.  Yell at me.
Why not base pairs?

258
00:23:38 --> 00:23:43
Why was I wrong saying base pairs?
Tell me about RNA.  Raise your hand.

259
00:23:43 --> 00:23:49
This is worth a frog.
I caught myself, but if you can

260
00:23:49 --> 00:23:54
catch me, too.
Yes.  You.  Good.

261
00:23:54 --> 00:24:00
OK.  Generally RNA is single,
woops.

262
00:24:00 --> 00:24:04
RNA is single-stranded.
It does not form, it can form a

263
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
double helix, OK?
It's not as stable as the DNA

264
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
double helix, and many RNAs,
probably most RNAs have some

265
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
double-strandedness to them,
but that is an intromolecular double

266
00:24:16 --> 00:24:20
strand in this.
There are some RNAs that form

267
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
intermolecular double strands,
but in generally I'm going to assume

268
00:24:24 --> 00:24:28
that RNAs are single-stranded.
So we talk about 100 bases rather

269
00:24:28 --> 00:24:33
than 100 base pairs.
OK?  Second class of genes are the

270
00:24:33 --> 00:24:39
ones that do not code for protein,
and in this case the RNA is the

271
00:24:39 --> 00:24:45
final product.
And this litany of DNA to RNA to

272
00:24:45 --> 00:24:51
protein doesn't hold.
You just stop at the RNA.

273
00:24:51 --> 00:24:58
And the RNA is the functional thing.
So here RNA is the final product.

274
00:24:58 --> 00:25:06
And we can break these into a bunch

275
00:25:06 --> 00:25:12
of different classes.
Ribosomal RNAs, abbreviated rRNA

276
00:25:12 --> 00:25:19
are a very abundant class of RNA
that comprise about,

277
00:25:19 --> 00:25:25
I've moved over here,
let me move here, 98% of total RNA.

278
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
And there are a few thousand bases
in length that say 2,

279
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
00 to 4,000 bases in length.
OK?  So this is 98% ribosomal RNA.

280
00:25:37 --> 00:25:42
This is fascinating.  I'll tell you
next time.  This is the RNA that

281
00:25:42 --> 00:25:47
comprises a very large proportion of
the ribosome that is the factory

282
00:25:47 --> 00:25:52
that makes the proteins.
OK?  And so I will tell you more

283
00:25:52 --> 00:25:57
about these next time.
Some other ones, tRNA,

284
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
the T for transfer RNA.
tRNA comprise about 1% of all RNA

285
00:26:03 --> 00:26:11
and are about 100 base pairs,
100 bases long.  OK? And then an

286
00:26:11 --> 00:26:19
interesting one that MIT has had a
huge role in discovering and

287
00:26:19 --> 00:26:27
studying, these things called micro
RNAs, abbreviated miRNAs,

288
00:26:27 --> 00:26:35
which are, they're at relatively low
abundance.

289
00:26:35 --> 00:26:43
Less than 1% of total RNAs.
And these are small.  In their

290
00:26:43 --> 00:26:51
mature form they're about 22 bases
in length.  OK.

291
00:26:51 --> 00:27:00
So now, and I believe I cannot do
anything with these boards.

292
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03
Ah, I can do something with this one,
but that one is stuck.

293
00:27:03 --> 00:27:07
All right.  So I'm going to do
something with this one.

294
00:27:07 --> 00:27:10
And then I'm afraid it's going to
disappear, but it's not going to

295
00:27:10 --> 00:27:14
matter because you have the handout
in front of you.

296
00:27:14 --> 00:27:18
So now I'm ready to move on with
you to the basic idea of

297
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
transcription.
And I'm going to write some facts

298
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
on the board, and we're going to
look at these cartoons that I drew

299
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
for you together because I think
your book is kind of difficult.

300
00:27:29 --> 00:27:36
So I decided to draw some cartoons
to help you with the basic idea.

301
00:27:36 --> 00:27:44
Transcription or RNA synthesis
takes place in the nucleus.

302
00:27:44 --> 00:27:59
Anyone else need a handout?

303
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
Why don't you come on down.
Actually, one of the TAs, could you

304
00:28:05 --> 00:28:11
be an emissary and just hand out to
those people with raised hands?

305
00:28:11 --> 00:28:18
Thanks.  Transcription takes place
in the nucleus.

306
00:28:18 --> 00:28:24
And the idea is really analogous to
DNA replication with a difference.

307
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
The analogy is the synthesis of a
complementary strand of nucleic acid

308
00:28:30 --> 00:28:37
on a template strand.
So this is an enormously important

309
00:28:37 --> 00:28:43
principle that you need to have.
Super important that you get the

310
00:28:43 --> 00:28:50
principle.  The basic idea involves
synthesis of a complementary strand

311
00:28:50 --> 00:28:57
of nucleic acid from a template
strand.  The template,

312
00:28:57 --> 00:29:04
actually, let me start even earlier
than that.

313
00:29:04 --> 00:29:09
We start with a gene that generally
comprises double-stranded DNA.

314
00:29:09 --> 00:29:14
There are exceptions to almost
everything that I will tell you,

315
00:29:14 --> 00:29:19
or that Professor Jacks will tell
you.  You should understand that

316
00:29:19 --> 00:29:25
there are exceptions.
Some organisms, particularly

317
00:29:25 --> 00:29:30
viruses have genomes that are RNA
that can be single-stranded or

318
00:29:30 --> 00:29:35
double-stranded RNA.
Some have genomes that are

319
00:29:35 --> 00:29:40
single-stranded DNA.
But in general most genomes are

320
00:29:40 --> 00:29:45
double-stranded DNA.
And the deal is this.

321
00:29:45 --> 00:29:50
The double-stranded DNA separates
its strands, and one of the strands,

322
00:29:50 --> 00:29:55
and this is the difference between
DNA replication and transcription,

323
00:29:55 --> 00:30:01
one of the strands becomes the
template strand.

324
00:30:01 --> 00:30:14
And this template is copied to form

325
00:30:14 --> 00:30:22
a complementary strand.
And it's copied by an enzyme called

326
00:30:22 --> 00:30:31
RNA polymerase.
So RNA polymerase synthesizes the

327
00:30:31 --> 00:30:40
complementary strand to
the template strand.

328
00:30:40 --> 00:30:45
complementary strand.
And it does so, of course,

329
00:30:45 --> 00:30:51
as RNA, because we're talking about
RNA synthesis and this is RNA

330
00:30:51 --> 00:30:57
polymerase.  It does not,
unlike DNA polymerization,

331
00:30:57 --> 00:31:03
require a primer.  So this does not
require a primer.

332
00:31:03 --> 00:31:07
OK.  You should know,
and it should be getting deep within

333
00:31:07 --> 00:31:11
your neural circuitry that
polymerization occurs by adding

334
00:31:11 --> 00:31:15
nucleotides to the 3 prime end of
the growing polymer.

335
00:31:15 --> 00:31:20
Yes.  If that didn't make,
you know, if you didn't say "yeah"

336
00:31:20 --> 00:31:24
to that, go back and think about it,
go back and look at problem sets and

337
00:31:24 --> 00:31:28
you'll get more practice in this.
But you really need to know that

338
00:31:28 --> 00:31:33
the growing chain adds
onto the 3 prime end.

339
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
OK.  So after the polymer,
after the RNA polymer is made the

340
00:31:39 --> 00:31:46
RNA is released from the template
strand.  As its being transcribed it

341
00:31:46 --> 00:31:52
forms this complementary strand.
And, as you know, complementary

342
00:31:52 --> 00:31:59
strands can base pair.
After it's made it is released from

343
00:31:59 --> 00:32:05
the template.
And it usually then goes into the

344
00:32:05 --> 00:32:09
cytoplasm where it does its thing.
So if you look at the diagram I

345
00:32:09 --> 00:32:13
gave you, that's what's up here,
here's your double-stranded DNA,

346
00:32:13 --> 00:32:17
your gene.  The strands separate.
One strand is transcribed into RNA.

347
00:32:17 --> 00:32:21
The RNA is release.  Obviously,
your double-stranded template,

348
00:32:21 --> 00:32:25
or what was your double-stranded
template will reform

349
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
its double strand.
So perhaps that's not so obvious,

350
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
but the double-stranded, originally
double-stranded template will reform

351
00:32:36 --> 00:32:41
its double strands,
thus released RNA, then goes into

352
00:32:41 --> 00:32:47
the cytoplasm where it is translated
into protein, or where the RNA is

353
00:32:47 --> 00:32:53
the final product.
So let's look at that in a bit more

354
00:32:53 --> 00:32:58
detail.
I've got here a template strand

355
00:32:58 --> 00:33:03
shown in red.  This is,
again, the second picture in the

356
00:33:03 --> 00:33:09
handout in front of you.
And I've got three features added

357
00:33:09 --> 00:33:14
here.  I have got a precise start
site of transcription.

358
00:33:14 --> 00:33:19
I've indicated elongation where the
polymer is elongating.

359
00:33:19 --> 00:33:24
And I have a precise termination
site where transcription ends.

360
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
OK?  Now, let me see what I have
here.

361
00:33:30 --> 00:33:35
I have a movie here.
Watch the movie.  I'll show it to

362
00:33:35 --> 00:33:41
you once, and then you can go and
watch it at your leisure.

363
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
This is meant to be RNA polymerase.
There's the helix opening up

364
00:33:47 --> 00:33:53
locally.  Here are ribonucleotide
triphosphates coming in,

365
00:33:53 --> 00:33:59
and RNA polymerase is catalyzing
their synthesis.  OK?

366
00:33:59 --> 00:34:03
So the template strand is the bottom
and here is the RNA being released.

367
00:34:03 --> 00:34:08
There's RNA polymerase moving along
the helix.  And the depiction is

368
00:34:08 --> 00:34:13
that the helix is opening locally
and then closing again behind the

369
00:34:13 --> 00:34:18
RNA polymerase.
At transcription termination,

370
00:34:18 --> 00:34:23
the helix, the gene helix zips up
again and the transcript is released.

371
00:34:23 --> 00:34:28
So this is a very much
simplified story.

372
00:34:28 --> 00:34:32
But is the basic principle of
transcription.

373
00:34:32 --> 00:34:37
And you should know it.
And in particular I have put onto

374
00:34:37 --> 00:34:41
this second diagram,
and because you have him in front of

375
00:34:41 --> 00:34:46
you I'm not going to write this on
the board, I'm going to use this as

376
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
something to tell you,
I have put the directionality of the

377
00:34:50 --> 00:34:55
strands of the double-helix on this
diagram.  This should be something

378
00:34:55 --> 00:35:00
you can deal with.
5 prime to 3 prime on one strand.

379
00:35:00 --> 00:35:04
The other strand is anti-parallel.
RNA, any nucleic acid is

380
00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
synthesized by adding onto the 3
prime end.  And that newly

381
00:35:08 --> 00:35:12
synthesizing nucleic acid polymer is
anti-parallel to the template.

382
00:35:12 --> 00:35:16
This is also something that you
should be familiar with.

383
00:35:16 --> 00:35:20
And you will have, will have,
have not yet, will have practice on

384
00:35:20 --> 00:35:24
doing this kind of polymerization,
but it should be something you

385
00:35:24 --> 00:35:28
really, really should be familiar
with, this anti-parallel

386
00:35:28 --> 00:35:32
requirement.
So, in fact, you can tell the

387
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
direction of transcription because
of the directionality of the

388
00:35:36 --> 00:35:40
template strand.
OK.  So this is very important for

389
00:35:40 --> 00:35:45
you to go and think about after
class the directionality of the

390
00:35:45 --> 00:35:49
template and of the newly
synthesized polymer.

391
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
These are some diagrams from your
book, and you can go and look at

392
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
them.  I'm not going to dwell on
them.  They indicate the different

393
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
between, or the steps in
transcription initiation,

394
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
elongation and termination.
And I've put them up there just to

395
00:36:06 --> 00:36:10
tell you there are these diagrams in
your book and you can go and take a

396
00:36:10 --> 00:36:14
look at them and read the
accompanying text.

397
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
OK.  So I see three problems with
transcription that are very

398
00:36:18 --> 00:36:28
interesting problems.

399
00:36:28 --> 00:36:33
One is how to find the genes.
I'll write them on the board and

400
00:36:33 --> 00:36:43
then we'll go through them.

401
00:36:43 --> 00:36:47
5% of the genome is genes.
That's most of it that is not genes.

402
00:36:47 --> 00:36:51
How does the transcription enzyme,
how does the RNA polymerase know

403
00:36:51 --> 00:36:56
which is a gene and which is not a
gene?  How does it know,

404
00:36:56 --> 00:37:00
even if it finds the gene,
which strand is the template strand

405
00:37:00 --> 00:37:05
and which is not the
template strand?

406
00:37:05 --> 00:37:08
I could have drawn your previous
diagram where the top strand was the

407
00:37:08 --> 00:37:11
template, and that what would have
happened would be that the RNA

408
00:37:11 --> 00:37:15
synthesis went in the other
direction.  So which strand

409
00:37:15 --> 00:37:31
is the template?

410
00:37:31 --> 00:37:38
And that also gives you the
direction, of course,

411
00:37:38 --> 00:37:46
of transcription.  And the third one
I'm going to write,

412
00:37:46 --> 00:37:54
and then I'll tell you about this in
a moment.  I'm going to write how to

413
00:37:54 --> 00:38:00
unwrap chromatin.  OK.
So in each of your cells,

414
00:38:00 --> 00:38:05
you have to look at me for this.
In each of your cells there is this

415
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
length of DNA.
One meter.  This is a little over,

416
00:38:11 --> 00:38:16
but one meter of DNA.  How big is
the average cell in diameter?

417
00:38:16 --> 00:38:21
Give it to me in micrometers.
Worth a frog.  On average.  Well,

418
00:38:21 --> 00:38:27
that's actually a really big cell.
It's about ten times

419
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
less than that.
But whoever that was,

420
00:38:32 --> 00:38:36
who was it?  No way.  These are very
bad to throw.  Very bad to throw.

421
00:38:36 --> 00:38:41
You can have it because you caught
it.  See me afterwards.

422
00:38:41 --> 00:38:46
I'll give you one.  OK.
[LAUGHTER]  OK.  So how do you pack

423
00:38:46 --> 00:38:50
a meter of DNA into a cell that is
about ten microns in diameter?

424
00:38:50 --> 00:38:55
OK.  So, OK, Jamie, you want to
hazard an answer here?

425
00:38:55 --> 00:39:06
Your hand was up.

426
00:39:06 --> 00:39:10
OK.  Good.  You can wind it up.
OK.  The other thing you have to do,

427
00:39:10 --> 00:39:14
of course, is to make it really thin.
It has to be a lot thinner than my

428
00:39:14 --> 00:39:18
piece of rope.
But once you've made it really thin

429
00:39:18 --> 00:39:22
you can then wind it up.
OK.  It's logical and this is how

430
00:39:22 --> 00:39:26
it's done.  And you can wind it up
and then it will fit into

431
00:39:26 --> 00:39:31
your ten micron cell.
Now, in actual fact,

432
00:39:31 --> 00:39:36
there's a whole process to do that.
And I'm going to go through them as

433
00:39:36 --> 00:39:41
we go through these problems here.
So here is problem one exemplified.

434
00:39:41 --> 00:39:46
I've got red little dots for each
of the genes.  How does RNA

435
00:39:46 --> 00:39:51
polymerase find these genes in this
vast amount of DNA that is not genes?

436
00:39:51 --> 00:39:56
Here's the other one.
Which strand is the template?

437
00:39:56 --> 00:40:01
Oh.
And here is a nice problem that in

438
00:40:01 --> 00:40:05
the interest of time I am not going
to do here in class with you,

439
00:40:05 --> 00:40:10
but I want you guys to go and do
this as an exercise.

440
00:40:10 --> 00:40:14
I will tell you that the answer is
not on your handout on the Web.

441
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
I took it off.  Sneaky, ha?  So
that you can go and think about this.

442
00:40:18 --> 00:40:23
I want you to go and understand
that the products of synthesis from

443
00:40:23 --> 00:40:27
either strand of a DNA
double-stranded helix

444
00:40:27 --> 00:40:32
are not the same.
OK?  And I'm going to zip through

445
00:40:32 --> 00:40:37
this because I want to move on here.
OK.  And I want to move to problem

446
00:40:37 --> 00:40:42
three which is this thing I called
chromatin.  DNA is wound up around

447
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
proteins.  These are called histones,
and we'll have more to say about

448
00:40:46 --> 00:40:51
them later in the course.
And wound up and wound up and wound

449
00:40:51 --> 00:40:56
up.  And there is a very set number
and type of proteins that the DNA is

450
00:40:56 --> 00:41:01
wound around.
And once the DNA has been wound

451
00:41:01 --> 00:41:05
around once, those DNA protein
complexes are wound up some more,

452
00:41:05 --> 00:41:10
and then wound up some more.  And
eventually you get them wound up and

453
00:41:10 --> 00:41:14
wrapped up so much you get the
characteristic rather large

454
00:41:14 --> 00:41:19
chromosomes which are very much
packed DNA.  Now,

455
00:41:19 --> 00:41:23
this is a great way to fit DNA into
a cell.  However,

456
00:41:23 --> 00:41:28
this wrapping up of the chromatin
into, the wrapping up of the DNA

457
00:41:28 --> 00:41:33
into this chromatin structure
inhibits transcription.

458
00:41:33 --> 00:41:37
And in order to allow transcription
to proceed, you have to remove these

459
00:41:37 --> 00:41:42
proteins from the DNA and allow it
to unwind locally.

460
00:41:42 --> 00:41:47
And that takes a whole series of
enzymatic steps,

461
00:41:47 --> 00:41:51
again that we'll explore more later
in the course.

462
00:41:51 --> 00:41:56
But the problem I throw out at you
now is hw do you unwrap the

463
00:41:56 --> 00:42:01
chromatin where transcription is
needed?  And the answer to all of

464
00:42:01 --> 00:42:06
these things lies in a
specific, no, stop.

465
00:42:06 --> 00:42:11
Stop. Down.  Up.
OK.  The answer to all of these

466
00:42:11 --> 00:42:17
questions lies in a specific DNA
sequence or a series of specific DNA

467
00:42:17 --> 00:42:23
sequences that are collectively
called --

468
00:42:23 --> 00:42:34
-- the promoter.

469
00:42:34 --> 00:42:41
Here's another one.
What is a promoter?  And I need to

470
00:42:41 --> 00:42:49
make the distinction now between
transcribed DNA of a gene and

471
00:42:49 --> 00:42:56
untranscribed DNA of a gene.
The promoter is part of a gene but

472
00:42:56 --> 00:43:03
it is not transcribed.
It usually depends on the gene and

473
00:43:03 --> 00:43:09
the type of gene.
It usually lies 5 prime to the

474
00:43:09 --> 00:43:16
transcriptional start site.
And it is a DNA sequence that says

475
00:43:16 --> 00:43:23
this is a gene,
and it also says transcription

476
00:43:23 --> 00:43:30
should proceed in this
direction.  OK.

477
00:43:30 --> 00:43:34
And the way it does these things,
I'm going to each of the answers to

478
00:43:34 --> 00:43:39
each of the problems now,
is that it binds proteins that

479
00:43:39 --> 00:43:44
specifically recognize the sequence
of the promoter.

480
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
So you talked about the DNA
replication origin and proteins that

481
00:43:48 --> 00:43:53
specifically recognize the
nucleotide sequence of the origin.

482
00:43:53 --> 00:43:58
This is analogous.  There are
proteins that recognize promoter

483
00:43:58 --> 00:44:03
sequences which are similar but not
identical from gene to gene.

484
00:44:03 --> 00:44:09
So it binds proteins.
And these are called transcription

485
00:44:09 --> 00:44:21
factors.

486
00:44:21 --> 00:44:25
And these transcription factors bind
in a DNA sequence specific way.

487
00:44:25 --> 00:44:30
OK.  It also binds RNA polymerase
which I'm going to abbreviate RNA

488
00:44:30 --> 00:44:37
polymerase, RNA pol.
OK?  And the answers to the three

489
00:44:37 --> 00:44:46
questions are that firstly the
protein-DNA interaction is sequence

490
00:44:46 --> 00:44:55
specific, sequence specific,
and so this allows you to actually

491
00:44:55 --> 00:45:02
find the genes.
Secondly, and this is cool and I'll

492
00:45:02 --> 00:45:07
show you a picture of this in a
moment, the proteins interact with a

493
00:45:07 --> 00:45:12
promoter DNA differently on
different strands of the helix so

494
00:45:12 --> 00:45:17
they bind asymmetrically.
They may bind more to one strand

495
00:45:17 --> 00:45:22
than to the other strand.
And this gives directionality to

496
00:45:22 --> 00:45:27
the transcription so the protein
binding is asymmetric

497
00:45:27 --> 00:45:36
or strand specific.

498
00:45:36 --> 00:45:41
Not for all of these proteins but
for a significant number.

499
00:45:41 --> 00:45:46
And that helps you decide which
strand you're going to use as the

500
00:45:46 --> 00:45:52
template.  And thirdly these
proteins have got associated with

501
00:45:52 --> 00:45:57
them activities that will unwrap the
chromatin, that will unwrap the DNA

502
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
from its protein complexes and allow
it to be accessible to the

503
00:46:03 --> 00:46:16
transcription machinery.

504
00:46:16 --> 00:46:20
OK.  Let's zip so I can show you
this.  You can look at this on your

505
00:46:20 --> 00:46:25
slides.  Here are some pictures from
your book.  Really important in this,

506
00:46:25 --> 00:46:30
don't move.  Really important in
this is a protein called TF2D which

507
00:46:30 --> 00:46:35
recognizes a sequence called,
that goes T-A-T-A-A-A.

508
00:46:35 --> 00:46:40
This is called the TATA binding
protein.  And it's really important.

509
00:46:40 --> 00:46:45
And it's the one thing that, the
major thing that gives asymmetry to

510
00:46:45 --> 00:46:50
this transcription,
set of transcription factors on the

511
00:46:50 --> 00:46:55
promoter.  Once TF2D has bound to
the promoter, other proteins come

512
00:46:55 --> 00:47:01
along, including these various other
things called BFHG and so on.

513
00:47:01 --> 00:47:05
And here's RNA polymerase.
And you can see this complex

514
00:47:05 --> 00:47:10
positioned asymmetrically on the DNA.
And this complex you should know

515
00:47:10 --> 00:47:15
the name of, I'm going to put it in
its own box here, is the

516
00:47:15 --> 00:47:23
initiation complex.

517
00:47:23 --> 00:47:28
And I want to show you a
crystallographic rendition of the

518
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
TATA binding protein called TBP,
also sometimes called TF2D.  But

519
00:47:34 --> 00:47:40
TATA binding protein here shown in
purple.  And if you look here,

520
00:47:40 --> 00:47:45
you're looking head on at the double
helix.  OK?  Here's the helix.

521
00:47:45 --> 00:47:51
You're looking down the helix.
And you can see that this protein

522
00:47:51 --> 00:47:57
is positioned on just one side of
the helix, so that gives

523
00:47:57 --> 00:48:02
you asymmetry.
Here's another transcription factor

524
00:48:02 --> 00:48:06
bound to DNA.  This is a protein
called GAL-4.  It binds as a dimer.

525
00:48:06 --> 00:48:11
And you can see that GAL4 is the
blue.  And here it is contacting

526
00:48:11 --> 00:48:15
just one side,
one strand of this red double helix.

527
00:48:15 --> 00:48:20
And I'm going to stop there and
finish off the last little

528
00:48:20 --> 00:48:23
bit on Monday.
