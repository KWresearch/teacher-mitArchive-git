1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
So we're going to start by talking
about this story.

2
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
This is a famous moment in the
treatment of infectious diseases and

3
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
the prevention of infectious
diseases.

4
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
This is the first human vaccination,
at least the first purposeful human

5
00:00:34 --> 00:00:39
vaccination where the famous British
doctor, Edward Jenner,

6
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
is vaccinating a child for the
prevention of smallpox,

7
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
a devastating disease at that time
and for centuries before that time

8
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
which would wipe out literally
millions of people due to its very

9
00:00:54 --> 00:00:59
aggressive nature.
Not everybody who died or was

10
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
infected by smallpox would die from
it, but a lot of people did.

11
00:01:05 --> 00:01:11
And it was an important infectious
agent throughout the world,

12
00:01:11 --> 00:01:16
actually brought, for example,
by colonizing troops in Mexico and

13
00:01:16 --> 00:01:22
wiped out Native peoples there,
used purposely as a biological agent

14
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
in warfare.  Smallpox was used by
the British to suppress Native

15
00:01:28 --> 00:01:33
Americans in warfare.
In fact, the town of Amherst,

16
00:01:33 --> 00:01:38
Massachusetts was named after
Jeffrey Amherst,

17
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
I think, who was an officer in the
British Army whom ordered that

18
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
smallpox infected blankets,
or blankets from smallpox infected

19
00:01:47 --> 00:01:52
individuals be sent as a gift to
Indian tribes in the region so as to

20
00:01:52 --> 00:01:57
spread the disease to them thereby
limiting their ability to fight in

21
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
an oncoming war.
So this is an important agent,

22
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
and this is an important moment in
the treatment and prevention of this

23
00:02:07 --> 00:02:12
particular agent.
So I want to tell you this story

24
00:02:12 --> 00:02:17
because it illustrates some
important points about immunology.

25
00:02:17 --> 00:02:22
Edward Jenner, who as you see, was
doing this work in the late 1700s,

26
00:02:22 --> 00:02:27
made two important observations.
One was that milkmaids,

27
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
people who got milk from cows,
milkmaids had smooth skin.

28
00:02:33 --> 00:02:40
And that was unusual in the time,

29
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
because most people had been
infected by this agent smallpox,

30
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
developed the smallpox disease which
led to a pocking of their skin if

31
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
they survived.
So most people did not have smooth

32
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
skin, but milkmaids had surprisingly
smooth skin.  One wonders what was

33
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
behind this observation by Jenner,
but it doesn't really matter.

34
00:03:00 --> 00:03:05
He also noticed that milkmaids had
previously been exposed,

35
00:03:05 --> 00:03:11
in many instances, to a related
disease of cows called cowpox.

36
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
And this was manifested on their
hands, they developed sores on their

37
00:03:17 --> 00:03:23
hands, but it didn't progress into a
disease that looked

38
00:03:23 --> 00:03:30
like smallpox.
And so Jenner made a hypothesis that

39
00:03:30 --> 00:03:39
prior exposure to cowpox,
whatever the agent was that caused

40
00:03:39 --> 00:03:49
cowpox, prior exposure to cowpox
protected against smallpox.

41
00:03:49 --> 00:03:58
And this was the suggestion of a
phenomenon known as immunological

42
00:03:58 --> 00:04:10
memory.

43
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
And it was well known by then that
you only got a disease once.

44
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
You only got exposed, if you got
exposed to a disease and developed

45
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
symptoms and recovered,
you were protected against getting

46
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
that disease in the future.
And this is a phenomenon of

47
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
immunological memory,
which we now understand in some

48
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
detail, and I'll tell you
how it all works.

49
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
But that was known already by then.
And so what Jenner said was that

50
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
maybe you develop immunological
memory to your cowpox exposure which

51
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
then protects you against smallpox.
Well, so that was the hypothesis.

52
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
He needed to do an experiment.
And the experiment is illustrated

53
00:04:44 --> 00:05:00
up there.

54
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
He started with a milkmaid by the
name of Sarah Nelms who had a cowpox

55
00:05:06 --> 00:05:15
sore on her hand.

56
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
He took that cowpox sore from her
hand and injected it into

57
00:05:20 --> 00:05:29
James Phipps --

58
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
-- who was a clueless neighbor's boy.
He just happened to live in the

59
00:05:33 --> 00:05:38
neighborhood wandering by one day
and where Jenner invited him in for

60
00:05:38 --> 00:05:43
some cocoa or something and said,
by the way, since you're here, let

61
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
me just inject you with some of this
stuff.  [LAUGHTER]  And that's

62
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
exactly what's depicted here.
Sarah Nelms is holding the boy and

63
00:05:53 --> 00:05:58
Jenner is injecting him with
some cowpox stuff.

64
00:05:58 --> 00:06:12
He then waited three weeks,
and he injected him with smallpox.

65
00:06:12 --> 00:06:22
A known lethal agent.

66
00:06:22 --> 00:06:34
He then waited six weeks and
injected him again.  [LAUGHTER]

67
00:06:34 --> 00:06:41
Then he waited and waited and waited.
And the kid was disease-free.

68
00:06:41 --> 00:06:49
He had, in fact, protected the boy
against the development of smallpox.

69
00:06:49 --> 00:06:58
The first purposeful vaccination.

70
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
It's called vaccination,
by the way, because cowpox,

71
00:07:03 --> 00:07:08
which is the agent used to vaccinate
the boy, is caused by a virus known

72
00:07:08 --> 00:07:13
as vaccinia.  So in honor of that,
the whole field, the whole approach

73
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
is called vaccination.
So this is an example of

74
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
introducing an agent which the body
then responds to.

75
00:07:23 --> 00:07:28
And based on the body's response to
that agent, the body is protected

76
00:07:28 --> 00:07:32
against further disease.
Now, this works because the agent

77
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
that was used to vaccinate the boy,
vaccinia is very similar to the

78
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
agent that causes smallpox.
It's not identical but it's

79
00:07:40 --> 00:07:44
sufficiently similar that the body's
response to that agent is compatible

80
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
with a response to the dangerous
agent.  This is called a

81
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
heterologous vaccine.
And I'll briefly mention other

82
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
vaccine strategies towards the end.
Jenner succeeded in doing this with

83
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
a number of patients directly
after that.

84
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
And he actually published his paper,
or he tried to publish a paper on

85
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
this finding in the early 1800s.
He was actually blocked from doing

86
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
so.  People didn't want to believe
it.  People were extremely nervous

87
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
about this approach.
It lead to editorials in local

88
00:08:16 --> 00:08:21
magazines such as shown here.
This is a cartoon of Jenner with

89
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
young James Phipps and a bunch of
people getting vaccinated with this

90
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
cow thing.  And the consequence,
as you might be able to see, is that

91
00:08:29 --> 00:08:33
these people are sprouting cows out
of their arms,

92
00:08:33 --> 00:08:38
out of their faces,
out of their butts.

93
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
And there was general nervousness
about tinkering with the natural

94
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
species in the world in this
deliberate way.

95
00:08:45 --> 00:08:49
But it was generally accepted,
used extensively in Europe and

96
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
actually in the United States.
And now it's sufficiently

97
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
successful, has been sufficiently
successful over the last couple of

98
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
centuries that smallpox is
no longer a problem.

99
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
It's been eradicated through proper
vaccination using this approach.

100
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
So there is no longer smallpox out
there, although there are vials of

101
00:09:09 --> 00:09:14
smallpox sitting in freezers which
have been a concern to governments

102
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
in the sense that bioterrorists
might get their hands on it.

103
00:09:18 --> 00:09:23
And there have actually been
efforts to bring back smallpox

104
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
vaccination as a protective against
the potential use of the smallpox

105
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
agent for some sort
of bioterrorism.

106
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
Do you have a question?
OK.  Now, as you know, vaccinations

107
00:09:36 --> 00:09:40
against viral agents and other
pathogens are commonplace.

108
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
You've all been vaccinated against
lots of things.

109
00:09:44 --> 00:09:49
They've changed the course of human
history in a dramatic way.

110
00:09:49 --> 00:09:53
This was not very long ago,
1952, a bunch of children who were

111
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
infected with polio virus.
It led to deaths of many kids and

112
00:09:57 --> 00:10:02
paralysis of many more.
And this is a picture in a hospital

113
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
ward of children in iron lungs,
which is how they were kept alive

114
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
because of their paralysis.
Many of them survived this early

115
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
phase but then went on to develop
paralysis in their extremities.

116
00:10:14 --> 00:10:19
And it was a very devastating
disease.  Fortunately,

117
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
both Drs. Sabin and Salk in the
early 1950s developed vaccines using

118
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
the principles laid out by Jenner
150 years before.  And these

119
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
were successful.
And so kids were treated with polio

120
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
vaccines for the next 30 or so years.
And polio itself was wiped out.

121
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
So there are no, or very, very few
examples of active polio outbreaks

122
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
these days.  And,
in fact, kids are not vaccinated

123
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
with polio vaccines in this country
because it's not a threat.

124
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
It's not that it's not a threat
worldwide.  In fact,

125
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
last year when I was teaching this
course we read that there were some

126
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
new outbreaks of polio.
So it's not that the virus is gone.

127
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
It hasn't been fully eradicated.
But it's very,

128
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
very uncommon thanks to these kinds
of efforts.  And we think about this

129
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
also again to protect against
deliberate use of pathogens.

130
00:11:10 --> 00:11:14
Here, Anthrax, I've shown you this
slide before.  So there are now

131
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
efforts to develop vaccines against
Anthrax.  In case somebody were to

132
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
use it as an agent,
you could protect people from

133
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
getting exposed to Anthrax.
And pathogens are important out

134
00:11:26 --> 00:11:30
there.
Many of the diseases that have been

135
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
scourges of humanity over the
millennia are due to pathogens.

136
00:11:34 --> 00:11:39
It's been a constant battle between
humans and pathogens,

137
00:11:39 --> 00:11:43
viruses, bacteria, other single-cell
organisms.  And our greatest hope

138
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
against controlling these infections
is to protect them through

139
00:11:47 --> 00:11:52
vaccination.  Where that's worked
it's been extremely successful.

140
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
Where it hasn't worked, like in the
case of HIV, it's been much

141
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
more problematic.
So vaccination in general,

142
00:12:01 --> 00:12:06
immunological response,
immunological memory are extremely

143
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
important.  OK.
So to understand what's happening

144
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
with respect to vaccination and
immunological memory,

145
00:12:16 --> 00:12:21
you have to think about what happens
in an infection and how your body

146
00:12:21 --> 00:12:26
responds to it.
So if you plot a time course of

147
00:12:26 --> 00:12:31
infection where this might be the
very earliest stages.

148
00:12:31 --> 00:12:42
When you get exposed to a pathogen,

149
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
virus, bacterium, it enters your
body and it begins to

150
00:12:46 --> 00:12:59
reproduce itself.

151
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
It will build up.
And it might peak in its

152
00:13:02 --> 00:13:08
concentrations at about a week or so,
maybe two weeks.

153
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
And it's at this stage where you're
developing symptoms.

154
00:13:14 --> 00:13:19
And those symptoms might be
sufficiently severe that it can

155
00:13:19 --> 00:13:25
cause death.  But if you live then
you observe typically that the

156
00:13:25 --> 00:13:31
pathogen concentrations drop and can
be eliminated all together within

157
00:13:31 --> 00:13:36
two or three weeks.
The reason that they drop is because

158
00:13:36 --> 00:13:41
your body is making defense
mechanisms against it in two forms,

159
00:13:41 --> 00:13:47
antibodies and specialized cells
called T cells that are built to

160
00:13:47 --> 00:13:52
eradicate the agent.
And so if you plot the

161
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
concentration of antibodies and T
cells that are active against this

162
00:13:57 --> 00:14:03
agent, you find that initially
there's a delay.

163
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
And then the concentrations of these
antibodies and T cells rises.

164
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
And as they do they are acting on
either the agent itself or the cells

165
00:14:11 --> 00:14:16
that the agent has infected.
And a combined activity then leads

166
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
to the elimination of those agents.
Concentrations stay up and then

167
00:14:20 --> 00:14:25
they fall, but they don't go to zero.
They stay around.

168
00:14:25 --> 00:14:30
You have low levels of these
specific antibody-producing cells or

169
00:14:30 --> 00:14:35
T cells that are directed against
this agent that stay in your blood

170
00:14:35 --> 00:14:40
forever such that if you get a
second infection,

171
00:14:40 --> 00:14:45
even years later, these cells are
already there set aside such that

172
00:14:45 --> 00:14:50
the response to that agent is very
rapid and the concentrations of the

173
00:14:50 --> 00:14:55
agent never rise very high.
So you're able to control it before

174
00:14:55 --> 00:15:01
the amounts of the agents build up
and cause symptoms or death.

175
00:15:01 --> 00:15:06
And that's why you don't develop
secondary infection.

176
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
This process is called
immunological memory.

177
00:15:12 --> 00:15:20
And, as I said,

178
00:15:20 --> 00:15:25
it's the setting aside of cells that
are specific to the thing that's

179
00:15:25 --> 00:15:30
causing the disease.
And we'll talk about how that

180
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
happens in a moment.
So this phase, I should have said,

181
00:15:35 --> 00:15:43
is called recovery.  OK.

182
00:15:43 --> 00:15:49
Now, I mentioned two cell types that
are important in this process.

183
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
There are B cells and T cells,
and they are the ones that I'm going

184
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01
to focus on.
But it's important for you to know

185
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
that they are not the only cells of
your immune system.

186
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
The body produces a whole series of
cells shown here in addition to B

187
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
cells and T cells and a specialized
form of B cells called plasma cells.

188
00:16:13 --> 00:16:17
And these cells also contribute to
your immune response.

189
00:16:17 --> 00:16:22
They're part of what's called the
innate immune response.

190
00:16:22 --> 00:16:31
And they act in a way that is

191
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
nonspecific.  So they recognize
classes of agents,

192
00:16:35 --> 00:16:40
viruses as a class or bacteria as a
class.  They recognize things that

193
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
are common to all viruses or most or
all bacteria or most.

194
00:16:44 --> 00:16:49
And they're very important in the
early phases of an infection.

195
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
And, in fact, in this first phase
where you're ramping up the antibody

196
00:16:53 --> 00:16:58
producing cells in the T cells,
it's those cells that are acting to

197
00:16:58 --> 00:17:03
help suppress the proliferation
of the agent.

198
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
And so this is where the innate
immune response is taking place.

199
00:17:07 --> 00:17:12
And Claudette will review for you
some of those cell types in the next

200
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
lecture.  We're going to focus on B
cells and T cells.

201
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
And they fall into what's called
the adaptive or specific

202
00:17:21 --> 00:17:38
immune response.

203
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
And that can be broken down,
as I said, into these two cell types.

204
00:17:42 --> 00:17:47
There are T cells which are T
lymphocytes.  And the T lymphocytes

205
00:17:47 --> 00:17:52
constitute what's called
cell-based immunity.

206
00:17:52 --> 00:18:01
It's the cells themselves that are

207
00:18:01 --> 00:18:08
participating in the eradication of
the agent.  And then there are B

208
00:18:08 --> 00:18:15
lymphocytes, and they participate in
what's called humoral which is also

209
00:18:15 --> 00:18:22
liquid phase immunity.
And what that means is that they're

210
00:18:22 --> 00:18:29
producing something that gets
secreted into the bodily fluids,

211
00:18:29 --> 00:18:34
blood or whatever.
And it's that which is participating

212
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
in the eradication of the agent.
In particular, what that is, is

213
00:18:38 --> 00:18:59
antibodies, as we'll talk about.

214
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
These cells have these names,
B cells and T cells, because where

215
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
they mature.  So both B lymphocytes
and T lymphocytes start off in the

216
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
bone marrow, or I should say the
precursors of these cells start off

217
00:19:17 --> 00:19:25
in the bone marrow.
The precursors to B lymphocytes make

218
00:19:25 --> 00:19:34
their way either to the spleen or
they stay in the bone marrow,

219
00:19:34 --> 00:19:44
and that's why they're called B
cells.  And they go on to make B

220
00:19:44 --> 00:19:53
lymphocytes, including these cells
called plasma cells, which

221
00:19:53 --> 00:20:05
produce antibodies.

222
00:20:05 --> 00:20:17
A separate precursor called the T
cell precursor makes its way to the

223
00:20:17 --> 00:20:29
thymus which is a lymphoid organ in
your chest, and there the cells

224
00:20:29 --> 00:20:41
mature into two types of T cells,
cytotoxic T cells, otherwise known

225
00:20:41 --> 00:20:53
as CTLs, or TC cells,
and helper T cells or TH cells.

226
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
OK?  And because they go to the
thymus they're called T cells.

227
00:20:57 --> 00:21:02
Now, these cells are
distinguishable based on the types

228
00:21:02 --> 00:21:07
of protective molecules
that they produce.

229
00:21:07 --> 00:21:11
This slide just shows you an
overview of the lymphoid system in

230
00:21:11 --> 00:21:15
your body emphasizing the points I
just made.  The bone marrow is

231
00:21:15 --> 00:21:20
important based on the origin of the
cells, as well as it's where B cells

232
00:21:20 --> 00:21:24
mature.  B cells also mature in the
spleen.  And here's the thymus where

233
00:21:24 --> 00:21:28
T cells mature.
And in green here you see the

234
00:21:28 --> 00:21:32
lymphatic system.
These are the vessels that carry

235
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
your lymph fluids where many of
these cells move to get to the sites

236
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
of infection.  And what's not so
obvious to see are lymph nodes,

237
00:21:40 --> 00:21:43
which is again where many of these
cells mature and turn into fully

238
00:21:43 --> 00:21:47
blown antibody producing cells or
matured T cells.

239
00:21:47 --> 00:21:51
I also want to point out that the
handout that you have has the wrong

240
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
numbers.  I was looking at least
year's book when I took

241
00:21:55 --> 00:21:59
these numbers down.
So the figures are what I'm showing

242
00:21:59 --> 00:22:03
you here.  And on the Web,
the version that's on the Web has

243
00:22:03 --> 00:22:07
been corrected,
so you might want to pay attention

244
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
to that.  Now,
what the antibodies that are

245
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
produced by B cells and the
molecules on the surface of T cells

246
00:22:16 --> 00:22:21
are recognizing are things
called antigens.

247
00:22:21 --> 00:22:36
Antigens are one of a number of

248
00:22:36 --> 00:22:46
different types of molecules,
lipids, carbohydrates, proteins,

249
00:22:46 --> 00:22:59
that are specific to the pathogen.

250
00:22:59 --> 00:23:02
And your body makes antibodies
produced by T cells,

251
00:23:02 --> 00:23:06
produced by B cells, as well as
proteins on the surface of T cells

252
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
that will specifically recognize
these antigens.

253
00:23:10 --> 00:23:14
And that's why it's called a
specific immune response,

254
00:23:14 --> 00:23:17
because the protein that the
lymphocytes are producing

255
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
specifically recognizes the antigen,
whether it be a lipid antigen, a

256
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
carbohydrate antigen or a protein
antigen.  And that's illustrated on

257
00:23:25 --> 00:23:29
this side where you have a virus
particle here or a secreted protein

258
00:23:29 --> 00:23:33
that might be floating
around in the blood.

259
00:23:33 --> 00:23:37
And you can see that there are bound
to it these colored structures.

260
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
These are antibodies.  And the
different colors are recognizing

261
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
different antigens.
So this orange colored antigen is

262
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
being recognized by that orange
colored antibody.

263
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
The purple colored antigen is being
recognized by the purple antibody.

264
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
Your body has an amazing ability to
generate tremendous diversity in the

265
00:23:57 --> 00:24:01
structures, these antibodies or T
cell receptors that recognize

266
00:24:01 --> 00:24:08
particular antigens.

267
00:24:08 --> 00:24:15
B cells, B lymphocytes start off by
producing on their surface antibody

268
00:24:15 --> 00:24:23
molecules.  These antibody molecules
are heterotetromers.

269
00:24:23 --> 00:24:32
They have two heavy chains and two

270
00:24:32 --> 00:24:41
light chains.  And we'll talk about
how those produced in a moment.

271
00:24:41 --> 00:24:50
B cells mature and they turn into
plasma cells.  And plasma cells

272
00:24:50 --> 00:25:00
secrete the antibody into
the bodily fluids.  OK?

273
00:25:00 --> 00:25:13
T cells have on their surface a
protein called the T cell receptor.

274
00:25:13 --> 00:25:20
And likewise it is very specific.

275
00:25:20 --> 00:25:24
Just like antibodies, as depicted
up here, have a particular sequence

276
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
at the end, which is the
antigen binding site.

277
00:25:28 --> 00:25:36
And no two antibodies produced by

278
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
different B cells would be the same
with respect to their antigen

279
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
binding site.  Likewise,
this region of the T cell receptor

280
00:25:44 --> 00:25:54
is unique.

281
00:25:54 --> 00:25:57
And, again, that's what gives
specificity to the immune system.

282
00:25:57 --> 00:26:01
There are B cells that produce
particular antibodies that recognize

283
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
particular antigens.
And T cells that have on their

284
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
surface T cell receptors that are
specific to particular antigens

285
00:26:08 --> 00:26:12
compared to other T cells.
This is a detail from your book

286
00:26:12 --> 00:26:16
which shows again an antibody
molecule.  You can see that it's a

287
00:26:16 --> 00:26:20
heterotetromer,
two heavy chains,

288
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
two light chains, and at the very
tips, both of these arms are these

289
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
antigen binding sites.
And, again, this is where the

290
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
diversity comes from.
This antibody,

291
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
with its particular structure,
will bind to this particular antigen

292
00:26:36 --> 00:26:40
because that antigen fits into the
pocket formed by that antigen

293
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
binding site specifically.
Likewise, on the surface of T cells

294
00:26:44 --> 00:26:48
there are T cell receptor proteins.
They're composed of two chains, an

295
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
alpha chain and a beta chain.
And the coming together of the

296
00:26:52 --> 00:26:56
alpha chain and the beta chain
produces, again,

297
00:26:56 --> 00:27:00
an antigen binding site that is
unique to that particular

298
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04
T cell receptor.
OK.  So this is interesting.

299
00:27:04 --> 00:27:10
And it raises an important question,
an important problem.

300
00:27:10 --> 00:27:16
There are lots of pathogens.
There are lots and lots and lots of

301
00:27:16 --> 00:27:22
things out there that can get into
your body and cause you harm.

302
00:27:22 --> 00:27:28
And, therefore, in order to
effectively fight those things you

303
00:27:28 --> 00:27:41
need many different antibodies --

304
00:27:41 --> 00:27:50
-- and many different T cell
receptors.  It's actually estimated

305
00:27:50 --> 00:27:59
that there are ten to the seventh
distinct B cells and T cells in your

306
00:27:59 --> 00:28:06
body at any time.
So you've got ten million different

307
00:28:06 --> 00:28:11
B cells and T cells that make
different antibodies or different T

308
00:28:11 --> 00:28:16
cell receptors on the surface.
So where does that diversity come

309
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
from?  How do you get ten million
different B cells or T cells in your

310
00:28:21 --> 00:28:26
body?  Well, one possibility would
be that there are ten million

311
00:28:26 --> 00:28:34
different genes.

312
00:28:34 --> 00:28:37
That there are ten million different
antibody genes or ten million

313
00:28:37 --> 00:28:41
different alpha genes and beta genes
in the T cell receptor.

314
00:28:41 --> 00:28:45
Is that the likely explanation?
How do you know it's not true?

315
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
Because I've already told you that
there are only 30,

316
00:28:48 --> 00:28:52
00 genes total throughout your
genome.  So there sure as hell

317
00:28:52 --> 00:28:56
aren't ten to the seventh different
antibody genes.  So that

318
00:28:56 --> 00:28:59
answer is wrong.
It could have been from

319
00:28:59 --> 00:29:08
alternative splicing.

320
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
Maybe there are genes with many,
many exons.  And depending on how

321
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
those exons get joined together,
through a process of alternative

322
00:29:16 --> 00:29:21
splicing, you could produce diverse
antibodies or T cell receptors.

323
00:29:21 --> 00:29:25
That could be true.  And we
actually think a lot of diversity in

324
00:29:25 --> 00:29:29
biology does come from alternative
splicing of complex genes,

325
00:29:29 --> 00:29:34
but that's not the answer here.
Instead, the answer has to do with a

326
00:29:34 --> 00:29:43
process known as DNA rearrangement.

327
00:29:43 --> 00:29:46
This is a process that was
discovered, in the context of the

328
00:29:46 --> 00:29:49
immune system,
by Susumu Tonegawa who was a

329
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
professor in the Cancer Center at
MIT.  And, actually,

330
00:29:53 --> 00:29:56
he won the Nobel Prize for that
discovery some years ago.

331
00:29:56 --> 00:30:00
We now know that the generation of
all of these different antibodies

332
00:30:00 --> 00:30:03
and all of these different T cells
is due to complex rearrangements of

333
00:30:03 --> 00:30:07
a very small number
of complex genes.

334
00:30:07 --> 00:30:11
And I want to go through that with
you now.  And it is a little

335
00:30:11 --> 00:30:16
complicated.  And so I warn you that
I'm going to show you slides which

336
00:30:16 --> 00:30:20
come directly out of your book.
And we'll walk through them.  But

337
00:30:20 --> 00:30:25
then I advise you to read your book
which I think does a good job

338
00:30:25 --> 00:30:30
explaining how this rearrangement
process takes place.

339
00:30:30 --> 00:30:34
And hopefully together that will
solidify the concepts for you.

340
00:30:34 --> 00:30:38
So, again, immunological diversity
means that each B cell produces

341
00:30:38 --> 00:30:43
particular antibodies,
as I've said.  And these are the

342
00:30:43 --> 00:30:47
product of uniquely rearranged heavy
chain genes and a uniquely

343
00:30:47 --> 00:30:51
rearranged light chain gene.
And, likewise, each T cell, each

344
00:30:51 --> 00:30:56
distinct T cell has a specific T
cell receptor on its surface which

345
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
is the product of a uniquely
rearranged T cell alpha genes and a

346
00:31:00 --> 00:31:05
uniquely rearranged
T cell beta gene.

347
00:31:05 --> 00:31:08
And you can kind of think about the
process that we're going to talk

348
00:31:08 --> 00:31:11
about like a roulette wheel that in
roulette, as you know,

349
00:31:11 --> 00:31:14
one wheel spins and a particular
object shows up and the next wheel

350
00:31:14 --> 00:31:17
spins and a different object shows
up or the same one,

351
00:31:17 --> 00:31:20
and likewise the third way.
And you end up with a unique

352
00:31:20 --> 00:31:23
combination of objects.
The same is true is here.

353
00:31:23 --> 00:31:27
And there are lots of different
combinations that can come up.

354
00:31:27 --> 00:31:30
Actually, last year when I was
talking about this,

355
00:31:30 --> 00:31:33
I realized that an even better
analogy is Mr.

356
00:31:33 --> 00:31:36
Potato Head.  And I thought to bring
this morning the Mr.

357
00:31:36 --> 00:31:39
Potato Head thing from my
three-year-old daughter,

358
00:31:39 --> 00:31:42
but she threw herself across the
door.  So I actually was unable to

359
00:31:42 --> 00:31:45
bring Mr. Potato Head with me,
but hopefully you remember Mr.

360
00:31:45 --> 00:31:48
Potato Head.  It's a bland head,
and you can put a different mouth or

361
00:31:48 --> 00:31:52
a different nose or a different pair
of eyes or hair.

362
00:31:52 --> 00:31:55
And based on the combination that
you choose you get a very different

363
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
looking face.  The same thing is
true in the generation of antibodies

364
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
and T cell receptors.
It's a choice at different positions,

365
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
and based on the choice that's made
you make a unique looking antibody

366
00:32:06 --> 00:32:11
or T cell receptor.
So this is illustrated here.

367
00:32:11 --> 00:32:16
What we're looking at is a piece of
DNA that constitutes the

368
00:32:16 --> 00:32:20
un-rearranged heavy chain gene of
antibodies.  And you can see that

369
00:32:20 --> 00:32:25
there are different regions colored
differently.  There's a region

370
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
called the V region which has
several segments,

371
00:32:30 --> 00:32:35
several bits, which are similar but
a little bit different.

372
00:32:35 --> 00:32:39
There might be a hundred or so of
these V segment exons clustered

373
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
together here.
Next door is another set of

374
00:32:43 --> 00:32:47
segments called the D segments,
and there are about 30 of those.

375
00:32:47 --> 00:32:51
And then next to them are the J
segments, and there are about six of

376
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
those.  Next door is another set of
segments called the constant region

377
00:32:55 --> 00:33:00
exons.  These actually get used in a
slightly different way.

378
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
They don't come together by DNA
rearrangement but rather by splicing,

379
00:33:04 --> 00:33:08
but this also adds to the diversity.
When this rearrangement process is

380
00:33:08 --> 00:33:12
done you can choose a different exon
down here by alternative splicing.

381
00:33:12 --> 00:33:17
So you can maybe get a sense, if
we're going to pick one of these and

382
00:33:17 --> 00:33:21
then randomly one of these and then
randomly one of these we can

383
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25
generate a lot of diversity.
This happens, as I said, through an

384
00:33:25 --> 00:33:30
ordered process of DNA
rearrangement.

385
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
Our goal is to take an immature B
cell, B cell precursor and then

386
00:33:34 --> 00:33:39
sequentially rearrange the heavy
chain gene and the light chain gene.

387
00:33:39 --> 00:33:44
And then finally, when that's all
done, that mature B cell is going to

388
00:33:44 --> 00:33:48
be sticking on its surface a
specific antibody molecule which

389
00:33:48 --> 00:33:53
will have this structure here.
And the region of the antigen

390
00:33:53 --> 00:33:58
binding site will be the unique
product of the coming together of

391
00:33:58 --> 00:34:03
those V segments, D segments
and J segments.

392
00:34:03 --> 00:34:07
So the first step that happens is,
with respect to the heavy chain gene,

393
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
rearrangements take place.
There are enzymes that get turned

394
00:34:11 --> 00:34:16
on in the immature B cell which
specifically recognizes sequences

395
00:34:16 --> 00:34:20
next door to these segments.
The first segments that recombine

396
00:34:20 --> 00:34:25
together involve the D region
and the J region.

397
00:34:25 --> 00:34:29
So randomly one of the D region
segments and one of the J region

398
00:34:29 --> 00:34:34
segments gets chosen,
and the enzyme comes along and clips

399
00:34:34 --> 00:34:39
the DNA right next door to that
segment and right upstream of that

400
00:34:39 --> 00:34:43
segment looping out the stuff in the
middle, getting rid of it and

401
00:34:43 --> 00:34:48
joining together that particular
pair of segments.

402
00:34:48 --> 00:34:53
So now you have a unique new piece
of DNA which joins one of the D

403
00:34:53 --> 00:34:58
segments with one of the J segments.
Next, one of the V segments is

404
00:34:58 --> 00:35:02
chosen which then gets clipped,
and this region up here also gets

405
00:35:02 --> 00:35:07
clipped such that the middle piece
gets taken away and the two pieces

406
00:35:07 --> 00:35:12
get joined together.
And the product of that is a new

407
00:35:12 --> 00:35:16
piece of DNA that has a unique V
region joined to a D region joined

408
00:35:16 --> 00:35:21
to a J region.
OK?  So there's a series of cut and

409
00:35:21 --> 00:35:26
paste reactions that produces a
unique combination of V,

410
00:35:26 --> 00:35:30
D and J.  Once that process is done
then an RNA is produced

411
00:35:30 --> 00:35:35
from that locus.
The RNA gets spliced,

412
00:35:35 --> 00:35:40
as I said, to allow the VDJ segment
to get joined to one of the constant

413
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
region segments.
That mRNA product then gets

414
00:35:44 --> 00:35:49
translated into the heavy chain.
Once you make the heavy chain you

415
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
more or less go ahead and do the
exact same thing with the light

416
00:35:54 --> 00:35:59
chain.  You do a VDJ recombination.
Join it up with a constant region.

417
00:35:59 --> 00:36:03
Now that cell is able to produce
both a heavy chain and a light chain

418
00:36:03 --> 00:36:08
which is unique.
Those come together to form a

419
00:36:08 --> 00:36:12
unique specific antibody molecule.
So, again, that's complicated stuff.

420
00:36:12 --> 00:36:16
I don't expect that those of you
who haven't heard it before will

421
00:36:16 --> 00:36:19
understand it from what I've just
said, but all of what I told you is

422
00:36:19 --> 00:36:23
in the book.  And there's an
animation, which is where this comes

423
00:36:23 --> 00:36:27
from.  So I advise you to read your
textbook.  OK?

424
00:36:27 --> 00:36:30
The important point is that
recombination of these individual

425
00:36:30 --> 00:36:34
segments, random joining together of
these distinct segments gives

426
00:36:34 --> 00:36:38
tremendous diversity.
It allows you to produce ten to the

427
00:36:38 --> 00:36:42
seventh different T cells,
sorry, B cells.  The exact same

428
00:36:42 --> 00:36:46
process happens in the rearrangement
of the alpha genes and the beta

429
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
genes in the T cell receptor.
So you get, again, tremendous

430
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
diversity in that way.
Now, I'm just going to mention this

431
00:36:54 --> 00:36:58
but I don't expect you to know it
for life.  Well,

432
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
you might know it for life but you
don't need to know it for a test.

433
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
There are still other mechanisms
that the body uses to add even more

434
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
diversity.  It turns out that this
process of joining is actually

435
00:37:10 --> 00:37:14
intentionally messy so that the
joints that occur between these

436
00:37:14 --> 00:37:19
segments are not all the same from
one cell to another.

437
00:37:19 --> 00:37:23
Even if the cells were to rearrange
the same two or three segments,

438
00:37:23 --> 00:37:27
they wouldn't necessarily produce
the exact same antigen binding site

439
00:37:27 --> 00:37:31
because the process is inherently
sloppy in order to even

440
00:37:31 --> 00:37:37
make more diversity.
OK?  But you don't really need to

441
00:37:37 --> 00:37:44
know about that specific aspect of
it.  OK.  So through this process of

442
00:37:44 --> 00:37:51
rearrangement,
through this process of

443
00:37:51 --> 00:37:58
rearrangement we are able to make,
in the case of B cells, lots and

444
00:37:58 --> 00:38:05
lots and lots of distinct unique B
cells that are circulating

445
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
throughout your body.
They're different from one another

446
00:38:11 --> 00:38:15
because they have on their surface,
initially in the case of B cells

447
00:38:15 --> 00:38:19
they have on their surface these
antibody molecules which are

448
00:38:19 --> 00:38:23
different from one another in these
regions.  So these antigen

449
00:38:23 --> 00:38:31
binding sites --

450
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35
-- are unique.
This one is different from this one.

451
00:38:35 --> 00:38:39
And I should have mentioned I
wanted to emphasize that because of

452
00:38:39 --> 00:38:43
this rearrangement process the DNA
of this cell is different from the

453
00:38:43 --> 00:38:47
DNA of that cell.
I point that out because we've

454
00:38:47 --> 00:38:51
emphasized in the past that the
genome that you get when you're

455
00:38:51 --> 00:38:55
first fertilized is stable and
exactly the same in

456
00:38:55 --> 00:38:59
all of your cells.
That's actually clearly not true in

457
00:38:59 --> 00:39:03
the case of B cells and T cells
because they purposely rearranged

458
00:39:03 --> 00:39:07
the genome in the production of
antibodies in T cell receptor genes.

459
00:39:07 --> 00:39:10
So the genome actually is a little
bit different,

460
00:39:10 --> 00:39:14
at least in the case of the lymphoid
cells.  So these cells then are

461
00:39:14 --> 00:39:18
produced and they're quietly
circulating in your blood.

462
00:39:18 --> 00:39:22
So how do you mount an immune
response?

463
00:39:22 --> 00:39:31
You're now infected by some pathogen.

464
00:39:31 --> 00:39:35
How do you build up the
concentrations of one of these

465
00:39:35 --> 00:39:39
particular B cells or T cells that
can recognize that pathogen?

466
00:39:39 --> 00:39:43
How do you mount an immune response?
Well, the way you do it through a

467
00:39:43 --> 00:39:48
process of clonal selection.
And, again, this comes right out of

468
00:39:48 --> 00:39:52
your book.  These cells which are
floating around in the blood and not

469
00:39:52 --> 00:39:56
doing very much in terms of making
more of themselves,

470
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
they're not proliferating,
can respond through the exposure to

471
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
the antigen.
So if floating around the blood

472
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
along with these cells is a
particular antigen,

473
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
and it's able to bind to that
antibody molecule which is sitting

474
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
on the surface,
that sends a signal to that cell

475
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
it's time to divide.
There's something in the

476
00:40:20 --> 00:40:24
environment that we like so that we
need to make more of ourselves in

477
00:40:24 --> 00:40:28
order to fight off whatever
that thing is.

478
00:40:28 --> 00:40:31
This induces a rapid and impressive
proliferation.

479
00:40:31 --> 00:40:35
So you go from one or a small
number of these cells to many,

480
00:40:35 --> 00:40:39
many of these cells, particularly
these cells.  These cells don't

481
00:40:39 --> 00:40:43
proliferate because they're not
binding to the antigen.

482
00:40:43 --> 00:40:47
These cells do proliferate.
They make many, many more of

483
00:40:47 --> 00:40:51
themselves, and when they get to a
certain point they differentiate.

484
00:40:51 --> 00:40:55
They begin to make the material
they need to secrete really well.

485
00:40:55 --> 00:40:59
They actually change their shape
dramatically.  They become very

486
00:40:59 --> 00:41:03
efficient secretory cells.
And so these B cells that have the

487
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
antibody on their surface then
become secretory cells,

488
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
these plasma cells.  And the plasma
cells then secrete the antibody into

489
00:41:11 --> 00:41:16
the bodily fluids allowing the
antibody to then go off and bind to

490
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
the antigen whether it is itself
circulating or it's on the surface

491
00:41:20 --> 00:41:25
of the pathogen like a virus or a
bacterium.  So this process of

492
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
clonal selection then allows for the
cells to build up and,

493
00:41:29 --> 00:41:34
in this case, to differentiate into
antibody-secreting cells.

494
00:41:34 --> 00:41:38
Now, these are the cells and the
antibodies that are going to fight

495
00:41:38 --> 00:41:42
the infection.
These are the cells that are

496
00:41:42 --> 00:41:46
building up right here producing,
in this case, the antibody.  The

497
00:41:46 --> 00:41:51
same exact thing happens with
respect to T cells which you'll

498
00:41:51 --> 00:41:55
learn about in detail next time.
However, after the infection is

499
00:41:55 --> 00:41:59
cleared most of those cells go away.
They're no longer being stimulated

500
00:41:59 --> 00:42:04
and they actually die off.
But importantly not all of them go

501
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
away.  Some of them are set aside as
these memory cells.

502
00:42:08 --> 00:42:12
And if these memory cells that just
kind of hang around in higher

503
00:42:12 --> 00:42:16
concentrations than they were at the
very beginning of this process but

504
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
it's still relatively low
concentrations,

505
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24
and it's the presence of those
memory cells that when you're

506
00:42:24 --> 00:42:28
infected again they kick into action
quickly.  They've already matured to

507
00:42:28 --> 00:42:33
a very great extent, as
you can see here.

508
00:42:33 --> 00:42:37
They're on the edge.
They're poised to make a lot of

509
00:42:37 --> 00:42:42
antibody or be an effective T cell.
They build up very quickly and they

510
00:42:42 --> 00:42:46
suppress the immune response,
they suppress the infection.  So

511
00:42:46 --> 00:42:51
this process of clonal expansion is
the early phase.

512
00:42:51 --> 00:42:55
The setting aside of the memory
cells is the late phase.

513
00:42:55 --> 00:43:00
And it allows us to effectively
respond in a second infection.

514
00:43:00 --> 00:43:04
And it's also the reason that you
can respond once vaccinated.

515
00:43:04 --> 00:43:08
Vaccination is the exact same
process except you're exposed to

516
00:43:08 --> 00:43:12
something that is not inherently
dangerous.  In the case of an active

517
00:43:12 --> 00:43:17
infection, you're infected with the
pathogen, the active pathogen,

518
00:43:17 --> 00:43:21
and it builds up and then you
respond to it.

519
00:43:21 --> 00:43:25
But there's this dangerous phase
where you might actually die.

520
00:43:25 --> 00:43:29
In the case of vaccination, you get
exposed to something that is like

521
00:43:29 --> 00:43:34
the antigen, like the pathogen,
but it's not otherwise dangerous.

522
00:43:34 --> 00:43:38
But, still, the same stuff happens.
You build up antibody producing

523
00:43:38 --> 00:43:43
cells.  You build up T cells.
They then get set aside in the

524
00:43:43 --> 00:43:47
process of immunological memory.
And when you're exposed to the real

525
00:43:47 --> 00:43:52
thing, if you're exposed to the real
thing later on,

526
00:43:52 --> 00:43:57
like James Phipps was exposed to
smallpox, you already have those

527
00:43:57 --> 00:44:02
cells set aside and you can respond
effectively to the agent.

528
00:44:02 --> 00:44:08
So I want to now just mention in
closing the various vaccine

529
00:44:08 --> 00:44:14
strategies that are used.
And they all rely on this same

530
00:44:14 --> 00:44:20
phenomenon of exposing you to a
related agent or antigen allowing

531
00:44:20 --> 00:44:26
you to make T cells or B cells and
then fight them effectively.

532
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
So the first one that I mentioned
is cowpox for smallpox and I used

533
00:44:32 --> 00:44:37
the term heterologous vaccine.
A heterologous vaccine is an

534
00:44:37 --> 00:44:42
organism which is very similar to
the organism that causes the disease

535
00:44:42 --> 00:44:48
cowpox virus versus smallpox virus.
And it's so similar that the

536
00:44:48 --> 00:44:53
antigens that it produces direct the
development of antibodies or T cells

537
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
that will also work against the
dangerous pathogen.

538
00:44:59 --> 00:45:02
That's a great one if you can have
it, but there aren't very many of

539
00:45:02 --> 00:45:06
them.  There are very few examples
of heterologous vaccines.

540
00:45:06 --> 00:45:10
It's just coincidence or luck that
it worked in the case of

541
00:45:10 --> 00:45:19
cowpox and smallpox.

542
00:45:19 --> 00:45:23
A more common one is the attenuated
vaccine.  In this case,

543
00:45:23 --> 00:45:28
you take the active agent like polio
virus and the Sabin polio vaccine is.

544
00:45:28 --> 00:45:32
You take that active agent and you
grow it in the laboratory for a long

545
00:45:32 --> 00:45:37
time under conditions
in which it changes.

546
00:45:37 --> 00:45:41
It adapts to the laboratory
conditions and it's no longer

547
00:45:41 --> 00:45:45
dangerous to a person.
If infected with this you will not

548
00:45:45 --> 00:45:49
get polio, but it's sufficiently
similar to the original virulent

549
00:45:49 --> 00:45:53
pathogen but it has the same
antigens so you mount a proper

550
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
immune response.
This is an effective strategy.

551
00:45:57 --> 00:46:01
It's used all the time.
It's a little bit dangerous because

552
00:46:01 --> 00:46:05
if the attenuation process isn't
good enough and there's still a

553
00:46:05 --> 00:46:08
little bit of active pathogen in
there it could cause disease.

554
00:46:08 --> 00:46:12
And this happens every once in a
while with attenuated vaccines.

555
00:46:12 --> 00:46:19
Another way is to just take the

556
00:46:19 --> 00:46:23
agent, whatever it is,
and kill it.  Mix it with a chemical

557
00:46:23 --> 00:46:26
that will crosslink its genome or
heat it up really high so its DNA

558
00:46:26 --> 00:46:30
will be destroyed.
That's an agent which cannot

559
00:46:30 --> 00:46:34
reproduce itself in your body.
Its genome has been destroyed,

560
00:46:34 --> 00:46:38
but it still has in it the antigens.
It still has on its surface the

561
00:46:38 --> 00:46:42
antigens.  Your body will still
recognize it, make antibodies and,

562
00:46:42 --> 00:46:46
therefore, if you were ever exposed
to the live thing you will be

563
00:46:46 --> 00:46:51
protected.  This is also very
effective.  This is the Salk polio

564
00:46:51 --> 00:46:55
vaccine.  But every once in a while
the killing process isn't perfectly

565
00:46:55 --> 00:46:59
effective.  And so there's a little
bit of live virus or whatever in

566
00:46:59 --> 00:47:08
there and people get disease.

567
00:47:08 --> 00:47:12
Another strategy is component
vaccines.  Nowadays,

568
00:47:12 --> 00:47:16
we can purify from the pathogen
virus or bacteria a piece of it.

569
00:47:16 --> 00:47:20
You can purify some protein from
the virus or from the bacterium and

570
00:47:20 --> 00:47:24
just use that as the antigen.
That's not dangerous because it

571
00:47:24 --> 00:47:28
cannot replicate on its own inside
you, but your body makes antibodies

572
00:47:28 --> 00:47:32
against it.  And,
therefore, you'll be protected at

573
00:47:32 --> 00:47:36
some later time against
the real thing.

574
00:47:36 --> 00:47:46
And, increasingly,

575
00:47:46 --> 00:47:52
we're using recombinant vaccines.
Using molecular biology, genetic

576
00:47:52 --> 00:47:58
engineering, we can actually build
new agents that carry the genes of

577
00:47:58 --> 00:48:03
dangerous pathogens.
And, actually,

578
00:48:03 --> 00:48:07
a commonly used one is vaccinia
itself.  So if you take vaccinia,

579
00:48:07 --> 00:48:11
the cowpox virus, take some of its
genes out and put in the genes of a

580
00:48:11 --> 00:48:16
dangerous virus like polio virus,
now that cowpox virus will get into

581
00:48:16 --> 00:48:20
you.  It will replicate a little bit
and it will start making those

582
00:48:20 --> 00:48:24
antigens.  Your body will recognize
that with antibodies and T cells.

583
00:48:24 --> 00:48:29
You'll clear up that infection
because it's not a dangerous agent.

584
00:48:29 --> 00:48:32
But you will have made antibodies
and T cells that can recognize those

585
00:48:32 --> 00:48:36
other antigens such that if you were
infected at a later time you would

586
00:48:36 --> 00:48:40
be protected.  So these are examples
of vaccines, again extremely

587
00:48:40 --> 00:48:44
effective.  They rely entirely on
immunological memory,

588
00:48:44 --> 00:48:47
the generation of immunological
diversity.  Now,

589
00:48:47 --> 00:48:51
importantly, and this is something
that you'll pay attention to next

590
00:48:51 --> 00:48:55
time, not all of these vaccines are
created equal when it comes to

591
00:48:55 --> 00:48:59
producing a B cell or
a T cell response.

592
00:48:59 --> 00:49:03
Some will produce both.
Some will only produce a B cell

593
00:49:03 --> 00:49:06
response.  And you'll see why that
is in Monday's lecture.
