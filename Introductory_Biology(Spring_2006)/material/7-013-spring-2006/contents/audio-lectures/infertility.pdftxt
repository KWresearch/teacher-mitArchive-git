Infertility and ART 
1/5 couples has low fertility 
many reasons for infertility

equally likely  = male or female deficit 

male fertility declining- environmental?


a. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART)
Try to overcome infertility. 

b. Often use in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donated sperm, eggs 

IVF entails hormonal stimulation so that many eggs mature in one month 
(“superovulation”) 

Normally, in humans, many oocytes begin to mature (complete meiosis 
and grow larger), but competition for FSH is involved in ensuring that only 
one egg matures each month. 

Superovulation requires injections of GnRH + FSH and then LH to

circumvent normal hormonal feedback loops.


Mature eggs are retrieved via minor surgery.

This, plus the discomfort of hormone injections explains why an egg donor

is paid about 10 times more than a sperm donor!


Egg + sperm mixed in tube or dish. Sperm are usually treated with a

solution that encourages capacitation.


A few days later, healthy looking early embryos (blastocysts) that have

undergone normal cell division are introduced into a recipient uterus.

The recipient has been hormonally treated so that the uterus is receptive

for the embryo, to encourage it to implant.  Progesterone is especially

important here.


c. In cases of severe male infertility non-motile or immature sperm 
(haploid) can be injected into an egg using Intracytoplasmic Sperm 
Injection  (ICSI). 

d. Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) addresses specific genetic 
traits. For example, a couple may want to ensure that an embryo is not 
carrying mutations in both copies of the gene involved in cystic fibrosis (a 
recessive condition).

For PGD, after IVF, a single cell (blastomere) is removed and used in a 
PCR reaction with the genomic DNA to examine the presence of specific 
mutations in one or more specific genes. This is tricky from a single 
nucleus! The remainder of the embryo is maintained in culture and after 
the PCR has been performed, the decision on whether to implant the 
embryo is made. 

e. In alternate procedures, most usually amniocentesis, sloughed off 
cells are collected from older embryos in utero (about 16 weeks after 
fertilization) using a needle inserted into the amniotic cavity. These cells 
are used in PCR diagnosis or in chromosome “spreads”. In the latter, 
chromosome-specific probes are used in a hybridization reaction, and the 
number of chromosomes or translocations can be examined. The decision 
can then be made whether to continue a pregnancy. 

More to say about ART when we discuss stem cells and cloning
