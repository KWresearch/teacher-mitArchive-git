1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
What I want to talk to you today
about is the creation of

2
00:00:20 --> 00:00:26
3-dimensional structures.
And I want to emphasize their

3
00:00:26 --> 00:00:32
connection to the function of the
organisms and the organ.

4
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
Let's look, for example,
at the kidney.  This is a fantastic

5
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
example of structure- function
relationships.

6
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
The kidney comprises thousand of
tubules that are involved in

7
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
filtering the blood and collecting
urine for excretion.

8
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
Now, not only do these tubules
function to transport the urine as

9
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
it is being processed,
they also are connected very closely

10
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
to various cell types that are
involved in this filtration

11
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
process.
So the 3-dimensional structure of

12
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
the kidney is integral,
is required for its normal function.

13
00:01:08 --> 00:01:12
And this is true in essentially
every organ.  So it's very important

14
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
to think about the relationship of
different cells to one another in a

15
00:01:16 --> 00:01:20
particular organ.
And if you're thinking about,

16
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
for example, using tissue
engineering to develop an artificial

17
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
kidney and making some kind of
pastiche of cells and polymers and

18
00:01:28 --> 00:01:33
putting that together in
some functional way --

19
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
-- it's important to understand
these structure-function

20
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
relationships in the normal organ
before you try to engineer something

21
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
that is a surrogate.
Individual cells also have

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
particular shapes,
and this is integral to their

23
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
function.  We'll talk a bunch about
neurons, cells that have very long

24
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
processes that transmit nervous
impulses or transmit electrical

25
00:01:55 --> 00:01:59
impulses and communicate
in that way.

26
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
The shape of the neuron,
the structure, the 3-dimensional

27
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
structure is absolutely required for
its function.  Tom,

28
00:02:07 --> 00:02:11
I think we could have a little more
light at the back there.

29
00:02:11 --> 00:02:15
It looks really dark if you guys
are trying to take notes.

30
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
Thank you.  OK.  We have,
you've seen this movie previously.

31
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23
OK.  This is the zebra fish.  The
zebra fish embryo.

32
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
Isn't it dark at the back?
Yeah.  Tom?  Oh, it takes a while.

33
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
It takes a while.  OK.
I want to show you this movie again

34
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
that you've seen a while.
You have it on your website.

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
And I want to show it to you now in
a different way.

36
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
We're actually going to first show
that during the early development of

37
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
the fish, these two cells on top
initially give rise to a ball of

38
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
cells sitting on top of this yoke
cell that is just a ball of cells.

39
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
And then suddenly these cells start
to move during the gastrula and then

40
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
the neurula phases of development.
And it's this cell movement that

41
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
builds structure.
And I want to try to address with

42
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
you how this cell movement occurs
and how it builds structure.

43
00:03:06 --> 00:03:11
So let's look at this movie again.
Here we go.  Cell division,

44
00:03:11 --> 00:03:16
building up the raw materials to
make the embryo.

45
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
A group of cells sitting on top of
the yolk.  And now watch here.

46
00:03:20 --> 00:03:25
It starts to move.  Those cells
have made the decision to move,

47
00:03:25 --> 00:03:30
and they going to move towards this
one dorsal side of the embryo.

48
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
And they are going to move and move
some more to build the eye,

49
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
the brain and the various somites
along the length of the axis.

50
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
OK.  So that process, the
generation of 3-dimensional

51
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
structure is a very large part of
the process of building the embryo.

52
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
And it's interdigitated with making
the cell types.

53
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
A muscle cell is not a muscle cell
and it's not functional unless it is

54
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
a fused myotube that has the
appropriate 3-dimensional

55
00:03:59 --> 00:04:05
structure.
So cell type and 3-dimensional

56
00:04:05 --> 00:04:11
structure are very closely related.
OK.  So let's talk about a toolkit

57
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
that is involved in this process.
And the first thing that we can

58
00:04:17 --> 00:04:23
discuss is what is in this toolkit.
Well, actually, you don't really

59
00:04:23 --> 00:04:30
have much in the toolkit
to build an organism.

60
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
I can think of one thing.
What's in your toolkit to build

61
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
your 3-dimensional organism?
Yes.  Did I hear cells?  Yeah.

62
00:04:40 --> 00:04:46
I hope I heard cells.  Well, there
are cells.  And then if you want to

63
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
look for something else to build the
organism with there are cells and

64
00:04:51 --> 00:04:57
then there are cells.
That's what you've got.

65
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
In your toolkit you've got cells.
And the challenge of the organism is

66
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
to use that singular building
material to build the various and

67
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
the huge array of structures that
there are.  So what

68
00:05:10 --> 00:05:20
about these cells?

69
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
And the first thing about these
cells is that they come in two forms.

70
00:05:25 --> 00:05:31
They come as so-called epithelia or
epithelial sheets.

71
00:05:31 --> 00:05:37
And they come as single cells which
are called mesenchyme.

72
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
And these two types of cells
interconvert with one another.

73
00:05:43 --> 00:05:50
And it's from these two groups of

74
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
cells, that can be different cell
types, but they're either sheets or

75
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
they're single cells,
that one builds the organism.

76
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
So the epithelia are sheets, the
mesenchyme are single cells.

77
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
And let me look at the next diagram
that I drew for you.

78
00:06:06 --> 00:06:11
And you have it in front of you.
If you don't have the handout, does

79
00:06:11 --> 00:06:16
anyone not have the handout?
Could I have, Lesley, could you

80
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] please?
Thanks a lot.  OK.  If you look at

81
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
the handout, you have this except
for one thing I added this morning.

82
00:06:25 --> 00:06:30
Here is a sheet of cells.  So I'm
going to do minimal board work today

83
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
because you have a lot of the
information right in front of you.

84
00:06:35 --> 00:06:40
You have a sheet of cells here.
And this sheet of cells called an

85
00:06:40 --> 00:06:45
epithelium is a sheet of cells
because it is joined together very

86
00:06:45 --> 00:06:50
tightly.  And the cells are joined
together by various junctions that

87
00:06:50 --> 00:06:56
I've shown here in yellow or that
I've shown in blue.

88
00:06:56 --> 00:07:01
And this sheet of cells,
as Professor Jacks told you,

89
00:07:01 --> 00:07:07
has two part, has two sides, an
apical side and a basal side.

90
00:07:07 --> 00:07:12
OK?  Remember from cell biology?
And it touches something called the

91
00:07:12 --> 00:07:17
basement membrane or the basement
lamina, which is part of the

92
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
extracellular matrix that I'll
mention again later.

93
00:07:22 --> 00:07:27
Now, this epithelium,
this sheet of cells can transform

94
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
into single cells.
And these single cells have the

95
00:07:32 --> 00:07:37
property of being non-adherent.
And they don't attach very tightly

96
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
to the extracellular matrix,
although they are in contact with it.

97
00:07:41 --> 00:07:46
And in order to go from an
epithelium to a mesenchymal state

98
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
there are changes in gene expression
that take place,

99
00:07:50 --> 00:07:55
we know, at the transcriptional
level.  And these result in changes

100
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
in cell adhesion and changes in the
organization of the cytoskeleton.

101
00:08:00 --> 00:08:05
This is a reversible process,
and mesenchyme can go and turn back

102
00:08:05 --> 00:08:10
into epithelium.
Now, the epithelial sheet is a very

103
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
important part of the body,
both as a building block for various

104
00:08:16 --> 00:08:21
structures, but also as a barrier.
So your skin is a barrier because

105
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
the cells in it are very tightly
joined together and they form an

106
00:08:27 --> 00:08:32
impermeable barrier.
But that's true of essentially every

107
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
organ you have.
Every organ you have is surrounded

108
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
by an epithelium,
or one or more epithelia,

109
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
and these surface barriers so that
stuff in the organ doesn't get out,

110
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
stuff outside the organ doesn't get
in.  And if there is a lesion,

111
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
a break in this epithelium it is a
big deal.  And that is wound.

112
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
That's what a wound is.  It's a
break in the epithelium.

113
00:08:56 --> 00:09:03
And there is a very rapid and
profound system of wound healing to

114
00:09:03 --> 00:09:11
repair these epithelial sheets.
Now, during development there are

115
00:09:11 --> 00:09:18
many transitions from epithelium to
mesenchyme.  So the term that you

116
00:09:18 --> 00:09:26
really need to know is abbreviated
EMT.  Not to be confused

117
00:09:26 --> 00:09:33
with other EMTs.
This refers to the epithelial

118
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
mesenchymal transition,
which I did not write on your

119
00:09:39 --> 00:09:47
handout so I will write it here.

120
00:09:47 --> 00:09:53
The epithelial mesenchymal
transition.  And it's always said

121
00:09:53 --> 00:10:00
that way, even if it's actually a
mesenchymal epithelial transition.

122
00:10:00 --> 00:10:04
One of the most profound examples of
epithelial mesenchymal transitions

123
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
is during the formation of the
nervous system.

124
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
Your central nervous system,
as we'll discuss in a few lectures,

125
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
forms from a tube that rolls up
during development.

126
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
And this tube is an epithelial
sheet.  As the tube is rolling up,

127
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
a group of cells, shown here in
yellow, moves away,

128
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
breaks away from the tube and
undergoes an epithelial to

129
00:10:28 --> 00:10:32
mesenchymal transition.
This group of cells is called the

130
00:10:32 --> 00:10:37
neural crest cell population,
and these neural crest cells then

131
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
migrate away from the neural tube
and go and set up the entire

132
00:10:41 --> 00:10:46
peripheral nervous system.
Not eripheral nerves, peripheral

133
00:10:46 --> 00:10:51
nerves.  They also make all the
pigment cells in the body and the

134
00:10:51 --> 00:10:56
adrenal medulla.
This epithelial mesenchymal

135
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
transition is not only crucial
during development.

136
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
It's also believed now to be crucial
for metastasis of tumors during

137
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
progression of cancer.
And Professor Jacks will address

138
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
that later in the course.
This is a movie demonstrating the

139
00:11:13 --> 00:11:18
migration of the neural crest cells
out from the neural tube which is in

140
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
the middle here,
this white tube.  And these little

141
00:11:22 --> 00:11:27
dots migrating out are shown over a
period of about 12 hours.

142
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
The single cells migrating out from
the neural tube as they have

143
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
undergone that epithelial
mesenchymal transition.

144
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
All right.  So I wasn't wrong in
facetiously saying what's in your

145
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
toolkit is cells.
That's what's in your toolkit.

146
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
But clearly the cells are slightly
different from one another or

147
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54
profoundly different from one
another in their disposition.

148
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
And we'll talk about what
mesenchyme and what epithelial can

149
00:11:58 --> 00:12:03
do in a moment.
The other thing that's different or

150
00:12:03 --> 00:12:09
the other thing that's important
that makes cells actually very good

151
00:12:09 --> 00:12:14
for building is that they are
plastic.  So let's go through a few

152
00:12:14 --> 00:12:20
things that they have going for them.
I want to talk about adhesion.

153
00:12:20 --> 00:12:25
I'm going to mention junctions,
I'm going to mention cell sorting,

154
00:12:25 --> 00:12:31
and I'm going to mention the
extracellular matrix.

155
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
And some of this stuff you've had
before so I'm going to go through it

156
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
quickly.  This is a diagram that's
on your handout,

157
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
it's from your book,
to indicate that there are many ways

158
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
epithelial sheets are stuck together
that involve very tight apposition

159
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
of the cell membranes,
or in the case of tight junctions or

160
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
slightly less tight apposition in
the case of these things called

161
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
desmosomes.  You can go back and
remind yourselves.

162
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
We mentioned these previously.
The most important thing is you

163
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
understand that cells
are joined together.

164
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
In this micrograph,
to demonstrate how tightly cells are

165
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
joined together,
this is a sheet of cells where the

166
00:13:09 --> 00:13:14
nuclei are stained green and the red
is staining for a particular

167
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
specific protein that is found in a
kind of junction called a tight

168
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
junction.  And these tight junctions
outline the cells.

169
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
In other words, the cells are glued
together very tightly.

170
00:13:27 --> 00:13:32
Here's another one.
Cell sorting.  There is another kind

171
00:13:32 --> 00:13:36
of cell adhesion interaction that's
very important for cell adhesion.

172
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
I've indicated here something
called cadherins.

173
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
Cadherins are interesting.
They're calcium-dependent adhesion

174
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
molecules.  And if you have sharp
eyes you'll see up here something

175
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
that's got a beta and then there's a
word here catenin.

176
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
Remember beta-catenin from
dorsal-ventral axis formation?

177
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
This is the same beta-catenin.
Not only is it a transcription

178
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
factor, it is also involved in cell
adhesion.  There's an interesting

179
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
complication of biology for you,
but I don't want to dwell on that.

180
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
Cadherins are essential for
sticking cells together.

181
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
These are pictures of frog embryos.
This is a normal embryo that's been

182
00:14:16 --> 00:14:21
cut open and the cells remain a
tight mass.  However,

183
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25
if you take an embryo and you inject
it with inhibitors of cadherin

184
00:14:25 --> 00:14:29
function the cells become completely
loose from one another and you can

185
00:14:29 --> 00:14:33
actually see the outlines of the
cells because they are no

186
00:14:33 --> 00:14:38
longer stuck together.
Now, this is fascinating and very

187
00:14:38 --> 00:14:43
important for the animal because it
turns out there are lots of

188
00:14:43 --> 00:14:49
different adhesion molecules.
And different cells types sort out

189
00:14:49 --> 00:14:54
according to the adhesion molecules
they are expressing on their cell

190
00:14:54 --> 00:14:59
surfaces.  So this is a rendition of
a fantastic old experiment that was

191
00:14:59 --> 00:15:05
done in the 1950s to demonstrate how
cells sort out.

192
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
What was done,
these are two frog embryos,

193
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
and a piece of the future skin or
epidermis was removed from one,

194
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
and then a piece of the future
neural plate, the nervous system was

195
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
removed from another.
And these had different colors so

196
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
you could tell which cells were
which.  Now, if you take those cells

197
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
and you put them in a medium that
does not contain calcium all the

198
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
cadherins and other adhesion
molecules cannot work.

199
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
And these cells fall into a pile of
single cells.  And you can take your

200
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
pipette and mix them up in your
little dish, and you get this salt

201
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
and pepper arrangement of the two
kinds of cells.

202
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
And then you can add a little bit
of calcium back to the medium,

203
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
and the cells will form this big
ball of cells.

204
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
And it's salt and pepper again.
The two neural plate cells and the

205
00:15:56 --> 00:16:01
epidermal cells are mixed up.
But if you go away and have dinner

206
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
or have a good night's sleep and
come back the next day and look at

207
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
your ball of cells,
you see that amazingly the cells

208
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
have sorted themselves out.
The epidermal cells have gone back

209
00:16:13 --> 00:16:17
together and the neural cells have
gone back together with one another.

210
00:16:17 --> 00:16:21
And you can do this with cells from
almost any organ.

211
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
You can mix cells from two organs
particularly when they're embryonic

212
00:16:25 --> 00:16:29
organs.  You can mix them together,
but also in the adults to some

213
00:16:29 --> 00:16:34
extent.
And these cells from different

214
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
organs will sort out.
And they sort out because of

215
00:16:38 --> 00:16:43
specific adhesive molecules that
they have.  And the term that one

216
00:16:43 --> 00:16:48
uses for this is homotypic binding
where cells will interact with one

217
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
another through membrane-bound
receptors.  Again,

218
00:16:52 --> 00:16:57
I'm assuming you remember this is a
lipid bilayer with a protein

219
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
sticking through.
Two receptors,

220
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
proteins sticking through the lipid
bilayer interacting with one another

221
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10
in calcium-dependent or independent
ways.  And there may be more than

222
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14
one receptor that mediates
cell-specific interactions.

223
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
But these interactions keep
different cells separate from one

224
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
another and facilitate development
and building structure.

225
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
OK.  Here's another one.
The extracellular matrix.

226
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
What is the extracellular matrix?
We mentioned this at the beginning

227
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
of the course.
Professor Jacks threw it at you in

228
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
cell biology.  The extracellular
matrix refers to the stuff on which

229
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
the cells sit,
so cells in your body are not

230
00:17:42 --> 00:17:47
sitting on nothing.
An epithelium is not just floating

231
00:17:47 --> 00:17:51
free or a tube is not floating free
in liquid.  It is actually

232
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
surrounded by a bunch of proteins
and carbohydrates that are secreted

233
00:17:55 --> 00:18:00
by other cells and form the
extracellular matrix.

234
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
Or, in the case of epithelia,
the basement membrane.  OK?  That's

235
00:18:04 --> 00:18:09
what the extracellular matrix is
called.  It's highly organized in

236
00:18:09 --> 00:18:14
the case of the epithelium.
And it consists of proteins and

237
00:18:14 --> 00:18:19
various things called proteoglycans
which are sugars bound to proteins.

238
00:18:19 --> 00:18:24
Now, one of the proteins in the
extracellular matrix is collagen.

239
00:18:24 --> 00:18:29
And collagen is the most abundant
protein in the Animal Kingdom.  OK?

240
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
It comprises a very high percentage
of your body mass.

241
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
And if collagen, if there are
mutations in collagen many things

242
00:18:37 --> 00:18:41
can go wrong.  For example,
there is a disorder called

243
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
osteogenesis imperfecta where your
bones don't form properly.

244
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
That's a mutation in one of the
collagen genes.

245
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
There are a lot of collagen genes,
and the protein mass of collagen is

246
00:18:53 --> 00:18:57
enormous.  Now,
the cells are sitting on the

247
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
extracellular matrix.
But there is also a fantastic,

248
00:19:01 --> 00:19:05
and then that's good, that's helpful
for the cells in a support sense.

249
00:19:05 --> 00:19:09
It gives them some support.  But
the extracellular matrix does a lot

250
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
more than that.
It actually communicates to the

251
00:19:12 --> 00:19:16
cells.  And it does so by means of
adapter proteins.

252
00:19:16 --> 00:19:20
You have this as a handout,
if you didn't realize.  This is one

253
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
of your handout diagrams.
OK?  These adaptor proteins have

254
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
the property of being transmembrane
or at least integral membrane

255
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
proteins that are attached
to the cells.

256
00:19:31 --> 00:19:35
But they also attach to proteins in
the extracellular matrix.

257
00:19:35 --> 00:19:40
And this allows them to sense what
the extracellular matrix contains

258
00:19:40 --> 00:19:45
and to transmit that information to
the cells.  Because the thing,

259
00:19:45 --> 00:19:50
of course, about living organisms
and the 3-dimensional structures in

260
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
them is that the process of both
building the structure and

261
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
maintaining the structure
is a dynamic one.

262
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
It's not equivalent to building
Building 10 or Stata.

263
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
It's not equivalent to putting
components together and getting a

264
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
structure.  You get the structure,
and the structure is maintained

265
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
because the structure senses how
it's doing, whether it's intact or

266
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
not.  If one of the walls in this
building fell down,

267
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
it would fall down until someone
repaired it.  If one of the tubes in

268
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
your body gets a hole in it,
your body will sense it and try to

269
00:20:28 --> 00:20:33
repair it.
That same thing is true when the

270
00:20:33 --> 00:20:38
epithelia, and I'll tell you in a
moment, when mesenchymal cells are

271
00:20:38 --> 00:20:43
actually doing their building
process, they are sensing what is

272
00:20:43 --> 00:20:48
around them.  And they do it through
these adapter proteins.

273
00:20:48 --> 00:20:53
The adaptor proteins are receptors,
by definition, they're binding to

274
00:20:53 --> 00:20:58
something in the ECM.
And a large number of them comprise

275
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
of class of proteins called
integrins, as an example of a name.

276
00:21:04 --> 00:21:10
All right.  So let's move on here
and let's mention --

277
00:21:10 --> 00:21:21
-- the cytoskeleton as being

278
00:21:21 --> 00:21:32
required for shape and movement.

279
00:21:32 --> 00:21:35
We've mentioned the cytoskeleton
before.  I'll talk about it more in

280
00:21:35 --> 00:21:39
a moment.  This is a diagram from
your book that you had before.

281
00:21:39 --> 00:21:42
The cell is not a floppy bag of
liquid.  It contains many filaments

282
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
that keep it rigid,
that allow it to have particular

283
00:21:46 --> 00:21:49
shapes and that allow it to change
its shape.  We're going to be

284
00:21:49 --> 00:21:53
talking most about microfilaments
which comprise polymers of actin,

285
00:21:53 --> 00:21:56
the protein actin.  There are also
intermediate filaments and

286
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
microtubules which we mentioned last
lecture when we talked about

287
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
the sperm flagellum.
This is a micrograph of tube stained,

288
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
of cells stained for the microtubule
network.  The nucleus is yellow.

289
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
Stained for one of the major
proteins in the microtubules,

290
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
which is tubulin.  And you can see
this very extensive meshwork

291
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
throughout these cells.
And the same is true for actin.

292
00:22:21 --> 00:22:25
The same is true for intermediate
filaments.  So cells are very well

293
00:22:25 --> 00:22:30
supported by these filaments.  OK.
And, finally, let me mention cell

294
00:22:30 --> 00:22:35
division and cell death as being
part of the toolkit that allows one

295
00:22:35 --> 00:22:39
to build structure.
And I'll show you one experiment

296
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
which involves the inhibition of
cell death in the embryo.

297
00:22:44 --> 00:22:49
This is a mouse, normal mouse
embryo, and this is a mouse embryo

298
00:22:49 --> 00:22:53
in which a protein was removed.
This protein is called caspase-9.

299
00:22:53 --> 00:22:58
And caspases are involved in
killing cells during development,

300
00:22:58 --> 00:23:03
as Professor Jacks mentioned to you.
In this mutant animal,

301
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
one of the things you should notice
is that the brain is hugely

302
00:23:07 --> 00:23:11
overgrown.  And this is an
indication of the amount of cell

303
00:23:11 --> 00:23:15
death that has to happen during
normal brain development.

304
00:23:15 --> 00:23:19
OK?  And the flip side I'm not
going to dwell on.

305
00:23:19 --> 00:23:23
You need to get not only the normal
amount of cell proliferation,

306
00:23:23 --> 00:23:27
but it needs to be in the right
place.  All right.

307
00:23:27 --> 00:23:31
So let's talk about the behavior of
cells and how this works together to

308
00:23:31 --> 00:23:36
give 3-dimensional structures.
And I want to talk very briefly

309
00:23:36 --> 00:23:40
about, actually,
not so briefly, about the behavior

310
00:23:40 --> 00:23:48
of single cells --

311
00:23:48 --> 00:23:53
-- and the property that is most
important to them,

312
00:23:53 --> 00:23:58
which is the ability to move.
So the point about an epithelial

313
00:23:58 --> 00:24:03
mesenchymal transition is that what
comes out of it are single cells.

314
00:24:03 --> 00:24:08
And this is important in metastasis
and in normal development.

315
00:24:08 --> 00:24:13
The difference between this
epithelium and these single cells is

316
00:24:13 --> 00:24:18
that the single cells are free to
move because they are not attached

317
00:24:18 --> 00:24:23
to a sheet.  And that is how cells
get from one place to another in the

318
00:24:23 --> 00:24:29
body.  OK?  So let's dwell on this
in more detail.

319
00:24:29 --> 00:24:33
So how do cells know where they're
going?  Well, this is a very

320
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
interesting question.
They know where they're going

321
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
because they're told to go somewhere.
So I told you the neural crest

322
00:24:41 --> 00:24:45
migrating out of the neural tube.
This is a group of cells from an

323
00:24:45 --> 00:24:49
organism called dictyostelium.
And these are single cells.

324
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
They've been fluorescently labeled.
And up here in the corner someone

325
00:24:53 --> 00:24:58
has put invisibly a drop of the
second messenger cyclic AMP.

326
00:24:58 --> 00:25:03
And you can see these cells that had
been milling around randomly start

327
00:25:03 --> 00:25:08
to realize this and move as a
consorted group towards the source

328
00:25:08 --> 00:25:13
of cyclic AMP.
OK?  And this is one of the ways a

329
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
dictyostelium organizes itself.
The cells chemotax, they follow a

330
00:25:18 --> 00:25:23
particular chemical stimulus.
How do they move?  How do cells

331
00:25:23 --> 00:25:28
move?
Well, they move because the

332
00:25:28 --> 00:25:32
reorganize their cytoskeleton,
particularly their actin

333
00:25:32 --> 00:25:36
cytoskeleton in a concerted way.
So I've drawn for you a kind of

334
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
animated cartoon.
You have the whole thing in front

335
00:25:40 --> 00:25:45
of you.  And I'll animate it and see
how it goes.  We start off here with

336
00:25:45 --> 00:25:49
our green cell.
This is a mesenchymal cell.

337
00:25:49 --> 00:25:53
And it is sitting on some kind of
extracellular matrix,

338
00:25:53 --> 00:25:57
which I've shown as kind of
organized, but actually it may not

339
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
be.  But that doesn't matter.
It is loosely attached to this

340
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06
extracellular matrix.
It's got these receptors sticking

341
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
out of its membrane that can sense
extracellular matrix,

342
00:26:11 --> 00:26:15
but only at the rear of the cell is
it actually attached by these red

343
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
triangles to the ECM.
OK?  That's what my red triangles

344
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
indicate.  Now,
the cell suddenly as it's sitting

345
00:26:24 --> 00:26:29
there or moving randomly along comes
across these black circles --

346
00:26:29 --> 00:26:34
-- which are some kind of molecule
that can interact with these

347
00:26:34 --> 00:26:40
receptors and tell it that it ought
to go in a particular direction.

348
00:26:40 --> 00:26:46
So how does it do this?  Well, the
first thing it does it to elicit

349
00:26:46 --> 00:26:52
this interaction with a substrate or
with these black molecules in the

350
00:26:52 --> 00:26:58
substrate.  This is a receptor
ligand interaction.

351
00:26:58 --> 00:27:02
It's exactly the same kind of
interaction that you talked about in

352
00:27:02 --> 00:27:07
cell biology, that we talked about
in the formation,

353
00:27:07 --> 00:27:11
earlier formation lectures,
cell receptor ligand interaction.

354
00:27:11 --> 00:27:16
And it does the same thing that
other receptor ligand interactions

355
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
do.  It activates some kind of
signal transduction process,

356
00:27:20 --> 00:27:25
but this signal transduction process
has the property of telling the

357
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
actin filaments in this local region
of the cell that they

358
00:27:29 --> 00:27:33
should polymerize.
OK?  So this is cell signaling in a

359
00:27:33 --> 00:27:37
very local region of the cell.
And I'll show you the movie in a

360
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
moment.  You'll see it's
extraordinary.

361
00:27:41 --> 00:27:45
So here are the actin filaments
forming in this region of the cell.

362
00:27:45 --> 00:27:49
And I've called this the front of
the cell. OK?  It's an arbitrary

363
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
term.  But the front of the cell is
arbitrary but it's going to refer to

364
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
the direction that the cell is
moving.  So there's actin

365
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
polymerization of the front.
And the cell also sends out some

366
00:28:01 --> 00:28:06
protrusions called filopodia or
lamellipodia.  And it sends out

367
00:28:06 --> 00:28:11
these protrusions to try to sense
where it should move next.

368
00:28:11 --> 00:28:16
Now, once it's done that, once it's
made these polymerized actin

369
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
filaments it contracts.
However, it doesn't go anywhere

370
00:28:21 --> 00:28:26
because it's still attached at the
rear.  So it's kind of like pushing

371
00:28:26 --> 00:28:32
down on your accelerator when your
hand break is still engaged.

372
00:28:32 --> 00:28:36
OK?  You don't really go very far.
So the next thing it has to do is

373
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40
to lose the adhesion at the rear.
I couldn't get this to work but it

374
00:28:40 --> 00:28:44
will work in a moment.
OK.  And it also depolymerizes the

375
00:28:44 --> 00:28:48
actin at the rear.
So there.  There we go.

376
00:28:48 --> 00:28:52
There's loss of the adhesion and
there's loss of the actin at the

377
00:28:52 --> 00:28:56
rear.  And now it's in a position,
it's disengaged the hand break and

378
00:28:56 --> 00:29:00
it can move forward, so
it goes forward.  OK.

379
00:29:00 --> 00:29:04
This is my cartoon.
This is the real thing.

380
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
This is a cell where actin has been
labeled fluorescently.

381
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
And I want you to watch two things.
It's on a repeat loop so we'll

382
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
watch it a number of times.
At the part of the cell that is

383
00:29:16 --> 00:29:20
sticking out, you should be able to
see these bright cables or these

384
00:29:20 --> 00:29:24
bright lines.  These are cables of
polymerized actin.

385
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
OK?  And the cell is sticking out
these protrusions and

386
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
polymerizing actin.
And it's moving down in this plane

387
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36
of the board, or the screen as it's
making these polymers.

388
00:29:36 --> 00:29:40
OK?  So this is the front of the
cell.  And then if you look at the

389
00:29:40 --> 00:29:44
back of the cell,
let's wait for the loop again to

390
00:29:44 --> 00:29:48
start, and you will see,
here's the back of the cell with

391
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
initially polymerized actin.
And if you watch individual lines

392
00:29:52 --> 00:29:56
you will see them go away as the
actin is depolymerized and the cell

393
00:29:56 --> 00:30:00
loses its adhesiveness
at the back.  OK?

394
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
So this process involves selective
adhesion, loss of adhesion mediated

395
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
by actin polymerization through the
cytoskeleton.  There's a signal

396
00:30:09 --> 00:30:14
transduction pathway involved.
It involves things called GTPases

397
00:30:14 --> 00:30:19
that you've talked about previously.
And it's really an extraordinary

398
00:30:19 --> 00:30:24
process.  All right.
But let's move on and let's talk

399
00:30:24 --> 00:30:32
about cell sheets.

400
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
So cell migration is crucial to get
from one place to another,

401
00:30:36 --> 00:30:40
but you cannot really build much
with single cells because they're

402
00:30:40 --> 00:30:44
single cells.  They don't really
give you any kind of integral

403
00:30:44 --> 00:30:48
structure, any kind of cohesive
structure.  And so you have to turn

404
00:30:48 --> 00:30:52
these single cells back into sheets
if you're going to use them then for

405
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
building.  So what do cell sheets do?
Ah, OK.  So let me go through a

406
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
couple of things that
cell sheets do.

407
00:31:00 --> 00:31:05
Cell sheets can get longer.
They can change the number of

408
00:31:05 --> 00:31:10
layers that they have.
They can change the number of

409
00:31:10 --> 00:31:15
length, the number of layers that
they have, and they can bend.

410
00:31:15 --> 00:31:20
Here are some cartoons that I drew
for you.  Here's a sheet of cells.

411
00:31:20 --> 00:31:25
And you can lengthen it in two ways.
You can stretch it out so that the

412
00:31:25 --> 00:31:30
surface area to volume
ratio changes.

413
00:31:30 --> 00:31:34
And you get a longer,
thinner sheet of cells.

414
00:31:34 --> 00:31:39
You can also take this initially
bilayered sheet of cells and fit the

415
00:31:39 --> 00:31:43
cells in between one another by a
process called intercalation,

416
00:31:43 --> 00:31:48
or the term that's usually used is
convergent extension.

417
00:31:48 --> 00:31:53
And that lengthens a sheet of cells.
And the reason that a small embryo

418
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
becomes longer is because of this
process of intercalation where the

419
00:31:57 --> 00:32:02
embryonic cells interdigitate with
one another and make the whole

420
00:32:02 --> 00:32:07
embryo stretch out.
You can also change the number of

421
00:32:07 --> 00:32:12
cell layers to get a more complex
tissue, a more complex structure.

422
00:32:12 --> 00:32:17
You can break two cell layers into
two individual layers.

423
00:32:17 --> 00:32:22
That's called delamination.
Or you can turn two cell layers

424
00:32:22 --> 00:32:27
into one cell layer by another
process of intercalation so that you

425
00:32:27 --> 00:32:32
get a single sheet from what was
initially a two cell thick sheet.

426
00:32:32 --> 00:32:36
Again, this is in front of you and I
don't want you to dwell on it.

427
00:32:36 --> 00:32:40
Let's talk about bending cell
sheets.  This is really interesting

428
00:32:40 --> 00:32:44
because one of the things that comes
out of bending cell sheets are tubes.

429
00:32:44 --> 00:32:49
Now, tubes are pervasive.
There is not an organ in your body

430
00:32:49 --> 00:32:53
that does not have some kind of
tubular structure.

431
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57
And if you think about it,
if I were to give you a pile of

432
00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
cells and say, here,
build me a tube.

433
00:33:02 --> 00:33:07
You could probably come up with
several ways that you build a tube.

434
00:33:07 --> 00:33:12
And, in fact, the organism has come
up with several ways.

435
00:33:12 --> 00:33:17
One of the ways is to roll an
epithelial sheet into a tube.

436
00:33:17 --> 00:33:22
So here is the sheet.  And you roll
it up to form a tube.

437
00:33:22 --> 00:33:27
This is how your neural tube is
made.  And also part of this is that

438
00:33:27 --> 00:33:33
the cells change shape as
they are rolling up.

439
00:33:33 --> 00:33:37
So if you have a sheet of cells that
is either cuboidal or columnar,

440
00:33:37 --> 00:33:42
to get that sheet of cells to bend
you have to make wedge-shaped cells

441
00:33:42 --> 00:33:47
out of them.  You have to give them
a constriction,

442
00:33:47 --> 00:33:51
a so-called apical constriction.
So you go from a sheet of columnar

443
00:33:51 --> 00:33:56
cells to a bench sheet of cells
because you have apically

444
00:33:56 --> 00:34:01
constricted those particular cells.
And you can do that through an actin

445
00:34:01 --> 00:34:05
process or through our old friend
beta-catenin here acting as a cell

446
00:34:05 --> 00:34:10
adhesion molecule.
All right.  So here's the process

447
00:34:10 --> 00:34:14
of rolling up the neural tube in
frogs.  It's rolling up by apical

448
00:34:14 --> 00:34:18
constriction and by the epithelial
sheets bending.

449
00:34:18 --> 00:34:23
OK?  You've seen this movie
previously, and it is on your

450
00:34:23 --> 00:34:27
website so you can look at it again.
Here's another way.  You can

451
00:34:27 --> 00:34:32
balloon out an epithelium.
You can imagine an epithelium,

452
00:34:32 --> 00:34:36
and you make a little, you blow it
and you get a little balloon.

453
00:34:36 --> 00:34:40
And then you blow it some more,
you pull it some more and you can

454
00:34:40 --> 00:34:44
turn an indentation or a very small
vesicle into a long tube.

455
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
OK?  And I'll show you.  This is
not the best diagram,

456
00:34:48 --> 00:34:52
I've got to work on this one,
but the idea is that you pull this.

457
00:34:52 --> 00:34:56
Dr. Gardel is agreeing with me,
I've got to work on

458
00:34:56 --> 00:35:00
this diagram.  OK.
But you pull out this sheet of cells

459
00:35:00 --> 00:35:04
into a long tube.
I'll talk more about this when we

460
00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
talk about lung formation in a
moment.  Here's another way.

461
00:35:08 --> 00:35:12
You can take your single
mesenchymal cells that have migrated

462
00:35:12 --> 00:35:16
to wherever they're going and you
can get them to condense into an

463
00:35:16 --> 00:35:20
epithelial sheet.
And this epithelial sheet can then

464
00:35:20 --> 00:35:24
form a tube.  This is exactly what
happens in formation of the blood

465
00:35:24 --> 00:35:29
vessels.  Your blood vessels have
got lots of layers of epithelia.

466
00:35:29 --> 00:35:33
The first one to form is the
endothelium.  It's the inner most

467
00:35:33 --> 00:35:38
layer of the blood vessel.
And it forms by condensation of

468
00:35:38 --> 00:35:43
mesenchymal cells into an epithelial
sheet.  OK.  Excellent.

469
00:35:43 --> 00:35:48
So I want to end by giving you a
specific example and talking about

470
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
the genes involved in a particular
aspect of 3-dimensional structure

471
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
generation.  And the example I've
chosen is formation of the lung and

472
00:35:57 --> 00:36:02
the tubules in the lung.
So your lungs are made up of

473
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
multiple tubules that have got
little sacks on the end of them,

474
00:36:06 --> 00:36:11
alveoli that are the places where
oxygen is exchanged between the air

475
00:36:11 --> 00:36:15
you breath in and between the blood
vessels that feed into or that

476
00:36:15 --> 00:36:20
surround all the cells of the lung.
Formation of the lung tubules is

477
00:36:20 --> 00:36:24
very interesting because
mathematically,

478
00:36:24 --> 00:36:29
if you look at it,
you can really define it by a

479
00:36:29 --> 00:36:33
Mandelbrot set where you have some
kind of reiterative

480
00:36:33 --> 00:36:38
branching process.
And if you look at the lung tubules

481
00:36:38 --> 00:36:42
and count them and look at the
number of branching,

482
00:36:42 --> 00:36:46
you can figure out that you have to
go through 20 branching events to

483
00:36:46 --> 00:36:51
get to the set of lung tubules that
is in an adult human lung.

484
00:36:51 --> 00:36:55
OK?  If you look at the structure,
the structures during the process

485
00:36:55 --> 00:37:00
start with the trachea and this
thing called the bronchial bud --

486
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
-- which divides into two to give
two primary bronchi.

487
00:37:04 --> 00:37:08
Then each of those divide more,
branch more and so on.  So these are

488
00:37:08 --> 00:37:12
multi-cellular,
these are epithelial sheets that are

489
00:37:12 --> 00:37:16
branching reiteratively during lung
formation.  Here's a movie of the

490
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
process.  You can get this to take
place in a Petri dish with the

491
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
appropriate signals added.
And so here is the lung tubule

492
00:37:24 --> 00:37:28
branching reiteratively over a
period of about a day or

493
00:37:28 --> 00:37:32
two in tissue culture.
OK?  So this is a 3-dimensional

494
00:37:32 --> 00:37:36
tissue engineering,
or at least you can get this aspect

495
00:37:36 --> 00:37:40
of 3-dimensional tissue structure to
form in tissue culture.

496
00:37:40 --> 00:37:44
All right.  So what genes control
this?  As you know,

497
00:37:44 --> 00:37:49
as I've told you over and over and
over, everything is controlled by

498
00:37:49 --> 00:37:53
genes and the interaction of genes.
And what do we know about lung

499
00:37:53 --> 00:37:57
formation?  Well,
we know most about lung formation

500
00:37:57 --> 00:38:02
from insects.
In insects the evolutionary relic or

501
00:38:02 --> 00:38:06
the evolutionary precursor or the
evolutionary equivalent is the

502
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
system of trachea.
These are a system of tubes that

503
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
branch out from the spiracles,
which are holes that lead to the

504
00:38:14 --> 00:38:18
outside.  And then tubes come off
these spiracles and branch in the

505
00:38:18 --> 00:38:22
insect and actually carry air
directly to the tissues.

506
00:38:22 --> 00:38:26
There's no circulatory system
equivalent as there

507
00:38:26 --> 00:38:31
is in our cells.
But the way these tubules branch and

508
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35
form is very equivalent to ourselves.
And we know that this involves a

509
00:38:35 --> 00:38:40
receptor signaling system that you
are familiar with,

510
00:38:40 --> 00:38:44
which is a receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling system.

511
00:38:44 --> 00:38:48
And the particular one I'll tell
you about is the fibroblast growth

512
00:38:48 --> 00:38:53
factor signaling system.
You remember that growth factors

513
00:38:53 --> 00:38:57
bind to receptors,
and these growth factors can be in

514
00:38:57 --> 00:39:02
the extracellular matrix.
They usually are.

515
00:39:02 --> 00:39:06
That's one of the places where
growth factors are.

516
00:39:06 --> 00:39:10
They bind to a receptor.
And then there is a cascade of

517
00:39:10 --> 00:39:14
signal transduction that,
in this case, involves kinases.

518
00:39:14 --> 00:39:18
And eventually the final kinase
moves to the nucleus where it does

519
00:39:18 --> 00:39:22
stuff to transcription factors and
you change the transcriptional

520
00:39:22 --> 00:39:26
activity of a cell and you get stuff
happening.  OK.

521
00:39:26 --> 00:39:30
So this is a diagram of what
happens in the fruit fly where we

522
00:39:30 --> 00:39:35
know most about the process.
The epithelium that's going to give

523
00:39:35 --> 00:39:40
rise to the trachea undergoes cell
division, and at the same time it

524
00:39:40 --> 00:39:45
balloons out to form this thing
called the primary tubule.

525
00:39:45 --> 00:39:50
You have this diagram in front of
you.  It forms the primary tubule.

526
00:39:50 --> 00:39:55
After a bit, this primary tubules
branches to give secondary tubules.

527
00:39:55 --> 00:40:00
And later on it branches again to
give these tertiary tubules.

528
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
There are a number of mutants in
drosophila that affect each of these

529
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
processes, the primary tubule
formation secondary or tertiary

530
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
tubule formation.
And these are members of the

531
00:40:12 --> 00:40:17
fibroblast growth factor signaling
system.  In the primary tubule the

532
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
FGF receptor is expressed,
and the cells receive FGF which

533
00:40:21 --> 00:40:25
tells them to divide and to divide
in a particular orientation to give

534
00:40:25 --> 00:40:30
you this primary tubule
as it grows out.

535
00:40:30 --> 00:40:34
OK?  And there's a ligand sitting
around in the extracellular matrix

536
00:40:34 --> 00:40:39
that tells the cells to do this.
Now, what's really cool is that at

537
00:40:39 --> 00:40:44
the point where the secondary tubule,
I'm going to take 20 seconds,

538
00:40:44 --> 00:40:49
so I'd appreciate it if you'd listen.
At the tip of the tubule an FGF

539
00:40:49 --> 00:40:53
inhibitor called Sprouty is made.
This inhibits cell division of

540
00:40:53 --> 00:40:58
these cells right at the tip,
but the cells on either side

541
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
continue to divide.
And so you get the branching,

542
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
the secondary branching taking place.
And I'm going to stop there.

543
00:41:07 --> 00:41:12
And those of you, don't forget,
come along to Stata this afternoon

544
00:41:12 --> 00:41:15
if you need a review.
