<p></p>
<p> </p> <p>What I want to talk to you today about is the creation of  3-dimensional structures. And I want to emphasize their connection to  the function of the organisms and the organ.</p> <p>Let's look, for example, at the kidney.</p> <p>This is a fantastic example of structure- function relationships. The  kidney comprises thousand of tubules that are involved in filtering the  blood and collecting urine for excretion. Now, not only do these  tubules function to transport the urine as it is being processed, they  also are connected very closely to various cell types that are involved  in this filtration process.</p> <p>So the 3-dimensional structure of the kidney is integral, is required for its normal function.</p> <p>And this is true in essentially every organ. So it's very important  to think about the relationship of different cells to one another in a  particular organ. And if you're thinking about, for example, using  tissue engineering to develop an artificial kidney and making some kind  of pastiche of cells and polymers and putting that together in some  functional way --</p> <p>-- it's important to understand these structure-function  relationships in the normal organ before you try to engineer something  that is a surrogate.</p> <p>Individual cells also have particular shapes, and this is integral to  their function. We'll talk a bunch about neurons, cells that have very  long processes that transmit nervous impulses or transmit electrical  impulses and communicate in that way.</p> <p>The shape of the neuron, the structure, the 3-dimensional structure  is absolutely required for its function. Tom, I think we could have a  little more light at the back there. It looks really dark if you guys  are trying to take notes.</p> <p>Thank you. OK. We have, you've seen this movie previously. OK. This  is the zebra fish. The zebra fish embryo. Isn't it dark at the back?  Yeah. Tom? Oh, it takes a while. It takes a while. OK.</p> <p>I want to show you this movie again that you've seen a while.</p> <p>You have it on your website. And I want to show it to you now in a  different way. We're actually going to first show that during the early  development of the fish, these two cells on top initially give rise to a  ball of cells sitting on top of this yoke cell that is just a ball of  cells.</p> <p>And then suddenly these cells start to move during the gastrula and  then the neurula phases of development. And it's this cell movement that  builds structure.</p> <p>And I want to try to address with you how this cell movement occurs and how it builds structure.</p> <p>So let's look at this movie again. Here we go. Cell division,  building up the raw materials to make the embryo. A group of cells  sitting on top of the yolk. And now watch here. It starts to move.</p> <p>Those cells have made the decision to move, and they going to move towards this one dorsal side of the embryo.</p> <p>And they are going to move and move some more to build the eye, the brain and the various somites along the length of the axis.</p> <p>OK. So that process, the generation of 3-dimensional structure is a  very large part of the process of building the embryo. And it's  interdigitated with making the cell types. A muscle cell is not a muscle  cell and it's not functional unless it is a fused myotube that has the  appropriate 3-dimensional structure.</p> <p>So cell type and 3-dimensional structure are very closely related.</p> <p>OK. So let's talk about a toolkit that is involved in this process.  And the first thing that we can discuss is what is in this toolkit.  Well, actually, you don't really have much in the toolkit to build an  organism.</p> <p>I can think of one thing.</p> <p>What's in your toolkit to build your 3-dimensional organism? Yes. Did  I hear cells? Yeah. I hope I heard cells. Well, there are cells. And  then if you want to look for something else to build the organism with  there are cells and then there are cells.</p> <p>That's what you've got. In your toolkit you've got cells.</p> <p>And the challenge of the organism is to use that singular building  material to build the various and the huge array of structures that  there are.</p> <p>So what about these cells?</p> <p>And the first thing about these cells is that they come in two forms.  They come as so-called epithelia or epithelial sheets. And they come as  single cells which are called mesenchyme.</p> <p>And these two types of cells interconvert with one another.</p> <p>And it's from these two groups of cells, that can be different cell  types, but they're either sheets or they're single cells, that one  builds the organism.</p> <p>So the epithelia are sheets, the mesenchyme are single cells.</p> <p>And let me look at the next diagram that I drew for you. And you have  it in front of you. If you don't have the handout, does anyone not have  the handout? Could I have, Lesley, could you [UNINTELLIGIBLE] please?  Thanks a lot.</p> <p>OK. If you look at the handout, you have this except for one thing I  added this morning. Here is a sheet of cells. So I'm going to do minimal  board work today because you have a lot of the information right in  front of you.</p> <p>You have a sheet of cells here.</p> <p>And this sheet of cells called an epithelium is a sheet of cells  because it is joined together very tightly. And the cells are joined  together by various junctions that I've shown here in yellow or that  I've shown in blue.</p> <p>And this sheet of cells, as Professor Jacks told you, has two part, has two sides, an apical side and a basal side.</p> <p>OK? Remember from cell biology? And it touches something called the  basement membrane or the basement lamina, which is part of the  extracellular matrix that I'll mention again later.</p> <p>Now, this epithelium, this sheet of cells can transform into single  cells. And these single cells have the property of being non-adherent.</p> <p>And they don't attach very tightly to the extracellular matrix, although they are in contact with it.</p> <p>And in order to go from an epithelium to a mesenchymal state there  are changes in gene expression that take place, we know, at the  transcriptional level. And these result in changes in cell adhesion and  changes in the organization of the cytoskeleton.</p> <p>This is a reversible process, and mesenchyme can go and turn back into epithelium.</p> <p>Now, the epithelial sheet is a very important part of the body, both  as a building block for various structures, but also as a barrier. So  your skin is a barrier because the cells in it are very tightly joined  together and they form an impermeable barrier.</p> <p>But that's true of essentially every organ you have.</p> <p>Every organ you have is surrounded by an epithelium, or one or more  epithelia, and these surface barriers so that stuff in the organ doesn't  get out, stuff outside the organ doesn't get in. And if there is a  lesion, a break in this epithelium it is a big deal.</p> <p>And that is wound. That's what a wound is. It's a break in the epithelium.</p> <p>And there is a very rapid and profound system of wound healing to  repair these epithelial sheets. Now, during development there are many  transitions from epithelium to mesenchyme.</p> <p>So the term that you really need to know is abbreviated EMT. Not to be confused with other EMTs.</p> <p>This refers to the epithelial mesenchymal transition, which I did not write on your handout so I will write it here.</p> <p>The epithelial mesenchymal transition.</p> <p>And it's always said that way, even if it's actually a mesenchymal epithelial transition.</p> <p>One of the most profound examples of epithelial mesenchymal transitions is during the formation of the nervous system.</p> <p>Your central nervous system, as we'll discuss in a few lectures,  forms from a tube that rolls up during development. And this tube is an  epithelial sheet. As the tube is rolling up, a group of cells, shown  here in yellow, moves away, breaks away from the tube and undergoes an  epithelial to mesenchymal transition.</p> <p>This group of cells is called the neural crest cell population, and  these neural crest cells then migrate away from the neural tube and go  and set up the entire peripheral nervous system.</p> <p>Not eripheral nerves, peripheral nerves. They also make all the  pigment cells in the body and the adrenal medulla. This epithelial  mesenchymal transition is not only crucial during development.</p> <p>It's also believed now to be crucial for metastasis of tumors during progression of cancer.</p> <p>And Professor Jacks will address that later in the course. This is a  movie demonstrating the migration of the neural crest cells out from the  neural tube which is in the middle here, this white tube.</p> <p>And these little dots migrating out are shown over a period of about 12 hours.</p> <p>The single cells migrating out from the neural tube as they have undergone that epithelial mesenchymal transition. All right.</p> <p>So I wasn't wrong in facetiously saying what's in your toolkit is  cells. That's what's in your toolkit. But clearly the cells are slightly  different from one another or profoundly different from one another in  their disposition.</p> <p>And we'll talk about what mesenchyme and what epithelial can do in a moment.</p> <p>The other thing that's different or the other thing that's important  that makes cells actually very good for building is that they are  plastic.</p> <p>So let's go through a few things that they have going for them. I  want to talk about adhesion. I'm going to mention junctions, I'm going  to mention cell sorting, and I'm going to mention the extracellular  matrix.</p> <p>And some of this stuff you've had before so I'm going to go through it quickly.</p> <p>This is a diagram that's on your handout, it's from your book, to  indicate that there are many ways epithelial sheets are stuck together  that involve very tight apposition of the cell membranes, or in the case  of tight junctions or slightly less tight apposition in the case of  these things called desmosomes.</p> <p>You can go back and remind yourselves. We mentioned these previously.  The most important thing is you understand that cells are joined  together.</p> <p>In this micrograph, to demonstrate how tightly cells are joined  together, this is a sheet of cells where the nuclei are stained green  and the red is staining for a particular specific protein that is found  in a kind of junction called a tight junction.</p> <p>And these tight junctions outline the cells. In other words, the cells are glued together very tightly. Here's another one.</p> <p>Cell sorting. There is another kind of cell adhesion interaction that's very important for cell adhesion.</p> <p>I've indicated here something called cadherins. Cadherins are  interesting. They're calcium-dependent adhesion molecules. And if you  have sharp eyes you'll see up here something that's got a beta and then  there's a word here catenin.</p> <p>Remember beta-catenin from dorsal-ventral axis formation? This is the same beta-catenin.</p> <p>Not only is it a transcription factor, it is also involved in cell  adhesion. There's an interesting complication of biology for you, but I  don't want to dwell on that.</p> <p>Cadherins are essential for sticking cells together. These are  pictures of frog embryos. This is a normal embryo that's been cut open  and the cells remain a tight mass. However, if you take an embryo and  you inject it with inhibitors of cadherin function the cells become  completely loose from one another and you can actually see the outlines  of the cells because they are no longer stuck together.</p> <p>Now, this is fascinating and very important for the animal because it turns out there are lots of different adhesion molecules.</p> <p>And different cells types sort out according to the adhesion  molecules they are expressing on their cell surfaces. So this is a  rendition of a fantastic old experiment that was done in the 1950s to  demonstrate how cells sort out.</p> <p>What was done, these are two frog embryos, and a piece of the future  skin or epidermis was removed from one, and then a piece of the future  neural plate, the nervous system was removed from another.</p> <p>And these had different colors so you could tell which cells were  which. Now, if you take those cells and you put them in a medium that  does not contain calcium all the cadherins and other adhesion molecules  cannot work.</p> <p>And these cells fall into a pile of single cells.</p> <p>And you can take your pipette and mix them up in your little dish,  and you get this salt and pepper arrangement of the two kinds of cells.  And then you can add a little bit of calcium back to the medium, and the  cells will form this big ball of cells.</p> <p>And it's salt and pepper again. The two neural plate cells and the epidermal cells are mixed up.</p> <p>But if you go away and have dinner or have a good night's sleep and  come back the next day and look at your ball of cells, you see that  amazingly the cells have sorted themselves out.</p> <p>The epidermal cells have gone back together and the neural cells have  gone back together with one another. And you can do this with cells  from almost any organ. You can mix cells from two organs particularly  when they're embryonic organs.</p> <p>You can mix them together, but also in the adults to some extent.</p> <p>And these cells from different organs will sort out. And they sort  out because of specific adhesive molecules that they have. And the term  that one uses for this is homotypic binding where cells will interact  with one another through membrane-bound receptors.</p> <p>Again, I'm assuming you remember this is a lipid bilayer with a protein sticking through.</p> <p>Two receptors, proteins sticking through the lipid bilayer  interacting with one another in calcium-dependent or independent ways.</p> <p>And there may be more than one receptor that mediates cell-specific  interactions. But these interactions keep different cells separate from  one another and facilitate development and building structure.</p> <p>OK. Here's another one. The extracellular matrix. What is the extracellular matrix?</p> <p>We mentioned this at the beginning of the course. Professor Jacks  threw it at you in cell biology. The extracellular matrix refers to the  stuff on which the cells sit, so cells in your body are not sitting on  nothing.</p> <p>An epithelium is not just floating free or a tube is not floating  free in liquid. It is actually surrounded by a bunch of proteins and  carbohydrates that are secreted by other cells and form the  extracellular matrix.</p> <p>Or, in the case of epithelia, the basement membrane.</p> <p>OK? That's what the extracellular matrix is called. It's highly  organized in the case of the epithelium. And it consists of proteins and  various things called proteoglycans which are sugars bound to proteins.</p> <p>Now, one of the proteins in the extracellular matrix is collagen. And  collagen is the most abundant protein in the Animal Kingdom. OK?</p> <p>It comprises a very high percentage of your body mass. And if  collagen, if there are mutations in collagen many things can go wrong.</p> <p>For example, there is a disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta where  your bones don't form properly. That's a mutation in one of the  collagen genes. There are a lot of collagen genes, and the protein mass  of collagen is enormous.</p> <p>Now, the cells are sitting on the extracellular matrix.</p> <p>But there is also a fantastic, and then that's good, that's helpful  for the cells in a support sense. It gives them some support. But the  extracellular matrix does a lot more than that.</p> <p>It actually communicates to the cells. And it does so by means of  adapter proteins. You have this as a handout, if you didn't realize.  This is one of your handout diagrams. OK? These adaptor proteins have  the property of being transmembrane or at least integral membrane  proteins that are attached to the cells.</p> <p>But they also attach to proteins in the extracellular matrix.</p> <p>And this allows them to sense what the extracellular matrix contains  and to transmit that information to the cells. Because the thing, of  course, about living organisms and the 3-dimensional structures in them  is that the process of both building the structure and maintaining the  structure is a dynamic one.</p> <p>It's not equivalent to building Building 10 or Stata.</p> <p>It's not equivalent to putting components together and getting a  structure. You get the structure, and the structure is maintained  because the structure senses how it's doing, whether it's intact or not.</p> <p>If one of the walls in this building fell down, it would fall down  until someone repaired it. If one of the tubes in your body gets a hole  in it, your body will sense it and try to repair it.</p> <p>That same thing is true when the epithelia, and I'll tell you in a  moment, when mesenchymal cells are actually doing their building  process, they are sensing what is around them.</p> <p>And they do it through these adapter proteins. The adaptor proteins  are receptors, by definition, they're binding to something in the ECM.  And a large number of them comprise of class of proteins called  integrins, as an example of a name.</p> <p>All right.</p> <p>So let's move on here and let's mention --</p> <p>-- the cytoskeleton as being required for shape and movement.</p> <p>We've mentioned the cytoskeleton before. I'll talk about it more in a  moment. This is a diagram from your book that you had before.</p> <p>The cell is not a floppy bag of liquid. It contains many filaments  that keep it rigid, that allow it to have particular shapes and that  allow it to change its shape. We're going to be talking most about  microfilaments which comprise polymers of actin, the protein actin.</p> <p>There are also intermediate filaments and microtubules which we mentioned last lecture when we talked about the sperm flagellum.</p> <p>This is a micrograph of tube stained, of cells stained for the microtubule network.</p> <p>The nucleus is yellow. Stained for one of the major proteins in the  microtubules, which is tubulin. And you can see this very extensive  meshwork throughout these cells. And the same is true for actin.</p> <p>The same is true for intermediate filaments. So cells are very well supported by these filaments. OK.</p> <p>And, finally, let me mention cell division and cell death as being part of the toolkit that allows one to build structure.</p> <p>And I'll show you one experiment which involves the inhibition of  cell death in the embryo. This is a mouse, normal mouse embryo, and this  is a mouse embryo in which a protein was removed. This protein is  called caspase-9.</p> <p>And caspases are involved in killing cells during development, as Professor Jacks mentioned to you.</p> <p>In this mutant animal, one of the things you should notice is that the brain is hugely overgrown.</p> <p>And this is an indication of the amount of cell death that has to  happen during normal brain development. OK? And the flip side I'm not  going to dwell on. You need to get not only the normal amount of cell  proliferation, but it needs to be in the right place.</p> <p>All right.</p> <p>So let's talk about the behavior of cells and how this works together  to give 3-dimensional structures. And I want to talk very briefly  about, actually, not so briefly, about the behavior of single cells --</p> <p>-- and the property that is most important to them, which is the ability to move.</p> <p>So the point about an epithelial mesenchymal transition is that what comes out of it are single cells.</p> <p>And this is important in metastasis and in normal development. The  difference between this epithelium and these single cells is that the  single cells are free to move because they are not attached to a sheet.</p> <p>And that is how cells get from one place to another in the body. OK? So let's dwell on this in more detail.</p> <p>So how do cells know where they're going? Well, this is a very  interesting question. They know where they're going because they're told  to go somewhere.</p> <p>So I told you the neural crest migrating out of the neural tube. This  is a group of cells from an organism called dictyostelium. And these  are single cells. They've been fluorescently labeled. And up here in the  corner someone has put invisibly a drop of the second messenger cyclic  AMP.</p> <p>And you can see these cells that had been milling around randomly  start to realize this and move as a consorted group towards the source  of cyclic AMP. OK? And this is one of the ways a dictyostelium organizes  itself.</p> <p>The cells chemotax, they follow a particular chemical stimulus. How do they move? How do cells move?</p> <p>Well, they move because the reorganize their cytoskeleton, particularly their actin cytoskeleton in a concerted way.</p> <p>So I've drawn for you a kind of animated cartoon. You have the whole  thing in front of you. And I'll animate it and see how it goes. We start  off here with our green cell. This is a mesenchymal cell.</p> <p>And it is sitting on some kind of extracellular matrix, which I've  shown as kind of organized, but actually it may not be. But that doesn't  matter.</p> <p>It is loosely attached to this extracellular matrix.</p> <p>It's got these receptors sticking out of its membrane that can sense  extracellular matrix, but only at the rear of the cell is it actually  attached by these red triangles to the ECM. OK? That's what my red  triangles indicate.</p> <p>Now, the cell suddenly as it's sitting there or moving randomly along comes across these black circles --</p> <p>-- which are some kind of molecule that can interact with these  receptors and tell it that it ought to go in a particular direction.</p> <p>So how does it do this? Well, the first thing it does it to elicit  this interaction with a substrate or with these black molecules in the  substrate. This is a receptor ligand interaction.</p> <p>It's exactly the same kind of interaction that you talked about in  cell biology, that we talked about in the formation, earlier formation  lectures, cell receptor ligand interaction.</p> <p>And it does the same thing that other receptor ligand interactions  do. It activates some kind of signal transduction process, but this  signal transduction process has the property of telling the actin  filaments in this local region of the cell that they should polymerize.</p> <p>OK? So this is cell signaling in a very local region of the cell.</p> <p>And I'll show you the movie in a moment. You'll see it's  extraordinary. So here are the actin filaments forming in this region of  the cell. And I've called this the front of the cell. OK? It's an  arbitrary term.</p> <p>But the front of the cell is arbitrary but it's going to refer to the  direction that the cell is moving. So there's actin polymerization of  the front.</p> <p>And the cell also sends out some protrusions called filopodia or lamellipodia.</p> <p>And it sends out these protrusions to try to sense where it should  move next. Now, once it's done that, once it's made these polymerized  actin filaments it contracts. However, it doesn't go anywhere because  it's still attached at the rear.</p> <p>So it's kind of like pushing down on your accelerator when your hand break is still engaged.</p> <p>OK? You don't really go very far. So the next thing it has to do is  to lose the adhesion at the rear. I couldn't get this to work but it  will work in a moment.</p> <p>OK. And it also depolymerizes the actin at the rear. So there. There  we go. There's loss of the adhesion and there's loss of the actin at the  rear. And now it's in a position, it's disengaged the hand break and it  can move forward, so it goes forward.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>This is my cartoon. This is the real thing. This is a cell where  actin has been labeled fluorescently. And I want you to watch two  things. It's on a repeat loop so we'll watch it a number of times.</p> <p>At the part of the cell that is sticking out, you should be able to  see these bright cables or these bright lines. These are cables of  polymerized actin. OK? And the cell is sticking out these protrusions  and polymerizing actin.</p> <p>And it's moving down in this plane of the board, or the screen as it's making these polymers.</p> <p>OK? So this is the front of the cell. And then if you look at the  back of the cell, let's wait for the loop again to start, and you will  see, here's the back of the cell with initially polymerized actin.</p> <p>And if you watch individual lines you will see them go away as the  actin is depolymerized and the cell loses its adhesiveness at the back.  OK?</p> <p>So this process involves selective adhesion, loss of adhesion mediated by actin polymerization through the cytoskeleton.</p> <p>There's a signal transduction pathway involved. It involves things  called GTPases that you've talked about previously. And it's really an  extraordinary process. All right. But let's move on and let's talk about  cell sheets.</p> <p>So cell migration is crucial to get from one place to another, but  you cannot really build much with single cells because they're single  cells.</p> <p>They don't really give you any kind of integral structure, any kind  of cohesive structure. And so you have to turn these single cells back  into sheets if you're going to use them then for building.</p> <p>So what do cell sheets do? Ah, OK. So let me go through a couple of things that cell sheets do.</p> <p>Cell sheets can get longer. They can change the number of layers that  they have. They can change the number of length, the number of layers  that they have, and they can bend.</p> <p>Here are some cartoons that I drew for you. Here's a sheet of cells.  And you can lengthen it in two ways. You can stretch it out so that the  surface area to volume ratio changes.</p> <p>And you get a longer, thinner sheet of cells.</p> <p>You can also take this initially bilayered sheet of cells and fit the  cells in between one another by a process called intercalation, or the  term that's usually used is convergent extension. And that lengthens a  sheet of cells.</p> <p>And the reason that a small embryo becomes longer is because of this  process of intercalation where the embryonic cells interdigitate with  one another and make the whole embryo stretch out.</p> <p>You can also change the number of cell layers to get a more complex tissue, a more complex structure.</p> <p>You can break two cell layers into two individual layers. That's  called delamination. Or you can turn two cell layers into one cell layer  by another process of intercalation so that you get a single sheet from  what was initially a two cell thick sheet.</p> <p>Again, this is in front of you and I don't want you to dwell on it.</p> <p>Let's talk about bending cell sheets. This is really interesting  because one of the things that comes out of bending cell sheets are  tubes. Now, tubes are pervasive. There is not an organ in your body that  does not have some kind of tubular structure.</p> <p>And if you think about it, if I were to give you a pile of cells and say, here, build me a tube.</p> <p>You could probably come up with several ways that you build a tube. And, in fact, the organism has come up with several ways.</p> <p>One of the ways is to roll an epithelial sheet into a tube. So here  is the sheet. And you roll it up to form a tube. This is how your neural  tube is made. And also part of this is that the cells change shape as  they are rolling up.</p> <p>So if you have a sheet of cells that is either cuboidal or columnar,  to get that sheet of cells to bend you have to make wedge-shaped cells  out of them.</p> <p>You have to give them a constriction, a so-called apical  constriction. So you go from a sheet of columnar cells to a bench sheet  of cells because you have apically constricted those particular cells.</p> <p>And you can do that through an actin process or through our old friend beta-catenin here acting as a cell adhesion molecule.</p> <p>All right. So here's the process of rolling up the neural tube in  frogs. It's rolling up by apical constriction and by the epithelial  sheets bending. OK? You've seen this movie previously, and it is on your  website so you can look at it again.</p> <p>Here's another way. You can balloon out an epithelium.</p> <p>You can imagine an epithelium, and you make a little, you blow it and  you get a little balloon. And then you blow it some more, you pull it  some more and you can turn an indentation or a very small vesicle into a  long tube.</p> <p>OK? And I'll show you. This is not the best diagram, I've got to work  on this one, but the idea is that you pull this. Dr. Gardel is agreeing  with me, I've got to work on this diagram. OK.</p> <p>But you pull out this sheet of cells into a long tube.</p> <p>I'll talk more about this when we talk about lung formation in a  moment. Here's another way. You can take your single mesenchymal cells  that have migrated to wherever they're going and you can get them to  condense into an epithelial sheet.</p> <p>And this epithelial sheet can then form a tube. This is exactly what  happens in formation of the blood vessels. Your blood vessels have got  lots of layers of epithelia.</p> <p>The first one to form is the endothelium.</p> <p>It's the inner most layer of the blood vessel. And it forms by  condensation of mesenchymal cells into an epithelial sheet. OK.  Excellent. So I want to end by giving you a specific example and talking  about the genes involved in a particular aspect of 3-dimensional  structure generation.</p> <p>And the example I've chosen is formation of the lung and the tubules in the lung.</p> <p>So your lungs are made up of multiple tubules that have got little  sacks on the end of them, alveoli that are the places where oxygen is  exchanged between the air you breath in and between the blood vessels  that feed into or that surround all the cells of the lung.</p> <p>Formation of the lung tubules is very interesting because  mathematically, if you look at it, you can really define it by a  Mandelbrot set where you have some kind of reiterative branching  process.</p> <p>And if you look at the lung tubules and count them and look at the  number of branching, you can figure out that you have to go through 20  branching events to get to the set of lung tubules that is in an adult  human lung.</p> <p>OK? If you look at the structure, the structures during the process  start with the trachea and this thing called the bronchial bud --</p> <p>-- which divides into two to give two primary bronchi. Then each of those divide more, branch more and so on.</p> <p>So these are multi-cellular, these are epithelial sheets that are  branching reiteratively during lung formation. Here's a movie of the  process. You can get this to take place in a Petri dish with the  appropriate signals added.</p> <p>And so here is the lung tubule branching reiteratively over a period of about a day or two in tissue culture.</p> <p>OK? So this is a 3-dimensional tissue engineering, or at least you  can get this aspect of 3-dimensional tissue structure to form in tissue  culture.</p> <p>All right. So what genes control this? As you know, as I've told you  over and over and over, everything is controlled by genes and the  interaction of genes. And what do we know about lung formation? Well, we  know most about lung formation from insects.</p> <p>In insects the evolutionary relic or the evolutionary precursor or the evolutionary equivalent is the system of trachea.</p> <p>These are a system of tubes that branch out from the spiracles, which  are holes that lead to the outside. And then tubes come off these  spiracles and branch in the insect and actually carry air directly to  the tissues.</p> <p>There's no circulatory system equivalent as there is in our cells.</p> <p>But the way these tubules branch and form is very equivalent to  ourselves. And we know that this involves a receptor signaling system  that you are familiar with, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase  signaling system.</p> <p>And the particular one I'll tell you about is the fibroblast growth  factor signaling system. You remember that growth factors bind to  receptors, and these growth factors can be in the extracellular matrix.</p> <p>They usually are. That's one of the places where growth factors are.  They bind to a receptor. And then there is a cascade of signal  transduction that, in this case, involves kinases. And eventually the  final kinase moves to the nucleus where it does stuff to transcription  factors and you change the transcriptional activity of a cell and you  get stuff happening.</p> <p>OK. So this is a diagram of what happens in the fruit fly where we know most about the process.</p> <p>The epithelium that's going to give rise to the trachea undergoes  cell division, and at the same time it balloons out to form this thing  called the primary tubule.</p> <p>You have this diagram in front of you. It forms the primary tubule.  After a bit, this primary tubules branches to give secondary tubules.  And later on it branches again to give these tertiary tubules.</p> <p>There are a number of mutants in drosophila that affect each of these  processes, the primary tubule formation secondary or tertiary tubule  formation.</p> <p>And these are members of the fibroblast growth factor signaling  system. In the primary tubule the FGF receptor is expressed, and the  cells receive FGF which tells them to divide and to divide in a  particular orientation to give you this primary tubule as it grows out.</p> <p>OK? And there's a ligand sitting around in the extracellular matrix that tells the cells to do this.</p> <p>Now, what's really cool is that at the point where the secondary  tubule, I'm going to take 20 seconds, so I'd appreciate it if you'd  listen. At the tip of the tubule an FGF inhibitor called Sprouty is  made.</p> <p>This inhibits cell division of these cells right at the tip, but the cells on either side continue to divide.</p> <p>And so you get the branching, the secondary branching taking place. And I'm going to stop there.</p> <p>And those of you, don't forget, come along to Stata this afternoon if you need a review.</p>
