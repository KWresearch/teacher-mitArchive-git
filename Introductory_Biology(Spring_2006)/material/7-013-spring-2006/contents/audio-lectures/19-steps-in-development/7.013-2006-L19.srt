1
00:00:12 --> 00:00:19
So today's lecture talks about the
cell cycle, the control of the cell

2
00:00:19 --> 00:00:27
cycle, and also cell death.
So obviously, cell division is

3
00:00:27 --> 00:00:34
extremely important in
multi-cellular organisms.

4
00:00:34 --> 00:00:42
We've talked a fair bit about
control of the cell cycle,

5
00:00:42 --> 00:00:50
in terms of mitosis and meiosis,
in earlier lectures.

6
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
Obviously, cell division is
necessary in a variety of

7
00:00:54 --> 00:00:59
circumstances,
probably the most obvious is

8
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
development.  You go from one cell
to ten to the thirteenth to ten to

9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
the fourteenth cells.
That's accomplished by a tremendous

10
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
amount of cell division that goes on
over your gestational period.

11
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
I've also pointed out, in fact we
talked about it last time,

12
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
that cell, that wound healing is,
in part, a process of cell division.

13
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
Fibroblasts for example,

14
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
and other epithelial cells,
get recruited to divide, in order to

15
00:01:31 --> 00:01:36
repair damage to a tissue.

16
00:01:36 --> 00:01:41
And even without damage,
there's a lot of cell turnover,

17
00:01:41 --> 00:01:46
for many tissues.  You may not
realize this, but your blood,

18
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
for example, turns over about every
month, so you have to replace all

19
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
your red blood cells,
and all your white blood cells,

20
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
and so on, periodically.
Cells in other tissues,

21
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
in the skin for example,
your skin cells are born,

22
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
they migrate up to the superficial
layers of your skin,

23
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
and then they get sloughed off,
and of course, they have to be

24
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
replaced.  There's a lot of cell
division that's going on naturally,

25
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
in the process of what we call
homeostasis, and to give you an

26
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
example of that,
if you consider your intestines in a

27
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
human, your intestines undergo ten
to the eleventh cell divisions per

28
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
day.  That's a remarkable number.
Ten to the eleventh cells dividing

29
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
in your intestines per day.
If you imagine that a cell in your

30
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
intestine is about ten microns in
diameter, if you lined up all the

31
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
cells next to each other that were
born in a given period of time,

32
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
in 38 days you would have enough
cells lined up end-to-end to go

33
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
around the earth,
and in a year you'd have enough

34
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
cells to make it from the earth to
the moon.  So you produce a

35
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
tremendous number of cells just
naturally, in the process of organ

36
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
function and homeostasis.
Of course we can have too much cell

37
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
division, and this is pathological
condition, which we typically

38
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
associate with cancer.
And indeed, many of the factors

39
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
that I'm going to talk to you about
today, that relate to the normal

40
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
control of cell division,
and also cell death, are perturbed

41
00:03:25 --> 00:03:31
in the development of cancer.
Cancer, as you almost certainly

42
00:03:31 --> 00:03:37
know, is a disease of too many cells,
and a major factor in that is

43
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
excessive cell division.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

44
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
So this happens to be a human
cancer cell line growing in tissue

45
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
culture, and one of the hallmark
features of cancer cells is that

46
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
they have, in a sense,
unlimited and unregulated cell

47
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
division.  So if you were to watch
this movie, which actually comes

48
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
from your book,
supplementary materials from your

49
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
book, you could watch these cells
dividing, and they would do so in an

50
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
unnatural fashion.
Without response to proper growth

51
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
factors that would stimulate cell
division, they would divide on top

52
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
of one another,
which normal cells don't do,

53
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
and other places and times when
other cells are kept in check,

54
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
cancer cells are not.  So the basic
process, which again is well

55
00:04:22 --> 00:04:27
familiar to you,
is to take a single cell and turn it

56
00:04:27 --> 00:04:36
into two.

57
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
And we discussed the very last
stages of this in earlier lectures

58
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
on mitosis, how the chromosomes get
divided from the mother to the two

59
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
daughter cells.
We also have briefly alluded to the

60
00:04:48 --> 00:04:52
fact that there's a second,
critical event, and you talked about

61
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
the mechanisms of DNA replication.
The DNA needs to get duplicated so

62
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
that it can be properly divided,
and this, as you know, occurs during

63
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
a particular phase of the cell cycle,
known as S-phase, for

64
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
synthesis phase.
And then there's chromosome

65
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
segregation, and this occurs in a
distinct phase of the cell cycle

66
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
called M-phase,
or mitosis phase.

67
00:05:19 --> 00:05:24
And the development of cells over
the course of,

68
00:05:24 --> 00:05:29
say development,
or in wound healing,

69
00:05:29 --> 00:05:35
can be thought of as a successive
iteration of DNA duplication,

70
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
DNA replication, and chromosome
segregation.  So in a sense,

71
00:05:40 --> 00:05:46
you go from mitosis to S-phase to
mitosis to S-phase.

72
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
These segments are separated by
periods of time when cells are

73
00:05:50 --> 00:05:55
accumulating the biomaterials that
they need, basically to function,

74
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
and also to carry out the next
phases of the cell cycle,

75
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
and these are refereed to as gap
phases, G1 for the one that

76
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
separates mitosis from S-phase,
and G2, the one that separates the

77
00:06:09 --> 00:06:14
S-phase from mitosis.
Now, this is a cyclic process,

78
00:06:14 --> 00:06:19
one cell gives rise to two, that
then undergoes this process again,

79
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
and so we think of these things as
cycles from M-to-S,

80
00:06:24 --> 00:06:29
connected by these gap phases,
G1 and G2.  Now there's another

81
00:06:29 --> 00:06:34
phase that we haven't told you about,
which many of your cells are

82
00:06:34 --> 00:06:40
actually in right now,
and that's a phase called G0.

83
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
This is a resting phase,
and this can be either permanent or

84
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
temporary.  Many of your cells,
when they're born, will stop

85
00:06:49 --> 00:06:54
dividing forever.
Cells in your brain,

86
00:06:54 --> 00:06:59
for example, or most cells in your
brain, cells of your cardiac muscle,

87
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
and there are many other examples.
Once they get born,

88
00:07:04 --> 00:07:09
they undergo mitosis,
they go into this resting phase,

89
00:07:09 --> 00:07:14
and they'll never come back out
again.

90
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
And that's why it's difficult,
for example, to deal with brain

91
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
injuries, or spinal cord injuries,
because those cells cannot be

92
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
recruited back into the cell cycle,
they can't make more of them.  But

93
00:07:24 --> 00:07:28
there are other cells in which the
resting phase is temporary,

94
00:07:28 --> 00:07:32
and these cells can then reenter the
cell cycle, going back from G0 to G1

95
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
and through the process again.
And a lot of the progenitor cells

96
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
that I referred to up there,
in terms of the skin and the blood,

97
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
and the intestines, are in that
situation.

98
00:07:43 --> 00:07:47
They're resting,
and then they be recruited back into

99
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
the cell cycle,
in order to make more derivative

100
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
cells.  It's also useful to consider
what the chromosomes are doing in

101
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
these different phases of the cell
cycle.  So in a G1 cell,

102
00:08:00 --> 00:08:05
if we think about a single
chromosome, and we're representing

103
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
it by a single-line,
although this is of course,

104
00:08:09 --> 00:08:14
a double-helix.  In the G1 phase
there's a single,

105
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
double-helical chromosome,
in S-phase that gets duplicated in

106
00:08:18 --> 00:08:23
the process of DNA replication,
initiation shown here, and it would

107
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
be completed so that the
single-chromosome would be

108
00:08:27 --> 00:08:34
ultimately duplicated into two.

109
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
And then in M-phase,
those two chromosomes get separated

110
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
from one another,
so these are now joined,

111
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
separated from one another,
eventually into two daughter cells,

112
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
which can then go through this
process again.

113
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
OK?  And much of what we think
about, when we think about how the

114
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
cell cycle is controlled is to deal
with the initiation of DNA

115
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
replication, and then the
initiation of mitosis.

116
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
OK, so this is a cyclical process,
a highly ordered process, this is a

117
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
representation of the cell cycle,
as shown in your book, just so you

118
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
know it's in there.
Exactly as I described to you,

119
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
mitosis and S-phase, where the
action is, these gap phases,

120
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
G1 and G2, and this little arrow
represents G0,

121
00:09:18 --> 00:09:22
and I've also used this term before,
interphase, that represents all the

122
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
phases where the DNA is not evident
under the light microscope.

123
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
It's only evident in mitosis
because of DNA condensation,

124
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
so the rest of the cycle, G1,
S, and G2, are called interphase.

125
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
So this is a highly ordered process,

126
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
each step preceded by a particular
other step, leading to a particular

127
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
outcome, events leading to a
particular outcome,

128
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
and in a topical sense,
you can think about it as the NCAA

129
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
pools, starting tomorrow there'll be
individual events,

130
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
games, which will lead to next
events in the next round,

131
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
and next events in the next round,
to an ultimate conclusion, in this

132
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
case, the NCAA champion,
which can only occur if the proper

133
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
events have happened,
prior to it.

134
00:10:06 --> 00:10:12
And you'll see another specific
example of how the order is assessed

135
00:10:12 --> 00:10:18
in the development of the stages of
the cell cycle.

136
00:10:18 --> 00:10:24
OK, so we know that the cell cycle
is important.  The question is,

137
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
how is it controlled?  How do you
accomplish this orderly process of

138
00:10:30 --> 00:10:36
cell cycle progression?
What are the genes --

139
00:10:36 --> 00:10:46
-- that regulate this process?

140
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
What do the genes encode, what do
the proteins, and what do the

141
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
proteins do?  What are the pathways
that they regulate to ensure the

142
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
stages of the cell cycle?
This was a huge question for

143
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
decades, and there was rather little
progress in trying to understand how

144
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
it happened, especially in us.
Our cells are sufficiently complex,

145
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
and there's relatively imprecise, or
particularly was in the past,

146
00:11:10 --> 00:11:14
imprecise methods for dissecting
complex processes in

147
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
mammalian cells.
And so it took experiments performed

148
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
in yeast, a single-cell,
eukaryotic organism, budding yeast

149
00:11:22 --> 00:11:27
and also fission yeast,
to allow us to understand what the

150
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
details of the cell cycle are.
Budding yeast, as shown here in a

151
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
picture from your book,
is a single-cell organism.

152
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
It's also haploid,
or it can be at least,

153
00:11:39 --> 00:11:43
haploid, which means that it has a
single set of chromosomes,

154
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
it doesn't have two sets, single set
of genes, which makes it amenable to

155
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
genetic analysis.
You can make mutants more easily,

156
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
if you only have one copy of each
gene to worry about.

157
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
So that's another reason that yeast
was attractive.

158
00:11:57 --> 00:12:01
And another reason,
which is kind of seen here,

159
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
not really obvious here, but when
yeast cells divide,

160
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
they go through a very
characteristic, morphological

161
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
change.
They start off as spheres,

162
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
like this one, and as they go
through the cell cycle,

163
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
they develop a small bud.
That bud then gets bigger,

164
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
and eventually the two, the joint
between the mother cell and the bud,

165
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
get severed to form two cells.  And
you can actually figure out where

166
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
you are in the cell cycle,
by examining exactly what the

167
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
morphology of the yeast cell is,
and I'll show you that on the next

168
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
slide.
This is the yeast cell cycle,

169
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
with overlay of the diagram of what
the cells look like in the different

170
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
phases, so a yeast cell that's in G0,
let's say, looks like this,

171
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
fairly round, nondescript, as it
enters G1 it creates a small bud,

172
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
that bud then gets bigger as the
cells are now duplicating their DNA,

173
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
the bud actually gets bigger.  It
gets bigger still,

174
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
during G2 phase, and then at M-phase
you can actually see a little

175
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
junction between the two cells,
and the mother and the daughter cell

176
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
are more-or-less the same size,
and then they separate from one

177
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
another, and they can go through the
cycle again.

178
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
And this is useful because you can
tell if you have a mutant,

179
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
as you'll see in a moment, if you
have a mutant in a gene that affects

180
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
one of these processes,
you can actually figure out where

181
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
the mutant gene acts within the cell
cycle, based on what the yeast cell

182
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
looks like.  And these individuals
here, won the Nobel prize for their

183
00:13:32 --> 00:13:36
efforts to understand the cell cycle,
they won it about five

184
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
years ago, or so.
This is Lee Hartwell,

185
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
he's an American, happens to run a
cancer center out at the University

186
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
of Washington,
very suave and sophisticated guy.

187
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
These two goofballs are Brits, very
nice guys actually,

188
00:13:49 --> 00:13:53
Paul Nurse, who's now the president
of Rockefeller University in New

189
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
York, and Tim Hunt,
actually Sir Tim Hunt,

190
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
because he's knighted after this
Nobel Prize.  And I'm going to

191
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
explain the experiments that all
three of these guys did today,

192
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
which won them the Nobel prize,
and gave us tremendous insight into

193
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
the control of the cell cycle in
yeast, which turned out to tell us

194
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
how the cell cycle is controlled,
also, in us.

195
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
OK, so the first thing we need to do
is to create mutants.

196
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
That's a general theme in biology.
If you want to understand a process,

197
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25
find a mutant that can't do it,
and understand the genes that get

198
00:14:25 --> 00:14:29
mutated in that process,
and so that's what happened in the

199
00:14:29 --> 00:14:33
hands of Lee Hartwell,
the guy in the upper-right,

200
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
he took this same yeast, the
budding yeast,

201
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
which is also Brewer's yeast,
the yeast that makes beer.

202
00:14:41 --> 00:14:46
He took a population of these yeast

203
00:14:46 --> 00:14:51
cells, and he mutagenized them.

204
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
I told you about this before,
you can add chemical mutagens that

205
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
soak into the cells,
bind to the DNA, cause mutations.

206
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
Each cell might have one, or a few
nucleotides changed,

207
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
and at some frequency those
mutations will affect genes,

208
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
and at some frequency the genes
affected will influence the process

209
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
that you're trying to study.
So he was trying to study growth

210
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
control, cell division,
so he asked about the ability of the

211
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
cells to grow,
and particularly,

212
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
he did so at two different
temperatures.  He tested the ability

213
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
of the cells to grow at their normal
temperature, which is about 25

214
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
degrees centigrade,
and he found that many of these

215
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
yeast cells would grow,
following mutagenesis, at 25 degrees.

216
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
Probably some of them wouldn't grow

217
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
because they would've inactivated
some critical gene,

218
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
and even at 25 degrees,
they couldn't grow.  However,

219
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
he then took these plates, and he
used a technique,

220
00:15:48 --> 00:15:53
which I referred to in a previous
lecture, called replica plating.

221
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
He took a stamp, basically, of
these colonies,

222
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
transferred them onto a fresh plate,
and examined how the cells grew at

223
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
30 degrees centigrade.
And what he found was that,

224
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
whereas many of the cells that were
able to grow at 25 degrees continued

225
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
to grow at 30 degrees,
so they produced colonies in exactly

226
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
the pattern that he had seen
previously.  Some of

227
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
the cells didn't.
This colony here,

228
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
while it was successful,
the cells were successful in growing

229
00:16:24 --> 00:16:29
at 25 degrees,
failed to grow at 30 degrees.

230
00:16:29 --> 00:16:33
And this type of mutant is referred
to as a temperature-sensitive

231
00:16:33 --> 00:16:48
mutant, --
[PAUSE}

232
00:16:48 --> 00:16:52
-- abbreviated TS.
We imagine that this mutation

233
00:16:52 --> 00:16:56
affects the amino acid sequence of
the protein, at low temperatures the

234
00:16:56 --> 00:17:00
protein is still able to function,
but at higher temperatures, maybe it

235
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
becomes a little unstable,
and now it can't function, and

236
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
that's why you see no growth here.
So we had a TS-mutant that affected

237
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
the growth of the cells, OK?
So my question to you is,

238
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
is that TS-mutant interesting?
Is it interesting?

239
00:17:15 --> 00:17:22
Well we can't actually know whether

240
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
it's interesting yet,
because there are two general

241
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
classes of mutations that would give
you this same phenotype.

242
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35
One of them is interesting,
does that cement always show,

243
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
or do we have a problem here?  It's
always there?  Never noticed it,

244
00:17:39 --> 00:17:43
in all these years.  You can
distinguish between these two

245
00:17:43 --> 00:17:48
classes of boring and interesting
mutants, based on the morphology of

246
00:17:48 --> 00:17:52
the yeast cells when you shift the
temperature.  If you start with a

247
00:17:52 --> 00:17:57
population of yeast cells growing
just randomly at 25 degrees

248
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
centigrade, including these mutants,
if you were to look under the

249
00:18:01 --> 00:18:05
microscope, you would find mutants,
cells that were at various stages of

250
00:18:05 --> 00:18:10
the cell cycle.  OK?
Now, let's imagine that our mutation

251
00:18:10 --> 00:18:14
affects a general enzyme that's
required for cell viability,

252
00:18:14 --> 00:18:18
DNA polymerase or maybe, better
still, some ribosomal protein that

253
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
all cells need all the time,
in order to function.  If I were to

254
00:18:22 --> 00:18:26
take these cells which were growing
at 25 degrees centigrade,

255
00:18:26 --> 00:18:30
and I were to shift them to 30
degrees centigrade,

256
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
and look under the microscope,
what would I see?

257
00:18:34 --> 00:18:41
Well, if it's a ribosomal protein,

258
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
and now translation just stops,
these cells are going nowhere.

259
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
Regardless of where they were in
the cell cycle,

260
00:18:49 --> 00:18:52
they don't go any further because
you need protein synthesis to do

261
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
anything, so if you look under the
microscope at these cells,

262
00:18:56 --> 00:19:00
following a temperature shift,
you would still find a distribution

263
00:19:00 --> 00:19:04
of cells in the different phases of
the cell cycle.

264
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08
Lee Hartwell was not interested in
this class of mutants.

265
00:19:08 --> 00:19:13
They could be anything,
he didn't care.  However,

266
00:19:13 --> 00:19:17
he reasoned that if he were dealing
with a mutant that affected

267
00:19:17 --> 00:19:22
specifically a stage in the cell
cycle, he might find that the cells,

268
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
upon temperature shift from 25
degrees to 30 degrees,

269
00:19:26 --> 00:19:31
got to a particular point in the
cell cycle and couldn't go any

270
00:19:31 --> 00:19:35
further, that this gene affected one
of these important transitions,

271
00:19:35 --> 00:19:40
and so for example --
-- if he were to look under the

272
00:19:40 --> 00:19:45
microscope, all of the cells would
have arrested with a small bud,

273
00:19:45 --> 00:19:50
would have arrested in G1, or maybe
they would've arrested looking like

274
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
this, just prior to mitosis,
or like this, somewhere in G2.

275
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
But importantly, they would arrest
with a specific morphology that

276
00:20:00 --> 00:20:05
would indicate that they had a
specific cell cycle block.

277
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
And so he did this, and he found
many, many such mutants.

278
00:20:10 --> 00:20:15
He called them cell division cycle
mutants, or CDC mutants.

279
00:20:15 --> 00:20:20
And it was his methodology,
which really broke this field open,

280
00:20:20 --> 00:20:26
and won him the Nobel prize.  Now
one example of a CDC mutant that he

281
00:20:26 --> 00:20:31
discovered, called CDC2,
was particularly important.

282
00:20:31 --> 00:20:37
It's been renamed CDK1, or
cyclin-dependent kinase one,

283
00:20:37 --> 00:20:44
for reasons that I'll come to.
Cyclin, sorry, cyclin-dependent,

284
00:20:44 --> 00:20:54
kinase one.

285
00:20:54 --> 00:21:00
And this one acts at a particular
phase in the cell cycle,

286
00:21:00 --> 00:21:07
early on in the transition from G1
to S.  So if you imagine cells in G0,

287
00:21:07 --> 00:21:13
going to G1, and then progressing
from G1 into S-phase,

288
00:21:13 --> 00:21:20
into G2, and finally, in mitosis.
This particular mutant blocked

289
00:21:20 --> 00:21:27
right here, and so it said that this
gene, CDC2 or CDK1,

290
00:21:27 --> 00:21:34
was required for this transition.

291
00:21:34 --> 00:21:38
And just to emphasize the
TS-temperature shift and building up

292
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
of the cells in the cell cycle
concept, imagine a cell that looked

293
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
like this, before the temperature
shift.  Ok?  If you now do the

294
00:21:46 --> 00:21:50
temperature shift,
this cell will progress to this

295
00:21:50 --> 00:21:54
point, but it won't go any further
because CDC2 is required.

296
00:21:54 --> 00:21:58
Maybe I'll draw this over here,
to make it even more obvious.

297
00:21:58 --> 00:22:01
CDC2 is required to go beyond this
point, so that cell will arrest

298
00:22:01 --> 00:22:05
right here.  If there were a cell
that looked like this,

299
00:22:05 --> 00:22:09
in the population of 25 degrees,
and now you shifted the temperature,

300
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
it would complete this phase because
CDC2 is not required.

301
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
It would make it all the way to here,
it would keep going,

302
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
and then it would get stuck here
again.  And that's why you get cells

303
00:22:19 --> 00:22:23
building up with a particular
morphology.  OK?

304
00:22:23 --> 00:22:26
So this was successful,
and as I said, he isolated a large

305
00:22:26 --> 00:22:29
number of such CDC mutants,
which have taught us not about just

306
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
that transition,
but many other transitions in the

307
00:22:33 --> 00:22:37
cell.
Now what Paul Nurse did,

308
00:22:37 --> 00:22:43
this guy here, he actually was
performing very similar experiments

309
00:22:43 --> 00:22:48
in a related yeast species,
but the critical experiment that he

310
00:22:48 --> 00:22:54
did was to clone the gene that is
responsible for CDC2 function.

311
00:22:54 --> 00:23:00
So he took CDC2 mutant cells, which
at 30 degrees --

312
00:23:00 --> 00:23:08
-- will not grow.

313
00:23:08 --> 00:23:14
And he added, through a cDNA
library, CDC2 cDNA,

314
00:23:14 --> 00:23:20
of yeast origin.  So he made a cDNA
library from yeast,

315
00:23:20 --> 00:23:26
he introduced it into these mutant
cells, and then he asked whether the

316
00:23:26 --> 00:23:32
cells could now grow
at 30 degrees --

317
00:23:32 --> 00:23:40
-- and the answer was yes.

318
00:23:40 --> 00:23:44
That is, if the cells now carried
an extra copy of CDC2,

319
00:23:44 --> 00:23:49
in the form of this cDNA,
they now could grow at 30 degrees.

320
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
He complemented the mutation
through the addition of a normal

321
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
copy of the CDC2 cDNA.
Quite surprisingly, he did the same

322
00:23:57 --> 00:24:05
experiment --

323
00:24:05 --> 00:24:09
-- using not a yeast gene,
but a human gene.  Frankly,

324
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
there was great skepticism in the
field about whether what these guys

325
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
were doing in yeast had anything to
do with cell cycle control in humans.

326
00:24:17 --> 00:24:21
Most people actually assumed that
it probably had nothing to do with

327
00:24:21 --> 00:24:25
it, and so therefore,
when Paul Nurse proposed to try to

328
00:24:25 --> 00:24:29
complement his yeast mutation with a
human gene, people

329
00:24:29 --> 00:24:36
were skeptical.

330
00:24:36 --> 00:24:40
But in fact, it worked.
And this told him, and the field,

331
00:24:40 --> 00:24:45
that the machinery that controls the
cell cycle in this simple,

332
00:24:45 --> 00:24:49
single-celled eukaryote, is highly
conserved, all the way through to

333
00:24:49 --> 00:24:54
humans, and that we could therefore
understand cell cycle control in us,

334
00:24:54 --> 00:24:59
by doing experiments like this in
yeast.  So this really broke the

335
00:24:59 --> 00:25:03
field open, and that's why Nurse won
the Nobel prize at that same time.

336
00:25:03 --> 00:25:08
However, there was a problem.
They did in fact clone the gene,

337
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
they were able to sequence the gene,
and they found that the sequence of

338
00:25:12 --> 00:25:17
the gene, which I'm going to refer
to now by the other name,

339
00:25:17 --> 00:25:22
CDK1, looked like a kinase.
It had amino acid sequence,

340
00:25:22 --> 00:25:26
which made it resemble known kinases,
so it was assumed to be a protein

341
00:25:26 --> 00:25:31
kinase.  However,
it didn't have any kinase activity.

342
00:25:31 --> 00:25:43


343
00:25:43 --> 00:25:46
If you mixed it with various
substrate molecules in the presence

344
00:25:46 --> 00:25:49
of ATP, those substrates were not
changed, they were not

345
00:25:49 --> 00:25:52
phosphorylated.
So the purified CDK enzyme had no

346
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
kinase activity,
and therefore, it wasn't entirely

347
00:25:56 --> 00:25:59
clear what its function really was,
and the field sort of got stuck

348
00:25:59 --> 00:26:02
there for a while,
trying to understand the biochemical

349
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06
function of CDK1,
and other cell cycle regulators.

350
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
And that then led to the experiments
done by Tim Hunt,

351
00:26:11 --> 00:26:17
this guy here.  And Tim Hunt,
actually doing experiments at Woods

352
00:26:17 --> 00:26:22
Hole, down at the Cape,
in a summer course, with summer

353
00:26:22 --> 00:26:28
students, did a famous experiment
using sea urchins.

354
00:26:28 --> 00:26:33
Sea urchins, when they're fertilized,

355
00:26:33 --> 00:26:37
undergo very rapid,
and very synchronous,

356
00:26:37 --> 00:26:42
cell divisions.  In the first few
hours after you fertilize sea urchin

357
00:26:42 --> 00:26:46
eggs, they will divide and divide
again.  And importantly,

358
00:26:46 --> 00:26:51
they will do so in a very
synchronous manner,

359
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
so all the cells will produce two
cells at around the same time,

360
00:26:55 --> 00:27:00
and those will all produce four
cells at around the same time.

361
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04
And this is important if one wants
to do biochemical experiments,

362
00:27:04 --> 00:27:09
to understand what is changing
within these cells as they're going

363
00:27:09 --> 00:27:14
through these various cell cycles.
And so, what Tim and his students

364
00:27:14 --> 00:27:18
did was to label the proteins in
these dividing sea urchin cells,

365
00:27:18 --> 00:27:23
with a radioactive amino acid, S35
methionine.  And then they simply

366
00:27:23 --> 00:27:28
made extracts of these cells at
different time points thereafter,

367
00:27:28 --> 00:27:32
and asked whether anything was
changing in an interesting pattern,

368
00:27:32 --> 00:27:37
at different times that correspond
to different stages

369
00:27:37 --> 00:27:43
of the cell cycle.
So they ran protein gels,

370
00:27:43 --> 00:27:50
they separated the proteins and then
exposed the gels to x-ray film,

371
00:27:50 --> 00:27:57
to visual what the protein
concentrations were at different

372
00:27:57 --> 00:28:03
time points.  They took cells at
time zero, they took cells after 30

373
00:28:03 --> 00:28:10
minutes, after 60 minutes,
after 90 minutes, 120 minutes,

374
00:28:10 --> 00:28:16
150 minutes, 180 minutes.
And they knew already,

375
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
from their earlier analysis,
that this corresponded to the first

376
00:28:21 --> 00:28:27
cell cycle, and this corresponded to
the second cell cycle.

377
00:28:27 --> 00:28:32
OK?  Now some proteins,
when they visualize them that way,

378
00:28:32 --> 00:28:37
didn't change.  At the different
time points they saw roughly equal

379
00:28:37 --> 00:28:43
concentrations of that protein
throughout, but interestingly,

380
00:28:43 --> 00:28:48
other proteins changed in abundance,
and did so according to a pattern.

381
00:28:48 --> 00:29:02


382
00:29:02 --> 00:29:07
They seemed to oscillate,
they seemed to cycle, in a pattern

383
00:29:07 --> 00:29:12
that corresponded with the cell
cycle.  And so he called these

384
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
cyclins, and he suggested that they
might have something to do with the

385
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22
control of the cell division cycle.
Well, meanwhile, Nurse and Hartwell

386
00:29:22 --> 00:29:27
were doing their thing on CDKs,
and so they came up with the idea

387
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32
that maybe these two things have
something to do with one another.

388
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
And particularly,
maybe the failure of CDK to function

389
00:29:37 --> 00:29:42
as a kinase was due to the fact that
it didn't have an accessory protein

390
00:29:42 --> 00:29:47
that it needed,
mainly the cyclin.

391
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
And so, whereas CDK2,
sorry, CDK1, was an inactive protein

392
00:29:53 --> 00:30:04
kinase.

393
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
Now in a test tube,
in a biochemical experiment,

394
00:30:09 --> 00:30:14
if they mixed CDK1 with one of these
cyclins, they observed kinase

395
00:30:14 --> 00:30:20
activity.  And thus the name,
cyclin-dependent kinase.  It's not a

396
00:30:20 --> 00:30:25
kinase, it's not an active kinase in
the absence of cyclin,

397
00:30:25 --> 00:30:31
it only becomes active in the
presence of cyclin.

398
00:30:31 --> 00:30:36
So let me give you two quick
examples of proteins that are then

399
00:30:36 --> 00:30:41
phosphorylated by this active kinase,
to give you a sense of how this

400
00:30:41 --> 00:30:47
kinase regulates cell cycle
transitions.  There's a class of

401
00:30:47 --> 00:30:52
proteins that are involved in the
regulation of replication initiation.

402
00:30:52 --> 00:30:58
We'll just call them replication
initiation factors.

403
00:30:58 --> 00:31:03
In the absence of phosphorylation,
they're inactive, and that's one of

404
00:31:03 --> 00:31:09
the reasons that replication is not
initiated at those times

405
00:31:09 --> 00:31:15
in the cell cycle.
However, in the presence of CDK

406
00:31:15 --> 00:31:22
cyclin, now the protein becomes
phosphorylated,

407
00:31:22 --> 00:31:29
and becomes active.
OK?  So one of the ways you trigger

408
00:31:29 --> 00:31:36
the transition from G1 into S-phase,
is to turn on this enzyme which

409
00:31:36 --> 00:31:43
phosphorylated this target protein,
and stimulates S-phase entry.

410
00:31:43 --> 00:31:51
A second example is a protein called

411
00:31:51 --> 00:31:56
pRB.  In its un-phosphorylated state,
it is active, different from here

412
00:31:56 --> 00:32:01
where, in its un-phosphorylated
state, it was inactive,

413
00:32:01 --> 00:32:06
and the function of the RB protein,
in its active state, is to block

414
00:32:06 --> 00:32:11
again, the transition from S-phase
to G1.  This is actually an

415
00:32:11 --> 00:32:16
important cancer gene,
it's mutated in a large number of

416
00:32:16 --> 00:32:21
cancers, and so we'll talk about its
function, exactly how it blocks the

417
00:32:21 --> 00:32:26
transition, in later lectures,
but suffice it to say, it does that.

418
00:32:26 --> 00:32:35
And when it is phosphorylated by CDK

419
00:32:35 --> 00:32:42
cyclins, it becomes inactive,
thereby allowing cells to progress

420
00:32:42 --> 00:32:50
from G1 into S-phase.
OK?  So those are two examples of

421
00:32:50 --> 00:33:16
how CDK cyclins operate.

422
00:33:16 --> 00:33:23
Now, importantly,
cyclin kinase activity is determined

423
00:33:23 --> 00:33:31
by the level of the cyclin.
As I told you, cyclin levels

424
00:33:31 --> 00:33:38
oscillate, where this is cycle one,
cycle two, cycle three.  So these

425
00:33:38 --> 00:33:46
are cyclin concentrations inside the
cell.  CDK levels do

426
00:33:46 --> 00:34:00
not oscillate.

427
00:34:00 --> 00:34:04
Concentration of the CDKs inside the
cells is rather constant.

428
00:34:04 --> 00:34:09
However, at this point in the cell
cycle, when there's not enough

429
00:34:09 --> 00:34:13
cyclin, you don't have kinase
activity.  Only when you go past the

430
00:34:13 --> 00:34:18
threshold, do you get
kinase activity.

431
00:34:18 --> 00:34:24
When it drops again,

432
00:34:24 --> 00:34:28
you lose kinase activity.
But in the next cell cycle,

433
00:34:28 --> 00:34:33
the cyclin levels increase again,
and you get kinase activity, and so

434
00:34:33 --> 00:34:38
on.  So the oscillation of cyclins
determines the oscillation of kinase

435
00:34:38 --> 00:34:42
activity, which determines the
periodicity of the cell cycle.

436
00:34:42 --> 00:34:47
Now, for the truth in advertising,
the situation is actually more

437
00:34:47 --> 00:34:52
complex, there are actually multiple
CDKs and multiple cyclins.

438
00:34:52 --> 00:35:02
So in our cells,
for example, if we imagine G1,

439
00:35:02 --> 00:35:13
S, M, G2, G1, S, M, G2, there's a
cyclin called cyclin-D,

440
00:35:13 --> 00:35:24
which comes up in G1, goes down,
comes up in the next G1, goes down.

441
00:35:24 --> 00:35:32
There's another cyclin called

442
00:35:32 --> 00:35:38
cyclin-E, which comes up a little
bit later, in S-phase goes down,

443
00:35:38 --> 00:35:43
stays down, comes up in the next
S-phase.  And there's finally

444
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
another one called cyclin-B,
which comes up in G2, and comes down,

445
00:35:49 --> 00:36:14
goes up in the next G2.

446
00:36:14 --> 00:36:20
Anyway, the point is that there are
different cyclins that get induced

447
00:36:20 --> 00:36:27
in different phases of the cell
cycle, and actually control,

448
00:36:27 --> 00:36:33
through binding to different CDKs,
different transitions in the

449
00:36:33 --> 00:36:40
different phases of the cell cycle.
OK.  Let's see.

450
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
So, another concept: the transitions
from the cell cycle don't occur,

451
00:36:44 --> 00:36:49
from one cell cycle position to the
next don't occur,

452
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
unless the previous cell cycle event
has been completed.

453
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
And that makes sense because you
don't want to,

454
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
for example, try to divide your DNA
in mitosis if you haven't fully

455
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
replicated your DNA in S-phase.
So there are processes that are

456
00:37:07 --> 00:37:12
overlaid on top of cell cycle
control, which ensure the completion

457
00:37:12 --> 00:37:17
of one phase before the next phase
is initiated.  And I draw,

458
00:37:17 --> 00:37:22
as an analogy, your washing machine,
which likewise, has checkpoints

459
00:37:22 --> 00:37:27
which will determine whether or not
the previous phase of the wash cycle

460
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33
has been completed.
For example, you don't spin your

461
00:37:33 --> 00:37:39
wash until all the water has been
rinsed out.  There's a sensor that

462
00:37:39 --> 00:37:45
will determine whether that's not
true, and if that sensor is tripped,

463
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
it blocks the wash cycle at that
point.  Your cells have very similar

464
00:37:51 --> 00:37:57
checkpoints that will monitor and
regulate cell cycle transitions,

465
00:37:57 --> 00:38:08
and they're called checkpoints.

466
00:38:08 --> 00:38:12
There are checkpoints,
actually, that operate at different

467
00:38:12 --> 00:38:16
phases of the cell cycle.
I'll only give you one example,

468
00:38:16 --> 00:38:20
it's actually the one that's best
known.  It occurs at the transition

469
00:38:20 --> 00:38:30
in mitosis, from metaphase --

470
00:38:30 --> 00:38:36
-- where, if you'll recall,
the duplicated chromosomes line up

471
00:38:36 --> 00:38:42
on the metaphase plate.
In the process of anaphase,

472
00:38:42 --> 00:38:48
where the chromosomes separate from
one another, the chromatids I should

473
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
say, separate from one another.
There's a cell cycle checkpoint

474
00:38:54 --> 00:39:00
that makes sure that this happens
before that can happen.

475
00:39:00 --> 00:39:04
And in particular,
if you have a chromosome which is

476
00:39:04 --> 00:39:08
only attached to one side of the
mitotic spindle,

477
00:39:08 --> 00:39:12
so if you recall,
these are centered in the middle

478
00:39:12 --> 00:39:16
through attachment to microtubules
that are emanating from the two

479
00:39:16 --> 00:39:20
poles.  If you have a chromosome
that is only attached to one of the

480
00:39:20 --> 00:39:24
two spindles, it's called monopolar
attachment, whereas perhaps other

481
00:39:24 --> 00:39:28
chromosomes, maybe all of the other
chromosomes, are properly attached

482
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
at the metaphase plate.
This one, unattached chromosome will

483
00:39:32 --> 00:39:37
literally send a signal,
a biochemical signal, which is the

484
00:39:37 --> 00:39:42
equivalent of "wait for me".
And that signal will inhibit cell

485
00:39:42 --> 00:39:47
cycle progression.
It'll specifically inhibit the

486
00:39:47 --> 00:39:52
transition from metaphase to
anaphase.  While that signal is

487
00:39:52 --> 00:39:57
being sent, the cells will just sit
there, waiting for another

488
00:39:57 --> 00:40:02
microtubule to bind to this end of
the chromosome,

489
00:40:02 --> 00:40:07
thereby extinguishing the signal,
relieving this inhibition, and

490
00:40:07 --> 00:40:12
allowing anaphase to progress.
OK, so these checkpoints are

491
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
critical in insuring that these
things happen in a timely and

492
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
ordered fashion.
OK.  That's it for the cell cycle,

493
00:40:20 --> 00:40:24
so for the final ten minutes, and I
always give short shrift to the next

494
00:40:24 --> 00:40:29
topic, which is cell death,
which is another fascinating topic,

495
00:40:29 --> 00:40:33
fortunately there's not a lot of
board work to show you.

496
00:40:33 --> 00:40:37
Cell death.  So cells are born,
divide, as we've just been talking

497
00:40:37 --> 00:40:42
about, but remarkable numbers of
cells in your body die.

498
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
They will die,
too, because of cellular injury,

499
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
but they'll also die because they're
programmed to die,

500
00:40:50 --> 00:40:54
or they'll decide to commit suicide,
or they'll be murdered by other

501
00:40:54 --> 00:40:59
cells.  This happens in development,
for example, your brains, as

502
00:40:59 --> 00:41:03
developing fetuses,
have ten times the number of cells

503
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
than you end up with as a young
infant, because 90%,

504
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
for some of you more than 90% of the
cells will actually be killed

505
00:41:11 --> 00:41:16
through this process of programmed
cell death.

506
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
Other cells, in your immune system,
for example, are eliminated by this

507
00:41:20 --> 00:41:25
process, so as to avoid them
attacking your own body.

508
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
And there's many other examples of
relevant and important programmed

509
00:41:29 --> 00:41:34
cell death.  So we want to
understand this process,

510
00:41:34 --> 00:41:39
partly because it's critical in
normal development,

511
00:41:39 --> 00:41:43
and also because deregulation of
this process is critical

512
00:41:43 --> 00:41:48
for many diseases.
Too little cell death can give you

513
00:41:48 --> 00:41:53
proliferate diseases like cancer or
autoimmune disease,

514
00:41:53 --> 00:41:58
too much cell death can give you
diseases like neurodegenerative

515
00:41:58 --> 00:42:04
diseases, too many cells in your
brain dying.  So the regulation of

516
00:42:04 --> 00:42:09
cell death is quite important.
Here are two other famous examples

517
00:42:09 --> 00:42:14
of programmed cell death.
This is the loss of the tadpole's

518
00:42:14 --> 00:42:18
tail that occurs through an orderly,
cellular suicide program, in which

519
00:42:18 --> 00:42:23
all of these cells die,
giving rise to a frog with no tail.

520
00:42:23 --> 00:42:27
And likewise, in development, your
hands are formed in such a way that

521
00:42:27 --> 00:42:32
the digits are actually connected by
other cells, but through this

522
00:42:32 --> 00:42:37
process of programmed cell death,
the cells in the middle, the

523
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
interdigital cells,
are eliminated, thereby sculpting

524
00:42:41 --> 00:42:46
the formation of your fingers.
And this can be regulated,

525
00:42:46 --> 00:42:50
and has been regulated, in evolution,
in some species,

526
00:42:50 --> 00:42:54
like ducks, the loss of the
interdigital cells doesn't take

527
00:42:54 --> 00:42:59
place, so they have webbing.
In other species of birds, like in

528
00:42:59 --> 00:43:03
us, the interdigital cells are
removed, so they have sculpted toes.

529
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
This is what programmed cell death
looks like.  It is a very rapid,

530
00:43:07 --> 00:43:12
and as I said, a very orderly
process.

531
00:43:12 --> 00:43:15
Cells get signals to die,
they can get signals because they

532
00:43:15 --> 00:43:19
get damaged, or they can get signals
from their neighbors.

533
00:43:19 --> 00:43:23
When they get those signals,
they undergo a series of biochemical

534
00:43:23 --> 00:43:26
changes.  Their nucleus gets
condensed, the DNA within the

535
00:43:26 --> 00:43:30
nucleus breaks up,
and then the cells themselves break

536
00:43:30 --> 00:43:34
up into small fragments called
apoptotic bodies,

537
00:43:34 --> 00:43:38
and then interestingly,
the cells that surround those cells,

538
00:43:38 --> 00:43:41
eat the damage.
It's like disposing of the body

539
00:43:41 --> 00:43:45
after a crime,
the cells are eliminated through a

540
00:43:45 --> 00:43:49
process of phagocytosis,
this is a very clean process then,

541
00:43:49 --> 00:43:53
there's very little junk, there's
very little cellular debris that

542
00:43:53 --> 00:43:56
remains when this process of
programmed cell death is completed.

543
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00
This is a normal looking lymphocyte,
and this is a lymphocyte undergoing

544
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
cell death.  It's like,
you know, this is your brain,

545
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08
this is your brain on drugs, this is
a cell, this is a cell undergoing

546
00:44:08 --> 00:44:12
apoptosis.
It's a fairly violent death,

547
00:44:12 --> 00:44:16
at least visually.  This movie shows
you an example of that.

548
00:44:16 --> 00:44:20
Here are cells undergoing apoptosis,
I hope.

549
00:44:20 --> 00:44:27
Maybe not.  Oh well.

550
00:44:27 --> 00:44:30
It comes from your book,
so you can see it yourselves,

551
00:44:30 --> 00:44:33
in fear that that would happen,
I'll show you another set of stills.

552
00:44:33 --> 00:44:36
Here are normal cells growing in
the tissue culture dish,

553
00:44:36 --> 00:44:39
you add some agent which induces
apoptosis, the cells begin to round

554
00:44:39 --> 00:44:42
up as you can see here,
and their cell surfaces actually

555
00:44:42 --> 00:44:45
become this horrible mess of
blebbing membrane,

556
00:44:45 --> 00:44:48
and they will eventually break up,
as you can see starting to happen

557
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
here.
So apoptosis is critical and

558
00:44:52 --> 00:44:56
actually very,
very interesting.

559
00:44:56 --> 00:45:00
As I said, too much cell death can
give rise to various diseases,

560
00:45:00 --> 00:45:04
neurodegeneration stroke is
complicated because of the effects

561
00:45:04 --> 00:45:08
of apoptosis, too much apoptosis,
even in AIDS, there's a lot of cell

562
00:45:08 --> 00:45:12
death that takes place in apoptosis,
and too little cell death, as I said,

563
00:45:12 --> 00:45:16
is important in cancer,
autoimmune disease, and certain

564
00:45:16 --> 00:45:19
viral infections.
Importantly, we know about the genes

565
00:45:19 --> 00:45:23
that are regulated in cell death,
that regulate cell death, through

566
00:45:23 --> 00:45:26
genetic experiments.
And here, the genetic experiments

567
00:45:26 --> 00:45:29
were performed,
in large part, at MIT,

568
00:45:29 --> 00:45:33
by a professor in the biology
department named Bob Horvitz.

569
00:45:33 --> 00:45:36
He took comfort in the fact that
the process in C.

570
00:45:36 --> 00:45:39
elegans, a simple worm,
has very many similarities to the

571
00:45:39 --> 00:45:43
process that I've outlined to you,
and therefore, he hoped that the

572
00:45:43 --> 00:45:46
genes that regulate programmed cell
death in C. elegans,

573
00:45:46 --> 00:45:50
were similar to the ones that do so
in mammals.

574
00:45:50 --> 00:45:54
And so he then undertook a study to
ask what genes regulate the cell

575
00:45:54 --> 00:45:58
death process in this simple
organism called C.

576
00:45:58 --> 00:46:02
elegans, which as an adult has only
1,090 cells.  And the beauty of this

577
00:46:02 --> 00:46:06
organism is that you can actually
see through it during development,

578
00:46:06 --> 00:46:10
and you can therefore follow the
fate of individual cells over the

579
00:46:10 --> 00:46:14
course of development.
And he and his students and fellows

580
00:46:14 --> 00:46:18
did that, he observed that in the
development of certain cell lineages

581
00:46:18 --> 00:46:22
of the developing worm,
individual cells died.

582
00:46:22 --> 00:46:27
In fact, about 130 cells underwent
this process of apoptosis.

583
00:46:27 --> 00:46:32
And then he carried out a genetic
experiment.  He asked,

584
00:46:32 --> 00:46:38
if I mutagenize worms, can I find
ones in which this process doesn't

585
00:46:38 --> 00:46:43
happen, or perhaps,
in which this process happens too

586
00:46:43 --> 00:46:49
much.  What are the genes that
regulate apoptosis?

587
00:46:49 --> 00:46:54
And he found several such genes
that turn viable cells into cells

588
00:46:54 --> 00:47:00
that have undergone programmed cell
death, or apoptosis.

589
00:47:00 --> 00:47:05
In particular,
there were two genes that positively

590
00:47:05 --> 00:47:10
regulated this process.
They were called Ced-3 and Ced-4.

591
00:47:10 --> 00:47:15
They were required for apoptosis to
occur.  Mutants in Ced-3 and Ced-4

592
00:47:15 --> 00:47:21
didn't have this cell death process
in those developing worms.

593
00:47:21 --> 00:47:26
And another gene called Ced-9 was
required to prevent apoptosis.

594
00:47:26 --> 00:47:32
In a Ced-9 mutant, there was too
much apoptosis going on, OK?

595
00:47:32 --> 00:47:38
They then cloned these genes,
and it turned out they all have

596
00:47:38 --> 00:47:44
homologs, versions,
in our cells, and those genes in our

597
00:47:44 --> 00:47:50
cells likewise regulate apoptosis in
us.  And we now know that at least

598
00:47:50 --> 00:47:56
members of this family of genes are
important in diseases,

599
00:47:56 --> 00:48:02
including cancer.  I'll just mention
the function of one gene,

600
00:48:02 --> 00:48:08
right now.  Ced-3, it is a protease,
which cleaves target proteins --

601
00:48:08 --> 00:48:22
-- into fragments.

602
00:48:22 --> 00:48:26
So, one of the key things that
happens in apoptosis is,

603
00:48:26 --> 00:48:30
you turn on this enzyme,
this protease, and it goes around

604
00:48:30 --> 00:48:34
cutting up various target proteins,
which eventually lead to the death

605
00:48:34 --> 00:48:38
of the cell.  There are many target
proteins that get cleaved when these

606
00:48:38 --> 00:48:43
caspases, these proteases are called
caspases, when these proteases get

607
00:48:43 --> 00:48:47
activated, and I just gave you one
example of one such target.

608
00:48:47 --> 00:48:51
There's an enzyme that is normally
involved in cleaving your DNA,

609
00:48:51 --> 00:48:55
this is a DNA gel, of viable cells
and cells that have undergone

610
00:48:55 --> 00:49:00
apoptosis after a certain
number of hours.

611
00:49:00 --> 00:49:04
The DNA of the cells is normally
intact, and large,

612
00:49:04 --> 00:49:09
because this enzyme is kept in check.
However, when its inhibitor is

613
00:49:09 --> 00:49:13
cleaved by the caspsase,
it now goes about cleaving the DNA,

614
00:49:13 --> 00:49:18
and this is one of the reasons why
apoptotic cells die,

615
00:49:18 --> 00:49:22
because their DNA gets cut up into
very small fragments.

616
00:49:22 --> 00:49:27
There are a number of other targets,
you can read a little bit more about

617
00:49:27 --> 00:49:31
this in your book,
I apologize that we had to rush

618
00:49:31 --> 00:49:36
through apoptosis,
it is important, and we will in fact

619
00:49:36 --> 00:49:39
come back to it in a discussion
of cancer.
