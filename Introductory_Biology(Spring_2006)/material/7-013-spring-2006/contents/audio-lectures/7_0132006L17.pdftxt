7.013 Introductory Biology, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 17 

We're going to continue our discussion today about cell biology, and specifically 
about the subject of signalling which we talked about in general terms last time.  I 
gave you some of the general principles about signaling, signal propagation and 
signal processing in biological systems. 

And today we're going to talk about two specific examples.  First a short-range 
response which results in the production of second messenger cyclic AMP and 
the results of that in terms of downstream events.  And the second will be an 
example of a long-range response which requires new gene expression, 
specifically in the stimulation of cells to divide.  And the example I'll give you in 
the context of wound healing. 

So just to finish up what I started at the end of last lecture. 

As I mentioned, the energy associated with the binding of a single ligand to a 
single receptor molecule at the cell's surface is insufficient to trigger any of the 
downstream events that are necessary either for the short-term or long-term 
responses. 

And so it's necessary that the signal be amplified.  And there are various ways 
that this happens.  The first, which I mentioned last time, is the production of 
molecules which we refer to as second messengers.  Second because they are 
not the primary thing.  The primary thing is the ligand binding to the receptor. 
They come after that messenger because they transmit the message related to 
the binding of the ligand to the receptor inside the cell.  And the example that I 
mentioned and that we'll talk about in more detail today is a second messenger 
called cyclic AMP or cAMP. 

I also mentioned that there are examples of enzymatic cascades.  And, again, 
the purpose here is to amplify the signal.  One enzyme turns on another enzyme 
which turns on many more enzymes, et cetera.  It's like a pyramid effect where 
something little grows to something big.  And the example I gave you last time 
was the analogy to dominos. 

Pushing one over basically spreads the signal down the chain.  So signal 
amplification with respect to second messengers, the principle is quite simple. 
Imagine an enzyme which is in an inactive state.  The binding of ligand to 
receptor makes that enzyme go to an active state. 

And in its active state it can convert a substrate into a product.  Now, if that 
product can stimulate a second enzyme, imagine enzyme two, which is in an 
inactive state now in the presence of this product, is converted to an active state, 
you've amplified the signal. 

You've turned on a lot of enzymes which make even more of this product which 
now stimulate yet another enzyme.  So this process then results in a form of 
signal amplification.  The same is true for enzyme cascades.  If you imagine an 
enzyme which is in an inactive state.  The binding of a ligand to a receptor 
converts that enzyme to an active state. 

If that enzyme now acts on another enzyme, E2 goes from inactive state to an 
active state, and that enzyme then acts on another enzyme, E3 goes from an 
inactive state to an active state, again, you've gone from a relatively small 
amount of stimulus propagated through the stimulation of this enzymatic activity, 
which acts on a number of these to make even more of these active, which acts 
on even more of these to make even more of these active, again, one develops 
signal amplification.  OK? 

Now, these changes that take place, both in the generation of second 
messenger, as well as in the turning on of enzymes, often result from changes in 
protein states.  I tried to give you indications last time that proteins are not static 
things.  They can move, they can interact, and they can actually change shape. 
And changes in protein states are often reflected in changes in protein structure, 
subtle changes in protein structure, but nevertheless changes in protein 
structure. 

And these can come in noncovalent forms.  The protein is not changed by any 
new covalent bonds but by binding to something in a noncovalent interaction. 
And the classic example of this are G-binding proteins. 

These proteins bind guanine nucleotides.  That's why they're called G-binding 
proteins.  And they're often shortened and referred to as G proteins.  We'll meet 
two G proteins later in today's lecture.  G proteins change their structure 
depending on whether or not they're bound to GTP or GDP.  Typically, in their 
inactive state, they're bound to GDP.  However, in response to a signal 
transduction pathway, there's an exchange event whereby GTP binds to the 
molecule and GDP is released. 

This reaction is usually catalyzed by another protein known as a nucleotide 
exchange factor.  We're exchanging this nucleotide for this nucleotide, and in so 
doing we change the shape of the molecule. 

When it's bound to GTP now it has a different shape.  And by virtue of this 
different shape, it might now be able to interact preferentially with another 

molecule.  So imagine that we have a signaling molecule which has a shape that 
looks something like this. 

A signaling protein.  Given the lack of complementarity between this shape and 
this shape, these proteins will not interact.  However, upon nucleotide exchange 
such that the protein now binds GTP and now changes its shape, now we can 
get a productive interaction between the G protein and the signaling molecule. 

And this can lead to a form of signal amplification.  OK?  So that's an example of 
a noncovalent change, and a reversible one.  The GTP can be hydrolyzed --

-- back to GDP, thereby shutting the signal off.  OK?  Another example of a 
structural change in a protein but now a covalent one --

-- is in the form of phosphorylation.  So imagine that we have a protein here, an 
enzyme which is in its inactive state. 

And this protein has among its amino acids, in some critical position, an amino 
acid with a hydroxyl residue.  Does anybody remember back in the Dark Ages 
when you were learning your amino acid structures which amino acids have 
hydroxyl residues?  I'm tempted to offer money to anybody who would remember 
all three.  Anybody.  Does anybody remember even one? 

Serine it is.  Yes, that's one.  Serine.  Anything else?  Tyrosine is another.  Very 
good.  And the last one?  Threonine.  So these three amino acids have hydroxyl 
residues.  And by virtue of that they are subject to, or can be subject to protein 
phosphorylation at the hands of enzymes, which I've referred to in previous 
lectures, called protein kinases. 

These proteins can be modified such that they have a phosphate group on them. 
And this can change the structure of the protein and make it go from an inactive 
to an active state.  There are actually examples where it goes the other way, 
phosphorylation takes an active protein and makes it inactive, but you see the 
point. 

Phosphorylation can change the activity.  And, once again, this is reversible. 
There are protein phosphatases which will remove the phosphate and return the 
protein to its baseline state.  OK?  So just to give you an example of how this 
might be useful. 

Imagine that I have an enzyme here which has an active site, but this active site, 
by virtue of the confirmation of the protein, is closed.  That is the substrates 
cannot get in there in order to be modified.  At the hands of a specific kinase that 
might recognize a hydroxyl residue right here, the shape of this protein might 
change. 

So now the active site becomes open and the enzyme becomes active.  OK?

And likewise this can be reversed through the action of a phosphatase.  OK?  So

protein structures change, activities of proteins, enzymes change.  And that's one

way in which we can propagate signals.


OK.  So let's now go to a specific example.  And the example that I want to give

you is one that hopefully not many of you are familiar with.  If you're camping and

you run across this fellow here, what is your immediate reaction?  You run.  You

run. You never try to feed the bear a marshmallow with your mouth.  That's the

first thing I learned about camping, you run.  This is the famous fight or flight

response.


And when you're dealing with a bear, you want to take the flight option.  It's 

stimulated by fear, some perception of fear.  And upon perception of fear --


-- through a complex physiology, a small molecule is released from your adrenal

glands.  Glands that sit on top of your kidneys.  This molecule is called

epinephrine, otherwise known as adrenaline.  So this is released from your

adrenal glands and various things happen.  One, that we're going to spend a little

time talking about, is that your blood glucose levels go up.  Why?  Why do you

want your blood glucose levels to go up when you see this fellow here?  So you

can run.


Remember, that's the first thing you want to do when you see a bear, run.  In

addition, your heart rate goes up so you can pump more blood to your big

muscles, your breathing rate goes up so you can oxygenate those muscles, and

your blood pressure goes up.  And there are other things that happen as well, but

these are the most important with respect to the fight and flight response.


This happens because this hormone, epinephrine, triggers all of these

responses, actually in different cells within your body.  Because it's acting at

distance sites within your body, from the adrenal glands to the muscles to the

liver to the heart to your brain, this is referred to as an endocrine response.  An

endocrine response is basically defined as hormones acting at a distance.


OK?  Produced somewhere.  Acting somewhere else in your body.  We

differentiate that with the paracrine response in which there is a local release of

growth factors and other ligands.


So here there's a local issue.  Something happens locally, factors are released

right in the environment, and they act upon cells right in their neighborhood.  And

finally a related turn called autocrine which is cells --


-- which release the factor and bind it themselves.  Autocrine.  So they stimulate

themselves.  And very often you'll start a process one of these ways.  And then


the cell will take over.  Basically amplifying the signal for itself.  OK?  Now, in the 
example that I want to talk about in the first portion of the lecture. 

We're going to deal with this one here, blood glucose, the increase levels of 
blood glucose. 

As you probably know, your body stores energy different ways.  One way is in a 
polymer of glucose called glycogen, which is stored in your liver.  Another way is 
through the storage of fat. 

For this response we want to liberate the energy that's stored in the form of 
glycogen and turn it into glucose which is much more consumable. It can be used 
directly by your muscles to make ATP which drives various reactions like 
contractions and so on.  So the analogy here is money in your bank account 
versus money in your wallet. 

When you're in a situation like that, you want to transfer money from your bank 
account to your wallet.  That's the direction we're heading in this example.  In 
others situations, where you've just had a huge meal and you're not running from 
a bear, you go the other way.  You take glucose and you turn it into glycogen, 
which I said is a polymer of glucose.  Now, this balance between glycogen and 
glucose is controlled by enzymes which are sort of in the center of today's 
example. 

In this direction the enzyme is glycogen phosphorylase.  Glycogen 
phosphorylase is the last enzyme that breaks down glycogen into a form of 
glucose that can be then further metabolized.  Glycogen phosphorylase.  And the 
other, in the other direction, is an enzyme called glycogen synthase.  OK? 

So the goal of this reaction, or set of signals, will be to stimulate this process and 
actually inhibit this process.  And you'll see how that's done in a second.  This is 
epinephrine.  Again, it's a small chemical produced by your adrenal glands.  As I 
said earlier, it's released during the flight or fight response.  It binds to a class of 
receptors which I'll take you through.  They're called beta-adrenergic receptors 

because they bind to a factor produced in the adrenal glands, beta-adrenergic 
receptors.  These are receptors, as you'll see, that have a complex tortuous root 
through the membrane.  They go through the membrane seven times.  They're 
actually sometimes referred to as serpentine receptors for that reason.  And they 
bind to and activate GTP binding proteins, G proteins, as I mentioned down here. 
And this is a particular form of G protein called trimeric G proteins.  And you'll see 
why in a second. 

As I mentioned, epinephrine binds to cells in different parts of the body resulting 
in various physiological effects.  The ones I listed here and another one which I 
didn't list here which I find paradoxical.  Actually, I know what, I know what the 

evolutionary advantage to all of these things is, but I don't know what the 
evolutionary advantage is to the relaxation of the smooth muscles around the 
colon during the fight or flight response.  Some of you may have felt this before 
when you're extremely fearful.  I'm not sure why it is our bodies do that. 

But anyway.  OK.  So how does this work? 

So we're going to consider just the mobilization of glucose.  And the site of action 
is the liver.  That's where glycogen is stored.  And on the cells in the liver, the 
hepatocytes, on the plasma membrane of those cells, there are these receptors, 
these serpentine receptors. 

They look like that.  They look like snakes, as I mentioned.  Beta-adrenergic 
receptors.  There are also alpha-adrenergic receptors, but we're going to focus 
on beta-adrenergic receptors.  And these bind to epinephrine directly.  So here's 
our molecule of epinephrine. 

It physically binds to a portion of the polypeptide chain that's sticking out from the 
cell's surface.  Now, bound on the inside to this receptor is this trimeric G protein. 
It's called trimeric because there are three subunits.  There's an alpha subunit, a 
beta subunit and a gamma subunit. 

And in this configuration, prior to the binding of epinephrine, the alpha subunit is 
bound to GDP.  And, as I mentioned before, that's usually associated with 
inactivity.  So the alpha subunit is inactive.  The binding of epinephrine to the 
surface has two effects.  The first is an exchange wherein the alpha subunit now 
binds GTP. 

And the GDP that was present there comes off.  The other effect is that the G 
protein, the alpha subunit releases from the beta and gamma subunits and they 
float away.  In this, now GTP-bound configuration, the alpha subunit is now 
active.  And it can move from this position to another position within the 
membrane and bind to another protein. 

In this case an enzyme called adenylate cyclase.  The GTP bound version of the 
alpha subunit associates with adenylate cyclase, thereby converting it to an 
active form.  When bound to this it becomes active. 

And the consequence of that is that the adenylate cyclase can now convert ATP 
to the second messenger cyclic AMP.  OK?  And this process that we've gone 
through from binding of a single molecule to the production of a lot of a cyclic 
AMP is an example. 

OK?  We've made a lot of second messenger from the binding of a single 
molecule because we've turned on a lot of these, which can go on and turn on a 
lot of these, which can go on and make a lot of this. 

Now, there's another step in signal amplification here in this pathway.  There's an 
enzyme known as protein kinase A which becomes activated in the presence of 
cyclic AMP.  So protein kinase A in the presence of cyclic AMP goes from an 
inactive state to an active state. 

And when it becomes active it converts another enzyme, glycogen 
phosphorylase, which I mentioned to you a moment ago, from an inactive state to 
an active state. 

OK?  So this is a phosphorylation reaction, similar to the one that I drew up here. 
PKA phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, making it go from an inactive to an 
active state.  Another step of signal amplification.  We can make some of this 
active which makes a lot of this active. 

OK?  And this is the enzyme we needed to turn on in order to break down 
glycogen to glucose.  Now, there's another kind of cool thing that happens in the 
control of the reverse reaction, because it turns out that the enzyme responsible 
for making glycogen, glycogen synthase is inactivated in the presence of cyclic 
AMP. 

So it goes from an active state in the presence of cyclic AMP to an inactive state. 

So at once we turn that off, turn this on, and we can generate a lot of glucose. 
OK.  So this is the reaction.  We focused exclusively on the mobilization of 
glucose here. 

Just to remind you, this same pathway controls heart rate, breathing rate, blood 
flow.  And, actually, some of you might have heard of beta-blockers.  And beta-
blockers are used to control this exact reaction.  Beta-blockers bind to beta-
adrenergic receptors so that your body won't respond to adrenaline or 
epinephrine when you don't want it to. 

So people who get really nervous talking in front of audiences or taking exams in 
7.01 will sometimes take beta-blockers so that they don't suffer, you know, fast 
heart rate or this feeling of anxiety and so on.  OK.  So we've turned on this 
signal in response to binding of epinephrine to the cell's surface.  We've started 
all these happening.  How do we turn it off?  How do we deal with signal 
termination?  How do we turn the signal off? 

Anybody have any ideas?  Well, one might be not so obvious.  And that is --

-- a process which I introduced to you last time called pathway modulation in 
which the activation of a second pathway can actually inhibit the activation of the 
primary pathway. 

So, for example, I've been telling you about the beta-adrenergic receptors, which 
through the binding of this kicks off a series of events which results in the 
activation of this pathway.  There are many examples in biology where the 
binding of a second ligand to a distinct receptor results in the propagation of a 
signal which actually inhibits the first. 

So, for example, I mentioned here that there's a kinase that's activated, protein 
kinase A.  This pathway might activate the relevant phosphatase, thereby turning 
this signal down.  So modulation of the pathway, very important in biology.  We're 
only really beginning to appreciate how important it is the more we learn. 
Another obvious example is ligand diffusion.  You make a certain amount of 
ligand from your adrenal glands. 

And it just diffuses eventually or breaks down, thereby turning the signal off. 
There's also a phenomenon known as receptor internalization. 

Very often when a receptor binds to its ligand, it doesn't just stay out there on the 
surface but actually gets internalized inside the cell.  So I'll draw a different class 
of receptors here. 

Here's the receptor.  Here it's bound to its ligand.  I told you last time that 
proteins can get to the cell's surface through a complex sorting pathway that 
involves actually vesicles encapsulating the proteins and then bringing them to 
the cell surface.  Well, the reverse can happen as well where the proteins can be 
removed from the cell's surface into vesicles.  Removing them from the cell's 
surface then takes them away from the possibility of being activated, and thereby 
turning down the signal. 

Another possibility would be to degrade the second messenger.  OK?  Cyclic 
AMP is an example.  You need to make it in order to stimulate these various 
downstream events, so get rid of it.  And, in fact, there's a clear pathway for that 
process.  As I told you, ATP can be converted through the actions of adenylate 
cyclase to make cyclic AMP. 

But likewise there's an enzyme, actually, a whole class of enzymes known as 
phosphodiesterases which converts cyclic AMP to AMP, thereby inactivating the 
signal.  These enzymes are actually very important in pharmacology. 

There are lots of inhibitors of phosphodiesterases which stimulate the production 
or the maintenance of high levels of cyclic AMP and other cyclic nucleotides.  So 
caffeine for example, one of the reasons you get a buzz from caffeine is that it 
blocks a class of these enzymes leading to more cyclic AMP which gives you that 
kind of nervous energy.  OK?  Another related process involving another cyclic 
nucleotide, this time cyclic GTP. 

This is broken down by a different phosphodiesterase.  In Viagra and like 
chemicals are inhibitors of this class of phosphodiesterases, thereby leading to 
an over stimulation of that pathway.  And, finally, you can reverse the structural 
changes that I mentioned previously.  So I said earlier that enzymes can be 
activated through kinases. 

And they can be inactivated by phosphatases.  I'm going to have to move to a 
different board here.  And G proteins which get activated in the beginning of 
these processes, from a GDP bound form, through the action of exchange 
factors to the GTP bound form, can be inactivated by GTP hydrolysis. 

And this is often through proteins called GAPs, which are called GTPase 
activating proteins.  They activate the GTP hydrolysis activity of the G protein, 
thereby returning the G protein to its inactive state.  OK.  So that's the beta-
adrenergic signaling pathway.  It's a classic.  You should know it in principle and 
in some detail.  It's covered extensively in your book.  Here's a figure from your 
book. 

I won't go through the details of this because we just did them on the board, but 
just so you know it's in there.  Here's the production of the second messenger, 
cyclic AMP.  And then it triggers this kinase cascade that I drew up for you 
before, activation of PKA, activation of glycogen phosphorylase, and the 
production ultimately of glucose.  And here's the second messenger. 

I'm pleased to see that I put this in the book, in my slide set last year because the 
book had an incorrect structure for cyclic AMP in the previous edition.  I'm 
pleased to see they know have corrected the structure.  This is the actual proper 
structure of cyclic AMP. 

OK.  So now want to change signaling pathways and consider not what you do 
when you first encounter the bear, but what do you do, or what does your body 
do if you fail to successfully run from the bear?  So it's funny what you can find 
on the Web, boy.  You can find anything you want on the Web.  In fact, when I 
was looking up, I was pretty sure that Viagra blocked phosphodiesterases. 

I was pretty sure, but I wasn't certain so I did a Web search.  This is true.  I did a 
Web search.  And, God, I cannot believe what I came across.  It's unbelievable. 
But you can find some pretty nasty bear wounds on the Web as well, and here's 
one of them.  So this guy didn't run fast enough.  So what's going to happen? 
What is his body going to do following an injury such as that?  Well, obviously he 
needs to heal the wound. 

Your body is remarkable in its ability to detect damage and fix it.  So we're going 
to heal the wound.  And this is an example of one of these long-term effects of a 
signaling pathway.  Whereas, this was short-term, everything was happening in 
the cytoplasm, generation of glucose to be secreted.  This is a long-term effect. 

The effect has to take place ultimately in the nucleus because we need to turn on 
gene expression to convince cells to divide and heal the wound. 

This may be a troubling picture.  Maybe I should go back to the bear.  There.  So 
if we imagine the skin, which is a tight complex of cells forming a protective layer 
against the elements and so on keeping stuff out that should be out, in that 
should be in.  In a wound you breach that structure, you get a scratch. 

And one of the things that happens, as you bleed into that wound, is that small 
packets, former bits of cells called platelets bind to the edges of that wound.  And 
the platelets then release a factor imaginatively called platelet-derived growth 
factor. 

And platelet-derived growth factor, otherwise known as PDGF stimulates other 
cells to divide.  And specifically it stimulates cells called fibroblasts which sit 
underneath these cells normally as part of the connective tissue underneath the 
epithelial cells.  In the presence of PDGF, the fibroblasts proliferate. 

And this results in the formation of a scar.  OK?  And what we want to 
understand now is how is it that PDGF stimulates fibroblasts to divide? 

So we can model this process in cell culture.  We can extract fibroblasts from 
your skin and put them in a tissue culture dish, let's say one times ten to the fifth 
cells. 

So this is cell number on this axis and this is days in culture on this axis, one, 
two, three, four days.  If we plate 100,000 fibroblasts in a tissue culture dish, in 
the absence of growth factors they won't divide. 

They'll just sit there.  But if we add PDGF or other growth factors, the cells will 
divide, and therefore we'll see an increase in cell number.  So, again, the 
question is how does that happen?  What is the mechanism that allows that to 
happen? 

Oops.  What did I do? 

Well, here we're talking about another class of receptors.  These are called 
growth factor receptors.  And these are different from seven transmembrane 
receptors in that they have, on their cytoplasmic side, enzymatic activity, 
specifically kinase domains. 

These receptors are also enzymes.  And their enzymatic activity is to add 
phosphates to other proteins.  In this configuration, however, they're inactive. 
What the growth factor does is causes those receptors to dimerize with one 
another. 

To become in close proximity to one another.  So the growth factor serves to link 
them.  Here's our growth factor.  And in this now increased proximity, these 
kinase domains become active.  And the consequence of that is we get 
phosphorylation of the neighboring protein. 

We call this transphosphorylation. 

So ligand induced activation, transphosphorylation.  And now what we've done, 
on the inside of the cell, is to create a structure.  And it's the formation of that 
structure that then allows the rest of the process to work. 

These phosphorylated residues act as the binding sites for other proteins.  The 
first one is known as an adaptor protein. 

An adaptor protein which binds to a class of proteins to that I referred to 
previously, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.  And that then allows the 
exchange factor to stimulate the exchange of a small GTP binding protein, which 
is generally bound to GDP and inactive, to stimulate the exchange of GTP for 
GDP. 

This small GTP binding protein is a protein called RAS, a very important 
signaling molecule.  And, actually, a very important cancer molecule as well. 
Mutationally activated in a high percentage of cancers.  When you now have 
RAS in its GTP bound state, it can activate a kinase cascade. 

Which I'll go through with you on slides in a moment.  It first activates a protein 
called RAF which then activates a protein called MEK which then activates a 
protein called ERK.  ERK is a map kinase.  It's a kinase itself.  Its enzymatic 
activity is to phosphorylate other proteins. 

MEK phosphorylates ERK so it's called a map kinase kinase.  And RAF is a 
kinase itself which phosphorylates this kinase so it's referred to as a map kinase 
kinase kinase.  I'm not making it up.  OK?  So it stimulates a kinase cascade, 
similar to what I introduced you to before. 

And then, as you'll see, ERK, which is a cytoplasmic protein, moves from the 
cytoplasm into the nucleus.  I'll show this to you on slides, and it's in your book as 
well.  And in the nucleus this kinase phosphorylates transcription factors which 
then bind to target genes turning them on stimulating the cell to divide.  I would 
have drawn that for you but we're running out of time. 

So I will show it to you instead on the overheads.  There's our wound.  So here's 
the pathway.  It's just straight out of your book.  Here are the growth factor 
receptors, again, not dimerized, not active. The growth factor causes the two 
proteins to come together in close apposition.  This causes the kinase activities 
to get stimulated resulting in the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails. 

The adaptor protein then can bind to the phosphorylated tail.  This then 
stimulates through an exchange factor not shown here, the exchange of GDP for 
GTP, making an active RAS molecule.  This then can activate RAF making it now 
an active kinase which activates MEK making it an active kinase which activates 
ERK called map K here for map kinase. 

This now goes into the nucleus of the cell from the cytoplasm, and in the 
cytoplasm it can encounter transcription factors.  It then phosphorylates those 
transcription factors which bind to their target genes turning on gene expression 
and leading to a change in the cellular phenotype.  And the change in the cellular 
phenotype that we're talking about here is cell division, the details of which we'll 
cover next time.  So this is sort of a static picture. 

But to give you a more dynamic picture of what's happening here, I borrowed 
from the Biocreations Website an animation, which I find very helpful and, 
actually, is kind of funny as well.  So we're going to start this process much the 
same way that we've just talked about using the terms that I used on the board. 
Oop.  We need sound.  Let's do that again so you can hear it in all its glory.  OK. 

So the first thing is the receptors get dimerized by the growth factor leading to the 
phosphorylation of these cytoplasmic tails.  And then this protein, which is the 
adaptor, it's called grab-2 grabs onto one of those phosphorylation sites.  It has 
attached to it an exchange factor called SAS here.  OK?  So that's the first thing 
that happens. You recruit this signaling complex to the membrane.  Once you 
have it there it's now in close proximity to RAS which is, if you remember, a 
membrane associated protein.  It's now in its inactive stage, its GDP bound state. 

Oops.  Sorry.  We'll just have to watch that again.  Oh, no.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait. 
Go back.  Forget you saw that.  That's the end.  You never want to see the 
ending.  Oh, wait a minute.  OK.  Here we go.  OK. 

So next we're going to activate RAS.  It gets a little kick in the butt.  GDP comes 
off.  GTP comes on.  Now RAS is active.  It's now capable of interacting 
productively with RAF, the first of these kinases, the map kinase kinase kinase. 
And it's going to cause it to become active.  Once it's active it's now capable of 
activating the next guy in line, which is MEK. 

Now MEK is active, and it's going to phosphorylate ERK, and now ERK is 
phosphorylated and active.  Now, there have been a couple of other steps, which 
you can look at, at home, but the RAS went from a GTP bound stage to a GDP 
bound state.  I told you that you can turn these signals off up here.  That happens 
in this pathway.  Another GAP comes along and turns RAS off.  And here's a 
protein phosphatase, which is going to clip off the phosphate, thereby turning 
MEK off.  So each of these steps is reversible. 

But, importantly, we're down here at this level where ERK has been 
phosphorylated.  And now it's capable, dammit.  All right.  We'll have to watch it 
again.  Wait a minute.  Come on.  OK.  Here we go.  I know.  It's like a video 
game.  OK. 

So ERK is active.  And now it's going to go in the nucleus.  Phosphorylate Jun, 
one of these transcription factors.  And upon doing so the transcription factors 
dimerize, bind to the promoter of a target gene.  They recruit RNA polymerase. 
And this leads to the production of new gene expression.  mRNAs that go into 
the cytoplasm get translated into proteins that convince the cell now it's time to 
divide.  OK? 

So I encourage you to look at this to get the details.  Now, if you just wait one 
more second.  In the last 30 seconds I want to point out the fact that these 
pathways, while we're teaching to you as simple linear pathways, are actually 
highly complex.  Pay attention to this clock here.  It's 11:54.  Highly complex, 
highly interactive, not linear, and therefore we frequently analogize what's 
happening inside a living cell to an integrated circuit. 

And increasingly these days in biology, we're thinking about these things in 
analogy with computers, and actually relying extensively on computers to help us 
understand how that complexity actually works using methods from chemistry 
and physics and mathematics and other disciplines in a new and emerging area 
called systems biology, which you might be interested in.  And the new Biological 
Engineering major will have a strong focus in this area.  OK.
