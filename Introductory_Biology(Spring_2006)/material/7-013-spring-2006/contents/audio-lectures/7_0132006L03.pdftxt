7.013 Introductory Biology, Spring 2006 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 3 

Cancer is a disease that really needs no introduction.  It's a very 
familiar disease.  It's a very common disease. 

The American Cancer Society predicts that there will be 1.4 million 
new cases of cancer in this country, and that excludes the common 
forms of skin cancer, squamous cell cancer, and basal cell cancer. 

There's about another million of those.  So, 1.4 non-cutaneous skin 
cancers in the US this year.  Both wide numbers are probably 10 to 15 
times as many.  In 2006, more than 550,000 people in the US --

More than 550,000 people in the US will die from this disease --

-- more than 1,500 each day.  So, in today's, cancer takes as many 
lives as died in the World Trade Center tragedy.  It's a very common 
disease. 

It's estimated that in their lifetimes, one half of all males --

-- and a third of females will be diagnosed with cancer of one sort or 
another.  So the likelihood is that the person sitting next to you, or 
you yourself will be faced with a diagnosis of cancer in your lifetime. 

And in this country, a quarter of all deaths are due to cancer.  Soon, 
probably this year, cancer will be the leading cause of death in the 
United States.  It will surpass heart disease as the number one killer. 
So, it's a major disease.  And that sounds depressing. 

But by the end of this section on cancer, my hope is that you will 
actually feel optimistic about our prospects for dealing with the disease 
more effectively in the future, and I don't mean in the distant future.  I 
actually think that within the next several years, we'll have new 
methods, new agents to control cancer much, much more effectively. 
We are already starting to see the first examples of these.  And I'll tell 
you about them. 

And before long, we will have many more.  So hopefully by the time 
you guys are at the age where cancer is the greatest risk, these 
numbers will actually change dramatically.  OK, so although cancer is 
familiar based on its prevalence, it may not be so familiar.  And I hope 
that is not so familiar in detail.  So, I thought I would show you a 
couple of slides which really give you a picture of the disease. 

Lung cancer is a common type of cancer.  We'll talk about it today. 
And it's diagnosed like many cancers are diagnosed through 
radiological methods, through imaging, in this case a chest x-ray or 
[NOISE OBSCURES] which is a serial chest x-ray basically.  And, you 
can see this mass in the lung.  This is lung cancer at a fairly advanced 
stage.  Cancer is a disease of too many cells.  They often grow 
together in a mass, a lump, and so this is an example of cancer 
diagnosis, a solid tumor. 

You can also have cancers of the blood, leukemias, as well as blood 
cell lymphomas.  And here, you can, again, see an overabundance of 
cells.  Here's a normal blood smear with red blood cells, these smaller 
guys which have no nuclei, and some white blood cells which are 
larger and do have nuclei.  And here, you can see a blood smear of a 
leukemia patient where there are way too many white blood cells, 
nucleated cells, and they also happen to look a little immature. 

They have been differentiated into their fully developed state.  Too 
many cells, in this case, not in a lump but dispersed throughout the 
blood.  And leukemias, and some lymphomas, are diagnosed by doing 
a blood test of this sort.  Other cancers are detected through other 
imaging techniques like colonoscopy as shown here. 

Colonoscopies are now fairly common.  They are recommended for all 
people beyond the age of 50 because colon tumors are actually rather 
common.  And if they are caught early enough, there relatively easily 
treated.  And here's the normal colon viewed from the inside.  And 
here's an early colon tumor called a polyp.  And I'll give you a little 
more nomenclature in a minute.  But this is an early stage tumor, 
probably not a malignant tumor. 

If you saw this tumor, you might not actually remove it because it 
might not progress to a full-scale cancer.  But, these days, because 
they're pretty easy to remove using very similar methods as this 
gentleman here with the colonoscopy, one would [clip?] them out, and 
not risk the possibility that they could progress.  If they do progress, 
they get larger.  And more importantly, they begin to invade through 

the wall of the colon.  And this is very dangerous because now the 
cancer cells can spread throughout the body, taking up residence 
elsewhere and causing even greater problems for the patient. 

So, this would require surgery.  A section of the colon would be 
removed as is shown here.  This is a section of colon where the colon 
cancer is highlighted by this circle.  And, this is a life sparing surgery. 
Individuals can live just fine.  So if colon cancer is caught even at this 
stage, an advanced stage, but before it has spread to other parts of 
the body, it's relatively treatable, even curable by surgical methods. 

Now, this set of pictures gives you a sense that cancers progress. 
They progress from early-stage, relatively normal looking tissue 
through much more advanced cancers, including to the point of 
metastasis.  And we are beginning to understand this process in some 
detail both in terms of what the cells look like, the tissues look like, 
but also what the genes look like that are driving these processes 
forward. 

And I'm now going to give you some examples, or introduce the 
concept, that cancer progression from normalcy to malignancy is 
associated with changes in genes.  That's really going to be a major 
theme of today and in the following lectures.  But, histologically, the 
process looks like this in cartoon form.  One starts with a normal 
looking tissue.  All of your cells are organized in one way or another in 
tissues, where they have important interactions with their neighboring 
cells: so here, a series of, say, epithelial cells. 

Maybe these are the cells that line your gut.  They are in normal 
juxtaposition with their neighbors.  They are sitting atop what's called 
a basement membrane, proteins that are secreted by those cells and 
other cells to give the cell something literally to sit on it, attach to. 
And then there are other cells in their vicinity including the cells that 
give rise to these cells, the stem cells or precursor cells, of the tissue 
that will be called on to differentiate into these end stage cells when 
these cells are lost, sloughed off. 

At some frequency in all of us, alterations occur in these cells such 
that an abnormal cell arises.  This is a cell which has acquired a 
change.  I'll tell you now that it's a genetic change which allows that 
cell to do things that its neighbors can't do.  And in particular, it allows 
those cells to grow, to divide inappropriately.  Your tissues are very 
carefully orchestrated systems with the appropriate numbers of cells. 

And cancer is fundamentally a disease of too many cells.  And so one 
of the first things to go wrong in the cancer development process is 
this orderly cell division is disrupted such that now, too many cells are 
produced.  And, this results in a phenomena known as hyperplasia, 
hyperplasia meaning too many cells. 

But, importantly these cells look pretty normal.  So to the pathologist, 
and I'll show you some pathology slides in a second, to the 
pathologist, they would say the abnormal cells in number have a 
normal morphology.  Their shape looks right.  Their internal structures 
look right.  Their nuclei look right.  This process can continue, and 
probably often does continue until there is a discernible mass at least 
when it comes to solid tumors, a discernible mass. 

And here we refer to this as an adenoma.  And I'll show you these 
terms again in a minute on the board, in this case, an adenoma, a 
benign tumor.  And you heard that were before, benign, as opposed to 
malignant.  And a benign tumor is a tumor in the sense that there are 
too many cells.  So it's a mass.  But the cells look pretty normal.  In a 
benign tumor, it's not considered to be life-threatening.  The cells have 
not undergone sufficient changes that we know for sure that they're 
going to, for example, invade and spread throughout the body. 

And oftentimes, benign tumors are left alone because they don't have 
the potential to spread or to become more aggressive.  But, some of 
them do.  And through additional changes within the cells, additional 
alterations take place such that now the cells really do look different 
from the neighbors.  Their structures look different.  Their overall 
shape looks different.  Their nuclei look different.  Their interactions 
with the neighboring cells look different. 

And the structure of the tissue changes as well in the sense that now, 
new blood vessels have been recruited into this mass, which was 
important actually in feeding this growing tumor.  This is true cancer. 
It's called [in C2?] cancer because it's present at the original site 
where the process started in C2 cancer.  And, it's called cancer based 
on these various characteristics: how much the cells are growing, 
dividing, and also what the cells look like, their shape and their nuclear 
shape. 

That's a problem.  But it's a bigger problem because it facilitates and 
usually leads to the development of these tumors into an invasive 
state.  So now, the cells are no longer staying where they started. 
They are starting to move out into the surrounding tissue.  They break 

down, degrade the extracellular matrix, and actually start to migrate 
away from the primary tumor into the surrounding tissue, into the 
surrounding musculature, and ultimately into the blood vessels. 

It can move into the blood vessels.  And once there, they can move 
throughout the body, and escape the blood vessels, and take up 
residence elsewhere in a process known as metastasis.  This process 
happens at some frequency once started.  If it reaches this point, it's a 
very bad situation.  Most cancers that kill people, kill people because 
of this process of metastasis. 

90% of cancer deaths are attributable to metastasis.  And, although 
we know many of the things that happened over the course of these 
earlier stages, we actually know this process relatively less well.  And 
obviously, we need to understand it better if we are going to control 
mortalities due to cancer. 

This shows you some histology.  These are slices through tumors and 
other tissue that a pathologist would look at, and kind of emphasizes 
the points that I was making on an earlier slide in cartoon form.  So, 
here you have a lung.  And in it is some abnormal cells in the red circle 
here.  There are too many cells compared to the surrounding tissue. 
You can see them in this kind of dark blue depiction.  And you'll see it 
easier on your computer screens later. 

But again, these cells look relatively normal.  There are just too many 
of them.  So we call this hyperplasia.  These can progress into small 
and benign tumors called, in this case, adenomas.  And, you can see 
on the histology that they are rather homogeneous in their structure. 
The cytoplasm looks pretty much the same.  Cell to cell, the nuclei 
look pretty much the same cell to cell.  And they actually look pretty 
similar to the normal cells that surround them.  So this is not true 
cancer. 

This is a benign tumor.  But it can progress to a true cancer, 
adenocarcinomas.  And you can see from the high magnification view 
that this looks very different from this.  The cells don't look the same 
one to the other, and their nuclei don't look the same either.  And, 
what you can't appreciate is that these cells are also dividing at a 
much greater rate compared to these cells.  And so, this is true 
cancer.  And this has the potential, then, to spread to metastatic 
disease. 

OK, so I've given you, there, all bunch of terminology.  Let me tell you 
a bit more about it. 

Hyperplasia: too many cells.  That's all it means.  Hyper: too many. 
Plasia: growth, too much growth. 

Hyperplasias can result in benign tumors, which are non-aggressive --

-- nondestructive --

And they, at this moment at least, have not spread to nearby tissue, 
non-aggressive meaning that the cells look pretty normal.  They don't 
look different from their normal neighbors. 

These can give rise to malignant tumors.  And the word cancer is 
actually reserved for malignant tumors.  If you have a tumor that's 
benign, you don't have cancer.  Cancer refers to malignant tumors. 
And these are different in the sense that they are aggressive. 

The cells are much more active.  They've changed their shape. 
They've changed their structures. 

They are destructive, that is, they secrete factors into the 
environment, which break down, for example, extracellular matrix. 

And they have the potential to spread.  They've begun to invade into 
the local environment, and can't access the blood supply.  OK, there 
are cancers in many of your organs in many different cell types within 
those organs.  In the cancers in different places in your body are 
referred to by different terms. 

For epithelial tissues, skin, intestines, breast, brain, lung, epithelial 
tissues, we call the tumors carcinomas. 

Carcinomas, and depending on the particular cells that are affected, 
whether they are glandular cells or secretory cells, we can give them 
additional names, for example, an adenocarcinoma. 

And that's a cancer that looks like the glands that give rise to the 
tumor in adenocarcinoma.  And there could be adenocarcinomas in the 
different places that I mentioned previously.  And there are benign 
versions of this tumors.  And for adenocarcinomas, the benign version 
the adenoma. 

You can get tumors of connective tissues, and these are referred to as 
sarcomas.  And there could be different sarcomas depending on where 
they are found, for example, various types of myosarcomas would be 
found in what type of tissue? 

These are muscle tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas. 
Another example are chondrosarcomas --

-- which are tumors of cartilage.  In this class of tumors, which are 
called soft tissue tumors, were in the news just today as a matter of 
fact, front page of the Boston Globe if you happen to see it.  There is a 
site, a former dye factory that was dumping pollutants into ponds and 
Ashland. 

And they've just determined that the exposure to those dyes greatly 
increased the risk of children to later develop soft tissue sarcomas. 
Several children then turning into 20, 30 year olds developed tumors 
of this type which fits to the theme of the lecture in terms of 
exposures leading to cancers. 

Tumors of the blood system are referred to by different names, 
leukemias --

-- in which the tumor cells are in the blood, B cell leukemias, T cell 
leukemias, erythroleukemias, myeloid leukemias where the cells are in 
the bloodstream like the one I showed you before, and lymphomas 
where the tumors are in the lymph organs like the spleen or the 
thymus or the lymph nodes.  So, that gives you some terminology. 
And I'll be referring to some of this terminology as we go through the 
remaining lectures. 

And it's just useful to know as you learn about and hear about 
cancers. 

Now, cancer research, over the last several decades has been 
dedicated to try to understand this process of normalcy to malignancy. 
How does that happen? 

And the conclusion from all of this work, which I will review for you is 
that cancer is a genetic disease.  What do I mean by that?  What do I 
mean by cancer is a genetic disease?  Does anybody want to hazard a 
guess?  What do we normally think of when we talk about genetic 
diseases?  Heritable diseases, predispositions to disease, we talked 
about several of them previously in the class like cystic fibrosis and 
many others. 

Cancer can be a genetic disease in that sense.  There can be inherited 
predispositions to certain cancers.  And I'll mention some in later 
lectures.  But in fact, all cancers are genetic diseases.  All cancers 
arise through alterations in your genes.  Those alterations in most 
cases are not inherited from one of your parents but are acquired 
through your lifetimes through mistakes or exposures to things that 
cause such changes. 

Why do we believe this so strongly?  Well, firstly, and this has been 
known for some time, cancer cells don't look normal chromosomally. 
If you look at the chromosomes of normal cells, they're all the same. 
All have 46 chromosomes.  The chromosomes have proper structures 
but when you look at cancer cells, that's not true. 

For most cancers, in contrast to the normal karyotype, the normal 
chromosomal number in architecture, and this is an image which 
highlights the different chromosomes by different colors.  This 
technique allows us to distinguish one chromosome from the other 
based on the color that it stains with these dyes that are used here. 
Anyway, this is a normal cell, 46 chromosomes.  And here's a cancer 
cell.  And it's different in many ways. 

There are way too many chromosomes.  So it's a defect in 
chromosome number.  But it's also a defect in chromosome structure. 
And you can see in the boxes a couple of alterations here.  There is a 
chromosome 7, which is lacking a little bit of its end.  So it's got a 
truncation.  I think that's a seven.  Actually, maybe that's not.  Many 
that's chromosome 24.  Anyway, it doesn't matter.  And here, you can 
see, it looks like an ice cream cone: a little bit of paint on the bottom, 
a little bit of green on the top. 

This is a new kind of chromosome that has been fused by two different 
chromosomes coming together.  So this is a translocation.  And here's 
another translocation here.  So, chromosomes and cancer cells are 
often abnormal in their structure.  They can have translocations.  They 
can have deletions.  They can have other kinds of rearrangements. 
And so, based on this, we know that cancer has defects in its 
genomes, and ultimately we know in its genes. 

We also know that agents that cause cancer --

-- and we refer to these as carcinogens --

-- cancer-causing agents, carcinogens are most often mutagens --

-- agents that cause mutations.  Carcinogens are mostly mutagens. 
And therefore, it's likely that the reason they are carcinogens is 
because they lead to mutations in cellular genes. 

We believe that very strongly, and it's based on work from many 
groups over long periods of time that have established this kind of 
correlation.  To sort of prove the point, many, many agents, many, 

many things that have been suspected to be cancer-causing have been 
tested to see whether they are mutation causing, to see whether 
carcinogens are mutagens.  And they are tested using assays --

-- like carcinogenicity assays where the compound in question or the 
agent, might be a physical agent like radiation, is tested to see 
whether it will promote tumor formation.  And, this is typically done in 
laboratory animals.  So, you expose, say, a mouse or a rate to the 
agents in question, and you ask the question, over time, does that 
promote the formation of a discernible tumor? 

If yes, then the agent is a carcinogen.  OK, and then you ask the 
question, is the agent a mutagen --

-- using mutagenicity assays.  And these are typically done in bacteria 
because they can be done very, very rapidly.  We can ask whether the 
agent is able to cause mutations in bacterial cells.  And the standard 
assay that has been developed, and is still in use, is to take this agent, 
drop it into a broth carrying bacteria, and not just any bacteria, but 
bacteria that have mutation in a gene required for histidine synthesis. 

They can't make their own histidine, the amino acid histidine.  And so, 
for them to grow, they require histidine in the medium here, or in the 
medium on the plate, the auger plate that you grow them.  If you 
were to take some of these histidine minus bacteria, and plate them 
on a tissue culture plate, or rather a bacterial plate, that lacked 
histidine would any of them grow? 

No, because they can make their own.  You have been given them 
any.  So they can't grow into colonies.  You would get zero colonies if 
you did that.  This is due to a mutation in a single gene.  If you can 
create another mutation at that site and revert the abnormal gene into 
a normal gene, now the cells can make their own histidine.  So, if you 
can mutate these cells back to becoming competent to make histidine, 
then if you plate these cells on a histidine minus plate, you might get 
colonies. 

You would get some colonies.  For every bacterial cell that acquired a 
mutation at the right site, fixing the histidine synthesis gene, now that 
cell would be able to grow into a colony.  And actually, the potency of 
the mutagen determines how many colonies you get.  So, you can 
have weakly acting mutagens or strongly acting mutagens.  And, as I 
mentioned, most agents that pass this test will also pass this test, OK? 

However --

-- some known carcinogens fail that test.  They clearly are 
carcinogens.  You paint them on the back of a mouse or feed it to an 
animal: the animal will develop cancer.  And yet, when you do the 
bacterial reversion test, they don't show up as being mutagens.  Why 
is that so?  Anybody?  Yes? 

They could be so mutagenic that they block the development of the 
bacteria at all.  That's actually a very interesting idea, not what I was 
thinking of.  But it's a good idea.  They are super mutagens.  So they 
fail the test for that reason.  Anything else?  What's different between 
this test of this mutagenicity, and what actually happens in the body? 
Anybody?  Yes?  That's good.  And I'll actually come back to that. 
There is another good suggestion, but I'll come back to that answer in 
a second. 

The difference is metabolism.  Your body metabolizes things that you 
get exposed to that you eat, or that you inhale, or that you inject 
yourselves with.  It metabolizes it oftentimes to detoxify it or to make 
it more water-soluble so that you can excrete it.  There is a lot of 
metabolism breaking down or changing the things that you get 
exposed to. 

And so, it's been observed that there are certain compounds which are 
not themselves mutagens but are pro-mutagens.  They have the 
capacity to turn into mutagens.  And in the process of metabolic 
enzymes, they become mutagens.  And there are very important 
carcinogens that fall into this category.  And one of them is shown 
here.  This is a polycyclic hydrocarbon called benzoate pyrene. 

It's a very important ingredient in cigarette smoke as well as in 
barbecued beef.  It's a very potent carcinogen.  It passes this test with 
flying colors.  But if you do the bacterial reversion test, you don't see 
anything.  And the reason is that in the body, many of these double 
bonds had to be broken and replaced ultimately by hydroxyl groups to 
make this compound more water-soluble so that it can be excreted. 

And an intermediate step in the detoxification, the hydroxylation, is 
the formation of epoxide.  And these epoxides are actually highly 
reactive to DNA.  And these molecules, these intermediates, are highly 
mutagenic.  And so, when you make these in your body, thinking 
you're doing a good thing, you're actually doing a bad thing by 
creating a mutagen.  And it's this that's the mutagenic agent.  And so, 
now the simple bacterial reversion test has been replaced by 
something called the Ames test named after Bruce Ames from 
Berkeley in which the compound in question is not just given directly 
to the bacteria. 

Its first passed through an extract of the liver, usually rat liver, and it's 
in the liver where these detoxifying enzymes do their job, these 
cytochrome P450's that are referred to here are present in abundance 
in your liver. 

And so if mutagens are going to be formed, they should be formed in 
this in vitro extract.  And then, one takes the product of that and 
performs the bacterial mutation or reversion test.  OK, and now the 
things that were carcinogens but not seen to be mutagens can be seen 
to be mutagens again.  OK, but --

-- still --

There are still some truly non-mutagenic carcinogens.  And two 
examples are alcohol and asbestos. 

These do not pass any mutagenicity tests that I'm aware of.  But both 
of them are clearly linked to cancer development: alcohol in the case 
of liver, cancer, and head and neck cancer, and asbestos in the case of 
mesothelioma, the lining of the lung. 

So these are not mutagens.  So how did they promote cancer 
formation?  Based on the mechanism that was suggested over here. 
These agents cause irritation in tissues --

-- which results in tissue destruction, loss of cells --

-- and their replacement of those cells, cell replenishment.  So, it 
recruits a lot of cells to begin to divide when they normally wouldn't. 
So it results in increased proliferation, and the increased potential for 
mutation because [wind?] cells divide. 

When they duplicate their DNA, there is an inherent risk of making 
mistakes.  It's not an error-free process.  So the more cell division 
there is, the more opportunity there is for error, and therefore, the 
increased risk of acquiring mutations and becoming ultimately a 
cancer.  OK, I want to take a couple of minutes talking about one 
really important environmental carcinogen, something that we get 
exposed to. 

And that is cigarette smoke.  I mentioned that benzoate pyrene is one 
of the important ingredients in cigarette smoke, but it's actually not 
the only mutagen.  There are actually hundreds of mutagens in 
cigarette smoke.  And this is the most important environmental 
carcinogen that we have in our environments.  And it results in a large 
number of deaths per year.  Tobacco smoke is responsible for a high 
percentage of the 175,000 people who die from lung cancer in this 
country each year. 

About 150 were either smokers or former smokers. 

And the association between lung cancer and cigarette smoking is 
really striking.  If you look here, the green line represents cigarette 
consumption in males from the beginning of the century, the 1900s, 
through 1960.  And you can see it rapidly increased through 
availability and social acceptance and social trends.  Smoking was 
really rampant in the society.  And shortly thereafter, with about a 20 

year lag, you could see that lung cancer risk increased dramatically as 
well, which is directly attributable to the cigarette smoke exposure. 

It took time because cancers don't develop right away.  They develop 
over years, and so you need to get exposed to stuff over a long period 
of time.  But eventually the lung cancer started to rise.  And you could 
see the shape of the curves are virtually identical.  You can also see 
that the smoking rate has dropped off a little bit in men, and actually 
has dropped off a little bit starting about 15 to 20 years ago with 
respect to lung cancers as well. 

So smoking cessation has an effect.  If you reduce the exposure, you 
can reduce your risk.  That's true of men.  Women have not caught up 
yet.  Women started smoking later than men, about 20 years later, 
and their lung cancer rates followed, then, their increases in cigarette 
smoking with about a 20 year lag, and you can see now that lung 
cancer among women is still rising. 

And it recently passed breast cancer as the most common type of 
cancer deaths among women.  So lung cancer is a major disease and 
is directly related to smoking and smoking history.  Surprisingly, given 
that fact --

-- still 47 million Americans smoke, in recent polls something like 26% 
of men and 22% of women, a remarkably high number.  And if you go 
to other countries, the numbers are worse.  So the message clearly 
has not been adequately delivered.  But what is even more surprising 
to me was the results of a survey done in 2002 where high school 
students are asked whether they smoked. 

What do you think?  What percentage of American high school 
students smoke?  Anybody?  It was 28%; more than one in four 
smoke.  And I've heard recently that the number is increasing since 
2002. 

So, this very, very detrimental agent which one controls oneself is 
clearly not going away and will lead to, unfortunately, the deaths of 
many of these individuals because of lung cancer.  And by the way, it's 
not just lung cancer that smoking is a problem for: emphysema, heart 
disease, and other diseases as well.  I read a statistic which was really 

shocking to me.  Of that however many billions of people are present 
on the planet today, the 500 million of them will die early because of 
complications of cigarette smoking. 

500 million people will live less than their full lifespans because of 
cigarette smoke.  So, if you learn nothing else from this class, if you 
currently smoke, stop.  And if you don't smoke, don't start. 

OK, that was my little sermon.  Hopefully it had some effect.  And it 
provides a segue into --

-- the sources of the mutations that occur in genes during cancer 
progression.  We've just been discussing exogenous, or environmental 
mutagens, cigarette smoke being one, some lead exposure being 
another, dietary carcinogens I mentioned, environmental pollutants 
like the dyes in the ponds and ash land.  They are common.  They do 
certainly have an effect, but there are probably somewhat overblown 
except for some light and tobacco smoke, and then these rare 
instances of high exposure to very, very toxic things. 

A more common problem are replication errors, mistakes that your 
cells make in duplicating their DNA.  They put in the wrong base or 
they skip a base, or other errors take place during DNA duplication. 

Your DNA can break inside of your cells as it gets moved around from 
place to place or because of an exposure to certain things from the 
outside.  And then this can lead to translocations or deletions or other 
rearrangements.  And I'll tell you later about how those can lead to 
cancer-causing mutations. 

Defects in chromosome segregation, dividing the number of 
chromosomes properly between cells, is another problem.  And I 
shown you an example of that.  Here you can see that the number of 
chromosomes is also wrong in addition to their structure.  So, defects 
in chromosome segregation are a problem in cancer.  Defects in DNA 
repair processes can then facilitate further mutations. 

And various metabolic processes can produce mutagens insider cells 
like super oxide molecules which are very reactive and very 
mutagenic. 

Your cells have ways of detoxifying, but they're not always perfect. 
You can also take antioxidants to try to reduce your risk of getting this 
kind of exposure.  But nevertheless, these endogenously produced 
mutagens are another common source of mutations in cancer.  So, we 
get exposed to things.  We produce things, we make mistakes, and in 
our cells, alterations occur in cellular genes which drive this process 
forward. 

And overall, therefore, we observe a clonal evolution of more and 
more abnormal cells in the development of cancer.  And that's 
captured here.  Clonal evolution from a normal cell, a cell that acquires 
a single mutation, this cell now has increased capacity to divide.  So it 
divides more.  More of its progeny are produced.  We are maybe in the 
stage of hyperplasia here.  And within this increased mass of cells, 
another mutation occurs. 

Now the cell has even greater capacity to divide or begin to act 
abnormally relative to its neighbors.  It begins to grow.  And within 
this increased collection of cells, yet another mutation occurs.  There is 
a clonal evolution of more and more abnormal cells.  And we know 
that cancers, in fact, have acquired many, many changes in their DNA 
as evidenced by the chromosomes, but also as evidenced by our 
knowledge of the sequence of key genes that are affected in cancer. 

Now, as we'll discuss, many of these genes affect proliferation --

-- and cell death.  Again, cancer is a disease of cell number, too many 
cells.  And this process is normally very carefully balanced inside of 
your bodies inside of your tissues.  There is an equal balance between 
proliferation --

-- and cell death so that in normal homeostasis --

-- you have the appropriate members of cells produced as die off, and 
so that ultimately you are in balance.  But in cancer, the balance is 
shifted.  It's shifted in the direction of proliferation, and away from cell 
death.  And the consequences of that are that you've now produced 
too many cells for the tissue, too many cells in the gut, too many cells 
in the blood.  And these cells, then, accumulate and acquire additional 
changes that imbue them with those qualities that advanced 
malignancies have. 

Increased proliferation is one thing, but importantly it's not the only 
thing.  Increased proliferation and cell death are important qualities for 
sure.  But also as I mentioned, cancer cells develop in other ways that 
are important in the development of malignancies.  Today, for 
example, a recruit a blood supply.  They secrete factors that cause the 
blood vessels to grow into them, to feed the tumor. 

They increased their motility.  Cancer cells move around.  They move 
into tissue.  They move into the bloodstream.  They move back out 
again.  And that's what this intravasation term means, moving into the 
blood supply, and other characteristics as well, how they remodel the 
extracellular matrix, or how they avoid the immune system, all sorts of 
things that cancer cells require in order to survive to get bigger, to 
thrive, are acquired through alterations in cellular genes. 

Now, the final thing, and I'll close with this and pick it up again next 
time, the final thing that convinces us that cancer is a disease of your 
genes is that we've now sequenced the genes of cancer cells and have 
found alterations.  Like in this gene here that you've been exposed to, 
the [RAS] gene, in which in normal cells we see one sequence and in 
cancer cells we see a different sequence, and we can understand that 
as a change in the activity of this important signaling protein that 
causes cells to divide inappropriately.  And I'll stop there.
