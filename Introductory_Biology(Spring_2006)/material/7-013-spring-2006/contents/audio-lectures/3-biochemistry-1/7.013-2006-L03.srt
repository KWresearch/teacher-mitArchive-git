1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:22
OK.  So the thing that we're going
to talk today about are

2
00:00:22 --> 00:00:30
macromolecules.  And often
these are polymers.

3
00:00:30 --> 00:00:37
Now, all macromolecules comprise of
multiple carbons joined together in

4
00:00:37 --> 00:00:44
some way.  But the real definition
of a polymer is that there is some

5
00:00:44 --> 00:00:51
kind of monomer that is joined
together in a repeated way to make

6
00:00:51 --> 00:00:59
some kind of multimer that forms the
polymer.  OK.

7
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
Now, integral to understanding all
of this is the notion of chemical

8
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
bonds.  And you're going to,
in this week's Section you're going

9
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
to be addressing,
remembering, understanding what

10
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
chemical bonds are.
And here are some concepts that are

11
00:01:16 --> 00:01:21
essential that you understand for
chemical bonds.

12
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
Let me list them on the board.
And then we'll go through them in

13
00:01:25 --> 00:01:30
some more detail.  And then
I'm going to move on.

14
00:01:30 --> 00:01:35
And you are going to deal with this
more in Section,

15
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
but this is really integral to
understanding the rest of the course.

16
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
So one of the terms you need to
know is electronegativity.

17
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
Anyone want to give me an
electronegativity definition?

18
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
I may be able to find another
chocolate fish for an

19
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
electronegativity definition.
Where?  A little hand.

20
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
Yeah?  Say it again.  OK.
Good.  Yeah.  How strongly an atom

21
00:02:07 --> 00:02:13
attracts electrons.
This is good.  You see,

22
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
you get to practice catching and I
get to practice throwing.

23
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
So the relative affinity of a
particular atom for electrons.

24
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
OK?  So that's one think you need
to know.  Valance.

25
00:02:29 --> 00:02:34
Super important.
Valance.  Yeah?

26
00:02:34 --> 00:02:40
How many electron slots available
for connections.

27
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
Try to rephrase.
Yes, but rephrase it a bit.

28
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
We're talking about chemical bonds.
So?  OK, how many bonds.  I did not

29
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
give that away.
OK.  How many bonds a molecule can,

30
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
an atom can make.
OK?  OK.  And then we get into the

31
00:03:03 --> 00:03:11
bonds per se.  And I'm going to list
them here.  I'm going to list them

32
00:03:11 --> 00:03:19
in order from strong to weak.
Covalent bonds.  Ionic.  I'll go

33
00:03:19 --> 00:03:29
through some slides in a moment.

34
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
Hydrogen and something I'll call
hydrophobic.  OK.

35
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
And covalent bonds are the
strongest and these so-called

36
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
hydrophobic bonds are the weakest
bonds.  Ones that we are

37
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
particularly interested in,
actually, we're interested in all of

38
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
them, but I would say covalent,
hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds are

39
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
particularly important.
And you will see when we talk about

40
00:03:56 --> 00:04:01
DNA, hydrogen bonds are
very important.

41
00:04:01 --> 00:04:07
So let's go through some pictures.
This is a table from your book, I'm

42
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
not going to dwell on too much,
but you really need to be familiar

43
00:04:13 --> 00:04:20
with this, you need to understand
what is in this.

44
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
And it will indicate for you what
the nature of the different

45
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
bonds are.  OK.
Covalent bonds,

46
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
really, the two atoms become very
closely joined together.

47
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
And, again, you're going to deal
with this.  Let me just move onto,

48
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
in your recitation.  Let me deal
with two things that I want to dwell

49
00:04:44 --> 00:04:49
on a little bit.
The first is the notion of polar

50
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
and nonpolar molecules.
OK?  So polar molecules have got

51
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
differential charge distribution.
All right?  So we can add that

52
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
actually to our list.
If you want to go back and add

53
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
something to your list,
its part and parcel of the notion of

54
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
electronegativity,
but let's also write polar versus

55
00:05:11 --> 00:05:16
nonpolar molecules.
In a polar molecule,

56
00:05:16 --> 00:05:21
the charges in the molecule are
asymmetrically distributed.

57
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
Whereas, in the nonpolar molecule
the charges are uniformly

58
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
distributed and there is no net
asymmetry of charge in that

59
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
particular molecule.
And that will become important in a

60
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
little bit.  Here is one that,
again, you will dwell on in Section

61
00:05:40 --> 00:05:44
but I will introduce now.
Hydrogen bonds are between a

62
00:05:44 --> 00:05:49
hydrogen and an oxygen,
and the hydrogen or something else,

63
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
something that is more
electronegative,

64
00:05:54 --> 00:05:59
the hydrogen, it's the hydrogen,
this is not a covalent bond.

65
00:05:59 --> 00:06:05
And the hydrogen interaction is
integral to the structure of DNA,

66
00:06:05 --> 00:06:11
as we will discuss in this lecture
and when we talk about molecular

67
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
biology.  OK.  So that is a very
cursory introduction to something

68
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
that you will be dwelling on more in
Section this week.

69
00:06:23 --> 00:06:30
OK.  So I want to talk now about
polymers.

70
00:06:30 --> 00:06:36
And I want to talk how they form
biologically.  And I'm going to tell

71
00:06:36 --> 00:06:43
you about two types of reactions
that you should understand.

72
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
Condensation reaction which forms a
polymer and a hydrolysis reaction

73
00:06:49 --> 00:07:06
which breaks a polymer.

74
00:07:06 --> 00:07:12
So let's look at a diagram here that
I've taken from your book.

75
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
Here are two monomers.  And you can
see there is a hydroxyl group and a

76
00:07:18 --> 00:07:24
hydrogen group and a hydrogen.
And those two things react with one

77
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
another and, with the use of energy,
water is released, and the two

78
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
monomers are joined to one another.
OK?  Again, you're going to have

79
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
plenty of practice at this.
Don't try to draw this diagram here.

80
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
OK?  You can,
we'll deal with it in a little bit.

81
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
Just look at it and understand what
I'm saying at the time and it really

82
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
is sufficient.
So, here, you've got the exclusion

83
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
of water, the use of energy to get
two monomers joined up,

84
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
and then the process continues and
you get a polymer being built up of

85
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
more and more monomers.
Now, the converse of that is

86
00:08:03 --> 00:08:09
hydrolysis where you add water and
also use energy to break up a

87
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
polymer and release a monomer.
So either hydrolysis reaction or a

88
00:08:15 --> 00:08:21
condensation reaction are energy
requiring reactions.

89
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
And this energy has to come from
somewhere.  And we will spend a

90
00:08:27 --> 00:08:34
lecture talking about where the
energy comes from.

91
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
So I want to draw the analogy,
and it may seem hokey to you, but

92
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
it's actually quite useful,
a useful way for me to think about

93
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
this, so I want to share it with you.
I want to draw the analogy to the

94
00:08:47 --> 00:08:52
cell as a factory.
And I want to begin by talking

95
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
about the materials that the factory
uses to synthesize whatever it is

96
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
it's going to synthesize.
And then as we move through the

97
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
biochemistry section I'll talk about
the machinery within the cell that

98
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
makes the synthesis take place.
So we're going to talk about the

99
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
materials that are present in the
cell.  And particularly we're going

100
00:09:14 --> 00:09:19
to talk about four groups of
macromolecules,

101
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
the big four from which everything
else is built and that really are

102
00:09:23 --> 00:09:28
pivotal for life.  These
are proteins.

103
00:09:28 --> 00:09:33
And, actually,
let me not list them in that order.

104
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
Let me list them in the order in
which I'm going to talk about them.

105
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
I'm going to talk about lipids,
carbohydrates,

106
00:09:43 --> 00:09:49
nucleic acids.  And I'll talk about
those three today.

107
00:09:49 --> 00:09:54
And then next time I'll talk about
proteins.  So if you look at the dry

108
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
mass of a cell it's
very interesting.

109
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
Lipids comprise about 5% of the dry
mass, carbohydrates about 25%,

110
00:10:06 --> 00:10:13
nucleic acids 10%, and proteins
about 55%.  OK.

111
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
So that's what we're going to be
talking about,

112
00:10:19 --> 00:10:26
these four groups of macromolecules
that make up the components

113
00:10:26 --> 00:10:33
of the cell.
Now, two things that I want to point

114
00:10:33 --> 00:10:40
out as we talk about these
macromolecules is that very often in

115
00:10:40 --> 00:10:47
biology the polymers have two
properties that are very important.

116
00:10:47 --> 00:10:54
One, they have polarity.  That
means one end is different from the

117
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
other end.  OK?
And the other thing that they very

118
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05
often have, not always but some
classes in particular,

119
00:11:05 --> 00:11:10
is a linear order.  OK?
So that's, both of those properties,

120
00:11:10 --> 00:11:15
if you give this a moment's thought,
you will see are very similar to

121
00:11:15 --> 00:11:20
sentences.  There's a beginning and
an end of a sentence,

122
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
and within a sentence the words come
in a particular order.

123
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
And that gives you an information
content.  That gives you a way to

124
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
carry out or to store information.
So I'll point this out.

125
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
This is particularly true for the
proteins and the nucleic acids.

126
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
It's also somewhat true for
carbohydrates and less so for lipids.

127
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
So these two properties of
biological polymers are fascinating

128
00:11:50 --> 00:11:55
and they are crucial for life to
proceed.  All right.

129
00:11:55 --> 00:12:00
So let's move onto one of the big
four.  Lipids.

130
00:12:00 --> 00:12:05
Lipids.  So lipids are a somewhat
large and almost amorphous group of

131
00:12:05 --> 00:12:11
molecules in that I cannot give you
a chemical formula,

132
00:12:11 --> 00:12:17
really, to say this is definitely a
lipid and this is not a lipid.

133
00:12:17 --> 00:12:23
They have one property that is
crucial for defining them as lipids,

134
00:12:23 --> 00:12:29
and this is that they are
hydrophobic --

135
00:12:29 --> 00:12:37
-- or nonpolar.

136
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
And this property of being
hydrophobic, so lipids in foods.

137
00:12:41 --> 00:12:45
What are the lipids just, you know,
in your food pyramid?  It's just to

138
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
make sure we're all talking about
the same stuff here.

139
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
Fats and oils, right.
Yes.  And you can come and get a

140
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
fish later.  OK.
So fats and oils.

141
00:12:57 --> 00:13:02
They're used for a couple of things.
One of the things about fats and

142
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
oils is that they store a lot of
energy.  So they serve as a

143
00:13:07 --> 00:13:12
long-term energy source for the cell.
And the other thing they do really

144
00:13:12 --> 00:13:18
has to do with their insulation
properties.  And their insulation

145
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
properties fall into multiple
categories.  The most important one

146
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
we touched on last time when we
talked about the components

147
00:13:28 --> 00:13:33
of a cell.
We talked about the fact that the

148
00:13:33 --> 00:13:38
cell is a cell,
and the organelles in the cell are

149
00:13:38 --> 00:13:43
organelles because they are membrane
bound.  And I threw out at you the

150
00:13:43 --> 00:13:48
term lipid bilayer,
and I'll throw it out at you again

151
00:13:48 --> 00:13:53
in a moment.  This is something made
of lipids that insulates the cell

152
00:13:53 --> 00:13:58
from its environment or subcellular
compartments from one another.

153
00:13:58 --> 00:14:04
So part of the insulation property
are membranes.

154
00:14:04 --> 00:14:09
And, again, this term,
I'll write on the board this time,

155
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
lipid bilayer.  And the other aspect
of insulation or the more classical

156
00:14:15 --> 00:14:21
things you think about,
you don't get cold because you've

157
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
got a layer of fat under your skin,
and that stops yourself from losing

158
00:14:27 --> 00:14:32
heat.  So heat loss.
And, for example,

159
00:14:32 --> 00:14:37
birds use lipids to waterproof their
feathers so that they can stand in

160
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
the rain and not get wet.
OK.  Another aspect that I'll throw

161
00:14:41 --> 00:14:46
out at you also here is that lipids
also make things called hormones,

162
00:14:46 --> 00:14:51
which are substances that control
various aspects of body function.

163
00:14:51 --> 00:14:55
I'll have a little more to say
about them in a couple of minutes,

164
00:14:55 --> 00:15:00
and then will have quite a bit more
to say about them when we talk about

165
00:15:00 --> 00:15:05
reproduction.
So let me see what is next here.

166
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
OK.  So let's talk about some
typical lipids and some examples of

167
00:15:11 --> 00:15:16
lipids.  This is a diagram from your
book, so you can go and look at it

168
00:15:16 --> 00:15:22
at your leisure,
of a triglyceride.

169
00:15:22 --> 00:15:28
Now, what I want you to take from
this is that, so triglycerides,

170
00:15:28 --> 00:15:34
tri meaning three.
And the glyce- part is from glycerol,

171
00:15:34 --> 00:15:40
which is this molecule up here,
onto which three long carbon chains

172
00:15:40 --> 00:15:47
are added.  And these long carbon
chains are called fatty acids.

173
00:15:47 --> 00:15:53
And that's important to know.  So a
triglycerides is glycerol onto which

174
00:15:53 --> 00:16:00
three fatty acid chains
have been added.

175
00:16:00 --> 00:16:07
And it's the fatty acid chains that
are hydrophobic.

176
00:16:07 --> 00:16:15
So triglycerides are a very common

177
00:16:15 --> 00:16:21
type of lipid.
Now, after I just told you,

178
00:16:21 --> 00:16:28
ah, it's fixed.  After I just told
you that lipids were

179
00:16:28 --> 00:16:35
all hydrophobic.
I'm now going to tell you that some

180
00:16:35 --> 00:16:42
lipids are amphipathic.
And they're amphipathic,

181
00:16:42 --> 00:16:49
so amphipathic means that they have
both polar plus nonpolar components.

182
00:16:49 --> 00:16:56
And one of the most important
amphipathic molecules in the lipid

183
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
field is a phospholipid.
So this is a molecule that's got

184
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
these fatty acid long carbon chains
on one end and on the other end has

185
00:17:08 --> 00:17:14
got a very polar phosphate group.
OK?  And here's phosphate with

186
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
something called choline added onto
it.  So this is phosphatidylcholine.

187
00:17:20 --> 00:17:26
And phospholipids, and I spelt
amphipathic incorrectly.

188
00:17:26 --> 00:17:32
Phospholipids are essential for
formation of the lipid bilayer

189
00:17:32 --> 00:17:38
membranes.  And the reason they are
is because of this dual charged and

190
00:17:38 --> 00:17:44
noncharged portion.
So here is a diagram that I showed

191
00:17:44 --> 00:17:50
you last time that was not as well
labeled.  This is a diagram of a

192
00:17:50 --> 00:17:56
lipid bilayer,
so one of the membranes that

193
00:17:56 --> 00:18:02
surrounds your cells and
your organelles.

194
00:18:02 --> 00:18:07
Facing out onto the water of the
cell are the hydrophilic heads of

195
00:18:07 --> 00:18:12
this phospholipids,
the charged heads.  And then facing

196
00:18:12 --> 00:18:17
one another are two rows,
OK, of these hydrophobic fatty acid

197
00:18:17 --> 00:18:22
tails.  So the bilayer is because
you have one layer of these

198
00:18:22 --> 00:18:27
molecules with the hydrophilic heads
facing the water,

199
00:18:27 --> 00:18:32
the hydrophobic tails pointing in.
And those interact with another

200
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
layer where the hydrophilic heads
are pointing to the water and the

201
00:18:36 --> 00:18:40
hydrophobic tails are pointing
inwards.  The hydrophobic tails

202
00:18:40 --> 00:18:45
interact with one another and you
get this very stable lipid bilayer.

203
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
OK.  It's very cool.  That's how
things work, and they work very

204
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
easily.  And you can get them to be
synthesized in a test-tube very

205
00:18:53 --> 00:18:58
easily.  Here is another one.
Saturated versus unsaturated fats.

206
00:18:58 --> 00:19:08
Unsat, OK, as an unsaturated.

207
00:19:08 --> 00:19:14
In saturated fats, the fatty acid
side chain contains no double bounds.

208
00:19:14 --> 00:19:20
OK?  So it saturated four hydrogens.
In unsaturated fats, there are some

209
00:19:20 --> 00:19:26
double bonds that would allow one to
add more hydrogens if they

210
00:19:26 --> 00:19:32
were broken.  OK?
So saturated versus unsaturated fats.

211
00:19:32 --> 00:19:38
So saturated fats are the things
you find in butter and in hard fats.

212
00:19:38 --> 00:19:44
And they're supposed to be bad for
you.  OK?  So saturated fats have

213
00:19:44 --> 00:19:50
been implicated in raising something
called low density lipoproteins

214
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
which are involved in various
aspects of cell function that are

215
00:19:56 --> 00:20:03
believed to lead to heart disease.
But it turns out that there's more

216
00:20:03 --> 00:20:09
to it than that.
So if you've ever been really bored

217
00:20:09 --> 00:20:15
and you've read the ingredients on
the box of cookies that you've eaten,

218
00:20:15 --> 00:20:21
you may see something that says
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.

219
00:20:21 --> 00:20:27
Yeah?  OK.  Now,
your vegetable oil is rather

220
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
unsaturated.  OK?
It's got a lot of double bonds.

221
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
And one of the reasons that it is
liquid is because these double bonds

222
00:20:37 --> 00:20:42
are there and you don't get the
chains of the lipid packing very

223
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
tightly and it's a liquid.
But you can take your vegetable oil

224
00:20:46 --> 00:20:51
with lots of unsaturated bonds and
you can partially saturate it.

225
00:20:51 --> 00:20:56
And you can get out of that two
kinds of partially saturated fat,

226
00:20:56 --> 00:21:01
partially hydrogenated fat.
You can get this stuff called

227
00:21:01 --> 00:21:05
transunsaturated fat.
Now, if you look at this diagram,

228
00:21:05 --> 00:21:10
you will see these fatty acid side
chains are in nice order here.

229
00:21:10 --> 00:21:14
OK?  And they are because the
hydrogens that are across from the

230
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
double bonds are intrans from one
another.  They're kind of diagonally

231
00:21:18 --> 00:21:23
opposite from one another.
And what that does is to allow

232
00:21:23 --> 00:21:27
these side chains to pack very
tightly, and you get a very

233
00:21:27 --> 00:21:32
hard fat that way.
Somehow this partially hydrogenated

234
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
stuff is very bad for you.
It raises your LDL, it reduces this

235
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
stuff called high density
lipoprotein, which is good for you,

236
00:21:40 --> 00:21:44
and it increases your heart disease
risk.  Interestingly,

237
00:21:44 --> 00:21:48
you do not find these types of
molecules in nature.

238
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
You only find them when you
hydrogenate your vegetable oil and

239
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
make your margarine or make the
stuff that McDonald's cooks its

240
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
French fries in, OK, and
its chicken nuggets.

241
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
So a couple of years ago there was
so much issue about this that

242
00:22:04 --> 00:22:09
McDonald's pledged to find a
different vegetable oil in which to

243
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
fry its fries.
And it's still searching,

244
00:22:13 --> 00:22:18
apparently, because there's some
issue with taste being compromised

245
00:22:18 --> 00:22:22
as you go to healthier fats.
OK.  Now, in contrast to the

246
00:22:22 --> 00:22:27
transunsaturated fats there's this
sysunsaturated fat also.

247
00:22:27 --> 00:22:30
And if you look here,
you can see that these side chains

248
00:22:30 --> 00:22:34
are kinked.  And the reason they're
kinked is that the hydrogens across

249
00:22:34 --> 00:22:38
the double bond are on the same side
of the molecule as one another.

250
00:22:38 --> 00:22:42
That has the effect of not allowing
the side chains to pack tightly.

251
00:22:42 --> 00:22:46
So you get side chains floating all
over the place,

252
00:22:46 --> 00:22:50
and that changes the energy of the
fat so that it is a liquid rather

253
00:22:50 --> 00:22:54
than a solid.  And these are much
better for you,

254
00:22:54 --> 00:22:58
these sysunsaturated fats.
And you find them in lots of

255
00:22:58 --> 00:23:03
vegetable oils and vegetable fats.
OK.  Here's another one.

256
00:23:03 --> 00:23:10
Here's our joke for the day.
OK.  Steroids.  Steroids are a

257
00:23:10 --> 00:23:17
lipid.  They are derived from,
OK, so let me just say for this

258
00:23:17 --> 00:23:24
unsaturated.  I mentioned sys and
transunsaturated fats.

259
00:23:24 --> 00:23:32
I'm going to mention steroid
hormones.

260
00:23:32 --> 00:23:35
There are a few of them.
Steroids are not all hormones,

261
00:23:35 --> 00:23:38
although cholesterol, we don't think
of cholesterol as a hormone,

262
00:23:38 --> 00:23:42
although, actually, I think it
really is.  Vitamin D is a vitamin

263
00:23:42 --> 00:23:45
that works together with other
molecules.  Cortisol and

264
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
testosterone are classically thought
of as hormones.

265
00:23:49 --> 00:23:52
Very small amounts of them will
change body function in profound

266
00:23:52 --> 00:23:56
ways.  And we'll have more to say
about testosterone later

267
00:23:56 --> 00:24:00
on in the course.
The androgens that lead to people

268
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
who have large green muscles are a
class that are related to

269
00:24:05 --> 00:24:11
testosterone, androsterone and so on,
but they're all the structures with

270
00:24:11 --> 00:24:16
these four rings in this
characteristic way are all

271
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
characteristic of a steroid.
All right.  So that is all I have

272
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
to say about lipids.
Let's move onto either number two

273
00:24:27 --> 00:24:34
here, carbohydrates.
So carbohydrates have as their --

274
00:24:34 --> 00:24:45
OK.  Carbohydrates.

275
00:24:45 --> 00:24:52
Also classically known as sugars.

276
00:24:52 --> 00:24:57
And because of that there are a
couple of functions of carbohydrates.

277
00:24:57 --> 00:25:02
They are the major source of
short-term energy.

278
00:25:02 --> 00:25:07
If you need short-term energy you
use carbohydrates.

279
00:25:07 --> 00:25:12
They're also a carbon source,
so we'll talk extensively about

280
00:25:12 --> 00:25:17
building up molecules.
And you need carbons to do that.

281
00:25:17 --> 00:25:22
Carbohydrates serve as a carbon
source for building other molecules.

282
00:25:22 --> 00:25:27
And, as I'll mention briefly, they
also can convey information.

283
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
Carbohydrates have,
as their chemical principle,

284
00:25:31 --> 00:25:35
so we can find a chemical principle
that unifies them,

285
00:25:35 --> 00:25:40
they all contain carbons that are
joined to a hydrogen and to a

286
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
hydroxyl, and obviously to other
things as well.

287
00:25:44 --> 00:25:49
So you can loosely give
carbohydrates the formula of CH2O to

288
00:25:49 --> 00:25:53
the N.  Now, the monomer,
now we can actually, with lipids

289
00:25:53 --> 00:25:57
it's very hard to talk about a
monomer and a polymer.  In

290
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
carbohydrates one can.
And one can talk about the monomer,

291
00:26:02 --> 00:26:08
which is called a monosaccharide
which polymerizes to form a

292
00:26:08 --> 00:26:14
polysaccharide.
And they do so.

293
00:26:14 --> 00:26:19
One can also get,
let me just write it here,

294
00:26:19 --> 00:26:25
one can also get disaccharides where
disaccharides are two and

295
00:26:25 --> 00:26:31
polysaccharides are really
more than two.

296
00:26:31 --> 00:26:36
They're usually more than ten or so,
but for our purposes more than two

297
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
is fine.  OK.  So in order to form a
polymer of carbohydrates,

298
00:26:42 --> 00:26:48
one forms a glycosidic linkage or
glycosidic bond.

299
00:26:48 --> 00:26:54
So it's a covalent bond where one
has --

300
00:26:54 --> 00:27:09
Two carbohydrates or two

301
00:27:09 --> 00:27:17
monosaccharides interacting with one
another through a condensation

302
00:27:17 --> 00:27:26
reaction, classical condensation
reaction with the elimination of

303
00:27:26 --> 00:27:35
water to give you, excuse
me, yeah, no.

304
00:27:35 --> 00:27:40
I wrote this down incorrectly in my
notes.  Apologies.

305
00:27:40 --> 00:27:46
OK.  To give you a glycosidic
linkage.  OK?  So this is a

306
00:27:46 --> 00:27:51
classical condensation reaction.
Now, polysaccharides or

307
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
carbohydrates are interesting.
They can either be rings or they

308
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
can be linear.
And they can also be modified.

309
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
So like the lipids where you could
get phospholipids,

310
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
carbohydrates can have various extra
things added onto them that changes

311
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
their properties.
Let's take a look at a few of them.

312
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
Here are some monosaccharides.  And
the ones that are super important

313
00:28:17 --> 00:28:21
for you to know are these two down
here.  OK?  And you should know the

314
00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
structures of these.
This is ribose and deoxyribose.

315
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
And the reason for this will become
clear when I move onto the next

316
00:28:29 --> 00:28:33
class of macromolecules,
DNA and RNA, because those sugars

317
00:28:33 --> 00:28:37
are part of DNA and RNA.
OK?  So these ribose and deoxyribose

318
00:28:37 --> 00:28:42
are five carbon rings.
You can see they're not quite a

319
00:28:42 --> 00:28:47
five, they're not a five carbon ring.
They are five carbon sugars.

320
00:28:47 --> 00:28:52
And this is an isomer of one of the
forms that this five carbon sugar

321
00:28:52 --> 00:28:57
can take.  OK.
So some of you may be lactose

322
00:28:57 --> 00:29:02
intolerant and might not be able,
in fact, to enjoy digging in and

323
00:29:02 --> 00:29:07
enjoying a bowl of creamy
delicious ice cream.

324
00:29:07 --> 00:29:11
So, in fact, the reason,
I didn't make that up, though the

325
00:29:11 --> 00:29:15
reason you cannot is because you
need a specific protein,

326
00:29:15 --> 00:29:19
a specific enzyme that we'll talk
about, not the specific enzyme,

327
00:29:19 --> 00:29:23
but we'll talk about the notion of
enzymes in a couple of lectures that

328
00:29:23 --> 00:29:28
breaks a bond between the
disaccharide that is lactose.

329
00:29:28 --> 00:29:33
So lactose is a disaccharide that is
a galactose joined together with a

330
00:29:33 --> 00:29:38
glucose.  OK.  So these are six
carbon sugars.

331
00:29:38 --> 00:29:43
And there's a bond between the two
of them that you have to break in

332
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
order to digest the lactose from
milk.  And if you cannot then this

333
00:29:49 --> 00:29:54
lactose causes you digestive issues.
Here on the top is sucrose which is

334
00:29:54 --> 00:30:00
a dimer, a disaccharide,
a glucose joined to a fructose.

335
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
OK.  So here's an interesting
question.  I don't know when you

336
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
were little, but when I was little I
used to try and eat grass.

337
00:30:09 --> 00:30:13
And, clearly, that doesn't work
very well.  Humans cannot eat grass.

338
00:30:13 --> 00:30:18
Whereas, cows and many animals can
survive just very well on a diet of

339
00:30:18 --> 00:30:22
just plants.  And that is because we
cannot deal with this carbohydrate

340
00:30:22 --> 00:30:27
in plants called cellulose.
Now, interestingly,

341
00:30:27 --> 00:30:31
we can digest other plant
carbohydrates,

342
00:30:31 --> 00:30:36
particularly starch or amylose which
is what most of the carbohydrates

343
00:30:36 --> 00:30:41
that we eat come from.
The reason for this is interesting,

344
00:30:41 --> 00:30:45
and it has to do with these
glycosidic linkages.

345
00:30:45 --> 00:30:50
OK.  So here we have a linkage
between glucose,

346
00:30:50 --> 00:30:55
two glucoses that give something
called maltose.

347
00:30:55 --> 00:30:59
And maltose is part of the starch
carbohydrate, or the amylose

348
00:30:59 --> 00:31:04
carbohydrates.
And what you should know here about

349
00:31:04 --> 00:31:09
these chains, these circles,
and you should remember from old

350
00:31:09 --> 00:31:14
chemistry as if there is a bold part
in the front of this ring then it is

351
00:31:14 --> 00:31:18
coming out of the board towards you.
OK.  So here you have these two

352
00:31:18 --> 00:31:23
glucoses linked such that a bond
joining them is coming out of the

353
00:31:23 --> 00:31:28
board towards you.
Now, conversely,

354
00:31:28 --> 00:31:33
and this is called an alpha 1,
4 bond where the bonds coming out of

355
00:31:33 --> 00:31:38
the board towards you in cellobiose,
which is a precursor for cellulose,

356
00:31:38 --> 00:31:43
the grass carbohydrate,
the bond goes back, OK, back away

357
00:31:43 --> 00:31:48
from the rings.
And that's called a beta 1,

358
00:31:48 --> 00:31:53
4 linkage.  And we can break this
alpha 1, 4 linkage but not this beta

359
00:31:53 --> 00:31:59
1, 4 linkage.  And I'll come back to
this when we talk about enzymes.

360
00:31:59 --> 00:32:03
We do not have the correct enzymes
to do so.  And finally with respect

361
00:32:03 --> 00:32:07
to carbohydrates,
I mentioned that they were sources

362
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
of information.
One of the interesting sources of

363
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
information from carbohydrates is in
your blood cells.

364
00:32:15 --> 00:32:19
So your blood group is as a result
of adding specific chains of

365
00:32:19 --> 00:32:23
specific carbohydrates,
specific monosaccharides,

366
00:32:23 --> 00:32:27
and a whole bunch of them,
onto particular red blood cell

367
00:32:27 --> 00:32:32
surface proteins.
So if you're an A blood group,

368
00:32:32 --> 00:32:37
you have a series of specific
carbohydrates added on in order to

369
00:32:37 --> 00:32:42
one of these cell surface proteins.
If you're a B blood group, you also

370
00:32:42 --> 00:32:46
have this carbohydrate chain but the
specific carbohydrates,

371
00:32:46 --> 00:32:51
the specific monosaccharides are
different.  All right.

372
00:32:51 --> 00:32:56
So let's move onto the reason that
you're all really sitting here.

373
00:32:56 --> 00:33:01
So, really, the reason that you're
all sitting here is because of this

374
00:33:01 --> 00:33:05
next group of macromolecules.
And I don't mean that that's the

375
00:33:05 --> 00:33:09
reason, you know,
you're alive, that you exist in life.

376
00:33:09 --> 00:33:12
I mean that's the reason you're
talking 7.013.

377
00:33:12 --> 00:33:16
Because nucleic acids are the thing
that have, and the understanding of

378
00:33:16 --> 00:33:20
nucleic acids is what has
revolutionized biology so that --

379
00:33:20 --> 00:33:28
So that everyone in every discipline

380
00:33:28 --> 00:33:33
at MIT has some association,
has some way of using the

381
00:33:33 --> 00:33:39
information from nucleic acids to
their advantage and in their careers.

382
00:33:39 --> 00:33:44
OK.  So nucleic acids,
as I'll discuss, do serve as an

383
00:33:44 --> 00:33:49
energy source or as a way of storing
energy, but most important is their

384
00:33:49 --> 00:33:54
function, and that's a super
important function.

385
00:33:54 --> 00:34:00
But the reason you're talking 7.
13 is not because of that.

386
00:34:00 --> 00:34:07
The reason you are is because of the
information content that nucleic

387
00:34:07 --> 00:34:14
acids are able to carry and to
perpetuate from one generation to

388
00:34:14 --> 00:34:21
another.  So, really,
what they are involved in is

389
00:34:21 --> 00:34:29
information storage and
transfer.  All right.

390
00:34:29 --> 00:34:35
So, again, as for carbohydrates,
we can talk about monomers and we

391
00:34:35 --> 00:34:41
can talk about polymers.
The monomers for nucleic acids is a

392
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
nucleotide.  Oh,
OK.  Enough air play.

393
00:34:47 --> 00:34:53
Watson and Crick get a lot of air
play, so that's enough.

394
00:34:53 --> 00:35:00
You can go and look at their
picture at your leisure.  OK.

395
00:35:00 --> 00:35:03
So I've taken this from your book
and I'm going to draw some stuff on

396
00:35:03 --> 00:35:07
the board.  I want to point out that
in the new edition of your book,

397
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
you will find there is a mistake in
the structure of your nucleotides.

398
00:35:11 --> 00:35:15
That was true in the last edition.
I wrote to the senior author.  I

399
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
said there is a problem with the
sugar structure in the nucleic acids.

400
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
Would you please change it for the
next edition?  And he said

401
00:35:23 --> 00:35:27
absolutely we will.
And the new edition came out and

402
00:35:27 --> 00:35:30
there we are.  OK?
So we'll have to,

403
00:35:30 --> 00:35:34
so we're going to deal with that,
but I think we'll get you all free

404
00:35:34 --> 00:35:38
copies, or your successors free
copies of the next edition of the

405
00:35:38 --> 00:35:42
book or something to make up for
this.  But, actually,

406
00:35:42 --> 00:35:46
it's a good exercise for you because
you can learn the proper structure

407
00:35:46 --> 00:35:50
of the sugar.  So what is a
nucleotide?  OK.

408
00:35:50 --> 00:35:54
A nucleotide, as you gather,
has a sugar associated with it.

409
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
It has, the sugar it has associated
it with is either ribose

410
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
or deoxyribose.
This sugar is joined to a phosphate

411
00:36:02 --> 00:36:07
group.  And the sugar is also joined
to something called a base.

412
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
Now, the sugar is a five carbon
ring.  I'll come back to this slide

413
00:36:12 --> 00:36:17
in a moment and we'll talk about the
bottom part of it.

414
00:36:17 --> 00:36:22
The sugar is a five carbon ring.
OK?  Here it is.  It's actually a

415
00:36:22 --> 00:36:27
four carbon ring with an oxygen and
there's another carbon

416
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
sticking out.
And what they've done in your book

417
00:36:32 --> 00:36:36
is to forget about this carbon up
here and turn this oxygen here into

418
00:36:36 --> 00:36:40
a carbon.  So it's kind of weird.
Later in the book the structure is

419
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
correct, but you should bear this in
mind.  I've pointed this out in your

420
00:36:44 --> 00:36:49
PowerPoint handouts.
OK.  So what's really important,

421
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
there are two things about
nucleotides that are really

422
00:36:53 --> 00:36:57
important.  One is this phosphate
and sugar because that is the way

423
00:36:57 --> 00:37:02
nucleotides polymerize
with one another.

424
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
And the other is the base which is
the part of the molecule that gives

425
00:37:07 --> 00:37:13
rise to the information.
Actually, let me just stop this and

426
00:37:13 --> 00:37:18
write the bases here.
So let me tell you the names of the

427
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24
bases.  And you need to know these.
There are four of them.  Five

428
00:37:24 --> 00:37:30
really.
There is adenine,

429
00:37:30 --> 00:37:37
guanine, cytosine and thymine.
And then there's also something

430
00:37:37 --> 00:37:45
that's an alternate to thymine
called uracil.

431
00:37:45 --> 00:37:52
And they are abbreviated by their
first letters.

432
00:37:52 --> 00:38:00
OK?  So A, G, C and T and U.
And you need to know these letters.

433
00:38:00 --> 00:38:07
And you need to know what they stand
for.  All right.

434
00:38:07 --> 00:38:16
So let me, in the last two minutes,

435
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
tell you about some properties.
Actually, let me tell you about the

436
00:38:22 --> 00:38:28
bond that forms the nucleic acid
polymer.  And then I'll finish this

437
00:38:28 --> 00:38:34
off next lecture.
The bond that forms the polymer is

438
00:38:34 --> 00:38:44
called a phosphodiester bond.

439
00:38:44 --> 00:38:48
And it forms by the reaction of the
phosphate and the sugar with one

440
00:38:48 --> 00:38:53
another, or groups on the phosphate
and the sugar with one another.

441
00:38:53 --> 00:38:58
The base has got nothing to do with
this polymerization.

442
00:38:58 --> 00:39:03
So we have here a phosphate with
some oxygens that's joined onto the

443
00:39:03 --> 00:39:09
sugar.  So I'm abbreviating the
phosphate P, I'm abbreviating the

444
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
sugar S, and I'm abbreviating the
base B.  OK?  And the sugar is

445
00:39:15 --> 00:39:21
attached to a base.
And the sugar has, in one part of

446
00:39:21 --> 00:39:27
it, a reactive hydroxyl group.
And the phosphate has some reactive

447
00:39:27 --> 00:39:31
oxygen groups.
And let's not worry too much about

448
00:39:31 --> 00:39:35
bonds and double bonds
and things for now.

449
00:39:35 --> 00:39:51
OK.  And I'm not worrying about

450
00:39:51 --> 00:39:55
charges on oxygens and things either.
What happens,

451
00:39:55 --> 00:39:59
basically, is that there is an
interaction between this hydroxyl

452
00:39:59 --> 00:40:03
group and the phosphate group,
OK, or one of the oxygens on the

453
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
phosphate group.
And you get out of this a linkage

454
00:40:07 --> 00:40:26
that goes --

455
00:40:26 --> 00:40:31
OK.  Where you get between the sugar
and the phosphate this

456
00:40:31 --> 00:40:37
phosphodiester linkage.
OK?  An OPO linkage that joins the

457
00:40:37 --> 00:40:42
two sugars to one another through a
phosphate molecule.

458
00:40:42 --> 00:40:48
This is your phosphodiester bond.
And I want to point out that the

459
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53
bases, which I will tell you next
time, are the part of the molecule

460
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59
that carries the information,
have got nothing to do with the

461
00:40:59 --> 00:41:04
polymerization of nucleic acids.
So I'm going to continue with this

462
00:41:04 --> 00:41:08
next time and briefly finish nucleic
acids and then move

463
00:41:08 --> 00:41:11
onto the proteins.
