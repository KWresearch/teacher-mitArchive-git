Transcript â€“ Lecture 25 

So systems refer to, as in any case, something working together.  In the case of 
biology, systems working together for a specific function.  The tissues and the 
cells working together to a specific function. 

We're going to begin with a discussion of the nervous system.  Let me write this 
on the board because you really need to know this definition. 

Many organs or tissues collectively giving one function.  And we're going to begin 
with a discussion of the nervous system.  The function of the nervous system is 
one of communication. 

But that single term communication really belies the complexity and the enormity 
of the nervous system.  Could I please have a couple of letter carriers? 

Why don't you [do the other side?].  So you can do each side.  OK?  All right. 
OK.  So we're going to talk about the nervous system and its role in 
communicating.  Communicating things coming from the outside in, 
communicating things that happen within your body.  Within the nervous system 
there is one type of cell that is the most important cell with regard to 
communication. 

And the term, the name of that cell type is a, wait.  I've got a new system here.  A 
neuron.  Very good.  Excellent.  Right.  It's sort of your moment of fame.  But you 
have to be careful, I might hand the microphone over for the rest of the lesson. 
OK.  So the cell type that you need to know is the neuron.  And the neuron is 
really a curious cell. 

In my opinion, it's one of the cells that is really one of the ancestral cell types.  In 
fact, I think it might have been one of the first cell types because the thing that all 
cells really have in common, whether they live as single-celled organisms or as 
multicellular organisms, is a way of sensing what's around them.  Even single-
celled animals sense whether or not there are particular chemicals around them. 

I showed you in the morphogenesis section the dictyostelium, single-cells moving 
towards a cyclic AMP source.  Those are single-cells sensing their environment. 
And I think ancestrally this kind of sensing of one's environment by a cell might 
have been the first function that really was encoded about the basic functions 
that allowed a cell to replicate in the first place. 

So if you look at all multicellular animals, this is taken from your book, all 
multicellular animals, you can find networks of neurons that serve as the wires for 
this communication network within an animal.  The nervous system begins to 
develop very early during human development.  By 19 days after fertilization you 
can pick out a region that is going to become the future brain. 

In studies in my own laboratory we've shown, using frogs and fish as models, 
that you can find cells that know, that are determined as nervous system cells 
when the embryo is still a ball of cells.  So in human equivalent terms, when it's 
really less than two week's old, you can find cells that are expressing genes that 
are characteristic of the nervous system.  So the nervous system starts to 
develop very early.  Now, the cell type characteristic of the communication part of 
the nervous system is the neuron. 

And it has two interesting features.  Its interesting features are called dendrites 
and axons.  The dendrites and axons are both processes that project out from a 
cell body.  Now, the cell body is where the nucleus lies, and these dendrites and 
axons are processes, some of which are extremely long.  So this is a single cell. 

And some axons can be a meter in length.  So there are axons that arise at the 
base of your spine, where they exit your spine, and they extend all the way down 
most of your legs.  So they can be a meter or more long.  That is a single-celled 
process.  So that's very thin, OK?  Not as thin as DNA but it's very thin.  And it 
must be fairly robust. 

Usually axons are bundled together and tied together by other tissue to make 
them more robust.  But they are very long.  And neurons communicate by means 
of these very long processes connected one to another.  And we'll talk more 
about that in a moment. 

Now, the way the nervous system is organized is actually rather peculiar and it 
isn't intuitively obvious that it would be organized in this way. 

Neurons, let me set this up, communicate, do a lot of their communication 
intracellularly, that is within one cell. 

And, actually, let me hold off on that until the next board.  Within one cell, as 
opposed to having multiple little cells all next to one another that have 
conversations with one another.  OK?  So you'll have a neuron that extends an 
axon that could be as long as these tables.  And that neuron will then 
communicate with another one next door in a kind of wiring diagram.  You could 
imagine an alternate way of communication where you had a little cell sitting next 
door to another cell, another cell, another cell, another cell and so on. 

And you would get the same pathway, you'd get the same circuitry, but it would 
be an intercellular means of communication.  And it's interesting to consider why 

that hasn't happened.  It probably hasn't happened because it's faster, for 
reasons I'll explain in a bit, to communicate within the cell than between cells.  So 
the neuron exploits for its communication its intracellular communication. 

Something that's present in all cells.  And this is a potential difference across the 
plasma membrane.  So all cells, as far as we know, have a potential difference 
across the membrane. 

And this is a number you probably ought to know.  It's about 60 millivolts.  Now, 
that doesn't sound that much, but if you extrapolate that into terms that we think 
about and think about the width of the plasma membrane which is just a few 
nanometers, that's actually a very large voltage difference. 

And if you do the calculations, you actually come to the conclusion that the 
potential difference across a cell membrane is about 100 fold higher than it is in 
high voltage power lines, OK, but it's very little.  The actual numbers are very 
little, and so you don't realize that.  But it's a very substantial potential difference. 
And what I'm going to tell you is that the neuron exploits this potential difference 
for intracellular communication. 

Now, all cells have got this potential difference.  And in most cells, and there 
must be some reason all cells do, otherwise it wouldn't be maintained.  But I must 
say for most cells it's not really understood why you have this potential difference 
across the membrane.  OK.  Moving on.  There are lots of different shaped 
neurons.  You can look at your book for a diagram.  These are some actual 
pictures that are taken of silver stained neurons. 

Neurons take up silver dyes very effectively and show up as black.  And you can 
see here is one with lots of processes.  Here are some with much fewer 
processes.  Here's one that is much, here are some that are much more tangled 
and so on.  So there are many different shapes and forms of neurons.  There are 
about 200 different recognizable neuronal cell types, and they're found in 
different parts of the nervous system and do different things. 

And as we move through these lectures, what I'm going to do is talk about today 
intracellular communication, next time I'll talk about communication between 
cells, and in the third lecture of the nervous system module I'll talk about how the 
wiring circuitry is set up in the organism.  But today the focus is going to be 
communication within the neuron.  All right. 

So I'm going to summarize that a little more because I want you to be with me. 
So some kind of input.  The notion is that some kind of input impinges on the 
dendrites, the dendritic processes of a neuron.  And these dendrites 
communicate this information often through the cell body, not always, to the axon 
of the same cell. 

And this axon then communicates to a dendrite of another adjacent cell. 

And that dendrite communicates with the axon and so on. 

So one can distinguish two different kinds of communication here.  The first is the 
one that I have told you already, intracellular communication.  And this is an 
electrical ionic movement.  Well, this is an electrical communication.  And it 
involves the movement of ions.  And the second kind of communication is 
between one cell and another. 

This is intercellular across something called a synapse, or synapse, depending 
on your preference.  And this is usually a chemical kind of communication, 
although in some instances it can be electrical.  OK?  And so, again, today's 
lecture we're going to talk about intracellular communication and on Wednesday 
we'll talk about this intercellular communication or synaptic communication. 

All right.  So let me go through briefly on the board the notion of how a neuron 
sends a signal from its point of origin along the length of this very long axon, or 
usually fairly long axon or sometimes long axons. 

Axons can be very different lengths, but they generally are much longer than 
your regular somatic cell which is just about 10 microns in diameter.  How is this 
intracellular communication affected?  So what I'm going to do is to draw you part 
of a cell.  We'll get to your diagrams in a moment, but I'm going to draw you part 
of a cell.  So this is the axon, part of an axon. 

PM is the plasma membrane.  And let me take just one piece of that plasma 
membrane and magnify it over here.  So we can have out and we can have in. 
And the deal is this.  The cell is set up, and we'll talk about how in a moment, 
such that it is more positively charged in the extracellular environment than it is in 
the intracellular environment. 

And that is stable.  And it's stable at a particular potential that I've given you 
already, the 60 millivolts, which is called the resting potential.  Now, along comes 
some kind of input, a sound, a touch, some food that you've eaten. 

And the neuron is told that there's an input.  And what this does is in one portion 
of this axonal cell membrane, plasma membrane, it reverses the polarity 
transiently and very profoundly such that --

-- in this region, I'll just circle it.  I think it's easier. 

In this region of the plasma membrane you have switched the polarity.  This 
switching of polarity gives a change in potential difference.  It almost reverses the 
potential difference completely.  So whereas it's minus 60 millivolts in your 

resting potential inside to outside, it almost completely reverses to about plus 50 
millivolts. 

And this reversal of polarity --

-- is given the name a depolarization or is a depolarization.  And its neurobiology 
term, which you must know, is an action potential. 

All right.  So this is very interesting, but what's even more interesting is what 
happens next.  And so you should be asking at this point, well, how does that 
happen?  And I'll tell you that in a bit.  But what even more interesting is what 
happens next because that depolarization, that action potential then moves along 
the neuron. 

So if we draw a couple more, we actually only need to draw one more view of our 
cell membrane, after some period of time, and this is a millisecond timeframe 
here.  After the millisecond timeframe, that initial depolarization reverses, and 
next door the membrane depolarizes. 

OK.  So the signal then propagates along the neuron, along the axon in a 
particular direction.  And you're going to ask now, well, how does it know which 
direction to propagate in?  And I'll tell you that in a moment, too.  Interestingly, 
the action potential is all or none.  You either reverse the polarity completely or 
you don't. 

You don't get a little action potential or a big action potential.  You get an action 
potential.  OK?  And that's important to know.  So that is enough to start.  And if 
you look at the handout I gave you today, if you don't have look at the one next 
door or come and zip down here and get one, that would be fine. 

I have in my first cartoon the outside of the cell and the inside of the cell.  Now, 
I've shown these as completely positive and completely negative.  That is a lie. 
They are not.  OK?  There is a potential difference.  And so there's a charge 
distribution that's unequal, but it is certainly not completely positive and 
completely negative.  That is for cartoon purposes only.  So here's your resting 
potential and here's input from the outside of the cell. 

And what happens, to initiate this action potential, is that there is a small change 
in the membrane potential.  It just changes a little bit such that it's now at minus 
50 millivolts or so instead of minus 60 millivolts.  And that is enough of a trigger 
to tell that membrane, and the membrane right next door, to depolarize and to 
give a full-blown action potential. 

So now that piece of the membrane has reversed its polarity.  Positive charges 
have rushed into the cell.  I'll talk about this more in the mechanism in the 
moment.  Positive charges have rushed into the cell, or positive ions have rushed 

into the cell, and you've got your action potential.  So the action potential is this 
reversal in membrane polarization, this depolarization. 

The action potential gives you an unequal charge distribution within the cell, so 
you've got these positive ions around.  And they actually start defusing a little bit. 
Now, the axon is not a very good current conductor.  Charges leak out of it.  And 
very rather quickly and in an active way this charge in equality will be 
redistributed.  But it does leak a little bit.  It moves a little bit by diffusion. 

And, as it does so, it depolarizes the membrane next door just a tad to this 
threshold potential.  And that will make this membrane next door amenable to an 
action potential and it will depolarize, and so will get an action potential next 
door.  Now, I drew up here on the board that you get, in the first place where 
there was an action potential, the redistribution of charges again so that you get 
rid of the positive charges on the inside. 

And I've depicted this here.  OK?  So here are the charges from, this is all on 
your handout, guys, OK?  These are the first, I believe, three figures on your 
handouts.  So look at them and make notes, but you certainly don't need to draw 
these.  OK.  So here I've depicted the axis positive charges, the axis positive ions 
being moved back out of the neuron.  And I've put these circles with a line 
through the middle which conventionally means no something or other. 

And what it means in this case is that this membrane that had just been part of 
an action potential is now no longer competent to elicit another action potential. 
There's some kind of inhibition that's been put on it so it cannot give another 
action potential.  So it re-polarizes, but it cannot re-depolarize.  And, again, there 
is about a millisecond timeframe window before it can depolarize again. 

And you can do the same thing.  You can get the action potential moving up 
along the neuron.  Here's the direction of propagation.  And the direction of 
propagation is a result of diffusion, slight diffusion of the positive ions that are 
coming in during the depolarization that change the threshold, that change the 
membrane potential right next door to a threshold potential which allows the 
action potential to be triggered. 

And the propagation direction is unidirectional because the membrane that has 
just depolarized, that previously depolarized is no longer able to re-depolarize for 
some lag period.  Yes?  Maybe?  Whatever?  All right.  We'll go with whatever 
category. 

OK.  I always have to work at this.  OK?  I study this stuff and it takes me a while. 
So think about it.  It's actually a very elegant strategy by the cell.  You'll deal with 
this more on problem sets.  All right.  So let me move on.  And let me move onto 
the question, actually, I'm not going to move onto this question.  Yes.  I'm going 
to move onto, all right. 

I will move onto this question.  I'm going to tell you more next time that the action 
potential initiates at one particular place in the cell which is right at the place 
where the axon starts.  And that is called the axon hillock.  And we'll talk more 
about this next time when we talk about synapses.  I do want to very briefly 
address the speed of propagation of the action potential. 

So it's been calculated that action potentials move at a speed such that you, if 
you ran the length of a football in one second, that is how fast the action potential 
is propagating down the neuron. OK?  So you can do the calculation of how 
many meters per second it is.  It's very, very rapid.  OK?  So you could get a 
nerve impulse in milliseconds going from one part of your body to another.  It's 
actually interesting, though, it's not that rapid.  And you've probably all had the 
sensation of touching a hot stove or something hot. 

And it takes you a moment before you actually realize that you've touched the hot 
stove.  And then realize and you remove your finger.  That lag, that moment of 
realization is a measure of your action potentials getting to your brain and then 
your brain saying, wow, or not even quite in your brain saying, ooh, I better move 
my finger.  So that's actually a measure.  There is a finite time that propagation 
takes.  OK. 

Now, propagation of action potentials can be increased by increasing the 
diameter of a neuron.  The fatter the diameter the greater the, the lower the 
surface area to volume ratio the more that current can move within the cell before 
being dissipated in various ways.  And things like invertebrates, so the squid for 
example, has got axons which are a millimeter in diameter. 

They're called squid giant axons.  They've very popular preparations to be used 
in neurobiological studies because they're so big.  And they are very, they 
transmit an action potential very rapidly, or they propagate it very rapidly because 
they've got this high volume to surface area ratio.  We do not do that to increase 
the speed of propagation.  What we do instead is to wrap our axons in insulation. 
And the insulation we wrap our axons in is called myelin. 

It's secreted by cells called Schwann cells that are part of a system of support 
cells in the nervous system called the glia.  And these myelin sheaths that wrap 
around the neuron do two things.  Firstly, they prevent leakage of current as it 
moves along inside the axon.  And so you get rapid propagation of current inside 
the axon.  And, secondly, you get depolarization only at specific places where 
there is a break in this insulating myelin sheath. 

From your book, this is front your book.  And from your book also I have taken 
this diagram where, it's actually hard to see here, but this is a break between the 
myelin sheath.  It's called a Node of Ranvier.  And here is where you get 

depolarization.  The ions that cause the depolarization rapidly move along inside 
the axon to the next place where depolarization can take place. 

And that really increases the speed of propagation of a signal in our own 
neurons.  All right.  But, you might be asking, how is this potential difference set 
up and how is propagation occurring at the mechanistic level?  I've thrown out 
charge movement, ion movement in a somewhat undirected way, but let's try to 
be more directed now and talk about what is actually happening. 

And the thing that's really important to know about is a set of proteins, actually, 
two sets of proteins.  One are called ion channels and the other are called 
pumps.  So the membrane is a wonderful thing.  They insulate cells from one 
another.  It allows the cells to function as a unit.  And, indeed, it allows 
intracellular organelles to function as a unit. 

But there is an issue with the membrane in that it's insulating.  And very little can 
get across it unless it's a hydrophobic something.  So anything hydrophilic, 
including water, cannot cross the plasma membrane.  And so you have to now 
devise, you've got this great invention of the membrane, but now you've got to 
devise a way to actually get things in and out of the cell.  And this is where 
channels and pumps come in. 

So an ion channel is a protein, or usually a set of proteins that work together, that 
make a channel, a pore or a channel in the plasma membrane. 

There are a couple of different kinds of channels you should know about.  All of 
them are selective. 

Selective means that they let some things through and don't let other things 
through.  Some of them are open all the time.  They also may be called leaky.  I 
don't really like that term.  I think open is a better term.  And some of them have 
regulated opening.  They're closed but they can be opened.  And these are called 
gated channels. 

Another class of proteins that you need to know about are the pumps.  Pumps 
are also proteins that sit in the plasma membrane.  And they transport things 
across the plasma membrane, too, but unlike channels which are literally pores 
through the membrane and things can move through by diffusion, pumps use 
ATP to transport things across the cell membrane. 

And you can have things going into the cell, you can have things going out of the 
cell, and you can have things going both ways at kind of the same time.  And ion 
channels are really key here in terms of setting up the membrane potential and 
propagating an action potential.  This is a reconstruction of an x-ray 
crystalographic analysis of an ion channel. 

So what you can see is that there are nine, eight different proteins that are 
arrayed together to form this circle.  And in the middle is a hole, literally, and that 
is the pore.  And that is the pore through which the ion will move.  And it's very 
interesting that the selectivity of an ion channel, well, how do you get a ion 
channel selected?  Well, it hasn't been clear until this kind of analysis, which is 
fascinating. 

So here is a potassium channel down here.  So this is something that lets 
potassium through, but it will not let sodium through, even though sodium is 
smaller than potassium, that sodium ions are smaller than potassium ions.  So 
how does that work?  Well, the way it seems to work is that the ions get through 
the pore if the pore doesn't know they're there or if the ion doesn't know it's going 
through a pore.  So if the ion cannot distinguish whether it's interacting with water 
in solution or with the ion channel, it will be able to diffuse through the pore. 

If it can distinguish it thermodynamically it will not.  So here's an example.  Here 
is potassium interacting with water.  Notice the spacing of the oxygens and the 
potassium.  And here's sodium interacting with water.  And you can see that 
since sodium is smaller the oxygen, the spacing of the oxygens and the sodium 
is closer, tighter. 

When potassium goes through the pore it turns out that there are a number of 
oxygen sticking out into the pore, and they interact with potassium in exactly the 
same disposition with exactly the same spacing as those water molecules in 
water.  So this potassium ion cannot tell whether it's interacting with water or 
whether it's traveling through the pore.  On the other hand, if the sodium ion were 
to get near the pore its charge interactions would not be the same as they are in 
water. 

It would only be able to interact with two of the oxygens and not the other two. 
And this is thermodynamically unfavorable, and it would not be able to go 
through the pore.  So this is a very recent and very beautiful explanation of how 
pores can be selective.  The ions go through one at a time in single file, and they 
can go through very rapidly because this is a diffusion driven process.  OK.  Now, 
what about these gated channels? 

I've shown here, from your book, a picture of an open channel and a gated 
channel that is open sometimes and closes at other times.  The voltage gated 
sodium channel, we'll talk more about in a moment, is a particularly important 
channel.  And this is a diagram that is, you know, it's a diagram but it will illustrate 
two points that I want to make.  Firstly, you can find a state of a gated channel 
where it's closed and it won't let any ions go through. 

Upon a stimulus that channel will open and it will let the ions through.  And then 
what seems to happen is that there's some kind of lash back where the channel 
says uh-oh, and there's some feedback that goes and closes the channel.  But 

it's not in the same way that it was closed in the first place.  And so I've called 
that an inhibition or closing or being refractory.  And if you think about what I told 
you about propagation of information along a neuron, you'll be able to see why I 
am starting to tell you this. 

And then later on the system resets itself and is amenable to being used again. 
OK.  I should point out this is an ion channel.  This is a gated ion channel.  The 
Nobel Prize a couple of years ago was given to Rod MacKinnon and a colleague 
whose name escapes me for getting the structure of these gated ion channels. 
And the notion is, I'll be an ion channel now.  The notion is that in the membrane 
you're normally sitting something like this.  OK? 

As an ion channel you get some kind of stimulus.  The confirmation, and in the 
case of the neuron it's going to be an electrical stimulus, that slight threshold 
depolarization.  And that is going to change the charge distribution on the 
proteins.  Those proteins will undergo some kind of conformational something 
and they'll move like this and they'll open up the channel.  OK? And we know a 
bit more than that, but the notion is exactly that. 

That changing the charge on the proteins of an ion channel, of a gated ion 
channel changes the confirmation of the protein and the channel opens up.  All 
right.  So I want to talk now, and I'll use the diagrams that I've given you, about 
how you generate the resting potential and how you generate the action potential 
in terms of the specific ions and the specific channels that are being used. 

All right.  Channels that generate the resting potential, and actually I don't need 
to write this on the board because this is, these are going to be the last three 
diagrams, diagrams four and five and six on the handout that I gave you today. 

So how do you get this potential difference across a plasma membrane?  Well, in 
all cells, not just neurons, in all cells it seems to be a function of something called 
a sodium-potassium ATPase.  And I will write this.  The sodium-potassium 
ATPase is a pump. 

OK?  And its name kind of tells you that.  The ATPase.  It pumps sodium out of 
the cell and it pumps potassium into the cell.  And you can look in your book for a 
bit more information about this.  There is a fairly detailed understanding of the 
mechanism by which it does this.  It's a very complex mechanism, but this gives 
you a gradient of sodium, or gives you unequal distribution of sodium and 
potassium ions across a plasma membrane. 

But, of course, that doesn't necessarily give you a membrane potential.  That just 
gives you sodium on one side and potassium on the other side.  So how do you 
get the membrane potential?  Well, this is very interesting because what you do 
is use some channels that are open all the time. 

Now, what you've done with this sodium-potassium ATPase is to pump 
potassium in and sodium out.  So you've got high potassium on the inside of the 
cell.  If you open up the potassium channels, the potassium is going to diffuse 
down its concentration gradient and get out of the cell until there is some kind of 
charge pull and you get an equilibrium because it's being pulled back and pulled 
out and diffusing out with equal force. 

The sodium channels are closed, so sodium is trapped outside the cell.  And 
these three things, the sodium being pumped out, the potassium pumped in, the 
open potassium channels and the fact that there are no open sodium channels 
gives you this unequal charge distribution across the membrane.  Now, obviously 
there has to be some balance between this sodium-potassium ATPase action 
and the channels. 

Otherwise, you would not get a membrane potential.  But there is.  And the 
sodium-potassium ATPase pumps just enough that you maintain this membrane 
potential.  OK.  So that's your resting potential.  How about your action potential? 
So your action potential involves another set of channels.  And the channels it 
involves are these gates --

-- sodium channels. 

OK.  So in the region, this is not animated, I'm going to tell you this.  In the region 
of the membrane where there is an action potential, these gated sodium 
channels that are closed elsewhere open up and allow sodium to move down its 
concentration gradient into the cell. 

And they do it on a very mini scale, OK, over micron or submicron domains of the 
cell membrane.  So you're getting this very little region of the membrane where 
these sodium channels are opening and they're voltage-dependent opening 
through this conformational change I belatedly demonstrated to you.  At the 
same time there is a set of channels, which are gated potassium channels, and 
those are closed. 

There is a phase of repolarization that follows the action potential.  And during 
this the gated potassium channels open up, potassium leaves the cell, and the 
gated sodium channels close up.  And, as I mentioned, the ones in the vicinity of 
the action potential, or the ones that have just opened are now refractory for 
opening for another millisecond or so. 

So in the repolarization you use potassium channels, but a different set of 
potassium channels, a set of gated potassium channels. 

And you're also using the sodium-potassium ATPase during this time, because 
the sodium has to get out of the cell eventually.  OK?  And it will do so through 
the sodium-potassium ATPase exchange. 

All right.  Here is a movie that will illustrate these different points.  This is a 
diagram of an axon.  I've got in a loop so we'll look at it a number of times.  The 
membrane is shown in pink, and these boxes are the ion channels that are 
initially closed.  And as the action potential moves along the axon they open up. 

So here it comes again.  They're closed.  And here they are opening sequentially 
to allow the action potential to propagate.  Behind the action potential, take a 
look.  You'll see that they remain closed for a while as it propagates.  And then 
they eventually open up and reset themselves.  And so this is a very beautiful 
example of an intracellular feedback loop, both a negative and positive feedback 
loop. 

And so here you're regulating.  If you'd like to think of it in terms of regulating 
gene expression, you're kind of doing it at a very mini level.  You're regulating 
gene activity, certainly, or the outcome, the products of gene activity.  This is a 
diagram above.  I haven't dwelled on this.  You'll see this more in section of the 
depolarization, the action potential moving along.  And you can depict that, as it's 
often done, by showing, by plotting change in potential against time. 

All right. 

Again, this is taken from your book.  Here's a diagram of the threshold potential, 
the action potential and the repolarization. 

And I'm going to end off with a teaser for next lecture.  OK?  So that's what I want 
to say to you about the action potential.  I'm going to end off with a teaser for the 
next lecture.  These are two neurons.  Each of the red dots, see the red dots? 
You probably cannot see them because there are so many.  They kind of look 
like a red blur. 

But, in fact, they're each red dots.  Each of those red dots is a connection 
between one of these two neurons with another neuron.  It is a synapse.  So 
we've talked about moving the signal through the neuron, but now we are at the 
point where the neuron, that axon needs to pass its signal onto the next neuron. 
And it's going to do it through the synapse, but it's not necessarily going to do it 
through one synapse per cell or one synapse per axon. 

It's going to do it through up to 1,000 or even more perhaps connections from 
each axon to the next one.  And what I'm going to talk to you about next time is 
how this is set up.  We have a couple of minutes left so I will take you coming 
down here and asking me questions, and I'll finish the class now.  Thank you.
