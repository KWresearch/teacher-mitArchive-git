1
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
OK.  We are wrapping up our segment
on genetics today,

2
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24
Genetics 4.  We're going to talk
about human disease genetics,

3
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
modes of inheritance for human
diseased genes.

4
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
And then we'll transition next time
into molecular biology,

5
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
which is the next blank square here.
And then recombinant DNA cell

6
00:00:38 --> 00:00:43
biology and beyond.
I wanted to start today by clearing

7
00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
up a couple of things.
Firstly, the term F1,

8
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
in the last lecture I gave you a
list of terms,

9
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
and I used this definition of the
first filial generation,

10
00:00:56 --> 00:01:01
the F1 generation as the product of
crosses between two homozygous

11
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
individuals, homozygous for
different alleles such that the

12
00:01:05 --> 00:01:09
offspring were always heterozygous,
big A, little A at that particular

13
00:01:09 --> 00:01:14
gene.
Well, it turns out that some people

14
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
use the term F1 to refer to the
offspring of any cross.

15
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
So you have the parents and you
have the F1s regardless of the

16
00:01:22 --> 00:01:26
genotype of the parents.
So that's a looser definition of

17
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
the term F1.  And it's been used in
Section and so on,

18
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
so I didn't want to confuse you.
The strict definition is the one I

19
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
told you, but don't get hung up on
that.  We're always going to give

20
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
you the relevant genotypes so you'll
be able to figure out what the

21
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
genotypes of the offspring are.
Also, near the end of the last

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
lecture, I talked about crosses
involving linked genes.

23
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
If you remember the Y and D gene
controlling color and density,

24
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
I think, of peas.  And I told you
that they were linked,

25
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
and we carried out a test cross.
And we then worked out what the

26
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
percentages of the different
phenotypes and genotypes would be.

27
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
Well, in that example,
I assumed that the Y allele and the

28
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
D allele were together on the same
chromosome.  But importantly if

29
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
you're just given the genotype as
it's written here,

30
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
you actually cannot know that.
The big Y might be on the opposite

31
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
chromosome from the big D.
So to avoid confusion about that

32
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
sort of thing,
in future examples and in problems,

33
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
problems, that is test questions,
we'll always show you the

34
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
chromosomes so you'll know that the
genes are together on the same

35
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
chromosome or on opposite.
Yeah.  And in the absence of this,

36
00:02:35 --> 00:02:40
if the question is to tell us what
the alleles must look like and they

37
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
give you the phenotype,
you have to conclude the genotype.

38
00:02:45 --> 00:02:50
If the question is tell us what the
alleles must look like then we're

39
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
not going to give you the answer,
but in other situations where

40
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
there's ambiguity about what the
alignment might be, we'll

41
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
tell you what that is.
OK?  We also had a question from a

42
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
student, actually an emailed
question, those are also welcome,

43
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
email question from a student.  It
was good question because in our

44
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
discussion of dominance and
recessiveness,

45
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
we really haven't dealt with the
molecular nature of that.

46
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
And that was this individual's
interest.  Why is an allele dominant

47
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
over another one?
Why is a trait dominant over

48
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
another one?
And I gave an example to him,

49
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
which I will give to you, which I
think covers most of the examples

50
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
that we've been discussing in class.
And it also is an opportunity for

51
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
me to reinforce the notions related
to chromosomes,

52
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
genes, DNA and proteins,
because apparently there are some of

53
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
you who are still a little fuzzy on
those relationships.

54
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
So let's imagine a gene which is
present on a chromosome.

55
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
Chromosome shown here.  Gene shown
here.  And it's the S gene that

56
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
we've talked about before that
controls smooth versus

57
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
wrinkled pea texture.
So here's the S gene.

58
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
It's made up of DNA.  And based on
the sequence of that DNA within the

59
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
gene, therein lies the information
to produce a protein.

60
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
And we're going to call this
protein, in our example,

61
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
this is a hypothetical example,
the starch synthase protein.  It's

62
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
an enzyme that controls a reaction,
that catalyzes a reaction from some

63
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
sugar substrate into some starch.
And if you make enough of that

64
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
starch product then you
have a smooth shape.

65
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
OK?  This enzyme controls shape
because it produces this product

66
00:04:36 --> 00:04:41
which is involved in the shape of a
pea.  OK?  So this is the normal

67
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
situation.  The big S allele
produces a functional starch

68
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
synthase enzyme which produces
enough product to give the pea its

69
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
smooth shape.  In this example,
the little S allele, which is the

70
00:04:55 --> 00:05:00
recessive one,
has a mutation within the coding

71
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
sequence of the gene.
We won't talk about the nature of

72
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
that mutation just yet,
what it is, why it causes what it

73
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
does because you're going to get
that in the next segment.

74
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
Just suffice to say that it's a
mutation, an alteration of the DNA

75
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
such that the protein that's
produced from this allele is

76
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
nonfunctional.
You might be able to see I've

77
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
inserted a little X there.
It's actually quite little and

78
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
invisible on your handout,
but you might want to just circle it

79
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
if you look carefully.
There's a little X there which is

80
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
the result of this mutation.
And that X causes the protein to be

81
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
nonfunctional.
The enzyme now does not catalyze

82
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
the production of this starch
product, so no starch product is

83
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
produced.  If you don't make the
starch product you don't have a

84
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
smooth shape, you have a wrinkled
shape.  OK?  If the genotype of the

85
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
pea is little S,
little S then none of this enzyme is

86
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
produced such that none of the
starch product is produced such that

87
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
the pea is wrinkled.
OK?  Now what happens if you're big

88
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
S, little S, the heterozygote?
Well, for many biochemical reactions,

89
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
having just one copy of the gene
that encodes the functional enzyme

90
00:06:07 --> 00:06:12
is enough.  For many biochemical
reactions that's true.

91
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
And so in a situation where big S
is dominant over little S,

92
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
we assume that having one copy of
big S makes enough of the starch

93
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
synthase protein to make enough of
that starch product to give the pea

94
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
its smooth shape.  OK?
So that's a simple example of why

95
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
big S is dominant over little S,
why you only see the phenotype

96
00:06:35 --> 00:06:40
associated with the little S allele,
the wrinkled phenotype when you have

97
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
two copies of the little S allele.
OK?  So I hope that helps clarify

98
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
the situation for you and actually
is useful as we talk about human

99
00:06:48 --> 00:06:53
disease genes as well.
So this is a slide from your book

100
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
which allows us to transition from
concepts of inheritance

101
00:06:57 --> 00:07:02
to real-life stuff.
Genes that regulate how your body

102
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
functions normally or in response to
various environmental stresses.

103
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
We're now in an era where we can
relatively easily figure out whether

104
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
a disease has a genetic component by
looking at families that might have

105
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
that disease, and based on that
information and using mapping

106
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
techniques like I described to you
last time, we can isolate where that

107
00:07:23 --> 00:07:28
gene might lie on all
of your chromosomes.

108
00:07:28 --> 00:07:32
And then using molecular techniques,
which we'll talk about in future

109
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
lectures, we can actually isolate
that gene, determine its sequence,

110
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
and based on that produce lots of
various valuable things like better

111
00:07:40 --> 00:07:44
ways to diagnose the disease,
better ways to understand how the

112
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
disease process takes place such
that we can then perhaps prevent the

113
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
disease from occurring in the first
place or treating it more

114
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
effectively by replacing the gene
with a new copy or producing a drug

115
00:07:56 --> 00:08:01
that can replace the
gene in other ways.

116
00:08:01 --> 00:08:06
So this is what we're after.
So we need to understand diseased

117
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
genes and how they behave in such
affected families.

118
00:08:12 --> 00:08:17
So there are a number of diseases
which have a genetic component.

119
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
And these diseases have various
modes of inheritance.

120
00:08:23 --> 00:08:36
Some of them are autosomal dominant.

121
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
The diseased gene is dominant over
the wild type gene,

122
00:08:42 --> 00:08:48
and I'll give you examples of that.
And the term autosomal means that

123
00:08:48 --> 00:08:54
it's not sex linked.
That is the disease gene is carried

124
00:08:54 --> 00:09:00
on chromosomes 1 through 22,
one of the those chromosomes,

125
00:09:00 --> 00:09:06
not on the X or the Y.
It doesn't matter if your father,

126
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
whether the disease gene is coming
from a male or a female,

127
00:09:10 --> 00:09:15
passed on to a daughter or a son.
There's no sex linkage for these

128
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
autosomal dominant diseases.
There another class of genes,

129
00:09:19 --> 00:09:24
disease genes which follow autosomal
recessive inheritance patterns.

130
00:09:24 --> 00:09:29
Here the disease gene is recessive
to wild type.

131
00:09:29 --> 00:09:35
You only see the disease phenotype
when you're homozygous for the

132
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
mutant allele.
And, again, autosomal because it's

133
00:09:41 --> 00:09:48
not sex linked.
There are X linked diseases which

134
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
are dominant.  In this case,
the disease gene is on the X

135
00:09:54 --> 00:10:01
chromosome.  There are also X linked
diseases that are recessive.

136
00:10:01 --> 00:10:11
There are very few,

137
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
but for the sake of completeness,
Y linked diseases.  But there are so

138
00:10:15 --> 00:10:20
few that we're actually not going to
talk about them at all in this class.

139
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
And, finally,
there's a class of diseases that

140
00:10:24 --> 00:10:29
we're also not going to talk about
but get inherited not from the genes

141
00:10:29 --> 00:10:33
that are in the nucleus of the cell
along your chromosomes but rather

142
00:10:33 --> 00:10:38
get inherited from the
mitochondria.

143
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
And since we haven't talked about
mitochondria with you really at all

144
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
we're not going to expect you to
know about those diseases,

145
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
but just have in the back of your
minds that those are relatively

146
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
important.  Autosomal dominant
diseases are not terribly common.

147
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
There are about 200 known.
Autosomal recessive diseases are

148
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
actually much more common,
though not very frequent in the

149
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
population.
There are about 2,

150
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
00 of these known.  And together I
would estimate there are about 25

151
00:11:12 --> 00:11:18
sex linked diseases.
So we've used the term autosomal

152
00:11:18 --> 00:11:24
dominant, autosomal recessive,
sex linked.  What does this really

153
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
look like in terms of the
genes and the alleles?

154
00:11:30 --> 00:11:43
Well, just as in the case of peas,

155
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
a dominant disease allele will cause
disease regardless of the nature of

156
00:11:48 --> 00:11:54
the other allele.
It's dominant over the normal

157
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59
common version of the gene.
So if we call this allele the

158
00:11:59 --> 00:12:11
disease allele of some gene --

159
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
-- and this allele the commonly
found on in the population,

160
00:12:16 --> 00:12:22
and we refer to these often as the
wild type --

161
00:12:22 --> 00:12:31
-- in an individual who has this

162
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
genotype for a dominant disease gene,
will they develop disease?

163
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
Yes, because the disease allele is
dominant over the normal copy of the

164
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
gene.  So these individuals
will develop disease.

165
00:12:49 --> 00:13:04
For recessive disease alleles you

166
00:13:04 --> 00:13:08
need to have both copies,
both alleles be mutant in order to

167
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
manifest the disease.
So here's another gene,

168
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
which we'll call the H gene,
which has a disease allele.  This

169
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
individual is homozygous for the
disease allele.

170
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
Will this individual develop
disease?

171
00:13:24 --> 00:13:31
There might be other people in the

172
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
population who are heterozygous for
that allele and have a wild type

173
00:13:35 --> 00:13:40
allele on the other chromosome.
Will they develop disease?  No.

174
00:13:40 --> 00:13:45
These individuals are called
heterozygous carriers.

175
00:13:45 --> 00:13:54
They carry the disease allele,

176
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
but because they also carry a wild
type allele they don't develop the

177
00:13:58 --> 00:14:03
disease.  They're normal.
They're normal in the sense of their

178
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
phenotype.  They have an abnormal
genotype in the sense that they have

179
00:14:09 --> 00:14:16
a disease allele,
but they're normal in the sense of

180
00:14:16 --> 00:14:23
their genotype,
phenotype.  Now,

181
00:14:23 --> 00:14:30
for X linked genes,
sorry, before I do that let me --

182
00:14:30 --> 00:14:35
Let me review for you sex
determination.

183
00:14:35 --> 00:14:40
We talked about this briefly.
In order to understand the

184
00:14:40 --> 00:14:45
inheritance pattern for X linked
genes you need to remember this.

185
00:14:45 --> 00:14:50
That males of course have one X
chromosome and one Y chromosome.

186
00:14:50 --> 00:14:55
Females have two X chromosomes.
If you think of a Punnett Square

187
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
related to the inheritance of
chromosomes males will pass along an

188
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
X or a Y at 50% each,
females will pass along one of their

189
00:15:03 --> 00:15:16
two Xs.

190
00:15:16 --> 00:15:22
Will produce an equal number of
males and females from such crosses.

191
00:15:22 --> 00:15:28
But it's important to think about
where the X chromosomes come from,

192
00:15:28 --> 00:15:34
specifically males and the Y
chromosomes.

193
00:15:34 --> 00:15:41
Males transmit their only Y,
their only Y to all of their sons.

194
00:15:41 --> 00:15:48
If you're the son then you've
gotten your father's only Y.

195
00:15:48 --> 00:15:56
Males transmit their only X
chromosome to all of

196
00:15:56 --> 00:16:06
their daughters.

197
00:16:06 --> 00:16:11
If you're the daughter,
when you're the daughter of a male,

198
00:16:11 --> 00:16:17
you have inherited his X chromosome.
OK?

199
00:16:17 --> 00:16:27
Females transmit either X to each

200
00:16:27 --> 00:16:35
daughter or son.
In the case of the female X,

201
00:16:35 --> 00:16:43
you can be a male who got this X
chromosome or a male who got this X

202
00:16:43 --> 00:16:51
chromosome.  You can be a female who
got this X chromosome or a female

203
00:16:51 --> 00:16:59
who got this X chromosome.
And that's important for

204
00:16:59 --> 00:17:05
understanding the disease genetics.
So let's imagine a dominant disease

205
00:17:05 --> 00:17:14
involving the X chromosome.

206
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
A gene, we'll call it Q.
Males only have one X chromosome.

207
00:17:20 --> 00:17:27
They only have one X chromosome,
therefore if they carry the disease

208
00:17:27 --> 00:17:34
gene they're going
to get disease.

209
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
Females have two X chromosomes.
They might carry the disease allele

210
00:17:38 --> 00:17:43
on one but a normal copy on the
other.  In this scenario,

211
00:17:43 --> 00:17:47
will they develop disease?
Yes, because it's a dominant

212
00:17:47 --> 00:18:00
disease allele.

213
00:18:00 --> 00:18:06
For recessive X linked disease,
once again, males only have one X.

214
00:18:06 --> 00:18:12
Are they going to get disease?  Yes.
Females have two X chromosomes.

215
00:18:12 --> 00:18:18
If they carry a disease allele on
one they are likely to carry a wild

216
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
type copy on the other.
Are they going to get disease?

217
00:18:24 --> 00:18:31
No.  They're going to be
heterozygous carriers.

218
00:18:31 --> 00:18:38
And you'll see how this plays out

219
00:18:38 --> 00:18:46
towards the end of the lecture.

220
00:18:46 --> 00:18:51
OK.  So let's look at some examples.
We're going to start with recessive

221
00:18:51 --> 00:18:57
diseases first,
recessive autosomal diseases first.

222
00:18:57 --> 00:19:02
And one you've already seen before,

223
00:19:02 --> 00:19:08
and that's PKU, phenylketonuria.  If
you recall, this is a disease which

224
00:19:08 --> 00:19:14
is associated with failure to make
an enzyme that converts

225
00:19:14 --> 00:19:20
phenylalanine to tyrosine.
It's an enzyme called phenylalanine

226
00:19:20 --> 00:19:26
hydroxylase.  If you don't have that
enzyme then you produce too much of

227
00:19:26 --> 00:19:32
this byproduct,
phenylpyruvic acid which is toxic

228
00:19:32 --> 00:19:38
and leads to brain damage
and retardation.

229
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
This can be avoided,
the disease can be avoided by

230
00:19:40 --> 00:19:43
limiting your amount of dietary
phenylalanine.

231
00:19:43 --> 00:19:46
And that's why such patients are
not supposed to have Equal,

232
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
as we discussed before.  The disease,
PKU, is autosomal recessive.

233
00:19:49 --> 00:19:52
The incidence is rare, about one in
10,000 to 15,000 individuals have

234
00:19:52 --> 00:19:55
PKU.  As I talked to you about last
time, the mutant allele has a single

235
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
amino acid chain change in the
active site of this enzyme which

236
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
changes an arginine residue to a
tryptophan residue.

237
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
And that makes the enzyme inactive.
This is an autosomal recessive

238
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
disease.  So if you have one mutant
allele and one normal copy of the

239
00:20:10 --> 00:20:15
phenylalanine hydroxylase gene,
do you have the disease?  No.  You

240
00:20:15 --> 00:20:20
would be a carrier but you would not
have the disease symptoms.

241
00:20:20 --> 00:20:25
Because again, as in the other
hypothetical example,

242
00:20:25 --> 00:20:29
most of the time, if you have a
single normal copy of an enzyme that

243
00:20:29 --> 00:20:34
carries out some biochemical
reaction that's enough and your

244
00:20:34 --> 00:20:39
phenotype is normal.
Here's another common example,

245
00:20:39 --> 00:20:43
cystic fibrosis.  This is actually a
more common disease.

246
00:20:43 --> 00:20:47
It affects about one in 2,
00 to 3,000 individuals.  That's not

247
00:20:47 --> 00:20:51
an insignificant number.
So there are a lot of people with

248
00:20:51 --> 00:20:55
cystic fibrosis in this country.
Again, it's autosomal recessive.

249
00:20:55 --> 00:20:59
Patients present with the disease
at birth.

250
00:20:59 --> 00:21:03
They have problems both in their
intestinal system as well as in

251
00:21:03 --> 00:21:07
their lungs.  It tends to be the
lung symptoms that ultimately kills

252
00:21:07 --> 00:21:11
the patient due to inability to
breathe properly,

253
00:21:11 --> 00:21:15
but actually more importantly
persistent infections which

254
00:21:15 --> 00:21:19
ultimately are so severe that they
lead to death.

255
00:21:19 --> 00:21:23
And these patients tend to die
within the first two to three

256
00:21:23 --> 00:21:27
decades of life.
The gene encoded by the disease,

257
00:21:27 --> 00:21:31
the gene responsible for this
disease is a chloride channel.

258
00:21:31 --> 00:21:34
When it functions properly it allows
chloride ions to move through,

259
00:21:34 --> 00:21:38
and this achieves a proper water
balance inside the cells.

260
00:21:38 --> 00:21:41
When the disease allele is present
in both copies,

261
00:21:41 --> 00:21:45
this channel is not formed properly,
and therefore the water balance in

262
00:21:45 --> 00:21:49
such cells is not correct and it
leads to the build up of this kind

263
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
of mucousy sticky substance both in
the lungs and in the intestines.

264
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
These individuals, as you can see,
have a very hard time breathing, and

265
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
they have to get this mucous cleared
from their lungs periodically.

266
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
And they also often have to have
respirators to allow them to breath.

267
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
OK.  So that's some examples of
autosomal recessive diseases.

268
00:22:08 --> 00:22:13
Let's think about the genetics.
And we'll talk about CF

269
00:22:13 --> 00:22:17
specifically.  Let's imagine the
disease allele of CF.

270
00:22:17 --> 00:22:22
We'll call it CFD.  There are
actually many different disease

271
00:22:22 --> 00:22:26
alleles for this disease,
but we'll just lump them together.

272
00:22:26 --> 00:22:33
Here are two individuals with this

273
00:22:33 --> 00:22:41
genotype.  Do these individuals
manifest the disease?

274
00:22:41 --> 00:22:49
Yes or no?  Do they manifest the
disease?  No, because this is an

275
00:22:49 --> 00:22:58
autosomal recessive disease and they
have a wild type copy.

276
00:22:58 --> 00:23:03
But if we think about the offspring
that they could produce,

277
00:23:03 --> 00:23:09
this individual will produce gametes
that carry the D allele and the wild

278
00:23:09 --> 00:23:15
type allele, likewise this
individual, the D allele and the

279
00:23:15 --> 00:23:21
wild type allele,
such that the offspring will either

280
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
be DD, wild type D,
wild type, wild type or wild type,

281
00:23:27 --> 00:23:32
D.  Right?
So you'll have one wild type,

282
00:23:32 --> 00:23:37
wild type individual produced out of
such a cross.  And this individual

283
00:23:37 --> 00:23:42
now has no disease allele present.
This individual is both

284
00:23:42 --> 00:23:47
genotypically and phenotypically
normal.  No more issues about cystic

285
00:23:47 --> 00:23:52
fibrosis for this person or his or
her descendants.

286
00:23:52 --> 00:23:57
There will be two individuals who
are heterozygous,

287
00:23:57 --> 00:24:02
and these individuals are carriers.
They don't have the disease but they

288
00:24:02 --> 00:24:07
do have a mutant allele.
So depending on whom they marry,

289
00:24:07 --> 00:24:12
I shouldn't generalize, depending on
whom they have children with they

290
00:24:12 --> 00:24:17
may or may not have to worry about
the fact that they have a mutant CF

291
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
allele.  And one,
on average, out of four will have

292
00:24:22 --> 00:24:28
two disease alleles and
develop CF.  OK?

293
00:24:28 --> 00:24:38
So we're going to now think about

294
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
these diseases in inheritance
looking at pedigrees,

295
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
which I think are probably familiar
to most of you.

296
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
They're described in your book as
well.  But I just want to make sure

297
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
you understand what the symbols mean
before we get into it.

298
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
Females are represented as circles.
Males are represented as squares.

299
00:24:58 --> 00:25:03
Seems appropriate.
Lines between them represent a

300
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
mating, they have mated.
And the offspring are represented

301
00:25:09 --> 00:25:21
below.

302
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
If the symbol is left open then the
individual is normal,

303
00:25:27 --> 00:25:34
genotypically and phenotypically.
If the individual has a shaded

304
00:25:34 --> 00:25:41
symbol they are affected,
they show disease symptoms.

305
00:25:41 --> 00:25:48
And if the symbol is partially
shaded, I usually fill in half the

306
00:25:48 --> 00:25:55
symbol, the book will sometimes put
a little circle inside the circle

307
00:25:55 --> 00:26:02
then they are carriers.
They're heterozygous carriers.

308
00:26:02 --> 00:26:07
OK?  So let's look and think about
this example up here.

309
00:26:07 --> 00:26:13
We talked about two individuals who
were both heterozygous for the

310
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
disease allele,
so they were carriers.

311
00:26:19 --> 00:26:25
Their genotype was CFD,
CF wild type.

312
00:26:25 --> 00:26:32
They mated.  They had

313
00:26:32 --> 00:26:42
four children.

314
00:26:42 --> 00:26:46
There were four possible genotypes,
rather three possible genotypes.

315
00:26:46 --> 00:26:51
And, in fact, we observe all three
genotypes in this generation.

316
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
We have one individual over here who
doesn't have her symbol filled.

317
00:26:55 --> 00:27:00
We have another whose symbol is
fully filled.

318
00:27:00 --> 00:27:08
And then we have two whose symbols
are partially filled.

319
00:27:08 --> 00:27:16
What's the genotype of this
individual?  Wild type,

320
00:27:16 --> 00:27:24
wild type.  This one?  D,
D.  This one?  D, wild type.

321
00:27:24 --> 00:27:32
And this one?  Same thing.  OK?
So that's what pedigrees look like.

322
00:27:32 --> 00:27:37
Let me show you a larger pedigree
and give you some of the rules that

323
00:27:37 --> 00:27:43
apply to autosomal recessive
diseases.  So here's a large

324
00:27:43 --> 00:27:49
pedigree involving an autosomal
recessive gene,

325
00:27:49 --> 00:27:55
disease gene.  Again,
the two parents are heterozygous.

326
00:27:55 --> 00:28:01
They had many, many offspring all
here.  Roughly a quarter of them

327
00:28:01 --> 00:28:07
will carry both copies of the
disease gene and develop disease.

328
00:28:07 --> 00:28:11
Among the rest there will be
unaffected individuals but of two

329
00:28:11 --> 00:28:16
classes, ones that don't have the
disease gene at all and ones who are

330
00:28:16 --> 00:28:20
heterozygous carriers.
Two-thirds of those unaffected

331
00:28:20 --> 00:28:25
offspring are themselves carriers,
two-thirds.  Two-thirds of the

332
00:28:25 --> 00:28:30
unaffected offspring are
themselves carriers.

333
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
Among those half of the offspring of
a carrier are themselves carriers,

334
00:28:34 --> 00:28:39
as shown here.  So if this
individual came to you at a genetics

335
00:28:39 --> 00:28:44
clinic and wanted to know what is my
likelihood of carrying the D mutant

336
00:28:44 --> 00:28:49
allele, you'd be able to say,
without knowing the genotype of his

337
00:28:49 --> 00:28:54
mother you would be able to say that
it's half of a half

338
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
or a quarter.  OK?
Now, every once in a while two

339
00:28:58 --> 00:29:02
affected individuals,
two homozygotes have children,

340
00:29:02 --> 00:29:06
as shown here.  And you can see in
that scenario all of the offspring

341
00:29:06 --> 00:29:09
have disease because the only
alleles that are present are the

342
00:29:09 --> 00:29:13
mutant alleles.
That has to be true because these

343
00:29:13 --> 00:29:17
are both affected,
and therefore all of the offspring

344
00:29:17 --> 00:29:21
will also only inherit mutant
alleles and develop the disease

345
00:29:21 --> 00:29:25
themselves.  OK?
And importantly because the disease

346
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
gene is coming in on chromosomes 1
to 22, one of those and not the X or

347
00:29:31 --> 00:29:37
the Y, there is no gender
associations here.

348
00:29:37 --> 00:29:43
Mothers can pass the disease to
their daughters and their sons.

349
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
Fathers can pass the disease to
their daughters and their sons.

350
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
There are no gender associations
with this scenario.

351
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
OK.  Disease alleles are present in
different frequencies in the

352
00:29:58 --> 00:30:02
population.  Some of them are
extremely rare,

353
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
but some of them are actually rather
common.

354
00:30:06 --> 00:30:16
So we're talking about the allele

355
00:30:16 --> 00:30:21
frequency, the percentage of alleles
among all of our chromosomes that

356
00:30:21 --> 00:30:27
are the disease type.
For PKU it depends a lot on where

357
00:30:27 --> 00:30:34
you're from.
For example, in Turkey it's actually

358
00:30:34 --> 00:30:42
rather common,
one in 206,000 alleles of this gene

359
00:30:42 --> 00:30:51
are mutant in this population,
but in Japan it's much less common.

360
00:30:51 --> 00:31:00
One in 220,000 Japanese carry this
allele.

361
00:31:00 --> 00:31:04
Exactly why this is we're not
entirely sure,

362
00:31:04 --> 00:31:08
although I'll give you some
speculation in a little while about

363
00:31:08 --> 00:31:13
what controls the frequency of these
actually rather deleterious alleles.

364
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
CF is fairly frequent.  One in 25
alleles are CF.

365
00:31:17 --> 00:31:22
One in 25.  There are as maybe 200
of you in this room,

366
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
so that's some number of mutant
alleles among you.  It's

367
00:31:26 --> 00:31:31
a fairly high number.
You're sitting there carrying a

368
00:31:31 --> 00:31:37
mutant copy of the CF allele.
This is actually relevant to

369
00:31:37 --> 00:31:42
European descendancy.
I'm not entirely sure whether it

370
00:31:42 --> 00:31:48
applies to all descendencies but
let's just say that it's roughly

371
00:31:48 --> 00:31:53
that number.  And another disease
that you might have heard of

372
00:31:53 --> 00:31:59
Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population --

373
00:31:59 --> 00:32:08
-- is also quite common.

374
00:32:08 --> 00:32:13
One in 25. It's so common,
in fact, that in certain parts of

375
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
the world individuals undergo
genetic testing before they decide

376
00:32:19 --> 00:32:24
whom to date because they want to
avoid the risk that they're going to

377
00:32:24 --> 00:32:30
date somebody else who carries
such a mutation.

378
00:32:30 --> 00:32:33
This is actually a very horrible
disease.  I shouldn't joke about it.

379
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
So they want to avoid ever having
to face the problem of having a

380
00:32:37 --> 00:32:41
child who has Tay-Sachs disease.
So they undergo, in a sense,

381
00:32:41 --> 00:32:45
pre-marriage counseling to figure
out their genotype to decide whether

382
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
or not to date.
And you can also imagine with

383
00:32:49 --> 00:32:53
similar tests we could figure out
whether or not individuals carry

384
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57
mutations in these genes to let them
know what their risks of developing

385
00:32:57 --> 00:33:01
disease are or whether or not to
maintain a pregnancy of a child who

386
00:33:01 --> 00:33:05
may or may not be affected
and so on.

387
00:33:05 --> 00:33:09
So they're very serious societal
implications for these kinds of

388
00:33:09 --> 00:33:14
disease alleles.
Now, some of the alleles are very

389
00:33:14 --> 00:33:18
rare.  Here's one example in the
Japanese population of PKU.

390
00:33:18 --> 00:33:23
The likelihood that two individuals
would randomly get together who had

391
00:33:23 --> 00:33:27
mutant alleles of a phenylalanine
hydroxylase gene and have a child is

392
00:33:27 --> 00:33:32
exceedingly small.
And so in these situations,

393
00:33:32 --> 00:33:37
where the allele frequency is
extremely rare,

394
00:33:37 --> 00:33:42
when you find an affected individual
it's almost always a sure sign of

395
00:33:42 --> 00:33:47
inbreeding.  Consanguinity is the
term used in genetics where cousins

396
00:33:47 --> 00:33:52
or other relatives marry and have
children.  And since they are

397
00:33:52 --> 00:33:57
related and have a higher allele
frequency within their families of a

398
00:33:57 --> 00:34:02
particular allele then the
likelihood that they'll have an

399
00:34:02 --> 00:34:07
offspring who has two copies of the
allele is much higher.

400
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
And so when you see a pattern such
as this, it's a fairly clear

401
00:34:11 --> 00:34:16
indication that you're dealing with
an autosomal recessive disease

402
00:34:16 --> 00:34:21
involving consanguineous mating.
Here are two cousins who are

403
00:34:21 --> 00:34:26
producing offspring both of whom are
affected.  And when you see a

404
00:34:26 --> 00:34:31
pattern like this you can actually
figure out, or at least figure out

405
00:34:31 --> 00:34:36
pretty well who were the carriers in
this scenario,

406
00:34:36 --> 00:34:41
who were the carriers in this family.
Since both, since the children have

407
00:34:41 --> 00:34:46
two mutant copies then both of their
parents must be heterozygous

408
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
carriers.  OK?
That goes without saying.

409
00:34:50 --> 00:34:55
They're heterozygous.  Since this
individual is heterozygous and the

410
00:34:55 --> 00:35:00
allele was passed on from their
grandparents then his mother must

411
00:35:00 --> 00:35:05
also carry the allele inherited from
one of the two grandparents.

412
00:35:05 --> 00:35:09
Likewise this woman's father must
carry the mutant allele.

413
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
And in this generation we actually
don't know whether it's the male or

414
00:35:13 --> 00:35:17
the female who carries the mutation.
It could be either.  And it's been

415
00:35:17 --> 00:35:22
passed along to both sides of this
family tree and reduced to

416
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
homozygocity in this generation.
OK?  You can also begin to figure

417
00:35:26 --> 00:35:30
out what the likelihood of other
members of the family tree

418
00:35:30 --> 00:35:35
is being heterozygous.
So this individual here has a one in

419
00:35:35 --> 00:35:39
two chance. One of these two parents
is definitely a heterozygote,

420
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
and so the likelihood that he's a
heterozygote is one in two.

421
00:35:43 --> 00:35:47
And among his children you could
say they have a one in four chance.

422
00:35:47 --> 00:35:51
If he has a one in two chance then
there's a one in two chance that

423
00:35:51 --> 00:35:55
he'll pass it onto them,
so overall there's a one in four

424
00:35:55 --> 00:35:59
chance that they will be
themselves carriers.

425
00:35:59 --> 00:36:03
And this, again,
this kind of genetic testing is done

426
00:36:03 --> 00:36:07
frequently to figure out what your
relative risk of developing a

427
00:36:07 --> 00:36:11
particular disease are.
Now, as I said, for other disease

428
00:36:11 --> 00:36:16
alleles like CF and Tay-Sachs,
the allele frequency is actually

429
00:36:16 --> 00:36:20
strikingly high.
And yet if you're homozygous for

430
00:36:20 --> 00:36:24
these mutations you're dead.
Not necessarily right away but not

431
00:36:24 --> 00:36:28
for very long.
It clearly reduces your

432
00:36:28 --> 00:36:33
reproductive fitness.
And so why would these alleles be

433
00:36:33 --> 00:36:37
present in our population at all?
Why wouldn't they be removed

434
00:36:37 --> 00:36:41
through natural selection?
We're not going to get into this in

435
00:36:41 --> 00:36:45
great detail, but there are theories
out there and some evidence to

436
00:36:45 --> 00:36:49
support them that there might be
actually an advantage in certain

437
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
circumstances for being heterozygous
wild type over mutant.

438
00:36:53 --> 00:36:57
And there are theories both related
to Tay-Sachs disease,

439
00:36:57 --> 00:37:01
sickle cell disease and cystic
fibrosis such that if you are

440
00:37:01 --> 00:37:05
heterozygous you actually survive
better in the face of certain

441
00:37:05 --> 00:37:10
pathogenic exposure than do people
who are wild type for both alleles.

442
00:37:10 --> 00:37:14
And that's the argument for why
these alleles actually built up,

443
00:37:14 --> 00:37:19
at least in the past, over the
evolution of our species.

444
00:37:19 --> 00:37:24
OK.  Let's transition now to
autosomal dominant diseases.

445
00:37:24 --> 00:37:29
This is a famous example,
Huntington's disease,

446
00:37:29 --> 00:37:33
otherwise called Huntington's chorea.
Relatively rare.

447
00:37:33 --> 00:37:37
About one in 10,
00 to 25,000 individuals affected.

448
00:37:37 --> 00:37:41
It exhibits an autosomal dominant
pattern of inheritance,

449
00:37:41 --> 00:37:45
as you'll see in a moment.
The age of onset is about 35 to 40

450
00:37:45 --> 00:37:49
years of age.  These individuals
actually are totally normal for the

451
00:37:49 --> 00:37:53
first three to four decades.
You wouldn't know that they had a

452
00:37:53 --> 00:37:57
disease.  But starting at that time
they begin to develop symptoms which

453
00:37:57 --> 00:38:01
involve both effects on their
personalities but more importantly

454
00:38:01 --> 00:38:05
effects on their movements.
That's what you first begin to see.

455
00:38:05 --> 00:38:09
That's what chorea means.  It's
sort of this dance-like movement.

456
00:38:09 --> 00:38:14
And then that gets much, much more
severe and stereotypical.

457
00:38:14 --> 00:38:18
And eventually, in addition to that,
there's death of cells in the brain.

458
00:38:18 --> 00:38:23
And the combination of these
affects leads to the death of the

459
00:38:23 --> 00:38:28
individual by about the fourth or
fifth decade of life.

460
00:38:28 --> 00:38:32
This is actually a movie of an
individual who has Huntington's

461
00:38:32 --> 00:38:37
disease.
He's being told to hold his arms

462
00:38:37 --> 00:38:41
straight out, but because of this
neurogenerative process that's

463
00:38:41 --> 00:38:46
taking place within his brain and
also other parts of his nervous

464
00:38:46 --> 00:38:50
system he's unable to do so.
And this is sort of the

465
00:38:50 --> 00:38:55
stereotypical presentation of
Huntington's chorea.

466
00:38:55 --> 00:38:59
They have this wave-like movement
and also their limbs get stuck in

467
00:38:59 --> 00:39:04
particular postures,
as you can see this individual here.

468
00:39:04 --> 00:39:07
At the molecular level the problem
in these individuals is that their

469
00:39:07 --> 00:39:11
brain cells are dying,
particular ones, actually,

470
00:39:11 --> 00:39:14
within a particular region of the
brain surrounding this ventricle

471
00:39:14 --> 00:39:18
here.  And this is a normal space in
a normal brain.

472
00:39:18 --> 00:39:22
And there are various sets of
neurons on either side of those

473
00:39:22 --> 00:39:25
ventricles.  And in HD patients
those cells are progressively lost

474
00:39:25 --> 00:39:29
over time, and when those cells are
lost you lose motor control and you

475
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
also develop rather
severe dementia.

476
00:39:33 --> 00:39:37
And the reason that those cells are
being lost is that the mutant

477
00:39:37 --> 00:39:41
protein, the mutant form of this
protein called Huntington,

478
00:39:41 --> 00:39:45
the mutant form builds up inside of
those cells and aggregates and

479
00:39:45 --> 00:39:49
causes the cells to die.
OK?  And this is why this is an

480
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
autosomal dominant disease.
If you have the disease allele then

481
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
you will get the aggregation of the
protein and you will develop

482
00:39:57 --> 00:40:07
the disease.

483
00:40:07 --> 00:40:14
So let's take another example of a
cross between an individual who is

484
00:40:14 --> 00:40:22
normal, two normal copies of HD and
an individual who has a disease

485
00:40:22 --> 00:40:30
allele and a wild type allele who is
heterozygous.  Is this

486
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
individual diseased?
He either is already or he will be

487
00:40:36 --> 00:40:40
in the case of HD.
It's an autosomal dominant disease.

488
00:40:40 --> 00:40:44
If you have the disease allele you
will develop disease.

489
00:40:44 --> 00:40:48
If we look at a Punnett Square,
this individual will always transmit

490
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53
the wild type allele,
this individual will transmit the

491
00:40:53 --> 00:40:57
mutant allele half the time the wild
type allele of the other.

492
00:40:57 --> 00:41:01
These individuals will be wild type
D, wild type D,

493
00:41:01 --> 00:41:06
wild type, wild type,
wild type, wild type.

494
00:41:06 --> 00:41:13
So you'll get half diseased,
half normal.  OK?  A rather

495
00:41:13 --> 00:41:21
different picture than we saw
previously.  And importantly,

496
00:41:21 --> 00:41:29
as I mentioned, the presence, the
mere presence of the D allele leads

497
00:41:29 --> 00:41:37
to the production of
this toxic protein.

498
00:41:37 --> 00:41:43
And ultimately brain damage.
And that's why it's dominant.

499
00:41:43 --> 00:41:49
OK.  So let's look at a pedigree of
an autosomal dominant disorder.

500
00:41:49 --> 00:41:55
Here's an affected individual, a
female who marries,

501
00:41:55 --> 00:42:02
who has children with an unaffected
male.

502
00:42:02 --> 00:42:06
They have four children.
On average half of them will

503
00:42:06 --> 00:42:10
inherit the defective allele and
therefore develop disease.

504
00:42:10 --> 00:42:14
Half of the offspring of an
affected parent will be affected.

505
00:42:14 --> 00:42:19
Importantly, the unaffected
offspring of an affected parent have

506
00:42:19 --> 00:42:23
unaffected offspring.
If you are normal, you do not

507
00:42:23 --> 00:42:27
inherit the disease allele,
you're scot-free. Your children will

508
00:42:27 --> 00:42:32
no longer have to worry
about this disease.

509
00:42:32 --> 00:42:35
But in this case,
in this individual,

510
00:42:35 --> 00:42:38
again roughly half, in this example
two-thirds of the offspring do

511
00:42:38 --> 00:42:42
develop the disease.
This is another really important

512
00:42:42 --> 00:42:45
case of genetic testing.
This guy might have wanted to know

513
00:42:45 --> 00:42:49
that he was going to develop
Huntington's disease in order to

514
00:42:49 --> 00:42:52
decide whether to have children in
the first place.

515
00:42:52 --> 00:42:55
This individual here likewise might
want to know before the disease

516
00:42:55 --> 00:42:59
actually manifested itself what
would happen in order to make

517
00:42:59 --> 00:43:02
lifestyle decisions.
Am I going to quit work and have a

518
00:43:02 --> 00:43:06
good time for the next ten years?
Because pretty soon I'm actually

519
00:43:06 --> 00:43:10
not going to be able to.
So genetic testing actually can

520
00:43:10 --> 00:43:13
make an extremely important set of
decisions for individuals affected

521
00:43:13 --> 00:43:17
in this way.  And there's actually a
subtlety here,

522
00:43:17 --> 00:43:20
too.  Sometimes people don't want to
know because there's actually

523
00:43:20 --> 00:43:24
nothing to be done for them.
In the case of Huntington's disease

524
00:43:24 --> 00:43:28
that's true.  We don't
have a cure for it.

525
00:43:28 --> 00:43:32
So Arlo Guthrie who is the son of
Woody Guthrie,

526
00:43:32 --> 00:43:36
who died of Huntington's disease,
apparently doesn't want to know

527
00:43:36 --> 00:43:40
because if he learns that he's going
to get it he's just going to be

528
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
depressed.  If he learns that he
didn't get it he might be relieved,

529
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
but he doesn't want to take that
chance so he's just leading life in

530
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
hopes that he doesn't have the
disease allele.

531
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
Now, I actually don't know in his
case whether he has children or not.

532
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00
He has children, so he actually
made that decision almost for his

533
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
children as well.
So important implications for these

534
00:44:04 --> 00:44:09
kinds of genetic diseases.
Now, here's an interesting pattern

535
00:44:09 --> 00:44:14
that I want to share with you.
And this relates to a phenomenon

536
00:44:14 --> 00:44:30
called penetrance.

537
00:44:30 --> 00:44:34
Penetrance.  Penetrance is a number
which reflects the percentage of

538
00:44:34 --> 00:44:38
individuals who have the disease
genotype who end up getting the

539
00:44:38 --> 00:44:43
disease.  I've been telling you
about examples where that's 100%.

540
00:44:43 --> 00:44:47
If you have the disease genotype
you get the disease.

541
00:44:47 --> 00:44:51
But that's not always true.
Sometimes you can have the disease

542
00:44:51 --> 00:44:56
genotype, but because of other
factors like environmental factors,

543
00:44:56 --> 00:45:00
what you eat, what you get exposed
to you actually don't

544
00:45:00 --> 00:45:05
develop the disease.
Or maybe you just got lucky because

545
00:45:05 --> 00:45:09
some of these diseases are
stochastic in nature.

546
00:45:09 --> 00:45:13
And you might have been one of the
lucky ones.  That would be an

547
00:45:13 --> 00:45:17
example of lack of penetrance.
You have the disease genotype but

548
00:45:17 --> 00:45:21
you don't have the disease itself.
And this can lead to the

549
00:45:21 --> 00:45:25
development of individuals in
pedigrees, such as the one I'm going

550
00:45:25 --> 00:45:30
to show you, who are obligate
carriers, obligate carriers.

551
00:45:30 --> 00:45:34
We call them obligate carriers
because they have a child who is

552
00:45:34 --> 00:45:39
affected but they themselves were
not affected.  And they have a

553
00:45:39 --> 00:45:43
parent who likewise was affected.
So the simplest explanation for a

554
00:45:43 --> 00:45:48
pedigree such as this is that this
mother passed along the disease

555
00:45:48 --> 00:45:52
allele to her daughter but she did
not manifest the disease,

556
00:45:52 --> 00:45:57
an example of lack of penetrance,
but she still had the disease allele

557
00:45:57 --> 00:46:02
which she passed onto her daughter
who developed disease.

558
00:46:02 --> 00:46:05
OK?  And we call these individuals
obligate carriers.

559
00:46:05 --> 00:46:09
Even though they don't manifest the
disease they must be carriers.

560
00:46:09 --> 00:46:12
And in that sense this circle
should be shaded.

561
00:46:12 --> 00:46:16
We haven't shaded it because
actually there are other

562
00:46:16 --> 00:46:20
explanations for how you can get
this pattern.  Sometimes,

563
00:46:20 --> 00:46:23
for example, the disease is such
that there are non-familial forms of

564
00:46:23 --> 00:46:27
the disease which complicate the
analysis.  Heart disease is a good

565
00:46:27 --> 00:46:31
example.  There are familial forms
of heart disease and there is

566
00:46:31 --> 00:46:34
sporadic heart disease.
Maybe this woman doesn't have the

567
00:46:34 --> 00:46:38
predisposing mutation and her
daughter just developed heart

568
00:46:38 --> 00:46:42
disease.  That can happen.
Another example is that maybe she

569
00:46:42 --> 00:46:45
picked up a new mutation.
Her mother is actually clean but

570
00:46:45 --> 00:46:49
she picked up her own mutation in
the development of the sperm or egg

571
00:46:49 --> 00:46:53
that gave rise to her,
and then she has the disease.

572
00:46:53 --> 00:46:57
That would be rare but not
unprecedented.

573
00:46:57 --> 00:47:01
And the final example,
which is the most interesting,

574
00:47:01 --> 00:47:05
is so-called non-paternity or even
non-maternity.

575
00:47:05 --> 00:47:09
So we're making an assumption here
based on what the family has

576
00:47:09 --> 00:47:13
provided us in terms of this
pedigree that this girl is the

577
00:47:13 --> 00:47:17
daughter of this mating,
this woman and this man.  But about

578
00:47:17 --> 00:47:21
10% of kids born in this country
actually have a father who isn't

579
00:47:21 --> 00:47:25
their father.  It's a shocking
statistic, I know,

580
00:47:25 --> 00:47:29
but it's true.  This is called
non-paternity.

581
00:47:29 --> 00:47:34
So it might be the case that this
woman actually doesn't have the

582
00:47:34 --> 00:47:40
mutation.  It's just that her father,
her mate, the father of this girl

583
00:47:40 --> 00:47:45
[LAUGHTER] is not that guy.
And this is sick but true, most

584
00:47:45 --> 00:47:51
often in situations like this it's
Uncle Bob or brother Steve.

585
00:47:51 --> 00:47:57
I know it's disgusting but this is
often an example,

586
00:47:57 --> 00:48:03
the explanation for examples such as
this.

587
00:48:03 --> 00:48:07
And another interesting example is
non-maternity.

588
00:48:07 --> 00:48:12
We're assuming that this is the
mother of this child but sometimes

589
00:48:12 --> 00:48:16
families don't want to admit,
for example, that this girl had a

590
00:48:16 --> 00:48:21
baby.  And so they give it to Aunt
Sue.  And now Aunt Sue's child gets

591
00:48:21 --> 00:48:25
the disease, but it's not because of
Aunt Sue's genes.

592
00:48:25 --> 00:48:30
It's because of her cousin.
OK?  So here are some examples.

593
00:48:30 --> 00:48:33
Now, I have one more minute,
and I need to riffle through the

594
00:48:33 --> 00:48:37
slides because I'm going to leave
you for a few days.

595
00:48:37 --> 00:48:40
And I want to just remind you that
there are X linked diseases that

596
00:48:40 --> 00:48:44
affect, that are both dominant and
recessive.  Most of them are

597
00:48:44 --> 00:48:48
recessive.  And here's a classic
example, an X linked recessive

598
00:48:48 --> 00:48:51
disease involving hemophilia in the
royal families of Europe.

599
00:48:51 --> 00:48:55
Importantly, when you look at X
linked disease pedigrees,

600
00:48:55 --> 00:48:58
and here's Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, another familiar disease,

601
00:48:58 --> 00:49:02
again X linked recessive, there are
certain rules that dictate the

602
00:49:02 --> 00:49:06
development of the disease
over the generations.

603
00:49:06 --> 00:49:10
They're summarized here.
And you should look in your book

604
00:49:10 --> 00:49:15
for more information.
And, finally, there are rare

605
00:49:15 --> 00:49:19
examples of X linked dominant
diseases, and their rules of

606
00:49:19 --> 00:49:24
inheritance are somewhat different.
So you should familiarize yourself

607
00:49:24 --> 00:49:27
with X linked modes of inheritance.
