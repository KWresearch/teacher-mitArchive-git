Transcript â€“ Lecture 27 

All right.  So let me move onto the last lecture in this module.  Not in the module. 
In the last lecture in the nervous system part of the systems module.  And I want 
to start by talking briefly about learning and memory, very briefly about learning 
and memory. 

We talked last time about setting up synapses, we talked about making 
connections between the wires, and we talked about how changes in membrane 
potential could either determine whether a synapse fired or whether it did not. 
However, there's more to it than that.  There is significant data that indicates that 
the more often you use a synapse the strong that synapse will become.  What do 
I mean by stronger? 

Well, I'm actually not sure what I mean by stronger, except in a couple of cases 
that I'll tell you about.  So the term I want to, so synaptic connections, this is 
going to be long.  Synaptic connections strengthen with use. 

And the phenomenon I want to tell you about is long-term potentiation or long-
term depression. 

And this is a phenomenon that was discovered in neurons that were studied in 
isolation.  So it's very difficult, it's impossible to study neurons within the brain of 
any complex animal, especially mammals.  And so what's done is to use so-
called slice cultures. 

Where you take a slice out of the brain, a very thin slice that's just got a few 
layers of cells, and you look and see what these neurons do in some kind of 
plastic tissue culture dish with media.  And they actually do quite a bit.  The 
neurons fire and they make synapses.  And a lot has been learned with them, 
with these kind of slice cultures.  So here's the deal. 

If one has a cell, if you look at this picture here, if one has a cell and one 
stimulates the synapse you see that there is a response to the first stimulus.  And 
you're actually measuring change in potential in the cell.  Let's not worry about 
how the experiment was done because we're not going to get through the 
material I want to cover today.  You can come see me in office hours and I'll 
explain to you.  What I want to point out is that after a first stimulus there is a 
change in the potential of the responding cell. 

If you continue to give that stimulus, you get a much stronger response later on. 
So the strength of the response, the change in membrane potential in a 
responding cell increases with stimulation of that presynaptic cell, of that 
synapse.  And that is what long-term potentiation is.  It increases the chances 
that the postsynaptic cell will fire. 

And it is believed that long-term potentiation has got a profound role in memory 
and in learning.  So how does that actually work?  Well, it's not clear in most 
cases, but this is an example from your book that is the shining example of how 
learning and memory can work at the molecular level.  And it has to do with 
glutamate.  You do not have this on today's handout.  It was on your last lecture's 
in-class handout. 

But you can look up here and then go back to your last lecture's handout if you 
don't have it with you.  It has to do with glutamate.  So glutamate is the major 
excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.  And glutamate 
activates two different ionotropic receptors.  One of them is called the AMPA or 
the non-NMDA receptor and the other is called the NMDA receptor. 

With low level of stimulation or with single stimulation of a presynaptic neuron the 
AMPA receptors are activated.  And these are sodium channels, so these are 
ionotropic channels.  And glutamate is released, binds to the AMPA ion channel, 
changes its confirmation, and you get an influx of sodium, and therefore get 
closer to threshold potential.  However, on the same synapse, like right next door 
are these other receptors called the NMDA receptors.  And they are not used if 
the presynaptic cell is stimulated at a low level or infrequently. 

But if you keep stimulating that presynaptic cell, eventually these NMDA 
receptors will open.  And they will open and they will allow an influx of both 
calcium and sodium.  And what happens is that you get a much stronger change 
in potential because you've got now two sets of receptors open. 

And this postsynaptic cell is much more likely to fire and is actually much more 
stable in the synapses that it has made.  So this NMDA channel only open after 
repeated stimulation.  So that's an example of what repeated stimulation can do 
to changing channels.  And there is some molecular data, although it's really not 
complete, as to why you switch this channel usage.  One thing, however, that's 
very interesting about long-term potentiation, and indeed about learning and 
memory anyway, is that you need --

-- protein synthesis for learning especially.  For classical learning, the kind of 
learning that you do before a test, the kind of learning that a mouse does to find 
its way through a maze repeatedly requires protein synthesis.  And this is very 
interesting because what I've been telling you about in this module is stuff that 
happens in the neuron that is actually independent of transcription or protein 
synthesis. 

It involves changes in gene activity.  It can involve changes in gene regulation, as 
I'll talk about in a moment, but it does not actually require any transcription or 
protein synthesis per se.  Learning and memory of the classical kind that we think 
about does.  And it's one of the reasons that you need to get a few hours sleep 
before you take a test. 

It's one of the reasons if you pull an all-nighter, and there are many, you do not 
do that well the next day because you need this round of protein synthesis that 
does stuff that probably synthesizes new receptors that allows the synaptic 
connections you've made through your learning to be strengthened.  And that's 
still a mystery, really, as to what the protein synthesis is required for.  But if 
you're interested, this work from [Ed Plezia?] that I mentioned at the beginning of 
class has shed some really fascinating light on it.  So come see me if you want 
to.  All right. 

So I want to move on now to circuitry.  All right.  I'll show you this slide because 
it's up there.  This is a piece of data that I pulled down that's kind of interesting. 
This looks at the AMPA NMDA ratio, receptor ratio with cocaine.  So in a control 
there are about the same number of AMPA and NMDA receptors on a particular 
synapse.  It's very interesting in some studies with cocaine use, you see the 
amount of the AMPA receptor. 

That is the receptor that is the short-term receptor increases relative to the 
NMDA ratio, an NMDA receptor level, indicating that with cocaine you might not 
be as good at learning as without cocaine.  It is not clear.  There are a lot of 
studies like this and the interpretations of them are complicated, but this is a solid 
piece of data that you do change the ratio of the non-NMDA and the NMDA 
receptors. 

All right.  So let's move on.  So let's talk about circuitry.  We've talked about the 
wires, the passage of current along the wires, we've talked about the connections 
between the wires, and now I want to talk about the circuits.  And I want to start 
by asking you a question.  In thinking about your brain and how much of your 
brain you used in circuitry, how many of you were taught that you use one-tenth 
of your brain? 

Raise your hands.  I want to see what you've been taught at schools.  It's no 
reflection on your teachers.  It's OK.  Thank you.  It's a substantial portion.  I feel 
that it is my duty as your professor to debunk that myth once and for all forever. 
It's not true.  And you might want to actually email your high school teachers and 
tell them it's not true.  OK.  And you perhaps even learned about the boy who 
used, you know, one-fifth of his brain and was an unbelievable genius. 

There is, none of this, I was taught that as well, and it is absolutely untrue.  And 
the data for it is very solid.  For example, any neurosurgeon who goes into your 

brain knows that no matter what part of the brain he or she goes through to 
remove your brain tumor or do whatever it is, is going to damage some aspect of 
your brain function.  Anyone who has any kind of stroke, any kind of brain 
hemorrhage, any kind of leakage of blood into the brain is going to have some 
kind of deficit.  It might be a small one or not. 

But there is ample evidence that you use all your brain.  And, indeed, why would 
one go to the trouble of making a brain that is so large if one was not using it? 
So there we go.  Let me talk a little bit about circuitry.  To indicate the complexity 
of circuitry in your brain let me point out what parts of your brain it takes to put 
together language.  If you're looking at words, it takes this area right at the back 
of your brain, the base of your brain. 

Listening to words takes a different region.  Speaking words takes a different 
region.  Generating words take different regions.  And these are very, these are 
PET scans.  We can talk about what they are.  They measure the energy usage 
in your brain.  And these are very, very large parts of your brain.  OK?  These are 
millions, close to billions of neurons involved in each part of working with 
language.  OK?  And you can go to your brain and you can actually, people have 
mapped these quite finely. 

So the circuitry in your brain is enormous, and the effort to both set up and 
maintain the circuitry is enormous.  Here is another interesting piece of 
information.  About 20% to 25% of all the energy that you use is used by your 
brain, which is one of the reasons you probably need to sleep.  It's not clear why 
we need to sleep.  But it is a tremendous, there takes a tremendous amount of 
effort to get the wiring set up and to keep the wiring set up and to keep the 
circuitry running. 

Here's another example of circuitry that I'm going to come back to.  It's called a 
retinotopic map.  And I'm going to start talking about it by addressing the 
question of how the circuitry in your nervous system is set up in the first place. 
And I'm going to use this as an example throughout the rest of the class. 

So when people realized way back when that there were circuits set up in the 
nervous system, the question was how did these circuits get set up?  How did 
neurons know which connections to make?  And there were two competing 
theories. 

One I'm going to call the random/survival theory.  They've got lots of names in 
the literature, but I call it the random/survival theory. 

And the notion here was that neurons grow all over the place, and if they make 
connections that work, if they're productive connections, those connections will 
be maintained, the neurons will survive, and there you go.  You have your circuit. 

The other theory is the guidance theory, that there's actually something telling the 
neurons where to go. 

And I'll show you a piece of data that suggested that this guidance theory was 
really correct.  But today, in fact, both of these theories seem to be correct when 
put together in a way I'll try to build up for you.  So your eye, your eye and your 
visual system are very complex.  Your eye starts off sort of like a camera, but 
very rapidly that analogy breaks down. 

And light falls onto your retina and the photoreceptors in your retina, and from 
your retina a series of axons are bundled together to make the optic nerve, which 
goes to your brain.  And, in fact, I should point out, I'm not going to talk more 
about this, but the image that your retina sees we know quite clearly, a Nobel 
Prize was given for it, is not the image that you see when you look at me or you 
look around the room. 

It's a series of shadows and bright points and so on.  It's really not a direct 
camera image as the camera does it for us.  But that is no matter now.  What is 
important is that some set of stimuli go from your retina through the optic nerve 
back to your brain.  And they go to two places in your brain.  So here are some 
diagrams.  Let's look at the very left most one.  This isn't on your handout but 
look at it up here. 

I've got an equivalent one later on.  So in your eye, from your eye the axons from 
the eye are sent back, project back to a region in your brain called the tectum. It's 
got a lot of different names, lateral geniculate nucleus or the thalamus or the 
tectum.  OK.  We'll call it the, I think I'm calling it the tectum in this lecture.  Let 
me see.  Let me make sure I've got it correct. 

Yeah, I'm going to call it the tectum.  OK?  So we'll talk about the tectum.  And 
from the tectum connect synapses are made, another set of neurons go back to 
another region of your brain called the visual cortex.  And it's the summation of all 
these different connections that somehow allows you to interpret what you see 
and see it.  It's extremely complicated.  What I want to concentrate on are the 
connections between the retina and the tectum. 

And what's interesting in ourselves and any animals that see binocularly, that can 
see 3-dimensionally, is that the reason you can see in 3D is that some of the 
neurons that come from your right eye go to the right side of the brain and some 
of them go to the left side of the brain and vise versa.  Some of the neurons on 
the left side of your brain go to the left side, yeah, and some of them go to the 
right side.  And so if you look in some, just look at the diagram so you're with me. 

If you look in some, you'll see that some of the neurons go to the same side and 
some cross over and go to the other side.  OK.  So you can look at this in a 
different way.  This very beautifully labeling experiment where you can actually 

label neurons in different parts of the retina, and you can follow where they go. 
The label is maintained in their axons.  And as the axons, well, I'll talk about in a 
moment. 

As the axons send out their processes back into, oh, I've called it the thalamus 
here, back into the thalamus then you can see those same axons.  So let's look 
here.  This is the left eye and the right eye.  What?  The left eye and the right 
eye.  OK.  And let's look here at the images that you're going to get here on the 
left side, the connections you're going to get on the left side of your brain that will 
give you binocular vision in your right visual field. 

Here are a set of neurons.  They're called the nasal neurons because they're on 
the side of your retina that's next to your nose.  And these red neurons are going 
to send their axons back into the left side of the brain.  Here they are.  And the 
same time the neurons from the left eye, from the side of your eye nearest the 
outside called the temporal, are going to send their axons back to the left side or 
to a different side of this thalamus or this tectum. 

OK?  So what I want you to see is red can go to one side.  Excuse me.  The red 
here cross over when they go to that side and the green cross over and go to 
that side.  So let me diagram this more clearly so that we can actually discuss 
this with the diagram in front of you.  This is number one on your handout.  OK? 
So let's look at this and indicate it more clearly. 

These N normally in setting up binocular vision, this circle here is meant to be 
one eye, and this back here is meant to be one side of the tectum.  Let me write 
on the board that in retinal tactile mapping the tectum can also be called the 
thalamus. 

All right.  So what's important here is that these N neurons go back to this region 
of the tectum called the C.  OK?  And I see I have not wrote, I have not indicated 
tectum here or retina.  I'll go back and do it.  But you should write here, the circle 
here is the retina and this oval here is the tectum.  And then we will be together. 

So these N neurons from the retina send out axons that get to this C or caudal 
region of the tectum.  And these T neurons or temporal neurons from the retina 
send out axons that get to this R or rostral region of the tectum.  So this is a long 
preamble to tell you two things. 

Firstly, these connections are what you always see in every animal with either 
binocular or monocular vision.  Now, the way this is set up is actually quite 
confusing.  And I want to, let's not worry about the details too much, but let's look 
at, as I see it I realize it's quite confusing.  I took it from a very old paper, which I 
thought would be of interest, but as I see it here there's one point of confusion. 

But what I want to point out is an experiment that was done a long time ago by a 
guy called Roger Sperry which addressed this question of whether axons were 
guided in a particular way or whether or not they randomly found their way.  And 
then by some kind of survival cue the connections in the nervous system were 
set up.  So what Sperry did was to take this tectum and he rotated it 180 
degrees.  So the C is now 180 degrees reversed. 

And if he did that he had to break the axons that connected the normal retina and 
the tectum.  OK?  But what happened was that those axons grew back.  This was 
done in frogs and they grew back.  And there are two possible outcomes to this 
experiment.  The first is that these nasal, don't you love it? 

Thank you so much.  OK.  The first is that these nasal neurons will grow back to 
this R region, which they would not normally do, but it's far away from them so 
maybe that's how they work.  The second is that these nasal neurons will grow 
back to the C region, N to C in the same way that they would in the normal case, 
even though they're closer together. 

And the outcome of the experiment was unequivocal and it was fantastic and it 
was one of the reasons he got a Nobel Prize, which was that you always get 
these nasal neurons growing back to the C region and these temporal neurons 
growing back to the R region.  All right?  So this is a very long preamble for a 
very complex axon writing system, but the bottom line here that I want you to 
have is that these retinal neurons knew which part of the brain they had to project 
back to. 

And that was very strong evidence that there was guidance of these neurons to 
the correct region of the brain.  All right.  So let's move on to how this guidance 
takes place.  And I'm going to come back at the end to talk about survival 
because that's also an important part of this.  And the part of the cell that you 
need to know is the growth cone. 

Now, some lectures ago I gave you a lecture about 3-dimensional structure.  And 
we talked in some detail about cell migration and how cells move in a 
mechanistic sense.  What we're going to talk about now is very related to that, 
but instead of talking about a whole cell moving we're going to talk about just part 
of a cell moving.  We're going to talk about this growth cone.  So what is the 
growth cone? 

The growth cone is the axon tip.  It has both sensory function because it's got 
various receptors of the type we've talked about, more in a moment, and it also 
has motor function because it has all those actin-based microfilaments that allow 
it to move in exactly the same way that we saw the whole cell moving. 

But you remember, of course, that axons are long and they're far away from the 
cell body, so we're just talking about the axon growing now.  This is number two 

on your handout, and this is a diagram of the end of an axon in the growth cone. 
The axon's structure, the length of the axon is stabilized by microtubules.  And 
subsequent to the ending of where the microtubules are, the cell sends out a 
series of processes that are called filopodia or lamellipodia. 

I've given you the singular here.  Filopodia are thin.  Lamellipodia are fatter.  It 
doesn't matter.  And it's in these filopodia and lamellipodia that there are 
microfilaments that, you should know, are comprised of actin polymers.  And I've 
shown you also receptors on this growth cone that can bind two molecules in the 
extracellular matrix or can bind two molecules on another cell. 

OK.  This is what a growth cone really looks like.  This is a time-lapse of minutes. 
And you can see that this is a very dynamic structure.  The cell is sending out 
processes and retracting them, sending them out and retracting them.  And the 
sense that one has when one watches axons sending out their processes is that 
they really are feeling around their environment and trying to decide where they 
should go. 

I want to remind you this is a diagram from one of your previous lectures from 
Formation 4.  The processes by which the axon is moving and sending out its 
processes are exactly the same as the processes that change during 
mesenchymal cell migration, but we're just talking about sending out part of the 
membrane and not the whole cell moving.  All right.  So what is important in this 
process?  Well, what seems to be important are several things.  OK. 

And one set of things that are important are called short-range guidance cues. 
Short-range refers to how far they can work.  Whether these are diffusible 
molecules or not.  And I'll talk about long-range ones in a moment.  The 
distinction between them is a little semantic. 

But short-range guidance cues include things in the extracellular matrix and 
include things that are irrevocably stuck onto cells so that you can really only get 
interactions directly between two adjacent cells or between a cell and something 
that it is directly just opposed to.  And I want to talk about two classes of cues. 

Oh, and them I'm going to indicate later on long-range guidance cues.  So let me 
first talk about cell adhesion molecules. 

We've talked about the extracellular matrix a bunch.  Laminin, in particular, is a 
very important molecule for guiding axons through their paths to where they are 
going. 

This is a movie showing an axon.  This ought to be a movie showing an axon 
trying to decide what substrate it wants to migrate on.  Here is an axon.  There 
it's sending out its growth cone.  And this axon has been put onto a dish that's 

got two different kinds of coatings.  On the top half it's got laminin and on the 
bottom half it's got polylysine. 

And if you look at this you can see that it's sending out processes that are 
touching the polylysine, but as it goes on it decides it's really not interested in 
interacting with the polylysine and it's interested in interacting with the laminin. 
And that's where it lands up.  Other things that you should be aware of that are 
important in axon guidance in terms of cell adhesion are the molecules cadherins 
that we talked about previously. 

Now, some of these are attractive. 

In other words, axons will like to grow on a particular substrate with particular cell 
adhesive, with particular cell adhesive or cell interactions. 

So attractive cues will promote axon outgrowth.  And one can counter this with 
repulsive cues or repulsive signals which will inhibit axon outgrowth.  And this is 
going to be true both for the cell adhesion molecules I'll talk to you about and for 
other molecules later on. 

So let's move onto diffusible molecules or the longer range molecules.  OK. 

And I want to give you, to illustrate this, an example of a very beautiful axon 
guidance phenomenon. And so we're on number three on your handout.  And 
this is the example I want to discuss with you.  It has to do with two sets of 
neurons in the spinal cord and the brain that are called commissural neurons and 
trochlear neurons. 

This diagram is a section, it's a cartoon of a section through a spinal cord.  Spinal 
cord transverse section.  If you lay on the ground and someone cuts you in half, 
that way that is a transverse section.  OK?  So here's the hole in the middle of 
the spinal cord, this is the roof plate of the spinal cord nearest the skin, and 
something called the floor plate which is deepest in your body. 

The commissural axons grow from this dorsal region down towards the floor 
plate. In contrast, these trochlear axons that I've shown in blue here grow from 
the floor plate away towards the roof plate.  And this data is shown very 
beautifully by staining these cells with appropriate markers here. 

And I apologize if you're red-green color blind.  I know this is an issue, but this is 
how the stains are actually done.  These are the real colors of the stains.  So up 
here in the top of the spinal cord, these red dots are the cell bodies of neurons. 
And the green are the axons that are sending out their processes.  And these are 
the commissural axons and they are growing down, down, down towards the 
floor plate.  And actually eventually will cross to the other side of the embryo.  So 
how do these axons know where to go? 

Well, one model, one model suggests that these axons are being told where to 
go by this little region at the bottom called the floor plate.  And this was tested in 
the following way.  One can go into a developing spinal cord, and one can cut out 
different pieces of it.  So you can cut out a piece of the dorsal spinal cord and 
you can stick it close to a piece of the floor plate or you can stick it close to a 
piece of the roof plate. 

And then you can look and see what happens.  And what happens with time is 
that neurons will develop in these pieces of dorsal spinal cord.  In the case of a 
set of tissues that's got the dorsal spinal cord and the floor plate, you can see 
very clearly that axons will grow out towards the floor plate. 

However, when you have the roof plate there, the axons do not grow out from the 
spinal cord.  There's no outgrowth.  And this type of experiment indicated that the 
floor plate was attracting these commissural axons to it, and they were growing 
out because of this attraction.  And here's what a real experiment looks like. 
Here's a piece of dorsal spinal cord, here's a piece of floor plate, and here in the 
control experiment there was dorsal spinal cord. 

And this is just a chunk of tissue culture cells instead of the roof plate.  And what 
you see here are these streaks coming out from the dorsal spinal cord explants 
towards the floor plate.  And these streaks are the axons growing out.  So this is 
actually a very robust assay.  And so using this assay, some years ago Marc 
Tessier-Lavigne's lab tried to find what the floor plate was secreting to attract 
these commissural axons. 

And it was a long, hard road that involved dissecting 35, 000 chick brains in order 
to do biochemistry to get the proteins that were doing this attraction of these 
commissural axons.  But they got something in the end.  And what they got is a 
protein called netrin-1.  Panel B is a section through the spinal cord, and you 
cannot see it very well, except for this black glob at the bottom.  But what this is 
the floor plate. 

And it's been stained for netrin-1 RNA.  And you can see this netrin-1 RNA is 
only in the floor plate region.  And if you look at the protein, it's also in the floor 
plate region.  Although, it diffuses a little bit out of that region.  Is netrin-1 really 
important for making these axons grow in the right place?  Well, yes.  Because if 
you take a mouse and knock out, you genetically mutate the netrin-1 gene, the 
commissural axons don't grow properly. 

So here's a wild type mouse spinal cord, here are these axons growing down to 
the floor plate, and here is a mutant mouse that's lacking netrin-1.  And these 
commissural axons grow but they never get to the floor plate.  They don't really 
know where to go.  Now, if you look back at handout three --

-- there was something else about this floor plate region in that these trochlear 
axons were growing away from the floor plate.  And so one could construct the 
ultimate hypothesis that the floor plate was actually repelling these trochlear 
axons from growing towards it.  And it turns out that is exactly what's happened, 
and netrin-1 can act both as a chemo attractant and a chemo repellant. 

And it does so, and this is number five on your handouts.  It does so by using two 
different receptors, one of which makes it attractive to neurons and the other 
which makes it repulsive.  So here's netrin indicated as a diffusible molecule.  It 
binds to a receptor called DCC which was initially implicated in colon cancer 
called deleted in colon cancer.  It's not clear if it really is still involved in cancer or 
not. 

But here's netrin binding to its receptor.  And subsequent there are a bunch of 
signal transduction that happens that changes whether or not these axons move 
to the floor plate and whether or not they, in fact, grow out at all.  In the case of 
repulsion, it turns out that there's another receptor called unc-5.  And that makes 
a connection with the DCC receptor.  There's an interaction between the unc-5 
and the DCC receptor. 

Netrin still binds to the DCC receptor, but the net result of this is a different signal 
transduction pathway activated such that you now get repulsion of these neurons 
by activation of this duet of receptors.  So for this diffusible process, I've given 
you the example of netrin that can act both as an attractant and a repellant. 

And many, I have no idea how to spell repellant.  Repellant, I think it's got an E. 
OK.  Repellant.  And there are now several receptors known that are able to be, 
there are several guidance cues known that can either be attractants or 
repellants.  What happens when a growth cone sees a repulsive signal?  This 
movie will show you.  That is the growth cone collapsing.  Let me show it to you 
again. 

So you start off with a pretty robust growth cone, and it collapses when you put a 
little drop of some guidance cue that it doesn't like up in this corner of the slide. 
And what happens is that that actin cytoskeleton that is there just collapses, 
depolymerizes, and that axon tries to get as far away from the repulsive cue as it 
can. 

So we've talked about short-range and long-range guidance cues.  We've talked 
about attractive and repulsive guidance cues.  We've talked about how one 
single guidance cue can be both an attractant and a repellant.  And now I want to 
get back to this very old hypothesis that the way that you actually got synaptic 
connections and the way you've got circuitry set up was by some kind of random 
way that involved survival of neurons that made the appropriate connections. 

In fact, that is true once you get neurons to where they're finally going.  So you're 
setting up neurons, they're going along their path set up by some guidance cues. 
And of course you should be asking the question, well, how do the guidance 
cues get there in the first place, right?  OK?  So that's a question you can go and 
sit and think about.  But in the end what happens is that you stabilize 
connections. 

And you do it in two ways. 

Both of which, or one of which seems to be activity dependent, or another of 
which is activity independent.  By activity dependent, I mean that the nerve has 
to fire. 

There has to be synaptic activity.  And that will maintain the connection.  If there 
is not synaptic activity you will not.  And there are some cases where that is not 
the case.  This is number six on your handout.  When neurons grow out to the 
neuromuscular junction they form a synapse, or when the neurons grow out to 
the muscle they form a synapse with the muscle.  The synapse is initially a rather 
weak one, and over time there are proteins that are activated. 

Acetylcholine receptors, for example, that are activated that set up the synapse 
and stabilize it and maintain it.  So that is one example of stabilizing connections. 
Another very famous example is growth factors that are survival signals.  One of 
the most famous is NGF which stands for nerve growth factor. 

And this is a protein that is involved in making certain sets of neurons survive 
when they get to their targets.  There seems to be a limiting amount of nerve 
growth factor around in specific regions of the animal, and only those neurons 
that can capture enough of that nerve growth factor on their receptors will 
survive.  So there are neuronal survival signals that may or may not require a 
neuronal activity for their effect.  OK. 

So two final things.  One is this retinotectal map.  We talked about the outcome 
of the Sperry experiments and how you got the neurons going back to where 
they are.  What's the molecular basis for that?  Well, you can show very 
beautifully that the neurons prefer to grow on a particular part of membrane that 
you give them.  So, for example, the retinal neurons will choose to grow on the 
anterior rostral and not on the more posterior caudal neurons. 

And you can show that the reason for that is due to a class of molecules called 
the ephrins.  Ephrins are secreted molecules, but they are short range.  They 
work just on the cell next door.  And you can show, I'm flashing this up, I know 
you can go and look at it later on, that wherever there is ephrin you do not see 
axonal outgrowth. 

So ephrins are inhibitory to axonal outgrowth.  And I'm going to refer you to, I'm 
not going to go through it.  I'm going to refer you to number eight on your 
handout.  I'm not going to go through this.  You can look at it.  But I will just tell 
you that there are different combinations of ephrins and Eph receptors which 
guide retinal axons to the correct part of the tectum. 

The last thing that I want to spend the last minute on is a particularly fascinating 
point.  And that is the question of nerve regeneration, and nerve regeneration in 
the central nervous system.  So we believe right now that the same, in fact, we 
know that the cues that tell axons where to go in the first place in an embryo are 
maintained in the adult nervous system.  And we also know that if you cut one of 
the nerves in your peripheral nervous system in your arm it will grow back fine. 

But we also know if you sever your spinal cord it will not grow back.  And there 
has been intense research to try to figure out what it is that is making the axons 
in your spinal cord not grow back to where they were, although, in fact they 
should.  Here's a diagram of an intact CNS axon.  If it's severed of course you're 
going to get a fragment that's not connected to a cell body, but the other part of it 
is still connected to the cell body. 

And what happens is that that dies, that cell dies.  It undergoes apoptosis and 
dies.  And it's really not clear why it doesn't regenerate.  One hypothesis is that 
there it is a poor growth environment in the extracellular matrix around the axon 
in the CNS.  Another class of proteins of great interest are the Nogos and related 
ligands which are believed to be inhibitory to axon regrowth.  And there's a lot of 
interest in this kind of thing. 

And I'll stop there.  Thanks.
