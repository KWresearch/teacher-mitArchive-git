7.013 Introductory Biology, Spring 2006 
Transcript – Lecture 11 

OK.  And here we are in the molecular biology section.  And the goal of 
this section, as Professor Jacks started to tell you during the Genetics 
module and Professor Baker told you at the beginning of last lecture is 
try to link together in molecular terms the question of genotype and 
the question of phenotype. 

And we presented to you this notion that goes by the ponderous name 
of the central dogma that the link between genotype and phenotype is 
related to DNA as a genetic material that then proceeds to transmit its 
information to a final outcome, which is very often a protein, through 
an RNA intermediate. 

And the point of these molecular biology lectures is to tell you about 
the molecular biology, and then at the end to try to bring together this 
genotype and phenotype in molecular terms. 

Now, last lecture you talked about DNA replication, DNA as the genetic 
material required to be replicated faithfully and accurately so it can 
transmit its information to the next generation.  Professor Baker I 
know stressed the requirement for accurate replication, but she did not 
do one part of this lecture that I want to spend a couple of minutes 
now discussing with you.  And that is the question of DNA repair. 

So there are two types of DNA repair.  Actually, three types that I 
want to talk to you about.  And the first pertains to the accuracy of the 
DNA polymerase that replicates the DNA.  So DNA polymerase --

-- three, or the DNA polymerase that replicates the DNA makes 
mistakes.  It puts in the wrong nucleotide.  It puts in the wrong base. 
And it does so about one in ten to the fifth bases.  OK?  So one in a 
hundred thousand bases is wrong. 

Now, if you think about the fact that there are more than ten to the 
ninth bases in a human genome, every cell cycle that translates to ten 
thousand or so mistakes, that’s a lot of changes in the DNA.  That’s 
not a very faithful kind of DNA replication.  So this has been selected 

against evolutionarily.  And there is a mechanism that’s called 
proofreading --

That allows this high error rate to be corrected.  And it’s actually very 
cleaver.  So this DNA polymerase has what is called an exonuclease 
activity.  Exo meaning out.  Nuclease meaning to break down nucleic 
acids.  And this exonuclease proceeds from the 3 prime to the 5 prime 
direction, the 3 prime nucleotide being the one that was added last as 
you should now know. 

And so what DNA polymerase does as it is replicating is it kind of feels 
whether or not the double helix has reformed in a smooth way.  And if 
it feels that there is a bubble there, a bubble where the two bases, 
actually look at me rather than the diagram.  I think it’s easier.  I can 
do it better with my hands.  Where you’ve got a nice smooth helix, if 
there is a mismatched nucleotide, the bases do not pair, there will be a 
bubble. 

OK?  There will be a bubble in the helix or a space in the helix.  The 
two strands will not be joined together.  And the DNA polymerase can 
sense this and it can go back and it excises the wrong nucleotide and 
puts in the correct one.  OK?  This is called proofreading.  And it’s 
extremely necessary and it’s actually very good.  And what it does is 
to decrease the error rate to one in ten to the ninth bases. 

OK?  So you get four orders of magnitude improvement in the 
accuracy of DNA replication.  Now, there is another set of things that 
can go wrong.  And these actually fall under the heading of mutagens. 
Mutagens, as Professor Jacks mentioned to you, being agents which 
change the base sequence of the DNA once the DNA is there. 

And these can either be chemical or these can be ionizing radiation. 
And in those cases also the helix gets changed because the wrong 
base gets put in.  No, not because the wrong base gets put in.  But 
because there is a chemical reaction which might modify a base, which 
might, for example, covalently link two bases.  thymine for example. 
If two thymines are sitting next to one another in the helix, ultraviolet 
light is very good at cross linking those. 

And you now have something called a thymine dimer.  And that is very 
bad because that is not a normal base sequence.  And when replication 
time comes along that DNA helix is abnormal and the replication 
machinery doesn’t know what to do about it, and that can lead to all 

sorts of problems and to mutations.  So there are mechanisms that 
can get rid of abnormal bases. 

So mutagens can chemically, actually, maybe not say chemically.  Let 
me just say change bases.  They change base structure either to 
something that looks like another normal new base or to something 
that looks abnormal.  And there are two mechanisms to get rid of this. 
One is called excision repair and the other is called mismatch repair. 

I have them written in the reverse order than is on this diagram from 
your book.  In mismatch repair there is one nucleotide that looks 
normal, but it’s different.  It doesn’t match the, usually it looks 
normal.  It doesn’t match the one opposite to it.  And in that case the 
repair machinery can go in and remove the abnormal or the 
mismatched nucleotide, and there’s another enzyme that will go and 
correct it. 

In excision repair, one very often, excision repair occurs when, for 
example, two nucleotides have become covalently linked to one 
another, and the one strand of the helix is just a mess.  And there is 
an enzyme, or enzyme complex that will go in and actually excise a 
little chunk of the helix.  And then another enzyme will come in and fill 
in the gap so that you get the helix repaired. 

Now, the challenge in this, and you may be asking yourselves this, is 
how does this repair machinery know which the correct strand was? 
In the case of proofreading it’s very interesting because initially after 
replication the newly synthesized DNA strand is not modified.  It’s just 
a normal nucleotide polymer.  However, the template strand, the 
template strands, the parental strands over time become chemically 
modified. 

The bases actually get, especially adenine gets some methyl groups 
added to it.  And this  is different than the newly synthesized with 
doesn’t have these methyl groups.  And so the polymerase knows 
which strand is the old strand and the correct one and which is the 
new strand and the incorrect one.  In the case of excision and 
mismatch repair, that’s sometimes not clear.  Where you’ve got these 
thymine dimmers, these Ts that are joined together then that’s clearly 
the wrong, that’s clearly wrong. 

OK?  The enzymatic machinery can take that out and copy the other 
strand.  Sometimes, though, if you just have a chemical conversion of 
one base to another, the repair machinery does not know which strand 

is the correct and which isn’t.  And that’s when you’ll get mutations 
fixed in the DNA because at replication you really may get the 
changing, you may get the incorrect, you may not get the correct base 
repairs. 

And then that incorrect base will be passed on through the next 
generation.  OK.  So this is a very rapid zip through DNA repair that I 
wanted you to be able to think about.  I want to move onto the next 
step in the transmission of information from gene to final product 
today. 

And I want to talk to you about the generation of RNA.  And so let us 
begin with a quiz.  And I have for you a new incentive to pay 
attention, a new prize that you can use to think about the conversion 
of potential to kinetic energy, and also you can use to amuse yourself 
when you’re downloading very poor, when you’re downloading things 
from the Internet and have nothing better to do. 

I can usually get this right across the room.  There you go.  You can 
also use it to think about the nature of amphibians, they're nice flying 
frogs.  OK.  So let us pose the question here, what is RNA? 

And you’ve had some of this on a problem set, but you really need to 
know what I’m talking about.  This is a ribonucleotide.  How do I know 
that this is a ribonucleotide?  Think about it.  You can put your hands 
up, but I want everyone to think about it.  OK.  And you need to 
identify the precise chemical group, please, that tells me.  I saw you 
two first, so yes. 

What does the lower right mean?  Give me a name.  It’s the?  There’s 
a number there.  The?  Ah, we have a discrepancy of opinion here. 
Someone says it’s a 3 prime hydroxyl on the ribose and someone says 
it’s the 2 prime hydroxyl on the ribose. 

Let’s take a vote.  Who thinks that this is identified as a ribose 
because of this 2 prime hydroxyl?  Thank you.  And who believes it’s 
the 3 prime hydroxyl that identified riboses?  OK.  We have a smaller 
but firm contingent.  In fact, it’s the 2 prime hydroxyl that identifies 
this is ribose.  You remember, and you really need to remember that 
this three prime hydroxyl is the reactive group that allows the sugar 
phosphate backbone to polymerize. 

This 2 prime hydroxyl is a reactive group.  It identifies this as ribose 
rather than deoxyribose, and it also is an additional reactive group. 

And the fact that it is a reactive group makes RNA rather labile.  OK? 
So let’s write a couple of important things here.  So this is RNA as the 
nucleic acid polymer. 

You should really know this.  Ribose has both a 3 prime hydroxyl and 
this 2 prime hydroxyl.  And this is a reactive group.  And because of 
this RNA is a much less stable polymer than DNA.  Here’s another one. 
What type of polynucleotide is this and how do you know?  Yes. 

You.  OK.  It’s RNA.  And it’s RNA we know because of these uracil 
groups.  OK?  So uracil is an alternate base to thymine that’s found 
only in RNA.  Here are the Us.  It tells you it’s RNA.  OK?  So you need 
to know those facts about RNA. 

Good.  So let me pose a question to you.  In this litany that you’ve had 
several times now where the flow of information moves from DNA to 
RNA to protein, why is the RNA there?  This is a rhetorical question. 
I’m going to try to answer it for you. 

Why is the RNA there?  Why is there an RNA intermediate? 

You could imagine that the DNA double helix could open up and that 
nucleic acid could be directly translated or could be directly converted 
or the code could be changed to form a protein without any RNA 
intermediate. 

But, in fact, universally throughout biology, throughout our world 
anyway, throughout our earth, RNA is there as an intermediate.  Why? 
Well, I think the answer actually lies in evolution.  RNA is probably the 
most ancient of the information polymers.  That is widely believed 
now.  So RNA is ancient.  It was the first, strongly believed now that it 
was the first information carrying polymer. 

RNAs themselves were catalytic.  They became able to replicate.  And 
they also probably became able to be translated into protein before 
DNA was invented.  OK?  So DNA’s chemical structure is different and 
it’s a derivative of ribonucleic acid, and undoubtedly came second. 
There was an advantage of having DNA because it’s so much more 
stable, and it made the hereditary material much more stable and 
much more faithfully transmitted from generation to generation. 

So RNA was ancient.  And the relationship between RNA and protein is 
probably a very old one, and we’ll talk about this relationship next 
lecture.  And I believe that that relationship has persisted, and then 

DNA was kind of an add-on.  And the DNA to RNA to protein does not 
necessarily reflect the only way or the best way to do things. 

Evolution is a capitalization of various changes.  And RNA to DNA, DNA 
to RNA to protein is how things work now.  But this, I think, is a 
consequence of the evolutionary past.  Now, however, in our modern 
world RNA serves two main purposes. 

One of the things it does is to allow one to use just a subset of the 
genes to make proteins.  So, as you’ve been told several times, you 
and I have about 30,000 genes in our genomes.  Not all of those 
genes, and we will discuss this in great depth as the course goes on. 
Not all of those genes are used at any one time.  We use just a subset 
of the genes. 

And having them converted into an RNA intermediate is one of the 
ways that you can allow just a subset of the genes to be used.  So I’m 
going to write here subset. 

Subset of gene usage.  OK?  Because you can turn just some of those 
genes, or you can convert some of those genes into RNA, the 
information in some of those genes into RNA. 

And the other thing it lets you do is to amplify the signal from each 
gene.  So there are two copies of each gene in a diploid cell.  When it 
comes to RNA there can be up to 10,000 copies of RNA per cell of a 
particular RNA.  OK?  So you can get an amplification of the signal --

-- from each gene.  RNA copy number per cell ranges from about one 
copy to about 10,000, that’s rare, copies per cell.  All right.  So here 
we are.  Why RNA? We’ve dealt with that. 

So I want to talk to you about two things.  I want to talk to you about 
synthesizing the RNA, and then I’m going to talk to you about 
modifying the RNA a bit.  And the first thing I want to cover is 
something called transcription. 

Which is also known as RNA synthesis.  And you all should have this 
handout.  So I’m not going to draw it but I will write some salient 
features on the board for you. 

And we’re not quite ready to use that.  I’m going to leave this up here, 
but I’m going to work on the board for a little bit.  The basic idea 

behind transcription, RNA synthesis, is that one copies a DNA template 
into a complementary RNA strand, complementary RNA. 

And one does this, as I’ve alluded to, only from the genes. 

And this is an interesting point because although you have 30,000 
genes in your genome, in fact, those 30,000 genes only take up about 
5% of the total amount of DNA in each of your cells.  So 5% of your 
total DNA of your genome comprises the genes, the information 
carrying entities in your DNA.  And the rest is other stuff. 

So the 95% is not genes.  It consists of various repeats, repetitive 
DNA that can be there at just a few copies per genome or at 10,000 
copies per genome.  They can be real little, 10 base pairs, six base 
pair repeats, or they can be a few kilo bases repeated many times. 
Oris, Origins of Replication that you talked about last time are not 
genes. 

Those are there, too.  Centromeres, the middles of chromosomes. 
Telomeres, the ends of chromosomes.  All of these things are not 
genes, and they comprise the bulk of your DNA.  Now, this isn’t true in 
all organisms.  OK?  Some organisms have got very little of this 
repetitive extra DNA. 

We happen to have a great deal of it.  OK.  So let’s pursue this a bit 
more.  And let’s think a bit more about these genes.  And in particular 
let’s think about the kinds of RNAs that those genes make.  So I’m 
going to talk about gene classes or classes. 

And this is with respect to the RNA and the functional RNA that comes 
from those sets of genes.  And I want to distinguish two major classes 
of genes. The first are the protein encoding genes.  And protein 
encoding genes move through a type of RNA that is called messenger 
RNA, abbreviated mRNA. 

Messenger RNAs comprise about 1% of the total amount of RNA in a 
cell.  And they can range in size from let’s say 100 base pairs to 
10,000 base pairs.  OK? 

So there’s a very wide size range.  No, not base pairs.  Yell at me. 
Why not base pairs?  Why was I wrong saying base pairs?  Tell me 
about RNA.  Raise your hand.  This is worth a frog.  I caught myself, 
but if you can catch me, too.  Yes.  You.  Good.  OK.  Generally RNA is 
single, woops. 

RNA is single-stranded.  It does not form, it can form a double helix, 
OK?  It’s not as stable as the DNA double helix, and many RNAs, 
probably most RNAs have some double-strandedness to them, but that 
is an intromolecular double strand in this.  There are some RNAs that 
form intermolecular double strands, but in generally I’m going to 
assume that RNAs are single-stranded.  So we talk about 100 bases 
rather than 100 base pairs. 

OK?  Second class of genes are the ones that do not code for protein, 
and in this case the RNA is the final product.  And this litany of DNA to 
RNA to protein doesn’t hold.  You just stop at the RNA.  And the RNA is 
the functional thing.  So here RNA is the final product. 

And we can break these into a bunch of different classes.  Ribosomal 
RNAs, abbreviated rRNA are a very abundant class of RNA that 
comprise about, I’ve moved over here, let me move here, 98% of total 
RNA.  And there are a few thousand bases in length that say 2,000 to 
4,000 bases in length. 

OK?  So this is 98% ribosomal RNA.  This is fascinating.  I’ll tell you 
next time.  This is the RNA that comprises a very large proportion of 
the ribosome that is the factory that makes the proteins.  OK?  And so 
I will tell you more about these next time.  Some other ones, tRNA, 
the T for transfer RNA. 

tRNA comprise about 1% of all RNA and are about 100 base pairs, 100 
bases long.  OK? And then an interesting one that MIT has had a huge 
role in discovering and studying, these things called micro RNAs, 
abbreviated miRNAs, which are, they’re at relatively low abundance. 

Less than 1% of total RNAs.  And these are small.  In their mature 
form they’re about 22 bases in length.  OK.  So now, and I believe I 
cannot do anything with these boards. 

Ah, I can do something with this one, but that one is stuck.  All right. 
So I’m going to do something with this one.  And then I’m afraid it’s 
going to disappear, but it’s not going to matter because you have the 
handout in front of you.  So now I’m ready to move on with you to the 
basic idea of transcription.  And I’m going to write some facts on the 
board, and we’re going to look at these cartoons that I drew for you 
together because I think your book is kind of difficult. 

So I decided to draw some cartoons to help you with the basic idea. 
Transcription or RNA synthesis takes place in the nucleus. 

Anyone else need a handout?  Why don’t you come on down.  Actually, 
one of the TAs, could you be an emissary and just hand out to those 
people with raised hands?  Thanks.  Transcription takes place in the 
nucleus.  And the idea is really analogous to DNA replication with a 
difference.  The analogy is the synthesis of a complementary strand of 
nucleic acid on a template strand. 

So this is an enormously important principle that you need to have. 
Super important that you get the principle.  The basic idea involves 
synthesis of a complementary strand of nucleic acid from a template 
strand.  The template, actually, let me start even earlier than that. 

We start with a gene that generally comprises double-stranded DNA. 
There are exceptions to almost everything that I will tell you, or that 
Professor Jacks will tell you.  You should understand that there are 
exceptions.  Some organisms, particularly viruses have genomes that 
are RNA that can be single-stranded or double-stranded RNA. 

Some have genomes that are single-stranded DNA.  But in general 
most genomes are double-stranded DNA.  And the deal is this.  The 
double-stranded DNA separates its strands, and one of the strands, 
and this is the difference between DNA replication and transcription, 
one of the strands becomes the template strand. 

And this template is copied to form a complementary strand.  And it’s 
copied by an enzyme called RNA polymerase.  So RNA polymerase 
synthesizes the complementary strand to the template strand. 

complementary strand.  And it does so, of course, as RNA, because 
we’re talking about RNA synthesis and this is RNA polymerase.  It does 
not, unlike DNA polymerization, require a primer.  So this does not 
require a primer. 

OK.  You should know, and it should be getting deep within your 
neural circuitry that polymerization occurs by adding nucleotides to the 
3 prime end of the growing polymer.  Yes.  If that didn’t make, you 
know, if you didn’t say "yeah" to that, go back and think about it, go 
back and look at problem sets and you’ll get more practice in this.  But 
you really need to know that the growing chain adds onto the 3 prime 
end. 

OK.  So after the polymer, after the RNA polymer is made the RNA is 
released from the template strand.  As its being transcribed it forms 
this complementary strand.  And, as you know, complementary 
strands can base pair.  After it’s made it is released from the template. 

And it usually then goes into the cytoplasm where it does its thing.  So 
if you look at the diagram I gave you, that’s what’s up here, here’s 
your double-stranded DNA, your gene.  The strands separate.  One 
strand is transcribed into RNA.  The RNA is release.  Obviously, your 
double-stranded template, or what was your double-stranded template 
will reform its double strand. 

So perhaps that’s not so obvious, but the double-stranded, originally 
double-stranded template will reform its double strands, thus released 
RNA, then goes into the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein, 
or where the RNA is the final product.  So let’s look at that in a bit 
more detail. 

I’ve got here a template strand shown in red.  This is, again, the 
second picture in the handout in front of you.  And I’ve got three 
features added here.  I have got a precise start site of transcription. 
I’ve indicated elongation where the polymer is elongating.  And I have 
a precise termination site where transcription ends.  OK?  Now, let me 
see what I have here. 

I have a movie here.  Watch the movie.  I’ll show it to you once, and 
then you can go and watch it at your leisure.  This is meant to be RNA 
polymerase.  There’s the helix opening up locally.  Here are 
ribonucleotide triphosphates coming in, and RNA polymerase is 
catalyzing their synthesis.  OK? 

So the template strand is the bottom and here is the RNA being 
released.  There’s RNA polymerase moving along the helix.  And the 
depiction is that the helix is opening locally and then closing again 
behind the RNA polymerase.  At transcription termination, the helix, 
the gene helix zips up again and the transcript is released.  So this is a 
very much simplified story. 

But is the basic principle of transcription.  And you should know it. 
And in particular I have put onto this second diagram, and because 
you have him in front of you I’m not going to write this on the board, 
I’m going to use this as something to tell you, I have put the 
directionality of the strands of the double-helix on this diagram.  This 

should be something you can deal with.  5 prime to 3 prime on one 
strand. 

The other strand is anti-parallel.  RNA, any nucleic acid is synthesized 
by adding onto the 3 prime end.  And that newly synthesizing nucleic 
acid polymer is anti-parallel to the template.  This is also something 
that you should be familiar with.  And you will have, will have, have 
not yet, will have practice on doing this kind of polymerization, but it 
should be something you really, really should be familiar with, this 
anti-parallel requirement. 

So, in fact, you can tell the direction of transcription because of the 
directionality of the template strand.  OK.  So this is very important for 
you to go and think about after class the directionality of the template 
and of the newly synthesized polymer.  These are some diagrams from 
your book, and you can go and look at them.  I’m not going to dwell 
on them.  They indicate the different between, or the steps in 
transcription initiation, elongation and termination. 

And I’ve put them up there just to tell you there are these diagrams in 
your book and you can go and take a look at them and read the 
accompanying text.  OK.  So I see three problems with transcription 
that are very interesting problems. 

One is how to find the genes.  I’ll write them on the board and then 
we’ll go through them. 

5% of the genome is genes.  That’s most of it that is not genes.  How 
does the transcription enzyme, how does the RNA polymerase know 
which is a gene and which is not a gene?  How does it know, even if it 
finds the gene, which strand is the template strand and which is not 
the template strand? 

I could have drawn your previous diagram where the top strand was 
the template, and that what would have happened would be that the 
RNA synthesis went in the other direction.  So which strand is the 
template? 

And that also gives you the direction, of course, of transcription.  And 
the third one I’m going to write, and then I’ll tell you about this in a 
moment.  I’m going to write how to unwrap chromatin.  OK. 

So in each of your cells, you have to look at me for this.  In each of 
your cells there is this length of DNA.  One meter.  This is a little over, 

but one meter of DNA.  How big is the average cell in diameter?  Give 
it to me in micrometers.  Worth a frog.  On average.  Well, that’s 
actually a really big cell.  It’s about ten times less than that. 

But whoever that was, who was it?  No way.  These are very bad to 
throw.  Very bad to throw.  You can have it because you caught it. 
See me afterwards.  I’ll give you one.  OK.  [LAUGHTER]  OK.  So how 
do you pack a meter of DNA into a cell that is about ten microns in 
diameter?  OK.  So, OK, Jamie, you want to hazard an answer here? 
Your hand was up. 

OK.  Good.  You can wind it up.  OK.  The other thing you have to do, 
of course, is to make it really thin.  It has to be a lot thinner than my 
piece of rope.  But once you’ve made it really thin you can then wind it 
up.  OK.  It’s logical and this is how it’s done.  And you can wind it up 
and then it will fit into your ten micron cell. 

Now, in actual fact, there’s a whole process to do that.  And I’m going 
to go through them as we go through these problems here.  So here is 
problem one exemplified.  I’ve got red little dots for each of the genes. 
How does RNA polymerase find these genes in this vast amount of 
DNA that is not genes?  Here’s the other one.  Which strand is the 
template?  Oh. 

And here is a nice problem that in the interest of time I am not going 
to do here in class with you, but I want you guys to go and do this as 
an exercise.  I will tell you that the answer is not on your handout on 
the Web.  I took it off.  Sneaky, ha?  So that you can go and think 
about this.  I want you to go and understand that the products of 
synthesis from either strand of a DNA double-stranded helix are not 
the same. 

OK?  And I’m going to zip through this because I want to move on 
here.  OK.  And I want to move to problem three which is this thing I 
called chromatin.  DNA is wound up around proteins.  These are called 
histones, and we’ll have more to say about them later in the course. 
And wound up and wound up and wound up.  And there is a very set 
number and type of proteins that the DNA is wound around. 

And once the DNA has been wound around once, those DNA protein 
complexes are wound up some more, and then wound up some more. 
And eventually you get them wound up and wrapped up so much you 
get the characteristic rather large chromosomes which are very much 
packed DNA.  Now, this is a great way to fit DNA into a cell.  However, 

this wrapping up of the chromatin into, the wrapping up of the DNA 
into this chromatin structure inhibits transcription. 

And in order to allow transcription to proceed, you have to remove 
these proteins from the DNA and allow it to unwind locally.  And that 
takes a whole series of enzymatic steps, again that we’ll explore more 
later in the course.  But the problem I throw out at you now is hw do 
you unwrap the chromatin where transcription is needed?  And the 
answer to all of these things lies in a specific, no, stop. 

Stop. Down.  Up.  OK.  The answer to all of these questions lies in a 
specific DNA sequence or a series of specific DNA sequences that are 
collectively called --

-- the promoter.  Here’s another one.  What is a promoter?  And I 
need to make the distinction now between transcribed DNA of a gene 
and untranscribed DNA of a gene.  The promoter is part of a gene but 
it is not transcribed. 

It usually depends on the gene and the type of gene.  It usually lies 5 
prime to the transcriptional start site.  And it is a DNA sequence that 
says this is a gene, and it also says transcription should proceed in this 
direction.  OK. 

And the way it does these things, I’m going to each of the answers to 
each of the problems now, is that it binds proteins that specifically 
recognize the sequence of the promoter.  So you talked about the DNA 
replication origin and proteins that specifically recognize the nucleotide 
sequence of the origin.  This is analogous.  There are proteins that 
recognize promoter sequences which are similar but not identical from 
gene to gene. 

So it binds proteins.  And these are called transcription factors. 

And these transcription factors bind in a DNA sequence specific way. 
OK.  It also binds RNA polymerase which I’m going to abbreviate RNA 
polymerase, RNA pol. 

OK?  And the answers to the three questions are that firstly the 
protein-DNA interaction is sequence specific, sequence specific, and so 
this allows you to actually find the genes. 

Secondly, and this is cool and I’ll show you a picture of this in a 
moment, the proteins interact with a promoter DNA differently on 

different strands of the helix so they bind asymmetrically.  They may 
bind more to one strand than to the other strand.  And this gives 
directionality to the transcription so the protein binding is asymmetric 
or strand specific. 

Not for all of these proteins but for a significant number.  And that 
helps you decide which strand you’re going to use as the template. 
And thirdly these proteins have got associated with them activities that 
will unwrap the chromatin, that will unwrap the DNA from its protein 
complexes and allow it to be accessible to the transcription machinery. 

OK.  Let’s zip so I can show you this.  You can look at this on your 
slides.  Here are some pictures from your book.  Really important in 
this, don’t move.  Really important in this is a protein called TF2D 
which recognizes a sequence called, that goes T-A-T-A-A-A. 

This is called the TATA binding protein.  And it’s really important.  And 
it’s the one thing that, the major thing that gives asymmetry to this 
transcription, set of transcription factors on the promoter.  Once TF2D 
has bound to the promoter, other proteins come along, including these 
various other things called BFHG and so on. 

And here’s RNA polymerase.  And you can see this complex positioned 
asymmetrically on the DNA.  And this complex you should know the 
name of, I’m going to put it in its own box here, is the initiation 
complex. 

And I want to show you a crystallographic rendition of the TATA 
binding protein called TBP, also sometimes called TF2D.  But TATA 
binding protein here shown in purple.  And if you look here, you’re 
looking head on at the double helix.  OK?  Here’s the helix.  You’re 
looking down the helix.  And you can see that this protein is positioned 
on just one side of the helix, so that gives you asymmetry. 

Here’s another transcription factor bound to DNA.  This is a protein 
called GAL-4.  It binds as a dimer.  And you can see that GAL4 is the 
blue.  And here it is contacting just one side, one strand of this red 
double helix.  And I’m going to stop there and finish off the last little 
bit on Monday.
