<p></p> <p>The following content is provided by MIT Open Courseware under a  creative commons license. Additional information about our license and  MIT Open Courseware in general, is available at ocw.mit.edu.</p> <p>The end of last lecture I got an interesting question about apoptosis  which I covered very briefly towards the end of that lecture.</p> <p>And the question was this. Do healthy cells tell sick cells to die?  Or in turn, do sick cells tell healthy cells to die? So, is there some  kind of communication between cells as to who is healthy and who is not  healthy? For those of you who are just coming in, there is a handout  outside, and up front, it's the same thing.</p> <p>And that's actually a very interesting question because they really  does seem in the body to be some sense of monitoring whether cells are  healthy or not. Now, a lot of the time, cells that are not healthy  intrinsically activate their own death program, or they have the  ability, they gain the ability to respond to some kind of extrinsic  signals.</p> <p>And, in fact, signals could be sent both ways, we believe, where sick  cells will tell healthy cells to die after conditions that are  obviously not favorable to the organism, but more important, that  healthy cells can tell sick cells not to survive.</p> <p>So, the balance of apoptosis and cell survival is a very delicate one  and regulated by many, many things. So, it's a good question. All  right, we move on. We move on to a new module. So, you has in fact  covered the foundations of modern biology.</p> <p>You've covered them in a very superficial way. And I want to  emphasize that. You should, by now, know how to take a piece of DNA,  conceptually turn it into RNA, and conceptually turn that into a  protein.</p> <p>You should know what to do if the DNA sequence is changed. You should  have the expectation that the RNA and protein that are made from it  will be changed, too, and you should have various other nuggets of  information that are covered by foundations.</p> <p>These foundations are not going to go away. We're going to use them  throughout the rest of these uncovered black boxes. And, I'm going to  assume that you remember a bunch of stuff as I go through the material  in the next several lectures.</p> <p>But, we are going to move in to the formation module. And, today, we  are going to talk about things in a kind of overview way. And, I'm going  to tell you five major things that are important. And, I'm going to  write them on the board, and some of the things they need to know about  them.</p> <p>And, we will use the slides as well. So, what is formation? What is  this module all about? Well, it's about something called development  where development is the process by which one cell, the fertilized egg  or the zygote goes on to make a multi-cellular and complex organism.</p> <p>This is not about squishy little embryos. OK, this is about life as  it began, as it continues in your own bodies. And, it has immense  applications for multiple biomedical and bioengineering processes that  I'll talk about as we go through.</p> <p>The first thing you need to know is what's written up here is that  the development occurs over time and space. And, that's one of the  things that makes it an incredibly complex set of processes to think  about.</p> <p>The overtime can be a long time. And, what's important to understand  is that developmental processes occur throughout life. Initially, in the  formation of the organism from a single cell, the fertilized egg, the  zygote, and later on, early in the formation of the embryo, and later,  in the renewal of the adult.</p> <p>And this is where the stem cells come in. And, we'll have a lecture  on stem cells later on. But, development is something that occurs  throughout life. And, in fact, I teach an upper-class course on  development to graduate students.</p> <p>And, the first thing I tell them when I start to teach them is really  there is no such subject as developmental biology because it covers, it  includes, it encompasses biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology,  protein structure, and many different disciplines.</p> <p>And, it occurs throughout life. So, it really covers everything. But  we have put these things together in the formation module, and I think  you will find them interesting. OK, so here's a schematic of how things  work courtesy of Picasso.</p> <p>And really, this whole process is quite remarkable. It starts with  two dying cells. The egg and the sperm, haploid cells that have a  half-life that have a life of about 12 hours up to which they are dead.</p> <p>But, when they fuse, there's magic that happens, and you get a viable  cell, the zygote, that has the capacity to go on and divide many, many  times to form an embryo and ultimately an adult organism.</p> <p>And, as we've mentioned many times, it is estimated that there are  about ten to the 14th cells in the human. In the adults, and even in  young adults, there is much replacement of cells throughout life.</p> <p>And this whole process obviously takes place over time. But that's  important because the time component means that things change over time.  And, in order to understand this entire slide, you have to factor in  this fourth dimension.</p> <p>So, what are some of the things that we're going to cover in this  module, and why are we bothering to talk to you about the subject? Well,  one of the things that's of interest is the effect of chemicals on the  formation of a normal body.</p> <p>So, there are these things called teratogens, which are chemicals  that affect formation of early steps in development of the embryo. This  is a famous one, the effects of a famous one called thalidomide that was  given as an anti-nausea medication during pregnancy some decades ago.</p> <p>It has no effect on rodents on which it was tested, but it was not  tested on primates before you give it to people, and it has the  devastating effect of preventing limb formation, and a number of people  were born in the late 1940s, early 1950s, who lacked limbs because of  the effect of thalidomide.</p> <p>And, I have to tell you, this is very interesting for those of you  who are interested in chemistry. Thalidomide has a pretty simple  chemical structure. It has been studied for many, many decades. It's a  very interesting drug because it turns out it prevents cachexia, which  is the wasting that occurs with many disorders including HIV-AIDS  infection.</p> <p>So, thalidomide is a very, very useful drug. It has a simple chemical  structure. It's been studied for decades, and we do not know its  mechanism of action. OK, here's another one that you might be familiar  with, the drug, not the syndrome, I hope.</p> <p>So, fetal alcohol syndrome, so, a normal brain, this is a brain taken  from a fetus. That is the late stage gestation human whose mother drink  excessive amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. So, during the early  stages of pregnancy the first few months, alcohol is devastating to  formation of the brain and also to the bones of the face.</p> <p>And, even a reasonable number of drinks, apparently, just a few can  significantly lower the IQ points of a baby. And so, it's a good reason  not to drink if you're pregnant. This was a very devastating case.</p> <p>You can see the brain is very smooth. It doesn't have those nice  valleys and hills, the sulci and the gyri that the normal brain has, and  this fetus would not have been able to survive. Here's one.</p> <p>This is the dream of all biologists, developmental or otherwise. It's  a dream of bioengineers. It's probably the dream of everybody. Someone  cuts off their arm in an accident: can we grow a new one? Well, newts  can.</p> <p>So, in this example, newts can. So, in this example, the newt limb,  this poor animal was amputated just above the elbow. But over a period  of a few months, another limb grew back, smaller than the original but  perfectly functional.</p> <p>We can't do that. How do newts do it, and how could we use that  information to help people grow new limbs, or new hearts, or new eyes?  Fish, for example, the fisheye work on zebrafish can grow a new heart.</p> <p>You can cut the heart into two. Take away half of it. It'll  regenerate a new heart. There are animals were you can remove half of  the retina or all of the retina, and it will regenerate a new retina.</p> <p>We do some regeneration. You can take away two thirds of the liver,  and new liver will grow back. And, that's one of the principles behind  liver transplants. But, we can't do things like regenerate eyes, and  hearts, and limbs.</p> <p>It's been the focus of study for a long time to try to figure out how  newts do it, and to ask whether we can capitalize on that knowledge.  And, I have to tell you, it's been a very tough area of biology, still  wide open.</p> <p>And, that's where the great god of stem cells comes in. Because it's  been so difficult to get limb regeneration, for example, and heart  regeneration, there is a sense that perhaps we could get groups of cells  to repair damaged organs.</p> <p>And, stem cells are the things that hold this promise. And, we'll  have a whole lecture on this later. And, part and parcel of stem cells  is the very newsworthy issue of human cloning, making identical replicas  of things.</p> <p>And, we'll talk about this also in a separate lecture. OK, all right,  so let's move on to the next set of things that you need to know. And,  that's the notion that there are multiple processes that are involved in  setting up development formation of any multi-cellular organism.</p> <p>So, multiple processes are involved. And, these are cell division,  right, a single cell, so, ten to the 14th cells. You figure out how many  rounds of cell division at us. Actually, that's a tough question.</p> <p>You could go and do that, OK, and over spring break if you're lying  on the beach or hanging out on a mountain, if you can find any snow you  can go and figure out how many cell divisions it takes to get ten to the  14th cells.</p> <p>But, it's not so easy because cells don't just divide from one to ten  to the 14th. As they are dividing, there's a balance of cell division,  and as we talked about last lecture, of cell death. OK, so cell division  versus cell death, and so I can't tell you how many divisions that  takes because there are a lot of cells that die along the way to those  ten to the 14th cells.</p> <p>Here's another one: cell type. What's cell type? Different kinds of  cells in the body, we mentioned this right at the beginning of the  course. Skin cells, cells that produce the hair, nerve cells, red blood  cells, and so on.</p> <p>There are probably 500 different cell types, and these each have  specific functions. And, the definition of a cell type really is a group  of cells with a particular function. Something else that's interesting  about turning that single cell into a multi-cellular organism is the  notion of position.</p> <p>So, if you look at yourself in the mirror with all your  imperfections, you likely have your arms coming out of your shoulders,  and your head coming up above your shoulders also. Something has made  the decision to put those parts of your body in their correct place.</p> <p>And that system is a set of positional information. It's kind of like  a map. And as you're going from a single cell to a multi-cellular  organism, there is a set of molecular information that really puts the  coordinates on a map just as it you had a blank map of the world and you  put on the Cartesian coordinates.</p> <p>So you would do that to the developing embryo. So, there's something  called positional information, and the final thing is three-dimensional  structure. And, we'll have a whole lecture on 3-D structure.</p> <p>But, suffice to say for now, cells do not work as single entities.  The blood subsystem, the hematopoietic system, is the only real example  in the body of cells working as single systems. And even there, they  don't really.</p> <p>In all cases, cells group together to form tissues, and is tissues  grouped together to form organs. And, the precise three-dimensional  structure by which they form is really important. So, here are some  examples.</p> <p>I'm going to show you a movie of some stages of human development.  This is taken from material collected a long time ago. And what I want  you to see is that over a period of a few weeks how the sides of the  embryo changes due to cell division.</p> <p>OK, so -- So these are all taken at the same magnification. And you  can see that as time progresses, the size of the embryo changes, and  this was all due to cell division. You can see that shape changes as  well, and this is due to various processes including modeling through  cell death.</p> <p>One of the interesting things about this, and this will be on your  website. You can look at it. One of the interesting things about this is  that early human embryos have a tail. So, you had a tail, a really  pretty good tail until you were about 56 days old.</p> <p>And then, it disappeared. And, in these early embryos, if you go back  and look at this again, you will see the embryo has a tail. So, this is  a manifestation over the tremendous change in size of a human embryo  caused by changes in the number of cells.</p> <p>This cell death, duck feet, chicken feet, chicken feet are not web.  Duck feet are webbed. They start off looking almost identical. And, the  difference is that between the digits, between the fingers or the toes,  the cells die in the case of the chicken, and they do not die in the  case of the duck.</p> <p>And, if you go back and look at this, you will see that there are  little dots between the digits of the chick, and not the digits of the  duck, and those are the cells dying. So, there is a controlled process  of cell death that's very important.</p> <p>Tissues, cell type, this is really one of the most extraordinary  examples in the body of different cell types, and different cell types  working together to a common function. This is a diagram of the retina  that I took from your book, and it exemplifies two things: one, a bunch  of different cell types.</p> <p>These are all nerve cells that are in the retina, and they are nerve  cells that in various ways, either sense light or transmit the signal of  the light once the light has been sensed to other nerve cells.</p> <p>You can see, firstly, there are these different cell types, and you  can see secondly, represented by colors, you can see that they're  organized in layers. There is a very precise and very important layering  of cell types in the retina.</p> <p>If you disrupt that layering, the retina doesn't work. And in many  cases of retinal degeneration, the retina doesn't work because the cells  have, the layering has been disorganized, and the cells can't make the  proper contacts with one another.</p> <p>Position: we talk about axes in the animal, and in the adult as well.  We talk about an anterior, posterior axis, which is the set of organs  from the head to the tail. We talk about a dorsal, ventral axis from the  back of the animal to the belly.</p> <p>And, we talk about a left-right axis from the left to the right. So,  if you look at yourself in a mirror again, you'll look pretty symmetric.  If you were to peel back your body wall and look at your organs inside,  you will see that you are not symmetric at all.</p> <p>You have an asymmetry along your left-right axis. OK, so you will  need to know these terms: anterior, posterior, dorsal, ventral, and  left-right is easy. And, finally, here's three dimensional structure.</p> <p>Here is the heart. The heart is a muscle. It's actually got several  different cell types. But, it is mostly muscle where the muscle is  arrayed in various, precise, organization. And, it's this precise  organization of the cells that allows the heart to pump.</p> <p>How do you get this organization? We'll talk about that later on in  the course. Can you regenerate this organization either artificially, or  in some kind of tissue culture system? Very tough to do, and as you may  know, there is no good artificial heart out there right now.</p> <p>This is a great thing for some of you to think about for your future  careers. It's wide open. Are there circumstances where we could  regenerate a human heart in a test tube or in a large test tube on a  Petri plate, for example? It would have to be a very large test tube,  right, a box, a test box? I don't think so.</p> <p>I think that is really going to be very, very tough to do, and I  think we have to think more carefully about how we are going to repair  damaged hearts. Again, we'll talk more about this. So, what I'm going to  do now is to show you a movie of the development of an early fish  embryo.</p> <p>The kind of fish is called a zebra fish. I work on these in my  laboratory. I have about 10,000 of them there, and I'm going to use  them. Yes, I have 10,000 fish. If you want to come and visit my  laboratory and see my fish, you can.</p> <p>It's a fantastic model system. And, I'm going to use this movie and  this embryo to show you something about the sequence of events that take  place during development. I want you to look for cell division, and I  want you to look for structural changes as you watch the movie.</p> <p>Let's look at the movie again without the music. And let me show you  what you're looking at. So, to zebra fish, like the chicken, and  actually almost like the human develops as a disk of cells, or from a  little disk of cells.</p> <p>I'll show this to you again when it starts again, that sits on top of  a yolk cell. Chickens have got a yolk cell. That's the yolk of egg.  Humans don't. But otherwise things are very similar. Let me try to start  that.</p> <p>OK, good. So, we're going to look at this again. Here is the yolk  cell. This big round ball here is the so-called yolk cell, and that's  going to be the food of the embryo. These two bumps on top are two  cells.</p> <p>This is a two cell stage embryo. And, as you watch the movie for the  last time, and I'll post it on your website so you can watch it as much  as you want, you'll see these two cells divide into four cells, and  eight cells, and 16 cells, and so on, until they've made a little dome  of cells sitting on top of the yolk cell.</p> <p>And then, at that point, suddenly at some point, and this is very  interesting. That group of cells realizes that there's enough of them,  and they start to move. And they spread out to cover the whole yolk  cell.</p> <p>And as they do this, a bunch of them also move to the right hand side  of the board. And, if you watch, you could see stuff happening. And, at  the end of the movie, you could see something that might have been  somewhat recognizable to you as a developing little animal in that it  had an eye, and I'll point this out, and it had a tail.</p> <p>So, let's watch it again and I'll stop it at various points, and I  will point out stuff. Where did my mouse go? There it is. OK, so here's  the cell division. Cells are dividing. They are dividing, they're  dividing, they're dividing, and making this little dome on top of the  embryo on top of the yolk.</p> <p>So, this little group of cells is going to give rise to the whole  fish. And, although humans don't have a yolk cell like this, human  embryos look very similar. And now, this group of cells is going to  spread out.</p> <p>You will see a kind of haze spreading out over this yolk cell. That's  the cells moving. There they go. They're moving, moving, moving,  moving, moving down. And at the same time, a bunch of them are moving to  the side of the embryo.</p> <p>And as you watch, take a look. Here is the high. This oval is the eye  and the brain is going to develop up here. And, watch these little  shiver and shaky things on the side as well. Those are the developing  muscles.</p> <p>OK, and so, there it goes, a lot of shape forming. And, we are going  to move on from there. OK, so go and take a look at this at your  leisure. We are going to talk about some of those processes again.</p> <p>So, let's move on to the next point that we need to deal with, and  that is a point that I've called here cell fate requires differential  gene expression. But, I'm going to state it more simply on the boards,  which are now not responsive.</p> <p>OK, here's an easy way to state this. Genes control development. OK,  well, that doesn't sound so surprising. Genes control everything as far  as you've been told, but let's talk about that in a bit more detail.</p> <p>And, there are three things you should know about this. Firstly, the  function of a cell depends on the specific proteins present. So, cell  function depends on specific proteins. Second thing: all cells contain  the same genes or the same set of genes -- And the third thing is that  only some of those genes are used in each cell type.</p> <p>And, I'm going to use the term expressed, which we've encountered  before. Only some genes are expressed in each cell type. And, I'm also  going to introduce to you a term called fate where the term is similarly  used to the English term fate, but not quite, where fate and  development refers to the final form and function of a cell.</p> <p>All right, so let's see what we have. Here's something we've seen  before, this kind of tiresome diagram that's useful and that should be  really familiar to you, the passage of information from DNA through an  RNA intermediate to a protein product.</p> <p>And, the formation of the final product from the gene is termed gene  expression. Cell types are different because they make different  proteins. We've talked about these three cell types previously.</p> <p>Erythrocytes are so because they're making globin, which carries  oxygen around the body. Neurons are making proteins, which send out the  filaments, and chemicals that allow nerves to communicate with each  other and so on.</p> <p>Number 15 on your hand out, the first slide on your handout, you need  to know this really, really clearly. This is important. And, part of  the deal here is something I'm going to write on the board, firstly,  that in any process of figuring out what a cell is going to become,  there are multiple steps to a final fate.</p> <p>It doesn't just happen at once. And secondly, I want to make the  distinction between regulatory genes and differentiation genes -- --  where regulatory genes, we can rephrase this, control cell fate, and  differentiation genes affect cell fate.</p> <p>They carry out cell fate. And, here is a litany that I've written out  for you that is important that you know. In the life of a cell, as it's  deciding what to become, it goes through multiple stages.</p> <p>It starts off not knowing what it's going to become, and we call  those uncommitted cells. Kind of like you when you came to MIT, you were  uncommitted and perhaps still are as to what you're going to do next.</p> <p>But over time, through the passage of time, you get various inputs  and you decide what you are going to become either as a cell or as an  MIT student. And at that point, you are called committed or determined.</p> <p>That's the jargon. You need to know it. It's very important.  Committed or determined cells have made the decision what to be. But,  they haven't gone on and become the final thing that they're going to  be.</p> <p>So, maybe you are premed, and by now you have committed to being  premed. So, you are different than when you came in here, but you  certainly are not a qualified physician at this point. In order to do  that, you're going to have to go through another bunch of steps and find  your final form.</p> <p>You're going to have to differentiate into a physician or into a cell  type. So, this uncommitted-committed differentiated litany triad is  something we're going to talk about over and over. It's going to come up  throughout the course probably in most of the lectures that both I and  Professor Jacks will give you.</p> <p>During this passage, and you've got the slide, this is the slide you  actually have, is two sets of genes are activated, regulatory genes and  differentiation genes. As the uncommitted cells decide what they're  going to be, regulatory genes are activated.</p> <p>As the committed cells go on to read out the final thing, their final  function, the activation of differentiation genes takes place. So, how  does it work? How does a cell decide what to become, and how do  different cells decide to become different things? Well, this is the way  I think about this.</p> <p>This isn't the way your book thinks about it, but this is the way I  think about it. I think that there is a combinatorial regulatory code  that controls cell type. And so, let's have an example of the three cell  types I've talked about before, your erythrocyte neuron and sperm.</p> <p>And, let's look at the regulatory genes that each expresses. You can  look on the screen. You have this in front of you as a handout. So, I've  arbitrarily said that an erythrocyte is expressing regulatory genes, R,  F, and K, the neurons expressing A, I, and K, and the sperm is  expressing A, F, and K.</p> <p>OK, now let's look at those. Those three groups of three letters are  different from one another. And so, for each of these cell types, there  is a unique set of letters or a unique regulatory code. What's this code  made up of? Well, it's made up of cell type specific factors, or cell  type specific regulatory genes, regulatory gene products.</p> <p>RNAi are expressed in just the erythrocyte, or just the neuron. They  are cell type specific regulators. General factors, K is expressed in  all of the cells, and restricted factors, F and A, are expressed in just  two of the three cells.</p> <p>And, you can do that for any cell type. You can come up with some  kind of combinatorial code of gene expression of regulatory genes that  control cell fate. Now, these regulatory genes will go on to activate  the expression of a whole bunch of differentiation genes.</p> <p>And, usually a small set of regulatory genes will activate a large  set of differentiation genes that carry out the final function. So, here  I've given you an example for erythrocytes. It's, again, on your  handouts.</p> <p>The regulatory code for erythrocytes, RFK, a small regulatory code,  actually it's probably about 20 genes, will go on and activate at least a  hundred genes which will be the gene products that actually carry out  the function of red blood cells.</p> <p>OK, so regulatory genes activate differentiation genes. What's all  this regulatory stuff? What are these regulatory genes? So, here you  have to think back to previous lectures. Remember this diagram? You have  it.</p> <p>You've had it several times. This is the hierarchy of things that  happened from the gene in the nucleus to the final, modified, localized  protein products. You can control, the cell can control gene expression  at any point along this hierarchy.</p> <p>It can control transcription, initiation, or termination, RNA  splicing, stability or exports, translation, the initiation or  elongation. It can control export of proteins to different parts of the  cell through protein trafficking, modification and control of protein  stability.</p> <p>And, there are more. OK, this is some of the list of steps at which  gene expression can be regulated. And, those hypothetical regulatory  factors I told you about in the last couple of slides can be anything  that affect any of these steps from the gene to the final product.</p> <p>OK, all right, so here's another one that you need to know.  Complexity increases with developmental age. And, what I'm going to tell  you about is how as development proceeds, as you get different cell  types forming, you have to make groups of cells with specific regulatory  codes.</p> <p>And these cells -- And these regulatory codes will lead to a specific  fate. So, here's a nice example just by looking at development of an  organ, for example, and this is important if you're going to try to  engineer an organ through tissue engineering.</p> <p>You have to understand there are normally many, many steps involved.  These are the beginning steps in formation of the eye. And, it doesn't  matter what each of these steps are, but if you look at the progression  of cells, each of these lines are groups of cells.</p> <p>You can see that they organized in different ways. They fold. Bits  break off, and you'll end up with a structure that's a lot more complex  just in a pictorial way than it was in the beginning. And that is true  in terms of every aspect of this organ.</p> <p>It is more complex at the end than at the beginning. And, somewhere  through here, you have to increase the complexity of this developing  tissue. So, how do you do it? This is the way I like to think about  this, and this is number 20 of your handout.</p> <p>Here's an egg or a zygote, if you like, a one cell embryo. It's one  cell. There's only one kind of cell there. Or, I like to think in terms  of territories. There's only one territory there. Now, I've also put a  red dot in the cell.</p> <p>And, this red dot can be anything. But it really is in terms of our  conversation a group of regulatory gene products, or one regulatory gene  product. Watch what happens when in my hypothetical example the cell  divides.</p> <p>The red dot goes to one cell, and not the other cell. And so, now  I've got two different kinds of cells. The regulators are in one cell  and not in the other cell. And then, I've gone through this and done it  again.</p> <p>When the cells go to four cells, suddenly I've magically put a blue  dot in one of the cells, and there's a red dot in another cell, and  there's some cells with no dots. And those give me three different kinds  of cells, or if you like, three different kinds of territories.</p> <p>And, for territories, you can read regulatory code, set of regulatory  gene products. So, what have we done? What we have done in this example  is to take a zygote or an egg, if you like, that is symmetric at least  along one axis, and to divide it so that it's now got two daughters  cells that are different from one another.</p> <p>So, there is a breaking of symmetry somewhere in this process. Now,  in actual fact, if you look at the egg, it's really only symmetric in  one axis. And so, it's not uniformly symmetric. But, one of the things  we think about in development is that every time you make a new cell  type, you have to break symmetry.</p> <p>You get two different kinds of cell from one kind of cell. All right  -- So, I'll come back to that diagram in a moment, but I want to, the  fifth point I want to give you is that regulatory factors act within  cells and between cells.</p> <p>Really important, that's why it's up on the screen and it's on the  board. I'm going to tell you about three things. I'm going to tell you  about regulatory factors that are given the term, determinants that work  in a cell autonomous way.</p> <p>That means with inside the cell that carries them. I want to tell you  about regulators called inducers that act between cells or in cell-cell  signaling. And, I'm going to tell you about a subset of inducers called  morphogens, which work in a concentration dependent way.</p> <p>So, this is a kind of magic, and it isn't a kind of magic. The  molecules I'll tell you about our molecules that you've heard about  previously, OK? The phrasing, the jargon is a little different and you  need to learn it because this is jargon that's used throughout biology.</p> <p>Let's first of all talk about these things called determinants. And,  the notion here is that cells become different because of what they  inherit. And, I've drawn for you here, and this is number 21 on your  handout, I've drawn for you here a cell, this blue thing with squares in  it.</p> <p>The squares are determinants, and determinants are some kind of  regulatory factor. They may be one regulatory factor, maybe more than  one regulatory factor. They may be transcription factors. They may be  splicing factors.</p> <p>They may be micro-RNA's. They may be all the things we've talked  about in previous lectures, but I've drawn them as squares. And, here's a  cell with those little squares. And I've drawn it so that all the  squares are on one side and not the other.</p> <p>And, of course, you're sitting there asking, how did the squares get  on one side but not the other? And, that is a really good question. And,  I'm not going to tell you how to get on one side but not the other.</p> <p>But, there is a whole system in the cell of pulleys using things like  microtubules where specific squares, specific molecules, can actually  be pulled to one side of the cell or the other. And then, you're going  to ask me, well, how do they know which side of the cell to move to?  And, that's another great question that I'm not going to answer.</p> <p>But, suffice to say there is a whole molecular machinery that can  move regulatory molecules to different places in the cell. But, let's go  back to our cell that's got squares on one side and not on the other.</p> <p>When a divides, it gives rise to a cell that's got lots of squares,  lots of determinants, and another cell that doesn't have any. The cell  with the determinants goes on to make cell type one because it has a  specific set of regulatory factors.</p> <p>The cell without them goes on to make another cell type. It's not  that it doesn't have any regulators; it just doesn't have the ones in  the squares. So, cells are different because of what they inherit.</p> <p>Here is a fantastic example. These are early worm embryos, early  embryos of Caenorhabditis elegans. We mentioned this last time that  Professor Horvitz in the biology department got the Nobel Prize for it  several years ago.</p> <p>And, this is an example of determinants moving to different cells  during development. So, the top row are cells that have been stained for  their nuclei. And, you can see one cell, two cell, and 32 cell stage  embryo.</p> <p>These bottom pictures are florescent pictures of things called pea  granules. These are determinants. And you can see even at the one cell  stage, there are all located on one side of the cell. At the two cell  stage, they all go to one of the two cells.</p> <p>And at the 32 cell stage, they are all in the cell over here. And,  those cells or that cell is going to give rise to the egg and sperm of  Caenorhabditis, and those pea granules are determinants for the germ  cells.</p> <p>Here's the other big thing. Cell-cell signaling: cells may secrete an  inducer. This is a ligand. Remember signal transduction that you talked  about in cell biology II? Those same ligands that are secreted by cells  bind to receptors on target cells.</p> <p>Receptor ligand interaction leads to activation of signal  transduction pathways, again, from cell biology II. And, that over time  can change the genes that a cell is expressing and changed the fate of  the cell.</p> <p>So, we call these things inducers because of the specific assays  involved. But really, they're ligands, often proteins, sometimes lipid,  that bind receptors, activate signal transduction, and change cell fate.</p> <p>This is number 23 on your handout. So, induction: a process by which  cells become different because their neighbors tell them to do so, and a  variation of induction, oh, here's an example of induction, sea urchin  embryo, the induction is everywhere.</p> <p>But, I've picked this one example. Sea urchin embryo goes on through  time to make this little thing called a pluteus larva. If you remove the  bottom half of the embryo, it goes on. The rest goes on to make a kind  of a round thing with lots of cilia sticking out.</p> <p>And, you can take four little cells that were right on the bottom of  the normal embryo called micro-mirrors and stick them back on this top  half of the embryo that didn't make a normal one. And, it will restore a  pretty normal embryo.</p> <p>And, it's not that the red cells have made all the parts of the  embryo that we're missing, or the parts of the larva that were missing.  It's that those red cells have sent out a signal, and that signal has  told other cells what to become.</p> <p>And, in the case of the sea urchin, part of that signal is something  called the delta protein. This is a micrograph of the a sea urchin  embryo at a very early stage, and this brown-purple group of cells here  are those cells that contain the delta protein.</p> <p>These are the micro-mirrors, and these are involved in inducing the  rest of the embryo to become what it does. Now, inducers, ligands, can  be tricky. They can act in different ways at different concentrations.</p> <p>And, this is one of the big questions of biology. How do they do  this? So, for example, if you have a lot of an inducer, it may tell  cells to become cell type one. If you have a little bit of an inducer,  it may tell cells to become cell type two.</p> <p>And, we'll talk about in a subsequent lecture the molecular basis for  this. So, an inducer that can induce different fates at different  concentrations is terms a morphogen --</p>
