4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
IT.edu. Cancer is a disease that really needs no introduction.

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
It's a very familiar disease. It's a very common disease.

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:47
 The American Cancer Society predicts

7
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
that there will be 1. million new cases of cancer in this

8
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
country, and that excludes the common forms of skin cancer,

9
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
squamous cell cancer, and basal cell cancer.

10
00:01:00 --> 00:01:08
There's about another million of those. So, 1.

11
00:01:08 --> 00:01:16
non-cutaneous skin cancers in the US this year. Both wide numbers are

12
00:01:16 --> 00:01:24
probably 10 to 15 times as many. In 2006, more than 550,000 people

13
00:01:24 --> 00:01:37
in the US --

14
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
More than 550, 00 people in the US will die from

15
00:01:40 --> 00:01:50
this disease --=

16
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
-- more than 1, 00 each day. So,

17
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
in today's, cancer takes as many lives as died in the World Trade

18
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
Center tragedy. It's a very common disease.

19
00:02:03 --> 00:02:09
It's estimated that in their lifetimes, one half of all males --

20
00:02:09 --> 00:02:18
 -- and a third of females will be

21
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
diagnosed with cancer of one sort or another. So the likelihood is that

22
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
the person sitting next to you, or you yourself will be faced with a

23
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
diagnosis of cancer in your lifetime.

24
00:02:30 --> 00:02:44
 And in this country,

25
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
a quarter of all deaths are due to cancer. Soon,

26
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
probably this year, cancer will be the leading cause of

27
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
death in the United States. It will surpass heart disease as

28
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
the number one killer. So, it's a major disease.

29
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
And that sounds depressing. But by the end of this section on

30
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
cancer, my hope is that you will actually feel optimistic about our

31
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
prospects for dealing with the disease more effectively in the

32
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
future, and I don't mean in the distant future.

33
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
I actually think that within the next several years,

34
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
we'll have new methods, new agents to control cancer much,

35
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
much more effectively. We are already starting to see the first

36
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
examples of these. And I'll tell you about them.

37
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
And before long, we will have many more.

38
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
So hopefully by the time you guys are at the age where cancer is the

39
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
greatest risk, these numbers will actually change

40
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
dramatically. OK, so although cancer is familiar based

41
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
on its prevalence, it may not be so familiar.

42
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
And I hope that is not so familiar in detail. So,

43
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
I thought I would show you a couple of slides which really give you a

44
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
picture of the disease. Lung cancer is a common type of

45
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
cancer. We'll talk about it today. And it's diagnosed like many

46
00:04:08 --> 00:04:13
cancers are diagnosed through radiological methods,

47
00:04:13 --> 00:04:17
through imaging, in this case a chest x-ray or computed tomography,

48
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
which is a serial chest x-ray basically. And

49
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
you can see this mass in the lung. This is lung cancer at a fairly

50
00:04:26 --> 00:04:31
advanced stage. Cancer is a disease of too many

51
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
cells. They often grow together in a mass, a lump,

52
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
and so this is an example of cancer diagnosis, a solid tumor.

53
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
You can also have cancers of the blood, leukemias,

54
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
as well as blood cell lymphomas. And here, you can, again, see an

55
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
overabundance of cells. Here's a normal blood smear with

56
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
red blood cells, these smaller guys which have no

57
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
nuclei, and some white blood cells which are larger and do have nuclei.

58
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
And here, you can see a blood smear of a leukemia patient where there

59
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
are way too many white blood cells, nucleated cells, and they also

60
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
happen to look a little immature. They have been differentiated into

61
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
their fully developed state. Too many cells, in this case,

62
00:05:14 --> 00:05:19
not in a lump but dispersed throughout the blood.

63
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
And leukemias, and some lymphomas, are diagnosed by doing a blood test

64
00:05:23 --> 00:05:28
of this sort. Other cancers are detected through other imaging

65
00:05:28 --> 00:05:33
techniques like colonoscopy as shown here.

66
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
Colonoscopies are now fairly common. They are recommended for all people

67
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
beyond the age of 50 because colon tumors are actually rather common.

68
00:05:40 --> 00:05:44
And if they are caught early enough, there relatively easily treated.

69
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
And here's the normal colon viewed from the inside.

70
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
And here's an early colon tumor called a polyp.

71
00:05:52 --> 00:05:56
And I'll give you a little more nomenclature in a minute.

72
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
But this is an early stage tumor, probably not a malignant tumor.

73
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
If you saw this tumor, you might not actually remove it

74
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
because it might not progress to a full-scale cancer.

75
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
But these days, because they're pretty easy to remove using very

76
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
similar methods as this gentleman here with the colonoscopy,

77
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
one would clip them out, and not risk the possibility that

78
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
they could progress. If they do progress,

79
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
they get larger. And more importantly, they begin to invade

80
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
through the wall of the colon. And this is very dangerous because

81
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
now the cancer cells can spread throughout the body,

82
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
taking up residence elsewhere and causing even greater problems

83
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
for the patient. So, this would require surgery.

84
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
A section of the colon would be removed as is shown here.

85
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
This is a section of colon where the colon cancer is highlighted by

86
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
this circle. And this is a life sparing surgery.

87
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
Individuals can live just fine. So if colon cancer is caught even

88
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
at this stage, an advanced stage,

89
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
but before it has spread to other parts of the body,

90
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
it's relatively treatable, even curable by surgical methods.

91
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
Now, this set of pictures gives you a sense that cancers progress.

92
00:07:08 --> 00:07:13
They progress from early-stage, relatively normal looking tissue

93
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
through much more advanced cancers, including to the point of metastasis.

94
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
And we are beginning to understand this process in some detail both in

95
00:07:22 --> 00:07:27
terms of what the cells look like, the tissues look like, but also what

96
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
the genes look like that are driving these processes forward.

97
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
And I'm now going to give you some examples, or introduce the concept,

98
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
that cancer progression from normalcy to malignancy is associated

99
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
with changes in genes. That's really going to be a major

100
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
theme of today and in the following lectures. But

101
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
histologically, the process looks like this in cartoon form.

102
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
One starts with a normal looking tissue. All of your cells are

103
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
organized in one way or another in tissues, where they have important

104
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
interactions with their neighboring cells: so here,

105
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
a series of, say, epithelial cells.

106
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
Maybe these are the cells that line your gut. They are in normal

107
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
juxtaposition with their neighbors. They are sitting atop what's called

108
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
a basement membrane, proteins that are secreted by those

109
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
cells and other cells to give the cell something literally to sit on

110
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
it, attach to. And then there are other cells in

111
00:08:21 --> 00:08:24
their vicinity including the cells that give rise to these cells,

112
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
the stem cells or precursor cells, of the tissue that will be called on

113
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
to differentiate into these end stage cells when these cells are

114
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
lost, sloughed off. At some frequency in all of us,

115
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
alterations occur in these cells such that an abnormal cell arises.

116
00:08:40 --> 00:08:45
This is a cell which has acquired a change. I'll tell you now that it's

117
00:08:45 --> 00:08:50
a genetic change which allows that cell to do things that its neighbors

118
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
can't do. And in particular, it allows those cells to grow,

119
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59
to divide inappropriately. Your tissues are very carefully

120
00:08:59 --> 00:09:04
orchestrated systems with the appropriate numbers of cells.

121
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
And cancer is fundamentally a disease of too many cells.

122
00:09:08 --> 00:09:13
And so one of the first things to go wrong in the cancer development

123
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
process is this orderly cell division is disrupted such that now,

124
00:09:17 --> 00:09:22
too many cells are produced. And this results in a phenomena known as

125
00:09:22 --> 00:09:27
hyperplasia, hyperplasia meaning too many cells.

126
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
But importantly these cells look pretty normal.

127
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
So to the pathologist, and I'll show you some pathology

128
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
slides in a second, to the pathologist, they would say

129
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
the abnormal cells in number have a normal morphology.

130
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
Their shape looks right. Their internal structures look

131
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
right. Their nuclei look right. This process can continue, and

132
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
probably often does continue until there is a discernible mass at least

133
00:09:55 --> 00:10:00
when it comes to solid tumors, a discernible mass.

134
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
And here we refer to this as an adenoma. And I'll show you these

135
00:10:03 --> 00:10:06
terms again in a minute on the board, in this case, an adenoma,

136
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
a benign tumor. And you heard that were before, benign,

137
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
as opposed to malignant. And a benign tumor is a tumor in

138
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
the sense that there are too many cells. So it's a mass.

139
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
But the cells look pretty normal. In a benign tumor, it's not

140
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
considered to be life-threatening. The cells have not undergone

141
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
sufficient changes that we know for sure that they're going to,

142
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
for example, invade and spread throughout the body.

143
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
And oftentimes, benign tumors are left alone because

144
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
they don't have the potential to spread or to become more aggressive.

145
00:10:39 --> 00:10:44
But some of them do. And through additional changes within the cells,

146
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
additional alterations take place such that now the cells really do

147
00:10:48 --> 00:10:53
look different from the neighbors. Their structures look different.

148
00:10:53 --> 00:10:57
Their overall shape looks different. Their nuclei look different. Their

149
00:10:57 --> 00:11:02
interactions with the neighboring cells look different.

150
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
And the structure of the tissue changes as well in the sense that

151
00:11:06 --> 00:11:11
now, new blood vessels have been recruited into this mass,

152
00:11:11 --> 00:11:15
which was important actually in feeding this growing tumor.

153
00:11:15 --> 00:11:20
This is true cancer. It's called in C2 cancer because it's present

154
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
at the original site where the process started in C2 cancer.

155
00:11:24 --> 00:11:29
And it's called cancer based on these various characteristics: how

156
00:11:29 --> 00:11:33
much the cells are growing, dividing, and also what the cells

157
00:11:33 --> 00:11:38
look like, their shape and their nuclear shape.

158
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
That's a problem. But it's a bigger problem because

159
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
it facilitates and usually leads to the development of these tumors into

160
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
an invasive state. So now, the cells are no longer

161
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
staying where they started. They are starting to move out into

162
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
the surrounding tissue. They break down, degrade the

163
00:11:57 --> 00:12:01
extracellular matrix, and actually start to migrate away

164
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
from the primary tumor into the surrounding tissue,

165
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
into the surrounding musculature, and ultimately into the blood

166
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
vessels. It can move into the blood vessels.

167
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
And once there, they can move throughout the body,

168
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
and escape the blood vessels, and take up residence elsewhere in a

169
00:12:21 --> 00:12:25
process known as metastasis. This process happens at some

170
00:12:25 --> 00:12:29
frequency once started. If it reaches this point,

171
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
it's a very bad situation. Most cancers that kill people,

172
00:12:33 --> 00:12:38
kill people because of this process of metastasis.

173
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
90% of cancer deaths are attributable to metastasis.

174
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
And although we know many of the things that happened over the course

175
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
of these earlier stages, we actually know this process

176
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
relatively less well. And obviously, we need to

177
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
understand it better if we are going to control mortalities

178
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
due to cancer. This shows you some histology.

179
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
These are slices through tumors and other tissue that a pathologist

180
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
would look at, and kind of emphasizes the points

181
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
that I was making on an earlier slide in cartoon form.

182
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
So, here you have a lung. And in it is some abnormal cells in

183
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
the red circle here. There are too many cells compared

184
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
to the surrounding tissue. You can see them in this kind of

185
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
dark blue depiction. And you'll see it easier on your

186
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
computer screens later. But again, these cells look

187
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
relatively normal. There are just too many of them.

188
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
So we call this hyperplasia. These can progress into small and benign

189
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
tumors called, in this case, adenomas.

190
00:13:42 --> 00:13:46
And you can see on the histology that they are rather homogeneous in

191
00:13:46 --> 00:13:50
their structure. The cytoplasm looks pretty much the

192
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
same. Cell to cell, the nuclei look pretty much the same

193
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
cell to cell. And they actually look pretty similar to the normal

194
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
cells that surround them. So this is not true cancer.

195
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
This is a benign tumor. But it can progress to a true

196
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
cancer, adenocarcinomas. And you can see from the high

197
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
magnification view that this looks very different from this.

198
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
The cells don't look the same one to the other, and their nuclei don't

199
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
look the same either. And what you can't appreciate is

200
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
that these cells are also dividing at a much greater rate compared to

201
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
these cells. And so, this is true cancer. And this has

202
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
the potential, then, to spread to metastatic

203
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
disease. OK, so I've given you,

204
00:14:32 --> 00:14:37
there, all bunch of terminology. Let me tell you a bit more about it.

205
00:14:37 --> 00:14:52
 Hyperplasia: too many cells.

206
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
That's all it means. Hyper: too many. Plasia: growth,

207
00:14:56 --> 00:15:03
too much growth.

208
00:15:03 --> 00:15:11
Hyperplasias can result in benign tumors, which are non-aggressive --

209
00:15:11 --> 00:15:17
 -- nondestructive --

210
00:15:17 --> 00:15:23
 And they, at this moment at least,

211
00:15:23 --> 00:15:28
have not spread to nearby tissue, non-aggressive meaning that the

212
00:15:28 --> 00:15:34
cells look pretty normal. They don't look different from

213
00:15:34 --> 00:15:43
their normal neighbors.

214
00:15:43 --> 00:15:48
These can give rise to malignant tumors. And the word cancer is

215
00:15:48 --> 00:15:54
actually reserved for malignant tumors. If you have a tumor that's

216
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
benign, you don't have cancer. Cancer refers to malignant tumors.

217
00:15:59 --> 00:16:05
And these are different in the sense that they are aggressive.

218
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
The cells are much more active. They've changed their shape.

219
00:16:08 --> 00:16:15
They've changed their structures.

220
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
They are destructive, that is, they secrete factors into

221
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
the environment, which break down,

222
00:16:22 --> 00:16:29
for example, extracellular matrix.

223
00:16:29 --> 00:16:34
And they have the potential to spread. They've begun to invade

224
00:16:34 --> 00:16:39
into the local environment, and can't access the blood supply.

225
00:16:39 --> 00:16:44
OK, there are cancers in many of your organs in many different cell

226
00:16:44 --> 00:16:49
types within those organs. In the cancers in different places

227
00:16:49 --> 00:16:54
in your body are referred to by different terms.

228
00:16:54 --> 00:17:01
 For epithelial tissues,

229
00:17:01 --> 00:17:09
skin, intestines, breast, brain, lung, epithelial tissues,

230
00:17:09 --> 00:17:18
we call the tumors carcinomas.

231
00:17:18 --> 00:17:23
Carcinomas, and depending on the particular cells that are affected,

232
00:17:23 --> 00:17:29
whether they are glandular cells or secretory cells,

233
00:17:29 --> 00:17:35
we can give them additional names, for example, an adenocarcinoma.

234
00:17:35 --> 00:17:40
And that's a cancer that looks like the glands that give rise to the

235
00:17:40 --> 00:17:46
tumor in adenocarcinoma. And there could be adenocarcinomas

236
00:17:46 --> 00:17:52
in the different places that I mentioned previously.

237
00:17:52 --> 00:17:58
And there are benign versions of this tumors. And for

238
00:17:58 --> 00:18:04
adenocarcinomas, the benign version the adenoma.

239
00:18:04 --> 00:18:13
 You can get tumors of connective

240
00:18:13 --> 00:18:18
tissues, and these are referred to as sarcomas. And there could be

241
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
different sarcomas depending on where they are found,

242
00:18:24 --> 00:18:29
for example, various types of myosarcomas would be found in what

243
00:18:29 --> 00:18:35
type of tissue? These are muscle tumors,

244
00:18:35 --> 00:18:41
rhabdomyosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas. Another example are chondrosarcomas

245
00:18:41 --> 00:18:51
--

246
00:18:51 --> 00:18:54
-- which are tumors of cartilage. In this class of tumors, which are

247
00:18:54 --> 00:18:58
called soft tissue tumors, were in the news just today as a

248
00:18:58 --> 00:19:02
matter of fact, front page of the Boston Globe if

249
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
you happen to see it. There is a site, a former dye

250
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
factory that was dumping pollutants into ponds and Ashland.

251
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
And they've just determined that the exposure to those dyes greatly

252
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
increased the risk of children to later develop soft tissue sarcomas.

253
00:19:18 --> 00:19:23
Several children then turning into 20, 30 year olds developed tumors of

254
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
this type which fits to the theme of the lecture in terms of exposures

255
00:19:27 --> 00:19:36
leading to cancers.

256
00:19:36 --> 00:19:42
Tumors of the blood system are referred to by different

257
00:19:42 --> 00:19:55
names, leukemias --

258
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
-- in which the tumor cells are in the blood, B cell leukemias,

259
00:20:00 --> 00:20:06
T cell leukemias, erythroleukemias, myeloid leukemias where the cells

260
00:20:06 --> 00:20:12
are in the bloodstream like the one I showed you before,

261
00:20:12 --> 00:20:17
and lymphomas where the tumors are in the lymph organs like the spleen

262
00:20:17 --> 00:20:23
or the thymus or the lymph nodes. So, that gives you some terminology.

263
00:20:23 --> 00:20:29
And I'll be referring to some of this terminology as we go through

264
00:20:29 --> 00:20:35
the remaining lectures. And it's just useful to know as you

265
00:20:35 --> 00:20:52
learn about and hear about cancers.

266
00:20:52 --> 00:20:56
Now, cancer research, over the last several decades has

267
00:20:56 --> 00:21:01
been dedicated to try to understand this process of normalcy to

268
00:21:01 --> 00:21:06
malignancy. How does that happen? And the conclusion from all of this

269
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
work, which I will review for you is that cancer is a genetic disease.

270
00:21:10 --> 00:21:15
What do I mean by that? What do I mean by cancer is a genetic disease?

271
00:21:15 --> 00:21:20
Does anybody want to hazard a guess? What do we normally think of when

272
00:21:20 --> 00:21:24
we talk about genetic diseases? Heritable diseases, predispositions

273
00:21:24 --> 00:21:29
to disease, we talked about several of them previously in the class like

274
00:21:29 --> 00:21:34
cystic fibrosis and many others. Cancer can be a genetic disease in

275
00:21:34 --> 00:21:38
that sense. There can be inherited predispositions to certain cancers.

276
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
And I'll mention some in later lectures. But in fact,

277
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
all cancers are genetic diseases. All cancers arise through

278
00:21:46 --> 00:21:50
alterations in your genes. Those alterations in most cases are

279
00:21:50 --> 00:21:54
not inherited from one of your parents but are acquired through

280
00:21:54 --> 00:21:58
your lifetimes through mistakes or exposures to things that

281
00:21:58 --> 00:22:03
cause such changes. Why do we believe this so strongly?

282
00:22:03 --> 00:22:09
Well, firstly, and this has been known for some time,

283
00:22:09 --> 00:22:15
cancer cells don't look normal chromosomally.

284
00:22:15 --> 00:22:21
If you look at the chromosomes of normal cells, they're all the same.

285
00:22:21 --> 00:22:27
All have 46 chromosomes. The chromosomes have proper structures

286
00:22:27 --> 00:22:34
but when you look at cancer cells, that's not true.

287
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
For most cancers, in contrast to the normal karyotype,

288
00:22:37 --> 00:22:40
the normal chromosomal number in architecture, and this is an image

289
00:22:40 --> 00:22:44
which highlights the different chromosomes by different colors.

290
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
This technique allows us to distinguish one chromosome from the

291
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
other based on the color that it stains with these dyes that are used

292
00:22:51 --> 00:22:54
here. Anyway, this is a normal cell,

293
00:22:54 --> 00:22:58
46 chromosomes. And here's a cancer cell. And it's different

294
00:22:58 --> 00:23:01
in many ways. There are way too many chromosomes.

295
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
So it's a defect in chromosome number. But it's also a defect in

296
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
chromosome structure. And you can see in the boxes a

297
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
couple of alterations here. There is a chromosome 7, which is

298
00:23:13 --> 00:23:17
lacking a little bit of its end. So it's got a truncation. I think

299
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
that's a seven. Actually, maybe that's not.

300
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
Many that's chromosome 24. Anyway, it doesn't matter. And here, you

301
00:23:25 --> 00:23:29
can see, it looks like an ice cream cone: a little bit of paint on the

302
00:23:29 --> 00:23:33
bottom, a little bit of green on the top.

303
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
This is a new kind of chromosome that has been fused by two different

304
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
chromosomes coming together. So this is a translocation. And

305
00:23:39 --> 00:23:43
here's another translocation here. So, chromosomes and cancer cells

306
00:23:43 --> 00:23:46
are often abnormal in their structure. They can have

307
00:23:46 --> 00:23:49
translocations. They can have deletions.

308
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
They can have other kinds of rearrangements.

309
00:23:53 --> 00:23:56
And so, based on this, we know that cancer has defects in

310
00:23:56 --> 00:24:00
its genomes, and ultimately we know in its genes.

311
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
We also know that agents that cause cancer --

312
00:24:05 --> 00:24:11
 -- and we refer to these

313
00:24:11 --> 00:24:20
as carcinogens --

314
00:24:20 --> 00:24:29
-- cancer-causing agents, carcinogens are most often mutagens --

315
00:24:29 --> 00:24:49
 -- agents that cause mutations.

316
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
Carcinogens are mostly mutagens. And therefore, it's likely that the

317
00:24:53 --> 00:24:57
reason they are carcinogens is because they lead to mutations in

318
00:24:57 --> 00:25:02
cellular genes. We believe that very strongly,

319
00:25:02 --> 00:25:07
and it's based on work from many groups over long periods of time

320
00:25:07 --> 00:25:11
that have established this kind of correlation. To sort of prove the

321
00:25:11 --> 00:25:16
point, many, many agents, many, many things that have been

322
00:25:16 --> 00:25:21
suspected to be cancer-causing have been tested to see whether they are

323
00:25:21 --> 00:25:26
mutation causing, to see whether carcinogens are

324
00:25:26 --> 00:25:31
mutagens. And they are tested using assays --

325
00:25:31 --> 00:25:41
 -- like carcinogenicity assays where

326
00:25:41 --> 00:25:46
the compound in question or the agent, might be a physical agent

327
00:25:46 --> 00:25:51
like radiation, is tested to see whether it will

328
00:25:51 --> 00:25:56
promote tumor formation. And this is typically done in

329
00:25:56 --> 00:26:01
laboratory animals. So, you expose, say,

330
00:26:01 --> 00:26:06
a mouse or a rate to the agents in question, and you ask the question,

331
00:26:06 --> 00:26:12
over time, does that promote the formation of a discernible tumor?

332
00:26:12 --> 00:26:16
If yes, then the agent is a carcinogen. OK,

333
00:26:16 --> 00:26:20
and then you ask the question, is the agent a mutagen --

334
00:26:20 --> 00:26:30
 -- using mutagenicity assays.

335
00:26:30 --> 00:26:34
And these are typically done in bacteria because they can be done

336
00:26:34 --> 00:26:38
very, very rapidly. We can ask whether the agent is

337
00:26:38 --> 00:26:42
able to cause mutations in bacterial cells. And the standard assay that

338
00:26:42 --> 00:26:46
has been developed, and is still in use,

339
00:26:46 --> 00:26:50
is to take this agent, drop it into a broth carrying

340
00:26:50 --> 00:26:54
bacteria, and not just any bacteria, but bacteria that have mutation in a

341
00:26:54 --> 00:26:58
gene required for histidine synthesis.

342
00:26:58 --> 00:27:07
 They can't make their own histidine,

343
00:27:07 --> 00:27:11
the amino acid histidine. And so, for them to grow,

344
00:27:11 --> 00:27:16
they require histidine in the medium here, or in the medium on the plate,

345
00:27:16 --> 00:27:21
the auger plate that you grow them. If you were to take some of these

346
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
histidine minus bacteria, and plate them on a tissue culture

347
00:27:25 --> 00:27:30
plate, or rather a bacterial plate, that lacked histidine would any of

348
00:27:30 --> 00:27:35
them grow? No, because they can make their own.

349
00:27:35 --> 00:27:39
You have been given them any. So they can't grow into colonies.

350
00:27:39 --> 00:27:43
You would get zero colonies if you did that. This is due to a mutation

351
00:27:43 --> 00:27:48
in a single gene. If you can create another mutation

352
00:27:48 --> 00:27:52
at that site and revert the abnormal gene into a normal gene,

353
00:27:52 --> 00:27:57
now the cells can make their own histidine. So,

354
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
if you can mutate these cells back to becoming competent to make

355
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
histidine, then if you plate these cells on a histidine minus plate,

356
00:28:05 --> 00:28:10
you might get colonies. You would get some colonies.

357
00:28:10 --> 00:28:14
For every bacterial cell that acquired a mutation at the right

358
00:28:14 --> 00:28:18
site, fixing the histidine synthesis gene, now that cell would be able to

359
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
grow into a colony. And actually, the potency of the

360
00:28:22 --> 00:28:26
mutagen determines how many colonies you get. So, you can have weakly

361
00:28:26 --> 00:28:30
acting mutagens or strongly acting mutagens. And

362
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
as I mentioned, most agents that pass this test will also

363
00:28:34 --> 00:28:43
pass this test, OK?

364
00:28:43 --> 00:29:00
However --

365
00:29:00 --> 00:29:04
-- some known carcinogens fail that test. They clearly are carcinogens.

366
00:29:04 --> 00:29:09
You paint them on the back of a mouse or feed it to an animal: the

367
00:29:09 --> 00:29:13
animal will develop cancer. And yet, when you do the bacterial

368
00:29:13 --> 00:29:18
reversion test, they don't show up as being mutagens.

369
00:29:18 --> 00:29:25
Why is that so? Anybody? Yes?

370
00:29:25 --> 00:29:28
They could be so mutagenic that they block the development of the

371
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
bacteria at all. That's actually a very interesting

372
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36
idea, not what I was thinking of. But it's a good idea. They are

373
00:29:36 --> 00:29:40
super mutagens. So they fail the test for that

374
00:29:40 --> 00:29:44
reason. Anything else? What's different between this test

375
00:29:44 --> 00:29:48
of this mutagenicity, and what actually happens in the

376
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
body? Anybody? Yes? That's good.

377
00:29:52 --> 00:29:56
And I'll actually come back to that. There is another good suggestion,

378
00:29:56 --> 00:30:00
but I'll come back to that answer in a second.

379
00:30:00 --> 00:30:05
The difference is metabolism. Your body metabolizes things that

380
00:30:05 --> 00:30:10
you get exposed to that you eat, or that you inhale, or that you

381
00:30:10 --> 00:30:16
inject yourselves with. It metabolizes it oftentimes to

382
00:30:16 --> 00:30:21
detoxify it or to make it more water-soluble so that you can

383
00:30:21 --> 00:30:27
excrete it. There is a lot of metabolism breaking down or changing

384
00:30:27 --> 00:30:32
the things that you get exposed to. And so, it's been observed that

385
00:30:32 --> 00:30:37
there are certain compounds which are not themselves mutagens but are

386
00:30:37 --> 00:30:42
pro-mutagens. They have the capacity to turn into mutagens.

387
00:30:42 --> 00:30:47
And in the process of metabolic enzymes, they become mutagens.

388
00:30:47 --> 00:30:52
And there are very important carcinogens that fall into this

389
00:30:52 --> 00:30:57
category. And one of them is shown here. This is a polycyclic

390
00:30:57 --> 00:31:02
hydrocarbon called benzoate pyrene. It's a very important ingredient in

391
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
cigarette smoke as well as in barbecued beef.

392
00:31:06 --> 00:31:10
It's a very potent carcinogen. It passes this test with flying

393
00:31:10 --> 00:31:14
colors. But if you do the bacterial reversion test,

394
00:31:14 --> 00:31:19
you don't see anything. And the reason is that in the body,

395
00:31:19 --> 00:31:23
many of these double bonds had to be broken and replaced ultimately by

396
00:31:23 --> 00:31:27
hydroxyl groups to make this compound more water-soluble so that

397
00:31:27 --> 00:31:32
it can be excreted. And an intermediate step in the

398
00:31:32 --> 00:31:36
detoxification, the hydroxylation,

399
00:31:36 --> 00:31:41
is the formation of epoxide. And these epoxides are actually

400
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
highly reactive to DNA. And these molecules, these

401
00:31:45 --> 00:31:50
intermediates, are highly mutagenic.

402
00:31:50 --> 00:31:55
And so, when you make these in your body, thinking you're doing a good

403
00:31:55 --> 00:31:59
thing, you're actually doing a bad thing by creating a mutagen.

404
00:31:59 --> 00:32:04
And it's this that's the mutagenic agent. And so,

405
00:32:04 --> 00:32:08
now the simple bacterial reversion test has been replaced by something

406
00:32:08 --> 00:32:13
called the Ames test named after Bruce Ames from Berkeley in which

407
00:32:13 --> 00:32:18
the compound in question is not just given directly to the bacteria.

408
00:32:18 --> 00:32:23
Its first passed through an extract of the liver, usually rat liver,

409
00:32:23 --> 00:32:28
and it's in the liver where these detoxifying enzymes do their job,

410
00:32:28 --> 00:32:33
these cytochrome P450's that are referred to here are present in

411
00:32:33 --> 00:32:39
abundance in your liver. And so if mutagens are going to be

412
00:32:39 --> 00:32:45
formed, they should be formed in this in vitro extract.

413
00:32:45 --> 00:32:52
And then, one takes the product of that and performs the bacterial

414
00:32:52 --> 00:32:58
mutation or reversion test. OK, and now the things that were

415
00:32:58 --> 00:33:04
carcinogens but not seen to be mutagens can be seen to be mutagens

416
00:33:04 --> 00:33:13
again. OK, but --

417
00:33:13 --> 00:33:30
-- still --

418
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36
There are still some truly non-mutagenic carcinogens.

419
00:33:36 --> 00:33:42
And two examples are alcohol and asbestos.

420
00:33:42 --> 00:33:48
 These do not pass any mutagenicity

421
00:33:48 --> 00:33:52
tests that I'm aware of. But both of them are clearly linked

422
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
to cancer development: alcohol in the case of liver,

423
00:33:56 --> 00:34:00
cancer, and head and neck cancer, and asbestos in the case of

424
00:34:00 --> 00:34:04
mesothelioma, the lining of the lung.

425
00:34:04 --> 00:34:08
So these are not mutagens. So how did they promote cancer

426
00:34:08 --> 00:34:12
formation? Based on the mechanism that was suggested over here.

427
00:34:12 --> 00:34:17
These agents cause irritation in tissues --

428
00:34:17 --> 00:34:29
 -- which results in tissue

429
00:34:29 --> 00:34:38
destruction, loss of cells --

430
00:34:38 --> 00:34:44
-- and their replacement of those cells, cell replenishment.

431
00:34:44 --> 00:34:50
So, it recruits a lot of cells to begin to divide when they normally

432
00:34:50 --> 00:34:56
wouldn't. So it results in increased proliferation,

433
00:34:56 --> 00:35:02
and the increased potential for mutation because -

434
00:35:02 --> 00:35:07
when cells divide. When they duplicate their DNA,

435
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
there is an inherent risk of making mistakes. It's not an error-free

436
00:35:11 --> 00:35:16
process. So the more cell division there is, the more opportunity there

437
00:35:16 --> 00:35:20
is for error, and therefore, the increased risk of acquiring

438
00:35:20 --> 00:35:25
mutations and becoming ultimately a cancer. OK, I want to take a couple

439
00:35:25 --> 00:35:29
of minutes talking about one really important environmental carcinogen,

440
00:35:29 --> 00:35:34
something that we get exposed to. And that is cigarette smoke.

441
00:35:34 --> 00:35:39
I mentioned that benzoate pyrene is one of the important ingredients in

442
00:35:39 --> 00:35:44
cigarette smoke, but it's actually not the only

443
00:35:44 --> 00:35:49
mutagen. There are actually hundreds of mutagens in cigarette

444
00:35:49 --> 00:35:55
smoke. And this is the most important environmental carcinogen

445
00:35:55 --> 00:36:00
that we have in our environments. And it results in a large number of

446
00:36:00 --> 00:36:05
deaths per year. Tobacco smoke is responsible for a

447
00:36:05 --> 00:36:10
high percentage of the 175, 00 people who die from lung cancer

448
00:36:10 --> 00:34:48
in this country each year. About 150 were either smokers

449
00:34:48 --> 00:36:27
or former smokers.

450
00:36:27 --> 00:36:31
And the association between lung cancer and cigarette smoking is

451
00:36:31 --> 00:36:35
really striking. If you look here,

452
00:36:35 --> 00:36:40
the green line represents cigarette consumption in males from the

453
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
beginning of the century, the 1900s, through 1960. And you

454
00:36:44 --> 00:36:49
can see it rapidly increased through availability and social acceptance

455
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
and social trends. Smoking was really rampant in the

456
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
society. And shortly thereafter, with about a 20 year lag, you could

457
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
see that lung cancer risk increased dramatically as well,

458
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
which is directly attributable to the cigarette smoke exposure.

459
00:37:07 --> 00:37:10
It took time because cancers don't develop right away.

460
00:37:10 --> 00:37:13
They develop over years, and so you need to get exposed to

461
00:37:13 --> 00:37:17
stuff over a long period of time. But eventually the lung cancer

462
00:37:17 --> 00:37:20
started to rise. And you could see the shape of the

463
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
curves are virtually identical. You can also see that the smoking

464
00:37:24 --> 00:37:27
rate has dropped off a little bit in men, and actually has dropped off a

465
00:37:27 --> 00:37:31
little bit starting about 15 to 20 years ago with respect to

466
00:37:31 --> 00:37:35
lung cancers as well. So smoking cessation has an effect.

467
00:37:35 --> 00:37:39
If you reduce the exposure, you can reduce your risk.

468
00:37:39 --> 00:37:44
That's true of men. Women have not caught up yet.

469
00:37:44 --> 00:37:48
Women started smoking later than men, about 20 years later,

470
00:37:48 --> 00:37:53
and their lung cancer rates followed, then, their increases in cigarette

471
00:37:53 --> 00:37:57
smoking with about a 20 year lag, and you can see now that lung cancer

472
00:37:57 --> 00:38:02
among women is still rising. And it recently passed breast cancer

473
00:38:02 --> 00:38:08
as the most common type of cancer deaths among women.

474
00:38:08 --> 00:38:13
So lung cancer is a major disease and is directly related to smoking

475
00:38:13 --> 00:38:19
and smoking history. Surprisingly, given that fact --

476
00:38:19 --> 00:38:32
 -- still 47 million Americans smoke,

477
00:38:32 --> 00:38:38
in recent polls something like 26% of men and 22% of women,

478
00:38:38 --> 00:38:44
a remarkably high number. And if you go to other countries,

479
00:38:44 --> 00:38:50
the numbers are worse. So the message clearly has not been

480
00:38:50 --> 00:38:56
adequately delivered. But what is even more surprising to

481
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
me was the results of a survey done in 2002 where high school students

482
00:39:02 --> 00:39:13
are asked whether they smoked.

483
00:39:13 --> 00:39:18
What do you think? What percentage of American high

484
00:39:18 --> 00:39:23
school students smoke? Anybody? It was 28%; more than one

485
00:39:23 --> 00:39:28
in four smoke. And I've heard recently that the

486
00:39:28 --> 00:39:33
number is increasing since 2002. So, this very,

487
00:39:33 --> 00:39:38
very detrimental agent which one controls oneself is clearly not

488
00:39:38 --> 00:39:42
going away and will lead to, unfortunately, the deaths of many of

489
00:39:42 --> 00:39:47
these individuals because of lung cancer. And by the way,

490
00:39:47 --> 00:39:52
it's not just lung cancer that smoking is a problem for: emphysema,

491
00:39:52 --> 00:39:56
heart disease, and other diseases as well. I read a statistic which was

492
00:39:56 --> 00:40:01
really shocking to me. Of that however many billions of

493
00:40:01 --> 00:40:06
people are present on the planet today, the 500 million of them will

494
00:40:06 --> 00:40:11
die early because of complications of cigarette smoking.

495
00:40:11 --> 00:40:16
500 million people will live less than their full lifespans because of

496
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
cigarette smoke. So, if you learn nothing else from

497
00:40:22 --> 00:40:28
this class, if you currently smoke, stop. And if you don't smoke, don't

498
00:40:28 --> 00:40:33
start. OK, that was my little sermon.

499
00:40:33 --> 00:40:39
Hopefully it had some effect. And it provides a segue into --

500
00:40:39 --> 00:40:48
 -- the sources of the mutations that

501
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53
occur in genes during cancer progression. We've just been

502
00:40:53 --> 00:40:58
discussing exogenous, or environmental mutagens,

503
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
cigarette smoke being one, some lead exposure being another,

504
00:41:03 --> 00:41:08
dietary carcinogens I mentioned, environmental pollutants like the

505
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
dyes in the ponds and ash land. They are common. They do certainly

506
00:41:14 --> 00:41:19
have an effect, but there are probably somewhat

507
00:41:19 --> 00:41:24
overblown except for some light and tobacco smoke,

508
00:41:24 --> 00:41:29
and then these rare instances of high exposure to very,

509
00:41:29 --> 00:41:38
very toxic things.

510
00:41:38 --> 00:41:42
A more common problem are replication errors,

511
00:41:42 --> 00:41:46
mistakes that your cells make in duplicating their DNA.

512
00:41:46 --> 00:41:50
They put in the wrong base or they skip a base, or other errors take

513
00:41:50 --> 00:41:58
place during DNA duplication.

514
00:41:58 --> 00:42:03
Your DNA can break inside of your cells as it gets moved around from

515
00:42:03 --> 00:42:08
place to place or because of an exposure to certain things from the

516
00:42:08 --> 00:42:13
outside. And then this can lead to translocations or deletions or other

517
00:42:13 --> 00:42:18
rearrangements. And I'll tell you later about how

518
00:42:18 --> 00:42:24
those can lead to cancer-causing mutations.

519
00:42:24 --> 00:42:38
 Defects in chromosome segregation,

520
00:42:38 --> 00:42:43
dividing the number of chromosomes properly between cells,

521
00:42:43 --> 00:42:48
is another problem. And I shown you an example of that.

522
00:42:48 --> 00:42:52
Here you can see that the number of chromosomes is also wrong in

523
00:42:52 --> 00:42:57
addition to their structure. So, defects in chromosome

524
00:42:57 --> 00:43:02
segregation are a problem in cancer. Defects in DNA repair processes can

525
00:43:02 --> 00:43:25
then facilitate further mutations.

526
00:43:25 --> 00:43:29
And various metabolic processes can produce mutagens insider cells like

527
00:43:29 --> 00:43:33
super oxide molecules which are very reactive and very mutagenic.

528
00:43:33 --> 00:43:36
Your cells have ways of detoxifying, but they're not always perfect. You

529
00:43:36 --> 00:43:40
can also take antioxidants to try to reduce your risk of getting this

530
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
kind of exposure. But nevertheless,

531
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
these endogenously produced mutagens are another common source of

532
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
mutations in cancer. So, we get exposed to things.

533
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
We produce things, we make mistakes, and in our cells,

534
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00
alterations occur in cellular genes which drive this process forward.

535
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
And overall, therefore, we observe a clonal evolution of

536
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08
more and more abnormal cells in the development of cancer.

537
00:44:08 --> 00:44:13
And that's captured here. Clonal evolution from a normal cell,

538
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
a cell that acquires a single mutation, this cell now has

539
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
increased capacity to divide. So it divides more. More of its

540
00:44:21 --> 00:44:26
progeny are produced. We are maybe in the stage of

541
00:44:26 --> 00:44:30
hyperplasia here. And within this increased mass of

542
00:44:30 --> 00:44:35
cells, another mutation occurs. Now the cell has even greater

543
00:44:35 --> 00:44:39
capacity to divide or begin to act abnormally relative to its neighbors.

544
00:44:39 --> 00:44:43
It begins to grow. And within this increased

545
00:44:43 --> 00:44:48
collection of cells, yet another mutation occurs.

546
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
There is a clonal evolution of more and more abnormal cells.

547
00:44:52 --> 00:44:57
And we know that cancers, in fact, have acquired many,

548
00:44:57 --> 00:45:01
many changes in their DNA as evidenced by the chromosomes,

549
00:45:01 --> 00:45:05
but also as evidenced by our knowledge of the sequence of key

550
00:45:05 --> 00:45:11
genes that are affected in cancer. Now, as we'll discuss,

551
00:45:11 --> 00:45:17
many of these genes affect proliferation --

552
00:45:17 --> 00:45:29
 -- and cell death.

553
00:45:29 --> 00:45:33
Again, cancer is a disease of cell number, too many cells.

554
00:45:33 --> 00:45:37
And this process is normally very carefully balanced inside of your

555
00:45:37 --> 00:45:41
bodies inside of your tissues. There is an equal balance between

556
00:45:41 --> 00:45:48
proliferation --

557
00:45:48 --> 00:45:52
-- and cell death so that in normal homeostasis --

558
00:45:52 --> 00:46:00
 -- you have the appropriate members

559
00:46:00 --> 00:46:04
of cells produced as die off, and so that ultimately you are in

560
00:46:04 --> 00:46:09
balance. But in cancer, the balance is shifted. It's

561
00:46:09 --> 00:46:13
shifted in the direction of proliferation,

562
00:46:13 --> 00:46:18
and away from cell death. And the consequences of that are

563
00:46:18 --> 00:46:22
that you've now produced too many cells for the tissue,

564
00:46:22 --> 00:46:27
too many cells in the gut, too many cells in the blood.

565
00:46:27 --> 00:46:31
And these cells, then, accumulate and acquire additional changes that

566
00:46:31 --> 00:46:36
imbue them with those qualities that advanced malignancies have.

567
00:46:36 --> 00:46:40
Increased proliferation is one thing, but importantly it's not the only

568
00:46:40 --> 00:46:45
thing. Increased proliferation and cell death are important qualities

569
00:46:45 --> 00:46:49
for sure. But also as I mentioned, cancer cells develop in other ways

570
00:46:49 --> 00:46:54
that are important in the development of malignancies.

571
00:46:54 --> 00:46:58
Today, for example, a recruit a blood supply. They secrete factors

572
00:46:58 --> 00:47:03
that cause the blood vessels to grow into them, to feed the tumor.

573
00:47:03 --> 00:47:07
They increased their motility. Cancer cells move around. They

574
00:47:07 --> 00:47:11
move into tissue. They move into the bloodstream.

575
00:47:11 --> 00:47:15
They move back out again. And that's what this intravasation term

576
00:47:15 --> 00:47:19
means, moving into the blood supply, and other characteristics as well,

577
00:47:19 --> 00:47:23
how they remodel the extracellular matrix, or how they avoid the immune

578
00:47:23 --> 00:47:27
system, all sorts of things that cancer cells require in order to

579
00:47:27 --> 00:47:31
survive to get bigger, to thrive, are acquired through

580
00:47:31 --> 00:47:35
alterations in cellular genes. Now, the final thing,

581
00:47:35 --> 00:47:39
and I'll close with this and pick it up again next time,

582
00:47:39 --> 00:47:44
the final thing that convinces us that cancer is a disease of your

583
00:47:44 --> 00:47:48
genes is that we've now sequenced the genes of cancer cells and have

584
00:47:48 --> 00:47:53
found alterations. Like in this gene here that you've

585
00:47:53 --> 00:47:57
been exposed to, the RAS gene, in which in normal

586
00:47:57 --> 00:48:02
cells we see one sequence and in cancer cells we see a different

587
00:48:02 --> 00:48:06
sequence, and we can understand that as a change in the activity of this

588
00:48:06 --> 00:48:11
important signaling protein that causes cells to divide

589
00:48:11 --> 48:14
inappropriately. And I'll stop there.
