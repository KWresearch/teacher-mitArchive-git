<p></p> <p>It's a very familiar disease. It's a very common disease. The  American Cancer Society predicts that there will be 1.4 million new  cases of cancer in this country, and that excludes the common forms of  skin cancer, squamous cell cancer, and basal cell cancer.</p> <p>There's about another million of those. So, 1.4 non-cutaneous skin  cancers in the US this year. Both wide numbers are probably 10 to 15  times as many. In 2006, more than 550,000 people in the US -- More than  550,000 people in the US will die from this disease --- more than 1,500  each day.</p> <p>So, in today's, cancer takes as many lives as died in the World Trade  Center tragedy. It's a very common disease. It's estimated that in  their lifetimes, one half of all males -- and a third of females will be  diagnosed with cancer of one sort or another.</p> <p>So the likelihood is that the person sitting next to you, or you  yourself will be faced with a diagnosis of cancer in your lifetime. And  in this country, a quarter of all deaths are due to cancer. Soon,  probably this year, cancer will be the leading cause of death in the  United States.</p> <p>It will surpass heart disease as the number one killer. So, it's a  major disease. And that sounds depressing. But by the end of this  section on cancer, my hope is that you will actually feel optimistic  about our prospects for dealing with the disease more effectively in the  future, and I don't mean in the distant future.</p> <p>I actually think that within the next several years, we'll have new  methods, new agents to control cancer much, much more effectively. We  are already starting to see the first examples of these. And I'll tell  you about them.</p> <p>And before long, we will have many more. So hopefully by the time you  guys are at the age where cancer is the greatest risk, these numbers  will actually change dramatically. OK, so although cancer is familiar  based on its prevalence, it may not be so familiar.</p> <p>And I hope that is not so familiar in detail. So, I thought I would  show you a couple of slides which really give you a picture of the  disease. Lung cancer is a common type of cancer. We'll talk about it  today.</p> <p>And it's diagnosed like many cancers are diagnosed through  radiological methods, through imaging, in this case a chest x-ray or  computer tomography which is a serial chest x-ray basically. And, you  can see this mass in the lung.</p> <p>This is lung cancer at a fairly advanced stage. Cancer is a disease  of too many cells. They often grow together in a mass, a lump, and so  this is an example of cancer diagnosis, a solid tumor. You can also have  cancers of the blood, leukemias, as well as blood cell lymphomas.</p> <p>And here, you can, again, see an overabundance of cells. Here's a  normal blood smear with red blood cells, these smaller guys which have  no nuclei, and some white blood cells which are larger and do have  nuclei.</p> <p>And here, you can see a blood smear of a leukemia patient where there  are way too many white blood cells, nucleated cells, and they also  happen to look a little immature. They have been differentiated into  their fully developed state.</p> <p>Too many cells, in this case, not in a lump but dispersed throughout  the blood. And leukemias, and some lymphomas, are diagnosed by doing a  blood test of this sort. Other cancers are detected through other  imaging techniques like colonoscopy as shown here.</p> <p>Colonoscopies are now fairly common. They are recommended for all  people beyond the age of 50 because colon tumors are actually rather  common. And if they are caught early enough, there relatively easily  treated.</p> <p>And here's the normal colon viewed from the inside. And here's an  early colon tumor called a polyp. And I'll give you a little more  nomenclature in a minute. But this is an early stage tumor, probably not  a malignant tumor.</p> <p>If you saw this tumor, you might not actually remove it because it  might not progress to a full-scale cancer. But, these days, because  they're pretty easy to remove using very similar methods as this  gentleman here with the colonoscopy, one would clip them out, and not  risk the possibility that they could progress.</p> <p>If they do progress, they get larger. And more importantly, they  begin to invade through the wall of the colon. And this is very  dangerous because now the cancer cells can spread throughout the body,  taking up residence elsewhere and causing even greater problems for the  patient.</p> <p>So, this would require surgery. A section of the colon would be  removed as is shown here. This is a section of colon where the colon  cancer is highlighted by this circle. And, this is a life sparing  surgery.</p> <p>Individuals can live just fine. So if colon cancer is caught even at  this stage, an advanced stage, but before it has spread to other parts  of the body, it's relatively treatable, even curable by surgical  methods.</p> <p>Now, this set of pictures gives you a sense that cancers progress.  They progress from early-stage, relatively normal looking tissue through  much more advanced cancers, including to the point of metastasis.</p> <p>And we are beginning to understand this process in some detail both  in terms of what the cells look like, the tissues look like, but also  what the genes look like that are driving these processes forward.</p> <p>And I'm now going to give you some examples, or introduce the  concept, that cancer progression from normalcy to malignancy is  associated with changes in genes. That's really going to be a major  theme of today and in the following lectures.</p> <p>But, histologically, the process looks like this in cartoon form. One  starts with a normal looking tissue. All of your cells are organized in  one way or another in tissues, where they have important interactions  with their neighboring cells: so here, a series of, say, epithelial  cells.</p> <p>Maybe these are the cells that line your gut. They are in normal  juxtaposition with their neighbors. They are sitting atop what's called a  basement membrane, proteins that are secreted by those cells and other  cells to give the cell something literally to sit on it, attach to.</p> <p>And then there are other cells in their vicinity including the cells  that give rise to these cells, the stem cells or precursor cells, of the  tissue that will be called on to differentiate into these end stage  cells when these cells are lost, sloughed off.</p> <p>At some frequency in all of us, alterations occur in these cells such  that an abnormal cell arises. This is a cell which has acquired a  change. I'll tell you now that it's a genetic change which allows that  cell to do things that its neighbors can't do.</p> <p>And in particular, it allows those cells to grow, to divide  inappropriately. Your tissues are very carefully orchestrated systems  with the appropriate numbers of cells. And cancer is fundamentally a  disease of too many cells.</p> <p>And so one of the first things to go wrong in the cancer development  process is this orderly cell division is disrupted such that now, too  many cells are produced. And, this results in a phenomena known as  hyperplasia, hyperplasia meaning too many cells.</p> <p>But, importantly these cells look pretty normal. So to the  pathologist, and I'll show you some pathology slides in a second, to the  pathologist, they would say the abnormal cells in number have a normal  morphology.</p> <p>Their shape looks right. Their internal structures look right. Their  nuclei look right. This process can continue, and probably often does  continue until there is a discernible mass at least when it comes to  solid tumors, a discernible mass.</p> <p>And here we refer to this as an adenoma. And I'll show you these  terms again in a minute on the board, in this case, an adenoma, a benign  tumor. And you heard that were before, benign, as opposed to malignant.</p> <p>And a benign tumor is a tumor in the sense that there are too many  cells. So it's a mass. But the cells look pretty normal. In a benign  tumor, it's not considered to be life-threatening. The cells have not  undergone sufficient changes that we know for sure that they're going  to, for example, invade and spread throughout the body.</p> <p>And oftentimes, benign tumors are left alone because they don't have  the potential to spread or to become more aggressive. But, some of them  do. And through additional changes within the cells, additional  alterations take place such that now the cells really do look different  from the neighbors.</p> <p>Their structures look different. Their overall shape looks different.  Their nuclei look different. Their interactions with the neighboring  cells look different. And the structure of the tissue changes as well in  the sense that now, new blood vessels have been recruited into this  mass, which was important actually in feeding this growing tumor.</p> <p>This is true cancer. It's called in situ cancer because it's present  at the original site where the process started in C2 cancer. And, it's  called cancer based on these various characteristics: how much the cells  are growing, dividing, and also what the cells look like, their shape  and their nuclear shape.</p> <p>That's a problem. But it's a bigger problem because it facilitates  and usually leads to the development of these tumors into an invasive  state. So now, the cells are no longer staying where they started.</p> <p>They are starting to move out into the surrounding tissue. They break  down, degrade the extracellular matrix, and actually start to migrate  away from the primary tumor into the surrounding tissue, into the  surrounding musculature, and ultimately into the blood vessels.</p> <p>It can move into the blood vessels. And once there, they can move  throughout the body, and escape the blood vessels, and take up residence  elsewhere in a process known as metastasis. This process happens at  some frequency once started.</p> <p>If it reaches this point, it's a very bad situation. Most cancers  that kill people, kill people because of this process of metastasis. 90%  of cancer deaths are attributable to metastasis. And, although we know  many of the things that happened over the course of these earlier  stages, we actually know this process relatively less well.</p> <p>And obviously, we need to understand it better if we are going to  control mortalities due to cancer. This shows you some histology. These  are slices through tumors and other tissue that a pathologist would look  at, and kind of emphasizes the points that I was making on an earlier  slide in cartoon form.</p> <p>So, here you have a lung. And in it is some abnormal cells in the red  circle here. There are too many cells compared to the surrounding  tissue. You can see them in this kind of dark blue depiction.</p> <p>And you'll see it easier on your computer screens later. But again,  these cells look relatively normal. There are just too many of them. So  we call this hyperplasia. These can progress into small and benign  tumors called, in this case, adenomas.</p> <p>And, you can see on the histology that they are rather homogeneous in  their structure. The cytoplasm looks pretty much the same. Cell to  cell, the nuclei look pretty much the same cell to cell. And they  actually look pretty similar to the normal cells that surround them.</p> <p>So this is not true cancer. This is a benign tumor. But it can  progress to a true cancer, adenocarcinomas. And you can see from the  high magnification view that this looks very different from this.</p> <p>The cells don't look the same one to the other, and their nuclei  don't look the same either. And, what you can't appreciate is that these  cells are also dividing at a much greater rate compared to these cells.</p> <p>And so, this is true cancer. And this has the potential, then, to  spread to metastatic disease. OK, so I've given you, there, all bunch of  terminology. Let me tell you a bit more about it. Hyperplasia: too many  cells.</p> <p>That's all it means. Hyper: too many. Plasia: growth, too much  growth. Hyperplasias can result in benign tumors, which are  non-aggressive -- nondestructive -- And they, at this moment at least,  have not spread to nearby tissue, non-aggressive meaning that the cells  look pretty normal.</p> <p>They don't look different from their normal neighbors. These can give  rise to malignant tumors. And the word cancer is actually reserved for  malignant tumors. If you have a tumor that's benign, you don't have  cancer.</p> <p>Cancer refers to malignant tumors. And these are different in the  sense that they are aggressive. The cells are much more active. They've  changed their shape. They've changed their structures. They are  destructive, that is, they secrete factors into the environment, which  break down, for example, extracellular matrix.</p> <p>And they have the potential to spread. They've begun to invade into  the local environment, and can't access the blood supply. OK, there are  cancers in many of your organs in many different cell types within those  organs.</p> <p>In the cancers in different places in your body are referred to by  different terms. For epithelial tissues, skin, intestines, breast,  brain, lung, epithelial tissues, we call the tumors carcinomas.</p> <p>Carcinomas, and depending on the particular cells that are affected,  whether they are glandular cells or secretory cells, we can give them  additional names, for example, an adenocarcinoma. And that's a cancer  that looks like the glands that give rise to the tumor in  adenocarcinoma.</p> <p>And there could be adenocarcinomas in the different places that I  mentioned previously. And there are benign versions of this tumors. And  for adenocarcinomas, the benign version the adenoma. You can get tumors  of connective tissues, and these are referred to as sarcomas.</p> <p>And there could be different sarcomas depending on where they are  found, for example, various types of myosarcomas would be found in what  type of tissue? These are muscle tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas,  leiomyosarcomas.</p> <p>Another example are chondrosarcomas -- which are tumors of cartilage.  In this class of tumors, which are called soft tissue tumors, were in  the news just today as a matter of fact, front page of the Boston Globe  if you happen to see it.</p> <p>There is a site, a former dye factory that was dumping pollutants  into ponds and Ashland. And they've just determined that the exposure to  those dyes greatly increased the risk of children to later develop soft  tissue sarcomas.</p> <p>Several children then turning into 20, 30 year olds developed tumors  of this type which fits to the theme of the lecture in terms of  exposures leading to cancers. Tumors of the blood system are referred to  by different names, leukemias -- in which the tumor cells are in the  blood, B cell leukemias, T cell leukemias, erythroleukemias, myeloid  leukemias where the cells are in the bloodstream like the one I showed  you before, and lymphomas where the tumors are in the lymph organs like  the spleen or the thymus or the lymph nodes.</p> <p>So, that gives you some terminology. And I'll be referring to some of  this terminology as we go through the remaining lectures. And it's just  useful to know as you learn about and hear about cancers.</p> <p>Now, cancer research, over the last several decades has been  dedicated to try to understand this process of normalcy to malignancy.  How does that happen? And the conclusion from all of this work, which I  will review for you is that cancer is a genetic disease.</p> <p>What do I mean by that? What do I mean by cancer is a genetic  disease? Does anybody want to hazard a guess? What do we normally think  of when we talk about genetic diseases? Heritable diseases,  predispositions to disease, we talked about several of them previously  in the class like cystic fibrosis and many others.</p> <p>Cancer can be a genetic disease in that sense. There can be inherited  predispositions to certain cancers. And I'll mention some in later  lectures. But in fact, all cancers are genetic diseases. All cancers  arise through alterations in your genes.</p> <p>Those alterations in most cases are not inherited from one of your  parents but are acquired through your lifetimes through mistakes or  exposures to things that cause such changes. Why do we believe this so  strongly? Well, firstly, and this has been known for some time, cancer  cells don't look normal chromosomally.</p> <p>If you look at the chromosomes of normal cells, they're all the same.  All have 46 chromosomes. The chromosomes have proper structures but  when you look at cancer cells, that's not true. For most cancers, in  contrast to the normal karyotype, the normal chromosomal number in  architecture, and this is an image which highlights the different  chromosomes by different colors.</p> <p>This technique allows us to distinguish one chromosome from the other  based on the color that it stains with these dyes that are used here.  Anyway, this is a normal cell, 46 chromosomes. And here's a cancer cell.</p> <p>And it's different in many ways. There are way too many chromosomes.  So it's a defect in chromosome number. But it's also a defect in  chromosome structure. And you can see in the boxes a couple of  alterations here.</p> <p>There is a chromosome 7, which is lacking a little bit of its end. So  it's got a truncation. I think that's a seven. Actually, maybe that's  not. Many that's chromosome 24. Anyway, it doesn't matter.</p> <p>And here, you can see, it looks like an ice cream cone: a little bit  of paint on the bottom, a little bit of green on the top. This is a new  kind of chromosome that has been fused by two different chromosomes  coming together.</p> <p>So this is a translocation. And here's another translocation here.  So, chromosomes and cancer cells are often abnormal in their structure.  They can have translocations. They can have deletions. They can have  other kinds of rearrangements.</p> <p>And so, based on this, we know that cancer has defects in its  genomes, and ultimately we know in its genes. We also know that agents  that cause cancer -- and we refer to these as carcinogens --  cancer-causing agents, carcinogens are most often mutagens -- agents  that cause mutations.</p> <p>Carcinogens are mostly mutagens. And therefore, it's likely that the  reason they are carcinogens is because they lead to mutations in  cellular genes. We believe that very strongly, and it's based on work  from many groups over long periods of time that have established this  kind of correlation.</p> <p>To sort of prove the point, many, many agents, many, many things that  have been suspected to be cancer-causing have been tested to see  whether they are mutation causing, to see whether carcinogens are  mutagens.</p> <p>And they are tested using assays -- like carcinogenicity assays where  the compound in question or the agent, might be a physical agent like  radiation, is tested to see whether it will promote tumor formation.</p> <p>And, this is typically done in laboratory animals. So, you expose,  say, a mouse or a rate to the agents in question, and you ask the  question, over time, does that promote the formation of a discernible  tumor? If yes, then the agent is a carcinogen.</p> <p>OK, and then you ask the question, is the agent a mutagen -- using  mutagenicity assays. And these are typically done in bacteria because  they can be done very, very rapidly. We can ask whether the agent is  able to cause mutations in bacterial cells.</p> <p>And the standard assay that has been developed, and is still in use,  is to take this agent, drop it into a broth carrying bacteria, and not  just any bacteria, but bacteria that have mutation in a gene required  for histidine synthesis.</p> <p>They can't make their own histidine, the amino acid histidine. And  so, for them to grow, they require histidine in the medium here, or in  the medium on the plate, the auger plate that you grow them.</p> <p>If you were to take some of these histidine minus bacteria, and plate  them on a tissue culture plate, or rather a bacterial plate, that  lacked histidine would any of them grow? No, because they can make their  own.</p> <p>You have been given them any. So they can't grow into colonies. You  would get zero colonies if you did that. This is due to a mutation in a  single gene. If you can create another mutation at that site and revert  the abnormal gene into a normal gene, now the cells can make their own  histidine.</p> <p>So, if you can mutate these cells back to becoming competent to make  histidine, then if you plate these cells on a histidine minus plate, you  might get colonies. You would get some colonies. For every bacterial  cell that acquired a mutation at the right site, fixing the histidine  synthesis gene, now that cell would be able to grow into a colony.</p> <p>And actually, the potency of the mutagen determines how many colonies  you get. So, you can have weakly acting mutagens or strongly acting  mutagens. And, as I mentioned, most agents that pass this test will also  pass this test, OK? However -- some known carcinogens fail that test.</p> <p>They clearly are carcinogens. You paint them on the back of a mouse  or feed it to an animal: the animal will develop cancer. And yet, when  you do the bacterial reversion test, they don't show up as being  mutagens.</p> <p>Why is that so? Anybody? Yes? They could be so mutagenic that they  block the development of the bacteria at all. That's actually a very  interesting idea, not what I was thinking of. But it's a good idea.</p> <p>They are super mutagens. So they fail the test for that reason.  Anything else? What's different between this test of this mutagenicity,  and what actually happens in the body? Anybody? Yes? That's good.</p> <p>And I'll actually come back to that. There is another good  suggestion, but I'll come back to that answer in a second. The  difference is metabolism. Your body metabolizes things that you get  exposed to that you eat, or that you inhale, or that you inject  yourselves with.</p> <p>It metabolizes it oftentimes to detoxify it or to make it more  water-soluble so that you can excrete it. There is a lot of metabolism  breaking down or changing the things that you get exposed to. And so,  it's been observed that there are certain compounds which are not  themselves mutagens but are pro-mutagens.</p> <p>They have the capacity to turn into mutagens. And in the process of  metabolic enzymes, they become mutagens. And there are very important  carcinogens that fall into this category. And one of them is shown here.</p> <p>This is a polycyclic hydrocarbon called benzoate pyrene. It's a very  important ingredient in cigarette smoke as well as in barbecued beef.  It's a very potent carcinogen. It passes this test with flying colors.</p> <p>But if you do the bacterial reversion test, you don't see anything.  And the reason is that in the body, many of these double bonds had to be  broken and replaced ultimately by hydroxyl groups to make this compound  more water-soluble so that it can be excreted.</p> <p>And an intermediate step in the detoxification, the hydroxylation, is  the formation of epoxide. And these epoxides are actually highly  reactive to DNA. And these molecules, these intermediates, are highly  mutagenic.</p> <p>And so, when you make these in your body, thinking you're doing a  good thing, you're actually doing a bad thing by creating a mutagen. And  it's this that's the mutagenic agent. And so, now the simple bacterial  reversion test has been replaced by something called the Ames test named  after Bruce Ames from Berkeley in which the compound in question is not  just given directly to the bacteria.</p> <p>Its first passed through an extract of the liver, usually rat liver,  and it's in the liver where these detoxifying enzymes do their job,  these cytochrome P450's that are referred to here are present in  abundance in your liver.</p> <p>And so if mutagens are going to be formed, they should be formed in  this in vitro extract. And then, one takes the product of that and  performs the bacterial mutation or reversion test. OK, and now the  things that were carcinogens but not seen to be mutagens can be seen to  be mutagens again.</p> <p>OK, but -- still -- There are still some truly non-mutagenic  carcinogens. And two examples are alcohol and asbestos. These do not  pass any mutagenicity tests that I'm aware of. But both of them are  clearly linked to cancer development: alcohol in the case of liver,  cancer, and head and neck cancer, and asbestos in the case of  mesothelioma, the lining of the lung.</p> <p>So these are not mutagens. So how did they promote cancer formation?  Based on the mechanism that was suggested over here. These agents cause  irritation in tissues -- which results in tissue destruction, loss of  cells -- and their replacement of those cells, cell replenishment.</p> <p>So, it recruits a lot of cells to begin to divide when they normally  wouldn't. So it results in increased proliferation, and the increased  potential for mutation because when cells divide -- When they duplicate  their DNA, there is an inherent risk of making mistakes.</p> <p>It's not an error-free process. So the more cell division there is,  the more opportunity there is for error, and therefore, the increased  risk of acquiring mutations and becoming ultimately a cancer.</p> <p>OK, I want to take a couple of minutes talking about one really  important environmental carcinogen, something that we get exposed to.  And that is cigarette smoke. I mentioned that benzoate pyrene is one of  the important ingredients in cigarette smoke, but it's actually not the  only mutagen.</p> <p>There are actually hundreds of mutagens in cigarette smoke. And this  is the most important environmental carcinogen that we have in our  environments. And it results in a large number of deaths per year.</p> <p>Tobacco smoke is responsible for a high percentage of the 175,000  people who die from lung cancer in this country each year. About 150  were either smokers or former smokers. And the association between lung  cancer and cigarette smoking is really striking.</p> <p>If you look here, the green line represents cigarette consumption in  males from the beginning of the century, the 1900s, through 1960. And  you can see it rapidly increased through availability and social  acceptance and social trends.</p> <p>Smoking was really rampant in the society. And shortly thereafter,  with about a 20 year lag, you could see that lung cancer risk increased  dramatically as well, which is directly attributable to the cigarette  smoke exposure.</p> <p>It took time because cancers don't develop right away. They develop  over years, and so you need to get exposed to stuff over a long period  of time. But eventually the lung cancer started to rise. And you could  see the shape of the curves are virtually identical.</p> <p>You can also see that the smoking rate has dropped off a little bit  in men, and actually has dropped off a little bit starting about 15 to  20 years ago with respect to lung cancers as well. So smoking cessation  has an effect.</p> <p>If you reduce the exposure, you can reduce your risk. That's true of  men. Women have not caught up yet. Women started smoking later than men,  about 20 years later, and their lung cancer rates followed, then, their  increases in cigarette smoking with about a 20 year lag, and you can  see now that lung cancer among women is still rising.</p> <p>And it recently passed breast cancer as the most common type of  cancer deaths among women. So lung cancer is a major disease and is  directly related to smoking and smoking history. Surprisingly, given  that fact -- still 47 million Americans smoke, in recent polls something  like 26% of men and 22% of women, a remarkably high number.</p> <p>And if you go to other countries, the numbers are worse. So the  message clearly has not been adequately delivered. But what is even more  surprising to me was the results of a survey done in 2002 where high  school students are asked whether they smoked.</p> <p>What do you think? What percentage of American high school students  smoke? Anybody? It was 28%; more than one in four smoke. And I've heard  recently that the number is increasing since 2002. So, this very, very  detrimental agent which one controls oneself is clearly not going away  and will lead to, unfortunately, the deaths of many of these individuals  because of lung cancer.</p> <p>And by the way, it's not just lung cancer that smoking is a problem  for: emphysema, heart disease, and other diseases as well. I read a  statistic which was really shocking to me. Of that however many billions  of people are present on the planet today, the 500 million of them will  die early because of complications of cigarette smoking.</p> <p>500 million people will live less than their full lifespans because  of cigarette smoke. So, if you learn nothing else from this class, if  you currently smoke, stop. And if you don't smoke, don't start.</p> <p>OK, that was my little sermon. Hopefully it had some effect. And it  provides a segue into -- the sources of the mutations that occur in  genes during cancer progression. We've just been discussing exogenous,  or environmental mutagens, cigarette smoke being one, some lead exposure  being another, dietary carcinogens I mentioned, environmental  pollutants like the dyes in the ponds and ash land.</p> <p>They are common. They do certainly have an effect, but there are  probably somewhat overblown except for some light and tobacco smoke, and  then these rare instances of high exposure to very, very toxic things.</p> <p>A more common problem are replication errors, mistakes that your  cells make in duplicating their DNA. They put in the wrong base or they  skip a base, or other errors take place during DNA duplication.</p> <p>Your DNA can break inside of your cells as it gets moved around from  place to place or because of an exposure to certain things from the  outside. And then this can lead to translocations or deletions or other  rearrangements.</p> <p>And I'll tell you later about how those can lead to cancer-causing  mutations. Defects in chromosome segregation, dividing the number of  chromosomes properly between cells, is another problem. And I shown you  an example of that.</p> <p>Here you can see that the number of chromosomes is also wrong in  addition to their structure. So, defects in chromosome segregation are a  problem in cancer. Defects in DNA repair processes can then facilitate  further mutations.</p> <p>And various metabolic processes can produce mutagens insider cells  like super oxide molecules which are very reactive and very mutagenic.  Your cells have ways of detoxifying, but they're not always perfect.</p> <p>You can also take antioxidants to try to reduce your risk of getting  this kind of exposure. But nevertheless, these endogenously produced  mutagens are another common source of mutations in cancer. So, we get  exposed to things.</p> <p>We produce things, we make mistakes, and in our cells, alterations  occur in cellular genes which drive this process forward. And overall,  therefore, we observe a clonal evolution of more and more abnormal cells  in the development of cancer.</p> <p>And that's captured here. Clonal evolution from a normal cell, a cell  that acquires a single mutation, this cell now has increased capacity  to divide. So it divides more. More of its progeny are produced.</p> <p>We are maybe in the stage of hyperplasia here. And within this  increased mass of cells, another mutation occurs. Now the cell has even  greater capacity to divide or begin to act abnormally relative to its  neighbors.</p> <p>It begins to grow. And within this increased collection of cells, yet  another mutation occurs. There is a clonal evolution of more and more  abnormal cells. And we know that cancers, in fact, have acquired many,  many changes in their DNA as evidenced by the chromosomes, but also as  evidenced by our knowledge of the sequence of key genes that are  affected in cancer.</p> <p>Now, as we'll discuss, many of these genes affect proliferation --  and cell death. Again, cancer is a disease of cell number, too many  cells. And this process is normally very carefully balanced inside of  your bodies inside of your tissues.</p> <p>There is an equal balance between proliferation -- and cell death so  that in normal homeostasis -- you have the appropriate members of cells  produced as die off, and so that ultimately you are in balance.</p> <p>But in cancer, the balance is shifted. It's shifted in the direction  of proliferation, and away from cell death. And the consequences of that  are that you've now produced too many cells for the tissue, too many  cells in the gut, too many cells in the blood.</p> <p>And these cells, then, accumulate and acquire additional changes that  imbue them with those qualities that advanced malignancies have.  Increased proliferation is one thing, but importantly it's not the only  thing.</p> <p>Increased proliferation and cell death are important qualities for  sure. But also as I mentioned, cancer cells develop in other ways that  are important in the development of malignancies. Today, for example, a  recruit a blood supply.</p> <p>They secrete factors that cause the blood vessels to grow into them,  to feed the tumor. They increased their motility. Cancer cells move  around. They move into tissue. They move into the bloodstream.</p> <p>They move back out again. And that's what this intravasation term  means, moving into the blood supply, and other characteristics as well,  how they remodel the extracellular matrix, or how they avoid the immune  system, all sorts of things that cancer cells require in order to  survive to get bigger, to thrive, are acquired through alterations in  cellular genes.</p> <p>Now, the final thing, and I'll close with this and pick it up again  next time, the final thing that convinces us that cancer is a disease of  your genes is that we've now sequenced the genes of cancer cells and  have found alterations.</p> <p>Like in this gene here that you've been exposed to, the RAS gene, in  which in normal cells we see one sequence and in cancer cells we see a  different sequence, and we can understand that as a change in the  activity of this important signaling protein that causes cells to divide  inappropriately.</p> <p>And I'll stop there.</p>
