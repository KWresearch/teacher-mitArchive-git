5
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
We're going to continue our 
discussion about cancer and cancer

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
genetics today. One small point 
of clarification:

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
apparently some people were 
confused about my out of balance scales here

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
related to proliferation and cell 
death, pointing out that if there

9
00:00:38 --> 00:00:43
were more proliferation and less 
cell death, then the scale should

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
shift this way instead of this way. 
That's an astute observation.

11
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
It doesn't really matter which way 
the scales point really.

12
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
The point was that they are out of 
balance, which is critical for

13
00:00:58 --> 00:01:03
tumorigenesis. But anyway, 
in review,

14
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
last time I told you that cancer 
cells arise from normal cells over a

15
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
series of events that relate to 
mutations in cellular genes.

16
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
And I gave you lots of evidence 
that things that cause cancer affect our

17
00:01:18 --> 00:01:23
genes, and that our genes are 
disrupted in cancer cells.

18
00:01:23 --> 00:01:28
And I briefly mentioned that we 
have evidence for mutations in

19
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34
cellular genes in cancer cells. 
And I'll show you that again today.

20
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
But all of that brings us to the 
point of needing to know,

21
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
what are the genes? What are the 
genes that are affected in cancer?

22
00:01:43 --> 00:01:48
And this is important to help us 
understand how cancers arise,

23
00:01:48 --> 00:01:53
so from a basic biomedical research 
point of view,

24
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
but also as we'll see next time, 
this information is actually very

25
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
useful in teaching us how to diagnose 
cancer more effectively or

26
00:02:02 --> 00:02:06
treat it more effectively. And I'll 
just show this slide,

27
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
which I showed at the end again as 
a summary. The cancer cells arise

28
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
from normal cells through the 
acquisition of

29
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
mutations in cellular genes through 
this process which we call clonal

30
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
evolution, more and more abnormal 
cells growing out from this

31
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23
accumulating mass of cells. And as 
we'll discuss today,

32
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
these genes affect proliferation and 
cell death, this out of balance

33
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
scheme that I alluded to before, but 
not only these processes.

34
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
And I emphasize this because these 
other important processes get a

35
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
little bit of short shrift in our 
discussions. But angiogenesis,

36
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
this process of recruiting a new 
blood supply in cancer is very

37
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
important, and also an important 
therapeutic target.

38
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
Cell motility, movement of cells, 
as I mentioned, it's important to

39
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
get cells away from the initial 
mass in the process of metastasis,

40
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
and invasion likewise. And several 
other processes are also affected in

41
00:02:58 --> 00:03:03
the course of tumorigenesis. 
So what are the genes?

42
00:03:03 --> 00:03:08
How do we know which genes are 
affected in cancer?

43
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
Well, this set of experiments, 
really, has occurred over the course

44
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
of arguably the last century. 
I'm trying to find the genes that

45
00:03:19 --> 00:03:24
are mutated in cancer cells. 
And many people point to landmark

46
00:03:24 --> 00:03:29
experiments done in 1910 by an 
investigator at the Rockefeller

47
00:03:29 --> 00:03:35
University by the name of
Payton Rauss.

48
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
Payton Rauss was a virologist, 
studied viruses at Rockefeller

49
00:03:41 --> 00:03:47
University. And one day, a farmer 
from Long Island brought a

50
00:03:47 --> 00:03:54
prize-winning hen to this famous 
doctor at Rockefeller University in

51
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
New York because the hen was sick. 
Specifically, the hen had a big

52
00:04:00 --> 00:04:06
tumor in its breast muscle. And 
if you remember, that would

53
00:04:06 --> 00:04:12
mean the tumor was a sarcoma. 
And he wanted the doctor to cure his

54
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
prize-winning hen. 
Payton Rauss said,

55
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
thank you, I'll do what I can, 
and then prominently killed the bird

56
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
in order to try to study what was 
giving rise to this tumor.

57
00:04:24 --> 00:04:43
And he did a famous experiment.

58
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
He took the tumor, ground it up, 
filtered it so that

59
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
there were no cells present in the 
filtrate, and also used a small

60
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
enough pour filter so that bacteria, 
which were also known at that time,

61
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
were removed. So, he had a 
filtrate that contained no

62
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
cells, no cancer cells, 
and no bacteria.

63
00:05:04 --> 00:05:09
And he took this and injected it 
into a non-tumor bearing bird.

64
00:05:09 --> 00:05:15
And he observed over time that 
this bird developed a tumor.

65
00:05:15 --> 00:05:21
So he was able to demonstrate the 
transmissibility of something which

66
00:05:21 --> 00:05:27
could cause cancer in an 
otherwise unaffected animal.

67
00:05:27 --> 00:05:33
Because it wasn't cells and 
it wasn't bacteria,

68
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
he suggested that 
it was a virus.

69
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
And it turned out to be, over the 
course of the next 50 years

70
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
or so, the virus which was 
responsible for this disease was

71
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
identified and given the name 
Rauss sarcoma virus,

72
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
named after Payton Rauss. And the 
structure of this virus was

73
00:05:57 --> 00:06:02
also determined. It was found 
to be a retrovirus.

74
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
 Retroviruses are in the 
 class of HIV.

75
00:06:07 --> 00:06:12
Their genomes are made of RNA, 
and they convert it to a DNA form.

76
00:06:12 --> 00:06:17
We'll learn a little bit more 
about retroviruses in a few lectures.

77
00:06:17 --> 00:06:22
It was a retrovirus, and the 
structure of its genome was

78
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
determined eventually. And it 
was found to contain in its

79
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
genome the genes that the 
virus required for replication.

80
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
And all viruses of this class 
has a very similar set of replication

81
00:06:37 --> 00:06:42
genes. They need to produce more 
virus. But at the end of the viral

82
00:06:42 --> 00:06:47
genome, at the extreme right side 
of the viral genome,

83
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
there was another gene which was 
given the name sarc for sarcoma.

84
00:06:52 --> 00:06:57
And it was termed an oncogene, 
onco for mass,

85
00:06:57 --> 00:07:02
oncology, cancer associated gene, 
sarc-oncogene.

86
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
So, the virus it was found can 
cause cancer in birds by virtue of

87
00:07:06 --> 00:07:11
transferring into those cells a 
potent cancer associated gene called

88
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
sarc. And Payton Rauss went onto 
win the Nobel Prize,

89
00:07:15 --> 00:07:20
actually about 50 years later in 
the early 1960s for this work on the

90
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
discovery of Rauss sarcoma virus. 
And it was extremely important.

91
00:07:24 --> 00:07:29
But it was still a mystery as to 
where this cancer associated gene

92
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
came from. Where did the sarc 
gene originate? Was it a viral gene

93
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
which the virus used in some 
fashion to cause cells to proliferate,

94
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
perhaps for its own replication? 
Or did it come from some other

95
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
source, some other origin? 
And here in the story entered two

96
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
researchers, Mike Bishop and 
Harold Varmus. Mike Bishop is now

97
00:07:54 --> 00:07:59
chancellor at UCSF. Harold 
Varmus is president at

98
00:07:59 --> 00:08:04
Memorial Sloan-Kettering. 
They did this work at UCSF,

99
00:08:04 --> 00:08:09
and I got quite familiar with it 
because I ended up working for

100
00:08:09 --> 00:08:14
Harold Varmus as a Ph.D student.
This work was done

101
00:08:14 --> 00:08:19
before I got there in about 1975. 
And they set out to ask this

102
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
question, what is the origin of 
this sarc-oncogene?

103
00:08:24 --> 00:08:29
Where did it come from? And what 
they were able to show was

104
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34
that this Rauss sarcoma virus 
derived from a virus that was

105
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40
related to it called avian 
leucosis virus.

106
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
And avian leucosis virus had 
only those replication genes,

107
00:08:46 --> 00:08:52
the genes that the virus uses to 
produce more virus what they were

108
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
able to show was that this 
avian leucosis virus,

109
00:08:58 --> 00:09:04
when it infects cells, and 
here's a chicken cell,

110
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10
and here's the nucleus of that cell, 
inside that cell are normal copies

111
00:09:10 --> 00:09:16
of the sarc gene. They were 
able to show that the

112
00:09:16 --> 00:09:20
virus actually acquires this 
sarc-oncogene from the cells that it

113
00:09:20 --> 00:09:24
infects. Now, it doesn't 
do that every time.

114
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
In fact, most of the time, 
the virus just goes in and replicates

115
00:09:28 --> 00:09:39
and produces more virus.
 

116
00:09:39 --> 00:09:44
But rarely, and really it's very 
rarely, the virus actually acquires

117
00:09:44 --> 00:09:49
a piece of the sarc gene and 
sticks it into its own genome,

118
00:09:49 --> 00:09:56
thereby creating --

119
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
-- Rauss sarcoma virus, 
which has the structure that I

120
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
showed you above with the 
replication genes and

121
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
the sarc oncogene. And this 
is done through a process

122
00:10:14 --> 00:10:21
called transduction, which is 
a form of recombination.

123
00:10:21 --> 00:10:28
 The main point of 
 this observation,

124
00:10:28 --> 00:10:32
and the really important point 
of this observation was this potent

125
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
oncogene is present 
in chicken cells.

126
00:10:36 --> 00:10:47
 The sarc is a cellular gene.

127
00:10:47 --> 00:10:53
It's not just a viral gene.
It's derived from host cells of chickens,

128
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
and it's not only in chickens. 
It's in all vertebrates including

129
00:10:59 --> 00:11:04
humans. So, you all have a sarc 
gene in your

130
00:11:04 --> 00:11:09
cells, too. And this was a 
really momentous observation.

131
00:11:09 --> 00:11:14
And it led Bishop and Varmus to 
win the Nobel Prize back in 1989.

132
00:11:14 --> 00:11:19
So, what I've just told you is 
that your cells carry a potent oncogene,

133
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
sarc. So, why don't you 
all have sarcomas?

134
00:11:25 --> 00:11:31
Anybody? Remember,
  

135
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37
we are still being filmed. 
Anybody? Yes, somebody's got their

136
00:11:37 --> 00:11:42
hand up, but I don't see them. 
Yes? Almost right. The gene is

137
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
not expressed properly, OK? 
The virus has co-opted this

138
00:11:48 --> 00:11:53
gene and placed it into its own 
genome. And now this gene is being

139
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
regulated improperly. Maybe it's 
expressed too well or at

140
00:11:59 --> 00:12:05
the wrong time, 
or in the wrong cells.

141
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
And some combination of those 
things allows the gene to cause

142
00:12:09 --> 00:12:14
cancer in this setting, whereas 
when the gene is properly

143
00:12:14 --> 00:12:18
regulated, and the cells of 
chickens or in you, it's not cancer

144
00:12:18 --> 00:12:23
associated. It doesn't cause 
cancer in its state in the cellular genome.

145
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
So, this was extremely 
important, and as I said,

146
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
led to the Nobel Prize for 
these guys. RSV --

147
00:12:32 --> 00:12:46
 -- is what's called an acutely
  

148
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
transforming retrovirus, 
acutely transforming meaning that it

149
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
can transform cells, turn 
them from normal to cancerous

150
00:12:54 --> 00:12:59
quickly. And as I said, 
it's a retrovirus. We now know of

151
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
many acutely transforming 
viruses of animals: mice,

152
00:13:03 --> 00:13:08
rats, chickens, turkeys, other things.

153
00:13:08 --> 00:13:13
And from them, we have learned 
the identity of

154
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
about 50 or so oncogenes, all of 
which were derived from the

155
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
host cell. So, we know from this 
type of experiment

156
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
of many potential cancer 
associated genes. Importantly,

157
00:13:28 --> 00:13:34
there are no known acutely 
transforming viruses of humans.

158
00:13:34 --> 00:13:39
Importantly, the vast majority 
of human cancers are not associated

159
00:13:39 --> 00:13:44
with viral agents. Occasionally, 
there are such cases,

160
00:13:44 --> 00:13:49
but they are quite rare. Most 
major tumor types are not caused by viral

161
00:13:49 --> 00:13:55
infection. But there is one 
big exception to this --

162
00:13:55 --> 00:14:04
 -- human papilloma virus.

163
00:14:04 --> 00:14:10
Human papilloma virus, or HPV, 
and specifically high-risk types of

164
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
HPV called type 16 and type 18 
are associated with cervical cancer in

165
00:14:16 --> 00:14:21
the US, but mostly in other parts 
of the world. And that's important,

166
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
because if one can control exposure 
to HPV, or eradication of HPV,

167
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
one could do something about 
cervical cancer,

168
00:14:33 --> 00:14:38
and that's actually happening 
now. And I'll mention that again next

169
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
lecture. But I want you to 
remember that most cancers,

170
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
human cancers, are not virus 
associated. But the viruses have

171
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
taught us a great deal about 
cancer genetics. OK,

172
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
so if most human cancers don't 
arise from a viral infection,

173
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
the infection with an oncogene 
carrying virus,

174
00:14:58 --> 00:15:03
then where do these mutations 
come from?

175
00:15:03 --> 00:15:08
What are the mutations in human 
cancer? And here,

176
00:15:08 --> 00:15:13
just after these experiments
were done, around 1980,

177
00:15:13 --> 00:15:18
comes another one of our local 
heroes, Bob Weinberg,

178
00:15:18 --> 00:15:23
who has a laboratory at the 
Whitehead Institute here at MIT.

179
00:15:23 --> 00:15:28
He hasn't yet won the Nobel Prize, 
but I think he's going to, based on

180
00:15:28 --> 00:15:34
this work and a lot of other work 
probably in the next several years.

181
00:15:34 --> 00:15:40
And what Weinberg's lab did 
back in this early 1980s.

182
00:15:40 --> 00:15:47
Was to look in human cancers, 
so not cancers of animals, but in

183
00:15:47 --> 00:15:54
human cancers. 
And specifically,

184
00:15:54 --> 00:16:01
they took bladder cancers 
and isolated the cells,

185
00:16:01 --> 00:16:13
and grew them 
in the laboratory.

186
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
They assumed that inside of 
the cells were altered genes,

187
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
and to become altered through 
the life of this individual,

188
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
giving rise to this cancer. And 
they wanted to know what those

189
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
genes were. And so, they 
isolated the DNA from these

190
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
bladder cancer cells, and they 
transfected it into cells

191
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
from mice. They sheared it up, 
and they introduced it. That's what

192
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
transfected means, into 
the cells of mice.

193
00:16:30 --> 00:17:05
And these cells that they put 
them into were fairly normal --

194
00:17:05 --> 00:17:13
 -- mouse cells,
 

195
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
by which I mean they grew a single 
layer on the bottom of the dish.

196
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
There are structures look like 
normal cells as opposed to cancer

197
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
cells. They were relatively normal 
cells. And what they observed was

198
00:17:25 --> 00:17:29
that a small percentage of these 
cells that had picked up some bits

199
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
and pieces of the DNA derived from 
this human cancer began to

200
00:17:33 --> 00:17:41
behave abnormally --
 

201
00:17:41 --> 00:17:47
-- and produced what were 
referred to as transformed cells,

202
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
cells that looked more like 
cancer cells. So they had converted

203
00:17:53 --> 00:17:59
otherwise normal mouse cells to 
what looked like cancer cells through the

204
00:17:59 --> 00:18:06
introduction of one or 
more human genes.

205
00:18:06 --> 00:18:13
And they further demonstrated that 
these were cancer associated cells,

206
00:18:13 --> 00:18:20
cancer-causing cells, by introducing 
them into immunocompromised mice,

207
00:18:20 --> 00:18:28
and observing that over time these 
cells could produce tumors.

208
00:18:28 --> 00:18:34
So these were cancer cells indeed. 
So that's very interesting because

209
00:18:34 --> 00:18:39
it says that there are altered genes 
in these cancer cells that can

210
00:18:39 --> 00:18:45
convert normal mouse cells into 
cancer cells. And then to obvious

211
00:18:45 --> 00:18:50
question was, what are those genes? 
What is the gene that's responsible

212
00:18:50 --> 00:19:08
for this process? So, they --
 

213
00:19:08 --> 00:19:12
-- isolated the human DNA 
from the transformed mouse cells.

214
00:19:12 --> 00:19:17
And I won't tell you how they 
did that, but suffice it to say,

215
00:19:17 --> 00:19:22
it's possible to isolate the human 
DNA away from the mouse DNA in these

216
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
transformed mouse cells. 
They cloned the human DNA into

217
00:19:26 --> 00:19:31
bacteria using recombinant DNA 
methods that we've talked to you

218
00:19:31 --> 00:19:44
about previously.
 

219
00:19:44 --> 00:19:46
And they sequenced the 
cancer-causing gene.

220
00:19:46 --> 00:19:48
It turns out it was just a 
single gene that was providing

221
00:19:48 --> 00:19:55
this property.
 

222
00:19:55 --> 00:19:59
And it turned out that this gene 
was H-RAS, RAS being a gene that

223
00:19:59 --> 00:20:03
we've talked to you about before, 
and important signaling protein in

224
00:20:03 --> 00:20:07
cells. Moreover, they 
sequenced the copy of RAS that

225
00:20:07 --> 00:20:11
was present in the cancer cells, 
and compared it to the sequence in

226
00:20:11 --> 00:20:15
normal cells in the other 
cells of this individual.

227
00:20:15 --> 00:20:20
And they found a single alteration. 
OK, so what you are looking at here

228
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
now is the sequence of the H-RAS 
gene in normal people or in the

229
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
normal cells of this cancer patient 
has a particular sequence.

230
00:20:28 --> 00:20:32
It encodes a protein, H-RAS, 
which if you recall is an important

231
00:20:32 --> 00:20:36
signaling protein that shuttles 
between a GTP-bound form

232
00:20:36 --> 00:20:41
and a GDP bound form. 
In its GTP bound form,

233
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
it's active and signals, and 
then it undergoes hydrolysis

234
00:20:45 --> 00:20:49
reaction. So, the GTP is 
converted to GDP,

235
00:20:49 --> 00:20:53
and becomes inactive. The mutant 
copy found in the cancer cells and

236
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
in these transformed mouse cells 
has been alteration which blocks the

237
00:20:57 --> 00:21:01
ability of the proteins undergo 
GTP hydrolysis. Therefore,

238
00:21:01 --> 00:21:05
the protein gets locked into 
this active signaling state,

239
00:21:05 --> 00:21:09
and stimulates 
proliferation continuously.

240
00:21:09 --> 00:21:14
And that's why it's a 
cancer associated gene.

241
00:21:14 --> 00:21:19
OK, so here we have for the 
first time evidence that a normal,

242
00:21:19 --> 00:21:24
cellular gene gets mutated, 
presumably by an error or by

243
00:21:24 --> 00:21:29
exposure to some mutagen that 
is responsible at least far an aspect

244
00:21:29 --> 00:21:34
of the transformed state. 
OK, so that's very,

245
00:21:34 --> 00:21:40
very interesting. It also 
raises an important question.

246
00:21:40 --> 00:21:45
If you note that the change 
between the normal gene and the abnormal

247
00:21:45 --> 00:21:51
gene is signal-base change that 
converts this alanine residue,

248
00:21:51 --> 00:21:56
sorry, this glycemic residue to 
a valine residue: single base change.

249
00:21:56 --> 00:22:02
Such single base changes occur 
in your cells all the time.

250
00:22:02 --> 00:22:07
It's estimated that the mutation 
rate inside your cells is about ten

251
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
to the minus ninth per cell division. 
And if you calculate how many cells

252
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
you have in your body at any 
given time based on how many cell

253
00:22:17 --> 00:22:22
divisions have arisen, we can 
estimate that there are about

254
00:22:22 --> 00:22:28
ten to the third to 
ten to the fifth --

255
00:22:28 --> 00:22:35
 -- rasmutin
  

256
00:22:35 --> 00:22:41
cells in all of U as you sit 
there now. You are all carrying 1,

257
00:22:41 --> 00:22:46
00-100,000 cells that have 
this very mutation. So,

258
00:22:46 --> 00:22:52
why don't all of you have cancer? 
Why don't all of you have bladder

259
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
cancer or some other form of 
cancer? Anybody?

260
00:22:58 --> 00:23:05
 The reason is that cancer 
 is not a

261
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
single step process. 
Cancer cells arise from normal

262
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
cells to the acquisition of 
many mutations that occur over the

263
00:23:13 --> 00:23:17
lifetime of the individual. 
So a single mutation in RAS is not

264
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
enough to give you a cancer. 
It might be enough to cause the

265
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
cells to behave somewhat abnormally. 
But that in and of itself does not

266
00:23:25 --> 00:23:29
produce even hyperplasia 
necessarily, let alone an adenoma,

267
00:23:29 --> 00:23:34
an adenocarcinoma and 
invasive cancer.

268
00:23:34 --> 00:23:37
It's necessary to acquire multiple 
mutations. So you may have cells

269
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
that are on their way. 
But they are not fully there.

270
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
And hopefully they'll never 
get there. Now, I want to remind you

271
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
that this pathway, this 
signaling pathway that involves

272
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
RAS is something we taught you 
about previously. This should look

273
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
familiar based on the cell 
signaling lectures that we had before.

274
00:23:57 --> 00:24:01
RAS sits right here, this important 
signaling molecule that links events

275
00:24:01 --> 00:24:05
that take place at 
the cell membrane.

276
00:24:05 --> 00:24:09
Sound at all familiar? Yes? 
Transmembrane receptors?

277
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
Growth factor receptors that 
bind to ligands and cause a series of

278
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
events that for example convert 
RAS to its GTP bound form,

279
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
and then initiate a kinase 
cascade of protein kinases,

280
00:24:22 --> 00:24:26
map kinase, kinase, kinase, 
kinase, kinase, kinase, remember the

281
00:24:26 --> 00:24:30
little movie? Moves into the 
nucleus, phosphorylates

282
00:24:30 --> 00:24:34
transcription factors that initiate 
the expression of target genes that,

283
00:24:34 --> 00:24:39
for example cause cells 
to proliferate.

284
00:24:39 --> 00:24:43
And when RAS gets stuck in its 
on state as it does here,

285
00:24:43 --> 00:24:47
these signals are sent 
constitutively so that the cell is

286
00:24:47 --> 00:24:51
being told to divide all the time 
instead of in a regulated fashion.

287
00:24:51 --> 00:24:55
Now, I point out all the different 
components which I've told you about

288
00:24:55 --> 00:24:59
in previous lectures because, 
in fact, it's not just RAS, this one

289
00:24:59 --> 00:25:04
signaling protein that gets 
mutated in cancers.

290
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
Many different of these signaling 
proteins get mutated in cancers.

291
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
It is a very common pathway that's 
affected in not necessarily all but

292
00:25:12 --> 00:25:16
a very high percentage of 
cancers of different types.

293
00:25:16 --> 00:25:20
The RAS gene is mutated at 
about 30% of cancers.

294
00:25:20 --> 00:25:24
30% of all cancers have mutations 
in one of the RAS genes including,

295
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
for example, 90% of pancreatic 
cancer, 50% of colon cancers,

296
00:25:28 --> 00:25:33
30% of lung cancers carry 
mutations in this gene.

297
00:25:33 --> 00:25:36
But other components get 
mutated as well. For example,

298
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
the growth factor or growth factor 
receptor genes get altered in

299
00:25:40 --> 00:25:43
cancers. They become amplified. 
And I'll mention what I mean by

300
00:25:43 --> 00:25:47
that in a second period. 
We observe translocations,

301
00:25:47 --> 00:25:50
these chromosomal alterations 
in different genes,

302
00:25:50 --> 00:25:54
including the transcription factor 
genes that lie at the bottom of this

303
00:25:54 --> 00:25:57
pathway. There can be deletions 
that affect the function of these

304
00:25:57 --> 00:26:01
proteins, make the function 
abnormally, and subtle mutations

305
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
like the one in RAS itself. 
And there are other examples,

306
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
subtle mutations that 
lock the proteins, for example,

307
00:26:08 --> 00:26:21
in an active 
signaling state.

308
00:26:21 --> 00:26:27
So, DNA amplification is one such 
mechanism to alter the function of a

309
00:26:27 --> 00:26:33
cellular gene in cancer. 
And an example of that is in a case

310
00:26:33 --> 00:26:45
of a gene called HER2.
 

311
00:26:45 --> 00:26:51
It encodes a growth factor 
receptor like item number two up here.

312
00:26:51 --> 00:26:58
It encodes a growth factor receptor. 
And when it's present in single

313
00:26:58 --> 00:27:04
copy or two copies per cell, 
it produces a certain concentration

314
00:27:04 --> 00:27:11
of this growth factor 
receptor protein. And it signals

315
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
at normal levels. And that 
gives rise to a normal

316
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
amount of proliferation. 
And this is particularly important

317
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
in cells of the mammary gland. 
Mammary epithelial cells depend on

318
00:27:25 --> 00:27:30
this signaling pathway to be 
produced in the right amounts.

319
00:27:30 --> 00:27:36
Unfortunately at some frequency 
in cancer cells, and specifically

320
00:27:36 --> 00:27:42
cancer cells of the breast, and 
sometimes ovary, an

321
00:27:42 --> 00:27:48
amplification event takes place 
so that now instead of having just one

322
00:27:48 --> 00:27:54
copy of this HER2 gene on the 
chromosome, there are many copies.

323
00:27:54 --> 00:28:00
An error takes place in the 
replication process so that instead

324
00:28:00 --> 00:28:06
of just copying this gene one 
time, it gets copied multiple times.

325
00:28:06 --> 00:28:12
So, now we have too many copies 
of this gene, and therefore in these

326
00:28:12 --> 00:28:19
cells, the concentration of this 
receptor is significantly higher

327
00:28:19 --> 00:28:26
than in normal cells such that 
in these cells, there might be ten

328
00:28:26 --> 00:28:33
times or a hundred times the amount 
of signaling, or ten to a hundred

329
00:28:33 --> 00:28:38
times the amount of proliferation. 
So, the dysregulation of this gene's

330
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
function by making too much of the 
protein, it's an otherwise normal

331
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
protein. There's just too much 
of it, causes the cells to get

332
00:28:46 --> 00:28:50
overstimulated and divide too often. 
That's bad news for cancer. The

333
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
good news is we now have a therapy, 
and I'll put you about that next

334
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
time, directed 
against this protein.

335
00:28:58 --> 00:29:07
 I'll mention another 
 mechanism of

336
00:29:07 --> 00:29:11
activation, and that's translocation. 
I showed you slides of cancer cells

337
00:29:11 --> 00:29:16
that have broken chromosomes or 
rearranged chromosomes.

338
00:29:16 --> 00:29:20
Those rearrangements often 
produce abnormal genes,

339
00:29:20 --> 00:29:25
sometimes fusions between one 
gene and another. Other times,

340
00:29:25 --> 00:29:29
rearrangements of the promoter 
of the gene such that the normal

341
00:29:29 --> 00:29:34
promoter of the gene, which is 
responsible for its level

342
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
of expression is replaced by a 
different promoter,

343
00:29:38 --> 00:29:43
which might give too much 
expression. And that's true 
for an important

344
00:29:43 --> 00:29:48
oncogene called MIC. 
The MIC oncogene is a

345
00:29:48 --> 00:29:53
transcription factor. It's like 
number eight down there.

346
00:29:53 --> 00:29:58
It's a transcription factor 
that binds to DNA and regulates the

347
00:29:58 --> 00:30:03
expression of other genes. 
And it's normally expressed from a,

348
00:30:03 --> 00:30:09
let's call it, weak promoter. 
You don't want to have too much of this

349
00:30:09 --> 00:30:15
protein produced. It needs to 
be produced at normal

350
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
levels. So, we get a certain 
concentration of the

351
00:30:21 --> 00:30:32
protein, which gives --
 

352
00:30:32 --> 00:30:37
-- regulated cell division. 
You get as much television as you

353
00:30:37 --> 00:30:42
need based on the appropriate signals 
in the environment of those

354
00:30:42 --> 00:30:47
cells. In certain types of 
leukemia, one sees a translocation.

355
00:30:47 --> 00:30:52
The DNA is broken and rejoined so 
that the MIC oncogene doesn't have

356
00:30:52 --> 00:30:57
its own promoter anymore. 
Instead, it's next to a very strong

357
00:30:57 --> 00:31:04
promoter.
 

358
00:31:04 --> 00:31:09
And now, again, the concentration 
of this protein is

359
00:31:09 --> 00:31:15
increased. And this gives rise 
to deregulated cell

360
00:31:15 --> 00:31:21
division, same idea. Change the 
proper regulation of

361
00:31:21 --> 00:31:27
this signaling network, and now 
the signaling network is

362
00:31:27 --> 00:31:31
broken. And as I said,
 

363
00:31:31 --> 00:31:35
there are many, many such 
genes that are known.

364
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
We know about 50 or so oncogenes 
from these acutely transforming

365
00:31:39 --> 00:31:42
viruses. We probably know of 50 
more oncogenes because of their

366
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
changes in the DNA of cancer cells. 
And by the way, there's a lot of

367
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
overlap between these two sets. 
Many of the genes that were found

368
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
in the context of viruses were later 
found to be mutant in human cells

369
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
having nothing to do with viruses. 
And RAS is one such example. MIC,

370
00:31:57 --> 00:32:01
actually, is another example, and 
a relative of this HER2 gene

371
00:32:01 --> 00:32:08
is another example.
 

372
00:32:08 --> 00:32:16
OK.
 

373
00:32:16 --> 00:32:21
OK, so the slide is meant to 
reinforce this notion that cell

374
00:32:21 --> 00:32:27
division, normal production of cells, 
is tightly regulated through these

375
00:32:27 --> 00:32:32
signaling networks, and that 
oncogenes function normally,

376
00:32:32 --> 00:32:38
their normal cellular function 
is to control this process.

377
00:32:38 --> 00:32:42
That's what they do in normal 
development. That's what they do in

378
00:32:42 --> 00:32:47
normal individuals. But 
they can be subverted in cancer

379
00:32:47 --> 00:32:51
cells by mutation. It makes 
them act in a deregulated

380
00:32:51 --> 00:32:56
or uncontrolled fashion. There 
is another set of genes that

381
00:32:56 --> 00:33:01
act, in a sense, in opposition 
to the oncogenes.

382
00:33:01 --> 00:33:05
These genes function to inhibit 
this process of cell division.

383
00:33:05 --> 00:33:09
And they go by another name: 
tumor suppressor genes.

384
00:33:09 --> 00:33:13
Tumor suppressor genes function 
to block the normal cell division

385
00:33:13 --> 00:33:18
process or to inhibit the 
production of cells. And they,

386
00:33:18 --> 00:33:22
too, are important in cancer. 
You can think of these genes as the

387
00:33:22 --> 00:33:26
on switch and the off switch 
of an electrical circuit.

388
00:33:26 --> 00:33:31
In cancer cells, 
oncogenes become hyperactive.

389
00:33:31 --> 00:33:36
When the lights switch gets stuck 
in the on state. OK,

390
00:33:36 --> 00:33:41
it gets taped open. So now, 
you're getting signaling

391
00:33:41 --> 00:33:46
through this circuit continuously. 
Tumor suppressor genes normally

392
00:33:46 --> 00:33:51
inhibit cell division. And so, 
in cancer, these genes get

393
00:33:51 --> 00:33:56
inactivated. It's like the light 
switch getting turned off.

394
00:33:56 --> 00:34:01
And the process is normally 
regulated that way, and

395
00:34:01 --> 00:34:06
these get stuck off. OK, so want 
to tell you a little bit

396
00:34:06 --> 00:34:10
about tumor suppressor genes now 
which is the other major category of

397
00:34:10 --> 00:34:14
cancer associated genes that 
we'll cover here. Briefly,

398
00:34:14 --> 00:34:18
just to reiterate that point, 
in addition to the light switch

399
00:34:18 --> 00:34:23
analogy, people often use the 
gas pedal and breaks analogy,

400
00:34:23 --> 00:34:27
or the go signal and stop signal 
analogy. So, I'll use that as well.

401
00:34:27 --> 00:34:31
In normal cells, when they 
receive the signals to divide,

402
00:34:31 --> 00:34:35
they are stimulated to go, 
that is, to divide to make more such

403
00:34:35 --> 00:34:40
cells. This happens in 
development when you

404
00:34:40 --> 00:34:44
need to make more cells. 
It happens in wound healing.

405
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
It happens in normal homeostasis. 
And then, when the process is

406
00:34:48 --> 00:34:53
completed, there are stop signals 
sent. The go signals represent

407
00:34:53 --> 00:34:57
oncogenes, normally regulated, 
stop signals tumor suppressor genes

408
00:34:57 --> 00:35:02
normally regulated. 
In cancer, oncogenes become

409
00:35:02 --> 00:35:06
deregulated. And pushed too strong 
they send constitutive signals.

410
00:35:06 --> 00:35:11
And as a consequence, 
too many cells are produced.

411
00:35:11 --> 00:35:15
And likewise, the stop signs, the 
stop signals are lost so that

412
00:35:15 --> 00:35:20
one produces even more cells. 
OK, so hopefully these are useful

413
00:35:20 --> 00:35:24
analogies to think about these two opposing sets of oncogenes and tumor

414
00:35:24 --> 00:35:29
suppressor genes. OK, so to get into tumor suppressor

415
00:35:29 --> 00:35:33
genes, sorry, this just makes the point, oncogene mutations,

416
00:35:33 --> 00:35:38
tumor suppressor gene mutations. To get into tumor suppressor genes,

417
00:35:38 --> 00:35:42
the second class, an important class of human cancer genes,

418
00:35:42 --> 00:35:46
let me tell you a little bit about this disease which is called

419
00:35:46 --> 00:35:50
retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor

420
00:35:50 --> 00:35:54
of the eye, of the retina. It's not very common. Only about

421
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
one in 40,000 children develop this tumor. But it's very important what

422
00:35:58 --> 00:36:03
it's taught us about cancer genes. And you can see in the normal eye a

423
00:36:03 --> 00:36:09
normal looking retina, and in the cancer containing eye,

424
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
these blobs of tumors. We now know the gene that's responsible for this

425
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
disease, the gene that's mutated in the formation of this disease.

426
00:36:21 --> 00:36:28
And that gene is the gene called RB, named after retinoblastoma.

427
00:36:28 --> 00:36:44
 And this gene functions as an

428
00:36:44 --> 00:36:51
important regulator of cell cycle progression. If you remember cell

429
00:36:51 --> 00:36:58
cycle progression, mitosis, S phase mitosis,

430
00:36:58 --> 00:37:05
the G1 phase, the G2 phase, again, dim memories from earlier in

431
00:37:05 --> 00:37:11
the class. The RB protein,

432
00:37:11 --> 00:37:16
which goes by the name of PRB, this is the protein encoded by this

433
00:37:16 --> 00:37:22
tumor suppressor gene, RB, acts to inhibit cell cycle

434
00:37:22 --> 00:37:27
progression. That's its function. It blocks cell cycle progression

435
00:37:27 --> 00:37:32
literally like the brakes on a car. Now, you might ask,

436
00:37:32 --> 00:37:37
if it's there and functioning, then how do you ever get cell cycle

437
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
progression? And the answer is that this active inhibitor can be

438
00:37:43 --> 00:37:48
inactivated through phosphorylation. When this protein gets

439
00:37:48 --> 00:37:54
phosphorylated, it becomes inactive.

440
00:37:54 --> 00:38:00
 And now, cell cycle progression

441
00:38:00 --> 00:38:14
can occur.

442
00:38:14 --> 00:38:19
It becomes inactive when the cell receives growth stimulatory signals

443
00:38:19 --> 00:38:24
like through that signaling network that I mentioned previously.

444
00:38:24 --> 00:38:29
These signals, then, act on cycline CDK complexes,

445
00:38:29 --> 00:38:34
cell cycle associated kinases that you were taught about in the cell

446
00:38:34 --> 00:38:39
cycle lecture, and these go about inactivating the

447
00:38:39 --> 00:38:44
RB protein, allowing the cells to cycle.

448
00:38:44 --> 00:38:50
In addition, when the cells shouldn't be cycling in the presence

449
00:38:50 --> 00:38:56
of growth inhibitory signals, inhibitory signals are sent to the

450
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
cycline dependent kinase proteins, and they don't function, thereby

451
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
blocking the inactivation of RB. RB stays in its active state and

452
00:39:08 --> 00:39:13
blocks cell cycle progression. OK, so that's how this really

453
00:39:13 --> 00:39:19
important cell cycle regulator functions more or less.

454
00:39:19 --> 00:39:24
And it's a very important human tumor suppressor gene,

455
00:39:24 --> 00:39:30
which is itself mutated and probably 30 or 40% of human cancers.

456
00:39:30 --> 00:39:36
And the pathway that regulates this gene, this pathway,

457
00:39:36 --> 00:39:43
is mutated in probably 95% of human cancers very, very commonly affected.

458
00:39:43 --> 00:39:49
OK, so given what I've told you so far, would you expect the mutations

459
00:39:49 --> 00:39:56
that we find in the RB gene in human cancer to be activating mutations or

460
00:39:56 --> 00:40:01
inactivating mutations? Inactivating. It's the brakes.

461
00:40:01 --> 00:40:04
Cancer cells want to get rid of the brakes.

462
00:40:04 --> 00:40:15
 And so we find inactivating

463
00:40:15 --> 00:40:23
mutations in the RB gene in human cancers like deletions or nonsense

464
00:40:23 --> 00:40:31
mutations, that is, stop codon mutations.

465
00:40:31 --> 00:40:35
OK, that's the kind of mutations we find in this gene.

466
00:40:35 --> 00:40:40
For the oncogenes, which we focused on at the beginning,

467
00:40:40 --> 00:40:45
are the mutations in oncogenes dominant or recessive?

468
00:40:45 --> 00:40:49
Are the mutations in the oncogenes dominant or recessive?

469
00:40:49 --> 00:40:54
The oncogene mutations are dominant. When you acquire mutation in an

470
00:40:54 --> 00:40:59
oncogene, whether it's a subtle mutation or an amplification,

471
00:40:59 --> 00:41:04
it doesn't matter what's happening to the other allele.

472
00:41:04 --> 00:41:08
This thing has new function, gain of function. It will transform

473
00:41:08 --> 00:41:12
or start the process of transformation,

474
00:41:12 --> 00:41:16
regardless of what is happening to the other allele.

475
00:41:16 --> 00:41:21
And that's evident, by the way, in this transfection

476
00:41:21 --> 00:41:25
experiment. This would only work if it were a dominant mutation.

477
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
So, oncogene mutations are dominant mutations. Are tumor suppressor

478
00:41:29 --> 00:41:34
gene mutations dominant or recessive? These are recessive mutations.

479
00:41:34 --> 00:41:38
Here, it matters, the state of the other allele of the

480
00:41:38 --> 00:41:43
RB gene. As long as you have one functional copy of the brakes,

481
00:41:43 --> 00:41:48
you can do this. You can control cell cycle regulation.

482
00:41:48 --> 00:41:52
In order to make this dysregulated, you need to get rid of both copies.

483
00:41:52 --> 00:41:57
You need to get rid of the brakes entirely. So, these mutations

484
00:41:57 --> 00:42:02
are recessive. And this class of mutations are

485
00:42:02 --> 00:42:08
recessive. Tumor suppressor gene mutations are recessive.

486
00:42:08 --> 00:42:14
So this raises an interesting question. Tumor suppressor gene

487
00:42:14 --> 00:42:19
mutations are recessive. I've told you that tumor suppressor

488
00:42:19 --> 00:42:25
gene mutations occur commonly in human cancer, not just this RB gene

489
00:42:25 --> 00:42:31
but others too, and yet you are all diploid.

490
00:42:31 --> 00:42:36
You all carry two copies of the tumor suppressor genes.

491
00:42:36 --> 00:42:41
So, how do we ever find mutations in these genes in human cancer?

492
00:42:41 --> 00:42:46
Is it enough to mutate just one copy? No, because they are

493
00:42:46 --> 00:42:52
recessive mutations. So, to find mutations in tumor

494
00:42:52 --> 00:42:57
suppressor genes in human cancer, it's not enough to mutate just one

495
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03
copy. Both copies need to be mutated.

496
00:43:03 --> 00:43:13
 Recessive mutations require there be

497
00:43:13 --> 00:43:18
two mutations. And this is what typically happens

498
00:43:18 --> 00:43:23
in the development of a tumor with a mutation in the RB gene,

499
00:43:23 --> 00:43:27
or any other tumor suppressor gene. Again, there are probably 20 to 50

500
00:43:27 --> 00:43:32
different tumor suppressor genes. Initially, a cell, which has a

501
00:43:32 --> 00:43:37
normal copy of RB on both copies of chromosome 13,

502
00:43:37 --> 00:43:42
that's where this gene sits, and here we are looking at a linked

503
00:43:42 --> 00:43:47
polymorphic marker, big A little a, if you remember

504
00:43:47 --> 00:43:52
polymorphic markers, big A little A.

505
00:43:52 --> 00:44:00
First, one copy of RB gets mutated. In this cell, there is still a

506
00:44:00 --> 00:44:06
normal copy of RB. And therefore,

507
00:44:06 --> 00:44:10
this cell that has acquired this mutation is normal.

508
00:44:10 --> 00:44:14
It's functionally normal. However, it now has just one copy

509
00:44:14 --> 00:44:18
of the RB gene. And so, it's predisposed to

510
00:44:18 --> 00:44:22
becoming a cancer cell if that normal copy gets lost.

511
00:44:22 --> 00:44:26
And what this shows you are various mechanisms by which the

512
00:44:26 --> 00:44:31
normal copy of the RB gene can be lost.

513
00:44:31 --> 00:44:36
The other copy can acquire its own mutation. Or,

514
00:44:36 --> 00:44:42
the chromosome that carries the normal copy of the RB gene can get

515
00:44:42 --> 00:44:47
lost in the developing cancer cell. Or, it can be a recombination of

516
00:44:47 --> 00:44:53
that, that replaces the normal copy of the gene with the abnormal copy

517
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
of the gene. And all three of these things happen in the development of

518
00:44:59 --> 00:45:05
cancer cells. And depending on which mechanism is used --

519
00:45:05 --> 00:45:22
 -- one can observe something

520
00:45:22 --> 00:45:30
referred to as loss --

521
00:45:30 --> 00:45:34
-- of heterozygosity, loss of heterozygosity within the

522
00:45:34 --> 00:45:39
cancer cell. You will notice that this cancer cell,

523
00:45:39 --> 00:45:44
sorry, this normal cell, is heterozygous for this A allele,

524
00:45:44 --> 00:45:48
big A little A. And you will notice that here and here,

525
00:45:48 --> 00:45:53
the cell has become, the cell carries only one version of that A

526
00:45:53 --> 00:45:58
allele, big A. So, there was heterozygosity.

527
00:45:58 --> 00:46:03
And in the cancer cell, there's now loss of heterozygosity.

528
00:46:03 --> 00:46:09
Loss of heterozygosity is a hallmark for tumor suppressor genes,

529
00:46:09 --> 00:46:16
the involvement of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer.

530
00:46:16 --> 00:46:22
OK, now I told you several times that proliferation is important and

531
00:46:22 --> 00:46:33
cell death is important, too.

532
00:46:33 --> 00:46:38
Cell death control in cancer: I don't have a lot of time to tell you

533
00:46:38 --> 00:46:43
more about this in this class, but I want to just emphasize that

534
00:46:43 --> 00:46:48
the pathways that lead from cell death signals,

535
00:46:48 --> 00:46:53
the signals that tell cells to commit suicide to ultimately undergo

536
00:46:53 --> 00:46:59
this process called apoptosis are also dysregulated in cancer.

537
00:46:59 --> 00:47:07
 For example, there's a gene called

538
00:47:07 --> 00:47:13
BCL2, which becomes mutated in certain types of cancer.

539
00:47:13 --> 00:47:20
BCL2 normally blocks this process of cell death.

540
00:47:20 --> 00:47:26
And in this type of cancer, it becomes hyperactive. So there's

541
00:47:26 --> 00:47:33
not as much cell death. BCL2 is an oncogene.

542
00:47:33 --> 00:47:41
Another gene, very important gene in human cancer is P53.

543
00:47:41 --> 00:47:49
It stimulates cell death. P53 gets lost in a high percentage

544
00:47:49 --> 00:47:57
of cancers. It's a tumor suppressor gene, and therefore gets

545
00:47:57 --> 00:48:03
inactivated. BCL2 is an oncogene.

546
00:48:03 --> 00:48:08
It gets hyperactivated in cancers. I'll talk more about this pathway

547
00:48:08 --> 00:48:14
next time, but just to put in your minds, P53 is a very important

548
00:48:14 --> 00:48:19
signaling protein responsive to many signals upstream,

549
00:48:19 --> 00:48:24
giving rise to signals that lead to death as well as arrest.

550
00:48:24 --> 00:48:30
Hang on, please. Hang on. Two minutes left.

551
00:48:30 --> 00:48:34
And this slide is just a summary of what we've been talking about so far.

552
00:48:34 --> 00:48:38
Control of proliferation, control of cell death, the normal

553
00:48:38 --> 00:48:42
balance, perturbations in these pathways, oncogene mutations that

554
00:48:42 --> 00:48:46
stimulate proliferation, tumor suppressor gene mutations that

555
00:48:46 --> 00:48:50
stimulate proliferation. Alterations in apoptosis,

556
00:48:50 --> 00:48:54
oncogene mutations that block apoptosis, tumor suppressor gene

557
00:48:54 --> 00:48:58
mutations that block apoptosis. All of these are important in

558
00:48:58 --> 00:49:03
cancer. Next time I'm going to tell you that

559
00:49:03 --> 00:49:07
some cancers are caused by inherited mutations. And this is a pedigree

560
00:49:07 --> 00:49:12
of such an example, and lastly to remind you,

561
00:49:12 --> 00:49:16
mutations affect proliferation in cell death. But they also affect

562
00:49:16 --> 00:49:21
many other things: invasion, angiogenesis, as well as metastasis.

563
00:49:21 --> 49:24
And I'll stop there.
