4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
particular, we have a class quiz up there. Take a moment if you

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:23
haven't. You've heard a lot of these terms before. One you

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
haven't. I have a particularly wonderful item to make

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:33
up for the tough exam. It is a flashing,

8
00:00:33 --> 00:00:39
isn't that so cool? It's a flashing jellyfish ball. OK,

9
00:00:39 --> 00:00:45
so let's see what we can do. Yes, I know, this is a post-test item. OK,

10
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
settle down. Please, we have a lot to cover. You've

11
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
heard most of these terms before. This lecture is all about these

12
00:00:57 --> 00:01:05
terms phrased in a different way. So I want to make sure we are

13
00:01:05 --> 00:01:16
together before we start. [Student speaks] Yes, ma'am? OK, so the final function of

14
00:01:16 --> 00:01:27
a cell, OK. Potency in the pink top. I saw your hand first,

15
00:01:27 --> 00:01:36
yeah? Yeah, OK, potency. This is a very big one in stem cells,

16
00:01:36 --> 00:01:43
the number of possible fates that a cell can assume,

17
00:01:43 --> 00:01:50
commitment, decision to make a cell type, differentiation,

18
00:01:50 --> 00:01:57
someone on the side of the room must have some thoughts. Yeah?

19
00:01:57 --> 00:02:05
OK, I'll give that to you, to the final transition here.

20
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
Do you want one that's orange rather than pink? God knows I don't want

21
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
to be genderist here, but there we go. The

22
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
differentiation, the process by which a cell assumes

23
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
its final fate. And what we are going to discuss today

24
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
is the kind of gradations of commitments in differentiation,

25
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
commitment particularly, some of the steps of commitment.

26
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
The last one we have not discussed in class, but if anyone wants to

27
00:02:35 --> 00:02:41
have a go, I will, yeah? Lineage, the term lineage in

28
00:02:41 --> 00:02:49
biology.

29
00:02:49 --> 00:02:55
Ish, ish. Let's try another one. Good, OK, a group of cells or a

30
00:02:55 --> 00:03:01
group of cell types that descends from a common precursor,

31
00:03:01 --> 00:03:07
so, this is a funny term, lineage, because it's used a lot in

32
00:03:07 --> 00:03:13
stem cell biology. Let's think about it for a moment. The

33
00:03:13 --> 00:03:19
definition I have is the set of cell types that normally arise from a

34
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
precursor cell. Now, of course, if you think hard,

35
00:03:25 --> 00:03:31
all cells arise from a fertilized egg from a zygote. So,

36
00:03:31 --> 00:03:38
really, all cell types are of a common lineage.

37
00:03:38 --> 00:03:43
And this gets to the question of semantics, and where you put your

38
00:03:43 --> 00:03:48
definition boxes. OK, in stem cell biology, and a lot of

39
00:03:48 --> 00:03:54
biology, the term lineage refers to a subset of cells arising from a

40
00:03:54 --> 00:03:59
common precursor that is somewhat arbitrarily defined. All right,

41
00:03:59 --> 00:04:05
so this diagram which you've seen over several lectures

42
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
is really important. That's just what we've been talking

43
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
about, the progression from uncommitted cells through committed

44
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
cells through differentiated cells. And so, we are in the how-to two

45
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
module, talking about stem cells. Stem cells are in the news all the

46
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
time, and I want to, today, take you beyond the

47
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
newspapers, beyond the magazines, and tell you what I think stem cells

48
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
are all about. So, if you look at our game board of

49
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
life, we are, I would say, halfway plus through the semester,

50
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
and we've gone through all of these things, sticking out here into stem

51
00:04:46 --> 00:04:52
cells. So, where are we? OK, so what's a stem cell?

52
00:04:52 --> 00:04:57
Let me go back for one moment, and let's talk about stem cells.

53
00:04:57 --> 00:05:03
For those of you who don't have a handout, you really should get it.

54
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
It's two pages up front here. So, let's do some board stuff,

55
00:05:09 --> 00:05:15
stem cell, which I will heretofore abbreviate SC is a cell type that I

56
00:05:15 --> 00:05:21
am going to refer to as somewhat committed. So that's deliberately

57
00:05:21 --> 00:05:27
vague. This is not a committed cell type, but it's somewhat committed.

58
00:05:27 --> 00:05:34
It knows more or less what it's going to become.

59
00:05:34 --> 00:05:41
It can be either unipotent or pluripotent or totipotent. And that

60
00:05:41 --> 00:05:48
stem cell, by definition, will go on and make an asymmetric

61
00:05:48 --> 00:05:55
cell division. So, it will give rise to itself,

62
00:05:55 --> 00:06:03
another, not itself, but another stem cell.

63
00:06:03 --> 00:06:09
And it will also give rise to a committed, and here's jargon you

64
00:06:09 --> 00:06:16
should know, progenitor. And so, this is an asymmetric with one S,

65
00:06:16 --> 00:06:23
asymmetric cell division. So, you'll end up with two daughters

66
00:06:23 --> 00:06:30
that are different from one another, a committed cell, and a stem cell.

67
00:06:30 --> 00:06:37
And so, the stem cell in a sense is self renewing,

68
00:06:37 --> 00:06:45
or is self renewing. And then, this is one of the big deals about

69
00:06:45 --> 00:06:53
stem cells. That committed progenitor will go on to divide,

70
00:06:53 --> 00:07:01
and it eventually gives rise to one or more differentiated cell types.

71
00:07:01 --> 00:07:07
OK, in those differentiated cells will come from a specific lineage.

72
00:07:07 --> 00:07:17
 So, the stem cell is

73
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
undifferentiated. The committed progenitor is undifferentiated,

74
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
and eventually you'll end up with a differentiated cell. You can look

75
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
at your first handout. Here it is; I've drawn it for you out. You need

76
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
to know this, so I've done it in two places. There is the asymmetric

77
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
division stem cell plus progenitor, and the progenitor goes on to give

78
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
these differentiated cell types. There is no magic about this. This

79
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
is the same process we've been talking about all along except for

80
00:07:45 --> 00:07:50
the fact of the self renewing thing. So, in the normal embryo,

81
00:07:50 --> 00:07:55
cells go on down the pathway of commitment towards differentiation.

82
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
But they generally do not renew themselves.

83
00:08:00 --> 00:08:05
So, a zygote, for example, although it's totipotent is not

84
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
considered a stem cell because it doesn't self renew. And that's true

85
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
of most embryonic cells. They do not self renew and so they are not

86
00:08:16 --> 00:08:22
considered stem cells. So, what's the deal with stem cells,

87
00:08:22 --> 00:08:28
and why, when I Googled stem cells in Google News last night did I come

88
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
up with several thousand entries for the previous week?

89
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
This is the deal. One of the great goals of biologists is to repair

90
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
organs, to repair damaged tissues. And this has been very difficult to

91
00:08:43 --> 00:08:48
do. We touched on this a few lectures ago.,

92
00:08:48 --> 00:08:53
stem cells have some kind of promise a some kind of universal repair kit.

93
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
And the idea is this, that one could isolate some kind of

94
00:08:57 --> 00:09:02
magic stem cell, or some kind of stem cell,

95
00:09:02 --> 00:09:07
and it would be autologous, which means it would be matching

96
00:09:07 --> 00:09:14
your own cells. OK, so you isolate some kind of

97
00:09:14 --> 00:09:22
autologous, self matching stem cell. That stem cell under ideal

98
00:09:22 --> 00:09:30
conditions is pluripotent, or that set of stem cells, and can

99
00:09:30 --> 00:09:38
be coaxed to form many different cell types depending

100
00:09:38 --> 00:09:45
on how you treat it. So, you can imagine adding some kind

101
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
of factor. And if you like, you can call that an

102
00:09:51 --> 00:09:56
inducer as we have been talking about secreted factors

103
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
in developmental biology. And that inducer would turn those stem

104
00:10:02 --> 00:10:07
cells into progenitors. And those progenitors would

105
00:10:07 --> 00:10:15
have a specific --

106
00:10:15 --> 00:10:20
-- future fate by virtue of which factor you treated the stem cells

107
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
with. You would then take those progenitors, inject them into

108
00:10:26 --> 00:10:37
someone whose body needed repair --

109
00:10:37 --> 00:10:42
And the notion is that these progenitors would go on to

110
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
differentiate and repair whatever needed repairing.

111
00:10:48 --> 00:10:59
 OK, so this is the dream. And

112
00:10:59 --> 00:11:03
this is why you can find headlines like this everywhere. These are

113
00:11:03 --> 00:11:07
some of the ones I pulled out last night: Stem Cells May Help Repair

114
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
Stroke Damage. Stem Cells May Repair Broken Bones. Note the use

115
00:11:11 --> 00:11:15
of the term may. OK, there's a lot of hype about stem

116
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
cells and not much that's been proven. There's a lot of money

117
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
involved in stem cells, trying to isolate stem cells to

118
00:11:23 --> 00:11:27
repair people, and there is also,

119
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
there are also advertisements where you pay people to take your stem

120
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
cells, and to store them. So, poured blood refers to the blood

121
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
of the umbilical cord of a newborn, which is believed to be, it was

122
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
known to be full of stem cells of a certain kinds. And

123
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
you can pay someone a couple of thousand dollars to freeze that

124
00:11:50 --> 00:11:55
group of cells and keep it in case the child needs some kind of stem

125
00:11:55 --> 00:12:00
cell therapy in the future. So, what's the deal? Do stem cells

126
00:12:00 --> 00:12:07
actually exist?

127
00:12:07 --> 00:12:20
Well, yes, OK.

128
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Do stem cells exist or are they just hype? They do exist,

129
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
and the idea is that sometime in embryogenesis,

130
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
as cells are normally going on and making the different cell types,

131
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
some cells are put aside, that the body is going to use later on for

132
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
repairing itself. And there are some examples,

133
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
and I will tell you a couple which are really fantastic illustrations

134
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
of this. So, do stem cells exist?

135
00:12:47 --> 00:12:55
Yes. Where? Likely in the older embryo, and the adult,

136
00:12:55 --> 00:13:03
and the particular organs that contains stem cells is not clear.

137
00:13:03 --> 00:13:11
There are several very good examples, but it's not clear whether or not

138
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
some, yes, all, not clear. It's not clear whether all organs

139
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
contain stem cells. So, let's look at this a bit more,

140
00:13:22 --> 00:13:27
and let's go back to talking about how stem cells were discovered. Why

141
00:13:27 --> 00:13:36
are we having this conversation?

142
00:13:36 --> 00:13:41
And I'm going to be referring to number two on your handout. So,

143
00:13:41 --> 00:13:46
let's talk about the discovery of stem cells. The discovery of stem

144
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52
cells was an accident, and it came about when people

145
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
started looking to see how long cells lived in a particular organ.

146
00:13:57 --> 00:14:03
And the way you do this is by using a protocol called a pulse

147
00:14:03 --> 00:14:10
chase experiment.

148
00:14:10 --> 00:14:20
And a pulse chase experiment gets to the question of turnover rate,

149
00:14:20 --> 00:14:31
or if you want, half-life of cells in an organ.

150
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
OK, this is the way it goes. You've got this as number two on your

151
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
handouts. You take a cell population, or you just take the

152
00:14:39 --> 00:14:44
whole organism if you like, you feed it something called

153
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
bromodeoxyuridine. It doesn't have to be this, but this is a good one.

154
00:14:48 --> 00:14:53
Bromodeoxyuridine is a nucleotide. Deoxyuridine, so,

155
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
you know uracil is normally an RNA, but if you make the deoxy form,

156
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
it gets incorporated into DNA. The bromo part allows it,

157
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
later on, to be detected by various colorimetric assays,

158
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
and you can add BRDU to an organism for a short time. This is called a

159
00:15:10 --> 00:15:15
pulse. The BRDU is incorporated into DNA of those cells that are

160
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
undergoing DNA synthesis, and then by various means you wash

161
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
out the BRDU. And what you get is the labeled cell

162
00:15:23 --> 00:15:28
population that had undergone DNA replication during this pulse

163
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
period. And then, if you follow this group of cells

164
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
over a period of hours or days or weeks or months or years,

165
00:15:36 --> 00:15:41
you can look and see what happens to those labeled cells.

166
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
So, in my example, I started off with for labeled cells

167
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
over some period of time, the number of labeled cells per

168
00:15:49 --> 00:15:54
total unit number of other cells decreases by half. And that gives

169
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
you the half-life of the population. And if you do this for many organs,

170
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
you find that adult organs do not just sit there with a cohort of

171
00:16:02 --> 00:16:08
cells that doesn't divide. There is an enormous amount of cell

172
00:16:08 --> 00:16:14
division in adult organs. And we talked briefly about this

173
00:16:14 --> 00:16:21
previously. So, for example, red blood cells have a

174
00:16:21 --> 00:16:28
half-life of about 120 days. And that actually means that there are

175
00:16:28 --> 00:16:35
more than ten to the 7th new cells produced per day.

176
00:16:35 --> 00:16:40
The intestine is something we touched on previously. Cells in the

177
00:16:40 --> 00:16:45
intestine, some of the cells in the intestine had a half-life of three

178
00:16:45 --> 00:16:51
to five days, and you're producing about ten to the tenth new cells per

179
00:16:51 --> 00:16:56
day. Obviously, the number that you're producing per

180
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
day depends on the total size of the population.

181
00:17:02 --> 00:17:11
Skin has a half-life of about 14 days, hair on your head,

182
00:17:11 --> 00:17:20
a half-life of about four years, and your eyebrows and eyelashes,

183
00:17:20 --> 00:17:30
half life of about 30 days. One of the mysterious half-lives are the

184
00:17:30 --> 00:17:37
neural cells, your nerve cells. It was believed for a long time that

185
00:17:37 --> 00:17:41
nerve cells never divided, and once you've got all your nerve

186
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
cells by about age two, you never made any more. In fact,

187
00:17:45 --> 00:17:49
that doesn't seem to be true. And there are certainly populations of

188
00:17:49 --> 00:17:53
neurons that divide. But we don't really know the half-lives for those

189
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
cells. So, this was very interesting data,

190
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
and it said that there had to be some way that the organism was using

191
00:18:01 --> 00:18:05
to replenish these cells that were dying, and to repopulate the organs

192
00:18:05 --> 00:18:10
so that things functioned properly. And in fact, you can go further

193
00:18:10 --> 00:18:14
than this because you can not only count the labeled cells,

194
00:18:14 --> 00:18:18
you can ask what those labeled cells become. So, you can look at your

195
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
labeled cell population and assay the fate of those labeled cells.

196
00:18:22 --> 00:18:26
And if the cells want to differentiate from an initially

197
00:18:26 --> 00:18:30
undifferentiated population, you know that these differentiated

198
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
cells must have been derived from stem cells or from progenitors

199
00:18:34 --> 00:18:39
by definition. OK, so what organs do we know have

200
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
got stem cells? Let's talk a bit about this. The

201
00:18:43 --> 00:18:48
test is a great example, and the spermatogonia,

202
00:18:48 --> 00:18:53
the diploid precursors of the spermatozoa are dividing cells that

203
00:18:53 --> 00:18:57
divide throughout life, and go on to give rise to themselves

204
00:18:57 --> 00:19:02
so they can replenish themselves. And they go on to give to these

205
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
primary spermatocytes, which are the first step in the

206
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
cascade or in the lineage of cells that are going to differentiate as a

207
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
spermatozoa. OK, and you know you can do these. You

208
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
can look very clearly, and mathematically look and see the

209
00:19:18 --> 00:19:22
number of cells, do this pulse chase analysis,

210
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
and know that the spermatigonea must be stem cells. This is a very

211
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
important stem cell lineage. It's the hematopoietic lineage.

212
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
In the bone marrow, there is some kind of pluripotential

213
00:19:34 --> 00:19:39
hematopoietic cell that gives rise to all of myeloid progenitors,

214
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
so all the red blood cells, and the various other cells in the blood

215
00:19:43 --> 00:19:48
stream as well as to all the immune cells. And those come from a

216
00:19:48 --> 00:19:53
single progenitor, a single pluripotent cell. This is

217
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
called the hematopoietic lineage. And we will talk more about

218
00:19:57 --> 00:20:01
that in a moment. This is an example that I mentioned

219
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
to you many lectures ago. Newt limbs, if they are amputated, will

220
00:20:05 --> 00:20:09
regrow. The reason that they regrow is that there seem to be a

221
00:20:09 --> 00:20:13
population of cells in the lab which are called blastema cells,

222
00:20:13 --> 00:20:16
and those are the cells which can go on and to form the entire limb

223
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
again. And that's something obviously we can't do,

224
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
but people are very interested in. That's been a tough system to look

225
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
at. This might be a better system to try and understand the

226
00:20:28 --> 00:20:31
details of regeneration. So, this is a planarian. This is a

227
00:20:31 --> 00:20:35
flatworm. These are little guys. They can grow up to a couple of

228
00:20:35 --> 00:20:39
centimeters, or a few centimeters. They are very pervasive animals in

229
00:20:39 --> 00:20:43
the animal kingdom. And they have this extraordinary property,

230
00:20:43 --> 00:20:47
as many simple animals do, that you can cut them into pieces,

231
00:20:47 --> 00:20:50
and they will regenerate the whole animal. So, you can take out the

232
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
head. And over time, it will regenerate the tail. You

233
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
can take off the middle; it will regenerate a whole animal,

234
00:20:58 --> 00:21:02
and so on. And this bottom picture is a planarian that's stained for

235
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06
BRDU incorporation, or for another marker as well.

236
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
And each of these dots is a cell called a neoblast.

237
00:21:09 --> 00:21:12
The neoblasts are the stem cells of planaria that can regenerate the

238
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
whole animal. And if you look right up front here,

239
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
it's not very distinct, but you will see a region where

240
00:21:18 --> 00:21:21
there are no neoblasts. And that is the one region of the animal

241
00:21:21 --> 00:21:25
that cannot regenerate. So, if you cut off the very tip of the

242
00:21:25 --> 00:21:28
sort of nose equivalent region. It will not regenerate a new animal

243
00:21:28 --> 00:21:32
because there are no neoblasts. And the system is being studied

244
00:21:32 --> 00:21:37
here at MIT by Professor Reddien of the Whitehead Institute,

245
00:21:37 --> 00:21:42
who is a new faculty member, and who some of you might went to Europe

246
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
with sometime. OK, so let's talk about isolating stem

247
00:21:47 --> 00:21:52
cells, and how you do this. If one is going to use stem cells for

248
00:21:52 --> 00:21:58
repair, you've got to be able to isolate these things.

249
00:21:58 --> 00:22:05
And the challenge of isolating stem cells is that they are rare. For

250
00:22:05 --> 00:22:13
example, in the bone marrow, the hematopoietic stem cells,

251
00:22:13 --> 00:22:21
which I'm abbreviating HSC, comprise about 0.01% of the bone marrow.

252
00:22:21 --> 00:22:29
 And I would say it's fair to say

253
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
that no one has really seen a cell and said, oh, this is a stem cell.

254
00:22:33 --> 00:22:37
It's hard to pinpoint exactly what a stem cell really looks like. It's

255
00:22:37 --> 00:22:41
just a cell. But it's got particular properties,

256
00:22:41 --> 00:22:45
and you need the appropriate way to look at the cells and see these

257
00:22:45 --> 00:22:49
properties. One way that's been used to isolate stem cells is

258
00:22:49 --> 00:22:53
something called FACS, or fluorescence activated cell

259
00:22:53 --> 00:22:57
sorting. I'll talk about it in a moment. And there are two ways

260
00:22:57 --> 00:23:01
that FACS is being used to isolate stem cells. One is by getting a

261
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
group of cells called SP cells where the SP stands for side population.

262
00:23:05 --> 00:23:10
We'll talk about that more in a moment. And the other is through

263
00:23:10 --> 00:23:15
the use of cell surface proteins that are characteristic,

264
00:23:15 --> 00:23:20
or enriched in stem cells. And this has been many decades of work

265
00:23:20 --> 00:23:25
by many people to come up with a set of criteria by which one can enrich

266
00:23:25 --> 00:23:30
for stem cells in a particular population.

267
00:23:30 --> 00:23:34
So, here's the way. Actually, before I go through that, let me go

268
00:23:34 --> 00:23:39
through the assays, and then we will go through all the

269
00:23:39 --> 00:23:44
slides together. How do you assay for stem cells?

270
00:23:44 --> 00:23:49
Well, one of the ways you know you have a stem cell is if you have

271
00:23:49 --> 00:23:54
something that can act as a stem cell. And there are two assays

272
00:23:54 --> 00:23:59
that you should be aware of. One of them is a repopulation assay usually

273
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
done by transplant, and very often you remove some

274
00:24:04 --> 00:24:09
endogenous group of cells, and then try to replace that group

275
00:24:09 --> 00:24:15
of cells by using stem cells. So, you remove some set of

276
00:24:15 --> 00:24:27
differentiated cells.

277
00:24:27 --> 00:24:32
And then, you try to replace with transplanted stem cells. And

278
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
the other way you can do this is in some kind of in vitro culture assay

279
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
which I will talk about later on. All right, so with this in mind,

280
00:24:44 --> 00:24:49
let's go through some of the slides. You've all heard of bone marrow

281
00:24:49 --> 00:24:55
transplants, which people who have leukemia and other associated

282
00:24:55 --> 00:25:01
disorders undergo to repair themselves to get rid of the

283
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
leukemia cells to get rid of the cancer.

284
00:25:07 --> 00:25:11
This is how it works in a mouse. And this is a repopulation assay.

285
00:25:11 --> 00:25:15
I'm going to use bone marrow transplants as an example. You take

286
00:25:15 --> 00:25:20
your mouse, or your person if you are undergoing bone marrow

287
00:25:20 --> 00:25:24
transplants. And you irradiate to destroy the bone

288
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
marrow. The reason you do that is to make space for new cells to come

289
00:25:28 --> 00:25:33
in to expand and grow. If you just put your new cells into

290
00:25:33 --> 00:25:37
an animal with an intact bone marrow, they kind of disappear

291
00:25:37 --> 00:25:42
amidst the masses. So, you have to give the cells your

292
00:25:42 --> 00:25:47
assaying a chance. And then, that irradiated mouse would die.

293
00:25:47 --> 00:25:51
That irradiated person would die. But you get them,

294
00:25:51 --> 00:25:56
now, an injection of normal bone marrow. And if things go well,

295
00:25:56 --> 00:26:01
the mouse or the person lives. And there was a Nobel Prize given

296
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05
out some years ago for developing bone marrow transplantation. One of

297
00:26:05 --> 00:26:10
the gold standards in the stem cell field is asking whether or not this

298
00:26:10 --> 00:26:15
rescued mouse has regenerated stem cells because you can imagine that

299
00:26:15 --> 00:26:19
what you're doing in this case is giving cells that are the

300
00:26:19 --> 00:26:24
progenitors. They are one step down from the stem cells. Or they might

301
00:26:24 --> 00:26:29
even be partly differentiated. So, you can imagine that you are

302
00:26:29 --> 00:26:33
restoring this mouse is life by giving cells that are

303
00:26:33 --> 00:26:38
not self-renewing. Excuse me, one of the gold standards

304
00:26:38 --> 00:26:43
in the stem cell field is to take this rescued mouse,

305
00:26:43 --> 00:26:48
isolate more stem cells or more putative stem cells,

306
00:26:48 --> 00:26:53
and take those and then tried to rescue another mouse. And

307
00:26:53 --> 00:26:58
in the hematopoietic system, you can do this over and over again.

308
00:26:58 --> 00:27:03
So, how many stem cells do you need to repopulate a mouse?

309
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
Actually, you need one, and I will tell you how this is

310
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
done. So, the idea of the first thing when you are trying to do

311
00:27:10 --> 00:27:13
assays to figure out how many stem cells you need for rescue. You take

312
00:27:13 --> 00:27:17
your bone marrow; you stain it for some stem cell marker. You have

313
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
this in front of you. OK, this is number nine of the first

314
00:27:21 --> 00:27:24
page of your handout. You stain somehow for a stem cell marker.

315
00:27:24 --> 00:27:28
I'll tell you in a moment how you sought the stained cells through

316
00:27:28 --> 00:27:32
this fluorescence activated cell sorter.

317
00:27:32 --> 00:27:35
And you isolate from it a pure-ish population of stem cells,

318
00:27:35 --> 00:27:39
an enriched population of stem cells. And then,

319
00:27:39 --> 00:27:43
you do a dilution assay where you inject different

320
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
numbers of cells into a recipient irradiated mouse. Now,

321
00:27:46 --> 00:27:50
you don't actually injects one, ten, and 100 cells. You inject one

322
00:27:50 --> 00:27:54
cell, and millions of carrier cells to help those cells along,

323
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
OK? The one cell would just disappear in your syringe. So,

324
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
you've got to give it some companions. But

325
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
the bottom line is you really only need one stem cell to rescue the

326
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
life of that mouse. It can go and repopulate the entire

327
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
hematopoietic system, all the blood cells, all the immune

328
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
cells. What is this fluorescence activated cell sorter?

329
00:28:17 --> 00:28:22
Fantastic machine. It looks like this. Again, you have this in front

330
00:28:22 --> 00:28:26
of you, so look up here. The idea is that you take a reservoir of

331
00:28:26 --> 00:28:30
cells that you have labeled with particular antibodies. And these

332
00:28:30 --> 00:28:35
are living cells. OK, you label them in certain ways,

333
00:28:35 --> 00:28:39
and they can be labeled with fluorescent antibodies or

334
00:28:39 --> 00:28:43
fluorescent dyes. I'll tell you a dye example in a moment. And

335
00:28:43 --> 00:28:47
you put them in a reservoir, and you trip them out so that one drop of

336
00:28:47 --> 00:28:52
liquid contains one cell on average, or zero cells. And you let those

337
00:28:52 --> 00:28:56
cells drip through a laser and a fluorescence detector. The laser

338
00:28:56 --> 00:29:00
activates the cells. They fluoresce, and you set the detector to activate

339
00:29:00 --> 00:29:04
a charging collar at a specific wavelength of

340
00:29:04 --> 00:29:09
fluorescence. And when the charging collar is

341
00:29:09 --> 00:29:14
activated, it will activate some deflecting plates which will give

342
00:29:14 --> 00:29:19
charge to cells of particular colors, and move them into particular tubes

343
00:29:19 --> 00:29:24
so that they are sorted on the basis of their color. OK,

344
00:29:24 --> 00:29:29
this is done one cell at a time but it's really quick. And

345
00:29:29 --> 00:29:34
you can purify millions of cells to do these kinds of assays.

346
00:29:34 --> 00:29:37
This kind of thing is not done for human bone marrow transplants.

347
00:29:37 --> 00:29:40
There, you take a much bigger population of cells from the bone

348
00:29:40 --> 00:29:44
marrow, and you generally don't purify them very much. But

349
00:29:44 --> 00:29:47
if you want to do specific stem cell assays, and many others,

350
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
the fax machine is really fantastic. So, what do you get out of this?

351
00:29:51 --> 00:29:54
Well, you can plot what the cells look like. So,

352
00:29:54 --> 00:29:58
here in this example, I've got cells that are labeled in

353
00:29:58 --> 00:30:01
red and green. And you can label them according to this

354
00:30:01 --> 00:30:05
plot as to whether they have no label, red label,

355
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
green label, or both red and green. This is a real example of an

356
00:30:09 --> 00:30:14
experiment that was done here at MIT a decade ago in Richard Mulligan's

357
00:30:14 --> 00:30:19
lab. And this is what a real FACS plot looks like. OK,

358
00:30:19 --> 00:30:24
it's a mess. Every little is a cell. But for reasons known only to

359
00:30:24 --> 00:30:29
the Mulligan lab, Peggy Goodell who is now a

360
00:30:29 --> 00:30:34
professor in her own laboratory, they assayed this little region of

361
00:30:34 --> 00:30:39
cells in the bottom left-hand corner for their stem cell properties.

362
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
They called these SP cells or side population cells,

363
00:30:43 --> 00:30:47
and they found to their surprise that these SP cells were highly

364
00:30:47 --> 00:30:51
enriched for hematopoietic stem cells 1,000 fold or more. And

365
00:30:51 --> 00:30:56
in fact, if you take the very bottom left-hand corner where there are

366
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
almost no cells, you get a 10,000 fold enrichment.

367
00:31:00 --> 00:31:05
So, the way they sorted these was with a dye called Hest 3342.

368
00:31:05 --> 00:31:09
This is a vital dye. It stains the DNA but it doesn't tell the cells.

369
00:31:09 --> 00:31:13
And somehow, these SP exclude the dye, or efflux it,

370
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
remove it from the cell. And it's really not clear what that has

371
00:31:17 --> 00:31:21
to do with stem cellness, but this is still one of the very

372
00:31:21 --> 00:31:25
best ways to isolate stem cells from almost every organ. These SP cells,

373
00:31:25 --> 00:31:29
these things that don't stain with these DNA dyes seem to be the ones

374
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
that are stem cell-like. OK, so let's move on to the question

375
00:31:35 --> 00:31:41
to several questions that I want to discuss with you that fall under the

376
00:31:41 --> 00:31:47
umbrella of regulation and control of stem cell fate. And

377
00:31:47 --> 00:31:54
there's several questions I like to pose to you. Firstly,

378
00:31:54 --> 00:32:00
what makes a stem cell self renewing? What's the molecular basis for that?

379
00:32:00 --> 00:32:06
What makes a stem cell decide whether it's going to make

380
00:32:06 --> 00:32:15
progenitors or not?

381
00:32:15 --> 00:32:20
And the big one for the stem cell field, what controls the potency of

382
00:32:20 --> 00:32:25
a stem cell? Well, this is where we step back into the

383
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
developmental biology that we've been talking about because it all

384
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
controls at some level by gene expression.

385
00:32:36 --> 00:32:40
And in particular, there are both intrinsic and

386
00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
extrinsic factors that seem to control certainly the first two

387
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
points on my list, the self renewing and the progenitor

388
00:32:49 --> 00:32:54
aspect, and perhaps also the potency also.

389
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
Intrinsic factors, cell autonomous factors,

390
00:32:58 --> 00:33:05
determinants --

391
00:33:05 --> 00:33:11
-- and extrinsic factors, non autonomous factors, secreted

392
00:33:11 --> 00:33:18
ligands, inducers, and these and extrinsic factors have

393
00:33:18 --> 00:33:25
been given a special name in the stem cell field just for argument's

394
00:33:25 --> 00:33:32
sake. They are called the niche where the niche contains all the

395
00:33:32 --> 00:33:39
cells that influence stem cell activity, cells that influence

396
00:33:39 --> 00:33:45
stem cell activity. OK, this is just a term. You should

397
00:33:45 --> 00:33:49
know it because if you read it you will know it. So,

398
00:33:49 --> 00:33:53
here's how it works. The surrounding cells in the niche are

399
00:33:53 --> 00:33:57
cells that seem to maintain stem cells usually in acquiescent state.

400
00:33:57 --> 00:34:01
So, it's believed that in most organs, stem cells are

401
00:34:01 --> 00:34:05
sitting there quietly. They're not dividing very much,

402
00:34:05 --> 00:34:10
but they can be stimulated to divide, and this is on the second page of

403
00:34:10 --> 00:34:15
your handout. They can be stimulated to divide by some kind of

404
00:34:15 --> 00:34:19
environmental input, and this changes the surrounding

405
00:34:19 --> 00:34:24
cells. And the environmental input could also be a secreted ligand for

406
00:34:24 --> 00:34:29
example. And the surrounding cells then induce

407
00:34:29 --> 00:34:34
the stem cells to be activated. And they go on to make progenitors,

408
00:34:34 --> 00:34:38
and of course also to self renew. This is a fancy way of saying that

409
00:34:38 --> 00:34:42
cell fate is controlled by induction. OK,

410
00:34:42 --> 00:34:46
so you should be nodding. The should not be anything new for you

411
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
at this point. It's phrased a little differently,

412
00:34:50 --> 00:34:54
but that's all. This is a very interesting example of control of

413
00:34:54 --> 00:34:58
cell fate by surrounding cells. This is from my colleague,

414
00:34:58 --> 00:35:02
Professor Fuchs at Rockefeller who studies the hair follicle,

415
00:35:02 --> 00:35:06
and who has shown that this region called the bulge is the

416
00:35:06 --> 00:35:10
source of stem cells. So, this brown thing is the hair

417
00:35:10 --> 00:35:14
that sits in a shaft of cells that got a bunch of interesting cells

418
00:35:14 --> 00:35:18
around it. In particular, there's a rather inconspicuous group

419
00:35:18 --> 00:35:22
of cells on one side called the bulge. And some years ago,

420
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
there is another group of cells. I'm also going to refer to two at

421
00:35:26 --> 00:35:30
the bottom, which is called the dermal propeller.

422
00:35:30 --> 00:35:33
But some years ago, Professor Fuchs took the cells of

423
00:35:33 --> 00:35:37
the bulge and she transplanted them into a mouse that didn't have any

424
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
hair. It's called a nude mouse. It has lots of problems including no

425
00:35:41 --> 00:35:45
hair. But when she did that, here's the control and here's a

426
00:35:45 --> 00:35:48
mouse into which these stem cells have been transplanted. And

427
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
you can see all of a sudden this poor little nude mouse has got tufts

428
00:35:52 --> 00:35:56
of hair. OK, and in fact, these hairs actually

429
00:35:56 --> 00:36:00
glow-in-the-dark. They've been labeled with green. It's

430
00:36:00 --> 00:36:03
really cool, OK? The cells that were transplanted,

431
00:36:03 --> 00:36:07
this is something you know, as well. They were lineage labeled,

432
00:36:07 --> 00:36:11
and so, you could prove that these hairs came from the transplanted

433
00:36:11 --> 00:36:15
cells. All right, so let's look. So,

434
00:36:15 --> 00:36:18
during the hair cycle, so you're hairs grow cyclically.

435
00:36:18 --> 00:36:22
And there are a whole bunch of processes including growth,

436
00:36:22 --> 00:36:26
regression, induction of growth, and new growth. And during that

437
00:36:26 --> 00:36:30
period of time, the bulge and the dermal papillae

438
00:36:30 --> 00:36:34
are in relatively different positions.

439
00:36:34 --> 00:36:38
So, during a process of growth, they are far away from each other,

440
00:36:38 --> 00:36:43
and then as the hair and growth regresses, they come closer until

441
00:36:43 --> 00:36:47
they're actually touching each other during the process of induction of

442
00:36:47 --> 00:36:52
new growth. And it's at that time that new growth in

443
00:36:52 --> 00:36:56
the hair is stimulated. And it's clear that the dermal papillae

444
00:36:56 --> 00:37:01
is signaling to the bulge cells. And here's what it's using to

445
00:37:01 --> 00:37:05
signal. It's using something called the wind pathway,

446
00:37:05 --> 00:37:09
and in particular, a molecule called beta-catenin. If

447
00:37:09 --> 00:37:13
you think back several lectures, we talked about beta-catenin is one

448
00:37:13 --> 00:37:17
of the things that told the embryo to make its back rather than its

449
00:37:17 --> 00:37:21
belly. So, here's a different use of the same molecule in stimulating

450
00:37:21 --> 00:37:25
hairs to grow. And so this is a particularly cool example of cells

451
00:37:25 --> 00:37:29
coming together at particular points to stimulate stem cells to go on and

452
00:37:29 --> 00:37:36
to make progenitors. All right, let's move on to

453
00:37:36 --> 00:37:46
something important called embryonic stem cells And all right --

454
00:37:46 --> 00:37:56
 -- also called ES sells. So,

455
00:37:56 --> 00:38:00
although I told you that most adult organs are likely to have stem cells,

456
00:38:00 --> 00:38:04
and this has been very clearly shown for many, there are many organs

457
00:38:04 --> 00:38:09
where it's not clear whether they have stem cells,

458
00:38:09 --> 00:38:13
or it's very difficult to isolate them. Stem cells are rare in all

459
00:38:13 --> 00:38:17
organs, and things like neural stem cells in the nervous system seemed

460
00:38:17 --> 00:38:22
to be a exceedingly rare and difficult to isolate. So,

461
00:38:22 --> 00:38:26
the push has been to try to find a source of stem cells that would be

462
00:38:26 --> 00:38:31
more plentiful and more useful for repairing lots of different organs.

463
00:38:31 --> 00:38:36
And that's where the embryo comes in this particular kind of stem cell

464
00:38:36 --> 00:38:42
called an embryonic stem cell. And the idea is if one takes an embryo

465
00:38:42 --> 00:38:47
or part of it, puts it into culture,

466
00:38:47 --> 00:38:53
after many steps you get out cells that are called ES cells. And

467
00:38:53 --> 00:38:58
these ES cells are pluripotent. They are not totipotent. But they

468
00:38:58 --> 00:39:04
are very, if I can be forgiven, they are very pluripotent bouquet,

469
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
and they are pluripotent, and you can control their cell fate.

470
00:39:10 --> 00:39:13
So, let me going to the slides, and we will talk more about this

471
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
through the slides. So, in mammalian development,

472
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
and we're going to talk about mammals here specifically,

473
00:39:20 --> 00:39:24
mammalian development, the blastula forms. And at a certain point in

474
00:39:24 --> 00:39:28
development, a group of cells called the inner cell mass segregates from

475
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
the rest of the cells which form a shell around the embryo.

476
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
We mentioned this previously. This yellow stuff is fluid,

477
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40
and this little group of cells called the ICM,

478
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
or inner cell mass, is the thing that's going to give

479
00:39:44 --> 00:39:48
rise to the embryo proper. The cells surrounding are going to give

480
00:39:48 --> 00:39:53
rise to the placenta and the other extra embryonic components. So,

481
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
the idea in trying to get these ES cells is to take the inner cell mass

482
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
of an early embryo, take it out of the embryo,

483
00:40:01 --> 00:40:05
and put it in a Petri dish that's got nutrients and various factors to

484
00:40:05 --> 00:40:09
disperse the cells such that you've got single cells dispersed in the

485
00:40:09 --> 00:40:13
plate, and give them nutrients. And over time,

486
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
those cells will grow, and they will form clumps,

487
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
each of which is derived from a single embryonic cell. OK,

488
00:40:21 --> 00:40:25
now, normal embryonic cells do not do this. OK, they will normally go

489
00:40:25 --> 00:40:29
on and differentiate, and stop dividing, but there's

490
00:40:29 --> 00:40:33
something that happens during this culture process that is abnormal.

491
00:40:33 --> 00:40:37
And it turns the cells into groups of cells that can self renew. OK,

492
00:40:37 --> 00:40:42
so you've turned these cells into self renewing cells. And

493
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
each of these groups of cells or colonies that you get may be able to

494
00:40:46 --> 00:40:51
grow into a stem cell line. And I'll talk about cell lines in a

495
00:40:51 --> 00:40:55
moment. I'll talk about cell lines now. So, you might not be familiar

496
00:40:55 --> 00:41:00
with the term cell line. What is the cell line?

497
00:41:00 --> 00:41:04
A cell line is a cell population, a homogeneous cell population that

498
00:41:04 --> 00:41:08
could grow continuously in culture. So, it's self renewing. OK,

499
00:41:08 --> 00:41:12
so all cell lines are self renewing. A stem cell line is a cell line

500
00:41:12 --> 00:41:17
that has the capacity to go on and differentiate into specific normal

501
00:41:17 --> 00:41:21
cell types. So, there are many cell lines that will

502
00:41:21 --> 00:41:25
grow continuously in culture, but they will never go on and

503
00:41:25 --> 00:41:30
differentiate as anything. They are very abnormal cells.

504
00:41:30 --> 00:41:34
They are useful for many studies, but they are not stem cells. The

505
00:41:34 --> 00:41:38
stem cells not only can grow continuously, but they can go on and

506
00:41:38 --> 00:41:42
differentiate. But you are dealing with an abnormal cells here. This

507
00:41:42 --> 00:41:47
is not a normal embryonic cell. OK, how do you test the potency of these

508
00:41:47 --> 00:41:51
ES cells done in the following way? The ES cells from a mouse, a black

509
00:41:51 --> 00:41:55
mouse, are taken, and they are injected into an early

510
00:41:55 --> 00:42:00
embryo of an embryo derived from white parents.

511
00:42:00 --> 00:42:04
And if you do that, the ES cells incorporate into the

512
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
embryo. You then take the embryos, and put them into a surrogate

513
00:42:08 --> 00:42:12
mother. And when the mice are born, when the babies are born,

514
00:42:12 --> 00:42:16
you can see that they often are not just pure white. They often got

515
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
black stripes, and you can look at the various

516
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24
organs and show that these ES cells have incorporated into various

517
00:42:24 --> 00:42:28
organs. So, these ES cells are highly potent. And

518
00:42:28 --> 00:42:32
the idea is that you can take these ES cells and add to them

519
00:42:32 --> 00:42:37
various factors. So, you can add a particular red

520
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
factor that will turn an ES line into heart muscle cells or pancreas

521
00:42:41 --> 00:42:46
cells or cartilage cells. And you can use those cells in your stem

522
00:42:46 --> 00:42:51
cell repair assays. OK, and this is true. You can take ES

523
00:42:51 --> 00:42:55
cells, and you can do exactly this to them. And then,

524
00:42:55 --> 00:43:00
they will become these different kinds of differentiated derivatives.

525
00:43:00 --> 00:43:05
So, this is really cool. And the push has been to try to get

526
00:43:05 --> 00:43:09
this to work not for mice but for humans. And this is where the huge

527
00:43:09 --> 00:43:13
controversy in the stem cell field comes from. So,

528
00:43:13 --> 00:43:17
the controversy comes from the fact that you need embryos to get these

529
00:43:17 --> 00:43:22
stem cells. You get the embryos from in vitro fertilization that we

530
00:43:22 --> 00:43:26
touched on a few lectures ago. Eggs are isolated by ovarian stimulation.

531
00:43:26 --> 00:43:30
They are fertilized in vitro, and they are allowed to grow in

532
00:43:30 --> 00:43:35
vitro for a week or so. And at that point,

533
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
there are harvested or killed to make the ES line. And

534
00:43:39 --> 00:43:44
this is the very controversial point, whether or not it is ethically OK to

535
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
harvest these embryos, and turn them in to stem cell lines

536
00:43:48 --> 00:43:53
or not. Presently, there is no federal funding that is

537
00:43:53 --> 00:43:58
allowed to be used to make human ES cell lines. There are some that

538
00:43:58 --> 00:44:02
exist, and President Bush has told scientists that they need to use the

539
00:44:02 --> 00:44:07
ones that exist. However, they are not very good cell

540
00:44:07 --> 00:44:12
lines, and so scientists have used private funding to make new human ES

541
00:44:12 --> 00:44:17
lines that hopefully will be more useful. I don't think there's any

542
00:44:17 --> 00:44:22
right or wrong answer whether this is OK or not. My opinion is that

543
00:44:22 --> 00:44:27
this is an OK thing to do, with all due respect to the embryo.

544
00:44:27 --> 00:44:32
I think one can save people's lives, well, and the embryo at this point

545
00:44:32 --> 00:44:37
is not a differentiated entity. But it is an embryo. And so,

546
00:44:37 --> 00:44:41
this is an ethical issue. There's opinion here, and it's good for you

547
00:44:41 --> 00:44:46
to think about what your opinion about this type of research is. OK,

548
00:44:46 --> 00:44:50
so let's move on. And I'm going to, in the last minute,

549
00:44:50 --> 00:44:55
just touch on something called stem cell plasticity.

550
00:44:55 --> 00:45:09
 One of the things that has come out

551
00:45:09 --> 00:45:13
of the human ES work or all the ES work, and that has come out of the

552
00:45:13 --> 00:45:18
quest not to use embryos for stem cells is to ask whether or not one

553
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
can turn one stem cell line into another. So, it's easy,

554
00:45:22 --> 00:45:27
or relatively easy, to get hematopoietic stem cells. And

555
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
wouldn't it be wonderful if you take those hematopoietic stem cells and

556
00:45:32 --> 00:45:36
turn them into brain stem cells, and fix people who have Parkinson's

557
00:45:36 --> 00:45:41
or Alzheimer's? OK, wouldn't it be wonderful to fix

558
00:45:41 --> 00:45:45
people who have muscular dystrophy by turning hematopoietic stem cells

559
00:45:45 --> 00:45:49
that you can get lots of into muscle cells? So, the idea is maybe you

560
00:45:49 --> 00:45:53
could turn something from one lineage, a hematopoietic stem cell

561
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
into a stem cell from another lineage and get it to

562
00:45:57 --> 00:46:01
do something else? And the hypothesis,

563
00:46:01 --> 00:46:05
then, is that if you do appropriate experiments, you may be able to

564
00:46:05 --> 00:46:09
figure out where the stem cells from one lineage can contribute to

565
00:46:09 --> 00:46:13
another. This is the second to last slide on your handout. So,

566
00:46:13 --> 00:46:17
this is the way the experiments were done. It's the last thing I'm going

567
00:46:17 --> 00:46:21
to tell you. Bear with me. You can take a mouse that's been dyed green,

568
00:46:21 --> 00:46:25
and its hematopoietic stem cells are expressing GFP,

569
00:46:25 --> 00:46:29
which is a green fluorescent protein. You use that mouse as a

570
00:46:29 --> 00:46:33
daughter for bone marrow transplants.

571
00:46:33 --> 00:46:37
You put in the great cells. Not only do you rescue the bone marrow,

572
00:46:37 --> 00:46:41
you also ask whether other organs have got green cells in them,

573
00:46:41 --> 00:46:45
indicating that the hematopoietic cells can contribute to other

574
00:46:45 --> 00:46:49
lineages. And when you do that,

575
00:46:49 --> 00:46:53
initially people got very excited because you saw results like this.

576
00:46:53 --> 00:46:57
And this is data from my colleague, Dr. Camargo over at the Whitehead

577
00:46:57 --> 00:47:01
Institute. When this experiment was done, he could show that the liver

578
00:47:01 --> 00:47:05
of such an animal had lots of green cells, suggesting that the

579
00:47:05 --> 00:47:10
hematopoietic stem cells could also be liver stem cells.

But when he looked more closely, this is a complete artifact. And

581
00:47:14 --> 00:47:19
what had happened was that the hematopoietic stem cells had

582
00:47:19 --> 00:47:23
actually fused with the liver cells, making the liver cells green. And

583
00:47:23 --> 00:47:28
in fact, presently, there is no data to suggest that you

584
00:47:28 --> 47:31
can interconvert stem cell lineages. And I'll stop there. Thank you.
