7.013 Spring 2005 Problem Set 4 
FRIDAY April 8th, 2005 

Problem sets will NOT be accepted late. 

Question 1 

a) A friend knows you are taking 7.013 and therefore an expert on cloning, so he asks you 
to clone a cat for him.  He suggests several cell types from which you could take the 
nucleus for the experiment. Match the cell types with your reactions and write a brief 
explanation of why you reacted this way.  Use each letter once. 

A 
early stage embryonic cell 
B 
B cell (see Figs 18. 8 and 18.19.a, p.382-383) 
C 
Sperm 
D  Neuron 
E 
Red Blood Cell 

i)  “Forget it. I could do the transfer but we’d never get a viable clone.” ________C___ 
haploid. 

ii)  “Okay. Not a bad place to start.” ________D_____ 

iii)  “Terrific! That will maximize our chance of success!” _______A______ 

iv)  “Are you kidding? I couldn’t even do the experiment with that.” _____E________ 
No nucleus. 

v)  “Hm…. I can try, but we’ll probably end up with one sick cat.” _______B______ 

Missing Variability of antibody types.


b) What will you transfer the nucleus into? 
enucleated egg

c) What are the two key characteristics of a stem cell? 

1) Self-renewing. 

2) Can differentiate into other cell types. 

d) Which cells in the diagram below are stem cells? __________A, D_______ 

e) Which cell in the diagram above would you most want to use to obtain a nucleus for the 
cloning experiment above?  Explain briefly. A-most pluripotient 

f) What is the difference between embryonic stem cells and stem cells from adults? 
Embryonic stem cells are more pluripotent. 

g) The Massachusetts legislature is currently debating a bill that would make it much 
easier to do somatic cell nuclear transfer and stem cell research in the state. Do you 
personally think such a bill should pass or do you have concerns about it? Explain in three 
or four sentences.

Question 2 

A. To examine the role of cell adhesion in tissue formation, you remove epithelial cells and
neural cells from a Drosophila embryo, dissociate them so that any existing connections 
are gone and each cell is independent.  You then label each type of cell with a different 
color dye and mix the two cell populations together on a plate. 

Epithelial Cells 

Neural Cells 

Petri dish for placing 
mix of cells 

For parts a through c use empty circles to represent epithelial cells and filled circles to 
represent neural cells (like above). 

a) What would the cells look like immediately after mixing them?  Draw what you would 
expect to see in the petri dish below. 

3 

b) What would you expect to see if you looked at the cells at later time points after 
mixing?  Assume for simplicity that mitosis has not occurred.  Draw what you expect to 
see after a short incubation  and then after a longer incubation. in the petri dishes below.

c) EDTA is a calcium chelator that sequesters calcium making it useless. How would your 
results in b) change if you added EDTA to the cells before mixing them? 

i) Draw the expected results in the petri dish below. 

ii) What aspect of cell behavior are we disrupting by the addition of EDTA above and 
what molecules are involved? 

Cell adhesion /Cahedrins 
iii) Design an experiment that would allow identification of the molecules involved in this 
behavior. 

Create mutants that lack adhesion ability. Or create mutants that are resistant to 
EDTA. Construct a a wild-type cDNA library transform into these mutant lines and look 
for cells that regain the wild type ability to adhere (for the adeherent defective 
strain) or look for the susceptibility to EDTA (for the EDTA resistant strain).

B. During your summer research internship in the Amazon, you stumble upon a never before seen
spectacular creature (shown leaping below), which you give it the genus and species name Nihplod 
reggit. 

Figure by MIT OCW.

You decide to study the early development of Nihplod reggit to see how if you can find 
similarities to known organisms.  You discover that the Nihplod reggit has a unique organ that acts 
as a combination heart and lung.  This organ forms from a series of primitive tubes that develop 
from a specific region of the mesoderm. 

a) What type of experiment could you use to determine which cells of the mesoderm give rise to 
this organ? Fate mapping 

b) Describe one of the three possible ways that these tubes can form.  What type of cells are 
involved in each process? 

1) ballooning -Epithelial sheets 

2) cavitation-Epithelial sheets3) condensation-Mesenchymal Cells 

Development of the mature heart lung organ requires elongation and thinning (changing layer 
thickness and number) of the primitive tubes. 

c) What types of cell movements could be leading to these changes?  Are these changes likely 
occurring in sheets of cells or in mesenchyme? 

Changes in layer number through processes such as delamination and radial intercolation. Changes 
in length through intercolation, cobnvergent extension. Most likely occurring in sheets. 

d) These shape changes are triggered by the production of heart growth factor (HGF) in 
neighboring cells.  How could a growth factor induce changes in cell shape and movement? 

Through transcriptional changes and signal transduction resulting in actin polymerization and 
depolymerization. 

e) What role does actin play in cell movement? 

It polymerizes at one end of a cell into projectiles that extend out of the plasma membrane and 
depolymerizes at the opposite end of the cell allowing the cell to move forward. 

f) What effect would addition of a drug that prevented actin polymerization or depolymerization 
have on cell movement? 
Since both polymerization and depolymerization of actin is required for cell movement and shape change, the cells would no longer be 
able to move.

Question 4 

a) What is the normal “resting potential” of a neuron?  How does it manage to stay at this 

potential?

The size of the resting potential in neurons is about -70 millivolts (mv).


The resting potential arises  and is maintained by 2 channels… 

1) The sodium/potassium ATPase pump. This pump pushes exchanges potassium ions (K+) into the cell for sodium ions 
(Na+) it pumps out of the cell. 

2) The leak potassium channels in the plasma membrane are "leaky" allowing a slow facilitated diffusion of K+ out of the 
cell. The movement of ions across the cell membrane depend both on concentration and electrostatic gradients. 

b) Match each letter on the diagram below to the appropriate states of the 
voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels in the axonal membrane. Not every statement 
will have a matching letter.
