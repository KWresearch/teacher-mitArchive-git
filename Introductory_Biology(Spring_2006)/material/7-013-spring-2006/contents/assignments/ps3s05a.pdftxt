iii) Would Bam HI be useful cloning? Why or why not? No. There’s only one Bam site in 
smack inthe middle of YFG. 

iv) Would Xba I be useful for cloning? Why or why not?No. There’s an Xba I site in the 
middle of the Ampicillin resistance gene. 

v) Would Xho I be useful cloning? Why or why not? No. There’s a Xho I site in the Ori 
of pNEW. 

You digest both plasmids with the appropriate restriction enzyme(s) and combine digests 
in a single tube and add DNA Ligase. You transform appropriate bacteria with this ligation 
mix. 
b) How would you identify transformants that have taken up pNew but not pOld-YFG ? 
(Hint: 2 steps) Select transformants on Ampicillin plates. Replica plate colonies onto 
tetracycline medium to screen AmpR colonies for tetracycline sensitivity. 

Now that you have colonies that have taken up pNew, you realize that the YFG gene could have inserted in either 
orientation. You take 10 transformants, isolate plasmid DNA from them, and perform restriction digestion using Bam 
H1. You get the following results after running the digests out on an agarose gel.

Question 2 

You want to study protein targeting in yeast, but first you need to construct a strain that 
will help you with your research. Your goal is to clone the gene encoding the Fructose 
Receptor (FruR), a plasma membrane protein, and fuse it with a gene encoding Green 
Fluorescent Protein (GFP). 

a) You first make a cDNA library from yeast that is able to grow fructose. This is done 
by using the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase (RT) to make a DNA copy of each of the 
messenger RNA molecules in this yeast strain. RT, like other DNA polymerases, needs a 
primer to initiate elongation. You recall from earlier lectures that eukaryotic mRNA has a 
cap at the 5' end and is polyadenylated (An) at the 3' end. 

5’CAP------------------------------------------------------3’polyA tail 

i) Which end of an RNA molecule (5' or 3') would you use as a template to design a primer? 
Circle one. 

3'

ii) Given what you know, as stated above, what would be a good 'universal' primer for an RT

reaction? (Assume 10 nucleotides long is sufficient.)


TTTTTTTTTT 

b) Using the primer you just designed you’ve synthesized millions of cDNA molecules but 
only a few encode the fructose receptor gene. 

i) First you need to clone these cDNAs into vectors.  What needs to be upstream of 
your cDNA in the vector to insure strong expression of the fructose receptor? 
Promoter 

ii) You consider expressing the protein in bacteria. Why would this plan make it critical 
to have made a cDNA library rather than making genomic DNA library? 

Bacteria are unable to splice out the introns that would occur in a genomic sequence from eukaryotic DNA 

iii) You decide to transfrom your library into yeast. How would you isolate the plasmid 
clone expressing the fructose receptor? What yeast strain would you transform into? 

Wild-type Yeast 

Fructose Receptor Mutant Yeast 

iv) What medium could you use to plate the transformants that would select for the 
correct plasmid clone. Minimal Fructose medium (Fructose as the only carbon source.)

c) Now that you have the FruR gene cloned, you want to amplify the gfp gene encoding Green Fluorescent Protein from some jellyfish 
cells. Your first step is to design primers so that you can use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the region.  Below is 
highlighted the sequence at each outside end of gfp.

i) Of the potential primers listed below, which 2 can you use to amplify the DNA of interest?  (Circle the correct 2.) 
A: 
5'-GTAAACGGCCACAAG-3'

F:

G: 
5'-CAGCACGACGAAGTA-3' 

ii) Schematically, using lines as DNA and filled in boxes and open boxes as primers, draw the products of the reaction starting from the double 
stranded piece of DNA below after it has gone through each of 2 rounds of replication. The binding sites of the primers are shown on the template 
below.

iii) Using PCR, you successfully amplified a piece of DNA. To confirm that it is indeed gfp you sequence it. What is the sequence of the 
DNA on the gel below?  (Be sure to label the 5' and 3' ends.)

Question 3 

You are pleased to discover that this is indeed a sequence ofgfp. Your goal is to make a fusion protein where the N-terminus of Green 
Fluorescent Protein is replaced by Fructose Receptor.  Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is a protein isolated from jellyfish that 
fluoresces green when exposed to blue light (It has been demonstrated that some proteins do not require their extreme C terminus or 
their N terminus to function.) 
In this case, the first half of the fusion protein (the NH3 end) will be a fully functional Fru R protein, and the second half (the COOH 
end) will be a fully functional GFP protein.

The sequence for the extreme 3' end of fruR and the 5' start of gfp is shown below.  For both, the underlined indicates an in frame 
codon.  For gfp, it corresponds to the start codon.

Determine what enzyme(s) you would use to fuse the 5’ end of gfpwith the 3’ end of fruR such that the resulting gene fusion would 
result in the expression of an in-frame hybrid protein. Remember it’s ok to fuse the genes in a way that they are missing a bit off the 
ends or even adding some nucleotides between them. The goal is to make an in-frame fusion protein.

The way I do this problem is that I delineate the codons in both nontemplate coding strands. I then look at where the 
restriction sites are and how they line up in the reading frames. To keep the frame intact in the fusion, the matching 
restriction sites have to be exactly like each other. That is if the 6 base site perfectly includes 2 codons then the 
same site must perfectly include 2 codons in the other piece. If the site starts within a codon by 1 nucleotide, then it 
has to join the same site that also starts with a codon by 1 nucleotide. Using this strategy there are only two possible 
answers that line up exactly. –And that is: 
Afl II and Kpn I. However since the Kpn I site in the end of the fruR gene is downstream of the stop codon, using this 
site could never result in a hybrid protein. SO THE ANSWER is Afl II.

Question 4 

After successfully making your in-frame GFP fusion, you are ready to use this construct to 
elucidate new genes involved in protein targeting in the yeast cell. To identify new targeting 
genes, you create a collection of temperature sensitive yeast mutants. Temperature-sensitive 
mutations produce functional protein products at low (permissive) temperatures but do not 
produce functional protein at high (restrictive or nonpermissive) temperatures. This allows a 
rapid switch from a wild type to a mutant phenotype by a temperature shift from permissive to 
restrictive.  Thus temperature sensitive mutations allow one to study genes whose products are 
essential for the strain because one can grow and maintain the strain at the permissive 
temperature. 

To determine if any of your temperature sensitive mutations have an effect on protein targeting 
you introduce your newly constructed gene fusion to each mutant strain to examine the 
localization of FruR-GFP hybrid protein. The GFP tag allows you to visualize that localization of 
FruR in the cell using fluorescence microscopy. 
Below are the observations from the fluorescence microscopy for the wild type yeast strain. Note that all fusion 
proteins are bound to the plasma membrane as seen in picture below. 

Photomicrograph removed due to copyright reasons. 

You identify 5 temperature sensitive mutations that are defective in protein targeted at 
the restrictive temperature and name them dpt1-5. 

dpt1: All ER localized 
dpt2: Found in small vesicles 
dpt3: Found in the cis Golgi 
dpt4: Cytoplasmic 
dpt5:  No GFP detected 

a) For each of the mutants identify which step of the secretory pathway is blocked. 
(Assume all mutations are in proteins other than FruR.)

dpt2 
dpt3 
dpt4 
dpt5 

Step of Secretory Pathway Affected 
ER to Golgi transport vesicle budding 
Block of fusion of transport vesicle to Golgi or Secretory vesicles to PM 
Block of formation of Secretory vesicles 
Block of ribosome binding to ER 
Block of protein synthesis

b) Which of the above mutations could be a result of an internal mutation in FruR?

Explain what the mutation would be.


dpt1: Gain of an ER retention signal


dpt3: loss of signal to enter vesicles


dpt4: loss of signal sequence


dpt5: nonsense mutation
