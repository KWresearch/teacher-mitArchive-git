7.013 Spring 2005 Problem Set 2 Solutions 
FRIDAY February 18, 2004 

Problem sets will NOT be accepted late.

Question 1 

The following family was used to study the transmission of a gene responsible for a rare trait. Since the 
trait is 'rare', assume that people marrying into the family have 2 normal alleles for the gene of interest in 
this case. 

This family was found to carry the rare allele manifesting in the ability to see through walls (“x-Ray 
vision”).  The pedigree for this phenotype follows.

a) What is the most likely mode of inheritance?  (Choose from: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-
linked dominant, X-linked recessive, Y-linked dominant, and Y-linked recessive, or mitochondrial 
inheritance.) 

autosomal recessive 

b) Use “R” and “r” for the x-Ray vision alleles. Use the capital letter for the allele conferring the dominant 
phenotype and include sex chromosomes if appropriate. What is the genotype of individual 2? 

Rr 

c) What is the genotype of individual 3? 

rr 
d) If individual 4 marries individual 5, what is the probability that their child will be heterozygous at the 
locus of interest?  Show your work. 
2/3 chance of being Rr vs RR,  X  1/2 probability of giving allele --> producing heterozygote 

= 1/3

 Amazingly (and conveniently), the same family carries the rare allele for having 6 
fingers. The inheritance pattern follows. The inheritance patterns for both the 6-finger 
phenotype and x-Ray vision are illustrated in the following pedigree.

e) What is the most likely mode of inheritance for the allele causing the 6-finger 
phenotype? (Choose from: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, 
X-linked recessive, Y-linked dominant, and Y-linked recessive, or mitochondrial 
inheritance.) 

Autosomal dominant 

f) If the genes conferring x-Ray vision and having 6 fingers are linked, what alleles of the 
two genes are found on each chromosome of individual #1, IF NO recombination occurs,? 

Use “D” and “d” to describe the alleles of the finger or Digit locus.

Use “R” and “r” to describe the alleles of the x-Ray locus.

Use the capital letter for the allele conveying the dominant phenotype. 

Place the alleles for each locus on the chromosomes shown below.

Indicate whether the chromosomes below are sex chromosomes.

several generations.

Question 3 

In the year 2012, a Mars probe sends a Martian soil sample back to Earth. Your lab is 
chosen to study an organism found alive in this sample! The organism contains DNA that 
uses the same 4 deoxyribonucleotides (dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and dCTP) that earth 
organisms use. You isolate the Martian DNA polymerase so you can study DNA replication 
in this organism. 

You use Martian DNA polymerase, a short DNA primer (5’ ACCCAG 3’) (DNA primers work 
as well as RNA primers) and the 4 deoxyribonucloetides to replicate the following double 
stranded DNA template.

5’–ACTTGATGGGGCATAACGCTACCTGGGTCCGATACAGTTT-3’

a) In what direction does DNA polymerization occur on Earth? 

3’5’ 

CN 

5’3’ 

NC 

b) If the Martian DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA in the 5’ to 3’ direction, write the 
resulting DNA sequences and indicate the polarity (5’ and 3’) and the lengths (in 
nucleotides) of the daughter strand(s) on the figure below. 

5’ –ACTTGATGGGGCATAACGCTACCTGGGTCCGATACAGTTT- 3’

 3’  TCAACTACCCCGTATTGCGATGGACCCA  5’  28bp 

3’ –TGAACTACCCCGTATTGCGATGGACCCAGGCTATGTCAAA- 5’


c) Based on your answer, and the primer provided will you be able to fully replicate the 
Martian DNA boxed above? If no, explain why not. 

No, there is only replication of part of one strand.

c) Meselson and Stahl demonstrated that E. coli replicates in a distinct manner. (See 
textbook, pgs 221-222.) This was shown by first growing E. coli in medium containing 15N 
for the first few generations, shifting the culture to medium containing to lighter 14N 
and then examining the density of the next generation of DNA. Their results are shown 
below.

i) What manner  of replication did they observe? Conservative, Semi-conservative  or 
Dispersive? 

ii) You perform the same kind of experiment with your Martian organism and you get 
the following results. What manner of replication is this?

Question 4 

While working in the lab late one night, you notice something about the mice that live behind the 
freezers: Most of the mice are black, but there are rare cases of white mice. You capture two 
white mice and two black mice, and breed black with black and white with white. You find that all 
of the offspring of the black mice are black, and all of the offspring of the white mice are white. 
You find these strains to be pure or true breeding, that is to say all subsequent generations 
resemble their parents with respect to fur color. 

a) One of the white males gets tired of the local scene and sneaks out of his cage and into a cage 
full of black females. The next morning, you find him sleeping in the corner. After putting him 
back into his own cage, you notice that all 10 of the females in the cage are now pregnant! 
Interestingly, all 100 offspring fathered by the white male are completely black. You think: 
“Hmmmm, this could be explained if white coat color is a recessive trait. I’ll call the dominant 
coat color allele ‘B’ and the recessive allele ‘b’.” List all relevant genotypes and phenotypes of the 
original parents, denoted P and the offspring, denoted F1. 

P: 

BB – Black 

bb - White 

F1:  Bb - Black 

b) In order to test your hypothesis, you take 10 pairs of the offspring (F1) from the 
above cross, and mate them to each other, to produce 100 new offspring (F2). If your 
hypothesis is correct: 

i) What fur colors will you see in the F2 generation? 

Black and white 

ii) What are the corresponding genotypes? 

BB – black 

Bb – black 

bb – white 

iii) Roughly how many mice of each genotype and phenotype do you expect to see of the 
100 F2 progeny? Show your work. 

Ratio from hybrid cross will be 

BB:Bb:bb
 1:2:1 

So, 

25 BB 

50 Bb 

25 bb 

thus, 

75 black 

25 white 

6 

c) Another student in the lab, who happens to be your academic rival, notices that all of 
the white mice from which the male in the P generation came have red eyes, while all of 
the black mice from the P generation have green eyes. Examining the F1 mice, he notices 
that they are all black, AND all have green eyes. He proclaims loudly that he has figured 
it out! The same mutation that causes white fur causes red eyes. Begrudgingly, you admit 
that it is a good idea. 

If he is right, what are the genotypes and phenotypes of the F2 mice with respect to eye 
color and coat color? 

BB – green eyes, black fur 

Bb – green eyes, black fur  bb – red eyes, white fur 

d) Triumphantly, you realize that there is another explanation: There could be 2 separate 
recessive mutations on different chromosomes; one causing white coat color and one 
causing red eyes. You decide to call the allele causing red eyes ‘g’, and the allele causing 
green eyes ‘G’. If your hypothesis is correct: 

i) What classes of genotype will you see in the F2 mice? List their corresponding 
phenotypes. 

BBGG – black coat, green eyes 

BBGg – black coat, green eyes 

BBgg – black coat, red eyes 

BbGG – black coat, green eyes 

BbGg – black coat, green eyes 

Bbgg – black coat, red eyes 

bbGG – white coat, green eyes 

bbGg – white coat, green eyes 

bbgg – white coat, red eyes

ii) Approximately how many mice of the 100 progeny do you expect to see, of each 
phenotype? (A Punnett square may aid your calculation.)

Question 5 (continuation of previous question) 

When the two of you stop bickering and go and check out the 100 F2 mice, you are both 
shocked to find that neither of you predicted the right proportions! What you observe is 
somewhere in between your two guesses. In order to relieve any ambiguity, you decide to 
do a testcross. That is to say that you cross F1 females to the male of the P generation 
(from Question 3). 

From this cross, you get: 

46 mice with black fur and green eyes, 
45 mice with white fur and red eyes, 
4 mice with black fur and red eyes, 
5 mice with white fur and green eyes 

a) Propose a new theory as to what is most likely to be causing these strange proportions. 

Linkage between the two genes 

b) Can you determine how far apart are the eye and fur color genes in cM? 

i) No, not enough information given to determine whether they are linked. 

ii) No, they are not linked.

iii) Yes, my calculation is shown below. (Calculate below.)


Recombinants/total progeny * 100 = map distance in cM 

(4+5)/(4+5+45+46) = 9 cM 

Recombinants/Total progeny
