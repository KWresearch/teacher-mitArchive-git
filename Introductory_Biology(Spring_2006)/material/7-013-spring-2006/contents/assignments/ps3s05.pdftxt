iv) Would Xba I be useful for cloning? Why or why not? 

v) Would Xho I be useful cloning? Why or why not? 

You digest both plasmids with the appropriate restriction enzyme(s) and combine digests 
in a single tube and add DNA Ligase. You transform appropriate bacteria with this ligation 
mix. 
b) How would you identify transformants that have taken up pNew but not pOld-YFG? 
(Hint: 2 steps) 

Now that you have colonies that have taken up pNew, you realize that the YFG gene could have 
inserted in either orientation. You take 10 transformants, isolate plasmid DNA from them, and 
perform restriction digestion using BamH1. You get the following results after running the 
digests out on an agarose gel.

Question 2 

You want to study protein targeting in yeast, but first you need to construct a strain that 
will help you with your research. Your goal is to clone the gene encoding the Fructose 
Receptor (FruR), a plasma membrane protein, and fuse it with a gene encoding Green 
Fluorescent Protein (GFP). 

a) You first make a cDNA library from yeast that is able to grow fructose. This is done 
by using the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase (RT) to make a DNA copy of each of the 
messenger RNA molecules in this yeast strain. RT, like other DNA polymerases, needs a 
primer to initiate elongation. You recall from earlier lectures that eukaryotic mRNA has a 
cap at the 5' end and is polyadenylated (An) at the 3' end. 

5’CAP------------------------------------------------------3’polyA tail 

i) Which end of an RNA molecule (5' or 3') would you use as a template to design a primer?

Circle one.


ii) Given what you know, as stated above, what would be a good 'universal' primer for an RT

reaction? (Assume 10 nucleotides long is sufficient.)


b) Using the primer you just designed you’ve synthesized millions of cDNA molecules but 
only a few encode the fructose receptor gene. 

i) First you need to clone these cDNAs into vectors.  What needs to be upstream of 
your cDNA in the vector to insure strong expression of the fructose receptor? 

ii) You consider expressing the protein in bacteria. Why would this plan make it critical 
to have made a cDNA library rather than making genomic DNA library? 

iii) You decide to transfrom your library into yeast. How would you isolate the plasmid 
clone expressing the fructose receptor? What yeast strain would you transform into? 

Wild-type Yeast 

Fructose Receptor Mutant Yeast 

iv) What medium could you use to plate the transformants that would select for the 
correct plasmid clone.

c) Now that you have the FruR gene cloned, you want to amplify the gfp gene encoding Green Fluorescent 
Protein from some jellyfish cells. Your first step is to design primers so that you can use polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) to amplify the region.  Below is highlighted the sequence at each outside end of gfp.

the reaction starting from the double stranded piece of DNA below after it has gone through each of 2 
rounds of replication. The binding sites of the primers are shown on the template below.

Question 3 

You are pleased to discover that this is indeed a sequence ofgfp. Your goal is to make a 
fusion protein where the N-terminus of Green Fluorescent Protein is replaced by 
Fructose Receptor (FruR).  Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is a protein isolated from 
jellyfish that fluoresces green when exposed to blue light (It has been demonstrated 
that some proteins do not require their extreme C terminus or their N terminus to 
function.) 
In this case, the first half of the fusion protein (the NH3 end) will be a fully functional 
Fru R protein, and the second half (the COOH end) will be a fully functional GFP protein.

Determine what enzyme(s) you would use to fuse the 5’ end of gfp with the 3’ end of fruR 
such that the resulting gene fusion would result in the expression of an in-frame hybrid 
protein. Remember it’s ok to fuse the genes in a way that they are missing a bit off the 
ends or even adding some nucleotides between them. The goal is to make an in-frame 
fusion protein.

Question 4 

After successfully making your in-frame GFP fusion, you are ready to use this construct to 
elucidate new genes involved in protein targeting in the yeast cell. To identify new targeting 
genes, you create a collection of temperature sensitive yeast mutants. Temperature-sensitive 
mutations produce functional protein products at low (permissive) temperatures but do not 
produce functional protein at high (restrictive or nonpermissive) temperatures. This allows a 
rapid switch from a wild type to a mutant phenotype by a temperature shift from permissive to 
restrictive.  Thus temperature sensitive mutations allow one to study genes whose products are 
essential for the strain because one can grow and maintain the strain at the permissive 
temperature. 

To determine if any of your temperature sensitive mutations have an effect on protein targeting 
you introduce your newly constructed gene fusion to each mutant strain to examine the 
localization of FruR-GFP hybrid protein. The GFP tag allows you to visualize that localization of 
FruR in the cell using fluorescence microscopy. 

Below are the observations from the fluorescence microscopy for the wild type yeast strain. 
Note that all fusion proteins are bound to the plasma membrane as seen in picture below. 

Photomicrograph removed due to copyright reasons. 

You  identify  5  temperature  sensitive  mutations  that  are  defective  in  protein  targeting  at  the 
restrictive temperature and name them dpt1-5. 

dpt1: All ER localized 
dpt2: Found in small vesicles 
dpt3: Found in the cis Golgi 
dpt4: Cytoplasmic 
dpt5:  No GFP detected 
a) For each of the mutants identify which step of the secretory pathway is blocked. (Assume all 
mutations are in proteins other than FruR.)

b) Which of the above mutations could be a result of an internal mutation in FruR? 
Explain what the mutation would be.

localization of other cellular proteins.  Below are the domain structures of the cellular 
proteins you are interested in (labeled 1-5).
