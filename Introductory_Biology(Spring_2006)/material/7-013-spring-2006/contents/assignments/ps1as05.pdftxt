Receptor proteins
growth factor receptors

a) The majority of the molecules that constitute a membrane belong to what

class of macromolecules? _______________________Lipid, Phospholipid_________

b) Explain the important qualities/properties of these molecules that allow them to form
membranes. Phospholipids possess hydrophilic “heads” and hydrophobic “tails” that allow them to assemble into a
bilayer containing a hydrophobic core when in an aqueous environment.They are Amphipathic. One hydrophilic end that
faces the aqueous solution, and one hydrophobhic end that faces another hydrophobic moiety on another molecule.

c) Which stretch of amino acids in the above sequence is within the interior of the
transmembrane region of the receptor? Circle these amino acids and briefly explain your
reasoning below.
The circled amino acids have hydrophobic side chains that reside within the hydrophobic
interior of the membrane.

When a “LIGAND” binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor, a conformational
change occurs in the receptor. Ligand binding causes dimerization of two adjacent
receptors in the cell membrane.  Upon dimerization, the intracellular domains of the
receptors become activated.  See schematic below.

c) Regions of the two receptors that interact upon dimerization are drawn below.  In

d) Gln12 is the 12th amino acid in primary sequence. Val 98 is the 98th amino acid in the
primary sequence. Explain how these amino acids are far apart in the primary sequence of
the protein yet are close to each other in the region of the protein diagrammed above.

When the protein folds into its final form, amino acid residues that are far apart in the primary structure
can be closely aligned to one another.

e) Molecular interactions between the two receptors are important for dimerization.
Thus, substitution of certain amino acids in the protein can affect receptor dimerization.

Predict whether the receptors will or will not be able to dimerize given the substitutions
(i - iv) below.  EXPLAIN your reasoning.

i) Asp68 → Arg

The receptors will not be able to dimerize because this substitution replaces a
negatively charged amino acid with a positively charged amino acid.  The ionic bond
between Asp68  and Lys65 is disrupted, and a repulsion occurs.

ii) Ser53 → Thr

The receptors will be able to dimerize because this substitution replaces a polar amino
acid that can participate in hydrogen bonds with another such amino acid.

iii) Phe50 → Asn

The receptors will be able to dimerize even though this substitution replaces a
hydrophobic acid with a polar amino acid because the van der Waals forces remain.
(Within the region diagrammed, the close proximity of the charged species makes it
unlikely that hydrophobic interactions are a key force in the interaction between the
two receptors.)

iv) Val98 → Ile

The receptors will be able to dimerize because this substitution replaces a
hydrophobic acid with another hydrophobic amino acid and the van der Waals forces
remain.

f) Substitution of one amino acid, Cys75 → Gly, leads to dimerization of the receptors
with or without ligand.  Provide a brief explanation for this observation.

This substitution positions two cysteine residues opposite each other. These two residues
can form a disulfide bond and thus covalently link the two receptors together.

Question 4

You have identified a new, rapidly reproducing species of dog that you have named the “mitbull”. The
mitbull is diploid and two autosomal chromosomes are shown. One chromosome carries gene A with
two alleles designated A and a.  The other chromosome carries gene B with two alleles designated B
and b.

a) Diagram mitosis in a heterozygous (AaBb) mitbull cell shown below. Draw your diagrams in the
outlines of the ovals adjacent to the stages. Include the alleles and the mitotic spindle in your
diagrams.
