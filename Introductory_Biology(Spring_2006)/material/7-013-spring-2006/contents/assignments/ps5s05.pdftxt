Problem sets will NOT be accepted late. 

Question 1 

In the autoimmune disease, myasthenia gravis, antibodies are produced against one’s own 
acetylcholine (Ach) receptors in muscle.  The result of this antibody production can 
either lead to the degradation of the Ach receptors, or to impaired binding of 
acetylcholine. 

a) A post-synaptic muscle cell experiences action potentials similar to a neuron. See the 
wildtype (WT) diagram below.  Compared with the WT muscle action potential, which of 
the following muscle action potentials (#1-5) would you expect to see from a person with 
advanced myasthenia gravis.

b) Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that degrades acetylcholine in normal individuals. 
Which of the following is true? 

i) Drugs that stimulate acetylcholinesterase would improve myasthenia gravis.


ii) Drugs that inhibit acetylcholinesterase would improve myasthenia gravis.


iii) Drugs modulating acetylcholinesterase would have no effect on myasthenia gravis.


Two other diseases affecting the neuromuscular junction are Lambert-Eaton syndrome and human 
botulism.  In Lambert-Eaton syndrome, an autoimmune disease, antibodies are produced against 
the presynaptic Ca2+ channels at the neuromuscular junction.  In botulism, a bacterial toxin 
prevents fusion of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. 

c) Calcium is important in synapses because… 

i) Calcium is physically required for binding of Ach to its receptor. 

ii)  Calcium  influx  in  the  axon  is  required  for  fusion  of  presynaptic  vesicles  with  the 
membrane. 

iii) Calcium prevents neurotransmitter from being degraded. 

d) If you isolated neurons from a person affected by L-E syndrome or botulism and 
stimulated it, which of the following action potentials would you likely see? (Normal action 
potential-shown by dotted line; affected action potential-shown by solid line.)

e) If you were to make a neuromuscular synapse between a Lambert-Eaton presynaptic 
neuron and a myasthenia gravis postsynaptic muscle, which of the following would you 
expect? 

i) Normal frequency of muscle action potentials


ii) Decreased frequency of muscle action potentials


iii) Increased frequency of muscle action potentials


f) If you were to make a neuromuscular synapse between a myasthenia gravis presynaptic 
neuron and a Lambert-Eaton postsynaptic muscle, which of the following would you expect 

i) Normal frequency of muscle action potentials 

ii) Decreased frequency of muscle action potentials 

iii) Increased frequency of muscle action potentials 

g) What is an ionotropic receptor? 

h) What takes place at the axon hillock?

Question 2 

As discussed in lecture and in Purves, pages 898-9, Long term potentiation, (LTP), is 
thought by many scientists to underlie learning and memory.  In the questions below, 
briefly describe each of the following events that are involved in LTP. 

a) How does an action potential result in the release of neurotransmitter into the 
synapse? 

b) What is the general name of molecules released from vesicles the presynaptic neuron 
into the synapse? What is the molecule released in LTP? 

c) To what do these molecules bind on the surface of the post-synaptic neuron? 

d) This results in an excitory interaction. What kind of ions flow into the cell as a result? 

d) After repeated cycles of LTP process, surface receptors on the post-synaptic cell ore 
up-regulated. (More appear.) How does this change affect the response of the post-
synaptic cell?  Draw your answer on the graph below relative to the curve labeled “before 
LTP”:

Question 3 

a) Which of the following assumptions is the “Ames Test” based on? Circle all that apply. 

i) Mutagens are likely to be carcinogens 

ii) Histidine is a carcinogen 

iii) Histidine is a mutagen 

iv) Bacteria cause cancer 

v) Many genes are carcinogens 

b) 
•	 You spread His- bacteria on a plate with medium containing Chemical X and lacking any 
histidine. No colonies are able to grow on this plate.  Is Chemical X a mutagen? 

•	 You grow His- bacteria on a plate lacking histidine with Chemical Y.  You see many 
colonies.  Is Chemical Y a mutagen? 

•	 You repeat the Ames test with Chemical X, but include this time rat liver enzymes. 
You now see many colonies.  Why is this result different from the earlier test? 

•  You repeat the Ames test with Chemical Y, but include rat liver enzymes this now. 
Now you see no colonies.  Why is this result different from the earlier test?

c) You decide to perform a different type of Ames test. This time you use the lac Z 
reporter gene, which encodes the ß -galactosidase enzyme that converts X-gal into a blue 
product. You use a modified lac Z gene that contains an internal repeat with the sequence 
GCGCGCGCGCGC.  This sequence does not impair ß-galactosidase activity. You generate a 
plasmid containing this modified lac Z (below), transform it into E. colibacteria.  You will 
use this as your strain in the Ames test to screen for white colonies on X-gal medium. 
These white colonies result from expansion or contraction of the GC repeat that renders 
the ß -galactosidase non-functional.

ß-galactosidase enzyme?

b) Below are Petri plates spread and incubated with the bacterial strain constructed on 
the previous page. Above each Petri plate an aerial and close-up view of one typical colony 
found on that plate is portrayed, each exposed to a different substance. Which 
substance appears to be most mutagenic?

X-gal medium

c) How did you determine b)? 

d) You observe that even when treated with the strongest mutagens that you can find, 
colonies have blue sectors. Why is this the case?
