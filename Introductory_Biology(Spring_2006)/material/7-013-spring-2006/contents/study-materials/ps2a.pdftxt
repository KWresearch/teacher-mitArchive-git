Problem sets will NOT be accepted late. 

Question 1 

Your friend, an expert structural biochemist, has managed to solve the crystal structure of Your 
Favorite Enzyme (YFE) bound to its regulatory subunit (for explanation of x-ray crystallography, 
see p. 440 of your textbook).  Through in vitro biochemical approaches, you have ascertained that 
the enzyme loses all activity when not bound to its regulatory subunit.  YFE catalyzes the 
following simple chemical reaction: 

YFE 
Lemons  -------------->  Lemonade 

One of your new goals is to perform site directed mutagenesis and pH dependence experiments 
with your protein and thus better understand the association between the enzyme and its 
regulatory subunit.  Site-directed mutagenesis involves selectively mutating single amino acid 
residues of a protein.  Your initial experiments concern the following stretch of amino acids: 

a) Draw the chemical structure of the side chains of the amino acids in the below figure.

enzyme.  Rationalize whether and why you will see a loss of activity of the enzyme by 
being specific as to how chemical bonds may be changed. [NOTE: Your explanation will 
constitute the majority of points awarded.]

e. Cys283->Ala  Loss – Disrupt disulfide bridge in enzyme

Question 2 

The structure of the lipid bilayer does not allow for many polar molecules to pass into the cell. 
Using genetic approaches, your lab has identified pair of proteins hypothesized to be involved in 
transporting two different molecules from outside of the cell into the cytoplasm. 

Through common biochemical assays, Protein A has been identified as a monomer at physiological 
concentrations.  You decide to analyze the amino acid sequence by constructing a hydropathy plot 
(which considers the relative hydrophobicity along the primary amino acid sequence—for example, 
tryptophan would be scored as relatively hydrophobic and serine would be scored as relatively 
hydrophilic).  Your analysis yields the following result.

a) Based upon the above hydropathy plot, and given that a transmembrane segment is 
about 20 amino acids long, might you expect Protein A to be embedded in the 
membrane?  If so, show how it would interact with the lipid bilayer below: 

Extracellular 

Cytoplasm 

(The protein should be associated with the membrane and should only cross once.)

You perform an identical analysis on Protein B and are puzzled by the results.  A 
hydropathy plot does not yield any indication of membrane localization.  Thankfully, your 
pal, an expert biochemist, has characterized Protein B as a homohexamer with strong 
alpha helical character.  Quaternary structural analysis predicts the following 
arrangement of molecules. 

Figure by MIT OCW. 
b) Would you expect this protein could serve the role of a channel for the transport of 
polar molecules? What is your reasoning after hearing of the above structural data. 
Because of the hexamer structure of the complex, it is possible that the protein spans 
the membrane.The alpha helical nature would allow for the protein to be “amphipathic”. 

c) Why is the alpha helical nature of the protein crucial to your assessment of its 
potential membranous or cytoplasmic localization?  Draw a possible orientation of a 
Protein B hexamer with respect to a lipid bilayer. 

Alpha helical rotations encompass 3.6 aa residues. Therefore, polar residues could point 
in toward the aqueous channel and hydrophobic residues could point into the bilayer. You 
cannot rule out a membranous localization for this protein based on the hydropathy plot 
cannot rule out a membranous localization for this protein based on the hydropathy plot.)

b) What type of bonds was made between one water molecule and another in the figure 
above?  Hydrogen bonds 

c) What property of molecular water allows for the structure you have drawn? 

unpaired electrons attract electropositive hydrogens from other water molecules – up to 4 H-bonds can be made per

water molecule. This is the case for ice. The polar character of water allows hydrogen bonds to form.


Consider the following thermodynamic data (DG=DH -TDS.) 

H20 (solid) 

‡ 

H20 (liquid) 

DH = + 5.9 kJ/mol 
DG=0, at 0°C 

d) Would you predict that the reaction is favorable at room temperature? __Yes____ 

e) Using your knowledge of the solid and liquid forms of water, explain why the DH of this reaction is

positive?  Considering your explanation, why does ice melt?

Considering your explanation, why does ice melt?

 Going from solid to liquid water requires the breaking of hydrogen bonds, which requires the input of 
energy. Ambient heat is responsible for the melting of ice at room temperature. Also entropy is increased 
in water as opposed to ice so both a higher temperature and positive entropy value is subtracted from the 
DH value resulting in a spontaneous reaction at room temperature.. 
f) Consider the following observation about tertiary structure of proteins – hydrophobic residues tend to 
be clustered and often buried deep within the protein.  Explain this observation using what you know about 
the favorable nature of hydrogen bonds. 

(It is energetically unfavorable for hydrophobic residues to be exposed to water. Water forms ordered structures 
around hydrophobic regions. It is favorable for hydrophobic residues to cluster so that water is removed from their 
environment and is free to form hydrogen bonds. This also increases the entropy or disorder, which is favorable for a 
free energy change.)

Question 4 

You have recently picked up a research project that was initially undertaken by a former 
student in your lab.  The project involves the biochemical characterization of a protein 
with a known enzymatic activity.  You pull out the student’s notebook and see the

a) Describe what is going on in this experiment.  Estimate a vmax and Km and write these on 
the graph above. 

A fixed level of enzyme is initially present with varying concentrations of substrate. The 
line is made by measurements from a series of experiments. Vmax is the maximal 
velocity at “maximal substrate”  Km is the concentration of substrate at half-maximal 
reaction velocity.). 

b) Why does the curve approach a maximum? 

The curve levels off because the amount of enzyme is small relative to substrate and it 
became saturated. 

c) On the same graph, draw the corresponding curve if twice as much enzyme was added 
initially in the experiment.  From your new data, estimate a vmax and Km and write these 
next to your new data.

Melting of double stranded DNA to single strands is an important technique in molecular 
biology.  Your favorite computer program predicts the below melting temperatures for 
the corresponding oligonucleotide sequences you plan to use for a technique called PCR 
(polymerase chain reaction).  In this process we will learn about later in the semester, 
the oligonucleotides will anneal to complementary DNA.

Melting temperature (Tm) 
50.2° C 
62.1° C 

b) Explain a possible reason for the disparity in melting temperature. 
The GC content is the reason for the difference in melting temperature 
c) What is the chemical basis for this disparity? G-C base pairs are capable of making more hydrogen bond 
contacts and thus form stronger bonds. Therefore, the more GC-rich, the higher the melting temperature. To understand this 
visually, consider the sites which could form hydrogen bonds in the nucleotides you have drawn above. There are three such sites in 
dCTP and only two in dATP.
