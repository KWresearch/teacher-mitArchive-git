Question 2

Harry wants to buy his friend’s parents some owls for their anniversary, but he doesn’t
have a lot of money.  He goes to the owl store anyways hoping to make an arrangement
with the owner. Turns out that a disgruntled employee managed to erase all of the
owner’s computer files containing the genetic information of the extensive owl collection.
If Harry can help the owner associate each phenotype with a genotype, he gets all the
owls he wants.

a) Harry notices there are both gray and brown colored owls.  If gray and brown hues are
determined by a single Mendelian locus what are all the genotypes that could correspond
to each of the two phenotypes if:

    
Figures by MIT OCW.
(Use H as your symbol for the dominant trait allele
and h for the recessive trait allele.)

i) brown is dominant to gray? 

i. HH, Hh = brown;  hh = gray

ii) gray is dominant to brown? 

ii.  HH, Hh = gray;  hh = brown

b) Harry sets up following matings, which always result in the same ratios of offspring
indicated below.

i) Based on the results of all three crosses, and using the same symbols as on the
previous page, what are the genotypes for each of the parents and offspring? Write
clearly adjacent to each F0 parent or F1 class.

F0                gray x gray

F1                 all gray

F0          brown x brown

F1             1 gray: 2 brown

F0            gray x brown

F1          1 gray: 1 brown

ii) Explain the ratios seen in the offspring for each of the crosses in i).

gray= hh; brown= Hh.

The first mating is between two homozygotes for the same allele, so all offspring will be
the same.

The third mating shows a test cross where a homozygote for the recessive allele (hh) is
mated to a heterozygote (Hh), and the offspring show the expected 1Hh:1 hh ratio.

The second mating is two heterozygotes mating (Hh x Hh), so the offspring will be
1HH:2Hh:1hh.  Since the ratio we see is 2brown:1 gray, the HH class must be lethal.

Question 2 cont.

Figure removed due to copyright reasons.

In a different and very cute species of owl, Harry notices that members of this species
emit two different noises which he names  “loud”  and  “quiet”, and that they have either
smooth or rough eyelids.  Harry sees a tank of very young owls, with no indication of who
the parents were.

a) Assuming all of these young owls come from the same mating pair and given the
following ratio of phenotypes that Harry tabulated below, what phenotype and genotype
were associated with the parents?  Use N and n to denote the alleles for noise, and E and
e for eyelid textures.

17  
loud and rough
 5 
loud and smooth
 6 
quiet and rough
 2     quiet and smooth
This boils down to a 9:3:3:1 pattern, indicative of the parents both being heterozygotes for the
two traits (NnEe), thus showing the dominant traits.  The dominant traits will be the largest class
of offspring.  Therefore the parents were loud and rough.
NnEe
b) Draw a Punnett square to show the genotypes of the young owls discussed in a) and
indicate which phenotypes correspond to these genotypes of the owls.

c) If Harry mates a randomly chosen loud and rough eyelided owl to any quiet and smooth-
eyelided owl, could he determine the genotype of the loud and rough owl by looking at the
offspring?
Explain how.

These are the four possible outcomes of choosing a random loud and rough owl to mate to a quiet and smooth owl, each
of which is different so you can determine the parent.

NNEE x nnee ->  NnEe = all loud and rough
NNEe x nnee ->  NnEe:Nnee = 1 loud and rough: 1 loud and smooth
NnEE x nnee ->  NnEe:nnEe = 1 loud and rough: 1 quiet and rough
NnEe x nnee ->  NnEe :Nnee,: nnEe: nnee = all four classes represented equally

d) Luckily, Harry finds some of these same cute owl species, whose genotypes for the alleles conferring
flight ability (normal flight speed vs. wicked fast flight speed) and beak length (long vs. normal) are written
on their cages.

i) Since he has all possible genotypes, what mating could Harry set up to determine if the two genes (loci)
conferring flight ability and beak length are on the same chromosome?

Harry can set up a test cross.  This is a mating between a heterozygote for both alleles and a
homozygote for both of the recessives alleles.

ii) What ratio of offspring classes would Harry get if the loci are unlinked?

The offspring show the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio of phenotypes, then the alleles are unlinked and are
on different chromosomes.

iii) How would this ratio change if the loci are tightly linked?

If the offspring do not show the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio of phenotypes, then the alleles are linked
on the same chromosome.  He would see a bias towards the parental phenotypes.

iv) How should he calculate the recombination frequency between the two loci?

The recombination frequency is the total number of recombinants divided by the total number of
offspring.

v) What does this number represent with respect to the DNA?

The recombination frequency is a measure of how close two alleles are to each other on a
chromosome; the closer they are the less likely there will be a recombination event between
them, thus a smaller recombination frequency.  A recombination frequency of 0.01 =1%  = 1 map
unit = 1 cM.

e) What would be the genotype(s) of your ideal owl? Explain why.

Question 4

 A woman with blood type O has a child with blood type O.  She claims that a friend of
hers is the child's father.  In the ABO system, IA and IB are both dominant to IO and
are codominant to each other.   ABO genotypes are summarized below and described on
page 187 of the 6th edition of Purves.

IAIA   and   IAIO
IBIB   and   IBIO
IAIB
IOIO

A
B
AB
O

a) Her friend’s  blood type is A.  Can he be excluded as the father on this evidence alone?
NO.
The mother is IOIO and the child is IOIO.  The man (with type A blood) could be IAIA or
IA IO.  If he is IA IO, he could contribute a IO allele, so he cannot be ruled out as the
child's father.

b) Does the fact that the accused man's mother has type A and his father has type AB
exclude him from being the parent?
NO.
His mother (type A) could be IAIA or IA IO. and his father (type AB) must be IAIB.  The
man could have type A blood (and the IA IO genotype) if his mother contributed her IO
allele and his father contributed his IA allele.  Therefore, this information cannot rule
exclude the man as the child's father.

c) Does the additional information that his mother's parents are both AB permit him to
be excluded?

YES.

If his mother's parents are both type AB (IAIB), then his mother must be IAIA and she
could not contribute an i allele to her son.  Therefore, the man must also be IAIA.  This
information would exclude him as the child's father. (Provided these are his real
parents.)

Question 5

Harry got his genetic savvy studying apple tree genetics.

He had a pure-breeding mutant strain of apple trees that has two unusual
characteristics; the mutant tree produces oranges instead of apples and there are huge
spikes growing out of the branches.  Harry crossed the mutant with a pure-breeding wild-
type apple tree. The F1 progeny produce oranges, but have no spikes.

F0:

Mutant orange tree with spikes

 X

Wild type apple tree

F1:

orange trees

a) For each pair, circle the dominant phenotype.

Apples    Oranges  

Spikes    No spikes

b) Harry performed a backcross of an F1 individual with an F0 individual from the mutant
strain. If there are 32 progeny trees from this cross how many trees have each of the
following phenotypes?

Apples, spikes        _____0_____

Apples, no spikes   _____0_____

Oranges, spikes      ______16____

Oranges, no spikes ______16___

Harry performed a test cross of an F1 individual (from the very first cross) with a tree
exhibiting both of the phenotypes that you have identified as recessive.  He got progeny
with the following characteristics.

Phenotype
Apples, spikes
Apples, no spikes
Oranges, spikes
Oranges, no spikes

# of individuals in F2 generation
103
903
897
97

c) What is the recombination frequency between the “orange” and the “spike” genes?
Show your work.

97+103/ 103+97+903+897= 200/2000--> 10%

_______10%______

Harry had previously identified a mutant apple tree whose branches are magical, and can
be used to make magic wands.  The gene that produces this phenotype (the “wand” gene)
was previously determined to be 6 map units away from the “spike” gene on one
chromosome.

d)  Based  on  the  above  data,  there  are  two  possible  arrangements  for  the  “orange”,
“spike”, and “wand” genes on the chromosome.   Draw them below naming the genes  in the
boxes and indicating between them the distances in map units.

Arrangement 1:

wand

6

spike

10

orange

Arrangement 2:

spike

6

wand

4

orange

e) What experiment could Harry perform to distinguish between these two possibilities?

A cross to determine the distance between orange and wand. A tree heterozygous  at
both the wand and orange loci crossed with the double recessive homozygote will lead to
information to determine the correct orientation.
