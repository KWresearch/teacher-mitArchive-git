Question 2

Harry wants to buy his friend’s parents some owls for their anniversary, but he doesn’t
have a lot of money.  He goes to the owl store anyways hoping to make an arrangement
with the owner. Turns out that a disgruntled employee managed to erase all of the
owner’s computer files containing the genetic information of the extensive owl collection.
If Harry can help the owner associate each phenotype with a genotype, he gets all the
owls he wants.

a) Harry notices there are both gray and brown colored owls.  If gray and brown hues are
determined by a single Mendelian locus what are all the genotypes that could correspond
to each of the two phenotypes if:

(Use H as your symbol for the dominant trait allele
and h for the recessive trait allele.)

i) brown is dominant to gray?

ii) gray is dominant to brown?

b) Harry sets up following matings, which always result in the same ratios of offspring
indicated below.

i) Based on the results of all three crosses, and using the same symbols as on the
previous page, what are the genotypes for each of the parents and offspring? Write
clearly adjacent to each F0 parent or F1 class.

F0                gray x gray

F1                 all gray

F0          brown x brown

F1             1 gray: 2 brown

F0            gray x brown

F1          1 gray: 1 brown

ii) Explain the ratios seen in the offspring for each of the crosses in i).

Question 2 cont.

Figure removed due to copyright reasons.

In a different and very cute species of owl, Harry notices that members of this species
emit two different noises which he names  “loud”  and  “quiet”, and that they have either
smooth or rough eyelids.  Harry sees a tank of very young owls, with no indication of who
the parents were.

a) Assuming all of these young owls come from the same mating pair and given the
following ratio of phenotypes that Harry tabulated below, what phenotype and genotype
were associated with the parents?  Use N and n to denote the alleles for noise, and E and
e for eyelid textures.

17  
loud and rough
 5 
loud and smooth
 6 
quiet and rough
 2     quiet and smooth

b) Draw a Punnett square to show the genotypes of the young owls discussed in a) and
indicate which phenotypes correspond to these genotypes of the owls.

c) If Harry mates a randomly chosen loud and rough eyelided owl to any quiet and smooth-
eyelided owl, could he determine the genotype of the loud and rough owl by looking at the
offspring?
Explain how.

d) Luckily, Harry finds some of these same cute owl species, whose genotypes for the
alleles conferring flight ability (normal flight speed vs. wicked fast flight speed) and beak
length (long vs. normal) are written on their cages.

i) Since he has all possible genotypes, what mating could Harry set up to determine if
the two genes (loci) conferring flight ability and beak length are on the same
chromosome?

ii) What ratio of offspring classes would Harry get if the loci are unlinked?

iii) How would this ratio change if the loci are tightly linked?

iv) How should he calculate the recombination frequency between the two loci?

v) What does this number represent with respect to the DNA?

e) What would be the genotype(s) of your ideal owl? Explain why.

The following diagrams show a diploid cell with 2 chromosomes, 1 and 2. The chromosome
derived from the mother is denoted "m", and the chromosome derived from the father is
denoted "d"

Question 4

 A woman with blood type O has a child with blood type O.  She claims that a friend of
hers is the child's father.  In the ABO system, IA and IB are both dominant to IO and
are codominant to each other.   ABO genotypes are summarized below and described on
page 187 of the 6th edition of Purves et al..

IAIA   and   IAIO
IBIB   and   IBIO
IAIB
IOIO

A
B
AB
O

a) Her friend’s blood type is A.  Can he be excluded as the father on this evidence alone?
Why?

b) Does the fact that the accused man's mother has type A and his father has type AB
exclude him from being the parent? Why?

c) Does the additional information that his mother's parents are both AB permit him to
be excluded? Why?

Question 5

Harry got his genetic savvy studying apple tree genetics.

He had a pure-breeding mutant strain of apple trees that has two unusual
characteristics; the mutant tree produces oranges instead of apples and there are huge
spikes growing out of the branches.  Harry crossed the mutant with a pure-breeding wild-
type apple tree. The F1 progeny produce oranges, but have no spikes.

F0:

Mutant orange tree with spikes

 X

Wild type apple tree

F1:

orange trees

a) For each pair, circle the dominant phenotype.

Apples    Oranges 

Spikes    No spikes

b) Harry performed a backcross of an F1 individual with an F0 individual from the mutant
strain. If there are 32 progeny trees from this cross how many trees have each of the
following phenotypes?

Apples, spikes         __________

Apples, no spikes    __________

Oranges, spikes      __________

Oranges, no spikes  __________

Harry performed a test cross of an F1 individual (from the very first cross) with a tree
exhibiting both of the phenotypes that you have identified as recessive.  He got progeny
with the following characteristics.

Phenotype
Apples, spikes
Apples, no spikes
Oranges, spikes
Oranges, no spikes

# of individuals in F2 generation
103
903
897
97

c) What is the recombination frequency between the “orange” and the “spike” genes?
Show your work.

_____________

Harry had previously identified a mutant apple tree whose branches are magical, and can
be used to make magic wands.  The gene that produces this phenotype (the “wand” gene)
was previously determined to be 6 map units away from the “spike” gene on one
chromosome.

d)  Based  on  the  above  data,  there  are  two  possible  arrangements  for  the  “orange”,
“spike”, and “wand” genes on the chromosome.   Draw them below naming the genes  in the
boxes and indicating between them the distances in map units.

Arrangement 1:

Arrangement 2:

e) What experiment could Harry perform to distinguish between these two possibilities?
