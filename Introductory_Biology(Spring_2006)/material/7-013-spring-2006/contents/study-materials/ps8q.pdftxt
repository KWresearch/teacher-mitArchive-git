Problem 1 

Exposure to mutagenic substances increases the risk of cancer. These substances can be 

found in some foods, dyes, cigarette smoke and industrial pollutants.  You suspect that a

this food additive, “Spicyo’s” that upsets your stomach may be causing cancer. In order 

to gather more data, you decide to examine the mutagenicity of “Spicyo’s”. 


One of the commonly used tests for mutagenicity is the Ames test, in which a bacterial 

strain (His-) cannot grow if there is no histidine in the medium. This bacterium cannot 

make its own histidine because the gene coding for a protein in the histidine biosynthesis 

pathway has a premature stop codon. If one were to mutate the stop codon back to the 

normal codon, the bacterium would now be able to make its own histidine and grow on 

medium lacking histidine. 


a) First, you plate His- bacteria on media with or without histidine. 

How many colonies would you expect on each plate? (none, very few, moderate, many) 


Medium with histidine 

__________ 

Medium without histidine 

__________ 

b) When you plate His- bacteria on medium without histidine, you occasionally see colonies 
come up with a low but constant frequency. You reason that these few colonies must have 
new mutations in their already mutant his gene that reverted them back to wildtype 
(changed the premature stop codon to a normal codon). 

How does this happen? What may be the mechanism by which these bacteria get 
mutations so that they revert back to wildtype with a low constant frequency? 

c) Now to test the mutagenicity of Spicyo’s! You mix it with His- bacteria and plate on 
both kinds of plates. How many colonies would you expect on each plate if Spicyo’s is 
highly mutagenic? (none, very few, moderate, many) 

Medium with histidine 

__________ 

Medium without histidine 

__________ 

Problem 2 

You are a physician treating several patients with cancer. You would like to know which 
mutations caused the tumors in two patients A and B. You isolate tumor cells from these 
patients and grow the cells in culture. The tumor cell lines, A and B, divide rapidly in 
culture. 
You carry out cell fusion experiments in which you fuse each of the tumor cells with a 
normal cell and examine whether the fused cells behave like tumor cells. 

Experiment

2. 

Normal cell 

Tumor cell A 

Normal cell 

Tumor cell B 

Tumor cell phenotype 

Normal cell phenotype 

a) Based on these experiments, indicate whether each tumor cell (A and B) has a mutation 
in a tumor-suppressor gene or a mutation in a proto-oncogene, and what kind of mutation 
(activating, inactivating, dominant and/or recessive) produced the mutant phenotype of 
the tumor cell? 

b) You would like to know if the tumors from two other patients C and D respond to 
radiation therapy. You irradiate the tumor cell growing in culture and observe whether 
the cells are killed by treatment. Tumor cells taken from patient C do not seem to be 
affected by the treatment, but the cells from patient D, like normal cells, stop dividing 
and then die by apoptosis (programmed cell death). Briefly explain how radiation 
treatment of cells inhibit cell growth and induces apoptosis. 

c) Based on the results from the radiation treatment, would you expect p53 to be 
functional in tumor cells from patients C and D? Explain you reasoning. 

Problem 3 

Retinoblastoma is a tumor that forms in the eye and is caused by mutations in the Rb 
gene. Children that have inherited one defective copy of the gene from their parents 
develop tumors in both eyes, whereas other children who develop retinoblastoma but 
don’t inherit a defective copy only develop the tumor in one eye. 

a) What class of cancer causing gene is the Rb gene? 

b) Why do heterozygous children are much more likely to develop tumors in both eyes? 

c) Many other types of cancers also contain mutations in the Rb gene. Since you know this 
you decide to sequence the Rb gene from a panel of tumors. Interestingly you do not find 
any mutations in the Rb gene in these tumors. You then look at the Rb protein in cell from 
these tumors and find that it is fully phoshorylated in all phases of the cell cycle. Briefly 
explain why the constitutive phosphorylation of the Rb protein would lead to tumor 
formation? 

Problem 4 

HIV is a retrovirus that infects TH cells of the immune system thereby causing AIDS. 
HIV genome is a single stranded RNA molecule. Two copies of this RNA genome are 
packaged with two molecules of the retroviral enzyme, reverse transcriptase within a 
protein capsid. This capsid is further packaged into an envelope derived from the plasma 
membrane of the host cell in which the virus was formed. The surface of the envelope is 
covered with an envelope glycoprotein called gp120. 

a) HIV specifically infects specifically the helper T cells of the immune system. If the 
virus must bind to a cell surface receptor on the T helper cells in order to gain entry into 
them, what protein on T helper would you predict serves as a receptor for the virus? 

b) Once infection takes place the RNA genome has to be made into double-stranded DNA. 
This process is mediated by reverse transcriptase. Once a double stranded DNA copy of 
the HIV genome is made, it is integrated into the host cell genome. What are the three 
steps required to produce double stranded DNA form the single strand RNA genome? 

c) The central dogma states that 
DNA 

RNA 

Protein 

Which one of these steps of the central dogma does the reverse transcriptase goes 
against? 

d) The drug that was most commonly used to combat AIDS was Azidothymidine (AZT). 
The structure of AZT is very similar to thymidine except that in AZT that in AZT the 3’ 
hydroxyl has been replaced by an azido (N3) group. Which process in the life cycle of 
HIV do you think AZT inhibits? 

e) AZT resistant forms of HIV have been isolated. These mutant viruses have mutations 
in one of the viral genes. In which viral gene do you think the mutations are most likely to 
be found? 

Problem 5 

A schwannoma (a tumor of the scwhann cells in the nervous system) is surgically removed 
from a person with one germline mutation neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene 
(heterozygous for NF2 gene).  DNA is isolated from the tumor, cut with a restriction 
enzyme, and hybridized with a polymorphic DNA probe closely linked to the NF2 locus. 
The following Southern blot pattern is seen, along with the pattern from analysis of skin 
DNA from the same person.

 Skin 

Tumor 

a) How many copies of the NF2 gene are present in each of the cells of the tumor mass? 
Does this suggest NF2 acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor? 

b)
 i) What are some of the mechanisms by which the one copy of the NF2 gene can be lost 
in the tumor cells? 

ii) What is the formal definition of this process? Loss of heterozygosity 

c) If the father of this person also has tumors associated with NF2 (therefore he is also 
a heterozygous), would you expect the father’s or mother’s allele to have been the one 
lost in the tumor of this person?
