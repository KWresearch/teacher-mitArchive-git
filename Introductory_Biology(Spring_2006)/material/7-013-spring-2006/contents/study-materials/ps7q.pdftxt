7.013 Problem Set 7 FRIDAY April 16th 2004 
Problem sets will NOT be accepted late. 

Problem 1 

a) What are the four features of the adaptive immune system discussed in Purves et al. 
that allow it to effectively fight a multitude of possible infections? Why is each 
necessary? 

b) How do the jawless fishes and invertebrates survive without an adaptive immune 
system?

Problem 2 

Shown below is a schematic representation of an antibody made in B cells. 

a) i) On the diagram above label the following structures on the antibody diagram. 

the heavy chains 

the light chains 

the variable regions 

the antigen binding sites 

the constant regions 

ii) If this were a secreted antibody, indicate on the diagram the region of the antibody

that would interact with phagocytic cells.


iii) If this were a membrane-bound antibody, indicate on the diagram the membrane-

spanning region of the antibody. 

b) What are the interactions between the light and heavy chains that make them 
associate with each other?

c) What are four ways in which variation is introduced into T- and B-cell receptors during 
T- and B-cell development? 

d) How does the immune system increase receptor avidity after T- and B- cell 
development? 

e) How are the various antibody classes different? What are the advantages of changing 
an antibody class? 

f) How does the body select effective, non-self T cells? 

g) Why do T- and B-cells recombine their DNA? Why not just use alternative splicing to 
create diversity?  (Hint: Think about the impact on descendant cells and their ability to 
fight an infection.)

Problem 3 

The Nasal-Spray Flu Vaccine (Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine [LAIV]) was recently 
introduced under the name FluMist as an alternative to the traditional flu shot. 

a) Besides the route of inoculation, how is FluMist fundamentally different from a flu 
shot? 

b) Why may FluMist be more effective than a flu shot? 

c) Why should people who are allergic to eggs not get a flu vaccine? 

d) What is a possible drawback of using a live, attenuated virus vaccine not shared with 
using the traditional flu shot? How does FluMist reduce the possibility of such a 
drawback? (Hint: Go online to find more information about the vaccine. Extra Hint: Not at 
flumist.com)

Problem 4 

A researcher is trying to purify a protein he is interested in studying.  He performs SDS 
polyacrylamide electrophoresis, which separates proteins by size, on what he believes to 
be his purified sample.  When he stains the gel with Coomassie blue (a dye that stains all 
proteins), he sees not only a band corresponding to the molecular weight of the protein 
he is interested in, but also a few other bands of lower molecular weight. 

The researcher thinks these might be proteolytic fragments of the protein he has 
purified, perhaps caused by an undetectable contaminating protease (i.e., cannot be seen 
on the gel).  To test this hypothesis, he decides to do a Western blot of his gel using a 
monoclonal antibody to the protein.  The only bands that show up on the blot are the one 
corresponding to the protein of interest and one of the lower bands. See below. 

SDS gel

 Western 

Since the antibody only bound to one lower band, can the researcher conclude that the 
other bands correspond to different contaminating proteins? Why or why not? If not, 
what other reagent(s) could make this a more informative experiment?

Problem 5 

a) When an organ is transplanted, the patient must take immunosuppressant drugs for the 
rest of his or her life.  Why is that? 

b) The exception to this is bone marrow transplants. What makes bone marrow different 
from, say, a kidney that the patient does not require immunosuppressants to live? 

c) What is a complication of bone marrow transplants that is generally not a concern in 
other transplants, and how is it obviated? 

d) Explain why, after a bone marrow transplant, the patient must often get an entire 
complement of vaccinations.
