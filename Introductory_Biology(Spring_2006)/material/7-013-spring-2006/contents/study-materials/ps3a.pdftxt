Problem sets will NOT be accepted late. 

Question 1 

Shown below is the sequence of a short eukaryotic gene.  Only the 5’ to 3’ sequence of the “RNA-like” or 
complementary strand of the template strand is shown.

 TGTTTGCCTC130  ATGT -3’ 

This is what’s known about this sequence… 

v RNA polymerase and associated proteins recognize the sequence ‘TATAAT’ and initiate 

transcription five nucleotides downstream of the sequence at position 18. 


v The intron splice sites have been determined to be ‘CUU’ (5’ splice site) and ‘AAG’ (3’ splice site). 
These sequences and the sequences between these sites will be spliced out as introns in the 
processing towards mature mRNAs. 

v The organism cleaves the RNA and adds poly-A tails immediately following the sequence ‘AGUUGG.’ 
These tails are 14 nucleotides long.  RNA is produced and processed in the following order: 
transcription, splicing, polyadenylation, and 5’ capping. 

a) What is the sequence of the first 20 RNA base pairs of mRNA? Denote 5’ and 3’ ends.

b) What is the sequence of the processed, cytoplasmic-localized mRNA produced from this gene?

if the following point mutations occurred?

Question 3 

You’ve gained a position as a technician in a prestigious yeast lab.  Your first assignment is to learn the 
cellular localization of product of the gene, bio701, studied by the lab.  One exciting technique involves 
creating a protein fusion where your protein of interest is fused with GFP, green fluorescent protein. The 
resulting fused protein will fluoresce green when excited at the appropriate wavelength.  To make this 
fusion you must fuse the bio701 gene with the gfp gene. Certain vectors have been made that simplify the 
construction by allowing you to insert your gene in frame with the gfp gene. See below. 
BamH1 
Bgl II 

Promoter 

gfp 

pGFP

 7.5kb

You know that the Bgl II site sequence in pGFP is in frame with the gfp gene (such that

the AGA will encode arg (R) and the TCT will correspond to ser (S)). (see below)


The bio701 coding region is about 1500 bases long.

The actual sequence corresponding to proximal and distal ends of corresponding to the 

coding region bio701 is shown below. The middle 1.4 kb are not shown.


5’ATGaccatgggcgacaagaagagcccgaccaggcc... 
(1.4kb of internal base pairs) 
...gggcgacatgtcagcagtcaatgatgaatcttTGA 3’ 

The first ATG corresponds to the start codon for bio701. The capitalized TGA at the 
end corresponds to the stop codon of bio701. 

Since your goal is to make a protein fusion where the N terminus of Green Fluorescent 
protein is replaced by the Bio701 protein, you must engineer a DNA construct that fuses 
the bio701DNA in frame with the gfp gene sequence. 

And since you must design primers 20 nucleotides long to amplify bio701 from yeast 
genomic DNA you cleverly decide to engineer restriction sites at the end of these 
primers that will allow you to cut the resulting amplified product with BamH1 and Bgl II, 
and insert it into the BamH1 Bgl II sites of pGFP.  (You’ve checked that there are no 
BamHI or Bgl II sites within bio701.) These restriction sites are given below.  The 
arrows represent where the enzyme will cleave the DNA.

BamH1 5’-G 
 3’-CCTAG 
G-5’ 

GATCT-3’
BglII  5’-A 
3’-TCTAG 
A-5’ 

So first you design a primer to amplify bio701 in one direction with an engineered BamH1 
site attached at the 5’ end such that you will be able to cut the final amplified PCR 
product with BamH1 enzyme to insert into the BamH1 site of pGFP. Your primer looks 
like… 

Forward primer:  5’ ggatccatgaccatgggcga 3’ 

Your boss quickly looks at your design and approves. 
Design a primer to amplify the reverse direction with an engineered Bgl II restriction 
site that will allow you to digest the PCR product and then ligate it into the Bgl II site in 
frame with the gfp gene.

Your desired construct should look something like this:

gene 

After you have obtained bacterial transformants, you wish to isolate their plasmids to screen and 
determine that everything went correctly with the ligation. You pick 4 bacterial colonies and 
harvest the plasmid clones from them and perform restriction digests. Then you perform gel 
electrophoresis with the restriction digests. The results are as follows: 

Clone 1 
Clone 2 
Clone 3 
Clone 4 

BamH1

7.5kb, 1.5kb 
7.5kb, 3.0kb

Which, if any, of the clones could possibly be the right construct?__ Clone 3_____ 

Some of the clones are obviously not the desired construct.  Draw plasmid maps for what 
these constructs might look like, and give a plausible explanation for what may have gone 
wrong. 

Clone 1:  Bam H1 and Bgl II ends are compatible, no insert –they ligate together and cannot be recut 
Clone 2: Since Bgl II and Bam H1 are compatible ends, the insert went in the wrong direction, but 
destroyed Bam H1 and Bgl II sites so that they are no longer the same, and the resulting plasmid can’t be 
recleaved by these enzymes. 
Clone 4:  Two inserts were ligated into into the vector

Question 4 

You are given a plasmid that contains 8kb of DNA.  You wish to create a restriction map of this plasmid by performing a series of 
restriction digests.  After the digests are complete, you perform electrophoresis on an agarose gel and after staining the gel to 
visualize the DNA you measure the fragment sizes.
