7.013 Problem Set 2 
Friday, February 20, 

Problem sets will NOT be accepted late. 

Question 1 

Your friend, an expert structural biochemist, has managed to solve the crystal structure of Your 
Favorite Enzyme (YFE) bound to its regulatory subunit (for explanation of x-ray crystallography, 
see p. 440 of your textbook).  Through in vitro biochemical approaches, you have ascertained that 
the enzyme loses all activity when not bound to its regulatory subunit.  YFE catalyzes the 
following simple chemical reaction: 

YFE 
Lemons  -------------->  Lemonade 
One of your new goals is to perform site directed mutagenesis and pH dependence experiments 
with your protein and thus better understand the association between the enzyme and its 
regulatory subunit.  Site-directed mutagenesis involves selectively mutating single amino acid 
residues of a protein.  Your initial experiments concern the following stretch of amino acids: 
a) Draw the chemical structure of the side chains of the amino acids in the below figure.

b) For each interaction listed below, identify the strongest type of chemical bond or 
force expected between each amino acid pair. 

Choose from covalent, hydrogen, ionic, or van der Waals. 

a. Asp192:Arg205 

b. Val193:Ala206 

c. Glu194:Gln207 

d. Glu195:Lys208 

e. Cys283:Cys304 

c) Describe the expected results of the following mutations on the activity of the 
enzyme.  Rationalize whether and why you will see a loss of activity of the enzyme by 
being specific as to how chemical bonds may be changed. 
[NOTE: Your explanation will constitute the majority of points awarded.] 

a. Arg205->Ala 

b. Ala206->Leu 

c. Gln207->Asn 

d. Lys208->Arg 

e. Cys283->Ala

Question 2 

The structure of the lipid bilayer does not allow for many polar molecules to pass into the cell. 
Using genetic approaches, your lab has identified a pair of proteins hypothesized to be involved in 
transporting two different molecules from outside the cell into the cytoplasm. 

Through common biochemical assays, Protein A has been identified as a monomer at physiological 
concentrations.  You decide to analyze the amino acid sequence by constructing a hydropathy plot 
(which considers the relative hydrophobicity along the primary amino acid sequence—for example, 
tryptophan would be scored as relatively hydrophobic and serine would be scored as relatively 
hydrophilic).  Your analysis yields the following result.

a) Based upon the above hydropathy plot, and given that a transmembrane segment is 
about 20 amino acids long, might you expect Protein A to be embedded in the 
membrane?  If so, show how it would interact with the lipid bilayer below:

You perform an identical analysis on Protein B and are puzzled by the results.  A 
hydropathy plot does not yield any indication of membrane localization.  Thankfully, your 
pal, an expert biochemist, has characterized Protein B as a homohexamer with strong 
alpha helical character.  Quaternary structural analysis predicts the following 
arrangement of molecules. 

b) Would you expect this protein could serve the role of a channel for the transport of 
polar molecules? What is your reasoning after hearing of the above structural data. 

Figure by MIT OCW. 

c) Why is the alpha helical nature of the protein crucial to your assessment of its 
potential membranous or cytoplasmic localization?  Draw a possible orientation of a 
Protein B hexamer with respect to a lipid bilayer.

Question 3 

a) Draw the tetrahedral cage-like crystalline structure of water in its solid form with 
unshared electron pairs, etc.  Draw at least one water molecule and its nearest neighbors. 

b) What type of bonds was made between one water molecule and another in the figure 
above? 

c) What property of molecular water allows for the structure you have drawn? 

Consider the following thermodynamic data (DG=DH -TDS.) 

H20 (solid) 

‡ 

H20 (liquid) 

DH = + 5.9 kJ/mol 
DG=0, at 0°C 

d) Would you predict that the reaction is favorable at room temperature? 
_________ 

e) Using your knowledge of the solid and liquid forms of water, explain why the DH of this 
reaction is positive?  Considering your explanation, why does ice melt? 

f) Consider the following observation about tertiary structure of proteins – hydrophobic 
residues tend to be clustered and often buried deep within the protein.  Explain this 
observation using what you know about the nature of hydrogen bonds.

Question 4 

You have recently picked up a research project that was initially undertaken by a former 
student in your lab.  The project involves the biochemical characterization of a protein 
with a known enzymatic activity.  You pull out the student’s notebook and see the 
following graph:

the graph above. 

b) Why does the curve approach a maximum? 

c) On the same graph, draw the corresponding curve if twice as much enzyme was added 
initially in the experiment.  From your new data, estimate a vmax and Km and write these 
next to your new data.

a) Nucleotides are the building blocks for DNA polymers.  Draw the below dNTPs and 
indicate clearly the 5’ end and the 3’-hydroxyl. 

Deoxyadenosine 5’-triphosphate (dATP) 

Deoxycytosine 5’-triphosphate (dCTP) 

Melting of double stranded DNA to single strands is an important technique in molecular 
biology.  Your favorite computer program predicts the below melting temperatures for 
the corresponding oligonucleotide sequences you plan to use for a technique called PCR 
(polymerase chain reaction).  In this process we will learn about later in the semester, 
the oligonucleotides will anneal to complementary DNA. 

Oligonucleotide sequence 
TGTAACCATTATCATATTCATGAC 
AAGAGCGCTTGGTGCTTGCATT 

Melting temperature (Tm) 
50.2° C 
62.1° C 

b) Explain a possible reason for the disparity in melting temperature. 

c) What is the chemical basis for this disparity?
