Problem 6.1 (Ohanian, page 291, problem 13)
The masses of the two automobiles are m1 = 540 kg and m2 = 1400 kg and their
velocities, measured along the original direction of m1 , are v1 = 80 km/h ≈ 22.22 m/s
and v2 = −80 km/h ≈ −22.22 m/s.
(a) We are told that the two automobiles remain locked together after the collision.
After the collision both automobiles move as one, hence they both must have the same
velocity which must also be the velocity of the center of mass (vCM ). There are no
outside forces, so the velocity of the center of mass remains unchanged during the collision.
Therefore

vCM =

m1v1 + m2v2
m1 + m2

=

540 − 1400
540 + 1400

· 80 km/h ≈ −35 km/h ≈ −9.9 m/s

The velocity of the wreck is given by vCM . Note, it was unnecessary to convert from the
non-metric unit “km/h” if we wanted the value of vCM in units of “km/h”.

The total kinetic energy after the collision is

(m1 + m2 )v 2
CM

≈ 8.2 × 104 J

Note, it was necessary to convert from “km/h” to “m/s” to achieve an answer in units of
“J”.
(c) This calculation is best done in the center of mass frame. Since there are no
outside forces, this frame is inertial; hence the acceleration in this frame is the same as
the acceleration relative to the ground. We will make use of the kinematic relation

Problem 6.2 (Ohanian, page 292, problem 23)
This problem is illustrated in Figure 11.12 on page 292. Let m be the mass of each
steel ball. The ﬁrst steel ball swings and gains kinetic energy until it collides with the
second steel ball. Initially the ﬁrst steel ball is at rest at an angle θ relative to vertical,
so its height relative to the bottom of the swing is
h = l(1 − cos θ)

Its mechanical energy is

E = mgh = mg l(1 − cos θ)

At the bottom of its swing, just before the collision, its mechanical energy is

E =

mv 2
2

Conservation of mechanical energy gives

mg l(1 − cos θ) =

mv 2
2

=⇒

v =

(cid:1)

2g l(1 − cos θ)

Also in terms of just h, conservation of mechanical energy gives

mgh =

mv 2

=⇒

h =

v 2

(a) Because we are told the collision is elastic, we know that kinetic energy is conserved.
Momentum is also conserved. If we label the velocity, before the collision, of the ﬁrst steel
(cid:1)
ball v1 , and we label the velocity, after the collision, of the ﬁrst and second steel balls v

(cid:1)

Problem 6.3
Let mJ = 100 kg, mN = 80 kg, and mB = 10 kg. There are no outside forces acting
on John, Nancy, or the block, so momentum is conserved. Velocity will be considered
positive when it is directed from John to Nancy. Note that kinetic energy is not necessarily

3

conserved: John and Nancy can interchange internal energy with kinetic energy by sliding
and catching the block.
(a) Let vJ 1 be the velocity of John’s sled and vB1 be the velocity of the block after John
releases the block. The speed of the block relative to John’s sled is said to be 3 m/s, thus

Momentum conservation gives

vB1 = vJ 1 + 3

=⇒

0 = mJ vJ 1 + mB vB1 = mJ vJ 1 + mB (vJ 1 + 3)
=⇒
≈ −0.27 m/s
vJ 1 = − 3mB
mJ + mB
≈ 2.7 m/s

vB1 = vJ 1 + 3 =

3mJ
mJ + mB

(b) Let vN 1 be the velocity of Nancy’s sled after she catches the block. Momentum
conservation gives

mB vB1 = (mB + mN )vN 1

=⇒

vN 1 =

(c) Let vN 2 be the velocity of Nancy’s sled and vB2 be the velocity of the block after
Nancy slides the block to John. The speed of the block relative to Nancy’s sled is said to
be 3 m/s, thus

vB2 = vN 2 − 3
(Note that here it is “−3” and above it is “+3”. This is due to our choice for positive
velocity.) Momentum conservation gives
(mB + mN )vN 1 = mB vB2 + mN vN 2 = mB (vN 2 − 3) + mN vN 2
≈ 0.63 m/s
=⇒
(mB + mN )vN 1 + 3mB
mB + mN
vB2 = vN 2 − 3 ≈ −2.4 m/s
(d) Let vJ 2 be the velocity of John’s sled after he catches the block. Momentum
conservation gives

mJ vJ 1 + mB vB2 = (mJ + mB )vJ 2

=⇒

vJ 2 =

Initially there was no kinetic energy, but John converts chemical energy (stored in his

block is

There are internal forces involved when John catches the block. These forces again convert

Problem 6.4
The center of mass frame is deﬁned as the frame in which the center of mass is at
rest, so the two pucks must travel in opposite directions in that frame. If v1 and v2 are
the velocities respectively of masses m1 and m2 , then
v1 = − m2

Problem 6.5
The tennis ball and basketball do not collide until after the basketball strikes the
√
ground. Both balls fall the same distance, call it h; hence both have the same velocity,
2gh just before the basketball strikes the ground. The mass of the basketball is
v =
insigniﬁcant compared to the mass of the planet; thus the basketball will bounce back
up with the same speed, v . (We assume that the collision is elastic, i.e. kinetic energy is
conserved.)

Now the tennis ball and basketball collide. This collision is best viewed from the
frame moving with the basketball. In this frame the tennis ball travels at a speed 2v and
strikes the basketball at rest. The basketball is much heavier than the tennis ball, thus
the tennis ball will bounce back up with the same speed, 2v . (Again, we assume that
the collision is elastic.) In the original frame, the tennis ball has the speed 2v + v = 3v .

Therefore, the height it will reach is h

Problem 6.6
Let m = 6 kg, v = 350 m/s, m1 = 2 kg, v1 = 250 m/s, m2 = 4 kg, and v2 =
400 m/s.
(a) The total momentum before the collision is
Pbef ore = mv = 2.1 × 103 kg · m/s

The total momentum after the collision is
Paf ter = m1v1 + m2v2 = 2.1 × 103 kg · m/s

Therefore, Pbef ore = Paf ter , and momentum is conserved.

Therefore, Kbef ore (cid:8)= Kaf ter , and kinetic energy is not conserved.
(c) The center of mass velocity before the collision is

The center of mass velocity after the collision is

Vaf ter =

Therefore, Vbef ore = Vaf ter , and center of mass velocity does not change.
(d) First we must transform the velocities v , v1 , and v2 into the appropriate center of

Problem 6.7
Let mA = m and mB = 3m.
(a) The table is assumed to be frictionless, so the only other force is the spring force
which is conservative; hence mechanical energy is conserved. (Gravity and the normal
force are present, but if the table is level then these forces precisely balance and thus are
irrelevant.) Therefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is constant, and we can
evaluate it at t = 0, at which time both masses are at rest and the spring has potential
energy U0 .

E = U0

(b) In general if KA and KB are the kinetic energies of mass A and mass B and US is
the potential energy of the spring, then the mechanical energy is

E = KA + KB + US

Mechanical energy conservation gives

U0 = KA + KB + US

=⇒

US = U0 − KA − KB

(c) There are no outside forces acting on this system, so momentum is conserved.
(Again, gravity and the normal force are irrelevant since they cancel.) Therefore, the
total momentum of the system is constant, and we can evaluate it at t = 0, at which time
both masses are at rest.

P = 0

Now suppose at some time the velocities are (cid:14)vA and (cid:14)vB . Then

P = mA (cid:14)vA + mB (cid:14)vB = m (cid:14)vA + 3m (cid:14)vB

Momentum conservation gives

0 = m (cid:14)vA + 3m (cid:14)vB

=⇒

(cid:14)vB = − 1

(d) The result above demonstrates that the particles are always moving in opposite
directions. Thus if A is moving in the +x direction then B is moving in the −x direction.
(e) It is convient if we choose the center of our coordinate system to coincide with
the center of mass of the system. Let xA and xB label the position of mass A and B
respectively. Then by deﬁnition of the center of mass

0 = mAxA + mB xB = mxA + 3mxB

=⇒

xB = − 1

Then the force acting on A is

Thus the equation of motion is

This indicates that the motion is simple harmonic with frequency

ωA =

A similar argument for B yields

We are told that vi = 8 × 103 m/s, vf = 8.5 × 103 m/s, and uex = 2.5 × 103 m/s. If we
assume that the shuttle uses all its fuel, then Mf = 105 kg and Mi = MF + Mf where
MF is the mass of the fuel. We can solve the above equation for MF by the following

(b) The engines will burn until there is no more fuel.
If the initial mass of the
rocket and fuel is Mi = 2.85 × 106 kg and the ﬁnal mass of the rocket (with no fuel) is
Mf = 0.77 × 106 kg then the mass of fuel MF is
MF = Mi − Mf = 2.85 × 106 − 0.77 × 106 = 2.08 × 106 kg

If the burn rate is constant, then the burn time T is given by

We are told that the reaction products have a mass of 4.4 kg and that these products
have a kinetic energy of 4.2 ×107 J. If the velocity of this mass is u then
4.4 · u2
u = 4.4 × 103 m/s
