6.3 Sliding on Ice
John and his friend, Nancy, sit motionless on sleds on frictionless ice. John slides a 10 kg block across
the ice to Nancy at 3 m/sec relative to his sled (i.e. after the block is released, the relative velocity
of the block relative to his sled is 3 m/sec). Nancy catches it and slides it back to John at the same
speed of 3 m/sec relative to her own sled. John and his sled (without the 10 kg block) together have
a mass of 100 kg, and Nancy and her sled together have a mass of 80 kg.
a) What is the speed of John’s sled and what the speed of the block after John releases the block?
b) What is the speed of Nancy’s sled immediately after she catches the block?
c) What is the speed of Nancy’s sled and what is the speed of the block after she slides the block
back to John?
d) What is the speed of John’s sled after he catches the block?
e) What is the total kinetic energy of the block and the sled after John releases the block?
f ) What is the total kinetic energy of the two sleds and the block just after Nancy catches the
block?
g) What is the total kinetic energy of the sleds and the block just after Nancy releases the block?
h) What is the total kinetic energy of the sleds after John catches the block?
i) The kinetic energy is sometimes increasing. Where is that energy coming from?

6.4 Col liding Pucks – PIVoT
Two pucks of mass m1 and m2 , moving on a horizontal frictionless surface, undergo an elastic collision.
Prior to the collision, their speeds were v1 and v2 respectively, as measured in their center-of-mass
frame (the frame in which the center of mass is at rest).
a) What are their speeds, as measured in the center-of-mass frame, after the collision?
b) Can you make any statement about their directions of motion after the collision?
c) What was the total kinetic energy before the collision in the center-of-mass reference frame?
d) What was the total kinetic energy after the collision in the center-of-mass reference frame?

6.5 Surprising Bounce – Lecture Demo
In lectures we dropped a tennis ball on top of a much heavier basketball from a height of about 3
m. The tennis ball bounced up much higher than 3 m. Calculate how high the tennis ball bounced
up by approximating the bounce as the result of two one-dimensional collisions in which ﬁrst the
basketball bounced oﬀ the ﬂoor and then collided with the falling tennis ball. Thus, in this second
collision the two balls had velocities in opposite directions. Assume that the collisions were elastic.

6.6 Center of Mass Motion and Internal Energy
A 6 kg ob ject is moving in 1 dimension with a speed of 350 m/sec on a horizontal frictionless surface.
It explodes and breaks apart into one fragment of 2 kg and one of 4 kg with velocities along the
initial direction of motion of 250 m/sec and 400 m/sec, respectively.
a) What is the total momentum before and after the ob ject explodes? Is momentum conserved?
b) What is the total kinetic energy before and after the ob ject explodes? Is mechanical energy
conserved?
c) What is the center-of-mass velocity before and after the ob ject explodes? Does it change?
d) Answer the questions under a) and b), but evaluate all quantities in the center-of-mass frame
of reference. Do any of your conclusions change?

6.7 Oscil lating Masses on Frictionless Table – PIVoT
Two masses, A and B are connected by a spring. The mass of A is m, and the mass of B is 3m;
the mass of the spring is negligible. The spring, with spring constant k , is compressed so that the
potential energy stored in the spring is U0 . The system is placed on a horizontal frictionless table.
The compressed spring is released at time t = 0 at which time the two masses have zero speed.
a) What is the initial total mechanical energy of the system (A, B , and the spring)?
b) How much potential energy is stored in the spring when A and B have kinetic energies KA and
KB , respectively?
c) At some point in time the speed of A is vA . What then is the speed of B ?
d) If A is moving in the +x direction, in what direction is B then moving?
e) What is the period, T , of the oscillations of the two masses?

6.9 Space Shuttle
A Space Shuttle has to increase its speed by ﬁring its thruster rockets. The exhaust gas speed relative
to the Shuttle is about 2.5 km/sec, and the mass of the shuttle is about 105 kg. What is the mass of
the fuel used in increasing the speed from 8.0 km/sec to 8.5 km/sec ?

6.10 Saturn V
The Saturn V rocket was used in the Apollo program. It had an initial mass of 2.85 million kg. The
burn rate of the rocket was 13.8 × 103 kg/sec (about 14 tons per sec!), which delivered a thrust of
34 million Newtons. Its ﬁnal mass was 0.77 million kg (770 tons!). Assume that the entire launch is
vertically up. In the discussions in lectures (and in Tipler’s derivation) air drag was ignored. This, of
course is an over-simpliﬁcation, as air drag must play an important roll. You too may ignore airdrag.
Use g = 10 m/sec2 .
a) What was the exhaust speed?
b) How long did the engines burn (this is called the burn time)?
c) What was the acceleration at liftoﬀ ?
d) What was the acceleration just before the engines stopped?
e) What was the ﬁnal speed of the rocket?
