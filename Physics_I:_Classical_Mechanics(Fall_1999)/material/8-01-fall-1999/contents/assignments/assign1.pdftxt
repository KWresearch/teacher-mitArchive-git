1.1 Estimates and Uncertainties – Ohanian page 21, question 1.

1.2 Fundamental Units – page 21, question 14.

1.3 How to measure the thickness of one sheet of paper to a high degree of accuracy?

a) With a ruler, measure as accurately as you can the thickness (in mm) of your temporary
ﬁve-chapter copy of Ohanian (excluding the yellow front and back cover).
b) What is the approximate uncertainty (often called error) in your measurement (in mm)?
c) What is the percentage uncertainty (often called relative uncertainty or relative error) in your
measurement under a)?
d) Deduce from your answer under a) the thickness of one sheet of paper (in microns).
e) What is the uncertainty in the thickness of one sheet of paper (in microns)?
f ) What is the percentage uncertainty in your result of the thickness of one sheet?
g) Diﬀerent students may ﬁnd very diﬀerent values for the thickness (even if we take the uncer-
tainty in their measurements into account). Why is that expected?

1.4 Relative Uncertainties
There is a very large diﬀerence in the relative uncertainties of the measurements of (i) the length of
the student measured in lectures on 9/8, and (ii) the thickness of the femurs shown in lectures (see
the data on the 8.01 Home Page). What is the relative uncertainty (in %) for the student’s length,
and what for a typical value of the thickness of the bones? Why are the two so very diﬀerent?

1.10 Position, Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration.
The position, x (in m), of an ob ject that moves along a straight line is changing with time, t (in
sec), as follows:
x = +16 − 12t + 2t2
a) Make a plot of the position x vs. time from t = 0 to t = +6.
b) Make a plot of the velocity, v (in m/sec), vs. time from t = 0 to t = +6.
c) Make a plot of the acceleration, a (in m/sec2 ), vs. time from t = 0 to t = +6.
d) What is the velocity at t = 0, +2, and +4?
e) What is the acceleration at t = 0, +2, and +4?
f ) When is the velocity zero, and what then is the x position of the ob ject?
g) What is the average velocity between t = −1 and t = +3?
h) What is the average velocity between t = 0 and t = +6?
i) What is the average speed between t = 0 and t = +6?
j) At what time does the ob ject reverses its direction?

1.11 Car Crash and Seat Belts – page 49, problem 35.

1.12 Brain Teaser - Returning to the same Point on Earth.
A person starts walking at point A on earth. She walks 10 km to the south, stops, then walks 10
km to the east, stops, then 10 km to the north, and she is back at point A where she started. Find
all points on the surface of the earth that will meet this condition. Don’t miss any, there are an
inﬁnite number of them!

1.13 Human Femur.
Look at http://www.wcape.school.za/sub ject/biology/skeleton/femur.htm. You will see a human
femur on a scale roughly 2:1.

a) What is the ratio d/l as deﬁned in class (look at our plot on the 8.01 home page)? The ratio
d/l is independent of the scale. You will not be able to measure the average value of d as
deﬁned in class. This, however would make a diﬀerence of at most 10%.
b) What is the average value of d/l of the data in our plot? This value is substantially higher
than the value under a).
c) Can you come up with reasons why that may be the case. Frankly, I am somewhat at a loss.
Since humans walk on two legs, I had expected the value of d/l for humans, if anything, to be
higher, not lower, than the average value for the mammals in our plot as they walk on four
legs.
