4.1 Air drag on very smal l drops. Watch PIVoT under resistive force.
We release an oil drop of radius r in air. The density of the oil is 700 kg/m3 . C1 and C2 for 1
atmosphere air at 20◦ C are 3.1 × 10−4 (kg/m)/sec and 0.85kg/m3 , respectively. How small should
the oil drop be so that the drag force is dominated by the linear term in the speed (in lectures we
called this Regime I). In this regime, the terminal velocity is mg/C1 r . [m is the mass of the drop].

4.2 Drag force at very low speeds. Watch PIVoT under resistive force.
At low speeds (especially in liquids rather than gases), the drag force is proportional to the speed
rather than its square, i.e., F = −C1 rv , where C1 is a constant. At time t = 0, a small ball of mass
m is pro jected into a liquid so that it initially has a horizontal velocity of u in the +x direction.
The initial speed in the vertical direction (y) is zero. The gravitational acceleration is g .

a) Write down the diﬀerential equations of motion in the x and y direction.
b) What is the horizontal component of the ball’s velocity at time t?
c) What is the vertical component of the ball’s velocity at time t?
d) After how many seconds is the vertical speed 99% of its maximum value? What would that
be for the 1/4 inch steel ball bearing that we dropped in Karo Corn Syrup in lectures?
e) Answer the questions under b) and c) for the limiting case that t becomes inﬁnitely large.

4.3 SHO – page 405, problem 1. Watch PIVoT under simple harmonic motion.

4.4 SHO – page 405, problem 4. Watch PIVoT under simple harmonic motion.

4.5 Oscil lating Spring. Watch PIVoT under simple harmonic motion.
A 3 kg mass is attached to a spring. The period of oscillation is 0.4 sec. At t = 0, the mass has a
speed of 3 m/sec towards equilibrium, and its displacement from equilibrium is 0.1 m.

a) Calculate the position of the mass for all time t > 0.
b) When will the mass ﬁrst go through equilibrium; what then will be its speed, acceleration,
kinetic energy, and potential energy?
c) When will the mass ﬁrst reach a turning point; what then will be its speed, acceleration,
kinetic energy, and potential energy?

4.6 Vertical Spring – page 406, problem 11.

4.7 SHO - Tunnel through the Earth – page 410, problem 43. I did this problem on PIVoT .

4.8 Pendulum. Watch PIVoT .
At the end of a string of length 2 m hangs a bob with a mass of 3 kg. The bob is released from
rest with the string at 30◦ to the vertical [g = 10 m/sec2 ].

a) How fast is the bob moving at the bottom of the swing?
b) What is its kinetic energy at the instant when the string makes an angle of 10◦ to the vertical?
c) How would your answers under a) and b) change if the mass of the bob were 6 kg?

4.10 Pushing a Box – page 178, problem 10.

4.11 Rol ler Coaster – page 182, problem 52. Watch PIVoT under rol ler coaster.

4.12 Horizontal spring with friction. Watch PIVoT under friction (Spring on Table with Friction).
A 3.0 kg block rests on a leveled table. The coeﬃcients of friction between the block and the table
are µs = 0.30 and µk = 0.20. The block is attached to a wall by means of a horizontal spring of
spring constant k = 80 N/m. We pull on the block and stretch to spring and then let go with the
block initially at rest. Use g = 10 m/sec2 .

a) What is the maximum extension of the spring for which the block will remain stationary when
released?
b) The block is placed in this position and then given a very gentle push towards the wall. At
what position will the block reach its maximum speed?

4.13 Pendulum in action. I did this problem on PIVoT under pendulum.
A pendulum consists of a “massless” string of length l and a bob of mass m. We release the bob
(without speed) when the string is at an angle θ0 with respect to the vertical. A pin is located a
distance L below the top of the string. When the pendulum swings down, the string hits the pin.

a) What is the maximum angle α that the string below the pin makes with the vertical after
hitting the pin?
b) If the bob had been released with an initial tangential velocity v0 , what would then be the
maximum angle α. Does the direction of this tangential velocity matter?

4.14 Drop suitcase on conveyor belt.
a) A stationary suitcase is placed on a moving conveyor belt. Is the friction static or kinetic?
b) The belt is moving to the right. Thus, relative to the belt, the suitcase is moving to the left,
thus there is a force on the suitcase to the right. The suitcase accelerates to the right until it
reaches the speed of the belt. Is the work that friction does on the suitcase positive, negative,
or zero?
c) After the suitcase reaches the speed of the belt, what is the horizontal component of the force
acting on the suitcase?
