Problem  9.1 
(a)  John   does  no  work  on  the  computer  monitor.  John  does  exert  a  force  on  the 
computer  monitor,  but  the  monitor  does  not  move;  hence  there  is  no  work  done  by  John 
on  the  monitor.  (To  understand why  John  becomes  exhausted  if  he  does  no  work,  please  
see  the  last   paragraph  on  page  162.) 
(b)  When the  ﬂy  ﬂies in the jar with  constant  speed the net force on the  ﬂy  must be 
zero.   Thus   the  air  pushes   upwards  on  the  ﬂy,  and  the  upward  force  is  the  weight  of  the 
ﬂy.  According  to Newton’s third law, the ﬂy  must therefore push on the air with  the  same 
force.  Since the air is enclosed in the jar, this downward force is felt by  the  scale.  Thus 
the  scale  reading  remains   the  same. 

There is a transient period  while the  ﬂy  takes oﬀ (it pushes against the bottom of 
the jar)   as it is being  accelerated.  During  that period the  scale will  read  a higher value  
than before. 
(c)  When the jar is open, the  situation is very  diﬀerent.  Imagine that the  ﬂy  is  sitting  
on a tray, and  the tray is on the  scale, and  then it starts to ﬂy.  Clearly  the  scale will   read 
a  lower   value  as  the  ﬂy  is   ”gone”. 

In an open jar, with the ﬂy ﬂying in the jar, the  scale will  read  a lower value.   The  
ﬂy is  still pushing down on the air with  a force equal  to its own weight, but  now this force  
is not 100%  transferred  to the bottom of  the jar.  There is  “leakage”  to the outside world 
(outside the jar). 
(d)  We  can  ﬁre  the  rocket   with  such  an  impulse  as  to  bring  our  speed  to  zero.  Then 
earth’s gravity  will bring  us back  without  any  further  eﬀort.  If  our  speed in the orbit is   v 
then  the  impulse  required   to  come  to  a  temporary  stop   is  I  =  mv ;  thus  a  smaller  orbital  
speed  requires   a  smaller  impulse  which  requires  less  fuel.  Our  speed  is  largest  when  we 
are  closest  to  earth,  and  our  speed  is  smallest  when  we  are  farthest  from  earth;  therefore 
we  should  ﬁre  our  rockets  when  we  are  farthest  from  earth. 
(e)  Let  MR  be  the  mass  of  the  rock,  MB  be  the  mass  of  the  boat  and  anything  else  in 
it,   ρW  be  the  density  of  water,  and  ρR  be  the  density  of  the  rock.  With  the  rock  in  the 
boat,  the  amount  of  water   displaced  is

With  the  rock  at  the  bottom  of  the  pool,  the  amount  of  water  displaced  is

Since  the  rock  sinks,  we  know  that  ρR  > ρW  ; hence  V1  > V2  and  the  water  level  will   go  
down. 
(f )  Let  M  be  the  mass  of  ice  and  ρW  be  the  density  of  water.  With  the  ice  initially 
ﬂoating,  the  amount  of  water   displaced  is 

V1  = 

M 
ρW 

The  ice  melts,  and  the  corresponding  volume  of  water  is 

V2  = 

M 
ρW 

Thus  V1  =  V2  and  the  water   level  will  remain  the  same. 
Problem  9.2  (Ohanian, page 372, problem 16) 
Let  m  = 80 kg,  l  = 0.6  m,  and  h  = 1.2  m.  We  only  need  to  concern  ourselves  with 
a  cross-section  of  the  box  as  shown  in  Figure  14.34  on  page  372. 
(a)  Now  imagine   a  line  connecting  the  edge  of  the  box  which  remains  in  contact   with 
the  ﬂoor   with  the  center  of  mass.  The  angle  between  this  line  and  the  bottom  of  the  box 
is given by

L  =

H  =  L sin(θ +  φ) ≈  0.671 ·  sin(θ + 63.4◦ ) 

Therefore  the  potential   energy  is  given  by 

U  =  mgH  ≈  5.26 ×  102  ·  sin(θ + 63.4◦ ) 

2 

where  the  units   of  U  are  J  and  θ  must  be  measured  in  degrees.  The  height  of  the  center 
of  mass is   measured  relative to the ground.  When  θ  = 0  the  center  of  mass  is  at  a  height 
h  and  U 
0. =

(b)  The  critical   angle  θC  occurs  when 

θC  +  φ  = 90◦ 

=⇒ 

θC  = 26.6◦ 

(U  is  an  increasing  function  of  θ  for  θ < θC  and  a  decreasing  function  of  θ  for  θ > θC .)  
(c)  For  a  conservative  force  the  work  is  the  change  in  energy. 

W  =  U (θC ) − U (0) = 5.26 ×  102  ·  sin(90◦ ) − 5.26 ×  102  ·  sin(63.4◦ ) ≈  55.7 J 

Problem  9.3  (Ohanian, page 372, problem 18) 
Let  w  be the width   of  each book.  We will  use the  scheme illustrated by Figure 14.36 
on page 372.  You  ﬁrst place the top book.  Then you place the next book  so that its right 
most edge is directly  under the center of  mass of  the  ﬁrst book.  Then you continue adding  
books at the bottom in this fashion: place each book  so that its right  most edge is directly 
under  the  center  of  mass  for   all  the  books  above.  We  can  explicitly  work  out  the  ﬁrst   ﬁve 
books in the  sequence;   the pattern will be clear.  Let  xi  denote  the  right  most  edge  of  the 
ith  book,   and  choose  x1  = 0.  Then  the  shift  between  each  book  is  Δi  =  xi+1 − xi  and  the 
center  of  the  ith  book is given by  xi  +  2 .  Then

Problem  9.4  (Ohanian, page 377, problem 50) 
From   Table  14.1  on  page  366  we  know  that  the  Young’s  modulus  for  bone  is   Y  =

Problem  9.5  (Ohanian, page 408, problem 31) 
First  we  will   calculate  the  initial  moment  of  inertia  I1  and  the  initial  angular   fre­
quency  of  the  torsional  pendulum  ω1 .  We  will  make  the  approximation  that  the  balance 
wheel  is   a  thin  hoop.  The  moment  of  inertia  for  a  thin   hoop  is  given  in  Table  12.1  on 
page  309  as 

I1  =  M R2  = 1.5000 ×  10−8  kg ·  m 2 

1  ·  1.0 cm  =  5.0  ×  10−3  m.  The  period  of 
where  M  = 0.6 g  = 0.6  ×  10−3  kg  and  R  =  2
the  torsional   pendulum  is   supposed  to  coincide  with  one  second,  but  the  watch  makes  
1.2 ·  60  = 72  more periods per day  than it should.  The frequency  is then given by 

ν1  = 

24 ·  60 ·  60 + 72 
24 ·  60 ·  60 

≈  1 + 8.3333 ×  10−4  Hz

and


ω1  = 2πν1  = 2π  + 5.2359 ×  10−3  radian/s


We  can  use  I1  and  ω1  to  calculate   κ  from Equation (75)  on page 397.


2  ≈  5.9316 ×  10−7  m  ·  N/radian 
κ  =  I1ω1

We  want  to  adjust   a  screw  so  that  ν2  =  1  Hz  and  hence  ω2  = 2π  radian/s.  The  required 
moment  of  inertia  is  

I2  = 

κ 
2  ≈  1.5025 ×  10−8  kg ·  m 2 
ω
2 

We  must  therefore  increase  the  moment  of  inertia  by 

ΔI  =  I2  − I1  ≈  2.5 ×  10−11  kg ·  m 2


Now let  Ihoop  be  the  moment  of  inertia  of  the  wheel  without  the  screw.  Then

I1  =  Ihoop  +  mr 1

and

I2  =  Ihoop  +  mr 2

ΔI  =  m(r2

where  m  = 0.020 g  = 2.0 ×  10−5  kg  is  the  mass  of  one  screw  and  r1  and  r2  are  the  two 
2  ·  1.0 cm  = 5.0 ×  10−3  m 
radii  of   the  screw.  We  will   make  the  approximation  that  r1  ≈  1
and  then  calculate  r2 .

Therefore  we  need   to  move  the  screw  out  a  distance

Problem  9.6  (Ohanian, page 488, problem 17) 
(a) 	 We  can  use  Bernoulli’s   equation   to  solve  this  problem.


ρv 2  +  ρgz  +  p = constant

where  ρ  = 1055 kg/ m3 .  The  ﬂow  of  blood  is  slow  enough  that  we  can  consider   v  = 0 
throughout   the  body.  The  above  equation   becomes 

ρgz  +  p = constant 

Now  deﬁne  the  origin  of  z  to  coincide   with  the  heart,  and  let  p0  =  110  mmHg  =  1.46 × 
104  Pa.  Then  the  constant  is   given  by 

and


p0  = constant


ρgz  +  p =  p0 

=⇒ 

p =  p0  − ρgz


for  other   points   in   the  body.  For  the  feet,  z  =  −140  cm  =  −1.4  m,  and


pfeet  = 1.46 ×  104  − 1055 ·  9.8 · −1.4  ≈  2.91 ×  104  Pa  ≈  221  mmHg


where  g  = 9.8 m/s2 .  For  the  brain,  z  = 40  cm  = 0.4  m,  and


pbrain  =  p0  − 1055 ·  0.4 ·  g  = 1.46 ×  104  − 1055 ·  0.4 ·  9.8  ≈  1.05 ×  104  Pa  ≈  79.8  mmHg  

where  g  = 9.8 m/s2 . 
(b)  The  pressure   in  the  brain  is  still  given  by  the  expression  above 

pbrain  =  p0  − 1055 ·  0.4 ·  g


Now  g  = 61  m/s2 , therefore


pbrain  =  p0  − 1055 ·  0.4 ·  61  =  p0  − 2.57 ×  104  Pa  =  p0  − 196  mmHg 

The  heart  could   at  most  create  a  pressure  p0  =  190  mmHg,  so  the  pressure  in  the  brain 
will  be  negative. 
Problem  9.7  (Ohanian, page 489, problem 18) 
The  pressure  at  the  surface  of  the  liquid  is  p  = 1 atm  = 1.013  ×  105  Pa.  This 
pressure   must  be  able  to  support  the  mass  of  the  column   of  water  raised  in  the  tube.  Let  
A  be  the  cross-section  of  the  tube  and  ρ  = 1.0 ×  103  kg  be  the  density  of  water.  Then

The block  will   sink  until it displaces an equal  mass of  oil (ρO  = 8.5 × 102  kg/m3 ) and 
water (ρW  = 1.0 × 103  kg/m3 ).   (If the  block  is  too  heavy  then  it  will  sink  to  the  bottom.) 
Let  H  = 10  cm   = 10−1  m  be  the  height  of  the  box;  A  = 30  cm × 20  cm  = 6 × 10−2  m2  be

The  water   at  both   the  top   of  the  tank  and  the  hole  is  in  contact  with  the  atmosphere; 
hence  the  pressure   is   the  same,  patom .  The  velocity  at  the  top  of  the  tank  is  zero.   Note 
that  the  velocity  of  the  water   emerging  from  the  hole  is  given  as  if  it  fell  the  distance

Problem  9.11 
(a)  The ball displaces a volume  V  of  the liquid  of density  ρ; therefore the mass of liquid 
which  overﬂows   is  

M  =  ρV 

(b)  At  ﬁrst,  when   the  rod  is   approaching  the  water  but  when  the  ball  is  still  above  the 
water,  the  rod  is   carrying  the  full  weight  mg  of  the  ball.  However,  as  the  ball  is  pushed 
into  the  water,  the  rod  will   carry  less  weight  and  when  the  ball  is  fully  immersed,  the 
weight  even  becomes   negative;  the  rod  is  pushing  down  with  a  force  ρV g  −  mg  to keep 
the ball immersed.  The  water   exerts  a force (the buoyant force)  of  ρV g  upwards  on  the 

8


ball.  Since  action  equals   minus   reaction,  the  ball  will  exert  a  force  downwards  onto   the 
water   of  ρV g .  The   weight  of  the  container  with  the  remaining  water  is  W  − ρV g .  Hence 
the  scale  will   read   W  − ρV g +  ρV g  =  W .  Notice  that  this  is  independent  of  the  mass   m 
of  the  ball.  This  is   not  surprising  as  the  rod  is  carrying  the  weight  of  the  ball. 
(c)  The  buoyant  force  upwards  on  the  ball  is  ρV g  and  the  weight  of  the  ball  is   mg . 
Thus the tension (pulling  upwards at the  scale)  T  =  ρV g  − mg .  The  buoyant  force  ρV g 
is  upwards  on  the  ball,   thus   the  ball  will  exert  a  force  downwards  onto  the  water  of  ρV g . 
The  weight  of  the  container  with  the  remaining  water  is  W  − ρV g .  Hence  the  scale  will  
read  W  −  ρV g  −  T  +  ρV g  =  W  −  ρV g  +  mg .  Notice  that  in  the  case  that  ρV g  =  mg 
(neutral buoyancy) the answer under part (b)  and (c)  should be the  same.  The tension 
in the  string (c)   is then zero, and  the force needed for the rod  to keep  the ball immersed 
(b) is  also  zero.  The  scale  reads  W  in  both  cases.
