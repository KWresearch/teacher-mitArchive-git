3.8 Measurements of Friction Coeﬃcient
Use the two independent measurements made in lectures to calculate the static friction coeﬃcient;
include all uncertainties (in the mass and angles) in your answers. One measurement was made
without the use of the pulley (the block was sliding down hill); the other was made with the pulley
(the block was sliding up hill). Compare the results of the two measurements. If the two values are
not the same within the accuracy of the measurements, give some reasons to explain the diﬀerence.
You may assume that the gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s2 .

3.9 Pushing a Book against the Wal l.
You are holding a book against a vertical wall by pushing upwards with your hand. The angle
between your force and the vertical is α (< 90◦ ). The mass of the book is m and the coeﬃcient of
static friction is µ. If you push too hard, the book will start to slide upwards, if you don’t push
hard enough, the book will slide down.

a) Draw “free-body” diagrams for these two cases when the book is just about to start sliding.
b) Calculate the magnitude of your force (as a function of α) to just prevent slipping, in both
cases.
c) Calculate the force (as a function of α) for which the friction becomes zero. Evaluate your
result for α = 0◦ and 90◦ .
d) For what values of µ (as a function of α) is it impossible to make the book slide upwards?

3.10 Brain Teaser I – What’s the Use of Wide Tires?
Race cars have very wide tires. The maximum frictional force exerted by the road on the tires only
depends on the weight of the car and on the friction coeﬃcient between the tires and the road; thus
it is independent of the width of the tires (as demonstrated in lectures). Why then would race cars
have wide tires? (This problem is from “The Flying Circus of Physics” by Earl Walker, John Wiley
& Sons.)

3.11 Pushing a Box – page 154, problem 15.

3.12 Pul ley and Incline – page 157, problem 43.

3.13 Sliding Stick Across Fingers – Lecture Demo.
Hold a yardstick horizontally on your index ﬁngers and slide your ﬁngers together smoothly. The
stick slides ﬁrst on one ﬁnger, then on the other and it keeps alternating. This was demonstrated
in lectures. Try it for yourself, it’s great fun! Why does this happen? (This problem is from “The
Flying Circus of Physics” by Earl Walker, John Wiley & Sons.)

3.14 Spring – Oscil lations – page 157, problem 47.
Continue this problem:
We hang an ob ject of mass 3 kg on the spring of problem 47, and we make it oscillate in vertical
direction. Assume that the mass of the spring is negligibly small, and that g = 10m/s2 .

a) What is the angular frequency (in rad/sec)?
b) What is the period of the oscillations (in sec)?
c) What is the frequency (in Hz)?

3.15 Brain Teaser II – Not so Intuitive!
If you are standing at the equator at sunrise, where must you point a laser cannon to hit the sun
dead center? The entire sun has just become visible above the horizon.

Reminder.
There are 26 recitation sections. If you want to change, for whatever reason, please go to
