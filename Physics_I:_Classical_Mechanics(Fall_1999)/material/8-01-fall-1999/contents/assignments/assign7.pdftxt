7.2 Slingshot Encounters
Spacecrafts can gain in mechanical energy as they encounter a planet. This may appear as a violation
of the conservation of mechanical energy, but it is not. The gained energy is at the expense of the
orbital energy of the planet. The easiest way to see how this works in principle is to treat the problem
as a one-dimensional collision. Let the spacecraft have a mass m and just before the encounter a
velocity v , the planet a mass M and velocity V . Both velocities are relative to the sun and they
are in opposite directions. Thus the angle between v and V is 180◦ . Assume that the spacecraft
rounds the planet and departs in the opposite direction. Thus, after the encounter the velocity of
the spacecraft is in the same direction as V .
a) What is the speed of the spacecraft after the encounter in terms of m, M and the speed of the
spacecraft before the encounter and the speed of the planet before the encounter?
b) The speed of the spacecraft just before the encounter is 10 km/sec and the speed of the planet
13 km/sec (this is the orbital speed of Jupiter). What then is the speed of the spacecraft just
after the encounter?
c) If the spacecraft has a mass of 2000 kg, by how much has its energy increased?

7.9 A Classic! - Translation and Rotation PIVoT — Look under “non-conservation of angular momen-
tum” (you will also see some demonstrations there) and under “conservation of angular momentum”.
A rod is lying at rest on a perfectly smooth horizontal surface (no friction). We give the rod a short
impulse (a hit) perpendicular to the length direction of the rod at P. The mass of the rod is 3 kg, its
length is 50 cm, the impulse is 4 kg·m/sec, the distance from the center C of the rod to P is 15 cm.
a) What is the translational speed of C after the rod is hit?
b) What is the angular velocity ω of the rod about C?
c) What is the position of the rod 8 sec after it was hit; how far did C move, and what is the angle
between the direction of the rod and its direction before it was hit?
d) What is the total kinetic energy of the rod after it was hit?

7.10 The Amazing Yo-Yo! PIVoT
A yo-yo rests on the ﬂoor (the static friction coeﬃcient with the ﬂoor is µ). The inner (shaded)
portion of the yo-yo has a radius R1 , the two outer disks have radii R2 . A string is wrapped around
the inner part. Someone pulls on the string at an angle α (see sketch). The “pull” is very gentle and
carefully increased until the yo-yo starts to roll. Try it at Home; it’s Fun! You can watch the
demo on PIVoT! For what angles of α will the yo-yo roll to the left and for what angles to the
right?

7.11 This is a diﬃcult problem - It too is a Classic!
A solid disk with radius R1 is spinning about a horizontal axle l at an angular velocity ω (it rotates
freely; friction is ignored). The axle is perpendicular to the disk; it goes through the center S of the
disk. The circumference of this disk (#1) is pushed against the circumference of another disk which
is in all respects identical to #1 except that its radius is R2 , and it is at rest. It can rotate freely
about a horizontal axle, m, through P; m and l are parallel. The friction coeﬃcient between the two
touching surfaces (disk circumferences) is µ. We wait until an equilibrium situation is reached. At
that time disk #1 is spinning with angular velocity ω1 , and disk #2 with angular velocity ω2 .

a) Is kinetic energy of rotation conserved? Give your reasons.
Now imagine that you are doing this “experiment” and that you hold one axle m in your left
hand and axle l in your right hand; you keep them parallel.
b) Do you have to apply a torque while you are pushing the disks against each other?
c) Is the total angular momentum of the two disks conserved?
d) Calculate ω1 and ω2 in terms of R1 , R2 , and ω .
It is quite remarkable that ω1 and ω2 are
independent of µ and independent of the time it takes for the equilibrium to be reached; i.e.,
independent of how hard one pushes the disks against each other.
