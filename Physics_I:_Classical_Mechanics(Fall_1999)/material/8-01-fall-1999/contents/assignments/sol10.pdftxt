Problem 10.1
(a) We pull with a force F (both ropes combined). At the point O the sidewalk exerts
(cid:1)
an unknown force F
on the cylinder. The condition for just lifting the cylinder oﬀ the
street is N = 0 where N is the usual normal force the street exerts on the cylinder. We

by measuring all torques about O . (A torque is deﬁned as positive if it
can eliminate F
would cause the cylinder to roll up the sidewalk.) The condition for just rotating about
the corner is τ = 0 where τ is the total torque about O .

where FAPP is the total applied force and ∆L is the corresponding increase in length. It
is convenient to deﬁne a constant k as

FAPP = k∆L

k =

L

First we need to calculate the amount the rope is stretched, ∆, due to the weight of 400 kg
alone.

∆ =

M g
k

≈ 0.070 m

(a) We need to ﬁnd the additional force required to stretch the rope another 0.03 m.
F = k · 0.03 ≈ 1.78 × 103 N
=⇒

F + M g = k(∆ + 0.03)

(b) Let x denote the displacement down from equilibrium. (Equilibrium corresponds
to the rope length L + ∆.) The equation above gives the necessary applied force FAPP
to stretch the rope by ∆L; therefore the rope must exert a restoring force of equal and
opposite magnitude. Therefore for a displacement of x down from equilibrium, now with
the applied force not present, the total force is
FTOT = −k(∆ + x) + M g = −kx

where in the above, F is the total force down corresponding to the displacement x down
from equilibrium.
The above equation is valid for x such that ∆ + x > 0 (x > −∆ ≈ −0.07 m) because
if ∆ + x < 0 then the rope will develop slack and the restoring force will vanish and the
form of the above equation would have to change. For the present, the initial displacement
is 0.03 m with no initial velocity, so the motion will never create slack in the rope; hence
the above equation remains valid for all the motion. The motion is, therefore, simple
(cid:5)
harmonic in x with period

T = 2π ·

≈ 0.53 s

(c) With the initial condition of x = 0.10m with no initial velocity the motion will
create a slack in the rope. The mass will start at x = 0.10 m proceed through x = 0 to

x = −0.07 m at which point the rope will start to go slack and there will be no restoring
force, only the force of gravity. The motion will no longer be completely simple harmonic

You can only calculate a conservative lower limit to the amount by which the rope will
stretch. As we have seen in lectures, Hooke’s law (thus ∆L
L = F
Y A ) no longer holds near
the breaking point. The lower limit would be

Thus a conservative lower limit for the length of the rope is 5.44 m.
Problem 10.3

the density of the oil, and V be the volume of wood. For the water,

Problem 10.4
Let p0 be atmospheric pressure, ρ = 103 kg/m3 the density of water, M the mass of
the rod, A its cross-section area, d = 3 m its equilibrium depth, and x its displacement
down from its equilibrium depth. The equilibrium depth is given by

M g = ρgdA

The force equation is

p0A + M g − (p0 + ρg(d + x))A = M ¨x

where p0 + ρg(d + x) is the pressure at the bottom of the rod. If we use the expression
M g = ρgdA in the above equation we have

If we use the equivalent expression ρgA = M g

Notice that it was unnecessary to specify the value of kg · m/s0 to evaluate the expres-

oscillation at all.

Let ρ = 7.8 × 103 kg be the density of this steel. Now focus on one half of the
meter stick, and let x denote the distance from the axis of rotation to a particular bit
of length dx. If the cross-section area is A then the corresponding mass is dm = ρAdx.
The centripetal force required to accelerate this bit of steel is dF = dm · ω 2x = ρAω 2xdx

(cid:1)
be the height of air in the diving bell once it is immersed. Then p

at a depth of 15 m.

Therefore the water rises 2 − 0.81 ≈ 1.2 m.
(b) The air must be pumped in at a pressure equal to the pressure of the water at the
bottom of the diving bell, which is at a depth of 15 + 1.2 = 16.2 m. The pressure at that
level is

pf = p + ρgz ≈ 2.6 × 105 N/m2

where z = 16.2 m. The amount of air required at that pressure is pf V
◦
C = 288 K. The original amount of air is pV
and T = 15
RT . Therefore the number of moles
which must be added is (pf −p)V
. The mean molecular mass of air is 29 g. (Please see
RT
Example 3 on page 498.) Therefore the mass of air which must be added is
M = (0.029) · (pf − p)V

Problem 10.9 (Ohanian, page 512, problem 16)
We will assume that the air forming the bubble does satisfy the ideal gas law.

If the temperature and the amount of air remains constant, then the right-hand side of
the above equation is constant.

Problem 10.10 (Ohanian, page 512, problem 21)
The density of the external air is ρa = 1.20 kg/m3 . The mass of the balloon, etc.
without the air is Mb = 730 kg, and the volume of the balloon is Vb = 2200 m3 . If the
mass of the hot air inside the balloon is M and the equivalent mass of cold air (same
volume but atmospheric temperature) is ρaVb , then the condition for the balloon to just
lift-oﬀ is

ρaVb − M = Mb

=⇒

M = ρaVb − Mb = 1.91 × 103 kg

The balloon is open at the bottom, so the pressure of the air within is the same as the
pressure of the external air. The mass per mole of air is given in Example 3 on page 498

Problem 10.11 (Ohanian, page 513, problem 28)
Consider a slab of air with horizontal area A and height dh. The pressure diﬀerence
between the bottom and the top of the slab must support the weight of the air within the
slab.

pA − (p + dp)A − (A dh) · ρ · g = 0

=⇒

dp = −ρg dh

(2)

If we would assume that ρ is a constant, then we would derive the usual result for pressure,
but if the temperature remains constant with height, then the density must vary with
height. We can obtain a relationship between the pressure and density by using the ideal
gas law.

Problem 10.12 (Ohanian, page 535, problem 5)
The lateral loops act as gaps to allow for thermal expansion in the long oil pipelines.
Even for a small change in temperature, the increase in length of the pipeline could be
very large. This would prevent the pipeline from being attached rigidly at each end. The
loops allow each shorter section of pipe to stretch but prevent the net eﬀect from being
cumulative. Since the oil must still ﬂow loops must be used instead of simple gaps as in
bridges.
