10.1 Lifting a Drum up the Sidewalk
A cylinder of mass M and radius R is lying on the street against the sidewalk. The height of the
sidewalk is h. A rope is attached to the axis at each end (point P and Q) of the cylinder (we only
show point P in the ﬁgure). We pull on the ropes (with equal force) perpendicular to the axis at an
angle α with a horizontal plane so as to just lift the cylinder oﬀ the street.

a) What is the ratio of this force (2 ropes combined) to the weight of the cylinder? Express your
answer in terms of α, θ , M , and g .
b) At what angle of α is the ratio as described under a) a minimum, and at what angle is it a
maximum? Use θ = 30◦ .
10.2 Strain, Stress and Oscil lations
A mass of 400 kg is hanging from a nylon rope of length 5 m and diameter 1 cm. We pull the mass
down from its equilibrium position over a distance of 3 cm. (The stress is proportional to the strain.)
Since the mass of the rope is much less than 400 kg you may neglect it.
a) Calculate the force needed to do this.
b) The mass is now released and it starts to oscillate vertically. Is the motion a SHO? What is the
period of one oscillation?
c) We now pull the mass down 10 cm from equilibrium and we release it. The stress is still
proportional to the strain. Is the motion now a SHO?
d) How much mass can we hang on the rope before it breaks? Any idea how long the rope then is?

10.3 Archimede’s Principle
A uniform block of wood ﬂoats in water with two-thirds of its volume submerged. In oil it has 90%
of its volume submerged. What is the density of the wood and of the oil?

10.4 Archimede’s Principle and Oscil lations
A cylindrical wooden rod is weighted at one end so that it ﬂoats upright in water. The length of the
submerged portion of the rod is 3 m. The rod is displaced vertically from its equilibrium position
and released. What is the period of oscillation? If the atmospheric pressure increases by 5%, by what
fraction will the period change?
