Problem  5.1  (Ohanian,  page  205,  problem  22)

The  law  of   conservation  of  mechanical  energy  states  that


E  =  K  +  U  =

2mv
2 

+  U 

Please  see  the  Figure  8.14  on  page  205. 

First  consider   E  =  E1 . 
(a)  The  turning  points  occur  when  v  = 0  ⇒  E  =  U .  For  E1  there  is 
only  one  turning  point,  a  left  turning  point  at  x  ≈  0.2. 
(b)  The  speed  is  maximum  when  U  is  minimum.   For  E1  the  speed  is 
maximum  for  x  ≈  1.0.  The speed is a local  minimum   when  U  is  a local 
maximum.  For  E1  the  speed  is  local  a  minimum  for  x  ≈  1.6.  Also  for 
E1  there  is  a   turning  point  at  which  v  =  0;  thus  the  minimum  speed 
occurs   for  x  ≈  0.2.

(c)  The  orbit  is  only  bound   if  there  are  both  left  and  right   turning 
points.   For E1  there is   only  a left turning point,  so the  orbit is  unbound.  

Now  consider  E  =  E2 . 
(a)  For  E2  there is  a left  turning point  at  x  ≈  0.3  and  a  right  turning 
point  at  x  ≈  3.0. 
(b)  For  E2  the  speed  is  maximum  for  x  ≈  1.0.  For  E2  the  speed  is  a 
local  minimum  for  x  ≈  1.6.  Also  for  E2  there  are two turning points at 
which  v  = 0;  thus  the  minimum  speed  occurs  for   x  ≈  0.3  and  x  ≈  3.0. 
(c)  For  E2  there  is  both  a  left  and  right   turning   point,  so  the  orbit 
is  bound. 

Now  consider  E  =  E3 . 
(a)  For  E3  there is  a left  turning point  at  x  ≈  0.5  and  a  right  turning 
point  at  x  ≈  1.3. 
(b)  For  E3  the  speed  is  maximum  for  x  ≈  1.0.  For  E3  the  speed  is  a 
local  minimum  for  x  ≈  1.6.  Also  for  E3  there  are two turning points at 
which  v  = 0;  thus  the  minimum  speed  occurs  for   x  ≈  0.5  and  x  ≈  1.3. 
(c)  For  E3  there  is  both  a  left  and  right   turning   point,  so  the  orbit 
is  bound. 
Problem  5.2  (Ohanian,  page  205,  problem  25) 
The  Table  8.1  on  page   195  lists  the  two   quantities  you  need 

“Yearly  energy  expenditure  of  the  United  States” 
“Combustion  of  1  gal.  of   gasoline” 

8 ×  1019  J 
1.3 ×  108  J 

We  can  use  these  quantities  to   make  various  conversion  factors.  The 
amount  of  gasoline  required  by  the  United  States  per  year  would  be 

8 × 1019  J/per  year = 

8 × 1019 
1.3 ×  108 
≈  6.2 × 1011  gal.  of   gasoline/per  year

The  amount  of  gasoline  required  by  the  United  States  per  day  would 
be

Problem  5.3  (Ohanian,  page  207,  problem  43) 
(a)  The  total  force  that  6000  Egyptians  can  move  is 

6.2×1011

× 

gal.  of   gasoline/per  day  

F  = 6000 ×  360 N   = 2.16 ×  106  N


The  maximum  weight  M g  they  can  move  is  given  by


F  =  µkM g 

=⇒ 

M g  =

The  corresponding  maximum  mass  M  is


M  =

g 

≈  7.3 ×  105  kg 

(b)  The  total  power  that  6000  Egyptians  can   deliver   is 

P  = 6000 ×  0.20 hp  = 1.2 ×  103  hp 

Power  in  terms  of  force  and  velocity  is  given  by  the  relation


P  =  F v 

=⇒ 

v  =

P 
F 

= 

1.2 × 103 
2.16 ×  106

1  hp

1 N  

We  need  to  be  careful  because  the  unit  “hp”  is  not   a  metric  unit.  The 
conversion  is 

1 hp  = 745.7 W 

Thus  the  velocity   is  given  by 

v  =

F

≈   4.1 ×  10−1  m/s 

Once  we  convert  from  “hp”  to   the  metric  unit  “W,”  we  are  assured  the 
the  answer  has  the  units  of   “m/s.”

Problem  5.4 
Let  L  be  the  length  of   the  unstretched  cord,  h  =  100  m,  k  = 
100  N/m,  m  = 50 kg,  and let  x  denote  the  distance  the  bungee jumper 
has  fallen  from  the  bridge. 

(a)  Mechanical  energy  is  conserved  if   we  ignore  air  drag  and  if   we 
assume  that  no  heat  is  dissipated   in  the  string.  The  relevant   forces 
are  then  only  gravity  and  the  spring   force,  and  these  are  conservative 
forces;  thus  mechanical  energy  is  conserved. 

The  cord  will  not  stretch   until  she  has  fallen  a  distance  L.  Thus 
for  x < L  her   mechanical   energy  is  given  by 

Ex<L  =  mg (h − x) + 

2mv
2 

For  x > L  she  begins  to  stretch  the  cord,   and  her  mechanical  energy  is 
given  by 

Ex>L  =  mg (h − x) + 

mv 2 
2

+ 

k(x  − L)2 
2  

She  starts  from  rest   on  the  bridge,  so  her  mechanical  energy  is  given 
by 

E  =  mgh 

We  want  to  choose  L  so that  she  comes to  a stop just  above the  water; 
thus  her  mechanical  energy  at  the  point  is  given  by 

E  = 

k(h − L)2

Mechanical  energy   conservation  gives

(b)  The bungee jumper   will hang  freely  at the distance  d  above  the 
water  at  which  gravity  and  the  spring  force  balance.  This  is  given  by 

k(h − L − d) =  mg 

=⇒ 

d  =  h − L −

k 

≈   26   m 

Problem  5.5 
If the rotation rate was too fast, i.e.   the gravitational force was not 
strong  enough  to provide for the  centripetal force  needed, the  material  
at  the  equator   would  begin  to  move   outwards,  hence  the  planet   would 
not  be  stable. 
(a)  Section  9.1  beginning  on  page  212   calculates  the  acceleration 
at the  surface  of  a planet (assuming   a  spherical planet).  The  result is 
given in Equation (6)  on page 214.  With the  substitutions  ME  �→  M 
and  RE  �→  R,  the  equation  is 

g  = 

GM 
R2 

where  M  and  R  are  the  mass  and  radius  of  the  planet  respectively.   If 
the  planet  has  a  uniform  density  ρ  then  the  mass  is  given  by 

M  =

πR3ρ 

=⇒ 

g  =

πGRρ 

By  the  argument  above,  the  maximum  rotational  rate  of  the  planet  is 
given  when  this  acceleration  is  precisely  the  centripetal   force  for   the 
motion  of  the  material   at  the  surface.   This  corresponds  to  a  minimum  
period  T .  Circular  motion  gives  the  relation

Problem  5.6  (Ohanian,  page  239,  problem  15) 
Please  see  Figure  9.42  on  page  239. 

≈  6.9×103  s  ≈  1.9  hour  ≈  7.9×10−2  day 

The  center  of  mass,  located  at   rCM  = 0  in  the  ﬁgure,  is  given  as 

rCM  = 0  =  m2 r2  − m1 r1 

=⇒ 

m1r1  =  m2 r2 

Now  we  suppose  that  the  orbit  of  each  star  is  a   circle  centered  on 
rCM  =  0.  Then  the  centripetal   acceleration   for  the  motion  of  m1  is 
given  by

We  can  check   that  using  m1r1  =  m2 r2  ⇒  ω1  =  ω2  =  ω  where  ω  is  the 
period  of  the  binary  system.  We  would  like  to   make  this  equality,  i.e. 
symmetry  between  m1  and  m2 ,  more  apparent.

Problem  5.9  (Ohanian,  page  241,  problem  30) 
(a)  The  orbital  mechanical  energy  is given in  equation (27)   on page 
226.  Using  the  replacement  MS  �→  ME  and  the  values  m  =  3500  kg

≈ −2.18 ×  1011  J 

The  mechanical  energy  change  is 

ΔE  =  E2  − E1  =  −1.11 ×  1011  J 

(b)  Energy  is  required  to  raise  the  temperature  of   a  material;  and 
energy is  required  to   cause  a   material  to pass from  one phase  to  another  
phase.  (This latter process  occurs  at one  temperature.)   Energy is  often 

9


 
expressed  as  a  calorie for  such  considerations.  The  conversion  to Joules 
is 

1  cal  = 4.187  J 

The  “heat  of   fusion”  for  aluminum  is  95.3  kcal/kg   ≈  3.99 ×  102  J/kg. 
This  is  the  amount  of   energy  required  to  cause  one  kilogram  of  alu­
minum  to  melt.  Thus  the  energy  required  to  melt  the  entire  satellite 
is 

Emelt  = 3.99 ×  102  ×  3500  ≈  1.4 ×  106  J 

(Actually  another  smaller  amount  of   energy  is  required  to  raise  the 
temperature  of  aluminum  to   its  melting  temperature.)  The  “heat   of 
vaporization”  for  aluminum  is  2520   kcal/kg   ≈  1.06 × 104  J/kg.  This  is 
the  amount  of  energy  required  to  cause  one  kilogram  of  aluminum  to 
vaporize (boil).  Thus the  energy required  to  vaporize the  entire  satellite 
is 

Evapor  = 1.06 ×  104  ×  3500  ≈  3.71 ×  107  J 

The  total  energy  for   both  processes  is  ≈  3.85  ×  107  J.  The  energy 
change  above  is  suﬃcient   to  cause  both  melting  and  vaporization. 
Problem  5.10  (Ohanian,  page  267,   problem   12) 
Let  m1  =  1500  kg  and  m2  =  3500  kg  be  the  mass  of   the  car 
and  truck  respectively.  Label  the  north  direction  by  the  y -axis  and 
the  east  direction  by  the  x-axis.  Then  the  car  has  velocity  v1  = 
80  km/h  = 22.2 m/s  along  the  y  direction,  and  the  truck  has  veloc­
ity  v2  = 50  km/h  = 13.9 m/s  along  the  x  direction. 

The  momentum  for  the  each  is  given  by

where  the  units  for  �p  are  kg  ·  m/s2 . 
(a)	  The  momentum  after  the  collision  is 

P� = (m1  +  m2)V� = 5000  V�

Momentum  conservation  gives 

P� =  p�1  +  p�2  = 4.865 ×  104  xˆ + 3.330 ×  104  yˆ

Thus  the  velocity   of  the  two  cars  after  the  collision  is 

V� =

5000

(4.865 × 104  xˆ + 3.330 ×  104  yˆ) = 9.73   ˆx  + 6.66  ˆy

The  magnitude  is

(9.73)2  + (6.68)2  ≈  11.8 m/s 
The  direction  is  given  by 

|V | =

�
This  means  that   both  cars  move  34◦  north  of   east.

The  change  in  kinetic  energy  is 

ΔK  =  Kaf ter  − Kbef ore  ≈ −3.6 × 105  J 

Thus  3.6 × 105  J  of  kinetic  energy  is  lost  during  the  collision.

Problem  5.11  (Ohanian,  page  267,   problem   13) 
The  force  of  impact  of   the  hydrogen  atoms  on   the  satellite  is,  as 
always, just  

�
F  = 

d�p
dt 

For  convience,  label  the  area  of  the  satellite  A  = 1.0 m2 ,  the  density  of  
ions  ρ  =  107  cm−3 ,  the  mass  of  each  ion  m  = 1.7 ×  10−27  kg,  and  the 
speed  of  each  ion  v  = 4 ×  105  m/s. 

Consider  a  small  time  interval,   Δt.  Then  the  ions  impart   a   small  
amount  of  momentum,  Δp�, to the  satellite.  This gives the  relationship 

�
F  ≈ 

Δp�
Δt 

which  will  become  exact  in  the  limit  Δt  → ∞.  (It  turns  out  that  if  
the  solar  wind  is  assumed  to  be  uniform  in  time,  then  the  relationship 
written  is  exactly  true  even  for  ﬁnite  Δt.) 

The  volume  of  solar  wind  that  strikes  the  satellite during   the  time 
interval  Δt  is 

V  =  AvΔt 

The  number  of  ions  in  this  volume  is 

N  =  ρV   =  ρAvΔt 

If  all  the  ions  stick  to  the  satellite,  then  the  momentum   delivered  to 
the  satellite,  along  the  direction  of  the  solar  wind,   is 

Δp =  mvN  =  mρAv 2Δt 

Therefore  the  force  is 

� Δp� mρAv 2Δt 
F  ≈ 
=
Δt 
Δt 

=  mρAv 2 

12


 
which  is  exact  in  the  limit  Δt  →  0.  Therefore  the  force  is  exactly 

F  =  mρAv 2  = 2.72 ×  10−9  N

where  the  direction  is  given  by  the  solar   wind.

(Be  careful.   The  M  here  is  the  mass  of  the  entire  section;   the  M  for 
Example  6  is  the  mass  for  only  the  “semi”  section.)  Now  we  need  to 
calculate  the  remaining  “rod”  integral.

rod 
But this integral is  clearly proportional to the z  component  of the  center 
of  mass  for  the  rod,  which  is  0.   We  can  also  see  this  because  z  = 0 
along  the  straight  section.  Therefore

The  mass  is  given  by 

M  =  Msemi  +  Mrod  =  ρAπR +  ρA2R  =  ARρ(π  + 2) 

and  then 

zCM  =

As  in  Example  6,   the  symmetry  of  the  masses  indicates  that

Problem  5.13  (Ohanian,  page  270,   problem   45) 
Let  v  = 5.0 ×  103  m/s  and  h  = 2.5 ×  104  m  and  m  be  the  mass  of   the 
ballistic  missile. 

Consider  the  equations  of  motion  for   an  ob ject  of  mass  m ′  with 
only  horizontal  speed  v  ′  at  an  altitude  of  h.  The  equations  of  motion 
give 

z  =  −

g t2

and  x  =  v  ′  t 

This  ob ject  will  strike  the  ground   at  the  time 

and  a  location

Problem  5.14  (Ohanian,  page  270,   problem   50) 
This  problem  refers  to  problem  5.10. 
(a)  The  translational  kinetic  energy  of  the  center  of  mass  before  the 
collision  is 

2 
(m1  +  m2 )vCM 
2 

=

�
P 2
2(m1  +  m2)

=

(m1  +  m2 )V

where  P� is  the  total  momentum  and  V 
is  the  velocity  of  the  center   of 
mass,  both  calculated  in  problem  5.10.  This  form  illustrates  that  the 
translational  kinetic  energy  is  conserved  if   momentum  is  conserved. 
Thus  the  value  is  given  by 

2 
(m1  +  m2 )vCM  = 
2

5000 ·  (11.8)2
2 

≈  3.5 ×  105  J 

The internal kinetic  energy  satisﬁes  equation (34)  on page 260

(m1  +  m2 )v 2 
CM

=⇒ 

Kint  =  K  − 

(m1  +  m2 )v 2 
CM

So  before  the  collision, 

Kint  =  Kbef ore  − 3.5 ×  105  ≈  7.1 ×  105  − 3.5 ×  105  ≈  3.6 ×  105  J 

where  the  value  of  Kbef ore  was  calculated  in  problem   5.10. 
(b)  The  translational  kinetic  energy  of  the  center   of   mass  after  the 
collision  is  the  same  as  before  by  the  argument  above.  The  value  is 
given  by 

(m1  +  m2 )v 2 
CM  = 
2

5000 × (1.18 ×  10−2)2 
2 

= 3.5 ×  105  J 

After  the  collision,  both  the  car  and  truck  move  as  one  ob ject,  so  there 
is  no  internal  kinetic  energy. 

Kint  = 0
