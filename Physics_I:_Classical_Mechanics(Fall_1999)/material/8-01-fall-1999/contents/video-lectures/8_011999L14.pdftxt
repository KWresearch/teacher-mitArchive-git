8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript – Lecture 14 

If you are s tanding somewhere on Ear th...  this  is the Earth,  the mass of the Ear th , rad ius o f the

Earth, and you're here .


And le t's assume for simplicity tha t there's no atmosphere that could in ter fere with us , and I want

to g ive you one huge k ick, an enormous speed, so tha t you never , ever come back to Ear th, that

you escape the gravita tional attraction o f the Ear th.


What should tha t speed be? Well, when you're s tand ing here and you have tha t speed , your

mechanica l energy--


which we o ften simply call E, the to tal energy--


is the sum of your kinetic energy--


this  is your mass; this  is your escape veloc ity squared--


plus the potential energy , and the po ten tial energy equals minus m Mg d ivided by the radius o f

the Ear th .


So th is is your kinetic energy and  this  is your po tential energy--


always negative , as we discussed be fore .


Mechanica l energy  is conserved , because gravity  is a conservative force .


So no ma tter where you are on your way to infinity , if you are at some distance r , tha t mechanical

energy is the same .


And so this should also be one-half m v a t a par ticular  location r squared minus m M ear th G

divided by tha t little r.


And so a t in finity, when you ge t there--


little r is  in finity,  this  is zero , potential energy at in finity  is zero--


and if I ge t U a t infinity with zero kine tic energy , then this term is also zero .


And that's the minimum amoun t o f energy tha t I would require to ge t you  to infinity and  to have

you escape the gravita tional pull o f the Earth .


If I give you a higher speed , well, then , you end up at in finity w ith a little b it ne t kinetic energy, so

the mos t efficien t way tha t I can do  tha t is to make th is also zero , so you reach infinity a t zero

speed.


So th is is for r goes to infinity.


And so this E equals zero  then .


And so this term is the same as this term for your escape velocity. 

And so we find that one-half m v escape squared equa ls m M ear th G divided by the rad ius o f the 
Earth. 

I lose my  little m, and I  find that the escape ve locity that I have to give you is the square roo t o f 
two M earth G d ivided by the radius o f the Earth .


And th is is enough, is sufficien t to ge t you a ll the way to in finity w ith zero kine tic energy.


If you substitu te in here the mass o f the Earth and  the radius o f the Earth, then you will find tha t

this  is about 11 .2 kilome ters per second .


That is the escape veloc ity tha t you need .


It's abou t 25,000 miles per hour .


Again, we assume  that  there is no a ir tha t cou ld inter fere with you.


If the to tal energy when you leave the Ear th w ith that velocity--


if the tota l energy is  larger  than zero, you do better than that.


You reach infinity w ith kine tic energy which is a little larger than zero .


We call this unbound orbit--


larger or equa l.


If E is sma ller than zero , tha t the  tota l energy tha t you have is nega tive , then you will never

escape the gravita tional pull o f the Earth , and you will be one way or another in wha t we ca ll a

bound orbit.


Let's pursue the idea o f circu lar orb its .


Later  in the course we will cover ellip tica l orb its , bu t now le t's exclusive ly talk abou t circu lar orb its .


Now, this  is the mass o f the Earth, and in a circular orbit is an objec t with mass m, a satellite , and

m is way , way , way smaller than the mass o f the Earth.


And the rad ius o f the orb it is R , and th is ob ject has a certain velocity v , tangential speed.


The speed doesn't change, bu t the direc tion changes, and there has to be a gravita tional force to

hold it in orbit, and  the gravitational force is exactly the same as the centripeta l force--


we've discussed that many times before .


And so the gravitational  force wh ich is necessary to make it go around--


I cou ld a lso say the cen tripe tal  force is necessary to make it go around in a circle--


that gravita tiona l force equals m M earth G divided by R squared .


This  is now  the distance from the Earth to  the sate llite, and tha t must be equal to m v squared 
divided by R , and tha t is tha t tangential speed that you see here , which a little la ter  in time , o f 
course, would be here. 

I lose my m, and so you see now tha t the orbital speed--

not to be mistaken  for escape velocity--

the orbital speed is exac tly the same what we have there except  the square root o f two divided by 
R.


This  is now R .


And there it was R ear th.


If you know R , then you can calcula te the speed in orb it.


If you know the speed in orbit, you can calcula te R.


And so the period o f going around in the orbit, T equals two pi R divided by the orbital speed, and

when you do that, you get two p i.


You ge t an R to the power three-halfs, and you have downstairs the square roo t of G M ear th.


Let me move this  in a little.


Two p i R  to the power three-halfs.


So again , if you know the rad ius, if you know how far you are away from the Earth, the period

follows un iquely .


If you know the period, then the dis tance to  the sa tellite fo llows uniquely.


If we take the shuttle as an examp le o f a near-Earth orbit, so we have the shu ttle.


The shuttle may be 400 kilome ters above the Earth's surface.


So we have to add to  the radius of the Ear th 400 kilometers, so you end up with abou t 6,800

kilome ters for the rad ius o f the orbit of the shuttle , and you substitu te that in here , the mass o f the 
Earth and the gravitational cons tant, you'll find tha t T is about 90 minu tes. 

It's abou t 1Ω hours.


The shuttle takes about 1Ω hours to go around , and the speed , tha t tangential speed , is very

close to e ight kilome ters per second.


And that holds for a ll near-Earth-orb it sate llites. 

Whether they are 400 or 500 or 600 kilome ters, that doesn't change very much. 

If you take the moon--

the moon is much fur ther away than the shuttle , and you take  the distance to the moon--

which is some 385,000 kilometers--

you substitu te that in th is equation , you will find  tha t the period  for the moon to go around  the 
Earth is abou t 27Ω days. 

And its speed is only one kilome ter per second . 

It's much  further ou t. 

If it's much fur ther out, R is much larger, and so you see the speed w ill be much lower. 

If you take the Ear th itse lf around  the sun--

because we can use all these equations--

replace the mass o f the Earth by the mass o f the sun , and then we can do  this for planets . 

So if we take the Earth around  the sun, then we have to pu t in the mass o f the sun, which is 
about two times ten to the 30 kilograms. 

And the d istance  from the Ear th to the sun , we have seen that be fore--

I call tha t the dis tance from the sun to  the Ear th--

is abou t 150 million kilometers . 

Forgive me  for mixing up me ters with kilome ters, bu t you have to conver t tha t, o f course , to

meters.


And when you calcula te how  long it takes the Earth to go around the sun, no surprise--


you will find 365Ω days .


So tha t's simp ly subs titution of these two quan tities  in the equation tha t I have here and tha t I

have here .


The ve locity o f the Earth in orbit is about 30 kilome ters per second .


That's a substan tia l speed, by the way , tha t the Earth is going around the sun--


30 kilome ters per second--


way higher than the speed tha t the shu ttle is  in around the orbit... around the Earth , which is on ly

eight kilome ters per second .


Jupiter  is five times further away than the Earth , and so the  time for Jupiter to go around goes

with five to the power 1Ω .


That's abou t 12, so it  takes Jup iter abou t 12 years to go around  the sun.


Notice that th is per iod is independen t o f the mass o f the little sa tellite, and that was very

unfor tuna te for the Americans when on October 4 , 1957, Spu tnik was  launched.


They cou ld find the radius very easily, because they knew the period that it took Sputn ik to go

around the Earth .


That was abou t 96 minutes .


They cou ld ca lcula te the velocity,  they cou ld ca lcula te the radius, but  they had no clue abou t the 
mass, and that was a key piece o f ingredient that the Americans wan ted , because if the mass 
was very large o f Sputn ik, that would indica te, o f course, tha t the Russians had very powerfu l 
rockets. 

You canno t tell the mass from the orb ita l parameters--

it's independen t o f mass . 

Whether you have a very light object or a very heavy satellite , they have the same velocity  in orbit

if they are at the same dis tance , and they have the same orbital period .


I men tioned earlier , notice  that  the orbital period and  the escape velocity vary by a square roo t o f

two if you are at a particu lar position .


For ins tance , you're a t a particu lar pos ition around the Earth, here at a sate llite .


If you want  to escape from this , you will need a speed which is the square roo t of two times  larger

than that orbital velocity.


And so if you wanted to escape from the Earth, then you need your 11 .2 kilometers--


we have it there .


If you are near Ear th in orbit, you are e ight kilome ters per second , and e igh t times the square root

of two is exactly that 11 .2.


So you see  the connection is a lways through  this square roo t o f two .


There is some thing remarkable about these numbers.


The to tal mechanical energy--


and I w ill write tha t once more here--


which is one-ha lf m v squared at a given radius minus  little m capital M G over r ; whether M is the

mass o f the sun or the Earth is of no concern to me now.


This  is the k inetic energy for some thing in orb it at  this radius, and this is the potential energy.


Bu t now no tice , I can subs titute now for this v squared,  I can substitu te the square o f th is--


that is the orb ita l speed--


and then I ge t M G over R .


And so this one equa ls one-half m MG over R .


And now compare the two.


They a lmost look  like carbon copies of each o ther, except tha t there is a minus sign here, which

is crucial, and there is a half here , which is missing here.


And so the tota l energy E--


which I've called the mechan ical energy--


always for a circular orbit is one-half U  and is the same as minus the kinetic energy.


A remarkab le co incidence , you would th ink.


It is not as much a coincidence as you th ink, of course .


Bu t if some thing is in orbit, this  is the orbital speed a t radius r,  then always  is  its to tal energy  is

half the poten tia l energy.


It's always nega tive .


Okay, later in  the course we will cover ellip tical orbits.


I will not do  that  today , and so I will march on to a complete ly differen t topic , and tha t is the top ic

of power.


So I will abandon for now  the orbits en tirely .


What is power? Power  is work tha t is done in a cer tain amoun t of time.


dw/d t, if w  is the work, is the instan taneous power a t time t.

We a lso know power in  terms of po litical power .


That's very differen t.


Politica l power--


you can do no work a t a ll in a lot o f time, and you have a lo t o f power .


Here in physics, life is not  that easy .


The units o f power are the units o f work, which is  joules per second, for wh ich we o ften write W ,

which is named after the physic ist Wa tt.


Don't confuse  this w for work with the W for wa tt, which is one joule per second .


Now, the work tha t I do , tha t the force is doing, is the dot product be tween  the force and a cer tain

displacement o f tha t force .


We have dealt with that be fore.


That is a little bit of work tha t I'm doing , r ight? I have a  force which is constan t during a short,

small displacement.


And so I can subs titute  tha t in there , and so I ge t tha t the power  is the deriva tive o f this versus 
time. 

And that is  if I keep this force constan t for that short amount of  time is the dot produc t times the 
velocity , because dr /d t is simply the velocity of that object.


So power  is a lso force dotted with the veloc ity .


If the force were perpendicu lar a t all times to the velocity vector,  then the power is zero .


Let's take an example .


I am on a b icycle--


here is my bicycle--


and I'm sitting on a bicycle here and  I'm trying to get go ing.


And I have a certain velocity , and I keep tha t ve locity constan t.


That's the way most peop le would ride their bikes.


Now, there is air drag , wh ich is unavo idable.


We d iscussed that.


And the a ir drag ac ts like a force on me, F drag , and so somehow,  I, Wa lter Lewin, will have to

come up w ith  the force in th is d irection to overcome  this drag so  that  the speed can be cons tan t,

because if the ne t force is zero on me, then of course I will have a cons tan t velocity--


no accelera tion, no change in the ve locity .


How do I do that? Well, I push on the peda ls.


Bu t the peda ls push back on me .


Action equals minus reaction.


So tha t causes no ne t force on the b ike a t all.


I push on  the pedal; the pedal pushes back on me;  those two  forces cancel.


We call them internal forces .


Now, the pedals push on the chain , and the chain pushes on the wheel, and ultima tely th is wheel

wants to star t ro ta ting in this d irection because of my pedaling .


And now here with the


with the floor , w ith  the road,  there is friction, and so now the wheel pushes onto the road , and the

road pushes back.


Action equal minus reaction.


And it is that force, which is really the  friction--


that is the force tha t Walter Lewin has to come up w ith in order to make sure  that he can go with

a constant speed .


It's the  friction tha t does  it.


You have to really think abou t it.


It's remarkab le.


If there were no  friction o f that road , you couldn't cycle.


I cou ld do this , and I would jus t s tay s till, righ t? There would never be any force here  that wou ld

drive me in this direc tion so you can go .


Of course, if you had a speed that you were sliding, then, o f course, you would always main tain

that speed.


I want you to appreciate  that  the power tha t I have to deliver is an extreme ly strong func tion o f the

speed.


If we are here in the domain o f what I called earlier regime two , which is the pressure-domina ted

regime , then the drag force is proportional  to v squared .


Let's say  it is a constan t times v squared.


We spen t a whole lec ture on this .


That's regime two .


Let's assume it's there.


Then if  I have  ten miles per hour here , I drive ten miles per hour , and I te ll you tha t the power th is

is a given , this  is not someth ing tha t I show you, that is  just a g iven, that  that is abou t a power o f

0.02 , 1 /50 , of a horsepower , and one horsepower  is some crazy unit--


400... 746 wa tts .


So th is is abou t 15 watts.


So I'm pedaling, and I keep my speed ten miles per hour, and I have to genera te 15 joules per

second on average .


Bu t now I want to go  to 25 miles per hour .


So here we get 25 .


That is 2Ω  times higher.


Bu t now the power that I have to generate is the dot product between the  force and the velocity.


Now, the  force and the velocity are in  the same direc tion, so the dot can disappear, so I get  that

the power  is k times v to the  third , and so now  if I want  the speed to go up by a  factor o f 2Ω , the 
power tha t I have to genera te is 2Ω  to the power  three times higher , and that is abou t 15  times 
higher, so now you're talking abou t 0 .3 horsepowers , and you're ta lking abou t some thing like 230 
watts . 

And that is quite a power, le t me te ll you. 

I wonder whether there are many here in the audience who could generate this for more than

even ha lf hour .


Most o f us could probably do it for a few minu tes, bu t not for hours.


It depends en tire ly, of course , on your condition .


There is also heat energy , and heat energy is expressed in a very different way .


We express tha t in terms of calories .


And a ca lorie is defined in a very special way as the energy which is needed  to increase one

gram of wa ter by one degree cen tigrade.


And so in general we can wr ite  that Q, which is heat energy, wh ich is in calor ies, is the mass o f

the objec t times the specific heat, which for wa ter would be one calorie per gram per degree

centigrade times the temperature increase  that we app ly.


So we increase the temperature o f an object.


The objec t has a mass m.


We increase the tempera ture by this much, so many degrees Kelvin or degrees centigrade--


that's the same--


and then th is is the number o f ca lories tha t you have to put in  there .


Um... I gave you  the specific hea t for wa ter in calories per gram, no t per kilogram.


If I gave it per kilogram, which may be nicer for this course, then of course it wou ld be thousand

instead o f one.


Aluminum has a spec ific hea t of 0 .2.


Lead is unusually  low--


it's only .03 .


It's very, very  low .


Ice is only half the specific hea t o f water.


Ice is only  ice is only one-half ca lorie per gram per degree cen tigrade .


The physicist James Joules, after we we call a fter h im the un it of work--


was the first to demonstra te tha t heat energy and mechanical energy are rea lly equivalent.


He did an ingenious experimen t.


Of course once you hear  it, you said , "We ll, I cou ld have though t o f it myself." He takes objec ts

with masses which hang from str ings and he lowers them in a gravita tiona l fie ld over a certa in

distance .


So he knows what mgh is.


And he uses this rope to rotate scoops which are in water.


And these scoops are driven .


There is mechan ical energy, mgh comes ou t in the scoops, and what does he no tice? Tha t the

temperature o f the wa ter goes up.


And he measures the increase in tempera ture , and he knows how the calorie was de fined, and so

he found that one calorie is approxima tely 4 .2 now  it's called joules.


At  that  time it wasn't called joules yet.


So there is a direct connec tion be tween the two .


I would like to ... I'm going  to throw several numbers at you during this  lecture, and I prepared a

view graph .


Don't copy the numbers, because it's a ll on the Web .


Bu t some of these numbers I w ill return  to, and  there fore I though t I migh t as well compile them in

one.


You see there on the top there tha t one calorie is 4.2 joules.


You also see the horsepower and o ther units tha t will come up very shortly are all defined there .


When we burn some thing , there is a chemical reaction which produces heat, in many cases.


Gasoline produces per gallon some thing like close to a hundred million joules .


Your body produces hea t.


Your body  is roughly at a tempera ture of 98 degrees Fahrenheit, unless you happen to run a high

fever today .


And your body  is radiating e lectromagnetic radiation.


You can't see it with your eyes, because it's  in frared .


Bu t when it's dark and you ho ld someone in your arms, you can feel that hea t.


That hea t is a  fantastic amoun t.


That is abou t 100 joules per second that you radia te--


100 wa tts .


You radia te at  the same leve l as a 100-wa tt light bulb, but it's , o f course, dis tribu ted over a much

larger area , so you're no t tha t hot as a 100-wa tt light bu lb.


Bu t it's a  fan tastic amoun t--


a hundred wa tts tha t you radia te for the s imp le fac t tha t your body has to be kep t at that

temperature.


It means tha t in one day abou t ten to the seven joules that you genera te.


Ten to the seven joules--


that is wha t you generate in terms o f heat, ten to the seven jou les per day , and tha t is about two

million calories per day.


Where does the body ge t it from? Food.


You be tter ea t two million ca lories per day.


Now, I can see some of you turn pa le and green and purple, and say, "Over my dead body ! "Two

million calories per day? ! You must be out o f your mind !" We ll, no t quite .


You see, when you read on the packages "calor ies," then it is called a cap ita l C-a-l and  tha t is

really a kiloca lorie .


So you have to divide  this by a thousand to compare it with the packages tha t you buy , how many

calories there is  in the food.


So you have to eat roughly daily abou t 2,000 kilocalories' equivalent o f food .


And if you ea t a lot more than that, well, you pay a price for  that sooner or  la ter.


How about mechanical work? Don' t we have  to eat also for all  the mechanical work tha t we do?

We work so hard, and I'm sure there must be a lot o f energy going into  tha t work .


Well, I have a surprise for you .


It's very disappoin ting .


The kind of work tha t you and I do in one day is so embarrassingly little in terms of mechanical

work tha t you can comple tely neg lect it.


Suppose we go up three floors .


We wa lk up three floors, which is about  ten me ters high .


And le t's say we do tha t three times per day.


And le t's give you a mass of about 70 kilograms .


It's abou t my mass .


How much work do I do when  I do tha t three times ...? Oh, le t me do it five times per day.


Boy,  I rea lly go out of my way .


Five times per day I go  three floors up .


Well, the amoun t o f work tha t I do is mgh.


mgh .


The ten meters have to be multiplied by five , because I do it five times , and so I get 35 ,000 jou les

of work that I do .


35,000 joules.


Compare  that with the ten to  the seven joules per day that your body generates in  terms of hea t.


You th ink you have  to eat a little b it more for these lousy 35,000 joules? Forget it--


it's noth ing.


In fact, your average power  if you did if you walked up these sta irs and you spread it out over a 
day, and say you 

it took you ten hours .


You go once up in the morning and then sometime  the afternoon , and you go up in the evening

and maybe tw ice in the evening.


It takes you ten hours to go five times up these three floors.


Then the average power tha t you have done, that you have generated, is 35,000 joules divided

by 36 ,000 seconds.


That is embarrassingly  little.


That's abou t one watt.


Compare  that with your body, which generates a hundred jou les per second every second--


100 wa tts .


So it is comp letely negligible .


However, if you climb a mounta in--


5,000 feet--


and you do that, then  the work you have to do is a million jou les.


Now, a million is no longer neg ligib le compared to the ten to the seventh.


And so now you  feel hungry , and now you rea lly need more food.


And if you do that in two hours, the power tha t you have genera ted is substantial.


You will have generated an average power of 160 wa tts--


more than the body hea t--


during those two hours, of course .


And so now the body says, "I want  to eat more.


I want to be compensa ted for the work if I c limb this mountain." If I climb 5 ,000  feet and I have to

do an extra work , wh ich is ten to the six  jou les, you got  to eat more.


Now, you would th ink tha t you have  to eat only ten percent more  than you normally eat, because

you say, "Ten to the six is only ten percent o f ten to  the seven." But that's no t true ; you have to

eat a lot more, because  the conversion from food to mechanical work is very poor--


something like 20%.


So you may have to ea t 40% or 50% more than you normally do in one day.


Suppose  I wanted to take a bath, and I wan t to calculate how much energy it takes to heat the 
bath--

a wonderful  thing to have. 

Well, we now know how to do  tha t. 

Q is the number o f ca lories, m times C times delta T--

that's the equa tion . 

A bath wou ld conta in abou t 100 kilograms o f water .


That is abou t 28 gallons.


And le t us assume tha t the temperature increase is about 50 degrees centigrade, wh ich is the

same as 50 degrees Kelvin.


We have wa ter, and so you'll find that Q then becomes roughly 5 ,000 kilocalories--


that's how much heat energy it takes--


which is two times ten to the seven joules .


So tha t's the energy that is needed to hea t up a ba th and enjoy tha t p leasure .


I'll ge t back to  this bath very shortly .


There are many forms of energy .


As we're all familiar with , there is elec tric energy, there is chemical energy--


I men tioned tha t already , gasoline burn ing--


there is mechan ical energy, when we move th ings  in a gravita tiona l field, and there is nuc lear

energy.


A water fall is mechanical energy--


mgh .


You can convert that to electricity.


You can convert it  to heat.


Elec tricity will power your co ffee machine .


It will power your TV, your radio , your VCR , your electric too thbrush--


everything .


It may power your elec tric b lanke t, if you have one .


Elec tric b lanket is only 50 watts.


Compare  that with a human being--


100 wa tts .


Much nicer to have a human being with you in bed than one elec tric b lanke t--


believe me.


[students chuckle]


LEW IN : Nuclear energy can be conver ted into heat, and that can be converted in to mechanical

energy and again in to e lectric ity .


Chemica l energy--


gasoline , fossil fuel can be burned , conver ted to hea t, converted to electricity.


I have here a device that allows me to conver t mechan ical energy to e lectric energy , and I would

like to invite a studen t to come up here , a volunteer, a he or a she , who is going to show how he

or she can conver t mechanical energy  in to electric energy.


We'll have the specia l ligh t conditions so  that we can see it well.


So , who wants to do that? Yeah , please come.


There is a 20-wa tt light bu lb here.


You will see it very shortly .


And th is man has a lot o f power, I can te ll.


More than 100 watts.


Go ahead .


Power that 20-wa tt light bu lb.


Pu t your foot on here .


Take it easy.


[appara tus trund ling ]


Quite impressive , eh? Okay, now we'll tigh ten the nuts a little on you.


Here we have six o f them.


So now go ahead , and now you are  trying to generate 120 wa tts o f power.


You th ink you can do it? STUDENT: I'll try .


LEW IN : Try it.


[appara tus trund ling ]


They look pre tty dim to me .


Nowhere near.


[appara tus trund ling ]


Nowhere near--


keep go ing, man , keep go ing !


[students  laugh]


LEW IN : You're no t even a t the leve l o f 120 wa tts .


It's hopeless. It's hopeless.

LEW IN : You can' t do it.


And even if you could do it, you would have  to do this for 48 hours  in a row to heat up my ba thtub.


Think abou t tha t.


For one ba th , 48 hours.


Bu t you can' t even do it.


120 wa tts  is too much .


I don't blame you--


I can' t do it either .


[students applaud]


There are batteries .


Ba tteries conver t chemica l energy to electr icity direc tly.


We are all used  to these fancy dry ce lls, bu t in the old days, and still nowadays in your car, there

are acid ba tter ies.


If I have here a beaker with acid, for which most commonly is used sulfuric acid, and I pu t here in

a zinc w ire and here in a copper wire , then this  is a ba ttery.


I be lieve this side o f the ba ttery is positive and th is is negative .


Now, we have them here.


We have  this su lfur ic acid and we have zinc and we have copper .


Bu t if we use on ly one cell, then I won' t be ab le to light a sma ll ligh t bulb .


Just like with your flash ligh t tha t you have a t home, you some times have to pu t in severa l cells in

series to ge t a h igher voltage so tha t you can power a small light bu lb.


The ligh t bulb that we have here is on ly a few watts.


It's almost no thing , and I will s till  try to get it lit, which is not so easy , because this ba ttery has a

self-destruc t in it.


The momen t tha t I pu t this zinc in there , I get very violent chemica l reactions.


The fumes are aw ful--


you may ac tually smell that in the first row ; it's very aw ful--


and the battery works only maybe for a few minu tes.


So I have to do this very fas t since it has a self-destruc t built in , and when I do it, I will make it a t

the very las t minute , I will make it comple tely dark.


So the way I will do tha t is, why don't we turn everything off? And now I leave a few  things on

first.


I can pu t the copper  in .


The copper  is no t the worst.


Let me  first pu t the copper  in .


That's pre tty  innocen t.


So I'm going to build four cells and pu t them in series , and I have  the copper now  in place .


So tha t's not the worst.


The momen t I pu t the zinc  in, then things begin to be very unpleasant, but when I make it very

dark, I close the circuit, and I hope you will be able to see the ligh t--


no pun implied .


So le t's leave some thing on and turn a ll the rest o ff.


I'm going to make it very dark very shortly.


First you s till have dim light.


Aah--


one thing goes in .


Ugh! I already smell it.


Two things go in .


And the third goes  in , and now I'm going to make it comple tely dark.


And now I have to close  the loop with the las t p iece of zinc.


Look a t tha t little light bu lb tha t is righ t there.


There it goes ! There ! I see the light! D id you see it? It doesn't last very long , bu t it's there. 

Boy, it was very brigh t, wasn't it? You saw  it, righ t? Unmistakable .


I have to get this out, because otherwise we will all be dead by the end of the lecture .


[students  laugh]


Okay.


And le t's cover these also up , because th is sulfuric acid--


ugh! So your  lead battery in your car works with the same idea , except th is is  lead oxide and this

is lead .


So it works w ith lead ox ide and lead , and it's a very, very powerful battery.


There are batteries which are very fancy which can be charged.


Nickel-cadmium is a battery tha t can be charged.


My e lectric shaver works on these ba tteries.


It's wonder ful.


If I forget  to shave in  the morn ing , I can s till do it before you come in here .


That's the great th ing abou t batteries .


This  is probably


this probably consumes 30 wa tts, 30 joules per second is my rough guess.


And I can probab ly ge t one hour of shaving ou t of that.


Probab ly shave six, seven times , so that's a to tal o f 100,000 jou les--


that's no t bad--


out of a battery .


And you can even recharge it.


Now, we a ll know when you really need ba tter ies, they're dead .


When you're in the mountains and you need your flashlight because it's really an emergency, it

just so happens tha t the ba tteries are dead.


And therefore almos t every moun taineer has with him or her a device wh ich conver ts mechan ical

energy in to elec tricity.


[device ratche ting]


And th is is  it.


Hey, you see no thing .


Oh, my  light bulb broke .


[students  laugh]


LEW IN : Oh, how sad .


[more laugh ter]


LEW IN : When you're in the moun tains , you see , things never work.


Let me see whe ther the bu lb may no t have been tigh t.


[Lewin chuckles ]


What a tragedy.


[device ratche ting]


No.


The ligh t bulb gave up .


I can' t show you  the ligh t.


Bu t you've seen it there .


I'm sorry--


that's the way it works.


I have to put a new  ligh t bulb in .


I'll give you back your view graph , because I'm go ing to ta lk about a few more numbers, and

they're all here , so you don't have  to copy any thing .


It'll a ll be on the Web .


The world energy consumption o f the en tire world o f six billion peop le--


by the way , the six billionth was born two days ago .


Have you heard abou t tha t on the radio? 6.00000 billion peop le now on Ear th--


is abou t four times ten to the 20 joules per year.


That is the en tire consump tion .


The United States has only 1 /30 of the world popula tion and consumes one-fifth of that.


We are really energy spoilers, big energy spoilers.


The sun is a wonder ful source of energy .


The sun has a power of  four times ten  to the 26 watts--


four times ten  to the 26 jou les per second--


mostly in  the v isible light and some in the in frared . 

If the sun is here and the Ear th is here , and you can calculate how much o f tha t energy reaches 
the Ear th at  the distance o f the Earth--

so you have to know the dis tance , but we know tha t;  that is 150 million kilome ters. 

And so tha t energy goes out radia lly, symme trically , iso tropically in all d irections, and so it's very 
easy. 

You know tha t the sur face area o f th is sphere is four pi  r squared , and so you can ca lcula te how 
much for every square me ter reaches the Ear th . 

And that is a classic number that almost everyone knows, cer tainly peop le who are in so lar 
energy.


That is 1,400 watts per square meter.


That is wha t reaches the Ear th .


That is abou t 100 million joules per square me ter every day.


It would be nice if we cou ld harvest that, and it would be nice if we could use that 100 million

joules per square me ter per day to provide the world with this four times ten to  the 20 joules per

year.


To do tha t, you would need ten to  the ten square meters to absorb that solar energy .


That's triv ial.


That's only the size o f Ho lland .


No big deal.


If we lose Holland,  that's no big dea l, so


[students  laugh]


However, there is a ca tch .


There is day and night, which we haven't allowed for ye t.


We jus t assumed tha t the sun was always there .


There are clouds.


And then the sun rises and the sun se ts, and o f course if the sun is a t the hor izon and here is

your plane where you  try to absorb the sun, you ge t no thing, so you have the cosine of  the angle

has to be  taken into account.


And then the e ffic iency o f the units tha t you're us ing, with which you cap ture the solar energy

could be solar cells .


It's a very  low efficiency.


And if you take a ll tha t in to account, you wou ld need an area more like 400 by 400 miles .


Now you're really talking .


That's someth ing like the whole of England and the whole o f France .

And so no t only are the costs s taggering , bu t it is simply beyond our present  technological 
capabilities . 

So solar energy plays a very small role in our world economy.


Nuclear energy, which is the fission of uran ium or plu tonium, was very popular in  the '70s, bu t it

has become a little bit less popular  la tely .


We had the Three Mile  Island acciden t in our own coun try, and you've heard just a few weeks

ago about the nasty acciden t tha t there was  in Japan .


So people are , unders tandab ly so , emo tionally strong ly biased aga inst the use o f nuclear energy .


Bu t nuc lear energy  is all around me , at leas t every day .


I have a very special co llection of F iestaware, which is American tab leware which was designed

and bu ilt in the  '30s, in 1937, and it went on un til the '50s.


And here I brought you some o f this .


This  is a ten-inch pla te, and  this  is called "Fies ta red." Even though it's orange , we s till call it

Fiesta red .


It has uranium oxide in it.


That red is uranium oxide .


That is the same uranium that powers nuclear reactors.


This  is coba lt; it has no uranium in it.


And th is, again, it's my cup o f tea--


radioactive .


Uranium oxide.


Okay.


You ready for th is? You hear  this? This  is a Geiger tube.


It can measure the gamma rays tha t the uran ium emits when it spontaneously breaks up in

pieces and energy is released--


we call that  fission .


You'll hear a little beep .


I'll hold it close to my microphone .


[rapid high-pitched beeping]


That's the p late from wh ich I eat.


[much slower beeping ]


This cup has no uranium oxide .


Bu t my cup o f tea

[rapid high-pitched beeping]


Radioactive.


So if you wan t to come  for d inner , you're more than we lcome to do so


[students  laugh]


LEW IN : Bu t you know wha t you're in for.


We have  fossil fue l on Ear th.


We are consuming a t this moment the fossil fuel at a ra te which is a million times fas ter than

nature could create it--


one million times faster .


And if we consume it a t the presen t ra te , or  increase maybe by only three percen t per year, then

we won' t have any le ft in less than 100 years.


So we have an energy crisis--


a real energy crisis.


And we have an environmen tal problem, because all these power plants and all the indus tries

cause pollution .


And so what are we going  to do about it? My own energy consumption is qu ite modes t, I think,

although I am also in your coun try, so  I'm sure I also consume six times more than the average

person in  the world .


I use elec tricity, for which  I ge t a bill.


I have gas hea t;  I heat with gas.


And I have also cooking with gas.


I use my car--


gasoline .


And when I add tha t a ll up, I  think I consume roughly 400 million joules per day .


That 400 million jou les per day  is the equ ivalen t o f having 100 slaves working for me like dogs 12

hours a day.


Think abou t tha t.


What a luxury, wha t an incredib le time we live in . 

One hundred slaves are working for every sing le person here in my aud ience 12 hours a day , 
working like dogs to make you live comfor tably . 

For one kilowatt-hour o f e lectricity, wh ich is four million  joules,  I pay only a lousy ten cen ts. 

My en tire energy bill for those 100 slaves  is no more  than $150 a mon th. 

What a bargain to have 100 s laves working for you for $150 a mon th. 

Bu t now comes the $64 million ques tion : How are we going to continue th is? Because we are

running out o f fossil fuel, and nuclear energy has its problems .


Well, the only way tha t we might survive--


the quality of life is a t stake here--


is nuclear fusion .


Not fission , whereby uranium and plu ton ium breaks up  in pieces, but  fusion .


If you could merge deuterium w ith deu terium, you ga in energy.


Now, we have one out o f every 6,000 hydrogen a toms on Earth is deu terium, and we have a

billion cub ic kilome ters of wa ter.


Now, it is unclear whe ther we w ill ever succeed in making a fusion reactor working .


That is still complete ly unc lear.


Peop le work hard on it.


Bu t if we succeeded,  then simply the oceans would provide the world , if we consume it at that

same rate that we are consuming today--


four times ten  to the 20 jou les per year--


we wou ld have enough energy for 25 billion years.


All the worries are over , because the Earth is not go ing to survive for any more  than five billion

years.


Five b illion years from now , the sun will become a hundred times bigger than it is now , and it will

just swa llow up the wor ld, and it w ill be the end o f MIT, of everything.


[students chuckle]


LEW IN : So all we have to  think of is  in terms o f energy  for about  five billion years.


I want to leave you with wha t I ca ll a bra in teaser .


I have here a very special ball.


And I'm going  to bounce th is ba ll, and I want you to look at it and tell me wha t you think  is the

source of  that energy.


It's  important that we have little ligh t, because if there's  too much light, then you won' t see it well.


So , this  is a ba ll.


See , I have another one here.


And I will bounce it here , and then notice wha t you see .


Just keep look ing.


It stops .


The other one . And the other one.


Now, I wan t you  to think about you've seen now what happens.


I bounce it, it star ts b linking .


Clearly, there's mgh available when  I bounce it.


Where does the energy come from o f the blinking light? Think care fully be fore you g ive an

answer.


It took my graduate s tuden ts and me , embarrassingly, at least ten minutes be fore we had the

answer.


Think abou t the fact tha t they con tinue  to b link and then stop .


Talk abou t it among yourselves.


Think abou t it when you have dinner , breakfas t, when you take your shower .


And discuss it on PIVoT.


See you next Friday.
