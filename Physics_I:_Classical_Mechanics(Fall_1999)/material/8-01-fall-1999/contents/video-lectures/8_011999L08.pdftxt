Transcript – Lecture 8 

Today we're going to  talk abou t friction , some thing ...


[students murmuring]


Please , I have a terrib le co ld.


My voice is down .


Help me to ge t through this with my voice--


thank you.


We're go ing to talk abou t friction which we have never dealt with .


Friction is a tricky thing, no t as easy as you may think .


I have an ob ject on a horizon tal surface .


The objec t has a mass , m, gravita tional force , mg .


This  is the y direc tion .


This cou ld be the x d irection.


There mus t be a  force push ing upwards from the sur face to cancel ou t mg because  there's no

acceleration in the y d irection.


We normally call tha t the "normal force" because it's normal to this sur face and it must be the

same as mg .


Otherw ise there would be an accelera tion in the y direc tion .


Now I am going  to push on this objec t w ith a force--


force Walter Lewin .


And we know tha t the object in the beginning w ill no t s tart accelerating.


Why is that? That's only possible because  there is a  frictional  force wh ich adjusts  itself  to exactly

counter my force .


I push harder and harder and harder and there comes a time  tha t I w in and the object begins to

accelerate .


It means tha t the fr ictional force--


which is growing a ll the  time as I push harder--


reaches a max imum value which it cannot exceed .


And that maximum value tha t the fric tion can achieve--


this  is an experimenta l fact--


is wha t's called the  friction coe fficien t mu which has no dimens ion,  times this normal force .


We make a d istinction be tween s tatic friction coe fficien ts and k inetic.


This  is to break it loose , to get it going .


This  is to keep it going when it already has a cer tain velocity.


The s ta tic is always larger than the kine tic for reasons that are quite obvious.


It's a little harder to break it loose .


Once it's going , it's easier to keep it going .


It is fair ly easy to measure a friction coefficient by putting an objec t on an incline and by changing

the angle o f the incline, increasing it.


This  is the angle alpha.


You increase it to the po int that  the objec ts start to slide down .


Here is the ob ject.


This  is the gravita tional force , mg which  I will decompose in two  forces: one in the y direction--


which I a lways choose perpendicular to the surface--


and another one in an x direction.


You are free to choose this plus or this plus .


I will now choose this the plus direction.


I am going to decompose them, so I have one component here and th is component equa ls mg

times the cosine of alpha.


And I have a componen t in the x d irection wh ich is mg sine alpha .


There is no accelera tion in the y d irection, so I can be sure that the sur face pushes back with a

normal  force, N and tha t normal force N mus t be exac tly mg cosine alpha because those are the

only two forces  in the y direction.


And there is no accelera tion in  the y direc tion so th is one must be mg cosine alpha .


Now this object wan ts to slide downhill.


Friction prevents  it  from doing so so there's going to be a frictional  force in this direction .


And as I increase the  tilt this fric tiona l force will ge t larger and larger and larger and  then there

comes a  time tha t the object will start to slide.


Let us eva luate tha t very momen t that it's jus t abou t to break loose .


I'm app lying New ton's Second Law.


In this direc tion , now, the acceleration is s till zero bu t the fric tional force has now  just reached the

maximum value--


because I increase a lpha--


so th is component will ge t larger and this component will ge t larger .


This component will get larger.


This component is still holding its own but  then all o f a sudden it can't grow any fur ther and it

starts to accelera te .


So Newton's Second Law  tells me tha t mg sine alpha minus F f maximum a t this point is zero .


And th is one is mu s tatic times N , which is mg cosine alpha.


This one is mg s ine alpha .


This equals zero.


I lose my mg , and you see  that mu of s equals the  tangent of alpha.


It's tha t easy to measure.


So you increase the tilt.


We will do tha t later un til it star ts to slip and then a t tha t critica l angle that it s tarts to slip you have

a value  for mu of s for the static fr iction coe fficien t.


It is very nonintu itive  tha t this fric tion coe fficient is complete ly independent o f the mass.


The mass has d isappeared.


Think abou t it--


it's very nonin tuitive .


If you double the mass, the ang le would be the same given the fact  that you have the same kind

of object.


The friction coefficient only depends on the materials that you have  the ma teria ls tha t are rubb ing

over each other.


It's also independen t of the sur face area tha t is in con tact with th is inc line which is equally

nonin tuitive.


It's very non intuitive, bu t we will see tha t tha t's qu ite accurate w ith in the uncer tain ties that we can

measure it.


If you have a car and you park your car you throw  it on  the brakes and you pu t it a t an angle and 
you increase the angle o f the slope the friction coefficient for rubber on concrete is abou t one so 
the tangent is one , so  the angle is abou t 45 degrees. 

So if  the road were 45 degrees, the car would s tart to slide independen t o f the mass o f the car--


no matter whe ther  it's a truck or whe ther  it is a small car--


independent o f the wid th of the tires .


It doesn' t enter  in to it even  though you may think  it does.


They would bo th s tart to slide at the same angle g iven the fact, o f course the same road and the

same k ind of rubber .


I first wan t to show you some o f this which is a t firs t very qualita tive .


I don't wan t it to become quantita tive yet.


The difficulty with these experimen ts are--


I'm going to use this plank here--


that  the moment that my fingers touch  this plank or touch the bo ttom o f any o f the objects tha t I'm

going to slide, then a ll hell breaks  loose .


A little bit of wa ter on the plank wou ld locally make the friction coefficients  larger .


My fingers have chalk on them.


A little bit of chalk on a local place wou ld make the friction coe ffic ient go down.


That's why, a t this poin t, we' ll keep it a little qualita tive.


The first  thing  I want to show you is, if I take a rubber puck and I pu t the rubber puck on this

incline and I have a plas tic b in--


this  is qu ite smooth, I pu t it on here--


that it's  immed iate ly intu itive  that  the fric tion coe fficient of this plas tic bin will be lower than of  the

rubber puck .


So when I increase the angle , you expect tha t firs t the plastic bin will s tart to slide and then the 
rubber puck . 

And if I gave you  the angles a t wh ich tha t happens you could ac tually calcu late  the two values for 
the fric tion coe fficient--

which I w ill no t do now , bu t I w ill do that la ter. 

So all I wan t you to see--

I hope--

that  this one will go earlier than that one . 

So I am go ing to increase  the tilt... I do it very slowly.


I try no t to ... rock the boat  too much , very slowly .


We must be approaching the critical ang le for the plastic.


Boy, it's ho lding on  to itself.


There it goes ... and the rubber goes a little later .


The rubber can be made rough by rubbing it on one s ide in which case the ang le w ill be even

larger.


I told you that the friction coefficien t is  independen t o f the mass o f the object.


I have two iden tical bins here ...


well, as far as they can be iden tical.


Maybe one at  the bottom is a little rougher than the o ther.


Bu t in one, I'm going to put 200 grams which is about five times the we igh t o f the bin.


And then, within reason when I tilt them, they will go a t the same ang le because it's  independent

of the mass.


So le t's try that aga in and see how close  they are.


It may be o ff by half a degree or one degree, o f course because the plank  is not uniform

everywhere.


And now  it's 18 degrees...19Ω... 20 ... 20Ω ...


21, and the o ther one is 21.2 .


So they almos t go a t the same time , so you've seen tha t apparen tly the mass has very small if

any e ffec t.


Now comes some thing  tha t I a lways find very, very non intuitive and  that is surface area .


I have two pieces of wood and  they're iden tical--


whatever that means, "iden tica l"; you can never make them exactly the same in terms of

roughness.


This sur face we prepared as we ll as we prepared this bottom surface .


Bu t this bottom sur face here is four times sma ller  in area than this surface area here , the  fla t par t.


I'm going to pu t the flat one here and I'm going to put  the same object--


but with its small area--


here.


If indeed the fr iction coe fficien t is independent o f sur face area , then when I tilt them they shou ld 
start to slide roughly at the same angle. 

There we go. 

14 degrees... 16 ... 18... one goes and the other one follows. 

It was  in two- ten ths o f a degree . 

And the reason why there's a lways some difference--

of course , the plank is no t exactly uniform.


I have to be care ful  that  I don't touch the critical sur faces.


So you have seen d ifference in fric tion coe fficien ts and you have seen there's almos t no e ffect on

surface area and there's no effect on the mass.


And that is both very nonin tuitive .


The w idth o f the  tires o f your car does no t ma tter .


And that... I ask you the question to expla in--


in your assignmen t number three--


why race cars have very wide tires.


There mus t be a reason for tha t.


I want you to think abou t tha t.


There is another way that one can measure the fric tion coefficien t wh ich is way more complica ted 
and rea lly, that's no t the reason why I want you to see it. 

The reason why I want you to go with me through these argumen ts is that you begin to see how 
subtle and how really difficult friction is. 

I'm going to pu t an ob ject now on an incline again , as we did be fore and ins tead of having it sit on 
its own I'm go ing to a ttach  to it a s tring .


So here is tha t object and here is the s tring and a pulley and here a s tring .


And here is an object mass m2 , and this objec t has mass m1 and the angle here ... alpha .


I'm look ing for my green chalk .


I want to use the same color conven tion .


Now le t's  look a t all the forces tha t we can  think of.


Here is m1 g .


Let's decompose tha t in y and x d irection.


And I will ca ll this direc tion y, as I always do perpend icular to the surface .


So we ca ll this y and I will call  this direction now the positive x direc tion .


You're free  to choose it any way you wan t to .


The force here is m2 g...


and now comes a major prob lem.


The bigges t problem is tha t you do no t know in advance whe ther th is system will star t to

accelerate in this d irection or whe ther  it will s tart  to accelerate in  this direction or whe ther  it w ill

not accelera te a t all--


it's quite possible .


And all  these three cases, as you w ill see have to be dealt with independen tly.


You canno t do it with one equa tion , as you will see .


Let's first decompose  this force as we did be fore , in the y direc tion .


So th is one equals m1 g cosine alpha and this one , the x component--


which is  in the minus x direction now--


equals m1 g sine alpha .


Clearly, this one--


m1 g cosine a lpha--


we never have to worry abou t.


There is no accelera tion in the y d irection so th is norma l force N will kill this one and this  is m1 g

cosine alpha .


So you never have  to worry abou t the y direction ; we know there's no acceleration.


We on ly deal with forces in the x direction tha t are o f interest.


There is a tension in th is s tring and now comes the problem: I do not know  in wha t direction the

frictional force is .


If th is ob ject has the tendency to go uph ill--


which I don't know yet--


then the frictional force is  in th is d irection because it opposes always the d irection in wh ich the

object wan ts to go.


If, however,  this object wan ts to go in th is d irection--


which I do no t know--


then the frictional force has to be pu t in this direc tion .


And I don' t know tha t.


The only thing I do know is that the maximum value o f the fr iction w ill be mu static times N , wh ich

is wha t we had there .


Remember , tha t's the max imum value  that  the fric tion can have times m1 g cosine a lpha .


That  I know .


So now , if I wan t to deal with th is I have  to look at three comp lete d ifferen t situa tions : accelera tion

in this direction in which the  friction is po inting here; acceleration in this direction in which the

friction is po inting there ; or no acceleration a t all.


There is also , of course , the tension here ...


and this tension is exac tly the same as that tension .


We d iscussed that las t time .


I will not go over that because this is an idea l and, o f course, an unphysical situation.


The pulley has no mass the pu lley  is comple tely fr iction less and the s tring has no mass--


it's a massless s tring .


And I argued last time that therefore the tension here must be  the same as the tension  there .


We even know the tension.


I'm going to evalua te , for now only situations tha t the system is at rest.


It's not ye t moving.


If the system is at rest, T mus t be m2 g because this ob ject is no t being accelerated .


So we already know tha t all situations where the system is a t res t T mus t be m2 g--


that's nonnego tiable.


It's th is T as well as tha t T.


Now I have  to s tart splitting in the following situation .


My first op tion is tha t I make the assumption tha t the system is  just...


just abou t to star t accelerating upwards.


It isn' t do ing it ye t; it is  jus t about  to do tha t.


If that's the case , then I know that the frictiona l force w ill be in th is d irection and it will have

reached the maximum value with the s tatic friction coe fficien t.


Now I can write down , in the x direc tion , New ton's Second Law .


Now I have T, which is  in the positive direc tion minus m1 g s ine alpha minus F f max.


That now has to be zero , just at the momen t tha t it is  just about to change its mind and star t

accelerating.


Now, I know what T is , tha t is, m2 g so m2 g equa ls m1 g sine a lpha plus the maximum fric tiona l

force, which is th is value.


So th is is  just a t the moment that it wants to start sliding.


Therefore, if I make mass m2 a ha ir larger, jus t a ha ir it will go.


And therefore  the momen t that I make this a larger sign I know tha t it's going to accelera te uphill.


That's the criterion  for go ing uphill.


Now I look a t situa tion two .


Now I make the assumption that the object, still s tanding still is just abou t to star t acce lerating

downhill.


Aha ! If  that's the case , I know tha t the maximum force is now poin ting upwards--


the same magnitude, bu t it has now a differen t d irection.


So now I can write down New ton's Second Law .


So the  frictional force is now help ing T.


So now we get T plus F f max minus m1 g sine a lpha equals zero .


We know that  this  is m2 g so m2 g equals m1 g sine alpha minus F f max.


Notice the d ifference : there's a p lus sign here; there's a minus sign here.


This  is... the ob ject is still not moving bu t if I make m2 g a hair  less, just a teeny-weeny  little less it

will definitely s tart  to accelerate downwards.


So if  I make th is "sma ller than" sign  the objec t w ill star t accelerating downhill.


This  is cond ition one,  this  is cond ition two .


If the condition is neither one nor two...


what do you think will happen then? Very possib le tha t you don' t mee t any one of these two

conditions.


What do you th ink will happen?


[class murmurs]


LEW IN : Can't hear you.


[student replies]


LEW IN : It won' t move--


a is zero .


Because th is... bo th cases are going to accelera te so in all o ther cases , the accelera tion equals

zero.


And the frictional force, in th is case will ad just itself jus t the r igh t way so tha t Newton's Second

Law in  the x direc tion will give you, for  the force , a zero .


Let us take a very s imp le example so tha t you see th is at work.


So , we have an example here , and in my example I have m1 equals 1 kilogram, m2 equals 2

kilograms .


Can't make  the numbers much simpler.


I take alpha equals 30 degrees.


I take a s tatic friction coe fficien t which is 0 .5 and I take a kine tic fric tion coefficient which is a little

less, wh ich is 0 .4.


The question is now, is  it going to be accelera ted uphill or accelera ted downh ill or no acceleration

at a ll? Wha t it comes down to is tha t we have to evalua te these three terms.


Let's first  take m2 g--


m2 g equals 20.


We'll just  take, for g , 10--


that is  jus t eas ier.


M1 g sine a lpha ...


The sine of alpha is a half, so tha t is five .


M1 g sine a lpha equa ls five.


And wha t is F  f maximum? I have to use , for my fric tion coefficient, .5 .


I have to use, for m1, one here , a 10, and have the cosine for 30 degrees.


And wha t I find--


you have to  take my word for  it--


that  this  is about 4 .33 , and I want  to remind you  I have used the s ta tic friction coefficien t.


This  is in new tons .


I never pu t a cap ita l N for new tons because that is very confus ing with this normal force .


All my un its are always  in S.I. units so the  force is always in newtons.


Aha ! We are we ll on our way .


Let's first  test whe ther condition one is me t.


Is 20 larger than 5 plus 4.33? And the answer  is yes, it is.


So we know tha t it's going  to be accelerated uphill.


That is nonnegotiable .


So now I could ask you a simple ques tion : Wha t is the acceleration and what is the  tension in  the

string? And so you will think "Oh , we ll, tha t is within arm's reach ." No t quite , because things are

now go ing to change.


If it is going to be accelera ted uphill then a t least I know one th ing which I am going to pu t in th is

drawing now.


I know  that  this  is the max imum fric tion possib le which now becomes mu kinetic--


because it's going to move--


times m1 times g times cosine alpha.


So tha t is a lready one change .


It is moving, so sure , it's going to be accelera ted so the fric tiona l force is in this direction , has this

value.


So le t's write down now New ton's Second Law  in  the x direction .


So we have T in the positive direc tion minus m1 g sine alpha

minus th is maximum force--


minus mu k m1 g cosine alpha--


and tha t, now , accord ing to New ton's Law, must be m1 times a , if a is T acce leration uphill.


One equa tion with two unknowns.


You don' t know a and you don' t know T.


Or do you know T? Wha t is T? What is the tension? What is the tension when that thing is being

accelerated uph ill? Anyone has the courage to try?


[student responds ]


LEW IN : You think "m2 g"--


you couldn't be more wrong.


It's now mov ing, it's being accelera ted .


That means th is ob ject is going to be accelerated down and if  this force is the same as this  it can

never accelera te down .


This T mus t get sma ller .


Remember , an ob ject in an eleva tor being accelerated down loses we ight--


it's losing weigh t.


This object must be accelera ted down .


We have  to take that in to account.


So the  tension , once it star ts acce lerating, will go down .


So I have the second equation for objec t number two .


I call this the p lus d irection, so for objec t number two I have m2 g minus T equals m2 times a .


It is very  important  that you see tha t the tension will change.


Now I have  two equa tions with two unknowns and now  I can solve .


It's very easy--


you jus t add them, and I leave you w ith that.


I'll just give you the resu lts .


I find that  the acceleration , a , equals plus ... I th ink 3 .85 .


That is correct--


plus 3 .85 meters per second squared.


And I find that the tension equals 12.3 new tons .


I want to dwe ll on this a little b it.


I find , for the acceleration, a plus sign .


Had I found a minus s ign,  I would ...


I'm sure I would have made a mis take .


Why is  it manda tory tha t I find a p lus sign? Abso lute ly manda tory! Who wants to  try that one?

Yeah?


[student making explanation]


LEW IN : Yeah , you say ...


you say it well.


I would have said it slightly differently.


We know that  the accelera tion is  in this direc tion .


We der ived tha t.


Therefore the accelera tion since I call  that  the "plus x direction"--


that was my plus sign--


must come out plus .


So if  this comes ou t negative, you've made a mistake.


I a lso want th is number to be less than 20.


If no t, I've made a mis take .


Why does that number have to be less than 20?


[student making explanation]


LEW IN : Exactly--


this objec t is going down. To put it the way we pu t it las t time it los t weigh t, it's accelera ted

downwards.


This N t g, which is 20, be tter w ins it from T; o therwise it would never be accelera ted down .


So th is plus sign is a mus t, and this  is a must.


And if you find no t a plus sign bu t a minus sign you have to go back to your calcula tion because

you've made a mis take.


Now we take  the same situa tion , I leave everyth ing unchanged bu t I make the second mass, m2,

I make it 0 .4 kilograms.


So now all the numbers remain the same that we have  there except that m2 g now becomes 4 .


Now I'm going to tes t again .


This m2 g, wh ich is 4--


is that larger than 5 p lus the fric tional force sta tic, 4 .33? The answer  is no.


I'm going to tes t for my second case.


Is m2 g smaller than 5 minus 4 .33? The answer is no , so wha t do we conclude? Wha t mus t be

our conclusion? Condition one is no t me t, condition two is not met.


The conclusion is a is zero.


The objec t will not be accelera ted and  the fric tiona l force is going to adjust along the x direction

so tha t the acceleration indeed is zero.


How does the frictional  force do tha t? This  is tha t slope , here is that object.


I will only pu t in the forces along the x direc tion .


I don't bo ther abou t the y d irection.


I know  that  there is m1 g s ine alpha , and that one is 5.


So we have here a component of gravity which is the m1 g s ine alpha , and we know tha t tha t is 5 .


We have it there .


I a lso know  that we have tension here and the tension must be m2 g because the objec t is no t

being accelera ted.


We're back where we were.


Number two is no t being accelera ted .


The tension is 20 ...

sorry, no t 20, wha t is my m2? The tension is ... mg is 4.


Five newtons downhill, four newtons uph ill.


What will the fric tion be , how  large , and in what direc tion? Uph ill, how  large? One , exactly .


The friction will ad just itself so that there is equ ilibrium if no thing is go ing .


All righ t,  I now would like to do a few demonstra tions whereby I want you to calcula te the friction 
coefficien ts for me . 

So we're going to put a particu lar object on  that inc line and I'm first going to ra ise the ang le until it 
breaks loose . 

So you should be able to calcu late what the friction coe fficient is using the equa tion tangen t a lpha 
equals mu s.


And the object that  I use for tha t is this... this box.


In this box  is a little weigh t tha t's not very importan t.


It makes the whole  thing 361 grams.


I want you to know that the we igh t o f th is object is 361 grams.


I'll write it down for you here .


So , the mass of  the objec t is 361 ; I'm sure  that  the uncertain ty is a t least 1 gram.


You have to  trust me when I give you the angles.


I'm going to increase the incline and  there comes a momen t tha t it will s tart to slide.


I'll give you the ang le and I wan t you  to ca lcula te tha t friction coefficient.


So we'll do that first...

there we go.


It's now 10 degrees , 11 ...


12Ω, 13 ... 14, 15 ... 16 17... 17Ω , 18, 19 , 19Ω , 20--


20 degrees.


It star ts to s lide at about 20 degrees--


write tha t down .


Now I'm going to do exactly th is experiment: Pu t a rope over it, w ith a pulley, and pu t m2 on th is

side.


And now I'm going  to load down m2 to the po int  tha t it starts to slide uphill.


That shou ld a llow you to also calculate the friction coefficient.


You have all the too ls for it, because once you know that it is  just a t the poin t of breaking and

going uphill you know  that  that equals sign of that equa tion holds and so you should be able to

calculate  the fric tion coe fficient.


Would you find exac tly the same number as you find from this experimen t? No t very  likely .


You have to  think abou t tha t for yourself.


Wood has gra in, and  the grain in th is d irection cou ld be very different  from the grain in th is

direction .


Bu t it would be in teresting to compare the two numbers to see how much they're off.


So I'm going to put here th is rope over here and I'm going to se t the ang le now at a given value

so th is is now no t negotiable .


I se t it at 20 .


I cou ld be o ff by half a degree.


Again, you see, it wants to go .


You jus t saw that--


at 20 degrees, it wants to go .


So I preven t it from going and so I'm going  to put a little weigh t on here.


Now there is 100 grams , and it's not going.


It's happy and it's sitting there .


A is zero .


That cond ition isn't met and th is cond ition isn't met.


So now you mus t write down in your notebook tha t alpha now--


it's an independent exper iment--


equals 20.0 , maybe p lus or minus 1.


I think  it's about 1 degree accuracy tha t I can do .


Okay, I'm going to load here more weight--


more mass , I should say--


at m2 and I' ll give you the numbers and when it breaks  loose, you will see it.


I will give you the numbers .


Now, I have done this many times , believe me and the breaking poin t is no t always at the same

mass.


The mass could differ by 20, 25 grams easily.


So wha tever number we're going to find for m2  I would say you should at leas t allow an

uncertain ty of abou t some thing like 25 grams  just because I've done it many times...


and I know  it could even be worse a t times .


The humidity cou ld change in the room and that could change the fric tion coe fficien t.


Okay, we have 100 grams on it...

we have 200 grams on it...


250... 260 ... 270 , and it goes at 270 .


Did you see it go? It star ted to slide a t 270 .


So at 270 grams, I met exac tly tha t condition .


It was an equals sign .


That shou ld a llow you to calculate the s tatic friction coe fficient and you'll get a chance to do that

in your th ird assignment.


When I had th is thing up here , and when I was  loading this down mak ing it heavier and heavier,  I

hope you realize tha t at first it wan ted to slide in this direction .


So at first the  friction was in  this direction.


As I loaded it down more and more the friction became less and less and less.


There comes even a time that the friction becomes zero.


I loaded more and more and more .


The friction flips over  to the other side.


The friction grows and grows and grows figh ts an hero ic battle to not make it go uphill loses the

battle at one point, reaches the maximum value .


I pu t a little bit more on here and it goes.


So th is frictional force is really having a rough time s tarting o ff in  this direction , slow ly becoming

less becoming zero , changing direc tion , reaching the maximum and finally  losing the battle .


Friction is o ften a pain in the neck, as we a ll know.


Friction causes wear , it causes tear and it costs fuel.


With a car, there's a lo t o f fric tion with the road .


You pay for that, and people  try to reduce friction with bearings and w ith lubrication, oil.


Water  is an amazing lubrican t.


If it s tarts raining and there is a little bit of dus t on  the road the fric tion coe ffic ient be tween your

tires and road can become so low tha t you begin to hydroplane and that you literally ...


[makes whoosh ing sound ]


that your fric tion coe fficien t goes almos t to zero.


It happened to me once, and it's no fun .


It can happen ins tan taneously par ticularly when the rain beg ins--


in the very early part o f the rain when the road is dusty so you get the water with a little bit of dust

mixed .


It's a very dangerous situa tion .


At home , I have a pan--


this  is my pan a t home.


Actually I have more  than one pan a t home , believe me .


Bu t this  is a very special pan and wha t is specia l about  it is some thing that  I d iscovered purely by

accident and I wan t to share with you this remarkab le pan.


You see, when I ro ta te this cover there's a lot o f friction--


you can hear  it.


[me tal lid grating]


And it s tops.


You can hear  it, r ight? And so one evening  I was boiling po tatoes and I was looking at  this pan,

and I wa lked up to it because I wanted to check the potatoes.


And I touched the thing, and there was no fr iction.


It jus t went spinn ing and spinning and sp inning.


I cou ldn't be lieve my eyes until I realized wha t is happening.


Water had accumula ted in the rim of this pan and the cover was beginn ing to hydrop lane .


[me tal lid skimming freely]


I'm pu tting water  in it now.


[me tal lid skimming freely, silently ]


You almost don't hear  it anymore .


Isn't that amazing? Almost fr ictionless.


So now the wa ter acts  like a lubrican t.


And you try  it with your pan, it won't work because you need just the right shape and you need

the r igh t edge to be able  to lubrica te it that way.


There are many experimen ts tha t are done and many a ttemp ts have been made by peop le to

reduce friction.


You try , if you can , to avoid con tact be tween two surfaces.


That you can do by pu tting a lubrican t in between.


Bu t even be tter it would be if you could separate the ob ject comp lete ly and only have a ir in

between because a ir has much less fr iction than a liqu id.


And that's being done w ith grea t success .


Peop le use hovercra fts so they blow air ou t from be low so the craft lifts  itself up and now  it's no

longer  in contac t w ith  the water .


It's above the wa ter , so if it moves now all it has to overcome is the air fric tion and that's  it and 
that he lps tremendous ly. 

You will be seeing in this  lec ture hall many demonstra tions that I will be doing in the fu ture w ith 
what I call an "air track." I will show  it to you in a minute .


It is a long...


call it a bar, for now .


The cross-section is a triangular shape and there are holes in here , and we blow air out o f tha t.


And on top o f tha t are devices wh ich have been specially designed to perfectly fit th is triang le.


And when you star t b lowing the air they are lifted up , so they floa t.


And so now when you g ive them a little tap they can move almost--


not quite, bu t almost--


withou t fric tion .


Here's one ... a lot o f friction.


Now I' ll turn on the a ir.


[air whooshing]


Look a t the difference.


Isn't that amazing?  It's floating on its own air cush ion .


And if I turn it o ff...


[air c licks o ff]


the momen t that the a ir stops, you will see it stops.


So th is is the technique tha t is o ften used to do demonstrations if you have to do them with a

minimum of fr iction.


Of course, you could do experimen ts in the shuttle very well, where you have, aga in, only air

around you .


Bu t tha t's, of course, a very expensive way.


In 26.100, we will use the air track when we s tart colliding objects and try to see what happens

before and a fter the collision .


There is another device , which is very  in triguing and that a lso ac ts on the idea  tha t it lifts  itse lf up

as a resu lt o f gas which is flowing ou t.


In this case, it's a con tainer o f carbon dioxide ...


with carbon dioxide in here, which is solid and there is a sma ll opening here and this  is an

extremely we ll mach ined flat surface, very fla t.


And the whole th ing rests on an ex tremely fla t surface .


Because of  the room  temperature the carbon dioxide w ill s tart  to evaporate and w ill star t to flow

out.


And therefore under this th ing comes a film a very thin layer of carbon dioxide and now you can 
move this around in two dimensions. 

You are not stuck, like you are  there , to one dimension of going back and for th on what we call 
the air track.


Bu t now you can move it around over this who le sur face.


And that allows you to do very  interesting things as I want to show you next.


First make it dark.


FILM NARRATOR : And we've filled tha t can with dry ice that is, solid carbon d ioxide .


Now, you know solid carbon d ioxide is very cold .


This white s tuff is jus t frost  tha t's ga thered on the outside o f the can.


Now, as the can absorbs heat from the room the carbon dioxide evapora tes and turns  into a gas .


The gas takes up more room than the so lid so it has to go somewhere .


It can't come out  the top so it comes out a little ho le here in the bottom o f the disc .


Now, you can' t see it coming out  the hole , but if I make a flame I think you can see tha t there's

gas coming ou t and b lowing  the flame .


Now if we pu t the d isc--


with its stream o f gas coming ou t the bo ttom--


down on our table top which is made o f a very smoo th piece o f pla te glass...


We can wait a momen t while the gas coming ou t builds up pressure undernea th which it has to

do in order to escape .


By now, the d isc is floating on this film o f escaping gas .


That  film is so th in tha t I'm sure you can't see it  from ou t there .


I can scarcely see a space between the disc and the g lass, myself.


Bu t if you'll come and look over my shou lder I th ink I can show you tha t there is a space by

slipping underneath the disc this piece o f tin foil I took off a chewing gum wrapper.


Now, we'll slip the tin foil between the disc and the plate glass top o f the table showing  tha t there 
is indeed a space , a thin film o f gas between the disc and the glass upon which it's resting. 

The purpose of this is simply to reduce the friction to a point where we won' t have to worry about 
it or measure it in our experimen ts today.


It's fun  to p lay w ith  this thing--


let me show you .


I'll give it a little push, jus t a little one .


And there it goes , moving seda tely , no sign o f slowing up.


Come on back.


Same thing in the o ther direction.


It takes only a very tiny force to star t it in motion .


Let me show you tha t.

LEW IN : So you see, fleas are good for some thing.


Have a good weekend.


See you Monday.
