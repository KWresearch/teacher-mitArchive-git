8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 21 

Last lecture, I introduced the concept of angular momentum and  torque.


They're the most difficult concepts in a ll of 8.01.


And only when you get a lot of practice w ill you really get the hang of it.


You shouldn't feel bad if it takes a while.


This is very d ifficult.


I w ill spend the next five lectures exclusively on dealing with these concepts, and

you will see many examp les--


some intuitive, some nonintuitive and some even quite bizarre.


I'd like to briefly review the key things we discussed last time, and you see the

related equations there on the b lackboard.


We have a mass m, and let that mass in your frame of reference have a velocity v.


So then it clearly has a momentum p.


There may be a  force acting upon that mass--


F.


And now I choose a point Q at random.


This is the position vector relative to Q.


Never forget to indicate what the origin is that you have chosen.


Then the definition of angular momentum relative to that point Q equa ls the cross

product of the position vector with p, and that is my equation number one there. 

The d irection is perpendicular to the blackboard, and it w ill be in this case into the

blackboard.


And the magnitude can be calculated provided that you take the angle into account.


You get the sign of theta because of the cross product.


The torque relative to point Q is defined as the position vector, cross F.


In this case, that would be out of the blackboard. 

And, again, the magnitude can be found, but you have to take into account the angle 
between the position vector and the force. 

The torque leads to a change in angular momentum. 

You see that in equation three. 

If there is no torque, then angular momentum won't be changing. 

And if you have a system of objects--

not just one like we have here, but many interacting particles--

then as long as there is no external--

net externa l--

torque on that system as a whole, then angular momentum of the system as a whole

will be conserved.


Today you w ill see various applications of equation four and of equation  five.


Last time, we already discussed the  idea of sp in angular momentum, which is an

intrinsic property of a  rotating ob ject.


We did an experiment with the  ice-skater's delight when I was sacrificing there on

this rotating turntab le.


And we'll see some more examples of that during the next few lectures.


In case that you do have a rotation about an axis through the center of mass--


a stationary axis through the center of mass--


then the angular momentum is intrinsic in the sense that you don't have to specify

the point about which you take the angular momentum.


You can take any point, and you a lways find the same, which  is not true in this

situation.


So that makes the intrinsic angular momentum quite unique.


The reason why it's so nonintuitive--


angular momentum--


is that the angular momentum depends on the point you choose.


And in one problem, you can sometimes pick a point about which the angular

momentum changes, but in the very same problem, you can pick a point about


which angular momentum doesn't change, and both solutions would be perfectly

valid.


So you often have a choice, and that doesn't make  it very intuitive; that doesn't

make it very easy.


So let's start with an example, which I a lso had last time, whereby we have an

object going around the Earth or around the Sun.


Let's take the Earth going around the Sun, and this  is the location of the Sun, and

here is the Earth.


It has a mass m, and it's going around w ith a velocity.


The magnitude doesn't change, but the direction does change.


The position vector relative to point C is r of C, and then we have a gravitationa l

force F, which is pointed towards the center, and the angular velocity omega is in

this direction.


Well, go to equation number one, and the angular momentum relative to point C--


L relative to point C--


the magnitude, because the d irection is clear.


If it's going, seen from where you are, counterclockwise, then the d irection of the

angular momentum w ill be pointing out of the blackboard.


So I'm only interested in the magnitude.


That w ill be r of C times the mass times v.


And the reason why I don't worry about the cross now is because this ang le is 90

degrees, so the sign of theta equals one.


Now, we may not like to leave v in there.


It's up to you.


You can always write v equals omega R, so you can also write, then, m r C squared,

times omega.


Either one is fine.


And this r, if this is the radius of the circle, then this obviously becomes m R squared

omega.


You could have chosen equation  five, and you would immediately have said, "Aha! I

have a rotation about point Q," which in this case is C, and so L... the magnitude of L

of C equa ls the moment of inertia about point C  times omega.


The moment of inertia about point C  for this ob ject is clearly mR squared, and I 
multip ly that by omega, and you see you get exactly the same answer. 

So this is equation one, but this w ill be equation five. 

If I go to equation number two, then equation number two is telling me that if I 
choose point C, but only if I choose point C, that the torque relative to point C is 
zero--

equation number two--

because the force and the position vector make an ang le of 180 degrees with each 
other. 

Whether the object is here or here or here, that makes no difference, and so the 
torque relative to point C is zero, so I also know that the angular momentum is not 
chang ing  relative to point C, but only relative to point C, because any other point 
that you would have chosen here or here or here, there would have been a torque, 
and the angular momentum  would be changing, so there's something very special 
about this point C. 

Angular momentum is only conserved, in this case, about point C. 

Now I take another example whereby angular momentum is only conserved  relative 
to one point but not to any other point. 

I take a ruler or a rod... and the rod has mass M and length l, and C is the center of 
mass of that rod, but I force it to spin about point P...


and this distance is d.


Think of this as a horizonta l frictionless plane, and I'm rotating it with an angular

velocity.


Let's say we rotate it in this d irection, force it about that point P.


I put a p in in there perpendicular to the blackboard and I rotate it.


I'd like to know what the magnitude is of the angular momentum relative to point P,

and for that, I go immediately to equation five, so that tells me that it is the moment 
of inertia about that axis through point P times omega. 

I remember the parallel axis theorem. 

I know that the moment of inertia for rotation about a center of mass through this 
axis perpend icular to the blackboard--

I know that that one equa ls 1/12 M l squared.


But I just looked it up in a table, because I don't remember that.


So that would be the moment of inertia about this axis, and then the parallel axis

theorem tells me I have to add plus Md squared...


times omega.


I'm not interested in the d irection of l, because that's immediately obvious.


If it's rotating clockw ise, then the direction of the angular momentum would be

perpendicular to the blackboard and into the b lackboard.


I cla im that at this point P, there must be a  force acting on this ruler, and the force is 
in this direction. 

And I can make you see that the best way by first show ing you the case of a 
massless rod with two equa l masses at both ends.


And I rotate about this axis perpend icular to the blackboard.


There  is going to be a centripetal force here and a centripetal force here, and the two

are equa l, they cancel each other out, so there will be no force on that pivot point

about which the two rotate. 

However, if I had the situation such that this is my massless rod and here are the 
two equal masses, but now I rotate them about this point, then this centripetal force 
is larger than this one, so now I have asymmetry, and so now there w ill be a force 
on this pin. 

The ruler w ill push on the pin, and action equa ls minus reaction--

the p in will push on the ruler. 

And it is because of this same asymmetry that you have here that there will be a 
force from the pin on point P. 

However, I don't care about that force because I'm going to take the torque relative

to point P.


And when I take a  torque relative to point P, any force through point P has no effect,

because the position vector is zero.


But I want you to appreciate that there is a force, so if I take the torque relative to

point P, I do not worry about this force.


Well, the torque relative to that point P is zero, and so it's clear that angular

momentum relative to point P must be conserved.


Angular momentum relative to point P is conserved.


Take any other point--


it doesn't matter which one you take; take this point Q, take this point here, take

this point here--


and angular momentum is not conserved.


You immed iately see that if I take this point Q here, that this is the position vector,

and you see that r cross F is not zero, so there is a torque relative to point Q.


Angular momentum is not conserved.


Only this point--


that point is very special.


I now take the same ruler, but I'm going to make it rotate about the center of mass.


So here is now the same ruler, and now I'm going to rotate about the center of

mass.


Rotation--


same direction.


I have a stationary axis in 26.100, and it's rotating about there.


Center of mass--


C is my center of mass.


Now there is no  force on this pin because of the symmetry, which I just explained, so

the p in is not pushing on the rod either, so there is no force at all if this is a

frictionless object.


So if there is no  force at all, then the torque relative to any point must be zero--


not only relative to this point, but also relative to this point and relative to this point.


Because if the force is zero, then any cross product of r and F is zero.


So now you see the special case that I alluded to in equation number six.


Now you have the case that the angular momentum of this rotating object is the

same, no matter which point you choose.


We ca ll that the spin angular momentum.


It is an intrinsic property of a spinning object, and it is the same relative to any point

that you choose.


And if you want to know how large  it is, well,  the magnitude of the angular

momentum--


I calculated about C, which is the center of mass--


is simp ly equation number six, is the moment of inertia about that point C, which is

the center of mass,  times omega about the center of mass, so CM--


center of mass--


and C are the same point.


What is the moment of inertia of rotation about the center of mass? That is my 1/12

Ml squared.


So now I have 1/12 Ml squared times omega.


That  is now the intrinsic spin angular momentum, and it is the same for any point

that you choose.


Even if I choose a point here in space, you can prove that it is still the same angular

momentum.


Now we're going to look at other app lications.


There are a huge number of app lications, and in the next four or five lectures, we will

go through many of them.


In some cases, you w ill say, "Yeah, yeah, that's  intuitive; that's obvious." In some

cases, you will say, "Hmm, not so intuitive." And in some cases, you will fa ll off your

cha ir--


it is completely bizarre.


It is so nonintuitive that you don't even believe it.


You won't believe it until I actua lly show you with a demonstration that that's the

way nature works.


But that comes later, not today.


On assignment number seven, I give you a prob lem--


problem 7-9--


in which I have a ruler or a rod on a frictionless horizontal tab le, and the ruler has a

mass l...


a mass M and it has a length l, and here is the center of mass at C.


And I hit that ruler--


I g ive it an impulse--


perpendicular to the direction of the ruler.


Here, I give it an impulse.


A force acts upon  it for a certa in amount of time.


And let this d istance be...


I think I call it "d" in your problem.


And it's on a frictionless table.


I do this--


bang--


very short hit.


And now the question is, what will this ob ject do? What does your instinct tell you?

You will say, "Well,  for sure, it w ill move in this direction." Remember it's frictionless,

so whatever happens after the hit happens forever and ever and ever. 

It will never stop.


So you a ll say, "Well, it's going to move in this d irection." That's very vague, but

that's true.


But how about rotation? Will it rotate? And if it rotates, about which point? Well, you 
may say, "Well, maybe where... the point of rotation may depend on where I hit it." 
That would be a  reasonable intuition, but it's not true. 

It must rotate about the center of mass. 

It cannot rotate about any other point. 

Suppose it rotated about this point, just for sake of argument. 

So after the hit, it's rotated about this point. 

That would mean that the center of mass would  then do this. 

And that's not allowed, because the center of mass behaves like a point in which all

the mass is concentrated.


; F equa ls Ma holds for the center of mass.


And so after the hit, a single point--


because the center of mass can always be considered to be a single point with all the

mass in it.


That point can never do this.


That would be absurd.


So from that reasoning alone, you must conclude that the only way that nature can

digest that impulse is by giving the center of mass a certa in velocity in this direction,

which will never change.


In addition, it will give it an angular velocity about the center of mass.


And if there is no  friction, that will never change.


So a  little later in time, the center of mass w ill still be on this line, and it may have

rotated one or two or three rotations.


That depends... that depends on how large I is and that depends on this distance d,

but let's assume that it is now like so, and then it is happily rotating w ith that

angular velocity, omega C, and continues all the time with that velocity v center of

mass. 

And in that problem, I'm asking you to calculate the velocity of the center of mass

and to calculate the angular velocity about the center of mass.


I'll help you a little bit, and I hope that PIVoT w ill help you a little more.


For the center of mass, what must always hold...


The center of mass acts like a point source, so it must a lways hold that F equa ls Ma

of the center of mass.


That  is really one of the major characteristics of the center of mass.


So if we look at magnitude--


F delta t equa ls M times a center of mass delta T--


the force acts for a certa in amount of time, and  that's the impulse.


But if--


before I hit--


if this velocity is zero, then a delta t is obviously the velocity of the center of mass

afterwards.


v equa ls at, right, and v was zero to start with.


So you see now immediately that I--


that is the impulse--


equa ls M times the velocity of the center of mass, and so  the velocity of the center of

mass equals I divided by M.


And so I have solved for you the first part of that problem.


And what is remarkab le--


that it's independent of b...


or d, sorry.


We ca lled that d.


It's completely independent of d.


Whether you hit here with the very same  impulse or hit there makes no difference.


The center of mass behaves like a point source--


F equals Ma--


and the velocity of the center of mass only depends on I and on the mass of the

object.


The larger I, the larger the velocity.


That's, of course, quite intuitive.


And the larger the mass,  the lower the velocity.


But now comes the hardest part, and I w ill leave you largely w ith that hardest part

but g ive you a few clues, because now I want you to ca lculate omega about the

center of mass.


And now you have to choose an origin, because you're dealing w ith torques, you're

dealing with changing angular momentum, and so you would probab ly choose C as

your orig in.


And you w ill say, "Okay, let's think about what the angular momentum is "relative to

point C before the collision, after the collision--


"if you call it a collision.


What is the torque relative to point C?" Well, the torque relative to point C, there is

here the position vector r of C, and the torque is r cross F, and this F acts for a

certain amount of time, so this certa inly is not zero.


You can clearly see that there is a torque relative to point C, and if there is a torque

relative to point C, the angular momentum relative to point C must be chang ing.


Yeah, you bet your life  it's changing, because the angular momentum  before the hit

is zero, but after the hit, the angular momentum is I about the center of mass times

omega, center of mass.


You can see that if it rotates about the center of mass, it has an angular momentum

of rotation about the center of mass which is I omega.


Before, it was zero; afterwards, it's this.


So clearly there must be a torque about the center of mass.


And so now, all you would have to do is to somehow relate that change in angular

momentum with this distance d and with I.


And you w ill see that if d becomes larger, that indeed the omega of center of mass--


the angular velocity of our center of mass--


will increase.


It's very sensitive.


That's also  intuitive because  if you hit right in the midd le, you d idn't expect it to

rotate at a ll.


You would just expect this object to translate.


And so clearly, the velocity of the center of mass is  insensitive of where you hit, but

the angular velocity around the center of mass is very sensitive, as I will show you

shortly.


If you hit here, you don't expect any rotation.


Some of you may say, "I don't like to take C as my orig in.


"I'm going to pick another point as my origin.


"I'm going to take this point P as my origin or any other point on this line." Angular

momentum must be conserved about that point, because there is no torque relative

to that point.


Because any position vector from this point to here is in the same d irection as the

force, so r cross F is zero.


So now we have a point--


an infinite number of points--


all these points here on this line, the torque is zero.


So the torque relative to point P  is zero, so  there is angular momentum L relative to

point P is conserved.


It is zero before, and so it's zero after the hit.


Isn't that interesting? And you can solve that problem and find exactly the same

answer for the angular velocity about the center of mass by choosing point P.


It's just a matter of taste.


Most of you would probab ly p ick C, but if you p ick point P, the prob lem may even be

a little easier.


Both should work, and I will make sure that the solutions to both will appear on the

fina l solutions.


So you w ill see that it can be done in two different ways.


I have here a  ruler with a...


which I can hit.


Here's this ruler.


This is the center of mass, and this is just a reference  line.


What I will try is to hit it in a direction parallel to the reference line.


If I succeed, then it may start to rotate, but the center of mass should stay on that

line, depending upon where I hit.


However, if I don't hit it exactly parallel to this line, it will not stay on this line--


the center of mass--


so don't start laughing then.


It simp ly means that my angle is not perfectly in this direction.


If I hit like this, then obviously it w ill go in this d irection.


So I will try to hit it first a long the d irection of this  line.


I w ill hit  it right in the middle, so I expect no rotation.


I only expect that the center of mass w ill move.


Now, there is lots of friction here, so the thing w ill come to a grind ing ha lt.


It will not go on forever and ever.


So let's try this.


And you see that's fantastic.


It moved, it translates, stays on the line, but it hard ly rotates at all because I hit it

very close to the center of mass.


Now I'm going to hit here, far below the center of mass, so now I expect this point to

stay on the line if I'm lucky enough that I hit it in the right direction, and then, of

course, it will start to rotate like this.


And it will come to a ha lt because of the friction.


So let's try that.


Not bad.


You see it stays very close to the center, to that line.


That means my hit was a lmost perfectly in this direction, and you saw it rotate.


I'll do  it once more.


Oh, look at that.


It goes much farther.


It rotated over a much larger ang le.


The center of mass indeed is very close to this line, so I was lucky, and my direction

in which I hit  it was quite close to being parallel to that b lack line.


Now comes another application of the... use of torques.


And that has to do w ith simple harmonic oscillations.


We were able to calculate the period of oscillation of a pendulum.


That was relatively easy.


Most of you have even learned how to do that in high school--


a string, no mass, an ob ject at the end, and you give it a kick, and it goes simple

harmonic  if the ang le is not too large.


But now suppose you have a  ruler like this, and you have here a little p inhole, and

you're going to oscillate it  like this.


What now is the period of oscillation? That looks like a mathematical headache.


And yet, w ith the knowledge that we have now,  this can be solved quite easily, and

we can make a quite accurate pred iction about the period of oscillation of this rather

complex system.


Even a system as b izarre as this hula hoop, which oscillates about that pin, can now

be ca lculated very easily w ith the knowledge that we have, or at least that you will

have very shortly if you spend the time and you study this.


So let's first do  the...


We first take the ruler.


This is a ruler.


The ruler has mass M and length l.


This is the center of mass of the ruler, and I make...


I force it to rotate about point P, put a pin through there, nearly frictionless, and the

separation between the center of mass and P, I call that now "b", as in "bridge."

This ang le is theta.


It rotates about the pin perpendicular to the blackboard.


For sure,  there will be forces through that point P. 

I don't care about that because now  I'm not going to negotiate with you about which 
point I'm going to take the torque. 

I w ill insist on taking torques exclusively through that point P, so that I get rid of any 
forces that go through that p in--


any forces that the p in exerts on the ob ject.


Gone--


don't care about it.


All I worry about now is this Mg and this position vector rP.


That determines the torque.


And the magnitude of that torque--


and I'm sure that torque is going to change in time--


equa ls Mg times this distance b, but I have to take the sine of this angle theta

because remember, it is a cross product between r and F.


And the cross product has the sine of the angle in it.


So the magnitude of that is going to be Mg times b times the sine of theta.


This is r cross F--


the magnitude of r cross F--


this being F, this being r.


I go to equation number four, and  I say, aha, that must be equa l to the moment of

inertia about point P--


about the axis through the perpend icular to the blackboard through point P--


times alpha, which is the angular acceleration, and, of course, this may change with

time and theta will change w ith time.


However, there is one important thing.


This torque  is a restoring torque.


It wants to drive it back to equilibrium.


And therefore, we need a minus sign here for the very same reason that when we

did the spring that the force was minus kX and not plus kX.


Now I say, aha, small angle approximation.


By the way, alpha equa ls omega dot--


first derivative of the angular velocity.


Therefore, it a lso equals theta double dot.


I a lso wrote that there.


And theta  is this angle.


This is the change of this ang le that you see there--


the second derivative.


I say, aha, small angle approximation, then the sine of theta is theta--


we've done that before, provided the ang le is in radians.


And so I'm going to get that Mg b theta plus I relative to P times theta doub le dot

equa ls zero.


And now I already begin to  feel it in my bloodstream.


I a lready beg in to smell the simp le harmonic oscillation, and you, too.


Let's bring  the theta double dot naked out here plus Mg b d ivided by I of P times

theta equals zero, and this,  for sure, is a simple harmonic oscillation in theta.


And the solution must be that theta in time must be some maximum angle times the

cosine of omega t plus phi.


This omega has nothing to do with that omega.


This is angular velocity, and this is angular frequency.


This will never change.


That's related to the period of oscillation.


This is changing a ll the time.


d theta/dt is changing a ll the time.


When the object is here, d theta/dt has the largest va lue.


When the object stands still, d theta/dt is zero.


So the angular velocity is changing with time, but this omega is a constant, and it is

very awkward in physics that we use the same symbol in one problem and have

tota lly d ifferent meaning. 

In any case, we know that this omega, the angular frequency equals the square root

of Mg b...


divided by I of P, and so the period of an oscillation, which is 2pi divided by omega

has to be this.


This, by the way, is independent of the mass of the object.


You may say, "Yeah, but there is a mass downstairs." Yeah, yeah, but there is a lso a

mass upstairs, because the moment of inertia about point P has a mass in it.


The moment of inertia about point P we find immed iately by using the para llel axis

theorem.


If it were rotating about the center of mass, about this axis, then it would be 1/12 Ml

squared, and so we have to add Mb squared.


We did something similar there.


So this is 1/12 Ml squared p lus M times b squared--


parallel axis theorem--


and so now we find that the period is 2pi times the square root of...


I lose my M, so I get 1/12 l squared plus b squared, and I get here gb.


And that is a very simple result when you come to think of it.


I mean, this would have been a comp lete headache to do it in any other way.


And this always baffles me so much.


Some people... some of you think that physics is d ifficult, but I always think of it the

other way around.


I a lways think of that...


physics is there to make very d ifficult things easy.


Look at  it.


This is an incredib ly comp lex system that  is going to rotate about a pin, which is

offset from the center, and here is a very stra ightforward prediction about the

period. 

In our case, a b equa ls 40 centimeters, and it is an exact meter stick.


So l equals 1.00, and b equals, oh, it's about 40 centimeters, but we could be off by

something like maybe two millimeters.


It's not so easy to get that whole in precisely.


So it's 40 centimeters plus or minus 0.2 centimeters.


So that is an uncertainty of about half a percent.


I have upsta irs l square and b square and downsta irs b, and that makes the error

analysis a bit complicated.


If I stick in the numbers, then I find a period which w ill be very close to 1.565 
seconds. 

That's taking the exact numbers that I gave you for l, and I take for g 9.8, and I take 
the values for b.


Since I prefer to be on the conservative side, I will allow  for an uncertainty of about

0.01 seconds, and I would like to make a measurement and show you...


yeah, and show you what we get.


So we have here the ruler.


We're going to oscillate it...


sma ll ang le.


Well, we can be a little bit rougher, make it a little larger.


Let's stop it first, and I will start it when it stops at my side.


That  is always the easiest to do.


Now--


one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.


Look--


on the button, way within the error.


Amazing, isn't it, that such complex systems can be so easily dealt w ith in physics?

It is 15... what is it--

.71, and my reaction time is always .1 second, so the agreement is absolutely 
fantastic. 

Now I w ill show you, once you have done this with your ruler, you can now app ly this 
know ledge on a way more interesting system, and that is the, um... the hoop.


We'll take the hula hoop, and we're going to do the same thing for the hula hoop.


And the system, the approach, will be exactly identical.


We have a pin through the hula hoop.


This is the hula hoop, this is point P, this is the center of mass--


I call it "C".


It's now like this.


A little later, the center of mass will be here, and this angle w ill be theta.


The mass of the hula hoop is M, and it has a  rad ius R.


I know there w ill be forces through that point P, but I couldn't care less about them.


All I worry about  is this Mg and this position vector rP.


And the whole thing goes parallel.


I'm going to get that the torque about that point P equals Mg...


and I'll fill in for this immed iately the radius R...


times the sine of theta.


And that must be equal minus the moment of inertia about point P times theta

double dot.


What is the moment of inertia about point P? Well, it is the moment of inertia of

rotation about the center of mass p lus MR squared--


that's the parallel axis theorem--


and the moment of inertia for rotation about this axis is clearly MR squared, because

all the mass is d istributed at the circumference at distance R, so it is the summation

of all the masses times the radius squared.


So this is going to be MR squared p lus MR squared, so that  is 2MR squared.


So we bring  this to one side, so we're going to get theta doub le dot p lus MgR.


We make this theta--


sma ll ang le approximation--


divided by IP equals zero.


Simp le harmonic oscillation in theta with exactly that same solution, but now we get

as a period, we get 2pi times the square root of IP d ivided by MgR.


But IP is 2MR squared.


You see IP d ivided by Mg, not b, but now we have MgR...


divided by MgR, and that is 2pi times the square root of 2R/g. 

And that is a cute result, because if I had a pendulum and the pendulum had a 
length l which is 2R and I put a ll the mass at the end of the pendulum and the string 
has no mass, I would have found exactly the same result. 

Remember, the period of a pendulum is 2pi times the square root of l/g.


Notice aga in there is no mass in there.


It's only a matter of geometry.


Geometry is the only thing that determines the period of oscillation.


That's always the case.


With a pendulum--


a simp le pendulum--


with a mass at the end is a lso the period is  independent of the mass, not with

springs, but a lways with gravity.


So the first thing I want to show you is that if I have here an apple on a string, and

to the center of the apple is about the same to here, to this p in, is about the same

distance as the diameter of the...


of the hula hoop, that they probably have very closely the same period.


You see, they track each other quite well; not precisely, because I was not able to

get the  length exactly right, but very closely.


So a lready you see that indeed that result makes sense, but now I want to go one

step further.


I want to do a quantitative measurement because I know the rad ius of this hula

hoop.


The rad ius, I think, is 40 centimeters, and we know that to an accuracy of about half

a centimeter.


So R is 40.0 plus or minus 0.5 centimeters.


You will say, "Boy, can you not measure that any better? "I mean, ha lf a centimeter-

-


it's a lmost yea big, ha lf a centimeter." Well, the reason is, it's not a perfect circle.


So if you measure the diameter at various p laces, you don't a lways get the same,

and so that's why I a llow for half a centimeter uncerta inty. 

So that's a one percent uncertainty in R, one percent. 

Under the square root, that becomes ha lf a percent. 

And so the prediction then would be, if I put in the numbers here that we have... 

is 1.795, and that would become ha lf a percent uncerta inty, half of 1.79  is about 
one, so let's make it easy--

.01 seconds. 

That  is my pred iction, and I'm going to make ten oscillations, which gives me an 
uncerta inty of 0.1 seconds in ten oscillations, so that gives me an uncerta inty of .01 
in one oscillation. 

Imagine that you come home at Thanksgiving, and you show this to your parents, 
and you say, "Oh, by the way, Dad and Mom, would you be able to calculate the 
period of this oscillation?"  I mean, they would turn pale, green, purp le, and you take 
out your pocket, and you just do it like that--

simple. 

And not only that, but you can do a demonstration. 

You can show it to them. 

They'll be proud of you. 

[students laugh] 

Okay, let's try it. 

There we go. 

Small angle--

this is about five degrees, seven degrees. 

It doesn't make that much difference as  long as you don't get much above ten. 

I don't like the w iggle. 

I'll start it when it stops here. 

Now! One, two, three,  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 

Holy smoke! Look at that. 

18.07... 18.07. 

If I divide that by ten, then I get 1.807. 

Let's call it one plus or minus 0.01. 

And if you take this error into account and this... 

well, you can make that a 07... 

pretty impressive.


We have five minutes left, and I want to use these five minutes...


First, I'm going to ask your forg iveness for what I'm going to do the next five

minutes because by now, you may be lost already and I'm going to make it a little

worse by challenging you a little.


And this cha llenge makes life really interesting.


If I spin an ob ject--


a top--

then clearly, there w ill a lways be external friction on that top, and the top w ill come 
to a ha lt. 

It's obvious.


We've a ll seen it.


You turn a top, you wait a while, and it stops.


And if it doesn't stop like it didn't when I gave the exam review, then something

stinks.


Then you're being cheated, and you were cheated.


There was something going on in that little black box which kept it going, of course.


It can't keep going forever.


So whenever you sp in something in the laboratory here, different from outer space,

there are a lways external frictional torques on it and it w ill come to a halt.


It is inconceivab le that all by itself it would come to a halt and then turn the other

way around.


That would be absurd.


It couldn't possibly happen because the moment it comes to a stop, all the external

torques go away, so  it will just sit there.


Imagine that you slide an ob ject on the tab le--


whoosh--


a plate, and  it comes to a stop because of friction and then it comes back at you--


it would be equally absurd, right? Unless you attached a spring to it, of course.


There are no other external forces on it.


You shove it on the table,  friction takes out the kinetic energy, it comes to a ha lt,

and it sits there.


It couldn't possibly come back at you--


would be a violation of basic laws of physics.


So if you rotate...


if you sp in a top, then it has to come to a ha lt, and it couldn't possibly rotate, come

to a ha lt and  reverse its direction of rotation.


And as long as we agree to that, then you w ill pass this course.


Now, you a lready smell a  rat, don't you? You a lready smell a rat.


Okay, I have here a piece of plastic, a nice piece of p lastic.


You can come and examine it.


And this plastic behaves quite nicely.


I w ill g ive it a spin.


Friction, external torque, friction w ill bring it to a halt, and it stops.


No prob lem, right? Inconceivable that after the stop, it would reverse the direction of

motion, which it d id just now.


You may not believe your eyes.


In fact, when I saw this first, I did not believe my eyes.


When I saw it again, I felt sick in the stomach and couldn't sleep all night.


I mean, look at this.


I'm rotating it, it comes to a ha lt.


Friction brings it to a halt, and it reverses direction.


Don't have sleep less nights about  it, but g ive it some thought.


Is this a complete violation of the conservation of angular momentum of some kind?

Think about it, and see you on Wednesday.
