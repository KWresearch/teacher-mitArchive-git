8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 31 

So far , we analyzed...


We calcu lated the periods o f lots of oscillators: pendulums, springs , rulers, hula hoops .


We gave  them a kick, moved them off equilibrium, and then they were oscillating at their own

preferred frequency.


Today,  I want to discuss with you wha t happens  if I force upon a system a  frequency of my own .


So we ca ll tha t forced oscillations.


I can take a spring system, as we have before.


This  is x equals zero, this  is x, and we have the spring force, very familiar, minus kx.


Bu t now this objec t here, which is mass m, I'm going to add a force to it, F zero , which is the

amplitude o f the  force, times the cos ine of omega t.


So I'm going to force it in a sinusoidal fashion w ith a frequency that I choose .


This frequency is not  the frequency with which the system wants to oscilla te.


It is the one  that  I choose, and I can vary that.


And the question, now , is what will the objec t do? Well, we have Newton's Second Law--


ma equals minus kx plus that force, F zero cosine omega t.


a is x double dot, so I get x double do t, plus-- I bring  this in--


k over m times x equals F zero divided by m times the cosine omega  t.


Now, the ques tion is wha t is the so lution to  this differen tial equation? It's very d ifferen t from what

we saw before, because be fore , we had a zero here.


Now we have here a driving force .


It's clear tha t if you wait long enough tha t sooner or  la ter tha t system will have to star t oscilla ting

at tha t frequency.


In the beg inning, it may be a little different.


In the beg inning, it may want  to do its own thing, bu t ultima tely , if I take you by your arms and I

shake you back and forth, in the beginn ing you may object, bu t sooner or  la ter, you will have to

go with the  frequency that I force myself upon you . 

And when we reach tha t stage , we ca ll tha t the steady state as opposed to the beginning , when

things are a little bit confused, which we call the transient phase.


So in the steady s ta te, the object somehow must have a frequency which is the same as the

driver, and it has some amplitude A.


And I wan t to evaluate with you tha t amp litude A.


So th is is my trial func tion  that  I'm going to pu t into this differen tial equa tion.


x dot equals minus A omega sine omega t.


x double do t equa ls minus A omega squared cosine omega t.


And so now I'm go ing to substitu te that in here , so  I'm going to ge t minus A omega squared

cosine omega  t p lus k over m times A cosine omega t, and tha t equals F zero d ivided by m times

the cos ine of omega t.


And that must always hold .


So there fore I can divide out my cosine omega t.


I can bring the A's together, so I get A times k over m minus omega squared equals F zero

divided by m.


Now, this k over m is something that we are familiar w ith.


If we le t the system do its own thing--


we bring it away from equilibrium and we don't drive it--


then we know tha t omega squared, wh ich I w ill give the zero, equa ls k over m.


This  is the frequency that we have dea lt with before .


This  is the driving frequency--


it's very differen t.


And so I'm go ing to subs titu te in here for k over m omega zero squared , and so I  find , then , tha t

the amplitude of  this objec t here a t the end o f the spring will be F zero divided by m d ivided by 
omega zero squared minus omega squared . 

And th is amplitude has very remarkab le characteris tics.


First of all, if I dr ive the system a t a very  low frequency so tha t omega is much , much smaller than

omega zero , we call omega zero often the natural frequency.


It is the one  that it likes.


If you have omega much , much less than omega zero , this goes--


omega zero squared is k over m--


so you get an amplitude A which is F zero divided by k.


If you go omega way above the na tural frequency or , le t's say, omega goes to infinity--


it becomes very, very  large--


then downs tairs becomes very, very large, so A goes to zero.


Bu t now, wha t happens when omega is exactly omega zero? Then the system goes wacky.


Look wha t happens.


The downstairs becomes zero and the amplitude goes to infinity.


And that's wha t we call resonance.


So if we drive it a t tha t frequency, the system goes complete ly berserk .


I can make a p lot o f A as a function of frequency.


When I say "omega ," you can obvious ly always change to her tz, if you pre fer tha t, because

omega is two pi  times F, so you can do it e ither in her tz or you can do it in radians per second , of

course.


So if  I make a p lot o f the amplitude versus frequency omega , then a t low va lues-- I have here F

zero divided by k--


is the amplitude.


When I hit the resonan t frequency, the na tural frequency of the system, it goes ou t o f hand , it

goes to infinity .


The momen t tha t omega is larger than omega zero, no tice that the amp litude becomes negative.


A nega tive amplitude simply means that you ge t a ll of a sudden a phase change o f 180 degrees,

so the ob ject is 180 degrees ou t o f phase with the driver.


I will not expand on tha t too much today , but it is negative, and so it comes up here, and  then it

goes here to zero for very h igh frequencies of omega .


So some thing very spectacu lar  is go ing to happen at the resonan t frequency o f the system.


In practice , of course, the amp litude will no t go to in finity, and the reason for that is tha t there is

always friction o f some kind .


There is always damping, bu t you get a very high amplitude bu t no t in finitely high.


So if  I make you a more realis tic plo t o f the amplitude, and I w ill take now  the absolu te value , the

magnitude, so we don't have to worry abou t it ge tting negative--


we don' t have to worry about  the 180-degree phase shift--


then you would ge t a curve tha t looks  like th is.


And here , then , if this  is frequency F, then here you would get the na tura l frequency when things

go ou t of hand .


And depending upon how much damping  there is, this curve would look either very narrow and 
very spiky--

it goes very , very high , then there is very  little damp ing--

or if  there is a lo t of damping in the system, it's more like th is. 

So the narrower this... 

We call this the resonance curve .


The narrower tha t is, the less damping there is.


I have here a system on the air track which is an ob ject tha t I can drive with a frequency tha t I can

choose.


Here is a spring...


object mass m, and here is ano ther spring.


It's fixed on  this s ide, righ t there, and here I'm going to drive it, so I have here this variab le force

that you see there.


And wha t I want  to show you now  is tha t firs t I will drive it a t a  frequency which is way be low the

resonant frequency.


Then you w ill see an amp litude , not very large.


I will then dr ive it way above the resonan t frequency.


Again, you will see an amplitude which is very low .


If I can go very high frequency , you will see tha t it almost stands s till, and then I will  try to h it the

resonant frequency, and that will be...


It's abou t one hertz , the resonan t frequency, if I jus t let  this objec t do its own thing, jus t this .


Now you see the na tural frequency--


it's about one her tz--


but now I'm going to drive it here w ith a system, and we are going to pull on th is spring with a

frequency tha t we control.


So le t me star t.


You see here the frequency.


You see an indica tor, very  low, way  lower than one hertz.


And when you look at  the way tha t the system responds, if you wa it long enough when the

transien ts are died out, you will see tha t they go hand in hand , tha t the ampl itude is in phase with

the driver.


That's why we have p lus amplitude here.


Bu t the phase is not so important today.


See , they go hand in hand .


Very small amplitude, rough ly a t zero div ided by k , wh ich is the spring constant o f the spring .


Now I' ll go way above resonance, and  this system will s lip here, so don't pay atten tion to the

arrow anymore.


Way above resonance.


You see, it s tarts to slip.


Look a t the amplitude--


very modest, very small.


Bu t we wen t over this curve, so first we probed it here and now we're prob ing it here .


Look, it's almost no t moving at all, almost standing still, and I'm driving it at a high  frequency now .


And now I'm going  to find you this resonance, which is near one her tz...


which is somewhere here .


And look-- very high amplitude.


If we're not care ful, then we can actua lly break the system.


Very h igh amplitude--


I'm trying to scan over  it now, go a little b it off resonance.


Now I'm back on resonance.


See wha t a huge amp litude ! Be tter turn it off.


So you see here  the response when I drive a system.


When my system is a little b it more complicated--


for instance , if I had two masses here so I would add one here , spr ing constan t k, spring constan t

k--


I cou ld repeat  this experimen t, and if I did tha t, I would find two resonan t frequencies.


And if I do it with three objects,


I would find three resonan t frequencies .


If I did it with five , I would find five resonan t frequencies .


And when I make,  then , this curve o f A amplitude as a function o f frequency--


either her tz or  in radians per second , wh ichever you prefer--


then if  I had three objects there in a row, you would see some thing like this .


And depending upon how many of  these objec ts you have, you ge t more and more resonances .


And these resonances can all be  found by driving the system and searching  for them.


If I go to a system whereby I have an infinite number o f these masses...


We call them coupled oscillators ; these oscillators are coupled through the springs.


An in finite number of coupled oscilla tors wou ld be a vio lin s tring .


Here's a v iolin string.


And the reason why I call it " infinitely" number o f oscilla tors is that I can th ink o f each atom or

each molecule as being dr iven, as being connected by springs to the neighbor.


And so it's an infinite number o f coupled oscillators.


And so when I star t to shake this system, I wou ld expect a lo t o f resonances , and tha t's wha t I

want to explore with you now .


In the case here, that  the objec ts move in the same direction of  the spring ...


I call this the y direction and I call this the x d irection, so the spring is in  the x direc tion , the

objects , the bea ts are in the x direc tion , and the oscillations are in the x direc tion .


We call those long itudinal oscillations.


There is also a way tha t you can have  transverse oscillations , transverse...


whereby the mo tion is  in the y direc tion , whereas the beats are in the x direc tion .


I cou ld even do tha t w ith this system--


I cou ld make them oscillate like this , because the springs will obviously a lso work if I do this with

the sys tem.


And that's the way I wan t this violin s tring or piano string to oscillate now, because that's the on ly

meaningful way tha t I can make it oscillate .


And so I wonder--


if I'm going to drive it here by shaking it up and down , searching for the resonant frequencies--


what I will be seeing.


If I go with very  low frequencies , the string laughs at me, the string does noth ing.


It's  just bored , doesn' t respond to me.


I am somewhere here in the resonance curve .


Bu t then when  I increase the frequency slow ly, I hit the very first  frequency at which it likes to

oscillate.


I call tha t f1 .


And when I look a t the string, and you will see that shor tly, the s tring will oscilla te like so .


It will go up here , and it will go down here.


And all it w ill do is this .


[makes swishing sounds]


That's  its first resonance .


And I call  this n equals one , o ften ca lled the first harmonic.


And then I go to higher frequencies, and it will not do very much .


It's very unhappy.


And then all of a sudden , I hit a second resonance .


I call tha t f2 .


And the second resonance w ill show up like this .


This poin t o f the str ing will no t move a t a ll.


When this par t is up , this par t will be down .


I call tha t s ... n equals two .


And it oscillates like so .


[makes swishing sounds]


And th is po int wh ich is no t moving a t all, we call tha t a node.


I go a little bit beyond tha t second resonance, and no thing happens-- the string will be quite

unhappy, sort o f flu tters a little bit un til  I h it ano ther resonance, f3, and then is the next resonance .


I will see two nodes appear, one here and one here , and the s tring will oscillate like so .


This goes up and down, 180 degrees ou t of phase , and these  two ends are in phase.


This  is n equa ls three .


And I can go on like tha t and add nodes , and I will show you some o f tha t very shortly .


The frequency that  I generate--


I call tha t f of n , n is an integer;

it could be one , two , three or four-- is linear  in f1 .


In o ther words , if f1 were 100 her tz, then f2 would be 200 her tz and f3 would be 300 her tz.


We call n equals one-- we call  that  the firs t harmonic.


Some books a lso call it the fundamen tal.


I will call it  the firs t harmonic.


And we call n equals two the second harmonic.


And so on-- n equa ls three is the th ird harmonic.


So we're going to get a ser ies o f discrete frequencies which were equally spaced.


f1 depends on the length o f the str ing, on  the tension--


I will write "tension" ; don't con fuse this with period--


and it depends on the mass of the s tring .


Without going into the detail how the dependence is , these are the parame ters tha t determine the

first harmonic .


I have here a very special violin string or piano s tring , whatever you want  to ca ll this .


And we can genera te these resonan t frequencies by searching for them, and I would need

assistance from a studen t.


Would you be w illing to help me? So, you hold one end of the piano string in your hand.


Don't le t it go, please, don' t le t it go.


I promise you I won' t let it go e ither.


Okay, so  I pu t a cer tain  tension on it, and I start to shake at a very low frequency.


Look how  low , and look how happy th is s tring is-- no thing.


It jus t laughs at me, ignores me, it doesn't like me .


Now I'm going to increase the frequency .


And now I'm hitting the first resonance-- it's coming up.


There it is, and tha t's exac tly the shape that you see on the blackboard-- very clear.


I shake it here.


I have exac tly the resonance a t one.


Let me now  try to h it the second harmon ic.


If I go up a little over the f1 , then no thing much happens.


It's hard for me to see.


Is this... is this the second harmonic , or  is this already the third?


[chuckling ]:  It's already the third .


Let me see whe ther I can get the second.


I think I go t it now ; do I?


Okay, so here you see the second harmonic .


You see, indeed , tha t node , tha t poin t s tanding s till, and the amp litude is enormous.


That's a characteris tic for a resonan t frequency .


We call it also a norma l mode  frequency or a na tural frequency.


It's all the same th ing .


Let me now  try to generate one tha t is very h igh , as high as I possibly can, and you te ll me wh ich

harmon ic it is.


All you have to do is count how many nodes there are , not counting my hand and his hand, and

you add one , and tha t is the harmonic that I generate .


The system is not  too happy .


You see, you feel it sort o f when it comes...


[yells ].


No, no, no , no, no .


See , now I'm o ff resonance.


It's very hard for me to hit resonance, bu t I will ge t it.


There it comes, there it comes, there's no ques tion now ! I got it, I'm on resonance now ! Look a t it!

Clearly I'm on resonance! So, how many d id you count? STUDENT: Six.


LEW IN : Six harmonic? Looked 12 to me , but okay, you count be tter than I can .


Okay, thank you very much.


So , you see here how the system responds to a driver, and a complica ted system like a s tring

has many, many o f these resonant frequencies , which we call the normal modes.


Now, when you have a vio lin , you have four s trings .


They a ll have the same leng th.


There are musical ins trumen ts like a piano, whereby the length is differen t.


Violin-- four strings , all the same leng th .


You can se t the tension so you have some thing  to play with .


The tension is changed, normally, when you tune the instrument be fore you s tart playing, bu t

these four strings a ll have a differen t mass, and  that gives them a very different  frequency .


Now, if you play the vio lin , you cannot change  the tension, of course, during the play ing.


That wou ld be a little difficult, although there are instrumen ts tha t exis t where actua lly the playing

depends on the tension of  the string .


With the v iolin , tha t's not the case , so with the vio lin , the only op tion you have while you are

playing it is to make the string leng th shorter , and you do that by moving your finger along the

string.


By making it shorter , the frequency goes up, and by making it longer , the frequency goes down. 

Now, how do you excite a musica l instrumen t like a piano string or a violin s tring? There is 
nothing tha t is driving it exactly a t tha t resonant  frequency, so if you wan t to get a 440 her tz ou t of 
a violin s tring , then you are not driving it exactly a t the 440 her tz, like we are doing . 

Well, tha t's true, bu t if you take a bow and you rub the string with a bow , then in a way wha t 
you're doing is you're exposing  tha t s tring to a lo t o f possible frequencies, no t just one .


Bu t it is a rubb ing action.


I cou ld a lso rub it with my finger, or I could pluck  it, or I could kick  it, and wha t it does  is it ignores

all the frequencies which are not a t resonance, bu t it picks out the ones which are a t resonance.


So striking it with a bow  is effectively exposing it to a whole large spectrum of frequencies , and it 
picks out  the ones tha t it likes . 

In fact, if you strike a violin s tring with a bow , you may excite it simultaneous ly in  the firs t 
harmon ic and in  the second, and even in  the third harmonic, or even h igher harmonics.


And that makes the difference be tween the various  instrumen ts.


That gives  it the special  tone quality .


Depends upon the cockta il, the combina tion o f the various harmonics tha t you excite .


Now, if you go to woodwind ins truments , then the situa tion is quite different.


I have here a sound cavity.


It's a box tha t has  length l, and there is air  inside here .


And I wan t to see whether this system has resonant frequencies.


So I pu t in here a little loudspeaker to genera te sound with different frequencies and search for

resonances, and there are .


The resonances o f th is system, however, are different from the string in tha t sense.


It's not  the box tha t w ill resona te here, bu t it is the air  itself tha t s tarts to resonate .


Air acts  like a spring.


In fact, in that sense, it is very paralle l to our spr ing sys tem.


It is also a longitudinal oscilla tion , whereas that is a transverse oscilla tion .


So you make pressure waves inside , and if you do tha t at the righ t frequency, the air acts  like a

spring and then you get strong reactions, which are the resonances .


In this case, the nth mode , the nth harmon ic, is given by n times the velocity o f sound divided by

2L.


And v is abou t 340 meters per second a t room tempera ture, so it is the sound speed.


Notice it's aga in linear  in n .


In o ther words , if an instrumen t produces a cer tain frequency--


let us say tha t L equals 25 centimeters--


then you can calcu late the frequency f1 .


You know wha t the speed of sound is , 340, so we take n equa ls one, so the frequency tha t we

would get equals 340 divided by 2L, wh ich is 0 .5 in me ters, and so that gives me 680 her tz.


So tha t would be  this big , it would give you 680 her tz, but the second harmonic , f2 , will be double

that.


So it will be 1 ,360 her tz, and so on.


Now, this system which is closed on bo th sides wouldn' t be a very good musica l instrumen t

because your sound would not come out.


So wha t people do , they make them open , a sound cav ity which is jus t open on both sides.


Like this,  for instance--


this  is open on both sides .


And even though it may surpr ise you , if we pu t a little loudspeaker here, we can excite the a ir

column , even in this open system, in a comple te similar way than we do it here in  this c losed

system, and we ge t exactly the same series of frequencies that I pu t here on the blackboard.


There are a lso musical ins trumen ts which are open on one side and closed on the other.


So th is is called an open-open system, and  this would be called a closed-open .


A clarine t is closed-open.


Here I can also ge t a series of resonant frequencies , even though here , the series wouldn't be

exactly  like this ;

it's a little different.


It doesn' t ma tter now how differen t, bu t it is a little different.


Bu t you ge t, aga in, a whole series o f resonant frequenc ies.


So , again , you see that if I make the system longer, then I ge t lower frequencies.


So if  I make the length one me ter, yay b ig,  then I wou ld get a frequency f1 , which is about four

times lower than the one tha t I have there, which is 170 hertz .


And if the second harmonic were, then , 340 hertz, and so on...


So when you see an organ in a church , you see all  these organ pipes , differen t leng ths.


The long ones have the very  low tones, and the shor t ones have the very high tones.


And that is the way that these instrumen ts work .


I have here a wind organ wh ich I have demonstra ted to you before .


It is open on both sides, and because it is corruga ted in a very special way , when I blow wind

past this , it will go in to resonance .


That's to say, wind here is like a spectrum of all possible frequencies .


It's  like the bow on  the v iolin .


And then it picks out the frequencies tha t it likes .


However, if  I increase the speed of  the wind , I can try to force it into h igher frequencies.


So at low wind speeds, I am more like ly to h it the lower harmonics.


At high w ind speeds,  I am more likely to hit the higher harmonics .


This one is 75 cen timeters long, it's open-open ;

and if I were able to h it the first harmonic , tha t would be a frequency o f about 240 her tz.


I may not be able to excite  the lowes t harmon ic, the firs t harmon ic, bu t I'll try .


Bu t cer tainly the h igher harmonics are very easy to excite , and I can make you even listen

simultaneously to more  than one frequency, jus t like the violin s tring , when you s trike it, can

simultaneously oscilla te in a combina tion o f these modes.


So le t me swirl this around.


I'll firs t s tart low .


[tube hums medium tone]


This may be 240 .


[tube hums higher tone ]


This  is de fin ite ly way higher.


[tube hums even higher]


[tube hums higher,  then star ts going back down ]


[tube re turns to first tone]


I think th is is the 240.


This  is the lowes t, th is is the first harmonic .


Were there times that you heard two simultaneously?


[tube hums two tones ]


I hear two .


[tube hums two tones ]


If you play a flu te , tha t... you do the following : You make holes in here , and when you take your

fingers off both holes, then the e ffective length o f the flute is this  long and you ge t a high tone .


If you put your finger on this one , then  the effective length of the flu te is this  long and you ge t a 
lower tone . 

When you put your finger on bo th , the effec tive leng th of the flute is this long and you get an even 
lower tone .


I have here a very special flu te , open on both sides , and here you see the two ho les.


We will firs t close  the two .


That gives us the lowest frequency...


[plays  low tone,  then up and down triad ]


[plays short tune  on low tones]


...that you play the  flu te.


So it's simply a ma tter o f making  the instrumen t longer or shorter .


I have another example here o f an instrumen t which is open here and here is closed .


This  is my version o f a  trombone .


There's a pis ton here .


So th is is a system that is  like th is, bu t I can move th is in and ou t, and so when I have it far  in,  the

frequency would be high...


[plays high tone]


and when I have it here ...


[plays  low tone]


[tones gradually ge t h igher ]


So you see , it's direc tly re lated to the length o f th is trombone.


And if you learn how to play, you can try to play a tune.


I'll try.


[plays "Jingle Bells"]

LEW IN : Thank you.


Resonances are all around us.


When you drive your car, you may have no ticed that all of a sudden , you hear some crazy rattle

somewhere .


It could be your mirror , or it could be some thing e lse, it could be an ash tray, because you are

driving it, and you are exciting it w ith the frequency with which the wheels go around and you may

hit a resonant  frequency .


You go a little slower and  the rattle stops , but something else may start to ra ttle.


The reason why the firs t ra ttle s topped, because you go off resonance , but you may go on

resonance o f ano ther object.


All objects tha t you have in your room have pre ferred resonant frequencies .


Whether they are the po ts or the pans or whe ther  it is your refr igerator, or anything you can think

of, everything has resonan t frequenc ies.


Your body has resonant  frequencies .


If I took you in my hands and I would star t to shake you , then if I do it at low frequency , not much

would happen , bu t there would be one  frequency tha t your arms beg in to move like this , like

they're physical pendu lums , r ight? And if I hit  tha t frequency, then indeed there wou ld be a s trong

response, and so your body has many resonant frequencies: your arms, your  legs, your head ,

everything . 

We a lso exper ience, all o f us, emotional resonances--

a sma ll inpu t, a huge ou tpu t. 

Falling in love is an emo tiona l resonance. 

If someone touches a sensitive nerve,  that is a resonance. 

Someone could say some thing to you and it could be a very sensitive issue for you, and you go 
nonlinear! Your response is unbe lievab ly strong! That, in my view , is also a form of an emo tiona l 
resonance. 

I have here  two tun ing forks.


And these tuning forks are designed in such a way tha t all I wou ld have to do is just bang them

and they will pick out  their own resonan t frequencies.


The tun ing fork  is very s imp le, like this.


I g ive it a kick , and the kick is  like dumping a who le spectrum of  frequencies on it, and it picks ou t

the ones tha t it likes , which is this one , and tha t's the one a t wh ich it will resonate .


It's possible  that  I can excite it at higher frequencies, a t higher harmonics, bu t tha t's a  little hard,

even, with a tuning  fork.


So th is one is 256 her tz.


[plays  low tone]


So the prongs move 256 times per second, and  this one is 440 hertz .


[plays higher tone]


And you hear no overtones--


you don' t hear h igher harmonics.


If I take some thing as simple as a wineglass  like this , it has many, many norma l-mode

frequencies, many resonant frequencies .


The lowest one is very easy to excite, and  I w ill do tha t.


I will rub it with my finger.


Rubbing is  like striking a string w ith a bow .


It's all the same-- I expose it  to lots of  frequencies, it ignores them all, it p icks ou t the one that it

likes, the resonant frequency, the norma l mode , the na tural frequency .


And wha t the glass will do , in its  lowes t harmonic--


in its first harmonic--


it w ill sort o f oscilla te, like this, and  I will show tha t to you la ter  in this  lec ture in slow mo tion .


Bu t let me first make you listen to the frequency.


It's around 430 ... 470 hertz .


I have to wash my hands because I have chalk on my fingers and because o f the chalk , I w ill no t

be ab le to excite it.


I have to really rub it with some liquid , and there fore my hands have to be chalk- free.


Chalk is  jus t too greasy--


let me  try.


[plays high tone]


Very clear.


I remember when I was a s tuden t, we had a fter-dinner speakers.


If we got bored, we would all do this .


Let me  tell you , tha t makes a lot o f no ise.


So , again , I'm no t exciting it with the 470 her tz.


I'm dumping the whole frequency ...


the whole spectrum o f frequenc ies on it, and it picks ou t the one that it likes, which , in this case, is

the 470 hertz .


Resonances can be des tructive , and rumor has  it  tha t there are singers , women who take a

wineglass and they do exactly what I did .


They do this .


[plays high tone]


They listen care fully , they genera te that frequency w ith  their voice,  they  increase the volume o f

the voice, and  then the rumor has  it that bang , the glass goes.


In o ther words , the amplitude o f the glass becomes so large that you ge t so high so close to

resonance and so much power goes into it because of the volume o f the voice tha t the glass

breaks.


I'm going to try to break a glass w ith you , and you' ll see tha t it is no t easy.


I have here a wineglass.


It's almost the same as the one I have  there .


And we can illuminate that glass with a s trobe ligh t, wh ich you see here .


And I'm going  to show you  there the disp lay o f tha t strobe light.


And the reason why we strobe it is tha t we wan t you to see, as we excite the exact frequency of

the glass, we wan t you  to see the motion o f the glass.


And the way we can make you see the motion is by strobing it no t exactly at  the frequency o f the

sound bu t a little bit different frequency.


So you w ill see the stroboscopic mo tion , then, o f the glass.


So I can... a lready I will make it darker shortly , but I want you to see a t least most o f this .


I can generate , then, the 470 hertz, wh ich is very close  to the resonan t frequency.


[plays high tone]


This  is the tone tha t we will use.


We will increase the volume , and then we will try to hit that resonance just righ t.


We may be o ff by a few her tz.


We have  to be right on within a hertz , and then we' ll see whe ther we can make the glass break .


Now, I wan t to warn you, the sound is go ing to be very strong, so you may ... as the time goes on,

as we go to higher volume , you may wan t to turn , you may want to close your ears.


In fact, I will use  this to protect my ears, and  I w ill even use th is to protec t my eyes in case the

glass migh t break, which I doubt whe ther  it will, bu t who knows?


All righ t, so le t's make it very dark.


[tone con tinues]


So , you see here the glass.


It's not do ing very much.


And I'm now going  to increase the volume o f the sound .


[high tone gets  louder]


I'm going to cover my ears now .


We a lready begin to see some mo tion .


I'm no t sure  that  I am on resonance .


[high tone continues,  becomes  louder ]


We increase the volume .


[high tone continues, louder]


[tone con tinues]


[tone con tinues]


I'm now chang ing the  frequency .


[similar tone p laying ]


Getting very close .


[tone con tinues,  getting slightly  louder]


Getting very close .


[shatters  loudly ]


[tone con tinues]


[tone fades away ]


[lower tone plays  as slow-mo tion rep lay begins ]


[shatters slowly]


I men tioned tha t resonances can be very destructive, and there are some striking examp les in 
history. 

In fact, you may have ... 

When there's a s torm, you may have seen the traffic signs, which... just a sign on a po le, that the 
traffic s ign s tarts doing this . 

This  is strange, because there's a w ind. 

Wind is like a spec trum o f a ll k inds o f frequencies . 

It's  like blow ing air  into a musical instrument. 

And then this tra ffic sign just picks ou t the  frequency that it likes , and then , if  the wind is s trong

enough , it could be very des tructive .


And the most str iking example of des truction is tha t o f a bridge wh ich was built.


And that is the Tacoma Bridge , on the Wes t Coast, which is very dramatic , and , o f course, I will

have to show you that movie .


You will see wha t the wind can do to a bridge.


So we'll star t this movie , and then we'll make it dark .


FILM ANNOUNCER : On the first of July, 1940, a delegation o f citizens met in Wash ington State.


The weather was beau tiful, the occasion his toric, and the speechmaking and fan fare altoge ther

appropria te.


This was the grand opening of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.


From the beginn ing , the bridge , which spanned Puge t Sound be tween Sea ttle and Tacoma , was

traveled in style , as we ll it shou ld have been.


The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was one o f the longer suspension bridges on earth.


And if somebody hadn't overlooked some thing , it probably wou ld have remained one of the

longer suspension bridges on ear th.


The problem wasn't that righ t from the beg inning, a lot of people didn't pay a lot o f a ttention to 
details-- they d id. 

Bu t somewhere along the line, and this was obvious  in the end , it looks as if someone forgo t the 
significance o f resonance .


[low rumbling as wind blows]


Among other things , the Tacoma Narrows Br idge was the most spectacular Aeolian harp in

history.


Unfortuna tely, its first per formance was des tined to run only about four mon ths.


[sirens wailing]


In the mean time, she was a beautifu l bridge ...


beautifu l, bu t a little strange.


Even before cons truction was comple ted , people observed its pecu liar behavior .


That was because even in a ligh t breeze, ripp les ran along the bridge .


After a while ,


one o f the loca l humor ists ca lled her "Galloping Ger tie ." And for fair ly obvious reasons, the name

stuck, at leas t until the seven th o f November, 1940.


Then as now, Seattle and Tacoma were spor ts-minded cities.


For four mon ths , a regional sport was to drive across the bridge on a windy day .


While some cla imed it was  like riding a roller coaster, others found it a little d isconcerting to see

the car  in  front disappear.


How popular this bridge spor t was, or to wha t ex ten t it migh t have spread across the coun try, is

anybody's guess .


On November 7 , 1940 , the winds were rela tively moderate, about 40 miles per hour.


A new mode appeared .


Rather than ripple , the bridge began to twist.


[wind blowing ]


A w ind of 40 miles per hour  is no t too strong, bu t it was strong enough to star t the bridge twis ting

violently.


And at 11 :00 a .m., it fell.


[low roaring ]


[loud crashing ]


[rumbling as wind blows ]


[rumbling con tinues ]


LEW IN : Amazing-- amazing wha t resonance can do .


With musical ins truments , we have ...


we're stuck to  the speed of sound in air , which is 340 meters per second .


And when I speak to you , I have here a sound cavity which has a cer tain size , a cer tain shape .


And while I speak, th is size and this shape changes all  the time .


And that gives my voice a very character istic sound tha t makes  it possib le for me  to make a low

sound.


It makes it possible for me to make a high sound.


And no matter how I speak, you will say, "Yeah , there's no question .


Tha t's Walter Lewin--


that's clear ." It's very recogn izable .


Each one of you and I have a very well recognizable vo ice.


The situa tion would change if I could change the speed of sound in my system.


And helium, which has a very differen t mo lecular weigh t from air , has a way higher speed than

the speed of sound in air .


It's abou t 2.7 times higher, 2 .7 times 340 me ters per second.


So if  I fill my system with helium--


apart from the  fact that there's no oxygen in helium, so I wouldn' t survive very long;  tha t's a

detail...


[class laughs]


LEW IN : If I  fill my system with helium, then , of course, my vocal cords and my sound cavity here ,

they don't know that.


So they do the same th ing that they normally do when they speak to you .


However, since the speed o f sound is much higher here in my sound cavity, the frequency that it

will produce is way higher, and  I sound very differen tly .


The problem, however, is, as I mentioned , there is no oxygen in helium, and yet if I only take a

little bit o f helium, it doesn' t work very well and you don' t hear much difference, so I have to really

take a lo t of he lium, and  I will try tha t.


Bu t for tha t I pay a small price , and the small price is that you can fain t.


I'll try  just to s tay away from  the fainting level.


So , here is helium, and I have to let my air ou t first and  then ge t he lium in and maybe let the

helium out aga in and let  the helium in aga in.


And during tha t time I can't speak , but then, when  I think I'm full enough with helium, I w ill say a

few words to you.


So , let's get  the pressure up  to the leve l tha t I like.


[exhaling]


[helium hissing from hose ]


[inha les]


[helium hissing again ]


[inha les again ]


[in very high vo ice]: I told you it would sound very d ifferently .


[class laughs and applauds]


LEW IN : Well, I hope you enjoyed  this, and  I'll see you Wednesday .


Thank you.


[class laughs]
