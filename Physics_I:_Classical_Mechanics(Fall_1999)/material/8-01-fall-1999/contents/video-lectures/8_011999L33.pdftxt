8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 33 

Liquids are incompressible ; gases are no t incompressible.


When you decrease the volume of a gas by 50%, tha t's no problem.


It's  impossible to do tha t for a liquid .


In liquids, the a toms and the molecules e ffec tively touch each other, whereas  in gases , they are

very far apart, so tha t's why you can compress the gases.


If you take air at one a tmospheres , the density is a thousand times less than the density of wa ter.


What it tells you is tha t the molecules are much further apart.


It is an experimental fac t tha t there is a simple relation between the pressure tha t you see there,

the volume of a gas, the tempera ture of a gas  in degrees Kelvin , and the number of molecu les

that you have .


Now, when you see the word "molecules," I may o ften mean "atoms ." I rea lize tha t helium and

neon and kryp ton and argon are atomic gases , and tha t O2 and H2 and CO2 are molecular

gases.


So I will use that word "mo lecules" even when I mean "atoms," and maybe vice versa, jus t for

simplic ity .


The re lation tha t exists be tween these quan tities, PV equals nRT: pressure , vo lume, n is the

number o f moles--


I'll ge t back to  that--


R is the universa l gas constant, which is 8 .3 jou les per degree Ke lvin, and T must be in degrees

Kelvin .


So , what is a mole? A mo le has a lways about 6 .02 times ten to the 23 molecules , or a toms, in the

case tha t you have helium, but I will ca ll tha t mo lecules .


And th is number is called Avogadro's number .


So tha t's the de finition o f a mole.


If you take a mo le of helium, or a mole o f oxygen, or CO2, or N2, it doesn't matter, it always has

this number o f mo lecules , approximately.


Now, each of these subs tances have very different masses.


If I take, for ins tance , carbon, then one mo le of carbon would weigh very close  to 12 grams .


If I take helium, one mole o f helium would we igh very close to  four grams .


And if I took oxygen two , O2 , then one mole wou ld be very close to 32 grams . 

So the masses are very d ifferen t in a mole bu t not  the number o f molecu les or  the number o f 
atoms. 

When I take a neu tral atom, then we have a nucleus , and the nucleus conta ins protons and 
neutrons .


It has Z protons and it has N neu trons .


The protons are positively charged , and it has Z elec trons if it is a neu tral atom.


There is almos t no weigh t in the elec trons; you can almost ignore tha t.


Everyth ing is in the protons and in the neu trons.


N plus Z is ca lled A, and that's called  the atomic mass number .


Let's  look a t carbon in a little bit more de tail.


If we have carbon--


and I call it carbon 12 for now , you'll see shor tly why--


then carbon has always six pro tons  in the nucleus; otherwise it isn't carbon .


And when it has six neu trons, then A is 12.


That's why we call it carbon 12 .


So the a tomic mass number o f carbon is 12, bu t if you had, for  ins tance , carbon 14--


which happens to be radioactive--


again , six protons, otherwise it wou ldn' t be carbon , you would have eigh t neutrons now , and now

you would have...


atomic mass number would be 14 .


A mo le is this number in grams , and so you see carbon ...


is the a tomic mass number  in grams--


you see 12 there .


If you go to helium, it has two pro tons and two neutrons , so A is four--


that's why you see your four grams.


If you take oxygen , it has eigh t protons and eight neu trons, so A is 16 , but you have O2 in gas

form, so now your atomic mass number has to be doub led to 32.


And so a mole o f O2 is there fore 32 grams .


In fact, Avogadro's number is de fined through carbon 12.


If you take 12 grams o f carbon 12, and you coun t the number of a toms tha t you have , then you

find exactly Avogadro's number .


That's the definition of that number , and tha t's very close to wha t we have there , 6.02 times ten to

the 23rd.


The mass of the proton and the mass of  the neu tron are nearly equa l.


I wro te down m2 for the mass o f the neu tron ; o f course, tha t should have been m of n .


So the mass o f a molecule , or an atom, whatever the case may be , would be this number A--


because tha t's the sum of  the protons and neutrons--


times the mass of  the neu trons and the pro tons.


And so this  is A times--


approximate ly, I should pu t a w iggle here--

1.66 times ten to the minus 27 kilograms . 

So tha t's now an individual mass of either an atom or a molecu le, and all tha t informa tion , you

have there and tha t's, o f course , on the Web.


So , let's do a trivial example .


I take gases, any kind of gas--


you choose wha tever you wan t--


and I take one atmosphere.


So tha t means tha t the pressure is 1 .03 times ten to the fifth pascal.


I do it at room tempera ture , so T is 293 degrees Kelvin .


And I take in a ll cases only one mole , so n is one.


And I'm asking you now, wha t will be the vo lume o f tha t gas? Well, you take the gas law , and it

tells you tha t V, the volume , equals nRT div ided by P.


You know n is one .


You know R, 1 .03...


excuse me , you know...


[laughs]:  I'm a little b it ahead o f myself.


You know R, which is 8.3 , you know the temperature , which is 293 , and you know the pressure,

which is 1.03 times ten  to the fifth .


And when you calcula te that, you  find someth ing very c lose to 24 liters , and a liter  is abou t a

thousand cubic cen timeters .


And it's independent o f whether  it's he lium or oxygen or nitrogen or CO2 .


As long as you have a gas, one mole a t one a tmosphere pressure and room  temperature a lways

has the same volume of about 24 liters.


If a gas obeys that law exac tly, we call it an ideal gas .


That's why we call tha t the ideal-gas  law .


And many gases come very close to that.


In fact, if you took oxygen , O2 , and you take one mo le of oxygen a t room tempera ture and at one

atmosphere pressure and you were  to ca lcula te its volume,  the actua l vo lume tha t you measure

is only one- ten th o f a percent smaller than what you would have found with the ideal-gas  law .


If you do it a t 20 a tmospheres, it would still be only two percent sma ller, so it's a very good

approximation in many cases.


What is very surprising , tha t in th is ideal-gas  law , the mass of the a toms and the molecules do no t

show up at all.


And that is very puzzling--


you wouldn't expec t tha t a t all.


And I'll show you why you wouldn' t expect that.


Let's take two differen t kinds o f gases with very differen t masses o f the molecu les, bu t we have

the same number o f moles , we have the same volume , we have the same tempera ture and

there fore, we must have the same pressure, according  to the ideal-gas  law .


Bu t the masses of  the mo lecules--

very differen t. 

So , here we have some o f these molecu les 
and the number of... density is the same , because the number o f a toms is the same and the 
volume is the same . 

Now, these molecu les are flying in all direc tions with differen t speeds.


I will just now , for simplicity, take some average speed , and I assume th is is going in this

direction .


It's heading for the wa ll of the con tainer, th is area .


It hits the wall, there's an elas tic co llision, and it comes back in exactly the same direc tion .


So there is momentum transfer , and the momentum transfer for one co llision is 2mv, because it

comes  in w ith mv in this direction , it comes back w ith mv in tha t direction , so the momen tum

transfer  is 2mv .


Bu t I'm in teres ted in the momentum  transfer per second, not jus t for one mo lecule .


And now , o f course, I have to multip ly by the velocity , because if the velocity  is high, you have a

lot of bombardmen ts per second on here .


For each bombardmen t, this  is the momentum transfer , but if there are many, well, you have to

multiply that, of course,  then , by the speed.


So the momen tum  transfer per second is proportional, let's say , to mv squared .


mv comes from the momentum, from one partic le, and v comes from the fact that...


the number tha t hit it per second.


Now, momen tum trans fer per second is clearly ...


It's a force, proportional to  the force , and tha t is proportional to the pressure .


And yet the pressure is no t a ffected by the mass, no tice? If these are the same , the pressure

must also be the same .


And so there's only one conclusion tha t you can draw , which is very nonin tuitive--


that  the pressure can on ly be the same if, for a given  tempera ture,  this product, mv squared , is

independent o f the mass o f the molecule .


How can mv squared possib ly be independent o f the mass of the molecule? There's only one

way that that's possible--


that if you take two different masses, two gases with to tally d ifferen t mass of the molecu les, that

this product is always the same for a given tempera ture , and tha t, indeed , is the case .


So if you take , for  ins tance , he lium, and you compare that with oxygen and the ratio o f these two

masses is four to 32--


this  is eight  times heavier than  this one--


and you have them a t a cer tain temperature , then the mass o f the he lium times the mean speed

of the helium squared is the mass of the oxygen molecules times the mean speed squared of  the

oxygen.


And so what that means  is tha t if the oxygen molecu le is eigh t times more massive--


this one--


then the velocity  is the square roo t o f eigh t times smaller, because the ratio, 32 over four , is e ight.


So the oxygen molecu les have a lower speed , so tha t the produc t, mv squared, is always the

same.


Oxygen molecules at room tempera tures have a speed of about 480 meters per second, and so

the helium is the square roo t o f eigh t times higher.


If you have a mix ture of oxygen and helium, then one gas would have an average speed o f 480

meters per second for the molecules, and the other would be 1 ,350 meters per second .


That is the on ly way that the gas law can hold.


It is a consequence of the gas law. 

You very o ften see  the gas law wr itten in a d ifferen t way, and you see it written as PV equals 
capital N times k times T. 

You see tha t also there . 

And th is N , now, is the  total number o f mo lecules that you have . 

Don't confuse  tha t with little n, which is the number o f moles that you have. 

So th is is the total number o f mo lecules ,

and k  is called Boltzmann's constant.


And since Nk must be the same as nR, if you compare  the two gas  laws , the one up there and

the one here , you can see tha t the way tha t k is de fined , it is noth ing but R divided by N of A.


k is R divided by Avogadro's number, because little n , remember , is the to tal number of

molecu les tha t you have divided by N o f A.


So if you substitu te that, you ge t this as a result, and so th is is 8.3 d ivided by 6.02  times ten to  the

23rd, and that is abou t 1 .38 times ten to the minus 23rd joules per Kelvin .


And you can use  that number .


If you want  to, you can use e ither this re lationship or you can use tha t one, whichever is

convenien t.


They are identical.


So , let's now bring the ideal-gas  law to a  test.


And the way I'm going to bring it to a test is as follows: I have here a volume, copper .


There's a ir ins ide.


And I'm going  to heat  that up .


I'll make you a drawing on  the blackboard .


Here is tha t volume , and there's an extremely th in tube , which has almost no volume , and a t the

end is a pressure gauge .


So there is a pressure gauge here which gives us the pressure, and the pressure is given in

pounds per square inch , much  to my regret, but  that's the way  it is .


For your recollec tion , one atmosphere is approx ima tely 15 pounds per square inch.


It is also a gauge tha t measures overpressure .


In o ther words , if you expose it to one a tmosphere , it will read zero .


Just when you go to the gas s ta tion and you measure the pressure of your tires , tha t is a lso a

gauge tha t measures overpressure , the difference between inside and ou tside .


This has a valve here , and I can connect it with the outside world.


And when I do  that, then the pressure is very close to one a tmosphere , regardless o f what  the 
temperature is here , because it's connec ted to the universe, so the pressure in here will then be 
one a tmosphere . 

And that's the situa tion that we have now when this valve is open , and it is in melting ice , And so

melting ice--


T1 is 273 degrees Kelvin.


P1 is one a tmosphere , and V1 is some value tha t I don' t know .


I close  this va lve.


Thereby the number o f moles o f a ir in  there is fixed ; tha t's no t going  to change.


So we have one atmosphere inside now,

and whatever n is, it's o f no impor tance , but it's no t going to change.


Now I'm going to put it in boiling water , and so I know now that T2 will become 373 degrees

Kelvin .


I want to know now wha t P2 is , and the volume is hardly going  to change at all.


It changes because o f the expansion coe fficien t of copper.


And I made a small calcu lation based on th is size , and it turns ou t tha t the extra volume that you

get because of the heat is only .5 percen t of the origina l volume , so we can forge t the  fact that V2

is just a hair  larger than V1.


It's close enough  to say that these are  the same .


And of course we have the same number o f mo les.


So now we can pred ict with the gas  law wha t the pressure is going  to be when we s tick it in the

boiling wa ter.


So we're going to get that P1 V1 equa ls n R T1 ; P2 V2 equals n R T2 .


I d ivide these two equa tions , lose my n and my R--


we agreed tha t the volume was the same--


and so we find tha t P1 divided by P2 , T1 d ivided by T2 , or the pressure P2 , which is our goa l,

equals the one a tmosphere pressure, which is P1 , times T2 divided by T1 .


And that is...


T2 is 373 , T1 is 273, so it is one atmosphere times 373 divided by 273 .


That's wha t the gas  law predic ts.


And that ratio is 1 .366 , so P2 is then 1 .366 times one a tmosphere.


Now, this gauge is an overpressure gauge , so there fore you're not go ing to see th is number , but

you're going to see the difference w ith one a tmosphere .


So wha t the gauge will show us  is 0.366 times one atmosphere, and since it is calibra ted in 
pounds per square inch , it is 0.366 times 15 pounds per square inch, and  tha t is abou t... 

something like 5 .4 pounds per square inch. 

So tha t's what  I pred ict, and we'll see how close we ge t. 

You're going to see this , if all works well, on... 

Yeah , there it is. 

I'm going to set you ... 

the ligh t s itua tion a little be tter for you . 

I can even make it a little darker . 

So , you see here ... this gauge. 

Note tha t it is zero, even though it is  in ice wa ter. 

This va lve is open , and so it is at zero because it measures only overpressure. 

And now we're going  to close this valve. 

The va lve is now closed . 

And we're going  to s tick  it here as this objec t; that is the volume . 

It looks  like a bathroom  floa ter to me, in the toilet flush. 

That's wha t it is, probably. 

And now  it goes in to boiling wa ter. 

And now  look at  the pressure. 

There it goes--

three , 31 /2 , four ... 

That's overpressure in pounds per square inch. 

Four and a ha lf.


I'll just give it a little bit more time.


It would take a wh ile , o f course, because gas  is a very good insula tor, so it may take a wh ile for

that gas  in the copper ball to ...


It's already close to five.


We don't have to wait, o f course, for the thing to become all  the way 5 .5 , 5 .4 , but it w ill probab ly

go up if we wa it.


It's now five .


Not much sense in waiting .


What I wan t you to realize , wha t happens...


or I wan t to ask you , actua lly, wha t happens  if I open the valve now?


Yeah? What happens? Yeah.


So if  I open the valve , then one a tmosphere , some of  the high-pressure s tuff gets ou t, one

atmosphere settles  inside , and so, since th is one is an overpressure gauge, it will be zero.


So righ t now, it's... it's five.


That's fine with me--


that's very close .


That's within eight percen t.


Previous class, we had 5.3, bu t we were a little b it more pa tien t.


I will open the va lve now, and wa tch what happens.


It goes back to zero.


So some air was  le t ou t, because the pressure of the a ir inside was higher , was h igher than one

atmosphere .


So , we've seen a tes t, a reasonab le test, firs t applica tion of  the idea l-gas law.


A gas can turn into a liquid , and a liquid can become a solid, and that depends entirely on the

kind o f subs tance , the temperature, and the pressure that we have.


And th is brings us to  the field of wha t we ca ll phase diagrams.


I will show you your first schema tic of a phase diagram, which is a lso on the Web .


Here you see a phase d iagram--


very intu itive.


Here is pressure, here is tempera ture .


Imagine that we have a cylinder and we put gas  in that cylinder and we pu t a p iston on  top and

we push it down, slowly push ing it down .


So we s tart here with gas a t a particu lar tempera ture , which we're no t going to change, and we

slowly push  the piston down.


In this tra jectory , the idea l-gas  law would hold.


Temperature remains constant, so if you look a t the gas law, PV remains cons tant.


That's called Boyle's Law , by the way, that the product of pressure and volume remains constant.


So the pressure in the gas goes up , the volume goes down, pressure goes up , volume goes

down, pressure goes up, un til I hit th is po int.


And now  liquid is going to be  formed, so the pressure is now high enough at th is temperature to

form liquid .


If I push further , the pressure will no t go up.


All the gas will firs t turn in to liquid, all o f it, until the las t molecu le; and no t until everything has

become liquid can I push even fur ther onto  the liqu id,  to increase the pressure on the liquid.


It may be a silly th ing to do , but  I cou ld do tha t.


You're no t going to compress it very much, bu t you can try.


And in some cases , if you put a tremendous pressure on it, you may turn the liquid in to a solid.


And then you reach this domain , where you have a solid.


What is much less  in tuitive--


that if you d id it a t a lower temperature and you squeezed the vo lume so that  the pressure would

go up , tha t you may now reach the point here in th is phase diagram whereby no liquid is formed--


no condensation of liquid--


but you get immedia tely the formation of crystals.


So you go from the gas phase immed iately  into  the solid phase .


If you push fur ther down the pis ton , the pressure will no t go up un til all the gas has become solid,

and then it will continue to go further .


Suppose  this were one atmosphere here , and I took some ice--


or you can take a p iece of iron at one a tmosphere--


and it's a very  low tempera ture , it's a solid.


And I star t hea ting it up , bu t I keep the pressure one atmosphere .


It's a so lid , it's s till a solid .


At  this poin t, it begins to melt.


This w ill be the melting po int.


And when I keep hea ting it, the tempera ture will not go up un til all the solid has been melted in to

liquid .


Then I can increase the  temperature.


Then the liquid will get ho tter un til you reach this  line.


And when you reach this  line, some o f the liquid will turn in to gas.


It will bo il at one a tmosphere .


You will see it boil.


You canno t increase the temperature.


If it is wa ter, it w ill stay at 100 degrees cen tigrade.


There's noth ing you can do un til all the liqu id has become gas.


We call tha t wa ter vapor.


Then after tha t, the tempera ture can be fur ther  increased.


So th is po int wou ld be a melting point for  ice and wa ter, and th is wou ld be the boiling point a t one

atmosphere .


So tha t's the idea behind a phase diagram, and we are going to use them today for some o f our

experiments .


I have here a fire ex tinguisher, and a fire ex tinguisher  is filled with CO2--


that's a given .


And I ask myself the ques tion--


seriously, th is is really a question that I ask myself; it's not some thing I made up for you--


I ask myself the question: Is there liquid ins ide, liquid carbon d ioxide , or  is there gas  inside? And

if so , wha t cou ld the pressure be?


So I measured the volume o f tha t tank .


It's abou t 40 cen time ters h igh and it has a diame ter o f about 15 centimeters .


So it's a cylinder .


This  is about 40 centimeters and th is is abou t 15 centimeters.


So the volume--


easy to calculate : 2.3  times ten to the minus three cubic me ters.


It's clear tha t it is at room tempera ture--


that's nonnego tiable--


so tha t's abou t 293 degrees Ke lvin , the same  temperature that we are at.


So now I wan t to know how many moles I have , the little n.


And wha t I read on the label tha t this tank, when it is full, weighs 31 pounds , but when it's emp ty,

no CO2 inside , it weighs 21 pounds...


So I have the mass o f the gas--


of the CO2 gas , whatever it is, maybe it's  liqu id--


is ten pounds.


That's a given .


And that is 4,500 grams--


a pound is 450 grams--


so I know wha t n is , because the atomic mass number of CO2 is 12 p lus 32 is 44 .


And so tha t is 4 ,500 divided by 44 ; tha t's close enough  to 100.


So I have 100 moles.


So now I can ask myself, what is the pressure?  If th is were a gas, wha t would be the pressure?

Well, if th is were a gas, then the pressure P would be n times R times T divided by the volume.


I s tuck in  the numbers, and ou t comes ten  to the eighth .


Ten to the e igh th pascal--


an enormous number .


Ten to the e igh th pascal is about 1,000 atmospheres, so I doubted very much whe ther there is

gas inside, because I said  to myself, a t tha t h igh pressure, CO2 probab ly becomes a liquid.


And so I looked up on the Web--


in fact, Dave Poo ley d id tha t for me , my gradua te student--


looked on the Web , and we found the phase diagram  for carbon dioxide.


And wha t do you see? Th is is pressure in atmospheres .


It's a s trange scale , because it goes five , ten , 15 , then there is an in terruption and it goes to 73.


And th is is the tempera ture, zero degrees and 20 degrees.


And so a t 20 degrees ...


Since we know, if there is  liqu id inside there...


If it were a liquid , then the liquid has to be in equilibrium w ith  the gas.


So you go up here, and you see there's no way the 1,000 a tmospheres, the 1,000 a tmospheres

somewhere  there in the corridor .


So already a t a temperature ...


Already a t a pressure of something like 60 atmospheres, it begins to be liquid .


You can't see that 60 here on th is scale because it jumps there.


Bu t I ca lled the fire depar tment, and they said it's about 900 pounds per square inch , wh ich is 60

atmospheres.


And so this ... this canis ter con tains, then, liquid and gas and s tays exactly at that line.


It canno t be h igher , it canno t be lower--


think abou t tha t--


because gas and liquid a t tha t line exist in coexistence.


And the only way they can do that is exactly a t tha t pressure if the tempera ture is 20 degrees.


And when you release , when you open the valve , then the liqu id CO2 will  turn into gas , but the

pressure will a lways remain 60 a tmospheres until you have used up all the liquid, and no t until

then will the pressure come below 60 a tmospheres.


We dealt earlier w ith  the hydrosta tic equilibrium, hydros tatic equ ilibr ium o f flu ids in general, but

we used it on ly for  liquids, to calculate hydros tatic pressure.


And the equation for hydrostatic equ ilibrium--


you will see  that, undoubtedly, on the fina l--


equals minus rho times g .


And th is is very easy to use for a liquid , because a liquid is  incompressible , so rho is not a

function of pressure.


So you can in tegra te th is ou t very easily, as we did.


You ge t a linear re lation be tween P and y .


So if  I have here y and I have here hydrosta tic pressure and le t this be y zero--


that is , the sea level, I call that zero--


and let th is be minus 4,000 me ters, 4 ,000 meters  lower , then the pressure jus t goes  like this .


Here it w ill be around 400 a tmospheres, and it drops  linearly.


When you go up  to the surface , it drops  linearly.


Well, it may be one a tmosphere here because tha t's the barome tric pressure , but that's a detail.


I rea lly want this to be the hydros tatic pressure , so this  is rho...


minus rho times g times y.


For gases , this would be very differen t, though, because with a gas , the dens ity does depend on

pressure.


And now I will ca lcula te, I will derive for you how the pressure changes with altitude in our

atmosphere , and it's going  to be very differen t from th is.


And I will do tha t under the follow ing assump tion--


which is no t an ideal assumption, bu t it's no t very bad--


namely , tha t the  temperature in our a tmosphere is roughly constant everywhere .


And we'll  take zero degrees cen tigrade.


Here it's a little warmer ; when you go up, it's a little co lder.


We call tha t an iso thermal a tmosphere .


What is the dens ity of a gas? Well, it is the mass of a gas divided by  its volume .


I take a cer tain volume and I have N mo lecules  in there .


And each molecule has mass m and this  is the volume , so this  is the density.


Bu t now I go to my gas  law there , and I say, "Aha! Cap ital N, "which is the number of molecu les

divided by the volume , is also P d ivided by kT." So this  is P div ided by kT times m.


So now I take  this equa tion , and I say, "Aha! dP/dy equals minus Pm divided by kT times g ." I

bring the P under here and I bring the dy there, so we get dP divided by P equals minus mg

divided by kT--


which is some kind o f a cons tan t--


times dy .


Let's first  talk abou t tha t cons tan t.


That cons tant must have a dimension , one divided by meters, because th is is dimensionless--


pressure divided by pressure has no d imension .


dy has the dimension o f leng th , so this mus t have  the d imension o f one over  leng th.


In fact, I can calcula te wha t kT over mg is .


That shou ld, then , have a dimension o f leng th .


I know k;  I know T; I take zero

degrees cen tigrade, so T is 273; I know wha t g is .


What do I take for the molecule... a molecule o f a ir? What is an air molecu le? Well, we have 20%

oxygen, we have 80% n itrogen.


The atomic mass number of oxygen is 32, nitrogen is 28.


Bu t rea lly, there is more nitrogen than oxygen.


So take 29 as a reasonable a tomic mass number for a mean mass o f an a ir molecu le, and so you

will get, then, that it is rough ly 29  times the 1.66 times ten to the minus 27 kilograms.


And you s tick tha t in tha t equa tion , you can' t be too far off.


And wha t you  find , tha t this  is 8,000 me ters.


It has the un it leng th , or it is eight kilome ters, and we call this H zero .


So I will rewrite th is a little.


We're a lmos t done with our integra tion.


So I will rewrite the equation and in troduce for that constant one over H zero , because ,

remember,  I turned it upside down there to ge t length.


So we have dP over P equals minus one over H zero times dy .


I integrate this between P zero, which is sea level, and P at some a ltitude h , and so dy be tween

zero, sea leve l, and altitude h .


And that's an easy in tegra l, so I get ln P at altitude h divided by P zero equa ls minus h divided by 
H zero, because an in tegral o f dy from zero to h is simp ly h. 

And so what do I find now? That the pressure a t a ltitude h equals P zero times e to  the minus h 
divided by H zero.


This  is the altitude in the a tmosphere, and if you take th is H, then th is is the a ltitude in kilome ters.


H zero would then be e igh t kilometers .


And so if you use this equa tion, you can calcu late what the pressure is at the various a ltitudes  in

our a tmosphere, and  tha t's no t a bad approximation.


Everest is 8.9 kilome ters high .


If you use this equa tion , you w ill find tha t the a tmospheric pressure is there only one-third of wha t

we have here .


Not enough oxygen  to live.


I d id quite a bit of observing a t an optica l observatory  in Chile wh ich was a t an altitude o f 2 ,400

meters.


At 2 ,400 meters , the pressure is 3 /4 of an a tmosphere according to th is equation, and wa ter 
doesn't boil  there at 100 degrees cen tigrade. 

Here a t sea leve l, it does, bu t a t 3/4 o f an a tmosphere , it boils at 92 degrees cen tigrade, so you 
can never time to get a so ft-boiled egg.


You can never time tha t properly , because you're used  to the 100 degrees cen tigrade.


In fact, in the kitchen , there were tables which indica ted how  long you would have  to boil po tatoes

to get them  to what you wan t to at 90 degrees cen tigrade.


That's all you can get--


you can't go any higher.


On Moun t Everes t, wa ter w ill boil a t 72 degrees centigrade, so there's no way you can ge t

yourself there some real hot  food .


So you need a pressure cooker there, of course . 

If you go to 30 kilome ters altitude , and you ask this equation wha t the pressure is, it's 1 /45 of an 
atmosphere , it's only 17 millime ters mercury. 

Water at 20 degrees cen tigrade would boil a t tha t altitude. 

I want to show you the phase d iagram o f water. 

This  is the phase diagram of wa ter. 

And wha t I want  to do is , I wan t to take some water and bring it to an altitude of abou t 30

kilome ters.


At 30 kilome ters, the water a t 20 degrees cen tigrade should s tart  to boil.


And how do I know that? Th is is the phase d iagram for water.


Zero degrees centigrade, 100 degrees cen tigrade.


This  is pressure in millime ters mercury, and  the sca les are no t very clear.


This  is all we have .


This  is aga in what Dave Pooley go t from the Web  for me.


Now, if you take 20 degrees somewhere here , and you have wa ter at one a tmospheres and 20

degrees--


which is wha t we have in this room--


and I'm go ing to lower the pressure on it...


So I'm going to put it in the bell jar there, and  I'm going to take all the air out so tha t the pressure

goes down and down and down , bu t the tempera ture is not changing , you go down in the liqu id

phase, stays  liqu id... stays liquid ... 

stays liquid ... s tays liquid un til you reach th is po int, and then you have coexis tence between the 
gas and the liquid--

we call that vapor , in the case of wa ter--

and tha t means  it w ill star t to boil. 

And that happens--

and I looked tha t up--

at a pressure of about 17 millime ters mercury , wh ich is equivalen t to 30 kilome ters a ltitude. 

And so we have here some water , room  temperature. 

Pu t it here, pu t it in a bell jar. 

This  is a 19 th-century vin tage o f a bell jar. 

It's very slow .


It will take at leas t five minu tes before we reach tha t low pressure.


Bu t you will see here  the... the wineglass.


There it is.


And we will keep an eye on it, on and off, and when it starts to bo il, I can even read the pressure

here, but  tha t's no t so impor tan t.


I want you to appreciate  the fac t tha t if you keep pumping long enough that you will h it the line 
where gas and liquid are in coexistence with each other, and tha t is our de finition o f boiling. 

So , let me s tart the pump ing and in the mean time , we will do some thing e lse, because it w ill take 
quite some time be fore tha t v intage pump reaches a decent low pressure, which is what we wan t.


We have  to go down to abou t 15, 20 millimeters mercury.


In the mean time, we'll work on someth ing tha t is quite s imilar.


I have a paint can--


you see the pa int can there.


You've seen tha t pain t can before .


You remember it--


we evacua ted it and it imploded, and we unders tood why it imploded .


We filled it with one atmosphere a ir.


This was 25 cen timeters , and this was 15 centime ters.


And we took the air out, and then you ge t an overpressure o f one a tmosphere , which is one

kilogram per square cen timeter .


And th is front cover alone is abou t 375 square centime ters, and so the force is huge! And it

imploded .


You've seen it happen in fron t of your eyes when I pumped it out.


Today I'm going to do something more sub tle bu t with the same effect.


I'm going to pu t in here a little bit o f water .


Here is a little bit of wa ter--


there it goes .


And I'm going  to bring th is wa ter to a boil.


At  this momen t,  there is one a tmosphere air  in that can .


Bu t as the wa ter star ts to boil, the vapor pressure o f the wa ter a t 100 degrees centigrade 
becomes one atmosphere. 

And so the can fills exclusively w ith wa ter vapor and dr ives out all the air . 

So the air  is gone--

the momen t that we see s team coming ou t, the air  is gone. 

Then I will tigh ten it, I will close it, and I w ill pu t the can here and le t it cool. 

What wou ld be the water vapor pressure at 20 degrees centigrade? I jus t told you that shor tly. 

That is abou t 17 millime ters mercury. 

That is 1/45 o f an atmosphere.


In o ther words , if th is can kept its vo lume and d idn' t imp lode, by the  time it reaches 20 degrees

centigrade, the pressure in here would be on ly a few percent of one a tmospheric pressure , so it's

like hav ing a vacuum in there.


And so clearly, the can will implode .


So we'll try to ge t the wa ter out, to ge t it to bo il.


I think  it is boiling .


I have to make sure tha t all the a ir is ou t.


I rea lly want pure wa ter vapor in there .


Yeah , looks good .


Looks fine.


There it goes .


So now , the vapor pressure goes down, the gas--


if you want to call it the gas , which is what it is--


condenses into liquid , because a t lower temperature , it will s tart  to condense .


And wha t it does , it's going to wa lk down this  line.


Ah ! The water  is boiling ! You see that? Wa ter  is boiling.


20 degrees cen tigrade.


Water  is boiling--


okay, so we've seen tha t.


Let's go back to the ... 

Shall we go back to wa ter? We star ted with bo iling wa ter here at one a tmosphere , 100 degrees 
centigrade. 

As the temperature goes down , it must stay on th is line , because wa ter and liquid ...


liquid and  the vapor are in  thermal equilibrium with each other, and as  it comes down this  line,

you see the pressure goes down and down and down.


And by the time tha t it is 20 degrees cen tigrade, we would be back at  that 17 millimeters mercury.


Now, if this can is  leaking, which  I think  it is , because it should already have collapsed...


If the can is  leaking, o f course , then  that wou ld be a d ifferent story.


Then it will not do wha t we want it to do.


So I may have  to try this again .


So , we do it again with ano ther can .


See , tha t already should have imploded.


So we'll boil this one .


Be a little pa tien t, and we will try  it aga in.


Yeah .


In the mean time, I wan t to challenge you a little bit and expose you to a demons tration which is

kind o f b izarre, and I wan t you to te ll me why  it doesn't behave the way I wan t it to behave.


I have ba lloons , small balloons here, which are filled with a ir, and I'm going to put  them in liquid

nitrogen.


So they have a certain volume .


I don't care what  that volume is .


They are a t room temperature , which is 293 degrees , and the pressure ins ide is very c lose to one

atmosphere .


There's a lmost no overpressure in those balloons.


I'm going to make the tempera ture 77 degrees Kelvin , which is  liquid nitrogen .


The pressure will rema in very closely one atmosphere.


I think balloons don' t have very much overpressure , no matter wha t you do with them.


And so I want  to know what the volume is , how much they're going to shrink.


Well, I apply the ideal-gas  law and the number o f mo lecules is not go ing to change , R  is no t going

to change , so the new volume is going to be the old volume times the new tempera ture divided by

the old temperature .


And so tha t is the old volume times 77 divided by 293 , if the idea l-gas  law holds .


And that is one-quar ter of V1.


So the volume becomes four  times less .


If the volume is four times  less, then the radius becomes 60% of wha t it originally was, because R

cubed goes with the volume .


So R2 is about 60% o f R1 , so it should be very no ticeable.


A balloon this big should become  this big .


What you will see , however, is someth ing very different.


Okay, I th ink we are okay on this one now .


We'll try to pu t the cap back on , if  I can find the cap .


Oh, yeah , there it is .


Now, let me tighten it a little be tter than I did the firs t time.


And le t's see now  if it cools...


whether  it does be tter.


Clearly, the o ther one was never properly sealed .


So , here we have the balloons, and I'm going  to dip them in liquid n itrogen.


Come on , can .


It would be qu ite a coincidence if that one is also leaking.


Normally, they collapse in seconds.


This one doesn't wan t to collapse.


[can clanks]


There it goes .

There it goes .


It's making obscene noises--


there it goes , there it goes.


Good!


[can clanking ]


You will see that--


look a t the balloons .


Whew! Here's a balloon.


And here is a ba lloon .


Anyone's bir thday today here? Must be someone .


200 kids--


not k ids, 200 grown-ups .


Someone must be ... birthday.


50% chance--


no one's bir thday? Hard to be lieve .


Okay, so  I predict that if I put it in liquid n itrogen, which  I have here , that the rad ius w ill become

60% o f what it was.


So it shrinks a little--


there we go.


And wha t you see is some thing very , very differen t, and that I wan t you to explain.


And you have all the tools available .


Keep in mind , I put it in liquid n itrogen--


remember tha t when you're looking  for a solu tion.


Okay, there's almost no volume le ft.


It's  like a fla t pancake--


it's noth ing.


Now it comes up , o f course, because now  it goes back  to room temperature .


[can clanks,  cla tters on to floor]


My goodness, it's having a hard time there .


Why is  it no t...


[balloon pops]


[class laughs]


Why is  it no t one-quar ter? Why  is it so much sma ller than wha t you expect? I' ll do one more .


If you come here--


why don' t you come here?--


you will see  that it is no thing.


The vo lume is e ffec tively zero.


You see tha t? Don' t be worried.


[class laughs]


And now  it comes up.


Last question for you to th ink about  this weekend .


I have here a can with tenn is ba lls, and when you open th is can , as everyone knows who plays

tennis , you hear...


[makes whoosh ing sound ]


When you go to Europe and you buy co ffee , and you open the coffee can, you hear ...


[makes whoosh ing sound ]


Peop le like tha t;  they think that's good .


A little bit of vacuum in there , or some thing like  tha t, makes the co ffee s tay longer , be tter, fresher.


Baloney, bu t it doesn' t ma tter .


In any case , these tennis balls , in the same tradition , you open it up and you hear...


[makes whoosh ing sound ]


Now comes the ques tion for you : Is the pressure inside the can higher than one a tmosphere? Or

is it lower? It cannot be the same , because then you wouldn't hear...


[makes whoosh ing sound ]


And if so , why wou ld the pressure inside be different? And I'll g ive you one clue, and the clue is

crucial.


You open  the can, you don' t p lay with the balls , you wait two days, and the balls are useless.


You can't play with them anymore .


That shou ld g ive you a clue .


Think abou t it--


think abou t the liquid nitrogen balloons .


Have a good weekend--


see you Monday.
