Transcript â€“ Lecture 24 

With our knowledge of torque...


calm down .


With our knowledge of torque and angular momen tum, we can now attack ro lling ob jects which

roll down a slope.


For ins tance , the follow ing ...


I have here a cylinder or  it could be a sphere , for tha t matter , and th is angle is beta .


I pre fer not  to use a lpha because that's angular acceleration , and there is this friction coefficien t

with the sur face, mu, and  this objec t is going to roll down and you're going to get an accelera tion

in this direction, a .


And I will eva lua te the situation when we have pure roll.


That means the ob ject is not skidding and is no t slipp ing.


What is pure ro ll?


If here is an object, the cylinder is here with radius R, and I'm going to rota te it like this and roll it

in this direction,  the center  is called po int Q.


Once it has made a comple te rota tion , if  then the po int Q has moved over a dis tance 2pi R, then

we call that pure roll.


When we have pure roll, the ve locity o f this poin t Q, and the ve locity o f the circumference , if you

can read that-- I'll just put a c there-- are the same.


In o ther words , vQ is then exac tly the same as v circumference , and v circumference is always 
omega R . 

This part always holds , but for pure roll, th is ho lds.


You can easily  imagine  tha t if there is no fric tion here , that the ob ject could be standing still,

rotating like crazy, but Q would not go anywhere .


So then we have skidding and we have slipping and then we don' t have the pure roll situation .


If the object is skidding or slipp ing,  then the friction mus t a lways be a maximum here .


If the object is  in pure roll, the fric tion could be subs tan tially  less than the maximum friction

possible.


Now I wou ld like to calculate with you the accelera tion  that a cylinder would ob tain .


When it pure rolls down that slope, it has mass M, it has leng th l and it has radius R.


And I wou ld like you to use your  in tuition and don't be a fraid that it's wrong .


I'm going to roll down  this  incline  two cylinders.


They're both solid, they have  the same mass, they have the same leng th bu t they're very different

in radii and I'm going to have a race between these two .


Which one will reach the bo ttom first? So I repea t the problem.


Two cylinders, bo th so lid , same length , same mass, bu t one has a larger radius than the o ther .


There's going to be a race.


We're go ing to roll  them down, pure roll.


Which one will will? Win win? W ill win? Who thinks that the one with the largest radius will w in?

Who thinks the large w ith  the smallest radius will w in? Who thinks there w ill be no winner , no

loser? Wow, your  intuition is better than mine was .


We'll see how  it goes .


Keep in mind wha t your vo te was and you will see it come out very shor tly .


Okay, let's pu t a ll the  forces on  this object  tha t we know .


This one is Mg.


And we're going  to decompose tha t into one a longer slope, which is Mg sine be ta , and one

perpendicular to the slope .


We have done tha t a zill... zillion times now .


And th is one equals Mg cosine be ta .


Then there is righ t here a normal  force, and the magnitude o f tha t normal force is Mg cosine be ta,

so there is no accelera tion in this d irection and then we have a frictional  force here for which I will

write F of f.


There is an angular velocity a t any momen t in time , omega, which will change with time, no

doubt.


And then this cen ter po int Q, which is the cen ter o f mass, is going to get a velocity v and that v

will also change with time .


And the v of  the poin t Q which changes with time is v of the circumference, because  that is the

condition of pure roll.


That equals omega R .


This  is always true, bu t this  is only true when it is pure roll.


I take the  time derivative.


The derivative o f the velocity of  that po int Q is , per de finition, its accelera tion, so I get a equa ls

omega do t times R, and that equals a lpha R, alpha being the angular accelera tion.


So th is is the cond ition for pure roll.


Now I'm going to take the torque about point Q.


When I take the torque about point Q, N has no effec t because it goes through Q, and g has no

effec t because it goes through Q, so there's only one force tha t adds to the torque .


If th is rad ius is R,  the magnitude is RF and the direction is  in the blackboard.


Bu t I'm on ly in teres ted in the magnitude for now, so I get R  times the fric tiona l force.


This mus t be  I a lpha , I being  the momen t of iner tia for rotation abou t this axis through poin t Q,

times a lpha , but I can replace alpha by a /R.


So I ge t the moment o f inertia about Q  times a /R.


And th is is my first equa tion , and I have as an unknown the  frictional force, and I have as an

unknown a, and so I canno t solve  for bo th .


I need another equa tion .


The next equa tion tha t I have is an obvious one, that is Newton's second law : f = MA.


For the center o f mass,  I can consider all the mass righ t here a t Q.


We must have f = MA.


And so M times the acceleration of that point Q, which is our goal, by the way , equals this

component, equals Mg sine be ta .


That is the component downhill.


And minus Ff, the frictional force, which is the component uphill, and this is my equation number

two.


Now I have  two equa tions with two unknowns .


So I can so lve now.


I can eliminate Ff and I will substitu te for Ff in here this quantity divided by R.


And so I get Ma equals Mg sine beta minus moment of  inertia about point Q,


times a divided by R squared .


And now no tice tha t I've eliminated F o f f, and so now I can solve for a .


So I'm going to get...


I bring the a's to one side .


So I ge t a times M plus momen t of iner tia divided by R squared equals Mg sine beta , and a now

we have .


I multip ly bo th sides with R squared . 

I ge t MR squared g sine be ta upsta irs, and downs tairs I get MR squared plus the momen t o f 
inertia about that po int Q. 

This  is my result, and a ll I have to pu t in now  is the momen t o f iner tia of ro tation abou t tha t ax is. 

I want to remind you , though, that it is on ly true if we have a situa tion o f pure ro ll. 

So we can now subs titute in  there the values tha t we have for a solid cylinder. 

If we have a solid cylinder , then the momen t of iner tia about th is axis 

through the center of mass, which I've called Q, equals 1/2 MR squared . 

And if I subs titute tha t in here, no tice tha t all my M's... 

MR squares go away. 

I ge t 1 + 1 /2 , which is 1 1 /2. 

Upside down becomes 2 /3 . 

So a = 2 /3 times g times the sine o f beta. 

There is no M, there is no l and there is no R . 

So if  I have  two cylinders, solid cylinders w ith tota lly d ifferent mass , to tally different radii, to tally

differen t length and they have a race , neither one wins.


Very nonin tuitive .


Every time tha t I see it I find it kind o f amaz ing.


Notice that everyth ing disappears.


M, R and l disappear.


So those o f you who said tha t if I take  two cylinders w ith the same mass, differen t radii, those o f

you who said that there is no winner, there is no loser , they were correct.


Bu t even more amazing is tha t even the mass you can change.


You can change anything as  long as the two cylinders are solid .


That's wha t ma tters.


So if we take a hollow cylinder , then the momen t of iner tia abou t this axis through the cen ter o f

mass, through Q, if th is...


if really mos t of the mass  is really a t the surface, then it's very close to MR squared, and  then the 
acceleration--

if I substitu te in here MR squared , I ge t a 2 there-- equals 1 /2 times g times sine beta . 

So th is accelera tion is  less than this one .


So the ho llow cylinder will lose in any race against a so lid cylinder regardless of mass, regardless

of radius, regard less o f leng th.


And I wan t to show tha t to you .


We have a setup here and I'll try to show that  to you also on the screen there, bu t for those o f you

who are sitting close , it's probably much be tter


that you jus t look a t the demons tration righ t here.


I have here ... ooh .


Uh-uh.


I have here  to s tart with a very heavy cylinder made of brass and th is one is made of aluminum.


They have very differen t masses , same radii, same length.


Shou ld make no difference.


There should be no winner , there shou ld be no loser.


I'm going to star t them off at the same time .


I hope you can see that there.


This  is... th is is the s tarting poin t.


Can lower it a little .


I will count down three to zero , and then you can see that they reach the bo ttom almos t a t the

same time .


So very different in mass.


The mass difference is at least a factor o f three .


All o ther dimensions are the same.


Three,  two, one , zero.


Complete ly in un ison.


Not intuitive for me .


Now I have one tha t has a very small radius compared  to this one .


This  is a sm... sma ll aluminum rod.


Maybe you can see it here, television.


This  is way more heavy, almost 30 times heavier.


Shou ld make no difference.


As long as it's so lid , shou ld make no difference.


No winner, no loser.


Radii are d ifferen t, masses are different.


Shou ld make no difference.


Okay? Here we star t the race.


Three,  two, one , zero.


And they hit the bo ttom a t the same time .


Bu t now here  I have a hollow one , and you be tter believe it, tha t it's hollow .


So now all the mass  is a t the circumference, and now  it takes more time .


Now the acceleration as you w ...


as you w ill see , is half times g sine beta ; in the o ther case it was 2/3.


And you may wan t to th ink about it ton igh t, why this one takes more.


It has to do , o f course, with the moment o f inertia, bu t again, it's independent o f mass, rad ius and

length.


So it's purely a ma tter o f geometry .


This one is go ing to be the loser, and this one, regard less of mass or  leng th, is going to be the

winner.


So you see  them.


One is ho llow , one is no t.


This  is very  ligh t; this is very heavy.


I'll pu t the hollow one on your side .


Three,  two, one , zero.


The hollow one lost and even fe ll on the floor.


Yeah , I find these things always quite amaz ing,  tha t na ture works this way, and I'm impressed

that most o f you or many o f you had the righ t intuition when they said it wou ld make no difference

for the two solid cylinders.


We now come to the mos t nonin tuitive part o f a ll of 8 .01 and arguably perhaps the most difficult

part in all of physics and tha t has to do with gyroscopes .


And I really urge you to pay a lo t o f atten tion and no t even to miss ten seconds , because you're 
going to see some mind-boggling demonstra tions which are so incredibly nonintu itive  tha t un less 
you have fo llowed the steps that lead up  to it, you won't have any  idea wha t you're looking at. 

It will be  fun , it will be cute, bu t it won' t do any thing for you.


Imagine that you and I go in ou ter space .


No gravity.


We're somewhere in ou ter space and we have this bicycle whee l there .


And I'm going  to put a torque on this bicycle wheel in  th is direc tion , so I'm going to put my right

hand towards you and my  le ft hand away from you .


And I'll do tha t for a shor t amount o f time and I'll let it go.


It's obvious wha t's go ing to happen.


This wheel is going to spin like this forever and ever and ever.


I've g iven it a little torque .


That means  if  there's torque , there's a change o f angular momentum.


The angular momentum change must be  torque times delta t.


And so I do this and le t it go and it w ill rota te abou t th is axis forever and ever and ever.


Simple , righ t? Okay.


Now I'm going to torque it in th is d irection.


So we're in outer space , wheel is s tanding s till and a ll I do is do this and  I let it go .


Then it will ro ta te forever and ever and ever and ever  in th is direc tion .


That's clear .


Now comes the very nonin tuitive part.


Now I'm going to give it a spin in your direction and now again I'm go ing to torque like th is.


What will now happen? You will say ...


or you might say.


I'm no t accusing you o f anyth ing.


You migh t say , we ll, you give the wheel a spin so this... the wheel will probably con tinue to spin

and you do this, so maybe wha t you're going to see is that it will ro ta te like th is as  it did be fore

and in the same  time the whee l w ill be spinning.


Bu t tha t cannot be because if the whee l would be sp inn ing like this , then the angular momentum

of the spinn ing wheel is  in th is direction.


And if I would give it a twist and if it would con tinue to spin and it would ro tate like this , then this 
spin angular momentum would go around like this and that canno t be because there's no torque 
on the system, because once I le t go, there is no longer any torque . 

So it is no t possible for the wheel to keep rotating, and as a resu lt o f this torque tha t I give it, tha t 
it simp ly goes around. 

That is no t possible . 

How is nature going to deal with tha t? I'll show you tha t on a view graph. 

It's very non intuitive what will happen . 

And we will  then also ... I will also demons trate it to you . 

So here is the situation precisely as I described it to you. 

You are, as an observer, in this d irection. 

This  is the direction of 26 .100 . 

So you are view ing the wheels  like this . 

They're spinning  towards you. 

That's wha t I will do shortly and tha t's wha t I implied now.


This  is my right hand and  this  is my  left hand .


The separation between my height... righ t and left hand is little "b." So the torque tha t I apply  is

bF, is this arm, so to speak,  times this force .


And the force is perpendicular to the arm.


I apply a torque for a certa in amount o f time-- delta t.


When I do tha t, I apply,  I add angular momentum in this direction.


Bu t the wheel was spinn ing in...


in... in th is d irection.


You see it.


And so the angu lar momen tum o f spin of  the wheel is  in th is d irection.


I add angular momentum in this d irection and you see that here.


So th is was originally the spin angular momentum of  the whee l.


I torque for time delta t, and so I add angular momen tum like this .


And then I stop .


I on ly torque for a short amoun t of time and I s top .


That means after I have stopped,  the angular momen tum o f the system as a who le can no longer 
change because there's no torque on the system, and the on ly way that na ture now can solve 
that prob lem is to tilt this whee l in the way I've indica ted here , and to make it sp in in this direc tion 
and it will stand s till. 

In o ther words , I hold it in my hand,  the wheel-- I will ge t it-- I give it a spin .


I ho ld it in my hand, I spin it towards you ...


and I'm go ing to pu t my r ight hand towards you and my  le ft hand away from you .


The sp in angular momentum is now  in th is direc tion , so I'm going to g ive it a torque like so .


That means up.


And wha t w ill the wheel do? The wheel will do this.


Very nonin tuitive .


Watch it.


Isn't that strange? You wouldn' t expect that.


I will do it aga in.


I'm going to torque by push ing my hand towards you , and the wheel does someth ing comp letely

unexpected .


It simply tilts.


If I torque the o ther way around , then the torque , of course, will make it flip like this .


I'll give it a little bit more spin angular momen tum, so now I move my  le ft hand  towards me and

my... towards you and my right hand towards me, and then I expect tha t the wheel will do this.


And that's wha t it does.


Extremely non intuitive.


These torques app lied to a spinn ing wheel always do some thing  that you don' t expect.


However, there is one thing that always helps me in terms o f guiding me and  that is you can

always pred ict tha t the spin angular momentum will always move in the direction of the torque ,

which is th is ex ternal  torque that I app lied .


Let's go over that aga in.


We have here  the sp in angular momen tum  that you saw.


It was poin ting in this d irection.


And I app lied the torque in  this direction,  the vec tor .


And wha t does the spin angu lar momen tum do? It goes in the direction o f the torque .


And then when I stop with my torque , then of course no thing changes anymore , and so wha t

happens  is this wheel tilts.


Bu t no tice that L , the spin angu lar momen tum, has moved from here to here .


And I was torqueing in this d irection, so it moved towards the  torque .


If you have diges ted th is, then you can tes t yourself now.


Now we have the same wheel.


I'm going to rota te it in exac tly the same direction, bu t now I'm no t go ing to  torque like th is, in the

Z direc tion , or  like this , in the minus-Z direc tion .


Now I'm going to do this .


Or I'm going to do this .


Try now to rea lly concentra te on what  I just taught you .


And try to give an answer to  the fo llowing question.


The wheel is ro ta ting .


I ho ld it in my hand and I'm going to  torque it like this so that the torque  factor  is  in your direction.


Angu lar momen tum goes like this , torque is  like th is.


What will the angu lar momen tum vec tor do? Move in the direc tion o f... o f the torque.


What will the angu lar...


what will  the sp in angular momen tum vector then do if  the torque is  in this direc tion? It will do  this.


It's going  to move in the horizon tal plane .


Very nonin tuitive , but that's wha t it will do .


And I will show tha t to you.


I'm going to spin th is wheel.


I'm going to spin it with a high angu lar momen tum, high spin angu lar momen tum.


And then I'm going to sit on this stoo l and I'm go ing to torque exac tly as you see on the pic ture on

the r igh t.


I'm going to torque like this .


And as  long as I torque it like th is, tha t spin angular momen tum wants to go around in  the

horizonta l p lane .


And when I  torque the o ther way around , it will go back  in the hor izonta l p lane .


I'm going to torque exactly as you see on the p icture there.


Are you ready? I s top the torque ; noth ing happens.


I torque backwards ; I keep torque ing.


I keep  torqueing.


I feel it in my hand .


I rea lly have to push.


I keep  torqueing.


And I stop torque ing and it stops.


The angular momentum vector is chasing , so  to speak, the  torque .


Is that nonin tuitive? Very non intu itive? It's also dangerous some times .


We call this mo tion o f the stool, and in this case, the motion o f the spinn ing wheel, we ca ll tha t

precession.


So you apply a torque  to a spinning whee l.


Then wha t you ob tain is a precession.


I can show you the precession in another way which is, in fac t, very intriguing .


Suppose  I have here a string, a rope , like we have  there.


And I stick in to tha t rope , I a ttach to the rope  this wheel, just like so.


And I le t it go .


Well, we all know what will happen .


Clunk.


It's clear.


All righ t.


Bu t now I'm go ing to spin it be fore I le t it go .


So here at the bottom, a t this poin t P, there is a loop .


And here is the ... the axis of ro tation of the bicycle wheel wh ich is solid brass, it's a solid p iece,

and I g ive tha t a length little "r," not to be con fused with capital "R," which is the radius of  the

bicycle wheel.


So th is is capital R.


And it can rotate about this here reasonably free ly.


I call tha t cen ter poin t Q and le t this be the par t of the wheel tha t is on your side .


I'm trying to make you see it a little bit  three-dimensionally.


Suppose now  I g ive it a sp in in this direc tion .


Omega s .


"S" stands for "spin." In wha t direction is now the spin angular momen tum? Use your hands, your 
thumbs. 

Spinning in th is d irection. 

Yeah . 

Spinning th is d irection, angu lar momen tum is in  this direction . 

That's a sp in angular momen tum. 

L spin .


Well, there is a force on this system, Mg, and that  force is in this direc tion .


It has a mass M, the bicycle wheel, and it has a radius , capital "R," and this part is  little "r." So

relative to poin t P,  there is a  torque and the torque is R times Mg .


This  is 90 degrees so the cross product is nice.


The sine of the angle is one.


So the  torque rela tive to po int P is r times M times g .


In what direc tion is that torque? R cross F.


In what direc tion is that torque? Use your hands , thumbs, wha tever you want.


You th ink  in this direc tion? I disagree.


I d isagree .


R cross F is...


you must be kidding.


In the blackboard.


It's not ou t of the b lackboard ; it's  in the blackboard.


R cross F is  in the blackboard.


There is a torque in th is direc tion .


Nature , grav ity provides tha t torque.


What will the spin angu lar momen tum do? It's going to move in the direc tion o f the torque .


It's going  to chase the torque.


So wha t will it do if the angu lar momen tum is here? What w ill it do? It will do this .


And as  it moves, the  torque will a lways be perpendicular to  the plane  through the s tring and r.


You can just see tha t for yourself why that is . 

At  this very moment when angular momen tum is like this, the torque is  in the b lackboard because 
it's r cross F. 

Bu t when I'm here , th is r has changed position , and always rema ins perpendicu lar to the wheel.


So the  torque will a lso change direction and so this angular momen tum, spin angu lar momen tum

will keep chasing the  torque and star t to rota te freely.


That is exactly wha t I was doing when  I was sitting on  the stool, excep t tha t I had to apply tha t

torque in my hands like  this.


It's exactly the same direc tion .


I had to apply  it a ll the time, and when  I s topped , the precession stopped .


Here, however , the torque w ill never stop because this Mg will always be there, and  I will show

that  to you shor tly.


You may say, "You mus t be crazy "because you're vio lating New ton's second law , f = MA.


"This ob ject go t to fa ll.


"There's on ly one force on tha t object.


"f = MA.


"How can it no t? The cen ter o f mass must fa ll w ith acce leration g ." Aha .


There is no t just one  force on tha t object.


What do you th ink is here? The tension in this cable , T, will be exac tly Mg .


And so the ne t, the sum of all forces on tha t object is zero.


There is no ne t force on tha t wheel bu t there is a net  torque, and that's why it's going to precess .


If there had been a net force, then indeed it would also go down, if  this force were larger than this .


So nature is very clever , the way that it deals w ith  these rather d ifficult problems.


Be fore I will show you this demons tration by spinning this whee l and then hanging it there in that

rope, um, I wan t to mention tha t the angular frequency of the precession , which should never be 
confused with the angu lar frequency o f spinning , is derived for you ... it's only a three- or four-
minu te job , on page 344 in your book. 

Now, I will no t derive it here bu t what comes out o f it, that it is the torque which is the one that we 
have here in this case , divided by the spin angular momen tum. 

That gives you the  frequency of the precession.


In our case , for our b icycle wheel, it is rMg and the spin angu lar momen tum o f this whee l, if it is

rotating with angular velocity omega o f s, would be I  times omega.


Remember , l is I times omega o f a spinning whee l.


So I have here I rotating about po int Q-- th is is the ax is of ro ta tion-- times omega of  the spin .


This  is the sp in and th is is the precession.


And then the period o f precession would be 2p i d ivided by omega precession.


Let's take a look at that equa tion and see whe ther that sort o f intuitively makes sense.


First of all, if you increase the torque, the upstairs , then it says tha t the precession frequency w ill

increase.


That makes sense  to me because the torque is persuading the angular momen tum to fo llow  it.


So the  torque is persuading the spin angu lar momen tum to change .


Well, if the  torque is s tronger then it is more powerfu l, so you expect that the precession

frequency will be higher.


However, if  the sp in angular momen tum is very powerful, then the spin angu lar momen tum says ,

"Sorry, torque, I'm no t go ing to go as fas t as you want me to go ." So when you increase tha t spin 
angular momentum in the wheel, it is a lso intu itive  that  the precession frequency will go down . 

As the whee l spins, it has spin angu lar momen tum, bu t as it precesses around like this, there w ill 
also be angular momen tum in this direc tion because it's rota ting like  this.


Therefore there is a total angular momen tum wh ich is the vectorial sum o f the two.


This equa tion will on ly ho ld as long as the sp in angular momen tum is really domina ting the to tal

angular momentum and you can see that immedia tely , because suppose you make the spin 
angular momentum zero, that it is no t sp inning a t all. 

Do you really th ink tha t the precession frequency will be in finitely high? Of course not.


So th is on ly ho lds in situa tions where the spin angular momen tum is way, way  larger than the

angular momentum tha t you get due  to the precession .


So there are restric tions .


When the ... when the wheel comes to a ha lt, when it's no longer ro ta ting , you better believe it,

then the thing will go clunk.


There's no longer the precession mode .


For our bicycle whee l, to ge t a fee ling for how  long the precession will take , uh, we can substitu te

the numbers in there , our bicycle wheel,  the... the ... the rod,  the brass rod , little r has a length o f

17 cen timeters, and the ... the rad ius o f the bicycle wheel is abou t 29 centime ters.


And le t me make the assumption tha t all the mass o f the bicycle whee l is a t the circumference ,

which is no t very accurate , but it's close  to tha t.


I mean , there are some spokes here , but le t's assume that everything is here , so then the

momen t o f inertia is MR squared .


Well, if now you take a frequency o f five hertz , sp in frequency, you can calculate now omega o f

the sp in frequency.


Omega equals 2pi times the sp in frequency.


And so I know now I can subs titute  tha t in there , so I ge t an omega precession now equals rMg

times the moment of inertia.


I assume that all  the mass  is a t the circumference, an approxima tion, so we ge t MR squared and

then we get omega S, which we have here .


We lose the M, and so we ge t rg div ided by omega s times R squared.


That is the angular frequency o f the precession , and the period o f the precession is 2pi divided by

omega and you find then for the period o f the precession abou t ten seconds .


So if  I gave it a spin frequency of  five hertz with these d imensions and w ith this approximation

that all the mass is at the circumference , you wou ld expect tha t it would precess around very

gently  in abou t ten seconds .


Bu t I have very  little con trol over tha t frequency, so it is possible I gave it seven hertz , it's possible

I gave it three her tz.


Bu t I w ill do wha t I can .


I'll actually give it the maximum one that I can .


That is always guaran teed success.


Where is the wheel? The wheel is here.


So we'll spin it up and then we'll put it in here .


Notice the way I'm spinn ing it.


I'm holding it away from me now and going  to change it and do it differen tly next.


And there it goes .


Abou t ten seconds .


Isn't that amazing? And it ro tates, seen from below , clockwise.


Now it's go ing th is way and I'm going to redo the experimen t, chang ing the direc tion o f ro ta tion ,

and then it will go the o ther way around.


And now the angular momentum is ro ta ting like  this, is pointing here.


Spin angular momen tum is poin ting like th is, torque is like th is, and so the spin angu lar

momen tum is changing tha t...


chasing tha t torque .


I am the spin angular momentum.


I am the torque .


This  is the torque.


It's chasing it.


All righ t.


So I have th is in my right hand .


That's all righ t.


And now I will... so when I spin it up, that's righ t.


So le t me now change the d irection.


I'm turning it over and I'm going to spin it up aga in.


Angu lar momen tum is now  in this d irection.


See , it's turn ing the o ther way around.


Angu lar momen tum is  in this d irection.


Torque is now towards me.


Angu lar momen tum is chasing  the torque.


I've changed the direc tion o f the spin angular momen tum.


I've no t changed  the direction of the torque , and now  it is rota ting , as seen  from be low,

counterclockwise .


Be fore, it was ro tating c lockwise.


If I can increase the torque by putting some weigh t here on the axle, I have this...


this actua lly ex tends , in our case , and I can put some weight on here , then  I ac tually add to the

torque and then you w ill see tha t it's ... it goes fas ter.


The precession frequency goes up .


So I will pu t some we ight on  there .


So le t it firs t go around, which was rough ly ten seconds , roughly ca lcula ted , and now I'm go ing to

put two kilograms here at  the end .


And now you will see an instantaneous  increase in the precession frequency .


You see it goes much faster now .


I take it o ff and then it goes back to its rough ly ten seconds.


So wha t I have done is I have increased this torque but not a t the expense o f M, because the

reason why the M cancels  is because  the momen t of inertia has an M in it, but if I just hang this

object on it, that doesn' t change the momen t o f inertia of the spinn ing wheel.


None o f this  is  in tuitive.


None o f this  is  in tuitive.


You can do all of  this w ith a $5 toy gyro.


And I wan t to show th is to you .


This  is my toy gyro .


I have it in my office .


It's great  fun .


And th is toy gyro is doing exac tly the same thing tha t th is is doing .


Let me show you the  toy gyro first.


Toy gyro .


Oh, yeah .


Here is a toy gyro.


Can you see it? Maybe I should make it a little darker here.


Can you see my toy gyro? Yeah? I'm going  to sp in it and then I'm going to hang it exactly the

same way tha t tha t was hanging .


I'm going to spin it, for those who are sitting c lose-- whoosh-- and then putting it horizon tally and

hanging it in a str ing, and you'll see exac tly the same th ing is happening .


And now through fric tion , of course, all this fun u ltima tely comes to a halt.


I have some thing very special for you, or I may have something very special for you.


That depends on my helper who is here behind the scenes.


I hear h im.


He's there.


Great.


Did you ge t full speed?


I'm going to the a irport and ge t a little tired and ask one of my friends to he lp me .


Would you please help me and just carry this suitcase  for me around? Pick it up, walk around a

little , make some turns.


Turn the other way around, please.


[laughter ]


STUDENT: What the hell? LEW IN: What the hell, yeah.


Exactly .


What are you doing , man? You're behaving so s trangely.


Make some more turns , man .


We've go t to go the...


we've go t to catch the p lane .


It doesn' t quite do what you think it will be doing, righ t? So in here, you've guessed it.


STUDENT: Spinn ing wheel or someth ing.


LEW IN : Spinning whee l.


And when you do th is, you put a torque on it and it does exactly wha t you least expect: it flips up.


Isn't that fun? Yeah.


You may ge t arrested when you go to Logan Airport with th is suitcase .


Thank you very much .


It's great.


Spinning objec ts have a stabiliz ing effect.


If you take a bicycle wheel, and we have one, and  I put it here and  I do no thing, it w ill fa ll.


No one is surprised.


However, if  I g ive it a little spin , then it doesn' t fall.


Why? Because it has angular momen tum.


It has sp in angular momen tum.


And so it doesn' t fall.


And it is no t only a bicycle wheel.


Look.


Nicely stable .


Not only with a bicycle whee l.


You take ... you take a quar ter and you pu t a quarter  like th is on your desk.


You be t your  life it will fall.


Roll it; it becomes s table.


You give it spin angular momentum, it becomes s table .


Take a  top.


You pu t a  top on the table , falls over .


You tw ist it, you give it spin , and the top is stable .


So spin angular momen tum has the property of stabilizing things .


And you will see that addressed in one o f your assignments, when  I want you to address that

quantita tively .


This  is the basic  idea behind inertial guidance systems .


In inertial guidance systems , you have a spinn ing whee l, at leas t in the days tha t the gu idance

systems had mechanical whee ls.


You have a sp inning wheel, bu t that spinn ing wheel is moun ted in such a way that you canno t put

a torque on the axis of rotation of the spinning wheel.


That's the way  it's moun ted .


We call tha t three-axle-gimbaled gyros .


So the momen t tha t you pu t a torque on it, the housings-- in this case, the yellow and the b lack

housing-- w ill star t to rota te , and you never managed to get  tha t torque on the spinning wheel.


You never get it on... on  this axis.


And therefore , if now you pu t it on your boat or you put  it in a p lane , or a missile for that matter, if

you can never put a torque on the spinning wheel and if the angu lar momen tum for sp in is in  this

direction , it will s tay there  forever and ever, assuming that we have no frictional losses .


And if then the p lane turns, the direc tion o f the spin angular momen tum will not change, bu t what

will happen o f course is that th is yellow frame will ro tate or this black frame will ro tate .


And in these bearings here are sha ft encoders, and they sense tha t the rotation tha t the ou ter

housing makes  in order to keep this thing poin ting at  the same d irection.


And that signa l is being fed back to the automa tic pilo t and tha t keeps the plane flying in the

direction  tha t you wan t to .


So you use , as a re ference all the time , the spin angu lar momen tum of your gyro, which is now 
moun ted in such a way that you canno t put a torque on it, even when the p lane changes 
direction , and I wan t to show tha t to you . 

Okay, this  is the direc tion o f my sp in angular momen tum and I'm the airplane and I'm going to fly.


Look a t tha t sp in angular momentum.


It has no respect for me.


It stays  in the same direction no ma tter how I fly .


And the arrow signals tha t come from the bearings of the yellow housing and the black housing ,

those arrow signals are fed back to the au toma tic pilo t and so the p lane will stay on course . 

Now wha t I can do for you to come  to a fina l test on your th inking , this whee l is suspended in 
such a way that  there is no gravita tional torque on it like there was here . 

Bu t I can pu t a torque on it by simply putting some weights on  the axis. 

And wha t do you  think will happen now  if  I pu t some we ight here on the axis? So the wheel is 
spinning , but now I'm going to put a torque on it here . 

It is sp inning in this direction . 

Angu lar momen tum is pointing s traigh t at me, away from you . 

I'm going to pu t a torque on like th is, put a little weigh t there. 

Torque will be in this d irection. 

What will the spin angu lar momen tum do? Torque is  in  this direction;

spin angular momentum's  in this direc tion .


Spin angular momen tum will start to chase the torque .


Watch th is.


There it goes .


The sp in angular momentum is chasing the torque .


You see exactly the same th ing tha t I've shown you before.


And if I make the torque higher, then the precession  frequency will go up.


See , it stops now  immedia tely when I  take it o ff.


Pu t it back on again .


Continues.


Pu t more on it.


Goes way faster .


What happens now  if I pu t the weight on th is side? So I change the d irection of the torque .


If I pu t it on th is side, torque is now  in  this direction, spin angu lar momen tum is in  this direction.


It's going  to reverse direc tion .


There we go.


And you see it does .


Amazingly non intu itive.


If you have problems w ith  this, you're no t a lone .


See you Wednesday.
