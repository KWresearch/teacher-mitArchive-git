8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 27 

Today we're going to change topics .


I'm going to ta lk to you about  fluids , hydrosta tic pressure and barome tric pressure .


If, for now, we forget gravity  and  I would have a compartment closed off and filled with a flu id--


could be e ither a gas or it could be a liquid--


this has area A, here--


and I apply a force on it in th is d irection, then I apply a pressure.


Pressure is de fined as the force divided by area--


has units newtons per square meter  which is a lso called pascal.


One newton per square meter is one pascal.


Now, in the absence o f gravity , the pressure is, everywhere in  this vessel, the same .


And that is what's called Pascal's princip le.


Pascal's principle says tha t the pressure applied to an enclosed flu id is transmitted undiminished

to every point in the fluid and to the wa lls o f the con tainer.


Keep in mind , pressure is a scalar, it has no direc tion .


Force has a direction and the force exerted by the  fluid on any thing--


there fore a lso on the wall--


must be everywhere perpendicular to the wall, because if  there were any tangential componen t,

then the fluid would star t to move .


Action equals minus reaction, so it star ts to move and we are ta lking here abou t a s tatic fluid .


So if  I take any e lement--


I take one here at the sur face , little elemen t delta A and the  force mus t be perpendicular to tha t

surface, delta F, and so de lta F divided by de lta A--


in the limiting case for delta A goes to zero--


is, then , tha t pressure P.


This has some truly amazing consequences wh ich are by no means so in tuitive .


This  is the idea o f an hydrau lic  jack.


I have here a vessel which has a very peculiar shape .


Ooh, ooh , an opening here.


And le t there be here a piston on it with area A1 and here one with area A2 .


It's filled with liqu id everywhere and I apply here a force F1 and here a force F2 .


So the pressure that I app ly here is F1 divided by A1 .


So according to Pascal, everywhere in the fluid , tha t pressure must be the same.


For now , I jus t assume that the e ffect of gravity, which  I will discuss shortly , doesn't change the

situa tion very sign ificantly.


Bu t I w ill address the gravity very shortly .


So the pressure , then , will be the same everywhere , bu t the pressure due to th is side is F2

divided by A2 ...


and so the two mus t be the same, if the liquid is not moving.


So wha t tha t means  is tha t if A2 over A1 were 100 , it means that  this force could be a hundred

times less than tha t one .


In o ther words , I cou ld put on here a weigh t, a mass o f ten k ilograms, and here  I cou ld put 1 ,000

kilograms and it would be comple tely  in equilibrium.


That's no t so in tuitive .


This  is used in all garages.


What they do is , they pu t on  top of this--


if I blow that up here , so this  is this pla tform,  there's a rod here and on top of it is a car .


And someone pushes here and then this goes up .


The car goes up .


If I push here with a force a little bit more than ten kilograms--


so tha t would be 100 new tons--


this  level would go up .


And so your first though t may be, "Gee, isn't  that a violation o f the conservation of energy? Am  I

not getting some thing  for no thing?" Well, not really.


Suppose  I push this down over a dis tance d1 , then  the amoun t of fluid that  I d isplace--


that is , the volume , is A1 times d1 .


That  fluid ends up here .


So th is one will go up over a distance d2.


Bu t the same amoun t of  fluid  that leaves here adds there.


In o ther words , Al d1 must be A2  times d2 .


Now, if the force here is a hundred times  less than the force there, the work that I am doing on

the left side is F1 times d1 .


If the force here is a hundred times  less than that, the d istance tha t I move is a hundred times

larger than d2 , because A2 over A1 is 100 .


And so F1 d1 w ill be the same as F2 d2--


100 times lower force but over 100 times  larger dis tance, and so  the product is the same .


So the work tha t I do when I push this down I ge t back  in terms of gravitational po ten tia l energy

by lifting the car.


So if  I wanted  to move the car up by one me ter and if the ra tio is 100 to one I wou ld have to move

this down by 100 me ters.


That's a little b it impractical so  these hydraulic presses are designed in such a way tha t you can

just jack it like tha t and every time tha t you br ing it up , that liqu id flows back  in again in to th is side

of the hydraulic jack.


Bu t, indeed, you will have  to go e ffective ly 100 me ters,  then , for tha t car  to go up by one meter  if

the ratio is 100 to one.


Now, gravity , of course, has an effect on  the pressure in the fluid.


If you go down in to the oceans , we know  that  the pressure will go up , and that is the result of

gravity.


And I wou ld like to derive the pressure increase .


Let this be the d irection of increasing y , and I choose a  liquid element, so this is  in the liquid itself.


I can choose it in any shape  tha t I want to.


I just take a nice horizon tal slab .


And th is is area A so the bo ttom is also A.


And le t this be at he ight y plus delta y and this is a t height y .


And the pressure here is P y p lus delta y and the pressure here is P o f y .


And th is ob ject has a mass, de lta m, and the liquid has a density, rho , which could be a func tion

of y--

we will leave tha t open for now . 

And so this mass--

the mass that I have here--


is the volume  times the density.


And the volume is A--


this area--


times de lta y, and then times the density, which may be a func tion o f y .


So if now  I pu t in all the forces at work here, there is gravity, which is delta m times g in th is

direction .


Then I have a force upwards due to  the pressure o f the fluid .


That's wha t we want to evaluate.


It's always perpend icular to the sur faces.


We talked about that earlier.


So in th is side , it comes in like this and here it comes  in like th is, the force.


From the bottom, it comes  in like th is and from  the top ,  I call this F2 .


I on ly consider the vertica l d irection, because all forces  in the horizon tal plane w ill cancel, for

obvious reasons.


So , now, there has to be equilibrium.


This flu id e lemen t is no t going anywhere--


it's just sitting still in the fluid.


And so I now have tha t F1--


which is  in th is d irection--


minus F2 minus delta mg must be zero.


Only then is the  fluid element in sta tic equilibrium.


Bu t F1 is this pressure times the area--


so tha t is P at leve l y times the area, and F2 is P a t level y plus delta y times the area, minus

delta m is A delta y times rho, so I ge t minus A times delta y, which could be a function...


rho could be a function o f y times g , and tha t equals zero.


Notice I lose my area .


I'm going to rearrange this sligh tly and d ivide by delta y .


And so I get that P at the level y plus delta y minus the pressure at leve l y divided by delta y

equals--


if I switch that around, so I bring th is to the o ther s ide--


equals minus rho y times g.


And if I take the limiting case o f this--


for delta y goes to zero--


then we would call  this dP/dy .


And th is tells you tha t when you go to increasing values of y, that the pressure will go down, it's a

minus sign .


Very natura l.


If you go w ith decreas ing va lues of y, then the pressure will go up .


And we call th is hydros tatic pressure .


So it's due to the fac t tha t there is gravity ; without gravity, there is no hydros tatic pressure .


Now, mos t flu ids, most liqu ids are prac tically  incompressible.


In o ther words , the density o f the liquid canno t really change.


And so there fore , you could remove th is and simply always use the same density .


It's exceeding ly d ifficult.


It takes horrendous forces and pressures to change the density o f a liquid, unlike tha t o f a gas.


A gas is compressible and you can very easily change  the density o f gas.


So liqu id is incompressib le.


If I have here a piston and I have here a liquid and  I put a force on here, it would be impossible

for me to make tha t volume smaller--


even by a fraction of a percent, it wou ld be impossible .


If th is, however , were gas, then it would be very easy for me to push tha t in and to change  the

volume , make  the vo lume smaller and thereby make the density of the gas go up .


If I took a sledgehammer and I would hit a plastic pillow , just bang , and the pillow was filled with 
air, it acts  like a cushion and I could squeeze it. 

If I hit the sledgehammer on  the marb le floor, I could no t squeeze it and the force on the marble 
floor and on the hammer would be way higher , because I don' t have this cushion ac tion . 

If I take a pa int can--

and we have one here , we have two--

and this pain t can is filled  to the brim with wa ter and another one is filled with a ir and I h it it w ith a 
sledgehammer, then this acts  like a cushion . 

This one, however, doesn' t want the vo lume to be decreased, so the force , like on the marble

floor , would be way h igher .


Bu t remember tha t force divided by area is pressure, and according to Pascal, that pressure

propagates undiminished in the whole  fluid .


And so if I wou ld shoot a bullet through here,  then I ge t a huge  force--


extremely small area o f the bullet.


And so the pressure inside the liquid would go up enormously , and the can might explode,

provided tha t it's really filled  to the brim with wa ter , because if there is air  left, then you have this

cushion ac tion .


Now, I don' t remember whe ther there's air  in here or whether there's air  in there.


I'll leave you to decide.


So we'll fire a bu lle t from this side , and then we'll see which can explodes and wh ich does not.


And the one tha t doesn't is the one tha t has air  in it, and the one tha t explodes ...


has the wa ter  in it, provided  tha t we really filled it to the brim.


Oh, boy,  there's s till some thing in  there.


[blow ing]


Okay.


I d id some thing wrong, bu t tha t's okay .


All righ t,  there goes the bu lle t.


Okay, are we ready for this? So you tell me wh ich can is filled with a ir and which can is filled with

water.


Three,  two, one , zero.


[gunsho t]


Okay, this one is closed .


It has a n ice hole here and a n ice hole there.


And th is one has a hole here and a hole there , but you saw the top come o ff.


So we know wh ich one had water  in it and by the way, it's still there.


These things are no t so in tuitive .


I will assume  from now on that liquids are comp lete ly incompressible .


In o ther words , I can now use this law tha t we have there and do a very simple in tegra tion .


I have now dP, wh ich I can integrate from some va lue P1 to P2.


This  is y, leve l P2 , level y2, level y1 , pressure P1 in the liqu id, and tha t equals now minus rho g

dy, integrated  from y1 to y2.


So tha t's now a trivial in tegra l because rho is constant--


rho is not a function o f y .


With the atmosphere o f the Earth , tha t's more difficult, because rho is a func tion o f a ltitude with

the atmosphere bu t not with liquids.


And so we ge t that P2 minus P1 equals minus rho g  times y2 minus y1, and this  is called Pascal's

law.


I pre fer to write it sligh tly differently, but it's the same thing.


I write a plus s ign here, so I switch  these around : rho g  times y2 minus y1 .


So wha t it means is I see immedia tely that if y2 minus y1 is positive--


this  is higher than this--


that  the pressure a t P1 is  larger than the pressure at P2, but o f course they are comple tely

identical, so th is is the hydros ta tic pressure .


This has qu ite bizarre consequences.


Suppose  I had a vessel that I filled w ith a liqu id.


It had a rather changed shape, like so ...


a rather s trange shape .


So I would fill it with liquid  to this  level, and the level here is y2 .


And le t's take the bo ttom o f this vessel and ca ll this y1.


And so inside here we have pressure P1 and righ t there, we have pressure P2.


Well, what Pascal is saying now  is that the pressure here is everywhere the same because y2

minus y1 is the same  for a ll these points here .


And so you will say , "Well, tha t is sor t o f intuitive." You will say , "Look, if I take here a co lumn--


"nicely cylindr ical ver tical column , which has area A, "and I call this separa tion h,  for simplicity--


"then the weight o f tha t co lumn--


"that's the we igh t o f the liquid--


"would be the area times h--


that's the vo lume--


times the density o f the liquid , rho, times g ." And so you would say , "That's a force ." The weigh t... 
the bottom here has to carry that weight and so the pressure at the bottom is that weight divided 
by the area , so tha t is rho hg . 

So you would say, "Tha t's very clear." Yeah , maybe , bu t how about here?

The pressure is the same , it couldn' t be any d ifferen t.


If the pressure were different here , then  the liqu id would star t to flow.


Bu t here you don' t have tha t co lumn h over you.


You only have it here .


And how abou t here? The consequence of Pascal's law is tha t if you had a vessel like this and

you filled it all the way with liqu id,  that  the pressure here at  the bottom would be exactly the same

as th is vessel, wh ich is filled w ith liquid all  the way to the bo ttom.


And yet the weigh t of th is is way more  than the we ight of this .


Bu t ye t, according  to Pascal's  law , the pressure differential is the same .


It is not in tuitive .


We live a t the bo ttom o f an ocean o f air.


So here's the Earth and here's air .


And when we go up in y, then we also expec t tha t the pressure will go down .


It doesn' t go down linear ly, like liqu ids do.


Liquids are linear because rho doesn' t change .


In the case of air , the density does change w ith altitude .


Bu t if I can take one square cen timeter cylinder all the way to  the top o f the a tmosphere just like I

did here, in the liquids ...


I take a one square cen time ter--


I cou ld have taken area A--


and I we igh all this a ir, then I would ge t the righ t answer for the pressure here , because I do tha t

there and that works, so tha t should work here.


And wha t I find, then...


then I find tha t at  the bottom... a t sea level,  I find rough ly one kilogram force , which is ten

newtons , per square cen time ter.


It means,  then , tha t this whole column ...


If I take a one square cen timeter tubing a ll the way to the top of the a tmosphere--


a few hundred kilome ters--


that  tha t would weigh one kilogram on ly, all that air .


One kilogram per square cen time ter.


If you convert that to newtons per square me ter , then you ge t roughly ten to the  fifth pascal.


And that is ca lled , generally, one atmosphere.


It's called  the atmospher ic pressure .


So the air pushes down on us--


that gives us the a tmospheric pressure--


not unlike the way tha t liquid pushes down because o f its weight and increased pressure as you

go down.


This a tmospheric pressure is a lso o ften ca lled barome tric pressure.


The idea of a barome ter.


Here's my hand , and my hand has an area of roughly 150 square cen timeters.


Force is always perpendicular to  the sur face .


I d iscussed that several  times.


For each square cen timeter, there is an equiva len t we ight of one kilogram due  to the air above

me.


That means 150 kilograms  is pushing down on my hand.


Why is my hand no t going down? Well, because there's also 150 kilogram pushing up.


And so, I  feel very comfortab le.


I don't even no tice it that there is this huge force in  this direction and this huge force in  that

direction .


So how can I measure this atmospher ic pressure if I can't feel it?

The way tha t you can measure it is by the following experimen t.


You take liquid , and you put a hose in the liquid , as I will do very shor tly .


This  is cranberry  juice , and this  is the hose .


And we're going  to immerse the hose comple tely  in to that liquid so that it's comple tely filled with

the liqu id.


And then we lift it ou t, and as we lift it ou t, we will see that the liquid will s tay there .


It's the barome tric pressure tha t's pushing it in .


And I pull it ou t and pull it ou t and pull it out and pu ll it out and there comes a  time tha t it will not

stay in  there anymore.


So it's way down there now, the vessel, and then it le ts go.


And th is is now empty , and here is the liqu id.


And th is is a way tha t we can measure the barome tric pressure and I will show you shor tly how

that works.


Bu t let me first convince you that if I let all  this cranberry juice inside the tub ing that I have ...


I pu t my finger on top o f the tubing and  I lift it ou t.


Notice that the cranberry juice stays there.


It's not runn ing down .


It's only when I take my finger o ff  the top--


[whooshes ]


then it goes down.


Bu t as  long as I hold my finger on  the top , it isn' t going down.


If my hose were long enough--


and we will know shor tly how  long--


it turns ou t to be more than ten meters--


then we would see the cranberry break  loose from the  top.


And th is is a way tha t you can measure the a tmospheric pressure and I w ill now be more

quantita tive abou t tha t.


I will leave this equation because I like that equation.


So imagine  tha t we have this experiment--


which in the old days wasn't done with plas tic hoses, which was done with glass tubes--


and suppose I end up here w ith liquid and here with such a tube and  tha t the liqu id had broken,

so it's empty here ...


and here is the liquid .


This  is y1 , this  is y2 , this  is the pressure P1 and right inside here is the pressure P2 which is zero ,

because it's emp ty, there is no thing.


A little bit of vapor pressure, bu t tha t's very sma ll.


And so this dis tance here...


let tha t be h.


And so now what is the pressure here at P1 which , o f course, is the barometric pressure? It's just

exposed to the a tmosphere .


Well, P1 minus P2 equals rho o f the liquid times g , times y2 minus y1, which is h.


Bu t P2 is zero , so P1 equa ls rho gh and that is the barometr ic pressure .


So all I have to do is take a liquid , know the density o f the liquid , measure how  far I have to pull

that hose up be fore the liquid breaks  loose , and then  I know wha t the barome tric pressure is .


Now, this was done in the early days,


in the 17th cen tury by Torricelli.


He used mercury and he found that...


Mercury, by the way, has a density o f 13.6  times ten to  the third kilograms per cubic me ter .


So th is is mercury .


He found that h is about 76 cen timeters--


0.76 meters .


This  is a fac t.


It changes a little b it from day to day .


It could change by a few cen timeters--


a little down , a little up.


If it's up , the barome tric pressure is higher than when it's down .


And so the barome tric pressure , P1 , is then 13 .6 times  ten to the third times g--


for wh ich I will take ten--


and the height is 0 .76 , and that is 1.03  times ten to  the fifth pascal...


which comes very close to the one-kilogram force per square cen time ter tha t I men tioned to you

earlier.


One a tmosphere's pressure is de fined in a very spec ial way  in a very precise way--


namely , tha t it is exactly the pressure when the column here is 760 millimeters o f mercury.


Then we ca ll the pressure here--


that's the definition--


one a tmosphere .


Now you can do the same experiment with water, whereas we tried to do it with cranberry ju ice.


The density o f water  is 13.6  times lower than  that o f mercury, so the column has to be 13 .6 times

higher than 76 cen timeters, which is about  ten me ters. 

So you would have to raise this thing up  to ten meters before you would see the break .


Bu t you wou ld have...


then you've built yourself a water barome ter .


If you do it with mercury , you have a mercury barometer.


You would see this  level go down .


And if the pressure is high, the weather is good ; and if  the pressure is low, the weather is no t so

good.


So you cou ld build yourself a water barome ter--


has to be  ten me ters  long .


The s tory has it tha t Pascal, who was French , d id the whole thing w ith red wine .


So he had a red wine barometer .


It's very good to remember that ten me ters o f water produces a hydrosta tic pressure o f one

atmosphere .


So if you go down in to the oceans by 100 me ters , then  the hydrosta tic pressure increases by ten

atmosphere .


So every ten me ters  is one a tmosphere .


Cornelis Van Drebbel--


and I know how  to pronounce that name because I'm Dutch; he was a Du tch inven tor--


is usually credited with build ing the  first submarine in the very ear ly 17 th century, around 1622 .


And he successfully opera ted this submarine a t a depth of about five me ters.


Imagine , five meters .


The hydrosta tic pressure there is half an a tmosphere.


Ten me ters, one a tmosphere--


five me ters, ha lf an atmosphere.


Nowadays, submarines go ...


It's a little secret how  far they go, bu t they have gone up to 3 ,000 feet, which is 900 me ters,

where the hydrosta tic pressure is 90 a tmospheres.


On every square me ter of  that submarine, if it is a t 900 meters, there is a force of 900  tons--


900,000 kilograms.


Now, Van Drebbel's submarine was an enormous accomplishmen t for the 17th cen tury, because

how are you going  to seal a vessel whereby the inside of the vessel is one a tmosphere--


that's the air tha t he was brea thing--


is five me ters be low the leve l, and so the ou tside pressure is one and a half a tmosphere?

Namely , one atmosphere barome tric pressure and half an a tmosphere from the hydros tatic

pressure.


So there's an overpressure on the vessel of half an atmosphere.


So tha t means on every square centime ter , there is a force poin ting inwards o f half a kilogram--


the equiva lent o f half a kilogram weight.


Force is always perpendicular to  the sur face , and if you would  take two square meters of his

submarine, that would be a force o f 10,000 kilograms.


It's amazing tha t he managed to do tha t and tha t he could ac tually operate his submarine

successfully.


I can show you here in 26.100 what kinds o f forces Van Drebbel was dealing with.


You see there in  front o f you a pain t can.


And I'm going  to evaporate the ...


not evapora te,  I'm going to evacua te the paint can.


I'm going to pump the air ou t.


And so here is the pain t can , abou t 25 centime ters by 15.


And so it has equilibrium--


there's one atmosphere ou tside , one atmosphere inside.


Pain t can is happy.


I'm going to suck the air out, so I ge t an underpressure here.


In o ther words , the pressure outside is higher than inside--


exactly the problem that Van Drebbe l had.


The pressure ou tside is higher than inside .


You ge t an imp losion .


He managed to counter that, to bu ild it strong enough .


When we take out  the air here, you can argue , we ll,  then, the overpressure is rea lly one

atmosphere and he only dealt with half an a tmosphere.


Well, before we reach this to be a vacuum, be lieve me , it already imp lodes .


So the  forces tha t we're dea ling with are very comparable to what Van Drebbe l was dea ling with

when he bu ilt h is submarine .


And so this can will star t to crumble when we take the air ou t, and  tha t's ano ther way of really

seeing the a tmospheric pressure.


So I take  the pressure ou t of  the inside and  the can w ill literally be squeezed because o f the

ocean o f air tha t is hanging on us and is push ing down on us.


Okay.


It has to be properly sealed, which is always a b it of a problem.


And so I have here a vacuum pump, and le t's pump on it.


[can buckling ]


You can already hear the crushing.


The force on the  front cover alone ...


this  is 375 square cen time ters.


If the pressure inside were zero , tha t would be a force of 375 kilograms.


Bu t look--


it's not very happy, that can.


And these are  the k ind of forces very comparab le to what Van Drebbel was dealing with in the 
17th century, and he was ab le to even opera te his submarine under these forces , without 
collapse. 

Okay, I th ink we ... 

you wan t to take  this as a souvenir? Oh, no , I can' t give tha t to you . 

We have  to first  take this off, but you can p ick it up later . 

That... that mouthpiece is quite prec ious for us, because we have to use tha t again, of course . 

So you see wha t tremendous forces are a t s take when you dea l with barome tric pressure . 

If you go scuba d iving , you go to a dep th of  ten me ters--

could you stick a tube in your mou th, which could go all the way to  the surface , and could you 
breathe? Well, there's no way. 

If you were here and you have a tube... 

here's the wa ter  level... 

and if this  is ten me ters, then the overpressure here between your  lungs and  the water is one

atmosphere , overpressure .


So here is one a tmosphere barome tric pressure .


Here is one atmosphere hydros ta tic pressure  plus the barome tric pressure, so here you have 
two atmospheres . 

So there is a huge force on your chest.


Inside your  lungs  is one a tmosphere , outside is two atmospheres and there is no way tha t you

could breathe .


If the area o f my chest is some 30 by 30 cen time ters--


which is a thousand square centime ters--


it would be like having a hundred-kilogram weight on my chest, and a lso on my back, of course,

because it's  in both direc tions--


it pushes  like this and it pushes like this and like this and like this.


So you're really being squeezed to dea th.


So wha t do you do when you go scuba d iving? You need pressured air with you in  the tank and

that you brea the , and so now , with the pressured air, you can obvious ly coun ter the hydros tatic

pressure from the wa ter .


Now suppose we go snorkeling.


That's different.


Then we do have a little tube in our mou th, and we snorkel.


How deep do you think we cou ld snorkel--

that our  lungs could easily accommoda te the hydros tatic pressure? Any  idea? Do you th ink we 
could snorkel maybe three me ters? Who th inks we could easily do three me ters? Okay, who 
thinks maybe on ly one me ter? Who th inks way  less than one meter?  Well, we know  it's no t way 
less, because snorke ls are this long , you know , so you know you can at leas t do 30 cen time ters, 
so it can' t be a ll tha t much less . 

Well, we can measure how deep we could snorkel and we can measure what the capacity ...


the capabilities o f our  lungs are in order to counter the hydrostatic pressure .


If I'm underwa ter , there is pressure on my ches t, and so to le t the a ir ou t is easy .


You jus t...


I'm squeezed in, righ t? Tha t goes out.


Bu t in order  to inhale , to suck in the air ...


[inha les]


I would have to push ou t my chest with a force tha t counters the force due  to the wa ter.


And so the ques tion is , what kind of pressure could I generate with my  lungs to overcome the

hydrostatic pressure? And we are going to measure that today with an instrumen t tha t we ca ll a 
manome ter. 

A manome ter  is a simple  tube--


it could be made o f anything , but a plas tic tube will do fine.


And we have liqu id in here.


It's open here and it's open here.


I pu t my mouth here, and I'm going to see how much overpressure I can produce in my  lungs by

pushing , by blow ing .


And so I'm go ing to blow in here and then this  level will go down and this  level will go up.


And th is he igh t d ifference--


let's ca ll tha t h--


and the density o f this fluid is rho.


We will use water for that, colored wa ter.


So the pressure here at y1 equals P1--


that's here--


and the pressure here a t y2 equals P2 .


And so P1 minus P2 equals rho times h .


I apply the law that we still have here--


P1 minus P2 , rho times h  times g .


I know  that  the P2 level is one a tmosphere , tha t's correct.


This  is one a tmosphere--


that's open to the world .


So P1 equals one atmosphere plus rho hg .


And so what my manome ter  indica tes  is how much pressure I can genera te over and above the

one a tmosphere , and we call tha t overpressure.


We o ften work with overpressure gauges.


When you go to the gas sta tion and you have your tire pressures measured--


the pressure in your tires--


there's a lso a gauge which measures the overpressure.


And so right there...


we have such a manome ter.


I'm going to blow  in here , and tha t's going to tell us  immediately how deep I can snorkel.


If I was able to make th is he igh t d ifference ten me ters, then I cou ld snorkel a t a depth o f ten

meters in the water , because it means tha t I could generate an overpressure o f one atmosphere.


If th is would only be five meters, then  I cou ld only snorkel down to five meters.


If th is is only a sad one me ter,  then I could really on ly comfortab ly brea the one me ter be low the

surface.


And that's wha t you see here and I wan t you to...


Already you know  it's no t go ing to be so fan tastically high.


Otherw ise, these hoses wou ld be longer .


This  is the level that we have now .


On this side is a tmospheric pressure,  that's open  there , and on th is side is also atmospheric

pressure, it's open .


That's why the leve ls are the same .


This mark  is 50 cen timeters above here and this  is 50 below.


So if  I can generate an overpressure in my  lungs o f one-ten th o f an atmosphere, then this one

would come up 50 centimeters and th is one would go down 50 cen timeters.


That's one meter o f wa ter .


One me ter of wa ter is equ ivalen t to a ten th of an a tmosphere, remember? Ten meters of wa ter  is

one a tmosphere hydrosta tic pressure.


So if  I can manage  that, then I can generate an overpressure in my  lungs o f a tenth o f an

atmosphere and I could snorkel, then, at a dep th of one me ter .


Let me  try it.


[inha ling deep ly]


[exhaling]


[inha ling ]


[exhaling noisily ]


A me ter  is impossible .


You can have it maybe for a few seconds , bu t not  for very long .


This  is very d isappointing.


So you cannot even snorkel at one me ter.


If someone else wan ts to try, I will cu t th is o ff, so it's very hygienic .


Maybe some o f you can do be tter.


You are the strong guy, remember?

Now, when you blow , don't make the liquid oscilla te , because then you can squir t it ou t.


You should rea lly try to take a deep brea th and then push as hard as you can.


STUDENT: Okay .


LEW IN : Go ahead .


Strong man ! You were about one meter and 20 cen timeters.


This  is grea t,  terrific.


[class applauds ]


How about sucking air? How much underpressure cou ld I generate in my lungs? Well, we can

measure it with th is instrumen t.


[inha les]


I can go like this and, o f course , the liquid will go the other way around .


Maybe I can do much be tter in  terms o f underpressure than in overpressure.


Let's try.


[class laughs]


Abou t the same, a lousy one meter .


When you're underwa ter, it's never a problem to le t air out, because due to the hydros tatic

pressure, there is a force on your chest.


So le tting the air ou t is easy.


The problem is to expand your  lungs again  to ra ise your chest.


That means the prob lem is that you can't...


[inha les deeply ]


suck in the air , and so it's really the second experimen t that  I d id tha t determines how deep you

can snorkel underwa ter , and we found  that it's about one meter .


So it's no t the blow ing out, bu t it is the ...


[inha les deeply ]


sucking in .


And so, this weekend--


and this  is a true s tory--


I said to myself, "Gee, suppose I see someone ...


"From the second  floor , " I look down on someone on the first floor "having a grea t glass o f juice or

wine or wha tever , beer...


and I would like to steal that by sucking it up with a straw."


[class laughs]


Could I do tha t? And the idea would then being ...


I would be s tand ing here .


The person being unaware o f th is glass down here with some grea t stu ff in it...


This would be my straw , and I would just suck  it up .


And I decided over the weekend that the s traw could not be much longer, then, than abou t tha t

one me ter tha t you jus t saw--


that's the underpressure .


In fact, when you go to supermarkets and you buy yourself this stu ff for kids, you know tha t this

can be done .


You can suck up at least...


this  is maybe 40 , 50 cen time ters.


That you should be ab le to do ;

otherwise they wouldn' t se ll them.


Bu t I d idn' t think that I could do much more  than a me ter.


And so I went  to the supermarket and  I bough t myself a hose and I bought the hose to be two

meters and  I s tood on the ...


in the k itchen , like th is.


And I had a glass there and I managed to do it.


And it surprised me.


So I wen t back to the super...


to the hardware store, go t myself a  three-meter hose ...  tube .


I knew  for sure that there was no way I was going  to do it, so I went to the second floor o f my

home--


I can look down on  the firs t floor ;

that's the way the house is built.


And I can' t be lieve it, I can' t be lieve it--


why I can suck so well.


It looks  like it's almos t a violation o f wha t I showed you, and so I need some he lp from someone.


And I'm going  to demonstra te how good I am in s tealing someone's drink.


Could you assis t me with tha t? Because you have  to hold my s traw  in tha t juice , you see ,

because I w ill go very high.


And so you ...


well, jus t s tand here , and I will  throw you the hose in a minu te .


Stand a little bit on the side , so  that  the class can see you.


I'll see you shor tly.


Hello .


[class laughs]


Okay, here's my s traw.


Can you pu t it in there? Now, as I'm going to  try to get this liquid up to me,  I want you to think

about why I can do tha t whereas there  I cou ld only do one meter.


There is some thing very special.


There's no way that in my lungs--


this  is five me ter almost--


there's no way that  I cou ld have half an a tmosphere underpressure in my lungs; that is not

possible.


So somehow I don' t do it with my  lungs, and maybe I won't even make it in the first place .


I can' t talk when  I do it.


I cannot talk.


There we go.


[class laughs]


LEW IN : Mmm.


Mmm.


[class laughs]


Okay, I drank cranberry ju ice, believe it or not.


Think abou t a ll th is and  try it a t home, it's fun .


Buy yourself a hose tha t is even longer .


Now wa tch it...


watch it, hold it.


If I take my finger o ff, wha t do you think will happen with the cranberry juice? It will run down,

there it goes .


Okay, thank you .


See you Wednesday.
