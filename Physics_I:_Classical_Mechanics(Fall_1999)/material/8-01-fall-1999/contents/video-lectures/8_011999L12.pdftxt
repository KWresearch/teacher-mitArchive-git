Transcript â€“ Lecture 12 

We're going to d iscuss today resistive forces and drag  forces. 

When you move an object through a medium, whether it's a gas or whether it's a 
liquid, it experiences a drag force. 

This drag force depends on the shape of the ob ject, the size of the object, the 
med ium through which you move it and the speed of the object.


The medium is immediately obvious.


If it's a ir and you move through a ir, you  feel the wind through your ha ir--


that's a drag force.


If you swim in water, you feel this drag force.


In oil, the drag  force would be even larger.


This drag force, this resistive force is very, very different from the friction that we

have discussed earlier when two surfaces move relative to each other.


There, the kinetic friction coefficient remains constant independent of the speed.


With the drag forces and the resistive forces, they are not at a ll independent of the

speed.


In very general terms, the resistive force can be written as k1 times the velocity plus

k2 times the velocity squared and always in the opposite d irection of the velocity

vector.


This v here is the speed, so a ll these signs--


k1, v and k2, and obviously v squared--


they all are positive values.


And the k values depend on the shape and the size of the object and on the kind of

med ium that I have.


Today I will restrict myself exclusively to spheres.


And when we dea l w ith spheres, we're going to get that the force, the magnitude of

the force--


so that's this part--


equa ls C1 times r times the speed plus C2 times r squared times v squared.


And aga in, it's a lways opposing the velocity vector.


C1 in our unit is kilograms per meters per second and C2 has the dimension of

density kilogram per cubic meters.


We ca ll this the viscous term, and we call this the pressure term.


The viscous term has to do w ith the stickiness of the medium.


If you take, for instance, liquids--


water and oil and tar--


there is a huge d ifference in stickiness.


Physicists also refer to that as viscosity.


If you have a high viscosity, it's very sticky, then this number, C1, will be very high.


So this we ca ll the viscous term, and this we call the pressure term.


The C1 is a strong function of temperature.


We all know that  if you take tar and you heat it that the viscosity goes down.


It is way more sticky when it is cold.


C2 is not very dependent on the temperature.


It's not so easy to see why this pressure term here has a v square.


Later in the course when we dea l with transfer of momentum, we will understand

why there is a v-square term there.


But the r square is very easy to see, because if you have a sphere and there is some

fluid--


gas or liquid--


streaming onto it, then this has a cross-sectiona l area which is proportiona l to r

squared, and so it's easy to see that the force that this object experiences--


we ca ll it the pressure term--


is proportiona l to r square, so that's easy to see.


Two liquids with the very same density would have...


they could have very d ifferent values for C1.


They could differ by ten... 

not ten, by four or five orders of magnitude. 

But if they have the same density, the liquids, then the C2 is very much the same. 

C2 is almost the density rho of the liquid--

not quite but almost--

but there is a very strong correlation between the C2 and the density. 

If I drop an object and I just let it go, I take an object and I let it fall--

we're only dealing w ith spheres today--

then what you w ill see, I have a mass m, and so there is a  force mg--

that is gravity. 

And as it p icks up speed, the resistive force will grow, and it w ill grow and it will 
grow, and there comes a time... 

because the speed increases, so the resistive force w ill grow, and there comes a time

that the two are equal.


And when the two are equal, then there is no longer acceleration, so the ob ject has a

constant speed, and we ca ll that the termina l velocity, and that will be the case when

mg equa ls C1 r v plus C2 r squared v squared.


And then we have here terminal velocity.


If you know what m is, the mass of an object, the radius, and you know the values

for C1 or C2 of that med ium in which you move  it, then you can calculate what the

termina l velocity is.


It is a quadratic equation, so you get two solutions of which one of them is

nonphysical, so you can reject that one.


Very often will we work in a doma in,  in a regime whereby this viscous term is

dominating.


I call that regime one, but it a lso happens--

and I w ill show you examp les today--

that we're working in a reg ime where really this force is dominating. 

I call that regime two. 

Where one and two are the same--

where the force due to the viscous force and the pressure force are the same--


we can make these terms the same, so you get C1 r v equa ls C2 r square v squared,

and that velocity we ca ll the critica l velocity, even though there is nothing critica l

about it.


It's not critical at all;  it's simply the speed at which the two terms are equa l.


That's all it means.


And that, of course, then equa ls C1 d ivided by C2 d ivided by r.


Now we're going to make a clear d istinction between the domains one and two, the

regimes one and two.


Regime one is when the speed is much, much less than the critical velocity.


So we then have that mg equa ls C1 r v termina l, and therefore the terminal velocity

equa ls mg divided by C1 r.


If you take objects of the same material--


that means they have the same density, the density of the ob jects that you drop in

the liquid or that you drop in the gas--


so that m equals 4/3 p i rho r cubed--


this is now the rho, the density of the object; it's not the density of the med ium--


then you can immediately see, since you get an r cubed here, that this is

proportional to the square of the rad ius if you drop objects in there w ith the same

density.


Regime two is the case when v  is much larger than v critical, so then mg equals C2 r

squared v squared if this  is the termina l velocity.


So the terminal velocity  is then the square root of mg divided by C2 r squared...


mg d ivided by C2 r squared.


And if you take objects with the same density and you compare their radii, m is

proportional to r cubed so this is now proportional to the square root of r.


So this separates these two regimes, and we will see examples of that that

sometimes you rea lly work exclusively in one and sometimes you work in the other.


I have for you a view graph that is on the Web so you do not have to copy it.


It summarizes what I have just told you.


It has a ll the key equations.


You see there on top the resistive force, the magnitude of the resistive force.


You see then the critica l velocity. 

There's nothing critica l about it; it's just the speed at which this term has  the same 
magnitude as this term. 

Then you see the cond ition here, which I call equation one for termina l speed, and 
then we have reg ime one, whereby the speed is way less than the critical speed and 
then you get the terminal velocity, as you see on the b lackboard, which then is 
proportional to r squared if you only look at ob jects which have a particular given 
density. 

And if the velocity, if the speed is way larger than the critical speed, you are  in 
regime two and then you have a dependence w ith the square root of r. 

I'm going to do a demonstration and some measurements w ith ball bearings, which 
have very precise radii--

very well known--

which I'm going to drop  into syrup. 

And we have chosen for that Karo light corn syrup. 

It may interest you that two tablespoons is 180 calories. 

I needed to know more for this demonstration and so I had to do my own homework

on it, but at least you see here what this Karo syrup can do  for you.


You see your 180 ca lories per two tablespoons...


or per tab lespoon.


It's very low fat, and the rest may interest you before you use it.


I had to know C1, which I ca lculated; I measured it.


In fact,  the kind of demonstration you and I w ill be doing today, you can derive it,

but it's very strongly temperature-dependent.


It could be d ifferent yesterday from today.


I measured C2 to a  reasonable accuracy.


Notice that the density of the syrup in terms of kilograms per cubic meter is very

close to C2--


I mentioned that earlier.


They're very close, not exactly but very close.


These steel ball bearings have a density of about 7,800 kilograms per cubic meter.


And I'm going to drop in that Karo syrup  four ba ll bearings, and they have diameters

of an eighth of an inch, 5/32, 3/16 and a quarter of an inch.


And what I calculated was the terminal velocity as a  function of radius of these ball

bearings.


All of this  is on the Web.


And so what you see here,  it is a  logarithmic plot--


this is a log scale and this is a log sca le.


Here you see the speed, and here you see the radius  in meters of the ball bearings.


And this is my solution to equation number one when I substitute various va lues of r

in there.


I get the terminal speed like this.


And this is the critical speed, which has a 1-over-r relationship.


If you look at this black dot here, then the terminal speed is ten times larger here

than the critical speed.


And so notice that when you are at speeds above that that you are exclusively in

domain two and your terminal speed is proportional to  the square root of the radius

of the ball bearings.


This black dot is a  factor of ten below the critica l speed, and so you see when you

are at lower speeds, when you work here, aga in, you see that you fa ll into...


exclusively in domain one, and you see that the termina l speed is proportional to r

square.


This slope here  is plus two in this d iagram and this slope here is p lus one-half.


Our ball bearings are all here, and so we are exclusively operating in regime one

where the viscous term dominates.


Now you could say, "Well, what is the meaning of this critical speed here if they

never reach that speed anyhow?" Well,  this critical speed for a small ba ll bearing

would be some hundred meters per second.


That's about 200 miles per hour.


There  is nothing wrong with injecting a ball bearing w ith 400 miles per hour into this

syrup, in which case, if you injected it w ith 400 miles per hour, you would be above 
the critical speed and so for a short while would the motion be controlled by the 
pressure term. 

But of course when gravity takes over, then you ultimately end up in regime one. 

So that's the meaning of the critical velocity. 

If you could g ive the ball bearing such a high speed, then the two terms are equal.


That's all it means.


Very well.


Now we are going to look at the various ball bearings, the various sizes, and I'll show

you how we do the experiment.


You will shortly see on the screen there seven marks which are one centimeter apart.


They are in the  liquid--


one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.


So here is the liquid, and the ba ll bearings are dropped from above.


When it reaches this line, I w ill start my timer.


And when it crosses one, two, three, four...


when it crosses this line, I will stop my timer.


And each mark is about one centimeter apart, so this is a journey of about four

centimeters.


And we w ill measure the time that it takes to go from here to here.


And the terminal velocity is given.


It's clearly regime one, so you see the termina l velocity right there.


Now, the time that it will take is of course this distance--


let me call it h--


that the ba ll bearings travel divided by the terminal velocity, and that is proportional,

since you're in reg ime one, by 1 over r squared.


And now I w ill give you the...


not the radii but I will give you the diameters of these ball bearings.


That's the way they come.


So we're going to get a list here of the diameters of the ba ll bearings, and the

diameters  is in inches.


My smallest one has a diameter of an eighth of an inch.


Then I have 5/32, I have 3/16--


all these things come in inches; that's one of those things--


and I have one-quarter- inch diameter.


If I plot here a plot, if I give you here the diameter in terms of 1/32s of an inch, then

this is four, five, six, and eight--


easy numbers.


Clearly if the time that it takes is proportional to 1 over r squared, it w ill a lso be

proportional to 1 over d squared--


of course, that's the same.


What I'm going to plot is not 1 over d squared, but to get some nice numbers I'm

going to plot for you 100 over d squared, whereby d is then in these units, 1/32 of

an inch, and that gives me some nice numbers.


Then I get a 6.25 here, I get a 4.00 here.


You can see 100 divided by 25 is exactly four.


I get 2.78 here, and my last number is 1.56.


And now I'm going to time it, and my timing uncertainty is of course dictated by my

reaction time.


That should be at least 0.1 seconds.


However, you will see when I reach the quarter- inch ball bearing that it goes so fast

that my error could well be 2/10 of a second.


It goes in a  flash.


So I would a llow here 2/10 of a second, and here I rea lly don't know--


maybe 1/10, maybe 2/10 of a second.


You may ask me, "Why didn't you give us the error in the d iameter?" which

ultimately, of course, translates into the error in the mass.


The reason  is that these are so precise the way you buy them that the uncertainty is

completely negligible compared to the timing error that I make, so I won't even take

that into account.


All right, so now we can start the demonstration, and I'll have to switch to this unit

here.


Here is this conta iner with the Karo syrup.


It is very sticky  indeed.


You see there are seven marks, and just for my own convenience, I have put there 
two b lack marks so that I can easily see the moment that I have to start my timer 
and the moment that I stop it. 

There are so many lines, I may get confused  if I don't do that. 

And we're going to time this together, and we'll see how these ob jects... 

how long  it takes for them to go through. 

I w ill start w ith my one-eighth-of-an-inch d iameter. 

I have one here--

tweezer. 

I release it at zero, three... 

oh, oh, you can't see that. 

You should see that: three, two, one, zero. 

Look how beautiful it's working it's way through! You see, it's build ing up. 

You see that nice air bubble at the top? It's going very slowly, but just wait when it

has broken through the surface.


There  it goes.


Now! One centimeter,  two centimeter, three centimeter.


Now! Okay, what is that?


[students respond ing]


LEWIN: Nothing.


What happened? STUDENT: 5.93.


LEWIN:  I d idn't see  it.


I want to do another one.


Did I... did I clean...


did I erase it?


[student answers]


LEWIN: How much was it? STUDENTS: 5.93.


LEWIN: 5.93.


Keep  that in mind.


It's nice to see whether they reproduce, actually.


Okay, there it goes.


Now! One centimeter,  two centimeter, three centimeter.


Now! 5.66--


that shows you the uncerta inty in my timing.


So we had a 5.93, and we have now a 5.66.


It's not so bad, 5.9, 5.7--


timing error a tenth of a second.


My timing error could be a little b it larger than a tenth of a second.


You don't have very much time.


So now we go to the 5/32.


Okay? 5/32.


It takes some time to break through the surface.


Isn't that funny? Because a thin  film has formed on the surface of the syrup due to

its exposure to air.


It's wonderful--


that lets us wait patiently.


But now it goes--


there it goes.


Now! One, two, three.


Now! 3.80.


Is that what you have?

It's going to be tougher and tougher for me.


3/16 of an inch.


It's actually a good thing that it stays for a while at the surface so that I can get

ready.


Really,  that really helps, doesn't it? If you do  this in water, it goes


[whoosh].


You don't even see it.


Come on... There we go.


Now!

Now! So you see, that's very hard for me, and so I could easily have a substantial 
error. 

2.69.


And now we have the quarter- inch, the real big one.


I have to do that again.


I don't trust this at all.


It went through the surface too fast.


[timer button clicking]


I... can't do it very accurately.


What was the first number, by the way?


[students respond]


LEWIN: One point...?


[student responds]


LEWIN: Six eight.


And this is 1.40.


1.68 and 1.40.


So you see I wasn't kidding when I said that my uncerta inty could easily be .2.


Now comes the acid test.


And the acid test is that  if I'm...


if the measurements were done correctly and if we rea lly work in that regime, then if

I p lot 100 divided by d squared versus t on linear paper, then it should be a straight

line.


All right.


Here I have a plot which I prepared, and  I'm going to put these numbers in there.


So first we're going to get six point... five point...


let's put in 5.8 seconds for the smallest ba ll bearing.


This is the sma llest one.


Don't be misled, because this is 100 divided by d squared, so this is the sma llest

one--


5.8.


So we are here on this line, and we are at 5.8--


somewhere here.


That's it.


Notice the point is lower than where I expected it, and the reason is the temperature

went up.


And if the temperature went up, then the viscosity goes down and they go faster.


But that's okay, that doesn't worry me.


The next one, 3.80.


Four, 3.80.


Ah! You see that? I predicted that--


straight line.


Isn't that a stra ight  line?


[students respond]


LEWIN:  It's not a straight line?


[students respond]


LEWIN: What's wrong?


Okay, we'll put in a third point.


2.69.


Two point...


This is 2.7--


2.69.


I can hardly put in the error of the timing, because it is not much  larger than the size 
of my dots. 

And now we have the  last one.


One point... let's take the average--


1.55.


1.55...


with an error of about 2/10 of a second, and this has an error of about 2/10 of a

second.


All right, there we go.


Now... is this a straight line or is it not? A gorgeous straight line.


And so you see you are really working here in the regime of 1 over...


in the reg ime where the terminal velocity is proportional to the radius squared.


Okay, we'll give you your lights back.


Now comes a question which  is relevant to this experiment, and that is, how long

does it take for the termina l speed to be reached? Well, the object has a certain 
mass, so there's a gravitational force on it, and the gravitational force equa ls mg. 

And then there is a resistive force, which in the case--

because we are operating in regime one exclusively--

that resistive force equa ls C1 r v in terms of magnitude, C1 r v, because we deal 
with regime one. 

And so  if I call this the increasing value of y, the second... Newton's Second Law 
would give me ma equals mg minus C1 r times v, and this equa ls m dv dt, so I have 
here a differentia l equation in v, and that can be solved. 

And you're going to solve it on your assignment number four. 

What you're going to see is that the speed as a function of time is going to build up 
to a maximum va lue... 

this is the... 

to a maximum va lue, which is the terminal velocity--

or you may want to ca ll it termina l speed--

and it's going to build up in some fashion and then it's going to asymptotica lly 
approach the termina l speed.


And this is what I'm asking you on your third...


on your fourth assignment, to calculate that.


If there were no drag force at a ll, I hope you realize that the velocity would increase

linearly, so you would get something like this.


So there's no drag.


So the behavior is extremely different due to the drag.


And I ca lculated a lready something that is part of your assignment--


how long does it take for the quarter- inch ball bearing...


how long does it take in time to reach a speed which is about 99% of the terminal

speed? And  I calculated that, and you will go through that ca lculation for yourself.


That  is only nine milliseconds.


In other words, once it has broken through the surface--


that takes a while because of the thin film--


then in nine milliseconds w ill I a lready be at 99% of the terminal speed, and so there

was no problem at a ll; when I wa ited for the ob ject to cross the first mark, it was

already clearly going at the termina l speed.


So that was fine.


Now I want to turn to a ir.


Air, of course, behaves in an extremely different way.


The princip le is the same, but the va lues for C1 and C2 are vastly different.


If we take air at one atmospheres, and we take it at room  temperature, then C1 is

about 3.1 times ten to the minus four in our units and C2 is about 0.85.


This is very close to  the density of air, which is about one kilogram per cubic meter,

which I told you earlier, C2 and rho are very strongly related.


And so the critical speed, which is C1 divided by C2 by r, is about 3.7 times ten to

the minus four divided by r meters per second.


And that is about 400 times lower than the critical speed in syrup, in the Karo syrup

for the same value of r.


So if I compare the quarter- inch ball bearing and I drop it in the Karo syrup, then the

termina l velocity in the Karo syrup is way below the critical velocity of the Karo

syrup.


The critical velocity of the Karo syrup would be 100 miles per hour for a quarter- inch 
ball bearing. 

So it's way below.


Here, in air, the critical velocity is something like 11 centimeters per second.


This is 11 centimeters in one second, and we know when you drop a one-quarter-

inch ball bearing in a ir that the speed is way larger, and therefore in the case of air, 
a quarter- inch ball bearing would have a speed way above the critical speed, and so 
you are now exclusively in regime two. 

That's the regime two.


Almost all spheres that you drop in air operate exclusively in regime two.


Whether it is a ra indrop or whether it is a baseball that you hit, or a golf ball, or even

a beach ba ll, or you throw a pebb le off a high build ing, or whether you jump out of 
an airp lane, with or w ithout a parachute, makes no difference, you're a lways 
dominated by the pressure term, by the v-square term, and you always are in a 
range whereby the termina l speed is proportional to the square root of the radius for 
a given density of the object. 

If you take a pebble with a radius of about one centimeter and you throw it off a 
high building, it will reach a speed which will not exceed 75 miles per hour because 
of the air drag. 

If you jump out of a plane and you have no parachute and I make the assumption 
that your mass is about 70 kilograms--

I want rough numbers--

if I can approximate you by a sphere w ith a radius of about 40 centimeters--

that's also an approximation, you're not really like a sphere, but I want to get some 
rough numbers--

then the termina l velocity is 150 miles per hour. 

So if you jump out of a plane and you have no parachute, you w ill not go much 
faster than 150 miles per hour. 

I just read an article yesterday about sky divers who jump out of p lanes, and they 
want to open the parachute at the very last possib le, and they reach terminal 
velocities of 120 miles per hour, which doesn't surprise me. 

It's very close to this rough number that I ca lculated.


Of course, then they open the parachute and then the a ir drag increases enormously

and then they slow down even further.


I told you a ra indrop... 

almost all raindrops operate in regime two when they fall. 

So the terminal velocity  is dictated by the v-square term. 

However, if you make the drops exceed ingly small, there comes a time that you

really enter reg ime one.


And on assignment number four I've asked you to ca lculate where that happens, and

I can't do it for water because the radius of that water drop w ill be so sma ll that it

would evaporate immed iately, so I chose oil for that.


So I'm asking you in assignment four, take an oil drop, make it sma ller and smaller

and sma ller and smaller, and there comes a time that you begin to enter reg ime one,

and I want you to calculate where that crossover is between these two doma ins.


I have here a ball--


you may call it a ba lloon, but I call it a ball because there's no helium  in it.


And this ball--


ooh!--


weighs approximately 34 grams.


So let me erase some here, because I want, yeah...


So we know the mass and we know the rad ius.


The mass  is about 34 grams and the radius is about 35 centimeters.


It's about 70 centimeters across.


I can calculate what the terminal velocity is--


a better name would be termina l speed.


I know I'm definitely going to be  in this regime, so I know the mass, I know C2, 
which in air is 0.85, I know the rad ius and I know g, and so I find that I find about 
1.8 meters per second.


So if I drop it from a height of three meters, which I'm going to do, then you would

think that the time that it takes to hit the floor would be about my three meters

divided by 1.8 meters per second, which is about 1.7 seconds.


That's not bad.


That's not a bad approximation.


However, it w ill, of course, take longer, and the reason why it will take longer is that

the terminal velocity, the termina l speed is not achieved instantaneously.


With the ba ll bearings, it was within nine milliseconds.


I can assure you that here it will take a lot longer.


Now, if you want to calculate the time that it takes to get close to terminal speed, 
that is not an easy task, because you are going  to end up w ith a nasty differential 
equation. 

You're going to get mg. 

You're going to get the acceleration which is the result of... 

Let's go with the equation we have. 

You see, we have ma equa ls mg and then we get minus the resistive force. 

And the resistive force has a term in v and has a term in v squared. 

You see, v and v squared, and so this cannot be solved analytica lly. 

But I've asked my graduate student Dave Pooley, who is one of your instructors, to

solve this for me numerica lly.


And I'm going to show you the results.


In fact, he prepared...


he has a nice view graph, and you can see the effect of time on the ball if you drop it

from three meters.


Here it is.


All the numbers are there.


This is on the Web, so don't copy anything.


You have the va lues for C1 and C2 are g iven at the top.


You may not be able to see them  from your seat, but they are there, and what you

see here is the height above the ground as a function of time--


this is one second,  this is 1Î©  seconds; this is the three-meter mark.


If there were no a ir drag--


remember we dropped an apple early on  from three meters--


it will hit the floor at about 780 milliseconds.


However, with the air drag,  it will be about one second later, more like 1.8 seconds.


So the 1.7 wasn't bad, as you see, but if you  look here at how the speed builds up as

a function of time, you see it takes about three-, four-tenths of a second to build up

to that terminal speed, which is the 1.8 meters per second that you have there. 

And need less to say, of course, that the acceleration due to gravity does not rema in 
constant but goes down very quickly, and when the acceleration reaches, approaches 

zero, then you have terminal speed, and  then there is no  longer any change in the

velocity.


So let's try this.


We'll give more light.


And we're going to throw this object, and I don't think you're going to get 1.8

seconds.


You may get something that is larger than 1.8 seconds, and the reasons are the

follow ing.


Number one, this  is not a perfect sphere, and only for spheres do  these calculations

hold--


that's number one.


Number two, this thing is very springy, so the moment that I  let it go, it probab ly

goes in some kind of oscillation.


That doesn't help either.


That w ill probab ly also slow  it down, because what causes, of course, this slowdown

in regime two is rea lly turbulence.


Turbulence is extremely hard to understand and pred ict.


And so a lmost anything I do, I will only add turbulence, and therefore I pred ict that

the time that it will take from three meters will be probab ly  larger than 1.8 seconds, 
but it will be substantially larger than the 780 milliseconds, which is what you would 
have seen if you drop an app le. 

So let's see how close we are.


So, turn on this timer.


Make sure I zero it--


I d id.


And...


It's not so easy to release it, by the way, and start the timer at the same moment.


And it's not even so easy for me to see when it hits the ground, so there's a huge

uncerta inty in this experiment.


Okay.


Three, two, one, zero.


What do we see?


Did I see something? 2.0--


that's not bad.


See? The prediction was 1.8; you get 2.0.


That's not bad, so  this takes the a ir drag into account, and it is not even an

approximation.


It uses the entire term linear in v as well as in v square.


But it's a lmost exclusively dominated by the v-square term.


I a lso asked Dave to show me what happens when I throw a pebble off the Emp ire

State Building.


And the pebb le that we chose had a  radius of one centimeter--


it's the kind of pebble that all of us could  find--


I know roughly the density of pebb les, and when we throw it off the Empire State

Building, we reach a termina l speed of about 75 miles per hour.


Without the a ir drag, we would have reached 225 miles per hour.


So I want to show you that, too.


So now you see this Emp ire State Build ing, which has a height of 475 meters, so

that's where you start, at t0; this is one second,

five seconds... ten seconds, five seconds, 15 seconds, and  if there had been no air

drag, it would hit the ground a little less than ten seconds, but now  it will hit the

ground more like 16, 17 seconds. 

And you see that the terminal speed builds up in about five, six seconds. 

It's very close to the final va lue, and if there had been no air drag, then the speed at

which it would hit the ground would, of course, grow linearly, and when it hits the

ground, it would be somewhere here, which is 225 miles per hour.


So you see that it's even a pebb le you wouldn't expect to be...


to have a very large effect on air drag,  it is huge, provided that you throw it from a

high building.


Now, you may remember that we dropped an apple from three meters and that we

calculated the gravitational acceleration given the time that it takes to fall.


That was one of your...


one of the things you did in your assignment.


We had 781 milliseconds, I think.


And out of that you can calculate g, right? Because you know that three meters is 
one-half g  t squared, so I g ive you the three, w ith an uncertainty, I give you the 
time--

781 milliseconds with an uncertainty of two milliseconds, which we allowed.


Out pops g.


So I asked Dave, "What is the effect of air drag on this apple? Was it a  responsib le

thing for us to ignore that?" The apple has a mass of 134 grams.


It's easy to weigh, of course.


So this was our apple during our first lecture--


m is 134 grams.


It's almost a sphere, really--


not quite but almost a sphere--


and the radius  is about three centimeters.


And that leads to a termina l velocity which you can ca lculate if you want to using the

v-square term, but I was not interested  in that.


I wanted to know how many milliseconds is the touchdown delayed because of the

air drag.


And Dave made the calculations, and he found that that is two milliseconds from

three meters.


From 1Î©  meters  it's almost nothing, and the reason why it's a lmost nothing  from 1Î©

meters--


you see, when you throw an apple in a ir, it's rea lly in reg ime two, so you're rea lly

dominated by the speed squared, and the first 1Î©  meters it doesn't get at very high

speed yet.


The speed grows linearly, and so it is the last portion where you really get hit by the

air drag, by the v-square term.


Two milliseconds from three meters, so if h is three meters, there is a two-

millisecond...


let's call it delay.


So we were on the hairy edge of being lucky and unlucky.


If you rea lly want to recalculate the gravitationa l acceleration using our data, you

should  rea lly subtract the two milliseconds from  the time.


On the other hand, since we a llowed a two- millisecond uncertainty, we really

weren't too far off.


Now comes my last part, and that is, how does air drag influence trajectories? And

that is also part of your assignment, but I'm going to help you a  little bit w ith that.


In your assignment number four, I'm asking you to eva luate quantitatively the 
motion of an object in liquid, but I give that object an initial speed in the x direction, 
and then there's the liquid below. 

Then gravity is there, and there is that initial speed. 

If there were no drag, then this, of course, would be a parabola, and the horizontal

velocity would always be the same.


There would never be any change.


But that's not the case now.


Because of the resistive forces, because of the drag by the liquid, the object is going

to get a velocity in this direction, so there's going to be a component of the resistive

force opposing it.


It has a speed in this direction, so there's a lso going to be a component of the

resistive force in this d irection.


And that w ill decrease the speed--


this component in the x direction.


And so you can already see that the curve that you're going to see is a very different

one.


It's going to look something like this.


And then ultimately, there is nothing left of this component, and ultimately, when

you go vertically down, you have the termina l speed that you can find from dropping

an ob ject just into the liquid vertica lly.


So that's something you're going to dea l w ith in your assignment number four, and

this is exclusively done in regime one, because we have an ob ject w ith liquid, and

with liquid, you a lmost a lways work w ith regime one.


Suppose I take a tennis ba ll and I throw up a tennis ball in 26.100.


There  is air drag on that tennis ball.


In the absence of any a ir drag, I would get a nice parabola which w ill be comp letely

symmetric.


I throw it up w ith a certain initia l speed, v--


call it v0, I don't care--


and the horizontal component would never change.


This would be v0x; it would always be the same.


But now w ith a ir drag, you're going to see that there's going to be a force, an a ir

drag force in the y d irection.


If the ob ject goes up in this direction, then there will be a resistive force component

in the y direction, and since it has a speed in this d irection, there w ill a lso be a

resistive force in the x d irection, so this speed is going to be eaten up  in the same

way that this component was going to be eaten up.


This component is going to suffer.


It will not stay constant throughout, and as a  result of that, you're going to get a

trajectory that looks more like this.


It's asymmetric.


Clearly you don't reach the highest point that you would have reached w ithout a ir

drag, for the reason that this resistive force in the y d irection will not allow it to go 
as high--

that's obvious.


You don't go as far as you would w ithout a ir drag, for obvious reasons that this

resistive force is going to kill this speed, but you also will get asymmetry in the

curvature, and I want you to see that.


I call this point O, this point P, and let's ca ll this point S.


So what I w ill do is I w ill throw up a tennis ball and then I will throw up a Styrofoam

ball, and the Styrofoam ball has very closely the same rad ius as the tennis ball.


That means the resistive force is the same on both, because the resistive force is

only d ictated by r squared and by v--


r squared v squared, remember? However, this has a way larger mass than this one,

and even though the resistive forces will be closely the same if I throw them up with

the same initial speed, it has a way larger effect on a smaller mass than on a larger

mass.


F = ma, right? So on a very large mass, the resistive force will have a much lower

effect than on the sma ller mass, even though the resistive forces are about the

same.


So, try to see


that the tennis ball is very close to an ideal parabola.


You will not even see any effect of asymmetry.


It will not be the case for the Styrofoam, though.


So, look at the tennis ball first.


I should  really do it here.


Did it look more or less symmetric? Okay, now I'll try this one.


Did it look asymmetric? Could you see it? Are you just saying yes, or you really saw

it? Let me do it once more; I can throw it back.


So now it should curve like this and then sort of come down like that.


You ready?


You see the asymmetry? Okay, now comes my last question.


I'm going to ask you the follow ing, and there's a unique answer to that.


I want you to think about it and  I want you to be ab le to give an answer with total,

100% confidence.


When this ob ject goes from O to P,  that takes a certain amount of time.


When it goes from P to S, back to the ground, that takes also a certa in amount of

time.


Is this time the same as this time? Or is this time longer than this time, or is this

time shorter? Think about it.


See you Friday.
