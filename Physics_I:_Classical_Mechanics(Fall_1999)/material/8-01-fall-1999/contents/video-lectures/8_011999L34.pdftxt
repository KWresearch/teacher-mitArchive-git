8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 34 

All physics of the 19th cen tury and ear lier  is called classical physics. 

Examples are Newtonian mechanics, wh ich we dea lt with this whole term, and elec tricity and 
magne tism, which you will encounter the next term. 

In the early part o f this cen tury, when we learned about the composition o f a toms, it became clear 
that classical physics did no t work on the very small scale o f the a toms.


The size o f an a tom is on ly ten to  the minus ten meters .


If you take 250 million of them and you line them up,  that's on ly one inch.


In 1911 , the English physicis t Ru ther ford demonstra ted tha t almost all the mass o f an a tom is

concentra ted in an extreme small vo lume a t the cen ter of the a tom.


We call tha t the nucleus , it's positively charged .


And there are electrons which are nega tively charged , which are in orbits around the nuc leus,

and the typica l d istances from the nucleus to the e lectrons is abou t 100,000 times  larger than the

size of  the nucleus  itse lf.


As early as 1920 , Rutherford named the proton , and Chadwick d iscovered the neu tron in 1932 ,

for wh ich he received the Nobe l Prize .


Now, let us  imagine tha t this  lecture hall is an a tom.


And the size o f an a tom is de fined by the orb its , the ou ter orbits o f the elec trons.


If I scale it properly, now , in this ratio 100,000 to 1 , then the size of  the nucleus would be even 
smaller than a gra in of sand . 

And it just so happens tha t yesterday I wen t to Plum Island, I walked  for three hours on the beach 
and I ended up with some sand in my pockets . 

And so I will donate to you one pro ton ; make sure you hold onto it... 

Ooh, this  is two protons , tha t's too generous. 

So keep it there--

this  is one pro ton . 

And there would be an electron, then, anywhere there , near the walls , going around like mad in 
orbit and that would then be a hydrogen a tom. 

Just think abou t what an a tom is . 

An atom is all vacuum.


You and I are all vacuum.


You th ink o f yourself as being some thing , but we are nothing.


You can ask yourself the ques tion , If you are all vacuum, why  is it, then , tha t I can move my hand

not through the o ther hand , like a ghost can walk through a wall? Tha t's no t so easy to answer ,

and in fact, you cannot answer  it with classical physics and I w ill no t re turn to that  today.


Bu t you are all vacuum.


According to Maxwell's equations, Maxwell's  law o f e lectricity and magne tism, an elec tron,

because o f the a ttrac tive force of  the proton, would spiral in to the pro ton in a minu te fraction of a

second, and so a toms cou ld not exis t.


Now, we know tha t's no t true .


We know that a toms do exis t.


And so tha t crea ted a problem for physics and it was the Danish physicis t N iels Bohr who in 1913

postula ted that elec trons move around the nucleus in well-defined orbits which are d istinc tly 
separated from each other, and that  the sp iraling-in of the electrons  in to the nucleus does no t 
occur, for the reason that an elec tron cannot exis t in be tween these a llowed orb its . 

It can jump from one orbit  to another, bu t it canno t ex ist in between . 

Now, Bohr's sugges tion was earth-shaking , because it would also imply tha t a plane t tha t goes

around the sun canno t orb it the sun jus t at any distance.


You couldn' t move it just a trifle in or a trifle far ther out.


It would a lso require discrete orbits.


It would a lso mean  that if you had a  tennis ball and you would bounce the tennis ball up and

down, that the tenn is ba ll could no t reach jus t any leve l above the ground , but it would only be

discrete levels , and tha t is very much against our  intuition.


We'd like to th ink tha t when you bounce a tenn is ba ll, that it can reach any level tha t you want to.


You give it just a little bit more energy and it will go a little higher.


That, according to quantum mechanics, wou ld not be possible.


Now, all th is seems ra ther bizarre , as it goes agains t our daily experiences, but be fore we dismiss

the idea o f quantization--


see, the quan tiza tion comes  in when you talk abou t discrete orb its--


you have to realize tha t the differences in the allowed heights of  the tennis ball and the

differences between the allowed orbits o f the plane ts around the sun would be so infinitesimally

small that we may never be able to measure it.


In o ther words , quantum mechanics really plays no role in our macroscopic world .


Now, atoms are very , very sma ll compared to tennis ba lls, and the quantization e ffects are much

larger in the sub-microscopic wor ld o f elec trons and a toms than in our familiar world of baseballs,

pots and pans, and planets .


So before we con tinue, I wou ld like to repea t to you one of  the cornerstones o f quan tum

mechanics .


And it says tha t the electrons  in atoms can only ex ist at well-defined energy  levels--


think of them as being orb its--


around the nucleus, and they canno t exist in be tween .


Now, when I hea t a subs tance , the elec trons  in the a toms can jump from inner orbits to allowed

outer orbits, and when they do so , they can leave a hole, an opening, an empty space in the inner

orbits.


Bu t later on , they can fall back to  fill  that opening .


They can occupy tha t place aga in.


And when I keep hea ting this substance , there is some kind o f a musical chair game going on .


The electrons will go to ou ter orb its , they may spend there some time and then they may fall to

lower orb its , to inner orbits.


You see here a vase , a very precious vase , and when I pick up this vase, I have to do work .


I bring it further away from the cen ter of the Ear th.


Now, is tha t energy lost? No .


I cou ld drop the vase, and it would pick up kinetic energy.


I will get  tha t energy back .


Gravita tional potential energy will be converted to kine tic energy.


It will crash to pieces, and it will genera te some hea t.


In fact, the break ing itse lf of  this vase wou ld take some energy.


In a similar way , the energy that you put in to elec trons when you bring them to ou ter orb its  is

retrieved when the electrons fall back.


So there is a parallel--


dropping th is vase and ge tting your work back tha t I put in .


It wouldn't be a nice th ing to do to  this 500-year-old vase, but as far as I'm concerned, perfectly

reasonable to do it w ith Ohanian, so we can le t tha t go, and the energy will come ou t in the  form

of heat and also in  the form of, perhaps, some noise .


When electrons fall from an ou ter orb it back to an inner orbit, it's no t k inetic energy tha t is

released, bu t it comes ou t often in the form o f ligh t, e lectromagnetic rad iation.


Light has energy .


Eins tein formu lated tha t a light photon , the energy o f a light pho ton , is h times the frequency, and

h is Planck's constant--


named a fter Max Planck--


and h is abou t 6 .6 times 10 to the minus 34 joule-seconds.


Now we've also seen in 8.01 tha t lambda , the wavelength of light, equals the speed o f ligh t

divided by the frequency.


And so if I eliminate the frequency, I also can write tha t the energy of a ligh t pho ton equals hc

divided by lambda.


And so you see , the more energy there is available , the sma ller the waveleng th.


And the less energy there is available , the longer the waveleng th.


And so if the jump  from an ou ter orbit  to an inner orbit is very high , then the wavelength will be

shorter than when  the jump is relative ly small.


I can make you some kind of an energy diagram o f these jumps.


And these are energy leve ls, so energy goes in this direction , but if you wan t to , you can  think of

these as the position of how  far the elec trons are away from the nucleus , if you like tha t, if it helps 
you, so this w ill be the e lectron  that will be the closest  to the nucleus. 

So these wou ld be allowed energy levels, allowed orbits.


And if this elec tron had jumped all the way here , then it could fa ll back a t a later moment in  time

and the energy could be so much that you couldn' t even see the light.


It could be ultraviolet, and this  jump may still be ultravio let, bu t now th is jump , which is a little less 
energy, tha t may be in the blue part o f our spec trum. 

So we may see this as blue light.


And th is one, which is a little less than this , this energy may genera te,  this  jump may genera te

green ligh t.


And the jump  from here  to here, which is even less, may genera te red ligh t.


And a jump from here to here, wh ich is even less, may again be invisible, so this may be in frared .


And so as the electrons fall from ou ter orb its to inner orbits, you expec t very discrete energ ies to

come out, very discre te waveleng ths, and these wavelengths tha t you would see correspond,

then , to these allowed transitions between these energy levels .


So if we could look a t tha t ligh t and sor t it ou t by color , we wou ld, in a way, see these energy

levels.


Now, you have in your  little envelope a piece o f plastic, which we ca ll a grating, and  the grating 
has the ability to decompose the ligh t in colors, which we call a spectrum, and we're go ing to 
shortly use  tha t gra ting  to look at light from helium and light from neon . 

Bu t be fore we do tha t, I'd like to hand ou t--


as a souvenir to a few people , randomly picked--


something that they can also use .


It's not as good as your gra ting , though , bu t it's also nice.


You will see a more spec tacular result, bu t not as clean .


It's not as clean .


All righ t, one for you, one for you , one for you and one for you.


And you want one--


I can tell that--


and you wan t one .


And here , for you, for you .


Oh, no , this side hasn't had any thing.


I've go t to walk all the way over now .


So th is is really for children's parties , which I'm handing out.


Oh, George Costa , you wan t one , o f course.


Professor Cos ta wants one--


I cou ldn't bypass him.


And you want one, okay, and you wan t one.


So , by all means , use your grating , bu t then, a t the very end , you can always use these little

spectacles, which don't work nearly as well, bu t, uh ... th is kind of  thing .


I'm going to light here th is bu lb, this  ligh t, which has helium in it, and wha t you're go ing to see with

your grating , if you hold your grating properly--


you may have  to ro ta te it 90 degrees ; you w ill see how that works when you try it--


you're going to see very , very sharp, narrow  lines a t var ious colors .


I want you to realize tha t the reason why you see very sharp, narrow  lines  is only because my

light source are very sharp , narrow  line.


If you use it on some thing tha t is no t a very sharp, narrow line, then you're not going to see

through that gra ting very sharp , narrow  lines .


So don' t con fuse the lines tha t are on the grating with the line source that  I have here .


Now, when you look through your gra ting very shor tly, you will see , on both sides, the wonderfu l

lines.


It's a mirror  image , and we will discuss it in a little bit more de tail, but be fore you look through 
your grating , I first wan t you to simply  look a t it withou t the gra ting , because then it is even more 
spectacular when you use the gra ting . 

Because you have no clue, when you don' t use the grating, wha t kind o f colors are h idden there. 

And the colors that you are going  to see are these electron levels . 

So I am go ing to make it dark. 

And I will turn th is on . 

And th is one, I be lieve , is helium. 

I have a gra ting here . 

So we have to rota te it so that you see ver tical lines on either side . 

You may have  to ro ta te it 90 degrees , no more . 

And if you look closely--

for instance , look on the righ t side of the ligh t--

you'll see a dis tinct blue line , a  few blue lines, green , very nice br igh t yellow one , and you see

red.


And if you go further to the righ t, you see a repeat.


It's a little fain ter, bu t you see a repea t o f that.


That's no t importan t r igh t now; I jus t want you to see that this  light, which you have no idea tha t it

comes out in very d iscrete wavelengths , very discrete  frequencies, and  they correspond to these

jumps from allowed energy  levels to o ther allowed energy levels , but there is no thing in between.


And when you look on the le ft side, you'll see a mirror  image o f what you see on the righ t side.


Now, neon ... excuse me , he lium has only two elec trons .


I'm now going to pu t in the neon bulb and tha t makes  it richer, for reasons tha t neon has ten

electrons , so you have many more orbits, so many more ways tha t the elec trons can p lay musical

chair.


A lot o f lines  in the red--


I'm no t b locking you , I hope--


a lo t o f lines  in the red, and some beau tiful lines  in the yellow.


I see some in the green , I don' t see much in the blue...


a little bit in  the blue .


Bu t the key thing is , I want you to see that these lines are discrete . 

It is not jus t any wave leng th tha t can be generated; it's only the allowed orbits , the musical game 
when the elec trons  jump from one orb it to another , and tha t gives you this unique discrete 
spectrum. 

Now, these light spec tra were known long before Bohr came with h is daring ideas , bu t before 
quantum mechanics,  these lines were a great mystery, but they no longer are .


I suggest you use this grating and use it when you are outside a t n igh t; look at some stree tlights ,

particular ly sodium lamps and mercury lamps .


And , o f course, the neon lamps are qu ite spec tacular , but keep in mind, you will no t see very nice

straigh t lines unless your ligh t source itself is a very nice straight, narrow  ligh t source.


Now, quan tum mechan ics took a big leap in the  '20s , and it would be impossible  for me in the

available amoun t of time to do justice to all the bas ic concepts.


However, I will d iscuss some consequences tha t are ra ther nonin tuitive .


Prior to quantum mechanics, there was a long-stand ing battle be tween physic ists whether ligh t

consists o f partic les or whe ther they are waves.


Newton believed strong ly tha t they're particles, and the Dutchman Huygens believed tha t they

were waves .


And it seemed like , in 1801 , tha t a conclusive experiment was done by Young , which

demons trated unambiguously tha t ligh t was waves ; Huygens was r ight.


Bu t as time wen t on, discomfort was growing , as there were also experimen ts tha t showed rather

conclusively tha t ligh t rea lly was par ticles .


And it was one o f the grea t vic tories of quantum mechanics that it showed tha t ligh t is bo th .


At  times it behaves  like waves and at other times, it behaves like par ticles ; it all depends on how

you do your experiment.


In 1923 , Louis de Broglie made the daring suggestion that a particle can behave like a wave , and

he specified , he was very specific , tha t the wave leng th--


which nowadays  is called de Brog lie wavelength--


is h, Max Planck's constant, divided by the momen tum of tha t partic le and the momentum is the

mass o f the par ticle times the ve locity, as we have seen in 8.01.


If the momen tum is higher, then the waveleng th is shor ter.


A baseball will have a very high momentum, with a ridiculously  low...


short wave leng th .


Now, one of the s tartling consequences is that pro tons and e lectrons , which everyone of that time

considered partic les, can then also be considered as being waves.


And in 1926 , the Austr ian physicist Schrodinger drove the na il in the coffin with his famous 
equation--

Schrodinger's equation, it's called now--

which is the ground pillar o f quan tum mechan ics and it unifies the wave and the par ticle character

of ma tter.


Returning to my baseba ll,  take a mass o f the baseball of, say, half a kilogram and give it a speed

of 100 miles per hour.


Calcula te the wavelength tha t you wou ld find, according to quantum mechanics .


That waveleng th is so absurdly sma ll, it is 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the rad ius o f an

electron , so it is comple tely meaningless.


So quan tum mechan ics plays no role in our macroscop ic world o f po ts and pans and baseballs.


Bu t now take an electron.


You take  the mass of  the electron, 10 to  the minus 30 k ilograms.


And you give the electron a speed of, say , 1,000 me ters per second.


Now you ge t a waveleng th which is comparab le to the waveleng th of visible light, red ligh t.


And now  it's something that becomes very meaningfu l, something that can be measured.


Now, you may argue , "Gee, wha t difference does it make? "Who cares whether something is a

wave or whether some thing is a particle?" Well, it makes a huge difference , because waves have 
crests and they have valleys, and so if you take two sources of waves, either wa ter waves--

two sources, tapping up and down on the wa ter--

or you can take two sound sources,  then there are certain locations on the surface o f the water 
where the crest of one wave arrives a t the same time as the valley o f the o ther, and so they 
cancel each o ther out. 

There is no thing, there is no motion of  the water .


We call tha t destructive inter ference .


Of course, there are o ther places where there is constructive interference , where they suppor t

each o ther.


Now, if par ticles can do tha t, too...


That is very hard to imagine--


how can one par ticle with another particle inter fere and vanish , tha t the two par ticles no longer

exist? So if, indeed , particles are waves, you should be able to demonstra te tha t by having the

inter ference pattern o f two particles, like  the water waves, and make--


at cer tain loca tions in space--


those particles d isappear , which turn ou t to be possible .


Bu t tha t's a very nonin tuitive idea .


So we think o f it too classica lly when we say , "Well, two particles cannot disappear." But in 
quantum mechanics, you can th ink in waves  if you wan t to, and then you have no problems w ith 
the interference pa ttern and the des tructive in ter ference at cer tain loca tions . 

Now, there are o ther remarkab le consequences of quantum mechan ics in classical mechanics .


If you and I are clever enough , you think that we should be able to de termine  the position of an

object to any accuracy tha t we requ ire, and a t the same time de termine also its momen tum a t any

accuracy tha t we require.


It's  just a matter o f how clever we are .


Simultaneously, the object is righ t there and that is  its mass and tha t is its speed.


However, the German physicis t Heisenberg rea lized in 1927 tha t a consequence of quan tum

mechanics  is tha t this  is not possib le.


Strange as it may sound to you , Heisenberg s tated tha t the position and the momentum o f an

object canno t be measured very accurately a t the same time .


And I will read to you Heisenberg's uncer tain ty principle , the way we know  it.


It says, "The very concep t of exact position o f an objec t "and its exact momentum, together , have

no meaning in nature ." It's a profound nonclassica l idea , and it is hard for any one o f us--


you and me included--


to comprehend .


Bu t it is consis ten t w ith all experiments that we can do to da te.


I want to repeat it, because it's go ing to be important o f what fo llows.


"The very concept o f exac t position of an object "and its exact momentum, toge ther , have no

meaning in nature." Wha t does it mean? Firs t, le t me w rite down Heisenberg's uncer tain ty

principle .


Delta p , wh ich is the uncerta inty  in the momen tum, multiplied by de lta x, which is an uncertain ty in

the position of  that par ticle , is larger or approx ima tely equal to Planck's cons tan t d ivided by two

pi--


for wh ich, in physics, we call that "h-bar"--


and h-bar  is approxima tely 10 to the minus 34 jou le-seconds.


You see, h is 6.6 times 10  to the minus 34.


If you divide  that by two pi, you get abou t 10 to the minus 34.


What does th is mean , now? Wha t it means tha t if  the position is known to an accuracy delta x--


we'll g ive you some examples--


that  the momentum is ill- determined, is no t determined , to the amoun t delta p, larger or equal

than h-bar divided by delta x.


That's wha t it means.


And I'll g ive you an example wh ich I've chosen from a book of George Gamow .


Gamow wro te a book wh ich he called  Mr. Tompk ins in Wonderland. It's abou t dreams .


Mr. Tompkins wan ts to unders tand the quantum world , and there is a pro fessor--


you will see a pic ture o f the pro fessor--


who takes h im, in his dreams , along the var ious remarkable nonin tuitive effec ts o f quan tum

mechanics .


And in one o f these dreams, the pro fessor suggests that we make h-bar one .


And the pro fessor takes a triangle in the pool tab le and he pu ts  the triangle over one billiard ball,

so the billiard ba ll is cons trained in its position and tha t delta x  is roughly...


say, 30 cen timeters, 0.3 meters.


That means tha t the momen tum is no t determined, no t determined  to an approximate value o f

one d ivided by 0 .3 , is about 3 kilogram-meters per second.


Now, if we give the b illiard ball a mass of one kilogram, then delta p is m delta v, and so if m is

one kilogram, then the speed o f tha t b illiard ball is unde termined , accord ing to Heisenberg's

uncertain ty principle, by a t leas t approximate ly three meters per second .


Three me ters per second--


that means seven miles per hour, and so tha t b illiard ball w ill go around like crazy in tha t triang le,

and tha t's exac tly what happens in the dream.


And I will show you here a picture from tha t book.


Mr. Tompkins is always  in pajamas , just to remind you that it is a dream.


And need less to say , the pro fessor is a very old man and has a very nice beard ; it adds to  the

prestige .


And I will read you  from this book.


I will read you a very short paragraph  tha t deals w ith  this.


"So the pro fessor says, "'Look , here , I'm going  to put definite limits "'on the position of this ball by

putting it ins ide a wooden triangle .'" "As soon as the ball was placed in the enclosure , "of the

whole inside o f the triangle "became filled up with g litter ing o f ivory.


"'You see,' said the pro fessor, "'I de fined the position o f the ba ll "' to the ex ten t o f the dimensions

of the tr iangle .


"'This results  in cons iderable uncer tain ty  in the velocity "'and the ball is moving rapidly  inside  the

boundary.


"'Can't you stop it?' asked Mr . Tompkins .


"'No, it is physically  impossible .


"'Anybody  in an enclosed space possesses a certain motion . 

"'We physicis ts call it zero po int motion , "'such as, for example , the motion of electrons  in any 
atom.'" So here you see quan tum mechan ics a t work when h-bar  is one . 

This  is a very nonclassical idea , because you and I would think--

and we've always dea lt with tha t in 8.01--

that you can take an object and place it a t location "a," and we say at time  t zero it is a t "a" and it 
has no speed and we know the mass, so we know bo th the momen tum and the position to an 
infin ite accuracy. 

Bu t according to quan tum mechanics, that's not possib le.


So le t's now re turn to the rea l wor ld, where h-bar  is not one, bu t where h-bar is 10 to the minus

34, and le t's now pu t a b illiard ba ll inside  this triangle .


Now, delta x  is the same, bu t since h-bar is 10 to  the minus 34 , delta p is , of course, 10 to the 34

times smaller, and so the velocity is 10 to the 34 times  smaller .


This unde terminedness ...


degree to which the velocity  is now unde termined , is so ridiculously small--


it is 3 times 10 to the minus 34 me ters per second--


that if you a llowed tha t ba ll to move w ith  tha t speed, in 100 b illion years , it would move only 1/100

of a diameter of an electron , so it's mean ingless again.


And so again , you see that quantum mechanics plays no role in our daily macroscopic world of

baseballs and basketballs and billiards and po ts and pans.


And therefore , it is comple tely okay for us to say , "I have a billiard ball which is at po int 'a ,' and its

mass is one kilogram and it has no speed." Tha t is complete ly kosher , complete ly accep table ,

and quantum mechanics has no problems with that.


Let's now turn to an a tom.


Take a hydrogen a tom.


The diameter o f a hydrogen atom is abou t 10  to the minus 10 meters .


So the electron is confined to a delta x o f abou t 10  to the minus 10 me ters.


That means the momen tum o f tha t electron becomes undetermined--


according to Heisenberg's uncer tain ty pr inciple--


to abou t 10  to the minus 34 , div ided by 10 to the minus 10, is abou t 10 to the minus 24 kilogram-

meters per second .


What is the mass o f an electron? Tha t's about 10 to  the minus 30 kilograms.


So th is, delta p, is also m delta v.


So it means tha t delta v--


that means the velocity of  the elec tron--


is unde termined , according to He isenberg's princip le, by an amount which is at least 10 to the

minus 24 , wh ich is this delta p div ided by the mass o f the electron , which is 10  to the minus 30.


And that is abou t 10 to the six me ters per second--


that is one- third of a percen t o f the speed o f ligh t.


So the electron is moving only because of the fact  that it is con fined .


That's wha t quan tum mechanics  is all abou t.


The electron's motion is d icta ted exclusively by quan tum mechanics.


I'm going to show you an experiment in which  I want to convey to you how nonintu itive

Heisenberg's uncerta inty principle is.


I have here a laser beam, and this  laser beam is going to be a imed through a narrow slit--


I'll make a drawing, I' ll turn this  ligh t o ff--


and tha t slit, wh ich is a vertica l slit, can be made narrow and can be made w ider.


Here is th is light beam and here is this opening , this slit.


It's only going  to be con fined in this direc tion , not in this direction .


And so the light will come ou t here, and then, on a screen, which is going to be  that screen , a t

large d istance capital L , we're go ing to see that light spot, due  to the light beam going through  the 
slit and th is separa tion, capital L. 

I s tart off with the slit a ll the way open and so you're going to see  this  ligh t spot like this.


And then I'm going to make the slit narrower and narrower, and as I'm going to cut in to the light

beam, what you're going to see is exac tly what you expect.


You expect  tha t this  ligh t disappears, and when I cut in  further, you see exac tly what you expect,

that  this  ligh t disappears.


And so the light spo t there on tha t screen w ill become narrower and narrower and narrower.


Bu t then there comes a poin t tha t Heisenberg says, "Uh-uh, carefu l now, because your delta x ,

your knowledge, "the accuracy  in th is direc tion where  the light goes through "is now so high  tha t

now I'm going to in troduce "an uncerta inty  in the momentum o f tha t ligh t.


"The momen tum o f tha t ligh t is now no longer determined to infinite accuracy ." And wha t tha t

means , if you s tart  fooling around with the momentum of tha t ligh t in the x d irection, it no longer

goes through straight bu t it goes o ff at an ang le, and  I will make you a more quantita tive

calculation for that.


So le t's look a t this slit from above.


Here's the slit, and the slit has an opening , delta x .


And th is de lta x we're going to make sma ller and smaller, and let us s tart with a delta x o f about

1/10 of a millime ter , wh ich is 10 to the minus 4 me ters.


I have ligh t, I know the wave leng th of the ligh t, and  I know that lambda equals h d ivided by p,

according to De Brog lie .


I know  the wavelength , I know h, and so I can calcu late the momen tum o f tha t ligh t.


I have done tha t,  take my word for  it.


It is abou t 10 to the minus 27 kilogram-meters per second.


That's the momen tum o f the individua l ligh t photons.


Think of them as particles, which you can do, according to de Broglie.


So now I have a delta p , the degree to which the momentum is undetermined, according  to

Heisenberg , is going to be 10 to the minus 34 divided by delta x--


which is 10 to  the minus 4 , so tha t is 10 to  the minus 30, very sma ll.


Bu t the momentum itse lf is 10 to the minus 27 , so it's only one par t in a  thousand .


So wha t will happen? If  the ligh t comes through here ...


And I now make a classical argument.


I say , "This is the momen tum of the ligh t as  it comes s traight in ." When it has to be squeezed

through this narrow opening , Heisenberg's uncer tain ty principle demands that it is going to be 
undetermined,  the momen tum in this direc tion by rough ly 10 to the minus 30 , or more . 

Remember , it is a lways larger or equal.


In o ther words , if I in troduce , for  instance, in th is d irection or  in th is direc tion , delta p, then I would

expect tha t some o f tha t ligh t goes o ff in  this direction.


It is this change in momen tum, th is undeterminedness  in momentum, tha t makes  it go o ff a t an

angle , on ly in the x direc tion .


If I have the slit like this, don' t expect this to happen in this direc tion , because the uncer tain ty  in

the y direc tion , tha t's not the problem.


Delta y  is no t very sma ll, it's delta x that is very sma ll, so it's this direction tha t's going to give you

trouble .


It's only  in th is direc tion  that you know precisely where that ligh t goes through.


This d irection is no t the issue .


So th is ang le the ta can now be ca lcula ted very rough ly.


Theta is obviously de lta p divided by p , so theta is very roughly 10 to the minus 3 radians , wh ich

is a fifteenth o f a degree , and if you have a t a distance L--


if this dis tance here is L--


if you have here a screen,  then the spo t on this screen...


if I call that x a t location L,  then x a t location L is obviously the ta times L .


And if the ta is 10 to the minus 3--


and let's assume this  is about 10 meters away from us, so L is abou t 10 me ters--


then you get 10 to the minus 2 me ters.


That is one centimeter .


One cen time ter  in this direc tion and one cen timeter in that direction--


two centime ters.


Bu t when I make the slit wid th 10 times sma ller , if I make the slit wid th only 1/100 of a millime ter,

then th is becomes 10 centimeters , because now I know delta x 10 times be tter, and so delta p is

10 times more uncertain .


So now I expect  to see here a t least a smear o f 20 cen time ters and a t leas t a smear o f 20

centimeters there.


So the absurd ity  is tha t a teeny-weeny little ligh t source which in the beginn ing you w ill see as a

very small spo t...


When I make  this s lit narrower and narrower , indeed, you will see tha t you will lose photons, and

you will see  this getting narrower and narrower, and then all o f a sudden, it begins to spread ou t,

and it begins to spread ou t, and by the time I'm c lose to a ten th of a millime ter,  the ligh t spot will

be yay big .


Very nonin tuitive .


You make the slit smaller, and the photons spread ou t.


And I wan t to show tha t to you now .


I have to make it very dark.


And I need my flash ligh t, turn on the laser beam.


There you see it.


The slit is now all the way open.


Yeah , it's all the way open, and  I'm going to close the slit now slowly.


And if you look closely , you will see tha t the ...


Let me also ge t my red laser, then I can poin t some thing ou t.


You will see that  the ligh t will ge t squeezed in the hor izontal direc tion.


You can see a lready at the left side, has a very sharp vertical cut-o ff, and the right side also . 

It's getting narrower, it's ge tting narrower.


Getting narrower , but I'm nowhere nearly a tenth o f a millimeter ye t.


It's getting clearly narrower.


You see, it's getting narrower , it's getting narrower.


If I look here ...


oh, I'm not yet a t the tenth o f a millimeter , but  I'm ge tting there.


I'm going slowly, squeez ing it.


I'm squeezing those pho tons .


Those photons now are  forced to go through an extremely narrow open ing and Heisenberg is

very shortly going to jump in and says , "You are going  to pay a pr ice for tha t.


"You know too well where those pho tons are in the x d irection .


"The price you pay--


"that na ture will now make the momentum undetermined in the x direc tion ." And you begin  to...


you see it now .


You really beg in to see tha t the cen ter portion is widening.


Even pho tons appear .


Here, you see some dark lines, which  I will not  further d iscuss today , but no tice that the ligh t is

spreading .


Of course, when I squeeze this slit, when I make it narrower, it's obvious that I lose light, because

the ligh t tha t hits the s ide of the slit is not going through , so the ligh t intensity will go down.


That's  jus t inevitable .


I used  fewer pho tons.


Bu t look a t this .


There are photons here , there are pho tons there.


It's at leas t 10 cen time ters, this portion.


From here to here is at least one foot.


I squeeze more--


this  is more than half a meter now .


I squeeze more--


this  is about one meter already.


I squeeze even more .


I close  the s lit now , and I will open it slowly .


I'm opening it very slowly, and a t the moment  that it opens...


Look a t this ! You see th is?  You see this wonder ful streak? It looks more like a comet.


From here to here is at least a me ter.


That's that cen ter por tion o f the light.


It has spread out, s ince the poor  light was forced to go  through this very narrow opening.


Now I'm open ing it more and more.


I'm opening it more , and now, o f course , the reverse is happening.


Extremely non intuitive.


Now, not on ly have you seen quan tum mechanics a t work, in  terms o f e lectrons  jumping between

orbits, bu t you now have a lso seen one o ther very in teresting consequence o f quan tum

mechanics , which is He isenberg's uncerta inty principle .


Now, the spread ing of this  ligh t can very easily be explained withou t He isenberg's uncerta inty

principle .


In fact, it was known , even in the previous century, to a high degree o f accuracy, why this

happens, and the dark lines were very accurate ly exp la ined.


All I wan ted  to show is that the spreading o f the ligh t is entirely consis tent with Heisenberg's

uncertain ty principle, and it better be, because it would not be possible , it would be inconceivable

that you could do any experimen t tha t would violate Heisenberg's uncer tain ty pr inciple .


And if this  ligh t tha t you would see on the screen there , if  that light spo t would ge t narrower and 
narrower and narrower and narrower all the time, as we would  think classically , tha t would have 
been a vio lation of Heisenberg's uncertainty princip le, and that is no t possible . 

Now, there is no way  in advance to predic t which photons end up where . 

All you can do w ith quantum mechanics  is to do the experiment with lots of photons and  then you 
will get a certa in d istribution and the dis tribu tion will be exactly as you saw there . 

Quantum mechanics can never predict, on an individua l pho ton , where it will end up. 

We saw that brigh t spot in the center . 

So if you did this experiment with one pho ton per day--

one photon per day going through  this slit--

and you had a pho tograph ic p late  there , and you wou ld keep it there for months , and you would 
develop it, you would see the same pattern that you see there. 

This photon arrives today.


Here arrives one tomorrow .


Here arrives one the day a fter tomorrow .


Here one  the day a fter tha t, the day a fter that, the day after  that, the day a fter that, the day after

that, the day a fter that, and slowly are you beginning to see tha t pattern that you saw.


So don' t think that this inter ference pa ttern  tha t you saw is the result o f two pho tons going

through the slit simultaneously--


not at all.


You can do it with one pho ton at a time and you would see exactly the same  thing .


Now, this  idea--


that you canno t in advance predic t what a particular photon will do--


is a very nonclassic  idea, and it rubs us all the wrong way because our c lassical way o f thinking

is--


and you are no different from my own feeling in  this respect--


that if you do an exper iment a hundred  times in a con trolled way, you should ge t a hundred times

exactly the same resu lt.


Not so , says quan tum mechanics.


All that quantum mechanics w ill tell you is wha t the probability  is that something will happen .


No guarantees , but it is very good in predic ting probab ilities .


Now, Einste in had great prob lems with this  idea o f not knowing precisely what wou ld happen , and

he had endless d iscussions with Bohr and others  in which he tried to convince them that because

you couldn't predic t what happened , tha t some thing had to be wrong with quan tum mechanics,

and Eins tein's famous words were, "God does no t throw dice ." This was the way, was his way o f

saying, "It is ridicu lous tha t the ou tcome o f a well-con trolled experimen t is uncer tain ." Now,

almos t n ine decades have gone by s ince the beg inning of quantum mechanics, and we now know

that God--

if there is one--

does throw dice. 

However, God is bound  to the rules of quantum mechanics and canno t v iola te Heisenberg's

uncertain ty principle.


The ligh t could not go stra igh t through withou t spreading when I made the slit as narrow as I did.


So quan tum mechan ics is a bizarre world tha t we rare ly experience in our daily  lives , because we

are used to baske tballs, baseba lls, tennis balls .


Bu t ye t it is the way the world ticks, and atoms and molecules can only exist because o f quan tum

mechanics .


That means you and I can only ex ist because of quantum mechanics. 

I hope tha t this will g ive you some thing to think abou t, but I warn you in advance, because if you 
start th inking abou t th is, it will give you headaches and  it w ill give you sleepless nights . 

And it has given me countless sleepless n igh ts in  the past, and even today, when  I think abou t 
the consequences--


the bizarre consequences of quantum mechanics--


I s till canno t comprehend it, I still canno t d igest it and I still have headaches and sleepless nigh ts.


Bu t it may be necessary to go through these sleep less nights  if you wan t to even tually evolve as

an independent thinking scien tist, and I hope tha t someday all o f you will.


Thank you.
