8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 26 

When we take a spring, something that we are so  familiar with now, and  the spr ing has leng th l in

a relaxed state , spr ing constan t k, I can extend the spring with some  force tha t I apply .


The spring,  then , w ill coun ter it with the spring force and it will be in equilibrium there .


I call this the zero position , and le t's call  this now delta l instead of x, which we have done be fore .


If I double the  force, delta l will double .


Hooke's Law says tha t the force is  linear with delta l; in other words, delta l is proportional with F.


Nothing new, as  long as Hooke's Law ho lds.


If I make the spring twice as long, I wou ld get double the extension , because when I have two

springs in series , each one, under the influence of  this force, w ill ge t longer by this amount.


Since I have two springs in series , I will ge t twice de lta l.


So delta l is also propor tional to the leng th of my spring .


If I take two springs parallel, one like so and one like so , relaxed leng th l, bo th the same spr ing

constant k, and if now I apply a force on it, then each one o f these spring forces is only half this

one.


Toge ther they coun ter this force .


In o ther words , the extension delta l tha t I obtain from this external force is now only half as much

as it wou ld be w ith one spring, and if I had three springs paralle l, all identical, I would only ge t

one-third o f the extension for a given force.


In o ther words , de lta l is also inversely propor tiona l to the number o f springs that  I have,

assuming that  they are identical springs.


Now I'm going to use a rod or wire which has cross-sectiona l area A and leng th l, and I'm go ing to

apply a  force here.


As a result of that force it w ill ge t longer by a certain amoun t delta l, exactly like  the spring .


And clearly , when I make  this force stronger, delta l w ill increase , and as  long as Hooke's Law

holds tha t the spring force provided by the rod balances this ou t--


provided tha t the spring  force is  linearly proportional with delta l--


I have again that delta l w ill be propor tiona l w ith  the force.


Double the force, I ge t twice de lta l.


If I pu t two o f these rods toge ther--


so I doub le the length o f the rod--


then clearly I will get tw ice delta l, because each rod w ill experience the force , each rod w ill ge t

longer by de lta l, and so  two rods will get longer by two delta l.


So again , delta l is proportional with l.


Suppose , now , I have two of  these rods nex t to each other--


notice the paralle l with the two parallel springs here--


and I apply a force F.


Then the spring  force on each one o f them--


if I call that the spring force--


will only have to be half to coun ter this force .


So they bo th have a cross-sectional area A, and so now with double  the cross-sectional area , I

get only half o f delta l.


And so now we have a situation tha t if  I made a rod whereby this was 2A, jus t one rod, which is

comple tely equ ivalen t to th is situa tion , I'm on ly ge tting half delta l for a given force .


And so now we have  tha t de lta l is proportiona l...


inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area o f the rod.


So now we can make up the ba lance, and we can say, "Aha! De lta l is proportional  to the force,

proportional to l, "and inversely proportional to the area , the cross-sectional area ." So F divided

by A is then proportional to delta l over  l, and  tha t proportiona lity constant we give a name, and

that is capital Y, and that is ca lled Young's modulus . 

So th is is Young's modulus. 

F over A, which has the dimension of pressure--

force per un it area--

is wha t we call s tress. 

And delta l over l, which is d imensionless, we call tha t s train . 

If we compare two rods w ith different values o f Young's modulus , then the one with the sma ller

value o f Y for the same stress will g ive you a larger stra in.


In o ther words , it's easier to make it longer .


If Young's modulus  is very high , then the rod is ex tremely stiff.


Then it is very difficult to make  the rod longer .


I have here  for you some numbers wh ich, o f course , are on the Web so you don' t have to copy

them.


And you have Young's modu lus there for various metals, and  I a lso have it down there for nylon ,

and today we will work w ith  tha t qu ite ex tensively .


We cou ld first do a simple example just  to get a feeling  for what is at stake here .


I can take a rod with a rad ius r , wh ich is 0 .5 centime ters.


That wou ld give me a cross-sectional area o f e igh t times ten to the minus five square meters .


So , yay th ick, the rod .


I make it very simp le--


I make the length one me ter, and  I hang on the rod , a t the bo ttom, a mass M, wh ich, le t's say , is

500 kilograms.


Do I wan t 500 kilograms? Yes, I wan t 500 kilograms.


In o ther words , the force which I pu ll on the rod is abou t 5 ,000 new tons .


So I can now ask myself how much longer  is this rod going to be? So we're go ing to have that

delta l is going to be F d ivided by A times  l divided by Young's modu lus.


And we do know what F is , we know wha t l is and we know wha t A is .


So in our case , this number  is 6.3 times ten to the seventh for the numbers that we have .


And so now we can look a t s teel as an examp le.


So we take stee l.


Y is 20  times ten to the ten th new tons per square me ter.


And we substitu te tha t in here, and we  find that we get an ex tension delta l which , I believe , is

only a third of a millime ter--


indeed , 0 .3 millime ters.


Think abou t this : s teel rod , a cen timeter thick, and it has a length o f one meter , and I hang 500

kilograms on it and it only ge ts longer by three-tenths o f a millimeter .


You couldn' t even see tha t.


However, if you go and make the rod, wh ich would be really a rope ...


If you make it out o f nylon, which has a Young's modulus...


Oh, well, it's 55 times  lower.


I don't have to use that number .


It's abou t 55 times  lower , so the de lta l will then be 55 times  larger.


And so, ins tead o f a third of a millime ter, I will get some thing like 17 millimeters .


And that you can see with your naked eye.


I take a rope yay th ick o f nylon.


I hang 500 k ilograms on it and I will see it gets  longer by 1.7 cen timeters.


You can see tha t right in front o f your eyes.


If I star t adding more weight on these bars , then very in teresting things are going to happen as

we will d iscuss today.


One thing wh ich is obvious tha t w ill ultimately happen if you keep loading down, keep add ing 
mass, it will break. 

And the breaking poin t is g iven there in the third column, and we call tha t the ultima te tensile 
strength.


So when F over A--


when this value--


becomes too large, that's wha t it comes down to , then it will simply break.


If we take the case  that we have here , the steel rod, for which F over A is 6.3 times ten to the

seventh--


because l is one , remember--


then you can look there under steel tha t it wou ldn't break.


We would be very safe , because it wouldn' t break un til F over A becomes five times ten to  the

eighth.


So we're a factor o f ten away from tha t--


there's no problem.


Even nylon would be very sa fe , because tha t wouldn' t break un til the s tress is three times ten to

the eigh th .


However, if we chose aluminum, if we made the bar ou t o f aluminum, then you're very close to

this number 6 .3 times ten to the seven th .


And so if you add a little bit more mass than 500 kilograms, your aluminum bar would break .


So you see , the properties o f these meta ls are very, very differen t indeed.


Now, before it breaks, we reach a situa tion that  the s tra in is no longer proportional to the s tress.


In o ther words , we abandon Hooke's Law, as I will show you also today with a demonstra tion .


The ma teria l begins to de form.


It begins to flow , in a way.


And even when you take the weigh ts o ff, it will no longer have its original leng th .


It will no t return  to the orig inal length bu t it will be much longer.


And I will try to ske tch you here what a curve o f s tress versus strain typ ically  looks  like.


So here I'm going to p lot delta l over  l, and here F over A.


So th is is the stress and this  is the s train .


In the beg inning, you will see a portion tha t is linear.


That's Hooke's Law .


And then, when you keep add ing force--


which we will do by gravity, we will jus t hang weigh ts on it--


then it starts to bend over , up to a poin t here wh ich we call the elas tic limit.


And even though th is por tion is no longer  linear--


so even though Hooke's Law no longer holds--


still, if you take the weigh t o ff the wire , o ff the rod, it w ill still come back to zero.


Once you are past  this poin t, that is no longer the case .


You will now see also that a sma ll increase of stress will give a huge stra in, so the rope will...  the

rod will get very long all of a sudden with a little bit of extra stress .


And if now you were to  take the weight o ff the rod , it would not come back to zero bu t it would 
come back somewhere  to here so it's permanently de formed . 

And in genera l the rod gets ho t, and  the work that you have done goes into hea t and goes  into 
the deforma tion o f the rod .


And so it goes  like th is and then it goes like this and here it breaks .


At  this va lue for F over A, which is tha t third column there, it will break .


I'd like to discuss w ith you th is horizonta l portion.


With a little b it o f luck we may ac tually be able to see that w ith my demonstra tion , but it's hard to

get exactly a t tha t po int.


If th is par t of the curve is horizon tal, it means tha t w ithout any increase o f F over A,  the wire will

continue to get longer and longer , and we call tha t plastic flow.


So th is who le portion here is plastic flow.


It almost becomes  like a liqu id.


And then right here  there is some thing very s trange tha t is happening .


Then when it breaks , the stress here is ac tually lower than there , and this  is some thing I can 
never show you in class, but  I can expla in to you why that happens. 

When you are pas t this poin t here , the rod begins to pinch, and you get th is.


It's unpredic table where it will p inch, bu t somewhere it will s tart  to pinch so tha t the area here is A

prime whereas the cross-sectional area here is A.


And so F d ivided by A prime will be larger than F divided by A.


If you could do th is experiment in a controlled fash ion--


and there are mach ines designed  to do tha t--


then you could actually  lower F over A so tha t the stress actua lly goes down but that F over A

prime would s till go up , and there fore delta l will increase.


And there are machines who are specially designed to  test these me tals , and what they do is they

go up in very small steps o f F--


and so they trace this whole curve--


but by the time that  they get in to the plastic flow area, they... before they  increase the  force, they

decrease it first.


And if de lta l ge ts larger when they decrease it, they continue to decrease it, and so  that's the

way that they can map out also  this portion.


Bu t we will not be able to do tha t.


There are me tals which are extremely brittle , and even  though  the curve wou ld look very similar--


it has a ll these charac teristics--


this poin t, then , would lie all  the way here.


So th is who le curve , then , is squeezed in to very sma ll parame ter space o f the stra in.


And so I want you to see most of  this, a t least some of this, and we do tha t w ith a demons tration

which we have there, and  I w ill make a drawing o f the basic idea .


We have a copper wire--


you will get the d imension from me very shortly--


and we a ttach  to the copper wire a rod, a solid rod .


And at  the end of the so lid rod is a mirror.


This  is a mirror.


And we're going  to hang weigh ts on here.


Bu t this mirror  is on a little pla tform and can pivo t at th is poin t but canno t lower  itself.


The pla tform is fixed .


For those of you who are very close , this  is where tha t platform is .


That is a fixed platform.


And so the mirror can only tilt bu t canno t go down.


And so now I will show you what happens when th is wire ge ts longer.


So here is the wire , and this  is where the ...


This  is this  line here .


Bu t now the wire has become longer.


So the wire is now  longer by an amoun t de lta l.


So th is is now the po int where  this bar, this rod is attached.


And so the mirror will now be like th is.


We have  tilted the mirror.


And we have tilted  the mirror over an angle de lta theta , and th is length is  l.


And we're going  to load it down w ith a mass M, which we're going to increase .


And then we have a laser beam which we sh ine on to the mirror.


The laser beam comes  in like so .


And th is is the norma l to the mirror, so this ang le here is delta the ta .


The laser beam bounces o ff and re turns... like so , and this ang le, o f course , is a lso de lta  theta.


That's the property of a mirror.


And th is beam...


This  is the laser beam here  tha t we shine into the mirror.


Here's the laser, it goes in to the mirror, and the spot  there o f tha t re turn is a ll the way there on the

wall.


So we are go ing to show you where th is spo t is on the wall, and  the wall is very far away .


It's a d istance capital L from the wire.


And you'll see very shor tly why we do it tha t way .


Let me  first give you the dimensions o f th is ins trument.


L is 36 cen time ters.


It is copper.


This bar, which has  leng th d, is 7Î© centime ters.


The distance to the wall is about 16 meters .


The radius of the w ire...


or actually,  the diame ter o f the wire , of the copper w ire is 20 /1,000 of an inch .


I g ive it in terms o f the d iameter because that's the way tha t the manu fac turer g ives it to us.


And that translates in to a cross-sectional area o f tha t w ire o f 2 .0 times ten to the minus seven

meters squared .


All righ t, no tice that delta theta , that angle...


the angle here , delta the ta , is delta l divided by d .


So delta the ta equa ls de lta l divided by d .


The ligh t tha t re turns hits the wall there at a distance l, so y a t the wall, or I can call it delta y--


that is at  the wall, I call that displacement there delta y--


divided by l will be two delta theta .


This  is a sma ll-ang le approximation ; it's a very good approxima tion , and theta is  in radians .


It is two delta theta , because you see here  tha t the change is over an angle two delta.


And so delta y equa ls 2L delta theta ...


2L de lta theta  times delta l divided by d .


And look wha t we have done now: We have conver t something that is  immeasurable , delta l--


which is frac tion o f millimeters--


we have convert  that  to some thing on  the wall that we can measure, because this ratio, 2L over

d, in our case , for the dimens ions tha t I have chosen, is abou t 425; it's  like

a magnifica tion factor .


So if we see a d isplacemen t o f that laser beam on the wall of 40 centime ters, wh ich is easy to

see, it means tha t the wire go t longer by only one millimeter.


So 40 centime ters there transla tes to one millime ter there, and if we would see that laser beam

go up four me ters, it would mean tha t the wire wou ld only have become one centimeter  longer.


So it is a wonder ful way to magnify the effect and  to measure it.


So I will now make an attempt  to load down the copper wire.


Oh, we can ac tually leave this here , so you can see tha t curve .


So we s tart here with ...

we load up with half k ilograms.


We will write down, then, how much tha t laser spot goes up on the wall.


And then, in be tween increas ing the weight, increasing  the force we will  take the masses o ff to

see whe ther they return...


whether the leng th of the rod re turns to the orig inal length.


And you will see after a while that you ge t permanent deformation,  then it no longer comes back

to its original leng th .


In o ther words the laser spo t w ill no t re turn to zero on the wall but it will stay higher.


So Ron , if you are  there ...


Oh, boy, you're hid ing behind...


Um, maybe we want  to move the view graph out o f the way so tha t s tuden ts can a lso see .


So , here is that copper wire which will be hard to see for some o f you--


it's only 20/1 ,000 o f an inch thick--


and here is that mirror wh ich can pivo t and can tilt.


And Ron is going to put weights on here, and  then we will take the we igh ts o ff in be tween and we

will try to construc t a curve of the s tress versus s train , except tha t it is practical  for me to pu t here

just the mass--


how many k ilograms we have on  there--


because we know wha t A is, so we can calcu late F over A.


That's no t so impor tant now .


And here I simply have delta y .


Bu t keep in mind that de lta y  is always 425  times larger than delta l.


So we're going to p lot it, and we're going to see whether we can come up w ith a curve tha t is

somewha t s imilar to that one .


So , Ron, if you pu t on the first half kilogram...


The mirror always star ts to oscilla te a little bit and so we have to be a little patient, and in the

beginning, you may be bored because--


tja !-- we're going through tha t linear part o f the curve.


So it goes up very slow ly, very gradually .


We have  five centime ters for the  first half k ilogram.


Could you remove the half kilogram? It returns prac tically to zero .


Maybe it's a little h igher , but that's not very significan t.


Could you make it one kilogram? Ah , ah, it's clearly h igher.


Ja, ja ... oh, it's about nine cen time ters, nine, ten, so you see it's  in the linear part--


nine to ten cen time ters.


Can you remove the half kilogram, Ron? The one kilogram,  there was one kilogram on it.


We have  to just wait, le t it damp ou t a little .


It's oscilla ting .


It's possible  that you already beg in to see a small de formation which may be one or 1Î©

centimeters.


I pu t a question mark there--


it's possible .


Can you pu t 1Î© kilograms on? Yeah , I th ink it is...


You can almost remove the ques tion mark.


So now we are a t 1Î©.


So if it is str ictly  linear, you would expec t some thing like 15 .


Yeah , tha t's what it is, 15, so it's still doing qu ite well.


Can you take them o ff? One and a half.


Ah , bu t you see it no longer wan ts to return to its original length.


It's clearly  longer now .


Permanen t deforma tion has already occurred , and so we're now someth ing like six cen time ters.


Can you make it two kilograms? Two kilograms.


If it's linear, you would expec t near 20.


It's still amazingly  linear .


It's as close as I can see it to 20 , but all  these readings are no more accura te than half a

centimeter or so.


So can you remove the  two k ilograms? Oh , boy, look at tha t--


there's clear deforma tion now .


It no longer re turns to zero, and it is...


Oh, it's comfor tably ten centime ters  long now .


So can you make it 2Î©? You're now slowly approach ing the part that I hope you are going to see, 
and tha t is that it is go ing to take o ff like a rocket, tha t with a little bit of ex tra we igh t, it will star t to 
move substan tia lly. 

We haven't reached that point yet, but we are close to it.


We're now 26--


25, 26...

it s till looks qu ite linear.


Can you take it off, Ron? Actually , there's no need to  take it o ff anymore because it's clear that 
we... 

that we have permanen t de forma tion, and there's no sense in fo llow ing tha t, so why don't you 
make it three kilograms? So wha t was it? Wha t did I say it was? Wha t was the number I said? 20 
what? 25 or so? So we have three now? Boy,  this w ire is hang ing in there , I must te ll you. 

32, yeah.


Can you make it four? Watch very close ly now on  the wall, because  the drama is about to start

now.


What did  I say , 30 ...?  I said 32 .


Four.


Ooh, still moving , s till moving .


52... settles at 53 .


Now, don' t look a t the board--


now, look at this spo t now .


Can you add ... remember the number, righ t? 53 .


Can you add one kilogram now? And look a t tha t.


It became almost tw ice as  long and it is s till moving .


Still going... still going.


I hope it will se ttle.


I'm going to write down my 53.


Five kilograms.


We're a t five , r ight? 97--


now pu t on six .


97--


remind me, 97 .


Now, watch this poin t.


Yay! Now you're clearly  in that plas tic flow por tion .


By adding one kilogram, look where that poin t is--


it's s till moving .


What was five? 97? So we're now at six kilograms.


Oh, actually , tha t is still easy for me to es timate.


I would say it's about double the leng th o f tha t stick tha t we have on the wall, and the s tick is two

meters long.


Is it moving? Tha t's s till moving a little b it.


It's a little more than four me ters.


Close enough , four meters , just for the idea .


Four me ters, so tha t's 400.


Pu t on seven .


It will go  through  the ce iling now.


So we'll lose it.


Bu t what I wan t to do now , I want  to get to  the breaking poin t.


We can no longer measure the d isplacemen t, bu t we're very close to  the breaking po int now .


So we're going to load it up to the poin t tha t it will break , and tha t a llows us to measure the

ultima te tensile s treng th .


We're a t seven now--


can you put eight on? Oh, we're running ou t of...


[chuckles]


Oh, God ! You cou ld just see it sag when  the eigh t was put on.


Did you actually  look at  the wire? Okay, so at eight kilograms, it breaks.


Okay, let's pu t these numbers  in here.


So , we have 1Î© ...


or half a kilogram, we have five cen timeters.


Let me do this  in co lor.


So tha t gives me a poin t here .


And then at one , we have about ten.


And at 1Î© , we have about 15 .


And at  two, we have abou t 20.


And at 2Î© , we have 25.


Oh, I was a little bit too high here, perhaps.


I want to go a little bit more care fully because this  is really terrific da ta .


So th is was at...


And then we have...

at 2Î©, we have 25.


Amazing how well...

how linear tha t is! And then a t three , we have 32.


Ah ! It looks  like it's beg inning to bend over.


At  four, we have 53 , no question.


Oh, yeah .


And then at five, we have 97.


Here is five--


97, tha t's here.


And then our last poin t tha t was...


Oh, we even have a 400 here.


Ooh, that's grea t.


Here is 400 .


And wha t do we have  there? A six .


One, two, three,  four, five, six.


That's our  last po int.


And then we don't have the res t.


Bu t look how wonderfu l this  is, isn' t it? Isn' t tha t a great curve? Very linear  in the beg inning.


Then it starts to bend over , over .


And you draw tha t line anywhere you wan t to ...


and then it breaks.


And so we can now actually make an a ttemp t to calculate Young's modulus from the da ta.


Of course, you'll have to select a portion where you think tha t the da ta are reasonably  linear.


So Young's modulus  itse lf...

equals F divided by A.


Here you have here the equation.


Young's modulus equals F d ivided by A times l divided by delta l.


We know wha t A is , we know wha t l is .


It's still on the blackboard  there .


And so now  it's a ma tter o f where do we  think tha t Hooke's Law s till ho lds? I th ink this whole

portion wou ld be fine , so we could take this point as we ll as th is po int, because anywhere on this

straigh t line , you will get the same value  for Young's modulus.


So I will use two kilograms and 20 cen time ters--


I will use this poin t.


So F equals 200 new tons , and then we have delta y equals 20 cen timeters.


And so tha t means de lta l equa ls 20 divided by 425 cen timeters .


So th is is F divided by A, l, and then we have here delta y times 425.


And le t's see wha t tha t is.


So F is 200--


that's righ t.


No, no, F is 20--


ooh, ooh , ooh, ooh , ooh .


I'm glad tha t we caught that simultaneous ly.


So F is 20--


20 new tons , tha t's right.


The area is two times ten  to the minus seven, and  I d ivide by the area .


I multip ly by the length, which is .36 .


I multip ly by 425 and I divide by de lta y.


Bu t I need delta y  in cen timeters , so ...


in meters, so  tha t's .2.


And I ge t 7.7 times ten to the ten th.


And that is not bad a t a ll because I think,  from wha t I remember, is that it is 11 times ten to the

tenth.


That's wha t it is.


So tha t is quite amazing for such a crude measurement tha t we do here.


We can also measure the ultima te tensile s treng th .


That is , we can measure the value for F over A when it broke.


So tha t happened , I think ...

wasn't tha t eigh t kilograms? So that will be 80 d ivided by the area that we know , and so that gives

me 80 divided by two  times...


divided by ten to  the minus seven th , and tha t is four times ten  to the eighth new tons per square

meter.


And th is is also new tons per square me ter.


And that's not bad.


It's a little higher than we have there, bu t it's a very crude measuremen t.


And don' t forge t, we were unab le to fo llow the portion when it was go ing down .


We on ly went up in mass , in weigh t, and so tha t value there takes into accoun t tha t the curve

comes down, some thing we could no t do.


We d idn't have the means o f doing that.


The percentage s train is actua lly extremely  low  in the portion that the curve is  linear .


You can ask yourself the ques tion "Wha t is delta l divided by  l in terms o f percentages during th is

portion here?" We ll, we know the leng th, 0 .36 , and when we take the case where we sort o f reach 
the end of the Hooke's Law parame ter space, we have a delta l which is 425 times  lower than 
this, so we have 20 d ivided by 425 , and tha t is , um... 

four poin t seven  times ten to  the minus two , bu t that is  in terms of cen timeters and we wan t it in

terms of me ters, so we have to multip ly by ano ther fac tor ten to the minus two .


So the exponent's changed--


minus two... divided by 0 .36 , and tha t gives me 1.3 times ten  to the minus three.


In terms o f percentages, that wou ld be 0 .13%.


So the wire , when it reaches the end of its Hooke's Law parameter space , has on ly become

longer by 0 .13%.


And when the w ire breaks...


In general, for meta ls it's maybe five or ten percent longer than its original leng th .


That's a typica l value for me tals .


Now, as long as I am in the linear portion of the curve , I can genera te a simple harmon ic motion .


I want to show you that.


I need my wiper .


Because in the linear portion of  the curve where Hooke's Law holds , I cou ld hang a weigh t on the

rope... or on the rod and I could le t it oscillate vertically .


So the  force tha t you have equals y times A times delta l divided by  l.


That's the force tha t I apply .


So the spring  force is opposing that, so the spring force has a minus sign here to indicate the

direction .


And so this  is similar to F equa ls minus kX that you have seen with the spring .


This now  is our k, and delta l is our x.


And so you can predic t tha t it will s tart to oscilla te w ith an angular frequency o f omega square

root of k d ivided by m and with a per iod which is two pi...


two pi times the square roo t of m over k, and m is now the mass tha t I'm hanging here .


If we take our copper wire , we know wha t y  is.


If I take the value 11 ins tead of  the one tha t we found, but it's very close , anyhow ...


So if  I take our copper wire, then I will find , depend ing upon the mass that  I hang on it...


then I'll find in any case for k, for th is value k I find five  times ten  to the fourth new tons per me ter .


So if now  I hang on it a mass of one kilogram, I can ca lculate the period of one oscillation , and

one over the period is the frequency F, and  I be lieve that is something like 38 her tz.


So it wou ld s tart  to oscilla te like this , 38 times per second, and if  I hang two kilograms on it, then

this frequency wou ld become some thing like 25 her tz, because a higher mass gives me a longer

period, gives me a lower frequency .


The speed of sound also depends on Young's modulus.


Without proo f--


you will see  this  if you ever take 803--


I will te ll you tha t the speed o f sound is the square root of Young's modu lus d ivided by the density

of the mater ial.


And I have lis ted those there on the view graph.


Oh, th is is by, yeah , the square roo t--


I have tha t, yeah .


And so the higher Young's modulus is , the higher the speed o f sound is, and  that is  in tuitively sort 
of p leasing. 

I can sort o f understand tha t although the square roo t is hard to see. 

If I have here a rod, a bar and I give th is bar here a bang, I hit it, if this bar were infinitely stiff--

that means Young's modulus were infinitely high--

then the bar wou ld instantaneously move here when  I h it it there. 

Bu t if the bar  is not in fin ite ly stiff, if it has a cer tain amount of elas ticity, then what happens... then 
I h it it here and I produce here some kind o f local increased pressure which is going to propaga te 
to this end--

it's like a pressure wave , like sound is a pressure wave--

and tha t takes time . 

And the larger Young's modu lus is , the stiffer the mater ial is, the  faster that will go. 

If Young's modulus  is very  low , the material is more elastic. 

It will take a longer time for this pulse to reach this end. 

So it is sort of in tuitively pleasing for me tha t the stiffness of the ma terial is rela ted to the speed o f

sound.


I have here a magnesium bar , and the magnesium bar has a leng th l.


And I can calcula te the speed o f sound for magnesium by taking its Young's modulus, wh ich is

there , d ivided by rho, which is there , and I come up with the speed o f sound , which is about five

kilome ters per second.


If you look at those numbers, they are all substantially higher than  the speed of sound in air ,

which is only some 340 me ters per second .


So the speed o f sound for magnesium is some 15 times larger than the speed of sound in a ir.


If th is bar has a leng th l, this pressure dis turbance will s tart to move to the left, and then it'll come

back here , so it will have made a comple te journey , which I call the period ...


It has made a comple te journey  in so many seconds--


2L divided by the speed of sound.


And so the frequency o f th is bar--


the frequency a t which it wou ld like to oscilla te when I g ive it a bang--


is one over T, and  tha t is the speed of sound divided by 2L.


Now, for those o f you who w ill take 803 in the fu ture , you will see a much be tter derivation of this

frequency , so th is is a poor man's version .


The speed of sound is abou t five kilome ters per second . 

The leng th of the bar is abou t 122 centime ters , and so that translates  in to a frequency of roughly 
2,200 , 2,100 hertz. 

So the  frequency for this magnesium bar  is abou t 2,100 her tz, and you can hear tha t. 

It's a beau tiful tone . 

I ho ld it here and  I will bang it here. 

[bar ch imes, tone oscillates] 

Can you hear  it? No? 

[bar ch imes,  tone oscilla tes again] 

You hear  it? 2 ,100 her tz--

beautifu l tone .

Remember earlier in  the course tha t we were wrestling with th is prob lem.


We had a block and we had two s trings attached to it.


Here is one string , here is the block , and here is ano ther string .


And we're going  to pull on th is here with force F.


Nothing was happening , so the tension here , T, is F.


Here, there is bo th the force F plus the weigh t of the ob ject, so here you have... call it T prime

equals F plus Mg .


And so we argued if you increase F and if the strings are identica l tha t it should break first here

and then here , because the breaking poin t where the force is too large for the s tring will occur first

here, then it occurs here , because you have the extra amoun t Mg .


Bu t ye t when we jerked on it very fast, it would break here, and when we pulled very slowly--


I will do it aga in--


it would break here .


And now we can fully understand  that.


Because wha t does it mean,  that  this s tring is going  to break? It means tha t s tring has to ge t

longer by a certa in amount delta l be fore it says, "Sorry , I got to go ," and it breaks.


For this s tring to get longer by a cer tain amoun t delta l,  this block has to come down .


Now, if I pu ll here with a certa in force F--


F equals Ma--


the block w ill come down w ith an accelera tion a , and in the  time delta t, it w ill move over a

distance a delta t squared , which is the delta l tha t this  string will feel.


Bu t tha t takes time to reach the delta l a t which it wan ts to break , and so if I pull very fast, I don' t

give it tha t time .


And that's why, then,  the one at the bottom w ill break , and if I pull very slowly, the one at the top

will break.


So here is a very thin wire--


you can't see it very well--


and here is one , too .


It's a s tring , and they're iden tica l, and this is my emergency safe ty rope.


And if I pull very fast, you see the bottom one breaks.


I have this  in my hand , and the  top one is s till sa fe.


However, if  I repeat this, and I do it very gen tly...


It's always hard to ge t this  in .


There we go.


Uh-oh...


Okay, so now  I'm going to slowly  increase the force.


I g ive the block plen ty o f time to come down , plen ty o f time, and now the upper one goes .


Have a good weekend.


See you Monday.
