8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 23 

The speed of sound is 340 me ters per second--


it depends a little b it on the tempera ture--


about 770 miles per hour.


When I speak to you, my sound reaches you with tha t speed.


I produce a certain frequency here, a cer tain number o f oscilla tions per second .


They reach you , your eardrum star ts to oscilla te with the same frequency and you hear tha t tone.


I have here a tuning fork which oscillates 440  times per second.


[tun ing fork produces  med ium-p itched tone ]


Your eardrum oscilla tes 440 times per second--


you hear th is tone .


Here I have 256 oscillations per second.


[me tal rod emits lower tone ]


Your eardrum is now shaking, going back and forth 256 times per second.


If you s tay where you are and you don' t move and I move these tuning forks, you w ill hear a

differen t frequency and that's wha t we call Doppler effect.


If my sound source approaches you , you will hear a frequency f prime which is  larger than the

frequency of the tun ing fork.


If it moves away from you , which I will call receding , then f prime equa ls lower... lower frequency .


For ins tance , I move  to you a sound source--


I call tha t a  transmitter--


with a speed of abou t one meters per second.


Transmitter is the sound transmitter .


Then if it approaches you here, you will hear f pr ime , which is 1.003 times f.


This three here is the one par t out o f 340 tha t you ge t an increase in frequency.


If I move it away from you, then f prime would be 0 .997 times the frequency of  the source itself.


You stay where you are.


I have here a tuning fork which generates 4 ,000 hertz , a very high frequency.


If I move it to you with the speed o f one me ter per second, which I can do,  then you get an

increase in pitch of 0 .3%.


That makes it 4,012 hertz .


And when I move it away from you there is a decrease of 0 .3%.


And you can clearly hear tha t d ifference .


I will firs t make you listen to the 4 ,000 her tz without my moving .


[tun ing fork produces  very high pitched tone]


Can you hear  it? Very high frequency.


Is it pain ful, really? High frequency.


Most o f you are young enough you should be able to hear 4 ,000 hertz .


Okay, now I am go ing to move it to you one meter per second and away from you .


[high tone goes up and down  slightly in p itch ]


Did you hear  it? Once more .


[tone goes up and down  quickly aga in]


[class laughs]


When it comes to you, it's clear that the frequency goes up, and when it moves away from you ,

the frequency is down .


Now imagine tha t I'm going to ro tate the sound source around in a circle .


Now the sound tha t you rece ive, the frequency that you receive will change in a sinuso idal

fashion .


If th is is that circle , and this  is the radius o f tha t circle , and if you are here in the p lane o f the

circle, then when the source comes straight to you with the velocity v-- le t's say  it's a uniform

circular motion--


f prime will be larger than  f and it will, in th is case , reach a maximum.


When it is at 90 degrees rela tive to you--


I don't have to give it a vec tor nota tion--


f prime equals f.


When it moves away from you , f prime is smaller than f, you hear a minimum.


And when it is here aga in--


when the angle between the velocity and your direc tion is again 90 degrees-- then f prime equals

f again .


And so this phenomenon is called the Doppler effect.


So if  I twirl it around, you will hear a sinuso idal fluctua tion in f prime .


Suppose  I p lot, as a function o f time , f prime the way you will rece ive it-- you sit s till, bu t I'm go ing

to move the sound source around like this .


Then you w ill have a curve that looks someth ing like th is: some s inusoida l-cosinusoidal

fluctuation of f prime .


This w ill be the value f produced by the sound source itself.


This w ill be f prime max imum and this w ill be f prime minimum.


If you could record this , there is an amaz ing number o f  things that you can deduce from this

curve.


First of all, you can take ...


You can measure f pr ime max divided by F, because you see th is curve , so you know what f is

here, you see wha t f prime max  is , and tha t should allow you to retrieve immed iate ly v velocity o f

the transmitter .


If that number were 1.003, then you know tha t the speed in the orb it was one me ter per second.


So th is ra tio immedia tely gives you  the transmitter velocity.


This time separa tion gives you immed iately the period of ro ta tion , but since two p i R-- if R  is the

radius div ided by the velocity o f the  transmitter--


since that is the ... oh , I can reverse it, it doesn't matter.


Two p i R divided by the time  to go around is the velocity of the transmitter .


Since you know the velocity of the transmitter from this  ratio since you know  the period , which is

this, you now also find the radius R .


So from tha t curve-- and keep that with you, because it's going to be impor tan t in what  follows--


we can derive three things: the radius, the per iod of rotation and  the speed of the objec t as I tw irl

it around .


I have here wha t we ca ll a w ind organ .


When I twir l this around , it produces a particular tone.


We will ta lk la ter abou t 801 why it produces a particu lar tone.


Sometimes you hear two tones .


I'll try to make you hear on ly one.


And as I sw irl it around , the sound is coming ...


the sound source, the transmitter  is coming to you.


This, when it goes  like this , it's 90-degree angle so you should not hear any Doppler shift.


When it is here, it's moved away from you and so you hear a sinusoidal change in f prime .


Try to hear tha t.


[wind organ producing tone  that changes pitch]


Can you hear , when it's coming to you , tha t it's higher-p itched than when it's going away from

you? Can you hear that? Just say no if you don't hear  it.


Not very clear .


[wind organ aga in producing  varying tone]


For me , it's  impossible to hear because  I'm standing right under  it, of course.


Well, I tried .


I now want to change to elec tromagne tic waves.


Elec tromagne tic waves travel with the speed of light, which is 300 ,000 kilome ters per second .


And if you wan t to treat that correctly , you would have to use special rela tivity.


In the case of sound , I stressed repea tedly that you in the aud ience should no t move bu t tha t the

sound source is moving.


In the case of elec tromagne tic radia tion when you deal with the speed o f ligh t, you don' t have to

ask tha t question .


It is a mean ingless ques tion in special rela tivity.


To ask whe ther you are moving rela tive to me or whether I am moving relative  to you, it doesn't

matter .


All that matters  in special rela tivity is the re lative mo tion , so you can a lways think of yourself as

standing still and make the source of elec tromagne tic radiation move  to you, or away from you ,

relative to you .


Elec tromagne tic radia tion is optical ligh t, in frared , u ltrav iolet, radio , x-rays, gamma rays.


All o f tha t is electromagne tic radia tion .


If the velocity of  the source o f electromagnetic rad iation--


the transmitter--


if tha t is way , way smaller than the speed o f ligh t,  then it is very easy to pred ict the change in

frequency due to Doppler sh ift.


Let this be the transmitter which produces frequency f, and here is the receiver which receives 
the frequency f prime . 

And le t the velocity o f the source of electromagne tic radiation be v--

I cou ld put transmitter here, bu t we can drop that index--

and let th is angle be the ta . 

Then th is is the component in your direction--

we call that  the radial component--

which is v cosine the ta. 

So I dele te the tr.


This  is jus t the velocity of the source rela tive to you at  that angle .


If now we wan t to know what f prime is,  then f prime equals f times one plus v over c times the

cosine o f the ta .


What matters  is on ly the radial component of  the ve locity.


This  is the radial componen t.


If theta is 90 degrees , just like we had with sound,  then f prime equals f.


So 90 degrees , the cosine of  theta is zero,  f prime equals f.


If theta is sma ller than 90 degrees, then it's coming towards you,  then f prime equals  larger than f.


If theta equals  larger than 90 degrees, it's going away from you, then f prime equals sma ller than 
f.


You would ge t a similar equa tion for sound by replacing th is c by the speed of sound.


Bu t I want to s tress that this only holds for elec tromagnetic radia tion if v over c  is much , much

smaller than one .


Now, when we deal with sound , there is some thing mechanically oscilla ting .


Something is v ibrating.


With electromagne tic radia tion , charges are vibra ting.


Elec trons are vibra ting, and they are vibra ting with a certain frequency, and that means there is a

certain period o f one oscilla tion .


And that period o f one oscilla tion is , o f course, one over the  frequency.


I can ask myself now the ques tion , how far does elec tromagnetic radia tion, how far does  light

travel in the  time o f one period capital T? Well, it goes with the speed o f ligh t, so in T seconds, it 
moves a dis tance cT. 

And that dis tance we ca ll the waveleng th o f elec tromagnetic radia tion , lambda equa ls cT, for 
which you can also write c divided by F. 

So th is is the wave leng th of the e lectromagnetic radiation--

the speed of light, 300 ,000 kilome ters per second--

the period o f one oscilla tion , say , of the e lectrons , and this is the  frequency , wh ich you can give in 
hertz. 

I cou ld g ive you a specific examp le. 

I, for  ins tance , can  take a per iod T of two times ten to the minus 15 seconds. 

That wou ld give me a wavelength o f abou t six times ten to  the minus seven me ters--

six times ten to the minus seven me ters--

and tha t you wou ld experience as red ligh t. 

If I make the period shor ter--

say, 1 .3 times ten to the minus 15 seconds--

I ge t a shorter wavelength . 

I ge t four times ten to  the minus seven meters, and you would experience tha t as blue ligh t. 

In as tronomy, in op tical as tronomy we canno t measure the period or the  frequency of op tical light. 

All we can measure is the waveleng th . 

And so if I wan t to use this equation, then I have to replace f prime by c divided by  lambda prime

and f I have to replace by c divided by lambda.


And when I do  that, I ge t the fo llowing resu lt.


I ge t lambda prime equa ls lambda times one minus v over c cosine theta.


If th is is a plus , this  is a minus .


Check that for yourself.


You have to use the small number approxima tion,


the Taylor expansion, namely that v over c  is much, much sma ller than one.


So you can see now  if the objec t comes to you , in other words, if f prime is  larger than f, if the

frequency  is h igher , then the waveleng th will be smaller .


And so let me wr ite that down.


When the cosine o f the ta...


so the ob ject is coming to you--


when the cosine of  theta is  larger than zero, the object is approaching you , then the wavelength 
lambda pr ime will be less than lambda . 

And that has a name-- we call that blue shift.


And the reason why we call that blue shift is that if the waveleng ths become shor ter, it moves

towards the blue end of the spec trum, because blue has a lower waveleng th than red.


If cosine theta is nega tive , then  the objec t is receding from you, then lambda prime is larger than

lambda, and we call that red shift.


These are the terms tha t astronomers use a ll the  time.


When you make a spectrum o f a s tar--


you can do tha t using prisms or by o ther means--


and you look a t the light in tensity as a func tion o f wave length--


so here is the light in tensity as a func tion o f wave leng th--


then you may expec t to see some kind of a continuum.


Bu t, in fac t, wha t you do see is ...


Superimposed on a con tinuum you see some times very sharp absorption lines--


black, missing ligh t, called absorption lines And these absorption lines correspond to elemen ts in

the atmosphere o f the star .


In fact, if you see the absorp tion lines, you can tell what kind of elements are present in the s tar.


Some are very characteris tic absorption lines : some  for hydrogen , some  for calcium, some  for

silicon, some for magnesium and so on.


It's actua lly  interesting tha t when you look a t the spec trum of the sun--


when people did  tha t first, when they had the means o f doing tha t, they found absorption lines  in

the spectrum of the sun which could not be iden tified .


They had never been seen here on Ear th, these lines , and so they called these lines a fter the

sun.


The sun is Helios, and so they called it helium.


So helium was firs t d iscovered on the sun before it was  la ter d iscovered on Ear th by  looking at

the absorption lines o f the solar spectrum.


If a s tar moves to you , then a ll the lines--


every single line-- will be blue-shifted.


And if the star moves away from you, all the lines will be red-shifted.


If you take an example : With lambda prime d ivided by  lambda and you pick any one o f those

lines--


it doesn't matter which you pick because they will all do exactly the same .


If th is were , for  ins tance , 1 .00333--


I just pick a very n ice number; that means  lambda prime, as you see, is  larger than lambda ; the

waveleng ths get longer, so we have a red sh ift--


and you substitu te that in that equation, then you'll find that  the velocity a t which tha t star  is

moving rela tive to you--


that gives you immedia tely the answer  there--


equals minus 0 .00333 times the speed o f ligh t, c, and that is minus 100 kilome ters per second.


And the minus, then, reminds you tha t the object is receding from you.


So tha t gives you a red shift.


I just wrote down tha t the velocity v  is minus 100 kilometers per second .


It's , o f course, v cosine  the ta tha t is minus 100 kilome ters per second .


It's the radial ve locity-- that's all you can measure .


You have no in forma tion on the ta.


So it is th is component, v cosine theta--


which we call  the radial velocity--


that is minus 100 kilome ters per second .


Half of all the stars  in the sky are binaries, and so when you look at the spec tra, you will see them

go around each o ther .


And so you , in princip le, can measure the red shifts and the b lue shifts as they go around each

other .


You see Doppler e ffec t.


If they come to you , you see blue shift.


If they go away from you , you see red sh ift.


So , in principle , you can de termine for each one o f those stars the velocity  in orbit, the radius of

their orbit and, o f course , the period o f the binary system.


So it's an extremely power ful tool in astronomy  if you have a binary system, when the s tars

exactly do this , to determine all these quantities that you would like to know.


I first wou ld like to show you now some slides .


The first slide... oh , I have to lower the screen, by the way.


That wou ld help , wouldn' t it?


[chuckles]


The first slide is a spectrum made in the laboratory o f hydrogen, helium and calcium and sodium.


It shows you emission lines, no absorp tion lines.


These lines are produced by  lamps, and the frequenc ies are very well known .


Here you see the famous sod ium yellow  lines .


So here is the red part o f the spectrum and there is the blue part of  the spectrum.


So we know these frequencies , we know these wavelengths very well.


And here you see the spectrum of the sun with all  these absorp tion lines tha t I men tioned to you .


It's plas tered with absorption lines , and each o f them can be identified.


These are due to calcium, iron , hydrogen and so on.


Here is the blue part of  the spectrum, here is the green part,  the green part, and here is the red

part of the spec trum.


And here you see the basic  idea beh ind a b inary system.


Suppose you have a binary system tha t on ly one s tar  is visible and  the other one is  invisible and

the one star shows you  three clear absorption lines .


Then as the star moves around the center o f mass , you see tha t all these lines drift in unison .


And ou t o f th is in formation you get the radius,  the ve loc ity and the period, assuming that you are

on Earth in  the plane o f the orbit of the s tars.


If you have a b inary system whereby bo th s tars are visible so you get  the spectrum of bo th s tars,

then you see the Dopp ler shift o f both stars in the spectrum.


Here we have a simp le case  that we only have two absorption lines, no t to confuse the issue, and

so in one ...


in the case o f one s tar,  the shift will be towards the le ft of the two lines, bu t the o ther star , the shift

will be to the right, because if you have a b inary system when one star comes to you, the o ther 
star goes away from you, and vice versa. 

So now you are very  lucky, now you have an ideal situation that you can find for both stars the 
radius o f the orbit,  the velocity in orb it and the period for each s tar, which , of course , is the same 
for both . 

And here you see rea l data .


You see here,  first of all, the emission lines which are measured in the labora tory tha t I just

showed you .


They are always done simultaneously w ith  the measuremen ts.


You always must be sure  tha t you have a good calibration o f your wavelength.


And th is spec trum a , the top spec trum, is of a star , a binary system, that has a period of 20 .5 
days. 

And you see here single lines , if you have good eyes.


That means at this very moment bo th s tars move rela tive to you at angles of 90 degrees , so you

don't see any Doppler shift.


Bu t now look here .


Later  in time , you see that  this  line has split in two lines and th is one has also split in two lines.


Clearly, one componen t is coming to you and the o ther component is moving away from you .


And so you ge t all this use ful in formation in astronomy by mak ing the Doppler sh ift

measuremen ts o f binary systems.


I want to pursue  the idea o f b inary s tars.


They g ive us no t only the in formation tha t we want regarding the orbits, bu t there is even more

that we can ge t ou t of it which is even more exciting.


So I will remind you wha t a b inary system looks  like .


Remember the second exam.


I'm sure you w ill never forge t tha t second exam and maybe never forg ive me for that.


Binary system: star one , radius r1, mass m1, velocity v1, and s tar two-- going about their

common center of mass--


mass m2 , rad ius r2 and velocity v2 .


m1 r1 equals m2 r2 .


That's the way the center of mass is de fined.


Imagine that you as an observer are somewhere in the plane of this orb it, and you are here .


And you are observing the system going around.


Kepler's Th ird Law, which you derived on your exam as well as on an assignment: the period

squared equals four pi squared  times r1 plus r2 to the power three.


divided by G times m1 plus m2.


Let me check tha t to make sure I have that righ t.


Yes,  that is correct.


Imagine now you can make the Doppler shift measuremen ts o f both stars.


You make the Dopp ler shift measuremen t of star number one , so you measure lambda one prime

as a func tion o f time.


Out of  tha t pops immedia tely the period o f ro tation .


Out of  tha t pops the velocity, as we discussed .


Out of  tha t pops the radius , r1 .


And now you measure the Doppler shift o f s tar two as a function o f time .


Out of  tha t pops the period which , of course, be tter be  the same.


Out of  tha t pops its ve locity  in orbit and out o f it pops  its radius .


All these things come out o f the Dopp ler sh ift measuremen ts, bu t if you know r1 and you know r2 ,

then you also know r1 plus r2, so you know this part in Kepler's Th ird Law.


Since you also know the periods, you can find wha t m1 plus m2 is .


So now you get an extra bonus.


You know now wha t the sum o f the mass o f the two stars is in  the binary sys tem, bu t you also

know that m1 r1 is m2 r2 .


So now you have two equa tions .


You know wha t m1 plus m2 is and you know this equa tion, and you can solve  for m1 and m2,

which is an amazing th ing when you come  to think o f it.


So we finally end up with the mass of star one and the mass o f s tar two .


All this comes out o f Doppler shift measuremen ts: the velocities, the rad ii,  the periods and even

the masses of  these objec ts.


Now, if you as an observer on Earth are no t exac tly  in the plane of the orb it, then the situation is a

little bit more complica ted , and I will no t discuss that here today because, in principle , it doesn' t

affec t the idea behind Doppler sh ift.


Bu t for as tronomers, it is very  importan t.


It's really a nuisance , but I will not discuss tha t in any detail.


I want to discuss a fascina ting applica tion that we have in x-ray astronomy .


Namely , we have x-ray binaries .


What is an x-ray binary? We ll, it is a binary system.


This  is a star no t unlike our sun.


It has as certain mass, has a certa in radius , and it is in orbit, let's say, with a neu tron star , even

though it could be a b lack ho le.


Bu t for now, le t's just assume it is a neu tron star .


And if these two masses are the same , which I only use for  the sake o f simp licity--


in prac tice,  they could be very different--


then there is a poin t between these  two, right in the middle, whereby the gravita tional pull in one 
direction is the same as the gravitational pu ll in the o ther direction . 

And we call that the inner Lagrang ian poin t.


In o ther words , if you were there , the neu tron star would pull a t you w ith exac tly the same force

as the o ther star .


So you wouldn' t know where to go .


If th is inner Legrangian poin t lies below the sur face of this star , tha t means if the stars are a little

closer than I have drawn them here , then the ma tter o f this s tar will fall towards the neu tron s tar ,

because the pull in  this direction is, then, larger than the pull in this direction .


Now, of course,  this system is a binary sys tem.


They go around in the plane of the b lackboard , say , and so this matter cannot  fall radially  in but it

will fall in and sp iral in and forms what we call an accretion d isk around the neu tron s tar .


This  is called the accretor and  this  is called the donor.


There is mass transfer from the donor to the neutron s tar.


Oops, I jus t noticed I misspe lled the word "accretion." There is an "r" in "accretion ." And as that

occurs, there is a tremendous amount o f energy tha t is released.


I want to blow up the neu tron star .


Very simple 801 cons idera tions , now.


What comes is extreme ly pedestrian.


This  is the mass of the neutron s tar and this  is the radius of the neutron s tar.


And I take a little bit o f ma tter m, and I drop it from a large dis tance on to the neu tron star .


At wha t speed will  tha t little piece o f ma tter reach the neutron star? You should almos t be ab le to

close your eyes and g ive me that answer righ t now.


The kinetic energy when it reaches the neu tron star equals one-half m v squared .


That is the speed a t which it will crash on to the neutron star , and tha t mus t be mM neutron star G

divided by the radius of  the neu tron s tar.


You always  lose your m, and so you find tha t the speed at which it reaches the neu tron star  is the

square roo t o f two M neutron s tar times G divided by R neutron star .


You should remember this equation.


This was the equa tion that we had for escape velocity.


If you were here, and you go back to in finity, you reach exactly tha t speed, so if you fa ll in from

infin ity that is exactly the speed a t which you reach the neutron star .


It should obv iously be the same number.


And you don' t rea lly have to be infinitely far away ; you just have to be much further away than the

radius o f the neu tron star .


When this matter crashes on to the neutron star, the kinetic energy tha t is released is one-half mv

squared.


It is converted  to heat, and to give you some feeling for the incredible power o f a neutron star, if 
you make this  little m as little as ten grams--

think of it as a pretty full-sized marshmallow--

and you throw a marshmallow  from a large dis tance on to a neutron star, the energy that is 
released is comparab le to the a tomic bomb tha t was used on Hiroshima . 

A ten-gram objec t thrown on to a neutron s tar--

the reason being  that  this ve locity becomes enormously high . 

If you put in  for the neu tron star a mass of abou t three times ten  to the 30 th kilograms, and you 
take for the radius o f the neu tron star abou t ten kilome ters, you will find  that  tha t velocity 
becomes abou t two times ten to the e igh th me ters per second, which is about 70% o f the speed 
of ligh t. 

And because o f this enormous speed--


one-half mv squared is horrendously high--


it is a conversion o f grav ita tional potential energy to kinetic energy and then u ltima tely to heat.


Now, nature is transferring mass a t an extraord inarily high ra te in many o f these binary systems.


There are a t leas t some hundred or so tha t we know  in our own galaxy.


The mass trans fer ra te , wh ich I ca ll dm/d t--


so tha t is the transfer rate  from the donor onto the neu tron star--


that  transfer rate is rough ly ten to  the 14th kilograms per second.


It is a horrendous mass trans fer ra te .


You can ca lcula te--


by mu ltiplying it with one-half v squared--


how many  joules per second are re leased in the form o f kinetic energy .


That means  in the  form o f heat.


And I call  that  the power of that neu tron star , and tha t, then, for this mass trans fer ra te , tha t's

about two times ten to the 30 th joules per second, which is watts.


And that is abou t 5 ,000 times larger than  the power of our own sun .


Bu t the tempera ture o f this neu tron s tar--


because o f this enormous amoun t o f energy released , the temperature would reach va lues of 
about ten million degrees Kelvin, and a t tha t h igh temperature , the neu tron star would emit a lmost 
exclusively x-rays. 

You and I are very cold bodies, on ly 300 degrees Kelvin. 

We rad iate electromagne tic radia tion in the in frared par t o f the spec trum. 

We have warm bodies . 

When you hold someone in your arms, you can fee l tha t. 

If I wou ld heat you up to 3 ,000 degrees Kelvin , you would become red-ho t. 

And you actua lly... 

we could  turn the light o ff and I wou ld see you . 

You're jus t emitting red ligh t. 

If I wou ld heat you up to  three million degrees, you wou ld start to beg in to radia te in x-rays. 

You may no t like it, but  tha t's a de tail, of course. 

So I wan t you  to apprecia te the  fact that the... 

the k ind of radia tion tha t you ge t depends strongly on the temperature, and a t ten million degrees

you're dea ling almost exclusive ly with x-rays.


So these binary systems are very potent sources of x-rays.


The neutron s tars ro tate around, we discussed that earlier--


conservation o f angular momentum--


and they have s trong magne tic fie lds.


The ma tter tha t falls on to the neu tron star


already heats up during  the infall because there is gravitational po ten tial energy released, and so

the ma tter is so hot that, in general, it's highly  ionized .


And high ly ionized mater ial canno t reach a magne tic neutron star  in all loca tions that it prefers to

do so.


In 802, you will learn why tha t's the case .


However, the ma tter can reach the neu tron star at  the magne tic poles .


And so what you're going to see now is you're going to have a neu tron star with magnetic poles,

so the ma tter streams  in onto the magne tic poles, which gives you two ho t spo ts.


And if the axis o f rota tion doesn't coincide with the line through the two hot spots , if the neutron

star ro tates, you're going to see x-ray pu lsations.


When the ho t spot is here, you will see x-rays, and when the hot spot is here , you will not see x-

rays.


And so we observe from these systems x-ray pulsa tions.


Now think of the following .


The x-ray pulsa tions are a clock.


It is the clock of the ro ta ting neu tron star .


If the neutron star in a binary system--


because a ll of these are in a binary system, these x-ray binaries--


if it's coming to you , you see Doppler shift.


The ticks o f the clock come a little c loser toge ther .


If the neutron star moves away from you , the  ticks o f the clocks are a little b it further apar t.


That is exactly wha t Doppler shift is all abou t.


So by timing the pulses of the x-rays, you can get a handle on the Dopp ler shift o f the neu tron

star.


That means you can ge t the speed o f the neu tron star , you can get  the radius of the orbit, and 
you can get  the period , just like we discussed before. 

Bu t now you take an op tica l...


The x-ray observations, by the way , have to be made from outside the Earth's a tmosphere,

because x-rays are absorbed by the Ear th's a tmosphere.


Now you take an op tical telescope and you look from the ground , and now you see the op tical

spectrum o f the donor .


And wha t do you see in the donor? You see these absorption lines.


And as the donor moves around the cen ter of mass, these absorp tion lines move back and forth.


The Doppler shift o f the donor .


So you know the velocity o f the donor, you know the radius o f the donor ...


not the radius o f the donor--


you know the rad ius o f the orbit, and you know the period.


So now we have a situa tion that I jus t described earlier  that you have the Doppler shift of bo th

objects , and remember , I told you that you also ge t the masses.


You ge t the mass o f the donor and the mass of the acc retor. 

Be fore I go ahead , let me show you some s lides . 

So we have to lower th is again , if that's possible-- yep.


I want to show you an artis t's conception o f such a binary system.


So th is is wha t it may  look  like .


You see the donor there and you see the neu tron star right here , so small, o f course, that it's

invisible .


And th is is the accre tion disk .


Swirls  in , the matter ends up on the neu tron s tar .


And th is is ano ther view tha t gives you an idea of the donor and  then the swirl o f ma tter, and then

it sw irls in and ends up here on the neutron s tar.


And here you see data that were ob tained in 1971.


It's clear evidence for  the existence o f these rotating neutron stars w ith  these x-ray ho t spo ts.


You see here the observed x-ray in tensity as a function of time.


And the ac tual da ta are these very thin lines.


And th is bo ld line was drawn over by the authors to convince you that you see a signal which is

highly period ic.


The time from here to here is 1.24 seconds .


This object was called Hercules X-1.


So th is is one of  the magnetic po les and this  is the o ther magnetic po le.


One magnetic po le and the o ther magnetic po le.


So you see here unmis takably the ro ta tion of  the neu tron star and  the x-ray pulsa tions .


Here you see data  from  the same object, but now the time sca le is very d ifferen t.


From here to here is one day .


This  is two days.


And when you look at  this data alone , forge t this for now, notice  that you see the source is ac tive

in x-rays--

the 1.42-second oscilla tions you canno t see , of course, anymore because the time scale is 
differen t, bu t notice here there are no x-rays a t all: 1 .7 days la ter, no x-rays at all. 

1.7 days later , no x-rays a t all.


And so what you're looking a t here are what we call x-ray eclipses .


When the neu tron star moves behind the donor s tar, all the x-rays are absorbed by the donor s tar

and you ge t x-ray eclipses .


In o ther words , you ge t...


Independen tly from the Dopp ler shift you also ge t the period o f the orbit by the x-ray eclipses.


And th is rea lly changed our whole concep t of astronomy, the existence o f these neu tron star

binaries.


And now comes a par t, wha t are  the masses of  these objects? I already alluded you to  the idea o f 
the possibility that there may be black holes. 

All the mass measurements that have been done to date of  these neu tron s tars where you see 
the pulsa tions ...


all o f them are very close to 1 .4 solar mass .


And there's a good reason  for tha t-- that's no t an accident.


In 1930 , the physicist Chandrasekhar predicted tha t wh ite dwarfs could no t exist if their mass is

larger than 1.4 solar mass.


It was a quantum mechanica l calcu lation for which he received in 1983 the Nobel Prize .


Remember we discussed white dwarfs earlier .


A white dwarf has abou t a radius o f 10,000 kilometers , about the same as the Earth .


And imagine tha t you have a white dwarf, and you add matter to  the white dwarf and you pass the

1.4-solar-mass mark.


Then the wh ite dwar f w ill collapse and becomes a neu tron star .


And so when we measure  the masses of neu tron stars , it  turns out, maybe somewha t by surprise ,

that  they're all very close to 1 .4 .


If you could add more ma tter to the neu tron star by acc reting more and more matter and you

reach the poin t tha t the neu tron star becomes as massive as three times the mass of the sun , we 
believe that the neutron star can no longer support itse lf and becomes a black hole . 

And so now comes the question, wha t is a black hole? A black hole is the most bizarre objec t tha t 
you can imagine , and it is someth ing tha t you want to s tay away from, too .


A black hole has no size , unlike a neu tron s tar.


It has no size , bu t it does have mass, and it has a lo t of mass--


three times the mass o f the sun , ten times the mass of  the sun, a hundred  times the mass o f the

sun.


So it has mass, but it has no size .


We identify around  the black hole a sphere w ith radius R which we call the event horizon .


Imagine you are at the event horizon and you wan t to get away from the black hole .


What kind o f speed do you need? You shou ld be able to give me tha t answer immediate ly.


The escape ve locity must be 2 MG div ided by the radius of that even t horizon .


In o ther words , the radius of  the event horizon itself equals 2 MG divided by c squared.


If you tell me wha t m is, I will tell you wha t the rad ius o f the event horizon is .


I went a little fast here .


I skipped an importan t s tep .


v is the escape velocity from  the event horizon, which is at a distance cap ita l R from the mass M.


So we see tha t here.


Now, this escape velocity can never be larger than the speed o f ligh t, so the maximum va lue

possible is c.


And if now you look a t this part o f this equa tion and you take the radius on one s ide, you'll get

that  the radius of the event horizon equals 2 MG divided by c squared , and tha t's how I found tha t

equation.


Sorry tha t I went a little too fast.


If M is the mass o f the Ear th, the radius of the event horizon is one centimeter .


If M is the mass o f the sun , the radius o f the even t horizon is three kilome ters.


If M is three times the mass o f the sun , the radius of  the even t horizon would become ten

kilome ters.


It scales  linear ly with the mass.


If you were inside the event horizon , you cou ld never escape the b lack ho le because you would

need a speed wh ich is  larger than the speed o f ligh t.


Therefore, you can never escape  from inside the even t horizon.


Nothing can ge t out o f it, not x-rays, no rad io emission, no light, nothing .


Once you're inside the even t horizon , you've had it.


You canno t escape it.


And so the ques tion now that comes up: Can we see x-rays from a black hole? Because if

nothing can come out o f a black hole, how can we see x-rays? And the answer  is yes, we can,

because as  long as the ma tter that swirls  in is ou tside  the even t horizon , it would still be very ho t. 

Because gravitational po ten tial energy wou ld already have been released, it would be very ho t 
and it would emit x-rays. 

So we can see x-rays ou tside a black hole . 

However, you w ill never see pulsations, because a black hole has no sur face , like a neutron star . 

So there's no such thing as two hot spots which ro tate around. 

And so now comes the prob lem for astronomers: How can you determine the mass o f the 
accretor if the accretor is no t a pu lsating neutron s tar but if the accre tor  is a black hole? Well, you 
can only now measure the Doppler sh ift of the donor, because the donor , in general, is quite well 
visible. 

It's an optical s tar.


Bu t you will not be able  to measure  the Doppler shift o f the black hole-- no pulsations.


If, however, an astronomer can make an es tima te o f the mass o f tha t donor,  then you w ill find the

mass o f the accretor.


In o ther words , instead o f having the Doppler shift measuremen ts o f both stars--


the neu tron s tar and the donor star, which gives you the mass o f two stars--


now you have to se ttle for the Dopp ler sh ift o f only the donor and the mass o f the donor  itself.


And if you have a reasonab le idea of wha t tha t mass will be , then you can find the mass o f the

accretor.


And there is a very famous case that was the  first one discovered in  the early '70s, which is ca lled

Cygnus X-1.


Cygnus X-1 is an x-ray binary wh ich has an orbital period o f 5 .6 days.


The Doppler shift measuremen ts o f the donor were made, and astronomers simply  looking a t the

spectrum--


at the absorp tion lines and the struc ture of the absorption lines and the kind of absorp tion lines--


were able to say, "Yeah, the mass of the donor  is probably approximate ly 30 solar masses." And

with that in formation and with the Doppler shift, you can now arrive at the mass of the accre tor,

and tha t is , in this case...


oh, by the way there is an r missing in the word "accretion" there--


that mass turns out to be about 15 solar masses.


Now, when th is was found in the ear ly '70s , most people concluded this has to be a black hole .


It is a very compact objec t.


Otherw ise it wouldn't emit x-rays in  the firs t p lace.


And clearly , if the mass o f that compact objec t is way  larger than three solar masses, then there

is no doub t in our minds that  this  is a black hole .


Since that time, many b lack ho le x-ray binaries have been discovered .


So , if I summarize , the amazing thing is from studying the Doppler sh ift of binary systems like x-

ray binaries, you can derive the orbital parameters, orbital radius , orb ita l periods,  the speed of the 
stars in orbit, bu t you can also  find the masses. 

And whenever you make a measuremen t o f the mass when it is a neu tron star when you see the 
x-ray pulsations, you almost always find that it is very close to 1 .4 times the mass o f the sun . 

Bu t in a few cases , you will find tha t the mass is substantially larger.


Admitted ly you have to do withou t the Doppler shift, then, o f the accre tor, bu t you have  to use

some other in forma tion , and then you can conclude in most cases w ith pre tty good con fidence

that you're dea ling with some thing like...


bizarre as a b lack ho le, which you can only define the event horizon ...


And you can never escape a black hole when you're inside the event horizon, because that is

when the escape velocity would be larger than the speed o f ligh t.


So th is is the escape veloc ity .


If you se t that equa l to c, then you can solve for the rad ius o f the even t hor izon, and ou t of it pops

this equa tion .


I would like to show you now a slide of Cygnus X-1, which is the oldes t known black hole x-ray

binary.


I have to lower the screen .


And there it comes.


This was really a bombshell when this was discovered .


I s till remember reading that  first publication.


Two people discovered  this  independen tly, by the way .


They came independen tly to  the same conclusion.


Tom Bolton and it was Paul Merlin--


two independen t groups.


All righ t, here is an op tical picture-- it is a nega tive , so you see the s tars dark and you see the sky

bright--


and right here is the star that is Cygnus X-1 .


It is the donor.


It is a very  large star , a superg ian t, huge radius, and it is believed to have a mass o f 30 times that

of the sun .


You see here the close-up .


This  is no t the companion, believe me .


This  is jus t an image o f that star .


The position was... it was hard  to get an accurate position.


Various groups made a major con tribu tion  to finding the position .


One o f the rocke t flights of MIT found a position  that is quite precise and there was no doubt 
later ... 

When the orbital period was found o f 5 .6 days, there was no doub t tha t this was the x-ray source . 

And so this  is a system whereby you can only see  the donor in the op tical ligh t. 

You can measure the Doppler shift o f the donor, and by looking a t the spectrum of  this s tar alone , 
you come to the conclus ion tha t the mass must be about 30 solar masses, and then you can 
argue tha t the invisib le x-ray source mus t be a black ho le.
