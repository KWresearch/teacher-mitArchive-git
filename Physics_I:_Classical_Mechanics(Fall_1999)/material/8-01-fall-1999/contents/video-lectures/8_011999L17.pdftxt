8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript – Lecture 17 

Remember , earlier  in the course we measured the average speed o f a bulle t which we fired  from

a rifle.


That was because we had the ab ility o f very fast timing.


In the old days , fast timing was not possible and people measured the speed o f bulle ts  in a very

delicate way and all the tools tha t we have learned we can app ly now  to this device which we call

the ballistic pendulum.


We have a pendulum w ith a very heavy object hanging here a t the end--


I call it the b lock.


You see it here .


And th is pendulum has  leng th L.


Ours is abou t one me ter .


I will give you the exact numbers  la ter.


And we have a bulle t of mass little m and the bulle t comes  in w ith velocity v .


It ge ts comple tely absorbed, sticks  in there .


It's a complete ly inelastic collision , and the pendulum w ill then pick up the velocity v prime with

the bullet inside.


The bulle t is somewhere here.


Momen tum is conserved, so we c learly have tha t, m v equals (m plus M) times v pr ime .


So if you could measure v prime , then you could measure the speed of the bulle t, which is v.


How do we measure v prime? Well, we wait for the pendulum  to come to a ha lt, let's say here ,

when the speed is zero .


When it was here, it had a speed v prime .


And we know tha t there was kine tic energy here--


no gravita tiona l po ten tia l energy.


I can call  this  level U = 0 , but righ t here , if th is difference in height is h, then all the kinetic energy

has been conver ted to gravitationa l po ten tia l energy.


So we apply the  theorem,  the work-energy theorem, or you could say... and it's equally valid, you

could say we applied the conservation of mechanica l energy.


And so this kine tic energy, which is one-ha lf (m plus M) times v prime squared is now converted

exclusively to gravita tional po tential energy , wh ich equals (m plus M) times g  times tha t h .


And we lose our (m plus M) , so v pr ime wou ld be the square roo t of 2gh .


And so a ll you would have to measure h, and  then you know v pr ime , and if you know v prime ,

you know the speed o f the bu lle t.


Bu t life is no t tha t simple.


It's very difficult  to measure h , and I can make you see that.


Suppose  this angle--


angle the ta--


when it comes to a ha lt is only two degrees .


Then h, which is L times (1 minus cosine theta) , is on ly 0.6 millime ters for the dimensions tha t I

have chosen here for a length o f one me ter.


And you can't even see it--


it's invisible--


let alone tha t you can measure it to any degree o f accuracy.


So wha t are we going to do now? Well, we are going to not measure h, bu t we are going to

measure x.


I call this x = 0 .


And here , when the pendulum comes to a halt, I ca ll that x .


For a two-degree ang le, x  is approximate ly 3Ω  cen timeters.


It can easily be checked by you , o f course.


So you get a huge displacement in this d irection compared to h .


If you use small angle approxima tion--


and you be tter be lieve tha t two degrees is very small--


then you can prove , which is purely geometrica l ma thematics--


and I leave you w ith that proo f--


that  this  is approximate ly x squared divided by 2L .


I want you to prove that.


You take  the expansion o f the cosine , the theories of  the Taylor series , and you cu t it o ff

somewhere , and th is is no t so difficult  to prove.


In o ther words , v prime squared, wh ich is 2gh , can now be replaced by approxima tely 2g times x

squared d ivided by 2L which is g times x squared divided by L.


And so the velocity o f the bu lle t, v, which is (m plus M) divided by m--


I bring the m down there--


times v prime, bu t v prime is now the square root o f this , so I ge t an x here times the square roo t

of g over L.


And wha t you see now , but in a very clever way, by getting x in here, we can now do a qu ite

accurate measurement of  the speed of this bulle t, because we can measure x with a fair

accuracy--


maybe an uncertain ty o f only one or two millime ters in x out o f the 3Ω or four or five centimeters .


We're go ing to measure the speed o f such a bullet--


we did  that be fore--


to get a number which is no t too d ifferen t.


I think we got some thing like 200  to 250 me ters per second.


I will give you the input for this experiment.


The bulle t mass  is 2 plus or minus 0.2 grams.


I apolog ize tha t I don't give you all  the numbers in mks units .


You will have  to convert them, of course, to mks units .


The leng th of the pendulum is 1.13 me ters plus or minus two cen timeters--


we're no t cer tain--


with an accuracy o f about  two centime ters.


And the mass o f that block , wh ich is huge, I believe is 3 ,200 grams, 3.2 kilograms, with an

uncertain ty of abou t two grams.


So we have a  ten percent uncer tain ty  in the mass, we have a two percen t uncertain ty in  the

length, and we have a neglig ible uncer tain ty in the mass of the b lock--


that's neg ligib ly small.


So if  I want to know now wha t the velocity  is o f the speed o f the bullet, I can ca lcula te what (m

plus M) d ivided by m is and I can ca lcula te the square root of g over L , and with those numbers I

find 4.7 times ten to the th ird times x .


We have  to measure x.


Now if you look a t the uncer tain ties  in the whole th ing, we're going to measure x , which may no t 
be 3Ω  cen timeters , it may be four or five--

but the uncer tain ty  in our measuremen t will probably be one or two millime ters . 

Let's say  it's 0 .2 centime ters. 

So th is is no t our real number yet. 

So tha t would be an uncer tain ty o f abou t two ou t o f 50,  is four ou t of a hundred , is four percen t.


This  is four percent, roughly four percen t.


So I would say we get the final speed of the bulle t to an accuracy o f about 15% if we combine a ll

the uncerta inties.


So le t's give it a sho t, no pun implied .


And we'll... we can make you see the pendulum right  there very shor tly.


And it is very cleverly designed .


When the pendulum s tar ts to swing, it's go ing to move a sma ll objec t.


There you have it.


I think I can turn  this on again .


I think that's fine.


There is a very small wiper, which is this black wiper , and as the pendulum swings--


this  is five centime ters,  this  is ten centime ters--


the wiper will stay a t the larges t extension when the pendulum swings back .


Okay.


When we fire bullets , it's always a little risky.


I have here  the ... the bolt.


Pu t the bolt in.


The bulle t's  in my pocket--


there's one.


That's righ t.


I take the bu lle t.


And I cock the gun .


Everyth ing done righ t, yes? So you can look there and then see the swing o f this very massive 
block, and the bu lle t will get absorbed in tha t block. 

You ready for th is? Three , two , one 

[fires ], zero . 

I would say 5 .2 centime ters seems to be about righ t, so x observed is abou t 5.2 cen timeters, and 
we know the uncer tainty of the 15% a lready , so I have to calcula te now the 4 .7 times ten to the 
third . 

4.7 exponen t th ird, multiplied by ...


I go mks, of course , so that th is .052 , and tha t is 244 meters per second .


I remember  last  time we had some thing very similar.


So the speed o f the bu lle t is abou t 244 meters per second.


It's a little under the speed of sound , which is 340 me ters per second , and we came  to the same

conclusion last time.


All righ t.


We have kine tic energy  in the bu lle t before  the bullet hit the block, and you can calcula te how

much tha t is, because you know the speed now and you know the mass--


one-half mv squared.


You can also ca lcula te how much kine tic energy there is when th is bu lle t is absorbed in here .


That's very easy--


that's one-half  times the to tal mass, (m plus M), times v prime squared, wh ich you also know

now.


And so you will see then , perhaps to your surprise, that if you compare the two, that 99 .94% o f a ll

available kine tic energy be fore the collision was destroyed, and there fore was converted  to heat.


That happened , of course... the hea t was produced in that block.


Now I'm going to change to the concep t o f impulse .


It's not comple tely unrelated  to what we jus t d id.


An impulse is giving someone a kick, tha t's what an impulse is .


Our bu lle t gave an impu lse to th is block, it gave it a kick.


Impulse.


Impulse is a vector , and it is de fined as the in tegra l o f F dt during a certain amoun t o f time--


let's say from zero to delta t.


Now, F equals ma, which is also dp /dt--


we have seen th is now several  times--


the rate o f change of momentum--


and so I can substitu te tha t in here, and so I find then the in tegra l from zero to de lta t o f dp/d t dt,

and tha t makes me move to the doma in of momenta , so I have now simply the in tegra l over dp

from some initial momentum, pi,  to some final momentum, p f.


And so tha t is simply the fina l momen tum minus the initial momen tum.


So wha t an impu lse does, it changes the momentum.


There is a force that ac ts on something for a short amount of time--


could be a little longer , as you will see with rockets--


and tha t g ives it a change in momen tum.


If we have an objec t tha t we drop on the floor, so we have an objec t, mass m, and we drop it on

the floor and we le t it  fall over a d istance h , then it's go ing to h it the floor with a cer tain speed--


we know  it's down , the velocity , and tha t equals the square roo t o f 2gh .


If th is were a comple tely elastic collision , which depends, o f course , on the qua lity o f the objec t,

and it depends on the quality o f the floor--


maybe a super ball on marb le would be almos t comple tely elas tic , then the ball would bounce 
back with tha t same velocity. 

And if tha t were indeed a comp letely e lastic collision , then you can see tha t the impulse that the 
ball is g iven to--


that is given to the ball as the ball hits the floor--


the floor is giving an impu lse to the ba ll, and tha t impulse equa ls 2mv.


The ball changes  its momen tum.


It was first mv in this direction , and now  it's mv  in th is direction , so the change is 2mv.


So an impulse is g iven to the ball.


Now, if the co llision were comple tely  ine lastic , then the ball would jus t...


say, like a toma to , I throw a toma to on the  floor , it goes


[spla t].


No speed anymore when it h its the ground,  then , o f course, the impulse wou ld only be mv,

because then it doesn't come back up , so there is no ...  the change in momentum is then smaller .


We have here  two balls that look alike .


They have a mass o f 0.1 kilogram, so m equals 0.1 kilogram, and I w ill drop them from a height of

about 1Ω meters , and tha t gives them a speed when they hit the floor o f abou t 5Ω me ters per

second. 

And so the momentum change is 2mv, so the impulse equals 2mv , is about 1.1, and that wou ld

be kilograms-me ters per second .


And that means tha t if the co llision time is de lta  t seconds, tha t the average force ac ting upon  this

ball during the co llision with the floor equa ls the impulse divided by de lta t, because remember,

that was our definition o f impu lse.


So if we know the impu lse, we ge t a feeling for the average force.


And for the ball that I will drop on the floor, we have done fast pho tography .


I will show you some results o f the fas t pho tography with a differen t ball, bu t never theless, we d id

it w ith  the ball  that  I w ill drop on the  floor very shor tly--


which is th is one--


that impac t time is only two milliseconds.


It's hard to believe tha t in two milliseconds the en tire co llision occurs.


And so if you substitu te in here now two milliseconds, then you ge t for the average force 550

newtons .


Just imag ine,  this ball has a mass of 0 .1 kilogram, the weight is one new ton , and during the

impac t, it weighs 550 times more.


What an incredible weigh t increase ! And  the average acceleration  tha t it experiences during the

impac t is 550  times g .


Peop le p lay tenn is, and they have speeds o f hundreds of miles per hour--


speeds are way higher than we have here, ten times h igher--


and so the we igh t increase is even more.


Now, if the co llision were comple tely  ine lastic , so  that if it were a  tomato or an egg , and this one

wouldn' t come up , the average force wou ld s till be approxima tely the same , the reason being  tha t

the impulse will be ha lf.


Bu t if the impac t time were also half and the impulse were half, then , of course, the force ...


the average force will be the same--


very high , but for a shorter amoun t of time .


So I wan t to show...


oh, I firs t want to show you now the...  these two ba lls.


One is almos t complete elastic collision w ith  the floor.


Whether this  is a comple te elastic collision depends not only on th is ba ll--


whether  it is a super ball--


it also depends on the condition of the floor.


This  is no t a very good floor,  this  is no t marb le.


So when I drop this one, it doesn't come up to th is po int here .


So it's no t a comple tely elas tic co llision, bu t it bounces pretty much.


So it is somewhere in comp letely  inelas tic and comp letely elas tic .


It's not bad, righ t? It's no t bad .


Now this one.


Watch it.


[spla t]


Looks alike , but it ain' t.


This one is comple tely  ine lastic .


It goes to  the floor and it goes c lunk.


You see a small bounce, bu t tha t's it.


And so the impact  times are very shor t--


two milliseconds  in the case o f the one that bounces back, one millisecond in the case of  the one

that wen t clunk, and their average weight is abou t 550 times the ir norma l we igh t.


I'd like to show you fast pho tography on no t th is very same ball, but on ano ther one that we did .


Let me  take this ... this ou t.


And that is a ball that comes down with a speed of four meters per second .


And each frame is one millisecond, so you will see a ruler, and the ruler  ind icates ...


has marks in centimeters , and so you will see it go...


in four milliseconds  it w ill go one centimeter , so it has a speed of 2Ω meters per second.


It will h it the floor , and then we can coun t the number of milliseconds tha t it takes contact and

going back up again .


It's not go ing to be two milliseconds , it's a little longer, but, aga in, impressively short.


All righ t, we're going to make it rather dark  in order to get decent qua lity.


I'm going to turn  five of these o ff and I'm go ing to set  the TV at two, and now  I will star t this .


There we go.


Let's hope tha t tha t will go .


Okay, there comes the ball down.


These marks are in cen time ters.


So there's a ruler  in centime ters.


This  is one cen timeter.


I'll rewind a little, because we were a little too la te.


Okay, let's star t again .


So watch when it passes this mark--


one, two , three--


you see four milliseconds for abou t one centime ter .


So tha t's 2Ω me ters per second .


And now we'll coun t the number o f milliseconds at impact.


One, two, three,  four, five, six, and it's o ff.


Abou t s ix, maybe seven milliseconds.


And th is is no special ba ll.


These impact times are amazingly short.


Now I have something very special for you--


something really specia l, someth ing that has kept me awake--


a lo t o f th ings keep me awake in physics, and no t only  in physics...


[scattered laugh ter ]


but this ... bu t this  is very special.


This  is very spec ial.


I have here a baske tball.


[ball bouncing ]


Not comp lete ly e lastic , but no t bad.


A tenn is ba ll--


not comp letely e lastic , but no t bad .


Now I'm going to drop them together ver tically down , and then th is ba ll w ill bounce up somehow .


And so the ques tion that I have  for you is , do you think  if I drop it from this heigh t tha t this tennis

ball will sort o f come up at most to this heigh t, or do you th ink  it will be lower, or do you  think  it will

be higher? So use your  intuition . 

[chuckling ]:  In the worst case it can be ...


it can be wrong--


he is already pushing h is finger up--


so wha t do you think? Will the tennis ball reach abou t the same heigh t? Who is  in favor o f tha t?

Who is in favor o f higher?

Wow.


Who is in favor o f a lot higher? Okay.


Okay, I'll  try it.


Now, I canno t guaran tee you tha t this ball will go s traight up a fter the impact, because clearly

that's  impossib le.


That has zero chance, so it probab ly go up in some direction .


Bu t you will see  the effect  that  I had in mind.


So there we go .


[balls bounce]


And you see tha t, indeed , tha t tennis ball...


goes way higher.


I'll try  it once more to see whether I can ge t it  to go up a little b it more ver tically, but  tha t is very

difficult.


It goes way h igher , and this  is some thing tha t you shou ld be ab le to calcula te , and you can , and

you will.


Believe me , it's part o f assignment number six.


You haven' t seen it yet.


There we go.


[ball bounces]


Oh, boy,  tha t was be tter .


Well... oh! Do any one of you know approxima tely how much higher  it goes, if this ball has way

higher mass than this one? Of course, the mass ra tio comes  into it.


Any  idea? Tw ice as high? You' ll be surpr ised when you do assignmen t six .


Much higher .


Okay, in fac t, you could even see it here all righ t tha t it was quite a b it higher than  twice.


Great... a great experimen t, and it's some thing you can do yourself in your dormitory.


Now I wan t to discuss  in the remain ing time abou t rockets.


A rocke t experience an impulse from the engine , and that changes the momentum o f the rocket.


Bu t be fore we go in to the de tails o f the rocket, think about, again , this  idea o f throwing objects on

the floor.


And le t's turn to toma toes .


I want toma toes , because I want a comple te inelas tic collision , so tomatoes hit the floor , and it's

not tha t I...


I'm no t only going to throw one toma to on the  floor , but  I'm very angry today,  I'm going to throw a

lot of these toma toes on the floor--


n, as  in Nancy , tomatoes on  the floor.


If one toma to hits the floor, the change of momentum is mv , if m is the mass o f the tomato .


Bu t I'm go ing to throw n on the floor, so the change o f momen tum is n, as  in Nancy, times the

mass o f the  tomato times v.


And th is is the number o f k ilograms per second o f toma toes tha t I throw on the floor.


So th is is a change of momentum.


And so this equa ls de lta p divided by delta t, and that's an average  force.


So the  floor will exper ience a force in down direction .


Of course tha t was also the case here when the ball experienced a force up, which we calculated

here.


The floor experienced , o f course, the same force in down direc tion--


action equa ls minus reaction--


Newton's th ird law.


So the  force experiences...


the floor exper iences a force in down direction.


And I can write it down in a somewhat more c ivilized form: F equals dm/dt  times the velocity, if

the velocity o f the toma toes that hit the floor  is cons tan t.


And we're going  to apply th is to rocke ts, whereby the exhaust out o f rocke ts has , re lative to the

rocket, a constan t speed.


And th is is then the number o f kilograms per second that I throw on the floor .


This  is very rea l.


I can throw these toma toes on a bathroom scale , and if I threw four kilograms per second on a 
bathroom scale, and they hit  the bathroom scale with five me ters per second, you better believe it 
that you will see  that  the bathroom scale will reach an average force o f abou t 20 newtons--

four times five . 

If it weren't toma toes , but if they were super ba lls which would bounce up, then the momentum 
change would be doub le, and so the ba throom scale would indica te 40 newtons. 

So th is is a real thing, it's a real force tha t you can record. 

Now I'm going to be a little bit unpleasant to you . 

I'm going to throw ro tten tomatoes a t you. 

Here you are, and I have here a toma to , and this tomato has zero speed to star t with . 

Let me make you a little bigger, otherwise I won' t even ... 

I won't even hit you . 

So th is is you. 

And so I give this toma to a certain velocity , v of x. 

The toma to h its you, 

[spla t]. 

Maybe it stays there, it's possible . 

Maybe 

[squish ], it will drip down . 

Bu t in any case,  the velocity in  the x direc tion is gone . 

So it hits you with a velocity vx and then v of x equals zero. 

And it may make a mess. 

You will exper ience a force. 

If I keep throwing these toma toes a t you all the time... 

and this  is the force that you will exper ience--

and tha t force is, of course , in this direction . 

You've go t a ll these tomatoes , and you feel  tha t as a force. 

Bu t now look a t the symme try o f the prob lem. 

Here the ve locity goes from vx to zero . 

Bu t I, throwing the toma toes, have to increase the velocity from zero to vx. 

So for obvious reasons , I mus t then  feel a force in th is direction--

think of it as a recoil when you fire a bullet. 

So I experience exac tly the same force , bu t in th is direc tion , and tha t now  is the idea beh ind a 
rocket. 

A rocke t is spew ing out  tomatoes--

well, no t quite toma toes--

it's spew ing ou t ho t gas  in this direc tion , and then the rocket will experience a force in that 
direction . 

That is the bas ic concep t behind a rocket. 

And the h igher the speed o f the gas that it throws out--

the higher that velocity--

the more kilograms per second it spits out, the higher dm/d t, the higher will be the force on  the 
rocket, and th is force on the rocket is ca lled the thrust o f the rocket. 

So if we have a rocke t in space--

here's the rocke t--

and the rocket is spewing ou t gas with a ve locity , u, which is fixed rela tive to  the rocket--

it's a burn ing of chemical energy . 

Chemica ls are burned, it comes out with a cer tain speed, and the rocket will then experience a 
force, which we call the thrust, and that is given by this equation. 

If you know how many kilograms per second are spewed ou t, and you know wha t the velocity is , 
which I've called u here, this w ill te ll you what the thrus t is o f tha t rocket. 

If we take the case o f the Saturn rocke ts that were used for  the landing on the Moon ... 

Sa turn. 

For the Saturn rockets , the speed u was abou t 2Ω  kilometers per second . 

So the gas came out with 2Ω kilometers per second re lative to the rocke t, and the rate a t which 
this gas was coming ou t is phenomenal--

15 tons o f ma teria l per second . 

dm/dt is abou t 15,000 kilograms per second--

it's a lmost unimaginable . 

And that would g ive it then a  thrust o f about 35 million newtons , which, o f course , was h igher than 
the weigh t of the rocke t, o therwise the rocke t would never go up. 

An incredib le thrus t.


I have a lso a nice problem  for you in assignmen t six with the Sa turn rockets.


You'll see these numbers again .


These are rounded off.


So rockets obta in an impulse from the ir engines , a force acts upon  the rocket for a cer tain amoun t

of time--


we call that  the burn time--


but as they burn the fuel, the mass o f the rocket goes down, because the fuel leaves.


And therefore  the accelera tion during the burn goes up, because the mass goes down.


And th is makes  it somewha t complicated to derive the velocity change that you ge t dur ing the

burn, during this  impulse.


It's done in your book--


Ohanian.


I find that deriva tion a little bit complicated .


I looked in other books, and I found one in the book by Tipler on physics, and his deriva tion--


and I w ill go through tha t in general  terms ...


I pu t that on the Web for you.


It should be  there ton igh t, so you may want  to take very few no tes.


The entire der ivation, o f which I will jus t h ighligh t the importan t issues, is on the Web .


And the way that T ipler  is doing it is exclusive ly from your frame of re ference .


You're sitting in 26 .100, and you are see ing th is rocket go up .


Let's keep tha t equation , wh ich is the thrus t o f the rocket, excep t tha t in the case of a rocke t we

would ca ll th is u , wh ich is the speed of the exhaust rela tive to the rocke t, and this  is wha t we ca ll

the thrus t.


So le t's now take a rocket, which at  time t as seen from your frame o f reference--


where you are sitting .


I use v--


it's your frame o f re ference .


It's going up with a ve locity v.


The mass of the rocke t is m.


And now we're going  to look at time  t p lus de lta  t.


The rocke t has increased its speed , v plus delta v.


The mass  is m--


let me do  that in ... no t in color.


The mass  is now m minus delta m, and here is a little bit o f exhaust  that was spewed ou t w ith

velocity u re lative to the rocket--


u rela tive to  the rocke t.


So you in 26.100 w ill see the velocity of this little piece delta m--


you will see  this to be v minus u.


If the velocity of  the rocket is larger than u--


could be--


you will see  the exhaust go ing up from your frame o f re ference .


If the velocity of  the exhaust is  larger than the velocity of the rocket, from you frame o f reference ,

you will see it go down.


That's taken care o f in the signs.


Now I'm going to compare the momentum here with the momentum there, and we take the

situa tion that there are no ex ternal forces acting upon it--


somewhere in ou ter space, this rocke t burns.


Momen tum must be conserved .


The momen tum at time  t equals m times v.


That is very simple .


That is time t.


The momen tum at time  t p lus de lta  t o f the en tire system including the exhaus t--


if I'm telling you tha t momen tum is conserved , you can' t ignore  the exhaust.


It's momen tum of the system that is conserved.


The momen tum of the rocke t is going to change and  the momentum of  the exhaust is going to

change, bu t not o f the system.


So we're going to get mass times velocity--


(m minus delta m) times (v plus delta v) plus delta m, which has a velocity v minus u .


And how  large is th is? Well, there is mv plus m de lta v.


Here you see the m delta v , here you see the mv, and then you ge t minus u delta m, and the 
delta mv here cancels minus delta mv here , and this term, delta m de lta v, is the product of  two 
incredibly sma ll numbers--

I ignore tha t. 

So th is is the momen tum a t t plus delta t and th is is the momen tum a t time t, and so  the change in

momen tum, delta p--


which must be zero because momentum is conserved--


is m de lta v minus u delta m.


m delta v minus u de lta m.


I can take the deriva tive of  this equa tion , so I ge t on the le ft side dp /dt.


dp/d t is going to be zero, so I get zero equa ls m times dv/dt, but dv /dt is the acceleration o f the

rocket minus u dm/d t.


And that is the thrust on the rocke t.


So wha t you see here is some thing  tha t is very easy to digest--


that ma , wh ich is the...  this  is the accelera tion o f the rocket, th is is the mass o f the rocket a t time

t--


equals the thrust of the rocke t, and tha t equals u dm/dt.


And some people call  this the ... the "rocket equation." Now, this  is true if there is no externa l force

on the system.


It is  interesting to include a real launch from Ear th, and  if you have a real launch from Ear th, then 
the rocket is going up in th is direc tion , bu t then gravity is exactly  in the opposite d irection. 

In o ther words , on ly when you launch ver tically from Earth would you have a  thrust like this, and 
you would have mg like th is.


In tha t case , th is equation has to be adjusted, and  then you get ma equals m  thrust minus mg .


Only  if you have a launch from Ear th vertically up .


Now you have to do a little b it o f massaging, and I will leave you with tha t massag ing.


A couple of in tegra ls are necessary to convert this  into  the final velocity o f the rocket a fter the

burn compared to the initia l velocity .


And that par t I w ill leave you with, bu t you will see tha t worked ou t in all de tail on the notes that I

left on  the Web .


And then you come up with a very famous equa tion tha t the final velocity o f the rocket minus the

initial velocity o f the rocket equals minus u times the logarithm of the fina l mass of the rocke t

divided by the initia l mass of the rocke t.


This  is if there were no gravity a t a ll.


Just in case , and only in case o f a vertical launch from Earth, there is also here a term, minus g t--


only if you have a vertical launch from Earth .


When I watched my  lecture, I no ticed that in my en thusiasm I put bracke ts around the minus gt.


This  is qu ite mislead ing , because it may give you the w rong impression  that  there's a product at

stake here, which is not so.


So the bracke ts rea lly should not be around the minus gt.


It is this term, minus u logarithm of mf divided by m of i minus gt.


Let's now  look a t th is equation in a little bit more de tail, so tha t we get a little bit o f feeling for  it.


Suppose we had a vertica l launch from Ear th , but we had no rocket.


It's possible .


So th is term does no t ex ist.


What do you see? Tha t the velocity equals v initial--


we have called tha t before in 801 v zero--


that's the initial speed--


minus gt.


Ha! We had tha t result dur ing our first lec ture--


comple tely consistent with th is equation.


If you have no rocke t, you ge t tha t v equa ls v zero minus gt, if you throw the objec t ver tically up

and we had a vertica l launch .


So tha t looks good .


We launch from the Earth , and we now have an initial speed which is zero .


The rocke t is standing there , and we fire the rocke t.


t, by the way, is the burn time of the rocke t.


Let me write tha t down .


t is the burn time .


So initial speed is zero.


So now , this final velocity...


if we want this fina l velocity to be any thing physica lly meaning ful--


a positive number--


this thing has to come ou t positive. 

And you will say, "But how can tha t be?" Because we have a minus sign here and we have a 
minus sign there. 

How can that ever become positive? Well, don't  forget  that the  final mass is sma ller always than 
the initial mass, because you burn fue l, and so this  logarithm is always go ing to be nega tive , and 
so th is term is always going  to be positive, if you burn any fuel. 

Now, of course for th is veloc ity to be a real value--

physically mean ing ful--

this term has to kill th is one , has to be larger than this one, otherwise the rocket won' t even go up. 

You could be spewing out fuel all the time, and the rocket would jus t be sitting there , because the 
thrust up effec tively  is not enough to lift it o ff. 

So the  first term has to win from the second term in case of a vertical launch . 

Let's take a examp le with some numbers--

it always gives a little bit o f insigh t. 

We have a burn time o f abou t 100 seconds, and the initial speed is zero , and let us take a case

whereby u is 1,000 me ters per second .


That is  less than the Sa turn rocket, but it's still a s izable ...


it's a kilome ter per second.


So the exhaust is coming ou t rela tive to the rocke t w ith one kilome ter per second.


And the fina l mass d ivided by the in itial mass of  the rocket is 0 .1, so 90% was burned away, the

fuel that is gone .


You have only ten percent le ft when  the burn is over .


So now we can calcu late--


if this was a launch from Ear th , a vertical launch up--


we can calcula te how  large this term is , take the logarithm of this value, multiply this by minus u,

and then we find tha t the final velocity...


The first  term is 2,300, and the second term, 100 seconds, and this  is ten , is minus 1000 .


So you pay a price for the gravita tional field .


And so you have about 1 .3 kilometers per second is the final speed o f tha t rocke t.


These are me ters per second , and tha t is in kilometers per second .


Now, if there were no grav ity , then o f course the gain in speed--


this difference--


would be 2,300 me ters per second .


Also , if there is no vertica l launch bu t if,  for  instance , the rocket were in orbit around the Earth--


here we have the rocke t and going in orbit around the Earth--


then , o f course, even though there is gravity, gravity is now no t doing any work.


And therefore if you fire th is rocket  for 100 seconds, the change in veloc ity , the tangen tial change,

will also be 2,300 me ters per second .


You canno t say now there is gravity and there fore we have to take the g t term into accoun t.


It will be  the same  for this equa tion .


If you had an objec t going in th is d irection, th is minus g t term wou ldn' t be there either.


It's only , o f course, when you deal with a ver tical motion.


It is very  important  to rea lize , and very non-in tuitive , tha t when you burn a certa in amount o f fuel

for a given amount of  time you ob tain a fixed change in the velocity .


This  is fixed for a given amoun t o f fue l.


The change in kine tic energy  is no t fixed , and I'll g ive you some numbers so that you can

immedia tely check tha t for yourself.


And it is very non-intuitive.


It is, in  fact, a mistake tha t is made by many physicis ts who think tha t if you burn the same

amoun t of fuel of  the same rocket for the same amoun t of time tha t the increase in kine tic energy

is a given .


That is no t true.


It's the change in ve locity that is a g iven.


Bu t suppose tha t v final minus v  in itial is 100 me ters per second.


That's  jus t a given .


I have a rocket, I have a cer tain amoun t of fuel,  I burn it, and tha t is my change in ve locity .


I s tart off with v  initia l zero , so my kinetic energy  increase is one-half m times 100 squared , which

is ten to the  fourth .


That's wha t I got ou t of th is burn.


Now I use the very same rocke t, the same amoun t o f fuel, the same burn time , so  I ge t again tha t

the final velocity minus the initial velocity  is still 100 .


That's exactly the same .


Bu t be fore the burn, this rocke t had an initial velocity o f 1,000 me ters per second .


What is now the ga in o f kine tic energy? The final velocity is now 1,100. 

That's non-negotiable , because the rocke t changes the momentum changes the velocity by a 
fixed amoun t. 

So now the ga in of kine tic energy, the increase of kine tic energy equals one-ha lf m times 1 ,100 
squared minus 1 ,000 squared .


This  is the new ve locity and  this was the old one .


And th is number is one-ha lf m  times 200,000.


This cou ld be in joules , and this  is also in joules .


This number is 20 times higher.


So you see  tha t the change in velocity was exac tly the same.


The rocke t burned the same amoun t o f time , the same amoun t of fuel, but the kinetic energy

increase is way more if the rocket has a h igher speed to star t w ith .


We here in 26 .100 made our own rocket.


It's a very down- to-earth mode l, no pun implied.


Bu t it is quite powerfu l, and I wou ld like to show  it  to you, because we are qu ite proud o f it.


As a rocket, we use a fire ex tinguisher--


carbon dioxide--


and this fan tas tic invention I have here .


And th is powerfu l rocke t is enough to reach the escape velocity o f...


[loud whooshing ]


...of 26 .100 .


[students  laughing ]


I a lmos t reached the escape veloc ity , bu t I crashed.


See you next Friday.
