8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 6 

Last time we d iscussed that an acceleration is caused by a push or by a pull. 

Today we will express this more qualitatively in three laws which are ca lled Newton's

Laws.


The first  law really goes back to the first part of the 17th century.


It was Ga lileo who expressed what he called the law of inertia and I will read you his

law. 

"A body at rest rema ins at rest "and a body in motion continues to move "at constant 
velocity along a stra ight  line unless acted upon by an externa l force." And now I w ill 
read to you Newton's own words in his famous book, Principia. "Every body 
perseveres in its state of rest "or of uniform motion in a  right line "unless it is 
compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it." Now, Newton's First 
Law is clearly aga inst our daily experiences. 

Things that move don't move along a straight line and don't continue to move, and 
the reason is, there's gravity.


And there is another reason.


Even if you remove gravity then there is friction, there's a ir drag.


And so things will always come to a halt.


But we believe, though, that in the absence of any forces indeed an object, if it had a

certain velocity would continue a long a straight line forever and ever and ever.


Now, this law, this very fundamental law does not hold in a ll reference frames.


For instance, it doesn't hold in a  reference frame which itself is being accelerated.


Imagine that I accelerate myself right here.


Either I jump on my horse, or I take my bicycle or my motorcycle or my car and you

see me being accelerated in this d irection.


And you sit there and you say, "Aha, his velocity is changing.


"Therefore, accord ing to  the F irst Law, there must be a force on him." And you say,

"Hey, there, do you feel that force?" And I said, "Yeah, I do! "I rea lly feel that, I feel 
someone's pushing me." Consistent with the first law. 

Perfect,  the F irst Law works for you.


Now I'm here.


I'm being accelerated in this d irection and you a ll come towards me being

accelerated in this d irection.


I say, "Aha,  the F irst Law should work so  these people should feel a push."  I say,

"Hey, there! Do you  feel the push?" And you say, "I feel nothing.


There  is no push, there is no pull." Therefore, the F irst Law doesn't work from my

frame of reference if I'm being accelerated towards you.


So now comes the question, when does the First Law work? Well, the First Law works

when the frame of reference is what we ca ll an " inertia l" frame of reference.


And an inertial frame of reference would then be a frame in which there are no

accelerations of any kind.


Is that possible? Is 26.100...


is this lecture hall an inertial reference frame? For one, the earth rotates about its

own axis and 26.100 goes with it.


That g ives you a centripetal acceleration.


Number two, the earth goes around the sun.


That g ives it a centripeta l acceleration including the earth, including you, includ ing

26.100.


The sun goes around the Milky Way, and you can go on and on.


So clearly 26.100  is not an inertial reference frame.


We can try to make an estimate on how large these accelerations are that we

experience here in 26.100 and let's start w ith the one that is due to the earth's 
rotation. 

So here's the earth...


rotating w ith angular velocity omega and here is the equator, and the earth has a

certain radius.


The rad ius of the earth...


this is the symbol for earth.


Now, I know that 26.100 is here but let's just take the worst case that you're on the 
equator. 

You're... 

[no audio]


You go around like this and in order to do that you need a centripeta l acceleration, a

c which, as we have seen last time, equa ls omega squared R.


How large is that one? Well,  the period of rotation for the earth is 24 hours times

3,600 seconds so omega equals two p i d ivided by 24 times 3,600 and that would

then be in rad ians per second.


And so you can ca lculate now what omega squared R earth is if you know that the

radius of the earth is about 6,400 kilometers.


Make sure you convert this to meters, of course.


And you w ill find, then that the centripetal acceleration at the equator which is the

worst case--


it's less here--


is 0.034 meters per second squared.


And this is way, way less--


this is 300 times sma ller than the gravitationa l acceleration that you experience here

on Earth.


And if we take the motion of the earth around the sun then it is an additional factor

of five times lower.


In other words, these accelerations even though they're real and they can be

measured easily w ith today's high-tech  instrumentation--


they are much, much lower than what we are used to which is the gravitationa l

acceleration.


And therefore, in spite of these accelerations we will accept this hall as a reasonab ly

good inertia l frame of reference in which the First Law then should hold.


Can Newton's Law be proven? The answer is no, because it's impossible to be sure

that your reference frame is w ithout any accelerations.


Do we believe in this? Yes, we do.


We believe in it since it is consistent within the uncerta inty of the measurements

with all experiments that have been done.


Now we come to the Second Law, Newton's Second Law.


I have a spring...


Forget gravity for now--


you can do this somewhere in outer space.


This is the relaxed length of the spring and I extend the spring.


I extend it over a certain amount, a certain distance--


unimportant how much.


And I know that I when I do that that there will be a pull--


non-negotiab le.


I put a mass, m1, here, and I measure the acceleration that this pull causes on this

mass immediately after I release it.


I can measure that.


So I measure an acceleration, a1.


Now I replace this ob ject by mass m2 but the extension is the same, so the pull

must be same.


The spring doesn't know what the mass  is at the other end, right? So the pull is the

same.


I put m2 there, d ifferent mass and I measure the new acceleration, a2.


It is now an experimenta l fact that m1 a1 equals m2 a2.


And this product, ma, we call the force.


That  is our definition of force.


So the same pull on a ten times larger mass would g ive a ten times lower

acceleration.


The Second Law I will read to you: "A force action on a body gives it an acceleration

which is in the direction of the force..." That's a lso important--


the acceleration is in the d irection of the force.


"And has a magnitude g iven by ma." ma is the magnitude and the direction is the

direction of the force.


And so now we w ill write this in a ll glorious detail.


This is the Second Law by Newton perhaps the most important law in all of physics

but certa inly in a ll of 801: F equals ma.


The units of this force are kilograms times meters per second squared.


In honor of the great man, we call that "one newton." &nbsp;


Like the First Law, the Second Law only holds in inertial reference frames.


Can the Second Law be proven? No.


Do we believe in it? Yes.


Why do we believe in it? Because a ll experiments and a ll measurements w ithin the

uncerta inty of the measurements are in agreement w ith the Second Law.


Now you may ob ject and you may say "This is strange, what you've been doing.


"How can you ever determine a mass "if there is no  force somewhere? "Because  if

you want to determine the mass "maybe you put it on a scale, "and when you put it 
on a sca le to determine the mass "you made use of gravitational force "so isn't that 
some kind of a circular argument that you're using?" And your answer is "No." I can 
be somewhere in outer space where there is no gravity. 

I have two p ieces of cheese; they are identical in size.


This is cheese without holes, by the way.


They are identical in size.


The sum of the two has doub le the mass of one.


Mass is determined by how many molecules--


how many atoms I have.


I don't need gravity to have a relative sca le of masses so I can determine the

relative sca le of these masses without ever using the force.


So this is a very leg itimate way of checking up on the Second Law.


Since a ll ob jects in this lecture ha ll and the earth fall w ith the constant acceleration,

which is g we can write down that the gravitational force would be m times this

acceleration, g.


Normally I write an "a" for it, but I make an exception now because gravity, I call it

"gravitational force." And so you see that the gravitational force due to  the earth on

a particular mass is linearly proportional with the mass.


If the mass becomes ten times larger then the force due to gravity goes up by a

factor of ten.


Suppose I have here this softball in my hands.


In the reference frame...


26.100 we will accept to be an inertia l reference frame.


It's not being accelerated in our reference frame.


That means the force on it must be zero.


So here is that ba ll.


And we know if it has mass, m--


which in this case is about ha lf a kilogram--


that there must be a force here, mg which is about five newtons, or half a kilogram.


But the net force is zero.


Therefore it  is very clear that I, Wa lter Lew in, must push up w ith a force from my

hand onto the ball, which is about the same...


which is exactly the same, five newtons.


Only now is there no acceleration so I can write down that force of Walter Lewin plus

the force of gravity equa ls zero.


Because it's a one-dimensional problem you could say that the force of Walter Lewin

equa ls minus mg.


F equals ma.


Notice that there is no statement made on velocity or speed.


As long as you know  f and as long as you know m a is uniquely specified.


No information is needed on the speed.


So that would mean, if we take gravity and an object was falling down with five

meters per second that the law would hold.


If it would  fall down with 5,000 meters per second it would a lso hold.


Will  it always hold? No.


Once your speed approaches the speed of light then Newtonian mechanics no longer

works.


Then you have to use Einstein's theory of specia l relativity.


So this is only valid as long as we have speeds that are substantia lly smaller, say,

than the speed of light.


Now we come to Newton's Third Law: "If one ob ject exerts a force on another "the 
other exerts the same force in opposite direction on the one." I'll read it again. 

"If one ob ject exerts a force on another "the other exerts the same force in opposite 
direction on the one." And I norma lly summarize that as follows, the Third Law as 
"Action equals minus reaction." &nbsp; 

And the minus sign indicates, then, that  it opposes so you sit on your seats and you 
are pulled down on your seats because of gravity and the seats will push back on 
you with the same force. 

Action equa ls minus reaction. 

I held the baseba ll in my hand. 

The baseball pushes on my hand with a certain force. 

I push on the baseba ll with the same force. 

I push aga inst the wa ll with a certain force. 

The wall pushes back in the opposite direction w ith exactly the same force. 

The Third Law a lways holds. 

Whether the objects are moving or accelerated makes no difference. 

All moments in time, the force--

we ca ll it actually the "contact force" between two ob jects--

one on the other is always the same as the other on one but in the opposite

direction.


Let us work out a very simple example.


We have an ob ject which has a mass, m1.


We have ob ject number one and m1 is five kilograms.


And here, attached to it, is an ob ject two and m2 equa ls 15 kilograms.


There  is a force and the force is coming in from  this direction.


This is the force--


and the magnitude of the force is 20 newtons.


What is the acceleration of this system? F equa ls ma.


Clearly the mass is the sum of the two--


this force acts on both--


so we get m1 plus m2 times a.


This is 20, this is 20 so a equals one meters per second squared in the same

direction as f.


So the whole system is being accelerated with one meters per second squared.


Now watch me closely.


Now I single out this ob ject--


here it is...


object number two.


Object number one, while this acceleration takes p lace must be pushing on ob ject

number two.


Otherw ise object number two could never be accelerated.


I call that force f12 the force that one exerts on two.


I know that number two has an acceleration of one.


That's a given already.


So here comes f equals ma.


f12 equa ls m2 times a.


We know a is one, we know m2 is 15 so we see that the magnitude of the force 12 is

15 newtons.


This force is 15.


Now I'm going to isolate number one out.


Here is number one.


Number one experiences this force, f, which was the 20 and it must experience a

contact force from number two.


Somehow, number two must be pushing on number one if one is pushing on number

two.


And I ca ll that force "f21." &nbsp;


I know that number one is being accelerated and I know the magnitude is one meter

per second squared.


That's non-negotiab le, and so we have that f, this one, plus f21 must be m1 times a.


This is one, this is five, this  is 20 and so  this one, you can a lready see, is minus 15.


F21 is in this d irection and the magnitude is exactly the same as f12.


So you see? One is pushing on two w ith 15 newtons in this direction.


Two is pushing back on one with 15 newtons and the whole system is being

accelerated w ith one meter per second squared.


Now, in these two examples--


the one whereby I had the baseba ll on my hand--


you saw that it was consistent w ith the Third Law.


In this examp le, you a lso see that it's consistent with the Third Law.


The contact force from one on the other is the same as from the other on one but in

opposite signs.


Is this a proof? No.


Can the Third Law be proven? No.


Do we believe in it? Yes.


Why do we believe in it? Because a ll measurements, a ll experiments within the

uncerta inties are consistent w ith the Third Law.


Action equa ls minus reaction.


It is something that you experience every day.


I remember I had a garden hose on the lawn and I would open the faucet and the

garden hose would start to snake backwards.


Why? Water squirts out.


The garden hose pushes onto the water in this d irection.


The water pushes back onto the garden hose and it snakes back.


Action equa ls minus reaction.


You take a ba lloon.


You take a ba lloon and you blow up the ba lloon and you let the air out.


The ba lloon pushes onto the air.


The air must push onto the ba lloon.


And therefore, when you let it go the ba lloon will go in this direction which is the

basic idea behind the rocket.


[huffing and puffing]


I love to p lay w ith balloons, don't you? So, if I do it like this, and I let it go the a ir 
will come out in this direction and so then it means the balloon is pushing on the air 
in this direction. 

the a ir must be pushing on the balloon in this direction. 

There  it goes. 

[whistles] 

It didn't make it to the moon but you saw the idea of a  rocket. 

Action equa ls minus reaction. 

If you fire a gun, the gun exerts a force on the bullet the bullet exerts an equa l force

on the gun which is called the recoil.


You  feel that  in your hands and your shoulder.


I have here a marvelous device which is a beautiful example of "action equa ls minus

reaction." I show you  from above what it looks like.


You'll see more deta ils later.


This rotates about this axis rather freely--


the axis is vertica l--


and we have here a  reservoir of water, which we will heat up.


It turns into steam and these are hollow tubes and the steam w ill squirt out.


And so when the steam squirts out in this d irection the tube exerts a force on the

steam  in this d irection so the steam exerts an equal force in the opposite d irection

and so the thing w ill start to rotate like this.


And I would like to demonstrate that.


You can see it now there.


With a little b it of luck, there you see it.


So we're going to heat it.


[torch hissing]


Walking.


When you wa lk, you push aga inst the floor.


The floor pushes back at you and if the floor wouldn't push back at you you couldn't

even wa lk, you couldn't go forwards.


If you walk on ice, very slippery--

you can't go anywhere, because you can't push on the ice so the ice won't push back 
on you. 

That's another example where you see action equals minus reaction. 

This engine is called "Hero 's engine." 

Hero, accord ing to the Greek legend was a priestess of Aphrodite. 

Let's first look at it. 

She was a priestess of Aphrodite and her lover, Leander would sw im across the

Hellespont every night to be with her.


And then one night the poor guy drowned and Hero threw herself into the sea.


Very romantic thing to do but, of course, also not a very smart thing to do.


On the other hand, it must have been a smart lady if she invented, really, this

eng ine.


Yesterday, I looked at the Web, "ask.com."  It's wonderful--


you can ask any question.


You can say, "How old am I?" Now, you may not get the right answer but you can

ask any question.


And I typed  in, "Hero's engine." And out popped a very nice high- tech version of

Hero's engine.


A soda can--


you pop four holes in the soda can at the bottom.


So here's your soda can.


You pop four holes in here, but when you put a nail in there you bend every time the

nail to the same side so the holes are slanted.


You put it in water you lift it out of water and you have a Hero 's engine.


And I made it for you--


it took me only five minutes.


I went to one of MIT's machines, got myself a soda put the holes in it, and here it is.


It's in the water there.


When I lift  it out, you will see the water squirts.


There  it goes.


High-tech version of Hero 's engine.


Also makes a bit of a mess, but okay.


All right.


Try to make one--


it's fun and it's very quick.


It doesn't take much time at all.


There are some b izarre consequences of these laws.


Imagine that an ob ject is falling towards the earth.


An apple is falling towards the earth from a height, say, of, hmm, I'd say 100

meters.


And let's ca lculate how long it takes for this apple to hit the earth which should for

you be trivia l, of course.


So here's the earth...


and the mass of the earth is about 6 times 10 to the 24 kilograms.


And here at a distance, h--


for which we will take 100 meters--


is this app le, m, which, say, has a mass of half a kilogram.


There's a force from the earth onto the apple and this is that force.


And the magnitude of that force is mg and that is 5 newton.


I make g ten and just round it off a little.


Now, how long does it take this object to hit the earth? So, we know that 1/2 gt

squared equa ls h.


It doesn't start with any initial speed, so that is 100.


G is 10, this is 5, so t squared  is 20.


So t is about 4Î©  seconds.


So after 4Î©  seconds, it hits the earth--


so far, so good.


But now, according to the Third Law the earth must experience exactly the same 
force as the apple does but  in opposite direction. 

So therefore the earth w ill experience this same force, f--

5 newton, in this d irection. 

What is the earth going to do? Well, the earth is going to fa ll towards the apple--

f equa ls ma. 

So the force on the earth  is the mass of the earth times the acceleration of the earth. 

The force, we know, is 5.


We know the mass, 6 times 10 to the 24 so the acceleration will be 5 divided by 6

times 10 to the 24 which is about 8 times 10 to  the minus 25 meters per second

squared.


How long w ill the earth fall? Well, the earth w ill fall roughly 4Î©  seconds before they

collide.


How far does the earth move in the 4Î©  seconds? Well, it moves one-half a earth t

squared.


That's the d istance that it moves.


We know a and we know t squared, which is 20.


One-ha lf times 20 is 10 so that means this distance becomes that number times 10.


It's about 8 times 10 to the minus 24 meters.


The earth moves 8 times 10 to the minus 24 meters.


That, of course, is  impossib le to measure.


But just imag ine what a wonderful concept this is! When this ball falls back to me the

earth and you and I and MIT are falling towards the ba ll.


Every time that the ball comes down we're fa lling towards the ball.


Imagine the power I have over you and over the earth! &nbsp;


But you may want to think about this--


if I throw the ball up, going to be away from the earth I'll bet you anything that the

earth w ill a lso go away from the ball.


So as I do this, casua lly playing--


believe me, man, what a glorious feeling it  is--


earth is going down, earth is coming towards the ba ll. 

The earth is going down and I'm part of the earth and  I'm shaking this earth up and 
down by simp ly playing with this ball. 

That  is the consequence of Newton's Third Law even though the amount by which 
the earth moves is, of course, too small to be measured. 

I now want to work out with you a rather deta iled example of something in which we

combine what we have learned today--


a down-to-earth problem--


the kind of a problem that you might see on an exam or on an assignment.


We hang an ob ject on two strings and one string makes an ang le of 60 degrees with

the vertical and the other makes an ang le of 45 degrees with the vertical.


So this is the one that makes an angle...


oh, 60 degrees with the horizon, 30 degrees w ith the vertica l and this one, 45

degrees.


Let's assume that the strings have neglig ible mass.


So they are attached here to the ceiling and I hang here an object, m.


Well, if there's an ob ject m for sure there w ill be a force mg, gravitationa l force.


This object is hanging there, it's not being accelerated so  the net acceleration must

be zero.


And so one string must be pulling in this d irection and the other string must be

pulling in this direction so that the net force on the system is zero.


Let's call this pull, for now, "T1." We'll ca ll that the tension in the string and we ca ll

the tension in this string "T2." &nbsp;


And the question now is how large is T1 and how large is T2? There are various ways

you can do this.


One way that always works--


pretty safe--


you call this the x d irection.


You may choose which d irection you call "p lus."  I call this plus, I ca ll this negative.


And you could call this the y d irection and you may call this plus and this negative.


I know, from Newton's Second Law--


F equals ma--


that there is no acceleration, so this must be zero so the sum of all forces on that

mass must be zero.


These three forces must eat each other up, so to speak.


Well, if that's the case, then the sum of a ll forces in the x d irection must also be zero

because there's no acceleration in the x d irection and the sum of a ll forces in the y

direction must be zero.


And so I am going  to decompose them--


something we have done before.


I am going to decompose the forces into an x and into a y direction.


So here comes the x component of T1 and its magnitude is T1 times the cosine of 60

degrees.


Now I want to know what this one is.


This one is T1 times the sine of 60 degrees.


This projection, T2, cosign 45 degrees and the y component, T2 times the sine of 45

degrees.


So we go into the x direction.


In the x direction I have T1 cosign 60 degrees minus T2 cosign 45 degrees equa ls

zero--


that's one equation.


The cosine of 60 degrees  is one-half and the cosine of 45 degrees is one-ha lf square

root two.


Now I go to the y d irection.


This is plus, this is minus, so we get one component here which is T1 times the sine

of 60 degrees plus T2 times the sine of 45 degrees minus mg.


It's in the opposite direction--


must be zero.


That's my second equation.


The sine of 60 degrees equa ls one-half the square root three and the sine of 45

degrees is the same as the cosine one-half square root two.


Notice I have two equations with two unknowns.


If you tell me what m is I should be ab le to solve for T1 and for T2.


In fact,  if we add them up it's going to be very easy because we lose this because we

have both one-half square root two.


And so you see immed iately here that one-half times T1 plus one-half square root

three times T1 equa ls mg and so you find that the tension 1 equa ls two mg d ivided

by one p lus the square root of three.


I can go back now to this equation--


T1 times one-ha lf equals T2 times one-half square root of two.


I lose my ha lf and so T2 equals T1 d ivided by the square root of two.


So the bottom line is, you tell me what m is I'll tell you what T1 is and I'll tell you

what T2 is.


Suppose we take a mass of four kilograms--


m equa ls four kilograms, so mg is about 40 if we make g ten  for simplicity.


Then T1, if you put in the numbers, is about 29.3 and T2...


29.3 newtons and T2 is about 20.7 newtons, I believe.


It's very difficult to rig this up as an experiment but I've tried that.


I'll show you in a minute.


I want you to know that there is another method which is perhaps even more

elegant and which you may consider in which there is no decomposition in the two

directions.


Here is mg--


that's a g iven.


And we know that the other d irections are a lso given--


this angle of 30 degrees here and this angle of 45 degrees.


If these two  forces must cancel out this one why don't I flip this one over? Here it

comes.


I flip it over.


There  it is.


T1 and T2 now,  together, must add up to this one.


Then the prob lem is solved, then the net force is zero.


Well, that's easy--


I do this.


And now I have constructed a complete fair construction of T1 and of T2.


No physics anymore now, it's a ll over.


You know this angle here, 45 degrees, so this is 45 degrees.


This is 30, this is 30.


You know all the ang les and you know this magnitude is mg so it's a high school

problem.


You have a  triangle with all the angles and one side;


you can ca lculate the other sides and you should find exactly the same answer, of

course.


We made an attempt to rig it up.


How do we measure tension? Well, we put in these lines, scales, tension meters and

that is problematic, believe me.


We put in here a tension meter, we put in here a tension meter and the bottom one,

we hang on a string w ith a tension meter and then here we put four kilograms.


These sca les are not masses.


That's already prob lematic.


The scales are not very accurate so we may not even come close to these numbers.


For sure,  if I put four kilograms here then I would like this one to read 40 newtons or

somewhere in that neighborhood depending on how accurate my meters are.


These are springs, and the springs extend and when the springs extend, you see a

handle...


a hand go.


You can clearly see how that works because if there is a force on that bottom sca le in

this direction, which is mg, and it's not being accelerated then the string must pull 
upwards and so... 

in order to make the net force zero.


And if you have a pull down here and you have a pull up here and you have in here a

spring then you see you have a way of measuring that force.


We often do that--


we measure w ith springs the tension in strings.


For whatever it's worth, I will show you what we rigged up.


Now a measurement without knowledge of uncerta inties is meaning less--


I told you that.


So maybe this is meaningless, what I am going  to do now.


Let me do something meaningless for once.


And remember, when I show it, you can a lways close your eyes so that you haven't

seen it.


So we have here something that approaches this 60 degrees and this approaches the

45 degrees and we're going to hang four kilograms at the bottom.


There  it is, and here it is.


All right, this one--


it's not too far from 40.


It's not an embarrassment.


This one is not too  far from 20.7.


This one is a b it on the low side.


Maybe I can push it up a little.


I think that's close to 30;

it's not bad.


So you see, it's very d ifficult to get these ang les right but it's not too far off.


So let's remove this again because this will block your view.


These sca les were calibrated in newtons, as you could see.


Now we come to something very delicate.


Now I need your alertness and I need your help.


I have a b lock--


you see it there--


and that block weighs two kilograms.


A red b lock.


So here it is.


It's red.


And I have two strings.


It's hang ing from a b lack string here and a black string there.


Ignore that red string, that is just a safety.


But it's a very thin thread here and here.


And they are as close as we can make them the same.


They come from the same batch.


This one has a mass of two kilograms and this string has no mass.


This is two kilograms.


So what will be the tension in the upper string which is string number one? This is

string number two.


Well, this string must be able to carry this two kilograms so the tension has to be 20

newtons.


So you w ill find here the tension--


call it T1--


which is about 20 newtons.


So it's pulling up on this ob ject.


It's also pulling down from the ceiling, by the way.


Think about it, it's pulling from the ceiling.


The tension is here, 20 newtons.


We could put in here one of these sca les and you would see approximately 20

newtons.


What is the tension here? Well, the tension here is very close to zero.


There's nothing hanging on it and the string has no weight so there's no tension

there--


you can see that.


Now I am going to pull on here and  I'm going to increase the tension on the bottom

one until one of the two breaks.


So this tension goes up and up and therefore, since this ob ject is not being 
accelerated--

we're going to get a force down now on this object--

this tension must increase, right? You see that? If I have a force on this one... 

so there's a  force here, and there is mg then, of course,  this string must now be mg 
plus this force. 
So the tension w ill go up here and the tension will go up here. 

The strings are as  identica l as they can be. 

Which of the strings will break first? What do you think? &nbsp; 

LEWIN: Excuse me? 

[student answers  unintellig ibly] 

I can't hear you. 

STUDENT: The one on top. 

LEWIN: The one on top. 

Who is in favor of the one on top? Who says no, the bottom one? 

[Student answers  unintellig ibly] 

LEWIN: Who says they won't break at a ll? Okay, let's take a  look at it. 

The one on top--

that's the most likely, right? Three, two, one, zero. 

The bottom one broke. 

My goodness. 

Newton's Second Law is at stake. 

Newton's Third Law is at stake. 

The whole world is at stake! Something is not working. 

I increased tension here, this one didn't break. 

This one's stronger, perhaps. 

No, I don't cheat on you; 
I'm not a magician. 

I want to teach you physics.


Did we overlook something? You know, I'll give you a second chance.


We'll do it aga in.


Let's have another vote.


So I'll give you a chance to change your minds.


It's nothing wrong in life, chang ing your mind.


It's one of the greatest things that you can do.


What do you think w ill happen now? Who  is in favor still of the top one? Seeing is

believing.


You still insist on the top one? Who is now in favor of the bottom one? Ah, many of

you got converted, right? Okay, there we go.


Three, two, one, zero.


The top one broke.


So some of you were right.


Now I'm getting so confused.


I can't believe  it anymore.


First we argued that the top one should break but it didn't--


the bottom one broke.


Then we had another vote and then the top one broke.


Is someone pulling our leg? I suggest we do it one more time.


I suggest we do it one more time and whatever's going to happen, that's the winner.


If the top one breaks, that's the w inner.


If the bottom one breaks, well, then, we have to accept that.


But I want you to vote again.


I want you to vote again on this decisive measurement whether the top one w ill

break first or the bottom one? Who is  in favor of the top one? &nbsp;


Many of you are scared, right? You're not voting anymore!


[class  laughs]


LEWIN:  I can tell, you're not voting.


Who is in favor of the bottom one? Only ten people are voting.


[class  laughs]


LEWIN: Let's do this in an undemocratic way.


You may decide--


what's your name? Alicia? Georg ia, close enough.


[laughter]


You may decide whether the top one or the bottom one will break.


Isn't that great?  Doesn't it give you a fantastic amount of power? &nbsp;

The bottom one.


The bottom one.


You ready? Three, two, one, zero.


The bottom one broke.


You were right.


You will pass this course.


Thank you, and see you Wednesday.


By the way, think about this, think about this.
