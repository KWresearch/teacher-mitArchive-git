8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript – Lecture 1 

I'm Wa lter Lewin.


I will be your lecturer th is term.


In physics, we exp lore the very small to the very large.


The very sma ll is a small frac tion o f a pro ton and the very large is the universe itself.


They span 45 orders of magn itude--


a 1 with 45 zeroes .


To express measurements quan tita tively we have to in troduce un its .


And we in troduce for the unit o f leng th, the me ter;


for the unit of time , the second ;


and for the unit of mass, the kilogram.


Now, you can read in your book how these are de fined and how the definition evolved h istorically.


Now, there are many derived units wh ich we use in our daily  life for convenience and some are

tailored toward specific fie lds.


We have cen timeters, we have millimeters kilome ters.


We have inches, feet, miles.


Astronomers even use the astronomical unit which is the mean distance between the Earth and

the sun and they use ligh t-years wh ich is the distance that ligh t travels  in one year .


We have milliseconds , we have microseconds we have days, weeks, hours , centuries, months--


all derived units.


For the mass , we have milligrams, we have pounds we have me tric tons .


So lo ts o f derived units exis t.


Not all of  them are very easy to work with.


I find it ex tremely difficu lt to work with inches and fee t.


It's an extremely uncivilized sys tem.


I don't mean to insu lt you, bu t th ink about it--


12 inches in a foot, three feet in a yard.


Could drive you nu ts. 

I work almost exclusive ly decima l, and I hope you will do the same during this course bu t we may 
make some excep tions . 

I will now firs t show you a mov ie, which is called  The Powers of Ten.  It covers 40 orders of 
magnitude.


It was origina lly conceived by a Du tchman named Kees Boeke in the early  '50s.


This  is the second-genera tion movie , and you w ill hear  the voice of Pro fessor Morrison, who is a

professor a t MIT. 

The Power of Ten--40 Orders o f Magnitude . Here we go. 

I a lready  introduced , as you see there leng th , time and mass and we call these the three

fundamen tal quantities  in physics.


I will give th is the symbol capital L for length cap ita l T for time , and capital M for mass.


All o ther quan tities  in physics can be derived from these fundamen tal quan tities .


I'll give you an examp le.


I pu t a bracket around here .


I say [speed] and that means the dimensions of speed .


The dimensions of speed is the d imension of length d ivided by the dimension o f time .


So I can write  for tha t: [L] divided by [T].


Whether it's me ters per second or  inches per year that's not wha t ma tters.


It has the dimens ion leng th per time .


Volume wou ld have the dimension o f leng th to the power three.


Density would have the dimension o f mass per un it volume so tha t means length  to the power

three .


All-impor tan t in our course is accelera tion .


We will deal a lo t w ith accelera tion .


Accelera tion , as you will see , is length per time squared.


The unit is meters per second squared .


So you get length divided by time squared.


So all o ther quan tities can be derived from  these three  fundamen tal.


So now tha t we have agreed on the un its--


we have the me ter, the second and the kilogram--


we can star t making measuremen ts.


Now, all-impor tan t in making measuremen ts which is a lways ignored in every college book is the

uncertain ty  in your measuremen t.


Any measurement that you make withou t any knowledge of  the uncertain ty is meaning less.


I will repea t this .


I want you to hear  it tonight a t 3 :00 when you wake up.


Any measurement that you make withou t the know ledge of its uncerta inty  is complete ly

meaningless.


My grandmother used to tell me tha t...


at least she believed it...


that someone who is  lying in bed is  longer than someone who stands up.


And in honor o f my grandmother I'm go ing to bring  this today to a tes t.


I have here a setup where I can measure a person standing up and a person lying down.


It's not  the greatest bed , but lying down.


I have to convince you about  the uncerta inty  in my measuremen t because a measuremen t

withou t knowledge of the uncer tainty  is mean ingless .


And therefore , wha t I w ill do is the follow ing.


I have here an aluminum bar and  I make the reasonable, p lausib le assump tion  that when this

aluminum bar is sleep ing--


when it is horizontal--


that it is no t longer than when it is standing up .


If you accept that, we can compare the leng th o f th is aluminum bar with this setup and w ith this

setup.


At least we have some kind of calibration to star t with.


I will measure it.


You have to  trust me .


During these three mon ths , we have to trust each other .


So I measure here, 149 .9 centimeters .


However, I would think that the...


so th is is the a luminum bar.


This  is in vertical position . 

149.9 .


Bu t I would th ink tha t the uncer tain ty o f my measurement is probably 1 millimeter.


I can' t really guaran tee you tha t I did it accura tely any better .


So tha t's the vertical one .


Now we're going to measure the bar horizon tally for wh ich we have a se tup here .


Oop! The scale is on your side.


So now I measure the length o f this bar.


150.0 horizon tally.


150.0 , again , plus or minus 0 .1 cen time ter.


So you would agree with me  that  I am capable o f measuring p lus or minus 1 millime ter.


That's the uncertainty of my measuremen t.


Now, if the difference in lengths be tween lying down and standing up if tha t were one foo t we

would all know  it, wouldn't we? You get ou t o f bed in the morning you lie down and you ge t up

and you go , clunk! And you're one foo t shorter .


And we know tha t tha t's not the case .


If the d ifference were only one millime ter we would never know.


Therefore, I suspect  tha t if my grandmo ther was right then it's probably only a few cen timeters ,

maybe an inch .


And so I would argue  that if I can measure  the leng th of a s tuden t to one millimeter accuracy tha t 
should se ttle the issue . 

So I need a volun teer . 

You wan t to volun teer? You look  like you're very ta ll. 

I hope tha t... yeah, I hope tha t we don' t run out o f, uh ... 

You're no t taller than 178 or so? What is your name? STUDENT: Rick Ryder. 

LEW IN : Rick--

Rick Ryder. 

You're no t nervous, righ t? R ICK: No ! LEWIN : Man! 

[class laughs] 

Sit down . 

[class laughs] 

I can't have  tall guys here. 

Come on . 

We need someone more modest in size . 

Don't take it personal, R ick. 

Okay, what is your name? STUDENT: Zach. 

LEW IN : Zach. 

Nice day today, Zach , yeah? You feel all right? Your first lec ture at MIT? I don' t. 

Okay, man . 

Stand there , yeah. 

Okay, 183.2. 

Stay there, stay there . 

Don't move . 

Zach... 

This  is vertical. 

What did  I say? 180? Only one person. 

183? Come on . 

.2--

Okay, 183.2. 

Yeah . 

And an uncertain ty o f abou t one... 

Oh, th is is cen timeters--

0.1 centime ters.


And now we're going  to measure him horizon tally.


Zach, I don' t wan t you to break your bones so we have a little s tep for you here .


Pu t your feet there.


Oh, le t me remove the aluminum bar .


Watch ou t for the scale .


That you don' t break tha t, because then it's all over . 

Okay, I'll come on your side . 

I have to do tha t--

yeah, yeah. 

Relax. 

Think of this as a small sacrifice for the sake o f science , right? Okay , you good? 

ZACH : Yeah. 

LEW IN : You comfor table? 

[students  laugh] 

You're rea lly comfortable , right? ZACH : Wonderful. 

LEW IN : Okay. 

You ready? ZACH : Yes . 

LEW IN : Okay. 

Okay. 

185.7 .


Stay where you are .


185.7 .


I'm sure... I want to first make the sub traction, righ t? 185.7, plus or minus 0.1 cen timeter.


Oh, that is five ...


that is 2.5 p lus or minus 0.2 cen time ters.


You're abou t one inch ta ller when you sleep than when you stand up.


My grandmother was righ t.


She's always r ight.


Can you ge t o ff here? I want you to appreciate tha t the accuracy...


Thank you very much , Zach .


That  the accuracy of one millimeter was more than sufficient to make the case.


If the accuracy of my measuremen ts would have been much less this measurement wou ld not

have been convincing at all.


So whenever you make a measurement you must know the uncer tainty .


Otherw ise, it is meaningless.


Galileo Galilei asked himse lf the question: Why are mammals as  large as they are and no t much

larger? He had a very clever reason ing which I've never seen in print.


Bu t it comes down  to the fact tha t he argued that if the mammal becomes too massive that  the 
bones will break and he thought that that was a limiting fac tor. 

Even though I've never seen his reasoning in prin t I will try to reconstruc t it wha t could have gone 
through his head .


Here is a mammal.


And th is is one o f the four legs o f the mamma l.


And th is mammal has a size S.


And wha t I mean by that is a mouse is yay big and a ca t is yay b ig.


That's wha t I mean by size--


very crudely defined.


The mass of the mammal is M and th is mammal has a thigh bone which we call the femur, which

is here .


And the femur o f course carries the body, to a large ex tent.


And le t's assume tha t the femur has a leng th l and has a th ickness d .


Here is a femur.


This  is wha t a femur approximately  looks like.


So th is will be the length o f the femur ...


and this will be the thickness , d and  this w ill be the cross-sectional area A.


&nbsp ;


I'm now going to take you through wha t we call in physics a scaling argument.


I would argue that the leng th o f the femur mus t be proportiona l to the size of  the animal.


That's comple tely plausib le.


If an animal is four times larger than ano ther you would need four times  longer  legs .


And that's all this is saying .


It's very reasonable .


It is also very reasonab le tha t the mass o f an animal is proportional to the third power o f the size

because tha t's rela ted to its vo lume.


And so if it's rela ted to the th ird power o f the size it mus t a lso be proportional to  the third power o f

the leng th of the femur because of this re lationship .


Okay, tha t's one.


Now comes the argumen t.


Pressure on the femur  is proportional  to the weight o f the an ima l d ivided by the cross-section A o f

the femur .


That's wha t pressure is .


And that is the mass o f the anima l tha t's proportional to the mass o f the an ima l d ivided by d

squared because we wan t the area here , it's propor tional to d squared.


Now follow me c losely.


If the pressure is higher than a cer tain leve l the bones will break.


Therefore, for an anima l not to break  its bones when the mass goes up by a certain fac tor  let's

say a factor o f four  in order for the bones not to break d squared must also go up by a fac tor of

four.


That's a key argumen t in the scaling here.


You really have to think that through carefu lly.


Therefore, I wou ld argue tha t the mass must be propor tional to d squared .


This  is the breaking argumen t.


Now compare these two.


The mass  is proportional to  the leng th of  the femur to the power three and to the thickness of  the

femur to the power  two.


Therefore, the thickness of the femur to the power two must be propor tional to the leng th l and

there fore the thickness o f the femur must be propor tional to l to the power three-halfs.


A very  in teresting result.


What is this result telling you? It tells you that if I have two anima ls and one is ten times  larger

than the o ther then S is ten times larger tha t the leng ths of the legs are  ten times  larger bu t tha t

the thickness of  the femur  is 30 times  larger because it  is l to the power three halves .


If I were to compare a mouse with an elephan t an elephant is abou t a hundred times  larger  in size

so the length o f the  femur o f the elephan t would be a hundred times  larger than tha t o f a mouse

but the  thickness o f the  femur would have to be 1,000 times  larger.


And that may have convinced Galileo Galilei that that's  the reason why the larges t animals are as

large as they are .


Because clearly , if you increase the mass there comes a time  tha t the th ickness o f the bones  is

the same as the length o f the bones.


You're all made o f bones and tha t is biologica lly not feasible.


And so there is a limit somewhere set by th is scaling law.


Well, I wanted to bring this to a test.


After all I brought my grandmo ther's sta temen t to a test so why no t br ing Galileo Ga lile i's

statemen t to a tes t? And so I wen t to Harvard where they have a beau tiful co llection of femurs

and I asked  them for the femur o f a raccoon and a horse.


A raccoon is this b ig a horse is abou t four times bigger so the length o f the  femur o f a horse must

be about four times the leng th o f the raccoon.


Close.


So I was not surprised .


Then I measured the  thickness, and I said  to myself, "Aha!" If  the leng th is four times higher then

the thickness has to be eigh t times higher if th is ho lds.


And wha t I'm go ing to plot for you you w ill see tha t shor tly  is d divided by  l, versus  l and tha t, o f

course, must be proportional to l to  the power one-ha lf.


I bring one l here.


So , if I compare the horse and I compare the raccoon I would argue tha t the thickness divided by

the leng th of the femur for the horse must be the square roo t o f four , twice as much as tha t of the

raccoon.


And so I was very anxious to plot that, and I did that and I' ll show you  the resu lt.


Here is my first resu lt.


So we see there , d over  l.


I exp lained to you why I pre fer tha t.


And here you see the leng th .


You see here the raccoon and you see the horse .


And if you look carefully , then the d over  l for the horse is only abou t one and a half times  larger

than the raccoon .


Well, I wasn't too d isappointed .


One and a ha lf is not  two, bu t it is  in the right direc tion .


The horse clearly has a larger value for d over  l than  the raccoon .


I rea lized I needed more da ta , so I wen t back to Harvard.


I said, "Look,  I need a smaller an ima l, an opossum maybe maybe a ra t, maybe a mouse," and

they sa id, "okay." They gave me three more bones.


They gave me an antelope which is actually a little larger than a raccoon and they gave me an 
opossum and they gave me a mouse . 

Here is the bone o f the an telope. 

Here is the one o f the raccoon . 

Here is the one o f the opossum. 

And now you won't be lieve th is. 

This  is so wonder ful, so roman tic. 

There is the mouse. 

[students  laugh] 

Isn't that beau tiful? Teeny, weeny little mouse? Tha t's only a teeny, weeny  little femur. 

And there it is. 

And I made the p lot. 

I was very curious wha t tha t plo t would look  like . 

And ... 

here it is. 

Whew! I was shocked. 

I was really shocked . 

Because look--

the horse is 50 times larger in size than the mouse . 

The difference in d over  l is only a fac tor o f two . 

And I expec ted some thing more like a fac tor of seven . 

And so, in d over l, where I expec t a factor of seven I only see a factor o f two . 

So I said to myself, "Oh, my goodness. Why didn't I ask them for an elephan t?" The real clincher 
would be the elephan t because if that goes way off scale maybe we can still rescue the sta temen t 
by Galileo Ga lile i and so I wen t back and they said "Okay, we' ll give you the femur o f an 
elephan t.” 

They a lso gave me one of a moose, be lieve it or no t. 

I think they wan ted  to get rid of me by tha t time to be frank with you. 

And here is the femur o f an e lephan t. 

And I measured it. 

The leng th and the  thickness.


And it is very heavy.


It weighs a ton.


I p lotted it, I was fu ll of expec tation.


I cou ldn't sleep a ll nigh t.


And there's the elephant.


There is no evidence whatsoever that d over  l is really larger for the elephant  than for the mouse .


These ver tical bars  indica te my uncer tain ty in measuremen ts o f thickness and the horizontal

scale, which is a logarithmic scale ...


the uncerta inty o f the leng th measurements  is  in the  thickness of the red pen so there's no need

for me to indicate tha t any further.


And here you have your measuremen ts in case you want to check them.


And look again a t the mouse and look at  the elephant.


The mouse has  indeed only one centime ter  leng th of  the femur and the elephant is, indeed ,

hundred times  longer.


So the  first scaling argumen t tha t S is propor tiona l to l that is cer tainly wha t you would expect

because an elephan t is about a hundred times larger  in size.


Bu t when you go  to d over  l, you see it's all over .


The d over  l for the mouse is really no t a ll tha t differen t  from the elephant and you would have

expected that number to be with the square roo t o f 100 so you expec t it to be ten times  larger

instead o f about  the same .


I now want to discuss with you wha t we ca ll in physics dimens ional ana lysis.


I want to ask myself the ques tion : If I drop an apple from a certain height and I change tha t heigh t

what will happen with the time  for the apple to fa ll? Well, I drop the apple from a heigh t h and  I

want to know wha t happened w ith the time when it falls .


And I change h .


So I said to myself, "Well, the  time tha t it takes must be propor tiona l to the he ight  to some power

alpha ." Comple tely reasonable .


If I make the height larger we all know that it takes  longer for the apple to fall.


That's a sa fe thing .


I said to myself, "We ll, if the app le has a mass m "it probably is also propor tional to the mass of

that apple to the power beta." I said to myself, "Gee , yeah, if something is more massive it will

probably take less time ." So maybe m to some power beta.


I don't know alpha, I don' t know beta .


And then I said , "Gee, there's a lso some thing like gravity tha t is the Earth's gravitational pull--

the gravitational accelera tion o f the Earth ." So le t's introduce that, too and let's assume  that  that 
time is also proportional to the gravita tional accelera tion--

this  is an accelera tion; we will learn a lo t more about that--

to the power gamma. 

Having sa id this , we can now do wha t's called in physics a d imensional analysis. 

&nbsp ; 

On the le ft we have a time and if we have a le ft...

on the left side a time on the righ t side we mus t a lso have time .


You canno t have coconuts on one side and oranges on the o ther .


You canno t have seconds on one side and me ters per second on the o ther .


So the dimensions  left and righ t have to be the same.


What is the dimens ion here? Tha t is [T] to the power one.


That T... that must be the same as length to the power alpha times mass to the power be ta, times

acceleration--


remember, it is still there on the blackboard--


that's dimension [L ] d ivided by time squared and  the whole thing to the power gamma so I have a

gamma here and I have a gamma there.


This side mus t have the same dimension as tha t side.


That is nonnegotiable in physics.


Okay, there we go .


There is no M here, there is on ly one M here so be ta must be zero .


There is here  [L] to the power alpha, [L] to  the power gamma there is no [L ] here.


So [L ] mus t d isappear .


So alpha plus gamma mus t be zero .


There is [T] to the power one here and there is here [T] to the power -2 gamma .


It's minus because it's downstairs.


So one must be equal to -2 gamma.


That means gamma must be minus one half.


That if gamma is minus one half, then a lpha equa ls p lus one half.


End of my d imensiona l analysis. 

I there fore conclude that the time that it takes for an object to fall equals some cons tan t, which I 
do no t know but that constant has no dimension--

I don't know wha t it is--

times the square root o f h div ided by g . 

Be ta is zero , there is no mass h to the power one ha lf--

you see tha t here--

and g to the power minus one half. 

This  is propor tional to the square root of h because g is a g iven and c is a given even though I

don't know c .


I make no pretense tha t I can predict how  long it will  take for the apple to fall.


All I'm saying is,  I can compare two different he igh ts.


I can drop an app le from e igh t me ters and another one  from two me ters and the one from eight

meters will take two  times longer than the one from two me ters.


The square root of h to  two,  four over two will take two times  longer , righ t? If  I drop one from e ight

meters and  I drop another one  from  two me ters then  the difference in time will be the square root

of the ratio.


It will be  twice as long.


And that I wan t to bring  to a test today.


We have a setup here.


We have an app le there a t a he igh t o f three meters and we know the leng th to an accuracy...  the

heigh t o f abou t three millime ters, no be tter.


And here we have a se tup whereby the apple is abou t one and a ha lf meters above the ground.


And we know tha t to abou t also an accuracy o f no be tter than abou t three millime ters.


So , let's se t it up .


I have here ...


something that's going to be a prediction--


a predic tion o f the time  tha t it takes for one app le to fall divided by the time tha t it  takes for the

other apple  to fall.


H one is three meters bu t I c laim there is an uncerta inty of about three millimeters.


Can't do any better.


And h 2 equals 1.5 meters aga in with an uncer tain ty of about three millime ters.


So the ra tio h one over h two...


is 2.000 and now I have to come up w ith an uncer tain ty which physicists sometimes call an error

in their measurements bu t it's really an uncerta inty .


And the way you find your uncer tain ty  is tha t you add  the three here and you sub tract  the three

here and you ge t the larges t va lue possible .


You can never get a larger value .


And you'll  find that you get 2 .006 .


And so I would say the uncer tain ty is then .006.


This  is a dimensionless number because it's  leng th divided by  leng th .


And so the time  t1 divided by t2 wou ld be the square root o f h1 divided by h2 .


That is the d imensional analysis argument that we have there.


And we find if we take the square roo t of  this number we find 1.414, plus or minus 0 .0 and I  think

that is a two .


That is correct.


So here is a firm pred iction.


This  is a predic tion .


And now we're going  to make an observa tion .


So we're going to measure t1 and there's going to be a number and  then we're going to measure

t2 and there's going to be a number.


I have done this experimen t ten times and the numbers always reproduce within abou t one

millisecond .


So I could jus t adopt an uncer tain ty of one millisecond.


I want to be a little bit on the sa fe side .


Occasionally  it d iffers by two milliseconds .


So le t us be conservative and let's assume  that  I can measure this to an accuracy o f about  two

milliseconds.


That is pretty sa fe .


So now we can measure these times and then we can take the ra tio and  then we can see

whether we actually confirm that the time tha t it  takes is propor tiona l to the he ight  to the square

root of the heigh t.


So I will make it a little more comfor table for you in the lecture hall.


That's all righ t.


We have  the setup here .


We first do the experiment with the ... three me ters.


There you see the three meters.


And the time... the moment that I pu ll this string the app le will fall, the con tac t w ill open , the clock

will s tart.


The momen t tha t it hits the floor,  the time will s top .


I have to s tand on that side .


Otherw ise the apple will fa ll on my hand .


That's no t the idea .


I'll stand here .


#VALUE!

You ready? Okay , then I'm ready.


Everyth ing se t? Make sure that I've zeroed  that properly.


Yes,  I have .


Okay.


Three,  two, one , zero.


&nbsp ;


781 milliseconds .


So th is number ...

you should write it down because you will need it for your second assignmen t.


781 milliseconds , with an uncer tain ty o f two milliseconds.


You ready for the second one? You ready? You ready? Okay, no thing wrong.


Ready.


Zero, zero, righ t? Thank you .


Okay.


Three,  two, one , zero.


&nbsp ;


551 milliseconds .


Boy,  I'm nervous because I hope  tha t physics works.


So I take my calcu lator and I'm now go ing to take  the ratio t1 over t2 .


The uncerta inty you can find by adding the two here and subtracting the two  there and that will

then give you an uncerta inty of, I think, .0... mmm, .08 .


Yeah , .08 .


You should do  that  for yourse lf--


.008 .


Dimensionless number.


This would be the uncer tain ty.


This  is the observation.


781 d ivided by 551.


One poin t...


Let me do that once more.


Seven eigh t one , d ivided by five five one...


One four one seven .


Perfect agreemen t.


Look, the pred iction says 1.414 but it cou ld be 1 po int...

it could be two higher.


That's the uncertainty  in my height.


I don't know any better.


And here I could even be o ff by an e igh t because tha t's the uncer tain ty  in my timing.


So these  two measurements confirm.


They are in agreement with each other .


You see, uncer tain ties  in measuremen ts are essential.


Now look a t our results.


We have here a result wh ich is strik ing.


We have demons trated tha t the time tha t it takes for an objec t to fa ll is independent o f its mass .


That is an amazing accomp lishmen t.


Our grea t-grand fa thers mus t have worried abou t this and argued about  this for more than 300

years.


Were they so dumb to overlook this simple dimensional analysis? Inconceivable.


Is this dimensiona l analysis perhaps not qu ite kosher? Maybe .


Is this dimensiona l analysis perhaps one that could have been done d ifferen tly? Yeah, oh , yeah.


You could have done it very differently.


You could have said the following .


You could have said , "The time for an app le to fa ll is proportional to the heigh t tha t it falls from to

a power alpha." Very reasonable .


We a ll know, the h igher  it is , the more it will take--


the more  time it will take.


And we could have said , "Yeah , it's probab ly proportional to the mass somehow . If the mass is

more , it will take a little bit less time." Turns ou t to be not so , but you could think tha t.


Bu t you could have said "We ll, le t's not take the acceleration o f the Earth bu t let's take  the mass

of the Earth itself." Very reasonable , right? I wou ld think if I increased the mass o f the Earth that

the apple will fall faster.


So now I will pu t in the ma th o f the Ear th here.


And I star t my dimensional analysis and I end up dead in the wa ters .


Because , you see , there is no mass here .


There is a mass to the power be ta here and one to the power gamma so what you would have

found is beta p lus gamma equa ls zero and that would be end o f s tory.


Now you can ask yourself the ques tion well, is there something wrong with the analysis tha t we 
did? Is ours perhaps be tter than this one? Well, it's a different one . 

We came to the conclusion that the time that it takes for the app le to fall is  independen t o f the 
mass.


Do we believe tha t? Yes , we do.


On the other hand,  there are very prestigious physicists who even nowadays do very fancy

experiments and they try to demonstra te tha t the time for an apple  to fall does depend on its 
mass even  though it probably  is only very small, if it's true bu t they try to prove that. 

And if any o f them succeeds or any one of you succeeds tha t's cer tain ly wor th a Nobel Prize. 

So we do believe that it's independent o f the mass. 

However, th is, wha t I d id with you , was no t a proof because if you do it this way, you ge t s tuck. 

On the other hand,  I'm quite pleased w ith the fac t tha t we found that the time is proportional with 
the square root o f h . 

I think that's very use ful. 

We con firmed that with experiment and indeed it came out tha t way.


So it was no t a comple te waste o f time.


Bu t when you do a dimensional analysis , you be tter be careful.


I'd like you to think this over, the comparison be tween the two a t dinner and maybe at break fast

and maybe even while you are tak ing a shower whether it's needed or no t.


It is  importan t that you diges t and apprecia te the difference be tween these two approaches.


It will g ive you an insight in the power and also into the  limita tions o f d imensional analysis.


This goes to the very heart o f our understand ing and appreciation of physics.


It's  important that you ge t a feel for th is.


You're now at MIT.


This  is the time .


Thank you.


See you Friday .
