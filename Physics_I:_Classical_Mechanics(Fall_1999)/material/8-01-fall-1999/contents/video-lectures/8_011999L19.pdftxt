8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 19 

We have here , going back to ro tating objec ts... 

I have an ob ject here that has a cer tain velocity v , and it's go ing around with angular velocity

omega , and a little la ter the angle has  increased by an amoun t the ta and then the veloc ity  is here.


We may now do some thing we haven' t done be fore .


We cou ld g ive this objec t in this circle an accelera tion .


So we don't have to keep the speed constant.


Now, v equals omega R , so  tha t equals the ta do t times R.


And I can take now the firs t der ivative o f this .


Then I ge t a tangen tia l acceleration, which wou ld be omega do t times R, which is the ta doub le

dot times R, and we call theta double do t...


we call this a lpha , and alpha is the angular accelera tion which is  in radians per second squared.


Do no t con fuse ever the  tangen tia l acceleration, which is along the circumference , w ith a

centripe tal accelera tion .


The two are both there , o f course.


This  is the one tha t makes the speed change along the circumference .


If we compare our know ledge o f the past o f linear motion and we wan t to transfer  it now  to

circular motion,  then you can use all your equations from the pas t if you conver t x to the ta, v to 
omega and a to a lpha . 

And the we ll-known equations tha t I'm sure you remember can then a ll be used.


For ins tance , the equation x equa ls x zero p lus v zero t plus one-half a t squared simply becomes

for circular motion theta equals the ta zero p lus omega zero t plus one-ha lf alpha t squared--


it's tha t simple.


Omega zero is then the angu lar velocity at  time t equals zero, and theta zero is the angle a t time t

equals zero rela tive to some reference poin t.


And the velocity was v zero plus at.


That now becomes tha t the velocity goes to angular ve locity omega equals omega zero p lus

alpha t.


So there's really no t much added in terms o f remember ing equations.


If I have a rota ting d isk, I can ask myself the question now which we have never done be fore, 
what kind of kine tic energy , how much kine tic energy is there in a rotating disk? We only dealt 
with linear mo tions , w ith one-half mv squared, bu t we never considered ro tating objec ts and the 
energy that  they conta in. 

So le t's work on tha t a little . 

I have here a disk, and the center o f the disk  is C , and this disk  is ro ta ting with angular velocity

omega  that could change in time , and the disk has a mass m, and the disk has a radius R .


And I wan t to know at this momen t how much kine tic energy o f ro tation is s tored in that disk.


I take a little mass element here , m of i, and this radius equals r o f i and  the kine tic energy o f tha t

element i alone equals one-half m o f i  times v of i squared, and v o f i is this velocity--


this angle is 90 degrees .


This  is v of i.


Now, v equals omega R .


That always holds for these rotating objects .


And so I prefer to write th is as one-ha lf m o f i omega squared r of i squared .


The nice thing abou t writing it this way  is tha t omega, the angular ve locity, is the same for all

points of  the disk, whereas the ve locity  is not because  the velocity of a point very close to the 
center  is very  low. 

The ve locity here is very high, and so by go ing to omega, we don't have that problem anymore . 

So , what is now the kine tic energy of rotation o f the d isk, the entire d isk? So we have to make a 
summation, and so that is omega squared over two times the sum of m o f i r  i squared over a ll 
these elemen ts mi which each have their individual radii, r o f i. 

And th is, now , is wha t we ca ll the moment o f inertia,  I.


Don't confuse  tha t with impulse ; it has no thing to do with impulse .


And th is is moment o f inertia...


So the momen t o f inertia is the sum o f mi ri squared .


In...


So th is can also be written as one-half I, I put a C there--


you will see shor tly why , because the momen t o f iner tia depends upon which axis o f ro ta tion I

choose--


times omega squared.


And when you see tha t equa tion you say, "Hey, that looks quite similar to one-half mv squared ."

And so I add to this list now .


If you go from linear motions to rota tional mo tions, you should change the mass in your  linear 
motion to  the momen t of iner tia in your rota tional mo tion, and then you ge t back to your one-half 
mv squared. 

You can see tha t. 

So we now have a way of calcu lating the kine tic energy of ro tation provided that we know how to 
calculate  the momen t of inertia . 

Well, the moment o f inertia is a boring job . 

It's no physics, it's pure math , and I'm not going to do that for you. 

It's some in tegra l, and if the objec t is n icely symmetric , in general you can do  that. 

In this case, for the disk wh ich is ro tating abou t an axis  through the center and the ax is--

that's  impor tan t--

is perpendicular to  the disk--

that's essen tial--

in that case the momen t o f iner tia equa ls one-half m times R squared. 

And I don' t even want you to remember this . 

There are tables in books , and you look these th ings up. 

I don't remember tha t. 

I may remember  it for one day, bu t then, obvious ly, you forget that very qu ickly again . 

Needless to say, tha t the momen t o f iner tia depends on wha t kind o f objec t you have . 

Whether you have a disk or whe ther you have a sphere or whether you have a rod makes all the

difference .


And wha t a lso makes the difference--


about which axis you ro ta te the ob ject.


If we had a sphere, a solid sphere , then...


So here you have a solid sphere, and I ro tate it abou t an axis through its center .


Then the momen t o f inertia,  I happen to remember , equals two-fifths mR squared if R  is the

radius and m is the mass of  the sphere.


My research is  in astrophysics .


I deal with s tars, and stars have ro ta tional kinetic energy.


We'll get back to  that in a minu te--


not in a minute bu t today--


and this  is the one moment o f inertia tha t I do remember. 

If you have a rod , and you let  this rod ro tate about an axis through the cen ter, and this ax is is 
perpendicular to the rod--

the latter  is  importan t, perpendicu lar to the rod--

and it is length l and it has mass m, then  the momen t of iner tia--

which I looked up this morning ; I would never remember tha t--

equals 1/12 ml squared . 

And all  these momen ts of iner tia you can find in  tables  in your book on page 309 . 

So the momen t o f inertia for rota tion about  this axis o f a solid disk  is one-half mR squared . 

Bu t it's complete ly differen t, the momen t o f iner tia , if you rotated it abou t this axis. 

So you take the p lane of  the disk. 

Instead o f rota ting it this way , you ro tate it now this way . 

You ge t a  tota lly differen t momen t of iner tia . 

And most of those you can find in tables, bu t not all o f them. 

Tables only go so far, and  that is why I wan t to discuss with you two theorems wh ich w ill help you

to find momen ts o f inertia in mos t cases .


Suppose we have a rota ting disk , and I will make you see the disk now with dep th .


So th is is a disk, and we just discussed the ro ta tion about the cen ter o f mass .


And I call  this axis l.


And so it was ro ta ting like  this and was perpendicu lar to the d isk.


This  is the momen t of iner tia .


Bu t now I'm go ing to drill a hole here, and I have here an axis  l pr ime wh ich is parallel to  that one.


And I'm going  to force th is ob ject to ro tate about that ax is.


I can always do that--


I can drill a ho le have an axle, nicely fr ictionless bearing and I can force it to rota te abou t tha t.


What now  is the momen t o f inertia? If I know the moment o f iner tia , then I know how much

rotational kine tic energy there is .


That's one-ha lf I omega squared.


And now there is a theorem wh ich I w ill no t prove , but it's very easy to prove, and  tha t is called

the parallel axis theorem.


And that says tha t the moment of inertia o f ro ta tion about l prime--


provided tha t l pr ime is parallel to l--


is the momen t o f iner tia when the object ro tates about an axis  l through the cen ter o f mass plus

the mass of  the disk times the dis tance d squared.


So th is is the mass.


And that's a very easy thing to apply , and tha t allows you now  in many cases , to find the moment

of inertia in situa tions which are no t very symmetr ic.


Imagine that you had to do  this ma thema tically , tha t you actually had to do an in tegra tion o f a ll

these elemen ts mi from th is po int on .


That wou ld be a comple te headache.


In fact, I wouldn't even know how to do that.


So it's grea t.


Once you have demons trated, once you have proven that this para llel axis theorem works, then,

of course , you can always use it to your advantage.


Notice that the momen t o f iner tia for rotation abou t this axis--


which is no t through a cen ter o f mass--


is always  larger than the one through the cen ter .


You see, you have th is md squared ; it's always  larger.


There is a second theorem wh ich some times comes  in handy, and that only works when you deal

with very thin objec ts, and  that is called the perpend icular axis theorem.


If you have some kind o f a crazy ob ject--


which o f course we will never g ive you ; we'll always give you a square or we'll g ive you a disk...


Bu t it has to be a thin plate .


Otherw ise the perpend icular axis theorem doesn' t work.


And suppose I'm rota ting it abou t an ax is perpendicular to the blackboard through that poin t.


I call tha t the z axis .


It's sticking ou t to you .


That's the positive z axis.


I can draw now any xy axis where I please , at 90-degree ang les, anywhere in the plane o f the

blackboard.


So I pick one here,  I call this x, and I pick one here and I call that y.


So z is poin ting towards you.


Remember , I always choose a positive righ t-handed coordinate system.


My x cross y is always  in the d irection o f z.


I a lways do  that.


And so you see that here , x cross y equals z.


Now, you can ro tate this th in p late about  this axis.


You can also ro ta te it about that axis .


And you can a lso ro ta te it abou t the z axis.


And then the perpendicular axis theorem, which your book proves  in just a few  lines, te lls you tha t

the momen t of inertia  for ro ta tion abou t this axis here is the same as the moment of inertia  for

rotation abou t x plus the momen t of iner tia for ro tation about the ax is y. 

And th is a llows you to some times ...


in combina tion w ith the paralle l ax is theorem to find momen ts o f inertia in case  that you have th in

plates which rotate about axes perpendicu lar to the p late or some times not even perpendicular .


Sometimes you can use... if you know  this and you know th is, then you can find tha t.


So both are use ful, and in assignment 7 I' ll give you a s imple problem so that you can apply the

perpendicular axis theorem.


There are applica tions where energy  is temporarily s tored in a rota ting d isk, and we ca ll those

disks flywheels.


And the ro ta tiona l kinetic energy can be consumed, then, a t a later time, so it's very economica l.


And th is ro tational kine tic energy can then be , perhaps , converted into elec tricity or  in other forms

of energy.


And there are really remarkably  inven tive and in trigu ing ideas on how th is can be done .


Of course, whe ther  it is practica l depends always on do llars and cen ts and to wha t ex ten t it is

economica lly feasible .


Bu t I have a lways, even when I was a small boy ...


I remember when I was seven years, it already occurred to me tha t all this heat that is produced

when cars s lam  their brakes--


all you're do ing is you produce heat; you lose all tha t kinetic energy of your  linear motion--


whether somehow that couldn't be used in a more effec tive way.


And th is is wha t I want  to discuss with you now and see where we stand.


This  is ac tually being taken seriously by the Depar tmen t o f Energy.


So I wan t to work ou t with you an example o f a car which is in the moun tains and which is going 
to go downhill. 

And the moun tains are very dangerous--

zigzag roads--

and so he or she can only go very slow ly. 

And the maximum speed tha t the person could use is a t most  ten miles per hour--

withou t killing him or herself--

which is abou t four meters per second . 

And so here is your car, and le t's assume you s tart ou t with zero speed. 

And le t's assume tha t the mass o f the car--

we'll g ive it nice numbers--

is just 1 ,000 kilograms . 

And so you zigzag down this road . 

Let us assume tha t the he igh t d ifference h--

let's give it a number, 500 meters... 

And you arrive here a t poin t p.


And you later have  to go back up again.


What is your kinetic energy when you reach poin t p? Well, you have a speed of four meters per

second, and as you wen t down , you've been brak ing all the  time.


One way or ano ther, you go t rid o f your speed and tha t's all burned up--


heat, you heat up the un iverse.


So when you reach poin t p , your kinetic energy at  tha t point p is simp ly one-half mv squared.


m is the mass of the car , so  that is 500 times 16--


v squared--


so tha t is 8 ,000 joules .


Now compare th is with the work that gravity did in br ing ing this car down.


That work  is mgh , and mgh is a s taggering number.


1,000 times ten times 500--


that is five million jou les! And all of  tha t was converted to hea t using the brakes . 

It actually even gives you a lso wear and  tear on the brakes.


So who needs  it? Is there perhaps a way tha t you can salvage it or maybe no t all of it, maybe part

of it? And the answer is yes, there are ways.


At least in principle there are ways.


You can insta ll a d isk in your car, which I wou ld ca ll, then, a flywheel, And you can conver t the

gravita tiona l poten tia l energy.


You can convert that to kine tic energy of ro tation in your flywheel.


And to show you that it is no t complete ly absurd , I will put, actually , in some numbers.


Suppose you had a disk  in your car which had a rad ius of half a meter .


That's no t complete ly absurd .


That's no t beyond my  imagination.


That's a s izable disk.


And I give it a modes t mass--


so tha t the mass o f the car  is not going to be too high--


200 kilograms.


That's reasonab le.


That wou ld be a steel pla te only five cen timeters thick, so tha t's quite reasonable .


And the momen t o f iner tia of  this disk if I rota te it about an axis through the cen ter perpendicu lar

to the disk--


that momen t o f iner tia , we know now , is one-half m...


oh, we have a capital M--


R squared , and tha t equals 25 .


The units are kilograms , if you're interested , k ilograms/meter squared.


So we know the moment o f inertia.


Now, what we wou ld like to do is we would like to convert a ll this gravitationa l po ten tia l energy

into kine tic energy of that disk.


If you think o f a clever way tha t you can coup le tha t--


people have succeeded in that--


then you really would like one-half I omega squared...


You would rea lly  like tha t to be five times ten to  the s ix joules.


And so tha t immed iately tells you wha t omega should be for  that disk , and you find , then , if you

put in your numbers, which is trivial...


you find tha t omega is about 632 rad ians per second , so the frequency o f the disk  is 100 her tz,

100 revolutions per second .


I don't think tha t tha t is par ticularly ex travagan t.


So as you wou ld come down  the hill, you would no t be braking by pushing on your brake , you

would not be hea ting up your brakes, bu t you wou ld somehow conver t this energy  into the

rotating disk and tha t would slow you down .


So the slowdown , the "braking"  is now done because of a conversion from your  linear speed--


which comes from gravita tional potential energy--


to the rotation of the d isk.


And when you need that energy , you tap it.


So you should also be able to get the ro ta tiona l kinetic energy ou t and convert that aga in into

forward mo tion.


And if you could rea lly do this , then you could go back uphill and you wouldn't have to use any

fuel.


All your five million joules can be consumed,  then , in an ideal case , and you would no t have to

use any fue l.


Now, you can ask yourself the question, is th is system only use ful in the moun tains or could you

also use th is in a city? Well, o f course you can use it in a city .


You wouldn't be braking like  this,  then , but again, you would s low down by taking ou t kinetic

energy o f linear forward mo tion , dump tha t into kine tic energy o f ro ta tion o f your flywheel and  that

would s low you down.


And when the tra ffic  light turns green, you convert it back--


rotational kine tic energy  in to linear kine tic energy--


and you keep going again .


Now, of course,  this  is all easier sa id than done, bu t it is not comple te fan tasy.


Peop le have ac tually made some interesting s tudies , and I wou ld like to show you at leas t one

case tha t I am aware o f, tha t I found on the Web , tha t shows you that United Sta tes Energy

Departmen t is taking th is qu ite serious ly.


This view graph is also on the 801 home page .


And so you see here the idea of moun ting such a flywheel under the car here.


And it has the location of the " flywhee l energy managemen t power p lan t." Wonderful word , isn't

it? And here you see a c lose-up of this flywheel.


I d idn't ge t any numbers on it.


I don't know which frac tion o f the energy can be s tored  in your flywheel, but it's an a ttemp t.


Peop le are seriously thinking about it.


And it may happen in  the next decade tha t cars may come on the market whereby some o f your

energy, at leas t, can be salvaged .


Instead o f hea ting up the universe, use it yourself, wh ich could be very economical.


I have here a toy car--


I'll show  it on TV firs t.


And th is toy car has a flywhee l.


Do you see it? That the flywheel itse lf is the whee l o f the car, bu t the idea is there.


In this case, I cannot convert linear mo tion in to the flywheel.


I cou ld do tha t, bu t I'm going to do it in a reverse way.


I'm going to give th is flywhee l a lo t of kine tic energy of rotation , and you will see shor tly how I do

that.


And then I will show you tha t that can be conver ted back into forward motion--


in this case , it's very easy because the flywhee l itself is the wheel.


So le t me try to ... power th is car.


I do  tha t with this p lastic ... okay.


So I'm going to put some energy into this wheel, into  this flywheel, and then we'll see whe ther the

car can use  that  to s tart moving .


Great that my lec ture no tes were  there.


So , you see , it works.


And , o f course, if you could reverse that idea , that when the car ...


before it s tops, ge t it back  into  the flywheel, then you have the idea that I was trying  to get across.


Very economical, and definitely tha t w ill happen some time in the  future .


Flywheels are used more o ften than you may think .


MIT, a t the Magne t Lab, has two  flywhee ls wh ich are amazing .


They have a radius, I th ink, o f 2 .4 meters--


that is correct--


and each one o f those flywheels has a s tunning mass of 85 tons , 85 ,000 kilograms...


and they ro ta te at about six hertz.


You can ca lcula te the moment o f inertia.


They ro ta te abou t their cen ter axis perpendicular to the plane.


You know now wha t one-half I omega square is, and so you can ca lcula te the kine tic energy of

rotation .


And that kine tic energy of rotation is, then, a whopping 200 million jou les in each o f those rotating

flywhee ls.


Now, they use th is ro tational kine tic energy to crea te very strong magne tic fie lds on a time scale

as short as five seconds .


So they conver t mechan ical energy of rota tion to magnetic energy, which is no t part of 801 so I

will not go in to how they do that.


This  is par t o f 802 , and I'm sure all o f you are looking forward to 802, and that's when you will see

how you can convert mechanical energy in to magne tic energy.


We have already seen a demons tration in c lass whereby we converted mechanica l energy when

someone was rota ting, in to electr ic energy.


I think that was you, wasn' t it? And we got these ligh t bulbs on .


Well, you can also convert it into magne tic energy .


And then when they have created these strong magnetic fie lds tha t they do the ir research with

and when they wan t to get rid o f them,  they go the other way around and they dump that energy ,

that magne tic energy , back in to the  flywhee ls, who then star t sp inning again at six hertz .


Needless to say that huge amount o f ro ta tiona l kinetic energy must be stored in p lane ts and in

stars, and I would like to spend quite some  time on tha t.


It's a very  in teresting subject.


I will firs t d iscuss with you the sun and the ear th and see how much ro ta tiona l kinetic energy  is

stored in the ear th and in the sun .


This  is also on the 801 home page, so don' t copy this.


Let's first look a t the sun .


We have  the mass of  the sun, we have the radius o f the sun so you can calcula te the momen t o f

inertia o f the sun .


I have used my two-fifths mR squared , which is rea lly a crude approximation , because the two-

fifths m R squared for a solid sphere only holds if the mass is un iformly dis tribu ted throughou t tha t

sphere.


With a star , tha t's no t the case ; not with the ear th either ,


because the density is higher a t the cen ter.


Bu t this sort of gives you a crude idea.


So we have there the momen t of iner tia , which is easy to calcula te with tha t two- fifths mR

squared, and I ge t the same for the ear th .


This  is the radius of the earth , and you see  the momen t of iner tia o f the ear th.


Now I wan t to know how much kinetic energy o f ro ta tion these objects have .


Well, the sun ro ta tes abou t its axis in 26 days , the earth in one day , and so I  finally conver t

everything to MKS un its and I find these numbers for the rotational kine tic energy.


Now, look at the number o f the sun--


1Î© times ten to the 36th joules.


Our grea t-grand fa thers mus t have been puzzled abou t where the solar energy came from--


the hea t and the light, where it came from.


And conceivab ly it came from rotation.


Maybe the sun is spinning down, is slowing down and maybe the energy tha t we ge t is no thing

but rota tional k inetic energy.


If that were the case , however, since the sun produces four times ten  to the 26 th watts--


four times ten  to the 26 th joules--


per second , it would on ly last 125 years.


So you can comple tely forget the idea that the energy from the sun tha t we now know, o f course ,

is nuclear , but our grea t-grandparents didn' t know tha t--


that  the energy would be tapped from kine tic energy of rotation .


Let's  look a t the ear th .


2Î© times ten to the 29th joules.


Well, let me try some thing ...


some fan tasy on you , some crazy, some ridiculous  idea and I'm te lling you first, it is rid iculous .


Remember that the wor ld consump tion...


Six billion peop le on earth consume abou t four times ten to  the 20th joules every year .


So if somehow ...

I thought if you could  tap the ro tational energy o f the earth by slowing the ear th down, maybe we

could use it to satis fy the world energy consump tion .


Um,  I wouldn' t know how  to do it, and it is, o f course , comple te fantasy .


All you would have  to do is slow the earth down by about... 2 .4 seconds.


After one year...

So you slow it down .


After one year, the day wouldn' t last...


Day and night wouldn't las t 24 hours bu t only 2.4 seconds longer.


Bu t, of course , a fter a billion years,  then , you wou ld have consumed up a ll the ro tational kine tic

energy and  then the earth would no longer be ro ta ting .


It is, o f course , a crazy  idea bu t some times it's cu te to speculate about crazy ideas.


There is an ob ject which we call the Crab Pulsar .


It is a neutron star and it is located in the Crab Nebula .


The Crab Nebula is the result of a supernova explosion tha t wen t o ff in the year 1054, and dur ing

my nex t lecture I w ill ta lk a lo t more about that.


For now , I jus t want to concen tra te on this neu tron star alone .


And so here you have  the data on  the Crab Pu lsar.


The mass of the Crab Pulsar  is not  too differen t from that o f the sun .


It's abou t 1Î©  times more .


The radius  is rid iculously sma ll--


it's only ten kilome ters.


All that mass is compact in a ten-kilometer-rad ius sphere.


It has a horrendous density o f ten  to the 14 th grams per cubic cen time ter.


So , o f course, the momen t o f iner tia is ex tremely modest compared to the sun, because  the

radius is so small and the moment o f inertia goes with the radius squared.


However, if you look at ro tational kine tic energy , the situation is very differen t, because this

neutron star ro tates  in 33 milliseconds about its ax is.


So it has a phenomenal angular velocity.


And so if now you ca lcula te one-half I omega squared , you ge t a  fantastic amoun t o f rota tional

kinetic energy .


You ge t an amount which is more than a million  times more than you have in the sun.


And th is ob ject, this pulsar  in the Crab Nebula is radia ting copious amoun ts of x-rays, of gamma

rays.


There are jets coming out o f ionized gas , and we are certain that all tha t energy tha t this objec t is

producing comes from rotational kine tic energy.


And I will g ive you convincing argumen ts why there is no doub t abou t tha t.


If you take the Crab Pulsar and you calcula te how much energy comes ou t in x-rays and gamma 
rays and everything tha t you can observe in astronomy , then you find tha t it has a power roughly 
of abou t six times ten to the 31s t watts. 

It's a phenomena l amount if you compare tha t with the sun, by the way. 

The sun is only four times ten to the 26th wa tts. 

So the Crab Pulsar alone generates about 150 ,000 times more power than the sun . 

We know the period o f the pulsar to a very high degree of accuracy. 

The period of ro tation of the neutron s tar  is 0 .0335028583 seconds . 

That's wha t it is today . 

I called my radio as tronomy friends yesterday and  I asked them, "Wha t is the rota tion period of

the neu tron s tar  in the Crab Nebu la?" and this was the answer.


Tomorrow, however , it is  longer by 36.4 nanoseconds.


So tomorrow , you have  to add this .


That means  it's slowing down.


The Crab Pulsar  is slowing down.


That means omega is going down .


That means one-ha lf I omega square is going down.


And when you do your homework, which you should be able to do--


to compare  the rota tional k inetic energy today with the  rotational kine tic energy tomorrow--


you will see  that  the loss o f energy  is six times ten to the 31st joules per second, which is exactly

the power tha t we record in terms o f x-rays, gamma rays and other forms o f energy.


So there's no ques tion that in the case o f this rota ting neutron star , a ll the energy tha t it radia tes

is at  the expense of ro tational kine tic energy.


It's a mind-boggling concept when you  think of it.


And if the neu tron s tar  in the Crab Nebu la were to continue to lose ro ta tional kinetic energy a t

exactly this rate , then it would come to a halt in abou t 1 ,000 years.


Now I wou ld like to show you a few slides , and I might as well cover this up so tha t we get it very

dark in th is room.


I want to show you the Crab Nebula , and I think I will also show you the beau tiful flywheels  in the

Magne t Lab .


Now I need a  flashlight.


I need my  laser poin ter.


I need a lot of stuff.


Okay, there we go , so I'm going to make it dark.


You ready for that? Okay , if I can ge t the firs t slide .


What you see here are these flywheels at the Magnet Lab.


These are the wheels that have a mass of 85  tons and that have a radius o f 2 .5 me ters--


an incred ible , ingen ious device, and you can s tore in there 200 million joules, and you can dump

it into magnetic energy and in five seconds dump it back into kinetic energy o f ro tation .


It is an amazing accomp lishment, by the way.


And here you see the Crab Nebula.


The Crab Nebula is at a distance from us o f about 5 ,000 light-years .


It is the remnan t o f a supernova explosion in the year 1054--


much more about that during my next lec ture--


and what you see here is no t s tuff tha t is genera ted at this moment in  time by  the pulsar.


This, by the way , is the pulsar, and  the red filaments that you see here is ma teria l tha t was thrown

off when  the explosion occurred .


The explosion , the supernova exp losion throws the outer layers of the s tar w ith a huge speed--


some 10,000 k ilometers per second--


into space, and tha t is wha t you are seeing.


From here to here is abou t seven ligh t-years to give you an idea o f the size of this object.


This pulsar a lone , however, generates the...

six times 31 ... watts.


And we do know tha t it is this star that is the pu lsar and we know tha t it is not that star .


And the way that  that was observed , tha t tha t was measured, is as fo llows .


A s troboscopic pic ture, a stroboscopic exposure was made o f the cen ter portion o f the Crab

Nebula .


And a s troboscopic pic ture means tha t you are using a shutter which opens and closes .


In this case, you have to open and close it with exac tly the same  frequency as the rota tion o f the

neutron star .


This neutron s tar--


for reasons that is no t we ll understood--


is blinking at us.


It blinks a t us at exac tly the frequency of its ro tation, 33 milliseconds.


That means 30 hertz .


Roughly 30 times per second you see the s tar become bright and then go dim again .


If now you se t your frequency o f your shu tter of your ...


in front o f your pho tographic pla te a t exactly that frequency and you expose the pho tograph ic

plate on ly when the star  is br ight, then you will see a very brigh t star when you deve lop your

picture .


If now you take ano ther pic ture, expose it the same amount of  time, bu t the shu tter  is open when

the s tar  is d im and you develop tha t p icture , the star is dim.


Bu t the beau ty  is that all o ther stars  in the vicin ity , o f course, w ill show up on both pho tographic 
plates with exactly the same streng th because they are not blinking a t you , since they don' t blink 
at us with a period of 33 milliseconds. 

That is wha t you will see on  the next slide, which is a s troboscopic exposure .


This s tar  is clear ly no t the pu lsar as  it is abou t equally bright on both exposures.


This  is no t the pu lsar, but  this one is.


You see,  this one is missing here .


And so this  is beyond any question tha t we know exac tly which the pu lsar is .


A very new observatory was  launched only recently , and that is ca lled the Chandra X-ray

Observatory .


And Chandra made a picture very recently o f the Crab Nebula , o f the pu lsar, and that's wha t I 
want to show you now. 

It's on the Web, and I show you a p icture that many of you probab ly haven't seen yet, which is the 
center part of  the Crab Nebula , and the pu lsar is  loca ted here .


And all  this  is x-rays, no thing to do with op tical light.


This  is all x-rays, and you see there is a huge nebula here around this pulsar which is abou t two

light-years across, and all  that energy in x-rays is all a t the expense of ro tational kine tic energy of

the pulsar , wh ich is quite amazing .


And when this p icture was made w ith Chandra X-ray Observatory, they discovered immediate ly

that  the pulsar also produces a jet.


Maybe you can see that  from where you are s itting .


There is a je t coming out here , and w ith a little bit o f imagina tion you can see  this  jet going out

there .


All that energy  is at the expense of rotational kine tic energy.


MIT has a big stake, by the way, in  the Chandra Observatory, and no t only MIT but Cambridge as

a whole.


The Center for Astrophysics and MIT are runn ing the Chandra Science Center , from wh ich a ll

radio commands are given , wh ich is here jus t across the stree t, a few b locks away .


And many MIT scientists have dedica ted the major par t of their careers in  this endeavor .


And these are one o f the wonderful results tha t have come out.


All righ t, you now have five minutes  le ft.


You have a little more--


you have seven minutes le ft.


I would apprecia te it a lo t if you fill out  the questionna ire, because tha t's the only way we can ge t 
your feedback and we can make changes  if you th ink these changes are necessary. 

So , see you Friday.
