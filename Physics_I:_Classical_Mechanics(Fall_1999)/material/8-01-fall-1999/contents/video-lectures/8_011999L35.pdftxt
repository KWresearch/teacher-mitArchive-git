8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 35 

Today I'd like to  talk with you about my early days at MIT and the research tha t I did here .


This  is a long  time ago.


I go t my Ph.D . in the Ne therlands, in nuclear physics , and I came to MIT in January 1966, almos t

34 years ago.


And the idea was tha t I was on ly go ing to spend here one year on a postdoc position , but I liked it

so much  tha t I never le ft, and I don't regret it.


I joined the X-ray As tronomy group here o f Pro fessor Rossi.


Now, X-ray astronomy has to be done  from above  the Earth a tmosphere or at leas t near the top

of the Earth a tmosphere because the X rays are absorbed by air , un like optical astronomy and

radio as tronomy, which can be done from the ground .


The kind of X rays tha t we measure are no t unlike those that your den tist is using when he takes

an X-ray pic ture .


The energy range of these X rays is somewhere between one and 30 , 40 k ilo-elec tron volts , and 
if you don't know wha t a kilo-e lectron volt is, that's fine,  too, bu t you never express the energy o f 
an X ray  in terms of jou les, because the number becomes so rid iculously small. 

During World War II, under Hitler's Germany , Wernher von Braun developed the V-2 rocke ts for 
destructive war purposes . 

It was developed in Peenemuende .


And after the war , the Americans used these V-2 rocke ts for scien tific purposes, and the firs t

rocket fligh ts to search for X rays from the Sun took place in 1948 .


And X rays were found from  the Sun.


That was quite a surprise .


And the power, energy per second tha t the Sun pu ts ou t in X rays divided by the power  in optical,

which is almost all the radia tion o f the Sun--


I'll give it  the symbo l o f the Sun--


is approxima tely 10 to the minus 7 , so on ly one  ten-millionth o f a ll the energy comes out in X

rays.


So , from an energy po int o f view, it's very, very little .


It varies a great deal, too.


Bu t it is rea lly very  little.


In 1962 , scien tis ts here in Cambridge, among them Pro fessor Bruno Rossi, who was a professor

at MIT, and R iccardo Giacconi and Herb Gursky--


who were working across the stree t at American Science and Engineering--


attemp ted to do an exper iment to see whe ther they cou ld de tect X rays from objec ts outside our

solar system.


Now, the odds were very low tha t they were going  to succeed, and the reason is very simple .


If you take the Sun and you move it ou t to the nearest stars, which is typically ten to a hundred

light-years , you wouldn' t s tand a chance to see X rays.


In fact, the sensitivity o f the de tec tors in  these days was too low by at leas t nine orders of

magnitude, a fac tor o f one billion .


To everyone's surprise--


to everyone's, yeah , happy surprise , I should say--


they succeeded, and they discovered an objec t wh ich was la ter ca lled Sco X-1.


It's  in the cons tella tion Scorpius , "X" s tands for X rays , and "1" for the first X-ray source in tha t

constella tion.


The to tal power ou tpu t o f tha t source was abou t 10 ,000 times more than the Sun .


That doesn' t make  the source so special, because there are many stars in the sky tha t radia te

way more energy than our Sun does, bu t what's so very special abou t Sco X-1, that  the X-ray

power over the optica l power for Sco X-1 was approximately 1,000.


In o ther words , the X rays are the dominan t source o f energy and the optical is sort o f, le t's ca ll it

a by-produc t, whereas with the Sun , the op tical is the main thing and the X rays is sort of a by-

product.


And so the $64 ques tion in  those days was , what can these objects be? They must be very

differen t from  the Sun, and that's wha t I want  to d iscuss with you .


When I came  to MIT in 1966 , there were about six o f these X-ray sources known in the sky.


Today there are thousands known , bu t there were six then.


And they were discovered  from rocket fligh ts.


These rocke ts would be launched, typ ically from White Sands , and they would spend about  five

minu tes above the Earth a tmosphere .


And during those five minu tes they scanned the sky, and six sources were discovered .


I joined here the group of Professor George C lark, who is s till a pro fessor a t MIT.


He was working on observations to be made from very high-fly ing balloons.


So we would build a telescope , and we would launch it on a balloon , and go near the top o f the

Earth a tmosphere .


It's not as good as a rocke t flight which ge ts comple tely out o f the Earth a tmosphere , but the

fligh ts on balloons can las t way  longer than  five-minu te rocket fligh ts.


We cou ld fly hours and, if we were lucky , even days , but the price we paid for tha t is that even 
though  there was only very  little a tmosphere le ft above us--

about 0 .3 percent o f the atmosphere was  le ft--

still that caused an effec t o f the absorp tion , so we did lose X rays tha t the rocket  fligh ts did not 
lose. 

Bu t we had  the great advantage o f many, many hours.


To g ive you a rough idea o f what it took  in those days--


I worked on  this w ith graduate studen ts and w ith many undergradua te students--


a te lescope in those days , to build it cost typica lly a million dollars, and it would  take us two years

to build one .


The balloons tha t we needed to launch them were about $100 ,000 in those days , and the helium

that we needed to ge t it up was abou t $80,000, and the weigh t of such a payload , o f our

telescope , was about 1 ,000 kilograms .


These balloons would go up to 140 ,000 feet and  they were huge--


they were about 500 fee t across.


I will show you p ictures of  them very shortly .


It was a risky business  in tha t no guaran tee of success.


You bought the balloons.


If they worked , so much the be tter.


If they didn't work,  tough luck .


There was jus t no way tha t you could recover the money.


They were very thin; the balloons are made of polye thylene, and the thickness of the polyethylene

was th inner than cigarette paper , so you can imagine how easy  it is to damage  them, and if you 
don't damage them during the launch, it's easy to damage them on  the way up, due to the je t 
stream and  the very cold layers of air that you have in the tropopause . 

So I would like to show you now some slides , and then we will get back to ta lking a little bit more

about X-ray as tronomy.


All righ t, so le t's see wha t we have first.


You see here two o f my undergraduate studen ts.


At  the time they were undergradua te students .


Now they are bo th Ph.D .s, and some of you may think that science doesn't have much romance , 
but there is a lot. 

They married and they have kids.


This  is Pat Downey; she's s till very  importan t in working with me on PIVoT, and th is is Jim

Ballantine .


They were working on the elec tronics, which is an enormously ted ious task,  to do the wiring o f the

electronics .


And here you see the plan t in Texas where these ba lloons were built.


These were ex tremely  long halls, as you can imagine.


And here the gores o f the balloon , wh ich are like p ieces tha t you see on a tangerine , on the

surface o f a tangerine , they were sealed together with heat sealers .


And only women were allowed to do th is work because it was well known  that men are too 
impa tien t and make many more mis takes. 

And so only women were allowed there.


It was noth ing to do with discrimina tion , but simply because women were be tter a t do ing th is

work.


Here, a balloon comes out o f a box .


This  is a pic ture I took  in Texas , where we launched ba lloons from.


It's nicely covered with this pink sheet and we have this huge clo th on the grass because the

balloon is so thin that if you would put it on the grass, it would get damaged right away .


I told you , the skin is about...


thinner than cigare tte paper, so it's care fully taken ou t and we inspec t it closely .


And in th is case , there was some concern that there might be a ho le in the ba lloon .


In fact, there was a t least a hole in the p ink cover , and so we care fully inspected whe ther the hole

propagated deeper  in .


I wasn' t too worried, because this was no t my balloon, but nevertheless, it's always sad if you see

some of your co lleagues having a balloon tha t doesn't get up.


And now I'm taking you  to the deser t town in Australia, central Australia--


Alice Springs .


I've launched many balloons from Alice Springs .


And now you get a pretty good idea o f what  the launch  is going to be like.


Here is the launch truck, and the telescope is on the launch truck.


And all o f this  is emp ty balloon, and here is wha t we call the ro ller arm--


it holds the ba lloon down, and only this part of the balloon is going to be inflated.


Here is the he lium truck, and here are the inflation tubes through which we inflate .


The inflation takes place almos t a lways ear ly morning or near sunset in the evening , because

that's when  the wind is very calm, and we need very ca lm conditions .


It is this par t o f the ba lloon that is going to be inflated, and so there's going to be a huge force , the

buoyant force--


I hope you a ll remember Archimedes' Law--


of severa l thousands o f kilograms' force up.


And so this vehicle here weighs about  four or five tons to hold it down.


And when we launch  the balloon, we actually release this arm; we flip this arm up .


And so you will see, then, how  the balloon will make it on the way up .


So th is is Alice Spr ings, Austra lia , again .


The Sun is rising , and we s tarted the in fla tion .


You see here the in fla tion  tubes , and we pu t the he lium in the ba lloon .


This  is the very critical phase of the launch , because if there's a little b it of side wind and the

balloon  touches the ground, then it's all over .


Then it jus t gets damaged , and you abort--


you don' t even con tinue.


This  is a little later, when the... we call this the bubb le.


This  is the ro ller arm here , and th is is all this emp ty balloon in your direc tion , and this par t is only

some 80 fee t high or so .


And here you see these gores tha t I to ld you about earlier.


This  is all this tedious work tha t is done by these women, who sea l these gores together, and

they all come  toge ther here at the apex, in a big aluminum pla te.


All righ t, now you see the situa tion from the launch truck site .


Here you see the radar reflectors , so we can follow the  fligh t by radar; you see the te lescope

here--


I won't go in to too many deta ils.


This  is a ballast box, wh ich con tains about 500 pounds of lead shot, which we can drop on rad io

command .


I be lieve this was Jeffrey McClintock, who was one o f my graduate s tuden ts a t the  time.


You see here the parachu te .


There's a connec tion be tween the parachu te and the bottom o f the balloon and we can cu t tha t

on radio command , and then  the telescope, we hope , parachutes safe ly back to Earth .


And here's all empty balloon , and here is the bubble, that part that was  just in fla ted .


They're s till in fla ting here, bu t they are a lready tying o ff  this  inflation tube, so we are ac tually

getting very close to a launch.


And here is the moment o f launch .


This  is a moment that no one will ever forget who wa tches a balloon launch .


You feel ants  in your pants and bu tterflies in your stomach.


It is a very tense moment.


If th ings go wrong,  this, in general, is the momen t tha t things go wrong, because when  the ro ller

arm is here released, then th is enormous amoun t of free lift, the buoyant force, drives this thing

up and you ge t a bouncing effec t.


You ge t an oscillation of  the helium in th is upper part--


we call this the mushroom.


And that can already destroy the balloon right away .


The layou t is such tha t we a lways lay ou t so tha t the wind will drive the balloon towards the

launch truck.


And you will see la ter on why that has to be done.


So the launch truck can maneuver  itself straigh t under the ba lloon , and make sure tha t the

balloon is carrying the telescope be fore we re lease the payload .


The payload is now tied to the launch truck.


We have  to wait  for the whole ba lloon  to be o ff the ground be fore the launch truck can ac tually

maneuver  itself under the balloon , but you already see that  the ...


by the exhaust that the engines are already running.


You see a close-up here o f th is mushroom, and it makes a tremendous amoun t o f noise .


It's really scary.


I'm always surprised , when I see a launch like this , tha t the ba lloon , so thin , can ac tually survive

this tormen ting launch.


So here it goes higher, comes in  this direction , as you see, getting closer and closer to  the launch

truck, r ises higher  in the sky and , in th is case in Alice Springs, I was so close to the launch  that  I

couldn't follow  the bubble go ing up much  further with my camera , so the next pic ture tha t you're

going to see I took from Pales tine , Texas , from wh ich I've flown many ba lloons .


So it's a differen t launch , but it is sort o f the same s tage in the launch tha t you see here .


Alice Springs was beau tiful, by the way , always very nice, clear skies ; it's a very fan tastic deser t

there .


It's a wonderful desert town.


It's really  in the midd le of nowhere.


Okay, so now we're in Texas and you see here the launch truck .


This  is the telescope, it was a different telescope .


You see the parachu te , and now the  trick is for the truck to ge t under the balloon .


The amount o f helium tha t is  in the balloon is only a small fraction of the to tal volume.


It's  just enough for us to get  the free lift.


We want to go up a t about a thousand feet per minute, and then , since the atmospheric pressure

goes down when the balloon goes up,  the helium expands and finally fills the entire volume , as

you will see .


So now  is the moment, this  is a crucia l momen t tha t the launch truck has actua lly maneuvered

itself s traigh t under the ba lloon .


And now the person on  the launch truck makes sure that there is enough tension in  these lines to

pick up the  telescope .


If the balloon were a little bit  too far ahead or too far behind and you released the  telescope , then,

of course , it wou ld pendulum in to the ground and you would lose it, so it's very  important that it be

done when the ba lloon is straight overhead .


Bu t tha t a lone is not enough;  there mus t also be enough pull on it so  tha t the te lescope doesn' t

crash to the ground vertica lly.


And when there is any chance that things go wrong, we just abor t the  fligh t, because the

telescope is so much more expensive than  the balloon, even though the ba lloon and  the helium

toge ther  is close  to a quarter-million dollars.


And here you see it after release : payload , parachu te, emp ty ba lloon and here , the he lium.


And th is, from here to here , oh, is abou t two- thirds of the height o f the Emp ire State Building .


These are huge, huge balloons.


And here you see it at an altitude of 150,000 fee t.


This  is the largest ba lloon  that was ever flown successfully.


It's still the world record .


It was a ba lloon with a vo lume of 52 million cub ic fee t.


This p icture was taken  through a te lescope .


And you see here the te lescope , and you can look straight through the balloon ; it's tha t th in.


From here to here is abou t 500 feet, a lmost 600 feet.


All righ t, here you see my ex-gradua te student.


He's now Dr. Ricker, George Ricker.


He's still a s taff member a t MIT.


This  is in Austra lia .


A lot o f this equipment was built by undergradua tes and gradua te students o f mine ; a lot o f it we

borrowed from the balloon launch ing sta tions .


And the rad io data come in here, and we can command the telescope from here .


We can orien t the telescope , we can draw ba llast and, very importan t, we can terminate  the flight.


So tha t we rescue , that we save the te lescope when it starts drifting ou t over the ocean .


Because the balloon s tarts going with the w inds a t the altitude o f 150,000 fee t, and those winds

can vary anywhere from 20, 30 miles per hour up  to 100 miles per hour.


We try to fly only during  the days tha t the wind is  low , and that's the case in the spring, and in  the

fall, we call tha t the turnaround .


The w inds at these a ltitudes change twice per year.


They change from abou t 100 miles per hour to the west, to 100 miles per hour to the eas t.


It happens in the spring and in the fall, and that's when we try to  fly, when  the winds are very  low ,

when they are in the process o f turn ing around .


We follow the balloon at low altitude--


5,000 , 6,000 fee t.


It's a small airplane .


I'm sitting here on the airplane.


This  is a typ ical airplane tha t we use to hop from a irport to airport and stay as close  to the balloon

as we can, so tha t we can give  the " termina te" command.


And la ter we can recover the payload, which is an adventure all by  itself.


In Aus tralia , tha t is much harder than in the United Sta tes.


This was El Paso, bu t in Aus tralia , there are no airpor ts  in the deser t, and so that is way harder to

hop from place to place .


I'm taking you to Australia now, here is Alice Springs.


And when we launched this fligh t,  the days be fore , we had ba lloons , weather balloons, tes t 
balloons , which we drove up  to 140,000, 150,000 fee t, and then we probed the w inds at that 
altitude . 

And the people who did  tha t g ive us good reasons to believe tha t the ba lloon wou ld either go sort 
of in this direc tion or maybe here , but in any case, it would go nor th-nor thwes t. 

And so we a lerted all these radar sta tions  in Australia to look ou t for the ba lloon--

that we have radar reflectors , so they could g ive us an early warning, because be tween here and 
here, there are really no airports. 

So if we follow this by airp lane , you can land dur ing the day at some a ir str ips, bu t rea lly, there 
are really no runways , so that's pretty dangerous . 

At night, you cou ldn't land here.


And so we were hop ing that these radar stations would give us an ear ly alert and te ll us where

the balloon is.


What happened , however,  the balloon went stra igh t down.


And then it was sunset, so we don' t know exac tly where the balloon is a t sunse t.


We can' t see it, bu t we have radio contac t with it and so we were flying close to it.


And then at sunrise we picked it up , we cou ld see it, and then here, when it was getting close to

forbidden zone--


because there is commercial fligh ts here--


we cut it down , so we gave the radio command which separates the parachute  from  the balloon.


The balloon is very br ittle--


it's very cold there .


The balloon sha tters, breaks  in p ieces, comes down and, if everyth ing goes well, then  the

parachute brings the telescope sa fely back to Earth .


This  is the person tha t we con tac ted during that  fligh t.


You try to draw the a ttention of loca l people , and you do that by flying w ith your airplane low over

their house .


This person lived in the deser t, and his neares t neighbor was from 70 miles away from him.


He was crazy , he was always drunk...


[students  laugh]


he was shoo ting kangaroos  in the deser t.


There is no windshield here .


He wou ld dr ive 60 miles an hour , and then he wou ld chase these kangaroos and shoot them.


And he had a crazy game which I didn' t like at all. 

He wou ld put the dog on the roof--

and he gave me a demonstra tion once ; I was with him in th is truck--

and he wou ld drive 60 miles per hour , would slam the brakes, and the dog would ca tapult through 
the air, and  then he would say, "You can't teach an o ld dog any new tr icks." We encountered 
wonderfu l animals during recovery: koala bear , quie t, peaceful, very lazy, un like mos t 8.01 
studen ts. 

[students  laugh] 

And then , when we got closer to payload--


it took us a day and a half to ge t to the payload--


there was this nasty  iguana, he was abou t six feet long.


And le t me te ll you, I was really scared.


It scared the hell out of me .


Bu t o f course I d idn't wan t to show that, so  I said to my graduate studen t, "There's no problem,

these animals are harmless; you go first."


[laughter ]


And he d id, and it turns ou t they are harmless, and dur ing the en tire four hours that it  took us to

recover the payload and ge t it on Jack's truck, this animal was  just sitting s till, didn' t move a t a ll.


That is his way o f thinking that we don' t see him, then .


Beau tiful animals , these iguanas.


The aborigines eat them, it's very precious food , by the way.


So here you see Don Brooks, who was an American who came w ith me .


He was an electronic expert, and this  is Alice, which was the wife of Jack.


You see the payload here,  tumbled over, bu t it's  in good condition.


The crash pad is there purposely to protect agains t the  impac t, to get a lower decelera tion, and ,

of course , it's okay tha t tha t cardboard crash pad is des troyed--


that's the whole idea.


And then when you come back a  few days la ter  in Alice Springs, it's... no thing happens , ever , in

Alice Springs .


I mean , it's comple tely a hole in the ground.


So th is front-page news, "Perfec t Balloon Launch" and  "1,000 watch  the star t o f a space probe"--


they ca lled it a space probe .


I had a long interview w ith  this news reporter , and I told him tha t the reason why we have to go

high is because o f the absorp tion o f the X rays  in the Earth atmosphere , but  the article d idn't ge t 
that across. 

They said, "They fly ba lloons because then they're closer to  the s tars." Well, I suppose  tha t is 
close enough, bu t it really missed the issue o f the absorption o f the X rays, which o f course ... 
that's the reason why we have to go up , not because we wan t to ge t closer to the stars. 

Okay, so now  I'll go back to the blackboard, if I can find my way.


So between 1966 and rough ly late  '70s , I had abou t 20 successful fligh ts from the United Sta tes ,

from Canada, and many from Aus tralia.


Now, we a lso had some prob lems , we had some bad luck.


Twice during my fligh ts, the balloons popped .


70,000  feet, there is the tropopause; it's very co ld, -70 degrees.


There are jet winds and they beat on the balloon, and then the balloon can burst.


And when that happens, we don' t have enough time to  termina te the fligh t--


we can' t separa te the parachute from  the balloon; it happens a ll of a sudden--


and then , in general, the parachu te ge ts en tangled and then you ge t a free fa ll.


So the payload is entire ly des troyed , and tha t happened tw ice.


Bu t we were lucky enough that a t severa l occasions we made some in teresting discoveries .


During the early years o f X-ray astronomy , we d iscovered five new X-ray sources, so we doubled

the number of sources tha t were known  from rocket  flights be fore us.


And some o f these sources tha t we saw  from balloons were highly variable .


We no ticed an X-ray flare ; the X-ray in tensity went up by a factor o f three or four on as  little time

as ten minu tes .


And that was comp lete ly new in those days, and that could not have been discovered  from

rockets, because the rockets themse lves are on ly five minu tes above the Earth a tmosphere , and 
they're not look ing at one source all the time. 

They are scanning the sky, because the ir objective was to find as many X-ray sources as they 
could.


Bu t we were up sometimes 26 hours, so we had plen ty of time to look a t one portion o f the sky for

a long time,  for hours on , and so it was no t an acciden t that we discovered  these flar ing events 
which lasted up to  ten minutes and longer. 

We a lso d iscovered an ob ject which we called "gx1+4"--

the number has to do w ith where it is in the sky--

and we no ticed , much to our surprise , tha t the X rays seemed  to fluc tua te in a per iodic fash ion, 
2.3 minutes. 

At  the time , we had no clue what that mean t, bu t later , as you w ill see very shortly, it became

clear that  that was the ro ta tion period o f a neutron star.


So the big question was, in the early days: What are these objec ts? And this  is some thing  tha t we

have discussed in 8 .01 and I will go over  it very briefly again , bu t we discussed it and you even

had some homework problems on it.


These objec ts are X-ray binaries, whereby one ob ject is very compact--


which cou ld be a neu tron star , or in some cases even a black hole--


and the other ob ject, the o ther s tar, is a normal nuclear burning s tar, someth ing like our Sun.


And they are very close  toge ther.


They are so close toge ther that the ma tter, which is here, is a ttrac ted by the neu tron star stronger

than it is attracted by the s tar  itse lf, and so it s tarts to find its way to the neu tron star .


This  is a binary system, so they go around each o ther.


This ma tter canno t just go in radially, bu t it wou ld sp iral in slow ly and find its way to the neu tron

star.


Strangely enough tha t we still don' t understand how  it makes  it, but it does make it, ultimate ly, to

the neu tron s tar, and  this  is, then, wha t we ca ll the accretion disk .


This  is the accretor and th is is the donor.


The donor provides the  fuel that finds  its way to the neutron star .


And if you take a little bit, mass m, and you drop tha t on a neu tron s tar--


and a neu tron star has mass capital M, say , and radius capital R--


then the kinetic energy that is released a t impact is something that all o f you should be able to do

next Monday.


That is the following : mMG divided by R equa ls one-half mV squared.


This  is the gravita tional po tential energy that becomes available if an objec t o f mass  little m

crashes onto the star .


The sur face of the s tar has a radius capital R ; the mass of the s tar  is capital M.


And that is converted  to kinetic energy, which is one-ha lf mV squared , so this is the speed at

impac t.


Of course, it's always independent o f little m, and so you can ca lcula te tha t speed and that speed

is horrendous for a neu tron star , the reason being tha t the radius o f the neu tron star  is so

absurdly small; it's only ten kilometers .


It is roughly 100 ,000 times smaller than the radius o f our Sun.


The mass of the neutron s tar is comparable to tha t of our Sun--


a little larger, bu t it's comparable .


Bu t it is the radius which is so small, and tha t's why you get a speed a t impact which is abou t

one-third o f the speed o f ligh t.


And th is kinetic energy  is converted  to heat--


for the same reason tha t when we drop some thing here on the  floor , tha t the kine tic energy

ultima tely goes  into heat--


and so it heats up the surface layers o f the neu tron star , and the temperature becomes

horrendously high , ten to the seven,  ten to the e igh th degrees--


10 million , 100 million degrees--


and a t tha t very high tempera ture, almos t a ll the energy , a lmos t all elec tromagne tic radia tion

comes out in the form o f X rays.


The Sun has a tempera ture o f on ly 6 ,000 degrees; most o f it comes out in the form o f optical

light, but when you go to 10 million degrees, tha t's no longer the case.


The spectrum sh ifts in favor o f the X rays.


The amount o f energy tha t is released is horrendous.


To g ive you some fee ling for that, if you take a marshmallow and you throw a marshmallow from

a large dis tance on to a neutron star, then the energy that is released, which is th is energy, is 
comparab le to the energy tha t was released o f the a tomic bomb tha t was thrown on Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki. 

So tha t te lls you something abou t the enormous gravita tiona l forces tha t are a t work on the

surface o f a neutron s tar.


We know now wha t these systems are; the evidence is overwhelming .


We have observed  the rota tion o f the neu tron stars .


The 2.3 minu tes tha t we found , we now know  is the ro tation o f the neu tron star .


These neutron s tars have a strong magnetic field , and the matter tha t accretes on to the neu tron

star reaches the magnetic po les.


In 8 .02 you will see ...


you will learn why this plasma, which is high ly ionized , why that canno t just reach the neutron star

anywhere, bu t it is forced to on ly en ter the neutron star near the magnetic po les, and if the

neutron star ro tates , then  the magne tic poles can ro tate like this.


And when you are on Ear th, you see X rays, X rays, X rays, no X rays , X rays and so you see

pulsations.


And so these pulsa tions have been seen  from many neutron stars now,  from many of these

binary systems.


It's very clear that it's a binary system.


If you are in the plane or near the p lane o f the orbits o f the two stars , then  the neu tron s tar can go

behind the donor, and  then you don't see any X rays, because the X rays are then absorbed by

the donor .


And then you see an X-ray eclipse, so the X rays vanish.


So you would see the pu lsations, strong X-ray signal, and all o f a sudden, boom--


it's gone.


And then a few hours  later , it star ts up again when the neutron star reappears, reemerges from

the donor star .


So tha t picture is all very c lear, bu t I do want  to show you a t least a sketch of wha t we think such

a system would look  like , which is just the nex t slide , and maybe the person in  the boo th...


Oh, I can do it  from here .


So th is is wha t it sort of looks like .


You see the donor there on the le ft, and you see here the neu tron star , or it could be a b lack ho le-

-


that's sort o f the same idea, you would not be able  to te ll--


and you see how the ma tter swirls  in.


Of course this  is a no t a rea l p icture , this  is a ske tch made by an illus trator.


We know hundreds o f these systems  in our own galaxy , and, o f course , there are many in o ther

galaxies as we ll.


I d iscussed with you in 8.01  tha t if you measure  the Doppler shifts o f these stars--


and if you are lucky , you ge t the Dopp ler sh ift both  from the pu lsations o f the neutron star and

from the optical lines  in the donor--


that you can even find the mass o f both the s tar here and the s tar there .


And if the mass becomes horrendously high, as  in some cases, then you have to conclude that

you are dealing with a black hole .


And you had a problem on sec tion ...


in one o f your homework assignmen ts.


I'm no longer flying ba lloons , because all the work that I do nowadays  is done , o f course, from

satellites .


You ge t 365 days per year data , you are always above the Ear th atmosphere, so tha t's clearly the

way to go .


And I have used European sa tellites , Japanese sa tellites, and nowadays I am using the Rossi X-
ray Timing Explorer , which is an American sate llite, and Chandra , which was  launched early this 
year, wh ich is the bigges t thing in town . 

In 1975 , here a t MIT we had our own sa tellite, called SAS-3. 

And we opera ted SAS-3 from the Cen ter for Space Research, wh ich is Building 37 , where my 
office is , 365 days per year, 24 hours per day. 

And in  '75 , Josh Grindley,  from Harvard , and John Heise in Utrech t, the Netherlands ,  discovered 
something which we call an X-ray burst. 

And an X-ray burst is a phenomenon tha t you see the X-ray signal become very strong all o f a 
sudden. 

In abou t one second, it becomes ten times s tronger , maybe 20 times stronger than it was be fore 
the burst, and it pe ters ou t on a time scale of abou t a minute or so. 

And we were very  lucky a t the  time, 1976, with SAS-3,  that we could do research on these X-ray 
bursts and within a year or two , we discovered eight more o f these burst sources. 

And it is  large ly through  that work--

that observa tional work that  took place--

and through  the work, theoretical work by Pro fessor Paul Joss, who is s till a t MIT--

that we now know wha t causes these X-ray bursts . 

They are nuclear bomb explosions on the surface o f neutron stars. 

What happens  is that on the sur face of the neutron s tar , the matter tha t accretes--

which is  large ly hydrogen and helium from the donor--

becomes very ho t, it becomes very dense, and a t tha t high tempera ture and at very h igh

densities, you get thermonuclear fus ion.


And a reaction tha t can  take place is tha t three helium nuclei--


helium-4--


fuse to form carbon-12 , and when tha t happens, energy is released,  thermonuclear energy  is

released.


This reac tion is extreme ly sensitive to  temperature.


When energy  is released,  the tempera ture goes up .


When the temperature goes up , the reac tion rate goes up, then the tempera ture goes up , then

the reaction ra te goes up even fur ther, and  the whole  thing gets ou t o f hand and that's why  it is a

thermonuclear explosion .


We call it a thermonuclear flash , so it is an uncon trolled , runaway process .


And the bomb explosion that occurs on the sur face of the neu tron star would be a billion  times a 
billion--

a billion times a billion , ten to the 18 times more powerful than hydrogen bombs that we can make 
here on Earth . 

We specu lated early on  that when you see an X-ray burst in the sky,  that you may be ab le to see 
also an op tical flash in the sky. 

The donor s tars and the accretion disk emit optical ligh t.


It's very fain t, there are very faint sources, bu t you can see them  from the ground with your op tical

telescopes .


And we had reasons to believe tha t we might see an optical flash when an X-ray burst occurs,

and I'll te ll you why we believed tha t was the case.


If you have here a neutron star and here you have the accretion disk, and if the bomb explosion

occurs--


these red w iggles are the X rays--


then the s tuff tha t goes s traigh t to  the Ear th you w ill see.


Bu t there are other X rays which go in th is direction, and the heat o f the disk...


we call it X-ray hea ting .


And the d isk loca lly would ge t a temperature o f maybe 30,000 , 40,000 degrees and brigh tens  in

optical.


So we expected  tha t we shou ld see  that e ffect, tha t e ffect o f X-ray hea ting .


Bu t our goa l was even more amb itious.


You see,  the optical ligh t tha t comes from here must be delayed than the X rays that go stra igh t

to the Earth , because firs t the X rays travel in  this direction, and then the op tical light goes  in this

direction .


So if  I pu t my pencil here, th is is the ex tra path tha t the electromagne tic radia tion is going, and

that  takes time .


And if tha t takes one second, then tha t means this distance is one light-second .


If it takes 20 seconds, th is dis tance is 20 ligh t-seconds.


So our goal was to actually measure, for  the firs t time,  the dimensions o f the inner part in the

accretion disk.


And so we organized a worldwide campa ign in 1977 .


17 coun tries were contributing, 44 observa tories , and we to ld them that we were going  to look a t

a par ticular star  in the sky, a very fain t s tar, which was this X-ray binary system.


We would record w ith SAS-3 the X-ray burst, and we wanted them  to record--


in the radio , in the in frared , wherever possible , in the optical--


whether they would see a change in the appearance, in the op tical or  in the rad io appearance .


In the summer o f 1977, we saw 110 bursts from a particular burst source .


None o f them were seen in the op tical or  in the rad io--


zero results .


We d id it again in 1978 and then we succeeded .


This was in collabora tion with Josh Gr indley from Harvard, Je ffrey McClin tock, who was my ex-

graduate studen t--


he is now also at Harvard--


and my good friend Jan van Paradis from the Un iversity in Amsterdam, who worked with me at

the time here at MIT.


This was a splashing resu lt--


simultaneous observa tion o f an optica l flash with an X-ray flash--


and it was on  the cover shee t of Na ture, wh ich is a very prestigious  journa l in wh ich people

publish , so we were extremely happy .


I do wan t to show you the simultaneous even ts but no t the 1978 even t, bu t I'll show you one that

is more impressive that my colleague Ho lger Pedersen observed a year  later, when he did the

optical work from Chile .


This  is that observa tory tha t I mentioned to you earlier.


I have been there many times myself.


It's  in La Silla , 2 ,400 me ters above the ground .


This  is where  the atmospher ic pressure is only three-quarters o f an a tmosphere , and where you

can't boil a so ft-boiled egg because the temperature o f boiling wa ter  is on ly 92 degrees.


Okay, here is the optical flash tha t Ho lger observed, and we were looking with the Japanese

satellite , which was called Hakucho .


SAS-3  I think was no longer opera ting a t the time .


You see here the time o f the op tical signal, so th is is the strength o f the system in quiescence and

then the X-ray burst occurs, and we see here clear ly an optical flash, and here you see the X rays

from Hakucho .


They look very similar, bu t now comes the interesting part.


Of course, I have scaled them up here on the view-graph so tha t they have the same height.


That's  jus t ar tificial, of course.


Bu t now comes the in teres ting part.


If I overlay them, then look a t the blue line , which is the optical--


it's clearly delayed rela tive to the X rays, and that was our goa l.


And th is was really a very clean observa tion, cleaner than our 1978 observa tions , and if you

move the op tical back--


or the X-ray forward , whichever you want--


by abou t two seconds , then they a lmos t exactly overlap .


And so this was conclusive evidence that the dimensions of the disk, of  the accretion disk around

these neu tron s tars, had typ ical dimension o f abou t two ligh t-seconds , o f tha t order.


We suspec ted tha t, for other reasons , but never theless , this was the conclusive evidence.


The bad news  is that during my past term that I was  lec turing 8 .01,  I have been able to do no thing

but 8.01--


no research at all.


And I think you have a ll the righ t to feel guilty abou t this .


[class laughs]


Very guilty .


Now, the good news is that I en joyed it, and whether you like it or no t, you were on my mind

almos t a ll the  time, day and night.


I had even n igh tmares about it, and a typica l n ightmare tha t I would have is the following .


I would come in to 26 .100 , but I los t my  lecture no tes and I couldn't find them and I was

comple tely  ill-prepared , but I wou ld s tart my lectures anyhow, and you would star t laughing at me 
and I would wake up in sweat. 

I don't think we need Freud to exp lain that dream.


Now, I have enormously enjoyed lec turing 8 .01 , and in a way, you have touched my  life and I

trust that I, too , have touched your  life .


Now, I make myself no illusions .


I am sure tha t you will very soon forget Kepler's Third Law, although I hope it won' t be be fore

Monday , when we have the final.


[class laughs]


And you will probably also forget how  to properly apply the conserva tion o f angular momentum.


Bu t perhaps you will always remember from my  lec tures tha t physics can be very exciting and

beautifu l and it's everywhere around us, all  the time , if only you have learned to see it and

appreciate the beau ty.


And surely, when you go on your firs t monkey hun t, wearing your own safari hat, or when you will 
orbit the Ear th and you want to  throw a ham sandwich  to your friend, you may be th inking o f me . 

And I hope those will be happy memories . 

I wish all o f you the very best, and I thank you for a ttending my  lectures. 

[class applauds ] 

LEWIN: Thank you .
