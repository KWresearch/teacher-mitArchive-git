Transcript â€“ Lecture 13 

All righ t...


long weekend ahead o f us.


One more lec ture to go .


If I have an objec t, mass m, in gravita tiona l fie ld, gravitational force is in this direction , if th is is my

increasing va lue of y,  then th is force, vector ially written , equa ls minus mg y roof.


Since this is a one-dimens ional prob lem, we w ill o ften s imply write F equals minus mg .


This minus sign is  important because  that's the increasing value o f y .


If th is level here is y equals zero,  then I could call  this gravitational po ten tia l energy zero .


And th is is y...


Then the gravita tiona l potentia l energy here equals plus mg y.


This  is u .


So if  I make a p lot o f the gravitationa l po ten tia l energy as a func tion o f y , then I wou ld get a

straigh t line .


This  is zero .


So th is equals u ...


equals mg y, plus sign .


If I'm here at point A and I move that object to po int B, I, Walter Lewin , move it, I have to do

positive work.


Notice that the grav ita tional potential energy  increases.


If I do positive work, the grav ity  is doing nega tive work.


If I go from A  to some o ther poin t--


call it B prime--


then I do nega tive work.


Notice the gravita tional potential energy goes down .


If I do nega tive work,  then gravity is doing pos itive work .


I cou ld have chosen my zero po int o f po ten tia l energy anywhere I p lease . 

I cou ld have chosen it righ t here and noth ing would change o ther than tha t I offset  the zero po int 
of my potential energy . 

Bu t again , if I go from A  to B, the gravitational po ten tial energy increases by exactly the same 
amoun t--


I have to do exactly the same work.


So you are free to choose , when you are near Earth , where you choose your zero .


Now we take  the situation whereby we are no t so close to the Ear th .


Here is the Earth itself.


Of course you can also replace that by the sun if you want to .


And th is is  increasing va lue of r.


The distance be tween here and this objec t m equa ls r.


I now know  that  there is a gravita tiona l force on this object--


Newton's Universal Law o f Gravity--


and tha t gravita tional force equals minus m M-Ear th G divided by this r squared, r roo f so this  is a

vectorial no tation .


Since it is really one-dimensiona l, we would...


Just like we did  there , we wou ld dele te the arrow and we would dele te the unit vector  in the

positive r d irection and so we wou ld simply write it this way.


The gravita tional po tential energy we derived las t time equals minus m M-Earth G d ivided by r--


and no tice , here is r and here is r squared--


and if you p lot  that, then the plo t goes sor t of like this.


This  is r,  this  is increas ing potential energy--


all these values here are nega tive--


and you ge t a curve which is sor t o f like th is.


This  is propor tional to one over r.


Now, of course, if the Earth had a radius which is th is big, then , of course,  this curve does no t

exist, it s tops r ight here .


If I move from poin t A to point B, with a mass m in my hand, no tice tha t the gravita tiona l poten tia l

energy increases .


I have to do positive work , there is no difference .


If I go from A  to another poin t, B prime , which is closer to the Ear th, no tice that the grav ita tional

poten tia l energy decreases .


I do negative work .


If I do positive work, gravity is doing negative work.


If I do nega tive work, gravity  is do ing positive work.


Right here near Earth , where th is one-over-r curve h its  the Ear th , tha t is, of course, exac tly tha t

line.


That dependence on y is exactly the same as the dependence on r and then you can simplify

matters when you are near Ear th.


When the gravita tiona l acceleration doesn't change you get a linear re lation.


Bu t tha t's on ly an excep tiona l case when you don' t move very far.


The gravita tional force is  in the direc tion opposite  the increasing po ten tia l energy.


Notice that when I'm here , the gravitational  force is  in this direc tion .


Increasing po ten tial energy  is th is way .


The force is in this way.


When I'm here, gravitational po ten tia l energy increases in th is way ; the gravitational  force is  in

this direction.


When I'm here, the grav ita tional potential energy  increases in this direc tion .


The gravita tional force is  in this direc tion .


When I'm here, the grav ita tional potential energy  increases in this direc tion .


The gravita tional force is  in this direc tion .


The force is a lways in the opposite direc tion than the increasing value o f the po ten tia l energy.


If I release an ob ject at zero speed , it therefore will always move towards a lower poten tia l energy

because the force will drive it to lower po ten tial energy.


Now I change from grav ity to a spring .


I have a spring which is relaxed length l--


I call this x equals zero--


and I ex tend it over a dis tance x and  there's a mass m at the end and  there will be a spring force .


And that spring force...


F equals minus kx.


It's a one-dimensional situation so I can write it withou t having to worry about  the arrows.


There is no  friction here.


It's clear tha t if I ho ld this  in my hand, that the force Walter Lewin equa ls plus kx.


It's  in the direc tion o f increasing x.


If I call  this poin t A at x equals zero and I call th is po int B at x equals x , then I can calcu late  the

work tha t I have to do to br ing it from A to B.


So the work tha t Walter Lewin has to do  to br ing it from A  to B is the in tegral in go ing from A to B 
of my force , dx . 

It's a dot produc t, bu t since the angle be tween the two is zero degrees, the cosine o f the angle is 
one, so I can forge t about  the fac t tha t there's a dot product.


I move it in  this direction.


So tha t becomes the in tegral in go ing from zero  to a position x o f plus x plus kx dx , and tha t is

one-half k x squared.


And th is is wha t we call the po ten tial energy o f the spring.


This  is po ten tial energy.


It means,  then , tha t we ...


At x equals zero, we de fine po ten tial energy to be zero .


You don' t have to do tha t, bu t it wou ld be ridiculous to do it any o ther way.


So in the case that we have the near-Ear th situa tion o f gravity, we had a choice where we put our

zero po tential energy .


In the case tha t we deal with very  large dis tances, we do no t have a choice anymore .


We de fined it in such a way that the potential energy at in finity  is zero .


As a result of that, all po tential energies are negative .


And here , w ith the spr ing, you don' t have a choice , either.


You choose ...


at x equa ls zero , you choose po ten tial energy to be zero.


So if you now make a plot of  the potential energy as a function o f x , you ge t a parabola , and if you

are here , if the object is here , then the force is a lways in the d irection opposing  the increasing

poten tia l energy.


If you go this way, po ten tia l energy increases.


So it's clear that the force is go ing to be in th is d irection .


If you are here, the force is a lways in the direction opposing increas ing potential energy .


Increasing po ten tial energy  is  in th is direc tion , so the force is in this direction .


You see, it's a restoring force .


The force is a lways in the direc tion opposite to increasing po ten tial energy.


If you release an objec t here a t zero speed, it w ill therefore go towards lower potential energy.


The force will drive it to lower po ten tial energy .


If we know the force--


in this case , the spring force or  in those cases , the grav ita tiona l force--


we were able  to ca lcula te the po ten tial energy .


Now, the ques tion is , can we also go back? Suppose we knew the po ten tia l energy.


Can we then find the force aga in? And the answer  is yes, we can .


Let's take the situa tion o f the spring firs t.


We have  tha t the potential energy u of the spring equals plus one-half k x squared and if  I take

the deriva tive of that versus x then I get plus kx, bu t the force , the spring force itself, is minus kx ,

so th is equals minus the spring force .


So we have tha t du/dx equals minus F, and I pu t the x there because it's a one-dimensiona l

problem--


it is on ly in the x direc tion .


The minus sign is te lling you  that  the force is always po inting in the direc tion which is opposite to

increasing va lues of the potential energy.


That is wha t the minus sign is telling you.


It's staring you in the face wha t I have been te lling you for the pas t five minu tes.


If we have a three-dimensional situa tion that we know the po ten tial energy as a func tion o f x , y

and z,  then we can go back and find the forces as a function of x, y and z .


It doesn' t ma tter whe ther these are springs or whe ther  it is gravity or whe ther  it's elec tric forces or

nuclear forces, you then find  that du /dx equals minus F of x, du /dy equals minus Fy and du/dz

equals minus Fz.


What does th is mean? It means tha t if you're in three-dimensional space, you move on ly in  the x

direction .


You keep y and z constan t, and the change equals minus Fx.


That gives you the component of  the force in the x direction .


You move only in the y d irection, you keep x and z constant, and then you  find the component o f

the force in the y direction .


We call these partial deriva tives, so we don't give  them a "d" bu t we give them a little curled de lta .


If we go back to the situation where we had gravity ,  we had there the situation near Ear th . 

We had u ... was p lus mg y, so what is du/dy? This  is a one-dimensiona l situa tion so I don' t have 
to use  the partial deriva tives. 

I can simply say du /dy. 

That is plus mg , and no tice tha t the gravita tiona l force was minus mg . 

Remember? The minus sign is still there . 

It's still there . 

And so you see that here , indeed , du /dy is minus the gravita tiona l force. 

Now we take  the situation tha t we are no t near Ear th--

we have there--

so we have u equals minus m M-Earth G d ivided by r--

there's only an r here--

so du/dr... 

The derivative o f one over r  is minus one over r squared. 

The minus sign ea ts up this minus s ign, so I ge t p lus m M-Ear th G d ivided by r squared so the

gravita tiona l force...


the gravitational force equals minus that.


It is minus du /dr and , indeed , tha t's exactly wha t we have there--


minus that value .


So whenever you know the po ten tial as a func tion of space, you can always find the  three

components of the forces  in the three orthogonal direc tions.


Suppose  I have a curved surface--


litera lly, a surface here in 26 .100 , which sor t of looks  like th is...


something like this.


I call this , arb itrarily, y equals zero and I cou ld ca ll th is u gravitational po ten tial energy zero , for

that ma tter .


So th is is a func tion y as a func tion o f x and the curve itself represents e ffec tively the gravita tional

poten tia l energy.


This  is y and this  is x.


So the gravita tiona l potential energy u equals mg y, bu t y is a func tion o f x , so that is also u times

m...


excuse me , that is m times g times that function o f x.


There are poin ts here where du /dx equals zero.


I'll ge t a nice mg in here...


Where's zero ...


and where are those poin ts? Those poin ts are here, here, here, here and here .


If du /dx is zero , it means tha t the force--


the componen t o f the  force in the x d irection--


is zero, because du /dx  is minus the force in the x direction.


So if we visit those poin ts, for instance here , then  there is, o f course , gravity , mg , if there is an

object there in the y d irection...


in the minus y direc tion and there is a normal force in the plus y direction and these  two exactly 
cancel each o ther. 

So the ne t result is that here , here, here , here and there there is no force on  the objec t a t all so 
the objec t is no t going to move , it's going  to s tay put.


Well, yes , it's going to s tay put.


However, there is a huge difference between this point here and  tha t po int  there and you sense

immedia tely that difference.


If I pu t a marble here , I will have a hell o f a time to keep the marble in place, because if there is a

fly there in the corner o f 26.100 which does some thing  then the slightest amoun t o f force on th is

one and it will start to roll o ff.


In fact, wha t w ill happen is  it w ill go to a lower po ten tial energy.


Here, however , if this one is offse t, then it will want to go to a lower po ten tial energy.


The force is a lways opposing the d irection of increasing po ten tial energy , so  the force will drive it

back and so tha t's why we call th is a stable equilibrium.


It will a lways go back to that po int.


And th is is an unstable equ ilibrium.


We have a setup here, and I wou ld like to show you how that will work .


So we do have some thing  that is a curved ob ject.


It's a track.


Let me give you a little b it be tter  light condition.


So you see  there , there is tha t objec t, a little ba ll.


And no surprise, if I offset it from the lowes t poin t tha t it will be driven back to that po int--


that's tr ivial.


What is  less trivial is that there is a poin t here whereby , indeed, the net forces are zero and it is

not easy to achieve that, but I will try to put it there so that it, indeed, stays put.


I'm no t too fortunate , it is very difficult.


I'm trying... no ...


Yeah ! Did it.


It's there , it's very uns table.


I b low...


oh, it's no t so unstable .


And there it goes .


So you see , that's the difference between stab le equilibrium and unstable equ ilibrium.


At  the s table poin t, the second der ivative o f the po ten tial energy versus x  is positive.


At  the unstable poin t,  the second derivative is negative .


I'm going to return now  to my spring and I'm going  to show you that if you use the po ten tia l

energy o f the spring alone tha t you can show that an object tha t oscilla tes on a spring follows a

simple harmon ic motion . 

So here...


is u as a function o f x, and th is is the parabola that we already had which equals one-ha lf kx

squared.


Let the ob ject be at a position x maximum here.


It's going  to oscilla te between plus x max and minus x max.


When it is at a random position x, there is a force on it and the force is always  in the direc tion

opposing the increasing po tential energy so the force is clearly  in th is direc tion .


It's being driven back to equ ilibr ium.


When it is there , it will have a cer tain velocity.


The ve locity could either be in this d irection or  it cou ld be in that direc tion .


It has a cer tain speed and since spring forces are conservative forces , I can now app ly the

conservation o f mechan ical energy.


We call this a potential well.


The objec t is going to oscilla te in a potential well.


Of course, it doesn't oscillate like  that.


It really oscillates  like this, o f course .


It's a one-dimensional problem.


The to tal energy that I star ted with if I release it here at zero speed equa ls one-half k x max

squared.


That is e to tal.


That will always be the same if there is no fric tion o f any kind and I have to assume tha t there is

no fr iction.


That must be , now, one-half m v squared a t a random position x , p lus one-half k x squared, which

is the po ten tia l energy a t position x.


So th is is the kinetic energy and this is the potential energy.


v is the firs t derivative o f position versus time, so I can write for th is an x dot.


And now wha t I'm go ing to do , I'm going to rewrite it slightly differently .


I'll bring the x do t squared to one side , my halfs go away and I divide by m, so I get plus k over m

times x squared , and then  I ge t minus k x max squared equa ls zero .


Did I do tha t right? Yes,  I d ivide ...


Oh, there's an m here, and the m has to be here .


And now wha t I'm go ing to do , I'm going to  take the time deriva tive of  this equa tion .


Now you will see someth ing remarkable fa lling in place.


Just for free .


I take the deriva tive versus time.


That gives me a  two x do t, bu t I have to app ly the chain rule so I also get x double do t,  the

second deriva tive--


it's the accelera tion--


plus I ge t a two k over m times x , w ith the chain rule gives me an x dot.


This  is a constant, tha t's the to tal energy when I s tarted , so the whole th ing equals zero .


I lose my two , I lose my x do t because it's zero and what do I find? x doub le dot plus k over m

equals zero .


And th is makes my day because I know this  is a simple harmonic oscilla tion .


You've seen th is equation before.


We der ived it in a differen t way.


We d idn't use forces today.


We on ly used  the concept o f mechanical energy , wh ich is conserved .


We know the so lution to this equa tion ...


There is an x here.


I heard someone men tion  the x--


thank you very much .


The so lution is: x equals x max times the cosine omega t plus phi.


This  is the amp litude .


And omega equa ls the square root o f k over m, and the period  for one oscilla tion equa ls two pi

divided by omega.


We were ab le to do th is.


We were ab le to apply the conserva tion o f mechanical energy because spring forces are

conservative forces .


So you've seen, in a comp letely d ifferen t way, how you arrive a t the same result.


Now I'm going to try some thing similar to ano ther poten tial well and tha t potential well is a track

and the track  is a per fect circle .


And I'm going  to slide down that track an objec t mass m, and  I'm going to evalua te the oscilla tion

along a perfec t circular track.


And to make it as perfec t as I can , I even have here a pair o f compasses...


make it a ...


that's the track.


And the track has a radius R, and a t this moment in time the angle equa ls the ta, and here is the

object.


I call this x equals zero .


That is also , o f course, where theta equals zero .


This  is increasing va lue of y, and  I choose  this y equals zero.


And so the gravitational po ten tial energy o f this object is its own mg y , so I have to know wha t this

y is, and therefore  I have to know what this d istance is .


That's very easy .


This one here equals R cosine the ta and so this one is R minus R cosine  the ta.


So the po ten tia l energy equals mg times R one minus cosine the ta, if I choose zero  there .


I'm free to change that bu t tha t's, of course , a logical th ing to do here.


Notice if  the ta equals zero and the cosine theta equals one, then you find u equals zero .


That's , o f course...


I have de fined it.


That's the way I de fined my y equals zero .


So u equals zero.


Notice that when theta equals pi over two--


if the object were here--


that you find tha t the po ten tia l energy u equals mg R.


That's exactly righ t, because then the distance be tween here and the y zero is R , so this is the

poten tia l energy as a func tion o f angle theta .


The ve locity o f tha t object as a func tion o f the ta is given by R d theta /d t.


And I can make you see tha t very easily.


Let this be the angle d the ta so it moves in a short amount of time over an angle d theta and the

arc here is dS, and the radius  is R.


The definition of  the ta--


that's the definition of  theta wh ich is in radians--


is that dS d ivided by R equals d the ta.


That's our definition o f rad ians.


So I take  the deriva tive,  the time deriva tive , left and r ight, so I ge t the dS/d t--


which, of course , is the tangential velocity a long that arc--


equals R  times d theta/d t,  for wh ich you can write R  the ta dot.


d theta /d t... d theta /d t is sometimes called omega, which is the angular ve locity, but keep in mind

that in  this case  the angular velocity omega--


if you want to call this omega , wh ich is the angular velocity--


is changing w ith  time.


The angular velocity  is zero when you release it and is a maximum when it goes through the

lowest poin t.


So I can now apply the conserva tion o f mechan ical energy, because I know what the velocity  is at

any ang le o f theta and I know wha t the kine tic ...


what the po ten tia l energy is .


So , let the total energy be just the mechan ical energy which depends on my  initia l cond itions 
wherever I start. 

Maybe it's  jus t tha t I re lease it here with zero speed; maybe I g ive it a little speed . 

It is a number, it is a constan t. 

So tha t is going to be one-half mv squared at a random angle o f the ta . 

And that means this  is v , so  tha t is R squared times the ta dot squared . 

This  is simply one-ha lf mv squared , nothing else , so  this is the kine tic energy.


Plus the po ten tia l energy, which is mg  times R times one minus cos ine the ta .


And th is is always the same , independen t o f the ang le of the ta , because grav ity  is a conserva tive

force.


So th is is the conserva tion o f mechan ical energy.


This angle cosine theta is really a pain in the neck, and therefore wha t we're going to do is

something we have seen before--


we are going to make a sma ll angle approximation...


small ang le approximation .


And we're going  to wr ite for cosine the ta one minus the ta squared divided by two .


That is a very , very good approxima tion.


That approx ima tion is way better than the one we did before when we simply said the cosine of

theta equals one .


Remember we did that once? We said , "Oh... for the ta is very sma ll.


The cosine of theta is abou t one." If we did tha t now , we would be dead in the wa ters, because if

we said the cosine o f theta is one , this becomes zero and you end up with nonsense , because it

would say that the mechanical energy  is changing all the time because this velocity is changing

all the time . 

So we cannot do  that. 

We would kill ourselves  if we did  that. 

The approximation is really amazingly good . 

If I give you here theta in radians and I g ive you here  the cosine of  the ta and here I give you one

minus theta squared over two, then if I take 1 /60 o f a radian--


and I p ick 1 /60 since tha t is approximate ly one degree.


Bu t I p ick exac tly 1 /60--


and I ask wha t the cosine is,  that is 0.999.


And then I have an 861114 .


I just used my calcula tor.


Then I calcula te wha t one minus the ta squared over two is and I find 0.999861111.


That is very, very close .


That is only ... it only differs by three par ts in a billion . That is very c lose.


That means the difference be tween the two is only one-third of a millionth o f a percen t.


Suppose now  I go a little rougher and I go to one-fifth o f a radian, which is abou t 12 degrees, so

this  is very roughly 12 degrees .


Then the cosine o f the ta equals 0 .98007 , and one minus the ta squared over two equa ls 0 .98000.


So tha t still is amazing ly close--


that is , only d iffers by seven parts  in 100 ,000 , so the difference is less than 1/100 of a percent.


So with this  in mind,  I feel comfor table to pursue my conservation o f mechan ical energy.


And I'm going  to replace th is cosine  theta by one minus the ta squared divided by two .


So I will con tinue here--


the center blackboard is always nice , you can see it best--


and I w ill massage tha t equa tion a little further and, o f course, you can already guess wha t I am

going to do when I massage it a little fur ther.


I'm going to take  the time deriva tive just as I did in  the case of  the spring .


So we are go ing to ge t tha t the mechanica l energy--


which is no t changing--


equals one-half m R squared the ta do t squared plus mg R.


Cosine squared becomes one minus theta squared over two so we have a minus times minus

becomes plus so I get simply the ta squared over two .


And now I take the time deriva tive ...


for this becomes zero ...


equals...


Now, I ge t a two out o f here , which ea ts up  this one-half, so I get m R squared , then I get theta

dot, bu t the chain ru le g ives me the ta doub le dot.


Excuse me? Anyth ing wrong? I don' t th ink so , thank you.


So I have to  take the deriva tive of  this one.


The two flips out, which eats up this two , so I ge t mg R and then I ge t a the ta.


With the chain rule , g ives me a the ta dot.


I lose my m, I lose one R , I lose my theta dot--


I p icked the wrong one ; I lose my theta do t, no t the theta--


and what do I find? Tha t the ta doub le dot plus g over R times theta equals zero .


And I couldn't be happ ier, because this tells me tha t the mo tion is that o f a simple harmon ic

oscillation .


And the solution is x...


excuse me , no t x .


Theta equals some maximum angle for theta .


It's the amplitude in angle times the cosine of omega t plus ph i.


This  is the angle of frequency.


It has nothing , noth ing to do with tha t omega there , which is the angu lar ve locity , which is

changing in time .


This  is a constant, this  is angular  frequency and th is omega equa ls the square root o f g over R,

and so the per iod of the oscilla tion is two pi times the square roo t of R over g .


And when you see tha t, you say, "Hey! I have seen that before." Where have we seen th is

before?

Almost a carbon copy o f some thing tha t we have seen before .


What is  it?


[class murmurs]


LEW IN : Excuse me , speak louder.


[echoing class ]: Pendulum! We had a pendulum whereby we had leng th l of a massless string.


We had an ob ject m hanging on the end and wha t was  it doing? It was going along a perfec t arc

which is exactly identical.


The problem is the same, it's no t a surprise , because now we have a sur face which is an exac t,

perfect arc.


It's a circle , we have no friction .


We assumed with the pendulum tha t there was no fric tion either .


So it shou ldn't surprise us tha t you ge t exactly the same period tha t you had with the pendulum

and...


except tha t, o f course with the pendulum, what we called l is now R .


Gravity  is the only force that does work and so it is justified to use the conserva tion o f mechanical 
energy because gravity  is a conservative force. 

We used  the small angle approxima tion to make it work.


In the case of the spring, we had that the potential energy was proportional to x squared and ou t

came a perfec t simple harmon ic oscillation ,  no approximation necessary.


Now we forced this potential energy ...


we forced it in to being dependen t on the ta squared .


That's really wha t we d id.


You see,  tha t is the term o f the po ten tial energy that you have there.


And by the approxima tion o f cosine the ta being one minus theta squared over two, we forced this

term to become quadratic in  theta and there fore now , w ith tha t approxima tion it becomes a

perfect simple harmonic oscillation.


Now comes a key question.


I said, "Gravity is really the only force tha t does work." Is tha t true? There's no friction for now .


Is that rea lly true? When we had  the pendu lum, it's true there is gravity.


That's clear .


There's a gravita tiona l force, which is mg, bu t there is a lso tension .


We never men tioned  tha t.


We d idn't even talk abou t it when we did the conserva tion o f mechan ical energy .


When the object is here, sure,  there is grav ity and sure, there is no fric tion .


So there is no force along the arc, bu t there must be a normal  force.


Is the tension not doing any work? Is the norma l force not doing any work? Did we, perhaps,

forge t some thing? Remember  las t week, I pu t my  life on the line .


I was so convinced tha t the conserva tion o f mechan ical energy was going to work tha t I almos t

killed myself--


not quite--


with th is huge, 15Î©  kilogram pendulum tha t I was sw inging.


I be lieved in  the conservation o f mechanical energy and I overlooked the tension .


Is it possible that the tension does, perhaps , positive work? If tha t's the case, I could have died.

What is the answer?  Is the tension doing any work and in the case o f my circular track is ,

perhaps, the norma l force doing any work? Wha t is the answer?


[class murmurs]


LEW IN : I want to hear it loud and clear ! CLASS: No .


LEW IN : No ! Why  is it no? Why  is it no t do ing any work? Because what?


[student answers ]


Exactly . You got it, man! That's  it.


The force is a lways perpendicu lar to the direc tion o f mo tion .


And since work is a dot product between force and the direction  tha t it travels , neither the tension

nor the norma l force does any work .


So don' t overlook the force , but do appreciate  the fac t that they don' t do any work .


Great! So now I'm going to show you a demons tration which I find one o f the most mind-boggling

demons trations tha t I have ever seen.


We do have a circular track.


You have it right in fron t of you .


That is a circle, although you may not th ink  it is, bu t it is .


And that circle has a rad ius wh ich, according  to the manufacturer, is 115 me ters w ith an

uncertain ty of abou t...


I think  it's about five me ters.


It is extremely difficu lt to measure and even during transport, you th ink it could change .


Let me  try to clean this a little be tter.


And so the radius o f this ... the radius o f curva ture of our arc, which is a lso an a ir track, equals 115

plus or minus five meters .


So we can calcu late now what the period of oscillations  is.


The whole track  is five meters  long .


So half the track  is abou t 2Î© meters, so  the angle  the ta max imum is approxima tely 2Î© me ters--


which is half the length o f the track--


divided by 115 and tha t is an ex tremely small angle .


That is abou t 1.2 degrees, because th is is  in radians and th is is  in degrees.


So the angle is very small, so we should be able to make a perfec t prediction abou t the period.


And I am going to do  tha t.


I take two pi times the square root o f R over G and R is 115 , 115...


I d ivide it by G.


I take the square roo t, I multiply by two .


I multip ly by pi and I ge t 21.5 .


T--


and this  is a pred iction...


equals 21.5 .


The uncerta inty  in R  is about 4 .3%.


Since we have the square roo t of R, that becomes 2.2%.


So if  I multiply that by .022, I ge t an uncerta inty of abou t 0 .47 .


Let's ca ll this 0 .5 seconds.


So th is is a hard prediction wha t the period o f an oscilla tion should be--


21.5 plus or minus a half second.


Now I'm going to observe it and we're going to see wha t we're go ing to ...


how this compares.


I don't wan t to ... I don' t want to oscillate it ten  times.


That will take three, four, five minu tes--


that's too long .


It is not really necessary because my reaction time is 0.1 second , so even if I d id only one

oscillation , tha t would be enough  to see whether  it is co inciden t w ith that...


consisten t with that number .


However, it is such a beautiful exper iment.


It's so much fun  to see tha t ob ject go back and for th in 21 seconds , tha t I will go ...


For your pleasure and for my own pleasure , I will go  three oscillations.


Not tha t it is necessary, but  I w ill do it.


3T is going to be some thing plus or minus ...


and this  is my reaction time, which is 0.1 second, and then we can all divide tha t by three and

then , o f course, the error will go down by a fac tor of three, and we w ill see whe ther this number

agrees with th is one.


All righ t, can you imagine someone making a track  like  this...


air track with a rad ius o f 115 me ters? I mean , what is th is? Th is may be eigh t me ters.


115 me ters! Tha t is some thing like  ten times higher...


more--


15 times higher than this ce iling.


Amazing that peop le were able to do that.


In fact, nowadays, you can' t even buy this anymore.


This  is probably some 50 years o ld, if not older.


I have to get the air flow ing out o f a ll these ho les.


There are many , many sma ll holes  in here that you cannot see.


The air is now blowing .


And th is ob ject is going  to be put on here and just because of gravity, it w ill go .


That's all it is--


only gravity w ill do work.


Here's the timer and we're going to  time it.


I will star t it off firs t and then when it comes back to a s top, I will start to  time because tha t's, for

me, a very sharp criterion .


When the object comes back and comes to a ha lt here , it's very easy for me to star t the timing.


You may no tice , as you wa tch, that some o f the amplitude will decrease because there is ...


hold it, hold it, hold it! Because there is , of course, a little bit o f fric tion .


It's very little, bu t it is no t zero .


Enjoy this, jus t look a t it.


Isn't th is incredible? It jus t goes simply by gravity .


It's  like a pendulum which has a leng th of 115 meters.


It's abou t to comple te its firs t oscilla tion .


It goes back...


Actually, some of you may be able to see the curvature .


You can really see tha t it is not stra igh t.


So we're coming up to the second .


I be tter get back  in position.


So when it s tops here, it has made three complete oscillations.


Sixty- four poin t zero five .


Let me  turn this off.


So 3T equa ls 64 .05 .


I'm lazy--


64.05 , I divide  that by three.


That is 21 .35, plus or minus .03 .


That's exactly in agreement with the pred iction, with the uncertain ty o f the predic tion .


I have some thing very similar, and that is , again , a curved track.


It's not...


Oop, I hope I can re trieve that ball.


It would be nice .


Hmm, wha t happened? Boy ! You have  to be...


Gee, wha t's happen ing here? Oh , yeah, I go t it, got it, got it.


Phew ! Tricky to make a hole in here .


This  is an arc, no t unlike this one.


There's more , a little bit more fric tion and, in th is case , the radius is 85 centime ters.


So we can calcu late what the maximum angle is .


The radius  is 85 cen timeters and  the arc to the edge is about 20 centimeters .


So we have now a situa tion like this.


R equa ls 85 cen timeters and this here is approx ima tely 20 centime ters, so the ta maximum is

roughly 20 d ivided by 85 and tha t is some thing like 13 degrees.


13 degrees is no t a bad situa tion because the d ifference be tween the cosine the ta and one minus 
theta squared over two is less than 1/100 o f a percent, it is tha t small. 

So I can make a predic tion o f the period o f this oscillation, predic t and you can go through exactly 
the same exercise .


You take  two pi times the square roo t of R over d and you find 1.85.


The uncerta inty of  this radius  is, of course , not very large bu t we are no t certain about  the radius

to abou t one cen time ter, so it's 85 plus or minus one centimeters.


So tha t's abou t a 1 .2 percent error and so the error, then, in the predic tion will be 0.6 percen t; it's

about .01 seconds.


So I expect...


this  is my prediction.


Now, I really wan t to challenge th is .01 and so now I'm going to make the observa tions and surely

I'm going to do it now 10 times, because then the uncer tain ty w ill be 0.1 seconds--


that's my reac tion time--


and so I have the fina l period to an accuracy o f .01 seconds and so we can compare these

numbers direc tly and tha t is wha t I will do now.


I have here  the timer and I'm going to oscilla te tha t back and for th--


and tha t would only take 20 seconds--


zero it, we s tarted here.


We have grea t confidence in physics, righ t? We believe in physics.


We be lieve in the conserva tion o f mechanical energy .


Starts... are you coun ting? Is this two? Yeah? Is this three? Four? CLASS: Four.


LEW IN : I don't believe you.


Okay, we s tart aga in.


Now! One , two , three , four , five , six , seven...


I'm ge tting nervous.


Eigh t, n ine,  ten .


Holy smoke! 22 .7 seconds! It should have been 18 ! 22.7 seconds.


There mus t be some thing  fundamen tally wrong with the conservation of mechanica l energy.


Or is there some thing else? And wha t is the difference between the two experiments? STUDENT:

Friction.


LEW IN : Excuse me? STUDENT: Fric tion .


LEW IN : Oh, no , the fr iction is so low,  that is no t the reason.


There's a huge d ifference .


Think abou t it when you take your shower this weekend.


There is a huge difference be tween th is ob ject moving and tha t ob ject moving and when you find

out,  that is the reason why tha t is way slower , not fr iction.


See you next Wednesday.
