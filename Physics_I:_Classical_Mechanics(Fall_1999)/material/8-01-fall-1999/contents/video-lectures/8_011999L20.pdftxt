8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 20 

We're now en tering the part o f 8.01 wh ich is the mos t d ifficult  for s tuden ts and faculty alike .


We are going to en ter the domain o f angular momentum and torques.


It is extremely nonintu itive .


The good news, however, is tha t we w ill stay with this concept for a t least four or five lectures .


Today I will in troduce bo th torque and angular momentum.


What is angular momen tum? If an object has a mass m and it has a velocity v , then clearly  it has

a momentum p.


That's very we ll defined in your re ference frame , the product of m and v .


Angu lar momen tum I can  take re lative to any poin t I choose.


I choose  this poin t Q arbitrar ily.


This now  is the position vector , wh ich I ca ll r o f Q.


Let this ang le be the ta .


And angu lar momen tum re lative to tha t poin t Q--


it's a vector--


is the pos ition vec tor re lative to tha t poin t Q cross p.


So it is r o f Q cross v , and then times m.


The magnitude of the angular momentum, re lative to point Q, is, of course, rmv, bu t then I have to

take the sine o f the angle the ta, so let's say  it is mv r sine theta and this I o ften call, shorthand

nota tion , r perpendicular . 

That r perpend icular  is this distance, rela tive to po int C .


What you just saw may have con fused you and for good reason , because I changed my index

"Q" to "C," and there is no C .


The indexes should all be Q, of course .


So th is r  is the leng th of  this vec tor.


It is the magnitude o f this vector . 

So th is shou ld have a "Q." And r o f Q sine the ta , which I call r perpendicular , mus t have an index

Q, and that is this par t here.


This angle is 90 degrees and th is here is r o f Q perpendicular.


No Cs a t all, only Qs--


I'm sorry for tha t.


The direction of the angular momentum is easy.


You know how to do a cross produc t.


So in th is case , r cross v wou ld be perpend icular to the blackboard and the magnitude is also

easy to calculate .


Now comes the difficult prob lem with angu lar momen tum.


If I chose any poin t on this  line , say po int C , then the angular momen tum re lative to poin t C is

zero.


Very obvious, because the position vector , r , and the velocity vector , in this case, are in the same

direction .


So the ta is zero , so the sine of  theta is zero .


So you immed iately see  that angular momen tum is not an in trinsic proper ty o f a moving ob ject,

unlike momen tum, wh ich is an in trinsic property .


If you s it there in 26.100, you see an object moving with a cer tain velocity , it has a cer tain mass,

you know  its momentum.


What the angular momentum is depends on the poin t that you choose, on your poin t o f origin .


If you had chosen this point D,  then the angular momentum would even be this way , because

when you pu t here the position vector in  there you see r cross v is now coming out o f the

blackboard.


And th is is why angular momen tum is such a difficult concept.


Bu t we will massage it in a way that it w ill be very use fu l.


Suppose  I throw up an objec t in 26.100 and a t time t equals zero , the objec t is here and a t time t,

the objec t is there.


So th is, then, is the position vector a t time t.


The objec t starts off w ith a certa in ve locity v and a little  later , here, say, the velocity  is  like so .


And there is , of course, a force on it, mg, which makes this curve .


What is the angular momen tum rela tive to poin t C a t time zero? The angu lar momen tum is clearly

zero, because the point itself, the mass itself, is at point C.


So the position vec tor has no length , so it's clear tha t it's zero.


What is the angular momen tum at time t when the ob ject is here? We ll,  that angular momentum is 
clearly no t zero, because you see here position vec tor and you see the velocity , so clearly the 
angular momentum was changing . 

Now you will say , "Of course it was changing--

big deal." Because angu lar momen tum has a velocity vector in it. 

And here the velocity vector  is changing all the time, so , obv iously, you would say the angular

momen tum is changing.


Well, yes , tha t is no t a bad argument, but I will now show you a case where the ve locity  is

changing all  the time , but where angu lar momen tum is not changing.


I choose  the Earth going around the Sun .


Here's the Ear th, with mass m.


At po int C here is the Sun.


This  is the position vector r o f C and the Earth has a certain tangen tial velocity and the speed

never changes , but  the ve locity does change.


So th is is the pos ition vec tor a t a later po int in time.


What now  is the angular momen tum of the Ear th going around the Sun, relative  to poin t C?  I p ick

C now .


Well, tha t angular momentum...


If I take the magnitude o f the angu lar momen tum, because the d irection is immedia tely obvious...


If the object is going around like this--


this  is the position vector--


then the d irection w ill be poin ting ou t of the b lackboard .


That's easy.


So I'm only worried now abou t the magnitude .


So the magn itude is the mass of the Ear th times the magnitude of the cross product be tween

these two vectors .


And no tice the ang le is 90 degrees.


So I can forge t abou t the cross, the sine o f the ta is one, and so I simp ly ge t mrv , v now being  the

speed.


This  is the case when the objec t is here , but when the object is here, the situa tion has no t 
changed. 

Again, r cross v , the magnitude , is exac tly the same, because the sine o f the angle hasn't 
changed. 

And so you see here a case whereby the velocity is changing all  the time bu t your angular

momen tum rela tive to poin t C  is not chang ing .


Suppose  I had chosen poin t Q.


Is angular momen tum changing re lative to poin t Q? You'd be tter be lieve it.


There is a time tha t the objec t w ill go through poin t Q.


Well, then the angular momentum is clearly zero because the position vec tor  is zero .


If the object is here and you take the angular momentum re lative to poin t Q,  for sure the angular

momen tum is no t zero .


You have a position vector and you have a velocity .


So only rela tive to point C--


it's a very spec ial case now--


is angu lar momen tum not changing.


So angular momen tum is conserved in th is specia l case, but only about poin t C.


And I wan t to address tha t in a little bit more general way.


I take the angular momen tum and I choose a poin t Q, and I know that  the definition is position

vector relative  to poin t Q cross p .


I take the deriva tive , time deriva tive dL /dt rela tive to tha t po int Q.


It's always  important that you sta te which poin t you have chosen rela tive to which you take  the

angular momentum.


That is going to be dr/d t...


excuse me--


cross p plus r o f Q cross dp /dt.


This  is the way tha t you  take the time der ivative o f a cross product.


We calcu late the angu lar momen tum relative  to poin t Q.


So the index has to be Q throughout  the equa tion .


The position vector , relative  to poin t Q.


And in th is equation , you see the correct index Q here.


You see the correct index Q here , but  I slipped up here and I pu t a "C" there .


There is no "C" in this problem, so this  is also r of Q.


Sorry for tha t.


This, here , is the velocity o f the object, the velocity vec tor, wh ich is always in the same direc tion

as p.


So th is is zero.


dp/d t--


that is , the force on the objec t--


we've seen that be fore in 8.01.


And so now we have  tha t dL /d t, rela tive to a point Q, equals the position vector r from tha t poin t

cross F.


And th is, now , is wha t we ca ll torque.


And we write  for tha t the symbol tau ... it is a vec tor.


And I pu t in tha t Q again .


And th is is one o f the most important equa tions tha t will stay with us for a t least five lectures .


What this is telling you is that if there is a torque on an object, the angu lar momen tum mus t be

changing in time .


If there is no torque on the ob ject, angular momentum will be conserved.


And now you get some insigh t into this situation tha t we jus t d iscussed.


The force , the attractive force, gravita tiona l force exerted on the Ear th is in  this direction.


The position vector  is in this direc tion , so r cross F is zero.


There is no  torque rela tive to this poin t C , because the angle between the two vectors  is 180

degrees and so the sine o f the angle is zero .


Therefore, no matter where you are on the circle, always r cross F will be zero .


There is no  torque rela tive to point C.


Bu t if you take poin t Q or you take here some poin t A, c learly, there is go ing to be a torque, a

changing torque even, and so there you will have a change o f angular momentum.


So there's someth ing very specia l about  tha t po int C and I will come back to that, o f course.


Now I wan t to expand the idea o f angular momentum from one poin t objec t tha t moves  in space

to an object like a sphere or  like a d isk which is rota ting abou t its center o f mass.


And I will s tart with a d isk.


Here we have a disk.


The disk has mass M and the disk has rad ius R , and at th is po int C  is the center o f mass of this

disk.


It's rota ting with angu lar ve locity omega and I wan t to know wha t the angular momentum is o f th is

rotating disk.


The direction of the angular momentum is going to be trivial.


If it's ro tating like th is...


If you take here a little mass e lemen t, mass m o f i, this is the position vector r of i, re lative to tha t

point C , and here you have the ve locity , v o f i.


And you see immed iate ly tha t r cross v is coming ou t o f the blackboard so  tha t's easy.


Angu lar momen tum w ill be in th is direc tion , but wha t is the magnitude of  the disk as a whole?

Well, let's firs t calcu late what the angular momentum is of this  little mass e lement about th is po int.


So L o f C for mass elemen t i equals ...


Oh, le t's jus t only worry about magnitude because already we know the direc tion .


So tha t is m of i and then the cross product between r o f i and v of i.


Bu t this angle is 90 degrees so I can forge t abou t the sine o f the ta.


So I simply get r o f i, v of i.


r of i rela tive to that point C times v o f i--


this  is the magnitude .


Now, I ha te to see v o f i in a rota ting d isk because  the velocity will depend on how far you are

away from the cen ter .


The ve locity here is zero.


However, they all have omega in common.


Every single elemen t tha t you choose has the same omega .


So I'm always going to rep lace--


in a case like this--


v by omega R .


And so this then becomes m o f i, r of i of C .


I ge t a square here and I get omega .


So I wrote down v equa ls omega R , which, o f course , holds in general.


It would have been better, perhaps, if I had wr itten down v o f i equals omega times r o f i, because

each element little "i" , which has a position vec tor r of i, has a velocity which is given by v of i 
equals omega r o f i. 

Bu t I condensed that, sor t of, in one equa tion--

v equals omega R.


Bu t this  is the connec tion that will make it, perhaps , easier for you to understand wha t fo llows .


So tha t is the angu lar momen tum for this  little mass elemen t.


Bu t now I want to know wha t the en tire angu lar momen tum is abou t tha t poin t C as an axis going

through the center of  the mass , through the center o f the disk perpend icular to the b lackboard .


And now , o f course, I have to do the summa tion o f a ll these elements  i.


I can bring the omega outs ide, and I would have , then , the summa tion o f m of i r o f i re lative to

that po int C squared .


And you see immed iate ly--


I hope tha t you see immedia tely--


that  this  is the moment of inertia for a spin around the center of mass for tha t poin t C .


And so I can write for this, I o f C  times omega.


Now comes the ques tion--


so th is is the magn itude--


now comes the ques tion , is this angular momen tum different, for  instance , for this poin t A? And

your firs t reaction will be, "Yeah , o f course, because it depends on the point you choose." We ll,

the remarkab le thing is tha t if you have a ro tation abou t the cen ter of mass which  I have chosen

here, then even if you ca lcula te the angu lar momen tum rela tive to this poin t--

or any other po int, even this poin t in space--

you will a lways find the same answer . 

Bu t on ly in case that there is a rota tion about  the center of mass, and we call that the spin angular 
momen tum. 

The sp in angular momentum is an intr insic property of an object regardless of wh ich po int you 
choose rela tive to wh ich you calculate  the angular momen tum. 

So in the case that an objec t is spinning abou t its cen ter of mass, you no longer have to specify 
the poin t tha t you have chosen , your poin t o f origin .


You can really ta lk now about the angular momentum.


The Ear th is spinning about its cen ter of mass, so  the Earth has an in trinsic spin angu lar

momen tum.


In addition , it has an orbital angular momen tum.


If you want  to talk abou t the orb ita l angular momentum of the Earth , however , you'd be tter do it

relative to tha t poin t, o therwise it wou ld be changing in  time. 

It's only uniquely defined if you take  this special poin t, because on ly about that point, which is the 
location o f the Sun , is the angular momentum--

the orbital angular momen tum o f the Earth--


not changing.


I'm going to do a daredevil experiment with you and tha t is called ice-ska ter's deligh t.


You will see that it is no t a deligh t at all.


Bu t in any case, it is de fin ite ly a fun experiment.


I have here a turntab le--


very little  friction--


and I'm go ing to rotate the turn table about the center and I'm going to stand on  that  turntable and

I will hold in my hand two weights , these two .


They're each about 1 .8 k ilograms.


So these we ights m, 1.8 kilograms...


My en tire mass--


including  the turn table and my body, le t's say--


is abou t 75 kilograms.


And I'm going  to ask someone to give me a little  twist to rotate me abou t this axis o f symmetry .


Rota te me , say , if you look from below , let's say I'm be ing ro tated clockwise .


So we have here a situa tion of a rotation abou t the center of mass so we can talk abou t the

intrinsic angu lar momen tum of th is ro tating system.


And the angular momentum vector will obviously be pointing upwards.


That's clear .


If you rota te clockwise from below ...


Remember , here you were rotating counterclockwise; it was coming ou t of  the blackboard .


Here you rota te clockwise , it will be going up.


So far , so good.


There is a force on me due to gravity--


mg, no concern .


There is an equally strong  force, normal force up , and the two cance l each o ther ou t.


Once I have been given a cer tain ro tation , a certa in angular velocity I'm going to pull my arms in

and pu ll my arms ou t and pull my arms in, and when  I do that, tha t does not cause a net torque

on the system. 

I can keep doing tha t all the time and there is no ne t torque.


And so angular momentum as we have specified for a spinning object mus t be conserved, canno t

change.


L equa ls I omega.


Bu t as I pull my arms  in , my momen t of iner tia will go down.


And if my momen t of iner tia goes down , then if this product has to rema in cons tan t, my angular

velocity mus t go up.


And vice versa , so when I pull my arms in , I will go faster and when I do  this, I will go slower.


And I wan t to be a little bit quan titative w ith you .


I simplify my own body by a geome tric objec t for which  I can calculate the momen t of iner tia

which is a cylinder .


I may not look like a cylinder , but close enough for all practical purposes.


And th is cylinder has a radius o f about 20 cen timeters--


not too bad , it sort o f fits me--


and I'm go ing to rotate this cylinder around th is axis and I can calcula te now wha t the moment o f

inertia is .


The cylinder has a mass o f 75 kilograms, has a rad ius of 20 cen time ters, and so the moment o f

inertia--


in the s itua tion tha t, for ins tance I have these two objects nex t to my body here or I have them like

here, so this  is my shor thand nota tion--


equals simp le one-half M R squared .


Remember , tha t was the momen t of iner tia--


we discussed that las t time--


of a ro tating disk which ro ta tes abou t the line o f symme try.


And so, if I put in the numbers here , the 75 kilograms , and I take a radius of 20 centime ters,  then

I found  that  this  is about 1 .5 in our mks un its .


Bu t now I'm go ing to pu t my arms  like th is and now the momen t o f inertia will go up .


And I'll make a very crude calcula tion how much it goes up.


My arm leng th is about 90 cen timeters.


The weigh ts here are 1 .8 k ilogram.


So I just assume tha t my arms have no weight for simplicity, that all the weight is  in these two

objects .


It's a simplification, bu t you will see it's a drama tic change and  that's all I want you to see .


So now the momen t o f inertia, when my arms are like this.


Of course, there's my body, which is the 1 .5.


That is still there bu t now there is an additional component: one from  this mass , wh ich is M R

squared, and one from this mass, which is M R squared, where this  is now tha t radius r.


And so I get twice tha t mass and then I have to take R squared, which is 0.9 squared , and I have

to take the 1 .8 , because tha t's the moment of inertia o f this objec t about  this poin t.


It is M R squared,  I assume that my arm has no mass.


And when you add th is up , you'll find 4.5 in mks un its , k ilograms meters squared .


And now you see, if I go from this situation to th is, my momen t o f inertia goes down by a factor of

three and if my momen t o f iner tia goes down by a  factor of three, my angular velocity must go up

by a factor o f three .


And vice versa .


I want to do  this experiment bu t th is experimen t is not withou t danger .


The problem with this experimen t is that  the momen t that you pu ll your arms  in you ge t

immedia tely extreme ly d izzy and you can lose your balance and you can fa ll fla t out on the floor.


And I have jus t talked this morn ing with some student here who did  that in high school and he told

me tha t, indeed , one of the teachers wen t fla t down and I' ll try not to do  that  today .


So I need really assis tance from someone whom I can  trust.


Do you th ink I can  trust you? Not you .


[class laughs]


LEW IN : That's an hones t answer.


You're a s trong man--


can I trust you? The first thing I wan t you to do is to he lp me get on here , because even ge tting

on here is not easy .


If I jus t s tep on here,  I w ill probab ly fall.


Okay, so stand there , put your arm around my neck.


Suppor t me strongly, yeah , okay.


All righ t,  there we go.


Now, s tay with me for a while , okay, jus t s tay there .


All righ t, now you give me a reasonable angu lar ve locity, wha tever you think is reasonab le. 

I'll te ll you if it's comple tely unreasonable .


[class laughs]


LEW IN : Give me a push,  tha t's fine .


Wow... is  it  fine? Now , you wa lk a little bit away .


If I fall, try to ca tch me.


[class laughs]


LEW IN : Okay, my arms go in now .


My arms go out.


My arms go in.


My arms go out.


Okay, now I'm complete ly dizzy now.


This  is no joke , so stop me , yeah? Jus t hold it.


[class laughs]


LEW IN : No , just hold me , hold me.


Okay, get my hand.


Okay... okay, you passed the course .


[class laughs]


[class applauds ]


Whew! Sacrifice for the sake of science .


[groans theatrica lly]


All righ t,  I've done worse.


If we have a collection of many poin ts--


like we earlier d iscussed with momentum--


points that in teract with each other...


They cou ld be s tars who gravita tionally  interact.


They cou ld be objects which are connec ted with springs.


They have internal interactions which go on all the time .


They bounce off each o ther , they collide,  they break up in pieces , internal friction , anything.


Then if  I take two o f these objec ts, if this one , for  instance, is a ttrac ted towards this one,  then

action equa ls minus reaction and these two forces are identica l in magn itude.


So if  I take any poin t Q here , no ma tter where you choose it, tha t will never pu t a torque on that

system because the two forces cancel each other ou t.


And so now we ge t the fina l conserva tion o f angular momen tum in a ll its glory  if on ly we add ,

here, one little word--


"external." The angular momentum o f a system... This was angu lar momen tum o f just one ob ject;

this  is the angular momen tum o f a system of many particles.


They cou ld be connected with springs .


There could be chemical explosions go ing on.


They cou ld plow  in to each o ther .


They cou ld break each o ther up .


The angular momentum will not change if there is no net ex terna l torque on that system, because

all the in ternal  torques cancel out because ac tion equa ls minus reac tion .


So if we now compare conservation o f angular momen tum with conserva tion o f momen tum, then

in the case o f the conserva tion of momen tum, remember, when we have a system of objec ts, in

the absence of an external force on the system as a whole, the net external force , momen tum

was conserved.


Now we have ...


with a system o f particles in  the absence of a ne t ex ternal torque , angular momen tum is

conserved.


In the case of the ice-ska ter's de ligh t, when you pu ll your arms  in , the moment o f inertia goes

down and so your frequency goes up .


When a s tar shrinks , its radius goes down , its momen t of inertia goes down, and there fore its

angular velocity must go up .


Momen t o f inertia goes w ith R squared .


What de termines the size of a star? If th is is a s tar,  then inside this star  is a  furnace , nuc lear

furnace .


Nuclear fusion is going on .


That produces hea t and pressure, which wan ts to expand the s tar.


On the other hand,  there is grav ity , wh ich says, "Sorry, you can't do  that.


I want to ho ld you toge ther ." In fact, gravity wou ld like to collapse the star .


And na ture finds a balance between the gravity and this pressure due to the nuclear furnace .


Now, there comes a  time tha t the nuclear furnace has been complete ly consumed .


For our Sun , tha t takes an additiona l five billion years.


The Sun has already been burning nuclear fuel for five billion years .


It has ano ther five billion to go.


And once the nuc lear fuel has been consumed , there are three end-products o f the dead star that

is le ft over.


And these three end-products are the fo llowing: Number one is called a white dwarf.


It has a rad ius approximately the same as the Ear th, some 10,000 k ilometers, and the mass o f a

white dwar f...


There's a who le range of them, but a typ ical number, say, is half the mass o f the Sun .


So tha t's one possible end-product.


This w ill be the fate o f our Sun , by the way.


The density o f such an object is qu ite high--


some ten  to the rho--


will be roughly ten  to the 6 th grams per cubic cen time ter.


Ano ther possibility  is tha t you end up w ith a neu tron s tar.


A neutron s tar has a radius o f about  ten kilometers, and it has a mass o f roughly 1 .5 times the

mass o f the Sun , and its density is abou t ten to the 14 grams per cub ic cen timeter, which is even

higher than  the density o f nuclei.


And then there is a possibility, wh ich is even more b izarre, tha t you end up with a b lack ho le.


I will not  talk abou t b lack ho les today bu t I will ge t back to tha t later in 8 .01 .


And a black hole , for all practical purposes, has no size at all.


The mass of the b lack ho le mus t be larger than we think--


three solar masses--


and so the density  is  infinitely high .


Whether you end up to be a white dwarf, a neutron s tar or a black hole depends on the mass o f

the progenitor--


of the star that collapsed when the fuel, when the nuc lear fuel was gone.


And in order to form a neu tron s tar, you would have to start off with a star o f probably at least ten

solar masses, maybe even more .


So our Sun will not become a neu tron s tar, bu t our Sun will ultima tely become a wh ite dwar f.


Now, it wou ld be a reasonable ques tion to ask, Why do you end up only w ith  these three 
possibilities? Why  is there no thing in be tween? Look, there is a huge difference from 10 ,000 
kilome ters to ten kilometers . 

Is there nothing in be tween? And the answer to tha t lies in quan tum mechan ics, which is not part 
of this course but you will see that in 8 .05.


Why are there only these two? And  then if you ge t into general rela tivity, then you will understand

why there is , then, th is third , very bizarre possibility .


When a s tar collapses,  two things happen .


First of all, there is a huge amoun t of gravitational po tential energy that is released in the form of

kinetic energy .


The s tu ff fa lls  in--


we call it gravita tional collapse .


And that gravitational po ten tial energy conver ts to kinetic energy and that ultima tely converts to

heat and to rad iation.


If I take an ob ject here , a p iece o f chalk, and  I drop tha t, tha t you can call gravitational collapse.


Gravita tional potential energy  is conver ted to kine tic energy and , u ltima tely , it goes to heat.


Here we're ta lking abou t a s tar which is imploding , collapsing, and the amounts of gravita tiona l

poten tia l energy tha t become available are enormous .


In addition to this huge amoun t of energy release , the s tar must spin up , because its moment o f

inertia goes down and there fore the angular velocity must go up .


I want to do a little bit o f quan titative work on this .


And I wan t to take an ob ject like our Sun and I would like to collapse tha t objec t from its present

radius--


of the Sun , wh ich is about 700 ,000 kilome ters--


I want to collapse tha t to a neu tron s tar with a radius o f ten k ilometers, even though I know and I

told you tha t the Sun will not become a neutron star.


It's  just to get some feeling for the numbers.


So we take an objec t like the Sun , wh ich has a radius o f about 700 ,000 kilometers , and we're

going to collapse tha t to a neutron s tar which has a radius of about ten kilometers .


The mass of the Sun is two  times ten to  the 30 kilograms, and for those of you who are good at 
math, they can calculate--

when you collapse this object without los ing any mass, you keep all  the mass , bu t you shr ink it to 
ten k ilometers--

how much gravitational po ten tial energy  is re leased? And that is a s tagger ing number, and  I call 
that de lta u . 

It is a loss o f gravita tional potential energy which is about ten to the 46 joules.


And th is number is truly mind-boggling.


This  is conver ted to kine tic energy and then it is conver ted to hea t and all forms of radiation.


To g ive you a feeling  for how absurdly  large th is number is, if you take the Sun and you take all

the energy tha t the Sun produces  in its ten billion years tha t it will live , the to tal energy ou tpu t of

the Sun is a hundred  times less than th is number , and this comes ou t in a ma tter o f seconds. 

So it is a mind-boggling idea  that  the Sun is produc ing in ten b illion years, the life time of the 
Sun ... 

It is producing less energy than what happens during a stellar collapse to a neutron star. 

Hundred times  less. 

So , when this  in- fall occurs and this huge amoun t of energy is re leased , the ou ter  layer bounces

off the inner core and is expe lled and that's wha t we call a supernova explosion.


The outer  layers are thrown o ff with speeds typica lly some 10,000 k ilometers per second .


Our Sun will no t become a neutron star, bu t it will become a wh ite dwar f.


We talked about the Crab Nebula last  time, and  the Crab Nebula is a remnan t of a supernova

explosion which occurred--


believe it or no t--


on the Four th of July  in the year 1054 .


Talking about fireworks.


The supernova explosion was no ticed by Chinese astronomers .


They called th is a gues t s tar.


Chinese astronomers were very prestigious .


The reason for tha t was tha t these Chinese as tronomers advised the emperor .


They looked at the sky and they derived from  the sky  in formation tha t was key for the emperor .


They knew how  to interpret the occurrence o f come ts or, for instance , shooting stars, or a

particular  line-up of planets and certa inly the appearance of a gues t s tar.


And they wou ld know tha t,  for instance , a come t in a certain part o f the sky migh t mean tha t there

would be hunger or there would be d iseases, there would be famine , or  it would be a good time

for a ba ttle or it would be a bad time for a ba ttle.


And that's wha t these peop le were do ing .


They were adv ising the emperor and therefore they were keeping a very close eye on the sky.


No pun implied.


This s tar was visib le for weeks during the day when it exploded , and it was the brigh tes t s tar in

the sky for years to come .


It is a comple te puzzle why there isn' t a sing le report by any European astronomer on the

occurrence of  the supernova of 1054.


It is very puzzling.


Now, you can argue tha t in the Ne therlands and in England there are always clouds, it's a lways

raining , so you can't see the sky--


okay, I grant you that.


Bu t then we have Italy , and we have Spain and we have France .


And it is very strange .


It must have been a cultural thing.


Somehow  in the 11th cen tury, somehow , Europe was not interested in look ing at the sky.


This  is something they cou ld not have missed, bu t they didn' t write it down .


I now want to pursue  the sp in-up of  this s tar when it collapses from 700 ,000 kilome ters to ten

kilome ters.


If we round the numbers o ff a little b it, then  the reduction in radius  is abou t 100,000.


It's really only 70 ,000 , but le t's jus t make  that 100,000, ten to the 5th.


That means R square goes down by a fac tor of ten b illion.


And if R square goes down by a factor o f ten billion , then the momen t of iner tia goes down by a

factor o f ten billion , and so omega must go up by a factor of  ten billion .


If you s tar ted off w ith a star that rotated about its own axis in a hundred days, it ends up ro tating

around in one millisecond when it has become a neu tron star .


A neutron s tar, ten kilometers .


It has abou t the same mass as the Sun, a little more .


And it spins around in one millisecond .


At  the equa tor o f the neutron star, you reach about 20% of  the speed of light.


We know o f hundreds of neu tron stars  in the sky.


Two o f them have , in fact, rota tional periods o f 1 .5 milliseconds--


many of them much s lower--


and we discussed las t time why tha t is .


Because remember, in the case o f the Crab Pu lsar, the pulsars s low down .


Nature is tapp ing on the ro tational kine tic energy of these pulsars and is conver ting it into o ther

forms of energy--


in the case o f the Crab Pulsar, radio emission, op tical emission , gamma rays, X rays and even

jets.


The Crab Pulsar was slowing down every day 36.4 nanoseconds, which led to a staggering

power ou tpu t.


I s till remember the number .


I think six times ten to the 31 watts.


In 75 years , the pulsar slows down by one millisecond , so the 33 milliseconds would become 34

milliseconds  in 75 years.


If the s tar has an orig inal...


There's no s tar, that was a d isk, r ight? If the s tar has an original magne tic fie ld which mos t s tars

do--


oh, I lost my s tar, bu t tha t's okay--


then in the collapse the magne tic fields will become stronger.


And th is is someth ing you w ill learn about in 8 .02, why  it becomes stronger.


So mos t of these neutron stars have strong magnetic fields and most ro tate very fas t.


And for reasons that we don' t quite understand, many o f them blink at us .


They b link at us  in radio emission .


We be lieve that there are two beams o f radio emission  like a lighthouse going ou t from the two

magne tic poles o f the neu tron s tar , and as the neutron star ro tates and you are on Ear th , if it 
sweeps over you you see radio emission , radio emission, you see no thing. 

You see radio emission , you see radio emission .


So many pu lsars whose beam doesn' t sweep over  the Earth we wou ld never be ab le to see , o f

course.


And in the case o f the pulsar  in the Crab it is even more special, because that pulsar also blinks

at us  in the optical, in  the X rays and in the gamma rays.


And so now I would like  to show you some slides and d iscuss in a little bit more de tail  the

supernova exp losions and the fabulous ligh t outpu t and the spin-up, so I have to make it quite

dark... make it complete ly dark .


There we go.


And so the first s lide is simp ly an ar tist's conception--


don't take  this too seriously--


of these beams of radio emission .


This  is, then, the ro ta ting neu tron star , and if the axis o f rota tion doesn't coincide with the

magne tic dipo le axis, and if you have these radio beams--


which we do no t understand how they are formed--


there you can see , when they rotate how  they can sweep over you.


Now you may say, "We ll,  that's a little b it artific ial, "because why would  the axis o f rota tion be

differen t from  the magnetic d ipole axis?" Well, that is not an excep tion a t all in astronomy .


The Ear th itse lf has a magnetic dipole axis which does not co incide with the axis of ro tation .


In fact, almost all the planets  in our plane tary system  have a magnetic d ipole axis which makes a

large angle with the axis of rotation, so tha t's the rule in astronomy , ra ther than the excep tion ,

even though it may no t be easy to understand  that.


And these b lue lines , then , represen t magnetic field lines.


You will see more of them than you like when you take 8.02 .


And here is Joce lyn Bell.


Jocelyn Bell was a gradua te s tuden t under Anthony Hewish in Cambridge, England, and she

discovered pu lsars.


She found in the radio data--


which were ob tained using a new telescope tha t An thony Hewish had built--


she found in there per iodic signals--


pulses, if you wan t to call them--


you see some o f them here at the bottom, and they were 1.3 seconds apar t.


And she reported tha t to Anthony, and Anthony said, "Well, they've got  to be nonsense, o f

course. 

"I mean , there's no t an ob ject in the sky " tha t is going to give us pulses w ith a separa tion o f 1 .3 
seconds." So they jus t assumed  that it was caused by an elevator , by maybe milking cow 
machines or th ings o f tha t na ture, motorcycles... and so they d id every conceivab le thing to check 
whether , indeed , th is was a man-made phenomenon . 

Bu t they could no t find any thing , and it was Jocelyn , through her incredible brilliance , who was 
able to convince Anthony tha t indeed this  is an object that is in the sky and that the radia tion 
doesn't come from  the Ear th . 

And when they rea lized that, they realized tha t this wou ld be the discovery o f not only the cen tury 
but of all o f mank ind, because they sa id, "We ll, who could possibly send rad io beams a t us "and 
modulate  them w ith a period o f 1 .3 seconds? On ly in telligen t life can do that." And so they called 
this firs t ob ject "Little Green Man." Bu t just be fore they published--

they discovered it in 1967 , by the way--

they found a second pulsar which had a sligh tly different frequency than the 1 .3 second period , 
and so then they realized ~tha t it was probab ly  not in te lligen t life but that it was an astronomical 
object. 

So they gave that second object the name "Little Green Man II," but they abandoned tha t idea

very quickly.


Now comes the sad part o f the story.


In 1974, Anthony Hewish was awarded the Nobe l Prize for  this discovery.


And Jocelyn , who more than deserved it, who rea lly was the discoverer , who was the person who

proved that  this was as tronomical, did no t share in the Nobel Prize .


It is upsetting , it is sad.


I have d iscussed it w ith Jocelyn several times--


I know her quite well--


and she takes it actua lly very  ligh tly , too lightly , I th ink.


Still, people  feel unhappy about it and s till, a fter so many years--


the Nobel Prize was awarded in 1974--


every time that I  think abou t this magnificen t discovery and I think abou t Jocelyn,  I think abou t th is

gross injus tice .


Here we see the Crab Nebu la again , we've seen it be fore.


The red filamen ts tha t you see here are the resu lt of matter  that was blown o ff when the implosion

occurred and when the outer  layers bounced o ff  the inner core.


And originally they had a speed o f abou t 10 ,000 kilome ters per second and by now--


it is about 1 ,000 years later--


these speeds have been reduced somewha t.


Bu t here a t the cen ter you see the pulsar, and las t time I showed you convincing evidence tha t

this  is the pulsar , because it's blinking a t us.


It has a d iameter o f about seven light-years .


It is a d istance from us of abou t 5,000 ligh t-years.


In terms o f angular size in the sky, it's about five arc minutes  in s ize, which is abou t one-sixth o f

the angular diameter of  the Moon.


This  is a drawing, a cave draw ing , made by Navajo Indians, and some people have specula ted to

what extent the Nava jo Ind ians may have seen the supernova in 1054.


It's unclear , but it is a possibility .


The Moon cer tainly ge ts very close to the supernova, but it also ge ts very close to Venus, and so

this  is some thing that is no t we ll estab lished , but it is a possibility.


Here you see a ga laxy in wh ich a supernova occurred , and when the supernova occurs a t its

brightes t, it can be brighter than all hundred b illion s tars in the galaxy.


That's how much energy is released in optica l ligh t.


You see tha t it is at leas t as bright as the en tire galaxy .


From this p icture to this picture is abou t one year.


This occurred in 1972 and over the period o f one year , you can still see  this s tar quite clearly, bu t

it has d iminished in strength qu ite a bit.


And then a grea t th ing happened in February 1987 , on  the 23rd of February.


The supernova wen t o ff in  the Large Magellanic C loud , which is a sa tellite galaxy to our own

galaxy.


It's a d istance o f abou t 150,000 ligh t-years, and there was an astronomer who was observing in 
Sou th America . 

His name is Ian Shelton , and he left the dome to look a t the stars and he decided  to take a pee 
outside . 

And as he was taking a pee--

these were his own words--

he looked a t the Large Mage llan ic Clouds and he said, "Hey, tha t is funny! That star  is not 
supposed to be there ." And he was the d iscoverer o f what is now known as 1987A, an enormous 
supernova go ing off so close  to where we live.


And the next slide shows you the same por tion o f the Large Magellanic Clouds and you can

clearly see that there is a very bright star .


He could see th is with his naked eye.


This  is a pic ture made by the Hubble Space Telescope of supernova 1987A.


The inner ring that you see is the resu lt o f ma tter that was thrown o ff by the s tar before it went

into supernova explosion some 25 ,000 years earlier .


It expelled gas  in its equa tor.


This  is really a circle , a lthough it looks like an ellipse because of  the projec tion effec t.


And th is ring o f ma tter moved ou t w ith a speed of about eigh t k ilometers per second and it has a

radius o f abou t e igh t ligh t-mon ths .


And so e igh t mon ths after the supernova explosion , the ultraviole t ligh t and the X rays from the 
supernova caught up with this ring o f ma tter and they excited it and it became visib le. 

Be fore the supernova explosion , this ring was not visible. 

We are expec ting in a few years tha t the matter  itse lf that was thrown off with a much more 
modes t speed o f abou t 10,000 k ilometers per second ... 

that  tha t ma tter will a lso p low  into this ring and then we expect some real fireworks again . 

There is no explana tion that peop le agree upon for these two called "hourglass" rings. 

They are qu ite mysterious and  there are papers wr itten on it and people disagree on  their origin . 

Supernovae exp losions  in our galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Clouds are quite rare. 

We expec t no more than abou t one in a hundred years. 

The previous one tha t could be seen with the naked eye was  in the year 1604 . 

It's called Kepler supernova . 

And 1987A was really the  first that could be studied with modern equipment--

radio observatories , X-ray observatories  in orbit around the Earth.


With some luck, you may see a supernova explosion naked eye in your  life.


The chance is no be tter than ten percen t, so maybe it will help if occasionally you take a pee

outside and you become as famous as Ian Shelton d id, who is now a very famous man.


See you Monday.
