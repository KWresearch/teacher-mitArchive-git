8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 28 

Today we're going to con tinue with playing w ith liquids . 

If I have an objec t tha t floats , a simple cylinder tha t floa ts in some liqu id, the area is A here, the 
mass o f the cylinder is M. 

The density o f the cylinder  is rho and its  leng th is  l and the sur face area is A. 

So th is is  l. 

And le t the liquid line be here , and the  fluid has a density rho fluid . 

I call this  level y1 , this  level y2. 

The separation is h , and righ t on top here , there is the atmospheric pressure P2 , which is the

same as it is here on  the liqu id.


And here we have a pressure P1 in the liquid .


For this objec t to float we need equ ilibrium be tween , on the one hand,  the force Mg and the

buoyant force.


There is a force up here which  I call F1, and  there is a  force down here which I call F2--


barome tric pressure.


The force is a lways perpendicu lar to the surface.


There couldn' t be any tangen tia l component because  then the air s tarts to flow , and it's sta tic .


And here we have F1 , wh ich con tains the hydrosta tic pressure.


So P1 minus P2--


as we learned las t time from Pascal--


equals rho o f the  fluid g to  the minus y2 minus y1, which is h.


So tha t's the difference between the pressure P1 and P2.


For this to be in equilibrium, F1 minus F2 minus Mg has to be zero, and this we call the buoyan t

force.


And "buoyan t" is spelt in a very s trange way : b-u-o-y-a-n-t.


I a lways have  to think about that.


It's the buoyant force.


F1 equals the area  times P1 and F2 is the area  times P2, so it is the area times P1 minus P2, and 
that is rho fluids times g times h. 

And when you look at  this,  this  is exac tly the weight of  the disp laced fluid .


The area times h is the vo lume o f the  fluid wh ich is disp laced by this cylinder, and you multiply  it

by its density,  that gives it mass.


Multiply  it by g , tha t g ives it weigh t.


So th is is the we igh t o f the disp laced flu ids.


And th is is a very specia l case of a genera l pr inciple wh ich is ca lled Archimedes' principle.


Archimedes' principle is as follows: The buoyan t force on an immersed body has the same

magnitude as the we igh t o f the  fluid wh ich is displaced by the body.


According to legend Archimedes thought about this wh ile he was taking a ba th , and I have a

picture of  that here--


I don't know from when that da tes--


but you see him there in h is ba th , but wha t you a lso see are there are two crowns .


And there is a reason why those crowns are there .


Archimedes  lived in the third cen tury B.C.


Archimedes had been given the task to de termine whe ther a crown tha t was made for King

Hieron II was pure gold .


The problem for him was to determine the density o f th is crown--


which is a very irregu lar-shaped objec t--


withou t destroying it.


And the legend has  it  tha t as Arch imedes was taking a bath , he found  the so lution .


He rushed naked through the s treets o f Syracuse and he shou ted , "Eureka ! Eureka ! Eureka !"

which means , " I found it!  I found it!" Wha t did he find? What did he think of? He had the great

vision to do the follow ing : You take the crown and you weigh it in a normal way.


So the we ight o f the crown--


I call it W1--


is the volume o f the crown times the density o f wh ich it  is made.


If it is gold, it shou ld be 19.3 , I believe, and so th is is the mass o f the crown and this  is the we ight

of the crown .


Now he takes the crown and he immerses  it in wa ter. 

And he has a spring ba lance , and he we ighs  it aga in. 

And he finds tha t the weight is  less and so now we have the we igh t immersed in wa ter. 

So wha t you ge t is the weigh t of the crown minus the buoyant force , which is the weight of  the 
displaced fluid . 

And the we igh t o f the disp laced fluid is the volume of  the crown--

because the crown is where ... 

the water has been removed where the crown is--

times the density o f the  fluid--

which is wa ter, which he knew very well--

times g . 

And so this part here is weight loss. 

That's the loss o f we igh t. 

You can see tha t, you can measure  that with a spr ing . 

It's  lost weight, because of the buoyan t force. 

And so now what he does , he takes W1 and divides that by the weigh t loss and tha t g ives you

this term d ivided by th is term, which immedia tely gives you rho of the crown div ided by rho o f the

water.


And he knows rho o f the wa ter, so he can find rho of  the crown.


It's an amaz ing idea ; he was a genius.


I don't know how the story ended, whe ther  it was gold or not.


It probab ly was , because chances are  that if it hadn't been go ld tha t the king wou ld have killed

him--


for no good reason, bu t tha t's the way these things worked in those days.


This me thod is also used to measure the percen tage o f fa t in persons' bodies , so they immerse

them in wa ter and then they weigh them and they compare that with their regular weigh t.


Let's  look a t an iceberg .


Here is an iceberg .


Here is the wa ter--


it's floa ting in wa ter .


It has mass M, it has a to tal volume V  tota l, and  the density o f the ice is rho ice, which is 0.92 in

grams per cub ic cen timeter.


It's  less than wa ter.


This  is floa ting , and so there's equilibrium between Mg and the buoyan t force .


So Mg must be equa l to the buoyant  force.


Now, Mg is the total vo lume times rho ice times g , just like the crown .


The buoyan t force is the volume underwa ter, wh ich is this par t, times the density o f water , rho

water,  times g .


You lose your g, and so you find that the vo lume underwater divided by the total vo lume equals 
rho ice divided by rho of wa ter, which is 0.92. 

That means 92% of the iceberg is underwa ter, and this explains some thing abou t the tragedy on 
April 15 , 1912 , when the T itanic h it an iceberg .


When you encounter an iceberg, you literally only see the tip of the iceberg .


That's where the expression comes from.


92% is underwa ter .


I want to re turn now to my cylinder, and I wan t to ask myself the ques tion , when does tha t

cylinder floa t? Wha t is the condition  for floa ting? Well, c learly, for that cylinder to float the buoyan t 
force must be Mg, and the buoyan t force is the area times h--

that's the vo lume underwa ter--


multiplied by the density o f the  fluid  times g must be the to tal volume o f the cylinder , which is the

area times l, because tha t was the length o f the cylinder, times the density o f the ob ject itself

times g .


I lose my A, I lose my g, bu t I know tha t h must be less  than l; o therwise it wouldn' t be floating,

right? The par t below  the water has to be smaller than the length o f the cylinder.


And if h is  less than l, tha t means that  the density o f the fluid mus t be larger than the density o f

the objec t, and this  is a necessary cond ition for floating .


And therefore , if an object sinks then the density o f the object is  larger than the density o f the

fluid .


And the amazing thing is that this  is comple tely  independent o f the dimensions o f the objec t.


The only thing tha t ma tters is the density .


If you take a pebble and you  throw  it in the water , it sinks, because the density o f a pebble is

higher than wa ter.


If you take a piece of wood, which has a density lower than wa ter , and you  throw  it on wa ter, it

floa ts independen t o f its shape .


Whether it s inks or whe ther  it floats , the buoyant force is always  iden tical to the weigh t of the

displaced fluid .


And th is brings up one o f my favor ite ques tions that I have for you that I wan t you to th ink about.


And if you have a fu ll understanding now o f Archimedes' principle, you will be able to answer  it, 
so concentrate on wha t I am go ing to presen t you with . 

I am in a sw imming pool, and I'm in a boa t.


Here is the swimming poo l and here is the boat, and I am sitting in the boat and  I have a rock

here in my boat.


I'm sitting in the swimming pool, nice rock  in my boa t.


I mark the wa terline o f the swimming pool very care fully.


I take the rock and I throw  it overboard .


Will the wa terline go up, or will the water line go down , or maybe the wa terline will s tay the same?

Now, use your  in tuition--


don't mind being wrong .


At home you have some time to th ink about it, and  I am sure you will come up with the righ t

answer.


Who thinks that the wa terline will go up the swimming pool? Who th inks that  the waterline will go

down? Who th inks that it will make no d ifference , tha t the wa terline s tays the same?

Amazing--


okay.


Well, the waterline will change , but you figure it ou t.


Okay, you apply Archimedes' principle and you'll ge t the answer .


I want to  talk abou t s tability , particu larly s tability o f ships, which is a very  impor tant  thing--


they float.


Suppose  I have an ob ject here which is floating in water.


Here is the wa terline, and le t here be the cen ter o f mass of that object.


Could be way o ff cen ter.


It could be an iceberg , it could be bou lders, it could be rocks in there , right? It doesn' t have to be

uniform density.


The center of mass cou ld be o ff the center...


of the geome tric cen ter .


So if  this object has a certain mass, then th is is the gravitational  force.


Bu t now look a t the cen ter o f mass fluid that is displaced.


That's clearly more here, somewhere here , the displaced fluid .


That is where the buoyant  force ac ts.


And so now what you have ...


You have a torque on  this objec t relative  to any po int  that you choose .


It doesn' t ma tter where you pick a poin t, you have a torque.


And so what's going to happen , th is ob ject is clearly going to ro ta te in this direc tion .


And the torque will only be zero when  the buoyan t force and the gravita tional force are on one

line.


Then the  torque becomes zero , and then it is complete ly happy .


Now, there are two ways that you can get them on one  line.


We d iscussed that earlier  in a differen t con tex t.


You can either have the center o f mass of the object be low the center o f mass of the d isplaced

fluid or above .


In both cases would they be on one line.


However, in one case, there would be stab le equilibrium.


In the o ther, there would no t be a stable equ ilibrium.


I have here an ob ject which has  its center o f mass very low .


You can't  tell that--


no way of knowing.


All you know  is tha t the weight of  the displaced  fluid  tha t you see here is the same as the weigh t

of the object.


That's all you know .


If I took this objec t and I tilt it a little with the center o f mass very low--


so here is Mg and here is somewhere the wa terline--


so the cen ter of mass o f the displaced flu id is somewhere here , so Fb is here , the buoyan t force ,

you can see what's going to happen .


It's going  to ro ta te towards the r ight--


it's a restoring torque, and so it's comple tely s table.


I can wobb le it back and for th and it is stab le.


If I wou ld turn it over , then it's no t stab le, because now  I would have the cen ter of mass

somewhere here , high up , so now I have Mg.


And the cen ter of the buoyan t force,  the displaced wa ter, is abou t here, so now I have the

buoyant force up , and now you see what's going  to happen.


I tilt it to the side , and it will ro tate even further.


This torque will drive it away from the vertical.


And that's very impor tan t, therefore , with ships, that you always build the ship such tha t the

center of mass o f the ship is as  low as you can ge t it.


That gives you the most stable configura tion .


If you bring the cen ter of mass o f sh ips very high--


in the 17th cen tury,  they had these very massive cannons which were very high on the deck--


then the ship can capsize , and it has happened many times because the cen ter o f mass was  just

too high .


So here... the center o f mass  is somewhere here .


Very heavy, th is par t.


And so now, if I lower  it in  the water no tice it goes in to the wa ter to the same dep th, because the

buoyant force is , o f course, the same , so the amount o f displaced wa ter  is the same in both

cases.


Bu t now the center o f mass  is high and this  is very uns table.


When I le t it go, it flips over .


So the cen ter of mass o f the objec t was higher than  the center o f mass of the d isplaced fluid .


And so w ith ships , you have  to be very carefu l about  that.


Let's talk a little b it abou t balloons.


If I have a balloon,  the situation is no t too dissimilar from having an objec t floa ting in a liquid .


Let the ba lloon have a mass M.


That is the mass o f the gas  in the balloon p lus a ll the rest, and wha t I mean by "all the res t"...


That is the ma terial o f the balloon and the s tring--


everything else that makes up the mass .


It has a cer tain volume v, and so there is a cer tain rho of the gas  inside and  there is rho o f air

outside .


And I wan t to evaluate wha t the criterion is for th is balloon to rise . 

Well, for  it to rise , the buoyant force will have to be larger than Mg . 

What is the buoyant force? Tha t is the weigh t o f the displaced flu id. 

The flu id, in  this case , is a ir. 

So the we ight o f the disp laced flu id is the volume times the density of  the air--


that's the flu id in which it is now--


times g , tha t is the buoyan t force .


That's ... the weight o f the displaced flu id has to be larger than Mg .


Now, Mg is the mass o f the gas , which is the volume of the gas times the density o f the gas .


That's the mass times g--


because we have to conver t it to a force--


plus all the rest, times g.


I lose my g , and wha t you see ...


that  this, o f course, is a lways larger than zero .


There's a lways some mass associa ted with the skin and in th is case with the string.


Bu t you see , the only way tha t this balloon can rise is that the dens ity of the gas must be smaller

than the density of air .


Density of the gas must be less than the density o f the air.


This  is a necessary cond ition for th is to hold .


It is not a sufficien t condition , because I can take a balloon, pu t a little bit o f helium in there--


so the density of  the gas is  lower than the density of air--


but it may not rise, and  tha t's because o f this term.


Bu t it is a necessary condition bu t not a su fficien t condition .


Now I'm going to make you see a demonstra tion which  is extremely non intuitive, and I will try,

step by step, to exp lain to you why you see wha t you see.


What you're going to see, very nonin tuitive, so try to fo llow closely why you see wha t you w ill see.


I have here a pendulum w ith an app le, and here  I have a balloon filled with helium.


I cu t this string and I cu t th is string.


Gravity  is in this direction .


The apple will fall, the balloon will rise.


The balloon goes in the opposite direc tion than the gravitational accelera tion.


If there were no gravity,  this balloon would no t rise and  the apple wou ld not fall.


Do we agree so far? Withou t gravity , apple wou ld not fall, balloon would not rise.


Now we go in ou ter space .


Here is a compar tment and here is an apple.


I'm here as well.


None o f us have we ight, there's no gravity, and here is a helium- filled objec t, a balloon , and

there's a ir inside .


We're in ou ter space,  there's no gravity.


Nothing has any weight.


We're a ll floating.


Now I'm going to accelera te.


I have a rocket--


I'm going to accelera te it in this d irection w ith accelera tion a .


We a ll perceive, now , a perceived gravity  in this d irection.


I call it g.


So the apple will  fall.


I'm standing there,  I see this apple fall.


I'm in this compar tment, closed compartmen t.


I see the apple go down .


A little la ter , the apple w ill be here .


I myself fall; a little la ter , I'm  there.


I can pu t a ba throom scale here and weigh myself on the ba throom scale.


My we igh t will be M times this a , M be ing my mass , a being this accelera tion .


I rea lly think that it is gravity  in this direc tion .


The air wants to  fall, but the balloon wants to go aga ins t gravity.


The balloon w ill rise.


The air wants to  fall, so inside here you crea te a d ifferential pressure be tween the bottom, P1,

and the top o f the air , P2 , inside here .


Just like  the atmosphere on ear th--


the atmosphere is pushing down on us--


the pressure is here higher than there.


So you get P1 is higher than P2 .


So you crea te yourself an a tmosphere , and the balloon will rise .


The balloon goes in the opposite direc tion o f gravity.


If there were no air  in there,  then clearly all o f us would fall: The app le would fa ll, I would fa ll, and

the helium balloon would fall.


The only reason why the helium balloon rises  is because the a ir is there and because you build 
up this d ifferen tia l pressure . 

Now comes my question to you : Instead o f accelera ting it upwards and crea ting perceived gravity 
down, I'm now going to accelerate it in th is direc tion , something that I'm going to do shortly  in the 
classroom. 

I'm going to accelera te all of us  in th is direc tion a .


In which direction will the apple go?  In which direction will the ba lloon go? What do you think?

The apple will go in the direc tion that it perceives gravity.


The apple will go like this .


I will go like th is.


The air wants to go like  this.


Bu t he lium--


balloon--


goes in the opposite direction of gravity, so helium goes in this direc tion .


In fact, wha t you're do ing, you're building here an a tmosphere where pressure P1 here will be

higher than  the pressure P2 there.


The air wants to go in this d irection.


The pressure here is higher than the pressure there--


larger than zero.


If there's no air  in there, we would a ll fall.


Helium would fa ll...

helium balloon would fa ll, apple would  fall, and I would  fall.


I have here an app le on a s tring in a closed compar tment, no t unlike wha t we have there except  I

can't take you out to an area where we have no gravity.


So here is tha t closed compar tment, and here is the apple.


There is gravity  in this direc tion .


It wan ts to fall in tha t direction of gravity if I cut the w ire.


Now I'm going to accelera te it in this d irection, and when I do that, I add a perceived componen t 
of gravity  in the opposite d irection. 

So I add a perceived componen t of gravity in this direction.


So th is app le wants to fall down because o f the gravity that  I cannot avoid , and it wants to fall in

this direction.


So wha t will the str ing do? It's very clear, very intu itive , no one has any problem with tha t--


the s tring will do this .


Now I have a balloon here .


Helium.


There is gravity  in this direc tion .


That's why the balloon wan ts to go up.


It opposes gravity.


I'm going to accelera te the car  in this direc tion .


I introduce perce ived gravity  in th is direction.


What does the balloon want to do? It wan ts to go against gravity.


I bu ild up in here , and it must be a closed compar tment...


I must bu ild up there a pressure differen tia l.


The air wants to  fall in this d irection.


I bu ild up a pressure here wh ich is  larger than the pressure there.


That's why  it has to be a closed compartmen t.


What will the helium ba lloon do? It will go like tha t.


That is very non intuitive.


So I accelera te this car.


As I w ill do , the app le w ill go back, which is comp letely consisten t with all our  in tuition , bu t the

helium balloon w ill go forward.


Let's first do it w ith  the apple , which is to tally consistent with anyone's  intu ition.


I'm going to make sure that the apple is not swing ing too much.


Now, it only happens during the acceleration, so it's only during the very short por tion that I

accelerate that you see the app le go back, and then o f course it starts to swing--


forge t tha t part.


So watch closely--


only the momen t that I accelera te the apple will come this way .


It goes  in the d irection o f the ex tra component o f perceived gravity.


Ready?

Boy, it almost hit this glass here.


Everyone could see tha t, right? Okay .


Now we're going to do it with the ba lloon .


We're go ing to take this one off.


And now  le t's take one of our beau tiful balloons.


We're go ing to pu t a ba lloon in here .


Has to be a closed compartmen t so  that  the air can bu ild up the pressure differential.


There's a lways problems with sta tic charges on these systems .


Okay.


Only as  long as I accelera te will the balloon go in a forward direc tion , so  I accelerate in  this

direction , and wha t you're go ing to see is rea lly very nonintu itive .


Every time I see it, I say to myself, "I can reason it, but do I understand it?" I don' t know , wha t is

the difference be tween reason ing and unders tanding? There we go.


The balloon went this way.


You can do this  in your car with your parents .


It's really fun to do it.


Have a string with an apple or someth ing else and have a helium balloon .


Close the windows.


They don't have to be  tota lly closed, bu t more or  less, and ask your dad or your mom to slam the

brakes.


If you s lam  the brakes, wha t w ill happen? The app le w ill go ...

what do you think?  If you s lam  the brakes, the apple will go forwards, balloon will go backward .


If you accelera te the car a ll of a sudden , the app le w ill go backwards and the balloon will go

forward.


You can do tha t at home .


You can enjoy ... enter tain your paren ts a t Thanksg iving .


They'll ge t some of  their $25 ,000 tu ition back.


[class laughs]


When flu ids are moving , situations are way more complicated than when they are sta tic .


And th is leads to , again , very nonin tuitive behavior o f fluids.


I will derive in a short-cut way a very famous equation which is called Bernoulli's equa tion , which

relates kine tic energy w ith po ten tial energy and pressure.


Suppose  I have a fluid , noncompressible , like so.


This cross-sectional area is A2 and the pressure here is P2 .


And I have a velocity o f tha t liqu id which is v2 and th is level is y2.


Here I have a cross-sectiona l area A1 .


I have a pressure P1 .


My level is y1 ; this  is  increasing y.


And I have a much larger velocity because the cross-section is substan tia lly smaller there .


Now, if this flu id were comple tely sta tic , if it were no t moving--


so forget abou t the v1 and forget abou t the v2 ; it's  just sitting s till--


then P1 minus P2 would be rho g times y2 minus y1 if rho is the density of  the flu id.


That's Pascal's Law.


So it wou ld just be sitting still, and we know tha t the pressure here would be lower than the

pressure there.


This  is also , if you wan t to , rho gh if you call this distance h.


Rho gh--


that reminds me o f mgh, and mgh is grav ita tional poten tial energy .


When I divide m by volume , I get density .


So th is is really a term which is gravita tional potential energy per unit vo lume.


That makes the m div ided by vo lume become dens ity .


Therefore, pressure itse lf must also have the dimens ion of energy per unit volume.


And if we now se t this whole machine in motion , then there are three p layers: There is , on the

one hand, kine tic energy--


of mo tion--


kinetic energy ...

I take it, per unit volume .


There is gravita tiona l potential energy...


I will take it, per unit vo lume.


And then there is pressure.


They're equal par tners.


And if I apply the conserva tion of energy, the sum of these three should remain constan t.


That's the idea behind Bernoulli's  law , Bernoulli's equa tion.


When I take a fluid elemen t and I move it from one position in the tube to another position, it

trades speed for either heigh t or for pressure.


What is the kine tic energy per unit volume? Well, the kinetic energy  is one-half mv squared .


I d ivide by volume, I ge t one-half rho v squared .


What is gravitational po ten tial energy? That is mgy .


I d ivide by volume, and so I get rho gy plus the pressure at  tha t location y , and tha t mus t be a

constant.


And th is, now , is Bernou lli's equa tion .


It is a conserva tion o f energy equation .


And as I will show you, it has very remarkab le consequences.


First I will show you an example whereby I keep y cons tant.


So I have a tube wh ich changes d iameter , but the tube  is no t changing with level y, as I do there .


So I come in here, cross-sectiona l area A1 .


I widen it, cross-sectional area A2.


This  is y--


it's the same for both .


I have here ins ide pressure P1 and here inside I have pressure P2 and this  is the density o f the

fluid .


There is here a velocity v2 , and there is here a ve locity v1.


And clearly v1 is way  larger than v2 because A1 times  v1 mus t be A2 times v2 because the fluid

is incompressible.


So the same amount o f ma tter tha t flows through here in one second must flow through here in 
one second . 

And so these have to be  the same , and since A1 is much sma ller than A2 , this velocity is much 
larger than v2. 

Now I'm going to apply Bernoulli's equation .


So the  first term te lls me that one-half rho v1 squared...


I can forget  the second term because I get  the same  term here as I ge t there because  I measure

the pressure here and I measure  the pressure there .


They have the same level of y.


So I can ignore the second term.


Plus P1 must be one-half rho v2 squared plus P2.


That's wha t Bernoulli's equa tion tells me.


Now, v1 is  larger than v2.


The only way tha t this can be correc t, then, is tha t P1 must be less than P2 .


So you w ill say, "Big deal." Well, it's a b ig deal, because I wou ld have guessed exactly the o ther

way around , and so would you, because here is where  the highes t ve locity is , and a ll our  instincts

would say , "Oh, if the velocity  is high,  there's a lo t of pressure." It's exactly the o ther way around . 

Here is the low pressure , and here is the high pressure , wh ich is one qu ite bizarre consequence 
of Bernoulli's equa tion. 

You must all have encoun tered in your  life what we call a siphon . 

They were used in  the medieval and they're s till used today. 

You have here ... 

A bucket in genera l is used with water--

lakes. 

We have wa ter here, bu t it could be any  liquid . 

And I stick in here a tube wh ich is small in diame ter, substantially smaller than this area here . 

And there w ill be water in here up to this  level--

this  level P2, y2. 

This  is y1 , increasing value o f y . 

This heigh t difference is h. 

P2 is one a tmosphere . 

I pu t a one there--

it's a tmosphere . 

And here , if it's open, then P1 is also one atmosphere. 

So there's air  in here and there's liquid in here . 

I take this open end in my mou th and I suck the wa ter in so tha t it's filled with this wa ter, full with 
this water . 

And strange as  it may be, it's like making a ho le in this tank. 

If I take my finger o ff here , the wa ter will star t to run ou t, and I w ill show you tha t. 

And you have here a velocity v1. 

The water will s tream down into  this here and the veloc ity here is approx ima tely zero, because

this area is so much larger than this cross-sectional area that to a good approximation this wa ter

is going down extremely slowly .


Let's ca ll this height difference d.


I apply Bernoulli's  law .


So now we have a situa tion where the y's are d ifferen t but the pressure is the same, because

right here at this poin t o f the liquid I have one a tmosphere, which is barome tric pressure, and

since this is open with the outside wor ld, P1 is a lso one atmosphere.


So now I lose my P term.


There I lost my y term; now  I lose my P term.


So now I have that one-ha lf rho ... rho--


this  is rho o f the liquid--


v1 squared plus rho g times y1 must be one-ha lf rho v2 squared , but we agreed that  that was

zero, so I don' t have tha t term.


So I only have rho gy2.


I lose my g's ...

no, I don' t lose my g's.


One-half rho v squared--


no, tha t's fine.


And so...  I lose my rho.


This  is one-half.


I lose my rho.


And so you ge t tha t one-ha lf v1 squared equals g times y2 minus y1, wh ich is h .


And so what do you find? Tha t the speed with which th is water  is running ou t here , v1 , is the

square roo t o f 2gh .


And you've seen tha t before.


If you take a pebble and you release a pebble from th is level and you le t it fa ll, it will reach th is 
point here , this  leve l with the speed the square roo t o f 2gh. 

We've seen  that many times . 

So wha t is happening here--

since the pressure terms are the same here and there , now there's only a conversion. 

Gravita tional potential energy--

which is higher here than there--

is now converted to kine tic energy. 

This siphon would on ly work  if d is  less than ten me ters . 

Because of  the barometric pressure you can never suck up this wa ter--

no one can ; a vacuum pump can't either--


to a level tha t is higher than ten me ters .


When I did the experiment  there with the cranberry juice, I was ab le to ge t it up to five me ters, bu t

ten me ters would have been  the theoretica l maximum.


So th is has to be less than ten meters that you go up.


If I wou ld have made a hole in this tank here , just like this, down to exactly this  level, and I would

have asked you to calcula te with what speed  the water  is running out, you wou ld have found

exactly the same if you had applied Bernoulli's equation.


This  is a way tha t people...


I've seen people stea l o ther peop le's gasoline in  the time that gasoline was very scarce and that

there were no locks yet on the gasoline caps .


You would pu t a hose in the gasoline tank and you wou ld have  to suck on it a little--


you have to sacrifice a little bit--


you ge t a little bit o f gasoline in your mou th, and  then you can just emp ty someone's gasoline

tank by having a canis ter or by having a jerrican and  fill it with gasoline.


And I'm going  to show tha t now to you by emp tying ...


That's still cranberry ju ice, by the way , from our  las t lecture.


So le t's pu t this up on a s tool.


So there is the hose--


it's tha t thing--


and I'm go ing to transfer th is liquid from here to here .


So firs t I have to fill it with cranberry juice.


And there it goes .


And as  long as this  level is below  that leve l, it keeps running .


Not so in tuitive .


I remember , I was a t a summer camp when I was maybe six or seven years o ld.


I cou ldn't be lieve it when I saw  this for the first time .


We had these ou tdoor sinks where we washed ourse lves and brushed our tee th , and the sink

was clogged, it was full with water .


And one o f the camp leaders took a hose, sucked up and it emp tied itself.


And I really though t, you know , you'd have to take spoonfuls of wa ter or maybe buckets and

scoop it ou t.


This  is the way you do it.


Very nonin tuitive .


The nonin tuitive par t is that it runs up against gravity there.


So we can let it sit there and we have a trans fer, mass transfer o f cranberry juice .


Last time I was tes ting my  lungs to see how s trong I was.


I wasn' t very good, righ t? I could only blow up one meter of wa ter and only suck one meter wa ter.


Differential pressure only one-tenth o f an a tmosphere .


Today I would like  to tes t one o f the studen ts who , no doubt, is more powerful than I am.


And I have here a funnel...


with a Ping-Pong ball here , very lightwe igh t, and we're going to have a contes t to see who can

blow  it the h ighest.


I have two funnels, so it's very hygienic.


I will try  it with th is one .


They're clean,  they  just...


We jus t got  them from the chemistry depar tment.


And so I would like  to see a volun teer--


woman or man, it doesn't matter.


You wan t to try  it, see whether you can reach the ceiling? You don' t want to try it? Come on! You

want to try  it? You're shy? You don't wan t to? Can  I persuade you?  I can .


Okay, come along.


Come righ t here.


You th ink you can make it to  the ce iling? It's only a very ligh t Ping-Pong ball.


So , you go like this, blow as hard as you can .


STUDENT: Okay .


LEW IN : Try it, don' t be nervous.


STUDENT: All righ t.


LEW IN : Straigh t up.


STUDENT: No ...


LEW IN : Blow as hard as you can--


get it ou t.


Amazing ! Do it again .


Come on , there must have been someth ing wrong .


[class laughs]


LEW IN : You're no t sick today, are you? Blow.


Harder! STUDENT: Is this a trick? LEWIN: No , there's nothing, there's no  trick in here .


I mean , my goodness--


this  is a Ping-Pong ba ll,  I'm no t a magician.


[class laughs]


LEW IN : Come on , b low  it up ! Hey, it doesn't work.


It's amazing .


Why don' t you sit down?


[class laughs]


LEW IN : Why doesn't it work? Why doesn' t it work? The harder you blow , the leas t it will work .


Air  is flowing here...


and right here , where there is very  little room, the air will have very h igh speed , way higher than it

has where it has lo ts of room.


And so a t the h ighest speed, you get the lowest pressure.


And so the Ping-Pong ball is sucked in while you're blowing it.


And to give you the conc lusive proof o f that I will do it this way .


I will put  the Ping-Pong ball like so , and I'm going to blow like th is, and if I blow hard enough, the

Ping-Pong ba ll will stay in  there because I genera te a lower pressure righ t here where the

passage is the smallest, but I have to b low quite hard.


[inha les deeply , b lowing hard ]


You see tha t? Isn' t tha t amaz ing? Tha t's the reason why she cou ldn't ge t it up .


[inha les deeply , b lowing hard ]


That's wha t Bernoulli does for you .


Not so in tuitive , is it?

I have here an air flow, a hose with air coming ou t, and I can show you there something that is

equally nonintu itive .


Let's s tart the air flow .


[air hissing ]


It's coming out.


I take a Ping-Pong ball.


It stays there.


Is that due to Mr . Bernoulli? No .


No, tha t's more complica ted physics, because it has to do with turbulence .


It has to do with vor tices, wh ich is very d ifficult.


What is happening here is tha t as the air flows , you ge t turbulence above here and the turbu lence

creates a lower pressure .


So the vortices, which are the turbulence, are keeping  this up , because there's a lower pressure

here and  there .


Bu t why  is  it so s table? I can see  that  I have...


because o f this turbulence , tha t it's held up .


Why is  it so stab le? If I give it a little push it doesn' t...

it's sucked back  in again .


It's very stable--


that is Bernoulli.


Because if I b low air, like so ...


then the velocity here is the highest, because it's diverg ing the air as it's coming out, but in the 
center, it is the highes t, and so when this Ping-Pong ba ll goes to this side , it clearly has a lower 
pressure here than there and so it's being sucked back  in again . 

So the stability  is due to Bernoulli, bu t the fact tha t it is held up is more difficu lt physics. 

It is so stable that I can even tilt this... 

and it will still stay there. 

Now I have something that I wan t you to show your parents on Thanksgiving. 

It's a little presen t for them, and tha t is some thing  tha t you can very easily do a t home. 

You take a glass and you fill it with cranberry ju ice--

not all the way , up to here . 

Take a  thin piece o f cardboard, the kind of stu ff  that you have on the back of pads . 

You pu t it on top . 

The tab le is beautifully se t--

turkey, everyth ing is there--

and you sugges t to your parents that you turn  this over. 

Your mo ther will scream bloody murder, because she would think that  the cranberry juice w ill fall

out.


In fact, it may actua lly fall ou t.


I can' t guaran tee you tha t it won' t.


[class laughs]


LEW IN : Bu t it may no t, in wh ich case you now have all  the too ls to explain  that.


Please do invite me to your Thanksgiving d inner and I'll show  it to your paren ts.
