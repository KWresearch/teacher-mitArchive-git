8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 29 

You see here the topics tha t w ill be on your p late on Monday. 

It's clearly not possib le for me in one exam to cover all these topics, so I will have  to make a

choice Monday .


Today I also have to make a choice .


I cannot do jus tice to all  these top ics in any dep th, so I will butter fly over them and some of  them I

won't even touch a t a ll.


However, wha t is no t covered today may well be on  the exam.


You will ge t loads o f equations.


Almost every equa tion that I could think o f will be on your exam.


There's a lso special tu toring  this weekend you can check tha t on the Web--


Sa turday and Sunday.


Let's s tart with a complete ly inelastic collision .


Complete ly inelastic collision .


We have mass m1 , we have mass m2 .


It's a one-dimensional problem.


This one has velocity v1, and this has veloc ity v2.


They collide , and after the collision they are toge ther--


because tha t's wha t it means when the collision is complete ly inelastic--


and they have a velocity , v prime.


If there is no ne t ex terna l force on the system, momentum mus t be conserved .


So I now have that m1 v1 plus m2 v2 must be m1 plus m2 times v prime .


One equa tion with one unknown--


v prime follows immediate ly.


You may say, "Gee, you should really have pu t arrows over here ." We ll, in the case tha t it is a

one-dimensiona l co llision , you can leave the arrows off because the signs automa tically take care

of tha t. 

Kine tic energy  is not conserved .


Be fore the collision , your kine tic energy equals one-ha lf m1 v1 squared plus one-ha lf m2 v2

squared.


After the collision , kinetic energy equals one-half m1 plus m2  times v prime squared.


And you can easily prove tha t this  is a lways less than that in case o f a comple tely  ine lastic

collision .


There's a lways kinetic energy des troyed, which  then comes out in the form o f hea t.


Let's do now an e lastic collision .


And I add  the word "comple tely" elas tic, bu t "e lastic"  itself is enough because that means that

kinetic energy  is conserved.


I s tart with the same initial condition: m1 v1 , m2 v2, bu t now , a fter the collision, m1 could either

go this way or th is way , I don't know .


So th is could be v1 prime,  this could be v1 prime .


m2, however, will a lways go in to th is d irection.


That's clear , because if you get hit from behind by object one , after the collision , you obviously go

in this direction.


Again, we don' t have  to put the arrows over  it, because the signs take care o f it in a one-

dimens ional case.


This w ill be plus , then .


That could be ... you could adop t tha t as your conven tion, and if it goes in this direction , then it w ill

be negative .


So if you find,  for v1 prime , minus something , it means  it's bounced back.


So now we can apply the conservation of momentum if there is no ex ternal force on  the system.


Internal force is fine.


All righ t, so now we have m1 v1 plus m2 v2 equals m1 v1 prime plus m2 v2 prime--


conservation o f momen tum.


Now we ge t the conservation of kine tic energy, because we know  it's an elas tic collision .


One-half m1 v1 squared , one-half m2 v2 squared--


that's be fore the collision .


After the collision , one-half m1 v1 prime squared plus one-half m2 v2 prime squared .


Two equa tions with two unknowns and in principle , you can so lve for v1 prime and for v2 prime,

except tha t it could be time-consuming .


And so on exams , what is norma lly done when you get a problem like  that...


Normally you ge t a prob lem whereby e ither m1 is made m2 or m1 is much, much larger than m2

or m1 is much, much smaller than m2, like banging a basketball on to a Ping-Pong ball or a Ping-
Pong ball onto a basketball. 

I will do a very simple example whereby I will take now  for you m1 equals m2, and I will ca ll tha t 
m and I will even simplify the prob lem by mak ing v2 zero, so the second object is standing still.


One-dimensional collision, one hits tha t objec t.


Very spec ial case.


So the conserva tion o f momen tum now becomes much simpler.


m times v1--


there is no v2--


equals m v1 pr ime plus m v2 prime .


Conservation o f kinetic energy is one-ha lf m v1 squared equa ls one-half m v1 prime squared plus

one-half m v2 prime squared .


Notice that now I lose my "m"s, which is very convenient.


Here I lose my one-half "m"s, even and th is is very easy to solve .


If you square this equation you ge t some thing tha t w ill look very similar to this .


If you square it, you get v1 squared equals v1 pr ime squared p lus v2 prime squared plus two v1

prime v2 prime.


And compare this equa tion w ith this equa tion--


they're almost iden tical, except  for this term, so th is term mus t be zero .


Bu t we know that v2 prime is no t zero .


It go t kicked and so it' ll go forward .


So wha t tha t means , then , is tha t v1 prime equa ls zero and if v1 prime equals zero , you see that

v2 prime equals v1.


And th is is that classic case whereby a ball h its ano ther ball.


This one has no speed.


It hits it with a certain velocity, v1.


They have the same mass.


After the collision , this one stands s till and  this one takes over the speed .


Famous New ton's Cradle .


You see it o ften with pendulums. 

It is the logo on the 8.01 home page, and  I showed you a demonstra tion here when we discussed 
that in lec tures . 

All righ t, le t's move on , and let's do someth ing now on torques, angular momen tum, rota tion and 
let's discuss the Atwood machine . 

The Atwood machine is a clever dev ice tha t a llows you to measure , to a reasonab le degree of 
accuracy, the gravita tional accelera tion . 

Here's a pulley , and the pu lley has mass m, has radius R. 

It's solid , so it's a solid d isk--

rotates, fric tionless, abou t poin t P, rad ius R . 

And there is a rope here , near massless--

we ignore the mass. 

Mass m2 is here and mass m1 is here , and let's assume that m2 is larger than m1. 

So th is will be acce lerated in this direc tion , this will be accelerated in this d irection, and this w ill

start to ro tate with angu lar ve locity omega , which w ill be a func tion o f time .


And now the first thing we wan t to do

is to make up " free-body" diagrams.


"Free-body" diagrams, for th is one, is easy.


m1 g down... and T1 up.


For this one , we have m2 g down and we have T2 up.


For the pulley, it's a little b it more complicated.


This  is that po int P.


If here is a tension T1 tha t's pu lling down on the pulley--


so th is is T1--


and this T2 is pulling down on the pu lley--


so there's T2--


it has a mass, so it has weigh t mg .


The sum of all forces on the pulley must be zero ; o therwise it would accelera te itse lf down , which

it doesn't.


And so there has to be a force up--


I'll call it n .


And that force n has to cancel ou t a ll these  three forces .


So tha t mus t be T1 plus T2 plus mg.


We will not need it any fur ther  in our calcu lations, bu t there has to be a force to ho ld tha t in place ,

so to speak .


So now we're going to calcu late the accelera tion under the condition that the rope does not slip .


That means there is fric tion with the pulley--


not fric tion here , but here .


Otherw ise, the rope would slip , the rope would slip.


What it means , if there is no slip , that if the rope moves one centimeter that the wheel also turns

at the circumference one cen time ter.


That's wha t it means when there is no slip .


That means the velocity of the rope--


v of r, v o f the rope--


must be omega times R of the pulley .


That's wha t "no slip" means .


So the accelera tion--


which is the derivative o f tha t velocity o f the rope--


A, is omega dot  times R , which is a lpha times R.


Omega is the angular velocity and alpha is the angular acceleration.


This  is a condition ... it is an important cond ition for no s lip.


So le t's now star t at object number one and write down Newton's second law .


I call this the pos itive direc tion  for object one and I call this the positive d irection for objec t two--


just easier for me.


So we get T1 minus m1 g must be m1 a--


one equation .


I don't know wha t T1 is, I don' t know what a is.


Second equation, for this one .


I call this the pos itive direc tion .


m2 g minus T2 must be m2 a--


second equation.


One unknown has been added , so I need more.


Of course I need more.


I a lso have to think about the pulley .


The pulley ... the ne t force on the pu lley  is zero .


That's why this stays  in place , but it is go ing to rotate because this force T2 is  larger than this T1 .


There is a torque rela tive to that point P, and torque is defined as r cross F.


The torque relative  to poin t P, the magnitude is this pos ition vector times this force .


That is a torque in  the blackboard .


What is  in the blackboard,  I will call positive.


The torque , due to  this force , is ou t of the b lackboard , and I will ca ll tha t nega tive .


Since this angle is 90 degrees,  I simply ge t tha t the torque relative  to poin t P equa ls the radius of

the cylinder--


the radius of that pu lley--


times T2.


That's the positive par t, and  the nega tive part is the rad ius times T1.


Notice that th is force and this force go through P, do no t con tribu te to  the torque.


And that now equa ls the moment of inertia about that point P, times alpha.


Bu t since we have no slip , a lpha is a d ivided by R .


So it's the momen t o f iner tia abou t poin t P times a divided by R.


Bu t since it is a rotating d isk which is rota ting about its center of mass...


I know  the momen t of iner tia , I looked  that up--


if you need it during your exam, you will find that in the exam--


that is one-ha lf MR squared...


one-half MR squared times a divided by R and I lose one R , and so I  find , then , tha t T2 minus T1

equals one-half Ma .


Notice I also lose my second R .


And so now I have a third equa tion and I can solve  for T2, I can solve for T1 and  I can solve for a .


And you can do tha t as well as I can .


If you find the result, you should always do a little b it of  testing to make sure that your resu lt 
makes sense . 

And wha t you shou ld do is you should say... 

You should make sure tha t m2 g is larger than T2 . 

That's a mus t--

otherwise , it's no t be ing accelera ted down . 

You should also check tha t T1 comes ou t larger than m1 g. 

That's also a mus t. 

And you should also check tha t T2 be larger than T1. 

Otherw ise, the pulley wouldn't rotate in clockwise direc tion.


It would a lso be use ful, which is a tr ivial check, to stick in your resu lts m1 equals m2 .


That shou ld g ive you  tha t the accelera tion should be zero and it shou ld give you tha t T1 equals

T2.


Those are obv ious things and tha t can be done very s imply .


It takes you no more  than ten seconds.


And if it's... any one o f these is not met, then somewhere you slipped up and it will give you an

opportun ity to go over the prob lem again .


All righ t, le t's now do another problem--


simple harmon ic oscillation of a physical pendu lum.


I have here a rod--


mass M, length l--


rotating here abou t an ax is perpendicular to the blackboard withou t fric tion .


Here is the cen ter of the rod , and le t this angle be  the ta .


There is a torque rela tive to poin t P.


There is also a force that goes through point P.


I'm no t even interes ted in that force.


I know  that it's here, mg.


Since I'm going to take the torque rela tive to po int P,  I don't worry about the force, bu t there has

to be a  force through po int P.


Otherw ise this ruler would be accelera ted down with acceleration g , if  this  is the only force there 
were. 

Bu t we know that's no t the case, it's go ing to swing . 

So there has to be a force to P. 

I don't wan t to know what it is, bu t there has to be one . 

So the  torque rela tive to po int P--

the magnitude--


is the pos ition vec tor, r of P, from here to here crossed with th is force.


And so tha t makes  it one-half l  times mg times the sine of the ang le, and  that's ... the angle is

theta so that is times the sine o f the ta .


The cross product has the sine o f the angle in it.


So th is is the torque rela tive to po int P which also mus t be the momen t of iner tia about poin t P

times a lpha .


No different  from wha t we just had with the pulley.


So alpha equals omega dot.


It's also the ta doub le dot.


This omega is the angular velocity--


it's d  theta/d t and the der ivative gives me the angu lar acceleration .


There has to be a minus sign here , tha t's importan t because the torque is restor ing--


the same situa tion we had when we had a spr ing.


We were oscillating a spring, the spring force is minus kx.


The minus sign here plays exactly the same role.


So I can write down here minus I o f p  the ta double do t.


Now, if we take a small angle approximation--


"small angle approximation"--


then the sine o f the ta is approximately the ta , if the ta is  in radians.


And so I can rep lace now the sine o f the ta here by theta and so now I find, if I bring th is to the

other side , I get theta double do t p lus one-half lMg div ided by the momen t o f iner tia abou t poin t P

times the ta equals zero.


Needless to say that  I am happy  like a clam a t high tide because I see here an equa tion which

clearly tells me tha t we have a simple harmonic oscilla tion--


theta double do t plus a cons tan t times the ta is zero . 

And so we must ge t as a solu tion  that  theta mus t be some maximum angle times the cosine o f 
omega  t p lus or minus phi. 

This omega has no thing to do with tha t omega. 

This  is the angular frequency . 

This  is rela ted to the period T o f the oscillation, wh ich is two pi div ided by omega. 

This  is a constant. 

This omega is no t a cons tan t. 

It is unfor tuna te , in physics, tha t we use  the same symbol. 

The angular velocity  is zero when the objec t s tands s till; is a max imum when the objec t is here . 

That omega is always the same. 

It's rela ted to how  long it takes to make one oscilla tion . 

Bo th are called omega, bo th are radians per second. 

Couldn' t be more confus ing. 

All righ t, if we find  I o f P then we can solve  for the frequency, angular frequency and we can solve

for the period .


So le t's do the... calcu late  the momen t of inertia about point P.


In order to do tha t, we have to apply the Paralle l-Axis Theorem because you will probably be

given the moment o f inertia for ro ta tion about the axis through the cen ter o f mass parallel to this

axis.


And then you will have to add the mass times the d istance be tween these two axes squared to

apply the Paralle l Axis Theorem.


So th is is the momen t o f iner tia abou t the cen ter o f mass plus m times the d istance squared.


And the d istance be tween  these two axes  is one-half l, so th is is one-quarter  l squared .


I look up in a table wha t the moment o f inertia is for ro tation o f a rod abou t its cen ter--


a perpendicular rod is perpendicu lar to the axis--


and tha t is 1 /12 Ml squared p lus one-quarter Ml squared give me one-th ird Ml squared .


So I know now wha t I o f P is , and so now I can solve for the value for omega--


the angular frequency .


I'll do tha t here so tha t we keep everything on one blackboard.


So th is term here , which is omega squared... 

Omega squared equals one-ha lf lMg divided by one- third Ml squared.


I lose one l, I lose one M--


very common , a lways lose your "M"s  in gravity--


and so th is is three-halves g d ivided by  l.


And so the period o f one oscilla tion is two p i d ivided by omega--


omega is the square roo t of this--


so tha t becomes the square roo t o f two- thirds  l over g .


And that is the period o f the oscillation of this ru ler.


We worked on something similar  in lectures and we even measured the period and we found

very, very good agreemen t w ith the theore tica l prediction.


You can ask, now, wha t is the kine tic energy of rota tion of this rod, which changes with time?

Kine tic energy of ro tation is one-half I omega squared.


Remember , the linear kinetic energy  is one-half mv squared.


The m becomes I when you go to rota tion, and v becomes omega.


So the kine tic energy of ro tation equals one-half  I omega squared--


you'll find  this equa tion on your exam.


This  is I about that po int P.


You know wha t the ta is, as a function of time .


So omega equals d theta /d t, so you can find wha t omega is .


You know wha t I o f P is , we jus t ca lcula ted it.


And so you know wha t the kine tic energy of rotation is at any momen t in time.


It will change.


It will be zero when this comes to a halt, and it will be a max imum when it is here .


It's a con tinuous conversion from gravita tional potential energy , wh ich is a maximum here , to

kinetic energy , wh ich is a maximum here .


And so this will obv iously change with time--


the k inetic energy o f ro ta tion .


I thought problem 8-1 was a nice example o f how to apply Kepler's  laws , New ton's  laws of gravity

in the case  tha t we have an elliptical orbit.


Here we have a plane t, mass M, rad ius R .


It's not ro tating and it has no atmosphere.


Grant you , a little bit ar tificial.


We launch a sa tellite and the sate llite gets a ve locity here which was ca lled v zero as  it is r igh t

here a t the surface and  this angle , 20 degrees .


And we were told tha t the poin t far thes t away was five plane ts' radii away.


So if  I try to ske tch the elliptical orbit--


assuming that  the ve locity is  instantaneously reached ; that means, th is po int must also be a poin t

of the orbit.


If I try to make a ske tch, then tha t elliptica l orbit wou ld look someth ing like th is.


Something like this.


And then,  this distance is five R .


I call this poin t A.


It's the po int that is far thes t away from the center .


It's clear tha t the sa tellite will crash back onto the plane t, bu t tha t's no concern to us .


When I draw this ellipse , I made  the assump tion tha t a ll the mass o f the plane t was  inside the

ellipse--


for instance , somewhere here.


Now, tha t is not the case , so on ly this part of  the ellipse is rea listic and this part, of course, is no t.


What you're being asked is to calcula te wha t v zero was only based on the in formation of the 5R

and the 20 degrees and on the mass.


And I can add to it what is the velocity here at A, when it is farthes t away, and I can even add to it

what is the semimajor axis where this  is 2a? All o f tha t comes for free with tha t initia l cond ition

and the knowledge tha t it goes ou t five planets' radii.


The angular momentum, l, equals R cross P.


Angu lar momen tum is conserved for this object in orbit--


mass m--


but only  if you take  the angular momen tum rela tive to this point.


I don't know wha t I ca lled th is po int.


It looks  like I called it P.


I can hard ly read it, I' ll call it C for now .


So angular momen tum o f this object in th is orbit is not conserved rela tive to any point, but it's on ly 
conserved rela tive to  this poin t. 

So the angular momentum rela tive to point C at th is momen t in time 

is the pos ition vec tor--

which is R--

times the velocity, bu t I have to multiply  it by the sine o f 20 degrees . 

So it is m... it is mv , r ight? so we ge t a v zero , here. 

We ge t a cap ita l R here , and we get the sine of 20 degrees. 

R times ... indeed.


That must also be the angular momentum righ t here.


The fac t tha t the angu lar momen tum is  in the b lackboard is no concern to me ; I just wan t to know

the magnitude .


When the object is here, the angular momentum is the position vec tor wh ich has length 5R .


The ve locity  is v o f A, but the angle is now 90 degrees, so the sine o f the ang le is one.


So I ge t m times vA times five R .


I lose my  little m, and I have one equation with two unknowns.


I don't know wha t v zero is and  I don't know wha t v of A is.


I need another equa tion .


Well, these are conservative  forces--


we're dea ling with gravity--


so mechanical energy must be conserved or, wha t we used to say--


the to tal energy o f the system is conserved .


The to tal energy of  the sys tem is kine tic energy p lus po tential energy ...


must be conserved , must be  the same here as  it is there.


What is the  tota l energy here? The kine tic energy  is one-half m v zero squared.


What is the po ten tial energy here? It is minus mMG divided by  its dis tance to  the center , which is

capital R .


That is the total energy r ight here .


The to tal energy here could no t have changed .


It must therefore be one-half m vA squared minus mMG, but now  the distance equals 5R.


Apar t from  the fac t tha t I lose my  little m, notice I have a second equa tion.


I d idn't add any unknowns, so I have two equa tions with two unknowns, v zero and v of A.


And you can solve  for tha t, you can find bo th .


Interestingly enough , you can also find the semimajor axis because the total energy of the system

is also minus mMG divided by 2A.


This equa tion is also on your exam.


And so if you know v zero, or you know v A, then you can...


The m cancels and you can a lso calcu late  the semima jor axis.


Okay, Doppler shift.


Let's do some thing about Dopp ler sh ift.


First, Doppler shift of elec tromagne tic radia tion : ligh t, radio waves , X rays.


There is a star moving rela tive to us with a velocity v .


Since we're dealing with e lectromagnetic radiation, we don't have to ask whether the star  is

moving rela tive to us or we are moving rela tive to  the star.


That ques tion is a meaning less ques tion in specia l re lativity.


You are here.


You are receiving the frequency F prime , and here is that s tar and tha t s tar  is moving with a

certain velocity--


let's say this velocity , v , and this ang le is theta.


So th is component of  the ve locity in our direc tion is v cosine the ta.


We call tha t the radia l component.


And whe ther the star is moving to us or we to the star makes no d ifference .


If the velocity of  the star  is much , much sma ller than C , then F prime,  the one that you will

receive, equals F times one plus v over C times the cos ine o f the ta .


This equa tion is on your exam.


C is three times ten to the fifth kilome ters per second.


If cosine theta is positive,  the objec t is approaching and you observe a higher frequency.


If cosine theta is nega tive , the object is go ing away .


The radial componen t is away from us and the frequency is lower.


In optica l as tronomy, we canno t measure frequenc ies.


We can only measure wavelength .


And the connection between waveleng th and frequency...


Lambda equals the speed o f ligh t divided by the  frequency.


So we can subs titute in  that equation F equals C divided by  lambda and F prime equals C divided

by lambda prime .


When we do tha t and we a lso make use of th is approximation--


that one d ivided by one plus x  is approxima tely one minus x as  long as x is much, much smaller

than one--


this  is the firs t order term in  the Taylor Expansion .


Then you can  find that now  lambda prime becomes  lambda times one minus--


it becomes a minus sign ; the plus changes to a minus s ign, for  that reason--


times v divided by C times cosine the ta .


Notice that here , you have  that radial ve locity.


And you have tha t here.


If lambda prime is  larger than lambda,  the objec t is going away from us.


We call tha t "red shift."


If the object is receding--


if lambda prime is less than lambda--


we call that "blue shift," because the wave leng ths become shorter  in th is time--


move towards the blue end o f the spectrum.


Here it becomes larger, shifts to the red par t of the spectrum.


The blue shift means the object is approaching you .


During the lec ture tha t we d iscussed this , we  took an example where lambda prime over  lambda

was 1.00333 .


If you substitu te tha t in this equation, you'll  find that v cosine the ta equals minus 100 kilome ters

per second .


So wha t it means--


all you know  is the radial ve locity; you never ge t any  informa tion abou t the angle--


that  the radial veloc ity  is 100 kilometers per second away from us, or we are moving 100

kilome ters per second away from the s tar.


That's the same th ing in special rela tivity.


If we apply th is to sound , then we ge t a very similar equation.


Suppose you sit still in 26 .100 and I move a sound source to you , but you don' t move .


Then you get the similar equation that f prime--


that's the frequency that you will hear--


equals f times one plus v over v sound times the cosine of theta, and the sound's speed is about

340 me ters per second at room tempera ture .


In o ther words , if I tw irl some thing around in a circle and you are in the plane o f that circle--


you are here--


then when the object comes to you, you hear a maximum frequency--


f prime is  larger than f.


When it goes away from you, you hear a decrease in frequency--


smaller than f.


And when the objec t is here , and when it is here--


when the angle is 90 degrees and  the cos ine the ta is zero--


you'll find  f prime equals f,  f prime equals f.


So when I twirl some thing around ...


let's suppose I tw irl it around with an orbital velocity.


If I call  that orbital velocity of 3 .4 me ters per second--


just to ge t some nice numbers, then th is is .01...


And so if it comes to you, you hear an increase of one percent in the  frequency .


When it goes away from you, you hear a decrease o f one percen t.


I have here a sound source which produces roughly 1,500 her tz.


[mach ine emits  high-pitched tone ]


I cou ld twirl it around .


I can do it once per second around, which gives you even twice this speed .


And so you wou ld hear a two percen t increase when it comes to you;  two percent decrease when

it goes away from you .


[tone wavers be tween higher  and lower pitch ]


Can you hear the Doppler shift? It's a lways d ifficult in a lecture hall because you ge t re flec tions 
from the wall. 

Can you hear  it, when it comes to you , tha t the pitch is higher than when it goes away from you? 

Okay, ro lling ob jects . 

Let's ro ll some thing down the hill. 

Classic problem. 

Very o ften you see  that on exams. 

We take a ba ll and we roll it down an incline . 

This  is the incline and the angle is be ta . 

Here is the ba ll, it's a sphere . 

It's a so lid sphere, it has mass m with rad ius R and it is solid. 

This  is the center o f tha t ball. 

I call this poin t P. 

I pu t all the forces on tha t I can think o f. 

There is mg here... 

at this poin t P, the normal  force from the surface ... 

and there is friction . 

This  is the fric tiona l force. 

The sum of Ff and the norma l force is wha t we ca ll the contact force.


That is the force w ith which  the incline pushes back on to the ball, but we normally decompose

that in a direc tion along the slope and perpendicular to the s lope .


So these are the only three forces that  this object is experiencing and I can ask you now wha t is

"a"--


the accelera tion at wh ich it goes down the slope--


and I can ask you what is the fr ictional force .


I will ask you that under  the conditions of "pure roll." What does pure ro ll mean? It means that if

this--


the c ircumference here--


moves one centime ter tha t the cen ter of mass has also moved one cen time ter.


So it means tha t the velocity of  the center--

so th is veloc ity , v of c--


at a ll moments  in time will be omega R .


And omega is the angular ve locity which is changing w ith time .


That is the cond ition of pure roll.


At all momen ts in time if I have a rota ting sphere or cylinder always will the circumferen tia l speed

be omega R .


It could be standing still and jus t ro tating like th is, slipp ing like he ll and not moving forward--


then the circumferential speed is always omega R .


Bu t if the cen ter also moves with tha t same speed , only then do we call it pure ro ll.


If you take the derivative o f th is, you get a equals omega do t times R .


That equals a lpha R, alpha being  the angular acceleration.


All righ t, we are going to write down now the torque re lative to that po int C .


If I take poin t C , then  I lose the force mg and I lose the  force N .


There is on ly one force tha t I have to dea l with .


For the torque, rela tive to po int C ...


The fac t tha t the torque is in  the blackboard is of no concern to me .


I just wan t to know the magnitude--


that is R times Ff, R times the  frictional force .


That must be the momen t o f iner tia abou t tha t poin t C times a lpha .


We've seen  this now twice already.


And so, since alpha is a divided by R,  this  is I o f c times a d ivided by R .


This  is one equation and I have a as an unknown and I have Ff as an unknown.


There is no t enough--


I need more .


Newton's second law always holds--


the center o f mass...


For the center o f mass, it mus t a lways ho ld tha t F equa ls Ma.


So all I do now  is I go to the center of mass and I say , What are the forces wh ich are ac ting down

the s lope? I am not in teres ted in the ones perpendicular to the slope--


only the ones down the slope.


That must be Ma--


it's nonnego tiable , because tha t is the quality, charac teristic o f the cen ter of mass.


Well, this one is uphill and the only one that is downh ill  is the component o f mg along the slope ,

which is Mg sine beta .


I call tha t the plus direc tion , so  I ge t Mg sine be ta minus tha t fric tiona l force equals M  times a .


It's my second equa tion .


I have two equa tions with two unknowns, and I can solve.


a is an unknown , and the fr ictional force is an unknown .


You can do tha t as we ll as I can--


I will just give you the resu lts .


I don't wan t to waste your time on the algebra .


a, the accelera tion , under the conditions of pure roll--


but only under the cond itions o f pure roll--


equals MR squared times g times the sine of be ta d ivided by MR squared plus the momen t of

inertia about that po int C .


And the frictional force--


you can see tha t from this equa tion--


is the momen t o f iner tia times a divided by R squared.


And I will leave "a" as  it is because it becomes too complicated o therwise .


And so the fric tional force becomes the moment o f inertia about C times a divided by R squared.


So th is a has to be substitu ted in here .


The acceleration is independen t o f the mass and independent o f the radius--


very nonin tuitive .


It doesn' t ma tter whe ther you take a ball  this big or this big.


It doesn' t ma tter wha t the mass is .


The reason for tha t is tha t, as you w ill see shortly ,  that  the momen t of inertia also con tains the

term MR squared, and so all the MR squares will disappear.


Let's first  take a look a t beta rela ted  to a .


Notice when be ta equals zero,  tha t a equa ls zero .


It be tter be .


If there is no slope , there cannot be any acceleration .


Notice if a equa ls zero that the frictional  force is also zero.


It be tter be .


So tha t is an easy check tha t you can do--


interna l consis tency check.


So now  le t's look a t I of C.


What is I of C? I look it up in the table .


A ball, sphere ro ta ting about an axis through the center of mass.


It's one of the few that I happen to remember--


is two- fifths MR squared.


If I substitu te that in here , I'll  find that the acce leration under the conditions of pure roll is five-

sevenths g times the sine of be ta .


And I find that the frictional force, F of  f, equa ls two-sevenths,  I believe , times Mg sine be ta .


Indeed .


These are the results by substitu ting the momen t of inertia in there .


Let's  look a t these results a little closer.


If there were no  friction, then we know tha t the accelera tion would have been g sine be ta .


We remember tha t--


a slid ing objec t with no fric tion wou ld be g sine be ta .


Why is  it now  lower? Five-seven ths is  lower than one .


It's obvious .


Because when this object comes ro lling down, the kinetic energy , the to tal kine tic energy  is

kinetic energy of ro tation plus the linear portion of the kinetic energy--


the forward motion due to  this one-half Mv squared .


When you have a slid ing objec t, there is  only the linear componen t.


There is no ro tational kine tic energy .


So now the linear k inetic energy must be lower because some grav ita tional potential energy goes

into rotational kine tic energy.


And so it must go s lower and so the accelera tion must be less .


It's comp letely  intu itive tha t it is less than g sine beta .


Let's  look a t the frictional force.


This  is a situation of pure roll.


We know that  the fric tiona l force can never exceed the maximum value possible .


That is a no-no.


If the frictional force becomes the maximum one , it wou ld start to slip .


It would no longer be pure ro ll.


In o ther words , there is a necessary condition that  the frictiona l force, which is two-sevenths Mg

sine be ta , mus t be less than the maximum  frictional force.


Bu t the max imum fric tional force is mu s--


static fr iction coe fficien t times this value N--


and this value N  is mg cos ine the ta ... beta .


And so this  is mu s times Mg cosine be ta.


I lose my Mg--


no surprise--


and so a necessary condition is that  the s ta tic friction coefficien t mus t be larger than two-

sevenths times the  tangen t of alpha in order to have pure roll.


Not alpha--


I don't know wha t is wrong with me--


beta .


And th is, of course , is pleasing in a way, because wha t this  is telling you--


and we all know  that by our  instinct, you  feel it in your s tomach--


that if you make the angle too large, if you tilt tha t,  there's no way tha t you're go ing to ge t pure

roll.


It will s tart rolling, o f course, but it also s tarts slipping .


For ins tance , if you freeze the fric tion coefficient and you say the fric tion coe fficien t is 0.2, then it

means that be ta--


the angle be ta--


must be less than 35 degrees.


That's  jus t an example.


Well, tha t's in tuitive ly pleasing .


Remember that during one o f the lec tures we ca lcula ted the period of oscillation of an objec t tha t

was sliding on an a ir track withou t fric tion .


And it was a curve o f a circle with a huge radius .


It was hundreds of meters.


And we had a sliding ob ject here and it was slid ing without fric tion .


And we derived that the period was two pi times the square roo t o f R d ivided by g, as  if this were

a pendulum w ith length R , and tha t's in fact wha t it is .


We d id tha t w ith  the air track and the results were fantastically  in agreemen t w ith our predic tion ,

unbelievable accuracy.


And then we d id it with a smaller radius--


with a ball, a rolling ball, this one.


The radius of that curvature was 85 centimeters , and we predic ted a period o f 1 .85 seconds--


this equa tion .


And we measured it, and what did we  find? Way higher .


We observed some thing like , I th ink, 2 .3 seconds.


And I asked you at the end o f the lec ture , why? And some of you said , "We ll, the radius  is

smaller ." Tha t was no reason , because the ang le--


the displacemen t angle--


was still very sma ll.


This maximum angle , the ta maximum, was so small that tha t could never explain why the per iod

was so much larger .


Bu t now you know , because when th is object rolls down, the kine tic energy  is par tia lly  in the

linear term and partially  in rota tion--


partially in the linear term and par tia lly  in ro ta tion .


If it is slid ing, it is a ll in the linear term, so it clearly goes fas ter.


Now it has to share w ith the ro ta tion .


And so tha t's the reason why we  found the higher period.


And that's precisely the situa tion that you have here.


I want to repeat that this is wha t you have on your pla te on Monday.


There is no way that I can cover a ll of that during one exam.


Please ho ld it--


we have one minu te left.


There's no way I can cover a ll of that during one exam.


I'll have to make a cho ice.


I will pick only a  few.


Neither could  I cover today, at any dep th , a ll these  topics.


The ones tha t I did no t cover doesn' t mean a t all that you will not see them on the exam.


There is a special  tutoring schedule  this weekend that you can make use of and I believe that  this

lecture will be on PIVoT tomorrow morn ing .


I wish you luck and I'll see you Monday .
