Transcript â€“ Lecture 4 

Today, we're going to take it quite easy. 

I a lso have to  take it a little easy because my voice may be petering out, if I'm not 
careful. 

We're going to app ly today what we have learned, so there is nothing new but  its 
applications.


And that's important--


things that... you can let it sink in.


We have here a trajectory of a golf ba ll or a tennis ba ll in 26.100.


We shoot it up at an ang le a lpha.


The horizonta l component in the x direction is v zero cosine a lpha and the vertical

component is v zero sine alpha.


It reaches the highest point at P and it returns to the ground at point S.


This is the increasing y d irection and this is the increasing x direction.


We're going to use, very heavily, the equations that you see here that are so  familiar

with us.


These are the one-dimensional equations in x direction where there is no

acceleration and the one-dimensional equations  in the y direction where there is

acceleration.


In order to use these equations we need all these constants--


x zero, v zero x and v zero y.


We have seen those last time.


I choose for x zero...


I choose zero arb itrarily.


Also for y zero.


The velocity in the x direction w ill never change.


This v zero x will always remain v zero cosine alpha. 

The velocity in the y direction, however,  in the beginning at t equals zero is v zero 
sine alpha. 

And that one will change, because there is here this t and that's why the velocity is 
going to change.


This t will do it.


And the acceleration  in the y direction--


since this is increasing value of y--


is going to be negative 9.8.


Since I ca ll always 9.8 p lus...


since I always ca ll g "p lus 9.8," this  is minus g.


I now want to ask first the question that you may never have seen answered: what

is the shape of this? Well, we can go to equation number three there and we can

write down this equation number three: That y, as a  function of time, equals v zero

yt so it is v zero sine a lpha times t minus one-half gt squared. 

That's the equation in y. 

I go to equation number one and I write down x--

at any moment in time--

equa ls v zero z times t so that is v zero cosine a lpha times t. 

Now I eliminate t, and the best way to do that is to do it here--

to write for t, x d ivided by v zero cosine a lpha. 

Now I can drop all sub indexes t because we're now going to see x versus y. 

We're going to eliminate t. 

So this time here, I'm going to substitute in here and in there and so I'm going to

get y equa ls...


There's a v zero here and there's a v zero there that cancels.


There's a sine alpha here and a cosine a lpha there that makes it a tangent of a lpha.


And then I have here the x and I get minus one-half g times this squared--


x squared divided by v zero cosine a lpha squared.


And now look very carefully.


Y is a constant times x minus another constant times x squared.


That  is a parabola.


It's a second-order equation in x, and is a parabola and a parabola has this shape.


So you so see now, by eliminating the time that we have here a parabola.


Now I want to massage this quite a bit further today.


I would like to know at what time the ob ject here comes to a halt to its highest

point.


It comes to a halt in the y d irection.


It comes to a highest point and  I want to know how high that is.


Well, the best way to do  is to go  to equation four and you say, to equation four,

"When are you zero?" Because that is the moment that the velocity in the y direction

becomes zero.


It must be at its highest point, then.


So in order to find, for us, the position of the highest point P we first ask ourselves

the question from equation number four: when is the velocity in the y direction zero?

And that then becomes v zero y which is v zero sine alpha minus gt and out pops

that t at point P is going to be v zero sine alpha divided by g.


That's the time that it takes for the object to reach the highest point.


Where is it, then? What is the highest point above the ground? Well, now we have to

go to equation number three and you have to substitute this time in there so that

highest point h, which is y at the time t of P equals v zero yt--


that is v zero times the sine of alpha.


But you have to multiply it by this time and so I get another v zero sine alpha and I

get a g here minus gt mi...


oh, no, no, this equa...


minus ha lf dt squared minus one-ha lf g times this one squared which is v zero sine

alpha squared, divided by g...


divided by g squared because there is a g here, you see? So you square the whole

thing if it's t squared.


You lose one g and you will find, then, that the highest point--


let's write it down here so that we don't block that blackboard--


the highest point in the sky equals v zero sine alpha squared d ivided by 2g.


That  is the highest point.


Let's give that some color because we may want to keep that.


Is it reasonab le that the point, the highest point in the sky gets higher when v zero

is higher? Of course.


If I shoot it up at a higher speed of course it will get higher.


So that's completely intuitive that v zero is upstairs.


If I increase the angle from a small ang le to larger and larger and larger is it

reasonable that it w ill get higher? Of course.


You all feel in your stomach that the highest possib le value you can get is when you

make alpha 90 degrees for a g iven velocity.


That's the highest it will go in the sky.


So clearly, this is a lso very pleasing.


If you did the experiment on the moon with the same initial speed, it will go much

higher so you are a lso happy to see that this g here is downstairs.


So that makes sense.


At what time will the ob ject be at point S? Now,  there are two ways that you can do

that.


You either go to this equation, number three and you ask equation number three,

"When are you zero?"  It will give you two answers.


It will say, "I am zero here at this time" and "I am zero at that time." And those are

the two times that you want and this  is the one you pick.


That's perfectly fine.


I think there's a faster way to do  it, and that's the following.


This is a parabola, so it's completely symmetric about the vertical, about P.


So to climb up from O to P must take the same amount of time as to go down  from P

to S and so I cla im that the time to reach point S must be twice the time to reach

point P and therefore it's going to be two v zero sine alpha d ivided by g. 

But now we want to look aga in whether the v zeros and the sine alphas have the 
right place. 

Indeed, if I increase the speed, I would expect it to take longer before it reaches S. 

If I give it a larger speed, it will come out farther and obviously, the time w ill take 
longer. 

If I do it at a higher angle, it w ill a lso take longer and if I do it on the moon, it w ill 
also  take longer. 

So this makes sense--

these equations are pleasing in terms of the rate that v zero and sine alpha appear in 
the equations. 

But now comes an  important point which I am going to use throughout this lecture.


I want to know what OS is.


The d istance OS... I shoot it up and it hits the floor again What  is that distance that

it travels? Well, for that, I need equation number one.


It is v zero x times the time and v zero x is v zero cosine alpha.


We got v zero cosine alpha times the time to hit it--


that is two v zero sine alpha.


So I get a  two here, I get a sine alpha, and I get a g here and I have another v zero

there, and so the answer is a v zero squared times the sine of the double angle--


remember, two cosine a lpha sine alpha is the sine of two alpha--


divided by g.


And this is OS, and I'm going to need this a lot.


This reminds me not to remove it.


Now, I sort of wonder, and you should too why  is it that the highest point in the sky

has a v zero squared and why  is the farthest point a lso...


why does it also have a v zero squared? There must be a way that you can reason 
that. 

Why is it not just v zero? Why is it v zero squared? Well, I'll let you argue about the 
highest points, and I'll give you a good reason for the distance, OS.


Don't look at the equations.


You simply...


Think for a change.


Don't look at the equations.


I double the speed.


If I double the speed, then it's quite reasonab le that the time that it takes for the 
object to reach the ground will double, but while the time that it flies has doubled the 
horizontal velocity has also doub led. 

And so the d istance that it will travel in horizontal direction is four times that--

twice because the time has doubled and another factor of two because the horizonta l

component has a lso doubled.


So that's why you see v zero squared there--


completely pleasing.


This tells you immediately that the...


if you want to throw a ball as far as possib le--


people who play baseba ll know that--


you should do it at 45 degrees.


Because if you throw it at 45 degrees then this angle, 90 degrees, and that is one.


Of course, in reality, the baseball player knows better.


They g ive effect to the ball, they dea l w ith a ir drag they sp in the ball, and then these

equations are not valid.


This is only in case we deal with... w ith vacuum.


I now would like to test some of the results that we have here...


we have worked out here.


I am going to shoot a pellet...


a meta l ball.


I'm going to shoot it at various ang les: 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 45 degrees and I'm

going to make a prediction  if I shoot it up from there, where  it will hit the tab le.


A measurement is meaning less without knowing the uncerta inties.


So that's the first thing we have to dea l with.


The first thing I want to know is what is the velocity of this bullet when it comes out

of the spring and does it vary if I do  it three, five, six times in a row? It's not a

$20,000 spring gun, so it is likely to vary.


And the way I am going to do that is as follows.


If I shoot an object vertically up--


that is, the maximum va lue that it can go--

and w ith an alpha equals 90 degrees then the sine of a lpha is one and the height is v 
zero squared divided by two g. 

In other words, if I measure the height if I shoot it up vertically and you can 
measure that for me--


you will see how I am asking you to do that--


then we can calculate v zero squared.


So the first thing I want to do is to shoot it up vertica lly and how are you going to

help me to ca lculate...


to tell me how high it is? That comes easier than you think.

The top part...


oh, we'll remove this.


The top part of this stick is three meters, the top mark.


That very top mark is three meters and all I want you to tell me whether it is yay

much above or yay much below and then we'll estimate that yay much and then we'll

make a guess.


And I'll do it twice.


So if you are ready? Make sure that you can distinguish between above and below--


it makes a big difference, yeah?

Okay? Three, two, one, zero.


[ball whooshes]


Okay, was it higher or lower? CLASS: H igher.


LEWIN: How much? This much? Do we agree? Let's say five centimeters, right?

We're going to a llow for an uncerta inty.


I'll do  it again.


I want to see how well it reproduces.


Three, two, one, zero.


[ball whooshes]


[students shout out answers]


Lower? STUDENT: H igher.


LEWIN:  Higher! So it was 10 centimeters,  five centimeters higher so we'll take 
seven. 
So we'll make seven and we'll have to allow for an uncerta inty. 

So h max... is about 3.07.


I've done this this morning 20 times and there were times that the heights d iffered

by more than 10 centimeters, sometimes even 15 centimeters.


I therefore would feel most comfortable if you a llow me an uncertainty of 15

centimeters in that height.


Remember, once we start shooting at 30 degrees, there is no way that we can

eva luate the velocity anymore.


We have to just take this value at face value.


This is the way we've measured v zero, and that's it.


This is a five percent error, five percent.


So what now is v zero squared? Well, that's easy to ca lculate now.


V zero squared equals 3.07 times 2 times 9.8...


Oh, my calculator was off; that's a detail.


Um, 3.07 times 2 times 9.8--


that is 60.17.


I'd like you to check that.


60.17 plus an error of five percent.


That  is an error of three so you might as well make this 60.2.


Would you please confirm that, that I didn't make a mistake? 3.07 is h max--


I multip lied by two, by 9.9, and 60.2 There's a five percent error and a five percent

error is indeed three.


This is meters squared per second squared.


I don't care what v zero is because  if we are going to measure OS all I need is v zero

squared.


And if you at home are going to calculate what the height will be at the various

angles all you need is v zero squared.


So I am not even interested in v zero.


I'll just stick to v zero squared and v zero squared will have exactly the same

uncerta inty.


It will have an uncertainty of five percent because it comes immediately from h.


We are not going to change that.


Okay, so, so much  for the uncertainty in v zero squared.


Now I'm going to set the ang le at 45 degrees but how accurately can I do that? I

don't think I can do that any better than one degree.


I'll try to do the best I can.


I can't rea lly guarantee you that I'm accurate to one degree.


So now comes the question what happens w ith the sine of two alpha because we're

going to measure OS? What happens with the sine of two alpha? The sine of 90

degrees is 1.0000.


But what would be the sine of 88 degrees? That is the value that I cannot exclude if

I'm off by one degree.


And that value is 0.9994.


That  is so close to one that it is only off by 0.6%... 0.06 percent.


And that is so low, compared to five percent, forget it.


Forget the error in alpha.


We can completely forget it.


There's a reason for that.


When a lpha is 45 degrees, then 2 alpha is 90 degrees and the sine curve goes like

this at 90 degrees.


It's almost flat here.


So even if you're off an angle by a little b it you're still very close to one--


that's the reason.


So a ll we have to worry about is the uncertainty in v zero squared.


And so now comes my big prediction.


I'm going to make a prediction now: for 45 degrees, OS equa ls v zero squared.


We have that.


That  is 60.2.


And we have the sine of two alpha is one and we d ivide by 9.8.


That  is 6.14 meters with an uncerta inty of five percent, right? Because that is the

uncerta inty in v zero squared and so there is an uncerta inty of 30 centimeters,

actually 31 centimeters.


This is my prediction for an angle of 45 degrees.


This will only hold if there is no air drag or if the air drag is negligible, and of course,

equa lly important, that that spring gun--


when the ball comes out--


that the velocity squared is indeed w ithin the range that we have assumed and that

it doesn't have bad days and good days.


There's no way I can check that anymore.


All right, so we're going to mark the .614.


This is one meter, two meters, three meters, four meters five meters, six meters,

6.14.


One four... 14 centimeters.


Boy, God, it's all the way here.


And then I a llow  for an error of about 30 centimeters.


Did I do that right? That is correct, 45 degrees with 30 centimeter uncertainty.


That  is all the way up to here.


And then the next one, roughly 30 centimeters.


So that's where, if our ca lculations make sense that's where the ba ll should hit.


Now I would like you to come here, if you don't mind.


Stand here, and the moment that that ball hits...


[whooshes]


point your finger at it.


Don't do it before I shoot, but just after I shoot.


And then we'll hope for the best, yeah? Okay.


You're not nervous, right? Where... what happened with that ball that I had? Did  I

put it in my pocket? 
Oh, it's here. 

Thank you.


So I'm going to set it now, to the best I can, at 45 degrees.


And so I can never shoot it any further, this is the ang le...


this is the maximum possib le d istance.


You ready? You are? Don't look at me, look there.


It goes fast.


Three, two, one, zero.


[gun clicks]


LEWIN: Put your finger there!


[class  laughs]


Isn't that fantastic? Isn't that amazing? Do you see now how important it  is that you

have uncertainties in your measurements? In high school, you would have sa id it has

to hit there.


Boom, man, it has an error.


[class  laughs]


And the error has to be taken into account.


Where's my ba ll, by the way?

Boy...


Oh, I have it, ooh, here.


[grunts]


Okay, you can sit down now.


You did great.


It worked just because you were there.


[class applauds]


Now I wonder what happens if I fire the ba ll at 30 degrees? If I do it at 30 degrees,

then my v zero squared is the same.


I don't have to worry about that, I hope.


However, I cannot be certain about the ang le to better than one degree.


So you w ill say, "Well, come on now, don't be decadent.


"I mean, here we had an error of only 0.06 percent "because of this one degree...


possible one degree offset.


Let's just ignore this error, too." Ooh... that is risky.


That  is risky, now because the sine of 60 degrees--


that's what you deal w ith--


the sine of 60 degrees, I think, is 0.866.


That's right.


But the sine of 58 degrees which is possib le if I'm one degree under ~ is 0.848, and

that is  substantially lower.


And therefore I must allow for an uncerta inty in the sine of the ang le by roughly, oh,

maybe something like 17 or 18 units--


0.0... what is this d ifference? 0.018.


If you want to check what the sine of 62 degrees is you w ill see that that is about

this much higher than this so we must allow for this error.


And that is an error which is by no means neg lig ible anymore.


There's no point here.


That  is an error which is 18 divided by 866.


That  is a two percent error.


So now we're dealing, all of a sudden with a  two percent error in the sine of two

alpha even though there is only one degree of uncerta inty in the angle.


And the reason is that a sine curve is like so.


So a sma ll ang le change here makes no difference but a sma ll ang le change here

makes a lot of d ifference.


And that's the reason and you can see that it is the slope of the sine curve that gives

you a much larger error if you are off by a teeny-weeny, little bit.


So now we are ready to make a prediction.


So here comes the pred iction.


OS now for 30 degrees...


So I have to go through v zero squared--


I have that, 60.2 and then I have to multiply by the sine of two alpha that is,  the

sine of 60...


multip ly...


and then I think I have to divide by g.


That  is right, 9.8, and I find 5.31, p lus or minus.


Now, two percent error in the sine of two alpha five percent error in v zero squared

that gives me--


I can't help it--


a seven percent error.


So I have a seven percent uncertainty, multiply by .07 so I cannot trust this any

better than 37 centimeters.


And so now I'm going to put the markers out at five meters and 31 centimeters.


This is the five-meter mark, 31 centimeters and I a llow  for 37 centimeters on either

side.


It's here... and 37 centimeters on this side, that is here.


I'm going to set the angle to 30 degrees.


Yeah, yeah, come here.


We need woman power here.


[class  laughs]


Stay here.


Stay out of the fire line, and when that ball hits you jump on  it, yeah, you jump on

it.


Okay, everything under control Five... make sure I marked it right, five meters,

three one,  that looks about okay.


And now I have to change the ang le to 30 degrees.


[grunts]


Okay, this is as close as I can do it.


Okay, you ready? You are? Three, two, one...


[ball whooshes]


[Lewin shouts]


Lew in: Hit the jackpot!


[class cheers and applauds]


Incred ible.


What you can argue now, and successfully--


you could say perhaps you have been a little too conservative on your errors, and I

admit that.


But believe me when I did this morning this five, six times that the error in v zero

was quite substantia l.


The high d ifferences were sometimes 15 centimeters and so I had no choice.


But it looked like we were a bit on the conservative side.


Suppose, now, I repeated this experiment at 60 degrees.


What will change?

What will change? W ill OS change? No, because the sine of 120 degrees is the same

as the sine of 60 degrees.


You have two alpha here.


The sine of 60 is the same as the sine of 120.


If you allow for an uncertainty of one degree on either side  you will find exactly

these same numbers because of the symmetry of the sine curve.


So aga in, you are off by two percent--


no d ifference.


And so this pred iction is unchanged.


However, I want to ask you one question to see whether you are half-alert or ha lf-

asleep.


At 30 degrees, you saw this.


At 60 degrees, giving it the same initial speed you w ill see this.


It will have to hit here within the uncerta inty of our measurements at the same

location.


It will, of course, go much higher.


You can ca lculate that because you w ill have to use this for the equation  for the

height and that goes w ith the sine of alpha.


The sine of alpha for 60 degrees is way higher than 30 degrees.


But now comes a question--


will this trajectory take longer than this one or will they take the same amount of

time? Who is for the same amount of time?

Who is for longer? Who  is for shorter?

Okay.


I am happy with one set of figures and unhappy with another set of figures.


What is the horizonta l velocity of the golf ba ll when it takes off? If the velocity is the

same in both cases can't you see that this horizonta l component is way larger than

this horizonta l component? And if they travel the same d istance then this trip must

take longer because it's the horizonta l component in the x d irection that determines

how long  it will take to go from here to there.


Suppose I shot it stra ight up.


How long do you think it w ill take to hit here?

It has no horizonta l component, all right? So think about this--


this trajectory will take longer but it ends up at the same point.


All right, number three.


Can you come here? So I don't have to change these markers.


They're all perfect provided that nature is willing to reproduce  itself.


60 degrees...


So he'll go way higher, but if a ll goes well, it should hit w ithin the same marks.


Ready? Three, two, one, zero.


[ball whooshes]


[ball whacks table]


LEWIN: Here, man.


Yeah, here, right? Thank you very much.


Wonderful! Look! Maybe my uncertainties were not so dumb.


We were just lucky here w ith the jackpot.


It's comfortab ly within the error, but close to this one so I am quite happy that I

took the uncertainties the way I did.


Can we recover the ba ll? Did someone see it take off? Oh, yeah.


All right, now we will enter a d ifferent part of this lecture.


which is actually a very... a very sad part.


You know that people in Africa shoot monkeys.


There  is a monkey here in a tree--


very happy.


[class  laughs]


LEWIN: And here is a hunter...


who never took 801 and he has a gun, which is a golf ball gun and he a ims that gun

right at the monkey.


He shoots it with a certain velocity, the golf ball.


Let this be speed v zero, so the horizontal component--


you're going to see that again and again--


v zero cosine alpha and  the vertica l component equa ls v zero sine alpha.


Let this be my increasing value of y and this be my increasing value of x.


This golf ball...


this... this golf gun, is rea lly not first-class, thank goodness.


And so when the hunter shoots this golf ba ll, this happens.


And it ends up here at point p.


Lucky monkey, so  far.


Now, it is very trag ic but true that when the monkey sees the flash of the gun, it lets

go.


[class  laughs]


And now comes the question--


is the monkey safe or is this the  last day of the monkey?


[class  laughs]


I ask the following question.


This would be trajectory with no gravity and this is the trajectory with gravity.


We can both agree on that.


At a certain moment,  t1, let us assume that the golf ball would have been here

without gravity.


Then I know exactly where it is w ith gravity.


It must be exactly here because the x position, xt1, is the same because the

horizontal velocity is the same.


That's independent of whether there is gravity or not.


There  is no acceleration in the x direction.


And so they are both exactly at the same x position.


What is this difference? Well, that is the difference between the equation with gravity

and w ithout gravity.


And y as a function of time--


you can look at equation number three there if you can still see it--


equa ls v zero y, which is v zero sine a lpha time t minus one-half gt squared.


Well, if there is no gravity, this term doesn't exist because that's this straight line.


[whooshes]


With gravity, it's the same thing but you have to subtract this.


Therefore, this d istance is one-half g t1 squared.


That  is this d istance so this curve is lower by this amount.


Now comes the time that the golf ball hits point p.


When its position  is x t2 and the time here is t2 that means if there had been no

gravity the golf ball would have been there.


They must have the same position in x at this catastrophic moment.


So what now is the d istance between the monkey and the golf ba ll--


the d istance between the two trajectories--


one trajectory, no gravity; the other with gravity? This distance equals one-half g t2

squared for that same reason.


And we all know that if the monkey at time t equals zero let go that in t2 seconds it

will have fa llen exactly over a distance one-half g t2 squared--


exactly.


This couldn't be more tragic.


And he w ill be killed.


You may say, "Well, yeah, but you have manipulated the speed of that gun just so

nicely." Oh, no. Oh, no.


I can shoot that with a higher speed at the same angle alpha and the trajectory

would be this and the monkey would be killed there.


I can do it w ith a lower speed and the monkey would be killed here.


It's independent of the speed of the bullet because a lways this part here--


it's a lways exactly the distance that the monkey fa lls in that time.


However, if the speed is very low--


that it hits the ground before the monkey hits the ground--


well, okay, then the monkey is safe.


So the only thing that  is very, very critical is a lpha.


It must be precisely aimed at the monkey.


If that's not the case, then the monkey w ill be safe.


Now before we will witness this classic and  rather tragic drama, I want to look at this

from a somewhat d ifferent point of view namely from the point of view of the

monkey.


The monkey sits there, looks at the gun and the golf ball comes to  the monkey.


And I will put them both in a room which is an elevator and the elevator is in free fall

and they don't even know that.


They both fa ll w ith the acceleration g.


Here is the monkey, free and here is the gun.


The velocity of that bullet is v zero.


And so the monkey w ill see that bullet come straight at him.


There's no such thing as an arc.


They both fa ll in this falling grav...


in this falling elevator.


And so the bullet comes...


[kisses]


The monkey happens to be a very intelligent monkey and the monkey says to

himself, "How long do I have to live?" And the monkey makes the following

calculation.


[class  laughs]


LEWIN:  If this d istance is d, and this is h, then the monkey says "Aha, this is the

square root of d squared p lus h squared." So from the monkey point of view, the

time for the kill w ill be the square root of d squared p lus h squared divided by v zero.


That's how many seconds he has to live.


Well, you people are also quite smart and you look at this d iagram and you sa id,

"No, no way." If this distance is D then the speed to reach this point is v zero cosine

alpha.


In other words, the time that it takes for this ob ject to reach this value of x...


So, for 26.100 MIT students t kill equa ls D divided by v zero cosine a lpha.


But what is the cosine of a lpha? That is D divided by the square root of D squared

plus h squared.


So I can replace this cosine alpha by D d ivided by the square root.


So I can replace this cosine alpha by D d ivided by the square root.


And you and the monkey agree exactly on the amount of time that the monkey has

to live.


It better be that way, because this could not depend on which reference frame you

work in--


the falling reference frame or, for that matter the reference frame of 26.100.


The monkey will be placed at about three meters above the tab le.


We all know that  it takes about 0.8 seconds.


We have done many experiments at three meters.


It takes about 0.8 seconds.


So the whole thing will go very fast.


We are going to put a monkey up there.


I want you to  first see the trajectory of that golf ball before we bring the monkey in.


It is a lready so pa inful for this monkey.


You don't want him to pre-experience what's going to happen.


So we will do this in the absence of the monkey and we will let you...


I w ill let you see what roughly the trajectory of that bullet will be.


Three, two, one, zero.


[gun claps]


[ball bouncing]


So it will hit somewhere here.


That's that point p.


So when you're going to see the drama in action this is where the monkey will reach

when the two hit each other.


Now you can imagine that this is a very pa inful day for the monkey.


And I'm going to get the monkey.


It's behind here and I hope that you would pay some respect to Robert.


His name is Robert, and it may take me a minute.


[class murmurs]


[class cheers and laughs]


LEWIN: Here is Robert.


[laughter continues]


I thought...


[class applauds]


LEWIN:  I thought it was appropriate to change for the occasion.


I don't go on monkey hunts too often but when I do  it, I'd like to do it in style.


[class  laughs]


Here is Robert, and we're going to put Robert up here.


Robert has in his head a meta l plate... 

so that when we activate the electromagnet that we can stick him on there  and 
when we take the current off, then Robert w ill fa ll. 

So this is the activation of the electromagnet. 

So here we go. 

I can see Robert is nervous. 

[class  laughs] 

And you can't blame him. 

This is not the greatest day of his  life. 

[class  laughs] 

Oh, by the way, I want you to know we are not cruel here. 

He's wearing a bulletproof vest. 

[class  laughs] 

Oh, boy, I can... I can  feel him shaking a ll over his body. 

He's very nervous. 

Robert, don't let go yet! Oh, let me show you. 

It's important that you know that we have done everything we can to aim this gun as

accurately as we can at Robert.


Robert, don't let go yet.


We've got to  first cock the gun.


Hold it, now, hold it, Robert!


[class  laughs]


This happens always w ith Robert.


[laughter]


[Lewin admonishes Robert  in whispers]


[class  laughs]


Okay, he just promised me that he w ill not let go again.


When I cock the gun--


if I can find the golf ball, it's here--


then the electric circuit takes over  and now the current will be d isconnected when

the gun is fired.


Even I... even I'm nervous.


I admit it, you know, this is a terrib le thing to do.


Terrib le thing to do.


[sighs]


You ready? Three, two, one, zero.


[gun clicks]


[class exclaims]


[loud echo reverberates]


LEWIN: Poor monkey.


See you Friday.
