8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 22 

Today,  I will ta lk to you about ellip tical orbits and Kep ler's famous  laws. 

I first wan t to review with you briefly wha t we know about circu lar orb its , so I wro te on the 
blackboard everything we know about circular orbits. 

There's an ob ject mass little m go ing in a circle around capital M. 

This cou ld be the Sun ; it could be the Earth. 

It has radius R, circular . 

We know there in equa tion one how  to derive the time that it takes to go around . 

The way we found that was by se tting the cen tripe tal force onto little m  the same as the

gravita tiona l force.


Also , the velocity in orb it--


maybe I should say speed in orbit--


also follows through the same kind of reason ing .


Then we have the conservation of mechanica l energy--


the sum o f kinetic energy and po ten tial energy .


It's a cons tan t; it's no t changing.


You see there  first the component o f the kine tic energy, which is the one-half mv-squared , and

then you see the term which is the po ten tial energy .


We have de fined potential energy to be zero a t infinity, and tha t is why all bound orb its have

negative total energy.


If the to tal energy  is positive , the orb it is not bound.


And when you add these two up , you have an amazing coincidence tha t we have discussed

before .


We ge t here a very simple answer.


The escape ve locity you find by setting this E  tota l to be zero, so th is par t o f the equation is zero .


Out pops that speed with which you can escape  the gravita tiona l pull of capital M, which is the

square roo t o f two  times larger than this V.


And I wan t to remind you tha t for near Earth orbits, the period to go around the Ear th is about 90 
minu tes, and the speed-- this velocity,  then , tha t you see in equa tion two--

is abou t eigh t kilometers per second , and the escape velocity from that orbit would be abou t 11.2 
kilome ters per second. 

And for the Ear th going around the Sun , the period wou ld be about 365 days, and  the speed of 
the Ear th in orbit is about 30 kilome ters per second , jus t to refresh your memory. 

Now, c ircular orbits are special. 

In general, bound orbits are e llipses , even though I must add  to it that most orbits o f our p lane ts 
in our solar system--

very close to c ircular, bu t not precisely circular .


Bu t the genera l solutions call for a e llip tical orbit.


And I first wan t to discuss with you the three famous  laws by Kepler from  the early 17th cen tury.


These were br illiant sta temen ts tha t he made .


The interesting thing is that be fore he made these brilliant s ta tements , he published more

nonsense than anyone e lse.


Bu t fina lly he arrived a t two ... three go lden eggs .


And the first golden egg then is that  the orbits are ellipses--


he talked always abou t plane ts-- and the Sun is a t one focus.


That's Kepler's  law number one .


These are from around 1618 or so .


The second...


Kepler's second law  is--


quite bizarre how he found tha t ou t, an amazing accomplishment.


If you take an ellipse, and you pu t the Sun here at a focus--


this  is highly exaggera ted because I  told you tha t mos t orbits  look sor t of circular--


and the planet goes from here to here in a cer tain amount of time, and you compare tha t w ith  the

plane t go ing from here to here in a cer tain amoun t of  time,  then Kepler found out  that if this area 
here is the same as tha t area here, that the time to go from here to here is the same as to go 
from there to there. 

An amazing accomp lishmen t to come up with tha t idea .


And th is is called "equal areas, equal times."

Somehow , it has the smell o f some conservation of angular momen tum.


And then his third law was tha t if you take the orbital period o f an e llipse , tha t is proportional to 
the third power o f the mean dis tance to the Sun . 

And he was so pleased w ith  tha t result tha t he wrote jubilan tly abou t it. 

I will show you here the da ta tha t Kep ler had availab le in 1618 , largely from the work done by , o f

course, as tronomers, observers  like Tycho Brahe and others.


You see here the six plane ts tha t were known a t the  time, and the mean distance to the Sun .


For the Earth , it is one because we work in astronomical un its .


Everyth ing is re ferenced to the distance of the Ear th.


This  is 150 million kilome ters.


And it takes the Earth 365 days to go around the Sun;

Jupiter , about 12 years; and Sa turn, about 30 years.


And then when he takes th is number to the power of  three and this number squared, and he

divides the two, then he gets numbers which are amazingly cons tan t.


And that is his third law .


The third law  leads immed iate ly to the inverse square dependence o f gravity, which he was no t

aware o f, bu t Newton later pu t tha t all together.


Bu t he very  jubilantly writes:

And he wrote  tha t in 1619.


So , orb its  in genera l are ellipses.


And now I wan t to review with you what I have there on the blackboard abou t e llipses .


You see an ellipse  there?

Capita l M-- cou ld be the Earth , could be the Sun--


is at loca tion Q.


The ellipse has a semima jor ax is A, so the dis tance P  to A-- perigee to apogee-- is 2a .


If M were the Ear th , cap ita l M,  then we would call  the point of closes t approach "perigee ," and the

point farthes t away from the Earth , we would call that "apogee ." If capital M were the Sun , we

would ca ll tha t "aphelion" and "per ihelion." So you see the little m going in orbit;

you see the position vec tor r of q .


It has a cer tain velocity v .


And so the tota l mechan ical energy  is conserved .


The sum of kine tic energy and po ten tial energy doesn' t change.


The first  term is the kinetic energy-- one-half mv squared, and the second term is the po ten tial

energy--


no different  from equation three for circular orbits, except tha t now capital R , which was a fixed 
number  in a circle, is now a little r, and little r changes, of course , with time. 

Also that velocity, v, in that equation number five will also change with time because it's an 
ellip tical orbit. 

It will no t change in time in equation number two and in equa tion number three. 

Now I give you a result wh ich I d idn' t prove , and that is that  the to tal mechanica l energy, which 
has these two terms  in it which you do fu lly understand, also equa ls minus mMG div ided by 2a, 
and a is the semimajor axis. 

And compare number five with number three , then you see they are bro thers and sis ters.


The only change is tha t what was capital R before is now little a , the semimajor axis .


And if you wan t to calcula te the time to go around  the e llipse , then you get an equation for T

squared, which is almost identica l to number one for the circular orbit, excep t tha t now the radius

has to be replaced by a , which is the semima jor ax is.


And the escape velocity you can calcu late in exac tly the same way that you calcula te the escape

velocity under equa tion number four.


All you do is you make the  tota l energy zero , and then you solve equa tion  three and equa tion  five,

and ou t pops the speed  tha t you need to make it a ll the way out to in fin ity .


And that is  in the case of the circu lar orb it, square roo t of two times the speed in orbit.


So these are the numbers that we are going to use today, the equa tions.


And there's one thing wh ich is already qu ite remarkable and very non intuitive-- very nonin tuitive ,

to say the least.


That if you have various orbits which have the same semimajor axis,  that  the period is the same 
and the energy  is the same, and that's by no means obvious. 

So , this  is one orb it-- th ink o f it as being an ellipse--


and this  is another one.


This d istance is the same as this distance.


I've just done it tha t way .


That means , according to equa tion five and six, that bo th orbits have exactly the same

mechanica l energy, and bo th orbits have  the same periods.


So to go around  this c ircular orbit will take the same amoun t of time as to go around this one , and 
that is by no means obvious. 

I now want to start with a very general in itial condition o f an ob ject, little m, in orbit... in an e llip tical 
orbit. 

And I wan t to see how we can ge t all the informa tion about the ellipse that we would like  to find

out.


So I'm only giving you the in itial conditions .


So here is an ellipse , here is P and here is A.


If th is is an ellipse around the Ear th, then th is wou ld be perigee and th is wou ld be apogee .


The mass  is cap ita l M,  this  is po int Q.


Let me ge t a ruler so that I can draw some nice lines.


So the dis tance AP equals 2a-- a being the semimajor axis--


and our object happens to be here-- mass little m--


and this distance equals R zero .


Think of it as being time zero.


And at  time zero , when it is there, it has a velocity  in that e llipse .


Let this be v zero .


And there is an ang le between the position vector and v zero; I call that ph i zero .


So I'm giving you M, I'm g iving you v zero , I'm giving you r zero , I'm g iving you phi zero.


And now I'm going  to ask you , can we find out from these initia l cond itions how  long it  takes for

this objec t to go around? Can we find out wha t QP is? Can we find out wha t the semimajor axis

is? Can we find out wha t the velocity  is a t poin t P, a t closest approach when th is angle is 90

degrees? And can we find out wha t the velocity  is when the object, little m, is far thes t away--

apogee? Can we find all these things? And the answer  is yes. 

a is the easies t to find-- the semimajor axis.


I turn to equation number five , wh ich is the conserva tion of mechan ical energy.


And the conserva tion o f mechanical energy says that the tota l energy is the kinetic energy plus

the potential energy equals one-half mv zero squared .


That is when the object is here at loca tion D minus mMG div ided by this r zero at loca tion D .


This can never change.


This  is the same throughout the whole orbit, so it must also be , according to equation five , minus

mMG divided by 2a .


And so you have one equation with one unknown , wh ich is a, because you know all the o ther

things : M cancels... M always cancels when you deal w ith gravity , so you only have a as an

unknown.


So tha t's done .


If the to tal energy were positive, then for th is to be positive, a has to be negative.


That's physical nonsense, of course , so th is on ly ho lds for bound orbits.


So positive va lues for E  tota l are no t allowed.


Once you have a , you use ...


so th is is from equa tion number five.


If you now apply equa tion number six, immedia tely pops out T, the orbital periods, because the

only thing you didn' t know ye t was a , but you know a now.


So we also know how long it  takes for the object to go around in orbit.


And I try to be quantita tive with you .


Step by step, as we analyze this further , I will app ly this to a specific case for someone going

around the Earth .


Everyth ing I'm telling you today, includ ing all numerical examples, are in a handou t wh ich is six

pages thick, which  I wro te specially for you .


It will be on  the Web .


We're no t going to print it here-- tha t's a waste o f paper .


It's 1999 , so that's wha t we have the Web for.


So you can decide on your own how many... how much notes, how much time you want to spend

on no tes, and  to what ex tent you wan t to concen trate and try to follow the steps .


It's up to you .


Bu t every thing is there--


litera lly every thing , every numerica l examp le.


We take for capital M...


we take the Earth , and tha t is six times ten to the 24 kilograms .


So tha t's my M.


I promised you you will know M.


I will give you r zero.


That is 9,000 k ilometers.


That's the location at poin t D.


I g ive you  the conditions at D .


The speed at point D  is 9 .0 k ilometers per second , and I'll give you phi zero is 120 degrees.


Everyth ing else we should be able to calcu late now from these numbers.


First of all, with equa tion five, you can conv ince yourse lf s ticking in these numbers that the to tal

energy is  indeed nega tive.


Of course, if I make the to tal energy positive, it's no t an ellipse, so then it's a ll over.


It is nega tive; it is an ellipse .


So with equation number five , I then pop out a .


Right? Because that's one equa tion with one unknown, and I pu t in the numbers--


you can confirm them and check them at home--


and I find  that a is quite large .


a is abou t 50,000 kilometers .


That's huge .


That is almost in fin ity , no t quite .


Remember , it star ts o ff a t 9 ,000 kilometers , bu t a is 50 ,000 kilome ters .


That means 2a is 100,000 kilometers .


Why is that so large? Well, the answer lies in eva lua ting the escape velocity .


The escape ve locity o f this  little mass when it is at position D , for which these are  the inpu t

parame ters, is the square roo t of 2MG divided by r zero , and tha t is 9 .4 k ilometers per second .


Well, if you need 9.4 kilome ters per second to make it out to in finity, and you have nine kilometers

per second , you're pre tty close already .


So tha t's the reason why this semimajor axis  is indeed such a horrendous number .


It's no surpr ise.


If now I use equa tion number six,  then I find the period, and I find tha t it  takes about 31 hours for

this objec t to go around the Ear th.


So far , so good.


Now we wan t to know what  the situation is with perigee and with apogee .


Can we calculate the d istance QP? Can we calculate the speed a t location P and a t location A?

And now comes our superior knowledge .


Now we're going to apply for  the firs t time in systems  like th is, the conserva tion o f angular

momen tum.


Angu lar momen tum is conserved abou t this point Q, bu t on ly about  that po int Q.


It is not conserved abou t any o ther point, but that's okay.


All I wan t is tha t poin t Q.


That is where capital M is  loca ted .


What is the magnitude o f tha t angular momen tum? Well, let's first take point D.


When the object is a t D, the magnitude of the angular momen tum is m  times v zero times r zero

times the sine of ph i zero .


This  is the s itua tion a t D.


Why do we have a sine phi zero? Because we have a cross between r and v, and with a cross

product, you have the sine o f the angle .


So tha t's the situation at po int D.


What is the situa tion at po int P? Well, at po int P, the ve locity vector  is perpendicu lar to the line

QP, so the sine of that ang le is one .


So now I simply get m times v of P times the dis tance QP.


And you can do the same for poin t A.


You can write down m times v o f A times QA.


I'm no t doing that.


You will see shortly why I'm no t doing that.


Nature is very kind .


Nature's going to g ive me that las t part for free.


This, by the way , is the conservation o f angular momen tum about that po int Q where the mass  is

located .


I have here one equation with two unknowns-- v o f P and QP--


so I can't solve .


So I need ano ther equa tion.


Well, o f course, there is ano ther one .


We have also  the conservation o f mechanical energy .


So now we can say tha t the total energy mus t be conserved, and the tota l energy is one-ha lf...


I do it at point P--


equals one-half mvP-squared-- tha t is the kine tic energy--


minus mMG d ivided by the dis tance , QP.


This  is the potential energy when the d istance be tween capital M and little m is QP.


With this number, we know...


because tha t is minus MG d ivided by 2a.


That's our equa tion number five.


Oops! I slipped up here.


You may have no ticed it.


I dropped a little m which should be in here .


Sorry for tha t.


And so now we have here a big moment in our  lives that we have applied bo th laws .


This  is the conservation o f mechanical energy .


And now I have two equations with two unknowns--


QP and v o f P-- and so I can so lve for both .


Notice that th is second equation is a quadratic equa tion in v o f P.


So you're going to ge t two solu tions, and the two solu tions--


one, v o f P will g ive you  the distance QP.


The other one will be vA, wh ich g ives you the d istance QA.


How come tha t we get bo th so lutions? Well, this is only a s tupid equation.


This equa tion doesn' t know tha t I used a subscrip t P.


I cou ld have used a subscrip t A here and put in here QA.


That's the term tha t I left out.


And therefore , when I solve the equations,  I get bo th vP and vA because those are  the s itua tions

that  the velocity vec tor is perpendicular to the position vector.


And if I use now our numerical results, and I solve for you that quadratic equation--


two equa tions with two unknowns--


then I find tha t QP-- you may want to check tha t at home--


is abou t 6.6  times ten to the third ... three kilometers .


It means tha t it's only 200 kilome ters above the Earth's  surface.


At  that low a ltitude , th is orbit will no t last very long , and the sa tellite w ill reen ter  into  the Earth's

atmosphere .


And it leads to a speed at poin t P, at perigee, o f 10.7 kilome ters per second .


My second solu tion then is tha t QA turns out  to be huge.


No surprise because we know tha t the semimajor axis  is 50,000 kilometers.


We find 9 .3 times ten  to the four kilometers , and we  find for v of A, th is value is 14 times larger

than th is one, and so the velocity w ill be 14 times sma ller.


I think  it's 0 .75 kilome ters per second .


Yes,  that's wha t it is.


Immed iate result--


the conservation o f angu lar momen tum--


that  the produc t o f QP and vP mus t be the same as QA times vA.


That's  immedia te consequence o f the conservation of angular momen tum.


And when I add this up, QA plus QP, I better find 2a , which in our case is about 100 ,000

kilome ters, because a was 50,00 kilometers .


So when you add these  two up, you must find very close to 100,000, and indeed you do.


So now we know every thing  there is to be known abou t th is ellipse , and tha t came from the initial

conditions from the four numbers that I gave you .


We know the period , we know where apogee is, we know where perigee is, we know the orbital

period--


anything we wan t to know .


Now I wan t to ge t into a subject which is quite d ifficult, and it has to do with change of orbits.


Burning a rocket when you are in orbit and your orbit will change.


And I will do it only for some simp lified situations.


I s tart off with a circular orbit, and I w ill fire the rocket in such a way ...


that  I w ill only fire it in such a way tha t my velocity w ill e ither  increase exactly tangen tia lly to the

orbit, so that it w ill increase in th is d irection or that it w ill decrease in th is direc tion .


So if  I'm going in orb it like  this,  I e ither fire my rocket like th is, or I fire my rocke t like this , but that

is difficu lt enough what we do now .


So th is is our circu lar orb it with radius r, and at loca tion X, a t 12:00, that is where I fire my rocke t.


The first  thing  I do , I increase the kinetic energy .


So I fire my rocke t, I blast my rocket, we go in this direc tion .


I b last my rocket in this d irection, and so the speed wh ich was or igina lly this  in orbit--


the speed will now  increase .


I add kinetic energy , and now I have a new speed which is higher .


If my speed is higher, then my to tal energy has  increased.


I increased the kine tic energy.


The burn o f the rocke t is so short tha t I can consider after the burn  tha t the objec t is still at X.


It's a very brie f burn.


So the kine tic energy has  increased ;

the potential energy  is the same, so the tota l energy is up.


And therefore , the total energy now  is larger than the to tal energy tha t I had in my circular orbit.


Bu t if tha t's the case,  then clearly 2a mus t be larger than 2R .


I now go in to an elliptical orbit because the new velocity is no longer the righ t velocity for a

circular orbit.


And so what's going to happen--


I'm going to ge t an ellip tical orbit like so, whereby 2a must be larger than 2R because my tota l

energy is  larger .


And you see tha t immed iate ly when you go  to equa tion number five .


If you increase the  total energy, then your a will go up.


Okay, so 2a is  larger than 2R.


That also means tha t the per iod T mus t be larger than  the period in your circular orbit.


Fine .


So far , so good.


My o ther op tion is tha t I'm going to fire the rocke t when I spew ou t gas in this direction , so I  take

kinetic energy ou t.


So after the burn , my speed is  lower .


My speed is now  lower.


I have taken kine tic energy out.


When I take kine tic energy out, the total energy  is go ing to be less than the circular energy , 2a 
will be less than 2R, and the orbital period will be less than the circular orbital period , and 
there fore, my new ellipse will look like this . 

And so these are the  three situations tha t I want you to carefully  look at because I'm go ing to 
need them in the nex t very dramatic story which has to do with the romance be tween Peter and 
Mary. 

Pe ter and Mary are two astronauts , and they are both in orbit in one and the same orbit around 
the Ear th . 

This  is where Pe ter is a t this momen t, a t tha t loca tion X, and this  is where Mary  is. 

They are in exac tly the same orb it, but different sa tellites. 

They go around like th is, and they are at a dis tance from each o ther which I will express in terms

of a  fraction F o f the total circumference , so that this arc equals F times 2 pi R.


That's how far they are apart.


And that means for Mary to make it all the way back to point X would be one minus F times 2 pi

R. 

So far , so good.


Mary forgo t her lunch, radios Peter and says, "Peter , I have on food ." Peter feels very sorry for

her, says , "No swea t.


I will throw you a ham sandwich." So Pe ter prepares a ham sandwich and wan ts to throw it to

Mary in such a way tha t Mary can make the ca tch.


How can Peter possibly do this? Well, the bes t way, the most obvious way to do it is to make an 
orbit for the ham sandw ich whose orb ita l period is exac tly the same as this time for Mary to make 
it back to X. 

And I will be more specific by giving you some numbers.


Then you can digest that be tter .


Suppose  they are in an orb it with a rad ius o f 7,000 kilometers.


And suppose F equa ls .05 , so the separation between Pe ter and Mary  is 2 ,200 kilome ters.


So tha t is F times 2 p i R .


If you know the radius R , then , o f course, the ve locity o f the astronauts fo llows  immedia tely .


You have all the too ls there.


So with R equals 7 ,000 kilome ters,  the astronauts-- a now stands for astronau ts--


is a given , nonnego tiable , and tha t is about 7.55 kilome ters per second . 

7.55 kilome ters per second .


And wha t is also nonnego tiab le is the period to go around, which is 97 minu tes .


All o f tha t fol lows from this R.


Okay, if it takes 97 minutes to go around, then five percent of 97 minu tes is five minutes , if I round

it off.


So th is takes five minutes to go.


95% o f 97 minutes  is 92 minutes .


So for Mary to go around and go back to poin t X is 92 minu tes, rounded-o ff numbers.


So if  I can give my sandw ich an orb it which has a period of 92 minu tes,  I've go t it made because

after 92 minu tes, the sandwich will come back to X and Mary  is at X.


It's  important that you ge t tha t idea.


If you get  that idea,  then all the res t w ill follow .


So the period of the sandwich after the throw o f Peter--


maybe he has to throw backwards .


If that period is 92 minu tes, when Mary is here , she will catch the sandwich.


And so the necessary condition for this first solu tion , which is an obvious one , is to make the

period of the sandwich--


S s tands for sandw ich-- to make that one minus F of the period o f the as tronau ts in orb it.


This  is the 97 minutes ; this  is .95 , so this  is 92 minu tes and this  is 92 minu tes .


So then Mary w ill be back a t poin t X.


What is the orbital period of the sandwich after the throw? We ll,  that is 4 pi squared--


you can find tha t in equa tion number six--


times a to the th ird d ivided by MG to the power one-half.


That must be equa l one minus f times the orbital period of the astronauts who are in circular orb it.


So I take equation number one, and  that is four p i squared, R cubed d ivided by GM  to the power

one-half.


That is a necessary condition.


Look, we lose M, we lose G, we lose four , we lose p i.


What don' t we lose? Well, wha t we don't lose is a  to the power three-halves equals one minus f

times R to the power three-halves.


So a equals R times one minus f to the power two-thirds.


And th is is an amazingly simple result.


It means  if you know the orbit of Peter and Mary, which is R , and if you know how far the two

lovers are apart, which is expressed in this f, then you know wha t the semimajor axis  is o f the

sandwich orb it.


That comes immed iate ly ou t of  this equa tion .


Bu t once you know the semimajor axis , you can immed iately calculate , with equation five , the

speed o f the sandw ich.


Because if equation number five will tell you that minus mMG div ided by 2a--


a being now the semimajor axis o f the sandw ich orb it--


equals one-half m times the ve locity o f the sandwich squared.


This happens at loca tion X after the burn--


after  the burn means a fter Peter has thrown--


minus mMG d ivided by capital R , because the sandwich is s till a t location capital R, bu t Pe ter has

changed the speed  to vs .


And so once you know a , this equa tion immedia tely gives you vs , and once you know vs, then

you know with what speed Peter shou ld throw .


Well, let us work it out in de tail in the examp le tha t we have there.


If we calcula te a w ith  the numbers tha t we have  there, which you can easily confirm because you

can app ly this equa tion for yourself--


you know wha t f is, you know what R  is.


Then I find tha t a is 6 ,765 kilome ters.


Notice that th is is smaller than R .


It be tter be , because it's clear tha t after the sandw ich is thrown, that we ge t a green ellipse .


We want th is time to go around to be less time than Peter to go around.


And if this time is  less than the time tha t it  takes Pe ter to go around , he has to throw  the sandwich

backwards, and there fore , you expec t tha t the semimajor axis w ill be sma ller than R , and it is . 

The speed of the sandwich , wh ich follows then from equation number six, wh ich was the 
conservation o f mechan ical energy, is 7.42 kilometers per second . 

Now, what ma tters  is not so much wha t the speed o f the sandwich is , but wha t ma tters for Pe ter 
is wha t is the speed tha t he will have to g ive the sandwich, wh ich is v o f s minus v o f a, and that 
you have to sub tract the speed--

v of s is the speed of the sandwich, v of a is the speed of the astronau ts in orbit. 

This  is minus 0.13 kilometers per seconds. 

And the minus sign indicates that he has to  throw the sandwich backwards. 

So quite amazing . 

He is seeing Mary all the way  in the dis tance , and in order to ge t the sandwich to Mary, he

doesn't do th is, but he does this--


[whooshes ]


And the sandwich then will go into this new orbit, going still forward.


92 minu tes  later, it's here , and Mary ...


Oh, we were here.


So he goes forward .


92 minu tes  later, the sandw ich is here .


92 minu tes  later, Mary  is r ight a t tha t poin t and can make the ca tch.


Now, .13 kilome ters per second is 300 miles per hour, which is a little tough , even for Peter .


And so we have  to look for different solu tions .


This won't work.


This was an easy one , bu t it doesn't work.


Well, there is no reason to rush.


We can make the sandwich go around the Earth two times and Mary three times, or Mary two

times and the sandwich on ly once .


As long as they meet at po int X, there is no prob lem.


So we have a who le family o f solutions.


We can have Mary pass tha t poin t X na times, and we can have the sandwich pass that po int X

n-sandwich times.


As long as these are integers, that's perfectly fine.


Then ultimate ly, if they have enough pa tience , they will mee t a t poin t X.


And if you take these ...


this new concept in to accoun t tha t you can wait a cer tain number of passages through X, then the

equation tha t you see  there--


the rela tion be tween a and R--


changes on ly slightly.


You now ge t tha t a equals R  times n o f a minus f divided by ns to the power two-thirds.


And if you substitu te in here a one and a one, wh ich is the case tha t they make the catch righ t

away, then you see indeed you ge t R (one minus f) to the power two-th irds.


So tha t's exactly wha t you have there.


Not all solu tions that you try w ill work.


One so lution tha t won' t work  is na equals one and ns equals three has no so lution .


And I'll leave you w ith  the thought why that is the case.


Has no solu tion .


In 1990 , when I lectured 8 .01 for the firs t time , I asked my friend and colleague George Clark to 
write a program so tha t I could show the class this toss of the sandwich with Mary and Pe ter in 
orbit and the sandwich orbit and every thing and  the catch, and he d id. 

It was a wonderful program, bu t tha t program no  longer works because  tha t's called progress.


The compu ters have changed and so, my right hand , Dave Pooley , o ffered to rewrite the program

so tha t it works on Athena , and we were going to demonstrate it to you, and you can play with it

yourself.


It is availab le on the homepage, so whatever Dave is going to show you, you can do yourse lf.


The inpu t parameters tha t we need for this program are the rad ius R , our f and our n o f a and our

n of s.


And the program will do a ll the rest, so you can specify how many times you want Mary to go

through point X, how many times you want the sandwich to go  through point X.


The program will then calcu late for you the speed of  the sandwich .


It will a lso g ive you vs minus va , wh ich is really the speed with which Peter has to throw  it, but

very cleverly, the program works w ith a dimensionless parame ter which is this value .


And th is value, which is vs divided by va minus one is a number tha t is qu ite un ique , because you

get so lutions which turn ou t to be independen t of capita l G and independent o f cap ita l M, and I'll

give you an example .


Suppose you will find  for this ...


for this dimensionless number, suppose you find minus 0.0175 , wh ich is the so lution for n one ...


na is one and for ns  is one.


So you'll see tha t.


The compu ter will generate tha t number for us .


If now we take our orbit o f 7,000 k ilometers...


we know wha t v of a is, and so we can calcu late now that vs minus va is the va times that

number .


Bu t we know wha t the va is, it's 7 .5, so you get minus 0 .175 times 7 .55 k ilometers, and lo and 
behold , tha t is our minus 0.13 kilometers per second. 

Of course! It has to be tha t number, because  that's wha t we calculated for our case , n equals 
one. 

There it is. 

And so this dimensionless number is very transparen t, and we will show you some examp les. 

This would be the 300 miles per hour , which, o f course , is not very doable . 

Dave, why don't you demonstra te the program? And then you'll see wha t we can do with that

program.


We can substitu te in there quite a few parameters that you will find no doubt in teresting.


Give us an explanation, Dave , of wha t the students can do with this .


Oh, le t me show them an overhead here which wou ld help you in  follow ing wha t Dave will be

telling you.


You see there  the f value?  It's always 5% we  took, and you're going to see here the numbers

for...


the number of times that Mary passes through poin t X and the number of times that  the sandwich

will pass through point X.


This  is that very first case tha t we worked on toge ther .


Here, you see  that number minus 0.017, and you see indeed tha t it is a successful ca tch .


So le t's work at that first.


David, expla in how  it works.


DAVID : Okay, well, you can see in  the middle o f the screen is planet Earth , and these two

triangles represen t the as tronau ts.


The ye llow one is Mary and the red one is Peter , and he's hold ing the sandw ich right in the

midd le.


They s tart o ff at a radius o f 22 ,000 kilometers from the center of the Ear th.


That's the defau lt, but you can change that if you'd like.


And we set na and ns through these pulldown menus, so we'll set  them both to one and one now. 

And we ask the program to ca lcula te the value for us o f th is dimens ionless parameter, and it 
comes up w ith it, and we wan t to use tha t va lue . 

And so we have every thing set... 

LEW IN : That's this number, righ t, Dave? Th is minus 0 .0175, e tc. 

DAVID : Yep, it's righ t over here. 

So then we ask the program to prepare the toss . 

We click th is bu tton down here , and when it's ready,  the green play bu tton w ill become active . 

And when that happens, we can c lick on  that, and it'll play the toss for us . 

LEW IN : Pe ter a lways throws at X, 12 :00 . 

DAVID : Always a t 12:00. 

LEW IN : There goes the sandw ich. 

You see the sandw ich? Grea t sandwich. 

Big sandwich .


So notice tha t the sandw ich makes  it around exac tly at  the same  time--


[exclaims]


for Mary to be happy .


Now there's no reason why we shouldn't try one , too .


So tha t means Mary reaches poin t X, bu t the sandw ich went twice around the Earth .


There is no prob lem with th is solution in pr inciple , bu t you have to be qu ite  far away from  the

Earth.


If you're too close to the Earth like Dave's orbit, which has a radius of only 22 ,000 kilome ters,

something very ca tastrophic w ill happen.


DAVID : Yeah, okay , so now we want  to se t ns to two , and we do that with the pulldown menu .


And we ask it to prepare the toss again , and it goes through its numerical calcula tions o f the orbit.


And when it's ready , it'll let us know.


And now we can watch the toss.


LEW IN : So there goes the sandwich .


It wan ts to go around the Ear th twice , but it h its the Ear th.


That's too bad.


If you make  this dimension less parame ter minus one, then v of s is zero .


And wha t does it mean tha t v o f s  is zero .


That  the sandwich stands still, has no speed in orb it anymore.


And so what happens w ith  the ellipse, that becomes radial infall.


Dave? DAVE: Okay, so if we wan t to use our own va lue for  this dimension less parame ter,  then

we can go to this box righ t here and pu t in whatever we wan t, so we'll pu t in minus one .


And we make sure that the program is going  to use our value ins tead of  the ca lcula ted value .


In this case, these numbers don't matter-- na and ns .


They're irre levan t, because the program is going to use our va lue .


We ask  it to prepare...


LEW IN : The minus one overrides every thing else now .


DAVID : Yes .


It's going  through its calcu lations, and now we can see what happens.


LEW IN : 12 :00 , there goes the sandwich .


Now, Pe ter decides a t one poin t tha t instead o f throw ing the sandwich backwards, he can also

throw the sandw ich forward , because, look, we have here the red ellipse .


There's no reason why Mary couldn't go tw ice through X--


one... tw ice.


And then the sandw ich would make a larger ellipse and meet here when Mary has gone around

twice.


Then , o f course, the sandwich has to be thrown  forward.


And so Pe ter makes a ca lcula tion for what we ca ll the 2 /1 situa tion .


Mary goes twice through X;

the sandwich goes once through X.


Bu t Pe ter made a mistake .


Pe ter go t nervous, and he pu ts  in the wrong parame ters, and you will see wha t happens.


Dave will first show you the right parame ters.


DAVID : Okay, so if we would have asked the program  to calcula te it for the case of 2/1, it would 
have come up w ith a value for this dimension less parameter o f .1659 or someth ing thereabou ts. 

Bu t, you know, Peter made his miscalcula tion , and he wants to use .164, so this  is what we'll put 
into the program, and we'll prepare  the toss and see what happens with th is value. 

Okay, now  it's ready.


LEW IN : Poor Mary must be hungry by now.


There we go.


Now we go forward.


You can see tha t.


You see, it goes forward .


It goes a very  large ellipse , and Mary will go around  twice.


When Mary  is here, see , the sandwich is only halfway.


And if Pe ter had only done it righ t, Mary's troubles wou ld now soon be over.


Bu t Pe ter made  this small mis take, and ...


[students  laugh]


And Mary canno t catch it.


If you make  this dimension less parame ter plus .42 , then it's very easy to convince yourself that

the sandwich-- mus t be a plus--


will have the escape velocity from the orbit.


Maybe Peter go t angry a t one poin t at Mary--


you never know abou t these situations--


and he  threw  it very fast, and Dave w ill show you what happens then.


DAVID : Okay.


LEW IN : And it goes to infinity, and it won't be fresh anymore when it ge ts there .


Okay, see you Friday.
