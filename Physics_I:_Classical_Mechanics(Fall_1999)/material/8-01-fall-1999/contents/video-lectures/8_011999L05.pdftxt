8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 5 

Today we w ill discuss what we call "uniform circular mo tion ." What is uniform circular motion? An

object goes around in a circle, has radius r and the object is here .


This  is the ve locity.


It's a vec tor, perpendicular .


And la ter  in time when the object is here the velocity has changed , but the speed has not

changed.


We introduce T, wha t we call the period--


of course it's in seconds--


which is the time to go around once .


We introduce  the frequency, f, which we ca ll the frequency which is the number of rotations per 
second. 

And so the units are e ither seconds minus one

or, as most physicists will call it, "her tz" and so frequency is one div ided by T.


We a lso introduce angular velocity, omega which we call angular velocity.


Angu lar velocity means not how many me ters per second

but how many radians per second .


So since there are two p i rad ians  in one circumference--


in one full circle--


and it takes T seconds to go around once it is  immedia tely obvious tha t omega equals two pi

divided by T.


This  is something that I wou ld like you to remember.


Omega equals two pi divided by T--


two pi radians  in capital T seconds.


The speed, v, is , o f course, the circumference two pi r d ivided by the time to go around once but

since two p i d ivided by T is omega you can also write for th is "omega r." And this  is also

something that I wan t you to remember.


These two things you rea lly want  to remember .


The speed is no t changing, bu t the velocity vec tor  is changing .


Therefore there must be an acceleration .


That is non-negotiable .


You can derive wha t tha t acceleration mus t be in terms of magnitude and in terms o f d irection.


It's abou t a five , six minutes der ivation.


You'll find it in your book .


I have dec ided to give you the results so  tha t you read up on the book so that we can more  talk

about the physics rather than on the derivation .


This acce leration tha t is necessary to make the change in the velocity vector  is a lways poin ting

towards the cen ter o f the circle .


We call it "centripeta l acceleration." &nbsp; Cen tripe tal, poin ting towards the cen ter.


And here , a lso poin ting towards the center.


It's a vec tor.


And the magn itude of the cen tripe tal accelera tion equals v squared divided by r , wh ich is this v

and there fore it's also omega squared r.


And so now we have  three equa tions and those are the only three you really wou ld like to

remember.


We can have a simp le example .


Let's have a vacuum c leaner , wh ich has a rotor ins ide which scoops the a ir ou t or in, whichever

way you look at it.


And le t's assume tha t the vacuum cleaner these scoops have a rad ius r of about ten cen time ters

and tha t it goes around 600 revolu tions per minu te, 600 rpm.


600 rpm would translate into a frequency, f, of 10 Hz so it wou ld transla te in to a period going

around in one-tenth o f a second .


So omega , angular velocity, which is two pi divided by T is then approximately 63 rad ians per

second and  the speed , v , equals omega r  is then rough ly 6.3 me ters per second .


The centripeta l acceleration--


and tha t's really my goal--


the centripeta l acce leration would be omega squared r or if you pre fer, you can take v squared

over r.


You will ge t the same answer, o f course, and you w ill find that  that is abou t 400 meters per

second squared .


And that is huge .


That is 40 times the acceleration due to gravity.


It's a phenomena l acceleration,  the s imp le vacuum cleaner.


Notice that the acceleration,  the centripeta l acce leration is  linear  in r.


Don't th ink tha t it is inversely proportional with r .


That's a mis take , because v  itself is a func tion o f r .


If you were sitting here then your veloc ity would be lower.


Since omega is the same for the en tire motion you rea lly have to look at  this equa tion and you

see that the cen tripeta l acceleration is propor tional with r.


Therefore, if you were ...


if this were a disc wh ich was rotating and you were a t the cen ter o f the d isc the cen tripe tal

acceleration would be zero.


And as you were to wa lk ou t, further out, it would increase.


Now, the accelera tion must be caused by some thing.


There is no such th ing as a free lunch.


There is some thing that must be responsib le for the change in this velocity and tha t some thing I

will ca ll either a pu ll or I w ill call it a push .


In our nex t lecture , when we deal with New ton's laws we will introduce the word " force." Today we

will only deal with the words "pull" and "push." So there mus t be a pu ll or a push .


Imagine that this  is a turn tab le and you are sitting here on the turn table on a chair .


It's going around w ith angular velocity omega and your distance to  the center , let's say, is  little r .


You're sitting on  this chair and you must experience--


that is non-negotiable--


centripe tal accelera tion A of c, which is omega squared times r.


Where do you ge t it from? We ll, if your sea t is bo lted to the  turntable then you w ill feel a push in

your back so you're sitting on this thing, you're going around and you will fee l tha t the sea t is

pushing you in your back and so you feel a push, and  that gives the push ou t.


Yeah , I can give this a red co lor for now.


So you feel a push in your back.


That push , apparen tly , is necessary for the accelera tion.


Alterna tively , suppose you had in  front o f you a stick .


You're no t sitting on a cha ir.


You don' t get a push from your back .


Bu t you hold onto the s tick and now you can go around by holding on to the s tick.


Now the s tick  is pu lling on you in th is same direction .


So now you would say, aha , someone is pu lling on you .


Whether it is the pull or whe ther  it is the push one o f... either one o f the two is necessary for you

to go around in tha t circle on tha t turn table with that constant speed.


Now, the classic question comes up , which we often ask to peop le who have no scien tific 
background. 

If you were to go around like  this and some thing is either pushing on you or  is pu lling on you to 
make this possib le suppose you took tha t push out, all of a sudden.


The pull is gone .


[makes whoosh ing sound ]


What is now the motion of  the person who is sitting on the turntable? And many non-scientis ts

say, "We ll, it w ill do like this." Tha t's sor t o f wha t your  in tuition says.


You go around in a circle, and a ll of a sudden you no longer have the pull or the push and you go

around in a spira l and obviously , tha t is no t the case.


What will happen is , if you have, a t this momen t in time a ve locity  in this d irection and you take

the pull or the push ou t you w ill star t flying o ff in  that direction and depending upon whether there

is gravity or no gravity there may be a change , bu t if  this were...


if there were no gravity you would just continue to go along tha t line and you would no t make this

crazy spiral mo tion .


I have here a disc, wh ich we will ro ta te and at the end...


the edge of  the disc here we have a little ball.


And the ball is a ttached to  that disc with s tring .


So now th is is vertica l, and so this  is going  to go around with angular velocity omega.


And we have a s tring here and the s tring is a ttached to  this ball and the whole thing is going 
around and so a t one momen t in time th is has a velocity, like so . 

And therefore  there mus t be non-nego tiable centripetal acceleration wh ich in magnitude is omega 
squared r or, if you wan t to , v squared divided by r . 

Now I cu t it and that's  like taking away the push and the pull. 

The s tring that you have here is prov iding the pull on th is ball. 

This ball is fee ling a pull from the s tring and that provides it with the cen tripe tal accelera tion. 

Cut the string and the pu ll is gone and the object will  take off. 

And if there were gravity here , as there is in 26 .100 it would become a parabola and it would end 
up here . 

If, however,  I cu t the ball exac tly when it is here--

not the ba ll, bu t I cut the s tring--

then , o f course, it would fly stra ight up gravity would act on it, it wou ld come to a halt and it wou ld 
come back. 

So it really would then go a long a s traigh t line . 

Bu t you wou ld clearly see , then tha t it's not go ing to do what many people th ink--

that it would star t to swirl around . 

It would just go... 

[makes whoosh ing sound ] 

and comes back. 

Let's  look a t that. 

We have  tha t here . 

So here is tha t ball. 

The s tring is behind here; you canno t see the s tring . 

I will rota te it, wait for  it to p ick up a little speed and the knife , tha t you can' t see either , is behind

here and when I push the knife in, I do it exactly here .


It cuts the s tring and it goes up .


You ready for th is? You sure you're ready? Three , two , one, zero.


Wow! That was very high .


So you see , it's no thing like this .


It simply continued on in the direction tha t it was going .


It wasn' t go ing in to a parabola because I was shoo ting it s traigh t up.


The s tring forms the connection be tween the rota ting d isc and the ball and there fore , the pull is

responsible for the cen tripeta l acceleration.


Let's now think about planets .


Planets go around the sun .


There's no s tring , so who is pushing? Who is pu lling? Well, it's clear tha t it must be gravity .


It must be the sun that is pulling on the planets .


Now, I realize  that  the orbits o f p lane ts are no t nicely circular so it's not really a uniform circu lar

motion .


We will deal with orbits in grea t detail in a few weeks--


circular orbits and ellip tica l orb its .


Let us jus t assume for simplicity now that the orb its are roughly circular jus t to ge t a little bit o f

feeling for  it.


And you can look up now in your book--


which I d id for you--


even in your preliminary version you can look up what the mean dis tance of the p lane ts is to the

sun and you can look up what the period is the time to go around the sun.


The time to go around the sun is no t the same for all planets.


The plane ts are no t attached  to a  turntable .


Anywhere , any person on a turntab le would go around in the same amoun t o f time .


We know that  that's no t true for planets .


It takes the Ear th a year to go around the sun .


It takes Jupiter 12 years to go around so don' t make  the mistake to think that omega is the same

for a ll plane ts.


That's no t true .


So I look up the d istance--


the mean d istance  to these various planets--


and you see that here in millions o f k ilometers.


Notice that Mercury is abou t 100 times c loser than Plu to.


By the way,  this  is on  the Web , so don' t copy this.


You will find this on the 801 home page .


Then I looked up how many years it takes to go around the sun--


12 years for Jupiter, one year for the Ear th--


and I looked up all the o ther values .


Then , since  I know the periods , I can calcu late omega .


Omega is two p i d ivided by T, so I know omega .


And then I take omega squared times the mean distance to  the sun and this  is, o f course, the

centripe tal accelera tion .


So the plane ts experience this centr ipe tal accelera tion in some crazy units, but who cares abou t 
the units here? And no tice that Mercury, which is 100 times closer than Pluto has a centr ipetal 
acceleration wh ich is 10 ,000  times larger than Plu to. 

100 times closer has a 10,000 times  larger centripetal acceleration. 

So wha t I d id was I p lotted this data , the cen tripe tal acceleration versus the mean dis tance to  the

sun and I did tha t on log paper.


And wha t immed iate ly s trikes...


is very str iking is tha t a ll these po ints--


I've done them for all  the plane ts--


they fall on a stra ight line.


And so what is the slope o f tha t line? Well, I tried various slopes and I found that the slope is

very, very close  to minus two.


Here is the slope o f minus two , and I can over lay this and no tice that the fit is absolute ly stunning.


Therefore, you canno t escape the conclusion  that  the centripe tal accelera tion wh ich is the resu lt

of gravity , falls o ff as one over R squared .


We re fer to th is, often , in physics as the "one over R square" law .


And therefore , the e ffect of gravity itself mus t go down with R squared.


So if you are 100 times fur ther away  like Pluto compared to Mercury then the grav ita tional...


the centripeta l acce leration which is due to gravity is 10 ,000 times smaller .


And we will learn a lo t abou t gravity  in the future.


We will just leave it for now .


If you took the sun away , it wou ld be like cu tting the str ing that provides the pull and in  tha t case

what you would see is tha t the planets would jus t take off along a s traigh t line .


They would continue to go .


They wouldn' t have anything to pull on  them anymore .


Now le t's  look a t an objec t tha t we're go ing to ro tate .


I have a glass tube tha t I wan t to ro ta te and in the g lass tube, I have a marble .


The glass tube is very smooth .


I have here  the glass tube .


Here's a marb le.


I'm going to rota te it in this direction say, with some angular veloc ity omega abou t an ax is

perpendicular to the blackboard.


So the marble here has a ve locity like so , a t this moment in time bu t it's a very smoo th glass tube

and the marble is very smoo th .


The glass cannot push on the marble nor can the g lass pull on the marb le.


Now, the marble ge ts desperate because the marble needs a centr ipetal acceleration in th is

direction in order to go around like this .


Bu t there is noth ing to provide tha t cen tripe tal accelera tion.


So the marble is doing exac tly the same tha t the planets would do if you take the sun away.


The marb le con tinues to go in the direc tion  that it was going.


So by the time that  the tube is here , the marble is here and by the time tha t the  tube is here the

marble is there.


So the marble  finds  its way to the edge and tha t's, o f course the bas ic idea behind a centr ifuge.


My grandmother had always...


She was a grea t lady and she had such fan tastic  ideas, I remember.


And when she made lettuce we had no good way of drying the le ttuce and I wou ld take the

lettuce and go like this ... paper towel.


She had a me thod o f her own.


She took a colander and, o f course , first o f a ll we would wash the le ttuce, that goes withou t

saying.


I would wash it once .


My grandmother wou ld wash it three times but that's what you have grandmothers for.


So there comes the le ttuce.


We were also very fond o f sp inach, so add some spinach.


We would wash it...


there goes the spinach.


Then she would take something to cover  it up--


maybe some Saran wrap , or something else--


put it over  it and pu t a rubber band around it to hold it.


And now wha t she's going to do , she's going to sw ing it around .


And now the wa ter  is  like these marbles .


The water will work  its way to  the edge bu t there are ho les, so  the water will come ou t.


Isn't she c lever? Okay, I'll g ive you a demons tration.


Be carefu l or you may ge t some wa ter on your  lec ture notes.


Bu t I want to show you the basic idea behind it is very  interesting .


She would go ou t... she wou ld do this ou tside , by the way.


Bu t I have no cho ice, so I w ill do it here.


So there we go .


[class laughs]


You see? This  is the way you dry...


Oh, I los t my magnetic strawberry--


that's a de tail in the process .


So you end up w ith ...


you end up with dry and clean and n ice lettuce .


This  is 801 a t work and  this  is clear ly an early version o f a cen trifuge.


Now, my grandmo ther's me thod , very trag ically has been replaced late ly with someth ing that you

can buy at Cra te and Barrel.


We have it here.


Um, it is very boring .


It's very decadent.


Pu t the salad in here and all you do is you ro ta te and it dries.


It's a cen trifuge .


This  is ac tually a high- tech version of the much more sophistica ted invention o f my grandmo ther .


And it's nowhere nearly as exciting .


The days o f romance are really over but  that's the way it goes.


I'm now going to make a connec tion be tween ro tation on the one hand and centr ipetal

acceleration on the other.


I'm going to make a connec tion be tween cen tripe tal acceleration and perceived gravity .


The way tha t you perceive gravity.


I'm going to pu t you in various positions and then ask you wha t is the direc tion of gravity.


I'm going to create ar tificial gravity for you .


And le t's first do it as fo llows .


I first hang you on a string .


There you are , like th is.


And I ask you , do you feel a push or a pu ll? And you say, "Yeah , I fee l a pull." And you feel a pull

in this direction.


So now I ask you "Ah, in wha t d irection do you perceive gravity?" and you think I'm crazy.


You're righ t in tha t case , but never theless you say "Gravity is  in this d irection." The o ther direction

is the pu ll.


Okay, so  far, so good .


So now I'm going to put you just standing on the floor and I say to you , "Do you fee l a push or a

pull?" And you say, "Yeah , I feel a push .


I feel a push from the  floor up." So I say, "In wha t d irection do you perceive gravity?" You say,

"Well, come on, don' t be boring .


Gravity  is in this direction ." No tice in bo th cases you te ll me  tha t gravity  is a lways in  the opposite

direction o f either your pull or your push.


Okay, now I'm going to be a little rough on you.


Now I'm going to swing you around on a s tring jus t as  if you were an apple and I'm going  to do

this w ith you .


And you're at the end of the apple .


You are the app le, no t at the end.


You're at  the end of the s tring .


You are the app le.


So there you are .


Here... poor you.


[class laughs]


And I say, "Do you feel a push or a pu ll?" And you say, "Yeah , I do, I  feel a pull." Fine , in what

direction? " I feel a pull in  this direction ." Okay , so now I say to you "In wha t d irection do you

perceive gravity?" And you say, "Well, in the opposite d irection as pull." So now you perceive

gravity  in this direc tion which is very real for you . 

Now, in this par ticular case since the direc tion changes all the time--

since I swirl you around--

you will, o f course , get dizzy  like hell, but that's a detail. 

You will perce ive grav ity  in th is direc tion when you're here and when you're here you will perceive

gravity  in tha t direction.


So you perceive gravity  in the d irection wh ich is opposing the pull and the fas ter I ro ta te you, the

stronger w ill be the pull and therefore  the stronger will be your perceived gravity.


A carpenter wou ld use a plumb line and the carpen ter would just hold the plumb line like this .


The pull is  in this direc tion and so the carpen ter says "Okay, perceived gravity is  in that direc tion ."

The carpenter happens to be righ t in this case.


Gravity  is in this direction , but it's the same idea.


The plumb line is being used  to find  the direction of gravity.


Think of this as being a plumb line to find ...


used to find  the direction of gravity.


Now you're in ou ter space .


You're going to play Cap tain Kirk and you're in a space station and there is no gravity .


So we're going to make some gravity for you.


We're go ing to crea te some artific ial gravity .


So le t this be your space sta tion; it's a big whee l, a radius of about 100 meters and we'll make it

very fancy for you.


We'll make some corridors around, like here .


We'll make it a very  interesting space station like so ... and like so .


And th is is rotating around with angular velocity omega.


You're here--


there you are.


You go around .


Therefore, non-negotiable you're going around with a certain velocity v .


This v equa ls omega r and therefore , you require centripetal accelera tion towards the cen ter--


that is non-negotiable .


Where do you ge t it from? We ll, the floor--


this  is your floor--


is pushing on you .


Simple as tha t, just like the floor  is pushing on me now.


This floor  is pushing .


There's noth ing wrong with tha t; I don' t fa ll over.


And so I say to you , "In wha t d irection do you perceive gravity?" And you say, "This  is the

direction o f gravity" which is as real for you as  it can be .


Someone else is standing here .


What do you th ink tha t person will th ink if I ask tha t person "Wha t is the direction of gravity?"

Exactly , radially ou twards , opposing the push from the floor.


So we could now calcula te how fas t we have  to ro ta te this space ship to mimic the gravitational

acceleration on Ear th--


which is 9.8 me ters per second squared .


Let's ca ll tha t 10, jus t to round it o ff a little.


So we want  the people who wa lk around in this corridor to have an accelera tion omega squared

R which is abou t 10 so omega squared is abou t 0 .1 so omega is abou t 0.3 radians per second .


And so the period to go around is abou t two pi divided by omega and that is abou t 20 seconds .


And the tangential speed--


that value for v , which is omega R--


would then be 0 .3 times 100 would be about 30 meters per second just to give you an idea  for

these numbers wh ich are by no means so ridicu lous.


What is  interesting, that the perceived gravity--


and there fore the cen tripe tal accelera tion--


is zero here.


There is no thing; there is no gravity there .


And so tha t may be a good place for you to have your sleeping quar ters.


Now comes an interes ting ques tion .


You can walk around here withou t any prob lem.


Could you wa lk into these spokes? So when you were here, could you then wa lk towards your

sleeping quar ters? When you were s tand ing here and I firs t ask you " In wha t d irection is gravity?"

And you will say, "Well, gravity is  in this d irection." Can you now walk to your sleeping quarters?

And wha t's the answer? You cannot. 

You canno t walk up agains t gravity. 

It would be like asking you to wa lk to the ceiling . 

How do you do tha t? An e levator or a s taircase , tha t's fine because  then you get the push from

the s tairs when you step on the s tairs.


So you cou ld have the sta ircase here and tha t's the way this person could go here .


Bu t you canno t simply wa lk here because gravity  is a lways in this direc tion .


Now le t's suppose you are a t your sleep ing quar ters and you wake up in the morning and you

decide to go back e ither  in  this direction or this direction or this direc tion or tha t direction--


it doesn't matter .


Could you do tha t, jus t by ...


just going in to th is corridor and slow ly, carefu lly s tarting mov ing? Wha t would happen? Yeah?

STUDENT: You would  fly out.


LEW IN : You would fly out.


It would be suicide, because  the momen t tha t you are here already, you have maybe no t a very

large grav ita tional experience bu t a lready  it's beg inning to grow on you.


The far ther out you are,  the s tronger  it w ill be .


By the time you're here , it's 10 me ters per second squared.


Remember? We had 10 meters per second squared because we wan ted to mimic the Earth and

so you literally crash.


It's  like fa lling in to a shaft, jump ing into a sha ft.


It's not qu ite the same because you star t o ff w ith no pull on you .


The momen t you s tart going, however the s itua tion gets out o f hand and indeed you will slam.


So you can use the same eleva tor .


You can use the same s taircase.


There's noth ing wrong with tha t.


Suppose  I have a liquid which has very, very fine, small particles  in it--


extremely small, so small and so ligh t that they will not sink to  the bottom.


So you w ill always see some colored milky-type liquid .


And here is tha t tube wh ich has these fine par ticles .


And the tube is sitting there and the line of the liquid is obviously  like this .


Why? Well, tha t's obv ious.


Because gravity is  in th is d irection.


And so the surface o f the liquid is a lways perpendicu lar to gravity.


You see here two glasses with water .


The sur face is perpendicu lar to gravity .


Now I'm going to rota te th is about this ax is--


it's going around like this--


and I'm go ing to rotate it w ith an angu lar ve locity omega and this is a t a dis tance , R .


Therefore, there is now a centr ipetal accelera tion in th is direction, and so the particles now say

"Aha! Gravity  is  in this direc tion ." The s ide of the g lass and the liqu id is push ing in th is direc tion  to

provide this centr ipetal acceleration . 

So if you ask them, "Where is gravity?" they w ill say "Gravity is there." And this gravitational e ffect 
can be so much stronger than this one tha t you can forget this one--

you will see  that in a minu te. 

You can comp letely forge t this one . 

And so the liquid will say " I'm go ing to be perpendicular to gravity." And so the liquid w ill go like

this, clunk .


While it ro ta tes around the liquid in th is tilted tube w ill be vertica l.


Bu t no t only that, the par ticles tha t are here experience now way s tronger gravity  than they did

before so I have made them heavier .


They are no longer  ligh t particles.


They are heavy par ticles, and what do heavy partic les do? They have no problems in making it to

the s ide.


The reason why the ligh t particles cou ldn't  fall in the firs t p lace has to do w ith  the fac t tha t the

molecu les o f the liquid due to their temperature , have a chaotic mo tion .


We call tha t the "thermal ag ita tion." And these molecules would in terac t w ith these very sma ll and

light par ticles and so the light par ticles would never make it  to the bo ttom.


The thermal agita tion now o f the liquid is the same--


the tempera ture doesn' t change--


but the par ticles have become way, way heavier and so the particles now go in the direction of

gravity which is here .


And wha t you will see, if these particles are wh ite you will see wh ite precip ita tion there and the

liquid will become clear.


And that is some thing tha t I would like  to demonstra te to you .


Bu t be fore I do that, I wan t to give you some numbers.


Here we have a household, simple , noth ing-specia l cen trifuge tha t is used in any  laboratory .


The centrifuge that we have has an rpm which is 3600  rpm.


So 3600 rpm transla tes  into a frequency of 60 Hz.


So it goes around once in one-sixtie th of a second .


Omega is two p i times  f is there fore roughly 360 radians per second.


360 rad ians per second .


If we assume  tha t the radius  is...


maybe it's 10 , 15 cen time ters.


Whatever , let's take a radius o f 15 cen time ters.


And we can ca lcula te now what the centripeta l acceleration is .


And the cen tripe tal accelera tion a o f c which is omega squared R  is then roughly abou t 20 ,000

meters per second squared .


20,000 meters per second squared .


And that is 2,000 times the gravita tiona l acceleration.


It means tha t these par ticles experience gravity which is 2,000 times s tronger than if I don' t rota te

them.


And so they will go  to the side here .


Bu t the glass  itse lf is a lso 2 ,000 times heavier and therefore the glass can easily break so when

you design a cen trifuge like tha t you have to really  th ink tha t through very carefu lly--


that  the pieces tha t are in there don' t fly apar t.


I have here wa ter  in which I have dissolved some tab le salt--


the same  table salt tha t you use in the kitchen when you prepare your food, table salt in here .


Here I have wa ter  in which I dissolved some silver n itra te.


It's nasty stu ff, I warn you for  it, you have to be very careful because if you ge t the stuff on your

hands it burns through your hands very quickly without your realizing it and you end up with a

very black spo t.


It really ea ts away, burns out your skin.


Peop le put it on war ts and then  the warts , they think, fa ll o ff.


They probably do after a wh ile bu t your finger may also fa ll off.


So I have here silver nitra te and there I have sodium ch loride and I mix the two .


So I ge t table salt--


sodium chloride--

plus silver nitrate g ives sodium nitra te p lus silver chloride and  this, very small wh ite par ticles , and 
you will see  that  the liqu id turns milky ins tan taneously. 

It almost becomes  like , like yogurt, as you will see . 

And so I want  to show tha t to you. 

I have here  these two glasses. 

This  is the tab le sa lt and this is the silver n itra te . 

I'm going to mix them. 

I hope you can see th is. 

Here are the two glasses, and when I mix them... 

[whistles] 

instan taneously you ge t milk. 

[class laughs] 

Yeah . 

I'm no t asking you to tas te it bu t look a t it, r igh t? Jus t milk. 

You can leave th is for hours and hours and hours and it will just stay like  tha t. 

Very small par ticles o f silver chloride are in here. 

So now we are go ing to pu t this  in the centrifuge . 

I have to put it in a very small tube . 

I'll show you this sma ll tube. 

There's no way that I can pour that in withou t making a mess. 

Here's th is small tube and so what I will do is I will firs t put it in a sma ll beaker and then from  this 
small beaker I will trans fer it, some of it, to this tube. 

When you put th is in a cen trifuge your force on this glass is so high that you must always make 
sure that you balance it w ith another tube tha t you fill w ith water on  the other side . 

Otherw ise the th ing begins to shake like crazy. 

It's  like your cen trifuge when you dry your towels. 

If they are no t equally dis tribu ted it begins to make very obscene sounds and star ts to move . 

[class laughs] 

And the same th ing will happen here . 

So you just have to  take my word for  it that we have pu t on  the other side jus t some wa ter to

balance it ou t.


So here is now the yogurt and on  the other side is pla in water and we will just le t it sit  there for a

while and we will return to tha t shortly.


I men tioned a lready your cen trifuge for your clothes.


That is the way that you can dry your c lothes.


That is the same way tha t my grandmother dr ied the le ttuce.


The water will go to the circumference.


A household cen trifuge for your clothes would easily rotate 1,200 revo lutions per minu te have a 
radius maybe of 15 cen timeters which wou ld give you a centripetal acceleration of 200  times g , 
200 times the gravitational accelera tion.


So your clo thes experience gravity which is 200 times s tronger and therefore your clothes are

200 times heavier and there fore your c lothes can tear apart and we have a ll seen tha t.


We have all put in stu ff in a cen trifuge and when you take it ou t you're d isappointed because it's

torn.


That's because o f the tremendous grav ity tha t you have exposed them  to.


Many times when I  take my sh irts out, half my buttons are gone .


That's because the force--


I shou ldn' t use  that word ...


the gravitational effec t on the buttons  is enormous and they  just ge t ripped off.


Now I wan t to revisit the situation tha t you are on the end o f my s tring and I'm going to swirl you

around.


Earlier, I swirled you around like  this and you d idn' t like it and I don' t b lame you because you go t

dizzy.


Now I'm going to rota te you like th is.


You may like tha t better.


Maybe no t.


[chuckles]


And so, whe ther you like it or not  I'm going to tw irl you around and here you are .


This  is the c ircle.


There's a string--


you're here .


Here's the s tring and there you are .


You have a cer tain veloc ity .


Your velocity is  in this d irection and there is a cer tain distance to the cen ter, R .


And so you need a certain centr ipetal acceleration to go around in  tha t curve .


So you need a cen tripeta l acceleration a o f c--


which is ...


you can take the v squared divided by r , if you like tha t.


This  is the magnitude of that v.


Now follow me very closely .


Just imag ine tha t th is number happens to be exactly 9.8.


I can always do that.


Where is this person going to ge t the push or the pu ll from for th is cen tripe tal accelera tion? Does

the s tring have to pull on it? No , because there's always gravity and gravity g ives you an 
acceleration o f 9.8 meters per second squared . 

So the str ing says , "Tough luck,  I don't have to do any thing.


"Gravity provides me with the 9 .8 me ters per second squared tha t I required ." Now  I'm going to

swing you faster , so the v will go up and so the cen tripe tal accelera tion will go up .


The s tring will say "Aha! I'm going  to pull now on th is person "because the gravita tional

acceleration a lone is not enough--


I need some extra pu ll." So the string is go ing to tigh ten and pull on you .


And I say, "Hello, there, in wha t direction is gravity?" And you say, "Gravity is  in th is d irection."

Why? Because you fee l the string is pu lling on you in th is direc tion , so you experience gravity

there .


Now comes the ques tion , how real is this? Th is is very, very real.


It is so real  that if I took a bucket o f water  ins tead of you...


and here is the bucket of wa ter.


I a ttached to the bucket a rope.


I swing it around , and I swing it around such tha t the centripe tal accelera tion is substantially

larger than 9.8 so the s tring is definitely going to pull so if you were the wa ter , and I asked you , 
"Where is gravity?" you would say the gravita tional direction is in this direc tion and so the wa ter 
will say , "Okay, fine,  then th is will be my sur face and I want to go in this d irection." But the wa ter 
can't go in tha t d irection so it w ill jus t stay there . 

So I could swing  this thing around if  I do it fas t enough--

so fas t tha t the accelera tion a t this point here must be larger than 9.8--


the water will s tay up while the bucket is upside down .


How fast should  I ro tate it? We ll, le t's put in some simp le numbers.


I have here  this bucket and le t's say that th is is abou t one meter.


Let's round some numbers off.


So R is about one meter .


And I wan t v squared over R I want  that  to be larger than 9.8--


let's  just call it 10.


So tha t means v has to be larger than abou t 3 .2 meters per second.


The time to go around is two p i R divided by this velocity so this time to go around, then, has to

be six...


has to be less than two seconds.


So if  I swing this around in less than two seconds I will be okay .


Now, I realize  that  the speed when I move this thing around is not constan t everywhere.


That's very difficult to do tha t, because o f gravity .


Bu t it's close enough to ge t an idea .


So if  I ro tate this fas ter than in  two seconds when the bucket is upside-down if physics works, the

water should no t fall ou t.


So le t us fill th is with water.


There we go.


I'm always nervous abou t this .


Um, le t's first look a t the cen trifuge.


We have  to see whether the centrifuge has done its job .


So le t's look a t what this tube ...


I think  it was tube number four .


Oh, yeah ! Very c lear  is now  the liqu id and you see  the white stu ff here on  the s ide.


It's not  too easy for you  to see, really .


I pu t my hand under here.


Maybe some o f you can see some wh ite stuff but it's no longer milk--


really a clear  liquid .


Here you see some white stu ff here bu t it's also on the side.


You can actua lly see it here.


You see the white stu ff because this was the direc tion of gravity so it ended up here and  there's

some here.


It is comp lete ly clear.


You see the white stu ff? So that's the way that you can separate the silver chlor ide.


So now we come to this daredevil, daredev il experimen t.


And we're going  to see whether we can foo l the wa ter and make the wa ter think that gravity  is no t

in this direction but in  this direction.


Now, you're doing the right thing , there .


[class laughs]


I don't blame you at all.


[Lewin chuckling]


Okay...


There we go! You see the water is comple tely foo led and no tice that I go around subs tan tially

faster than in two seconds .


And the wa ter , when it's up there jus t thinks that gravity  is towards the ceiling .


Physics works.


Now, who is go ing to do this for me , too?


[class laughs]


Please , someone should try th is.


You th ink you can do it? Come on , try  it.


In the worst case, it will be a disaster.


[class laughs]


Okay, get some fee l for  it, but be fore you do it make sure that I'm out o f the way.


Bu t first swing it a little and don' t hold it too close to you because I don' t want you to ge t hurt.


Larger swing, larger , larger.


Now you ge t some feel for  it.


Go for  it, now! Yeah , faster!


[class laughs]


That was very good.


[class laughs and applauds]


See you Friday .


[applause]
