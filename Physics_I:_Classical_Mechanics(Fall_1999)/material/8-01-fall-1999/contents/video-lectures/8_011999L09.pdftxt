8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 9 

The exam on Wednesday w ill cover our first five lectures and the  first two homework

assignmen ts.


And so I list here the top ics the way we discussed them.


Of course, it is no t possible to discuss all o f them today but  I w ill make a selec tion .


I recall tha t we d iscussed scaling and we used the in teresting example o f Galileo Galilei--


an an ima l, and the animal has  legs.


And we defined the overall size o f the an imal as yea big--


we called tha t "s ." And then we said , well, there is here  the femur and the femur has length l and

thickness d .


It was comp lete ly reasonable to say well... that l will have to be propor tional to S.


If an animal is ten times larger than ano ther  its legs will be typica lly ten times  longer.


Since the mass of the animal mus t be proportional to its size to the power three it will a lso be

proportional to the leng th of the femur to the power three, and then came in th is key argument--


namely , you don't wan t the bones to be crushed .


Which is called "yie lding" in physics.


If I take a piece o f concrete , a b lock o f concre te , and I put too much pressure on it, it s tarts to

crumble .


And that's wha t Galileo Galilei may have had in mind .


And in order to pro tect anima ls who ge t bigger and bigger and bigger agains t this crushing , we

argued--


and I w ill no t go  through  that argumen t now anymore--


that  the mass will have  to be proportional to d squared , which is the cross-section o f the femur .


And so, you see immed iately tha t d squared has to be proportional to l to  the th ird so d mus t be

proportional to the leng th of the femur to the power one and a half.


So th is wou ld mean tha t if you compare an elephan t w ith a mouse the elephant's overall size is

about 100 times larger than a mouse.


You would expec t the  femur to be abou t 100 times  larger, wh ich is true.


Bu t you wou ld then expec t the femur to be about 1 ,000 times th icker and  tha t turns out to be no t

true, as we have seen.


In fact, the femur o f the elephan t is on ly 100 times thicker, so it scales  jus t as the size .


And the answer lies in the fac t tha t nature doesn't have to pro tect aga inst crumbling o f the bones .


There is a much larger danger , wh ich we call "buckling." And buckling is the phenomenon tha t the

bones do  this and if now you pu t too much pressure on it  the bones will break .


And if tha t's the case , you remember that, in fac t, all you have to do is you have to scale d

proportional to l, which is no t in tuitive--


that's no t so easy to derive--


but tha t's the case.


And so the danger, then, that na ture protects animals against is this buckling, and when  the

buckling becomes too much  then , I would imagine, the bones, at some poin t in time--


well, these are tough bones, aren' t they?--


[snaps]


will break, and that's wha t nature  tries to preven t.


So tha t was a scaling argument.


And le t's now  talk abou t dot produc ts.


If I look there...


I scan it a little bit in a random way over my topics , so let's now talk abou t dot produc ts.


I have a vector A...


Ax times x roo f, which is the un it vector  in the x direc tion, p lus Ay y roo f p lus Az Z roof.


So these are the three unit vectors  in the x, y and z direction .


And these are  the x componen ts, y and the z component o f the vec tor A.


I have another vector, B.


B of x, x roo f, B of y, y roo f, B of z, z roo f.


Now, the do t product...


A dot B--


also called the scalar produc t--


is the same as B dot A and it is defined as Ax Bx plus Ay By plus Az Bz .


And it's a number.


It is a scalar , it is a simple number.


And so this number can be larger than zero--


it can be positive--


it can be equal to zero , it can a lso be smaller than zero.


They're just dumb numbers.


There is another way that you can define...


You can ca ll th is method number one, if you pre fer tha t.


There is another way that you can find  the dot produc t.


It would g ive you exac tly the same result.


If you have a vec tor A and you have the vector B and the ang le between them is the ta , then you

can projec t B on A--


or A on B, for tha t ma tter , it makes no difference--


and tha t pro jection...


the leng th of this projection is then , of course, B cosine theta.


And so A do t B...


and tha t is exactly the same .


You may wan t to go through a proof o f tha t.


It is the length o f A times the leng th of B  times cosine o f the ta.


And that will g ive you precise ly the same result.


What is  interesting abou t this formula tion, which this  lacks, that you can immed iate ly see that if

the two are at 90-degree angles or 270 degrees , for tha t ma tter , then  the dot product is zero .


So tha t's an insigh t tha t you ge t through this one which you lack through tha t other method.


Let us take a down-to-earth example o f a do t product.


Suppose A equals 3x and B equa ls 2x plus 2y, and  I am asking you , wha t is the dot produc t?

Well, you could use method number one, which , in th is case is by far the fas test, believe me.


Ax is 3 and Bx  is 2, so tha t gives me a 6.


There is no Ay, there is no Az, so tha t's the answer.


It's  just 6--


that's the dot produc t.


You could have done it tha t way.


It's a little bit more complica ted bu t I certainly want to show you that it works .


If th is is the x direc tion and this is the y direc tion--


we don' t have to look  in to the z d irection because there is no z componen t--


then th is wou ld be vec tor A and this poin t would be at 3 .


B... this would be 2 , and this would be 2 and so this would be the vector B.


And it's immedia tely clear now that th is angle ... 45 degrees.


That  follows from the 2 and the 2.


So if we now app ly method number two , A do t B.


First the length o f A, tha t's 3 , times the length o f B, tha t is 2 , times the square roo t of 2--


this  is 2 , this  is 2, this is 2 ... square roo t 2--


times the cosine of 45 degrees, which is one-half square roo t 2 , and the answer  is 6.


Notice that th is square roo t of 2 and th is square roo t o f 2 equa l just 2, and you ge t 6 .


You ge t the same answer, of course .


Bu t it would be a dumb thing to do it since it can be done so much easier .


On cross products ...


I don't wan t to go through the forma lism o f cross products the way we did  that with the

determinan t.


I just wan t to remind you tha t if you have a cross product o f two vectors , tha t is minus B cross A,

and tha t the magnitude o f C  is the length o f A times the leng th of B times the sine o f the ang le

between them.


The vec tor C , the do t produc t...


the cross produc t is always perpendicular to bo th A and perpendicular to B.


In o ther words , it's perpendicu lar to the p lane of  the two vectors.


Now, if it's perpendicular to the plane,  then in that case, it's perpendicular to the blackboard .


You have two choices : it's either coming a t you perpendicular or  it's coming righ t straight in to the

blackboard.


And now everyone has his own way o f doing it.


I taugh t you what's called "the r ight-hand corkscrew" rule.


You take  the firs t one tha t is men tioned--


in this case , A--


and you rotate it over the shortes t angle to B.


When you do tha t, you rota te your corkscrew--


seen from where you're sitting--


counterclockwise .


Then the corkscrew comes to you.


And so the direc tion o f the vector  is such that you will see the tip o f the vector as though it's

coming stra igh t ou t of the blackboard .


And so tha t gives you , then, the d irection.


Now I will give you the position x of an objec t as a function o f time and then we're going to ask

ourselves a lo t o f questions abou t ve locities, accelera tions, sor t of everyth ing you can  think of,

everything we have covered--


speeds...


And I will cover here four seconds o f time.


So th is is the time axis in seconds and we will cover four seconds.


So le t this be one , two,  three , four .


And le t the object be at position plus six.


This  is my x-axis,  this  is where the objec t is ac tually moving, and th is is three, and here is minus

three and th is, le t's say, is  in meters .


Let's make a little grid so that's easier for me to pu t in the curve.


All righ t, so now comes x as a function o f t.


The time t equa ls t seconds.


The objec t is here and it came from there.


And th is par t is a parabola and th is parabola here is horizontal.


It's  important, you have  to know tha t, so this  is a parabola and this , here, is horizon tal.


So the ob ject goes from plus six to three , then it goes to minus three , then it stays there  for one

second and  then it goes back  in one second to plus six.


It's a one-dimensional problem.


The mo tion is only  in the x-axis , a long the x direction .


Well, let's analyze all  these differen t seconds tha t occur.


Let's first  take the first second, during the first second.


Since this is a parabo la, you know tha t the accelera tion is cons tan t so I hope you will conclude

immedia tely that a must be a cons tan t.


If a is a constant, the position x as a function of time should change as follows: x zero plus v zero

t p lus one-half a  t squared.


I expect you to know this equa tion.


Very o ften do I give you equa tions at the exam and  that may well happen during the second and

the third exam, but it will not be the case  this time .


The equa tions are all very fundamen tal and you have to make them part o f your world .


So th is is an equa tion  that you will have to remember .


All righ t, wha t is the velocity here? The velocity s tarts out to be zero and the velocity here is no t

zero anymore.


If I look a t time t equa ls one , then I have here x zero or six.


It star ts ou t with ve locity zero--


that's a given .


And I ge t plus one-half times a t squared bu t this  is on ly one second, and so when it is a t three , I

have six plus one-half a times one squared , and so you find tha t a equals minus six meters per

second squared .


So during this first second the acceleration is minus six me ters per second squared.


And the velocity , v , as a function o f time , is the derivative of this one, is v zero plus at.


V zero was zero, and so tha t is minus six times t.


So the veloc ity  is changing in a linear fashion .


What do I know abou t the end o f the first second? Well, I can say that x  is three .


What do I know abou t the veloc ity? We ll, the ve locity  is minus six .


What do I know abou t a? I don' t...  I don't know abou t a.


It's true that during this first second a is minus s ix meters per second squared, bu t it changes

abruptly a t this poin t so it's ill-de fined a t this point.


In fact, it's actually nonphysical.


So I really don' t know exac tly at the end what  the acceleration is .


Let's now go to the second second and le t's see wha t happens there .


The second second.


And first let's  look during, and then we'll look at  the situation a t the end .


During the second second , it is clear--


since this is a straight line--


that  the velocity remains constant and it rema ins minus six me ters per second .


That is exactly wha t it was at this poin t a t the end .


You can see it go six meters--


from plus three to minus three--


in one second so the velocity  is minus six me ters per second.


The acceleration is there fore zero.


You see tha t the accelera tion changes abruptly from minus six me ters per second squared  to

zero so I can't te ll you what it is exactly a t this moment in time .


So tha t's the situation during  the second second.


And wha t is the s itua tion a t the end o f the second section... second second? At the end, I know

that x equals minus three.


What is the veloc ity? I don' t know, because it changes abruptly here from minus six to zero , so  I

don't know exactly wha t it is at that poin t.


It's a nonphysical thing , it's a very abrup t change .


And the acceleration, yeah , tha t's a lso a very tricky thing, because if the ve locity  is minus six on

this side of the two seconds and here becomes zero , and if tha t happens  in a split second, there

must be ahuge acceleration just a t tha t poin t wh ich is nonphysical.


So I would a lso pu t a question mark at the a...


I don't know wha t the a is.


So we'll go to  the th ird second ... this part.


Let's first look during the third second.


Well, the objec t isn't going anywhere, it's just sitting  there.


x rema ins minus three and the veloc ity  is zero and a is zero--


We can agree on that.


What is the situa tion at  the end of  the third second? That means t equals three .


Well, a ll I know  is tha t x  is minus three.


That's nonnegotiable .


What the ve locity  is , I don't know , because it's changing abrup tly from zero to a pos itive value.


So tha t's  ill-de fined and the same is true for the acceleration .


There is a sudden change in ve locity .


That means there must be a huge accelera tion.


It's unknown , ill-de fined because this curve is, of course, not very physica l.


Let's now  look a t the last second.


This  is the four th second.


First, dur ing .


Well, it's going from minus three  to plus six and it's a straight line, so the veloc ity  is cons tan t.


If the velocity  is constan t then you can immedia tely conclude tha t a is zero--


there is no acceleration--


and it goes nine meters  in a time span of one second .


Bu t it's now p lus--


plus nine me ters per second .


So the ob ject first went  from positive values o f x to zero and to negative values for x .


During a ll tha t time , the veloc ity was negative by our sign conven tion and now the velocity, it goes

back to plus six.


The ve locity becomes plus nine meters per second.


What is the story a t the end of  the four th second? Well, all I can say is that x equals plus six.


I don't know much more .


I don't know wha t the velocity is .


Neither do I know wha t the accelera tion is .


The plo t s tops there , anyhow .


Now, I would  think that it is reasonab le to ask the fo llow ing question: What is the average

velocity , for  instance , be tween time zero and time  four? Average ve locity .


We de fine average ve locity as the position a t time four seconds minus the position a t time zero,

divided by four .


That is our definition .


At zero , it is a t plus six, at four, it is a t p lus six .


So the ups tairs  is zero , so the average velocity dur ing this four-second trip is zero.


You may no t like that, it may go aga inst your  intuition .


Of course! I couldn't agree more w ith you bu t tha t's the way we define velocity.


Speed is de fined differently. 

Speed is the magn itude of the velocity vector and the speed, therefore, always has a pos itive 
value. 

And I will show you now wha t is the average speed be tween time zero and four . 

That is the d istance that it has traveled in these four seconds. 

Well, let's firs t go through  the firs t second. 

It goes from plus six to plus three . 

So it already travels three meters. 

Then in the second second it goes from plus three to minus three so it travels ano ther six me ters. 

And then in the third second it's  lazy, it doesn't do any thing, so the dis tance trave led is zero . 

And then in the las t one second it ge ts very ac tive and it travels nine meters . 

Notice you only see p lus signs here . 

There are no minus signs , it would make no sense. 

And th is occurs  in four seconds, so that is 4.5 meters per second . 

So the average speed is 4 .5 me ters per second , but  the average velocity  is zero . 

We cou ld now make a plo t o f the veloc ity as a function of time . 

Let me pu t here the 4 .5. 

I just have enough room here to make the velocity p lot as a func tion o f time. 

I'll make a new one . 

This  is my time axis, and th is is the ve locity . 

This  is zero . 

One second, two seconds, three seconds , four seconds. 

And th is velocity  is  in me ters per second . 

I go up here  to p lus ten and here is minus five , here is minus six. 

So , what do I do now? I know that the ve locity during the first second is minus six t so it's linear . 

And so during the first second th is is the ve locity as a function o f time . 

It star ts a t zero, you can see that, and when it is here it has a velocity o f minus six me ters per

second.


During the second second it remains minus six meters per second .


So during the second second, the ve locity  is not chang ing.


It stays there.


During the third second the velocity  jumps all o f a sudden to zero--


you see how nonphysica l tha t is .


And so a ll of a sudden , during the third second it becomes zero .


So there has to be somehow a connec tion , o f course, between the two to make th is physica l.


So in a very sma ll amount o f time tha t will have  to occur.


That's why you get ahuge acceleration here a t tha t poin t.


Of course, you also get an accelera tion here a t this point, because  there's a lso a change in

velocity .


And then, during the fourth second , the velocity  is plus nine me ters per second , and so we jump

up.


Let's make th is p lus n ine.


And so we have here during the las t second...


And again, this is nonphysical, so there has to be somehow a transition.  And so here you see the

velocity as a function of time .


Now comes an interes ting ques tion .


Is it possible , if I gave you th is--


so th is is a given , you can' t see that--


could you conver t this back to tha t? And the answer  is yes, provided tha t I te ll you what the

position is a t t zero .


At  t equals zero , x equals plus six and  that is sufficient for you to use this  in formation and to

reconstruct that.


It's an interesting thing to do, and if you feel like it I wou ld say, give it a sho t.


All righ t, so far , abou t speeds and average ve locities and accelera tions.


Let's now go to trajectories , three-d imensiona l trajec tories.


Trajector ies, thank goodness, are almos t never three-dimensional.


They're a lways two-dimensional, because the trajectory  itse lf is  in a ver tical plane and so we

normally...


When we throw up an objec t in a gravita tiona l field, you have the  trajectory in a plane.


So we're going to have one trajec tory.


Let this be the x direc tion and le t this be the y direc tion .


Increasing values o f y , increasing values of x.


I take an objec t and I throw  it up with an initia l velocity  v zero.


And wha t is the objec t go ing to do? You're going to get a parabo la under the influence of gravity

and it comes down here aga in.


And where we have th is kind o f a prob lem we will decompose it in  two one-dimensional motions,

one in the x direc tion and one in the y d irection.


We a lready decompose right away the ve locity a t time t equa ls zero in to a component which I call

v zero x and tha t, o f course, is v zero times the cosine of a lpha if the angle is alpha.


And the velocity  in the y direc tion at  time t equals zero--


I will call that v zero in the y direc tion and that is v zero  times the sine of alpha.


And now I have to know how  the objec t moves  in the x direction as a func tion o f time and how  it

behaves as a func tion o f time in the y direction.


So here come  the equa tions for the x direc tion .


x as a function o f time equals x zero p lus v zero x times t.


That's all--


there is no acceleration.


The ve locity  in the x direc tion as a function of  time is simply v zero x--


it never changes.


So tha t's the x d irection.


Now we take  the y direc tion .


y as a function o f time equals y zero p lus v zero y t plus one-ha lf at squared.


My g value tha t I'm go ing to use is a lways pos itive--


either 9 .8 me ters per second squared or sometimes I make it easy to use it, 10--


but mine is always positive .


And since in th is case I have chosen th is to be the increasing va lue of y, that's the only reason

why I wou ld now have to put in minus one-ha lf g t squared--


not, as some o f you think , because the accelera tion is down.


That's no t a reason .


Because I could have called this direc tion increasing y .


Then it wou ld have been plus one-ha lf gt squared.


So the consequence of my choosing this the d irection in which y  increases...


Therefore, the p lus one-half at squared that you would normally see , I'm going to replace tha t

now by minus one-half gt squared .


Then the veloc ity  in the y direction as a function o f time would be this derivative, that is , v zero y

minus gt and the accelera tion equa ls minus g .


So these are the three equations tha t govern the mo tion in the y direc tion .


This only holds  if there is no air drag , no friction of any  kind.


That is very unrea listic if we are near Earth, bu t when we are far away from Ear th , as we were

with the KC-135--


which was flying at an altitude of about 30 ,000 feet--


that, of course , is a little b it more realistic.


And therefore  the example tha t I have picked to  throw up an object is the one whereby the KC-

135, at an altitude somewhere around 25 ,000 or 30 ,000 feet, comes  in at a speed o f 425 miles

per hour , turns the engines off and then, for the rema ining wha tever  it was--


about 30 seconds--


everyone, includ ing the a irplane , has no we igh t.


That's the case that I now wan t to work out quantita tively with you .


In the case of the KC-135 , we will take an angle for alpha o f 45 degrees and we w ill take v zero ,

which was abou t 425 miles per hour.


You may remember tha t from tha t lecture.


425 miles per hour trans lates  in to abou t 189 me ters per second.


And so tha t means that  the velocity v zero y and v zero x are bo th the same because of the 45-

degree angle , and tha t is, o f course , the 189 divided by the square roo t of 2.


And that is abou t 133 me ters per second .


Bo th are positive--


keep that in mind because  this  is wha t I call the increas ing value for y and  this  is the increasing

value o f x.


They are bo th positive values .


Signs do matter.


This  is a given now .


And now comes the firs t question tha t I could ask you on an exam.


When is the plane a t its highest poin t of its trajectory and how high is  it above the poin t where it 
started when it turned the engines o ff when it wen t into  free fall? So when is  it here and what is 
this distance? Well, when is  it there? Tha t's when the velocity  in the y direction becomes zero . 

It is positive. 

It ge ts smaller and smaller because o f the gravitational acceleration, comes to a ha lt and 
becomes zero. 

So I ask this equa tion , when are you zero? This  is the one I p ick and so I say, zero equals plus 
133 minus 10 times t. 

You may think that the gravita tional acceleration at an altitude o f 30,000 fee t cou ld be 
substantially  less than the canonica l number o f 10. 

It is a little less because you're a little bit further away from the Earth, bu t it's only 0.3 percen t 
less, and so we'll just accept the 10.


It's easy to work with .


And so when is it at the h ighes t poin t? Tha t is when  t equals 13.3 seconds .


So tha t's abou t how long it  takes to get there.


When I gave the lec ture last  time, I said it's about 15 seconds, because I made the numbers ...


I rounded them o ff.


It's abou t 30.3 seconds .


And wha t is this distance h now? Ah ! Now  I have to go to this equa tion.


I say h equals zero, because  I'm going to define the po int where the plane s tarts  its trajectory.


I call tha t y zero zero , I'm free to do  that.


h equa ls zero plus 133--


that is the speed--


times 13 .3 seconds minus one-half times g--


that is 5--


times 13 .3 squared .


That is wha t h must be .


And that turns ou t to be abou t 885 me ters.


I think I told you last time it's abou t 900, close enough.


So we know now how long it  takes to reach p and we know wha t the ver tical distance is.


And the whole trip back to  this s tarting poin t--


if we call this sort of a star ting po int, s tar ting altitude--


this whole tr ip w ill take  twice the amoun t of time.


To get back to th is po int when  the engines are restar ted is abou t 26.5 , 27 seconds.


How far has the plane trave led , then , in horizon tal direc tion? We ll, now I go back to  this equa tion .


So now I say, aha ! x then, when it is back a t this poin t, must be x zero--


which I convenien tly choose zero--


plus 133 me ters per second , which is the velocity in  the x direc tion , which never changes .


When the plane is here , that velocity in the x d irection is the same 133 me ters per second as  it

was here , wh ich, by the way , is about 300 miles per hour.


That never changes  if there is no air drag or air fric tion of any kind.


So we get plus 133  times the time and  the whole tr ip takes 26.6 seconds , and tha t, if you conver t

that  to kilometers is abou t 3 .5 kilome ters.


Now, you cou ld ask yourself the ques tion : Wha t is the velocity of  that plane when it is a t tha t poin t

s? &nbsp;


And now ... you may wan t to abandon now this one-dimensional idea o f x and y.


You may say, "We ll, look.


"This is a parabola and it is complete ly symme tric.


"If the plane comes up here "with 425 miles per hour at an ang le of 45 degrees , " then obviously it

comes down here at an angle o f 45 degrees and the speed must aga in be 425 miles per hour."

And you would score 100 percent, of course--

it's clear.


I want you to appreciate , however , tha t I could continue to think of this as two one-dimensional

motions.


And I can therefore calculate wha t the velocity  in the x direction is at s and wha t the velocity in the

y direction is a t s .


So wha t is the ve locity  in the x direc tion at po int s? I go to equation...


the second equa tion there.


That is v zero x, that is plus 133 me ters per second .


What is the veloc ity  in the y direction? Ah, I have to go  to this equa tion now.


v zero y minus g t.


So I ge t p lus 133 minus 10 times the 26.6 seconds to reach that po int s.


And wha t do I find? Minus 133 me ters per second . 

The ve locity  in the y direc tion star ted o ff plus 133 , but now it is minus 133 .


You see,  this  is sign-sensitive .


This  is wonderfu l.


That's the great th ing abou t trea ting it tha t way.


So you now know tha t it comes  in with a ve locity o f 133 in the x direction--


positive--


133 in the minus y direc tion , and so wha t is the ne t, the sum o f the two vec tors? That, of course ,

is th is vector and no surprise , this ang le is 45 degrees and this one is the square root o f 2 times

133 and tha t, o f course , g ives you back your 189 me ters per second.


189 me ters per second , and tha t is 425 miles per hour .


I'm no t recommend ing tha t you would do th is, of course .


It is perfec tly reasonable to immedia tely come to tha t conclusion because of  the symmetry of  the

parabola .


Let's now turn to un iform c ircular mo tion .


Uniform c ircular mo tion occurs when an object goes around in a circle and when  the speed never

changes.


If the speed doesn't change, then the velocity, o f course, does change because the direction

changes a ll the time, bu t the speed does no t.


So here we have our circle .


Let this be radius r, and a t this moment in time, the ob ject is here .


It has a cer tain velocity.


This  is 90 degrees.


And la ter  in time , the objec t is here , the speed is the same, bu t the direc tion has changed, 90

degrees.


So these vectors, they have the same leng th .


In a situa tion like this tha t we have un iform circular mo tion--


so it's uniform...


circular motion--


we first iden tify what we call the per iod T in seconds.


That's the time to go around .


Then we iden tify wha t we ca ll the  frequency,  tha t is , how many times  it goes around per second .


I pre fer the le tter f, bu t our book uses the Greek letter nu.


I find the nu o ften very con fusing with the v o f velocity.


That's why I prefer the f.


It is one over T, and so the units are seconds minus one bu t mos t physicis ts would call that

"hertz." Ten hertz means to go ten times around per second.


And then we iden tify omega , the angu lar ve locity .


Omega, which is  in radians per second.


Since it takes T seconds to go around two pi rad ians, omega is two pi divided by T.


Now, then we have the speed, wh ich we can also th ink of as a linear velocity .


How many me ters per second is  linear, as opposed to how many radians per second, which is

angular velocity.


So th is is a linear velocity, this  is an angular ve locity.


And that linear ve locity , which, in  this case , is rea lly your speed , is o f course the circumference of

the c ircle d ivided by how many seconds  it takes to go around.


And that is also omega r and  that is now  in meters per second.


All this  is on ly possib le if there is an accelera tion, and the accelera tion is called the centr ipetal

acceleration.


It is always poin ted towards the center : "a" cen tripe tal, "a" centripeta l.


And the cen tripe tal accelera tion--


the magnitude--


is v squared d ivided by r , which is there fore also omega squared r, and  that, of course , is  in

meters per second squared .


I want to work out a specific examp le, and  the example tha t I have chosen is the human

centrifuge tha t is used by NASA in Hous ton for experiments on humans to see how they deal with

strong accelerations.


This  is that cen trifuge .


The radius from the axis of rotation--


the axis o f rota tion is here--


and the distance from here to here,  though you may no t think so, is abou t 15 me ters.


So the as tronau ts go in here and  then the thing goes around.


And so I would like  to work ou t this with some numbers.


The radius r--


I'll give your  ligh t back because it may be nicer for you...


The radius  is 15 meters.


It depends, of course , a little bit on where the person is  located in that sphere .


It goes around 24 revolu tions per minu te and tha t translates  into 0 .4 hertz .


So the period to go around  for one ro ta tion is 2.5 seconds.


The thing goes around once in 2.5 seconds .


So the angular velocity omega , which is two pi divided by T...


If you take two p i and d ivide it by 2.5, it just comes ou t to be roughly 2 .5.


[chuckling ): It's a pure ly accident, tha t's the way  it is .


Don't ever think that that has to be the same , of course.


It jus t happens to come out that way for these d imensions.


So omega is about 2 .5 radians per second.


And the speed, linear speed--


tangen tia l speed, if you want to call it--


is omega r.


That comes out to be about 35 ...


37.7 meters per second, and  that  transla tes into about 85 miles per hour, so it's a sizable speed . 

What, of course, the goal is for NASA: What is the cen tripetal acceleration--

that is omega squared r--

or, if you prefer to take v squared divided by r , you' ll find, o f course, exactly the same answer  if 
you haven' t made a slip , and that is 95 me ters per second squared .


And that is abou t ten times the gravita tional accelera tion on Earth ,

which is really phenomenal, if you add , too , the fac t tha t the direc tion is changing all the time

when you go around, so you  feel the 10 g in  this direction and  then you fee l it in a d ifferen t

direction .


I can' t imagine how people can ac tually survive that--


I mean , not  fain t.


Most people , like you and me , if we were to be accelerated along a stra igh t line , no t even a circle ,

where the direction changed , but along a s traigh t line , most o f us fain t when we ge t close to 6 g. 

And there is a reason for that. 

You ge t problems with your blood circula tion and no t enough oxygen goes to your bra ins, and 
that's why you fain t. 

How these astronauts can do it at 10 g and the d irection chang ing all the time, it bea ts me.


If you take a Boeing 747 , it takes 30 seconds from the momen t tha t it star ts on the runway until it

takes o ff.


You should  time tha t, when you ge t a chance .


It's very close to 30 seconds , and by that  time the plane has reached a speed of abou t 150 miles

per hour .


And if you calculate , if you assume tha t the accelera tion is constan t--


it's an easy calcula tion--


it turns ou t tha t the accelera tion is only two meters per second squared .


That is only one- fifth of  the gravitational accelera tion .


Feels sor t of good , righ t? It's very comfortab le, when you're tak ing off.


It's only 2 me ters per second squared .


These poor people , men and women, 95 meters per second squared .


I would like to address someth ing tha t is not par t o f the exam, bu t tha t is some thing tha t I want

you to think abou t, some thing that is fun , and it's always nice to do someth ing tha t is fun .


It has to do with my  last lec ture .


I have to clean my hands first for  it to work qu ite well.


I have a yardstick here , and I am go ing to pu t the yards tick on my hands, on my two fingers,

which I hold in fron t of me.


Here it is.


It's resting on my two fingers, and I'm going to move my two fingers towards each o ther.


One o f them beg ins to slide first, o f course.


I can' t tell you wh ich one.


Bu t some thing very s trange will happen .


If th is one s tarts to slide first, it comes to a s top and then the o ther one star ts to slide and it

comes to a s top .


And then this one star ts to slide and so on.


And that is very strange.


This  is something you should be able to explain , certainly a fter the lecture we had las t time .


Look a t this .


Did you see the a lterna tion? I'll do it a little fas ter.


Left is going, righ t is go ing , left is go ing, right is going , left is going .


Once more ... look at it.

Left is going , r ight is going, le ft is going , righ t is go ing.


They a lternate .


Give this some thought, and you know , PIVoT has an option that you can discuss prob lems with

other students , so make use o f this discussion bu tton and see whe ther you can come to an

explana tion .


Good luck on your exam.


See you next Friday.
