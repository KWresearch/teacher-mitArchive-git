8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics, Fall 1999 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 11 

Today, we will talk exclusively abou t work and energy.


First, let's do a one-dimensional case .


The work that a force is doing , when that force is moving from poin t A  to poin t B--


one-dimensiona l, here's poin t A and here is poin t B--


and the force is along  that direc tion or ...


either  in this d irection or  in this d irection but it's comple tely one-d imensiona l, that work  is the

integra l in going from A  to B of  that  force dx , if I call  tha t the x-axis.


The unit o f work, you can see , is new ton-me ters.


So work is new ton-meters, for which we ...


we call that "jou le."


If there's more than one force in this direc tion , you have to add these forces  in th is direction

vectorially , and then this  is the work tha t the forces do together .


Work is a scalar , so  this can be larger than zero, it can be zero , or  it can be smaller than zero .


If the force and the direc tion in wh ich it moves are in opposite direc tions , then it is smaller than

zero.


If they're in  the same direc tion , either this way or tha t way, then the work is  larger than zero .


F = ma, so there fore , I can a lso wr ite with th is m dv /d t.


And I can write down for dx, I can write down v dt.


I subs titute  tha t in there , so the work in going from A to B is the in tegral from A  to B times the

force, which is m dv/dt, dx which is v d t.


And look wha t I can do.


I can eliminate time , and I can now go  to a in tegra l over velocity--


velocity A to the velocity B, and I get m times v times dv.


That's a very easy  integral.


That is 1/2 m v squared , which I have to evaluate be tween vA and vB, and tha t is 1 /2 m vB

squared, minus 1/2 m vA squared .


1/2 m v squared is wha t we ca ll in physics "kine tic energy." Sometimes we write just a K for that.


It's the energy o f mo tion .


And so the work tha t is done when a force moves from A to B is the kinetic energy  in point B--


you see tha t here--


minus the kinetic energy  in point A, and this is called the work-energy theorem.


If the work  is positive, then the kine tic energy  increases when you go from A to B.


If the work  is smaller than zero , then the kinetic energy decreases.


If the work  is zero , then there is no change in kine tic energy.


Let's do a simple example .


Applying this work-energy theorem, I have an objec t that I want  to move from A to B.


I let gravity do  that.


I g ive it a ve locity .


Here's the velocity v o f A, and let  the separation be h, and this cou ld be my  increasing y direction.


The objec t has a mass m, and so there is a force, gravitational force wh ich is mg, and if I wan t to

give it a vec tor nota tion , it's mg y roof, because th is is my increasing value o f Y.


When it reaches poin t B, it comes to a halt, and I'm going to ask you now what is the value o f h.


We've done tha t in the pas t in a different way .


Now we will do it purely based on the energy considera tions .


So I can write down tha t the work tha t grav ity  is doing in going from A to B, that work  is clear ly

negative.


The force is in this direction and the mo tion is  in th is direction , so the work that gravity  is do ing in

going from A to B equals minus mgh.


That must be the kinetic energy a t tha t poin t B, so that this kine tic energy at point B minus the

kinetic energy at po int A, this is zero, because it comes to a halt here, and so you find  tha t 1 /2 m

vA squared equals mgh.


m cance ls, and so you'll find tha t the height  that you reach equa ls vA squared divided by 2g .


And th is is someth ing we've seen before .


It was easy for us to der ive it in the pas t, bu t now we've done it purely based on energy

considerations.


I'd like to do a second examp le. 

I lift an object  from A to B--

I, Walter Lewin.


I take it a t A.


It has no speed here; vA is zero.


It has no speed there .


And I bring it from here to here .


There's a gravita tiona l force mg in this d irection, so the  force by Wa lter Lewin must be in  this

direction , so the motion and my force are in the same d irection , so  the work tha t I'm do ing is

clearly plus mgh .


So the work tha t Walter Lewin is doing is plus mgh when the object goes from A to B.


The work that gravity was do ing was minus mgh--


we jus t saw that.


So the ne t work tha t is done is zero, and you see there  is indeed no change in kine tic energy.


There was no kine tic energy here to star t with, and there was no kinetic energy there.


If I take my briefcase and  I bring it up here , I've done positive work.


If I bring it down , I've done nega tive work.


If I bring it up,  I do again positive work.


When I do positive work, gravity does nega tive work.


When I do nega tive work, like I do now , gravity does positive work.


And I can do tha t a whole day, and the ne t amount of work tha t I have done is zero--


positive work, negative work , positive work , negative work.


I will get very tired .


Don't confuse ge tting tired w ith do ing work.


I would have done no work and I would be very tired .


I think we would all agree tha t if I stand here 24 hours like th is that  I would ge t very tired .


I haven't done any work.


I migh t as we ll put it here and let  the tab le just hold tha t brie fcase for me .


So it's clear that you can ge t very tired withou t hav ing done any work.


So th is is the way we de fine work in physics.


Now le t's go from one d imensions to three dimensions .


It is not very much different, as you will see .


I go in  three dimensions from point A to poin t B, and I now have a force ...


which cou ld be poin ting no t just along  the x direc tion , but in general, in all direc tions .


Now the work that  the force is doing in going from A to B is F do t dr.


r is the position in three-dimensional space where the force is a t that moment, and dr is a small

displacement.


So if  this  is from A to B, then dr here , if you're going  this direction,  this would be the little vector

dr.


And here , tha t would be a little vector dr .


And the force itself could be like this here, and the force could be like this there .


The force can obviously change along this pa th.


So le t the force be ...


F o f x , x roo f, plus F of y, y roof, plus F of z, z roo f.


I'll move this A up a little, pu t it here .


And le t dr--


the general no ta tion for vector dr--


equals dx, x roo f, plus dy, y roof, plus dz, z roo f.


It canno t be any more genera l.


So the work tha t th is force is doing when it moves from A to B is the integral of th is F dr .


Let's first  take a small disp lacement over dr, then I get dw.


That is simply Fx times dx--


it's a scalar--


because this  is a do t product...


plus Fy dy, plus Fz dz.


That is  little b it amoun t of work if the force is disp laced over a distance dr .


Now I have  to do the in tegral over the en tire pa th to ge t W.


From A to B, tha t's an integral going from A to B, integral go ing from A to B.


I don't need  this anymore.


Integral in going  from A to B, in tegral in going from A to B.


Now we're home free , because we already did this.


This  is a one-dimensional prob lem, and a one-dimensional problem, we already know the

outcome.


The integral F dx, we found tha t is 1 /2 m vB squared minus m vA squared, which in  this case is

obviously the velocity  in the x d irection, because this  is a one-d imensional prob lem.


And the one-dimensional problem indica tes tha t the velocity tha t I'm dealing with is the

component in th is d irection.


So we have tha t this  is 1/2 m v B squared--


and this  is the x component--


minus vA squared , and that is the x component.


This  is also a one-dimensional prob lem now, except  that now I deal with the component...


with the y componen t o f the velocity , so I ge t 1/2 m times vB y squared minus vA y squared , plus

1/2 m vB z squared minus vA z squared .


And now we're home free , because what you see here is you see v squared in the x direc tion , v

squared y componen t, v squared z componen t.


And if you add  those three up , you get exactly the square of  the ve locity.


You ge t the square of  the speed .


So if you add up these three terms, you ge t vB squared ...


I lost my m.


Let me pu t my m in there.


1/2 m times vB squared, and here you see Ax squared , Ay squared , Az squared minus vA

squared, and you get exac tly the same resu lt that you had be fore , namely tha t the work done is

the difference in kine tic energy .


You can always think o f these as speeds.


Velocity squared is the speed .


It's the magnitude squared o f the velocity .


All righ t,  I'd like to return to gravity and work on a  three-dimens ional situation .


We have here , le t this be x , this be y and this be z.


And there is here , this  is the increas ing va lue of y.


And there's here po int A in three dimensions like this .


And there is here point B, so you ge t a rough idea abou t the three d imensions.


And y o f B minus y o f A equa ls h .


It's a g iven--


there is a he ight difference between A and be tween B.


There is a gravitational  force.


The objec t moves from A to B.


Suppose it moves  in some crazy way.


Of course, gravity alone could no t do tha t.


There has to be another force if it goes in a strange way.


Bu t I'm on ly calculating now the work tha t's going to be done by gravity.


The other forces I ignore for now .


I on ly want to know the work that gravity  is do ing.


The objec t has a mass m, and so there is a force mg , and I can write down the  force in vec tor

nota tion .


It's  in th is direc tion .


So now I no tice tha t there is only a va lue for F o f y , bu t  there is no value for F of x, and there is no

value for Fx; they are zero .


And so F o f y equals minus mg .


And so if I calculate now the work in going from A to B,  this  is the in tegral in going from A to B o f

F do t dr, and the only term tha t I have is the one tha t deals with the y direction .


The other terms have nothing in it, so it is the in tegra l in going from A to B o f Fy dy.


And that equa ls minus mg, because we have the minus mg , times y o f B minus y o f h , so tha t is

minus mg times h .


And wha t you see here , tha t it is comp lete ly independent o f the pa th that I have chosen .


It doesn' t ma tter how  I move .


The only thing tha t ma tters is the difference in heigh t between po int A and poin t B.


h could be larger than zero, if B is above A.


It could be smaller than zero if B is below A.


It could be equa l to zero if B has the same height as A.


Whenever the work tha t is done by a force is  independent of its pa th--


it's only determined by the s tarting poin t and the end po int--


that  force is called a "conserva tive force ." It's a very  importan t concept in physics.


I will repea t it. 

Whenever the work tha t is done by a force in go ing from one poin t to ano ther  is independent o f 
the path--

it's only determined by the s tarting poin t and the end po int--

we call that a conservative force. 

Gravity  is a conserva tive force . 

It's very clear . 

Suppose  tha t I do the work--

that  I go from A to B in some very strange way. 

Then it is very clear that the work that  I would have done would be p lus mgh , because my force ,

of course , is exac tly  in the opposite direc tion as gravity.


So whenever gravity is doing positive work , I would be doing nega tive work.


If I hold it in my hand , when I'm doing pos itive work, gravity is doing nega tive work.


Again, I'm going  to concentra te now on a case where we dea l with gravity on ly.


When there's only gravity, then we have  tha t minus mgh is the work done in going from A to B

equals minus mg , times y of B minus y of A, and that now is the kine tic energy at po int B minus

the k inetic energy a t poin t A.


This  is the work-energy theorem.


Look closely here .


I can rearrange this , and I can bring the Bs in one side , I can bring the As on one side.


I then ge t mg times y o f B plus the k inetic energy a t point B equa ls mg times y o f A plus the

kinetic energy at po int A.


And th is is tru ly an amazing result.


We call mgy...


we give that a name, and we call  tha t "gravita tiona l po tentia l energy." Often we write for tha t PE,

or we write  for tha t a u .


And wha t you're seeing here is that  the sum o f po ten tia l energy a t po int B and the kine tic energy

at poin t B is the same as the potential energy a t A and the k inetic energy a t poin t A.


One can be conver ted in to the other and it can be converted back.


Kine tic energy can be conver ted back to po ten tial energy, and potential energy can be conver ted

back, bu t the sum of them--


which we call "mechanica l energy"--


is conserved.


And mechanical energy is only conserved if the force is a conserva tive force.


It's extremely useful.


We will use it many times, bu t you have  to be very care ful.


It's a dangerous tool because it's only true when the force is conserva tive .


Spring  forces are also conservative, bu t,  for instance , fr iction is not a conservative force.


If I move an object  from here to here...


Let's suppose I move  this objec t, and I go along a straight line , then the fric tion is doing negative

work, I am doing positive work .


Bu t now suppose I go from here to here through this routing .


You can see tha t the work I have to do is much more.


Friction is no t a conserva tive force .


The frictional  force remains cons tan t, dependen t on  the fric tion , the kine tic fric tion coe ffic ient, is

always the same ...


the fric tiona l force, which  I have to overcome as I move , and so if I go a ll the way here and then

all the way back to this poin t where I wan ted to be , then I have done a lo t more work than if I go

along the shor test dis tance .


So fric tion is a classic example o f a  force tha t is no t conservative.


If I look a t this result--


the sum o f gravita tional potential energy and k inetic energy is conserved for gravita tional force--


then it is  immedia tely obvious where we pu t the zero o f kine tic energy.


The zero o f kinetic energy is when the object has no ve locity , because kinetic energy equa ls 1 /2

m v squared .


So if  the objec t has no velocity, then there is no kine tic energy.


How about po ten tial energy? We ll, you will say , sure , poten tial energy must be zero when y  is

zero, because tha t's the way tha t we defined it.


You see? mgy is gravitational po ten tial energy .


So you would th ink tha t u is zero when y is zero.


Not an unreasonab le thing to th ink.


Bu t where is y a zero? Is y zero a t the surface o f the Earth? Or  is y zero a t the floor of 26 .100? Or

is y zero here , or  is y zero at the roof? We ll, you are comple tely free to choose where you pu t u

equals zero . 

It doesn' t ma tter as  long as poin t A and point B are close enough toge ther that the gravita tional 
acceleration, g , is very close ly the same  for both points . 

The only thing tha t ma tters then is how far they are separated vertica lly. 

The only thing tha t ma tters is tha t uB minus uA... 

uB minus uA would be mgh . 

It is only the h that matters, and so you can then simply choose your zero anywhere you wan t to . 

It's easy to see. 

Suppose  I have here po int A and I have here poin t B. 

And suppose this separation was h . 

Well, if you prefer to call zero po ten tial energy a t A, I have no problem with tha t. 

So we can call this u equals zero here. 

Then you would have to call  this u... 

you have to call it plus mgh. 

If you say , "No, I don' t want  to do tha t; I wan t to call  this zero"... 

that's fine . 

Then th is becomes minus mgh .


If you prefer to call this zero, that's fine,  too .


Then th is will have a positive gravita tiona l po ten tia l energy, and this will have one  that is higher

than th is one by th is amount.


If you say , " I'd like to call  this zero ," of course the same holds .


What matters  is wha t the difference between po tential energy is .


That is wha t we need when we apply the conserva tion of mechanical energy .


That is wha t we need in order to evalua te how the ob ject changes its kinetic energy.


So where you choose your zero is comple tely up to you .


As long as A and B are close enough so that there is no no ticeab le d ifference in the grav ita tional

acceleration g .


Be fore the end o f this hour , I w ill also evalua te the situa tion that g is changing .


When you go far way from the Ear th , g is changing.


So le t us first do...


look a t a consequence of the conserva tion o f mechanical energy.


Very powerfu l concept, and as long as we dea l with gravity, you can a lways use it.


You see here on the desk some thing tha t looks like a roller coas ter, and I'm go ing to slide an

object from th is direction.


Let's clean it a little b it be tter .


Here is tha t roller coaster.


This  is a circle, and then it goes up again .


And le t the circle have a rad ius R .


This poin t w ill be A.


I release it with zero speed.


I assume that there is no fric tion  for now.


This poin t w ill be B.


And I de fine here y equals zero, or what is even more impor tant, I de fine that u equa ls zero .


And th is is the d irection, positive direc tion , of y.


At A, the objec t has no velocity, no speed .


At B, o f course , it does .


It has converted some potential energy to kine tic energy.


At  this poin t C , this has reached a max imum velocity that it can ever have because a ll the

poten tia l energy has been conver ted to kine tic energy .


And at  this poin t D , if it ever reaches that point, tha t w ill be the veloc ity , say .


Okay, I star t o ff, poin t A is at a distance h above this  level, and so I apply now the conserva tion of

mechanica l energy.


So I know tha t u a t A plus the k inetic energy a t A--


which is zero--


must be u at B p lus kinetic energy a t B, must be u at C plus kine tic energy at C , must be u at D

plus kine tic energy at D .


If there is no fr iction, if there are no o ther forces, only gravity.


So we lose no... no energy goes  los t in terms o f friction .


We know that  this heigh t difference is 2R.


And so now I can write th is in general terms of y...


Take this poin t B.


Think of that being at a location y above the zero line .


Then I can write down now tha t uA, which is mgh ...


That was a given when I star ted .


That was all the energy I had .


That was my to tal mechan ical energy.


If I call  this u zero , which is free choice I have, equals u of B, which is now mgy , plus 1/2 m v

squared a t tha t position y.


This should hold ...


what you see there should ho ld for every po int that  I have here .


It should  for A, for B, for C, for D , for any po int.


I lose my m, and so you find here tha t...


We summarize it a t v squared equa ls 2g , times h minus y.


So th is shou ld hold for all  these poin ts.


Therefore, it should also hold for po int D .


However, at point D,  there is some thing very  importan t.


There is a requirement.


There is a requirement that there is a centr ipetal acceleration , which is in this direction , a

centripe tal.


And that cen tripe tal accelera tion is a must  for this objec t to reach tha t poin t D .


And that cen tripe tal accelera tion , as we remember from when we p layed with the bucke t o f water ,

that is v squared d ivided by R.


And th is must be larger or equa l to the gravita tiona l acceleration g.


If it is no t larger,  the bucket of wa ter would no t have made it to that poin t D.


So th is is my second equa tion tha t I'm go ing to use , so  look very care fully.


So v squared must be larger or equa l than gR , so I have here v squared, which is 2g times h

minus y.


Bu t y for that point D  is 2R , so  I pu t in a 2R, must be larger or equal to gR .


I lose my g , so 2h minus 4R must be larger or equal to R, so h mus t be larger or equal to 2Î©R .


This  is a classic resu lt that almost every person who has taken physics w ill remember.


It is by no means  in tuitive.


It means tha t if I have this ball here--


and I w ill show you tha t shor tly--


and I let the ball go in to this roller coas ter, that it w ill no t make th is po int un less I release it from a

point that is at least 2Î©  times the radius o f this circle above the zero leve l.


If I do it any lower, it will not make it.


So th ink about  this.


That is some thing tha t you cou ld not have jus t easily predicted .


It's a very strong result, bu t it is not something that you say intuitively, "Oh , yes , of course." It

follows immedia tely from the conserva tion o f mechanical energy.


So if  I release it...


That 2Î©  radius point, by the way, is somewhere here.


So if  I release this objec t way be low tha t, it will no t make th is po int.


Let's do tha t.


You see, it didn' t make it.


I go a little higher , didn' t make it.


Go a little higher , didn' t make it.


Go a little higher , still d idn' t make it.


Now I go  to the 2Î© mark...


and now it makes  it.


2Î© times the radius , conserva tion o f mechan ical energy tells you that that is the min imum it takes

to just go through tha t poin t.


Of course, if there were no loss o f energy at all, if  there were no mechanical energy  lost--


that means  if there were no fric tion--


then if  I were to re lease it a t this point, it would have  to make it back to this poin t again , w ith zero

kinetic energy .


Bu t tha t's no t the case .


There is always a little bit o f friction with the track , for one thing , and also, o f course, with a ir.


So if  I release it all  the way here, you would no t expect  that it will bounce up all the way to here .


It will probably stop somewhere there.


It may no t even make it to the end.


We can try that.


Oh, it made it somewhere to here--


a little lower than tha t level.


Of course there is some fr iction, that is unavoidable .


All righ t,  this  is a classic one .


There are many exams where  this problem has been given.


I won't give it to you this time , but it's a classic one .


You see it on the general exams for physics, and it's simply a ma tter o f conserva tion o f

mechanica l energy.


Let's now  look a t the situa tion whereby A and B are so  far apart that the grav ita tional accelera tion

is no longer cons tant, and so you can no longer simply  say tha t the difference in potential energy

between po int B and poin t A is simp ly mgh .


So now we are dealing with a very impor tant concep t, and that is the gravita tional force .


You can think o f the Earth ac ting on a mass or you can th ink o f the sun acting on a p lane t,

whichever you pre fer, bu t tha t's what I wan t to dea l w ith when the d istances are now very large.


Let me  first give you the forma l definition of gravita tiona l po ten tial energy .


The formal de finition is that the grav ita tional potential energy a t a point P is the work that I, Walter

Lewin, have  to do to bring that mass from in finity to that poin t P.


Now, you may say that's very s trange that in physics, there are de finitions which ...


where Walter Lew in comes  in .


Well, we can change it to gravity, because my force is always the same force as gravity with a

minus sign , so it's also minus the work that gravity does when the ob ject moves from in fin ity to

that po int P.


I just like to  think of it, it's easier for me to  think of it, as the work tha t I do.


So if we app ly that concep t, then we firs t have to know what is the gravitational  force.


If th is is an objec t, capital M--


and you can th ink o f this as being  the Ear th , if you want to--


and there is here an ob ject little m, then  I have to know what the  forces are be tween  the two .


And th is now is New ton's Universal Law of Gravity, wh ich he postu lated...


Universal Law o f Gravity.


He says the force that little m experiences, th is force equals--


I'll pu t a little m here and a capital M here--


so it is  little m experiences that force due to the presence of capital M--


equals  little m times capital M times a constant, wh ich Newton , in his days, didn' t know ye t what

that value was, divided by r squared, if r  is the dis tance between the two .


This object, since Newton's Third Law holds--


action equa ls minus reaction--


this force , wh ich I w ill ind icate it as capital M, little m--


it is the force that this one experiences due to the presence o f this one--


is exactly the same in magnitude bu t opposite in direction, and tha t is the Universal Law o f

Gravity .


Gravity  is a lways a ttractive .


Gravity sucks--


that's the way to think o f it.


It always attracts .


There is no such th ing as repe lling forces.


The gravita tional constant G is an ex tremely  low number--


6.67 times 10 to  the minus 11--


in our ... as our units, wh ich is new tons , gram-meters per kilogram or some thing like  that.


That's an extremely  low number .


It means tha t if I have two objects which are each one kilogram, which are abou t one me ter apart,

which I have now here about one meter, that the force which they attract each other is only 6 .67 
times 10  to the minus 11 newtons. 

That is an extremely sma ll force .


If th is were  the Ear th , and I am here and  this  is my mass, then I experience a  force wh ich is given

by th is equation.


This would be , then , the mass o f the Earth .


Now, F equals ma.


So if  I'm here , I experience a gravitational accelera tion , and the gravita tional acceleration tha t I 
experience is there fore given by MG divided by r squared. 

And so you see that the gravita tional accelera tion that I experience a t d ifferen t distances from the 
Earth, or, for tha t ma tter , at different dis tances from the sun, is  inversely propor tiona l with r 
squared. 

We have discussed that earlier when we dealt w ith the plane ts, and we dealt w ith un iform c ircular

motions, and we evaluated the centr ipetal accelera tion .


We came exactly to tha t conclusion--


that  the gravitational accelera tion  falls off as one over r squared.


Ten times fur ther away, the gravita tional accelera tion is down by a factor o f 100.


If you are s tanding near the surface o f the Earth , then, of course , the  force tha t I w ill experience is

my mass times the mass o f the Earth  times the gravitational constan t divided by the rad ius o f the

Earth squared--


just like we are here in 26 .100--


and so th is must be mg.


That's the grav ita tional acceleration if we drop an objec t here.


And so you see that this now  is our famous g , and tha t is the famous 9.8 .


You substitu te in there the mass of  the Ear th , which is six times 10 to the 24 kilograms.


You pu t in here the gravitational constant, and you put in the rad ius o f the Earth, which is 6,400

kilome ters, ou t pops our we ll-known number of 9 .8 me ters per second squared.


Okay, my goal was to evaluate  for you  the gravita tional potential energy the way that it is de fined

in general, no t in a special case when we are near the Earth.


So we now have to move an ob ject from in finity to a point P, and we calcu late the work tha t I

have to do.


So here is cap ita l M, and here is that point P, and in finity is somewhere  there .


It's very, very far away , and I come in  from in fin ity with an object with mass m, and I finally  land a t

point P.


Since gravity is a conservative  force, and since my force is always the same in magnitude except

in opposite d irection, it doesn't matter how I move in ; it will always come up with the same

answer.


So we might as well do it in a civilized way and simply move tha t objec t in from infinity along a

straigh t line .


It should make no difference because gravity  is a conservative force .


So in finity is somewhere there.


The force tha t I will experience , tha t I w ill have to produce, is this force.


The force of gravity is this one.


The two are iden tical excep t tha t mine is in  this direction--


this  is increasing value of r--


so mine would be plus m MG divided by r squared if  I'm here at loca tion r.


And le t this be at a distance capital R  from  this objec t.


You can already see tha t the gravita tiona l poten tia l energy, when I come from in finity with a force

in this direction and I move inward, you can already see that gravitational po ten tia l energy will

always be negative  for a ll poin ts anywhere.


It doesn' t ma tter where  I am, it will always be negative .


You may say, gee, that's sort of a strange thing--


negative po ten tia l energy.


Well, tha t is no t a problem.


Remember that depending upon how you de fine your zero level here , you also end up w ith

negative values for potential energy.


So there's no thing sacred abou t tha t.


What is  important, o f course, if we ge t the right answer  for the gravitational po ten tial energy, tha t

when we move away from this objec t tha t the gravita tional poten tia l energy increases.


That's all  that ma tters .


Bu t whether  it is negative or positive is irre levan t.


So we already know  it's going to be nega tive, and so we can now evalua te the work that I have to

do when I go from in fin ity to  tha t pos ition, capital R .


So here comes the work that Wa lter Lew in has to do when we go from in finity to that point, which

is capital R, radius, from this object.


Think of it as the sun or the Earth; either one is fine.


So tha t is the in tegral in go ing from infinity to R o f my force--


which is plus , because it's an increasing value o f R--


m MG div ided by R squared dr .


That's a very easy  integral.


This  is minus one over r , so  I ge t m MG over r with a minus sign , and tha t has to be evalua ted

between infinity and capital R .


When I substitu te for R, in fin ity , I get a zero, and so the answer  is minus m MG over capital R.


And th is is the potential...


gravita tiona l poten tia l energy a t any distance cap ita l R that you p lease away from this object.


At in fin ity , it's now always zero .


Earlier, you had a cho ice where you chose your zero .


When you're near Ear th and when g doesn't change, you have a choice .


Now you no longer have a choice .


Now the gravita tional po tential energy at in fin ity  is fixed at zero .


So le t's look a t this function, and le t us make a p lot o f this function as a function o f distance.


The one over r rela tionship o f the gravita tiona l poten tia l energy ...


the force , grav ita tional force , falls o ff as one over r squared.


Here's zero.


This  is the gravita tional po tential energy .


All these va lues here are negative, and here I plot it as a function.


I use the symbol little r now  ins tead o f cap ita l R .


And so the curve would be some thing like this .


This  is propor tional to one over r.


If you move an object from A to B and th is separa tion is h, and if A and B are very apart, the

difference in potential energy  is no longer mgh, bu t the difference in potential energy  is the

difference between th is value and this value .


And you have to use tha t equa tion  to eva lua te tha t.


Bu t you can clearly see tha t if I go from here to here--


if I take an object and go from here to here--


that  the potential energy will increase, and that's all that ma tters.


So it increases when you go fur ther away from the Earth if you look a t the Earth , or from  the sun if

you look a t the sun.


Is there any d isagreemen t between this result tha t we have here and the resu lt that we found 
there? The answer  is no . 

I invite you to go  through the following exercise .


Take a po int A in space , which is a t a distance r of A from the cen ter o f the Ear th, say,

and I do tha t...  I start at  the sur face of  the Ear th itse lf, so the rad ius  is the radius of the Ear th.


And I go to po int B, which is a little b it fur ther away from the cen ter o f the Earth, only a distance h .


And h is way , way, way smaller than the radius of the Earth.


So I can ca lcula te now what  the difference in po ten tia l energy is be tween poin t B and po int A, and

I can use , and I should use , this equa tion .


And when I use that equation and you use the Taylor's expansion , the firs t order o f Taylor's

expansion , you will immed iately see  that  the result that you find collapses  in to th is result because

the g a t the  two poin ts is so c lose tha t you will see tha t you will find  then that it is approxima tely

mgh , even though it is the difference between these two rather clumsy terms.


We will, many , many times  in the fu ture, use the one over r relationship for gravita tiona l po ten tia l

energy.


We will get very used to the idea tha t gravita tional po tential energy is nega tive everywhere the

way it's de fined, and we will ge t used to the idea tha t at in finity, the gravita tional potential energy

is zero.


Bu t whenever we deal with near- Earth situa tions  like in 26.100 , then , of course, it is way more

convenien t to deal with the simplifica tion  that  the difference in gravitational po ten tial energy is

given by mgh.


I a lways remember tha t--


mgh , Massachuse tts General Hospital.


That's the best way tha t you can remember these simple th ings.


Now I wan t to re turn to the conserva tion o f mechanical energy.


I have here a pendulum.


I have an ob ject that weighs 15 kilograms , and I can lift it up one meter, which I have done now .


That means I've done work--


mgh is the work I have done .


Believe me , I've increased the po ten tia l energy o f this object 15 times 10 , so abou t 150 joules.


If I le t it fall, then that will be converted to kinetic energy .


If I wou ld let it swing from one me ter heigh t, and you would be there and it would hit you , you'd be

dead.


150 joules  is enough to kill you .


They use  these devices--


it's called a wrecker ball--


they use them to demolish bu ildings.


You lift up a very heavy objec t, even heav ier than this, and then you le t it go, you swing it, thereby

converting gravitational po ten tia l energy into kine tic energy, and tha t way, you can demo lish a 
building. 

You jus t let it hit...


[glass shattering ]


and it breaks a building .


And that's the who le idea o f wrecking .


[laughter ]


So you're us ing,  then , the conversion o f gravita tional poten tial energy to kinetic energy .


Now, I am such a s trong believer o f the conserva tion o f mechanical energy that  I am willing to pu t

my life on the line .


If I release tha t bob from a certain heigh t, then that bob can never come back to a poin t where the

heigh t is any  larger .


If I release it from this height and it sw ings, then when it reaches here , it could no t be higher .


There is a conversion from gravitational po ten tia l energy to kine tic energy back to grav ita tional

poten tia l energy, and it will come  to a stop here.


And when it swings back, it should no t be able to reach any higher , provided that I do no t g ive this

object an initia l speed when I stand here .


I trust the conserva tion o f mechanical energy 100%.


I may not  trust myself.


I'm going to release this object, and I hope  I w ill be able to do it a t zero speed so that when it

comes back it may touch my chin, bu t it may no t crush my chin.


I want you to be extreme ly qu iet, because this  is no joke.


If I don' t succeed in g iving it zero speed , then  this w ill be my  las t lecture .


[laughter ]


I will close my eyes.


I don't wan t to see this .


So please be very qu iet.


I a lmos t didn' t sleep all nigh t.


Three,  two, one , zero.


[class laughs w ith relief]


Physics works and I'm s till a live!


[applause]


See you Wednesday.
