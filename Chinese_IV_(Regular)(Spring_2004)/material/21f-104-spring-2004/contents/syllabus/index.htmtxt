***** Course Description *****
This is the continuing instruction in listening, spoken, reading, and written
Chinese, with particular emphasis on consolidating basic conversational skills
and improving reading confidence and depth. Lab work is required. Intermediate
Chinese I, II and III form a sequence; the Fall semester subject 21F.103 is
prerequisite for the Spring. Students who have completed the streamlined
sequence 21F.107 - 21F.108 are not normally eligible for this subject.
Upon completion of the course, students should be able to speak Chinese with
some fluency on basic conversational topics, achieve a basic level of reading
competence within simplified and traditional characters learned plus common
compounds, and be able to write short compositions.
Classes consist of a combination of lecture, drill practice, discussion,
reading comprehension practice, listening comprehension practice, situational
dialogue practice, and language games.
***** Required Learning Materials *****
Zhang, Phyllis N. with Yuann-yuann Meng, Donald K. Chang, and Irene R. Liu.
"David and Helen in ChinaÂ -- An Intermediate Chinese Course." East Asian
Languages &amp; Culture. New York. U. S. A.:Columbia University.Â Part 1Â and
2.
Hand-out readings (will be given beforehand).
***** Procedures *****
   1. Reading and discussion of grammatical problems from the texts.
   2. Active practice with the learning through class conversation.
   3. Work with sentence-pattern drills, phrases, and exercises from the texts,
      handouts.
   4. Practice in listening, speaking, reading, comprehension, and translation
      using the texts and other sources.
   5. Working on writing in Chinese with the use of website.
   6. Supplementary video or film presentations in Chinese, as available.
   7. Detailed weekly schedules will be posted every Friday that indicate what
      will be covered in class and what you need to prepare for each period.
***** Students Responsibilities *****
Students are expected to preview, read the assigned reading(s) and learn the
assigned characters, paragraphs, patterns before classes, and to participate
actively in class discussions. Students are encouraged to discuss on reading
assignments. Students will be expected to hand in assigned homework on the due
date.
***** Grading Criteria *****
This course final grade will be 100 points, based on class performance,
homework, 9 quizzes, a mid-term, a mid-term oral test, and an end-term
presentation.
The weighing of the various factors is, roughly, as follow:
GRADES ACTIVITIES          POINTS
       Class Performance   15 Points

A      Class Attendance    5 Points
       Class Preparation   5 Points
       Class Participation 5 Points
B      Assigned Homework   20 Points
C      Quizzes             25 Points
D      Mid-Term            20 Points
E      Mid-Term Oral Test  10 Points
F      Presentation        10 points
***** Final Grade *****
Above 94=A
90-93=A-
86-89=B+
83-85=B
80-82=B-
76-79=C+
73-75=C
60-72=C-
Below 59=F
Factors involved in the Class GradeÂ include being on time and
prepared,completing written assignments carefully and on time, and
participating enthusiastically in class activities. Other factors may come in
to play, e.g. improvement versus deterioration over the course of the semester,
and progress relative to starting level.
    * No make-up quizzes unless you have permission from the lecturer
      beforehand. If you are sick or unable to make to the class due to
      unexpected situation, you should contact the lecturer.
    * Homework handed in late will be corrected but receive no credit.
    * Attendance in this class is extremely important. If you were absence
      without any permission from your lecturer, then your final grade would be
      affected.
***** Advice on Approaching the Class *****
Engaging in a foreign language class shouldn't feel like a chore that you
resent having to perform. If it does, you should probably do some serious
thinking about why you are enrolled. A foreign language is a discipline to be
studied with attention and dedication. It requires a high level of
concentration, and a systematic, steady approach. It is in fact a never-ending
process, which involves a consistent accumulation of data (vocabulary) to be
applied within a complex framework (grammar). As such, learning a foreign
language is often frustrating and so it should be dealt with patiently. But the
result of understanding of a foreign language provides lifelong satisfaction.
If you approach this course by wondering how little work you can do and still
get by, or if you approach this class by thinking only about what grade you are
getting instead of what you are learning, then you will not succeed. If,
however, you approach this class with dedication and a positive attitude, I
guarantee that you will be rewarded with the satisfaction that comes from the
genuine acquisition of knowledge and skill.
