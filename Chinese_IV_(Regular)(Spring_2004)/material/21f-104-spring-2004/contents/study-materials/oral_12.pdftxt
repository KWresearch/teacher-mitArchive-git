Lesson 12 Oral Practice 
1. Mr. and Mrs. Zhao talk about Desheng and Hailin. 
A: It looks like Hailin is very well-behooved, and  	B: Yes. Mrs. Wu’s niece is nice   
    looking and is quite smart, too.  
    also her family and our family are  perfectly 
    matched in social status. 
       But I heard that she is very ambitious. 
A: It doesn’t matter if she is ambitious. 	
               B: It does matter I think. 
    The only important thing is that she loves our son. 
A: How does it matter? 	
B: People who are very ambitious 
     like Hailin don’t even have time  
to do their own things, let alone to 
take care of their husband and 
children? 
B: But I can see from her talking that 
     she also wants to go to graduate  
                 school. How can she manage  
     to find time to do house work, 
then? 
B: The only thing you want to do is  
A: But you need to understand that Desheng is a 	
     to have grandchildren. You must 
     “bookworm”. The only thing he knows how to 
     do is read. If it doesn’t work this time, then when      know that I can’t stand it when 
     she thinks she is very

    will we ever have grandchildren?	
 knowledgeable and puts on airs 

too easily. 


A: You think too much. Relax. It looks like 	
     Desheng and Hailin have similar interest.	

2. Hailin and Desheng talk to each other. 
H: Before I thought that you were a “bookworm”.   	 D: Why did you think that way?
 The only thing you knew how to do was to read 
    from morning till night.  
H: Because your glasses are as thick as the  	
     bottom of a beer bottle. 	

D: Ha… I thought before I met you  
that you must think yourself 

     somebody special because you  

     are from the US.  

H: Really? My personality is not like that. But I am  D: Thank you. I think you are cute 
     surprised to find out that you are not the same as  
and sensible, not like some
     I thought before. It is quite fun to listen to your        people who often put on airs just 
     talking, and I can also see from your talking that   because they once lived in the US. 
you are very knowledgeable and considerate.
