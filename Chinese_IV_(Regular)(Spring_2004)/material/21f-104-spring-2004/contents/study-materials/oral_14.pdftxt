Lesson 14 Oral Practice 

A. I heard that you know Desheng. 

A. Which school is he studying at? 
A. What is his major?  

A. No wonder he looks like a bookworm. 

B. Yes, ever since he was introduced to me
     by my aunt, we’ve been very good      
friends. 
B. At MIT. 
B. He is a graduate student majoring in  
     chemistry. 
B. Don’t be fooled just because he acts like  
     a bookworm, actually he has many  
hobbies. 
B. Lots, for example, he is skilled at cooking  
Chinese food. 
B. Yes, he often tells me that Chinese  
cuisine involves a lot of knowledge and  
     many different principles. 
B. He says people from different places have  
their own eating habits. 
B. But Desheng says that in addition to the  
   necessary ingredients, if ginseng is added 
    when cooking meat, the meat will be  
     much more nutritious. 
B. He says some Chinese dishes are tastier  
                 when stir-fried, some are tastier when  
     boiled. If you eat too many cold-natured  
     vegetable, they are bad for your stomach  
     and give you diarrhea; if you eat too  
     much of a “hot” natured vegetable you  
     will suffer “excess interior heat”. 
B. He also says delicious dishes should have  
     good color, be tasty, and smell good.  
That is to say, the dish should look nice, 
     smells nice, and be tasty. 
B. I will let him know when I see him. 

A. What kinds of hobbies does he have? 

A. Really? He knows about Chinese    
cooking and eating? 

A. What kinds of   	knowledge and 
principles? 
A. I know this. E.g. Sichuan people like  
     hot and spicy; Cantonese like mild  
food that is a bit sweet. 

A. What else besides this? 

A. Ha, very interesting. 

A. You must let Desheng know when you  
     see him that I want to learn how to cook  
     authentic Chinese food from him.
