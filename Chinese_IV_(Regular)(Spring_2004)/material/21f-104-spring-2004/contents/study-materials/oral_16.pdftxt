Lesson 16 and 17 Oral Practice 
B: I’ve been in the South for the last two 
A: Hei, Lao Wang, long time no see. Where 
 months. 
 have you been? 
B: From Beijing we passed through Nanjing,
A: What cities did you go to? 
 Shanghai, Guilin and finally got to
 Kunming. 
B: We went by car. 

A: You went to many cities. But how did 
 you go to these cities? 
A: I guess it took many days. 

A: Why did it take you two weeks to get to 
 Kunming?
A: May I know what kind of business you 
 have been doing? I heard from our  
 classmates that you are in business,  but  
 I don’t know what you do.   
A: How is business? 

A: You mean the company is an import 
 export company?

A: But how was this business trip? 

A: Did you do that? Did you compromise? 

A: What was their response after hearing 
 this? 
A: After that, did you get a chance to tour 
 the cities?
A: So which city left you with the 
 impression deepest?

A: Why weather, not food and other things? 

A: Yes, I heard from Wei laoshi that 
 Kunming is nicknamed the CITY OF 
 SPRING, and Chen laoshi said the 
 following sentence in Chinese “THE 
 COLORFUL FLOWERS NEVER 
WITHER AND WINTER  IS WARM, 
 SUMMER IS COOL, AND THIS JUST
 LIKES SPRING THE YEAR AROUND”
 in Kunming.   
A: Next time if you go to these places, 
 would you please take me with you? 

B: Yes, it took us three weeks to get to
 Kunming. 
B: Because the trip wasn’t a tour. We went 
 to these cities for business. 
B: For the last your years ever since Wei  
 laoshi and  Chen laoshi invested one 
million dollars, I’ve been runing WEI & 
   CHEN COMPUTER COMPANY. 
B: So far business is very good. We have  
 many customers both in China and the
 States. 
B: You are right. Our business partners  
 includes Microsoft, Dell, Gateway,  
 Apple, and so on. Each year they order a 
 large quantity of computer parts from us. 
B: Because the global economy is not very 
 Good now, we’ve lowered our products  
 price a bit, but several customers in the  
 South  asked if we could lower the price 
 a bit more. They asked for a 25%
 discount. 
B: We negotiated with them, and told them 
that I could only give them a 25%  
discount if they made a very big order  
that included 3000 more other parts in 
addition to the monitors. 
B: The result was satisfactory. We both
   compromised a bit. 
B: Yes, we did. After doing over business, we  
 toured the cities in order to relax. 
B: Each of the cities has its own  
   characteristics, but Kunming’s weather  
   left the deepest impression on me. 
B: Because when we left Beijing, it was  
 snowing heavily, but when we got to
 Kunming, surprisingly, it was full of
 blooming fresh flowers. 
B: You are right. The weather there is really 
beautiful. Besides, there are many places  
worth visiting, like Stone Forest,
Dianchi Lake, Ethnicity Village, etc. 
Traveling is not only lets us enjoy   
ourselves and relax, but it can also 
   increase our knowledge. 

B: Sure, if your wife agrees.
