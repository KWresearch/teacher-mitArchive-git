3. Why about dragon? 

Dawei and his friend talk about dragon. 
1. I visited some museums and watched 
1. Ei, Dawei, what did you do during the 
   some Spring Festival performances. 
Spring Festival? 
2. My deepest impression is Chinese people’s  
2. What’s your deepest impression about them? 
worshiping the dragon. 
3. The reason my deepest impression is about 
the dragon is because during Spring Festival,  
I saw many dragon images on houses,  
paintings and ornaments, and in museums  
as well. I can say that dragon images can  
be found everywhere in Chinese people’s 
life. 
4. I don’t know, but I am very interested in
finding out. 

5. Though once there were dinosaurs in the  
natural world, there were no dragons. After  
    all, where did dragons in Chinese culture 
    come from? 
6. Then how many ideas about dragons have 
    they had?

7. Do you agree with them? If you don’t
   agree with them, then what is your  
opinion?

8. Why is it associated with ancient  
 Chinese tribes’ dragon worship?

9. No wonder the dragon image I saw 
 has the body of a snake, the head of a horse, 
the jaw of a eagle,  and the horn of a deer. 

10. I was told that dragon image represents 
power because it exists everywhere. 
11. No wonder, I saw that dragon images were 
used to decorate emperors’ beds and  
  clothing. Another thing I noticed 
when I was in China was that Chinese  
  love to say they hope their sons will  
  amount to something. What does that
  mean? 
12. If the child is a girl, then what do they say?

13. I got it. Thanks a lot. I think the dragon 
 is a very interesting topic. 

4. Do you know why the dragon image is 
    considered so important in Chinese 
    culture? 
5. According to what we know, once there 
were animals called dinosaurs in the 
natural world.

6. It is a very complicated issue. Many 
researchers have done research on 
    the myth of the dragon, but so far they 
haven’t reached a consensus. 
7. Some say the dragon image is similar to 
    lightning. They think the dragon image is the   
result of natural phenomena that ancient  
    Chinese couldn’t understand. Ancient  
    Chinese considered lightning as the  
    appearance of god because they saw lightning  
followed by thunder, rain and flood. 
Later, ancient Chinese called this 
natural phenomenon the “dragon”. 
8. I think that another researcher’s study 
    makes more sense. He thinks that the
    myth of  the dragon is associated with the 
    ancient Chinese tribes’ worship of dragons. 
9. Many ancient Chinese tribes used an 
    animal as its symbol. After the tribes were 
unified, they concentrated all animals’ 
    characteristics together to form the dragon  
    image. 
10. Yes. This is the reason why dragons can 
fly in the sky and swim in the water. 
11. Yes, some studies show that the dragon 
   image was the symbol of the 1st  Dynasty, the Xia.  
   That is why emperors called themselves   
  dragons, and Chinese people think of themselves  
  as the offspring of dragons. 

12. It is a proverb meaning they hope their 
   sons will grow up to be a capable man. 
13. They say they hope their girl will grow 
up to be as beautiful and smart as a phoenix”.
