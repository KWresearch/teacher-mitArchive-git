Deﬁne u+ := max{u, 0}, u− := min{u, 0}. For a generalized function u ∈ W 1,2 (Ω) we say

u ≤ 0 on ∂Ω if u+ ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω). Similarly we say u ≤ v on ∂Ω if u − v ≤ 0 on ∂Ω. Finally deﬁne

u := inf {c : u ≤ c on ∂Ω}.

Maximum Principle

We consider the divergence form equation

Lu := Di (aij Dj u) + biDiu + cu = f ,

with c ≤ 0.

T heorem.

Suppose u ∈ W 1,2 (Ω). Assume

•

c ≤ 0

• L strictly el liptic with (aij ) > γ · I , γ > 0

•

•

||bi ||C 0 (Ω) ≤ Λ

f ∈ W k ,2(Ω)

Then




If Lu ≥ 0 then supΩ u ≤ sup∂Ω u+ .

If Lu ≤ 0 then inf Ω u ≥ inf ∂Ω u− .

If c = 0 then the above holds with |u| instead of u.

The last conclusion follows from the ﬁrst two since in that case u and −u each satisfy one

inequality.

Proof. From the statement we have that u satisﬁes an inequality in the weak sense, the integral

inequality

∀ v ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω)

− ZΩ

aij Dj uDiv + ZΩ

(biDi u + cu)v ≥ 0

or

ZΩ

aij Dj uDiv ≤ ZΩ

biDiuv + ZΩ

cuv .

Now restrict to v such that u · v ≥ 0. Since c ≤ 0

ZΩ

aij Dj uDiv ≤ ZΩ

biDiuv ≤ Λ ZΩ

v |Du|.

If supΩ u > sup∂Ω u+ then choose k ∈ R such that sup∂Ω u+ ≤ k < supΩ u. Now pick a speciﬁc v ,

v := (u − k)+ . This v is 0 everywhere except where u exceed k , and in particular where it exceeds

the supremum of the boundary values. Indeed we have v ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω) as well as

And so

Dv = (cid:26) Du for u > k (there v > 0)
0
for u ≤ k (there v = 0)

.

ZΩ

aij Dj vDi v ≤ Λ ZΓ

v |Dv |,

where Γ := suppDv ⊆ suppv . Now by strict ellipticity the lhs ma jorizes λ RΩ |Dv |2 hence

L2 (Ω) = λ ZΩ
λ||Dv ||2

|Dv |2 ≤ Λ ZΓ

v |Dv | ≤ Λ||v ||L2 (Γ) ||Dv ||L2 (Ω)

by the H¨older Inequality (HI) (for p = q = 2) and therefore

||Dv ||L2 (Ω) ≤ c(λ, Λ) · ||v ||L2 (Γ) = c · (cid:16) ZΓ

u. Then we see u must still attain its maximum on a set of positive measure! But then

Dv = Du = 0 there! Which in turn contradicts this previous bound on the volume of Γ = supp(Dv).

So we conclude that there exists no k ∈ [sup

second case of the Theorem follows now since if Lu ≤ 0 then L(−u) ≥ 0 and the ﬁrst case

applies.

Corol lary.

Let L be strictly el liptic with c ≤ 0. Assume u ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω) satisﬁes Lu = 0 on Ω.

Then u = 0 on Ω.

An a priori Estimate

We improve slightly on the aesthetics of the higher regularity proved in the previous lecture for

the case c ≤ 0.

T heorem.

Let u ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω) ∩ W k+2,2(Ω) be a weak solution of Lu = f in Ω, and assume

• L strictly el liptic with (aij ) > γ · I , γ > 0

aij ∈ C k ,1 ( ¯Ω)

bi , c ∈ C k−1,1 ( ¯Ω)

(for k = 0, C−1,1 := C 0 = L∞ )

f ∈ W k ,2(Ω)

∂Ω is C k+2

3

Then

||u||W k+2,2 (Ω) ≤ c · ||Lu||W k,2 (Ω) .

Note that the assumption u ∈ W k+2,2(Ω) is superﬂuous once u ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω) in light of our previous

results.

Also note that this is exactly analogous to what we did in our H¨older theory study; there we

proved Lu = f ∈ C k ,α (Ω), c ≤ 0 implies ||u||C k+2,α (Ω) ≤ c||f ||C k,α (Ω) .

Proof. Case k = 0. We want to prove ||u||W 2,2 (Ω) ≤ c · ||Lu||W 2,2 (Ω) . and we already know that

||u||W 2,2 (Ω) ≤ c · (cid:0)||u||L2 (Ω) + ||Lu||W 2,2 (Ω) (cid:1),
so we now try to demonstrate ||u||L2 (Ω) ≤ c||Lu||W 2,2 (Ω) for all u ∈ W 2,2 (Ω) ∩ W 1,2
0

(Ω). If not, pick

a sequence {um } ⊆ W 2,2 (Ω) ∩ W 1,2
0

(Ω) with ||um ||L2 (Ω) = 1,

||Lum ||W 2,2 (Ω) −−−−→m→∞ 0 and hence by

what we know

||um ||W 2,2 (Ω) ≤ c.

Since W 2,2 (Ω) is a Hilbert space exists a subsequence which converges weakly to u ∈ W 2,2 (Ω)

(note Alouglou’s Theorem applies as we have separability and every Hilbert space is a reﬂexive

Banach space). Since W 2,2 (Ω) ֒→ L2 (Ω) is a compact embedding we actually have um → u ∈ L2 (Ω)

(i.e strongly). But now ||Lum ||L2 (Ω) → 0, hence Lu = 0 weakly. Since c ≤ 0 this implies by our

previous work u = 0 ! In contradiction with ||um ||L2 (Ω) = 1 as um → u in L2 (Ω) so ||u||L2 (Ω) = 1

allora . . .

Corol lary.

Let Ω ⊆ Rn be a bounded domain with C k+2 boundary. Then the map

∆ : W k+2,2(Ω) ∩ W 1,2
0

(Ω) −→ W k ,2(Ω)

is an isomorphism.

4

Proof. Injective: By the previous Corollary if L(u1 − u2 ) = 0 on Ω and u1 − u2 ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω) then

u1 − u2 = 0. This actually applies also to any two such functions in W 1,2 (Ω) with equal boundary

values.

Surjective: Let f ∈ W k ,2(Ω). We can ﬁnd a solution Lu = f with u in W 2,2
0

(Ω) by Riesz

Representation Theorem and our regularity theory. So ∆−1 exists and by our above Theorem

satisﬁes

||∆−1 f ||W k+2,2 (Ω) ≤ C · ||f ||W k,2 (Ω) .

So ∆−1 is continuous. From the deﬁnition of ∆ we see that

||∆u||W k,2 (Ω) ≤ ||u||W k+2,2 (Ω)

(note no constant on rhs ) we see also ∆ itself is a continuous map between those spaces (wrt to

their topologies).

Corol lary.

For appropriate L (see above Theorems) with c ≤ 0

L : W k+2,2(Ω) ∩ W 1,2
0

(Ω) −→ W k ,2(Ω)

is an isomorphism.

Proof. Injective: Exactly as above.

Surjective: We employ the Continuity Method (CM) which will work out exactly as in the

Schauder case. Consider the family of equations

Ltu := (1 − t)Du + tLu = f .

Recall that the CM will provide for the surjectivity of L based on the surjectivity of ∆ (proved

above) once we can prove

||u||W k+2,2 (Ω) ≤ c · ||Ltu||W k,2 (Ω)

5

with c independent of t. And this is indeed the case since each of the Lt satisﬁes the assumptions

of the previous Theorem.

Negative Sobolev Spaces

What happens for the k = −1 case? Where does ∆ map to? ∆u is not deﬁned as a function,

though it is as a distribution: given v ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω) one can deﬁne

∆u(v) := − ZΩ

∇u · ∇v

which realizes ∆u as a linear functional on W 1,2
0

(Ω), in other words

∆ : W 1,2
0

(Ω) −→ (W 1,2
0

(Ω))⋆ .

The motivation for this deﬁnition lies in the fact that when we look at the equation − ZΩ
∆uv we actually mean ZΩ
ZΩ
distributions with measures.

v · (∆udx) and ∆udx gives a distribution under the identiﬁcation of

∇u · ∇v =

Recall the inner product as we deﬁned it in W 1,2
0

(Ω) is

(u, v) = + ZΩ

∇u · ∇v .

By the Riesz Representation Theorem given any element F ∈ (W 1,2
0

(Ω))⋆ there exists a unique

u ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω) such that F (v) = (u, v), so

F (v) = (u, v) = + ZΩ

∇u · ∇v = (−∆u)(v),

as distributions. Therefore ∆ is surjective. Injectivity follows from the deﬁnition of ∆. Continuity

of the inverse is also provided for by the Riesz Representation Theorem

||u||W 1,2
0

(Ω) = ||−∆u||(W 1,2
0

(Ω))⋆ .

6

We conclude from this short discussion that ∆ : W 1,2
0

(Ω) −→ (W 1,2
0

(Ω))⋆ =: W −1,2 (Ω) is an

isomorphism of Hilbert Spaces. This is a natural extension to our previous results, and adopting

this notation they all extend now to the case k = −1.
