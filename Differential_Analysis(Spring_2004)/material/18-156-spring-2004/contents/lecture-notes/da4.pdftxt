The Continuity Method

Let T : B1 → B2 be linear between two Banach spaces. T is bounded if

||T || = sup
x∈B1

||T x||B2
||x||B1

< ∞ ⇔ ||T x||B2 ≤ c · ||x||B1 for some c > 0.

Continuity Method Theorem.

Let B be a Banach space , V a normed space, L0 , L1 : B → V

bounded linear operators. Assume ∃c such that Lt := (1 − t)L0 + tL1 satisﬁes

||x||B ≤ c · ||Lt x||V ,

∀t ∈ [0, 1].

(∗)

Then – L0 is onto ⇔ L1 is.

Proof. Assume Ls is onto for some s ∈ [0, 1]; by (∗) Ls is also 1-to-1 ⇒ L−1
s

exists. For t ∈ [0, 1], y ∈

V solving Ltx = y is equivalent to solving Ls (x) = y + (Ls − Lt )x = y + (t − s)L0x + (t − s)L1x.

By linearity now x = L−1
s y + (t − s)Ls

−1 ◦ (L0 − L1 )x.

Deﬁne a linear map T : B → B , T x = L−1
s y + (t − s)Ls

−1 ◦ (L0 − L1 )x. One has ||T x1 −

T x2 ||B = ||(t − s)Ls

−1 ◦ (L0 − L1 )(x1 − x2 )||. (∗) now gives us a bound on Ls

−1 : since Ls is onto

∀x ∈ B , ∃y ∈ B such that Ls y = x and so

||Ls

−1x||B ≤ c · ||Ls ◦ Ls

−1x||V

||Ls

−1x||B ≤ c · ||x||V ⇒ ||Ls

−1 || ≤ c.

As an application we see that

||T x1 − T x2 ||B ≤ (t − s)c · (||L0 || + ||L1 ||)||x1 − x2 ||,

1

and for t close enough to s (precisely for t ∈ [s −

1
c(||L0 ||+||L1 ||) , s +

1
c(||L0 ||+||L1||) ]) we therefore have

a contraction mapping! Therefore T has a ﬁxed point by the previous theorem which essentially

means that we can solve Ltx = y for any ﬁxed y or that Lt is onto. Repeating this c(||L0 || + ||L1 ||)

many times we cover all t ∈ [0, 1].

Remark. Note as in the beginning of the proof that once such operators are onto they are in fact

invertible as long as (∗) holds.

Elliptic uniqueness

Let us summarize the properties we have establised for uniformly elliptic equations. Let Ω be a

bounded domain in Rn . Let L = aij (x)Dij + bi (x)Di + c(x) be uniformly elliptic, i.e

1
Λ

· δ ij ≤ aij (x) ≤ Λ · δ ij

and assume c(x) ≤ 0.

Let u ∈ C 2 (Ω) ∩ C 0 ( ¯Ω) be a solution of Lu = f ∈ C α (Ω) with 0 < α < 1. Then we have the

following a priori estimates –

A. sup
Ω

|u| ≤ c(γ , Λ, Ω, n) · (sup
∂Ω

|u| + sup
Ω

|f |).

B. Under the additional assumptions

• in the case L has α − H¨older continuous coeﬃcients with H¨older constant Λ,

• Ω has C 2,α boundary

• u ∈ C 2,α ( ¯Ω), f ∈ C α ( ¯Ω),

we had the global Schauder estimate

||u||C 2,α ( ¯Ω) ≤ c(γ , Λ, Ω, n)(cid:0)||u||C 0 (Ω) + ||f ||Cα (Ω) (cid:1).

C. Under the assumptions of B, when c(x) ≤ 0

2

||u||C 2,α ( ¯Ω) ≤ c(sup
∂Ω

|u| + sup
Ω

|f |).

D. The above applies to the Dirichlet problem

Lu = f on ¯Ω,

u = ϕ on ∂Ω

and in particular when ϕ = 0 we get very simply

||u||C 2,α ( ¯Ω) ≤ c · ||Lu||Cα ( ¯Ω) .

T heorem.

Let Ω be a C 2,α domain, L uniformly el liptic with C α ( ¯Ω) coeﬃcients and (¸x) ≤ 0.

Look at al l u ∈ C 2,α ( ¯Ω) and assume f ∈ C α ( ¯Ω). Then the Dirichlet problem Lu = f on ¯Ω, u =

ϕ on ∂Ω has a unique solution u ∈ C 2,α ( ¯Ω) provided that the Dirichlet problem for ∆ is solvable

∀f ∈ C α ( ¯Ω), ∀ϕ ∈ C 2,α ( ¯Ω)!

Proof. Connect L and ∆ via a segment: [0, 1] → Lt := (1 − t)L + t∆. Since those operators are

all linear it is enough to prove for ϕ = 0 as we have seen previously. C 2,α ( ¯Ω) is a Banach space

(Lecture 14), and so is its subspace B(Ω) := {u ∈ C 2,α ( ¯Ω), u = 0 on ∂Ω}. As a matter of fact Lt is

a bounded operator B(Ω) → C α ( ¯Ω) by the assumptions on the coeﬃcients of L. And, by uniformly

elliptic we see from D above

||u||C 2,α ( ¯Ω) = ||u||C 2,α (B(Ω)) ≤ c · ||Ltu||Cα ( ¯Ω) ,

with c independent of t (depends just on L). Note C α ( ¯Ω) is a Banach space and in particular a

vector space. The Continuity Method thus applies.

Strangely enough, we are now back to solving Dirichlet’s problem for ∆ in domains.

Our methods so far were good for providing solution in balls, spherically symmetric domains.

In other words we were able to solve (in C 2,α (B (0, R))!) ∆u = f ∈ C α ( ¯Ω) on B (0, R), u =

ϕ on ∂B (0, R) using the Poisson Integral Formula and estimates for the Newtonian Potential. We

used conformal mappings (inversion) to get indeed C 2,α upto the boundary. We conclude therefore

that

Corol lary. We can solve the Dirichlet Problem for any L satisfying the assumptions of the

Theorem in bal ls.

Perron’s Method gives a solution in quite general domains but we will not go into its details as

later on our regularity theory (weak solutions, Sobolev spaces etc.) will give us those answers.

Elliptic C 2,α regularity

Let B :=ball, T :=some connected boundary portion.

T heorem.

Let L be uniformly el liptic with C α coeﬃcients and assume c(x) ≤ 0. Let u ∈

C 2 (Ω) ∩ C 0 ( ¯Ω) be a solution of the Dirichlet problem Lu = f ∈ C α ( ¯B ) in B ,

u = ϕ ∈ C 0 (∂B ) ∩

C 2,α (T ) on ∂B has a unique solution u ∈ C 2,α (B ∪ T ) ∩ C 0 ( ¯B ).

We know by the previous theorem that if ϕ ∈ C 2,α (∂B ) (and not just on T ) then unique solvability

would be equivalent to the unique solvability of ∆ on B which we have! Therefore this Theorem is

a slight generalization.

Proof. As was just outlined the crucial problem lies in the (possible) absence of regularity of ϕ

on part of the boundary. So we approximate ϕ by a sequence {ϕk } ⊂ C 3 ( ¯B ) such that both

||ϕk − ϕ||C 0 ( ¯B ) −→ 0 and ||ϕk − ϕ||C 2,α ( ¯B ) −→ 0. Solve Luk = f ,

in B ,

uk = ϕk on ∂B .

Now L(ui − uj ) = 0,

in B ,

ui − uj = ϕi − ϕj on ∂B . And by A above (as c(x) ≤ 0)

||ui − uj ||C 0 (B ) ≤ C sup∂B |ϕi − ϕj |. So we conclude our solutions {uk } form a Cauchy sequence

wrt the C 0 norm, i.e in the Banach space C 0 (B ). Therefore we know ∃u ∈ C 0 (B ) with ui −→C0 (B )u

(not just subconvergence!) and furthermore this u satisﬁes u = ϕ on pB .

Now we shift our look to the C 2,α situation; by our interior estimates we have for any B ′ ⊂⊂ B

||ui − uj ||C 2,α (B ′ ) ≤ c(||ui − uj ||C 0 (B ) + ||0||Cα (B ) ).. That is our sequence is also a Cauchy sequence

in the Banach space C 2,α (B ′ ) ⇒ converges in C 2,α (B ′ ) (in particular limit is C 2,α regular). This

B we obtained through the C 0 norm. We do this for any B ′ ⊂⊂ B ⇒
limit must equal the limit u|′

get convergence in C 2,α (B ) ⇒ u satisﬁes Lu = f on B and has the desired C 2,α regularity on B .

We now turn to the boundary portion: ∀x0 ∈ T and ρ > 0 such that B (x0 , ρ) ∩ ∂B ⊆ T

we have the usual boundary Schauder estimates (for smooth enough functions) which give us

||ui − uj ||C 2,α (B (x0 ,ρ)∩ ¯B ) ≤ c · (cid:0)||ui − uj ||C 0 (B ) + ||ϕi − ϕj ||C 2,α (B (x0 ,ρ)∩ ¯B ) (cid:1). This means that in fact

C2,α (B (x0 ,ρ)∩ ¯B )
ui −−−−−−−−−−−→

u and in particular u ∈ C 2,α at x0 . ∀x0 ∈ T .
