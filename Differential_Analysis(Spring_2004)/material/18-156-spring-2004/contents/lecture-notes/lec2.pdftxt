Remark  4  Previously,  we  regarded  u ∈ C 2 (Ω) ∩ C 1 (Ω).  Under  the  assumption  of  this 
corol lary,  we  can  get  formula  holds  for  r  <  R.  Since  u  ∈  C 0 (Ω),  just  take  limit  as

∂B 
for  every  bal l  B  =  B (y , R)  ⊂⊂  Ω  (MVP),  then  u  is  harmonic.  In  particular,  u  is 
analytic. 
Proof:  Take  any  B (y , R) ⊂⊂ Ω, u ∈ C 0 (∂B (y , R)).  Thus  by  Poisson  integral  formula, 
there  is  harmonic  function  h  on  B (y , R)  s.t.  h = u  on  ∂B (y , R). 
Consider  ω = h − u.  Obviously  ω  satisﬁes MVP  on  any  ball  ⊂ B (y , R).  Recall  that 
our maximum  principle  and  uniqueness  proof  only  need MVP,  so  ω  has  zero  boundary 
� 
value  implies  ω = 0  in  B (y , R).  So  u = h  in  B,  i.e.  u  is  harmonic. 
Remark  5  The  proof  just  need  ”for  each  x  ∈  Ω,  ∃B (x, R)  ⊂  Ω  s.t.  MVP  is  satisﬁed 
on  al l  bal ls  in  B (x, R)”. 
counterexample  (NOT  C 0 ):Take  u  on  plane,  u(x, y) =  1  for  y  >  0,  u(x, y) = −1 
for  y < 0,  u(x, y) = 0  for  y = 0.  Obviously  u  is  not  harmonic. 

Corollary  2  The  limit  of  a  uniformly  convergent  sequence  of  harmonic  functions  is 
harmonic. 

Proof:  The  limit  is  continuous  and  still  satisﬁes MVP.
