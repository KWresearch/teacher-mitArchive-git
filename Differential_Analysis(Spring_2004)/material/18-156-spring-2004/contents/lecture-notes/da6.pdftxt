Higher boundary regularity

We extend our results to include the boundary.

Higher a priori regularity upto the boundary.

Let u ∈ C 2 (Ω) ∩ C 0 ( ¯Ω) be a solution of

Lu = f
u = ϕ

on
on

Ω,
∂Ω.

Assume uniformly el liptic and that al l coeﬃcients are in C k ,α ( ¯Ω) with 0 < α < 1 and that Ω is a

C k+2,α domain. If f ∈ C k ,α( ¯Ω) and ϕ ∈ C k+2,α (∂Ω) then u ∈ C k+2,α.

Proof. For k = 0 our previous results apply unchanged (the case c 6≤ 0 can be handled if one

believes the Remark above).

k = 1, the crucial case, we use once again diﬀerence quotients. As usual, localize to B+ :=

B (x0 , R) ∩ ¯Ω, x0 ∈ ∂Ω. Then ﬂatten the boundary with the help of a C 3,α diﬀeomorphism Ψ.

Assume the ﬂat portion lies on the xn = 0 hyperplane. We get

˜L∆h ˜u = ∆h ˜f − ∆h ˜aij · Dij ˜uh − ∆h˜bi · Di ˜uh − ∆h ˜c · ˜uh .

We know the rhs is uniformly C α (Ψ(B+ )) bounded, while the lhs is only so for the directions

l = 1, . . . , n − 1, the tangent directions on Ψ(∂B+ ), since the equation u = ϕ holds there and may

be diﬀerentiated in those directions (and ϕ has 3 derivatives).

We therefore use Schauder estimates for ∆h ˜u which give it is uniformly bounded in C 2,α (Ψ(B+ ′)),

∀B+ ′ ⊂⊂ B+ similarly to the higher regularity Theorem for the interior. This is so since the estimates

used there hold, in fact, upto the boundary. We get therefore Dl ˜u ∈ C 2,α (Ψ(B+ )), l = 1, . . . , n − 1.

We treat the remaining derivative. We have DiDl ˜uC 1,α ( ˜B+ ), i = 1, . . . , n, l = 1, . . . , n − 1 ⇔

Dnl ˜u = Dl (Dn ˜u) (mixed derivatives commute as ˜u ∈ C 2 !). So all we have to show now is Dnn ˜u ∈

C 1,α ( ˜B+ ).

From ˜L ˜u = ˜f we ﬁnd

Dnn ˜u =

1
˜ann (cid:0) ˜f − ( ˜L − ˜ann ) ˜u(cid:1).

From previous calculations of the form of ˜a we see that choosing Ψ appropriately we may diagonalize

it. Then uniformly elliptic gives

˜ann

C 2,α (Ψ(B+ )) ⇔ u is C 3,α near x0 .

> γ > 0. The rhs is C 1,α ( ˜B+ ) ⇔ so is lhs ⇔ D ˜u ∈

The cases k ≥ 2 are handled as in the interior Theorem.

This wraps up our discussion on H¨older spaces/norms.

Hilbert spaces

Let V be a vector space over the ﬁeld R. Let (·, ·) be a map V × V → R such that

i) (x, y) = (y , x)

ii) (α1 x1 + α2x, y) = α1 (x1 , y) + α2 (x2 , y), ∀αi ∈ R

iii) (x, x) > 0, ∀x 6= 0

Let ||x|| := (x, x)

||(x, y)|| ≤ ||x|| · ||y || Schwarz inequality

||x + y || ≤ ||x|| + ||y ||

triangle inequality

The 2nd aﬃrms that || · || deﬁnes a norm.

If || · || is complete (cid:0)V , (·, ·)(cid:1) is a Hilbert space.

Let F : V → R be linear, i.e a linear functional on V . If

=: ||F ||V ⋆ < ∞, F is

bounded. Here V ⋆ = {bounded linear functional on V }. Similary for a Hilbert space H deﬁne

similarly H⋆ .

We give the statement of the main theorem regarding Hilbert spaces . Like the Continuity

Method it will serve us as a strong tool for us to attack abstract questions, a tool from Functional

Analysis.

Riesz Representation Theorem.

Let H be a Hilbert space , F ∈ H⋆ . Then ∃ ! f ∈ H such

that

i) F (x) = (f , x), ∀x ∈ H

ii) ||F ||H⋆ = ||f ||H

In particular ⇔ H = H⋆ .

Sobolev Spaces

Motivation

If ∆u = f , u ∈ C 2 (Ω) then ∀ϕ ∈ C 1
0 (Ω) ϕ∆u = ϕf and

− ZΩ

∇ϕ∇u = ZΩ

∆u · ϕ = ZΩ

f · ϕ.

This observation lies at the heart of weak formulations of the Laplace equation.

this norm. It is nice to note that (·, ·) extends to an inner product on W 1,2
0

(Ω): represent any two

elements there as limits of sequences of elements in C 1
0 (Ω) and take the limit of the inner products

of those, which are well deﬁned. Hence W 1,2
0

(Ω) is a Hilbert space.

At this stage we do not yet know how W 1,2
0

(Ω) looks like. Maye its elements are not even

functions.
We continue with the motivation for deﬁning those spaces. Let F (ϕ) := − RΩ f · ϕ, ∀ϕ ∈ C 1
0 (Ω).
F = F (f , Ω) extends to a linear functional on W 1,2
(Ω).

(Ω). We have a weak formulation of

on
on

Ω,
∂Ω.

for any f ∈ L2 (Ω)! Our plan is now:

if f has certain regularity , u has that regularity +2.

The philosophy is instead of classically solving the ∆-equation with an exact explicit solution like

Poisson’s Integral Formula etc. we just enlarge our function spaces. Then the existence of a solution

in the enlarged space becomes trivial (following Riesz). The work comes down to showing that the

solution actually lies back in our original space of functions! That is regularity theory in a nutshell.

We will focus on that in the sequel.

Weak derivatives

For u, vi ∈ L1
loc (Ω) say ”vi = Diu” if

ZΩ

vϕ = − ZΩ

u · Diϕ, ∀ϕ ∈ C 1
0 (Ω).

If such v exists ∀i = 1, . . . , n then u is weakly diﬀerentiable in Ω with ∇u =weak (v1 , . . . , vn ).

If each Dj u satisﬁes the above conditions we say u is twice weakly diﬀerentiable. We will omit

the quotations marks in what follows.

The derivative does not exist pointwise in general. But by the Lesbegues Theorem it does exist

pointwise almost everywhere (a.e).

Deﬁnition

We are now in a position to deﬁne Sobolev spaces. Let ||u||Lp (Ω) := (cid:16) RΩ |u|p(cid:17)

1
p

. Deﬁne

Lp (Ω) := {equivalence classes of measurable functions such that || · ||Lp (Ω) < ∞}

where f ∼ g if f = g a.e.

5

Deﬁne

loc (Ω) ⊆ L1
W k (Ω) := {k-times weakly diﬀerentiable functions} ∩ L1
loc (Ω),

Similarly deﬁne the Sobolev spaces

W k ,p(Ω) ≡ Lk ,p (Ω) = {u ∈ W k (Ω), Dαu ∈ Lp(Ω)

indices α, |α| ≤ k

equipped with the norm

ZΩ

|Dα · |po

(still need to prove it is a norm!). An equivalent norm is given by

ZΩ

X|α|≤k

||Dα · ||L0 (Ω) .

Lp (Ω) is a Banach space ! (Riesz-Fischer Theorem). Also W k ,p(Ω) = Lk ,p (Ω) are.

Claim.

C∞ (Ω) ∩ W k ,p (Ω) is dense in W k ,p (Ω).

i.e. we could have deﬁned W k ,p(Ω) as the

completion of C∞ (Ω) wrt || · ||W k (p)Ω.

Given u ∈ W k ,p (Ω) mollify it to

uh (x) := ZRn

1
hn

ρ(cid:16) |x − y |
h

(cid:17)u(y)dy ,

with ρ a smooth bump function on R with mass 1 and support in [− 1
2 , 1
2 ]. Now u ∈ C∞ (Ω)∩W k ,p (Ω)

and uh → u in the W k ,p (Ω) norm.

We now deﬁne Sobolev spaces of compactly supported ob jects

W k ,p
0

(Ω) := completion of C k
0 (Ω) wrt || · ||W k,p (Ω) .

0 (Ω) vanish on ∂Ω so in a sense W 1,p
Note functions in C k
0

(Ω) (respectively W k ,p
0

(Ω)) can be thought

of as (weak) functions which vanish on ∂Ω (whose ﬁrst k − 1 derivatives vanish on ∂Ω).

Equivalence of norms

For ϕ ∈ W 1,2
0

(Ω) we deﬁned two norms. One using the inner product ZΩ
which gave us the norm

∇ϕ1 · ∇ϕ2 on C 1
0 (Ω)

||ϕ|| = n ZΩ

|∇ϕ|2o

and another norm

||ϕ||′ = n X|α|≤1

= n ZΩ

|ϕ|2 +

n
Xi=1

1
2

|Diϕ|2o

≤ ||ϕ||L2 (Ω) + ||∇ϕ||L2 (Ω) .

These norms are indeed equivalent since we are assuming compact support! The Poincar´e in-

equality shows || · ||′ ≤ (1 + c(Ω)) · || · ||. This inequality fails grossly for non-compactly supported

functions, e.g the constant function. Since || · || ≤ || · ||′ the norms are equivalent.

Remark.

in both of the above norms we deﬁne ﬁrst the norms of functions which are also in

C 1
0 (Ω) and then we extend the norm to the completion by means of norms of limits of sequences

whose elements are all in C 1
0 (Ω) (those are dense).
