Review  of  Green’s  functions. 
G  : Ω × Ω −→ R.

Given  x  ∈ Ω,  let  hx (y)  :  Ω −→  R  be  s.t.  Δy hx (y) =  0  and  hx (y) = −Γ( x − y )  for

y ∈ ∂Ω. 
By  deﬁnition,  G(x, y) = Γ( x − y ) + hx (y).

If  Green’s  function  exists,  then  for  u ∈ C 1 (Ω) ∩ C 2 (Ω), y ∈ Ω,  we  have

Thus  we  can  see: 
If  u = 0  on  ∂Ω,  then  u(y) =  Ω G(x, y)Δu(x)dx = G ∗ Δu. 
(Compare)  By  Green’s  formula,  we  have 
2 (Rn ),  then  u(y) = Γ ∗ Δu.

Proposition  1	 a)  G(x, y) = G(y , x); 
b)  G(x, y) < 0,  for  x, y ∈ Ω, x = y . 
c)  Ω G(x, y)f (y)dy → 0 as x
→ 
∂Ω, where f  is bounded and integrable. 
Proof  of  c):  From  deﬁnition,  G(x, y) = 0  if  x ∈ Ω, y ∈ ∂Ω. 
By  a),  G(x, y) = 0  for  y ∈ Ω, x ∈ ∂Ω.

Given  y = (y1 , · · ·  , yn ),  let  y∗  = (y1 , · · ·  , yn−1 , −yn ). 
It  is easy to check  that G(x) = Γ(x − y) − Γ(x − y∗ ) = Γ(x − y) − Γ(x∗ − y)  is Green’s 
function  for  Rn :+

Then  h  ∈  C 2 (BR ) ∩ C 0 (BR )  and  satisﬁes  Δu  =  0.  So  h  satisﬁes  the  mean  value 
property.  Therefore  u − h  satisﬁes  the  mean  value  property  and  u = h  on  ∂BR . 
But  recall  the uniqueness  theorem  for  solutions  of Poisson’s  equation  – we  only used

the  mean  value  property.  Therefore  u = h,  so  u  is  harmonic.

Theorem  2  The  function  u  deﬁned  above  is  harmonic  in  Ω+  ∪ T  ∪ Ω− . 
Proof:  Obviously  u  is  in  C 0Ω+  ∪ T  ∪ Ω− . 
If one examines  the above proof, one only requires  that  for each point y ∈ Ω, ∃R > 0 
so  that  mean  value  property  holds  in  Br (y), r  <  R.  Also  remember  in  the  proof  of 
maximum  principle,  we  assumed  that  the  function  has  a  interior  max,  then  use  mean

Theorem  4  Suppose  B  is  a  bal l  in  Rn ,  u  ∈  C 2 (B ) ∩ C 0 (B ),  f  ∈  C α (B ),  Δu  =  f  in 
B  and  u = 0  on  ∂B .  Then  u ∈ C 2,α (B ). 
Proof:  By  dilation  and  translation,  we  can  assume  B = B1/2 (0, · · ·  , 0, 2 ).

By  the  previous  theorem,  u ∈ C 2,α  up  to  the  boundary. 
By  rotation,  we  could  do  this  for  any  boundary  point,  so  u ∈ C 2,α .

Δu = f
u = ϕ 
is  uniquely  solvable  for  u ∈ C 2,α (B ). 

Proof:The  existence  of  u  comes  from  Perron’s  method. 
Since Δϕ ∈ C α (B ),  so  let  v  be  the  unique  solution  of Δv = f − Δϕ  in B  with  v = 0 
on  ∂B .  Then  v ∈ C (B ) ∩ C 0 (∂B ).  By  above  result,  v ∈ C 2,α (B ). 
But  u − ϕ  solves  the  problem  also:  Δ(u − ϕ) = Δu − Δϕ = f − Δϕ  in B ; u − ϕ = 0 
on  ∂B .  By  uniqueness,  v = u − ϕ.  So  u ∈ C 2,α (B ).
