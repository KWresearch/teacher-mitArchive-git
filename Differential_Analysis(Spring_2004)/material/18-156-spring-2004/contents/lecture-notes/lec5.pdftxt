Proposition  1  Eigenvalues  of  ΔSn−1  are  −k(k + n − 2),  where  k ≥ 0,  so  λ1 (S n−1 ) = 
n − 1. 
Let  ΔSn−1 Bk (θ) = −k(k + n − 2)Bk (θ),  then

From  this we  get  that  harmonic  functions which  has  form  rpBk  must  satisﬁes  p = k  or 
−k − n + 2,  thus  we  get  a  gap  for  the  values  of  p: 
· · · · · ·  , −n, −(n − 1), −(n − 2), �, 0, 1, 2, · · · · · · 

Δ(f (r)Bk (θ)) = (frr  + 

The  terms  before  the  gap  are  harmonic  functions  blowing  faster  than  or  as  fast  as 
the Green’s  function,  and  the  terms  after  the  gap  correspond  to homogenous harmonic 
polynomials.  The  gap  comes  from  the  removable  singularity  theorem. 

Laplacian  in  inverted  coordinates:  Kelvin  transform  I 
− {0} to be T y =
− {0} −→ Rn 
First we deﬁne the inverted transform T  : Rn 
Note  that  T  = T −1 .  Let’s  ﬁnd  the  component  of  the  metric  tensor  of  y .

Now  the  metric  of  coordinates  x is  gEuc  = (δij ).  Let  ek  =  ∂ yk  .  Suppose  T∗ek  =

Now  let’s  look  at  the  degree  gap  again: 
· · · · · ·  , −n, −(n − 1), −(n − 2), �, 0, 1, 2, · · · · · · 
As  we  have  known,  those  terms  after  “�”  correspond  to  homogeneous  harmonic 
polynomials  uk  =  rkBk (θ).  Apply  the  Kelvin’s  transform  to  this  harmonic  functions, 
we  get 
y 
K uk (y) = |y |2−n uk ( 
2 ) = r 2−n r−kBk (θ) = r 2−n−kBk (θ). 
y| |
Thus  those  terms  before  “�”,  i.e.  those  blow  up  faster  than  the  Green’s  near  origin, 
are  just  the  Kelvin  transform  of  the  homogeneous  harmonic  polynomials.

Also  we  can  know  that  if  we  apply  Kelvin’s  transform  to  homogeneous  harmonic 
polynomials,  then  near ∞,  we  get  harmonic  functions  which  decays  like  rn−2 , rn−1 , rn ,

and  there  is  no  harmonic  function  which  decay  like  rn−3  near ∞.

Harmonic  at  ∞ 
Deﬁnition  2  Suppose  u  is  harmonic  on  Rn  \ K ,  where  K  is  a  compact  set,  then  we 
say  u  is  harmonic  at  ∞  if  its  Kelvin  transform  K u  is  harmonic  at  the  origin. 

Remark  1  1) We  have  to  remove  a  compact  set  K ,  otherwise  if  u  is  harmonic  on  Rn 
and  harmonic  at  ∞,  then  u  is  bounded  in  Rn ,  thus  u  is  constant,  which  we  have  no 
interest.

Theorem  1  Suppose  n >  2, u  is  harmonic  in  Rn  \ K ,  where  K  is  compact  subset.  If 
limx→∞ u(x) = 0,  then  u  is  harmonic  at  ∞.

Corollary  2  If  u  harmonic  on  Rn  \ K ,  and  limx→∞ u = 0,  then  u(x) ≤  |

This  corollary  tells  us  that  harmonic  function  which  decays  at  ∞,  must  decay  at 
least  as  fast  as  the  Green’s  function:  another  “gap”. 
Now  we  turn  to  the  “n = 2”  case. 
Theorem  2  Suppose  n =  2, u  is  harmonic  in  Rn  \ K ,  where  K  is  compact  subset.  If 
log |x|  = 0,  then  u  is  harmonic  at  ∞. 
u(x)

Proof:  Just  the  same  as  last  theorem. 
Corollary  3  n  = 2.  If  u  harmonic  on  Rn  \ K ,  and  limx→∞ 
limit  at  ∞. 

u(x)  = 0,  then  u  has  a 
log |x|

So K u(x)  is  harmonic  on  |x| > 1. 
But  K u  is  analytic,  thus  ΔK u  is  also  analytic,  so  ΔK u  ≡  0  on  Rn  − {0},  which 
means  that K u  is  harmonic.
