Lecture 24

May 13th , 2004

Our motivation for this last lecture in the course is to show a result using our regularity theory

which is otherwise unprovable using classical techniques. This is the previous Theorem, and in

particular the case p 6= 2 (which we haven’t yet done) namely N is a continuous map Lp (Ω) to
W 2,p (Ω). Classical methods give at best W 1,p (Ω). For that we introduce the

Calderon-Zygmund Decomposition Technique: Cube decomposition

Let K0 be an n−dimensional cube in Rn , f ≥ 0 integrable and ﬁnally ﬁx t > 0 such that

f ≤ t|K0 | ≡ tVol(K0 ),

that is 6ZK0

f ≤ t.

f > t. I.e the subcubes where f is highly concentrated. On each of the remaining

Next bisect K0 into 2n equal (in volume) subcubes. Let S be the collection of those subcubes
K for which 6ZK
subcubes (those not in S ) repeat the same procedure, i.e bisect each one into 2n sub-subcubes and
add those where f is highly concentrated to S , bisect the rest et ceter`a. . . Now for any K ∈ S
denote by ˜K its immediate predecessor. Since K ∈ S while ˜K 6∈ S

In summary ∀ K ∈ S t < 6ZK
f ≤ 2n t. Denote F := SK∈S K, G := K0 \ F ≡ F C = TK∈S K C .
We see each point in G lies in inﬁnitely many nested cubes with bounded concentration of f with
diameters converging to 0: 6ZKi

summary, on F we have an average estimate, on G we have a pointwise estimate.

The promised proof

We restate the desired result whose proof we gave for p = 2.

Let f ∈ Lp (Ω) for some 1 < p < ∞ and let ω = N f be the Newtonian Potential of
T heorem.
f . Then ω ∈ W 2,p(Ω) and ∆w = f a.e. and

For p = 2 we have even

T is weak (1, 1) i.e

∀ t > 0.

Proof. Extend f trivially outside Ω (i.e so the extension vanishes on Rn \ Ω), and given any ﬁxed
t > 0 take a large enough cube K0 containing Ω such that

|g | ≤ 2n t a.e, b(x) = 0 on G and RKl
b = 0.
We have now T f = T b + T g . And as in the Interpolation Theorem of the previous lecture

i.e f could be oscillating on Kl , instead we just replace

µT f (t) ≤ µT b (t/2) + µT g (t/2).

We would like to bound this with the L1 (Ω) norm of f . We divide the computation into 3 parts.

Thus by the Marcinkiewicz Interpolation Theorem (MIT) exists c depending on the above con-

stants, i.e on n, p, diam(Ω), satisfying

∀ f ∈ L2 (Ω)

||T f ||Lp (Ω) ≤ c||f ||Lp (Ω) ,

1 < p < 2 !

(2)

From the proof of the MIT c blows up as p approaches either of the endpoints. We mention without

proof that as stronger version of the MIT states that if T is strong (r, r) and/or strong (q , q) then

the constant does not blow-up at r and/or q . Therefore we have in fact 1 < p ≤ 2 in (2). As a
matter of fact we do not even need to invoke this stronger Theorem since we have done the case

p = 2 independently (with constant = 1 !) in the previous lecture.

Yet another idea would be to prove (2) for some one value p greater than 2, and apply the MIT

to get (2) for p = 2 as an intermediate value in the interval (1, p) ! This will also conclude the proof

of our Theorem as p will be arbitrary.

To that end we use the so called Duality Method. Let p > 2 be arbitrary. (Lp (Ω))⋆ = Lq (Ω) with

As we wished: T is strong (p, p). In the last inequality we simply used the fact that 1 < q < 2 is

in the range we have already taken care of.

0 (Ω), ω := N f then ∆ω = f and ||D2ω ||Lp (Ω) ≤ c||f ||Lp (Ω)
In summary we have shown: If f ∈ C∞
for any 1 < p < ∞. Now identically to how we ﬁnished the proof of the last Theorem in the previous
lecture we extend this to all functions in Lp (Ω) by approximating and subsequently taking limits

and making use of Young’s Inequality (Lecture 23).

Our work can be rephrased

(Ω) for some 1 < p < ∞.

||D2u||Lp (Ω) ≤ c(n, p, Ω) · ||∆u||Lp (Ω) .

||D2u||L2 (Ω) = ||∆u||Lp (Ω) .

Proof. u − N (∆u) satisﬁes Laplace’s equation ∆(u − N (∆u)) = 0 a.e. In other words u − N (∆u) is
a harmonic function with compact support in Rn hence vanishes identically. Hence u = N ∆u and

renaming f := ∆u, ω := u gives the inequality from our above Theorem.

This is quite remarkable as it tells us that the whole Hessian, (cid:18)n
2(cid:19) functions, can be bounded
simply in terms of the sum of its n diagonal terms — its trace.

Then ∀ Ω′ ⊂⊂ Ω holds

||u||W 2,p (Ω′ ) ≤ c · (cid:0)||u||Lp (Ω) + ||f ||Lp (Ω) (cid:1).

Proof. We know this for L = ∆, and therefore for any constant coeﬃcients operator satisfying the

above by Lecture 12. Then perturbing the coeﬃcients and proceeding just like in the Schauder

case works, as in Lecture 13, works.

Assuming C 1,1 boundary, these estimates can be extended to hold globally on all of Ω, as in done
in Lecture 14.
