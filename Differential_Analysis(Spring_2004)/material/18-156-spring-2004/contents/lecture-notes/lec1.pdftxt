Theorem  2  Ω ⊂ Rn , u ∈ C 2 (Ω), Δu ≥ 0,  If  ∃p ∈ Ω  s.t. 
u(p) = max u,

then  u  is  constant. 

Proof:  Let 

ΩM  = {x ∈ Ω|u(x) = M }. 
M  = sup u, 
Ω 
ΩM  is  not  empty  because  p  ∈ M ,  ΩM  is  closed  by  continuity,  ΩM  is  open  by  mean

value  inequality.  Thus  ΩM  = M ,  i.e.  u  is  constant  function. 
Corollary  1  u ∈ C 2 (Ω)  C 0 (Ω),  Δu = 0,  then  if  Ω  bounded,  we  have

Corollary  2  u, v ∈ C 2 (Ω)  C 0 (Ω), Δu = Δv  in  Ω,  u = v  on  ∂Ω = ⇒ u ≡ v  on  ∂Ω. 
Corollary  3  Δu ≥ 0, Δv = 0, u ≡ v  on  ∂Ω = ⇒  u ≤ v  in  Ω.  (Hence  ”subharmonic”  )

Theorem  3  Suppose  Ω  domain,  u  ∈  C 2 (Ω), Δu  = 0, Ω�  ⊂⊂  Ω, u  ≥  0  in  Ω,  then  ∃

Choose  R  little  enough  s.t.  B (y , 4R)  ⊂  Ω  for  ∀y  ∈  Ω� .  Let  x1 , x2  ∈  Ω�  s.t.  to  be 
maximal  and  minimal  point  of  u  in  Ω�  respectively.  We  can  cover  Ω�  by  N  balls  of 
radius  R  since  Ω�  is  compact,  so  we  have 
sup u ≤ u(x1 ) ≤ 3n u(x�

Remark  2  1.  A  Harnack  inequality  implies  C α  regularity  for  0 < α < 1. 
2.  A  positive  (or  more  general ly  bounded  above  or  below)  harmonic  function  on  Rn  is 
constant.

By  induction,  we  get  the  stated  estimate  for  higher  order  derivatives. 
Remark  3  We can weaken  the assumptions  to u ∈ C 2 (Ω):  u ∈ C 2 (Ω) and Δu = 0 = ⇒
