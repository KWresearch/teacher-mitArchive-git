Weak  maximum  principle  for  linear  elliptic  operators 
Now  we  consider  the  more  general  diﬀerential  operators 

L = aij (x)Dij  + bi (x)Di  + c(x), 

i.e.,  for  any  C 2  function  u, 

∂ 2u(x)
Lu = aij (x) 
∂xi∂xj 

∂u(x)
+ bi (x) 
∂xi 

+ c(x)u(x),

where  aij , bi , c  are  bounded  functions. 

Deﬁnition  1  Suppose  L  is  like  above. 
1.  If  ∃λ(x) > 0  s.t.  (aij (x)) > λ(x)I ,  then  L  is  elliptic. 
2.  If  ∃λ(x) > λ0  > 0  s.t.  (aij (x)) > λ(x)I ,  then  L  is  strictly  elliptic. 
3.  If  ∃∞ > Λ > λ0  > 0  s.t.  ΛI  > (aij (x)) > λ0 I ,  then  L  is  uniformly  elliptic. 
Theorem  1  Suppose  L  is  el liptic  in  bounded  domain  Ω,  u  ∈  C 2 (Ω) ∩ C 0 (Ω),  Lu  ≥
0, c(x) ≡ 0  in  Ω,  then 

If  Lu ≤ 0  instead,  then 

sup u = sup u. 
Ω

inf u =  inf u.

Proof:  Assume  x0  ∈  Ω  s.t.  u(x0 ) =  supΩ u,  then  (Dij u(x0 )) ≤  0, Diu(x0 ) =  0,  so  we 
get 
Lu(x0 ) = aij Dij u(x0 ) ≤ 0. 
If  Lu > 0,  then  we  have  already  get  a  contradiction.  So  the  theorem  is  true  for  this 
simple  case. 
Now  we  turn  to  the  general  case  Lu ≥ 0.  Without  loss  of  generality,  we  can  assume 
a11  > 0.  Let  v = e 1  for  some  constant  r ,  then 
rx

vii  = r 2 e  1

vi  = re rx δ1i ,

Thus 

Lv = a 11 r e  1  + b1 re  = (a r 2  + b1 r)e  1

. 
Since  a11  > 0,  we  can  choose  r > 0  large  enough  such  that  Lv > 0,  then  for  any  � > 0, 
we  have 

L(u + �v) = Lu + �Lv > 0.

So  by  the  result  of  the  simple  case,  we  get 

sup(u + �v) = sup(u + �v).

Now  we  let  � > 0,  we  get 

sup u = sup u.

For  the  second  part,  the  proof  is  just  the  same. 
To  generalize  the  theorem,  we  deﬁne 
u+  = max{u, 0},  u−  = u − u , Ω+  =  x u(x) > 0}.

Theorem  2  With  the  same  assumption  as  above,  and  suppose  Lu ≥ 0,  c ≤ 0,  then

If  Lu ≤ 0, c(x) ≤ 0  instead,  then

Proof:  Let  L0u =  aij Dij u + biDiu,  then  in  Ω+  we  have  L0u ≥ −c(x)u ≥ 0.  Thus  by 
the  previous  theorem,  we  have 

sup u =  sup u.

Strong  maximum  principle 
First  we  introduce  the  Hopf ’s  lemma. 
Lemma  1  Suppose  L  is  uniformly  el liptic,  c = 0,  Lu ≥ 0  in  Ω. 
Let  x0  ∈ ∂Ω  be  such  that  (i)  u  is  continuous  at  x0 ; 
(ii)  u(x0 ) > u(x),  ∀x ∈ Ω; 
(iii)  ∂Ω  satisﬁes  an  interior  sphere  condition  at  x0 . 
Then  the  outer  normal  derivative  of  u  at  x0 ,  if  exists,  satisﬁes 
∂u (x0 ) > 0. 
∂ ν 
If  c(x) ≤ 0,  then  it  holds  for  u(x0 ) ≥ 0. 
If  u(x0 ) = 0,  then  it  holds  for  any  c(x).

Proof:  Let B (y , R) be  the  interior  sphere,  i.e.  B (y , R) ⊂ Ω and x0  ∈ ∂B (y , R).  Deﬁne 
v(x) = e−αr2  − e−αR2 ,  where  r =  x − y .  Then
|
|
Lv = aij Dij v + bi (−α(x i  − y i )e−αr2 )

= aij (−αδ ij e−αr2  + α2 (x i  − y i )e−αr2 ) + bi (−α(x  − y i e−αr2 )) 
i

= e−αr2 (α2 aij (x i  − y i )(xj  − y j ) − αa ii  − αbi (x  − y i ))

| | ·

Take  A = BR (y) \ Bρ (y),  0 < ρ < R,  then  for  α  large  enough,  Lv > 0  in  A. 
The  assumption  (ii)  tells  us  u(x) < u(x0 )  in  Ω,  in  particular  this  holds  on  ∂B (y , ρ), 
so  there  is  some  δ > 0  s.t.  u(x) − u(x0 ) < −δ < 0  on  ∂Bρ (y). 
Choose  � > 0  s.t.  u(x) − u(x0 ) + �v ≤ 0  on  ∂Bρ (y). 
Since  v = 0  on  ∂BR (y),  we  automatically  have  u(x) − u(x0 ) + �v ≤ 0  on  ∂BR (y). 
Also  we  have  known 

L(u − u(x0 ) + �v) = Lu + �Lv > 0, 
thus  by  the  comparison  theorem,  we  get 
u − u(x0 ) + �v ≤ 0, 

in  A. 

So 

∂ v (x0 ) = �v � (R) > 0. 
∂u 
(x0 ) ≥ −�

For  u(x0 ) = 0,  just  look  at  L − c(x).

Now  we  give  the  Strong Maximum  Principle. 
Theorem  4  Suppose  L  is  uniformly  el liptic,  c = 0,  Lu ≥ 0  in  Ω,  u ∈ C 2 (Ω) ∩ C 0 (Ω). 
If  u  achieves  its  maximum  in  the  interior,  then  u  is  constant. 
If  Lu ≤ 0  and  u  achieves  its  minimum  in  the  interior,  then  u  is  constant. 
If  c ≤ 0,  then  u  cannot  achieve  a  non­negative  maximum  in  the  interior  unless  u  is 
constant. 

Proof:  Assume  u  is  not  constant,  and  achieves  maximum M  at  x0  in  the  interior. 
Let  Ω−  =  {x  ∈ Ω u(x)  <  M }.  By  deﬁnition  we  know  Ω−  ⊂ Ω,  and  ∂Ω−  ∩ Ω =  ∅ 
|
since  u  is  not  constant. 
Let  x1  ∈ Ω−  be  s.t.  x1  is  closer  to  ∂Ω−  than  ∂Ω,  and B (x1 , R)  be  the  largest  ball  in 
Ω−  centered  at  x1 .  Then  u(y) = M  for  some  y ∈ ∂B (x1 , R). 
By  Hopf ’s  lemma,  we  get 

∂u (y) > 0. 
∂ ν 
This is a contradiction, since y is a maximum of u and so Du(y) should be 0.
