Course  overview 
In  this  course,  we  will mainly  be  concerned  with  the  following  problems: 
i uii  = 0. 
1)  Harmonic  functions  Δu = 0,  i.e. 
� 
Dirichlet  problem:  (Ω ⊂ Rn ) 

Δu = 0 
u = ϕ 

, x ∈ Ω, 
, x ∈ ∂Ω. 

2)  Heat  equation:  ut  = Δu, u  : Rn+1  R.→
� 
Boundary  value  problem:  cylinder  domain  Ω × [0, T ), Ω ⊂ Rn . 
ut  = Δu ,  (x, t) ∈ Ω × [0, T ), 
,  (x, t) ∈ Ω × {0} ∪ ∂Ω × [0, T ). 
u = ϕ
� 
3)Poisson  Equation:  (Ω ⊂ Rn ) 

Δu = f 
u = ϕ 

, x ∈ Ω, 
, x ∈ ∂Ω. 

� 
For  which  f , ϕ, Ω  can  we  solve? 
Parabolic: 
ut  − Δu = f (x, t) 
u = ϕ(x, t) 

,  (x, t) ∈ Ω × [0, T ), 
,  (x, t) ∈ Ω × {0} ∪ ∂Ω × [0, T ). 

We  will  prove  existence  theorems  by method  of  priori  estimates.

For Δu = f ,  when  does  certain  regularity  of  f  imply  regularity  of  u?

•  If  f  continuous,  is  u ∈ C 2?  NO! 

We  will  always  consider  in  the  H¨older  spaces  C α (Ω), C 0,α (Ω).  The  norm  is 
|
f (x) − f (y)
|
�f �C α (Ω) 
sup 
|x − y |α 
x,y∈Ω,x=y 
Thus  f  ∈ C α (Ω)  = 
C α (Ω) x − y .
f (x) − f (y)
⇒  |

When  α = 1,  f  is  just  Lipstitz  continuous  functions.

For Δu = f  in  Ω,  we  will  get  Interior  Estimates

where  Ω�  ⊂⊂ Ω, C  = C (Ω, Ω� ).

Notion  of  weak  solution: 
2 (Ω),  here  u ∈ L1 
Δu = f  weakly  on  Ω  if  Ω uΔϕ =  Ω ϕf , ∀ϕ ∈ Cc 
loc (Ω). 

Regularity  theorem:  If u  is a weak  solution,  then u  should has as much  regularity 
as  the  priori  estimates. 
In  practical  problems,  it’s  usually  easy  to  prove  existence  of  weak  solutions. 
The harder problem:  prove weak solution  is regular, and therefore solves the original 
equation  strongly. 

� 
In  general,  the  global  estimates  should  depend  on  ∂Ω  and  ϕ: 
, x ∈ Ω, 
Δu = f 
, x ∈ ∂Ω. 
u = ϕ 
f  ∈  C α (Ω).  Assume  ϕ  is  the  restriction  of  a  C 2,α  function  on  Rn  to  ∂Ω,  i.e.  ϕ  has  a 
C 2,α  extension,  and  ∂Ω  is  C 2,α  smooth.  Then  u ∈ C 2,α (Ω)  and 
u�C 2,α (Ω)  ≤ C (�f �C 2,α (Ω)  + �u�C 0 (Ω)  + �ϕ�C 2,α (∂Ω) ).

� 
Lp  theory:  Δu = f , f  ∈ Lp (Ω).((  Ω  |f p ) p  < ∞)

If  u  is  a  weak  solution.  Does  2nd  order  derivation  of  u  belong  to  Lp ,  i.e.

We  just  look  at Δ.  The  next  is  more  general  elliptic  operators: 
aij (x)Dij u + 
bi (x)Diu + c(x)u = f .

We  also  consider  the  following  problems: 
, x ∈ Ω, 
Lu = f 
� 
, x ∈ ∂Ω. 
u = ϕ 
,  (x, t) ∈ Ω × [0, T ),

ut  − Lu = f (x, t) 
,  (x, t) ∈ Ω × {0} ∪ ∂Ω × [0, T ).

u = ϕ(x, t)

We  call  L  is  uniformly  elliptic  if  ΛI  ≥ (aij ) ≥ λI , λ > 0. 
Schauder  Theory:  L  is  uniformly  elliptic,  aij , bi , c ∈ C α (Ω),  then 
�u�C 2,α (Ω� )  ≤ C (�f �C α (Ω)  + �u�C 0 (Ω) ). 

Idea:  Assuming  coeﬃcients  are  all  C α ,  locally  L  is  close  to  a  constant  coeﬃcients  op­
erator. 

Maximum  principle:  Bound C 0  norm  of  solution  in  terms  of  boundary  data  of  f . 
�u�C 0 (Ω)  ≤ C (�f �C 0 (Ω)  + sup  ϕ ).

This  is  an  A  Priori  estimate:

I)  Assume  solution  exists;

II)  Prove  solutions  satisﬁes  a  priori  bounds; 

III)  Therefore  the  solution  exists.


Motivation:  If  you  want  to  completely  understand  Perelman’s  proof  of  Poincar´e 
conjecture,  you  have  to  know  this  stuﬀ.

Fundamental  Result: (M 3 , g)  compact  3­manifold,  then  ∃ε  >  0  s.t.  Ricci  ﬂow 
system  has  a  smooth  solution  on M  × [0, ε). 
(This  is  called  short  time  existence  theorem.)

b)  linear  functions.
