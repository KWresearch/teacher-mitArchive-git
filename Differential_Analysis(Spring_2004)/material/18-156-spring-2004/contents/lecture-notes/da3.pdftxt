Extending interior Schauder estimates to ﬂat boundary part

T heorem. u ∈ C 2,α (Ω ∩ T ), Lu = f , u = 0 on T , with 0 < α < 1. Assume coeﬃcients are bounded

in C 2,α (Ω ∩ T ) as wel l as uniformly el liptic. Then ∀Ω′ ∩ T ′ ⊂⊂ Ω ∩ T , ∃ c = c(Λ, n, Ω′ , Ω, T ′ , T ) such

that

||u||C 2,α (Ω′ ∩T ′ ) ≤ c(cid:0)||u||C 0 (Ω∩T ) + ||f ||Cα (Ω∩T ) (cid:1).

Proof. As in the last remark we see that our proof consisted of perturbing the equation at any

x0 ∈ Ω′ and relying on our constant coeﬃcients estimates and interpolation methods. Both of these

hold upto the ﬂat boundary from our previous work.

Global Schauder estimates

T heorem.

Let Ω be a C 2,α domain and u ∈ C 2,α ( ¯Ω)⋆ with 0 < α < 1. Let L be uniformly el liptic

with C α ( ¯Ω) bounds on coeﬃcients . Let

Lu = f ,
u = ϕ

f ∈ C α ( ¯Ω),
on ∂Ω.

Then ∃ c = c(Ω, Λ, n) such that

||u||C 2,α (Ω) ≤ c(cid:0)||u||C 0 (Ω) + ||f ||Cα (Ω) + ||ϕ||C 2,α (∂Ω) (cid:1).

⋆ We note that Gilbarg-Trudinger intend by this notation local ly H¨older while we will take it

henceforth to mean globally H¨older in the sense that we assume supx0 6=y0∈ ¯Ω

is

ﬁnite.

Here we let ||ϕ||C 2,α (∂Ω) := inf
˜ϕ:Ω→R

|| ˜ϕ||C 2,α (Ω) .

Proof. It is enough to prove for the case of zero boundary values:

if we can solve the Dirichlet

problem

Lv = f − Lϕ =: f ′ ∈ C α
v =
0

on
on

¯Ω,
∂Ω.

we can also solve our original one by setting v + ϕ solves the original equation. And if we have

the above announced estimates for v then by the triangle inequality (for the relevant norms) and

the uniform ellipticity (which gives ||Lϕ||Cα (Ω) ≤ c · ||ϕ||C 2,α (Ω) ) the same estimates will hold for

u, possibly with a diﬀerent constant.

So indeed we may assume ϕ = 0.

By deﬁnition of a C 2,α domain ∃Ψ, Ψ−1 ∈ C 2,α (Rn → Rn ) mapping each small portion of the

boundary of Ω, say B (x0 , R) ∩ ∂Ω for x0 ∈ ∂Ω to ﬂat boundary. We set as in computations

in the past ˜u := u ◦ Ψ−1 and then D ˜u = Du ◦ Ψ−1 ′, D2 ˜u = D2u · Ψ−1 ′ + Du · D2Ψ−1 . These

computations convince us once more that the relevant norms on a, b, c and ˜a, ˜b, ˜c are equivalent

using Ψ, Ψ−1 ∈ C 2,α (e.g we ﬁnd ||˜b||Cα (Ω) ≤ ||b||Cα (Ω) (|Ψ|C 1,α (+) |Ψ|C 2,α (Ω) ≤ C · Λ).

We have for the ﬂat boundary

2 R)∩ ¯Ω)) ≤ c(cid:0)|| ˜u||C 0 (Ψ(B (x0 ,R)∩ ¯Ω)) + || ˜f ||Cα (Ψ(B (x0 ,R)∩ ¯Ω)) (cid:1).
|| ˜u||C 2,α (Ψ(B (x0 , 1

Now by our above work we know this holds also for u in B (x0 , R) ∩ ¯Ω

2 R)∩ ¯Ω) ≤ c(cid:0)||u||C 0 (B (x0 ,R)∩ ¯Ω) + ||f ||Cα (B (x0 ,R)∩ ¯Ω) (cid:1).
||u||C 2,α (B (x0 , 1

Now we patch up the estimates over a countable cover of ∂Ω by small balls {B (xi , 1
2 Ri )}. ∂Ω being

compact we may choose a ﬁnite subcover say after relabeling {B (xi , 1
2 Ri )}N
i=1 . Finally we adjoin

i=1B (xi , 1
to these estimates an interior estimate for some Ω′ such that Ω \ ∪N
2 Ri ) ⊂⊂ Ω′ ⊂⊂ Ω. And

having this we are done by analysing the diﬀerent cases that might arise in a similar fashion to

previous proofs.

Banach Spaces

Let V be a vector space equipped with a norm || · || : V → R i.e i) ||x|| ≥ 0 with equality

⇔ x = 0; ii) ||αx|| = |α|||x||; iii) ∆− inequality. With a norm we have a metric d(x, y) := ||x − y ||

and we can talk about topology induced from it, convergence etc.

Cauchy sequence: {xi} such that d(xn , xm ) −→N →∞ 0, ∀m, n ≥ N .

Banach space: a normed space complete wrt the norm metric ⇔ every Cauchy sequence con-

verges (wrt the norm metric) in V (limit in V ).

We mention in passing a few examples.

• The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem showing (Rn , | · |) is complete carries over to show

ﬁnite dimensional normed spaces are Banach.

•

(C 0 (Ω), || · ||L1 ) is incomplete, so is not Banach;

• On the other handwhile (C 0 (Ω), || · ||C 0 (Ω) ) and in general (C k ,α (Ω), || · ||Ck ,α ) are Banach,

as can be demonstrated using the Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem [cf. Peterson, Riemannian Geometry,

Chapter 10].

•

Sobolev spaces are yet another example.

Contraction Mapping Theorem. Let B a Banach space and T : B → B a contraction mapping

(wrt to the norm metric). Then T has a unique ﬁxed point.

Proof. Here the assumption translates into ||T x − T y || ≤ θ · ||x − y || for θ ∈ [0, 1). The idea is to

look at the sequence {xn := T nx0 } and show it is Cauchy using the ∆-inquality . Let x ∈ V be its

limit; we see that

T x = T lim xn = lim T xn (by continuity of T!) = lim xn+1 = x.

As for uniqueness, if x, y are two ﬁxed points,

||x − y || = ||T x − T y || ≤ θ ||x − y || ⇒ ||x − y || = 0

and by the norm properties x = y .
