Lp

Theory

Take f any measurable function on a domain Ω ⊆ Rn and deﬁne the distribution function of f
µf (t) := |{x ∈ Ω : |f (x)| > t}|. We use alternatively | · | and λ(·) to denote the Lebesgue measure.

Proposition. Assume f ∈ Lp (Ω) for some p > 0.

tp−1µf (t)dt.

In order for the second equation to make sense we need the distribution function to be measurable

and indeed it is as f itself is.

Proof. First

ZΩ |f |pdx ≥ Z{f >t} |f |pdx ≥ tpλ({x : f (x) > t}) = tpµf (t).

Second, assume ﬁrst p = 1. By Fubini’s Theorem one can interchange order of integration in

Let 1 ≤ q < r < ∞ and let T : Lq (Ω) ∩ Lr (Ω) −→
Marcinkiewicz Interpolation Theorem.
Lq (Ω) ∩ Lr (Ω) be a linear map. Suppose there exist constants T1 , T2 such that

∀ f ∈ Lq (Ω) ∩ Lr (Ω)

µT f (t) ≤ (cid:16) T1 ||f ||Lq (Ω)
t

∀ t > 0.

Then for any exponent in between q < p < r , T can be extended to a map Lp(Ω) −→ Lp (Ω) for al l
f ∈ Lq (Ω) ∩ Lp (Ω). And moreover,

Otherwise stated: weak (q , q) & weak (r, r) =⇒ strong (p, p) p ∈ (q , r), though not for the
endpoints, the constants blow-up there (we say an operator is strong (p1 , p2 ) if it maps functions

in Lp1 to functions in Lp2 . We say it is weak (p1 , p2 ) if its domain is in Lp1 and its distribution

function satisﬁes the ﬁrst inequality in the assumptions above with q replaced by p2 ).

Proof. Take f ∈ Lq (Ω) ∩ Lr (Ω), and let s > 0. Let

f1 := (cid:26) f (x)
0

f2 := (cid:26) 0
f (x)

|f (x)| > s
|f (x)| ≤ s

|f (x)| > s
|f (x)| ≤ s

indeed one notices that f = f1 + f2 . The trick will be to let this splitting of f vary by letting s

itself vary. So |T f | ≤ |T f1 | + |T f2 |. If T f (x) > t at some point x ∈ Ω then either T f1 > t/2 or
T f2 > t/2. This translates into

t/2 (cid:17)q ZΩ |f1 |q + (cid:16) T2
≤ (cid:16) T1
t/2 (cid:17)r ZΩ |f2 |r .

We choose the smaller exponent q for the terms where f is large (f1 ) and larger one r for where f

is small (f2 ), intuitively. This will make sense in a moment when it will be clear how this guarantees

that our two integrals — with diﬀerent integration domains — are ﬁnite. By the Proposition we

have

and once we substitute in the above inequality we get

We chose s > 0 arbitrary in the above construction of fi . In particular we may let it vary. This

is a neat trick. We set s = t to get

constant A, letting t = As and later choosing A appropriately.

Back to the Newtonian Potential

We deﬁned the Newtonian Potential of f

Γ(x − y)f (y)dy =

n(2 − n)ωn ZΩ

Claim.

(Young’s Inequality) N : Lp (Ω) −→ Lp (Ω). Moreover continuously so– ∃ C such
that ||N f ||Lp (Ω) ≤ C ||f ||Lp (Ω) .

Remark. For p = 2 we proved in the past much more: ∆(N f ) = f ∈ L2 (Ω) ⇒ N f ∈ W 2,2 (Ω).
Also our previous estimates on the Newtonian Potential can actually be made to extend our Claim

to W 1,p (Ω) regularity. These estimates can not give though W 2,p (Ω) estimates (see the beginning

of the next Lecture).

For p = 2 we have even

Proof. We prove just for p = 2, leaving the hard work for the next and last lecture. First we assume

0 (Rn ). From long time ago: f ∈ C∞
0 (Rn ) ⇒ ω ∈ C∞ (Rn ) and ∆ω = f (H¨older Theory for

The last equality results from our assumption that f vanishes on ∂B , i.e has compact support

inside Ω. Now since f is smooth

Therefore as we let R −→ ∞, the second term - which is integrated only over the sphere of radius
R in Rn – tends to 0. Then we have in the limit the desired result (after substituting (1) for the

rhs ).

As the rhs tends to 0 for i, j large we have that {D2ωm} converges in L2 (Ω), i.e {ωm } converges in
W 2,2 (Ω). Since we already know its limit is ω ∈ L2 (Ω) we conclude that in fact ω ∈ W 2,2 (Ω) !
