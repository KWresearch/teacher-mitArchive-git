Theorem  1  Suppose  u ∈ L1 
loc ,  then  u  is  harmonic 
u  satisﬁes  MVP  on  Ω.

Proof:	 Take  C∞  function  ρ  on  Rn  with  properties:  (a)  S upp(ρ) ⊂ B (0, 1);  (b)  ρ ≥ 0; 
(c)  ρ  is  radical,  i.e.  ρ(x) = ρ(|x|);  and  (d) 
ρ(x)dx = 1.

For  the  function  Γ(x),  we  have  (in  distributional  sense  )  ΔΓ(x) =  δ0 (x),  i.e.  for 
ϕ ∈ Cc 
2 (Rn ), 
Γ(x)Δϕ(x)dx = ϕ(0) =  ϕδ(0). 
Rn 
More  generally, ΔΓ(x − y) = δy (x).

Proof:  Choose  R  large  so  that  S uppϕ  ⊂  B (0, R).  Choose  ρ  small.  From  Green’s

Claim  3.  ur (x)  is  harmonic.

In  fact,  for  any  ϕ ∈ Cc 
2 (Ω),  so  by  the  assumption  we  have 
� 
u(y)Δy ϕr (y)dy = 0. 
Ω 
Thus  by  claim  2,  Ω ur (x)Δϕ(x)dx = 0  for  any  ϕ ∈ Cc

But  ur (x) ∈ C∞ (Ω),  thus

which  implies  Δur (x) = 0,  i.e.  ur (x)  is  harmonic.

Claim  4.  {ur } uniquely  bounded  and  equicontinuous  on  any  Ω�  ⊂⊂ Ω.

Claim  5.  u  is  smooth. 
In  fact,  by  Arzela­Ascoli  theorem,  there  is  some  subsequence  ri  → 0, i  → ∞ s.t. 
uri  → v ∈ C∞  on  Ω�  ⊂ Ω. 
But  uri  =  ρ(ri )  ∗ u  → u  in  L1  as  ri  → 0,  so  u  =  v  on  Ω� .  Thus  u  is  smooth  on  Ω.

Now  since  u  is  smooth,  we  have

so  Δu = 0,  i.e.  u  is  harmonic.
