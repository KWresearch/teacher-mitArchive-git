Final Project Description, by Alexander M. Burg, Bryan A Haddon, and Dana 
Gorodetsky 

Our idea is loosely based on Madlibs. One of the downsides of Madlibs (as we see it) is 
that when words are randomly substituted in, it's often just gibberish and not interesting. 
We set about designing a similar system that would better tap into the reader/writer's 
creativity, and come up with something closer to a creative group writing experience. 

We wondered, how would it be possible to replace the random insertion of words? By 
allowing them to see the sentence that they are filling in. What fun is that though? So 
what we decided to do instead was to make interchangable sentences that are missing 
words and phrases. So there are multiple possible first sentences, multiple possible 
second sentences, etc. 

To play the game, the sentences are distributed to different people, who fill them in, 
hopefully to make them as creative and interesting as possible. So the first person would 
pick the first sentence with blanks of out of multiple possible first sentences by drawing it 
out of a hat. He'd fill it in, and this would be the first line of the story. The second person 
would draw one of the second sentences, and fill it in, until the story is completed. In this 
way, a general plot structure could be maintained, beginning, middle, end. Also, each 
individual sentence would make much more sense than often happens in a madlib. In this 
way, we were hoping to create a less random, but more creative and interesting version of 
the madlib. Another way we considered doing this was using a simple computer program.
