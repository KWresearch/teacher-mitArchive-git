"The  mind  of  the  sage,  being  in  repose,  becomes  the  mirror  of  the  universe,  the 
speculum of all creation." -Zhuangzi 

The boy would  try  to pull himself out of bed each morning by 9.  If  it had been a 
hot night, this wasn't difficult.  The loud mechanical "clunk" from the fan, marking every 
passage  through  degree  48  of  its  oscillation,  would  wrench  him  from  half-sleep  even  if 
his  sheets  hadn't  that  night  reached  a  sweat  saturation  point  sufficient  to  turn  repose  to 
intolerable  wallow.  But  had  the  night  been  temperate,  like  this  night  had  been,  some 
minor effort was needed, some spark of dawning awareness sufficient enough to trigger a 
motor response: a drawing away of the thin sheet, a dragging of the legs beyond the edge 
of  the  mattress.  Now  gravity  assisted,  with  the  pelvis  a  pivot  point,  the  ever-warming 
muscles in the thighs and abdomen, such as he had, levered upright the onerous torso and 
pushed it aloft. 
The  machine  took  over,  then.  The  muscle  memory  coordinated  propulsion  past 
the door, down the hall, and into the living room where, having done their morning work, 
his  legs  collapsed  into  a  heap,  now  dumb  cantilever  to  the  spine,  which  arched  up  and 
forward  like  a  gallows.  But  the  position  was  all  for  convenience  and  comfort;  the  head 
needed  no  support,  or  rather,  it  had  all  the  external  support  required.  A  beam,  invisible 
(immaterial, in fact, but all the stronger for its lack of weight), emanated from the TV set, 
penetrated his head  through  the eyes, and held  that mousy-haired orb  rigid.  These forms 
—the  boy,  the  television  set,  and  the  ineffable  link  between  them—created  a  perfect 
equilibrium.  Given  the  thermodynamics  of  the  house,  this  arrangement  constituted  the 
lowest energy state for all involved. 
No mindless  slave  to  the  television,  this one.  No.  He was a  real professional.  It 
took  dedication  to  keep  this  up  all  day,  just  like  any  job.  Patience  was  often  necessary. 
Certainly  quick  thinking.  Most  importantly,  it  took  a  good  strategy.  Channel  flipping 
was  for  dilettantes  or  people  with  remote  controls.  He  was  neither.  Sometimes  he 
couldn't even find the TV guide, and often it was inaccurate. Anyway, it wasn't enough to 
know  the  shows  and  pick  the  ones  you wanted  to watch.  You  had  to  feel  the  rhythm  of 
the day's programming.  Transitions were important, repetition a real danger. 
Early  morning  TV,  though  dutifully  attended  by  the  boy,  was  especially 
treacherous.  The  live  "morning  crew"  magazine  shows  that  dominated  the  networks 
usually  had  one  feature  between  them  that was worth watching:  a  chat with  an  actor  the 
boy  admired, or  a  showcase  of  gadgets  ahead  of  the most  proximal  gifting holiday.  The 
remainder  of  those  shows,  however,  was  real  brain  degenerating  stuff.  A  reliable 
alternative  was  to  flip  to  Sesame  Street  for  that  hour.  But  of  that  hour,  at  least  25 
minutes  would  be  ABC  songs,  animations  he'd  seen  1000  times  before,  or  a  cloying 
dialog between Gordon and some blind kid.  The boy preferred the sketches.  To his taste, 
live  action  (and  puppets)  should  be  comedy.  Cartoons  should  be  action.  But  cartoons, 

2 

except  for  a  few  unwatchable  shows  on C-list  stations  for  churchy  homeschoolers  or  the 
preschool  set,  didn't  come  on  until  3  (the  legacy  of  school  schedules,  that  institution 
doing  its  best  to  ruin  even  his  summer  months).  The  span  between  10  and  3,  then, 
presented the greatest challenge.  The network blocks filled up with wretched soaps in the 
afternoons.  Under  the  right  circumstances,  the  boy  could  kill  10-11AM  with  game 
shows.  But  the  following  4  hours  belonged  to  the  UHF  frontier  and  its  desperate 
showcase of paid programming and "classic" sitcoms. 
But again,  the boy was a discerning viewer.  He did not reject  those old programs 
categorically,  like  some  philistine.  Gilligan's  Island  was  consistently  fine  (and 
sometimes  even  in  color).  The  Andy  Griffith  Show,  however,  was  right  out,  the  boy 
turning  hastily  away  as  soon  as  he  heard  the  first  high-pitched  notes  of  that  whistle. 
Leave  It  to Beaver, when  good, was  probably  the  boy's  favorite,  but was  highly  variable 
day-over-day.  If  he  hadn't  already  seen  an  episode,  he'd  have  to  make  a  critical  guess 
about whether it was worth watching. 
He found himself in this very conundrum that afternoon.  He had never articulated 
his schema for sizing up unseen Beaver episodes, so the following calculations proceeded 
entirely subconsciously. 
Opening: Each season had its own.  Early seasons were best. 
Beaver's Friends: Shows with Whitey were better than shows with Gilbert. 
Wally's Friends: Shows with Eddie were better than shows with Lumpy. 
Plot:  The more potentially outrageous the better. 
Beaver's  Age:  The  "gee  whiz"  shtick  didn't  work  so  well  after  Mathers  started 
pushing 13. 
The  sight  of  Beaver's  now  disproportionate  facial  features  and  poorly  obscured 
acne forced  the boy into action.  He got up and  turned to his plan B  (always have a "plan 
B").  But Donahue was being preempted by baseball.  His only alternative was to go even 
further up the dial, into the heart of darkness, as it were.  He spun the big wheel and came 
to stop at a man, framed him from head to neck in a telephoto shot that almost completely 
obscured the setting.  The boy tried to drop the program into one of his mental slots.  Was 
it  a  religious  kook?  He  was  speaking  like  a  preacher,  kind  of,  but  there  were  no  phone 
numbers  scrolling across  the bottom of  the  screen, no  solicitations  for donations.  Was  it 
an  infomercial?  Where  was  the  product,  then?  The  boy  waited  for  5  minutes,  then  10. 
No  commercials.  Nobody was  trying  to  sell  him  anything.  This made  the  boy  nervous. 
He should really change the channel.  But something made him sit there and listen. 
"Last  year  was  1984.  It  came,  and  it  went.  You  may  feel  relieved,  but  do  not. 
You may think we survived the year without witnessing the realization of the prophecy of 
Orwell,  but  think  again.  Maybe  you're  just  happy  that  we're  all  still  alive,  that  the 
superpowers did not chose this year to end the world with the press of a button.  But there 
are fates worse than death.  Perhaps Orwell, though cunning, lacked vision.  He could not 
imagine  the  sophistication  of  technological  control  in  the  'computer  age'.  Technology 
that obscures  itself as  it  controls,  that disappears  as  its effect becomes more pronounced. 
We have been made eternal children by these technologies.  Coddled and controlled.  Are 
you a child?  Are you a child?  Are you a child?" 
He  repeated  those  words  until  the  image  flickered  and  was  replaced  by  Jack 
Tripper executing a pratfall. 
The boy turned off the TV set and stared into the tube.  He focused through it and 

3 

saw his  reflection, drained of color and distorted by  the curved gray glass.  Blood rushed 
painfully  into  his  legs  as  he  pushed  himself  up,  and  he  stumbled  the  first  few  steps 
towards  his  parents'  bedroom.  He  slid  the  large  mirrored  closet  doors  open  and  pulled 
down a black blazer.  Hung around his  shoulders, over his Empire Strikes Back pajamas, 
the jacket's arms extended well beyond the boy's hands, but he pushed them up and struck 
a pose in the mirror.  
He  seemed  to  get  inspired,  and  shuffled  out  of  the  bedroom  to  the  kitchen. 
Finding  the  bottle  of  Flintstones  vitamins,  he  pushed  and  turned  the  child-proof  cap  and 
upended  the  contents  onto  the  counter.  He  chose  a  Bam-Bam  and  carried  it  back,  with 
the empty bottle, to the bedroom.  He stood in front of the mirror and held these items up. 
"Thank  you,  thank  you.  Yes,  I've  done  it.  I've  unlocked  the  very  secret  of  life. 
With  this  pill,  just  one  a  day,  you'll  be  able  to  live  forever.  Just  take  it  and  then  think 
about  the  age  you  want  to  be,  and  you'll  be  that  age.  It  will  cure  all  death  and  disease. 
I'm  living  proof.  I may  look  like  a  small  boy  wearing  a  suit  over my  pajamas.  But  I'm 
really  a  man,  a  brilliant  scientist  who  developed  this  life-saving  treatment.  Why  the 
pajamas?  Well,  they're  comfy.  And  one  of  the  advantages  of  my  treatment  is  that  you 
can  wear  whatever  you  want  now,  regardless  of  age.  Why  the  suit?  Well,  this  is  an 
important press conference, isn't it?  Now for a demonstration" 
The boy popped  the vitamin and chewed.  He puffed his cheeks  full of  air,  raised 
his  arms  above  his  head  like  he  was  growing  to  their  height,  and  stomped  around  the 
bedroom like Frankenstein's monster.

"The  still  mind  of  the  sage  is  the  mirror  of  heaven  and  earth,  the  glass  of  all 
things."  -Chuang Tzu 

"I have to make sure you understand the risks associated with this clinical trial." 
"Of course I understand.  I signed the paper." 
"I  know.  Listen,  this  trial  is  not  like  others  you  may  have  heard  about  or 
participated in.  It has possible side effects of a qualitatively different order." 
"The paper said it could kill me.  What more is there to know?  I saw the effect of 
this disease on my father.  It was much worse than death.  I'm prepared to take that risk." 
"It's  true  there  is  a  risk  of  fatal  organ  damage,  but  even  if  it  proves  safe  in  that 
respect,  there  is  another  cause  for  concern.  Like  you  said,  there  are  fates  worse  than 
death." 
The  old  man  frowned  and  settled  more  deeply  into  his  chair.  He'd  have  to  hear 
this sermon out. 
"To  attack  the  cause  of  Alzheimer's  disease,"  the  neurologist  began,  "the  drug 
obviously  has  to  act  on  the  source  of  the  disease:  the  brain.  These  are  the  questions  our 
animal  trials  really  can't  answer: What will be  the  total  effect  of  the  drug  on your mind? 
What will be the side effects on your personality? Your memory?" 
"Wait, isn't the drug designed to fix all that?  Otherwise, what's the point?" 
"We  believe  the  drug  to  be  effective  on  the  causes  of  Alzheimer's.  In  a  perfect 
system,  that  would  also  cure  the  symptoms.  But  that might  not  necessarily  be  the  case. 
The causes and symptoms of a neurological disease are not always so directly related." 
"I don't understand." 
"Your  brain  isn't  like  your  other  organs.  We  have  very  effective  stem  cell 
therapies  to  repair  damaged  livers  and hearts,  for  example.  But we  can't  just  repair your 
brain  any  more  than  we  could  give  you  a  brain  transplant  and  hope  you'd  still  be  you. 
The  relationship  between  your  mind  and  your  brain  is  very  highly  nuanced.  It's  nearly 
impossible  to  design  a  drug  that  will  repair  pathologies  but  leave  normal  functioning 
unimpaired." 
The old man leaned forward and rubbed the coarse stubble on his chin.  He wasn't 
getting it. 
The doctor said, "Let me see if I can clarify this.  Do you believe in the soul?" 
"The soul?  Of course I do." 
"OK.  Good.  Now pretend you don't." 
"What?" 
"The  existence  of  the  soul  muddies  the  waters  for  doctors  in  my  field.  For  the 
sake of discussion,  consider  that  all you are  is  in your head and nowhere else.  Who you 
are is all represented physically by  that piece of meat between your ears.  Emotions are a 
certain  set  of  chemical  reactions  and  nothing  else.  Memories  are  relationships  between 
neurons  and  nothing  else.  You  come  into my  office  and  complain,  'I  seem  to  be  sad  all 
the time.'  So, I do a blood test and find you have a low level of endorphins.  I have to ask 
myself,  did  the  low  endorphins  cause  your  sadness  or  did  your  sadness  cause  the  low 

endorphins?  There's really no quantitative way to tell at that point.  It's all the same in the 
brain.  Memories  and  emotions  cause  and  are  caused  by  the  chemical  and  electrical 
reactions in that very material lump of flesh." 
"This  disease  isn't  a  bad  mood,  doctor.  I'm  losing  my  mind.  I  just  want  it  to

stop." 

next." 

"Here's  the  bottom  line.  The  drugs may  stop  the  degeneration  of  your  brain,  but 
they  may  not  be  truly  precise.  They  may  'repair'  things  that  don't  need  to  be  repaired. 
We  think  the collateral damage  to  the healthy cells will be minimal, but  there's no  telling 
what even a small effect may have on you." 
"You must have a guess." 
"We  can  speculate  on  a  range  of  possibilities,  none  much  more  likely  than  the 

"Let me have it." 
"It  could  kill  you.  It  could  cure  you.  It  could  accelerate  the  disease.  Even with 
successful  treatment,  you  might  experience  hallucinations.  You  might  mistake  those 
hallucinations  for memories.  Your memories might  become,  in  a  sense,  rewritten.  You 
might relieve memories as if they were happening all over again.  You might have trouble 
separating your dreams from reality." 
"So, you're saying that, as soon as I pop one of these pills, I can't really be sure of 
anything anymore?  I could go crazy and never know it?" 
"Well,  I'd  know.  And  that  data  would  be  highly  valuable  to  others  in  your 
condition" 
"Great." 
The old man  left  the clinic clutching a  small white paper bag.  A  car was waiting 
for  him  outside.  Though  he  hadn't  had  any  critical  short-term  lapses,  the  home  did  not 
allow  him  to  drive  himself  anywhere  as  a  precaution.  He  looked  at  his  watch.  Off 
schedule.  Of  course,  with  these  treatments  he'd  probably  have  to modify  his  schedule  a 
bit.  The  doctor  wanted  him  to  come  in  every  morning  for  the  first  several  weeks  to 
monitor  progress.  That  was  OK.  He  had  plenty  of  time.  He  usually  spent  these  early 
hours  in  the  lounge watching  television.  He wouldn't miss  that  too much.  As  long as he 
made it home for gardening hour. 
With  their  controlled  diets,  they'd  never  be  allowed  to  eat  the  vegetables  they 
cultivated,  so most  used  their  tiny  plots  for  annuals.  They'd  select  seeds  appropriate  for 
the  time  of  year,  pack  them  with  enough  MiracleGro  for  a  large  chemical  explosive, 
watch the flowers blossom within a few weeks, then cut them and start over again.  They 
would put the cut flowers in their rooms as trophies, boasting about their green thumbs or 
lying  that  relatives  had  brought  them.  But  the  old  man  stuck  resolutely  to  his  organic 
vegetables.  They were near  impossible  to grow,  and  if  they yielded any  crop  it was  tiny 
and shriveled.  But he didn't care. 
After  gardening  came  lunch.  The  cafeteria  served  hot  meals  that  the  old  man 
found  edible  only  about  twice  a  week.  Though  it  was  well  known  that  the  elderly  had 
reduced  appetites and  resistant  taste buds—the  food  should  have been  swimming  in  salt 
and  spice—dietary considerations specified  low-sodium, digestion-friendly pablum.  The 
ham, cured and salty by definition, was fine.  The turkey burgers and fries were relatively 
foolproof.  Attempts  at  ethnic  food,  well,  the  results  were  what  one  would  expect.  He 
knew  the  schedule  by  heart.  Today  was  Tofu  Szechuan.  So,  he  stuck  to  his  turkey 

6 

sandwich,  which  he  could  assemble  from  the  deli  bar  any  time.  Toasted  sourdough 
bread.  One  slice of  low-fat provolone  cheese.  Two  thick  slices of  turkey.  Lettuce  from 
the  salad  bar  instead  of  the  withered  leaves  in  the  deli.  Cherry  tomatoes  instead  of  the 
pale pink slices of off-season beefsteaks. 
After  lunch,  he  could  choose  between  a  monitored  walk  around  the  grounds,  a 
game of boccie, or "swimnastics."  He usually sneaked off to his room and pulled out  the 
GameBoy.  It  was  an  older  model  that  his  grandson  no  longer  used,  but  the  old  man 
couldn't  tell the difference.  The doctor told him that solving mental puzzles  in adulthood 
reduced  the  risk  factor  for Alzheimer's.  He didn't know  if  it was  too  late  for  this  to help 
him now, but he figured it couldn't hurt. 
At  around  2  o'clock  the  "entertainment"  showed  up.  This  meant  a  group  of 
performing  kids  from  a  local marching  band,  piano  class,  or  Jazzercise  troupe.  The  old 
man attended these regularly, but with skepticism.  He could tell almost immediately if it 
would  be  worth  watching  simply  by  gauging  the  median  age  of  the  children  involved. 
Teens  obviously  did  not  want  to  be  there,  and  obscured  their  scorn  poorly.  Kids  under 
the age of 8 were simply frightened out of their wits, and often sat paralyzed unable to go 
on until cattle-prodded by their handlers.  Some of  the residents  found this cute.  The old 
man did not,  and  favored  8  to  11  year olds.  They were old  enough  to have  some  degree 
of self-awareness, but young enough not to know what to do with it.  He tried to enjoy the 
performances  critically,  resisting  the  obvious  vampiric  spectacle  of  the  arrangement,  but 
he  had  caught  himself  on  several  occasions  staring  longingly  at  these  budding  humans, 
who were so effortlessly genuine. 
After  exhibition  of  the  day's  Hayes  Code-era  film,  the  home  brought  in  a  psych 
worker to lead a discussion with residents.  Today's theme was the importance of change. 
"Maintaining  a  dynamic  attitude  is  a  way  to  keep  your  mind  and  body  healthy. 
Try  to  break  free  from  your  routine.  If  you  walk  the  grounds  every  afternoon,  try  the 
swim aerobics  instead, or, at  least,  take a different path around  the garden.  It's never  too 
late  to  learn  something  new.  It  may  seem  like  your  options  are  limited,  but  there  are 
plenty  of  things  to  do  even  in  your  own  room,  or  the  common  area.  Many  elderly  folks 
enjoy knitting.  One of  the nurses visits  the  library every day.  Ask her  to bring you back 
a book about something you've never done.  You could learn all about a different country, 
or  read  all  of  the works  of  an  author you  like.  Take  advantage  of your golden years,  it's 
never too late for dynamic personal growth." 
"Change is overrated," interjected the man. 
"Excuse me?" 
"They  tell  us  the  same  thing  all  the  time:  break  out  of  your  routine!  Mix  things 
up!  Learn  something  new!  Keep  up  with  the  Joneses!  It's  all  bull.  I  know  what  you 
want.  The  harder we  work  the  easier we  forget  that we're  going  to  die.  And  hey,  that's 
cool.  Nice  try.  But,  I have  a different  take on  things.  You  live  as  long  as  I do  and you 
find  you've  lived  through many periods when you do  the  same  thing day  in  and day out. 
And I've decided that they're not any better than the periods where everything's uncertain, 
they're  just  different.  So, maybe  you  go  to  the  same  3  restaurants  all  the  time.  But  you 
try everything on the menu.  Or you have the same thing every time, but you notice, each 
time,  how  it  was  so  subtly  different  from  the  last.  Maybe  it's  only  the  100th  time  you 
have  something  that  you  realize why  you  like  it  so much.  Maybe,  by  doing  nothing,  by 
not  thinking  about  every  decision,  your  mind  is  allowed  to  wander,  and  you  make 

7 

connections that you never thought of before.  Maybe stillness even allows you to see and 
experience things in different times and different dimensions.  I've seen such things." 
By  this  point,  the  nurses  had  already  intervened  to  help  the  old  man  out  of  the 
discussion  circle,  but  he  could  see  some  of  the  others  smiling  and  nodding  as  he  was 
pulled away. 
After  dinner,  the  old  man  popped  his  pill.  Nurses  started  escorting  the  more 
incapacitated  residents back  to  their  rooms.  The building was  locked down.  But  the old 
man  convinced  one of  the nurses  to  let  him out  for  a  final  short walk  around  the garden. 
The nurse stood at the door and watched as he ambled over to the fenced off quarter acre 
adjacent to the courtyard fountain. 
Before  the  old  man  reached  his  vegetables,  he  noticed  another  person  in  the 
garden.  A man from facilities was plowing one of the plots into oblivion, just driving the 
flowers and stems back into the earth. 
The old man said, "I see we have a new opening." 
The facilities guy stopped briefly, nodded somberly, and resumed. 
The  old man  bent  over  his  small  garden  and  delicately  touched  the  leaves.  Then 
he  noticed,  in  the  near  center  of  the  plot,  terminating  from  a  tangle  of  thick  green  vine, 
the biggest, roundest, reddest tomato he had ever seen.

"The sage's mind in stillness is the mirror of Heaven and earth, the glass of the ten 
thousand things."  -Master Zhuang 

The man  counted  himself  lucky  to  work  at  a  job  where  informality  was  the  rule. 
Nobody  expected  him  to  show  up  in  a  suit  and  tie.  He  called  no  one  "sir"  or  "boss." 
And,  most  impressively,  he  could  show  up  anytime  he  wanted,  within  reason.  So  he 
showed  up  at  8  AM  every  morning  on  the  dot.  It  seemed  unnecessary  to  most  of  his 
workmates, but he'd done  the math,  it all made  sense.  If he  left any  later, because of  the 
traffic,  it  would  actually  take  him  as much  as  15 minutes  longer  to  get  into work.  If  he 
left  earlier  there  were  fewer  buses,  so  he'd  probably  make  it  to  work  at  about  the  same 
time  anyway.  Try  explaining  this  to  a  bunch  of  recent  college  grads  who  still  felt  that 
sleeping until noon was a cardinal virtue. 
So  he'd  be  out  of  bed  by  6:30  to  stop  the  pain  of  the  buzzing  alarm.  He'd 
experimented  with  brisk  morning  exercises  before  realizing  that  the  nerve  pathways 
between  brain  and  limbs  did  only  limited  throughput  until  doused  with  very  hot  water. 
So  it was  right  into  the  shower.  Then he prepared one of  three  standard breakfasts. This 
day, he had the english muffin, one scrambled egg, orange juice, and yogurt.  He enjoyed 
exactly one cup of coffee before leaving for work, brewed from fresh ground beans using 
the traditional cone filter method. 
Very  few  people  ever  got  off  the  bus  at  his  stop.  His  office  was  in  a  post-
industrial  neighborhood  that  had  yet  to  attract  many  post-industrial  industries.  So  the 
only  people  who  got  off  with  him  were  either  lost  or  homeless,  and  those  people  didn't 
keep  rigid  schedules.  The man  had  inadvertently  developed  a mental  game  that,  once  it 
got  into  his  head,  he  couldn't  stop  playing,  though  he  knew  it was  stupid.  It was  called: 
Don't Pull the Stop Cord.  The object was to not pull the stop cord unless he was the only 
person  getting  off  at  the  stop.  It  was  a  game  of  chicken  with  the  other  passengers  that 
only he knew they were playing.  Wait too long to pull the cord and he risked missing the 
stop, but pull it too early and he could lose.  He had a whole scoring system based on the 
number  of  people  on  the  bus,  the  number  of  people  who  eventually  got  off  at  the  stop, 
and  when  the  cord  was  pulled.  He  wished  he  could  stop  playing,  but  the  game  concept 
was an intellectual virus.  Telling himself to stop only reminded him that he couldn't help 
it. 

At work, he  slipped  into his cubicle without a word  to his coworkers  and  listened 
to  classical music  through  a  pair  of  large  studio monitor  headphones.  A  stack  of  papers 
awaited  him  in  his  inbox.  He  grabbed  the  entire  column  and  inverted  it  onto  his  desk, 
slid the first sheet off of the top, and started working.  The man had no illusions about his 
job, he was a paper pusher.  He did one thing, and one thing only.  By the end of the day, 
the  stack  of  papers  in  his  inbox  would  be  full,  but  he'd  have  processed  all  of  the 
documents from the day before.  They hadn't determined a way to teach a computer to do 
his  job,  but  he  didn't  think  they  ever  would.  Though  repetitive,  every  document  to 
process  represented  a  complicated  problem.  Documents,  depending  on  their  content, 
needed  to  be  routed,  abstracted,  indexed,  sequenced,  or  categorized.  The  man  was  a

necessary bottleneck in the flow of  information that kept the company running smoothly. 
He  had  many  years  experience  at  this  now,  so  replacing  him  would  take  months  of  on-
the-job  training.  He  knew  enough  not  to  teach  his  coworkers  too  much  about  what  he 
did.  In a  real way he was more  irreplaceable  and  integral  to  the company  than  the CEO. 
Of course, he didn't make as much money.  But he didn't care. 
At  about  the quarter mark  of  the day's  pile,  the man pulled up  a  paper,  the  top  of 
which  bent  back  limply  like  a  dead  flower.  He  pushed  the  right  edge  up  between  his 
thumb  and  forefinger.  The  angle  of  the  paper  edge  shifted  as  he  pushed,  and  it  sliced 
through the skin on the thumb.  He sucked air through his teeth and clamped down the cut 
with his other hand.  A beginner's mistake.  He  shook his head.  Drawing away his other 
hand,  he  held  the  injured  finger  up  for  a  closer  look.  Just  a  tiny  line  of  red.  But  above 
that,  he  noticed  for  the  first  time  that  he  had  dirt  under  his  fingernails.  He  couldn't 
remember  the  last  time  he  had  got  them  muddy.  Was  his  hygiene  so  lax?  He  took  a 
bathroom break and scrubbed his hands. 
At  lunchtime  he  discretely  ate  his  turkey  sandwich  on  the  cross-town  bus.  The 
driver  knew  him well  enough  not  to  enforce  the  no  food  rule,  and  he  had  a  soft  spot  for 
the man, because every afternoon he used his  lunch hour  to ride  to  the nursing home and 
visit his  father.  On  the  return  trip, he  often  looked more  sullen  than when  he  had  come, 
but he kept with the routine.  These days, his face tended not to register anything. 
The man walked into his father's room to see him staring into the top-most dresser 
drawer.  He didn't hear  the  intrusion and continued to look  in  the drawer as  the man  took 
a seat on the corner of the bed. 
"What are you doing, Dad?" 
His  father  jumped  a  little  and  looked  over  his  shoulder,  back  at  the  drawer,  and 
then back at his son again.  He closed the drawer and sat down, their shoulders brushing. 
"What's in there, huh?" 
"Gears.  Springs.  Other clockwork" 
The two sat in silence for a while. 
“So, how are you doing, dad?  Are you having a good day today?” 
“Um.  The food here is terrible.” 
“I know.  Here, I brought you some olives.  Nice and salty.  Don't worry, no pits” 
He  accepted  the  small  container  of  rich  purple  globes  floating  in  brine,  popped 
one into his mouth and chewed quietly, nodding. 
“How are they?  Good?  What have you been doing today?” 
“Nothing on.” 
“What?" 
"Never anything good on." 
"Oh, the TV.  OK.  Let's see if we can find something.” 
The man reached up to the suspended television set and flicked it on. 
“You won't find anything.” 
He spun the ancient dial, encountering static at nearly every interval. 
“Don't know why they don't have cable.” 
“Cable  is  naughty.  Can't  let  us  see  naked  ladies.  We're  children,  you  see. 
Children.” 
“I know, dad.” 
The man stopped on one of the channels that afforded marginally clear resolution.

“Do you remember this show?” asked the man. 
“Of course I do.  My memory is just fine.” 
“Man,  this was  bad.  I  like  John  Ritter  well  enough,  I  guess.  But,  what  a  stupid 
show.” 
Just  then  the  station  interrupted  for  a bit of breaking news.  A  boy who had gone 
missing a week past had been found dead. 
“Well that sucks.” 
But  he  looked  over  at  his  father  and  saw  him  staring  wide-eyed  at  the  screen 
during  the  entire  interruption.  When  it  was  over,  and  the  station  switched  back  to  John 
Ritter  tripping  over  an ottoman,  the man's  father  looked  at  him with  a kind of  awareness 
he hadn't exhibited in months. 
“Son.” 
“Dad, what is it?” 
“Son, you have to believe me.  Say you'll believe me.  This is very important.  I'm 
not crazy.  Say you'll believe me.” 
“I believe you.  Of course I do.  Go on.” 
“They say I'm losing my mind but I'm not.  None of it's real, you see.  They cured 
death.  They  cured  death  but  didn't  know  what  it  would  do  to  us.  Our  brains  couldn't 
handle  it  so  they  did  all  this,  stuck  us  here.  But  I  can  see  it.  And  now  they're  trying  to 
stop the one who did it before he invented the drug.  Do you understand?” 
“No.  What do you mean?  I don't...” 
"The one who did it, it's..." 
But  then  it  passed,  and  a  glazed  look  seemed  to  come  over  his  father's  eyes  and 
they moved back to the screen. 
“When is my wife coming home?” 
“I don't know, dad.” 
When  he  got  back  to  the  office,  he  tore  into  his  pile  of  papers.  He  worked  at  a 
frenzied  pace,  scanning  and  digesting whole  documents  in  seconds,  hardly  blinking.  He 
became, at  that moment, a kind of paperwork savant, hardly even thinking about what he 
was  doing.  He  burned  through  the  whole  stack,  and  the  stack  for  the  next  day,  and 
finished  well  before  quitting  time.  Then  he  just  sat  and  stared  at  the  cubicle  wall,  in  a 
trance.  Improbably,  one  of  his  office  mates,  a  project  manager,  noticed  this,  and  he 
ambled over. 
“Hey, buddy, what's up?  Are you OK.” 
It  took  a  few  seconds  for  the man  to  snap  out  of  it  and  focus  his  attention  on  the 
interloper. 
“Um... yeah, I guess.  Did you know, when I was a boy, about 9 or 10, I believed 
that I was the reincarnation of a very important person?  Some big inventor, if I recall.” 
“Oh.... yeah.  Is that right?  Well, I guess it's better than being the reincarnation of 
some  loser.  Heh,  why  doesn't  anybody  ever  think  they're  the  reincarnation  of  the 
gardener, or something?" 
“God, I remember that time so well, it's almost in my bones.  I did the same thing 
every single day.  I think, if somebody built an exact replica of my house at that time, and 
put  me  asleep  in  my  bed,  I'd  wake  up  and  do  everything  I  did  then,  automatically. 
I 
wouldn't even  remember  that  I was an adult now.  I'd  just accept  it.  Who knows, maybe 
that's  how  this  is.  Maybe  I'm  really  an  old man  but  I woke  up  in my  old  bed  in my  old 

11 

apartment  this morning,  and  so  I  came  into  work.  Or maybe  we  live  whole  lives  in  our 
dreams,  and  forget  them  when  we  wake  up.  We're  always  the  same  age,  we  just  dream 
we have childhoods or grow old or die.” 
"Hmm. 
Interesting,  but  don't  go  thinking  you're  some  original  philosophical 
genius, or anything.  Sounds a lot like Zhuangzi." 
The man was taken aback. 
"What?" 
"Chinese philosopher.  My  college degree was  in philosophy.  Zhuangzi dreamed 
he was a butterfly. When he woke up, he didn't know if he was a man dreaming he was a 
butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he was a man.  Or something.  It's been a while." 
"Huh.  That's kinda nice.  What does it mean?" 
"I don't know.  Maybe that things can be many different things at once, depending 
on your frame of reference." 
"Well, some things seem pretty absolute." 
"Yeah, well, philosophy doesn't exactly pay the bills, does it?" 
"No, I guess not." 
"Some  of  us  are  going  to  go  out  tonight  and,  you  know,  get  wasted.  Wanna 
come?" 
The man considered it.  He never did anything with the people from work.  But he 
had more important things to do. 
"I  don't  think  so.  I'm  done  with my work  here.  I  think  I'm  going  to  go  pick my 
son up from school.  I don't spend nearly enough time with him."
