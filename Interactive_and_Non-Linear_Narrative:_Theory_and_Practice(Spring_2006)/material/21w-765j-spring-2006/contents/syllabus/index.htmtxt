***** Course Description *****
The contemporary understanding of communication and narrative is quickly
shifting in a world where media is ubiquitous. This course explores the
properties of non-linear, multi-linear, and interactive forms of narratives as
they have evolved from print to digital media. The "language of new media" is
the thematic used in this course to discuss contemporary and historic forms of
non-linear narrative. Writers on communication culture, gaming, television,
digital aesthetics, contemporary art and film, as well as synchronic narrative
will be addressed. The course is structured as a theory and practice class:
students will produce short papers and a final media project. The focus is to
develop critical tools to analyze contemporary media as well as a minimal level
of practical implementation. We will look at writers including Borges, Julian
Dibbell, Steven Johnson, Friedrich Kittler, Jan Murray, Katie Salen and Eric
Zimmerman, films by Quentin Tarantino and Chris Marker, and game culture
platforms such as Second Life, LARPs and ARGs, and various MMOs. This course is
open to students of all levels, with assignment modification for graduate
students.
Students will develop digital and non-digital collaborative projects that
explore the complex relationships of narrative and interactivity in a hands-on,
workshop format. The goal of this course is to expand our understanding of
narrative and refine our skills in the critical analysis of interactive formats
through a combination of project development, readings on the theory and
practice of non-linear/interactive narrative, and close analysis of digital and
non-digital narratives.
