Optional Problem Set 7 
If you would like feedback from your TA, please turn your 
problem set in by 4PM on Tuesday, December 2nd. 

1. With the aid of  three-dimensional drawings, provide a clear rationale for the products 
that are observed  in the following transformations.  Your rat ionale must  include the 
mechanism for each transformation.  Hint:   Think cyclohexane chair!

6.  In the reaction illustrated below, the desired product from a simple Friedel–Crafts 
acylation (A) was not observed.  Instead , and isomeric  product  (B) was generated through a 
more complex route that also involves Friedel–Crafts chemistry.  Please provide a detailed 
mechanism for this unexpected  process.
