1. a)  The Cope eliminat ion generally prov ides the least substituted alkene product.  Analyze 
the selectivity of the following reaction in the same way that we analyzed the select ivity of 
the Hofmann elimination in lecture.   Provide an explanat ion for the observed  selectivity.

b)  Whi le the Cope elimination is a good way to convert  an amine N-oxide to an alkene 
and a hydroxylamine,  in some cases the reverse Cope elimination can  be used to convert 
an alkene to an amine N-oxide.  Using what you know about the mechanism for the Cope 
elimination, propose a mechanism for the following reverse Cope el imination.

3.  As you know,  carbonly groups display characteristic IR resonances in the 1600–1800 
cm–1  region.  Different carbonyl  groups display d ifferent stretching frequencies.  In 
general,  the stronger the C=O bond, the higher the stretching frequency.  Using what you 
know about resonance stabilization of carboxylic acid derivatives, explain the following 
trend in IR stretching frequencies.

Stop each reaction at 50% conversion 
and examine the recovered starting 
material  for incorporation of ∅.

Under acidic hydrolysis cond itions, would you expect more ∅ incorporation 
into the amide (eq 1) or the ester (eq 2)?  Your answer should include the 
mechanism for these reactions. 

5.  Provide syntheses of the following molecules.  All of  the carbon atoms should 
come from the given starting materials.   You may use any common reagents.

6.  Phosgene is a highly reactive acylat ing reagent that can be used to synthesize a large 
variety of carboxylic  acid derivatives.  Unfortunately, it  is also a highly toxic gas that was 
once used as a chemical warfare agent.  Triphosgene is now used in place of phosgene 
because it is an easy  to handle solid.  In the presence of catalytic chloride  ion, triphosgene 
decomposes to form three equivalents of phosgene in situ.   Provide a detailed mechanism 
for this decomposition process.
