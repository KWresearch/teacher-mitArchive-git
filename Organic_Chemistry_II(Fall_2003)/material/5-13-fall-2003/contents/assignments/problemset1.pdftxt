NOTE:  If mass spectrometry (MS) data are provided, the highest molecular ion given corresponds to the 
molecular ion (M+ ), unless otherwise noted. 

1.	

In class we derived a formula for calculating the “index of hydrogen deficiency,” which is equal to the 
sum of the number of rings and π-bonds in an organic molecule.  We showed that number of atoms of 
each element is multiplied by a factor (hereafter called “deficiency factor”) in this equation (C: 1, H: –1/2, 
O: 0, etc.).
a.	 Derive the deficiency factor for phosphorus (P), using triphenylphosphine (C6H5) 3P, a common 
laboratory reagent (e.g. Wittig reactions),  as the basis for your calculations. 
b.	 Derive the deficiency factor for phosphorus (P), using triphenylphosphine oxide (C6H5) 3P=O  (a 
byproduct in the Wittig reaction), as the basis for your calculations. 
c.	 Why are the two factors derived different?  In other words, what do you need to know about each 
element in a particular organic molecule?  Based on these considerations, write a general 
mathematical expression for the deficiency factor for any element. 

2.	 a.  Draw the structures of the 4 compounds that satisfy the following experimental data: 
EA (found): C, 60.96; H, 15.35; N, 23.70 
MS: 59 
b.	 There is a broad signal at 2970 cm–1 in the IR spectrum of this unknown compound.  Which of the 
structure(s) that you drew for your answer to 2a can you eliminate from consideration based on this 
information?  Explain. 

3.	 a.  Draw the structures of the 6 molecules that satisfy all of the following experimental data, including 
enantiomers, diastereomers, alkene isomers: 
EA (found): C, 66.63; H, 11.18 
MS: 72 
IR: 3435 (broad), 1645 (weak) 
b.	 When this unknown compound is treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, the signal at 3435 cm–1 
disappears from the IR spectrum, and a strong, sharp signal at 1685 cm–1 appears.  Which of the 
structures(s) that you drew for your answer in 3a can you eliminate from consideration based on 
this information? 
c.	 How would you distinguish between the 2 remaining structures?

cm–1) and 2 (IR: 1705 cm–1)  (both  C8H8O 2) each gave two different products (i.e. all 4 products (total) in 
the 2 reactions are different from one another).  Deduce the structures of 1 and 2.
