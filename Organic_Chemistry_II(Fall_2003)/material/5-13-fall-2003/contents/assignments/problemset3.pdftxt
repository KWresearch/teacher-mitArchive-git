1.	 Problem 15-30, Wade, p. 676 (15-30, p. 687 in 4th edition) 

2. 	 Problem 15-33, Wade, p. 676 (15-33, p. 688 in 4th edition) 

3. 	 Using retrosynthetic analysis, propose a synthesis of each of the molecules below using a Diels-
Alder reaction in each case.  Starting with the Diels-Alder reaction you decide to use, write your 
synthesis in the “forward” direction, showing all steps and reagents necessary.

4. 	 Base-promoted elimination of 7-bromo-2,4-cycloheptadien-1-one provides cycloheptatrienone 
as expected, but in the five-membered ring series, only a “dimeric” product is obtained.  Explain.

5. 	 Compound A undergoes a ring-opening reaction when heated at 100 °C, but no reaction occurs 
when C is subjected to the same conditions.  Suggest a mechanism for the conversion of A to 
B, identify the type of reaction involved, and explain why C does not undergo a similar 
transformation.

6. 	 Name the type of pericyclic reaction involved in each of the following reactions.  Classify each 
according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.  That is, indicate how many electrons are involved 
in each case and comment on the stereochemical course of the reaction where relevant. 

7. 	 Propose a synthesis of D from 2,6-dimethylphenol, iodomethane, and trans-1-bromo-2-butene. 
Use any inorganic reagents (e.g. acids, bases, Lewis acids, etc.) necessary, but no other 
carbon-containing compounds.  Write your synthesis in the forward direction, and show arrow-
pushing mechanisms for each step.
