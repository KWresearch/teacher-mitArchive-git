Practice Exam #4

5.13: Organic Chemistry II

Fall 2003


•	 Midterm exam #4 will be held on Friday, December 5, 
from 12–1pm. 

•	 Ten points will be subtracted from your exam if you take it in the
 wrong room. 

•	 Notes, books, and calculators will not be allowed in the exam. 

•	 You will be free to use molecular models during the exam. 

•	 You will be given a periodic table. 

•	 The exam will cover reading (Ch. 22) and lecture material 
through Unit VII (Monday, December 1st).  Knowledge of prior 
material (5.12 & 5.13) is also  assumed. 

•	 For best results, take this test as if it were your exam  (without a key in 
50 minutes!).  That way , you'll know what areas to work on before you 
get to the real exam.

   Practice, Practice, Practice!!!
