Practice Exam #3

5.13: Organic Chemistry II

Fall 2003


•	 Midterm exam #3 will be held on Wednesday, November 12, 
from 12–1pm . 

•	 Notes, books, and calculators will not be allowed in the exam. 

•	 You will be free to use molecular models during the exam. 

•	 You will be given a periodic table. 

•	 The exam will cover reading (Ch. 19–21) and lecture material 
through Unit V (Wednesday , November 5). 

•	 For best results, take this test as if it were your exam  (without a key in 
50 minutes!).  That way , you'll know what areas to work on before you 
get to the real exam.

   Practice, Practice, Practice!!!

stop the reaction at 50%  conversion 
and examine the recovered anhydride 
for incorporation of ∅ 

∅ = isotopically  labeled oxygen 

In analogy with the discussion in class regarding the labeling studies of acyl chlorides, esters, 
and amides,  carefully explain what level ("high" or "low")  of ∅ incorporation you expect to 
observe in the recovered anhydride.  Your answer should include the mechanism for this 
hydrolysis reaction. 

6. Methyl acetimidate (A)  is hydrolyzed  in aqueous sod ium hydroxide to give mainly acetamide 
and methanol (eq 1) .  In aqueous acid, A hydrolyzes to give primarily methyl acetate and 
ammonium  ion (eq 2).
