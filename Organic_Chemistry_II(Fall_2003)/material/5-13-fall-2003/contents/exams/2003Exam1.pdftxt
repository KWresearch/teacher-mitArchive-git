1.	

(36 points  total)  Use  the  information provided  below  and  the  IR  and NMR  spectra  on  the 
next page to answer the following questions. 

a.	

(10 points) Determine the molecular formula that satisfies the following data (circle your 
EA (found):  C, 37.02; H, 2.22; N, 18.50; and M+ = 227 
final answer): 

b.	

(6  points)  Calculate  the  Index  of  Hydrogen  Deficiency  (IHD)  for  the  molecule  in  a , 
above (circle your final answer). 

c.	

(5  points)  An  IR  spectrum  of  the  molecule  in  a  appears  on  the  following  page.  What 
functional group or groups correspond(s)  to  the 2 most  intense peaks  in  the spectrum? 
Draw the structure of this/these group(s), showing all bonds (i.e. single, double, triple). 

d.	

(10  points)  Using  the  information  in  a, b ,  and  c ,  above,  and  the  1H  NMR  and  13C  NMR 
spectra  on  the  next  page,  determine  a  structure  of  this  unknown  molecule  that  is 
consistent with all data.  Draw  the  structure  of  this molecule  below (circle  your  final 
answer). 

e.	

(5 points) Provide  an  explanation for the fact that the singlet at 9.4 ppm  in  the 1H NMR 
spectrum appears so far downfield. 

f. 

(EXTRA  CREDIT,  5  points):  What  is  this  compound,  and  what  is  its  most  notorious 
physical property?

(20  points)  Using only  1H  NMR  spectroscopy, how would  you conclusively distinguish 
between  all 3  isomers  (ortho, meta, and para) of bromopheno l?  Be  as  spec i f ic   as  
necessary  in  order  to  differentiate ortho from meta, meta from para, and ortho from 
para.  (Suggestion: Use chemical structures as part of your answer.)

(20 points)  An unknown compound X (containing only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen) has 
m/z  =  172  (M+)  and  1 1 5 ,  and  its  13C  NMR  spectrum  below.  When  treated  with  lithium 
aluminum hydride  in ether, a single compound Y  is produced, and  its 1H NMR spectrum is 
given  below.  In  the  space  below  the  NMR  spectra  at  the  bottom  of  the  page,  draw  the 
structures of X and Y.  Circle your final answers and clearly indicate which is compound X 
(12 points) and which is compound Y (8 points).

4.  (24  points)  Mass  spectrometry  was  performed  on  5-phenyl-2-pentanone  (below),  and 
several signals corresponding to fragments (Mf  ) were observed  in  the spectrum.  Write  the 
+
m/z value observed for M+  in  the box provided (3 points).  In each question below  the m/z 
value  for  Mf  is  provided.  Draw  the  structure  of Mf  in  the  corresponding  box  (3  points 
+

each).  Also,  write  the molecular  weight of  the  neu t ra l   species  (Mneutral)  formed  in  each 
fragmentation  in  the boxes on  the  right  (1 point each).  Finally, draw  the structure of each 
neutral)  in  the  boxes  on  the  right  (3  points  each).  BE  SURE  TO  INDICATE  WHETHER
