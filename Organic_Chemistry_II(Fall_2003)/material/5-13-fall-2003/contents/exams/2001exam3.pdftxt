Directions:  Closed book exam, no books, notebooks, notes, etc. allowed. 
Calculators are not allowed.  However, molecular model sets are permitted. 

Please read through the entire exam before beginning, in order to make sure that 
you have all the pages and in order to gauge the relative difficulty of each 
question. Budget your time accordingly. 

Show all of your work if you wish to receive partial credit. 

You should have 10 pages total:  7 exam pages  including this page, 1 page of 
reference  information, and 2 blank pages  for scratchwork.

1.  (12  points  total) 

(a)	 5 points.  Draw  the structure of  the protonated  form of azulene and briefly 
justify your prediction.

(b)	 7 points.  Barrelene  is an  intriguing organic molecule and was  first 
synthesized approximately 40 years ago.  Draw a  three-dimensional 
atomic orbital representation of the π–system, using the framework given. 
Do you expect  this molecule  to show aromatic character?  Use your 
drawing  and  a  few  appropriate words  to  justify  your  answer  in  the 
space  provided  below  the  structures.

Consider  the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction between each 
compound below and bromine.  In each case, circle  the appropriate word, 
indicating  whether  the  molecule  shown  undergoes  substitution  faster  or 
slower  than  benzene  would  under  identical  conditions.

3.  (15  points) 
(a)  For both of  the  reactions below, draw  the  structure of  all  non-
equivalent  electrophilic  aromatic  monosubstitution  products, 
whether or not they are actually formed in the reaction. 
(b)  Next,  for each case, circle  the major  product. 
(c)  Finally, which  reaction would  you expect  to be more  selective?  That  is, 
which reaction will  form  the greater percentage of  its major product? 
Explain.

Which  is  the more selective  reaction  (reaction A  or  reaction B)?  Explain.

4.  (20  points) K.C. Nicolaou's  research group  synthesized many of  the 
endiandric acid natural products using a common starting material (the diol 
shown), and subjecting  it  to 3 reactions  in sequence, 2 of which were 
pericyclic reactions. 

Draw  the  structure  of  the  two  products  in  the  boxes  provided,  clearly 
showing relative stereochemistry, where appropriate.  Where  indicated, write 
the  number  of  electrons  involved  each  pericyclic  reaction,  and  indicate 
whether  the  mode  of  cyclization  is  disrotatory  or  conrotatory by circling 
the correct word.  Finally, redraw  the  final product of  this sequence, clearly 
showing  its  relative  stereochemistry  (All  products  in  this  sequence  are 
formed as racemates; either correct relative stereochemistry will receive full 
credit).

5.  (20 points) In  the space provided, propose an efficient synthetic route  to  the 
target molecule shown in the box from the starting material shown next to it. 
Assume  that  your  "stockroom"  of  available  reagents  includes  any  inorganic 
compounds , benzene , tr ipheny lphosph ine,  and  any   organic  compound 
containing  3 or  fewer carbon atoms.  Your synthesis should provide a way  to 
control  the  relative  stereochemistry of  the  target molecule  (but not  the 
absolute  stereochemistry).  Write  your  synthesis  in  the  forward  direction, 
showing all necessary  reagents and  relevant  reaction conditions  for each step.
