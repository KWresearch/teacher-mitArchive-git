Directions: 

Closed book exam, no books, notebooks, notes, etc. allowed. 

However, calculators, rulers, and molecular model sets arepermitted. 

Please read through the entire exam before beginning, in order to make sure that 

you have all the pages and in order to gauge the relative difficulty of each 

question. Budget your time accordingly. 

Show all of your work if you wish to receive partial credit. 

You should have 7 pages total:  5 exam pages including this page and 2 blank 

pages for scratchwork.

(18  points)  Using only  lithium  diisopropylamide  (LDA),  1,3-butadiene,  iodomethane, 
fumaric  dialdehyde,  triphenylphosphine, and any other  inorganic  reagents,  propose  a 
synthesis of trans,trans-(1,5)-cyclodecadiene.  Write  your  synthesis  in  the  forward direction 
(not  retrosynthetic  analysis),  with  the  reagents  (if  any)  required  for  each  step  above  each 
arrow. 

(This is the target molecule.)

3.  (18  points)  The  relative  energy  levels  of  the  molecular  orbitals  for  the  cyc lop ropeny l  
cation, anion, and radical can be derived using Frost’s Circle (“Polygon Rule”) (below). 
a.  (3  points) Clearly  draw  the  “zero  energy”  line  on  all  three  diagrams  below,  i.e.  for  all 
three species (cation (A.), anion (B.), radical (C.)). 
b.  (3  points)  In  the boxnext to  the  energy  level  for  each  orbital, write  “bonding”,  “non-
bonding”, or “anti-bonding”, as appropriate. 
c.  (6  points) Popu late  the orbitals  (bold  horizontal  lines)  of  each  species  (cation  (A.), 
anion  (B.),  radical  (C.)) with  the appropriate number of electrons  to  indicate  the ground 
state configuration (lowest energy) in each case. 
d.  (6 points) In the shaded, rounded boxto the right of each diagram,  indicate whether 
the species is aromatic or anti-aromatic as defined by Hückel’s rule.
