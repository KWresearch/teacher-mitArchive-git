1 .   (24   po in ts   to ta l )	 For  a l l  8  react ions  be low,  draw  the  structure  of  the 
pred icted   ma jor   product .  Obey  the  Woodward-Hoffmann  ru les  whe re  
applicable!  Clearly  indicate  stereochemistry where  relevant.  For  each  pair 
of  reactions,  indicate  which  you  would  expect  to  be  the  faster  one  and  the 
slower  one  by writing  "faster"  or  "slower"  in  the  boxes  provided.

Explain briefly.

a.  (16  points) Draw  the  products  of  all  reactions A-D  shown  below  in  the  boxes 
provided.  Clearly  ind icate  relative  stereochemistry,  where  applicable.    (If  the 
product of a given  reaction  is chiral, you need draw  only  one  of  the  two  possible 
enantiomers.)

b .   (10   po ints)  In  one  of  the  4  reactions  above,  2   p roduc ts   that  are  n o t  
enantiomeric  to  one  another  are  allowed  by  the  Woodward-Hoffmann  rules. 
Which  reaction  is  it  (i.e. A,  B,  C ,  or  D )?  Draw  the  structure  of  the  product  n o t  
formed  and  briefly  explain  why  it  is  not  observed,  even  though  the  Woodward-
Hoffmann rules do not exclude the possibility of its formation.
