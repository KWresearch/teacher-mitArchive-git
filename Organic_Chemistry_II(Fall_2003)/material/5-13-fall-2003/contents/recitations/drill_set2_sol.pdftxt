IR Spectroscopy 
[a > b] because the difference in mass across the C=C double bond is greater in a than in 
1.	
b. 
[b > c > a] because a CO triple bond is stronger than a CO double bond, which is 
stronger than a CO single bond, and the difference in mass ratios is negligible.  In other 
words, the spring constant is bigger – the spring is tighter! 
[a > b] because Fe is much heavier than C.  Put something really heavy on one end of a 
spring – it then bounces back and forth much more slowly! 
[a > b > c] because a C(sp3)-H bond is stronger than a C(sp2)-H bond, which is stronger 
than a C(sp)-H bond.  Greater p-character puts electrons further away from the carbon 
nuclei, giving the C-H bonds more covalent character (and thus strength).

13C NMR 
[a < b < c] because chemical shift goes down with increasing electron density (shielding).  
1.	
Li is best at stabilizing a positive charge, so the Li-C bond is the most polarized of the 
three.  In other words, of the three molecules, MeLi puts the biggest partial negative 
charge on carbon, and thus its carbon atom is the most shielded.  Mg is a little worse at 
stabilizing positive charge, so the carbon atom in MeMgBr has a slightly smaller partial 
negative charge than in MeLi and is slightly less shielded, and so on. 
2.	 The most electron-rich carbonyl carbon will correspond to the most “anion-like” formate 
group, and thus the most cationic metal.  (For simplicity I’m calling H a metal, too.)  
Increasing electron density corresponds to decreasing chemical shift (ppm), so the trend 
in stabilizing cations follows: Cu(II) > Zn(I) > H. 

1H NMR 
The N-arylpyrrole (the third isomer) is easily distinguishable from the first two isomers because 
it would lack the characteristic broadened singlet resulting from an N-H proton.  The first two 
are easy to tell apart because they have drastically different symmetry with respect to the pyrrole 
ring.  The pyrrole resonances for 2-aryl-4-methylpyrrole (the first isomer) would be two sharp 
singlets, while the pyrrole resonances for 2-aryl-3-methylpyrrole (the second isomer) would be a 
doublet and a triplet. 

Misc. NMR 
1.	 We’re used to thinking about things like C-C bonds, which are not very polar and have 
electron density well spread-out over both atoms.  Metals, such as the Cu atom in this 
case, are electropositive and thus repel electron density.  This effectively puts a partial 
negative charge on the methyl carbon atom.  In fact, the carbon atom, and therefore its 
protons, are so incredibly electron-rich that their NMR resonances come in below 0 ppm. 
2.	 There is so much steric bulk bumping into each other here, that there are many restricted 
rotations to think about.  First of all, each of the N-C(aryl) bonds is restricted, so the 
diisopropylphenyl groups are stuck in the plane perpendicular to the page.  Furthermore, 
each of the C(phenyl)-C(isopropyl) bonds are restricted as well – there’s that much steric 
bulk here!  That means that, for a given isopropyl group, one of the methyl groups is 

stuck pointing towards the copper atom, while the other is forever destined to be pointing 
away.  That makes them chemically distinct, and thus we see separate 1H NMR signals. 
3.  The covalent LCuCH3 complex would show only one 63Cu resonance (only one “type” of 
copper atom), while the ion-paired [L2Cu]+[Cu(CH3)3]  complex would show two 63Cu 
-
resonances (two “types” of copper atoms).
