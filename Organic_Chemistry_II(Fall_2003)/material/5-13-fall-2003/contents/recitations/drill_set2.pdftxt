5.13 Drill Problems for 9/17/03-9/24/03 

Disclaimer: I apologize for the fact that some of my problems contain metals; I just couldn’t 
resist.  However, these problems are supposed to enrich your ever-growing knowledge of 
chemistry, so that’s my excuse.  --NM 

IR Spectroscopy 
Order the following from highest to lowest frequency (cm-1) with the respect to the indicated 
vibration. 
1. 	 C=C stretch in a) 1-butene, b) 2-butene 
2. 	 CO stretch in a) methanol, b) carbon monoxide, c) formaldehyde 
3. 	 X-Cl stretch: a) C-Cl, b) Fe-Cl

13C NMR 
NMR data can give insight into the distribution of electron density in a molecule. 
1.	 Rank the following according to your expectation of increasing 13C chemical shift (ppm): 
a) MeLi, b) MeMgBr, c) Me3Al 
2.	 Based solely on the following trend in 13C chemical shift in ppm (which may or may not 
be true), rank H, Zn(II), and Cu(II) in order of increasing ability to stabilize a positive 
charge:

Misc. NMR questions 
Transition metal complexes of Arduengo carbenes are becoming increasingly important in 
organometallic catalysis.  Consider the following Arduengo carbene copper complex:

1.	 The 1H NMR resonance for the copper-bound methyl group comes in at -0.491 ppm.  In 
general, most alkyl resonances fall between 0 and 3 ppm.  Qualitatively, why does this 
unusual methyl group exhibit a resonance with a chemical shift less than 0 ppm? 
2.	 The 1H NMR resonances for the isopropyl groups are as follows: 1.11 ppm (doublet, 
12H), 1.45 ppm (doublet, 12H), and 2.69 ppm (septet, 4H).  Normally, the methyl groups 
in an isopropyl group are chemically equivalent, and so one only observes two 
resonances attributable to the isopropyl group.  Why, in this case, are there three distinct 
isopropyl resonances?  (I.e., why are all three carbons in each of the isopropyl groups 
chemically inequivalent from each other?) 
3.	 Represent the above molecule as LCuCH3, and pretend that NMR is your only tool of 
characterization.  Using 1H and 13C NMR, the above structure would be indistinguishable 
from the ion-paired structure [L2Cu]+[Cu(CH3)2] .  If 63Cu NMR were a viable method, 
-
how could you tell the difference between the ion-paired [L2Cu]+[Cu(CH3)2]  structure 
-
and the covalent LCuCH3 structure shown above?
