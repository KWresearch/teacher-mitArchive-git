13C NMR is useful for: 

1. 	 Determining  the number of chemically  non-equivalent  (or  “different  types of”) carbon 
atoms  in  a  mo lecu le,  based  on  the  number   o f   peaks   in  the  spectrum. 
(See 
substitution test, below.) 
Identifying  the  types of  functional  groups  in a molecule based on  the chemical  shift 
of  each  peak.  In  contrast  to  IR  spectroscopy,  the number of each  type  of  functional 
group (e.g. 2 chemically non-equivalent ketones) often can be determined.

1H NMR is useful for: 

1. 	 Determ in ing  the  number  of  chem ica l ly   non -equ iva len t   (or  “different  types  of”) 
hydrogen atoms  in a molecule, based on  the number of peaks  in  the spectrum.  Note: 
“number of peaks”  in  this case does not  include  the splitting pattern  (see below), e.g. a 
triplet is considered to be one “peak”. 
2. 	 Determining  the  relative  number  of  chemically  non-equivalent  hydrogen  atoms  by 
measuring  the  relative  area  of  each  peak  (by  integration  of  each  curve  –  not  by 
measuring the relative peak heights). 
Identifying neighboring  functional  groups based on the chemical  shift  of  each  peak, 
which is a measure of the chemical environment of each proton in the molecule. 
4.	 Determining  which  carbon  atoms  are  connected  to  which  based  on  the  sp l i t t ing  
pa t tern  or mu l t ip l ic i ty   of  each  peak.  This information is the most useful of all the 
methods we have discussed in determining the connectivity of the molecule, i.e. 
assembling all of the functional groups and fragments identified into an actual structure.

The substitution test is used to determine whether two atoms or 
groups are chemically non-equivalent: 

1. 	 Replace each atom or group in turn with “X”. 
If  these  two  structures are  identical  (can be  superimposed) or are  enantiomers, then 
2. 	
the  two  atoms  or  groups  are  chemically  equivalent  (homotop ic   and  enantiotopic, 
respectively) and thus are indistinguishable by NMR spectroscopy. 
If  the  two  structures  are  d i f fe ren t   (e.g.  d iastereomers  –  mak ing  the  two  groups 
diastereotopic, alkene  isomers, structural  isomers),  then  the  two atoms or groups are 
chemically non-equivalent and may be distinguishable by NMR spectroscopy.
