These mechanisms are fairly complicated.  In other words, if you can do these, you will be 
fine on the exam!  Working through these problems will help you to develop a good strategy 
for tackling simpler problems in a reasonable time frame.  It might help you to follow some of 
the following steps to get started.

 1. Number your carbons.  (Which carbon ends up where?)

 2. Make a list of the bonds that are broken and formed in the reaction.

 3. If you can't decide where to begin, start by working backwards.

 4. Look for familiar reactions, rearrangements, etc.
