Quinine:  A Popular Amine with a Rich History 
The Cinchona tree, found in rain forests on the eastern slopes of the Andes, has long been revered 
for  its  medicinal  properties.  Most  famously,  its  bitter  bark  is  effective  in  preventing  malaria.  Upon 
receiving  a  shipment  of  Cinchona  bark  from  South  America  in  1640,  the  British  military 
went  about  developing  a  Cinchona  tonic  to  protect  its  troops  from  the  deadly  disease 
while on missions in the tropics. 
The  problem?  The  active  component,  quinine,  is  barely  soluble  in  water  (~0.5 
g/L),  meaning  that  a  person  would  have  to  consume  close  to  two  liters  of  "tonic  water"
per  day  to  get  the  recommended  dose  of  quinine.   The  solution?   Quinine  is  extremely 
soluble  in  ethanol  (~1.2  kg/L).  The  British  soldiers  could  soak  the  Cinchona  bark  in  gin 
and  drink  just  a  few  ounces  of  the  concoction  three  times  a  day.  Lime  juice  was  used  to 
disguise the bitter flavor of the quinine, and a cultural phenomenom was born! 
The  modern  version  of  the  gin  and  tonic  uses  carbonated  tonic  water,  first
introduced  by  Schweppes  in  the  mid-1800's,  to  add  the  bitter  quinine  flavor.  But  don't 
think  that  downing  gin  and  tonics  will  protect  you  from  malaria  today.  Modern  tonic  water  contains 
roughly  20  mg  of  quinine  per  liter,  meaning  that  you  would  have  to  drink  50  liters  per  day  to  get  the 
necessary dosage!
