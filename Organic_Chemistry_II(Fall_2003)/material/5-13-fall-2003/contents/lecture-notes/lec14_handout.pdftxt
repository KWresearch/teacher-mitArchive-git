"(The 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry is given to Ernst Otto Fischer and 
Geoffrey Wilkinson) for their pioneering work on the chemistry of the 
organometallic, so calledsandwich compounds."

Cycloaddition:	A pericyclic reaction  in  which  2  sepa ra te   conjugated,  overlapping  arrays  of 
orbitals  comb ine .  Cycloadditions  proceed  by  way  of  a  cyclic  transition 
state, and 2 sigma bonds are formed during the course of the reaction. 

Asuprafacialprocess ("s" in the table below) is one in which the bonds made or broken lie on the 
same faceof the orbital array undergoing reaction. In anantarafacialprocess ("a"), the newly 
formed or broken bonds lie onopposite facesof the reacting orbital array.
