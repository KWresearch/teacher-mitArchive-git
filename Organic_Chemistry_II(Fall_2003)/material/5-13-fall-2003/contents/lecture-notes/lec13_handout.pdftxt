Cycloaddition Reactions â€“ The Diels-Alder Reaction 

Molecule of the Day 
cantharidin 

Cantharidin 
irritant 
Cantharis 
is  a  powerful 
isolated  from 
vesicatoria
, a.k.a. the "blistering beetle" or "Spanish fly", and is 
found in the eponymous, alleged aphrodisiac. Several chemistry 
research groups have prepared cantharidin by total synthesis, 
and in many of these aDiels-Alder reactionwas a key step.

Cycloaddition:	A pericyclic reaction  in  which  2  sepa ra te   conjugated,  overlapping  arrays  of 
orbitals  comb ine .  Cycloadditions  proceed  by  way  of  a  cyclic  transition 
state, and 2 sigma bonds are formed during the course of the reaction. 

Asuprafacialprocess ("s" in the table below) is one in which the bonds made or broken lie on the 
same faceof the orbital array undergoing reaction. In anantarafacialprocess ("a"), the newly 
formed or broken bonds lie onopposite facesof the reacting orbital array.
