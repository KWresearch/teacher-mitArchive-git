Organic Structure Determination:  Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) 

Molecules  of  the  Day 

Isoamyl acetate – banana 
Benzaldehyde  – almonds 
(R)–Limonene – lemon, lime 
1,4-Diaminobutane – a.k.a. putrescine 

Imagine  that  four  unlabelled  vials,  each 
containing one of our four "Molecules of the 
Day",  had  somehow  become mixed  up. 
How could IR spectroscopy (instead of your 
sense of smell) be employed to identify the 
contents of each vial?

Three-Stage  Strategy  for  Organic  Structure  Determination 

• Determine  the  molecular  formula  using elemental  analysis  and 
mass   spectrometry  

•  Identify  the  functional  groups using  infrared  spectroscopy  (IR) 
and  nuclear  magnetic  resonance spec t roscopy   (NMR). 

• Elucidate  the  connectivity using  1H NMR (“proton NMR”) and 13C 
NMR (“carbon NMR”) spectroscopy.
