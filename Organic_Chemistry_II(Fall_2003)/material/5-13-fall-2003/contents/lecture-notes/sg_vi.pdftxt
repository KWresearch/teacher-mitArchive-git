In 1993 and 1994, a family of marine-derived natural products were isolated from 
three  different  sea  sponges.  Several  of  these  natural  products,  including  spongistatin  2 
(altohyrtin  C),  exhibited  remarkable  anti-tumor  activity  when  tested  against  the 
National Cancer  Institute’s  panel  of  cancer  cell  lines.  The  spongistatins  are  believed  to 
s low   down   tumo r   g row th   by   inh ib i t ing   tubu l in
polymerization,  and  they  appear  to  bind  at  a  unique
site at the tubulin dimer. 
Because of  this noteworthy biological activity, 
there  is  a  great  deal  of  interest  in  probing  the  specific 
Me 
OH  mode  of  action  of  the  spongistatins.  The  problem? 
Very  little  of  the  active  compounds  can  be  isolated 
from  the  natural  sources.  In  addition,  although  five 
different research groups had successfully synthesized 
a member of  the spongistatin  family by 2002, none of 
these  syntheses generated more  than  four milligrams 
of the final product! 
To  overcome  this  problem,  Professor  Clayton 
Heathcock  at  the  University  of  California,  Berkeley 
set  out  to  develop  a  synthesis  that  could  generate 
multi-gram  quantities  of  spongistatin  2.  His  final 
synthesis,  published  in  September  2003  (J.  Am.  Chem.  Soc. 2003,  125, 12844–12849), 
required a total of 113 steps and generated 250 milligrams of the natural product.  While 
still  far  from  the  multi-gram  goal,  this  quantity  is  more  spongistatin  2  than  has  ever 
existed from the original isolation and all previous syntheses combined! 
What does this have to do with enols and enolates?  Professor Heathcock is one 
of  the  pioneers  of  enolate  chemistry,  and  he  used  enolates  to  form many carbon–carbon 
bonds  in  his  synthesis  of  spongistatin  2  (see  Figure  1).  This  is  not  unusual.  Enolate 
chemistry  is  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  modern  organic  synthesis,  and  over  the  next 
couple of weeks you will learn about some ways to harness the immense synthetic power 
of the carbonyl group–both as a nucleophile and an electrophile.
