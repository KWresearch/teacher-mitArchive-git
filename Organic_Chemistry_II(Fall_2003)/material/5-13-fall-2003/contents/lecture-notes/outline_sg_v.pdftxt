Penicillin: The Wonder Drug 
In the late 1800s, Louis Pasteur proposed the ground-breaking hypothesis that diseases 
were  caused  by  microorganisms.  This  theory  prompted  numerous 
scientists   to   begin   the   search   for   substances   that   could   kill   the  
microorganisms  causing  the  disease without  also  killing  the  patient. 
In the late 1920s, at St. Mary’s Hospital in London, Alexander Fleming 
found  that  his  bacterial  culture  plates  were  contaminated  with  an 
airborne  fungus.  More  importantly,  he  noticed  that  the  fungus 
inhibited  the  growth  of  bacteria  on  the  plate.  The  fungus  was 
Penicillium  notatum,  and  Fleming  named  the  extract  of  the  fungus 
penicillin. 
By  the  late  1930s,  enough  penicillin  had  been  extracted  to  perform  successful  clinical 
trials with humans, but British scientists were unable  to generate useful amounts of  the drug. 
With World War  II  raging  in Europe,  the  scientists  turned  to  the United States  for  assistance. 
The United States government declared  the production of penicillin a war project, and by  the 
end of the war, enough penicillin was being produced to treat seven million patients per year. 
Penicillin was successfully used to treat pneumonia, strep throat, scarlet fever, syphilis, 
gonorrhea, meningitis, and many other diseases.  The cooperative wartime project between the 
British and the Americans also  led to the proposed β-lactam structure for penicillin.  Research

an essential enzyme in the cell wall biosynthetic pathway.  This acylation opens the strained β-
lactam ring and renders the enzyme inactive (eq 1). 
Unfortunately, Fleming was correct  in his prediction  that bacteria would soon develop

Penicilloic  acid,  an  ineffective  acylating  agent 
unable  to  block  cell wall  synthesis  (eq  2).  By 
the  early  1950s,  nearly  60%  of  all  staph  infections were  penicillin-resistant.  As  a  result,  the 
vital search for newer and more effective antibiotics continues today. 
As a side note, the first total synthesis of natural penicillin (penicillin V) was completed 
in 1959 by Professor  John C. Sheehan at MIT.  In  the  course of his work, he developed one of 
the most widely used methods for forming amide bonds.  You can check out the details  in his 
paper :   “The   Tota l   Synthes is   of   Pen ic i l l in   V”   J.  Am.  Chem.  Soc.  1 9 5 9  ,  8 1,   3089–3094 .
