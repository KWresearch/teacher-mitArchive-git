Free  radicals  exist
naturally  in  our  bodies
and   p l a y  
imp o r t an t
roles  in  many  essential
biochemical  processes;
however,  research  has
shown  that an excess of
free  radicals  can  trigger
d e s t r u c t i v e  
c h a i n
reactions  in  cells.   Free

No  wonder  Americans
s p e n d   m i l l i o n s   o f
dollars  every  year  on  vitamins  containing  anti-oxidants!   It’s  even  hard  to  buy
face cream that doesn’t claim to fight free radicals.  From the old essentials like β-
carotene   and   vitamin   C ,   to   compounds   like   lycopene   and   EGCg   that   are
receiving  more  recent  attention,  it  appears  that  anti-oxidants  are  the  lucrative
weapons of choice in the endless battle against free radicals.
The same highly reactive species that wreak havoc on our bodies have been
tamed   and   harnessed   in   the   chem istry   laboratory .     Methods   have   been
developed  for  the  selective  formation of organic  radicals under mild  conditions,
and  a  great  deal  of  work  has  focused  on  understanding  and  predicting  the
reactivity of  free radicals once  they are  formed.  Organic radicals have proven  to
be  synthetically  useful  and  mechanistically  intriguing.   Over  the  next  few
lectures,  you  will  gain  some  insight  into  the  incredible  potential  of  free  radical
intermediates.
