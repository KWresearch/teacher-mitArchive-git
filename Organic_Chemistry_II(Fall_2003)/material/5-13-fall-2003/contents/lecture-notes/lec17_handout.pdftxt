Summary  of Unit  3 
Molecular Orbital Theory, Pericyclic Reactions 

A.	 Molecular Orbital Theory 
1.	 Ethylene 
2.	 Allyl cation, radical, anion 
3.	 1,3-Butadiene 
4.	 Benzene 
5.	 Cyclobutadiene – Frost’s Circle (Polygon Rule) 

B.	 Cycloaddition  Reactions 
1.	 Diels-Alder Reaction 
a.	 Basics – diene + dienophile (electron-poor) 
b.	 Only s-cis conformation of diene reacts. 
c.	 Cantharidin example 
d .  Stereochemical  course  –  part  1:  A lways  suprafacial  with  respect  to 
dienophile – stereospecific. 
e.	 Diels-Alder is a concerted reaction 
f.	 Frontier Molecular Orbital analysis of Diels-Alder  reaction.    HOMO  of  diene 
interacts with LUMO of dienophile.  “HOMO/LUMO analysis”. 
g.	 Stereochemical course  –  part  2:  Always  suprafacial  with  respect  to  diene. 
Disrotatory motion of orbitals. 
h.	 Woodward-Hoffman rules correctly predict  the  stereochemical  course  of  the 
Diels-Alder reaction (and all other cycloaddition reactions):  π4s + π2s. 
i.	 Regioselectivity –  “ortho-para  rule”.  Not  governed  by  W-H  rules,  but  a 
general trend. 
j.	 Diastereoselectivity – Alder endo rule. 
k.	 MO explanations: Coefficients of wavefunctions that  represent  orbitals  vary 
with  substitution.  Secondary  orbital  interactions  between  dienophile  and 
carbon(s) 2 and/or 3 of diene favor endo approach of dienophile. 
2.	 Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition 
a.	 Review of 4 requirements of cycloaddition (concerted, pericyclic; cyclic T.S.;  2 
separate arrays of orbitals; form 2 sigma bonds) and what W-H predicts for 
photo  [2+2]  (π2s + π2s) 
b .   Explanation  –  HOMO/LUMO  analysis.  	 Excite  electron  to  higher  energy 
orbital, which becomes HOMO. 
c.	 Examples:  cis-2-butene + maleic anhydride, thymidine dimmers 
3.	 Thermal [2+2] Cycloaddition – Ketenes + Alkenes 
a.	 MO analysis and W-H rules predict π2s + π2a 
b.	 Side-on approach of diene and ketene (“+” sign) 
4.	 Dipolar [4+2] Cycloaddition, Thermal 
a.	 Diene vs. Dipole – same # π electrons (4), different # atoms (4 vs. 3) 

b.	 Examples – azides, diazocompounds, nitrile oxides 
5.	 Ozonolysis – Most important dipolar cycloaddition 
a.	 Mechanism  –  [4+2],  retro-[4+2],  [4+2]. 
additional reagent 
b.	 Zn or (CH3)2S gives carbonyls in oxidation state as is (after hydrolysis) 
c.	 NaBH4 reduces aldehydes, ketones to alcohols 
d.	 H2C rO4 (Jones) oxidizes aldehyde to acid (no effect on ketone) 

(Then  reduction  or  oxidation  with 

C.	 Electrocyclic  Reactions 
1.	
Introductory Examples - (E,Z)-2,4-hexadiene and (E,E)-2,4-hexadiene 
2.	 Definitions 
a.	 Concerted pericyclic process

Intramolecular, i.e. 1 overlapping array of orbitals 
c.	
d.	 Formation/Breaking of 1 sigma bond 
3.	 FMO Analysis of Stereochemical Results (see examples in A, above) 
(Thermal) (E,Z)-2,4-hexadiene –> cis–3,4-dimethylcyclobutene 
a.	
(conrotatory) and (E,E)-2,4-hexadiene, thermal –> trans–3,4-
dimethylcyclobutene (conrotatory). 
b.	 (Photochemical) (E,Z)-2,4-hexadiene, –> trans–3,4-dimethylcyclobutene -
electron promoted to higher energy orbital; thus HOMO is different than in 
thermal reactions. (disrotatory) and (E,E)-2,4-hexadiene –> cis–3,4-
dimethylcyclobutene - electron promoted to higher energy orbital; thus 
HOMO is different than in thermal reactions. (disrotatory) 
4.	 Electrocyclic Ring Opening – W-H rules still apply 
a.	 trans–3,4-dimethylcyclobutene, thermal -> (E,E) -2,4-hexadiene 
(conrotatory) 
b.	 cis–3,4-dimethylcyclobutene, thermal -> (E,Z) -2,4-hexadiene 
(conrotatory) 
5.	 Electrocyclic Reactions Involving 6π Electrons 
(E,Z,E)-2,4,6-octatriene, thermal -> cis–5,6-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene 
a.	
(disrotatory) 
b.	 (E,Z,E)-2,4,6-octatriene, photochemical -> trans–5,6-dimethyl-1,3-
cyclohexadiene - electron promoted to higher energy orbital; thus HOMO is 
different than in thermal reactions. (conrotatory)

1.	 Definitions 
a.	 Concerted pericyclic process 
b.	 Cyclic transition state
