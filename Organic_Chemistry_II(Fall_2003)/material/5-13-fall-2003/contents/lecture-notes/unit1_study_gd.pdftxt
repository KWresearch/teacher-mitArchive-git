“…no single tool has had a more dramatic impact upon organic chemistry than infrared 
measurements.  The development, just after the second Great War, of sturdy and simply 
operated machines for the determination of infrared spectra has permitted a degree of 
immediate and continuous analytical and structural control in synthetic organic work which 
was literally unimaginable fifteen years ago…  Physical methods, and the principle that they 
should be used wherever possible, are now part of our armamentarium, and we may expect 
no surcease of further developments in this direction. 

“Nuclear magnetic resonance is even now on the horizon, and we shall be surprised if it 
does not permit another great step forward.” 
R. B. Woodward, 1956  (MIT SB  ’36, PhD  ’37; Nobel Prize  (Chemistry) 1965)

General Aims of this Unit: 

1.	

2.	

We will survey three types of spectroscopy and spectrometry:  Infrared (IR) 
spectroscopy, mass  spectrometry  (MS),  and nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR) 
spectroscopy  (1H and 13C).  For each method, we will discuss its physical basis, how 
characteristic data are affected by molecular structure, and the most useful applications 
of these data in structure elucidation. 

We will apply the above methods (and others) to the elucidation of organic molecular 
structures, using a three-stage strategy:  Determination of molecular formula, 
identification of functional groups, and elucidation of connectivity. 

(Nearly) Foolproof Protocol  for Organic Structure Determination 

A.	 Molecular Formula 
1.	 Determine molecular formula using elemental analysis (EA) and MS. 
2.	 Determine index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD = # rings + # π-bonds) from 
molecular formula. 
B.	 Functional Groups 
Identify functional groups using IR and 13C NMR (and 1H NMR occasionally) 
1.	
2.	 Determine symmetry (a.k.a. degeneracy) by comparing 13C NMR to molecular 
formula. 
C .	 Connect iv ity  
Identify molecular fragments using data from 1H  NMR: 
1.	
a.	 spin-spin splitting 
integration 
b.	
c.	 chemical shift 
d.	 …and MS fragmentation (can be done earlier in elucidation) 
2.	 Assemble fragments 
3.	 Confirm structural assignment – Must be consistent with ALL data.
