Absinthin is a natural product that is isolated from wormwood.  Extraordinarily bitter, 
it is the chief bitter component of absinthe, an intoxicating beverage that was quite 
popular in France in the late 19th century, especially in the artist community of that 
period, e.g. van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec. 

It is quite possible that the final step in the biosynthesis of absinthin involves a 
Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction of two identical cyclopentadiene-containing 
molecules, as shown in the reaction above.

"….in the synthesis of vitamin B-12 R. B. Woodward hit on  a  puzzle  whose  analysis  become  the 
point of departure  for  the discovery of  the  Woodward-Hoffmann  rules  concerning  the  role  of 
orbital symmetry in chemical reactions.  This development ushered in a new  era  in  the  theory  of 
organic chemistry, and it is particularly  fitting  that  it  was  the  protagonist  of  modern  natural 
product synthesis who triggered the final breakthrough of the  use  of  the  quantum  mechanical 
model  of  structure  and  reactivity  in  organic  chemistry,  an  advance  that  parallels  the 
establishment of the  classical  structural  theory,  the  tetrahedral  model  of  carbon,  the  octet  rule, 
and conformational analysis."

General Aims of this Unit:

We will learn to recognize pericyclic reactions and to classify them as being 
electrocyclic processes, cycloadditions, or sigmatropic  rearrangements. 

We will develop a general understanding of the theoretical basis of the Woodward-
Hoffmann Rules based on the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory of Fukui. 

We will learn how to apply the Woodward-Hoffmann Rules to predict the stereochemical 
outcome of pericyclic reactions. 

We will study several pericyclic reactions in detail, learning how to predict the products of 
these reactions and how to employ them in synthesis.  Specifically, we will focus our attention 
on the Diels-Alder reaction, the Cope rearrangement, the Claisen rearrangement, and 
ketene [2+2] cycloadditions.
