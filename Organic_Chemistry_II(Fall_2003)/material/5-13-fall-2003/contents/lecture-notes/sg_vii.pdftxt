Outline & Study Guide for Unit VII. Carbocations 

“Every generation of scientific men (i.e. scientists) starts where the previous 
generation left off; and the most advanced discoveries of one age constitute 
elementary axioms of the next.” 
–Aldous Huxley 

Professor George A. Olah of The University of Southern California began 
his Nobel lecture with this quote when he was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry for “his contribution to carbocation chemistry.” 
Carbocationic species are intermediates in many chemical 
reac t ions   carr ied   ou t   in   the   labora tory ,   as   we l l   as  
numerous reactions that take place in nature. 
One  famous  example  of  a  carbocationic  cascade 
reaction  is  the  biosynthesis  of  cholesterol  from  squalene 
oxide.  Conversion  of  the  linear  polyene  to  the  four-ring 
steroid  nucleus  happens  through  a  series  of  carbocation 
rearrangements.  Elucidation of this extraordinary biosynthetic pathway, one of 
the most  complex known, was  accomplished by Konrad Bloch, Feodor Lynen, 
John Cornforth, and George Popjak  in  the  late 1950s.  In  fact, Bloch and Lynen 
were  awarded  the  1994 Nobel Prize  in Physiology or Medicine  for  their work. 
In  the  course  of  the next  few  lectures, you will  learn how you  can harness  the 
power of the carbocation in a number of useful synthetic transformations.
