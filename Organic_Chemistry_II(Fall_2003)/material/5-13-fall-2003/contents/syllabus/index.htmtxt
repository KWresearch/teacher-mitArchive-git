***** Overview *****
This intermediate organic chemistry course focuses on the methods used to
identify the structure of organic molecules, advanced principles of organic
stereochemistry, organic reaction mechanisms, and methods used for the
synthesis of organic compounds. Topics include spectroscopy, spectrometry, and
structure elucidation with an emphasis on the application of infrared and
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Additional specific topics include:
    * Molecular Orbital Theory and Pericyclic Reactions: Modern concepts of
      bonding and aromaticity. The Woodward-Hoffmann Rules. Mechanism of
      pericyclic reactions and applications in synthesis.
    * Chemistry of Functional Groups: Ethers, Epoxides, Amines, and Carboxylic
      Acids. Enols, Enolates.
    * Chemistry of Reactive Intermediates: Carbocations, Radicals.
***** Texts *****
[Amazon_logo] Wade, L. G. Organic Chemistry. 5th ed. New Jersey: Prentice Hall/
Pearson Education, 2002. ISBN: 9780130338327.
***** Molecular Models *****
Several units in 5.13 will emphasize many stereochemical aspects of organic
reactions and molecules. To help you visualize stereochemical concepts, we
recommend that you purchase theÂ DarlingÂ Molecular_VisionsTM Molecular Model
Kit. Note that you will be permitted to bring model sets to the hour exams and
the final.
***** Problem Sets *****
Problem sets are mandatory and will be corrected by the TAs. Approximately
eight problem sets will be assigned and should be handed in to your recitation
instructor on the dates announced. Written solutions will become available for
each problem set. In addition, approximately every week we will assign sets of
"drill problems" to be done in conjunction with the weekly reading assignments.
Some drill problems will be discussed in recitation section.
***** Exams *****
There will be four exams in addition to the final. These exams will be held
during the class lecture time. Review sessions will be scheduled prior to each
exam. Please notify course instructors and the Chemistry Education Office of
any conflicts or concerns regarding taking exams at the scheduled time.
Conflict exams generally will be scheduled for the same day as the regular
exam.
***** Grading *****
***** Final course grades will be based on the following table. *****
ACTIVITIES      PERCENTAGES
Final Exam      33%
Four hour Exams 67%
Recitation attendance and problem set performance will be used to determine
grades for the broad group of students whose exam scores place them at the A/B,
B/C, and C/D borders.
