Fall 2005 10.34 Exam II. Wed. Nov. 9, 2005


(SOLUTION) 

Read through the entire exam before beginning work, and budget your time. 

You are researching drug eluting stents, and wish to understand better how the drug 
release rate depends upon the properties of the fluid in which it is immersed. You develop 
a model using the simplified geometry shown in the figure below. 

The stent is placed on a solid impermeable surface, and to simply the flow problem, we 
assume that the drug stent is very thin and does not affect the local nature of the flow. 
Also, we assume that the stent is very wide in the out-of-plane direction so that we can 
neglect variation in the z direction. The local velocity of the fluid goes from zero at the 
solid surface (no-slip BC) to the superficial velocity V at a distance
 from the surface. 
We assume a linear velocity profile,

NOTE: 

This problem was inspired by an actual numerical study performed by a student 
here at MIT. In that case, she was looking at the spatial distribution of drug release 
into the underlying tissue by solving a reaction/diffusion equation in the underlying 
surface underneath the stent to model drug uptake. She also solved, coupled to 
the convection/diffusion equation in the fluid stream, the Navier-Stokes equations 
to compute the exact laminar velocity profile around the stent. In practice, the drug 
release into the underlying tissue is not spatially uniform, but is concentrated just 
below and downstream of the stent. Here, I have simplified the problem by making 
the underlying surface impermeable to the drug and by neglecting any perturba­
tion in the flow field by the stent. 

You wish to compute the steady state concentration profile c x, y )  using finite differences. 
(
You wish your solution to approximate the case of an isolated stent on an infinitely large 
solid surface in contact with an infinitely large body of fluid, with specified values of the 
superficial velocity V, boundary layer thickness  δ
b  , drug equilibrium concentration  c eq , 
stent size L, and drug diffusivity D. 

(1.a) (5 pts) Describe how would you choose the remaining parameter values in a set of 
one or more finite difference calculations to approximate the solution in this limiting case. 

ANSWER: 

To simulate a single stent on an infintely large surface we want xL 
 and  xR 
. 
To simulate contact with an infinitely large body of fluid, we want B →
. But, for our 
finite difference calculations, all of these values must be finite. So, we start with 
moderately large values of these distances, and increase them until they no 
longer seem to affect the local behavior of the solution near the stent.

(1.b) (5 pts) How would you determine a sufficient number of grid points to use in your 
calculations? 

ANSWER: 

 B , in the limit where the grid point 
,
,
We only obtain the exact solution, for fixed  xL
xR 
spacing goes to zero. But again, in practice we can only treat a finite number N or 
x 
grid points in the x direction and a finite number Ny  in the y direction. Again, we 
must increase these until the local solution near the stent no longer appears to 
change significantly with an increase in the number of grid points. 

Also, as an optional additional factor that might influence our decision, we see that 
this is a convection/diffusion problem, and so we should use upwind differencing 
to avoid the unphysical oscillations that occur when the grid point spacing is too 
large. But, these differences are less accurate than central differences. So, we 
might want to choose N  large enough that the local Peclet number V ( ∆ x ) ⁄ L  is less 
x 
than two, so that we could safely use the more accurate central finite difference 
approximation.

DO NOT ASSUME UNIFORM GRID SPACING, as it is probably much more efficient to 
use a narrower grid point spacing near the stent than far away from it. Assume that you

However, we could (optionally) use the more-accurate central finite diference

Finally, we will have to account for the fact that at each of the four corners, we 
have to make two of the modifications above. This completes the derivation of the 
set of linear algebraic equations that we solve to obtain the steady-state concen­
trations at each grid point. 

(2.b) (5 pts) What numerical issues were you considering when you chose the particular 
finite difference approximations that you used? 

ANSWER: 

When discretizing the first derivative in the convection term, upwind one-sided dif­
ferences were used to avoid any spurious oscillations. When discretizing the first 
derivative in the boundary conditions, Langrange interpolation was used to pro­
vide just as high accuracy as is used when discretizing the second derivatives. 

Once you have derived these equations, you must solve then in MATLAB. 

(3.a) (5 pts) Explain how you would do this, and describe your procedure for putting the 
problem into a standardized format that one of the MATLAB solvers knows how to handle.

Gaussian elimination is much faster, with the computational time scaling as  Nm 2 , 
where  N  is the number of unknowns and  m  is the bandwidth. Here, N  =  N xN y  and

Let us say that you have now computed the steady state concentration field  c x, y ) using 
(
the method outlined above. 

(4) (15 pts) Explain in detail how you would compute from your numerical solution the net 
flux of drug out of the stent, in units of moles of drug per unit width in the z direction per 
unit time. “In detail” means set up th e exact equation(s) that you would solve to obtain this 
value, and describe what MATLAB routine(s) you would use.

The diffusive flux of drug out of the stent surface is  – D ∂

Using the same Lagrangian interpolation method as for the von Neumann BC at 
the solid surface, we can estimate the value of the derivative at each grid point
0 ≤
L  on the stent surface. We then obtain the net flux by integrating over these 
x j 
values with trapz. 

Let’s say that we now want to  simulate a dynamic release, where initially the fluid con­
tains no drug and then at time zero, the release from the drug begins until steady state is 
reached. Assume that you will have to do this calculation several times for different 
parameter values, and so computational time is a concern. 

(5.a) (5 pts) What MATLAB routine would you use to perform the calculation, and why do 
you choose this particular one? 

ANSWER: 

I would use ode15s, as sets of coupled ODEs obtained by discretizing PDEs such 
as this one are quite stiff for any moderately large number of grid points. 

To use this MATLAB routine, you have to supply additional routine(s) as well to provide 
information about the dynamics of your specific system. 

(5.b) (10 pts) What information will you provide, and how do you obtain it from the deri­
vations you performed for your steady-state calculation above? 

ANSWER: 

I would have to supply the time derivative vector,  f t, ϕ ) =  A ϕ
(
–  b , where  A  and b  are 
the same quantities derived above. Also, as ode15s is implicit, I should supply the 
Jacobian matrix to avoid ode15s having to estimate it by costly finite difference 
approximations. Luckily, I already have the Jacobian matrix, which is just  A .

Here we have neglected variation in the out-of-plane z direction by assuming infinite 
width of the stent in that direction. 

(6) (10 pts) If we wanted to relax this approximation and model a stent of finite length and 
width, what new numerical issues would arise in computing the steady state solution? 

ANSWER: 

By relaxing this approximation, we have a 3-D boundary value problem. There is 
nothing conceptually new about how we discretize the diffusion equation or 
enforce the boundary conditions. What would change is the method used to solve 
the set of linear algebraic equations, since Gaussian elimination cannot be used 
with 3-D systems due to extreme fill-in problems. Therefore, I would have to use 
an iterative solver that does not have this problem, along the lines of the methods 
described in class (e.g. gmres). 

(7) (5 pts) Your @#$% professor has just given you another exam that is far too long to 
complete in just 55 minutes. Scanning the test, you see that there are  N  problems, where 
each problem j  = 1 2  …
  , N  is worth  P j  points. You estimate that problem j would take  T j

minutes to finish completely, and you are confident you would get the right answer if you 

had enough time. Due to partial credit, you feel the score that you would receive on each 

question is proportional to the time allotted to it, so that if you spend  1--- T j  minutes on prob­
2 
lem j, you receive  1--- P j  points. Express the problem of finding the best time-management
2 
strategy in terms of a constrained minimization that you can solve numerically. 

ANSWER: 

I want to set up this problem as a minimization of a cost function subject to some 
number of equality or inequality constraints. The set of variables that we vary are 
the times  { t1
,
,
  , tN 
} allocated to each problem. We want to maximize the score,
t 2 
so with the effect of partial credit, we minimize the cost function

This type of resource allocation problem is common in industry, often with the use 
of linear cost and constraint functions such as found here. In this instance, it is 
easy to see that the optimal strategy is to work through the problems in order of 
⁄  T j ; however, the general linear pro­
their decreasing rate of point generation,  P j 
gramming approach outlined here is far more general and can be applied to many 
problems where the optimal strategy is not so evident.
