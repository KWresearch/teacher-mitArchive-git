Fall 2005 10.34 Exam I. Friday Oct. 7, 2005.


Read through the entire exam before beginning work, and budget your time. 

Perform all calculations by hand, showing all steps.  You may use a calcula­
tion for simple multiplication and addition of numbers, however.

(b) Compute the LU decomposition  A  =  LU  where  L  is a lower-triangular matrix and  U  is 
an upper-triangular matrix. 

Answer 

To generate A  =  LU  we perform Gaussian elimination without partial pivoting. First, 
we zero the (2,1) component, calculating

(c) Compute the determinant of  A . 

Answer 

Here, we save some time by noting that  A  =  LU  =  L  U  , and remembering that 
the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements. 
Therefore,  L  = 1  and 

A  =  U

We can compute the solution quickly by using the LU factorization. Substituting for

Problem 3. Consider again the matrix  A  of problem 1. 

(a) What properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of  A  can you infer simply by 
inspection of  A , i.e. with no additional computations? 

Answer 

Since  A  is real-symmetric, we know that its eigenvalues are all real and its eigen­
vectors are mutually orthogonal. 

(b) Compute an upper bound on the largest possible magnitude (modulus) of an eigen­
value of  A .  That is, find a value  λ
max  such that for all eigenvalues
 of  A , we are guaran-
teed to have 
.

Answer 

Here, we use Gershorgin’s theorem and the fact that we know all eigenvalues of  A 
to be real. Gershorgin’s theorem states that for each  λ
, such that  Aw =  λ w , one of 
the following inequalities must apply,

Thus, we have  0 ≤

less than or equal to 5.  5 is thus an upper bound on the magnitude of the eigen­
values of  A . In fact, the eigenvalues are 0.2679, 3.0000, 3.7321.
