10.34. Numerical Methods Applied to Chemical Engineering 
Fall 2005. Homework # 9 
Due : Friday, December 9, 2005.  9am 

For brevity, this homework focuses on problems involving fitting a model to a single set 
of data in Table 8.4, containing heat-transfer data for a packed bed of solid pellets.  We 
fit a nonlinear model for the Nusselt number as a function of the Reynoldsâ€™ and Prandtl 
numbers, and consider a transformed version of the model in which the dependence upon 
the parameters is linear. 

Problem 1. In 8.A.1 you are asked to compute the least-squares estimates of the 
parameters and their confidence intervals by hand using the formulae in the text. 

Problem 2. In 8.A.2, you are asked to redo the calculation using the built-in regress 
routine of the MATLAB statistics toolkit. 

Problem 3. In 8.A.3, you are asked to fit the original nonlinear model without the 
transformation using nlinfit. 

For each problem k = 1, 2, 3, supply your code as the MATLAB program 
username_P8Ak.m.
