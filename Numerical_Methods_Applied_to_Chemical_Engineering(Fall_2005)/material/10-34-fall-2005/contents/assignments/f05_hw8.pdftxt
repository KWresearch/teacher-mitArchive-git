Problem 1. Brownian motion in an external field 

Consider the Brownian motion in the x-direction of a spherical particle of radius  R p  and 
p  moving in a Newtonian fluid of viscosity  µ
density  ρ
f . Stokes’ law gives a drag constant 
of  ζ  = 6 πµ
f Rp  . The particle experiences an external potential energy field  U x( )  such that 
the force imparted to the particle by the field is  – ( dU x ) . Let us say that the fluid itself is
⁄  d 
moving in the x-direction with a velocity  V f  . With a random force FR  t( )  due to collisions 
with individual fluid molecules, Newton ’s  second law of motion for the particle is

As shown in class, the mass of a particle,  m  =  --- π
pR 3 , becomes negligibly small compared
p

6 πµ
to the drag constant ζ  = 
when R  is very small. This results in extremely short
f R p

=  m  ⁄
velocity correlation times  τ
ζ  . If we are concerned only with the observed motion of
v 
the particle on times scales long compared to  τ
, we can neglect the inertial effects com­
v 
pletely by taking the limit  m  →  0  while holding  ζ  constant. In this limit, the motion of the 
particle follows 

0 = – ζ (

v – V f
x 

)  – 

dU 
+ FR  t( )

Upon rearrangement, and multiplying by  d t  , using  d x   =  v d t  , this yields

(EQ 3) 

As we have shown in class, in the case where  V f  =  0 ,  U x( )  =  0 , we get the correct statistical 
properties of the random displacement by simulating the SDE (Stochastic Differential 
Equation) 

d x  =  ( 2D ) 1 2dW t 

For a finite time step  ∆

t , we have the simulation algorithm

∆ W t  is a random number generated at each time step with

∆ W t  is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of  σ 2 =  ∆

Therefore, to agree with this limiting case, we write the SDE for the particle motion in a 
moving fluid and an external field as 

d x  =

Part 1.A. 

deterministic velocity of the particle equal to  vp  =  V f  – 

Considering the SDE above, we see that if we had no random force, we would have a 
1–  dU 
. So, the deterministic (non­
xd 
x t( )  
random) part of the SDE appears to describe convective motion, and the random part (as 
we have seen) describes diffusive motion. This appears to suggest that the probability dis­
tribution  p t  x )  follows a convection/diffusion equation

Here, you are asked to perform a number of Brownian dynamics simulations to demon­
strate that the probability distribution does indeed follow this convection/diffusion equa-

domain  0 ≤

bring it back inside the domain. Since the potential energy is also periodic, this shifting 
has no deleterious effect on the simulation, and it enables us to compare the measured

In your Brownian dynamics simulation, you should not start sampling the distribution of x 
until you have run the simulation for a while to “equilibrate ” the system. Simulate the 
motion of a particle at  T =  1 ,  E =  1 , D =  1  and demonstrate that the Brownian dynamics

simulation samples properly from the equilibrium distribution. That is, the probability dis­
tribution measured from the trajectory  x t( ) agrees with the Boltzmann distribution. Store

Consider again the same external potential, but now do not use the periodic boundary con­

a 
we expect the barriers to be difficult to overcome such that the particle trajectories become 
“trapped” between ba
rriers for a long time until they are finally able to “jump” to the next 
energy well. If we then continue the simulation over very long periods of time such that 
each trajectory has experienced many jumps, and we measure at various times the mean 
2 x ( ) , we can estimate the effective diffusivity,

Clearly, the cost function has many local minima, and it would be very difficult to find the 
global minimum using the deterministic techniques that we developed in chapter 5. Unfor­
tunately, such irregular cost functions are not uncommon, especially when attempting to 
compute the minimum energy geometry of a molecule or a crystal. 

Write a program that uses simulated annealing to identify the global minimum from a ran­
dom initial guess. Store your program as username_HW8_P3.m and provide directions 
for its use.
