Again, you are to submit your work electronically to the MIT server.  Submit a MS-Word 
document username_HW2.doc with a description of your work.  The names to use 
individual programs are found in the problem statements below.  All problems are from 
chapter 1 of the text. 
 
1. Solve problem 1.A.3, with your routine taking the name 
username_calc_poly_coeff.m.  Test and show the results of your program by fitting 
f(x) = exp(x) at the points x = 1, 1.5, and 2.  What happens to the accuracy of your 
approximation as you move outside of the range [1, 2]?  In chapter 4, we will see how to 
do polynomial approximation much more efficiently. 
 
2. Solve problem 1.A.4 and name your routine username_Gram_Schmidt.m.  
Demonstrate its use for the vector v = [1.3; 2.1; -0.9] and show that your generated set of 
basis vectors is indeed orthogonal. 
 
3. Solve problem 1.B.2 to use linear regression to estimate the Michaelis-Menten rate 
constants of the enzymatic reaction from the data of Table 1.2.  The tables are found in 
the back of the text.  Write your routine as username_P1B2.m.  Make a plot comparing 
the data of Table 1.2 with the predictions of your fitted model. 
 
4. Solve problem 1.B.3 using finite differences to obtain a set of sparse linear algebraic 
equations.  Write your routine as username_P1B3.m.  While I ask for you to put the 
problem in dimensionless form, this is for now not strictly necessary.  I am sure that by 
the end of 10.50, putting problems in dimensionless form will seem like second nature.  
Show your numerical solution for DA = 1, k = 1, B = 2, HApA = 1 and then redo the 
calculation for DA = 0.1 and 0.01.  What happens to the concentration profile as the 
diffusivity is reduced?  You should for each calculation increase the number of grid 
points until you obtain sufficient accuracy (for example, no longer see any significant 
change in the solution when you vary the number of grid points).
