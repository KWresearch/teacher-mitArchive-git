1.3.1 Interpreting Ax = b as a linear transformation 
 
In Gaussian elimination, we have found a method that returns, if all pivot elements are 
non-zero, a solution vector x ∈  RN to the linear system 
 

Ax = b          (1.3.1-1) 
 
 Where b ∈ RN and A is a N x N real matrix. 
 
If we find a solution, how do we know if it is the only one?  If we find a zero maximum 
pivot element, Gaussian elimination fails.  How do we know if there is really no solution? 
 
These are crucial questions if we intend linear systems to be the foundation upon which 
we build our other algorithms. 
 
To answer these questions, we will look at the problem of solving A x = b in a more 
abstract language. 
 
By RN we mean the space of all real N-dimensional vectors. 
What do we mean by “space”?

First, we know that we can “collect” all possible vectors

all real scalars, to form the set of all N-dimensional vectors.     (1.3.1-2) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

v

 where v1, …, vN are 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

c(v + u) = cv + cu 
(c1 + c2)v = c1v + c2v    (1.3.1-5) 
(c1c2)v = c1(c2v) 
1v = v 

By the term “space”, we make explicit not that the collection of all possible vectors that 
are real and N-dimensional, RN, have the following special properties: 
 
> if v∈ RN and w∈ RN then v + w ∈ RN (closure under addition)     (1.3.1-3) 
 
>if v∈ RN and c is a real scalar, c v∈ RN (closure under multiplication by a scalar)  
(1.3.1-4) 
 
>for any u, v, w, ∈ RN, and for any real scalars c1, c2, we have 
 
u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w 
u + v  = v + u   
 
v + 0 = v 
 
 
v + (-v) = 0  
 
 
 
Since these properties hold, we call RN a vector space.  In our later discussion of 
functional analysis, we will see that such a concept of a vector space provides a useful, 
general viewpoint for looking at other problems. 
 
 
We are concerned now with real vectors, but we note that by merely relaxing the 
definitions in (1.3.1-3), (1.3.1-4), (1.3.1-5) to include all complex scalars and complex N-
dimensional vectors, we have the space of all complex N-dimensional vectors CN. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

From this concept of the space of all possible real N-dimensional vectors RN, we obtain 
the following interpretation of the real N x N matrix A: 
 
For any vector v ∈ RN, the real N x N matrix A generates a new vector A v ∈ RN 
according to the rule

     (1.3.1-6) 

 
Any such rule that assigns to any element of a set, a particular element of another set is 
called a map.  Here, we have a special kind of map, called a linear transformation, since 
we map a space into another according to a rule that satisfies linear conditions 
 

A(v + w) = Av + Aw 
A(cv) = cAv 
(1.3.1-7) 
 

For any vector v, w, ∈ RN and any scalar c. 
 
We can “draw” the operation of A using the following diagram: 
 
 
 
          RN                                                                                                               RN 
           v                                 A                                                     Av 
 
         w                                                A                                   w 
 
 
   domain of A                    N x N real matrix A                     codomain of A 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

This interpretation of A as a linear transformation provides the framework in which we 
can examine questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions to Ax = b. 
 
We interpret the process of solving Ax = b in the following manner. 
 
Given the linear transformation A that maps v ∈ RN to a vector A v ∈ RN; how do we find 
the vector (or vectors) x ∈ RN, such that A maps x into a particular vector b, i.e. Ax = b. 
 
 
          RN                                                                                                               RN 
           x                                 A                                                     b 
 
         v                                                                                    Av 
 
 
    
Given b, how do we find x that maps into it? 
 
This conceptual point of view will be of great assistance in understanding when there is 
or is not a unique solution.
