% function [grid_z,iflag] = set_grid_1D(num_pts,length);

%

% This procedure sets the grid point locations for a 1-D 

% finite difference discretization. For the first version 

% of this program, the grid points will be spaced at  

% uniform intervals in the domain 0 to reactor_len.

%

% INPUT : 

% =======

% num_pts 
INT

the number of points in the grid

% 
% length 
INT

the grid points are to be placed

% 
% 
from z=0 to z=length
