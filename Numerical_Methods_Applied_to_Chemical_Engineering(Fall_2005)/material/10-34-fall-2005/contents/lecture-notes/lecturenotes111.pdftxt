EXPRESSING SYSTEMS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AS: A x = b  

 
 
 
 
We wish to solve systems of simultaneous linear algebraic equations of the general form: 
 
  a11x1 + a12x2 + … + a1nxn = b1 
  a21x1 + a22x2 + … + a2nxn = b2 
:
:                            
: 
:
                            an1x1 +an2x2 + … + annxn = bn          (1.1.1-1) 
 
 

 
Where we have N equations for the N unknowns x1, x2, …, xn. 
 
 
 
As a particular example, consider the following set of these three equations (N=3) for the 
three unknowns x1, x2, x3: 
 

x1 + x2 + x3 = 4 
 
2x1 + x2 + 3x3 = 7 
 
                      3x1 + x2 +6x3 = 2          (1.1.1-2) 
 
aij = constant coefficient (usually real) multiplying unknown xj in equation #i. 
Bi = constant “right-hand-side” coefficient for equation #i. 
 
 
 
For the system (1.1.1-2) above, 
 

a11 = 1            a12 = 1            a13 = 1            b1 = 4 
a21 = 2            a22 = 1            a23 = 3            b2 = 7 
a31 = 3            a32 = 1            a33 = 6            b3 = 2

It is common to write linear systems in matrix/vector for as: 
 

A x = b             (1.1.1-3) 
 
Where the vector of unknowns  x  is written as: 
 

x  = 

            (1.1.1-4) 

 
The vector of right-hand-side coefficients  b  is written: 
 

 

b  = 

            (1.1.1-5)

We see that row ‘i’ contains the values ai1, ai2, …, aiN that are the coefficients 
multiplying each unknown x1, x2, …, xN in equation #i.

For the example system (1.1.1-2): 
 

x1 + x2 + x3 = 4 
 
2x1 + x2 + 3x3 = 7 

                                              3x1 + x2 +6x3 = 2            (1.1.1-2, repeated) 

A = 

 

     

b  =

As we will represent our linear systems as matrices “acting on” vectors, some review 
of basic vector notation is required.
