1.3.5 The Determinant Of A Square Matrix 
 
In section 1.3.4 we have seen that the condition of existence and uniqueness for solutions 
to A x = b involves whether KA = 0, i.e. only w = 0 has the property that Aw = 0. 
 
To use this result, we need a method by which we can examine the elements of A to 
determine if KA = 0. 
 
For N = 1, this is simple.  For the single equation 
 
Ax = b     (1.3.5-1) 
 
b .  If a = 0, then if b = 0, there exists an 
If a 0, we have a single (unique) solution x = 
≠
a
infinite number of solutions.  If b ≠ 0, there is no solution. 
 
For N > 1, we want a similar rule.  Given an N x N real matrix A, we want a rule to 
calculate a scalar called the determinant, det(A), such that 
 

     (1.3.5-2)

 b

=



 then



 
Since this determinant is to be used to determine whether a system Ax = b will have a 
unique solution, we can identify some characteristics that a suitable functional form of 
det(A) must possess.

Characteristic #1: 
 
If we multiply any equation in our system, say the jth aj1x1 + aj2x2 + … + ajNxN = bj    
(1.3.5-3) by a scalar c 0, we obtain an equation 
≠
 
caj1x1 + caj2x2 + … + cajNxN = cbj     (1.3.5-4) 
As this new equation is completely equivalent to the first one, the determinants of the 
following 2 matrices should either both be zero or both be non-zero. 
 








 
Moreover, if c = 0, then even if det(A)  ≠ 0, the determinant of the 2nd matrix in (1.3.5-5) 
should be zero. 
 
We note that we can satisfy these requirements if our determinant function has the 
property that the determinant of the 2nd matrix is c * det(A). 
 
 
Characteristic #2. 
 
The existence of a solution to Ax = b does not depend upon the order in which we write 
the equations.  Therefore, we must be able to exchange any 2 rows in a matrix without 
affecting whether the determinant is zero or non-zero. 
 
One way to satisfy this is if A’ is the matrix obtained from A by interchanging any 2 
rows, then our determinant should satisfy det(A’) =  ± det(A).    (1.3.5-6) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Characteristic #3: 
 
We can write the following 3 equations 
 
x + y + z = 4 
2x + y + 3z = 7 
3x + y + 6z = 2     (1.3.5-7) 
 
in matrix form with the labels 
 
x1 = x     x2 = y     x3 = z     (1.3.5-8) 
 
to yield the matrix 
 

A =

We could just as well label the unknowns by 
 
x1 = x     x2 = z     x3 = y     (1.3.5-9) 
 
In which case we obtain a matrix 
 

A’ = 

     (1.3.5-10)

Obviously, such an interchange of columns does nothing to affect the existence and 
uniqueness of solutions.  Therefore either det(A) and det(A’) are both zero, or det(A) and 
det(A’) are both non-zero. 
 
One way to satisfy this is to make det(A’) =  ± det(A).         (1.3.5-11) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Characteristic #4: 
 
We can select any 2 equations, say # i and #j, 
 
ai1x1 + ai2x2 + … + aiNxN = bi 
aj1x1 + aj2x2+ … + ajNxN = bj     (1.3.5-11) 
 
and replace them by the following 2, with c ≠ 0 
 
 
ai1x1 + ai2x2 + … + aiNxN = bi 
(cai1 + aj1)x1 + (cai2 + aj2)x2 + … + (caiN + ajN)xN = (cbi + bj)     (1.3.5-12) 
 
If A is the original matrix of the system, and A’ is the new matrix obtained after making 
this replacement, than either det(A) and det(A’) are both zero or they are both non-zero. 
 
Characteristic #5: 
 
If C = AB, the viewing Cx = b as 
 
 
RN 
 
 
 
 
 
x                           
 
 
 
 
 
We see that det(C) 
det(B) 
 0. 
≠
 
One way to ensure this is if det(C) = det(A) x det(B)     (1.3.5-13) 
 
Characteristic #6: 
 
If any 2 rows of A are identical, the equations that they represent are dependent.  We 
therefore do not have a unique solution, and must have det(A) = 0. 
 
Similarly if all elements of a given row are zero, we have the equation 0 = bj, which is 
inconsistent if bj ≠ 0.  Therefore, we must have det(A) = 0. 
 
 
 
 
 

RN 
 
 
 
 
A

B 
 

 0 if and only if both det(A) 

≠ 0 (so a unique Bx exists) and if 

RN 

C 

 
 
 

 

b 

 

 

 

≠

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Characteristic #7: 
 
If any 2 rows of A are equal, say columns #i and #j, then for all M∈ [1,N] aMi = aMj.  We 
can therefore write each equation as 
 
aM1x1 + aM2x2 + … + aMixi + … + aMjxj + … + aMNxN 
= aM1x1 + aM2x2 + … + aMi(xi + xj) + … + aMNxN     (1.3.5-14) 
 
Since xi and xj only appear together in this system of equations as the sum xi + xj, we 
could make the following change for any c that would not affect Ax, 
 
xi (cid:197) xi + c       xj (cid:197) xj – c     (1.3.5-15) 
 
Therefore, we must have det(A) = 0. 
 
Similarly, if any column of A contains all zeros, det(A) = 0. 
 
 
 
 
 
We now have identified a number of properties that any functional form for det(A) must 
have to be a proper measure of existence and uniqueness for Ax = b. 
 
We now propose a functional form for the determinant, and show that it does satisfy these 
characteristics.

By “even parity permutation” we mean the following.  Since  E
 = 0 if any two of the

set { i
i
...,
i,
}, we know that the ordered set ( i

i,
), if 
i
...i
2
1
N
2
1
N
21
N
must be related to the ordered set (1, 2, 3, …, N) by some shuffling of the order. 
 
For example, consider i1 = 3, i2 = 2, i3 = 4, i = 1, so 
(i1, i2, i3, i4) = (3, 2, 4, 1)       (1.3.5-18) 
 
We want to perform a sequence of interchanges to put it in the order (1, 2, 3, 4). 
 
Interchange #1,     (3, 2, 4, 1) (cid:198)    (3, 2, 1, 4)      (1.3.5-19) 
 
 
 
Interchange #2,     (3, 2, 1, 4)  (cid:198)    (3, 1, 2, 4) 
 
 
 
 
 
Interchange #3,     (3, 1, 2, 4)  (cid:198)   (1, 3, 2, 4) 
 
 
 
 
Interchange #4,    (1, 3, 2, 4)   (cid:198)  (1, 2, 3, 4)     (1.3.4-19) 
 
 
 
 
 
So we have put (3, 2, 4, 1) into order (1, 2, 3, 4)  with four interchanges. 
 
 

Note that we could do the same thing with only 2 interchanges: 
 
(3, 2, 4, 1) (cid:198) (1, 2, 4, 3) (cid:198) (1, 2, 3, 4)     (1.3.5-20) 
 
or less efficiently, with six 
 
(3, 2, 4, 1) (cid:198) (4, 2, 3, 1)  (cid:198) (2, 4, 3, 1)  (cid:198)  ( 1, 4, 3, 2)  (cid:198)  (1, 4, 2, 3)  (cid:198)  (1, 4, 3, 2)  (cid:198) 
(1, 2, 3, 4)     (1.3.5-21) 
 
The number of interchanges by which (3, 2, 4, 1) is reordered into (1, 2, 3, 4) is therefore 
not unique; however, what is unique is that (3, 2, 4, 1) can only be reordered into (1, 2, 3, 
4) in an even (0, 2, 4, 6) number of steps. 
 
(3, 2, 4, 1) is therefore said to be an even parity permutation of (1,2,3,4). 
 
If N = 3, we have the following parity assignments 
 
   Even         Odd 
(1, 2, 3)     (3, 2, 1) 
(2, 3, 1)     (2, 1, 3) 
(3, 1, 2)     (1, 3, 2) 
 
 
            1                                                  1 
 
 
3                      2                        3                            2 
 
even = “clockwise order”      odd = “counter-clockwise order” 
 
so E123 = E231 = E312 = +1    ,      E321 = E213 = E132 = -1 
 
while   E111 = E112 = E121 = E233 = 0     (1.3.5-22) 
 
For N = 2, E2 = +1,  E21 = -1     (1.3.5-23)

In the general formula (1.3.5-16) for det(A), we must have an expression that is define for 
N > 3m and that allows us to prove various properties of the determinant to show that it is 
valid measure for determining existence/uniqueness of solutions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

In general, we can determine the parity (even or odd) of a permutation (i1, i2, …, iN) by 
the following method: 
 
For each M = 1, 2, …., N, let 
that are smaller then iM.   
 
The total number of inversion (pairwise interchanges) required to reorder (i1, i2, …, iN) 
into (1, 2, …, N) using a particular straight-forward strategy is 
 

 be the number of integers in the set {i

M+1, iM+2, … , iN}

V =  ∑ −

=

Mα      (1.3.5-39)

If v is even, (i1, i2, …, iN) is even (note : 0 counts as even). 
If v is odd, (i1, i2, …, iN) is odd parity permutation. 
 
This provides a well-defined rule to determining the value of  
i,iE

We now use the definition (1.3.5-16) of the determinant to prove several properties of the 
determinant. 
 
Property I: 
 

det(AT) = det(A)     (1.3.5-40) 

 
Proof: 
 
The determinant of the transpose of A is det(AT) =

order of 2nd subscripts   (1, 2, …, N)     (j1, j2, …, jN) 
 
If we perform v pairwise exchanges to convert (i1, i2, …, iN)     (cid:198)  (1, 2, …, N), 
Then in the same # of steps (1, 2, …, N) (cid:198) (j1, j2, …, jN). 
 
Therefore, 
 
Using the definition of the transpose,  a

Property II: 
 
If every element in a row (column) of A is zero, then det(A) = 0. 
 
Proof: 
 
 
Let every element in column #M of A be zero.  Then, in the formula for the determinant, 
 

det(A) =

We see that  a
= 0. 
 
Let us now say that every element in row #M of a matrix B is zero.  When we take the 
transpose, bT
ij = bji, so every element in the mth column of BT is zero.  By the result 
above, det(BT) = 0.  Using property I, (1.3.5-45), we then have det(B) = 0.

If every element in a row (column) of a matrix A is multiplied by a scalar c to form a 
matrix B, then det(B) = c*det(A).

Property IX: 
 
If A is an upper-triangular or lower-triangular matrix, then det(A) is equal to the product 
of the elements along the principal diagonal. 
 
Proof: 
 
Let us consider 



L =  

Then

For every permutation (ii, i2, …, IN) of (1, 2, …, N), we must have 
 

i1 + i2 + … + iN = 1 + 2 + … + N     (1.3.5-69) 

 
So, in the expression above for det(L), if we have some LM, IM where IM>M, then we 
must have some other Ir<r in the product.  As Lir,r = 0 for Ir < r, all terms with any off-
diagonal elements of L are zero.  The only term in det(L) that survives is i1 = 1, i2 = 2, …, 
iE
1,...iE
IN = N,

So

det(L) = L11L2…LNN     (1.3.5-70)

We can now demonstrate that this functional form for det(A) satisfies all of the required 
characteristics that were identified on pages 1.3.5-2 and 1.3.5-5.

We therefore have in equation (1.3.5-16) a form for det(A) that we can use to judge 
existence/unqueness. 
 
In practice, the most efficient way to compute det(A), or at least its magnitude, is to use 
property IX.  Since row operations do not change values of the determinant (property 
VII), and exchanging 2 rows only changes the sign (property IV), then after N3 FLOP’s 
to perform Gaussian elimination with pivoting, we put A into an upper triangular form U 
such that 
 

det(A) =  ± U11U22…UNN     (1.3.5-73) 

 
This method is much faster than performing all of the summations necessary to evaluate 
(1.3.5-16) directly.
