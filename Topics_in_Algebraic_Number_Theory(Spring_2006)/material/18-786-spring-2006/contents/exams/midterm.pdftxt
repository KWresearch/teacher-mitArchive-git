18.786  Detachable  Midterm:  April  6,  2006


Please  turn  in  at  least  2  of  the  following  four  problems  during  the  class  period.  Please 
turn in the remaining problems on Thursday, April 13 (no extensions!).  Please do not discuss 
the  midterm  problems  until  after  the  detached  problems  come  due.  Also,  please  write  your 
name  on  each  problem  page ;  you may  as  well  do  this  now. 
This  midterm  is  “open  materials”;  during  the  class  period,  you  may  use  Janusz’s  book, 
your  course  notes,  or  your  problem  sets.  For  the  detached  problems,  you  may  use  any 
resource  you want  except  for  another  human  being;  this  includes  computer  programs.  Keep 
this  in mind as you decide which problems  to work on here.  (Warning:  the  fact  that “SAGE 
says that the answer is xxx” does not by itself constitute an adequate justiﬁcation!  All proofs 
must  be  readable  by  a  suﬃciently  diligent  human,  namely  me.)  Each  problem  has  3  parts; 
each  part  of  each  problem  is  equally  weighted. 
The  rest  of  this  page  is  intentionally  blank;  you  may  use  it  for  scratch  work.  Please  do 
not  turn  in  this  page;  put  all work  to  be  submitted  on  the  problem  sheets  (you may  use  the 
back  of  the  page). 

1.  Deﬁne  the polynomial P (x) = x3 + 2x − 4x + 2;  it  can be  shown  that P  is  irreducible 
2
and  its  discriminant  is −140. 

(a)  Compute  the  signature  (number  of  real  and  complex  embeddings)  of  P . 
(a)  Check  that  the  ring  of  integers  of  K  =  Q[x]/(P (x))  is  equal  to  Z[x].  (Hint:  shorten 
the  computation  using  results  from  class  and/or  Janusz.) 

(c)  Determine the factorization (with values of e and f ) in oK  of the ideals (2), (3), (5), (7). 

2.  Write  down  examples  of  the  following.  (You  do  not  need  to  provide  more  than  one 
sentence  of  justiﬁcation.) 

(a)  Two  number  ﬁelds  (not  necessarily  of  the  same  degree)  with  the  same  discriminant 
(including  the  sign). 

(b)  A  number  ﬁeld  of  degree  12  ramiﬁed  only  above  2  and  3. 
(c)  Two number ﬁelds K  and L which are  linearly disjoint over Q,  such  that  the  composi­
tum  LK  is  everywhere  unramiﬁed  over K . 

√
3.  Let K  be  the  number  ﬁeld Q(

√−5). 
2, 
(a)  Prove  that  the  group  of  units  of K  has  rank  1. 
K is  {±1}.  (Hint:  you  can  use  ramiﬁcation 
(b)  Prove  that  the  torsion  subgroup  of  o
∗ 
considerations  to  restrict  the  order.) 
(c)  Find  an  element  of  o∗ 
K of  inﬁnite  order.  (Hint:  look  at  subﬁelds.)


4.  Let  K  be  the  number  ﬁeld  Q[x]/(x − 5).  It  can  be  shown  that  oK  =  Z[x]/(x − 5);

you may  assume  this  without  proof. 

(a)  Compute  the  discriminant  of K . 

(b)  Compute  a  constant  C  such  that  for  every  ideal  a  of  oK ,  there  is  an  element  α  of  a 
with  Norm(α) ≤ C Norm(a).

(c)  Prove  that  the  class  group  of  oK  is  trivial.  (Hint:  the  hard  part  is  to  check  that  there 
are  no  nonprincipal  ideals  of  norm  2  or  3.)
