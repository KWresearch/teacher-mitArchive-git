18.786:  Topics  in  Algebraic  Number  Theory  (spring  2006) 
Take­home  ﬁnal  exam,  due  Thursday,  May  18  at  the  end  of  lecture 

Please  submit  exactly  eight  of  the  following  problems.  As  usual,  each  numbered  item 
constitutes a single problem,  even  if  it  is broken up  into  lettered subparts, and each problem 
has  equal  value. 
You may consult any resources except a human being other than me (so in particular, you 
may  not  collaborate  with  others  in  the  class).  This  includes  Janusz,  other  books,  anything 
on  the  Internet,  SAGE,  other  software,  notes  from  class,  problem  sets,  and  anything  else  I 
didn’t  think  of. 
Note  that  I  did  allow  for  the  possibility  of  asking  me  for  help.  Any  response  (including 
corrections  if  any  are  found)  will  be  copied  to  virtual  oﬃce  hours  so  everyone  receives  the 
beneﬁt  of  it. 
1.  Let  P (x) ∈ Z[x]  be  a monic  polynomial  whose  roots  are  all  real  and  lie  in  the  interval

6.  Let  K  be  the  maximal  totally  real  subﬁeld  of  the  cyclotomic  ﬁeld  Q(ζn ).  Let  a  be  an 
ideal  of  oK  such  that  aZ[ζn ]  is  principal.  Prove  that  a  is  already  principal. 
7.  Let P (x) ∈ Z[x] be  a monic polynomial  of  prime  degree n which  is  irreducible modulo 
some  prime  p,  and which  has  exactly  two  nonreal  roots.  Prove  that  the Galois  closure 
of  the  extension K  = Q[x]/P (x)  over Q  has Galois  group  Sn .

8.  Let K  be a ﬁnite extension of Q3 , and let L/K  be a Galois extension with group S3  (the 
symmetric  group  on  three  letters).  Prove  that K  is wildly  ramiﬁed,  that  is,  e(L/K )  is 
divisible  by  3. 
9.  Let K  be  the  completion  of  the maximal  unramiﬁed  extension  of Qp . 

(a)  Prove  that  there  is  a  unique  continuous  automorphism  σ  of K  which  induces  the 
Frobenius  x  �→ xp  on  the  residue  ﬁeld  of K .

and  determine  e(R/k [[t]])  and  f (R/k [[t]]).  (Hint:  the  ﬁeld  extension  is  Galois.) 
(b)  Exhibit	 an  example  of  a  ﬁnite  integral  extension  S/R  of  DVRs  which  is  not 
monogenic,  but  for  which  Frac(S )/ Frac(R)  is  separable.  (Hint:  if  the  residue 
ﬁeld  extension  is  not monogenic,  then  S/R  can’t  be  either.)
