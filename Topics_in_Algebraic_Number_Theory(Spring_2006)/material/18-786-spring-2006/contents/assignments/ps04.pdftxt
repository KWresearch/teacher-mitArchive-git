Reminder:  a  ring  extension  S/R  is  monogenic  if  S  ∼ R[x]/(P (x))  for  some  polynomial 
= 
P (x) ∈ R[x].  Also,  oK  denotes  the  ring  of  integers  in  a  number  ﬁeld K .

7.  Show  by  an  example  that  a  rational  prime  p  can  be  totally  ramiﬁed  in  two  diﬀerent 
number  ﬁelds  K1  and  K2  without  being  totally  ramiﬁed  in  the  compositum  K1K2 . 
(Hint:  you  can  do  this  with  two  quadratic  extensions.)

7.)  Let R1  ⊆ R2  be an inclusion of DVRs, with R2  ﬁnite integral over R1 , such that the 
residue  ﬁeld  extension  R2/mR2  of  R1/mR1  is  separable.  Prove  that  R2  is  a  monogenic 
extension  of  R1 .  (Hint:  ﬁrst  check  the  unramiﬁed  case,  where  mR2  = mR1 R2 ,  and  the 
totally  ramiﬁed  case, where R2/mR2  = R1/mR1 .  Then  combine  the arguments  in  those 
two  cases.) 
(a)  Let  K  be  a  number  ﬁeld  such  that  oK  is  monogenic  over  Z.  Prove  that  for 
each  rational  prime  p,  there  are  at  most  p  primes  q  of  oK  lying  over  (p)  with 
f (q/(p)) = 1. 
(b)  Use (a) to produce an example of a number ﬁeld K  such that oK  is not monogenic 
over  Z. 
(c)  For	 your  example  in  (b),  exhibit  a  rational  integer  N  such  that  (oK )[1/N ]  is 
monogenic over Z[1/N ], then determine the splitting and ramiﬁcation of all primes 
p  dividing N . 
10.	 Let  K  be  the  number  ﬁeld  Q[x]/(x − x + 2).  Use  SAGE  to  determine,  among  the 
3
primes  p  <  10000,  how  many  have  each  of  the  possible  splitting  types.  Then  make 
a  guess  about  the  asymptotics  (which  will  be  conﬁrmed  by  the  Chebotarev  Density 
Theorem).
