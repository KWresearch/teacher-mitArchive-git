18.786:  Topics  in  Algebraic  Number  Theory  (spring  2006) 
Problem  Set  7,  due  Thursday,  April  13 

Reminder:  the  detached  part  of  the  midterm  is  also  due  on  April  13;  no  extensions  on 
that! 

1.  Leftover from last time:  here is Kummer’s original motivation for developing the theory 
of  ideals  and  the  like.  Let  p  >  3  be  a  rational  prime  which  does  not  divide  the  class 
number  of  Q(ζp );  such  a  prime  p  is  said  to  be  regular.  (Optional:  web  search  to  ﬁnd 
out more  about  regular  and  irregular  primes.)  Suppose  that we  had  a  counterexample 
p  + y p  + z p  = 0  to  the  Fermat  conjecture  with  p  � |xyz . 
x
(a)  Prove  that  for  i  = 0, . . . , p − 1,  x + ζ iy  is  equal  to  a  p­th  power  times  a  unit  in 
Z[ζp ].  (Hint:  check  that  the  ideals  (x + ζ iy)  are  pairwise  coprime.) 
(b)  Prove  that  for  some  integer m, 
xζ m  + yζ m−1  ≡ xζ −m  + yζ 1−m 
p

(mod  p).

(Hint:  use  a  problem  from  the  previous  pset.) 
(a)  Prove that in (b), we must have 2m ≡ 1  (mod  p) and deduce that x ≡ y  (mod  p). 
Since  the  same  argument  yields  x ≡ z  (mod  p),  this  yields  a  contradiction. 
2.  Prove  that  the  10­adic  completion  of  Z  is  not  a  domain.  Optional  (not  to  be  turned 
in):  prove that the N ­adic completion of Z is isomorphic to the product of Zp  over all p 
dividing N  (in  particular,  it  only  depends  on  the  squarefree  part  of N ).  Also  optional 
(also  not  to  be  turned  in):  generalize  to  any  Dedekind  domain. 
3.  Prove that an element of Qp  is rational if and only if its base p expansion is terminating 
or  periodic  (to  the  left,  that  is).

5.  Janusz  p.  99,  exercise  7. 
6.  Let P (x) be a polynomial with coeﬃcients  in Zp , and suppose r ∈ Zp  satisﬁes  P (r) < 
|
|
P � (r) .  Prove that starting from r , the Newton iteration z  �→ z−P (z )/P � (z ) converges

to  a  root  of  P ;  deduce  as  a  corollary  that  such  a  root  exists.  This  leads  to  a  proof  of 
Hensel’s Lemma, as well as a good algorithm for computing roots of p­adic polynomials. 

7.  (Optional) A DVR satisfying the conclusion of Hensel’s lemma (say,  in the formulation 
given  in the previous exercise)  is said to be henselian ;  such a DVR satisﬁes most of the 
interesting  properties  of  complete  DVRs,  like  the  theorems  about  extending  absolute 
values. 
(a)  Let	 R  be  the  integral  closure  of  Z(p)  in  Zp .  Prove  that  R  is  a  henselian  DVR 
which  is  not  complete.

(b)  Let	 R  be  the  ring  of  formal  power  series  over  C  which  converge  on  some  disc 
around  the  origin.  Prove  that  R  is  a  henselian  DVR  which  is  not  complete. 

8.  Let R  be  a  complete DVR whose  fraction  ﬁeld  is  of  characteristic  0  and whose  residue 
ﬁeld κ is perfect of characteristic p > 0 (e.g., R = Zp ).  Prove that for each x ∈ κ, there 
exists  a  unique  lift  of  x  into  R  which  has  a  pn ­th  root  in  R  for  all  positive  integers  n. 
(Hint:  deﬁne a sequence whose n­th term is obtained by choosing some lift of x1/pn  and 
raising  it  to  the  pn ­th  power.  Show  that  this  sequence  converges.)  This  lift,  usually 
denoted  [x],  is  called  the  Teichm¨ul ler  lift  of  x. 
(a)  Prove  that  the  ﬁeld  Qp  has  no  nontrivial  automorphisms  as  a  ﬁeld,  even  if  you 
don’t  ask  for  continuity.  (Hint:  use  the  previous  exercise,  but  beware  that  you 
aren’t  given  that  the  automorphism  carries  Zp  into  itself.) 
(b)  Prove  that  for  p  and  q  distinct  primes,  the  ﬁelds  Qp  and  Qq  are  not  isomorphic. 
(Hint:  which  elements  of Qq  have  p­th  roots?)

10.	 If you postponed PS 4 problem 8, solve it now as follows.  (Parts (a) and (b) are related 
to  the  hint  from PS  4.)  Throughout,  let R�/R  be  a ﬁnite  extension  of DVRs  such  that 
the  residue  ﬁeld  extension  is  separable. 
(a)  Suppose  R  is  complete  (as  then  is  R� ).  Prove  that  there  exists  a  unique  interme­
diate DVR R��  such that R��/R  is unramiﬁed and R�/R��  is totally ramiﬁed.  (Hint: 
apply  the  primitive  element  theorem  to  the  residue  ﬁeld,  then  lift  the  resulting 
polynomial  and  apply  Hensel’s  lemma  to  it.) 
(b)  In the situation of (a), prove that R�  is monogenic over R.  (Hint:  add a uniformizer 
to  an  element  generating  the  unramiﬁed  subextension.)  extension.) 
(c)  In  the  situation  of  (a),  choose  x  such  that  R�  = R[x].  Prove  that  there  exists  an 
integer  n  such  that  if  x − y ∈ mn  ,  then  also R�  = R[y ].  (That  is,  any  suﬃciently 
R� 
R and  ��  denote the respective completions.  Prove 
(d)  Now let R be arbitrary, and let  �
good  approximation  to  a  generator  is  again  a  generator.) 
that  [ ��  :  �	
R R] = [R�  : R],  or  equivalently,  that  the  natural  map  �
�
R
R ⊗R  R�  R�  is  a 
→
�
bijection.  (Hint:  you  can  prove  the  latter  by  viewing  the  map  as  a  morphism  of 
R­modules  and  use  Nakayama’s  lemma.) 
with  �R�  = R[x].  Then  use  (d)  to  show  that  also  R�  = R[x].) 
�
(e)  Show  that  R�/R  is  monogenic.  (Hint:  use  (a)­(c)  to  produce  an  element  x  ∈  R� 
11.	 The  ring  Z(5) [x]/(x +  1)  is  ﬁnite  integral  over  the  DVR  Z(5)  but  injects  into  the 
2
completion  Z5 .  Why  doesn’t  that  contradict  part  (d)  of  the  previous  problem?
