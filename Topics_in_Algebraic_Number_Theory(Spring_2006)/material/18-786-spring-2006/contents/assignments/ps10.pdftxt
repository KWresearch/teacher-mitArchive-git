Problem  Set  10,  due  Thursday,  May  4 

This  will  be  the  last  problem  set;  it  will  be  followed  by  a  take­home  ﬁnal  exam  due  on 
the  last  day  of  classes  (May  18),  whose  scope  will  be  equal  to  that  of  these  problem  sets, 
i.e.,  roughly  chapters  1­3  of  Janusz. 
Handy  notation:  for  L  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp  and  i  ≥  0,  let  Ui (L)  be  the  subgroup  of 
∗ consisting  of  units  congruent  to  1 modulo m

1.  Let  K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp ,  and  let  L  be  a  ﬁnite  Galois  extension  of  K ;  the 
purpose  of  this  exercise  is  to  prove  that G = Gal(L/K )  is  solvable.  (For more  details, 
see  Serre’s  Local  Fields.) 
(a)  For  each  integer	 i  ≥  −1,  let  Gi  be  the  set  of  g  ∈  G  such  that  for  all  x  ∈  oL , 
g(x) − x ∈ mL
i+1 .  Prove  that Gi  is  a  subgroup  of G. 
(b)  Prove  that G0  is  the  inertia  subgroup  of G. 
(c)  Let  π  be  a  uniformizer  of  L.  Show  that  for  each  i ≥  0,  the  function  g  �→  g(π)/π 
induces  an  injective  homomorphism Gi/Gi+1  → Ui (L)/Ui+1 (L). 
(d)  Deduce  from  (c)  that G0/G1  is  cyclic  of  order  prime  to  p,  and  for  i > 0, Gi/Gi+1 
is  abelian  of  exponent  p.  Then  note  that  Gi  =  {e}  for  i  large,  so  G  is  in  fact 
solvable. 
(e)  Show  that  if G  is  abelian,  then  the map G0/G1  � κ→
∗ 
L  given  in  (c)  actually maps 
∗ .K
into  κ This  will  be  useful  later. 
2.  Here’s  the  non­Galois  version  of  what  I  said  in  class  on  April  25. 

(a)  Let L/K  be a ﬁnite extension of number ﬁelds and let M /K  be a Galois extension 
containing  L.  Put  G  = Gal(M /K )  and  H  = Gal(M /L).  Let  p  be  a  prime  ideal 
of oK , and  let q be a prime of oM  above p.  Prove that there  is a bijection between 
the  double  cosets H/G\G(q)  and  the  primes  of  oL  above  p,  taking  a  double  coset 
representative  g  to  L ∩ g(q). 
(b)  Let	 L/K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  number  ﬁelds.  Deduce  from  (a)  that  a  prime 
ideal  of  K ,  which  does  not  ramify  in  L,  is  totally  split  in  L  if  and  only  if  it  is 
totally  split  in  the  Galois  closure  of  L/K . 
(c)  (Optional,  not  to  be  turned  in)  Think  about  how  to  extract	 e  and  f  from  this 
group­theoretic  setup. 

3.	

(a)  (Galois;  optional,  but  you’re  encouraged  to  at  least  look  this  up)  Let  G  be  a 
solvable  group  which  acts  faithfully  and  transitively  on  a  ﬁnite  set  of  prime  car­
dinality.  Prove  that  no  non­identity  element  of G  has  two  ﬁxed  points.

(b)  (Schmidt) Let L/K  be an extension of number ﬁelds of prime degree, whose Galois 
closure  is  solvable.  Prove  that  if  p  is  a  prime  ideal  of  K  which  does  not  ramify 
in  L,  and  there  are  at  least  two  primes  of  L  above  p  of  relative  degree  1,  then  p 
splits  completely  in  L. 
(a)  Let K  be an abelian extension of Q unramiﬁed away from a single prime p.  Prove 
that there  is a unique prime of K  above p, and that this prime  is totally ramiﬁed. 
(Hint:  where  does  the  inertia  ﬁeld  ramify?) 
(b)  Let	 G  be  a  p­group.  The  Frattini  subgroup  F  of  G  is  the  intersection  of  the 
maximal  proper  subgroups  of  G.  Prove  that  G/F  is  the  maximal  quotient  of  G 
which  is  abelian  of  exponent  p. 
(c)  Let	 K  be  a  Galois  extension  of  Q  of  prime  power  degree,  which  is  unramiﬁed 
away  from  a  single  prime  p  (not  necessarily  the  same  prime  as  the  one  dividing 
the degree).  Prove that there  is a unique prime of K  above p, and that this prime 
is  totally  ramiﬁed.  (Hint:  use  Frattini  to  reduce  to  (a).) 
(d)  Let  K/Q  be  an  abelian  extension  of  2­power  degree  unramiﬁed  outside  2.  Prove 
that  K  ⊆ Q(ζ2m )  for  some  m.  (Hint:  ﬁrst  reduce  to  the  case  where  K  is  totally 
√−1).  Then  for  m 
real,  by  replacing  K  with  the  maximal  real  subﬁeld  of  K (
large,  count  quadratic  subextensions  of K (ζ2m )  to  prove  that K (ζ2m )/Q  is  cyclic, 
and  then  deduce  the  claim.)  Optional:  is  this  still  true  when  K  is  only  Galois, 
not  just  abelian? 
5.  The  Kronecker­Weber  theorem  asserts  that  every  ﬁnite  abelian  extension  of  Q  is  con­
tained  in  some  Q(ζn ).  The  local  Kronecker­Weber  theorem  asserts  that  every  ﬁnite 
abelian  extension  of  Qp  is  contained  in  some  Qp (ζn ).  Prove  that  local  KW  implies 
global KW,  as  follows. 
� 
(a)  Given  an  abelian  extension  K  of  Q,  use  local  KW  to  prove  that  there  exists 
pep  such  that  for  each p which  ramiﬁes  in K ,  and  each prime p of K  above 
n = 
p,  we  have 
Kp  ⊆ Qp (ζpep mp ) 

for  some mp  coprime  to  p. 
(b)  Prove  that  the  Galois  group  of  K (ζn )  is  isomorphic  to  the  product  of  its  inertia 
groups,  and  deduce  K (ζn ) =  Q(ζn ).  (Hint:  ﬁrst  show  that  the  Galois  group 
contains  the  product,  using  the  fact  that Q(ζpn )  does  not  ramify  outside  p.  Then 
use Minkowski’s  theorem  to  get  equality.) 
6.  Put K  = Qp (ζp ). 
(a)  Prove  that  as  abelian  groups, 
Z/(p−1)Z  × U1 (K ).
K ∗  = (1 − ζp )
Z  × ζp−1 

.

(b)  Prove  that  U1 (K )p  = Up+1 (K ),  so  that 
× Up+1 (K ). 
(K ∗ )p  = (1 − ζp )pZ  × ζp−1 
Z/(p−1)Z
(Hint:  the  case  p = 2  was  on  an  earlier  homework.) 

7.  I’m  going  to  use  a  little Kummer  theory  later,  so  here  is  a  review. 

(a)  (Look  it up,  but don’t  turn  it  in) Let n be  a positive  integer,  and  let K  be  a ﬁeld 
of  characteristic  coprime  to  n.  Suppose  that K  contains  the  primitive  n­th  roots 
of unity.  Then  every Galois  extension of K  with Galois group Z/nZ has  the  form 
K (x1/n )  for  some  x ∈ K ∗  which  is  not  a  d­th  power  in  K  for  any  d >  1  dividing 
n. 
(b)  Let  n  be  a  positive  integer,  and  let  K  be  a  ﬁeld  of  characteristic  coprime  to  n, 
but  now  don’t  suppose  that K  contains  the  primitive  n­th  roots  of  unity.  Deﬁne 
the  homomorphism  ω  : Gal(K (ζn )/K ) → (Z/nZ)∗  by  the  property  g(ζn ) = ζn 
ω(g)
. 
Put  M  =  K (ζn , a1/n )  for  some  a  ∈  K (ζn )∗ .  Prove  that  M /K  is  abelian  if  and 
only  if  for  all  g ∈ Gal(K (ζn )/K ),  g(a)/aω(g)  is  an  n­th  power  in K (ζn ). 
8.  Prove  local  Kronecker­Weber  as  follows.	 (This  follows  Washington’s  Introduction  to 
Cyclotomic  Fields.) 
(a)  Let  e  be  an  integer  coprime  to  p.  Prove  that  Qp ((−p)1/e )  is  Galois  over  Qp  if 
and  only  if  e p − 1.  (Hint:  remember  from  an  earlier  pset  that Qp ((−p)1/(p−1) ) = 
|
Qp (ζp ).) 
(b)  Let K/Qp  be a ﬁnite abelian extension of q ­power order, for some prime q =�
p.  Let 
L be the maximal unramiﬁed subextension of K , and put e = [K  : L].  Prove that 
K (ζe ) = L(ζe , (−pu)1/e ) for some u ∈ o∗ 
1/e )/Qp
is unramiﬁed. 
L(ζe ) , and that L(ζe , u
(c)  In  the  notation  of  (b),  let  pn  be  the  cardinality  of  the  residue  ﬁeld  of  L(ζe , u1/e ). 
Prove  that K  ⊆ Qp (ζp(pn −1) ). 
(d)  Let  p  be  an  odd  prime.  Prove  that  there  is  no  extension  of Qp  with Galois  group 
(Z/pZ)3 .  (Hint:  let  K  be  such  an  extension,  apply  Kummer  theory  (both  parts 
of  problem  7)  to  describe K (ζp )  over Qp (ζp ),  then  use  problem  6.) 
(e)  Prove  that  there  is  no  extension  of  Q2  with  Galois  group  (Z/2Z)4  or  (Z/4Z)3 . 
(Hint:  in  the  second  case,  reduce  to  showing  that  there  is  no  extension  of  Q2 
√−1)  with Galois  group  Z/4Z.) 
containing Q2 (
(f )  Deduce local Kronecker­Weber from all this.  (This is similar to 4(d); for p = 2, use 
the fact that there are cyclotomic extensions of Q2  with group (Z/2Z) × (Z/2nZ)2 
for  any  n.) 

9.  (Optional,  not  to be  turned  in)  In  this problem  and  the next, we  give  a direct proof  of 
Kronecker­Weber (not going through the  local version), modulo an  important theorem 
which  we  did  not  discuss  from  the  theory  of  cyclotomic  ﬁelds.  This  argument  is  due 
to  Franz  Lemmermeyer.

(a)  Let K/Q  be  a  cyclic  extension  of  degree  p  unramiﬁed  outside  p.  Put  F  = Q(ζp ); 
by  Kummer  theory,  we  can  write  K F  =  F (µ1/p )  for  some  µ  ∈  oF .  Prove  that 
for  any  prime  q  of  F ,  if  vq (µ)  �≡ 0  (mod  p),  then  q  splits  completely  in  F .  (Hint: 
look  at  the  decomposition  group  of  q  and  use  the  previous  problem.) 
(b)  Deduce  from  (b)  that  the  ideal  (µ)  is  a  p­th power.  (Hint:  the prime  (1 − ζ ) does 
not  ﬁt  the  criterion  in  (b).) 
(c)  Write	 ga  for  the  element  of  Gal(F /Q)  corresponding  to  a  ∈  (Z/pZ)∗ .  Then 
Stickelberger’s theorem  (see, e.g., Washington’s Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields ) 
� 
implies  that  for  any  fractional  ideal  a  of  F ,  the  fractional  ideal 
p−1
g−1 (a  )
a
a 
a=1 

is  principal.  (Yes,  that’s  really  the  a­th  power  where  a  is  viewed  as  an  integer, 
not  as  an  element  of  (Z/pZ)∗ .  Weird,  isn’t  it?)  Use  Stickelberger’s  theorem  to 
prove  that  the  ideal  (µ)  is  the  p­th  power  of  a  principal  ideal. 
(e)  Remember  from  an  earlier  pset  that  every  unit  in	 oF  is  equal  to  a  power  of  ζ 
times  a  unit  in  the  ring  of  integers  of  the maximal  real  subﬁeld  of  F .  Using  this, 
deduce  that  µ  is  a  power  of  ζ  times  a  p­th  power,  and  hence  K L = Q(ζp2 );  that 
is, K  ⊆ Q(ζp2 ). 
10.	 (Optional,  not  to  be  turned  in)  This  exercise  concludes  the  direct  proof  of Kronecker­
Weber  begun  in  the  previous  exercise. 
(a)  Let K/Q be a cyclic extension of p­power order,  for p prime,  in which some prime 
q = p  ramiﬁes.  Prove  that  p must  divide  q − 1.  (Hint:  use  problem  1(e)  above.) 
(b)  Let  K/Q  be  an  abelian  extension  which  ramiﬁes  at  some  prime  q  not  dividing 
[K  : Q].  Prove  that  there  there  exists  an  abelian  extension K �/Q  such  that: 
•  K  ⊆ K � (ζq ); 
•  [K �  : Q]  divides  [K  : Q]; 
•  every  prime  that  ramiﬁes  in K �  also  ramiﬁes  in K ; 
•  q  does  not  ramify  in K � . 
(Hint:  ﬁrst reduce  to the case ζq  ∈ K .  In that case,  take K �  to be  the  inertia ﬁeld 
of K  for  a  prime  above  q .) 
(c)  From  other  problems  in  this  pset,	 we  know  that  a  cyclic  extension  of  Q  of  p­
power  order  unramiﬁed  away  from  p  is  cyclotomic.  Use  (b)  to  deduce  from  this 
that  every  abelian  extension  of Q  is  contained  in  a  cyclotomic  ﬁeld.
