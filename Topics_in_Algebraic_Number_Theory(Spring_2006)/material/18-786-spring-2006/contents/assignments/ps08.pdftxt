18.786:  Topics  in  Algebraic  Number  Theory  (spring  2006) 
Problem  Set  8,  due  Thursday,  April  20 

This problem set uses heavily the fact that if K  is the fraction ﬁeld of a discrete valuation 
ring,  then  the  absolute  value  on  K  extends  uniquely  to  any  ﬁnite  extension  of  K ;  I  should 
get  to  this  by  the  end  of  class  on  the  13th. 
I  marked  a  number  of  things  “Optional”  on  here;  to  make  up  for  it,  please  make  sure 
to  do  at  least  one  “Optional”  part.  (That  is,  the  parts  are  all  optional  individually  but  not 
collectively.) 
1.  Let  Ui  be  the  group  of  x ∈ Zp  with  x ≡ 1  (mod  pi ).  Prove  that  if  p = 2  and  i ≥ 1,  or 
p = 2  and  i ≥ 2,  then  Ui  is  torsion­free.  (Hint:  use  exp  and  log.)

2.  Determine  the  radius  of  convergence  of  the  Taylor  series  for  sin x  over Qp . 
∞  nanxn−1 
∞
n=0 anxn  and  its  formal  derivative 
3.  Prove  that  a  formal  power  series 
n=1 
have  the  same  radius  of  convergence  over Qp . 
(a)  Prove that the inﬁnite extension Qp (p, p1/p , p1/p2 , . . . ) of Qp  is not complete (under 
the  unique  extension  of  the  p­adic  absolute  value). 
(b)  Prove  that  the maximal  unramiﬁed  extension  of Qp  is  not  complete  either. 
(c)  Optional:  prove  that  any  inﬁnite  algebraic  extension  of Qp  is  not  complete. 
5.  (Optional,  possibly  tricky)  Let  Cp  be  the  completion  of  an  algebraic  closure  of  Qp  for 
the  unique  extension  of  the  p­adic  absolute  value.  Prove  that Cp  is  again  algebraically 
closed;  the  ﬁeld  Cp  is  loosely  analogous  to  the  usual  complex  numbers  in  ordinary 
analysis.

6.  In  this  exercise,  you  will  check  some  of  the  basic  properties  of  Newton  polygons  I

outlined in class.  Let K  be the fraction ﬁeld of a DVR R.  For P (x) = anx
K [x] with an , a0  = 0, consider the set of points {(−i, v(ai )) : i = 0, . . . , n}  in R2 .  Their 
lower  convex  hull  is  the  Newton  polygon  of  P ;  I’ll  think  of  this  polygon  as  consisting 
of  n  separate  segments  of  horizontal  width  1. 
(a)  Let  r1 , . . . , rn  be  the  roots  of  P  in  some  ﬁnite  extension K �  of K .  Assume  that  v 
extends  uniquely  to  K �  (we’ll  prove  this  in  class;  note  that  v  is  normalized  with 
respect  to K ,  not K � ).  Prove  that  the  slopes  of  the Newton polygon  are precisely 
v(r1 ), . . . , v(rn ).  (Hint:  sort  the  ri  so  that  v(r1 )  ≤  · · ·  ≤  v(rn ).  Then  check 
n ) ≥ v(r1 ) + · · · 

+ v(ri ).  Then check that equality holds  if v(ri ) < v(ri+1 ),
v(an−i/a
or  if  i = n.)

(b)  Prove	 that  the  Newton  polygon  of  P Q  is  obtained  by  “merging”  the  Newton 
polygons  of  P  and  Q:  that  is,  the  number  of  segments  of  the  Newton  polygon 
of  P Q  of  any  given  slope  is  the  sum  of  the  corresponding  numbers  for  P  and  Q. 
(Hint:  this  can  be  done  directly,  but  use  (a)  instead.)

(c)  As  an  example,  compute  the  p­adic  absolute  values  of  the  roots  of  x5  − 2x2  + 16 
in  an  algebraic  closure  of  Q2 .  (I  suspect  SAGE  can  verify  this  by  approximating 
the  roots  numerically.) 
(a)  Let K  be  a  ﬁnite  unramiﬁed  extension  of  Qp .  Prove  that  there  is  a  unique  auto­
morphism  of  K  over  Qp  lifting  the  p­power  Frobenius  map  on  the  residue  ﬁeld. 
(Optional:  state  and  prove  a  generalization  to  an  arbitrary  ﬁnite  unramiﬁed  ex­
tension  between  the  fraction  ﬁelds  of  two  complete  DVRs.) 
(b)  (Optional) Exhibit examples to show that neither the existence nor the uniqueness 
in  (a)  need  hold  if  K  is  ramiﬁed.  (Hint:  for  the  non­existence  you  must  use  a 
non­Galois  extension.) 
8.  Let R be a discrete valuation ring with fraction ﬁeld K , and let | · | be a nonarchimedean 
absolute  value  on K  with  valuation  ring  R.  Prove  that  for  any  extension  L  of K ,  not 
necessarily  ﬁnite,  there  exists  an  extension  of  | · |  to  a  nonarchimedean  absolute  value 
of  L.  (Hint:  use  Zorn’s  lemma  to  reduce  to  considering  a  single  algebraic  extension, 
which  we  treated  in  class,  and  a  single  purely  transcendental  extension.) 

9.  Here  is  a  surprising  application  of  the  p­adic  absolute  value  due  to  Paul Monsky.  It  is 
to  prove  that  in  Euclidean  geometry,  you  cannot  dissect  a  square  into  an  odd  number 
of  triangles  of  equal  area! 

(a)  Apply  the  previous  exercise  to  show  that  there  exists  a  nonarchimedean  absolute 
value  | · |2  on  R  for  which  2 2  < 1.

(b)  Deﬁne  the  following  subsets  of  R2 : 
A = {(x, y) ∈ R2  :  x 2  < 1, y 2  < 1}
|
|
| |
|2  ≥ | |2}
B  = {(x, y) ∈ R2  :  x 2  ≥ 1, x
|
|
|
y
C  = {(x, y) ∈ R2  :  y 2  ≥ 1, y 2  > x 2}.
| |
| |
|
|
Verify  that  A, B , C  form  a  partition  of  R2 . 
(c)  Prove  that  no  line  in  R2  meets  all  of  A, B , C .  (Hint:  note  that  A, B , C  are  all 
stable  under  translation  by  A,  then  reduce  to  the  case  where  the  line  passes 
through  the  origin.) 
(d)  Let	 R  be  the  interior  of  a  convex  polygon  of  the  plane,  dissected  into  ﬁnitely 
many  triangles.  Suppose  that  the  number  of  edges  of  R  which  ahave  one  vertex 
in  A  and  one  in  B  is  odd.  Prove  that  there  is  a  triangle  in  the  dissection  with 
one  vertex  in  each  of  A, B , C .  (Hint:  once  you  incorporate  (c),  this  is  a  purely 
combinatorial  parity  argument.) 
(e)  Prove  that  if  T  is  a  triangle  with  one  vertex  in  each  of  A, B , C ,  and  T  has  area 
K ,  then  |K 2  > 1.  (Hint:  see  (c).)

(f )  Deduce Monsky’s theorem by applying (d) to an appropriate unit square and then 
using  (e).
