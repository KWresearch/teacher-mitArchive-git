Problem  Set  2,  due  Thursday,  March  2 

Reminder:  no  class  on  February  21  or  23!  That’s  why  this  set  is  on  the  long  side.

1.  Put  R = Z[

5].  Exhibit: 

(a)  a  failure  of  unique  factorization  of  ideals  in  R; 
(b)  a  failure  of  a  local  ring  of  R  to  be  a  DVR. 

2.  These	 are  not  actually  related;  they  were  run  together  by  mistake  on  the  original 
version,  and  to  preserve  the  numbering  I  have  left  them  together  here. 

(a)  Let  R  be  an  integrally  closed  domain.  Prove  that  R[x]  is  also  integrally  closed. 
(b)  Let R be a noetherian local domain with maximal ideal m.  Prove that R is a DVR 
if and only  if m/m2 , when viewed as a vector  space over R/m,  is one­dimensional. 
(The  space  m/m2  is  called  the  cotangent  space  of  R,  because  that’s  what  it  is  in 
the  case  where  R  is  the  local  ring  of  a  point  on  a  smooth manifold.) 
3.  Determine  the  integral  closure  of  Z  in  Q[x]/(x − 2)  and  in  Q[x]/(x − x − 4).  (Re­

member:  this  means  you  have  to  ﬁrst  state  the  answer,  then  prove  that  nothing  else 
in  the  ﬁeld  is  integral!) 
4.  Let  P  ∈  C[x, y ]  be  an  irreducible  polynomial  such  that  P  is  nonsingular  in  the  aﬃne 
∂x ,  ∂ y  generate  the  unit  ideal.  Prove  that  C[x, y ]/(P )  is  a  Dedekind 
plane,  that  is,  P, ∂P

domain; among other things,  this will reveal the origin of the term “uniformizer” as an 
abbreviation for “uniformizing parameter”.  (Hint:  by the Nullstellensatz, the maximal 
ideals  of  C[x, y ]  correspond  to  points  in  C2 ,  and  the  maximal  ideals  of  C[x, y ]/(P ) 
correspond  to  points  where  P  vanishes.  Now  use  condition  2  from  Theorem  I.3.16.) 

5.  Demonstrate	 an  example  to  show  that  in  the  previous  problem,  the  nonsingularity 
condition cannot be omitted.  (Hint:  the simplest example is a node, where analytically 
two  branches  of  the  zero  locus  appear  to  cross.) 

6.  Prove  the  following  converse  of  the  unique  factorization  theorem:  let R  be  an  integral 
domain in which every nonzero ideal has a unique factorization into prime ideals.  Prove 
that R  is  a Dedekind  domain.  (Hint:  suppose  that R  has  a maximal  ideal m  of  height 
greater  than  1,  and  then  construct  a m­primary  ideal  which  is  not  a  power  of m.) 

7.  Let  R  be  a  Dedekind  domain,  let  p1 , . . . , pn  be  nonzero  prime  ideals  of  R,  and  let  S 
be  the multiplicative  subset R − (p1  ∪ · · · ∪ pn ).  Prove  that RS  is  a  PID.  (Hint:  prove 
that  RS  has  only  the  “obvious”  prime  ideals.) 

8.  Exercise  I.1  (page  13). 

9.  (a)  Do  Exercise  I.4  (page  19).

(b)  Prove that if S  is the multiplicative set generated by a single element f , the kernel 
of  the  map  C(R) → C(RS )  is  generated  by  the  classes  of  the  prime  ideals  in  the 
prime  factorization  of  (f ). 
(c)  Deduce  that  if  C(R)  is  ﬁnite,  then  there  exists  a  nonzero  f  ∈ R  such  that  Rf  is 
a  PID. 
(c)  Exhibit  an  explicit  example  where  the map C(R) → C(RS )  fails  to  be  injective. 
10.	 Here  is  a  variant  of  the  concept  of  a  PID  which  is  sometimes  useful.  A  B´ezout  ring  is

a  ring  in which  every ﬁnitely  generated  ideal  is principal.  That  is,  a B´ezout  ring  is  like 
a  PID  except  it may  not  be  noetherian,  e.g.,  the  ring  ∪∞
n=1
(a)  Prove  that  every  ﬁnitely  generated  torsion­free  module  over  a  B´ezout  domain  is 
free,  by  imitating  the  proof  in  the  PID  case.  (Optional:  generalize  other  results 
to  the  B´ezout  case,  e.g.,  the  fact  that  a  ﬁnitely  presented  pro jective module  over 
a  B´ezout  domain  is  free.) 
(b)  Let  R  be  the  integral  closure  of  Z  in  C.  Prove  that  the  localization  of  R  at  any 
maximal  ideal  is  a  B´ezout  ring  which  is  not  noetherian. 
(c)  For  0  <  r  <  1,  let  Rr  be  the  ring  of  complex  analytic  functions  on  the  annulus 
r  <  |z |  <  1.  Prove  that  R  =  Rr  is  a  B´ezout  domain  which  is  not  noetherian.

(Hint:  recall  that  the  zeroes  of  an  analytic  function  have  no  accumulation  point 
in  the  region  of  deﬁnition.) 
(d)  Optional:  prove  that  the  ring  R  in  (b)  is  itself  a  B´ezout  ring.  For  this,  you  may 
use  results  from  Janusz  that  we  have  not  yet  covered  in  class,  e.g.,  the  fact  that 
the  integral  closure  of  Z  in  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Q  is  a  Dedekind  ring,  or  the 
ﬁniteness  of  the  class  group  of  said  ring.

ﬁelds  and  pay  attention  to  the  factors  of  3.)
