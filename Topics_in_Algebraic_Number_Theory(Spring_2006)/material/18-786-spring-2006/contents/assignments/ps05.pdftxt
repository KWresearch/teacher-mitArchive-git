3.  Let  K  be  an  abelian  extension  of  Q  whose  Galois  group  is  isomorphic  to  (Z/2Z)n  for 
some  n,  and  which  is  unramiﬁed  over  all  rational  primes  p  =  2.  Prove  that  K  ⊆

Q(
(a)  Prove  that  for  each  prime  p  and  each  positive  integer  n,  there  exists  an  abelian 
extension of Q whose Galois group is cyclic of order pn , and which is only ramiﬁed 
above  p.  (Hint:  ﬁnd  it  inside  a  cyclotomic  ﬁeld.  The  case  p  =  2  is  a  little  bit 
special.) 
(b)  For  p = 3, 5  and  n = 1,  ﬁnd  an  explicit  polynomial  P (x)  such  that  the  extension 
in  (a)  is  isomorphic  to Q[x]/(P (x)). 

5.  Let  p, q  be  distinct  primes  which  are  both  congruent  to  1 modulo  4.

(b)  Prove  that Q(

(The relationship between these two statements will be explained later in terms of class 
ﬁeld  theory.) 

6.  Janusz  p.  73,  exercise  1  (this  is  related  to  the  previous  problem). 
7.  Let  E  be  the  elliptic  curve  y 2  =  x3  + x + 1  over  Q.  On  a  previous  problem  set,  I 
explained  how  the Q­points  of  E  form  an  abelian  group. 

(a)  Find  the polynomial whose  roots are  the x­coordinates of  the nontrivial 3­torsion 
points  of  E .  (Hint:  equate  2P  with −P .) 
(b)  Check  your  answer  for  (a) using SAGE.  (Hint:  you  computed  a  “division polyno­
mial”.) 
(c)  Use  SAGE  to  compute  the  Galois  group  of  the  number  ﬁeld  generated  by  the 
roots  of  the  polynomial  you  computed  in  (a). 
(d)  (Optional)  Repeat  (a)  and  (c)  for  the  5­torsion  (the  degree	 of  the  polynomial 
should  be  12),  then  note  that  the  answer  is  not  S12  (its  order  is  too  small).  How 
could  you  have  predicted  this  before  doing  the  calculation?  (Hint:  the  action  of 
the Galois  group  commutes  with  the  addition  law.) 
(e)  (Optional)  The  discriminant  of  the  polynomial  x3  + x + 1  turns  out  to  be  −31. 
Why  does  that  imply  (without  further  calculation)  that  the  number  ﬁeld  you 
∈  {3, 31}? 
considered  in  (c)  is  unramiﬁed  above  all  primes  p  /
(Hint:  for  such  p,
the  computation  of  the  division  polynomial  commutes with  reduction modulo  p.)
