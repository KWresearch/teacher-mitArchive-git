18.786:  Topics  in  Algebraic  Number  Theory  (spring  2006) 
Problem  Set  3,  due  Thursday,  March  9 

The last problem set was pretty tough and theoretical, so I’m putting some more concrete 
problems on this set.  In particular, I’m going to start suggesting problems involving the most 
basic  examples  of  number  ﬁelds,  the  quadratic  ﬁelds  and  the  cyclotomic  ﬁelds. 

1.  Janusz  p.	 28,  exercise  3.  (Hint:  if  you  think  FOO  is  the  integral  closure  of  BAR,  to 
prove  this you might want  to ﬁrst  argue  that FOO  is  integral  over BAR  and  then  that 
FOO  is  itself  integrally  closed.) 
2.  Prove  that  Fp (x1/p , y 1/p )  is  not  a  monogenic  extension  of  Fp (x, y).  (Hint:  look  at  the 
p­th  power  of  a  putative  generator.) 

3.  Do  Janusz  p.	 32,  exercise  6.  Then  describe  explicitly  which  primes  fall  into  which 
cases  for  d = −1.  Optional  (but  recommended):  do  likewise  for  d = 2. 

4.  Janusz  p.  51,  exercise  4. 
5.  Prove  that  for any prime number p,  the polynomial  (xp − 1)/(x − 1)  is  irreducible over 
Z/p2Z;  deduce  then  that  it’s  irreducible  over  Z  and  also  over  Q.  (Hint:  substitute 
y = x − 1  and  then  look  up  “Eisenstein’s  irreducibility  criterion”.) 

6.  (You  may  postpone  this  to  the  next  pset  if  you  prefer.)  Let  p  be  a  prime  and  put 
p  = exp(2π i/p).  Prove  that Z[ζp ]  is  integrally closed  in Q(ζp ).  (Hint:  as  in  the virtual 
ζ
oﬃce  hours  hint  on  PS2,  get  an  upper  bound  for  the  integral  closure  using  the  trace 
pairing  and  then  reﬁne.  Or  peek  ahead  to  Janusz  I.9.) 
7.  (A  theorem  of  Kronecker)  Let  P (x)  ∈  Z[x]  be  a  monic  polynomial  whose  roots  in  C 
all  have  absolute  value  1.  Prove  that  P (x)  divides  x − 1  for  some  n.  (Hint:  for  each 
n
integer m,  look  at  the  polynomial  Pm  whose  roots  are  the m­th  powers  of  the  roots  of 
P .	 What  can  you  say  about  the  coeﬃcients  of  Pm?) 
√
8.  For  each  squarefree  integer  d,  ﬁnd  all  of  the  roots  of  unity  in Q(
√
√
d).  (Hint:  if  there  is 
d) must  contain Q(ζp ) and  this usually  causes 
d),  then Q(
a p­th  root of unity  in Q(
dimension  problems.) 
9.  Prove that for every prime p < 100, there exists a monic polynomial P (x) ∈ Z[x] whose 
√
roots  in  C  all  have  absolute  value 
p,  such  that  the  ratio  of  no  two  of  the  roots  of  P 
is  an  algebraic  integer.  These  are  examples  of  Weil  polynomials,  which  occur  in  the 
study  of  zeta  functions  of  function  ﬁelds.  (Hint:  ﬁrst  write  down  some  examples  that 
work  for  a  general  class  of  primes.  Then  search  by  hand  or  computer  for  examples  in 
the remaining cases.  Oh, and note that the condition on the ratios can be simpliﬁed...)
