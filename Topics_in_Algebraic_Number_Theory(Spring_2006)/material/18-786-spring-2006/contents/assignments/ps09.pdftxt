4.  Let  K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp .  Let  f (x) = x + 
n
be  a  monic  polynomial 
i=0 
of  degree  n  over  K ,  which  factors  completely  over  K  with  distinct  roots  r1 , . . . , rn . 
n−1 gix is  a 
Prove  that  for  any  �  >  0,  there  exists  δ  >  0  such  that  if  g(x) =  xn  + 
i
monic  polynomial  of  degree  n  such  that  fi  − gi <  δ ,  then  g  has  n  roots  s1 , . . . , sn  in

i=0 
K ,  which  can  be  labeled  so  that  ri  − si <  �  for  i  = 1, . . . , n.  That  is,  the  roots  of 
|
|
f  vary  continuously  with  the  coeﬃcients.  (If  the  roots  are  not  distinct,  the  roots  of  g 
may  only  lie  in  an  extension  of K ,  but  otherwise  the  conclusion  still  holds.) 
5.  Let  K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp .  Prove  Krasner’s  Lemma :  if  α1 , . . . , αn  ∈  K  are 
conjugates,  and  β  ∈ K  satisﬁes 
α1  − β < α1  − αi

(i = 2, . . . , n),

then K (α1 ) ⊆ K (β ). 
6.  (Abhyankar’s  Lemma)  Let  K  be  a  ﬁnite  extension  of  Qp .  A  ﬁnite  extension  L/K  is 
said  to  be  tamely  ramiﬁed  if  e(mL/mK )  is  coprime  to  p.  Let L1 , L2  be  tamely  ramiﬁed 
extensions of K  such  that e(mL1 /mK ) divides e(mL2 /mK ).  Prove  that  the compositum 
L1L2  is  unramiﬁed  over  L2 .  (Hint:  it  is  safe  to  check  this  after  making  an  unramiﬁed 
extension  of K ,  so  you  can  assume  L1  and  L2  are  both  Kummer  extensions.) 
7.  (Dwork) Let p be a prime number.  Show that Qp (ζp ) = Qp (π)  for π  a (p − 1)­st root of 
−p

.  (Hint:  either  of  the  previous  two  exercises might  be  helpful,  or  you  can  explicitly 
construct  a  series  in  π  converging  to  ζp .)

8.  (Optional  because  it  uses  some  topology,  but  strongly  recommended)  Let  K  be  a 
number  ﬁeld.  Let  AK  be  the  subring  of  the  product  Kv ,  where  v  runs  over  places 
and  Kv  is  the  completion  at  v ,  consisting  of  tuples  (av )  in  which  av  ∈  oKv  for  all  but 
v 
� 
ﬁnitely  many  ﬁnite  places  v  (no  condition  is  imposed  at  inﬁnite  places).  Give  AK  the 
topology  with  a  basis  of  open  sets  given  by  products 
Uv ,  with  Uv  open  in  Kv  and 
v 
v  =  oKv  for  all  but  ﬁnitely  many  ﬁnite  v .  Prove  that  K ,  which  naturally  embeds 
U
→ 
into  AK  via  the  maps  K  � Kv ,  is  a  discrete  subgroup  of  AK  and  that  the  quotient 
AK /K  is  compact ;  that  is,  in  some  sense  K  is  a  “full  lattice”  in  AK .  (Hint:  start 
with  Tykhonov’s  theorem  that  any  product  of  compact  spaces  is  compact.)  The  ring 
A
K  is  the  ring  of  ad`eles  of  K ;  we’ll  likely  see  it  again  later.  (There’s  a  multiplicative 
analogue  too; more  on  that  later.)
