Throughout  these  exercises,  let  i  ∈  C  be  a  square  root  of  −1  and  let 
denote  the 
usual  absolute  value  on C.  Let Z[i]  (resp. Q(i)) be  the  subsets  of C  consisting  of  a + bi with 
a, b  ∈  Z  (resp.  a, b  ∈  Q).  Then  Z[i]  is  a  ring,  the  ring  of  Gaussian  integers,  and  Q(i)  is  its 
fraction  ﬁeld,  the  ﬁeld  of  Gaussian  rationals. 
1.  Prove  the  division  algorithm  for  Z[i]:  for  any  f , g  ∈  Z[i]  with  g  =  0,  there  exist  (not 
necessarily  unique)  q , r ∈ Z[i]  with  f  = qg + r  and  r < g .

2.  Use  the  division  algorithm  to  prove  that  Z[i]  is  a  principal  ideal  domain,  by  imitating 
the  usual  proof  for  Z. 
√−2]  are  principal  ideal 
3.  Imitate  the  previous  argument  to  prove  that  Z[e2πi/3 ]  and  Z[
domains.  (I’ll  have more  to  say  about  this  later.) 
√−5]  is not a principal  ideal domain by showing that the  ideal generated 
4.  Prove that Z[
√−5  is  not  principal.  (Hint:  if  x  divides  y ,  then  x 2  divides  y 2 .)

by  2  and  1 + 
5.  Use  arithmetic  in  Z[i]  to  prove  Fermat’s  theorem:  if  p  is  a  prime  number  and  p  ≡  1 
(mod  4),  then  there  exist  a, b ∈ Z  such  that  a2  + b2  =  p,  which  are  unique  up  to  sign 
and order.  (Hint:  for any odd prime p, you can ﬁnd x ∈ Z such that (x(p−1)/4 )2 + 1 ≡ 0 
(mod  p).) 

6.  Establish  access  to  SAGE  1.0.0  (or  greater)  on  any  of:	 a  computer  of  your  own,  an 
Athena  machine,  a  math  department  machine.  Then  using  SAGE  and  the  previous 
exercises, ﬁnd a representation of the prime p = 1040+301 in the form a2+b2 .  Show your 
work:  that  is,  include  the  code  that you used  to obtain  the  representation.  Most  likely 
you want  to  do  this  by  just  printing  out  your  session.  (This  amounts  to  implementing 
the  Euclidean  algorithm  in  Z[i].  You may  want  to  warm  up  with  a  simpler  example!)
