Supplement:  addition  on  elliptic  curves 

Let  K  be  a  ﬁeld  and  let  K  be  an  algebraic  closure  of  K .  Then  any  homogeneous  poly­
nomial  P  ∈ K [x, y , z ]  deﬁnes  a  closed  subvariety  V (P )  of  the  pro jective  space  P3  .  Actually 
K 
it’s  a  closed  subscheme,  but  I’ll  often  assume  that  P  has  no  repeated  factors,  so  that  I  can 
neglect  this. 
I  say  P  is  nonsingular  at  a  point  [a  :  b  :  c]  ∈  V (P )  (the  a, b, c  being  homogeneous 
coordinates)  if  the  partial  derivatives  of  P  do  not  all  vanish  at  (x, y , z ) = (a, b, c).  Then  P 
has  a  unique  tangent  line  at  that  point. 
For  P, Q ∈ K [x, y , z ]  homogeneous  polynomials  with  no  factors  in  common,  I  deﬁne  the 
intersection  multiplicity  of  P, Q  at  a  point  [a  : b  : c] ∈ V (P ) ∩ V (Q)  to  be  the K ­dimension 
of  the  local  ring  of  the  scheme  V (P ) ∩ V (Q)  at  [a, b, c].  Concretely,  take  K [x, y , z ]/(P, Q), 
invert  any  homogeneous  polynomial  not  vanishing  at  [a, b, c],  then  pull  out  the  bit  of  degree 
zero. 
If  P  and  Q  are  both  nonsingular,  then  the  intersection  multiplicity  is  1.  If  only  P 
is  nonsingular,  then  the  intersection  multiplicity  is  the  order  of  vanishing  of  Q  along  the 
tangent  line  of  P . 
Theorem  1  (B´ezout)  Let  P, Q  ∈ K [x, y , z ]  be  homogeneous  polynomials  with  no  repeated 
factors and no factors in common.  Then the intersection multiplicities of al l points of V (P )∩
V (Q)  add  up  to  deg(P ) deg(Q). 
Let  P  ∈  K [x, y , z ]  be  a  polynomial  with  no  repeated  factors.  Let  Div(P )  be  the  free 
abelian  group  generated  by  V (P );  we  refer  to  elements  of  Div(P )  as  divisors  on  P  and 
deﬁne  the  degree  of  a  divisor  as  the  sum  of  its  coeﬃcients.  For  any  Q  ∈ K [x, y , z ]  with  no 
factor  in  common with P , write  (Q)  for  the  divisor  consisting  of  each  point  in  V (P ) ∩ V (Q) 
with  multiplicity  equal  to  the  intersection  multiplicity.  By  B´ezout,  this  divisor  has  degree 
deg(P ) deg(Q). 
Let  Div0 (P )  be  the  subgroup  of  Div(P )  consisting  of  divisors  of  degree  0.  Deﬁne  the 
Picard  group  Pic(P ) of P  (or better,  of  the algebraic  curve V (P ) over K )  to be  the quotient 
of Div0 (P ) by the subgroup generated by (Q1 )− (Q2 ) for all homogeneous polynomials Q1 , Q2 
of  the  same  degree. 
Now  suppose  P  has  degree  3  and  is  nonsingular  everywhere,  and  that  O  ∈  V (P )  is  a 
point  with  coeﬃcients  in  K .  The  pair  (V (P ), O)  is  an  example  of  an  el liptic  curve.  In  this 
case,  for  any  points  T , U  ∈ V (P ),  you  can  draw  a  line  through  T  and  U  which  hits  V (P )  in 
a  third  point  S ,  and  thus  get  a  relation  (S ) + (T ) + (U ) =  �,  where  �  is  the  divisor  of  any 
ﬁxed  line.  Consequence:  every  element  of  Pic(P )  can  be  represented  by  a  pair  (T ) − (O) 
for  some  T  ∈ V (P ).  Moreover,  this  T  is  unique:  that  amounts  to  saying  that  (T ) − (U )  can 
never  occur  as  the  divisor  of  a  polynomial.  That’s  a  little  exercise  in  the  theory  of  algebraic 
curves:  such  a  divisor  would  give  rise  to  an  isomorphism  between  V (P )  and  P1  ,  but  the 
K 
former  has  genus  1  and  the  latter  has  genus  0.  (Concretely:  there  is  a  rational  diﬀerential 
form  on  V (P )  with  no  poles  anywhere,  but  any  rational  diﬀerential  on  P1  has  two  more 
K 
poles  than  zeroes,  when  counting  with multiplicity.)

In  other words,  there  is  an  addition  law  for points  on V (P )!  Moreover,  you  can  compute 
this  law  as  follows:  given  two  points  T , U ,  take  the  third  intersection  S  of  the  line  through 
them  with  V (P ),  then  take  the  third  intersection  of  the  line  through  S  and  O  with  V (P ). 
In  particular, K ­rational  points  form  a  subgroup  under  addition. 
Aside:  the  uniqueness  argument  doesn’t  work  if  P  is  degree  3  but  singular,  but  you  can 
still  use  the  geometric  addition  law  on  nonsingular  points,  as  long  as O  itself  is  nonsingular: 
you  can  prove  the  associativity  by  degeneration  from  the  nonsingular  case.  (The  hangup 
with  a  singular  point  is  that  a  line  through  it  always  has  intersection  multiplicity  greater 
than  1 with  V (P ).)  But  in  this  case  you  can  sometimes  identify  the  result more  simply;  see 
exercises. 
For  more,  see  Silverman,  The  Arithmetic  of  El liptic  Curves.  I  may  have  more  to  say  on 
this  topic  later. 
Exercise  (not  to  be  turned  in): 

1.  Let	 P  =  x3  +  y z  and  let  O  =  [0  :  1  :  0].  Give  an  isomorphism  of  the  group  of 
2
nonsingular  points  of  V (P )  with  the  additive  group  of K . 

2.  Let  P  =  x3  + x z + y 2z  and  let  O  =  [0  :  1  :  0].  Give  an  isomorphism  of  the  group  of 
2
nonsingular  points  of  V (P )  with  the multiplicative  group  of K .
