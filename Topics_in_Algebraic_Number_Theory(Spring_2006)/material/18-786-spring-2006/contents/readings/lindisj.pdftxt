18.786  supplement:  linear  disjointness


Let  me  try  to  alleviate  a  bit  of  the  confusion  about  the  concept  of  linear  disjointness 
(thanks to Dani Kane  for helping straighten some of this out).  This corrects some assertions 
from  the March  14  lecture. 
Let  L1 , L2  be  ﬁnite  extensions  of  a  ﬁeld  K .  We  say  that  L1  and  L2  are  linearly  disjoint 
if  the  K ­algebra  L1  ⊗K  L2  is  a  ﬁeld  (note  that  it  is  enough  for  it  to  be  an  integral  domain, 
since we proved in class that any integral domain which is integral over a ﬁeld is also a ﬁeld). 
If  so,  it  is  then  isomorphic  to  the  compositum L1L2  within  any  overﬁeld L3  containing  both 
1  and  L2  (because  the  multiplication  map  from  L1  ⊗K  L2  to  L3  will  be  injective  and  its 
L
image  will  be  a  ﬁeld  containing  both  L1  and  L2 ,  so  L1L2  can  be  no  larger). 
It  is  not  true  in  general  that  just  knowing  that  L1  ∩ L2  = K  inside  some  overﬁeld  L3  is 
enough to say that L1  and L2  are  linearly disjoint.  (For  instance,  look at two diﬀerent copies 
of Q[x]/(x − 2)  inside  C;  their  compositum  has  degree  6,  not  9,  over Q.)

However,  if  L1  and  L2  are  Galois  over  K ,  then  it  is  true  that  the  equality  L1  ∩ L2  = K 
in  any  overﬁeld  implies  that  L1  and  L2  are  linearly  disjoint.  Proof:  we  ﬁrst  check  that  the 
compositum  of  two  Galois  extensions  is  Galois  (without  any  extra  hypothesis).  Let  L3  be 
the  compositum  in  some  overﬁeld.  Since  L1/K  is  separable,  it  is  generated  by  a  root  of 
a  separable  polynomial;  that  root  also  generates  L3  over  L2 ,  so  L3/L2  is  separable.  Since 
L3/L2  and  L2/K  are  separable,  so  is  L3/K .  Since  L1  and  L2  are  Galois,  they  are  normal: 
they  are  splitting  ﬁelds  for  some  polynomials  P1  and  P2  over K .  Then L3  is  a  splitting  ﬁeld 
for  P1P2 ,  so  it  is  also  normal  over K .  Since  L3/K  is  normal  and  separable,  it  is Galois  (but 
this,  or  more  precisely  the  fact  that  normal  plus  separable  implies  that  the  automorphism 
group  is  as  big  as  the  extension  degree,  is  nontrivial Galois  theory!). 
Put  Gi  =  Gal(Li/K );  then  G3  surjects  onto  G1  and  G2  via  the  Galois  correspondence. 
Let  Hi  be  the  kernel  of  G3  → Gi  for  i = 1, 2;  then  H1  ∩ H2  ﬁxes  both  L1  and  L2 ,  and  since 
3  is  the  compositum  of  those, H1  ∩ H2  must  ﬁx  L3 .  Hence H1  ∩ H2  = {e}.

Finally,  the hypothesis L1 ∩ L2  = K  implies,  via  the Galois  correspondence,  that  there  is 
no  normal  subgroup  of  G3  containing  both  H1  and  H2 ;  that  is,  H1H2  = G3 .  We  have  maps 
3  → G1  and G3  → G2  giving  a map G3  → G1  × G2 ;  by  elementary  group  theory,  this map 
G
must  now  be  an  isomorphism.  In  particular,  [L3  :  K ] = [L1  :  K ][L2  :  K ],  so  the  surjection 
1  ⊗K  L2  → L3  must  be  an  isomorphism.
