“An essay is good   
1. 
If most readers could not convincingly answer the question (your topic asks) after reading the 
work once (i.e., the topic should be thought-provoking). 
if your topic is meaningful (worth considering—i.e., will the answer, your essay, enhance 
your readers’ understanding of the work?). 
if the topic is focused narrowly enough to develop your answer in depth within your  space 
limitations.  For example, “Comedy in Romeo and Juliet” is too broad for a typical essay 
(900-3000 words), whereas “The Nurse as a Comic figure” would be more specific and 
manageable.” --“Writing about Literature,” the Writing and Communication Center. 

 
Close reading is the analysis of passages from in terms of diction, figurative 
 
language (metaphors, similes, names, etc.), tone, characterization, strategies of narration, 
plot, topics, “place” of the passage in the text as a whole, and theme.  Like any kind of 
analysis, closer reading examines the ways that the parts of a text (in this case, parts of a 
passage) work separately and together to contribute to the text as a whole.  Note that 
analysis differs from summary in answering the “why?” and “so what?” question, while 
summary answers questions about “who?” “what?” “when?” and “where?”  In examining 
passages, aim to explain the significance of a passage, not just the meaning.  For 
example, “Bingley says that he did not know that Elizabeth was a ‘studier of character’ 
(38),” remains plot summary:  it tells what happened, stating who said what.  In contrast, 
the following sentence and paragraph analyze the statement by explaining its significance 
in the novel as a whole: 
 

            

Choose a passage that enables you to explain and explore what you like or dislike.   
            Imagine explaining your interest in the passage to a friend; try outlining, talking,  
or ordering index cards.   If you choose two or more passages, write about them  

   When Bingley calls Elizabeth a “studier of character” (58), he names one of the 
major activities and concerns in the novel:  evaluating people.  While the book opens 
with an evaluation of Mr. Bingley in terms of his marital status, sex, and money, 
Elizabeth focuses on deeper qualities. When Bingley says that it “must be an amusing 
study,” his language emphasizes that Elizabeth needs to entertain herself in a small 
community with somewhat limited diversions.  The word, “study,” however, under-
scores the importance that both Elizabeth and the narrator give to this activity.  In 
fact, the novel’s title includes two character traits that play important roles in the 
story, so Bingley’s quick response holds much more significance than first appears. 

 
 

     The topic of “intricate characters” provides an opening for not only Bingley and Elizabeth  
but also Darcy and Mrs. Bennet to reveal more about their characters. . . . 

 
 
TIPS:  Write this (and any) paper in stages:  pre-writing, drafting, revising, and editing.   
 
Pre-writing:    First, sit with your text, notes, and ideas about the book or story.   
Consider the parts of the text that you like, dislike, or have questions about.   
Topics that catch your imagination will prove more interesting to you and  
probably to readers.  (If you don’t get excited about the paper, why should  
anyone else?) 

individually and collectively. 

Formulate a tentative organizing idea or (hypo)thesis about the passage’s  
significance. 

Remember to adjust the thesis to fit the data, or choose passages that fit the thesis. 
Almost inevitably, you will need to tailor the thesis beyond its initial form; do so. 
The point of examining the data is to discover what it reveals; use the revelations. 
The original elements and the fruitfulness of your thesis & paper give them value,  
so a thesis and paper that discover connections, cogently explain the author’s  
choices, find significance in techniques, or reveal hidden patterns have value. 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 
Drafting:  Write in any way that accumulates ideas to convey your thoughts to readers: 
Freewrite in phrases or sentences and fix later; write in sentences, outline; 
 
organize notecards or other pieces of evidence; use an idea “tree” or balloon, etc.  
Consult friends or a person in class about a paper’s clarity. 

 
 
Writing the introduction:  Write the clearest introduction and thesis statement (main  
idea) that you can, but realize that the best introduction usually gets written after  
you write the end of at least one draft.  That way, you’ve realized what you want  
to say. 

 
           Later, steal a clear statement of your main idea from the conclusion; state that idea  
as the thesis in the introduction to catch and focus readers’ attention and begin  
the argument (argue a controversial, un-obvious idea).   
 
Try to forecast, or signal, the paper’s general organization.  Example:   
    “Bingley’s offhand comment to Elizabeth reveals a similarity between her and  
    Darcy and identifies a topic to which all the characters respond in important  
    ways.   Further, it refers to one of the narrator’s concerns: … .” 
   This suggests a general organization that moves from A (E and D’s similar trait  
    of studying character) to B (other characters’ interest in character), and finally  
    to C (use of point of view, theme, and other narratorial/narrative techniques). 
 
“Warm-up” introductions:  Many writers begin with a “throat-clearing” or universal  
statement,  which is fine if it helps you begin; later, after your conclusion arrives  
at your main idea, cut the “warm-up.”  Readers  (and papers) benefit more from 
an immediate focus on the paper topic (here, the significance of the passage/s).  
Instead of stating, “Judging character should concern anyone considering 
marriage,” begin with a comment about the novel or short story and locate the 
passage within that context.  Do you love to make or refer to universal claims?-- 
limit yourself to one or two general statements instead of a paragraph of them. 
 
In the conclusion, you may feel tempted to use generalization; remember that fully ex- 
ploring the passages, themes, and techniques in the texts will be more convincing.   

Revising and editing will receive attention in future handouts.  For now, use the skills  
you have learned to make your introduction and conclusion as clear, specific, and  
forceful as you can.  For example, revise a phrase like, “for the reasons above, the 
passage in Pride and Prejudice  contributes significantly to revealing Mr. Bennet’s  
character” by naming or at least characterizing “the reasons above.”   

 
***Resist any impulse to make general claims beyond the novel.
