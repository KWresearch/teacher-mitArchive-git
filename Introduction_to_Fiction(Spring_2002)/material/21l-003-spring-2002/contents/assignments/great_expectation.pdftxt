21L.003-Eiland   More Suggestions for Writing about Passages of Fiction   E. Fox 
 
 
In the first paper, most of you focused well on a passage. For the second paper, 
you will interpret another passage, this time from Great Expectations (note:  titles of 
novels are italicized; those of short stories are set off by double quotation marks:  “Joy”).  
Choose a passage that appeals to you, puzzles you, suggests themes that interest you, or 
presents characters that annoy you—anything that captures your interest will make the 
paper more rewarding to you and readers.  Let us assume that you choose the opening 
passage from the novel. 
 
Reminder:  Analysis (whether of a molecule, bridge, budget, fugue, or formula) 
considers the contribution of parts to a whole.  Good analyses examine the contributions 
of many parts in many ways and unify the contributions in a thesis.  In evaluating the 
significance of one or more paragraphs, your reading should consider words, phrases, 
imagery, sentences, dialogue, characters, actions, tone, themes, the continuum between 
documentary realism and “the fabular” or fairy tale, dream, romance, etc..  To construct a 
thesis or organizing idea, comb over these elements to gather ideas about the significance 
of the passage:  its appeal for you, the ways it opens up important ideas in the book, ideas 
other readers can gain from your interpretation of it, or, most generally, the ways in 
which it matters.  Use this list of tips to compile your information about the passage. 
 
First:  As you analyze or “read closely,” stay focused on the passage, not links to themes 
outside the novel or even in the novel, if discussed only in general terms.  Characterize 
the nitty-gritty specifics of the passage that give it a distinctive texture, flavor, mood, 
power, and significance.  To succeed with this, you will probably begin with some idea(s) 
about the passage.   Comb and sift through the passage for as much evidence as possible 
BEFORE starting to write.  This stage of close reading leads you to discover ways that 
parts of the passage contribute to, extend, refine, and support your thesis.  We will 
practice this in individual conferences as we go over the separate words in the passage.  
Sometimes the difference between “a” and “the” matters and contributes to a witty, 
ironic, poignant, or other tone.   
 

Some points to consider in close- (or closely) reading a passage: 
 
Location in the text:  While this may seem obvious, especially for the opening passage, 
the location often provides an occasion for the author (and you) to mark important events 
and themes.  If the passage occurs at the beginning or end of a text, chapter, or section of 
the book, it carries extra significance, so note what that is.   
 

For example, the opening of G. E. presents the narrator in a sentence giving his 
family or last name, his first name, and his nickname.  Thinking about just this sentence 
and its elements, you may realize that the emphasis on naming occurs not only in the 
repetition of names (Pip’s names appear repeatedly) but also in the echoes among those 
names (Pirrup, Philip, Pip), and in the coincidence of what he “called [him]self” and what 
he “came to be called.”  An emphasis on names suits an introduction but also highlights 

concerns about identity, a theme of the novel.  Ask what the significance of key locations 
could be; what content or theme does the passage’s location emphasize, and why? 
Diction:  Consider (and comment on) connotations as well as denotations.  Certain words, 
i.e., “property,” “possession,” and “relinquish,” suggest the business or legal professions; 
“heart,” “tears,” and “fond farewell” or “forgive,” however, come from a more emotional 
and psychological register (category or level) of language.  Dictionaries will help here. 
 
Patterns of words, phrases, objects, etc.:  Note repetitions, parallels, and other similarities 
of wording, events, imagery, and themes.  Examples include mentions of moisture, the 
sea, the wind, circles of light, perhaps light and dark in general, hearts, and forgiveness. 
 
Figurative language:   Note metaphors (comparison on the basis of a common trait, i.e., 
“stone lozenges” and little brothers “on their backs with their hands in their trousers- 
pockets”) and similes (metaphors using “like” or “as”:  “my love is like a red, red rose”).  
Discuss the combination of tombstones and little workers, being born in trousers, “signs” 
of death and money.  Consider the image of children “who gave up trying to get a living . 
. . early in the universal struggle” and effects on our “expectations” for the novel. 
 
Setting:  The location, time, landscape, interior décor, and atmosphere can all contribute 
to the significance of a passage.  For instance, the opening passage refers to the outdoors 
and moves from the focus on tombstones to the marshes out to the sea and back to Pip. 
 
Events in the passage:  Consider the actions that occur within, before, and just after the 
passage.  If the characters engage in actions described in the passage, name their 
significance:  are they routine, characteristic, out of character, reminiscent of some other 
character or event, or otherwise noteworthy?  The events may contribute to the tone of 
the passage or the characters’ emotions and may dictate the kinds of topics in the passage 
or the level and associations of the words in the passage—see more under Diction.  
 
In our example, nothing precedes the passage.  That might seem obvious and not 
worth noting.  If we note that point, however, we may notice that Pip’s family actually 
“precedes” him, so the description of his family (and its absence, paralleled by the 
absence of any preceding passage) suits the second paragraph’s meditation on family.   
Thinking more about this, we might conclude that death precedes Pip—not a cheery 
thought, but perhaps relevant and worth putting in our collection of observations on the 
opening.  We might jot down a question—what significance does death hold in the 
novel?  This might constitute a tentative organizing idea:  the opening emphasizes death 
or links identity and death. 
 
Characters in the passage:  If your passage features one or more characters, you should 
probably state the significance of those characters to each other.  State whether the 
character(s) is (are) major or minor and any significance of their appearance together.  Is 
one a double or opposite of the other?  a father, mother, or sibling figure?  opposite or 
similar in terms of class, background, family position, appearance, aspirations, profession 
or training, dress, etc.?  If the two parallel or oppose each other, connect this point with 
their roles elsewhere in the text, especially if some key action links them.   

 

We might notice that Pip appears alone. Remembering discussion, we realize that 
his older self describes his younger self, so even alone Pip bears a relation to himself; we 
might label this retrospection or note the meditative mood.  The fact that Pip appears 
among tombstones relates him to his family in a sad way; this might suggest that his 
family relations mix the uncomfortable or awkward formality of calling his sister “Mrs. 
Joe Gargery” instead of her first name and the sadness of using no proper name for his 
parents and siblings.  Instead of mentioning any closeness to his family, the passage gives 
the full names for Pip and Joe, suggesting Pip’s relative isolation or loss of family and his 
close connection with Joe.  We might revise the tentative main idea to include a mention 
of connection beyond death:  “The opening emphasizes lost family relations, ties beyond 
death, and risks in family life as much as it emphasizes Pip’s identity.”   
Or, 
“The opening introduces Pip and his identity as tied to a lost family, focused on 
loss and death, and concerned with origins.”  (Other ideas might interest you more.) 
 
Progress or movement within the passage.  Notice the sequence of ideas within the 
passage; this might lead to a point about the linking themes, the concerns of the narrator 
or the characters and events described, the tone of the passage, and themes of the text. 
Mentioning the order and juxtaposition of “meta-”(or general) topics is another way to 
discuss a passage; it might mix legal, business, and emotional ideas in one sentence. 
 

For instance, our passage introduces the narrator by name, moves to a paragraph 
about his (mostly dead) family, in a third paragraph broadens the focus to the landscape, 
and returns to locate the narrator within that landscape.  We discussed the significance of 
the movement in several ways:  as a widening view that emphasizes Pip’s smallness and 
youth; as a way of locating and cataloguing elements (relationships, esp. familial ones, 
the marshes, “impressions[s] of the identity of things” (page 3) that will gather 
significance as the plot progresses); as a philosophical, metaphysical, or almost spiritual 
mapping of the themes of names, positions into which characters are born, inscriptions 
such as names and labels, etc. 
 
The continuum between documentary realism and the fabular or fairy tale conventions:  
Recalling the diagram and discussion from the first day of class, place the passage on one 
or more points between the “truths” of empirical perception and of dream-like representa-
tions of wishes, the unconscious, and internal realities.  
 
Using Quotations:   Introduce and explain quotations instead of dropping them into your 
paragraph and relying on a reader’s intuition.  Put double quotation (“Hi!”) marks around 
quotations up to three lines long.  Longer quotations belong in block form, indented one 
inch on the left-hand margin, without quotation marks. Put page # inside parentheses: (1). 
MLA-style page references follow quotation marks and precede the period or other mark.
