Name & Recitation  Section:

Due Friday, Jan 7 at 3 PM in 32-044.  Please print out your code ﬁles (homework  2.py, nims.py, strings  and  lists.py,

and  any  code  you wrote  for  optional  problems),  and  staple  them  to  the  back  of  these  exercises  before  turning  them

in.


Warm  up  –  Recollections 

Recall  that  a  string  is  immutable,  while  a  list  is  mutable.  What  does  this mean? 

Exercise  2.11  –  String  Operations 

String  operators  might  be  a  little  less  intuitive  than  those  on  numbers.  This  exercise  will  give  you  a  chance  to 
practice  those.  Given  the  following  variables: 

look  =  ’Look  at  me!’ 
now  =  ’  NOW’ 

What  are  the  values  of  the  following  expressions?  Try  to  guess  on  your  own  before  using  your  interpreter  (but  feel 
free  to  use  your  interpreter  once  you  get  stuck). 

1.  look[:4] 

2.  look[-1] 

3.  look*2 

4.  look[:-1]  +  now  +  look[-1] 

5.  now[1] 

6.  now[4] 

7.  look*2  +  look[:-1]  +  now  +  look[-1]

2.12  –  List  Operations 

For the following, write the line(s) of code that will emit the given Output.  For each problem there may be more than 
one correct answer; just give one.  More on lists:  http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.6/tutorial/datastructures.html
