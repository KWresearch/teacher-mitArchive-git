6.189  IAP  2011:  Optional  Recursion  Exercises 

These exercises are optional, have fun playing around with them.  Solutions will be posted to the website on Tuesday; 
feel  free  to  ask  questions  about  these  problems  on  the  staﬀ  email  list,  or  at  oﬃce  hours. 

For  all  these  problems,  be  sure  to  carefully  consider  your  base  and  recursive  cases  carefully! 

1.  Write  a  function  that  takes  in  two  numbers  and  recursively multiplies  them  together. 

2.  Write  a  function  that  takes  in  a  base  and  an  exp  and  recursively  computes  baseexp .  You  are  not  al lowed  to 
use  the  **  operator! 

3.  Write  a  function  using  recursion  to  print  numbers  from  n  to  0. 

4.  Write a function using recursion to print numbers from 0 to n (you just need to change one line in the program 
of  problem  1). 

5.  Write  a  function  using  recursion  that  takes  in  a  string  and  returns  a  reversed  copy  of  the  string. 	 The  only 
string  operation  you  are  allowed  to  use  is  string  concatenation. 

6.  Write  a  function  using  recursion  to  check  if  a  number  n  is  prime  (you  have  to  check  whether  n  is  divisible  by 
any  number  below  n). 

7.  Write  a  recursive  function  that  takes  in  one  argument  n  and  computes  Fn ,  the  nth  value  of  the  Fibonacci 
sequence.  Recall  that  the  Fibonacci  sequence  is  deﬁned  by  the  relation 

where


Fn  = Fn−1  + Fn−2 

F0  = 0  and  F1  = 1


Visit  the Wikipedia  page  on  the  Fibonacci  Number  for more  information  if  you’re  still  confused.
