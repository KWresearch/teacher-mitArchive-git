How  To  Properly  Comment  Your  Code 
Uncommented  Code  The  6.189  staﬀ  received  this  code  to  grade. 

There’s  a  bunch  of  problems  with  it.  A  quick  scan  of  it  reveals  no  info  as  to  which  of  our  250  students  wrote  this 
code.  What  is  the  name  of  the  ﬁle?  What  does  it  do?  At  a  glance,  we  are  lost.  This  code  would  receive  a  grade  of 
a �. 
Commented  Code  The  staﬀ  next  received  this  ﬁle. 

We  can  clearly  see  Alyssa’s  name  and  the  name  of  her  ﬁle.  Further  she  has  well-commented  what  the  lines  of  her 
program  do.  This  code  would  receive  a  grade  of  +.  You  should  be  like  Alyssa!  You  should  comment  wherever 
you  can  - put  comments  that  explain  what  you’re  doing,  and  if  you’re  doing  something  tricky  or  unique  be  sure  to 
explain  that,  as  well.  A  good  goal  is  to  have  1  comment  for  every  1-4  lines  of  code.  Be  sure  to  not  only  document 
what your code is doing, but, as you begin writing more advanced code, you should document what was intentionally 
left  out,  optimized  away,  tried  and  discarded,  etc  - basically,  any  design  decision  you  make.
