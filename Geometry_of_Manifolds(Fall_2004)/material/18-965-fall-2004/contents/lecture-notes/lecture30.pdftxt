21.2  The Frobenious Integrability Theorem 

Next we consider when can a subbundle ξ  of the tangent bundle T M  of M  can be 
brought  into  a  canonical  form.  In  generality  this  is  a  very  complicated  problem 
and we need to isolate manageable cases.  The example that comes to mind is the 
case where �0 |(x , y )  =  Tx Rn  × {0} ⊂  Tx Rn  × Tx Rm−n , the tangent bundle along 
a product. A subbundle which is locally diffeomorphic to �0  is called integrable.

is  also  a  local  section  of �.  A  subbundle with  this  property  is  called  involutive.

Clearly any integrable subbundle is involutive.

is not  involutive.  In fact  in has  the  interesting property  that given any  two points 
and any path connected neighborhood there is a path tangent to �2  joining the two 
points contained in the neighborhood. Clearly then �2  is not integrable. 
The following provides a converse. 

Theorem 21.4.  (Frobenius).  If � is involutive then it is integrable. 
Proof.  Choose ﬁrst  a coordinate patch about of the from φ  : U  → Rn  × Rm−n  so 
that at φ (m ) = 0 and φ∗ (ξm ) = T0Rn  × {0}.  Set �1  = φ∗ (�). 
Then  in  some  neighborhood  V  ×  W  of  φ (m )  =  0  we  can  ﬁnd  a  function 
f  : V × W × Rn  → Rm−n , linear in the last factor with  f (0, 0, ·) = 0 and so that 
any ξ  ∈ � can uniquely be written as 
ξ  = (e,  f (x , y , e). 

There is a natural homotopy of �0  to �1  given by 
�t  = {(e, t f (t x , y , e)|e ∈ Rn }. 
We will show that there is a one parameter family of diffeomorphisms  Ft  so that 
1.  Ft (0) = 0 and 
2.  ( Ft )∗ ( X t ) = �0 . 
Thus  F1  is the desired change of coordinates.  For x  ∈ V  let 
X x (v , w) = (x ,  f (v , w, x )) 
Then  the  fact  the  �1  is  involutive  implies  that  [ X x , X y ]  ∈  �1  but  [ X x , X y ]  is 
certainly of the form (O , ∗) since the constant vectors  ﬁelds  x  and  y  commute so 
� 
� 
[ X x , X y ] = 0. More explicitly 
[ X x , X y ] =  0, D(v ,w,x )  f ( y ,  f (v , w, y ), 0) − D(v ,w, y )  f (x ,  f (v , w, x ), 0)  = 0 

55


Let X t (v , w) = (0,  f (t v , w, v )). A typical section of �t  is X t ,x (u , v ) = (x , t f (t v , w, x )). 
� 
We can work out the bracket [ X t , X t ,x ] 
� 
[ X t , X t ,x ]  =  0, t D(t v ,w,x )  f (0,  f (t v , w, v ), 0)

the  time  dependent  vector  ﬁeld 

Here is a more intuitive proof by induction on the dimension. 

Proof.  Induction on  the dimension of  the subbundle.  The case of dimension one 
follows  from  the  standard  form  for  an  non­vanishing  vector  ﬁeld.  The  question 
is  also  local  so  we  assume  that  we  are  given  a  subbundle  of  the  tangent  bundle 
in  a neighborhood of 0  ∈  Rn .  Suppose we have proved  the  result 
of Rn  deﬁned 
for  all  subbundles  of  dimension  d .  Let  E  be  an  involutive  subbundle  of  T Rn  of 
dimension d + 1. Choose a nowhere vanishing local section, X , of E . Next choose 
∂ z n  = 
X .  T Rn−1  × {0}  is
a coordinate system  z 1 , . . . , z n  ,  centered at 0,  so  that  ∂ 
an  integrable  hence  involutive  subbundle.  E � =  E  ∩  T Rn−1  × {0}  deﬁnes  a 
subbundle in a neighborhood of 0 of dimension d .  Since  E �  is the intersection of 
two involutive subbundles it is involutive and so the induction hypothesis applies. 
We can  ﬁnd  a coordinate system  y 1 , . . . , y n  centered at 0 so that  E �  is given in a 
neighborhood of 0 as the span of y 1 , . . . , y d  In this new coordinate system X may 
not be straight but we have that

21.3	 Foliations 

The  local  structure  of  the  previous  subsection  has  as  its  global  counterpart  the 
notion of a foliation. Here is the precise deﬁnition. 
� 
Deﬁnition  21.5.  A foliation F  of M  is a decomposition of M  as a disjoint union 
of  connected  immersed  submanifolds  M  = 
α∈ A Lα  called  the  leaves  of  F  so 
� 
from  the  decomposition �  α∈ A Lα  ∩ U  by  taking  components  goes  over  to  the 
that  each  point  has  a  chart  (U , φ )  so  that  under  φ  the  decomposition  obtained 
decomposition of Rn  = 
x ∈Rn−k  Rk  × x . 
It  is  important  to  realize  that  in  the  above  deﬁnition  we  do  not  require  the 
leaves to have the subspace topology.  For example Consider the 2­torus 
T 2  = R2/Z2 

Fix  a  pair  of  real  numbers  (ζ1 , ζ2 )  so  that  ζ1/ζ2  is  irrational.  The  cosets  of  the 
subgroup � generated by {[t ζ1 , t ζ2 ]|t  ∈ R} give rise to a foliation with leaves that 
are not locally closed subsets. 
Remark  6.  The  space  of  leaves  of  a  foliation  is  one  setting where  one  runs  into 
non­Hausdorff  manifolds.  The  space  of  leaves  has  a  natural  covering  by  charts 
(These may not be injective so be careful). 

22	 Characterizing a codimension one foliation in terms 
of its normal vector. 
Let F  be a two dimensional foliation of R3 . 
Proposition 22.1.  Let n be a local normal vector ﬁeld to  F .  Then 
n · (� × n) = 0

23  The holonomy of closed loop in a leaf 
Deﬁnition  23.1.  Let  F  be  a  foliation  of  a  manifold  M .  A  transversal  to  F  is 
smooth  locally closed submanifold of  M  which meets all  leaves  transversally.  A 
local transversal is a transversal which is diffeomorphic to a disk. 

59 

To discuss the holonomy we will use the terminology of a germs. 
Deﬁnition  23.2.  Let  X , Y  be  smooth manifolds.  Fix  a  point  x  ∈  X .  A  germ  of 
smooth mappings  at  x  is  the  equivalence  class  of  functions  f  :  U  →  Y  where 
U  ⊂  X  is an open neighborhood of x  under the equivalence relation of agreement 
upon  restriction.  That  is  f  :  U  →  Y  is  equivalent  to  g  :  V  →  Y  if  there  is  a 
neighborhood W  of x  so that  f |W  = g |W . 
Let τ1  and τ2  be local transversals hitting the same leaf L of F .  τ1  and τ2  are 
both contained in the same foliation chart U . Then the chart deﬁnes  the germ of a 
diffeomorphism from τ1  at τ1  ∩ L to τ2  at τ2  ∩ L
Let γ :  S 1  → L be a C 1  closed loop based at x  in a leaf L of foliation F .  Let 
τ  be a transversal to F  passing through x . 

24  Reeb’s stability theorem 

Deﬁnition  24.1.  A codimension one foliation is called transversally orientable if 
the normal bundle ν  = T M / T F  is orientable. 

Theorem 24.2.  Let F  be a normally oriented two dimensional foliation of a com­
pact  oriented  three  manifold.  If  F  contains  S 2  as  a  closed  leave  then  the  pair 
M , F  is diffeomorphic to  S 2 × S 1  with the product foliation by two­spheres.. 

Remark  7.  To  see  that  the  normally  oriented  condition  is  important  in  the  state­
ment of the result note the following.  S 2 × S 1  has an orientation preserving invo­
lution τ  :  S 2 × S 1  →  S 2 × S 1  given by 
τ (x , ei θ ) = (−x , e
−i θ ). 
This  is  a  ﬁxed  point  free  involution  so  the  quotient  X  =  S 2  ×  S 1/(x , e )  ∼ 
i θ
(−x , e−i θ ) has the structure of manifold as well.  The product foliation is of  S 2 × 
S 1  is carried to itself by τ  and descends to a foliation of  X . The induced foliation 
is not normally oriented (can you see this).  Most of the leaves are two sphere but 
there are two leaves which are real projective planes. 
Lemma  24.3.  Let  φ  :  D 2  →  M  be  an  smooth  embedding  of  D 2  into  M 3  with 
image  contained  in  a  leaf  L  of  F .  Then  there  is  a  foliating  coordinate  patch 
φ˜ :  D 2 × (−�, � ) →  M 3  extending φ . 

60


Proof.  First of all  it  is straightforward  to construct a coordinate patch ψ  :  D 2  × 
(−a , a ) → M  extending φ so that F  is transverse to all the ψ ({x } × (−a , a )) and 
so T F  agrees with D(0,t )ψ (T0 D 2 × {0}). Transfer F  to a foliation of D 2 × (−a , a ) 
still called F . Let (r, θ ) be polar coordinates in the disk. 
Deﬁne G  on ( D 2 \ {0}) × (−a , a ) to be the span of  ∂  and  ∂
∂ 
t . By construction 
G  is transverse to F  and so the intersection T F  ∩ G  deﬁnes  a line  ﬁeld  on ( D 2  \ 
∂ r 
{0}) × (−a , a ). This line ﬁeld  is spanned by a vector ﬁeld  of the form v (r, θ , t ) = 
+ a (r, θ , t ) ∂  . We have a (r, θ , 0) = 0 and a (0, θ , t ) = 0.  and let Fs  denote the 
∂ 
time  s  ﬂow  of  v .  Fs (r, θ , t )  = (r  + s , θ , Ts (r, θ , t )) when  it  is  deﬁned.  Choose 
∂ r 
∂ t 
b  small  enough  so  that  the  time  1­ﬂow  of  v  with  initial  conditions  (0, θ , t )  for 
|t |  <  b  is  deﬁned.  Deﬁne  a  map  φ˜ :  D 2  × (−b, b)  →  D 2  \ {0}) × (−a , a ) 
by  sending  (r, θ , t )  to  the  point  (r, θ , Tr (0, θ , t ))  or  in  words  the  time  r  ﬂow  of 
(0, θ , t ) under v .  This map takes the line segment {(r, θ , t )|0  ≤ r  <  1} to a leaf. 
Since  for  any  θ  v (0, θ , t )  =  ∂ r  is  tangent  to F ,  φ˜ carries  D 2  × {t } onto  a  leaf. 
∂
Thus φ˜ is the required map. 
Next we prove that in a neighborhood of a two­sphere leaf the foliation has a 
product structure. 
Lemma  24.4.  Suppose  that  L  is  a  leaf  of  F  which  diffeomorphic  to  S 2  The  is 
a  saturated neighborhood  N  of L which diffeomorphic  to  S 2  × (−a , a ) with  the 
product foliation. 
Proof.  Decompose S 2  = D 2 
+ ∪ D 2 
− . By the previous lemma we can ﬁnd  standard 
neighborhoods and glue them together to get the result. 

Next we will show that the set of points on a leaf diffeomorphic to  S 2  is both 
open and closed. 
Theorem  24.5.  Let F  be  a  transversally  oriented  foliation.  Then  there  is  a  em­
bedding  γ  :  S 1  →  M  transverse  to  the  leaves.  In  fact  γ  can  be  chosen  to  pass 
through any point of M 

Remark 8.  This is not to say that the image of γ  hits all the leaves. This is a much 
stronger condition. A foliation with this addition property is called taut. The Reeb 
foliation of S 3  is an example of a non­taut foliation. Any ﬂow  line can only touch 
the  torus  leaf  once  but  a  closed  circle  transverse  to  a  torus  in  S 3  must  meet  the 
torus in an even number of points. 

61 

Proof.  Fix a point  x0  ∈  M .  Since F  is  transversally oriented  there  is a nowhere 
vanishing vector ﬁeld,  v , which is transverse to the leaves. Let Ft  denote the time­
t  ﬂow  for  this  vector  ﬁeld  and  consider  a  particular  ﬂow 
line,  γ ,  of  this  vector 
ﬁeld. 
If  this  ﬂow 
line  is  a  periodic  orbit we  are  done  so  suppose  it  is  not.  Then 
we claim  that  there  is  leaf  that  is hit  inﬁnitely  often by  the  ﬂowline.  We can  ﬁnd 
x  ∈  X  and  sequence  ti  →  ∞  so  that  limi →∞  Fti 
(x0 )  =  x .  Let U  be  a  foliation 
chart  in  M  about  x .  We  can  construct  a  smaller  chart,  V ,  about  x  by  using  the 
vector  ﬁeld  v  to  ﬂow  away  from  the  leaf L  containing  x .  In  V  if  a point  is on  a 
line  in  V  it  hits L.  Since  inﬁnitely 
connected  component  of  the  part  of  the  ﬂow 
many points of γ  in different components of γ  ∩ V  are contained in V  the claim 
follows. 
Thus we can  ﬁnd  a piece of orbit which contains  x0  and hits some  leaf  twice 
and the points of intersection are contained in the patch V .  It is straightforward to 
modify the piece of ﬂow line in this patch to close it up. 
Now  consider  our  transversally  oriented  foliation  of  M 3  containing  a  leaf  L
diffeomorphic to S 2 . Let γ  be a closed transverse curve passing through L. Let � 
denote the union of all the leaves which pass through � . We claim that �  is all of 
M  and that γ  hits each leaf the same number of times. 
By  Lemma  24.4  �  is  open.  Also  by  this  lemma  there  for  each  point  y  of  γ 
there  is  a  compact  foliated  neighborhood  diffeomorphic  to  S 2  ×  [0, 1].  By  the 
compactness  of  γ  ﬁnitely  many  such  neighborhoods  cover  γ  but  then  �  is  the 
union of ﬁnitely  many closed sets and hence closed.  Finally consider the function 
which associates to each point y of γ  the of points of γ  contained in the same leaf 
as  y . By Lemma 24.4 this is a continuous function and hence is constant. 
Finally choose a new γ  which hits L once and hence all leaves once. Then 
h  : L × γ  →  M 
given by  taking  y  ∈  L and  t  ∈  γ  to  the unique point  in  the  leaf  through  t  hit by 
the ﬂow line of v 
through  y  is the required diffeomorphism.
