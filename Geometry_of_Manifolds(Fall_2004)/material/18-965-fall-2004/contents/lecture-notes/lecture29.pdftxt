21.1  The Lie Derivative 

Let  M  be a vector  ﬁeld  on a manifold  M .  As we say  the vector  ﬁeld  generates a 
ﬂow  Ft  :  M  →  M  at least locally in M  characterized by the condition that for all 
x  ∈  M  we have 

Ft (x ) =  X ( Ft (x ))
d 
d t 
Remark  5.  Or  in words  the  tangent  vector  to  the  curve  deﬁned  by  t  →  Ft (x )  at

t  = 0 is  X (x ).

Using  the  ﬂow  we can differentiate objects on  M .  For example given a  function

f	 :  M  → R we can compute 

d 
d t 
Lemma 21.1.  d t  f  ◦ Ft (x )|t =0  =  Dx  f ( X (x )). 
d

f  ◦ Ft (x ).

Proof.  This follows from remark 5. 

We will often write  X f (x ) for any of these expressions. 
For vector  ﬁeld  we can do the same.  Here we need to be a little careful about 
conventions.  Suppose  that  X , Y  are  vector  ﬁelds  on  X .  Then we  can  form  their 
bracket [ X , Y ]. Here it is easiest to think in terms of the action on functions.  If  f 
is a C 2  function then we deﬁne. 
[ X , Y ]( f ) =  X (Y f ) − Y ( X f )

The remaining terms dropping out since mixed partials commute. 
A little more invariantly in term of a patch we have can represent  X  and Y  by 
maps 
X , Y  : U  →  B 
X (Y f )(x ) =  D 2  f ( X , Y ) + Dx Y ( X ) f

[ X , Y ] f (x ) =  Dx Y ( X ) − Dx X (Y )  f

We can also get a path of vector ﬁelds at  x  by considering

D Ft (x ) F−t (Y ( Ft (x ))) 
and we deﬁne the Lie Derivative to be 
L X Y  = 
d 
D Ft (x ) F−t (Y ( Ft (x )))
d t 

and hence 

Fortunately we have 

Proposition 21.2. 

L X Y  = [ X , Y ] 

Proof.  Let G s  denote the time s  ﬂow for the vector  ﬁeld 
Y . Then 
f  ◦ F−t  ◦ G s  ◦ Ft (x )|s=0
D Ft (x ) F−t (Y ( Ft (x ))) f  = 
d 
d s 

so that

D Ft (x ) F−t (Y ( Ft (x ))) f |t =0  =

d s 
= −Y ( X f ) + X (Y f ). 

As advertised.

Recall that every square matrix  A with complex entries is conjugate to one in 
Jordan  canonical  form  and  many  theorems  about  matrices  are  obvious  once  we 
use this fact.  So it is in geometry. We already saw one baby example of canonical 
forms. 

Theorem  21.3.  Let  X  be  a  vector  ﬁeld  on  the  Banach  manifold  M  modeled  on 
�= 
B .  Suppose  for  some  m  ∈  M  we  have  X (m ) 
0  Then  there  is  a  chart  φ  : 
U  × (−�, � ) →  M  about m  so that φ ∗ ( X ) = (0, −
d
). 
d t 
In  other words  any  two  vector  ﬁelds  non­zero  at  a  point  in  M  are  equivalent 
in small enough neighborhoods under the action of diffeomorphisms of M  ﬁxing 
the point.
