18  Parametric transversality 

An important tool in differential topology is the notion of transversality. 
Deﬁnition  18.1.  f  :  M  →  N  is said to be transversal to  Z  ⊂  N  if for all m  ∈  M 
we have 
dm  f (Tm M ) + T f (m ) Z  = T f (m ) N . 
This is sometimes written  f  ∩T Z .

Lemma  18.2.  If  f  :  M  →  N  is  transverse  to  Z  then  the  preimage  f −1 ( Z )  is  a 
smooth submanifold of dimension 
dim(M ) − dim( N ) + dim( Z ). 

Proof.  Let  x  ∈ 
f −1 ( Z )  and  choose  charts  (U , φ )  about  x  and  (V , φ )  about 
f (x )  ∈  Z .  We  can  choose  (V , φ )  so  that  ψ ( f (x ))  =  0  and  ψ (V  ∩  Z )  ⊂ 
Rz  × {0} ⊂ Rn .  Let  p :  Rn  → Rn−z  be the projection.  Deﬁne  g  : U  → Rn−z  by 
g (x ) =  p ◦ ψ ◦  f |U (x ). Then the condition that  f  is travsversal to  Z  implies that 
the origin a regular value of g and hence g−1 (0) =  Z  ∩ U  is a submanifold. 

Remark  4.  Often  one  can make  cleaner  statements  by  introducing  the  notion  of 
codimension.  If  Z  ⊂  N  is  a  submanifold  we  deﬁne  codim( Z )  =  dim( N ) − 
dim( Z ).  It is the number of equations required to cut out  Z  locally.  In the above 
theorem  the codimension of  Z  and  f −1 ( Z ) are  the same.  (They are each cut out 
by the same number of equations!) 
Our  aim  is  to  show  that  the  condition  of  being  transversal  is  generic  in  the 
sense  of  Sard’s  theorem.  As  a  model  for  what  we  wish  to  prove  consider  the 
following situation. 
Let 

F :  P × M  →  N 

be a smooth map. 

Theorem 18.3.  Suppose that F  is a submersion, i.e.  the differential of F  is surjec­
tive everywhere.  Suppose  further  that  P ,  M  and  N  are  ﬁnite  dimensional.  Then 
for each  p  ∈  P  we get a map  f p :  M  →  N .  Given a submanifold  Z  of  N  t for a 
generic  p ∈  P  we have  f p  is transversal to  Z . 
Proof.  Since  F  is  a  submersion  F  is  transversal  to  Z  so  that  S  =  F −1 ( Z )  ⊂ 
P × M  is a submanifold. Consider the projection 
p1 :  S →  P . 
Fix ( p, m ) ∈  S and set n =  F ( p, m ) The tangent space of S at ( p, m ) is (v , w) ∈ 
T( p,m ) M  so that d( p,m ) F (v , w) ∈ Tn Z  or equivalently 
dm  f p (w) + d( p,m ) F (v , 0) ∈ Tn Z . 
We claim that  p  is a regular value of the projection if and only if  f p  is transverse 
to  Z . This follows from

Lemma 18.4.  S =  F −1 ( Z ) is transverse to { p} × M  if and only if  f p  is transverse 
to  Z . 

Proof.  The ﬁrst condition is 
0 ⊕ Tm M + (d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ) = T p P ⊕ Tm M 
The second condition is 
d p,m F (0 ⊕ Tm M ) + Tn Z  = Tn N . 
Since  F  is surjective these condition are equivalent. 

Next we  observe  that  the  condition  S  is  transverse  to  { p} ×  M  is  equivalent 
to the condition that  p  is regular value of the projection  p1 | S  :  S  →  P .  The  ﬁrst 
condition is 
0 ⊕ Tm M + (d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ) = T p P ⊕ Tm M 
while the second is 

d p,m p1 : (d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ) = T p P . 
Since 0⊕ Tm M  is the kernel of d p,m p1  is 0⊕ Tm M  these conditions are equivalent. 
Thus we can appeal to Sard’s theorem applied to the projection  p1 :  S →  P  to 
say that a generic  p  ∈  P  is a regular value and by the lemma for generic  p  ∈  P , 
f p  is transverse to  Z . 

Theorem 18.5.  Suppose  that  F  is a submersion,  i.e.  the differential of  F  is sur­
jective everywhere.  Suppose  further  that  P ,  M  and  N  are Banach manifolds  for 
each  p ∈  P  we get the map  f p :  M  →  N  is Fredholm. Given a ﬁnite  dimensional 
submanifold  Z  of  N  then for a residual set of  p  ∈  P  we have  f p  is transversal to 
Z . 
Proof.  We simply need to check the map  p1 | S  :  S →  P  is Fredholm.  To this end 
we need to inspect the proofs of the two lemmas above.  We can sharpen them to 
the following. 
Lemma 18.6.  There an isomorphism 
T p P ⊕ Tm M /(0 ⊕ Tm M + (d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ) → Tn N /d p,m F (0 ⊕ Tm M ) + Tn Z

Proof.  Differential of F  induces a map which is easily seen to be an isomorphism 
using the fact that  F  is a submersion. 

d p,m p1 : (d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ) = T p P . 
Lemma 18.7.  There an isomorphism 
T p P ⊕ Tm M /(0 ⊕ Tm M + (d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ) → T p P /d p,m p1 : (d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ) 

Proof.  Now the differential of  p1  induces the desired map which is easily seen to 
be an isomorphism using the fact that  p1  is a submersion. 
These two lemmas tell us that the cokernel of  p1 | S  is ﬁnite dimensional. 
The kernel of the projection  p1 | S is the intersection (0⊕Tm M ∩(d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ). 
This intersection Fits into a short exact sequence 
0 → ker(dm  f p ) → (0 ⊕ Tm M ∩ (d p,m F )−1 (Tn Z ) → Tn Z  → 0. 
and hence is ﬁnite dimensional. 

The main application we will have of this result is the following result. 
Theorem 18.8.  Let M , N , and Z be smooth manifolds with Z  ⊂  N  a submanifold. 
The set of maps  f  :  M  →  N  in C k (M , N ) which are  transverse  to  Z  is residual 
in C k (M , N ). 

A little later in the course we will deal with giving C k (M , N ) the structure of 
a Banach manifold.
