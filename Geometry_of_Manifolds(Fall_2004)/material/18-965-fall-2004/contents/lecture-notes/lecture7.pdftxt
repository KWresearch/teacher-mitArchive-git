7.2  The tangent bundle 

Let  M  be a smooth manifold.  We will associate  to  M  a bundle  T M .  We will do 
this concretely but there are many ways of doing this. You should read about them 
all!!! 
We know what a tangent vector in Rn . 
Deﬁnition  7.3.  A  tangent  vector  to  M  at  x  is  the  equivalence  class  of  all  pairs 
v , (U , φ ) where (U , φ ) is a chart about x  and v  is a tangent vector to Rn  at φ (x ). 
We say that v � , (U � , φ � ) is equivalent to v , (U , φ ) if 
v � = dφ (x ) (φ � ◦ φ−1 )(v ). 
The tangent bundleT M  to M  is the set of all tangent vectors.

In other words  the  tangent bundle  to  M  is bundle determined by choosing an 
atlas {(Uα , φα )|α  ∈  X } and taking as transition functions 
gαβ (x ) = dφβ (x ) (φα  ◦ φ−1 )(v ).

Given  a  chart  (U , φ ) we get  coordinates  x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n  on U .  A  typical  tan­
gent  X  vector is written as

reminding  us  that  we  can  differentiate  function  using  tangent  vectors.  Given 
f  :  M  → R and a tangent vector at x  i n M  we deﬁne

in other word the usual directional derivative of  f  ◦ φ−1 . 
Given a smooth map  f  :  M  →  N  we can deﬁne  the differential of  f  as a map 
D f  :  T M  → T N . 
Given x  in M  and X  = (v , (U , φ )) a tangent vector and a chart (V , ψ ) about  f (x ) 
set  Dx  f ( X ) to be the equivalence class of the vector 
Dφ (x ) (ψ  ◦  f  ◦ φ−1 )(v )

and the chart, (V , ψ ) or in terms of coordinates if we write 
ψ  ◦  f  ◦ φ−1 (x , x , . . . , x n ) = ( f 1 (x , . . . , x n ), . . . ,  f m (x , . . . , x ))
