The orthogonal group. Let 
O (n ) = { A ∈ Mn×n (R)| A AT  =  I }. 
be  the group of orthogonal  transformations of Rn .  We  claim  that  the orthogonal 
group is a smooth manifold. To see this consider the map 
f  : Mn×n (R) → S ym n (R) 
given by 
f ( A) =  A AT 
where  S ym n (R)  denotes  the  space  of  symmetric  n × n  matrices.  Then  O (n )  = 
f −1 ( I ) so it sufﬁces to show that  I  is a regular value. The differential of  f  is 
D A  f ( B ) =  A B T  + B AT . 
and we must show that it is surjective.  Fix  A  ∈  O (n ) and choose C  ∈  S ym n (R). 
If we take  B  =  2 C A then

Let prove existence and uniqueness theorem for ODEs using the inverse func­
tion theorem. Let  X  :  B →  B  be a smooth map of Banach spaces. We would like 
so see that the differential equation 
d x  =  X (x )x (0) =  x0
d t 
has a unique solution for all x0  ∈  B . Deﬁne a map 
F  : C 1 ([0, � ], B ) → C 0 ([0, � ], B ) × B

Lemma 6.1.  If  X  is  K ­Lipschitz  so  is  F  :  C 0  →  C 0 .  If  X  is C 1  with uniformly

Proof.  | X (x ) − X (x � )|C 0  ≤  K |x − x � |C 0  if  X  is K ­Lipschitz. We also have that
