16.3  Fredholm Operators 

A  nice way  to  think  about  compact  operators  is  to  show  that  set  of  compact  op­
erators  is  the  closure  of  the  set  of  ﬁnite  rank  operator  in  operator  norm.  In  this 
sense compact operator are similar to the ﬁnite  dimensional case. One property of 
ﬁnite  rank operators that does not generalize to this setting is theorem from linear 
algebra  that  if  T :  X  →  Y  is a  linear  transformation of  ﬁnite  dimensional vector 
spaces then 

dim(ker(T )) − dim(Coker(T )) = dim( X ) − dim(Y ).
35 
Of  course  if  X  or  Y  is  in ﬁnite  dimensional  then  the  right  hand  side  of  equal­
ity  does  not make  sense  however  the  stability  property  that  the  equality  implies 
could be generalized.  This brings us to the study of Fredholm operators.  It turns 
out  that  many  of  the  operators  arising  naturally  in  geometry,  the  Laplacian,  the 
Dirac operator etc give rise to Fredholm operators.  The following is mainly from 
H ¨ormander 
Deﬁnition  16.13.  Let X  and Y  be Banach spaces and let T  :  X  → Y  be a bounded 
linear operator.  T  is said to be Fredholm if the following hold. 

1.  ker(T ) is ﬁnite dimensional. 

2.  Ran(T ) is closed. 

3.  Coker(T ) is ﬁnite dimensional. 
If T  is Fredholm deﬁne  the index of T  denoted Ind(T ) to be the number dim(ker(T ))− 
dim(Coker(T )) 

First let us show that the closed range condition is redundant. 
Lemma 16.14.  Let  T  :  X  →  Y  be a operator so  that  the range admits a closed 
complementary subspace.  Then the range of T  is closed. 

Proof:  C  be  a  closed  complement  for  the  range.  We  can  assume  that  T  is 
injective since ker(T ) is a closed subspace and hence X / ker(T ) is a Banach space 
so we can replace T  by the induced map from this quotient. Now consider the map 
S  :  X ⊕ C  → Y  deﬁned by 

S (x , c) = T (x ) + c. 
S  is bounded linear isomorphism and hence by the open mapping theorem  S  is a 
topological isomorphism. Thus Ran(T ) =  S ( X ⊕ {0}) is closed. 
. 
An  important  result  that will  be  used  over  and  over  again  is  the  openness  of 
invertibility in the operator norm. 
Theorem  16.15.  If  T  :  X  →  Y  is  a  bounded  invertible  operator  then  for  all 
p :  X  → Y  with sufﬁciently small norm  T  +  p  is also invertible. 

36 

Proof.  Without loss of generality we can assume  X  =  Y  and T  =  I .  Then if the 
� 
norm of  p  is sufﬁciently small the Neumann series 
∞
(− p)i 
i =1 

converges to the inverse of  I  +  p . 
We begin with some lemma’s 

Lemma 16.16.  (F. Riesz) The unit ball  B  in a Banach space  X  is compact if and 
only if  B  is ﬁnite dimensional. 

Proof.  See Kerszig Lemma 2.5­4. This is easy for Hilbert spaces but takes a little 
care for Banach spaces. 

Lemma 16.17.  The following are equivalent: 

1.  ker(T )) is ﬁnite dimensional and Ran( T ) is closed. 
2.  Every  bounded  sequence  {x i } ⊂  X  with  T x i  convergent  has  a  convergent 
subsequence. 

Proof:  Suppose  that  1  holds.  Since  ker(T )  is  ﬁnite  dimensional  it  admits  a 
closed compliment C .  Since Ran(T ) is closed it is a Banach space so the Banach 
isomorphism  theorem  implies  T |C  :  C  →  Ran(T )  is  an  isomorphism  and  the 
result follows. Now suppose that 2 holds.  Then a bounded sequence in the kernel 
has a convergent subsequence so the kernel is  ﬁnite  dimensional.  That Ran(T ) is 
closed follows immediately from 2. 
Let  Fred( X , Y )  denote  the  space  of  Fredholm  operators  between  X  and  Y . 
Also let Fred( X ) be the set of Fredholm operators on  X 
Lemma 16.18.  Fred( X , Y ) is a open subset of B( X , Y ) and the index is a locally 
constant function on Fred( X , Y ). 
Proof.  Let T  :  X  → Y  be a Fredholm operator and let  p  :  X  → Y  be an operator 
with  small  norm.  We  can write  X  =  C  + ker(T )  and  Y  =  Ran(T ) +  D . With

We prove the result by reduction to the  ﬁnite  dimensional situation.  In fact we’ll 
prove 
Lemma 16.19.  For  p sufﬁciently  small there is a linear transformation A  : ker(T ) → 
Coker(T ) so that 
ker(T  + p) ≡ ker( A) and Coker(T  + p) ≡ Coker( A). 
In fact the norm of  p  is small enough then T  + a will be invertible and if we

The lemma follows immediately from this taking  A = −c(T  + a )−1b + d . 
The proof of the lemma proved the following conceptually useful result 
Lemma 16.20.  Let T :  X  → Y  be a Fredholm map and  p :  X  → Y  a linear map. 
If  p has sufﬁciently  small norm then there are isomorphisms i :  X � ⊕ K  →  X  and

We’ll also need the notion of the adjoint of an operator.  If X  is a Banach space 
the  dual  space  of  X  is  the  space  of  all  bounded  linear  functionals  on  X  and  is 
denoted  X ∗ .  Given  a  bounded  linear  operator  T  :  X  →  Y  we  have  get  a  linear 
operator

by declaring that for ρ  ∈ Y ∗ , T ∗ (ρ ) is the linear functional so which send x  to 
ρ (T (x )).

First we give the dual characterization of the norm.

Lemma 16.21.  For all x  ∈  X 

�x � =  sup  (|ρ (x )|) 
�ρ �=1 

Proof.  Fix x0  ∈  X  Certainly |ρ (x0 )| ≤ �ρ ��x0� so 
�x0� ≥  sup  (|ρ (x0 )|) 
�ρ �=1 
Deﬁne  a  linear  functional λ  :  span(x0 ) →  R by λ(x0 )  =  �x0� and extending by 
linearity to the span. Applying the Hahn­Banach theorem to λ and the subadditive 
function  p(x ) = �x � implies the existence of an extension of λ to the whole of  X 
with 
|λ(x )| ≤ �x � 

Lemma 16.22.  If T  is bounded then T ∗  is bounded with the same norm 

Proof.

We’ll need the relationship between the cokernel of T  and the kernel of T ∗ . 
Lemma 16.23.  If T  has closed range then 
Coker(T )∗ ≡ ker(T 
∗ ). 

39 

Proof.  There  is  a  natural  map  ker(T ∗ )  →  Coker(T )∗  by  sending  ρ  ∈  ker(T ∗ ) 
to  the  linear  functional  λ  ∈  Coker(T )∗  where  λ( y  +  T X )  =  ρ ( y ).  This  well 
deﬁned  since  for  all  x  ∈  X  we  have  ρ (T x )  =  T ∗ (ρ )(x )  =  0.  Since Ran(T )  is 
closed, Coker(T ) =  Y /Ran(T ) is a Banach space.  Given a linear functional λ  ∈ 
Coker(T )∗  so λ :  Y /Ran(T ) → R and hence deﬁnes a bounded linear functional 
ρ :  Y  → Y /Ran(T ) → R. 
Now (T ∗ρ )(x )  =  ρ (T (x ))  =  0.  It  is easy  to check  that  this  inverts  the previous 
construction. 

Next we observe that compactness is preserved under taking adjoints. 
Lemma 16.24.  Let K :  X  → Y  be compact then K ∗ :  Y ∗ →  X ∗  is compact. 

Proof.  This  takes a  little work.  See  for example Kreszig  Introductory  functional 
analysis with applications Theorem 8.2­5. 
Lemma 16.25.  Let K  :  X  →  X  be a compact operator. Then  I + K  is Fredholm. 
Proof:  First  we  coincide  the  kernel  of  I  +  K .  Let  B  be  the  unit  ball  in 
ker( I  +  K ).  Then  B  =  K ( B )  so  B  is  image  of  a  bounded  set  under  a  compact 
operator hence is precompact. But B is closed so B is compact. By Riesz’s lemma 
ker( I  +  K )  is  ﬁnite  dimensional.  Next we  show  that Ran( I  +  K )  is  closed.  By 
lemma  16.17 it sufﬁces  to show that if x i  is a bounded sequence so that x i  + K i x i 
converges to y  ∈ Y  then there is x  ∈  X  so that x + K x  =  y . Since {x i } is bounded 
there  is  a  subsequence  x i j  so  that  {K x i j }  converges.  But  then  {x i j }  converges. 
Thus the operator  I + K  is a semi­Fredholm. Applying the same arguement to the 
adjoint  I  + K ∗  completes the proof. 
Next we give a useful characterization of Fredholm operators. 
Theorem  16.26.  T  :  X  →  Y  is  Fredholm  if  and  only  this  a  bounded  linear 
operator  R  : Y  →  X  so that 

R T  −  I  and T R −  I 

are compact operators. 

40 

Proof.  If T  is Fredholm then as before we can write 
X  =  X 
� ⊕ ker(T ) andY  = Ran(T ) ⊕ C 
for closed subspaces X � ⊂  X  and C  ⊂ Y .  T | X �  :  X � → Ran(T ) is an isomorphism 
so  it  has  and  inverse  R˜ .  Extending  R˜ to  a  map  Y  →  X  using  the  direct  sum 
decomposition gives the required map. 
If  R  exists  ker(T )  is  ﬁnite  dimensional  from  the  equation  R T  =  I  +  K . 
Ran(T ) is  ﬁnite  dimensional from the equation T R  =  I  + K �  and the operator is 
Fredholm. 

Next we consider the composition of Fredholm operators. 
Lemma  16.27.  Let  T  :  X  →  Y  and  S  :  Y  →  Z  be Fredholm  operators.  Then 
S T  :  X  →  Z  is Fredholm. Furthermore Ind( S T ) = Ind(T ) + Ind( S ). 
Proof: Since ( S T )−1 (0) = T −1 ( S−1 (0)) we have dim(ker( S T )) ≤ dim(ker( S ))+ 
dim(ker(T )).  Similarly dim(Coker( S T )) ≤  dim(Coker( S )) + dim(Coker(T )) so 
the composition is Fredholm. 
Next we consider the index assertion. To this end consider the family of oper­
� 
� 
ators  At  : Y  ⊕ X  →  Z ⊕ X  deﬁned by the equation 
cos (t ) S  −s i n (t ) S T

s i n (t ) I 
cos (t )T

for  0  ≤  t  ≤  1.  We  claim  that  At  is  a  continuous  family  of Fredholm  operators. 
But

S  0

So  At  is  the composition of Fredholm operators and hence  is Fredholm.  Clearly 
Ind( A0 ) = Ind(T ) + Ind( S ) and Ind( Aπ ) = Ind( S T ).
