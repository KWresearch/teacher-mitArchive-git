11  The embedding manifolds in R N 
Theorem 11.1.  (The Whitney Embedding Theorem, Easiest Version).  Let  X  be a 
compact n ­manifold.  Then  X  admits a embedding in R N . 
Proof.  First  we  construct  an  embedding  �  :  X  →  R N  for  some  large  N .  Let 
{ f i }i
k =1  be a partition of unity so that the support of each  f i  is contained in some 
coordinate  chart  (Ui , φi )  so  that  φi (Ui )  is  bounded.  Then  we  can  construction 
smooth functions φ˜
� 
i  :  X  → Rn  by 
φ˜
i (x ) = 
f i (x )φi (x )	
0 

if  x  ∈ Ui 
if  x  ∈ Ui 

. 

Then we can deﬁne � by the equation 
1 (x ), φ˜
�(x ) = (φ˜
2 (x ), . . . , φ˜

k (x ),  f 1 (x ),  f 2 (x ), . . . ,  f k (x )). 

�= 

0  so  that 

Then  �(x )  =  �(x � )  implies  that  for  some  i ,  f i (x )  =  f i (x � ) 
x , x  ∈ Ui . Then for the same i  we have 
φi (x ) = φi (x 
� ) 
and hence x  =  x �  since φi  is a diffeomorphism on Ui  and so � is injective. 
Next we need  to check  that  the differential of �  is  injective.  The differential 
of � at x  send v  ∈ Tx X  to 
( Dx  f 1 (v )φ1 (x )+ f 1 (x ) Dx φ1 (v ), . . . , Dx  f k (v )φk (x )+ f k (x ) Dx φk (v ), Dx  f 1 (v ), . . . , Dx  f k (v )) 
and the result follows.
