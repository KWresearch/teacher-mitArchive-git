2  Smooth maps and the notion of equivalence 
Let X and Y  be smooth manifolds. A continuous map  f  :  X  → Y  is called smooth 
if for all charts (U , φ ) for and  X  and (V , ψ ) for Y  we have that the composition 
ψ  ◦  f  ◦ φ−1 : φ (U  ∩  f 
−1 (V )) → ψ (V ) 

is smooth. 
Two manifolds X  and Y  are called diffeomorphic if there is a homeomorphism 
h  :  X  → Y  so that h  and h−1  are smooth. 

3  Standard pathologies. 

The condition that X  be Hausdorff and second countable does not follow from the 
existence of an atlas. 
The  line  with  two  origins.  Let  X  be  the  quotient  space  of R × {0, 1}  by  the 
equivalence relation (t , 1)  ≡  (t , 0) unless  t  =  0.  Then  X  is not Hausdorff, how­
ever X  admits an atlas with two charts. Let Ui  be the image of R × {i } in X . These 
maps invert to give coordinates. 
Remark  1.  Actually  non­Hausdorff  spaces  which  satisfy  all  the  other  properties 
arise  in  real  life  for  example  in  the  theory of  foliations or when  taking quotients 
by non­ compact group actions.  More work  is required  to come up with a useful 
notions to replace that of manifolds in this context. 
The  long  line.  Let  S�  denote  the  smallest  uncountable  totally  ordered  set. 
Consider  the  product  X  =  S�  ×  (0, 1]  with  dictionary  order  topology.  Then 
give  X  charts  as  follows.  For  (ω , t )  ∈  X  if  t  �=  1  let  U(ω ,t )  = {ω} ×  (0, 1) 
and  φ(ω ,t ) :  U  →  R  be  given  by  φ(ω ,t ) (ω , t )  =  t .  If  t  =  1  let  S (ω)  denote  the 
� 
successor of ω.  Set U(ω ,1)  = {ω} × (0, 1] sup{ S (ω)} × (0, 1) and 
if η = ω 
φ(ω ,t ) (η, t ) = 
t 
t + 1 
if η =  S (ω). 
Exercise 5.  Check that overlaps are smooth.

The collection {U(ω ,1/2) }ω∈ Sω  is uncountable and consists of disjoint open sets, 
so  X  is not second countable. 
Different charts 
Consider R1  denote R with the following charts (R, x ) and R2  with the chart 
(R, x 3 ).  Identity  map  R1  →  R2  is  smooth  but  not  R2  →  R1 .  R1  and  R2  are 
�→  x 
3  thought of as a map from R1  → R2 .
diffeomorphic by the map x 
These pathologies are  simple problems  to keep  in mind when  thinking about 
the  deﬁnitions.  There  are  far more  subtle  issues  that  arise.  Given  a  topological 
manifold we  can  ask  can  carry  an  atlas,  and  if  it  carries  an  atlas how many non­
diffeomorphic  atlases  does  it  carry.  The  ﬁrst  observation  of  this  phenomenon  is 
due  to  John Milnor who  showed  that  the  seven­sphere  admits  an  atlas  (with  two 
charts!) which is not diffeomorphic to the standard differentiable structure. We’ll 
examine this example later in the course.
