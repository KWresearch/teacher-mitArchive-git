7  Vector bundles and the differential 
Consider the Grassman manifold say Gr2 (R4 ) of two planes in R4 . Let 
γ  = {(�, x ) ∈ Gr2 (R4 ) × R4 |x  ∈ �}. 
Let  p :  γ  →  Gr2 (R4 )  be  the  natural  projection.  The  ﬁbers  of  p ,  p−1 (�)  are 
vector spaces (in this case over the reals). 
This  is  an  example  of  a  vector  bundle.  We’ll  give  the  deﬁnition  appropriate 
for  the world of smooth manifolds.  There  is an obvious version of  the deﬁnition 
for more general topological spaces. 

Deﬁnition  7.1.  Let V  be a vector space (over the reals, complexes or quaternions.) 
A  vector  bundle  with  ﬁber  V  is  a  triple  ( E , B , p)  where  E  and  B  are  smooth 
manifolds  and  π  :  E  →  B  is  a  smooth map.  For  each  b  ∈  B ,  p−1 (b)  has  the 
structure  of  a  vector  space  over  the  same  ﬁeld  as  V  and  for  each  b  ∈  B  there  is 
an open set U  and a smooth map φ :  p−1 (U ) →  V  which  is  linear  isomorphism 
In  addition  the  map  τφ  :  p−1 (U )  →  U  ×  V  given  by  τφ (e)  = 
on  each  ﬁber. 
( p(e), φ (e)) is a diffeomorphism. 

The map τφ  is called a local trivialization. 
Example 7.2.  Let 

γ  = {(�, v ) ⊂ Grk (Rn ) × Rn |v  ∈ �}. 
We claim as the natural projection  p  : γ  → Grk (Rn ) has the structure of a vector 
bundle with  ﬁber  Rk .  Let  φ  :  U�  →  hom(�, �⊥ )  be  one  of  our  charts.  Then 
φ−1  is  given  by  A  →  � A  ⊂  Rn  =  � ⊕ �⊥  where � A  denotes  the  graph  of  A. 
The map φ  :  p−1 (U� ) → � is simply the orthogonal projection. 
A very important notion is the transition function.  Suppose we are given two 
trivializations τα :  p−1 (Uα ) → Uα  × V  and τβ :  p−1 (Uβ ) → Uβ  × V .  Then get 
a map 
gαβ : Uα  ∩ Uβ  → Gl(V ). 

deﬁned as follows.  If 
τα (v ) = ( p(v ), φα (v )) and τβ (v ) = ( p(v ), φβ (v )) 

15 

then 

gαβ ( p(v ))φβ (v ) = φα (v ). 
The  transition  function  satisfy  the  cocycle  condition:  If we have  three  trivializa­
tions τα , τβ , τγ  over open sets Uα , Uβ , Uγ  then for all x  ∈ Uα  ∩ Uβ  ∩ Uγ 
gαβ gβ γ gγ α  = 1 
A vector bundle is determined its transition functions and give an open cover 
{Uα } 
and a collection of functions 
gαβ : Uα  ∩ Uβ  → Gl(V ). 
satisfying the cocycle condition we can construct a vector bundle. 

7.1  New vector bundles from old 

We  can  get  new  vector  bundles  from  old  bundles  in  a  number  of  ways.  Given 
p1 :  V1  →  X  and  p2 :  V2  →  X  we  can  take  direct  (or  Whitney)  sum  to  get  a 
bundle V1 ⊕ V2  →  X whose ﬁber  above x  is  p
−1 (x ) ⊕ p
−1 (x ). Another important 
operation is the pullback. Suppose we have  p :  V  →  X  and  f  : Y  →  X  a smooth

map. Then we can form a vector bundle over Y  as follows. The total space denoted 
f ∗ (V ) is: 

and projection 

∗ (V ) = {( y , v )| f ( y ) =  p(v )} 
f 
∗ ( p)( y , v ) =  y .
