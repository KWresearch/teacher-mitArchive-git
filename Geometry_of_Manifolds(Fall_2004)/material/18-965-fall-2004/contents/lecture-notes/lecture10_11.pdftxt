12  Sard’s Theorem 

An extremely important notion in differential topology is that that of general posi­
tion or genercity.  A particular map may have some horrible pathologies but often 
a nearby map has much nicer properties. 
For example the map 
f (θ ) = ((cos(2θ ) cos(θ ), cos(2θ ) sin(θ ), 0). 
maps  the unit circle  in  the plain  to  the a  ﬁgure  8  lying  in a plane  in R3  while  the 
near by map 

f � (θ ) = (cos(2θ ) cos(θ ), cos(2θ ) sin(θ ), � cos(θ )). 

is an embedding. We will develop a general setting in which we can decide when 
a  nearby  map  will  have  some  nice  property.  These  ideas  have  been  central  in 
topology  since  early  days  of  Lagrange,  Poincar ´e  and  where  put  into  a  modern 
efﬁcient setting by Thom and Smale. 
The most basic result we will need is Sard’s Theorem. A subset of a manifold 
is said  to have measure zero  if  its  intersection with every chart has measure zero 
with  respect  to  the  Lebesque  measure  on  Rn .  We  will  need  an  easy  version  of 
Fubini’s theorem.

Theorem  12.1.  Suppose  a  measureable  C  ⊂  Rn  has  the  property  that  for  all 
t  ∈ R C ∩ {t } × Rn−1  has measure zero.  Then C  has measure zero. 
We will also use the following lemma. 
Lemma 12.2.  If C  ⊂  Rm  is measureable and  f  :  Rm  →  Rn  is continuous  then 
f (C ) is measureable. 
Theorem 12.3.  Let  f  :  M  →  N  be a smooth map of ﬁnite  dimensional manifolds. 
Then the set of critical values has measure zero in  N . 

Proof.  (Copied  from  Milnor’s  little  blue  book  Topology  from  the  differentiable 
viewpoint,  this  proof  does  not  give  the  sharp  result  that  a  C k  map  with  k  ≥ 
max{1, m − n + 1} also satisiﬁes the  conclusion.) The de ﬁnition  of measure zero 
to prove  the  result  in  case  M  ⊂  Rm  and  N  ⊂  Rn  are open 
is  local  so  it  sufﬁces 
subsets. 
The proof is by induction on m  the dimension of the domain. The case m  = 0 
is trivial. Let C  = C r i t ( f ) denote the critical set of  f .  It sufﬁces  to prove that for 
every  point  y  ∈  f (C )  there  is  neighborhood  of  y  whose  intersection with  f (C ) 
has measure zero. Now set 
Cs  = {x  ∈  M |dx
j  f  = 0, for all 1 ≤  j  ≤ k } 
Then  C  ⊃  C1  ⊃  C2 
⊃ 
. . .  is  a  desceding  sequence  of  closed  sets  and  hence 
measureable sets.  Futhermore the sets  f (Cs  \ Cs+1 ) are all measureable. 
The proof has three steps.  If m  ≤ n  then you can skip directly to step 3. 
Step 1.  f (C  \ C1 ) has measure zero.  If  x  ∈  C  ⊂  C1  then  there  is some  ﬁrst 
partial which doesn’t vanish so assume that 
(x )  �= 0. 
∂ f 1 
∂ x1 
Then we consider the map g :  Rm  → Rm . 
g (x  , . . . , x m ) = ( f 1 (x  , . . . , x m ), x 2 , . . . , x m )

which is clearly invertible. The inverse function theorem then provides an inverse, 
h :  V  → Rm ,on small neighborhood of x  Then consider the map  f  ◦ h we have 
f  ◦ h (x 1 
, . . . , x m ) = (x 1 ,  f 2  ◦ h (x , . . . , x m ), . . . ,  f n  ◦ h (x , . . . , x )).

So  f (C  ∩ h (V ))  =  f  ◦ h (h−1 (C ) ∩ V ).  The  inverse  image  of  the  set  critical 
h−1 (C ) ∩ V  are simply the critical points of  f  ◦ h .  If we set 
, x , . . . , x m ) = ( f 2  ◦ h (t , . . . , x m ), . . . ,  f n  ◦ h (t , . . . , x ))

then 

−1 (C ) ∩ V  = ∪t {t } × C r i t (kt ). 
By the induction hypothesis we have 

h

kt (C r i t (kt )) 
has measure zero in Rm−1  and hence by Fubini 
f (C ∩ h (V )) = ∪t  {t } × kt (C r i t (kt )) 
has measure zero in Rm . 
Step 2. Suppose x  ∈ Cs \Cs+1 . Then without loss of generality we can assume 
that there is some s ­th order mixed partial derivative so that if we set 
∂ i1+...+im  f 
w = 
∂ (x 1 )i1  . . . ∂ (x m )im 

so that 

(x )  �= 0. 
∂ w 
∂ x 1 
Deﬁne 
g (x 1 , . . . , x m ) = (w(x , . . . , x m ), x 2 , . . . , x m ).

Again this map is a diffeomorphism with inverse h :  V  → Rm  for some neighbor­
hood V  of g (x ). Let 
k  =  f  ◦ h 
k¯ = k |{0}×Rm−1∩V . 

and let

Clearly g (Ck  ∩ h (V )) ⊂ {0} × Rm−1 ∩ V  and the critical set of k¯ contains g (Ck  ∩ 
h (V )) since it contains g (C ∩ h (V )). Thus 
f (Ck  ∩ h (V )) ⊂ k¯ (C r i t (k¯ )) 
which has measure zero by the induction hypothesis. 
Step 3.  Suppose that x  ∈ Ck  where k + 1 >  m .  Choose a little cube  I  of side 
n 
length δ .  We have from Taylors theorem and the compactness of  I  that there is a 
constant M  > 0 so that for all  y  ∈ I  and all x  ∈ Ck  ∩ I 
� f (x ) −  f ( y )� ≤ M �x − y �k+1 
Subdivide  I  into l m  subcubes of side length δ/ l . By the above estimate if  I � is 
such a subcube containing a point of Ck  then  f ( I � ) is contained in a cube of side 
√
length at most 
k+1
m (δ/ l )

Thus the  f (Ck  ∩ I ) is contained in set of total volume bounded above 
√
m (δ/ l )k+1 )n l m  = C l m−n (k+1) . 
(2M

By our assumption this goes to zero as l  goes to inﬁnity.
