13  Stratiﬁed Spaces 
n
Deﬁnition  13.1.  A  stratiﬁcation  of  a  topological  space  X  is  a  ﬁltraion 
is  a  de­
composition  X  = 
i =0  Si  where each of  the  Si  are smooth manifolds (possibily 
empty) of dimension i  and so that 
k−1
 
i =0 

Sk  \ Sk  ⊂ 

The closure  Sk  is called the stratum of dimension k . 

Note that any stratum of a stra ﬁed space is a stratiﬁed space in its own right. 
Stratiﬁed  spaces are useful because many results about smooth manifolds can 
be extended to stratiﬁed  spaces.  A good example is the space of matrices Mk×n l. 
The  strata  are  the  matrices  of  rank  bounded  above  by  a  ﬁxed  number.  (assume 
that k  ≤ n ) 
As an application of this result we will compute the low homotopy groups for 
the  Stiefel  manifolds,  Stk (Rn ).  Recall  that  the  Stiefel  manifold  is  the  space  of 
k ­frames  in Rn .  Given  a  k ­frame  (v1 , v2 , . . . , vk ) we get  an  injective  linear map 
A  :  Rk  →  Rn  by sending the standard basis vectors ei  →  vi .  In other words we 
can  identify  the  Stiefel manifold,  Vk (Rn ),  with  the  open  subset  of  hom(Rk , Rn ) 
consisting  of  injective  maps.  The  compliment  of  Vk (Rn )  has  a  decomposition 
according to the dimension of the kernel of the map. To codify this set 
Rl  = { A ∈ hom(Rk , Rn )|Rank( A)) = l }. 
We claim that in fact these  Rl  are submanifolds. 
Proposition 13.2.  Rl  ⊂ hom(Rk , Rn ) is a smooth submanifold of codimension 
(k − l )(n − l ).

Proof.  Fix  A ∈ Sl . Write Rk  = ker( A) ⊕ Ran( A∗ ) and Rn  = ker( A∗ ) + Ran( A).

Lemma  13.3.  If  A¯ + α  is  invertible  then  a  vector  (v , w)  is  in  the  kernel  of  B  if 
and only if v = −( A¯ + α )−1βw and (δ − γ ( A¯ + α )−1β )v = 0 

and a nearby matrix as 

Proof.  If (v , w) is the the kernel of  B  then 
( A¯ + α )v + βw = 0 
so the  ﬁrst  equation is clear.  The second equation follows by substituting the  ﬁrst 
into 
γ v + δw = 0 

The map 

The lemma implies that the kernel of  B  is l ­dimensional if and only if

is clearly a submersion so the preimage of 0, our local model of  Rl  is a submani­
fold of codimension 
dim(ker( A)) dim(Coker( A)) = (k − l )(n − l ).

We’ll use this to do a simple calculation of homotopy groups. 
πi (Stk (Rn ) = 0 
for  i  <  n  − k .  From  its  deﬁnition  Stk (Rn )  can  be  identiﬁed  with  the  space  of 
matrices of maximal rank in Mk×n  and so 
Stk (Rn ) =  Mk×n  \ (∪k−1 
l=0  Rl 
so the problem is to show that a map 
f  :  S i  → Stk (Rn ) 
from a sphere of dimension i  < n − k  is null homotopic. We know that there is a 
null­homotopy in the larger contractible space of matrices that is to say there is a 
map 

h  :  D i +1  →  Mk×n .

so that 

h |i
S  = 
f .
If we can ﬁnd  a homotopy k  :  I × D i +1  →  Mk×n  so that during the homotopy 
the following two conditions hold. 
1.  k | I  × S i  ⊂ Stk (Rn ) 
2.  k ({1} × D i +1 ) ⊂ Stk (Rn ). 
To see that we can do this we will appeal to Sard’s theorem. Lets consider the 
larger family of maps 

H  :  Mk×n  × D i +1  →  Mk×n 

given by 

H ( A , x ) =  A + h (x ). 

If  A is small enough then 
k (t , x ) =  H (t A , x ) = t A +  f (x ) 
the  ﬁrst  condition.  To  see  that we can arrange  that  the  second condition 
satisﬁes 
is satisﬁed  we note that  H  is a submersion. Thus the preimages of the  Rl ’s are all 
submanifolds.  Set 
R˜
l  =  H 
−1 ( Rl )

these are submanifolds of codimension (k − l )(n − l ).  so they have dimension 
i + 1 + n k − (k − l )(n − l ) 
Consider the projection  R˜
l  → Mk×n .  Provided that for all l  ≤ k − 1 
i + 1 + n k − (k − l )(n − l ) < n k 
then image of the projection has measure zero.  The worst case is l  = k − 1 when 
the right hand side is 
i + n k + k − n 
so  that the  inequality holds if i  <  n − k .  If ( A , x )  � R˜
l  that for all  x f (x )  � Rl 
completing the proof.
