5  Inverse, and implicit function theorems. 

Among the basic tools of the trade are the inverse and implicit function theorems. 
We will ﬁrst  state them in a coordinate dependent fashion. When we develop some 
of the basic terminology we will have available a coordinate free version. 
Theorem  5.1.  Let  U  be  a  neighborhood  let  f  :  U  ⊂  V  →  W  be  a  smooth 
map.  Suppose  dx  f  :  Rn  →  Rn  is  invertible  for  some  x  ∈  U .  Then  there  is  a 
neighborhood U � ⊂ U  of x  so that 
� →  f (U 
f |U 
� ) 

is a diffeomorphism. Furthermore 

−1 ) = (d0  f )−1 . 
d0 ( f 

Proof.  We will construct an inverse for  f  using the contraction mapping theorem. 
It is enough to prove the result in the case that x  = 0 and  f (0) = 0 and D0  f  = I d . 
(For the last condition replace  f  by ( D0  f )−1  ◦  f ..  Set g (x ) =  f (x ) − x  (so g is 
f .) The equation  f (x ) = y  can be rewritten as 
the “nonlinear” part of 
x + g (x ) = y 

or as the ﬁxed point equation 

y − g (x ) = x . 
We  claim  that  if  f  is  C 1  then  for  y  in  a  small  enough  neighborhood  of  0  x  �→ 
y − g (x ) = h y (x ) is a contraction mapping on a small enough ball. 
Since  D0h y (x )  =  0  and  h y  is  C 1  there  is  a  neighborhood  Br (0)  so  that

Thus  for  y  ∈  Br /2  we  have  h y ( Br )  ⊂  Br  and  h y  is  a  contraction  there.  The 
contraction mapping  theorem  implies  for  each  y  the  existence  of  a  unique  ﬁxed 
point φ ( y ) which is a least a set wise inverse for  f . 
We check that φ ( y ) is continuous.

where we  use  the  differentiability  of  f  to  go  from  the  second  to  third  lines  and 
and inequality 1 to go from the third to the fourth. 
Notice that if  f  is continuously differentiable then so is φ . 

An important corollary of the inverse function theorem is the implicit function 
theorem.  The  implicit  function  theorem  can  be  stated  in  various,  each  useful  in 
some  situation.  We  will  use  repeatedly  the  Open  Mapping  Theorem  which  say 
that a surjective bounded linear map between Banach spaces is an open mapping 
in particular an bounded linear map which is an algebraic isomorphism is an iso­
morphism.

Theorem 5.2.  Let  f  :  U  ⊂  V  →  W  be a  smooth map with  f (0)  =  0.  Suppose 
that for some x  in U  we have that Dx  f  is surjective and ker( Dx  f ) admits a closed 
complement C .  Then there are neighborhoods U1  of 0 ∈ ker( Dx  f ), U2  of 0 ∈ W 
and diffeomorphisms φ  :  U1  × U2  →  U  and ψ :  U2  →  W  so  that  the  following 
diagram commutes: 

U  −→ 
f 
W
↑ φ 
↑ ψ 
U1 × U2  −→ 
p2  U2
where  p2  denotes the projection on the second factor. 
Proof.  Write  a  typical  element  of  U  as  a  pair  (k , c)  with  k  ∈  k er ( Dx  f )  and 
c  ∈  C .  The  fact  that C  is closed means  in  implies  that C  is a C  a Banach  space 
in  its  own  right.  Then  the  map  K  × C  →  V  given  by  (k , c)  →  k  +  c  is  an 
isomorphism by the Open Mapping Theorem.  The Open Mapping Theorem also 
implies  that  d0,0  f |C  :  C  →  W  is  an  isomorphism.  Let  L  :  W  →  C  denote  its 
inverse. Consider the map

We have that 

F (k , c) = (k , L f (k , c)).

and  again  by  the  Open  Mapping  Theorem  the  differential  of  F  at  (0, 0)  is  an 
isomorphism.  The  inverse  function  theorem  implies  F  has  an  inverse,  φ ,  in  a 
neighborhood of (0, 0).  Setting ψ  = d0,0  f |C  we have 
f (φ (k , c)) = ψ ( p2 (k , c)) 
on a sufﬁciently small neighborhood of (0,  0) since 
L f (φ (k , c)) = c 

on such a neighborhood. 

We call a point x  where  Dx  f  is not a surjective a critical point. A point in the 
range of  f  which is not the image of a critical point is called a regular value.

Deﬁnition  5.3.  A subset Y  of a manifold  X  is called submanifold if for all  y  ∈ Y 
there  is  a neighborhood U  of Y  and  a  chart φ  :  V  →  B  so  that φ (Y  ∩ U )  is  an 
open subset of a closed linear subspace admitting a complement. 

Having made these deﬁnition  we have a corollary of the implicit function the­
orem. 

Corollary 5.4.  The preimage of a regular value is a submanifold.
