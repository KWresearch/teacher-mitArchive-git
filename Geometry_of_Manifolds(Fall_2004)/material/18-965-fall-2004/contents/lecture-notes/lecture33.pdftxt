re ﬁnement
By a reﬁnement V of an open cover U we mean a V = {Vβ |β ∈ B } and a map
r : B → A so that for all β ∈ B we have Vβ ⊂ Ur (β ) . If we have a reﬁnement
then there is a chain map of the ˇCeck complexes.
˜r : ˇC p (U) → ˇC p (V)

given by the formula 
r˜ ({ fβ0β1 ...β p }) = { fβr (0)βr (1) ...βr ( p) |Vβr (0) βr (1) ...βr ( p) 
} 
Thus there is a map 
:  Hˇ ∗ (U) → Hˇ ∗ (V).

r 
Thus  we  have  an  directed  system  (well  really  need  to  check  that  if  we  have 
two reﬁnements  V, r  and V, r � then the induced maps r˜ and r˜ � are the same.) The 
direct limit of this system is called the  ˇCech cohomology of  X . 

27  The acyclicity of the sheaf of  p­forms. 
Then  we  can  consider  another  version  of  the  of  the  ˇCech  complex.  That  is  we 
ˇC p (U, �q )  to be all colletions of q ­forms ωα0 ...α p  deﬁned  on Uα0 ...α p  with 
deﬁne 
the  symmetry  properties  above.  The  same  formula  above  deﬁnes  a  differential 
mapping 
C p (U, �q ) → ˇ

Lemma 27.1.  This sequence is exact so long as k  > 0. 
Proof.  Fix  a  partition  of  unity  {φβ |β  ∈ B } subordinate  to  U  = {Uα }α∈ A .  The 
supports of the φβ  are a reﬁnement  of the Uα  and we choose a reﬁnement  function 
r  :  B → A so that s u p p(φβ ) ⊂ r (β ). Deﬁne

Since  the  supports of  the φβ s  are  locally  ﬁnite  by deﬁnition  of partition of unity 
this is well deﬁned.  Now consider where k  ≥ 1

We have used  that  the sum  if  locally  ﬁnite 
to  rearrange  the order summation. 
Thus  we  have  proved  the  identity  is  cochain  homotopic  to  zero  and  so  the  co­
homology  groups  are  zero.  Note  that  if  k  =  0  then we  simple  get  zero  and  the 
arguement proves nothing.
