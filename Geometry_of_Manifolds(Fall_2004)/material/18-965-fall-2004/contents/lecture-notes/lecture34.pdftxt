28  The Poincar ´
Cech
cohomology and de Rham cohomology 

The  proof  here  is modelled  on  the  presentation  of Weil’s  proof  (see Weil,  Andr 
“Sur  les  thormes  de  de  Rham.”  Comment.  Math.  Helv.  26,  (1952).  119–145.) 
in  Principles of Algerbraic Geometry  by Grifﬁths  and Harris  published  by  John 
Wiley and Sons, Inc. 
The scheme of  the proof  is  to  ﬁrst  restrict attention  to countable good covers 
which we assume to be co ﬁnal in the set of countable covers. 
The Poincar ´e lemma tells us that that for a contractible open set U 
R �→ �0 (U )  d → �1 (U ) → �2 (U ) → . . . 
d
d
is a long exact sequence. We introduce the notation Z p  for the closed  p­forms so 
Z p (U ) = {θ  ∈ � p (U )|d θ  = 0} 
that 
then we can break up this long exact sequence into short exact sequences. 
0 → Z p (U ) �→ � p (U )  d 
→ Z p+1
(U ) → 0. 
Note that Z 0 (U ) is the constant function so a copy of R. These induce long exact 
sequences in cohomology. 
Hˇ i −1 (M ; � p ) → Hˇ i −1 (M ; Z p+ ) → Hˇ i (M ; Z p ) → Hˇ i (M ; � p ) →

We have seen that  Hˇ i (M ; � p ) = {0} for i  > 0 and hence 
Hˇ i (M ; Z p ) ≡ Hˇ i −1 (M ; Z p+ ) 
1
for i  ≥ 2. Now by de ﬁnition we the  p­th  ˇCech cohomology group of M  is 
Hˇ p (M ; R) = H p (M ; Z
0 ).
Repeated applying the isomorphism above we have 
Hˇ p (M ; R) ≈ H 1 (M ; Z p− ).

Now consider the beginning of the long exact sequence 

→ H 1 (M ; Z p− ) → H 1 (M ; � p ) 
1
0 → H 0 (M ; Z p− ) → H 0 (M ; � p− ) → H 0 (M ; Z p )

which becomes 
0 → Z p− (M ) → � p−1 (M )  d
→ Z p (M ) → H 1 (M ; Z p− ) → 0

Thus 

(M ; R). 
H 1 (M ; Z p− ) ≈ Z p (M )/d� p− (M ) = H p

Thus we have proved that there is a natural isomorphism 
Hˇ p (M ;
R) ≈ H p
(M ; R).
