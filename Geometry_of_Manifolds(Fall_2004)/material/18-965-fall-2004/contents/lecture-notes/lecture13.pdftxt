14  Fiber bundles 

The  notion  of  a  vector  bundle  has  a  natural  and  useful  generalization,  that  of  a 
ﬁber bundle.  Here is a basic example. 
Example 14.1.  A k ­frame for Rn  is a k ­tuple (e1 , . . . , ek ) of linearly independent 
vectors. 
Let  Stk (Rn )  be  the  space  of  all  k ­frames  for  Rn .  This  the  Stiefel  manifold. 
There is a natural map 
p :  Stk (Rn ) → Grk (Rn ) 
given by sending the k ­tuple to (v1 , v2 , . . . , vk ) to its span. This map is a submer­
sion and the preimage of small open sets can be given a product structure. 

Deﬁnition  14.2.  A  (locally  trivial)  ﬁber  bundle  with  ﬁber  F  is  triple  ( E , B , p) 
where  p :  E  →  B  is a smooth map so that for all b  ∈  B  in  B  there is a neighbor­
hood U  of b and a diffeomorphism: 
−1 (U ) → U  × F 
τ :  p
so that  p1  ◦ τ  =  p where  p1 : U  × F  → U  is the projection.

In our example let U�  be one of our standard charts and let  F  =  Inj(Rk , Rn ) 
be the space of injective linear maps. This an open subset of hom(Rk , Rn ) so it is 
a manifold. We’ll deﬁne the inverse of the trivialization 
−1 : U� × F  →  p
−1 (U� ). 
τ 
:  � → Rk . Then 
To do this we need to ﬁx an identiﬁcation of ι 
−1 (� A ,  j ) = ( A ◦ ι ◦  j e1 ), A ◦ ι ◦  j (e2 ), . . . , A ◦ ι ◦  j (ek )). 
τ 
where as usual  A :  � → �⊥  is a linear transformation and � A  is its graph. 
For  another  example  consider  a  real  vector  bundle  p :  E  →  B .  The  projec­
tivization  of  E ,  denoted  P( E )  is  space  of  lines  in  E  and  has  natural  projection 
p � :  P( E ) →  B which is a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber RP n−1 .
