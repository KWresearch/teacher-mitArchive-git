16  A brief introduction to linear analysis 

In a number of place we’ve talked about the so called inﬁnite  dimensional context. 
In  this  section we’ll  introduce  brieﬂy 
the  basic  notions  necessary  to  discuss  this 
story rigorously. The main application we have in mind is to the 

16.1  Basic deﬁnitions 
Deﬁnition  16.1.  A  normed  vector  space  is  a  vector  space  X  (over  the  real  or 
complex numbers) with a function � · � :  X  → R+  satisfying the usual properties 
of a norm. A Banach space is a complete normed vector space that is all sequences 
which are Cauchy with respect to the converge. 
Examples.  C 0 ( X ),  the  space of  continuous  functions on  a  compact metric  space 
is  a  Banach  space  with  its  natural  norm.  Completeness  is  the  statement  that  a 
uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

manifold when given the norm

L p ­spaces. 
Spaces of H ¨older continuous functions. 
Next we wish to consider functions on normed vector spaces.  It turns out that 
continuity of maps on a normed vector space is equivalent to boundedness. More 
precisely we have: 
Deﬁnition  16.2.  A linear map T  :  X  → Y  is called bounded if there is a constant 
C  ≥ 0 so that for all x  ∈  X  we have 
�T x �Y  ≤ C �x � X . 
Furthermore the smallest such constant C  is called the operator norm of T  and is 
denoted �T �.

Exercise:  T  :  X  → Y  is continuous if and only T  is bounded. 
A basic fact of life is that every normed vector space sits in canonical fashion 
in a Banach space. 

Theorem 16.3.  To each normed vector space  X  there corresponds a unique Ba­
nach space  X  called  the completion of  X  and a unique injective map continuous 
linear map X  → X  satisfying the following universal property.  If T  :  X  → Y  is a 
continuous linear map then there is a unique continuous linear map T  :  X  → Y 
so that the operator norm of T  and T  agree. 

For  proof  see  for  example Royden’s  text.  In  practice  the  signiﬁcance  of  this 
theorem is that we will consider various norms on C ∞ (Rn ) and take the comple­
0 
tions with  respect  to  these  norms.  To  check  if maps  between  these  completions 
are continuous it sufﬁces  to check that the map is bounded on C ∞ with respect to 
0 
the norms in question. 
Deﬁnition  16.4.  Let B( X , Y ) denote  the space of bounded  linear operators from 
X  to Y . 
B( X , Y )  is Banach  space  in  its  own  right.  In  fact  it  is  a Banach  algebra  (i.e. 
a  Banach  space  with  the  structure  of  an  algebra  so  that  for  x , y  ∈  X  we  have 
�x y � ≤ �x �� y �
.

16.1.1  The three pillar’s of linear analysis 

You  can  look  in  any  book  on  Functional  analysis  for  this  material.  Its  also  in 
Abraham­Marsden and Ratiu. 
Theorem  16.5.  The  Hahn­Banach  theorem  Let  X  be  a  linear  space  over  F  = 
R orC and  p  :  X  → R be a map satisfying 
1.  For all x , y  ∈ X  p(x + y ) ≤  p(x ) + p( y ) 
2.  For all λ ∈ F and all x  ∈ X  we have  p(λx ) = |λ| p(x ). 
Let  Z  ⊂  X  be a linear subspace and ρ  :  Z  → F be a linear functional.  If for all 
z  ∈  Z  we have |ρ (z )| ≤  p(z ) then there is a linear functional ρ˜ :  X  → F which 
extends ρ  and satisﬁes  ρ (x )| ≤  p(x ) for all x  ∈ X . 
| ˜
The  proof  goes  by  a  Zorn’s  lemma  argument  considering  all  possible  exten­
sions with  the  given  property.  One  shows  that  this  is  a  partially  ordered  set  and 
any extension which is not deﬁned on the whole space has a nontrivial extension. 
This has one corollary that we will need later.

Corollary 16.6.  Let  X  be a Banach  space and  F  ⊂  B  a  ﬁnite  dimensional  sub­
space.  Then  F  has  closed  complementary  subspace.  (i.e.,  there  is  a  closed  sub­
space C  ⊂ B  so that  F ∩ C  = {0} and  F + C  = B . 
Proof.  Take  a  basis  { f 1 , . . . ,  f )n } for  F .  Let  φ1 , . . . , φn  be  the  correspond­
ing  dual  basis  of  F ∗ .  Clearly  the  φi  satisfy  the  hypothesis  of  the  Hahn­Banach 
theorem  with  p  being  a  multiple  of  the  norm.  So  there  are  linear  functionals 
φ˜
1 , . . . , φ˜
n  extending these.  Set C  = ∩ 1 ker(φ˜
n
i =
i ).
Theorem 16.7.  The Open mapping theorem Any surjective bounded linear map­
ping T  :  X  → Y  is an open mapping, that is it takes open sets to open sets. 
The proof of this theorem is an application of the Baire category theorem. 
An important corollary is the Banach isomorphism theorem. 
Theorem 16.8.  The Banach isomorphism theorem A bounded linear map T :  X  → 
Y  which is an isomorphism of vector spaces is a topological isomorphism. 
Proof.  At  issue  is  show  that  T −1  which  exists  as  a  map  of  sets  is  continuous. 
So we must  show  for  all U  ⊂  X  open  that  (T −1 )−1 (U )  =  T (U )  is  open.  T  is 
surjective so this following from the open mapping theorem. 
Theorem  16.9.  The  closed  graph  theorem  A  linear  operator  T :  X  →  Y  is 
bounded if and only if its graph �T  = {(x , T x )|x  ∈ X � ⊂  X × Y  is closed. 

16.2  Compact operators 

In this subsubsection  X  and Y  will denote Banach spaces.

Deﬁnition  16.10.  A  linear operator  T :  X  → Y  is called a compact operator  the

image under T  of the unit ball in  X  has compact closure in Y .

�
Remark 2.  Compact operators are sometime called completely continuous. 

The prototypical compact operator is the following Let  X  and Y  be the space 
∞
�2  of all sequences a = (a1 , a2 , . . .) so that 
(a I )2  ≤ ∞ and deﬁne 
i =
1
T (a1 , a2 , . . .) = (a1 , a2/2, a3/3, . . . , an / n , . . .) 
To  see  that  T  is  compact  choose  a  sequence  a i  in  B1  the  ball  of  radius  one.  By 
a diagonal argument we can pass to a subsequence where components of a i  con­
verge  to  some  a∞ .  Then  we  claim  that  T (a )  converges  in  �2 .  Choose  �  >  0.

Then choose i0  > 0 so that the following hold.

The basic result that we will need is Arzela­Ascoli theorem. Let B be a ball in 
Rn .  Recall we call a subset  A  ∈ C 0 ( B ) equicontinuous if for all �  >  0 there is a 
δ > 0 so that if |x − y | < δ  then | f (x ) −  f ( y )| < �  for all  f  ∈  A. 
Theorem  16.11.  (Arzela­Ascoli).  A  subset  A  ∈  C 0 ( B )  has  compact  closure  in 
C 0 ( B ) if and only if  A is bounded and equicontinuous. 

This has an immediate corollary: 
Corollary 16.12.  The embedding C 1 ( B ) → C 0 ( B ) is compact. 
Proof.  The  unit  ball  in C 0,α ( B )  is  certainly  bounded  in C 0 ( B ).  If  � f �C 0,α  ≤  1 
then | f (x ) −  f ( y )| ≤ |x − y | we can take δ = � .
