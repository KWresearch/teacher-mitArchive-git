19  The Strong Whitney Embedding Theorem 

Whitney proved a stronger version of this theorem. 

Theorem  19.1.  (Whitney  1944)  Any  compact  n ­manifold  admits  an  embedding 
into R2n . 

Proof.  (Sketch). We will work out the case n  is even and n > 2 and M  orientable 
ﬁrst.  Consider the space  I mm  of C k ­immersions of M  → R2n .  The condition of 
being an immersion is an open condition in the C k ­topology on the space of maps 
so  that  I mm  is  a  Banach  manifold.  By  Proposition  15.3  proposition  this  space 
is non­empty.  First we will show  that for a Baire set of  immersions  the  there are 
only  ﬁnitely  many double points  and  that  the  two  sheets of  image  are  transverse 
at the double points. 
To this end consider the map 
F  :  I mm × (M × M  \ �) → Grn (R2n ) × Grn (R2n ) × R2n . 
given by  F ( f , x , y ) = (Im( Dx  f ), Im( D y  f ),  f (x ) −  f (x � ). One checks that  F  is 
a submersion. Let  Z i  ⊂ Grn (R2n ) × Grn (R2n ) be the set of pairs (�1 , �2 ) so that 
dim(�1  ∩ �2 ) = i . 
Lemma 19.2.  Z i  is a smooth submanifold of dimension 2n 2 − i 2 . 
Proof.  Write R2n  as 
�1  ∩ �2 ⊕ �1  ∩ �⊥ ⊕ �⊥ ∩ �2 ⊕ �1  ∩ �⊥

The condition that the planes represented by ( A1 , A2 ) also intersect in an i ­dimensional 
subspace is the condition that α1  = α2  so the total dimension is 2n 2 − i 2 
We  seek  a  map  f  so  that  for  all  distinct  x , y  ∈  M  F ( f , x , y )  �∈  Z i  × {0}
for any i .  The parametric transversality theorem implies that for a Baire set of  f 
the map  (x , y )  �→  F ( f , x , y )  is  transverse  to  Z i  × {0}.  But  the  codimension  of 
Z i  × {0} is 2n 2  + 2n − (2n 2  − i 2 ) =  i 2  + 2n which is larger than the dimension 
of the domain 2n . 
Exercise 8.  Show that we can in addition assume that  f  has no triple points. 
Thus  whenever  f (x )  =  f ( y )  we  have  that  the  differentials  have  transverse 
images at those points.  We assume that in the remainder of the discussion that  f 
has been chosen satisfy these conditions. 
Lemma 19.3.  At each pair (x , x � ) with  f (x ) =  f (x � ) =  y there are charts (U , φ ), 
(U � , φ � ) near x , x �  and (V , ψ ) near  y  so that 
ψ −1  ◦  f  ◦ φ (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , 0, 0, . . . , 0) 

and

ψ −1  ◦  f  ◦ φ � (x1
� , . . . , xn

� ) 
Proof.  Since  f  is  an  immersion  there  are  coordinates φ  =  (x1 , . . . , xn )  about  x 
and ψ1 ( y1 , . . . , y2n ) about  y  so that 
ψ −1  ◦  f  ◦ φ (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , 0, 0, . . . , 0)

and  coordinates  φ � =  (x1

Thus the double points are isolated and hence by compactness there are ﬁnitely 
many. 
the sign of a double point.  Recall now  that are assuming  that 
Next we deﬁne 
n  is  even  and  that  M  is  orientable.  Choose  an  orientation  of  M  and  of  R2n .  If 
f (x ) =  f (x � ) =  y  then transversality tells us that we can write 
Ty R2n  =  Dx  f (Tx M ) ⊕ Dx �  f (Tx � M ). 
As both sides of this equations are oriented vector spaces we can assign a sign to 
the  double  point  according  to whether  or  not  the  orientations  agree.  Notice  that 
since n  is even the order of the factors on the right hand side is immaterial.  Also 
notice that the sign is independent of the choice of orientation of M . 
We will now prove the following key proposition. 
Proposition 19.4.  If a pair of double points y1  and y2  of opposite sign with preim­
� ) and (x2 , x2
� ) respectively.  Then we can modify  f  so as  to eliminate 
ages (x1 , x1
the double point without introducing any others. 
Proof.  Then choose γ  and γ �  embedded smooth curves in M with endpoints x1 , x2 
� , x2
� respectively.  Since  n  >  2 we  can  assume  that  the  curves  are  disjoint 
and  x1
and that their images are disjoint except at the endpoints.  Let �  =  f (γ ) ∪  f (γ � ) 
denote  the  union  of  these  images.  �  is  an  embedded  closed  curve  in  R2n  and 
hence  bounds  a  disk  σ  :  D 2  →  R2n .  We  can  assume  that  σ  is  transverse  to  f 
and to itself. This implies that σ  has no double points and that σ  misses  f  except 
along �. 
Let  N  be  the normal bundle of σ .  Since σ  is contractible  N  is  trivial  so  that 
there is a bundle isomorphism 

N  ≡  D 2 × R2n−2 . 
Let  ν  and  ν �  denote  the  normal  bundles  of  γ  and  γ �  in  M .  These  are  again 
trivial  bundles.  Note  that  along  f (γ ),  D f (ν )  deﬁnes  a  distinguished  subbundle 
similarly along  f (γ � ),  D f (ν � ). 
Notice that the tubular neighborhood of By the tubular neighborhood theorem 
there is a diffeomorphism 

ψ  :  D 2 × D 2n−2  → R2n 
Suppose that we can write  N  = ξ1 ⊕ ξ2  so that 
ξ | f (γ )  =  D f (ν )  and  ξ | f (γ � )  =  D f (ν � ) 

50 

Then we  can write  the  tubular  neighborhood  of  σ  in  a  standard way  and we  see 
since we can push the two dimensional picture till the two arcs don’t intersect we 
can also push the higher dimensional picture till they don’t intersect. 
We must return to the issue of extending the splitting.  The splitting gives rise 
to a map υ  :  �  →  Grn−1 (R2n−2 ) and we must understand when  this map  is null 
homotopic.  Form  algebraic  topology  we  know  that  Grn−1 (R2n−2 )  fundamental 
group Z/2Z and is generated by the family of subspaces 
�t  = span{cos(t )e1 + sin(t )e , e , . . . , en−1 }.

n 
as  t  varies  between  0  and  π .  In  other words  the  identiﬁcation  of �0  with �π  is 
orientation reversing. Thus the orientation of ξ1 ⊕ ξ2  must be the same at the two 
end  if  the splitting  is  to extend.  On  the other hand  the normal vectors  in  the  two 
disk reverse orientation. 

To prove the theorem we need to see that we  ﬁrst  modify  f  so that the signed 
number of double points is zero. To this end consider the map 
(x1 , . . . , xn ) → (x1 − 2x1/u , x2 , . . . , xn , 1/u , x1 x2/u , . . . , x1 xn /u ) 
where u (x1 , . . . , xn ) = (1 + x1
) . . . (1 + xn 
2 )(1 + x2 
2
2
).  It is straightfoward if tedious 
to  check  that  this map  has  exactly  one  double  point  and  also  notice  that  at  very 
large distance from the origin this map is quite close to the linear embedding 

(x1 , . . . , xn , 0, . . . , 0) 
in other words we can shrink the map down a lot and use it to modify a given map 
to have another double point and we can choose the sign of this double points as 
well. 
Now  we  consider  the  case  that  n  is  odd  (it  doesn’t  matter  now  if  M  is  ori­
entable).  Then the sign of a point of  intersection is not well deﬁned. 
In  this case 
however  the  relative  sign of a pair of  intersection points given  the pair of curves 
If the curves γ  joining  x1  and  x2  and γ �  joining  x �
γ  and γ �  is still well deﬁned. 
� lead  to  intersection with  the same sign choose different curves now  joining 
1 
to  x2
� and joining x1
� to x2 . 
x1  to x2
If  M  is  nonorientable  and  we  have  curves  γ  and  γ �  leading  to  a  pair  of  in­
tersection point with  the  same  sign  add  to γ �  a  curve  running  around  a  loop  that 
reverses orientation.
