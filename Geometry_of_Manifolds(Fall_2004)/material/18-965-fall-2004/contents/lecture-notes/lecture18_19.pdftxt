17  Smale’s Sard theorem 
In the early sixties Smales realized that many of the ideas of differential topology 
can be applied to aid in the study of PDEs and as part of this program he showed 
how  to generalize Sard’s  theorem  to  the  inﬁnite  dimensional case.  First we need 
to introduce the correct kind of mappings of Banach manifolds. 
Deﬁnition  17.1.  Let  X  and  Y  be  Banach  manifolds  and  f  :  X  →  Y  a  smooth 
map. We say that  f  is a Fredholm mapping if for all x  ∈  X  the differential 
dx  f  :  Tx X  → T f (x )Y 

is a Fredholm map 

The  ﬁrst  problem  we  run  into  with  trying  generalize  Sard’s  theorem  is  that 
the notion of measure zero  isn’t easy  to make sense of  in an  inﬁnite  dimensional 
space  however  the  the  complement  of  a  (closed)  set  of measure  zero  is  an  open 
dense set.  The critical set of a map is closed so the image is at worst a countable 
union of closed sets of measure zero. The complement is a countable intersection 
of open dense sets.  This notion makes sense in an arbitrary topological space.  In 
particular Banach manifold which  satisﬁes 
the Baire category  theorem  so  such a 
set is non­empty. 
Deﬁnition  17.2.  Let  X  be topological space.  A set  A  ⊂  X  is called residual it is 
a countable intersection of open dense sets. 

Thus the Baire category theorem says that a residual subset of a metric space 
is dense. 
Smale’s generalization of Sard’s theorem is 
Theorem 17.3.  Let  f  :  X  → Y  be a smooth mapping of second countable Banach 
manifolds.  Then the set of regular values of  f  is residual in Y . 

To prove  this result we prove a result of  independent  interest which says  that 
after a change of coordinates a nonlinear Fredholm mapping differs from an linear 
isomorphism by a nonlinear map between  ﬁnite  dimensional manifolds. We have 
a kind of analogue of Lemma ?? 
Lemma 17.4.  Let  f  :  X  → Y  be a Fredholm map.  Then for any x  ∈  X  there are 
coordinate charts φ : U  ⊂  X  →  B ⊕ K  → and ψ :  V  ⊂ Y  →  B ⊕ C  so that 
ψ  ◦  f  ◦ φ−1 (x , k ) = (x , g (x , k )). 

Proof.  This is a local result so we may assume without loss of generality that x  is 
the origin in U¯ ⊂  X  →  B ⊕ K  and that  f (x ) is the origin in V¯ ⊂  Y  →  B ⊕ C 
where  B  is a Banach  space,  K  =  ker(dx  f ),  and C  =  Coker(dx  f ).  We can also

arrange that 0 ⊕ K  is the kernel of d(0,0)  f  and that  B ⊕ {0} is complement for the

range of d(0,0)  f  and ﬁnally that

Write 

f (x , k ) = (a (x , k ), b(x , k )). 
As in the proof of the implicit function theorem consider the map 
h  : U  →  B ⊕ K 

given by 

h (x , k ) = (a (x , k ), k ). 
Then  the differential of  h  at  (0, 0)  is  the  identity  so  there  is  a map q  inverting  h 
near the origin. Notice that 

f  ◦ q (x , k ) = (x , g (x , k )) 

as required. 

Remark  3.  This  lemma  has  a  very  important  consequence.  Point  preimages  of 
Fredholm mappings are locally homeomorphic to the point preimage of a smooth 
map  between  ﬁnite  dimensional  manifolds.  This  the  beginning  of  Kuranishi’s 
work  in  deformation  theory  for  complex manifolds.  Kuranshi  and  Smale where 
contemporaries at Columbia in the early sixties. 
We need one more technical lemma. 
Deﬁnition  17.5.  A map  f  :  X  →  Y  is  said  to be  locally  closed  if  for  all  x  ∈  X 
¯
there is a neighborhood U  of x  so that  f |U¯ : U t oY  is a closed map. 
Any continuous map  from a  locally compact space  is  locally closed.  Banach 
spaces a locally compact if and only if they are ﬁnite dimensional. 
Lemma 17.6.  A Fredholm map  f  :  X  → Y  is locally closed.

Proof.  Choose  charts  as  guaranteed  by  Lemma  17.4  so  that  we  can  assume  our 
map has the form 
f (x , k ) = (x , g (x , k )) 
If  A ⊂ U  ⊂  B × K  is closed we must show that  f ( A) is closed.  Let (x i , ci ) be a 
sequence in  f ( A) converging to (x , c). Then ci  = g (x i , yi ) for some sequence yi . 
Since the  yi  are bounded in ﬁnite  dimensional vector space we can assume that  yi 
converge. Then clearly (x , c) will be in  f ( A). 

We are now ready to prove Smale’s Sard theorem. 
Proof.  Let  f  :  X  →  Y  be our Fredholm map.  Since  X  is  second  countable  it  is 
enough  to  show  that  there  is  a  covering  of  X  by  open  sets U  so  that  the  regular 
values  of  f |U  are  residual.  In  fact we will  show  that we  can  ﬁnd  U  so  that  the 
regular values of  f |U  are open and dense.  Since  f  is locally closed and the since 
the critical point set of  f  is closed there in no problem in choosing U  the regular 
values of  f |U  is  an open  set  .  Now  choose  charts  about  the point  in question  so 
that  the  local  representative  of  f  has  the  form  guaranteed  by  Lemma  17.4.  The 
� 
� 
differential of local representative of  f  has the form 
0 
I 
∗  d(x ,k ) g |
K
so  that  d(x ,k )  f  is  surjective  if  and  only  if  d(x ,k ) g |K  is  surjective  in  other  words 
(x , c) is a regular value for  f |U  if and only if c  is a regular value of k  �→  g (x , k ) 
for k  in a suitable neighborhood. Thus the intersection of R( f |U ) with each slice 
{x } × C ∩ V  is dense and hence R( f |U ) is dense.
