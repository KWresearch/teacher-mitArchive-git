15  Whitney’s embedding theorem, medium version. 

Theorem  15.1.  (Whitney).  Let  X  be  a  compact  n ­manifold.  Then  M  admits  a 
embedding in R2n+1 . 

Proof.  From Theorem [?] we can assume that M  is embedded in R N  for some N . 
To  state  the  next  result  for  a  hyperplane �  ⊂  R N  let  p� :  R N  →  �  denote  the 
orthogonal projection. Note that the set of hyperplanes in R N  is a copy of RP N −1 
by associating to each hyperplane the orthogonal line.  The desired result follows 
from: 
Lemma 15.2.  If  N  > 2n + 1 then for a full measure set of hyperplanes � ⊂ R N 
the composition  p�  ◦ � is a differentiable embedding of M  into �. 
Proof.  Let � ⊂  M × M  be the diagonal, � = {(x , x )|x  ∈  M }. Deﬁne the map 
a  :  M × M  \ � → RP N −1 . 
which  sends distinct points  x  and  x �  to  the  line  through  the origin parallel  to  the 
line passing through x  and x �  or equivalently the line through 0 and x − x � . Notice 
that  p�  ◦ � is injective if and only if a misses the line orthogonal to �.  If 2n  <

N  − 1  then  any  point  in  the  image  of  a  is  a  critical  value  and  hence  by  Sard’s 
theorem  the  image of has measure zero.  Thus  the  set of  then  the  image of a  has 
measure zero and so  the set of hyperplane for which  the composition  is  injective 
is a Baire set. 
Next consider the projectivization of the tangent bundle of M , P(T M ). This is 
a ﬁber  bundle over M with ﬁber  RPn−1 . The total space of the bundle is a smooth 
manifold of dimension 2n − 1. Deﬁne the map 
b  : P(T M ) → RP N −1 
which sends a line � ∈ Tx M  to the line Dx �(�) in R N . Notice that the differential 
of  p�  ◦ � is injective precisely when the line orthogonal to � is not in the image 
of b.  If 2n − 1 <  N  − 1 then as above the image of b has full measure. 
Thus the set of good planes is the intersection of two sets of full measure and 
hence had full measure itself. 

Notice  that  the condition on  the map b was weaker  then  the condition on  the 
map a  so the proof also proves: 
Proposition 15.3.  If M  is a closed smooth n ­manifold then M  immerses into R2n . 

Proof. 

We’ll use this theorem to prove the hard version of Whitney’s theorem.
