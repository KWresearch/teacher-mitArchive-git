29  The immersion theorem of Smale 

Let  Imm( X , Y )  denote  the  space  of  immersion  of  X  into  Y .  Fixing  base  points 
x  ∈  X  and  y  ∈ Y  and an injection ξ  : Tx X  → Ty Y .  let Imm∗ ( X , Y ) be the space 
of base point preserving immersions in the sense that 
f (x ) =  y , 
dx  f  = ξ . 
Let  Imm1 ( X , Y )  denote  the  space  of  pair  ( f ,  f � )  where  f  :  X  →  Y  is  an 
immersion  and  f �  is  a  section  of  f ∗ (T Y )  →  X  with  the  property  that  f 
� (x )  � 
Ran(dx  f ) and let Imm1 ∗ ( X , Y ) denote the based version.  Here is the proof of the 
covering homotopy property of the natural map 
π  : Imm( D k , Rn ) → Imm1 ( S k−1 , Rn ) 
f  | S k−1 ). 
where π ( f ) = ( f | S k−1 , ∂
∂ n
The  idea of  the proof  is  the  following.  The  condition of being an  immersion 
is  open  and  there  is  certainly  a  section  of  π  (indeed  linear)  if  we  disregard  the 
immersion  condition  so  we  can  alway  lift  a  given  a  homotopy  for  a  short  time 
where the time depends on how close to failing to be an immersion the time zero 
lift  is and on how big  the derviatives of  the  section are.  Smale’s  trick  is morally 
to essentially homotope the time zero lift to be very much inside the space of im­
mersion.  Then he can lift the homotopy a  ﬁxed  amount along the time parameter
