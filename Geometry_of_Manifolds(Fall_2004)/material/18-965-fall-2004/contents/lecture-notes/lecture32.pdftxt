25.2  The Poincar ´e lemma and homotopy invariance of the DeR­
ham cohomology 

There are a bunch of basic forumlas in dealing with forms, the exterior derivative 
and contraction and the Lie derivative. 
Recall that the Lie derivative is deﬁned  as follow. Given a vector ﬁeld  v  let  Ft 
be its time t  ﬂow.  By pull back this acts on forms on the manifold.  Fixing a point 
x  ∈  X  we can watch what happens to the a form at the point x  under the  ﬂow, 
i.e 
consider the path 
∗ (ω Ft (x ) ) ∈ �
k
( X ) 
Ft 
x
The derivative at t  = 0 is called the Lie derivative 
∗ (ω Ft (x ) )|t =0  ∈ �k
Lv ω = 
d 
Ft

d t 
More  generally  there  is  a  Lie  derivative  on  tensors.  Note  that  if  f  is  a  function 
then this deﬁnition amounts to nothing more that 
f  ◦ Ft (x )t =0  = v f (x ) = ιv d f 
Lv  f  = 

d 
d t 
Since  the exterior derivative  is natural under diffeomorphisms  it  follows  that Lie 
derivative commutes with d . Hence 
Lv d f  = d Lv  f  = d ιv d f .

More generally we have Cartan’s formula or the homotopy formula. 
ω = d ιv ω + ιv d ω . 
Lv 
We  prove  this  by  induction  on  the  degree  of  the  form.  We  have  checked  the 
case  of  functions.  Furthermore  it  is  enough  to  check  that  that  both  sides  satisfy 
the Leibniz rule. 

Lv (ω ∧ η) = Lv (ω ∧ η) = d ιv ω + ιv d ω . 
Let i  :  M  → R × M  be the inclusion i (x ) =  (0, x ) and let π  : R × M  →  M 
be the projection. We claim that the induced maps on cohomology are inverses of 
each other. Thus we have 
Proposition 25.4.  The groups  H ∗ (M ) and  H ∗ (R × M ) are isomorphic. 
To prove this we will construct a map K

26  Cech cohomology 
Let U = {Uα |α  ∈  A}be a open cover of a topological space.  Using the combina­
torics of the cover when can deﬁne  a complex as follows. Let C p (U) be the space 
of all locally constant functions on  p + 1 fold intersections 
Uα0  ∩ . . . ∩ Uα p 
with the symmetry property that if σ  is a permutation of 0, . . . , p  then 
f |Uα0  ∩ . . . ∩ Uα p  = sign(σ ) f |Uασ (0)  ∩ . . . ∩ Uασ ( p)
We write  fα0 ...α p  for  f |Uα0  ∩ . . . ∩ Uα p 
There is a natural codifferential on such functions 
δ  : C p (U) → C p+1 (U)

If  we  order  A  then  we  can  consider  only  ordered  intersections  and  deﬁne  a 
similary complex which has isomorphic cohomology.  In practice this is how one 
work but the ﬁrst deﬁnition is choice free so a bit prefereable. 
Example.  Think of  S 2  as  the boundary of  tetrahedron.  Cover  S 2  by  the  four 
open which are the complements of the four closed two dimensional faces.  If we 
label these sets U1 , U2 , U3 , U4  then the non empty two fold intersections are 
U1  ∩ U2 , U1  ∩ U3 , U1 , ∩U4 , U2  ∩ U3 , U2  ∩ U4 , U3  ∩ U4 . 
and the non­empty three fold intersections are 
U1  ∩ U2  ∩ U3 , U1  ∩ U2  ∩ U4 , U1  ∩ U3  ∩ U4 , U2  ∩ U3  ∩ U4 
the four­fold intersection is empty. 
Then all interections are connected and the complex is 
R4  �→ R6  �→ R4 

with the maps 

δ0 ( f 1 ,  f 2 ,  f 3 ,  f 4 ) = ( f 1 −  f 2 ,  f 1 −  f 3 ,  f 1 −  f 4 ,  f 2 −  f 3 ,  f 2 −  f 4 ,  f 3 −  f 4 )  (8) 
and 
δ1 ( f 12 ,  f 13 ,  f 14 ,  f 23 ,  f 24 ,  f 34 ) = ( f 23− f 13+ f 12 ,  f 24− f 14+ f 12 ,  f 34− f 14+ f 13 ,  f 34− f 24+ f 23 ) 
(9) 
The  kernel  of  δ0  is  clearly  the  constant  functions.  Cokernel  of  δ1  is  one  dimen­
sional and hence we have  Hˇ ∗ (U) = R, 0, R.
