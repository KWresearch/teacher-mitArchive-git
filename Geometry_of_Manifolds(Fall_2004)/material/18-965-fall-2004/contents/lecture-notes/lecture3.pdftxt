4  The derivative of a map between vector spaces 
Let  f  : V  → W  be a smooth map between real vector spaces. 
Deﬁnition  4.1.  Given x  ∈ V  we say that  f  is differentiable at x  if there is a linear 
map  L x  :  V  → W  so that for all v  ∈ V  we have: 
��).
)� = o(�x − x 
� f (x ) −  f (x 
� ) − L x (x − x 
�
Here we using the Landau symbol o to mean a function o :  R+ → R continu­
ous at zero and o(0) = 0. 
Really  this  is an  improper deﬁnition.  We  really need  V  and W  to be normed 
vector  spaces  and  it  is  natural  to  require  that  L  is  a  continuous  linear map.  One 
can try to develop differential calculus on manifolds modelled on general topolog­
ical vector  spaces.  A  sufﬁciently  general  context  to work  in  is  that of manifolds 
modelled on Banach spaces, that is complete normed linear spaces. Essentially of 
the basic results in differential topology work in this context with the same proofs 
(as long as proof don’t use coordinates) 
Notice that map L  in the above deﬁnition is  unique.  If L �  is another such map 
then 
o(�x − x

� ) − L (x − x 
� ) − L

= �( L − L
� )(x − x 
� )�

So ( L − L � )(x − x � ) = 0. 
The map  L  is called the differential of  f  at x  and is denoted 

� (x − x 
� ))�

dx  f  or Dx  f . 
We say  f  is differentiable if  f  is differentiable at each x  ∈ U  and is continuously 
differentiable if 
d f  : U  → hom(V , W ). 
is  continuous.  The  second  derivative  is  the  derivative  of  the  ﬁrst  derivative  and 
thus is a map 
d 2  f  : U  → hom(V , hom(V , W )).

In the  ﬁnite  dimensional case hom(V , hom(V , W )) with a subspace of hom(V  ⊗ 
V , W )  .  In  the  in ﬁnite  dimensional  case we  need  to  be more  careful  but we  can 
identify hom(V , hom(V , W )) with bilinear maps from 
V  → W .

Deﬁnition  4.2.  A smooth map  f  :  X  → Y  is called an immersion its differential 
is  everywhere  injective.  It  is  called  a  submersion  if  it  differential  is  everywhere 
surjective. 

There obvious examples of such maps.  Suppose m  < n  are positive integers 
i  : Rm  → Rn 

given by 

i (x 1 , . . . , xm ) = (x 1 , . . . , xm , 0, . . . , 0) 
is an immersion while 
s  : Rn  → Rm 
s (x , . . . , xm , xm+1 , . . . , xn ) = (x , . . . , xm )

is a submersion. We will see in the next section that locally these simple examples 
are completely general.
