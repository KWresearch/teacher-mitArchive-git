1  Manifolds:  deﬁnitions and examples 

Loosely manifolds  are  topological  spaces  that  look  locally  like Euclidean  space. 
A  little more  precisely  it  is  a  space  together  with  a way  of  identifying  it  locally 
with  a  Euclidean  space  which  is  compatible  on  overlaps.  To  formalize  this  we 
need the following notions.  Let  X  be a Hausdorff, second countable,  topological 
space. 
Deﬁnition  1.1.  A chart is a pair (U , φ ) where U  is an open set in  X  and φ  : U  → 
Rn  is  homeomorphism  onto  it  image.  The  components  of φ  =  (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) 
are called coordinates. 

Given two charts (U1 , φ1 ) and (U2 , φ2 ) then we get overlap or transition maps 
φ2  ◦ φ−1 : φ1 (U1  ∩ U2 ) → φ2 (U1  ∩ U2 )
1 

and 

φ1  ◦ φ−1 : φ2 (U1  ∩ U2 ) → φ1 (U1  ∩ U2 )
2 

Deﬁnition  1.2.  Two charts (U1 , φ1 ) and (U2 , φ2 ) are called compatible if the over­
lap maps are smooth. 

In practice it is useful to consider manifolds with other kinds of regularity. One 
many consider C k ­manifolds where the overlaps are C k ­maps with C k  inverses.  If 
we only require the overlap maps to be homeomorphisms we arrive at the notion 
of a topological manifold.  In some very important work of Sullivan one consider 
Lipschitz, or Quasi­conformal manifolds.

An atlas for  X  is a (non­redundant) collection A = {(Uα , φα )|α  ∈  A} of pair 
wise compatible charts . Two atlases are equivalent if there their union is an atlas. 
An atlas A is called maximal if any other atlas compatible with it is contained in 
it. 
Exercise  1.  Using  Zorn’s  lemma,  show  that  any  atlas  is  contained  in  a  unique 
maximal atlas.

Deﬁnition  1.3.  A smooth n ­dimensional manifold  is a Hausdorff,  second count­
able, topological space  X  together with an atlas, A. 

1.1  examples 
Rn  or any open subset of Rn  is a smooth manifold with an atlas consisting of one 
� 
chart. The unit sphere 
n
S n  = {(x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x n )| 
(x i )2  = 1}
i =0 
has an atlas consisting of two charts (U± , φ± ) where U± =  S n \{(±1, 0, 0, . . . , 0)}
and 

φ± (x 0 , x , . . . , x n ) = ±1
1 − x0 
(x 1 , . . . , x n )

Real  projective  space,  RPn ,  is  space  of  all  lines  through  the  origin  in  Rn+1 
which we  can  identify with  nonzero  vectors  up  to  the  action  of  non­zero  scalars 
so  RPn  =  (Rn+1  \ {0�})/R∗ .  The  equivalence  class  of  (x0 , . . . , xn )  is  denoted 
[x0 :  x1 :  . . .  :  xn ]. RPn  has an atlas consisting of n + 1 charts. The open sets are 
Ui  = {[x0 :  x1 :  . . .  :  xn ]|x j  ∈ R,  and xi  �= 0} 
and the corresponding coordinates are 
φi ([x0 :  x1 :  . . .  :  xn ]) = (x1/x i , . . . , x i /x i , . . . , xn /x i ).

Similarly we have complex projective space, CPn , the space of a line through 
the origin in Cn+1 .  So just as above we have CPn  =  (Cn+1  \ {0�})/C∗ .  A typical 
point  of CPn  is written  [z 0 :  z 1 :  . . .  :  z n ].  CPn  has  a  atlas  consisting  of  n + 1 
charts. The open sets are 
Ui  = {[z 0 :  z 1 :  . . .  :  z n ]|z i  �= 0} 
φi ([z 0 :  z 1 :  . . .  :  z n ]) = (z 1/z i , . . . , z�i /z i , z n /z i ). 
and the corresponding coordinates are 

.

Exercise 2.  Show that in fact the above construction yield charts. 
Notice that in the case of CPn  the coordinates have values in Cn  and so the overlap 
maps map an open subset of Cn  to Cn . We can ask that they are holomorphic. We 
make the following deﬁnition. 

Deﬁnition  1.4.  A complex manifold is a Hausdorff second countable topological 
= 
{(Uα , φα )|α  ∈  A  the  coordinate  functions  φα  take 
space  X ,  with  an  atlas  A 
values in Cn  and so all the overlap maps are holomorphic.

Let Grk (Rn ) be the space of k ­planes through the origin in Rn . 
Exercise  3.  Show  that Grk (Rn )  has  an  atlas with  k  charts  each  homeomorphic 
n
with Rk (n−k ) . 
Similarly we have Grk (Cn ) the space of all complex k ­plane through the origin 
�  � 
in Cn . 
Exercise  4.  Show  that Grk (Cn )  has  an  atlas with  k  charts  each  homeomorphic 
n
with Ck (n−k ) . Show that we can give Grk (Cn ) the structure of a complex manifold.
