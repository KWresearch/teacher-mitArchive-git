Let V  be a ﬁnite  dimensional vector space over the reals. The tensor algebra of V 
is direct sum 
⊗2 . . . ⊕ V 
Ten(V ) = R ⊕ V  ⊕ V 
⊗k  . . . 
It  is made  into  an  algebra by declaring  that  the product of a  ∈  V ⊗k  and b  ∈ 
V ⊗l  is a ⊗ b ∈ V ⊗(k+l ) . It is characterized by the universal mapping property that 
any linear map V  →  A where  A  is an algebra over R extends to a unique map of 
algebras Ten(V ) →  A. 
The exterior algebra algebra is the quotient of exterior algebra by the relation 
v ⊗ v = 0. 
The  exterior  algebra  is  denoted  �∗ (V )  or  �(V ).  It  is  customary  to  denote  the 
multiplication in the exterior algebra by (a , ) → a ∧ b If v1 . . . vk  is a basis for V 
then this relation is equivalent to the relations 

i  �= 

j ,

for 

. . . vi k 

vi  ∧ v j  = −v j  ∧ vi 
vi  ∧ vi  =  0 
Thus �∗ (V ) has basis the products 
vi1  ∧ vi2 
where the indices run over all strictly increasing sequences of numbers between 1 
�  � 
and n . 
1 ≤ i i  < i2  <  . . . < i k  ≤ n . 
n
such sequences of length k we have
k 
dim(�∗ (V )) = 2n . 
�∗ (V ) since the relation is homogenous the grading of the tensor algebra descends 
to a grading on the exterior algebra (hence the *). 
We can apply this construction  ﬁberwise 
to a vector bundle.  The most impor­
tant example is the cotangent bundle of a manifold T ∗ X  in which case we get the 
bundle of differential forms 

Since for each k  there are 

�∗ (T 
∗ X )  or  �∗ ( X ).

We will denote  the space of smooth sections of �∗ ( X ) by �∗ ( X ).  In  local coor­
� 
dinates a typical element of �∗ ( X ) looks like 
ω = 
ωi i i2 ...<i k d x i1  ∧ d x i2  ∧ . . . d x i k . 
1≤i i <i2<...<i k ≤n 
Since the construction of �∗ ( X ) was functorial in the cotangent bundle these 
bundles  naturally  pull  back  under  diffeomorphism  and  if  f  :  X  →  Y  is  any 
smooth map there is natural map 
∗  : �∗ (Y ) → �∗ ( X ).

Notice that we can’t invariantly deﬁne  a similar operator on the tensor algebra.

Thus  our  deﬁnition  depends  on  the  choice  of  coordinates.  Notice  that when we 
pass to the exterior algebra this last expression vanishes that exterior derivative is 
well deﬁned.
