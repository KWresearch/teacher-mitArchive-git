8  Connections 

We motivate the introduction of connections in a vector bundle as a generalization 
of the usual directional derivative of functions on a manifold. Given a vector ﬁeld 
X  and a  function  f  on a manifold  M ,  its directional derivative  is a new  function 
as in equation (2). Thus we have a map 
∞ (M ; T M ) × C

∞ (M ) → C

∞ (M ). 

C

This map has the following properties. 

X ( f g ) =  f X g + g X f 
(α X + β Y ) f  = α X f  + β Y f

where  X  and Y  are smooth vector ﬁelds and α,  β ,  f  and g are smooth functions. 
If we  try  to  generalize  this  to  a  directional  derivative  on  sections  of  a  vector 
bundle we would like a map 
∞ (M ; T M ) × C

∞ (M ; E ) → C

∞ (M ; E ). 

C

This map is using denoted 

( X , s )  �→ � X s 
We can no longer multiply sections of a vector bundle but we can multiply sections 
of  a  vector  bundle  by  functions.  The  appropriate  generalization  of  the  two  rules 
about are 

� X  f s  =  f � X s + ( X f )s 
�α X +
β Y s  = α� X s + β�Y f

9  Partitions of unity 
Given an open cover, {Uα |α  ∈  A} of a topological space X we say that a collection 
of function βα :  X  → R≥0  is a partition of unity if 
1.  For all α  ∈  A Support(βα ) ⊂ Uα 
2.  The  collection  {Support(βα )|α  ∈  A}  is  locally  ﬁnite, 
that  is  to  say  for  all 
x  ∈  X  there is a neighborhood of x  meeting only ﬁnitely  many of members 
of the collection. 
3.  For all x  ∈  X  we have  � 
βα (x ) = 1. 
α∈ A 

Smooth manifolds have smooth partitions of unity. 

10  The Grassmanian is universal 

We  say  that bundle  is of  ﬁnite  type  if  there  is  a  ﬁnite  set of  trivializations whose 
open sets cover.  In this section we will prove the following theorem. 
Theorem 10.1.  Let  E  →  M  be a vector bundle of  ﬁnite  type.  Then  for  some  N 
large enough there is a map 

f  :  M  → Grk (R N ). 

Proof.  Let  {(Ui , τi )|i  =  1, . . . m } be a collection of  trivializations  so  that  the Ui 
cover.  Write  the  trivializations  as  τi (e)  =  ( p(e), φi (e))  as  before.  Choose  a 
partition of unity {βi |i  = 1, . . . , m } subordinate to the Ui . Then deﬁne 
� :  E  → Rm k 

by the formula 
�(e) = (β1 ( p(e))φ1 (e), β2 ( p(e))φ2 (e), . . . , βm ( p(e))φm (e)). 
� is well deﬁned  by the support condition on the partition of unity. � is linear on 
each  ﬁber  of  E  as  the  φi  are.  �  is  injective  on  each  ﬁber  since  for  each  b  ∈  B

there is a βi  with βi (b) = 0. Thus for each point b ∈  B we have that �−1 ( p−1 (b)) 
is a k ­plane in Rm k .  So we can now deﬁne 
f  :  B → Grk (Rm k ) 

by 

f (b) = �( p
−1 (b)). 
Exercise 6.  Check that this map is smooth.  In other words write the map down in 
charts on the domain and range. 
We claim that  f ∗ (γk ) is isomorphic to  E . Consider the map 
˜
� :  E  →  B × γk

given by 

˜
�(e) = ( p(e), (�( p
−1 ( p(e))), �(e))).
f  this maps  E  to  f ∗ (γk ). 
From the deﬁnition of 
Exercise 7.  Check that this is an isomorphism.
