R  is   a  C 2  map   with  uniformly  bouned  ﬁrst  and 
Exercise  1.  Let  F 
second  derivatives.  F  induces  a  map 
˜F  :  C 0 [0,  1]  → C 0 [0,  1] 
�→ F (u(t))   Show   that  F˜ is   a  C 1  map.

by  composition;  F (u)  is  the  function  t 
More  generally  let  given  a  Banach   space  B  let   B 0  =  C 0 ([0,  1],  B ) be  the  be 
space  of  contiuous  maps  from  [0,  1]  to  B .  Show  that  B 0  is   a  Banach  space.  If

B  is  a  C 2  map  with  uniformly  bounded  ﬁrst  and  second  derivatives, 
F  :  B
˜
then  the   map  induced  by  composition  F  is   C 1 
Exercise  2.  Let  A  :  B  →  B  be  a  bounded  linear  operator.  Consider  the 
linear  ODE  in  a   Banach  space 

du 
dt 

+  Au  = 0 

with  the  intial   condition  u(0)   =  v .  First  show  that  the  solution   is  given  by 
e−tA  v 
where  the  time  dependent  operator  e−tA   is   deﬁned  by  showing  the  usual  
power  series  for  the  expotential  is  convergent  in   the  Banach   space  of  bounded 
linear  operator   from  B  to  itself.  Let  B 0  =  C 0 ([0,  �],  B ) and  B 1  =  C 1 ([0,  �],  B ).  
Then  we  can  view  the  diﬀerntial  equation  as   giving  rise  to  a  map 
L  :  B 1  → B 0  × B 

where 

du 
L(u)   = (  Au,  u(0)).

Show  that  L  is  invertible  and   indeed  its  inverse  is  given  by  the  familiar  
formula

Exercise  3.  The  exercise   uses  the   previous   one  to  prove  the  existence  and 
uniqueness  theorem  for   ﬁrst  order   ordinary  diﬀerential  equations.  Let  B  be 
→
B  be  a  C 2  map   with  bounded   derivaitves. 
a  Banach  space  and   let  X  :  B
We  seek  a  solution  to  the  diﬀerntial  question

+  X (u)  = 0 

sub ject  to  the  initial   condition  u(0)   =  v .  Let   B 0  =  C 0 ([0,  �],  B )  and  B 1  = 
C 1 ([0,  �],   B ).  Then  we  can  view  the  diﬀerntial   equation   as   given   rise  to   a 
map 
F  :  B 1  → B 0  × B 

where 

du 
F (u) = (  +  X (u),  u(0)). 
dt 
Assuming  the  ﬁrst  exercise   show  that   this  a  C 1  map.  Show  that  The   diﬀer­
ential  at   0  is  the  map 

du 
D0F (u) = (   +  D0X (u),  u(0))  
dt 

which  by  the  second   exercise  is  invertible.  Conclude  from  the  this   and   the  
inverse  function  theorem  the   existence  and   unique  ness   theorem. 
Exercise  4.  Suppose  that  V  → X  is   given  as  a  subbundle  of the  trivial  bundle 
X  × Rn  →  X  via   a  family  of  pro jections  Π.  Then  the  induced  connection 
is  Π  ◦ d  where  d  denotes  the  ordinary  derviative.   Given   a  local  basis   for  V 
ﬁnd  the  connection   matrix  for  the  connection.  Use  this  formula  to  ﬁnd  a 
→
CPn  be  the  tautogical   bundle. (The  tautological 
connection  matrix  for  γ 
bundle  sits  inside  the  trivial  Cn+1  bundle.)
