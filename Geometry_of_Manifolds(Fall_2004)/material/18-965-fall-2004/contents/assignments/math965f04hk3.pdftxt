Exercise  1.  Prove  Riesz’s  lemma.  The  unit   ball   in  a  Banach   space  is  compact 
if  and  only  if  the  Banach  space  is  ﬁnite  dimensional. 

Exercise  2.  Prove  that  the  adjoint   of   a  compact   operator   is   compact.  Prove 
that  if  K  :  X  →  Y 
→ 
Z  is   bounded  then  T K   is
:  Y
is  compact  and  T 
compact. 

Exercise  3.  Let  L2 (S 1 )  be  the  set   of   square  integrable  functions   on   the  unit 
1 (S 1 )  be  the  set   of   functions   so  that   f  and  f �  are  square 
circle  and  let  L2 
→
integrable.   Show  that   the  inclusion   L2 
1 (S 1 )  � L2 (S 1 )  is   compact.

Hint:   Let  f  ∈ L2 (S 1 )  then  we  can   expand   f  in   a  Fourier  series;
