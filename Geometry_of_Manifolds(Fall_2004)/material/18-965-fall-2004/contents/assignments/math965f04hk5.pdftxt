Exercise  1.  Let  M  be   smooth  manifold   embedded   in   RN  .  Show  that  for  a 
residual  subset  of  the  dual   space  of  RN  the  restriction  on   a  linear  functional 
to  M  is  a  Morse  function.  

Exercise  2.  Show  that  every  Morse  function   on   a  closed  orientable  2  dimen­
sional  manifold  of   genus  g  has  at  least  2g  +  2  critial  points.  
Exercise  3.  Show  that  the  space   of  n  × n  symmetric  matrices  with   at   least  
one  eigenvalue  of  multiplicity  greater   than  one  is   a  stratiﬁed  space  with   the 
stratum  stratum  of  larget  dimension   being  of  codimension  three. 

Exercise  4.  Show   that  every  real  vector   bundle  ξ  of  rank  k  over  a  manifold 
X  of  dimension  d  can  be  pulled   back  from  the  grassmanian 
Grk (Rk+d ).  

Hint:  If  ξ  is  pulled  back   then  there  is  a   ﬁberwise  injective  map 
�k+d → 

ξ

Use  parameteric  transeversality  to  ﬁnd  the  codimension  of  the  set   where  a 
ﬁberwise  linear  map 
�k+d → 

ξ

is  not  of  full  rank.
