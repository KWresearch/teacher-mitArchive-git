This  deﬁnes  a   function  on  the   pro jective  space  CPn  .  Find  the  critical   points   of 
this  function  and   compute   their   indices.  Use  the  Morse  complex  to  compute 
the   homology   of  CPn  .

Exercise  2.  Find  a   good  cover   of  a  surface  of  genus  g and  compute  the  Cˇ ech  
cohomology  of  this  cover.  

Exercise  3.  Prove  the  following  formulae  where  α and  β are  forms  and   v  and 
w  are  vector  ﬁelds.
