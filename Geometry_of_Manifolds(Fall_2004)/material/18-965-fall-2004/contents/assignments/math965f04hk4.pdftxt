Exercise  1.  Proof  that  the  evaluation   map 
ev  :  C k (M , Rn ) → 

Rn 

is  C 1  and  that  it  is  a   submersion. 
Exercise  2.  Prove  that  there  is  an  immersion  of  T 2  \ {pt}  into  R2  .  Prove 
that  there  is  an  immersion  of  T n  \ {pt}  into  Rn  .  (This  is  Exercise  2  pg  27  of 
Hirsch’s  “Diﬀerential  Topology.”)  
Exercise  3.  An  s­fold  point  of  a  map  f  :  M  → Rn  is   a  point   x  ∈ M  so  that  
there  are  s  distinct  points  x  =  x1 , .  .  .  xs  so  that  

f (x1 ) =  .  .  .  =  f (xs ).  

Let  M  and  N  be   manifolds  whose  dimensions  satisfy 
s  +  1/s  <  n/ dim  M  <  s/s  − 1 
Show  that  there  is  a   residual  set   in   C k (M , Rn )  so  the  set  of  s +  1­fold  points 
is  empty  and  the  set  of  s­fold  points   is  a  smooth  submanifold   of  dimension 
ms − (s − 1)n. (This  is  derived  from  Exercise  7  pg  27  of  Hirsch’s   “Diﬀerential 
Topology.”)
