Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions must be  written up   independently.  It is  illegal to  consult  materials from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

Write  the  names   of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and  the  
resources   you  used. 

Problem  1.  (immediately,  8  points:  2+1+1+2+2) 
In 3D  computer  graphics,  one  needs to  represent  3-dimensional ob jects on a plane   screen, 
by  drawing  a  given  point  P  at  the   place  where  the   line   from  P  to  the   eye  meets  the   screen. 
Suppose  that  the  screen   is  the  yz -plane,  and  the   eye  is  at  E  : (2, 0, 0). 
a) At  what point  Q : (y , z ) in   the yz -plane   should  one  represent  the point  P  : (x0 , y0 , z0 )? 
(Express   y  and  z  in   terms  of  the  coordinates  of  P .  Assume  that  x0  <  2.  Why  is  this 
assumption  legitimate?) 

b)  What  does  the  image  on  the   screen  of  a  line   segment  in  space   look  like?  (Justify your 
answer.) 
c)  A  line  segment  connects  P0  : (−1, −3, 1)  to  P1  : (−2, 4, 6).  What  is  drawn  on   the  
screen? 
d)  A  bird  leaves  from  P0  at  time  t =  0,  and  ﬂies  in  a  straight  line   at  constant  speed  in 
such  a  way  that  it  passes  through  P1  at  time  t  =  1.  What  does  the   tra jectory  of  the   bird  
(for   t ≥  0)  look  like  on  the  screen?  Show  that,  as  t  tends  to  inﬁnity,  the   tra jectory  on   the  
screen   tends to a  limit point (the “vanishing point”), and give its coordinates. 

e)  In  fact,   part  of  the  tra jectory  of  the   bird   is  hidden  by  a  vertical  fence  erected  in  front 
of   the  observer.  The  fence  lies  in   the  plane   x =  1,  and  its  top   is  at  the   altitude  z =  1.  What 
portion  of  the  tra jectory  is  hidden? 
Hint:  observe  that  the  points  hidden  by  the   fence  are  exactly  those  which  lie   below  a 
certain   plane  passing  through   E . 

Problem  2.  (Tuesday,  4  points:  3+1) 
a)   Let  w =  xy  (=  ey ln x ).  Give  an   approximate  formula  for  the   small  change  Δw  in  the  
value  of  w  produced   by  small   changes  Δx  and Δy  in  the   values  of  x  and  y .  Use  this  to 
calculate  an  approximate  value  of  1.982.01 .  Compare  your  answer  with  the   exact  value. 
b)  Starting  from  22  =  4,  is  the  value   of  x more  sensitive  to  small  changes  in  x  or  in  the  
y
exponent  y?  (Justify  your  answer.)

Problem  3.  (Tuesday,  7  points:   2+2+0+3) 
The  ﬁgure  below  is  the  contour  plot  of   a  function  of   two  variables  f (x, y), for x  and  y 
ranging between  0 to 2 (scale: 1  unit  = 5  cm;   spacing between  contour levels: 0.2).

a)  Use  the  contour  plot  to  determine  whether  fx  and  fy  are  >  0,   =  0,   or  <  0  at   the 
point (1, 1.5).  Same question at the point (1.2, 0.6)? 
b)  The  function  plotted  on  the  ﬁgure  is  f (x, y) =  x3  − xy2  − 4x2  + 3x +  x2 y .  Calculate 
the actual  values of the partial  derivatives at (1, 1.5)   and (1.2, 0.6). 
c)  Use  the  applet  on  the  course  web  page  (http://math.mit.edu/18.02/applets/) 
to  plot  the  graph  of  f  corresponding  to   this  contour  plot.   Read  brieﬂy  the  directions  on 
the  web  page,  and  familiarize  yourself   with  the  controls.   In  the  “Level  curves”  view,  see 
how  the  slider  in  the  lower-left  corner  moves  the  highlighted  contour  line  on  both  plots, 
and  experiment  with  it  in  order  to  perfect  your  understanding  of   the  contour  plot.   In  the 
“Partial  derivatives”  view, see how clicking on a point in the small  contour plot displays the 
x- and  y -slices of  the graph through  that point.   Finally,  use the applet to check  the answers 
you found in (b). 
d)  Use  the  applet  to  ﬁnd  two  points  where  f x  =  f y  =  0,   and  give  their  approximate 
coordinates.  What happens  to the level  curves of   f  through  these  points?  For  each  of   the 
two points,  describe what happens when you move towards North, South, East, West: does 
the  value  of  f  go  up,  down,  or  does  it   stay  exactly   the  same?
