Due  Thursday  11/29/07,  12:45   pm. 

Part A

Work:  6A/ 1, 2, 3, 4;  6B/ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8. 

Vector  ﬁelds  in  3D;  surface  integrals  and  ﬂux. 

Lecture  31.  Fri  Nov.  16 
Read:  Notes  V10;  15.6.

Part B 

(26 points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions must be  written up   independently.  It is  illegal to  consult  materials from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

Write   the  names  of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and 
the  resources  you  used. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday  11/15,  2  points) 

Notes  6B/7. 

Problem  2.  (Friday  11/16,  8  points:  1+2+3+2)


Consider   a  tetrahedron  with   vertices  at  P0  = (0, 0, 0),  P1  = (1, 0, 1),  P2  = (1, 0, −1),  and

P3  = (1, 1, 0). 

a)  Which  two  faces  are  exchanged   by  the   symmetry  z  → −z? 

b)  Find   normals   to  each  face  (use  the   easiest  ones,  not  unit  normals), pointing outwards. 
(You   can   avoid  one  calculation   using  symmetry.) 
c)  Calculate  the  ﬂux  of  F~ =  yˆı  through  each  face.  (Because   F~ is  symmetric   with  respect 
to  z  → −z ,  you  can   again   avoid  one  calculation  using  symmetry.) 
d) Verify  the  divergence  theorem  for  the   tetrahedron  and  the vector  ﬁeld  F~ by computing  
each  side  of  the  formula.  

Problem  3.  (Friday  11/16,  5  points:  2+1+2) 
a)  Let  f (x, y , z ) = 1/ρ  = (x2  + y2  + z 2 )−1/2 .  Calculate   F~ =  ∇f ,  and  describe  geometri­
cally  the  vector  ﬁeld   F~ . 
b)  Evaluate  the  ﬂux  of  F~ over  the   sphere  of  radius  a  centered  at  the   origin. 
c)  Show  that  div  F~ =  0.  Does  the   answer  obtained  in  (b)  contradict  the   divergence 
theorem?  Explain.

Problem 4.  (Tuesday 11/20,  6  points:   1+2+2+1) 
The  Laplacian  of  a  function  f  is  the  quantity  ∇2 f  =  fxx  +  fyy  +  fzz ;  a  function  f  is 
harmonic  if  it  satisﬁes  the  Laplace  equation  ∇2 f  = 0.

c) Use the  result  of (b) to  show that, if   a function  f  is  harmonic  everywhere  in  D,  and 
f  is  zero at  every point of  the boundary  S , then  f  is  zero  everywhere  in  D.  (ﬁrst   show  that 
∇f  = 0).

d)  Deduce  that  if  two  functions  f  and  g  are  harmonic  everywhere  in  D,  and  f  =  g  on 
the boundary   S , then  f  =  g  everywhere in  D. 

Problem 5.  (Tuesday 11/27,  5  points:   2+1+2)  
a)  Compute  (in  terms  of  the  constants  a, b)  the  work  done  by  the  vector  ﬁeld  F~ = 
(a sin z  +  bxy2 )ˆı  + 2x2 y ˆ  + (x  cos  z  − z 2 ) kˆ along   the  portion  of   helix  x  =  cos  t,  y  =  sin t, 
z  =  t  from (1, 0, 0)  to (1, 0, 2π). 
b)  Compute  curl  F~ .  For  which  value(s)   of   a  and  b  is  the  vector  ﬁeld  F~ conservative? 
c) Let  a  and  b  be  the  values  you  found  above.  Find  a  potential   function  for  F~ using  
a systematic method, and verify the answer you found in part (a)  using the fundamental  
theorem  of  calculus.
