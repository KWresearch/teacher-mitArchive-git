18.02  Problem  Set  1 

Due 

Thursday 9/13/07, 12:45 pm.

18.02 Supplementary Notes and Problems. This is where to find the exercises labelled 1A, 1B,
etc.
Problem  Sets  have two parts, A and B.
Part  A  has  problems  from  the   text,  with  answers  to  many  in  the   back  of  the   text,  and 
problems  from  the  Notes  with   solutions  at  the   end  of  the   Notes.  Look  at  the   solutions  if 
you  get  stuck,  but  try  to  do  as  much  as  possible  without  them.  Hand  in  the   underlined 
problems  only;  the  others  are  for  more   practice.  Part  A  will  be  graded  quickly,  checking 
that  the  problems  are  there  and   the  solutions  not  merely  copied. 
Part  B  consists  of  unsolved  problems,  is  worth  more   points,  and  will  be  graded  more 
carefully.  Many  of  these  problems  are  longer multi-part   exercises  posed  here because  they 
do  not  ﬁt  conveniently  into  an  exam   or  short-answer  format. 
Advice:  Make  sure  that  you  understand  the   problems  by  comparing  your  answers 
against  the  solutions,  whether  before  (Part  A)  or  after  (Part  B)  the   assignment  is  due. 
Keep   up   with   the  work  in   small   installments  –  don’t  leave  it  all  for  a marathon  session 
on  Wednesday  night.  You  can’t  learn  well  under  time  pressure.  To  help  you   keep  up, 
each  problem  is  labelled  with   the  day  on   which you   will  have  the   needed  background  for  it. 
Homework  Rules:  Collaboration   on   problem   sets  is  encouraged,  but 
a)  Attempt  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  Read  each portion  of  the   problem  
before  asking  for  help.  If you  don’t  understand   what  is being   asked,  ask  for  help  interpreting 
the  problem  and  then   make  an  honest  attempt  to  solve  it. 
b)  Write  up  each  problem  independently.  On both Part A  and B  exercises you   are 
expected  to  write  the  answer  in   your  own  words. 
c)  Write  on  your  problem  set  whom  you  consulted  and  the  sources  you  used. 
If you   fail to do so, you may  be charged  with  plagiarism and sub ject to  serious penalties. 
d)  It  is  illegal  to  consult  materials  from  previous  semesters.

(27 points)  

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of   each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  
solutions  must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal   to   consult  materials  from   previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the  day  it   can  be  done.  
Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or  with  whom  you  collaborated  and 
the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no   consultation”.   This  includes  visits  outside 
recitation  to  your  recitation  instructor.  If  you  don’t  know  a  name,  you  must  nevertheless 
identify   the  person,  as  in,  “tutor  ”,   “the  student  next  to   me  in  recitation.” 
Optional:  note  which  of  these  people  or  resources,   if   any,  were  particularly  helpful  to   you.  

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  5  points:   2+1+1+1) 
The  eight  vertices  of  a  cube  centered  at (0, 0, 0)   of   side length 2  are  at (±1, ±1, ±1). 
a)  Find the four vertices of  the  cube, starting with (1, 1, 1),  that  form   a  regular  tetrahe­
dron.  Conﬁrm  your  answer  by  ﬁnding   the  length  of   an  edge  and  explaining   why  all  edges 
have  the  same  length. 

b)  A  methane  molecule  consists  of   a  hydrogen  atom   at   each  of   the  vertices  of   a  regular 
tetrahedron and a  carbon atom at the  center.   Find the  “bond angle”, i.e. the angle made by 
vectors from the  carbon atom to two hydrogen atoms (use a  calculator;   round your answer).  

c)  Use  dot  product  to  ﬁnd  the  angle  between  two  adjacent  edges  (sharing  a  common 
vertex)  of  the tetrahedron; and the angle between two opposite  edges.   Explain your answers 
using  symmetry. 

d) (Friday)  Find the  area  of  a face  of the tetrahedron. 

Problem  2.  (Thursday,  3  points:   1+1+1)  

Consider  a  triangle  in  the  plane  with  vertices  P1 ,  P2 ,  and  P3 . 

a) Let  v1 ,  v2  and  v3  be the vectors in the plane from the points P1 ,  P2  and  P3  respectively  
to a point  P . Express in terms of  the dot product and these three vectors the  condition that 
P  is  on  the  altitude  of  the  triangle  P1P2P3  from   the  vertex  P1 .  (By altitude  we  mean  the 
entire line through  a vertex perpendicular to the opposite side,   not just the segment from  
the  vertex  to  the  side.) 

b)  Assume  that  P 
is  at  the  intersection  of   the  altitudes  from   P1  and  P2 .  Show  that 
·
v1  v2  =  v1  v3  =  v2  v3 .
·
· 
c) Under  the  assumptions in (b),  show  that  P  is  also  on  the  altitude  from   P3 . (Hence 
all  three  altitudes  meet  in  one  point,   called  the  orthocenter.) 

Problem  3.  (Friday, 3 points) 

Four vectors are  erected perpendicularly  to the four faces of   a general  tetrahedron.  Each 
vector is pointing outwards and has length equal   to the area of   the face.   Show that the sum 
of  these  four   vectors  is  0. 
let  A,  B  and  C  be  vectors  representing  the  three  edges  starting  from   a  ﬁxed 
Hint: 
vertex.  Express  each  of  the  four   vectors  in  terms  of   A,  B  and  C ,  and  show  that  their  sum 
is the  zero vector;  do  not introduce a  coordinate system.  

Problem  4.  (Tuesday,  9  points:   1+2+2+2+2)  

Orthogonal  matrices  are  matrices  A  that  satisfy  the  identity  A AT  =  I  (I  is the identity 
matrix).  An  equivalent  deﬁnition  of   the  orthogonal  matrix  property  is  that  AT  A  =  I 

2 

because  the  left  and  right  inverses  of   a  square  matrix  are  the  same  (see  1G-9b).  The 
equation  AAT  =  I  says  that  the  rows  of   A  are  perpendicular  to   each  other  and  of   unit  
length,  whereas  the  equation  AT A  =  I  says  that  the  columns  of   A  are  perpendicular  to  
each  other  and  of  unit  length.  The  geometric  signiﬁcance  of   orthogonal  matrices  is  that 
multiplication  by  an  orthogonal  matrix  preserves  lengths  of   vectors  and  the  absolute  values 
of  angles  between  them: 

  (Av, Aw)| =  |6
  (v, w) .|
|Av| =  |v| and  |6
There  are  two  types  of  orthogonal  matrices,  rotations  and  reﬂections.  

a)  In  2-dimensional  space,  rotations  are  given  by 
(cid:19) 
(cid:18) 
cos  θ  − sin θ 
sin θ 
cos  θ 
Find  u =  Aθˆı  and  v =  Aθˆ ,  and  draw  a  picture  of   u  and  v  for  θ  =  π/4. 

Aθ  =	

b)  Use  the  addition  formulas  for  sine  and  cosine  to   deduce  that  Aθ1 Aθ2  =  Aθ1 +θ2 .  Say 
in  words  what  this  matrix  formula  means  about   rotations. 
c) Calculate  A−
1 ,  and  use  this  to   verify   that  AθAθ
T  =  I  (in  other  words,   rotations  are 
θ 
1  =  A−θ ,  and  give  a  geometric  reason  why  this 
orthogonal  matrices).  Also  verify  that  A−
θ 
property  holds. 
d)  Find  the  four  orthogonal  2  × 2  matrices  with  ﬁrst  entry  a11  =  −1/√2.   Hint:   try 
diﬀerent  signs.  (See  1F-9  and  1F-10). 
e) Next to  each  of the matrices  in your list in part (d), draw what the matrix does to  
the  letter  F  in  the  plane.  Explain  how  the  sign  of   the  determinant  of   the  matrix  is  related 
to  the  appearance  of  the  transformed  F. 

Problem  5.  (Tuesday,  7  points:   1+2+2+2) 

Cookies, doughnuts, and  croissants  contain  essentially   the same ingredients (ﬂour, sugar, 
egg,  butter)  but  in  diﬀerent  proportions.   For  example,   it   takes  22   grams  of   ﬂour  to  make  a 
cookie, versus 40 g  for a doughnut and 50 g for a  croissant.   The  compositions of  the various 
pastries  can  be  encoded  in  a  4  × 3  matrix,  
 

50  
22  
3   
  18  


5  



where  the  entries  in  the  i-th  row  represent  the  amounts  of   ingredient  i  (i  = 1  for  ﬂour,   2  for 
sugar,  3  for  egg,  4  for  butter)  required  to   make  the  various  types  of   pastries.

a)  Consider  an  assortment  of  x1  cookies,  x2  doughnuts  and  x3  croissants,   and  form   the 
column  vector 

 
x1 
X  =    x2    . 
x3 
What  do  the  entries  of  the  vector  M X  correspond to? 
b)  Each  of  the  four  ingredients  has  a  speciﬁc  nutritional  value:  for  example,   100  grams 
of  ﬂour  contain  10  g  of  protein,  76  g  of   carbohydrates,  and  1  g  of   fat.  Proceeding  similarly 
for  all  four  ingredients,  we  can  build  a  3  × 4  matrix,  
 


0.13  
0.10

0.76

0.01  
N  =   
0.10   0.82

where the  entries in the  i-th  column  represent  the  proportions  of   protein,   carbohydrates  and 
fat in ingredient  i. 

Give  a  matrix  formula  for  the  total  nutritional  value  of   the  assortment  of   pastries  con­
sidered in (a).  (Keep your answer in symbolic form, do  not   evaluate numerically.)  

c)  Give  a  matrix  formula  expressing  the  numbers  xi  of   pastries  of   each  type  which  will  
add  up  to  y1  g  of  protein,  y2  g  of  carbohydrates,  and  y3  g  of   fat.  Express  your  answer  in 
the form  X  =  AY ,  and  give  both  a  formula   for  A  and numerical   values  for its  entries (use 
either   a  calculator  or  Matlab;  short  directions  for  Matlab  can  be  found  on  the  course  web 
in the Assignments section.

d)  The  recommended  daily  amounts  of   protein,   carbohydrates  and  fat  for  a  2000   calorie 
diet  are  50,  300,  and  65  grams  respectively.  If  you  wanted  to   follow  those  guidelines  while 
eating  only  cookies,  doughnuts,  and  croissants,   how  many  pastries  of   each  type  should  you 
eat  daily?   What  is  wrong  with  your  answer?  Explain.
