Part  B 

(16 points)  

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of   each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  
solutions  must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal   to   consult  materials  from   previous 
semesters.  With  each  problem  is  the  day  it   can  be  done.  
Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or  with  whom  you  collaborated  and 
the  resources  you  used.  

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  4  points:   2+2) 
a) Show that, if  a simple  closed (positively   oriented)   curve  C  is  the  boundary  of   a  region 
R, then Area(R) =  �C  x dy =  �C  −y dx. 
b)  Use  this  result  to  calculate  the  area   of   the  region  between  the  x-axis  and  one  arch  of  
the  cycloid  with  parametric  equations  x =  a(t − sin t), y  =  a(1 − cos  t).   (Hint:   the  second 
line  integral  leads  to  easier  calculations).  

Problem  2.  (Thursday,  6  points:   4+2)

a) For what  simple closed (positively   oriented)   curve  C  in the plane  does the line integral 

�
− y) dx + (3x + 2y 2 x +  ey ) dy  have  the  largest  positive  value?  (use  Green’s 
(x 2 y +  y 3 
C 
theorem). 

b)  Determine  what  this  value  is. 

Problem  3.  (Friday,  6  points:  2+2+2)  
a)  Let  C  be  the  unit  circle,  oriented  counterclockwise,  and  consider  the  vector  ﬁeld 
F~ =  xy ˆı + y2 ˆ . Which portions of  C  contribute positively   to the  ﬂux of   F~ ?  Which portions 
contribute  negatively? 
b) Find the  ﬂux of  F~ through  C  by direct  calculation (evaluating a line integral).   Explain 
your  answer  using (a). 
c)  Find  the  ﬂux  of  F~ through  C  using Green’s theorem.
