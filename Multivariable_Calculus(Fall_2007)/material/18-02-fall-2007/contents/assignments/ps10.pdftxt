18.02  Problem  Set  10 

Due  Thursday  11/15/07,  12:45   pm. 

Part  A 

(10 points) 

Hand  in   the  underlined   problems  only;  the   others  are  for  more  practice. 
Exam  3  covering  lectures  18–26. 

Lecture  27.  Thu  Nov.  8 

Lecture  28. Fri Nov. 9 
Triple integrals in  rectangular  and  cylindrical  coordinates. 
Read:  12.8  to  p.   841;  Notes  I.3;  14.6  (esp.  Examples  1,  2,  3);  14.7   pp.  988–989. 
Work:  12.8/ 5, 23;  14.6/ 41;  14.7/ 9, 19; 5A/ 1, 2abcd, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

Spherical  coordinates.  Gravitational  attraction. 
Lecture  29.  Tue  Nov.  13 
Read:  Notes  I.4,  CV.4,  G;  14.7  pp.  990–992. 
Work:  12.8/ 9, 11, 15, 27, 55;  5B/ 1abc, 2, 3,  4abc;  5C/ 2, 3, 4. 

Part  B 

(16 points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions must be  written up   independently.  It is  illegal to  consult  materials from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Write  the  names  of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and 
the  resources  you  used. 

Problem  1.  (immediately, 4 points)

Find   the  ﬂux  of  the  vector  ﬁeld  F  = 
ˆ  outwards  through  any  circle   centered  at

(1, 0)  of  radius  a  �
1.  Consider   the  cases  a > 1  and 
a < 1  separately.  Explain your  answers 
= 
with  diagrams. 

Optional:   use the applet  on the  course  web page to get a better  understanding of what 
happens  when   a  changes  from  a  value  lower  than  1  to  a  value  greater  than  1. 

Problem  2.  (Friday, 4 points) 
Do  14.6/39.  (Suggestion:  use  the   order  dx dy dz .  The   numerical  answer  is  in  the   back 
of   the  text.  Feel  free  to  check  your  work  using  it.) 

Problem  3.  (Tuesday, 4 points)

The  average  value  of  f (x, y , z ) over  a  region  D  in  space   is

� � �
D 
Set  up  the  integral  both  in   cylindrical  and  spherical  coordinates  for  the   average   distance  
from  a  point  in   the  solid   sphere  of  radius  a  to  a  point  on   the   surface,  and  evaluate   both 
integrals.   Put  the  point  on  the  surface  at  the   origin   and  make  it  the   South  Pole  of  the  
sphere.  

f (x, y , z ) dV ,  V (D) =  volume   of  D
