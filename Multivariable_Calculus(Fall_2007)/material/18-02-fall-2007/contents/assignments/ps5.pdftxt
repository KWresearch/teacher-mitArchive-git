Due  Thursday  10/11/07,  12:45   pm . 

Part  A 

(8 points) 

Hand  in   the  underlined   problems  only;  the   others  are  for  more  practice. 

Lecture  13.  Thu  Oct.   4 
Read:  13.8. 
Work:  2D/ 1abe,  2b,  3ac, 8, 9;  2E/ 7. 

Gradient,  directional  derivative,  tangent  plane. 

Lecture  14.  Fri  Oct.  5 
Lagrange   multipliers. 
Read:  13.9  through   the  top  of  p.  922  –  one  constraint  only. 
Work:  2I/ 1, 3. 

Part  B 

(19 points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions must be  written up   independently.  It is  illegal to  consult  materials from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Write  the  names  of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and 
the  resources  you  used. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  8  points:  2+1+1+4)


As  in   PS3,  Problem  3,  consider  the   function


f (x, y) =  x 3  − xy 2  − 4x 2  + 3x  +  x 2 y . 

a)  Find   the  maximum  and   minimum   values  of  the   directional  derivative 

as  ˆ varies.

the   maximum   and  minimum   occur.

d)  Go  to  the  applet  (http://math.mit.edu/18.02/applets/)  and  select  “directional 
derivatives”  from  the  Show  menu.  Click  to  move  the   point  in  the   contour  plot  as  close  as 
you  can   to  (1/2, 1).   ((0.51, 1.01)  is  ok,  but  record  the   actual  values  of  x  and  y  that you   use.)

line,   and   the  purple  gradient  vector  on

Problem  2.  (Thursday,  5  points:  2+3) 
a)  Find   the  direction  from  (2, −1, 1)  in  which  g(x, y , z ) =  x2  +  yz  decreases  fastest. 

b)  Follow  the  line  in   the  direction  you   found  in  part  (a)  to  estimate,  using  linear  ap­
proximation,  the  location  of  the point  closest  to (2, −1, 1)  at  which  g  =  2.  Do  not  use  a 
calculator.   Express your  answer  using  fractions.  Next,  use a  calculator  to  evaluate  g  at your 
point.  (The  value  should  be  reasonably  close  to  2.)

Problem  3.  (Friday,  6  points:  2+4) 

a) Now  we  seek   an  exact  answer  to   Problem  2b.   Use  the  method  of   Lagrange  multipliers 
to write  down the system of equations satisﬁed by  the point  closest to (2, −1, 1)   at   which 
x2  +  yz  = 2.  (Hint:  it  is  easier   to  minimize  the  square  of the  distance).  

b)  Solve  the  equations  to  get  a  numerical   approximation  to   four  decimal   places  for  the 
location  of  the  point.  Compare  your  answers  with  the  approximation  in  2(b).  Was  each 
coordinate  of  the  approximate  answer  in  2(b)  within  1/100  of   the  exact   answer? 

Suggestion:  by  considering  the  sum  of   the  second  and  third  equations,  show  that  either 
z  =  −y  or  λ  =  2.  Assuming  z  =  −y ,  use  the  multiplier  equations  to   express  x, y , z  in 
terms  of  λ,  then  substitute  these  formulas  into   the  constraint  equation.  After  clearing   the 
denominator,  you  should  obtain  a  degree  4  equation  for  λ.  Use  a  calculator  to   solve  it. 
Alternatively,  in  Matlab,  roots([a4 , a3 , a2 , a1 , a0 ])   ﬁnds  the  roots  of   the  polynomial  a4λ4  + 
a3λ3 + a2λ2 + a1λ + a0  = 0.  (There  should  be  two  real roots).   Finally,  check  that  the  other 
case  λ  = 2 yields  solutions (x, y , z ) that  are further  away  from (2, −1, 1).
