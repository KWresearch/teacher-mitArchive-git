18.02  Problem  Set  7 

Due  Thursday  10/25/07,  12:45   pm. 

Part  A 

(15 points) 

Hand  in   the  underlined   problems  only;  the   others  are  for  more  practice. 

Lecture  18.  Thu  Oct.   18 
Double  integrals. 
Read:  14.1–14.3;  Notes  I.1.  Skip  the   theory.  Concentrate  on:

Iterated  integrals,  pp.  942–944,  Examples  2–4;

Evaluation  of  double   integrals,  pp.  950–952  and  Notes  I.1;

Calculation  of  area   and  volume   14.3.

Work:  3A/ 1,  2abc,  3ab,  4bc,  5abc,  6. 

Lecture  19. Fri  Oct. 19 
Double integrals in polar  coordinates. 
Read:  14.4  (concentrating  on  the   examples),  Notes  I.2; 
14.5  centroid,  pp.  968–970;  moment  of  inertia   pp.  973–975.

Work:  3B/ 1acd, 2bd, 3ac; 3C/ 1, 2a, 4;  14.4/ 4, 17, 25;  14.5/ 11.


Lecture  20.  Tue  Oct.  23 
Change  of  variables. 
Read:  Notes  CV;  14.9  Examples  1–4. 
Work:  3D/ 1, 2, 3, 4  (integrate in  the   order  du dv). 

Part  B 

(23 points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions must be  written up   independently.  It is  illegal to  consult  materials from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Write  the  names  of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and 
the  resources  you  used.

b) Use part (a) to  rewrite the integral you   wish to evaluate as a  double integral. Evaluate  
the  double  integral  by  exchanging  the   order  of  integration. 

Problem  2.  (Friday, 2 points) 

Show  that  the  average  distance   of  the   points  of  a  disk  of  radius  a  to  its  center  is  2a/3. 

Problem  3.  (Friday, 4 points) 

In  general,   the  moment  of  inertia  around  an   axis  (a  line)  L  is 
� �
dist( , L)2  δ dA. 
·
R 
The  collection   of  lines  parallel  to  the   y -axis  have  the   form  x  =  a.  Let  I  =  Iy  be  the   usual 
moment  of  inertia  around   the  y -axis 

IL  = 

I  = 

� �

R 

x 2 δ dA.

Let  I¯ be  the  moment  of  inertia  around  the  axis  x  =  x¯,  where ( ¯x,  y¯)  is  the  center  of   mass. 
Show that 

I  =  I¯ +  M x¯2 . 

This  is  known  as  the  parallel  axis  theorem. 

Problem  4.  (Friday, 5 points) 

Find the average area of  an inscribed triangle in the  unit circle.  Assume that  each  vertex 
of  the  triangle  is  equally  likely  to  be  at   any  point  of   the  unit   circle  and  that  the  location  of  
one  vertex  does  not  aﬀect  the  likelihood  the  location  of   another  in  any  way.  (Note  that,   as 
seen  in  Problem  set  4,  the  maximum   area  is  achieved  by  the  equilateral   triangle,   which  has 
√
√
side  length 
3  and  area  3 3/4.  How  does  the  maximum  compare  to   the  average?) 

Hint:  in  order  to  reduce  the  problem   to   the  calculation  of   a  double  integral,  place  one  of   the 
vertices  of  the triangle  at (1, 0), and  use the polar angles  θ1  and  θ2  of   the  two  other  vertices 
as  variables.  What  is  the  region  of  integration? 

Problem  5.  (Tuesday,  5  points)   Notes  3D/7. 

Problem  6.  (Tuesday, 4 points) 

Find the area of  the  ellipse (2x  + 5y −  3)2  + (3x  −  7y + 8)2  <  1.
