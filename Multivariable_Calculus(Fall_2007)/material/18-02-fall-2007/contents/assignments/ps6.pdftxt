Part  B 

(8 points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions  must  be  written  up   independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult  materials  from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Write  the  names   of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and 
the  resources  you  used. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday, 4 points) 
Suppose  that  g(x, y) =  c  a  constant  and  w  =  f (x, y , z ).  Which  of  the   following  makes 
sense  as  the  derivative  ∂w/∂x?  (If  so,  compute   it  in  terms  of  the   formal  derivatives  f x ,  f y , 
f ,  g ,  and   g .  If  not,  explain  why  not.)

Problem  2.  (Thursday,  4  points:  2+2)

a)   Suppose  that  t =  sin(x +  y) and  w =  x3 yt.  Find (∂w/∂ t)x .

b)  Consider   the  curve  of points (x, y , z ) satisfying x5 + yz = 3  and  xy2 + yz 2 + zx2  =  7.

Use  the  method  of  total  diﬀerentials  to  ﬁnd   dx/dy  at (x, y , z ) = (1, 1, 2).
