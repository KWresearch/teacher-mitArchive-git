18.02  Problem  Set  4 

Due  Thursday  10/4/07,  12:45   pm. 

Part A 

(15 points) 

Hand  in   the  underlined   problems  only;  the   others  are  for  more  practice. 

Lecture  10.  Thu  Sept.  27 
Maxima  and  minima.  Least  squares. 
Read:  13.5  pp.  878–881,   884–885;  Notes  LS 
Work:  2F/  1ab,   2;  2G/  1ab,   4. 

Lecture  11.  Fri  Sept.  28 
Second   derivative  test.  Boundaries  and  inﬁnity. 
Read:  13.10  through   the  top  of  p.  930;  Notes  SD. 
Work:  2H/  1ac,  3,  4,  6;  13.10/  32. 

Lecture  12.  Tue  Oct.   2 
Diﬀerentials.  Chain  rule. 
Read:  13.6  pp.  889–892† ;  13.7. 
Work  *:  2C/  1abcd,  2,  3,  5ab;  2E/  1abc,  2bc,  5,  8ab. 
†  Warning:  Don’t  mix   diﬀerentials  like  df  with  diﬀerences  like  Δx   and  Δy .  For  instance, 
equations  (5),  (7),  (9)  do  not  make  sense.  Instead,  use  (6), (8),  (10). 

*  Some   of  the  problems  are  written  so  as  to  depend  on  the  notation  for  gradient.  Look  ahead 
at  the  deﬁnition  of  gradient  in  13.8  (top  of  p.  910)  to  know  what  it  is  before  you  do  them. 

Part B 

(25 points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions must be  written up   independently.  It is  illegal to  consult  materials from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

Write  the  names  of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and  the  
resources   you  used. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday,  11 points:  2+0+3+2+3+1)   –  Least  squares  and  data   analysis. 

Parts  (b)-(f )  of  this  problem  involve  the   use  of  Matlab.  You   may  optionally  use  any 
other  software  with   similar  features,  or  even   a  calculator.  In   that  case,  indicate  what  you  
used,  and  describe  how you  proceeded.  You must  carry  out  the   actual  calculations  rather 
than  rely  on  the  statistical  functions  that  may  be  built  into  the   software  you   are  using. 

a)   Before  going  to  the  terminal,  read  Notes  LS  and  do   the   following.  Consider  the   row 
vectors  x  = [x1  x2  . . .  xn ],  y  = [y1  y2  . . .  yn ] and  u  = [1 1  . . .  1] (n  ones).  Let  y  =  ax  + b 
be  the best-ﬁtting  line  for  the  n  points (xi , yi ).  Translate  the   formula  (4)  in  LS  into  a  single  
2 ×  2  matrix  equation  

z  = 

a 
b 

Az  =  r, 

� 
� 
Write  the  entries  of  A  and  r  in   Matlab-ready  form.  Don’t  use  summations,  instead  use,  for 
′  � 
example,  x  ∗  u 
for 
xi .  You  will  be  able  to  conﬁrm  that  your  formulas  are  correct  by 
testing  them  on  a  concrete  example  using  Matlab  in  part  (c). 
b)  The  worldwide  sales  of  iPods  (in  million  units)  for  each  year  from  2001  to  2005  are 
given below  (sources:  Wikipedia,  Apple  quarterly  reports): 

1 

Years  (xi ) 
Sales  (yi ) 

’01 
0.125 

’02 
0.470 

’03 
1.451 

’04 
8.263 

’05 
31.960  

(To  make  the  numerical  answers  easier  to   read,   we  take  the  variable  x  to   be  the  year 
minus  2000,  so  xi  ranges  from  1  to  5  for  the  given  data  points). 

Look  at  the  Matlab  directions  for  plotting   at   the  end  of   this  problem  set  and  make  a 
scatter plot of  these  data points marked with  ∗’s.  (Nothing to   hand in; you will   do this over 
again  with  part (d).) 

c) Use Matlab, the data from (b) and the formulas you found in part (a)  to   ﬁnd the best 
line  y  =  ax  + b  ﬁtted  to  the  points.   Compute  the  diﬀerence  between  the  actual   value  of   the 
data  y  and  the  predicted  value  y  =  ax  +  b.   Report   a,  b, and the worst   case (largest  error). 

(Optional,  but recommended:  check  that your answer for  a  and  b  agrees with  the Matlab 
operation  polyﬁt(x,y,1),  which  computes  the  coeﬃcients  of   the  best  polynomial   of   degree  1 
ﬁtting  the  data  x  and  y.  If   c  = polyﬁt(x, y, 1)   then  c  = [a, b] is  the  transpose  of the  column 
vector  z  in part (a).  In this way you  can  conﬁrm that you did part (a)  correctly.) 

d)  When  a  new  product  is  launched,  in  the  initial   period  the  sales  tend  to   grow  expo­
nentially  rather  than  linearly.  Use  Matlab  to   ﬁnd  the  best  ﬁt  of   the  form   ln(y) =  a1x  +  b1 . 
(Note:  Matlab  uses  the  notation  log  for  natural   log,   and  log10  for  log  in  base  10.  So,   in 
Matlab  notation,  you  will  be  using  log(y).)  Report   your  values  of   a1 ,  b1 . 

If  you  exponentiate  this  equation,  you  get  

b1  a1 x 
y  =  e e 

Compute  the  diﬀerence  between  y  and  the  predicted  value  according   to   this  formula   and 
report the worst  case (largest  error). 

e) Hand in a  printout that  shows on the same plot:   the scatter plot  of (x, y) labelled with 
∗’s, the straight line  ﬁt, (x, ax  +  b) as a  dashed line, and the  curve (x, eb1 ea1 x ),   connected 
by  an  ordinary   line. 

f )  According  to  the  exponential  best  ﬁt,   how  many  iPods  were  sold  in  2006?  how  many 
will  be  sold  in  2015?  (for  comparison,   the  total  world  population  is  about   6.6  billions).  In 
fact,  the  growth  is  no  longer  exponential:  “only”  46.4   million  iPods  were  sold  in  2006. 

Problem 2.  (Friday,  8  points:  2+2+2+2) 

Consider a triangle inscribed in the  unit circle in the plane, with  one vertex at (1, 0)   and 
the  two  other  vertices  given  by  polar  angles  θ1  and  θ2 ,  in  that  order  counterclockwise. 

a)  Express  the  area  A  of  the  triangle  in  terms  of   θ1  and  θ2 .  What  is  the  set  of   possible 
values  for  θ1  and  θ2 ? 

b)  Find  the  critical  points  of  the  function  A  in  this  region.  

c)  By  computing  the  values  of  A  at the  critical points and its behavior on the boundary 
of  the  region  where  it  is  deﬁned,  ﬁnd  the  maximum  and  the  minimum  of   A  (justify your 
answer).  Describe  the  shapes  of  the  triangles  corresponding  to   these  two  situations.  

d)  Use  the  second  derivative  test   to   conﬁrm  the  nature  of   the  critical  points  you  found 
in (b).

Problem 3.  (Tuesday, 6 points:   1+2+2+1) (see  also 2E/5)  

a)  Let  w  =  f (x, y),  and  suppose  we  change  from   rectangular  to   polar  coordinates: 
x  =  r  cos  θ ,  y  =  r  sin θ .  Using  the  chain  rule,   derive  the  change  of   variables  formula   in 
matrix form: 
�

writing  the  entries  of  the  2  ×  2  matrix  A  as  functions  of   r  and  θ . 
x2  +  y2 ,  θ  =  tan−1 y/x  to   similarly  derive  the  converse

writing  the  entries  of  the  2  ×  2  matrix  B  as  functions  of   x  and  y . 
c) Check  that  B  =  A−1  by  computing the  product  A B  and  changing   variables. 

b)  Use  the  formulas  r  = 
formula: 

wx

=  B

d) If   wr  = 2  and  wθ  =  10  at  the  point  of   polar  coordinates  r  = 5,   θ  =  π/2,  compute  wx 
and  wy  at  the  same  point.

Matlab   Directions 

You  can   reach  Matlab  in   MIT Server by  clicking  on   the   main  menu  (lower  left  icon   with 
the  footprint),  then   Math/Plotting,  then  Matlab. 

Be  patient  –  it  takes  Matlab  several  seconds  to  load.  Wait  for  the   prompt  symbol:  >>. 
You  can   leave  Matlab  by  typing  exit  [return],  or  by  closing  the   window.  Matlab  calculates 
with  matrices  and   vectors  and   draws  graphs  in  2D  and  3D.  Skip  the   Introduction  and  Help  
documents;  as  preliminary  practice,  just  read  and  carry  out  the   following. 

Entering  matrices  and  vectors.  In   Matlab  the   variables  represent  matrices  and  vectors. 
The  symbol  =  assigns  the  value  on  the   right  side   of  the   equation  to  the   symbol  on   the   left. 
Type  each  of  these  lines  in   order,  and  see  what  you   get.  (Always  hit  [return]  to  end  a  line  
or  command.) 
A  =  [1  2  3;  4  5  6;  7  8  9] 
b  =  [5  2  1] 

b’ 
(transpose:  gives  the  column   vector  which  Matlab  cal ls   [5;2;1]) 
Try  making  a  mistake:  C  =  [1,2,3;  4,5].  To  edit  the   mistake,  press  any  of  the   four  arrow 
keys  to  get  the  line  back.  (You  can  also   prepare  your  commands  in  a  text  editor  and  copy 
them  with   the  mouse  onto  the  Matlab  command  line.) 

(you   can  use  commas  instead  of  spaces:  1,2,3;) 

Operations  with  matrices  and  vectors 

A+B,  A-B 
(matrices  must  be  same   size) 
(matrices  must  be  compatibly  sized) 
(A  times   itself  n  times;  A  must  be  square) 

Sum,  diﬀerence 
A*B 
Product 
A^n 
Powers 
A’ 
Transpose 
inv(A)  (or  A^-1) 
Inverse  
Try  typing  (use  the  values  of  A  and  b  above):  A*b 
A*b’ 
b*A 
Array  operations.  Recall  that  *  and  ^  are  product  and power  operations  for  matri­
ces.  Adding  a  dot  before  *  or  ^  makes  these  operations  act  component-wise.  So,  if  x = 
[x1  x2 
. . .  xn],   then  
exp(x)  =  [exp(x1 ) 
. . .  exp(xn )]  (similarly  with  sin,  cos,  log,  etc.) 
x+y  =  [x1  +  y1 
. . .  xn  +  yn]  (similarly  with  -) 
x.*y  =  [x1 y1 
. . .  xn yn] 
. . .  xn  ] 
x.^m  =  [x1 
m
m
Colon   operator.  This  generates  a  vector  with  equally  spaced  entries;  for  example, 

(m  can  be  zero) 

[0 : 2  :  12]  =  [0 2 4 6 8  10  12];  

[2 :  −.1 : 1.6]  = [2.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6] 

Two-dimensional  plots  in  Matlab.  Given   x  = [x1  x2  . . .  xn ],  y  = [y1  . . .  yn ] , 

plot(x, y)  plots  the n  points (xi , yi ),  joined  by  solid  line   segments.

plot(x, y , ′  −− ′  ) 
plots  the  n  points,  joined  by  dashed  line   segments.

plot(x, y ,  ∗ ′  ) 
′ 
plots  the  n  points  as  individual  stars  (or  dots  or  circles,  etc). 
print  gives  a  print-out  of  the  current  screen  plot. 

Try  in  order  (press  [return]  after   each  command): 
x=[0:.1:2]

plot(x,sin(x))

plot(x,4*x.^3) 

(this  plots  y  = 4x3 ;  note   the   need  for  the   array  operator) 

You  can   also  combine  two  plot  commands:  for  example, 
plot(x,sin(x),’*’,x,cos(x),’--’)
