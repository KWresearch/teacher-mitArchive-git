Part  B 

(12 points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions must be  written up   independently.  It is  illegal to  consult  materials from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

Write  the  names   of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and  the  
resources   you  used. 

Problem  1.  (Friday,  6  points:  3+3) 
Consider   the  four  points  A  :  (2, 4, 0),  B  :  (3, 1, 1),  C  :  (1, 1, 3),  D  :  (0, 5, 1).  Find  the  
distance between  the  lines (AB ) and (CD),  i.e.  the   distance   between  the   closest  points  on  
these  two  lines,  by  using  two  diﬀerent  methods: 

a) Find a pair of planes which  are  parallel to both lines, with the ﬁrst plane containing the  
line (AB ) and   the  second  plane  containing  the   line (CD).  Then  ﬁnd   the   distance   between 
these  two  planes. 

b)  Find   parametric  equations   of  the   lines (AB ) and (CD),  and  ﬁnd   the   times  at  which 
the  line  segment  connecting  a  point  P1  on (AB ) to  a  point  P2  on (CD) is perpendicular  to 
both  lines.  The  length  of  this  segment  is  then  the   distance   between  the   lines. 
Important:  since  the positions  of  the points  P1  and  P2  can  be  chosen   independently  of 
each  other,  the  parameters  on  the  two  lines  should  be  allowed   to  vary  independently  of  each 
other  (call   them  t1  and  t2  for  example). 

Problem  2.  (Friday,  6  points:  4+2) 
A mechanical  device  consists of two  circular  gears,  one of  radius 2  centered at (0, −2)  and 
the  other of  radius 1  centered at (0, 1).  The   gear  of  radius 2  rotates  clockwise  at  unit  angular 
velocity  (1  radian  per  second),  while  the   gear  of  radius  1  rotates  counterclockwise  without 
slipping  at  the  contact  point.  The   two  gears  each  carry  a  small  peg   on   their  circumference, 
and  these  pegs  are  connected   together  by  an   elastic   band.  Initially,  both  pegs  are  at  the  
origin. 
a) Write  parametric  equations   for  the   motion  of  the   midpoint  P  of  the   elastic   band.  (Use 
vectors;  begin by  expressing  the position   vector  in  terms  of  simpler  vectors,  then  express 
each  of  them  in   terms  of  t). 
b) (Tuesday)  Express   the velocity of  the point  P  as  a  function  of  t.  Calculate   the   velocity 
and  the  acceleration  at  t =  0.
