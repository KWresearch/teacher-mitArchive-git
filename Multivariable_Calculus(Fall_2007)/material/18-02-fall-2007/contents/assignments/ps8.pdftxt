Part  B 

(15 points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem yourself.  If you   collaborate, 
solutions must be  written up   independently.  It is  illegal to  consult  materials from  previous 
semesters.  With   each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 
Write  the  names  of  all  the people you   consulted  or  with  whom you   collaborated   and 
the  resources  you  used. 

Problem  1.  (Thursday, 3 points) 
Consider   the  vector  ﬁeld   F~ = (x2 y  +  1
3 y3 ) ˆı ,  and  let  C  be  the portion  of  the   graph  
y  =  f (x) running  from (x1 , f (x1 ))  to (x2 , f (x2 ))  (assume  that  x1  < x2 ,  and  f  takes positive 
 
C  F~ ·  d~r  is  equal  to  the   polar  moment  of  inertia   of  the  
values).   Show  that  the  line  integral  �
region   R  lying below  C  and  above  the   x-axis  (with   density  δ  =  1). 

Consider   the  vector  ﬁeld   F~ (x, y) = 

Problem  2.  (Friday,  8  points:  1+2+2+1+2) 
−y ˆı +  x ˆ 
. 
x2  +  y2 
a)  Show  that  F~ is  the  gradient  of  the polar  angle   function  θ(x, y) =  tan−1 (y/x) deﬁned  
over  the  right  half-plane  x >  0.  (Note:  this  formula  for  θ  does  not  make  sense  for  x  =  0!) 

b)  Suppose  that  C  is  a  smooth  curve  in  the   right  half-plane  x >  0  joining  two  points 
 
C  F~ ·  d~r  in  terms  of  the polar  coordinates (r1 , θ1 ) and 
A  : (x1 , y1 ) and  B  : (x2 , y2 ).  Express  �
(r2 , θ2 ) of  A  and  B . 

 
 
F~ ·  d~r ,  where 
F~ ·  d~r  and  �
c)  Compute  directly  from  the  deﬁnition  the   line   integrals  �
C2 
C1 
C1  is  the  upper  half   of  the  unit  circle  running  from  (1, 0)  to (−1, 0),  and  C2  is  the   lower  half 
of   the  unit  circle,  also  going  from  (1, 0)  to (−1, 0). 
d)  (Tuesday)  Show  that  the  curl  of  F~ is  zero   at  any point  of  the   plane   where  F~ is  deﬁned  
(not  just  in   the  right  half-plane  x >  0). 
e)  (Tuesday)  Using  the  results   of  parts  (a)-(d),  is  F~ conservative  (path-independent) over 
its  entire  domain  of  deﬁnition?  Is  it  conservative  over  the   right  half-plane  x >  0?  Justify 
your  answers.

Note:  in  fact  it  is  true  that  F~ =  ∇θ   everywhere.  However,  the  polar  angle  θ  cannot be 
deﬁned as a single-valued diﬀerentiable function  everywhere (if you try, you will   ﬁnd that it  
is  only  well-deﬁned  up  to  adding  multiples  of   2π).   This is  why  in  parts (a)  and (b)   we  only 
consider  the  right  half-plane;  any  other  region  over  which  θ  can  be  deﬁned  unambiguously 
in  a  continuous  manner  would  be  equally   suitable. 

Problem  3.  (Tuesday,  4  points:   2+2) 
a) Calculate the  curl  of  F~ =  rn (x ˆı + y ˆ ) (where r  = 
for  rx  and  ry ). 
b)  Whenever  possible,  ﬁnd  a  potential   g  such that  F~ =  ∇g .  (Hint:   look   for  a  potential  
 
�
x2  +  y2 .  Watch  out   for  a  certain  negative  value  of   n  for 
of  the  form  g  =  g(r),  with r  = 
which  the  general  formula  doesn’t  work.)
