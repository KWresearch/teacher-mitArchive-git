Goal  of  multivariable  calculus:  tools  to  handle  problems  with  several  parameters  –  functions  of 
several  variables. 
Vectors.  A  vector  (notation:  A� )  has  a  direction,  and  a  length  (|A� |).  It  is  represented  by 
a  directed  line  segment.  In  a  coordinate  system  it’s  expressed  by  components:  in  space,  A� = 
�a1 , a2 , a3 � = a1ˆı + a2ˆj + a3kˆ .  (Recall  in  space  x-axis  points  to  the  lower-left,  y  to  the  right,  z  up). 
Scalar multiplication 
Formula  for  length?  Showed  picture  of  �3, 2, 1�  and  used  ﬂashcards  to  ask  for  its  length.  Most

students  got  the  right  answer  (
 why  |A� |  = 
2  by  reducing  to  the  Pythagorean  theorem  in  the

You can explain
A� and  its pro jection  to  the xy -plane,  then derived  |A� |
plane  (Draw a picture,  
showing
from length
 
 
of  pro jection  +  Pythagorean  theorem). 
Vector addition:  A� + B� by head-to-tail addition: 
 in a parallelogram (showed how 
 
 
Draw a picture
the  diagonals  are  A� + B� and  B� − A� ); 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addition works componentwise, and it is true that
  A� = 3ˆı + 2ˆj + kˆ on  the  displayed  example. 
Dot  product. 
·

Deﬁnition:  A� B� = a1 b1  + a2 b2  + a3 b3  (a  scalar,  not  a  vector).
Theorem:  geometrically,  A� · B� = |A� ||B� | cos θ .

Explained the theorem as  follows:  ﬁrst, A� A� =  A� 2 cos 0 =  |A� 2  is consistent with the deﬁnition.

Next,  consider  a  triangle  with  sides  A� ,  B� ,  C� =  A� − B� .  Then  the  law  of  cosines  gives  C� =

|A� |2  + |B� |2  − 2|A� ||B� | cos θ ,  while  we  get 
C = C C  = (A� − B� ) (A� − B� ) = |A� 2  + | � − 2A� B .

Hence  the  theorem  is  a  vector  formulation  of  the  law  of  cosines.

Note  the  sign  of  dot  product:  positive  if  angle  less  than  90◦ ,  negative  if  angle  more  than  90◦ , 
zero  if  perpendicular. 
2)  detecting  orthogonality. 
Example:  what  is  the set of points where x + 2y + 3z = 0?  (possible answers:  empty set, a point, 
a  line,  a  plane,  a  sphere,  none  of  the  above,  I  don’t  know). 
Answer:  plane;  can  see  “by  hand”,  but  more  geometrically  use  dot  product:  call  A� =  �1, 2, 3�,

P  = (x, y , z ),  then  A� · OP  = x + 2y + 3z = 0 ⇔ | � OP  | cos θ = 0 ⇔  θ = π/2 ⇔  � OP  .  So  we
A ⊥ 
get  the  plane  through  O  with  normal  vector  A� . 

Applications.  1)  computing  lengths  and  angles:  cos θ =

Geometrically:


We’ve  seen  two applications of dot product:  ﬁnding  lengths/angles,  and detecting orthogonality. 
A third one:  ﬁnding components of a vector.  If uˆ is a unit vector, A� · uˆ =  |A� | cos θ  is the component 
· 
of  A� along  the  direction  of  uˆ .  E.g.,  A� ˆı  =  component  of  A� along  x-axis.
Example:  pendulum  making  an  angle  with  vertical,  force  =  weight  of  pendulum  F� pointing 
downwards:  then  the  physically  important  quantities  are  the  components  of  F� along  tangential 
direction  (causes  pendulum’s  motion),  and  along  normal  direction  (causes  string  tension). 
Area.  E.g.  of  a  polygon  in  plane:  break  into  triangles.  Area  of  triangle  =  1  base × height  = 
2 
1 |A� ||B� | sin θ  (= 1/2 area of parallelogram).  Could get sin θ  using dot product to compute cos θ  and
2 
sin2 + cos2  = 1,  but  it  gives  an  ugly  formula.  Instead,  reduce  to  complementary  angle  θ �  = π/2 − θ 
by  considering  A� �  =  A� rotated  90◦  counterclockwise  (drew  a  picture).  Then  area  of  parallelogram 
=  |A� ||B� | sin θ =  |A� � ||B� | cos θ �  = A� �  · B� . 
Q:  if  A� =  �a1 , a2 �,  then  what  is  A� �?  (showed  picture,  used  ﬂashcards).  Answer:  A� �  =  �−a2 , a1 �.

Geometrically:  |A� × B� |  =  area  of  space  parallelogram  with  sides  A� ,  B� ;  direction  =  normal  to 
the  plane  containing  A� and  B� . 
How to decide between the two perpendicular directions = right-hand rule.  1) extend right hand 
in direction of A� ; 2) curl ﬁngers towards direction of B� ; 3) thumb points in same direction as A� × B� .
