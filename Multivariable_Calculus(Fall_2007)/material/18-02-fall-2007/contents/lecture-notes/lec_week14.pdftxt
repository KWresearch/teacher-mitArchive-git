Applications  of  div  and  curl  to  physics. 
· 
Recall:  curl  of  velocity  ﬁeld =  2 angular  velocity  vector  (of  the  rotation  component  of motion). 
E.g.,  for  uniform  rotation  about  z -axis,  v = ω(−yˆı + xˆj ),  and � × v = 2ωkˆ . 
Curl  singles  out  the  rotation  component  of  motion  (while  div  singles  out  the  stretching  compo­
nent). 
Interpretation  of  curl  for  force  ﬁelds. 
��� 
If  we  have  a  solid  in  a  force  ﬁeld  (or  rather  an  acceleration  ﬁeld!)  F  such  that  the  force  exerted 
on  Δm  at  (x, y , z )  is  F(x, y , z ) Δm:  recall  the  torque  of  the  force  about  the  origin  is  deﬁned  as 
τ  = �r × F  (for  the  entire  solid,  take 
. . .  δ dV ),  and measures  how  F  imparts  rotation motion.

Consequence:  if F derives from a potential, then �×F = �× (�f ) = 0, so F does not induce any 
rotation motion.  E.g., gravitational attraction by itself does not aﬀect Earth’s rotation.  (not strictly 
true:  actually  Earth  is  deformable;  similarly,  friction  and  tidal  eﬀects  due  to  Earth’s  gravitational 
attraction  explain  why  the Moon’s  rotation  and  revolution  around  Earth  are  synchronous). 
Div  and  curl  of  electrical  ﬁeld.  –  part  of Maxwell’s  equations  for  electromagnetic  ﬁelds.

This  formula  tells  how  charges  inﬂuence  the  electric  ﬁeld;  e.g.,  it  governs  the  relation  between 
voltage  between  the  two  plates  of  a  capacitor  and  its  electric  charge.

So  in  presence  of  a  varying  magnetic  ﬁeld,  E� is  no  longer  conservative:  if  we  have  a  closed  loop

This  principle  is  used  e.g.  in  transformers  in  power  adapters:  AC  runs  through  a  wire  looped 
around  a  cylinder,  which  creates  an  alternating  magnetic  ﬁeld;  the  ﬂux  of  this  magnetic  ﬁeld 
through  another  output  wire  loop  creates  an  output  voltage  between  its  ends. 
There  are  two  more  Maxwell  equations,  governing  div  and  curl  of  B� :  � · B� =  0,  and  � × B� = 
∂E�
(where  J� =  current  density).
