Clariﬁcation  from  end  of  last  lecture:  we  derived  the  diﬀusion  equation  from  2  inputs.  u  = 
concentration,  F  =  ﬂow,  satisfy: 
1)  from  physics:  F = −k�u, 
2)  from  divergence  theorem:  ∂u/∂ t = −div F. 
Combining,  we  get  the  diﬀusion  equation:  ∂u/∂ t = −div F = +kdiv (�u) = k�2u.

Gradient  ﬁelds. 
F = �P , Q, R� = �fx , fy , fz �  ? 
Then  fxy  = fyx ,  fxz  = fzx ,  fyz  = fzy ,  so  Py  = Qx ,  Pz  = Rx ,  Qz  = Ry . 
Theorem:  F  is  a  gradient  ﬁeld  if  and  only  if  these  equalities  hold  (assuming  deﬁned  in  whole 
space  or  simply  connected  region) 
Example:  for  which  a, b  is  axyˆı + (x2  + z 3 )ˆj + (byz 2  − 4z 3 )kˆ a  gradient  ﬁeld? 
Py  = ax = 2x = Qx  so  a = 2;  Pz  = 0 = 0 = Rx ;  Qz  = 3z 2  = bz 2  = Ry  so  b = 3. 
Systematic  method  to  ﬁnd  a  potential:  (carried  out  on  above  example) 
fx  = 2xy ,  fy  = x2  + z 3 ,  fz  = 3yz 2  − 4z 3 : 
⇒ 
f (x, y , z ) = x2y + g(y , z ).
fx  = 2xy 
⇒
⇒ 
fy  = x2  + gy  = x2  + z 3 
gy  = z 3 
g(y , z ) = yz 3  + h(z ),  and  f  = x2y + yz 3  + h(z ).
fz  = 3yz 2 + h� (z ) = 3yz 2 − 4z 3  ⇒  h� (z ) = �−
4z 3  ⇒  h(z ) = −z 4 + c,  and  f  = x2y + yz 3 − z 4 + c.

Interpretation  of  curl  for  velocity  ﬁelds:  curl measures  angular  velocity. 
Example:  rotation  around  z -axis  at  constant  angular velocity ω  (tra jectories  are  circles  centered 
on  z -axis):  v = �−ωy , ωx, 0�. 
Then  � × v  =  ... =  0ˆı  + 0ˆj + (ω + ω)kˆ = 2ωkˆ .  So  length  of  curl  =  twice  angular  velocity,  and 
direction  =  axis  of  rotation. 
A  general  motion  can  be  complicated,  but  decomposes  into  various  eﬀects. 
•  curl measures  the  rotation  component  of  a  complex motion.

Orientation:  compatibility  of  an  orientation  of  C  with  an  orientation  of  S  (changing  orientation 
changes  sign  on  both  sides  of  Stokes). 
Rule:  if  I  walk  along  C  in  positive  direction,  with  S  to  my  left,  then  nˆ is  pointing  up.  (Various 
examples  shown.) 
Another formulation (right-hand rule):  if thumb points along C  (1-D ob ject), index ﬁnger towards 
S  (2-D  ob ject),  then middle  ﬁnger  points  along  nˆ (3-D  ob ject).

Remark.  In  Stokes’  theorem  we  are  free  to  choose  any  surface  S  bounded  by  C !  (e.g.  if  C  = 
circle,  S  could  be  a  disk,  a  hemisphere,  a  cone,  ...) 
“Proof ”  of  Stokes. 
1)  if  C  and  S  are  in  the  xy -plane  then  the  statement  follows  from  Green. 
2) if C and S are in an arbitrary plane:  this also reduces to Green in the given plane.  Green/Stokes 
works  in  any plane because  of  geometric  invariance  of work,  curl  and ﬂux under  rotations  of  space. 
They  can  be  deﬁned  in  purely  geometric  terms  so  as  not  to  depend  on  the  coordinate  system 
(x, y , z );  equivalently,  we  can  choose  coordinates  (u, v , w)  adapted  to  the  given  plane,  and  work 

3 

with  those  coordinates,  the  expressions  of work,  curl,  ﬂux will  be  the  familiar  ones  replacing  x, y , z 
with  u, v , w. 
3)  in  general, we  can  decompose  S  into  small  pieces,  each  piece  is  nearly  ﬂat  (slanted  plane);  on 
each  piece  we  have  approximately  work  =  ﬂux  by  Green’s  theorem.  When  adding  pieces,  the  line 
integrals  over  the  inner  boundaries  cancel  each  other  and  we  get  the  line  integral  over  C ;  the  ﬂux 
integrals  add  up  to  ﬂux  through  S . 
Example:  verify  Stokes  for  F =  zˆı  + xˆj + ykˆ ,  C  =  unit  circle  in  xy -plane  (counterclockwise),

Stokes  and  path  independence. 
Deﬁnition:  a  region  is  simply  connected  if  every  closed  loop  C  inside  it  bounds  some  surface  S 
inside  it. 
Example:  the  complement  of  the  z -axis  is  not  simply  connected  (shown  by  considering  a  loop 
encircling  the  z -axis);  the  complement  of  the  origin  is  simply  connected. 
Topology:  uses these considerations to classify for example surfaces in space:  e.g., the mathemat­
ical  proof  that  a  sphere  and  a  torus  are  “diﬀerent”  surfaces  is  that  the  sphere  is  simply  connected, 
the  torus  isn’t  (in  fact  it  has  two  “independent”  loops  that  don’t  bound). 
� 
Recall:  if  F  is  a  gradient  ﬁeld  then  curl(F) = 0. 
Conversely, Theorem:  if � × F = 0 in a simply connected region then F is conservative (so  F d�r·
� 
� 
is  path-independent  and  we  can  ﬁnd  a  potential). 
Proof:  Assume  R  simply  connected,  � × F =  0,  and  consider  two  curves  C1  and  C2  with  same 
� 
�� 
·  r −  C2 
end  points.  Then  C  =  C1  − C2  is  a  closed  curve  so  bounds  some  S ;

Orientability.  We  can  apply  Stokes’  theorem  to  any  surface  S  bounded  by  C ...  provided  that 
it  has  a  well-deﬁned  normal  vector!  Counterexample  shown:  the  M¨obius  strip.  It’s  a  one-sided 
surface,  so  we  can’t  compute  ﬂux  through  it  (no  possible  consistent  choice  of  orientation  of  nˆ ). 
Instead,  if we want to apply Stokes to the boundary curve C , we must ﬁnd a two-sided surface with 
boundary  C .  (pictures  shown).

Review  for  Exam  4.

We’ve  seen  three  types  of  integrals,  with  diﬀerent  ways  of  evaluating: 
�� 
f dV  in rect., cyl., spherical coordinates (I re-explained the general setup and the formulas 
1) 
for  dV );  applications:  center  of mass, moment  of  inertia,  gravitational  attraction.

S F nˆ dS ,  by  knowing  formulas  for  nˆ dS .
2)  surface  integrals,  ﬂux.  Setting  up 
We  have  seen:  planes  parallel  to  coordinate  planes  (e.g.  yz -plane:  nˆ = ±ˆı ,  dS  = dy dz );  spheres 
and  cylinders  (nˆ =  straight  out/in  from  center  or  axis;  dS  =  a dz dθ  for  cylinders,  a2 sin φ dφdθ 
for  spheres);  if  we  can  express  z  =  f (x, y),  nˆ dS  =  ±�−fx , −fy , 1�dx dy  (recall  �. . . �  is  not  nˆ

While  these  various  types  of  integrals  are  completely  diﬀerent  in  terms  of  interpretation  and
