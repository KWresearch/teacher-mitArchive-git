Non-independent  variables. 
Often  we  have  to  deal  with  non-independent  variables,  e.g.  f (P , V , T )  where  P V  = nRT . 
Question:  if  g(x, y , z ) = c  then  can  think  of  z = z (x, y).  What  are  ∂ z/∂x,  ∂ z/∂ y? 
Example:
 x
2  + yz + z 3 =
 8  at  (2, 3, 1).  Take  diﬀerential:  2x dx + z dy + (y + 3z 
 2 ) dz  =
 0,  i.e.

−

dx −

So  ∂ z/∂x  =  −4/6 =  −2/3  and

4 dx + dy + 6 dz  =  0  (constraint  g  =  c),  or  dz

6 dy .

−1/6  (taking  the  coeﬃcients  of  dx  and  dy).  Or  equivalently:  if  y  is  held  constant  then 
6
∂ z/∂ y  =

we  substitute  dy = 0  to  get  dz = −4/6 dx,  so  ∂ z/∂x = −4/6 = −2/3. 
⇒
In  general:  g(x, y , z ) =  c
gx dx + gy  dy + gz  dz  = 0.  If  y  held  ﬁxed,  get  gx dx + gz  dz  = 0,  i.e. 
dz = −gx/gz  dx,  and  ∂ z/∂x = −gx/gz . 
Warning:  notation  can  be  dangerous!  For  example:

f (x, y) = x + y ,  ∂ f /∂x = 1.  Change  of  variables  x = u,  y = u + v  then  f  = 2u + v ,  ∂ f /∂u = 2.

x = u  but  ∂ f /∂x =� ∂ f /∂u  !!

�  � 
This  is  because  ∂ f /∂x  means  change  x  keeping  y  ﬁxed,  while  ∂ f /∂u  means  change  u  keeping  v

ﬁxed,  i.e.  change  x  keeping  y − x  ﬁxed. 
� � 
∂ f 
When  there’s  ambiguity,  we  must  precise  what  is  held  ﬁxed: 
∂x 
y

�  � 
�  � 
∂ f 
=  deriv.  /  u  with  v  held  ﬁxed. 
∂u  v 
∂ f 
∂ f 
∂ f 
We now have

In  above  example,  we  computed  (∂ z/∂x)y .  When  there  is  no  risk  of  confusion  we  keep  the  old 
notation,  by  default  ∂ /∂x means  we  keep  y  ﬁxed.

Example:  area  of  a  triangle  with  2  sides  a  and  b  making  an  angle  θ  is  A =
 1 
2 ab sin θ .  Suppose

it’s  a  right  triangle  with  b  the  hypothenuse,  then  constraint  a = b cos θ . 
3  ways  in  which  rate  of  change  of  A  w.r.t.  θ  makes  sense: 
∂A 
=  Aθ  (with  a  and  b  held  ﬁxed).  This 
1)  view  A  =  A(a, b, θ)  independent  variables,  usual 
∂ θ 
answers  the  question:  a  and  b  ﬁxed,  θ  changes,  triangle  stops  being  a  right  triangle,  what  happens 
2)  constraint �

The  two  systematic  methods  essentially  involve  calculating  the  same  quantities,  even  though 
things  are  written  diﬀerently.

Review  topics. 
–  Functions  of  several  variables,  contour  plots. 
–  Partial  derivatives,  gradient;  approximation  formulas,  tangent  planes,  directional  derivatives. 
Note:  partial  diﬀerential  equations  (=  equations  involving  partial  derivatives  of  an  unknown 
function)  are  very  important  in  physics.  E.g.,  heat  equation:  ∂ f /∂ t  =  k(∂ 2f /∂x2  + ∂ 2f /∂ y2  + 
∂ 2f /∂ z 2 )  describes  evolution  of  temperature  over  time. 
– Min/max  problems:  critical  points,  2nd  derivative  test,  checking  boundary. 
(least  squares  won’t  be  on  the  exam) 
–  Diﬀerentials,  chain  rule,  change  of  variables. 
–  Non-independent  variables:  Lagrange  multipliers,  and  constrained  partial  derivatives. 
Re-explanation  of  how  to  compute  constrained  partials:  say  f  =  f (x, y , z )  where  g(x, y , z ) =  c. 
To  ﬁnd  (∂ f /∂ z )y : 
1)  using  diﬀerentials:  df  = fx dx + fy  dy + fz  dz .  We  set  dy = 0  since  y  held  constant,  and  want 
�  � 
�  � 
�  � 
�  � 
�  � 
to  eliminate  dx.  For  this  we  use  the  constraint:  dg  =  gx dx + gy  dy + gz  dz  =  0,  so  setting  dy  = 0 
we  get  dx = −gz /gx dz .  Plug  into  df :  df  = −fxgz /gx dz + gz  dz ,  so  (∂ f /∂ z )y  = −fxgz /gx  + gz . 
∂ f  = 
∂x  + fz ,  while 
∂ f  ∂ z  = fx

∂ g  ∂ z  = gx 
∂ g  ∂x  + 
∂ g  ∂ y  + 
∂x  + gz
∂ g  = 
∂ z  y 
∂x  ∂ z  y 
∂ y  ∂ z  y 
∂ z  ∂ z  y 
∂ z  y 
which  gives  (∂x/∂ z )y  and  hence  the  answer.
