ab du dv = ab 
u2+v2<1 
u2+v2<1 
(x/a)2+(y/b)2<1

In  general, must  ﬁnd  out  the  scale  factor  (ratio  between  du dv  and  dx dy)? 
Example 2:  say we set u = 3x−2y , v = x+y to simplify either integrand or bounds of integration. 
What  is  the  relation  between  dA = dx dy  and  dA�  = du dv?  (area  elements  in  xy - and  uv -planes). 
Answer:  consider  a  small  rectangle  of  area  ΔA = ΔxΔy ,  it  becomes  in  uv -coordinates  a  paral­
lelogram  of  area  ΔA� .  Here  the  answer  is  independent  of  which  rectangle  we  take,  so  we  can  take

For  any  rectangle  ΔA�  =  5ΔA,  in  the  limit  dA�  = 5dA,  i.e.  du dv  = 5dx dy .  So

A  small  xy -rectangle  is  approx.  a  parallelogram  in  uv -coords,  but  scale  factor  depends  on  x  and  y 
now.  By  the  same  argument  as  before,  the  scale  factor  is  the  determinant.

looks  like  portion  of  hyperbola  (picture  shown),  parametrized  by  u  =  x.  The  bounds  are:  at  the 
top  boundary  y  =  1,  so  v/u =  1,  i.e.  u =  v ;  at  the  right  boundary,  x =  1,  so  u =  1.  So  the  inner

Besides  the picture  in xy  coordinates  (a  square  sliced by hyperbolas),  I also drew a picture  in uv 
coordinates  (a  triangle),  which  some  students  may  ﬁnd  is  an  easier  way  of  getting  the  bounds  for

Vector  ﬁelds. 
F� = M ˆı  + N ˆj ,  where  M  = M (x, y),  N  = N (x, y):  at  each  point  in  the  plane  we  have  a  vector 
F� which  depends  on  x, y . 
Examples:  velocity  ﬁelds,  e.g. wind  ﬂow  (shown:  chart  of winds  over  Paciﬁc  ocean);  force  ﬁelds, 
e.g.  gravitational  ﬁeld. 
Examples  drawn  on  blackboard:  (1)  F� =  2ˆı  + ˆj  (constant  vector  ﬁeld);  (2)  F� =  xˆı ;  (3)  F� = 
xˆı  + yˆj  (radially  outwards);  (4)  F� =  −yˆı  + xˆj  (explained  using  that  �−y , x�  is  �x, y�  rotated  90◦ 
counterclockwise).

In  fact,  the  deﬁnition  of  the  line  integral  does  not  involve  the  parametrization:  so  the  result  is 
the  same no matter which parametrization we choose.  For example we could choose  to parametrize

New notation  for  line  integral:  F� = �M , N �,  and d�r = �dx, dy�  (this  is  in  fact a diﬀerential:  if we 
divide  both  sides  by  dt  we  get  the  component  formula  for  the  velocity  d�r/dt).  So  the  line  integral

The  notation  is  dangerous:  this  is  not  a  sum  of  integrals w.r.t. x  and  y ,  but  really  a  line  integral 
along  C .  To  evaluate  one must  express  everything  in  terms  of  the  chosen  parameter.

If  F� is  a  gradient  ﬁeld,  F� =  �f  =  fxˆı  + fyˆj  (f  is  called  “potential  function”),  then  we  can

WARNING:  this  is  only  for  gradient  ﬁelds!

Physical  interpretation. 
If the force ﬁeld F� is the gradient of a potential f ,  then work of F� = change  in value of potential. 
E.g.:  1) F� = gravitational ﬁeld, f  = gravitational potential; 2) F� = electrical ﬁeld; f  = electrical 
potential  (voltage).  (Actually  physicists  use  the  opposite  sign  convention,  F� = −�f ). 
Conservativeness  means  that  energy  comes  from  change  in  potential  f ,  so  no  energy  can  be 
extracted  from  motion  along  a  closed  tra jectory  (conservativeness  =  conservation  of  energy:  the 
change  in  kinetic  energy  equals  the  work  of  the  force  equals  the  change  in  potential  energy). 
� 
We  have  four  equivalent  properties: 
� 
· 
(1)  F� is  conservative  (  C  F� d�r = 0  for  any  closed  curve  C )
· 
(2)  F  d�r  is  path  independent  (same  work  if  same  end  points) 
(3)  F� is  a  gradient  ﬁeld:  F� = �f  = fxˆı + fyˆj . 
(4) M dx + N dy  is  an  exact  diﬀerential  (= fx dx + fy  dy = df .) 
((1)  is equivalent to (2) by considering C1 , C2  with same endpoints, C  = C1 − C2  is a closed  loop. 
then  we  can  get  f (x, y)  by  computing  � (x,y) F� d�r .  (3)  and  (4)  are  reformulations  of  the  same
