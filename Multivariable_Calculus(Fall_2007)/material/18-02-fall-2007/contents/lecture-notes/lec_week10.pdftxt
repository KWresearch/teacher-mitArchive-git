Recall Green’s  theorem:  if C  is  a  closed  curve  around R  counterclockwise  then  line  integrals  can 
be  expressed  as  double  integrals:

where  curl(M ˆı + N ˆj ) = Nx  − My ,  div(P ˆı + Qˆj ) = Px  + Qy . 
For  Green’s  theorem  to  hold,  F� must  be  deﬁned  on  the  entire  region  R  enclosed  by  C .

The  problem  is  that  R  includes  0,  where  F� is  not  deﬁned. 
Deﬁnition:  a region R in the plane is simply connected if, given any closed curve in R, its interior 
region  is  entirely  contained  in  R. 
Examples  shown. 
So:  Green’s  theorem  applies  safely  when  the  domain  in  which  F� is  deﬁned  and  diﬀerentiable  is 
simply  connected:  then  we  automatically  know  that,  if  F� is  deﬁned  on  C ,  then  it’s  also  deﬁned  in 
the  region  bounded  by  C . 
In  the  above  example,  can’t  apply  Green  to  the  unit  circle,  because  the  domain  of  deﬁnition 
of  F� is  not  simply  connected.  Still,  we  can  apply  Green’s  theorem  to  an  annulus  (picture  shown 
of  a  curve  C � = unit  circle  counterclockwise  +  segment  along  x-axis  +  small  circle  around  origin 
� 
�� 
�
�
� 
clockwise + back  to  the unit  circle allong  the x-axis,  enclosing an annulus R� ).  Then Green applies 
and  says  C �  F� · d�r =  R�  0 dA = 0;  but  line  integral  simpliﬁes  to  C �  =  C  −  C2 
,  where  C  =  unit 
circle,  C2  =  small  circle  /  origin;  so  line  integral  is  actually  the  same  on  C  and  C2  (or  any  other 
curve  encircling  the  origin).

To set up bounds, (1) for ﬁxed (x, y) ﬁnd bounds for z :  here lower limit is z = x2 + y2 , upper limit 
is z = 4 − x2 − y2 ;  (2) ﬁnd the shadow of R onto the xy -plane,  i.e. set of values of (x, y) above which 
region lies.  Here:  R is widest at intersection of paraboloids, which is in plane z = 2; general method: 
for  which  (x, y)  is  z  on  top  surface  > z  on  bottom  surface?  Answer:  when  4 − x2  − y2  > x2  − y2 ,
