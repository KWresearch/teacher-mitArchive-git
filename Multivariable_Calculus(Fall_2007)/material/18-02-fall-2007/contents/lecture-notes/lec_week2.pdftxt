Matrices.  Often  quantities  are  related  by  linear  transformations;  e.g.  changing  coordinate

systems,  from  P  = (x1 , x2 , x3 )  to  something  more  adapted  to  the  problem,  with  new  coordinates 
(u1 , u2 , u3 ).  For  example

Entries  in  the  matrix  product  =  dot  product  between  rows  of  A  and  columns  of  X .  (here  we 
multiply  a  3x3 matrix  by  a  column  vector  =  3x1 matrix). 
More  generally, matrix multiplication  AB :  ⎡

(Also  explained  one  can  set  up  A  to  the  left,  B  to  the  top,  then  each  entry  of  AB  =  dot  product 
between  row  to  its  left  and  column  above  it). 
Note:  for  this  to make  sense,  width  of  A must  equal  height  of  B . 
What  AB  means:  BX  =  apply  transformation  B  to  vector  X ,  so  (AB )X  =  A(BX )  =  apply 
ﬁrst B  then A.  (so matrix multiplication  is  like  composing  transformations, but  from  right  to  left!)

(Remark:  matrix product  is not  commutative, AB  is  in general not  the  same as BA – one of  the 
two  need  not  even make  sense  if  sizes  not  compatible).

Inverse  matrix.  Inverse  of  a  matrix  A  (necessarily  square)  is  a  matrix  M  =  A−1  such  that 
AM  = M A = In . 
A−1  corresponds  to  the  reciprocal  linear  relation. 
E.g.,  solution  to  linear  system  AX  = U :  can  solve  for  X  as  function  of  U  by  X  = A−1U .

Equations  of  planes.  Recall  an  equation  of  the  form  ax + by + cz = d  deﬁnes  a  plane. 
1)  plane  through  origin  with  normal  vector  N  =  �1, 5, 10�:  P  = (x, y , z )  is  in  the  plane  ⇔ 
−−→
OP· 
= 0  ⇔ �1, 5, 10� · �x, y , z �  =  x + 5y  +  10z  =  0.  Coeﬃcients  of  the  equation  are  the
N 
components  of  the  normal  vector. 
2) plane through P0  = (2, 1, −1) with same normal vector N  = �1, 5, 10�:  parallel to the previous 
−−→
one!  P  is  in  the  plane ⇔ N  · P0P  = 0 ⇔  (x − 2) + 5(y − 1) + 10(z + 1) = 0,  or  x + 5y + 10z = −3.
Again  coeﬃcients  of  equation  =  components  of  normal  vector. 
(Note:  the  equation multiplied  by  a  constant  still  deﬁnes  the  same  plane). 

So,  to  ﬁnd  the  equation  of  a  plane,  we  really  need  to  look  for  the  normal  vector N ;  we  can  e.g. 
ﬁnd  it  by  cross-product  of  2  vectors  that  are  in  the  plane. 
Flashcard  question:  the  vector  v  =  �1, 2, −1�  and  the  plane  x + y + 3z  =  5  are  1)  parallel,  2) 
perpendicular,  3)  neither? 
perpendicular  vector  would  be  proportional  to the  coeﬃcients,  i.e.  to  �1, 1, 3�;  let’s  test  if 
(A
it’s   in  the  plane:  equivalent  to  being  ⊥  N .  We  have  v N  = 1 + 2 − 3 = 0  so  v  is  parallel  to 
· 
the  plane.)
Interpretation  of  3x3  systems.  A  3x3  system  asks  for  the  intersection  of  3  planes.  Two 
planes  intersect  in a  line,  and usually  the  third plane  intersects  it  in a  single point  (picture  shown). 
The  unique  solution  to  AX  = B  is  given  by  X  = A−1B .

Exception:  if  the  3rd  plane  is  parallel  to  the  line  of  intersection  of  the  ﬁrst  two?  What  can 
happen?  (asked  on  ﬂashcards  for  possibilities). 
If   the  line  P1  ∩ P2  is  contained  in  P3  there  are  inﬁnitely many  solutions  (the line);  if  it  is 
 
 
 
P3  there  are  no  solutions.  (could  also  get  a  plane  of  solutions  if  all  three  equations
parallel  to
 
  are  the  same) 
These  special  cases  correspond  to  systems with  det(A) = 0.  Then we  can’t  invert A  to  solve  the 
A) adj(A).  Theorem:  A  is  invertible ⇔  det A = 0.
system:  recall  A−1  =  det(
1 
Homogeneous  systems:  AX  =  0.  Then  all  3  planes  pass  through  the  origin,  so  there  is  the 
obvious  (”trivial”)  solution  X  =  0.  If  det A  =�
0  then  this  solution  is  unique:  X  =  A−1 0  =  0. 
Otherwise,  if  det A = 0  there  are  inﬁnitely many  solutions  (forming  a  line  or  a  plane). 
Note:  det A = 0  means  det(N 1 , N 2 , N 3 ) = 0,  where N i  are  the  normals  to  the  planes  Pi .  This 
means  the parallelepiped  formed by  the N i  has no area,  i.e.  they are  coplanar  (showed picture of 3 
planes intersecting in a line, and their coplanar normals).  The line of solutions is then perpendicular 
to the plane containing N i .  For example we can get a vector along the line of intersection by taking 
a  cross-product N 1  × N 2 . 
General  systems:  AX  =  B :  compared  to  AX  =  0,  all  the  planes  are  shifted  to  parallel 
positions  from  their  initial  ones.  If  det A  =�
0  then  unique  solution  is  X  =  A−1B .  If  det A  =  0, 
either  there  are  inﬁnitely many  solutions  or  there  are  no  solutions. 
(We  don’t  have  tools  to  decide  whether  it’s  inﬁnitely  many  or  none,  although  elimination  will 
let  us  ﬁnd  out).

Lines.  We’ve seen a line as intersection of 2 planes.  Other representation = parametric equation 
=  as  tra jectory  of  a moving  point. 
E.g.  line through Q0  = (−1, 2, 2), Q1  = (1, 3, −1):  moving point Q(t) starts at Q0  at t = 0, moves 
−−−−−→

⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ 
at  constant  speed  along  line,  reaches  Q1  at  t  =  1:  its  “velocity”  is  �v  = 
Q0Q1  ; 
Q0Q(t) =  t
Q0Q1  .
On  example:  �x + 1, y − 2, z − 2� = t�2, 1, −3�,  i.e. 
x(t) = −1 + 2t, 
y(t) = 2 + t, 
z (t) = 2 − 3t 
Lines  and  planes.  Understand  where  lines  and  planes  intersect.

Flashcard  question:  relative  positions  of  Q0 , Q1  with  respect  to  plane  x + 2y + 4z  =  7?  (same

side,  opposite  sides,  one  is  in  the  plane,  can’t  tell). 
(A  sizeable  number  of  students  erroneously  answered  that  one  is  in  the  plane.) 
Answer:  plug coordinates into equation of plane:  at Q0 , x+ 2y + 4z = 11 > 7; at Q1 , x+ 2y + 4z = 
3 < 7;  so  opposite  sides. 
Intersection of  line Q0Q1  with plane?  When does the moving point Q(t)  lie  in the plane?  Check: 
at  Q(t),  x + 2y + 4z  = (−1 + 2t) + 2(2 + t) + 4(2 − 3t) =  11 − 8t,  so  condition  is  11 − 8t =  7,  or 
2 ) = (0,  5/2,  1/2). 
t = 1/2.  Intersection  point:  Q(t =  1
 (What would happen  if  the  line was  parallel  to  the  plane,  or  inside  it.  Answer:  when 
plugging  the  coordinates  of Q(t)  into  the  plane  equation  we’d  get  a  constant,  equal  to  7  if  the  line 
is contained  in the plane – so all values of  t are solutions – or to something else  if the  line  is parallel 
to  the  plane  –  so  there  are  no  solutions.)

General  parametric  curves. 
Example:  cycloid:  wheel  rolling  on  ﬂoor,  motion  of  a  point  P  on  the  rim.  (Drew  picture,  then 
showed  an  applet  illustrating  the  motion  and  plotting  the  cycloid). 
Position of P ?  Choice of parameter:  e.g., θ ,  the angle the wheel has  turned since  initial position. 
Distance  wheel  has  travelled  is  equal  to  arclength  on  circumference  of  the  circle  =  aθ . 
Setup:  x-axis =  ﬂoor,  initial  position  of  P  =  origin;  introduce  A =  point  of  contact  of  wheel  on
