Physical  interpretation.  div F  =  source  rate  =  ﬂux  generated  per  unit  volume.  Imagine 
an  incompressible  ﬂuid  ﬂow  (i.e.  a  given  mass  occupies  a  ﬁxed  volume)  with  velocity  F,  then

Sides:  sides  are  vertical,  nˆ is  horizontal,  F  is  vertical  so  ﬂux  =  0.

Given  any  region  D ,  decompose  it  into  vertically  simple  pieces  (illustrated  for  a  donut).  Then

where  u(x, y , z , t)  =  concentration  of  smoke;  we’ll  also  introduce  F  =  ﬂow  of  the  smoke.  It’s  also 
the  heat  equation  (u  =  temperature). 
Equation  uses  two  inputs: 
1)  Physics:  F  =  −k�u  (ﬂow  goes  from  highest  to  lowest  concentration,  faster  if  concentration

Same  average  values  over  any  region;  taking  limit  as  D  shrinks  to  a  point,  get  ∂u/∂ t = −div F. 
Combining,  we  get  the  diﬀusion  equation:  ∂u/∂ t = −div F = +kdiv (�u) = k�2u.
