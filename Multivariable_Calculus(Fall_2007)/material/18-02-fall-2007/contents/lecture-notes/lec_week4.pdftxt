Functions  of  several  variables. 
Recall:  for  a  function  of  1  variable,  we  can  plot  its  graph,  and  the  derivative  is  the  slope  of  the 
tangent  line  to  the  graph. 
Plotting  graphs  of  functions  of  2  variables:  examples  z  =  −y ,  z  = 1 − x2  − y2 ,  using  slices  by 
the  coordinate  planes.  (derived  carefully). 
Contour  plot:  level  curves  f (x, y) = c.  Amounts  to  slicing  the  graph  by  horizontal  planes  z = c. 
Showed  2  examples  from  “real  life”:  a  topographical map,  and  a  temperature map,  then  did  the 
examples  z  =  −y  and  z  = 1 − x2  − y2 .  Showed  more  examples  of  computer  plots  (z  =  x2  + y2 , 
z = y2  − x2 ,  and  another  one). 
Contour  plot  gives  some  qualitative  info  about  how  f  varies  when  we  change  x, y .  (shown  an 
example  where  increasing  x  leads  f  to  increase). 
Partial  derivatives.

Geometric  interpretation:  fx , fy  are  slopes  of  tangent  lines  of  vertical  slices  of  the  graph  of  f 
(ﬁxing  y = y0 ;  ﬁxing  x = x0 ). 
How  to  compute:  treat  x  as  variable,  y  as  constant. 
Example:  f (x, y) = x3y + y2 ,  then  fx  = 3x2y ,  fy  = x3  + 2y .

Linear  approximation 
Interpretation  of  fx ,  fy  as  slopes  of  slices  of  the  graph  by  planes  parallel  to  xz  and  yz  planes. 
Linear  approximation  formula:  Δf  ≈ fxΔx + fyΔy . 
Justiﬁcation:  fx  and  fy  give  slopes  of  two  lines  tangent  to  the  graph: 
y = y0 , z = z0  + fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 )  and  x = x0 , z = z0  + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ). 
We  can  use  this  to  get  the  equation  of  the  tangent  plane  to  the  graph: 
z = z0  + fx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + fy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ). 
Approximation  formula  =  the  graph  is  close  to  its  tangent  plane. 

Min/max  problems. 
At  a  local  max  or  min,  fx  =  0  and  fy  =  0  (since  (x0 , y0 )  is  a  local  max  or  min  of  the  slice). 
Because  2  lines  determine  tangent  plane,  this  is  enough  to  ensure  that  tangent  plane  is  horizontal 
(approximation  formula:  Δf  � 0,  or  rather,  |Δf | � |Δx|, |Δy |). 
Def  of  critical  point:  (x0 , y0 )  where  fx  = 0  and  fy  = 0. 
A  critical  point  may  be  a  local min,  local max,  or  saddle. 
Example:  f (x, y) = x2  − 2xy + 3y2  + 2x − 2y . 
Critical  point:  fx  = 2x − 2y + 2 =  0,  fy  = −2x + 6y − 2 =  0,  gives  (x0 , y0 ) = (−1, 0)  (only  one 
critical  point).

Is  it  a max, min  or  saddle?  (pictures  shown  of  each  type).  Systematic  answer:  next  lecture. 
For  today:  observe  f  = (x − y)2  + 2y2  + 2x − 2y = (x − y + 1)2  + 2y2  − 1 ≥ −1,  so minimum. 
Least  squares.

Set  up  problem:  experimental  data  (xi , yi ) (i = 1, . . . , n),  want  to  ﬁnd  a  best-ﬁt  line  y = ax + b 
(the  unknowns  here  are  a, b,  not  x, y !) 
Deviations:  yi − (axi + b); want  to minimize  the  total  square  deviation D =

y  =  ceax  (taking  logarithms:  ln y  =  ln c + ax,  so  setting  b  =  ln c  we  reduce  to  linear  case);  or 
quadratic  laws  y  = ax2  + bx + c  (minimizing  total  square  deviation  leads  to  a  3 × 3  linear  system 
for  a, b, c). 
Example:  Moore’s  Law  (number  of  transistors  on  a  computer  chip  increases  exponentially  with 
time):  showed  interpolation  line  on  a  log  plot.

Second  derivative  test. 
Recall  critical  points  can  be  local  min  (w  =  x2  + y2 ),  local  max  (w  =  −x2  − y2 ),  saddle  (w  = 
y2  − x2 );  slides  shown  of  each  type. 
Goal:  determine  type  of  a  critical  point,  and  ﬁnd  the  global  min/max. 
Note:  global  min/max  may  be  either  at  a  critical  point,  or  on  the  boundary  of  the  domain/at 
inﬁnity. 

We  start  with  the  case  of  w = ax2  + bxy + cy2 ,  at  (0, 0). 
Example from Tuesday:  w = x2 − 2xy + 3y2 :  completing the square, w = (x− y)2 + 2y2 , minimum.

3  cases:  if  4ac −  b2  >  0,  same  signs,  if  a >  0  then  minimum,  if  a <  0  then  maximum;  if 
a( x )2  + b( x ) + c � 
This  is  related  to  the  quadratic  formula:  w = y 2 � 
4ac − b2  < 0,  opposite  signs,  saddle;  if  4ac − b2  = 0,  degenerate  case.

If b2 − 4ac < 0 then no roots, so at2 + bt+ c has a constant sign, and w  is either always nonnegative 
or  always nonpositive  (min  or max).  If  b2 − 4ac > 0  then at2 + bt + c  crosses  zero  and  changes  sign, 
so  w  can  have  both  signs,  saddle. 

General  case:  second  derivative  test. 
∂ 2f
We  look  at  second  derivatives:  fxx  =
,  fxy ,  fyx ,  fyy .  Fact:  fxy  = fyx . 
∂x2 
Given  f  and  a  critical  point  (x0 , y0 ),  set  A = fxx (x0 , y0 ),  B = fxy (x0 , y0 ),  C  = fyy (x0 , y0 ),  then: 
–  if  AC − B 2  > 0  then:  if  A > 0  (or  C ),  local min;  if  A < 0,  local max. 
–  if  AC − B 2  < 0  then  saddle.

–  if  AC − B 2  = 0  then  can’t  conclude.

Checked  quadratic  case  (fxx  = 2a = A,  fxy  = b = B ,  fyy  = 2c = C ,  then  AC − B 2  = 4ac − b2 ). 

General  justiﬁcation:  quadratic  approximation  formula  (Taylor  series  at  order  2):

Δf  � fx (x − x0 ) + fy  (y − y0 ) +  1 fxx (x − x0 )2  + fxy  (x − x0 )(y − y0 ) +  1 fyy  (y − y0 )2 .

At a critical point, Δf  �  A (x − x0 )2 + B (x − x0 )(y − y0 ) + C (y − y0 )2 .  In degenerate case, would 
2

need  higher  order  derivatives  to  conclude. 
NOTE:  the  global  min/max  of  a  function  is  not  necessarily  at  a  critical  point!  Need  to  check 
boundary  /  inﬁnity. 
Example:  f (x, y) = x + y +  xy ,  for  x > 0,  y > 0. 
1
fx  = 1 −  1 
2 = 0,  fy  = 1 −  1 
2  = 0.  So  x2y = 1,  xy2  = 1,  only  critical  point  is  (1, 1).
x y 
xy

fxx  = 2/x3y ,  fxy  = 1/x2y2 ,  fyy  = 2/xy3 .  So  A = 2,  B = 1,  C  = 2.

Question:  type  of  critical  point?  Answer:  AC − B 2  = 2  2 − 1 > 0,  A = 2 > 0,  local min.

· 
What  about  the  maximum?  Answer:  f  → ∞  near  boundary  (x → 0  or  y → 0)  and  at  inﬁnity.
