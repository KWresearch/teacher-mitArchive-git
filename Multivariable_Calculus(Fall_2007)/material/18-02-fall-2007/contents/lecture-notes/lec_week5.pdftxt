Diﬀerentials.

dy = f � (x) dx.  Example:  y = sin−1 (x)

Recall in single variable calculus:  y = f (x) 
x = sin y , 
1 − x
dx = cos y dy ,  so  dy/dx = 1/ cos y = 1/

Total  diﬀerential:  f  = f (x, y , z ) 
df  = fx dx + fy  dy + fz  dz .
This  is  a  new  type  of  ob ject,  with  its  own  rules  for  manipulating  it  (df  is  not  the  same  as  Δf ! 
The  textbook  has  it  wrong.)  It  encodes  how  variations  of  f  are  related  to  variations  of  x, y , z .  We 
can  use  it  in  two  ways: 
1.  as  a  placeholder  for  approximation  formulas:  Δf  ≈ fxΔx + fyΔy + fzΔz . 
2.  divide  by  dt  to  get  the  chain  rule:  if  x = x(t),  y = y(t),  z = z (t),  then  f  becomes  a  function

Example:  w = x2y + z ,  dw = 2xy dx + x2 dy + dz .  If  x = t,  y = et ,  z = sin t  then  the  chain  rule 
gives  dw/dt =  (2tet ) 1 + (t2 ) et  + cos t,  same  as  what  we  obtain  by  substitution  into  formula  for  w 
and  one-variable  diﬀerentiation. 
Can  justify  the  chain  rule  in  2  ways: 
1.  dx =  x� (t) dt,  dy  =  y � (t) dt,  dz  =  z � (t) dt,  so  substituting  we  get  dw  =  fxdx + fy dy + fz dz  = 
fx x� (t) dt + fy  y � (t) dt + fz  z � (t) dt,  hence  dw/dt. 
2.  (more  rigorous):  Δw  �  fxΔx + fyΔy + fzΔz ,  divide  both  sides  by  Δt  and  take  limit  as 
0.→ 
Δt 
Applications  of  chain  rule: 
Product  and  quotient  formulas  for  derivatives:  f  =  uv ,  u  =  u(t),  v  =  v(t),  then  d(uv)/dt  = 
fu u� + fv  v �  = vu� + uv � .  Similarly with g = u/v , d(u/v)/dt = gu u� + gv  v �  = (1/v) u� + (−u/v2 ) v �  = 
(u�v − uv � )/v2 . 
Chain  rule  with  more  variables:  for  example  w  =  f (x, y),  x  =  x(u, v),  y  =  y(u, v).  Then 
dw  =  fx dx + fy  dy  =  fx (xudu + xv dv) + fy (yudu + yv dv) = (fxxu  + fy yu ) du + (fxxv  + fy yv ) dv . 
Identifying  coeﬃcients  of  du  and  dv  we  get  ∂ f /∂u  =  fxxu  +  fy yu  and  similarly  for  ∂ f /∂ v .

Example:  polar  coordinates:  x = r cos θ ,  y = r sin θ .  Then  fr  = fxxr  + fy yr  = cos θ fx + sin θ fy ,

Deﬁnition:  �w = �wx , wy , wz �  –  GRADIENT  VECTOR.

Theorem:  �w  is  perpendicular  to  the  level  surfaces  w = c.

Example  1:  w = ax + by + cz ,  then  w = d  is  a  plane  with  normal  vector �w = �a, b, c�.

Example  2:  w = x2  + y2 ,  then  w = c  are  circles, �w = �2x, 2y�  points  radially  out  so  ⊥  circles. 

Example  3:  w = x2  − y2 ,  shown  on  applet  (Lagrange  multipliers  applet  with  g  disabled).

 �w  is  a  vector  whose  value  depends  on  the  point  (x, y)  where  we  evaluate  w.

 

Proof:  take  a  curve  �r = �r(t)  contained  inside  level  surface  w =  c.  Then  velocity  �v  = d�r/dt  is  in 
the  tangent  plane,  and  by  chain  rule,  dw/dt = �w · d�r/dt = 0,  so �v ⊥ �w.  This  is  true  for  every �v 
in  the  tangent  plane. 
Application:  tangent  plane  to  a  surface.  Example:  tangent  plane  to  x2 + y2 − z 2  = 4  at  (2, 1, 1): 
� 
gradient  is  �2x, 2y , −2z � = �4, 2, −2�;  tangent  plane  is  4x + 2y − 2z  = 8.  (Here  we  could  also  solve 
for  z =  x2  + y2  − 4  and  use  linear  approximation  formula,  but  in  general  we  can’t.) 
(Another  way  to  get  the  tangent  plane:  dw  = 2x dx + 2y dy − 2z dz  = 4dx + 2dy − 2dz .  So 
Δw  ≈  4Δx  +  2Δy  −  2Δz .  The  level  surface  is  Δw  =  0,  its  tangent  plane  approximation  is 
4Δx + 2Δy − 2Δz = 0,  i.e.  4(x − 2) + 2(y − 1) − 2(z − 1) = 0,  same  as  above). 
Directional  derivative.  Rate  of  change  of  w  as  we  move  (x, y)  in  an  arbitrary  direction. 
Take  a  unit  vector  ˆu =  �a, b�,  and  look  at  straight  line  tra jectory  �r(s)  with  velocity  ˆu,  given  by 
x(s) = x0  + as,  y(s) = y0  + bs.  (unit  speed,  so  s  is  arclength!)

Geometrically:  slice of graph by a vertical plane (not parallel to x or y axes anymore).  Directional 
derivative  is  the  slope.  Shown  on  applet  (Functions  of  two  variables),  with  w  =  x2  + y2  + 1,  and 
rotating  slices  through  a  point  of  the  graph.

Geometric  interpretation:  dw/ds  =  �w uˆ =  |�w| cos θ .  Maximal  for  cos θ  =  1,  when  ˆu  is  in

direction of �w.  Hence:  direction of �w  is that of  fastest  increase of w, and  |�w|  is the directional 
derivative  in  that  direction.  We  have  dw/ds = 0 when  ˆu ⊥ �w,  i.e.  when  ˆu  is  tangent  to  direction 
of  level  surface.

Lagrange  multipliers.

Problem:  min/max  when  variables  are  constrained  by  an  equation  g(x, y , z ) = c. 
Example:  ﬁnd  point  of  xy  =  3  closest  to  origin  ?  I.e.  minimize  x2  + y2 ,  or  better  f (x, y) = 
x2  + y2 ,  sub ject  to  g(x, y) = xy = 3.  Illustrated  using  Lagrange  multipliers  applet. 
Observe  on  picture:  at  the  minimum,  the  level  curves  are  tangent  to  each  other,  so  the  normal 
vectors  f�

are parallel.

So:  there  exists  λ  (“multiplier”)  such  that  �f  =  λ�g .  We  replace  the  constrained  min/max

In  general  solving may be hard  and  require  a  computer.  Here,  linear  algebra: 
−λx + 2y = 0

Why  the  method  works:  at  constrained  min/max,  moving  in  any  direction  along  the  constraint

uˆ ⊥ �f .  Therefore  �f  is  normal  to  tangent  plane  to  g  =  c,  and  so  is  �g ,  hence  the  gradient 
vectors  are  parallel. 
Warning:  method doesn’t say whether we have a min or a max, and second derivative test doesn’t 
apply with constrained variables.  Need to answer using geometric argument or by comparing values 
of  f .

We  can  set  up  problem  in  coordinates:  base  vertices  P1  = (x1 , y1 , 0),  P2 ,  P3 ,  and  top  vertex

Key  idea:  use  variables  adapted  to  the  geometry,  instead  of  (x, y):  let  a1 , a2 , a3  =  lengths  of
