Velocity  and  acceleration.  Last  time:  position  vector  �r(t) = x(t)ˆı + y(t)ˆj  [+z (t)kˆ ].

E.g.,  cycloid:  �r(t) = �t − sin t, 1 − cos t�.

Kepler’s  2nd  law.  (illustration  of  eﬃciency  of  vector methods) Kepler  1609,  laws  of  planetary 
motion:  the  motion  of  planets  is  in  a  plane,  and  area  is  swept  out  by  the  line  from  the  sun  to  the 
planet  at  a  constant  rate.  Newton  (about  70  years  later)  explained  this  using  laws  of  gravitational 
attraction. 
Kepler’s  law  in  vector  form:  area  swept  out  in  Δt  is  area  ≈

So  Kepler’s  law ⇔  �r × �v  =  constant ⇔  �r × �a = 0 ⇔ �a//�r  ⇔  the  force  F� is  central.

(so  Kepler’s  law  really  means  the  force  is  directed  //�r ;  it  also  applies  to  other  central  forces  –

e.g.  electric  charges.)

Review.  Material  on  the  test =  everything  seen  in  lecture.  The  exam  is  similar  to  the  practice 
exams,  or  very  slightly  harder.  The  main  topics  are  (Problem  numbers  refer  to  Practice  1A): 
1)  vectors,  dot  product.  A · B = |A||B | cos θ = 
ai bi .  Finding  angles.  (e.g.  Problem  1.)

2 |A × B |;  equations  of  planes  (coeﬃcients  of  equation 
2)  cross-product,  area  of  space  triangles  1
=  components  of  normal  vector)  (e.g.  Problem  5.) 
3) matrices,  inverse  matrix,  linear  systems  (e.g.  Problem  3.) 
4)  ﬁnding  parametric  equations  by  decomposing  position  vector  as  a  sum;  velocity,  acceleration; 
diﬀerentiating  vector  identities  (e.g.  Problems  2,4,6).
