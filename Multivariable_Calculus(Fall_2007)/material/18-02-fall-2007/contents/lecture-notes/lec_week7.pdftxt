Recall  integral  in  1-variable  calculus:  � 
Double  integrals.

Now:  double  integral  R f (x, y) dA  =  volume  below  graph  z = f (x, y)  over  plane  region  R.

Cut  R  into  small  pieces  ΔA 
the  volume  is  approximately 
f (xi , yi ) ΔAi .  Limit  as  ΔA 
gives  R f (x, y) dA.  (picture  shown)

How  to  compute  the  integral?  By  taking  slices:  S (x)  =  area  of  the  slice  by  a  plane  parallel  to 
yz -plane  (picture  shown):  then

In  the  inner  integral,  x  is  a  ﬁxed  parameter,  y  is  the  integration  variable.  We  get  an  iterated 
integral. 
Example  1:  z = 1 − x2  − y2 ,  region  0 ≤ x ≤ 1,  0 ≤ y ≤ 1  (picture  shown):

How to ﬁnd the bounds of  integration?  Fix x constant:  what  is a slice parallel to y -axis?  bounds

3)  moment  of  inertia:  physical  equivalent  of  mass  for  rotational  motion.  (mass  =  how  hard 
it  is  to  impart  translation  motion;  moment  of  inertia  about  some  axis  =  same  for  rotation  motion 
around  that  axis)
