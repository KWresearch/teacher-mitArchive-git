Spherical  coordinates  (ρ, φ, θ). 
ρ =  rho =  distance  to  origin.  φ = ϕ =  phi =  angle  down  from  z -axis.  θ  =  same  as  in  cylindrical 
coordinates.  Diagram drawn in space, and picture of 2D slice by vertical plane with z , r coordinates.

On  the  surface  of  the  sphere,  φ  is  similar  to  latitude,  except  it’s  0  at  the  north  pole,  π/2  on  the 
equator,  π  at  the  south  pole.  θ  is  similar  to  longitude. 
φ = π/4  is  a  cone  (asked  using  ﬂash  cards)  (z = r =  x2  + y2 ).  φ = π/2  is  the  xy-plane. 

Volume  element:  dV  = ρ2 sin φ dρ dφ dθ . 
To  understand  this  formula,  ﬁrst  study  surface  area  on  sphere  of  radius  a:  picture  shown  of  a 
“rectangle” corresponding to Δφ, Δθ , with sides = portion of circle of radius a, of  length aΔφ, and 
portion  of  circle  of  radius  r  =  a sin φ,  of  length  rΔθ  =  a sin φΔθ .  So ΔS  ≈  a2 sin φ ΔφΔθ ,  which 
gives  the  surface  element  dS  = a2 sin φ dφdθ . 
The  volume  element  follows:  for  a  small  “box”, ΔV  = ΔS Δρ,  so  dV  = dρ dS  = ρ2 sin φ dρdφdθ . 

Example:  recall  the  complicated  example  at  end  of  Friday’s  lecture  (region  sliced  by  a  plane 
√
inside unit  sphere).  After  rotating coordinate  system,  the question becomes:  volume of  the portion 
2?  (picture  drawn).  This  can  be  set  up  in  cylindrical  (left 
of  unit  sphere  above  the  plane  z  = 1/
as  exercise)  or  spherical  coordinates. 
√
For  ﬁxed  φ, θ  we  are  slicing  our  region  by  rays  straight  out  of  the  origin;  ρ  ranges  from  its  value

If  instead  of  a  point  mass  we  have  a  solid  with  density  δ ,  then  we  must  integrate  contributions

If  we  can  set  up  to  use  symmetry,  then  Fz  can  be  computed  nicely  using  spherical  coordinates. 
General  setup:  place  the  mass  m  at  the  origin  (so  integrand  is  as  above),  and  place  the  solid 
so  that  the  z -axis  is  an  axis  of  symmetry.  Then  F� = �0, 0, Fz �  by  symmetry,  and  we  have  only  one

Vector  ﬁelds  in  space. 
At  every  point  in  space,  F� = P ˆı + Qˆj + Rkˆ ,  where  P , Q, R  are  functions  of  x, y , z .

Flux.

Recall:  in  2D,  ﬂux  of  a  vector  ﬁeld  F� across  a  curve  C  =  C  F� nˆ ds.

In  3D,  ﬂux  of  a  vector  ﬁeld  is  a  double  integral:  ﬂux  through  a  surface,  not  a  curve!

Notation:  dS� = nˆ dS .  (We’ll  see  that  dS� is  often  easier  to  compute  than  nˆ and  dS ). 
Remark:  there  are  2  choices  for  nˆ (choose  which  way  is  counted  positively!) 

Geometric  interpretation  of  ﬂux: 
As  in  2D,  if  F� =  velocity  of  a  ﬂuid  ﬂow,  then  ﬂux  =  ﬂow  per  unit  time  across  S . 
Cut  S  into  small  pieces,  then  over  each  small  piece:  what  passes  through ΔS  in  unit  time  is  the 
contents  of  a  parallelepiped  with  base  ΔS  and  third  side  given  by  F� .

Setup.  Sometimes  we  have  an  easy  geometric  argument,  but  in  general  we  must  compute  the 
· 
surface  integral.  The  setup  requires  the use of  two parameters  to describe  the  surface,  and F� nˆ dS
must  be  expressed  in  terms  of  them.  How  to  do  this  depends  on  the  type  of  surface.  For  now, 
formulas  to  remember: 
0) plane z = a parallel to xy -plane:  nˆ = ±kˆ , dS  = dx dy .  (similarly for planes // xz or yz -plane). 
1 �x, y , z �, 
1) sphere of radius a centered at origin:  use φ, θ  (substitute ρ = a  for evaluation); nˆ =  a 
dS  = a2 sin φ dφ dθ . 
2) cylinder of  radius a centered on z -axis:  use z , θ  (substitute r = a  for evaluation):  nˆ is  radially 
1 �x, y , 0�;  and  dS  =  a dz dθ  (explained  by 
out  in  horizontal  directions  away  from  z -axis,  i.e.  nˆ =  a 
drawing  a  picture  of  a  “rectangular”  piece  of  cylinder, ΔS  = (Δz ) (aΔθ)). 
3)  graph  z  =  f (x, y):  use  x, y  (substitute  z  =  f (x, y)).  We’ll  see  on  Friday  that  nˆ and  dS 
separately  are  complicated,  but  nˆ dS  = �−fx , −fy , 1� dx dy .

Last  time,  we  deﬁned  the  ﬂux  of  F� through  surface  S  as 
various  cases.  Continue  with more: 
Flux  through  a  graph.  If  S  is  the  graph  of  some  function  z  =  f (x, y)  over  a  region  R  of 
xy -plane:  use  x  and  y  as  variables.  Contribution  of  a  small  piece  of  S  to  ﬂux  integral? 
Consider  portion  of S  lying  above  a  small  rectangle Δx Δy  in xy -plane.  In  linear  approximation 
it  is  a  parallelogram.  (picture  shown) 
The  vertices  are  (x, y , f (x, y));  (x + Δx, y , f (x + Δx, y));  (x, y + Δy , f (x, y + Δy));  etc.  Linear 
approximation:  f (x + Δx, y) � f (x, y) + Δx fx (x, y),  and  f (x, y + Δy) � f (x, y) + Δy fy (x, y). 
������ 
������ 
So  the  sides  of  the  parallelogram  are  �Δx, 0, Δx fx �  and  �0, Δy , Δy fy �,  and

Implicit  surfaces:  If we  have  an  implicitly  deﬁned  surface  g(x, y , z ) = 0,  then we  have  a  (non­

N = �a, b, c�). 
Unit  normal  nˆ =  ±N/|N|;  surface  element  ΔS  =  ?  Look  at  pro jection  to  xy -plane:  ΔA  = 
ΔS cos α  = (N  · kˆ /|N|) ΔS  (where  α  =  angle  between  slanted  surface  element  and  horizontal: 
pro jection  shrinks  one  direction  by  factor  cos α = (N · kˆ )/|N|,  preserves  the  other).

Example:  if  S  is  a  graph,  g(x, y , z ) =  z − f (x, y)  =  0,  then  N  =  �gx , gy , gz �  =  �−fx , −fy , 1�,
