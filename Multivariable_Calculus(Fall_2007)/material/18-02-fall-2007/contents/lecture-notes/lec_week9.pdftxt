Test  for  gradient  ﬁelds. 
Observe:  if  F� = M ˆı  + N ˆj  is  a  gradient  ﬁeld  then  Nx  = My .  Indeed,  if  F� = �f  then  M  =  fx , 
N  = fy ,  so  Nx  = fyx  = fxy  = My . 
Claim:  Conversely,  if  F� is  deﬁned  and  diﬀerentiable  at  every  point  of  the  plane,  and  Nx  = My , 
then  F� = M ˆı + N ˆj  is  a  gradient  ﬁeld. 
Example:  F� = −yˆı + xˆj :  Nx  = 1, My  = −1,  so  F� is  not  a  gradient  ﬁeld. 
Example:  for  which  value(s)  of  a  is  F� =  (4x2  + axy)ˆı  + (3y2  + 4x2 )ˆj  a  gradient  ﬁeld?  Answer: 
Nx  = 8x, My  = ax,  so  a = 8.

Then 

Finding  the  potential:  if  above  test  says  F� is  a  gradient  ﬁeld,  we  have  2 methods  to  ﬁnd  the 
potential  function  f .  Illustrated  for  the  above  example  (taking  a = 8): 
� 
Method  1:  using  line  integrals  (FTC  backwards): 
We  know  that  if  C  starts  at  (0, 0)  and  ends  at  (x1 , y1 )  then  f (x1 , y1 ) − f (0, 0) = 
· 
F� d�r .  Here 
C 
f (0, 0)  is  just  an  integration  constant  (if  f  is  a  potential  then  so  is  f  + c).  Can  also  choose  the 
simplest  curve  C  from  (0, 0)  to  (x1 , y1 ). 
� 
� 
Simplest  choice:  take  C  =  portion  of  x-axis  from  (0, 0)  to  (x1 , 0),  then  vertical  segment  from 
(x1 , 0)  to  (x1 , y1 )  (picture  drawn).

So  f (x1 , y1 ) =  x 3

Method  2:  using  antiderivatives: 
We  want  f (x, y)  such  that  (1)  fx  = 4x2  + 8xy ,  (2)  fy  = 3y2  + 4x2 . 
4 x3  + 4x2y+ 
Taking  antiderivative  of  (1)  w.r.t.  x  (treating  y  as  a  constant),  we  get  f (x, y) =  3
integration  constant  (independent  of  x).  The  integration  constant  still  depends  on  y ,  call  it  g(y). 
3 x3  + 4x2y + g(y).  Take  partial  w.r.t.  y ,  to  get  fy  = 4x2  + g � (y). 
So  f (x, y) =  4
Comparing  this  with  (2),  we  get  g � (y) = 3y2 ,  so  g(y) = y3  + c. 
4 x3  + 4x2y + y3  + c. 
Plugging  into  above  formula  for  f ,  we  ﬁnally  get  f (x, y) =  3

Curl. 
Now  we  have:  Nx  =  My  ⇔ ∗  F� is  a  gradient  ﬁeld  ⇔  F� is  conservative:  C  F� · d�r  =  0  for  any 
closed  curve. 
⇒ 
only holds  if F� is deﬁned  everywhere,  or  in  a  “simply-connected”  region  –  see next week. 
(*): 
Failure  of  conservativeness  is  given  by  the  curl  of  F� : 
Deﬁnition:  curl( F� ) = Nx  − My . 
Interpretation  of  curl:  for  a  velocity  ﬁeld,  curl  =  (twice)  angular  velocity  of  the  rotation 
component  of  the  motion.

F� = �−y , x�  rotation  at  unit  angular  velocity  has  curl  =  2). 
For  a  force  ﬁeld,  curl F� =  torque  exerted  on  a  test mass, measures  how F� imparts  rotation motion.

This  is  equal  to  area  x¯ =  π  2 = 2π  (or  by  direct  computation  of  the  iterated  integral).  (Note: 
direct  calculation  of  the  line  integral  would  probably  involve  setting  x  =  2 + cos θ ,  y  =  sin θ ,  but 
then  calculations  get  really  complicated.) 
Application:  proof  of  our  criterion  for  gradient  ﬁelds.

PS8  Problem  2,  we  can’t  do  this  if  the  region  contains  the  origin  –  for  example,  the  line  integral 
along  the  unit  circle  is  non-zero  even  though  curl( F� )  is  zero  wherever  it’s  deﬁned.

Proof  of  Green’s  theorem.  2  preliminary  remarks:

2)  additivity:  if  theorem  is  true  for R1  and R2  then  it’s  true  for  the  union R = R1 ∪ R2  (picture

shown):  C  =  C1 
+  R2 
(the  line  integrals  along  inner portions  cancel  out)  and  R  =  R1

Finally  observe:  any  region  R  can  be  subdivided  into  vertically  simple  pieces  (picture  shown); 
My  dA,  so  by  additivity  C M dx = −  R My  dA. 
M dx = −  Ri 
for  each  piece  Ci 
Similarly  C  N dy  =  R Nx dA  by  subdividing  into  horizontally  simple  pieces.  This  completes

the  proof.

Example.  The area of a  region R  can be  evaluated using a  line  integral:  for  example, 
C 
1dA = area(R).
R 
This  idea was used  to build mechanical devices  that measure area of arbitrary  regions on a piece 
of  paper:  planimeters  (photo  of  the  actual  ob ject  shown,  and  principle  explained  brieﬂy:  as  one 
moves  its  arm  along  a  closed  curve,  the  planimeter  calculates  the  line  integral  of  a  suitable  vector 
ﬁeld  by  means  of  an  ingenious  mechanism;  at  the  end  of  the  motion,  one  reads  the  area).

Flux.  The ﬂux of a vector ﬁeld F� across a plane curve C  is  C  F� nˆ ds, where nˆ = normal vector 
� 
to  C ,  rotated  90◦  clockwise  from  Tˆ . 
� 
·
· 
We  now  have  two  types  of  line  integrals:  work,  F� Tˆ ds,  sums  F� Tˆ =  component  of  F� in
·

C ,  along  the  curve.

If  we  break  C  into  small  pieces  of  length Δs,  the  ﬂux  is 
Physical  interpretation:  if  F� is  a  velocity  ﬁeld  (e.g.  ﬂow  of  a  ﬂuid),  ﬂux measures  how much 
matter  passes  through  C  per  unit  time. 
Look  at  a  small  portion  of  C :  locally  F� is  constant,  what  passes  through  portion  of  C  in  unit 
time  is  contents  of  a  parallelogram  with  sides  Δs  and  F� (picture  shown  with  F� horizontal,  and 
·
· 
(picture  shown  rotated  with  portion  of  C �horizontal,  at  base  of  parallelogram).  Summing  these 
portion of curve = diagonal line segment).  The area of this parallelogram is Δs height = Δs (F� nˆ ).
· 
(F� nˆ ) ds  is  the  total  ﬂow  through  C  per  unit  time; 
contributions  along  all  of  C ,  we  get  that 
counting  positively what  ﬂows  towards  the  right  of C ,  negatively what  ﬂows  towards  the  left  of C , 
as  seen  from  the  point  of  view  of  a  point  travelling  along  C . 
F //nˆ ,  and  |F | = a,  so  F� · nˆ�

Example:  C  =  circle  of  radius  a  counterclockwise,  F� =  xˆı  + yˆj  (picture  shown):  along  C ,

a ds = a length(C ) = 2πa2 .
F� nˆ ds = 
C

Meanwhile,  the  ﬂux  of  −yˆı + xˆj  across  C  is  zero  (ﬁeld  tangent  to  C ). 
That  was  a  geometric  argument.  What  about  the  general  situation  when  calculation  of  the  line 
integral  is  required? 
Observe:  d�r = Tˆ ds = �dx, dy�,  and  nˆ is  Tˆ rotated  90◦  clockwise;  so  nˆ ds = �dy , −dx�. 
� 
� 
� 
So,  if  F� = P ˆı + Qˆj  (using  new  letters  to  make  things  look  diﬀerent;  of  course  we  could  call  the 
components M  and  N ),  then
�P , Q� · �dy , −dx� =

(or  if  F� = �M , N �,  C  −N dx + M dy). 
So we can compute ﬂux using the usual method, by expressing x, y , dx, dy  in terms of a parameter 
variable  and  substituting  (no  example  given).

Green’s  theorem  for  ﬂux.  If  C  encloses  R  counterclockwise,  and  F� = P ˆı + Qˆj ,  then

Physical  interpretation:  in  an  incompressible  ﬂuid  ﬂow,  divergence  measures  source/sink  den­
