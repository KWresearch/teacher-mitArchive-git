a)  Express  the  vectors  OQ  (a  diagonal  of  the  cube)  and  OR

(joining  O  to  the  center  of  a  face)  in  terms  of ˆı, ˆ k.
b)  Find  the  cosine  of  the  angle  between  OQ  and  OR.

c)  In  the  matrix  A,  replace  the  entry  2  in  the  upper-right  corner  by  c.  Find  a  value  of  c  for 
which  the  resulting matrix M  is  not  invertible. 
For  this  value  of  c  the  system  M X  =  0  has  other  solutions  than  the  obvious  one  X  =  0:  ﬁnd 
such  a  solution  by  using  vector  operations.  (Hint:  call  U ,  V  and  W  the  three  rows  of  M ,  and 
observe  that M X  = 0  if  and  only  if  X  is  orthogonal  to  the  vectors  U ,  V  and W .)

Problem  4.  (15  points) 

The  top  extremity  of  a  ladder  of  length  L  rests  against  a  vertical  wall,  while	
the  bottom  is  being  pulled  away.  Find  parametric  equations  for  the  midpoint

P  of  the  ladder,  using  as  parameter  the  angle  �  between  the  ladder  and  the

horizontal  ground.

a)  Find  the  area  of  the  space  triangle  with  vertices  P0  : (2, 1, 0),  P1  : (1, 0, 1),  P2  : (2, −1, 1).

b)  Find  the  equation  of  the  plane  containing  the  three  points  P0 ,  P1 ,  P2 .

c) Find the intersection of this plane with the line parallel to the vector V� = �1, 1, 1� and passing

through  the  point  S  : (−1, 0, 0).

c)  let A� be  the  acceleration:  still  assuming  that  R� has  constant  length,  and  using  vector  diﬀer­
entiation,  express  the  quantity  R� · A� in  terms  of  the  velocity  vector  only.
