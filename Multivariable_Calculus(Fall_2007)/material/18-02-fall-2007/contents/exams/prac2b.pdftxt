Problem  1.  Let  f (x, y) = x2y2  − x.

a)  (5)  Find �f  at  (2, 1)

b)  (5) Write  the  equation  for  the  tangent  plane  to  the  graph  of  f  at  (2, 1, 2).

c)  (5)  Use  a  linear  approximation  to  ﬁnd  the  approximate  value  of  f (1.9, 1.1).

d)  (5)  Find  the  directional  derivative  of  f  at  (2, 1)  in  the  direction  of  −ˆı + ˆ�.

Problem  2.  (10)  On  the  contour  plot  below,  mark  the  portion  of  the  level  curve  f  =  2000  on

� f 
which 
� 0. 
� y 

Problem  3.  a)  (10)  Find  the  critical  points  of 
w = −3x 2  − 4xy − y 2  − 12y + 16x

answer. 
Problem  4.  Let  u = y/x,  v = x2  + y2 ,  w = w(u, v).

b)  (7)  The  two  surfaces  in  part  (a)  intersect  in  a  curve  along  which  y  is  a  function  of  x.  Find 
dy/dx  at  (x, y , z ) = (1, 1, 1).
