Problem  1.  a) �f  = ⇒2xy 2  − 1, 2x2y� = ⇒3, 8� = 3ˆi − 8ˆj .

b)  z − 2 = 3(x − 2) + 8(y − 1)  or  z = 3x + 8y − 12.

c) �x = 1.9− 2 = −1/10 and �y = 1.1− 1 = 1/10.  So z √ 2+ 3�x+ 8�y = 2− 3/10+ 8/10 = 2.5

Problem  2. 

 

 

x = −20

y = 34


Problem  3.  a)	 wx  = −6x − 4y + 16 = 0  ∞ −3x − 2y + 8 = 0

wy  = −4x − 2y − 12 = 0  ∞  4x + 2y + 12 = 0 
Therefore  there  is  just  one  critical  point  at  (−20, 34).  Since 
wxxwyy  − wxy  = (−6) (−2) − (−4)2  = 12 − 16 = −4 < 0, 
2 
the  critical  point  is  a  saddle  point. 
b)  There  is  no  critical  point  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant,  hence  the maximum must  be  at  inﬁnity  or  on 
the  boundary  of  the  ﬁrst  quadrant. 
The  boundary  is  composed  of  two  half-lines: 
x = 0  and  y � 0  on  which  w = −y 2  − 12y .  It  has  a  maximum  (w = 0)  at  y = 0. 
• 
y  =  0  and  x �  0,  where  w  = −3x2  + 16x.  (The  graph  is  a  parabola  pointing  downwards). 
• 
Maximum:  wx  =  −6x + 16  = 0 
w = −3(8/3)2  + 16  8/3 = 64/3 > 0.∞  x 
= 8/3.  Hence  w  has  a  maximum  at  (8/3, 0)  and 
· 
We  now  check  that  the  maximum  of  w  is  not  at  inﬁnity: 
•  If  y � 0  and  x � +→  then  w � −3x2  + 16x,  which  tends  to  −→  as  x � +→. 
•  If  0 � x � C  and  y � +→,  then  w � −y 2  + 16C ,  which  tends  to  −→  as  y � +→. 
We  conclude  that  the  maximum  of  w  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant  is  at  (8/3, 0).

Problem  5.  a)  f (x, y , z ) = x;  the  constraint  is  g(x, y , z ) = x4 + y4 + z 4 + xy + yz + zx = 6.  The 
Lagrange multiplier  equation  is: 

�f  = ��g

b) The  level  surfaces  of  f  and  g  are  tangent  at  (x0 , y0 , z0 ),  so  they  have  the  same  tangent  plane. 
The  level  surface  of  f  is  the  plane  x = x0 ;  hence  this  is  also  the  tangent  plane  to  the  surface  g = 6 
at  (x0 , y0 , z0 ). 
Second  method:  at  (x0 , y0 , z0 ),  we  have

Problem  6. 
a) Taking  the  total diﬀerential of x2 + y3 − z 4  = 1, we get:  2x dx + 3y 2 dy − 4z 3 dz = 0.  Similarly, 
from  z 3  + zx + xy = 3,  we  get:  (y + z ) dx + x dy + (3z 2  + x) dz = 0. 
b)  At  (1, 1, 1)  we  have:  2 dx + 3 dy − 4 dz  = 0  and  2 dx + dy + 4 dz  =  0.  We  eliminate  dz  (by 
adding  these  two  equations):  4 dx + 4 dy = 0,  so  dy = −dx,  and  hence  dy/dx = −1.
