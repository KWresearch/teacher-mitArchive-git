Problem  1.  (15) 
a)  Show  that  the  vector  ﬁeld 
F = �e  yz , e  z + 2yz , e  y + y 2  + 1�

is  conservative. 
b)  By  a  systematic  method,  ﬁnd  a  potential  for  F. 
c)  Show  that  the  vector  ﬁeld G = �y , x, y�  is  not  conservative. 
Problem  2.  (20)  Let  S  be  the  part  of  the  spherical  surface  x2  + y2  +  z 2  =  4,  lying  in 
x2  + y2  > 1,  which  is  to  say  outside  the  cylinder  of  radius  one  with  axis  the  z -axis.

a)  Compute  the  ﬂux  outward  through  S  of  the  vector  ﬁeld  F = y i − xj + zk.

b)  Show  that  the  ﬂux  of  this  vector  ﬁeld  through  any  part  of  the  cylindrical  surface  is  zero.

c) Using  the  divergence  theorem  applied  to F,  compute  the  volume  of  the  region  between  S

and  the  cylinder.

Problem  3.  (20)  Let  S  be  the  part  of  the  spherical  surface  x2 + y2 + z 2  = 2  lying  in  z > 1.

Orient S  upwards and give  its bounding  circle, C ,  lying  in  z = 1  the  compatible orientation.

a)  Parametrize  C  and  use  the  parametrization  to  evaluate  the  line  integral

�
b)  Compute  the  curl  of  the  vector  ﬁeld  F = xz i + yj + yk.

c) Write  down  a  ﬂux  integral  through  S  which  can  be  computed  using  the  value  of  I .

Problem  4.  (15) Use  the divergence  theorem  to compute  the ﬂux of F = i + j + k outwards

across  the  closed  surface  x4  + y4  + z 4  = 1.

Problem  5.  (15)  Consider  the  surface  S  given  by  the  equation

z = (x 2  + y 2  + z 2 )2 . 
a)  Show  that  S  lies  in  the  upper  half  space  (z � 0). 
b) Write  out  the  equation  for  the  surface  in  spherical  polar  coordinates. 
c)  Using  the  equation  obtained  in  part  b),  give  an  iterated  integral,  with  explicit  integrand 
and  limits  of  integration,  which  gives  the  volume  of  the  region  inside  this  surface.  Do  not

evaluate  the  integral.

Problem  6.  (15)  Let  S  be  the  part  of  the  surface  z  =  xy  where  x2  + y2  <  1.  Compute

the  ﬂux  of  F  =  y i + xj + zk  upward  across  S  by  reducing  the  surface  integral  to  a  double

integral  over  the  disk  x2  + y2  < 1.
