18.02  Practice  Exam  2 A  –  Solutions 

Problem  1. 
a)  ∇f  = (y − 4x3 ) ˆı + x ˆ;  at  P ,  ∇f  =  h−3, 1i. 
b)  ∆w  ≃ −3 ∆x  + ∆y . 

Problem  2. 

a)  By  measuring,  ∆h  = 100 for ∆s  ≃  500,  so

b)  Q is the northernmost point  on the curve  h  = 2200;  the vertical distance between consecutive

level  curves   is  about  1/3  of  the  given  length  unit,  so

Problem  3. 
f (x, y , z ) =  x3y +  z 2  =  3  :  the  normal  vector   is  ∇f  =  h3x2y , x3 , 2z i  =  h3, −1, 4i.  The  tangent 
plane is 3x  − y + 4z  = 4. 

Problem  4. 
a) The volume is  xyz  =  xy(1− x2 − y2 ) =  xy − x3y − xy3 . Critical points:  fx  =  y − 3x2y − y3  = 0, 
fy  =  x  − x3  − 3xy2  = 0. 
b) Assuming x >  0 and  y >  0, the equations can be rewritten as 1−3x2 −y2  = 0, 1−x2 −3y2  = 0. 
Solution:  x2  =  y2  = 1/4, i.e. (x, y) = (1/2, 1/2). 
2 − 3y
c)  fxx  =  −6xy  =  −3/2,   fyy  =  −6xy  =  −3/2,  fxy  = 1 − 3x
and   fxx  <  0,  it  is  a  local  maximum. 
d)  The  maximum  of  f  lies  either  at (1/2, 1/2),  or   on  the  boundary  of   the  domain  or   at  inﬁnity. 
Since  f (x, y) =  xy(1 − x2 − y2 ), f  = 0  when  either  x  →  0  or   y  →  0,  and  f  → −∞  when  x  → ∞  or 
1 ,  2
1 ),  where f ( 2
1 ,  2
1 ) =  8
1 . 
y  → ∞  (since x2  +  y2  → ∞).  So the  maximum is  at (x, y) = ( 2

2  =  −1/2.  So  fxxfyy 

− f 2 
xy  >  0, 

Problem  5. 
a)  f (x, y , z ) =  xyz ,  g(x, y , z ) =  x2  +  y2  +  z  =  1  :  one  must  solve  the  Lagrange  multiplier  
equation   ∇f  =  λ∇g , i.e.  yz  = 2λx,  xz  = 2λy ,  xy  =  λ,  and  the  constraint  equation  x2 + y2 + z  = 1. 
b)  Dividing  the  ﬁrst  two  equations  yz  = 2λx  and  xz   = 2λy  by  each  other,  we  get  y/x   =  x/y , 
so   x2  =  y2 ;  since  x >  0  and  y >  0  we  get  y  =  x.  Substituting  this  into  the  Lagrange  multiplier  
equations, we get  z  = 2λ  and  x2  =  λ. Hence  z  = 2x2 , and  the constraint  equation becomes 4x2  = 1,
