Problem  1.  a)  Draw  a  picture  of  the  region  of  integration  of 

  1 �

x 
0 
b)  Exchange  the  order  of  integration  to  express  the  integral  in  part  (a)  in  terms  of  integration 
in  the  order  dxdy .  Warning:  your  answer  will  have  two  pieces. 

dydx. 

  2x 

Problem  2.  a)  Find  the mass M  of  the  upper  half  of  the  annulus  1 < x2 + y2  < 9 (y � 0) with 
y
density  � =

x2  + y2 
b)  Express  the  x-coordinate  of  the  center  of  mass,  x¯,  as  an  iterated  integral.  (Write  explicitly 
the  integrand  and  limits  of  integration.)  Without  evaluating  the  integral,  explain  why  ¯x = 0. 

Problem  3.  a)  Show  that  F = (3x2  − 6y2 )ˆı + (−12xy + 4y)ˆ�  is  conservative. 
b)  Find  a  potential  function  for  F. 

c)  Let  C  be  the  curve  x = 1 + y 3 (1 − y)3 , 0 � y � 1.  Calculate

(Do  not  evaluate  the  integral;  don’t  even  simplify  f (t).) 
b)  Evaluate  the  line  integral  using  Green’s  theorem. 

Problem  5.  Consider the rectangle R with vertices (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 4) and (0, 4).  The boundary 
of R  is  the  curve  C ,  consisting  of  C1 ,  the  segment  from  (0, 0)  to  (1, 0),  C2 ,  the  segment  from  (1, 0) 
to  (1, 4), C3  the  segment  from  (1, 4)  to  (0, 4) and C4  the  segment  from  (0, 4)  to  (0, 0).  Consider  the 
vector  ﬁeld 

F = (xy + sin x cos y)ˆı − (cos x sin y)ˆ�

a)  Find  the  ﬂux  of  F  out  of  R  through  C .  Show  your  reasoning.

b)  Is  the  total  ﬂux  out  of  R  through  C1 ,  C2  and  C3 ,  more  than,  less  than  or  equal  to  the  ﬂux 
out  of  R  through  C ?  Show  your  reasoning. 

Problem  6.  Find  the  volume  of  the  region  enclosed  by  the  plane  z = 4  and  the  surface 
z = (2x − y)2  + (x + y − 1)2 . 

(Suggestion:  change  of  variables.)
