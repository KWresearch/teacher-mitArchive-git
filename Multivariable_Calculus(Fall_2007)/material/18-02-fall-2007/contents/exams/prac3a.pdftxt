18.02  Practice  Exam  3 A


1.  Let ( ¯x,  y¯)  be  the  center  of  mass  of   the  triangle  with   vertices  at  (−2, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0)   and 
uniform density  δ  = 1. 

a) (10)  Write an integral formula for   ¯y .  Do  not  evaluate  the  integral(s),  but  write  explicitly  the 
integrand  and  limits  of  integration. 

b) (5)  Find  x¯. 

2.  (15)  Find  the  polar  moment  of  inertia  of   the  unit  disk  with   density  equal  to  the  distance 
from the  y -axis. 

3.  Let  F~ = (ax y + y3 + 1)ˆı + (2x + bxy2 + 2)ˆ  be  a  vector   ﬁeld,  where  a  and  b  are  constants.

a) (5)  Find the  values  of  a  and  b  for   which  F~ is  conservative.

b) (5)  For these  values  of  a  and  b,  ﬁnd  f (x, y) such  that  F~ =  ∇f .

c) (5)  Still  using  the  values  of  a  and  b  from part (a),  compute  � F~ ·  d~r  along   the  curve  C  such 
C 
that  x  =  et cos t,  y  =  et sin t, 0  ≤  t  ≤  π . 
4.  (10) For  F~ =  yx3ˆı + y2ˆ,  ﬁnd  �C  F~ ·  d~r  on the portion of   the curve  y  =  x2  from (0, 0)  to (1, 1). 
5.  Consider the region  R  in the  ﬁrst quadrant bounded by  the curves  y  =  x2 ,  y  =  x2/5,  xy  = 2, 
and  xy  = 4. 

a) (10)  Compute  dxdy  in  terms   of  dudv   if  u  =  x2/y  and  v  =  xy .


b) (10)  Find  a double integral for the  area   of   R  in  uv  coordinates  and  evaluate  it.


6.  a)  (5)  Let  C  be  a  simple  closed   curve  going   counterclockwise  around  a  region  R.  Let 
�
M  =  M (x, y).  Express   M dx  as  a  double  integral  over  R.

7.  Consider  the  region  R  enclosed by  the  x-axis,  x  = 1  and  y  =  x3 . 
a) (5)  Use the normal form of Green’s theorem to  ﬁnd  the  ﬂux of   F~ = (1 + y2 )ˆ  out  of   R. 

b) (5)  Find the  ﬂux out of  R  through   the  two  sides  C1  (the  horizontal  segment)  and  C2  (the 
vertical   segment). 

c) (5)  Use parts (a)  and (b)  to  ﬁnd  the  ﬂux out of the third  side  C3 .
