Problem  1.  (10  points:  5,  5)

Let  f (x, y) =  xy − x4 .

a)  Find  the  gradient  of  f  at  P  : (1, 1).


b)  Give  an  approximate  formula  telling  how  small  changes  Δx  and Δy  produce  a  small  change

Δw  in  the  value  of  w =  f (x, y) at the point (x, y) = (1, 1). 

Problem  2.  (20 points) 

On the topographical  map  below, the level  curves for the height function  h(x, y) are marked (in 
feet);  adjacent  level  curves  represent  a  diﬀerence  of   100  feet  in  height.  A  scale  is  given.

a)  Estimate   to  the  nearest  .1  the  value  at  the  point  P  of the directional derivative 

,  where 

 

uˆ is the  unit  vector in the direction  of ˆı + ˆ.

Problem  3.  (10 points) 
Find  the  equation   of  the  tangent  plane  to  the  surface  x3y +  z 2  = 3  at the point (−1, 1, 2). 

Problem  4.  (20  points:  5,5,5,5) 

A  rectangular  box  is  placed  in  the  ﬁrst  octant  as  shown,  with  one  corner  at  the  origin  and  the 
three  adjacent  faces  in  the  coordinate  planes.  The  opposite  point  P  : (x, y , z ) is  constrained  to  lie

on the paraboloid   x

 +  z =
 1.  Which  P  gives  the  box  of   greatest  volume?

a)  Show that the problem leads  one to  maximize  f (x, y) =  xy − x3y − xy3 ,  and

write   down  the  equations  for  the  critical  points  of   f .

b)  Find   a  critical   point  of  f  which lies in the  ﬁrst quadrant (x > 0,  y > 0).

c)  Determine  the  nature  of  this  critical  point  by  using   the  second  derivative  test.

Problem  5.  (15 points) 

In  Problem  4  above,  instead  of  substituting   for  z ,  one  could   also   use  Lagrange  multipliers  to 
maximize  the  volume  V  =  xyz  with  the  same  constraint  x2  +  y2  +  z = 1. 

a)  Write  down  the  Lagrange  multiplier  equations  for  this  problem. 

b)  Solve the  equations (still  assuming  x > 0,  y > 0). 

Problem  6.  (10 points) 

Let  w =  f (u, v),  where u =  xy  and  v =  x/y .  Using   the  chain  rule,  express 

∂w 
∂x 

and 

∂w 
∂ y 

in  terms  of 

x,  y ,  fu  and  fv . 

Problem  7.  (15 points) 

Suppose that  x2y + xz 2  = 5, and let  w =  x3y . Express 

it  numerically   when (x, y , z ) = (1, 1, 2).
