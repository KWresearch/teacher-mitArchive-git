18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 18 

This week's problem set is kind of  long. It's longer than the last one, certainly. So, if 
you haven't started yet, then now would be a good time to start. OK, so far we've 
learned how to do double integrals in terms of xy coord inates, also how to sw itch to 
polar coord inates. But, more generally, there's a lot of different changes of variables 
that you might want to do. OK, so today we're going to see how to change variables, 
if you want, how to do substitutions in doub le  integrals. OK, so let me start w ith a 
simple example. 

Let's say that we want to find the area of an ellipse w ith semi-axes a and b. OK, so 
that means an ellipse is just like a squished circle. And so, there's a and there's b. 
And, the equation of that ellipse is x over a squared p lus y over b squared equals 
one. That's the curve, and the inside region is where this is less than one. OK, so it's 
just like a circle that where you have resca led x and y d ifferently. So, let's say we 
want to  find the area of it. Maybe you know what the area is. But let's do it as a 
double integra l. 

So, you know, if you find that the area is too easy, you can integrate any function 
other than ellipse, if you prefer. But, let's do it just w ith area. So, we know that we 
want to integrate just the area element, let's say, dx dy over the origin inside the 
ellipse. That's x over a2 plus y over b2 less than 1. Now, we can try to set this up in 
terms of x and y coordinates, you know, set up the bounds by solving for first four x 
as a  function of y  if we do it this order and, well, do the usua l stuff. That doesn't look 
very pleasant, and it's certa inly not the best way to do it. OK, if this were a circle, we 
would switch to polar coordinates. Well, we can't quite do that yet. But, you know, 
an ellipse is just a squished circle. So, maybe we want to actually first rescale x and 
y by a and b. 

So, to do that, what we'd like to do is set x over a to be u, and y over b be v. So, 
we'll have two new variab les, u and v, and we'll try to redo our integra l in terms of u 
and v. So, how do we do the substitution? So, in terms of u and v, the cond ition, the 
region that we are integrating on will become u^2 v^2  is less than 1, which is 
arguab ly nicer than the ellipse. That's why we are doing  it. But, we need to know 
what to do with dx and dy. Well, here, the answer is pretty easy because we just 
change x and y separately. We do two independent substitutions. OK, so if we set u 
equa ls x over a, that means du  is one over adx. 

And here, dv is one over bdy. So, it's very tempting to write, and here we actually 
can write,  in this particular case, that dudv  is (1/ab)dxdy, OK? So, let me rewrite 
that. OK, so I get dudv equals (1/ab)dxdy, or equiva lently dxdy  is ab times dudv. 
OK, so  in my double integral, I'm going to write (ab)dudv. OK, so now, my double 
integral becomes, well, the double integral of a constant in terms of u and v. So, I 
can take the constant out. I will get ab times double integral over u^2 v^2<1 of du 
dv. And, that is an integra l that we know how to do. Well, it's just the area of a unit 
circle. 

So, we can just say, this  is ab times the area of the unit d isk, which we know to be 
pi, or if somehow you had some function to integrate, then you could have somehow 
switched to polar coordinates, you know, setting u equals r times cos(theta), v 
equa ls r times sin(theta), and then doing it in polar coord inates. OK, so here the 
substitution worked pretty easy. The question is, if we do a change of variables 
where the relation between x and y and u and v is more complicated, what can we 
do? Can we still do this, or do we have to be more careful? And, actua lly, we have to 
be more careful. So, that's what we are going to see next. Any question about this, 
first? 

No? OK. OK, so, see the general problem when we try to do this is to  figure out what 
is the sca le factor? What's the relation between dxdy and dudv? We need to find the 
sca ling factor. So, we need to  find dxdy versus dudv. So, let's do another example 
that's still pretty easy, but a little b it less easy. OK, so  let's say that for some reason, 
we want to do the change of variables: u equals 3x-2y, and v equa ls x y. Why would 
we want to do that? Well, that might be to simp lify the integrand because we are 
integrating a function that happens to be actua lly involving these guys rather than x 
and y. 

Or, it might be to simplify the bounds because maybe we are integrating over a 
region whose equation in xy coordinates is very hard to write down. But, it becomes 
much easier in terms of u and v. And then, the bounds would be much easier to set 
up with u and v. Anyway, so, whatever the reason might be, typ ica lly it would be to 
simplify the integrant or the bounds. Well, how do we convert dxdy to dudv? So, we 
want to understand, what's the relation between, let's call dA the area element in xy 
coordinates. So, dA is dxdy, maybe dydx depending on the order. And, the area 
element in uv coordinates, let me call that dA prime just to make it look different. 

So, that would just be dudv, or dvdu depending on which order I w ill want to set it 
up in. So,  to find this relation, it's probably best to draw a picture to see what 
happens. Let's consider a small piece of the xy p lane w ith area delta(A) 
corresponding to just a box w ith sides delta(y) and delta(x). OK, and let's try to 
figure out what it w ill look like in terms of u and v. And then, we'll say, well, when 
we integrate, we're rea lly summing the value of the function of a lot of sma ll boxes 
times their area. 

But,  the prob lem is that the area of the box in here is not the same as the area of 
the box in uv coordinates. There, maybe it will look like, actually, if you see that 
these are linear changes of variables, you know that the rectang le w ill become a 
parallelogram after the change of variables. So, the area of a parallelogram delta(A) 
prime, well, we will have to figure out how they are related so that we can decide 
what conversion factor, what's the exchange rate between these two currencies for 
area? 

OK, any questions at this point? No? Still with me mostly? I see a lot of tired  faces. 
Yes? Why is delta(A) prime a para llelogram? That's a very good question. Well, see, 
if I look at the side of a rectang le, say there's a vertical side, it means I'm going to 
increase y, keeping x the same. If I look at the formulas for u and v, they are linear 
formulas in terms of x and y. So, if I just increase y, see that u is going to decrease 
at a  rate of two. v is going to increase at a rate of one at constant rates. And, it 
doesn't matter whether I was looking at this site or at that site. So, basically straight 
lines become straight lines. And if they are parallel, they stay parallel. 

So, if you just look at what the transformation, from xy to uv does, it does this kind 
of thing. Actually, this transformation here you can express by a matrix. And, 
remember, we've seen what matrices do the pictures. We just take stra ight lines to 
straight lines. They keep the notion of being parallel, but of course they mess up 
lengths, ang les, and all that. OK, so let's see. So, let's try to  figure out, what is the 
area of this guy? 

Well, in  fact, what I've been saying about this transformation being linear, and 
transforming all of the vertica l lines in the same way, all the horizonta l lines in the 
same way, it tells me, a lso, I should have a constant scaling factor, right, because 
how much I've sca led my rectangle doesn't depend on where my rectangle is. If I 
move my rectangle to somewhere else, I have a rectangle of the same size, same 
shape, it w ill become a para llelogram of the same size, same shape somewhere else. 

So, in  fact, I can just take the simp lest rectangle I can think of and see how its area 
changes. And, if you don't believe me, then try with any other rectangle. You will see 
it works exactly the same way. OK, so I claim that the area scaling  factor -- -- here 
in this case doesn't depend on the choice of the rectangle. And I should say that 
because we are actua lly doing a linear change of variables --

So, you know, somehow, the exchange rate between uv and xy is going to be the 
same everywhere. So, let's try to see what happens to the simplest rectangle I can 
think of, namely, just the unit square. And, you know, if you don't trust me, then 
while I'm doing this one, do it with a d ifferent rectangle. Do the same ca lculation, 
and see that you will get the same conversion ratio. So, let's say that I take a unit 
square --

-- so, something that goes from zero to one both in x and y directions. OK, and let's 
try to figure out what it looks like on the other side. So, here the area is one. Let's 
try to draw it in terms of u and v coordinates, OK? So, here we have x equals 0, y 
equa ls 0. Well, that tells us u and v are going to be 0. Next, let's look at this corner. 
Well, in xy coord inates, this is one zero. If you p lug x equals 1, y equa ls 0, you get u 
equa ls 3; v equa ls 1. So, that goes somewhere here. And so, this edge of the square 
will become this line here, OK? 

Next, let's look at that point. So that point here was (0,1). If I p lug x equals zero y 
equa ls one I w ill get (-2,1). So, this edge goes here. Then, if you put x equals one, y 
equa ls one, you w ill get u equa ls 1, v equals 2. So, I want (1,2). And, these edges 
will go to these edges here. And, you see, it does look like a para llelogram. OK, so 
now what the area of this para llelogram? Well, we can get that by taking the 
determinant of these two vectors. So, one of them is <3,1>, and the other one is <-
2,1>. That w ill be 3 2. That's 5. OK, this para llelogram is apparently five times the 
size of this square. Here, it  looks  like  it's less because I somehow changed my sca le. 
I mean, my unit length is smaller here than here. 

But,  it should be a lot b igger than that. OK, and  if you do the same ca lculations not 
with zero and one, but w ith x and x plus delta x, and so on, you will still find that the 
area has been multiplied by five. So, that tells us, actually for any other rectangle, 
area is a lso multip lied by five. So, that tells us that dA prime, the area element in uv 
coordinate is worth  five times more than the area element in the xy coord inate. 

So, that means du dv is worth  five times dx dy. What's so funny? What? Oh. 
[LAUGHTER] OK, rectangle. OK, is that OK now? Did I misspell other words? No? OK, 

it's really hard to see when you are up close. It's much easier from a distance. OK, 
so yeah, so we've said our transformation multiplies areas by five. And so, dudv is 
five times dxdy. So, if I'm integrating some function, dx dy, then when I switch to uv 
coordinates, I will have to rep lace that by one fifth dudv. OK, and of course I would 
also, here my function would probably involve x and y. I will rep lace them by u's and 
v's. And, the bounds, well, the shape of my origin in the xy coordinates I w ill have to 
switch to some shape in the uv coordinates. 

And, that's a lso something that might be easy or might be tricky depend ing on what 
orig in we are looking at. So, usually we will do changes of variab les to actually 
simplify the reg ion so it becomes easier to set up the bounds. So, anyway, so this is 
kind of an illustration of a genera l case. And, why is that? Well, here it looks very 
easy. We are just using linear formulas, and somehow the relation between dx dy 
and du dv is the same everywhere. If you take actually more comp licated changes of 
variables that's not true because usua lly you will expect that there are some places 
where the rescaling is enlarging things, and some of other p laces where things are 
shrunk, so, certainly the exchange rate between dudv and dxdy w ill fluctuate from 
point to point. It's the same as if you're trying to change dollars to euros. 

It depends on where you do it. You w ill get a better rate or a worse one. So, of 
course, we'll get a formula where actua lly this scaling factor depends on x and y or 
on u and v. But, if you fix a point, then we have linear approximation. And, linear 
approximation tells us, oh, we can do as  if our function is just a linear function of x 
and y. So then, we can do it the same way we d id here. OK, so let's try to think 
about that. 

So, in the general case, well, that means we w ill rep lace x and y by new coordinates, 
u and v. And, u and v w ill be some functions of x and y. So, well, we'll have an 
approximation formula which tells us that the change in u, if I change x or y a little 
bit, will be roughly (u sub x times change in x) (u sub y times change in y). And, the 
change in v will be roughly (v sub x delta x) (v sub y delta y). Or, the other way to 
say it, if you want in matrix form is delta u delta v is, sorry, approximately equal to 
matrix |u sub x, u sub y, v sub x, v sub y| times matrix |delta x, delta y|, OK? 

So, if we look at that, what it tells us, in  fact, is that if we take a small rectang le  in 
xy coordinates, so that means we have a certain point, x, y, and then we have a 
certain w idth. This is going to be too sma ll. Well, so, I have my w idth, delta x. I have 
my height, delta y. This is going to correspond to a small uv parallelogram. And, 
what the shape and the size of the parallelogram are depends on the partial 
derivatives of u and v. So, in particular, it depends on at which point we are. But 
still, at a given point,  it's a b it like that. And, so  if we do the same argument as 
before, what we w ill see is that the scaling factor is actually the determinant of this 
transformation. 

So, that's one thing that maybe we didn't emphasize enough when we d id matrices 
at the beginning of a semester. But, when you have a linear transformation between 
variables, the determinant of that transformation represents how it sca les areas. OK, 
so one way to think about  it is just to try it and see what happens. Take this side. 
This side in x, y coordinates corresponds to delta x and zero. And, now, if you take 
the image of that, if you see what happens to delta u and delta v, that will be 
basically u sub x delta x and v sub x delta x. There's no delta y. For the other side, 
OK, so maybe I should do it actually. So, you know, if we move in the x, y 

coordinates by delta x and zero, then delta u and delta v w ill be approximately u sub 
x delta x, and v sub x delta x. 

And, on the other hand, if you move in the other d irection a long the other side of 
your rectangle, zero and delta y, then the change in u and the change in v will 
correspond to, well, how does u change? That's u sub y delta y, and v changes by v 
sub y delta y. And so, now, if you take the determinant of these two vectors, OK, so 
these are the sides of your parallelogram up here. And, if you take these sides to get 
the area of the para llelogram, you'll need to take the determinant. And, the 
determinant will be the determinant of this matrix times delta x times delta y. 

So, the area  in uv coord inates will be the determinant of a matrix times delta x, delta 
y. And so, what I'm  trying to say is that when you have a genera l change of 
variables, du dv versus dx dy is given by the determinant of this matrix of partia l 
derivatives. It doesn't matter in which order you write it. I mean, you can put in 
rows or columns. If you transpose a matrix, that doesn't change the determinant. 
It's just any sensible matrix that you can write will have the correct determinant. 

OK, so what we need to know is the follow ing thing. So, we define something called 
the Jacob ian of a change of variab les and used the letter J, or maybe a more useful 
notation is partial of u, v over partial of x, y. That's a very strange notation. I mean, 
that doesn't mean that we are actually taking the partia l derivatives of anything. OK, 
it's just a notation to remind us that this has to do with the ratio between dudv and 
dxdy. 

And, it's obtained using the partia l derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y. So, 
it's the determinant of the matrix |u sub x, u sub y, v sub x, v sub y|, the matrix 
that I had up there. OK, and what we need to know is that du dv is equa l to the 
absolute va lue of J dx dy. Or, if you prefer to see it in the easier to remember 
version, it's (absolute va lue of d of (u, v) over partial xy) times dx dy. OK, so this is 
just what you need to remember, and it says that the area in uv coordinates  is 
worth, well, the ratio  to the xy coordinates  is given by this Jacobian determinant 
except for one small thing. 

It's g iven by, actua lly, the absolute va lue of this guy. OK, so what's going on here? 
What's going on here is when we are saying the determinant of the transformation 
tells us how the area  is multiplied, there's a sma ll catch. Remember, the 
determinants are equal to areas up to sine. Sometimes, the determinant is negative 
because of reversing the orientation of things. But, the area  is still the same. Area is 
always positive. So, the area elements are actua lly related by the absolute value of 
this guy. OK, so if you  find -10 as your answer, then du dv is still ten times dx dy. 

OK, so I d idn't put it a ll together because then you would have two sets of vertical 
bars. See, this is a vertical bar for absolute va lue. This is vertical bar for 
determinant. They're not the same. That's the one thing to remember. OK, any 
questions about this? No? OK. So, actually let's do our first example of that. Let's 
check what we had  for polar coord inates. Last time I told you if we have dx dy we 
could sw itch it to r dr d theta. And, we had some argument for that by looking at the 
area of a small circular sector. But, let's check again using this new method. So,  in 
polar coord inates I'm setting x equals r cosine theta, y equals r sine theta. 

So, the Jacobian for this change of variab les, so  let's say I'm  trying to find the partial 
derivatives of x, y with respect to r, theta. Well, what is, OK, let me actua lly write 

them here aga in for you. And, so what does that become? Partial x over partia l r is 
just cosine theta. Partial x over partia l theta is negative r sine theta. Sorry, I guess 
I'm going to run out of space here. So, let me do it underneath. So, we sa id x sub r 
is cosine theta; x sub theta is negative r sine theta. 

y sub  r is sine; y sub theta is r cosine. And now, if we compute this determinant, 
we'll get (r cosine squared theta) (r sine squared theta). And, that simp lifies to r. So, 
dx dy is, well, absolute va lue of r dr d theta. But, remember that r is always positive. 
So, it's r dr d theta. OK, so that's another way to justify how we did double integra ls 
in polar coordinates. OK, any questions on that? Where? Yeah, OK. 

Yeah, so this one seems to be switching. Well, it depends what you do. So, OK, 
actually here's an important thing that I didn't quite say. So, I sa id, you know, we 
are going to switch from xy to uv. We can also switch from uv to xy. And, this 
conversion ratio, the Jacobian, works both ways. Once you have found the ratio 
between du dv and dx dy, then it works one way or it works the other way. I mean, 
here, of course, we get the answer in terms of r. So, this would let us switch  from xy 
to r theta. But, we can also switch from r theta to xy. Just, we'd write dr d theta 
equa ls (1 over r) times dx dy. And then we'd have, of course, to rep lace r by its 
formula in xy coord inates. 

Usually, we don't do that. Usually, we actua lly start with xy and switch to polar. But, 
so in general, when you have this formula  relating du dv w ith dx dy, you can use it 
both ways, either to sw itch  from du dv to dx dy or the other way around. And, the 
thing that I'm not telling you that now I should probably tell you is I could define two 
Jacobians because  if I solve for xy in terms of uv instead of uv in terms of xy, then I 
can compute two different Jacob ians. 

I can compute partia l uv over partial xy, or I can compute partia l xy over partia l uv if 
I have the formulas both ways. Well, the good news is these guys are the inverse of 
each other. So, the two formulas that you might get are consistent. OK, so useful 
remark -- So, say that you can compute both -- -- these guys. Well, then actually, 
the product w ill just be 1. So,  they are the inverse of each other. So, it doesn't 
matter which one you compute. You can compute whichever one is the easiest to 
compute no matter which one of the two you need. 

And, one way to see that is that,  in fact, we're looking at the determinant of these 
matrices that tell us the relation in variab les. So, if one of them tells you how delta u 
delta v relate to delta x delta y, the other one does the opposite thing. It means they 
are the inverse matrices. And, the determinant of the inverse matrix is the inverse of 
the determinant. So, they are rea lly interchangeable. I mean, you can just compute 
whichever one is easiest. So here, if you wanted, dr d theta in terms of dx dy, it's 
easier to do this and then move the r over there than to first solve for r and theta as 
functions of x and y and then do the entire thing again. But, you can do it if you 
want. I mean, it works. 

Oh yeah, the other useful remark, so, I mentioned it, but let me emphasize again. 
So, now,  the ratio between du dv and dx dy, it's not a constant anymore, a lthough 
there it used to be five. But now, it's become r, or anything. In genera l, it w ill be a 
function that depends on the variables. So, it's not true that you can just say, oh, I'll 
put a constant times du dv. Yes? It would still work the same. You could imagine 
drawing a picture where r and theta are the Cartesian coordinates, and your p icture 
would be completely messed up. It would be a very strange thing to do to try to 

draw, you know, I'm going to do it, but don't take notes on that. You could try to 
draw p icture like that, and then a circle would start looking like, you know, a disk 
would look  like that. It would be very counterintuitive. But, you could do it. And that 
would be equiva lent to what we did with a previous change of variab les. 

So, in this case, certa inly you would never draw a picture like that. But, you could do 
it. OK, so now  let's do a comp lete examp le to see how things fit together, how we do 
everything. So, let's say that we want to compute, so I have to warn you, it's going 
to be a very silly examp le. It's an example where it's much easier to compute things 
without the change of variables. But, you know,  it's good practice in the sense that 
we're going to make it so complicated that if we can do this one,  then we can do that 
one. So, let's say that we want to compute this. And, of course, it's very easy to 
compute it d irectly. 

But let's say that for some evil reason we want to do that by chang ing variables to u 
equa ls x and v equals xy. OK, that's a very strange idea, but let's do it anyway. I 
mean, norma lly, you would only do this kind of substitution if either it simplifies a lot 
the function you are integrating, or it simp lifies a lot the reg ion on which you are 
integrating. And here, neither happens. But anyway, so the first thing we have to do 
here is figure out what we are going to be integrating. OK, so to do that, we should 
figure out what dx dy w ill become in terms of u and v. So, that's what we've just 
seen using the Jacobian. OK, so the first thing to do is find the area element. And, 
for that, we use the Jacobian. So, well, let's see, the one that we can do easily is 
partials of u and v w ith respect to x and y. 

I mean, the other one is not very hard because here you can solve easily. But, the 
one that's given to you is partia l of u and v w ith respect to x and y, so partia l u 
partial x is one. Partial u partial y is zero. Partia l v partial x is y. And partia l v partia l 
y is x. So that's just x. So, that means that du dv is x dx dy. Well, it would be 
absolute va lue of x, but x is positive in our orig in. So, at least we don't have to worry 
about that. 

OK, so now that we have that, we can try to look at the integrand in terms of u and 
v. OK, so we were integrating x squared y dx dy. So, let's sw itch it. Well, let's first 
switch the dx dy that becomes one over x du dv. So, that's actually xy du dv. And, 
what is xy in terms of u and v? Well, here at least we had a little bit of luck. xy is 
just v. So, that's v du dv. So, in  fact, what we'll be computing is a doub le integral 
over some mysterious region of v du dv. 

Now, last but not least, we'll have to find what are the bounds for u and v in the new 
integral so that we know how to eva luate this. In fact, well, we could do it du dv or 
dv du. We don't know yet. Oh, amazing. It went all the way down this time. OK, so it 
could be dv du if that's easier. So, let's try to find the bounds. In this case, that's the 
hardest part. OK, so let me draw a p icture in xy coordinates and try to understand 
things using that. OK, so x and y go  from zero to one. The reg ion that we want to 
integrate over was just this square. 

Let's try to figure out how u and v vary there. So, let's say that we're going to do it 
du dv. OK, so What we want to understand is how u and v vary in here. What's going 
to happen? So, the way we can think about it is we try to figure out how we are 
slicing our orig in. OK, so here, we are integrating first over u. That means we start 
by keeping u constant, no, by keeping v constant as u changes. OK, so u changes as 

v is constant. What does it mean that I'm keeping v constant. Well, what is v? v is 
xy. 

So, that means I keep xy equals constant. What does the curve xy equa ls constant 
look like? Well, it's just a hyperbola. y equals constant over x. So,  if I look at the 
various values of v that I can take,  for each va lue of v, if I fix a va lue of v, I will be 
moving on one of these red curves. OK, and u, well, u is the same thing as x. So, 
that means u will increase. Here, maybe it w ill be 0.1 and it will increase all the way 
to one here. OK, so we are just traveling on each of these slices. Now, so the 
question we must answer here is for a given va lue of v, what are the bounds for u? 
So, I'm traveling on my curve, v equals constant, and trying to figure out, when do I 
enter my orig in? When do I leave  it? 

Well, I enter it when I go through this side. So,  the question is, what's the value of u 
here? Well, we don't know that very easily until we look at these formulas. So, u 
equa ls x, OK, but we don't know what x is at that point. v equals x and v equa ls xy. 
What do we go here? Well, we don't know x, but we know y certa inly. OK, so let's 
forget about trying to find u. And, let's say,  for now, we know y equals one. Well, if 
we set y equals one, that tells us that u and v are both equa l to x. So, in terms of u 
and v, the equation of this uv coordinate is u equals v. 

OK, I mean, the other way to do it is, say that you know you want y equa ls one. You 
want to know what is y in terms of u and v. Well, it's easy. y is v over u. So, let me 
actually add an extra step in case that's, so, we know that y is v over u equals one. 
So, that means u=v is my equation. OK, so when I'm here, when I'm entering my 
region, the va lue of u at this point is just v, u equals v. 

That's the hard part. Now, we need to figure out, so, we started u equa ls v. u 
increases,  increases, increases. Where does it exit? It exits one when we are here. 
What's the va lue of u here? One. That one is easier, right? This side here, so, this 
side here is x equa ls one. That means u equals one. So, we start at u equals one. 
Now, we've done the inner integral. What about the outer? So, we have to figure out, 
what is the first and what is the last value of v that we'll want to consider? Well, if 
you look at a ll these hyperbola's, xy equals constant. What's the smallest va lue of xy 
that we'll ever want to  look at in here? 

Zero, OK. Let me actua lly, where's my yellow chalk? Is it, no, ah. So, this one here, 
that's actua lly v=0. So, we'll start at v equa ls zero. And, what's the  last hyperbola 
we want to look at? Well, it's the one that's right there in the corner. It's this one 
here. And, that's v equa ls one. So, v goes from zero to one. OK, and now, we can 
compute this. I mean,  it's not particularly easier than that one, but it's not harder 
either. How else could we have gotten these bounds, because that was quite evil. So, 
I would like to recommend that you try this way in case it works well. Just try to 
picture, what are the slices in terms of u and v, and how you travel on them, where 
you enter, where you leave, staying in the xy picture. If that somehow doesn't work 
well, another way is to draw the picture in the uv coord inates. 

So, sw itch to a uv picture. So, what do I mean by that? Well, we had here a p icture 
in xy coord inates where we had our sides. And, we are going to try to draw what it 
looks like in terms of u and v. So, here we said this  is x equa ls one. That becomes u 
equa ls one. So, we'll draw u equals one. This side we said is y equals one becomes u 
equa ls v. That's what we've done over there. OK, so u equals v. Now, we have the 
two other sides to dea l w ith. 

Well, let's look at this one first. So, that was x equals zero. What happens when x 
equa ls zero? Well, both u and v are zero. So,  this side actua lly gets squished  in the 
change of variab les. It's a b it strange, but it's a bit the same thing as when you 
switch to polar coordinates at the origin, r is zero but theta can be anything. It's not 
always one point is one point. So anyway, this is the origin, and then the last side, y 
equa ls zero, and x varies just becomes v equa ls zero. 

So, somehow, in the change of variab les, this square becomes this triangle. And 
now, if we want to integrate du dv, it means we are going to slice by v equals 
constant. So, we are going  to integrate over slices like this, and you see for each 
value of v, we go from u equa ls v to u equals one. And, v goes from zero to one. OK, 
so you get the same bounds just by draw ing a d ifferent picture. So, it's up to you to 
decide whether you prefer to think on this picture or draw that one instead. It 
depends on which prob lems you're doing.
