Transcript â€“ Lecture 10 

OK, let's start. Thanks. So, today we are going to continue looking at critical points, 
and we'll learn how to actually decide whether a typical point is a minimum, 
maximum, or a saddle point. So, that's the ma in top ic for today. So, remember 
yesterday, we looked at critical points of functions of severa l variables. And, so a 
critica l point functions, we have two values, x and y. That's a point where the partial 
derivatives are both zero. And, we've seen that there's various kinds of critica l 
points. There's loca l minima. So, maybe I should show the function on this contour 
plot,there  is loca l maxima, which are like that. And, there's saddle points which are 
neither minima nor maxima. 

And, of course, if you have a rea l function, then  it would be more comp licated. It w ill 
have severa l critical points. So, this example here, well, you see on the p lot that 
there is two maxima. And, there is in the middle, between them, a saddle point. And, 
actually, you can see them on the contour plot. On the contour plot, you see the 
maxima because the  level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the 
maximum. And, you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve 
that makes a  figure eight. It crosses itself. And,  if you move up or down here, so 
along the y d irection, the va lues of the function will decrease. 

Along the x direction, the values will increase. So, you can see usua lly quite easily 
where are the critical points just by  looking either at the graph or at the contour 
plots. So, the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the va lues to tell 
a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same. Just, of 
course, in one case, the values increase, and in another one they decrease. 

So, the question -- -- is, how do we decide -- -- between the various possib ilities? 
So, local minimum, loca l maximum, or saddle point. So, and, in fact, why do we 
care? Well, the other question is how do we find the global minimum/maximum of a 
function? So, here what I should point out, well, first of all, to decide where the 
function is the largest, in genera l you'll have actually to compare the values. For 
example, here, if you want to know, what is the maximum of this function? Well, we 
have two obvious cand idates. We have this local maximum and that local maximum. 
And, the question is, which one is the higher of the two? Well, in this case, actua lly, 
there is actua lly a tie for maximum. 

But,  in genera l, you would have to compute the function at both points, and compare 
the values if you know that it's three at one of them and four at the other. Well, four 
wins. The other thing that you see here is if you are looking  for the minimum of this 
function, well, the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points. So, 
where's the minimum? Well, it looks like the minimum is actua lly out there on the 
boundary or at infinity. So, that's another feature. The g lobal minimum or maximum 
doesn't have to be at a critical point. It could a lso be, somehow, on the side in some 
limiting situation where one variab le stops being in the a llowed  rang of values or 
goes to infinity. 

So, we have to actua lly check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function 
to know where, actually, the minimum and maximum w ill be. So, in genera l, I should 
point out, these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at 
infinity. So, by that, I mean on the boundary of a doma in of definition that we are 
considering. And so, we have to try both. OK, but so we'll get back to that. For now, 
let's try to  focus on the question of, you know, what's the type of the critica l point? 
So, we'll use something that's known as the second derivative test. And, in principle, 
well, the idea is kind of similar to what you do w ith the function of one variable, 
namely, the function of one variable. 

If the derivative is zero, then you know that you should look at the second 
derivative. And, that w ill tell you whether it's curving up or down whether you have a 
loca l max and the local min. And, the main problem here is, of course, we have more 
possible situations, and we have several derivatives. So, we have to think a b it 
harder about how we'll decide. But, it w ill aga in  involve the second derivative. 

OK, so  let's start w ith just an easy example that will be useful to us because actually 
it will provide the basis for the genera l method. OK, so we are first going to consider 
a case where we have a function that's actua lly just quadratic. So, let's say I have a 
function, W of (x,y) that's of the form ax^2 bxy cy^2. OK, so this guy has a critical 
point at the origin because if you take the derivative w ith respect to x, well, and if 
you plug x equals y equals zero, you'll get zero, and same with respect to y. You can 
also see, if you try to do a linear approximation of this, well, all these guys are much 
sma ller than x and y when x and y are sma ll. So, the linear approximation, the 
tangent plane to the graph is really just w=0. 

OK, so, how do we do it? Well, yesterday we actually did an example. It was a b it 
more complicated than that, but  let me do it, so remember, we were looking at 
something that started w ith x^2 2xy 3y^2. And, there were other terms. But, let's 
forget them now. And, what we did is we said, well, we can rewrite this as (x y)^2 
2y^2. And now, this is a sum of two squares. So, each of these guys has to be 
nonnegative. And so, the orig in will be a minimum. Well, it turns out we can do 
something similar in general no matter what the va lues of a, b, and c are. We'll just 
try to first complete things to a square. OK, so let's do that. 

So, in general, well, let me be slightly less general, and let me assume that a is not 
zero because otherw ise I can't do what I'm going to do. So, I'm going  to write this as 
a times x^2 plus b over axy. And then I have my cy^2. And now this looks like the 
beginning of the square of something, OK, just like what we d id over there. So, what 
is it the square of? Well, you'd start with x plus I cla im if I put b over 2a times y and 
I square it,  then see the cross term two times x times b over 2a y will become b over 
axy. Of course, now  I a lso get some y squares out of this. 

How many y squares do I get? Well, I get b^2 over 4a^2 times a. So, I get b2 over 
4a y^2. So, and I want, in  fact, c times y^2. So, the number of y^2 that I should 
add is c minus b^2 over 4a. OK, let's see that again. If I expand this thing, I w ill get 
ax^2 plus a times b over 2a  times 2xy. That's going to be my bxy. But, I also get 
b^2 over 4a^2 y^2 times a. That's b^2 over 4ay^2. And, that cancels out with this 
guy here. And then, I will be left w ith cy^2. OK, do you see it kind of? 

OK, if not, well, try expanding this square aga in. OK, maybe I'll do it just to convince 
you. But, so if I expand this, I w ill get A times, let me put that  in a d ifferent color 
because you shouldn't write that down. It's just to convince you aga in. So, if you 

don't see it yet, let's expend this thing. We'll get a times x^2 plus a times 2xb over 
2ay. Well, the two A's cancel out. We get bxy p lus a times the square of that's going 
to be b^2 over 4a^2 y^2 plus cy^2 minus b^2 over 4ay^2. 

Here, the a and the a simplifies, and now these two terms simplify and give me just 
cy^2 in the end. OK, and that's kind of unreadable after I've canceled everything, 
but if you  follow it, you see that basica lly I've just rewritten my initia l function. OK, 
is that kind of OK? I mean, otherwise there's just no substitute. You'll have to do it 
yourself, I'm afraid. OK, so, let me continue to p lay with this. So, I'm just going to 
put this in a slightly different form just to clear the denominators. OK, so, I w ill 
instead write this as one over 4a times the big thing. 

So, I'm going  to just put 4a^2 times x plus b over 2ay squared. OK, so far I have 
the same thing as here. I just introduced the 4a that cancels out, plus for the other 
one, I'm just clearing the denominator. I end up with (4ac-b^2)y^2. OK, so that's a 
lot of terms. But, what does it look like? Well, it looks like, so we have some 
constant factors, and here we have a square, and here we have a square. So, 
basically, we've written this as a sum of two squares, well, a sum or a difference of 
two squares. And, maybe that's what we need to figure out to know what kind of 
point  it is because, see, if you take a sum of two squares, that you will know that 
each square takes nonnegative values. 

And you w ill have, the function will always take nonnegative values. So, the orig in 
will be a minimum. Well, if you have a difference of two squares that typ ically you'll 
have a saddle point because depending on whether one or the other is larger, you 
will have a positive or a negative quantity. OK, so I cla im there's various cases to 
look at. So,  let's see. So, in fact, I cla im there w ill be three cases. And, that's good 
news for us because after a ll, we want to d istinguish between three possib ilities. So, 
let's first do away w ith the most comp licated one. What if 4ac minus b^2 is 
negative? Well, if it's negative, then it means what I have between the brackets is, 
so the first guy  is obviously a positive quantity, while the second one will be 
something negative times y2. 

So, it w ill be a negative quantity. OK, so one term is positive. The other is negative. 
That tells us we actua lly have a sadd le point. We have,  in fact, written our function 
as a difference of two squares. OK, is that convincing? So, if you want, what I could 
do is actua lly I could change my coordinates, have new coordinates ca lled u equals x 
b over 2ay, and v, actually, well, I could keep y, and that it would look like the 
difference of squares d irectly. 

OK, so  that's the first case. The second case is where 4ac-b^2 = 0. Well, what 
happens if that's zero? Then it means that this term over there goes away. So, what 
we have is just one square. OK, so what that means is actually that our function 
depends only on one direction of things. In the other d irection, it's going to actua lly 
be degenerate. So, for example,  forget a ll the clutter in there. Say I give you just 
the function of two variab les, w equals just x^2. So, that means  it doesn't depend 
on y at all. And, if I try to plot the graph, it w ill  look like, well, x is here. 

So, it w ill depend on x in that way, but it doesn't depend on y at a ll. So, what the 
graph looks like is something like that. OK, basically it's a valley whose bottom is 
completely flat. So, that means, actua lly, we have a degenerate critical point. It's 
called degenerate because there is a direction in which nothing happens. And, in 
fact, you have critical points everywhere along the y axis. Now, whether the square 

that we have is x or something else, namely, x plus b over 2a y, it doesn't matter. I 
mean, it w ill still get this degenerate behavior. But there's a direction in which 
nothing happens because we just have the square of one quantity. 

I'm sure that 300 students means 300 different ring tones, but I'm not eager to hear 
all of them, thanks. [LAUGHTER] OK, so, this is what's ca lled a degenerate critical 
point, and [LAUGHTER]. OK, so basically we'll leave  it here. We won't actua lly try to 
figure out further what happens, and the reason for that is that when you have an 
actual function, a genera l function, not just one that's quadratic like this, then there 
will actually be other terms maybe involving higher powers, maybe x^3 or y^3 or 
things like that. 

And then, they w ill mess up what happens in this valley. And, it's a situation where 
we won't be able, actually, to tell automatica lly just by looking at second derivatives 
what happens. See, for example, in a  function of one variab le, if you have just a 
function of one variable, say,  f of x equa ls x to the five, well, if you try to decide 
what type of point the orig in is, you're going to take the second derivative. It w ill be 
zero, and then you can conclude. Those things depend on higher order derivatives. 

So, we just won't like that case. We just won't try to figure out what's going on here. 
Now, the last situation is if 4ac-b^2 is positive. So, then, that means that actually 
we've written things. The big bracket up there is a sum of two squares. So, that 
means that we've written w as one over 4a times p lus something squared p lus 
something else squared, OK? So, these guys have the same sign, and that means 
that this term here w ill a lways be greater than or equal to zero. And that means that 
we should either have a maximum or minimum. How we find out which one it is? 

Well, we look at the sign of a, exactly. OK? So, there's two sub-cases. One is if a is 
positive, then, this quantity overall w ill a lways be nonnegative. And that means we 
have a minimum, OK? And, if a  is negative on the other hand, so that means that we 
multip ly this positive quantity by a negative number, we get something that's always 
negative. So, zero is actually the maximum. OK, is that clear for everyone? Yes? 

Sorry, yeah, so I said in the example w equa ls x^2, it doesn't depend on y. So, the 
more general situation is w equals some constant. Well, I guess it's a times (x b over 
2a times y)^2. So, it does depend on x and y, but it only depends on this 
combination. OK, so if I choose to move in some other perpendicular direction, in the 
direction where this remains constant, so maybe if I set x equals minus b over 2a y, 
then this rema ins zero all the time. 

So, there's a degenerate d irection in which I stay at the minimum or maximum, or 
whatever it  is that I have. OK, so that's why it's called degenerate. There is a 
direction in which nothing happens. OK, yes? Yes, yeah, so that's a very good 
question. So, there's going to be the second derivative test. Why do not have 
derivatives yet? Well, that's because I've been looking at this special example where 
we have a function like this. And, so I don't actually need to  take derivatives yet. 
But, secretly, that's because a, b, and c will be the second derivatives of the 
function, actually, 2a, b, and 2c. So now, we are going to go to general function. And 
there, instead of having these coefficients a, b, and c g iven to us, we'll have to 
compute them as second derivatives. 

OK, so here, I'm basica lly setting the stage for what will be the actual criterion we'll 
use using second derivatives. Yes? So, yeah, so what you have a degenerate critical 

point, it could be a degenerate minimum, or a degenerate maximum depending on 
the sign of a. But, in genera l, once you start having functions, you don't really know 
what will happen anymore. It could also be a degenerate sadd le, and so on. So, we 
won't really be ab le to tell. 

Yes? It  is possible to have a degenerate sadd le point. For example, if I gave you x^3 
y^3, you can convince yourself that if you take x and y to be negative, it w ill be 
negative. If x and y are positive, it's positive. And, it has a very degenerate critica l 
point at the origin. So, that's a degenerate saddle point. We don't see it here 
because that doesn't happen if you have only quadratic terms like that. You need to 
have higher-order terms to see it happen. 

OK. OK, so let's continue. Before we continue, but see, I wanted to point out one 
sma ll thing. So, here, we have the magic quantity, 4ac minus b^2. You've probably 
seen that before in your life. Yet,  it looks like the quadratic formula, except that one 
involves b^2-4ac. But that's really the same thing. OK, so let's see, where does the 
quadratic formula come in here? Well, let me write things d ifferently. OK, so we've 
manipulated things, and got into a conclusion. But, let me just do a different 
manipulation, and write this now instead as y^2 times a times x over y squared p lus 
b(x over y) plus c. OK, see, that's the same thing that I had before. 

Well, so now this quantity here is always nonnegative. What about this one? Well, of 
course, this one depends on x over y. It means it depends on which d irection you're 
going to move away from the origin, which ratio between x and y you w ill consider. 
But, I cla im there's two situations. One is, so, let's try to reformulate things. So, if a 
discriminate here is positive, then it means that these have roots and these have 
solutions. 

And, that means that this quantity can be both positive and negative. This quantity 
takes positive and negative va lues. One way to convince yourself is just to, you 
know, p lot at^2 bt c. You know that there's two roots. So, it might look like this, or 
might look like that depend ing on the sign of a. But,  in either case, it w ill take values 
of both signs. So, that means that your function will take values of both signs. 

The va lue takes both positive and negative va lues. And, so that means we have a 
saddle point, while the other situation, when b^2-4ac is negative -- -- means that 
this equation is quadratic never takes the va lue, zero. So, it's a lways positive or it's 
always negative, depending on the sign of a. So, the other case is if b^2-4ac is 
negative, then the quadratic doesn't have a solution. And it could look like this or like 
that depending on whether a is positive or a is negative. 

So, in particular, that means that ax over y2 plus bx over y plus c is a lways positive 
or always negative depend ing on the sign of a. And then, that tells us that our 
function, w, w ill be always positive or a lways negative. And then we'll get a minimum 
or maximum. OK, we'll have a min or a max depend ing on which situation we are in. 
OK, so  that's another way to derive the same answer. And now, you see here why 
the d iscriminate p lays a role. That's because it exactly tells you whether this 
quadratic quantity has a lways the same sign, or whether it can actually cross the 
value, zero, when you have the root of a quadratic. 

OK, so hopefully at this stage you are happy with one of the two explanations, at 
least. And now, you are w illing to believe, I hope, that we have basica lly a way of 
deciding what type of critica l point we have in the specia l case of a quadratic 

function. OK, so, now what do we do with the general function? Well, so  in genera l, 
we want to look at second derivatives. OK, so now we are getting to the real stuff. 
So, how many second derivatives do we have? That's maybe the first thing we 
should figure out. Well, we can take the derivative first with respect to x, and then 
again with respect to x. OK, that g ives us something we denote by partia l square f 
over partial x squared or fxx. 

Then, there's another one which is fxy, which means you take the derivative with 
respect to x, and then w ith respect to y. Another thing you can do, is do  first 
derivative respect to y, and then with respect to x. That would be fyx. Well, good 
news. These are actually always equa l to each other. OK, so it's the fact that we will 
admit, it's actually not very hard to check. So these are a lways the same. 

We don't need to worry about which one we do. That's one computation that we 
won't need to do. We can save a bit of effort. And then, we have the last one, 
namely, the second partial w ith respect to y and y fyy. OK, so we have three of 
them. So, what does the second derivative test say? It says, say that you have a 
critica l point (x0, y0) of a function of two variables, f, and then let's compute the 
partial derivatives. So, let's call capital A the second derivative with respect to x. 
Let's call capital B the second derivative w ith respect to x and y. And C equals fyy at 
this point, OK? 

So, these are just numbers because we first compute the second derivative, and 
then we p lug in the values of x and y at the critical point. So, these w ill just be 
numbers. And now, what we do is we look at the quantity AC-B^2. I am not 
forgetting the four. You will see why there isn't one. So, if AC-B^2 is positive,  then 
there's two sub-cases. If A is positive,  then it's  local minimum. The second case, so, 
still, if AC-B^2 is positive, but A is negative, then it's going to be a local maximum. 
And, if AC-B^2 is negative, then it's a saddle point, and  fina lly, if AC-B^2 is zero, 
then we actually cannot compute. 

We don't know whether it's going to be a minimum, a maximum, or a sadd le. We 
know it's degenerate in some way, but we don't know what type of point it is. OK, so 
that's actua lly what you need to remember. If you are formula oriented, that's all 
you need to remember about today. But, let's try to understand why, how this comes 
out of what we had there. OK, so, I think maybe I actua lly want to keep, so maybe I 
want to keep this midd le board because it actually has, you know, the recipe that we 
found before the quadratic function. 

So, let me move directly over there and try to relate our old recipe with the new. OK, 
you are easily amused. OK, so first, let's check that these two things say the same 
thing in the specia l case that we are looking at. OK, so  let's verify in the specia l case 
where the function was ax^2 bxy cy^2. So -- Well, what is the second derivative 
with respect to x and x? If I take the second derivative w ith respect to x and x, so 
first I want to take maybe the derivative with respect to x. But first, let's take the 
first partia l, Wx. That w ill be 2ax by, right? So, Wxx w ill be, well, let's take a partia l 
with respect to x aga in. That's 2a. Wxy, I take the partia l respect to y, and we'll get 
b. 

OK, now we need, a lso, the partia l w ith respect to y. So, Wy is bx 2cy. In case you 
don't believe what I told you about the mixed partials, Wyx, well, you can check. And 
it's, again, b. So, they are, indeed, the same thing. And, Wyy will be 2c. So, if we 

now look at these quantities, that tells us, well, big A  is two little a, big B is little b, 
big C is two little c. So, AC-B^2 is what we used to call four little ac minus b2. 

OK, ooh. [LAUGHTER] So, now you can compare the cases. They are not listed in the 
same order just to make it harder. So, we sa id first, so the saddle case is when AC-
B^2 in b ig letters is negative, that's the same as 4ac-b2 in lower case is negative. 
The case where capita l AC-B2 is positive, loca l min and loca l max corresponds to this 
one. And, the case where we can't conclude was what used to be the degenerate 
one. OK, so at least we don't seem to have messed up when copying the formula. 
Now, why does that work more generally than that? 

Well, the answer that is, aga in, Taylor approximation. Aww. OK, so let me just do 
here quadratic approximation. So, quadratic approximation tells me the following 
thing. It tells me, if I have a function,  f of xy, and I want to understand the change 
in f when I change x and y a little bit. Well, there's the first-order terms. There is the 
linear terms that by now you should know and be comfortab le with. That's fx times 
the change  in x. And then, there's fy times the change in y. OK, that's the starting 
point. 

But now, of course, if x and y, sorry, if we are at the critical point,  then that's going 
to be zero at the critical point. So, that term actually goes away, and that's a lso zero 
at the critical point. So, that term also goes away. OK, so linear approximation is 
really no good. We need more terms. So, what are the next terms? Well, the next 
terms are quadratic terms, and so I mean, if you remember the Taylor formula  for a 
function of a single variable, there was the derivative times x minus x0 plus one ha lf 
of a second derivative times x-x0^2. And see, this side here  is really Taylor 
approximation in one variab le  looking only at x. But of course, we also have terms 
involving y, and terms involving simultaneously x and y. 

And, these terms are fxy times change in x times change in y plus one half of fyy(y-
y0)^2. There's no one ha lf in the middle because, in  fact, you would have two terms, 
one for xy, one for yx, but they are the same. And then, if you want to continue, 
there is actua lly cub ic terms involving the third derivatives, and so on, but we are 
not actua lly looking at them. And so, now, when we do  this approximation, well, the 
type of critical point remains the same when we rep lace the function by this 
approximation. And so, we can app ly the argument that we used to deduce things in 
the quadratic case. In  fact, it still works in the general case using this approximation 
formula. 

So -- The genera l case reduces to the quadratic case. And now, you see actua lly 
why, well, here you see, again, how this coefficient which we used to call little a is 
also one half of capita l A. And, same here, this coefficient is what we call capital A. 
And same here: this coefficient is what we call capital B or little b, and this 
coefficient here is what we called little c or one half of cap ita l C. And then, when you 
replace these into the various cases that we had here, you end up with the second 
derivative test. 

So, what about the degenerate case? Why can't we just say, well, it's going to be a 
degenerate critical point? So, the reason is that this approximation formula is 
reasonable only if the higher order terms are negligib le. OK, so in fact, secretly, 
there's more terms. This is only an approximation. There would be terms involving 
third derivatives, and maybe even beyond that. And, so it is not to generate case, 
they don't actua lly matter because the shape of the function, the shape of the graph, 

is actua lly determined by the quadratic terms. But, in the degenerate case, see, if I 
start w ith this and I add something even very, very sma ll along the y axis, then that 
can be enough to bend this very slightly up or slightly down, and turn my degenerate 
point  in to either a minimum or a saddle point. 

And, I won't be ab le to tell until I go  further in the list of derivatives. So,  in the 
degenerate case, what actually happens depends on the higher order derivatives. So, 
we will need to analyze things more carefully. Well, we're not going to bother with 
that in this class. So, we'll just say, well, we cannot compute, OK? I mean, you have 
to realize that in rea l life, you have to be extremely unlucky for this quantity to end 
up being exactly 0. 

[LAUGHTER] Well, if that happens, then what you should do is maybe try by 
inspection. See if there's a good reason why the function should always be positive 
or always be negative, or something. Or, you know, p lot it on a computer and see 
what happens. But, otherw ise we can't compute. OK, so let's do an example. So, 
probably I should leave this on so that we still have the test w ith us. And, instead, 
OK, so I'll do my example here. 

OK, so just an example. Let's look at f of (x, y) = x y 1/xy, where x and y are 
positive. So, I'm looking only at the first quadrant. OK, I mean, I'm doing this 
because I don't want the denominator to become zero. So, I'm just looking at the 
situation. So, let's look first for, so, the question will be, what are the minimum and 
maximum of this function? So, the first thing we should do to answer this question is 
look for critica l points, OK? 

So, for that, we have to compute the first derivatives. OK, so  fx is one minus one 
over x^2y, OK? Take the derivative of one over x, that's negative one over x^2. 
And, we'll want to set that equal to zero. And fy  is one minus one over xy^2. And, 
we want to set that equal to zero. So, what are the equations we have to solve? 
Well, I guess x^2y equals one, I mean, if I move this guy over here I get one over 
x^2y equals one. 

That's x^2y equals one, and xy^2 equa ls one. What do you get by comparing these 
two? Well, x and y should both be, OK, so yeah, I agree with you that one and one is 
a solution. Why is it the only one? So,  first, if I divide this one by that one, I get x 
over y equals one. So, it tells me x equals y. And then, if x equals y, then if I put 
that into here, it w ill give me y^3 equals one, which tells me y equa ls one, and 
therefore, x equals one as well. OK, so, there's only one solution. There's only one 
critica l point, which is going to be (1, 1). 

OK, so, now here's where you do a bit of work. What do you think of that critica l 
point? OK, I see some va lid votes. I see some, OK, I see a lot of people answering 
four. [LAUGHTER] that seems to suggest that maybe you haven't completed the 
second derivative yet. Yes, I see someone g iving the correct answer. I see some 
people not giving quite the correct answer. I see more and more correct answers. 
OK, so  let's see. To  figure out what type of point is, we should compute the second 
partial derivatives. So, fxx is, what do we get what we take the derivative of this 
with respect to x? 

Two over x^3y, OK? So, at our point, a w ill be 2. Fxy will be one over x^2y^2. So, B 
will be one. And, Fyy is going to be two over xy^3. So, C will be two. And so that 
tells us, well, AC-B^2 is four minus one. Sorry, I should probably use a different 

blackboard for that. AC-B2 is two times two minus 1^2 is three. It's positive. That 
tells us we are either a loca l minimum or loca l maximum. And, A is positive. So, it's a 
loca l minimum. And,  in fact, you can check it's the globa l minimum. What about the 
maximum? Well,  if a maximum  is not actua lly at a critical point,  it's on the boundary, 
or at infinity. 

See, so we have actua lly to check what happens when x and y go to zero or to 
infinity. Well, if that happens, if x or y goes to infinity, then the function goes to 
infinity. Also, if x or y goes to zero, then one over xy goes to infinity. So, the 
maximum, well, the function goes to infinity when x goes to infinity or y goes to 
infinity, or x and y go to zero. So, it's not at a critical point. OK, so, in general, we 
have to check both the critica l points and the boundaries to decide what happens. 
OK, the end. Have a nice weekend.
