Transcript â€“ Lecture 2 

Thank you. Let's continue w ith vectors and operations of them. Remember we saw 
the topic yesterday was dot product. And remember the definition of dot product, 
well, the dot product of two vectors is obtained by multip lying the first component 
with the first component, the second w ith the second and so on and summing these 
and you get the sca lar. 

And the geometric interpretation of that is that you can also take the length of A, 
take the length of B multiply them and multip ly that by the cosine of the angle 
between the two vectors. We have seen several applications of that. One application 
is to  find lengths and ang les. For example, you can use this relation to give you the 
cosine of the ang le between two vectors is the dot product d ivided by the product of 
the lengths. 

Another app lication that we have is to detect whether two vectors are perpend icular. 
To decide if two vectors are perpendicular to each other, a ll we have to do is 
compute our dot product and see if we get zero. And one further application that we 
did not have time to d iscuss yesterday that I w ill mention very quickly is to find 
components of, let's say, a vector A a long a direction u. So some unit vector. Let me 
exp lain. Let's say that I have some direction. For examp le, the horizontal axis on this 
blackboard. But it could be any direction in space. And, to describe this direction, 
maybe I have a unit vector along this axis. Let's say that I have any of a vector A 
and I want to  find out what is the component of A a long u. 

That means what is the length of this projection of A to the g iven d irection? This 
thing here is the component of A along u. Well, how do we find that? Well, we know 
that here we have a  right angle. So this component is just length A times cosine of 
the angle between A and u. But now that means I should be able to compute it very 
easily because that's the same as length A times length u times cosine theta because 
u is a unit vector. It is a unit vector. 

That means this is equal to one. And so that's the same as the dot product between 
A and u. That is very easy. And, of course, the most of just cases of that is say, for 
example, we want just to  find the component along i hat, the unit vector along the x 
axis. Then you do the dot product with i hat, which  is 100. What you get is the first 
component. And that is, indeed, the x component of a vector. 

Similarly, say you want the z component you do the dot product w ith k that g ives 
you the last component of your vector. But the same works w ith a unit vector in any 
direction. So what is an application of that? Well, for examp le, in physics maybe you 
have seen situations where you have a pendulum that swings. You have maybe 
some mass at the end of the string and that mass swings back and  forth on a circle. 
And to ana lyze this mechanica lly you want to use, of course, Newton's Laws of 
Mechanics and you want to use forces and so on, but I claim  that components of 
vectors are useful here to understand what happens geometrica lly. 

What are the forces exerted on this pendulum? Well, there is its weight, which 
usua lly points downwards, and there is the tension of the string. And these two 
forces together are what exp lains how this pendulum is going to move back and 
forth. Now, you could try to understand the equations of motion using x, y 
coordinates or x, z or whatever you want to call them, let's say x, y. But really what 
causes the pendulum to swing back and forth and also to somehow stay a constant 
distance are phenomenal relative to this circular trajectory. For examp le, maybe 
instead of taking components along the x and y axis, we want to look at two other 
unit vectors. 

We can look at a vector, let's call it T, that is tangent to the trajectory. Sorry. Can 
you read that? It's not very readable. T is tangent to the trajectory. And, on the 
other hand, we can  introduce another vector. Let's call that N. And that one is 
normal, perpendicular to the trajectory. And so now if you think about it you can look 
at the components of the weight along the tangent d irection and a long the normal 
direction. 

And so the component of F along the tangent direction is what causes acceleration in 
the d irection a long the trajectory. It is what causes the pendulum to swing back and 
forth. And the component a long N, on the other hand. That is the part of the weight 
that tends to pull our mass away from this point. It is what is going to be responsible 
for the tension of the string. It is why the string  is taut and not actually slack and 
with things moving all over the place. That one is responsib le for the tension of a 
string. 

And now, of course, if you want to compute things, well, maybe you will ca ll this 
angle theta and then you will express things exp licitly using sines and cosines and 
you will solve for the equations of motion. That would be a very interesting physics 
problem. But, to save time, we are not going to do it. I'm sure you've seen that in 
8.01 or similar classes. And so to find these components we w ill just do dot products. 
Any questions? No. OK. Let's move onto our next topic. 

Here we have found things about lengths, ang les and stuff like that. One important 
concept that we have not understood yet in terms of vectors is area. Let's say that 
we want to find the area of this pentagon. Well, how do we compute that using 
vectors? Can we do it using vectors? Yes we can. And that  is going to be the goal. 
The first thing we should do is probab ly simplify the prob lem. We don't actually need 
to bother with pentagons. All we need to know are triang les because,  for examp le, 
you can cut that in three triangles and then sum the areas of the triangles. Perhaps 
easier, what is the area of a triang le? 

Let's start with a triangle in the plane. Well, then we need two vectors to describe it, 
say A and B here. How do we find the area of a  triangle? Well, we all know base 
times height over two. What is the base? What is the height? The area of this 
triangle is going to be one-half of the base, which is going to be the length of A. And 
the height, well, if you ca ll theta this ang le, then this is length B sine theta. Now, 
that looks a lot like the formula we had there, except for one little catch. This  is a 
sine instead of a cosine. How do we dea l w ith that? 

Well, what we could do is first find the cosine of the angle. We know how to  find the 
cosine of the ang le using dot products. Then solve for sine using sine square p lus 
cosine square equa ls one. And then p lug that back into here. Well, that works but it 
is kind of a very comp licated way of doing it. So there is an easier way. And that is 

going to be determinants, but let me expla in how we get to that maybe still doing 
elementary geometry and dot products first. 

Let's see. What we can do is instead of finding the sine of theta, well, we're not good 
at finding sines of angles but we are very good now at finding cosines of angles. 
Maybe we can find another angle whose cosine is the same as the sine of theta. Well, 
you have a lready heard about complimentary angles and how I take my vector A, my 
vector B here and I have an angle theta. Well, let's say that I rotate my vector A by 
90 degrees to get a new vector A prime. 

A prime is just A rotated by 90 degrees. Then the angle between these two guys, 
let's say theta prime, well, theta prime is 90 degrees or p i over two gradients minus 
theta. So, in particular, cosine of theta prime is equa l to sine of theta. In particular, 
that means that length A,  length B, sine theta, which is what we would need to know 
in order to  find  the area of this triangle is equal to, well, A and A prime have the 
same length so let me rep lace that by length of A prime. I am not changing 
anything, length B, cosine theta prime. And now we have something that  is much 
easier for us. 

Because that is just A prime dot B. That looks like a very good p lan. There  is only 
one sma ll thing which is we don't know yet how  to find this A prime. Well, I think  it is 
not very hard. Let's see. Actua lly, why don't you guys do the hard work? Let's say 
that I have a p lane vector A with two components a1, a2. And I want to rotate it 
counterclockwise by 90 degrees. It looks like maybe we should change some signs 
somewhere. Maybe we should do something with the components. Can you come up 
with an idea of what it might be? 

I see a lot of peop le answering three. I see some other answers, but the majority 
vote seems to be number three. M inus a2 and a1. I think I agree, so let's see. Let's 
say that we have this vector A with components a1. So a1 is here. And a2. So a2 is 
here. Let's rotate this box by 90 degrees counterclockwise. This box ends up there. 
It's the same box just flipped on its side. This thing here becomes a1 and this thing 
here becomes a2. And that means our new vector A prime is going to be --

Well, the first component looks like an a2 but it  is pointing to the left when a2 is 
positive. So, actually, it is minus a2. And the y component is going to be the same as 
this guy, so it's going to be a1. If you wanted instead to rotate clockw ise then you 
would do the opposite. You would do a2 minus a1. Is that reasonably clear for 
everyone? OK. Let's continue the ca lculation there. A prime, we have decided, is 
minus a2, a1 dot product with let's call b1 and b2, the components of B. 

Then that will be minus a2, b1 plus a1, b2 plus a1, b2. Let me write that the other 
way around, a1, b2 minus a2, b1. And that is a quantity that you may already know 
under the name of determinant of vectors A and B, which we write symbolically using 
this notation. We put A and B next to each other inside a two-by-two table and we 
put these verticals bars. And that means the determinant of these numbers, this guy 
times this guy minus this guy times this guy. That is called the determinant. 

And geometrica lly what it measures is the area, well, not of a triangle because we 
did not divide by two, but of a parallelogram formed by A and B. It measures the 
area of the parallelogram w ith sides A and B. And, of course, if you want the triang le 
then you will just divide by two. The triang le is half the para llelogram. There is one 
sma ll catch. The area usually is something that is going to be positive. This guy here 

has no reason to be positive or negative because, in  fact, well, if you compute things 
you will see that where it is supposed to go negative it depends on whether A and B 
are clockw ise or counterclockwise from each other. I mean the issue that we have --

Well, when we say the area is one-half length A, length B, sine theta that was 
assuming that theta is positive, that its sine is positive. Otherwise, if theta is 
negative maybe we need to take the absolute value of this. Just to be more truthful, 
I w ill say the determinant is either plus or minus the area. Any questions about this? 
Yes. Sorry. That is not a dot product. That is the usua l multip lication. That is  length 
A times length B times sine theta. What does that equa l? And so  that is equal to the 
area of a para llelogram. 

Sorry. Let me exp lain that again. If I have two vectors A and B, I can form a 
parallelogram w ith them or I can form a triangle. And so the area of a para llelogram 
is equal to length A, length B, sine theta, is equal to the determinant of A and B. 
While the area of a triangle is one-half of that. And, aga in, to be truthful, I should 
say these things can be positive or negative. Depend ing on whether you count the 
angle positively or negatively, you will get either the area or minus the area. The 
area is actually the absolute va lue of these quantities. 

Is that clear? OK. Yes. If you want to compute the area, you w ill just take the 
absolute va lue of the determinant. I should say the area of a parallelogram so that it 
is comp letely clear. Sorry. Do you have a question? Expla in again, sorry, was the 
question how a determinant equals the area of a para llelogram? OK. The area of a 
parallelogram  is going to be the base times the height. Let's take this guy to be the 
base. The length of a base w ill be length of A and the height will be obtained by 
taking B but only looking at the vertical part. 

That w ill be length of B times the sine of theta. That  is how I got the area of a 
parallelogram as length A, length B, sine theta. And then I d id this manipulation and 
this trick of rotating  to find a nice formula. Yes. You are asking ahead of what I am 
going to do in a  few minutes. You are asking about magnitude of A cross B. We are 
going to learn about cross products in a few minutes. And the answer is yes, but 
cross product is for vectors  in space. Here I was simp lifying things by doing things 
just in the p lane. Just bear with me for five more minutes and we w ill do things  in 
space. Yes. That  is correct. The way you compute this in practice is you just do this. 
That  is how you compute the determinant. 

Yes. What about three d imensions? Three d imensions we are going to do now. More 
questions? Should we move on? OK. Let's move to space. There are two things we 
can do in space. And you can look for the volume of solids or you can look for the 
area of surfaces. Let me start with the easier of the two. Let me start with volumes 
of solids. And we will go back to area, I promise. I cla im that there is a lso a notion of 
determinants in space. And that is going to tell us how  to find volumes. Let's say 
that we have three vectors A, B and C. And then the definition of their determinants 
going to be, the notation  for that in terms of the components is the same as over 
there. 

We put the components of A, the components of B and the components of C inside 
verticals bars. And, of course, I have to give meaning to  this. This will be a number. 
And what is that number? Well, the definition I will take is that this is a1 times the 
determinant of what I get by looking in this lower right corner. The two-by-two 
determinant b2, b3, c2, c3. Then I w ill subtract a2 times the determinant of b1, b3, 

c1, c3. And then I w ill add a3 times the determinant b1, b2, c1, c2. And each of 
these guys means, aga in, you take b2 times c3 minus c2 times b3 and this times 
that minus this time that and so on. 

In fact,  there is a total of six terms in here. And maybe some of you have already 
seen a different formula for three-by-three determinants where you directly have the 
six terms. It  is the same definition. How to remember the structure of this formula? 
Well, this is called an expansion according to the first row. So we are going to take 
the entries in the first row, a1, a2, a3 And for each of them we get the term. Namely 
we multiply it by a two-by-two determinant that we get by deleting the first row and 
the column where we are. Here the coefficient next to a1, when we delete this 
column and this row, we are left with b2, b3, c2, c3. The next one we take a2, we 
delete the row that is in it and the column that it is in. 

And we are left w ith b1, b3, c1, c3. And, similarly, with a3, we take what rema ins, 
which is b1, b2, c1, c2. Finally, last but not least, there is a minus sign here for the 
second guy. It looks like a weird formula. I mean it is a little bit weird. But it is a 
formula that you should learn because it is rea lly, rea lly useful for a lot of things. I 
should say if this looks very artificial to you and you would like to know more there is 
more in the notes, so read the notes. They will tell you a bit more about what this 
means, where it comes from and so on. If you want to know a lot more then some 
day you should take 18.06, Linear Algebra where you will learn a lot more about 
determinants in N dimensiona l space w ith N vectors. 

And there is a genera lization of this in arbitrary dimensions. In this class, we will 
only dea l w ith two or three d imensions. Yes. Why is the negative there? Well, that is 
a very good question. It has to be there so that this will actua lly equa l, well, what I 
am going to say right now is that this w ill g ive us the volume of [a box?] with sides 
A, B, C. And the formula just doesn't work if you don't put the negative. 

There  is a more fundamenta l reason which has to do with orientation of space and 
the fact that if you switch two coordinates in space then basically you change what is 
called the handedness of the coordinates. If you look at your right hand and your left 
hand, they are not actually the same. They are mirror images. And,  if you squared 
two coord inate axes,  that is what you get. That is the fundamenta l reason for the 
minus. Again, we don't need to think too much about that. All we need in this class is 
the formula. 

Why do we care about this formula? It is because of the theorem that says that 
geometrically the determinant of the three vectors A, B, C is, aga in, plus or minus. 
This determinant could be positive or negative. See those minuses and all sorts of 
stuff. Plus or minus the volume of the para llelepiped. That is just a fancy name for a 
box with para llelogram sides, in case you wonder, with sides A, B and C. You take 
the three vectors A, B and C and you form a box whose sides are a ll para llelograms. 
And when its volume is going to be the determinant. 

Other questions? I'm sorry. I cannot quite hear you. Yes. We are going to see how to 
do it geometrica lly w ithout a determinant, but then you w ill see that you actua lly 
need a determinant to compute it no matter what. We are going to go back to this 
and see another formula for volume, but you will see that really I am cheating. I 
mean somehow computationally the only way to compute it is rea lly to use a 
determinant. 

That  is correct. In genera l, I mean, actually, I could say if you look at the two-by-
two determinant, see, you can also explain it in terms of this extension. If you take 
a1 and multip ly by this one-by-one determinant b2, then you take a2 and you 
multip ly it by this one-by-one determinant b1 but you put a minus sign. And in 
general, indeed, when you expand, you would stop putting p lus, minus, plus, minus 
alternating. More about that in 18.06. Yes. There is a way to do it based on other 
rows as well, but then you have to be very careful with the sign vectors. I w ill refer 
you to the notes for that. I mean you could also do it w ith a column, by the way. I 
mean be careful about the sign rules. 

Given how little we will use determinants in this class, I mean we will use them in a 
way that is fundamental, but we won't compute much. Let's say this is going to be 
enough for us for now. After determinants now I can tell you about cross product. 
And cross product is going to be the answer to your question about area. OK. Let me 
move onto cross product. Cross product is something that you can apply to two 
vectors in space. And by that I mean rea lly in three-d imensiona l space. This  is 
something that is specific to three d imensions. The definition A cross B --

It is important to rea lly do your multip lication symbol well so that you don't mistake 
it with a dot product. Well, that is going to be a vector. That is another reason not to 
confuse it w ith dot product. Dot product gives you a number. Cross product gives 
you a vector. They are rea lly completely different operations. They are both called 
product because someone could not come up with a better name, but they are 
completely different operations. What do we do  to do the cross product of A and B? 
Well, we do something very strange. Just as I have told you that a determinant is 
something where we put numbers and we get a number, I am going to violate my 
own rule. I am going to put together a determinant in which --

Well, the last two rows are the components of the vectors A and B but the first row 
strangely consists for unit vectors i, j, k. What does that mean? Well, that is not a 
determinant in the usual sense. If you try to put that into your ca lculator, it will tell 
you there is an error. I don't know how to put vectors in there. I want numbers. 
What is means is it is symbolic notation that helps you remember what the formula 
is. The actual formula is, well, you use this definition. And, if you use that definition, 
you see that it is  i hat times some number. Let me write it as determinant of a2, a3, 
b2, b3 times i hat minus determinant a1, a3, b1, b3, j hat p lus a1, a2, b1, b2, k hat. 

And so that is the actua l definition in a way that makes complete sense, but to 
remember this formula without too much trouble it is much easier to think about it in 
these terms here. That is the definition and it gives you a vector. Now, as usual w ith 
definitions, the question is what is it good for? What is the geometric meaning of this 
very strange operation? Why do we bother to do that? Here is what it does 
geometrically. Remember a vector has two different things. It has a length and it has 
a direction. Let's start with the length. A length of a cross product is the area of the 
parallelogram  in space formed by the vectors A and B. 

Now, if you have a parallelogram in space, you can find  its area just by doing this 
calculation when you know  the coord inates of the points. You do this calculation and 
then you take the length. You take this squared plus that squared p lus that squared, 
square root. It looks like a very comp licated formula but it works and, actually, it is 
the simplest way to do it. This time we don't actually need to put plus or minus 
because the length of a vector is always positive. We don't have to worry about that. 
And what is even more magical is that not only is the length remarkab le but the 

direction is also remarkab le. The direction of A cross B is perpendicular to the plane 
of a parallelogram. 

Our two vectors A and B together in a plane. What I am telling you is that for vector 
A cross B w ill point, will stick straight out of that plane perpendicularly to it. In fact, I 
would have to be more precise. There are two ways that you can be perpendicular to 
this plane. You can be perpendicular pointing up or pointing down. How do I decide 
which? Well, there is something called the right-hand rule. 

What does the right-hand rule say? Well, there are various versions for right-hand 
rule depending on which country you learn about it. In France, given the culture, you 
even learn about it in terms of a cork screw and a w ine bottle. I will just use the 
usua l version here. You take your right hand. If you are left-handed, remember to 
take your right hand and not the left one. The other right, OK? Then place your hand 
to point in the d irection of A. Let's say my right hand is going in that direction. Now, 
curl your fingers so that they point towards B. Here that would be kind of into the 
blackboard. Don't snap any bones. If it doesn't quite work then rotate your arms so 
that you can actua lly physica lly do  it. 

Then get your thumb to stick straight out. Well, here my thumb is going to go up. 
And that tells me that A cross B will go up. Let me write that down while you 
experiment w ith it. Aga in, try not to enjoy yourselves. F irst, your right hand points 
parallel to vector A. Then your fingers point in the direction of B. Then your thumb, 
when you stick it out, is going to point in the direction of A cross B. 

Let's do a quick examp le. Where is my quick example? Here. Let's take i cross j. I 
see most of you going in the right direction. If you have it pointing in the wrong 
direction, it might mean that you are using your left hand,  for examp le. Example, I 
cla im that i cross j equals k. Let's see. I points towards us. J point to our right. I 
guess this is your right. I think. And then your thumb is going to point up. That tells 
us it is roughly pointing up. And, of course, the length should be one because if you 
take the unit square in the x, y plane,  its area is one. And the direction should be 
vertical. 

Because it should be perpendicular to the x, y plane. It looks like i cross j will be k. 
Well, let's check with the definition i, j, k. What is i? I is one, zero, zero. J is zero, 
one, zero. The coefficient of i will be zero times zero minus zero times one. That is 
zero. The coefficient of j will be one time zero minus zero times zero, that is a zero, 
minus zero j. It doesn't matter. And the coefficient of k w ill be one times one, that is 
one, minus zero times zero, so one k. So we do get i cross j equals k both ways. In 
this case, it  is easier to do it geometrically. If I give you no comp licated vectors, 
probably you will actua lly want to do  the ca lculation. 

Any questions? Yes. The coefficient of k, remember I delete the first row and the last 
column so I get this two-by-two determinant. And that two-by-two determinant is 
one times one minus zero times zero so that gives me a one. That is what you do 
with two-by-two determinants. Similarly for the others, but the others turn out to be 
zero. More questions? Yes. Let me repeat how I got the one in  front of k. Remember 
the definition of a determinant I expand according to the entries in the first row. 
When I get to k what I do is delete the first row and I delete the last column, the 
column that contains k. 

I delete these guys and these guys and I am left with this two-by-two determinant. 
Now, a two-by-two determinant, you multiply according to this downward d iagona l 
and then minus this times that. One times one, let me see here, I got one k because 
that is one times one minus zero times zero equals one. Sorry. That is rea lly hard to 
read. Maybe it w ill be easier that way. Yes. Let's try. If I do the same for i, I think I 
will also get zero. Let's do the same for i. I take  i, I delete the first row, I delete the 
first column, I get this two-by-two determinant here and I get zero times zero, that 
is zero, minus zero times one. 

That  is the other trick question. Zero times one is zero as well. So  that zero minus 
zero is zero. I hope on Monday you should get more practice in recitation about how 
to compute determinants. Hopefully, it will become very easy for you all to compute 
this next. I know the first time it is kind of a shock because there are a lot of 
numbers and a lot of things to do. Let me return to the question that you asked a b it 
earlier about how do you find actua lly volume  if I don't want to know about 
determinants? Well, let's have another look at the volume. Let's say that I have 
three vectors. 

Let me put them this way, A, B and C. And let's try to see how else I could think 
about the volume of this box. Probably you know that the volume of a parallelepiped 
is the area of a base times the height. Sorry. The volume is the area of a base times 
the height. How do we do that in practice? Well, what is the area of a base? The base 
is a para llelogram in space with sides B and C. How do we find the area of the 
parallelogram  in space? Well, we just discovered that. We can do it by taking that 
cross product. 

The area of a base, well, we take the cross product of B and C. That is not quite it 
because this is a vector. We would like a number while we take its length. That is 
pretty good. What about the height? Well, the height is going to be the component of 
A in the direction that is perpendicular to the base. Let's take a direction that is 
perpendicular to the base. Let's call that N, a unit vector in that direction. Then we 
can get the height by taking A dot n. 

That  is what we saw at the beginning of class that A dot n will tell me how much A 
goes in the direction of n. Are you still w ith me? OK. Let's keep going. Let's think 
about this vector n. How do I get it? Well, I can get it by actua lly using cross product 
as well. Because I sa id the direction perpend icular to two vectors I can get by taking 
that cross product and looking at that direction. This is still B cross C length. And this 
one  is, so I claim, n can be obtained by taking D cross C. Well, that comes in the 
right direction but it is not a unit vector. How do I get a unit vector? 

I d ivide by the length. Thanks. I take B cross C and I d ivide by length B cross C. 
Well, now  I can probably simp lify between these two guys. And so what I w ill get --
What I get out of this is that my volume equals A dot product with vector B cross C. 
But, of course, I have to be careful in which order I do it. If I do it the other way 
around, A dot B, I get a number. I cannot cross that. I really have to do the cross 
product first. 

I get the new vector. Then my dot product. The fact is that the determinant of A, B, 
C is equal to  this so-ca lled trip le product. Well, that looks good geometrica lly. Let's 
try to check whether it makes sense with the formulas, just one small thing. We saw 
the determinant is a1 times determinant b2, b3, c2, c3 minus a2 times something 
plus a3 times something. I will let you  fill in the numbers. That is this guy. What 

about this guy? Well, dot product, we take the first component of A, that is a1, we 
multip ly by the first component of B cross C. What is the first component of B cross 
C? Well,  it is this determinant b2, b3, c2, c3. 

If you put B and C  instead of A and B into there you will get the i component is this 
guy plus a2 times the second component which  is minus some determinant p lus a3 
times the third component which is, aga in, a determinant. And you can check. You 
get exactly the same expression, so everything is fine. There is no contrad iction in 
math just yet. On Tuesday we w ill continue with this and we will start going into 
matrices, equations of planes and so on. Meanwhile, have a good weekend and 
please start working on your Problem Sets so that you can ask lots of questions to 
your TAs on Monday.
