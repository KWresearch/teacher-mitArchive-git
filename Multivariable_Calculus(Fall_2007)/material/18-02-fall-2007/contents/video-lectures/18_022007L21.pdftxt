18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 21 

We were looking at vector fields last time. Last time we saw that if a vector field 
happens to be a gradient field -- -- then the line integra l can be computed actually 
by taking the change in value of the potential between the end point and the starting 
point of the curve. If we have a curve c,  from a point p0 to a point p1 then the line 
integral for work depends only on the end points and not on the actua l path we 
chose. 

We say that the line integra l is path independent. And we a lso said that the vector 
field is conservative because of conservation of energy which tells you if you start at 
a point and you come back to the same point then you haven't gotten any work out 
of that force. If we have a closed curve then the line integra l for work is just zero. 
And, basica lly, we say that these properties are equiva lent being a gradient field or 
being path independent or being conservative. And what I promised to you  is that 
today we would see a criterion to decide whether a vector field is a gradient field or 
not and how to find the potentia l function if it is a grad ient field. 

So, that is the top ic for today. The question is testing whether a g iven vector field, 
let's say M and N comp liments, is a gradient field. For that, well, let's start w ith an 
observation. Say that it is a gradient field. That means that the first component of a 
field is just the partial of f w ith respect to some variable x and the second component 
is the partial of f with respect to y. Now we have seen an interesting property of the 
second partia l derivatives of the function, which is if you take the partial derivative 
first with respect to x, then with respect to y, or first w ith respect to y, then with 
respect to x you get the same thing. 

We know f sub xy equals f sub yx, and that means M sub y equals N sub x. If you 
have a gradient field then  it should have this property. You take the y component, 
take the derivative with respect to x, take the x component, differentiate with 
respect to y, you should get the same answer. And that is important to know. So, I 
am going to put that in a box. It is a broken box. The cla im that I want to make is 
that there is a converse of sorts. This is actua lly basica lly all we need to check. 

Conversely, if, and I am going to put here a condition, My equa ls Nx, then F is a 
gradient field. What  is the cond ition that I need  to put here? Well, we w ill see a more 
precise version of that next week. But for now let's just say if our vector field is 
defined and differentiable everywhere in the plane. We need, actually, a vector field 
that is well-defined everywhere. You are not a llowed to have somehow places where 
it is not well-defined. Otherwise, actually, you have a counter examp le on your 
problem set this week. If you look at the  last problem on the prob lem set this week, 
it g ives you a vector field that satisfies this cond ition everywhere where it is defined. 
But, actually, there is a point where it is not defined. And that causes it, actua lly, to 
somehow --

I mean everything that I am going to say today breaks down  for that examp le 
because of that. I mean, we will shed more light on this a b it later with the notion of 

simply connected regions and so on. But for now let's just say if it is defined 
everywhere and it satisfies this criterion then it is a gradient field. If you ignore the 
technical cond ition, being a gradient field means essentially the same thing as having 
this property. That  is what we need to check. 

Let's look at an examp le. Well, one vector field that we have been  looking at a lot 
was - yi xj. Remember that was the vector field that looked like a rotation at the unit 
speed. I think  last time we already decided that this guy should not be a llowed to be 
a grad ient field and should not be conservative because if we integrate on the unit 
circle then we would get a positive answer. But let's check that indeed it fails our 
test. Well, let's call this M and let's call this guy N. 

If you look at partial M, partia l y, that is going to be a negative one. If you take 
partial N, partia l x, that is going to be one. These are not the same. So,  indeed, this 
is not a gradient field. Any questions about that? Yes? Your question is if I have the 
property M sub y equa ls N sub x only  in a certain part of a plane for some va lues of x 
and y, can I conclude these things? And it is a gradient field in that part of the p lane 
and conservative and so on. 

The answer for now is, in general, no. And when we spend a b it more time on it, 
actually, maybe I should move that up. Maybe we will talk about it later this week 
instead of when I had p lanned. There is a notion what it means for a  reg ion to be 
without holes. Basically, if you have that kind of property in a  region that doesn't 
have any holes inside it then things will work. The problem comes from a vector field 
satisfying this criterion in a region but it has a hole in it. Because what you don't 
know is whether your potential is actually well-defined and takes the same value 
when you move a ll around  the hole. It might come back to take a different value. If 
you look carefully and think hard about the example in the problem sets that is 
exactly what happens there. 

Again, I w ill say more about that later. For now we basica lly need our function to be, 
I mean, I should still say if you have this property for a vector field that is not quite 
defined everywhere, you are more than welcome, you know, you should probab ly 
still try to look for a potential using methods that we will see. But something might 
go wrong later. You might end up w ith a potential that is not well-defined. 

Let's do another example. Let's say that I give you this vector field. And this a here 
is a number. The question is for which value of a is this going to be possib ly a 
gradient? If you have your flashcards then that is a good time to use them to vote, 
assuming that the number is sma ll enough to be made with. Let's try to think about 
it. We want to call this guy M. We want to call that guy N. 

And we want to test M sub y versus N sub x. I don't see anyone. I see peop le doing 
it with their hands, and  that works very well. OK. The question is for which value of a 
is this a gradient? I see various peop le w ith the correct answer. OK. That a strange 
answer. That is a good answer. OK. The vote seems to be for a equals eight. Let's 
see. What if I take M sub y? That is going to be just ax. And N sub x? That is 8x. I 
would like a equals eight. By the way, when you set these two equal to each other, 
they really have to be equa l everywhere. You don't want to somehow solve for x or 
anything like that. You just want these expressions, in terms of x and y, to be the 
same quantities. I mean you cannot say if x equals z they are always equa l. 

Yeah, that is true. But that is not what we are asking. Now we come to the next 
logical question. Let's say that we have passed the test. We have put a equa ls eight 
in here. Now it should be a grad ient field. The question is how do we find the 
potential? That becomes eight from now on. The question is how do we find the 
function which has this as grad ient? One option  is to  try to guess. Actua lly, quite 
often you w ill succeed that way. But that is not a va lid method on next week's test. 
We are going to see two d ifferent systematic methods. And you should be using one 
of these because guessing doesn't always work. 

And, actua lly, I can come up w ith examp les where if you try to guess you will surely 
fail. I can come up w ith trick ones, but I don't want to put that on the test. The next 
stage is finding the potentia l. And let me just emphasize that we can only do that if 
step one was successful. If we have a vector field that cannot possib ly be a gradient 
then we shouldn't try to look for a potential. It is kind of obvious but is probab ly 
worth pointing out. There are two methods. The first method that we will see is 
computing line integra ls. 

Let's see how that works. Let's say that I take some path that starts at the origin. 
Or, actually, anywhere you want, but let's take the orig in. That is my favorite point. 
And let's go to a point with coordinates (x1, y1). And  let's take my favorite curve 
and compute the line integra l of that field, you know, the work done a long the curve. 
Well, by the fundamental theorem, that should be equal to the value of the potential 
at the end point minus the va lue at the orig in. That means I can actually write f of 
(x1, y1) equals --

-- that line integral plus the value at the origin. And that is just a constant. We don't 
know what it  is. And, actua lly, we can choose what it is. Because if you have a 
potential, say that you have some potential function. And let's say that you add one 
to it. It is still a potential function. Adding one doesn't change the grad ient. You can 
even add 18 or any number that you want. This  is just going to be an integration 
constant. It is the same thing as,  in one variable ca lculus, when you take the anti-
derivative of a  function  it is only defined up to adding the constant. We have this 
integration constant, but apart from  that we know that we should be ab le to get a 
potential from this. 

And this we can compute using the definition of the line integral. And we don't know 
what little f is, but we know what the vector field is so we can compute that. Of 
course, to do the calculation we probab ly don't want to use this kind of path. I mean 
if that is your favorite path then that is fine, but it  is not very easy to compute the 
line integra l along this, especia lly since I d idn't tell you what the definition is. There 
are easier favorite paths to have. 

For example, you can go on a stra ight line from  the origin to that point. That would 
be slightly easier. But then there is one easier. The easiest of all, probab ly, is to just 
go first along the x-axis to (x1, 0) and then go up parallel to the y-axis. Why  is that 
easy? Well, that  is because when we do the line  integral it becomes M dx N dy. And 
then, on each of these pieces, one-half just goes away because x, y is constant. 

Let's try to use that method in our example. Let's say that I want to go a long this 
path from the origin, first a long the x-axis to (x1, 0) and then vertically to (x1, y1). 
And so I want to compute for the line  integral along that curve. Let's say I want to 
do it for this vector field. I want to find the potentia l for this vector field. Let me copy 
it because I will have to erase at some point. 4x squared plus 8xy and 3y squared 

plus 4x squared. That w ill become the integra l of 4x squared p lus 8 xy times dx p lus 
3y squared plus 4x squared times dy. 

To eva luate on this broken  line, I w ill, of course, eva luate separately on each of the 
two segments. I will start with this segment that I will call c1 and then I will do this 
one that I w ill call c2. On c1, how do I eva luate my integral? Well,  if I am on c1 then 
x varies from zero to x1. Well, actua lly, I don't know if x1 is positive or not so I 
shouldn't write this. I rea lly should say just x goes from zero to x1. And what about 
y? y is just 0. I w ill set y equa l to zero and also dy equa l to zero. I get that the line 
integral on c1 --

Well, a lot of stuff goes away. The entire second term with dy goes away because dy 
is zero. And, in the first term, 8xy goes away because y is zero as well. I just have 
an integral of 4x squared dx from zero to x1. By the way, now you see why I have 
been using an x1 and a y1 for my point and not just x and y. It is to avoid confusion. 
I am using x and y as my integration variab les and x1, y1 as constants that are 
representing the end point of my path. And so, if I integrate this, I should get four-
thirds x1 cubed. That is the first part. Next I need to do the second segment. 

If I am on c2, y goes from zero to y1. And what about x? x is constant equal to x1 so 
dx becomes just zero. It is a constant. If I take the line integral of c2, F dot dr then I 
will get the  integral from zero to y1. The entire first term w ith dx goes away and 
then I have 3y squared p lus 4x1 squared times dy. That integrates to y cubed plus 
4x1 squared y from zero  to y1. Or, if you prefer, that is y1 cubed plus 4x1 squared 
y1. 

Now that we have done both of them we can just add them together, and that will 
give us the formula for the potentia l. F of x1 and y1 is four-thirds x1 cubed plus y1 
cubed p lus 4x1 squared y1 plus a constant. That constant is just the integration 
constant that we had from the beg inning. Now you can drop the subscripts if you 
prefer. You can just say f is four-thirds x cubed plus y cubed plus 4x squared y p lus 
constant. And you can check. If you take the gradient of this, you should get aga in 
this vector field over there. Any questions about this method? Yes? 

No. Well, it depends whether you are just trying to  find one potential or if you are 
trying to find all the possib le potentials. If a problem just says find a potential then 
you don't have to use the constant. This guy without the constant is a va lid potential. 
You just have others. If your neighbor comes to you and say your answer must be 
wrong because I got this p lus 18, well, both answers are correct. By the way. 

Instead of going first a long the x-axis vertica lly, you could do it the other way 
around. Of course, start a long the y-axis and then horizontally. That  is the same 
level of d ifficulty. You just exchange roles of x and y. In some cases, it is actua lly 
even making more sense maybe to go radially, start out from the origin to your end 
point. But usually this setting is easier just because each of these two guys were 
very easy to compute. 

But somehow maybe if you suspect that polar coord inates will be involved somehow 
in the answer then maybe it makes sense to choose d ifferent paths. Maybe a straight 
line is better. Now we have another method to look at which is using anti-
derivatives. The goa l is the same, still to find the potentia l function. And you see that 
find ing the potential is rea lly the multivariable analog of finding the anti-derivative  in 
the one variab le. 

Here we did it basica lly by hand by computing the integral. The other thing you could 
try to say is, wait, I already know how to take anti-derivatives. Let's use that instead 
of computing integrals. And it works but you have to be careful about how you do it. 
Let's see how that works. Let's still do it with the same examp le. We want to solve 
the equations. We want a function such that f sub x is 4x squared plus 8xy and f sub 
y is 3y squared p lus 4x squared. Let's just look at one of these at a time. If we look 
at this one, well, we know how to solve this because it is just telling us we have to 
integrate this w ith respect to x. 

Well, let's call them one and two because I will have to refer to them aga in. Let's 
start w ith equation one and lets integrate w ith respect to x. Well, it tells us that f 
should be, what do I get when I integrate this w ith respect to x, four-thirds x cubed 
plus, when I integrate 8xy, y is just a constant, so I will get 4x squared y. And that 
is not quite the end to it because there is an integration constant. And here, when I 
say there is an integration constant, it just means the extra term does not depend 
on x. That is what it means to be a constant  in this setting. But maybe my constant 
still depends on y so it is not actually a true constant. A constant that depends on y 
is not rea lly a constant. It is actually a function of y. 

The good news that we have is that this function normally depends on x. We have 
made some progress. We have part of the answer and we have simplified the 
problem. If we have anything that looks like this, it w ill satisfy the first condition. 
Now we need to look at the second cond ition. We want f sub y to be that. But we 
know what f is, so let's compute f sub y from this. From this I get f sub y. What do I 
get if I differentiate this with respect to y? Well, I get zero p lus 4x squared plus the 
derivative of g. 

I would like to match this with what I had. If I match this w ith equation two then 
that will tell me what the derivative of g should be. If we compare the two things 
there, we get 4x squared p lus g prime of y should be equal to 3y squared by 4x 
squared. And, of course, the 4x squares go away. That tells you g prime is 3y 
squared. And that integrates to y cubed p lus constant. Now, this time the constant is 
a true constant because g d id not depend on anything other than y. And the constant 
does not depend on y so it is a  rea l constant now. Now we just plug this back into 
this guy. Let's call him star. 

If we p lug this into star, we get f equals four-thirds x cubed plus 4x squared y p lus y 
cubed p lus constant. I mean, of course, aga in, now this constant is optional. The 
advantage of this method is you don't have to write any integrals. The sma ll 
drawback is you have to follow this procedure carefully. By the way, one common 
pitfa ll that is tempting. After you have done this, what is very tempting is to just say, 
well, let's do the same with this guy. Let's integrate this with respect to y. You w ill 
get another expression for f up to a constant that depends on x. And then  let's 
match them. 

Well, the difficulty is matching is actually quite tricky because you don't know in 
advance whether they w ill be the same expression. It could be you could say let's 
just take the terms that are here and missing there and combine the terms, you 
know, take all the terms that appear in either one. That  is actua lly not a good way to 
do it, because if I put sufficiently complicated trig functions in there then you might 
not be ab le to see that two terms are the same. Take an easy one. 

Let's say that here I have one plus tangent square and here I have a secan square 
then you might not actua lly notice that there is a difference. But there is no 
difference. Whatever. Anyway, I am saying do it this way, don't do it any other way 
because there is a risk of making a mistake otherwise. I mean, on the other hand, 
you could start w ith integrating with respect to y and then differentiate and match 
with respect to x. 

But what I am saying is just take one of them,  integrate, get an answer that involves 
a function of the other variable, then differentiate that answer and compare and see 
what you get. By the way, here, of course, after we simplified there were only y's 
here. There were no x's. And that is kind of good news. I mean,  if you had had an x 
here in this expression that would have told you that something is going wrong. 

g is a  function of y only. If you get an x here, maybe you want to go back and check 
whether it is rea lly a gradient field. Yes? Yes, this w ill work with functions of more 
than two variab les. Both methods work w ith more than two variab les. We are going 
to see it in the case where more than two means three. We are going to see that  in 
two or three weeks from now. I mean, basically starting at the end of next week, we 
are going to do  triple integra ls, line integrals in space and so on. 

The format is first we do everything in two variables. Then we w ill do three variables. 
And then what happens with more than three w ill be left to your imagination. Any 
other questions about either of these methods? A quick poll. Who prefers the first 
method? Who prefers the second method? Wow. OK. Anyway, you w ill get to use 
whichever one you want. And I would agree with you, but the second method is 
slightly more effective in that you are writing less stuff. You don't have to set up a ll 
these line integra ls. On the other hand, it does require a little bit more attention. 

Let's move on a bit. Let me start by actua lly doing a small recap. We said we have 
various notions. One is to say that the vector field is a grad ient in a certain region of 
a plane. And we have another notion which is being conservative. It says that the 
line integra l is zero along any closed curve. Actually, let me introduce a new piece of 
notation. To remind ourselves that we are doing it a long a closed curve, very often 
we put just a circle for the integral to tell us this is a curve that closes on itself. It 
ends where it started. I mean it doesn't change anything concerning the definition or 
how you compute it or anything. It just reminds you that you are doing it on a closed 
curve. 

It is actually useful for various physica l app lications. And also, when you state 
theorems in that way, it reminds you,oh.. I need to be on a closed curve to do  it. 
And so we have said these two  things are equivalent. Now we have a third thing 
which is N sub x equa ls M sub y at every point. Just to summarize the d iscussion. We 
have sa id if we have a grad ient field then we have this. And the converse is true  in 
suitable reg ions. We have a converse if F is defined in the entire plane. Or, as we will 
see soon, in a simp ly connected  region. 

I guess some of you cannot see what I am writing here, but it doesn't matter 
because you are not officia lly supposed to know  it yet. That w ill be next week. 
Anyway, I said the fact that Nx equa ls My imp lies that we have a gradient field and is 
only if a vector field is defined in the entire p lane or in a region that is called simply 
connected. And more about that later. Now let me just introduce a quantity that 
probably a lot of you have heard about in physics that measures precisely fa irly 
ought to be conservative. That is called the curl of a vector field. 

For the definition we say that the curl of F is the quantity N sub x - M sub y. It is just 
replicating the information we had but in a way that is a single quantity. In this new 
language, the cond itions that we had over there, this condition says curl F equals 
zero. That is the new version of Nx equals My. It measures failure of a vector field to 
be conservative. The test for conservativeness is that the curl of F should be zero. I 
should probably tell you a little b it about what the curl is, what it measures and what 
it does because that is something that is probab ly useful. It is a very strange 
quantity if you put it in that form. Yes? 

I think it is the same as the physics one, but I haven't checked the physics textbook. 
I believe it is the same. Yes, I think  it is the same as the physics one. It  is not the 
opposite this time. Of course, in physics maybe you have seen curl in space. We are 
going to see curl in space in two or three weeks. Yes? Yes. Well, you can a lso use  it. 
If you fa il this test then you know  for sure that you are not gradient field so you 
might as well do that. If you satisfy the test but you are not defined everywhere then 
there is still a b it of ambiguity and you don't know for sure. OK. 

Let's try to see a little bit what the curl measures. Just to give you some intuition, 
let's first think about a velocity field. The curl measures the rotation component of a 
motion. If you want a  fancy word, it measures the vorticity of a motion. It tells you 
how much tw isting is taking place at a given point. For examp le, if I take a constant 
vector field where my fluid is just a ll moving in the same direction where this is just 
constants then, of course, the curl is zero. 

Because if you take the partials you get zero. And, indeed, that  is not what you 
would call swirling. There  is no vortex in here. Let's do another one where this is still 
nothing going on. Let's say that I take the radial vector field where everything just 
flows away from  the origin. That is f equals x, y. Well, if I take the curl, I have to 
take partia l over partial x of the second component, which is y, minus partial over 
partial y of the first component, which is x. I w ill get zero. And, indeed, if you think 
about what is going on here, there is no rotation involved. On the other hand, if you 
consider our favorite rotation vector field --

-- negative y and x then this curl is going to be N sub x minus M sub y, one plus one 
equa ls two. That corresponds to the fact that we are rotating. Actua lly, we are 
rotating at unit angular speed. The curl actua lly measures twice the angular speed of 
a rotation part of a motion at any given point. Now, if you have an actual motion, a 
more complicated  field than these then no matter where you are you can think of a 
motion as a comb ination of translation effects, maybe dilation effects, maybe 
rotation effects, possib ly other things like that. 

And what a curl will measure is how intense the rotation effect is at that particular 
point. I am not going to try to make a much more precise statement. A precise 
statement  is what a curl measures is really this quantity up there. But the intuition 
you should have is it measures how much rotation is taking place at any given point. 
And, of course, in a comp licated motion you might have more rotation at some point 
than at some others, which is why the curl w ill depend on x and y. It is not just a 
constant because how much you rotate depends on where you are. 

If you are looking at actual wind velocities in weather prediction then the reg ions 
with high curl tend to be hurricanes or tornadoes or things like that. They are not 
very pleasant things. And the sign of a curl tells you whether you are going clockwise 

or counterclockw ise. Curl measures tw ice the angular velocity of the rotation 
component of a velocity field. Now, what about a force field? Because, after a ll, how 
we got to this was coming from and trying to understand forces and the work they 
do. So I should tell you what it means for a force. Well, the curl of a force field --

-- measures the torque exerted on a test object that you put at any point. 
Remember, torque is the rotationa l analog of the force. We had this ana logy about 
velocity versus angular velocity and mass versus moment of inertia. And then, in 
that ana logy, force d ivided by the mass is what will cause acceleration, which is the 
derivative of velocity. Torque divided by moment of inertia is what will cause the 
angular acceleration, namely the derivative of angular velocity. Maybe I should write 
that down. 

Torque divided by moment of inertia is going  to be d over dt of angular velocity. I 
leave it up to your physics teachers to decide what letters to use for all these things. 
That  is the analog of force d ivided by mass equa ls acceleration, which is d over dt of 
velocity. And so now you see if the curl of a velocity field measure the angular 
velocity of its rotation then, by this ana logy, the curl of a force field should measure 
the torque it exerts on a mass per unit moment of inertia. 

Concretely, if you imagine that you are putting something in there, you know, if you 
are in a velocity field the curl will tell you how fast your guy  is spinning at a given 
time. If you put something that floats, for example, in your fluid, something very 
light then it is going to start spinning. And the curl of a velocity field tells you how 
fast it is sp inning at any given time up to a factor of two. And the curl of a force field 
tells you how quickly the angular velocity is going to increase or decrease. OK. 

Well, next time we are going to see Green's theorem which is actually going to  tell us 
a lot more about curl and  failure of conservativeness.
