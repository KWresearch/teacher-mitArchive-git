18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 29 

So, first of all, there is a handout here with some notes on what I'm going to expla in 
today, g iving you a b it more details. So, the goa ls for today  is we're going to see two 
things. One is how to prove the divergence theorem, and the second one is actually 
what it says physically. So, we're going to see how it relates to partia l d ifferential 
equations that come up naturally in physics such as the diffusion equation, the heat 
equation, convection equation, and so on. 

So that's what these notes are about. If you don't have them yet, then you can just 
pick them up at the end of class. And the other thing is, well, my office hour 
tomorrow afternoon is canceled because I won't be around. But, I'm available this 
afternoon after this class if you want. Otherw ise I'll be reachable by e-ma il, and all 
that. OK, so remember we left things w ith this statement of the d ivergence theorem. 
So, the divergence theorem g ives us a way to compute the flux of a vector field for a 
closed surface. OK, it says if I have a closed surface, s, bounding some region, D, 
and I have a vector field defined in space, so that I can try to compute the flux of my 
vector field through my surface. 

Double integra l of F.dS or F.ndS if you want, and to set this up, of course, I need to 
use the geometry of the surface depending on what the surface is. We've seen 
various formulas for how to set up the double integral. But, we've also seen that if 
it's a closed surface, and if a vector field is defined everywhere inside, then we can 
actually reduce that to a ca lculation of the triple integra l of the d ivergence of F 
inside, OK? 

So, concretely, if I use coordinates, let's say that the coord inates of my vector field 
are, sorry, the components are P, Q, and R dot ndS, then that w ill become the triple 
integral of, well, so, divergence is P sub x p lus Q sub y plus R sub z. OK, so by the 
way, how to remember this formula for divergence, and other formulas for other 
things as well. Let me just tell you quickly about the del notation. So, this guy 
usua lly pronounced as del, rather than as pointy triangle going downwards or 
something like that, it's a symbolic notation  for an operator. So, you're probab ly 
going to comp lain about putting these guys into a vector. 

But,  let's think of partia l with respect to x, w ith respect to y, and with respect to z as 
the components of some forma l vector. Of course, it's not a real vector. These are 
not like anything. These are just symbols. But, so see for examp le, the grad ient of 
function, well, if you multiply this vector by scalar, which is a function, then you will 
get partia l, partia l x of f, partia l, partia l y of f, partial, partial z, f, well, that's the 
gradient. 

That seems to work. So now, the interesting thing about divergence is I can think of 
divergence as del dot a vector field. See, if I do the dot product between this guy 
and my vector field P, Q, R, well, it looks like I will indeed get partia l, partia l x of P 
plus partial Q partial y p lus partial R partia l z. That's the divergence. OK, and of 
course, similarly, when we have two variab les only, x and y, we could have thought 

of the same notation, just w ith a two component vector, partia l, partial x, partia l, 
partial y. So, now, this is like of slightly limited usefulness so far. It's going to 
become very handy pretty soon because we are going to see curl. And, the formula 
for curl in the plane was kind of complicated. But, if you thought about it in terms of 
this, it was actua lly the determinant of del and f. And now, in space, we are actually 
going to do del cross f. But, I'm getting ahead of things. 

So, let's not do anything with that. Curl will be for next week. Just getting you used 
to the notation, especia lly since you might be using it in physics already. So, it might 
be worth doing. OK, so the other thing I wanted to say is, what does this theorem 
say physically? How should I think of this statement? So, I think I said that very 
quickly at the end of last time, but not very carefully. 

So, what's the physica l interpretation of a d ivergence field? So, I want to claim that 
the d ivergence of a vector field corresponds to what I'm going to ca ll the source rate, 
which is somehow  the amount of flux generated per unit volume. So, to understand 
what that means, let's think of what's ca lled an incompressib le fluid. OK, so an 
incompressible fluid is something like water, for example, where a fixed mass of it 
always occupies the same amount of volume. So, guesses are compressible. L iquids 
are incompressible, basically. So, if you have an incompressib le fluid flow --

-- well, so, again, what that means is rea lly, given mass occup ies always a fixed 
volume. Then, well, let's say that we have such a fluid w ith velocity g iven by our 
vector field. OK, so we're thinking of F as the velocity and maybe something 
containing water, a pipe, or something. So, what does the divergence theorem say? 
It says that if I take a region in space, let's call it D, sorry, D is the inside, and S is 
the surface around it, well, so if I sum the divergence in D, well, I'm going to get the 
flux going out through this surface, S. I should have mentioned it earlier. The 
convention in the divergence theorem is that we orient the surface w ith a normal 
vector pointing a lways outwards. 

OK, so now, we know what flux means. Remember, we've been describing,  flux 
means how much  fluid is passing  through this surface. So, that's the amount of fluid 
that's leaving the region, D, per unit time. And, of course, when I'm saying that, it 
means I'm counting everything that's going out of D minus everything that's coming 
into D. That's what the flux measures. So, now, if there is stuff coming into D or 
going out of D, well, it must come from somewhere. So, one possibility would be that 
your fluid is actually being compressed or expanded. But, I've sa id, no, I'm looking 
at something like water that you cannot squish  into smaller volume. So, in that case, 
the only explanation is that there is something it here that actua lly is sucking up 
water or producing more water. 

And so, integrating the divergence gives you the total amount of sources minus the 
amount of syncs that are  inside this region. So,  the d ivergence itself measures 
basically the amount of sources or syncs per unit volume in a given place. And now, 
if you think about it that way, well, it's basically the d ivergence theorem is just 
stating something completely obvious about a ll the matter that is  leaving this region 
must come from somewhere. 

So, that's basica lly how we think about it. Now, of course, if you're doing 8.02, then 
you might actually have seen the divergence theorem already being used for things 
that are more like force fields, say, electric fields and so on. Well, I'll try to say a  few 
things about that during the last week of classes. But, then this kind of interpretation 

doesn't quite work. OK, any questions, genera lly speaking, before we move on to the 
proof and other applications? Yes? 

Oh, not the gradient. So, yeah, not the grad ient. So, yeah, the d ivergence of F 
measures the amount of sources or syncs in there. Well, what makes it happen? If 
you want, in a way, it's this theorem. Or, in another way, if you think about it, try to 
look at your favorite vector fields and compute their divergence. And, if you take a 
vector field where maybe everything is rotating, a flow that's just rotating about 
some axis, then you'll find that  its d ivergence is zero. If you, sorry? No, d ivergence is 
not equal to the grad ient. Sorry, there's a dot here that maybe is not very big, but 
it's very important. 

OK, so you take the divergence of a vector field. Well, you take the gradient of a 
function. So, if the gradient of a function is a vector, the d ivergence of a vector field 
is a function. So, somehow  these guys go back and forth between. So, I should have 
said, with new notations comes new responsib ility. I mean, now that we have this 
nice, nifty notation that w ill let us do gradient divergence and later curl in a unified 
way, if you choose this notation you have to be really, really careful what you put 
after it because otherwise it's easy to get comp letely confused. 

OK, so divergence and gradients are completely different things. The only thing they 
have in common is that both are what's called a first order differential operator. That 
means  it involves the first partial derivatives of whatever you put into  it. But, one of 
them goes from  functions to vectors. That's gradient. The other one goes from 
vectors to functions. That's d ivergence. And, curl later w ill go  from vectors to 
vectors. 

But,  that w ill be later. Let's see, more questions? No? OK, so let's see, so how are we 
going to actually prove this theorem? Well, if you remember how we prove Green's 
theorem a while ago, the answer is we're going  to do it exactly the same way. So, if 
you don't remember, then I'm going to explain. OK, so  the first thing we need to do 
is actua lly a simplification. So, instead of proving the divergence theorem, namely, 
the equa lity up there, I'm going to actua lly prove something easier. I'm going to 
prove that the flux of a vector field that has only a z component is actually equal to 
the triple integral of, well, the d ivergence of this is just R sub z dV. 

OK, now, how do I go back to the general case? Well, I will just prove the same thing 
for a vector field that has only an x component or only a y component. And then, I 
will add these things together. So, if you think carefully about what happens when 
you eva luate this, you will have some formula  for ndS, and when you do  the dot 
product, you'll end up w ith the sum, P times something plus Q times something plus 
R times something. And basica lly, we are just dealing with the last term, R times 
something, and show ing that it's equal to what it should be. And then, we the three 
such terms together. We'll get the general case. OK, so then we get the general case 
by summing one such identity for each component. 

I should say three such identities, one for each component, whatever. Now, let's 
make a second simp lification because I'm still not feeling confident I can prove this 
right away for any surface. I'm going to do it first or what's called a vertica lly simp le 
region. OK, so vertica lly simp le means  it will be something which I can setup an 
integral over the z variable first easily. So, it's something that has a bottom face, 
and a top  face, and then some vertica l sides. 

OK, so  let's say first what happens if the g iven region, D, is vertica lly simple. So, 
vertically simple means it looks  like this. It has top. It has a bottom. And, it has 
some vertical sides. So, if you want, if I  look at it from above, it projects to some 
region in the xy plane. Let's call that R. And, it lives between the top face and the 
bottom face. Let's say the top  face is z equa ls z2 of (x, y). Let's say the bottom face 
is z equa ls z1(x, y). 

OK, and I don't need to know actual formulas. I'm just going to work w ith these and 
prove things independently of what the formulas will be for these functions. OK, so 
anyway, a vertica lly simple reg ion is something that lives above a part of the xy 
plane, and is between two graphs of two  functions. So, let's see what we can do in 
that case. So, the right-hand side of this equality, so  that's the triple integra l, let's 
start computing it. 

OK, so of course we will not be able to get a number out of it because we don't 
know, actually,  formulas for anything. But at least we can start simplifying because 
the way this region looks like, I should say this is D, tells me that I can start setting 
up the triple integra l at least in the order where I integrate first over z. OK, so I can 
actually do it as a  triple integra l with Rz dz dxdy or dydx, doesn't matter. So, what 
are the bounds on z? See, this is actua lly good practice to remember how we set up 
triple integra ls. So, remember, when we d id it first over z, we start by fixing a point, 
x and y, and for that value of x and y, we look at a small vertica l slice and see from 
where to where we have to go. 

Well, we start at z equals whatever the va lue is at the bottom, so, z1 of x and y. 
And, we go up to the top  face, z2 of x and y. Now, for x and y, I'm not going to 
actually set up bounds because I've a lready ca lled R the quantity that I'm 
integrating. So let me change this to, let's say, U or something like that. If you 
already have an R, I mean, there's not much risk for confusion, but still. 

OK, so we're going to ca ll U the shadow of my region instead. So, now I want to 
integrate over all values of x and y that are in the shadow of my region. That means 
it's a double integra l over this region, U, which I haven't described to you. So, I can't 
actually set up bounds for x and y. But, I'm going to just leave it like this. OK, now 
you see,  if you look at how you would start evaluating this, well, the inner integral 
certainly is not scary because you're integrating  the derivative of R w ith respect to z, 
integrating that with respect to z. So, you should get R back. OK, so triple integral 
over D of Rz dV becomes, well, we'll have a double integral over U of, so, the inner 
integral becomes R at the point on the top. 

So, that means, remember, R  is a function of x, y, and z. And, in fact, I will plug into 
it the va lue of z at the top, so, z of xy minus the va lue of R at the point on the 
bottom, x, y, z1 of x, y. OK, any questions about this? No? Is it looking vaguely 
believab le? Yeah? OK. So, now, let's compute the other side because here we are 
stuck. We won't be able to do anything else. So, let's look at the flux integral. OK, 
we have to look at the flux of this vector field through the entire surface, S, which is 
the whole boundary of D. 

So, that consists of a lot of pieces, namely the top, bottom, and the sides. OK, so the 
other side -- So, let me just remind you, S is bottom p lus top plus side of this vector 
field, dot ndS equals, OK, so what do we have? So first, we have to look at the 
bottom. No, let's start w ith the top actua lly. Sorry. OK, so let's start with the top. So, 
just remind you,  let's do a ll of them. So, let's look at the top first. So, we need to set 

up the flux integral for a vector field dot ndS. We need to know what ndS is. Well, 
fortunately for us, we know that the top  face is going to be the graph of some 
function of x and y. So, we've seen a formula  for ndS in this kind of situation, OK? 
We have seen that ndS, sorry, so, just to remind you this  is the graph of a  function z 
equa ls z2 of x, y. 

So, we've seen ndS for that is negative partia l derivative of this function w ith respect 
to x, negative partial z2 with respect to y, one, dxdy. OK, and, well, we can't 
compute these guys, but it's not a big deal because if we do the dot product w ith <0, 
0, R> dot ndS, that will give us, well, if you dot this with zero, zero, R, these terms 
go away. You just have R dxdy. So, that means that the double integra l for flux 
through the top of R vector field dot ndS becomes double integra l of the top of R 
dxdy. Now, how do we evaluate that, actually? Well, so R is a function of x, y, z. But 
we sa id, we have only two variab les that we're going to use. We're going to use x 
and y. We're going to get rid of z. How do we get rid of z? Well, if we are on the top 
surface, z is g iven by this formula, z2 of x, y. So, I plug z equals z2 of x, y into the 
formula for R, whatever it may be. 

Then, I integrate dxdy. And, what's the range for x and y? Well, my surface sits 
exactly above this region U in the xy p lane. So, it's double integra l over U, OK? Any 
questions about how I set up this flux integral? No? OK, let me close the door, 
actually. OK, so we've got one of the two terms that we had over there. Let's try to 
get the others. [LAUGHTER] No comment. OK, so, we need to look, also, at the other 
parts of our surface for the flux integral. So, the bottom, well, it w ill work pretty 
much the same way, right, because it's the graph of a function, z equa ls z1 of x, y. 
So, we should be ab le to get ndS using the same method, negative partia l with 
respect to x, negative partia l with respect to y, one dxdy. 

Now, there's a small catch. OK, we have to think of it carefully about orientations. 
So, remember, when we set up the divergence theorem, we need the normal vectors 
to point out of our reg ion, which means that on the top surface, we want n pointing 
up. But, on the bottom face, we want n pointing down. So, in fact, we shouldn't use 
this formula here because that one corresponds to the other orientation. Well, we 
could use it and then subtract, but I was just going to say that ndS  is actua lly the 
opposite of this. So, I'm going to switch all my signs. OK, that's the other side of the 
formula when you orient your graph w ith n pointing downwards. 

Now, if I do  things the same way as before, I w ill get that <0, 0, R> dot ndS will be 
negative R dxdy. And so, when I do the doub le integra l over the bottom, I'm going 
to get the double integral over the bottom of negative R dxdy, which, if I try to 
eva luate that, well, I actua lly will have to integrate. Sorry, first I'll have to substitute 
the value of z. The value of z that I w ill want to plug into R w ill be given by, now, z1 
of x, y. And,  the bounds of integration w ill be given, again, by the shadow of our 
surface, which is, aga in, this guy, U. OK, so we seem to be a ll set, except we are still 
missing one part of our surface, S, because we also need to look at the sides. 

Well, what about the sides? Well, our vector field, <0, 0, R>, is actually vertical. It's 
parallel to the z axis. OK, so my vector field does something like this everywhere. 
And, why that makes it very interesting on the top and bottom, that means that on 
the sides, rea lly not much is going on. No matter is passing through the vertica l 
sides. So, the side -- The sides are vertica l. So, <0, 0, R> is tangent to the side, and 
therefore, the flux through the sides is just going to be zero. 

OK, no ca lculation needed. That's because, of course, that's the reason why a 
simplified  first things so  that my vector field would only have a z component, well, 
not just that but that's the main p lace where it becomes very useful. So, now, if I 
compare my doub le integral and, sorry, my trip le integra l and my flux integral, I get 
that they are, indeed, the same. Well,  that's the statement of the theorem we are 
trying to prove. I shouldn't erase it, OK? [LAUGHTER] 

So, just to recap, we've got a formula for the triple integral of R sub z dV. It's up 
there at the very top. And, we got formulas for the flux through the top and the 
bottom, and the sides. And, when you add them together, you get  indeed the same 
formula, top p lus bottom -- -- plus sides of, OK, and so we have, actually, completed 
the proof for this part. Now, well, that's only for a vertica lly simp le region, OK? So, if 
D is not vertically simple, what do we do? Well, we cut it into vertica lly simple pieces. 

OK so, concretely, I wanted to integrate over a solid doughnut. Then, that's not 
vertically simple because here in the middle, I have not only does top in this bottom, 
but I have this middle face. So, the way I would cut my doughnut would be probably 
I would slice it not in the way that you'd usua lly slice the doughnut or a bagel, but at 
it's probab ly more spectacular if you think that  it's a bagel. Then, a mathematician's 
way of slicing it is like this into five pieces, OK? 

And, that's not very convenient for eating, but that's convenient for integrating over 
it because now each of these pieces has a well-defined top and bottom face, and of 
course you've introduced some vertica l sides for two reasons. One is that we've said 
the flux through them is zero anyway. So, who cares? Why bother? But, also, if you 
sum the flux through the surface of each little piece, well, you will see that you will 
be integrating twice over each of these vertical cuts. 

Once, when you do this p iece, you will be taking the flux through this red guy w ith 
normal vector pointing to the right, and once, when you take this midd le little piece, 
you will be taking the flux through that cut surface aga in, but now with norma l 
vector pointing the other way around. So, in fact, you'll be summing the flux through 
these guys twice w ith opposite orientations. They cancel out. Well, and again, 
because of what you are doing actually, the  integral was just zero anyway. So, it 
didn't matter. But, even if it hadn't simplified, that would do it for us. OK, so that's 
how we do it w ith the genera l region. And then, as I sa id at the beg inning, when we 
can do it for a vector field that has only a z component, well, we can also do it for a 
vector field that has only an x or only a y component. And then, we sum together 
and we get the genera l case. 

So, that's the end of the proof. OK, so you see,  the idea  is really the same as for 
Green's theorem. Yes? Oh, there's only four pieces, thank you. Yes, there's three 
kinds of mathematicians: those who know how to count, and those who don't. Well, 
OK. So, OK, now I hope that you can see already the interest of this theorem for the 
divergence theorem for computing flux integra ls just for the sake of computing flux 
integrals like might happen on the problem set or on the next test. But let me tell 
you also why it's important physically to understand equations that had been 
observed empirica lly well before they were actually understood in terms of how 
things go. So, let's look at something ca lled the diffusion equation. So, let me 
exp lain to you what it does. 

So, the diffusion equation is something that governs, well, what's ca lled d iffusion. 
Diffusion is when you have a fluid in which you are introducing some substance, and 

you want to figure out how that thing is going to spread out, the technica l term is 
diffuse, into the amb ient fluid. So,  for examp le, that governs the motion of, say, 
smoke in the a ir, or if you put dye in the solution or things like that. 

That w ill tell you, say that you drop some ink into a glass of water. Well, you can 
imagine that obviously it will get diluted into there. And, that equation w ill tell you 
how exactly over time this thing is going to spread out and start filling the entire 
glass. So, what's the equation? Well, we need,  first, to know what the unknown w ill 
be. So,  it's a partial differentia l equation, OK? So the unknown is a function, and the 
equation w ill relate the partia l derivatives of that function to each other. So, u, the 
unknown, w ill be the concentration at a g iven point. And, of course, that depends on 
the point where you are. So, that depends on x, y, z, the location where you are. 

But, since the goa l is a lso to understand how things spread over time, it should also 
depend on time. Otherwise, we're not going to get very far. And, in fact, what the 
equation w ill g ive us is the derivative of u with respect to t. It w ill tell us how  the 
concentration at a g iven point varies over time in terms of how the concentration 
varied in space. So, it will relate partia l u partia l t to partial derivatives w ith respect 
to x, y, and z. 

[APPLAUSE] OK, [LAUGHTER] so what's the equation? The equation is partia l u 
partial t equals some constant. Let me call it constant k times something I will ca ll 
del squared u, which is also ca lled the Lap lacian of u, and what is that? Well, that 
means, OK, so just to scare you, del squared is this, which means it's the divergence 
of grad ient u that we've used this notation for gradient. OK, so if you actually expand 
it in terms of variab les, that becomes partial u over partial x squared p lus partial 
squared u over partial y squared plus partia l squared u over partial z squared. OK, so 
the equation is this equals that. 

OK, so  that's a weird looking equation. And, I'm going to have to expla in to you, 
where does it come from? OK, but before I do that, well, let me point out actually 
that the equation is not just the diffusion equation. It's also known as the heat 
equation. And, that's because exactly the same equation governs how temperature 
changes over time when you have, aga in, so, sorry I should have been actua lly more 
careful. 

I should have sa id this is in air that's not moving, OK? OK, and same thing w ith the 
solution. If you drop some ink into your g lass of water, well, if you start stirring, 
obviously it will mix much faster than if you don't do anything. OK, so that's the case 
where we don't actua lly, the fluid is not moving. And, the heat equation now does 
the same, but for temperature in a fluid that's at rest, that's not moving. It tells you 
how the heat goes from the warmest parts to the coldest parts, and eventually 
temperatures should somehow even out. So, in the heat equation, that would just 
be, this u would just measure the temperature for temperature of your fluid at a 
given point. 

Actually, it doesn't have to be a  fluid. It could be a solid for that heat equation. So, 
for examp le, say that you have a b ig box made of meta l or something, and you do 
some heating at one side. You want to know how quickly is the other side going to 
get hot? Well, you can use the equation to  figure out, you know, say that you have a 
metal bar, and you keep one side at 400Â° because it's in your oven. How quickly will 
the other side get warm? 

OK, so  it's the same equation for both phenomena even though they are, of course, 
different phenomena. Well, the physical reason why they're the same is actually that 
phenomena are d ifferent, but not a ll that much. They involve, actua lly, how the 
atoms and molecules are actua lly moving, and hitting each other inside this medium. 
OK, so anyway, what's the explanation for this? So, to understand the explanation, 
and given what we've been doing, we should have a vector field in there. So, I'm 
going to think of the flow of, well,  let's imag ine that we are doing motion of smoke in 
air. So, that's the flow of the smoke: that means at every point, it's a vector whose 
direction tells me in which d irection the smoke is actually moving. 

And, its magnitude tells me how  fast it's moving, and also what amount of smoke is 
moving. So, there's two things to understand. One is how the d isparities in the 
concentration between different points causes the flow to be there, how smoke will 
flow  from the regions where there's more smoke to the regions where there's less 
smoke. And, that's actually physics. But, in a way, it's also common sense. So, 
physics and common sense tell us that the smoke will flow from high concentration 
towards low concentration regions. 

OK, so  if we think of this function, U, that measures concentration, that means we 
are a lways going to go in the d irection where the concentration decreases the 
fastest. Well, what's that? That's negative the gradient. So, F is directed a long minus 
gradient u. Now, how b ig is F going to be? Well, they are, you have to come up w ith 
some intuition  for how the two are related. And, the easiest relation I can think of is 
that they might be just proportional. 

So, the steeper the differences in concentration, the faster the flow w ill be, or the 
more there will be flow. And, if you try to think about it as molecules moving in 
random directions, you w ill see it makes actually complete sense. Anyway, it should 
be part of your physics class, not part of what I'm telling you. So, I'm just going to 
accept that the flow is just proportiona l to the gradient of u. 

So, if you want, the d ifferences between concentrations of different points are very 
sma ll, then the flow will be very gentle. And,  if on the other hand you have huge 
disparities, then things will try to even out faster. OK, so that's the first part. Now, 
we need to understand the second part, which is once we know how flow is going, 
how does that affect the concentration? If smoke is going that way, then it means 
the concentration here should be decreasing. And there, it should be increasing. 

So, that's the relation between F and partial u partial t. At that part is actua lly math, 
namely, the divergence theorem. So, let's try to understand that part more carefully. 
So, let's take a sma ll piece of a small region in space, D, bounded by a surface, S. 
So, I want to figure out what's going on in here. So, let's look at the flux out of D 
through S. Well, we sa id that this flux would be given by double integra l on S of F 
dot n dS. So,  this flux measures how much smoke  is passing through S per unit 
time. That's the amount of smoke through S per unit time. 

But now, how can I compute that d ifferently? Well, I can compute  it just by looking 
at the tota l amount of smoke in this region, and seeing how much it changes. If I'm 
gaining or losing smoke, it means it must be going up there. Well, unless I have a 
smoker in here, but that's not part of the data. So, that should be, sorry, that's the 
same thing as the derivative w ith respect to t of the total amount of smoke in the 
region, which is given by the triple integra l of u. 

If I integrate the concentration of smoke, which means the amount of smoke per 
unit volume over d, I w ill get the tota l amount of smoke in d, except, well, let's see. 
This flux is counted positively if we go out of d. So, actua lly, it's minus the 
derivative. This is the amount of smoke that we are losing per unit time. OK, so now 
we are almost there. Well, let me actua lly -- Because we know yet another way to 
compute this guy using the divergence theorem. Right, so this part here is just 
common sense and thinking about what it means. The divergence theorem tells me 
this is a lso equal to the triple integral, d, of div f dV. So, what I got is that the triple 
integral over d of d iv F dV equals this derivative. 

Well, let's think a b it about this derivative so, see, you are integrating function over 
x, y, and z. And then, you are differentiating w ith respect to t. I claim that you can 
actually sw itch the order in which you do things. So, when we think about it, is, 
here, you are taking the total amount of smoke and then see how that changes over 
time. So, you're taking the derivative of the sum of all the small amounts of smoke 
everywhere. Well, that will be the sum of the derivatives of the amounts of smoke 
inside each little box. 

So, we can actua lly move the derivatives into the integra l. So, let's see, I sa id minus 
d dt of triple integra l over d udV. And, now I'm saying this is the same as the trip le 
integral in d of du dt dv. And the reason why this is going to work is you should think 
of it as d dt of a sum of u of some va lues. You p lug in the values of your points at 
that given time times the small volume. You sum them, and then you take the 
derivative. And now, you see, the derivative of this sum is the sum of the 
derivatives. 

yi, zi, t, so, if you think about what the integral measures, that's actually pretty 
easy. And it's because this variab le here is not the same as the variables on which 
we are integrating. That's why we can do it. OK, so now, if we have this for any 
region, d. So, we have a function of x, y, z, t, and we have another function here. 
And whenever we integrate them anywhere, we get the same answer. Well, that 
must mean they're the same. Just think of what happens if you just take d to be a 
tiny little box. You will get roughly the value of div f at that point times the volume of 
the box. Or, you w ill get roughly the value of du dt at that point times the va lue of a 
little box. So, the values must be the same. Well, let me actually expla in that a tiny 
bit better. 

So, what I get  is that one over, let me divide by the volume of D, sorry. I promise, 
I'm done in a minute. Is the same thing as one over volume D of negative du dt, dV. 
So, that means the average va lue, OK, maybe that's the best way of telling it, the 
average of d iv f in D is equa l to the average of minus partial u partia l t in D. And, 
that's true for any reg ion, D, not just for some regions, but for, really, any reg ion I 
can think of. So, the outcome is that actua lly the d ivergence of f is equa l to minus du 
dt. 

And, that's another way to think about what divergence means. The divergence, we 
said, is how much stuff  is actua lly expand ing,  flowing out. That's how much we're 
losing. And so, now, if you combine this with that, you w ill get that du dt is minus 
divergence f, which is plus K del squared u. OK, so you combine this guy with that 
guy, and you get the diffusion equation. OK, that's the end. Happy Thanksg iving 
break. Try to go to recitation tomorrow if you can so that your TA's are not too 
lonely. And, enjoy the break. See you next week.
