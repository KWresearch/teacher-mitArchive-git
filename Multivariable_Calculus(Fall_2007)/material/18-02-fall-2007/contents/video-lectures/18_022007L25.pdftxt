Transcript â€“ Lecture 25 

So -- OK, so  first of a ll, about the exam, so you have some statistics up there. The 
class median was 84. So, most of you did pretty well. Passing was 65. If you want to 
know  roughly speaking where you stand, I'd say that 90 or above corresponds to an 
A. 80 or above corresponds to a B. 65 or above corresponds to a C. But, again, I 
mean, nothing is set in stone. That depends a lot on how you do on homework, and 
things like that. So, don't take these va lues too seriously. If you got less than 65, 
then you should definitely take and make up, and also if you were absent for some 
reason yesterday. 

So, I have solutions here. If you don't have them yet, and you can just pick them up 
at the end of class. I a lso have spare copies of problem sets, and solutions. But you 
should have got them yesterday. So, all right, so the past few weeks, we've been 
looking at double integra ls and the p lane, line integrals in the p lane, and will we are 
going to do now from now on basically until the end of the term, will be very similar 
stuff, but in space. So, we are going to learn how to do triple integra ls in space, flux 
in space, work in space, d ivergence, curl, all that. 

So, that means, basica lly, if you were rea lly on top of what we've been doing these 
past few weeks, then it will be just the same with one more coord inate. And, you will 
see there are some differences. But, conceptua lly, it's pretty similar. There are a few 
tricky things, though. Now, that a lso means that if there is stuff that you are not 
sure about in the plane, then I encourage you to review the materia l that we've done 
over the past few weeks to make sure that everything in the plane is completely 
clear to you because it w ill be much harder to understand stuff in space if things are 
still shaky  in the plane. OK, so the plan is we're going to basically go through the 
same stuff, but in space. 

So, it shouldn't be surprising that we will start today with trip le integrals. OK, so the 
way triple integrals work is if I give you a function of three variables, x, y, z, and I 
give you some region in space, so, some solid, then I can take the integral over this 
region over function f dV where dV stands for the volume element. OK, so what it 
means  is we will just take every sing le little piece of our solid, take the va lue of f 
there, multip ly by the small volume of each little piece, and sum a ll these things 
together. 

And, so this volume element here, well, for example, if you are doing  the integra l in 
rectangular coord inates, that will become dx dy dz or any permutation of that 
because, of course, we have lots of possib le orders of integration to choose from. So, 
rather than bore you w ith theory and all sorts of comp licated things, let's just do 
examples. And, you w ill see, basica lly, if you understand how to set up iterated 
integrals into variables, that you basically understand how to do them in three 
variables. You just have to be a bit more careful. And, there's one more step. OK, so 
let's take our first triple integral to be on the reg ion. 

So, of course, there's two different things as always. There is the region of 
integration and there's the function we are integrating. Now,  the function we are 
integrating, well, it will come in handy when you actua lly try to evaluate the integra l. 
But, as you can see, probab ly, the new part is really hard to set it up. So, the 
function won't really matter that much  for me. So, in the examples I'll do today, 
functions will be kind of silly. So,  for examp le, let's say that we want to look at the 
region between two paraboloids, one g iven by z = x ^2 y ^2. 

The other is z = 4 - x ^2 - y ^2. And, so, I haven't given you, yet, the function to 
integrate. OK, this is not the function to  integrate. This is what describes the reg ion 
where I will integrate my function. And, let's say that I just want to  find  the volume 
of this region, which is the triple integra l of just one dV. OK, similarly, remember, 
when we try to find the area of the region in the plane, we are just integrating one 
dA. Here we integrate one dV. that w ill give us the volume. Now, I know that you 
can imagine how to actua lly do this one as a double integral. But, the goal of the 
game is to set up the triple integra l. It's not actually to  find the volume. 

So, what does that look like? Well, z = x ^2 y ^2, that's one of our favorite 
paraboloids. That's something that looks like a parabola w ith  its bottom at the origin 
that you spin about the z axis. And, z equa ls four minus x squared minus y squared, 
well, that's a lso a paraboloid. But, this one is pointing down, and when you take x 
equa ls y equa ls zero, you get z equa ls four. So, it starts at four, and it goes down 
like that. OK, so  the solid that we'd like to consider is what's in between in here. So, 
it has a curvy top which is this downward paraboloid, a curvy bottom which is the 
other paraboloid. 

And, what about the sides? Well, do you have any idea what we get here? Yeah, it's 
going to be a circle because entire picture is invariant by rotation about the z axis. 
So, if you look at the picture just, say, in the yz plane, you get this point and that 
point. And, when you rotate everything around the z axis, you will just get a circle 
here. OK, so our goal  is to find the volume of this thing, and there's lots of things I 
could do to simp lify the calculation, or even not do it as a triple integral at all. 

But, I want to actually set it up as a triple integral just to show how we do that. OK, 
so the first thing we need to do  is choose an order of integration. And, here, well, I 
don't know if you can see it yet, but hopefully soon that will be intuitive to you. I 
cla im that I would like to start by  integrating first over z. What's the reason for that? 
Well, the reason is if I g ive you x and y, then you can find quickly, what's the bottom 
and top values of z for that choice of x and y? OK, so if I have x and y g iven, then I 
can find above that: what is the bottom z and the top z corresponding to the vertical 
line above that point? The portion of it that's inside our solid, so somehow, there's a 
bottom z and a top z. 

And, so the top z is actually on the downward paraboloid. So, it's four minus x 
squared minus y squared. The bottom value of z is x squared plus y squared. OK, so 
if I want to start to set this up, I will write the triple integral. And then, so  let's say 
I'm going to do it dz first, and then, say, dy dx. It doesn't really matter. So then, for 
a given va lue of x and y, I cla im z goes from the bottom surface. The bottom  face is 
z equals x squared plus y squared. The top face is four minus x squared minus y 
squared. OK, is that OK with everyone? Yeah? 

Any questions so far? Yes? Why did I start with z? That's a very good question. So, I 
can choose whatever order I want, but let's say I d id x first . Then, to find the inner 

integral bounds, I would need to say, OK, I've chosen values of, see, in the inner 
integral, you've fixed the two other variables, and you're just going to vary that one. 
And, you need to find bounds for it. So, if I integrate over x first, I have to solve, 
answer the following question. 

Say I'm given va lues of y and z. What are the bounds for x? So, that would mean 
I'm slicing my solid by  lines that are para llel to the x axis. And, see, it's kind of hard 
to find, what are the va lues of x at the front and at the back? I mean, it's possible, 
but it's easier to actually first look for z at the top and bottom. Yes? dy dx, or dx dy? 
No, it's comp letely at random. I mean, you can see x and y play symmetric roles. 
So, if you look at it, it's reasonably clear that z should be the easiest one to set up 
first for what comes next. xy or yx, it's the same. Yes? Yes,  it will be easier to use 
cylindrica l coordinates. I'll get to that just as soon as I'm done with this one. OK, so 
let's continue a b it with that. And, as you mentioned, actually we don't actually want 
to do it with xy in the end. 

In a few minutes, we w ill actually switch to cylindrical coordinates. But, for now, we 
don't even know what they are. OK, so I've done the inner integral by looking at, you 
know, if I slice by vertical lines, what  is the top? What is the bottom for a given va lue 
of x and y? So, the bounds in the inner integral depend on both the middle and outer 
variables. Next, I need to figure out what va lues of x and y I w ill be interested in. 
And, the answer for that is, well, the values of x and y that I want to look at are all 
those that are in the shade of my region. So, in fact, to set up the middle and outer 
bounds, what I want to do is project my solid. So, my solid looks like this kind of 
thing. 

And, I don't rea lly know how to call it. But, what's interesting now  is I want to look 
at the shadow that it casts in the xy plane. OK, and, of course, that shadow w ill just 
be the disk that's directly below this d isk here that's separating  the two ha lves of the 
solid. And so, now I will want to integrate over, I want to look at a ll the xy's, x and 
y, in the shadow. So, now I'm left w ith, actually, something we've a lready done, 
namely setting up a doub le integra l over x and y. So, if  it helps, here, we don't 
strictly need it, but if it helps,  it could be useful to actually draw a p icture of this 
shadow  in the xy plane. 

So, here it would just look, aga in, like a d isk, and set it up. Now,  the question is, 
how do we find the size of this disk, the size of the shadow? Well, basica lly we have 
to figure out where our two paraboloids intersect. There's nothing else. OK, so, one 
way how to find the shadow in the xy p lane -- -- well, here we actually know the 
answer a priori, but even if we didn't, we could just say, well, our region lives 
wherever the bottom surface is below the top surface, OK, so we want to look at 
things wherever bottom value of z is less than the top value of z, I mean, less or less 
than or equal, that's the same thing. 

So, if the bottom value of z is x squared p lus y squared should be less than four 
minus x squared minus y squared, and if you solve for that, then you w ill get, well, 
so let's move these guys over here. You'll get two x squared p lus two y squared less 
than four. That becomes x squared plus y squared less than two. So, that means 
that's a d isk of rad ius square root of two, OK? So, we kind of knew in advance it was 
going to be a disk, but what we've learned now is that this radius is square root of 
two. 

So, if we want to set up, if we rea lly want to set it up using dy dx  like they started, 
then we can do it because we know, so, for the middle integral, now, we want to fix 
a va lue of x. And, for that fixed va lue of x, we want to figure out the bounds for y. 
Well, the answer is y goes from here to here. What's here? Well, here, y is square 
root of two minus x squared. And, here it's negative square root of two minus x 
squared. 

So, y will go from negative square root of two minus x squared to positive square 
root. And then, x w ill go  from negative root two  to root two. OK, if that's not 
completely clear to you, then I encourage you to go over how we set up double 
integrals again. OK, does that make sense, kind of? Yeah? Well, so, when we set up, 
remember, we are setting up a double integra l, dy dx here. So, when we do it dy dx, 
it means we slice this region of a plane by vertical line segments. So, this middle guy 
would be what used to be the inner integra l. So, in the inner, remember, you fix the 
value of x, and you ask yourself, what is the range of values of y in my reg ion? So, y 
goes from here to here, and what here and here are depends on the va lue of x. 

How? Well, we have to  find the relation between x and y at these points. These 
points are on the circle of rad ius root two. So, if you want this circle maybe I should 
have written, is x squared plus y squared equals two. And, if you solve for y, given x, 
you get plus minus root of two minus x squared, OK? Yes? Is there a way to compute 
this with symmetry? Well, certa inly, yeah, this solid looks sufficiently symmetric, but 
actually you could certainly, if you don't want to do the whole d isk, you could just do 
quarter disks, and multip ly by four. You could even just look at the lower half of the 
solid, and multiply them by two, so, total by eight. 

So, yeah, certainly there's lots of ways to make it slightly easier by using symmetry. 
Now, the most spectacular way to use symmetry here, of course, is to use that we 
have this rotation symmetry and sw itch, actua lly, not do this guy in xy coordinates 
but instead in polar coord inates. So -- So, the smarter thing to do would be to use 
polar coord inates instead of x and y. Of course, we want to keep z. I mean, we are 
very happy w ith z the way it is. But, we'll just change x and y to R cos theta, R sine 
theta, OK, because, well, let's see actually how we would evaluate this guy. 

So, well actually, let's not. It's kind of boring. So, let me just point out one small 
thing here, sorry, before I do that. So, if you start computing the inner integral, OK, 
so let me not do that yet, sorry, so if you try to compute the inner integra l, you'll be 
integrating from x squared plus y squared to  four minus x squared minus y squared 
dz. Well, that w ill integrate to z between these two bounds. So, you will get four 
minus two x squared minus two y squared. Now, when you put that into the 
rema ining ones, you'll get something that's probably not very pleasant of four minus 
two x squared minus two y squared dy dx. 

And here, you see that to evaluate this, you would sw itch to polar coord inates. Oh, 
by the way, so if your initia l instincts had been to, given that you just want the 
volume, you could a lso have found the volume just by doing a doub le integral of the 
height between the top and bottom. Well, you would just have gotten this, right, 
because this is the height between top and bottom. So, it's all the same. It doesn't 
really matter. But with this, of course, we will be ab le to integrate a ll sorts of 
functions, not just one over the solid. So, we will be able to do much more than just 
volumes. OK, so let's see, how do we do it w ith polar coord inates instead? Well, so --

Well, that would become, so let's see. So, I want to keep dz. But then, dx dy or dy 
dx would become r dr d theta. And, if I try to set up the bounds, well, I probab ly 
shouldn't keep this x squared plus y squared around. But, x squared p lus y squared 
is easy in terms of r and theta. That's just r squared. OK, I mean, in general I could 
have something that depends a lso on theta. That's perfectly legitimate. But here, it 
simplifies, and this guy up here, four minus x squared minus y squared becomes four 
minus r squared. 

And now, the integral that we have to do over r and theta, well, we look aga in at the 
shadow. The shadow is still a d isk of radius root two. That hasn't changed. And now, 
we know how to set up this integra l in polar coordinates. r goes from zero to root 
two, and theta goes from zero to two pi. OK, and now it becomes actua lly easier to 
eva luate. OK, so now we have actua lly a name for this because we're doing it in 
space. So, these are ca lled, actua lly, cylindrica l coordinates. So,  in fact, you a lready 
knew about cylindrical coordinates even if you d id not know the name. 

OK, so  the idea of cylindrica l coord inates is that instead of x, y, and z, to locate a 
point  in space, you will use three coordinates. One of them is basically how high  it is 
above the xy plane. So, that w ill be z. And then, you will use polar coord inates for 
the projection of your point on the xy p lane. So, r w ill be the distance from the z 
axis. And theta will be the angle from the x axis counterclockwise. So, the one thing 
to be careful about is because of the usual convention, that we make the x axis point 
toward us. Theta equa ls zero is no longer to the right. Now,  theta equals zero  is to 
the front, and the angel is measured from the front counterclockw ise. 

OK, so, and of course, if you want to know how to convert between x, y, z and r 
theta z, well, the formulas are just the same as  in usual polar coord inates. R cos 
theta, r sine theta, and z remain z. OK, so why are these called cylindrical 
coordinates, by the way? Well, let's say that I gave you the equation r equa ls a, 
where a is some constant. Say r equa ls one, for example. So, r equa ls one in 2D, 
that used to be just a circle of rad ius one. Now,  in space, a single equation actua lly 
defines a surface, not just a curve anymore. And, the set of points where r is a, well, 
that's all the points that are d istance a from the z axis. So, in fact, what you get this 
way is a cylinder of radius a centered on the z axis. 

OK, so  that's why they are ca lled cylindrica l coordinates. By the way, so now, 
similarly, if you look at the equation theta equals some g iven value, well, so that 
used to be just a ray from the origin. Now, that becomes a vertical ha lf p lane. For 
example, if I set the va lue of theta and let r and z vary, well, r is always positive, but 
basically that means I am taking a vertica l p lane that comes out in this direction. 

OK, any questions about cylindrical coord inates? Yes? Yeah, so I'm saying when you 
fix theta, you get only a ha lf p lane, not a  full p lane. I mean, it goes all the way up 
and down, but it doesn't go back to the other side of the z axis. Why? That's because 
r is a lways positive by convention. So, for example, here, we say theta is zero. At 
the back, we say theta is p i. We don't say theta  is zero and r is negative. We say r is 
positive and theta is pi. It's a convention, largely. But, sticking with this convention 
really will help you to set up the  integrals properly. I mean, otherw ise there is just 
too much risk for mistakes. Yes? 

Well, so the question is if I were to use symmetry to do this one, would I multip ly by 
four or by two? Well, it depends on how much symmetry you are using. So, I mean, 
it's your choice. You can multiply by two, by four, by eight depend ing on how much 

you cut  it. So, it depends on what symmetry you use, if you use symmetry between 
top and bottom you'd say, well, the volume is twice the lower ha lf. If you use the left 
and right half, you would say it's tw ice each half. If you cut it into four pieces, and so 
on. 

So, and again, you don't have to use the symmetry. If you don't think of using polar 
coordinates, then it can save you from doing, you know, you can just start at zero 
here and here, and simplify things a tiny b it. But, OK, yes? So, to define a vertical 
full plane, well, first of all it depends on whether it passes through the z axis or not. 
If it doesn't, then you'd have to remember how you do in polar coord inates. I mean, 
basically the answer is, if you have a vertica l p lane, so, it doesn't depend on z. The 
equation does not involve z. It only involves r and theta. And, how it involves r and 
theta is exactly the same as when you do a line  in polar coordinates in the plane. So, 
if it's a line passing through the orig in, you say, well, theta is either some value or 
the other one. 

If it's a line that doesn't passes to the orig in, but it's more tricky. But hopefully 
you've seen how to do that. OK, let's move on a bit. So, one thing to know, I mean, 
basically, the important thing to remember is that the volume element in cylindrical 
coordinates, well, dx dy dz becomes r dr d theta dz. And, that shouldn't be surprising 
because that's just dx dy becomes r dr d theta. And, dz rema ins dz. I mean, so, the 
way to think about it, if you want, is that if you take a little piece of solid in space, so 
it has some height, delta z, and it has a base which has some area delta A, then the 
sma ll volume, delta v, is equa l to the area of a base times the height. 

So, now, when you make the things  infinitely small, you w ill get dV  is dA times dz, 
and you can use whichever formula you want for area in the xy p lane. OK, now in 
practice, you choose which order you integrate in. As you have probab ly seen, a 
favorite of mine is z first because very often you'll know what the top and bottom of 
your solid look like, and then you w ill reduce to  just something in the xy plane. 

But,  there might be situations where it's actually easier to start first with dx dy or r 
dr d theta, and then save dz for last. I mean, if you seen how to, in sing le variable 
calculus, the disk and shell methods for finding volumes, that's exactly the dilemma 
of shells versus d isks. One of them is you do z first. The other is you do z last. OK, 
so what are things we can do now with trip le integrals? Well, we can  find  the volume 
of solids by just integrating dV. And, we've seen that. We can  find  the mass of a 
solid. OK, so if we have a density, delta, which, remember, delta  is basically the 
mass divided by the volume. 

OK, so  the small mass element, maybe I should have written that as dm, the mass 
element, is density times dV. So now, this is the rea l physica l density. If you are 
given a material, usua lly, the density will be in grams per cubic meter or cub ic inch, 
or whatever. I mean, there is tons of different units. But, so then, the mass of your 
solid will be just the trip le  integral of density, dV because you just sum the mass of 
each little p iece. And, of course, if the density is one, then it just becomes the 
volume. OK, now, it shouldn't be surprising to you that we can a lso do classics that 
we had seen in the plane such as the average value of a function, the center of 
mass, and moment of inertia. 

OK, so  the average value of the function  f of x, y, z in the reg ion, r, that would be f 
bar, would be one over the volume of the reg ion times the triple integral of f dV. Or, 
if we have a density, and we want to take a weighted average -- Then we take one 

over the mass where the mass is the triple integral of the density times the triple 
integral of f density dV. So, as particular cases, there is, again, the notion of center 
of mass of the solid. So, that's the point that somehow  right in the middle of the 
solid. That's the point mass by which there is a point at which you should put point 
mass so that  it would be equivalent from the point of view of dealing with forces and 
translation effects, of course, not for rotation. But, so the center of mass of a solid is 
just g iven by taking  the average values of x, y, and z. 

OK, so  there is a special case where, so, x bar is one over the mass times triple 
integral of x density dV. And, same thing with y and z. And, of course, very often, 
you can use symmetry to not have to compute all three of them. For example, if you 
look at this solid that we had, well, I guess I've erased it now. But, if you remember 
what it looked, well, it was pretty obvious that the center of mass would be in the z 
axis. So, no need to waste time considering x bar and y bar. 

And, in  fact, you can a lso find z bar by symmetry between the top and bottom, and 
let you figure that out. Of course, symmetry only works, I should say, symmetry 
only works if the density is a lso symmetric. If I had taken my guy to be heavier at 
the front than at the back, then it would no longer be true that x bar would be zero. 
OK, next on the list is moment of inertia. Actua lly, in a way, moment of inertia in 3D 
is easier conceptually than in 2D. So, why is that? Well, because now the various 
flavors that we had come together in a nice way. So, the moment of inertia of an 
axis, sorry, with respect to an axis would be, again, given by the triple integra l of the 
distance to the axis squared times density, times dV. 

And, in particular, we have our solid. And, we might skewer it using any of the 
coordinate axes and then try to rotate it about one of the axes. So, we have three 
different possibilities, of course, the x, y, or z axis. And, so now, rotating about the z 
axis actually corresponds to when we were just doing things for flat ob jects in the xy 
plane. That corresponded to rotating about the orig in. So, secretly, we were saying 
we were rotating about the point. But actually, it was just rotating about the z axis. 
Just I d idn't want to  introduce the z coordinate that we didn't actua lly need at the 
time. So --

[APPLAUSE] OK, so moment of inertia about the z axis, so, what's the d istance to the 
z axis? Well, we've sa id that's exactly r. That's the cylindrica l coord inate, r. So, the 
square of a distance is just r squared. Now, if you didn't want to do it in cylindrica l 
coordinates then, of course, r squared is just x squared plus y squared. Square of 
distance from the z axis is just x squared plus y squared. Similarly, now, if you want 
the d istance from the x axis, well, that will be y squared p lus z squared. 

OK, try to convince yourselves of the picture, or else just argue by symmetry: you 
know, if you change the positions of the axis. So, moment of inertia about the x axis 
is the double integra l of y squared p lus z squared delta dV. And moment of inertia 
about the y axis is the same thing, but now with x squared p lus z squared. And so, 
now, if you try to apply these things for flat solids that are in the xy plane, so where 
there's no z to look at, well, you see these formulas become the old formulas that we 
had. 

But now, they a ll fit together in a more symmetric way. OK, any questions about 
that? No? OK, so these are just formulas to remember. So, OK, let's do an example. 
Was there a question that I missed? No? OK, so  let's find the moment of inertia 
about the z axis of a solid cone -- -- between z equa ls a times r and z equa ls b. So, 

just to convince you that it's a cone, so, z equa ls a times r means the height is 
proportional to the d istance from the z axis. So,  let's look at what we get if we just 
do it in the plane of a blackboard. So, if I go to the right here, r is just the distance 
from the x axis. 

The height should be proportiona l w ith proportionality factor A. So, that means I 
take a line with slope A. If I'm on the left, well, it's the same story except d istance to 
the z axis is still positive. So, I get the symmetric thing. And, in fact, it doesn't 
matter which vertical p lane I do it in. This is the same if I rotate about. See, there's 
no theta in here. So, it's the same in a ll directions. So, I claim it's a cone where the 
slope of the rays is A. 

OK, and z equa ls b. Well, that just means we stop in our horizonta l p lane at height b. 
OK, so  that's solid cone really just looks like this. That's our solid. OK, so it has a flat 
top, that circular top, and then the point is at v. The tip of it is at the origin. So, let's 
try to compute its moment of inertia about the z axis. So, that means maybe this is 
like the top that you are going to sp in. And, it tells you how hard it is to actua lly sp in 
that top. Actua lly, that's a lso useful if you're going to do mechanica l eng ineering 
because if you are trying to design gears, and things  like that that will rotate, you 
might want to know exactly how much effort you'll have to put to actua lly get them 
to spin, and whether you're actua lly going to have a strong enough engine, or 
whatever, to do it. 

OK, so what's the moment of inertia of this guy? Well, that's the triple integral of, 
well, we have to choose x squared p lus y squared or r squared. Let's see, I think I 
want to use cylindrical coordinates to do that, given the shape. So, we use r 
squared. I might have a density that let's say the density is one. So, I don't have 
density. I still have dV. Now, it will be my choice to choose between doing the dz 
first or doing  r dr d theta  first. Just to show you how it goes the other way around, 
let me do it r dr d  theta dz this time. Then you can decide on a case-by-case basis 
which one you like best. OK, so if we do it  in this d irection, it means that in the inner 
and middle integrals, we've fixed a va lue of z. 

And, for that particular value of z, we'll be actua lly slicing our solid by a horizonta l 
plane, and looking at what we get, OK? So, what does that look like? Well, I fixed a 
value of z, and I slice my solid by a horizonta l p lane. Well, I'm going to get a circle 
certainly. What's the radius, well, a d isk actua lly, what's the rad ius of the d isk? Yeah, 
the radius of the disk should be z over a because the equation of that cone, we said 
it's z equa ls ar. So, if you flip it around, so, maybe I should sw itch to another 
blackboard. So,  the equation of a cone is z equa ls ar, or equiva lently r equals z over 
a. 

So, for a given va lue of z, I will get, this guy w ill be a disk of radius z over a. OK, so, 
moment of inertia is going to be, well, we sa id r squared, r dr d theta dz. Now, so, to 
set up the inner and middle integrals, I just set up a doub le  integral over this disk of 
radius z over a. So, it's easy. r goes from zero to z over a. Theta goes from zero  to 
2pi. OK, and then, well, if I set up the bounds for z, now it's my outer variable. So, 
the question I have to ask is what is the first slice? What is the last slice? So,  the 
bottommost va lue of z would be zero, and the topmost would be b. 

And so, that's it I get. So, exercise, it's not very hard. Try to set it up the other way 
around with dz first and then r dr d theta. It's pretty much the same level of 
difficulty. I'm sure you can do both of them. So, and also, if you want to practice 

calculations, you should end up getting p i b to  the five over 10a to the four if I got it 
right. OK, let me finish w ith one more examp le. I'm trying to g ive you plenty of 
practice because in case you haven't noticed, Monday is a holiday. So, you don't 
have recitation on Monday, which is good. But it means that there will be lots of stuff 
to cover on Wednesday. So --

Thank you. OK, so third example, let's say that I want to just set up a trip le integral 
for the reg ion where z is bigger than one minus y inside the unit ba ll centered at the 
orig in. So, the unit ball is just, you know, well, stay inside of the unit sphere. So, its 
equation, if you want, would be x squared plus y squared plus z squared less than 
one. OK, so that's one thing you should  remember. The equation of a sphere 
centered at the orig in is x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals rad ius 
squared. And now, we are going to take this p lane, z equals one minus y. 

So, if you think about it, it's parallel to the x axis because there's no x in its 
coordinate in  its equation. At the origin, the height is one. So, it starts right here at 
one. And, it slopes down w ith y with slope one. OK, so  it's a p lane that comes 
straight out here, and it intersects the sphere, so here and here, but a lso at other 
points in between. Any idea what kind of shape this is? Well, it's an ellipse, but it's 
even more than that. It's also a circle. If you slice a sphere by a p lane, you a lways 
get a circle. But, of course, it's a slanted circle. So, if you look at it  in the xy plane,  if 
you project it to the xy plane, that you w ill get an ellipse. OK, so we want to look at 
this guy in here. 

So, how do we do that? Well, so maybe I should actua lly draw quickly a p icture. So, 
in the yz plane, it looks just like this, OK? But,  if I look at it from above in the xy 
plane, then its shadow, well, see,  it will sit entirely where y is positive. So, it sits 
entirely above here, and it goes through here and here. And, in fact, when you 
project that slanted circle, now you w ill get an ellipse. 

And, well, I don't really know how to draw it well, but it should be something like 
this. OK, so now if you want to try to set up that doub le  integral, sorry,  the triple 
integral, well, so let's say we do it in rectangular coordinates because we are really 
evil. [LAUGHTER] So then, the bottom surface, OK, so we do it w ith z first. So, the 
bottom surface is the slanted plane. So, the bottom va lue would be z equa ls one 
minus y. The top value is on the sphere. So, the sphere corresponds to z equals 
square root of one minus x squared minus y squared. So, you'd go  from the plane to 
the sphere. And then, to  find the bounds for x and y, you have to figure out what 
exactly, what the heck is this reg ion here? 

So, what  is this region? Well, we have to figure out,  for what va lues of x and y the 
plane is below the ellipse. So, the condition is that, sorry, the p lane is below the 
sphere. OK, so, that's when the plane is below the sphere. That means one minus y 
is less than square root of one minus x squared minus y squared. So, you have to 
somehow manipulate this to extract something simpler. Well, probab ly the only way 
to do it is to square both sides, one minus y squared should be less than one minus 
x squared minus y squared. And, if you work hard enough, you'll find quite an ug ly 
equation. But, you can figure out what are, then, the bounds for x given y, and then 
set up the integral? So, just to give you a hint, the bounds on y will be zero to one. 

The bounds on x, well, I'm not sure you want to see them, but in case you do, it will 
be from negative square root of 2y minus 2y squared to square root of 2y minus 2y 
squared. So, exercise, figure out how I got these by starting from that. Now, of 

course, if we just wanted the volume of this guy, we wouldn't do it this way. We do 
symmetry, and actua lly we'd rotate the thing so that our spherica l cap was actually 
centered on the z axis because that would be a much easier way to set it up. But, 
depending on what function we are  integrating, we can't always do that. 

OK, so have a nice, long weekend, and I'll see you on Tuesday.
