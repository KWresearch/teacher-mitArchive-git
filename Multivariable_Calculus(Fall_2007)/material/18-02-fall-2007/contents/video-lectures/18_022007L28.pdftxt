18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 28 

Let's get going. Yesterday we learned about flux and we have seen the first few 
examples of how to set up and compute  integrals for a flux of a vector field for a 
surface. Remember the flux of a vector field F through the surface S is defined by 
taking the doub le integral on the surface of F dot n dS where n is the unit normal to 
the surface and dS is the area element on the surface. As we have seen, for various 
surfaces, we have various formulas telling us what the norma l vector is and what the 
area element becomes. For examp le, on spheres we typica lly integrate with respect 
to phi and theta for latitude and long itude ang les. 

On a horizonta l p lane, we would just end up degrading dx, dy and so on. At the end 
of lecture we saw a formula. A lot of you asked me how we got it. Well, we didn't get 
it yet. We are going to  try to exp lain where it comes from and why it works. The 
case we want to look at is if S is the graph of a function, it is given by z equals some 
function in terms of x and y. Our surface  is out here. Z is a function of x and y. And x 
and y w ill range over some domain in the x, y plane, namely the reg ion that is the 
shadow of the surface on the x, y plane. 

I said that we w ill have a formula for n dS which will end up being plus/minus minus 
f sub x, minus f sub y, one dxdy, so that we w ill set up and evaluate the integra l in 
terms of x and y. Every time we see z we will replace it by f of xy, whatever the 
formula for f might be. Actua lly, if we look at a very easy case where this is just a 
horizontal plane, z equals constant, the function is just a constant, well, the partia l 
derivatives become just zero. You get <0, 0, 1> dx, dy. 

That  is what you would expect for a horizontal p lane just from common sense. This is 
more interesting, of course, if a function is more interesting. How do we get that? 
Where does this come from? We need to figure out,  for a sma ll piece of our surface, 
what will be n delta S. Let's say that we take a small rectang le in here corresponding 
to sides delta x and delta y and we look at the p iece of surface that is above that. 
Well, the question we have now is what is the area of this little p iece of surface and 
what is its norma l vector? Observe this little piece up here. If it is small enough, it 
will look like a parallelogram. 

I mean it might be slightly curvy, but roughly it  looks like a para llelogram in space. 
And so we have seen how to find the area of a parallelogram  in space using cross-
product. If we can figure out what are the vectors for this side and that side then 
taking that cross-product and taking the magnitude of the cross-product will give us 
the area. Moreover, the cross-product a lso gives us the normal direction. In fact, the 
cross-product g ives us two in one. 

It gives us the normal direction and the area element. And that is why I said that we 
will have an easy formula  for n dS while n and dS taken separately are more 
complicated because you would have to actually take the length of a direction of this 
guy. Let's carry out this problem. Let's say I am going to look at a small p iece of the 
x, y plane. Here I have delta x, here I have delta y, and I am starting at some point 

(x, y). Now, above that I will have a para llelogram on my surface. This point here, 
the point where I start, I know what it is. It is just (x, y). And, well, z is f(x, y). 

Now what I want to find, actually, is what are these two vectors, let's call them U 
and V, that correspond to moving a b it in the x direction or in the y direction? And 
then U cross V will be, well, in terms of the magnitude of this guy will just be the 
little piece of surface area, delta S. And, in terms of direction, it will be normal to the 
surface. Actually, I w ill get just delta S times my norma l vector. Well, up to sign 
because, depending on whether I do U V or V U, I might get the norma l vector in the 
direction I want or in the opposite d irection. But we w ill take care of that later. Let's 
find U and V. And, in case you have trouble with that small p icture, I have a better 
one here. 

Let's keep it just in case this one gets really too cluttered. It really represents the 
same thing. Let's try to figure out these vectors U and V. Vector U starts at the point 
x, y,  f of x, y and it goes to -- Whereas, its head, well, I will have moved x by delta 
x. So, x p lus delta x and y doesn't change. And, of course, the z coordinate has to 
change. It becomes f of x p lus delta x and y. Now, how does f change if I change x a 
little bit? Well, we have seen that it is given by the partia l derivative f sub x. This is 
approximately equal to f of x, y plus delta x times f sub x at the given point x, y. 

I am not going to add it because the notation is already long enough. That means 
my vector U, well, approximately because I am using this linear approximation, 
<delta x, 0,  f sub x times delta x>. Is that OK w ith everyone? Good. Now, what 
about V? Well, V works the same way so I am not going to do a ll the deta ils. When I 
move from here to here x doesn't change and y changes by delta y. X component 
nothing happens. Y component changes by delta y. What about the z component? 
Well, f changes by f sub y times delta y. That is how f changes if I increase y by 
delta y. 

I have my two sides. Now I can take that cross-product. Well, maybe I will first 
factor something out. See, I can rewrite this as one, zero, f sub x times delta x. And 
this one I will rewrite as zero, one,  f sub y delta y. And so now the cross-product, n 
hat delta S up to sign is going to be U cross V. We will have to do the cross-product, 
and we will have a delta x, delta y coming out. I am just saving myself the trouble of 
writing a lot of delta x's and delta y's, but if you prefer you can just do d irectly this 
cross-product. 

Let's compute this cross-product. Well, the i component is zero minus f sub x. The y 
component is going to be, well, f sub y minus zero but w ith the minus sign in  front of 
everything, so negative f sub y. And the z component will be just one times delta x 
delta y. Does that make sense? Yes. Very good. And so now we shrink this rectangle, 
we shrink delta x and delta y to zero, that is how we get this formula for n dS equals 
negative fx, negative fy, one, dxdy. Well, p lus/minus because it is up to us to choose 
whether we want to take the normal vector point up or down. 

See, if you take this convention then the z component of n dS is positive. That 
corresponds to norma l vector pointing up. If you take the opposite signs then the z 
component w ill be negative. That means your normal vector points down. This one is 
with n pointing up. I mean when I say up, of course it is still perpend icular to the 
surface. If the surface rea lly has a big slope then it is not really going to go all that 
much up, but more up than down. OK. That is how we get the formula. Any 
questions? No. OK. That is a rea lly useful formula. 

You don't rea lly need to remember a ll the deta ils of how we got it, but p lease 
remember that formula. Let's do an examp le, actually. Let's say we want to find the 
flux of the vector field z times k, so it is a vertical vector field, through the portion of 
the paraboloid z equals x^2 y^2 that  lives above the unit disk. What does that 
mean? z = x^2 y^2. We have seen it many times. It is this parabola and is pointing 
up. Above the unit d isk means I don't care about this infinite surface. I w ill actually 
stop when I hit a  radius of one away from the z-axis. And so now  I have my vector 
field which is going to point overall up because, well, it  is z times k. The more z is 
positive, the more your vector field goes up. 

Of course, if z were negative then it would point down, but it w ill live above. Actually, 
a quick opinion poll. What do you think the flux should be? Should it be positive, 
zero, negative or we don't know? I see some I don't know, I see some negative and I 
see some positive. Of course, I d idn't tell you which way I am orienting my 
paraboloid. So far both answers are correct. The only one that is probably not correct 
is zero because, no matter which way you choose to orient it you should get 
something. It is not looking like it w ill be zero. Let's say that I am going to do it w ith 
the norma l pointing upwards. 

Second chance. I see some peop le changing back and forth from one and two. Let's 
draw a p icture. Which one is pointing upwards? Well, let's look at the bottom point. 
The norma l vector pointing up, here we know what it means. It is this guy. If you 
continue to follow your norma l vector, see, they are actua lly pointing up and into the 
paraboloid. And I claim that the answer should be positive because the vector field is 
crossing our paraboliod going upwards, going from the outside out and below to the 
inside and upside. So, in the direction that we are counting positively. 

We will see how it turns out when we do the ca lculation. We have to compute the 
integral for flux. Double integra l over a surface of F dot n dS is going to be -- What 
are we going to do? Well, F we said is <0, 0, z>. What is n dS. Well,  let's use our 
brand new formula. It says negative f sub x, negative f sub y, one, dxdy. What does 
little f in here? It is x^2 y^2. When we are using this formula, we need to know 
what little x stands for. 

It is whatever the formula is for z as a function of x and y. We take x^2 y^2 and we 
take the partia l derivatives with minus signs. We get negative 2x, negative 2y and 
one, dxdy. Well, of course here it didn't rea lly matter because we are going to dot 
them with zero. Actua lly, even if we had made a mistake we somehow wouldn't have 
had to pay the price. But still. We w ill end up w ith double integral on S of z dxdy. 
Now, what do we do w ith that? Well, we have too many things. We have to get rid of 
z. Let's use z equals x^2 y^2 once more. 

That becomes doub le integral of x^2 y^2 dxdy. And here, see, we are using the fact 
that we are only looking at things that are on the surface. It is not like in a triple 
integral. You could never do that because z, x and y are independent. Here they are 
related by the equation of a surface. If I sound  like I am ranting, but I know from 
experience this is where one of the most sticky and tricky points  is. 

OK. How will we actually  integrate that? Well, now that we have just x and y, we 
should figure out what is the range for x and y. Well, the range for x and y is going 
to be the shadow of our reg ion. It is going to be this unit d isk. I can just do that for 
now. And this is finally where I have left the world of surface integra ls to go back to 

a usua l double integra l. And now I have to set  it up. Well, I can do it this way with 
dxdy, but it looks like there is a smarter thing to do. I am going to use polar 
coordinates. In  fact, I am going to say this is double integral of r^2 times r dr d 
theta. I am on the unit disk so r goes zero to one, theta goes zero  to 2pi. And, if you 
do the calculation, you w ill find that this is going to be p i over two. 

Any questions about the example. Yes? How did I get this negative 2x and negative 
2y? I want to use my formula for n dS. My surface is given by the graph of a 
function. It is the graph of a  function x^2 y^2. I will use this formula that is up here. 
I w ill take the function x^2 y^2 and  I w ill take its partia l derivatives. If I take the 
partial of f, so x^2 y^2 w ith respect to x, I get 2x, so I put negative 2x. And then 
the same thing, negative 2y, one, dxdy. Yes? 

Which k hat? Oh, you mean the vector field. It is a different part of the story. 
Whenever you do a surface integra l for flux you have two parts of the story. One is 
the vector field whose flux you are taking. The other one  is the surface for which you 
will be taking  flux. The vector field only comes as this f in the notation, and 
everything else, the bounds in the doub le  integral and  the n dS, all come from the 
surface that we are looking at. Basica lly, in all of this calculation, this is coming from 
f equa ls zk. Everything else comes from the information paraboloid z = x^2 y^2 
above the unit disk. 

In particular, if we wanted to now find the flux of any other vector field for the same 
paraboloid, well, all we would have to do  is just replace this guy by whatever the 
new vector field is. We have learned how to set up flux integra ls for this paraboloid. 
Not that you should  remember this one by heart. I mean there are many paraboloids 
in life and other surfaces, too. It is better to remember the general method. Any 
other questions? No. OK. Let's see more ways of taking flux integrals. But, just to 
reassure you, at this point we have seen the most important ones. 90% of the 
problems that we will be looking at we can do w ith what we have seen so  far in less 
time and this formula. 

Let's look a little bit at a more general situation. Let's say that my surface is so 
complicated that I cannot actua lly express z as a function of x and y, but let's say 
that I know how to parametize  it. I have a parametric equation for my surface. That 
means I can express x, y and z in terms of any two parameter variables that might 
be relevant for me. If you want, this one here is a special case where you can 
parameterize things in terms of x and y as your two variab les. How would you do it 
in the fully general case? In a way, that will answer your question that, I think one of 
you, I forgot, asked yesterday how would I do it in general? Is there a  formula like M 
dx p lus N dy? Well, that is going to be the general formula. And you w ill see that it is 
a little b it too complicated, so the really useful ones are actua lly the specia l ones. 

Let's say that we are given a parametric description -- -- of a surface S. That means 
we can describe S by formulas saying x is some function of two parameter variables. 
I am going to ca ll them u and v. I hope you don't mind. You can call them t1 and t2. 
You can ca ll them whatever you want. One of the basic properties of a surface is 
because I have only two independent d irections to move on. I should be able to 
express x, y and z in terms of two variables. Now, let's say that I know how to do 
that. Or, maybe I should instead think of it in terms of a position vector if it helps 
you. That is just a vector with components <x, y, z>  is given as a function of u and 
v. 

It works like a parametric curve but with two parameters. Now, how would we 
actually set up a  flux integra l on such a surface. Well, because we are locating 
ourselves in terms of u and v, we w ill end up with an integral du dv. We need to 
figure out how to express n dS in terms of du and dv. N dS should be something du 
dv. How do we do that? Well, we can use the same method that we have actua lly 
used over here. Because, if you think for a second, here we used, of course, a 
rectangle in the x, y p lane and we lifted it to a parallelogram and so on. But more 
generally you can think what happens if I change u by delta u keep ing v constant or 
the other way around? 

You will get some sort of mesh grid on your surface and you w ill look at a little 
parallelogram  that is an elementary piece of that mesh and  figure out what is its 
area and norma l vector. Well, that w ill aga in be given by the cross-product of the 
two sides. Let's think a little bit about what happens when I move a little b it on my 
surface. I am taking this grid on my surface given by the u and v directions. 

And, if I take a piece of that correspond ing to small changes delta u and delta v, 
what is going to be going on here? Well, I have to dea l w ith two vectors, one 
corresponding to changing u, the other one correspond ing to chang ing v. If I change 
u, how does my point change? Well, it is g iven by the derivative of this w ith respect 
to u. This vector here I w ill call, so the sides are given by, let me say, partial r over 
partial u times delta u. If you prefer, maybe I should write it as partia l x over partial 
u times delta u. Well, it is just too boring to write. 

And so on. It means if I change u a little b it, keeping v constant, then how x changes 
is, given by partial x over partial u times delta u, same thing with y, same thing w ith 
z, and I am just using vector notation to do it this way. That is the analog of when I 
said delta  r for line integra ls a long a curve, vector delta  r is the velocity vector dr dt 
times delta t. Now, if I look at the other side --

Let me start again. I ran out of space. One side  is partia l r over partial u times delta 
u. And the other one would be partia l r over partial v times delta v. Because that is 
how the position of your point changes  if you just change u or v and not the other 
one. To  find the surface element together w ith a normal vector, I would just take the 
cross-product between these guys. If you prefer, that is the cross-product of partia l r 
over partial u with partia l r over partial v, delta u delta v. And so n dS is this cross-
product times du dv up to sign. 

It depends on which choice I make for my normal vector, of course. That, of course, 
is a slightly confusing equation to think of. A good exercise, if you want to really 
understand what is going on, try this in two good examples to look at. One good 
example to look at is the previous one. What is it? It is when u and v are just x and 
y. The parametric equations are just x equa ls x, y equa ls y and z is f of x, y. You 
should end up with the same formula  that we had over there. And you should see 
why because both of them are given by a cross-product. The other case you can look 
at just to convince yourselves even  further. We don't need to do that because we 
have seen the formula before, but in the case of a sphere we have seen the formula 
for n and for dS separately. 

We know what n dS are in terms of d phi, d theta. Well, you could parametize a 
sphere  in terms of phi and theta. Namely, the formulas would be x equa ls a sine phi 
cosine theta, y equa ls a sign phi sine theta, z equals a cosine phi. The formulas for 
circle coordinates setting Ro equals a . That  is a parametric equation for the sphere. 

And then, if you try to use this formula here, you should end up with the same things 
we have a lready seen for n dS, just with a lot more pain to actually get there 
because cross-product is going to be a bit complicated. But we are seeing all of these 
formulas a ll fitting together. Somehow it is always the same question. We just have 
different angles of attack on this general problem. Questions? 

No. OK. Let's look at yet another last way of finding n dS. And then I promise we will 
switch to something else because I can feel that you are getting a bit overwhelmed 
for a ll these formulas for n dS. What happens very often is we don't actually know 
how to parametize our surface. Maybe we don't know how to solve for z as a function 
of x and y, but our surface is g iven by some equation. And so what that means is 
actually maybe what we know is not really these kinds of formulas, but maybe we 
know a normal vector. 

And I am going to call this one cap ita l N because I don't even need it to be a unit 
vector. You w ill see. It can be a normal vector of any length you want to the 
surfaces. Why would we ever know a norma l vector? Well, for example, if our surface 
is a p lane, a slanted plane given by some equation, ax by cz = d. Well, you know the 
normal vector. It  is <a, b, c>. Of course, you could solve for z and then go back to 
that case, which is why I said that one is very useful. But you can a lso just stay with 
a normal vector. Why else would you know a norma l vector? Well,  let's say that you 
know an equation that is of a form g of x, y, z equals zero. Well, then you know that 
the gradient of g is perpend icular to the level surface. Let me just g ive you two 
examples. 

If you have a plane, ax by cz = d, then the normal vector would just be <a, b, c>. If 
you have a surface S given by an equation, g(x, y, z) = 0, then you can take a 
normal vector to be the grad ient of g. We have seen that the grad ient is 
perpendicular to the level surface. Now, of course, we don't necessarily have to 
follow what is going to come. Because, if we could solve for z, then we might be 
better off doing what we did over there. But let's say that we want to do it this. What 
can we do? Well, I am going to give you another way to think geometrically about n 
dS. 

Let's start by thinking about the slanted plane. Let's say that my surface is just a 
slanted p lane. My norma l vector would be maybe somewhere here. And let's say that 
I am going to try -- I need to get some handle on how to set up my  integrals, so 
maybe I am going to express things in terms of x and y. I have my coord inates, and 
I w ill try to use x and y. Then I would like to relate delta S or dS to the area in the x 
y p lane. That means I want maybe to look at the projection of this guy onto a 
horizontal plane. 

Let's squish  it horizonta lly. Then you have here another area. The guy on the slanted 
plane, let's ca ll that delta S. And let's call this guy down here delta A. And delta A 
would become ultimately maybe delta x, delta y or something like that. The question 
is how do we find the conversion rate between these two areas? I mean they are not 
the same. Visua lly, I hope it is clear to you that  if my plane is actua lly horizonta l 
then, of course, they are the same. But the more slanted it becomes the more delta 
A becomes smaller than delta S. If you buy land and it  is on the side of a cliff, well, 
whether you look at it on a map or whether you look at it on the actual cliff, the area 
is going to be very different. 

I am not sure if that is a wise thing to do if you want to build a house there, but I bet 
you can get rea lly cheap land. Anyway, delta S versus delta A depends on how 
slanted things are. And  let's try to make that more precise by looking at the angel 
that our plane makes with the horizontal direction. Let's ca ll this angle a lpha, the 
angle that our p lane makes with the horizontal direction. See, it is a ll coming 
together. The first unit about cross-products, norma l vectors and so on is actually 
useful now. 

I cla im that the surface element is related to the area in the plane by delta A equals 
delta S times the cosine of alpha. Why is that? Well, let's look at this sma ll rectangle 
with one horizontal side and one slanted side. When you project this side does not 
change, but this side gets shortened by a  factor of cosine alpha. Whatever this 
length was, this length here is that one times cosine alpha. 

That  is why the area gets shrunk by cosine alpha. In one d irection nothing happens. 
In the other direction you squish by cosine a lpha. What that means is that, well, we 
will have to deal with this. And, of course, the one we w ill care about actually is delta 
S expressed in terms of delta A. But what are we going  to do w ith this cosine? It  is 
not very convenient to have a cosine left in here. Remember, the ang le between two 
planes is the same thing as the angle between the normal vectors. If you want to see 
this angle alpha elsewhere, what you can do is you can just take the vertica l 
direction. Let's take k. Then here we have our angle a lpha again. 

In particular, cosine of alpha, I can get, well, we know how to find the angle between 
two vectors. If we have our normal vector N, we will do N dot k, and we will divide 
by length N, length k. Well, length k is one. That is one easy guy. That is how we 
find the angle. Now I am going to say, well, delta S is going to be one over cosine 
alpha delta A. And I can rewrite that as length of N divided by N dot k times delta A. 

Now, let's multiply that by the unit normal vector. Because what we are about is not 
so much dS but actua lly n dS. N delta S will be, I am just going to multiply by N. 
Well, let's think for a second. What happens if I take a unit norma l N and I multiply it 
by the length of my other norma l b ig N? Well, I get big N again. This is a norma l 
vector of the same length as N, well, up to sign. The only thing I don't know is 
whether this guy will be going in the same direction as big N or in the opposite 
direction. Say that, for examp le, my capital N has, I don't know, length three for 
example. Then the norma l unit vector might be this guy, in which case indeed three 
times little n w ill be big n. 

Or it might be this one  in which case three times little n will be negative big N. But 
up to sign it is N. And  then I will have N over N dot k delta A. And so the final 
formula, the one that we care about in case you don't rea lly like my explanations of 
how we get there, is that N dS is plus or minus N over N dot k dx dy. That one is 
actually kind of useful so let's box it. Now, just  in case you are wondering, of course, 
if you didn't want to project to x, y, you would have maybe preferred to project to 
say the p lane of a blackboard, y, z, well, you can do the same thing. To express n dS 
in terms of dy dz you do the same argument. 

Simp ly, the only thing that changes, instead of using the vertical vector k, you use 
the norma l vector i. So you would be doing N over N dot i dy dz. The same thing. So 
just keep an open mind that this also works w ith other variab les. Anyway, that is 
how you can basically project the vectors of this area element onto the x, y plane in 

a way. Let's look at the specia l case just to see how this fits with stuff we have seen 
before. 

Let's do a specia l examp le where our surface is given by the equation z minus f of x, 
y equa ls zero. That is a strange way to write the equation. z equals f of x, y. That we 
saw before. But now it looks like some function of x, y, z equa ls zero. Let's try to use 
this new method. Let's ca ll this guy g(x, y, z). Well, now let's look at the normal 
vector. The normal vector would be the grad ient of g, you see. What is the grad ient 
of this function? The grad ient of g --

Well, partia l g, partial x, that is just negative partial f, partial x. The y component, 
partial g, partia l y is going to be negative f sub y, and g sub z is just one. Now,  if you 
take N over N dot k dx dy, well, it looks like it is going to be negative f sub x, 
negative f sub y, one divided by -- Well, what is N dot k? If you dot that w ith k you 
will get just one, so I am not going to write it, dx dy. See, that is aga in our favorite 
formula. This one is actua lly more general because you don't need to solve for z, but 
if you cannot solve for z then it is the same as before. 

I think that is enough formulas for n dS. After spend ing a lot of time telling you how 
to compute surface integrals, now I am going to try to tell you how to avoid 
computing them. And that is ca lled the divergence theorem. And we will see the 
proof and everything and app lications on Tuesday, but I want to at least the theorem 
and see how it works in one example. It is also known as the Gauss-Green theorem 
or just the Gauss theorem, depending in who you ta lk to. 

The Green here is the same Green as in Green's theorem, because somehow that is 
a space version of Green's theorem. What does it say? It is 3D analog of Green for 
flux. What it says is if S is a closed surface -- Remember, it is the same as with 
Green's theorem, we need to have something that is comp letely enclosed. You have 
a surface and there is somehow no gaps in it. There is no boundary to it. It  is really 
completely enclosing a  region in space that I will ca ll D. 

And I need to choose my orientation. The orientation that w ill work for this theorem 
is choosing the normal vector to point outwards. N needs to be outwards. That is one 
part of the puzzle. The other part is a vector field. I need to have a vector field that 
is defined and d ifferentiable -- -- everywhere in D, so same instructions as usual. 
Then I don't have actually to compute the flux  integra l. Doub le integral of f dot n dS 
of a closed surface S. 

I am going to put a circle just to remind you it is has got to be a closed surface. It  is 
just a notation to remind us closed surface. I can replace that by the trip le integral of 
a reg ion inside of divergence of F dV. Now, I need to tell you what the d ivergence of 
a 3D vector field is. Well, you will see that it is not much harder than  in the 2D case. 
What you do is just -- Say that your vector field has components P, Q and R. Then 
you will take P sub x Q sub y R sub z. That is the definition. It is pretty easy to 
remember. You take the x component partial respect to S plus partia l respect to y 
over y component plus partial respect to z of the z component. 

For example, last time we saw that the flux of the vector field zk through a sphere of 
radius a was four-thirds p i a cubed by computing the surface integra l. Well, if we do 
it more efficiently now by Green's theorem, we are going to use Green's theorem  for 
this sphere because we are doing the whole sphere. It is fine. It is a closed surface. 
We couldn't do it for, say, the hemisphere or something like that. Well, for a 

hemisphere we would need to add maybe the flat face of a bottom or something like 
that. 

Green's theorem says that our flux integra l can actually be replaced by the trip le 
integral over the solid bow l of radius a of the d ivergence of zk dV. But now what is 
the d ivergence of this field? Well, you have zero, zero, z so you get zero plus zero 
plus one. It looks like it will be one. If you do the triple integral of 1dV, you w ill get 
just the volume -- -- of the region inside, which  is four-thirds by a cubed. And so it 
was no accident. In fact, before that we looked at a lso xi yj zk and we found three 
times the volume. 

That  is because the d ivergence of that field was actually three. Very quickly, let me 
just say what this means physically. Physically, see,  this guy on the left is the total 
amount of stuff that goes out of the region per unit time. I want to figure out how 
much stuff comes out of there. What does the d ivergence mean? The d ivergence 
means  it measures how much the flow is expanding things. It measures how much, I 
said that probably when we were trying to understand 2D d ivergence. 

It measures the amount of sources or sinks that you have  inside your fluid. Now it 
becomes commonsense. If you take a region of space, the tota l amount of water that 
flows out of  it is the total amount of sources that you have in there minus the sinks. 
I mean, in spite of this commonsense exp lanation, we are going to see how to prove 
this. And we will see how  it works and what it says.
