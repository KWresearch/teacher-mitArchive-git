Transcript â€“ Lecture 15 

OK. Let's start. To start w ith, I would like to welcome the parents who are here to 
see how their kids are being tortured by us evil MIT Profs. And, I guess, well, a good 
example of how we torture your kids is we have exams all the time. One of them is 
on Tuesday. I hope still that you w ill have time to spend w ith them during the 
weekend. Tell them to work hard on Monday and enjoy the weekend before it. 
Anyway, on Tuesday there is a second exam. And it  is in Walker or here, depending 
on your last name, same as last time. There are still two practice exams. We are 
going to go over one of them today. The other one you will go over in recitation on 
Monday. 

There used to be spare cop ies. There still are a  few spare cop ies of practice 2A. 
Otherw ise, you can find it on the Web. Let me start by basically  listing the ma in 
things we have learned over the past three weeks or so. And I w ill add a few 
complements of information about that because there are a few sma ll details that I 
didn't quite clarify and that I should probably make a bit clearer, especially what 
happened at the very end of yesterday's class. 

Here is a list of things that should be on your review sheet for the exam. The first 
thing we learned about, the ma in top ic of this unit is about functions of several 
variables. We have learned how to think of functions of two or three variables in 
terms of p lotting them. In particular, well, not only the graph but a lso the contour 
plot and how  to read a contour p lot. And we have learned how to study variations of 
these functions using partial derivatives. 

Remember, we have defined the partial of f with respect to some variable, say, x to 
be the rate of change with respect to x when we hold a ll the other variab les 
constant. If you have a  function of x and y, this symbol means you d ifferentiate with 
respect to x treating y as a constant. And we have  learned how to package partia l 
derivatives into a vector,the gradient vector. For example, if we have a  function of 
three variables, the vector whose components are the partia l derivatives. And we 
have seen how to use the grad ient vector or the partia l derivatives to derive various 
things such as approximation formulas. 

The change in f, when we change x, y, z slightly, is approximately equa l to, well, 
there are several terms. And I can rewrite this in vector form as the gradient dot 
product the amount by which the position vector has changed. Basically, what causes 
f to change is that I am changing x, y and z by small amounts and how sensitive f is 
to each variable is precisely what the partial derivatives measure. And, in particular, 
this approximation is called the tangent p lane approximation because it tells us, in 
fact, it amounts to identifying the graph of the function with its tangent plane. 

It means that we assume that the function depends more or less linearly on x, y and 
z. And, if we set these things equal, what we get is actua lly, we are replacing the 
function by its linear approximation. We are replacing the graph by its tangent plane. 
Except, of course, we haven't see the graph of a function of three variab les because 

that would live in 4-dimensiona l space. So, when we think of a graph, rea lly, it is a 
function of two variab les. 

That a lso tells us how to  find tangent p lanes to level surfaces. Reca ll that the tangent 
plane to a surface, given by the equation f of x, y, z equa ls z, at a g iven point can be 
found by looking first for its normal vector. And we know that the normal vector is 
actually, well, one norma l vector is given by the grad ient of a function because we 
know that the gradient is actually pointing perpendicularly to  the level sets towards 
higher values of a function. And it gives us the d irection of fastest increase of a 
function. OK. 

Any questions about these topics? No. OK. Let me add, actua lly, a cultura l note to 
what we have seen so far about partial derivatives and how to use them, which is 
maybe something I should have mentioned a couple of weeks ago. Why do we like 
partial derivatives? Well, one obvious reason is we can do a ll these things. But 
another reason is that, really, you need partia l derivatives to do physics and to 
understand much of the world that is around you because a lot of things actua lly are 
governed by what  is called partia l differentiation equations. 

So if you want a cultura l remark about what this is good for. A partial differentia l 
equation is an equation that involves the partia l derivatives of a function. So you 
have some function that is unknown that depends on a bunch of variab les. And a 
partial differential equation is some relation between its partial derivatives. Let me 
see. These are equations involving the partial derivatives --

-- of an unknown function. Let me give you an examp le to see how that works. For 
example, the heat equation is one example of a partial differential equation. It is the 
equation -- Well, let me write for you the space version of it. It is the equation 
partial f over partial t equa ls some constant times the sum of the second partials 
with respect to x, y and z. So this is an equation where we are trying to solve for a 
function f that depends, actua lly, on  four variables, x, y, z, t. 

And what should you have in mind? Well, this equation governs temperature. If you 
think that f of x, y, z, t w ill be the temperature at a point in space at position x, y, z 
and at time t,  then this tells you how temperature changes over time. It tells you 
that at any given point, the rate of change of temperature over time  is given by this 
complicated expression in the partia l derivatives in terms of the space coordinates x, 
y, z. 

If you know,  for examp le, the initial distribution of temperature in this room, and if 
you assume that nothing is generating heat or taking heat away, so if you don't have 
any air conditioning or heating going on, then it will tell you how  the temperature will 
change over time and eventua lly stabilize to some fina l va lue. Yes? Why do we take 
the partial derivative tw ice? Well, that is a question, I would say,  for a physics 
person. But in a few weeks we w ill actually see a derivation of where this equation 
comes from and try to justify it. But, really, that is something you will see in a 
physics class. The reason for that is basica lly physics of how heat  is transported 
between particles in fluid, or actua lly any med ium. 

This constant k actually is ca lled the heat conductivity. It tells you how well the heat 
flows through the materia l that you are looking at. Anyway, I am giving it to you just 
to show you an examp le of a rea l life prob lem where, in  fact, you have to solve one 
of these things. Now, how  to solve partial differentia l equations is not a top ic for this 

class. It is not even a top ic for 18.03 which is ca lled D ifferential Equations, without 
partial, which means there actually you w ill learn tools to study and solve these 
equations but when there is only one variable involved. 

And you w ill see it is already quite hard. And, if you want more on that one, we have 
many fine classes about partia l d ifferential equations. But one thing at a time. I 
wanted to point out to you that very often functions that you see in real life satisfy 
many nice relations between the partial derivatives. That was in case you were 
wondering why on the syllabus for today it sa id partial differential equations. Now we 
have officially covered the top ic. That is basica lly a ll we need to know about it. But 
we will come back to that a b it later. You w ill see. OK. If there are no further 
questions, let me continue and go back to my list of top ics. Oh, sorry. I should have 
written down that this equation is solved by temperature for point x, y, z at time t. 

OK. And there are, actually, many other interesting partial differentia l equations you 
will maybe sometimes learn about the wave equation that governs how waves 
propagate in space, about the d iffusion equation, when you have maybe a mixture of 
two fluids, how they somehow mix over time and so on. Basica lly, to every prob lem 
you might want to consider there is a partial differential equation to solve. OK. 
Anyway. Sorry. Back to my list of topics. One important application we have seen of 
partial derivatives is to try to optimize things, try to solve minimum/maximum 
problems. 

Remember that we have introduced the notion of critical points of a  function. A 
critica l point is when all the partia l derivatives are zero. And then there are various 
kinds of critical points. There is maxima and there is minimum, but there is also 
saddle points. And we have seen a method using second derivatives -- -- to decide 
which kind of critical point we have. I should say that is for a function of two 
variables to try to decide whether a given critica l point is a minimum, a maximum or 
a sadd le point. 

And we have also seen that actua lly that is not enough to  find the minimum of a 
maximum of a  function because the minimum of a maximum could occur on the 
boundary. Just to give you a small reminder, when you have a  function of one 
variables, if you are trying to find the minimum and the maximum of a function 
whose graph looks like this, well, you are going  to tell me, quite obviously, that the 
maximum is this point up here. 

And that is a point where the first derivative is zero. That is a critical point. And we 
used the second derivative to see that this critical point is a loca l maximum. But 
then, when we are looking  for the minimum of a function, well, it  is not at a critical 
point. It is actua lly here at the boundary of the domain, you know, the range of 
values that we are going to consider. Here the minimum is at the boundary. 

And the maximum is at a critica l point. Similarly, when you have a function of 
several variables, say of two variab les, for example, then the minimum and the 
maximum will be achieved either at a critical point. And then we can use these 
methods to  find where they are. Or, somewhere on the boundary of a set of va lues 
that are a llowed. It could be that we actua lly achieve a minimum by making x and y 
as small as possible. 

Maybe letting them go to zero  if they had to be positive or maybe by making them 
go to infinity. So, we have to keep our minds open and look at various possib ilities. 

We are going to do a prob lem like that. We are going to go over a practice prob lem 
from the practice test to clarify this. Another important cultural application of 
minimum/maximum problems in two variables that we have seen in class is the least 
squared method to find the best fit line, or the best fit anything, really, to find when 
you have a set of data points what is the best linear approximately for these data 
points. 

And here I have some good news for you. While you should definitely know what this 
is about, it w ill not be on the test. [APPLAUSE] That doesn't mean that you should 
forget everything we have seen about it, OK? Now what is next on my list of top ics? 
We have seen differentials. Remember the differential of f, by definition, would be 
this kind of quantity. At first it looks just like a new way to package partial 
derivatives together into some new kind of object. 

Now, what is this good for? Well,  it is a good way to remember approximation 
formulas. It is a good way to also study how variations in x, y, z relate to variations 
in f. In particular, we can d ivide this by variations, actua lly, by dx or by dy or by dz 
in any situation that we want, or by d of some other variable to get chain rules. The 
cha in rule says, for example, there are many situations. But, for example, if x, y and 
z depend on some other variable, say of variables maybe even u and v, then that 
means that f becomes a function of u and v. 

And then we can ask ourselves, how sensitive  is f to a value of u? Well, we can 
answer that. The chain rule is something like this. And let me expla in to you again 
where this comes from. Basica lly, what this quantity means is if we change u and 
keep v constant, what happens to the value of f? Well, why would the va lue of f 
change in the first p lace when  f is just a function of x, y, z and not directly of you? 
Well, it changes because x, y and z depend on u. First we have to  figure out how 
quickly x, y and z change when we change u. Well, how quickly they do that is 
precisely partial x over partial u, partial y over partial u, partial z over partial u. 

These are the rates of change of x, y, z when we change u. And now, when we 
change x, y and z, that causes f to change. How much does f change? Well, partial f 
over partial x tells us how quickly f changes if I just change x. I get this. That is the 
change in f caused just by the fact that x changes when u changes. But then y a lso 
changes. y changes at this rate. And that causes f to change at that rate. 

And z changes as well, and that causes f to change at that rate. And the effects add 
up together. Does that make sense? OK. And so, in particular, we can use the cha in 
rule to do changes of variab les. If we have, say, a function in terms of polar 
coordinates on theta and we like to switch it to rectangular coordinates x and y then 
we can use chain rules to relate the partia l derivatives. And finally,  last but not least, 
we have seen how to deal w ith non-independent variables. 

When our variab les say x, y, z related by some equation. One way we can deal with 
this is to solve for one of the variab les and go back to two independent variables, but 
we cannot a lways do that. Of course, on the exam, you can be sure that I will make 
sure that you cannot solve for a variab le you want to remove because that would be 
too easy. Then when we have to look at all of them, we will have to take  into 
account this relation, we have seen two useful methods. 

One of them is to  find the minimum of a maximum of a function when the variab les 
are not independent, and that is the method of Lagrange multipliers. Remember, to 

find the minimum or the maximum of the function f, subject to the constraint g 
equa ls constant, well, we write down equations that say that the gradient of f is 
actually proportiona l to the gradient of g. There  is a new variab le here, lambda, the 
multip lier. 

And so, for example, well, I guess here I had functions of three variab les, so this 
becomes three equations. f sub x equals lambda g sub x, f sub y equals lambda g 
sub y, and f sub z equals lambda g sub z. And, when we plug in the formulas for f 
and g, well, we are  left w ith three equations involving the four variables, x, y, z and 
lambda. What is wrong? Well, we don't have actually four independent variables. 

We also have this relation, whatever the constra int was relating x, y and z together. 
Then we can try to solve this. And, depending on the situation, it is sometimes easy. 
And it sometimes it is very hard or even impossible. But on the test, I haven't 
decided yet, but it could well be that the prob lem about Lagrange multipliers just 
asks you to write the equations and not to solve them. [APPLAUSE] 

Well, I don't know yet. I am not promising anything. But, before you start solving, 
check whether the prob lem asks you to solve them or not. If it doesn't then probably 
you shouldn't. Another topic that we solved just yesterday is constrained partia l 
derivatives. And I guess I have to re-exp lain a little bit because my guess is that 
things were not extremely clear at the end of class yesterday. Now we are in the 
same situation. We have a function,  let's say, f of x, y, z where variab les x, y and z 
are not independent but are constrained by some relation of this form. 

Some quantity involving x, y and z is equa l to maybe zero or some other constant. 
And then, what we want to know, is what is the rate of change of f w ith respect to 
one of the variables, say, x, y or z when I keep  the others constant? Well, I cannot 
keep all the other constant because that would not be compatib le w ith this cond ition. 
I mean that would be the usua l or so-called  formal partia l derivative of f ignoring the 
constra int. To take this into account means that if we vary one variable while 
keep ing another one fixed then the third one, since it depends on them, must a lso 
change somehow. And we must take that into account. Let's say, for examp le, we 
want to  find --

I am going to do a different examp le from yesterday. So, if you really d idn't like that 
one, you don't have to see it aga in. Let's say that we want to find the partia l 
derivative of f with respect to z keep ing y constant. What does that mean? That 
means y is constant, z varies and x somehow is mysteriously a  function of y and z 
for this equation. And then, of course because it depends on y, that means x will 
vary. Sorry, depends on y and z and z varies. Now we are asking ourselves what is 
the rate of change of f w ith respect to z in this situation? 

And so we have two methods to do that. Let me start with the one with differentia ls 
that hopefully you kind of understood yesterday, but if not here is a second chance. 
Using differentials means that we w ill try to express df  in terms of dz in this 
particular situation. What do we know about df in general? Well, we know that df is f 
sub x dx p lus f sub y dy plus f sub z dz. That is the general statement. But, of 
course, we are in a special case. We are in a specia l case where first y is constant. y 
is constant means that we can set dy to be zero. 

This goes away and becomes zero. The second thing is actua lly we don't care about 
x. We would like to get rid of x because it is this dependent variable. What we rea lly 

want to do is express df only in terms of dz. What we need is to relate dx with dz. 
Well, to do that, we need to look at how the variables are related so we need to look 
at the constraint g. Well, how do we do that? We look at the differentia l g. So dg is g 
sub x dx p lus g sub y dy p lus g sub z dz. And that is zero because we are setting g to 
always stay constant. 

So, g doesn't change. If g doesn't change then we have a  relation between dx, dy 
and dz. Well, in fact, we say we are going to look only at the case where y is 
constant. y doesn't change and this becomes zero. Well, now we have a relation 
between dx and dz. We know how x depends on z. And when we know how x 
depends on z, we can p lug that into here and get how f depends on z. Let's do that. 

Again, saying that g cannot change and keep ing y constant tells us g sub x dx plus g 
sub z dz is zero and we would like to solve for dx in terms of dz. That tells us dx 
should be minus g sub z dz d ivided by g sub x. If you want, this is the rate of change 
of x with respect to z when we keep y constant. In our new terminology this is partia l 
x over partia l z with y held constant. This  is the rate of change of x w ith respect to z. 
Now, when we know that, we are going to plug that into this equation. And that will 
tell us that d f is f sub x times dx. Well, what is dx? dx is now minus g sub z over g 
sub x dz p lus f sub z dz. 

So that w ill be minus fx g sub z over g sub x p lus f sub z times dz. And so  this 
coefficient here is the rate of change of f w ith respect to z in the situation we are 
considering. This quantity is what we ca ll partia l f over partial z w ith y held constant. 
That  is what we wanted to find. Now, let's see another way to do the same 
calculation and then you can choose which one you prefer. The other method is using 
the cha in rule. 

We use the chain rule to understand how  f depends on z when y  is held constant. Let 
me first try the cha in rule bruta lly and then we will try to ana lyze what is going on. 
You can just use the version that I have up  there as a temp late to see what is going 
on, but I am going to explain it more carefully again. That is the most mechanica l 
and mind less way of writing down the cha in rule. I am just saying here that I am 
varying z, keep ing y constant, and I want to know how  f changes. Well, f might 
change because x might change, y might change and z might change. 

Now, how quickly does x change? Well, the rate of change of x in this situation is 
partial x, partial z w ith y held constant. If I change x at this rate then f will change at 
that rate. Now, y might change, so the rate of change of y would be the rate of 
change of y with respect to z holding y constant. Wait a second. If y is held constant 
then y doesn't change. So, actua lly, this guy is zero and you d idn't really have to 
write that term. But I wrote it just to be systematic. If y had been somehow able to 
change at a certa in rate then that would have caused f to change at that rate. And, 
of course, if y is held constant then nothing happens here. Finally, while z is 
chang ing at a certa in rate, this rate is this one and that causes f to change at that 
rate. And then we add the effects together. 

See, it is nothing but the good-old cha in rule. Just I have put these extra subscripts 
to tell us what is held constant and what isn't. Now, of course we can simplify it a 
little bit more. Because, here, how quickly does z change if I am changing z? Well, 
the rate of change of z, with respect to itself, is just one. In fact, the really 
mysterious part of this is the one here, which is the rate of change of x w ith respect 
to z. 

And, to  find that, we have to understand the constra int. How can we find the rate of 
change of x with respect to z? Well, we could use d ifferentials, like we d id here, but 
we can a lso keep using the chain rule. How can I do that? Well, I can just look at 
how g would change with respect to z when y is held constant. I just do the same 
calculation with g instead of f. But, before I do it, let's ask ourselves first what is this 
equa l to. Well, if g is held constant then, when we vary z keep ing y constant and 
chang ing x, well, g still doesn't change. It is held constant. 

In fact,  that should be zero. But, if we just say that, we are not going to get to that. 
Let's see how we can compute that using the chain rule. Well, the chain rule tells us 
g changes because x, y and z change. How does it change because of x? Well, partial 
g over partia l x times the rate of change of x. How does it change because of y? 
Well, partia l g over partial y times the rate of change of y. But, of course, if you are 
smarter than me then you don't need to actua lly write this one because y is held 
constant. And then there is the rate of change because z changes. 

And how quickly z changes here, of course, is one. Out of this you get, well, I am 
tired of writing partia l g over partial x. We can just write g sub x times partial x over 
partial z y constant p lus g sub z. And now we found how x depends on z. Partial x 
over partial z with y held constant is negative g sub z over g sub x. Now we plug that 
into  that and we get our answer. It goes all the way up here. And then we get the 
answer. I am not going to, well, I guess I can write  it again. 

There was partia l f over partia l x times this guy, minus g sub z over g sub x, p lus 
partial f over partial z. And you can observe that this is exactly the same formula 
that we had over here. In fact, let's compare this to make it side by side. I claim we 
did exactly the same thing, just w ith different notations. If you take the d ifferential 
of f and you divide it by dz in this situation where y is held constant and so on, you 
get exactly this chain rule up there. That cha in rule up there is this guy, d f, divided 
by dz with y held constant. And the term involving dy was rep laced by zero on both 
sides because we knew, actua lly, that y is held constant. 

Now, the rea l d ifficulty in both cases comes from dx. And what we do about dx is we 
use the constant. Here we use it by writing dg equals zero. Here we write the cha in 
rule for g, which is the same thing, just d ivided by dz with y held constant. This 
formula or that formula are the same, just divided by dz w ith y held constant. And 
then, in both cases, we used that to solve for dx. And then we p lugged into the 
formula of d f to express d f over dz, or partia l f, partial z w ith y held constant. So, the 
two methods are pretty much the same. Quick poll. Who prefers this one? Who 
prefers that one? OK. Majority vote seems to be for differentia ls, but it doesn't mean 
that it is better. Both are fine. You can use whichever one you want. 

But you should give both a try. OK. Any questions? Yes? Yes. Thank you. I forgot to 
mention it. Where did  that go? I think I erased that part. We need to know -- --
directiona l derivatives. Pretty much the only thing to remember about them is that d f 
over ds, in the d irection of some unit vector u, is just the gradient f dot product w ith 
u. That is pretty much a ll we know about them. Any other top ics that I forgot to list? 
No. Yes? 

Can I erase three boards at a time? No, I would need three hands to do that. I think 
what we should do now  is look quickly at the practice test. I mean, given the time, 
you will mostly have to think about it yourselves. Hopefully you have a copy of the 

practice exam. The first prob lem is a simple problem. Find the gradient. Find an 
approximation formula. Hopefully you know how to do that. The second problem is 
one about writing a contour p lot. And so, before I let you go  for the weekend, I want 
to make sure that you actually know how to read a contour plot. 

One thing I should mention is this problem asks you to estimate partial derivatives 
by writing a contour plot. We have not done that, so that will not actually be on the 
test. We will be doing qua litative questions like what is the sine of a partia l 
derivative. Is it zero, less than zero or more than zero? You don't need to bring a 
ruler to estimate partial derivatives the way that this prob lem asks you to. 
[APPLAUSE] 

Let's look at prob lem 2B. Problem 2B is asking you to find the point at which h 
equa ls 2200, partia l h over partia l x equals zero and partial h over partial y is less 
than zero. Let's try and see what is going on here. A point where f equals 2200, well, 
that should be probably on the level curve that says 2200. We can actua lly zoom in. 
Here is the level 2200. Now  I want partia l h over partial x to be zero. 

That means if I change x, keeping y constant, the va lue of h doesn't change. Which 
points on the level curve satisfy that property? It is the top and the bottom. If you 
are here, for examp le, and you move  in the x direction, well, you see, as you get to 
there from the left, the height first increases and then decreases. It goes for a 
maximum at that point. So, at that point, the partial derivative is zero with respect 
to x. And the same here. Now,  let's find partial h over partial y less than zero. That 
means  if we go north we should go down. Well, which one is it,  top or bottom? Top. 
Yes. 

Here, if you go north,  then you go from 2200 down to 2100. This is where the point 
is. Now, the problem here was also asking you to estimate partia l h over partia l y. 
And if you were curious how you would do that, well, you would try to  figure out how 
long it takes before you reach the next level curve. To go from here to here, to go 
from Q to this new point, say Q prime, the change in y, well, you would have to read 
the scale, which was down here, would be about something like 300. What is the 
change in height when you go from Q to Q prime? Well, you go down  from 2200 to 
2100. That is actua lly minus 100 exactly. 

OK? And so delta h over delta y is about minus one-third, well, minus 100 over 300 
which is minus one-third. And that is an approximation for partial derivative. So,  that 
is how you would do it. Now, let me go back to other things. If you  look at this 
practice exam, basica lly there  is a bit of everything and it is kind of fairly 
representative of what might happen on Tuesday. There will be a mix of easy 
problems and of harder problems. Expect something about computing gradients, 
approximations, rate of change. Expect a prob lem about read ing a contour p lot. 

Expect one about a min/max problem, something about Lagrange multip liers, 
something about the chain rule and something about constrained partial derivatives. 
I mean pretty much all the top ics are going to be there. Yes? Yes, in a min/max 
problem, you have to look at the boundaries. Look at how it is done here. OK. Have
