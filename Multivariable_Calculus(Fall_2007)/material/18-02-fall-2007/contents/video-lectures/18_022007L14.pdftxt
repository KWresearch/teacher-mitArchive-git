18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 14 

OK, so  first of a ll there used to be,  is the sound system working? Can you hear me  in 
the back? Can anyone here in the back? No? Can we make it a b it louder? Oh, yeah, 
OK, it should be good now. So there used to be problem set solutions, new problem 
sets, practice exams. I'm pretty much out of everything. It w ill a ll be on the Web. 
The practice exams have been on the webpage for a while. 

So, you can get  it there. So -- OK, some information about the exam: so the next 
test in this class is on Tuesday, and it will be in the same place as last time. OK, so 
some of you go to Walker Memoria l third  floor. Some of you come here. The basic 
rule is you go to the same place as last time, namely, if your last name starts with A-
R or if you're left handed, then you go to Walker. If your last name starts with S-Z 
and you're right handed, then you come here. And if you're confused, you go to 
wherever you can make  it. As usual, no documents, no ca lculators a llowed. And, as 
usua l, we w ill be discussing the practice exams in lecture and  recitation. 

So, tomorrow basica lly will be a  review session. We'll go over practice 2A. So, please 
bring it back tomorrow. And, practice 2B will be discussed in recitation on Monday. 
So, before that, we have one more top ic to cover. So,  today we'll learn about some 
new cool stuff about partial derivatives with constraints. OK, so this w ill be actua lly 
on the exam a lso, but it's the last top ic that will be of the exam. And, the new 
problem set is only due next Thursday. So, in principle, you don't need to start 
working on it until after the exam. I would still like you encourage you to actually 
have a look at it because basically you can do all of it today. And, it's actually not 
that hard. It's actually good practice on the topic that we're going to see today. So, if 
you want practice on that, then you should look at the p-set. 

OK, so we're going to continue looking at what happens when we have non-
independent variables. So, I'm afra id we don't take deliveries during class time, 
sorry. P lease take a seat, thanks. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] OK, so Jason, you p lease 
cla im your package at the end of lecture. OK, so last time we saw how  to use 
Lagrange multipliers to  find the minimum or maximum of a function of several 
variables when the variables are not independent. And, today we're going to  try to 
figure out more about relations between the variables, and how  to hand le functions 
that depend on severa l variab les when they're related. So, just to give you an 
example, in physics, very often, you have functions that depend on pressure, 
volume, and temperature where pressure, volume, and temperature are actua lly not 
independent. 

But they are related, say, by PV=nRT. So, of course, then you can substitute and 
expressed a function in terms of two of them only, but very often it's convenient to 
keep all three. But then we have to figure out, what are the rates of change with 
respect to t, w ith respect to each other, the rate of change of f with respect to  these 
variables, and so on. So, we have to figure out what we mean by partia l derivatives 
again. 

So, OK, more generally,  let's say just for the sake of notation, I'm going to think of a 
function of three variables, x, y, z, where the variab les are related by some 
equation, but I w ill put in the form g of x, y, z equals some constant. OK, so that's 
the same kind of setup as we had last time, except now we are not just looking for 
minima and maxima. We are trying to understand partial derivatives. 

So, the first observation is that if x, y, and z are related, then that means, in 
principle, we could solve for one of them, and express it as a function of the two 
others. So, in particular, can we understand even w ithout solving? Maybe we can not 
solve. Can we understand how  the variab les are related to each other? So,  for 
example, z, you can think of z as a function of x and y. So, we can ask ourselves, 
what are the rates of change of z w ith respect to x, keeping y constant, or w ith 
respect to y keeping x constant? And, of course, if we can solve, that we know the 
formula for this. 

And then we can compute these guys. But, what if we can't solve? So, how do we 
find these things without solving? Well, so let's do an example. Let's say that my 
relation is x^2 yz z^3=8. And, let's say that I'm looking near the point (x, y, z) 
equa ls (2, 3, 1). So, let me check 2^2 plus three times one plus 1^3 is indeed eight. 
OK, but now, if I change x and y a little bit, how does z change? Well, of course I 
could solve for z in here. It's a cubic equation. There is actually a formula. But that 
formula is quite complicated. We actua lly don't want to do that. There's an easier 
way. 

So, how can we do  it? Well, let's look at the differential -- -- of this constra int 
quantity. OK, so if we called this g,  let's look at dg. So, what's the differentia l of this? 
So, the differentia l of x^2 is 2x dx p lus, I think there's a zdy. There's a ydz, and 
there's also a 3z^2 dz. OK, you can get this either by imp licit d ifferentiation and the 
product rule, or you could get this just by putting here, here, and here the partial 
derivatives of this with respect to x, y, and z. 

OK, any questions about how I got this? No? OK. So, now, what do I do w ith this? 
Well, this represents, somehow, variations of g. But, well, I've set this thing equal to 
eight. And, eight is a constant. So,  it doesn't change. So, in  fact, well, we can set 
this to zero because, well, they call this g. Then, g equa ls eight is constant. That 
means we set dg equal to zero. OK, so, now let's just plug in some va lues at this 
point. 

That tells us, well, so if x equals two, that's 4dx plus z is one. So, dy plus y 3z^2 
should be 6dz equa ls zero. And now, this equation, here, tells us about a relation 
between the changes in x, y, and z near that point. It tells us how you change x and 
y, well, how z will change. Or, it tells you actually anything you might want to know 
about the relations between these variab les so,  for examp le, you can move dz to 
that side, and then express dz in terms of dx and dy. Or, you can move dy to that 
side and express dy in terms of dx and dz, and so on. It tells you at the level of the 
derivatives how each of the variables depends on the two others. 

OK, so, just to clarify this: if we want to view z as a  function of x and y, then what 
we will do is we will just move the dz 's to the other side, and it will tell us dz equals 
minus one over six times 4dx plus dy. And, so that should tell you that partia l z over 
partial x is minus four over six. Well, that's minus two thirds, and partia l z over 
partial y is going to be minus one sixth. OK, another way to think about this: when 

we compute partial z over partia l x, that means that actua lly we keep y constant. 
OK, let me actua lly add some subtitles here. 

So, here that means we keep y constant. And so, if we keep y constant, another way 
to think about it is we set dy to zero. We set dy equa ls zero. So if we do  that, we get 
dx equa ls negative four sixths dx. That tells us the rate of change of z w ith respect 
to x. Here, we set x constant. So, that means we set dx equa l to zero. And, if we set 
dx equa l to zero, then we have dz equals negative one sixth of dy. That tells us the 
rate of change of z w ith respect to y. OK, any questions about that? 

No? What, yes? Yes, OK, let me exp lain that aga in. So we found an expression  for dz 
in terms of dx and dy. That means that this thing, the differentia l, is the total 
differentia l of z viewed as a  function of x and y. OK, and so the coefficients of dx and 
dy are the partia ls. Or, another way to  think about it,  if you want to know partia l z 
partial x, it means you set y to be constant. Setting y to be constant means that you 
will put zero in the place of dy. 

So, you will be left with dz equals minus four sixths dx. And,  that w ill give you the 
rate of change of z w ith respect to x when you keep y constant, OK? So, there are 
various ways to think about this, but hopefully it makes sense. OK, so how do we 
think about this  in genera l? Well, if we know  that g of x, y, z equals a constant, then 
dg, which is gxdx gydy gzdz should be set equa l to zero. OK, and now we can solve 
for whichever variable we want to express in terms of the others. So, for example, if 
we care about z as a function of x and y --

-- we'll get that dz is negative gx over gz dx minus gy over gz dy. And, so if we want 
partial z over partial x, so, well, so one way  is just to say that's going to be the 
coefficient of dx in here, or just to write down the other way. We are setting y equa ls 
constant. So, that means we set dy equa l to zero. And then, we get dz equa ls 
negative gx over gz dx. So, that means partial z over partia l x is minus gx over gz. 

And, see, that's a very counterintuitive formula because you have this minus sign 
that you somehow probably couldn't have seen come if you hadn't actua lly derived 
things this way. I mean, it's pretty surprising to see that minus sign come out of 
nowhere the first time you see it. OK, so now we know how to find the rate of 
change of constrained variables w ith respect to each other. You can apply the same 
to find, if you want partia l x, partial y, or any of them, you can do it. Any questions 
so far? No? OK, so, before we proceed  further, I should probab ly expose some 
problem w ith the notations that we have so  far. 

So, let me try to get you a b it confused, OK? So, let's take a very simp le examp le. 
Let's say I have a function, f of x, y equa ls x y. OK, so  far it doesn't sound very 
confusing. And then, I can write partial f over partial x. And, I think you all know 
how to compute it. It's going to be just one. OK, so far we are pretty happy. Now 
let's do a change of variab les. Let's set x=u and y=u v. It's not very comp licated 
change of variab les. But let's do  it. 

Then,  f in terms of u and v, well, so  f, remember f was x y becomes u p lus u p lus v. 
That's twice u p lus v. What's partial f over partia l u? It's two. So, x and u are the 
same thing. Partial f over partial x, and partia l f over partial u, well, unless you 
believe that one equals two, they are really not the same thing, OK? So, that's an 
interesting, slightly strange phenomenon. x equals u, but partial f partial x is not the 
same as partial f partial u. 

So, how do we get rid of this contradiction? Well, we have to think a bit more about 
what these notations mean, OK? So, when we write partial f over partial x, it means 
that we are varying x, keeping y constant. When we write partia l f over partial u, it 
means we are varying u, keeping v constant. So, varying u or varying x is the same 
thing. But, keeping v constant, or keep ing y constant are not the same thing. 

If I keep y constant, then when I change x, so when I change u, then v w ill a lso have 
to change so that their sum stays the same. Or, if you prefer the other way around, 
when I do this one I keep v constant. If I keep v constant and I change u, then y will 
change. It won't be constant. So, that means, well, life looked quite nice and easy 
with these notations. But, what's dangerous about them is they are not making 
exp licit what it is exactly that we are keeping constant. 

OK, so just to write things, so here we change u and x that are the same thing. But 
we keep y constant, while here we change u, which  is still the same thing as x. But, 
what we keep constant is v, or in terms of x and y,  that's y minus x constant. And, 
that's why they are not the same. So, whenever there's any risk of confusion, OK, so 
not in the cases that we had before because what we've done until now, we d idn't 
really have a problem. But, in a situation like this, to clarify things, we'll actua lly say 
exp licitly what  it is that we want to keep constant. 

OK, so what's going to be our new notation? Well, so it's not particularly pleasant 
because it uses, now, a subscript not to indicate what you are d ifferentiating, but 
rather what you were holding constant. So, that's quite a conflict of notation w ith 
what we had before. I think I can safely blame it on physicists or chemists. OK, so 
this one means we keep y constant, and partia l f over partia l u w ith v held constant, 
similarly. 

OK, so now what happens is we no longer have any contrad iction. We have partia l f 
over partial x w ith y constant is d ifferent from partial f over partial x w ith v constant, 
which is the same as partia l f over partial u with v constant. OK, so  this guy is one. 
And these guys are two. So, now we can safely use the fact that x equals u if we are 
keep ing track of what is actua lly held constant, OK? So now, that's going to be 
particularly important when we have variables that are related because, let's say 
now that I have a function that depends on x, y, and z. But, x, y, and z are related. 
Then, it means that I look at, say, x and y as my independent variables, and z as a 
function of x and y. 

Then, it means that when I do partia ls, say, with respect to x, I will hold y constant. 
But, I w ill let z vary as a  function of x and y. Or, I could do  it the other way around. I 
could vary x, keep z constant, and  let y be a function of x and z. And so, I will need 
to use this kind of notation to ind icate which one I mean. OK, any questions? No? All 
right, so let's try to do an examp le where we have a function that depends on 
variables that are related. OK, so I don't want to do one with PV=nRT because 
probably, I mean, if you've seen it, then you've seen too much of it. 

And, if you haven't seen  it, then maybe it's not the best examp le. So, let's do a 
geometric examp le. So, let's look at the area of the triang le. So, let's say I have a 
triangle, and my variables w ill be the sides a and b. And the ang le here, theta. OK, 
so what's the area of this triangle? Well, its base times height over two. So, it's one 
half of the base  is a, and the height is b sine theta. OK, so that's a function of a, b, 
and theta. Now, let's say, actua lly, there is a relation between a, b, and theta that I 

didn't tell you about, namely, actually, I want to assume that it's a right triangle, 
OK? 

So, let's now assume it's a  right triangle with, let's say,  the hypotenuse is b. So, we 
have the right angle here, actually. So, a is here. b is here. Theta is here. So, saying 
it's a  right triangle is the same thing as saying that b equa ls sine theta, OK? So 
that's our constra int. That's the relation between a, b, and theta. And, this is a 
function of a, b, and theta. And, let's say that we want to understand how  the area 
depends on theta. OK, what's the rate of change of the area of this triangle with 
respect to theta? So, I cla im  there's various answers. I can think of at least three 
possible answers. 

So, what can we possib ly mean by the rate of change of A with respect to theta? So, 
these are all things that we might want to call partial A partia l theta. But of course, 
we'll have to actually use different notations to distinguish them. So, the first way 
that we actually a lready know about is if we just forget about the fact that the 
variables are related, OK? So, if we just think of little a, b, and theta as independent 
variables, and we just change theta, keeping a and b constant --

So, that's exactly what we meant by partia l A, partial theta, right? I'm not putting 
any constraints. So, just to use some new notation, that would be the rate of change 
of A with respect to theta, keeping a and b fixed at the same time. Of course, if we 
are keeping a and b fixed, and we are changing  theta, it means we comp letely ignore 
this property of being a right triangle. So, in  fact, it corresponds to changing the area 
by changing the angle, keeping these  lengths fixed. And, of course, we lose the right 
angle. 

When we rotate this side here, but the angle doesn't stay at a right ang le. And that 
one, we know how to compute, right, because it's the one we've been computing a ll 
along. So, that means we keep a and b  fixed. And then, so let's see, what's the 
derivatives of A w ith respect to theta? It's one half ab cosine theta. OK, now that one 
we know. Any questions? No? OK, the two other guys will be more interesting. So 
far, I'm not rea lly doing anything with my constraint. Let's say that actua lly I do 
want to keep the right angle. 

Then, when I change theta, there's two options. One is I keep a constant, and then 
of course b will have to change because if this w idth stays the same, then when I 
change theta, the height increases, and then this side length increases. The other 
option is to change the angle, keep ing b constant. So, actua lly, this side stays the 
same length. But then, a has to become a bit shorter. And, of course, the area w ill 
change in d ifferent ways depending on what I do. So, that's why I said we have 
three different answers. So, the next one is keep, I forgot which one I said first. Let's 
say keep a constant. And, that means that b will change. b is going to be some 
function of a and theta. 

Well, in  fact here, we know what the function is because we can solve the constra int, 
namely, b is a over cosine theta. But we don't actually need to know that so that the 
triangle, so that the right angle, so that we keep a right ang le. And, so the name we 
will have for this is partial a over partia l theta w ith a held constant, OK? And, the 
fact that I'm not putting b in my subscript there means that actua lly b w ill be a 
dependent variable. It changes in whatever way it has to change so that when theta 
changes, a stays the same while b changes so  that we keep a right triang le. 

And, the third guy is the one where we actually keep b constant, and now a, we 
think a as a function of b and theta, and it changes so that we keep the right ang le. 
So actually as a  function of b and theta, it's given over there. A equa ls b cosine 
theta. And so, this guy is called partial a over partial theta w ith b held constant. OK, 
so we've just defined them. We don't know yet how to compute these things. That's 
what we're going to do now. That is the definition, and what these things mean. 

Is that clear to everyone? Yes, OK. Yes? OK, so  the second answer, aga in, so one 
way to ask ourselves, how does the area depend on theta, is to say, well, actua lly 
look at the area of the right triang le as a function of a and theta only by solving  for 
b. And then, we'll change theta, keep a constant, and ask, how does the area 
change? So, when we do that, when we change theta and keep a the same, then b 
has to change so that it stays a  right triang le, right, so that this relation still holds. 
That requires us to change b. So, when we write partia l a over partial theta with a 
constant,  it means that, actua lly, b w ill be the dependent variable. 

It depends on a and theta. And so, the area depends on theta, not only because 
theta is in the formula, but a lso because b changes, and b is in the formula. Yes? No, 
no, we don't keep theta constant. We vary theta, right? The goal is to see how things 
change when I change theta by a little b it. OK, so if I change theta a little bit  in this 
one, if I change theta a little bit and I keep a the same, then b has to change also in 
some way. There's a right triangle. And then, because theta and b change, that 
causes the area to change. OK, so maybe I should re-expla in that again. So, theta 
changes. 

A is constant. But, we have the constraint, a equals be plus sine theta. That means 
that b changes. And then, the question is, how does A change? Well, it w ill change in 
part because theta changes, and in part because b changes. But, we want to know 
how it depends on theta  in this situation. Yes? Ah, that's a very good question. So, 
what about, I don't keep a and b constant? Well, then there's too many choices. So I 
have to decide actually how I'm going to change things. See, if I just say I have this 
relation, that means I have two independent variables left, whichever two of the 
three I want. But, I still have to specify two of them to say exactly which triangle I 
mean. So, I cannot ask myself just how w ill it change if I change theta and do 
random things with a and b? 

It depends what I do with a and b. Of course, I could choose to change them 
simultaneously, but then I have to specify how exactly I'm going to do  that. Ah, yes, 
if you wanted to, indeed, we could also change things in such a way that the third 
side remains constant. And that would be, yet, a different way to attack the problem. 
I mean, we don't have good notation  for this, here, because we didn't give it a name. 
But, yeah, I mean, we could. We could ca ll this guy c, and then we'd have a different 
formula, and so on. So, I mean, I'm not looking at it for simplicity. But, you could 
have many more. 

I mean, in general, you w ill want, once you have a set of nice, natura l variab les, you 
will want to look mostly at situations where one of the variables changes. Some of 
them are held fixed, and then some dependent variable does whatever it must so 
that the constra int keeps holding. OK, so let's try to compute one of them. Let's say 
I decide that we will compute this one. OK, let's see how we can compute partial a, 
partial theta w ith a held fixed. 

[APPLAUSE] OK, so let's try to compute partial A, partia l theta w ith a held constant. 
So, let's see three different ways of doing that. So, let me start with method zero. 
OK, it's not a real method. That's why I'm not getting a positive number. So, that 
one  is just, we solve for b, and we remove b from the formulas. OK, so here it works 
well because we know how to solve for b. But I'm not considering this to be a real 
method because in genera l we don't know how  to do that. I mean, in the beginning I 
had this relation that was an equation of degree three. You don't really want to solve 
your equation  for the dependent variable usually. Here, we can. So, solve for b and 
substitute. 

So, how do we do that? Well, the constraint is a=b cosine theta. That means b is a 
over cosine theta. Some of you know that as a secan theta. That's the same. And 
now, if we express the area in terms of a and theta only, A is one half of ab cosine, 
sorry, ab sine theta is now one half of a^2 sine theta over cosine theta. Or, if you 
prefer, one ha lf of a^2 tangent theta. Well, now that it's only a  function of a and 
theta, I know what it means to take the partial derivative with respect to theta, 
keep ing a constant. I know how to do it. 

So, partia l A over partia l theta, a held constant, well, if a is a constant, then I get 
this one half a^2 coming out times, what's the derivative of tangent? Secan squared, 
very good. If you're European and you've never heard of secan, that's one over 
cosine. And, if you know the derivative as one plus tangent squared,  that's the same 
thing. And, it's a lso correct. OK, so, that's one way of doing it. But, as I've already 
said, it doesn't get us very far if we don't know how to solve for b. We really used 
the fact that we could solve for b and get rid of it. So, there's two systematic 
methods, and let's say the basic rule is that you should g ive both of them a chance. 

You should see which one you prefer, and you should be ab le to use one or the other 
on the exam. OK, most likely you'll actually have a choice between one or the other. 
It will be up to you to decide which one you want to use. But, you cannot use solving 
in substitution. That's not fa ir. OK, so the first one is to use d ifferentials. By the way, 
in the notes they are called a lso method one and method two. I'm not promising that 
I have the same one, am I? I mean, I might have one and two switched. It doesn't 
really matter. So, how do we do things using d ifferentia ls? Well, first, we know that 
we want to keep a  fixed, and that means that we'll set da equal to zero, OK? 

The second thing that we want to do is we want to look at the constra int. The 
constra int  is a equals b cosine theta. And, we want to differentiate that. Well, 
differentiate the left-hand side. You get da. And, differentiate the right-hand side as 
a function of b and theta. You should get, well, how many db's? Well, that's the rate 
of change with respect to b. That's cosine theta db minus b sine theta d theta. 

That's a product rule applied to b times cosine theta. So -- Well, now, if we have a 
constra int that's relating da, db, and d theta, OK, so that's actually what we did, 
right, that's the same sort of thing as what we did at the beg inning when we related 
dx, dy, and dz. That's rea lly the same thing, except now are variab les are a, b, and 
theta. Now, we know that also we are keeping a fixed. So actually, we set this equal 
to zero. So, we have zero equa ls da equals cosine theta db minus b sine theta d 
theta. That means that actua lly we know how to solve for db. 

OK, so cosine theta db equa ls b sine theta d theta or db is b tangent theta d theta. 
OK, so  in fact, what we found, if you want, is the rate of change of b with respect to 
theta. Why do we care? Well, we care because let's look, now, at dA,  the function 

that we want to look at. OK, so the function is A equals one ha lf ab sine theta. Well, 
then, dA, so we had to use the product rule carefully, or we use the partials. 

So, the coefficient of d little a w ill be partia l w ith respect to little a. That's one half b 
sine theta da p lus coefficient of db will be one half a sine theta db plus coefficient of 
d theta w ill be one ha lf ab cosine theta d theta. But now, what do I do w ith that? 
Well, first I sa id a is constant. So, da is zero. Second, well, actua lly we don't like b at 
all, right? We want to view a as a  function of theta. So, well, maybe we actua lly want 
to use this formula  for db that we found in here. OK, and  then we'll be left only w ith 
d thetas, which is what we want. 

So, if we plug this one into that one, we get da equa ls one ha lf a sine theta times b 
tangent theta d theta plus one half ab cosine theta d theta. And, if we collect these 
things together, we get one ha lf of ab times sine theta times tangent theta plus 
cosine theta d theta. And, if you know your trig, but you'll see that this is sine 
squared over cosine p lus cosine squared over cosine. That's the same as secan 
theta. So, now you have expressed da as something times d theta. Well, that 
coefficient is the rate of change of A with respect to theta w ith the understanding 
that we are keeping a  fixed, and letting b vary as a dependent variable. 

Not enough space: sorry. OK, in case it's clearer for you,  let's think about it 
backwards. So, we wanted to find how A changes. To  find how A changes, we write 
da. But now, this tells us how A depends on little a, little b, and theta. Well, we know 
actually we want to keep little a constant. So, we set this to be zero. Theta, well, we 
are very happy because we want to express things in terms of theta. 

Db we want to get rid of. How do we get rid of db? Well, we do that by figuring out 
how b depends on theta when a  is fixed. And, we do that by d ifferentiating the 
constra int equation, and setting da equa l to zero. OK, so -- I guess to summarize the 
method, we wrote dA in terms of da, db, d theta. Then, we say that a is constant 
means we set da equals zero. And, the third thing is that because, well, we 
differentiate the constraint. 

And, we can solve for db in terms of d theta. And then, we plug into dA, and we get 
the answer. OK, oops. So, here's another method to do the same thing differently is 
to use the cha in rule. So, we can use the chain rule w ith dependent variab les, OK? 
So, what does the chain rule tell us? The cha in rule tells us, so we will want to 
differentiate -- -- the formula  for a w ith respect to theta holding a constant. So, I 
cla im, well, what does the chain rule tell us? It tells us that, well, when we change 
things, a changes because of the changes in the variables. So, part of it is that A 
depends on theta and theta changes. How  fast does theta change? 

Well, you could call that the rate of change of theta with respect to theta with a 
constant. But of course, how fast does theta depend to  itself? The answer is one. So, 
that's pretty easy. Plus, then we have the partia l derivative,  forma l partial derivative, 
of A with respect to little a  times the rate of change of a in our situation. Well, how 
does little a change if a is constant? Well, it doesn't change. And then, there is Ab, 
the forma l partia l derivative times, sorry, the rate of change of b. OK, and how do 
we find this one? Well, here we have to use the constra int. 

OK, and we can find this one from the constraint as we've seen at the beginning 
either by differentiating the constra int, or by using the cha in rule on the constraint. 
So, of course the ca lculations are exactly the same. See, this is the same formula as 

the one over there, just divid ing everything by partial theta and with subscripts little 
a. But, if it's easier to think about it this way, then that's also va lid. 

OK, so  tomorrow we are going to review for the test, so I'm going to tell you a bit 
more about this a lso as we go over one practice problem on that.
