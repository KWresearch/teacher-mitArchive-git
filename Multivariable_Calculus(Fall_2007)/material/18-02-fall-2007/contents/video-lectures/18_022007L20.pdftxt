18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript – Lecture 20 

So, let me remind you, yesterday we've defined and started to compute line integra ls 
for work as a vector field a long a curve. So, we have a curve  in the plane, C. We 
have a vector field that g ives us a vector at every point. And, we want to find the 
work done along the curve. So, that's the line integral a long C of F dr, or more 
geometrically,  line integral along C of F.T ds where T is the unit tangent vector, 

and ds is the arc length element. Or, in coord inates, that they integra l of M dx N dy 
where M and N are the components of the vector field. OK, so -- Let's do an example 
that will just summarize what we d id yesterday, and then we will move on to 
interesting observations about these things. So, here's an examp le we are going to 
look at now. Let's say I give you the vector field yi p lus xj. So, it's not comp letely 
obvious what it looks like, but here is a computer p lot of that vector field. 

So, that tells you a b it what it does. It points in all sorts of directions. And, let's say 
we want to find the work done by this vector field. If I move along this closed curve, 
I start at the origin. But, I moved along the x-axis to one. That move a long the unit 
circle to the diagona l, and then I move back to the orig in in a straight line. OK, so C 
consists of three parts -- -- so that you enclose a sector of a unit d isk -- --
corresponding to angles between zero and 45°. 

So, to compute this line integral, all we have to do is we have set up three d ifferent 
integrals and add that together. OK, so we need to set up the integral of y dx plus x 
dy for each of these pieces. So, let's do the first one on the x-axis. Well, one way to 
parameterize that is just use the x variable. And, say that because we are on the, 
let's see, sorry, we are going from the orig in to (1,0). 

Well, we know we are on the x-axis. So, y there is actually just zero. And, the 
variable will be x from zero to one. Or, if you prefer, you can parameterize things, 
say, x equals t for t from zero to one, and y equals zero. What doesn't change is y is 
zero, and therefore, dy is a lso zero. So, in fact, we are integrating y dx x dy, but that 
becomes, well, zero dx 0, and that's just going to give you zero. 

OK, so  there's the line integral. Here, it's very easy to compute. Of course, you can 
also do it geometrica lly because geometrica lly, you can see in the picture along the 
x-axis, the vector field is pointing vertica lly. If I'm on the x-axis, my vector field is 
actually in the y direction. So, it's perpend icular to my curve. So, the work done is 
going to be zero. F dot T w ill be zero. OK, so F dot T is zero, so the integral is zero. 

OK, any questions about this first part of the calculation? No? It's OK? OK, let's move 
on to more interesting part of it. Let's do the second part, which is a portion of the 
unit circle. OK, so I should have drawn my picture. And so now we are moving on 
this part of the curve that's C2. And, of course we have to choose how to express x 
and y in terms of a sing le variab le. Well, most likely, when you are moving on a 
circle, you are going to use the angle along the circle to tell you where you are. 

OK, so we're going to use the angle theta as a parameter. And we will say, we are on 
the unit circle. So, x is cosine theta and y is sine theta. What's the range of theta? 
Theta goes from zero to pi over four, OK? So, whenever I see dx, I w ill replace it by, 
well, the derivative of cosine is negative sine. So, minus sine theta d theta, and dy, 
the derivative of sine is cosine. So, it w ill become cosine theta d theta. 

OK, so I'm computing the integral of y dx x dy. That means -- -- I'll be actua lly 
computing the integral of, so, y is sine theta. dx, that's negative sine theta d theta 
plus x cosine. dy is cosine theta d theta from zero to pi/4. OK, so that's integra l from 
zero to pi / 4 of cosine squared minus sine squared. And, if you know your trig, then 
you should recognize this as cosine of two theta. OK, so that will integrate to one 
half of sine two  theta from zero to p i over four, sorry. 

And, sine pi over two is one. So, you will get one half. OK, any questions about this 
one? No? OK,  then let's do the third one. So, the third guy is when we come back to 
the origin a long the diagona l. OK, so we go in a straight line from this point. Where's 
this point? Well, this point is one over root two, one over root two. And, we go back 
to the origin. OK, so we need to figure out a way to express x and y in terms of the 
same parameter. 

So, one way which is very natural would be to just say, well, let's say we move from 
here to here over time. And, at time zero, we are here. At time one, we are here. We 
know how to parameterize this line. So, what we could do is say, let's parameterize 
this line. So, we start at one over root two, and we go down by one over root two in 
time one. And, same w ith y. That's actua lly perfectly fine. 

But that's unnecessarily complicated. OK, why is a complicated? Because we w ill get 
all of these expressions. It would be easier to actually just look at motion in this 
direction and then say, well, if we have a certa in work  if we move from here to here, 
then the work done moving from here to here is just going to be the opposite, OK? 
So, in  fact, we can do slightly better by just saying, well, we'll take x = t, y = t. 

t from zero to one over root two, and take, well, sorry, that gives us what I w ill call 
minus C3, which is C3 backwards. And then we can say the integral for work along 
minus C3 is the opposite of the work a long C3. Or, if you're comfortab le w ith 
integration where variab les go down, then you could also say that t just goes from 
one over square root of two down to zero. And, when you set up your integra l, it w ill 
go from one over root two to zero. 

And, of course, that will be the negative of the one from zero  to one over root two. 
So, it's the same thing. OK, so if we do it w ith this parameterization, we'll get that, 
well of course, dx is dt, dy is dt. So, the integra l along minus C3 of y dx plus x dy is 
just the integra l from zero to one over root two of t dt plus t dt. Sorry, I'm messing 
up my blackboard, OK, which is going to be, well, the integra l of 2t dt, which is t2 
between these bounds, which is one half. 

That's the integral a long minus C3, a long the reversed path. And, if I want to do it 
along C3 instead, then I just take the negative. Or, if you prefer, you could have 
done it directly w ith integra l from one over root two, two zero, which g ives you 
immed iately the negative one half. OK, so at the end, we get that the tota l work -- --
was the sum of the three line integra ls. I'm not writing after dr just to save space. 

But, zero plus one ha lf minus one ha lf, and that comes out to zero. So, a lot of 
calculations for nothing. OK, so that should give you overview of various ways to 
compute line integra ls. Any questions about all that? No? OK. So, next, let me tell 
you about how to avoid computing like integrals. Well, one is easy: don't take this 
class. But that's not, so here's another way not to do it, OK? 

So, let's look a little b it about one kind of vector field that actually we've 
encountered a  few weeks ago without saying it. So, we said when we have a  function 
of two variables, we have the gradient vector. Well, at the time, it was just a vector. 
But,  that vector depended on x and y. So, in fact, it's a vector field. OK, so here's an 
interesting special case. Say that F, our vector field is actua lly the grad ient of some 
function. 

So, it's a grad ient field. And, so f is a  function of two variables, x and y, and that's 
called the potential for the vector field. The reason is, of course, from physics. In 
physics, you call potentia l, electrical potentia l or gravitationa l potentia l, the potentia l 
energy. This function of position that tells you how much actua lly energy stored 
somehow by the force field, and this grad ient gives you the force. 

Actually, not quite. If you are a physicist, that the force will be negative the grad ient. 
So, that means that physicists' potentials are the opposite of a mathematician's 
potential. Okay? So it's just here to confuse you. It doesn't rea lly matter a ll the time. 
So to make things simpler we are using this convention and you just put a minus 
sign  if you are doing physics. So then I cla im that we can simplify the evaluation of 
the line integral for work. 

Perhaps you've seen in physics,  the work done by, say, the electrical force,  is 
actually given by the change in the va lue of a potential from the starting point of the 
end ing point, or same for gravitationa l force. So, these are specia l cases of what's 
called the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals. So,  the fundamental 
theorem of calculus, not for line integra ls, tells you if you integrate a derivative, then 
you get back the function. 

And here, it's the same thing in multivariable calculus. It tells you, if you take the 
line integra l of the grad ient of a  function, what you get back  is the function. OK, so -
- -- the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integra ls -- -- says if you integrate 
a vector field that's the gradient of a function along a curve, let's say that you have a 
curve that goes from some starting point, P0, 

to some ending point, P1. All you will get is the value of F at P1 minus the va lue of F 
at P0. OK, so, that's a pretty nifty formula that only works if the field that you are 
integrating is a gradient. You know it's a grad ient, and you know the function, little f. 
I mean, we can't put just any vector field in here. We have to put the gradient of F. 
So, actua lly on Tuesday we'll see how to decide whether a vector field is a grad ient 
or not, 

and if it is a grad ient, how to  find the potential function. So, we'll cover that. But,  for 
now we need to try to figure out a bit more about this, what it says, what it means 
physically, how to think of it geometrically, and so on. So, maybe I should say, if 
you're trying to write this  in coordinates, because that's a lso a useful way to think 
about it, if I g ive you the line integra l along C, 

so, the gradient field, the components are f sub x and f sub y. So, it means I'm 
actually integrating f sub x dx plus f sub y dy. Or, if you prefer, that's the same thing 
as actually integrating df. So, I'm integrating the d ifferential of a  function, f. Well 
then, that's the change in F. And, of course, if you write it in this form, then probably 
it's quite obvious to you that this should be true. 

I mean, in this form, actua lly it's the same statement as  in single variable ca lculus. 
OK, and actually that's how we prove the theorem. So, let's prove this theorem. How 
do we prove it? Well, let's say I give you a curve and I ask you to compute this 
integral. How w ill you do that? Well, the way you compute the integral actua lly is by 
choosing a parameter, and expressing everything in terms of that parameter. 

So, we'll set, well, so we know it's f sub x dx plus f sub y dy. And, we'll want to 
parameterize C in the form x equals x of t. y equals y of t. So, if we do that, then dx 
becomes x prime of t dt. dy becomes y prime of t dt. So, we know x is x of t. That 
tells us dx is x prime of t dt. y is y of t g ives us dy is y prime of t dt. So, now what 
we are integrating actually becomes the integral of f sub x times dx dt p lus f sub y 
times dy dt times dt. 

OK, but now, here I recognize a familiar guy. I've seen this one before in the cha in 
rule. OK, this guy, by the chain rule, is the rate of change of f if I take x and y to be 
functions of t. And, I p lug those  into f. So, in fact, what I'm integrating is d f dt when 
I think of f as a  function of t by just plugg ing x and y as functions of t. And so maybe 
actually I should now say I have sometimes t goes from some initia l time, let's say, t 
zero to t one. 

And now, by the usual fundamental theorem of calculus, I know that this w ill be just 
the change  in the va lue of f between t zero and  t one. OK, so integra l from t zero to 
one of (df /dt) dt, well, that becomes f between t zero and t one. f of what? We just 
have to be a little bit careful here. Well, it's not quite f of t. It's f seen as a  function 
of t by putting x of t and y of t into it. 

So, let me read that carefully. What I'm  integrating to is f of x of t and y of t. Does 
that sound fair? Yeah, and so, when I p lug in t1, I get the point where I am at time 
t1. That's the endpoint of my curve. When I p lug t0, I will get the starting point of 
my curve, p0. And, that's the end of the proof. It wasn't that hard, see? OK, so  let's 
see an example. Well, let's look at that examp le again. 

So, we have this curve. We have this vector field. Could it be that, by accident, that 
vector field was a grad ient field? So, remember, our vector field was y, x. Can we 
think of a  function whose derivative with respect to x is y, and derivative w ith 
respect to y is x? Yeah, x times y sounds  like a good cand idate where f( x, y) is xy. 
OK, so  that means that the  line integrals that we computed a long these things can 
be just eva luated  from just finding out the values of f at the endpoint? 

So, here's version two of my p lot where I've added the contour plot of a function, x, 
y on top of the vector field. Actua lly, they have a vector field is still pointing 
perpendicular to the level curves that we have seen, just to remind you. And, so 
now, when we move, now when we move, the orig in is on the level curve, f equa ls 
zero. And, when we start going along C1, we stay on f equals zero. 

So, there's no work. The potentia l doesn't change. Then on C2, the potentia l 
increases from zero to one ha lf. The work is one half. And then, on C3, we go back 

down from one half to zero. The work is negative one half. See, that was much 
easier than computing. So, for example, the integral along C2 is actually just, so, C2 
goes from one zero to one over root two, one over root two. So, that's one half 
minus zero, and that's one half, OK, because C2 was going here. 

And, at this point, f is zero. At that point, f  is one half. And, similarly for the others, 
and of course when you sum, you get zero because the total change in f when you 
go from here, to here, to here, to here, eventually you are back at the same place. 
So, f hasn't changed. OK, so that's a neat trick. And it's important conceptua lly 
because a lot of the forces are gradients of potentia ls, namely, gravitational force, 
electric force. 

The problem is not every vector field is a grad ient. A lot of vector fields are not 
gradients. For example, magnetic fields certa inly are not gradients. So -- -- a big 
warning: everything today only applies if F is a gradient field. OK, it's not true 
otherwise. OK, still, let's see, what are the consequences of the fundamenta l 
theorem? So, just to put one more time this disclaimer, if F is a grad ient field -- --
then what do we have? 

Well, there's various nice features of work done by gradient fields that are not too far 
off the vector fields. So, one of them is this property of path independence. OK, so 
the cla im is if I have a line integra l to compute,  that it doesn't matter which path I 
take as long as it goes from point a to point b. It just depends on the point where I 
start and the point where I end. And, that's certainly fa lse in general, but for a 
gradient field that works. 

So if I have a point, P0, a point, P1, and I have two d ifferent paths that go there, 
say, C1 and C2, so they go from the same point to the same point but in different 
ways, then in this situation,  the line integral along C1 is equa l to the line integra l 
along C2. Well, actua lly, let me insist that this is only for grad ient fields by putting 
gradient F in here, just so you don't get tempted to ever use this for a field that's not 
a grad ient field -- -- if C1 and C2 have the same start and end point. 

OK, how do you prove that? Well,  it's very easy. We just use the fundamental 
theorem. It tells us, if you compute the line integral along C1, it's just F at this point 
minus F at this point. If you do it for C2, well, the same. So, they are the same. And 
for that you don't actually even need to know what little f is. You know in advance 
that it's going to be the same. So, if I g ive you a vector field and I tell you it's the 
gradient of mysterious function but I don't tell you what the function is and you don't 
want to  find out, 

you can still use path independence, but only if you know it's a gradient. OK, I guess 
this one is dead. So, that will stay here forever because nobody is ta ll enough to 
erase it. When you come back next year and you still see that formula, you'll see. 
Yes, but there's no useful information here. That's a good point. OK, so what's 
another consequence? So, if you have a grad ient field, it's what's called 
conservative. 

OK, so what a conservative field? Well, the word conservative comes from the idea in 
physics; if the conservation of energy. It tells you that you cannot get energy for 
free out of your force field. So, what it means is that in particular, if you take a 
closed trajectory, so a trajectory that goes from some point back to the same point, 
so, if C is a closed curve, then the work done along C -- -- is zero. 

OK, that's the definition of what it means to be conservative. If I take any closed

curve,  the work will always be zero. On the contrary, not conservative means

somewhere there is a curve a long which the work is not zero. If you  find a curve

where the work is zero, that's not enough to say it's conservative. You have show

that no matter what curve I g ive you, if it's a closed curve, it will always be zero.


So, what that means concretely is if you have a force field that conservative,  then

you cannot build somehow some perpetua l motion out of it. You can't build

something that w ill just keep going just powered by that force because that force is

actually not providing any energy. After you've gone one loop around, nothings

happened  from the point of view of the energy provided by that force. There's no

work coming from the force,


while if you have a force field that's not conservative than you can try to actually

maybe find a loop where the work would be positive. And then, you know, that thing

will just keep running. So actually,  if you just look at magnetic fields and

transformers or power adapters, and things  like that, you precisely extract energy

from the magnetic field. Of course, I mean, you actually have to take some power

supply to maintain the magnetic fields.


But, so a magnetic field, you could actua lly try to get energy from it a lmost for free.

A gravitational field or an electric field, you can't. OK, so and now why does that

hold? Well,  if I have a gradient field, then if I try to compute this line integral, I know

it will be the value of the function at the end point minus the va lue at the starting

point. But, they are the same. So, the va lue is the same.


So, if I have a grad ient field, and  I do the line  integral, then I w ill get f at the

endpoint minus f at the starting point. But, they're the same point, so that's zero.

OK, so just to reinforce my warning that not every field is a grad ient field, let's  look

again at our favorite vector field from yesterday. So, our favorite vector field

yesterday was negative y and x. It's a vector field that just rotates around the origin

counterclockwise.


Well, we said, say you take just the unit circle -- -- for examp le, counterclockw ise.

Well, remember we said yesterday that the line  integral of F dr, maybe I should say

F dot T ds now, because the vector field is tangent to the circle. So, on the unit

circle, F is tangent to the curve. And so, F dot T is length F times, well, length T. But,

T is a unit vector. So, it's length F. And, the length of F on the unit circle was just

one.


So, that's the integra l of 1 ds. So, it's just the length of the circle that's 2 pi. And 2 pi

is definitely not zero. So, this vector field is not conservative. And so, now we know

actually it's not the gradient of anything because if it were a grad ient, then it would

be conservative and it's not. So, it's an example of a vector field that is not

conservative. It's not path independent either by the way because,


see,  if I go  from here to here along the upper half circle or along the lower ha lf

circle, in one case I w ill get p i. In the other case I will get negative pi. I don't get the

same answer, and so on, and so on. It just fa ils to have all of these properties. So,

maybe I will write that down. It's not conservative, not path independent. It's not a

gradient. It doesn't have any of these properties.


OK, any questions? Yes? How do you determine whether something is a gradient or 
not? Well,  that's what we will see on Tuesday. Yes? Is it possib le that it's 
conservative and not path independent, or vice versa? The answer is no; these two 
properties are equiva lent, and we are going to see that right now. At least that's the 
plan. OK, yes? Let's see, so you said if it's not path independent, then we cannot 
draw level curves that are perpendicular to it at every point. 

I wouldn't necessarily go that far. You might be able to draw curves that are 
perpendicular to it. But they won't be the level curves of a function for which this is 
the gradient. I mean, you might still have, you know, if you take, say, take his 
gradient field and scale it that in strange ways, you know, multip ly by two in some 
places, by one in other places, by five and some other places, 

you will get something that won't be conservative anymore. And it will still be 
perpendicular to the curves. So, it's more subtle than that, but certainly  if it's not 
conservative then it's not a grad ient, and you cannot do what we said. And how to 
decide whether it  is or not, they'll be Tuesday's topic. So, for now, I just want to 
figure out aga in actua lly, let's now state a ll these properties -- Actually, let me first 
do one minute of physics. 

So, let me just tell you again what's the physics in here. So, it's a force field is the 
gradient of a potentia l -- -- so, I'll still keep my plus signs. So, maybe I should say 
this is minus physics. [LAUGHTER] So, the work of F is the change in value of 
potential from one endpoint to the other endpoint. [PAUSE ] And -- -- so, you know, 
you might know about gravitational fields, or electrical -- -- fields versus 
gravitational -- -- or electrical potentia l. 

And, in case you haven't done any 8.02 yet, electrical potential is also commonly 
known as voltage. It's the one that makes it hurt when you stick your fingers into 
the socket. [LAUGHTER] Don't try it. OK, and so now, conservativeness means no 
energy can be extracted for free -- -- from the field. You can't just have, you know, a 
particle moving in that field and going on in definitely,  faster and  faster, or if there's 
actually friction, 

then keep moving. So, tota l energy is conserved. And, I guess, that's why we call 
that conservative. OK, so let's end w ith the recap of various equiva lent properties. 
OK, so  the first property that I w ill have for a vector field is that it's conservative. 
So, to say that a vector field with conservative means that the line integral is zero 
along any closed curve. Maybe to clarify, sorry, along all closed curves, OK, every 
closed curve; 

give me any closed curve, I get zero. So, now I cla im this is the same thing as a 
second property, which is that the line  integral of F is path independent. OK, so that 
means  if I have two paths w ith the same endpoint, then I w ill get a lways the same 
answer. Why is that equiva lent? Well, let's say that I am path independent. If I am 
path independent, then if I take a closed curve, well, it has the same endpoints as 
just the curve that doesn't move at all. 

So, path independence tells me instead of going all around, I could just stay where I 
am. And then, the work would just be zero. So,  if I path independent, tonight 
conservative. Conversely, let's say that I'm just conservative and I want to check 
path independence. Well, so I have two points, and then I had to paths between 
that. I want to show that the work is the same. Well, how  I do  that? 

C1 and C2, well, I observe that if I do C1 minus C2, I get a closed path. If I go  first 
from here to here, and then back along that one, I get a closed path. So, if I am 
conservative, I should get zero. But, if I get zero on C1 minus C2, it means that the 
work on C1 and the work on C2 are the same. See, so  it's the same. It's just a 
different way to think about the situation. More things that are equiva lent, I have 
two more things to say. 

The third one, it's equivalent to F being a grad ient field. OK, so this is equiva lent to 
the third property. F is a gradient field. Why? Well, if we know that it's a grad ient 
field,  that we've seen that we get these properties out of the fundamenta l theorem. 
The question is, if I have a conservative, or path independent vector field, why is it 
the gradient of something? OK, so this way is a  fundamenta l theorem. 

That way, well, so that actua lly, let me just say that will be how we find the 
potential. So, how do we find potentia l? Well, let's say that I know the value of my 
potential here. Actua lly, I get to choose what it is. Remember, in physics, the 
potential is defined up to adding or subtracting a constant. What matters is only the 
change in potential. So, let's say I know my potential here and I want to know my 
potential here. 

What do I do? Well, I take my favorite particle and I move  it from here to here. And, 
I look at the work done. And that tells me how much potentia l has changed. So, that 
tells me what the potential should be here. And, this does not depend on my choice 
of path because I've assumed that I'm path independence. So, that's who we will do 
on Tuesday. And, let me just state the fourth property that's the same. 

So, all that stuff is the same as also four. If I look at M dx N dy is what's called an 
exact d ifferential. So, what that means, an exact differentia l, means that it can be 
put in the form d f for some function,  f, and just reformulating this thing, right, 
because I'm saying I can just put it in the form f sub x dx plus f sub y dy, which 
means my vector field was a gradient field. So, these things are rea lly the same. 

OK, so after the weekend, on Tuesday we will actually figure out how to decide 
whether these things hold or not, and how to  find the potential.
