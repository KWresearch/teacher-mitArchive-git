18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 7 

OK. Let's get started, p lease. First, I wanted to remind you that tomorrow is the first 
exam in this class. It is taking place here if your last name starts with S or beyond, 
and it is taking place in Walker top floor if your last name starts from A-R. If you are 
left-handed and you prefer to have a real tab le, feel free to go to Walker. Otherwise, 
try to go to the correct room. It is better. 

And, well, let's see. We w ill be basica lly grad ing  the exam in the afternoon evening 
and then posting the scores on the online system, so you can check there. And there 
will be makeup exams on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday next week. For times 
and places, I will announce on the Web page. That is in case things don't go well or 
in case somehow you cannot make it tomorrow. Remember, if you have an absence 
for like a sports tournament or something like this, please let us know now. What 
else? Hopefully you have seen the two practice exams. And one of them you 
probably ta lked about in recitation yesterday. The other one we are going to see a 
bit now. I have had some of you comment that the practice exams are much easier 
than the problem sets. 

And, well, let's say the problem sets are harder than the exams because they are 
designed to make you think and to truly help you put things together, see how you 
would use the concepts in a real world situation. The exams are a b it easier. The 
actual exam is comparab le to the practice exams in difficulty. It is a little bit, maybe 
a tiny, tiny bit harder, especia lly when practice exam 1B was a little bit on the easier 
side of thing, but not much harder. 

So, if you do  fine on the practice exams, you should do fine tomorrow. As you have 
seen, the format is basically five or six prob lems that cover a ll the materia l we have 
seen. And, well, there is a bit of everything. Some of the problems are very easy and 
shouldn't take more than a minute or two to finish. Some of those will take a bit 
more thinking. Remember, you only have 50 minutes so you have to think about 
how to use your time. 

The exam is designed so that most of you can  finish it in 50 minutes, but don't stay 
stuck on the same problem  for a half an hour. Switch to the next page. Let me just 
tell you first about the list of top ics. Basica lly, the list of top ics is simp le. It is 
everything. I mean, everything we have seen so far is on the exam. But let me just 
remind you of the main topics that we have seen. F irst of all, we learned about 
vectors, how to use them, and dot-product. At this point, you probab ly should know 
that the dot-product of two vectors is obta ined by summing products of components. 

And geometrica lly it is the length of A times the length of B times the cosine of the 
angle between them. And, in particular, we can use dot-product to measure angles 
by solving for cosine theta in this equality. And most importantly to detect whether 
two vectors are perpend icular to each other. Two vectors are perpendicular when 
their dot-product  is zero. Any questions about that? No. Is everyone reasonab ly 
happy with dot-product by now? I see a stunned silence. Nobody happy w ith dot-

product so far? OK. If you want to look at Practice 1A, a good example of a typical 
problem w ith dot-product would be prob lem 1. 

Let's see. We are going to go over the practice exam when I am done writing this list 
of top ics. I think probably we actually will skip this prob lem because I think most of 
you know how to do it. And if not then you should run for help from me or from your 
recitation instructor to figure out how to do it. The second topic that we saw was 
cross-product. When you have two vectors in space, you can just form that cross-
product by computing its determinant. So, imp licitly, we should also know about 
determinants. 

By that I mean two by two and three by three. Don't worry about larger ones, even if 
you are interested, they won't be on the test. And applications of cross-product, for 
example,  find ing the area of a triangle or a para llelogram in space. If you have a 
triangle in space w ith sides A and B then its area is one-ha lf of the length of A cross 
B. Because the length of A cross B is length A, length B sine theta, which is the same 
as the area of the para llelogram formed by these two vectors. And the other 
application of cross-product is to find a vector that's perpendicular to two given 
vectors. In particular, to find the vector that is normal to a plane and then find the 
equation of a plane. 

Another app lication is finding the normal vector to a plane and using that finding the 
equation of a plane. Basica lly, remember, to find the equation of a p lane, ax by cz = 
d, what you need is the normal vector to the plane. And the components of the 
normal vector are exactly the coefficients that go into this. And we have seen an 
argument for why that happens to be the case. To find a norma l vector to a plane 
typica lly what we will do is take two vectors that lie in the plane and will take their 
cross-product. And the cross-product w ill automatically be perpendicular to both of 
them. We are going to see an example of that when we look at prob lem 5 in practice 
1A. I think we w ill try to do  that one. 

Another app lication, well, we w ill just mention it as a top ic that goes a long w ith this 
one. We have seen also about equations of  lines and how to find where a line 
intersects a p lane. Just to refresh your memories, the equation of a line, well, we w ill 
be looking at parametric equations. To know the parametric equation of a line, we 
need to know a point on the line and we need to know a vector that is para llel to the 
line. And, if we know a point on the line and a vector along the line, then we can 
express the parametric equations for the motion of a point that is moving on the line. 

Actually, starting at point, at time zero, and moving w ith velocity v. To put things in 
symbolic form, you w ill get a position of that point by starting with a position of time 
zero and add ing t times the vector v. It gives you x, y and z in terms of t. And that is 
how we represent lines. We w ill look at problem 5 in a b it, but any general questions 
about these top ics? No. Do you have a question? Do we have to know Taylor series? 
That  is a good question. No, not on the exam. [APPLAUSE] 

Taylor series are something you should be aware of, generally speaking. It will be 
useful for you in rea l life, probably not when you go to the supermarket, but if you 
solve engineering prob lems you w ill need Taylor series. It would be good not to 
forget them entirely, but on the 18.02 exams they probab ly won't be there. Let me 
continue w ith more topics. And then we can see  if you can think of other topics that 
should or should not be on the exam. Third top ics would be matrices, linear systems, 
inverting matrices. 

I know that most of you that have ca lculators that can invert matrices, but still you 
are expected at this point to know how to do it by hand. If you have looked at the 
practice tests, both of them have a problem that asks you to invert a matrix or at 
least do part of it. And so it is very likely that tomorrow there w ill be a prob lem like 
that as well. In genera l, when a kind of problem is on both practice tests it's a good 
indication that it might be there also on the actual exam. 

Unfortunately, not with the same matrix so you cannot learn the answer by heart. 
Another thing that we have learned about, well, I should say this is going to be 
problem 3 on the test and w ill on the practice test. On the actua l test, too, I think, 
actually. Anyway, we will come back to it later. A coup le of things that you should 
remember. If you have a system of the form AX equals B then there are two cases. 
If a determinant of A is not zero then that means you can compute the inverse 
matrix and you can just solve by taking A inverse times B. And the other case is 
when the determinant of A is zero, and there is either no solution or there is infinitely 
many solutions. 

In particular, if you know that there is a solution, for examp le, if B  is zero there 
always is an obvious solution, X equa ls zero, then you will actually have infinitely 
many. In general, we don't really know how to tell whether it  is no solution or 
infinitely many. Questions about that? Yes? Will we have to know how to rotate 
vectors and so on? Not in genera l, but you might still want to remember how to 
rotate a vector in a p lane by 90 degrees because that has been useful when we have 
done problems about parametric equations, which is what I am coming to next. 

What we have seen about rotation matrices, that was the homework part B prob lem, 
you are not supposed to remember by heart everything that was in part B of your 
homework. It is a good idea to have some vague knowledge because it is useful 
culture, I would say, useful background for later in your lives, but I won't ask you by 
heart to know what is the formation for a rotation matrix. And then we come to, last 
by not least, the prob lem of finding parametric equations. 

And, in particular, possibly by decomposing the position vector into a sum of simpler 
vectors. You have seen quite an evil exam of that on the last problem set with this 
picture that maybe by now you have had some nightmares about. Anyway, the one 
on the exam w ill certainly be easier than that. But, as you have seen -- I mean, you 
should know, basically, how to ana lyze a motion that is being described to you and 
express  it in terms of vectors and then  figure out what the parametric equation w ill 
be. Now, again, it won't be as comp licated on the exam as the one in the problem 
set. But there are a couple of those on the practice exam, so that gives you an  idea 
of what  is realistically expected of you. 

And now once we have parametric equations for motion, so that means when we 
know how to find the position vector as a  function of a parameter maybe of time, 
then we have seen also about velocity and acceleration, which the vector is obtained 
by taking the first and second derivatives of a position vector. And so one topic that I 
will add in there as well is somehow how to prove things about motions by 
differentiating vector identities. 

One example of that,  for examp le, is when we try to look at Kepler's law in class  last 
time. We look at Kepler's second law of p lanetary motion, and we reduced it to a 
calculation about a derivative of the cross-product R cross v. Now, on the exam you 

don't need to know the deta ils of Kepler's law, but you need to be able to manipulate 
vector quantities a bit in the way that we did. And so on practice exam 1A, you 
actually have a variety of problems on this topics because you have problems two, 
four and six, a ll about parametric motions. 

Probab ly tomorrow there will not be three distinct problems about parametric 
motions, but maybe a couple of them. I think that is basically the  list of topics. 
Anybody spot something that I have forgotten to put on the exam or questions about 
something that should or should not be there? You go first. Yeah? How about 
parametrizing weird trigonometric functions? I am not sure what you mean by that. 
Well, parametric curves, you need to know how  to parameterize motions, and that 
involves a little b it of trigonometrics. When we have seen these prob lems about 
rotating wheels, say the cycloid, for example, and so on there is a bit of cosine and 
sine and so on. 

I think not much more on that. You won't need obscure trigonometric  identities. 
You're next. Any proofs on the exam or just like problems? Well, a problem can ask 
you to show things. It is not going to be a complicated proof. The proofs are going to 
be fa irly easy. If you look at practice 1A, the last problem does have a little bit of 
proof. 6B says that show  that blah, blah, b lah. But, as you will see,  it is not a difficult 
kind of proof. So, about the same. Yes? Are there equations of 3D shapes that we 
should know at this point? We should know definitely a lot about the equations of 
planes on lines. And you should probably know that a sphere centered at the orig in is 
the set of points where distance to  the center is equa l to the radius of the sphere. 

We don't need more at this point. As the semester goes on, we will start seeing 
cones and things like that. But at this point p lanes, lines. And maybe you need to 
know about circles and spheres, but nothing beyond that. More questions? Yes? If 
there is a formula that you have proved on the homework then, yes, you can assume 
it on the test. Maybe you want to write on your test that this is a  formula you have 
seen in homework just so that we know that you remember it from homework and 
not from looking over your neighbor's shoulder or whatever. Yes, it is OK to use 
things that you know genera l-speaking. That being said,  for examp le, probab ly there 
will be a  linear system to solve. 

It will say on the exam you are supposed to solve that using matrices, not by 
elimination. There are things like that. If a problem says solve by using vector 
methods, things like that, then try to use at least a vector somewhere. But, in 
general, you are a llowed to use things that you know. Yes? Will we need to go from 
parametric equations to xy equations? Well, let's say only if it is very easy. If I g ive 
you a parametric curve, sin t, sin t, then you should be ab le to observe that it is on 
the line y equa ls x, not beyond that. Yes? Do we have to use --

Yes. I don't know if you will have to use  it, but certainly you should know a little bit 
about the unit tangent vector. Just remember the main thing to know that the unit 
tangent vector is velocity d ivided by the speed. I mean there is not much more to it 
when you think about it. Yes? Kepler's law, well, you are allowed to use it if it helps 
you,  if you find a way to squeeze it in. You don't have to know Kep ler's law in detail. 
You just have to know how to reproduce the general steps. If I tell you R cross v is 
constant, you might be expected to know what to do with that. I would say --

Basica lly, you don't need to know Kep ler's law. You need to know the kind of stuff 
that we saw when we derived it such as how to take the derivative of a dot-product 

or a cross-product. That is basica lly the answer. I don't see any questions anymore. 
Oh, you are raising your hand. Yes. How to ca lculate the distance between two lines 
and the d istance between two planes? Well, you have seen, probably recently,  that it 
is quite pa inful to do in general. And, no, I don't think that w ill be on the exam by 
itself. You need to know how to compute the distance between two points. That 
certainly you need to know. And also maybe how to  find the compliment of a vector 
in a certain d irection. And that is about it, I would say. I mean the more you know 
about things the better. 

Things that come up on part Bs of the problem sets are interesting things, but they 
are usually not needed on the exams. If you have more questions then you are not 
raising your hand high enough  for me to see it. OK. Let's try to do a bit of this 
practice exam 1A. Hopefully, everybody has it. If you don't have it, hopefully your 
neighbor has it. If you don't have  it and your neighbor doesn't have it then please 
raise your hand. I have a coup le. 

If you neighbor has  it then just follow with them for now. I think there are a few 
people behind you over there. I will stop handing them out now. If you really need 
one, it is on the website,  it will be here at the end of class. Let's see. Well, I think we 
are going to just skip prob lems 1 and 2 because they are pretty stra ightforward and 
I hope that you know how to do them. I mean I don't know. 

Let's see. How many of you have no problem w ith prob lem 1? How many of you have 
trouble with problem 1? OK. How many of you haven't raised your hands? OK. How 
many of you have trouble with problem 2? OK. Well, if you have questions about 
those, maybe you should just come see me at the end because that is probab ly more 
efficient that way. I am going to start right away w ith prob lem 3, actua lly. 

Prob lem 3 says we have a matrix given to us |1 3 2; 2 0 - 1; 1 1 0|. And it tells us 
determinant of A is 2 and inverse equals something, but we are missing two values A 
and B and we are supposed to find them. That means we need to do the steps of the 
algorithm to find the inverse of A. We are told that A inverse is one-ha lf of |1 ... ...; -
1 - 2 5; 2 2 - 6|. And here there are two unknown values. 

Remember, to invert a matrix, first we compute the minors. Then we flip some signs 
to get the cofactors. Then we transpose. And, finally, we d ivide by the determinant. 
Let's try to be smart about this. Do we need to compute all nine minors? No. We only 
need to compute two of them, right? Which minors do we need to compute? Here 
and here or here and here? Yeah, that looks better. Because, remember, we need to 
transpose things so these two guys will end up here. I claim we should compute 
these two minors. And we w ill see  if that is good enough. If you start doing others 
and you  find that they don't end up in the right place then just do more, but you 
don't need to spend your time computing a ll nine of them. If you are worried about 
not doing it right then, of course, you can maybe compute one or two more to just 
double-check your answers. 

But let us just do those that we think are needed. The matrix of minors. The one that 
goes in the middle position is obtained by deleting this row and that column, and we 
are left w ith a determinant |3 2;1 0|, 3 times 0 minus 1 times 2 should be - 2 should 
be - 2. Then the one in the lower left corner, we delete the last row and the first 
column, we are left w ith |3 2; 0 - 1|. 3 times (- 1) is negative 3 minus 0. We are still 
left with negative three. Is that step clear for everyone? Then we need  to go to 
cofactors. That means we need to change signs. The rule is --

We change signs in basically these four p laces. That means we will be left w ith 
positive 2 and negative 3. Then we take the transpose. That means the first column 
will copy into the first row, so this guy we still don't know, but here we will have two 
and here we will have minus three. Fina lly, we have to d ivide by the determinant of 
A. And here we are actua lly told that the determinant of A is two. 

So we will divide by two. But there is only one-half here so actua lly it is done for us. 
The va lues that we will put up there are going to be 2 and negative 3. Now let's see 
how we use that to solve a linear system. If we have to solve a linear system, Ax 
equa ls B, well, if the matrix is  invertible, its determinant is not zero, so we can 
certainly write x equals A inverse B. So we have to multip ly, that is one-ha lf | 1 2 -
3; - 1 - 2 5; 2 2 - 6|. 

Times B [ 1, - 2, 1]. Remember, to do a matrix multip lication you take the rows  in 
here, the columns in here and you do dot-products. The first entry will be one times 
one plus two times minus two plus minus three times one, one minus four minus 
three should be negative six, except I still have, of course, a one-ha lf in front. Then 
minus one p lus four plus five should be 8. Two minus four minus six should be -8. 
That w ill simplify to [- 3, 4, - 5]. Any questions about that? 

OK. Now we come to part C which is the harder part of this problem. It says let's 
take this matrix A and let's rep lace the two in the upper right corner by some other 
number C. That means we w ill  look at 1 3 C; 2 0 - 1; 1 1 0|. And let's ca ll that M. 
And it first asks you to find the value of C  for which this matrix is not invertible. M is 
not invertible exactly when the determinant of M is zero. Let's compute the 
determinant. 

Well, we should do one times that smaller determinant, which is zero minus negative 
one, which is 1 times 1 minus three times that determinant, which is zero plus one is 
1. And then we have p lus C times the lower left determinant which is two times one 
minus zero is 2. That gives us one minus three is - 2 2C. That is zero when C equals 
1. For C equals 1, this matrix is not invertib le. For other values it is invertible. It 
goes on to say  let's look at this value of C and let's look at the system Mx equals 
zero. I am going to put value one in there. 

Now, if we look at Mx equals zero, well, this has either no solution or infinitely many 
solutions. But here there is an obvious solution. Namely x equals zero is a solution. 
Maybe let me rewrite it more geometrically. X 3 y z = 0. 2x - z = 0. And x y = 0. You 
see we have an obvious solution, (0, 0, 0). But we have more solutions. How do we 
find more solutions? Well, (x, y, z) is a solution if it is in all three of these planes. 
That  is a way to think about it. 

Probab ly we are actua lly in this situation where, in  fact, we have three planes that 
are a ll passing through the orig in and all para llel to the same line. And so that would 
be the line of solutions. To find it actua lly we can think of this as follows. The first 
observation is that actually in this situation we don't need all three equations. The 
fact that the system has infinitely many solutions means that actually one of the 
equations is redundant. If you look at it long enough you will see, for example,  if you 
multip ly three times this equation and you subtract that one then you w ill get the 
first equation. Three times (x y) - (2x - z) will be x 3y z. 

Now, we don't actua lly need to see that to solve a prob lem. I am just show ing you 
that is what happens when you have a matrix with determinant zero. One of the 
equations is somehow a dup licate of the others. We don't actually need to  figure out 
how exactly. What that means is really we want to solve, let's say start w ith two of 
the equations. To  find the solution we can observe that the first equation says 
actually that <x, y, z> dot-product with <1, 3, 1> =0. And the second equation says 
<x, y, z> dot-product w ith <2, 0,- 1>  is zero. And the third equation, if we rea lly 
want to keep it, says we should be also having this. 

Now, these equations now written like this, they are just saying we want an x, y, z 
that is perpend icular to these vectors. Let's forget this one and let's just look at 
these two. They are saying we want a vector that is perpendicular to these two g iven 
vectors. How do we find that? We do  the cross-product. To  find x, y, z perpendicular 
to <1, 3, 1> and <2, 0, - 1>, we take the cross-product. And that will give us 
something. Well, let me just give you the answer. I am sure you know how to do 
cross-products by now. I don't have the answer here, so I guess I have to do it. 

That should be <- 3, probab ly positive 3, and then - 6>. That is the solution. And 
any multiple of that  is a solution. If you like to neatly simplify them you could say 
negative one, one, negative two. If you like  larger numbers you can multip ly that by 
a million. That is a lso a solution. Any questions about that? Yes? That is correct. If 
you pick these two guys instead, you w ill get the same solution. Well, up to a 
multip le. It could be if you do  the cross-product of these two guys you actually get 
something that is a multiple --

Actually, I think if you do the cross-product of the first and third one you w ill get 
actually minus one, one, minus two, the sma ller one. But it doesn't matter. I mean  it 
is rea lly in the same direction. This is all because a p lane has actually normal vectors 
of all sizes. Yes? I don't think so because -- An important thing to remember about 
cross-product is we compute for minors, but then we put a minus sign on the second 
component. The coefficient of j in here, the second component, you do one times 
minus two times one. That is negative three  indeed. But then you actua lly change 
that to a positive three. Yes? 

Well, we don't have parametric equations here. Oh, solving by elimination. Well, if it 
says that you have to use vector methods then you should use vector methods. If it 
says you should use vectors and matrices then you are expected to do it that way. 
Yes? It depends what the prob lem is asking. The question is, is it enough to  find the 
components of a vector or do we have to find the equation of a line? Here it says find 
one solution using vector operations. We have found one solution. If you wanted to 
find the line then it would all the things that are proportional to this. It would be 
maybe minus 3t, 3t minus 6t, all the multiples of that vector. 

We do because (0, 0, 0) is an obvious solution. Maybe I should write that on the 
board. You had another question? Not quite. Let me re-explain first how we get all 
the solutions and why I did that cross-product. First of all, why did I take that cross-
product aga in? I took that cross-product because I looked at my three equations and 
I observed that my three equations can be reformulated in terms of these dot-
products saying that x, y, z is actua lly perpendicular these guys and these guys have 
normal vectors to the planes. Remember, to be in all three p lanes it has to be 
perpendicular to the normal vectors. 

That  is how we got here. And now, if we want something that is perpend icular to a 
bunch of given vectors, well, to be perpendicular to two vectors, an easy way to  find 
one  is to take that cross-product. And, if you take any two of them, you will get 
something that is the same up to scaling. Now, what it means geometrically is that 
when we have our three p lanes and they a ll actually conta in the same line --

And we know that is actua lly the smae case because they a ll pass through the origin. 
They pass through the origin because the constant terms are just zero. What 
happens is that the normal vectors to  these planes are, in  fact, all perpendicular to 
that line. The norma l vectors -- Say this  line is vertica l. The normal vectors are a ll 
going to be horizonta l. Well,  it is kind of hard to draw. By taking the cross-product 
between two norma l vectors we found this direction. Now, to  find actually all the 
solutions. 

What we know so  far is that we have this d irection <-3 3 - 6>. That is going to be 
parallel to the  line of intersections. Let me do it here, for example, <3 3 - 6>. Now 
we have one particular solution. 0, 0, 0. Actually, we have found another one, too, 
which is <- 3, 3, - 6>. Anyway, if a line of solutions -- -- has parametric equation x 
= - 3t, y = 3t, z = - 6t, anything proportional to that. That is how we would find a ll 
the solutions if we wanted them. 

It is a lmost time. I think I need to jump ahead to other prob lems. Let's see. I think 
problem 4 you can probab ly find  for yourselves. It is a  reasonably straightforward 
parametric equation prob lem. You just have to find the coord inates of point P. And 
for that it is a very simp le trick. Prob lem 5. Find the area of a spaced triang le. It 
sounds like a cross-product. Find the equation of a plane a lso sounds like a cross-
product. And find the intersection of this p lane with a line means we find  first the 
parametric equation of the line and then we plug that into the equation of the plane 
to get where they intersect. Does that sound reasonab le? Who is d isparate about 
problem 5? OK. Let me repeat prob lem 5. 

First part we need to find the area of a triangle. And the way to do that is to just do 
one-half the length of a cross-product. If we have three points, P0, P1, P2 then 
maybe we can  form vectors P0P1 and P0P2. And, if we take that cross-product and 
take the length of that and d ivide by two, that w ill give us the area of a triangle. 
Here it turns out that this guy is <1, 1, 2>, if I look at the solutions, so you will end 
up with square root of 6 over 2. 

The second is asking you for the equation of a plane containing these three points. 
Well, first of all, we know that a normal vector to the p lane is going to be given by 
this cross-product again. That means that the equation of plane w ill be of a  form x 
plus y p lus 2z equals something. If a coefficient  is here it comes from the norma l 
vector. And to find what goes in the right-hand side, we just plug  in any of the 
points. If you plug  in P0, which is (2, 1, 0) then two p lus one seems like it is 3. And, 
if you want to doub le-check your answer, you can take P1 and P2 and check that you 
also get three. It is a good way to check your answer. 

Then the third part. We have a line parallel to the vector v equa ls one, one, one 
through the point S, which is (- 1, 0, 0). That means you can find its parametric 
equation. X will start at - 1, increases at rate 1. Y starts at zero, increases at rate 
one. Z starts at zero, increases at rate one. You plug these  into the plane equation, 
and that will tell you where they intersect. Is that clear? And now, in the last one 
minute, on that side I have one minute, let me just say very quickly --

Well, do you want to hear about problem 6 anyway very quickly? Yeah. OK. Problem 
6 is one of these like vector ca lculations. It says we have a position vector R. And it 
asks you how do we find the derivative of R dot R? Well, remember we have a 
product rule for taking the derivative. UV prime  is U prime V p lus UV prime. It also 
applies for dot-product. That is dR by dt dot R plus R dot dR by dt. And these are 
both the same thing. You get two R dot dR/dt, but dR/dt is v for velocity vector. 
Hopefully you have seen things like that. Now, it says show that if R has constant 
length then they are perpend icular. All you need to write basically is we assume 
length R is constant. 

That  is what it says, R has constant  length. Well, how do we get to, say, something 
we probably want to reduce to that? Well, if R  is constant in length then R dot R is 
also constant. And so that means d by dt of R dot R is zero. That is what it means to 
be constant. And so that means R dot v is zero. That means R is perpend icular to v. 
That  is a proof. It is not a scary proof. And then the last question of the exam says 
let's continue to assume that R has constant length, and let's try to find R dot v. 

If there is acceleration then probably we should bring it in somewhere, maybe by 
taking a derivative of something. If we know that R dot v equa ls zero, let's take the 
derivative of that. That is still zero. But now, using the product rule, dR/dt is v dot v 
plus R dot dv/dt is going to be zero. That means that you are asked about R dot A. 
Well, that is equa l to minus V dot V. And that is  it. Simple manipulations. Good luck 
on the exam tomorrow. I will see you tomorrow.
