Transcript â€“ Lecture 22 

OK, so  last time we've seen the curl of the vector field w ith components M and N. We 
defined that to be N sub x minus M sub y. And, we sa id this measures how far that 
vector field is from being conservative. If the curl is zero, and if the field  is defined 
everywhere, then it's going to be conservative. And so, when I take the line integral 
along a closed curve, I don't have to compute it. I notes going to be zero. 

But now, let's say that I have a general vector field. So, the curl will not be zero. 
And, I still want to compute the line integra l a long a closed curve. Well, I could 
compute it d irectly or there's another way. And that's what we are going to see 
today. So, say that I have a closed curve, C, and I want to find the work. So,  there's 
two options. One is direct calculation, and the other one is Green's theorem. 

So, Green's theorem is another way to avoid calculating line integrals if we don't 
want to. OK, so what does  it say? It says if C  is a closed curve enclosing a reg ion R 
in the plane, and  I have to  insist C should go counterclockwise. And, if I have a 
vector field that's defined and differentiable everywhere not only on the curve, C, 
which is what I need to define the line integra l, but a lso on the region inside. 

Then -- -- the line integral for the work done along C is actually equa l to a double 
integral over the region inside of curl F dA. OK, so that's the conclusion. And, if you 
want me to write it in coordinates, maybe I should do that. So, the  line integral in 
terms of the components, that's the integral of M dx plus N dy. And, the curl  is (Nx-
My)dA. OK, so that's the other way to state  it. So, that's a rea lly strange statement  if 
you think about it because the left-hand side is a line integra l. 

OK, so  the way we compute it is we take this expression Mdx Ndy and we 
parameterize the curve. We express x and y in terms of some variable, t, maybe, or 
whatever you want to ca ll it. And then, you'll do a one variab le integral over t. This 
right-hand side here, it's a double integral, dA. So, we do it the way that we learn 
how to couple of weeks ago. You take your reg ion, you slice  it in the x direction or in 
the y direction, 

and you integrate dx dy after setting up the bounds carefully, or maybe in polar 
coordinates r dr d theta. But, see, the way you compute these things is completely 
different. This one on the  left-hand side lives only on the curve, while the right-hand 
side lives everywhere in this region inside. So, here, x and y are related,  they live on 
the curve. Here, x and y are independent. There just are some bounds between 
them. 

And, of course, what you're integrating is d ifferent. It's a line integra l for work. Here, 
it's a double integra l of some function of x and y. So, it's a very perplexing 
statement at first. But,  it's a very powerful tool. So, we're going to try to see how  it 
works concretely, what it says, what are the consequences, how we could convince 
ourselves that, yes, this works, and so on. That's going to be the topic for today. 

Any questions about the statement first? No? OK, yeah, one remark, sorry. So, here, 
it stays counterclockw ise. What if I have a curve that goes clockwise? Well, you could 
just take the negative, and integrate counterclockw ise. Why does the theorem 
choose counterclockw ise over clockwise? How doesn't know that it's counterclockw ise 
rather than clockwise? Well, the answer is basically in our convention  for curl. 

See, we've said curl is Nx minus My, and not the other way around. And, that's a 
convention as well. So, somehow, the two conventions match with each other. That's 
the best answer I can g ive you. So, if you met somebody from a different p lanet, 
they might have Green's theorem w ith the opposite conventions, w ith curves going 
clockwise, and the curl defined the other way around. Probably if you met an alien, 
I'm not sure if you would be discussing Green's theorem first, but just in case. 

OK, so  that being said, there is a warning here which is that this is only for closed 
curves. OK, so if I give you a curve that's not closed, and I tell you, well, compute 
the line integral, then you have to do it by hand. You have to parameterize the 
curve. Or, if you really don't like that line integral, you could close the path by 
adding some other line integra l to it, and then compute using Green's theorem. 

But, you can't use Green's theorem d irectly if the curve is not closed. OK, so let's do 
a quick examp le. So, let's say that I g ive you C, the circle of radius one, centered at 
the point (2,0). So, it's out here. That's my curve, C. And,  let's say that I do it 
counterclockwise so that it w ill match with the statement of the theorem. And, let's 
say that I want you to compute the line integra l along C of ye^(-x) dx plus (one ha lf 
of x squared minus e^(-x)) dy. 

And, that's a kind of sad istic example, but maybe I'll ask you to do that. So, how 
would you do it directly? Well, to do it directly you would have to parameterize this 
curve. So that would probab ly involve setting x equa ls two p lus cosine theta y equals 
sine theta. But, I'm using as parameter of the angle around the circle, it's like the 
unit circle, the usual ones that shifted by two in the x direction. 

And then, I would set dx equa ls minus sine theta d theta. I would set dy equals 
cosine theta d theta. And, I will substitute, and I will integrate from zero to 2p i. And, 
I would probably run into a bit of troub le because I would have these e to the minus 
x, which would give me something that I rea lly don't want to integrate. So,  instead 
of doing that, which looks pretty much doomed, instead, I'm going to use Green's 
theorem. 

So, using Green's theorem, the way we'll do it  is I will, instead, compute a double 
integral. So, I will -- -- compute the doub le integral over the region inside of curl F 
dA. So, I should say probably what F was. So, let's call this M. Let's ca ll this N. And, 
then I will actua lly just choose the form coordinates, (Nx minus My) dA. And, what is 
R here? Well, R is the disk in here. OK, so, of course, it might not be that p leasant 
because we'll also have to set up this doub le  integral. 

And, for that, we'll have to figure out a way to slice this region nicely. We could do it 
dx dy. We could do it dy dx. Or, maybe we w ill want to actua lly make a change of 
variables to first shift this to the orig in, you know, change x to x minus two and then 
switch to polar coordinates. Well, let's see what happens later. OK, so what is, so 
this is R. So, what is N sub x? Well, N sub x is x plus e to the minus x minus, what is 
M sub y, e to the minus x, OK? 

This is Nx. This is My dA. Well,  it seems to simplify a bit. I will just get double 
integral over R of x dA, which looks certa inly a lot more p leasant. Of course, I made 
up the examp le  in that way so that it simp lifies when you use Green's theorem. But, 
you know,  it gives you an example where you can turn are rea lly hard line  integral 
into an easier double integral. Now, how do we compute that doub le integral? 

Well, so one way would be to set it up. Or, let's actually be a bit smarter and observe 
that this is actually the area of the region R, times the x coordinate of its center of 
mass. If I look at the definition of the center of mass, it's the average value of x. So, 
it's one over the area times the double integra l of x dA, well, possibly with the 
density, but here I'm thinking uniform density one. 

And, now, I think I know just by  looking at the picture where the center of mass of 
this circle w ill be, right? I mean, it would be right in the middle. So, that  is two, if 
you want, by symmetry. And, the area of the guy is just pi because it's a disk of 
radius one. So, I will just get 2pi. I mean, of course, if you d idn't see that,  then you 
can also compute that double integral directly. It's a nice exercise. 

But see, here, using geometry helps you to actually streamline the ca lculation. OK, 
any questions? Yes? OK, yes, let me just repeat the last part. So, I said we had to 
compute the double integra l of x dA over this region here, which is a d isk of radius 
one, centered at, this point is (2,0). So, instead of setting up the integra l w ith 
bounds and integrating dx dy or dy dx or in polar coord inates, 

I'm just going to say, well,  let's remember the definition of a center of mass. It's the 
average va lue of a  function, x in the region. So, it's one over the area of orig in times 
the double integra l of x dA. If you look, again, at the definition of x bar, it's one over 
area of doub le integra l x dA. Well, maybe if there's a density, then it's one over mass 
times doub le integral of x density dA. 

But,  if density is one, then it just becomes this. So, sw itching the area, moving the 
area to the other side, I'll get double integra l of x dA is the area of origin times the x 
coordinate of the center of mass. The area of origin is p i because it's a unit disk. 
And, the center of mass is the center of a d isk. So, its x bar is two, and I get 2 pi. 
OK, that I d idn't actually have to do this in my examp le today, but of course that 
would be good review. 

It will remind you of center of mass and a ll that. OK, any other questions? No? OK, 
so let's see, now that we've seen how to use it practice, how to avoid ca lculating the 
line integra l if we don't want to. Let's try to convince ourselves that this theorem 
makes sense. OK, so, well, let's start with an easy case where we should be ab le to 
know the answer to both sides. So let's look at the specia l case. 

Let's look at the case where curl F is zero. Then, well, we'd like to conclude that F is 
conservative. That's what we sa id. Well let's see what happens. So, Green's theorem 
says that if I have a closed curve, then the line integra l of F is equal to the double 
integral of curl on the reg ion inside. And, if the curl is zero, then I w ill be integrating 
zero. I will get zero. OK, so this is actua lly how you prove that if your vector field has 
curve zero, then  it's conservative. 

OK, so  in particular, if you have a vector field that's defined everywhere the plane, 
then you take any closed curve. Well, you w ill get that the line integra l will be zero. 
Straightly speaking, that w ill only work here if the curve goes counterclockwise. But 

otherwise, just look at the various loops that it makes, and orient each of them 
counterclockwise and sum things together. So let me state that again. 

So, OK, so a consequence of Green's theorem is that if F is defined everywhere in 
the p lane -- -- and the curl of F is zero everywhere, then F is conservative. And so, 
this actua lly is the input we needed to justify our criterion. The test that we saw last 
time saying, well, to check if something is a gradient field if it's conservative, we just 
have to compute the curl and check whether it's zero. 

OK, so how do we prove that now carefully? Well, you just take a closed curve in the 
plane. You sw itch the orientation if needed so it becomes counterclockwise. And then 
you look at the reg ion inside. And then you know that the line integra l inside will be 
equa l to the doub le integral of curl, which is the double integra l of zero. Therefore, 
that's zero. But see, OK, so now let's say that we try to do that for the vector field 
that was on your prob lems that was not defined at the origin. 

So if you've done the problem sets and found the same answers that I d id, then you 
will have found that this vector field had curve zero everywhere. But still it wasn't 
conservative because if you went around the unit circle, then you got a line integral 
that was 2pi. Or, if you compared the two halves, you got different answers for two 
parts that go from the same point to the same point. So, it fails this property but 
that's because it's not defined everywhere. 

So, what goes wrong with this argument? Well, if I take the vector field that was in 
the prob lem set, and if I do things, say that I look at the unit circle. That's a closed 
curve. So, I would like to use Green's theorem. Green's theorem would tell me the 
line integra l along this loop is equa l to the double integra l of curl over this reg ion 
here, the unit disk. And, of course the curl is zero, well, except at the orig in. 

At the orig in, the vector field is not defined. You cannot take the derivatives, and the 
curl is not defined. And somehow that messes things up. You cannot app ly Green's 
theorem to the vector field. So, you cannot apply Green's theorem to the vector field 
on prob lem set eight problem two when C encloses the origin. And so, that's why this 
guy, even though it has curl zero, is not conservative. 

There's no contradiction. And somehow, you have to imag ine that, well, the curl here 
is rea lly not defined. But somehow it becomes infinite so that when you do the 
double integra l, you actually get 2 pi  instead of zero. I mean, that doesn't make any 
sense, of course, but that's one way to think about it. OK, any questions? Yes? Well, 
though actually  it's not defined because the curl is zero everywhere else. 

So, if a curl was well defined at the orig in, you would try to, then, take the double 
integral. no matter what va lue you put for a function, if you have a function that's 
zero everywhere except at the orig in, and some other value at the origin, the 
integral is still zero. So, it's worse than that. It's not only that you can't compute it, 
it's that is not defined. OK, anyway, that's like a slightly patholog ical example. 

Yes? Well, we wouldn't be able to because the curl is not defined at the orig in. So, 
you can actua lly integrate it. OK, so that's the problem. I mean, if you try to 
integrate, we've said everywhere where it's defined, the curl  is zero. So, what you 
would be integrating would be zero. But, that doesn't work because at the orig in it's 
not defined. Yes? Ah, so if you take a curve that makes a figure 8, then indeed my 
proof over there is false. 

So, I kind of tricked you. It's not actually correct. So, if the curve does a figure 8, 
then what you do is you would actually cut it into its two halves. And for each of 
them, you will apply Green's theorem. And then, you'd still get, if a curl is zero then 
this line integral  is zero. That one is a lso zero. So this one is zero. OK, small deta ils 
that you don't rea lly need to worry too much about, 

but indeed if you want to be careful with details then my proof is not quite complete. 
But the computation is still true. Let's move on. So, I want to tell you how to prove 
Green's theorem because it's such a strange formula that where can  it come from 
possibly? I mean, so let me remind you first of a ll the statement we want to prove is 
that the  line integral along a closed curve of Mdx p lus Ndy is equal to the double 
integral over the region inside of (Nx minus My)dA. 

And, let's simp lify our lives a bit by proving easier statements. So actua lly, the first 
observation w ill actually prove something easier, namely, that the line integral, let's 
see, of Mdx a long a closed curve is equal to the double integra l over the reg ion 
inside of minus M sub y dA. OK, so that's the special case where N is zero, where 
you have only an x component for your vector field. 

Now, why  is that good enough? Well, the cla im is if I can prove this, I cla im you will 
be ab le to do the same thing to prove the other case where there is only the y 
component. And then, if the other together, you will get the general case. So, let me 
exp lain. OK, so a similar argument which I will not do, to save time, will show, so 
actually it's just the same thing but switching the roles of x and y, 

that if I integrate a long a closed curve N dy, then I'll get the double integral of N sub 
x dA. And so, now if I have proved these two  formulas separately,  then if you sum 
them together w ill get the correct statement. Let me write it. We get Green's 
theorem. OK, so we've simplified our task a little b it. We'll just be trying to prove the 
case where there's only an x component. So, let's do it. 

Well, we have another prob lem which is the region that we are looking at, the curve 
that we're looking at might be very comp licated. If I give you, let's say I give you, I 
don't know, a curve that does something like this. Well, it will be kind of tricky to set 
up a doub le  integral over the region inside. So maybe we first want to look at curves 
that are simpler, that will actually a llow us to set up the double integral easily. 

So, the second observation, so that was the first observation. The second 
observation is that we can decompose R into simpler regions. So what do I mean by 
that? Well, let's say that I have a reg ion and I'm going to cut it into two. So, I'll have 
R1 and R2. And then, of course, I need to have the curves that go around them. So, 
I had my initia l curve, C, was going around everybody. They have curves C1 that 
goes around R1, and C2 goes around R2. 

OK, so, what I would like to say  is if we can prove that the statement is true, so let's 
see,  for C1 and also for C2 -- -- then I cla im we can prove the statement for C. How 
do we do that? Well, we just add these two equalities together. OK, why does that 
work? There's something fishy going on because C1 and C2 have this p iece here in 
the midd le. That's not there in C. So, if you add  the line integral along C1 and C2, 
you get these unwanted pieces. 

But,  the good news  is actua lly you go twice through that edge in the middle. See, it 
appears once in C1 going up, and once in C2 going down. So, in fact, when you w ill 
do the work, when you will sum the work, you w ill add these two guys together. 
They w ill cancel. OK, so  the line integral along C will be, then, it will be the sum of 
the line integrals on C1 and C2. And, that will equal, therefore,  the double integral 
over R1 p lus the doub le  integral over R2, which  is the double integra l over R of 
negative My. 

OK and the reason  for this equa lity here is because we go tw ice through the inner 
part. What do I want to say? Along the boundary between R1 and R2 -- -- w ith 
opposite orientations. So, the extra things cancel out. OK, so that means I just need 
to look at smaller pieces if that makes my life easier. So, now, will make my life 
easy? Well, let's say that I have a curve like that. Well, I guess I should really draw a 
pumpkin or something like that because it would be more seasonal. 

But, well, I don't rea lly know how to draw a pumpkin. OK, so what I will do is I will 
cut this into sma ller regions for which I have a well-defined lower and upper 
boundary so that I will be ab le to set up a doub le integra l, dy dx, easily. So, a region 
like this I will actua lly cut it here and here into  five sma ller p ieces so that each small 
piece w ill let me set up the double integral, dy dx. 

OK, so we'll cut R in to what I will call vertically simple -- -- regions. So, what's a 
vertically simple region? That's a region that's g iven by looking at x between a and b 
for some values of a and b. And, for each va lue of x, y is between some function of x 
and some other function of x. OK, so for example, this guy is vertica lly simp le. See, 
x runs from this va lue of x to that va lue of x. 

And, for each x, y goes between this value to that value. And, same with each of 
these. OK, so now we are down to the main step that we have to do, which is to 
prove this identity if C is, sorry, if -- -- if R is vertica lly simp le -- -- and C is the 
boundary of R going counterclockw ise. OK, so let's look at how we would do it. So, 
we sa id vertica lly simple reg ion  looks  like x goes between a and b, and y goes 
between two values that are g iven by functions of x. 

OK, so  this is y equals f2 of x. This is y equals f1 of x. This is a. This is b. Our region 
is this thing in here. So,  let's compute both sides. And, when I say compute, of 
course we will not get numbers because we don't know what M is. We don't know 
what f1 and f2 are. But, I claim we should be ab le to simplify things a b it. So, let's 
start w ith the line integral. How do I compute the line integral along the curve that 
goes a ll around here? 

Well, it looks like there w ill be four p ieces. OK, so we actually have four things to 
compute, C1, C2, C3, and C4. OK? Well, let's start with C1. So, if we integrate on C1 
Mdx, how do we do that? Well, we know  that on C1, y is given by a  function of x. So, 
we can just get rid of y and express everything in terms of x. OK, so, we know y  is f1 
of x, and x goes from a to b. So, that will be the integra l from a to b of, well, I have 
to take the function, M. 

And so, M depends norma lly on x and y. Maybe I should put x and y here. And then, 
I w ill p lug y equals f1 of x dx. And, then I have a sing le variable integral. And that's 
what I have to compute. Of course, I cannot compute it here because I don't know 
what this  is. So, it has to stay this way. OK, next one. The integral along C2, well, 
let's think for a second. On C2, x equa ls b. It's constant. 

So, dx is zero, and you would integrate, actua lly, above a variable, y. But, well, we 
don't have a y component. See, this is the reason why we made the first 
observation. We got rid of the other term because it's simp lifies our life here. So, we 
just get zero. OK, just looking quickly ahead, there's another one that would be zero 
as well, right? Which one? Yeah, C4. This one gives me zero. 

What about C3? Well, C3 w ill look a lot like C1. So, we're going to use the same kind 
of thing that we d id w ith C. OK, so a long C3, well, let's see, so on C3, y is a  function 
of x, again. And so we are using as our variab le x, but now x goes down from b to a. 
So, it w ill be the integral from b  to a of M of (x and f2 of x) dx. Or, if you prefer, 
that's negative integral from a to b of M of (x and f2 of x) dx. 

OK, so now if I sum all these pieces together, I get that the line integra l along the 
closed curve is the integra l from a to b of M(x1f1 of x) dx minus the integra l from a 
to b of M(x1f2 of x) dx. So, that's the left hand side. Next, I should try to look at my 
double integra l and see if I can make it equa l to that. So, let's look at the other guy, 
double integra l over R of negative MydA. Well, first, I'll take the minus sign out. 

It will make my  life a little b it easier. And second, so I sa id I will try to set this up in 
the way that's the most efficient. And, my choice of this kind of region means that 
it's easier to set up dy dx, right? So, if I set it up dy dx, then I know  for a g iven 
value of x, y goes from f1 of x to f2 of x. And, x goes from a to b, right? Is that OK 
with everyone? OK, so now if I compute the inner integral, well, what do I get if I get 
partial M partia l y with respect to y? 

I'll get M back, OK? So -- So, I will get M at the point x f2 of x minus M at the point x 
f1 of x. And so, this becomes the integra l from a to b. I guess that was a minus sign, 
of M of (x1f2 of x) minus M of (x1f1 of x) dx. And so, that's the same as up there. 
And so, that's the end of the proof because we've checked that for this special case, 
when we have only an x component and a vertically simple reg ion,  things work. 

Then, we can remove the assumption that things are vertica lly simp le using this 
second observation. We can just glue the various p ieces together, and prove it for 
any reg ion. Then, we do same thing with the y component. That's the first 
observation. When we add things together, we get Green's theorem  in its full 
generality. OK, so let me finish with a cool example. So, there's one p lace in real  life 
where Green's theorem used to be extremely useful. 

I say used to because computers have actua lly made that obsolete. But, so  let me 
show you a picture of this device. This is ca lled a planimeter. And what it does is it 
measures areas. So,  it used to be that when you were an experimental scientist, you 
would  run your chemica l or biolog ical experiment or whatever. And, you would have 
all of these record ing devices. And, the data would go, well, not onto a floppy disk or 
hard disk or whatever because you d idn't have those at the time. 

You didn't have a computer in your lab. They would go onto a piece of graph paper. 
So, you would have your graph paper, and you would have some curve on it. And, 
very often, you wanted to know, what's the tota l amount of product that you have 
synthesized, or whatever the question might be. It might relate with the area under 
your curve. So, you'd say, oh,  it's easy. Let's just integrate, except you don't have a 
function. 

You can put that into calculator. The next thing you could do is, well, let's count the 
little squares. But, if you've seen a p iece of graph paper, that's kind of time-
consuming. So, peop le invented these things called planimeters. It's something 
where there is a  rea lly heavy thing based at one corner, and there's a lot of dia ls and 
gauges and everything. And,  there's one arm that you move. And so, what you do is 
you take the moving arm and you just slide it a ll around your curve. 

And, you look at one of the dia ls. And, suddenly what comes, as you go around, it 
gives you complete garbage. But when you come back here, that dia l suddenly g ives 
you the value of the area of this region. So, how does it work? This gadget never 
knows about the reg ion inside because you don't take it a ll over here. You only take 
it along the curve. So, what it does actua lly is it computes a  line integral. 

OK, so  it has this system of wheels and everything that compute for you the  line 
integral along C of, well, it depends on the model. But some of them compute the 
line integra l of x dy. Some of them compute different line integra ls. But, they 
compute some line integra l, OK? And, now, if you apply Green's theorem, you see 
that when you have a counterclockwise curve, this w ill be just the area of the region 
inside. 

And so, that's how it works. I mean, of course, now you use a computer and it does 
the sums. Yes? That costs severa l thousand dollars, possib ly more. So, that's why I 
didn't bring one.
