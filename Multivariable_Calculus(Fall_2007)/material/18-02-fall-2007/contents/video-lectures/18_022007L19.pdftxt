18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 19 

OK. Today we have a new topic, and we are going to start to learn about vector 
fields and line integra ls. Last week we had been doing doub le  integrals. For today we 
just forget all of that, but don't actually forget it. Put it away in a corner of your 
mind. It is going  to come back next week, but what we do today will include line 
integrals. And these are completely different things, so it helps, actually, if you don't 
think of double integrals at all while doing line integrals. 

Anyway, let's start w ith vector fields. What is a vector field? Well, a vector field is 
something that is of a form, while it is a vector, but while M and N, the components, 
actually depend on x and y,on the point where you are. So, they are functions of x 
and y. What that means, concretely, is that every point in the plane you have a 
vector. In a corn field, every where you have corn. In a vector field, everywhere you 
have a vector. That is how it works. A good example of a vector field, I don't know  if 
you have seen these maps that show the wind, but here are some cool images done 
by NASA. 

Actually, that is a picture of w ind patterns off the coast of California with Santa Ana 
winds, in case you are wondering what has been going on recently. You have all of 
these vectors that show you the velocity of the air basically at every point. I mean, 
of course you don't draw it every point, because if you drew a vector at absolutely a ll 
the points of a p lane then you would just fill up everything and you wouldn't see 
anything. 

So, choose points and draw the vectors at those points. Here is another cool image, 
which is upside down. That is a hurricane off the coast of Mexico with the winds 
spiraling around the hurricane. Anyway, it is kind of hard to see. You don't really see 
all the vectors, actua lly, because the autofocus is having trouble with it. It cannot 
really do it, so I guess I will go back to the previous one. Anyway, a vector field is 
something where at each point --

-- in the p lane we have vector F that depends on x and y. This occurs in real life 
when you look at velocity fields in a fluid. For example, the wind. That is what these 
pictures show. At every point you have a velocity of a fluid that is moving. Another 
example is force fields. Now, force fields are not something out of Star Wars. If you 
look at gravitationa l attraction, you know that if you have a mass somewhere, well, 
it will be attracted to fa ll down because of the gravity field of the earth, which means 
that at every point you have a vector that is pointing down. And, the same thing in 
space, you have the gravitationa l field of planets, stars and so on. 

That  is also an example of a vector field because, wherever you go, you would have 
that vector. And what it is depends on where you are. The examples from the rea l 
world are things like velocity in a fluid or force field where you have a force that 
depends on the point where you are. We are going to try to study vector fields 
mathematica lly. We won't really care what they are most of the time, but, as we w ill 
exp lore w ith them defined quantities and so on, we will very often use these 

motivations to justify why we would care about certain quantities. The first thing we 
have to figure out is how do we draw a vector field, you know, how do you generate 
a plot like that? 

Let's practice draw ing a few vector fields. Well, let's say our very first vector field w ill 
be just 2i j. It is kind of a silly vector field because it doesn't actually depend on x 
and y. That means it  is the same vector everywhere. I take a plane and take vector 
<2,1>. I guess it points in that direction. It is two units to the right and one up. And 
I just put that vector everywhere. You just put it at a few points all over the place. 
And when you think you have enough so that you understand what is going on then 
you stop. Here probab ly we don't need that many. I mean here I think we get the 
picture. Everywhere we have a vector <2,1>. 

Now, let's try to look at slightly more interesting examples. Let's say I give you a 
vector field x times  i hat. There is no j component. How would you draw  that? Well, 
first of a ll, we know that this guy is only in the i direction so it is always horizonta l. It 
doesn't have a j component. Everywhere it would be a horizontal vector. Now, the 
question is how long is it? Well, how long it  is depends on x. For example, if x is zero 
then this w ill actually be the zero vector. x is zero here on the y-axis. I w ill take a 
different color. 

If I am on the y-axis, I actually have the zero vector. Now,  if x becomes positive 
sma ll then I will have actually a small positive multiple of  i so I will be going a little 
bit to the right. And then, if I increase x, this guy becomes larger so I get a longer 
vector to the right. If x is negative then my vector field points to the left instead. It 
looks something like that. Any questions about that p icture? No. OK. Usually, we are 
not going to try to have very accurate, you know, we won't actually take time to plot 
a vector field very carefully. I mean, if we need  to, computers can do it for us. It is 
useful to have an idea of what a vector field does roughly. 

Whether it is getting larger and  larger, in what d irection it is pointing, what are the 
general features? Just to do a couple of more, actually, you will see very quickly that 
the examp les I use in lecture are pretty much always the same ones. We will be 
playing a  lot with these particular vector fields just because they are good examp les. 
Let's say I g ive you xi yj. That one has an  interesting geometric significance. If I take 
a point (x, y), there I want to take a vector x, y. How do I do that? Well, it is the 
same as a vector from the origin to this point. I take this vector and I copy it so that 
it starts at one point. It looks like that. And the same thing at every point. 

It is a vector field that  is pointing  radially away from the origin, and its magnitude 
increases w ith distance from the origin. You don't have to draw as many as me, but 
the idea  is this vector field everywhere points away from the origin. And its 
magnitude is equa l to the distance from the orig in. If these were, for example, 
velocity fields, well, you would see visua lly what is happening to your fluid. L ike here 
maybe you have a source at the origin that  is pouring fluid out and it is flow ing all 
the way away from that. 

Let's do just a last one. Let's say I give you minus y, x. What does that look like? 
That  is an interesting one, actually. Let's say that I have a point (x, y) here. This 
vector here is <x, y>. But the vector I want is <- y, x>. What does that look like? It 
is perpend icular to the position to this vector. If I rotate this vector, let me maybe 
draw a p icture on the side, and take vector x, y. 

A vector with components negative y and x is going to be like this. It is the vector 
that I get by rotating by 90 degrees counterclockwise. And, of course, I do not want 
to put that vector at the origin. I want to put it at the point x, y. In  fact, what I w ill 
draw is something like this. And similarly here like that,  like that, etc. And if I am 
closer to the orig in then it looks a bit the same, but it is shorter. And at the origin it 
is zero. And when I am further away it becomes even larger. See, this vector field, if 
it was the motion of a fluid, it would correspond  to a  fluid that is just going around 
the origin  in circles rotating at uniform speed. 

This is actua lly the velocity field for uniform rotation. And, if you figure out how long 
it takes for a particle of fluid to go a ll the way around, that would be actua lly 2(pi) 
because the length of a circle is 2(p i) times the radius. That is actua lly at unit 
angular velocity, one radiant per second or per unit time. That is why this guy comes 
up quite a lot in rea l life. And you can imag ine lots of variations on these. Of course, 
you can also imagine vector fields given by much more complicated  formulas, and 
then you would have a hard time drawing them. Maybe you will use a computer or 
maybe you will just give up and just do whatever ca lculation you have to do without 
trying to visualize the vector field. But if you have a nice simp le one then it is worth 
doing it because sometimes it will give you insight about what you are going to 
compute next. 

Any questions first about these pictures? No. OK. Oh, yes? You are asking if it should 
be y, negative x. I think it would be the other way around. See, for examp le, if I am 
at this point then y is positive and x is zero. If I take y, negative x, I get a positive 
first component and zero for the second one. So, y, negative x would be a rotation at 
unit speed in the opposite d irection. And there are a lot of tweaks you can do to it. If 
you  flip the sides you will get rotation in the other d irection. Yes? 

How do know that  it is at unit angular velocity? Well, that is because if my angular 
velocity is one then that means the actua lly speed is equa l to the distance from the 
orig in. Because the arch length on a circle of a certain rad ius is equa l to the radius 
times the ang le. If the angle varies at rate one then I travel at speed equa l to the 
radius. That is what I do here. The length of this vector is equal to the distance of 
the origin. I mean, it is not obvious on the picture. But, rea lly, the vector that I put 
here is the same as this vector rotated so it has the same length. That is why the 
angular velocity is one. It doesn't rea lly matter much anyway. 

What are we going  to do w ith vector fields? Well, we are going to do a lot of things 
but let's start somewhere. One thing you might want to do with vector fields is I am 
going to think of now the situation where we have a force. If you have a force 
exerted on a particle and that particles moves on some trajectory then probab ly you 
have seen in physics that the work done by the force corresponds to the force dot 
product w ith the d isp lacement vector, how much you have moved your particle. 

And, of course, if you do just a stra ight line trajectory or if the force is constant that 
works well. But if you are moving on a complicated trajectory and the force keeps 
chang ing then, actua lly, you want to integrate that over time. The first thing we will 
do is learn how  to compute the work done by a vector field, and mathematically that 
is called a line integral. Physica lly, remember the work done by a  force is the force 
times the distance. And, more precisely, it is actually the dot product between the 
force as a vector and the d isplacement vector for a sma ll motion. 

Say that your point is moving from here to here, you have the d isplacement delta r. 
It is just the change in the position vector. It is the vector from the old position to 
the new position. And then you have your force that is being exerted. And you do the 
dot product between them. That w ill g ive you the work of a force during this motion. 
And the physical significance of this, well, the work tells you basically how much 
energy you have to provide to actua lly perform this motion. Just in case you haven't 
seen this in 8.01 yet. I am hop ing all of you have heard about work somewhere, but 
in case it is comp letely mysterious that is the amount of energy provided by the 
force. 

If a force goes along the motion, it actually pushes the particle. It provides an 
energy to do it to do that motion. And, conversely, if you are trying to go aga inst the 
force then you have to provide energy to the particle to be able to do  that. In 
particular, if this is the only force that  is taking place then the work would be the 
variation in kinetic energy of a particle a long the motion. That is a good description 
for a sma ll motion. 

But let's say that my particle  is not just doing that but it's doing something 
complicated and my force keeps changing. Somehow maybe I have a d ifferent force 
at every point. Then I want to find the total work done a long the motion. Well, what 
I have to do is cut my trajectory into these little pieces. And, for each of them, I 
have a vector a long the trajectory. I have a force, I do the dot product and I sum 
them together. And, of course, to get the actual answer, I should actually cut into 
sma ller and smaller pieces and sum all of the small contributions to work. So, in fact, 
it is going to be an integra l. Along some trajectory, let's ca ll C the trajectory for 
curve. 

It is some curve. The work adds up to an integral. We write this using the notation 
integral along C of F dot dr. We have to decode this notation. One way to decode this 
is to say it is a  limit as we cut into sma ller and smaller pieces of the sum over each 
piece of a trajectory of the force of a g iven point dot product w ith that sma ll vector 
along the trajectory. Well, that is not how we will compute it. To compute it, we do 
things differently. How can we actually compute it? Well, what we can do is say that 
actually we are cutting things into sma ll time interva ls. 

The way that we split the trajectory is we just take a picture every, say, millisecond. 
Every millisecond we have a new position. And the motion, the amount by which you 
have moved during each small time interva l is basically the velocity vector times the 
amount of time. In fact, let me just rewrite this. You do the dot product between the 
force and how much you have moved, well, if I just rewrite it this way, nothing has 
happened, but what this thing is, actua lly, is the velocity vector dr over dt. What I 
am trying to say is that I can actually compute by integral by integrating F dot 
product w ith dr / dt over time. 

Whatever the initial time to whatever the final time is, I  integrate F dot product 
velocity dt. And, of course, here this F, I mean F at the point on the trajectory at 
time t. This guy depends on x and y before it depends on t. I see a lot of confused 
faces, so let's do an examp le. Yes? Yes. Here I need to put a limit as delta t to zero. 
I cut my trajectory into sma ller and smaller time intervals. For each time interva l, I 
have a sma ll motion which is, essentially, velocity times delta  t, and then I dot that 
with a force and I sum them. Let's do an example. Let's say that we want to  find the 
work of this force. I guess that was the first example we had. 

It is a  force field that tries to make everything rotate somehow. Your first points 
along these circles. And let's say that our trajectory, our particle is moving a long the 
parametric curve. x = t, y = t^2 for t going from zero to one. What that looks like --
Well, maybe I should draw you a p icture. Our vector field. Our trajectory. If you try 
to p lot this, when you see y is actually x squared, so it a piece of parabola that goes 
from the origin to (1, 1). That is what our curve looks like. 

We are trying to get the work done by our force along this trajectory. I should point 
out; I mean if you are asking me how d id I get this? That is actua lly the wrong 
question. This is all part of the data. I have a force and I have a trajectory, and I 
want to  find what the work done is along that trajectory. These two guys I can 
choose comp letely independently of each other. The integra l a long C of F dot dr will 
be --

Well, it is the integral from time zero to time one of F dot the velocity vector dr over 
dt times dt. That would be the integral from zero to one. Let's try to figure it out. 
What is F? F, at a point (x, y),  is <- y, x>. But if I take the point where I am at time 
t then x is t and y  is t squared. Here I plug x equals t, y equals t squared, and that 
will give me negative t squared,  t. Here I will put negative t squared, t dot product. 
What is the velocity vector? Well, dx over dt is just one, dy over dt is 2t. 

So, the velocity vector is 1, 2t dt. Now we have to continue the calculation. We get 
integral from zero to one of, what is this dot product? Well, it is negative t squared 
plus 2t squared. I get t squared. Well, maybe I will write it. Negative t squared plus 
2t squared dt. That ends up being integra l from zero to one of t squared dt, which 
you all know how to integrate and get one-third. That is the work done by the force 
along this curve. Yes? 

Well, I got it by just taking the dot product between the force and the velocity. That 
is in case you are wondering, things go like this. Any questions on how we did this 
calculation? No. Yes? Why can't you just do F dot dr? Well, soon we will be ab le to. 
We don't know yet what dr means or how to use it as a symbol because we haven't 
said yet, I mean, see, this is a d vector r. That is kind of strange thing to have. And 
certainly r is not a usua l variab le. We have to be careful about what are the rules, 
what does this symbol mean? We are going to see that right now. 

And then we can do it, actua lly, in a slightly more efficient way. I mean r is not a 
sca lar quantity. R is a position vector. You cannot integrate F with respect to r. We 
don't know how to do that. OK. Yes? The question is  if I took a different trajectory 
from the origin to that point (1, 1), what w ill happen? Well,  the answer is I would get 
something different. For example, let me try to convince you of that. For examp le, 
say I chose to  instead go like this and then around like that,  first I wouldn't do any 
work because here the force is perpendicular to my motion. 

And then I would be going against the force all the way around. I should get 
something that is negative. Even if you don't see that, just accept it at face va lue 
that I say now. The value of a line integral, in general, depends on how we got from 
point a to point b. That  is why we have to compute it by using the parametric 
equation for the curve. It rea lly depends on what curve you choose. Any other 
questions. Yes? 

What happens when the force inflects the trajectory? Well, then, actua lly, you would 
have to solve a differentia l equation telling you how a particle moves to find what the 

trajectory is. That is something that would be a very useful top ic. And that is 
probably more like what you w ill do  in 18.03, or maybe you actually know how to do 
it in this case. What we are trying to develop here is a method to  figure out if we 
know what the trajectory is what the work will be. It doesn't tell us what the 
trajectory will be. But, of course, we could also find that. But here, see, I am not 
assuming,  for examp le, that the particle is moving just based on that force. 

Maybe, actually, I am here to hold it in my hand and force it to go where it is going, 
or maybe there is some rail that  is taking it in that trajectory or whatever. I can 
really do it a long any trajectory. And, if I wanted to,  if I knew that was the case, I 
could try to find the trajectory based on what the force is. But that  is not what we 
are doing here. Let's try to make sense of what you asked just a  few minutes ago, 
what can we do directly with dr? dr becomes somehow a vector. I mean, when I 
replace it by dr over dt times dt, it becomes something that is a vector w ith a dt next 
to it. In fact --

Well, it is not rea lly new. Let's see. Another way to do it, let's say that our force has 
components M and N. I cla im that we can write symbolically vector dr stands for its 
vector whose components are dx, dy. It is a strange kind of vector. I mean it is not a 
real vector, of course, but as a notion, it is a pretty good notation because it tells us 
that F of dr is M dx p lus N dy. In  fact, we w ill very often write, instead of F dot dr line 
integral along c will be line integral along c of M dx p lus N dy. 

And so, in this language, of course, what we are integrating now, rather than a 
vector field, becomes a differential. But you should think of it, too, as being pretty 
much the same thing. It is like when you compare the grad ient of a  function and its 
differentia l, they are different notations but have the same content. Now, there still 
rema ins the question of how do we compute this kind of integral? Because it is more 
subtle than the notation suggests. 

Because M and N both depend on x and y. And,  if you just  integrate it w ith respect to 
x, you would be left with y's in there. And you don't want to be left w ith y's. You 
want a number at the end. See, the catch is along the curve x and y are actually 
related to each other. Whenever we write this, we have two variab les x and y, but, in 
fact, along the curve C we have only one parameter. It could be x. It could be y. 

It could be time. Whatever you want. But we have to express everything in terms of 
that one parameter. And then we get a usua l single variable integra l. How do we 
eva luate things  in this  language? Well, we do it by substituting the parameter into 
everything. The method to eva luate  is to express x and y in terms of a single 
variable. And then substitute that variable. Let's, for examp le, redo the one we had 
up there just using these new notations. You will see that it is the same calculation 
but w ith d ifferent notations. 

In that examp le that we had, our vector field F was negative <-y, x>. What we are 
integrating is negative y dx plus x dy. And, see,  if we have just this, we don't know 
how to integrate that. I mean, well, you could try to come up with negative x, y or 
something like that. But that actually doesn't make sense. It doesn't work. What we 
will do is we w ill actually have to express everything in terms of a same variable, 
because it is a sing le integra l and we should only have on variable. And what that 
variable will be, well, if we just do it the same way that would just be t. 

How do we express everything in terms of t? Well, we use the parametric equation. 
We know that x is t and y is t squared. We know what to do with these two guys. 
What about dx and dy? Well, it is easy. We just differentiate. dx becomes dt, dy 
becomes 2t dt. I am just saying, in a different language, what I said over here w ith 
dx over dt equals one, dy over dt equa ls 2t. It is the same thing but written slightly 
differently. Now, I am going to do it again. I am going to sw itch  from one board to 
the next one. My integral becomes the integra l over C of negative y is minus t 
squared dt p lus x is t times dy is 2t dt. 

And now that I have only t left, it is fine to say I have a usua l single variable integra l 
over a variable t that goes from zero to one. Now I can say, yes, this is the integra l 
from zero to one of that stuff. I can simp ly it a b it and it becomes t squared dt, and I 
can compute it, equa ls one-third. I have negative t squared and then I have plus 2t 
squared, so end up with positive t squared. It  is the same as up there. Any 
questions? Yes? 

dy is the d ifferential of y, y is t squared, so I get 2t dt. I plug dt for dx, I plug 2t dt 
for dy and so on. And that is the general method. If you are given a curve then you 
first have to figure out how do you express x and y in terms of the same thing? And 
you get to choose,  in genera l, what parameter we use. You choose to parameterize 
your curve in whatever way you want. The note that I want to make is that this line 
integral depends on the trajectory C but not on the parameterization. 

You can choose whichever variable you want. For examp le, what you could do is 
when you know that you have that trajectory, you could also choose to parameterize 
it as x equa ls, I don't know, sine theta, y equals sine square theta, because y is x 
squared where theta goes from zero  to p i over two. And then you could get dx and 
dy in terms of d theta. And you would be ab le to do it w ith a lot of trig and you 
would get the same answer. That would be a harder way to get the same thing. 
What you should do in practice  is use the most reasonab le way to parameterize your 
curve. 

If you know that you have a piece of parabola y equa ls x squared, there is no way 
you would put sine and sine squared. You could set x equals, y equa ls t squared, 
which is very reasonable. You could even take a small shortcut and say that your 
variable will be just x. That means x you just keep as it is. And then, when you have 
y, you set y equa ls x squared, dy equa ls 2x dx, and then you will have an  integral 
over x. That works. 

So, this one is not practical. But you get to choose. Now let me tell you a b it more 
about the geometry. We have said here is how we compute it in general, and that is 
the general method  for computing a line integra l for work. You can a lways do this, 
try to find a parameter, the simp lest one, express everything in terms of its variable 
and then you have an  integral to compute. But sometimes you can actua lly save a 
lot of work by just thinking geometrically about what this a ll does. Let me tell you 
about the geometric approach. One thing  I want to remind you of first is what is this 
vector dr? 

Well, what is vector delta r? If I take a very sma ll piece of the trajectory then my 
vector delta r w ill be tangent to the trajectory. It w ill be going in the same direction 
as the unit tangent vector t. And what is  its length? Well, its length is the arc length 
along the trajectory, which we called delta s. Remember, s was the d istance a long 
the trajectory. We can write vector dr equals dx, dy, but that is a lso T times ds. It  is 

a vector whose direction is tangent to the curve and whose length element is actually 
the arc length element. 

I mean, if you don't like this notation, think about d ividing everything by dt. Then 
what we are saying is dr over dt, which is the velocity vector. Well, in coord inates, 
the velocity vector is dx over dt, dy over dt. But, more geometrically, the d irection of 
a velocity vector is tangent to  the trajectory and its magnitude is speed ds over dt. 
So, that is really the same thing. If I say this, that means that my line integra l F to 
dr, well, I say I can write it as integral of M dx p lus N dy. That is what I w ill do if I 
want to compute it by computing the integral. 

But,  if instead I want to think about it geometrically, I could  rewrite it as F dot T ds. 
Now you can think of this, F dot T is a sca lar quantity. It is the tangent component of 
my force. I take my force and project it to the tangent direction to a trajectory and 
the I integrate that along the curve. They are the same thing. And sometimes it is 
easier to do it this way. Here is an examp le. This is bound to be easier only when the 
field and the curve are relatively simp le and have a geometric relation to each other. 
If I give you an evil formula w ith x cubed plus y to the fifth or whatever there is very 
little chance that you w ill be ab le to simp lify  it that way. 

But let's say that my trajectory is just a circle of rad ius a centered at the orig in. Let's 
say I am doing that counterclockw ise and  let's say that my vector field is xi yj. What 
does that look like? Well, my trajectory is just this circle. My vector field, remember, 
xi plus yj, that is the one that is pointing radia lly from the orig in. Hopefully, if you 
have good physics intuition here, you will already know what the work is going to be. 
It is going to be zero because the force is perpendicular to the motion. 

Now we can say it directly by saying if you have any point of a circle then the 
tangent vector to the circle w ill be, well, it's tangent to the circle, so  that means it is 
perpendicular to the rad ial direction, while the force is pointing in the rad ial direction 
so you have a  right angle between them. F is perpendicular to T. F dot T is zero. The 
line integra l of F dot T ds is just zero. That is much easier than writing this is integra l 
of x over dx p lus y over dy. What do we do? Well, we set x equals a cosine theta, y 
equa ls a sine theta. 

We get a bunch of trig things. It cancels out to zero. It is not much harder but we 
saved time by not even thinking about how to parameterize things. Let's just do a 
last one. That was the first one. Let's say now that I take the same curve C, but now 
my vector field is the one that rotates negative yi plus xj. That means along my 
circle the tangent vector goes like this and my vector field is a lso going around. So, 
in fact, at this point the vector field w ill a lways be going  in the same d irection. 

Now F is actua lly parallel to  the tangent d irection. That means that the dot product 
of F dot T, remember, if it is the component of F in this direction that w ill be the 
same of the length of F. But what is the length of F on this circle if this length is a? It 
is just going to be a. That is what we sa id earlier about this vector field. At every 
point, this dot product is a. Now we know how to integrate that quite quickly. 

Because it becomes the integral of a ds, but a is a constant so we can take it out. 
And now what do we get when we integrate ds along C? Well, we should get the tota l 
length of the curve if we sum a ll the little pieces of arc length. But we know  that the 
length of a circle of rad ius a is 2p i a, so we get 2(pi)a squared. If we were to 
compute that by hand, well, what would we do? We would be computing integra l of 

minus y dx plus x dy. Since we are on a circle, we will probably set x equa ls a times 
cosine theta, y equa ls a times sine theta  for theta between zero and 2p i. Then we 
would get dx and dy out of these. So, y is a sine theta, dx is negative a sine theta d 
theta, if you differentiate a cosine, p lus a cosine theta times a cosine theta d theta. 

Well, you will just end up with integral from zero to 2pi of a squared time sine 
squared theta plus cosine square theta times d theta. That becomes just one. And 
you get the same answer. It took about the same amount of time because I did this 
one rushing very quickly, but normally it takes about at least tw ice the amount of 
time to do it with a calculation. That tells you sometimes it is worth thinking 
geometrically.
