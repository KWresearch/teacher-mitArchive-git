18.02 Multivariab le Ca lculus, Fa ll 2007 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 24 

So, there's the third exam in this class w ill be on Thursday. I'm sure you a lready 
know. Just remind you, you will go to  the usual place when there's an exam. 
Namely, if your last name starts w ith  letter a to r, or if you're left handed, then you 
should go to Wa lker. And if you start with s to z, then you should come here. As 
usua l, there's no documents, no calculators a llowed. And, for those of you who can't 
make it, then you have to ta lk to us in advance. That there will be make-ups next 
week as usual, not on Monday because Monday is a holiday. Yea! [LAUGHTER] OK, 
the other piece of information is that I will have slightly extended office hours 
because I know a lot of you are anxious about the test. 

So, today I will be in my office after class until 3:30, and tomorrow from 3:30-6:00. 
And, well let's see. So, before we actually start reviewing for the test, I still have to 
tell you a few small things because I promised to say a few words about what's the 
difference, or precisely, what's the d ifference between curl being zero and a field 
being a gradient field, and why we have this assumption that our vector field had to 
be defined everywhere for a field w ith curl zero  to actually be conservative for our 
test for gradient fields to be valid? So --

More about validity of Green's theorem and things like that. So, we've seen the 
statement of Green's theorem in two  forms. Both of them have to do w ith comparing 
a line integra l a long a closed curve to a double integra l over the reg ion  inside 
enclosed by the curve. So, one of them says the line integra l for the work done by a 
vector field a long a closed curve counterclockwise is equa l to the double integra l of a 
curl of a field over the enclosed region. And, the other one says the tota l flux out of 
the region, so, the flux through the curve is equal to the doub le  integral of 
divergence of a field in the reg ion. 

So, in both cases, we need the vector field to be defined not only, I mean, the left 
hand side makes sense if a vector field is just defined on the curve because it's just a 
line integra l on C. We don't care what happens inside. But, for the right-hand side to 
make sense, and therefore for the equality to make sense, we need the vector field 
to be defined everywhere inside the region. So, I said,  if there is a point somewhere 
in here where my vector field is not defined, then it doesn't work. And actua lly, 
we've seen that examp le. Oops. 

So, this only works if F and its derivatives are defined everywhere in the reg ion, R. 
Otherw ise, we are in troub le. OK, so we've seen for example that if I gave you the 
vector field minus yi xj over x squared p lus y squared, so that's the same vector field 
that was on that problem set a coup le of weeks ago. Then, well, f is not defined at 
the origin, but it's defined everywhere else. And, wherever it's defined, it's curl is 
zero. 

I should say everywhere it's -- And so, if we have a closed curve in the p lane, well, 
there's two situations. One is if it does not enclose the origin. Then, yes, we can 
apply Green's theorem and it will tell us that it's equal to the double integral in here 

of curl F dA, which will be zero because this is zero. However, if I have a curve that 
encloses the orig in, let's say like this, for examp le, then, well, I cannot use the same 
method because the vector field and its curl are not defined at the orig in. 

And, in  fact, you know that ignoring the problem and saying, well, the curl is still 
zero everywhere, will give you the wrong answer because we've seen an example. 
We've seen that along the unit circle the total work is 2 p i not zero. So, we can't use 
Green. However, we can't use it d irectly. So, there is an extended version of Green's 
theorem that tells you the follow ing thing. Well,  it tells me that even though I can't 
do things for just this region enclosed by C prime, I can still do things for the region 
in between two different curves. 

OK, so  let me show you what I have in mind. So, let's say that I have my curve C '. 
Where's my yellow chalk? Oh, here. So, I have this curve C'. I can't apply Green's 
theorem inside it, but let's get out the sma ller thing. So, that one I'm going to make 
going clockwise. You w ill see why. Then, I could say, well, let me change my mind. 
This picture is not very well prepared. That's because my writer is on strike. OK, so 
let's say we have C ' and C'' both going counterclockwise. 

Then, I cla im that Green's theorem still app lies, and tells me that the line integral 
along C prime minus the line integra l a long C double prime is equa l to the double 
integral over the region in between. So here, now, it's this reg ion w ith the hole of the 
curve. And, well, in our case, that will turn out to be zero because curl is zero. OK, 
so this doesn't tell us what each of these two line integra ls is. But actua lly, it tells us 
that they are equa l to each other. And so, by computing one, you can see actua lly 
that for this vector field, if you take any curve that goes counterclockw ise around the 
orig in, you would get two pi no matter what the curve is. 

So how do you get to this? Why is this not like conceptually a new theorem? Well, 
just think of the follow ing thing. I'm not going to do it on top of that because it's 
going to be messy if I draw too many things. But, so here I have my C''. Here, I 
have C'. Let me actua lly make a slit that w ill connect them to each other like this. So 
now if I take, see, I can  form a single closed curve that w ill enclose all of this region 
with kind of an infinitely thin slit here counterclockw ise. And so, if I go 
counterclockwise around this region, basica lly I go counterclockw ise a long the outer 
curve. Then I go a long the slit. 

Then I go clockwise a long the inside curve, then back along the slit. And then I'm 
done. So, if I take the line integral along this b ig curve consisting of a ll these p ieces, 
now I can app ly Green's theorem to that because it is the usua l counterclockw ise 
curve that goes around a region where my field  is well-defined. See, I've eliminated 
the origin  from the p icture. And, so the tota l line integra l for this thing is equal to the 
integral along C prime, I guess the outer one. Then, I also need to have what I do 
along the inner side. And, the inner side is going to be C double prime, but going 
backwards because now I'm going clockw ise on C prime so that I'm going 
counterclockwise around the shaded region. 

Well, of course there w ill be contributions from the line integra l a long this wide 
segment. But, I do it twice, once each way. So,  they cancel out. So, the white 
segments cancel out. You probab ly shouldn't, in your notes, write down white 
segments because probably they are not white on your paper. But, hopefully you get 
the meaning of what I'm trying to say. OK, so basically that tells you, you can still 
play tricks w ith Green's theorem when the reg ion has holes in it. You just had to be 

careful and somehow subtract some other curve so that together things will work 
out. There is a similar thing with the divergence theorem, of course, with flux and 
double integra l of div f, you can apply exactly the same argument. 

OK, so basically you can apply Green's theorem  for a  region that has several 
boundary curves. You just have to be careful that the outer boundary must go 
counterclockwise. The inner boundary either goes clockw ise, or you put a minus sign. 
OK, and the last cultural note, so, the definition, we say that a  reg ion in the plane, 
sorry, I should say a connected reg ion in the plane, so that means -- So, connected 
means  it consists of a sing le p iece. OK, so, connected, there is a sing le p iece. These 
two guys together are not connected. But, if I join them, then this is a connected 
region. We say  it's simp ly connected --

-- if any closed curve in it, OK, so I need to gave a name to my reg ion,  let's say R, 
any closed curve in R, bounds, no, sorry. If the interior of any closed curve in R -- --
is also contained in R. So, concretely, what does that mean? That means the region, 
R, does not have any holes inside it. Maybe I should draw two pictures to exp lain 
what I mean. So, this guy here is simply connected while --

-- this guy here  is not simp ly connected because if I take this curve, that's a curve 
inside my region. But, the piece that it bounds is not actually entirely contained in 
my orig in. And, so why is that relevant? Well, if you know that your vector field is 
defined everywhere in a simply connected region, then you don't have to worry 
about this question of, can I apply Green's theorem to the inside? You know it's 
automatica lly OK because if you have a closed curve, then the vector field is, I 
mean, if a vector field is defined on the curve it will also be defined inside. 

OK, so  if the domain of definition -- -- of a vector field is defined and differentiable --
-- is simply connected -- -- then we can always apply -- -- Green's theorem -- --
and, of course, provided that we do it on a curve where the vector field is defined. I 
mean, your line integral doesn't make sense so  there's nothing to compute. But, if 
you have, so, aga in, the argument would be, well, if a vector field is defined on the 
curve,  it's also defined inside. 

So, see, the problem w ith that vector field here is precisely that its doma in of 
definition is not simply connected because there is a hole, namely the origin. OK, so 
for this guy, doma in of definition, which is plane minus the orig in with the origin 
removed is not simply connected. And so that's why you have this line integra l that 
makes perfect sense, but you can't apply Green's theorem to it. So now, what does 
that mean a particular? Well, we've seen this criterion that if a curl of the vector field 
is zero and it's defined in the entire p lane, then the vector field is conservative, and 
it's a gradient field. 

And, the argument to prove that  is basically to use Green's theorem. So, in fact, the 
actual optima l statement you can make is if a vector field is defined in a simply 
connected  region, and its curl is zero, then it's a grad ient field. So, let me just write 
that down. So, the correct statement, I mean, the previous one we've seen  is also 
correct. But this one is somehow better and closer to what exactly is needed if curl F 
is zero and the doma in of definition where F is defined is simp ly connected --

-- then F is conservative. And that means a lso it's a gradient field. It's the same 
thing. OK, any questions on this? No? OK, some good news. What I've just sa id here 
won't come up on the test on Thursday. OK. (APPLAUSE) Still, it's stuff that you 

should be aware of generally speaking because it w ill be useful, say, on the next 
week's problem set. And, maybe on the fina l it would be, there won't be any really, 
really comp licated things probably, but you might need to be at least vaguely aware 
of this  issue of things being simply connected. 

And by the way, I mean, this is also somehow the starting point of topology, which is 
the branch of math that studies the shapes of regions. So,  in particular, you can try 
to d istinguish domains in the pla ins by looking at whether they're simply connected 
or not, and what kinds of features they have in terms of how you can joint point 
what kinds of curves exist in them. And, since that's the branch of math in which I 
work, I thought I should tell you a bit about it. 

OK, so now back to review ing for the exam. So, I'm going to basically list top ics. 
And, if time permits, I will say a few things about problems from practice exam 3B. 
I'm hoping that you have it or your neighbor has it, or you can somehow get it. 
Anyway, given time, I'm not sure how much I w ill say about the problems in and of 
themselves. OK, so  the main thing to know about this exam is how to set up and 
eva luate double integra ls and line integrals. OK, if you know how to do these two 
things, then you are in much better shape than if you don't. 

And -- So, the first thing we've seen, just to write it down, there's two ma in objects. 
And, it's kind of important to not confuse them with each other. OK, there's double 
integrals of our regions of some quantity, dA, and the other one is the line integral 
along a curve of a vector field, F.dr or F.Mds depend ing on whether it's work or flux 
that we are trying to do. And, so we should know how  to set up these things and 
how to eva luate them. And, roughly speaking, in this one you start by drawing a 
picture of the region, then deciding which way you w ill integrate it. 

It could be dx dy, dy dx, r dr d theta, and then you will set up the bound carefully by 
slicing it and studying how the bounds for the  inner variable depend on the outer 
variable. So, the first topic will be setting up double integrals. And so, remember, 
OK, so maybe I should make this more exp licit. We want to draw a picture of R and 
take slices in the chosen way so that we get an iterated integral. OK, so let's do just 
a quick examp le. So, if I look at prob lem one on the exam 3B, it says to look at the 
line integra l from zero to one, 

line integra l from x to 2x of possibly something, but dy dx. And it says, let's  look at 
how we would set this up the other way around by exchang ing x and y. So, we 
should get to something that w ill be the same integral dx dy. I mean, if you have a 
function of x and y, then  it will be the same function. But, of course, the bounds 
change. So, how do we exchange the order of integration? Well, the only way to do it 
consistently is to draw a p icture. So, let's see, what does this mean? Here, it means 
we integrate from y equals x to y equa ls 2x, x between zero and one. So, we should 
draw a p icture. 

The lower bound for y is y equals x. So, let's draw y equa ls x. That seems to be here. 
And, we'll go up to y equals 2x, which is a line a lso but with b igger slope. And then, 
all right, so  for each va lue of x, my origin will go from x to 2x. Well, and I do this for 
all va lues of x that go to x equals one. So, I stop at x equa ls one, which is here. And 
then, my reg ion is something like this. OK, so this point here, in case you are 
wondering, well, when x equa ls one, y is one. And that point here is one, two. OK, 
any questions about that so far? 

OK, so somehow that's the first kill, when you see an integra l, how to  figure out 
what it means, how to draw the reg ion. And then there's a converse scale which  is 
given the region, how to set up the  integral for it. So, if we want to set up instead dx 
dy, then it means we are going to actually  look at the converse question which is, for 
a given va lue of y, what is the range of values of x? OK, so if we fix y, well, where do 
we enter the reg ion, and where do we leave it? So, we seem to enter on this side, 
and we seem to leave on that side. At least that seems to be true for the first few 
values of y that I choose. But, hey, if I take a larger value of y, then I will enter on 
the side, and I w ill leave on this vertica l side, not on that one. So, I seem to have 
two d ifferent things going on. OK, the place where enter my reg ion is always y 
equa ls 2x, which is the same as x equals y over two. 

So, x seems to a lways start at y over two. But, where I leave to be either x equals y, 
or here, x equals y. And, that depends on the va lue of y. So, in fact, I have to break 
this into two d ifferent integra ls. I have to treat separately the case where y is 
between zero and one, and between one and two. So, what I do in that case is I just 
make two  integrals. So, I say, both of them start at y over two. But, in the first case, 
we'll stop at x equa ls y. In the second case, we'll stop at x equals one. OK, and now, 
what are the values of y for each case? Well, the first case is when y is between zero 
and one. 

The second case is when y is between one and two, which I guess this picture now is 
completely unreadable, but hopefully you've been follow ing what's going on, or else 
you can see it in the solutions to the problem. And, so that's our final answer. OK, 
any questions about how to set up double integrals in xy coord inates? No? OK, who 
feels comfortable with this kind of problem? OK, good. I'm happy to see the vast 
majority. So, the bad news is we have to be able to do it not only in xy coordinates, 
but a lso in polar coordinates. 

So, when you go to polar coord inates, basically all you have to remember on the side 
of integrand is that x becomes r cosine theta. Y becomes r sine theta. And, dx dy 
becomes r dr d theta. In terms of how you slice for your region, well, you w ill be 
integrating first over r. So, that means what you're doing  is you're fixing the value of 
theta. And, for that va lue of theta, you ask yourself, for what range of va lues of r am 
I going to be inside my orig in? 

So, if my origin looks like this, then for this value of theta, r would go  from zero to 
whatever this d istance is. And of course I have to find how this distance depends on 
theta. And then, I w ill find the extreme values of theta. Now, of course, is the origin 
is rea lly looking like this, then you're not going to do it in polar coordinates. But, if 
it's like a circle or a ha lf circle, or things like that, then even  if a problem doesn't tell 
you to do it in polar coord inates you might want to seriously consider it. 

OK, so I'm not going to do it but prob lem two in the practice exam is a good 
example of doing something in polar coord inates. OK, so in terms of things that we 
do with doub le integra ls, there's a few formulas that I'd like you to remember about 
applications that we've seen of double integrals. So, quantities that we can compute 
with double integra ls include things like the area of region, its mass if it has a 
density,  the average value of some function,  for example, the average va lue of the x 
and y coord inates, which we called the center of mass or moments of inertia. So, 
these are just formulas to remember. 

So, for example, the area of region is the double integra l of just dA, or if it helps 
you, one dA if you want. You are integrating the function 1. You have to remember 
formulas for mass, for the average va lue of a  function is the F bar, in particular x bar 
y bar, which is the center of mass, and the moment of inertia. OK, so the polar 
moment of inertia, which is moment of inertia about the orig in. OK, so that's doub le 
integral of x squared plus y squared, density dA, but also moments of inertia about 
the x and y axis, which are g iven by just taking one of these guys. 

Don't worry about moments of inertia about an arbitrary line. I will ask you for a 
moment of inertia  for some weird line or something like that. OK, but these you 
should know. Now, what if you somehow, on the spur of the moment, you forget, 
what's the formula for moment of inertia? Well, I mean, I prefer if you know, but if 
you have a complete blank in your memory, there w ill still be partia l credit were 
setting up the bounds and everything else. 

So, the general rule for the exam will be if you're stuck in a calculation or you're 
missing a little piece of the puzzle, try to do as much as you can. In particular, try to 
at least set up the bounds of the integral. There will be partia l cred it for that a lways. 
So, while we're at it about grand rules, how about evaluation? How about eva luating 
integrals? So, once you've set it up, you have to sometimes compute it. 

First of all, check just in case the prob lem says set up but do not evaluate. Then, 
don't waste your time evaluating it. If a prob lem says to compute it, then you have 
to compute it. So, what kinds of  integration techniques do you need to know? So, 
you need to know, you must know, well, how to integrate the usua l functions like 
one over x or x to the n, or exponentia l, sine, cosine,  things like that, OK, so  the 
usua l integra ls. 

You must know what I w ill ca ll easy trigonometry. OK, I don't want to give you a 
complete list. And the more you ask me about which ones are on the  list, the more I 
will add to the list. But,  those that you know that you should know, you should know. 
Those that you think you shouldn't know, you don't have to know because I w ill say 
what I will say soon. You should know also substitution, how to set U equals 
something, and then see, oh, this becomes u times du, and so substitution method. 
What do I mean by easy trigonometrics? Well, certainly you should know how to 
ingrate sine. You should know how to integrate cosine. You should be aware that 
sine squared p lus cosine squared simp lifies to one. 

And, you should be aware of genera l things like that. I would like you to know, 
maybe, the double angles, sine 2x and cosine 2x. Know what these are, and the 
kinds of the easy things you can do with that, also things that involve substitution 
setting like U equals sine T or U equa ls cosine T. I mean, let me, instead, g ive an 
example of hard trig that you don't need to know, and then I will answer. 

OK, so, not needed on Thursday; it doesn't mean that I don't want you to know 
them. I would love you to know every single integral formula. But, that shouldn't be 
your top priority. So, you don't need to know things like hard trigonometric ones. So, 
let me g ive you an example. OK, so if I ask you to do this one, then actua lly I will 
give you maybe, you know, I will reprint the formula  from the notes or something 
like that. OK, so  that one you don't need to know. I would love if you happen to 
know it, but  if you need it, it will be given to you. 

So, these kinds of things that you cannot compute by any easy method. And, 
integration by parts, I believe that I successfully test-solved a ll the prob lems w ithout 
doing any single integration by parts. Again, in general, it's something that I would 
like you to know, but it shouldn't be a top priority for this week. OK, sorry, you had a 
question, or? Inverse trigonometric functions: let's say the most easy ones. I would 
like you to know the easiest  inverse trig functions, but not much. OK, OK, so be 
aware that these functions exist, but  it's not a top priority. 

I should say,  the more I tell you I don't need you to know, the more your physics 
and other teachers might comp lain that, oh, these guys don't know how to  integrate. 
So, try not to  forget everything. But, yes? No, no, here I just mean for eva luating 
just a single variab le integral. I will get to change variab les and Jacobian soon, but 
I'm thinking of this as a different topic. What I mean by this one is  if I'm asking you 
to integrate, I don't know, what's a good examp le? 

Zero to one t dt over square root of one p lus t squared, then you should think of 
maybe substituting u equals one plus t squared, and then it becomes easier. OK, so 
this kind of trig, that's what I have in mind here specifically. And again, if you're 
stuck, in particular, if you hit this dreaded guy, and you don't actua lly have a 
formula giving you what it  is, it means one of two things. One is something's wrong 
with your solution. The other option is something is wrong with my prob lem. So, 
either way, check quickly what you've done it if you can't find a mistake, then just 
move ahead to  the next prob lem. 

Which one, this one? Yeah, I mean if you can do it, if you know how to do it, which 
everything is fa ir: I mean, generally speaking, g ive enough of it so that you  found 
the solution by yourself, not like, you know, it d idn't somehow come to you by 
magic. But, yeah, if you know how to integrate this w ithout doing the substitution, 
that's absolutely fine by me. Just show enough work. The general rule is show 
enough work that we see that you knew what you are doing. 

OK, now another thing we've seen w ith double integra ls  is how to do more 
complicated changes of variables. So, when you want to rep lace x and y by some 
variables, u and v, given by some formulas in terms of x and y. So, you need to 
remember basica lly how to do them. So, you need to remember that the method 
consists of three steps. So, one is you have to  find the Jacob ian. And, you can 
choose to do either this Jacobian or the inverse one depending on what's easiest 
given what you're g iven. You don't have to worry about solving for things the other 
way around. Just compute one of these Jacob ians. 

And then, the rule is that du dv is absolute va lue of the Jacob ian dx dy. So, that 
takes care of dx dy, how to convert that into du dv. The second thing to know is 
that, well, you need to of course substitute any x and y's in the integrand to convert 
them to u's and v's so that you have a va lid integrand involving only u and v. And 
then, the last part is setting up the bounds. And you see that, probably you seen on 
P-sets and an examp le we did in the lecture that this can be complicated. But now, in 
real life, you do this actually to simplify the integrals. So, probab ly the one that w ill 
be there on Thursday, if there's a problem about that on Thursday,  it will be a 
situation where the bounds that you get after changing variables are reasonab ly 
easy. OK, I'm not saying that it w ill be comp letely obvious necessarily, but it w ill be 
a fa irly easy situation. So, the general method is you look at your region, R, and it 
might have various sides. 

Well, on each side you ask yourself, what do I know about x and y, and how to 
convert that in terms of u and v? And maybe you'll find that the equation might be 
just u equals zero for examp le, or u equa ls v, or something like that. And then, it's 
up to you to decide what you want to do. But, maybe the easiest usua lly is to draw a 
new picture in terms of u and v coord inates of what your region will look like in the 
new coordinates. It might be that it w ill actually much easier. It should be easier 
looking than what you started w ith. 

OK, so  that's the general idea. There is one change of variab le prob lem on each of 
the two practice exams to give you a  feeling  for what's realistic. The prob lem that's 
on practice exam 3B actually is on the hard side of things because the question is 
kind of hidden in a way. So, if you  look at prob lem six, you might find  that it's not 
telling you very clearly what you have to do. That's because it was meant to be the 
hardest problem on that test. 

But, once you've reduced it to an actual change of variab les problem, I expect you to 
be ab le to know how to do it. And, on practice exam 3A, there's a lso, I think it's 
problem five on the other practice exam. And, that one is actually pretty standard 
and straightforward. OK, time to move on, sorry. So, we've also seen about line 
integrals. OK, so line integra ls, so the main thing to know about them, so the line 
integral for work, which is line integral of F.dr, so let's say that your vector field has 
components, M and N. So, the line integra l for work becomes in coord inates integra l 
of Mdx plus Ndy while we've a lso seen line integral for flux. 

So, line integral of F.n ds becomes the integral along C just to make sure that I g ive 
it to you correctly. So, remember that just, I don't want to make the mistake in  front 
of you. So, T ds is dx, dy. And, the norma l vector, so, T ds goes a long the curve. Nds 
goes clockw ise perpendicular to the curve. So, it's going to be, well, it's going to be 
dy and negative dx. So, you w ill be integrating negative Ndx plus Mdy. 

OK, see, if you are blanking and don't remember the signs, then you can just draw 
this picture and make sure that you get it right. So, you should know a little bit 
about geometric interpretation and how to see easily that it's going to be zero in 
some cases. But, mostly you should know how to compute, set up and compute 
these things. So, what do we do when we are here? Well, it's year, we have both x 
and y together, but we want to, because it's the line integra l, there should be only 
one variable. So, the important thing to know is we want to reduce everything to a 
sing le parameter. 

OK, so  the evaluation method is always by reducing  to a single parameter. So,  for 
example, maybe x and y are both functions of some variab le, t, and then express 
everything in terms of some integral of, some quantity involving t dt. It could be that 
you will just express everything in terms of x or in terms of y, or in terms of some 
angle or something. It's up to you to choose how to parameterize things. And then, 
when you're there, it's a usual one variable integral with a single variable in there. 

OK, so  that's the general method of ca lculation, but we've seen a shortcut for work 
when we can show that the field is the grad ient of potentia l. So, one thing to know is 
if the curl of F, which is an x minus My happens to be zero, well, and now I can say, 
and the domain is simply connected, or if the field is defined everywhere, then F is 
actually a grad ient field. So, that means, just to make it more concrete, that means 
we can find a  function little f called the potential such that its derivative respect to x 
is M, and its derivative with respect to Y is N. 

We can solve these two cond itions for the same function, f, simultaneously. And, 
how do we find this function, little f? OK, so that's the same as saying that the field, 
big F, is the gradient of little f. And, how do we find this function, little f? Well, we've 
seen two methods. One of them involves computing a line integral from the origin to 
a point in the p lane by going first a long the x axis, then vertica lly. 

The other method was to first figure out what this one tells us by integrating it w ith 
respect to x. And  then, we d ifferentiate our answer w ith respect to y, and we 
compare with that to get the comp lete answer. OK, so I is that relevant? Well, first of 
all it's relevant in physics, but it's a lso relevant just to ca lculation of line integra ls 
because we see the fundamenta l theorem of ca lculus for line integrals which says if 
we are integrating a gradient field and we know what the potentia l is. 

Then, we just have to, well, the line integra l is just the change in va lue of a 
potential. OK, so we take the value of a potentia l at the starting point, sorry, we take 
value potential at the endpoint minus the va lue at the starting point. And, that will 
give us the line integral, OK? So, important: this is only for work. There's no 
statement  like that for flux, OK, so don't tried to fly this in a problem about flux. I 
mean, usually, if you look at the practice exams, you will see it's pretty clear that 
there's one problem in which you are supposed  to do things this way. It's kind of a 
dead g iveaway, but it's probably not too bad. 

OK, and the other thing we've seen, so I mentioned it at the beg inning but let me 
mention it aga in. To compute things, Green's theorem, let's just compute, well,  let 
us forget, sorry, find the va lue of a line integra l along the closed curve by reducing it 
to double integral. So, the one for work says -- -- this, and you should  remember 
that in there, so C is a closed curve that goes counterclockwise, and R is the region 
inside. So, the way you would, if you had to compute both sides separately, you 
would do them in extremely d ifferent ways, right? This one is a line integral. So, you 
use the method to explain here, namely, you express x and y in terms of a sing le 
variable. See that you're doing a circle. I want to see a theta. I don't want to see an 
R. R is not a variab le. You are on the circle. This one is a double integra l. So, if you 
are doing it, say, on a disk, you would have both R and theta if you're using polar 
coordinates. You would have both x and y. 

Here, you have two variab les of integration. Here, you should have only one after 
you parameterize the curve. And, the fact that it stays curl F, I mean, curl F is just 
Nx-My is just like any function of x and y. OK, the fact that we ca lled it curl F doesn't 
change how you compute it. You have first to compute the curl of F. Say you  find, I 
don't know, xy minus x squared, well, it becomes just the usual doub le integral of 
the usual function xy minus x squared. 

There's nothing specia l to it because it's a curl. And, the other one is the counterpart 
for flux. So, it says this, and  remember this is mx p lus ny. I mean, what's important 
about these statements is not only remembering, you know, if you just know  this 
formula by heart, you are still in trouble because you need to know what actua lly the 
symbols in here mean. So, you should remember, what  is this line integral, and 
what's the divergence of a  field? So, just something to remember. And, so I guess I'll 
let you figure out practice problems because it's time, but I think that's basically the 
list of a ll we've seen. And, well, that should be it. 

So, again, I w ill have office hours now, tomorrow, and otherwise, good luck on the 
test.
