Transcript â€“ Lecture 13 

Let me start w ith a few announcements. The first one I am sure you already know. 
There are no classes on Monday and Tuesday, Columbus Day holiday, so that means 
there is no recitation on Monday, no lecture on Tuesday, there is a recitation on 
Wednesday, there  is a lecture on Thursday. Now, that means two d ifferent things. 
One of them will be I will be away during the weekend, so unfortunately I will not be 
able to have office hours this coming Tuesday and Wednesday. You should check 
with your recitation instruction and see which instructors will be around and help 
yourselves. I am sorry about that. And the other thing is there is still p lenty of time 
before the next exam in the class. It is on Tuesday, October 16. That is in a week 
and a half. 

But,  if you happen to want to use the long weekend to start reviewing, then I have 
put the two practice exams on the webpage in case you want to start looking at 
them. The only thing is there is still one top ic that we haven't seen, that we w ill see 
in lecture on Thursday, so you cannot do yet the last problem on each practice 
exam. You can do a ll but the last problem on each of the two practice exams, if you 
want to start studying. Anyway. 

We will have a  review session in class next Friday to go over one of the practice 
exams. You don't have to do it in advance, but if you want to  then you can. Last time 
we saw things about grad ients and directional derivatives. Before that we studied 
how to look for minima and maxima of functions of several variables. And today we 
are going to look again at min/max prob lems but in a d ifferent setting, namely, one 
for variab les that are not independent. And so what we w ill see is you may have 
heard of Lagrange multipliers. And this is the one point in the term when I can shine 
with my French accent and say Lagrange's name properly. 

OK. What are Lagrange multip liers about? Well,  the goal is to minimize or maximize 
a function of severa l variab les. Let's say,  for example, f of x, y, z, but where these 
variables are no longer independent. They are not independent. That means that 
there is a relation between them. The relation is maybe some equation of the form g 
of x, y, z equa ls some constant. You take the relation between x, y, z, you ca ll that g 
and that gives you the constraint. And your goal is to minimize f only of those values 
of x, y, z that satisfy the constraint. 

What is one way to do that? Well, one to do that, if the constraint is very simple, we 
can maybe solve for one of the variables. Maybe we can solve this equation for one 
of the variables, p lug it back into f, and then we have a usua l min/max prob lem that 
we have seen how to do. The problem  is sometimes you cannot actually solve for x, 
y, z in here because this condition is too comp licated and then we need a new 
method. That is what we are going to do. 

Why would we care about that? Well, one example is actua lly in physics. Maybe you 
have seen in thermodynamics that you study quantities about gases, and those 
quantities that involve pressure, volume and temperature. And pressure, volume and 

temperature are not independent of each other. I mean you know probably the 
equation PV = NRT. And, of course, there you could actua lly solve to express things 
in terms of one or the other. But sometimes it is more convenient to keep all three 
variables but treat them as constra ined. It is just an example of a situation where 
you might want to do this. 

Anyway, we will look mostly at particular examp les, but just to point out that this is 
useful when you study guesses in physics. The first observation is we cannot use our 
usua l method of  looking for critical points of f. Because critical points of f typ ica lly 
will not satisfy this condition and so won't be good solutions. We need something 
else. Let's look at an example, and we will see how that leads us to the method. For 
example, let's say that I want to find the point closest to the origin --

-- on the hyperbola xy equals 3 in the plane. That means I have this hyperbola, and 
I am asking myself what  is the point on it that is the closest to the origin? I mean we 
can solve this by elementary geometry, we don't need actua lly Lagrange multip liers, 
but we are going to do  it with Lagrange multip liers because it is a pretty good 
example. What does it mean? Well, it means that we want to minimize distance to 
the origin. What is the distance to the origin? If I have a point, at coordinates (x, y) 
and then the distance to the origin is square root of x squared p lus y squared. Well, 
do we really want to minimize that or can we minimize something easier? 

Yeah. Maybe we can minimize the square of a distance. Let's forget this guy and 
instead -- Actually, we will minimize f of x, y equals x squared plus y squared, that 
looks better, subject to the constraint xy = 3. And so we w ill call this thing g of x, y 
to illustrate the general method. Let's look at a picture. Here you can see in yellow 
the hyperbola xy equa ls three. And we are going to look for the points that are the 
closest to the origin. What can we do? 

Well, for example, we can p lot the function x squared plus y squared, function f. That 
is the contour plot of f with a hyperbola on top of it. Now  let's see what we can do 
with that. Well, let's ask ourselves, for example, if I look at points where f equals 20 
now. I think I am at 20 but you cannot rea lly see it. That is a circle w ith a point 
whose distant square is 20. Well, can I find a solution if I am on the hyperbola? Yes, 
there are four points at this d istance. Can I do better? Well, let's decrease for 
distance. Yes, we can still find points on the hyperbola and so on. Except if we go too 
low then there are no points on this circle anymore in the hyperbola. If we decrease 
the value of f that we want to look at that will somehow limit value beyond which we 
cannot go, and that is the minimum of f. 

We are trying to look for the smallest value of f that will actua lly be realized on the 
hyperbola. When does that happen? Well, I have to backtrack a little bit. It seems 
like the limiting case is basica lly here. It is when the circle is tangent to the 
hyperbola. That is the sma llest circle that w ill hit the hyperbola. If I take a larger 
value of f, I w ill have solutions. If I take a smaller value of f, I w ill not have any 
solutions anymore. So, that is the situation that we want to solve for. How do we 
find that minimum? Well, a key observation that is va lid on this p icture, and that 
actually remain true in the comp letely genera l case, is that when we have a 
minimum the level curve of f is actually tangent to our hyperbola. 

It is tangent to the set of points where x, y equa ls three, to  the hyperbola. Let's 
write that down. We observe that at the minimum the level curve of f is tangent to 
the hyperbola. Remember, the hyperbola is g iven by the equal g equals three, so it 

is a level curve of g. We have a level curve of f and a level curve of g that are 
tangent to each other. And I cla im that is going  to be the general situation that we 
are interested in. How do we try to solve for points where this happens? 

How do we find x, y where the level curves of f and g are tangent to each other? 
Let's think for a second. If the two level curves are tangent to each other that means 
they have the same tangent line. That means that the norma l vectors should be 
parallel. Let me maybe draw a picture here. This is the level curve maybe f equa ls 
something. And this is the level curve g equa ls constant. Here my constant is three. 
Well, if I look for gradient vectors, the gradient of f will be perpendicular to the level 
curve of f. The grad ient of g w ill be perpend icular to the level curve of g. They don't 
have any reason to be of the same size, but they have to be para llel to each other. 
Of course, they could also be para llel pointing in opposite d irections. 

But the key point  is that when this happens the gradient of f is parallel to the 
gradient of g. Well, let's check that. Here is a point. And I can p lot the gradient of f 
in b lue. The gradient of g in yellow. And you see, in most of these p laces, somehow 
the two grad ients are not rea lly para llel. Actua lly, I should not be looking at random 
points. I should be looking only on the hyperbola. I want points on the hyperbola 
where the two gradients are para llel. Well, when does that happen? Well, it looks like 
it will happen here. When I am at a minimum, the two gradient vectors are parallel. 
It is not really proof. 

It is an examp le that seems to be convincing. So far things work pretty well. How do 
we decide if two vectors are para llel? Well, they are parallel when they are 
proportional to each other. You can write one of them as a constant times the other 
one, and that constant usua lly one uses the Greek  letter lambda. I don't know if you 
have seen it before. It is the Greek  letter for L. And probab ly, I am sure,  it is 
somebody's idea of paying tribute to Lagrange by putting an L in there. Lambda is 
just a constant. And we are looking for a scalar lambda and points x and y where this 
holds. 

In fact, what we are doing is replacing min/max problems  in two variables with a 
constra int between them by a set of equations involving, you will see, three 
variables. We had min/max w ith two variables x, y, but no independent. We had a 
constra int g of x, y equa ls constant. And that becomes something new. That 
becomes a system of equations where we have to solve, well, let's write down what 
it means for gradient f to be proportional to gradient g. That means that f sub x 
should be lambda times g sub x, and  f sub y should be lambda times g sub y. 

Because the gradient vectors here are f sub x, f sub y and g sub x, g sub y. If you 
have a third variable z then you have a lso an equation f sub z equa ls lambda g sub 
z. Now, let's see. How many unknowns do we have  in these equations? Well, there is 
x, there is y and there is lambda. We have three unknowns and have only two 
equations. Something is missing. Well, I mean x and y are not actua lly independent. 
They are related by the equation g of x, y equa ls c, so we need to add the constra int 
g equals c. And now we have three equations involving three variab les. Let's see how 
that works. 

Here remember we have f equals x squared y squared and g = xy. What is f sub x? 
It is going to be 2x equals lambda times, what is g sub x, y. Maybe I should write 
here f sub x equals lambda g sub x just to remind you. Then we have f sub y equals 
lambda g sub y. F sub y is 2y equals lambda times g sub y is x. And then our third 

equation g equals c becomes xy equals three. So, that is what you would have to 
solve. Any questions at this point? No. Yes? 

How do I know the direction of a gradient? Do you mean how do I know that it is 
perpendicular to a level curve? Oh, how do I know if it points in that d irection on the 
opposite one? Well, that depends. I mean we'd seen in last time, but the grad ient is 
perpendicular to the level and points towards higher va lues of a function. So it could 
be -- Wa it. What d id I have? It could be that my grad ient vectors up there actua lly 
point  in opposite directions. It doesn't matter to me because it w ill still look the same 
in terms of the equation, just  lambda will be positive or negative, depend ing on the 
case. I can handle both situations. It's not a problem. I can a llow lambda to be 
positive or negative. Well, in this example, it looks like lambda will be positive. 

If you look at the p icture on the plot. Yes? Well, because actually they are not equal 
to each other. If you  look at this point where the hyperbola and the circle touch each 
other, first of all, I don't know which circle I am going to look at. I am trying to 
solve, actua lly, for the radius of the circle. I am  trying to find what the minimum 
value of f is. And, second, at that point, the va lue of f and the va lue of g are not 
equa l. g is equal to three because I want the hyperbola x equa ls three. The va lue of f 
will be the square of a d istance, whatever that is. I think it w ill end up being 6, but 
we will see. So, you cannot really set them equa l because you don't know what f is 
equa l to in advance. Yes? 

Not quite. Actua lly, here I am just using this idea of finding a point closest to the 
orig in to illustrate an example of a min/max problem. The general problem we are 
trying to solve  is minimize f sub ject to g equa ls constant. And what we are going to 
do for that  is we are rea lly going to say instead let's look at p laces where gradient f 
and gradient g are parallel to each other and solve for equations of that. 

I think we comp letely lose the notion of closest point  if we just look at these 
equations. We don't rea lly say anything about closest points anymore. Of course, 
that is what they mean in the end. But, in the general setting, there is no closest 
point  involved anymore. OK. Yes? Yes. It  is always going to be the case that, at the 
minimum, or at the maximum of a  function subject to a constraint, the  level curves 
of f and the  level curves of g will be tangent to each other. That is the basis for this 
method. I am going to justify that soon. It could be minimum or maximum. In three-
dimensions it could even be a sadd le point. And, in  fact, I should say in advance, this 
method w ill not tell us whether it is a minimum or a maximum. 

We do not have any way of knowing, except for testing va lues. We cannot use 
second derivative tests or anything like that. I w ill get back to  that. Yes? Yes. Here 
you can set y equals to  favor x. Then you can minimize x squared plus nine over x 
squared. In general, if I am trying to solve a more complicated prob lem, I might not 
be ab le to solve. I am doing an examp le where,  indeed, here you could solve and 
remove one variable, but you cannot always do  that. And this method w ill still work. 
The other one won't. OK. 

I don't see any other questions. Are there any other questions? No. OK. I see a lot of 
students stretching and so on, so it is very confusing for me. How do we solve these 
equations? Well, the answer is in general we might be in deep troub le. There is no 
general method for solving the equations that you get from this method. You just 
have to think about them. Sometimes it will be very easy. Sometimes it will be so 

hard that you cannot actually do it without the computer. Sometimes it w ill be just 
hard enough to be on Part B of this week's problem set. 

I cla im in this case we can actually do it w ithout so much trouble, because actua lly 
we can think of this as a two by two linear system in x and y. Well, let me do 
something. Let me rewrite the first two equations as 2x - lambda y = 0. And lambda 
x - 2y = 0. And xy = 3. That is what we want to solve. Well, I can put this into 
matrix form. Two minus lambda, lambda minus two times x, y equals 0, 0. Now, how 
do I solve a linear system matrix times x, y equals zero? Well, I always have an 
obvious solution. X and y both equal to zero. Is that a good solution? No, because 
zero times zero is not three. We want another solution, the trivia l solution. 

0, 0 does not solve the constraint equation xy equals three, so we want another 
solution. When do we have another solution? Well, when the determinant of a matrix 
is zero. We have other solutions that exist only if determinant of a matrix is zero. M 
is this guy. Let's compute the determinant. Well, that seems to be negative four p lus 
lambda squared. That is zero exactly when lambda squared equals four, which is 
lambda is p lus or minus two. Already you see here it is a the level of difficulty that is 
a little b it much for an exam but perfectly fine for a prob lem set or for a beautiful 
lecture like this one. How do we dea l with --

Well, we have two cases to  look at. Lambda equals two or lambda equals minus two. 
Let's start with lambda equals two. If I set lambda equals two, what does this 
equation become? Well, it becomes x equals y. This one becomes y equals x. Well, 
they seem to be the same. x equals y. And then the equation xy equa ls three 
becomes, well, x squared equals three. I have two solutions. One is x equals root 
three and, therefore, y equals root three as well, or negative root three and negative 
root three. Let's look at the other case. If I set lambda equa l to negative two then I 
get 2x equals negative 2y. That means x equa ls negative y. 

The second one, 2y equa ls negative 2x. That is y equa ls negative x. Well, that is the 
same thing. And xy equals three becomes negative x squared equa ls three. Can we 
solve that? No. There are no solutions here. Now we have two cand idate points 
which are these two points, root three, root three or negative root three, negative 
root three. OK. Let's actua lly look at what we have here. Maybe you cannot read the 
coordinates, but the point that I have here is indeed root three, root three. How do 
we see that lambda equa ls two? Well, if you look at this picture, the grad ient of f, 
that is the blue vector, is indeed twice the yellow vector, gradient g. That is where 
you read the va lue of lambda. 

And we have the other solution which is somewhere here. Negative root three, 
negative root there. And there, again, lambda equals two. The two vectors are 
proportional by a factor of two. Yes? No, solutions are not quite guaranteed to be 
absolute minima or maxima. They are guaranteed to be somehow critica l points end 
of a constraint. That means if you were able to solve and eliminate the variable that 
would be a critica l point. When you have the same problem, as we have critica l 
points, are they maxima or minima? And the answer is, well, we won't know until we 
check. 

More questions? No. Yes? What is a Lagrange multiplier? Well,  it is this number 
lambda that is called the multiplier here. It is a multip lier because it is what you 
have to multiply grad ient of g by to get grad ient of f. It multip lies. Let's try to see 
why is this method valid? Because so far I have shown you p ictures and have sa id 

see they are tangent. But why is it that they have to be tangent in genera l? Let's 
think about it. Let's say that we are at constra ined min or max. 

What that means is that if I move on the level g equals constant then the value of f 
should only  increase or only decrease. But it means, in particular, to first order it will 
not change. At an unconstra ined min or max, partial derivatives are zero. In this 
case, derivatives are zero only in the a llowed directions. And the a llowed directions 
are those that stay on the levels of this g equals constant. 

In any d irection a long the level set g = c the rate of change of f must be zero. That 
is what happens at minima or maxima. Except here, of course, we look only at the 
allowed directions. Let's say the same thing in terms of directiona l derivatives. That 
means for any d irection that is tangent to the constra int  level g equal c, we must 
have df over ds in the direction of u equa ls zero. I will draw a picture. Let's say now I 
am in three variab les just to give you d ifferent examp les. 

Here I have a level surface g equals c. I am at my point. And if I move in any 
direction that is on the level surface, so I move in the d irection u tangent to the level 
surface, then the rate of change of f in that direction should be zero. Now, remember 
what the formula is for this guy. Well, we have seen that this guy is actually radiant f 
dot u. That means any such vector u must be perpendicular to the gradient of f. 

That means that the gradient of f should be perpend icular to anything that is tangent 
to this level. That means the gradient of f should be perpendicular to the level set. 
That  is what we have shown. But we know another vector that is also perpend icular 
to the level set of g. That is the grad ient of g. We conclude that the gradient of f 
must be parallel to the gradient of g because both are perpend icular to the level set 
of g. 

I see confused faces, so let me try to  tell you again where that comes from. We said 
if we had a constra ined minimum or maximum, if we move in the level set of g, f 
doesn't change. Well,  it doesn't change to first order. It is the same idea as when 
you are looking for a minimum you set the derivative equa l to zero. So the derivative 
in any d irection,  tangent to g equa ls c, should be the directional derivative of f, in 
any such d irection, should be zero. 

That  is what we mean by critica l point of f. And so that means that any vector u, any 
unit vector tangent to the  level set of g is going  to be perpend icular to  the grad ient 
of f. That means that the gradient of f is perpendicular to the level set of g. If you 
want, that means the level sets of f and g are tangent to each other. That is 
justifying what we have observed in the picture that the two level sets have to be 
tangent to each other at the prime minimum or maximum. Does that make a little b it 
of sense? Kind of. I see at least a few faces nodding so I take that to be a positive 
answer. 

Since I have been asked by several of you, how do I know  if it is a maximum or a 
minimum? Well, warning, the method doesn't tell whether a solution is a minimum or 
a maximum. How do we do it? Well, more bad news. We cannot use the second 
derivative test. And the reason  for that is that we care actually only about these 
specific directions that are tangent to variable of g. And we don't want to bother to 
try to define directional second derivatives. Not to mention that actually it wouldn't 
work. There is a criterion but it is much more complicated than that. Basica lly, the 
answer for us is that we don't have a second derivative test in this situation. What 

are we left with? Well, we are just left w ith comparing values. Say that in this 
problem you found a point where f equa ls three, a point where f equa ls nine, a point 
where f equals 15. Well, then probably the minimum is the point where f equa ls 
three and the maximum is 15. 

Actually, in this case, where we found minima, these two points are tied for 
minimum. What about the maximum? What is the maximum of f on the hyperbola? 
Well, it is infinity because the point can go as far as you want from the origin. But 
the general  idea is if we have a good reason to believe that there should be a 
minimum, and it's not like at  infinity or something weird like that, then the minimum 
will be a solution of the Lagrange multiplier equations. 

We just  look for all the solutions and then we choose the one that gives us the 
lowest va lue. Is that good enough? Let me actually write that down. To find the 
minimum or the maximum, we compare values of f at the various solutions -- -- to 
Lagrange multiplier equations. I should say a lso that sometimes you can just 
conclude by thinking geometrically. In this case, when it is asking you which point is 
closest to the origin you can just see that your answer is the correct one. Let's do an 
advanced examp le. Advanced means that --

Well, this one I didn't actually dare to put on top of the other problem sets. Instead, 
I am going to do it. What is this going to be about? We are going to look for a 
surface minimiz ing pyramid. Let's say that we want to build a pyramid w ith a given 
triangular base -- -- and a given volume. Say that I have maybe in the x, y plane I 
am g iving you some triangle. And  I am going to try to build a pyramid. 

Of course, I can choose where to put the top of a pyramid. This guy w ill end up being 
behind now. And the constraint and the goa l is to minimize the tota l surface area. 
The first time I taught this class, it was a  few years ago, was just before they built 
the Stata Center. And then I used to motivate this prob lem by saying Frank Gehry 
has gone crazy and has been given a triangular plot of land he wants to put a 
pyramid. There needs to be the right amount of volume so that you can put a ll the 
offices in there. And he wants it to be, actually, covered in solid gold. And because 
that is expensive, the administration wants him  to cut the costs a bit. 

And so you have to minimize the tota l size so that it doesn't cost too much. We will 
see if MIT comes up w ith a triangular pyramid build ing. Hopefully not. It could be our 
next dorm, you never know. Anyway, it is a fine geometry problem. Let's try to think 
about how we can do this. The natura l way to think about it would be -- Well, what 
do we have to look for first? We have to look for the position of that top point. 
Remember we know that the volume of a pyramid is one-third the area of base times 
height. In fact, fixing the volume, knowing that we have fixed the area of a base, 
means that we are fixing the height of the pyramid. 

The height is completely fixed. What we have to choose just is where do we put that 
top point? Do we put  it smack in the midd le of a triangle or to a side or even 
anywhere we want? Its z coord inate is fixed. Let's ca ll h the height. What we could 
do is something like this. We say we have three points of a base. Let's call them p1 
at (x1, y1, 0); p2 at (x2, y2, 0); p3 at (x3, y3, 0). This point p is the unknown point 
at (x, y, h). 

We know the height. And then we want to minimize the sum of the areas of these 
three triangles. One here, one here and one at the back. And areas of triangles we 

know how to express by using length of cross-product. It becomes a function of x 
and y. And you can try to minimize it. Actua lly, it doesn't quite work. The formulas 
are just too complicated. You w ill never get there. What happens  is actua lly maybe 
we need better coordinates. Why do we need better coord inates? That is because the 
geometry is kind of d ifficult to do if you use x, y coordinates. I mean formula for 
cross-product is fine, but then the length of the vector w ill be annoying and just 
doesn't look good. Instead, let's think about it differently. 

I cla im if we do  it this way and we express the area as a function of x, y, well, 
actually we can't solve for a minimum. Here is another way to do it. Well, what has 
worked pretty well for us so  far is this geometric idea of base times height. So let's 
think in terms of the heights of side triangles. I am going to use the height of these 
things. And I am going to say that the area w ill be the sum of three terms, which are 
three bases times three heights. Let's give names to these quantities. Actually, for 
that it is going to be good to have the point in the xy plane that lives directly below 
p. Let's ca ll it q. P is the point that coordinates x, y, h. 

And let's ca ll q the point that is just below it and so it' coordinates are x, y, 0. Let's 
see. Let me draw a map of this thing. p1, p2, p3 and I have my point q in the 
middle. Let's see. To know these areas, I need to know the base. Well, the base I 
can decide that I know it because it is part of my g iven data. I know the sides of this 
triangle. Let me call the lengths a1, a2, a3. I a lso need to know the height, so I need 
to know these lengths. How do I know these lengths? Well, its distance in space, but 
it is a little bit annoying. But maybe I can reduce it to a distance in the plane by 
looking instead at this distance here. 

Let me give names to the d istances from q to the sides. Let's call u1, u2, u3 the 
distances from q to the sides. Well, now I can claim I can find, actua lly, sorry. I need 
to draw one more thing. I claim I have a nice formula for the area, because this is 
vertical and this is horizontal so this length here is u3, this length here is h. So what 
is this length here? It  is the square root of u3 squared plus h squared. And similarly 
for these other guys. They are square roots of a u squared plus h squared. The 
heights of the faces are square root of u1 squared times h squared. And similarly 
with u2 and u3. 

So the total side area is going to be the area of the first faces, one-ha lf of base times 
height, p lus one-half of a base times a height p lus one-ha lf of the third one. It 
doesn't look so much better. But, trust me, it w ill get better. Now, that is a  function 
of three variab les, u1, u2, u3. And how do we relate u1, u2, u3 to each other? They 
are probab ly not independent. Well, let's cut this triang le here into three pieces like 
that. Then each p iece has side --

Well, let's look at it the piece of the bottom. It has base a3, height u3. Cutting base 
into  three tells you that the area of a base is one-ha lf of a1, u1 p lus one-ha lf of a2, 
u2 p lus one-ha lf of a3, u3. And that is our constraint. My three variables, u1, u2, u3, 
are constrained in this way. The sum of this figure must be the area of a base. And I 
want to minimize that guy. So that is my g and  that guy here is my f. Now we try to 
apply our Lagrange multiplier equations. Well, partial f of a partial u1 is --

Well, if you do the ca lculation, you w ill see it is one-half a1, u1 over square root of 
u1^2 plus h^2 equals lambda, what is partia l g, partia l a1? That one you can do, I 
am sure. It is one-half a1. Oh, these guys simplify. If you do the same with the 
second one -- -- things simplify again. And the same w ith the third one. Well, you 

will get, after simplifying, u3 over square root of u3 squared p lus h squared equals 
lambda. Now, that means this guy equa ls this guy equals this guy. They are a ll equal 
to lambda. And, if you think about it, that means that u1 = u2 = u3. 

See, it looked like scary equations but the solution is very simp le. What does it 
mean? It means that our point q should be equidistant from all three sides. That is 
called the incenter. Q should be in the incenter. The next time you have to build a 
golden pyramid and don't want to go broke, well, you know where to put the top. If 
that was a bit fast, sorry. Anyway,  it is not completely crucia l. But go over it and you 
will see it works. Have a nice weekend.
