Transcript â€“ Lecture 31 

Recall that yesterday we saw, no, two days ago we learned about the curl of a vector 
field in space. And we sa id the curl of F is defined by taking a cross product between 
the symbol dell and the vector F. Concretely, the way we would compute this would 
be by putting the components of F into this determinant and expand ing and then 
getting a vector with components Ry minus Qz, Pz minus Rx and Qx minus Py. 

I think I a lso tried to exp lain very quickly what the significance of a curl is. Just to 
tell you again very quickly, basically curl measures, if you mention that your vector 
field measures the velocity in some fluid then the curl measures how much rotation 
is taking p lace in that fluid. Measures the rotation part of a velocity field. More 
precisely the d irection corresponds to the axis of rotation and the magnitude 
corresponds to twice the angular velocity. 

Just to g ive you a few quick examples. If I take a constant vector field, so everything 
translates at the same speed, then obviously when you take the partia l derivatives 
you will just get a bunch of zeros so the curl will be zero. If you take a vector field 
that stretches things, let's say, for example, we are going to stretch things along the 
x-axis, that would be a vector field that goes parallel to the x d irection but maybe, 
say, x times i. 

So that when you are in front of a plane of a blackboard you are moving  forward, 
when you are behind you are moving backwards, things are getting expanded in the 
x d irection. If you compute the curl, you can check each of these. Aga in, they are 
going to be zero. There  is no curl. This is not what curl measures. I mean, actually, 
what measures expansion, stretching is actua lly divergence. If you take the 
divergence of this field, you would get one plus zero p lus zero,  it looks like it w ill be 
one, so in case you don't remember, I mean d ivergence precisely measures this 
stretching effect in your field. And, on the other hand, if you take something that 
corresponds to, say, rotation about the z-axis at unit angular velocity --

That means they are going to moving in circles around the z-axis. One way to write 
down this field, let's see, the z component is zero because everything is moving 
horizontally. And in the x and y directions, if you look at it from above, well, it is just 
going to be our good old  friend the vector field that rotates everything [at unit 
speed?]. And we have seen the formula for this one many times. The first 
component is minus y, the second one is x. Now, if you compute the curl of this guy, 
you will get zero, zero, two, two k. And so k is the axis of rotation, two  is tw ice the 
angular velocity. And now, of course, you can imagine much more complicated 
motions where you w ill have --

For example, if you look at the Charles River very carefully then you w ill see that 
water is flowing, genera lly speaking, towards the ocean. But, at the same time, there 
are actually a few eddies in there and with water sw irling. Those are the p laces 
where there is actually curl in the flow. Yes. I don't know how to turn out the lights a 
bit, but I'm sure there is a way. Does this do it? Is it working? OK. You're welcome. 

Hopefully it is easier to see now. That was about curl. Now, why do we care about 
curl besides this motivation of understand ing motions? One p lace where it comes up 
is when we try to understand whether a vector field is conservative. Remember we 
have seen that a vector field is conservative if and only if  its curl is zero. That is the 
situation  in which we are allowed to try to look for a potentia l function and then use 
the fundamental theorem. 

But another place where this comes up,  if you remember what we did in the plane, 
curl also came up when we tried to convert nine integra ls into double integrals. That 
was Greene's theorem. Well, it turns out we can do the same thing in space and that 
is called Stokes' theorem. What does Stokes' theorem say? It says that the work 
done by a vector field a long a closed curve can be replaced by a double integral of 
curl F. Let me write it using the dell notation. That is curl F. Dot ndS on a suitab ly 
chosen surface. That is a very strange kind of statement. 

But actually it is not much more strange than things we have seen before. I should 
clarify what this means. C has to be a closed curve  in space. And S can be any 
surface bounded by C. For example, what Stokes' theorem tells me is that let us say 
that I have to compute some line integral on maybe, say, the unit circle in the x, y 
plane. Of course I can set a line integra l d irectly and compute it by setting x equa ls 
cosine T, y equals sine T, z equals zero. 

But maybe sometimes I don't want to do that because my vector field is really 
complicated. And instead I w ill want to reduce things to a surface integral. Now, I 
know that you guys are not necessarily fond of computing  flux of vector fields for 
surfaces so maybe you don't really see the point. But sometimes it  is useful. 
Sometimes it  is also useful backwards because, actually, you have a surface integra l 
that you would like to turn into a line integral. 

What Stokes' theorem says is that I can choose my favorite surface whose boundary 
is this circle. I could choose, for example, a half sphere  if I want or I can choose, 
let's call that s1, I don't know, a pointy thing, s2. Probably the most log ica l one, 
actually, would be just to choose a d isk in the x, y plane. That would probab ly be the 
easiest one to set up for calculating flux. Anyway, what Stokes' theorem tells me is I 
can choose any of these surfaces, whichever one I want, and I can compute the flux 
of curl F through this surface. Curl F is a new vector field when you have this formula 
that gives you a vector field you compute its flux through your favorite surface, and 
you should get the same thing as if you had done the line integra l for F. 

That  is the statement. Now, there is a catch here. What is the catch? Well, the catch 
is we have to figure out what conventions to use because remember when we have a 
surface there are two possib le orientations. We have to decide which way we will 
counter flux positively, which way we w ill counter flux negatively. And,  if we change 
our choice, then of course the flux will become the opposite. Well, similarly to define 
the work, I need to choose which way I am going to run my curve. If I change which 
way I go around the curve then my work w ill become the opposite. What happens is 
I have to orient the curve C and the surface S in compatible ways. We have to figure 
out what the rule is for how the orientation of S and that of C relate to each other. 

What about orientation? Well, we need the orientations of C and S to be compatible 
and they have to exp lain to you what the rule is. Let me show you a picture. The rule 
is if I walk along C with S to my left then the norma l vector is pointing up for me. Let 

me write that. If I wa lk along C, I should say in the positive direction, in the d irection 
that I have chosen to orient C. With S to my left then n is pointing up  for me. Here is 
the examp le. If I am walking on this curve, it looks like the surface is to my left. And 
so the normal vector is going towards what  is up for me. Any questions about that? I 
see some people using their right hands. That is also right-handab le which I am 
going to say in just a few moments. 

That  is another way to remember this. Before I tell you about the right-handab le 
version, let me just try something. Actually, I am not happy with this orientation of C 
and I want to orient my curve C going clockwise on the p icture. So the other 
orientation. Then, if I wa lk on it this way,  the surface would be to my right. You can 
remember, if it helps you, that if a surface is to your right then the norma l vector will 
go down. 

The other way to think about this rule is enough because if you are walking 
clockwise, well, you can change that to counterclockw ise just by walking upside 
down. This guy is walking clockw ise on C. And while for him, if you look carefully at 
the p icture, the surface is actually to his left when you flip upside down. Yeah, it is 
kind of confusing. But, anyway, maybe it's easier if you actually rotate in the picture. 
And now it is getting actually rea lly confusing because his walking upside up with, 
actually, the surface is to his left. I mean where he is at here  is actua lly at the front 
and this is the back, but that is kind of hard to see. 

Anyway, whichever method will work best for you. Perhaps it is easiest to first do it 
with the other orientation, this one, and this side, if you want the opposite one, then 
you will just flip everything. Now, what is the other way of remembering this with 
the right-hand rule? F irst of all, take your right hand, not your left. Even if your right 
hand is actually using a pen or something like that in your right hand do this. 

And let's take your fingers in order. F irst your thumb. Let's make your thumb go 
along the ob ject that has only one d imension in there. That  is the curve. Well, let's 
look at the top picture up there. I want my thumb to go a long the curve so that is 
kind of towards the right. Then I want to make my index finger point towards the 
surface. Towards the surface I mean towards the interior of the surface from the 
curve. And when I am on the curve I am on the boundary of the surface, so there is 
a direction along the surface that is the curve and the other one is pointing into the 
surface. That one would be pointing kind of to  the back slightly up maybe, so like 
that. And now your middle finger is going to point in the direction of the normal 
vector. 

That  is up, at  least  if you have the same kind of right hand as I do. The other way of 
doing it  is using the right-hand  rule along C positively. The index finger towards the 
interior of S. Sorry, I shouldn't say interior. I should say tangent to S towards the 
interior of S. What I mean by that  is really the part of S that is not its boundary, so 
the rest of the surface. Then the midd le finger points parallel to n. 

Let's practice. Let's say that I gave you this curve bound ing this surface. Which way 
do you think the normal vector w ill be going? Up. Yes. Everyone  is voting up. 
Imaging that I am walking around C. That is to my left. Normal vector points up. 
Imagine that you put your thumb a long C, your index towards S and then your 
middle finger points up. Very good. N points up. Another one. It is interesting to 
watch you guys. I think mostly it is going up. The correct answer is it goes up and 
into  the cone. How do we see that? Well, one way to think about it is imag ine that 

you are wa lking on C, on the rim of this cone. You have two options. Imagine that 
you are wa lking kind of inside or imag ine that you are walking kind of outside. 

If you are wa lking outside then S is to your right, but it does not sound good. Let's 
say instead that you are walking on the inside of a cone follow ing the boundary. 
Well, then the surface is to your left. And so the normal vector w ill be up for you 
which means it w ill be pointing slightly up and into the cone. Another way to think 
about it, through the right-hand  rule, from this way index going kind of down 
because the surface goes down and a b it to the back. 

And then the norma l vector points up and in. Yet another way, if you deform 
continuously your surface then the conventions will not change. See, this is kind of 
topology in a way. You can deform things and nothing will change. So what if we 
somehow flatten our cone, push it a bit up so that it becomes completely flat? Then, 
if you had a flat d isk with the curve going counterclockw ise, the norma l vector would 
go up. 

Now take your d isk with its normal vector sticking up. If you want to paint the face a 
different color so that you can remember that was beside with a norma l vector and 
then push it back down to the cone, you will see that the painted face, the one with 
the norma l vector on that side is the one that is  inside and up. Does that make 
sense? Anyway, I think you have just to p lay with these examples for long enough 
and get it. 

OK. The last one. Let's say that I have a cylinder. So now this guy has actually two 
boundary curves, C and C prime. And let's say I want to orient my cylinder so that 
the norma l vector sticks out. How should I choose the orientation of my curves? Let's 
start w ith, say, the bottom one. Would the bottom one be going clockw ise or 
counterclockwise. Most people seem to say counterclockwise, and I agree with that. 
Let me write that down and claim C prime should go counterclockw ise. One way to 
think about it, actually, it's quite easy, you mentioned that you're wa lking on the 
outside of the cylinder a long C prime. 

If you want to walk along C prime so that the cylinder is to your left, that means you 
have to actua lly go counterclockwise around it. The other way is use your right hand. 
Say when you're at the front of C prime, your thumb points to the right, your index 
points up because that's where the surface is, and then your midd le finger will point 
out. What about C? Well, C  I cla im we should be doing clockw ise. I mean think about 
just walking again on the surface of the cylinder along C. If you wa lk clockwise, you 
will see that the surface is to your left or use the right-hand rule. Now, if a problem 
gives you neither the orientation of a curve nor that of the surface then it's up to you 
to make them up. 

But you have to make them up in a consistent way. You cannot choose them both at 
random. All right. Now we're all set to try to use Stokes' theorem. Well, let me do an 
example first. The first example that I will do is actually a comparison. Stokes' 
versus Green. I want to show you how Green's theorem for work that we saw in the 
plane, but also involved work and curl and so on, is actua lly a special case of this. 
Let's say that we w ill look at the special case where our curve C is actua lly a curve in 
the x, y plane. 

And let's make it go counterclockw ise in the x, y plane because that's what we did 
for Green's theorem. Now let's choose a surface bounded by this curve. Well, as I 

said, I could make up any surface that comes to my mind. But, if I want to relate to 
this stuff, I should probably stay in the x, y plane. So I am just going to take my 
surface to be the piece of the x, y plane that is inside my curve. So let's say S is 
going to be a portion of x, y plane bounded by a curve C, and the curve C goes 
counterclockwise. 

Well, then I should look at [the tab le?]. For work a long C of my favorite vector field F 
dot dr. So that w ill be the line integra l of Pdx p lus Qdy. L ike I said, if I ca ll the 
components of my field P, Q and R, it w ill be Pdx p lus Qdy p lus Rdz, but I don't have 
any Z here. Dz is zero on C. If I evaluate for line integra l, I don't have any term 
involving dz. Z is zero. Now, let's see what Strokes says. Stokes says instead I can 
compute for flux through S of curve F. 

But now what's the normal vector to my surface? Well, it's going to be either k or 
negative k. I just have to  figure out which one  it is. Well, if you  followed what we've 
done there, you know that the norma l vector compatib le w ith this choice for the 
curve C is the one that points up. My normal vector is just going to be k hat, so I am 
going to replace my normal vector by k hat. That means, actually, I w ill be 
integrating curl dot k. That means I am integrating the z component of curl. Let's 
look at curl F dot k. 

That's the z component of curl F. And what's the z component of curl? Well, I 
conveniently still have the va lues up there. It's Q sub x minus P sub y. My doub le 
integral becomes double integral of Q sub x minus P sub y. What about dS? Well, I 
am in a p iece of the x, y p lane, so dS is just dxdy or your favorite combination that 
does the same thing. Now, see, if you look at this equality, integral of Pdx plus Qdy 
along a closed curve equals doub le integral of Qx minus Py dxdy. 

That  is exactly the statement of Green's theorem. I mean except at that time we 
called things m and n, but rea lly that shouldn't matter. This tells you that, in fact, 
Green's theorem is just a special case of Stokes' in the x, y plane. Now, another 
sma ll remark I want to make right away before I forget, you might think that these 
rules that we've made up about compatibility of orientations are completely 
arbitrary. 

Well, they are literally in the same way as our convention for which we guy curl is 
arbitrary. We chose to make the curl be this thing and not the opposite which would 
have been pretty much just as sensib le. And, ultimately,  that comes from our choice 
of making the cross-product be what it is but of the opposite. Ultimately, it all comes 
from our preference for right-handed coord inate systems. 

If we had been on the planet w ith  left-handed coord inate systems then actua lly our 
conventions would be a ll the other way around, but they are this way. Any other 
questions? A surface that you use in Stokes' theorem is usua lly not going to be 
closed because its boundary needs to be the curve C. So if you had a closed surface 
you wouldn't know where to put your curve. I mean of course you could make a tiny 
hole in it and get a tiny curve. Actually, what that would say, and we are going to 
see more about that so not very important right now, but what we would see is that 
for a close surface we would end up getting zero for the flux. 

And that is actually because divergence of curl is zero, but I am getting ahead of 
myself. We are going to see that probab ly tomorrow in more detail. Stokes' theorem 
only works if you can make sense of this. That means you need your vector field to 

be continuous and d ifferentiable everywhere on the surface S. Now, why is that 
relevant? Well, say that your vector field was not defined at the origin and say that 
you wanted to do, you know, the example that I had first w ith the unit circling the x, 
y p lane. Norma lly, the most sensible choice of surface to app ly Stokes' theorem to 
would be just the flat disk in the x, y plane. But that assumes that your vector field 
is well-defined there. If your vector field is not defined at the orig in but defined 
everywhere else you cannot use this guy, but maybe you can still use, say, the ha lf-
sphere, for example. 

Or, you could use a piece of cylinder plus a flat top or whatever you want but not 
pressing for the orig in. So you could still use Stokes but you'd have to be careful 
about which surface you choose. Now, if instead your vector field is not defined 
anywhere on the z-axis then you're out of luck because there is no way to find a 
surface bounded by this unit circle without crossing the z-axis somewhere. Then you 
wouldn't be ab le to Stokes' theorem at a ll or at least not d irectly. 

Maybe I should write it F defines a d ifferentiable everywhere on this. But we don't 
care about what happens outside of this. It's rea lly only on the surface that we need 
it to be OK. I mean, aga in, 99% of the vector fields that we see  in this class are 
defined everywhere so that's not an urgent concern, but still. OK. Should we move 
on? Yes. I have a yes. Let me expla in to you quickly why Stokes is true. 

How do we prove a theorem like that? Well, the strategy, I mean there are other 
ways, but the least painful strategy at this point is to observe what we already know 
is a specia l case of Stokes's theorem. Namely we know the case where the curve is 
actually in the x, y p lane and the surface is a flat piece of the x, y plane because 
that's Green's theorem which we proved a while ago. We know it for C and S  in the 
x, y plane. Now, what if C and S were, say,  in the y, z p lane instead of the x, y 
plane? Well, then it will not quite give the same picture because the norma l vector 
would be i hat instead of k hat and they would be having different notations and it 
would be integrating with y and z. 

But you see that it would become, again, exactly the same formula. We'd know it for 
any of the coordinate p lanes. In fact, I claim we know it for absolutely any plane. 
And the reason for that is, sure, when we write it in coordinates, when we write that 
this line integral  is integral of Pdx plus Qdy plus Rdz or when we write that the curl is 
given by this formula we use the x, y, z coord inate system. But there is something I 
haven't quite told you about. 

Which is if I sw itch to any other right-handed coordinate system, so I do some sort 
of rotation of my space coordinates, then somehow the line integral, the flux 
integral, the notion of curl makes sense in coord inates. And the reason is that they 
all have geometric interpretations. For example, when I think of this as the work 
done by a  force, well, the force doesn't care whether it's being put in x, y 
coordinates this way or that way. It still does the same work because it's the same 
force. 

And when I say that the curl measures the rotation in a motion, well, that depends 
on which coordinates you use. And the same for interpretation of flux. In fact, if I 
rotated my coord inates to  fit w ith any other plane, I could still do the same things. 
What I'm trying to say is,  in fact,  if C and S are in any plane then we can still claim 
that it reduces to Green's theorem. It will be Green's theorem not in x, y, z 

coordinates but in some funny rotated coordinate systems. What I'm saying  is that 
work, flux and curl makes sense independently of coordinates. 

Now, this has to stop somewhere. I can start cla iming that I can somehow bend my 
coordinates to a p lane, any surface is flat. That doesn't really work. But what I can 
say is if I have any surface I can cut it  into tiny pieces. And these tiny pieces are 
basically flat. So that's basica lly the idea of a proof. I am going to decompose my 
surface into very small flat p ieces. Given any S we are just going to decompose it 
into  tiny almost flat pieces. 

For example, if I have my surface like this, what I will do is I will just cut it into tiles. 
I mean a good examp le of that is if you  look at those geodesic things, for example, 
it's made of all these hexagons and pentagons. Well, actua lly, they're not quite flat 
in the usua l rule, but you could make them flat and it would still look pretty much 
like a sphere. Anyway, you're going to cut your surface into lots of tiny p ieces. And 
then you can use Stokes' theorem on each small piece. What it says on each sma ll 
flat p iece --

It says that the line  integral along say,  for example, this curve is equa l to the flux of 
a curl through this tiny piece of surface. And now I will add all of these terms 
together. If I add a ll of the small contributions to flux I get the tota l flux. What if I 
add all of the sma ll line integra ls? Well, I get lots of extra junk because I never 
asked to compute the  line integral along this. But this guy w ill come in tw ice when I 
do this little plate and when I do that little p late with opposite orientations. 

When I sum all of the little line integra ls together, all of the inner things cancel out, 
and the only ones that I go through only once are those that are at the outer most 
edges. So, when I sum a ll of my works together, I w ill get the work done just a long 
the outer boundary C. Sum of work around each little p iece is just actua lly the work 
along C, the outer curve. And the sum of the flux for each p iece is going to be the 
flux through S. 

From Stokes' theorem  for flat surfaces, I can get it for any surface. I am cheating a 
little bit because you would actua lly have to check carefully that this approximation 
where you flatten the little pieces that are a lmost flat is varied. But, trust me,  it 
actually works. Let's do an actua l example. I mean I said example, but that was 
more like getting us ready for the proof so probably that doesn't count as an actual 
example. I should probably keep these statements for now so I am not going to 
erase this side. 

Let's do an example. Let's try to find the work of vector field zi p lus xj p lus yk 
around the unit circle in the x, y plane counterclockwise. The picture  is conveniently 
already there. Just as a quick review, let's see how we do that d irectly. If we do that 
directly, I have to  find the integra l a long C. So F dot dr becomes zdx plus xdy plus 
ydz. But now we actually know that on this circle, well, z is zero. 

And we can parameterize x and y, the unit circle in the x, y plane, so we can take x 
equa ls cosine t, y equals sine t. That will just become the integral over C. Well, z 
times dx, z is zero so we have nothing, p lus x is cosine t times dy is -- Well, if y is 
sine t then dy is cosine tdt plus ydz but z is zero. Now,  the range of va lues for t, 
well, we are going counterclockwise around the entire circle so that should go  from 
zero to 2p i. 

We will get integra l from zero to 2pi of cosine square tdt which, if you do the 
calculation, turns out to be just p i. Now, let's instead try to use Stokes' theorem to 
do the calculation. Now, of course the smart choice would be to just take the flat unit 
disk. I am not going to do that. That would be too boring. Plus we have a lready kind 
of checked it because we a lready trust Green's theorem. Instead, just to convince 
you that, yes, I can choose rea lly any surface I want, let's say that I'm going to 
choose a p iece of paraboloid z equals one minus x squared minus y squared. 

Well, to get our conventions straight, we should take the normal vector pointing up 
for compatibility with our choice. Well, we w ill have to compute the flux through S. 
We don't rea lly have to because we could have chosen the d isk, it would be easier, 
but if we want to do it this way we will compute the flux of curl F through our 
paraboloid. How do we do that? Well, we need to find the curl and we need to find 
ndS. Let's start with the curl. Curl F let's take the cross-product between dell and F 
which is zxy. If we compute this, the i component will be one minus zero. 

It looks like it  is one i. M inus the j component is zero minus one. Plus the k 
component is one minus zero. In fact, the curl of the field is one, one, one. Now, 
what about ndS? Well, this is a surface for which we know z is a function of x and y. 
ndS we can write as, let's ca ll this F of xy, then we can use the formula that says 
ndS equals negative F sub x, negative F sub y, one dxdy, which here gives us 2x, 2y, 
one dxdy. 

Now, when we want to compute the flux, we will have to do double integral over S of 
one, one, one dot product w ith 2x, 2y, one dxdy. It w ill become the double integral 
of 2x p lus 2y p lus one dxdy. And, of course,  the region which we are integrating, the 
range of values of x and y will be the shadow of our surface. That is just going to be, 
if you look at this paraboloid from above, all you will see is the unit disk so it will be 
a doub le  integral of the unit disk. And the way we will do that, one way is to switch 
to polar coordinates and do the calculation and then you w ill end up with pi. 

The other way is to try to do  it by symmetry. Observe, when you integrate x above 
this, x is as negative on the left as it is positive on the right. So the integral of x will 
be zero. The integra l of y w ill be zero a lso by symmetry. Then the integra l of one 
dxdy will just be the area of this unit disk which  is pi. That was our first examp le. 
And, of course, if you're actually free to choose your favorite surface, there  is 
absolutely no reason why you would actually choose this paraboloid  in this example. 

I mean it would be much easier to choose a  flat disk. OK. Tomorrow I will tell you a 
few more things about curl fits in w ith conservativeness and w ith the d ivergence 
theorem, Stokes all together, and we will look at Practice Exam 4B so please bring 
the exam with you.
