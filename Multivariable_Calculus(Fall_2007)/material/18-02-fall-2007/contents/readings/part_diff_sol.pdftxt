one  sees t h a t   if  a  = 2,  f (x ,  y) = x2y  + 3xy2   is  a  function  with  t h e  given  f,  and   f,.

b)  w,  = -y2 /x2 ,   W,  = 2y lx ;   therefore  a t   (1,2,4), we  get  w,  = -4,  w,  = 4,  so 
t h a t   th e  tangent  plane  is  w = 4 - 4(x - 1 )  + 4(y - 2 ) ,  or  w = -4x  + 4y.

b) Th e  line  is  x  = x o t ,  y = yo t ,  z = zo t ;   substituting into th e  equations of  th e  cone 
and  the  tangent  plane,  both  a re  satisfied for  all values of  t ;  this  shows th e   line  lies on  both 
the   cone and  tangent  plane  (this can  also be  seen geometrically). 

2B -3   Letting  x ,  y, z  be  respectively  the   lengths  of  th e   two  legs  and  the   hypotenuse,  we 
have  z = I/-
thus  th e  calculation  of  partial  derivatives  is  th e  same as  in  2B -2 ,   and

a t   (1 ,2 ) ,  f x ( l , 2 )  = f y ( l ,2)  = 10,  f ( l , 2 )  = 25; 
linearization  is  10(x - 1) + 10(y - 2) + 25,  or  l o x  + 10y - 5.

bu t   this  point  is  not  in  R.  We  therefore  investigate  t h e  diagonal bounda ry   of  R ,  using  t h e  
parametrization  x  = t ,   y = - t .   Restricted t o  th is  line,  f (x ,  y) becomes a  function  of  t  alone, 
which  we  denote by  g ( t ) ,  and  we  look for  i t s  maxima  and  minima.

g ' ( t )  = 4t  - 2 ,   which  is  0 a t  t  = 112. 

This point  is evidently a minimum  for g ( t ) ;  there is no  maximum:  g ( t )  tends  t o  co. Therefore 
for  f (x ,  y)  on  R ,  t h e  minimum  occurs  a t  t h e  point  (112, -1 /2 ) ,   and   the re   is n o  maximum;

a )   On  t h e  two  sides  of  t h e  boundary,  t h e  function  f (x ,  y)  becomes  respectively 

Since t h e  function  is  linear  and  decreasing  on  bo th   sides,  i t  has  no  minimum  points  (infor-

t h e  maximum  of  f  on  t h e  first  quad ran t   is  m ,  so  t h a t   ( 1 , l )  must  be   a  saddle point.

Since  f (x ,  y)  is  thus   increasing or  decreasing  on  each  of  t h e  four  sides,  t h e  
maximum  and  minimum  points  on  t h e  boundary  squa re  R  can only  occur

minimum  points:  (2,O)  and   (0 ,2 ) .  
c)  We  have  f,,  = 0,  f,,  = 1 ,   f y y = 0  for  all  x  and  y ;  therefore  A C - B2 = -1  < 0 ,  SO 
( 1 , l )  is  a  saddle point,  by  t h e  2nd-derivative  criterion. 

2 H - 5   Since  f  (x , y)  is  linear,  i t   will  no t   have  critical  points:  namely,  for  all  x  and   y  we 
have  f,  = 1 ,   f y   = &.  Therefore  any  maxima  or  minima  must  occur  on   t h e   bounda ry  
circle. 

We  parametrize  t h e   circle  by  x  = co s e ,   y  = s i n e ;   restricted  t o   th is   bounda ry   circle, 
f (x , y)  becomes  a  function  of  0 alone which we  call  g(0):

T h e  region  R  is  a  triangle, on whose  sides  f  (x, y)  takes respectively  t h e  values

I t  follows  t h a t   t h e   critical  point  is  just  a  saddle point;  t o  get  t h e   maximum  to t a l   a rea   4 ,  
make x = y = 0,  z = 4, or x = y = 2,  z = 0, either of  which  gives a  point  "rectangle"  and  a

gives  a  "rectangle"  of  length 4 with  zero  a rea ,  and  a  point  square. 
b)  We  have  f,,  = 5 ,   f,,  = i ,  f,,  = 3 for all x  and  y ;  therefore  A C  - B2 = -2  < 0, SO 
( 1 , l )  is  a  saddle point,  by  th e  2nd-derivative  criterion.

On  t h e  four sides  of  t h e  boundary  rectangle  R ,  t h e  function  f  (x ,  y)  becomes:

By one-variable  calculus, f  (x, y)  is increasing on t h e  bo t tom   and decresing  on t h e  right side; 
on  t h e   left  side  i t   has   a  minimum  a t   (0, O),  a n d  on  t h e  top   a  minimum  a t   ( z ,  2).  Thu s   t h e

At  t h e  critical  point  f  ( 1 , l )  = -1;  comparing with  t h e  above,  i t   is  a  minimum; therefore, 
maximum  point  of  f  (x, y)  on  R :   (2, -1) 
minimum  point  of  f  (x ,  y )   on  R :   ( 1 , l )  
f,,  = 2 for  all x  and  y ;  therefore  A C  - B2 = 4 > 0 and

To  solve  these  symmetrically,  multiply  t h e   left  sides  respectively  by  x ,   y ,   and   z  t o  make 
them   equal; th is   gives 

Xx  = 2Xy  = 3Xz,  or 

x  = 2y  = 32 = 6 ,   since t h e  sum  is  18.

We  get  therefore  as  t h e   answer  x  = 6,  y  = 3,  z  = 2.  Th is   is  a  maximum  point,  since  if 
P lies  on  t h e  triangular  boundary  of  t h e  region  in  t h e  first  oc tan t   over  which  i t   varies,  t h e  
volume  of  t h e  box  is zero. 
b)  Here  f  = c  is  x2  + 2y2 + 4z2 = 12;  equating  components,  t h e   Lagrange  equations 
become 
x2 + 2y2 + 4z2  = 12. 
To  solve  these  symmetrically, multiply  t h e   left  sides  respectively  by  x ,   y ,   and   z  t o  make 
them  equal; this  gives 

yz = A. 22,  x z  = A  . 4 y ,   xy  = A. 82; 

A .  2x2 = A. 4y2 = A. 8 z 2 ,   or 

x2  = 2y2 = 4z2 = 4,  since  t h e  sum  is  12. 

We  get  therefore  as  th e   answer  x  = 2,  y  = fi, 
z  = 1.  Th is   is  a  maximum  point,  since 
if  P lies  on  t h e   boundary  of  th e   region  in  th e   first  octant  over which  i t   varies  (118  of  th e  
ellipsoid),  t h e  volume of  t h e  box  is zero. 
21-2  Since we  want  t o  minimize  x2 + y 2  + z2 ,  subject  t o  t h e  constraint  x3y2 z= 6&, 
Lagrange multiplier  equations a re  

t h e  

To solve them  symmetrically,  multiply  th e  first  three equations respectively  by  x ,   y,  and  z ,  
then   divide  them  through  respectively  by  3,  2,  and  1; this  makes  t h e   right  sides  equal,  so 
t h a t ,  after  canceling 2 from every  numerator, we  get 

Substituting  into  x3y2 z  = 6&,  we  get  3&z3  . 2 z 2 .  z = 6&,  which  gives as  t h e  answer, 
x = & ,   y = f i ,   z = 1 .  
This  is  clearly  a  minimum,  since  if  P  is  near  one  of  t h e   coordinate  planes,  one  of  th e  
variables  is  close t o  zero  and therefore  one of  t h e  others must  be  large,  since  x3y2 z  = 6&; 
thus  P will  be  far  from  t h e  origin. 

21-3  Referring  t o  t h e  solution  of  2F-2, we  let  x  be  t h e  length  of  t h e  ends, y  t h e   length  of 
th e  sides,  and  z  th e  height,  and  get 
to t a l  area of  cardboard  A = 3xy + 4x2 + 2yz, 
volume  V  = xyz  = 1 .  
Th e  Lagrange multiplier  equations  VA = A. V (xy z ) ;   xyz  = 1,  then   become 

To  solve these  equations  for  x ,  y ,  z ,  A ,   t r e a t   them  symmetrically.  Divide  t h e   first  equation 
through by  yz ,  and   t r e a t   t h e  next  two  equations  analogously, t o  get 

which by  sub t rac t ing  t h e  equations in pairs  leads t o  3 / z  = 4 /y   = 212; setting these all equal 
t o  k ,  we  get  x  = 2 /k ,  y = 4 /k ,  z = 3 / k ,  which shows th e  proportions using  least  cardboard 
a r e x : y : z = 2 : 4 : 3 .  
To find  th e   ac tua l  values of  x ,  y ,   and   z ,  we  set  l / k  = m ;  then   subs t i tu t ing  into  xyz  = 1 
gives  (2m) (4m) (3m) = 1 ,  from which m3  = 1 /24 ,  m  = 112 . 3 l I 3 ,  giving  finally

y + 6z = p  yz,  x + 4z = p  xz ,   4y + 6 2  = p  xy; 
Th e  first  th ree   equations a re  t h e  same in  bo th   cases,  since we  can  se t  p  = 1 / X .   Solving t h e  
first  th ree   equations in   ( a )  symmetrically, we  multiply  t h e   equations through  by  x ,   y,  and  
z  respectively,  which makes  th e  left  sides  equal; since t h e  right  sides  a r e  therefore  equal, we 
get  after  canceling  t h e  A ,  
xy + 6xz = xy  + 4yz = 4yz + 6xz ,   which  implies 

xy = 4yz = 6xz. 

a )   Since t h e  sum of  t h e  three  equal products  is  72, by  hypothesis,  we  get 

from  t h e  first  two  we  get  x  = 4z,  and  from t h e  first  and  th i rd   we  get  y  = 6z ,  which  lead 
t o  t h e  solution  x  = 4,  y = 6,  z  = 1. 

b )   Dividing  xy  = 4yz  = 6xz  by  xyz   leads  after  cross-multiplication  t o   x  = 4z,  y  = 6z; 
since by  hypothesis,  xy z  = 24,  again th is   leads  t o  t h e  solution  x  = 4,  y = 6,  z = 1.

for  bo th   derivatives,  u  and  x  are  the   independent variables,  so we  eliminate dv,  getting

w,,  =  eTt . k 2 ( - s i n k x )   =  - k 2w .  
wt  =  reT t  sin kx  =  r W .  

or  r = - a 2 k 2 .

Therefore, we  must  have  -k2w  = - r w ,  
a2  
However, from  t h e  additional condition  t h a t   w = 0  a t   x = 1, we  must  have 
s i n k  eTt  =  0  ; 
Therefore  s i n k  = 0, and  so k = n r ,  where  n  is  a n  integer. 
To see what  happens  t o  w  as t  -+ m ,  we  note  t h a t   since  I  sin kxl  5 1, 
I w I   =  eT t ls inkx l   5  eTt. 
Now,  if  k # 0, then   r = - a 2 k 2   is  negative  and   eTt -+ 0  as t  -+ m ;  therefore  Iwl  -+ 0. 
Thus   w  will  b e   a  solution  satisfying  th e   given  side  conditions  if  k  = n r ,  where  n  is  a 
non-zero  integer, and  r = - a 2 k 2 .
