V11.  Line Integrals in Space 

1.  Curves in  space. 
In  order  t o  generalize t o  three-space  our earlier work with  line  integrals in  the  plane, we 
begin by  recalling the   relevant  facts  about  parametrized  space curves. 

In  3-space, a  vector  function  of  one variable  is  given  as 

I t   is  called  continuous or  differentiable or  continuously differentiable if  respec- 
tively  x ( t ) ,  y ( t ) ,   and  z ( t )   all  have  the   corresponding  property.  By  placing  the  
vector  so t h a t  i ts  tail is a t  the  origin, i ts  head moves along a curve C  as t  varies. 
This  curve can  be  described  therefore  either  by  its position  vector  function  ( I ) ,  
or  by  the   three  parametric equations 

Th e  curves we  will  deal with  will  be  finite, connected,  and  piecewise smooth; this means 
th a t   they  have  finite  length,  they  consist  of  one piece,  and  they  can  be   subdivided  into  a 
finite number of  smaller pieces, each of  which is given as the position  vector of  a continuously 
differentiable function  (i.e., one whose  derivative is  continuous). 

In  addition,  the   curves  will  be  oriented,  or  directed,  meaning  t h a t   an  
arrow has been  placed on  them t o  indicate which  direction  is  considered t o  
be  the   positive  one.  The   curve  is  called  closed  if  a  point  P moving  on  it 
always  in  the   positive  direction  ultimately  returns  t o   its  s ta r t ing  position, 
as  in  the   accompanying picture. 

Th e  derivative of  r ( t )  is  defined  in  terms  of  components by 

If  the   parameter  t  represents  time,  we  can  think  of  d r l d t   as  the  velocity  vector v. If  we 
let  s  denote  the  arclength  along C ,  measured  from some fixed  s ta r t ing  point  in  the  positive 
the  magnitude  and  direction  of  v a re  given by 
direction, then  in  terms of  s

Here t  is  the  unit  tangent  vector  (pointing in  the positive  direction  on  C  : 

d i r v   =

vl  = 

You  can  see from  the  picture  th a t   t  is  a  unit  vector,  since

2.  Line  integrals  in  space.  Let  F  = M i  + N j + P k  be  a  vector  field  in  space, 
assumed  continuous. 

We  define  t h e   line  integral  of  the  tangential  component  of  F  along  a n  oriented  curve  C 
in  space  in  t h e   same  way  a s  for  t h e  plane.  We  approximate  C  by  a n  inscribed  sequence  of 
t h e  approximating sum, th en   pass  t o  t h e   limit: 
directed  line segments A r k ,  form L F . ~ '
=  k+03lim  x r k . A r k

T h e  line  integral is  calculated just  like t h e  one in  two  dimensions: 

if  C  is  given  by  th e  position  vector  function  r ( t ) ,  
one would write  (6) as 

to  5 t  5  t l   . Using  x ,  y ,  z-components, 

In  particular,  if  t h e  parameter  is  t h e  arclength s, then   (6) becomes  (since  t = d r l d s )  

which  shows t h a t  t h e  line  integral is  t h e  integral along C of  t h e  tangential  component  of  F .  
As  in  two  dimensions, th is   line  integral represents  t h e  work  done by  t h e  field  F carrying a 
unit  point  mass  (or  charge)  along t h e  curve C. 
Example  1.  F ind   t h e  work  done by  t h e  electrostatic force field  F = y i + z j + x k  in 
carrying a  positive  unit  point  charge from  ( 1 , 1 , 1 )  t o   ( 2 , 4 , 8 )  along

3 .   Gradient  fields  and  path-independence. 
T h e  two-dimensional  theory  developed  for line  integrals  in  t h e  plane generalizes  easily t o  
three-space.  For  t h e  p a r t  where  no new  ideas a r e  involved, we  will be  brief,  just  s ta t ing  t h e  
results, and   in  places  sketching t h e  proofs. 

D e f i n i t i o n .   Let  F be  a  continuous vector  field  in a  region D  of  space.  T h e  line  integral 
J:  F  d r   is  called  p a th - ind ep end en t   if,  for  any  two  points  P  and   Q  in  t h e   region  D ,  t h e  
value  of  Jc F . d r   along  a  directed  curve  C  lying  in  D  and   running  from  P  t o   Q  depends 
only  on  t h e  two  endpoints, and  no t   on C. 
An  equivalent  formulation  is  ( th e  proof  of  equivalence  is  t h e  same  a s  before):

D e f i n i t i o n   Let  f (x ,  y ,  z )  be  continuously  differentiable  in  a  region  D .   T h e  vector  field 

F . d r  = 0 for every  closed  curve C  in  D 

is  called  t h e  g r ad i en t   field  of  f  in  D .   Any  field  of  t h e   form  V f  is  called  a  gradient  field.

pa r t icu la r ,   th e  line integral i s  path-independent. 

T h e   proof  is  exactly  t h e   same  as  before  - use  t h e   chain  rule  t o   reduce  i t   t o   t h e   first 
fundamental theorem  of  calculus  for  functions  of  one variable. 

The re  is  also  an  analogue of  t h e  second  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus,  t h e  one where 
we  first  in teg ra te ,  th en   differentiate.

Note  t h a t   since  t h e   integral  is  path-independent,  no  C  need  be  specified  in  (11).  Th e  
theorem  is  proved  in  your  book  for  line  integrals  in  t h e  plane.  T h e  proof  for  line  integrals 
in  space is analogous.

As  in t h e  two-dimensional case,  if  F is  thought  of  as a  force field, th en  t h e  gradient force 
fields  a re   called  conservative  fields,  since  t h e   work  done  going  a round   any  closed  p a t h   is 
zero  (i.e.,  energy is  conserved).  If  F = V f ,  then   f  is t h e  called t h e   (ma thema t ica l )  potential 
function  for F; t h e  physical potential  function  is  defined  t o  b e   -f .  
Example  2.  Let  f (x ,  y ,  z )  = (x + Y')Z . Calculate F = V f ,  and  find 1, F . d r ,  where  C 
i s t h e h e l i x x = c o s t , y = s i n t , z = t , O ~ t ~ 7 r .  
Solution.  By  differentiating,  F = z i  + 2 y z j   + (x  + y 2 )k  .  Th e   curve  C  runs   from 
(1 ,0 ,O )  t o   ( -1 ,0 ,   7r).  Therefore by  ( l o ) ,  

No  direct  calculation  of  t h e   line  integral  is  needed,  notice.
