V9 .   Surface Integrals 

Surface integrals a r e  a na tu ra l   generalization of  line  integrals:  instead  of  integrating over 
a  curve,  we  integrate  over  a  surface  in  3-space.  Such  integrals  a re   impo r t an t   in  any  of  t h e  
subjects  t h a t  deal with  continuous media  (solids, fluids,  gases), as well  a s  sub jec ts  t h a t  deal 
with  force  fields, like electromagnetic  or gravitational  fields. 

Though most  of  ou r  work will be  spent seeing how  surface integrals can be calculated and  
what  they   a re  used  for, we  first  want  t o   indicate briefly  how  they   a r e  defined.  Th e   surface 
integral of  t h e   (continuous)  function  f ( x ,  y, z )  over  t h e  surface S is  denoted  by 

You  can  th ink   of  d S  as  t h e   a r e a  of  an   infinitesimal  piece  of  t h e   surface  S .   To  define  t h e  
integral  ( I ) ,  we  subdivide  th e   surface  S into  small  pieces  having  a r e a   A S i ,   pick  a  point 
(x i ,  yi, zi)  in  t h e  i - th  piece,  and  form  the   Riemann  sum 

As  th e   subdivision  of  S gets  finer  and   finer,  the   corresponding  sums  (2 )   approach  a  limit 
which  does  no t   depend  on  th e   choice of  t h e  points  or  how  th e  surface  was  subdivided.  Th e  
surface integral  (1) is defined t o  be  this limit.  (Th e  surface has  to  be  smooth and  no t  infinite 
in  ex ten t ,   and   th e   subdivisions  have  t o   be  made  reasonably,  otherwise  t h e   limit  may  not 
exist, or  i t  may  not  be  unique.) 

1.  The  surface integral  for  flux. 

Th e   most  impo r tan t   type   of  surface  integral  is  t h e   one  which  calculates  t h e   flux  of  a 
vector  field  across  S .  Earlier, we  calculated  th e  flux of  a  plane  vector  field  F ( x ,  y)  across a 
directed  curve  in  th e  xy-plane.  Wh a t   we  a re  doing now  is  t h e  analog of  th is   in  space. 

We  assume t h a t  S is  oriented:  th is  means  t h a t   S has two sides a n d  one of  th em  has been 
designated  t o  be   th e   positive  side.  At  each  point  of  S the re   a r e  two  unit  normal  vectors, 
pointing  in  opposite directions;  t h e  positively  directed unit  normal vector, denoted  by  n ,  is 
t h e  one  s tand ing  with  its  base  (i.e.,  tail)  on  t h e  positive  side.  If  S is  a  closed  surface,  like 
a  sphere  or  cube - t h a t   is,  a  surface with  no  boundaries,  so  t h a t   i t   completely  encloses  a 
portion  of  3-space - then   by  convention  i t   is  oriented  so t h a t   t h e  ou te r  side is  t h e  positive 
one,  i.e.,  so  t h a t   n  always  points  towards  t h e  outside of  S .  
Let  F ( x ,  y, z )  be  a  continuous vector field  in  space, and  S a n  oriented surface.  We  define

flux  o f   F  through  S  = 

t h e  two integrals  a r e  t h e  same, bu t   th e  second  is w r i t ten  using t h e  common 
and   suggestive  abbreviation  dS  = n d S .  

If  F represents t h e  velocity  field  for  t h e  flow of  an  incompressible  fluid of  density  1 ,  then  
F .n represents  t h e  component  of  th e  velocity  in  th e  positive perpendicular direction t o  th e  
surface,  and  F . n d S  represents  t h e   flow  r a t e   across  t h e  little  infinitesimal piece  of  surface

having  area dS .   Th e  integral in  (3) adds up  these flows  across th e  pieces of  surface,  so t h a t  
we  may  interpret  (3) as  saying 
S  =  net  flow r a t e  across S, 
flux of F through 
(4) 
where  we  count  flow  in  the   direction  of  n  as  positive,  flow  in  the   opposite  direction  as 
negative.  More  generally, if  the   fluid  has  varying  density,  then   the   right  side  of  (4) is  the  
net  mass  t ranspo r t  r a t e  of  fluid  across S (per unit  a rea ,  per  time un i t ) .  

If  F is  a  force field, then  nothing  is physically flowing, and  one just  uses  the   term  "flux" 
t o  denote th e  surface  integral, as in  (3). 

We  now  show how  t o  calculate the  flux integral.  I t  takes a  few  steps, and  is  best  done by 
examples.  Th e  basic  things  a re  finding n  and  dS .   We  will  begin  with  two  surfaces  where 
these  a re  easy  t o  calculate - the   cylinder and  the   sphere.  Then we  will  consider a  general 
surface. 
Example  1.  Find  the   flux  of  F = z i  + x j  + y k  outward  through  th e   portion  of  th e  
cylinder x2  + y 2  = a 2  in  the  first  octant  and  below  th e  plane  z = h. 
S o l u t i o n .   Th e  piece of  cylinder is pictured.  Th e  word  "outward"  suggests 
t h a t   we  orient  the   cylinder  so  t h a t   n  points  outward,  i.e.,  away  from  th e   z- 
axis.  Since by  inspection  n  is  radially  outward  and  horizontal, 
x i  + y j  
(5) 
n  = 
a 
(This is th e  outward normal t o  th e  circle x2  + y 2  = a 2  in th e  xy-plane; n  has 
no z-component  since i t  is horizontal.  We  divide by  a  t o  make i ts  length  1.) 

To  get  d S ,   th e   infinitesimal  element  of  surface  area,  we  use  cylindrical  coordinates  t o  
parametrize  the   cylinder: 

As  the  parameters 8 and z vary, th e  whole cylinder is traced ou t   ; th e  piece we  want  satisfies 
0  5 8  5 ~ / 2 ,0  5 z  5 h  . Th e  natural  way  t o   subdivide th e  cylinder  is  t o  use  little pieces 
of  curved  rectangle like  the   one  shown, bounded  by  two  horizontal  circles and   two  vertical 
lines on  th e  surface.  I t s  area d S  is  th e  product  of  i ts  height  and width: 

Having obtained  n  and  dS ,  the   rest  of  th e  work  is  routine.  We  express  th e   integrand  of 
our  surface integral  (3) in  terms of  z  and  8: 

=  (az  cos 8 + a 2  sin 8 cos 8 )  dz do, 
This last  step is  essential,  since the  dz  and  d8  tell  us  the   surface  integral will  be  calculated 
in  terms of  z  and  8 ,  and  therefore  the   integrand must  use  these  variables  also.  We  can  now 
calculate  the  flux  through  S :  

using  (6).

E x a m p l e   2 .   Find  the  flux  of  F = xz  i + yz j  + z2k  outward  through  t h a t  p a r t   of  the  
sphere x2 + y2 + z 2  = a 2  lying in  th e  first  octant  (x ,  y, z ,  2 0 ) .  
S o l u t i o n .   Once  again,  we  begin  by  finding  n  and  d S   for  the   sphere.  We  take  th e  
outside of  the   sphere as th e  positive  side,  so n  points  radially  outward  from  th e   origin; we 
see by  inspection  therefore  t h a t  

where we  have  divided  by  a  t o  make n  a  unit  vector. 

To do th e  integration,  we  use  spherical  coordinates  p, q5,  8.  On  the   surface of  th e  sphere, 
p  = a ,   so  the   coordinates  a re  just  th e   two  angles  q5  and  8.  Th e   area  element  d S  is  most 
easily  found  using  the  volume  element: 

dV = p2 sin q5 dp dq5 d8 = d S  . dp  =  area  . thickness 

so t h a t   dividing by  th e  thickness  dp and  setting p = a ,  we  get 

(9) 

d S  = a 2  sinq5dq5d8. 

Finally  since the   area  element  d S  is  expressed  in  terms  of  q5  and   8 ,  th e   integration  will 
be  done  using  these  variables, which  means  we  need  t o  express  x ,  y ,  z  in  terms  of  q5  and  8. 
We  use  th e   formulas  expressing  Cartesian  in  terms  of  spherical  coordinates  (setting p = a 
since  (x ,  y ,  z )  is  on  th e  sphere): 

We  can  now  calculate  th e  flux  integral  (3 ) .  By  (8) and  (9 ) ,  th e  integrand  is 

Using  ( l o ) ,  and  noting  t h a t  x2  + y 2  + z2  = a 2 ,  th e  integral becomes

2 .   Flux  through  general  surfaces. 
For  a  general  surface,  we  will  use  xyz-coordinates.  Two  forms  for  t h e   equation  of  t h e  
surface, and   t h e  corresponding form  for  n  are: 

V F
(choose th e   right  sign); 
n = f -

- f z i   - f g j  + k 
n =

f y 2  
(f: 
1 ) l I 2  
T h e  expression (11) for n uses  t h e  fact  t h a t  t h e  gradient  V F  is normal t o  t h e  surface F = c; 
we  divided  by  lVF l   t o  make n a un i t   vector.  To get  t h e  second form  ( l l ' ) ,  write t h e  surface 
in  t h e  form  z - f (x ,  y) = 0 ,  and  th en   use  ( l l ) ,  tak ing  F ( x ,  y, z )  t o  be   z - f ( x ,  y ) .  
As  a n  example of  t h e  use  of  ( l l ) ,  for  t h e  sphere x2  + y 2  + z 2  = a 2 ,  it  gives  immediately 
t h e  un i t   normal vector 
n = - ( x i   + y j  + z k )  .

Most  often  however  i t   is  (11')  t h a t   is  used.  We  will  need  therefore  t h e  
expression  for  d S  in  xy-coordinates.  A  n a tu r a l  choice for  t h e  infinitesimal 
element  of  surface is t h e  infinitesimal piece of  S lying over t h e  a r e a  element 
dx dy  in  t h e  xy-plane.  T h e  a r e a  of  these two pieces a r e  related  by  t h e  basic 
formula

T h e   argument  for  (12)  is  a s   follows.  Since  d S  is  small,  we  can  suppose  t o   a 
first-order  approximation  t h a t   i t   lies  in  a  plane  P .  Then  t h e  formula  (12)  is just 
a  special case of  a  useful  result  relating t h e  a r e a  of  region  R  in  t h e  xy-plane  with 
t h e  a rea  of  t h e  region  R'  lying above i t   in  t h e  plane  P, namely:

a r e a  R'  = - ( n  = unit  normal  t o  P ) .

We  can  see t h a t   (13) is  t ru e   in  two  steps:

normals  n  and   k  . Therefore

which proves  S tep  1 .  

S tep   2:   To  prove  (13) for  general  plane  a reas  R  and   R',  we  subdivide R  into 
small  rectangles  A R   of  t h e   typ e   used  in  S tep   1.  Th is   gives  a  corresponding 
subdivision  of  R'  into  rectangles  AR ' .   (The re  will  be   left-over  pieces,  of  course, 
bu t   their  a r e a  will  be  negligible  if  t h e  subdivision is  fine enough.)

Since  (13)  is  t r u e   for  each  of  t h e   l i t t le   pieces  above  and   below,  i t   is  t r u e   for 
their  corresponding  sums  as  well,  and  these  two  sums approximate  t h e   a rea  of  R 
and   R '   arbitrarily  closely.  Th is   completes  t h e   argument  for  (13 ) ,  and   therefore 
also for  (12). 

If  we  apply  (11') t o   (12), we  get  t h e  explicit  expression 

One can  think  of  th is  as t h e  two-dimensional  analog of  t h e  one-dimensional formula  for  t h e  
infinitesimal arclength  along a  curve y = f  (x ) :  

Actually,  for  calculating  t h e   surface  integral  representing  flux,  what  is  needed  is  not  d S  
alone,  bu t   r a th e r   t h e   combination  n d S .   If  we  combine  (11')  a n d   (129 ,   t h e   square  roots 
miraculously  cancel  each  other  ou t ,   and   we  end  up  with  t h e  much  simpler-looking vector 
formula 

(13) 

dS  =  n d S   =  (- f ,   i  - f ,   j  + k )  dx dy 

(n  points  "up") 

and   this  is  t h e  formula  you  will  use  most  frequently  in  calculating  surface  integrals  for  t h e  
flux  through  a  general  surface  given  by  z  = f  (x ,  y). 
E x a m p l e  3.  T h e  portion  of  t h e  plane  22 - 2y  + z  = 1  lying  in   t h e   first  oc tan t   forms 
a  triangle  S .  Find  t h e  flux  of  F = x i  + y j  + z k  through  S; take   t h e   positive  side  of  S as 
t h e  one where  t h e  normal points  "up". 
S o l u t i o n .   Writing  t h e  plane  in  t h e  form  z  = 1- 22 + 2y, we  get  by  (13), 

where  R  is  t h e   region  in  t h e   xy-plane  over  which  S lies.  (Note  t h a t   since  t h e   integration 
is  t o   be  in  terms  of  x  and   y ,   we  had  t o  express  z  in  terms  of  x  and   y  for  th is   last  step.) 
To  see  what  R  is  explicitly,  t h e   plane  intersects  t h e   th ree   coordinate  axes  respectively  a t  
x  = 112,  y = -112,  z  = 1 . So R  is  t h e  region  pictured; our  integral has  integrand  1, so i ts  
value  is  t h e  a rea  of  R ,  which  is  118. 

R e m a r k .   When  we  write z  = f  (x ,  y ) ,  we  a re  agreeing t o  parametrize  ou r   surface using 
x  and   y  a s   parameters.  Thus   t h e   flux  integral  will  be  reduced  t o   a  double  integral  over 
a  region  R  in  t h e   xy-plane,  involving  only  x  and   y.  Therefore  you  mus t   get  rid  of  z  by 
using  the  relation z  = f  (x ,  y)  after  you  have  calculated  t h e   flux  integral  using  (13).  Th en  
determine R  ( th e  projection  of  S onto t h e  xy-plane), and  supply  t h e   limits  for  t h e  i te ra ted  
integral over R .

Th e  general  surface  integral 

t h a t   we  introduced  a t  t h e  beginning  of  th is   section  can  be  used  for many  th ings  o the r  than  
calculating  flux.  Here  a r e  some examples. 
a )  Surface  area.  We  let  t h e  function  f (x ,  y ,  z )  = 1 . Then   t h e  a r e a  of  S  =  JL ds 
b )  Mass, moments, charge  etc.  If  S is  a  th in   shell  of  ma te r ia l ,  of  uniform  thickness, 
and  with  density  (in gms/unit  a rea )   given  by  6 (x ,  y, z ) ,  then  
mass  of  S  =  J j s  6 (x , l,2) d s ,  
x-component  of  center  of  mass  =  T  = -R x . 6 d s  
mass  S 
with  t h e  y-  and   z-components  of  t h e   center  of  mass  defined  similarly.  If  6 (x ,  y ,  z )   rep- 
resents  a n  electric  charge  density,  then   t h e   surface  integral  on  t h e   left  above  will  give  t h e  
to t a l  charge on  S .  And  so on. 
c )  Average  value.  Th e  average value  of  a  function  f (x ,  y ,  z )   over  t h e  surface S can  be 
calculated  by  a  surface  integral: 
a r e a  S J J s  
average value  of  f  on  s = - f ( x ,  Y ,  z )  d s  . 
I n  evaluating such integrals  a s   (14 ) ,  if  t h e  surface  is a  sphere or  cylinder, th en   d S  should 
be written  down  using t h e  formulas in section 2  of  V9, while if  t h e  surface  is  a more general 
one,  given  by  z  = f (x ,  y),  then   one  uses  t h e  results  of  section  3  ins tead  - unfortunately, 
th e   radical  which  appea rs  in  d S  (see  (12') will  no t   disappear,  since th e r e   is  no   n  t o  cancel 
i t .  

Example  4 .   F ind   t h e   average  distance  along  t h e   e a r t h   of  t h e   points  in  t h e   northern 
hemisphere from  t h e  North  Pole.  (Assume  t h e  e a r th   is  a  sphere of  radius  a . )  

Solution.  - We  use  (15)  and   spherical  coordinates,  choosing  t h e   co- 
ordinates  so  t h e   North  Pole  is  a t   z  = a  on  t h e   z-axis.  T h e   distance  of 
t h e  point  ( a ,  ), 19)  from  ( a ,  0,O) is  a),  measured  along t h e  great  circle, i.e., 
th e  longitude  line - see  t h e  picture).  We  want  t o  find  t h e  average of  th is
