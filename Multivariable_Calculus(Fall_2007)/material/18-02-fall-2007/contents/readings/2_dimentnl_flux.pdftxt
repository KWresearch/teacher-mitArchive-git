V3.  Two-dimensional Flux 

In  this  section  and  th e  next  we  give a  different  way  of  looking a t  Green's  theorem which 
both  shows i ts  significance for flow  fields and allows us  t o  give an  intuitive physical meaning 
for  this  ra the r  mysterious  equality  between integrals. 
We  have  seen th a t   if  F is a  force field  and  C  a  directed  curve, then

work  done  by  F along C  = 

In  words, we  a re   integrating  F . T ,  the   t a n g e n t i a l   c o m p o n e n t   of  F, along  th e   curve  C.  In 
component  notation,  if  F = M i  + N j  , then  th e  above reads 

Analogously  now,  we  may  integrate  F  . n ,   th e   n o r m a l   c o m p o n e n t   of  F  along  C.  To 
describe  this,  suppose  th e   curve  C  is  parametrized  by  th e   arclength  s ,   increasing  in  th e  
positive  direction  on  C.  Th e  position  vector  for  th is  parametrization  and  i t s  corresponding 
tangent  vector  a re  given  respectively by 

where we  have  used  t  instead  of  T since i t   is  a  unit  vector- 
by  dividing  through by  ds  on  both  sides of 
ds  = J ( d x ) ~  + ( d ~ ) ~. 
The  unit  normal  vector  n  is  th e  one  shown  in  th e   picture,  obtained  by  ro ta t ing  t 
clockwise through  a  right  angle. 

its  length  is  1 ,  as  one  can  see 

Unfortunately,  this  direction  is  opposite  t o   th e   one  customarily  used  in  kine- 
matics,  where  t  and  n  form  a  right-handed  coordinate  system  for  motion  along 
C.  Th e  choice of  n  depends  therefore  on  th e   context  of  th e  problem;  th e   choice 
we  have given  is  th e  most  na tu ra l  for  applying Green's theorem  t o  flow problems. 
The  usual  formula for  rotating  a vector  clockwise by  90Â°  (see th e  figure)  shows th a t

The   line  integral  over  C  of  th e  normal  component  F . n  of  th e  vector  field  F is  called  th e  
flux  o f  F  across  C. In   symbols, 
flux of  F across C  =  L ~ . n d s=  L ( M $- N $ )   d s  
In  th e  notation  of  differentials, using  (3) we  write  n d s  = dy i  - dx j  ,  so t h a t

S o l u t i o n s .   a )   Th e   field  is  directed  radially  outward,  so  t h a t   F  a n d   n  have  t h e   same 
direction.  (As  usual,  t h e   circle  is  directed  counterclockwise,  which  means  t h a t   n  points 
outward.)  Therefore,  a t  each point  of  th e  circle, 

Therefore, by  (4 ) ,  we  get

t ion  of  t h e  circle:  x  = co s t ,   y = s i n t   . Using  th is  and   (5) above,

Th e   na tu ra l   physical  in te rp re ta t ion   for  flux  calls  for  thinking  of  F  a s   representing  a 
two-dimensional  flow  field  (see section  V l ) .   Then  t h e   line  integral represents  t h e   rate  with 
respect to  time  a t  which  mass  is  being  transported  across  C .   (We th ink   of  t h e  flow  a s  taking 
place  in  a  shallow  t ank   of  unit  dep th .   T h e  convention  abou t   n  makes  th is   mass-transport 
r a t e  positive  if  t h e  flow  is  from  left  t o  right  a s  you  face  in  t h e  positive  direction on  C ,  and  
negative  in  t h e  o the r   case.) 

d t   =  27-r 

To see th is ,  we  follow t h e  same procedure t h a t  was used t o  interpret  t h e  tangen t ia l  integral 
in  a  force field  a s  work. 

Th e  essential s tep  t o  see is  t h a t   if  F is  a  constant  vector  field  representing a  flow, and  C 
I . . .. 
is  a  directed  line  segment  of  length L ,  then  
mass-transport  r a t e  across C  =  ( F  . n )  L

To  see  th is ,   resolve  t h e   flow  field  into  i t s   components  parallel  t o   C  a n d  
perpendicular  t o  C .   Th e   component  parallel  t o   C  contributes  nothing  t o  
t h e  flow  r a t e   across C ,  while t h e  component  perpendicular  t o  C  is F . n  . 
Another  way  t o   se  (6)  is  illustrated  a t   t h e   right.  Letting  C'  be  as shown,  we  see  by 
conservation  of  mass  t h a t  

mass-transport  r a t e  across C  =  mass-transport  r a t e  across C'

Once we  have  th is ,  we  follow  t h e  same procedure  used  t o  define work  a s  a  line  integral. 
We  divide  up   t h e  curve and  apply  (6) t o  each of  t h e  approximating line  segments, t h e  k-th 
segment  being  of  length  approximately  A s k .  Thus  
mass-transport  r a t e  across k - th   line  segment  z  (Fk  . n k ) A s k  .

Th i s   in te rp re ta t ion   shows  why  we  call  t h e   line  integral  t h e   f i x   of  F  across  C.  Th i s  
terminology  however  is used  even when F no  longer  represents a  two-dimensional  flow  field.
