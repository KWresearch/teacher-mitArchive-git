K .   Kep ler's  Second  Law 

By  studying t h e  Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's d a t a  abou t   t h e  motion  of  t h e  planets, 
Kepler  formulated  th ree  empirical  laws; two of  them   can  be  s t a t ed  a s  follows: 

Second  Law  A  planet  moves  in  a  plane,  and   t h e   radius  vector  (from  t h e   sun   t o   t h e  
planet)  sweeps ou t  equal areas in  equal times. 

First  Law  T h e  planet's o rb i t   in  t h a t  plane  is  a n  ellipse, wi.th  t h e  sun  a t  one focus. 

From  these  laws,  Newton  deduced  t h a t   t h e  force  keeping  t h e  planets  in   their  orbits  had 
magnitude  l / d 2 ,  where  d was  t h e  distance t o  t h e  sun; moreover,  i t  was  directed  toward  t h e  
sun,  or  as was  said,  central,  since t h e  sun was  placed  a t  t h e  origin. 

Using  a  little  vector  analysis  (w i thou t   coordinates),  th is   section  is  devoted  t o   showing 
t h a t   th e  Second Law is  equivalent  to   th e  force  being  central. 

I t   is  harder  t o  show  t h a t   a n  elliptical o rb i t   implies  t h e  magnitude  of  t h e  force 
is of  t h e  form K / d 2 ,  and  vice-versa;  this  uses  vector  analysis  in polar  coordinates 
and  requires  t h e  solution  of  non-linear  differential  equations. 

1.  Differentiation  of products of vectors 
Let  r ( t )  and   s ( t )  be  two  differentiable  vector  functions  in  2- or  3-space.  Th en  

These  rules  a r e  just  like  t h e   product  rule  for  differentiation.  Be  careful  in  t h e   second 
rule  t o   get  t h e   multiplication  order  correct  on  t h e   right,  since  a  x  b  #  b  x  a  in  general. 
Th e  two rules  can be  proved  by  writing  everything ou t   in  te rms  of  i , j , k  components  a n d  
differentiating.  They  can  also be  proved  directly  from  t h e  definition  of  derivative,  without 
resorting t o  components, a s  follows: 

Let  t  increase by A t .   Th en  r increases by A r ,  and  s by  A s ,  and  t h e  corresponding change 
in  r . s  is  given by 

A ( r - s )  =  ( r + A r ) . ( s + A s )   - r . s ,  

so if  we  expand  t h e  right  side ou t  a n d  divide  all  te rms  by  A t ,  we  get 

Now  let  A t  + 0; th en  A s  + 0 since s ( t )  is  continuous, a n d  we  get  t h e  first  equation  in  (1 ) .  
T h e  second  equation  in  (1) is  proved  t h e  same way,  replacing  . by  x  everywhere. 

2.  Kepler's  second  law  and  the  central  force.  To  show  t h a t   t h e   force  being 
central  (i.e.,  directed  toward  th e   sun)  is  equivalent  t o   Kepler's  second  law,  we  need  t o  
t rans la te   t h a t  law  in to  calculus.  "Sweeps ou t   equal areas in  equal times"  means: 

th e  rad ius   vector sweeps ou t   a r e a  a t  a  constant  r a t e

18.02  NOTE S  

Th e  first  thing  therefore  is  t o  obtain  a  mathematical  expression  for  this  rate.  Referring 
t o  th e  picture,  we  see th a t   as the  time increases from  t  t o  t + A t ,  the   corresponding  change 
in  the   a rea  A is  given  approximately by 
1
= 
a rea  of  the   triangle  =  - Ir  x  Arl  ,
AA 
2 
since the  triangle  has  half  th e  area of  the  parallelogram  formed by  r  and  A r ;  thus ,  \ 

and  as A t  + 0,  this becomes 

Using  (2 ) ,  we  can  interpret  Kepler's  second law mathematically.  Since the   area is  swept 
out  a t  a  constant  ra te ,   dA/dt  is  constant, so according t o   (2 ) ,  

(3 )  

Ir  x  vl 

is a  constant. 

Moreover, since Kepler's law  says r  lies  in  a plane, th e  velocity  vector v  also lies in  the  same 
plane, and  therefore 

r  x  v  h a s  constant  direction  (perpendicular  t o  the plane  of motion). 

(4) 
Since the  direction  and magnitude  of  r  x  v  are bo th   constant, 

(5) 

and  from  this  we  see th a t  

r  x  v  =  K ,  a  constant  vector, 

But  according  t o  th e   rule  (1) for  differentiating  a  vector  product, 

d 
- ( r  x  V )   =  v  x  v + r  x  a ,  
dt 
=  r x a ,  

dv
where  a  = -,
dt 
since s x  s = 0  for  any  vector  s. 

Now  (6) and  (7) together  imply 

which  shows  t h a t   the  acceleration  vector  a  is  parallel  to  r ,   but  in  th e   opposite  direction, 
since the  planets  do go  around the   sun, not  shoot  off  t o  infinity. 
Thus  a  is  directed  toward  the   center  (i.e.,  the   sun ) ,  and  since  F  = m a ,   the   force F  is 
also directed toward  the  sun.  (Note th a t   "center"  does not  mean  the  center of  the elliptical 
orbits, but  the mathematical  origin, i.e., th e  tail of  th e  radius vector  r ,  which  we  a re  taking 
t o  be  th e  sun's  position.) 

Th e   reasoning  is  reversible,  so  for  motion  under  any  type   of  central  force,  the   p a th   of 
motion  will  lie in  a plane  and area will be swept out by  the  radius vector  a t  a constant  ra te .
