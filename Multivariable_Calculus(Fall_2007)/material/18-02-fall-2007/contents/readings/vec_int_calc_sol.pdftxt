b)  th e  vector  a t  P has  its head  on  th e  y-axis,  and  is  perpendicular  t o  i t  

6A-4   A  vector  field  F = M i  + N j  + P k  is  parallel  t o  th e  plane  32  - 4y + z  = 2 if  i t   is 
perpendicular  t o  th e   normal  vector  to   th e   plane,  3 i  - 4 j  + k  :  th e   condition  on  M ,  N ,  P 
therefore  is  3 M  - 4 N  + P = 0, or  P = 4N  - 3M .  
Th e  most  general  such field is therefore  F = M i  + N j  + ( 4N  - 3M )  k , where M  and N 
are functions of  x ,  y, z .

6C .   Divergence Theorem 

6C -2   Using  t h e  product  and  chain  rules  for  t h e  first, symmetry  for  t h e  o the rs ,  

adding these  th ree ,  we  get 

div  F = npn-l 

x2  + y2 + z 2  
P 

+  3pn  =  p n ( n + 3 ) .

Therefore,  div  F = 0  #  n  = -3. 
6C-3  Evaluating t h e  /ktriple  integral first, we  have  div  F = 3,  therefore

div  F dV = 3(vol.of D )  = 3 -7ra3  = 27ra3.

To evaluate t h e  double integral over t h e  closed surface S = S1+S2,t h e  respective normal 
vectors  a re :  
x i  + y j  + z k  
n l  =

using  these,  t h e  surface integral for  t h e  flux  through  S is 

(hemisphere  S1 ) ,  

(disc 5'2);

6C-5  T h e  divergence  theorem  says 

which  agrees  with  t h e  triple  integral above. 

Here  div F = 1 ,  so t h a t   t h e  right-hand  integral is just  t h e  volume  of  t h e  
te t rahed ron ,  which  is  i (base) (height) = i ( i )  (1) = i. 

since x2 + y2 + z 2  = P2 = a 2  on  S1,  and  z  = 0  on S 2 .  SO t h e  value  of  t h e  surface integral is 
a ( a r e a  of  S1 )=   a(27ra2) = 27ra3, 
P- 

Here  div  F  = 1 ,  so  t h e   right-hand  integral  is  t h e   volume  of  t h e   solid  cone,  which  has 
height  1 and  base  radius  1; i t s  volume  is  i (base) (height)=  7r/3. 
6C -7a   Evaluating  t h e  triple  integral first, over  t h e  
cylindrical solid D ,  we  have 
/k
div  F = 2x + x  = 3 s ;  
since t h e  solid is  symmetric with  respect  t o  t h e  yz-plane.  (Physically, assuming t h e  density 
is  1 ,  t h e   integral  has  t h e   value  3(mass  of  D ) ,  where  3 is  t h e   x-coordinate  of  t h e   center  of 
mass; th is  must  be  in  t h e  yz  plane  since t h e  solid  is  symmetric with  respect  t o  th is  plane.) 

6C-6  T h e  divergence  theorem  says 

3 x d v  = 0,

/ k ~ . d s = M d i v ~ d v .  

/ k ~ . d ~ = / k d i v ~ d ~ .

 

To  evaluate  t h e   double  integral,  no te   t h a t   F has  no  k -componen t ,   so  the re   is  no  flux 
across  t h e  two  disc-like ends  of  t h e  solid.  To find  t h e  flux  across  t h e  cylindrical  side,

since  t h e  cylinder  has  radius  1 and  equation  x2  + y 2  = 1. Thus

a )   Reorient  t h e  lower  hemisphere  S 2  by  reversing  i t s  normal vector;  call  t h e  reori- 
ented  surface  Sb.  Th en   S = S1+ Sb  is  a  closed  surface,  with  t h e   normal  vector  pointing 
outward everywhere, so by  t h e  divergence  theorem, 

since by  hypothesis  div  F = 0.  T h e  above shows

since reversing  t h e  orientation of  a  surface changes  t h e  sign of  t h e  flux  th rough   i t .  

b )   T h e   same  s ta temen t   holds  if  S1  and   S2 a re   two  oriented  surfaces  having  t h e   same 
boundary  curve, bu t  no t   intersecting  anywhere else, and  oriented  so t h a t  Sl  and  Sb  (i.e., S 2  
with  i ts   orientation  reversed)  together  make  up   a  closed  surface  S with  outward-pointing 
normal. 

6C-10 

If  div  F = 0, then   for  any closed  surface S, we  have by  t h e  divergence  theorem 

Conversely:  /lF . d S  = 0 for  every  closed  surface S  3  div  F = 0. 
For  suppose  the re   were  a  point  Po a t   which  (div  F)O  #  0  - say  (div  F ) o  >  0.  Th en  
by  continuity,  div  F  > 0  in  a  very  small  spherical  ball  D  surrounding  P o ,  so  t h a t   by  t h e  
divergence  theorem  ( S  is  t h e  surface of  t h e  ball  D ) ,  

/ l F . d ~ = / / L d i v F d v

F . d S  = 0 for every  closed  surface S .  
Bu t   th is   contradicts our  hypothesis  t h a t

6D-2  T h e  field  F  is  always  pointed  radially  outward;  if  C  lies  on  a  sphere  centered  a t

Therefore  f (x, y, z)  = x2y + xz  + c. 
f y   = x z ,   f,  = xy,  then  by  inspection,  f (x ,  y ,  z) = xyz + c. 
(iii)  If  f,  = yz ,  

6E-4  Let  F = f  - g.  Since V  is  a  linear  operator,  V F  = V f  - Vg  =  0 
We  now  show:  V F  = 0  + F = c. 
Fix  a point  Po : (xo ,  yo, 20).  Then by  the  Fundamental  Theorem for  line  integrals, 

Therefore  F ( P )  = F ( P o )  for  all P, i.e., F ( x ,  y, z )  = F ( x o ,Y O ,   zO )= C. 

6E-5  F  is  a gradient  field only  if  these  equations  are satisfied: 

N , = P y :   2 x z + a y = b x z + 2 y  

M , = P , :   2 y z = b y z   M y = N x :  z 2 = z 2 .  

Thus th e  conditions  are:  a  = 2,  b  = 2. 

Using these  values of  a  and  b  we  employ Method  2 t o  find  th e  potential  function  f :  

therefore,  f (x ,  y ,  z )  = xyz2 + y2z  + c.

for which  df  = M d x  + Ndy  + P d z ;  t h a t ,  is, for which  f,  = M ,   f y   = N ,   f,  = P .  
b)  The  given differential is  exact  if  the  following equations a re  satisfied:

My  = N,  :  a x z  + 3y2z2= ax z  + 3y2z2 .  
Solving these, we  find  t h a t   the  differential is  exact  if  a = 6,  b  = 4,  c = 2.

If  n  = -2,  t h e  line  integral becomes

6H-1  Let  F = M i  + N j  + P k .  By  t h e  definition  of  curl F ,  we  have 

If  all t h e  mixed partials exist and  a re  continuous, th en  Pxy= P y x ,  e tc .   and  t h e  right-hand 
side of  t h e  above  equation  is  zero:  div  (curl F )  = 0.

a s  boundary.  Orient  C compatibly  with  S1, then   t h e   curve  C'  obtained  by  reversing  the  
orientation  of  C will  be  oriented  compatibly  with  S2.  Using  Stokes' theorem,

since  th e  integral on  C' is  th e  negative of  t h e  integral on C .  
O r  more  simply,  consider  t h e   limiting  case where  C has  been  sh runk  t o  a  point;  even  a s  
a  po in t ,  i t  can still b e  considered  t o  be  t h e  boundary  of  S .  Since it  has  zero  length, t h e  line 
integral around  i t  is  zero, and  therefore  Stokes' theorem  gives 
JJ,curl F . dS   =  iF . d r   =  0.
