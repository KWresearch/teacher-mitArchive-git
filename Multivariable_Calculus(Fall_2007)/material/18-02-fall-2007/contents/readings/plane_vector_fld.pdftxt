V1.  Plane Vector Fields 

1.  Vector  fields  in  the  plane; gradient  fields. 

We  consider  a  function  of  t h e  type  

where  M  and   N  a r e   bo th   functions  of  two  variables.  To  each  pair  of  values  (xo, yo)  for 
which  bo th   M  and   N  a re   defined,  such  a  function  assigns  a  vector  F ( x o ,  yo) in  t h e  plane. 
F is  therefore  called  a  vector  func t ion   o f  two   variables.  Th e   set  of  points  (x ,  y)  for which 
F is  defined  is  called  t h e   domain of  F .  

To visualize  t h e  function F ( x ,  y ) ,  a t  each point  ( x o ,  yo) in th e  domain we 
place  t h e  corresponding vector F ( x o ,  yo) so t h a t   i t s  tail  is  a t   (xo ,  yo ) .  Thu s  
each  point  of  t h e   domain  is  t h e   tail  end  of  a  vector,  and   what  we  get  is 
called  a vector  field.  Th is  vector field gives a  picture of  t h e  vector  function 
F ( x ,  Y ) .  
Conversely, given a vector field in a  region of  t h e  xy-plane,  it determines a vector function 
of  t h e   type   ( I ) ,  by  expressing  each  vector  of  t h e   field  in  te rms   of  i t s   i  and   j  components. 
Thus   the re   is  no  real  distinction  between  "vector  function"  and   "vector  field".  Mindful  of 
t h e   applications  t o   physics,  in  these  notes  we  will  mostly  use  "vector  field".  We  will  use 
t h e  same symbol F  t o   denote bo th   t h e   field  and   t h e   function,  saying  " the   vector  field  F "  , 
ra the r   th an   "the  vector  field  corresponding  t o  t h e  vector  function  F " .  

We  say  t h e  vector  field  F is  continuous  in  some region  of  t h e  plane  if  bo th   M ( x ,  y)  and  
N ( x ,  y)  a r e  continuous functions  in  t h a t  region.  Th e  intuitive picture of  a  continuous vector 
field is  t h a t   th e  vectors  associated  t o  points  sufficiently near  ( x o ,  yo) should have  direction 
and  magnitude  very  close  t o   t h a t   of  F ( x o ,  yo) - in  o the r   words,  a s  you  move  around  th e  
field,  t h e  vectors  should  change direction  and  magnitude  smoothly, without  sudden jumps 
in  size or  direction. 

In  t h e  same way, we  say F is  differentiable in some region  if  M  and  N  a r e  differentiable, 
t h a t   is,  if  all  t h e  pa r t ia l   derivatives 

exist  in  t h e  region.  We  say F is  continuously  differentiable  in  t h e  region  if  all  these  partial 
derivatives a re  themselves  continuous  there.  In  general,  all t h e  commonly  used  vector  fields 
a r e  continuously  differentiable, except  perhaps  a t   isolated  points,  or  along  certain  curves. 
Bu t  a s  you will  see, these points or  curves affect t h e  properties of  t h e  field  in very  impo r tan t  
ways.

V .   VECTOR   INTEGRAL   CALCULUS 

Where  do  vector  fields arise  in  science  and engineering? 

One impo r tan t   way  is  as gradient  vector  fields.  If 

is  a  differentiable  function of  two  variables, then   i ts   gradient 

is  a  vector  field,  since  bo th   pa r t ia l   derivatives  a r e   functions  of  x  and   y.  We  recall  t h e  
geometric in te rp re ta t ion   of  t h e  gradient: 

(4) 

d i r  V w  =  t h e  direction  u in 

lVwl  =  th is   greatest  value 
I =  V w  . u 
d s   u 
Another  impo r tan t   fact  abou t   t h e   gradient  is  t h a t   if  one  draws  th e   contour  curves  of 
f (x ,  y ) ,  which by  definition  a r e  t h e  curves 

is  t h e  directional  derivative  of  w  in  t h e  direction  u. 

where 

f ( x ,  y)  =  c, 

c cons tan t ,  

then   a t   every  point  ( x o ,  yo ) ,  t h e   gradient  vector  V w  a t   this  point  is  per- 
pendicular  t o  t h e  contour line  passing  th rough   th is  point,  i.e., 

th e  g rad ien t  field o f f   is perpendicular  to   th e  contour curves o f f   . 
(5) 
Example  1 .   Let  w  =  d m  =  T .  Using  th e   definition  (3) of  g rad ien t ,  we  find 
x i  
+ y j  
- 1   + g j  
vw   =  5 .

T 
T h e   domain  of  V w  is  t h e   xy-plane  with  (0,O)  deleted,  and   i t   is  con- 
tinuously  differentiable  in  th is   region.  Since  Ix i + y jl  =  T ,  we  see  t h a t  
IVwl  = 1 .  Thu s   all  t h e   vectors  of  t h e   vector  field  V w  a re   unit  vectors, 
and  they  point  radially  outward  from  t h e  origin.  Th is  makes  sense by  (4 ) ,  
since t h e  definition  of  w  shows t h a t  d w l d s  should be  greatest  in t h e  radially 
outward  direction, and  have  t h e  value  1 in  t h a t   direction. 

Finally,  t h e   contour  curves  for  w  a r e   circles  centered  a t   (0, O),  which  a r e  perpendicular 
t o  t h e  vectors  V w  everywhere, a s   (5) predicts. 

2 .   Force  and  velocity  fields. 

Continuing ou r  search for ways in which vector fields arise, here a r e  two physical s i tua t ions  
which  a r e   described  mathematically  by  vector  fields.  We  shall  refer  to   them   often  in  t h e  
sequel,  using  ou r   physical  intuition  t o   suggest  th e   so r t   of  mathematical  properties  t h a t  
vector  fields ought  t o  have.

Force  fields. 

From physics, we  have  th e  two-dimensional electrostatic force fields arising from  a distri- 
bution  of  s ta t ic   (i.e., not  moving)  charges  in th e  plane.  At  each point  ( x o ,  yo) of  t h e  plane, 
we  pu t   a  vector  representing  the  force which  would  act  on  a  unit  positive  charge  placed  a t  
t h a t  point. 

In th e  same way, we  get vector  fields arising from a distribution of  masses in  th e  xy-plane, 
representing th e  gravitational force acting a t  each point  on a unit  mass.  The re  a r e  also th e  
electromagnetic fields arising from moving electric charges and /o r  a distribution of  magnets, 
representing th e  magnetic  force a t  each point. 

Any  of  these we  shall simply  refer  t o  as  a  force  field. 
Example  2 .   Find  th e   two-dimensional  electrostatic  force  field  F  arising  from  a  unit 
positive  charge placed  a t   th e  origin, given  t h a t   F is  directed  radially  away  from  th e   origin 
and  t h a t   i t   has magnitude  c / r 2 .  
Solution.  Since th e  vector  x i  + y j  with  tail  a t   (x ,  y)  is  directed  radially  outward and  
has magnitude  r ,  i t  has  t h e  right  direction, and  we  need  only change  i ts  magnitude  t o  c / r 2 .  
We  do  this  by  multiplying  i t   by  c / r 3 ,  which  gives 

F low   fields  and   velocity  fields 

A second way  vector  fields arise is as  t h e  s teady -s ta te  flow fields and   velocity fields. 

Imagine  a  fluid  flowing in  a  horizontal  shallow  t ank   of  uniform  d ep th ,  and   assume  t h a t  
th e  flow  pa t te rn   a t  any point  is purely  horizontal  and  not  changing  with  time.  We  will  call 
this  a  two-dimensional  steady-state flow or  for  sho r t ,  simply  a flow.  Th e  fluid  can either be 
compressible  (like a  gas ) ,  or  incompressible  (like water).  We  also  allow  for  th e   possibility 
t h a t   a t   various  points,  fluid  is  beiong  added  t o  or  sub t rac ted   from  t h e  flow;  for  instance, 
someone  could  be  standing  over  t h e   t ank   pouring  in  water  a t   a  certain  point,  or  over  a 
certain  a rea .   We  also  allow  the   density  t o  vary  from  point  t o   point,  as   i t   would  for  a n  
unevenly heated  gas. 

With  such  a  flow  we  can  associate two vector  fields. 
There  is  the  ve loc ity   field  v ( x ,  y)  where  th e  vector  v ( x ,  y)  a t  th e  point  (x ,  y )   represents 
t h e  velocity  vector  of  t h e   flow  a t   t h a t   point  - t h a t   is,  i ts   direction  gives  t h e   direction  of 
flow, and   i ts  magnitude gives  th e   speed  of  t h e  flow. 

Then  the re  is  t h e  flow  field,  defined  by 

where  6(x, y)  gives  th e   density  of  th e   fluid  a t   th e   point  (x ,  y ) ,  in  terms  of  mass  per  unit 
area.  Assuming  i t   is  not  0  a t  a  point  (x ,  y ) ,  we  can  interpret  F ( x ,  y)  as  follows: 

(7) 

dir F  =  direction  of  fluid  flow  a t   (x ,  y ) ;  
{ r a t e   (per unit  length  per  second)  of  mass  t ranspo r t  
across  a  line perpendicular  t o  th e  flow  direction  a t   (x ,  y ) .  
Namely, we  see t h a t   first  by  (6) and  then  by  t h e  picture,

(FIA1 A t   =  6 Ivl A t  A1  =  mass  in AA ,  

from  which  (7) follows by  dividing by  A1 A t  and   le t t ing  A1  and   A t  4 0. 

If  t h e   density  is  a  constant  do, a s   it  would  be  for  a n  incompressible  fluid  a t   a  uniform 
tempe ra tu re ,   then   t h e   flow  field  and  velocity  field  a r e   essentially  t h e   same,  by  (6) - t h e  
vectors of  one  a r e  just  a  constant  scalar multiple  of  t h e  vectors of  t h e  o the r .  

Example  3 .   Describe  and   interpret  F  =  x i  + y j   a s  a  flow  field  and   a  force field. 
x2  + y2 
S o l u t i o n .   As  in  Example  2,  t h e   field  F  is  defined  everywhere  except  (0,O)  and   i t s  
direction  is  radially  outward; now, however, i ts  magnitude  is  r / r 2 ,  i.e.,  IF1  = l / r .  

F is  t h e  flow field for a  source of  magnitude  21r  a t  t h e  origin.  To  see th is ,  look  a t  a  circle 
of  radius a  centered a t  t h e  origin.  At  each point  P on th is  circle,  t h e  flow is radially  outward 
and  by  (71,

mass  t ranspo r t   r a t e  a t  P  =  -, 
a

mass  t ranspo r t   r a t e  across  circle  =  - .27ra  =  27r  . 
a 

so  t h a t  

This shows t h a t  in one second,  27r  mass flows ou t   through  every circle centered  a t  t h e  origin. 
This  is  t h e  flow  field  for  a  source  of  magnitude  27r  a t   t h e  origin - for  example, one  could 
imagine  a  narrow  pipe  placed  over  t h e  t ank ,   introducting  21r  mass  units  per  second  a t   t h e  
point  (0,O). 
We  know  t h a t   IF1  =  6 I v I
  =  l / r .  Two  impo r tan t   cases  a re :  
if  t h e  fluid  is  incompressible,  like water, then   i ts  density is  cons tan t ,  so  t h e  flow speed 
must  decrease like  l / r  - t h e  flow  outward gets slower  t h e  fu r the r  you  a r e  from  t h e  origin; 

if  i t   is  compressible  like a  gas, and  i t s  flow  speed s tays  cons tan t ,  th en   t h e  density must 
decrease like  l / r .  

We  now  interpret  t h e  same field  a s  a  force field. 

Suppose we  th ink  of  t h e  z-axis in space as a  long s t ra igh t  wire, bearing  a uniform  positive 
electrostatic charge.  This gives us  a vector  field in  space, representing  t h e  electrostatic force 
field. 

Since one p a r t   of  t h e  wire looks just  like any other p a r t ,  radial symmetry shows first  t h a t  
th e   vectors  in  t h e   force  field  have  0  as  their  k -componen t ,   i.e.,  they   a r e  pointed  radially 
outward  from  th e   wire,  and   second  t h a t   their  magnitude  depends  only  on   their  distance  r 
from  t h e  wire.  I t   can  be  shown  in  fact  t h a t   t h e   resulting  force  field  is  F ,  up  t o  a  constant 
factor. 

Such a  field  is called  "two-dimensional",  even though  i t   is a vector  field  in space, because 
z  and   k  don't  enter  into i t s  description - once you know how  i t  looks  in  t h e  xy-plane, you 
know  how  i t   looks  all  through  space. 

T h e   impo r tan t   th ing   t o   notice  is  t h a t   t h e   magnitude  of  t h e   force  field  in  t h e   xy-plane 
decreases  like  l / r ,   not like  l / r 2 ,  a s  i t  would  if  t h e  charge were  all  a t  a  point. 

In   t h e   same  way,  t h e  gravitational  field  of  a  uniform  mass  distribution  along  t h e   z-axis 
would  be  -F,  up  t o  a  constant  factor, and  would  be called a  "two-dimensional  gravitational 
field".  Naturally,  we  don't have  infinite long straight  wires,  bu t   if  you  have  a  long  straight

wire,  and   s tay   away  from  i t s   ends ,  o r   have only  a  sho r t   s t ra igh t   wire,  bu t   s tay   close  t o  i t ,  
t h e  force  field  will  look  like F near  t h e  wire. 
Example  4.  F ind   t h e  velocity  field of  a  fluid with  density  1 in  a  shallow  t ank ,  ro t a t ing  
with  cons tan t   angular  velocity  w counterclockwise around  t h e  origin. 
Solution.  F i rs t   we  find  t h e  field  direction  a t  each  point  (x , y ) .  
We  know  t h e  vector  x i   + y j is  directed  radially  ou twa rd .   Therefore  a 
vector  perpendicular  t o   i t   in  t h e   counterclockwise  direction  (see  picture) 
will  be  -y  i  + x j (since i t s  scalar p roduc t   with  x i  + y j is  0  and   t h e  signs 
a r e  co r rec t ) .  

I  R 

T h e   preceding  vector  has   magn i tude   r .   If  t h e   angu la r   velocity  is  w,  th en   t h e   linear 
velocity  is  given  by 

IvI  =  WT, 

so t o  get  t h e  velocity  field,  we  should multiply  t h e  above field  by  w  :
