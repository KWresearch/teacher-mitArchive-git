V7.  Laplace's Equa t ion  
and  Harmon ic  Funct ions  

In  th is   section, we  will  show how  Green's theorem  is  closely connected  with  solutions  t o  
Laplace's pa r t ia l   differential  equation in  two  dimensions: 

where w (x ,  y)  is some unknown  function of  two variables, assumed t o  be twice  differentiable. 
Equation  (1) models  a  variety  of  physical  situations,  a s  we  discussed  in  Section  P  of  these 
notes, and  shall briefly  review. 

1.  The Laplace  operator  and  harmonic  functions. 
Th e   two-dimensional  Laplace  op e r a to r ,   or  laplacian  as  i t   is  often  called,  is  denoted  by 
V2  or  lap,  and  defined  by 

Th e  notation  V 2  comes  from  thinking of  t h e  operator  a s  a  so r t  of  symbolic scalar product: 

In  te rms   of  th is   ope ra to r ,  Laplace's  equation  (1) reads  simply 

(3) 

Notice  t h a t   t h e  laplacian  is  a  linear  ope ra to r ,  t h a t   is  i t   satisfies  t h e  two  rules 
v 2 ( u+ v)  =  v 2 u  + v 2 v  , 
v2(cu)  =  c ( v 2 u ) ,  
for  any  two  twice  differentiable functions  u ( x ,  y)  and  v (x ,  y)  and   any  constant  c. 
Definition.  A  function  w (x ,  y )  which  has  continuous  second  pa r t ia l   derivatives  and  
solves Laplace's  equation  (1)  is  called  a  harmonic  function. 

In   t h e   sequel,  we  will  use  t h e   Greek  le t te rs   q5  and   $  t o   denote  harmonic  functions; 
functions which  a ren ' t  assumed  t o  be  harmonic will be  denoted by  Roman  le t te rs  f ,g ,  u ,  v, 
etc..  According  t o  t h e  definition, 
4 ( x ,  y)  is  harmonic  H  v2q5 =  0  .

By  combining  (4)  with  t h e  rules  (3) for  using  Laplace ope ra to r ,  we  see

A .   Harmonic homogeneous polynomials1 in two  variables. 
Degree  0:  all constants  c a r e  harmonic. 
Degree  1: all  linear  polynomials a x  + by  a r e  harmonic.

(Check  th is   against  t h e  above when  n = 2.) 
B .   Functions with radial symmetry.  Letting  r = d m , t h e  function  given by 
$ ( r )   =  In r  is  harmonic, and  i t s  constant multiples  c l n r  a r e  t h e  only  harmonic  functions 
with  radial  symmetry, i.e.,  of  t h e  form  f ( r ) .  
C.  Exponentially  growing  or  decaying  oscillations.

For  all  k  t h e   functions 

a r e  harmonic. 

In  general, harmonic  functions  cannot  be  written  down  explicitly in  te rms   of  elementary 
functions.  Nevertheless,  we  will  b e   able  t o   prove  things  abou t   th em ,   by  using  Green's 
theorem. 

2 .   Harmonic  functions  and  vector  fields. 
T h e  relation  between  harmonic  functions  and  vector  fields rests  on  t h e  simple identity 
div  Vf  =  v 2 f ,  

(6) 

which  is  easily  verified,  since 

i t s  t r u t h   is  suggested  symbolically  by 

The re   is  a n   impo r tan t   connection  between  harmonic  functions  a n d   conservative  fields 
which  follows immediately  from  (6): 

(7) 

Le t  F  =  V f .   Then  div F = 0 

f  is harmonic. 

Another  way  t o  pu t   th is   is  t o  say:  in  a  simply-connected region, 

(7') 

curl F = 0  a n d   div F = 0 

F = Vq5.  where  q5  is harmonic. 

This  is just  (7 ) ,  combined  with  t h e  criterion  for  gradient  fields  (Section V5, X ) .  

In other words, from t h e  vector field viewpoint, t h e  theory of harmonic functions 
and  Laplace's equation is t h e  same a s  t h e  theory of  conservative vector  fields with 
zero  divergence.  Where  do  such  functions  and   fields occur? 

'A   homogeneous polynomial in  several variables is one in which all  the terms have the same total  degree, 
like  x 2 y  + 2y3  or  x 5  - 6 xZ y 3+ 4 x y 4 .  

V7.  LAPLACE'S   EQUATION   AND  HARMON IC   FUNCT IONS  

One place  is  in  hea t   flow  problems.  Imagine  a  th in   uniform me ta l   p la te  which 
is  insulated  on t h e  faces so no  hea t   can enter  or  escape on  t h e  faces, and  imagine 
t h a t   some  tempe ra tu re   distribution  is  maintained  along  t h e   edge  of  t h e   plate. 
Then   when  t h e   tempe ra tu re   distribution  on  t h e   p la te   has   reached  s teady -s ta te ,  
i t   will  be  given  by  a  harmonic  function  $ (x ,  y ) ;   namely,  i t   must  satisfy  t h e   hea t  
equation  (see Section P of  these notes):  q5,,  + $,,  =  a 2 g t ,   bu t   gt = 0 since t h e  
tempe ra tu re   is  not  changing with  time,  by  assumption. 

Harmonic  functions  also  occur  as  th e   potential  functions  for  two-dimensional 
gravitational,  electrostatic, and   electromagnetic  fields,  in   regions  of  space which 
(Here,  "two- 
a r e   respectively  free  of  mass,  s ta t ic   charge,  or  moving  charges. 
dimensional"  means  not  t h a t   t h e   fields  lie  in   t h e   xy-plane,  bu t   ra the r   t h a t   a s  
fields in three-space,  t h e  vectors all lie in horizontal  planes,  a n d  t h e  field  looks  t h e  
same no  m a t t e r   wha t   horizontal  plane  i t   is  viewed  in.  A  typical  example would 
be  t h e  field  arising from  a  uniform  mass or  charge distribution  on a  set of  vertical 
wires,  or  from uniform  currents  on vertical  wires.) 

3 .   Boundary-value  problems. 
As  t h e  example  given  above of  a  tempe ra tu re   distribution  on   a  uniform  insulated  metal 
p la te  suggests, t h e  typical problem in solving Laplace's equation would be t o  find a harmonic 
function satisfying given boundary  conditions. 

T h a t   is, we  a r e  given  a  region  R  of  t h e  xy-plane,  bounded  by  a  simple  closed  curve  C .  
T h e  problem  is  t o  find  a  function  g ( x ,  y)  which  is  defined  and   harmonic  on  R ,  and  which 
takes on  prescribed  boundary  values  along  th e  curve  C .  

T h e  boundary  values  a r e  commonly  given in  one of  two ways: 

(i)  a s  t h e  values of  q5  along  C ;  

84
(ii) as t h e  values  of  t h e  normal  derivative - of  q5  along  C .  
drl 
derivative is just  t h e  directional derivative in  t h e  direction 
To explain th is  las t ,  t h e  normal 
I n
of  t h e   (outward-pointing) unit  normal  vector  n :  
84  =  2 =  g . n 
-
drl 
T h e   tangential  derivative  is  defined  similarly, using  t h e  unit  tangen t   vector  t  instead  of  n .  

(no rma l  derivative) 

For  heat  flow  problems,  boundary  values  of  th e  first  type   (i)  would  be most  common -
you  a r e  maintaining a  definite tempe ra tu re   distribution  q5  along  C  and  want  t o  know wha t  
t h e  tempe ra tu re  will  look  like in R .  
For  conservative force  field  problems, with  F = Vq5,  one could  also  get  bounda ry   values 
of  th e   second  type   (ii).  For  example,  if  you  were  given  t h e   field  vector  F  a t   each  point  of 
C ,  th en   you  would  know  Vq5. n  and   Vq5. t  - t h e   normal  derivative  and   t h e   tangential 
derivative - a t  each  point  of  C .   Knowing  t h e   tangential  derivative  however  is  equivalent 
t o  knowing  g5  itself  on  C ,  for 

d s  
and  therefore  $(s)  can be obtained by  integrating th e  tangential  derivative.  So, t o  prescribe 
F  on   t h e   boundary  is  equivalent  t o   prescribing  bo th   (i)  a n d   (ii)  above  for  i t s   potential 
function.

Th e  basic  problems  a r e  now  these: 
A.  Existence.  Does  the re   exist  a  $ (x ,  y)  harmonic  in  some  region  containing  C  and  
i ts   interior R ,  and  taking  on  t h e  prescribed  boundary  values? 
B .   Uniqueness.  If  i t   exists, is  the re   only  one such  4 ( x ,  y )?  
C.  Solving. 
If  the re   is  a  unique  $ (x ,  y ) ,   determine  i t   by  some  explicit  formula,  or 
approximate i t  by  some numerical me thod .  

We  shall now  show how  Green's theorem  sheds some light  on bo th   t h e  existence  and   t h e  
uniqueness  questions. 

4.  Existence  and  uniqueness  for  harmonic  functions. 

In  general, if  t h e  curve C  is  reasonable  (sufficiently smoo th ,  of  finite  length,  and  no t   too  
wiggly),  t h e  values  of  4 on  th e  boundary  can b e  prescribed  more  or  less  a rb i t ra r i ly   as  long 
as they   form  a  twice  differentiable  function  on  C .   I t  can th en  be  proved  t h a t   t h e  harmonic 
function  4  taking  on  those  boundary  values  will  exist  in  t h e  interior of  C .  
Th is   is  no t   so  however  for  t h e   second  type   of  boundary  condition,  which  cannot  be  
prescribed  arbitrarily, as t h e  following theorem shows; i t s  proof  uses  Green's theorem  in  t h e  
normal  (flux)  form. 
Theorem 1.  If 4 exists a n d  i s  harmonic everywhere inside  th e  closed curve C  bounding 
the  region  R ,   then 

Proof.  We  use  (8), then   Green's theorem  in  t h e  normal  form: 

t h e  double  integral is  zero since 4 is harmonic  (cf.  (7)). 
One  can  th ink   of  t h e   theorem  a s   a  "non-existence"  theorem,  since  i t   gives 
condition  under  which  no  harmonic  4  can  exist.  For  example,  if  C  is  t h e   unit 
circle, and  t h e  normal  derivative  is  prescribed  t o  be   1 everywhere on   C ,  then   no  
harmonic  4 can exist  satisfying th is   condition,  since t h e  integral  in  (10) will  have 
t h e  value  27r,  not  0. 

As  far  as  uniqueness goes,  physical  considerations  suggest  t h a t   if  a  harmonic  function 
exists  in  R  having  given  values  on  t h e  boundary  curve  C ,  i t   should  be   unique.  Namely,  if 
t h e  given tempe ra tu re  distribution  is maintained on C ,  then   t h e  corresponding tempe ra tu re  
distribution  inside will  approach a  unique  s teady -s ta te  a s  t -+oo. 

Th is   argument  however  assumes  t h a t   ou r  model  of  hea t   flow  is  complete,  i.e., 
t h a t  Laplace's equation is all t h a t  determines t h e  hea t   flow.  Bu t  maybe  the re  a r e  
some o the r  conditions we  don't know  abou t  and  i t  is  these t h a t   make t h e  solution 
unique. 

We  will  prove  th e   uniqueness  of  4  by  a  purely  mathematical  a rgumen t .   I t   depends  on 
t h e  following theorem.

Theorem 2 .   Green's first  identity.  If  $ i s  harmonic in   a  region  containing R ,  a n d  
f (x,y )   is  continuously differentiable in  R ,   then 

Proof.  As  before,  we  use  first  ( B ) ,   then   Green's theorem  in  normal form: 

div  (f V 4 )   =  ( f $ x ) x   + (f $,), 
=  V f  . V$, 

=  fX $ ,   + f,$,  + f ($,,  + $,,) 
since $,, + $,,
=  0  . 

Subs t i tu t ing  th is   in to  t h e  double  integral in   (12)  gives us  (11). 

T h e  essential step in proving t h e  uniquess  of  4 is t o  prove it when t h e  prescribed boundary 
values  a r e  0.  We  consider  bo th   types  of  boundary  values. 

Theorem 3 .   Let  $ be harmonic in  a  region  containing R .   Then

(c  i s  a cons tan t ) .

Proof.  We  use  Green's first  identity  ( l l ) ,tak ing  f  = 4.  Th is  gives 

+  Iv$I2 =  0  everywhere in R ,  

since  i t   is  continuous  and   2 0 everywhere, being  a  square; 

+ V$  =  0 
in R ,   since  i ts  magnitude  is  0; 
+ 4,  = 0  and   4,  = 0  in R ,  
+ $  =  c  i n R .  

Th is   proves  (14);  i t   also  proves  (13)' for  in  this  case we  know  t h a t   since  $ = 0  on  t h e  
boundary  C ,  t h e  constant  c must  be   0.
