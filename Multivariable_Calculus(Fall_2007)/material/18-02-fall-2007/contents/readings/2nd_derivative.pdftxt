SD.  Second Derivative Test 

1.  The  Second Derivative Test 

We  begin  by  recalling  th e  situation for twice differentiable functions  f ( x )  of  one variable. 
To  find  their  local  (or  "relative")  maxima  and  minima, we 
1.  find  th e  critical points,  i.e.,  th e  solutions  of  f l ( x )  = 0; 
2.  apply  the   second derivative test  t o  each critical point  xo: 
f1 I (xo )> 0  + xo  is  a local minimum point; 
f I1 (xo )< 0  + xo  is  a  local maximum  point. 
Th e   idea  behind  i t   is:  a t   xo  th e   slope  f l ( x o )  = 0;  if  f l1 (xo )  > 0,  then   f l ( x )  is  strictly 
increasing  for  x  near  xo,  so  t h a t   th e   slope  is  negative  t o   the   left  of  xo  and   positive  t o  th e  
right,  which  shows  t h a t   xo  is  a  minimum  point.  Th e  reasoning  for  th e  maximum  point  is 
similar. 
If  f l1 (xo )= 0, th e  tes t  fails and one has t o  investigate fu r the r ,  by  taking more derivatives, 
or  getting more information abou t   th e  graph.  Besides being  a maximum  or minimum,  such 
a  point  could  also be  a horizontal  point  of  inflection. 

Th e   analogous  tes t   for  maxima  and  minima  of  functions  of  two  variables  f ( x ,  y )   is  a 
little more complicated, since the re  are several equations t o  satisfy, several  derivatives t o  b e  
taken in to  account,  and  another  important  geometric possibility  for  a  critical point,  namely 
a  saddle  point.  Th is   is  a  local  minimax  point;  around  such  a  point  the   graph  of  f (x ,  y) 
looks like  th e  central pa r t   of  a  saddle, or  the  region around th e  highest  point  of  a mountain 
pass.  In  th e   neighborhood  of  a  saddle point,  t h e  graph  of  th e  function  lies  bo th   above  and 
below  i ts  horizontal  tangent  plane  a t  th e  point.  (Your  textbook  has  illustrations.) 

Th e   second-derivative  test  for maxima, minima,  and  saddle points  has  two  steps. 

1.  Find  th e   critical points  by  solving th e   simultaneous  equations 

f x ( x ,  Y )   = 0, 
f y ( x , y )  = 0. 
Since  a  critical  point  ( x o ,  yo)  is  a  solution  to   bo th   equations,  bo th   pa r t ia l   derivatives  are 
zero  the re ,  so t h a t   the   tangent  plane  t o  th e  graph of  f ( x ,  y)  is  horizontal. 

2.  To  test  such  a  point  to   see  if  i t   is  a  local maximum  or  minimum  point,  we  calculate 
the  th ree  second derivatives  a t  th e  point  (we use subscript  0 t o  denote evaluation a t   ( xO ,  yo ) ,  
so  for  example  (f ) o   = f (xo ,  yo ) ) ,  and  denote th e  values by  A, B ,  and   C :  

(we  are  assuming  th e   derivatives  exist  and  are  continuous). 

Let  ( x o ,  yo)  be  a  critical po in t   o f f  (x ,  y),  and  A,  B ,  and  C 

Second-derivative test. 
be  a s  in  (1). Then 
A C  - B~ > 0,  A > 0 or C  > 0  +  (xO ,  yo)  is  a minimum po in t ;  
AC  - B~ > 0,  A < 0  or C  < 0  + (30, yo) is a maximum po in t ;  
A C  - B~ < 0  +  ( X O ,  YO )is a  saddle point. 

If  A C  - B 2  = 0, th e   test  fails and  more  investigation  is  needed. 
Note  t h a t   if  AC  - B 2  > 0, then  A C  > 0, so  th a t   A  and  C  must  have  t h e  same sign.

Example  1.  Find  t h e  critical  points  of  w = 12x2+ y 3  - 12xy  and   determine their  type. 
Solution.  We  calculate  t h e  pa r t ia l   derivatives easily: 

To find  t h e  critical points we  solve simultaneously t h e  equations w, = 0 and  w, = 0; we  get 

Thus   the re   a r e  two  critical  points:  (0,O)  and   ( 1 , 2 ) .   To  determine  the i r   type ,   we  use  t h e  
second  derivative tes t :   we  have  AC  - B 2  = 144y - 144, so t h a t  

a t   (O,O), we  have  A C  - B 2  = -144, 
so i t   is  a  saddle point; 
a t   ( 1 , 2 ) ,  we  have  A C  - B 2  = 144 and   A  > 0,  so  i t   is  a  a 
minimum  point. 

A  plot  of  t h e   level  curves  is  given  a t   t h e   right,  which  con- 
firms  t h e   above.  Note  t h a t   t h e   behavior  of  t h e   level  curves 
near  t h e  origin  can be  determined  by  using  t h e   approximation 
w z 12x2  - 12xy; th is   shows  t h e   level  curves  near  (0,O) look 
like  those  of  x ( x  - y ) ,   which  a r e   hyperbolas  with  asymptotes 
x ( x  - y)  = 0,  i.e.,  t h e   y-axis  (x   = 0)  and   t h e   diagonal  line 
(x - y  =O ) .  

2 .   Justification  for  the   Second-derivative Test. 

T h e   t e s t   involves  t h e   quan t i ty   AC  - B 2 .   In  general,  whenever  we  see  t h e   expressions 
B 2  - 4AC  or  B 2  - AC  or  their  negatives, we  should  suspect  t h a t   t h e   quad ra t ic  formula  is 
behind  i t   all,  in  one  of  i ts   s t and a rd  forms  ( th e  second  is  less  familiar, b u t   is  often  used  t o  
get  rid  of  t h e  excess two's): 

Th is   is  wha t   is  happening  here.  We  want  t o   know  whether,  near  a  critical  point  Po,t h e  
graph  of  our  function  w = f (x ,  y)  always  s tays  on  one  side  of  i t s  horizontal  tangen t   plane 
(Po  is th en  a maximum  or minimum po in t ) ,  or whether  i t  lies pa r t ly   above and  pa r t ly  below 
t h e  tangen t  plane  (Po  is then   a  saddle po in t ) .   As  we  will  see, th is   is  determined  by  how  t h e  
graph  of  a  quad ra t ic  function  f (x )  lies with  respect  t o  t h e  x-axis.  Here  is  t h e  basic  lemma. 
Lemma.  For  t h e  quad ra t ic  function  Ax2 + 2Bx  + C ,  
(5)  A C  - B~ > 0,  A > 0 or  C  > 0  j  AX^  + 2Bx  + C  > 0 
for  all x ;  
(6)  A C  - B~ > 0,  A < 0 or  C  < 0  j  AX^  + 2Bx  + C  < 0 
for  all x ;  
Ax2 + 2Bx  + C  > 0 ,   for  some x ;  
Ax2 + 2 B x + C   < 0 ,   for  some x .  

A C - B ~ < O

Proof of  the  Lemma.  To prove  ( 5 ) ,  we  note  t h a t   t h e  quad ra t ic  formula in  t h e  form  (4) 
shows  t h a t   t h e  zeros of  Ax2 + 2Bx  + C  a r e  imaginary, i.e.,  i t  has  no  real  zeros.  Therefore 
i ts   graph  must  lie  entirely  on  one  side  of  t h e   x-axis;  which  side  can  be  determined  from 
either A  or  C ,  since 
A > O   +  lim  A x 2 + 2 B x + ~ = m ;   C > O   + A x 2 + 2 B x + C >   ~ w h e n x = O .  
5-+03 
If  A < 0 or  C  < 0, t h e  reasoning  is  analogous and  proves  (6 ) .  
If  on t h e  other  hand  AC  - B 2  < 0, formula  (4) shows t h e  quad ra t ic  function has  two real 
roo ts ,  so  t h a t  i t s  parabolic graph  crosses  t h e  x-axis  twice,  and  hence  lies  pa r t ly   above  and  
pa r t ly   below  i t .   This proves  (7). 

Proof of  the  Second-derivative Test  in a special case. 
T h e  simplest  function  is  a  linear  function, w  = wo  + a x  + by,  bu t   i t   does  no t   in  general 
have  maximum  or  minimum  points  and   i t s   second  derivatives  a r e   all  zero.  Th e   simplest 
functions  t o  have  interesting  critical  points  a r e  t h e   quad ra t ic  functions, which  we  write  in 
t h e  form  ( t h e  2's will  be  explained momentarily): 
w = wo  + a x  + by  + - (Ax2   + 2Bxy + C y 2 ) .

Such  a  function  has  in  general  a  unique  critical  point,  which  we  will  assume  is  (0,O); th is  
gives t h e  function a special form, which we  can determine by evaluating i t s  pa r t ia l  derivatives 
a t   (0,O):

(w,)o  = a 
(wy)o = b 

w,,  = A 
w,,  = B 
W y y   = C 
(The  nea t   look  of  t h e   above explains  t h e   $  and   2B   in  (8 ) . )   Since  (0,O)  is  a  critical  point, 
(9)  shows t h a t  a  = 0  and   b  = 0, so our  quad ra t ic  function  has  t h e  form 
w - wo  = - (Ax2   + 2Bxy  + C y 2 ) .

We moved wo  t o  t h e  left side since t h e  tangen t  plane  a t   (0,O) is t h e  horizontal  plane w = wo, 
and   we  a r e   interested  in  whether  t h e   g raph   of  t h e   quad ra t ic  function  lies  above  or  below 
th is  t a n g e n t   plane,  i.e., whether  w - wo  > 0 or w - wo  < 0  a t  points  o the r   t h a n   t h e  origin. 
If  (x ,  y)  #  (0, O),  th en   either  x  # 0  or  y  # 0; say  y  # 0.  Th en  we  write  (10) as 

(10) 

We  know  t h a t   y 2   > 0  if  y  #  0;  applying our  previous  lemma  t o  t h e   factor  on   t h e   right  of 
( l l ) ,  (or if  y  = 0, switching t h e  roles  of  x  and  y  in  (11) and   applying t h e   lemma ) ,  we  get 

A C - B 2 > 0 ,   A > O o r C > O  

A C - B 2   > 0 ,   A < O o r C < O  

A C - B ~ < O  

W - W O > O  
f o r a l l ( x , y ) # ( O , O ) ;  
(0,O) is  a  minimum  point; 
f o r a l l   ( x , y )  #  (0,O); 
< O  
W - w o  
(0,O) is  a  maximum  point; 
w - wo  > 0 ,   for  some  ( x , y ) ;
w - wo  < 0,  for  some  ( x , y ) ;  
(0,O) is  a  saddle point.

Argument  for  the   Second-derivative Test  for  a general function. 

This  p a r t   won't  be  rigorous,  only  suggestive, bu t   i t  will  give  th e  right  idea. 

We  consider  a  general function w = f (x ,  y ) ,  and  assume i t  has  a  critical point  a t   (xo, yo), 
and   continuous  second  derivatives  in   t h e   neighborhood  of  t h e   critical  point.  Th en   by  a 
generalization  of  Taylor's  formula  t o   functions  of  several  variables,  t h e   function has   a  best 
quad ra t ic   approximation  a t   th e   critical point.  To  simplify  th e   no ta t ion ,   we  will move  t h e  
critical  point  t o   th e  origin  by  making  th e   change  of  variables 

Th en   t h e   best  quad ra t ic   approximation  is  (if  t h e   x ,  y  on   th e   left  and   u , v   on   t h e   right  is 
upsetting,  just  imagine  u  and  v  replaced  everywhere  by  x - xo  and   y - yo): 

here t h e  coefficients A, B, C a re  given as in  (1) by  th e  second pa r t ia l  derivatives w i th  respect 
t o  u and  v a t   (0, 0 ) ,  or what is th e  same (according to  t h e  chain rule-see 
t h e  footnote below), 
by  t h e  second  pa r t ia l   derivatives w i th  respect  t o  x  and  y  a t   ( x o ,yo ) .  

(Intuitively,  one  can  see  t h e   coefficients  have  these  values  by  differentiating 
bo th   sides  of  (13)  and  pretending  t h e  approximation is  a n  equality.  The re   a re  no 
linear  te rms   in u  and  v  on  th e  right  since  (0,O) is  a  critical  point.) 

Since th e  quad ra t ic  function on  th e  right  of  (13) is th e  best  approximation t o  w = f (x ,  y) 
for  (x ,  y)  close  t o   (xo ,yo ) ,  i t   is  reasonable  t o  suppose  t h a t   their  graphs  are  essentially  t h e  
same  near  (xo ,yo ) ,  so  t h a t   if  th e   quad ra t ic   function  has   a  maximum,  minimum  or  saddle 
point  the re ,   so  will  f (x ,  y ) .   Thus   our  results  for  th e   special  case  of  a  quad ra t ic   function 
having  th e   origin  as  critical  point  ca r ry   over  t o   th e   general  function  f (x ,  y)  a t   a  critical 
point  ( x o ,yo ) ,  if  we  interpret  A,  B,  C a s  t h e  second pa r t ia l   derivatives  a t   (xO ,yo ) .  
Th is  is  what  th e  second  derivative tes t   says. 

Exercises:  Section 2H 

Footnote:  Using  u  = x  - xo  and   v  = y  - yo,  we  can  apply  t h e   chain  rule  for  pa r t ia l  
derivatives, which  tells  us  t h a t   for  all x ,  y  and   th e  corresponding u ,  v,  we  have 

and   similarly, wy = wv. Therefore  a t   th e   corresponding points, 

(w~)(xorYo)= ( ~ U ) ( O , O ) ,  

(WY)(XO>YO)= (wv)(o,o), 

and  differentiating once more  and  using  t h e  same reasoning, 
(w~~)(XO,YO)= (wuu)(o,o), 

(~xY)(xo,yo)= (wuv)(o,o), 

( ~ y Y ) ( x o , y o )= (wvv)(o,o).
