3C.  Applications  of  Double Integration 

If  no   coordinate  system  is  specified  for  use,  you  can  use  either  rectangular  or  polar 
coordinates, whichever is easier.  In  some of  t h e  problems, a  good placement  of  t h e  figure in 
t h e  coordinate system  simplifies t h e  integration  a  lot. 

3C-1  Let R be a right  triangle, with legs bo th  of  length a ,  and  density  1 .   F ind  t h e  following

3C-2  Find  th e   center  of  mass of  t h e  region  inside one arch  of  s i n x ,  if:  a )  6 = 1  b )   6 = y 
3C-3  D  is  a  diameter  of  a  disc of  radius  a ,  and  C is  a  chord  parallel  t o  D  with  distance c 
from  i t .   C divides  t h e  disc  into  two  segments;  let  R  be  th e   smaller  one.  Assuming  6  = 1, 
find  t h e  moment  of  R  abou t   D ,  giving  t h e  answer  in  simplest  form,  a n d  using 
( a )  rectangular  coordinates; 
(b )  polar  coordinates. 

3C-4  Find  t h e  center of  gravity of  a  sector of  a  circular disc of  radius a ,  whose vertex  angle 
is 2 a .   Take 6 = 1 .
