V14.  Some Topological Questions 

We  consider once  again  t h e  criterion for  a  gradient  field.  We  know  t h a t  

and   inquire  abou t   t h e   converse.  I t   is  n a tu r a l  t o  t r y   t o  prove  t h a t  

by  using  Stokes' theorem:  if  curl F = 0 ,  th en   for any  closed  curve C  in  space, 

T h e  difficulty  is  t h a t  we  a r e  given C ,  bu t   not  S .  So we  have  t o  ask: 
Q u e s t i o n .   Let  D  be   a  region  of  space  in  which  F is  continuously  differentiable.  Given 
a  closed  curve  lying  in  D; is  i t   t h e  bounda ry  of  some two-sided  surface S lying  inside D? 

We  explain  t h e   "two-sided"  condition.  Some  surfaces  a r e   only  one-sided:  if  you  s t a r t  
painting  th em ,   you  can   use  only  one  color,  if  you  don't  allow  a b r u p t   color  changes.  An 
example  is  S below,  formed  giving  th ree   half-twists  t o  a  long  s t r ip  of  pape r   before  joining 
t h e  ends  toge the r .  

Surface S 

Boundary C  (trefoil knot) 

S has  only  one side.  Th is  means t h a t  i t  canno t  be  oriented:  th e r e  is no  continuous choice 
for  t h e   normal  vector  n  over  th is   surface.  (If  you  s t a r t   with  a  given  n  a n d   make  i t   vary 
continuously, when  you  r e tu rn   t o  t h e   same  spo t   a f te r   having  gone  all  t h e  way  a round ,  you 
will  end  up  with  - n ,   t h e  oppositely  pointing vector.)  For  such surfaces, i t  makes no sense t o  
speak of  " the  flux th rough  S " ,  because  the re  is no consistent  way of  deciding on t h e  positive 
direction  for  flow  th rough   t h e  surface.  Stokes' theorem  does no t   app ly   t o  such surfaces. 

To  see  what  practical  difficulties  th is   causes,  even  when  t h e   domain  is  all  of  3-space, 
consider  t h e   curve  C  in  t h e   above picture.  I t 's  called  th e   trefoil  kno t .   We  know  i t   is  th e  
bounda ry   of  t h e   one-sided  surface  S, bu t   th is   is  no  good  for  equa t ion   (3 ) ,  which  requires 
t h a t   we  find  a  two-sided  surface which  has   C  for  boundary. 

The re   a r e   such  surfaces;  t r y   t o   find  one.  I t   should  be   smoo th   and   no t   cross 
itself.  If  successful, consider  yourself  a  brown-belt  topologist. 

T h e   preceding  gives  some  ideas  abou t   th e   difficulties  involved  in  finding  a  two-sided 
surface whose  bounda ry   is  a  closed  curve  C  when  t h e  curve is  kno t ted ,   i.e.,  canno t   be   con- 
tinuously  deformed in to  a circle without  crossing itself a t  some point du r ing  t h e  deformation. 
I t   is  by  no means  clear  t h a t   such  a  two-sided  surface exists in  general. 

Th e r e  a r e  two ways  ou t   of  t h e  dilemma.

1. If  we  allow th e  surface t o  cross itself, and  allow i t  to  be not  smooth along 
some  lines,  we  can  easily  find  such  a  two-sided  surface whose  boundary  is  a 
given  closed  curve  C .   Th e  procedure  is  simple.  Pick  some fixed  point  Q  not 
on t h e  curve C ,  and  join  i t  t o  a  point  P on t h e  curve  (see t h e  figure).  Th en  a s  
P moves around  C ,  t h e  line  segment  Q P  traces ou t  a  surface whose boundary 
is C .  I t  will no t  be  smoo th  a t  Q ,  and i t  will cross itself along a  certain number 
of  lines,  bu t   i t ' s  easy  t o  see t h a t   th is   is  a  two-sided  surface.

. (  

T h e  point  now  is  t h a t   Stokes'  theorem  can  still  be  applied t o   such  a  surface:  just  use 
subdivision.  Divide up t h e  surface in to  skinny  "triangles",  each having one vertex a t  Q ,  and  
include  among  t h e  edges  of  these  triangles  t h e  lines where  t h e  surface crosses  itself.  Apply 
Stokes' theorem  t o  each  triangle,  and   add   up  t h e  resulting  equations. 

2.  Though  t h e  above is good enough  for our purposes,  it's an  amazing fact t h a t  for any C 
the re   is  always  a  smoo th  two-sided  surface which  doesn't  cross  itself,  a n d  whose  bounda ry  
is  C .   (This was  first  proved  around  1930 by  van  Kampen.) 

T h e  above  a t  least  answers  our  question  affirmatively  when  D  is all  of  3-space.  Suppose 
however  t h a t   i t   isn't.  If  for  instance  D  is  t h e  exterior  of  t h e   cylinder  x 2  + y 2   = 1 ,  then   i t  
is  intuitively  clear  t h a t   a  circle  C  around  t h e  outside of  th is   cylinder  isn't  t h e  boundary  of 
any  finite  surface  lying  entirely  inside  D .  

A  class of  domains  for which  i t  is  t ru e  however  a re  t h e   s im p l y - c o n n e c t e d   ones. 

Definition.  A domain  D  in  3-space is  simply-connected  if  each closed curve  in  i t   can 
be  sh runk  t o  a  point  without  ever getting outside of  D  during t h e   shrinking. 

For  example,  3-space  itself  is  simply-connected,  as   is  t h e   interior  or  t h e   exterior  of  a 
sphere.  However t h e  interior  of  a torus  ( a  bagel,  for instance) is no t   simply-connected, since 
any  circle  in  i t   going  a round   t h e  hole  cannot  be  shrunk  t o   a  point  while  staying  inside  t h e  
torus. 

If D  is simply-connected,  then  any  closed curve C  is  th e  bounda ry  of  a  two-sided surface 
(which  may  cross  itself)  lying entirely inside  D .   We  can ' t  prove  th is   here,  bu t   i t   gives  us 
t h e  tool we  need  t o  establish t h e  converse t o  t h e  criterion  for  gradient  fields in  3-space. 

Theorem. Let D  be  a simply-connected region  in  3-space,  a n d  suppose  t h a t   th e  vector 
field F  is continuously differentiable  in  D .   Then  in D ,

c u r l F = O  

F = V f .  

Proof.  According t o  t h e  two fundamental theorems of  calculus for line integrals (section 
V11.3), i t   is  enough  t o  prove  t h a t   F . d r   =  0  for  every  closed curve C  lying  in  D .  

Since  D  is  simply-connected,  given  such  a  curve  C ,  we  can  find  a  two-sided  surface  S 
lying  entirely  in  D  and  having  C  a s  i ts  boundary.  Applying  Stokes' theorem,

which  shows t h a t  F is  conservative,  and  hence  t h a t  F is  a  gradient field. 

Summarizing,  we  can  say  t h a t   if  D  is  simply-connected,  t h e   following  s ta temen ts   a r e  
equivalent-if  one is  true,  so  a r e  the  o the r   two:

Concluding remarks  about  Stokes' theorem. 
J u s t   as problems  of  sources  and   sinks lead one  t o  consider  Green's theorem  in  t h e  plane 
for  regions  which  a r e   not  simply-connected,  i t   is  impo r tan t   t o   consider  such  domains  in  
connection with  Stokes'  theorem. 

For  example,  if  we  pu t   a  closed  loop  of  wire  in  space,  t h e   exterior  of  th is   loop - t h e  
region  consisting of  3-space  with  t h e  wire  removed - is  no t   simply-connected.  If  t h e  wire 
carries cu r ren t ,  t h e  resulting  electromagnetic force field F will satisfy curl F = 0 ,  bu t   F will 
no t   be  conservative.  In  pa r t icu la r ,   t h e   value  of  f F  dr  a round   a  closed  p a t h   which  links 
with  t h e   loop  will  no t   in  general  be  zero,  (which  explains  why  you  can  get  power  from  a 
wire  carrying cu r ren t ,  even  though  t h e  curl of  i ts  electromagnetic  field  is  zero). 

As  a n  example,  consider  t h e  vector  field in  3-space 

T h e   domain  of  definition  is  xyz-space,  with  t h e   z-axis  removed  (since  t h e   z-axis  is  where 
T  = 0).  J u s t   as  before,  (Section  V2,p.2), we  can  calculate  t h a t   jc F . dr  = 2n  i f C  is  a 
suitably directed  circle lying  in  a  plane z = zo  and  centered  on  t h e  z-axis. 
Exercise.  By using Stokes' theorem for a surface with more t h a n  one boundary 
curve, show informally  t h a t  for t h e  field above, fc F .dr  = 2n for any closed curve 
C  going  once  a round   t h e   z-axis,  oriented  so  when  t h a t   when  t h e   right  thumb  
points  in  t h e   direction  k ,  t h e   fingers  curl  in  t h e   positive  direction  on   C .   Th en  
show t h a t   if  C  goes a round  n  times,  t h e  value  of  t h e  integral will  be  2nn .

Suppose  now  t h e   wire  is  a  closed  curve  t h a t   is  knotted,  i.e.,  i t   cannot  be  continuously 
deformed  t o  a  circle, without  crossing itself a t  some point  in t h e  deformation.  Let  D  be  t h e  
exterior  of  t h e  wire  loop,  a n d  consider  th e  value  of  jc F . dr  for  a  vector  field F defined  in 
D  and  having curl F = 0 .   If  one closed curve Cl  can be  deformed  into ano the r  closed  curve 
C2  without  leaving  D  (i.e.,  without  crossing  t h e  wire),  then   by  using  Stokes' theorem  for 
surfaces with  two  boundary  curves, we  conclude 

-
More  generally,  two  closed curves Cl  and  C2 a r e  called  homologous, w r i t ten   Cl  C 2 ,  if  Cl 
of  some 
and   Ck  (this  means  C2  with  i ts   direction  reversed)  form  t h e   complete  bounda ry  
surface  lying -entirely  in  D .   Then  by  a n  extended  form of  Stokes' theorem,  (6) will  be  t r u e  
whenever Cl  C2 .  Thus  t h e  problem of  determining  t h e  possible  values for t h e  line integral 
is  reduced  t o   t h e  purely  topological problem  of  finding  a  se t   of  closed  curves  in D ,  no   two 
of  which  a re  homologous,  bu t   such  t h a t   every  o the r   closed  curve  is  homologous  to   one  of 
t h e   curves  in  t h e   se t .   For  any  particular  knot  in  3-space,  such  a  set  can  be  determined 
by  a n  algorithm, bu t   if  one asks for  general  results  relating  t h e   appea rance  of  t h e   knot  to  
t h e   number  of  such  basic  curves  t h a t   will  be  needed,  one  gets  into  unsolved  problems  of 
topology. 

In   ano the r   vein,  t h e   theorems  of  Green,  Stokes,  and   Gauss  (as  t h e   divergence  theorem 
is  often  called)  all  relate  a n  integral over  t h e   interior  of  some closed  curve  or  surface with 
a n   integral  over  i t s   boundary.  The re   is  a  much  more  general  result  - t h e   generalized 
Stokes'  theorem  - which  connects  an   integral  over  a n   n-dimensional  hypersurface  with 
an   integral  taken  over  i ts   n  - 1-dimensional  boundary.  Green's  and   Stokes'  theorems a r e

th e   case  n  = 2  of  th is   result,  while  t h e   divergence  theorem  is  closely  related  t o   t h e   case 
n  = 3 in  3-space.  J u s t   as t h e  theorems  we  have  studied  a re  th e  key  t o  a n  understanding  of
