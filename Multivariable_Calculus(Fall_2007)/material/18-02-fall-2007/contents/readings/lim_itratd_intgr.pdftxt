I .   Limits  i n  I tera ted  Integra ls  

For  most  s tuden ts ,   t h e   trickiest  p a r t   of  evaluating  multiple  integrals  by  i te ra t ion   is  t o  
pu t   in  t h e   limits  of  integration.  Fortunately,  a  fairly  uniform  procedure  is  available which 
works  in  any  coordinate  system.  You  mus t   always  begin  by  sketching  th e  region;  in  what 
follows we'll  assume you've done  this.

1.  Double  integrals  in  rectangular coordinates. 
Let's  illustrate  th is   procedure  on   t h e   first  case  th a t ' s   usually 
taken  up:  double  integrals  in  rectangular  coordinates.  Suppose we 
want  t o  evaluate  over t h e  region  R pictured  t h e  integral 
R =  region  between  x2  + y 2  = 1  and   x + y = 1 ; 

we  a r e  integrating  first with  respect  t o  y.  Th en  t o  pu t   in  t h e  limits, 

1. Hold  x  fixed, and  let y  increase  (since we  a r e  integrating with  respect  t o  y ) .  
As  t h e  point  (x ,  y)  moves, i t   traces  ou t   a  vertical  line. 

2 .   In teg ra te   from  t h e   y-value  where  this  vertical  line  enters  t h e   region  R ,  t o  
t h e  y-value  where  i t  leaves R .  

3.  Th en  let x increase, integrating from t h e  lowest x-value for which t h e  vertical 
line  intersects R ,  t o  t h e  highest  such x-value. 

Carrying  ou t   th is   program  for  t h e   region  R  pictured,  t h e   vertical  line  enters  R  where 
y = 1- x ,  and  leaves where y = d m .
 
T h e  vertical lines which intersect  R  a r e  those between  x = 0 and  
x  = 1. Thu s  we  get  for  t h e  limits: 
JJ, f ( x , Y )  d y d x   =

To calculate t h e  double  integral,  integrating  in  t h e  reverse  order  J& f (x ,  y )  dx dy, 
1. Hold  y fixed,  let  x  increase (since we  a r e  integrating first with  respect  t o  x ) .  
Th is  traces  ou t   a  horizontal  line. 

2 .   In teg ra te  from  th e  x-value  where  t h e  horizontal  line  enters R  t o  t h e  x-value 
where  i t   leaves. 

3.  Choose  t h e  y-limits  t o  include  all of  t h e  horizontal  lines which  intersect R .  

Following th is   prescription  with  our  integral we  get: 
JJ,f ( x ,  Y)  dx dy  = 

x=l-y

2.  Double  integrals  in  polar  coordinates 
Th e  same procedure for  pu t t ing   in  t h e  limits  works  for  these  integrals also.  Suppose we 
want  t o  evaluate over  t h e  same region  R  a s  before 

As  usual, we  in teg ra te  first  with  respect  t o  r .   Therefore, we 
. 1 .   Hold  B  fixed, and  let  r  increase  (since we  a r e  integrating with  respect  t o  r ) .  
As  t h e  point  moves,  i t   traces ou t   a  ray  going ou t  from  t h e  origin. 
2.  In teg ra te   from  t h e   r-value  where  t h e   ray  enters R  t o  t h e   r-value  where  i t  
leaves.  This  gives  t h e   limits on  r .  

3.  In teg ra te  from  t h e  lowest value  of  8  for which  t h e  corresponding  ray  inter- 
sects R  t o  t h e  highest  value  of  8. 
To follow  th is  procedure, we  need  t h e  equation of  t h e  line  in polar  coordinates.  We  have 
Thus  t h e  double i te ra ted  integral in polar coordinates has t h e  limits  p&]

This is  t h e  r  value where t h e  ray  enters t h e  region;  i t   leaves where 
r = 1 .   Th e  rays which  intersect  R  lie between  B  = 0  and   B  = ~ / 2 .

3 .   Triple  integrals  in  rectangular and  cylindrical coordinates. 
You  do  these  t h e   same  way,  basically.  To  supply  limits  for  J&  dz dy dx   over 
t h e  region D ,  we  in teg ra te  first with  respect  t o  z .   Therefore we 

1 .  Hold  x  and  y  fixed, and   let  z  increase.  This  gives us  a  vertical  line. 

2.  In teg ra te  from t h e  z-value where  t h e  vertical  line  enters t h e  region  D  t o  t h e  
z-value  where  i t   leaves D .  

3.  Supply  t h e  remaining  limits  (in either  xy-coordinates  or  polar  coordinates) 
so t h a t   you  include  all  vertical  lines which  intersect  D .   This means  t h a t   you  will 
be  integrating  t h e   remaining  double  integral  over  t h e   region  R  in  t h e   xy-plane 
which  D  projects  onto. 

For  example,  if  D  is  t h e  region  lying  between  t h e  two paraboloids 

.. . . .. . 

z = x  2 + y  2 

z = 4 - x   2  - y 2 ,  

we  get  by  following  steps  1 and  2,

where  R  is  t h e  projection  of  D  onto t h e  xy-plane.  To  finish  t h e  job,  we  have  t o  determine 
wha t   this  projection  is.  From  t h e  picture,  what  we  should  determine  is  t h e   xy-curve  over 
which t h e  two surfaces intersect.  We find  this curve by  eliminating z from t h e  two equations, 
getting 

x2  + y 2   =  4 - x2  - Y 2 ,  
x 2  + Y 2   =  2 .  
Thus   th e   xy-curve  bounding  R  is  t h e   circle  in  t h e   xy-plane  with  center  a t  t h e   origin  and  
radius  fi . 
This makes  it  n a tu r a l  t o  finish  t h e  integral in polar  coordinates.  We  get 

which  implies 

t h e  limits  on  z  will  be  replaced  by  r 2  and  4 - r 2  when  t h e   integration  is  carried ou t .

4.  Spherical coordinates. 
Once aga in ,  we  use  t h e  same  procedure.  To  calculate  t h e  limits  for 
a n  i te ra ted   integral  J&  d p d 4 d 6   over  a  region  D  in  b s p a c e ,   we  a r e  
integrating first with  respect  t o  p.  Therefore we 
1 .   Hold  4  and   6  fixed,  and   let  p  increase.  This  gives  us  a  ray  going  ou t   from 
t h e  origin. 

, 

2 .   In teg ra te  from  t h e  p-value where  t h e  ray  enters D  t o  t h e  p-value where  t h e  
ray  leaves D .   This  gives  t h e  limits  on  p. 
3.  Hold  6 fixed  and  let  4 increase.  Th is  gives a  family of  rays, t h a t   form  a  so r t  
of  fan.  In teg ra te  over  those  &values  for which  t h e  rays  intersect  t h e  region  D .  

4.  Finally, supply  limits on 6 so a s  t o  include all of  t h e  fans which  intersect  t h e  
region  D .  

For  example,  suppose we  s t a r t   with  t h e  circle  in  t h e  yz-plane  of  radius  1 and   center  a t  
( l ,O ) ,  ro t a t e   i t   abou t   t h e   z-axis,  and   take  D  t o  be  t h a t   p a r t   of  t h e  resulting  solid  lying  in 
t h e  first  oc tan t .  

First  of  all,  we  have  t o   determine  t h e   equation  of  t h e   surface  formed 
by  t h e   ro ta ted   circle.  In   t h e   yz-plane,  t h e   two  coordinates  p  and   4  a r e  
indicated.  To see t h e  relation between  them  when  P  is on  t h e  circle, we  see 
t h a t  also angle OAP  = 4 ,  since bo th  t h e  angle 4 and  OAP  a r e  complements 
of  t h e  same angle, AOP .   From  t h e  right  triangle, th is  shows t h e  relation  is 
p = 2 sin 4 .  
As  t h e  circle  is ro ta ted   around  t h e  z-axis,  t h e  relationship  s tays  t h e  same, so p = 2 sin 4 
is  t h e  equation  of  t h e  whole  surface. 
To  determine  t h e   limits  of  integration,  when  4  and   6  a r e   fixed,  t h e   correpsonding  ray 
enters  t h e  region  where p = 0 and   leaves where  p = 2 sin 4 .  
As  4 increases, with  6 fixed,  i t   is  t h e  rays  between  4 = 0  and   4 = r / 2  t h a t   intersect  D ,  
since  we  a r e  only  considering t h e  portion  of  th e  surface  lying  in   t h e   first  o c t an t   (and  thus  
above t h e  xy-plane).

Again,  since we  only  want  t h e   p a r t   in  t h e   first  o c t an t ,   we  only  use  9 values  from  0  t o  
1 ~ 1 2 .So t h e  i te ra ted   integral is
