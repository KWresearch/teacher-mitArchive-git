Lecture 21: Multiclass Classification 
Ryan Rifkin 

Description 
We consider the problem of multiclass classification. We have seen that 
regularization-based approaches (RLSC, SVM) perform very well on 
binary classification tasks, and we hope to extend this benefit to the 
multiclass scenario. We advance the hypothesis that a simple "one-vs-all" 
scheme is an extremely effective approach to multiclass classification. We 
review a number of other approaches, and present experimental 
comparisons.
