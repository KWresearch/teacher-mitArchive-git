Lecture 13: Approximation Theory  
Federico Girosi  

Description 
This class is devoted to the study of the approximation error, and some of 
its general properties. We will present the well known phenomenon of 
"the curse of dimensionality" and show that, when the dimensionality of 
the inputs is high, the numbers of units and samples that are needed to 
guarantee good results are huge, unless we impose some restrictions on the 
class of function to be approximated.
