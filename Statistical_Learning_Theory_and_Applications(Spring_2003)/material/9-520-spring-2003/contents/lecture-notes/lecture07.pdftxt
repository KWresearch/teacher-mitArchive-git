Lecture 07: Stability of Tikhonov 
Regularization 
Alex Rakhlin 

Description 
We briefly review the generalization bounds of last lecture before turning 
to our main goal -- using the stability approach to prove generalization 
bounds for Tikhonov regularization in RKHS. In order to apply the 
bounds, we need to prove that Tikhonov regularization is uniformly stable 
with beta=O(1/l), and also to bound the loss function. In the process, we 
will gain additional insight into the mathematics of optimization and 
RKHS.
