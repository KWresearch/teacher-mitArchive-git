Math Camp 2: Convex Optimization  

Description 
We give a very brief introduction to key concepts in optimization theory 
such as convex sets, convex functions, convex optimization, and Lagrange 
multipliers, and duality. Rather than being at all comprehensive, we try to 
indicate what results will be used in 9.520 and present some intuitions 
about them.
