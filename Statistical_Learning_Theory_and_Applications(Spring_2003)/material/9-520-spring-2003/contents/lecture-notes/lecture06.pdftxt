Lecture 06: Generalization Bounds and 
Intro to Stability  
Alex Rakhlin 

Description 
We introduce the notion of generalization bounds, which allow us to have 
confidence in the functions our algorithms are finding. We introduce the 
notion of algorithmic stability, and explore the connection between 
algorithmic stability and generalization bounds.
