SVM Rules of Thumb  


Description 
We provide some intuition into how to use SVMs. We give advice about 
choosing the regularization parameter C, the kernel and its parameters, and 
the size of the subproblem to solve at each step. Solving machine learning 
probles remains a mix of science and art, but we hopefully provide some 
useful advice and tips.
