Lecture 11: Computer Vision, Object 
Detection 
Bernd Heisele 

Description 
We discuss ongoing research in object detection and computer vision at 
CBCL, with a focus on face detection and recognition. We examine in 
detail the problem of face detection with SVMs, contrasting the use of 
global and component-based classifiers, pixel and wavelet-based 
representations, and real and synthetic training data. We also present a 
real-time SVM-based face recognition system, discussing the technologies 
and challenges involves.
