1.  (a)  The isocline for slope 0 is the pair of straight lines y = ±x. The direction ﬁeld along 
these lines is ﬂat. 
The  isocline  for  slope  2  is  the  hyperbola  on  the  left  and  right  of  the  straight  lines. 
The direction ﬁeld along this hyperbola has slope 2. 
The  isocline  for  slope  -2  is  the  hyperbola  above  and  below  the  straight  lines.  The 
direction ﬁeld along this hyperbola has slope -2. 
(b)  The sketch should have the following features: 
The curve passes through (-2, 0). The slope at (-2, 0) is (−2)2 − (0)2  = 4. 
Going  backward  from  (-2,  0),  the  curve  goes  down  (dy/dx  >  0),  crosses  the  left 
branch of the hyperbola  x2  − y =  2 with slope 2, and gets closer and closer to the 
2
line y =  x but never touches it. 
Going  forward  from  (-2,  0),  the  curve  ﬁrst  goes  up,  crosses  the  left  branch  of  the 
hyperbola x2 − y = 2 with slope 2, and becomes ﬂat when it intersects with y = −x. 
2
Then  the  curve  goes  down  and  stays  between  y  =  −x  and  the  upper  branch  of 
the  hyperbola  x2  − y =  −2,  until  it  becomes  ﬂat  as  it  crosses  y  =  x.  Finally,  the 
2
curve goes up again and stays between y =  x and the right branch of the hyperbola 
x2 − y	 = 2 until it leaves the box.

(c)	  f (100) ≈ 100. 
(d)  It  follows  from  the  picture  in  (b)  that	 f (x)  reaches  a  local  maximum  on  the  line 
y = −x. Therefore  f (a) = −a. 
(e)  Since we know  f (−2) = 0, to estimate  f (−1) with two steps, the step size is 0.5. At 
each step, we calculate
