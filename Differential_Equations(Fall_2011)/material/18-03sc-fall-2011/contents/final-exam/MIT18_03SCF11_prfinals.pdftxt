a) Sketch the direction ﬁeld for this DE, using (light or dotted) 
isoclines for the slopes -1 and 0.

Isoclines:  y �  = − x

(Note problem at (0, 0).) 

b)  For the solution curve passing through the point (1,2):  if Euler ’s method with step-size 
h  =  0.1 was used to approximate  y(1.1), would the approximation come out too high or 
too low? Explain. 
If y(1) = 2 then y � (1) = − 1

2  + 3 1 = 1.
xy � −y
y ��  = −  x2  + 3  ⇒  y �� (1) = 4 > 0  ⇒  concave up 
⇒

c)  Compute the Euler approximation to  y(1.1) using step-size h = 0.1. 
· 
f (1, 2) = 2.1. y(1.1) ≈ 2.1
Euler:  y1  = y0 + h f (x0 , y0 ) = 2 + 0.1 
d)  The  functions  y1  =  x2  and  y2  =  x2  +  1 
x  are  solutions  to  this  DE.  If  y  =  y(x)  is  the 
solution  satisfying  the  IC  y(1) =  1.5,  show  that  100  ≤  y(10)  ≤  100.1.  Do 
we need to
include the equal signs in this inequality? Why or why not? 
The picture at right shows the plots of the 2 given solutions.

The  dotted  line  indicates  that  (by  the  E&U)  the  solution  with  IC  (1,1.5)

must stay between these two solutions.

⇒
y1 (10) < y(10) < y2 (10)

As stated, E&U (= Existence & Uniqueness theorem) shows we don’t need 
the equal signs. 

e)  Find the general solution the DE and verify the prediction of part (b). 
The  easiest  way  to  ﬁnd  the  general  solution  is  to  use  the  2  solutions  given  in  part  (d). 
The equation  is ﬁrst order  linear,  so  the general  solution  to  the homogeneous equation  is 
c(y2 − y1 ) =  c  1 . Thus the general solution is  y =  x2 + c  1 .

a)  Find all critical points and classify each according to its stability type using a phase-line 
diagram. 
p3 − 4 p2 + 4 p =  p( p − 2)2  ⇒  critical points are  p = 0 and  p = 2. 
By looking at the phase line we see that 0 is unstable and 2 is semi-stable.

By hand a rough sketch is fairly easy:  First draw horizontal 
lines  at  p  =  0  and  p  =  2  (the  equilibrium  solutions).  Next 
draw  the solutions above  p  =  2 as curves curving upward, 
those  between  0  and  2  are  ’logistic-like’  going  from  0  to  2 
and  those  below  0  curve  down.  Below  is  a  dﬁeld  plot  of

c)  Explain why the rate information given by the DE was all we needed to get the answer 
to part (b).
