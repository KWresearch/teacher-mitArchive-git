Convolution as a superposition of impulse responses. Modeled on the MIT mathlet
Convolution Accumulation.
In this unit we will learn two new ways to represent certain types of
functions, and these will help us solve linear time invariant (LTI) DE's with
these functions as inputs.
We start with Fourier series, which are a way to write periodic functions as
sums of sinusoids. In Unit Two we learned how to solve a constant coefficient
linear ODE with sinusoidal input. Now using Fourier series and the
superposition principle we will be able to solve these equations with any
periodic input.
Next we will study the Laplace transform. This operation transforms a given
function to a new function in a different independent variable. For example,
the Laplace transform of Æ(t) = cos(3t) is F(s) = s / (s2 + 9). If we think of
Æ(t) as an input signal, then the key fact is that its Laplace transform F(s)
represents the same signal viewed in a different way. The Laplace transform
converts a DE for the function x(t) into an algebraic equation for its Laplace
transform X(s). Then, once we solve for X(s) we can recover x(t).
In the course of this unit, two important ideas will be introduced. The first
is the convolution product of two functions. At first meeting this operation
may seem a bit strange. Nonetheless, as we will see, it arises naturally, and
the Laplace transform will allow us to work easily with it.
The second important idea is the delta function. Up to now all inputs to our
systems have caused small changes in a small amount of time. An impulse is an
input that causes a sudden jump in the system. For example, a sharp blow to a
mass will cause its momentum to jump. The delta function is a mathematical
idealization of an impulse and one which allows us to handle DE's with these
types of inputs.
