***** Course Description *****
The laws of nature are expressed as differential equations. Scientists and
engineers must know how to model the world in terms of differential equations,
and how to solve those equations and interpret the solutions. This course
focuses on the equations and techniques most useful in science and engineering.
*** Course Format ***
===============================================================================
[Click_to_get_started.] This course has been designed for independent study. It
provides everything you will need to understand the concepts covered in the
course. The materials include:
    * Lecture Videos by Professor Arthur Mattuck.
    * Course Notes on every topic.
    * Practice Problems with Solutions.
    * Problem Solving Videos taught by experienced MIT Recitation Instructors.
    * Problem Sets to do on your own with Solutions to check your answers
      against when you're done.
    * A selection of Interactive JavaÂ® Demonstrations called Mathletsto
      illustrate key concepts.
    * A full set of Exams with Solutions, including practice exams to help you
      prepare.
