Cycloaddition Reactions 

Cycloaddition:	 A  pericyclic  reaction  in  which  2  separate  conjugated,  overlapping  arrays  of 
orbitals  combine.  Cycloadditions  proceed  by  way  of  a  cyclic  transition 
state, and 2 sigma bonds are formed during the course of the reaction. 

A suprafacial process ("s" in the table below) is one in which the bonds made or broken lie on 
the same face of the orbital array undergoing reaction. In an antarafacial process ("a"), the 
newly formed or broken bonds lie on opposite faces of the reacting orbital array.
