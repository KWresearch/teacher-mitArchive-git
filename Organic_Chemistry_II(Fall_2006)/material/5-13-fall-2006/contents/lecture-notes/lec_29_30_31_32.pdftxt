Outline & Study Guide for Unit VII. Carbocations 

“Every generation of scientific men (i.e. scientists) starts where the previous 
generation left off; and the most advanced discoveries of one age constitute 
elementary axioms of the next.” 
–Aldous Huxley 

Carbocationic species are  intermediates  in many chemical reactions carried out 
in   the   labora tory ,   as   we l l   as   numerous   reac t ions   tha t   take   p lace   in   na ture .  
Carbocations are so important, in fact, that Professor George A. 
Olah  of The University of Southern California was  awarded  the 
1994   Nobe l   P r ize   in   Chem is t ry   fo r   “h is   con t r ibu t ion   to  
carbocation chemistry.” 
One famous example of a carbocationic cascade reaction 
is   the   b iosyn thes is   o f   cho les te ro l   f rom   squa lene  ox ide. 
Conversion of  the  linear polyene to the four-ring steroid nucleus 
happens   through   a   ser ies   o f   carbocation  rearrangements. 
Elucidation  of  this  extraordinary  biosynthetic  pathway,  one  of  the  most  complex 
known,  was  accomplished  by  Konrad  Bloch,  Feodor  Lynen,  John  Cornforth,  and 
George  Popjak  in  the  late  1950s.   Interestingly,  Bloch  and  Lynen  were  awarded  the 
1994 Nobel Prize  in Physiology  or Medicine  for  their work.   In  the  course  of  the  next 
few  lectures,  you  will  learn  how  you  can  harness  the  power  of  the  carbocation  in  a 
number of useful synthetic transformations.
