Electrocyclic Reactions 

Definition:	

A  pericyclic  reaction  in  which  1  conjugated,  overlapping  array  of  orbitals 
combines.  Electrocyclic  reactions  proceed  by  way  of  a  cyclic  transition 
state, and 1 sigma bond is formed during the course of the reaction. 

Conrotatory:  Orbitals rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) 
Disrotatory:  Orbitals rotate in opposite directions (one clockwise, one counter-clockwise)
