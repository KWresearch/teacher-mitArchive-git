Methods for the Elucidation of the Structure of Organic Compounds 

“…no single tool has had a more dramatic impact upon organic chemistry than infrared 
measurements.  The development, just after the second Great War, of sturdy and simply 
operated machines for the determination of infrared spectra has permitted a degree of 
immediate and continuous analytical and structural control in synthetic organic work 
which was literally unimaginable fifteen years ago…  Physical methods, and the principle 
that they should be used wherever possible, are now part of our armamentarium, and we 
may expect no surcease of further developments in this direction. 

“Nuclear magnetic resonance is even now on the horizon, and we shall be surprised if it 
does not permit another great step forward.” 

R. B. Woodward, 1956 (MIT SB ’36, PhD ’37; Nobel Prize (Chemistry) 1965)

Study Guide 

General Aims of  this Unit: 

1.	

2.	

We will survey  three types of spectroscopy and spectrometry:  Infrared  (IR) 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry  (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) 
spectroscopy (1H and  13C).  For each method, we will discuss  its physical basis, how 
characteristic data are affected by molecular structure, and  the most useful 
applications of these data  in structure elucidation. 

We will apply  the above methods (and others) to  the elucidation of organic molecular 
structures, using a  three-stage strategy:  Determination of molecular formula, 
identification of functional groups, and elucidation of connectivity. 

(Nearly) Foolproof Protocol  for Organic Structure Determination 

A.	 Molecular Formula 
1.	 Determine molecular formula using elemental analysis  (EA) and MS. 
2.	 Determine index of hydrogen deficiency  (IHD = #  rings + # �-bonds)  from 
molecular  formula. 
B.	 Functional Groups 
1.	
Identify  functional groups using  IR and  13C NMR (and  1H NMR occasionally) 
2.	 Determine symmetry  (a.k.a. degeneracy) by comparing  13C NMR  to molecular 
formula. 
C.	 Connectivity 
Identify molecular fragments using data  from  1H NMR: 
1.	
a.	 spin-spin splitting 
b.	
integration 

c.	 chemical shift 

d.	 …and MS fragmentation  (can be done earlier  in elucidation) 

2.	 Assemble  fragments 

3.	 Confirm structural assignment – Must be consistent with ALL data.
