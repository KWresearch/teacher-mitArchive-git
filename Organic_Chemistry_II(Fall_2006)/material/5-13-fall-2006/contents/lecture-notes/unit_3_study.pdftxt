B. Woodward  hit  on  a  puzzle  whose  analysis  become
the point  of  departure  for  the discovery of  the Woodward-Hoffmann  rules concerning  the  role 
of  orbital  symmetry  in  chemical  reactions.  This  development  ushered  in  a  new  era  in  the 
theory of  organic  chemistry,  and  it  is particularly  fitting  that  it was  the protagonist  of modern
natural  product  synthesis  who  triggered  the  final  breakthrough  of  the  use  of  the  quantum
mechanical  model  of  structure  and  reactivity  in  organic  chemistry,  an  advance  that  parallels
the  establishment  of  the  classical  structural  theory,  the  tetrahedral model  of  carbon,  the  octet
rule, and conformational analysis."

"Violations?  There are none.  Nor can violations be expected of so fundamental a principle…"

General Aims of this Unit: 

1.	

2.	

3.	

4.	

We will learn to recognize pericyclic reactions and to classify them as being 
electrocyclic processes, cycloadditions, or sigmatropic rearrangements. 

We will develop a general understanding of the theoretical basis of the Woodward-
Hoffmann Rules based on the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory of Fukui. 

We will learn how to apply the Woodward-Hoffmann Rules to predict the stereochemical 
outcome of pericyclic reactions. 

We will study several pericyclic reactions in detail, learning how to predict the products of 
these reactions and how to employ them in synthesis.  Specifically, we will focus our 
attention on the Diels-Alder reaction, the Cope rearrangement, the Claisen 
rearrangement, and ketene [2+2] cycloadditions.
