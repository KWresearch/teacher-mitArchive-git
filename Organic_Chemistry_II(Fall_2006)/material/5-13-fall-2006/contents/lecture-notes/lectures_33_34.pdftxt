Important Anti-Oxidants 

Free  radicals exist naturally  in our bodies and play  important  roles  in many 
essential  biochemical  processes;  however,  research  has  shown  that  an  excess 
of  free  radicals  can  trigger  destructive  chain  reactions  in  cells.   Free  radical 
oxidation  has  been  linked  to  premature  aging,  high  blood  pressure,  arthritis, 
cancer,  and  many  other  ailments.   No  wonder  Americans  spend  millions  of 
dollars  every  year  on  vitamins  containing  anti-oxidants!   It’s  even  hard  to  buy 
face  cream  that  doesn’t

laboratory.  Methods have been developed  for  the selective  formation of organic 
rad ica ls  under  m i ld  cond it ions,  and  a  great  dea l  of  work  has  focused  on 
understanding and predicting the reactivity of  free radicals once  they are  formed. 
Organic  radicals  have  proven  to  be  synthetically  useful  and  mechanistically 
intriguing.  Over  the  next  few  lectures,  you  will  gain  some  insight  into  the 
incredible potential of free radical intermediates.
