Spin-Spin Coupling for "Vicinal" Protons
The spin of proton Ha influences the energy of the two spin states of 
proton Hb.  This "coupling" is transmitted by the electrons in the bonds 
linking Ha and Hb.  The lowest energy state for proton Hb occurs when 
the spins of the two protons are antiparallel.  Note that this effect does 
not require that the molecule be in an external magnetic field.

Key Features of Spin-Spin Splitting

1.  No coupling occurs among chemically (and magnetically) equivalent atoms.
 
2.  A nucleus coupled to n equivalent nuclei with spin l is split into 2nl + 1 lines.
 
3.  Nuclei coupled to each other have the same coupling constant ("J").
 
4.  The magnitude of the coupling constant J depends on the dihedral angle and 
      type of intervening bonds, but is not affected by the strength of the applied field.
 
5.  "First-order spectra" are obtained only if (va - vb)/Jab > ca. 7 Hz.
 
6.  The splitting pattern for nuclei coupled to two or more nonequivalent atoms 
     can be predicted using "tree diagrams".
