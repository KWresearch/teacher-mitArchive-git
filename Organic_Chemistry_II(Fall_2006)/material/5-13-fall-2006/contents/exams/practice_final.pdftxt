chemically  non-equivalent  (number  of  “different  types”)  of  hydrogens  and  carbons  in  the

6. (15 points) Propose a synthesis of G from H, maleic anhydride, and benzyl bromide (BnBr = 
PhCH2Br). (All of the substituents on the five-membered ring in G are cis to one another, and your 
synthesis must establish this relative configuration.) Your synthesis must use H, maleic anhydride, 
and BnBr. You may use any other reagents in addition to these. Write your synthesis neatly in the 
forward direction, and for each transformation, write the reagents necessary over the arrow.
