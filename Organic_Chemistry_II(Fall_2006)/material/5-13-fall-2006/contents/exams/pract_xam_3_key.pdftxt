(b) What level of  O incorporation ("high" or "low") you would expect to observe in the 
  
recovered acyl chloride? Explain briefly. 

Very low incorporation of labeled Oxygen into acid chloride Cl   is a much better leaving group 
 
than  OH. Hydrolysis will take place much faster than label incorporation. 
 

k2  >>  k1 

(c) Based on your answer to part b, do you think the results of this labeling study definitively 
prove the mechanism of this reaction? Explain briefly. 
No. It is impossible to definitely prove a mechanism incorporation of the label is consistent 
with both SN2 and addition elimination mechanisms.
