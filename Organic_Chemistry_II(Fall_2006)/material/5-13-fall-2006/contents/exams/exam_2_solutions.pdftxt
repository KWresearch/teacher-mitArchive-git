that you have all the pages and in order to gauge the relative difficulty of each 
question. Budget your time accordingly. 
 
Show all your work if you wish to receive partial credit. You should have 8 
pages total: 6 exam pages including this page and 2 blank pages for

1. (30 points total, 2 points per box) In each box below, draw the structure of the major 
product of the reaction. Indicate relative stereochemistry where appropriate. If no reaction 
occurs, put a large X in the box. (Note: “D” = deuterium, 2H)

2. (48 points total) 
a.  Draw the orbitals (by shading the lobes appropriately) at each energy level for 
1,3,5- hexatriene (2 points each). 
b.  Write the number of nodes in the box to the left of each orbital array (1 point each). 
c.  For the ground state of 1,3,5-hexatriene, draw the electron population for each                                
orbital on the line to the right of each orbital array. For each electron, clearly indicate 
whether it is “spin up” or “spin down”. If there are no electrons given orbital, leave it 
blank (1 point each).

d.  For each reaction shown below, indicates which energy level is used to predict the                              
       
stereochemical outcome by shading the appropriate lobes of the entire orbital 
array. (The methyl groups are omitted for clarity; you do not have to draw them.) 
e.  In the box under each reaction arrow, write conrotatory or disrotatory, as appropriate. 
f.  In the box to the right of each reaction arrow, draw the major product of the reaction, 
clearly indicating the relative stereochemistry.

3. (22 points total) Using retrosynthetic analysis, propose a 
synthesis of the molecule to the right (A). You may use any 
reagents you wish, as long as your  starting materials  and any 
other reagent that is used to install a carbon that is found in the  
final product (target molecule A) have no more than 6 carbon  
atoms. For example, 1,3-butadiene and benzene would be              
acceptable, but benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) would not be. 
 
Write your synthesis in the “forward” direction, showing all 
Steps and reagents necessary. (You may include solvents, but 
you are not required to do so.) Draw a box around or circle 
Your final synthesis. 
 
 
Hint: Use a Diels-Alder reaction.
