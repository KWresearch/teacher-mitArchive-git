Directions: 
Closed book exam, no books, notebooks, notes, etc. allowed.  
However, calculators, rulers, and molecular model sets are permitted. 

Please read through the entire exam before beginning, in order to make sure that 
you have all the pages and in order to gauge the relative difficulty of each 
question.  Budget your time accordingly. 

Show all of your work if you wish to receive partial credit. 

You should have 11 pages total:  6 exam pages including this page, 3 pages of 
reference information, and 2 blank pages for scratchwork.

1.  	 (40  points  total  –  5  points  each)  The  molecular  formulas  and  1H  NMR  spectra  of  8 
common  organic  solvents  are  provided  below  and  on  the  following  2  pages.    For  each, 
neatly  draw  the  entire  structure  (i.e.,  not  the  acronym)  in  the  box  provided.    In  some 
cases,  relative  integration  values  (circled  numbers)  and/or  other  information  have  been 
provided. 

Note:  Do  not  represent  functional  groups  with  partial  molecular  formulas  or  other 
abbreviations.  For example, do not use  “Ph” or  “C6H5”  for a phenyl group.  Draw  the entire 
group (including hydrogen atoms).
