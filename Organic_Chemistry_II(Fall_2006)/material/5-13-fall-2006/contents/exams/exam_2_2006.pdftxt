Directions: 
Closed  book  exam,  no  books,  notebooks,  notes,  etc.  allowed.  
Calculators are not permitted for this exam.  However, rulers and molecular model 
sets are permitted. 
 
Please  read  through  the entire exam before beginning,  in order  to make  sure  that 
you  have  all  the  pages  and  in  order  to  gauge  the  relative  difficulty  of  each 
question.  Budget your time accordingly. 
 
Show all of your work if you wish to receive partial credit.  You should have 8 
pages total:  6 exam pages including this page and 2 blank pages for scratchwork.

1.  (30  points  total,  2  points  per  box)  In  each  box  below,  draw  the  structure  of  the  major 
product  of  the  reaction.    Indicate  relative  stereochemistry  where  appropriate.    If  no 
reaction occurs, put a large X in the box.  (Note: “D” = deuterium, 2H)

2.  (48 points total) 
a.   Draw  the orbitals  (by shading  the  lobes appropriately) at each energy  level  for 1,3,5-
hexatriene (2 points each). 
b.  Write the number of nodes in the box to the left of each orbital array (1 point each). 
c.  For  the  ground  state  of  1,3,5-hexatriene,  draw  the  electron  population  for  each 
orbital  on  the  line  to  the  right  of  each  orbital  array.    For  each  electron,  clearly 
indicate whether  it  is  “spin  up”  or  “spin  down”.    If  there  are  no  electrons  in  a  given 
orbital, leave it blank (1 point each).

d.  For  each  reaction  shown  below,  indicate  which  energy  level  is  used  to  predict  the 
stereochemical  outcome  by  shading  the  appropriate  lobes  of  the  entire  orbital 
array.  (The methyl groups are omitted for clarity; you do not have to draw them.) 
e.  In  the  box  under  each  reaction  arrow,  write  conrotatory  or  disrotatory,  as 
appropriate. 
In the box to the right of each reaction arrow, draw the major product of the reaction, 
clearly indicating the relative stereochemistry.

3.    (22  points  total)  Using  retrosynthetic  analysis,  propose  a 
synthesis  of  the  molecule  to  the  right  (A).    You  may  use  any 
reagents  you  wish,  as  long  as  your  starting materials  and  any 
other  reagent  that  is used  to  install a carbon  that  is  found  in  the 
final  product  (target  molecule  A)  have  no  more  than  6  carbon 
atoms.    For  example,  1,3-butadiene  and  benzene  would  be 
acceptable, but benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) would not be.  
 
Write  your  synthesis  in  the  “forward”  direction,  showing  all 
steps  and  reagents  necessary.    (You  may  include  solvents,  but 
you  are  not  required  to  do  so.)    Draw  a  box  around  or  circle 
your final synthesis. 
 
Hint:  Use a Diels-Alder reaction.
