4.  (10 points) An alcohol  (R-OH) was  treated with  sodium hydride and 1-bromo-2-butyne  to give 
compound  D  (molecular  weight  =  166.10).  Using  the  1H  NMR  data  listed  below,  determine  the 
structure of the product and the starting alcohol. Draw the structures in the boxes provided.

6. (15 points) Propose a synthesis of G from H, maleic anhydride, and benzyl bromide (BnBr = 
PhCH2Br). (All of the substituents on the five-membered ring in G are cis to one another, and your 
synthesis must establish this relative configuration.) Your synthesis must use H, maleic anhydride, 
and BnBr. You may use any other reagents in addition to these. Write your synthesis neatly in the 
forward direction, and for each transformation, write the reagents necessary over the arrow.
