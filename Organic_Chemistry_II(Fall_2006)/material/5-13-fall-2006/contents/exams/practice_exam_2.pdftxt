Directions:  Closed book exam, no books, notebooks, notes, etc. allowed. 

Calculators are not permitted for this exam. However, rulers and molecular model 

sets are permitted. 

Please read through the entire exam before beginning, in order to make sure that 

you have all  the pages and  in order to gauge the relative difficulty of each 

question. Budget your time accordingly. 

Show all of your work if you wish to receive partial credit.  You should have 7 

pages total:  5 exam pages  including this page and 2 blank pages  for scratchwork.

of the reagent or major product of the reaction, where appropriate. If no reaction occurs,

put a large X in the box. Clearly indicate the double bond geometry and relative

stereochemistry of the major product, where appropriate.

2.  (28  points  total)   In  a  Nazarov  Cyclization  (below),  treatment  of  a  dienone  with  a  strong 
Lewis acid effects a thermal 4ʌ electrocyclic ring closure, giving intermediate A, and an aqueous 
workup affords the final product (B), the thermodynamically most stable cyclopentenone.

a.	 In  the  diagram  below,  draw  the  ʌ  atomic  orbitals  (by  shading  the  lobes  appropriately)  that 
represent the ʌ system of C (the precursor to A) in the reaction above (2 points each). 
b.  Write the number of nodes in the box to the left of each orbital array (1 point each). 
c.	 For  the  ground  state  of  C,  draw  the  electron  population  for  each  orbital  on  the  line  to  the 
right  of  each  orbital  array.  Clearly  indicate  whether  each  electron  is  “spin  up”  or  “spin 
down”.  If there are no electrons in a given orbital, leave the line blank (1 point each).

d.	 (4  points  each)  For  the  example  of  the  Nazarov  cyclization  below,  in  the  indicated 
boxes  draw  the  direct  product  of  the  electrocyclic  ring  closure  and  the 
cyclopentenone  final  product  after  the  aqueous  workup. 
In  both  cases,  clearly 
indicate stereochemistry and double bond geometry, as appropriate.
