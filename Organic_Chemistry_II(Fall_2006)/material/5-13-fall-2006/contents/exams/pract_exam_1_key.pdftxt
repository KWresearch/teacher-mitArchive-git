(40  points  total  –  5  points  each)  The  molecular  formulas  and  1H  NMR  spectra  of  8 
common  organic  solvents  are  provided  below  and  on  the  following  2  pages.    For  each, 
neatly  draw  the  entire  structure  (i.e.,  not  the  acronym)  in  the  box  provided.    In  some 
cases,  relative  integration  values  (circled  numbers)  and/or  other  information  have  been 
provided. 

Note:    Do  not  represent  functional  groups  with  partial  molecular  formulas  or  other 
abbreviations.   For example, do not use  “Ph” or  “C6H5”  for a phenyl group.   Draw  the entire 
group (including hydrogen atoms).
