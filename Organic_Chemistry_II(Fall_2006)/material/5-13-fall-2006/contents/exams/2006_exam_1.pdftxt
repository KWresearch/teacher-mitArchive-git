4.  (25 points total) An unknown compound (X) contains only carbon and hydrogen, has MW = 
112, and exhibits the spectral data below.  In addition to the IR signal listed below, there are only 
peaks corresponding to C–H stretches (between 3300 and 2900) and several peaks in the 
“fingerprint region”.  Please note that there are no overlapping peaks in either the 1H NMR or the 
13C NMR spectra.  In other words, "What you see is all there is!"

When compound X was treated with excess n-BuLi (n-butyllithium) in tetrahydrofuran and 
then excess CH3I (iodomethane), a new compound (Y) with MW = 168 and 4 signals in its 
13C NMR spectrum was formed. 
 
What are the structures of X (15 points) and Y (10 points)? (Show your work in the space 
below for partial credit consideration.)  Write your final answers in the boxes provided 
below.

5.  (15 points)  In one of our problem sets, cubane (C8H8) was one of the possible 
answers to a structure elucidation problem.  Based on the formula for the Index of 
Hydrogen Deficiency, the IHD of cubane is 5.  However, as you know, a cube has 
six sides.  In other words, it looks like cubane has 6 rings and thus that its IHD 
should also be 6. 
 

Please provide an explanation (not the formula used to calculate the IHD) for 
this apparent discrepancy in the space below.
