3.	 A biochemist, Sal Monella, has come to you to ask your assistance in testing a 
promising biosynthetic hypothesis. She wishes to have two samples of methylsuccinic 
acid specifically labeled with 14      C as shown below. The source of the isotope, for 
financial reasons, is the salt                
Na14CN . Outline a synthesis that will accomplish this 
objective.
