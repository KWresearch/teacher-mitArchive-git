1.  Make sure your exam has 9 numbered pages plus a periodic table. 
2.  Write your initials on each page. 
3. 
Look over the entire exam before you begin to familiarize yourself with its 
length. Do what you know first, then attempt the harder problems. 
Show all of your work. Partial credit receives points!

 1. (4 pts) When N,N-dimethylaminopyridine reacts with one equivalent of acid,
the sp2 nitrogen becomes protonated.Why don't you see protonation at the sp3 
nitrogen when you know that the more p character an orbital has, the more stable 
it is with a positive charge?

The  Sp3  Nitrogen is  actually Sp2.  The lone pair on nitrogen is in  a P orbital 
&can delocalize into the pyridine ring. The lone pair of electrons on the Nitrogen 
atom in the ring  are orthogonal to the ring & cannot delocalize .Those electrons 
are more available for bonding and more basic.

7. 

(10 pts) Under basic hydrolysis conditions, a nitrile goes through a primary 
amide intermediate before becoming a carboxylate. Show the mechanism for this 
reaction and explain why it is NOT a facile method for converting nitriles into 
carboxylates.

Base catalyzed hydydrolysis of nitriles is not a facile process because NH2
is not good leaving group( -OH  is better!) There, fore, the reaction is slow.
