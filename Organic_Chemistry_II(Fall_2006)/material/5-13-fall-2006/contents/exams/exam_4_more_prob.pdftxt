Dr. Kimberly L. Berkowski                                                                 Organic Chemistry II 
 
 

EXAM #4 MORE PROBLEMS 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

DO THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE THE OTHER 
SET OF EXTRA PROBLEMS! 
(they are more relevant to the exam material) 

 
 
 
                      What to expect on Exam #4: 
1.  pKas of ketones, diketones, esters, etc. 
2.  ~3 Transformations – supply missing reagents 
3.  ~10 Transformations – supply missing product 
4.  ~2 Mechanisms 
5.  ~2 Synthesis 

What NOT to expect on Exam #4: 
1. 
Determine mechanism by crossover and stereochemical experiments 
(end of Friday’s lecture) 
Neighboring Group Participation – Do not work through problems 
#8, 24 & 25 on the Extra Problem Set.
