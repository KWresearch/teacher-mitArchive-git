1.  (36 points  total)   Use  the  information provided below and  the  IR and NMR  spectra on  the 
next page to answer the following questions. 

a.  (10  points)  Determine  the  molecular  formula  that  satisfies  the  following  data  (circle 
your final answer):        EA (found):  C, 61.85; H, 5.19; and M+ = 194. 

 
 
b.  (6  points)  Calculate  the  Index  of  Hydrogen  Deficiency  (IHD)  for  the  molecule  in  a, 
above (circle your final answer). 

 

 

 
c.  (5  points)  An  IR  spectrum  of  the  molecule  in  a  appears  on  the  following  page.    What 
functional  group  or  groups  correspond(s)  to  the  peak  at  1731  cm–1  in  the  spectrum?  
Draw the structure of this/these group(s), showing all bonds (i.e. single, double, triple). 

 
 
 
 
 
d.  (10  points) Using  the  information  in  a,  b,  and  c,  above,  and  the  1H NMR  and  13C NMR 
spectra  on  the  next  page,  determine  a  structure  of  this  unknown  molecule  that  is 
consistent with all data.   Draw  the structure of  this molecule below  (circle your  final 
answer). 

 

 
 
 
e.  (5 points) Provide an explanation  for  the  fact  that  the  triplet at 8.7 ppm  in  the  1H NMR 
spectrum appears so far downfield. 

 

 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
f. 

(EXTRA  CREDIT,  3  points,  2  points):    What  type  of  bond  (e.g.  P–N  double  bond)  and 
what  vibrational mode  (stretch,  bend,  or wag)  are  indicated  by  the  strong  peak  at  1244 
cm–1 in the IR spectrum for this compound (next page)?  Be specific.

2.  (20  points)    Sometimes  it  is  possible  to  determine  the  structure  of  an  organic  molecule 
without using the three-step process we discussed  in class.  An unknown organic molecule 
containing only carbon, hydrogen, and  fluorine was analyzed by  1H NMR spectroscopy, 
providing the following data: 
 
1H NMR:  7.45 (dd, J = 8.0, 1.3, 1H), 7.14 (dd, J = 7.6, 1.7, 1H), 7.10 (ddd, J = 7.6, 7.5, 1.3, 
1H), 6.95 (ddd, 8.0, 7.5, 1.7, 1H), 2.38 (s, 3H). 

 
What  is  the  structure  of  this  molecule?    Clearly  draw  your  answer  (one  and  only  one) 
below and circle it.

3.  (20  points)    An  unknown  compound  X  (C5H8)  with  a  signal  at  2107  cm–1  in  the  IR  was 
treated with a reagent (A) and added to another unknown compound Y with the following in 
the  1H NMR  spectrum  (in ppm  relative  to  tetramethylsilane):   9.67  (s, 1H), 7.1-7.4  (m, 5H).  
After an acidic work-up and purification,  the product of  the reaction (Z) was analyzed by 1H 
NMR  spectroscopy.    The  singlet  at  9.67  ppm  for  compound  Y  was  no  longer  present,  but 
the 5H multiplet was.   The other new peaks  in  the NMR spectrum of Z were a 1H septet at 
2.01  ppm,  a  singlet  at  3.45  ppm,  also  integrating  to  1H,  and  finally  a  6H  doublet  at  1.05 
ppm. 

What  are  the  structures  of  compounds  X,  Y,  and  Z?    Clearly  draw  and  label  all  3  below.  
Also propose an effective reagent A for this transformation and label it clearly below.
