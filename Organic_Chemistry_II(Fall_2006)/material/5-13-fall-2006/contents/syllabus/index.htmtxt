***** Overview *****
This intermediate organic chemistry course focuses on the methods used to
identify the structure of organic molecules, advanced principles of organic
stereochemistry, organic reaction mechanisms, and methods used for the
synthesis of organic compounds. Topics include spectroscopy, spectrometry, and
structure elucidation with an emphasis on the application of infrared and
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Additional specific topics include:
    * Molecular Orbital Theory and Pericyclic Reactions
          o Modern Concepts of Bonding and Aromaticity
          o The Woodward-Hoffmann Rules
          o Mechanism of Pericyclic Reactions and Applications in Synthesis
    * Chemistry of Functional Groups
          o Ethers, Epoxides, Amines and Carboxylic Acids
          o Enols, Enolates
    * Chemistry of Reactive Intermediates
          o Carbocations, Radicals

***** Molecular Models *****
Several units in 5.13 will emphasize stereochemical aspects of organic
reactions and molecules. To help you visualize stereochemical concepts, we
recommend that you purchase the WH Freeman HSG Molecular Structure Model SetTM
. Note that you will be permitted to bring model sets to the hour exams and the
final.
***** Problem Sets *****
Eight problem sets will be required throughout the semester and are worth 10%
of your final grade. These problem sets should be handed in to your recitation
instructor at the beginning of lecture on the dates announced (or earlier). No
late work will be accepted.
Written solutions are given for each problem set in the assignments section. In
addition, "drill problems" will be assigned approximately every week in
conjunction with the weekly reading assignments.
***** Exams *****
There will be four exams in addition to the final. These exams will be held
during the class lecture time. Review sessions will be scheduled prior to each
exam. Please notify course instructors and the Chemistry Education Office of
any conflicts or concerns regarding taking exams at the scheduled time.
Conflict exams generally will be scheduled for the same day as the regular
exam.
Absolutely no make-up exams will be given for a missed exam. To accommodate
unexpected illnesses, family emergencies, and other conflicts, one of the 50-
minute exams will be dropped when calculating your final grade. The purpose of
the dropped exam is to relieve extra stress and pressure during a particularly
difficult time in the semester. Use this option with caution because you cannot
predict if a serious emergency will arise later in the semester.
***** Regrade Policy *****
You may submit a graded 50-minute exam to your TA for a regrade up to one week
after it is returned to you. Oral or late requests for regarding will not be
accepted. Include a justification for the basis of your regrade. Please note:
We will regrade the entire exam and photocopy it for our records.
***** Grading *****
The 50-minute exam with the lowest score will be dropped.
                  Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                                PERCENTAGES
Remaining Three 50-Minute Exams (300 pts) 60%
Final Exam (150 pts)                      30%
Problem Sets (50 pts)                     10%
***** Academic Integrity *****
Students will not turn in assignments that are the result of copying the work
of another student or by using the work or solutions from this course given in
previous years. However, discussing the homework problems is permitted and
encouraged after attempting to work the problems independently. During an
examination, a student will not:
   1. Accept or use information of any kind from other students.
   2. Represent the work of another student as his or her own.
   3. Use aids to memory other than those expressly permitted by the examiner.
Following an examination, a student will not try to deceive instructors or
graders by mispresenting or altering his or her previous work. In advance of an
exam, a student will not knowingly obtain access to the exam questions.
The following excerpt was taken from section 10.2 of MIT's Policies and
Procedures, "MIT assumes that all students come to the Institute for a serious
purpose and expects them to be responsible individuals who demand of themselves
high standards of honesty and personal conduct. Cheating, plagiarism,
unauthorized collaboration, deliberate interference with the integrity of the
work of others, fabrication or falsification of data, and other forms of
academic dishonesty are considered serious offenses for which disciplinary
penalties can be imposed." Thus, any infraction of academic integrity will be
dealt with as outlined in section 10.2 of MIT Policies and Procedures and could
result in disciplinary penalties, including suspension and expulsion.
