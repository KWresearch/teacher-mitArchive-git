6.  a)  When methanol containing an oxygen-18 isotope is treated with 
benzenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine, a product A is formed.  When A is treated 
with sodium hydroxide, methanol is formed again along with another product B, 
and the methanol contains none of the isotope.  Identify products A and B.
