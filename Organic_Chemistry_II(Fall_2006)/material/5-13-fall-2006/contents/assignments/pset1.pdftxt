NOTE:  If mass spectrometry (MS) data are provided, the highest molecular ion given corresponds to  the 
molecular ion (M+), unless otherwise noted. 

1.	 Derive an express ion for the largest possible IHD for a neutral (no overall charge; zwitterions ok), 
stable compound having n carbon atoms and zero or more H, N, and O atoms (e.g., CH4O).  For the 
purposes of this problem, “stable” is defined as a structure whose atoms all form the “standard” 
number of bonds.  That is, all of the C atoms have 4 bonds, all the H (if any) have 1, all the N (if any) 
have, and all the O (if any) have 2. 
Express your answer as function of n, and illustrate with two specific structures.  Calculate and 
provide the numerical value of the IHD for your examples. 

2.	 What EA, IR, and MS data would you expect for the following 10 common laboratory solvents?  Draw 
the structure of each solvent as part of your answer. 
(a)  benzene; (b) toluene; (c) ethanol; (d) tetrahydrofuran; (e) diethyl ether; (f) dichloromethane; (g) 
chloroform; (h) carbon tetrachloride; (i) acetonitrile; (j) hexane. 

3.	 Luminol  is the key component in an extraordinarily sensitive chemical test for detecting blood.  If you 
have watched even just one or two episodes of Forensic Files or CSI, you have probably seen how 
useful this compound is in the analys is of crime scenes, even where no blood is visible by eye. 
Draw the structure of luminol; determine its MF and IHD; calculate the EA data that would you expec t 
for this compound, and list the IR data you would expect to find for this compound. 

4.	 Draw four (4) structures that satisfy the following experimental data.  Diastereomers (but not 
enantiomers in this case) are considered to be different structures. 
EA (found): C, 67.55; H, 12.75; N, 19.69

MS: 71

IR:  2932 cm–1 

5.	 Draw three (3) structures that are cons istent with the following elemental analysis.  Diastereomers 
(but not enantiomers in this case) are considered to be different structures. 
EA (found): C, 92.26; H, 7.74
