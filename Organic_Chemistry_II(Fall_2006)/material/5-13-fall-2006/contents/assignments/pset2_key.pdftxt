1.  (self­explanatory) 

2.  a.  Starting materials:  1­bromopropane, PPh3, then nBuLi/THF (or NaHMDS/ether or 
toluene which actually gives higher cis selectivity (fyi)) then pentanal.  OR:  1­
bromopentane and propanal, etc. 
b.  trans­3­octene 
1
c. 
H NMR coupling constants (Jcis=6­12 and Jtrans=12­18) 
d.  Lindlar reduction of 3­octyne and Li/NH3 reduction of 3­octyne.  Compare NMR 
spectra to that/those obtained for Wittig product(s).

3.  4­(para­nitrophenyl)­1­butanol. 

4.  2­cyclohexenone (conjugated).  The M­28 in the MS is loss of C=O. 
5.  C4 H8 O in both cases. 

a.  3­buten­1­ol  (CH2=CH­CH2­CH2­OH, the 5.0 ­ 6.0 ppm pattern is typical for a 
terminal alkene attached to a CH2.) 

b.  1­buten­3­ol  (CH2=CH­CH(OH)­CH3, the 5.0 ­ 6.0 ppm pattern is typical for a 
terminal alkene attached to a CH.  Hard to see, but 5.9 ppm peak is a ddd, and the other 2 
alkenes are geminal, exhibiting only cis and trans and trans coupling to the alkenyl CH.)
