Problem Set #2

This problem set is worth 50/8 = 6.25 points toward your final grade; each problem is worth 1.25 points. 

DUE DATE: Friday, September 22, 2006, in lecture, before lecture (at 12:05 p.m.).

NOTE:  If mass spectrometry (MS) data are provided, the highest molecular ion given corresponds to  the 
molecular ion (M+), unless otherwise noted. 

1.	 Predict 10 m/z values that you would expect to see in an MS of the following compound.  Using the 
convention presented in class, indicate the site (and value) of each fragmentation on your drawing of 
the structure. 

2.	 The Wittig Reaction (McMurry, pp 706-708) is one of the most reliable methods for the 
stereoselective preparation of alkenes. 
a.	 Propose a synthesis of cis-3-octene using the Witt ig reaction as the final step and no starting 
material with more than 5 carbon atoms, except for Ph3P. 
b.	 What other product(s ) may be formed in the Wittig reaction? 
c.	 What spectroscopic method(s) would allow you to differentiate between/among these different
products?  List the methods and the key data values for your determination. 
d.	 Propose a chemical means by which you could confirm your assignment in (c ).
