1.	 Treatment  of  compound 1  below  with  a  strong base  (e.g., n-BuLi)  gives  a  heterocycle  with  a 5-
membered  ring  treatment  with  a  weak  acid  (work -up).  Account  for  the  relative  stereochemistry 
observed in the product. 

2.  Propose  a  mechanism  for  the  reaction  below  that  involves  a  thermal  4π  electrocyclic  ring 
closure.  Clearly  indicate the relative stereochemis try in all intermediates. 

3.	 Based  on  the  photochemical  and  thermal  electrocyclic  reactions  of  compound  2  below, 
comment  on  the  nature  of  the  π  system  in  its  9-membered  ring.  Account  for  the  relative 
stereochemistry observed in each of the two reactions. 

4.	 Heating  compound  3  below  at  reflux  in  toluene  in  the  presence  of  methyl  acrylate  affords  two 
products,  A  and  B  in  a  1:1  ratio  of  diastereomers.  With  a  catalytic  amount  of  base,  A  is 
converted  to  B.  What  are  the  structures  of  A  and  B?  Clearly  indicate  the  relative 
stereochemistry in each.  Hint: A Diels -Alder reaction is involved in part of the mechanism.

Alder reaction  in each  case.  Starting  with  the Diels-Alder  reaction  you decide  to use, write  your 
synthesis in the “forward” direction, showing all steps and reagents necessary. 

6.	 Compound A undergoes  a ring-opening reaction when heated at 100 °C, but no reaction occurs 
when  C  is  subjected  to  the  same  conditions.  Suggest  a  mechanism  for  the  conversion  of  A  to 
B,  identify  the  type  of  reaction  involved,  and  explain  why  C  does  not  undergo  a  similar 
transformation.

the  following  problems  cover  material  that  we  will  not  have  covered  by  the  time  Problem  Set  4  is  due. 
Not all of the problems on the exam will be like this, but they are representative of some of the ones you 
might encounter. 
For each of the following problems: 
i. 	 Fil l in the boxes with the predicted product or necessary starting material.  Indicate 
relative stereochemistry and/or double bond geometry, where appropriate.  If no reaction 
occurs, write “no reaction” and skip parts ii. and iii. 
ii. 	 Classify each pericyclic reaction according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules ([π4s + π2s] 
cycloaddition, e.g.).
