5.  Account for the fact that treatment of 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione with I2 
and NaOH gives a precipitate of iodoform even though it is not a methyl ketone 
(show the mechanism).  Note that besides iodoform, the other product of the 
reaction (after acidification) is two equivalents of benzoic acid.

equivalent of LDA, followed by 1 equivalent of:

ketone over the b,g-unsaturated isomer.  b)  Provide a mechanism for this 
reaction in aqueous NaOH.  c)  Provide a mechanism for this reaction in dilute 
aqueous H2SO4.
