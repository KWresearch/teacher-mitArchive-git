The goal of this research project is to enable you to engage in a more extensive discussion of a topic of 
your own choice within the context of media studies.  The topic that you choose may be one that you’ve touched on 
in some of your previous writing (essay or section assignments) or a completely new topic. It is important to choose 
a topic that (a) generates both intellectual interest and challenge for you (b) connects with critical issues within the 
course (c) can be addressed within a ten-twelve page essay.   
   
         Generating intellectual questions, defining a topic area and then narrowing down to a topic is the first stage of 
this project.  For Proposal Take Two, write a two-page proposal for your essay; append a working bibliography of 
at least five sources.  Your proposal should tell the reader what intellectual questions motivated your choice of topic 
area, and should describe how you have narrowed your topic so that you can research and write your essay.   What 
issues/questions do you plan to discuss? At this point you don’t need to know your argument or thesis statement, but 
you do need to know the contours of debate or key themes. You should schedule a proposal conference with your 
section leader to discuss research and writing strategies. You will probably be asked to revise your proposal to 
clarify the direction of your research. 
           While we hope that students will choose to write about a wide variety of topics, we expect that each essay 
will present a clear argument rather than simply review the literature on a given topic.  On 11/21, you will submit a 
draft or “first version” and will then receive comments from your section leader. The final version will be due on the 
last day of class (12/10). Oral presentations will give you the chance to share your research findings with us and  the 
class. 
 
*Note: If any student wishes to submit an accompanying media project (e.g. video, website design, CD), we can 
discuss how to combine multiple media forms.
