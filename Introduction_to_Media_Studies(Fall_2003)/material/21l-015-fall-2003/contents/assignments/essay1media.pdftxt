Prof. Andrea Walsh 
 
ESSAY #1 
Due: Fri. 9/19 to your section leader.  Suggested length: 5 typed pg, double-spaced. 
Please keep a copy for your own records. Attach a letter describing what you see as 
the strengths and weaknesses of the essay. 
 
 
      The goal of this essay is to provide you with the opportunity to analyze your own 
relationship to media with references to concepts presented in course readings, 
discussions and lectures. You can think of this piece as a short “media autobiography” 
that touches on central themes in your experiences with media. In your discussion, you 
may want to interpret significant media memories or important media artifacts in your 
life. 
        Incorporate at least 3 course readings into your analysis. Some suggestions (don’t 
feel limited by these):  How can concepts such as “the global village”, ”hot and cool 
media”, “high and low culture”,  “cultural literacy”, the “culture industry”, 
“pseudoindividualism”, etc.  help you to understand yourself more fully? 
            Be sure that you present your self-narrative clearly and incorporate course 
readings thoughtfully with citations and bibliography.    There is an option to expand and 
revise this at the end of term.
