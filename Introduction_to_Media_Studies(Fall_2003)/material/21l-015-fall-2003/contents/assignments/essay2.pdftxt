ESSAY 2: THINKING ABOUT PRINT CULTURE 
Due Fri. 10/17 (over email to section leader as a Word document): Suggested length: 5 pg, 
plus bibliography. 
 
 
 
 
The goal of this essay is to enable you to engage in a critical analysis of an aspect of 
 
contemporary print culture (e.g., books, magazines, newspapers).   Below are some options for 
the essay.  However, if you have another suggestion for a topic, please submit a proposal (over 
email) to your section leader by Friday Oct.3. 
 
1.Some theorists contend that the print text “inevitably directs, governs, controls, indeed 
determines the reader’s response to it.” (Radway, p.467).  Janice Radway, however, asks us to 
consider “other reading theories…that call for a rethinking of the concept of literacy…because 
they maintain it is the reader who controls the reading process, not the text.” (Radway, p.467)    
In the context of this debate, research at least two different fiction or nonfiction communities 
(e.g. science fiction, mystery/thriller, romance) on the Internet.  How does your analysis compare 
with Radway’s notion of interpretive community? (Note: For the purposes of this assignment, 
it’s a good idea to be familiar with the genre of literature and at least a few of the books being 
discussed.) 
 
2. Stuart Hall, et al. in “The Social Production of News” see news as constructed from a “frame 
of meanings familiar to the audience.” (Hall, et. al, p.646.) These “background assumptions”, 
according to Hall, may have biases and limitations that are less-than-visible to readers. Drawing 
upon Hall as well as other writers, analyze the coverage (print and photographic) of at least one 
domestic or foreign policy issue in two newspapers with some difference in orientation (e.g. 
Boston Globe and Herald, U.S. paper and paper from another country).  If you wish, you may 
also integrate analysis of some TV news coverage into your essay. Comparatively, what 
“frames” (e.g. conflict, consensus) do you identify as operating in the stories? Where do the 
stories differ?  Where do they converge?  What aspects of the stories seem to be missing?  What 
are the implications of your analysis for the ideal of objectivity in journalism? 
 
3. For some communications scholars, such as Neil Postman, print culture is dying, losing its 
appeal in the age of televisual and digital technology.  Analyze the “Harry Potter” craze in the 
light of Postman’s contention. Draw upon some newspaper and magazine articles to support your 
argument.
