ESSAY #3 
Due: Fri. 11/14 as a Word attachment over email to your section leader.  Suggested 
length: 4 typed pg, double-spaced. Please keep a copy for your own records. Attach 
a letter describing what you see as the strengths and weaknesses of the essay. 
 
      The goal of this essay is to enable you to analyze the power of a film (or a few films) 
as a vehicle for storytelling and/or cultural representation. Since comparative analysis 
typically sharpens our understanding of a particular text, this assignment offers several 
options for comparison. Be careful to select a few scenes for analysis, not the entire film!  
 

(a)  Analyze the power and meaning of an individual film in comparison with the 
print text from which it was adapted.  (You may choose The Man Who Would Be 
King).     

 

(b)  Analyze a film (e.g.Scarface, Invasion of the Body Snatchers) adapted from an 
earlier original.  In what ways does the meaning change in the more recent 
version? In what ways does each version reflect its historical era? 

 
      (c) Analyze the representation of a social problem or a social group (e.g. racial/ethnic, 
gender, occupational) in a few contemporary films. What similarities and differences do 
you see in each film? In what ways do the films create a pattern of representation or a 
discourse or frame for understanding a social problem? 
 
       Note: You do not need to use outside sources, although you may find some course 
readings helpful.
