Section Writing Assignment: Monday Sept. 15—Advertising 
Suggested length: 1 ½ pages, typed, double-spaced. 
 
       Select 5 print ads and bring them to section to talk about on Monday evening.  
Choose 3 of these ads and briefly analyze their appeal, drawing upon at least two of the 
readings for Monday. Consider the type of product(s) advertised, the audience(s) the ad 
seems to target and the imagery of the ad. Some questions to consider in interpreting a 
particular advertisement: 
 
--To what degree does the ad promote the product(s) or brand on the basis of a pre-
existing consumer need (e.g. soap)? To what extent does the advertisement attempt to 
create a need for a new or enhanced product? 
 
--In what ways does the ad highlight (a) the effectiveness of the product and/or (b) its 
association with desired cultural ideals (e.g., youthfulness, courage, achievement, 
rebellion)?  What beauty and body ideals are promoted by this advertisement? 
 
--Do you view this ad as manipulating its readership and/or reflecting their desires?
