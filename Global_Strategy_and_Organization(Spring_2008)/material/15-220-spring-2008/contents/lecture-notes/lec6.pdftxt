ICICI Context—History and Banking Industry

Quick facts about ICICI
ICICI - Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India – was formed in 1955
•
It was an initiative of the World Bank, the Government of India and representatives 
•
of Indian industry with the principal objective to create a development financial 
institution for providing medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian 
businesses
In the 1990s, ICICI transformed itself from a development financial institution to 
become a diversified financial services group.
In 1999, ICICI became the first Indian company and the first bank or financial 
institution from Asia (non-Japanese) to be listed on the NYSE.
ICICI is nowadays India’s second largest bank with assets of US$ 38.5 bn and 
profits after tax of US$ 461 mn

Quick facts about the Banking Industry in India
The financial services sector in India has been historically very regulated and mainly 
•
controlled by the government.
1980s (cid:198) 90% of the branches in the country were controlled by the government 
after a series of nationalizations in 1959, 1969 and 1980.
“However, as might be expected in a nationalized industry, banks in India were 
characterized by their inefficiency, high intermediation costs and high non-performing 
assets (NPAs).” 
In the mid 80s and early 90s, the financial services sector began a transformation 
that was part of a comprehensive reform process that impacted the entire economy 
in India

Context - Indian Diaspora

• About 6 million Indian citizens and a further 12 million persons of Indian 
origin (PIO) lived outside India in 2001, and together were estimated to 
have a combined wealth of over $300 billion.
– From those, 4.1 Million are in the GCC (Gulf Cooperating Countries), 2.2 
Million are in the UK, 1.7 Million in the US and 0.8 Million are in Canada

Should ICI Go International?
..they should focus in the Indian market …the 
As part of its international strategy, 
ICICI should cater to the Indian 
market in India is big and very promising in the 
population abroad as well as to the 
near future, the competition is going to India to 
NRI population looking to expand 
compete with them and the effort to deliver a 
their businesses internationally.  Given 
good service and portfolio outside India is going 
the leaner and more responsive 
to be really hard and the competition in the 
structure of ICICI, the company is 
outside market is huge. (Roger Skogmo, Chris 
well suited to cater to international 
Stepanian, Rupin Mohan, Hiroshi Onuki)
markets (Mirza Ahmed, Barry Bunn, Masahide 
Kawakami, Hyunyoung Kim, Damien Liot)

ICICI has been very successful in India by 
using technology to become a more efficient 
financial institution. However, this competitive 
advantage is limited to local level (Pierre 
Cleroux, Xoliswa Kakana, Nobu Takei, William 
Harrison)

We do not recommend ICICI to expand 
internationally before taking up a larger place in 
the domestic market. Technology innovation and 
excellent management
team can lead to the success in the domestic 
market. By building a back office support 
outsourcing group, ..ICICI can build partnerships 
..to better position itself for 
future expansion into foreign markets (Justine Li, 
Rohit Kashyap, Steven Martin, Virgil Chan)

Why Internationalize?
• Running out of space in India?
– Still weak, dominated by state owned
– But public ownership, dispersion is barrier
– Spreads already narrowing  -- 3 yrs from 9 to 3.5
– Long way to go to consolidate ICICI as Indian bank

• Great opportunities abroad
– NRI’s
– India Inc going international
– Other countries with weak infrastructure that can be leapfrogged by tech
– BPO
Industry requires global scale?

•

• Going Head to Head with the Best (Ghoshal et al)

•

• Diversification

Learning, Differentiating ICICI in India>> Established Int’ls, Indian 
International, Domestic
RATs>>which models, competencies 
relevant?
Platforms>>In what way can 
internationalization strengthen these core 
competencies for both India and abroad? –

ICICI

• What is ICICI good at?
– Very efficient bank (process, services, technology) – late mover 
advantage in Financial Services
– Products targeted at the Indian Immigrant Community
– Recognized Indian Brand

• Services
– Front-office: Products & Services targeting the Indian Diaspora
• Under ICICI Brand name
• White-label
– Back-office: Services offered to other banks

• Markets
– Given ICICI core competences, what should be the positioning of ICICI 
in terms of products and services internationally?

Phase 2 - Target the Non Resident Indians and 
Persons of Indian origin who still maintain contact

capital intensive. This strategy also 
leverages ICIC’s capabilities in IT and 
business processes.  

(Karen Kotkow, Martin Croot, Diego Parlaghy, 
Chihon Park, Franco Herrera)

• As ICICI grow it should follow the 
following criteria:
Focus on countries with:
• market size (>$5B GDP), 
high growth potential (>2% growth),
• significant Indian populations (Indian 
population>5% of local population)

Targets and Sequencing
In international markets with a large NRI 
population, ICICI could partner with a 
company that has a large network in the 
geography being penetrated (e.g. in the 
US they could partner with Wells Fargo 
which has an extensive nationwide 
network). They could also introduce a 
direct banking service or a virtual bank 
service to create easier access to the bank 
without having to incur with the costs of 
international branch offices. (Yining Zhao,  
Merritt Mayher, Flavio Fomin, Frank Parker)

“Success in rural, then surround and 
conquer cities”.. Applying this approach to 
ICICI, they could begin to build their foot print by 
targeting developing countries first, regardless of 
NRI population, where competition is not as 
intensive as in advanced country, leveraging their 
cost effective and technology based competitive 
advantage. When they accumulated enough 
experience and financial muscle, then they could 
enter developed countries like the US and EU in a 
later step. (Masaharu Aiuchi, Peter Curley, Tuang Lim,
Brian Wilson, Kent Xu)

Retail banking involves a multitude of services 
which require not only technical and financial 
expertise in this sector, but also significant visible 
presence and understanding of the local cultures. 
To the extent that ICICI does decide to expand, it 
has to make incremental moves in the foreign 
market. It’s probably prudent to pick one region 
and start building a global brand from there.  
(Carla Burigatto, Yoshiro Tokoro, Paulo Centeno, 
Gaurav Gupta)

 

It should not arrive at its decisions on 
which markets to explore based on
just modeling and reasoning. Instead it 
should experiment in all 3 of these
markets in an intelligent fashion. It 
should begin by establishing a base or
an "outpost" which it can gradually 
grow in strength into a "source" and
perhaps later into a "lead".  (Christopher 
Stepanian, Venkat Rangamani)

ICICI could also try to identify markets in the world, 
which have conditions similar to those that permitted the 
success of the company in India, and install a subsidiary 
there. Same issues, same solutions. By replicating it 
successful Indian strategy, ICICI could, thanks to its 
technology and offers, fill the gap of un-existing services 
in other region of the world, and capture significant 
market share there. Typically, developing countries in a 
transition phase could be interesting targets. (Lars Husby, 
Etienne Barritault, Eduardo Amorin, Michael Chiu, Adrien Lehideux)

Questions for Dell-Lenovo
•How has the PC industry evolved in recent years?  
What markets will exhibit the best opportunities in the 
future?
