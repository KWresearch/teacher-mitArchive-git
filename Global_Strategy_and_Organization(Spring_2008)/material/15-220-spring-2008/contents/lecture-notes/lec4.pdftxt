Today’s Focus -- CEMEX

• Understand how firms “internationalize” by “exploiting” home 
base advantage – RATs and CAGE
• Understand how firms “enhance” capabilities by creating 
“virtual diamonds”-- Platforms
• From “middle” country 
base

Industry (boundaries, 
structure)

Country/region 
(diamond)

Firm (process of 
expansion)

Why Cemex?

• Major success in industry with moderate “globalization 
drivers”
– #1 Concrete, #3 Cement, #1 Cement transport

• Major success from a country without obvious advantage

• Interesting business model

• Interesting global organizational structure

Why Internationalize?

• Why did Zambrano decide that CEMEX had to globalize in 
order to remain independent?

Globalization Drivers in Cement Industry*

Market similarity

Scale economies

Scope economies

diversification, pooling,
Transfer of best practice,

Advantage

Initially none, late found RATs
from emerging markets base
Forcing open, but 
barriers remain

Regulation

How helpful was Mexican diamond?

• FCs-- quite good re engineers.
• FCs -- not so good in terms of access to, cost of capital
• DCs quite interesting re RATs
• Rivalry --CEMEX’s market power results in high  home profitability

How to Internationalize?

• What are the key stages of CEMEX's international development since 
the early 1980s?
– What were the reasons for each stage (opportunity to exploit or 
enhance)?
– What challenges did CEMEX face at each stage?
– What did Cemex ultimately gain from each stage?
• What are the elements of CEMEX's Business Model that have 
enabled it to grow internationally in a “local” industry from a home 
base that does not have strong advantages?

Competency Exploiting Internationalization

• RATs tests your potential to exploit existing 
competencies internationally:

– Are they Relevant?
– Are they Appropriable?
– Are they Transferable?

Competency Enhancing Internationalization

• Tap into Strategic Platforms that enhance core 
competencies
– Countries/locations that facilitate development of 
capabilities that provide access to other segments, 
activities
– Countries/locations that create/extend the virtual 
diamond

Stepping Out --Why Spain?

• Bulk up, in competitors face
• Attractive, fit
• Explore with study, terminals

• RATs (exploit)
– Discovered that operations capabilities were are plus – took 
about 2 years 7 >> 24% margins

• Diamond (enhance)
– Increased access reduced cost of capital (financial platform)

Why Caribbean?

• Match transport model
• Integrate ops
• Venezuela (Vencemos) provides export platform for 
Caribbean and US (not subject to anti-dumping)
• Colombia somewhat different (large inland market)

Change in Integration Process

• Early model
– Mexican takeover
• Current model
– The CEMEX Way

Business Model Innovations
• Retail bag customers

– What does customer want

– Benefit – definition, almost lock in, more stable 
demand

• Ready mix customers

– 20 minute guarantee

For Wednesday
Arbitrage and Outsourcing

• Using an example from your own firm:
– Describe the operation including its product/geographical focus, 
– whether it does product development as well, 
– whether it is responsible for its local/regional market as well, 
– how it fits into overall organization, e.g. part of global business 
unit, country unit, etc.
– Using Ferdows’ terminology, is it an offshore source, and 
outpost, a server, a source, a lead, or a contributor?
– How does this role relate to the “diamond” for the country and 
for the concepts of arbitrage as outlined by Ghemawat?
