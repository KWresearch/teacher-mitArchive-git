Welcome to Bollywood!

15.220 Spring 2007

Discussion
Thinking about a Bollywood movie you have seen, what was it target audience? Would this movie 
have broad appeal to an American audience?  Why or why not? If the movie was changed to 
speak to American audience, do you think it would still appeal to an Indian audience?  Can a 
movie appeal to both successfully? 

How well do movies travel across borders?
– As a general matter?
– From India?

Is the filmmaking industry global? 
– What factors would you consider in determining how global an industry is or should be?

For Hollywood, does Bollywood represent a competitive threat?  What kind of opportunities does 
Bollywood present for American filmmakers?  

Based on your analysis of the global movie industry, is the world flat or not?

•

• What is the best strategy for Bollywood to go global?  
– Should they pursue a niche market?  
– What kind of relationships should Indian filmmakers build with Hollywood movie industry? 

•

How should American filmmakers respond to Bollywood’s attempts to go global?

Global regimes/ National regulation

The world is flatter, but…

• Differences still matter

– Resources
– Costs
– Tastes, experiences, styles
– Business models
– Etc.

Flat(ter) World>>Game(s) Over!

• “Purely local” firms
– Foreign firms can/do enter at low cost
– New distributors are organized to tap lowest cost 
source regardless of location

• Firms that have competed internationally primarily on 
the basis of (resource, labor) cost
– With decreasing transport barriers, there is only 
one lowest cost source
– China is the current focus, but others will enter in 
time

Questions for Nokia Case

• What were the primary characteristics of Finland that allowed Nokia to build 
a global leadership position in mobile phones?  Which of these were the 
result of explicit policy choices?
• To what extent were these advantages unique to Finland, compared to 
Germany or other countries in Western Europe, the U.S. or Japan?
• To what extent did Nokia “reach beyond” these “home-base” characteristics 
in establishing its leading position?
• Do you think the same cycle of establishing advantage (and the associated 
business model) in an advanced country and diffusing it to other markets 
(including emerging markets) is still relevant in this industry? Why or why 
not?
