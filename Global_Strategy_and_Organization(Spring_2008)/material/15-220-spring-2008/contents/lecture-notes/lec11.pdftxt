Ghosn and Japanese Identity—SF 2006

Student responses removed due to copyright restrictions.

Global or Multi-cultural

•
SF 2006
• Multicultural or Global Leadership?
If you take a manager, educated in one country, make him traveling/working around 
the globe, he might become a global leader. CG case triggers the question if it is his 
multicultural background or the fact that he has been a "global" executive which is 
the key to his success (in Brazil, US and Europe before assuming a new position in 
Japan)...or simply both, multicultural and global

What is a Global Leader?
The Business Leader
– Capture the full benefits of integrated worldwide operations
– Strategist
– Architect of its worldwide asset and resource configuration
– Coordinator of transactions across national borders

The Country Leader
– To be sensitive and responsive to the local market
– Sensor and Interpreter of local opportunities and threats 
– Builder of local resources, capabilities, and relationships
– Contributor to, and active participant in, global strategy

The Functional Leader
– To develop worldwide processes and enhance worldwide learning 
– Scan for useful innovations in process, valuable information worldwide
– Cross-pollinate leading-edge knowledge and best practice
– Champion innovations that may offer transnational opportunities and applications

The Corporate Leader
– No single model for the global manager
– The Corporate Manager not only leads in the broadest sense; also identifies                 
and develops talented business, country, and functional managers – and                 
balances the negotiations among the three

Regional/Global Business Leader
Visioning

• Win-win from global reach

Sensemaking

• Global possibilities
• Local capabilities, 
and interests

Relating

• Cross-border “brokerage, 
alignment,
cajoling

Inventing

• Business models, architecture
that “travels” yet has many “owners”

The Country Leader
Visioning

Sensemaking

•Local ops, threats
•Local identity, drivers

•Core role of country in global/ regional 
enterprise
•Identity with country and  global / regional firm

Relating

• Government, local stakeholders
•Everyone in local “family”,
• Horizontal (other country) 
counterparts 
• Key Vertical interactions

Inventing

• Rats ops (out), platform ops (in)

The Functional Leader
Visioning

• Value thru functional excellence

Sensemaking

• State of the art, 
• hot spots within firm

Relating

• Champion of all 
members of “bench”
• Cross-pollinate
• Develop

Inventing

• Innovations that pass RATs
• Platforms
•Communities

Crossing Boundaries and the SLM

• Location-specific skills and knowledge, networks: for example --
– Knowledge of business culture of a specific industry in a 
specific country (Sensemaking)
– Networking skills within country (Relating)
• Border-crossing skills and knowledge: for example --
– Knowledge of how to learn quickly in new contexts 
(Sensemaking)
– Knowledge of how capabilities are/should be distributed 
across locations, networks across those locations 
(Sensemaking, visioning)
– Knowledge/skills in linking complementary capabilities 
(inventing, relating)
– Common sense re which must be standard, which can vary
– (Sensemaking, inventing)
– Knowledge of how to “translate” company vision/strategy into 
compelling local vision (visioning)

Developing Global Managers

• Recruitment – positive discrimination for international experience, 
interests
• Cross-border experience (short-term visits, short-term transfers, 
long-term postings)
• Training (training programs rotated around locations, including 
participants from multiple locations and roles)
• Cross-training: Rotation across positions, recognizing and building 
on personal networks (e.g. the engineer who understands a 
particular foreign customer and has networks into customer’s 
organization gets formal responsibility for relationship)
• $$ regardless of national origin
• Chance at top grades regardless of national origin

• Don’t confuse origin with international focus
