What do you do where?

• Full value chain R&D, Market sensing, product development, core 
man, assembly, marketing (branding, messaging), sales and service
• Deep “front end”
– Market sensing, product development, assembly (?), marketing 
(branding, messaging), sales and service
• Shallow front end
– marketing (branding, messaging)?, sales and service
• Deep “back end”
– R&D, product development, core man, assembly
• Shallow back end
– discrete components, products

Concept of “tapping” into advantaged 
locations

• Efficient production platforms – cost arbitrage

• “Hot spots” – sources of innovation – “you have to be there!”

But what activitieshave to be there?

• Offshore assembly
• Scouts/satellites (picking up knowledge and sending it back to 
“base station”)
• Knowledge creating unit (e.g. R&D center)
• Business HQ
• Entire value chain
• Plant/platform

It’s not just about labor cost
Companies that outsource production or services to low cost countries should focus 
on the best value rather than just the cost of labor.  Countries that have clusters of 
related industries can provide improvements along the value chain creating a higher 
value to the company that it outsourcing than those that focus on the cost of one 
element of the value chain alone.  This is very important with products that have high 
quality standards or require specific raw materials.  Bill Harrison

P&W—Why Singapore

•

•

Market similarity -- S Singapore Airlines is a demanding customer.  Given the globally competitive nature of the 
airline industry, there are many market similarities between P&W GSP's business in Singapore and its customers 
in other countries.
National Advantage--Having a leading global airline was a natural draw of Singapore. In addition, the highly-
skilled and productive labor with a strong work ethic makes the total landed cost of the Singapore worker very 
competitive, even when compared with Chinese workers who receive low salaries. SVP Jim Keenan also 
remarked that the workforce in Singapore has embraced lean manufacturing principles that has even offset 
higher wages than in other parts of the world.
Scale Economies -- Very capital and skills-intensive business. Once a location has shown that it is able to shine 
… companies …often re-invest to continue to upgrade the operations and reap economies of scale. 
Global Regimes / National Regulation -- Since Singapore is a small country, …(it largely) follows the regulations of 
the Federal Aviation Administration of the U.S. and the same agencies for Europe and Japan. This helps P&W to 
easily operate in Singapore and abide by the international regulations that govern this business. In addition, the 
Singapore government has continuously strengthened its pro-business environment to be supportive of foreign 
investors.
To further quote P&W's SVP Jim Keenan, "Nowhere have we found an employee base that takes ownership for 
continuous improvement more so than in Singapore. An optimal cost structure does not include only low wage 
rates. It also includes efficiency, and it includes relationships between government and business that make a 
country an easy place to do business. I would rate Singapore at the top of the list for being effective in 
strengthening all those areas."

As a result, Singapore has become very much like Pratt & Whitney's Hartford-of-the East (Hartford, CT is P&W's 
Global Headquarters). From its sister home-base in Singapore, Pratt & Whitney is able to enjoy arbitrage due to 
location-advantages from several sources, as explained above, as it competes in the aircraft engine repair market.

EPIX Pharmaceuticals

•

EPIX Pharmaceuticals maintains two laboratories.  One is in Lexington, MA; the other 
in Ramat Gan, Israel.  The technology to discover new drugs using computer models 
of protein-receptors and chemicals was developed at Tel Aviv University, and it is the 
first step in EPIX’s R&D process.  Rather than try to transplant the technology to the 
US, the computer modeling ("computational chemistry") lab was maintained in Israel, 
and tightly integrated with the medicinal chemistry and biology groups in Lexington 
with IT systems. The site is a key part of the EPIX value chain, which ends with 
intellectual property that is licensed to large pharmaceutical companies.  In the 
context of EPIX, it is a lead unit that is integral to product development.

How They Do It at Cisco
Outsourcing in Cisco, Boxborough MA is done in 2 ways:
1. Contracting fixed price work agreements with a small number of prescreened firms from India 
such as Wipro, TCS etc.
2. Moving engineering work to Cisco branch office in Bangalore, India.
Typically ongoing maintenance agreements (bug fixing, new releases with minor feature 
modifications) are handed out to Wipro etc whereas new development efforts are moved to the 
Bangalore branch office.
Some skills are easier to find in India - such as Web based development etc. while some others 
such as kernel development are hard to find so the skills required often form the basis for these 
outsourcing decisions.
• While at the Cisco Security Agent team, I also witnessed an Indian team being put together from 
scratch. It all started off with a VP of Engineering (of Indian origin) who decided to move back to 
India. He gradually put together a team in the Bangalore office and brought them up to speed 
over a period of 1 year, allowing them to fix bugs in the core product. Another year later, when a 
Linux version of the product was needed, this team had enough skills and proven expertise 
(gained from maintenance activities) to undertake this task. This team in Cisco, Bangalore 
appears to have been established as a "contributor" and then grown into a "source". Much 
grooming and leadership has gone into making this team competent and skilled. Now the team 
reports to a manager here at Boxborough, MA and continues to independently manage the Linux 
migration effort.

Today, the majority of GE's businesses world-wide have a presence in India — aircraft engines, 
broadcasting, capital services, lighting, medical systems, industrial systems, plastics, power 
systems and transportation systems — either through a joint venture, a wholly-owned subsidiary, 
a strategic alliance or a business development and customer support presence. 
India businesses help drive GE’s four corporate  initiatives — globalization, services, six sigma 
quality and e-business. GE has experienced success in sourcing products, services and intellectual 
talent from India for global businesses: 
GE pioneered the concept of software sourcing from India through Offshore Development Centres 
across the country, which now account for approximately 5% of India’s software exports. 
(Offshore>>Source and Lead)
The John F. Welch Technology Center is India’s first and largest industry multi-disciplinary 
research centre. This strategic investment by GE will provide critical technology, research and 
development for GE’s diverse global businesses.
• Medical Systems, Motors and Lighting supply finished products to the global GE system. 
(Source)
Power Systems, Industrial Systems and Appliances source parts and components from suppliers 
for use in operations outside India. (Offshore)
• Medical Systems, Appliances, Aircraft Engines, Industrial Systems, Power Systems and 
Transportation Systems develop and provide design and engineering services, and analysis for GE 
global businesses. (Source)
GE Capital Services caters to the diverse needs of a global business through its outsourcing 
services which include transaction processing, finance and accounting services, call center 
services, customer fulfillment activities and processes, data modeling and analytics support, 
managed IT services, software solutions and e-learning. (Offshore)

Questions for ICICI

• Should ICICI “Go International” or should it focus on the 
retail business in India? Why?
• Which customers /products / countries should ICICI 
focus on?
• Which capabilities are common to these different 
international thrusts, which differ? Which countries 
represent the best bases for these “capabilities 
platforms”?
• What mode of entry (direct, jv, license, white label) 
should ICICI follow in its international expansion?
• How can ICICI best match its capabilities and its 
international business model?
