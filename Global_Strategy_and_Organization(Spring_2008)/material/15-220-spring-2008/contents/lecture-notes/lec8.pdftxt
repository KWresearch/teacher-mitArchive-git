Response to Lever Skip

• How should P & G  respond to the Lever Skip Micro initiative in 
France?
• To what extent does your proposed response challenge the Euro-
branding approach?

Stay the course

P & G should launch the product as planned while carefully watching the 
Lever Skip Micro initiative. (Mirza Ahmed, Barry Bunn, Masahide Kawakami, Hyunyoung Kim)
 

…Lever’s product quality is not as good as P&G, thus P&G should avoid 
direct comparability to Lever’s product with either package size or price.

Based on this approach, P&G should launch Ariel Ultra in two sizes, 
… P&G should focus marketing differentiation based on environmentally 
friendly formulation and the ability to get substantially more wash loads 
... Pricing should remain at a slight premium as compared to the Lever 
product.  Country specific adjustment off of the regional base price would 
be at the discretion of the local marketing team.

Future launches should occur in a more simultaneous mode.
Waltz, Masaaki Yajima, Hidenobu Mukai)

Underlying Questions for P&G Case

• What are the benefits of a (unified) pan-European 
product/brand?
• What are the drawbacks?
• Which elements of the product/brand benefit most from 
a Pan-European approach, which least?

How integrated is European Market?
We will utilize the CAGE framework
Cultural Sensitivity: Environmental 
considerations were the primary issues driven 
by culture..
Administrative Sensitivity: Organizational 
structure measures and incentivizes GM by the 
profits of their local country sales. 
Geographic Sensitivity: The European 
strategy of marketing a consistent product 
across all local markets ignores the local 
product needs and preferences of each 
country. Levels of phosphate, perfume, 
packaging size, and other product attributes 
need to be tailored to each local market.
Economic Sensitivity: The willingness to pay 
in each country is different. P&G strategy of a 
consistent premium of 15% above their 
standard brand price allows for flexible pricing 
for each country. 
The pan-European initiative attempts to 
commoditize the product. The one size fits all 
argument does not make sense here.    
(Dawood Mohammed Al-Dawood, Mikko Uusitalo, and Mark Gustafson)

Application of the Lessard radar chart 
reveals:
1.
A desire by P&G management to take 
advantage of scale/scope – though these 
synergies are not quantified
2.
Significant differences in local 
country regulations (e.g. 4 France has no 
anti-phosphate laws, West Germany does)
3.
Significant differences in local 
markets (e.g. significant differences in 
wash temperatures, powder/liquid balance, 
package size preference)
4.
Some question about comparative 
advantage (How much better are the P&G 
brands in France vs. Lever when the 
market shares are within 3 percentage 
points of one another). 
…relatively small area of the radar 
chart

More “coordination”

In the future releases of the Ariel Ultra or other 
products should be better coordinated between 
counties to reduce the time between releases.
.. 
After this incident with Ariel Ultra, the GMs should see 
the benefit of cooperating to release the product on a 
tight schedule since they will be significantly affected 
by the reaction and increase in work needed to 
repackage the release.
(Justine Li, Rohit Kashyap, Steven James Martin, and Virgil Chan) 

More “adaptation”

P&G should adjust its European 
brand strategy and allow local 
adoptions in its marketing mix. The 
European brand building strategy is 
lacking the local adaptation 
required to achieve market 
leadership and is out performed by 
its competition. 
(Wang Tien-Chen, Joerg Hermann Walter 
Sommer, Ravshan Djeyenbekov, Soo Jin Chun) 

..should understand what functions can 
be centralized and what cannot be. Core 
competitive activities such as research 
and development, product formulation, 
and competitive positioning should be 
made in a more centralized mode. Market 
specific activities such as product 
package sizing and pricing, should be 
made in a country by country basis to 
adjust for specific customer’s behavior, 
competitive situation, and distribution 
structure. (Brent Waltz, Masaaki Yajima, 
Hidenobu Mukai)

Process

We believe that P&G did not manage well the Ariel Ultra 
innovation process because it did not understand the difference 
between regional integration and national responsiveness. The 
project leaders (Meyer and Mancel) were committed to a 
personal agenda of proving the new Euro-brand organization by 
rolling out a single formulation, packsize range and pricing across 
the whole Europe. 'Integration' seemed a noble idea, but poorly-
served in the marketing function with a one size fits all approach 
which blindly ignored relevant local consumer differences. 
Their  beliefs were challenged when Unilever launched Skip Micro 
in France, a country which Meyer was also responsible for… (Amy 
Schumacher, Clara Pombo, Teck Heng, Luis Prata)

We were are all uncomfortable with the internally focused nature of this 
discussion (e.g. one product formula = more leverage/lower costs vs. our 
customers will be trying to wash this way in the future, here are some ways 
we might help our customers to that). We didn’t like the lack of customer-
focus in these discussions and we were disappointed with what we view as a 
repeated and limited understanding of the power structure of the firm (e.g. 
Sub GM’s were powerful, less involved, and motivated to avoid 
risk). Determine what customer problem needs to be solved, then 
organize about solving that problem – which we admit is a messy 
problem .. (Devon Kinkead, Juan Carlos Munoz, Toshi Kajino, Shuey (Shuichi) 
Yokoyama, Fernando Diarte)

Euro Segmentation
• How do you get a customer focused discussion that does not 
automatically segment by country?
• Dimensions
– Green
– Urban vs Hyper
– Price vs. performance

• Conversion vs. Flanker

– Flanker strategy with 2 (even 3) sizes of Ariel Ultra, existing 
sizes (perhaps trimmed) of Ariel
– Can fully convert in some places

• Need to have regional level incentives to get there

P & G Evolution

• 1948: Overseas Division most value added at home, most 
direction from home, most innovation home for home (profits by 
country) (Europe, LA)
• 1950’s-60’s: Replicating Multi-domestic value-added localized, 
local org’s and  processes “copy-exact” (profits by country) (Asia)
• 1980’s: Redundant Multi-Domestic value-added deeply 
localized, many redundant activities, limited diffusion (profits by 
country)
• Mid-1980’s Regional coordination of functions, brands (profits 
by country)
• 1989 Global Category Executives for strategy, technology, 
product development (profit by countries)
• Mid 1990s – frustration, slowdown in innovation, slow diffusion, 
limited adoption of “outside” ideas.
• 2005: GBUs on top (including profit responsibility), MDOs to 
implement, functions in GBS.
• 2006 – back to the future

Written Assignment # 2: Due March 10
• Using one or more of the frameworks presented in class, discuss how your 
firm (or a firm of your choice) is organized in a particular country/region in order to 
exploit or enhance its core (often home-based) competencies  (RATs description in 
CEMEX article may be useful here).

– Focus on a single business and a single country or region other than the home base. 
– Describe the whether the country in question is a global/ regional platform, or a local 
market or source for the firm. (Ferdows' classification may be useful here)
– Briefly assess the contribution to the firm's global (regional) 
competitiveness of the conditions (Porter-'s resource diamond or my 
extended virtual diamond) of the country/region in question. (this may repeat part of 
your analysis in Paper # 1)
– Describe the nature and degree of global integration and local responsiveness/ 
embeddedness of (the focal unit of) your firm, using the Bartlett-Ghoshal global 
integration-localization chart (or another framework that fits the situation better).

•

To put in context, you might "map" a series of businesses in first I-R grid, 
but only "explode" one. Do the same with activities and regions. If possible, 
provide some historical context and compare and contrast the
integration and localization of this unit with other units of the firm and/or
competitors.
