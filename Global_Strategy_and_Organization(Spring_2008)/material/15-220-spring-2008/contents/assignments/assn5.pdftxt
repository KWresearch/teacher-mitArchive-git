CASE: American Outsourcing, HBS 9-705-037 

QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION: 

•  The Outsourcing “case” is more of a note than a case, so our discussion will focus on examples 
provided by class members  of "global sourcing platforms", i.e. operations located away from 
headquarters that manufacture (and possibly perform other services) for other regions. 
1)  Using an example from your own firm: 
– 
 Describe the operation including its product/geographical focus,  
– 
 whether it does product development as well,  
– 
 whether it is responsible for its local/regional market as well,  
–  how it fits into overall organization, e.g. part of global business unit, country unit, etc. 
1)  Using Ferdows’ terminology, is it an offshore source, and outpost, a server, a source, a lead, or a 
contributor? 
2)  How does this role relate to the “diamond” for the country and for the concepts of arbitrage as 
outlined by Ghemawat?
