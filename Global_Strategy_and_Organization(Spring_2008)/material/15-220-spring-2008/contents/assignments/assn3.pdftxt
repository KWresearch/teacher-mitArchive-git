CASE:  Shimano Inc. A and B, MIT Sloan Courseware (B to be distributed in class) 
 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION: 
 

1.  How has Shimano's business model changed over time? (e.g. early emergence in 1920's, 
regional expansions in 1930's, reestablishment in 1950's, international expansions in 
1960's, response to emergence of road racing in Europe, response to emergence of 
mountain biking in U.S.)? 
2.  How has this reflected the changing advantages conveyed by its Japanese home base? By 
other countries and regions? 
1.  At present (Case B), what steps should Shimano take to improve its competitive position?  
Should it, for example, develop additional functions in North America (besides sales and 
service) as it has in Asia and in Europe?  Why or why not?
