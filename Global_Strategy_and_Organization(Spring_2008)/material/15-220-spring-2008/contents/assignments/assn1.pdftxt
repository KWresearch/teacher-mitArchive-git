CASE:  Can Bollywood Go Global? HBS 9-806-040  
 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION in class (and for group posting to blog/forum) 
 

1)  Thinking about a Bollywood movie you have seen, what was it target audience? Would 
this movie have broad appeal to an American audience?  Why or why not? If the movie 
was changed to speak to American audience, do you think it would still appeal to an 
Indian audience?  Can a movie appeal to both successfully?  

2)  What is the best strategy for Bollywood to go global?  Should they pursue a niche market 
of global Indian Diaspora?  Or should they try to reach a non-Indian audience?  What 
kind of relationships should Indian filmmakers build with Hollywood movie industry?          

3)  For Hollywood, does Bollywood represent a competitive threat?  What kind of 
opportunities does Bollywood present for American filmmakers?  How should American 
filmmakers respond to Bollywood’s attempts to go global?     

4)  Based on your analysis of the global movie industry, is the world flat or not?  What are 
the key factors you would consider in determining how global an industry is or should 
be?
