LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

2.  Relate Global Leadership to Sloan Leadership Model 
3.  Understand relationship between changing strategy, organization, and managerial roles. 
4.  Identify and “try on” future roles for yourself.

Harvard Business Review. 
2.  Carlos Ghosn, “Saving the Business without Losing the Company,” Harvard

QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
 

1.  Describe and evaluate Ghosn’s key acts of leadership in the Nissan turnaround in terms 
of the Sloan Leadership Model (sensemaking, visioning, relating, inventing). 
2.  To what extent do these behaviors correspond to Bartlett and Ghoshal's global leadership 
categories (global leader, country leader, functional leader)? 
3.  What leadership elements most saliently reflect the global/international nature of the 
Ghosn’s intervention? 
4.  What benefit is Ghosn seeking for Nissan from the alliance with Renault? 
5.  How is he doing this? If possible, please describe in terms of “global integration” and 
“local responsiveness/ embeddedness.” 

6.  Think about other Sloan Fellows in visible global leadership positions and relate their 
challenges and actions to the SLM. Think about your own Global Leadership position 
and style when you return to the “real world.”
