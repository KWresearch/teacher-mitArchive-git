QUESTIONS FOR DICUSSION: 

1.  Based on your analysis of the software industry, why was InterSoft under pressure to internationalize?  
(Exploit vs enhance?) 

2.  What made the acquisition of Orgland appealing to InterSoft?   Is it essentially (wage) arbitrage, or is 
InterSoft seeking complementary capabilities that enhance its overall competiveness (virtual diamond)? 
Using Ferdows' framework, what role did InterSoft expected Orgland to play?   

3.  What went wrong and how could it have been prevented?  Was the problem that technological 
complexity (see Santos et. al.) or inadequate management?  Do you think that investing in IT tools for 
managing virtual teams (see Mijchrzak et. al) could alleviate some of these problems? 

4.  Using an example from your own experience of managing or working in a geographically-dispersed 
team, describe: 

•  Organization of the team including its geographical distribution  
•  Local capabilities accessed through a geographically dispersed team 
•  Mechanisms and technologies for coordination of team’s effort 
•  How did complexity of knowledge influenced your team’s ability to achieve its goals
