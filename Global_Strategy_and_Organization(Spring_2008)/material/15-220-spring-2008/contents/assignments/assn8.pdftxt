CLASS 8:  MANAGING INTEGRATION AND RESPONSIVESS  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:  
 

1.  Understand the concepts of global integration and local responsiveness/ 
embeddedness as separate dimensions rather than two extremes of a continuum 
2.  Determine “ideal” combination (rational design) for a given business situation. 
3.  Understand organizational (cultural and political) dynamics and the resulting 
tradeoffs associated with alternative choices re integration and responsiveness 
4.  Apply understanding to identify “sweet spot” for specific activities in a specific 
business context. 
5.  Consider multiple mechanisms for reaching these “sweet-spots,” e.g. formal 
organization, incentives, communication/information, systems and processes, 
selection/development of people.
