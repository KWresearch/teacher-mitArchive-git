CLASS 2:  LINKING NATIONAL AND FIRM-LEVEL ADVANTAGE  
 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
 

1.  Understand elements of “home base“advantage for firms competing internationally. 
2.  Understand relation between comparative advantage (based on country characteristics) 
and competitive advantage (based on firm-level configuration and competencies). 

 
READINGS: 
 

1.  Michael Porter, “Competing Across Locations: Enhancing Competitive Advantage 
through a Global Strategy” from Porter, On Competition, 1998. 
2.  Marian Beise, “Lead markets: country-specific drivers of the global diffusion of 
innovations,” Research Policy, 33 (2004) 997–1018. 
 
CASE:  Finland and Nokia HBS 9-702-427 
 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION (based on the case and article): 
 

1.  What were the primary characteristics of Finland that allowed Nokia to build a global 
leadership position in mobile phones?  Which ones of these were the result of explicit 
policy choices? 
2.  To what extent were these advantages unique to Finland, compared to Germany or other 
countries in Western Europe, the U.S. or Japan? 
3.  To what extent did Nokia “reach beyond” these “home base” characteristics in 
establishing its leading position? 
4.  Do you think the same cycle of establishing advantage (and the associated business 
model) in an advanced country and diffusing it to other markets (including emerging 
markets) is still relevant in this industry? Why or why not?
