Written Assignment # 2: Due Monday March 10, 2008 
 
Focusing on one country or region other than its home base where your firm (or the firm 
of your choice) has significant operations, answer the following three questions, making 
use of the relevant frameworks from class: 
  
a) why has the firm “internationalized” into that particular location (RATs and 
platforms, virtual diamond, and/or arbitrage/agglomeration/adaptation),  
b) what role does that unit play in the overall firm (source, contributor, etc) and,  
c) how are those activities integrated globally and embedded locally (I-R 
framework)? 
 
You may focus on a potential foreign location instead of an actual one, answering the 
same questions.
