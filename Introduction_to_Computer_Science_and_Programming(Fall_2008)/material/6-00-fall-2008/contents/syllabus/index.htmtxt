***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session
***** Prerequisites *****
This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience.
***** Goals *****
This subject has several related goals:
    * Provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving
      problems.
    * Help students, including those who do not necessarily plan to major in
      Course VI, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small
      programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
    * Position students so that they can compete for UROPs and excel in
      subjects such as 6.01.
***** Textbook *****
A textbook for 6.00 is now available. The book and the course lectures parallel
each other, though there is more detail in the book about some topics. The book
is NOT required. We will not be referring to it in assignments or depending
upon it to cover holes in the lectures.
[mp_logo.gif] [Amazon_logo] Guttag, John. Introduction_to_Computation_and
Programming_Using_Python. MIT Press, 2013. ISBN: 9780262519632.
If you choose not to purchase this book, you will probably find it useful to
buy or borrow another book that covers Python. You might check your local
public library's resources, or search online for a free Python text, such as
How_to_Think_Like_a_Computer_Scientist or An_Introduction_to_Python.
***** Lecture and Recitation Attendance *****
A significant portion of the material for this course will be presented only in
lecture, so students are expected to regularly attend lectures.
Recitations give students a chance to ask questions about the lecture material
or the problem set for the given week. Sometimes, new material may be covered
in recitation. Recitation attendance is encouraged but not required, though
attendance and participation may be taken into account in the case of grades on
letter borderlines. Please attend the recitation to which you were assigned, if
possible.
***** Homeworks and Quizzes *****
Each problem set will involve programming in Python. Students will make
extensive use of libraries, so that it will be possible to write programs that
solve real problems. There will be three quizzes: two during the semester,
administered in evenings, and one during the final exam time-slot.
***** Collaboration Policy *****
**** Problem Sets ****
Our policy is simple: unless otherwise noted in the assignment itself, feel
free to collaborate with each other on all the individual problem sets, but
note with whom you collaborated. Portions of some of the problem sets may have
been used in previous terms; please do not look at old solutions or course
"bibles." Collaboration with non-team members in team problem sets is not
allowed. The assignments are intended to help you understand the material. Know
the code and be prepared for occasional individual code reviews. During these
reviews we may ask you to make modifications to your code while we watch.
   1. Our first concern is for what the students in the class learn. We assume
      that everyone in the class is here because they want to learn, and will
      behave in a manner consistent with that goal.
   2. Working with other students on problem sets often enhances the learning
      process. That is why we have a relatively liberal collaboration process.
      Getting honest evaluations and critiques of your work is also part of the
      learning process. That is one of the reasons we want you to submit your
      work individually, and why it is important that the work you submit is
      truly yours.
   3. Collaborative learning works best when the students working together have
      roughly the same level of knowledge and skill. Each participant in the
      collaboration should contribute more or less equally to solving the
      problem. When one student is consistently showing another how to do
      things, it is not a true collaboration. When one student bases their
      solution on the completed work of another, it is certainly not a
      collaboration.
   4. We are certainly not opposed to students who understand things helping
      out those who don't, but that is not the same as collaboration. Also, it
      is important to understand the difference between helping someone to
      learn something, and helping them to get a problem set done. The former
      can be accomplished by explaining how some feature of Python or how some
      algorithm works. The latter can be accomplished by providing a solution
      to the problem set. That is not permitted by our collaboration policy.
**** Quizzes ****
You should not collaborate on quizzes.
***** Grading Policy *****
Grades will be roughly computed as follows:
   Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES   PERCENTAGES
Problem sets 55%
Quiz 1       10%
Quiz 2       15%
Quiz 3       20%
Â 
Over the course of the term, students will have two "late days" that they can
use on problem sets. Any additional late work beyond these two late days will
not be accepted, unless an extension has been approved by the professors.
