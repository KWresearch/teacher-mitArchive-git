Dear 6.00 students, 
 
Here is the code that we promised to post prior to the quiz. Please study it carefully 
and make sure that you understand it, since many of the questions on the quiz will 
refer to it. I suggest that you start by running it and understanding its output. You 
might then want to experiment with various different parameter settings to get a 
sense of why it behaves the way it does. And of course, read the code. 
 
If you have questions, the TA's will be glad to help you during the quiz reviews.
