Problem  1 

2.  Given an  integer or a string representation of an  integer, f returns the sum 
of  its  digits. 

1.  False.  Recursion means  your  program  can  run  indeﬁnitely. 
2.  False.  You  may  end  up  jumping  back  and  forth  between  the  same  two  Problem  4 
forever,  given  an  S-shaped  function  (draw  a  diagram). 

3.  False.  mydict[somekey]  =  somevalue.	

4.  False.  Precision  is  ﬁnite.	

5.  False.  Recursion  may  be  a  more  natural  way  to  express  certain  problems	
(e.g.:  ﬁb,  Towers  of  Hanoi).	

6.  True.  Code  reuse.	

7.  True.  A  quick  lookup.	

Problem  2 

1.  Yes, they return the same value for all possible inputs (at least of the types 
that  we’ve  learned  about  so  far  in  class). 

2.  No,  they print diﬀerent  things  for negative  inputs.  This  is because a and b 
are  updated  to  refer  to  a  diﬀerent  number  in  compare1,  whereas  they  are 
not  updated  in  compare2. 

Problem  3 

def  first_N(n): 
count  =  0 
current_sqrt  =  1 
while  count  <  n: 
square  =  current_sqrt  *  current_sqrt

#  If  square  is  not  even

if  square  %  2  !=  0: 
print  square 
count  +=  1 
current_sqrt  +=  1 

Problem  5 

def  guess_and_check(criteria): 
for  a  in  range(...): 
for  b  in  range(...): 
for  c  in  range(...): 
... 
if  satisfies_criteria(a,  b,  c,  ...,  criteria): 
return  a,  b,  c,... 

Note  about  this  function:  it  is  a  bit  strange  in  that  it  handles multiple  argu­
ment  types. 

Problem  6 

1.  f(2112)  returns  2+1+f(’12’)  ==>  2+1+1+2  ==>  6.	

def  findSide(): 

1 

area  =  float(  raw_input(’Enter  the  area  of  the  rectangle:  ’)  )

side1  =  float(  raw_input(’Enter  the  length  of  one  side  of  the  rectangle:  ’)  )

return  area  /  side1


Problem  7 

Yes,  it meets  its  speciﬁcation,  because  the  list  being modiﬁed  is  a  brand-new 
list  (result)  that  is  created  inside  the  function,  then  returned.  L  is  only 
traversed. 

Problem  8 

Note  the  resemblance  to  the  exhaustive  enumeration  for  guess-and-check,  in 
Problem  5. 
We’re  assuming  that  by  “decides,”  we  just  need  to  return  True/False. 

def  nuggets(num): 
for  a  in  range(num/6+1): 
for  b  in  range(num/9+1): 
for  c  in  range(num/20+1): 
if  6*a  +  9*b  +  20*c  ==  num: 
return  True 
return  False 

Problem  9 

Given an  integer,  take the string representation of that  integer and reverse  its 
digits  (returning  this  as  a  string).
