Many of the problem sets focus on specific topics, such as virus population
dynamics, word games, protein sequences, or simulating the movement of a
Roomba. (Roomba photograph courtesy of Stephanie_Booth on Flickr; virus image

***** Course Description *****
This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It
aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play
in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their major,
to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that
allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Pythonâ¢
programming language.
***** OCW Scholar Version *****
