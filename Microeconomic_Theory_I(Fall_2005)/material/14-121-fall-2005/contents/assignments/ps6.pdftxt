14.121  Problem  Set #6

General  instructions:  Use  the  comparative  statics  theorems  from  class  where  possible.  If  a 
question  refers  implicitly  to a  set of optimizers  then you may  simply give  results  that apply 
to  the  highest  element  of  the  set. 
1.  (a)  Let  g  :  � → � be  non­decreasing.  Show  that  if  f  :  �2  → � satisﬁes  increasing 
diﬀerences,  then so does the composite function h deﬁned by h(x, y) = f (g(x), y).  Interpret 
this  in  words.  Intuitively,  why  is  this  a  desirable  property  when  we  are  thinking  about 
comparative  statics? 
(b)  Let  h  : � → � be  twice  diﬀerentiable.  Prove  that  f (x, θ) = h(x − θ)  has  increasing 
diﬀerences  if  and  only  if  h  is  concave. 

2.  Let  Q(p, θ)  be  a  downward­sloping  demand  curve,  let  θ  be  a  parameter  of  the  demand 
curve,  and  suppose  that  Q  is  diﬀerentiable  in  p  and  strictly  positive  in  the  relevant  region 
of  prices.  (In  this  question  it  may  be  helpful  to  note  that  maximizing  a  strictly  positive 
function  f  is  equivalent  to maximizing  log(f ).) 
(a) Show  that Q becomes more  inelastic with θ  if and only  if  log(Q(p, θ)) has  increasing 
diﬀerences. 
(b)  Suppose  the  ﬁrm  solves  maxp (p − c)Q(p, θ).  Derive  a  suﬃcient  condition  for  p  to 
increase  (weakly)  with  θ  and  relate  your  answer  to  part  (a). 
(c)  It  is  often  assumed  that  the  demand  curve  is  concave  in  p,  in  order  to  validate  the 
approach based  on ﬁrst  order  conditions.  Show  that  concave demand  is  suﬃcient  to  ensure 
that  the  proﬁt  function  is  concave.  Can  you  give  an  economic  justiﬁcation  for  concave 
demand?  Is  this  necessary  for  the  comparative  statics  prediction? 

3.  Suppose  there  are  two  inputs  to  production,  technology  and  the  skill  level  of  a  single 
worker  who  uses  the  technology.  There  are  two  technologies  available  for  production,  one 
which  uses  computers  and  one which  uses  old­fashioned  technology.  If  the  ﬁrm  chooses  the 
computer  technology  its production  function  is G(s), while  the production  function  is H (s) 
if  it  uses  the  old­fashioned  technology.  The  total  cost  of  skill  is  c(s)  on  the market. 
(a)  What  are  suﬃcient  conditions  on  G  and  H  to  ensure  that  proﬁt­maximizing  ﬁrms 
who use the computer­driven technology buy more skill than ﬁrms who use the old­fashioned 
technology?  If  we  wish  the  result  to  hold  without  any  structure  on  c(s),  is  there  a  weaker 
condition  which  will  do?  (Hint:  Deﬁne  a  function  f (s, θ)  where  f (s, θH ) =  G(s)  and 
f (s, θL ) = H (s).) 
(b)  Suppose  that  the  cost  of  the  computer­driven  technology  falls  smoothly  over  time, 
starting  at  a  very  high  level  and  eventually  reaching  zero,  and  that  ﬁrms  choose  their 
technology  and  level  of  skill  at  the  same  time.  Assume  whatever  conditions  you  derived  in 
part  (a).  Do  we  expect  the  skill  level  selected  by  the  ﬁrms  to  change  smoothly?
