14.121  Problem  Set #2 
Due  September  28,  2005 

1.  Suppose  a  consumer  satisﬁes  the  von  Neumann­Morgenstern  axioms  and  is  (strictly) 
risk  averse.  She  initially  has monetary  wealth  w.  There  is  some  probability  p  that  she  will 
lose  an  amount  L.  The  consumer  can  purchase  insurance  that  will  pay  her  q  dollars  in  the 
event  that  she  incurs  this  loss.  The  amount  she  has  to  pay  for  this  insurance  is  πq ;  here  π 
is  the  premium  per  dollar  of  coverage. 

(a)  How  much  insurance  will  the  consumer  purchase?  That  is,  what  is  the  choice  of  q 
(as a function of the parameters w, p, L and π) that maximizes her expected utility?  (Note: 
It’s  ﬁne  to  just  give  an  equation  that  implicitly  deﬁnes  q .) 

(b) In the special case where the insurance is actuarial ly  fair  (that is, π = p), how much 
insurance  will  the  consumer  purchase?  What  about  if  π > p?  Discuss. 

2.  Consider a town somewhere not very far from MIT which is ﬁlled with utility­maximizing 
citizens, all of whom have preferences which satisfy the von Neumann­Morgenstern axioms, 
which  can  be  represented  by  a  utility  function  u(w),  where  the  function  u  is  the  same  for 
all agents.  Assume  that  this utility  function  is diﬀerentiable as many  times as you  like, and 
further  assume  it  is  strictly  increasing  and  concave. 
Every  individual  has  some  initial  wealth  as  well  as  a  car  which  must  be  parked  at 
metered  parking  spaces  each  day.  The  cost  of  the  meter  is  given  by  m.  If  the  meter  is 
not  paid,  it  indicates  “violation.”  The  town  hires  police  who  patrol  the  area,  and  with 
probability  p  the  violation  is  spotted  and  a  ﬁne  f  is  levied.  If  the  police  do  not  spot  the 
violation,  the  individual  pays  nothing. 
Consider  the  problem  faced  by  an  individual  who  maximizes  their  utility  for  the  day 
by  choosing  whether  or  not  to  feed  the  meter  (for  non­Americans,“feed”  is  slang  for  “put 
money  into”).  Let  Δ  denote  the  returns  to  the  agent  from  feeding  the  meter,  that  is,  the 
diﬀerence  between  the  agents  expected  utility  from  feeding  the  meter  and  their  expected 
utility  from  parking  illegally. 

(a)  Suppose  that  the  town  council  considers  funding  more  police,  which  increases  p, 
versus  raising  the  ﬁne  f .  Compute  the  elasticity  of  Δ  with  respect  to  p,  and  compare  it 
to  the  elasticity  of  Δ  with  respect  to  f .  To  which  policy  change  are  the  citizens  more 
responsive? 

(b) For the remainder of this problem suppose that citizens of this town diﬀer according 
to  their  initial  wealth,  w0 ,  on  the  range  [w,  ¯w].  Suppose  also  that  the  parameters  of  the 
problem  are  such  that  Δ  is  decreasing  in  initial  wealth,  and  that  we  observe  some  citizens 
feeding  the  meters  and  others  parking  illegally. 
Write  a  simple  expression  which  determines  which  group  of  people  feeds  meters  and 
which  group  parks  illegally.  Show  that  the  assumption  that  the  both  groups  are  nonempty 
requires  assuming  that  the  price  of  the  meter,  m,  is  larger  than  the  expected  value  of  the 
ﬁne,  pf ,  from  parking  illegally?

(c) Qualitatively,  how does  the  set  of people who  feed  the meters  change with  f , m  and 
p?  Prove  your  answer  and  interpret  your  results. 

3.  MWG  question  6.B.5 

4.  The  standard  ﬁnancial  advice  is  that  younger  people  should  invest  a  higher  fraction  of 
their wealth in stocks than older people.  Discuss why this might (or might not) make sense.
