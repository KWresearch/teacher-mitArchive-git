14.121  Problem  Set #4 
Due  October  12,  2005 

1.  A  consumer  has  a  continuous,  strictly  increasing,  quasi­concave  utility  function.  You 
p1 p2
u. 
know  that  the  consumer’s  expenditure  function  is  e(p1 , p2 , u) =  p1+p2 
(a)  Show  that  by  considering what  happens when  one  price  goes  to  inﬁnity  it  is  easy  to 
ﬁnd  u(x1 , 0)  and  u(0, x2 ). 

(b)  For  what  values  of  x1  does  there  exist  a  nonnegative  x2  such  that  u(x1 , x2 ) = u0? 

(c)  Let  x1  be  in  the  range  you  identiﬁed  in  part  (b).  By  ﬁxing  p1  =  1  and  considering 
what  happens  when  the  consumer  faces  prices  (1, p2 )  and  has  wealth  e(1, p2 , u0 )  you  can 
ﬁnd  a  set  of  values  of  x2  for which  u(x1 , x2 ) ≤ u0 .  What  do  you  know  about  the  largest  x2 
in  this  set?  Use  this  approach  to  describe  the  indiﬀerence  curve  u(x1 , x2 ) =  u0 ,  i.e.  ﬁnd 
the  function  x2 (x1 , u0 )  such  that  u(x1 , x2 (x1 , u0 )) = u0? 

(d)  Can  you  see  how  to  use  this  information  to  very  quickly  ﬁnd  u(x1 , x2 )?
