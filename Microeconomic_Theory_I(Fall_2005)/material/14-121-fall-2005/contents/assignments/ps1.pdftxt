14.121  Problem  Set #1 
Due  September  14,  2005 

1.  Let  P  be  a  preference  relation  on  a  set  X .  Assume  that  P  is  complete,  reﬂexive  and 
transitive.  Let  the  binary  relation �P  represent  P .  Deﬁne  two  new  binary  relations  on X , 
denoted  �P ,  by 

x ∼P  y  ⇔  (x �P  y) ∧ (y �P  x) ; 
x �P  y  ⇔  (x �P  y) ∧ ¬ (y �P  x) . 

Prove  the  following: 
1.	 ∼P  is  symmetric:  If  x ∼P  y  then  y ∼P  x. 
2.	 ∼P  is  reﬂexive:  x ∼P  x. 
3.	 ∼P  is  transitive:  If  x ∼P  y  and  y  ∼P  z  then  x ∼P  z .  Together,  the  ﬁrst  three  parts 
have  shown  that  ∼P  is  an  equivalence  relation. 
4.  Show  that  if  x �P  y  and  y �P  z  then  x �P  z . 

2.	 (MWG  Exercise  1.B.3)  Show  that  if  f  :  � → � is  a  strictly  increasing  function  and 
u	 :  X  → � is  a  utility  function  representing  preference  relation  �P ,  then  the  function 
v  :  X  →  � deﬁned  by  v(x) =  f (u(x))  (that  is,  v  =  f
◦
u)  is  also  a  utility  function 
representing  preference  relation  �P . 
3.  Let  �P  be  a  complete,  reﬂexive  and  transitive  preference  relation  on  X .  We  showed 
in  class  that  if  X  is  ﬁnite,  then  there  is  a  utility  function  u  that  represents  �P .  In  this 
question  we’ll  see  what  happens  when X  is  (uncountably)  inﬁnite. 
Suppose  X  is  �2  and  �P  is  deﬁned  by  (x1 , x2 ) �P  (y1 , y2 )  iﬀ  x1  >  y1  or  (x1  =  y1  and 
x2  ≥ y2 ).  These  preferences  are  called  lexicographic. 
(a)  Show  that �P  deﬁnes  a  complete,  reﬂexive  and  transitive  preference  relation  on X . 
(b)  Show  that  there  is  no  utility  function  u  :  X  → � that  represents  �P .  What  does 
this  mean  for  the  theorem  that  we  proved  in  class  (that  if  X  is  ﬁnite  and  �P  is  complete, 
reﬂexive  and  transitive,  then  there  is  a  utility  function  that  represents  �P )? 
(c)  Theorem  1.1  in  the  Jehle­Reny  book  shows  that  if  X  =  �n  and  �P  is  a  complete, 
reﬂexive,  transitive  preference  relation  on  X  satisfying  two  additional  axioms  (continuity 
and  strict monotonicity),  then  �P  can  be  represented  by  a  utility  function. 
Which  of  these  properties  are  violated  by  lexicographic  preferences? 

4.  The  paper  on  the  reading  list  by  Carson,  Wilks,  and  Imber  attempts  to  place  a  dollar 
value  on  the  preservation  of  the Kakadu  Conservation  Zone  by  surveying  2034  Australians 
about  their  preferences.  They  ﬁnd  that  the  beneﬁts  of  the  pro ject  greatly  outweigh  the 
costs.

A  critique  of  this  methodology  (found  in  the  Diamond­Hausman  paper  among  other 
places)  is  that  the  survey  responses  do  not  accurately  reﬂect  people’s  true  preferences. 
There  is  no  reason  to  lie  in  response  to  a  survey,  but  people  might  misrepresent  their 
preferences  for  any  of  several  reasons:  they  have  had  little  time  to  think  about  the  issue 
and  don’t  know  their  preferences  well;  they  may  worry  about  what  the  interviewer  would 
think  about  the  true  preferences;  or  they  may  derive  utility  from  thinking  that  they  are  a 
virtuous  person  who  would  contribute  to  the  public  good  if  asked. 
It’s not necessary  to  read  though  the papers, but at  least  try  to  skim  through  them and 
then  try  to  see  if you can use  the material  from  this class  to help  think about how we could 
assess whether the survey results seem  like true preferences over the Kakadu.  What axioms 
for  preferences  might  be  violated  by  the  survey  results?  How  might  one  design  a  better 
survey  to  look  for  such  violations?  What  do  you  think  we  should  do  if  we  ﬁnd  violations?
