1.  MWG  Exercise  3.I.2  (page  86). 
2.  Goods  i  and  j  are  said  to  be  “substitutes”  (at  (p, u))  if  ∂hi (p, u) ≥ 0.
∂ pj 
(a)  If  goods  i  and  j  are  substitutes  at  (p, u)  is  it  always  the  case  that  goods  j  and  i  are 
substitutes  at  (p, u)? 
(b)  Give  an  example  of  two  goods  for  which  it  is  plausible  to  think  that  they  would  be 
substitutes  for  a  consumer  at  one  price  and  not  substitutes  at  another  price. 
(c)  By  considering  what  happens  when  the  price  of  good  i  increases  (and  using  the 
symmetry  of  the  Slutsky matrix)  show  that  every  good  has  at  least  one  substitute. 
(d)  Assume  that  coﬀee  and  tea  are  substitutes  at  all  (p, u).  How  does  the  amount  a 
consumer will pay to avoid being deprived of tea altogether depend on whether or not coﬀee 
is  available?  Prove  your  answer.

3.  Consider  a  consumer  with  indirect  utility  function  v(p1 , p2 , I ) = I /
(a) What  is  the  consumer’s  expenditure  function? 
(b) What  are  the  consumer’s  Hicksian  demand  functions? 
(c)  Suppose  that  the  consumer  initially  has  I  =  400  and  the  prices  are  p1  =  p2  =  100. 
What  would  the  compensating  variation  be  if  p1  increases  to  400? 
(d)  Compute  Paasche  and  Laspeyres  price  indexes  for  this  price  change.  How  do  they 
compare  with  the  cost­of­living  adjustment  suggested  by  the  compensating  variation?

4.  Consider  a  monopolist  with  cost  function  c(q) =  cq .  Use  a  simple  revealed  preference 
argument  to  show  that  the monopolist’s output  is weakly decreasing  in  c.  (One  can do  this 
very  generally  without making  any  assumptions  about  the  demand  curve.)
