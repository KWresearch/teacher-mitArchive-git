14.121  Problem  Set #3 
Due  October  5,  2005 

1.  MWG  Exercise  3.D.5  parts  (a),  (c),  and  (d). 

2.  MWG  Exercise  3.G.6  parts  (a),  (b),  and  (c). 
3.  Let  the  consumption  set  be  (−∞, ∞) × �n−1 ,  and  suppose  that  preferences  are  strictly 
+ 
convex  and  quasi­linear  in  the  ﬁrst  good.  Normalize  p1  = 1. 

(a)  Show  tht  the  Marshallian  demand  functions  for  goods  2, . . . , n  are  independent  of 
wealth 

(b)  Show  that  the Hicksian  demand  functions  for  goods  2, . . . , n  are  independent  of  the 
target  utility. 

(c) Argue that the indirect utility function can be written in the form v(p, w) = w + φ(p) 
for  some  function  φ.  What  is  the  form  of  the  expenditure  function? 
4.  A  consumer  of  two  goods  has  utility  function  u(x, y) = max{ax, ay} + min{x, y},  with 
0 < a < 1. 

(a)  Draw  the  indiﬀerence  curves  for  these  preferences. 

(b)  Derive  the Marshallian  and  Hicksian  demands. 

5.  In  the  last  ﬁve  years  there  has  been  a  dramatic  increase  in  the  price  of  single­family 
homes  in  the  Boston  area.  There  has  been  only  a  small  increase  in  the  rents  charged  for 
single­family homes  that are oﬀered  for  rent.  Discuss how you would  think about modeling 
rental  housing  and  purchased  housing  in  a  family’s  utility  function.  What  type  of  utility 
function  might  be  appropriate?  How  might  one  account  for  the  change  in  relative  prices 
given  that  the  stock  of  single­family  houses  is  approximately  ﬁxed?
