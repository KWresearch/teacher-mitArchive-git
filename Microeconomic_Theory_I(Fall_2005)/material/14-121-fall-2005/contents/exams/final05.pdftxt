14.121  Final  Exam 
October  28,  2005 

Answer  all  questions.  You  have  90  minutes  in  which  to  complete  the  exam.  Don’t 
spend  too  much  time  on  any  one  question. 

1.  (15 Minutes  –  20  Points)  Answer  each  of  the  following  subquestions  BRIEFLY. 

(a)  Deﬁne  equivalent  variation  and  compensating  variation.  Given  an  example  of  a 
problem  for  which  equivalent  variation  would  be  an  appropriate  concept  to  apply. 
√

(b)  Find  the  Hicksian  demand  function  for  a  consumer  with  u(x1 , x2 ) = 

x1  + x2 . 

(c)  The  traditional  celebration  of  Thanksgiving  in  the  United  States  involves  families 
gathering  together  and  eating  a  large  meal  that  includes  a  whole  roasted  turkey.  The 
tradition  is  widely  followed:  over  95%  of  Thanksgiving  meals  include  a  turkey  and  twenty 
times  more  turkeys  are  sold  during  the  Thanksgiving  week  than  in  a  normal  week.  An 
initially puzzling  observation  is  that  supermarkets  typically put  turkeys  on  sale during  this 
week.  Why might  this  occur?

Suppose  that  Glenn  Ellison  is  considering  purchasing  ﬂood  insurance  for  his  house.  If 
Glenn  does  not  buy  ﬂood  insurance,  his  wealth  will  be  w  if  there  is  no  ﬂood  and  w − L  if 
there  is  a  ﬂood.  The  probability  of  a  ﬂood  is  π . 
The  price  of  a  policy  that  pays  K  if  a  ﬂood  occurs  is  cK .  Assume  that  c  <  1.  (Note 
that the problem is otherwise uninteresting because Glenn would never buy any insurance.) 
Assume that Glenn can choose any K  ∈ [0, L], and that his choice of how much insurance 
to  buy  maximizes  his  expected  utility.  Assume  that  Glenn’s  von  Neumann­Morgenstern 
utility  function  u  is  a  diﬀerentiable,  strictly  increasing  and  concave  function  of  his  ﬁnal 
wealth,  i.e.  Glenn maximizes  (1 − π)u(w − cK ) + πu(w − L − cK + K ). 
(a) Find  the ﬁrst­order condition  that characterizes Glenn’s choice of K  (assuming  that 
the  parameters  are  such  that  an  interior  optimum  exists.) 

(b)For  what  value(s)  of  c  will  Glenn  purchase  full  insurance?  Does  the  answer  depend 
on  the  form  of  the  utility  function  u?  Why  is  this? 

(c)  Drop  the  assumptions  that  u  is  diﬀerentiable  and  concave  –  assume  only  that  u  is 
strictly  increasing and that a utility­maximizing choice exists.  Show that the K  that Glenn 
chooses  is  weakly  increasing  in  the  probability  π  of  a  ﬂood  occurring.

Consider  an  economy  with  three  goods.  Suppose  that  a  consumer  has  a  continuous 
utility  function  satisfying  local  nonsatiation.  Suppose  also  that  the  consumer’s  Walrasian 
demands  for  goods  1  and  2  when  p3  = 1  satisfy 

x1 (p1 , p2 , 1, W ) =  a1  + b1p1  + c1p2  + d1p1p2 
x2 (p1 , p2 , 1, W ) =  a2  + b2p1  + c2p2  + d2p1p2 

(a)  State Walras’  law  and  use  it  to  ﬁnd  the Walrasian  demand  for  good  3.  (It’s  ﬁne  to 
just  give  the  demand  when  p3  = 1.) 

(b)  State  a  result  about  the  homogeneity  of  Walrasian  demands  and  use  it  to  ﬁnd  the 
consumer’s Walrasian  demands  at  other  values  of  p3 . 

(c) Note that the Walrasian demands for goods 1 and 2 are independent of wealth.  Show 
that  this  makes  it  very  easy  to  ﬁnd  the  Hicksian  demands  for  goods  1  and  2.  State  the 
Compensated  Law  of  Demand.  Show  that  this  law  puts  some  restrictions  on  the  possible 
values  for  (a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 , a2 , b2 , c2 , d2 ). 

(d)  Deﬁne  the  Slutsky  substitution  matrix.  What  properties  must  it  have  if  demands 
are  derived  from  maximizing  a  continuous,  locally  nonsatiated,  and  strictly  quasiconcave 
utility  function?  Give  at  least  one  additional  restriction  on  (a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 , a2 , b2 , c2 , d2 )  that 
this  implies.

Let  X  =  {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn}  be  a  ﬁnite  set  of  states.  Let  Δ(X )  be  the  set  of  lotteries  with 
outcomes  in  X .  Write  δxi  for  the  lottery  in  which  xi  is  realized  with  probability  one. 
�P 
�P  δx2 
Let �P  be a preference on Δ(X ).  Assume that �P  is transitive and that δx1 
. . . �P  δxn . 
(a)  State  the  Archimedian  axiom. 
(b) The preference �P  is  said  to  satisfy monotonicity  if aδx1  + (1 − a)δxn 
if  and  only  if  a ≥ b.  Show  that monotonicity  implies  that  δ
x1  �P 
δxn .
xn 
(c)  The  preference  �P  is  said  to  satisfy  continuity  if  for  all  x  ∈  Δ(X )  there  exists  an 
a  ∈  [0, 1]  such  that  aδ + (1 − a)δxn  ∼P  x.  Show  that  if  �P  satisﬁes  monotonicity  and 
x1 
continuity,  then  it  satisﬁes  the  Archimedian  axiom.
