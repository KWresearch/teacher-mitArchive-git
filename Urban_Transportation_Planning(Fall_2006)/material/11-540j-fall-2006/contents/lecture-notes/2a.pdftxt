Introduction from Meyer and Miller … 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

1.

5.	

The world moves into the future as a result of decisions (or
the lack of decisions), not as result of plans 

All decisions involve the evaluation of alternative images of 
the future, and the selection of the most highly valued of
feasible alternatives 

Evaluation and decisions are influenced by the degree of
uncertainty associated with expected consequences 

The products of planning should be designed to increase the
chance of making better decisions 

The result of planning is some form of communication with 
decision makers

Models and Forecasting… 

  Forecasting: 
  Short term 
extrapolation:The future on 
the basis of the past 
  Applicable to slow 
incremental change 
  We tend to believe that 
today’s status quo will 
continue for ever 
  We often ignore …

…And Scenarios 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

	 A conceptual description of the future based on 
cause and effect 
	 Invent and analyze several stories of equally 
plausible futures to bring forward surprises and 
unexpected leaps of understanding 
	 Goal is not to create a future, nor to choose the 
most probable one, but to make strategic 
decisions that will be sound (or robust) 
under all plausible futures

Scenarios 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

"Scenarios transform information into 
perceptions... It is a creative experience 
that generates an 'Aha!' ... and leads to 
strategic insights beyond the mind's 
previous reach." 

Pierre Wack  GBN

Reading on Scenarios 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

	 “The Art of the Long View” by Peter 
Schwartz 
	 “Scenarios: The Art of Strategic 
Conversation” by Kees van der Heijden 

Both authors work for the Global Business 
Network (www.gbn.com) and come from the 
Shell Planning Group

Scenarios: Why? 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

  History is a continuum of pattern breaks 
  We react to uncertainty through denial 
(that is why a quantitative model is so reassuring!) 
  Mental models, and myths, control what you do
and keep you from raising the rightquestions 
  We cannot predict the future with certainty 
  By providing alternative images of the future: 
  We go from facts into perceptions, and, 
  Open multiple perspectives 
	 Approach: Suspend disbelief in a story long
enough to appreciate its potential impact

Scenarios: How? 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

	 Examine the environment in which your 
actions will take place and see how those 
actions will fit in the prevailing forces, trends, 
attitudes and influences 
	 Identify driving forces and critical 
uncertainties 
	 Challenge prevailing mental modes and be 
creative about the future of critical variables 
	 Rehearse the implications

Scenarios: Stages 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

1. 

2. 

Identify focal issue or decision (ie Global warming) 
Identify driving forces in the local environment 
Identify driving forces in the macro environment 
3. 
4.  Rank the importance and uncertainty of each 
5.  Select scenario logics (so as to tell a story) 
6.  Flesh-out the scenario in terms of driving forces 
7.  Analyze implications 
8.  Define leading indicators for monitoring

Scenarios: Rules 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

  Goal: 
  Required decisions under each scenario? Vulnerabilities? 
Can we control the key driving forces?… 
  Good scenarios should be plausible, but also 
surprising by breaking old stereotypes 
  Do not assign probabilities to each scenario… 
  … But give a name to each scenario 
  A total of 3-4 scenarios: Not just two extremes 
plus a probableone. Good to have a wildcard

Demographics as an example 

  Fertility rate:

  Avg no. of children  

born to women over 

their lifetime 

  Birth rate:

  Total no of births  

divided by the size of 

the population

	 Canada claims a low  

fertility rate (1.7) but 

a high birth rate

Demographics 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

	 According to Professor David K. Foot (“Boom, 
Bust and Echo”), future scenarios entail some 
certainty: In 10 yrs, we will all be 10 yrs older 
	 Demographics, not only predictable, but 
inevitable: The most powerful, yet underutilized 
tool, to understand the past and foretell the 
future 
	 Age is a good predictor of behavior… and 
therefore, a good forecasting tool

Communication Tools 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

  Transportation Policy depends to a great extent 
on two-way communications:

  Policy analysts ÕÖ  elected officials 

  Elected officials ÕÖ  other politicians

  Elected officials ÕÖ mass media

  Public at large ÕÖ  elected officials

  …………………. ÕÖ  ………………….

  But impact of a message is based on: 
  words (7%), 
  how words are said (38%), and, 
  non verbal clues (55%)
