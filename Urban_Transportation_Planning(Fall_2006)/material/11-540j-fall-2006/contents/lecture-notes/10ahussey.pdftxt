Transportation leadership you can trust.

What is a “New Start”?

“Any fixed guide-way system which utilizes and occupies a
separate right-of-way, or rail line, for the exclusive use of mass
transportation and other high occupancy vehicles, or uses a 
fixed catenary system and a right-of-way usable by other forms
of transportation”

Rapid rail
Light rail
Commuter rail
Automated guide-way transit
People movers
Exclusive facilities for buses (such as bus rapid transit)
or other HOVs

FTA Rating Process (continued)

Summary project justification ratings and finance ratings 
are in turn used to determine overall project ratings to the 
following decision rule
• High – projects must be rated at least medium-high for both 
finance and project justification 
• Medium – projects must be rated at least medium for both 
finance and project justification
• Low – projects not rated at least medium in both finance and 
project justification will be rated as not recommended
• Not rated – indicates that FTA has serious concerns about the 
information submitted for the mobility improvements and cost 
effectiveness criteria because the underlying assumptions 
used by the project sponsor may have inaccurately 
represented the benefits of the project
• Not available – given to projects that did not submit complete 
data to FTA for evaluation 

10

FTA Definition of User Benefits

“User benefits are the changes in mobility for 
individual travelers that are caused by a project 
or policy change, measured in hours of travel 
time, and summed over all travelers.”

11

User Benefits are Computed from Local Mode 
Choice Models

The use of the logit model is assumed –

U1 = B0 + B11 X1 + B21X2 + … + Bn1Xn

Prob(1) = 

exp(U1)
Σ exp(Uj)

12

Mode Choice Model Variables

Income

Auto ownership

Area type

Pedestrian environment

In-vehicle time

Wait time

Walk access time

Auto access time

Fare

Parking cost

Transfers

13

Logsum Variable

Log of denominator of the logit function

Logsum = ln Σ exp(Uj)

Represents the composite utility of all alternatives, 
including all variables

Increase in the utility of any alternative results in an 
increase in the logsum value

14

FTA User Benefits Calculation

Logsum value expressed in units of time –

User benefits = 

ln Σ exp(U1)
in-veh. time coeff.

15

The FTA SUMMIT Program

Computes user benefits as defined

Two parts
• Code added to mode choice model script to save logsum 
values
• Post processor to save and report user benefits results

Provides a variety of reports, maps, and graphics 
showing the magnitude and locations of user benefits

16

Example of User Benefits Output

17

SUMMIT Program Use as Diagnostic

Previously unknown problems with models

Problems with highway time savings

Inconsistencies with other models

Problems in definitions of the alternatives

18

FTA Proposed Guidelines for Models

No “cliffs” in level of service variables
• Maximum travel or wait times
• Maximum access distances or times
• Minimum times by submode

Restrictions on model coefficients
• Compelling evidence if Civt < -0.03 or Civt > -0.02
• Compelling evidence if using mode-specific Civt
• Compelling evidence if 2.0 < Covt/Civt < 3.0
• No “bizarre” constants

19

Mobility Improvements

Travel time savings 
• User benefit calculation expressed in time equivalent units 
(hours) 
• Produces multimodal measure of traveler utility for all users 
of the transportation system

Number of low income households served
• GIS analysis using Census data, one-half mile radius around 
stations

Number of jobs near stations
• GIS analysis using best available local data sources

20

Environmental Benefits

Change in criteria pollutant and precursor emissions and 
greenhouse gas emissions
• Annual regional VMT by vehicle classification
• Local emissions factors derived from Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) MOBILE emissions model

Change in regional energy consumption in the forecast 
year
• Calculated in BTUs, using regional VMT

Current regional air quality designation by EPA

21

Operating Efficiencies

Change in systemwide operating cost per passenger mile

• Calculated using forecast annual passenger miles and 
operating costs

• Changes greater than 5 cents need to be explained

22

Cost Effectiveness

Incremental cost divided by transportation system
user benefits

• Generated using SUMMIT software and annual systemwide 
capital and operating costs

Incremental cost per incremental rider

• Generated by dividing change in annual capital/operating 
costs by change in annual linked trips

23

Existing Land Use, Transit Supportive Land 
Use, and Future Patterns

I. Existing Land Use

a. Existing

II. Transit Supportive Plans
and Policies
a. Growth Management
b. Transit Supportive
c. Supportive Corridor 
Policies
d. Tools to Implement 
Land Use Policies

III. Performance and Impacts
of Policies
a. Performance of Land Use 
Policies
b. Potential Impact of Transit 
Project on Regional Land Use

IV. Other Land Use
Considerations
Exceptional examples, e.g.:
• Historic
• Environmental
• Community preservation
• Brownfields redevelopment
• Designated Federal Enterprise 
Zone/Empowerment Community

24

Other Factors

The degree that institutions (local transportation 
initiatives, parking policies, etc.) are in place as assumed 
in the forecasts

Multimodal emphasis of the locally preferred investment 
strategy, including the Section 5309 New Starts project as
one element

Environmental justice considerations and equity issues

Opportunities for increased access to employment for low 
income persons, and welfare to work initiatives

25

Other Factors (continued)

Outstanding or unique public involvement program 
activities, including private sector and institutional 
involvement

Livable communities initiatives and local economic 
development initiatives

Consideration of alternative land use development 
scenarios in local evaluation and decision-making for the 
locally preferred transit investment decision

Consideration of innovative financing, procurement, and 
construction techniques, including design-build turnkey 
applications

26

Local Financial Commitment

The proposed share of total project costs from sources 
other than the New Starts portion of Section 5309, including 
Federal formula and flexible funds, the local match required 
by Federal law, and any additional capital funding

The strength of the proposed capital funding plan

The ability of the sponsoring agency to fund operation and 
maintenance of the entire transit system as planned once 
the guide-way is built

27

GAO Report to Congressional Committees 

“FTA New Starts Program is in a period of transition”

Incorporation of economic development into evaluation 
process

Implementation of Small Starts

28

Recent Procedural Changes 

Overall project rating to be “low,” “medium,” or “high”
replacing the previous three-point rating scale of not 
recommended, recommended, or highly recommended

New FTA documentation review requirements during 
alternatives analysis
• Scope of work
• Problem statement, goals, and objectives
• Definition of alternatives
• Study assumptions and methodologies
• Study results

29

Recent Procedural Changes (continued)

Project must have progressed beyond the NEPA scoping 
phase before entering PE

Final EIS must present the New Starts rating for its LPA

Before- and after-study data must be prepared and 
reported to FTA during AA and project development

Cap to be placed on FFGA New Starts funding amount at 
the point of approval to enter into final design
