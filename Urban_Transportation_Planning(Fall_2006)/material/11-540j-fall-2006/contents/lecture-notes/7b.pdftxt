Parking freeze at 1973 levels plus 10% with exceptions for off-street 
parking “based on need” (ie. hotels) and residential parking.

Parking Tour: Manhattan

(cid:132)

(cid:132)

If you come, 
don’t drive or 
you´ll pay for 
the tunnels and 
the bridges

If you drive, 
park only once 
and don’t 
bother us!

Parking Tour: Getxo

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Parking Goals:
(cid:132) To enhance the economic and social vitality 
of Getxo´s downtown areas by improving 
access to local shops and services
(cid:132) To discourage home-to-work trips by 
automobile to Getxo’s downtown
(cid:132) To encourage use of public transport and 
non motorized trips

Parking Policy: A Moving Target

(cid:132) In Getxo, the real goal was 
to attract shopping trips by 
car in order to protect the 
local shops

(cid:132) The reason was that a 
nearby municipality chose 
to build a new regional 
shopping center with ample 
supply of free parking

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

22

Parking Tour:
New Bilbao Exhibition Center

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) For the new Bilbao
Exhibition Center, we 
managed to convince the 
property to reduce the 
plans for an underground 
parking from 10,000 to 
3,000 (+1,000) spaces

(cid:132) The reason being simply 
that road congestion 
would not allow to 
release 10,000 cars in 
less than an hour into the 
road system

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

23

Parking Tour:
New Bilbao Exhibition Center

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The argument was 
supported on a new 
subway station planned 
by the new Exhibition 
Center main entrance

(cid:132) … And they accepted that 
with every entry ticket, 
people would also get a 
subway ticket

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

24

Parking Tour:
New Bilbao Exhibition Center

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) However, the parking 
demand was probably 
close to 10,000!
(cid:132) The challenge was 
therefore how to 
discourage drivers from 
creating a waiting queue 
in the expressway
(cid:132) The recommendation 
called for phone/internet 
reservation of a parking 
space based on a credit 
card and the vehicle plate 
numbers

Parking Tour:
New Master Plan in Bilbao by Zaha Hadid

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

The new master plan 
for Zorrotzaurre in 
Bilbao by a world class 
architect is so 
constrained by zoning 
regulations related to 
density and parking 
supply, that the 
successful Bilbao
downtown could not 
be replicated!

The Zürich Experience

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Limiting parking for commuters in the 
downtown area

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

Parking Tour:
Three Messages from Zürich

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) 1.- If you ask the residents which transport policy to 
adopt, they will not choose the car.  They are far more 
intelligent than what politicians and opinion leaders believe

(cid:132) 2.- The future lies not in expansion but in a more 
intelligent use of the existing system, using new telecoms 

(cid:132) 3.- Economy and Ecology are not contradictory. Zürich as 
an example of promotion of public transport, at the 
expense of private transport, to achieve a high degree of 
economic development 

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

28

Parking Policy:
Every trip ends in a parking maneuver…

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Then while debating “Congestion Pricing”, 
why is parking policy not being used to 
achieve the same goal?? Even though 
Mayor Livingstone has the power to tax 
work-centers parking!

(cid:132) TCRP Report 40  “Strategies to Attract 
Auto Users to Public Transportation”, TRB-
NRC 1998  (cid:214) Parking Policy

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

29

Parking Policy
Strategies to Attract Auto Users to Public Transportation

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Cities with restrictive 
parking practices tend 
to have better transit 
service and higher 
transit ridership rates. 
(cid:132) Factors related to 
parking price have a 
stronger effect on mode 
choice than do factors 
related to transit service

Parking Policy: 
Probably The Most Critical Transport Issue

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Parking policy may influence:
(cid:132) Mode choice
(cid:132) Transit supply
(cid:132) Destination
(cid:132) Frequency
(cid:132) Car occupancy
(cid:132) Development types
(cid:132) Development costs
(cid:132) Traffic Congestion
(cid:132) Urban Quality

(cid:132) Two basic types:
(cid:132) Commuter
(cid:132) Shoppers

(cid:132) Parking Mgt Programs:
(cid:132) Caps in CBD
(cid:132) Max rates, not min
(cid:132) Parking tax on off street 
parking
(cid:132) Max hourly rates
(cid:132) Supply and cost of on street 
parking
(cid:132) Parking controls
(cid:132) Residential permits

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

31

Parking Policy:
Resulting parking criteria

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Parking policies which discriminate against 
long-stay parking in favor of short-stay 
shopping and business users

(cid:132) Maximum (Not MINIMUN!) parking standards 
at trip attractors specified during the 
development planning processes.  

(cid:132) Note that the ITE standards are minimum 
parking requirements according to current US 
practice

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

32

Parking Policy: 
Maximum (not minimum) parking ratios

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Portland, OR policies have reduced the 
number of parking spaces per 1,000 square 
feet of office/commercial space from 3.4 in 
1973 to 1.5 in 1990
(cid:132) San Francisco limited to 7% the floor area 
devoted to parking resulting in only 17% 
driving alone to work

(cid:132) By contrast suburban office and business 
parks offer from 3 to 4 parking spaces per 
1,000 square feet

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

33

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
It might take time to go from minimum to 
maximum parking ratios…

(cid:132) Commercial off-street parking facilities may be traced to 
Los Angeles in 1917
(cid:132) City of Los Angeles banned parking on downtown streets 
in 1919 to relieve traffic congestion
(cid:132) By 1935, Los Angeles requested through zoning, a covered 
garage for all new two-family houses and multi-family 
units
(cid:132) By 1946 off-street parking requirements extended to 
hotels, clubs, churches..
(cid:132) By 1954, there were 311 communities with off-street 
parking requirements in their local ordinances 

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

34

Parking Policy:
The Dutch A-B-C policy in terms of parking

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The Dutch Ministry of Land Use and Transportation 
tried to regulate the location of new employment 
based on the quality of the transit network
(cid:132) Location type A (high quality transit) for type A 
centers (high no of employees): parking 10 spaces 
per 100 employees
(cid:132) Location type B: 20 spaces per 100 employees
(cid:132) Location type C (no transit but near expressway 
interchanges) for type C Centers (goods movement): 
40 spaces per 100 employees

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

35

Parking Management:
A Moving Target

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) One of the main obstacles is that 
ratios are not enough to describe 
the system

(cid:132) The real issue is the total supply of 
parking spaces

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

36

Parking Management: 
Where??

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) In areas :
(cid:132) With overall clear attraction potential
(cid:132) With high quality transit service
(cid:132) Where it is not easy to move employment 
centers elsewhere

F.Salvucci & M.Murga

37

Parking Management:
Parking supply and pricing

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) They go hand in hand as the Boston 
experience clearly shows
(cid:132) Hard to establish which one is more 
influential
(cid:132) In dense areas, supply is limited thus 
forcing up the price

Parking Management:
Spill-over effects

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) When regulating on-street parking, spill 
over effects may force you to:
(cid:132) Extend gradually the area subjected to 
parking fees, or to
(cid:132) Create a buffer only for residents 

(cid:132) The South End has a working mix of 
arterials with free parking and local 
streets with “residents only” signs

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

… estimate the consequences of 
new parking policies, since they

new types of parking
•
new locations of parking
•
•
new duration for parking
new mode of travel
•
•
different car occupancy
new destination
•
•
new frequency of trip making
new time for travel
•
new route
•

You will even find 
microscopic models
