Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

	 Let us begin by a world tour 
thanks to J.Kenworthy and F. 
Laube – “The Millennium 
Cities. Data base for 
Sustainable Transport” 
sponsored by the UITP

Some Lessons by the Database Authors


Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

3.	

1.	 Transit is the least cost option when density
is higher than 20 people per hectare 
2.  Growth and income does not necessarily

imply sprawl and automobile reliance

In fact, sharp growth in automobile traffic in
cities in developing countries may
compromise economic development 
In sprawling affluent cities where the auto
dominates, speeds may be high but so are
the total travel times ( while no-car
households may lack accessibility) 

4.	

20 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 
Lessons by the Database Authors


5.  Car ownership while usually has an impact

on transit ridership, may be balanced

through mobility management policies

6.	 Parking policies are critical to curb the auto
and provide transit priority 
7.	 Transit supply and demand are clearly
correlated 
8.	 Rail modes are more attractive and 
competitive, and most cost efficient in
major cities 
9.	 The ratio of transit to automobile speed is
most critical to explain modal split 

21 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 
Lessons by the Database Authors


10.	 Low transit fares, while necessary in social
terms, are not critical to capture motorists 
11. Sustainable policy = urban planning +
traffic and parking controls + public
transport with traffic priority 
12.  In developing countries, transit  supply

shortage and high operator profits

Mobility. Analyses and Recommendations”

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 
Our suggestions and lessons 

	 Main issue is quality of life 
	 Not auto vs. transit, rather auto versus 
transit + non-motorized trips 
	 The virtuous cycle: low fares  higher 
ridership  higher frequencies 
	 Accessibility varies greatly within a 
metropolitan area (walk trips in Beacon 
Hill and auto trips in Framingham) 

23 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 
Our suggestions and lessons 

	 Cost based on local GDP obscures the fact 
that some costs are local (ie driver wages) 
with multiplier effects, while others are
international (ie. fuel, automobiles…) 
	 If you substract the transportations costs 
from the average GDP in a city, you may find
that many such cities have a higher GDP than
equivalent US cities 
	 Metropolitan area as an archipelago of 
transport arrangements 
	 Let us continue the discussion on how to deal 
with the “ocean of red circles” 

24 

A few tips… 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

  Frustration while interpreting someone else
data (or sometimes even yours) 
  Work in pairs with complementary skills 
	 We are dealing with a complex problem (with
social, economic and technical issues), simple
hypotheses will not suffice (no magic bullets) 
  Simple linear regression or multi-regression? 
  “We love our cars in the US” (and in Rome,
Nairobi, New Delhi, Copenhagen ..) 
  The myth about income and transit use 
  Do work with this database in the future 

25 

  Good luck and enjoy…
