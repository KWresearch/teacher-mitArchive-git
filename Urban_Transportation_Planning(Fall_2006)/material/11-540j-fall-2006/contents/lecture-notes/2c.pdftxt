Why Traffic Calming?

(cid:132) The faster you go, the higher 
the probability of an accident, 
as:
(cid:132) Your vision focus narrows with 
speed
(cid:132) For a given reaction time, 
distance covered is proportional 
to speed
(cid:132) The faster you go, the longer 
the stopping distance

Why Traffic Calming?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The faster you go, the higher 
the seriousness of an accident
(cid:132) For instance, the kinetic energy 
of an automobile (1.2 tons at 35 
mph) is at least 150 times higher 
than the one of a pedestrian 
(180 pounds at 3 mph)
(cid:132) Such a collision at:
(cid:132) 20 mph, means bone fractures 
and concussions
(cid:132) In the range 30-40 mph, high 
probability of either death or 
permanent disability

Why Traffic Calming?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) To avoid segregation of public 
spaces and maintain its 
livability
(cid:132) Underpasses, skywalks and 
other “solutions”, do not 
provide “eyes on the street”

Why Traffic Calming?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) When traffic is tamed, a good walking environment 
results
(cid:132) Walkers enjoy a wide range of sensory experiences
(cid:132) When most people drive, the buildings end up lacking the 
detail and relief that people need and enjoy
(cid:132) People attract more people

Traffic Calming: How?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) When you drive at 
30 mph, you tend 
to focus your sight 
far ahead

(cid:132) This means that 
you narrow the 
sight area

(cid:132) You fail to see the 
surroundings

Day

Traffic Calming: How?

(cid:132) But if you drive 
at 20 mph, you 
start to see 
what lies on 
the sides

Traffic Calming: How?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The basic idea is to 
change the perceptions of 
the driver through the 
introduction of new 
physical features
(cid:132) These self-enforcing
features tend to break 
the infinite continuity that 
encourages speed with or 
without speed warnings

Traffic Calming: How?
Raised crosswalks

(cid:132) Double function: good for 
pedestrians… and cars
(cid:132) You accommodate to gradient:
(cid:132) 7% for 40-45 km/hr
(cid:132) 10% for 30 km/hr
(cid:132) 12% for 25 km/hr or less
(cid:132) Every 60-100 meters plus proper 
warning
(cid:132) The top table needs a minimum 
width, specially for buses
(cid:132) Automatic balancing of the car-
pedestrian relationship

exposure
(cid:132) Higher visibility 
specially for 
children
(cid:132) Easy 
implementation

Traffic Calming: How?

(cid:132) Not an end by itself, just 
the means to an end

(cid:132) It must be accompanied by 
other measures to improve 
the urban environment so as 
to encourage more 
pedestrians

(cid:132) …Although the real goal is to 
bring pedestrians to a stop

In a nutshell, ten rules

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

1. Every change is hard to implement
2. Start by the easiest job
3. You need allies
4. You have to minimize risks
5. Technical competence a must
6. Not isolated measures, but packages
7. Short term results, a must
8. But don’t forget to plant a few seeds
9. Everyone sees things differently
10. Success is hard to measure
But if you want, you can!
