Point of departure


Urban Transp Planning 2006 

	 “In a world being steadily privatized, in 
some cities public spaces are gaining in 
importance… People respond enthusiastically 
to these new opportunities for walking and 
participating in public life in public spaces” 

	 “People are invited to reposses their cities 
and restrictions are being made to reduce 
parking and traffic in city areas in order to 
make room for more people oriented 
activities”

  Ströget as a pedestrian street? 
  But, why? We Scandinavians stay indoors, not 
like those in Southern Europe! 
  After all our weather is lousy
