The Automobile – Capacity

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The capacity of a facility is 
the maximum hourly rate 
at which persons or 
vehicles reasonably can be 
expected to traverse a 
point or a uniform section 
of a lane or roadway 
during a given time period 
under prevailing roadway, 
traffic, and control 
conditions
