Transport a Complex Organic System

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The microscopic simulation shows pedestrians, cars, 
buses, taxis… We are trying to model individuals:
(cid:132) Who appear to behave sometimes in irrational, chaotic or 
emotional ways
(cid:132) Who are driven by habits (change takes time!)
(cid:132) Who learn and adapt (specially under worsening conditions)

(cid:132) Predicting their collective behavior through models is 
never easy. That is why we do not have “to educate 
them”, but rather: 
(cid:132) Observe their behavior and search for their “logic bubble”
(cid:132) Ask their opinions and find out about their perceptions

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
Transport a Complex Organic System

(cid:132) Many of us went into Engineering to deal with
predictable systems, but NOT WITH PEOPLE!

In Engineering Schools:
(cid:132) This is THE problem
(cid:132) We want THE solution

(cid:132) Transport deals with people who appear to 
behave: Irrationally, Intuitively, Unpredictably …

From: Business Dynamics, by John D. Sterman 

Transport  a Complex Organic System

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) We need a holistic approach to transportation to 
recognize and take advantage of all the interactions 
among:

(cid:132) Transportation modes
(cid:132) Land use
(cid:132) Quality of life of residents
(cid:132) Economic development
(cid:132) …………

(cid:132) Just focusing for instance on transit will not do it!

Day 1

Transportation

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

Transportation is a great field to be in!

“… simplistic solutions are proposed with sublime assurance, 
as if the construction of some type of transportation used 
in another city, would suddenly solve all problems”

“And these large matters are discussed without any 
organized framework, without any consideration of goals, 
mostly without any data ...”

“It is almost as if people delight in having an area in which 
anybody can speculate because nobody knows anything”

Roger L. Creighton, Urban Transportation Planning, 1970

Day 1

A Quick Overview of Transport Issues

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The automobile
(cid:132) Transit: Past … and Future
(cid:132) Transportation
(cid:132) … And Land Use
(cid:132) Technological Fixes
(cid:132) Closing Thoughts

Day 1

11

The Automobile

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Convenience, comfort, 
flexibility…
(cid:132) Who is against the 
American way of life?
(cid:132) It drives the economy!
(cid:132) Don’t leave home 
without it!

Day 1

12

The Automobile

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) How much does it cost? 
(cid:132) To the driver
(cid:132) To the rest of society
(cid:132) Fixed and operating costs
(cid:132) What is the required infrastructure?
(cid:132) What do we mean by externalities?

Day 1

13

The Automobile

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Current urban development 
trends increase car ownership 
and use

(cid:132) Car operating costs are lower 
than ownership costs. So once 
you buy it…

(cid:132) Drivers do not pay full costs 
(despite lobby claims to the 
contrary)

(cid:132) Main Threat:
IRREVERSIBILITIES

Day 1

14

The Automobile

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Some prevailing popular beliefs:

-car taxes exceed car induced costs
-car mobility is a right
-proper technology will solve the 
problem

(cid:132) which together with the lack of "quick 
fixes", compound the problem

Day 1

15

The Automobile

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

Suburban sprawl: 
(cid:132) A dream made true by the car
(cid:132) Have we locked ourselves into it?
(cid:132) What does it imply?
(cid:132) From city life to Edge Cities?

Transit to the rescue!

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) We are all in favor!
(cid:132) But my case is 
special
(cid:132) Choice … and captive 
riders
(cid:132) Levels-of-Service 
(LOS) like the car? 
It’s about time!

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

Transit 

Is it a panacea? 

A tram with say 230 
riders  is equivalent to 
177 automobiles 
with an occupancy 
ratio of 1.3... 
provided they are 
all choice riders

Transit

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Every major transit 
project (as every road 
scheme) is announced 
as “the solution”
(cid:132) Sometimes hard to see 
the opportunities which 
open up if the right 
process is engaged

Day 1

Transit

(cid:132) How do we rate it a success?
(cid:132) Total number of trips?
(cid:132) The % of patrons: captive vs
choice riders?
(cid:132) Total transit trips per capita?
(cid:132) Transit share of the overall 
mobility market?
(cid:132) The level of city traffic?
(cid:132) The density of jobs?
(cid:132) The impact on the real estate 
and retail markets?
(cid:132) The Bump Factor?

The Competition from the Car Road System

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

• Urban parking supply is relatively widely available and 
often free
•95% of car commuters enjoy free parking
•380 parking spaces per 1000 central city workers in 10 largest  
US cities
• Highly developed urban road system
•6.6 metres of road per capita in 10 largest US cities;  3 times 
European levels

Arguments Supporting Public Transport

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Equity:  
(cid:132) Access for those who cannot or do not choose to drive
(cid:132) Congestion:  
(cid:132) The need for a high-quality alternative
(cid:132) Land use influence:  
(cid:132) Public transport is necessary, but not sufficient to change trends
(cid:132) Environmental:  
(cid:132) Are car technology strategies effective?
(cid:132) Energy:  
(cid:132) Are car technology strategies effective?

Day 1

25

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
Other Arguments Supporting Transit

(cid:132) Transit allows agglomeration of 
economic activity in cities:
(cid:132) New York, Boston, San Francisco, etc could 
not have developed without transit
(cid:132) The current contribution of earlier 
investments in heavy rail is not valued 
today appropriately
(cid:132) New investments bound to have a lasting 
impact – thus the need for a long view 

Day 1

26

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
Other Arguments Supporting Transit

(cid:132) Transit is a most effective tool to 
decrease external costs in cities:
(cid:132) These costs may exceed $1,000 per person 
per year (Ref: External Costs Study for the 
Basque Country, 2006)
(cid:132) They correspond in order of importance to 
accident-related costs, impacts on human 
health, congestion, noise impacts and the 
current market value of global warming

(cid:132) Implications of the 
number of automobiles 
in USA exceeding the 
number of licensed 
drivers

Day 1

28

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
Other Arguments Supporting Transit

(cid:132) Transit reduces the auto ownership 
need:
(cid:132) This should be converted into a yearly 
stream of net benefits, based on the 
savings of capital and operating costs (the 
hidden part of the iceberg  -F.Salvucci)
(cid:132) This and the previous arguments underline 
the need to define a new evaluation 
framework for public transport

Day 1

29

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
Other Arguments Supporting Transit

(cid:132) Transit is often associated to operating 
inefficiencies, but:
(cid:132) Most agencies have already improved 
efficiency
(cid:132) Many of today’s new technologies just 
focus on the quality of service perceived by 
users, not on efficiency
(cid:132) Similarly to other fields (Education, 
Health…) heavily dependent on local labor, 
transit is subject to “Baumol’s Disease.

Day 1

30

Other Arguments Supporting Transit

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The key is the 
enhancement of the 
quality of the urban space
(cid:132) Public Transport can be a 
catalyst for this process:
(cid:132) Melbourne is clearly one of 
the new success stories as 
described so well by Jan 
Gehl (Places for People. Melbourne, 2004)
(cid:132) Seoul received an award 
during last year’s TRB

Day 1

33

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
Other Arguments Supporting Transit

(cid:132) The Land Use Connection:
(cid:132) We tend to concentrate our 
analysis on the disaggregate 
behavior of individual 
drivers to anticipate their 
reaction to system changes 
(cid:132) However a more relevant 
question is who is shaping 
the “maze” into which the 
mice are constrained

Day 1

34

Other Arguments Supporting Transit

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) The lesson is that rail 
transit needs to resume 
its traditional role as 
shaper of urban 
development
(cid:132) By abandoning that 
role, highways are the 
ones guiding the 
location of new 
residential and job 
centers developments

Day 1

Transit: The example from Bilbao

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) Metropolitan Bilbao, in 
the Basque Country of 
Spain, is a good 
example of balanced 
investments between 
highways and transit
(cid:132) In the last decade, the 
transit network added a 
state-of-the-art new 
subway, a new Light Rail 
and new refurbishment 
of the RENFE, FEVE and 
ET rail networks

has not been enough to turn the 
tide…

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
The Land Use-Transport Link

(cid:132) As a chicken and egg problem, job 
density and parking restrictions go hand 
in hand
(cid:132) But parking restrictions do not impede 
economic development
(cid:132) In fact, Boston development has been 
very impressive, since its EPA led 
parking freeze in 1973

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

(cid:132) ITS tools easy to buy… but difficult to 
integrate
(cid:132) They require organizational changes 
and new networking schemes
(cid:132) Existing technological, political and 
jurisdictional barriers have to be 
addressed
(cid:132) ITS itself has to be integrated into 
conventional planning

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
“The Future of Operations Research (OR) is Past”
by Russell Ackoff 1979

1. First, there is a greater need for 
decision-making systems that can 
learn and adapt effectively than 
there is for optimizing systems that 
cannot.
2. Second, in decision making, account 
should be taken of aesthetic values-
stylistic preferences and progress 
towards ideals because they are 
relevant to quality of life.
3. Third, problems are abstracted from 
systems of problems, messes. 
Messes require holistic treatment. 
They cannot be treated effectively by 
decomposing them analytically into 
separate problems to which optimal 
solutions are sought.

Day 1

4. Fourth, OR's analytic problem-
solving paradigm, "predict and 
prepare," involves internal 
contradictions and should be 
replaced by a synthesizing planning 
paradigm such as "design a 
desirable future and invent 
ways of bringing it about”.
5. Fifth, effective treatment of messes 
requires interaction of a wide 
variety of disciplines, a 
requirement that OR no longer 
meets.
6. Sixth and last, all those who can be 
affected by the output of 
decision making should either be 
involved in it so they can bring their 
interests to bear on it, or their 
interests should be well 
represented by researchers who 
serve as their advocates.
