Note:  Toll revenue KIGH is larger than
Toll revenue ABCD but less than
Toll revenue ABCD plus consumer surplus ILDC

Problem: Surplus FCE and LHC are not real because congestion 
destroys it

Note: Toll authority has temptation to “overtoll”

But assume “technology”, such as 
-Transit or
-Larger aircraft or
-Off-peak discounted tolls and or

-Assume toll recovery helps to buy the “technology” transit expansion
