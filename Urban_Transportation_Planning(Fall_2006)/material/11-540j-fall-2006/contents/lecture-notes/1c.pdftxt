The Planning Method:
Why we need 12 Steps, not just 5?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

1. Scan the environment, 
review history, identify 
trends, project future 
conditions
2. Identify relevant 
actors, institutions, 
primary roles and 
interests
3. Define problem(s)
4. Develop solution(s)
5. Consider 
implementation
6. Predict outcomes, 
benefits, costs, impacts

7. Consider operation and 
maintenance of 
facilities, services
8. Evaluate alternatives
9. Choose course of 
action
10.Build constituency, 
consolidate allies, 
convert enemies
11.Implement
12.Operate and maintain

Alternative Interpretations: Planning as…

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

1. … predicting the future to accommodate demand
2. … imagining a different future and developing an 
strategy to get there
3. … as infrastructure planning
4. … a system of public infrastructure and mixture 
of public and private vehicles
5. … as service planning
6. … as mobility planning
7. … as accessibility planning

Changing the Concept of Transportation Planning

1. Bottleneck modification
2. Highway system function; benefit/cost
3. Transportation system function; benefit/cost
Inclusion of “external” impacts; full 
4.
costs/benefits
Inclusion of “external impacts with 
mitigation

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006
Can We Be Realistic AND Positive?

(cid:132) Currently 750 million vehicles in world.  By 2050, number 
is projected to be 2 billion.  [Factor of 3]

(cid:132) Is it feasible to reduce petroleum consumption per vehicle 
by a factor of 4?  Could we really change?

(cid:132) Maybe.  If we can implement a 20% fuel consumption 
reduction in each of 6 different areas:
0.86 = 0.26

(cid:132) Will require changes in technology, vehicles, system 
operation, and behavior.  Technology is key, but not 
enough.

Ways to Impact Energy Use: Behavior

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006

1.

Encourage less aggressive driver behavior
Increase vehicle occupancy on substantial 
fraction of trips
3. Reduce mileage driven per person per year
Substitute bio-mass fuels for petroleum fuels
4.
5. Manage existing transportation system more 
effectively (ITS)
Increase public transit utilization

6.

Shift the vehicle performance/fuel economy tradeoff 
towards lower fuel consumption
Improve vehicle maintenance, lubricants, tire pressure, 
reduce parasitic loads
Lighter weight, “less big” vehicles
Implement more efficient engine, drivetrain, and vehicle 
technologies
Develop and implement use of hydrogen as an energy 
carrier with fuel cell powered vehicles
Use electricity with advanced battery technologies to 
shift part of transportation energy demand away from 
petroleum
