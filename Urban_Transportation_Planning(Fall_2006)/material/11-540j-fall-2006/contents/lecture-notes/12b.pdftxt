A Rapidly Flattening World 

“The result … is the creation 
of a global network, Web-
enabled playing field that 
allows for multiple forms of 
collaboration – sharing 
knowledge and work – in 
real time, without regard to 
geography, distance, or in 
the future, even language”

ITS Deployment 

  ITS Deployment 
requires: 
  Important organizational 
changes 
  A new path from control 
to sharing information 
  A transition from 
hierarchical systems to 
networks 

F.Salvucci and M.Murga

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 
ITS Integration: A bumpy road 

 Let’s share information: 
  The public needs a single source of multi-
modal information 
  The operators can benefit by sharing real 
time info 
 Let’s decide with others in mind: 
  Impacts or synergies on third parties? 
  Modularity of equipment and architecture? 

F.Salvucci and M.Murga 

71 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 
ITS Integration: A bumpy road 

ITS is not a technical 
issue but a new frame 
for: 
>  Voluntary cooperation 
>  Seeing the big picture 
>  Bringing others into 
the decision process

>  Adopting necessary 
new policies 

F.Salvucci and M.Murga 

72 

ITS Deployment 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

In short, ITS other than short-term mitigation  

tools, may serve : 
9  To become catalysts for change 
9  To establish new two-way relationships 
9  To create new spaces for collaboration 
9  To provide a global vision of the transport 
system 

… But, ITS involves a long complex and  

difficult path (the road less traveled)


F.Salvucci and M.Murga 

73 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 
ITS as a Tool - Main Objectives? 

  To increase road capacity at low cost? 
  Or, just an opportunity to promote a more  

efficient and diversified transport system?

  Should it be used to enhance mobility --
Or to improve accessibility? Or perhaps, just 
to substitute some trips on certain days? 

F.Salvucci and M.Murga 

74 

Final thought 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

  We have to: 
  master the technology 
  envisage new applications from the existing
technology, and 
  retain a proper global perspective 

  What do you think… 
  Is ITS good or bad? 
  What is its main contribution? 
  Is technology in general good or bad?
