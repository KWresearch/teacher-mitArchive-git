Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 
“The Future of Operations Research (OR) is Past” 
by Russell Ackoff 1979 

1.	 First, there is a greater need for
decision-making systems that can
learn and adapt effectively than
there is for optimizing systems that 
cannot. 
2.	 Second, in decision making, account 
should be taken of aesthetic values-
stylistic preferences and progress 
towards ideals because they are
relevant to quality of life. 
3.	 Third, problems are abstracted from
systems of problems, messes.
Messes require holistic treatment. 
They cannot be treated effectively by
decomposing them analytically into
separate problems to which optimal
solutions are sought. 

4.	 Fourth, OR's analytic problem-
solving paradigm, "predict and
prepare," involves internal
contradictions and should be 
replaced by a synthesizing planning 
paradigm such as "design a
desirable future and invent 
ways of bringing it about”. 
5.	 Fifth, effective treatment of messes 
requires interaction of a wide 
variety of disciplines, a 
requirement that OR no longer 
meets. 
6.	 Sixth and last, all those who can be 
affected by the output of
decision making should either be
involved in it so they can bring their
interests to bear on it, or their 
interests should be well 
represented by researchers who
serve as their advocates.

Where to focus on? 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

	 Transportation solutions to current 
problems like congestion, a bitter pill 
	 The systemsview aligns transportation 
proposals with higher goals 
	 You will have to be creative in the use 
of your tools and approaches 
	 Search for a higher goal beyond 
transport symptoms

Focus on …. 

… Economic development 

  Look at American and European cities  

with subways… 
  When were those systems built? 
  Have they shaped those cities? 
  How should we then evaluate their 
contribution???

Focus on…  Quality of Life 

	 When traffic is tamed, a good walking environment 
results 
	 Walkers enjoy a wide range of sensory experiences 
	 When most people drive, the buildings end up lacking the 
detail and relief that people need and enjoy 
	 People attract more people

point between auto

Point A is really a
“policy trigger point”,
rather than an 
“equilibrium point”, 
as it leads to build 
extra highway

As the fight against
congestion translates into
extra highway capacity  ­
as shown by the dotted
brown line-, this process
ends up in a new 
congestion point at C 

This point C may become 
again another “policy 
trigger point” under
economic growth

The way from point A to 
point C spans a few years 
during which induced 
demand and further 
development causes a new 
congestion point at C.

The path from A to C goes 
initially through point B, 
which often encourages 
higher automobile 
ownership ratios given the
improved highway LOS.

Vol auto 
Vol pt 
Adapted from “Transport in Santiago” presentation by Dr. Diaz-Jara at MIT 
This process ends at C as a no-win situation, because not only 

transit loses part of its market share, but costs increase for  

both transit and the automobile

An alternative process to 
the A-B-C path implies a 
more aggressive role for 
transit, by responding to 
congestion with a 
dramatic increase in 
transit capacity as 
represented by the blue 
dotted line. 

Vol pt 
Adapted from “Transport in Santiago” presentation by Dr. Diaz-Jara at MIT

The new path from A to D in green, assisted by other policy measures, results in a 
more desirable and sustainable outcome with lower costs for all. At the same time, 
point D is an equilibrium point given its more “acceptable” level of congestion

New Indicators for Transit 

	 Transit makes high density central city possible 
	 Even in the US with transit serving only 2% of all person 
trips, it is critically important in shaping the big cities 
	 The home to work commute in Boston (and in other 
American cities like Chicago, New York, San Francisco..) 
shows the critical role of transit in its downtown 
	 The downtown job density makes it impossible to rely 
solely on the automobile

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

Of all the kinds of work I can imagine the hardest 
work of all is thinking --and that's why most 
people just don't do it.” 
Henry Ford in his highly original 
"My Philosophy of Industry" published in 1929 

You will be surprised how often you can  

make meaningful proposals with a bit of  

thinking plus some creativity

	 It is easy to end up
sounding like a “Prophet”
when just selling one
single measure: ie.

When contributing, remember that… 

1.  Every change is hard to implement 
2.  You should start with the easiest job 
3.  You need allies 
4.  You have to minimize risks 
5.  Technical competence is a must 
6.  Do not propose isolated measures, but packages 
7.  Focus on short term results to jumpstart the process 

8.  But don’t forget to plant a few seeds 
9.  Everyone sees things differently, and that 
10. Success is hard to measure

A thought by Ortega y Gasset for solo flying 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

“El menesteroso de una ciencia, el que siente la profunda 
necesidad de la verdad, se acercará cauteloso al saber ya 
hecho, lleno de suspicacia, sometiéndolo a crítica; más 
bién con el perjuicio de que no es verdad lo que el libro 
sostiene” 
Sobre el estudiar y el estudiante(Primera lección de un curso) 
Ortega y Gasset, 1933 

Once you are faced with an immediate problem, you 
will ponder, challenge and enrich our findings and 
solutions, as that is the only way to learn!

Final thoughts 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2006 

	 Be on the lookout for all the lessons from 
the past 
	 Do measurements and keep those records 
for future reference, and updates 
  Come up with new metrics for the actual 

contribution of transportation projects 

  You can manage only what you measure

	 Do challenge the status quo… and dare to 
be creative! 

Good luck!
