TEA-21: Project Justification Criteria 

  FTA descriptive criteria (“high”, “medium-high”, “medium”, 
“low-medium” or “low”)  on: 
  Mobility Improvements (20-year horizon): 
  Time savings (annualize properly working day figures) 
  Captives mobility: 
  No of low income households within ½ miles radius from station 
  Plus no of jobs within a ½ mile radius from stations 
  Environmental Benefits (VMT-Vehicle miles traveled): 
  Air and noise pollution annual tons (CO,NOx,VOC and PM) 
  Energy consumption in BTUs 
  Current regional air quality designation by EPA 
  Operating Efficiencies: 
  Operating cost per passenger-mile. Favor crowding?

TEA-21: Project Justification Criteria 

  FTA descriptive criteria (“high”, “medium-high”, “medium”, 
“low-medium” or “low”)  on: 
  Transport System User Benefits (Cost Effectiveness): 
  Goal: To reduce the travel time and out-of-pocket costs 
  Measure changes on capital and operating costs and travel time 
changes to users of transit, highway and other travel modes 
  It replaces “the cost per new rider” so as: 
  To show benefits to existing users using different modes 
  To avoid bias against existing systems improving travel times 
and/or crowding 

  Incremental Cost per Incremental Passenger: 
  It utilizes linked trips (from origin to final destination) which may 
be composed of several unlinked trips.

  Concentration of development. Land conservation 
  Transit supportive corridor policies:

TEA-21: Final considerations 

  The project “No-Build Alternative” 
  Not necessarily a “do nothing” scenario 
  It is hard to accept that no improvement will occur if the 
proposed new start does not go ahead 
  A single “baseline alternative”: 
  Transit improvements lower in cost than the new start: 
  Traffic engineering measures, reserved lanes, enhanced bus service… 
  “The best you can do” w/o the new start investment 
  It may include highway improvements 
  Same policy measures as for the new start (i.e. parking, land use 
patterns, transit fares…)  Will they be possible??

TEA-21: Final considerations 

  Travel Demand Forecasting Assumptions: 
  Same assumptions on socio-economic variables 
and land use 
  Consistency among alternatives on speeds and 
out-of-vehicle times (access, wait, transfers…) 
  Transit speeds must reflect congestion 
  Consistent highway volume-time functions 
  Identical factors among alternatives (tolls, 
parking…)

Closing Thought 

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2005 

	 FHWA does not have to follow an 
equivalent procedure to that of FTA 
	 Even UK’s DETR induced demand 
procedure has not become very popular 
	 Any transit project is scrutinized to a 
point far deeper than any highway 
project
