***** Course Overview *****
This class is an introduction to planning transportation in metropolitan areas.
The approach, while rooted on the analytical tools, which estimate outcomes and
benefit/cost ratios of a given alternative, follows a holistic approach. This
means starting from a scan of the site, its history and its current trends, in
order to frame properly the problem, including the relevant actors,
institutions, roles and interests. The design and evaluation of alternatives
considers this complexity, in addition to construction, operation and
maintenance issues. The decision and implementation process, including the
needed feedback mechanisms, focuses as well on the need to build constituencies
and alliances.
The course topics include the history of urban transportation, highway finance,
environmental and planning regulations, air quality, modal characteristics,
land use and transportation interaction and emerging information technologies
for transportation planning. Students either with a primary or a peripheral
interest in transportation are equally welcome.
The course uses examples from the Boston metropolitan area extensively, both
because of its proximity and the strong influence Boston has had on U.S.
transport policy. In parallel, examples from other countries describe the
challenges faced elsewhere, as well as lessons learnt. There will be a walking
tour of several transportation sites in Boston.
***** Prerequisites *****
No prior experience in transportation issues is required. At least one course
in introductory economics is preferred, such as the required classes for the
Masters of City Planning and Master of Science in Transportation programs.
***** Assignments *****
There will be four papers involving real-world case studies and a final
project.
***** Grading *****
Grading will be as follows:
       Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES          PERCENTAGES
Papers              60%
Final project       20%
Class participation 20%
