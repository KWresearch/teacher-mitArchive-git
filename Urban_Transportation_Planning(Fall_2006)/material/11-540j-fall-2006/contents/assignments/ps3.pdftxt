Assignment #3:  South Boston Waterfront District Assignment  
Due date: 10/27/06 

 
The  South  Boston  Waterfront  District  is  seen  as  a  major  opportunity  for  "smart  growth."    But 
different constituencies define "smart" in many different ways.   
•  Some argue that this area should contain a mix of office, residential, hotel and cultural attractions, 
with very high densities. 
•  Some argue that very high density will attract more cars. 
•  Some say without more rail transit, high density can’t be supported. 
•  Some say without high density, transit won’t work. 
•  Some say the Silver Line can’t work unless it’s rail. 
•  Some say the South Boston Transitway needs a grade separation at D Street in order to be 
reliable and provide adequate capacity. 
•  Some say the grade separation isn’t necessary, and there are better places to spend transit 
funds. 

You  are  an  analyst  reporting  to  the  General  Manager  of  the  MBTA.    The  MBTA  must  make  a 
decision  on whether  or  not  to  invest  $50 million  in  a  grade  separation  at D  Street,  and  has  the  option  of 
weighing in as an advocate for land use policy, or abstaining from that debate.   

Go  visit  the  site.    Take  the  Red  Line  to  South  Station,  and  walk  across  the  Fort  Point  Channel 
 
along  Summer  Street  to  D  Street.    Proceed  east  on  D  Street  (you  can  see  the  completed  Silver  Line 
construction, on your  left as you walk down D Street)  to Northern Avenue.   Then walk  towards downtown 
on  Northern  Avenue  to  get  a  feel  for  the  area,  and  ride  the  Silver  Line  back  to  South  Station  from 
Courthouse station. 

 
Read  the  report  prepared  by  Professor  Wilson  at  MIT  which  looks  primarily  at  the  question  of 
vehicle technology, but also raises some operational and capacity issues.   

 
Write  a  3-5  page  paper  to  the  General  Manager  with  your  recommendations.    You  can 
recommend  action  or  more  study,  but  base  your  recommendation  on  an  understanding  of  the  planning 
process,  the  four-step  process,  criteria  for  priority  and  programming,  and  the  role  of  transportation  in 
economic development.
