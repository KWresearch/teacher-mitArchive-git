1.252J/11.540J Urban Transportation Planning 
Assignment #2:  Massachusetts Avenue Redesign  
Due date: 10/6/06, 2:00pm 
 
 
Background 
 
For the purpose of this exercise, you are working on the staff of Andrew Gottleib, the 

head of the Office of Commonwealth Development for the state and Governor Romney’s “czar 

of land use and transportation” responsible for implementing a new “Smart Growth” agenda. 

 

Central Square in Cambridge was re-landscaped several years ago to provide wider 

sidewalks, better bus shelters, cleaner pavement markings, bicycle lanes, as well as street trees 

and brick sidewalks.  Prior to these improvements, the Central Square section of Mass Avenue 

looked pretty much like Mass Avenue between Lafayette Square and MIT.  At right angles to 

Mass Avenue, River Street used to join Mass Avenue at an angle in the area, which is now a 

small park.  (The revision of bus routes was required to facilitate the park.)   

 

The city has plans to redevelop Lafayette Square (corner of Mass Ave/Main 

Street/Columbia Street) and redesign the stretch of Mass Ave between Central Square and 

Memorial Drive, which includes the sections adjacent to MIT.  The design plans for Lafayette 

Square and Mass. Ave. can be found on the City of Cambridge website (links below).  Mass. 

Ave, however, is a state road and the roadway portions of this reconstruction project are funded 

by the Massachusetts Highway Department (also called MassHighway or MHD).  Most parts of 

this project are already under construction, as you have probably seen. 

In addition, the City of Cambridge has recently proposed some revisions to their original 

plans for how the pavement markings, with the support of some advocacy bicycle and 

pedestrian groups and some within MIT.  Their proposed plans are detailed in two files.  The 

City of Cambridge hopes MassHighway will agree to their proposal, and Gottleib appears 

inclined to side with Cambridge.

This project, happening right outside MIT’s front door, highlights the institutional and 

political complexities involved in urban transportation planning. 

Tasks 

The first part of the assignment involves looking at the improvements at Central 

Square and observing what works and what does not work.  No formal traffic counts are 

required here; just give your impression based on recent lectures and readings. 

 

The second part of the assignment is to evaluate Mass. Ave corridor between Central 

Square and Memorial Drive, review the Lafayette Square plans and make recommendations for 

redesigning it, drawing on lessons learned from Central Square.  To do so, go and make 

observations of traffic in the area during two periods: peak hour (either AM or PM) and an off-

peak period (preferably between noon and 2 PM) measuring cars, trucks, buses, bicycles, 

pedestrians crossing the street, and pedestrians boarding/alighting buses.  Use the same 

methodology as Assignment #1.  The key location for traffic counts is the 3-way intersection of 

Columbia Street, Main Street, and Mass. Ave. Traffic counts and observations can be done in 

groups. 

You may discuss your observations within the group, but write your memo individually. 

Try to apply the planning framework presented in class to the issues you see at Mass Ave 

between Lafayette Square and Memorial Drive. 

 

The intent of this assignment is to go beyond the observations about throughput and 

capacity of Assignment #1, and consider the physical street design as well as the broader 

political and institutional context of Mass Ave.  State and federal funds that pass through the 

state are financing the reconstruction, and the responsible state agency (MassHighway) has 

strongly influenced the design of the plan, as has the City of Cambridge with support from MIT.  

 

 

 

 

Your memo should advise Gottleib on whether to intervene and how.

What are the central problem(s) the redesign is addressing?   

Who are the major institutions and constituencies? 

How would you involve the "community" and who is that? 

Imagine that the current construction activity does not preclude a change in plans. Is the 

plan for Lafayette Square reasonable, or should it be modified? 

(cid:132) 

How do you assess the current location of bus stops? Which of the alternative paint 

markings and parking plans would best fit with bus circulation? 

(cid:132) 

Develop recommendations for redesigning Mass Ave. drawing on your observations at 

Lafayette Square the Central Square redesign. 

 

 

Your paper should be approximately 5 pages single-spaced (or 10 pages double-

spaced) including any charts or images, and is due October 6 by 2:00pm.
