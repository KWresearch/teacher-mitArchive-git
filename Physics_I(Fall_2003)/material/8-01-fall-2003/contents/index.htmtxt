[Conic sections for gravitational orbits.]
Gravity is one of the fundamental forces in nature. Applying conservation laws
for energy and angular momentum results in well defined orbits for systems of
two masses. These orbits may be represented by conic sections: circles,
ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas depending on the total energy of the
system. (Figure by Prof. Stanley Kowalski.)

***** Course Description *****
Physics I is a first-year physics course which introduces students to classical
mechanics. Topics include: space and time; straight-line kinematics; motion in
a plane; forces and equilibrium; experimental basis of Newton's laws; particle
dynamics; universal gravitation; collisions and conservation laws; work and
potential energy; vibrational motion; conservative forces; inertial forces and
non-inertial frames; central force motions; rigid bodies and rotational
dynamics.
***** OCW Scholar Version *****
OCW Scholar courses are designed for self-paced study with no registration
required. They are substantially more complete than typical OCW courses,
blending new online content with material used in MIT classes.
