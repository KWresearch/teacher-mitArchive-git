Problem 1: 2D collision (15 pts)

A particle of mass m collides with a second particle of mass m. Before the collision, the ﬁrst
particle is moving in the x-direction with a speed 2v and the second particle is at rest. After

(a) Find the velocity of the ﬁrst particle after the collision. (ie ﬁnd the x- and y -components
of the velocity.)

(b) Find the total kinetic energy of the two particles before and after the collision.

(c) Is the collision elastic or inelastic?

Solution:
(a) The velocity of the second particle after the collision is (v2x , v2y ) = (v , −v). From mo-
mentum conservation in x-direction 2vm = v1xm + v2xm, we ﬁnd v1x = v . From momentum
conservation in y -direction 0 = v1ym + v2ym, we ﬁnd v1y = v .

Two balls of mass m and 2m are connected by a rod of length L. The mass of the rod is
small and can be treated as zero. The size of the balls can also be neglected. We also assume
the center of the rod is ﬁxed, but the rod can rotate about its center in the vertical plane
without friction.

mass and the ball of mass 2m.

(b) Find the moment of inertia of the two balls about the rotation axis.

(c) Find the gravity induced angular acceleration of the rod when the angle between the rod
and the vertical line is θ as shown.

(d) If the rod starts its swing from the horizontal position, what is the angular velocity of
the rod when it reaches the vertical position?

Solution:

(a) Let d be the distance between the center of mass and the ball of mass 2m. We have
(2m)d = m(L − d). We ﬁnd d = L/3 .

(b) Moment of inertia about the axis (the center of the rod): I = 2m(L/2)2+m(L/2)2 = 3

A yo-yo can be treated as a solid disk of mass m, radius R and thickness d. A string is
wrapped around a small axis of radius r in the center of the yo-yo. The mass of the string
can be ignored. Before we release the yo-yo, the string is stretched in the vertical direction.
Initially, the yo-yo is at rest and is a distance h above the ground.
After the yo-yo is released:

(a) Find the angular acceleration of the yo-yo.

(b) Find the acceleration of the center of the yo-yo.

(c) Find the tension in the string.

Solution:

(a) Choosing A as the reference point, the torque due to the gravity mg is T = mgr . (The
string tension F does not contribute to the torque about point A.) The moment of inertia
about point A is I = 1

Initially, a rod of mass m and length L moves without rotation on a frictionless surface in
a direction perpendicular to the rod. The speed of the rod is v . At time t = 0, one end
of the rod collides with (or brushes over) a ﬁxed ob ject. Just after the collision, the rod is
still parallel to the rod before the collision and the center of the rod still moves in the same
direction as before. But the speed of the center of the rod is reduced to 3
