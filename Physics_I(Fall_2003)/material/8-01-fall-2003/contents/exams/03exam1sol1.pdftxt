Problem 1: Kinematics (15 pts)
A particle moves along a straight line x. At time t = 0, its position is at x = 0. The velocity,
V , of the ob ject changes as a function of time, t, as shown in the ﬁgure. V is in m/s, x is in
meter, and t is in seconds.
(a) What is x at t = 1 sec?
(b) What is the acceleration (m/s2 ) at t = 2 sec?
(c) What is x at t = 4 sec?
(d) What is the average speed (m/s) between t = 0 and t = 3 sec?

Solution:

(a) From the area blow the velocity curve, we ﬁnd x = 6m at t = 1.
(b) From the slope of the velocity curve at t = 2, we ﬁnd a = (−6 − 6)/2 = −6m/s2 .
(c) The area below the v = 0-line has a negative contribution to the displacement. We ﬁnd
x = 0 at t = 4.

(d) The area below the v = 0-line has a negative contribution to the total distance traveled.
Average speed =(6+3+3)/3 = 4m/s. (Diﬀerent from average velocity which is (6+3−3)/3 =
2m/s)

Problem 2: Surveillance Balloon (15 pts)
A gun crew observes a remotely controlled balloon launching an instrumented spy package
in enemy territory. When ﬁrst noticed the balloon is at an altitude of 800m and moving
vertically upward at a constant velocity of 5m/s. It is 1600m down range. Shells ﬁred from
the gun have an initial velocity of 400m/s at a ﬁxed angle θ (sin θ = 3/5 and cos θ = 4/5).
The gun crew (using its 8.01 ballistic knowledge) waits and ﬁres so as to destroy the balloon.
Assume g = 10m/s2 . Neglect air resistance.
(a) What is the ﬂight time of the shell before it strikes the balloon?
(b) What is the altitude of the col lision ?
(c) How long did the gun crew wait before they ﬁred?

5m/s

400m/s

1600m

Solution:

(a) The motion in the x-direction is a constant velocity motion. We ﬁnd the ﬂight time =
1600m/vx = 1600/(400 cos θ) = 1600/(1600/5) = 5sec.
Flight time = 5sec.

(b) From the ﬂight time, the initial velocity in the y -direction and the acceleration in the
× 5− 1
y -direction, we can calculate the altitude of the shell: h = vy t− 1
× 10× 25 =
2 gt2 = 1200
1200 − 125 = 1075m.

Altitude = 1075m.

(c) After the waiting time plus the ﬂight time, the balloon should reach the same altitude
as the shell. Let tw be the waiting time. We have h = (tw + 5) × 5 + 800 = 1075.
tw + 5 = 275/5 = 55sec. So tw = 50sec.
The waiting time = 50sec.

Problem 3: Crossing a river (25 pts)
Two ports, A and B, on a North-South line are separated by a river of with D. The river
ﬂows east with speed VW . A boat cross the river from port A to port B. The speed of the
boat relative to the water is VB . Assume VB = 2VW . State all your answers in terms of VB
and D.
(a) What is the direction of the boat, θ , relative to the North so that it crosses directly on
a line from A to B? How long does the trip take?
(b) Suppose the boat wants to cross the river from A to the other side in the shortest possible
time. What direction should it head? (Hint: Think carefully about what this means.) How
long does the trip take? How far is the boat from the port B after crossing?

Solution:
(a) To reach the port B, the x-component of the total velocity must be zero: VB sin θ−Vw = 0.
So sin θ = 1/2.

The y -component of the total velocity is VB cos θ . So t = D

(b) To cross the river the fastest, we need to maximize the the y -component of the total
velocity is VB cos θ . So θ = 0. The boat should head straight to the North.
The trip takes t = D

The y -component of the total velocity is VW . So the boat is a distance tVW = DVW /VB

Problem 4: Force and Acceleration (25 pts)
A particle of mass m = 5kg, is momentarily at rest at x = 0 at t = 0. It is acted upon by
two forces (cid:2)F1 and (cid:2)F2 . (cid:2)F1 = 70ˆjN. The direction and magnitude of (cid:2)F2 are unknown. The
particle experiences a constant acceleration, (cid:2)a, in the direction as shown. Note: sin θ = 4/5,
cos θ = 3/5, and tan θ = 4/3. Neglect gravity.
(a) Find the missing force (cid:2)F2 . Either give magnitude and direction of (cid:2)F2 or its components.
Plot (cid:2)F2 on the ﬁgure. What angle does (cid:2)F2 make to the x-axis?
(b) What is the velocity vector of the particle at t = 10sec?
(c) What third force, (cid:2)F3 , is required to make the acceleration of the particle zero? Either
give magnitude and direction of (cid:2)F3 or its components.
(d) What is the vector sum of the three forces: (cid:2)F1 + (cid:2)F2 + (cid:2)F3 =?

Solution:
(a) F2x = max − F1x = 5 × 10 × cosθ − 0 = 30N .
F2y = may − F1y = 5 × 10 × sin θ − 70 = −30N .
(cid:2)F2 = (30, −30)N .
(b) (cid:2)v = 10 × (cid:2)a = (60, 80)m/s, or
|(cid:2)v | = 100m/s with direction θ relative to x-axis.
(c) The force (cid:2)F3 cancel the total acceleration. So (cid:2)F3 = −m(cid:2)a.
(cid:2)F2 = (−30, −40)N .
(d) (cid:2)F1 + (cid:2)F2 + (cid:2)F3 = (0, 70) + (30, −30) + (−30, −40) = (0, 0) = 0.
