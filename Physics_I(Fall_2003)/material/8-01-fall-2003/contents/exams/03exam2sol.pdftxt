N = m1g − F sin θ

The block m2 moves in y -direction:

m2a = T − m2g

Put in the values of m1 , m2 , F , and µ, we obtain

(b) Assume the potential energy is zero when the string is unstretched. After we pull the
M block by a distance L, the potential energy of the M block is lower by M gL sin θ , the
potential energy of the M /2 block is increased by M
2 gL, and the potential energy of the
spring is increased by 1
2 kL2 . So the total potential energy of the system is
U1 = −M gL sin θ +
