Problem 2: Circular motion (15 pts)

A car of mass m = 1000kg is traveling around a ﬂat circular race track of radius 100m. The static
coeﬃcient of friction between the tire and the road (against transverse motion) is µ = 0.5. (Assume
g = 10m/s2 )

(a) How fast can the car travel before it starts to skid? Express the speed in the units of m/s.

(b) What is the angular velocity ω of the car at the speed calculated in (a).

(c) The driver of the car wants to drive faster. He loads 500kg of weight into the car to increase
the friction force. Now how fast can the car travel without skidding?

Solution:

(a) The max speed of the car should satisfy

0.5 ∗ 100 ∗ 10 = 10
5m/s = 22m/s

(b) The angular velocity is

ω = v/r = 0.22/s

(c) v does not depend on the mass. So the max speed is not changed.

A block of mass m is tied to two strings as shown in the ﬁgure below. Each string has a length L.

3/2.) Assume the strings are massless.

(a) Draw the free-body diagram of the block.

(b) Find the tension of each string.

(c) We cut one string and the block starts to swing down. Find the speed of the block when it
reaches the lowest point.

(b) From the balance of the force in the vertical direction, we ﬁnd

mg = 2T sin θ = T

Thus T = mg .
(c) The change in the potential energy is mg(L − L sin θ) = mgL/2. Thus

So

(b)

(a) Assume the total resistive force is proportional to the velocity: Ff riction = αv . The drag
coeﬃcient α is α = 100N s/m. How fast can the car move on a level road? Express the speed in
the units of m/s.

(b) How fast can the car travel up a slope if we ignore all friction? The angle of the slope is θ
(sin(θ) = 3/5 and cos(θ) = 4/5). Express the speed in the units of m/s.

Solution:
(a) From P = vFf riction , we ﬁnd P = αv2 or
