Problem 1 (15pts) A round trip ﬂight:

An airplane ﬂies between two cities separated by a distance D. Assume the wind blows
directly from one city to the other at a speed Va and the speed of the airplane is V0 relative
to the air.

(a) How long does it take for the airplane to make a round trip between the two cities?

(b) To an observer on the ground, what is the average speed of the airplane for such a round
trip?

(c) To an observer on the ground, what is the average velocity for the round trip?

Problem 2 (15pts) Two walkers:

Two persons start from the same location O and walk around a square in opposite directions
with constant speeds. The square is 30m by 30m. A’s speed is 2m/s and B’s speed is 1m/s.

(a) Find the coordinates of the point where A and B will meet for the ﬁrst time.

(b) Find the distance between the meeting place and the origin O .

(c) Find the average velocity (cid:1)VA of A and the average velocity (cid:1)VB of B between the time
when they ﬁrst start and the time when they ﬁrst meet.
(Either give the components of (cid:1)VA and (cid:1)VB or their magnitudes and directions.)

102 + 302 = 10

(b) The distance is

10m.

(c) The average velocities of A and B are the same since they have the same net displacement
1m/s = 40s. Thus (cid:1)VA = (cid:1)VB = (10,30)m
during the same time. A and B traveled for 40m
40s =
(0.25m/s, 0.75m/s).

Problem 3 (15pts) Targeting:

A bomber ﬂies horizontally with a speed V and at a height h. Ignore the air friction and
assume there is no wind. The acceleration of gravity is g . (Express your answer in terms of
V , h, and g .)

(a) How long does it take for the bomb to reach the ground?

(b) To bomb a target, how far away from the target should the bomber release the bomb?
(ie Find the distance D in the ﬁgure below.)

(c) What is the speed of the bomb just before it hits the target?

(d) What is the location of the airplane when the bomb strikes the target.

Problem 4 (15pts) A balloon and a block:

A balloon is tied to a block. The mass of the block is 2kg . The tension of the string between
the balloon and the block is 30N . Due to the wind, the string has an angle θ relative to
the vertical direction. cos θ = 4/5 and sin θ = 3/5. Assume the acceleration of gravity is
g = 10m/s2 . Also assume the block is small so the force on the block from the wind can be
ignored.
(a) Find the x-component and the y -component of the force (cid:1)F exerted on the block by the
string.

(b) Find the x-component and the y -component of the acceleration (cid:1)a of the block.

(c) Assume the mass of the balloon is zero and the force of the wind on the balloon is in the
x-direction. Find the magnitude of the force of the wind on the balloon.

T = 30N

Solution:

(a) The magnitude of the force (from the string) is T = 30N .
The x-component = T sin θ = 30 × 3
5 = 18N .
The y -component = T cos θ = 30 × 4
5 = 24N .
(b) The total force on the block is:
the x-component = 18N .
the y -component = 24 − mg = 24 − 20 = 4N .
The x-component of the acceleration = 18N/2kg = 9m/s2 .
The y -component of the acceleration = 4N/2kg = 2m/s2 .

(c) Since the mass of the balloon is zero, the net force on the balloon must be zero. The
x-component of the force on the balloon by the string is −18N . The force from the wind on
the balloon must balance that force and thus must be 18N .
