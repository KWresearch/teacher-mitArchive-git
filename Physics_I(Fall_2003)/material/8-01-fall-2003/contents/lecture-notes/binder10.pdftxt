surface and for the hanging block. 

(a) A body on a frictionless inclined plane. 
(b) Free-body diagram. 

(a) Two blocks that are tied together with a string are pulled along by a force F. The string has a length L 
and a mass ms. (b), (c), and (d) Free-body diagrams for the block m2, the connecting string ms, and the 
block m1, respectively.
