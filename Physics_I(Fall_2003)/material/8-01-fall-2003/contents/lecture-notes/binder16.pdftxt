The graphical representation of the one-dimensional constrained potential energy function U(x) for an object. 
Also shown are various values of the total mechanical energy. 

Points (A, B, C, D) on the potential-energy versus position graph 
with zero slope are equilibrium positions. The equilibrium is 
characterized as stable (A), unstable (B), or neutral (D), 
according to the graph in the neighborhood of the equilibrium 
point. For a curve like that near point C the equilibrium cannot be 
characterized simply as stable, unstable, or neutral. 

A plot of U versus x for a system that has 
a position of unstable equilibrium, located 
at x=0. In this case, the force of the system 
for finite displacements is directed away 
from x=0.
