The mutual gravitational potential energy U = - Gm1m2/r 
between an 80-kg object and the earth is shown versus
 their separation r.

elastic and gravitational potential energies together. 

Initial position  Maximum compression 

The total fall of the block is h + y. 

The potential energy U = 1/2 kx2 is shown for a spring. When 
the spring is compressed, x<0, the slope is negative, and the 

force is positive. When the spring is stretched, x>0, the slope 

is positive, and the force is negative.
