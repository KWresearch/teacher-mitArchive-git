Centripetal force for a particle in uniform
 circular motion. 

Forces on a body whirling in a vertical
 circle with center at O. 

The total displacement from a to b has
 been divided into small intervals of ∆ x. 

The straight line is a plot of the function Fx (x)= -kx. 
The quadrilateral area to the right of a, and the left 
of b represents the work. 

A constant force F acts during a displacement ∆r. 

A force F acts during a small displacement  ∆r. 

The infinitesimal displacement dr is tangent 
to the path. 

Path of a particle. The z axis is directed
 vertically upward. 

The force acting on an object that is moving away
 from the earth yields the negative shaded area.
