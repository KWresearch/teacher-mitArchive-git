Topics: Universal Gravity and Harmonic Oscillators 

Any following problems designated with a bold number indicate problems from Young 
and Freedman 11th edition. 

1. 	 Whither the Moon?

Consider the earth-moon system.  The earth has Me = 5.98 * 10  kg,  Re = 6.378*10  m, 
Ie = 0.331 Me*Re^2, and Tday = 86164 sec (with respect to fixed stars).  The moon has 
22 
Mm = 7.35*10  kg, Torbit = 27.3 days (with respect to fixed stars, called the siderial
8 
period as opposed to the lunar month), and is Dem = 3.84*10  m from the center of the 
earth.  Approximate the earth as lying at the center of mass of the system, and ignore the 
contribution of the moon’s spin to its angular momentum. Also ignore any complications 
due to the presence of the sun. 

The two bodies exert tidal forces on each other, which are strong enough to have slowed 
the moon’s spin so that it always presents the same face to the earth.  These tidal forces 
have the same effect on the earth: the drag of moving the earth through the ocean’s tides 
reduces earth’s spin angular momentum and dissipates energy. 
a.	 What is the effect of the tides: consider the variables of angular momentum about 
the center of the earth and rotational kinetic energy.  What happens to each of 
these for the earth, the moon, and the earth-moon system? 
b.	 What configuration of the two bodies is stable against further change by the tidal 
forces? (i.e. describe the final configuration of this system?)  Specify the final 
values for the length of the day, Tday and earth-moon separation, Dem.  Note that 
you will find helpful the results of the CyberTutor problem on L(R) for a circular 
orbit.
