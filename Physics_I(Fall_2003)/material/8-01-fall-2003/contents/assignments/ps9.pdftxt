Due 4:00PM Thursday Nov. 06, 2003 

Topics: Rigid Body Rotation and Angular Momentum 

Any following problems designated with a bold number indicate problems from Young 
and Freedman 11th edition. 

1.  9.78 
2.  9.80 
3.  9.86  Do not solve this problem with the numerical values of the masses given â€“ call 
the masses M4, M2, and Mp (for the pulley) 
a)  Find the speed asked for  in the problem 
b)  Find the magnitude of the acceleration of the masses expressed in the units of g. 
c)  Find the magnitude of the acceleration of the masses in the case than Mp = 0 (i.e. for 
the case of the perfect pulley which you solved for earlier). 
d)  Exhibit a problem with two perfect pulleys and three connected (by strings) masses 
that has the same acceleration as the masses in this problem. 
4 .  10.35
