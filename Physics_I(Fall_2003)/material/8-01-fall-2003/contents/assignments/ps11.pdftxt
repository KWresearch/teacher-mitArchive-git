HOMEWORK #11  - 8.01 MIT - Prof. Kowalski 

Due 4:00PM Thursday Nov. 20, 2003 

Topics: Universal Gravity 

Any following problems designated with a bold number indicate problems from Young 
and Freedman 11th edition. 

Note: It may help to do some of the Mastering Physics assignment #12 on Universal 
Gravitation and Oscillators before doing some of these problems. 

1 .	 12.23  Hint: Calculate the orbiting speed first and picture what would happen if you 
started to walk slowly, gradually speeding up. 
b)  You could escape by jumping straight up.  On earth, a person’s jumping ability is 
measured by their “vertical leap” – the distance their c of m rises after they jump. 
What vertical leap on earth corresponds to escape velocity on Dactyl? 
2 .	 12.24 
3 .	 12.46 
4 .	 12.68 
e)  How many times as much energy (as your answer to part d) is required to actually 
make this payload dock smoothly with the space station? 
5 .	 12.70
