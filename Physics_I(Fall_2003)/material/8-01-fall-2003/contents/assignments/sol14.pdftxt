1)  37.20  Relativistic  Relative  Velocity 

Write  diﬀerential  form  of  Lorentz  transformation: 
x�  = γ (x − ut) 
t�  = γ (t − ux/c2 ) 
γ  =  �
1 
1 − u2/c2 
dx�  = γ (dx − udt) 

which  is: 

(1) 

dt�  = γ (dt − udx/c2 ) 
Divide  (2)  by  (1)  you’ll  get  (dx/dt = vx ): 
vx  − u 
v � = 
1 − uvx/c2 
x 
Where  u  is  the  velocity  of  the  moving  frame.  In  this  problem  you 
want  to  know  the  relative  velocity  so  it  means  that  your  moving 
frame has  the velocity of  one of  them and  in  this  frame you want  to 
know  velocity  of  the  other: 

(2) 

(3) 

vx  = 0.9520c 
u = −0.9520c 
Replace  this  into  equation  (3)  you’ll  get: 
0.9520c − (−0.9520c) 
1 − (0.9520c)(−0.9520c)/c2 

v � =
x 

= 0.9988c

rel  = 0

2)  37.44  Creating  a  Particle 

a) The  total  energy  of  a  particle  is: 

E  = mγ c 2 
�
Where m  is  the  rest mass  and 
1 
1 − u

γ  = 

2/c2

(4)

� 
Before  col lision  - incident  two  protons  -: 
E  = EP  + EP  = 2mP γP c 2 

� 
After  col lision  - two  protons +  new  particle  which  are  at  rest  -: 
E �  = EP  + EP  + Eη
�
�
�
0  = (2mP  + mη0 )c 2 
� 
From  the  energy  conservation : � 
E � 
E  = 
we  get: 

γ = 
P 

2mP  + mη0 
2mP 

With  the  numbers  given: 

From  (4): 

γ = 1.29

u/c = 1 −

With  the  γ we  found: 
P 

uP  = 0.632c 

b) The  kinetic  energy  is  the  diﬀerence  of  total  energy  and  the  rest 
energy: 

KP  = (γP  − 1)mP c 2 
Plug  in  the  numbers,  you’ll  get 

× 10−10
j 
KP  = 0.436 
Divide  it  by  e = 1.60 × 10−19  you’ll  get  the  energy  in  ”  eV”  units: 

c) Similarly  you  get: 

KP  = 273 MeV 

mη0 c 2  = 550 MeV 

d) Apart  from  the  ”error”  of  keeping  3  signiﬁcant  ﬁgures  you  may 
have  noticed  that  the  rest  energy  of  η 0  is  the  sum  of  both  protons 
energy,  KP .  This  is  indeed  expected  from  the  1 )  the  deﬁnition  of 
kinetic  energy  (diﬀerence  of  total  energy  and  rest  energy)  2 )  con­
servation  of  energy  3 )  the  ﬁnal masses  are  at  rest.

3)  37.71  The  Pole  and  Barn  Paradox 

The reason there is an apparent paradox  is that the notion of ﬁtting 
the moving  pole  into  the  barn  contains  an  implicit  assumption  that 
the  length  of  the  pole  (or  the  barn)  is  not  changed  by  their motion. 
Actually  the  length  of  a  moving  ob ject  contains  the  idea  of  simul­
taneity  - it  is  the  distance  between  the  ends  at  the  same  instant  of 
time.  Simultaneity  is  destroyed  by  special  relativity  - two  people 
who  have  a  relative  velocity will  not  agree  on what  is  simultaneous! 
Hence they can (and do) disagree about the relative size of pole and 
barn. 

This  paradox  is  often  sharpened  by  imagining  that  the  doors  of  the 
barn  are  suddenly  and  simultaneously  closed  by  the  farmer.  Seeing 
the  door  closing,  the  runner  stops.  Then  does  his  pole  ﬁt?  This 
introduces an extraneous element into the problem:  when the runner 
stops,  only  the  middle  of  the  pole  where  he  is  holding  it  stops  - so 
when  do  the  ends  stop?  In  reality  the  pole  will  break.  But  if  the 
ends  magically  stopped  simultaneously  in  the  frame  of  the  runner, 
the farmer would see the rear end of the pole stop while the front end 
kept  going.  When  the  pole,  which  to  the  farmer  appeared  shorter 
than  the  barn  while  moving,  stops  in  this  manner,  it  will  be  longer 
than the barn.  This conﬁrms the original opinion of the runner (who 
thought  the barn much  shorter  than his pole), but only because  the 
ends  stopped  simultaneously  in  the  frame  of  the  runner.

4)  37.72  Fizeau  Experiment 

From the relativistic addition of velocities discussed in the book and 
derived here (problem 1) we can apply them here.  Assume  light has 
velocity  c/n  in  the  direction  of  water’s  velocity,  V : 

v = 

c  + V 
c  + V
1 +  (c/n)V  =  n 
n 
1 +  V 
nc 
c2 
Therefore: 

V 
= (c/n+V )[1−  +O(V 2/c2 )] = c/n+V −V /n2+O(V 2/c2 )
nc 

v ∼
= (c/n) + (1 − 1/n2 )V
Where we  threw out O(V 2/c2 ) assuming  it’s very  small.  This  is  the 
same  as  the  given  formulae  with 
1 
k = 1 −  2n
With  the  n=1.333  you’ll  get: 

which  is  incredibly  close  to  the  experimental  value. 

k = 0.4372
