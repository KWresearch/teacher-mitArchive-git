Angular Energy and Angular Momentum.

1) 10.70

Please refer to figure 10.54 p.399.

The general strategy to solve this problem is to ﬁgure out the torque
around a point and the direction of the torque will tell you which
way it rotates.

Choose the z direction to be perpendicular to the plane shown in
the ﬁgure and pointing up. If the direction of the torque is up it
means that it rotates counterclockwise or it moves to the left. If the
direction of the torque is down it means that it rotates clockwise or
it moves to the right .

The smartest choice of the point you want to write the torque about
is the contact point with the ground because the torque due to
friction and normal force is Zero around this point since they are
acting at this point. Weight vector is also passing through this point
so it doesn’t generate any torque around it.
In the following calculation regard the contact point as origin:
−→
r contact point = 0
a) F to right; bottom of axle (# 1 ):
× −→

F ∝ − ˆz
r F c
τc =
−→
−→
−→
(Where c denotes the contact point;
τc : torque around the contact
point c;
r F c :
r to force from contact point) So it rotates to
−→
the right. Now if you write the torque around center of mass the
(cid:1) −→
only force that has torque around it is
f . Consider z component
of
τ cm about center of mass. To roll to right, torque must be
in −ˆz, since F gives a +ˆz torque, f (friction) must give −ˆz torque
hence points to left.

F to right; top of axle (# 2 ):
−→
τ c =

× −→
F ∝ − ˆz
So it rotates to the right. With the same argument friction can
point to the left(if axle radius is small) or to the right (if axle radius
is large).

−→
r F c

F points up; left of axle (# 3 ):
−→
−→
r F c
τ c =

× −→
F ∝ − ˆz
So it rotates to the right. Friction is the only force acting in hor-
izontal direction and is responsible from Newton’s second law in
horizontal direction for this acceleration so it points to the right.

b) From the deﬁnition:

−→
τ c =

× −→

r F c
F

There are three ways to make
τ zero: 1 )r=0; 2 )F=0; 3 )φ=0
−→
r F c and
F .) Here
(where φ is the angle between the two vectors
you don’t have r=0 or F=0. You can make the angle between them
Zero. This conﬁguration is shown in the ﬁgure 2.

c) Please see the right triangle shown in the ﬁgure two with the
indicated parameters.

sin α =

r
R

⇒ α = arcsin(

r
R

)

d) Let’s analyze the Newton’s law
(cid:2)

Fy = may = 0 ⇒ N − mg − F cos α = 0 ⇒ N = mg − F cos α

−→
F = m

a here:

So by increasing f you’ll decrease N. Because fmax = µsN you will
(cid:2)
also decrease fmax . Now if you write Newton’s law in the x direction:
Fx = max ⇒ F sin α − f = max
So as you pull harder, F increases and fmax decreases and you’ll
reach a point that f can not cancel completely F sin α and the Yo-
Yo starts to move to the left, but without rotating.

2) 10.78 Bal l rol ling down track over edge.

The assumption is there is no friction present here so:

Kh + Uh = Eh = E0 = K0 + U0

There two parts contributing to K: one is the rotation and the center
of mass motion.

b) x does not depend on g , so the result should be the same on the
moon.

c) No system is perfect: energy is lost to noise generation, crushing
dirt on the track air resistance, etc.

3) 10.87 Bul let hits pivot rod.
There is no external torque acting on the system of bullet plus rod
if you take torques about the pivot point, so that the forces on the
axle don’t generate any torque:

4) 10.101 Rol ling without slipping.

Please refer to ﬁgure 3. z is perpendicular to the plane and it’s
pointing up. Without loss of generality assume that the disk is
rotating counterclockwise. From the free body diagram shown in
the ﬁgure:(cid:2)

Fy = may = 0 ⇒ N − M g = 0 ⇒ N = M g
(cid:2)
Fx = M ax ⇒ fk = M ax

Combine (7), (8) and (9):

This acceleration is constant and from vx (t) = v0 + ax t we have

vx (t) = µk gt
(cid:2)
The equation for ω can be derived from:

τz = I αz

Where we write τz around the center of mass. Around this point

the only force that has torque is fk :

so that that relative distance of slipping of the coin edge and the
surface is a factor of 3 greater than x(T ).
