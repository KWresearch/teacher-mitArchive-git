HOMEWORK #7  - 8.01 MIT - Prof. Kowalski 

Due 4:00PM Thursday Oct. 23, 2003 

Topics: Potential Energy Curves, Momentum and Center of Mass 

Any following problems designated with a bold number indicate problems from Young 
and Freedman 11th edition. 

1.	 7.61 
2.	 7.68 
3.	 7.76  see the Mastering Physics review problem for Test #2 Work and Potential Energy 
on a Sliding Block with Friction which has several elements of similarity; so does the 
MP problem about shooting the mass up an incline with a spring gun. 
4.	 7.78  The “path” referred to in the problem is really the time-dependent position of 
the particle.  The key insight is to realize that the force is radial and independent of 
time; hence the potential is time independent. 
5.	 7.86
