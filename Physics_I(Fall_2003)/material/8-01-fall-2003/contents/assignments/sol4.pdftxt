The natural choice of axis is x and y which is along the incline and

(cid:1) −→
perpendicular to the incline respectively because there is no accel-
(cid:1)
eration and two forces ,
T and
N , out of 3 forces present are along
these axes. Writing
F = 0 for both masses:
Fx acting on B is 0 ⇒ TAB − w sin α = 0 ⇒ TAB = w sin α.

a)
Fx acting on A is 0 ⇒ TA − TAB − w sin α = 0 ⇒ TA =

w sin α + w sin α = 2w sin α.
Fy = 0 for both A and B. ⇒ NA − w cos α = 0 and NB −
c)
w cos α = 0 ⇒ NA = NB = w cos α.
2) 5.14

a) In level ﬂight, the thrust and drag are horizontal and the lift and
(cid:2)
weight are vertical. At constant speed, the net force is zero:
Fx = F − f = 0
(cid:2)

(1)

Fy = L − w = 0

(2)

so F=f and w=L.

b) When the plane attains the new speed, it is again in equilibrium
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
and so the new values of the thrust and drag, F
are related

a)
The tension is related to the masses and acceleration(it’s best to
take y up for both blocks) by
T − m1g = m1a1

(3)

T − m2g = m2a2
(4)
b)For the bricks, mass m1 , accelerating upward, let a1 = −a2 =
a(the counterweight will accelerate down at the same rate as m1
goes up since the string does not stretch). Subtracting the two
equations to eliminate T gives
(m2 − m1 )g = (m1 + m2 )a
28.0 − 15.0
m2 − m1
m1 + m2
15.0 + 28.0
c) The result of part b may be substituted into either of the above
expressions to ﬁnd the tension T=191 N. As an alternative the ex-
pressions may be manipulated to eliminate a algebraically by mul-
tiplying the equation (1) by m2 and the equation (2) by m1 and
adding (with a2 = −a1 ) to give

m1 + m2

In terms of the weights, the tension is

T = w1

2m1
2m2
m1 + m2
m1 + m2
If, as in this case, m2 > m1 , 2m2 > m1 + m2 and 2m1 < m1 + m2 .
So the tension is greater than w1 and less than w2 ; this must be the
case, since the load of bricks rises and the counter weight drops.

b)We should ﬁnd the maximum a
g from the graph which is around
(cid:2)
140. Similar to above calculations we get
Fy )max ≈ 294µN .
You can read the time that the function takes to reach its maximum
- which is around 140 - from the graph: Tmax ≈ 1.2 ms

(13)

(

c)The acceleration is always positive so the ﬂea adds to its speed
and the maximum speed is just the total area under the a(t) curve
or the total area A under the a/g v.s t curve times g. vmax = A × g .
The area of each square is 0.25 × 25 ms which times g (10 m/s2 )
gives approximately 60 mm/s. The next step is to count the number
of these squares which is around 21. So the maximum speed would
be 21 × 60 which gives 1260 mm/s, so vmax ≈ 1 m/s.

d)The ﬂea will accelerate at ay = −g for a time tH = vmax
g which is
≈ 120 ms. To accuracy 3 percent we can neglect the displacement
during the 1ms acceleration period. Using

vmin (Tmax ):

The friction will oppose the motion of the block inward and down
relative to the cone so ( from the free body diagram attached):

By eliminating N we get

vmin =

gh tan β

vmax (Tmin ):

cos β − µs sin β
sin β + µs cos β

(24)

The friction will oppose the motion of the block outward and up
relative to the cone. The free body diagram in this case gives us:
−mg − N µs cos β + N sin β = 0

The forces acting on the pulley is F upward and 2T downward and
because pulley is massless the
F acting on it should be zero so

T =

F

(31)

It’s crucial to understand that once you know F, T will be deter-
mined from the above equation. This simpliﬁes the problem into
two independent F=ma problem for each block i.e. the motion of
each block is unaﬀected by the motion of the other block.

wA = 200 N wB = 100 N.

a) T = F
2 = 62 N.
T is less than both wA and wB . A and B will stand on the ﬂoor
and the Normal forces NA and NB will compensate the diﬀerence
between w’s and the T.

b) T = F
2 = 147N which is greater than wB and smaller than
wA . We know that the normal force can’t be negative so B will
accelerate upward (the normal force becomes Zero) with accelera-
tion aB = T −wB
= 4.7m/s2 and for the same reason as part a; aA=0.
mB

c) T = F
2 = 212N which is greater than both wB and wA . So both
will accelerate upward with accelerations aB = T −wB
= 11.2m/s2
mB
and aA = T −wA
= 0.6m/s2 .

7) Three Masses and Two Pulleys

In scientiﬁc research it happens a lot that you will be given an an-
swer ,say, from a computer simulation and you need to know if that
answer makes sense or not. One typical way of doing it is to check
the answer in special cases which we know the answer.

M1= 0:
The right pulley will have a free fall. So the a1 = +g so c, e and f
are out.

M2= 0 :
M3 will have a free fall but TLL = TLR = 0 ⇒ a1 = −g . There is
an equivalent situation for M3= 0. So g and b are out.

The only option is d.

For another check; it should balance (with a=0) if

M2= M3= M1
2 = M:
2 = M g ⇒ a1 = 0 which is consistent with d
TLL = TLR = TL
