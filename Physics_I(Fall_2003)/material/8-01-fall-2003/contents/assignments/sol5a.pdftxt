Friction,  circular  dynamics,  and  Work-Kinetic  Energy. 

1)  5.80 

If  the  block  were  to  remain  at  rest  relative  to  the  truck,  the  fric-
tion  force  would  need  to  cause  an  acceleration  of  2.20  m/s2 ,  ;How-
ever,  the  maximum  acceleration  possible  to  to  static  friction  is 
(0.19)(9.80)=1.86  m/s2 ,  so  the  block  will  accelerate  relative  to  the 
� 
truck. 
Acceleration  a  with  respect  to  ground  is  (from 
Fx  = +µsmg  = 
mabox ): 

a = µk g = (0.15)(9.80) = 1.47m/s2 .

Please  refer  to  figure  (1).

Let’s  denote  the  common magnitude  of  acceleration  as  a.  If  block 
� −→ 
B  is  to  remain  at  rest  on A  ,  the  sum  of  forces  acting  on  B  should 
−→
produce  the  acceleration  a.  Setting  up  the  FB  = m a :

FBy  :  NAB  − mB g = 0 ⇒ NAB  = mB g

fs  = mB a ≤ µsNAB

NOTE: Here is a case in which friction causes positive acceleration. 

A: 

� 
FAy  :  NA  − NAB  − mAg = 0 ⇒ NA  = (mA  + mB )g 

(7) 

� 
FAx  :  T −µk NA − fs  = mAa ⇒ T  = µk g(mA +mB )+ (mA +mB )a 
(8) 

∴  T  = (mA  + mB )(a + µk g) 

(9) 

NOTE:  The  friction  force  between  block  A  and  B  is  LESS  THAN 
or  EQUAL  to  µsNAB .  We  don’t  know  it  yet  and  must  assign  it  an 
unknown  variable  fs .

FC y  = T  − mC g = mC aC y  = −mC a

C: 

Replacing  T  from  above  into  equation  (10)  and  solving  for  a: 
mC  − µk (mA  + mB ) 
a = g 
mA  + mB  + mC 

(11)

To  simplify  (6)  in  terms  of  a,  we  combine  (5)  and  (6): 
mB a ≤ µsmB g 

Using  (11): 

∴  a ≤ µsg 
mC  − µk (mA  + mB ) 
g 
mA  + mB  + mC 
Solving  the  inequality  for mC  gives: 
mC  ≤ 

(mA  + mB )(µs  + µk ) 
1 − µs 
.

3)  5.90 

Since  the  lower block has  less  coeﬃcient  of  friction  it will  accelerate 
more  rapidly  downward  in  the  absence  of  the  string.  However  the 
role  of  string  is  to make  them have  the  same  acceleration  by having 
the  tension  T.

Writing  equations  in  the  coordinate  system  which  x  is  parallel  to 
plane  and  pointing  up  and  y  perpendicular  to  plane  and  pointing 
away  from  it. 

Smaller mass: 

� 
FS y  = 0 ⇒ NS  − mS g cos θ = 0 

� 
FSx  = mS a ⇒ −mS g sin θ + NS µSk  + T  = mS a 

Larger mass: 

� 
FLy  = 0 ⇒ NL  − mLg cos θ = 0 

� 
FLx  = mLa ⇒ −mLg sin θ + NLµLk  − T  = mLa

a)Adding  these  two  equations  and  solving  for  a: 
(mS  + mL )g [cos θ(µS k  + µLk ) − sin θ ] 
mS  + mL 
a = g [cos θ(µS k  + µLk ) − sin θ] 
a = −2.21m/s2 . 
(22) 
b)Substituting  the  above  acceleration  in  either  of  (17)  or  (19)  gives 
T=2.27  N. 

substitution  gives 

(20) 

c)The upper block will slide down with more acceleration until they 
collide!  You  could  solve  this  section  with  the  above  formalism  and 
you  will  get  negative  T  which  means  that  the  string  must  be  a 
stiﬀ  rod  ,which  supports  compressive  forces,  in  order  to  prevent  the 
collision.

Make  sure  that  you  have  understood  Example  5.22  p.184.

The  net  force  inward  is 

Frad  = sin β TU  + sin β TL  = sin β  (TU  + TL ) = mar .

Using  hypotenuse  theorem  the  radius  of  oscillation  is

If  you  plug  in  the  above  numbers  into  equations  we  derived  you’ll 
get: 

(28) 

TL  = 31.0N . 

τ  = 1.334s 
so  the  system makes  1/0.02223 ≈  45  rev/min. 

(29) 

(30) 

c) When  the  lower  string  becomes  slack,  the  system  is  the  same  as 
the conical pendulum considered in Example  5.22 with cos β  = 0.8, 
� 
the  period  is 
(1.25)(0.80)
τslack  = 2π 
9.80 

= 2.007s. 

(31)

which  equivalent  to  30  rev/min. 

d)For  oscillation with  less  revolutions  the Tension  in  lower  string  is 
still  Zero  and  the  problem  is  again  the  conical  pendulum  problem; 
the  block  will  drop  to  a  smaller  angle.

b)  Using  the  deﬁnition

W  =  F . s  = F s cos φ 

(37) 

because  friction  is  always  against  the  relative  motion  in  this  case 
◦ 
φ = 180  : 
Wtot  = Wf  = Ff  (x1  − x0 )(−1) = −Ff  (x1  − x0 ). 
Using  the  result  of  part  a  we  have 
−Ff  (x1  − x0 ) = −  mv0

∴  tstop  =

d)Using  (32)

Here  Wtot  =  Wperson  + Wf  using  (35)  and  noting  that  s  =  x2  − x1

we  have Wf  = −Ff (x2  − x1 ).  Using  the  result  of  part  b  we  get

2 x2  − x1 
Wf  = −

Collecting  all  the  information  we  got  we  have

We  choose  the  x  axis  along  the  acceleration  so  we  have  0  accelera-

have  have  T  along  and  F  ⊥.  However  you  should  pro ject  a  and
