Rigid Body Rotation and Angular Momentum.

Please refer to figure 9.29 p.358.
(cid:1)

From the deﬁnition:

I =

r2⊥ dm

we observe that if an ob ject is more concentrated around the line
has less moment of inertia.(Of course this conclusion is not right if
they have diﬀerent masses)

a) The cylinder’s mass (ob ject A in the ﬁgure) is the most concen-
trated near its axis ⇒ Ob ject A has the smallest moment of inertia.

b) The cylinder with a hole has greater I than a cylinder (of the
same mass) but slightly less than a hoop. With the assumption that
it’s a thin cylinder we assume it’s very close to I of a hoop:
≈ M R2 .
The cube has moment of inertia Icube = 1
12 M (a2 + b2 ) = 2
3 M R2 which
is less than the thin cylinder. So, the thin cylinder (ob ject B in the
ﬁgure) has the largest moment of inertia.

Ithin cylinder

c) The sphere is more concentrated near its axis than even the
cylinder so it will replace solid cylinder as the smallest moment of
inertia.

The key to this problem is to set up the energy conservation equation
having in mind that no non-conservative force is present here:

K1 + U1 = E1 = E2 = K2 + U2

(1)

U of the disk will not change due to rotation around around its cen-
ter. There are two parts contributing to the kinetic energy: move-
ment of center of mass of the mass m, and of rotation of the disk:

Mass m is attached to the disk so it rotates with the same ω as the
disk:

v = Rω

Hence,

We will measure the gravitation potential energy with respect to the
height of the horizontal line passing through the center of the disk.

a) Let’s denote L for the left mass, R for the right and P for the
pulley. The key to this problem is to set up the energy conservation
equation having in mind that no non-conservative force is present
here:

KL1 + UL1 + KR1 + UR1 + KP1 = E1

= E2 = KL2 + UL2 + KR2 + UR2 + KP2

We will measure the gravitation potential energy with respect to the
ground. You don’t need to write UP because it’s constant through-

out this process.The length of the rope is constant so |vL

represents angular velocity of the pulley. The problem asks for V so

Using the rotational analogue of Newton’s second law:

τz = I αz

we get

T2R − T1R = IP α = IP ˙ω = IP

Writing Newton’s law

NOTE: The pulley does not contribute to the imbalance, but only
increases the inertia.

The result of part b shows that, the pulley does not contribute to
the imbalance, but only increases the inertia. This suggests the 1st
conﬁguration shown in the ﬁgure 2.
There are of course other possibilities:

By writing a as:

a = g

(mL + mP /4) − (mR + mP /4)
(mL + mP /4) + (mR + mP /4)
Which is the familiar result of two masses for ideal pulley problem
