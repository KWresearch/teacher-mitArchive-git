Topics: Harmonic Oscillators and Relative Motion 

Any following problems designated with a bold number indicate problems from Young 
th
and Freedman 11  edition. 

1.  Vibration Isolation System 

A heavy table of mass M is vibrationally isolated by being hung from the ceiling by 

springs so that its period of vertical oscillation is Z0 (take Z0 to be 2S/sec, a typical 
value).  Assume now that the ceiling vibrates vertically with amplitude A at frequency Z, 
i.e. yc(t) = A*cos(Z*t). 
1. 	 Write down the dynamical equation that relates the acceleration of the table a(t) to its 
position y(t), and the position of the ceiling. Although M and k will appear in this 

equation, you should be able to replace them with Z0.  Show that the equation you 
get this way is the same as if a force proportional to cos(Z*t) were acting on the mass 
– spring system. 

This system is referred to as a driven harmonic oscillator.  Its steady state solution is 
y(t) = C(Z)*cos(Z*t).  NOTE that it responds solely at the drive frequency Z, not at the 

natural frequency of the oscillator Z0.  (Actually there is also a transient at Z0 that fades 
away with time in a real system due to damping.) 
2. 	 By substituting the above expression for y(t) (and the a(t) that results from this) in 
your equation from part a, you should be able to obtain and solve a simple equation 
for C(Z). 
3. 	 With what amplitude, yt, will the table oscillate if the building (i.e. ceiling) oscillates 
with amplitude 0.01 cm at a (typical) frequency of 15 Hz?  This ratio is called the 
isolation factor at Z

	37.1  A double lightening bolt strikes opposite ends of a passenger car that is moving 
with speed v, lighting up the ends of the car simultaneously from the perspective of a 
rider in the middle of the car.  Which bolt appears to have come earlier to an observer 
on the ground, or do they appear simultaneous to him?

4. 	 Michelson-Morley Experiment with ether.  Michelson, and later Michelson and 
Morley used a Michelson interferometer mounted on a round granite block that 
floated on mercury in a surrounding tub.  Their experiment is shown above (drawing 
from http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/mmhist.html).  Michelson 
and most physicists of his generation imagined that light propagates through a 
transparent nearly massless but quite stiff (so the speed of the light relative to the 
ether is c=3*10^8 m/s) medium called the “ether”.  He thought his experiment would 
detect the motion of the earth through this ether. 
If this experiment is moving to the right at speed v, find the time difference for the 
light to traverse back and forth through the distance L in both the horizontal and 
vertical direction.  Hint: neither time is 2*L/c 
b.	 In the Michelson-Morley experiment, the light bounced back and forth several times 
for a total distance L=11m, and the travel time difference was measured as a shift of 
the interference pattern (where one fringe was 0.25 um).  What was the expected 
fringe shift when the apparatus was rotated through 90 degrees assuming that v is the 
velocity of the earth in its orbit?  (The observed fringe shift was less than 0.01 of a 
fringe.)
