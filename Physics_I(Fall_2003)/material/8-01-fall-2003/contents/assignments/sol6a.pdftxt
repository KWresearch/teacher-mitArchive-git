HW Solutions # 6 - 8.01 MIT - Prof. Kowalski

Potential Energy and Mechanical Energy Conservation.

NOTE: We made a mistake on the solution sheet for HW #5.
On part d of problem 5 on HW #5 we omitted the work due to
x2−x1
friction. If you submitted the answer 1

x1
have been graded correct, and you can recover any lost credit by
resubmitting it to your grader with a note to regrade this problem.

1) 7.42

Please refer to the figure 7.30 p.277.

Let’s denote the compression length as ∆x, the velocity after leaving
the spring as v0 and the maximum height it goes on the incline as h.

Using energy conservation law:

There is no friction present in this problem and Wother = 0. I will
measure the gravitation potential energy with respect to the height
of the dashed horizontal bar indicated in the ﬁgure 7.30.

a) Comparing the energy initially (when spring compressed):

v1 = 0 x1 = ∆x y1 = 0

with the point it leaves the spring:

b) For this part we should compare the energy of particle at its
highest point on the incline:

∴ v0 =

v3 = 0 x3 = 0 y3 = h

with the point that it has left the spring:

v2 = v0 x2 = 0 y2 = 0

the initial energy point)

Using (5):

The distance L it travels up the incline is just:

∴ h =

L =

sin θ

k(∆x)2

Plugging in the numbers given in the problem you’ll get:

∴ L =

v0 = 3.11 m/s

L = 0.821 m

Let’s denote the 0.500 kg rat as L and 0.200 kg one as S.
No non-conservative force is present in this problem and we can
safely use:

KS1 + US1 + KL1 + UL1 = KS2 + US2 + KL2 + UL2

Point 1 refers to the initial condition when it’s released from rest.
Pint 2 refers to the vertical situation. I will measure the gravitation
potential energy with respect to the height of the initial horizontal
bar.

vS1 = vL1 = 0

yS1 = yL1 = 0

(16)

If the animals are equidistant from the center, they have the same
speed V.

vS2 = vL2 = V

yS2 = +

yL2 = − l0

∴ 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 =

Following the hint (to express k in terms of m & d), when the ﬁsh
(cid:2)
is lowered slowly, it stops in equilibrium::
Fy = kd − mg = 0 ⇒ k =
mg
d
Let’s denote the maximum distance it reaches when it falls as dmax .
Again here no nonconservative force is present and we have:

NOTE: With a spring is easiest to pick y=0 at its unstretched
2 k(y − y0 )2 . We also take y>0 to
length - otherwise the energy is 1
be up.

Point 1 refers to the point it starts falling from rest and pint 2 as
the point it stops moving after it stretches the spring the amount
dmax . As a matter of convention I’ll pick the y1 we have released
our mass as the 0.

v1 = 0

y1 = 0
y2 = −dmax

∴ (

There are two solutions:

The trivial one:

dmax1 = 0
which results from the fact that the energy of the starting point is
equal to itself !

The other solution:

kdmax − mg = 0

dmax2 = dmax =

Replacing k from equation (21) we get:

dmax =

2mg

∴ dmax = 2d

This is not surprising - the ﬁsh oscil lates symmetrical ly about its
equilibrium position.

4) Bead Slides Around and Up Wire

Please refer to the figure in the problem set.

There is no non-conservative forces, so mechanical energy is con-
served. The thing to remember is that for a circular motion accel-
eration is radial and is equal in magnitude to v2
R .

Our ﬁrst job is to obtain v at diﬀerent points and look carefully what
(cid:3) −→
−→
radial at that point means and use the component of Newton’s law
F = m
a in the radial direction. As for convention I choose the
horizontal line shown at the bottom of the loop in the ﬁgure as the
0 of potential energy.

(47)

This is not surprising- in the absence of dissipation it rises to the
same height from which it was released.

You could have chosen any two points you want between which to
apply energy conservation since energy is conserved along the entire
path. Let’s do this part by comparing points d and c:
