1) 12.23

Escaping From Asteroid

Please study example 12.5 "from the earth to the moon".
(cid:1)
a) The escape velocity derived in the example (from energy conser-
vation) is :

vesc =

2GmA
RA

(1)

Where:
mA ≡ Asteroid’s mass=3.6×1012 kg
RA ≡ Asteroid’s radius=700 m
G = 6.673 × 10
−11 Nm2/kg2
Plugging in these numbers into equation (1):

vesc = 0.83 m/s

You can certainly walk that fast on earth. However, you could not
√
walk on the asteroid faster and faster to achieve this speed because
you would go into orbit at a lower velocity (vesc /
2) at which point
the normal force of the ground would be zero so there would be no
more friction to accelerate you!

To get a feeling of how small this gravity is let’s do some estimation
of the time it takes to reach this velocity on the asteroid. The
gravitational force Fg = GmAm/R2
A on the surface of planet for a
mass, m ∼ 100 kg is ∼ 0.05 N. Let’s take µ = 1. The friction would
be ∼ 0.05 N so the acceleration a ∼ 0.05/100 = 0.0005 m/s2 and
the time t it takes to reach vesc = 0.83 m/s is:
= 1660 s ∼ 30 min
t ∼ 0.83
0.0005

b) The question is about the comparison with vertical leap on earth.
Using:
− v 2
0y = −2gearth d

v 2

we have:

v 2
≈ 0.03m

d ≈ 3cm
Even octogenarians can jump ∼ 10 × this length.

2) 12.24 Satellite’s altitude and mass

mS := Satellite’s mass.
mE := Earth’s mass.
R := The distance between the center of earth and satellite.
Fg :=the gravitational force between the two masses.
U := the gravitational energy between the two masses.

a) Fg and U are given. By writing them in terms of mS and mE :

Fg =

GmEmS
R2
U = − GmEmS
R

(2)

(3)

you can eliminate R:

R = − U
(4)
Fg
With the numbers given in the problem (F=19.0 kN; U=−1.39×1011
J) you’ll get:

R = 7.31 × 106 m
To ﬁnd the altitude above the earth denoted by H you should sub-
tract it from Earth radius:
H = R − RE = 7.31 × 106 − 6.38 × 106 = 9.3 × 105 m
H = 9.3 × 105 m
b) You can use the value of R and use either of (2) or (3) to ﬁnd
mS :

mS = − RU
GmE
Where mE = 5.97 × 1024 kg:
mS = 2.55 × 103 kg

3) 12.46 Gravitation from 3 masses

Let’s use three indices appropriate for 3 masses namely:
Right ≡ the mass at (0.5m, 0): rP R = 0.5m; mR = 1.0 kg.
Up ≡ the mass at (0,0.5m): rP U = 0.5 m; mU = 1.0 kg.
√
Diagonal ≡ the mass at (0.5m,0.5 m): rP D = 0.5
2 m; mD = 2.0 kg.
a) Because of symmetry we expect to get the total F acting on P
along the diagonal. We it more more generally though.

The three forces acting on mass P at origin are (FP R
P from R):

b) Use energy conservation

K2 + U2 = K1 + U1

(5)

where 1 denotes the situation that mass P is 300m far away from
origin. U1 is practically ”zero” at this large distance. (this distance
is 2 orders of magnitude larger so within 1% approximation you can
ignore U1 :

K1 = 0 U1 ≈ 0

(6)

Plugging the given numbers into (6):
v2 = 30.2 ± 0.3 µm/s

v2 ≈ 30 µm/s
NOTE: Gravity is a very weak force (e.g. compared with electro-
static forces), even if it had the speed v2 for the entire journey, it
would take ∼ 1 year to make this trip. In In fact it will take ∼ 1
year if no other forces (e.g. from sunlight forces) come into play.

3) 12.68 Gravitational Potential

a) From the deﬁnition given the units of φ is the unit of energy
]” to denote the units:
divided by mass.We use the convention ”[

[φ] =

=

[m][v 2 ]
[U ]
[m]
[m]
b) The gravitational potential energy of two masses m and mE sep-
arated by a distance r (assuming Zero energy at inﬁnity separation)
is:

= [v 2 ] = m2/s2

From the ”deﬁnition ”

we get:

U = − GmEm
r

φ =

U
m

φ(r) = − GmE
r

(7)

c) The problem asks for the quantity
∆φ = φ(RE + H ) − φ(RE ).
Where H denotes the altitude of the space station (400 km in this
problem).

Using:
G = 6.673 × 10
−11 Nm2/kg2 .
mE = 5.97 × 1024 kg.
RE = 6.38 × 106 m.
H = 400 × 103 m.

You’ll get:

∆φ = 3.68 × 106 m2/s2

d) If you assume that the initial and ﬁnal velocities are ”Zero”
which is equivalent to a very gradual process. Using

Ki + Ui + Wlif t = Kf + Uf

Here Ki = Kf = 0 and Wlif t is the work that must be done against
the gravity:

Wlif t = Uf − Ui = m∆φ
Using m=15,000 kg and the result of part (c) you’ll get:
∆U = 5.53 × 1010 J

W

e) To dock, you have to get up to the speed of the orbiting space
station. So the Kf should be its ﬁnal Kinetic energy as an orbiting
payload. For a circular orbit we have: Kf = − Uf

3) 12.70 Effect of Air Drag on Satellite’s Motion

a) In moving to a lower orbit by whatever means, gravity does pos-
itive work, and so the speed does increase.

b) From Calculus you know that for a general function f (r) we
have:

f (r − ∆r) = f (r) − df (r)
dr
Where ∆r is much smaller than r ( ∆r
r

∆r ⇒ ∆f = − df (r)
dr
(cid:7) 1).

∆r

(8)

From the expression for v(r) in circular motion:
(cid:1)

d(rα )
dr
Combined with (8) you’ll get:

(9)

v(r) =

GmE
r
= −αrα−1
(cid:1)
∆v = +(∆r/2)

GmE
r3 > 0

Combining K = 1/2mv 2 with (8) and (9) you’ll get:

∆K = +

GmEm
2r2 ∆r > 0

Combining U == − GmE m
with (8) and (9) you’ll get:
r
∆U = − GmEm
r2 ∆r

∆U = − GmEm
r2 ∆r = −2∆K
Total energy is E = K + U so:
∆E = ∆K + ∆U = ∆K − 2∆K = −∆K
W = ∆E = −∆K < 0

c) Since ∆r=50 km is much smaller than RE itself so you can safely
use equation (8) for functions v , K and U . For the rest you should
just plug in the numbers and use:
r = RE + H = 6.38 × 106 + 300 × 103 = 6.68 × 106 m.
∆r = 50 × 103 m.
m = 3000 kg.

GmEm
∆K = +
∆U = −2∆K = −1.34 × 109 J
W = −∆K = −6.70 × 108 J

As the term ”burns up” suggests, the energy is converted to heat or
is dissipated in the collisions of the debris with the ground.
