Please review section 8.6 rocket Propulsion in the book.
a) The average thrust is impulse devided by time:

Fave =

So the ration of the average thrust to maximum thrust is:

of ”rocket science”:

With m = m0 − ∆m and v0 = 0 we have:

Sensible: The height varies quadratically with the velocity, and is
independent of mass. Therefore halving the velocity decreases the
height by 4.

from which v2 = 1.01 × 103 m/s substitution of this into either of
the momentum relations gives v1 = 221m/s.
All that is known is that there is no z component of momentum,
and so only the ratio of speeds can be determined:
mBavBa − mK r vK r = 0 ⇒ vK r =

mBa
mK r

vBa

We don’t know what the vBa is. However if we know the the released
energy (it would be etermined from the difeerence of the masses
of these nuclei using the formula E = ∆mc2 ) you can set up the
energy conservation equation . Combined with vK r = mBa
vBa
mK r
we have 2 equations and two unknowns (we have already found v1
and v2 from momentum conservation) and in principle you can solve
for vK r and vBa .

Please review section 8.6 rocket Propulsion in the book.

a)
Consider system of plane + chunk of stationary air of ∆m, immedi-
ately in front of the propeller. Use coordinate system in which air
is initially at rest:

P1 = mP vP + dm(0) = mP vP

After passing through the propeller the air chunk has:
vair = vP − vex < 0

(23)

(24)

(Analogous to vf uel in the book section 8.6). Here:

P2 = mP (vP + dvP ) + dmvair

(25)

We ignore external force (e.g. air drag)in the system . So P2 = P1
and hence:

mP vP = mP (vP + dvP ) + dmvair

(26)

(vP − vex )
dmP

This process accelerates the plane, and from an engineering perspec-
tive we can regard the air as generating a force on the plane:

b) With the numbers given in the problem, the velocity that the
propeller imparts to the air is:

d) If the diameter of the propeller were halved, the area would be
1/4 so does the dm/dt would be one fourth. We want to have the

same net force and from part a you see that vair = vP
be multiplied by 4. This will increase the denominator, so doing
this will decrease the eﬃciency :

It’s better to make them bigger. You can’t make it too big though
because turbulence will become more and more important.
