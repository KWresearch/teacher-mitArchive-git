This is just a vector algebra problem and the problem is not inter-
ested in dynamics. The vector here is the force!

b) Fy = F sin θ = Fx tan θ = 34.6 N.

c) The problem in part a and b is not interested in the force along
or perpendicular to the ground. So, as long as we don’t change the
angle with respect to the ramp the answer to part a and b would
not change.

The train accelerates the eastward direction. So the acceleration
a is east, which is ˆx in the ﬁgure. Because the ball is at rest in the
−→
train its net acceleration in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame is
just the
a .

So according to Newton’s
F = m
direction should be positive.
Pay attention to the fact that this law should be written in the rest
frame so writing this law in the train frame is NOT allowed because
the train accelerates.

The next step is to analyze the forces to see in which conﬁguration

−→
Newton’s law will be fulﬁlled. The only forces present in this prob-
lem is gravity
W and tension
T .

We should see in which conﬁguration we get a net force in +x di-
−→
rection. Since gravity has no component in x direction the analysis
is simple and the direction of
T will tell us the direction in which
direction the ball accelerates as shown in the ﬁgure.

The lunch box is at rest in the bus frame so it is moving with the
same
v as the bus.
The analysis of this problem is similar to example 5.22. So make
sure ﬁrst that you have understood that example.
Using the free body diagram I write Newton’s second law in the
direction toward center and the direction perpendicular to ground
and certainly in an inertial frame.

There are only two forces present We have:
T and m
g . In the inertial frame there is no motion in the direction
⊥ to the plane of rotation.
a⊥ = 0 ⇒ T cos θ = mg ⇒ T = mg

We have a central acceleration ac = v2
R for the circular motion and
the only force that has component in the central direction is T with
Tc = T sin θ = mar = m v2
R .

The constraint in this problem is the fact that the rope does not
−→
stretch or shrink. So the acceleration
aL of mass 4.00 kg should
aR of mass 6.00 kg.It’s also clear that
be equal to the acceleration
there is no acceleration in y direction so the gravity is being can-
celled by the normal force from the ground.
