Universal Gravity and Harmonic Oscillators.

Whither the Moon?

1)
a) TIDES: The water (and to some extent the liquid core) of the
earth bulge out toward and away from the moon to the fact that its
gravitational attraction is stronger on the side of the earth toward
the moon than on the center of the mass of the earth itself, so the
water is pulled up relative the earth. On the far side of the earth
(away from the moon) the moon’s gravitational force is weaker and
this water is left behind this accelerating earth, producing another
tidal bulge. Therefore there are two high tides per day (in most
places on the earth).
The height of the tide is scaled by ∼ atidal

atidal = ∆gmoon = GMm (
(Dem + Re )2
Where Dem = 3.84 × 108 m.
This produces tides about 1 m high (Since Re = 6.378 × 106 m) in
mid-ocean but it can be magniﬁed by over an order of magnitude
by resonances with bays like the Irish Sea and the Bay of Fundy.

There are no torques on the earth moon system, so its total angular
momentum is conserved:

As the earth rotates underneath the tidal bulges, energy is lost.
The angular momentum of the earth decreases as well. Moreover,
the tides are carried along by the earth rotation. This means that
the bulge closer to the moon pulls the moon ahead in its orbit, in-
creasing the angular momentum of the moon.

The initial angular momentum is:

emωm = MmD2
Li = Ieωe+MmD2
emωm (1+

) = 1.203 MmD2
emωm

Note that the spin angular momentum of the earth is much smaller
than that of the moon in its orbit.

b) FINAL CONFIGURATION:
The tidal dissipation will slow the earth until one of two things hap-
pens:

1)The moon is driven away from the still spinning earth.
2)The earth slows until one side faces the moon all the time. At this
point the length of the day and the length of the lunar month will
be the same.

The actual outcome is # 2 due to the much smaller angular mo-
mentum of the earth’s spin relative to the moon’s orbital angular
momentum. The ﬁnal angular momentum is easy to ﬁnd as the
earth-moon system all rotates at ωf and so one simply needs the
combined moment of inertia:

Lf = (Ie + MmD2
f )ωf
In fact one can approximate the ﬁnal angular momentum by neglect-
ing the ﬁnal angular momentum of the earth to ﬁrst approximation:
Lf ≈ MmD2
f ωf

From:

We get:

From Kepler ’s law

With the information given in this problem you can ﬁnd the period
of the vertical mass-spring system in terms of L and g. The mass
has been moved down slowly so the ﬁnal stretched length is also the
