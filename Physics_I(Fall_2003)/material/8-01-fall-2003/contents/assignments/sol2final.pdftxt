1) 1.38

Please refer to figure 1.26 p.35.

To add the several vector displacements, we use components, refer-
ring to east and north instead of x and y. The net northward dis-
placement is 2.6 + (3.1) (sin 45 ) =+ 4.8 km, and the net eastward
(cid:1)
displacement is (4.0)+ (3.1) (cos 45 ) = + 6.2 km. The magnitude of
(4.8)2 + (6.2)2 = 7.8 km, using Pythago-
the net displacement is
ras’ theroem. To ﬁnd the direction, note that the ratio of northward
to eastward displacement is the tangent of the angle with the east
axis: arctan( 4.8
6.2 ) = 38 noth of east.

* The total displacement is a vector starting from the starting point
towards the end. By sketching the vectors to scale you’ll see the
agreement with the method of components.

2) 1.70

Please refer to figure 1.32 p.37.

The displacement vectors of the three legs must sum up to give the
total observed displacement. This vector equality provides TWO
equations, one for each component - the net x displacement should
be 5.80 km and the net y displacement should be 0:

The third leg must take the sailor east the distance: (5.80) - (3.50)
cos 45 - (2.00) = 1.33 km and a distance north (3.5) sin 45 = 2.47 km.
(cid:1)
⇒ magnitude of the displacement is
(1.33)2 + (2.47)2 = 2.81 km
and the direction arctan( 2.47
1.33 ) = 62north of east.

Please refer to figure 1.28 p.35.

Method : (Product of magnitudes × cos θ)
The angles must be found from the ﬁgure.
A.B = AB cos θAB = (12 × 15) cos 93 = −9.4m2
B.C = BC cos θBC = (15 × 6) cos 80 = +15.6m2
C.A = CA cos θCA = (12 × 6) cos 173 = −71.5m2

4) 1.52

The problem as initially posed was ambiguous as to which ﬁgure
was referred to.” Either of these solutions will be graded as correct.

Method: The vectors in problem 1.52 are in the x-y plane, so the
cross product will result in a vector in the z-direction. The general
formula is just the z-component of Eq. 1.26: (AxBy − AyBx ) ˆk.
a) A × B = (AxBy − AyBx ) ˆk = (−2 × −3 − 2 × 6) ˆk = −6 ˆk
b) A × B = (AxBy − AyBx ) ˆk) = (3 × 6 − 10 × 5) ˆk = −32 ˆk
c) A × B = (AxBy − AyBx ) ˆk = (−4 × 14 − 7 × 2) ˆk = −70 ˆk

Alternate Solution - Please refer to figure 1.28 p.35.

Method : (Magnitude: Product of magnitudes × sin θ
Direction: right-hand rule)
A × B = AB sin θAB (− ˆk) = (12 × 15 × sin 93 )(− ˆk) = −179.8 ˆk m2
B × C = BC sin θBC (− ˆk) = (15 × 6 × sin 80 )(− ˆk) = −88.6 ˆk m2
C × A = AC sin θCA (+ ˆk) = (6 × 12 × sin 173 )( ˆk) = 8.77 ˆk m2

The natural time and length scales in the speeding up and braking
process is s and ft respectively.

Useful conversions:
1mi= 5280 ft
60×60 ft/s = 1.46 ft/s ⇒ 1 ft/s = 1
1mph= 5280
1.46 =0.68 mph
Eq.1: x(t) = x(t0 ) + v(t0 )(t − t0 ) + 1
2 a(t − t0 )2
Eq.2: v(t) = v(t0 ) + a(t − t0 )
Eq.3: v 2 (t) − v 2 (t0 ) = +2a[x(t) − x(t0 )]

Take the direction of motion as the positive x-direction.

a)
Speeding up :
2 a+ (19.9)2 ⇒ a+ = +6.67
Eq.1 ⇒ .250 × 5280 = 0 + 0 × (19.9) + 1
ft/s2

Braking:
Eq.3 ⇒ 02 − (60.0 × 1.46)2 = 2 a− 146 ⇒ a− = −26.28 ft/s2
√
b) Eq.3 ⇒ v 2 −02 = 2 a+ ∆x ⇒ v =
2 × 6.67 × .250 × 5280 = 133
ft/s = 90 mph The discrepancy with actual ﬁnal speed shows that
the motion is not with constant acceleration. The acceleration be-
comes less and as the car speeds up. Therefore, the car quickly
comes up to 45 or 50 mph, hence it travels further than if it in-
creased its speed more slosly at ﬁrst.
c) Eq.2 ⇒ 0 − 60 × 1.46 = 2(−26.28)∆t ⇒ ∆t = 1.7s

* It’s good to pay attention to the fact that our results make sense.

Let the height be h and denote the 1.30 s interval as ∆t and the time
it takes the boulder to fall from the top of the cliﬀ to the ground as
t. For sign convenience I consider the downward direction as posi-
tive.

...it takes ∆t for the boulder to fall the last 1/3 of the way to the
ground. ⇒ ... it takes (t − ∆t) for the boulder to fall 1 − 1

that the boulder was already at 2/3 h! This would correspond to an
ob ject initially at 1/3 of the height of the cliﬀ being thrown upward
and taking 1.30s to rise to the top and fall to the bottom. Clearly
the problem is not interested in this case.

Indoor Cannon

Let’s ﬁrst summarize the standard pro jectile problem ignoring the
ceiling.
The change in vy comes from the gravity. It takes the y-component
of velocity from v0y to -v0y by symmetry. So the total time that the
ball is in the air - before hitting the ground - is
(−v0y )−(+v0y )
2v0y
ttotal =
=
g During this time the ball has a motion
−g
with a constant velocity , i.e. v0x , in x direction so the range is
2v0x v0y
R = v0x ttotal =
g

v0x = v0 cos α
v0y = v0 sin α
2 sin α cos α = sin 2α

⇒ R = v2
0 sin2α
g
So the maximum range is obtained for αmax = 45 which is v2
g .
0

In the presence of the ceiling, the maximum height the ball reaches
- deﬁned as h - should be less than H. Otherwise the ball would hit
the ceiling.

The next step is to ﬁnd h for αmax = 45 :
Pay attention again that the top point corresponds to vy = 0 .
Consider Eq. 3 of the problem 5 in the y direction. (hmax : the h
corresponding to αmax )
0y = 2(−g)h ⇒ hmax = v2

tained at α = 45 .
4gH ⇒ vcrit =
4gH
b) For v > vcrit we should set the angle in such a way to have
vy = 0 at y=H. Otherwise the ball will hit the ceiling which we
want to avoid. I represent this vy as ˜vy . Again using Eq. 3 of the
√
problem 5 along y direction we get:
˜vy =
2gH
This gives the y-component of the initial velocity. We need the
