a) Let’s denote the table displacement from equilibrium with Y .
fy = may for the box will read:
The Newton’s second law
d2Y
dt2 = k(y − Y )
Where y denotes the displacement of ceiling from the situation that
table is in equilibrium. The form of y is given:

(1)

M

y = A cos ωt

M

Replace this in (1) you’ll get:
d2Y
dt2 = −kY + kA cos ωt
Which is equivalent to an additional force - other than the spring
-kA cos ωt acting on the table.
b) Substitute Y = C (ω) cos ωt in (1) and divide two sides by M:
0 (A − C (ω)) cos ωt
−ω 2C (ω) cos ω t = ω2
Where I used the fact that k
M = ω2
0 .

This gives:

C (ω) =

A
1 − ω2
ω2
0
c) Set ω0 ∼ 2π Hz and ω = 15 × 2π Hz
∼ −0.005

So the amplitude is reduced by a factor ∼ 200.

2) 13.88 A Rod’s Oscillation via Spring

Please refer to the figure 13.88. There is a horizontal force
which acts at the end of the metal rod which points to the left and
it comes from the stretched spring. The magnitude of this force for
small θ is k(l/2)θ .

3) 37.1 Simultaneity

Please refer to the figure (37.4).
The person is in the middle of sparks, but moves to the right. If
the sparks were simultaneous to the ground observer she would en-
counter the light from the right hand end sooner than the light
from the left. She sees them simultaneously - therefore the left side
sparked ﬁrst if viewed from the ground’s perspective.

You can do it alternatively using Lorentz transformation :

Use the Lorentz coordinate transformation derived from relativity
principles:
= γ (t − ux/c2 )
t(cid:1)

1
Where γ =
1−u2 /c2 .
This transformation is linear so you can easily write:
B − t(cid:1)
A = γ [(tB − tA ) − u(xB − xA )/c2 ]
t(cid:1)
The condition given is that events A and B is simultaneous in the
(cid:1)
”
” frame so:

(2)

given condition :

B − t(cid:1)
t(cid:1)
A = 0
Combine this condition with (2) you’ll get:
tB − tA = u(xB − xA )/c2
Here the xB − xA > 0 (not ≥ !)
so tB − tA > 0 which means
that ﬁrst the events in the rest frame is NOT simultaneous and sec-
ond events A (which is at the left end of the train) will occur sooner.

NOTE: If you want to be more rigorous you can use the Lorentz
transformation in

x = γ (x(cid:1)

+ ut)

and consequently
B − t(cid:1)
B − x(cid:1)
xB − xA = γ [(x(cid:1)
A ) + u(t(cid:1)
A )]

3

B − t(cid:1)
Use t(cid:1)
A = 0 you’ll get:
B − x(cid:1)
xB − xA = γ (x(cid:1)
A ) = γL
Where L is the length of the train as seen by a person in the train.
So the rigorous result is:

tB − tA =
uγL
c2
Note as u increases γ increases and so does tB − tA so the events
become more and more non-simultaneous.

From the ﬁgure (2) and using hypotenuse theorem we have:

c you’ll get:

∆tx =

So we have:

δ t = ∆tx − ∆ty =

δL = δ tc = Lv 2/c2
From optics we know that the fringe shift Φ = δL/λ where λ is the
spacing of fringes in the experiment, λ = 0.25µ

Observed fringe shift is 2 × this., since x ↔ y applies the shift one
way and then the other.

Φobserved = 0.88
