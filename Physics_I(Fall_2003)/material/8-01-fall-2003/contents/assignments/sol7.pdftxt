a) First obtain the kinetic energy - denote it as Kh - as if he stepped
oﬀ the platform: When he stepped of a distance h ≤ d, Wother=0
because of negligible air resistance the energy conservation implies:

0 + mgh = Kh + 0
(3)
For the case he slides down the pole Wother after moving down the
(force opposes the motion ⇒ W is <
o
distance d is just faved cos 180
0):

Wother = −faved
The next step is to calculate Kinetic energy when he slides down
the pole and as it’s said make it equal to Kh :

(4)

0 + mgd + Wother = Kd + 0

(5)

Combining equation (4) with equations (2) and (3) and Kd = Kh :
mgd − faved = mgh

(6)

Therefore:

fave = mg(1 − h
d

)

When h = d, f = 0 ; as expected: when there is no friction sliding
down the pole has the same eﬀect as stepping oﬀ the platform.

And when h=0 we expect fave = mg which is consistent with what
we derived.

b) Plugging the numbers give in the problem into the boxed equa-
tion:

fave = 75.80 × (1 − 1
2.5

) = 441 N.

(7)

c) Let’s denote v at position y as v(y) Again setting up the equation
(1) -energy conservation- :
v1 = 0 y1 = d Wother = −fave (d − y)

(8)

v2 = v(y)

y2 = y

mv(y)2 + mgy

∴ 0 + mgd − mgfave (d − y) =

mv(y)2 = (mg − fave )(d − y)

When y = 0, v =
2gh, which is the original condition. When
y = d, v = 0: the ﬁrman is at the top of the pole.

Please refer to figure 7.40 p.279.

I use the index θ for the energy of the block at θ and index 0 for
the initial point and l the length the spring is stretched.I will
measure the gravitation potential energy with respect to the height
of the dashed horizontal bar indicated in the ﬁgure 7.40. The energy
conservation:

Kθ + Uθ = K0 + U0 + Wother

I the block is moved slowly, the kinetic energy can be taken as
constant:

K0 = Kθ = K

v0 = vθ

l0 = 0 y0 = 0

(15)

(16)

lθ = aθ (the leng th of the arc)

yθ = a sin θ

(17)

Wother here is WF and kinetic energy is same on both sides:

K + 0 + 0 + WF = K +

k(aθ)2 + mga sin θ

Using energy conservation:

Where x is compression of spring along incline, y is height, s is
distance travelled along the ramp. Measure the gravitation potential
energy with respect to the height of the horizontal bar passing from
its initial position(when it’s compressed).

(20)

v1 = 0

x1 = x y1 = 0

x2 = 0 y2 = s sin α

(21)

(22)

(x2 = 0 because the box will leave the spring and there will be no
energy associated with spring after box leaving it.)

So our energy conservation equation (20) becomes

kx2 + 0 + Wother = K2 + 0 + mg sin α

(cid:2)
Applying Newton’s law in the direction perpendicular to the ramp:

(23)

(cid:2)

F⊥ = ma⊥ = 0
F⊥ = N − mg cos α = 0 ⇒ N = mg cos α

fk = N µk = µkmg cos α

fk is against the relative motion of the box so

Minimizing the speed is equivalent to minimizing K2 . Hence and
diﬀerente the above expression with respect to α and set dK2

a) To apply Newton’s law
a for ﬁnding the components
F = m
of the force we should ﬁnd the components of acceleration by twice
diﬀerentiating:
The x & y positions:

x(t) = x0 cos ω0

y(t) = y0 sin ω0

This gives:

So we have:

ax =

dt2 = −x0ω2
d2x
0 cos ω0 t
dt2 = −y0ω 2
d2y
0 sin ω0 t
0 cos ω0 t = −ω2
Fx = max = −mx0ω2
0 x(t)

Note: This is the potential energy of a spring in two dimensions
with k = mω 2
0 .

b) The force is conservative so the energy is conserved:

E = K (x, y) + U (x, y) = const.

(39)

The next step is to ﬁnd K(x,y):

vx =

From the for of x(t) and y(t) we have:

5) 7.86

Please refer to figure 7.43 p.281.

Force is related to the potential energy by:
Fx (x) = − dU
dx
Sign of dU
dx can be read from the slope of U(x) at point x.

(53)

a) The slope of the curve U(x) is negative at A, so Fx is positive.

b) The slope of the curve U(x) is positive at B, so Fx is negative.

c) The force is conservative so the energy U+K=const. Therefore
the kinetic energy is maximum when potential energy is a minimum
and that appears to be around 0.75 m:
M ax{K } → M in{U } =⇒ x ≈ 0.75m
d) The curve at point C looks pretty close to ﬂat, so the force is
zero.

(54)

e) You may want to review problem 4 part c of HW #6. The ob ject
had zero kinetic energy at point A, and in order to reach a point
with more potential energy U(A) -due to energy conservation the
kinetic energy would need to be negative. Kinetic energy is never
negative, so the ob ject can never be at any point where the potential
energy is larger than U(A). On the graph that seems to be at about
2.2 m.

f ) The points of relative minimum in U(x) curve are stable equi-
librium points. One of them is the one we found in part c the other
is at x≈ 1.8 m.

e) The points of relative maximum in U(x) curve are unstable
equilibrium points.
the only potential maximum, and hence the
only point of unstable equilibrium is at point C which is about 1.4
m.
