The following problems are from Young and Freedman 11  edition. 

1.  1.38 

2.  1.70 

3.  1.50 

4.  1.52 
Find the vector product of the three vector pairs given in this problem (1.52). 
5.  2.27 

6.  2.98 

7. IndoorCannon 
A toy cannon is placed on the floor of a large room with a ceiling whose height is H.  The 

cannon fires its ball with speed v0.  The objective in this problem is to give an analytic 

expression for the farthest that the cannon can shoot (at the optimized angle) without 

having the ball hit the ceiling. 

a)  Below a certain v0, call it vcrit the presence of the ceiling does not affect the 

maximum range of the cannon.  Find the range and the v0 at which the ceiling first 
limits the range. 

b)  Above vcrit the ceiling limits the range.  Find the range, R(H), in this regime. 

c)  How much does a ceiling with H = 5m restrict the range of a cannon with v0 = 20 
m/s? Find the distance lost, Rlost
