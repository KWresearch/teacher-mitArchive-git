Due 4:00PM Thursday Oct. 30, 2003 

Topics: Momentum and Collisions 

Any following problems designated with a bold number indicate problems from Young 
th
and Freedman 11  edition.

5. 

	8.55 
	8.73 
	8.70 
	8.99  Do not solve this problem completely.  Rather state what laws apply with words 
and why; then write down the corresponding equations and outline a plan of solution. 
A sample plan of attack might be: “Solve the two linear Eqs. 1 and 3 for v3 and v1 in 
terms of v0 and E0; then plug these into Eq. 2 to find X in terms of the energy 
released (which was not given in the problem)” 
	8.106 do parts a and b, and then these parts: 
c. 	 Work put into the propeller goes several places: into work done on the plane, 
kinetic energy of the air left behind the path of the plane, and turbulence in the air 
(small eddies, etc.).  Under the assumption that the work put into turbulence is 
negligible, find the maximum possible efficiency (ratio of work done on plane to 
work done on propeller by the engine) of the propeller in this case. 
d. 	 If the diameter of the propeller were halved, what would the maximum possible 
efficiency be now?
