Homework will consist of Exercises and Problems.  Exercises are  generally more conceptual and 
require less number crunching. Exercises often require writing sentences to explain what you have 
learned. Written solutions should be submitted for both Exercises and Problems. 

Exercise 1.  According to the random walk model, solute molecules move and thereby diffuse be­
cause of collisions with water molecules.  Solute collisions with other solute molecules are gener­
ally ignored under the assumption that the water molecules vastly outnumber the solute molecules.

To get a  feeling for  the validity of  this assumption, and  to appreciate  the number of particles and

spatial  scales  involved,  consider  the  diffusion  of  potassium  ions  in  the  cytoplasm of  a  red  blood

cell.  Assume that the volume of  the cell  is 90 fL, and  that the concentration of potassium ions in

the cytoplasm is 150 mmol/L.

Part a. Estimate the number of potassium ions in the cytoplasm of the cell.

Part b. Estimate the average distance between potassium ions in the cell.

Part c. Estimate the number of water molecules in the cytoplasm of the cell.

Part d. Estimate the average distance between water molecules in cytoplasm.

Part e. Determine the ratio of water molecules to potassium ions in cytoplasm.


Exercise  2.  At  a  junction  between  two  neurons,  called  a  synapse,  there  is  a  20  nm  cleft  that

separates  the  cell membranes.  A  chemical  transmitter  substance  is  released  by one  cell  (the  pre­
synaptic  cell),  diffuses  across  the  cleft,  and  arrives  at  the membrane  of  the  other  (post-synaptic) 

cell.  Assume  that  the  diffusion  coefﬁcient  of  the  chemical  transmitter  substance  is  D  = 5
 ×
10−6 cm2 /s.  Make  a  rough estimate of  the  delay caused  by diffusion of  the  transmitter  substance 
across the cleft. What are the limitations of this estimate? Explain.

Exercise 3. The time course of one-dimensional diffusion of a solute from a point source in space
and time has the form
nop4(cid:25)Dt
where no is the number of moles of solute per unit area placed at x = 0 at t = 0. cn (x; t) is
computed as a function of time for locations xa and xb , and shown in the following ﬁgure.

Problem 1. A general solution to a ﬁrst-order
can be written as

linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients

n(t) = n1 + (n0 (cid:0) n1)e(cid:0)t=(cid:28) :
a) Determine the slope m0 = dn=dt at t = 0 in terms of the constants n1 , n0 and (cid:28) .
b) If this slope were extended for t > 0 (i.e., if n(cid:3) (t) = n0 + m0 t), for what value of t will
n(cid:3) (t) = n1?
c) Plot n(t) and n(cid:3) (t) when n0 = (cid:0)10, n1 = 10, and (cid:28) = 1.

Problem 2. Four solutions to the differential equation

are shown in the following plot.

Part a. Find values of A and B that are consistent with curve a. Are these values unique? If not,
ﬁnd a second set of constants that are consistent.

differences.
Part c. Repeat part a for curve c. Compare these results to those of parts a and b. Explain
similarities and differences.

Problem 3. Assume that no mol/cm2  of sucrose (with a diffusion constant D � 0.5 × 10−5 cm2 /s) 
are  placed  in a  trough of water  at a point x  = 0 at  time  t  = 0.  Assume  that  the concentration of 
sucrose is a function of x and t only. 
a)  Show that for any ﬁxed point  xp  the maximum concentration occurs at time tm  = xp/2D .

b)  How long does it take for the concentration to reach a maximum at x = ±1 cm? 

Problem 4. The following ﬁgure illustrates a cascaded system of two water tanks. Water ﬂows out 
of the  ﬁrst tank and into the second at a rate  r1 (t), and out of the second tank at a rate r2 (t).

The rates of  ﬂow out of the tanks are proportional to the heights of the water in the tanks:  r 1 (t) = 
k1h1 (t) and r2 (t) = k2h2 (t), where k1  and k2  are each 0.02 m2 /minute. The height of tank 1 is 1 m 
and  that of  tank 2  is 2 m.  The cross-sectional area of  tank 1  is A1  = 4 m2  and  that of  the second 
tank is A2  = 2 m2 . At time t = 0, tank 1 is full and tank 2 is empty. 
a.	 If  the  height  of  water  in  tank  2  ever  exceeds  the  height  of  the  tank  (2  m),  the  water  will 
over ﬂow. Will the water ever overﬂow? Explain. 
b. 	 Set up a system of differential equations to determine h2 (t). Solve the equations to determine 
an expression for h2 (t). 
c.	 At what time does the water in tank 2 reach  its peak?  What will be the maximum height of 
water ever achieved in tank 2? 
d.  At what time will the water stop ﬂowing out of tank 1? Explain your answer in mathematical 
terms and then in physical terms. 
e.	 If both tanks were full at t = 0, would the second tank ever overﬂow? Explain.

Problem  5.  Transport  by  diffusion  tends  to move  solutes  from  regions  of  high  concentration  to 
regions of low concentration, thereby making the spatial distribution of solute more uniform. Thus 
diffusion is often associated with mixing. However, diffusion can also be used to separate solutes in 
a mixture. Such separation is important as a mechanism to purify mixtures of biological materials 
(such as mixtures of DNA fragments) and is currently being exploited in microfabricated systems 
for  biological  and  medical  analysis  (which  we  will  look  at  in  greater  detail  in  the Microﬂuidics 
Laboratory Project). 
Assume that a mixture of two molecular species is loaded into a long and narrow channel ﬁlled 
with water. Let x represent distance in the the longitudinal direction and assume that n 0  molecules 
of solute A and n0  molecules of solute B are loaded into location x = 0 at time t = 0. Assume that 
solutes A and B have different molecular weights and that their diffusivities are DA  = 10−7  cm2 /s 
and DB  = 4 × 10−7  cm2 /s, respectively. The following ﬁgure illustrates how the two species tend 
to separate as they diffuse.

Part a.  As  time elapses,  the number of molecules of  solute A  that remain  in a  test region within 
the 10µm of the starting position (i.e., −10µm< x < 10µm) decreases.  Determine the amount of 
time t0  required to get 5% of solute A to leave the test region. 
Part b. At time t = t0  found in part a, determine the amount of solute B in the test region. 
Part c.  Determine the ratio of solute A  to solute B  in the  test region at  time  t =  t0 .  Explain how 
diffusion has lead to a separation of solute A from solute B.
