Announcements 
Laboratory  reports  are DUE Monday October  25  at  noon.  You  should  submit  one  copy  of  the 
ﬁnal  draft  of  the  report.  You  should  include  the  following  items  in  an  appendix:  ﬁnal  proposal, 
copy  of  your  critique  of  a  peer’s  ﬁrst  draft,  peer  critique  of  your  ﬁrst  draft,  critique  of  your  ﬁrst 
draft by writing program, critique of your  ﬁrst draft by technical staff, photocopies of notes taken 
during original lab session. Note that there is a SEVERE LATENESS PENALTY. The grade for 
a late report will be multiplied by a lateness factor 
L = 0.3e −t/4  + 0.7e 
−t/72
where t is the number of hours late. The lateness factor is plotted below. Notice that the maximum 
grade for a report that is more than ONE DAY LATE is less than 50%.

This  lateness  factor  is  applied  regardless  of  the  reason  for  the  lateness,  except  for  health  related 
problems or personal problems certi ﬁed by the Dean’s ofﬁce. Speciﬁcally, lateness due to computer 
and/or printer problems is not exempt.

Exercise 1. Give a physical explanation for why the conduction velocity is larger in larger diameter 
ﬁbers, if all other factors are the same. 

Exercise 2. Give a physical explanation of the meaning of Equation 2.18 (in volume 2 of the text) 
without the use of equations. 

Exercise  3.  Let  the  function  f (z , t) represent  a  solution  to  the  wave  equation.  This  solution  is 
shown in the following ﬁgure as a function of time  t at the position z  = 0.

Notice that f (0, t) is non-zero for 0 < t < 2 ms and zero elsewhere. 

a)  Suppose that the wave is propagating in the +z -direction with a propagation velocity of 100 
mm/ms. Plot f (z , t) versus z  at time t = 2 ms. 
b)  Suppose  that  the wave  is  propagating  in  the −z -direction  at  a  propagation  velocity  of  100 
mm/ms. Plot f (z , t) versus z  at time t = 2 ms. 

Problem 1. The following two experiments are performed on a squid giant axon: 

•	 Experiment  #1:  The  axon  is  placed  in  a  large  volume  of  sea  water,  and  the  size  of  the 
transmembrane action potential is measured by means of an  intracellular micropipet and  is 
found to have a peak-to-peak value of 100 mV. The conduction velocity is 36 m/s. 
•	 Experiment #2:  The axon  is placed in oil and the  trans-membrane potential is still found to 
be  100 mV  peak-to-peak.  The  peak-to-peak  size  of  the extracellular  action  potential  is  75 
mV. 

Estimate the expected conduction velocity in Experiment #2.  State your assumptions.

Problem 2. A  ﬁne platinum wire with a resistance per unit length of 130  �/cm is inserted inside a 
portion of a squid axon as illustrated below.

The wire is so thin that its volume can be ignored. The axon (500 µm diameter) is electrically stim­
ulated to produce a propagated action potential traveling in the +z direction.  The action potential 
is recorded at  two  intracellular sites:  V1 (t)  is recorded at z  =  z1  and V2 (t)  is recorded at z  =  z2 . 
The distance between the stimulus electrode (not shown) and z1  is 2 cm.  Results are shown in the

The  resistivity  of  the  axoplasm  of  this  axon  is  23  �-cm.  The  resistance  per  unit  length  of  the 
external solution is 1.2 �/cm.  The wire begins at some  location between  z1  and z2 ,  but  the exact 
position of the beginning is not known and should not be used in any of your calculations. 

a)	 Determine the instantaneous speed of the action potential as it’s peak passes the point z = z 1 . 

b)	 Determine the instantaneous speed of the action potential as it’s peak passes the point z = z 2 . 

c)	 Sketch  the  extracellular  potential as  a  function  of  space  (z)  that  results  at  the  time  that  the 
peak of the action potential passes the point z = z1 .  Include distances z1 −4 < z < z1 +4 cm. 
Indicate the scale for the y axis. Describe the important features of this plot. 

d)	 Sketch  the  extracellular  potential as  a  function  of  space  (z)  that  results  at  the  time  that  the 
peak of the action potential passes the point z = z2 .  Include distances z2 −4 < z < z2 +4 cm. 
Indicate the scale for the y axis. Describe the important features of this plot.

Problem  3.  In measurement  1,  a  cylindrical  unmyelinated  axon  of  radius  a  is  placed  in  a  large 
volume  of  isotonic  sea  water  and  the  conduction  velocity  of  the  action  potential  is  measured  to 
be �1 .  The osmotic pressure of the sea water is then doubled by increasing the salt concentration, 
and the axon is allowed to come to osmotic equilibrium.  Then, in measurement 2, the conduction 
velocity is measured to be �2 . Assume that during these experiments 
•	 the  number  of  ions  transported  through  the  axon  membrane  is  negligible  compared  to  the 
number of ions inside the axon, 
•	 the volume of the axon is negligible compared to the volume of the bath, 
•	 the speciﬁc  electric properties of the membrane (the capacitance per unit area and the con­
ductance per unit area) are the same in both measurements, 
•	 the length of the axon remains unchanged, and 
•	 the external resistance per unit length of the axon, ro , is negligible compared to the internal 
resistance per unit length of the axon. 

Part a. Let ri1  and ri2  represent the internal resistance per unit length of the axon in measurements 
1 and  2,  respectively.  Determine  the numerical value  (or  a  numerical expression) for  the  ratio of 
these resistances:  ri2/ri1 . Brieﬂy explain your reasoning. 

Part b.  Determine the numerical value (or a numerical expression) for the ratio of speeds:  � 2 /�1 . 
Brieﬂy explain your reasoning.
