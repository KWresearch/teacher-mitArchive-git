Due: October 21, 2004 

The recitation on October 19 is cancelled so that we can meet that evening for a Writing Clinic. The 
Writing Clinic will be held from 7:30  to 9:30  PM.  Please  return  your written critiques of your 
peer’s laboratory report at that time. You will also receive critiques from the technical and 
writing staffs. 

Exercise  1.  Active  ion  transport  is  said  to  have  a  direct  and  an  indirect  effect  on  the  resting 
potential of a cell. De ﬁne both effects and discuss the distinction between the two effects. 

Exercise 2. Describe the distinctions between the following terms that refer to ion transport across 
a  cellular  membrane:  electrodiffusive  equilibrium,  steady-state,  resting  conditions,  and  cellular 
quasi-equilibrium.

of extracellular potassium concentration (left panel).  These measurements are to be interpreted in

hypothesis?  Does  it  require  that  GK  for  V o  =  −125 mV  is  larger  or  smaller  than  GK  for

You  may  assume  that  for  each  cell:  (1)  external  solutions  are  isotonic;  (2)  the  membranes  are 
impermeable to ions other than potassium and sodium; (3) the internal concentrations of potassium 
and  sodium  are  maintained  constant  by  a  non-electrogenic  active  transport  mechanism;  (4)  the 
total membrane conductance is 10 nS; (5) the normal resting potential is −60 mV; (6) the internal 
concentration of sodium is 20 mmol/L. 

a)  For each cell, determine the total conductance of the membrane to potassium and to sodium, 
K  and  GN a ,  respectively.  If  either  value  is  indeterminate  from  the  information given,  de­
G
scribe what additional information would be needed. 

b)  For  each  cell,  determine  the  internal  and  external  concentrations  of  potassium  and  the  ex ­
ternal  concentration  of  sodium  at  the  normal  resting  potential  (−60  mV).  If  the  value  is 
indeterminate  from  the  information  given,  describe  what  additional  information  would  be 
needed.

c)  For each cell,  determine  the  simplest equivalent electric network model  that  relates  the de­
pendence of the resting potential of the cell on the ion concentrations.  Indicate the values of 
all elements in the network. 

Problem  2.  The  membrane  of  a  cell  is  known  to  be  permeable  to  Na+  and  K+  only,  with 
passive  ionic  conductances  of  GN a  =  10−6  S/cm2  and  GK  =  10−3  S/cm2 ,  and  contains  a 
(Na+ – K + )ATPase  active  transport  mechanism  that  transports  3  molecules  of  Na+  outward  and 
2 molecules  of K+  inward  through  the membrane  for  each molecule  of ATP  split  into ADP  and 
phosphate.  In  the  experiment  shown  in  Figure  2,  the  cell  is  kept  at  a  temperature  of  24 �C.  For

At t = t1 , Na+  is injected rapidly into the cell interior, without the passage of any current through 
the membrane, to double the intracellular sodium concentration. When the injection is completed, 
the membrane  potential  hyperpolarizes  to  approximately −80 mV. At  t  =  t 2  ouabain,  a  blocker 
of  the  active  transport  mechanism,  is  applied  to  the  cell  and  the  membrane  potential  returns  to 
approximately its normal resting value. 

a)  Is the active transport mechanism electrogenic or nonelectrogenic? Explain! 
b)  Does  the active transport mechanism contribute appreciably  to  the resting potential for  t < 
t1 ? Explain! 
c)  How  many  moles  of  ATP  are  split  per  second  by  a  cm2  of  membrane  during  the  interval 
(t1 , t2 )?

Problem  3.  The  membrane  of  a  cell  contains  an  active  transport  mechanism  that  pumps  three 
sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions that it pumps into the cell. The membrane 
also supports the passive transport of sodium and potassium ions, but is impermeant to all other ions 
and is impermeant to water. The sodium conductivity is 10−5  S/cm2  and the potassium conductivity 
is 10−4  S/cm2 . The cell is allowed to come to steady state and its membrane potential is −52.5 mV. 
The  Nernst  equilibrium  potential  for  sodium  is  60  mV  and  the  Nernst  equilibrium  potential  for 
mV. The net outward current density due to active transport is  µA/cm2 .

a)  Draw an electrical circuit  to  represent  ionic  transport across  the membrane of  this cell.  In­
clude labels for each of the 6 numbered parameters provided in the problem statement. 

b)  Is the cell at rest?  If yes, prove that it is at rest.  If no, explain why not. 

c)	 Is  the cell  in quasi-equilibrium?  If  yes,  prove  that  it  is  at  quasi-equilibrium.  If  no,  explain 
why not. 

d)  Is the active transport mechanism electrogenic? Explain.

The  cell  has  channels  for  the  passive  transport  of  sodium,  potassium,  and  chloride  as  well  as  a 
pump  that actively  transports  sodium out of  the cell  and  potassium into  the  cell.  The  pump ratio

The cell also contains impermeant intracellular ions. Assume that the cell is in equilibrium at t = 0, 
i.e., assume  that at  t  = 0  the cell has reached  a condition for which all solute concentrations,  the 
cell volume, and the membrane potential are constant. 

a)  Choose one of the following statements and explain why it is true. 

6 

i)  The cell resting potential depends on GC l . 
ii)  The cell resting potential depends on VC l .

iii)  The cell resting potential depends on both GC l  and VC l .

iv)  The cell resting potential does not depend on GC l .

v)  The cell resting potential does not depend on VC l . 
vi)  The cell resting potential does not depend on either GC l  or VC l . 
b)  Determine V o . m 
c)  At t =  0, the external concentration of chloride is reduced from 150 mmol/L to 50 mmol/L 
by substituting an isosmotic quantity of an impermeant anion for chloride.  Assume that the 
concentrations  of  sodium  and  potassium  both  inside  and  outside  the  cell  remain  the  same 
and that the volume of the cell does not change. 
i)  Determine V o 
m (0+ ), the value of the membrane potential immediately after the change 
in solution. You may ignore the effect of the membrane capacitance. 
ii)  Determine V o 
m (�), the value of the membrane potential after the cell has equilibrated. 
iii)  Determine  cC l (�),  the  intracellular  chloride  concentration  after  the  cell  has  equili­
i
brated. 
iv)  Give a physical interpretation of your results in i), ii), and iii). 
v)  Discuss  the validity of  the assumptions that  the sodium and potassium concentrations 
in the cell are constant and that the volume does not change.
