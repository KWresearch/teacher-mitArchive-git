This homework assignment is smaller than average to give you time to work on your lab reports. 

First  drafts  of  your  lab  reports  are  due Friday, October  15,  2004  at  10:00 AM. Bring  3  copies. 
One will be  reviewed by  the  technical  staff.  One will be  reviewed by  the writing  staff.  One will 
be reviewed by a peer student group. You and your partner will be assigned to review the report of 
another student group. All reviews are due Tuesday October 19, 2004 when they will be discussed 
at the Writing Clinic, to be held at 7:30 PM. 

Exercise 1. Deﬁne electroneutrality and brieﬂy explain its physical basis.


Exercise 2. Deﬁne the Nernst equilibrium potential and brie ﬂy explain its physical basis.


Problem 1. Two compartments of a ﬂuid-ﬁlled chamber are separated by a membrane as shown in

the following ﬁgure. 

Compartment 1

The  area  of  the  membrane  is  100  cm2  and  the  volume  of  each  compartment  is  1000  cm 3 .  The 
solution in compartment #1 contains 1 mmol/L NaCl and 0.1 mmol/L KCL. The solution in com­
partment #2 contains 0.1 mmol/L NaCl and 1 mmol/L KCL. The temperatures of the solutions are 
24�C. The membrane  is  known  to  be  permeable  to  a  single  ion,  but  it  is  not  known  if  that  ion  is 
sodium, potassium, or chloride. Electrodes connect the solutions in the compartments to a battery. 
The current I  was measured with the battery voltage V  = 0 and was found to be I  = −1 mA. 
a)  Identify the permeant ion species. Explain your reasoning. 
b)  Draw  an  equivalent circuit  for  the  entire  system,  including  the  battery.  Indicate  values  for 
those components whose values can be determined.

c)  Determine  the  current I  that would  result  if  the  battery voltage were  set  to 1  volt.  Explain 
your reasoning.

Each  compartment  contains well-stirred  solutions  of  sodium,  potassium,  and  chloride  ions,  with 
concentrations indicated in the  ﬁgure (in mmol/L). The membrane between compartment 1 and 2 
is  permeant  to  sodium  ions  only,  and  its  speciﬁc  electrical  conductivity  GN a  is  5  mS/cm2 .  The 
membrane between compartment 2 and 3 is permeant to chloride ions only, and its speciﬁc electri­
cal conductivity GC l  is 2 mS/cm2 . Both membranes have areas A = 10 cm2 . The temperature T  is 
such that RT /(F  log e) = 60 mV. 

a)	 Sketch an electrical circuit that represents the steady-state relation between current and volt­
age for the three compartments.  Label the nodes that correspond to compartments 1, 2, and 
3.  Include the switch in your sketch. Label Im , Vm , and the conductances. 

b)	 Let V1  and V2  represent  the  steady-state potentials  in compartments 1 and 2 with reference 
to compartment 3 when the switch is open. Calculate numerical values for V1  and V2 . 

c)	 Compute the steady-state value of the current Im  when the switch is closed.
