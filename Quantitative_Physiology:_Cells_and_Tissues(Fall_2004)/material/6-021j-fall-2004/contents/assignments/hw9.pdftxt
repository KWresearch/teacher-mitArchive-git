a)  Tetrodotoxin blocks the  ﬂow of potassium through the sodium channel. 
b)  The macroscopic  sodium  current  recorded  by  an  electrode  in  a  cell  is  a  sum  of  the  single-
channel sodium currents that ﬂow through single sodium channels.

Problem  2.  Transport of  an  ion  through  a  cell membrane  can  be  represented  by  a  population of 
voltage-gated channels where each channel contains one two-state gate. The two states are state S 0 
and  state S1  and  transitions between  these states obey  ﬁrst-order  kinetics with voltage dependent 
rate constants.

Problem  3.  This  problem  deals  with  the  relation  of  current  to  voltage  for  single  ion  channels. 
Assume that conduction through an open ion channel is governed by the equation 

I  = � (Vm  − Ve), 

where I  is current  through a  single open channel, �  is  the conductance of a  single open channel, 
m  is the membrane potential across the channel, and Ve  is the equilibrium (reversal) potential for 
V
the channel. For each of the channels in this problem, assume that �  = 25 pS and V e  = 20 mV. 
a)  The  membrane  potential  Vm  and  the  average  single-channel  current  i  obtained  from  three 
different single channels (A, B, and C) are shown in Figure 1.  Both the membrane potential

and current are plotted on a time scale such that the changes appear instantaneous and only 
the  ﬁnal  values  of  these  variables  can  be  discerned  in  the  plots;  i.e.,  the  kinetics  are  not 
shown. For each of these channels, answer the following questions and explain your answers: 

i)  Is this channel voltage-gated for the illustrated depolarization? 
ii)  Is  the channel  activated (opened)  or  inactivated (closed) by  the  illustrated depolariza­
tion? 

b)  Assume  that  each  voltage-gated  channel  contains  one  two-state  gate  where  �  is  the  time 
constant of transition between states. For each of the channels, sketch the time course of i(t) 
on a normalized time scale t/� . Clearly show the current near t = 0. 

Problem  4.  Three  three-state  voltage-gated channels  (channels  a,  b,  and  c)  have  the  kinetic  dia ­
gram and state occupancy probabilities shown in Figure 2.  These channels have the same voltage 
dependent rate constants and the same equilibrium potential which is +40 mV. For the membrane 
potential shown, the channels are in state 1 with probability 1 for t < 0 and have the indicated rate 
constants for t > 0. The channels differ only in their state conductances and state gating charges as 
shown in Figure 3. Denote the expected values of the single-channel random variables as follows: 
the  conductance  as  ga (t),  gb (t),  and  gc (t);  the  ionic  currents  as  ia (t),  ib (t),  and  ic (t);  the  gating 
charges as qa (t), qb (t), and qc (t); the gating currents as iga (t), igb (t), and igc (t). 
a)  Which of the waveforms shown in Figure 4 best represents gb (t)? Explain.

b)  Which of the waveforms shown in Figure 4 best represents gc(t)?  Explain.

Problem 5.  Figure 5 shows a model of a voltage-gated ion channel with one three-state gate plus 
representative single-channel ionic and gating current records. 

a)  Assume  that  the voltage-current characteristic  of  the channel  is  the  same  for  states 1 and 3 
and  is linear.  Determine the open channel conductance and equilibrium (reversal) potential 
for this channel. 
b)  The  ionic  current  trace  shown  in  Figure  5  has  three  non-zero  segments.  Determine which 
state the gate is in during each non-zero segment. Explain your reasoning. 
c)  Figure  6  illustrates  the  dependence  of  the  steady-state  probability  that  the  channel will  be 
in  each  of  its  three  states  on  the  membrane  potential.  Let  iss  represent  the  average  value 
of  the  ionic current  that results after  steady-state conditions are  reached  in a voltage clamp 
experiment  in  which  Vm  is  held  constant.  Assume  that  the  experiment  is  repeated  for  a 
number of different values of membrane potential Vm .  Plot the relation between iss  and Vm . 
Describe the important features of your plot.
