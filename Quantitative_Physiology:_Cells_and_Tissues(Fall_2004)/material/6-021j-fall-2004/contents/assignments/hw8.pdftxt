Problem  1.  A myelinated  axon,  shown  schematically  in  Figure  5.8  of  volume  2  of  the  text,  has 
the dimensions L = 2 mm, D = 14 µm, d = 10 µm, l = 0.7 µm.  The resistivity of the cytoplasm 
i  =  110 �·cm,  and  the  resistance  of  the  extracellularly  space  can  be  assumed  to  be  negligible.

The membrane potential, Vm , and current per unit length, Km , are shown in Figure 1 for a location 
at an internode as an action potential propagates down the  ﬁber. Assume that the internode can be

Figure 3: Comparison of ionic currents during an action potential for an unmyelinated squid giant 
axon  and  a  myelinated  toad  node  of  Ranvier.  These  ionic  currents  are  based  on  calculations  of 
models of the squid giant axon (adapted from Cooley and Dodge, 1965, Figure 2.4) and toad node 
of Ranvier (adapted from Frankenhaeuser and Huxley, 1964, Figure 6). 

Problem 2.  A squid giant axon (which  is an unmyelinated axon) has a diameter of 500 µm.  The 
ionic currents during the passage of one action potential are shown in Figure 3. The normal internal 
concentration of sodium is 40 mmol/L. In contrast, consider a frog myelinated  ﬁber for which the 
axon  diameter  (not  including  the  myelin)  is  10  µm,  the  ﬁber  diameter  (including  the  myelin)  is 
2 
14 µm,  the  internodal  length  is 2 mm,  the nodal  length  is 0.7  µm,  and  the nodal area  is 22 µm . 
We  shall assume  that action potentials occur  only at  the nodes.  The  ionic currents at  the node of 
Ranvier during the passage of an action potential are also shown in Figure 3. You may assume that 
the sodium current is negligible in the internodes.  The normal internal concentration of sodium is 
10 mmol/L in the frog ﬁber. 
Both the squid unmyelinated ﬁber and the frog myelinated ﬁber conduct action potentials with 
about  the  same conduction velocity.  This problem concerns  the energetic  efﬁciency of  these  two 
ﬁbers. 

a)  Compute  the  number  of  moles  of  sodium  entering  each  ﬁber  per  action  potential  per  unit 
length of  ﬁber. 
b)  Assume  that  the  energy  expended  to  pump  the  accumulated  sodium  out  of  the  cell  can  be 
measured  in  terms of  the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed  to ADP and  assume  that 3 
moles  of  Na+  are  transported  out  of  the  axon  for  every  mole  of  ATP  hydrolyzed  to  ADP 
inside the axon by  the (Na+ -K+ )ATPase pump.  Find  the ratio of energy expended per unit 
length  per  action  potential  in  order  to  pump out  the  accumulated  sodium  for  the  squid  un­
myelinated ﬁber to that for the frog myelinated ﬁber. 
c)  Describe the advantages of the frog myelinated ﬁber over the squid unmyelinated ﬁber. 

Problem 3.  Figure 4 shows a detail of a propagating action potential calculated using a model of 
a myelinated nerve ﬁber (Figure 5.31 in volume 2 of the text). 

a)  Describe a method by which  the data  in Figure 4 could be analyzed  to estimate  the current

acteristics of the node and internode (Figure 5.31 in volume 2 of the text). The membrane potential 
is  plotted as  a  function  of  distance  along  the  ﬁber  (expressed  in  units of  internodal  length where 
L = 1.38 mm). 

Im  ﬂowing out of a node.  Apply your method to calculate the current  ﬂowing out of node 6 
at t0  = 0.75 ms. Assume that ri  = 140 M�/cm>> ro . 
b)  Describe a method by which  the data  in Figure 4 could be analyzed  to estimate  the current 
density Km  ﬂowing out of an internode. Apply your method to determine whether current is 
ﬂowing into or out of the internode between nodes 5 and 6 at  t0  = 0.75 ms. 

Problem 4. Although there is considerable scatter, the ratio of the inner diameter d to outer diam­
eter D  of the layer of myelin that encircles a myelinated  ﬁber tends to be about 0.74, as shown in 
the  following  ﬁgure,  where  every  symbol  represents measurements  of  d/D  and  d  for  a  different 
ﬁber.

The point of this problem is to investigate the hypothesis that this relation between  d and D results 
from an evolutionary optimization of the cable model. 
Part a. Assume that the myelinated part (the internode) of a myelinated ﬁber can be represented by 
the cable model. Assume the myelin can be represented by a homogeneous electrical material with 
resistivity �m  and permittivity ρm . Assume the intracellular conductor is a homogeneous conductor 
with resistivity �w .  Assume  that  the extracellular conductor has negligible resistance.  Determine 
an expression for the space constant �C  of this model in terms of the inner diameter d and the outer 
diameter D of the layer of myelin. Hint: The radial resistance of a cylindrical shell is given below.

where �o  =  D �m /8�w .  Thus,  if D  is  ﬁxed (i.e.,  if  the axon  is constrained to  ﬁt  into a constant 
volume), then �o  is a constant, and �C  is maximum when d � 0.6D . 

b1) 	 Explain  in  physical  terms why  the  space  constant  gets  smaller  as  the  value  of  d  decreases 
below 0.6D . 

b2) 	 Explain  in  physical  terms why  the  space  constant  gets  smaller  as  the  value  of  d  increases 
above 0.6D . 

Part c. The value of d/D that maximizes the space constant of the cable model is remarkably close 
to the ratio of 0.74 seen experimentally.  Nevertheless, it is smaller.  One possible reason why it is 
smaller is that we ignored the resistance of the outer conductor ro . How would the space constant’s 
dependence  on  d/D  change  if  the  resistance  of  a  thin  layer  of  saline  (thickness  =  0.1D)  were 
included in the calculation.  Make a plot that contains both the old relation (shown in the previous 
plot)  and  the  new  relation.  Brie ﬂy  describe  how  the  addition of  the  outer  resistance  changes  the 
predicted space constant.
