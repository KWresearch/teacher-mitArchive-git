Exercise 1. Describe the dissolve-diffuse theory for diffusion through cellular membranes. 

Exercise 2.  Two time constants are  involved in two-compartment diffusion through a membrane: 
the steady-state time constant of the membrane (�ss ) and the equilibrium time constant for the two 
compartments (�eq ). Without the use of equations, describe these two time constants. 

Exercise  3.  A  solute  n  diffuses  through  a membrane  that  separates  two  compartments  that  have 
different initial concentrations. The concentrations in the two compartments as a function of time, 
cn (t) and cn (t), are shown in the following ﬁgure.

The volumes of the two compartments are Va  and Vb .  Is Va  > Vb  or is Va  < Vb? Explain. 

Exercise 4. Deﬁne  osmolarity. 

Exercise  5.  The  following  three  formulas  for  the  sugar  (trisaccharide)  rafﬁnose  (found  in  sugar 
beets) were proposed: 

C12H28O14 , 
C
18H42O21 , 
C
36H84O42 . 

De Vries (1888) used a plant cell to determine that plasmolysis occurred with a solution containing 
59.4 grams of rafﬁnose per liter of water whereas plasmolysis occurred in a solution of sucrose at a

concentration of 0.1 mol/L. Based on these measurements, de Vries determined the correct formula 
for rafﬁnose. Which formula would you choose and why would you choose it? 

Problem 1. Consider diffusion through a thin membrane that separates two otherwise closed com­
partments.  As  illustrated in Figure 1,  the membrane and both compartments have cross  sectional 
areas A  = 1  cm2 .  Compartment  1  has  length L1  =  50  cm,  compartment  2  has  length  L2  =  10

cm,  and  the  membrane  thickness  is  W  =  10−4  cm.  Assume  that  (1)  the  compartments  contain 
sugar  solutions and  that  both  compartments  are well  stirred  so  that  the  concentration  of  sugar  in 
compartment 1 can  be written as  c1 (t)  and  that  in compartment 2 can  be written as  c2 (t);  (2)  the 
concentration  of  sugar  in  the  membrane  can  be  written  as  c(x, t),  where  x  represents  distance 
through  the membrane;  (3)  the diffusivity of  sugar  in  the membrane  is Dsugar  =  10−5  cm2 /s and 
the membrane:water partition coefﬁcient  km:w  is 1; (4) the concentration of sugar in the membrane 
has reached steady state at time t = 0 and that c1 (0) = 1 mol/L and c2 (0) = 0 mol/L. 
a)  Compute the  ﬂux of sugar through the membrane at time  t = 0, �s(0). 
b)  Compute the  ﬁnal value of concentration of sugar in compartment 1,  c1 (�). 
c)  Let �eq  characterize  the amount of  time required  to reach equilibrium.  What would happen 
to �eq  if the diffusivity of sugar in the membrane were doubled? Explain your reasoning.

Problem  2.  A  thin  membrane  and  a  thick  membrane,  that  are  otherwise  identical,  are  used  to 
separate  identical  solutions of  volume  V  = 1 cm3  (Figure  2).  All  the membrane  surfaces  facing 
the  solutions  have  area  A  = 1 cm2 .  The  thin membrane  has  thickness  ds  =  10−4  cm;  the  thick 
membrane has thickness dl  = 1 cm. For t < 0 the aqueous solutions on both sides of the membrane 
are  identical and  do  not contain  solute n.  At  t  = 0 a  small concentration  of  solute n is  added  to 
the  solution on  side  1  of  the membrane.  You may  assume  that  there  is  no water  ﬂow  across  the 
membrane.  The  diffusion  coefﬁcient  and  membrane:solution  partition  coefﬁcient  of 
n  in  both 
membranes are Dn  = 10−5 cm2 /s and kn  = 2, respectively.

a)  For  each  membrane,  estimate  the  time  �ss  that  it  takes  for  the  concentration  pro ﬁle  in  the 
membrane to reach its steady-state spatial distribution. 
b)  For  each  membrane,  ﬁnd  the  time  �eq  that  it  takes  for  the  solutions  on  the  two  sides  of 
the membrane to come  to equilibrium assuming that the spatial distribution of solute in the 
membrane is the steady-state distribution. 
c)  Is  it reasonable  to assume that Fick’s Law for membranes applies for  the thin membrane at 
each instant in time, i.e., does 

�n (t) = Ps (c n (t) − c n (t)) ?

where Ps  is the permeability of the thin membrane. 
d)  Is it reasonable to assume that Fick’s Law for membranes applies for the thick membrane at 
each instant in time, i.e., does 

�n(t) = Pl (cn (t) − cn (t)) ?

Problem  3.  Glucose  is  dripped  at  a  constant  rate  R = 2µmol/s  into  a  bath  that  contains  10 12 
identical red blood cells, as shown in the following ﬁgure. 

m)3  and a surface area AC  = 80 (µm)2 , 
Assume that each red blood cell has a volume  = 
µ25 (
VC 
and  that neither  of  these  changes  over  the  time  interval considered  in  this problem.  Assume  that 
the volume of  the bath is 1 L, and  that the bath  is well stirred.  (You may assume that the amount 
of water dripped into the bath is negligibly small.) The concentration of glucose in the bath, c b (t), 
if found to increase as a function of time t, as shown in the following plot.

Part a.  Is the following logic True or False? 

The  ﬂux  of  glucose  through  each  of  the  cell membranes  cannot  be  constant  over  the 
time  0  < t < 900  s,  because  if  it  were,  the  concentration  cb (t)  would  be  a  linear 
function of time. 

If the truthfulness of this statement cannot be determined from the information provided, describe 
what additional information is needed. 
Part  b.  Determine  the  ﬂux  of  glucose  through  the  membrane  of  each  cell  at  time  t =  900  s. 
Use  our  normal  convention  that  outward  ﬂux  (i.e.,  ﬂux  leaving  the  cell)  is  positive  and  inward 
ﬂux  is  negative.  Determine  the  numerical  value  (or  numerical  expression)  and  units.  If  you 
cannot  determine  the  numerical  value  from  the  information  provided,  describe  what  additional 
information is needed. 
Part  c.  Determine  the  ﬂux  of  glucose  through  the membrane  of  each  cell  at  time  t = 0  s.  Use 
our  normal  convention  that  outward  ﬂux  (i.e.,  ﬂux  leaving  the  cell)  is  positive  and  inward  ﬂux 
is  negative.  Determine  the  numerical  value  (or  numerical  expression)  and  units.  If  you  cannot 
determine the numerical value from the information provided, describe what additional information 
is needed.

Problem 4.  All cells are surrounded by a cell membrane.  The cytoplasm of most cells contains a 
variety of organelles  that are  also enclosed within membranes.  Assume  that a  spherical cell with 
radius R  =  50µm contains a spherical organelle called a vesicle, with radius r  = 1µm, as shown 
in the following ﬁgure.

Assume that the membranes surrounding the cell and vesicle are uniform lipid bilayers with iden­
tical compositions and the same thickness d = 10 nm. Assume that solute X  is transported across 
both  the cell and vesicle membrane via  the dissolve and diffuse mechanism.  Assume  that X  dis ­
solves  equally well  in  the  bath  and  in  the  aqueous  interiors  of  the  vesicle  and  cell.  Assume  that 
the solute X  dissolves 100 times  less readily  in  the membrane (i.e.,  the partitioning coefﬁcient  is 
0.01). Assume the diffusivity of X  in the membranes is 10−7cm2 /s. 
Initially, the concentration of X  is zero inside the cell and inside the vesicle. At time t = 0, the 
cell is plunged into a bath that contains X  with concentration 1 mmol/L. 

a) 	 Estimate the time that is required for the concentration of X  in the cell to reach 0.5 mmol/L. 
Find a numerical value or explain why it is not possible to obtain a numerical value with the 
information that is given. 

b) 	 Estimate  the  time  that  is  required  for  the  concentration  of  X  in  the  vesicle  to  reach 
0.5  mmol/L.  Find  a  numerical  value  or  explain why  it  is  not  possible  to  obtain  a  numeri­
cal value with the information that is given.

Problem  5.  As  your  ﬁrst  assignment at Tiny ﬂuidics Inc.,  you  are  asked  to  design a micro ﬂuidic 
device that will remove small molecules from a sample of  ﬂuid that contains both large molecules 
and small molecules. After some thinking, you design the laminar ﬂow device shown below.

The  sample  is  injected  in a port with width  � .  The  sample  ﬂow  is  surrounded by buffers  injected 
on both sides of  the sample.  The combined  ﬂow  then passes through a channel  that has width  W 
and length L after which the ﬂuids are separated into a desired ﬁltrate output (in a channel of width 
d)  and  two waste  outputs.  Assume  that  the  ﬂuid moves with  the  same  speed  v in all  parts  of  the 
micro ﬂuidic device (although this is not generally  true,  it  is a convenient starting point).  Assume 
that � << d, and that W  is sufﬁciently large that it can be taken to be in ﬁnity. 

To  test  the  device,  you mix  a  solution  that  contains  equal  concentrations of  2  proteins, A  and B. 
The diffusivity of solute B is four times that of solute A. 

Part  a.  Brieﬂy  explain  how  this  device  takes  advantage  of  differences  in  diffusivities  to  achieve 
separation. 
Part  b.  Let  fA  represent  the  ratio  of  the  amount  of  solute A  found  in  the  ﬁltrate  divided  by  the 
amount of  solute A  in  the sample.  Determine an expression for  fA .  Determine an expression for 
the analogous ratio fB  for solute B. 

The following ﬁgure shows a plot of the dependence of  fA  and fB  on L, when � = 1µm, d = 20µm, 
v = 1 mm/s, and DA  = 10−7  cm2 /s.
