Announcements 
There is no homework assignment due this week, because of Veteran’s day. This assignment is due 
on the Thursday after Veteran’s day (November 18). 
First Drafts of your HH project is due on November 19 (one day after this homework is due!). 
The  ﬁrst  draft  should  consist  of  hardcopies  of  3-5  technical  slides  of  the  type  you  plan  to  show 
during your ﬁnal oral presentation. Each slide should be accompanied by a separate sheet of paper 
that lists approximately three bullet points that you will discuss in your presentation of this slide. 
The  ﬁrst draft should also contain a  1 page extended abstract for your HH project.  The abstract 
should summarize your ﬁndings and explain why they are interesting. 
Please  take  advantage  of  THIS  week  to  work  on  your  project  plus  the  HH  portion  of  this 
homework assignment!

Figure  1:  Relation  of  membrane  potential  and  membrane  current  density  during  a  propagated 
action  potential.  The  dotted  vertical  line marks  the  time  of  occurrence  of  the  peak  of  the  action 
potential. 

membrane current density consists of an initial outward current followed by an early inward current 
whose peak occurs before the peak in the action potential. 

a)  The initial outward current is due primarily to which of the following: 

i)  an ionic current carried by sodium ions. 
ii)  an ionic current carried by potassium ions. 
iii)  an ionic current carried by chloride ions. 
iv)  an ionic current carried by calcium ions. 
v)  a capacitance current. 

b)  The early inward current is due primarily to which of the following: 

i)  an ionic current carried by sodium ions. 
ii)  an ionic current carried by potassium ions. 
iii)  an ionic current carried by chloride ions. 
iv)  an ionic current carried by calcium ions. 
v)  a capacitance current. 

c)  Before  the  peak  of  the  action  potential,  the  membrane  potential  increases  from  its  resting 
value whereas the membrane current density is ﬁrst outward (increasing and then decreasing) 
and then reverses polarity to become inward (decreasing and then increasing again). Discuss 
this  complex  relation  between membrane  potential  and  current.  In  particular,  explain  how 
the  Hodgkin-Huxley  model  accounts  for  the  fact  that  the  current  can  be  both  inward  and 
outward during an interval of time when the membrane potential is depolarizing.

Exercise 3. Does the time constant of a cylindrical cell depend on its dimensions? Does the space 
constant of a cylindrical cell depend on its dimensions? 

Exercise 4.  For each of  the following statements, assume  that  the electrical properties of a patch 
of  the membrane of  the  cell can  be  represented  as  a parallel  resistance  and capacitance.  Assume 
that  the cell has a cylindrical shape with a  radius  that  is  small compared  to  the  length of  the cell. 
Determine if each assertion is true or false and give a reason for your choice. 

a)  For an electrically small cell, the membrane potential in response to a step of current through 
the membrane is an exponential function of time. 
b)  If a step of current is applied through one part of the membrane of an electrically small cell, 
the resulting changes in membrane potential will be constant along the length of the cell for 
all times after the step. 
c)  For an electrically large cell, the steady-state value of the membrane potential in response to a 
step of current applied through the membrane at one position along the cell is an exponential 
function of longitudinal position along the cell. 
d)  For an electrically large cell, the steady-state value of the membrane potential in response to 
a step of current applied through the membrane at one position along the cell is a Gaussian 
function of position along the cell.

Each of A–D shows a plot with two curves:  the thin gray curve was obtained for default parameters 
and  the  thick  black  curve  was  obtained  for  one  of  the  tests  cases.  In  each  test  case,  a  single 
parameter  was  changed  from  its  default  value.  Default  values  of  the  axon  characteristics  are  as 
follows — length: 3 cm, radius: 0.0238 cm, cytoplasm resistivity: 35.4  �·cm, extracellular speciﬁc 
resistance:  0 �/cm. 

a.	 Which  of  A–D  shows  results  when  intracellular  sodium  concentration  was  reduced  from 
icN a  = 50 to 25 mmol/L. Explain.

Problem 2. Ionic currents are calculated for a space-clamped squid giant axon using the Hodgkin-
Huxley model, with all parameters set to their default values (as listed on page 191 of volume 2
of the text) except for one parameter. For times t < 0, the membrane potential is held at (cid:0)75 mV
and the model is at steady state. At t = 0, the membrane potential is stepped to +5 mV and the
resulting ionic current density is computed. Results for six calculations are shown in the following
ﬁgure.

Problem 3. Space-clamped responses of the Hodgkin-Huxley model were calculated with the
leakage conductance set to zero, GL = 0, and with all other parameters set to their default val-
ues. The model was stimulated with a pulse of membrane current density of duration 0.5 ms; the
amplitude was varied. The following ﬁgure shows the response for an amplitude of 40 (cid:22)A/cm 2 .

For  each  amplitude  of  the  pulse  of membrane  current  density,  the  ionic  current  density  J ion  and 
the membrane  potential  Vm  were  determined at  t  = 0.7 ms, where  t  = 0 marks  the  onset  of  the 
current  pulse.  The  relation  between  Jion  at  t  = 0.7 ms  and  Vm  at  t  = 0.7 ms  that  results when 
the pulse amplitude is varied is shown in the following  ﬁgures.  The  left panel shows results for a 
broad  range  of membrane  potential,  from −80  to +60 mV. The  right panel  shows  results  for  the 
narrower range from −76 to −62 mV.

Part a. Determine the value of the resting potential to within 1 mV. Explain your choice.

Part b.  If  the current  stimulus is such  that  Vm (t) =  −66 mV at  t  = 0.7 ms, does  the membrane

potential increase with time or decrease with time? Explain.

Part c. Determine the value of the threshold potential to within 1 mV. Explain your choice.

Part d. Between the resting potential and this threshold potential, determine whether |JN a | > |JK |, 

|JN a | = |JK |, or |JN a | <  |JK |. Explain.

Part  e.  Just  above  the  threshold  potential,  determine  whether  |JN a |  >  |JK |,  |JN a |  =  |JK |,  or 

|JN a | < |JK |. Explain.


Problem  4.  The  Hodgkin-Huxley  model  of  a  space-clamped  squid  giant  axon  stimulated  by  a 

pulse of membrane current of amplitude 20 µA/cm2  and of duration 0.5 ms produces a membrane

action  potential.  You  can  demonstrate  this  to  yourself  by  running  the  space-clamped  version  of

the  Hodgkin-Huxley  simulation  software  provided  with  this  subject.  Start  by  using  the  default

parameters.  If  you  change  the  membrane  capacitance  from  1  µF/cm2  to  20  µF/cm2 ,  no  action

potential occurs.

Part a. Explain why no action potential occurs for the larger value of membrane capacitance. You

may base your explanation on comparison of the membrane currents, conductances, and activation

variables for the default parameters and for the increased capacitance condition. Alternatively, you

may wish to perform additional computations with other values of membrane capacitance.

Part b. With membrane capacitance ﬁxed at 20  µF/cm2 , determine a set of parameters that produce

an action potential with a waveform that is identical to the action potential obtained with the default

parameters.  To determine whether or not the action potential is identical to that obtained with the

default  parameters,  you  can  superimpose plots  and/or  look  at  the  parameters  computed  from  the

responses.  You  should  use  the  computer  as  a  tool  to  check  your  ideas  and  not  as  a  substitute

for  thinking.  You  should  avoid  a  strictly  trial-and-error  approach.  There  are  simply  too  many

parameters  in  the Hodgkin-Huxley model  for  you  to explore  them all  randomly.  When you have

arrived at a satisfactory solution, explain why your parameter change produces the desired result.

Problem  5.  Constant  currents  I1  and  I2  are  applied  to  the  exteriors  of  Axons  1  and  2,  respec­
tively, and  the resulting time-independent changes  in membrane potential are  vm1 (z ) and vm2 (z ), 
respectively.  I1  and I2  are adjusted so that vm1 (0) = vm2 (0) = 10 mV.  This change in potential is 
sufﬁciently small so that the membrane voltage-current characteristic may be assumed to be linear. 
You  may  also  assume  that  ro  �  ri  for  both  axons  and  that  ro  is  the  same  for  both  axons.  The 
geometries and parameters for Axons 1 and 2 are given below, where a is the axon radius, � i  is the 
cytoplasmic resistivity, and Gm  is the speci ﬁc membrane conductance.

The stimulus current, a brief positive pulse at t = 0, is the same for each arrangement of electrodes.
The pulse has a duration that is much shorter than the membrane time constant of the cell, and a
strength that is low enough that the cell’s voltage response remains in its linear range of operation.
The space constant of the cell is (cid:21)C . In arrangement d, the potential is recorded and the current is
delivered at the same longitudinal position. In part e, the electrodes are much longer than (cid:21)C .
For each of the different arrangements (parts a-e in the ﬁgure) determine which of the following
waveforms for v (t) represents the deviation of the measured potential from its resting value. For
each waveform, the horizontal axis corresponds to v (t) = 0, and the vertical axis to t = 0. If no
waveform applies, answer None. Explain the basis of your choice in each case.
