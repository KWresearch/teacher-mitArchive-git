Exercise 1.  It  is known that  the membrane of a certain  type of cell  is highly permeable  to water, 
but relatively impermeable to L-glucose, sodium ions, and chloride ions. When the cell is removed 
from  interstitial  ﬂuids  and  placed  in  a  150  mmol/L  NaCl  solution,  the  cell  neither  shrinks  nor 
swells. 

a)  Would the cell shrink, swell, or remain at constant volume if placed in 150 mmol/L solution 
of L-glucose? Explain. 
b)  Would the cell shrink, swell, or remain at constant volume if placed in a 300 mmol/L solution 
of L-glucose? Explain.

Problem 1.  A volume element with constant cross-sectional area A has rigid walls and is divided

the membrane is free to move in the x-direction as shown in the following ﬁgure.

The  semipermeable  membrane  is  permeable  to water  but  not  to  the  solutes  (glucose  or  NaCl  or 
CaCl2 ).  At  t  = 0,  solute 1  is  added  to  side  1  to  give an  initial concentration  of  c1 (0)  and  solute 
2  is  added  to  side  2  to  give  an  initial concentration  of  c2 (0).  Concentrations  are  speci ﬁed  as  the 
number  of  millimoles  of  glucose  or  NaCl  or  CaCl2  per  liter  of  solution.  The  initial  position  of 
the membrane  is  x(0).  For  each  of  the  following parts,  ﬁnd  the  ﬁnal  (equilibrium) values  of  the 
membrane position x(�), and the concentrations, c1 (�) and c2 (�).

Problem 2.  A spherical cell has a freely distensible membrane that is permeable to solute A,  im­
permeant to solute B, and permeable to water.  The cell contains NI  moles of impermeant solutes, 
and is allowed to equilibrate in a bath in which the concentration of A is zero and the concentration 
of B is c1 .  The bath is large compared to the cell.  The cell volume in this bath is V0 . At t = 0, the 
cell is moved to a bath that contains equal concentrations of A and B, cA  = cB  =  2 c1 .

a.	 Is the new bath hyper-, hypo-, or iso-osmotic with the cell at t = 0? 
b.	 If  the  hydraulic  conductivity  of  the  cell  is  LV ,  what  is  the  rate  of  increase  of  the  volume, 
dV (t)/dt just after the cell is moved (i.e., at t = 0+)? 
c.	 What is the equilibrium volume of the cell in terms of V0 ? Explain brieﬂy.

Problem 3.  The following  ﬁgure shows the design of a miniature pump  that can be  implanted in 
the body to deliver a drug. No batteries are required to run this pump!

Frictionless,

piston 

Drug 
orifice 

0.7 cm 

Chamber 1 
(solute) 

Chamber 2 
(drug) 

3 cm 

The pump contains two cylindrical chambers  ﬁlled with incompressible  ﬂuids:  the  two chambers 
together have a length of 3 cm and a diameter of 0.7 cm. Chamber 1 is ﬁlled with a solution whose 
concentration  is  10  mol/L;  the  osmolarity  of  this  solution  greatly  exceeds  that  of  body  ﬂuids. 
Chamber 2 is ﬁlled with the drug solution. The two chambers are separated by a frictionless, mass ­
less,  and  impermeable  piston.  The  piston moves  freely  and  supports  no  difference  in  hydraulic 
pressure  between  the  chambers;  the  piston  allows  no  transport  of  water,  solute  or  drug  between 
chambers.  The  pump walls are  rigid,  impermeable and  cylindrical with  an  oriﬁce  at  one  end  for 
delivering the drug and a rigid, semipermeable membrane at the other end. The oriﬁce diameter is 
sufﬁciently  large  that  the  hydraulic pressure  drop  across  this oriﬁce  is  negligible and  sufﬁciently 
small so that the diffusion of drug through the oriﬁce is also negligible. The semipermeable mem­
brane is permeable to water only, and not permeable to the solute. Assume that T  = 300 K. 

a)  Provide a discussion of 50 words or fewer for each of the following: 

i)  What is the physical mechanism of drug delivery implied by the pump design? 
ii)  What is(are) the source(s) of energy for pumping the drug? 
iii)  Assume  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  drug  in  the  pump  for  the  lifetime  of  the  im­
planted  subject  and  that  it  is  necessary  to  provide  a  constant  rate  of  drug  delivery. 
Which fundamental factors limit the useful lifetime of this pump in the body? 

b)  When implanted in the body, the pump delivers the drug at a rate of 1 µL/h.  Find the value 
of the hydraulic conductivity, LV  , of the semipermeable membrane.

Problem 4. A large fraction of the molecules in a cell membrane are phospholipids, which have a
hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails. When puriﬁed phospholipids are added to a saline solu-
tion, the phospholipids self assemble into a variety of stable structures, one of which is spherical
and is called a liposome.

Bath

Liposome

Liposomes have saline interiors and exteriors that are separated
by a phospholipid bilayer, much like a biological cell. Liposomes
can be used as artiﬁcial cells to test theories about membrane trans-
port.
Assume that a liposome is created in a solution that contains
200 mmol/L of a solute I that cannot permeate the phospholipid bi-
layer. Assume that the inner solution initially contains 200 mmol/L
of solute I and the initial radius is 30(cid:22)m. Assume that the thickness
of the bilayer is much smaller than the diameter of the liposome.

Assume that water can permeate the phospholipid bilayer, and that hydraulic pressure gradients
across the bilayer can be ignored. Assume that the temperature is 300 K.
Assume that the liposome is transfered at time t = 0 to a bath that contains 200 mmol/L of
solute A and 100 mmol/L of solute B. The liposome initially shrinks but then swells and reaches
an ultimate radius of approximately 38(cid:22)m as shown in the following plots. The left plot shows the
time course for the ﬁrst 1000 seconds. The right plot shows just the ﬁrst 100 seconds of the same
data.

Provide a numerical value (or numerical expression) with units. If it is not possible to determine
the concentration from the information provided, explain why.

brane? If it is not possible to determine this information, explain why.

Liposome 

Liposomes have  saline  interiors and  exteriors  that are  separated  by  a  phospholipid bilayer, much 
like  a  biological  cell,  as  illustrated  above.  Liposomes  can  be  used  as  artiﬁcial  cells  to  test  the­
ories  about  membrane  transport.  Assume  that  a  liposome  is  created  in  a  solution  that  contains 
100 mmol/L of a solute A  that cannot permeate  the phospholipid bilayer.  Assume  that water can 
permeate  the phospholipid bilayer,  and  that  the  liposome comes  to equilibrium with a volume of 
1 pL (10−12  L) of internal solution containing A with concentration 100 mmol/L. 
The liposome is then transferred to one of the following solutions 
•  solution 1:  100 mmol/L of A plus 10 mmol/L of B 
•  solution 2:  90 mmol/L of A plus 10 mmol/L of B 
•  solution 3:  100 mmol/L of B 
where B  is a solute that can permeate the phospholipid bilayer. Both A and B  are nonelectrolytes, 
and  the baths are  large  compared  to  the  volume of  the  liposome.  Assume  that  transport of water 
and transport of the permeant solute B are independent of each other, i.e., water transport does not 
effect transport of B  and vice versa. 
(a.)  Calculate the equilibrium volume of the liposome in solution 1. Discuss your result brie ﬂy. 

(b.)  Calculate the equilibrium volume of the liposome in solution 2. Discuss your result brieﬂy. 

(c.)  Calculate the equilibrium volume of the liposome in solution 3. Discuss your result brieﬂy.
