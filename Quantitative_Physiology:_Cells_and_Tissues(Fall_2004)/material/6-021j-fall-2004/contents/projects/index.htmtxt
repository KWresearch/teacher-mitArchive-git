This subject includes two projects. The first is a laboratory project on
microfluidics. It provides an opportunity to study molecular transport and
diffusion. In the second project, a software representation of the Hodgkin-
Huxley model for a neural membrane will be used to introduce students to the
use of computer simulation to understand the behavior of complex systems.
The projects provide an opportunity to learn about:
   1. Planning experiments,
   2. Acquiring, processing, and interpreting data, and
   3. Communicating the results to others.
Both projects require a written proposal, which includes a well-defined
hypothesis and procedures to test the hypothesis. For the laboratory project,
you will use equipment in an MIT laboratory. You will have to schedule a 2-hour
session to complete an introductory pre-lab exercise. You can then schedule
additional time at your convenience to complete your project (typically 3-
4 hours total). The theoretical project is done on a computer.
Students are encouraged to work in pairs for both projects. Partners are
encouraged to submit a joint proposal, to cooperate in processing data, in
discussing interpretations, and in preparing their reports. Partners are also
encouraged to submit a joint report. We strongly believe that students learn
more by working with other students than by working in isolation.
The report for the first project is written. It should be approximately 10
pages long and structured as a scientific paper. The report for the second
project is oral. It should be 12 minutes in length and should be delivered
during the next to last week of the semester.
The reports for both projects have firm due dates, which are listed in the
calendar section. There is a severe lateness penalty: the grade for a late
report will be multiplied by a lateness factor
L = 0:3e -t/4 + 0.7e -t/72
where t is the number of hours late.
