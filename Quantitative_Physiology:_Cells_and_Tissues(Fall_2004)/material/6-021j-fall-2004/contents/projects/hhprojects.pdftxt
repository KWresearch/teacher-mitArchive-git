Hodgkin-Huxley Project 

This theoretical project is intended to provide an opportunity to learn about the complex behav­
iors  that can  be  exhibited by  the Hodgkin-Huxley model and  to compare  behaviors  of  the model 
with behaviors of electrically excitable cells.  We have two simulations.  The ﬁrst models a space-
clamped  axon.  That  model  generates  membrane  action  potentials.  The  second  models  an  axon 
without space-clamp (although the second model can simulate a space clamp since the  longitudi­
nal  resistances  can  be  set  to  zero).  The  second model can  produce  propagated action  potentials. 
The  second  model  can  be  used  to  explore  a  wider  range  of  phenomena  than  the  ﬁrst.  The  ﬁrst 
model is faster and simpler than the second. Thus both models are useful, and your project can use 
either or both of the models. 
Students  are  STRONGLY  encouraged  to  work  in  pairs,  however,  individual  projects  will  be 
approved if there are extenuating circumstances.  If a pair of students collaborate on a project they 
should submit a single proposal and a single report which identiﬁes both members of the team and 
gives  both  email  addresses.  Proposals  should  be  submitted  via  the  form  available  on  the MIT 
server.  Proposals will  be  returned  as  soon  as  possible  so  that  students  can  revise  them.  Only  the 
ﬁnal, accepted proposal will be given a grade. 
The demonstration project performed in lecture on the effect of temperature cannot be the basis 
of a student project. 

Practical considerations in the choice of a topic 

Projects can involve almost any of the properties of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. However, to avoid 
projects whose aims are vague (e.g., “I would like to understand how the Hodgkin-Huxley model 
works”) the proposed project should be in the form of a speciﬁc and testable hypothesis.  Projects 
that involve months of computation should obviously be avoided. The amount of computation time 
should be explicitly taken into account in planning a project. For example, any project that involves 
measuring the threshold of occurrence of an action potential for many different parameter values is 
bound to be very time consuming, because determining the threshold for a single set of parameters 
itself involves many computations. The task is to choose a physiological property of the excitation 
of the action potential that is of interest, and then to deﬁne a speciﬁc, feasible project. 

Choice of topics 

Topics  can  involve  comparing  predictions  of  the  Hodgkin-Huxley model with measurements  on 
cells.  For  example,  the  text  contains  data  on  the  effects  of many  external  parameters  (e.g.,  ionic 
concentrations,  cell  type)  on  action  potentials.  A  project  might  involve  reading  the  original  pa­
pers  that  describe  such measurements  (some  were  made  before  the  Hodgkin-Huxley model was 
formulated),  and  testing  the  hypothesis  that  these  measurements  are  (or  are  not)  consistent with 

1


the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Similarly, a project might involve examining the effect of some phar­
macological substance on measurements of the action potential and testing the hypothesis that the 
substance produces  its effect by changing one or another parameter of  the model.  These projects 
will require some reading of original literature which is often difﬁcult and usually time consuming. 
However,  such  a  project  can  lead  to  a  very  rewarding  educational  experience.  Alternatively,  the 
project might involve a purely theoretical topic in which some property of the model is explained 
in  terms of  its underlying structure.  This  type of project does not necessarily  involve reading  the 
original literature. 

Examples of hypotheses 

1.  Hypothesis — The effect of temperature on the conduction velocity of the squid giant axon 
can  be  ﬁt  by  the Hodgkin-Huxley model.  Articles  in  the  literature  should be  consulted  for 
this project: 
•	 Chapman, R. A. (1967).  Dependence on temperature of the conduction velocity of the 
action potential of the squid giant axon.  J. Physiol.  213:1143-1144. 
•	 Easton, D. M. and Swenberg, C. E. (1975).  Temperature and impulse velocity in giant 
axon of squid loligo pealei. Am.  J. Physiol. 229:1249-1253. 

2.  Hypothesis — When  two  action  potentials  are  elicited,  one  just  after  another,  the  velocity 
of  the  second  is  slower  than  the  velocity  of  the  ﬁrst  action  potential.  This  phenomenon  is 
predicted  by  the Hodgkin-Huxley model.  Articles  in  the  literature  should  be  consulted  for 
this project: 
•	 George, S. A., Mastronarde, D. N., and Dubin, M. W. (1984).  Prior activity inﬂuences 
the velocity of impulses in frog and cat optic nerve ﬁbers. Brain Res.  304:121-126. 

3.  Hypothesis —  The  threshold  current  for  eliciting  an  action  potential  with  an  intracellular 
electrode is higher for a space-clamped than for an unclamped model of an axon. 

4.  Hypothesis — Increasing the membrane capacitance will decrease the conduction velocity. 

5.  Hypothesis — Increasing the membrane conductance (by scaling all the ionic conductances) 
will increase the conduction velocity. 

6.  Hypothesis — Increasing the external concentration of sodium will increase the conduction 
velocity. 

7.  Hypothesis — Increasing the external concentration of potassium will increase the conduc­
tion velocity. 

8.  Hypothesis — Increasing the external concentration of calcium will increase the conduction 
velocity. 

9.  Hypothesis — Increasing the temperature will increase the conduction velocity. 

10.  Hypothesis — The difference in waveform of the action potential of a frog node of Ranvier 
and  of  a  squid  giant  axon  (Figure  1.9  in  volume  2  of  the  text)  can  be  reproduced  by  the 
Hodgkin-Huxley model of a squid giant axon by a change in temperature.

11.  Hypothesis — The membrane capacitance determines the time course of the rising phase of 
the action potential.  Increasing  the membrane capacitance decreases  the rate of  increase of 
the rising phase of the action potential. 

12.  Hypothesis  —  The  falling  phase  of  the  action  potential  (repolarization)  can  occur  in  the 
absence of a change in potassium conductance. 

13.  Hypothesis —  Increasing  the  temperature  sufﬁciently  blocks  the  occurrence  of  the  action 
potential because  the membrane  time  constant  limits  the  rate  at which  the membrane  vari­
ables  can  change  and  prevents  the  difference  in  time  course  of  the  sodium  and  potassium 
activation which is responsible for initiation of the action potential. 

14.  Hypothesis — The initiation of the action potential is independent of the potassium conduc­
tance. 

15.  Hypothesis — The prolonged plateau of the cardiac muscle action potential can be accounted 
for by the Hodgkin-Huxley model with a potassium conductance that has a slow activation. 

16.  Hypothesis — The effect of  tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) on  the action potential of 
the squid giant axon can be modelled with the Hodgkin Huxley model by decreasing Kn  and 
increasing Kh . Articles in the literature should be consulted for this project: 
•	 Armstrong,  C. M.  (1966).  Time  course  of  TEA+ -induced  anamalous  rectiﬁcation  in 
squid giant axons.  J. Gen. Physiol.  50:491-503. 
•	 Armstrong, C. M. and Binstock, L. (1965).  Anomalous rectiﬁcation in the squid giant 
axon injected with tetraethylammonium chloride.  J. Gen. Physiol. 48:859-872. 
•	 Tasaki, I. and Hagiwara, S. (1957).  Demonstration of two stable potential states in the 
squid giant axon under tetraethylammonium chloride.  J. Gen. Physiol.  40:859-885. 

17.  Hypothesis — The shape of the action potential in the presence of tetraethylammonium chlo­
ride  (TEA)  can  be  accounted  for  by  the Hodgkin-Huxley model with  a  reduced maximum 
value  of  the  potassium  conductance.  Articles  in  the  literature  should  be  consulted  for  this 
project: 
•	 Armstrong,  C. M.  (1966).  Time  course  of  TEA+ -induced  anamalous  rectiﬁcation  in 
squid giant axons.  J. Gen. Physiol.  50:491-503. 
•	 Armstrong, C. M. and Binstock, L. (1965).  Anomalous rectiﬁcation in the squid giant 
axon injected with tetraethylammonium chloride.  J. Gen. Physiol. 48:859-872. 
•	 Tasaki, I. and Hagiwara, S. (1957).  Demonstration of two stable potential states in the 
squid giant axon under tetraethylammonium chloride.  J. Gen. Physiol.  40:859-885. 

18.  Hypothesis — Increasing the external calcium concentration will block the occurrence of the 
action  potential  because  this will  reduce  the  difference  in  the  time  constant  of  sodium and 
potassium activation which is responsible for the initiation of the action potential. 

19.  Hypothesis — Increasing the external concentration of potassium will decrease the refractory 
period; decreasing this concentration will lengthen the refractory period. 

20.  Hypothesis —  Increasing  the external concentration of  sodium will decrease  the  refractory 
period; decreasing this concentration will lengthen the refractory period. 

3 

21.  Hypothesis — Absolute and relative refractory periods are decreased by increasing the rate 
constants for sodium inactivation and for potassium activation. 

22.  Hypothesis — Repolarization cannot occur if the potassium activation rate constant is zero. 

23.  Hypothesis — The  threshold of  the action potential  to a  brief pulse of current decreases  as 
the external potassium current is increased. 

24.  The Hodgkin-Huxley model with default parameters does not exhibit accommodation.  Hy­
pothesis — Accommodation occurs if the leakage conductance is increased. 

25.  The Hodgkin-Huxley model with default parameters does not exhibit accommodation.  Hy­
pothesis — Accommodation occurs if the potassium conductance is increased. 

26.  Hypothesis — Increasing the leakage equilibrium potential will block the action potential. 

27.  Hypothesis — The effect  of  the changes  in concentration of  sodium  ions on  the action po­
tential  of  the  giant  axon  of  the  squid  can  be  accounted  for  by  the Hodgkin-Huxley model. 
Articles in the literature should be consulted for this project:

of the giant axon of the squid.  J. Physiol. 108:37-77. 
•	 Baker, P. F., Hodgkin, A. L., and Shaw, T. I. (1961). Replacement of the protoplasm of 
a giant nerve ﬁbre with artiﬁcial solutions. Nature 190:885-887. 

28.  Hypothesis  —  In  response  to  rectangular  pulses  of  current,  the  rheobase  of  the  strength-
duration relation increases as temperature increases. 

29.  Hypothesis — An increase in temperature results in a decrease in the duration of the refrac­
tory period. 

30.  Hypothesis — The threshold membrane potential at which the Hodgkin-Huxley model pro­
duces  an  action  potential  in  response  to  a  brief  pulse  of  current  is  equal  to  the membrane 
potential for which the linearized Hodgkin-Huxley equations have unstable eigenvalues. 

31.  Application  of  a  long-duration  constant  current  to  the  Hodgkin-Huxley model  produces  a 
train  of  action  potentials.  Hypothesis —  The  frequency  of  the  action  potentials  increases 
with increasing current amplitude. 

32.  Application  of  a  long-duration  constant  current  to  the  Hodgkin-Huxley model  produces  a 
train of action potentials.  Hypothesis — The  frequency of action potential increases as  the 
parameter Kn  is increased. 

33.  Application  of  a  long-duration  constant  current  to  the  Hodgkin-Huxley model  produces  a 
train of action potentials.  Hypothesis — The  frequency of action potential increases as  the 
temperature is increased. 

34.  Hypothesis — An increase in the external concentration of potassium increases the threshold 
potential at which an action potential is elicited. 

35.  Hypothesis — Increasing Kh  will result in an increase in the steepness of the repolarization 
phase of the action potential.

Any  of  these  (or  other)  hypotheses  can  be  the  starting  point  for  a  project.  Most  of  the  hy­
potheses given above are simplistic, and a careful investigation will reveal their shortcomings. The 
Hodgkin-Huxley  model  is  sufﬁciently  complex  that  investigation  of  any  of  the  hypotheses  will 
most likely lead  to unexpected results.  You should pursue these unexpected results and  try to un­
derstand  their bases.  For example, you may ﬁnd  that  in pursuing some hypothesis you choose  to 
change  some parameter of  the model  that you expect  to  result  in some change  in action potential 
waveform.  The  resulting  computation might  reveal,  much  to  your  surprise  and  chagrin,  that  no 
action potential has occurred.  Determine why no action potential occurred.  The explanation will 
usually be instructive. Your aim should be not simply to reject or accept the hypothesis but to delve 
into the topic in sufﬁcient depth so as to a deepen your understanding of the model. One outcome 
of the project might be to restate your original hypothesis in a new and more sophisticated form. 
Beginning  with  the  proposal  and  extending  through  the  project,  you  should  keep  clearly  in 
mind  that  you  are  not  investigating  nerve  membrane  in  these  exercises.  You  are  investigating 
the  Hodgkin-Huxley  model  for  nerve  membrane.  Your  explanations  of  all  phenomena  must  be 
in  terms of  the  primitive concepts of  this model —  the  ionic  conductances,  ionic concentrations, 
ionic currents, the capacitance, and the variables m, n, and h.  Explanations in terms of molecular 
channel mechanisms or electrodiffusion of ions in the membrane are irrelevant in so far as they are 
not contained in the Hodgkin-Huxley model!
