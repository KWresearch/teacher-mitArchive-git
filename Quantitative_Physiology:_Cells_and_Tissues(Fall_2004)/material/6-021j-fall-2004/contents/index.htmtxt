reservoirs, combine, and mix by diffusion as they flow along the center
channel. The upper left image is a magnified view showing diffusion where the

***** Course Description *****
In this subject, we consider two basic topics in cellular biophysics, posed
here as questions:
   1. Which molecules are transported across cellular membranes, and what are
      the mechanisms of transport? How do cells maintain their compositions,
      volume, and membrane potential?
   2. How are potentials generated across the membranes of cells? What do these
      potentials do?
Although the questions posed are fundamentally biological questions, the
methods for answering these questions are inherently multidisciplinary. As we
will see throughout the course, the role of mathematical models is to express
concepts precisely enough that precise conclusions can be drawn. In connection
with all the topics covered, we will consider both theory and experiment. For
the student, the educational value of examining the interplay between theory
and experiment transcends the value of the specific knowledge gained in the
subject matter.
This course is jointly offered through four departments, available to both
undergraduates and graduates.
