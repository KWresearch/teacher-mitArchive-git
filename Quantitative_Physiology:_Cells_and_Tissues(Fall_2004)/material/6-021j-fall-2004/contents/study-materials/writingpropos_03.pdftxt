Tips to Writing a Successful Proposal for 6.021J 
Adapted from the Mayfield Handbook of Technical & Scientific Writing and the 6.021J proposal handout 

Goals: 
Proposals develop a plan of action in response to a specific need or problem.  In content, successful 
proposals demonstrate that you understand the scope of the problem and that you have developed a valid 
and well-focused approach for reaching proposed objectives. 

The goal in writing proposals is to effectively communicate a plan of action in concise, specific language. 

•	
Think through your research project before writing. Exactly what are you testing? Why? How? 
•	 Avoid universal words like "all" and "every" as well as vague words like "some" and "a few." 
•	 Also, make sure you understand the technical meaning of words like "control" before suggesting that 
an initial measurement will be your "control." (If you are unsure about usage of the term "control" see 
the frog lab handout provided in class for a technical definition.) 
•	 A good rule of thumb when writing a proposal is the "peer test" -- i.e. based on your written proposal, 
can your colleague, friend, or roommate understand exactly what you are doing? Can they restate your 
research project in one sentence? 

Format: 
•	
Single-spaced 
•	 One page 

Organization: 
Most proposals share a general structure, including title, obj ective, background, and proposed research 
plan. See the Mayfield Handbook of Scientific and Technical Writing  (Section 2.6) for a description of 
elements found in professional proposals. 

For your 6.021J proposal, you do not need to submit a proposal with all the elements of a professional 
proposal. However, your proposal does need to include certain basic elements: 
•	
Title 
Often the title is the only basis on which readers decide if your work  will be useful to them. Make 
your title descriptive enough to give a specific idea of what is covered in the proposal. 

WEAK: Effects of Alcohol on a Frog Sciatic Nerve 
What kind of effects? What exactly is this proposal suggesting to research? 

BETTER: The Relationship Between Amplitude of the Compound Action Potential and Diameter of 
the Frog Sciatic Nerve 

•	 Name 
Your name and the name of your partner (with your email addresses) 

•	 Hypothesis 
The hypothesis should state -- in one sentence -- exactly what you are testing. That statement should 
be answerable with "yes" or "no" 

WEAK: We predict that the speed and amplitude of the compound action potential of the frog sciatic 
nerve will both change with temperature 
This hypothesis cannot be answered "yes" or "no." In addition, it is not clear what kind of response 
the researchers are studying, as the wording "change with temperature" is too vague. 

BETTER: Decreasing temperature will decrease the velocity of the compound action potential of the

•  Background 
The background statement should explain the motivating problem or rationale for pursuing a research 
project. The background statement should clearly articulate the reasoning behind your hypothesis. 

WEAK: The speed of a chemical reaction depends on temperature. Therefore, we expect the speed of 
the compound action potential to depend on temperature. Also, the duration will depend on 
temperature. Finally, the amplitude of the compound action potential should depend on temperature. 
This statement is too general.  What do the researchers mean when they write "depend on"? How do 
these three expectations lead the researchers to the hypothesis? 

BETTER: Decreasing temperature decreases the rates at which many chemical reactions proceed. 
Therefore, it seems plausible that the speed of neural conduction would decrease as temperature 
decreases. 

•  Procedure 
The procedure should present your method for reaching your stated hypothesis. What kind of data 
will you collect? How will that data be analyzed? Even the most promising research will fall flat if 
you cannot design a scientifically valid way  to investigate it. 

WEAK: We will measure the compound action potential as described in the Laboratory Manual but 
at a variety of temperatures. We will record action potentials for all conditions and compare them. 
This procedure does not clearly outline the research method. The researchers are unclear about how 
they will conduct their study and what they will do with their data. Where will action potentials be 
recorded? What will be compared and how? How will these measurements help test the hypothesis? 

BETTER: After dissecting the sciatic nerve from a frog, we will stimulate the nerve and measure the 
responses as outlined in the lab manual. The velocity of the compound action potential will be 
determined by dividing the distance between the stimulating and recording electrodes by the time to 
the first negative peak of the response potential. The distance between the stimulus and the response 
electrodes will be made as large as possible (using R11 and R12 if the nerve is long enough) to 
improve the accuracy of the velocity measures (by minimizing the effects of small errors in measuring 
times and distances). After determining the velocity at room temperature, we will chill the nerve by 
applying chilled Ringer's solution. We will then measure and record the compound action potential. 
We will then apply room-temperature Ringer's solution to see if the effects of chilling are reversible. 
We will then repeat this procedure at least 3 times to make sure that the effects are, in fact, due to the 
chilling.
