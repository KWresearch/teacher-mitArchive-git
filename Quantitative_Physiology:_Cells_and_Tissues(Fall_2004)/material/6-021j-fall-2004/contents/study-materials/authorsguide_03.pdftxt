6.021J AUTHOR GUIDELINES 


CONTENT:  A lab report in 6.021J Quantitative Physiology is a description and analysis of your 
research. The primary audience of your report is other 6.021J students. It is expected that your research 
was jointly conducted and authored. We do not expect you to reach grand theories or expect all your 
research to be successful. We do expect you to offer a rationale that explains why this research is 
relevant, provide a detailed and accurate methodology description, disclose your results, and discuss 
reasons why your experiment succeeded or failed by linking that discussion to your results and methods. 

STYLE:  We prefer an informal but not colloquial style of writing to a textbook style or jargon-laden 
prose. You may use occasional instances of personal pronouns in your report. Your readers, the students 
and faculty of this course, all have some background in this subject, but only a very small percentage are 
experts. A clear conceptual discussion is far better than a plethora of technical details that have no over-
arching meaning or organization. 

MANUSCRIPT FORMATTING: All pages should be numbered, beginning with the first page of the 
report body.  Please include a Cover Page that includes authors« names as well as title of your report and 
submission date. Please include your Abstract on this Cover Page. Do not number the Cover Page. Every 
report needs to include in the body the following major section headings: Introduction, Methods, Results, 
Discussion. Within each of these sections, you may use more descriptive subheadings. A Table of 
Contents is optional. 

LENGTH:  Please limit your reports to 3,500 words. We prefer single-spaced texts with clear page 
breaks. Appendices are not included in the word count limit. Avoid lengthy Appendices as most readers 
will not read them carefully. 

FIGURES: We recognize that sometimes ƒa picture is worth a thousand words,≈ but avoid the gratuitous 
use of figures in your results.  Five to 10 figures should be sufficient for your report. Use figures to 
synthesize results and show trends or comparisons across findings. Integrate your figures with your text 
to create a ƒstory≈ between text and figure. Large figures should not run across pages. Each figure needs 
to be numbered and include a caption and label. Please ƒclean up≈ your figures from MatLab by 
removing unnecessary grid lines and shading. In addition, please make figures legible by using a 10 or 
12-point font size for captions and axis labels. 

REFERENCES:  You need at least one reference for your report. Most 6.021J students reference the 
Weiss text. Many reports also include references to research in the Introduction. 

FURTHER RESOURCES: 6.021J has its own Report and Proposal Guide which is available in the 
study materials section. This guide is a supplement to the MIT style guide, The Mayfield 
Handbook of Technical and Scientific Writing. 
SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS: Please see the calendar section for report due dates.
 
First Drafts: Include three copies of your report. Copies will be distributed to peer reviewers as 
specified in lecture. All reviews are returned during the writing clinic. Please make sure that your review 
of your peer«s report is complete and ready to be returned at the writing clinic. 
Final Reports: (7 items) Include one clean copy of your report, the three reviewed copies of your report, 
a copy of the report you critiqued, a copy of your lab protocol, and proposal. Clip or bind all materials 
together.
