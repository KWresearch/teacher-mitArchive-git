TEM waves on structures 

7.1.1 

Introduction 

Transmission  lines  typically  convey  electrical  signals  and  power  from  point  to  point  along 
arbitrary paths with high efficiency, and can also serve as circuit elements.  In most transmission 
lines,  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  point  purely  transverse  to  the  direction  of  propagation; 
such waves are called  transverse electromagnetic or TEM waves, and such  transmission  lines are 
called  TEM  lines.  The  basic  character  of TEM waves  is  discussed  in  Section  7.1,  the  effects  of 
junctions are introduced in Section 7.2, and the uses and analysis of TEM lines with junctions are 
treated in Section 7.3.  Section 7.4 concludes by discussing TEM lines that are terminated at both 
ends so as to form resonators. 

Transmission  lines  in  communications  systems  usually  exhibit  frequency-dependent 
behavior, so complex notation is commonly used.  Such lines are the subject of this chapter.  For 
broadband  signals  such  as  those  propagating  in  computers,  complex  notation  can  be  awkward 
and  the  physics  obscure.  In  this  case  the  signals  are  often  analyzed  in  the  time  domain,  as 
introduced  in  Section  7.1.2  and  discussed  further  in  Section  8.1.    Non-TEM  transmission  lines 
are commonly called waveguides; usually the waves propagate inside some conducting envelope, 
as  discussed  in  Section  9.3,  although  sometimes  they  propagate  partly  outside  their  guiding 
structure in an “open” waveguide such as an optical fiber, as discussed in Section 12.2. 

7.1.2  TEM waves between parallel conducting plates 

The  sinusoidal  uniform  plane  wave  of  equations  (7.1.1)  and  (7.1.2)  is  consistent  with  the 
presence of thin parallel conducting plates orthogonal to the electric field  E(z, t ) , as illustrated in 
Figure 7.1.1(a)31. 

E(z, t )  = xˆ E  o cos(  ωt − kz)   [V/m]

H(z, t ) = yˆ  o  cos( ωt − kz)   [A/m]

(7.1.2) 

Although perfect consistency requires that the plates be infinite, there is approximate consistency 
so  long  as  the  plate  separation  d  is  small  compared  to  the  plate width W  and  the  fringing  fields 
The  more  general  wave  E(z,t  ) = xˆE (x  z − ct  ) , 
outside 
the  structure  are  negligible. 
 
H (z,t )

zˆ
× E  z,t  ηo    is  also  consistent  [see  (2.2.13),  (2.2.18)],  since  any  arbitrary  waveform 
=
E(z  -  ct)  can  be  expressed  as  the  superposition  of  sinusoidal  waves  at  all  frequencies.    In  both 
cases  all  boundary  conditions  of  Section  2.6  are  satisfied  because  E //  = H⊥ = 0  at  the

conductors.  The  voltage  between  two  plates  v(z,t)  for  this  sinusoidal  wave  can  be  found  by 
integrating  E ( z, t )   over  the  distance  d  from  the  lower  plate,  which  we  associate  here  with  the 
voltage +v, to the upper plate:

Although this computed voltage v(t,z) does not depend on the path of integration connecting 
the  two  plates,  provided  it  is  at  constant  z,  it  does  depend  on  z  itself.    Thus  there  can  be  two 
different voltages between the same pair of plates at different positions z.  Kirchoff’s voltage law 
says  that  the sum of voltage drops around a loop is zero; this law is violated here because such a 
loop  in  the  x-z  plane  encircles  time  varying magnetic  fields,  H ( z, t ) ,  as  illustrated.    In  contrast, 
 
 
the sum of voltage drops around a loop confined to constant z is zero because it circles no  ∂H t∂ 
;  therefore  the  voltage  v(z,t),  computed  by  integrating  E(z)   between  the  two  plates,  does  not 
depend  on  the  path  of  integration  at  constant  z.    For  example,  the  integrals  of  E • ds along
contours A and B in Figure 7.1.1(b) must be equal because the integral around the loop 1, 2, 4, 3, 
1 is zero and the path integrals within the perfect conductors both yield zero. 

If the electric and magnetic fields are zero outside the two plates and uniform between them, 
then  equal  and  opposite  currents  i(t,z)  flow  in  the  two  plates  in  the  ±z  direction.  The  surface 
current  is  determined  by  the  boundary  condition  (2.6.17):  Js  = nˆ × H  [A  m-1].    If  the  two 
conducting plates are spaced close together compared to their widths W so that d << W, then the 
fringing  fields  at  the plate  edges  can be neglected  and  the  total  current  flowing  in  the plates  can

(7.1.4)

If  the  integration  contour C  encircles  the  lower  plate  and  surface A  at  constant  z  in  a  clockwise 
(right-hand) sense with  respect  to  the +z axis as  illustrated  in Figure 7.1.1,  then  Dinˆ = 0  and  the 
current flowing in the +z direction in the lower plate is simply:

(7.1.5)

An equal and opposite current flows in the upper plate. 

Note that the computed current does not depend on the integration contour C chosen so long 
as C circles the plate at constant z.  Also, the current flowing into a section of conducting plate at 
z1  does  not  generally  equal  the  current  flowing  out  at  z2,  seemingly  violating Kirchoff’s  current 
law (the sum of currents flowing  into a node  is zero).   This inequality exists because any section 
of  parallel  plates  exhibits  capacitance  that  conveys  a  displacement  current  D t
∂   between  the 
∂
two  plates;  the  right-hand  side  of  Equation  (2.1.6)  suggests  the  equivalent  nature  of  the 
conduction current density  J  and the displacement current density  D t 
∂ .
∂

Such  a  two-conductor  structure  conveying waves  that  are  purely  transverse  to  the  direction 
of  propagation,  i.e.,  Ez  =  Hz  =  0,  is  called  a  TEM  transmission  line  because  it  is  propagating 
transverse  electromagnetic  waves  (TEM  waves).  Such  lines  generally  have  a  physical  cross-
section  that  is  independent of z.   This particular TEM  transmission  line  is called a parallel-plate 
TEM line. 

Because  there  are  no  restrictions  on  the  time  structure  of  a  plane  wave,  any  v(t)  can 
propagate  between  parallel  conducting  plates.  The  ratio  between  v(z,t)  and  i(z,t)  for  this  or  any 
other  sinusoidal  or  non-sinusoidal  forward  traveling wave  is  the  characteristic  impedance  Zo  of 
the TEM structure: 

v (

)
z, t  

(
) 
= Z [o   ohms  ]  
i   z, t   = ηod  W  
 
 

(characteristic impedance) 

(7.1.6)

In  the  special  case  d  =  W,  Zo  equals  the  characteristic  impedance  ηo  of  free  space,  377  ohms. 
Usually W >> d in order to minimize fringing fields, yielding Zo << 377. 

Since  the  two  parallel  plates  can  be  perfectly  conducting  and  lossless,  the  physical 
significance of Zo ohms may be unclear.   Zo  is defined as  the  ratio of  line voltage  to  line current 
for  a  forward  wave  only,  and  is  non-zero  because  the  plates  have  inductance  L  per  meter 
associated  with  the  magnetic  fields  within  the  line.    The  value  of  Zo  also  depends  on  the 
0.5
capacitance C per meter of  this structure.   Section 7.1.3 shows (7.1.59)  that Z
o = (L/C)
 for any 
lossless  TEM  line  and  (7.1.19)  shows  it  for  a  parallel-plate  line.    The  product  of  voltage  and 
current v(z,t)i(z,t)  represents power P(z,t)  flowing past any point z  toward  infinity;  this power  is 
not being converted to heat by resistive losses, it is simply propagating away without reflections. 

It  is  easy  to  demonstrate  that  the  power  P(z,t)  carried  by  this  forward  traveling wave  is  the 
same  whether  it  is  computed  by  multiplying  v  and  i,  or  by  integrating  the  Poynting  vector 
S = ×E H  [W m-2] over the cross-sectional area Wd of the TEM line: 

P  ( z, t  ) = v    ( z, t  ) i  ( z, t  ) = ⎡⎣ E    ( z, t  ) d  ⎤⎦ ⎡⎣ H  ( z, t  ) W  ⎤⎦ = ⎡⎣E  ( z, t  ) H     ( z, t  )⎦⎤Wd  = S Wd  

(7.1.7)

The differential equations governing v and i on TEM lines are easily derived from Faraday’s 
and Ampere’s laws for the fields between the plates of this line: 

∇ × E = − ( ∂ ∂  μ 
t ) H = yˆ ( ∂ ∂ z ) E x ( z, t
 

) 

 

∇ × H = ( ∂ ∂  ε 
t )  E = − xˆ ( ∂ ∂z  ) H y ( z, t

)

 

 

(7.1.8) 

(7.1.9)

Because  all  but  one  term  in  the  curl  expressions  are  zero,  these  two  equations  are  quite  simple. 
By substituting v = Exd (7.1.3) and i = HyW (7.1.5), (7.1.8) and (7.1.9) become: 

dv dz = − ( μ d  W ) ( 
) = −L  di dt 
di dt 

) ( dv dt 
di dz = − ( ε 
) = −C  dv dt 
W d 

(7.1.10) 

(7.1.11) 

where  we  have  used  the  expressions  for  inductance  per  meter  L  [Hy  m-1]  and  capacitance  per 
meter  C  [F  m-1]  of  a  parallel-plate  TEM  line  [see  (3.2.11)32  and  (3.1.10)].  This  form  of  the 
differential equations  in  terms of L and C applies  to any  lossless TEM  line, as  shown  in Section 
7.1.3. 

These  two  differential  equations  can  be  solved  for  v  by  eliminating  i.   The  current  i  can  be 
eliminated  by  differentiating  (7.1.10)  with  respect  to  z,  and  (7.1.11)  with  respect  to  t,  thus 
introducing d2i/(dt dz) into both expressions permitting its substitution.  That is: 

d 2 v  dz 2  = −Ld 2 

i ( dt  dz ) 

d 2 i ( dz  dt ) = −C 2
2 
  d  v  dt 

(7.1.12) 

(7.1.13) 

Combining these two equations by eliminating d2i/(dt dz) yields the wave equation: 

2  dt  2  =  με d v  
2  dz  2  = LC  d v  
2  dt  2  
d v  

(wave equation) 

(7.1.14) 

Wave  equations  relate  the  second  spatial  derivative  to  the  second  time  derivative  of  the 
same  variable,  and  the  solution  therefore  can  be  any  arbitrary  function  of  an  argument  that  has 
the same dependence on space as on  time, except for a constant multiplier.   That  is, one solution 
to (7.1.14) is: 

v z(  , t  ) = v (+ z − ct  ) 

(7.1.15)

where  v+  is  an  arbitrary  function  of  the  argument  ( z c− t )   and  is  associated  with  waves 
propagating in the +z direction at velocity c.  This is directly analogous to the propagating waves 

32  Note:  (3.2.11)  gives  the  total  inductance  L  for  a  length  D  of  line,  where  area  A  =  Dd.    The  inductance  per  unit 
length L = μd/W in both cases.

characterized  in  Figure  2.2.1  and  in  Equation  (2.2.9).    Demonstration  that  (7.1.15)  satisfies 
(7.1.14) for c = (με)-0.5 follows the same proof provided for (2.2.9) in (2.2.10–12). 

The  general  solution  to  (7.1.14)  is  any  arbitrary  waveform  of  the  form  (7.1.15)  plus  an 
independent arbitrary waveform propagating in the -z direction: 

v z(  , t  ) = v (+ z − ct  ) + v (− z +  ct  ) 

(7.1.16) 

The  general  expression  for  current  i(z,t)  on  a  TEM  line  can  be  found,  for  example,  by 
substituting  (7.1.16)  into  the  differential  equation  (7.1.11)  and  integrating  over  z.    Thus,  using 
the notation that v'(q) ≡ dv(q)/dq: 

di dz = −Cdv dt = cC ⎡v ′ (z − ct ) − v  ′ (z + ct )

(7.1.17)

(7.1.18) 

Equation  (7.1.18)  defines  the  characteristic  impedance  Zo  =  (cC)-1  =  L / C   for  the  TEM  line. 
Both the forward and backward waves alone have the ratio Zo between v and i, although the sign 
of i is reversed for the negative-propagating wave because a positive voltage then corresponds to 
a negative current.  These same TEM results are derived differently in Sections 7.1.3 and 8.1.1. 

The characteristic impedance Zo of a parallel-plate line can be usefully related using (7.1.18) 
to  the  capacitance  C  and  inductance  L  per  meter,  where  C  =  εW/d  and  L  =  μd/W  for  parallel-
plate structures (7.1.10–11):

All  lossless TEM  lines have  this  simple  relationship, as  seen  in  (8.3.9)  for R = G = 0.    It  is  also 
consistent with (7.1.6), where ηo = 1/cε = (μo/εo)0.5.

(7.1.32) 

The behavior of these arbitrary waveforms at TEM junctions is discussed in the next section 
and  the  practical  application  of  these  general  solutions  for  arbitrary  waveforms  is  discussed 
further  in  Section  8.1.  Their  practical  application  to  sinusoidal  waveforms  is  discussed  in 
Sections 7.2–4. 

Example 7.1A 
A certain TEM  line consists of  two parallel metal plates  that are 10 cm wide, separated  in air by 
d = 1 cm, and extremely long.  A voltage v(t) = 10 cos ωt volts is applied to the plates at one end 
(z  =  0).    What  currents  i(t,z)  flow?    What  power  P(t)  is  being  fed  to  the  line?    If  the  plate 
resistance  is  zero,  where  is  the  power  going?   What  is  the  inductance  L  per  unit  length  for  this 
line? 

Solution:	

In  a  TEM  line  the  ratio  v/i  =  Zo  for  a  single  wave,  where  Zo  =  ηod/W  [see  (7.1.6)], 
and η  = (μ/ε)0.5  ≅ 377 ohms in air.  Therefore i(t,z) = Z -1
o v(t,z) = (W/dηo)10 cos(ωt -
o
kz)  ≅  [0.1/(0.01×377)]  10  cos(ωt  -  kz)  ≅ 0.27  cos[ω(t  -  z/c)]  [A].    P  =  vi  =  v2/Zo  ≅ 
2.65  cos2[ω(t  -  z/c)]  [W].    The  power  is  simply  propagating  losslessly  along  the  line 
toward  infinity.    Since  c  =  (LC)-0.5  =  3×108,  and  Zo  =  (L/C)0.5  ≅ 37.7,  therefore  L  = 
Zo/c = 1.3×10-7 [Henries m-1]. 

7.1.3  TEM waves in non-planar transmission lines 

TEM  waves  can  propagate  in  any  perfectly  conducting  structure  having  at  least  two  non-
contacting  conductors  with  an  arbitrary  cross-section  independent  of  z,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
7.1.2, if they are separated by a uniform medium characterized by ε, μ, and σ.  The parallel plate 
TEM  transmission  line  analyzed  in  Section  7.1.2  is  a  special  case  of  this  configuration,  and  we 
shall  see  that  the  behavior  of  non-planar  TEM  lines  is  characterized  by  the  same  differential 
equations  for  v(z,t)  and  i(z,t),  (7.1.10)  and  (7.1.11),  when  expressed  in  terms  of  L  and  C.    This 
result follows from the derivation below. 

We first divide the del operator into its transverse and longitudinal (z-axis) components:

where  ∇ ≡T

∇ × H = ∇  × T H T  + ( ∂ ∂z  ) ( zˆ × H T ) = σE   T  + ε∂E   T  ∂t

(7.1.34)

(7.1.35) 

The  right-hand sides of  these  two equations have no  zˆ  components, and  therefore  the  transverse 
curl components on the left-hand side are zero because they lie only along the z axis: 

∇ × E  = ∇ × 
T H  T  = 0 
T 
T

(7.1.36)

Moreover, the divergences of  ET  and  HT  are also zero since  z ˆ • HT  = •z ˆ  ET  = 0 ,  and: 

T • H T  + ( ∂ ∂z ) ( z ˆ • H T ) 
∇ • H 0=  = ∇ 
 
 
 

∇ • E   = ρ ε = 0 = ∇  • E T  + ( 
T

 ∂ ∂z  ) ( z ˆ • ET )

(7.1.37)
 

(7.1.38) 

Since the curl and divergence of  ET  and  HT  are zero, both these fields must independently 
satisfy  Laplace’s  equation  (4.5.7),  which  governs  electrostatics  and  magnetostatics;  these  field 
solutions  will  differ  because  their  boundary  conditions  differ.    Thus  we  can  find  the  transverse 
electric  and  magnetic  fields  for  TEM  lines  with  arbitrary  cross-sections  using  the  equation-
solving and field mapping methods described in Sections 4.5 and 4.6. 

The  behavior  of  E   and  H   for  an  arbitrary  TEM  line  can  be  expressed  more  simply  if  we 
first  define  the  line’s  capacitance  per meter C  and  the  inductance  per meter L.   C  is  the  charge  
Q'  per  unit  length  divided  by  the  voltage  v  between  the  two  conductors  of  interest,  and  L  is  the 
flux  linkage  Λ'  per  unit  length  divided  by  the  current  i.    Capacitance,  inductance,  and  flux 
linkage are discussed more fully in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

Figure 7.1.3  Integration paths for computing TEM line voltages and currents. 
 

To compute Q' and Λ' we consider a differential element of length δ along the z axis of the TEM 
line  illustrated  in  Figure  7.1.3,  and  then  compute  for  Q'  and  Λ',  respectively,  surface  and  line 
integrals  encircling  the  central  positively  charged  conducting  element  “a”  in  a  right-hand  sense 
relative  to  zˆ .  To  compute  the  voltage  v  we  integrate⎯ET  from  element  a  to  element  b,  and  to 
compute  the  current  i  we  integrate⎯HT  in  a  right-hand  sense  along  the  contour  C  circling 
conductor a:

We  can  readily prove  that  the voltage  and  current  computed using  line  integrals  in  (7.1.39– 
41)  do  not  depend  on  the  integration  path.    Figure  7.1.3  illustrates  two  possible  paths  of 
integration  for computing v within a plane corresponding  to a single value of z,  the paths ab and 
dc.  Since the curl of⎯ET is zero in the transverse plane we have:

To convert (7.1.45) into an equation in terms of v we can compute the line integral of  ET  from a

to  show

definition (7.1.43) of v, yields: 

∂i ( z, t  ) ∂z = − (G + C ∂ ∂

(7.1.51) 

This  pair  of  equations,  (7.1.49)  and  (7.1.51),  can  then  be  combined  to  yield  a  more  complete 
description of wave propagation on general TEM lines. 

Because  the  characteristic  impedance  and  phase  velocity  for  general  TEM  lines  are 
frequency dependent,  the  simple  solutions  (7.1.49) and  (7.1.51) are not convenient.    Instead  it  is 
useful to express them as complex functions of ω:

(7.1.54) 

The  solution  to  this  TEM wave  equation must  be  a  function  that  equals  a  constant  times  its 
own second derivative, such as: 

V ( )z  = V  − jkz  + V e+ jkz

(wave equation solution) 

(7.1.55) 

Substituting  this  assumed  solution  into  the  wave  equation  yields  the  dispersion  relation  for 
general TEM lines made with perfect conductors: 

k 2  = − j ωL  ( G

+ jωC  ) 
 

(TEM dispersion relation) 

(7.1.56)

This  equation  yields  a  complex  value  for  the  TEM  propagation  constant  k  =  k'  -  jk",  the 
significance  of  which  is  that  the  forward  (V+)  and  backward  (V-)  propagating  waves  are 
exponentially attenuated with distance: 

V ( )z  =  V e − jk ' z − k " z  + V e + jk ' z + k " z

The current can be found by substituting (7.1.57) into (7.1.53) to yield:

(7.1.59)

These expressions reduce to those for lossless TEM lines as G → 0. 

Another consequence of this dispersion relation (7.1.56) is that the TEM phase velocity vp is 
frequency dependent and thus most lossy lines are dispersive: 

vp  = ω

(7.1.60) 

Although most  TEM  lines  also  have  resistance R  per  unit  length,  this  introduces  Ez  ≠ 0,  so 
analysis  becomes  much  more  complex.    In  this  case  the  approximate  Telegrapher’s  equations 
(8.3.3–4) are often used. 

Example 7.1B 
What is the characteristic impedance Zo for the air-filled co-axial cable illustrated in Figure 7.1.3 
if the relevant diameters for the inner and outer conductors are a and b, respectively, where b/a = 
e?  “Co-axial” means cylinders a and b share the same axis of symmetry. 

Solution:  Zo  =  (L/C)0.5  from  (7.1.59).    Since  c  =  (LC)-0.5  it  follows  that  L  =  (c-2C-1)  and  Zo  = 
1/cC  ohms.    C  follows  from  (7.1.39),  which  requires  knowledge  of  the  transverse 
electric  field  ET   (for TEM waves,  there  are  no  non-transverse  fields).    Symmetry  in 
this cylindrical geometry requires  ET  = rˆEo  r .  Thus

7.1.4  Loss in transmission lines 

Transmission line losses can be computed in terms of the resistance R, Ohms per meter, of TEM 
line  length,  or  conductance  G,  Siemens/m,  of  the  medium  separating  the  two  conductors.  As 
discussed in Section 8.3.1, the time average power Pd dissipated per meter of length is simply the 
sum of the two contributions from the series and parallel conductances:

[ 
] = I z
( ) 
+ V ( )z
( )
 R 2  
P z W m

2 
 
G  2  

(7.1.61)

When  R  and  G  are  unknown,  resistive  losses  in  transmission  lines  can  be  estimated  by 
2
integrating  J 2σ [W  m-3]  over  the  volume  of  interest,  where  σ  is  the material  conductivity  [S 
m-1]  and  J   is  the  current  density  [A  m-2].  This  surface  loss  density  Pd  [W  m-2]  is  derived  for 
good  conductors  in  Section  9.2  and  is  shown  in  (9.2.61)  to  be  equal  to  the  power  dissipated  by

the same surface current Js flowing uniformly through a slab of thickness δ, where δ = (2/ωμσ)0.5 
is  the  skin depth.   The  surface current  J s  equals  Hs  , which  is  the magnetic  field parallel  to  the 
conductor surface.  Therefore:

For  example,  it  is  easy  to  compute  with  (7.1.62)  the  power  dissipated  in  a  50-ohm  copper 
TEM  coaxial  cable  carrying Po = 10 watts of  entertainment over  a 500-MHz band with  an  inner

conductor diameter of one millimeter.   First we note  that 
)0.5 
= (P
=  10,  and  2r =  10-3  [m].   Therefore 
2πr   [A/m]  ≅  142.  Also,  since  the  diameter 
 
 
H s 
/ Z
o
o 
of  the  outer  sheath  is  typically  ~5  times  that  of  the  inner  conductor,  the  surface  current  density 
there,  Js,  is  one  fifth  that  for  the  inner  conductor,  and  the  power  dissipation  per  meter  length  is 
also  one  fifth.  Therefore  the  total  power  dissipated  per  meter,  PL,  in  both  conductors  is  ~1.2 
times that dissipated in the inner conductor alone.  If we consider only the highest and most lossy 
frequency,  and  assume  σ  =  5×107,  then  substituting  H s  into  (7.1.62)  and  integrating  over  both 
conductors yields the power loss:

(7.1.64)

Thus  PL  is  0.48  watts/meter,  a  large  fraction  of  the  ten  watts  propagating  on  the  line.  This 
 
loss  of  4.8  percent  of  the  power  per  meter,  including  the  outer  conductor,  corresponds  to  10 
log10(1  -  0.048)  ≅  -0.21dB  per  meter.    If  we  would  like  amplifiers  along  a  cable  to  provide  no 
more  than  ~50  dB  gain, we  need  amplifiers  every  ~234 meters.   Dropping  the  top  frequency  to 
100 MHz,  or  increasing  the  diameter  of  the  central wire  could  reduce  these  losses  by  perhaps  a 
factor  of  ~4.    These  loss  issues  and  desires  for  broad  bandwidth  are  motivating  substitution  of 
low-loss optical fiber over long cable lines, and use of co-axial cables only for short hops from a 
local fiber to the home or business. 

Example 7.1C 
A  perfectly  conducting  50-ohm  coaxial  cable  is  filled  with  slightly  conducting  dielectric  that 
gives  the  line  a  shunt  conductivity  G  =  10-6  Siemens  m-1  between  the  two  conductors. What  is 
the attenuation of this cable (dB m-1)? 

- 197 -






Solution:  	 The  attenuation L[dB m-1] =  4.34 Pd/Po  (7.1.64), where  the  power  on  the  line Po  [W] 
=  |V|2/2Zo, and  the dissipation here  is Pd  [W m-1] =  |V|2G/2  (7.1.61);  see Figure 8.3.1 
for the incremental model of a lossy TEM transmission line.  Therefore L = 4.34 GZo 
=  2.2×10-4  dB  m-1.  This  is  generally  independent  of  frequency  and  therefore  might 
dominate  at  lower  frequencies  if  the  frequency-dependent  dissipative  losses  in  the 
wires become sufficiently small.

TEM lines with junctions 

7.2.1  Boundary value problems 

A  junction  between  two  transmission  lines  forces  the  fields  in  the  first  line  to  conform  to  the 
fields  at  the  second  line  at  the  boundary  between  the  two.    This  is  a  simple  example  of  a  broad 
class of problems called boundary value problems.  The general electromagnetic boundary value 
problem  involves  determining  exactly  which,  if  any,  combination  of  waves  matches  any  given 
set  of  boundary  conditions,  which  generally  includes  both  active  and  passive  boundaries,  the 
active  boundaries  usually  being  sources.    Boundary  conditions  generally  constrain  E   and/or  H 
for all time on the boundary of the one-, two- or three-dimensional region of interest. 

The  uniqueness  theorem  presented  in  Section  2.8  states  that  only  one  solution  satisfies  all 
Maxwell’s equations if the boundary conditions are sufficient. Therefore we may solve boundary 
value  problems  simply  by  hypothesizing  the  correct  combination  of waves  and  testing  it  against 
Maxwell’s  equations.  That  is, we  leave  undetermined  the  numerical  constants  that  characterize 
the  chosen  combination  of  waves,  and  then  determine  which  values  of  those  constraints  satisfy 
Maxwell’s  equations.  This  strategy  eases  the  challenge  of  hypothesizing  the  final  answer 
directly.  Moreover,  symmetry  and  other  considerations  often  suggest  the  nature  of  the  wave 
combination required by the problem, thus reducing the numbers of unknown constants that must 
be determined. 

The four basic steps for solving boundary value problems are: 

1)  Determine the natural behavior of each homogeneous section of the system without the 
boundaries. 

2)  Express  this  general  behavior  as  the  superposition  of  waves  or  static  fields 
characterized by unknown constants; symmetry and other considerations can minimize 
the number of waves required.  Here our basic building blocks are TEM waves. 

3)  Write  equations  for  the  boundary  conditions  that  must  be  satisfied  by  these  sets  of 
superimposed waves, and then solve for the unknown constants. 

4)  Test  the  resulting  solution  against  any  of  Maxwell’s  equations  that  have  not  already 
been imposed. 

- 198 -


Variations  of  this  four-step  procedure  can  be  used  to  solve  almost  any  problem  by  replacing 
Maxwell’s  equations  with  their  approximate  equivalent  for  the  given  problem  domain34.  For 
example,  profitability,  available  capital,  technological  constraints,  employee  capabilities,  and 
customer needs are often “boundary conditions” when deriving strategies for start-up enterprises, 
while  “natural  behavior”  could  include  the  probable  family  of  behaviors  of  the  entrepreneurial 
team and its customers, financiers, and suppliers. 

7.2.2  Waves at TEM junctions in the time domain 

The boundary value problem approach described  in Section 7.2.1 can be used for waves at TEM 
junctions.  We assume that an arbitrary incident wave will produce both reflected and transmitted 
waves.  For  this  introductory problem we  also  assume  that no waves are  incident  from  the other 
direction,  for  their  solution could be  superimposed  later.    Section 7.2.3  treats  the  same problem 
 
in  the  complex  domain.    We  represent  TEM  lines  graphically  by  parallel  lines  and  their 
characteristic impedance Zo, as illustrated in Figure 7.2.1 for lines a and b.

Step  one  of  the  boundary  value  method  involves  characterizing  the  natural  behavior  of 
waves  in  the  two  media  of  interest,  lines  a  and  b.    This  follows  from  (7.1.16)  for  v(z,t)  and 
(7.1.18)  for  i(z,t).    Step  two  involves  hypothesizing  the  form  of  the  reflected  and  transmitted 
waves,  v-(z,t)  and  vt(z,t).    For  simplicity  we  assume  the  source  v+(z,t)  is  on  the  left,  the  TEM 
junction is at z = 0, and the line impedances Zo are constants independent of time and frequency. 
Step  three  is  to  write  the  boundary  conditions  for  the  waves  with  unknown  constants;  v  and  i 
must both be constant across the junction at z = 0: 

v  ( z, t  )  = v + ( z, t  )  + v − ( z, t  ) = v t  ( z, t  )

⎣⎡ v+ ( z, t )  − v − ( z, t )⎦⎤ =  Z −1

(7.2.2) 

Step four  involves solving (7.2.1) and (7.2.2) for  the unknown waves v-(z,t) and vt(z,t).   We 
can  simplify  the  problem  by  taking  the  ratios  of  reflection  and  transmission  relative  to  the 
incident wave and provide its amplitude later.  If we regard the arguments (z=0, t) as understood, 
then (7.2.1) and (7.2.2) become: 

34  A  key  benefit  of  a  technical  education  involves  learning  precise  ways  of  thinking  and  solving  problems;  this 
procedure, when generalized, is an excellent example applicable to almost any career.

(7.2.4)

To make  the algebra for  these  two equations still more transparent it is customary to define v-/v+ 
as  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ,  vt/v+  as  the  transmission  coefficient  T,  and  Z Zo  = Zn  as  the
t 
normalized impedance for line b.  Note that v-, v+, Zo, and Zt are real, and the fraction of incident 
power that is reflected from a junction is  Γ 2 .  Equations (7.2.3) and (7.2.4) then become:

The transitions to (7.2.9) and (7.2.10) utilized the fact that if two functions of two arguments 
are  equal  for  all  values  of  their  arguments,  then  the  functions  remain  equal  as  their  arguments 
undergo  the  same  numerical  shifts.    For  example,  if  X(a)  =  Y(b)  where  a  and  b  have  the  same 
units,  then X(a +  c) = Y(b +  c).  Combining  (7.2.3)  and  (7.2.7)  yields  the  transmitted  voltage  vt 
in terms of the source voltage v+: 

v (t  z − ct ) = ⎡⎣2Z n  ( Zn  + 1)⎤⎦ v (+ z − ct ) 

(7.2.11)
 

This completes the solution for signal behavior at single TEM junctions. 

Example 7.2A 
Two parallel plates of width W and separation d1 = 1 cm are connected at z = D to a similar pair 
of  plates  spaced  only  d2  =  2 mm  apart.    If  the  forward wave  on  the  first  line  is Vo  cos(ωt  -  kz), 
what voltage vt(t,z) is transmitted beyond the junction at z = D? 

- 200 -


Solution:  vt(t,z)  =  Tv+(t,z)  =  (1  +  Γ)v+(t,z)  =  2Zn  v+(t,z)/(Zn  +  1),  where  Zn  =  Zt/Zo  = 
ηod2W/ηod1W  =  d2/d1  =  0.2.  Therefore  for  z  >  D,  vt(t,z)  =  v+(t,z)2×0.2/(0.2  +  1)  =

7.2.3 

Sinusoidal waves on TEM transmission lines and at junctions 

The  basic  equations  characterizing  lossless  TEM  lines  in  the  sinusoidal  steady  state  correspond 
to the pair of differential equations (7.1.25) and (7.1.26):   

dV z   dz  = − j ωL  I ( )z
( ) 

d I( )z   d z  = − jωC  V ( ) 

(7.2.12)
 

(7.2.13)
 

L and C are the inductance and capacitance of the line per meter, respectively. 

This pair of equations leads easily to the transmission line wave equation: 

d V z  dz  2  = −ω2LCV  ( )z  
2  ( )

 

(wave 
equation) 

(7.2.14)

The solution V(z) to this wave equation involves exponentials in z because the second derivative 
of V(z) equals a constant  times V(z).  The exponents can be + or  -,  so  in general a  sum of  these 
two  alternatives  is  possible,  where  V+  and  V-  are  complex  constants  determined  later  by 
boundary conditions and k is given by (7.1.30): 

V( )z  = V + e− jkz  + V −e+ jkz  [

(characteristic impedance) 

(7.2.18) 

The  characteristic  admittance  Yo  of  the  line  is  the  reciprocal  of Zo,  and  has  units  of Siemens  or 
ohms-1.  It  is  important  to  appreciate  the  physical  significance  of  Zo;  it  is  simply  the  ratio  of 
voltage  to  current  for  a wave  propagating  in  one  direction  only  on  the  line,  e.g.,  for  the  + wave 
only.  This  ratio does not correspond  to dissipative  losses  in  the  line, although  it  is  related  to  the 
power traveling down the line for any given voltage across the line.

When  there  are  both  forward  and  backward  waves  on  a  line,  the  voltage/current  ratio  is 
called  the  complex  impedance  and  varies  with  position,  as  suggested  in  Figure  7.2.2(a).    The 
impedance at any point along the line is defined as:

(7.2.20)

When z = 0 at the load, then V-/V+ is defined at the load and ΓL is the load reflection coefficient, 
denoted by the subscript L. 

Equation  (7.2.20)  leads  to  a  simple  algorithm  for  relating  impedances  at  different  points 
along the line.  We first define normalized impedance Zn and relate it to the reflection coefficient 
Γ(z) using (7.2.19); (7.2.22) follows from (7.2.21):

(7.2.22)

For example, we can see the effect of the load impedance ZL (z = 0) at some other point z on the 
line by using (7.2.20–22) in an appropriate sequence: 

Z L

 → Z Ln

 → Γ L

 → Γ(z) → Z n

(z) → Z (z )    (impedance transformation)  (7.2.23) 
 

A simple example of the use of (7.2.23) is the transformation of a 50-ohm resistor by a 100-ohm 
line  λ/4  long.   Using  (7.2.23)  in  sequence, we  see  ZL  =  50,  ZLn  =  50/100  =  0.5,  ΓL  =  -1/3  from 
(7.2.22), Γ(z = -λ/4) = +1/3 from (7.2.20) where e+2jkz = e2j(2π/λ)(-λ/4) = e-jπ = -1, Zn(-λ/4) = 2 from 
(7.2.21), and therefore Z(-λ/4) = 200 ohms.

Two  other  impedance  transformation  techniques  are  often  used  instead:  a  direct  equation 
and  the  Smith  chart  (Section  7.3).    The  direct  equation  (7.2.24)  can  be  derived  by  first 
substituting ΓL =  (ZL  - Zo)/(ZL + Zo  ),  i.e.  (7.2.22),  into Z(z) = V(z)/I(z), where V(z) and I(z) are 
given  by  (7.2.15)  and  (7.2.17),  respectively,  and  V-/V+  =  ΓL  .  The  next  step  involves  grouping 
the  exponentials  to  yield  sin  kz  and  cos  kz,  and  then  dividing  sin  by  cos  to  yield  tan  and  the 
solution:

(7.2.24) 

A  closely  related  problem  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.2.2(b)  where  two  transmission  lines  are 
connected  together  and  the  right-hand  line  presents  the  impedance  Zt  at  z  =  0.    To  illustrate  the 
general method  for solving boundary value problems outlined  in Section 7.2.1, we shall use  it  to 
compute  the  reflection  and  transmission  coefficients  at  this  junction.    The  expressions  (7.2.15) 
and (7.2.17) nearly satisfy the first two steps of that method, which involve writing trial solutions 
composed  of  superimposed  waves  with  unknown  coefficients  that  satisfy  the  wave  equation 
within each region of interest.  The third step is to write equations for these waves that satisfy the 
boundary  conditions,  and  then  to  solve  for  the  unknown  coefficients.    Here  the  boundary 
conditions  are  that  both  V  and  I  are  continuous  across  the  junction  at  z  =  0;  the  subscript  t 
corresponds  to  the  transmitted  wave.    The  two  waves  on  the  left-hand  side  have  amplitudes  V+ 
and V-, whereas  the wave on  the  right-hand side has amplitude Vt.  We assume no energy enters 
from the right.  Therefore:

(7.2.25)
 

(7.2.26)

We define  the  complex  reflection  and  transmission  coefficients  at  the  junction  (z = 0)  to be 
Γ and T, respectively, where: 

Γ = V− V+ 

T = V t V+ 

(complex reflection coefficient)

We may solve for Γ and T by first dividing (7.2.25) and (7.2.26) by V+:

This pair of equations is readily solved for Γ and T:

(7.2.32)
 

where  normalized  impedance was  defined  in  (7.2.21)  as  Zn  ≡ Zt/Zo.  For  example,  (7.2.31)  says 
that  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ  is  zero  when  the  normalized  impedance  is  unity  and  the  line 
impedance is matched, so Zt = Zo; (7.2.32) then yields T = 1. 

The  complex  coefficients  Γ and  T  refer  to wave  amplitudes,  but  often  it  is  power  that  is  of 
interest.  In general the time-average power incident upon the junction is:

Another consequence of having both forward and backward moving waves on a TEM line is 
that  the magnitudes of  the voltage and current vary along  the  length of  the  line.   The expression 
for voltage given in (7.2.15) can be rearranged as: 

V( )z  = V + e− jkz

(7.2.34)

The magnitude  of  |V+e-jkz|  is  independent  of  z,  so  the  factor  |1 + Γ(z)|  controls  the magnitude  of 
voltage  on  the  line,  where  Γ(z)  =  ΓLe2jkz  (7.2.20).  Figure  7.2.3(a)  illustrates  the  behavior  of 
|V(z)|;  it  is quasi-sinusoidal with period λ/2 because of  the 2jkz  in  the exponent.   The maximum 
value |V(z)|max = |V+| + |V-| occurs when Γ(z) = |Γ|; the minimum occurs when Γ(z) = - |Γ|.

The  origins  of  this  behavior  of  |V(z)|  is  suggested  in Figure  7.2.3(b), which  illustrates  the  z 
dependence of Γ(z)  in  the  complex gamma plane, where  the horizontal  and vertical  axes  are  the 
real  and  imaginary  parts  of  Γ(z),  respectively.    Increases  in  z  simply  rotate  the  vector  Γ(z) 
clockwise, preserving its magnitude [see (7.2.20) and Figure 7.2.3(b)]. 

The quasi-sinusoidal  form of  |V(z)| arises because  |V(z)| ∝ |1 + Γ(z)|, which  is  the  length of 
the vector linking Γ(z) with the point -1 on the gamma plane, as illustrated in Figure 7.2.3(b).  As 
the phase φ of Γ varies with z and circles the diagram, the vector 1 + Γ(z) varies as might an arm 
turning  a  crank,  and  so  it  is  sometimes  called  the  “crank  diagram”.   When  |Γ|  <<  1  then  |V(z)| 
resembles  a  weak  sinusoid  oscillating  about  a  mean  value  of  |V+|,  whereas  when  |Γ|  ≅ 1  then 
|V(z)|  resembles  a  fully  rectified  sinusoid.    The  voltage  envelope  |V(z)|  is  called  the  standing-
wave  pattern,  and  fields  have  a  standing-wave  component  when  |Γ|  >  0.  The  figure  also 
illustrates  how  |I(z)|  ∝ |1  - Γ(z)|  exhibits  the  same  quasi-sinusoidal  variation  as  |V(z)|,  but  180 
degrees out of phase. 

Because  |V(z)|  and  |I(z)|  are  generally  easy  to  measure  along  any  transmission  line,  it  is 
useful  to  note  that  such  measurements  can  be  used  to  determine  not  only  the  fraction  of  power 
that  has  been  reflected  from  any  load,  and  thus  the  efficiency  of  any  connection,  but  also  the 
impedance of the load itself.  First we define the voltage standing wave ratio or VSWR as:

VSWR  ≡ V z

( )

=  V + + V − ) V+ − V − ) = (1 + Γ  (1 − Γ )

(7.2.35)

Therefore: 

Γ = (VSWR − 1) ( VSWR + 1) 

) 2 
2  = [(VSWR  − 1) ( 
VSWR  + 1 ]
P P  
+ = Γ 
−

(7.2.36)
 

(7.2.37)

This  simple  relation  between VSWR  and  fractional  power  reflected  (P-/P+)  helped make VSWR 
a common specification for electronic equipment. 

To  find  the  load  impedance  ZL  from  observations  of  |V(z)|  such  as  those  plotted  in  Figure 
7.2.3(a)  we  first  associate  any  voltage  minimum  with  that  point  on  the  gamma  plane  that 
corresponds to -|Γ|.  Then we can rotate on the gamma plane counter-clockwise (toward the load) 
an  angle  φ =  2kD  =  4πD/λ  radians  that  corresponds  to  the  distance  D  between  that  voltage 
minimum  and  the  load,  where  a  full  revolution  in  the  gamma  plane  corresponds  to  D  =  λ/2. 
Once Γ for the load is determined, it follows from (7.2.21) that: 

ZL  = Zo [1 + Γ]  [1 − Γ] 

 

(7.2.38)
 

If more than two TEM lines join a single junction then their separate impedances combine in 
series  or  parallel,  as  suggested  in  Figure  7.2.4.    The  impedances  add  in  parallel  for  Figure 
7.2.4(a) so the impedance at the junction as seen from the left would be:

Figure  7.2.4(c)  illustrates  how  TEM  lines  can  be  concatenated.    In  this  case  the  impedance 
Z1  seen  at  the  left-hand  terminals  could  be  determined  by  transforming  the  impedance  ZL  at 
terminals (3) to the impedance Z2 that would be seen at terminals (2).  The impedance seen at (2) 
could  then  be  transformed  a  second  time  to  yield  the  impedance  seen  at  the  left-hand  end.    The 
algorithm for this might be: 

ZL → ZLn

 → Γ3 → Γ2 → Zn 2

 → Z2 → Zn 2'

 → Γ2' → Γ1 → Zn1

 → Z1 

(7.2.40) 

Note  that Zn2  is normalized with  respect  to Za and Zn2'  is normalized with respect  to Zo; both are 
defined  at  junction  (2).  Also,  Γ2  is  the  reflection  coefficient  at  junction  (2)  within  the  line  Za, 
and Γ2' is the reflection coefficient at junction (2) within the line Zo. 

Example 7.2B 
A 100-ohm air-filled TEM  line  is  terminated at z = 0 with a capacitor C = 10-11  farads.   What  is  
Γ(z)?  At what positions z < 0 are voltage minima located on the line when f = 1/2π GHz?  What 
is the VSWR?  At z = - λ/4, what is the equivalent impedance? 

Solution:  The normalized load impedance ZL/Zo  ≡ ZLn = 1/jωCZo = -j/(109×10-11×100) = -j, and 
2jkz
  =  -je2jkz. 
(7.2.22)  gives  Γ
L  =  (ZLn  -  1)/(ZLn  +  1)  =  -(1+j)/(1-j)  =  -j.  Γ(z)  =  ΓLe
(7.2.34) gives  |V(z)| ∝  |1 + Γ(z)| =  |1 -  je2jkz| = 0 when e2jkz = -j = e-j(π/2  + n2π), where n 
=0,1,2…  Therefore 2jkz =  -j(π/2 + n2π),  so z(nulls) =  -(π/2 + n2π)λ/4π =  -(λ/8)(1 + 
4n).  But f = 109/2π, and so λ = c/f = 2πc×10-9 = 0.6π [m].  (7.2.34) gives VSWR = (1 
+  |Γ|)/(1 -  |Γ|) = ∞.  At z =  -λ/4, Γ →  -ΓL = +j via  (7.2.20), so by  (7.2.38) Z = Zo[1 + 
Γ]/[1 - Γ] = 100[1 + j]/[1 - j] = j100 = jωLo ⇒ Lo = 100/ω = 100/109 = 10-7 [H].

Example 7.2C 
The VSWR observed on a 100-ohm air-filled TEM transmission line is 2.  The voltage minimum 
is 15 cm  from  the  load and  the distance between minima  is 30 cm.   What  is  the  frequency of  the 
radiation?  What is the impedance ZL of the load? 

Solution:	 The  distance  between  minima  is  λ/2,  so  λ  =  60  cm  and  f  =  c/λ  =  3×108/0.6  =  500 
MHz.  The load impedance is ZL = Zo[1 + ΓL]/[1 - ΓL] (7.2.38) where |ΓL| = (VSWR - 
1)/(VSWR  +  1)  =  1/3  from  (5.2.83).    ΓL  is  rotated  on  the  Smith  chart  180  degrees 
counter-clockwise  (toward  the  load)  from  the  voltage  minimum,  corresponding  to  a 
quarter wavelength.  The  voltage minimum must  lie  on  the  negative  real Γ  axis,  and 
therefore ΓL  lies  on  the  positive  real  Γ  axis.    Therefore  ΓL  =  1/3  and  ZL  =  100(1  + 
1/3)/(1 - 1/3) = 200 ohms. 

7.3  Methods for matching transmission lines 

7.3.1 

Frequency-dependent behavior 

This  section  focuses  on  the  frequency-dependent  behavior  introduced  by  obstacles  and 
impedance  transitions  in  transmission  lines,  including  TEM  lines,  waveguides,  and  optical 
systems.    Frequency-dependent  transmission  line  behavior  can  also  be  introduced  by  loss,  as 
discussed  in  Section  8.3.1,  and  by  the  frequency-dependent  propagation  velocity  of waveguides 
and optical fibers, as discussed in Sections 9.3 and 12.2. 

The  basic  issue  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.3.1(a), where  an  obstacle  reflects  some  fraction  of 
the  incident  power.    If  we  wish  to  eliminate  losses  due  to  reflections  we  need  to  cancel  the 
reflected wave by adding another that has the same magnitude but is 180° out of phase.  This can 
easily  be  done  by  adding  another  obstacle  in  front  of  or  behind  the  first  with  the  necessary 
properties,  as  suggested  in  (b).  However,  the  reflections  from  the  further  obstacle  can  bounce 
between the two obstacles multiple times, and the final result must consider these additional rays 
too.  If  the  reflections are  small  the multiple  reflections become negligible.   This  strategy works 
for any type of transmission line, including TEM lines, waveguides and optical systems.

The most  important  consequence of  any  such  tuning  strategy  to  eliminate  reflections  is  that 
the  two  reflective  sources  are  often  offset  spatially,  so  the  relative  phase  between  them  is 
wavelength  dependent.    If  multiple  reflections  are  important,  this  frequency  dependence  can 
increase  substantially.   Rather  than  consider  all  these  reflections  in  a  tedious way, we  can more 
directly  solve  the  equations  by  extending  the  analysis  of  Section  7.2.3,  which  is  summarized 
below  in  the  context  of  TEM  lines  having  characteristic  admittance  Yo  and  a  termination  of 
complex impedance ZL:

Zn can be  related  to Γ(z) by dividing  (7.3.1) by  (7.3.2)  to  find Z(z), and  the  inverse  relation 
(7.3.3) follows.  Using (7.3.3) and (7.3.4) in the following sequences, the impedance Z(z2) at any 
point on an unobstructed line can be related to the impedance at any other point z1: 

Z(

)z 1 ⇔ Z n (

)z1  ⇔ Γ(

)z1  ⇔ Γ(z 2 ) ⇔ Zn (z 2 ) ⇔ Z(z 2 ) 

(7.3.5) 

The  five  arrows  in  (7.3.5)  correspond  to  application  of  equations  (7.3.3)  and  (7.3.4)  in  the 
following left-to-right sequence: (4), (3), (3), (4), (4), respectively. 

One standard problem involves determining Z(z) (for z < 0) resulting from a load impedance 
ZL at z = 0.  One approach  is  to  replace  the operations  in (7.3.5) by a single equation, derived  in 
(7.2.24): 

Z( )z = Z  (ZL  − jZ  tan kz )
o

(Z o  − jZ  tan kz )

 (impedance transformation) 

(7.3.6)

For example, if ZL = 0, then Z(z) = -jZo tan kz, which means that Z(z) can range between -j∞ and 
+j∞,  depending  on  z, mimicking  any  reactance  at  a  single  frequency.   The  impedance  repeats  at 
distances of Δz = λ, where k(Δz) = (2π/λ)Δz = 2π.  If ZL = Zo, then Z(z) = Zo everywhere. 

Example 7.3A 
What is the impedance at 100 MHz of a 100-ohm TEM line λ/4 long and connected to a: 1) short 
circuit?  2) open circuit?  3) 50-ohm resistor? 4) capacitor C = 10-10 F?

Solution:	

In all  four cases  the  relation between Γ(z = 0) = ΓL at  the  load, and Γ(z =  -λ/4)  is  the 
same  [see  (7.3.3)]: Γ(z =  -λ/4) = Γ e2jkz = Γ e2j(2π/λ)(-λ/4)
 =  - ΓL.  Therefore  in  all  four

these four cases  is: 0, ∞, 0.5, and 1/jωCZ

7.3.2 

Smith chart, stub tuning, and quarter-wave transformers 

A common problem is how to cancel reflections losslessly, thus forcing all incident power into a 
load.  This  requires addition of one or more  reactive  impedances  in  series or  in parallel with  the 
line so as  to convert  the  impedance at  that point  to Zo, where  it must  remain  for all points closer 
to the source or next obstacle.  Software tools to facilitate this have been developed, but a simple 
graphical tool, the Smith chart, provides useful insight into what can easily be matched and what 
cannot.  Prior to computers it was widely used to design and characterize microwave systems.   

The  key  operations  in  (7.3.5)  are  rotation  on  the  gamma  plane  [Γ(z1)  ⇔  Γ(z2)]  and  the 
conversions  Zn  ⇔  Γ,  given  by  (7.3.3–4).  Both  of  these  operations  can  be  accommodated  on  a 
single  graph  that  maps  the  one-to-one  relationship  Zn  ⇔  Γ  on  the  complex  gamma  plane,  as 
suggested  in  Figure  7.3.2(a).    Conversions  Γ(z1)  ⇔  Γ(z2)  are  simply  rotations  on  the  gamma 
plane.  The  gamma  plane  was  introduced  in  Figure  7.2.3.    The  Smith  chart  simply  overlays  the 
equivalent  normalized  impedance  values  Zn  on  the  gamma  plane;  only  a  few  key  values  are 
indicated  in  the simplified version shown  in (a).   For example,  the  loci for which  the real Rn and 
imaginary parts  Xn of Zn remain constant lie on segments of circles (Zn  ≡ Rn + jXn) .

Rotation  on  the  gamma  plane  relates  the  values  of  Zn  and  Γ at  one  z  to  their  values  at 
another,  as  suggested  in Figure 7.3.2(b).  Since Γ(z) =  (V-/V+)e2jkz = ΓLe2jkz = ΓLe-2jk(cid:65),  and  since 
ejφ corresponds  to  counter-clockwise  rotation  as φ  increases, movement  toward  the generator  (-z 
direction)  corresponds  to  clockwise  rotation  in  the  gamma  plane.    The  exponent  of  e-2jk(cid:65)  is  ­
j4π(cid:65)/λ,  so  a  full  rotation  on  the  gamma  plane  corresponds  to movement  (cid:65)  down  the  line  of  only 
λ/2. 

A simple example  illustrates  the use of  the Smith chart.   Consider an  inductor having  jωL = 
j100 on a 100-ohm  line.   Then Zn =  j, which corresponds  to a point at  the  top of  the Smith chart 
where Γ = +j (normally Zn  ≠ Γ).  If we move toward the generator λ/4, corresponding to rotation 
of Γ(z) half way  round  the Smith chart,  then we arrive at  the bottom where Zn = -j and Z = ZoZn 
= -j100 = 1/jωC.  So the equivalent capacitance C at the new location is 1/100ω farads. 

The  Smith  chart  has  several  other  interesting  properties.    For  example,  rotation  half  way 
round  the  chart  (changing  Γ to  - Γ)  converts  any  normalized  impedance  into  the  corresponding 
normalized  admittance.    This  is  easily  proved:  since  Γ =  (Zn  -  1)/(Zn  +  1),  conversion  of  Zn  → 
n  + 1) =  (1  - Zn)/(Zn + 1) =  - Γ [Q.E.D.]35  Pairs of points with  this 
Z -1
n  yields Γ' =  (Z -1
n   - 1)/(Z -1
property include Zn = ±j and Zn = (0,∞). 

Another  useful  property  of  the  Smith  chart  is  that  the  voltage-standing-wave  ratio  (VSWR) 
equals the maximum positive real value Rn max of Zn lying on the circular locus occupied by Γ(z). 
This is easily shown from the definition of VSWR:

A more  important  use  of  the  Smith  chart  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.3.3, where  the  load  60  + 
j80 is to be matched to a 100-ohm TEM line so all the power is dissipated in the 60-ohm resistor. 
In  particular  the  length  (cid:65)  of  the  transmission  line  in  Figure  7.3.3(a)  is  to  be  chosen  so  as  to 
transform  ZL  =  60  +  80j  so  that  its  real  part  becomes  Zo.  The  new  imaginary  part  can  be 
cancelled by a reactive load (L or C) that will be placed either in position M or N.  The first step 
is  to  locate Zn  on  the  Smith  chart  at  the  intersection  of  the Rn  =  0.6  and Xn  =  0.8  circles, which 
happen  to  fall  at  Γ  =  0.5j.   Next we  locate  the  gamma  circle  Γ(z)  along which we  can move  by 
varying  (cid:65).  This  intersects  the  Rn  =  1  circle  at  point  “a”  after  rotating  toward  the  generator 
“distance A”.  Next we can add a negative reactance to cancel the reactance jXn = +1.18j at point 
“a” to yield Zn(a) = 1 and Z = Zo.  A negative reactance is a capacitor C in series at location M in 
the  circuit.    Therefore  1/jωC  =  -1.18jZo  and  C  =  (1.18ωZo)-1.  The  required  line  length  (cid:65) 
corresponds  to  ~0.05λ,  a  scale  for  which  is  printed  on  the  perimeter  of  official  charts  as 
illustrated in Figure 7.3.4.

More than three other matching schemes can be used here.  For example, we could lengthen 
(cid:65) to distance “B” and point “b”, where a positive reactance of Xn = 1.18 could be added in series 
at position M to provide a match.  This requires an inductor L = 1.18Zo/ω. 

Alternatively, we could note  that ZLn corresponds  to YLn = 0.6  - 0.8j on  the opposite side of 
the chart (Γ → -Γ), where the fact that both ZLn and YLn have the same real parts is a coincidence 
limited to cases where ΓL is pure imaginary.  Rotating toward the generator distance C again puts 
us on the Gn = 1 circle (Yn  ≡ Gn + jBn), so we can add a negative admittance Bn of -1.18j to yield 
Yo.  Adding  a  negative  admittance  in  parallel  at  z  =  -  (cid:65)  corresponds  to  adding  an  inductor  L  in 
position  N,  where  -jZoXn  =  1/jωL,  so  L  =  (1.18ωZ -1
o) .  By  rotating  further  to  point  “b”  a 
capacitor could be added  in parallel  instead of  the  inductor.   Generally one uses  the shortest  line 
length possible and the smallest, lowest-cost, lowest-loss reactive element.

Often printed circuits do not add capacitors or  inductors  to  tune devices, but simply print an 
extra  TEM  line  on  the  circuit  board  that  is  open-  or  short-circuit  at  its  far  end  and  is  cut  to  a 
length that yields the desired equivalent L or C at the given frequency ω.

One useful  approach  to matching  resistive  loads  is  to  insert a quarter-wavelength  section of 
TEM  line  of  impedance  ZA  between  the  load  ZL  and  the  feed  line  impedance  Zo.  Then  ZLn  = 
ZL/ZA  and  one  quarter-wave-length  down  the  TEM  line  where  Γ  becomes  -  Γ,  the  normalized 
impedance becomes  the  reciprocal, Z'n = ZA/ZL and  the  total  impedance  there  is Z' = Z 2
A /ZL.  If 
 
2
this  matches  the  output  transmission  line  impedance  Zo  so  that  Z
o  =  ZA /ZL  then  there  are  no 
reflections.  The  quarter-wavelength  section  is  called  a  quarter-wave  transformer  and  has  the 
impedance ZA =  (ZLZo)0.5.  A  similar  technique can be used  if  the  load  is partly  reactive without 
the  need  for L’s  or C’s,  but  the  length  and  impedance  of  the  transformer must  be  adjusted.    For 
example, any line impedance ZA will yield a normalized load impedance that can be rotated on a 
Smith  chart  to  become  a  real  impedance;  if  ZA  and  the  transformer  length  are  chosen  correctly, 
this  real  impedance  will  match  Zo.  Matching  usually  requires  iteration  with  a  Smith  chart  or  a 
numerical technique.

TEM resonances 

7.4.1 

Introduction 

Resonators  are  widely  used  for manipulating  signals  and  power,  although  unwanted  resonances 
can  sometimes  limit  system  performance.    For  example,  resonators  can  be  used  either  as  band-
pass  filters  that  remove  all  frequencies  from  a  signal  except  those  near  the  desired  resonant 
frequency  ωn,  or  as  band-stop  filters  that  remove  unwanted  frequencies  near  ωn  and  let  all 
frequencies pass.  They can also be used effectively as  step-up  transformers  to  increase voltages 
or  currents  to  levels  sufficient  to  couple  all  available  energy  into  desired  loads  without 
reflections.    That  is,  the  matching  circuits  discussed  in  Section  7.3.2  can  become  sufficiently 
reactive  for  badly mismatched  loads  that  they  act  like  band-pass  resonators  that  match  the  load 
only  for  a  narrow  band  of  frequencies.  Although  simple  RLC  resonators  have  but  one  natural 
resonance  and  complex  RLC  circuits  have  many,  distributed  electromagnetic  systems  can  have 
an infinite number. 

A  resonator  is  any  structure  that  can  trap  oscillatory  electromagnetic  energy  so  that  it 
escapes  slowly or not  at  all.  Section 7.4.2 discusses  energy  trapped  in TEM  lines  terminated  so 
that  outbound  waves  are  reflected  back  into  the  resonator,  and  Section  9.4  treats  cavity 
resonators formed by terminating rectangular waveguides with short circuits that similarly reflect 
and  trap  otherwise  escaping  waves.    In  each  of  these  cases  boundary  conditions  restricted  the 
allowed  wave  structure  inside  to  patterns  having  integral  numbers  of  half-  or  quarter-
wavelengths  along  any  axis  of  propagation,  and  thus  only  certain  discrete  resonant  frequencies 
ωn can be present. 

All  resonators  dissipate  energy  due  to  resistive  losses,  leakages,  and  radiation,  as  discussed 
in Section 7.4.3.  The rate at which this occurs depends on where the peak currents or voltages in 
the  resonator  are  located with  respect  to  the  resistive  or  radiating  elements.    For  example,  if  the 
resistive  element  is  in  series  at  a  current  null  or  in  parallel  at  a  voltage  null,  there  is  no 
dissipation.  Since  dissipation  is  proportional  to  resonator  energy  content  and  to  the  squares  of 
current or voltage,  the decay of field strength and stored energy  is generally exponential  in  time. 
Each  resonant  frequency  fn has  its own  rate of energy decay, characterized by  the dimensionless 

- 213 -


quality  factor Qn, which  is generally  the number of  radians ωnt  required  for  the  total energy wTn 
stored  in  mode  n  to  decay  by  a  factor  of  1/e.    More  importantly,  Q  ≅ fo/Δf,  where  fn  is  the 
resonant frequency and Δfn is the half-power full-width of resonance n. 

Section  7.4.4  then  discusses  how  resonators  can  be  coupled  to  circuits  for  use  as  filters  or 
transformers,  and  Section  7.4.5  discusses  how  arbitrary  waveforms  in  resonators  are  simply  a 
superposition of orthogonal modes, each decaying at its own rate. 

7.4.2  TEM resonator frequencies 

A resonator is any structure that traps electromagnetic radiation so it escapes slowly or not at all. 
Typical  TEM  resonators  are  terminated  at  their  ends  with  lossless  elements  such  as  short-  or 
open-circuits, inductors, or capacitors.  Complex notation is used because resonators are strongly 
frequency-dependent.  We  begin  with  the  expressions  (7.1.55)  and  (7.1.58)  for  voltage  and 
current on TEM lines:   

V( )z  =  V e − jkz  + V e + jkz

I( )z  = Y ⎡o ⎣V + e− jkz  − V −e+ jkz ⎤  [

(7.4.2) 

For example,  if both ends of a TEM  line of  length D are open-circuited,  then  I(z) = 0 at z = 
0 and z = D.  Evaluating (7.4.1) at z = 0 yields V- = V+.  At the other boundary:36

To satisfy (7.4.3), sin(2πD/λ) = 0, and so λ is restricted to specific resonances: 

λ = 2D n = c f
n 

n  for n = 0,1,2,3,... 

(7.4.4)

That  is,  at  resonance  the  length  of  this  open-circuited  line  is  D  =  nλn/2,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
7.4.1(a) for n = 1.  The corresponding resonant frequencies are:

(7.4.5)

By our definition, static storage of electric or magnetic energy corresponds to a resonance at zero 
frequency.  For example, in this case the line can hold a static charge and store electric energy at 
zero  frequency  (n = 0) because  it  is open-circuited at both ends.   Because  the different modes of 
a  resonator  are  spatially  orthogonal,  the  total  energy  stored  in  a  resonator  is  the  sum  of  the 
energies stored in each of the resonances separately, as shown later in (7.4.20). 

36 We use the identity sinφ = (ejφ - e-jφ)/2j.

Figure  7.4.1(b)  illustrates  one  possible  distribution  of  voltage  and  current  on  a  TEM

For  n  =  0  the  zero-frequency  solution  for  Figure  7.4.1(a)  corresponds  to  the  line  being 
charged  to  a  DC  voltage  Vo  with  zero  current.   The  electric  energy  stored  on  the  line  is  then 
DCV 2
o /2 [J], where the electric energy density on a TEM line (7.1.32) is:

(7.4.11) 

The extra factor of 1/2  in  the right-hand  term of (7.4.11) results because  cos 2 ω =t
0.5  for non-
 
zero  frequencies.  A  transmission  line  short-circuited  at  both  ends  also  has  a  zero-frequency 
resonance  corresponding  to  a  steady  current  flowing  around  the  line  through  the  two  short 
circuits  at  the  ends,  and  the  voltage  across  the  line  is  zero  everywhere.37   The  circuit  of  Figure 
7.4.1(b)  cannot  store  energy  at  zero  frequency,  however,  and  therefore  has  no  zero-frequency 
resonance. 

There  is  also  a  simple  relation  between  the  electric  and  magnetic  energy  storage  in 
resonators because Zo = (L/C)0.5 (7.1.31).  Using (7.4.11), (7.4.6), and (7.4.8) for n > 0:

(7.4.15) 

Integrating  these  two  time-average  energy  densities  We   and  Wm   over  the  length  of  a  TEM 
resonator  yields  the  important  result  that  at  any  resonance  the  total  time-average  stored  electric 
and  magnetic  energies  we  and  wm  are  equal;  the  fact  that  the  lengths  of  all  open-  and/or  short-
circuited  TEM  resonators  are  integral  multiples  of  a  quarter  wavelength  λn  is  essential  to  this 
result.  Energy  conservation  also  requires  this  because  periodically  the  current  or  voltage  is 
everywhere  zero  together  with  the  corresponding  energy;  the  energy  thus  oscillates  between 
magnetic and electric forms at twice fn. 

All resonators, not just TEM, exhibit equality between their time-average stored electric and 
magnetic  energies.    This  can  be  proven  by  integrating  Poynting’s  theorem  (2.7.24)  over  the 
volume of any resonator for the case where the surface integral of  S • nˆ  and the power dissipated 
Pd are zero:38

(7.4.17)

37 Some workers prefer not to consider the zero-frequency case as a resonance; by our definition it is. 
38 We assume here that μ and ε are real quantities so W is real too. 

- 216 -


This proof also applies, for example, to TEM resonators terminated by capacitors or inductors, in 
which case the reactive energy in the termination must be balanced by the line, which then is not 
an integral number of quarter wavelengths long. 

Any  system  with  spatially  distributed  energy  storage  exhibits  multiple  resonances.    These 
resonance  modes  are  generally  orthogonal  so  the  total  stored  energy  is  the  sum  of  the  separate 
energies for each mode, as shown below for TEM lines. 

Consider first the open-ended TEM resonator of Figure 7.4.1(a), for which the voltage of the 
nth mode, following (7.4.7), might be:

Since  the  time  average  electric  and  magnetic  energies  in  any  resonant  mode  are  equal,  the 
total  energy  is  twice  the  value  given  in  (7.4.21).    Thus  the  total  energy  wT  stored  on  this  TEM 
line  is  the  sum  of  the  energies  stored  in  each  resonant  mode  separately  because  all  m≠n  cross 
terms  in  (7.4.20)  integrate  to  zero.    Superposition  of  energy  applies  here  because  all  TEMm 
resonant  modes  are  spatially  orthogonal.    The  same  is  true  for  any  TEM  resonator  terminated 
with  short  or  open  circuits.    Although  spatial  orthogonality  may  not  apply  to  the  resonator  of 
Figure  7.4.2(a),  which  is  terminated  with  a  lumped  reactance,  the  modes  are  still  orthogonal 
because  they  have  different  frequencies,  and  integrating  vm(t)vn(t)  over  time  also  yields  zero  if 
m≠n.

Other types of resonator also generally have orthogonal resonant modes, so that in general:

(7.4.22) 

If  a  TEM  resonator  is  terminated  with  a  reactive  impedance  such  as  jωL  or  1/jωC,  then 
energy is still trapped but the resonant frequencies are non-uniformly distributed.  Figure 7.4.2(a) 
illustrates a  lossless  short-circuited TEM  line of  length D  that  is  terminated with  an  inductor Lo. 
Boundary  conditions  immediately  yield  an  expression  for  the  resonant  frequencies  ωn.  The 
impedance of the inductor is jωLo and that of the TEM line follows from (7.3.6) for ZL = 0: 

( ) = Z  (Z  − jZ  tankz ) (

(7.4.23)

Since  the  current  I  and  voltage  V  at  the  inductor  junction  are  the  same  for  both  the 
transmission line and the inductor, their ratios must also be the same except that we define I to be 
flowing out of the inductor into the TEM line, which changes the sign of +jωLo; so:

The  values  of  ωn  that  satisfy  (7.4.25)  are  represented  graphically  in  Figure  7.4.2(b),  and  are 
spaced non-uniformly in frequency.  The resonant frequency ωo = 0 corresponds to direct current 
and pure magnetic energy storage.  Figure 7.4.2(b) yields ωn for a line shorted at both ends when 
Lo = 0, and  shows  that  for  small values of Lo  (perturbations)  that  the shift  in  resonances Δωn are 
linear in Lo. 

We generally  can  tune  resonances  to nearby  frequencies by  changing  the  resonator  slightly. 
Section  9.4.2  derives  the  following  expression  (7.4.26)  for  the  fractional  change  Δf/f  in  any 
resonance  f  as  a  function  of  the  incremental  increases  in  average  electric  (Δωe)  and  magnetic

subtracted from the structure, where We and Wm are the electric and magnetic energy densities in

energy  densities  can  be  computed  using  the  unperturbed  values  of  field  strength  to  obtain 
approximate answers.

A simple example  illustrates  its use.   Consider  the TEM  resonator of Figure 7.4.2(a), which 
is approximately short-circuited at the left end except for a small tuning inductance Lo having an 
impedance  |jωL|  << Zo.  How  does Lo  affect  the  resonant  frequency  f1?  One  approach  is  to  use 
(7.4.25)  or  Figure  7.4.2(b)  to  find  wn.  Alternatively,  we  may  use  (7.4.26)  to  find  Δf  =  -  f1  ×

7.4.3  Resonator losses and Q 

All  resonators  dissipate  energy  due  to  resistive  losses,  leakage,  and  radiation.    Since  dissipation 
is proportional  to  resonator energy content and  to  the  squares of current or voltage,  the decay of 
field strength and stored energy is generally exponential in time.  Each resonant frequency fn has 
its  own  rate  of  energy  decay,  characterized  by  the  dimensionless  quality  factor  Qn,  which  is 
generally  the  number  of  radians ωnt  required  for  the  total  energy wTn  stored  in mode  n  to  decay 
by a factor of 1/e: 

Tn  t  = w Tn 0 e−ωn t Q J n  [ ]
w ( )

Qn is easily related to Pn, the power dissipated by mode n: 

Pn  ≅ −dw

(7.4.29) 

Qn  ≅ ωn w Tn

 Pn 

(quality factor Q) 

(7.4.30) 

The  rate  of  decay  for  each  mode  depends  on  the  location  of  the  resistive  or  radiating  elements 
relative  to  the  peak  currents  or  voltages  for  that  mode.    For  example,  if  a  resistive  element 

- 219 -


experiences  a  voltage  or  current  null,  there  is  no  dissipation.    These  relations  apply  to  all 
resonators, for example, RLC resonators: (3.5.20–23). 

Whether a resonator is used as a band-pass or band-stop filter, it has a bandwidth Δω within 
which  more  than  half  the  peak  power  is  passed  or  stopped,  respectively.    This  half-power 
bandwidth Δω is simply related to Q by (3.5.36): 

Q n ≅ ω n Δω n

(7.4.31)
 

The concept and utility of Q and the use of resonators in circuits are developed further in Section 
7.4.4. 

Loss in TEM lines arises because the wires are resistive or because the medium between the 
wires  conducts  slightly.    In  addition,  lumped  resistances may  be  present,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
7.4.3(b) and  (d).  If  these  resistances do not significantly perturb  the  lossless voltage and current 
distributions, then the power dissipated and Q of each resonance ωn can be easily estimated using 
perturbation techniques.  The perturbation method simply involves computing power dissipation 
using  the  voltages  or  currents  appropriate  for  the  lossless  case  under  the  assumption  that  the 
fractional  change  induced  by  the  perturbing  element  is  small  (perturbations  of  zero-valued 
parameters  are  not  allowed).    The  examples  below  illustrate  that  perturbing  resistances  can  be 
either very large or very small.

Figure 7.4.3  TEM resonators perturbed by loss. 

Consider  first  the  illustrated  ω1  resonance  of  Figure  7.4.3(a)  as  perturbed  by  the  small

Thus  Q1  ≅ Zo/R1  and  is  high  when  R1  <<  Zo;  in  this  case  R1  is  truly  a  perturbation,  so  our 
solution is valid. 

A  more  interesting  case  involves  the  loss  introduced  by  R2  in  Figure  7.4.3(b)  when  R1  is 
zero.  Since  the  unperturbed  shunting  current  at  that  position  on  the  line  is  zero,  we  must  use 
instead  the unperturbed voltage v(z,t)  to estimate P1 for mode 1, where  that nominal  line voltage

(7.4.39)

Thus  Q1  is  high  and  R2  is  a  small  perturbation  if  D  >>  δ,  even  if  R2  <  Zo.  This  is  because  a 
leakage  path  in  parallel with  a  nearby  short  circuit  can  be  a  perturbation  even  if  its  conductance 
is fairly high. 

In  the  same  fashion  Q  can  be  found  for  the  loss  perturbations  of  Figure  7.4.3(d).    For 
example, if R4 = 0, then [following (7.4.39)] the effect of R3 is:

(7.4.40)

In this case R3 is a perturbation if R3 >> Zo.  Most R4 values are also perturbations provided δ << 
D, similar  to  the situation for R2, because any resistance  in series with a nearby open circuit will 
dissipate little power because the currents there are so small.

7.4.4  Coupling to resonators 

Depending  on  how  resonators  are  coupled  to  circuits,  they  can  either  pass  or  stop  a  band  of 
frequencies  of  width  ~Δωn  centered  on  a  resonant  frequency  ωn.  This  effect  can  be  total  or 
partial; that is, there might be total rejection of signals either near resonance or far away, or only 
a  partial  enhancement  or  attenuation.    This  behavior  resembles  that  of  the  series  and  parallel 
RLC resonators discussed in Section 3.5.2. 

Figure  7.4.4  shows  how  both  series  and  parallel RLC  resonators  can  block  all  the  available 
power  to  the  load  resistor  RL  near  resonance,  and  similar  behavior  can  be  achieved  with  TEM 
resonators  as  suggested  below;  these  are  called  band-stop  filters.  Alternatively,  both  series  and 
parallel  RLC  resonators  can  pass  to  the  load  resistor  the  band  near  resonance,  as  suggested  in 
Figure 3.5.3;  these are called band-pass  filters.  In Figure 7.4.4(a)  the series LC  resonator  shorts 
out  the  load  R  near  resonance,  while  in  (b)  the  parallel  LC  resonator  open-circuits  the  load 
conductance G; the resonant band is stopped in both cases.

The half-power width Δω of each resonance is inversely proportional to the loaded Q, where 
QL was defined  in  (3.5.40), PDE  is  the power dissipated  externally  (in  the  source  resistance RTh), 
and PDI is the power dissipated internally (in the load R):

(7.4.42)

  When  ω  =  (LC)-0.5  the  LC  resonators  are  either  open-  or  short-circuit,  leaving  only  the 
source  and  load  resistors,  RTh  and  RL.  At  the  frequency  f  of  maximum  power  transfer  the 
fraction  of  the  available  power  that  can  be  passed  to  the  load  is  determined  by  the  ratio  Zn'  = 
RL/RTh.  For example, if the power source were a TEM transmission line of impedance Zo  ≡ RTh, 
then the minimum fraction of incident power reflected from the load (7.2.22) would be: 

(Zn '+ 1) 2 
2Γ = (Z '− 1  )
n 

(7.4.43)

The  fraction  reflected  is  zero  only when  the  normalized  load  resistance  Zn'  =  1,  i.e., when  RL  = 
RTh.  Whether  the  maximum  transfer  of  power  to  the  load  occurs  at  resonance  ωn  (band-pass 
filter)  or  only  at  frequencies  removed  more  than  ~Δω  from  ωn  (band-stop  filter)  depends  on 
whether  the current  is blocked or passed at ωn by  the LC portion of  the  resonator.   For example, 
Figures  3.5.3  and  7.4.4  illustrate  two  forms  of  band-pass  and  band-stop  filter  circuits, 
respectively. 

Resonators  can  be  constructed  using  TEM  lines  simply  by  terminating  them  at  both  ends 
with  impedances  that  reflect  most  or  all  incident  power  so  that  energy  remains  largely  trapped 
inside,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  7.4.5(a).    Because  the  load  resistance  RL  is  positioned  close  to  a 
short circuit (δ << λ/4), the voltage across RL is very small and little power escapes, even if RL  ≅ 
Zo.  The Q  for  the ω1  resonance  is easily calculated by using  (7.4.40) and  the expression  for  line 
voltage (7.4.36):

Figure 7.4.5  Coupled TEM resonator. 
 

We may  connect  this  resonator  externally  by  adding  a  feed  line  at  a  short  distance  δ2  from 
its  left  end,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  7.4.5(b).    If  the  feed  line  is  matched  at  its  left  end  then  the 
external Q,  QE,  associated with  power  dissipated  there  is  given  by  (7.4.45)  for  δ  =  δ2  and  RL  = 
Zo.  By adjusting δ2 any QE can be obtained.  Figures 3.5.3 and 7.4.4 suggest how the equivalent 
circuits  for  either  band-pass  or  band-stop  filters  can match  all  the  available  power  to  the  load  if 
RTh  =  RL  and  therefore QE  = QI.  Thus  all  the  available  power  can  be  delivered  to  RL  in  Figure 
7.4.5(b)  for  any  small  δ1  by  selecting  δ2  properly;  if  δ2  yields  a  perfect match  at  resonance,  we 
have  a  critically  coupled  resonator.  If  δ2  is  larger  than  the  critically  coupled  value,  then  the 
input transmission line is too strongly coupled, QE < QI, and we have an over-coupled resonator; 
conversely,  smaller values of  δ2 yield QE > QI  and undercoupling.  The bandwidth of  this band-
pass filter Δω is related to the loaded Q, QL, as defined in (7.4.41) where: 

I  + Q −1 
L  = Q −1 
Q −1 
E  = Δω ω 

 

 

(7.4.46) 

If the band-pass filter of Figure 7.4.5(b) is matched at resonance so QE = QI, it therefore has 
a  bandwidth  Δω  =  2ω/QI,  where  QI  is  given  by  (7.4.39)  and  is  determined  by  our  choice  of  δ1. 
Smaller values of δ1 yield higher values for QL and narrower bandwidths Δω.  In the special case 
where  RL  corresponds  to  another  matched  transmission  line  with  impedance  Zo,  then  a  perfect 
match at resonance results here when δ1 = δ2. 

Many  variations  of  the  coupling  scheme  in  Figure  7.4.5  exist.    For  example,  the  feed  line 
and  resonator can be  isolated by a  shunt consisting of a  large capacitor or  a  small  inductor, both 
approximating  short  circuits  relative  to  Zo,  or  by  a  high-impedance  block  consisting  of  a  small 
capacitor  or  large  inductor  in  series.    Alternatively,  an  external  feed  line  can  be  connected  in 
place  of R4  in Figure  7.4.3(d).    In  each weakly  coupled  case  perturbation methods  quickly  yield 
QI and QE, and therefore QL, Δω, and the impedance at resonance. 

The  impedance  at  resonance  can  be  found  once  QE,  QI,  and  Zo  for  the  feedline  are  known, 
and  once  it  is  known  whether  the  resonance  is  a  series  or  parallel  resonance.    Referring  to 
Figures 3.5.3 and 7.4.4 for equivalent circuits for band-pass and band-stop filters, respectively, it 
is  clear  that  if  QE  =  QI,  then  band-pass  resonators  are  matched  at  resonance  while  band-stop 
series-resonance  resonators are short circuits and parallel-resonance resonators are open circuits. 
Away from resonance band-pass resonators become open circuits for series resonances and short 
circuits for parallel resonances, while both types of band-stop resonator become matched loads if 
QE  =  QI.  At  resonance  all  four  types  of  resonator  have  purely  real  impedances  and  reflection 
coefficients Γ that can readily be found by examining the four equivalent circuits cited above.

Sometimes unintended resonances can disrupt systems.   For example, consider a waveguide 
that can propagate  two modes, only one of which  is desired.   If a  little bit of  the unwanted mode 
is  excited  at  one  end  of  the  waveguide,  but  cannot  escape  through  the  lines  connected  at  each 
end,  then  the second mode  is  largely  trapped and behaves as a weakly coupled resonator with its 
own  losses.    At  each  of  its  resonances  it  will  dissipate  energy  extracted  from  the  main 
waveguide.  If  the  internal  losses  happen  to  cause  QE  =  QI  for  these  parasitic  resonances,  no 
matter  how  weakly  coupled  they  are,  they  can  appear  as  a  matched  load  positioned  across  the 
main  line;  dissipation  by  parasitic  resonances  declines  as  their  internal  and  external  Q’s 
increasingly differ. 

The ability of a weakly coupled  resonance  to have a powerful external effect arises because 
the  field  strengths  inside  a  low-loss  resonator  can  rise  to  values  far  exceeding  those  in  the 
external circuit.   For example,  the critically coupled resonator of Figure 7.4.5(b) for RL = Zo and 
δ1  =  δ2,  has  internal  voltages  v(z,t)  = Vosinωt  sin(πz/D)  given  by  (7.4.44), where  the maximum 
terminal  voltage  is  only  Vosin(πδ/D)  ≅  Voπδ/D  <<  Vo.  Thus  a  parasitic  resonance  can  slowly 
absorb energy  from  its surroundings at  its  resonant  frequency until  its  internal  fields build  to  the 
point  that  even  with  weak  coupling  it  has  a  powerful  effect  on  the  external  fields  and  thus 
reaches an equilibrium value.  It is these potentially extremely strong resonant fields that enables 
critically  coupled  resonators  to  couple  energy  into  poorly  matched  loads--the  fields  in  the 
resonator  build  until  the  power  dissipated  in  the  load  equals  the  available  power  provided.    In 
some  cases  the  fields  can  build  to  the  point  where  the  resonator  arcs  internally,  as  can  happen 
with an empty microwave oven without an extra internal load to prevent it. 

This  analysis  of  the  resonant  behavior  of  TEM  lines  is  approximate  because  the  resonator 
length measured  in wavelengths  is  a  function  of  frequency within  Δω,  so  exact  answers  require 
use  the  TEM  analysis  methods  of  Sections  7.2–3,  particularly  when  Δω  becomes  a  non-trivial 
fraction of the frequency difference between adjacent resonances. 

Example 7.4B 
Consider  a  variation  of  the  coupled  resonator  of  Figure  7.4.5(b)  where  the  resonator  is  open-
circuited at both ends and the weakly coupled external connections at δ1 and δ2 from the ends are 
in  series with  the  100-ohm TEM  resonator  line  rather  than  in  parallel.    Find  δ1  and  δ2  for: QL = 
100, Zo = 100 ohms for both  the feed  line and resonator, RL = 50 ohms, and  the resonator  length 
is D ≅ λ/2, where λ is the wavelength within the resonator. 

Solution:	 For  critical  coupling, QE  = QI,  so  the  resonator  power  lost  to  the  input  line,  |I2|2Zo/2, 
|I1|2RL/2,  and 
must  equal 
that 
lost 
to 
the 
load, 
therefore 
|I1|/|I2|  = 
(Zo/RL)0.5 = 20.5.  Since  the λ/2  resonance of an open-circuited TEM  line has  I(z) ≅  Io 
sin(πz/D)  ≅ πz/D  for  δ  << D/π  (high Q),  therefore  |I1|/|I2|  =  [sin(πδ1/D)]/[sin(πδ2/D)] 
≅ δ1/δ2  ≅  20.5.  Also, QL  =  100  =  0.5×QI  =  0.5ωowT/PDI, where: ωo  =  2πfo  =  2πc/λ  = 
D(L|I|2/4)dz  ≅  LIo
2D/4;  and  PDI  = 
|I(δ1)|2RL/2  = 
πc/D;  wT  =  2wm  =  2∫0
2sin2(πδ1/D)RL/2  ≅  (Ioπδ1/D)2RL/2. 
 
Therefore  QI  =  ωowT/PDI  =  200  = 
Io
2D/4)/[(Ioπδ1/D)2RL/2] = (D/δ1)2(Zo/RL)/π, where cL = Zo = 100.  Thus δ1 = 
(πc/D)(LIo
π-0.5D/10 and δ2 = δ12-0.5 = (2π)-0.5D/10.

7.4.5  Transients in TEM resonators 

TEM  and  cavity  resonators  have  many  resonant  modes,  all  of  which  can  be  energized 
simultaneously,  depending  on  initial  conditions.    Because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  the 
total fields can be characterized as  the  linear superposition of  fields associated with each excited 
mode.  This  section  illustrates  how  the  relative  excitation  of  each  TEM  resonator  mode  can  be 
determined  from any given set of  initial conditions, e.g.  from v(z,  t = 0) and  i(z,  t = 0), and how 
the  voltage  and  current  subsequently  evolve.    The  same  general  method  applies  to  modal 
excitation  of  cavity  resonators.  By  using  a  similar  orthogonality  method  to  match  boundary 
conditions in space rather than in time, the modal excitation of waveguides and optical fibers can 
be found, as discussed in Section 9.3.3. 

The central concept developed below is that any initial condition in a TEM resonator at time 
zero can be replicated by superimposing some weighted set of voltage and current modes.   Once 
the phase and magnitudes of those modes are known, the voltage and current are then known for 
all  time.    The  key  solution  step  uses  the  fact  that  the mathematical  functions  characterizing  any 
two  different  modes  a  and  b,  e.g.  the  voltage  distributions  Va(z)  and  Vb(z),  are  spatially 
othogonal:  ∫ V ( )z V  
( ) 
b * z  dz  = 0 .

Consider  the  open-circuited  TEM  resonator  of  Figure  7.4.3(c),  for which Vn- = Vn+  for  any 
mode n because the reflection coefficient at the open circuit at z = 0 is +1.  The resulting voltage 
and current on the resonator for mode n are:39

where  kn  =  ωn/c  and  (7.4.5)  yields  ωn  =  nπc/D.  We  can  restrict  the  general  expressions  for

We note  that  these  two equations permit us  to solve for both  the real and  imaginary parts of 
Vn+,  and  therefore  for  v(z,t)  and  i(z,t).    Using  spatial  orthogonality  of  modes,  we  multiply  both 
sides of (7.4.49) by cos(mπz/D) and integrate over the TEM line length D, where kn = nπz/D:

In  general,  each  resonator  mode  decays  exponentially  at  its  own  natural  rate,  until  only  the 
longest-lived mode remains. 

As discussed in Section 9.3.3, the relative excitation of waveguide modes by currents can be 
determined in a similar fashion by expressing the fields in a waveguide as the sum of modes, and 
then  matching  the  boundary  conditions  imposed  by  the  given  excitation  currents  at  the  spatial 
origin  (not  time  origin).    The  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the  amplitudes  characterizing  each 
waveguide propagation mode can  then be determined by multiplying both sides of  this boundary 
equation by spatial sines or cosines corresponding to the various modes, and integrating over the 
surface defining the boundary at z = 0.  Arbitrary spatial excitation currents generally excite both 
propagating and evanescent modes  in  some  combination.   Far  from  the  excitation point only  the

propagating  modes  are  evident,  while  the  evanescent  modes  are  evident  principally  as  a 
reactance seen by the current source.
