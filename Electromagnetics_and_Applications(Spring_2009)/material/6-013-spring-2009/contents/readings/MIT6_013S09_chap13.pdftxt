13.1  Acoustic waves 

13.1.1  Introduction 

Wave phenomena are ubiquitous, so the wave concepts presented in this text are widely relevant. 
Acoustic waves  offer  an  excellent  example  because of  their  similarity  to  electromagnetic waves 
and because of their important applications.  Beside the obvious role of acoustics in microphones 
and loudspeakers, surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) devices are used as radio-frequency (RF) filters, 
acoustic-wave  modulators  diffract  optical  beams  for  real-time  spectral  analysis  of  RF  signals, 
and  mechanical  crystal  oscillators  currently  control  the  timing  of  most  computers  and  clocks. 
Because  of  the  great  similarity  between  acoustic  and  electromagnetic  phenomena,  this  chapter 
also reviews much of electromagnetics from a different perspective. 

Section 13.1.2 begins with a simplified derivation of the two main differential equations that 
characterize  linear  acoustics. This  pair  of  equations  can  be  combined  to  yield  the  acoustic wave 
equation.  Only longitudinal acoustic waves are considered here, not transverse or “shear” waves.  
These  equations  quickly  yield  the  group  and  phase  velocities  of  sound  waves,  the  acoustic 
impedance  of  media,  and  an  acoustic  Poynting  theorem.    Section  13.2.1  then  develops  the 
acoustic  boundary  conditions  and  the  behavior  of  acoustic  waves  at  planar  interfaces,  including 
an  acoustic  Snell’s  law,  Brewster’s  angle,  the  critical  angle,  and  evanescent  waves.    Section 
13.2.2  shows  how  acoustic  plane waves  can  travel within  pipes  and  be  guided  and manipulated 
much as plane waves can be manipulated within TEM transmission lines. 

Acoustic waves can be  totally reflected at firm boundaries, and Section 13.2.3 explains how 
they  can  be  trapped  and  guided  in  a  variety  of  propagation  modes  closely  resembling  those  in 
electromagnetic  waveguides,  where  they  exhibit  cutoff  frequencies  of  propagation  and 
evanescence  below  cutoff.    Section  13.2.4  then  explains  how  these  guides  can  be  terminated  at 
their ends with open or closed orifices, thus forming resonators with Q’s that can be controlled as 
in  electromagnetic  resonators  so  as  to  yield  band-stop  or  band-pass  filters.    The  frequencies  of 
acoustic resonances can be perturbed by distorting the shape of the cavity, as governed by nearly 
the  same  equation  used  for  electromagnetic  resonators  except  that  the  electromagnetic  energy 
densities  are  replaced  by  acoustic  energy  density  expressions.    Section  13.3  discusses  acoustic 
radiation  and  antennas,  including  antenna  arrays,  and  Section  13.4  concludes  the  chapter with  a 
brief introduction to representative electroacoustic devices. 

13.1.2  Acoustic waves and power 

Most  waves  other  than  electromagnetic  waves  involve  perturbations.    For  example,  acoustic 
waves  involve  perturbations  in  the  pressure  and  velocity  fields  in  gases,  liquids,  or  solids.    In 
gases  we  may  express  the  total  pressure  pT,  density  ρT,  and  velocity  u T   fields  as  the  sum  of  a 
static component and a dynamic perturbation:

(13.1.2)

(13.1.3) 

Another  complexity  is  that,  unlike  electromagnetic  variables  referenced  to  a  particular 
location,  gases  move  and  compress,  requiring  further  linearization.73      Most  important  is  the  
approximation that the mean velocity  Uo  = 0 .  After these simplifying steps we are left with two 
linearized acoustic equations, Newton’s law (f = ma) and conservation of mass:

ρ ∇
 

(Newton’s law) 

(13.1.4)

(conservation of mass) 

(13.1.5)

Newton’s  law states  that  the pressure gradient will  induce mass acceleration, while conservation 
of  mass  states  that  velocity  divergence  ∇ • u is  proportional  to  the  negative  time  derivative  of 
mass density. 

These  two  basic  equations  involve  three  key  variables:  p,  u ,  and  ρ;  we  need  the  acoustic 
constitutive relation to reduce this set to two variables.  Most acoustic waves involve frequencies 
sufficiently  high  that  the  heating  produced  by  wave  compression  has  no  time  to  escape  by 
conduction  or  radiation,  and  thus  this  heat  energy  returns  to  the  wave  during  the  subsequent 
expansion  without  significant  loss.    Such  adiabatic  processes  involve  no  heat  transfer  across 
populations  of  particles.  The  resulting  adiabatic  acoustic  constitutive  relation  states  that  the 
fractional  change  in  density  equals  the  fractional  change  in  pressure,  divided  by  a  constant  γ, 
called the adiabatic exponent: 

∂ρ ∂p = ρo γ Po 

(13.1.6)
 

The reason γ is not unity is that gas heats when compressed, which further increases the pressure, 
so  the  gas  thereby  appears  to  be  slightly  “stiffer”  or  more  resistant  to  compression  than 
otherwise.  This  effect  is  diminished  for  gas  particles  that  have  internal  rotational  or  vibrational 
degrees of  freedom so  the  temperature  rises  less upon compression.    Ideal monatomic molecules 
without such degrees of freedom exhibit γ = 5/3, and 1 < γ < 2, in general. 

Substituting  this constitutive  relation  into  the mass equation  (13.1.5)  replaces  the variable ρ 
with p, yielding the acoustic differential equations: 

t  ⎡⎣N/m

(13.1.8)

These  two  differential  equations  are  roughly  analogous  to  Maxwell’s  equations  (2.1.5)  and 
(2.1.6),  and  can  be  combined.    To  eliminate  u   from Newton’s  law we  operate  on  it with  (∇ •), 
and  then  substitute  (13.1.8)  for  ∇ • u   to  form  the  acoustic  wave  equation,  analogous  to  the 
Helmholtz wave equation (2.2.7):

(13.1.9)

Wave  equations  state  that  the  second  spatial  derivative  equals  the  second  time  derivative 
times  a  constant.    If  the  constant  is  not  frequency  dependent,  then  any  arbitrary  function  of  an 
argument  that  is  the  sum  or  difference  of  terms  linearly  proportional  to  time  and  space  will 
satisfy this equation; for example: 

p(

)r ,t  = ωp(
t − k • r) ⎡⎣ N/m  2 ⎤⎦ 

 
(13.1.10)

where p(•) is an arbitrary function of its argument (•), and  k = k x xˆ + k y yˆ + k z zˆ ; this is analogous
to  the  wave  solution  (9.2.4)  using  the  notation  (9.2.5).    Substituting  the  solution  (13.1.10)  into 
the wave equation yields:

This is analogous to the electromagnetic dispersion relation (9.2.8). 

As  in  the  case  of  electromagnetic  waves  [see  (9.5.19)  and  (9.5.20)],  the  acoustic  phase 
velocity vp and acoustic group velocity vg are simply related to k: 

)0.5  = cs

vg  = ∂( k ∂ω)−1  = ( γPo   ρo   )0.5

(acoustic group velocity)  (13.1.15) 

Adiabatic  acoustic  waves  propagating  in  0oC  air  near  sea  level  experience  γ =  1.4,  ρo  = 
1.29 [kg/m3], and Po = 1.01×105 [N/m2], yielding cs  ≅ 330 [m/s]. 

In solids or liquids the constitutive relation is: 

- 401 -


∂ρ ∂p  = ρ K 

(constitutive relation for solids and liquids)  (13.1.16) 

K  [N  m-2]  is  the  bulk  modulus  of  the  medium.    The  coefficient  1/K  then  replaces  1/γPo  in 
(13.1.8–10), yielding the acoustic velocity in solids and liquids: 

c  = (K 
s 

ρo )0.5  ⎡⎣m s −1⎤⎦ 

(acoustic velocity in solids and liquids)  (13.1.17)

Typical  acoustic  velocities  are  900  -  2000  m  s-1  in  liquids  (~1500  m  s-1  in  water),  and  1500– 
13,000 m s-1 in solids (~5900 m s-1 in steel). 

Analogous  to  (7.1.25)  and  (7.1.26),  the  acoustic  differential  equations  (13.1.8)  and  (13.1.7) 
can be simplified for sinusoidal plane waves propagating along the z axis:

(13.1.22) 

Note  that,  unlike  electromagnetic  waves,  where  the  key  fields  are  vectors  transverse  to  the 
direction of propagation, the velocity vector for acoustic waves is in the direction of propagation 
and pressure is a scalar.

13.2  Acoustic waves at interfaces and in guiding structures and resonators 

13.2.1  Boundary conditions and waves at interfaces 

The behavior of acoustic waves at boundaries is determined by the acoustic boundary conditions. 
At rigid walls the normal component of acoustic velocity must clearly be zero, and fluid pressure 
is  unconstrained  there.  At  boundaries  between  two  fluids  or  gases  in  equilibrium,  both  the 
)r ,t   and  the  normal  component  of  acoustic  velocity  u r⊥ (
),t   must  be 
acoustic  pressure  p(
continuous.  If the pressure were discontinuous, then a finite force normal  to  the  interface would 
be acting on infinitesimal mass, giving it infinite acceleration, which is not possible.  If  u ⊥  were 
discontinuous,  then  ∂p/∂t  at  the  interface  would  be  infinite,  which  also  is  not  possible;  (13.1.8) 
u  −(  γ  o )∂p  ∂t .  These acoustic boundary  conditions  at  a boundary between media 1 
says 
∇ •  = 1
 P
 
and 2 can be stated as: 

p1  = p2 

u1⊥ = u 2⊥

(13.2.2) 

A uniform acoustic plane wave  incident upon a planar boundary between  two media having 
different  acoustic  properties  will  generally  have  a  transmitted  component  and  a  reflected 
component, as  suggested  in Figure 13.2.1.   The angles of  incidence,  reflection, and  transmission 
are θi, θr, and θt, respectively.

A  typical  example  is  the  boundary  between  cold  air  overlying  a  lake  and  warm  air  above;  the 
warm air  is  less dense, although  the pressures across  the boundary must balance.   Since  cs  ∝ ρ ­
o
0.5  and  ηs  ∝ ρ 0.5
,  both  the  amplitudes  and  angles  of  propagation  must  change  at  the  density

discontinuity. 

As  was  done  for  electromagnetic  waves  (see  Section  9.2.2),  we  can  begin  with  tentative 
general expressions for the incident, reflected, and transmitted plane waves:

r  = p e+ jkix x − jk iz z

(13.2.5)

At  x  =  0  the  pressure  is  continuous  across  the  boundary  (13.2.1),  so  p (r ) + p  (r) = p  (

requires the phases (-jkz) to match:

k iz  = k rz  = k tz  ≡ k z 

But kz is the projection of the  k  on the z axis, so kiz = kisin θi, where ki = ω/csi, and:

(13.2.9)

Thus acoustic waves refract at boundaries like electromagnetic waves (9.2.26). 

Acoustic waves can also be evanescent for θi > θc, where the critical angle θc is the angle of 
incidence (9.2.30) required by Snell’s law when θt = 90°:

When  θi  >  θc,  then  ktx  becomes  imaginary,  analogous  to  (9.2.32),  the  transmitted  acoustic wave 
is evanescent, and there is total reflection of the incident acoustic wave.  Thus:

It follows from the complex version of (13.1.7) that:

(13.2.13) 

The complex power  flow  in  this acoustic evanescent wave  is  pu * , analogous  to  (9.2.35),  so  the 
power flowing in the -x direction is imaginary and the time-average real power flow is:

(13.2.14)

The  fraction  of  power  reflected  from  an  acoustic  boundary  can  be  found  by  applying  the 
boundary conditions and solving for the unknown reflected amplitude.  If we define  p ro   and  p to 
as  Γp io   and  Tp io  , respectively, then matching boundary conditions at x = z = 0 yields: 

pio  + p ro  = p to ⇒ 1 + Γ  = T 

(13.2.15) 

We  need  an  additional  boundary  condition,  and  may  combine  u = −∇p j
expression for  p  (13.2.3) to yield:

where we  define  the  normalized  angle-dependent  acoustic  impedance ηn  ≡ (ηtcosθi/ηicosθt)  and 
we recall kxt = ktcosθt, kt = ω/cst, and ηt = cst  ρot.  Combining (13.2.15) and (13.2.18) yields:

These  expressions  for  Γ and  T  are  essentially  the  same  as  for  electromagnetic  waves,  (7.2.31) 
and  (7.2.32),  although  the  expressions  for  ηn  are  different.  The  fraction  of  acoustic  power 
reflected  is  |Γ|2.  Acoustic  impedance  η(z)   for  waves  propagating  perpendicular  to  boundaries 
therefore also are governed by (7.2.24):

The Smith chart method of Section 7.3.2 can also be used. 

There  can  even  be  an  acoustic  Brewster’s  angle  θB  when  Γ =  0,  analogous  to  (9.2.75). 
Equation  (13.2.19)  suggests  this  happens  when  ηn  =  1  or,  from  (13.2.18),  when  ηicosθt  = 
ηtcosθB.  After some manipulation it can be shown that Brewster’s angle is:

door,  what  are  their  respective  acoustic  impedances,  ηa  and  ηd?    What  fraction  of  500-Hz

gaseous is irrelevant here if it is free to move and not secured to its door jamb. 

Solution:  	 The  acoustic  impedance  η =  ρocs  =  425.7  in  air  and  106  in  the  door  (13.1.23).  The 
impedance  at 
the 
front 
surface  of 
the  door  given  by 
(13.2.21) 
is 
ηfd  =  ηd(ηa  -  jηdtan  kz)/(ηd  -  jηatan  kz),  where  k  =  2π/λd  and  z  =  0.03.  λd  =  cd/f  = 
1000/500  =  2,  so  kz  =  πz  =  0.094,  and  tan  kz  =  0.095.  Thus ηfd  =  425.7  +  3.84  and 
2
ηfd/η
a  =  1.0090.  Using  (13.2.19) 
the  reflected  power  fraction  = 
|Γ|   = 
|(ηn  –  1)/(ηn  +  1)|2  where  ηn  =  ηfd/ηa  =  1.0090,  we  find  |Γ|2  ≅ 2×10-5.  Virtually  all 
acoustic  power  passes  through.  If  this  solid  door  were  secure  in  its  frame,  shear 
forces (neglected here) would lead to far better acoustic isolation. 

13.2.2  Acoustic plane-wave transmission lines 

Acoustic  plane  waves  guided  within  tubes  of  constant  cross-section  satisfy  the  boundary 
conditions posed by stiff walls: 1) u⊥ = 0, and 2) any u// and p  is permitted.    If  these  tubes curve 
slowly  relative  to  a  wavelength  then  their  plane-wave  behavior  is  preserved.    The  viscosity  of 
gases  is  sufficiently  low  that  frictional  losses  at  the  wall  can  usually  be  neglected  in  small 
acoustic  devices.    The  resulting  waves  are  governed  by  the  acoustic  wave  equation  (13.1.20), 
which has the solutions for p, uz, and η given by (13.1.21), (13.1.22), and (13.1.23), respectively.  
Wave  intensity  is  governed  by  (13.1.26),  the  complex  reflection  coefficient  Γ is  given  by 

- 407 -


(13.2.19),  and  impedance  transformations  are  governed  by  (13.2.21).    This  set  of  equations  is 
adequate  to  solve most  acoustic  transmission  line  problems  in  single  tubes  once we model  their 
terminations. 

Two  acoustic  terminations  for  tubes  are  easily  treated:  closed  ends  and  open  ends.    The 
boundary condition posed at  the closed end of an acoustic pipe  is simply  that u = 0.   At an open 
end the pressure is sufficiently released that p ≅ 0 there.  If we intuitively relate acoustic velocity 
u(t,z)  to  current  i(z,t)  in  a TEM  line,  and p(z,t)  to voltage v(t,z),  then  a  closed pipe  is  analogous 
to an open circuit, and an open pipe is analogous to a short circuit (the reverse of what we might 
expect).75    Standing  waves  exist  in  either  case,  with  λ/2  separations  between  pressure  nulls  or 
between velocity nulls. 

13.2.3  Acoustic waveguides 

Acoustic  waveguides  are  pipes  that  convey  sound  in  one  or  more  waveguide  modes.    Section 
13.2.2  considered  only  the  special  case  where  the  waves  were  uniform  and  the  acoustic 
velocity⎯u was confined to the ±z direction.  More generally the wave pressure and velocity must 
satisfy the acoustic wave equation, analogous to (2.3.21):

(13.2.23)

Solutions  to  (13.2.23)  in  cartesian  coordinates  are  appropriate  for  rectangular  waveguides, 
as discussed in Section 9.3.2.  Assume that two of the walls are at x = 0 and y = 0.  Then a wave 
propagating in the +z direction might have the general form: 

⎧sink x x ⎫⎧sink  y

p( x , z  ) = p 
y,
⎬e

(13.2.24)

The  choice  between  sine  and  cosine  is  dictated  by  boundary  conditions  on  u ,  which  can  be 
ωρo  (13.2.13).  Since  the  velocity  u   perpendicular  to  the  waveguide 
found  using  u = −∇p j
 
walls at x = 0 and y = 0 must be zero, so must be the gradient ∇p in the same perpendicular x and 
y  directions  at  the  walls.    Only  the  cosine  factors  in  (13.2.24)  have  this  property,  so  the  sine 
factors must be zero, yielding:

75  Although  methods  directly  analogous  to  TEM  transmission  lines  can  also  be  used  to  analyze  tubes  of  different 
cross-sections joined at junctions, the subtleties place this topic outside the scope of this text.

Since  u ⊥   (i.e.  u x   and  u y )  must  also  be  zero  at  the  walls  located  at  x  =  a  and  y  =  b,  it 
 
follows  that kxa = mπ, and kyb = nπ, where m and n are  integers: 0,1,2,3,...    Substitution of any 
 
of these solutions (13.2.25) into the wave equation (13.1.9) yields:

Therefore  each  acoustic  mode  Amn  has  its  own  cutoff  frequency  ωmn  where  kz  becomes

The total wave in any acoustic waveguide is that superposition of separate modes which matches 
the  given  boundary  conditions  and  sources,  where  one  (A00)  or  more  modes  always  propagate 
and an infinite number (m→∞, n→∞) are evanescent and reactive.  The expression for p follows 
from  (13.2.25)  where  e− jk

13.2.4  Acoustic resonators 

Any closed container trapping acoustic energy exhibits resonances  just as do low-loss containers 
of electromagnetic  radiation.   We may consider a rectangular room, or perhaps a smaller box, as 
a  rectangular  acoustic  waveguide  terminated  at  its  ends  by  walls  (velocity  nulls  for  uz).   The 
acoustic waves inside must obey (13.2.27):

where  kz  =  2π/λz  has  been  replaced  by  kz  =  qπ/d  using  the  constraint  that  if  the  box  is  short-  or 
open-circuited  at  both  ends  then  its  length  d  must  be  an  integral  number  q  of  half-wavelengths 
λz/2;  therefore  d  =  qλz/2  and  2π/λz  =  qπ/d.  Thus,  analogous  to  (9.4.3),  the  acoustic  resonant

Each  resonant  mode  Amnq  corresponds  to  one  set  of  quantum  numbers  m,n,q  and  to  one  cell  in 
the  figure.  Referring  to  (13.2.11)  it  can  be  seen  that  frequency  in  the  figure  corresponds  to  the 
length of a vector  from  the origin  to  the mode Amnq of  interest.   The  total number No of acoustic 
modes  with  resonances  at  frequencies  less  than  fo  is  approximately  the  volume  of  the  eighth-
sphere  shown 
in 
the  figure,  divided  by 
the  volume  of  each  cell  of  dimension 
(cs/2a) × (cs/2b) × (cs/2d), where each cell corresponds to one acoustic mode.  The approximation 
improves as f increases.  Thus:

Typical  examples  of  acoustic  resonators  include  musical  instruments  such  as  horns, 
woodwinds,  organ  pipes,  and  the  human  vocal  tract.    Rooms  with  reflective  walls  are  another 
example.  In each case if we wish to excite a particular mode efficiently the source must not only 
excite it with the desired frequency, but also from a favorable location. 

One  way  to  identify  favorable  locations  for  modal  excitation  is  to  assume  the  acoustic 
source  exerts  pressure  p  across  a  small  aperture  at  the wall  or  interior  of  the  resonator,  and  then 
to compute  the  incremental acoustic  intensity  transferred  from  that  source  to  the  resonator using 
(13.1.27): 

=  e{pu
I R   *

 2}

 

(13.2.37)

In  this  expression  we  assume⎯u  is  dominated  by  waves  already  present  in  the  resonator  at  the 
resonant  frequency  of  interest  and  that  the  vector⎯u  is  normal  to  the  surface  across  which  p  is 
applied.  Therefore  pressure  sources  located  at  velocity  nulls  for  a  particular  mode  transfer  no 
power  and no  excitation occurs.  Conversely, power  transfer  is maximized  if pressure  is  applied 
at velocity maxima.  Similarly, acoustic velocity sources are best located at a pressure maximum 
of  a  desired  mode.    For  example,  all  acoustic  modes  have  pressure  maxima  at  the  corners  of 
rectangular rooms, so velocity loudspeakers located there excite all modes equally. 

The converse  is also  true.  If we wish  to damp certain acoustic modes we may put absorber 
at  their velocity or pressure maxima, depending on  the  type of absorber used.   A wire mesh  that 
introduces  drag  damps  high  velocities,  and  surfaces  that  reflect  waves  weakly  (such  as  holes  in 
pipes)  damp  pressure  maxima.    High  frequency  modes  are  more  strongly  damped  in  humid 
atmospheres  than  are  low  frequency  modes,  but  such  bulk  absorption  mechanisms  do  not 
otherwise discriminate among them. 

Because the pressure and velocity maxima are located differently for each mode, each mode 
typically  has  a  different  Q,  which  is  the  number  of  radians  before  the  total  stored  energy  wT 
decays by a factor of e-1.  Therefore the Q of any particular mode m,n,p is (7.4.34): 

Q = ω w o T  Pd   

(acoustic Q)  (13.2.38)

The  resonant  frequencies  and  stored  energies  are  given  by  (13.2.33)  and  (13.1.25),  respectively, 
where  it  suffices  to  compute  either  the maximum stored  kinetic  or  potential  energy,  for  they  are 
equal.  The  power  dissipated  Pd  can  be  found  by  integrating  the  intensity  expression  (13.2.37) 
over the soft walls of the resonator, and adding any dissipation occurring in the interior. 

- 411 -


Small  changes  in  resonator  shape  can  perturb  acoustic  resonant  frequencies,  much  like 
electromagnetic  resonances  are  perturbed.    Whether  a  gentle  indentation  increases  or  lowers  a 
particular  resonant  frequency  depends  on  whether  the  time  average  acoustic  pressure  for  the 
mode  of  interest  is  positive  or  negative  at  that  indentation.    It  is  useful  to  note  that  acoustic 
energy is quantized, where each phonon has energy hf Joules where h is Planck’s constant; this is 
directly analogous  to a photon at  frequency  f.   Therefore  the  total acoustic energy  in a  resonator 
at frequency f is: 

w T  = nhf

[J] 
 

(13.2.39) 

If  the  cavity  shape  changes  slowly  relative  to  the  frequency,  the  number  n  of  acoustic 
phonons  remains  constant  and  any  change  in  wT  results  in  a  corresponding  change  in  f.  The 
work  ΔwT  done  on  the  phonon  field  when  cavity  walls  move  inward  Δz  is  positive  if  the  time 
average  acoustic  pressure  Pa  is  outward  (positive),  and  negative  if  that  pressure  is  inward  or 
negative:  ΔwT  =  PaΔz.  It  is  well  known  that  gaseous  flow  parallel  to  a  surface  pulls  on  that 
surface  as  a  result  of  the  Bernoulli  effect,  which  is  the  same  effect  that  explains  how  airplane 
wings  are  supported  in  flight  and  how  aspirators  work.    Therefore  if  an  acoustic  resonator  is 
gently  indented at a velocity maximum  for a particular  resonance,  that  resonant  frequency  f will 
be reduced slightly because  the phonon field pulling the wall inward will have done work on the 
wall.    All  acoustic  velocities  at  walls  must  be  parallel  to  them.    Conversely,  if  the  indentation 
occurs  near  pressure maxima  for  a  set  of modes,  the  net  acoustic  force  is  outward  and  therefore 
the  indentation  does  work  on  the  phonon  field,  increasing  the  energy  and  frequency  of  those 
modes. 

The most  pervasive  example  of  this  phenomenon  is  human  speech, which  employs  a  vocal 
tract  perhaps  16  cm  long,  typically  less  in women  and  all  children.   One  end  is  excited  by  brief 
pulses  in  air  pressure  produced  as  the  vocal  chords  vibrate  at  the  pitch  frequency  of  any  vowel 
being  uttered.    The  resulting  train  of  periodic  pressure  pulses  with  period  T  has  a  frequency 
spectrum consisting of  impulses spaced at T-1 Hz,  typically below 500 Hz.   The vocal  tract  then 
accentuates those impulses falling near any resonance of that tract.

Figure 13.2.3  illustrates  the  lowest  frequency acoustic  resonances possible  in pipes  that are: 
(a)  closed  at  both  ends,  (b)  open  at  both  ends,  and  (c)  closed  at  one  end  and  open  at  the  other; 
each  mode  is  designated  A001  for  its  own  structure,  where  00  corresponds  to  the  fact  that  the 
acoustic wave is uniform in the x-y plane, and 1 indicates that it is the lowest non-zero-frequency 
resonant mode.  Resonator (a) is capable of storing energy at zero frequency by pressurization (in 
the  A000  mode),  and  resonator  (b)  could  store  energy  in  the  A000  mode  if  there  were  a  steady 
velocity in one direction through the structure; these A000 modes are generally of no interest, and 
some experts do not consider them modes at all. 

A  sketch  of  the  human  vocal  tract  appears  in  Figure  13.2.4(a);  at  resonance  it  is  generally 
open  at  the mouth  and  closed  at  the  vocal  chords,  analogous  to  the  resonator  pictured  in  Figure 
13.2.3(c).  This  structure  resonates  when  its  length  D  corresponds  to  one-quarter  wavelength, 
three-quarters  wavelength,  or  generally  (2n-1)/4  wavelengths  for  the  A00n  mode,  as  sketched  in 
Figure 13.2.3(b).  For a vocal tract 16 cm long and a velocity of sound cs = 340 m s-1, the lowest 
resonant  frequency  f001 = cs/λ001 = 340/(4 × 0.16) = 531 Hz.  The next  resonances,  f2 and  f3,  fall 
at 1594 and 2656 Hz, respectively.

Figure 13.2.4  Human vocal tract. 
 

If  the  tongue  now  indents  the  vocal  tract  at  the  arrow  indicated  in  (a)  and  (b)  of  Figure 
13.2.4,  then  the  three  illustrated  resonances  will  all  shift  as  indicated  in  (c)  of  the  figure.    The 
resonance  f1  shifts  only  slightly  upward  because  the  indentation  occurs  between  the  peaks  for 
velocity  and  pressure,  but  nearer  to  the  pressure  peak.    The  resonances  shift  more  significantly 
down for f2 and up for f3 because this indentation occurs near velocity and pressure maximum for 
these  two  resonances,  respectively,  while  occurring  near  a  null  for  the  complimentary  variable. 
By simply controlling the width of the vocal tract at various positions using the tongue and teeth, 
these tract resonances can be modulated up and down to produce our full range of vowels. 

These  resonances  are  driven  by  periodic  impulses  of  air  released  by  the  vocal  cords  at  a 
pitch  controlled  by  the  speaker.    The  pitch  is  a  fraction  of  the  lowest  vocal  tract  resonant 
frequency,  and  the  impulses  are  sufficiently  brief  that  their  harmonics  range  up  to  5  kHz  and 

- 413 -


more.  Speech also  includes high-pitched broadband noise caused by  turbulent air whistling past 
the  teeth  or  other  obstacles  as  in  the  consonants  s,  h,  and  f,  and  impulsive  spikes  caused  by 
temporary tract closures, as in the consonants b, d, and p.  Speech therefore includes both voiced 
(driven  by  vocal  chord  impulses)  and  unvoiced  components.    The  spectral  content  of  most 
consonants can similarly be modulated by the vocal tract and mouth. 

It is possible to change the composition of the air in the vocal tract, thus altering the velocity 
of sound cs and the resonant frequencies of the tract, which are proportional to cs (13.2.30).  Thus 
when  breathing  helium  all  tract  resonance  frequencies  increase  by  a  noticeable  fraction, 
equivalent  to  shortening  the  vocal  tract.    Note  that  pitch  is  not  significantly  altered  by  helium 
because  the  natural  pitch  of  the  vocal  chords  is  determined  instead  primarily  by  their  tension, 
composition, and length.  

13.3  Acoustic radiation and antennas 

Any  mechanically  vibrating  surface  can  radiate  acoustic  waves.    As  in  the  case  of 
electromagnetic  waves,  it  is  easiest  to  understand  a  point  source  first,  and  then  to  superimpose 
such  radiators  in  combinations  that  yield  the  total  desired  radiation  pattern.   Reciprocity  applies 
to  linear  acoustics,  so  the  receiving  and  transmitting  properties  of  acoustic  antennas  are 
proportional, as they are for electromagnetic waves; i.e. G(θ,φ) ∝ A(θ,φ). 

The acoustic wave equation for pressure permits analysis of an acoustic monopole radiator: 

⎡ 2

⎣

c  s  ⎦p = 0 

(13.3.1) 

If  the acoustic radiator  is simply an  isolated sphere with a sinusoidally oscillating radius  a ,  then 
the  source  is  spherically  symmetric  and  so  is  the  solution;  thus  ∂/∂θ =  ∂/∂φ =  0.  If  we  define 
ω/cs = k, then (13.3.1) becomes:

acoustic  near  field,  respectively.   When  kr  >>  1  or,  equivalently,  r  >>  λ/2π,  then  the  near  field 
term can be neglected, so that the far-field velocity corresponding to (13.3.4) is:

(13.3.7) 

Since  k  =  ω/cs,  the  near-field  velocity  is  proportional  to  ω-1,  and  becomes  very  large  at  low 
frequencies.  Thus  a  velocity  microphone,  i.e.,  one  that  responds  to  acoustic  velocity  u  rather 
than to pressure, will respond much more strongly to low frequencies than to high ones when the 
microphone  is  held  close  to  one’s  lips  (r  <<λ/2π);  this  effect  is  usually  compensated 
electronically.  The  advantage  of  velocity  microphones  is  that  they  are  largely  deaf  to  ambient 
noise  originating  in  their  far  field  (r  >>  λ/2π),  although  they  are  sensitive  to  local  wind 
turbulence. 

The  acoustic  intensity  I(r)  can  be  computed  using  (13.1.22)  for  a  sphere  of  radius  a 
oscillating with a surface velocity uo at r = a.  In this case  u(a ) = r ˆu o , and substituting this value 
 
 
for  u  into (13.3.7) yields the constant  K =  ju oηsa 2 ; this near-field equation is appropriate only if 
a << λ/2π.  Thus, using (13.3.4) and (13.3.6), the far field intensity is:

where 2π/λ = ω/cs has been substituted.  Thus Pt  is proportional  to ηsω2a4(uo/cs)2.  This suggests 
the  importance  of  using  a  high  frequency  ω  and  large  radius  a  if  substantial  power  is  to  be 
radiated using a velocity source  uo . 

If we imagine a Thevenin equivalent acoustic source providing a “current” of uo, then, using 
(13.3.9), the acoustic radiation resistance of this acoustic antenna is:

Arrays  of  such  acoustic  sources  can  synthesis  a  wide  variety  of  antenna  patterns  because 
superposition  applies  and  thus  acoustic  pressure  and  velocities  will  tend  to  cancel  in  some 
directions and add  in others.  For example,  two such equal sources spaced distance d along  the z 
axis,  close  compared  to  a  wavelength  and  driven  out  of  phase,  would  radiate  the  far-field 
pressure:

The  radiated  intensity  I(θ)  for  this  acoustic  dipole  is  sketched  in  Figure  13.3.1(a),  and  is

Thus  it  radiates  poorly  at  low  frequencies.    Its  acoustic  antenna  gain G(θ)  is  3cos2θ, which  can 
be computed by comparing  the acoustic  intensity I  to  the  total acoustic power radiated Pt,  just as 
is done for electromagnetic antennas.  That is, the acoustic gain over an isotropic radiator is:

A  common way  to  produce  this  dipole  acoustic  pattern  is  illustrated  in  Figure  13.3.1(b)  for 
the  case  of  a  loudspeaker with  no  baffling  to  block  radiation  from  the  back  side  of  its  vibrating 
speaker  cone;  the  back  side  is  clearly  180o  out  of  phase with  the  velocity  of  the  front  side.   The 
radiation from an unbaffled loudspeaker can unfortunately reflect from the walls of the room and 
interfere with the sound from the front side, reinforcing those frequencies for which the two rays 
add  in  phase,  and  diminishing  those  frequencies  for  which  they  are  out  of  phase.    As  a  result, 
most good  loudspeakers  are baffled  so  the  reverse wave  is  trapped  and  cannot  interfere with  the 
primary wave radiated forward.  This alters the acoustic impedance of the loudspeaker, but it can 

- 416 -


be  electrically  compensated.    The  result  is  an  acoustic  monopole  that  radiates  total  power  in 
proportion to p2, k2, and therefore ω2, rather than ω4 as for the dipole. 

A  linear  array  of  monopole  acoustic  sources  of  total  length  L  has  a  diffraction  pattern 
similar  to  that  for  an  array  of Hertzian  dipoles.    If  the  sources  are  all  in  phase,  then  they  radiate 
maximum power broadside (θ ≡ 0) where all rays remain in phase.  They exhibit their first null at 
θ  ≅  ±λ/L.  See  Section  10.4  for  more  discussion  of  arrays  of  radiators.    Acoustic  array 
microphones  have  similar  directional  patterns,  and  microphones  feeding  parabolic  reflectors  of 
large dimension L have even higher gains, where  the gain of an acoustic antenna  is proportional 
to its effective area.  The effective area of a parabolic reflector large compared to a wavelength is 
approximately its physical cross-section if it is uniformly illuminated without spillover, as shown 
in (11.1.25) for electromagnetic waves. 

13.4  Electrodynamic-acoustic devices 

13.4.1  Magneto-acoustic devices 

One of the most common electro-acoustic devices is the loudspeaker, where larger units typically 
employ  a magnetic  solenoid  (see Section  6.4.1)  to  drive  a  large  lightweight  cone  that  pushes  air 
with  the  driven  waveform.    The  frequency  limits  are  within  the  mechanical  resonances  of  the 
system,  which  are  the  natural  frequencies  of  oscillation  of  the  cone.    The  low  frequency 
mechanical  limit  is  typically  set by  the  resonance  of  the  rigid  cone  oscillating within  its  support 
structure.  An  upper  mechanical  limit  is  set  by  the  natural  resonance  modes  of  the  cone  itself, 
which are  lower for  larger cones because  the driven waves  typically propagate outward  from  the 
driven  center,  and  can  reflect  from  the  outer  edge  of  the  cone,  setting  up  standing  waves.    The 
amplitude  limit  is  typically  set  by  the  strength  of  the  system  and  its  linearity.    As  shown  in 
Section 6.1.2, mechanical motion can generate electric voltages in the same systems, so they also 
function as microphones. 

Another  magneto-acoustic  device  uses  magnetostriction,  which  is  the  shrinkage  of  some 
magnetic materials when  exposed  to  large magnetic  fields.   They  are  used when  small  powerful 
linear motions are desired,  typically on  the order of microns.   To obtain  larger motions  the drive 
head  can  be  connected  to  a  mechanically  tapered  acoustic  transmission  line  resembling  a  small 
solid  version  of  a  trumpet  horn  that  smoothly  matches  the  high  mechanical  impedance  of  the 
driver over  a  large  area  to  the  low mechanical  impedance of  the  small  tip.   The  small  tip moves 
much  greater  distances  because  acoustic  power  is  conserved  if  the  taper  is  slow  compared  to  a 
quarter-wavelength,  much  like  a  series  of  quarter-wave  transformers  being  used  for  impedance 
transformation;  small  tips moving  large distances  convey  the  same power  as  large  areas moving 
small  distances.    Such  acoustic-transmission-line  transformers  can  be  used  in  either  direction, 
depending on whether high displacements or high forces are desired. 

13.4.2  Electro-acoustic devices 

The  simplest  electro-acoustic  device  is  perhaps  a  capacitor  with  one  plate  that  is  free  to  move 
and  push  air  in  response  to  time-varying  electric  forces  on  it,  as  discussed  in  Section  6.2.2.

These  can  be  implemented  macroscopically  or  within  micro-electromechanical  systems 
(MEMS). 

Some materials such as quartz are piezo-electric and shrink or distort when high voltages are 
place  across  them.   Because  this warping  yields  little  heat,  periodic  excitation  of  quartz  crystals 
can cause them to resonate with a very high Q, making them useful for time-keeping purposes in 
watches,  computers,  and  other  electronic  devices.    These  mechanical  resonances  for  common 
crystals  are  in  the  MHz  range  and  have  stabilities  that  are  ~10-4–10-6,  depending  mostly  on 
temperature stability; larger crystals resonate at lower frequencies.  They can also be designed to 
drive  tiny  resonant  loudspeakers  at  high  acoustic  frequencies  and  efficiencies  for  watch  alarms, 
etc. 

By  reciprocity,  good  piezo-electric  actuators  are  also  good  sensors  and  can  be  used  as 
microphones.  Mechanical distortion of such materials generates small measurable voltages.  The 
same  is  true  when  the  plate  separation  of  capacitors  is  varied,  as  shown  in  Section  6.6.1. 
Mechanically  tapered solid acoustic waveguides can also be used for  impedance  transformations 
between  low-force/high-motion  terminals  and  high-force/low  motion  terminals,  as  noted  in 
Section 13.4.1.  Levers can also be used for the same purpose. 

13.4.3  Opto-acoustic-wave transducers 

When  transparent  materials  are  compressed  their  permittivity  generally  increases,  slowing 
lightwaves  passing  through.  This  phenomenon  has  been  used  to  compute  Fourier  transforms  of 
broadband  signals  that  are  converted  to  acoustic  waves  propagating  down  the  length  of  a 
transparent  rectangular  rod.  A  uniform  plane  wave  from  a  laser  then  passes  through  the  rod  at 
right  angles  to  it  and  to  the  acoustic beam,  and  thereby  experiences  local phase  lags  along  those 
portions of  the rod where  the acoustic wave has  temporarily compressed  it.   If  the acoustic wave 
is  at  100 MHz  and  the  velocity  of  sound  in  the  bar  is  1000 m/s,  then  the  acoustic wavelength  is 
10 microns.    If  the  laser  has wavelength  1 micron,  then  the  laser  light will  pass  straight  through 
the  bar  and  will  also  diffract  at  angles  ±λ  laser/λacoustic  =  10-6/10-5  =  0.1  radian.  Several  other 
beams  will  emerge  too,  at  ~±0.2,  0.3,  etc.  [radians].  There  will  therefore  be  a  diffracted  laser 
beam at an angle unique  to each Fourier component of  the acoustic signal,  the strength of which 
depends on  the magnitude of  the associated optical phase delays along  the  rod.   Lenses can  then 
focus these various plane waves to make the power density spectrum more visible. 

If several exit ports are provided for the emerging light beams, one per angle, the laser beam 
can effectively be switched at acoustic speeds among those ports.  If 100 exit ports are provided, 
then the rod length L should be at least 100 wavelengths, or 1mm for the case cited above.  At an 
acoustic  velocity  cs  of  1000  m/s  a  new  wave  can  enter  the  device  after  L/cs  =  10-3/1000  =  10-6 
seconds. 

13.4.4  Surface-wave devices 

Only  compressive  acoustic waves have been discussed  so  far, but  acoustic  shear waves  can  also 
be  generated  in  solids,  and  exhibit  most  of  the  same  wave  phenomena  as  compressive  waves, 
such  as  guidance  and  resonance.  The  dominant  velocity  in  a  shear  wave  is  transverse  to  the 

- 418 -


direction of wave propagation.   By generating shear waves on  the surface of quartz devices, and 
by  periodically  loading  those  surfaces mechanically with  slots  or metal, multiple  reflections  are 
induced  that,  depending  on  their  spacing  relative  to  a  wavelength,  permit  band-pass  and  band-
stop  filters  to  be  constructed,  as  well  as  transformers,  resonators,  and  directional  couplers. 
Because  quartz  has  such  high  mechanical  Q,  it  is  often  used  to  construct  high-Q  resonators  at 
MHz frequencies.
