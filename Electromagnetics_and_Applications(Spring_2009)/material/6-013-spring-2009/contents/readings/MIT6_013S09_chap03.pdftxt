Introduction 

One  important  application  of  electromagnetic  field  analysis  is  to  simple  electronic  components 
such  as  resistors,  capacitors,  and  inductors,  all  of  which  exhibit  at  higher  frequencies 
characteristics of the others.  Such structures can be analyzed in terms of their: 1) static behavior, 
for which we  can  set  ∂/∂t  =  0  in Maxwell’s  equations,  2)  quasistatic  behavior,  for which  ∂/∂t  is 
non-negligible,  but  we  neglect  terms  of  the  order  ∂2/∂t2,  and  3)  dynamic  behavior,  for  which 
terms  on  the  order  of  ∂2/∂t2  are  not  negligible  either;  in  the  dynamic  case  the  wavelengths  of 
interest are no longer large compared to the device dimensions.  Because most such devices have 
either  cylindrical  or  planar  geometries,  as  discussed  in  Sections  1.3  and  1.4,  their  fields  and 
behavior  are  generally  easily  understood.    This  understanding  can  be  extrapolated  to  more 
complex structures. 

One  approach  to  analyzing  simple  structures  is  to  review  the  basic  constraints  imposed  by 
symmetry,  Maxwell’s  equations,  and  boundary  conditions,  and  then  to  hypothesize  the  electric 
and magnetic  fields  that would  result.   These hypotheses can  then be  tested  for consistency with 
any  remaining  constraints  not  already  invoked.    To  illustrate  this  approach  resistors,  capacitors, 
and inductors with simple shapes are analyzed in Sections 3.1–2 below. 

All  physical  elements  exhibit  varying  degrees  of  resistance,  inductance,  and  capacitance, 
depending  on  frequency.  This  is  because:  1)  essentially  all  conducting  materials  exhibit  some 
resistance, 2) all currents generate magnetic fields and therefore contribute inductance, and 3) all 
voltage  differences  generate  electric  fields  and  therefore  contribute  capacitance.    R’s,  L’s,  and 
C’s are designed to exhibit only one dominant property at low frequencies.  Section 3.3 discusses 
simple examples of ambivalent device behavior as frequency changes. 

Most  passive  electronic  components  have  two  or  more  terminals  where  voltages  can  be 
measured.    The  voltage  difference  between  any  two  terminals  of  a  passive  device  generally 
depends  on  the  histories  of  the  currents  through  all  the  terminals.   Common  passive  linear  two-
terminal  devices  include  resistors,  inductors,  and  capacitors  (R’s,  L’s.  and  C’s,  respectively), 
while  transformers  are  commonly  three-  or  four-terminal  devices.    Devices  with  even  more 
terminals  are  often  simply  characterized  as  N-port  networks.    Connected  sets  of  such  passive 
linear devices form passive  linear circuits which can be analyzed using  the methods discussed  in 
Section  3.4.   RLC  resonators  and RL  and RC  relaxation  circuits  are most  relevant  here  because 
their physics and behavior resemble those of common electromagnetic systems.  RLC resonators 
are  treated  in Section 3.5,  and RL, RC,  and LC  circuits  are  limiting  cases when one of  the  three 
elements becomes negligible. 

3.1.2  Resistors 

Resistors are two-terminal passive linear devices characterized by their resistance R [ohms]:

v = iR 

(3.1.1) 

where  v(t)  and  i(t)  are  the  associated  voltage  and  current.    That  is,  one  volt  across  a  one-ohm 
resistor induces a one-ampere current through it; this defines the ohm. 

The resistor illustrated in Figure 3.1.1 is comprised of two parallel perfectly conducting end-
plates  between which  is  placed  a medium  of  conductivity  σ,  permittivity  ε,  permeability  μ,  and 
thickness d; the two end plates and the medium all have a constant cross-sectional area A [m2] in 
the  x-y  plane.  Let’s  assume  a  static  voltage  v  exists  across  the  resistor  R,  and  that  a  current  i 
flows through it.

Boundary  conditions  require  the  electric  field  E   at  any  perfectly  conducting  plate  to  be 
perpendicular  to  it  [see  (2.6.16);  E × = 0 ],  and  Faraday’s  law  requires  that  any  line  integral  of 
nˆ
E  from one iso-potential end plate to the other must equal the voltage v regardless of the path of 
integration (1.3.13).   Because  the conductivity σ [Siemens/m]  is uniform within walls parallel  to 
zˆ , these constraints are satisfied by a static uniform electric field  E =  zˆE o  everywhere within the 
conducting medium, which would be charge-free since our assumed  E  is non-divergent.  Thus:

Such an electric field within the conducting medium induces a current density  J , where:

(3.1.5)

The  instantaneous  power  p  [W]  dissipated  in  a  resistor  is  i2R  =  v2/R,  and  the  time-average

power  dissipated  in  the  sinusoidal  steady  state  is  I R 2  = V  2 R    watts.    Alternatively  the

(3.1.6) 

which is the expected answer, and where we used (2.1.17):  J = σE . 

Surface  charges  reside  on  the  end  plates  where  the  electric  field  is  perpendicular  to  the 
perfect  conductor.    The  boundary  condition  nˆ • D = ρs   (2.6.15)  suggests  that  the  surface  charge 
density ρs on the positive end-plate face adjacent to the conducting medium is: 

ρ = εE   C  ⎡⎣
 
s 
o

-2 
⎤
m ⎦ 

(3.1.7)
 

The  total  static  charge  Q  on  the  positive  resistor  end  plate  is  therefore  ρsA  coulombs.    By 
convention,  the  subscript  s  distinguishes  surface  charge  density  ρs  [C  m-2]  from  volume  charge 
density  ρ  [C  m-3].  An  equal  negative  surface  charge  resides  on  the  other  end-plate.    The  total 
stored charged Q = ρsA = CV, where C is the device capacitance, as discussed further in Section 
3.1.3. 

The  static  currents  and  voltages  in  this  resistor  will  produce  fields  outside  the  resistor,  but 
these  produce  no  additional  current  or  voltage  at  the  device  terminals  and  are  not  of  immediate 
concern  here.  Similarly,  μ  and  ε  do  not  affect  the  static  value  of  R.   At  higher  frequencies, 
however,  this  resistance  R  varies  and  both  inductance  and  capacitance  appear,  as  shown  in  the 
following  three  sections.  Although  this  static  solution  for  charge,  current,  and  electric  field 
within  the  conducting  portion  of  the  resistor  satisfies Maxwell’s  equations,  a  complete  solution 
would  also  prove  uniqueness  and  consistency  with  H   and  Maxwell’s  equations  outside  the 
device.  Uniqueness  is  addressed  by  the  uniqueness  theorem  in  Section  2.8,  and  approaches  to 
finding fields for arbitrary device geometries are discussed briefly in Sections 4.4–6.

Example 3.1A 
Design  a  practical  100-ohm  resistor.    If  thermal  dissipation  were  a  problem,  how  might  that 
change the design? 

Solution:	 Resistance  R  =  d/σA  (3.1.5),  and  if  we  arbitrarily  choose  a  classic  cylindrical  shape 
with  resistor  length  d  =  4r,  where  r  is  the  radius,  then  A  =  πr2  =  πd2/16  and 
R  =  16/πdσ =  100.  Discrete  resistors  are  smaller  for  modern  low  power  compact 
circuits,  so  we  might  set  d  =  1  mm,  yielding  σ =  16/πdR  =  16/(π10-3×100)  ≅ 
51 S m-1.  Such conductivities roughly correspond, for example, to very salty water or 
carbon  powder.  The  surface  area  of  the  resistor  must  be  sufficient  to  dissipate  the 
maximum  power  expected,  however.    Flat  resistors  thermally  bonded  to  a  heat  sink 
can be smaller than air-cooled devices, and these are often made of thin metallic film. 
Some resistors are long wires wound in coils.  Resistor failure often occurs where the 
local  resistance  is  slightly  higher,  and  the  resulting  heat  typically  increases  the  local 
resistance further, causing even more local heating. 

3.1.3  Capacitors 

Capacitors  are  two-terminal  passive  linear  devices  storing  charge  Q  and  characterized  by  their 
capacitance C [Farads], defined by: 

Q = Cv  [Coulombs]	

(3.1.8) 

where  v(t)  is  the  voltage  across  the  capacitor.    That  is,  one  static  volt  across  a  one-Farad 
capacitor  stores  one  Coulomb  on  each  terminal,  as  discussed  further  below;  this  defines  the 
Farad [Coulombs per volt]. 

The  resistive  structure  illustrated  in  Figure  3.1.1  becomes  a  pure  capacitor  at  low 
frequencies if the media conductivity σ → 0.  Although some capacitors are air-filled with ε ≅ εo, 
usually dielectric  filler with permittivity ε > εo  is used. Typical values for  the dielectric constant 
ε/εo  used  in  capacitors  are  ~1-100.    In  all  cases  boundary  conditions  again  require  that  the 
electric  field  E   be  perpendicular  to  the  perfectly  conducting  end  plates,  i.e.,  to  be  in  the  ±z 
direction, and Faraday’s law requires that any line integral of  E  from one iso-potential end plate 
to  the  other must  equal  the  voltage  v  across  the  capacitor.    These  constraints  are  again  satisfied 
by  a  static  uniform  electric  field  E = zˆE o   within  the  medium  separating  the  plates,  which  is 
uniform and charge-free. 

We  shall  neglect  temporarily  the  effects  of  all  fields  produced  outside  the  capacitor  if  its 
plate  separation  d  is  small  compared  to  its  diameter,  a  common  configuration.    Thus  Eo  =  v/d 
[V  m-1]  (3.1.2).  The  surface  charge  density  on  the  positive  end-plate  face  adjacent  to  the 
conducting medium is σs = εEo  [C m-2], and the total static charge Q on the positive end plate of 
area A is therefore: 

= Cv [C ]
Q  A s	 A E o  A v d  
= σ = ε 
= ε

Therefore, for a parallel-plate capacitor: 

C = εA d   F[ arads

]  
 

 

(parallel-plate capacitor) 

(3.1.10) 

Using (3.1.2) and the fact that the charge Q(t) on the positive plate is the time integral of the 
current i(t) into it, we obtain the relation between voltage and current for a capacitor: 

C = (

v t( ) = Q ( )t

(3.1.11)

(3.1.12)
 

When  two capacitors are connected  in parallel as shown  in Figure 3.1.2,  they are equivalent 
to a single capacitor of value Ceq storing charge Qeq, where these values are easily found in terms 
of the charges (Q1, Q2) and capacitances (C1, C2) associated with the two separate devices.

Because  the  total  charge  Qeq  is  the  sum  of  the  charges  on  the  two  separate  capacitors,  and 
capacitors in parallel have the same voltage v, it follows that: 

Qeq = Q1 + Q2 = (C1 + C2)v = Ceqv

When  two  capacitors  are  connected  in  series,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  3.1.3,  then  their  two 
charges Q1 and Q2 remain equal if they were equal before current i(t) began to flow, and the total 
voltage is the sum of the voltages across each capacitor:

(3.1.15) 

The instantaneous electric energy density We [J m-3] between the capacitor plates is given by 
2
Poynting’s theorem:  We = ε E  2  (2.7.7).  The  total electric energy we stored  in  the capacitor  is 
the integral of We over the volume Ad of the dielectric: 
w e  = ∫∫∫  ( ε E
)

The corresponding expression  for  the  time-average energy stored  in a capacitor  in  the sinusoidal 
steady state is:

The extra factor of two relative to (3.1.9) enters because the time average of a sinsuoid squared is 
half its peak value.

We can also analyze other capacitor geometries,  such as  the cylindrical capacitor  illustrated 
in  Figure  3.1.4.    The  inner  radius  is  “a”,  the  outer  radius  is  “b”,  and  the  length  is D;  its  interior 
has permittivity ε.

The electric field again must be divergence- and curl-free in the charge-free regions between 
the  two  cylinders,  and  must  be  perpendicular  to  the  inner  and  outer  cylinders  at  their  perfectly 
conducting walls.  The  solution  can  be  cylindrically  symmetric  and  independent  of  φ.  A  purely 
radial electric field has these properties:

The  electric  potential  Φ(r)  is  the  integral  of  the  electric  field,  so  the  potential  difference  v

This  capacitor  voltage  produces  a  surface  charge  density  ρs  on  the  inner  and  outer 
conductors, where ρs = εE = εEo/r.  If Φa > Φb,  then  the  inner cylinder  is positively charged,  the 
outer cylinder is negatively charged, and Eo is positive.  The total charge Q on the inner cylinder 
is then:

(3.1.21) 

In  the  limit where  b/a →  1  and  b  -  a  =  d,  then we  have  approximately  a  parallel-plate  capacitor 
with C → εA/d where the plate area A = 2πaD; see (3.1.10). 

Example 3.1B 
Design a practical 100-volt 10-8 farad (0.01 mfd) capacitor using dielectric having ε = 20εo and a 
breakdown field strength E  of 107 [V m-1
]. 
B

Solution:	 For  parallel-plate  capacitors  C  =  εA/d  (3.1.10),  and  the  device  breakdown  voltage  is 
EBd  =  100  [V].  Therefore  the  plate  separation  d  =  100/EB  =  10-5  [m].   With  a  safety 
factor  of  two,  d  doubles  to  2×10-5,  so  A  =  dC/ε  =  2×10-5  ×  10-8/(20  ×  6.85×10-12)  ≅ 
1.5×103  [m2].  If  the  capacitor  is  a  cube  of  side D,  then  the  capacitor  volume  is D3 = 
Ad  and D  =  (Ad)0.333 =  (1.5×10-3  × 2×10-5)0.333  ≅  3.1 mm.   To  simplify manufacture, 
such capacitors are usually wound in cylinders or cut from flat stacked sheets. 

3.2 

Inductors and transformers 

3.2.1 

Solenoidal inductors 

All  currents  in  devices  produce  magnetic  fields  that  store  magnetic  energy  and  therefore 
contribute  inductance  to  a  degree  that  depends  on  frequency.   When  two  circuit  branches  share 
magnetic  fields,  each will  typically  induce  a  voltage  in  the  other,  thus  coupling  the  branches  so 
they form a transformer, as discussed in Section 3.2.4. 

- 71 -


	
Inductors  are  two-terminal  passive  devices  specifically  designed  to  store  magnetic  energy, 
particularly  at  frequencies  below  some  design-dependent  upper  limit.    One  simple  geometry  is 
shown  in  Figure  3.2.1  in  which  current  i(t)  flows  in  a  loop  through  two  perfectly  conducting 
parallel plates of width W and length D, spaced d apart, and short-circuited at one end.

(3.2.1)

The  contour  C1  around  both  currents  in  Figure  3.2.1  encircles  zero  net  current,  and  (3.2.1)  says 
the  contour  integral  of  H   around  zero  net  current  must  be  zero  in  the  static  case.    Contour  C2 
encircles only the current i(t), so the contour integral of  H  around any C2 in the right-hand sense 
equals  i(t)  for  the  static case.   The values of  these  two contour  integrals are consistent with zero 
magnetic  field outside  the pair of plates and a constant  field  H = H o yˆ  between  them, although a 
uniform  magnetic  field  could  be  superimposed  everywhere  without  altering  those  integrals. 
Since such a uniform field would not have  the same symmetry as  this device, such a field would 
have to be generated elsewhere.  These integrals are also exactly consistent with fringing fields at 
the edges of  the plate, as  illustrated  in Figure 3.2.1(b)  in  the x-y plane  for z > 0.   Fringing  fields 
can usually be neglected if the plate separation d is much less than the plate width W. 

It follows that:

Since  we  assumed  fringing  fields  could  be  neglected  because  W  >>  d,  large  single-turn 
inductors  require  very  large  structures.    The  standard  approach  to  increasing  inductance  L  in  a 
limited volume is instead to use multi-turn coils as illustrated in Figure 3.2.3.

therefore  the magnetic  field Ho  and  flux ψm  are  also N  times  stronger  than  before.   At  the  same 
time  the  voltage  induced  in  each  turn  is  proportional  to  the  flux ψm  through  it, which  is  now N 
times greater than for a single-turn coil (ψm = NiμA/W), and the total voltage across the inductor 
is  the sum of  the voltages across  the N  turns.   Therefore, provided  that W >> d,  the  total voltage 
across an N-turn  inductor  is N2  times  its one-turn value, and  the  inductance LN of an N-turn coil 
is also N2 greater than L1 for a one-turn coil:

where A is the coil area and W is its length; W >> 

A  > d. 

Equation  (3.2.11)  also  applies  to  cylindrical  coils  having  W  >>  d,  which  is  the  most 
common  form of  inductor.  To  achieve  large values of N  the  turns of wire  can be wound on  top 
of each other with little adverse effect; (3.2.11) still applies. 

These  expressions  can  also  be  simplified  by  defining  magnetic  flux  linkage  Λ as  the 
magnetic flux ψm (3.2.7) linked by N turns of the current i, where: 

Λ = Nψm = N(NiμA/W) = (N2μA/W)i = Li 

(flux linkage) 

(3.2.12) 

This  equation  Λ  =  Li  is  dual  to  the  expression  Q  =  Cv  for  capacitors.   We  can  use  (3.2.5)  and 
(3.2.12) to express the voltage v across N turns of a coil as: 

v = L di/dt = dΛ/dt

The net  inductance L of  two  inductors L1  and L2  in  series or parallel  is  related  to L1  and L2 
in the same way two connected resistors are related:

For  example,  two  inductors  in  series  convey  the  same  current  i  but  the  total  voltage  across  the 
pair is the sum of the voltages across each – so the inductances add. 

Example 3.2A 
Design a 100-Henry air-wound inductor. 

Solution:  	 Equation  (3.2.11)  says L = N2μA/W,  so N  and  the  form  factor A/W must  be  chosen. 
Since A = πr2 is the area of a cylindrical inductor of radius r, then W = 4r implies L = 
N2μπr/4.  Although  tiny  inductors  (small  r)  can  be  achieved  with  a  large  number  of 
turns N, N is limited by the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the coil rW and of the 
w , and is N ≅ r2/r 2
wire πr 2
w .  N is further limited if we want the resistive impedance R 
<<  jωL.  If  ωmin  is  the  lowest  frequency  of  interest,  then  we  want  R  ≅ ωminL/100  = 
d/(σπr 2
w ) [see (3.1.5)], where  the wire  length d ≅  2πrN.  These constraints eventually 
yield  the  desired  values  for  r  and  N  that  yield  the  smallest  inductor.    Example  3.2B 
carries these issues further. 

3.2.2  Toroidal inductors 

The prior discussion assumed μ  filled all  space.    If μ  is  restricted  to  the  interior of a  solenoid, L 
is  diminished  significantly,  but  coils  wound  on  a  high-μ  toroid,  a  donut-shaped  structure  as 
illustrated  in Figure 3.2.3(b), yield  the  full benefit of high values  for μ.  Typical values of μ  are 
~5000 to 180,000 for iron, and up to ~106 for special materials. 

Coils  wound  on  high-permeability  toroids  exhibit  significantly  less  flux  leakage  than 
solenoids.    Consider  the  boundary  between  air  and  a  high-permeability  material  (μ/μo  >>1),  as 
illustrated in Figure 3.2.4.

The  degree  to  which  B   is  parallel  or  perpendicular  to  the  illustrated  boundary  has  been 
diminished  substantially  for  the  purpose  of  clarity.    The  boundary  conditions  are  that  both  B⊥ 
and  H //  are continuous across any interface (2.6.5, 2.6.11).  Since  B = μH  in the permeable core 
and  B = μo H   in  air,  and  since  H //   is  continuous  across  the  boundary,  therefore  B//   changes 
In  contrast,  B⊥   is  the  same  on  both  sides. 
across  the  boundary  by  the  large  factor  μ/μο. 
Therefore,  as  suggested  in  Figure  3.2.4,  B2   in  air  is  nearly  perpendicular  to  the  boundary 
because  H // , and  therefore⎯B2//,  is so very small; note  that  the  figure has been scaled so  that  the 
arrows representing⎯H2 and⎯B2 have the same length when μ = μ0.

In  contrast,  B1   is  nearly  parallel  to  the  boundary  and  is  therefore  largely  trapped  there,  even  if 
that boundary curves, as shown  for a  toroid  in Figure 3.2.5.   The  reason magnetic  flux  is  largely 
trapped  within  high-μ  materials  is  also  closely  related  to  the  reason  current  is  trapped  within 
high-σ wires, as described in Section 4.3. 

The  inductance  of  a  toroidal  inductor  is  simply  related  to  the  linked  magnetic  flux  Λ  by 
(3.2.12) and (3.2.7): 

ΛL =

where A is any cross-sectional area of the toroid.

(toroidal inductor) 

(3.2.16)

 
Computing  H   is  easier  if  the  toroid  is  circular  and  has  a  constant  cross-section A which  is 
small  compared  to  the major  radius R  so  that R >>  A .  From Ampere’s  law we  learn  that  the 
integral of  H  around the 2πR circumference of this toroid is: 
(cid:118)∫ H • ds ≅ 2  πR  H  ≅ Ni
C 

(3.2.17)

 

where  the  only  linked  current  is  i(t)  flowing  through  the  N  turns  of  wire  threading  the  toroid. 
Equation  (3.2.17) yields H ≅ Ni/2πR and  (3.2.16)  relates H  to L.  Therefore  the  inductance L of 
such a toroid found from (3.2.16) and (3.2.17) is:

The  inductance  is  proportional  to  μ, N2,  and  cross-sectional  area  A,  but  declines  as  the  toroid 
major  radius  R  increases.    The  most  compact  large-L  toroids  are  therefore  fat  (large  A)  with 
almost  no  hole  in  the  middle  (small  R);  the  hole  size  is  determined  by  N  (made  as  large  as 
possible) and  the wire diameter  (made  small).   The maximum acceptable  series  resistance of  the 
inductor limits N and the wire diameter; for a given wire mass [kg] this resistance is proportional 
to N2.

The  inductance  of  a  high-permeability  toroid  is  strongly  reduced  if  even  a  small  gap  of 
width d exists  in  the magnetic path, as shown in Figure 3.2.6.   The inductance L of a toroid with 
a gap of width d  can be  found using  (3.2.16), but  first we must  find  the magnitude of Hμ within 
the  toroid.  Again we  can  use  the  integral  form  of Ampere’s  law  for  a  closed  contour  along  the 
axis of the toroid, encircling the hole.

where  Hg  is  the  magnitude  of  H  within  the  gap.   Since  B⊥   is  continuous  across  the  gap  faces, 
μoHg  =  μHμ  and  these  two  equations  can  be  solved  for  the  two  unknowns,  Hg  and  Hμ.  The 
second  term Hgd can be neglected  if  the gap width d << 2πRμo/μ.  In  this  limiting case we have 
the same inductance as before, (3.2.18).  However, if A0.5 > d >> 2πRμo/μ, then Hg  ≅ Ni/d and:

Relative to (3.2.18) the inductance has been reduced by a factor of μo/μ and increased by a much 
smaller factor of 2πR/d, a significant net reduction even though the gap is small. 

Equation  (3.2.20)  suggests  how  small  air  gaps  in  magnetic  motors  limit  motor  inductance 
and  sometimes  motor  torque,  as  discussed  further  in  Section  6.3.    Gaps  can  be  useful  too.  For 
example,  if  μ is  non-linear  [μ =  f  (H)],  then  L  ≠  f (H)  if  the  gap  and  μo  dominate  L.    Also, 
inductance  dominated  by  gaps  can  store  more  energy  when  H  exceeds  saturation  (i.e.,

That  (3.2.22)  is  valid  and  exact  for  any  inductance  L  can  be  shown  using  Poynting’s  theorem, 
which relates power P = vi at the device terminals to changes in energy storage:

(3.2.23)

Earlier  we  neglected  fringing  fields,  but  they  store  magnetic  energy  too.   We  can  compute 
them  accurately  using  the  Biot-Savart  law  (10.2.21),  which  is  derived  later  and  expresses  H 
directly in terms of the currents flowing in the inductor:

⎡
⎣4π r − r '  ⎦ 

(3.2.24) 

The  magnetic  field  produced  by  current  J ( r ')   diminishes  with  distance  squared,  and  therefore 
the  magnitude  of  the  uniform  field  H   within  the  inductor  is  dominated  by  currents  within  a 
distance of ~d of  the  inductor ends, where d  is  the nominal diameter or  thickness of  the  inductor 
[see  Figure  3.2.3(a)  and  assume  d  ≅ D  << W].    Therefore  H   at  the  center  of  the  end-face  of  a 
semi-infinite  cylindrical  inductor  has  precisely  half  the  strength  it  has  near  the  middle  of  the 
same  inductor  because  the  Biot-Savart  contributions  to  H   at  the  end-face  arise  only  from  one 
side of the end-face, not from both sides. 

The energy density within a solenoidal inductor therefore diminishes within a distance of ~d 
from  each  end,  but  this  is  partially  compensated  in  (3.2.23)  by  the  neglected  magnetic  energy 
outside  the  inductor,  which  also  decays  within  a  distance  ~d.    For  these  reasons  fringing  fields 
are usually neglected  in  inductance  computations when d << W.   Because magnetic  flux  is non-
divergent, the reduced field intensity near the ends of solenoids implies that some magnetic field 
lines escape the coil there; they are fully trapped within the rest of the coil.

Example 3.2B 
Design  a  practical  100-Henry  inductor wound  on  a  toroid  having  μ  =  104μo;  it  is  to  be  used  for 
ω ≅  400  [r  s-1]  (~60  Hz).  How  many  Joules  can  it  store  if  the  current  is  one  Ampere?  If  the 
residual flux density Br of the toroid is 0.2 Tesla, how does this affect design? 

Solution: 	 We have at least three unknowns, i,e., size, number of turns N, and wire radius rw, and 
therefore need at least three equations.  Equation (3.2.18) says L ≅ μN2A/2πRm where 
A  =  πr2.  A  fat  toroid  might  have  major  radius  Rm  ≅  3r,  corresponding  to  a  central 
hole  of  radius  2r  surrounded  by  an  iron  torus  2r  thick,  yielding  an  outer  diameter  of 
4r.  Our  first  equation  follows:  L  =  100  ≅ μN2r/6.  Next,  the  number  N  of  turns  is 
limited  by  the  ratio  of  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the  hole  in  the  torus  (π4r2)  and  the 
w ;  our  second  equation  is  N  ≅  4r2/r 2
cross-sectional  area  of  the  wire  πr 2
w .  Although 
tiny  inductors  (small  r)  can  be  achieved  with  large  N,  N  is  limited  if  we  want  the 
resistive  impedance  R  <<  ωL.  If  ωmin  is  the  lowest  frequency  of  interest,  then  we 
2
obtain  our  third  equation,  R  ≅ ω
minL/100  =  400  =  d/(σπrw )  [see  (3.1.5)],  where  the 
w  from the second and third equation yields N2  ≅ 
wire length d ≅ 4πrN.  Eliminating r 2
400σr, and eliminating N2 from  the first equation yields r = (600/400σμ)0.5  ≅ 1.5mm, 
where  for  typical  wires  σ ≅  5×107;  the  maximum  diameter  of  this  toroid  is  8r  ≅  1.2 
cm. Since N2  ≅ 400σr, therefore N ≅ 5600, and rw  ≅ 2r/  N ≅ 40 microns. 

We might suppose the stored energy wm = Li2/2 = 100×12/2 = 50 joules.  However, if 
1  ampere  flows  through  5600  turns,  and  if  H  =  5600/2π3r  =  5600/0.031  =  1.8×105 
[A  m-1],  then  B  =  μH  ≅  2300  Tesla,  well  above  the  limit  of  Br  =  0.2  Tesla  where 
saturation  was  said  to  occur.    Since  the  incremental  μo  applies  at  high  currents,  this 
device  is  quite  non-linear  and  the  computed  stored  energy  of  50J  should  be  reduced 
by  a  factor  of  ~μo/μ  to  yield  ~5  mJ.    If  linearity  and  low  loss  (R<<ωL)  are  desired, 
either  this  toroid must  be made much  larger  so  that  the  upper  limit  on  μH  inside  the 
toroid  is  not  exceeded,  or  the  maximum  current  must  be  reduced  to  the  ~100  μA 
level.  Moreover,  a  sinusoidal  current  of  1  ampere  through  this  small  400-ohm 
resistance would dissipate 200 W, enough to damage it.  Note that if ωmin is increased 
by a factor of F, then r decreases by F0.5.

3.2.4  Transformers 

Transformers  are  passive  devices  used  to  raise  or  lower  the  voltages  of  alternating  currents  or 
transients.    The  voltage  v  across  two  terminals  of  any  coil  can  be  found  using  Faraday’s  law

Its  high  permeability  traps  the  magnetic  flux  within  it  so  that  ψm  is  constant  around  the  toroid, 
even though A varies.  From (3.2.28) we see that the voltage vk across coil k is therefore:

where N2/N1 is the transformer turns ratio.

(3.2.30)

(3.2.31)

If current i2 flows in the output coil, then there will be an added contribution to v1 and v2 due 
 
to  the  contributions of  i2  to  the original ψm  from  the  input  coil  alone.  Note  that  current  flowing 
into  the  “+”  terminal  of  both  coils  in  the  figure  contribute  to⎯H  in  the  illustrated  direction;  this 

- 80 -


distinguishes  the  positive  terminal  from  the  negative  terminal  of  each  coil.    If  the  flux  coupling 
between  the  two  coils  is  imperfect,  then  the  output  voltage  is  correspondingly  reduced.    Any 
resistance in the wires can increment these voltages in proportion to the currents. 

Figure  3.2.8  suggests  traditional  symbols  used  to  represent  ideal  transformers  and  some 
common configurations used in practice.  The polarity dot at the end of each coil indicates which 
terminals would register  the same voltage for a given change  in  the  linked magnetic flux.   In  the 
absence of dots,  the polarity  indicated  in  (a)  is understood.   Note  that many  transformers consist 
of  a  single  coil  with  multiple  taps.    Sometimes  one  of  the  taps  is  a  commutator  that  can  slide 
across  the  coil  windings  to  provide  a  continuously  variable  transformer  turns  ratio.    As 
illustrated,  the  presence  of  an  iron  core  is  indicated  by  parallel  lines  and  an  auto-transformer 
consists of only one tapped coil.

The  terminal  voltages  of  linear  transformers  for  which  μ ≠  f(H)  are  linearly  related  to  the 
various currents flowing through the windings.  Consider a simple toroid for which H, B, and the 
cross-sectional  area  A  are  the  same  everywhere  around  the  average  circumference  πD.    In  this  
case the voltage V1 across the N1 turns of coil (1) is: 

V1 = jωN1 

Ψ = μHA 

H = (N1I1 + N2I2)/πD 

Therefore: 

V1 = jω[μAN1(N1I1 + N2I2)/πD] = jω(L11I1 + L12I2) 

where the self-inductance L11 and mutual inductance L12 [Henries] are: 

L11 = μAN 2

Combining  (3.2.33)  and  (3.2.34),  and  noting  that  the  sign  of  I2  has  been  reversed  in  the 
figure, we obtain the expression for total flux: 

Ψ = μA (N1I1 + N2I2)/πD 

(3.2.38) 

We can find the admittance seen by the voltage source by solving (3.2.38) for I1 and dividing by 
Vs: 

I1 = (πDΨ/μAN1) + I2 N2/N1 

Vs = jωN1Ψ = V2N1/N2 = I2RN1/N2

(3.2.42) 

Thus the admittance seen at the input to the transformer is that of the self-inductance (1/jωL11) in 
parallel with  the  admittance  of  the  transformed  resistance  [(N2/N1)2/R].   The  power  delivered  to 
the  load  is  |V2|2/2R  =  |V1|2(N2/N1)2/2R,  which  is  the  time-average  power  delivered  to  the 
transformer, since |V2|2 = |V1|2(N2/N1)2; see (3.2.31). 

The  transformer  equivalent  circuit  is  thus  L11  in  parallel  with  the  input  of  an  ideal 
transformer  with  turns  ratio  N2/N1.  Resistive  losses  in  the  input  and  output  coils  could  be 
represented by  resistors  in  series with  the  input and output  lines.   Usually  jωL11  for an  iron-core 
transformer is so great that only the ideal transformer is important. 

One  significant  problem  with  iron-core  transformers  is  that  the  changing  magnetic  fields 
within them can generate considerable voltages and eddy currents by virtue of Ohm’s Law (⎯J = 
σ⎯E) and Faraday’s law:

(3.2.43) 

where  the  contour C  circles  each  conducting   magnetic  element.   A  simple  standard method  for 
reducing  the  eddy  currents⎯J  and  the  associated  dissipated  power  ∫V  (σ|J|2/2)dv  is  to  reduce  the 
area  A  by  laminating  the  core;  i.e.,  by  fabricating  it  with  thin  stacked  insulated  slabs  of  iron  or 
steel oriented so as to interrupt the eddy currents.  The eddy currents flow perpendicular to⎯H, so 
the slab should be sliced along  the direction of⎯H.  If N stacked slabs  replace a single slab,  then 
A,  E,  and  J  are  each  reduced  roughly  by  a  factor  of  N,  so  the  power  dissipated,  which  is 
proportional to the square of J, is reduced by a factor of ~N2.  Eddy currents and laminated cores 
are discussed further at the end of Section 4.3.3. 

3.3  Quasistatic behavior of devices 

3.3.1  Electroquasistatic behavior of devices 

The  voltages  and  currents  associated  with  all  interesting  devices  sometimes  vary.    If  the 
wavelength  λ  =  c/f  associated  with  these  variations  is  much  larger  than  the  device  size  D,  no 
significant  wave  behavior  can  occur.  The  device  behavior  can  then  be  characterized  as 
electroquasistatic  if  the  device  stores  primarily  electric  energy,  and  magnetoquasistatic  if  the 
device  stores  primarily  magnetic  energy.    Electroquasistatics  involves  the  behavior  of  electric 
fields  plus  the  first-order  magnetic  consequences  of  their  variations.    The  electroquasistatic 
approximation  includes  the  magnetic  field⎯H  generated  by  the  varying  dominant  electric  field 
(Ampere’s law), where:  

∇ × H = σE +

∂D 
∂t 

(3.3.1)

The  quasistatic  approximation  neglects  the  second-order  electric  field  contributions  from  the 
/ ∂t  ≅ 0 . 
time derivative of the resulting⎯H in Faraday’s law:  ∇ × =E  −μ ∂H  
o 

One  simple  geometry  involving  slowly  varying  electric  fields  is  a  capacitor  charged  to 
voltage V(t),  as  illustrated  in  Figure  3.3.1.  It  consists  of  two  circular  parallel  conducting  plates 
of  diameter  D  and  area  A  that  are  separated  in  vacuum  by  the  distance  d  <<  D.    Boundary 
conditions  require⎯E  to  be  perpendicular  to  the  plates,  where  E(t)  =  V(t)/d,  and  the  surface 
charge density is given by (2.6.15):

Since  the  voltage  across  the  plates  is  the  same  everywhere,  so  are⎯E  and  ρs,  and  therefore  the 
total charge is: 

Q(t) ≅ ρsA ≅ (εoA/d)V = CV(t) 

(3.3.4) 

where C ≅ εoA/d  is  the  capacitance,  as  shown  earlier  (3.1.10).   The  same  surface  charge density 
ρs(t)  can  also  be  found  by  evaluating  first  the  magnetic  field⎯H(r,t)  produced  by  the  slowly 
varying  (quasistatic)  electric  field⎯E(t),  and  then  the  surface  current⎯Js(r,t)  associated 
with⎯H(r,t); charge conservation then links⎯Js(r,t) to ρs(t). 

Ampere’s law requires a non-zero magnetic field between the plates where⎯J = 0: 
•  = ε o ∫∫ A ′ ( ∂E ∂t ) • da 
(cid:118)∫C
H ds  
Symmetry  of  geometry  and  excitation  requires  that⎯H  between  the  plates  be  in  the  φˆ direction 
and a function only of radius r, so (3.3.5) becomes: 

(3.3.5) 

2πr H(r) = εoπr2 dE/dt = (εoπr2/d) dV/dt 

H(r) = (εor/2d) dV/dt 

(3.3.6) 

(3.3.7) 

If V(t)  and  the magnetic  field H  are  varying  so  slowly  that  the  electric  field  given  by  Faraday’s 
law  for H(r)  is much  less  than  the  original  electric  field,  then  that  incremental  electric  field  can 
be  neglected,  which  is  the  essence  of  the  electroquasistatic  approximation.    If  it  cannot  be 
neglected, then the resulting solution becomes more wavelike, as discussed in later sections. 

The boundary condition  nˆ  ×⎯H =⎯Js (2.6.17) then yields the associated surface current⎯Js(r) 
flowing on the interior surface of the top plate: 

⎯Js(r) =  rˆ (εor/2d) dV/dt =  rˆ Jsr 

(3.3.8) 

- 84 -


This  in  turn  is  related  to  the  surface charge density ρs by conservation of charge  (2.1.19), where 
the del operator is in cylindrical coordinates: 

∇ •⎯Js = -∂ρs/∂t = - r-1∂ (r Jsr)/∂r 

Substituting Jsr from (3.3.8) into the right-hand side of (3.3.9) yields: 

∂ρs/∂t = (εo/d) dV/dt 

(3.3.9) 

(3.3.10) 

Multiplying both  sides of  (3.3.10) by  the plate  area A  and  integrating over  time  then yields Q(t) 
=  CV(t),  which  is  the  same  as  (3.3.4).    Thus  we  could  conclude  that  variations  in  V(t)  will 
produce  magnetic  fields  between  capacitor  plates  by  virtue  of  Ampere’s  law  and  the  values  of 
either  D t   between  the  capacitor  plates  or
⎯Js  within  the  plates.    These  two  approaches  to
∂
∂
finding⎯H  (using  D t
∂   or⎯Js)  yield  the  same  result  because  of  the  self-consistency  of 
∂
Maxwell’s equations. 

Because  the curl of⎯H  in Ampere’s  law equals  the sum of current density⎯J and  D t
∂ ,  th  e 
∂
∂  is often called the displacement current density because the units are the same, 
derivative  D t
∂
A/m2.  For  the  capacitor  of  Figure  3.3.1  the  curl  of⎯H  near  the  feed  wires  is  associated  only 
with⎯J  (or  I),  whereas  between  the  capacitor  plates  the  curl  of⎯H  is  associated  only  with 
displacement current. 

Section  3.3.4  treats  the  electroquasistatic  behavior  of  electric  fields  within  conductors  and 
relaxation phenomena. 

3.3.2  Magnetoquasistatic behavior of devices 

All  currents  produce magnetic  fields  that  in  turn  generate  electric  fields  if  those magnetic  fields 
vary.  Magnetoquasistatics  characterizes  the  behavior  of  such  slowly  varying  fields  while 
neglecting the second-order magnetic fields generated by  ∂D t∂  in Ampere’s law, (2.1.6): 

∇ × H = J + ∂D   ∂t ≅ J  

(quasistatic Ampere’s law) 

(3.3.11)

The associated electric field⎯E can then be found from Faraday's law: 

∇ × E = −∂B   ∂t  

(Faraday’s law) 

(3.3.12) 

Section  3.2.1  treated  an  example  for  which  the  dominant  effect  of  the  quasistatic  magnetic 
field  in  a  current  loop  is  voltage  induced  via  Faraday’s  law,  while  the  example  of  a  short  wire 
follows;  both  are  inductors.  Section  3.3.4  treats  the  magnetoquasistatic  example  of  magnetic 
diffusion,  which  is  dominated  by  currents  induced  by  the  first-order  induced  voltages,  and 
resulting  modification  of  the  original  magnetic  field  by  those  induced  currents.    In  every 
quasistatic  problem  wave  effects  can  be  neglected  because  the  associated  wavelength  λ  >>  D, 
where D is the maximum device dimension.

We  can  roughly  estimate  the  inductance  of  a  short  wire  segment  by  modeling  it  as  a 
perfectly  conducting  cylinder  of  radius  ro  and  length  D  carrying  a  current  i(t),  as  illustrated  in 
Figure 3.3.2.  An  exact  computation would normally be done using  computer  tools designed  for 
such  tasks because analytic solutions are practical only  for extremely simple geometries.    In  this 
analysis  we  neglect  any  contributions  to⎯H  from  currents  in  nearby  conductors,  which  requires 
those  nearby  conductors  to  have  much  larger  diameters  or  be  far  away.    We  also  make  the 
   
quasistatic assumption λ >> D.

We  know  from  (3.2.23)  that  the  inductance  of  any  device  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the

Therefore  to  estimate  L  we  first  estimate  H   and  wm.  If  the  cylinder  were  infinitely  long  then 
H ≅θˆ H ( )r   must obey Ampere’s law and exhibit the same cylindrical symmetry, as suggested in 
the figure.  Therefore:

To  find  the  total  average  stored magnetic  energy we must  integrate  over  volume.   Laterally 
we  can  neglect  fringing  fields  and  simply  integrate  over  the  length D.    Integration with  respect 
 
to  radius  will  produce  a  logarithmic  answer  that  becomes  infinite  if  the  maximum  radius  is 
infinite.    A  plausible  outer  limit  for  r  is  ~D  because  the  Biot-Savart  law  (1.4.6)  says  fields 
decrease  as  r2  from  their  source  if  that  source  is  local;  the  transition  from  slow  cylindrical  field 
decay  as  r-1  to  decay  as  r-2  occurs  at  distances  r  comparable  to  the  largest  dimension  of  the 
source: r ≅ D.  With these approximations we find:

inductance than the sum of shorter elements into which they might be subdivided. 

3.3.3  Equivalent circuits for simple devices 

Section  3.1  showed  how  the  parallel  plate  resistor  of  Figure  3.1.1  would  exhibit  resistance  R  = 
d/σA  ohms  and  capacitance  C  =  εA/d  farads,  connected  in  parallel.    The  currents  in  the  same 
device also generate magnetic fields and add inductance.  

Referring  to  Figure  3.1.1  of  the  original  parallel  plate  resistor,  most  of  the  inductance  will 
arise  from  the wires,  since  they have  a very  small  radius  ro  compared  to  that of  the plates.   This 
inductance L will be in series with the RC portions of the device because their two voltage drops 
add.  The R and C components are  in parallel because  the  total current  through  the device  is  the 
sum  of  the  conduction  current  and  the  displacement  current,  and  the  voltages  driving  these  two 
currents are  the same,  i.e.,  the voltage between  the parallel plates.   The corresponding first-order 
equivalent circuit is illustrated in Figure 3.3.3.

Figure 3.3.3  Equivalent RLC circuit of a parallel-plate capacitor. 
 

Examination  of  Figure  3.3.3  suggests  that  at  very  low  frequencies  the  resistance  R 
dominates because,  relative  to  the  resistor,  the  inductor and capacitor become approximate  short 
and  open  circuits,  respectively.    At  the  highest  frequencies  the  inductor  dominates.    As  f 
increases  from  zero  beyond where R  dominates,  either  the RL  or  the RC  circuit  first  dominates, 
depending  on whether C  shorts  the  resistance R  at  lower  frequencies  than when  L  open-circuits 
R;  that  is,  RC  dominates  first  when  R  >  L/C .    At  still  higher  frequencies  the  LC  circuit 
dominates,  followed  by L  alone.    For  certain  combinations  of R, L,  and C,  some  transitions  can 
merge.

Even  this  model  for  a  resistor  is  too  simple;  for  example,  the  wires  also  exhibit  resistance 
and  there  is magnetic energy stored between the end plates because  ∂D dt  ≠ 0  there.  Since such 
parasitic  effects  typically  become  important  only  at  frequencies  above  the  frequency  range 
specified for  the device,  they are normally neglected.   Even more complex behavior can result  if 
the  frequencies are so high  that  the device dimensions exceed ~λ/8, as discussed  later  in Section 
7.1.  Similar  considerations  apply  to  every  resistor,  capacitor,  inductor,  or  transformer 
manufactured.   Components and circuits designed  for very high  frequencies minimize unwanted 
parasitic  capacitance  and  parasitic  inductance  by  their  very  small  size  and  proper  choice  of 
materials and geometry.  It is common for circuit designers using components or wires near their 
design  limits  to  model  them  with  simple  lumped-element  equivalent  circuits  like  that  of  Figure 
3.3.3, which include the dominant parasitic effects.  The form of these circuits obviously depends 
on the detailed structure of the modeled device; for example, R and C might be in series. 

Example 3.3A 
What  are  the  approximate  values  L  and  C  for  the100-Ω  resistor  designed  in  Example  3.1A  if 
ε = 4εo, and what are the three critical frequencies (RC)-1, R/L, and (LC)-0.5? 

Solution:	 The  solution  to  3.1A  said  the  conducting  caps  of  the  resistor  have  area  A  =  πr2  = 
π(2.5×10-4)2,  and  the  length  of  the  dielectric  d  is  1 mm.   The  permittivity  ε  =  4εo,  so 
the  capacitance  (3.1.10)  is  C  =  εA/d  =  4×8.85×10-12×π(2.5×10-4)2/10-3  ≅  7×10-15 
farads.  The  inductance L  of  this  device would  probably  be  dominated  by  that  of  the 
connecting  wires  because  their  diameters  would  be  smaller  and  their  length  longer. 
Assume  the  wire  length  is  D  =  4d  =  4×10-3,  and  its  radius  r  is  10-4.  Then  (3.3.17) 
(1.26×10-6

yields  L

3.7×10-10  [Hy].  The  critical  frequencies  R/L,  (RC)-1,  and  (LC)-0.5  are  2.7×1011, 
6.2×1011,  and  1.4×1012  [r  s-1],  respectively,  so  the  maximum  frequency  for  which 
reasonably pure resistance is obtained is ~10 GHz (~R/2πL4). 

3.4  General circuits and solution methods 

3.4.1  Kirchoff’s laws 

Circuits  are  generally  composed  of  lumped  elements  or  “branches”  connected  at  nodes  to  form 
two- or three-dimensional structures, as suggested in Figure 3.4.1.  They can be characterized by 
the voltages vi at each node or across each branch, or by the currents ij flowing in each branch or 
in  a  set  of  current  loops.  To  determine  the  behavior  of  such  circuits  we  develop  simultaneous 
linear  equations  that  must  be  satisfied  by  the  unknown  voltages  and  currents.    Kirchoff’s  laws 
generally provide these equations. 

Although circuit analysis  is often based  in part on Kirchoff’s  laws,  these  laws are  imperfect 
due to electromagnetic effects.   For example, Kirchoff’s voltage  law (KVL) says  that  the voltage 
drops vi associated with each lumped element around any loop must sum to zero, i.e.: 
∑ vi

C 
A 

 

(3.4.2)

This  integral  of  E • ds   across  any  branch  yields  the  voltage  across  that  branch.    Therefore  the 
sum  of  branch  voltages  around  any  closed  contour  is  zero  if  the  net  magnetic  flux  through  that 
contour is constant; this is the basic assumption of KVL. 

KVL  is  clearly  valid  for  any  static  circuit.    However,  any  branch  carrying  time  varying 
current will contribute time varying magnetic flux and therefore voltage to all adjacent loops plus 
others nearby.  These voltage contributions are typically negligible because the currents and loop 
areas are  small  relative  to  the wavelengths of  interest  (λ = c/f) and  the KVL approximation  then 
applies.  A standard approach to analyzing circuits that violate KVL is to determine the magnetic 
energy  or  inductance  associated with  any  extraneous magnetic  fields,  and  to model  their  effects 
in the circuit with a lumped parasitic inductance in each affected current loop. 

The companion relation to KVL is Kirchoff’s current law (KCL), which says that the sum of 
the currents ij flowing into any node is zero: 
∑ i j  = 0 
j

(Kirchoff’s current law) 

(3.4.3) 

This  follows  from  conservation  of  charge  (2.4.19)  when  no  charge  storage  on  the  nodes  is 
allowed:

For  static  problems,  KCL  is  exact.    However,  the  physical  nodes  and  the  wires  connecting 
those  nodes  to  lumped  elements  typically  exhibit  varying  voltages  and  D ,  and  therefore  have

capacitance  and  the  ability  to  store  charge,  violating KCL.    If  the  frequency  is  sufficiently  high 
that such parasitic capacitance at any node becomes  important,  that parasitic capacitance can be 
modeled as an additional lumped element attached to that node. 

3.4.2 

Solving circuit problems 

To  determine  the  behavior  of  any  given  linear  lumped  element  circuit  a  set  of  simultaneous 
equations  must  be  solved,  where  the  number  of  equations  must  equal  or  exceed  the  number  of 
unknowns.  The unknowns are generally  the voltages and currents on each branch;  if  there are b 
branches there are 2b unknowns. 

Figure  3.4.2(a)  illustrates  a  simple  circuit  with  b  =  12  branches,  p  =  6  loops,  and  n  =  7 
nodes.  A  set  of  loop  currents  uniquely  characterizes  all  currents  if  each  loop  circles  only  one 
“hole”  in  the  topology  and  if  no  additional  loops  are  added  once  every  branch  in  the  circuit  is 
incorporated in at least one loop.  Although other definitions for the loop currents can adequately 
characterize  all  branch  currents,  they  are  not  explored  here.    Figure  3.4.2(b)  illustrates  a  bridge 
circuit with b = 6, p = 3, and n = 4.

As  we  add  either  nodes  or  branches  to  the  illustrated  circuit  in  any  sequence  and  with  any 
placement, Equation (3.4.5) is always obeyed.  If we add voltage or current sources to the circuit, 
they too become branches. 

The voltage  and  current  for  each branch  are  initially unknown  and  therefore  any  circuit has 
2b  unknowns.  The  number  of  equations  is  also  b  +  (n  –  1)  +  p  =  2b,  where  the  first  b  in  this 
expression  corresponds  to  the  equations  relating  voltage  to  current  in  each  branch,  n-1  is  the 
number of independent KCL equations, and p is the number of loops and KVL equations; (3.4.5) 
says  (n – 1) + p = b.  Therefore, since  the numbers of unknowns and  linear equations match, we 
may  solve  them.    The  equations  are  linear  because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear  for  RLC 
circuits. 

Often  circuits  are  so  complex  that  it  is  convenient  for  purposes  of  analysis  to  replace  large 
sections  of  them  with  either  a  two-terminal  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  or  Norton  equivalent 
circuit.  This  can  be  done  only when  that  circuit  is  incrementally  linear with  respect  to  voltages 
imposed at its terminals.  Thevenin equivalent circuits consist of a voltage source VTh(t) in series 
with a passive  linear circuit characterized by  its frequency-dependent  impedance Z(ω) = R +  jΧ, 
while Norton  equivalent  circuits  consist  of  a  current  source  INo(t)  in  parallel with  an  impedance 
Z(ω). 

An  important  example  of  the  utility  of  equivalent  circuits  is  the  problem  of  designing  a 
matched  load  ZL(ω)  =  RL(ω)  +  jXL(ω)  that  accepts  the  maximum  amount  of  power  available 
from  a  linear  source  circuit,  and  reflects  none.  The  solution  is  simply  to  design  the  load  so  its 
impedance

load cancels that of the source [XL(ω) = - X(ω)] and the two resistive parts are set equal, R = RL. 

One  proof  that  a  matched  load  maximizes  power  transfer  consists  of  computing  the  time-
average  power  Pd  dissipated  in  the  load  as  a  function  of  its  impedance,  equating  to  zero  its 
derivative  dPd/dω,  and  solving  the  resulting  complex  equation  for  RL  and  XL.  We  exclude  the 
possibility  of  negative  resistances  here  unless  those  of  the  load  and  source  have  the  same  sign; 
otherwise the transferred power can be infinite if RL = -R. 

Example 3.4A 
The  bridge  circuit  of  Figure  3.4.2(b)  has  five  branches  connecting  four  nodes  in  every  possible 
way  except  one.  Assume  both  parallel  branches  have  0.1-ohm  and  0.2-ohm  resistors  in  series, 
but  in  reverse  order  so  that  R1  =  R4  =  0.1,  and  R2  =  R3  =  0.2.   What  is  the  resistance  R  of  the 
bridge  circuit  between  nodes  a  and  d  if  R5  =  0?   What  is  R  if  R5  =  ∞?  What  is  R  if  R5  is  0.5 
ohms? 

Solution:  When  R5  =  0  then  the  node  voltages  vb  =  vc,  so  R1  and  R3  are  connected  in  parallel 
and  have  the  equivalent  resistance  R13//.  Kirchoff’s  current  law  “KCL”  (3.4.3)  says 
-1  + R3
-1).  If Vab  ≡  (va  -  vb),  then 
the  current  flowing  into  node  “a”  is  I  =  (va  -  vb)(R1
-1)-1 =  (10+5)-1 = 0.067Ω = R24//.  These  two circuits 
-1 + R3
Vab =  IR13// and R13// =  (R1
are in series so their resistances add: R = R13// + R24//  ≅ 0.133 ohms.  When R5 = ∞, R1

and R2 are in series with a total resistance R12s of 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3Ω = R34s.  These two 
-1)-1 = 0.15Ω.  When R5 
-1 + R34s 
resistances, R12s  and R34s  are  in parallel,  so R =  (R12s
is  finite,  then  simultaneous  equations  must  be  solved.    For  example,  the  currents 
flowing  into  each  of  nodes  a,  b,  and  c  sum  to  zero,  yielding  three  simultaneous 
equations  that  can  be  solved  for  the  vector  V = [ v   , v   , v   ] ;  we  define  vd  =  0.  Thus
a

-1 + R3
-1) - vbR1
-1 -vcR3
-1 = 15va - 10vb - 5vc.  KCL 
(va - vb)/R1 + (va - vc)/R3 = I = va(R1
for nodes b and c similarly yield: -10va + 17vb - 2vc = 0, and -5va  -2vb + 17vc = 0.  If 
we define the current vector  I  = [I, 0, 0], then these three equations can be written as 
a matrix equation: 

⎡ 15  −10  −5⎤ 
⎢−10
⎥ . 
G v  = I , where  G = ⎢

⎣
⎦ 

 

Since  the  desired  circuit  resistance  between  nodes  a  and  d  is  R  =  va/I,  we  need  only 
−1 
solve  for  va  in  terms  of  I,  which  follows  from  = 
I
v G 
,  provided  the  conductance 
matrix G is  not  singular  (here  it  is  not).    Thus  R  =  0.146Ω,  which  is  intermediate 
between the first two solutions, as it should be.

Two-element circuits and RLC resonators 

3.5.1  Two-element circuits and uncoupled RLC resonators 

RLC  resonators  typically consist of a  resistor R,  inductor L, and capacitor C connected  in  series 
or  parallel,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  3.5.1.    RLC  resonators  are  of  interest  because  they  behave 
much  like  other  electromagnetic  systems  that  store  both  electric  and  magnetic  energy,  which 
slowly  dissipates  due  to  resistive  losses.    First we  shall  find  and  solve  the  differential  equations 
that  characterize RLC  resonators  and  their  simpler  sub-systems: RC, RL,  and LC  circuits.   This 
will  lead  to  definitions  of  resonant  frequency  ωo  and  Q,  which  will  then  be  related  in  Section 
3.5.2 to the frequency response of RLC resonators that are coupled to circuits.

Kirchoff’s  voltage  law  applied  to  the  series  RLC  circuit  of  Figure  3.5.1(a)  says  that  the  sum  of 
the voltages (3.5.1), (3.5.2), and (3.5.3) is zero: 

(3.5.3) 

 

d 2i  dt 2 + ( R L  di dt + (1 LC  i ) = 0 
) 

(3.5.4) 

where we  have  divided  by  L  and  differentiated  to  simplify  the  equation.   Before  solving  it,  it  is 
useful  to  solve  simpler  versions  for  RC,  RL,  and  LC  circuits, where we  ignore  one  of  the  three 
elements. 

In the RC limit where L = 0 we add (3.5.1) and (3.5.3) to yield the differential equation: 

di dt + (1 RC  i 
) = 0 

(3.5.5) 

This says that i(t) can be any function with the property that the first derivative is the same as the 
original signal,  times a constant.   This property  is restricted  to exponentials and  their sums, such 
as sines and cosines.  Let's represent i(t) by Ioest, where:

(RC current response) 

(3.5.9)

where τ equals RC seconds and is the RC time constant.  Io is chosen to satisfy initial conditions, 
which were not given here. 

A simple example  illustrates how  initial conditions can be  incorporated  in  the solution.   We 
simply need as many equations  for  t = 0 as  there are unknown variables.    In  the present case we 
need one equation to determine Io.  Suppose the RC circuit [of Figure 3.5.1(a) with L = 0] was at

rest at t = 0, but the capacitor was charged to Vo volts.  Then we know that the initial current Io at 
t = 0 must be Vo/R. 

In the RL limit where C = ∞ we add (3.5.1) and (3.5.2) to yield di/dt + (R/L)i = 0, which has 
the same form of solution (3.5.6), so that s = -R/L and:

2d i  dt 2 + (1 LC i  
) = 0 

(3.5.11) 

Its  solution  also  has  the  form  (3.5.6).    Because  i(t)  is  real  and  ejωt  is  complex,  it  is  easier  to 
assume sinusoidal  solutions, where  the phase φ and magnitude  Io would be determined by  initial 
conditions.  This form of the solution would be:

(3.5.19) 

Figure  3.5.2  illustrates  how  the  current  and  energy  storage  decays  exponentially  with  time 
while undergoing conversion between electric and magnetic energy storage at 2ω radians s-1; the 
time constant for current and voltage is τ = 2L/R seconds, and that for energy is L/R. 

One useful way to characterize a resonance is by the dimensionless quantity Q, which is the 
number  of  radians  required  before  the  total  energy  wT  decays  to  1/e  of  its  original  value,  as 
illustrated in Figure 3.5.2(b).  That is: 

w T  = w To

The decay rate α for current and voltage is therefore simply related to Q:

If  we  find  the  power  dissipated  Pd  [W]  by  differentiating  total  energy  wT  with  respect  to  time

electrical  experiment  performed  at  the  terminals  can  distinguish  ideal  linear  circuits  from  their

An  important  characteristic  of  a  resonator  is  the  frequency  dependence  of  its  power 
dissipation.  If RTh = 0, the series RLC resonator of Figure 3.5.3(a) dissipates:

resonance,  Pd  eventually  approaches  zero  because  the  impedances  of  L  and  C  approach  infinity 
at  infinite  and  zero  frequency,  respectively.    The  total  frequency  response  Pd(f)  of  this  series 
RLC  resonator  is  suggested  in Figure  3.5.4.  The  resonator bandwidth  or  half-power  bandwidth 
Δω  is  said  to  be  the  difference  between  the  two  half-power  frequencies,  or  Δω ≅ 2α =  R/L  for 
this  series  circuit.    Δω  is  simply  related  to  ωo  and  Q  for  both  series  and  parallel  resonances,  as 
follows from (3.5.21):

Figure 3.5.4  RLC power dissipation near resonance. 
 

Resonators  reduce  to  their  resistors  at  resonance  because  the  impedance  of  the  LC  portion 
approaches  zero  or  infinity  for  series  or  parallel  resonators,  respectively.    At  resonance  Pd  is 
maximized  when  the  source  Rs  and  load  R  resistances  match,  as  is  easily  shown  by  setting  the 
derivative  dPd/dR =  0  and  solving  for R.    In  this  case we  say  the  resonator  is  critically matched 
to its source, for all available power is then transferred to the load at resonance. 

This  critically matched  condition  can  also  be  related  to  the Q’s  of  a  coupled  resonator with 
zero Thevenin voltage applied from outside, where we define internal Q (or QI) as corresponding 
to  power  dissipated  internally  in  the  resonator,  external  Q  (or  QE)  as  corresponding  to  power 
dissipated externally  in  the source  resistance, and  loaded Q  (or QL) as corresponding  to  the  total 
power dissipated both internally (PDI) and externally (PDE).  That is, following (3.5.23): 

QI  ≡ ωwT  PDI

 

QE  ≡ ωwT  PDE

 

 

 

QL  ≡ ωw T  ( PDI  + PDE )  

Therefore these Q’s are simply related:

Since  the  source  and  load  resistances  are  matched  for  maximum  power  dissipation  at 
resonance,  it  follows  from Figure 3.5.3  that  a  critically  coupled  resonator or matched  resonator 
results  when  QI  =  QE.  These  expressions  for  Q  are  in  terms  of  energies  stored  and  power 
dissipated,  and  can  readily  be  applied  to  electromagnetic  resonances  of  cavities  or  other 
structures,  yielding  their  bandwidths  and  conditions  for  maximum  power  transfer  to  loads,  as 
discussed in Section 9.4.
