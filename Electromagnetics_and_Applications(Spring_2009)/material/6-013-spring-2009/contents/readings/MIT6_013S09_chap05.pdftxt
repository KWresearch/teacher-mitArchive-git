Forces on free charges and currents 

5.1.1  Lorentz force equation and introduction to force 

The  Lorentz  force  equation  (1.2.1)  fully  characterizes  electromagnetic  forces  on  stationary  and 
moving charges.  Despite the simplicity of this equation, it is highly accurate and essential to the 
understanding  of  all  electrical  phenomena  because  these  phenomena  are  observable  only  as  a 
result  of  forces  on  charges.  Sometimes  these  forces  drive  motors  or  other  actuators,  and 
sometimes  they  drive  electrons  through  materials  that  are  heated,  illuminated,  or  undergoing 
other  physical  or  chemical  changes.    These  forces  also  drive  the  currents  essential  to  all 
electronic circuits and devices. 

When  the electromagnetic fields and  the  location and motion of free charges are known,  the 
calculation  of  the  forces  acting  on  those  charges  is  straightforward  and  is  explained  in  Sections 
5.1.2  and  5.1.3.  When  these  charges  and  currents  are  confined  within  conductors  instead  of 
being isolated in vacuum, the approaches introduced in Section 5.2 can usually be used.  Finally, 
when  the  charges  and  charge  motion  of  interest  are  bound  within  stationary  atoms  or  spinning 
charged  particles,  the Kelvin  force  density  expressions  developed  in Section  5.3 must  be  added. 
The problem usually lies beyond the scope of this text when the force-producing electromagnetic 
fields  are  not  given  but  are  determined  by  those  same  charges  on  which  the  forces  are  acting 
(e.g., plasma physics), and when the velocities are relativistic. 

The  simplest  case  involves  the  forces  arising  from  known  electromagnetic  fields  acting  on 
free charges in vacuum.  This case can be treated using the Lorentz force equation (5.1.1) for the 
force vector  f  acting on a charge q [Coulombs]: 

f = q ( E + v × μo H ) 

[Newtons] 

(Lorentz force equation)

(5.1.1) 

where  E  and  H  are the local electric and magnetic fields and  v  is the charge velocity vector 
[m s-1]. 

5.1.2  Electric Lorentz forces on free electrons 

The  cathode-ray  tube  (CRT)  used  for  displays  in  older  computers  and  television  sets,  as 
illustrated in Figure 5.1.1, provides a simple example of the Lorentz force law (5.1.1).  Electrons 
thermally  excited  by  a  heated  cathode  at  -V  volts  escape  at  low  energy  and  are  accelerated  in 
vacuum  at  acceleration  a   [m  s-2]  toward  the  grounded  anode  by  the  electric  field  E ≅ − zˆV
s
between  anode  and  cathode13;  V  and  s  are  the  voltage  across  the  tube  and  the  cathode-anode 

 

 

13 The anode  is grounded  for  safety  reasons;  it  lies at  the  tube  face where users may place  their  fingers on  the other 
side of the glass faceplate.  Also, the cathode and anode are sometimes shaped so that the electric field  E , the force 
f  , and the acceleration  a  are functions of z instead of being constant; i.e.,  E  ≠ − zˆV
.

The acceleration  a  is governed by Newton’s law: 

f = ma  

(Newton’s law) 

(5.1.2) 

where m  is  the mass  of  the  unconstrained  accelerating  particle.    Therefore  the  acceleration  a  of 
the electron charge q = -e in an electric field E = V/s is: 

a = f m = qE  m ≅ eV ms 

[ms-2 ]

 

(5.1.3) 

The  subsequent  velocity  v   and  position  z  of  the  particle  can  be  found  by  integration  of  the 
acceleration  z aˆ

where  we  have  defined  the  initial  electron  position  and  velocity  at  t  =  0  as  zo  and⎯vo, 
respectively. 

The increase wk in the kinetic energy of the electron equals the accumulated work done on it 
by the electric field  E .  That is, the increase in the kinetic energy of the electron is the product of 
the constant force f acting on it and the distance s the electron moved in the direction of  f  while 
experiencing that force.  If s is the separation between anode and cathode, then:

Thus  the kinetic energy acquired by  the electron  in moving  through  the potential difference V  is 
eV  Joules.  If  V  =  1  volt,  then  wk  is  one  “electron  volt”,  or  “e”  Joules,  where  e  ≅  1.6  ×  10-19 
Coulombs.  The kinetic energy increase equals eV even when  E  is a function of z because:

(5.1.7)

Typical  values  for  V  in  television  CRT’s  are  generally  less  than  50  kV  so  as  to  minimize  
dangerous  x-rays  produced  when  the  electrons  impact  the  phosphors  on  the  CRT  faceplate, 
which is often made of x-ray-absorbing leaded glass. 

Figure 5.1.1 also illustrates how time-varying lateral electric fields  E⊥ ( t ) can be applied by
deflection plates so as  to scan  the electron beam across  the CRT faceplate and “paint”  the  image 
to be displayed.  At higher  tube voltages V  the electrons move so quickly  that the lateral electric 
forces  have  no  time  to  act,  and  magnetic  deflection  is  used  instead  because  lateral  magnetic 
forces increase with electron velocity v. 

Example 5.1A 
Long  interplanetary or  interstellar voyages might eject charged particles at high speeds  to obtain 
thrust.   What  particles  are  most  efficient  at  imparting  total  momentum  if  the  rocket  has  only  E 
joules and M kg available to expend for this purpose? 

Solution:	 Particles  of  charge  e  accelerating  through  an  electric  potential  of  V  volts  acquire 
energy  eV  [J]  =  mv2/2;  such  energies  can  exceed  those  available  in  chemical 
reactions.  The  total  increase  in  rocket  momentum  =  nmv  [N],  where  n  is  the  total 
number  of  particles  ejected,  m  is  the  mass  of  each  particle,  and  v  is  their  velocity. 
The total mass and energy available on the rocket is M = nm and E = neV.  Since v = 
(2eV/m)0.5, the total momentum ejected is Mv = nmv = (n22eVm)0.5 = (2EM)0.5.  Thus 
any kind of charged particles can be ejected, only the total energy E and mass ejected 
M matter. 

5.1.3  Magnetic Lorentz forces on free charges 

An  alternate  method  for  laterally  scanning  the  electron  beam  in  a  CRT  utilizes  magnetic 
deflection  applied  by  coils  that  produce  a magnetic  field  perpendicular  to  the  electron  beam,  as 
illustrated  in  Figure  5.1.2.    The  magnetic  Lorentz  force  on  the  charge  q  =  -e  (1.6021×10-19 
Coulombs) is easily found from (5.1.1) to be: 

f  = −ev

 × μ o H 

[ N ]

(5.1.8)
 

Thus the illustrated CRT electron beam would be deflected upwards, where the magnetic field⎯H 
produced  by  the  coil  is  directed  out  of  the  paper;  the magnitude  of  the  force  on  each  electron  is 
evμoH [N].

Figure 5.1.2  Magnetic deflection of electrons in a cathode ray tube. 
 

The  lateral  force  on  the  electrons  evμoH  can  be  related  to  the  CRT  voltage  V.    Electrons 
accelerated from rest through a potential difference of V volts have kinetic energy eV [J], where: 

eV = mv2  2 

(5.1.9)
 

Therefore  the  electron  velocity  v  =  (2eV/m)0.5,  where  m  is  the  electron  mass  (9.107×10-31  kg), 
and  the  lateral  deflection  increases  with  tube  voltage  V,  whereas  it  decreases  if  electrostatic 
deflection is used instead. 

Another  case  of  magnetic  deflection  is  illustrated  in  Figure  5.1.3  where  a  free  electron 
moving  perpendicular  to  a  magnetic  field  B   experiences  a  force  f   orthogonal  to  its  velocity 
vector  v , since  f = q v × μ  o H .

This  force  f   is  always  orthogonal  to  v   and  therefore  the  trajectory  of  the  electron  will  be

which is independent of v and the electron energy, provided the electron is not relativistic.  Thus 
the  magnitudes  of  magnetic  fields  can  be  measured  by  observing  the  radiation  frequency  ωe  of 
free electrons in the region of interest. 

Example 5.1B 
What  is  the  radius  re  of  cyclotron  motion  for  a  100  e.v.  free  electron  in  the  terrestrial 
magnetosphere14  where  B  ≅ 10-6  Tesla?  What  is  the  radius  rp  for  a  free  proton  with  the  same 
energy?  The masses of electrons and protons are ~9.1×10-31 and 1.7×10-27 kg, respectively. 

Solution:  	 The magnetic force on a charged particle is qvμoH = ma = mv2/r, where the velocity v 
follows  from  (5.1.9):    eV  =  mv2/2  ⇒  v  =  (2eV/m)0.5.  Solving  for  re  yields  re  =

Forces on charges and currents within conductors 

5.2.1  Electric Lorentz forces on charges within conductors 

Static electric forces on charges within conductors can also be calculated using the Lorentz force 
equation  (5.1.1), which  becomes  f = qE .  For  example,  consider  the  capacitor  plates  illustrated 
in  Figure  5.2.1(a),  which  have  total  surface  charges  of  ±Q  coulombs  on  the  two  conductor 
surfaces facing each other.  The fields and charges for capacitor plates were discussed in Section 
3.1.3.

To compute the total attractive electric pressure Pe [N m-2] on the top plate, for example, we can 
integrate  the Lorentz  force density  F   [N m-3] acting on  the charge distribution ρ(z) over depth z 
and unit area: 

14 The magnetosphere extends from the ionosphere to several planetary radii; particle collisions are rare compared to 
the cyclotron frequency.

where we have defined  E = zˆE z , as illustrated. 

Care  is  warranted,  however,  because  surface  the  charge  ρ(z)  is  distributed  over  some 
infinitesimal  depth  δ,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.2.1(b),  and  those  charges  at  greater  depths  are 
shielded by the others and therefore see a smaller electric field  E .  If we assume ε = εo inside the 
conductors and a planar geometry with ∂/∂x = ∂/∂y = 0, then Gauss’s law,  ∇ • εE = ρ , becomes: 

εodE z  dz = ρ(z) 

 

(5.2.3)
 

This  expression  for  ρ(z)  can  be  substituted  into  (5.2.2)  to  yield  the  pressure  exerted  by  the 
electric fields on the capacitor plate and perpendicular to it:

The charge density ρ and electric field Ez are zero at  levels below δ, and  the field strength at  the 
surface  is Eo.  If  the  conductor were  a  dielectric with  ε ≠ εo,  then  the Kelvin  polarization  forces 
discussed in Section 5.3.2 would also have to be considered. 

Thus  the  electric  pressure  Pe  [N  m-2]  pulling  on  a  charged  conductor  is  the  same  as  the 
immediately  adjacent  electric  energy  density  [Jm-3],  and  is  independent  of  the  sign  of  ρ  and  E . 
These  dimensions  are  identical  because  [J]  =  [Nm].    The  maximum  achievable  electric  field 
strength  thus  limits  the  maximum  achievable  electric  pressure  Pe,  which  is  negative  because  it 
pulls rather than pushes conductors.

(5.2.5) 

where ρs is the surface charge density [cm-2] on the conductor and εo is its permittivity; boundary 
conditions  at  the  conductor  require D =  εoE = σs.  Therefore  if  the  conductor were  adjacent  to  a 
dielectric  slab with  ε ≠ εo,  the  electrical  pressure  on  the  conductor would  still  be  determined  by 
the  surface  charge,  electric  field,  and  permittivity  εo within  the  conductor;  the  pressure  does  not 
otherwise depend on ε of adjacent rigid materials. 

We  can  infer  from  (5.2.4)  the  intuitively  useful  result  that  the  average  electric  field  pulling 
on the charge Q is E/2 since the total pulling force f = - PeA, where A is the area of the plate:

(5.2.6)

If  the  two  plates  were  both  charged  the  same  instead  of  oppositely,  the  surface  charges 
would  repel  each  other  and move  to  the  outer  surfaces  of  the  two  plates,  away  from  each  other. 
Since  there  would  now  be  no  E  between  the  plates,  it  could  apply  no  force.    However,  the 
charges  Q  on  the  outside  are  associated  with  the  same  electric  field  strength  as  before,  E  = 
Q/εoA.  These  electric  fields  outside  the  plates  therefore  pull  them  apart  with  the  same  force 
density as before, Pe =  - εoE2/2, and  the force between  the  two plates  is now  repulsive  instead of 
attractive.  In both the attractive and repulsive cases we have assumed the plate width and length 
are sufficiently large compared to the plate separation that fringing fields can be neglected. 

Example 5.2A 
Some  copy machines  leave  the  paper  electrically  charged.   What  is  the  electric  field  E  between 
two  adjacent  sheets of paper  if  they  cling  together  electrically with  a  force density of 0.01 oz. ≅ 
0.0025 N per square centimeter = 25 Nm-2?  If we slightly separate two such sheets of paper by 4 
cm, what is the voltage V between them? 

Solution:	 Electric pressure is Pe = -εoE2/2 [N m-2], so E = (-2P

[MV/m].   At  4  cm  distance  this  field  yields  ~95  kV  potential  difference  between  the 
sheets.  The tiny charge involved renders this voltage harmless. 

5.2.2  Magnetic Lorentz forces on currents in conductors 

The Lorentz force law can also be used to compute forces on electrons moving within conductors 
for which μ = μo.  Computation of forces for  the case μ ≠ μo  is  treated  in Sections 5.3.3 and 5.4. 
If there is no net charge and no current flowing in a wire, the forces on the positive and negative 
charges all cancel because the charges comprising matter are bound together by strong inter- and 
intra-atomic forces.

We can easily extend the result of (5.2.7) to the case of two parallel wires carrying the same

(5.2.9)
 

The  simplicity  of  this  equation  and  the  ease  of measurement  of  F,  I,  and  r  led  to  its  use  in 
defining the permeability of free space, μo = 4π×10-7 Henries/meter, and hence the definition of a 
Henry (the unit of  inductance).   If the  two currents are  in opposite directions,  the force acting on 
the wires is repulsive.  For example, if I = 10 amperes and r = 2 millimeters, then (5.2.9) yields F 
=  4π×10-7  ×  102/2π2×10-3  =  0.01  Newtons/meter;  this  is  approximately  the  average  repulsive 
force  between  the  two wires  in  a  120-volt AC  lamp  cord  delivering  one  kilowatt.    These  forces 
are  attractive  when  the  currents  are  parallel,  so  if  we  consider  a  single  wire  as  consisting  of

respectively.

parallel  strands,  they  will  squeeze  together  due  to  this  pinch  effect.    At  extreme  currents,  these 
forces  can  actually  crush  wires,  so  the  maximum  achievable  instantaneous  current  density  in 
wires  is  partly  limited  by  their mechanical  strength.    The  same  effect  can  pinch  electron  beams 
flowing in charge-neutral plasmas. 

The  magnetic  fields  associated  with  surface  currents  on  flat  conductors  generally  exert  a 
pressure  P  [N m-2] that is simply related to the instantaneous field strength  Hs  at the conductor 
surface.  First we can use the magnetic term in the Lorentz force law (5.2.7) to compute the force

where  n  is  the  number  of  charges  q  per  cubic meter.   To  find  the magnetic  pressure  Pm  [N m-2] 
on  the  conductor  we  must  integrate  the  force  density⎯F  over  depth  z,  where  both  J   and  H are  
functions of z, as governed by Ampere’s law in the static limit: 

∇ × H = J

If we assume  H = yˆH

then  J is in the x direction and ∂Hy/∂x = 0, so that:

Forces on bound charges within materials 

5.3.1 

Introduction 

Forces  on  materials  can  be  calculated  in  three  different  ways:  1)  via  the  Lorentz  force  law,  as 
illustrated  in  Section  5.2  for  free  charges within materials,  2)  via  energy methods,  as  illustrated 
in  Section  5.4,  and  3)  via  photonic  forces,  as  discussed  in  Section  5.6.    When  polarized  or 
magnetized materials are present, as discussed here in Section 5.3, the Lorentz force law must be 
applied  not  only  to  the  free  charges  within  the  materials,  i.e.  the  surface  charges  and  currents 
discussed  earlier,  but  also  to  the  orbiting  and  spinning  charges  bound  within  atoms.   When  the 
Lorenz force equation is applied to these bound charges, the result is the Kelvin polarization and 
magnetization force densities.  Under the paradigm developed in this chapter these Kelvin forces 
must  be  added  to  the  Lorentz  forces  on  the  free  charges16.  The  Kelvin  force  densities  are  non­
zero  only  when  inhomogeneous  fields  are  present,  as  discussed  below  in  Sections  5.3.2  and 
5.3.3.  But  before  discussing  Kelvin  forces  it  is  useful  to  review  the  relationship  between  the 
Lorentz force law and matter. 

The Lorentz  force  law  is  complete  and  exact  if we  ignore  relativistic  issues  associated with 
either  extremely  high  velocities  or  field  strengths;  neither  circumstance  is  relevant  to  current 
commercial  products.  To  compute  all  the  Lorentz  forces  on  matter  we  must  recognize  that 
classical  matter  is  composed  of  atoms  comprised  of  positive  and  negative  charges,  some  of 
which  are moving  and  exhibit magnetic moments  due  to  their  spin  or  orbital motions.   Because 
these  charges  are  trapped  in  the  matter,  any  forces  on  them  are  transferred  to  that  matter,  as 
assumed  in Section 5.2  for electric  forces on  surface  charges  and  for magnetic  forces on  surface 
currents. 

When  applying  the  Lorentz  force  law  within  matter  under  our  paradigm  it  is  important  to 
use the expression: 

f  = q ( E + v × μ

)   [
]
o H  Newtons 
 

(5.3.1) 

without substituting  μH  for the last term when μ ≠ μo.  A simple example illustrates the dangers 
of  this  common  notational  shortcut.    Consider  the  instantaneous  magnetic  pressure  (5.2.13) 
derived using  the Lorentz force  law for a uniform plane wave normally incident on a conducting 
plate  having  μ ≠ μo.  The  same  force  is  also  found  later  in  (5.6.5)  using  photon momentum.    If 
we incorrectly use: 

f  = q ( E + v × μH )

(incorrect for this example) 

(5.3.2) 

16 The division here between Lorentz  forces  acting on  free  charges  and  the Lorentz  forces  acting on bound  charges 
(often  called  Kelvin  forces)  is  complete  and  accurate,  but  not  unique,  for  these  forces  can  be  grouped  and  labeled 
differently, leading to slightly different expressions that are also correct.

because  v   occurs  within  μ ,  then  the  computed  wave  pressure  would  increase  with  μ,  whereas 
the  photon  model  has  no  such  dependence  and  yields  Pm  = μoH 2  2 ,  the  same  answer  as  does 
(5.2.13).  The  photon  model  depends  purely  on  the  input  and  output  photon  momentum  fluxes 
observed  some  distance  from  the  mirror,  and  thus  the  details  of  the  mirror  construction  are 
irrelevant once the fraction of photons reflected is known. 

This  independence  of  the  Lorentz  force  from  μ  can  also  be  seen  directly  from  the  Lorentz 
force  calculation  that  led  to  (5.2.13).    In  this  case  the  total  surface  current  is  not  a  function  of μ 
for  a  perfect  reflector,  and  neither  is  H   just  below  the  surface;  they  depend  only  upon  the 
incident  wave  and  the  fact  that  the  mirror  is  nearly  perfect.  H   does  decay  faster  with  depth 
when  μ  is  large,  as  discussed  in  Section  9.3,  but  the  average  H   experienced  by  the  surface-
current  electrons  is  still  half  the  value  of  H   at  the  surface,  so  f   is  unchanged  as  μ varies.  The 
form  of  the  Lorentz  force  law  presented  in  (5.3.2)  can  therefore  be  safely  used  under  our  force 
paradigm only when μ = μo, although the magnetic term is often written as  v B .× 

There  are  alternate  correct  paradigms  that  use  μ  in  the  Lorentz  law  rather  than  μo,  but  they 
interpret  Maxwell’s  equations  slightly  differently.    These  alternative  approaches  are  not 
discussed here. 

The  Lorentz  force  law  can  also  be  applied  to  those  cases where  non-uniform  fields  pull  on 
dielectrics or permeable materials, as suggested by Figure 5.3.1.   These problems are often more 
easily  solved,  however,  using  energy  (Section  5.4)  or  pressure  (Section  5.5)  methods.    To 
compute  in  general  the  forces  on  matter  exerted  by  non-uniform  electric  or  magnetic  fields  we 
can derive  the Kelvin polarization and magnetization force density expressions  from  the Lorentz 
equation, as shown in Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, respectively.

The  derivations  of  the  Kelvin  force  density  expressions  are  based  on  the  following  simple 
models  for  charges  in matter.    Electric  Lorentz  forces  act  on  atomic  nuclei  and  the  surrounding 
electron clouds that are bound together, and on any free charges.  The effect of⎯E on positive and 
negative  charges  bound  within  an  atom  is  to  displace  their  centers  slightly,  inducing  a  small 
electric dipole.  The resulting atomic electric dipole moment is: 

- 137 -


p d= q  

(Coulomb meters) 

(5.3.3) 

where  d   is  the displacement vector  [m] pointing  from  the negative  charge  center  to  the positive 
charge center  for each atom, and q  is  the atomic charge or atomic number.   As discussed  further 
in Section 5.3.2, Kelvin polarization forces result when the field gradients cause the electric field 
lines to curve slightly so that the directions of the electric Lorentz forces are slightly different for 
the  two  ends  of  the  field-induced  electric  dipoles  so  they  do  not  cancel  exactly,  leaving  a  net 
residual force. 

The  magnetic  Lorentz  forces  act  on  electrons  classically  orbiting  atomic  nuclei  with 
velocities  v , and act on electrons with classical charge densities spinning at velocity  v  about the 
electron  spin axis.   Protons also  spin, and  therefore both electrons and protons possess magnetic 
dipole moments; these spin moments are smaller than those due to electron orbital motion.  If we 
consider  these  spin  and  orbital motions  as  being  associated with  current  loops,  then  we  can  see 
that  the net  force on such a  loop would be non-zero  if  the magnetic  fields perpendicular  to  these 
currents  were  different  on  the  two  sides  of  the  loop.    Such  differences  exist  when  the magnetic 
field has a non-zero gradient and then Kelvin magnetization forces result, as discussed in Section 
5.3.3.  The electromagnetic properties of matter are discussed further in Sections 2.5 and 9.5. 

5.3.2  Kelvin polarization force density 

Kelvin  polarization  forces  result  when  a  non-zero  electric  field  gradient  causes  the  Lorentz 
electric  forces  on  the  two  charge  centers  of  each  induced  electric  dipole  in  a  dielectric  to  differ, 
as illustrated in Figure 5.3.1(a).  The force density can be found by summing the force imbalance 
vectors for each dipole within a unit volume. 

Assume  the  center  of  the  negative  charge  -q  for  a  particular  atom  is  at  r ,  and  the  center  of 
the  positive  charge  +q  is  at  r + d .  Then  the  net  electric  Lorentz  force  on  that  atom  in  the  x 
direction is:

x  r  ⎦ = q ( d • ∇E
x  r + d ) − E ( )⎤

(5.3.4)

Thus  f x   is  the  projection  of  the  charge  offset  d   on  the  gradient  of  qEx.  We  recall 
∇ ≡ xˆ ∂/∂x + yˆ ∂/∂y + zˆ ∂/∂z. 

Equation (5.3.4) can easily be generalized to:

f  = xˆ ( qd • ∇E ) +

where  p q= d  and (5.3.6) defines the new compact notation  p • ∇ E .  Previously we have defined 
only  ∇ × E   and  ∇ • E ,  and  the  notation  p • [.]  would  have  implied  a  scalar,  not  a  vector.    Thus
the new operator defined here is [•∇], and it operates on a pair of vectors to produce a vector. 

Equation  (5.3.6)  then  yields  the  Kelvin  polarization  force  density  Fp  = n f  ,  where  n  is  the 
density of atomic dipoles [m-3], and the polarization density of the material  P  is  n p  [C m-2]:

(5.3.7)

Equation  (5.3.7)  states  that  electrically  polarized  materials  are  pulled  into  regions  having 
stronger  electric  fields  if  there  is  polarization  P   in  the  direction  of  the  gradient.  Less  obvious 
from  (5.3.7)  is  the  fact  that  there can be such a  force even when  the applied electric  field  E  and  
P   are  orthogonal  to  the  field  gradient,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.3.1(a).    In  this  example  a  z-
polarized dielectric  is drawn  in  the x direction  into  regions of stronger Ez.  This happens  in curl-
free fields because then a non-zero ∂Ez/∂x implies a non-zero ∂Ex/∂z that contributes to  Fp .  This 
relation between partial derivatives follows from the definition: 

∇ × E   = 0 = xˆ ( ∂E z  ∂y   − ∂E  y  ∂z ) + yˆ ( ∂E x  ∂z   − ∂E  z  ∂x ) + zˆ ( ∂E y  ∂x  − ∂E   x  ∂y ) 

(5.3.8)

Since  each  cartesian  component  must  equal  zero,  it  follows  that  ∂Ex/∂z  =  ∂Ez/∂x  so  both  these 
derivatives  are  non-zero,  as  claimed.   Note  that  if  the  field  lines  E  were  not  curved,  then  fx =  0 
in Figure 5.3.1.  But such fields with a gradient ∇Ez  ≠ 0 would have non-zero curl, which would 
require current to flow in the insulating region.

5.3.3  Kelvin magnetization force density 

Magnetic  dipoles  are  induced  in  permeable  materials  by  magnetic  fields.    These  induced 
magnetic  dipoles  arise  when  the  applied  magnetic  field  slightly  realigns  the  randomly  oriented 

- 139 -

pre-existing magnetic  dipoles  associated with  electron  spins  and  electron  orbits  in  atoms.    Each 
such induced magnetic dipole can be modeled as a small current loop, such as the one pictured in 
Figure 5.3.1(b)  in  the x-y plane.   The collective effect of  these  induced  atomic magnetic dipoles 
is  a  permeability  μ  that  differs  from  μo,  as  discussed  further  in  Section  2.5.4.    Prior  to 
realignment of the magnetic dipoles in a magnetizable medium by an externally applied  H , their  
orientations are generally random so that their effects cancel and can be neglected. 

Kelvin  magnetization  forces  on  materials  result  when  a  non-zero  magnetic  field  gradient 
causes the Lorentz magnetic forces on the two current centers of each induced magnetic dipole to 
differ  so  they  no  longer  cancel,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.3.1(b).    The  magnified  portion  of  the 
figure shows a typical current loop in cross-section where the magnetic Lorentz forces fx1 and fx2 
are  unbalanced  because  B1   and  B2   differ.  The  magnetic  flux  density  B1   acts  on  the  current 
flowing  in  the  -y  direction,  and  the  magnetic  field  B2   acts  on  the  equal  and  opposite  current 
flowing  in  the  +y  direction.  The  force  density  Fm   can  be  found  by  summing  the  net  force 
vectors  for  every  such  induced  magnetic  dipole  within  a  unit  volume.    This  net  force  density 
pulls a medium with μ > μo into the high-field region. 

The current loops induced in magnetic materials such as iron and nickel tend to increase the 
applied magnetic  field  H ,  as  illustrated,  so  that  the  permeable material  in  the  figure  has  μ  >  μo 
and  experiences  a  net  force  that  tends  to  move  it  toward  more  intense  magnetic  fields.    That  is 
why  magnets  attract  iron  and  any  paramagnetic  material  that  has  μ  >  μo,  while  repulsing  any 
diamagnetic material  for which  the  induced  current  loops have  the opposite polarity  so  that μ < 
μo.  Although  most  ordinary  materials  are  either  paramagnetic  or  diamagnetic  with  μ ≅ μ,  only 
ferromagnetic materials such as iron and nickel have μ >> μo and are visibly affected by ordinary 
magnets. 

An expression for  the Kelvin magnetization force density  Fm  can be derived by calculating 
the  forces  on  a  square  current  loop  of  I  amperes  in  the  x-y  plane,  as  illustrated.    The  Lorentz 
magnetic force on each of the four legs is: 

[
f i = ×I  μ 
o Hw  N

]
 

where i = 1,2,3,4, and w is the length of each leg.  The sum of these four forces is: 

f  = Iw  2μ ⎡o  ⎣( yˆ × ∂H ∂x ) − ( xˆ × ∂H ∂y )⎤⎦   [N]

=H 0 , while ∂Hz/∂x = ∂Hx/∂z and 
∂Hz/∂y  =  ∂Hy/∂z  because  ∇ × H = 0   in  the  absence  of  macroscopic  currents.    Thus  for  the 
geometry  of Figure  5.3.1(b), where  m   is  in  the  z  direction,  the magnetization  force  of Equation 
(5.3.10) becomes:

Such  forces  exist  even  when  the  applied  magnetic  field  H   and  the  magnetization  M   are 
orthogonal  to  the  field  gradient,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.3.1(b).    As  in  the  case  of  Kelvin 
polarization  forces,  this  happens  in  curl-free  fields  because  then  a  non-zero  ∂Hz/∂x  implies  a 
non-zero ∂Hx/∂z that contributes to  Fm .

Forces computed using energy methods 

5.4.1  Relationship between force and energy 

Mechanics  teaches  that  a  force  f  in  the  z  direction  pushing  an  object  a  distance  dz  expends 
energy dw = f dz [J], so: 

f

d= w dz

(force/energy equation) 

(5.4.1) 

Therefore  the  net  force  fbe  applied  by  the  environment  to  any  object  in  the  z  direction  can  be 
found simply by differentiating the total system energy w with respect to motion of that object in 
the direction z.  The total force vector  f be  is the sum of its x, y, and z components. 

Care must be  taken, however,  to ensure  that  the  total  system energy  is differentiated, which 
can  include  the  energy  in  any  connected  power  supplies,  mechanical  elements,  etc.    Care  must 
also  be  taken  to  carefully  distinguish  between  forces  fbe  exerted  by  the  environment,  and  forces 
foe  exerted  by  objects  on  their  environment;  otherwise  sign  errors  are  readily  introduced.  This 
simple  powerful  approach  to  finding  forces  is  illustrated  in  Section  5.4.2  for  electrostatic  forces 
and  in Section 5.6 for photonic forces.  The energy approach  to calculating magnetic forces uses 
(5.4.1)  in a  straightforward way, but examples are postponed  to Chapter 6 when magnetic  fields 
in structures will be better understood. 

- 141 -


Example 5.4A 
A  certain  perfectly  conducting  electromagnet  carrying  one  ampere  exerts  an  attractive  100-N 
force  f  on  a  piece  of  iron while  it moves  away  from  the magnet  at  velocity  v =  1  [m  s-1].  What 
voltage V  is  induced  across  the  terminals  of  the  electromagnet  as  a  result  of  this  velocity  v?    Is 
this  voltage  V  positive  or  negative  on  that  terminal  where  the  current  enters  the  magnet?  Use 
conservation of power. 

Solution:  	 Conservation  of  power  requires  fv  =  VI,  so  V  =  fv/I  =  100×1/1  =  100  volts.  The 
voltage is negative because the magnet is acting as a generator since the motion of the 
iron is opposite to the magnetic force acting on it. 

5.4.2  Electrostatic forces on conductors and dielectrics 

The  energy  method  easily  yields  the  force  fbe  needed  to  separate  in  the  z  direction  the  two 
isolated  capacitor plates oppositely  charged with Q  in vacuum  and  illustrated  in Figure 5.2.1(a). 
Since  the plates are attracted  to one another, separating  them does work and  increases  the stored 
energy  w.  The  force  needed  to  hold  the  plates  apart  is  easily  found  using  the  force/energy 
equation (5.4.1):

(5.4.2) 

where  the  plate  separation  is  s  and  the  plate  area  is  A.    The  electric  energy  we  stored  in  a 
capacitor  C  is  CV2/2  =  Q2/2C  =  Q2s/2εA,  where  Q  =  CV  and  C  =  εA/s,  as  shown  in  Section 
3.1.3.  Here we assumed ε = εo. 

The  derivative  in  (5.4.2)  was  easy  to  evaluate  because  Q  remains  constant  as  the 
disconnected plates are forced apart.  It would be incorrect to use w = CV2/2 when differentiating 
(5.4.2)  unless  we  recognize  that  V  increases  as  the  plates  separate  because  V  =  Q/C  when  C 
decreases. 
It  is  easier  to  express  energy  in  terms  of  parameters  that  remain  constant  as  z 
changes. 

We can put (5.4.2) in the more familiar form (5.2.4) for the electric pressure Pe pushing on a 
conductor  by  noting  that  the  force  fbe  needed  to  separate  the  plates  is  the  same  as  the  electric 
force attracting the oppositely charged plates.  The force fbe thus balances the electric pressure on 
the same plates and Pe = -fbe/A.  Since Q = εoEA here we find: 

Pe  = −Q2  2εoA 2  = −ε oE 2  2 

⎣⎡ Nm

(5.4.3) 

This  static  attractive  pressure  of  electric  fields  remains  the  same  if  the  plates  are  connected 
to a battery of voltage V  instead of being  isolated;  the Lorentz forces are  the same  in both cases. 
A  more  awkward  way  to  calculate  the  same  force  (5.4.2)  is  to  assume  (unnecessarily)  that  a 
battery is connected and that V remains constant as s changes.  In this case Q must vary with dz, 
and  dQ  flows  into  the  battery,  increasing  its  energy  by  VdQ.    Since  dw  in  the  force/energy 
expression  (5.4.2)  is  the  change  in  total  system  energy,  the  changes  in  both  battery  and  electric 

- 142 -


field energy must be calculated to yield the correct energy; an example with a battery begins later 
with  (5.4.5).    As  illustrated  above,  this  complexity  can  be  avoided  by  carefully  restating  the 
problem without the source, and by expressing w in terms of electrical variables (Q here) that do 
not vary with position (s here). 

The power of  the energy method  (5.4.1)  is much more evident when calculating  the  force⎯f 
needed  to  pull  two  capacitor  plates  apart  laterally,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.4.1(a).    To  use  the 
Lorentz  force  law  directly would  require  knowledge  of  the  lateral  components  of⎯E  responsible 
for  the  lateral  forces, but  they are not  readily determined.   Since energy derivatives can often be 
computed  accurately  and  easily  (provided  the  fringing  fields  are  relatively  small),  that  is  often 
the preferred method for computing electric and magnetic forces.

The  force/energy  equation  (5.4.1)  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  area  A  =  WL  of  the

overlap L is negative, and the force exerted on the plates by the environment is:

where dz = dL and we = Q2s/2WL.  We again assumed that the plates were isolated in space so Q 
was  constant,  but  the  same  force  results when  the  plates  are  attached  to  a  battery;  in  both  cases 
the Lorentz forces arise from the very same charges so the two forces must be identical. 

For  purposes  of  illustration,  let’s  solve  the  force/energy  equation  (5.4.1)  for  the  same 
problem  of  Figure  5.4.1  the more  difficult  way  by  including  the  increase  in  battery  energy  as  z 
increases.  The incremental work fbedz involved in pulling the plates apart a distance dz is:

because  the  overlap  distance  L  decreases  as  z  increases,  and  the  second  negative  sign  arises 
because the battery energy increases as Q decreases.

would  obviously  be  increased  by  a  factor  of  ε/εo  so  that  in  this  case  the  lateral  force  fbe  would

Electric and magnetic pressure 

5.5.1  Electromagnetic pressures acting on conductors 

Forces on materials can be computed in several different ways, all of which can be derived using 
Maxwell’s  equations  and  the  Lorentz  force  law.    The  pressure  method  for  computing  forces 
arising  from  static  fields  is  useful  because  it  expresses  prior  results  in  ways  that  are  easy  to 
evaluate  and  remember,  and  that  have  physical  significance.    The method  simply  notes  that  the 
electromagnetic force density (pressure) acting on the interface between two materials equals the 
difference in the electromagnetic energy densities on the two sides of the interface.  Both energy 
density [J m-3] and pressure [N m-2] have identical units because [J] = [N m]. 

For  example,  both  the Lorentz  force  law  and  the  energy method  yield  the  same  expression, 
(5.2.4) and (5.4.3) respectively, for the electric pressure Pe due to a static electric field E pushing 
on a conductor: 

Pe  = −ε oE 2  2   N

The Lorentz  force  law yields a  similar expression  (5.2.13)  for  the magnetic pressure pushing on 
a conductor:

(5.5.2) 

Thus motor  and  actuator  forces  are  limited  principally  by  the  ability  of material  systems  to 
sustain  large  static  fields without breaking down  in  some way.   Because  large magnetic  systems 
can  sustain  larger  energy  densities  than  comparable  systems  based  on  electric  fields,  essentially 
all large motors, generators, and actuators are magnetic.  Only for devices with gaps on the order 
of  a  micron  or  less  is  the  electrical  breakdown  field  strength  sufficiently  high  that  electrostatic 
and magnetic motors compete more evenly with respect to power density, as discussed in Section 
6.2.5. 

5.5.2  Electromagnetic pressures acting on permeable and dielectric media 

The Kelvin polarization  and magnetization  force densities,  (5.3.7)  and  (5.3.13)  respectively,  can 
also  be  expressed  in  terms  of  energy  densities  and  pressures.    First  we  recall  that 
D = εE = εo  E + P ,  so  P = ε( − εo ) E .  Then  it  follows  from  (5.3.7)  that  the  Kelvin  polarization 
force density is:

The  special  operator  [•∇]  is  defined  in  (5.3.6)  and  explained  in  (5.5.4).    The  x  component  of 
force density for a curl-free electric field⎯E is:

In obtaining (5.5.5) we have used (5.3.8) for a curl-free electric field, for which ∂Ex/∂y = ∂Ey/∂x 
and ∂Ex/∂z = ∂Ez/∂x. 

Equations  similar  to  (5.5.6) can be derived  for  the y and z components of  the  force density, 
which then add:

A  similar  derivation  applies  to  the  Kelvin  magnetization  force  density  Fm  .  We  begin  by 
recalling  B = μo M • ∇H ,  so  M = μ⎡⎣(  μo )  − 1 H  Then  it  follows  from  (5.3.13)  that  the  Kelvin

(5.5.9)

Note that these force density expressions depend only on the field magnitudes  E and  H , not on 
field directions. 

Two  examples  treated  in  Chapter  6  using  energy  methods  suggest  the  utility  of  simple 
pressure  equations.  Figure  6.2.4  shows  a  parallel-plate  capacitor  with  a  dielectric  slab  that  fits 
snugly between  the plates but  that is only partially  inserted  in  the z direction a distance D  that  is 
much  less  than  the  length L of both  the slab and  the capacitor plates.   The electric  field between 
the plates  is  E , both  inside and outside  the dielectric  slab.   The  total  force on  the dielectric  slab 
is  the  integral  of  the  Kelvin  polarization  force  density  (5.5.7)  over  the  volume  V  of  the  slab, 
where V = LA and A is the area of the endface of the slab.  We find from (5.5.7) that  Fp  is in the 
zˆ  direction and is non-zero only near the end of the capacitor plates where z = 0:

The integral is evaluated between the limit z = 0 where E ≅ 0 outside the capacitor plates, and the 
maximum  value  z  =  D  where  the  electric  field  between  the  plates  is  E .   Thus  the  pressure 
method yields the total force fz on the dielectric slab; it is the area A of the end of the slab, times 
2
the  electric  pressure  (ε − εo ) E 2  [N  m-2]  at  the  end  of  the  slab  that  is  pulling  the  slab  further 
between  the plates.  This pressure  is zero at  the other end of  the  slab because  E ≅ 0   there.  This
pressure is the same as will be found in (6.2.21) using energy methods. 

The second example is illustrated in Figure 6.4.1, where a snugly fitting cylindrical iron slug 
of area A has been pulled a distance D into a solenoidal coil that produces an axial magnetic field 
H.  As  in  the  case  of  the  dielectric  slab,  one  end  of  the  slug  protrudes  sufficiently  far  from  the 
coil  that H at  that end  is approximately zero.   The  force pulling on  the  slug  is easily  found  from 
(5.5.9):

(5.5.11) 

This  is more  exact  than  the  answer  found  in  (6.4.10), where  the μo  term was omitted  in  (6.4.10) 
when the energy stored in the air was neglected.

To  summarize,  the  static  electromagnetic  pressure  [N  m-2]  acting  on  a  material  interface 
with  either  free  space  or  mobile  liquids  or  gases  is  the  difference  between  the  two 
electromagnetic energy densities [J m-3] on either side of that interface, provided that the relevant 
E  and  H  are curl-free.  In  the case of dielectric or magnetic media,  the pressure on  the material 
is  directed  away  from  the  greater  energy  density.    In  the  case  of  conductors,  external  magnetic 
fields  press  on  them while  electric  fields  pull;  the  energy  density  inside  the  conductor  is  zero  in 
both cases because  E  and  H  are presumed to be zero there. 

Note  that  the  pressure  method  for  calculating  forces  on  interfaces  is  numerically  correct 
even  when  the  true  physical  locus  of  the  force  may  lie  elsewhere.    For  example,  the  Kelvin 
polarization forces for a dielectric slab being pulled  into a capacitor are concentrated at  the edge 
of  the capacitor plates at z = 0  in Figure 6.2.4, which  is physically correct, whereas  the pressure 
method  implies  incorrectly  that  the  force on  the  slab  is concentrated at  its end between  the plate 
where z = D.  The energy method does not address this issue. 

Example 5.5A 
At what  radius  r  from  a  1-MV  high  voltage  line  does  the  electric  force  acting  on  a  dust  particle 
3
having ε = 10ε
o exceed the gravitational force if its density ρ is 1 gram/cm ?  Assume the electric 
field  around  the  line  is  the  same  as  between  concentric  cylinders  having  radii  a  =  1  cm  and  b  = 
10 m. 

Solution:	 The Kelvin  polarization  force  density  (5.5.7)  can  be  integrated  over  the  volume  v  of 
the  particle  and  equated  to  the  gravitational  force  fg  =  ρvg  =  ~10-3v10  [N].  (5.5.7) 
yields  the  total  Kelvin  force:⎯fK  =  v(ε - εo)∇|⎯E  |2/2  where⎯E(r)  =  rˆ V/[r  ln(b/a)]  [V 
m-1].  ∇|⎯E  |2 = [V/ln(b/a)]2∇r  -2 = -2 rˆ [V/ln(b/a)]2r -3, where the gradient here, ∇ =  rˆ 
∂/∂r, was  computed  using  cylindrical  coordinates  (see Appendix C).    Thus  fg  =  |⎯fK  | 
becomes  10-2v  =  v9εo  [V/ln(b/a)]2r  -3,  so  r  =  {900εo[V/ln(b/a)]2}1/3  =  {900×8.85×10­
12[106/ln(1000)]2}1/3  =  5.5 meters,  independent  of  the  size  of  the  particle.    Thus  high 
voltage lines make excellent dust catchers for dielectric particles.

Photonic forces 

Photonic  forces  arise whenever  electromagnetic waves  are  absorbed or  reflected by objects,  and 
can  be  found  using  either  wave  or  photon  paradigms.    Section  5.2.2  derived  the  magnetic 
pressure  Pm   (5.2.13)  applied  by  a  surface  magnetic  field  Hs(t)  that  is  parallel  to  a  flat  perfect 
conductor in the x-y plane: 

Pm  = μ H 2
zˆ
o s

2   N⎣⎡ m
 

-2 ⎦⎤ 

(magnetic pressure on perfect conductor) 
 

(5.6.1)

Thus  this  instantaneous  magnetic  pressure  perpendicular  to  the  conductor  surface  equals  the 
adjacent magnetic energy density ([N m-2] = [J m-3]). 

In  the  sinusoidal  steady  state  the  time  average  pressure  is  half  the  peak  instantaneous  value 
given  by  (5.6.1),  where  Hs(t)  =  Hs  cos  ωt.  This  average  pressure  on  a  perfectly  reflecting 

- 147 -


conductor  can  also  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  time-average  Poynting  vector  S( t ) of  an 
incident wave characterized by H+ cos ωt: 

Pm ( t )   = μ  H 2

s ( t )   2  = 2   S( t )

⎦ 

(5.6.2)

s = 2H+ and  S( t )
where H

= ηoH 2
+ /2; the impedance of free space ηo = μo/c.

It  is  now  easy  to  relate  S( t )   to  the  photon  momentum  flux,  which  also  yields  pressure. 
We recall17 that: 

photon momentum  M = hf  c 

⎡⎣ Nm s -1 ⎤⎦ 

(5.6.3) 

The  momentum  transferred  to  a  mirror  upon  perfect  reflection  of  a  single  photon  at  normal 
incidence is therefore 2hf/c. 

We recall from mechanics that the force f required to change momentum mv is: 

f

= ( mv

 [ N ]

 

(5.6.4)

so  that  the  total  radiation  pressure  on  a  perfect  mirror  reflecting  directly  backwards  n  photons 
[s-1m-2] is: 

Pr = n 2hf

 S( t )

(radiation pressure on a mirror) 

(5.6.5) 

consistent  with  (5.6.2).  Thus  we  have  shown  that  both  the  Lorentz  force  method  and  the 
photonic  force  method  yield  the  same  pressure  on  perfectly  reflecting  mirrors;  Pm  =  Pr.  The 
factor of  two  in  (5.6.5) arises because photon momentum  is not zeroed but reversed by a mirror. 
If  these  photons  were  absorbed  rather  than  reflected,  the  rate  of  momentum  transfer  to  the 
absorber would  be  halved.  In  general  if  the  incident  and  normally  reflected  power  densities  are 
S1  and  S2  , respectively, then the average radiation pressure on the mirror is: 

P  = S1 + S2  c 

(5.6.6)
 

If  the  photons  are  incident  at  an  angle,  the momentum  transfer  is  reduced  by  the  cosine  of 
the  angle  of  incidence  and  reflection.    And  if  the mirror  is  partially  transparent,  the momentum 
transfer is reduced by that fraction of the photon momentum that passes through unaltered. 

17 A  crude  plausibility  argument  for  (5.6.3)  is  the  following.   The  energy of  a  photon  is  hf  [J],  half  being magnetic 
and half being electric.  We have seen  in  (5.2.1) and  (5.2.13)  that only  the magnetic  fields contribute  to  the Lorentz 
force on a normal reflecting conductor for which both E⊥ and H⊥ = 0, so we might notionally associate hf/2 with the 
“kinetic  energy  of  a  photon”,  where  kinetic  energy  is  linked  to  momentum.    If  photons  had  mass  m,  this  notional 
kinetic  energy  hf/2  would  equal  mc2/2,  and  the  notional  associated  momentum  mc  of  a  photon  would  then  equal 
hf/c, its actual value.

Consider the simple example of a reflective solar sail blown by radiation pressure across the 
solar system, sailing from planet to planet.  At earth the solar radiation intensity is ~1400 W/m2, 
so  (5.6.6)  yields,  for  example,  the  total  force  f  on  a  sail  of  projected  area  A  intercepting  one 
square kilometer of radiation: 

f  = A P

( 
= A2 S  t ( )  c ≤ 106 × 2 ×1400   3 ×10  ≅ 9  N	
[

]

(5.6.7) 

A  sail  this  size  one micron  thick  and  having  the  density  of water would  have  a mass m  of  1000 
kg.  Since  the  sail  velocity  v  =  at  =  (f/m)t,  where  a  is  acceleration  and  t  is  time,  it  follows  that 
after  one  year  the  accumulated  velocity  of  a  sail  facing  such  constant  pressure  in  vacuum  could 
be  as  much  as  (9/1000)3×107  ≅ 3×105  ms-1  =  c/1000.  Of  course  the  solar  photon  pressure 
declines as the square of the solar distance, and solar gravity would also act on such sails. 

Example 5.6A 
What  force  F  [N]  is  exerted  on  a  3-watt  flashlight  (λ ≅  0.5  microns)  as  a  result  of  the  exiting 
photons? 

Solution:  	 E  =  hf  and  power  P  = Nhf  =  3 watts, where N  is  the  number  of  photons  per  second. 
The  force  F  =  Nhf/c,  where  hf/c  is  the  momentum  of  a  single  photon,  and  N  =  3/hf 
here.  So F = 3/c = 10-8 Newtons.  A Newton approximates  the gravitational  force on 
the  quarter-pound  package  of  fig  newtons.  This  force  pushes  the  flashlight  in  the 
direction opposite to that of the light beam.
