Chapter 10:  Antennas and Radiation 

10.1  Radiation from charges and currents 

10.1.1 

Introduction to antennas and radiation 

An  antenna  is  a  device  that  couples  currents  to  electromagnetic waves  for  purposes  of  radiation 
or  reception.  The  process  by  which  antennas  radiate  can  be  easily  understood  in  terms  of  the 
way  in which  accelerating  charged particles or  time-varying  currents  radiate, which  is discussed 
in Section 10.1.  The expressions for radiated electromagnetic fields derived in Section 10.1.4 are 
simple extensions of those derived in Sections 10.1.2 and 10.1.3 for the fields produced by static 
charges and currents, respectively. 

Using  the  basic  expressions  for  radiation  derived  in  Section  10.1,  simple  short  dipole 
antennas are shown in Section 10.2 to have stable directional properties far from the antenna (the 
antenna  far  field),  and different directional properties  closer  than ~λ/2π  (the  antenna near  field). 
In Section  10.3  these  properties  are  related  to  basic metrics  that  characterize  each  antenna,  such 
as  gain,  effective  area,  and  impedance.    These  metrics  are  then  related  to  the  performance  of 
various  communications  systems.    Antenna  arrays  are  discussed  in  Section  10.4,  followed  by 
aperture and more complicated wire antennas in Sections 11.1 and 11.2, respectively. 

10.1.2  Electric fields around static charges 

One  simple way  to  generate  electromagnetic waves  is  to  vibrate  electric  charges,  creating  time-
varying  current.  The  equation  characterizing  this  radiation  is  very  similar  to  that  characterizing 
the  electric  fields  produced  by  a  single  static  charge, which  is  developed  below.    Section  10.1.3 
extends this result to magnetic fields produced by moving charges. 

Faraday’s and Gauss’s laws for static charges in vacuum are: 

∇ × E = 0

∇ • ε o E = ρ 

(10.1.1)

(10.1.2)
 

Since the curl of  E  is zero,  E  can be the gradient of any arbitrary scalar function  Φ ( r )  and 
still satisfy (10.1.1).  That is: 

E ( )r  = −  ∇Φ ( )  r 

 

(10.1.3)

where Φ is  the  scalar  electric  potential  and  is  in  units  of Volts.  The  negative  sign  is  consistent 
with  E   pointing  away  from  regions  of  high  potential  and  toward  lower  potentials.    Note  that 
(10.1.3)  satisfies  (10.1.1)  because  ∇ × −( ∇Φ )  ≡ 0   is  an  identity,  and  that  a  simple  three­
 
dimensional scalar field Φ fully characterizes the three-dimensional vector electric field  E ( r ) .  It 

- 301 -


is  therefore  often  easiest  to  find  the  electric  potential  Φ ( r )   before  computing  the  electric  field 
 
produced by static source charges. 

If the charge q [Coulombs] is spherically symmetric, both Φ and  E  must also be spherically 
symmetric.  The  only  way  a  vector  field  can  be  spherically  symmetric  is  for  it  to  be  directed 
radially, so: 

E = rˆE

r (r )
 

 

(10.1.4)

where r is the radius from the origin where the charge is centered and Er(r) is the radial field.  We 
can now  relate  E   to q by applying Gauss’s divergence  theorem  (2.4.6)  to  the volume  integral of 
Gauss’s law (10.1.2): 
(cid:120)∫∫∫ ( ∇ • ε o E ) dv =
(cid:119)∫∫
(cid:120)∫∫∫ ρ dv = q =

r (r )  da  
ˆ•  E  
r ε o E  r (r )  
ˆ
A

(10.1.5) 

Therefore the electric field produced by a charge q at the origin is: 

  Φ  ⎣⎡Vm  -  ⎦⎤
E ( )r  = rˆE  (r )  = rˆq  4  πε r 2  = −∇

(10.1.6)

To  find  the  associated  scalar  potential  Φ  we  integrate  (10.1.6)  using  the  definition  of  the 
gradient operator: 

∂ 
⎛
∇Φ  
 ≡ ⎜ xˆ 
⎝ ∂x 

+ yˆ

ˆ
+φ
r si n

∂  ⎤
Φ 
 
θ ∂φ ⎥⎦ 
 

 

(gradient in spherical coordinates) 

(10.1.8)

Since  the  spherically  symmetric  potential  Φ  (10.1.6)  is  independent  of  θ  and  φ,  it  follows  that 
∂ ∂θ = ∂ ∂φ = 0  and Equation (10.1.8) becomes: 

∇Φ = rˆ∂Φ ∂ r 

(10.1.9)
 

This  mathematical  simplification  occurs  only 
in  spherical  coordinates,  not  Cartesian. 
Substitution of (10.1.9)  into (10.1.6), followed by  integration of (10.1.6) with respect to radius r, 
yields: 

Φ ( )r  = ∫ ( q 4
where we define as zero the electric potential Φo contributed by any charge infinitely far away. 

πε o r = q  ( 4πε o  r ) 
 

(10.1.10) 

πε o r  ) dr

= Φ o + q 4

The  solution  for  the  electric  potential Φ  due  to  charge  q  at  some  position  r q   other  than  the 
origin follows from (10.1.10):   
Φ ( )r  = q  ( 4πε o  r − r q  ) = q  ( 4πε o

(10.1.11) 

)   [V]

rpq

 

 

 

which can alternatively be written using subscripts p and q to refer to the locations⎯rp  and⎯rq  of 
the  person  (or  observer)  and  the  charge,  respectively,  and  rpq  to  refer  to  the  distance  r p  − r q 
between them. 

If we  replace  the  charge  q with  a  charge  density ρq  in  the  infinitesimal  volume  dv,  then we 
can integrate (10.1.11) over the source region to obtain the total static electric potential produced 
by an arbitrary charge distribution ρq:

(10.1.12)

 

 

This  integration  to find Φp can be performed because Maxwell’s equations are  linear so  that 
superposition applies.  Thus we have a simple way  to compute Φp and  E   for any arbitrary static 
charge  density  distribution  ρq.  This  scalar  Poisson  integral  for  the  potential  function  Φ  is 
similar  to  that found for dynamic charge distributions  in  the next section.   The  integral (10.1.12) 
is also a solution to the Poisson equation: 

∇ Φ2 = −ρ εo   

(Poisson equation)  (10.1.13)
 

which follows from computing the divergence of Gauss’s law: 

∇ • {∇Φ

2
} 
 = −E  ⇒ ∇  Φ = −∇ • E = −ρ  ε o 

(10.1.14) 

Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation, ∇2Φ = 0, when ρ = 0. 

10.1.3  Magnetic fields around static currents


Maxwell’s equations governing static magnetic fields in vacuum are: 


∇ × H = J  

∇ • μ o H = 0  

(static Ampere’s law)  (10.1.15)
 

(Gauss’s law)
 

(10.1.16)
 

Because  the  divergence  of  H   is  always  zero,  we  can  define  the  magnetic  flux  density  in 
vacuum as being: 

- 303 -


B = μo H = ∇ × A  

(10.1.17)
 

where  A   is  defined  as  the magnetic  vector  potential, which  is  a  vector  analog  to Φ.  This  very 
general expression for  B  always satisfies Gauss’s law:  ∇ • ∇(  × A  ) ≡ 0 .

Substituting (10.1.17) into Ampere’s law (10.1.15) results in: 

∇ × (   ∇ × A ) = μ o J 

This can be simplified using the vector identity: 

2
∇ × ( 
  ∇ × A  ≡ ∇ • A ) − ∇  A 
(  ∇
)

(10.1.18)

(10.1.19) 

where we  note  that  ∇ • A   is  arbitrary  and  does  not  impact  any  of  our  prior  equations;  therefore 
we set it equal to zero.  Then (10.1.18) becomes the vector Poisson equation: 

∇ 2 A = −μ  o J   

(vector Poisson equation)  (10.1.20) 

The  three  vector  components  of  (10.1.20)  are  each  scalar  Poisson  equations  identical  to 
(10.1.13)  except  for  the  constant,  so  the  solution  is  nearly  identical  to  (10.1.12)  once  the 
constants have been reconciled; this solution is: 

A p  = (cid:120) ⎡μ
∫∫∫
Vq  ⎣ o Jq 

( 4πr
pq

)⎤ dv
⎦ 

⎡⎣V s m
 

-1 ⎦⎤

 

 

 

(10.1.21)

Thus  we  have  a  simple  way  to  compute  A   and  therefore  B   for  any  arbitrary  static  current 
distribution  J q . 

10.1.4  Electromagnetic fields produced by dynamic charges


In the static case of Section 10.1.2 it was very helpful to define the potential functions  A  and Φ, 

and the time-dependent Maxwell’s equations for vacuum permit us to do so again: 


∇ × E = −∂B   ∂t  

∇ × H = J + ∂D   ∂t  

∇ • E = ρ εo   

∇ • B = 0  

(Faraday’s law)  (10.1.22) 

(Ampere’s law)  (10.1.23) 

(Gauss’s law)  (10.1.24) 

(Gauss’s law)  (10.1.25)
 

- 304 -


Although  the  curl  of  E   is  no  longer  zero  so  that  E   no  longer  equals  the  gradient  of  some 
potential Φ, we can satisfy  ∇ • B = 0  if we define a vector potential  A  such that:

B = ∇ × A   = μ o H 

(10.1.26)
 

This definition of  A  always satsifies Gauss’s law:  ∇ • ∇( × A  ) ≡ 0 .  Substituting  ∇ × A  for  B  in  
Faraday’s law yields: 

∇ × E = −∂ ( ∇ × A ) ∂t 

Rearranging terms yields: 

∇ × ( E + ∂A   ∂t ) = 0 

(10.1.27)
 

(10.1.28)
 

which implies that the quantity  ( E + ∂A ∂t )  can be the gradient of any potential function Φ: 

E + ∂A ∂t = −∇Φ 

(  A 
= −  ∂  ∂t  + ∇Φ )  
E 

(10.1.29)
 

(10.1.30)

Thus dynamic  electric  fields have  two  components—one due  to  the  instantaneous value of Φ(t), 
and one proportional to the time derivative of  A . 

We  can  now  use  the  vector  identity  (10.1.19)  to  simplify  Ampere’s  law  after  (∇ × A ) μo 
replaces  H : 

  ∇ × A  = μ o ( J + ∂D   ∂t ) = ∇  ∇ • A  − ∇  A 
2
∇ × (
) 
(
) 

(10.1.31) 

By substituting (10.1.30) in (10.1.31) for  D = εo E  and grouping terms we obtain: 

∇2 A − ∇ (  ∇ • A   + μ ε ∂  Φ ∂ t ) − μ ε ∂ 2 
 A 
o o  
o o  

∂ 2 
t = −μ o J 

(10.1.32)

=A 0   because  specifying  the  curl  of  a  vector  field 
In  the  earlier  static  case  we  let  ∇ •
( B = ∇ × A )   does  not  constrain  its  divergence,  which  can  be  independently  chosen51.  Here  we 
can let: 

∇ • A = −μ  ε  ∂Φ ∂ 
t 
o o  

(10.1.33)

2
∇ × A  = ∇ × (  ∇ × N ) and  ∇ • A  = ∇ Φ  ,  so   ∇ × A  and  ∇ • A   can  be  chosen 
 
51 Let 
;  then 
A  = ∇Φ + ∇ × N 
independently simply by choosing  N  and Φ independently.

This reduces (10.1.32) to a simple equation by eliminating its second term, yielding: 

∇2 A − μ ε ∂ 2 
o o  

 A  ∂ 2 
t = −μ o J 

(10.1.34)

which  is called  the  inhomogeneous vector Helmholtz equation  (the homogeneous version has no 
source  term  on  the  right  hand  side;  J = 0 ).  It  is  a  wave  equation  for  A   driven  by  the  current
source  J . 

A  similar  inhomogeneous  wave  equation  relating  the  electric  potential  Φ  to  the  charge 
distribution ρ can also be derived.  Substituting (10.1.30) into Gauss’s law (10.1.24) yields: 

∇ • E = −∇ • (
   ∂A   ∂t   + ∇Φ )  = −∂ (   ∇ • A ) ∂τ − ∇  Φ 
2

(10.1.35) 

Replacing  ∇ • A  using (10.1.33) then produces: 

∇ • E = μ ε ∂ 2 
2
2
  Φ ∂ t  − ∇  Φ = ρ ε

which is more commonly written as the inhomogeneous scalar Helmholtz equation: 

∇ Φ2 − μ ε ∂ 2 Φ ∂t 2  = −ρ ε   
o o  
o 

(10.1.36)

(10.1.37)

analogous  to  the  vector  version  (10.1.34)  for  A .    These  inhomogeneous  scalar  and  vector 
Helmholtz  equations,  (10.1.34)  and  (10.1.37),  permit  us  to  calculate  the  electric  and  magnetic 
potentials  and  fields  produced  anywhere  in  vacuum  as  a  result  of  arbitrary  source  charges  and 
currents, as explained below. 

The  solutions  to  the  Helmholtz  equations  must  reduce  to:  a)  the  traveling-wave  solutions 
[e.g.,  (2.2.9)]  for  the  wave  equation  [e.g.,  (2.2.7)]  when  the  source  terms  are  zero,  and  b)  the 
static solutions (10.1.10) and (10.1.21) when ∂/∂t = 0.  The essential feature of solutions to wave 
equations is that their separate dependences on space and time must have the same form because 
their second derivatives with respect  to space and  time are  identical within a constant multiplier. 
These  solutions  can  therefore  be  expressed  as  an  arbitrary  function  of  a  single  argument  that 
sums time and space, e.g. (z - ct) or (t - rpq/c).  The solutions must also have the form of the static 
solutions  because  they  reduce  to  them  when  the  source  is  static.    Thus  the  solutions  to  the 
Helmholtz  inhomogeneous  equations  are  the  static  solutions  expressed  in  terms  of  the  argument 
(t - rpq/c):

These solutions are the dynamic scalar Poisson integral and the dynamic vector Poisson integral, 
respectively.   Note  that Φp  and  A p   depend  on  the  state  of  the  sources  at  some  time  in  the  past,  
not  on  their  instantaneous  values.    The  delay  rpq/c  is  the  ratio  of  the  distance  rpq  between  the 
source  and  observer,  and  the  velocity  of  light  c.   That  is,  rpq/c  is  simply  the  propagation  time 
between source and observer. 

10.2  Short dipole antennas 

10.2.1  Radiation from Hertzian dipoles 

Since  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  superposition  applies  and  therefore  the  electromagnetic 
field produced by an arbitrary current distribution is simply the integral of the fields produced by 
each  infinitesimal  element.    Thus  the  electromagnetic  field  response  to  an  infinitesimal  current 
element  is  analogous  to  the  impulse  response  of  a  linear  circuit,  and  comparably  useful  for 
calculating responses to arbitrary stimuli. 

The  simplest  infinitesimal  radiating  element,  called  a  Hertzian  dipole,  is  a  current  element 
of  length d carrying  I(t) amperes.   Conservation of charge  requires charge  reservoirs at each end 
of  the  current  element  containing  ±q(t)  coulombs,  where  I  =  dq/dt,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
 
10.2.1(a).  The  total  charge  is  zero.    If we  align  the  z  axis with  the  direction  of  the  current  and 
assume  the cross-sectional area of  the current element  is Ac [m2],  then  the current density within 
the element is: 

J  q ( t )  = zˆI( t )   A  
c 

⎡⎣Am  -2 ⎤⎦ 

(10.2.1)

Substituting this current density into the expression (10.1.39) for vector potential yields:

(10.2.2)

 

where integration over the volume V of the current element yielded a factor of Acd. 

To  obtain  simple  expressions  for  the  radiated  electric  and  magnetic  fields  we  must  now 
switch  to:  1)  time-harmonic  representations  because  radiation  is  frequency  dependent,  and  2) 
polar  coordinates  because  the  symmetry  of  the  radiation  is  polar,  not  cartesian,  as  suggested  in

These solutions (10.2.5–6) for the Hertzian dipole are fundamental because they permit us to 
calculate  easily  the  radiation  from  arbitrary  current  sources.    It  suffices  to  know  the  source 
current  distribution  because  it  uniquely  determines  the  charge  distribution  via  conservation  of 
charge (2.1.19), and therefore the charge does not radiate independently. 

These  solutions  for  E   and  H   are  polynomials  in  1/jkr,  so  they  have  two  asymptotes—one 
for  large  values  of  kr  and  one  for  small  values.    When  kr  is  very  large  the  lowest  order  terms 
dominate, so kr = 2πr/λ >> 1, or:

These  expressions  are  identical,  except  that  E   points  in  the  θ  direction  while  H   points  in  the 
orthogonal φ direction; the radial components are negligible in the far field.  Also: 

E  =  H ηo 

(10.2.10)
 

where  the  impedance  of  free  space  ηo  =  μ o
/ε  ≅  377  ohms.   We  found  similar  orthogonality

and proportionality for uniform plane waves in Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. 

We  can  calculate  the  radiated  intensity  in  the  far  field  using  (2.7.41)  and  the  field

Hertzian dipoles preferentially radiate laterally, with zero radiation along their axis.  The electric 
field  strength  Eθ varies  as  sin  θ,  which  yields  a  circle  in  a  polar  plot,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
10.2.2(a).  The distance L  in  the plot corresponds  to  Eθ .  Since  sin2 45o = 0.5,  the width of  the 
beam between half-power points in the θ direction is 90o. 

The  total power PR  radiated by  a Hertzian dipole  can be calculated by  integrating  the  radial

Because  S = ×E  H     is  purely  negative  imaginary  in  the  near  fields,  these  fields  correspond  to 
reactive  power  and  stored  electric  energy.    Integrating  the  exact  expressions  for  S   over  4π 
steradians  yields  a  real  part  that  is  independent  of  r;  that  is,  the  total  power  radiated  is  the  same 
(10.2.13) regardless of the radius r at which we integrate, even in the near field. 

A  simple  expression  for  H   in  the  near  field  of  the  source  is  called  the  Biot-Savart  law;  it 
easily  follows  from  the  expression  (10.2.5)  for  magnetic  fields  close  to  a  current  element  Id zˆ 
when kr << 1: 

H = φˆ (Id sin

The  Biot-Savart  law  relates  arbitrary  current  distributions  J(r ',t ) to  H(r ,t ) when  the  distance

10.2.3  Short dipole antennas 

Antennas transform freely propagating electromagnetic waves into circuit voltages for reception, 
and  also  transform  such  voltages  into  free-space  waves  for  transmission.    They  are  used  for 
wireless  communications,  power  transmission,  or  surveillance  at  wavelengths  ranging  from 
micrometers  (infrared  and  visible  wavelengths)  to  hundreds  of  kilometers.    Their  sophistication 
and  performance  continue  to  increase  as  improved  computational  and  fabrication  methods  are 
developed, although simple structures still dominate today. 

Determining  the  fields  and  currents  associated  with  a  given  antenna  can  be  difficult  using 
traditional  approaches  to  boundary  value  problems  because  many  waves  must  usually  be 
superimposed  in  order  to  match  boundary  conditions,  even  when  well  chosen  orthogonal  wave 
expansions  other  than  plane-waves  are  used.  Fortunately  modern  computer  software  tools  can 
handle  most  antenna  problems.    Here  we  take  a  traditional  alternative  approach  to  antenna 
analysis  that  yields  acceptable  solutions  for  most  common  configurations  by  making  one  key 
assumption—that  the  current  distribution  on  the  antenna  is  known.    Determination  of  antenna 
current distributions is discussed in Sections 11.1–2. 

Arbitrary  antenna  current distributions  can be  approximated by  superimposing  infinitesimal 
Hertzian dipole radiators that have constant current  I  over an infinitesimal length d.  The electric 
far  fields  each  dipole  radiates  are  given  by  (10.2.8),  and  the  total  radiated  field  E   is  simply  the 
sum of  these differential contributions.   Superposition of  these fields  is valid because Maxwell’s 
equations are linear.  H  can then be readily found using Faraday’s law or direct integration.  This 
is  the approach  taken here;  the  far  fields of  the short dipole antenna are  found by  integrating  the 
contributions from each  infinitesimal element of  that dipole.   From these fields  the antenna gain, 
effective  area,  and  circuit  properties  can  then  be  found,  as  discussed  in  Section  10.3.    Many 
practical antennas, such as those used in many cars for the ~1-MHz Amplitude-Modulated (AM) 
band,  are  approximately  short-dipole  antennas  with  lengths  less  than  a  few  percent  of  the 
associated  wavelength  λ.  Their  simple  behavior  provides  an  easy  introduction  to  antenna 
analysis.

Consider  the  short-dipole  antenna  illustrated  in  Figure  10.2.3.    It  has  length  d  <<  λ  and  is 
 
driven  by  a  current  source with  Io   amperes  at  angular  frequency  ω  [radians/second].  Complex 
notation is used here for simplicity because antenna characteristics are frequency-dependent.  As 
discussed later, the wires, or “feed-lines”, providing current to the dipole do not alter the dipole’s 
radiated fields because those wires are perpendicular to the antenna fields and also do not radiate.

Because  both  these  far  fields  E ff   and  the  near  fields  are  perpendicular  to  the  x-y  plane

vector on its outer surface is zero so it radiates no power.

G(θ,φ)  is defined as  the  ratio of  the  intensity P(θ,φ,r)  to  the  intensity  [Wm-2]  that would  result  if 
the same  total power available at  the antenna  terminals, PA  [W], were  radiated  isotropically over 
4π steradians.  G(θ,φ) is often called “gain over isotropic” where: 

G ,( 
)
θ φ  ≡ 

P r(  ,

( P 4A

(antenna gain definition) 

(10.3.1)

A  related  quantity  is  antenna  directivity  D(θ,φ),  which  is  normalized  to  the  total  power 
radiated PT rather than to the power PA available at the antenna terminals:

2 
T  = r ∫  P ( r,
 θ φ,  ) sin θ dθ d
Since  the  total  power  radiated  is  P
 φ ,  a  useful  relation  follows  from
 
4π
(10.3.2): 

(antenna directivity definition) 

(cid:118)∫ D ,( θ φ ) sin  d θd θ φ = 4π 
4π 

(10.3.3)

Equation  (10.3.3)  says  that  if  the  directivity  or  gain  is  large  in  one  direction,  it  must  be 
correspondingly diminished elsewhere, as suggested in Figure 10.2.4, where the pattern is plotted 
relative to an isotropic radiator and exhibits its “main lobe” in the direction θ = 90°.  This pattern 
is  independent  of  φ.  The  half-power  antenna  beamwidth  in  the  θ direction  is  the  angle  θB 
between  two  directions where  the  radiated  power  is  half  that  radiated  at  the  peak,  as  illustrated. 
Thus  (10.3.3)  and  the  figure  also  suggest  that  high  directivity  antennas  have  narrower 
beamwidths θB, or are more “directive”. 

The  ratio  PT/PA  is  that  fraction  of  the  power  available  at  the  antenna  terminals  (PA)  that  is 
radiated; it is defined as the radiation efficiency ηR: 

η ≡ P P
T  A  
R

G ,( θ φ )  ≡ η R D ( θ φ,  )  

(radiation efficiency) 

(10.3.4)

(10.3.5)

The radiation efficiency is usually near unity because the resistive losses and the reflective losses 
due  to  impedance mismatches  are  small  in most  systems.   Typical  exceptions  to  the  rule ηR  ≅ 1 
include  most  short  dipoles  and  antennas  that  are  used  over  bandwidths  much  greater  than  an 
octave; their impedances are difficult to match. 

The directivity of a short dipole antenna is given by substituting (10.2.27) and (10.2.28) into 
(10.3.2):

10.3.2  Circuit properties of antennas 

Antennas  connect  to  electrical  circuits,  and  therefore  it  is  important  to  understand  the  circuit 
properties  of  antennas.  The  linearity  of  Maxwell’s  equations  applies  to  antennas,  so  they  can 
therefore  be  modeled  by  a  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  consisting  of  a  Thevenin  equivalent 
impedance ZA in series with a Thevenin voltage source VTh.  This section evaluates the Thevenin 
equivalent impedance ZA, and Section 10.3.3 evaluates VTh.  The frequency dependence of  these 
circuit  equivalents  usually  does  not  map  neatly  into  that  of  inductors,  capacitors,  and  resistors, 
and so we simply use complex notation and a generalized ZA(ω) instead, where: 

Z (
)
) R (
(
A  ω = ω +  j X

)ω 

 

(10.3.8) 

R(ω)  is  the  resistive  part  of  the  impedance  corresponding  to  the  total  power  dissipated  and 
radiated, and X(ω) is the reactive part, corresponding to near-field energy storage. 

To  find ZA(ω) we  can  use  the  integral  form  of  Poynting’s  theorem  (2.7.23)  for  a  volume V 
bounded by surface area A to relate the terminal voltage V and current I to the near and far fields 
of any antenna:

of the coaxial feed line, and A''' is far from the antenna and intercepts only radiated fields.

Equation  (10.3.10)  simply  expresses  in  two  different  ways  the  power  flowing  away  from  the

oriented  outward  and  the  current  flow  I  is  oriented  inward.  Because  no  power  flows

X(ω) is the antenna reactance, and the integral in (10.3.14) is the dissipative component Rd(ω) of 
antenna  resistance  R(ω).  If  the  average  near-field magnetic  energy  storage  exceeds  the  electric 
energy  storage,  then  the  antenna  reactance  X  is  positive  and  inductive;  if  the  energy  stored  is 
predominantly electric, then X is negative and capacitive.  In practice the real part of the jω term 
∗
in (10.3.14) is usually zero, as is the imaginary part of the  E • J    term in (10.3.15), but there can
be  exceptions.  The  R  and  X  of  antennas  are  seldom  computed  analytically,  but  are  usually 
determined by experiment or computational tools.

The  radiation  resistance  Rr  of  short  dipole  antennas  can  be  estimated  using  (10.3.12)  and 
(10.2.28); the dissipative resistance Rd in short wires given by (10.3.14) is usually negligible:

The effective  length deff of a short dipole  is approximately half  its physical  length  [see  (10.2.25) 
and Figure 10.2.3]. 

The  reactance X  of  a  short  dipole  antenna  can  be  found  using  (10.3.15);  it  results  primarily 
from  the  energy  stored  in  the  near  fields.    The  near-field  energy  for  short  or Hertzian  dipoles  is 
predominantly  electric,  since  the  near-field  E ∝ r −3   (10.2.15)  while  the  near-field  H ∝ r −2 
(10.2.16), and r→ 0.  Since the electric term of (10.3.15) is much greater than the magnetic term, 
X is negative.

10.3.3  Receiving properties of antennas 

Because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear  in  field  strength,  antennas  have  equivalent  circuits 
consisting  of  a  Thevenin  equivalent  impedance  ZA(ω),  given  by  (10.3.13),  in  series  with  a 
Thevenin  voltage  source  VTh(ω)  that  we  can  now  evaluate.    Non-zero  voltages  appear  when 
antennas  receive  signals,  where  these  voltages  depend  upon  the  direction,  polarization,  and 
strength of the intercepted waves. 

Figure  10.3.1(a)  illustrates  the  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  for  any  antenna,  and  Figure 
10.3.1(b)  illustrates  the  electric  fields  and  equipotentials  associated  with  a  short  dipole  antenna 
intercepting a uniform plane wave polarized parallel  to  the dipole axis.   When  the wavelength λ 
greatly  exceeds  d  and  other  local  dimensions  of  interest,  i.e.  λ → ∞,  then Maxwell’s  equations 
become: 

∇ × E = − j ( 2

πc λ ) B  → 0
 

 for

 λ → ∞ 

∇ × H = J +  j ( 2

 πc   λ ) D → J

 λ → ∞

But these limits are the equations of electrostatics and magnetostatics.  Therefore we can quickly 
sketch  the  electric  field  lines  near  the  short  dipole  of  Figure  10.3.1  using  a  three-dimensional 
version of the quasistatic field mapping technique of Section 4.6.2.

Figure 10.3.1  Thevenin voltage induced on a short dipole antenna. 
 

Far from the dipole the field lines  E  in Figure 10.3.1(b) are those of the quasistatic incident 
plane wave, i.e., uniform and parallel to the dipole.  Close to the conducting dipole  E  is distorted 
to match  the  boundary  conditions:  1)  E(cid:38)  = 0 ,  and  2)  each  half  of  the  dipole  is  an  equipotential, 
intercepting  only  one  equipotential  line  (boldface,  dashed).    If  the  wires  comprising  the  short 
dipole  are  very  thin,  the  effects  of  each  wire  on  the  other  are  negligible.    Under  these 
assumptions  symmetry  dictates  the  form  for  three  of  the  equipotentials  in  Figure  10.3.1—the 
equipotentials  through  the  center  of  the  dipole  and  through  each  of  its  two  halves  are  straight 
lines.    The  other  equipotentials  sketched  with  dashed  lines  curve  around  the  conductors.    The 
field  lines  E   are  sketched with  solid  lines  locally  perpendicular  to  the  equipotentials.  The  field 
lines  terminate  at  charges  on  the  surface  of  the  conductors  and  possibly  at  infinity,  as  governed 
by Gauss’s law:  nˆ •
=D  σs .  

Figures  10.3.1(b)  and  (c)  suggest  why  the  open-circuit  voltage  VTh  of  the  short  dipole 
antenna equals the potential difference between the centers of the two halves of this ideal dipole: 

VTh  ≡ −E • deff	

(voltage induced on dipole antenna)  (10.3.19)

The effective  length of  the dipole,  deff  ,  is defined by  (10.3.19), and  is  the same as  the effective 
length defined  in  terms of  the current distribution (10.2.25) for  infinitesimally  thin straight wires 
of  length  d  <<  λ.  Generally  deff  ≅ d
 
2
 
,  which  is  the  distance  between  the  centers  of  the  two 
conductors.  Each  conductor  is  essentially  sampling  the  electrostatic  potential  in  its  vicinity  and 
conveying  that  to  the  antenna  terminals.    The  orientation  of  deff   is  that  of  the  dipole  current 
flow that would be driven by external sources having the defined terminal polarity. 

The maximum power an antenna can deliver to an external circuit of impedance ZL is easily 
 
computed  once  the  antenna  equivalent  circuit  is  known.    To  maximize  this  transfer  it  is  first 
necessary  to  add  an  external  load  reactance,  -jXL,  in  series  to  cancel  the  antenna  reactance  +jX 
(X  is negative  for  a  short dipole  antenna because  it  is  capacitive).   Then  the  resistive part of  the 
load RL must match that of the antenna, i.e., RL = Rr.  Maximum power transfer occurs when the 
impedances match  so  incident waves are not  reflected.    In  this conjugate-match case  (ZL = Z *
A ), 
the antenna Thevenin voltage VTh is divided across the two resistors Rr and RL so that the voltage 
across RL is VTh/2 and the power received by the short dipole antenna is:

(antenna effective area)  (10.3.23) 

Equation (10.3.23) says that the effective area of a matched short-dipole antenna is equivalent  to 
 
a  square  roughly λ/3 on a  side,  independent of antenna  length.    A  small wire  structure  (<< λ/3) 
can  capture  energy  from  this  much  larger  area  if  it  has  a  conjugate  match,  which  generally 

53 This expression requires that all media near the antenna be reciprocal, which means that no magnetized plasmas or 
ferrites  should  be  present  so  that  the  permittivity  and  permeabiliy  matrices  ε and  μ  everywhere  equal  their  own 
transposes.

requires  a  high-Q  resonance,  large  field  strengths,  and  high  losses.    In  practice,  short-dipole 
antennas generally have a reactive mismatch that reduces their effective area below optimum. 

10.3.4  Generalized relation between antenna gain and effective area 

Section  10.3.3  proved  for  a  short-dipole  antenna  the  basic  relation  (10.3.23)  between  antenna 
gain G(θ,φ) and antenna effective area A(θ,φ): 

λ2 
A ,(θ φ)  = G(θ, φ)  
4π

(10.3.24)
 

This  relation can be proven  for any arbitrary antenna provided all media  in and near  the antenna 
are  reciprocal media,  i.e.,  their  complex  permittivity,  permeability,  and  conductivity matrices  ε, 
μ, and σ are all symmetric: 

ε = ε t ,  μ = μ t ,  σ = σ t 

(10.3.25) 

where we define  the  transpose operator  t such  that At
ij = Aji.  Non-reciprocal media are  rare, but 
include magnetized  plasmas  and magnetized  ferrites;  they  are  not  discussed  in  this  text.   Media 
characterized by matrices are discussed in Section 9.5.1. 

To prove (10.3.24) we characterize a general linear 2-port network by its impedance matrix: 

⎡Z11  Z12 ⎤
Z = ⎢ 
⎥  
⎣Z21  Z22 ⎦

V = ZI

(impedance matrix)  (10.3.26)

(10.3.27)

where  V  and  I  are  the  two-element voltage and current vectors [V1, V2] and [I1, I2], and Vi and 
Ii are the voltage and current at terminal pair i.  This matrix  Z  does not depend on the network to 
t 
which the 2-port is connected.  If the 2-port system is a reciprocal network, then  Z = Z , so Z12 =
Z21. 

Since  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  V  is  linearly  related  to  I,  and  we  can  define  an 
antenna  impedance  Z11  consisting  of  a  real  part  (10.3.14),  typically  dominated  by  the  radiation 
resistance Rr  (10.3.12),  and  a  reactive part  jX  (10.3.15).  Thus  Z11 = R1 +  jX1, where R1  equals 
the  sum  of  the  dissipative  resistance Rd1  and  the  radiation  resistance Rr1.  For most  antennas Rd 
<< Rr. 

Figure 10.3.2  illustrates an unknown reciprocal antenna (1)  that communicates with a short-
dipole  test  antenna  (2)  that  is  aimed  at  antenna  (1).    Because  the  relations  between  the  voltages 
and  currents  at  the  terminals  are  determined  by  electromagnetic  waves  governed  by  the  linear 
Maxwell  equations,  the  two  antennas  constitute  a  two-port  network  governed  by  (10.3.26)  and

(10.3.27)  and  the  complex  impedance matrix  Z .  Complex  notation  is  appropriate  here  because 
antennas  are  frequency  dependent.    This  impedance  representation  easily  introduces  the 
reciprocity  constraint  to  the  relation  between  G(θ,φ)  and  A(θ,φ).  We  assume  each  antenna  is 
matched to its load ZL = Rr – jX so as to maximize power transfer.

The  power  Pr  received  by  each  antenna  and  dissipated  in  the  load  can  be  expressed  in  two

10.4  Antenna arrays 

10.4.1  Two-dipole arrays 

Although  some  communications  services  such  as  mobile  phones  use  nearly  omnidirectional 
electric  or  magnetic  dipole  antennas  (short-dipole  and  loop  antennas),  most  fixed  services  such 
as point-to-point, broadcast, and satellite services benefit  from  larger antenna gains.   Also, some 
applications  require  rapid  steering  of  the  antenna  beam  from  one  point  to  another,  or  even  the 
ability to observe or transmit in multiple narrow directions simultaneously.  Antenna arrays with 
two  or  more  dipoles  can  support  all  of  these  needs.    Arrays  of  other  types  of  antennas  can 
similarly boost performance. 

Since the effective area of an antenna, A(θ,φ), is simply related by (10.3.36) to antenna gain 
G(θ,φ),  the  gain  of  a  dipole  array  fully  characterizes  its  behavior,  which  is  determined  by  the 
array current distribution.  Sometimes some of the dipoles are simply mirrored images of others. 

In  every  case  the  total  radiated  field  is  simply  the  superposition  of  the  fields  radiated  by 
each  contributing  dipole  in  proportion  to  its  strength,  and  delayed  in  proportion  to  its  distance 
from  the observer.   For  two-dipole arrays,  the differential path  length  to  the  receiver  can  lead  to 
reinforcement if the two sinusoidal waves are in phase, cancellation if they are 180o out of phase 
and equal, and intermediate strength otherwise. 

- 324 -


It  is  convenient  to  represent  the  signals  as  phasors  since  the  patterns  are  frequency 
dependent,  so  the  total  observed  electric  field  E = ∑ i E i  , where  E i   is  the  observed  contribution 
from  short-dipole  i,  including  its  associated  phase  lag  of  γi  radians  due  to  distance  traveled. 
Consider  first  the  two-dipole  array  in  Figure  10.4.1(a),  where  the  dipoles  are  z-axis  oriented, 
parallel,  fed  in  phase,  and  spaced  distance  L  apart  laterally  in  the  y  direction.    Any  observer  in 
the  x-z  plane  separating  the  dipoles  receives  equal  in-phase  contributions  from  each  dipole, 
thereby  doubling  the  observed  far-field  E ff   and  quadrupling  the  power  intensity  P  [Wm-2] 
radiated in that direction θ relative to what would be transmitted by a single dipole.

The  radiated  power  P(r,φ)  in  Figure  10.4.1  depends  on  the  differential  phase  lag  γ  between 
the contributions  from  the  two antennas.   When  the  two dipoles are excited equally  ( I1  = I 2  = I ) 
and  are  spaced  L  =  λ/2  apart,  the  two  rays  add  in  phase  everywhere  in  the  x-z  plane 
perpendicular  to  the  array  axis,  but  are  λ/2  (180o)  out  of  phase  and  cancel  along  the  array  (y) 
axis.  The resulting G(φ)  is sketched  in Figure 10.4.2(a) for  the x-y plane.   If L = λ as  illustrated 
in  Figure  10.4.2(b),  then  the  two  rays  add  in  phase  along  both  the  x-z  plane  and  the  y  axis,  but 
cancel  in  the x-y plane  at φnull = 30o where  the differential delay between  the  two  rays  is λ/2, as 
suggested by the right triangle in the figure. 

Figure 10.4.2(c)  illustrates how  a non-symmetric pattern  can be  synthesized by  exciting  the 
two dipoles out of phase.  In  this  case  the  lower dipole  leads  the upper dipole by 90 degrees,  so 
that the total phase difference between the two rays propagating in the negative y direction is 180 
degrees,  producing  cancellation;  this  phase  difference  is  zero  degrees  for  radiation  in  the  +y 
direction, so the two rays add.  Along the ±x axis the two rays are 90 degrees out of phase so the 
total  E  is  2 greater  than  from  a  single  dipole,  and  the  intensity  is  doubled.    When  the  two 
phasors  are  in  phase  the  total  E  is  doubled  and  the  radiated  intensity  is  4  times  that  of  a  single 
dipole; thus the intensity radiated along the ±x axis is half that radiated along the +y axis.  Figure 
10.4.2(d)  illustrates  how  a  null-free  pattern  can  be  synthesized  with  non-equal  excitation  of  the 
two dipoles.  In this case the two dipoles are driven in phase so that the radiated phase difference 
is  180  degrees  along  the  ±y  axis  due  to  the  λ/2  separation  of  the  dipoles.   Nulls  are  avoided  by 

- 325 -


exciting either dipole with a current that is ~40 percent of the other so that the ratio of maximum 
gain to minimum gain is ~[(1 + 0.4)/(1 - 0.4)]2 = 5.44, and the pattern is vaguely rectangular.

where we have used the identities ejα + e-jα = 2 cosα and k = 2π/λ. 

Example 10.4A 
If the two dipoles of Figure 10.4.1 are fed in phase and their separation is L = 2λ, at what angles 
φ in the x-y plane are there nulls and peaks in the gain G(φ)?  Are these peaks equal?  Repeat this 
analysis for L = λ/4, assuming the voltage driving the dipole at y > 0 has a 90° phase lag relative 
to the other dipole. 

Solution:	 Referring  to  Figure  10.4.1,  there  are  nulls  when  the  phase  difference  γ  between  the 
two  rays  arriving  at  the  receiver  is  π  or  3π,  or  equivalently,  D  =  λ/2  or  3λ/2, 
sin-1(D/L)  =

±sin-1[(λ/2)/2λ]  =  ±  sin-1(0.25)  ≅ ±14°,  and  φ  =  ±  sin-1(0.75)  ≅ ±49°.  There  are  also 
nulls, by  symmetry, at angles 180° away, or at φ ≅ ±194° and ±229°.  There are gain 
peaks when the two rays are in phase (φ = 0° and 180°) and when they differ in phase 
by 2π or 4π, which happens when φ = ± sin-1(λ/2λ) = ±30° and φ = ±210°, or when φ 
= ±90°, respectively.  The gain peaks are equal because they all correspond to the two 
rays adding coherently with the same magnitudes.   When L = λ/4 the  two rays add in 
phase at φ = 90° along the +y axis because in that direction the phase lag balances the 
90°  delay  suffered  by  the  ray  from  the  dipole  on  the  -y  axis.   At  φ  =  270°  these  two 
90-degree  delays  add  rather  than  cancel,  so  the  two  rays  cancel  in  that  direction, 
producing a perfect null. 

10.4.2  Array antennas with mirrors 

One of the simplest ways to boost the gain of a short dipole antenna is to place a mirror behind it 
to  as  to  reinforce  the  radiation  in  the  desired  forward  direction  and  cancel  it  behind.    Figure 
10.4.3  illustrates how a short current element I placed near a perfectly conducting planar surface 
will  behave  as  if  the  mirror  were  replaced  by  an  image  current  an  equal  distance  behind  the 
mirror  and  pointed  in  the  opposite  direction  parallel  to  the  mirror  but  in  the  same  direction 
normal to the mirror.  The fields in front of the mirror are identical with and without the mirror if 
it is sufficiently large.  Behind the mirror the fields approach zero, of course.  Image currents and 
charges were discussed in Section 4.2. 

Figure 10.4.3(a)  illustrates  a  common way  to boost  the  forward gain of  a dipole  antenna by 
placing it λ/4 in front of a planar mirror and parallel to it.

Figure 10.4.3  Half-wave dipole antenna λ/4 in front of a mirror. 
 

The image current is 180 degrees out of phase, so the λ/2 delay suffered by the image ray brings 
it  into phase coherence with  the direct  ray, effectively doubling  the  far  field Eff and quadrupling 
the  intensity  and  gain  Go  relative  to  the  absence  of  the  mirror.    In  all  directions  more  nearly 
parallel  to  the  mirror  the  source  and  image  are  more  nearly  out  of  phase,  so  the  gain  in  those 
directions  is diminished  relative  to  the absence of  the mirror.   The  resulting antenna gain G(θ,φ) 
is sketched in Figure 10.4.3(b), and has no backlobes.

For  the  case  where  the  dipole  current  I2  =  - I1  and  kr1  =  kr  -  (π/2)cosβ,  the  far-field  in  the

This expression  reveals  that  the antenna pattern has no sidelobes and  is pinched somewhat more 
in  the  θ  direction  than  in  the  β  direction  (these  directions  are  not  orthogonal).    An  on-axis 
observer will receive a z-polarized signal. 

Mirrors  can  also  be  parabolic  and  focus  energy  at  infinity,  as  discussed  further  in  Section 
11.1.  The  sidelobe-free  properties  of  this  dipole-plus-mirror  make  it  a  good  antenna  feed  for 
radiating energy toward much larger parabolic reflectors. 

Example 10.4B 
Automobile  antennas  often  are  thin  metal  rods  ~1-meter  long  positioned  perpendicular  to  an 
approximately  flat  metal  surface  on  the  car;  the  rod  and  flat  surface  are  electrically  insulated 
from  each  other.    The  rod  is  commonly  fed  by  a  coaxial  cable,  the  center  conductor  being 
attached  to  the  base  of  the  rod  and  the  sheath  being  attached  to  the  adjacent  car  body. 
Approximately  what  is  the  radiation  resistance  and  pattern  in  the  1-MHz  radio  broadcast  band, 
assuming the flat plate is infinite? 

Solution:  	 Figure 4.2.3 shows how  the  image of a current flowing perpendicular  to a conducting 
plane flows in the same direction as the original current, so any current flowing in the 
rod  has  an  image  current  that  effectively  doubles  the  length  of  this  antenna.    The 
wavelength  at  1  MHz  is  ~300  meters,  much  longer  than  the  antenna,  so  the  short-
dipole  approximation  applies  and  the  current  distribution  on  the  rod  and  its  image 
resembles  that  of  Figure  10.2.3;  thus  deff  ≅  1  meter  and  the  pattern  above  the  metal 
plane  is  the  top half of  that  illustrated  in Figure 10.2.4.   The  radiation  resistance of  a 
normal short dipole antenna (10.3.16) is Rr = 2PT/|Io|2 = 2η
2
oπ(deff/λ) /3 = 0.0088 ohms 
for deff = 1 meter.  Here, however, the total power radiated PT is half that radiated by a 
short  dipole  of  length  2  meters  because  there  is  no  power  radiated  below  the 
conducting  plane,  so Rr  =  0.0044  ohms.   The  finite  size  of  an  automobile  effectively 
warps  and  shortens  both  the  image  current  and  the  effective  length  of  the  dipole, 
although  the antenna pattern  for a straight current  is always dipolar above  the ground 
plane.

10.4.3  Element and array factors 

The  power  radiated  by  dipole  arrays  depends  on  the  directional  characteristics  of  the  individual 
dipole  antennas  as well  as  on  their  spacing  relative  to wavelength  λ.  For  example,  (10.4.3)  can 
be generalized to N identically oriented but independently positioned and excited dipoles:

(10.4.5)

The 	 element  factor  ε ( θ, φ )   for  the  dipole  array  represents  the  behavior  of  a  single  element, 
assuming  the  individual  elements  are  identically  oriented.    The  array  factor,  F ( θ, φ =)
 
∑ N I e− jkri 
,  represents  the  effects  of  the  relative  strengths  and  placement  of  the  elements.    The
i

distance between the observer and each element i of the array is ri, and the phase lag kri = 2πri/λ. 

 

Consider  the  element  factor  in  the  x-y  plane  for  the  two  z-oriented  dipoles  of  Figure

This  element  factor  ε ( θ, φ ) is  constant,  independent  of  φ,  and  has  a  circular  pattern.    The  total

antenna  pattern  is  ε (	 θ, φ ) F ( θ, φ ) where  the  array  factor  F ( θ, φ ) controls  the  array  antenna

pattern in the x-y plane for these two dipoles.  The resulting antenna pattern  F (

 in the x-y 
plane  is plotted  in Figure 10.4.4(a) and  (b)  for  the special cases L = λ/2 and L = λ,  respectively.

Both  the  array  and  element  factors  contribute  to  the  pattern  for  this  antenna  in  the  x-z  plane, 
narrowing its beamwidth (not illustrated). 

Figure  10.4.4  illustrates  a  case where  both  the  element  and  array  factors  are  important; L = 
λ/2 here and the dipoles are fed 180o out of phase.  In this case the out-of-phase signals from the 
two dipoles cancel everywhere in  the x-y plane and add  in phase along the z axis, corresponding 
to  the  array  factor plotted  in Figure 10.4.4(b)  for  the y-z plane.   Note  that when θ = 60o  the  two

phasors are 45o out of phase and  F (
 has half its peak value.  The element factor in the y-z

plane appears in Figure 10.4.4(c), and the dashed antenna pattern  ε ( )θ  F  ( )θ  ∝ G ( )θ  in Figure 
10.4.4(d)  shows  the  effects  of  both  factors  (only  one  of  the  four  lobes  is  plotted).    This  antenna 
pattern is a figure of revolution about the z axis and resembles two wide rounded cones facing in 
opposite directions.

10.4.4  Uniform dipole arrays 

Uniform  dipole  arrays  consist  of  N  identical  dipole  antennas  equally  spaced  in  a  straight  line. 
Their  current  excitation  Ii  has  equal  magnitudes  for  all  i,  and  a  phase  angle  that  uniformly 
increases  by  ψ  radians  between  adjacent  dipoles.    The  fields  radiated  by  the  array  can  be 
determined using (10.4.5):

The  z  axis  is  defined  by  the  orientation  of  the  dipoles, which  are  all  parallel  to  it.   The  simplest 
arrangement  of  the  dipoles  is  along  that  same  z  axis,  as  in  Figure  10.4.5,  although  (10.4.6) 
applies  equally  well  if  the  dipoles  are  spaced  in  any  arbitrary  direction.    Figure  10.4.1(a) 
illustrates  the  alternate  case  where  two  dipoles  are  spaced  along  the  y  axis,  and  Figure  10.4.2

If  the  elements  are  excited  in  phase  (ψ  =  0),  then  the maximum  gain  is  broadside with  θ = 
900, because only  in  that direction do  all N  rays  add  in perfect phase.    In  this  case  the  first nulls

θfirst null  ≡ π/2 ± θfn, where θfn is the null angle measured from the x-y plane rather than from the z

The  following  simple  geometric  argument  yields  the  same  answer.    Figure  10.4.5(b)  shows

element  cancel,  for  then  the  rays  from  the  second  and  fifth,  and  the  third  and  sixth  will  also 
cancel.  This  total  cancellation  occurs  when  the  delay  between  the  first  and  fourth  ray  is  λ/2, 
which corresponds to the angle θfn = ±sin-1[(λ/2)/(aN/2)] ≅ ±λ/aN.

Figure 10.4.6  Antenna pattern for N-element linear dipole array.
 

 
The  angle  θfn  between  the  beam  axis  and  the  first  null  is  approximately  the  half-power 
beamwidth  θB  of  an N-element  antenna  array.   The  antenna  gain G(θ)  associated with  (10.4.11) 
for  N  =  6,  ψ =  0,  and  a  =  λ/2  is  sketched  in  Figure  10.4.6(a),  together  with  the  squares  of  the 

- 332 -


array  factor  [from  (10.4.10)] and element  factor  [from  (10.4.6)].    In  this case θfn = ±sin-1(2/N) ≅ 
±2/N radians ≅ θB. 

If ψ ≠ 0 so that the excitation phase varies linearly across the array, then the main beam and 
the  rest of  the pattern  is “squinted” or “scanned”  to one side by angle α.  Since a phase delay of 
ψ  is  equivalent  to  a  path  delay  of  δ,  where  ψ  =  kδ,  and  since  the  distance  between  adjacent 
dipoles  is  a,  it  follows  that  adjacent  rays  for  a  scanned beam will be  in phase  at  angle θ = π/2 + 
sin-1(δ/a) = π/2 + α, where: 

α = sin −1 ( δ a ) = sin −1 (ψλ  2πa )	  

(scan angle)  (10.4.14) 

as sketched in Figure 10.4.6(b) for the case ψ = 2 radians, a = λ/2, and α ≅ 40o . 

Note that larger element separations a can produce multiple main lobes separated by smaller 
ones.  Additional  main  lobes  appear  when  the  argument  (ψ  +  ka  cosθ)/2  in  the  denominator  of 
(10.4.11) is an integral multiple of π so that the denominator is zero; the numerator is zero at the 
same  angles,  so  the  ratio  is  finite  although  large.    To  preclude  multiple  main  lobes  the  spacing 
should be a < λ, or even a < λ/2 if the array is scanned. 

Example 10.4D 
A uniform row of 100 x-oriented dipole antennas lies along the z axis with inter-dipole spacing a 
=  2λ.  At  what  angles  θ  in  the  y-z  plane  is  the  gain  maximum?    See  Figure  10.4.5  for  the 
geometry, but note that the dipoles for our problem are x-oriented rather than z-oriented.  What is 
the  angle  Δ  between  the  two  nulls  adjacent  to  θ ≅ π/2?  What  is  the  gain  difference  ΔG(dB) 
between  the  main  lobe  at  θ  =  π/2  and  its  immediately  adjacent  sidelobes?    What  difference  in 
excitation phase ψ between adjacent dipoles is required to scan these main lobes 10° to one side? 

Solution:	 The  gain  is  maximum  when  the  rays  from  adjacent  dipoles  add  in  phase,  and 
therefore  all  rays  add  in  phase.    This  occurs  at  θ =  0,  ± π 2 ,  and  ± sin −1 ( λ a ) ≅   30° 
[see  Figure  10.4.5(b)  for  the  approximate  geometry, where we want  a  phase  lag  of λ 
to  achieve  a  gain  maximum].    The  nulls  nearest  θ = π 2  occur  at  that  θfn  when  the 
rays  from  the  first  and  51st  dipoles  first  cancel  [see  text  after  (10.4.13)],  or  when

The  array  factors  for  this  problem  and  Figure  10.4.5(a)  are  the  same,  so  (10.4.10)

be  ignored  because  we  seek  only  gain  ratios.    We  define  β ≡ π 2 − θ   so  cos θ

10.4.5  Phasor addition in array antennas 

Phasor  addition  can  be  a  useful  tool  for  analyzing  antennas.   Consider  the  linear  dipole  array  of 
Figure  10.4.5,  which  consists  of  N  identical  z-oriented  dipole  antennas  spaced  at  distance  a 
equally along  the z-axis.  In direction θ from  the z axis  the array factor is the sum of the phasors 
emitted  from  each  dipole.    Figure  10.4.6(a)  shows  this  sum A  for  the  x-y  plane  (θ  =  90°) when 
the  dipoles  are  all  excited  in  phase  and  N  =  8.  This  yields  the maximum  possible  gain  for  this 
antenna.  As θ departs from 90° (broadside radiation) the phasors each rotate differently and add 
to  form  a  progressively  smaller  sum B.  When  the  total  phasor B  corresponds  to  Δφ  =  5-degree 
lag for each successive contribution, then θ =  cos−1 5  λ
) .  Figure 10.4.6(b, c, and d) show the
( 
360  a 
sum  B  when  Δφ  is  45°,  72°,  and  90°,  respectively.  The  antenna  gain  is  proportional  to  |B|2. 
Figures (b) and (d) correspond to radiation angles θ that yield nulls in the pattern (|B| = 0), while 
(c)  is  near  a  local  maximum  in  the  antenna  pattern.    Because  |C|  is  ~0.2|A|,  the  gain  of  this 
sidelobe  is  ~0.04  times  the  maximum  gain  (|C|2  ≅  0.04|A|2),  or  ~14  dB  weaker.54   The  spatial 
angles θ corresponding to (a) - (d) depend on the inter-dipole distance 'a'. 

If a = 2λ,  then angles θ  from  the z axis  that correspond  to phasor A  in Figure 10.4.7  (a) are 
0°,  60°,  90°,  120°,  and  180°;  the  peaks  at  0  and  180°  fall  on  the  null  of  the  element  factor  and 
can be ignored.  The angle from the array axis is θ, and 'a' is the element spacing, as illustrated in 
Figure  10.4.5.  The  angles  θ  =  0°  and  180°  correspond  to  cos-1  (2λ/2λ),  while  θ  =  60°  and  θ  = 
120°  correspond  to  cos-1(λ/2λ),  and  θ  =  90°  corresponds  to  cos-1  (0/2λ);  the  numerator  in  the 
argument  of  cos-1  is  the  lag  distance  in  direction  θ,  and  the  denominator  is  the  element  spacing 
'a'.    Thus  this  antenna  has  three  equal  peaks  in  gain:  θ  =  60,  90,  and  120°,  together  with 
numerous smaller sidelobes between those peaks. 

54 dB ≡ 10 log10N, so N = 0.04 corresponds to ~-14 dB.

Four  small  sidelobes  occur  between  the  adjacent  peaks  at  60°,  90°,  and  120°.  The  first 
sidelobe  occurs  in  each  case  for  φ ≅  70°  as  illustrated  in  Figure  10.4.2(c),  i.e.,  approximately 
half-way between  the nulls  at φ = 45° [Figure 10.4.2(b)]  and φ = 90°  [Figure 10.4.2(d)],  and  the 
second  sidelobe  occurs  for  φ ≅  135°,  between  the  nulls  for  φ  =  90°  [Figure  10.4.2(d)]  and  φ  = 
180° (not  illustrated).  Consider, for example,  the broadside main  lobe at θ = 90°; for  this case φ 
= 0°.  As θ decreases from 90° toward zero, φ increases toward 45°, where the first null occurs as 
shown  in  (b);  the  corresponding  θnull  =  cos-1[(φλ/360)/2λ]  =  86.4°.  The  denominator  2λ  in  the 
argument is again the inter-element spacing.  The first sidelobe occurs when φ ≅ 72° as shown in 
(c),  and  θ ≅  cos-1[(φλ/360)/2λ]  =  84.4°.  The  next  null  occurs  at  φ  =  90°  as  shown  in  (d),  and 
θnull  =  cos-1[(φλ/360)/2λ]  =  82.8°.  The  second  sidelobe  occurs  for  φ ≅  135°,  followed  by  a  null 
when  φ  =  180°.  The  third  and  fourth  sidelobes  occur  for  φ ≅  225°  and  290°  as  the  phasor 
patterns  repeat  in  reverse  sequence:  (d)  is  followed by  (c)  and  then  (b)  and  (a)  as θ  continues  to 
decline  toward  the  second  main  lobe  at  θ  =  60°.  The  entire  gain  pattern  thus  has  three  major 
peaks at 60, 90, and 120°, typically separated by four smaller sidelobes intervening between each 
major pair, and also grouped near θ = 0° and 180°. 

Example 10.4E 
What  is  the  gain GS  of  the  first  sidelobe  of  an  n-element  linear  dipole  array  relative  to  the main 
lobe Go as n → ∞? 

Solution:  Referring  to  Figure  10.4.7(c),  we  see  that  as  n→∞  the  first  sidelobe  has  an  electric 
n
field EffS that is the diameter of the circle formed by the n phasors when  ∑ i 1| E  |  = 
i 
= 
Effo  is  ~1.5  times  the  circumference  of  that  circle,  or  ~1.5×πEffS.  The  ratio  of  the 
gains is therefore GS/Go = |EffS/Effo|2 = (1/1.5π)2 = 0.045, or -13.5 dB.

10.4.6  Multi-beam antenna arrays 

Some  antenna  arrays  are  connected  so  as  to  produce  several  independent  beams  oriented  in 
different  directions  simultaneously;  phased  array  radar  antennas  and  cellular  telephone  base 
stations  are  common  examples.    When  multiple  antennas  are  used  for  reception,  each  can  be 
filtered  and  amplified  before  they  are  added  in  as  many  different  ways  as  desired.    Sometimes 
these combinations are predetermined and fixed, and sometimes  they are adjusted  in real  time  to 
place  nulls  on  sources  of  interference  or  to  place  maxima  on  transmitters  of  interest,  or  to  do 
both. 

The following cellular  telephone example  illustrates some of  the design  issues.   The driving 
issue here  is  the serious  limit  to network capacity  imposed by  the  limited bandwidth available at 
frequencies  suitable  for  urban  environments.    The  much  broader  spectrum  available  in  the 
centimeter  and  millimeter-wave  bands  propagates  primarily  line-of-sight  and  is  not  very  useful 
for  mobile  applications;  lower  frequencies  that  diffract  well  are  used  instead,  although  the 
available  bandwidth  is  less.    The  solution  is  to  reuse  the  same  low  frequencies  multiple  times, 
even within  the same small geographic area.   This is accomplished using array antennas that can 
have multiple inputs and outputs. 

A typical face of a cellular base station antenna has 3 or 4 elements that radiate only into the 
forward  half-space.  They  might  also  have  a  combining  circuit  that  forms  two  or  more  desired 
beams.   An  alternate way  to  use  these  arrays  based  on  switching  is  described  later.    Three  such 
faces,  such  as  those  illustrated  in  Figure  10.4.8(a)  with  four  elements  spaced  at  3λ,  might  be 
arranged in a triangle and produce two sets of antenna lobes, for example, the φ = 0 set and the φ 
= π set indicated in (b) by filled and dashed lines, respectively.

As before, φ  is  the phase angle difference  introduced between adjacent antenna elements.    Inter-
antenna separations of 3λ result in only 5 main lobes per face, because the two peaks in the plane

of  each  face  are  approximately  zero  for  typical  element  factors.    Between  each  pair  of  peaks 
there are two small sidelobes, approximately 14 dB weaker as shown above. 

These two sets (φ = 0, φ = π) can share the same frequencies because digital communication 
techniques can  tolerate overlapping  signals  if one  is more  than ~10-dB weaker.   Since each  face 
of  the  antenna  can  be  connected  simultaneously  to  two  independent  receivers  and  two 
independent  transmitters,  as  many  as  six  calls  could  simultaneously  use  the  same  frequency 
band,  two  per  face.    A  single  face  would  not  normally  simultaneously  transmit  and  receive  the 
same frequency, however.  The lobe positions can also be scanned in angle by varying φ so as to 
fill any nulls.  Designing such antennas to maximize frequency reuse requires care and should be 
tailored  to  the  distribution  of  users within  the  local  environment.    In  unobstructed  environments 
there  is  no  strong  limit  to  the  number  of  elements  and  independent  beams  that  can  be  used  per 
face, or to the degree of frequency reuse.  Moreover, half the beams could be polarized one way, 
say  right-circular  or  horizontal,  and  the  other  half  could  be  polarized  with  the  orthogonal 
polarization,  thereby  doubling  again  the  number  of  possible  users  of  the  same  frequencies. 
Polarization  diversity  works  poorly  for  cellular  phones,  however,  because  users  orient  their 
dipole antennas as they wish. 

In practice, most urban cellular towers do not currently phase their antennas as shown above 
because many environments  suffer  from  severe multipath effects where  reflected versions of  the 
same  signals  arrive  at  the  receiving  tower  from many  angles with varying delays.    The  result  is 
 
that  at  each  antenna  element  the  phasors  arriving  from  different  directions with  different  phases 
and amplitudes will add to produce a net signal amplitude that can be large or small.  As a result 
one  of  the  elements  facing  a  particular  direction  may  have  a  signal-to-interference  ratio  that  is 
more  than  10  dB  stronger  than  another  for  this  reason  alone,  even  though  the  antenna  elements 
are  only  a  few  wavelengths  away  in  an  obstacle-free  local  environment.    Signals  have  different 
differential  delays  at  different  frequencies  and  therefore  their  peak  summed  values  at  each 
antenna  element  are  frequency  dependent.    The  antenna-use  strategy  in  this  case  is  to  assign 
users  to  frequencies  and  single  elements  that  are  observed  to  be  strong  for  that  user,  so  that 
another  user  could  be  overlaid  on  the  same  frequency  while  using  a  different  antenna  element 
pointed  in  the  same direction.   The  same  frequency-reuse  strategy  also works when  transmitting 
because of reciprocity. 

That  signal  strengths  are  frequency  dependent  in  multipath  environments  is  easily  seen  by 
considering an antenna receiving both  the direct  line-of-sight signal with delay  t1 and a reflected 
second signal with comparable strength and delay t2.  If the differential lag c(t2 - t1) = nλ = D for 
integer  n,  then  the  two  signals will  add  in  phase  and  reinforce  each  other.    If  the  lag D  =  (2n  + 
1)λ/2, then they will partially or completely cancel.   If D = 10λ and  the frequency f  increases by 
10 percent, then the lag measured in wavelengths will also change 10 percent as the sum makes a 
full  peak-to-peak  cycle  with  a  null  between.    Thus  the  gap  between  frequency  nulls  is  ~Δf  = 
f(λ/D) =  c/D Hz.  The  depth  of  the  null  depends  on  the  relative magnitudes  of  the  two  rays  that 
interfere.  As the number of rays increases the frequency structure becomes more complex.  This 
phenomenon  of  signals  fading  in  frequency  and  time  as  paths  and  frequencies  change  is  called 
multipath fading.
