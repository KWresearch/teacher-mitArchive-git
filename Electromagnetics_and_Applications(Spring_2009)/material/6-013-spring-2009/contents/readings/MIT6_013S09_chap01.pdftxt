Fields

1.1.1 

Introduction 

Electromagnetics  involves  the  macroscopic  behavior  of  electric  charges  in  vacuum  and  matter. 
This behavior can be accurately characterized by the Lorentz force law and Maxwell’s equations, 
which  were  derived  from  experiments  showing  how  forces  on  charges  depend  on  the  relative 
locations  and  motions  of  other  charges  nearby.   Additional  relevant  laws  of  physics  include 
Newton’s  law,  photon  quantization,  and  the  conservation  relations  for  charge,  energy,  power, 
and  momentum.    Electromagnetic  phenomena  underlie  most  of  the  “electrical”  in  “electrical 
engineering” and are basic to a sound understanding of that discipline. 

Electrical  engineering  has  delivered  four  “miracles” —  sets  of  phenomena  that  could  each 
be considered  true magic prior  to  their development.   The first of  these  to  impress humanity was 
the  electrical  phenomenon  of  lightning,  often  believed  to  be  a  tool  of  heaven,  and  the  less 
powerful magnetic  force  that  caused  lodestones  to point north.   The  explanation  and  application 
of  these  invisible  forces  during  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries  vaulted  electrical 
engineering  to  the  forefront  of  commercial  interest  as  motors,  generators,  electric  lights, 
batteries, heaters, telephones, record players, and many other devices emerged. 

The  second  set  of  miracles  delivered  the  ability  to  communicate  instantly  without  wires 
around  the world,  not  only  dots  and  dashes,  but  also  voice,  images,  and  data.    Such  capabilities 
had  been  commonplace  in  fairy  tales,  but  were  beyond  human  reach  until  Hertz  demonstrated 
radiowave  transmission  in  1888,  15  years  after  Maxwell’s  predictions.    Marconi  extended  the 
technique to intercontinental distances. 

Third  came  electronics  and  photonics  —  the  ability  to  electrically  manipulate  individual 
electrons  and  atoms  in  vacuum  and  in matter  so  as  to  generate,  amplify, manipulate,  and  detect 
electromagnetic  signals.    During  the  twentieth  century  vacuum  tubes,  diodes,  transistors, 
integrated  circuits,  lasers,  and  superconductors  all  vastly  extended  the  capabilities  and 
applications of electromagnetics. 

The  fourth  set  of  electrical  phenomena  involves  cybernetics  and  informatics  —  the 
manipulation  of  electrical  signals  so  complex  that  entirely  new  classes  of  functionality  are 
obtained,  such  as  optimum  signal  processing,  computers,  robotics,  and  artificial  intelligence. 
This  text focuses on  the electromagnetic nature of  the first  three sets of phenomena and explores 
many of their most important applications. 

Chapter 1 of this text begins with a brief review of the underlying laws of physics, followed 
by  the  Lorentz  force  law  and  the  nature  of  electric  and  magnetic  fields.    Chapter  2  introduces 
electrodynamics  and Maxwell’s  equations,  leading  to  uniform  plane  waves  in  space  and media, 
and  definitions  of  power,  energy,  boundary  conditions,  and  uniqueness.    The  next  four  chapters 

- 11 -


address static and quasistatic systems beginning with Chapter 3, which explores electromagnetics 
in  the  context  of  RLC  circuits  and  devices.    Chapter  4  addresses  the  more  general  behavior  of 
quasistatic  electric  and  magnetic  fields  in  homogeneous  and  inhomogeneous  media.    Chapter  5 
introduces  electromagnetic  forces  while  Chapter  6  addresses  their  application  to  motors, 
generators, actuators, and sensors. 

The  second  half  of  the  text  focuses  on  electrodynamics  and  waves,  beginning  with  TEM 
transmission  lines  in  Chapters  7  and  8,  and  waves  in  media  and  at  boundaries  in  Chapter  9. 
Antennas and radiation are  treated  in Chapters 10 and 11, while optical and acoustic systems are 
addressed  in Chapters 12 and 13,  respectively.  Acoustics  is  introduced on  its own merits and as 
a  useful  way  to  review  electromagnetic  wave  phenomena  such  as  radiation  and  resonance  in  a 
more physical and familiar context.  The appendices list natural constants and review some of the 
prerequisite mathematics. 

The  rationalized  international  system  of  units  (rationalized  SI  units)  is  used,  which  largely 
avoids  factors of 4π.  SI units  emphasize meters  (m), kilograms  (kg),  seconds  (s), Amperes  (A), 
and Kelvins  (K); most other units can be expressed  in  terms of  these.   The SI system also  favors 
units  in  multiples  of  103;  for  example,  it  favors  meters  and  millimeters  over  centimeters.    The 
algebraic convention used here is that operations within parentheses are performed before others. 
Within  parentheses  and  exponents  and  elsewhere,  exponentiation  is  performed  first,  and 
multiplication before division; all these operations are performed before addition and subtraction. 

1.1.2  Review of basic physical concepts and definitions 

The  few  basic  concepts  summarized  below  are  central  to  electromagnetics.    These  concepts 
include  conservation  of  energy,  power,  and  charge,  and  the  notion  of  a  photon,  which  conveys 
one quantum of electromagnetic energy.    In addition, Newton’s  laws characterize  the kinematics 
of  charged  particles  and  objects  influenced  by  electromagnetic  fields.   The  conservation  laws 
also  follow  from Maxwell’s equations, which are presented  in Section 2.1 and,  together with  the 
Lorentz  force  law,  compress  all  macroscopic  electromagnetic  behavior  into  a  few  concise 
statements. 

This  text  neglects  relativistic  issues  introduced when  mass  approaches  the  velocity  of  light 
or  is converted  to or  from energy, and  therefore we have conservation of mass:  the  total mass m 
within a closed envelope remains constant. 

Conservation  of  energy  requires  that  the  total  energy  wT  [Joules]  remains  constant  within 
any  system  closed  so  that  no  power  enters  or  leaves,  even  though  the  form  of  the  internally 
stored  energy may  be  changing.   This  total  energy wT may  include  electric  energy we, magnetic 
energy  wm,  thermal  energy  wTh, mechanical  kinetic  energy  wk, mechanical  potential  energy  wp, 
and  energy  in  chemical,  atomic,  or  other  forms  wother;  wother  is  neglected  here.  Conservation  of 
energy means: 

wT = we + wm + wk + wp + wTh + wother [Joules] = constant 

(1.1.1)

In  this  text  we  generally  use  lower  case  letters  to  indicate  totals,  and  upper  case  letters  to 
indicate  densities.  Thus  we  represent  total  energy  by  wT  [J]  and  total  energy  density  by 
WT  [J m-3].  Similarly,  f  [N] denotes  the  total  force on an object and F  [N m-3] denotes  the  force 
density. 

Unfortunately  the number of electromagnetic variables  is so  large  that many  letters are used 
in multiple ways, and sometimes  the meaning must be extracted  from  the context.   For example, 
the symbol f is used to signify both force and frequency. 

Newton’s  law  says  that a one-Newton  force  f would  cause an otherwise  force-free kilogram 
mass  to  accelerate  at one meter per  second per  second;  this defines  the Newton.  One Newton  is 
roughly  the  terrestrial gravitational  force on a quarter-pound weight (e.g.  the weight of  the apple 
that  allegedly  fell  on Newton’s  head,  prompting  him  to  conceive  the  law  of  gravity).   Newton’s 
law may be expressed as: 

f  = ma  [Newtons] 

(1.1.2) 

where m is the mass of the object [kg] and a is the induced acceleration [ms-2]. 

The unit of energy,  the Joule,  is  the  total energy wT delivered  to an object when a force f of 
one Newton is applied to it as it moves one meter in the direction z of the force.  Therefore: 

f = dw T 
dz 

(1.1.3)

The kinetic energy wk of a mass m moving at velocity v is: 

wk =  1
2 mv2  [J] 
which, when  added  to  its potential  energy  wp,  equals  its  total  energy wT  relative  to  a motionless 
reference position; i.e.: 

(1.1.4) 

wT = wk + wp 

(1.1.5) 

It  is  easy  to  see  that  if wp  remains  constant,  then  (1.1.3)  and  (1.1.4)  are  consistent with  f  = ma; 
that is, f = dwT/dz = dwk/dz = mv dv/dz = m(dz/dt)(dv/dz) = m dv/dt = ma. 

Conservation  of  power means,  for  example,  that  the  total  power  Pin  [Js-1]  entering  a  closed 
volume must equal the rate of increase [Js-1] of the total energy stored there; that is: 
Pin [W] =  dw T  [Js-1] 
dt

(1.1.6)

where dwT/dt is the time derivative of wT, and the units [Joules per second] are often replaced by 
their  equivalent,  Watts  [W].    If  dwT/dt  =  0,  then  the  power  flowing  into  a  closed  volume  must 
equal  the  power  flowing  out  so  that  power  is  conserved.    These  laws  also  apply  to 

- 13 -


electromagnetic power and energy, and their definition in terms of electromagnetic fields appears 
in Section 2.7. 

In  mechanical  systems  one  watt  is  delivered  to  an  object  if  it  received  one  joule  in  one 
second.  More generally the mechanical power P delivered to an object is P = fv  [W], where f is 
the only force [N] acting on the object, and v [ms-1] is the object’s velocity in the same direction 
as the force vector⎯f.  More generally, 

P f v 
= • ≡ fv cos

θ [W ] 

(1.1.7)

where⎯v is the velocity vector and θ is the angle between  f  and  v . 

Conservation  of momentum  requires  that  the  total momentum  of  a  set  of  interacting masses 
mi  remains  constant  if  the  set  is  free  from  external  forces.   The  momentum  of  any  object  is  mv 
[kg ms-1], so in a force-free environment:

d (  m v
∑ i

(1.1.8)

 
= 0 

 

Conservation  of  charge  requires  that  the  total  electric  charge  Q  inside  any  volume  must 
remain  constant  if  no  net  charge  crosses  the  boundaries  of  that  volume.    This  is  analogous  to 
conservation of mass, although nuclear and other processes can convert mass m  to energy E and 
vice-versa  (E  =  mc2).  Charge  conservation,  however,  has  no  significant  exceptions.    Electric 
charge  is  generally  quantized  in  positive  or  negative  multiples  of  the  charge  e  on  an  electron, 
where: 

e = - 1.6021 × 10-19 Coulombs 

(1.1.9) 

The  unit  of  charge,  one  Coulomb,  is  the  charge  conveyed  by  one  Ampere  flowing  for  one 
second, where the Ampere is the unit of electric current. 

Photons  carry  the  smallest  unit  of  energy  that  can  be  conveyed  by  electromagnetic  waves. 
The energy E of a single photon is: 

E = hf  [J] 

(1.1.10) 

where h  is Planck’s  constant  (6.624×10-34  [J  s])  and  f  is  the photon  frequency  [Hz].   Sometimes 
it is more convenient to think of electromagnetic waves as continuous waves, and sometimes it is 
more  convenient  to  think  of  them  as  consisting  of  particles  (photons),  each  of  energy  E.    The 
total power P conveyed by an electromagnetic wave at  frequency  f  is  therefore  the number N of 
photons passing per second times the photon energy E: 

P = N hf  [W] 

(1.1.11) 

The frequency of a wave is simply related to its wavelength λ and the velocity of light c:

f = c/λ	

(1.1.12) 

Example 1.1A 
A  typical  fully  charged  1-kilowatt-hour  car  battery  can  accelerate  a  perfectly  efficient  1000-kg 
electric automobile to what maximum speed? 

Solution:	 The  battery  energy  we[J]  equals  1000  watts  times  3600  seconds  (one  kilowatt-hour). 
It  also  equals  the  maximum  kinetic  energy,  wk  =  mv2/2,  of  the  speeding  automobile 
(mass = m = 1000, velocity = v) after the battery is totally drained.  Therefore 
wk = 3.6×106 ⇒ v = (2wk/m)0.5 = (7.2×106/1000)0.5  ≅ 85 m s-1  ≅  190 mph. 

Example 1.1B 
A  sunny  day  delivers  ~1kw m-2;  to  how many  photons N  per  second  per  square meter  does  this 
correspond  if  we  (incorrectly)  assume  they  all  have  the  same  wavelength  λ  =  5×10-7  meters? 
(0.5 microns is in the visible band.)? 

Solution:  	 Power  =  Nhf  =  Nhc/λ  =  1  kw,  so  N  =  103λ/hc  ≅  103×5×10-7/(6.6×10-34×3×108)  ≅ 
2.5×1020 photons m-2s-1. 

1.2 

Forces and the measurement and nature of electromagnetic fields 

Electric  fields  E   and  magnetic  fields  H   are  manifest  only  by  the  forces  they  exert  on  free  or 
bound  electric  charges q  [Coulombs].   These  forces  are  completely  characterized by  the Lorentz 
force law: 

( + 
[  ] = q E  v × μ 
f N 
o H

)	

(Lorentz force law) 

(1.2.1) 

Thus we can define electric field⎯E (volts/meter) in terms of the observable force vector⎯f: 

E v/m ] 
[
= f  q	  

(electric field) 

(1.2.2)

for the special case of a charge q with velocity  v

0 .= 

Similarly  we  can  define  magnetic  field  H   [A  m-1]  in  terms  of  the  observed  force  vector⎯f 
given  by  the  Lorentz  force  equation  when  E 0 ;⎯H  can  be  sensed  only  by  charges  in  motion
= 
relative to the observer.  Although a single measurement of force on a motionless charge suffices 
to  determine⎯E,  measurements  of  two  charge  velocity  vectors  v   or  current  directions⎯I  are 
required  to  determine⎯H.  For  example,  the  arbitrary  test  charge  velocity  vector  xˆ v1  yields  f1  = 
qμov1H  sinθ, where  θ  is  the  angle  between⎯v  and⎯H  in  the  xˆ - yˆ   plane  (see  Figure  1.2.1).  The 
unit vector  yˆ   is defined as being  in  the observed direction⎯f1  ×⎯v1 where⎯f1 defines  the  zˆ   axis. 
A second measurement with the test charge velocity vector  yˆ v2 yields f2 = qμov2H cosθ.  If v1 = 

- 15 -


v2  then  the  force  ratio  f1/f2  =  tan  θ,  yielding  θ  within  the  xˆ - yˆ   plane,  plus  the  value  of  H:  H  = 
f1/(qμov1  sin  θ).  There  is  no  other  physical method  for  detecting  or measuring  static  electric  or 
magnetic fields; we can only measure the forces on charges or on charged bodies, or measure the 
consequences of that force, e.g., by measuring the resulting currents.

It  is  helpful  to  have  a  simple  physical  picture  of  how  fields  behave  so  that  their  form  and 
behavior  can  be  guessed  or  approximately  understood  without  recourse  to  mathematical 
solutions.  Such  physical  pictures  can  be  useful  even  if  they  are  completely  unrelated  to  reality, 
provided  that  they  predict  all  observations  in  a  simple  way.    Since  the  Lorentz  force  law  plus 
Maxwell’s  equations  explain  essentially  all  non-relativistic  and  non-quantum  electromagnetic 
behavior  in  a  simple  way  using  the  fields⎯E  and⎯H,  we  need  only  to  ascertain  how⎯E  and⎯H 
behave given a particular distribution of stationary or moving charges q. 

First  consider  static  distributions  of  charge.    Electric  field  lines  are  parallel  to⎯E,  and  the 
strength  of⎯E  is  proportional  to  the  density  of  those  field  lines.    Electric  field  lines  begin  on 
positive  charges  and  terminate  on  negative  ones,  and  the  more  charge  there  is,  the  more  field 
lines there are.  Field strength is proportional to lines per square meter.  These lines pull on those 
charges  to which  they  are  attached, whether  positive  or  negative, much  as would  a  rubber  band. 
Like rubber bands,  they would also  like  to  take  the shortest path between  two points, except  that 
they also tend to repel their neighbors laterally, as do the charges to which they are attached.

Figure 1.2.2  Electric field lines between two conducting cylinders. 
 

Figure  1.2.2  illustrates  the  results  of  this  mutual  field-line  repulsion,  even  as  they  pull  opposite 
charges  on  conducting  cylinders  toward  one  another.  Later we  shall  see  that  such  electric  field 

- 16 -


lines  are  always  perpendicular  to  perfectly  conducting  surfaces.    Although  these  lines  are 
illustrated as discrete, they actually are a continuum, even if only two charges are involved. 

The  same  intuition  applies  to  magnetic  field  lines⎯H.  For  example,  Figure  1.2.2  would 
apply  if  the  two cylinders corresponded  instead  to  the north  (+)  and  south  (-) poles of  a magnet, 
and  if⎯E became⎯H, although⎯H need not emerge perfectly perpendicular  to  the magnet surface. 
In  this  case  too  the  field  lines  would  physically  pull  the  two  magnet  poles  toward  one  another. 
Both electric and magnetic motors can be driven using either the attractive force along field lines 
or the lateral repulsive force between lines, depending on motor design, as discussed later. 

Another  intuitive  picture  applies  to  time-dependent  electromagnetic  waves,  where 
distributions of position-dependent electric and magnetic fields at right angles propagate as plane 
waves  in  the  direction⎯E  ×⎯H  much  like  a  rigid  body  at  the  speed  of  light  c,  ~3×108  m/s. 
Because electromagnetic waves can superimpose, it can be shown that any distribution of electric 
and  magnetic  fields  can  be  considered  merely  as  the  superposition  of  such  plane  waves.    Such 
plane waves  are  introduced  in  Section  2.2.    If we  examine  such  superpositions  on  spatial  scales 
small  compared  to  a  wavelength,  both  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  behave  much  as  they 
would in the static case. 

Example 1.2A 
A  typical  old  vacuum  tube  accelerates  electrons  in  a  ~104  v  m-1  electric  field.  What  is  the 
resulting  electron  velocity  v(t)  if  it  starts  from  rest?   How  long  (τ)  does  it  take  the  electron  to 
transit the 1-cm tube? 

Solution:  	 Force  f  = ma  =  qE,  and  so  v  =  at  =  qEt/m  ≅  1.6×10-19×104  t/(9.1×10-28)  ≅  1.8×1012  t 
[m  s-1].  Obviously v  cannot  exceed  the  speed of  light  c, ~3×108 m/s.    In  this  text we 
deal  only  with  non-relativistic  electrons  traveling  much  slower  than  c.    Distance 
traveled  =  d  =  aτ2/2  =  0.01,  so  the  transit  time  τ  =  (2d/a)0.5  =  (2dm/qE)0.5  ≅ 
[2×0.01×9.1×10-28/(1.6×10-19×104)]0.5  ≅  1.1×10-7  seconds.  This  slow  transit  limited 
most  vacuum  tubes  to  signal  frequencies  below  several  megahertz,  although  smaller 
gaps  and  higher  voltages  have  enabled  simple  tubes  to  reach  100  MHz  and  higher. 
The  microscopic  gaps  of  semiconductors  can  eliminate  transit  time  as  an  issue  for 
most  applications  below  1  GHz;  other  phenomena  often  determine  the  frequency 
range instead. 

1.3  Gauss’s Law and electrostatic fields and potentials 

While  the  Lorentz  force  law  defines  how  electric  and  magnetic  fields  can  be  observed, 
Maxwell’s  four  equations  explain  how  these  fields  can  be  created  directly  from  charges  and 
currents,  or  indirectly  and  equivalently  from  other  time  varying  fields.    One  of  those  four 
equations  is  Gauss’s  Law  for  charge,  which  states  that  the  total  charge  Q  [Coulombs]  within 
volume  V  equals  the  integral  of  the  normal  component  of  the  electric  displacement  vector⎯D 
over the surface area A of that volume:

In vacuum: 

D = εo E 

(1.3.2)
 

where  the  permittivity  of  vacuum  ε   =  8.854×10-12
  Farads/m.    Equation  (1.3.1)  reveals  the 
o
dimensions of⎯D: Coulombs/m2, often abbreviated here as [C/m2]. 

A few simple examples illustrate typical electric fields for common charge distributions, and 
how  Gauss’s  law  can  be  used  to  compute  those  fields.    First  consider  a  sphere  of  radius  R 
uniformly filled with charge of density ρo [C/m3], as illustrated in Figure 1.3.1(a).

The  symmetry of  the  solution must match  the  spherical  symmetry of  the problem,  so⎯E must be 
independent  of  θ  and  φ,  although  it  can  depend  on  radius  r.   This  symmetry  requires  that⎯E  be 
radial and, more particularly: 

⎯E(r,θ,φ) =  rE(r)

(1.3.3) 

We can find⎯E(r) by substituting  (1.3.3) into (1.3.1).  First consider r > R, for which (1.3.1) 
becomes:

(1.3.7) 

It  is  interesting  to  compare  this  dependence  of⎯E  on  r  with  that  for  cylindrical  geometries, 
which  are  also  illustrated  in  Figure  1.3.1.  We  assume  a  uniform  charge  density  of  ρo  within 
radius R, corresponding to Λ coulombs/meter.  Substitution of (1.3.4) into (1.3.1) yields: 

2πrWεo E(r)  = πR2ροW = ΛW  [C]  (r > R)

Inside the cylinder (r < R) the right-hand-side of (1.3.9) still applies, but with R2 replaced with r2, 
so⎯E(r) =  rˆ rρο/2εο instead. 

To  find  the  voltage  difference,  often  called  the  difference  in  electrical  potential  Φ  or  the 
potential  difference,  between  two  points  in  space  [V], we  can  simply  integrate  the  static  electric 
field⎯E• rˆ   [V/m]  along  the  field  line⎯E  connecting  them.   Thus  in  the  spherical  case  the voltage 
difference Φ(r1) - Φ(r2) between points at r1 and at r2 > r1 is: 

Φ(r1) - Φ(r2) =

If we want  to assign an absolute value  to electrical potential or voltage V at a given  location, we 
usually  define  the  potential Φ  to  be  zero  at  r2  = ∞,  so  a  spherical  charge Q  produces  an  electric 
potential Φ(r) for r > R which is: 

Φ(r) = Q/4πεor  [V] 

(1.3.11) 

The  same  computation  for  the  cylindrical  charge  of  Figure  1.3.1  and  the  field  of  (1.3.9)

(1.3.12) 

A  third  simple  geometry  is  that  of  charged  infinite  parallel  conducting  plates  separated  by 
distance  d,  where  the  inner-facing  surfaces  of  the  upper  and  lower  plates  have  surface  charge 
density  +ρs  and  -ρs  [C/m2],  respectively,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  1.3.2  for  finite  plates.    The 
uniformity  of  infinite  plates  with  respect  to  x,  y,  and  φ  requires  that  the  solution⎯E  also  be 
independent  of  x,  y,  and  φ.  The  symmetry  with  respect  to  φ  requires  that⎯E  point  in  the  ±z 
direction.  Gauss’s  law  (1.3.1)  then  requires  that⎯E  be  independent  of  z  because  the  integrals 
of⎯D  over  the  top  and  bottom  surfaces  of  any  rectangular  volume  located  between  the  plates 
must cancel since there is no charge within such a volume and no⎯D passing through its sides.

This solution  for⎯E  is consistent with  the rubber-band model  for  field  lines, which suggests 
that  the  excess  positive  and  negative  charges  will  be  mutually  attracted,  and  therefore  will  be 
pulled to the inner surfaces of the two plates, particularly if the gap d between the plates is small 
compared  to  their  width.    Gauss’s  Law  (1.3.1)  also  tells  us  that  the  displacement  vector⎯D 
integrated  over  a  surface  enclosing  the  entire  structure  must  be  zero  because  the  integrated 
charge  within  that  surface  is  zero;  that  is,  the  integrated  positive  charge,  ρsA,  balances  the 
integrated  negative  charge,  - ρsA  and⎯D  external  to  the  device  can  be  zero  everywhere.    The 
electric potential difference V between the two plates can be found by integrating⎯E between the 
two plates.  That is, V = Eod volts for any path of integration, where Eo = ρs/εo by Gauss’s law. 

Although  the  voltage  difference  between  equipotentials  can  be  computed  by  integrating 
along the electric field lines themselves, as done above, it is easy to show that the result does not 
 
depend on the path of integration.  Assume there are two different paths of integration P1 and P2 
between any  two points of  interest, and  that  the  two  resulting voltage differences are V1 and V2. 
Now  consider  the  closed  contour  C  of  integration  that  is  along  path  P1  in  the  positive  direction 
and  along  P2  in  the  reverse  direction  so  as  to  make  a  closed  loop.    Since  this  contour  integral 
must yield zero, as  shown below  in  (1.3.13) using Faraday’s  law  for  the  static case where ∂/∂t = 
0, it follows that V1 = V2 and that all paths of integration yield the same voltage difference.

In  summary,  electric  fields  decay  as  1/r2  from  spherical  charge  concentrations,  as  1/r  from 
cylindrical  ones,  and  are  uniform  in  planar  geometries.    The  corresponding  electric  potentials 
decay  as  1/r,  -ln  r,  and  x,  respectively,  as  a  result  of  integration  over  distance.    The  potential Φ 
for  the  cylindrical  case  becomes  infinite  as  r→∞  because  the  cylinder  is  infinitely  long;  the 
expression  for  the  potential  difference  between  concentric  cylinders  of  finite  radius  is  valid, 
however.  Within  both  uniform  spherical  and  cylindrical  charge  distributions  the  electric  field 
increases from zero linearly with radius r.  In each case the electric field distribution is explained 
by  the rubber-band model  in which  the rubber bands (field  lines) repel each other  laterally while 
being pulled on by opposite electric charges. 

It  is  extremely  useful  to  note  that  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  so  that  superposition 
applies.  That is, the total electric field⎯E equals that due to the sum of all charges present, where 
the  contribution  to⎯E  from  each  charge  Q  is  given  by  (1.3.5).    Electric  potentials  Φ  also 
superimpose, where the contribution from each charge Q is given by (1.3.11).

Ampere’s Law and magnetostatic fields 

The  relevant  Maxwell’s  equation  for  static  current  densities⎯J  [A/m2]  is  Ampere’s  law,  which 
says that for time-invariant cases the integral of magnetic field⎯H around any closed contour in a 
right-hand  sense  equals  the  area  integral  of  current  density⎯J  [A/m2]  flowing  through  that 
contour:

Figure  1.4.1  illustrates  a  simple  cylindrical  geometry  for  which  we  can  readily  compute⎯H 
produced  by  current  I;  the  radius  of  the  cylinder  is  R  and  the  uniform  current  density  flowing 
through it is Jo [A/m2].  The cylinder is infinitely long.

Because  the  problem  is  cylindrically  symmetric  (not  a  function  of  θ),  and  uniform  with 
respect  to  the  cylindrical  axis  z,  so  is  the  solution.  Thus⎯H  depends  only  upon  radius  r. 
Substitution of⎯H(r) into (1.4.1) yields:

where  the  total  current  I  is  simply  the  uniform  current  density  Jo  times  the  area  πR2  of  the 
cylinder.  The  left-hand-side of  (1.4.2)  simply  equals H(r)  times  the  circumference of  a  circle of 
radius r, so (1.4.2) becomes:

(1.4.3)

(1.4.4)

(1.4.5) 

Therefore  H(r)  increases  linearly  with  r  within  the  wire  and  current  distribution,  and  is 
continuous at r = R, where both (1.4.3) and (1.4.5) agree that H(r) = JoR/2. 

Another  simple  geometry  involves  parallel  plates.    Assume  equal  and  opposite  current 
densities, Js [A/m], flow in infinite parallel plates separated by distance d, as illustrated in Figure 
1.4.2  for  finite  plates. The  integral  of Ampere’s  law  (1.4.1)  around  any  contour C1  circling  both 
plates  is  zero  because  the  net  current  through  that  contour  is  zero.    A  non-zero  integral  would 
require  an  external  source  of  field,  which  we  assume  does  not  exist  here.    Thus⎯H  above  and 
below  the  plates  is  zero.  Since  the  integral  of  (1.4.1)  around  any  contour  C2  that  circles  the 
upper  plate  yields HxW  =  JsW, where  the  x  component  of  the magnetic  field  anywhere  between 
the plates is Hx = Js [A/m]; thus the magnetic field⎯H between the plates is uniform.  An integral 
around  any  contour  in  any  y-z  plane  would  circle  no  net  current,  so  Hz  =  0,  and  a  similar 
argument  applies  to  Hy,  which  is  also  zero.  This  configuration  is  discussed  further  in  Section 
3.2.1.

More  generally,  because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  the  total  magnetic  field⎯H  at  any 
location  is  the  integral of contributions made by current densities⎯J nearby.  Section 10.1 proves 
the  Biot-Savart  law  (1.4.6),  which  defines  how  a  current  distribution⎯J'  at  position⎯r'  within 
volume V' contributes to⎯H at position⎯r: 

H( r, t) =

(1.4.6)

To  summarize,  electric  and  magnetic  fields  are  simple  fictions  that  explain  all 
electromagnetic  behavior  as  characterized  by  Maxwell’s  equations  and  the  Lorentz  force  law, 
which  are  examined  further  in  Chapter  2.    A  simple  physical  model  for  the  static  behavior  of 
 
electric  fields  is  that  of  rubber  bands  that  tend  to  pull  opposite  electric  charges  toward  one 
another,  but  that  tend  to  repel  neighboring  field  lines  laterally.    Static  magnetic  fields  behave 
similarly,  except  that  the  role  of  magnetic  charges  (which  have  not  been  shown  to  exist)  is 
replaced by current loops acting as magnetic dipoles in ways that are discussed later.
