Introduction 

∇ ×  E = 0

(4.1.1) 

Static  electric  and  magnetic  fields  are  governed  by  the  static  forms  of  Maxwell’s  equations  in 
differential and integral form for which ∂/∂t → 0:

As  shown  in  (1.3.5),  Gauss’s  law  (4.1.3)  leads  to  the  result  that  a  single  point  charge  Q  at  the 
origin in vacuum yields produces an electric field at radius r of: 

⎯E(r) =  rˆ Q/4πεor2 

(4.1.5) 

Superposition  of  such  contributions  to  E( r )   from  a  charge  distribution  ρ( r ')   located within  the

Any  static  electric  field  can  be  related  to  an  electric  potential  distribution Φ[volts]  because 
∇ ×⎯E = 0  implies⎯E = -∇Φ, where the voltage difference between two points (1.3.12) is:

(4.1.8) 

Similarly,  in  current-free  regions  of  space ∇  ×⎯H  =  0  implies⎯H  =  -∇Ψ [Amperes], where Ψ  is 
magnetic potential.  Therefore the magnetic potential difference between two points is:

(4.1.9) 

This definition of magnetic potential is useful in understanding the magnetic circuits discussed in 
Section 4.4.3. 

Often  not  all  source  charges  and  currents  are  given  because  some  reside  on  given 
equipotential  surfaces  and  assume  an  unknown  distribution  consistent  with  that  constraint.    To 
address  this  case,  Maxwell’s  equations  can  be  simply  manipulated  to  form  Laplace’s  equation, 
which can sometimes be solved by separation of variables, as discussed in Section 4.5, or usually 
by numerical methods.   Section 4.6  then discusses  the utility of  flux  tubes and  field mapping  for 
understanding static field distributions. 

Quasistatics assumes  that  the field strengths change so slowly  that  the electric and magnetic 
fields  induced  by  those  changes  (the  contributions  to⎯E  and⎯H  from  the  ∂/∂t  terms  in Faraday’s 
and  Ampere’s  laws)  are  sufficiently  small  that  their  own  induced  fields  (∝(∂/∂t)2)  can  be 
neglected;  only  the  original  and  first-order  induced  fields  are  therefore  of  interest.    Quasistatic 
examples were discussed  in Chapter 3  in  the context of  resistors, capacitors, and  inductors.   The 
mirror  image  technique  described  in  Section  4.2  is  used  for  static,  quasistatic,  and  dynamic 
problems  and  incidentally  in  the  discussion  in  Section  4.3  concerning  exponential  relaxation  of 
field strengths in conducting media and skin depth. 

4.2  Mirror image charges and currents 

One  very  useful  problem  solving  technique  is  to  change  the  problem  definition  to  one  that  is 
easier  to solve but  is known  to have  the same answer.   An excellent example of  this approach  is 
the use of mirror-image charges and currents, which also works for wave problems.10

Consider  the problem of  finding  the  fields produced by  a  charge  located  a distance d  above 
an  infinite  perfectly  conducting  plane,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  4.2.1(a).    Boundary  conditions  at 
the conductor  require only  that  the electric  field  lines be perpendicular  to  its  surface.   Any other 
set of boundary conditions  that  imposes  the same constraint must yield  the same unique solution 
by virtue of the uniqueness theorem of Section 2.8. 

One  such  set  of  equivalent  boundary  conditions  invokes  a  duplicate mirror  image  charge  a 
 
distance 2d away  from  the original charge and of opposite sign;  the conductor  is  removed.    The 
symmetry  for  equal  and  opposite  charges  requires  the  electric  field  lines  E   to  be  perpendicular 
to the original surface of the conductor at z = 0; this results in  E  being exactly as it was for z > 0 
when the conductor was present, as illustrated in Figure 4.2.1(b).  Therefore uniqueness says that 
above the half-plane the fields produced by the original charge plus its mirror image are identical 
to  those  of  the  original  problem.    The  fields  below  the  original  half  plane  are  clearly  different, 
but they are not relevant to the original problem. 

This  equivalence  applies  for  multiple  charges  or  for  a  charge  distribution,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure 4.2.2.  In fact the mirror image method remains valid so long as the charges change value 
or  position  slowly  with  respect  to  the  relaxation  time  ε/σ  of  the  conductor,  as  discussed  in 
Section  4.4.1.  The  relaxation  time  is  the  1/e  time  constant  required  for  the  charges  within  the 
conductor  to  approach  new  equilibrium  positions  after  the  source  charge  distribution  outside 
changes.

Because  the  mirror  image  method  works  for  varying  or  moving  charges,  it  works  for  the 
currents  that  must  be  associated  with  them  by  conservation  of  charge  (2.1.21),  as  suggested  in 
Figure 4.2.3 (a) and (b).  Figure 4.2.3(d) also suggests how the magnetic fields produced by these 
currents  satisfy  the  boundary  conditions  for  the  conducting  plane:  at  the  surface  of  a  perfect 
conductor⎯H is only parallel. 

The mirror  image method continues  to work  if the upper half plane contains a conductor, as 
illustrated  in  Figure  4.2.4;  the  conductor must  be  imaged  too.    These  conductors  can  even  be  at 
angles,  as  suggested  in  Figure  4.2.4(b).    The  region  over  which  the  deduced  fields  are  valid  is 
naturally  restricted  to  the  original  opening  between  the  conductors.    Still  more  complex  image

configurations  can  be  used  for  other  conductor  placements,  and  may  even  involve  an  infinite 
series of progressively smaller image charges and currents.

Relaxation of fields, skin depth 

4.3.1  Relaxation of electric fields and charge in conducting media 

Electric  and  magnetic  fields  established  in  conducting  time-invariant  homogeneous  media  tend 
to  decay  exponentially  unless  maintained.    Under  the  quasistatic  assumption  all  time  variations 
are  sufficiently  slow  that  contributions  to  E   by  B t
 are  negligible,  which  avoids  wave-like
∂ ∂
behavior and simplifies the problem.  This relaxation process is governed by the conservation-of­
charge relation (2.1.21), Gauss’s law  ( • = ) , and Ohm’s law  (
σE ) :

J =

t = 0 = ∇ •  ( σ  E ) +  ( ∂ ∂  t ) (∇ • ε  E ) = ∇ •  ⎡⎣( σ + ε∂ ∂  t ) E ⎤ =⎦  0 
J 
∇ •   + ∂ρ ∂  

(4.3.1)

Since  an  arbitrary  E   can  be  established  by  initial  conditions,  the  general  solution  to  (4.3.1) 
requires  ( σ + ε∂  ∂  t ) ∇iE = 0 , leading to the differential equation: 

( ∂ ∂  + σ ε  )	 ρ =
t

0

(4.3.2)

where  ∇ • E = ρ ε .  This  has  the  solution  that  ρ ( r )   relaxes  exponentially  with  a  charge 
relaxation time constant τ = ε/σ seconds: 

 ( )o r e−σ  t ε   = ρ
t m⎡⎣ -3
 ( )o r e− τ

⎤⎦	

 

 (charge relaxation) 

(4.3.3) 

It  follows  that  an  arbitrary  initial  electric  field  E r( )   in  a  medium  having  uniform  ε  and  σ 
will also decay exponentially with the same time constant ε/σ because Gauss’s law relates  E  and  
ρ linearly: 

∇ • E = ρ  ( )t  ε	

(4.3.4)
 

where  ∇ •E o  ≡ ρ  o  ε .  Therefore electric field relaxation is characterized by: 

E r(  , t  ) = Eo ( )r e−σ   ε  
⎡⎣ m  -1
t 
⎤⎦	
  v  

 

(electric field relaxation) 

(4.3.5) 

We  should  expect  such  exponential  decay  because  any  electric  fields  in  a  conductor  will 
generate  currents  and  therefore  dissipate  power  proportional  to  J2  and  E2.  But  the  stored 
electrical  energy  is  also  proportional  to  E2,  and  power  dissipation  is  the  negative  derivative  of 
stored energy.  That is, the energy decays at a rate proportional to its present value, which results 
in exponential decay.  In copper τ = εo/σ ≅ 9×10-12/(5×107) ≅ 2×10-19 seconds, short compared to 
any  delay  of  common  interest.    The  special  case  of  parallel-plate  resistors  and  capacitors  is 
discussed in Section 3.1. 

Example 4.3A 
What are the electric field relaxation time constants τ for sea water (ε ≅ 80εo, σ ≅ 4) and dry soil 
(ε ≅ 2εo, σ ≅ 10-5)?  For what radio frequencies can they be considered good conductors? 

Solution:  	 Equation  (4.3.5)  yields  τ  =  ε/σ ≅  (80×8.8×10-12)/4  ≅  1.8×10-10  seconds  for  seawater, 
and  (2×8.8×10-12)/10-5  ≅ 1.8×10-6 seconds  for dry soil.  So  long as  E  changes slowly 
with  respect  to  τ,  the medium  has  time  to  cancel  E ;  frequencies  below  ~5  GHz  and 
~500  kHz  have  this  property  for  seawater  and  typical  dry  soil,  respectively,  which 
behave  like  good  conductors  at  these  lower  frequencies.    Moist  soil  behaves  like  a 
conductor up to ~5 MHz and higher.

4.3.2  Relaxation of magnetic fields in conducting media 

Magnetic  fields  and  their  induced  currents  similarly  decay  exponentially  in  conducting  media 
unless  they  are  externally  maintained;  this  decay  process  is  often  called  magnetic  diffusion  or 
magnetic  relaxation.  We assume  that  the  time variations are  sufficiently  slow  that contributions 
∂  are negligible.  In this limit Ampere’s law becomes:

Thus the lifetime of magnetic field distributions in conducting media increases with permeability 
(energy  storage  density),  conductivity  (reducing  dissipation  for  a  given  current),  and  the 
wavelength squared (λ = 2π/k). 

4.3.3 

Induced currents 

Quasistatic  magnetic  fields  induce  electric  fields  by  virtue  of  Faraday’s  law:  ∇ × E  =  -μ∂H/ ∂ t . 
In conductors  these  induced electric fields drive currents  that obey Lenz’s  law: “The direction of 
induced  currents  tends  to  oppose  changes  in  magnetic  flux.” 
Induced  currents  find  wide 
application,  for example,  in: 1) heating, as  in  induction  furnaces  that melt metals, 2) mechanical 
actuation,  as  in  induction  motors  and  impulse  generators,  and  3)  electromagnetic  shielding.    In 
some  cases  these  induced  currents  are  undesirable  and  are  inhibited  by  subdividing  the 
conductors  into elements separated by  thin  insulating barriers.   All  these examples are discussed 
below.

First  consider  a  simple  conducting hollow  cylinder of  length W driven  circumferentially by 
current Iou(t), as illustrated in Figure 4.3.1, where u(t) is the unit step function (the current is zero 
until  t = 0, when  it becomes  Io).   Centered  in  the outer cylinder  is an  isolated second cylinder of 
conductivity σ and having a thin wall of thickness δ; its length and diameter are W and D << W, 
respectively.

Figure 4.3.1  Relaxation penetration of a magnetic field into a conducting cylinder. 
 

If the inner cylinder were a perfect conductor, then the current Iou(t) would produce an equal 
and  opposite  image  current  ~-Iou(t)  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  inner  cylinder,  thus  producing  a 
net zero magnetic field inside the cylinder formed by that image current.  Consider the integral of 
H d s around  a  closed  contour C1  that  threads both  cylinders  and  circles  zero net  current  at  t = 
• 
0+;  this  integral  yields  zero.  If  the  inner  conductor  were  slightly  resistive,  then  the  same  equal 
and  opposite  current  would  flow  on  the  inner  cylinder,  but  it  would  slowly  dissipate  heat  until 
the  image  current  decayed  to  zero  and  the  magnetic  field  inside  reached  the  maximum  value 
Io/W [A m-1] associated with the outer current Io.  These conclusions are quantified below. 

The magnetic  field H  inside  the  inner  cylinder  depends  on  the  currents  flowing  in  the  outer 
and inner cylinders, Io and I(t), respectively: 

H(t) = u(t)[Io + I(t)]/W 

(4.3.11) 

The  current  I(t)  flowing  in  the  inner  cylinder  is  driven  by  the  voltage  induced  by  H(t)  via 
Faraday’s law (2.4.14): 
(cid:118)∫C2 
where the contour C2 is in the x-y plane and circles the inner cylinder with diameter D.  The area 
circled  by  the  contour  A  =  πD2/4.  The  circumferential  resistance  of  the  inner  cylinder  is  R  =

πD/σδW  ohms.    For  simplicity  we  assume  that  the  permeability  here  is  μo  everywhere. 
Substituting (4.3.11) into (4.3.12) yields a differential equation for I(t): 

I(t) = - (μoA/WR) dI/dt 

Substituting the general solution I(t) = Ke-t/τ into (4.3.13) yields: 

Ke-t/τ = (μoA/WRτ)Ke-t/τ 

(4.3.13) 

(4.3.14) 

τ = μoA/WR = μoAσδ/πD  [s] 

(magnetic relaxation time) 

(4.3.15) 

Thus the greater the conductivity of the inner cylinder, and the larger its product μA, the longer it 
takes  for  transient magnetic  fields  to  penetrate  it.   For  the  special  case where δ = D/4π  and A = 
D2,  we  find  τ  =  μoσ(D/2π)2,  which  is  the  same  magnetic  relaxation  time  constant  derived  in 
(4.3.10)  if  we  identify  D  with  the  wavelength  λ  of  the  magnetic  field  variations.    Equation 
(4.3.15) is also approximately correct if μo → μ for the inner cylinder. 

Since  H(t)  =  0  at  t  =  0+,  (4.3.11)  yields  I(t  =  0+)  =  -  Io,  and  the  solution  I(t)  =  Ke-t/τ 
becomes: 

I(t) = - Io e-t/τ  [A] 

The magnetic field inside the inner cylinder follows from (4.3.16) and (4.3.11): 

H(t) = u(t)Io (1 - e-t/τ)/W  [A m-1] 

(4.3.16) 

(4.3.17) 

The  geometry  of  Figure  4.3.1  can  be  used  to  heat  resistive  materials  such  as  metals 
electrically by placing the metals in a ceramic container that sinusoidal magnetic fields penetrate 
easily.  The  induced  currents  can  then  melt  the  material  quicker  by  heating  the  material 
throughout  rather  than  just  at  the  surface,  as would  a  flame.   The  frequency  f  generally must  be 
sufficiently low that the magnetic fields penetrate a significant fraction of the container diameter; 
f << 1/τ. 

The  inner  cylinder  of  Figure  4.3.1  can  also  be  used  to  shield  its  interior  from  alternating 
magnetic  fields  by  designing  it  so  that  its  time  constant  τ  is much  greater  than  the  period  of  the 
undesired AC  signal;  large  values  of μσδ  facilitate  this  since  τ = μoAσδ/πD  (4.3.15).  Since we 
can model  a  solid  inner  cylinder  as  a  continuum  of  concentric  thin  conducting  shells,  it  follows 
that the inner shells will begin to see significant magnetic fields only after the surrounding shells 
do, and therefore the time delay experienced increases with depth.  This is consistent with τ ∝ δ. 
The  penetration  of  alternating  fields  into  conducting  surfaces  is  discussed  further  in  Section  9.3 
in terms of the exponential penetration skin depth δ =  2/ωμσ  [m]. 

Two  actuator  configurations  are  suggested  by  Figure  4.3.1.    First,  the  inner  cylinder  could 
be inserted only part way into the outer cylinder.  Then the net force on the inner cylinder would 
expel  it when  the outer  cylinder was  energized because  the polarity of  these  two  electromagnets 

- 108 -


are  reversed,  the  outer  one  powered  by  Io  and  the  inner  one  by    -  Io(1  -  e-t/τ).  Electromagnetic 
forces are discussed more fully  in Chapter 5; here it suffices to note that induced currents can be 
used  to  simplify  electromechanical  actuators.    A  similar  “kick”  can  be  applied  to  a  flat  plate 
placed  across  the  end  of  the  outer  cylinder,  for  again  the  induced  cylindrically  shaped  mirror 
image  current  would  experience  a  transient  repulsive  force.  Mirror-image  currents  were 
discussed in Section 4.2. 

The  inner  cores  in  transformers  and  some  inductors  are  typically  iron  and  are  circled  by 
wires  carrying  alternating  currents,  as  discussed  in  Section  3.2.    The  alternating  currents  induce 
circular currents in the core called eddy currents that dissipate power.  To minimize such induced 
currents  and  losses,  high-μ  conducting  cores  are  commonly  composed  of  many  thin  sheets 
separated  from  each  other  by  thin  coats  of  varnish  or  other  insulator  that  largely  blocks  those 
induced  currents;  these  are  called  laminated  cores.  A  rough  estimate  of  the  effectiveness  of 
using  N  plates  instead  of  one  can  be  obtained  by  noting  that  the  power  Pd  dissipated  in  each 
lamination  is proportional  to V2/R, where  V = (cid:118)∫C
E • ds  is  the  loop voltage  induced by H(t)  and 
R  is  the  effective  resistance  of  that  loop.   By  design H(t)  usually  penetrates  the  full  transformer 
core.  Thus  V  is  roughly  proportional  to  the  area  of  each  lamination  in  the  plane  perpendicular 
to⎯H, which  decreases  as  1/N.  The  resistance R  experienced  by  the  induced  current  circulating 
in  each  lamination  increases  roughly  by  N  since  the  width  of  the  channel  through  which  it  can 
flow  is  reduced  as  N  increases  while  the  length  of  the  channel  changes  only  moderately.    The 
total power dissipated  for N  laminations  is  thus  roughly proportional  to NV2/R ∝ NN-2/N = N-2. 
Therefore  we  need  only  increase  N  to  the  point  where  the  power  loss  is  tolerable  and  the 
penetration of the transformer core by H(t) is nearly complete each period. 

Example 4.3B 
How  long  does  it  take  a magnetic  field  to  penetrate  a  1-mm  thick metal  cylinder  of  diameter D 
with  conductivity 5×107  [S/m]  if μ = μo?   Design  a  shield  for  a ~10-cm  computer  that blocks 1­
MHz magnetic fields emanating from an AM radio. 

Solution:  	 If we assume the geometry of Figure 4.3.1 and use (4.3.15), τ = μoAσδ/πD, we find τ 
= 1.3×10-6×D×5×107×10-3/4 = 0.016D seconds, where A = πD2/4 and δ =  10-3.  If D 
 
= 0.1, then τ = 1.6×10-2 seconds, which is ~105 longer than the rise time ~10-6/2π of a 
1-MHz signal.    If a smaller  ratio of 102  is sufficient,  then a one-micron  thick  layer of 
metal evaporated on thin plastic might suffice.  If the metal had μ = 104μo, then a one-
micron thick layer would provide a safety factor of 106.

Static fields in inhomogeneous materials 

4.4.1 

Static electric fields in inhomogeneous materials 

Many practical problems  involve  inhomogeneous media where  the boundaries may be abrupt, as 
in  most  capacitors  or  motors,  or  graded,  as  in  many  semiconductor  or  optoelectronic  devices. 
The basic issues are well illustrated by the static cases discussed below.  Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 
discuss  static  electric  and  magnetic  fields,  respectively,  in  inhomogeneous  media.    To  simplify 

- 109 -


the discussion, only media characterized by  real scalar values  for ε, μ, and σ will be considered, 
where all three properties can be a function of position. 

Static  electric  fields  in  all media  are governed by  the  static  forms of Faraday’s  and Gauss’s 
laws: 

∇ × E = 0

∇ • D = ρ  f 

and by the constitutive relations: 

D = εE = εo E + P 

J = σE 

(4.4.1)

(4.4.2)
 

(4.4.3)
 

(4.4.4)
 

A  few  simple  cases  illustrate  how  these  laws  can  be  used  to  characterize  inhomogeneous 
conductors  and  dielectrics.  Perhaps  the  simplest  case  is  that  of  a  wire  or  other  conducting 
structure  (1)  imbedded  in  a  perfectly  insulating  medium  (2)  having  conductivity  σ  =  0.  Since 
charge  is conserved,  the perpendicular components of current must be  the  same on both  sides of 
the  boundary  so  that  J1⊥  =  J2⊥  =  0  =  E2⊥.  Therefore  all  currents  in  the  conducting  medium  are 
trapped within it and at the surface must flow parallel to that surface. 

Let’s consider next the simple case of an inhomogeneous slab between two parallel perfectly 
conducting plates spaced L apart in the x direction at a potential difference of Vo volts, where the 
terminal  at  x  =  0  has  the  greater  voltage.    Suppose  that  the  medium  has  permittivity  ε,  current 
density Jo, and inhomogeneous conductivity σ(x), where: 

σ = σ  o

free surface charge ρs at  the discontinuity.  Although  inhomogeneous conductors have a net  free 
charge  density  throughout  the  volume,  they may  or may  not  also  have  a  net  polarization  charge

(4.4.13) 

A  similar  series  of  computations  readily  handles  the  case  where  both  ε  and  σ  are 
inhomogeneous. 

Example 4.4A 
A certain capacitor consists of  two parallel conducting plates, one at z = 0 and +V volts and one 
at  z  =  d  and  zero  volts.    They  are  separated  by  a  dielectric  slab  of  permittivity  ε,  for  which  the 
conductivity  is small and different  in  the  two halves of  the dielectric, each of which  is d/2  thick; 
σ1  =  3σ2.  Assume  the  interface  between  σ1  and  σ2  is  parallel  to  the  capacitor  plates  and  is 

- 111 -



located at z = 0.  What is the free charge density ρf(z) in the dielectric, and what is  E ( )z  where z 
is the coordinate perpendicular to the plates? 

Solution:	 Since  charge  is  conserved,  J1 = J 2  = σ
2 E 2 ,  so  E 2  = σ1E1  σ2  = 3E 1 .  But 
1E1 = σ

.  The  free  charge  at  the  dielectric  interface  is ρs  (z  =  d/2)  = 
= 
D2  - D1 = ε(E2  - E1) = εV/d.  Charge can accumulate at all  three surfaces because  the 
dielectric  conducts.  The  net  charge  is  zero.    The  electric  field  between  capacitor 
plates was discussed in Section 3.1.2. 

4.4.2 

Static magnetic fields in inhomogeneous materials 

Static magnetic  fields  in most media  are  governed  by  the  static  forms  of Ampere’s  and Gauss’s 
laws: 

∇ × H = 0	

∇ • B = 0	

and by the constitutive relations: 

B = μH = μ (o  H + M )

(4.4.14)

(4.4.15)

(4.4.16) 

One simple case  illustrates how  these  laws characterize  inhomogeneous magnetic materials. 
Consider a magnetic material  that  is characterized by μ(x) and has an  imposed magnetic  field⎯B 
in the x direction.  Since  ∇ • B = 0  it follows that  B  is constant  ( Bo ) throughout, and that⎯H is a 
function of x: 

BH = 
o	
μ(x )  

(4.4.17)

As  a  result,  higher-permeability  regions  of  magnetic  materials  generally  host  weaker  magnetic 
fields  H ,  as  shown  in  Section  3.2.2  for  the  toroidal  inductors  with  gaps.    In  many  magnetic 
devices μ might vary four to six orders of magnitude, as would  H . 

4.4.3  Electric and magnetic flux trapping in inhomogeneous systems 

Currents  generally  flow  in  conductors  that  control  the  spatial  distribution  of⎯J  and  electric 
potential  Φ ( )r  .  Similarly,  high-permeability  materials  with  μ  >>  μo  can  be  used  to  form 

- 112 -


	
magnetic  circuits  that  guide⎯B  and  control  the  spatial  form  of  the  static  curl-free  magnetic 
potential  Ψ ( )r . 

Faraday’s law says that static electric fields⎯E are curl-free: 

∇ ×  E = −  ∂B  = 0  
∂t 

(Faraday’s law) 

(4.4.18)

Since ∇ ×⎯E = 0 in static cases, it follows that: 

⎯E = -∇Φ 

(4.4.19) 

where Φ is the electric potential [volts] as a function of position  in space.  But Gauss’s  law says 
∇iE = ρ/ε  in regions where ρ is constant.  Therefore ∇ •⎯E = -∇2Φ = ρ/ε and: 

ρ
2 
∇ Φ = −    
ε

(Laplace’s equation) 

(4.4.20)

In  static  current-free  regions  of  space  with  constant  permeability  μ,  Ampere’s  law  (2.1.6) 
says: 

∇ ×⎯H = 0 

and therefore⎯H,  like⎯E, can be related to a scalar magnetic potential [Amperes] Ψ: 

⎯H = -∇Ψ 

(4.4.21) 

(4.4.22) 

Since ∇ •⎯H = 0 when μ is independent of position, it follows that ∇•(-∇Ψ) = ∇2Ψ and: 

2∇ Ψ  = 0  

(Laplace’s equation for magnetic potential) 

(4.4.23) 


The  perfect  parallel  between  Laplace’s  equations  (4.4.20)  and  (4.4.23)  for  electric  and

magnetic  fields  in  charge-free  regions  offers  a  parallel  between  current  density⎯J  =  σ E   [A/m2] 

and magnetic flux density⎯B = μ H , and also between conductivity σ and permeability μ as they  

relate to gradients of electric and magnetic potential, respectively: 

∇2Φ = 0 

⎯E = -∇Φ 

∇2Ψ = 0 

⎯H = -∇Ψ 

⎯J = σ E  = - σ∇Φ 

⎯B = μ H  = - μ∇Ψ 

(4.4.24) 

(4.4.25) 

(4.4.26) 

Just as current is confined to flow within wires imbedded in insulating media having σ ≅ 0, so is 
magnetic  flux⎯B  trapped within  high-permeability materials  imbedded  in  very  low  permeability 

- 113 -


media,  as  suggested  by  the  discussion  in  Section  3.2.2  of  how  magnetic  fields  are  confined 
within high-permeability toroids. 

The  boundary  condition  (2.6.5)  that⎯B⊥  is  continuous  requires  that⎯B⊥ ≅  0  at  boundaries 
with  media  having  μ ≅  0;  thus  essentially  all  magnetic  flux⎯B  is  confined  within  permeable 
magnetic media having μ >> 0.

Two  parallel  examples  that  help  clarify  the  issues  are  illustrated  in  Figure  4.4.1.    In  Figure 
4.4.1(a)  a  battery  connected  to  perfect  conductors  apply  the  same  voltage  Φo  across  two 
conductors  in  parallel;  Ai,  σi,  di,  and  Ii  are  respectively  their  cross-sectional  area,  conductivity, 
length, and current flow for i = 1,2.  The current through each conductor is given by (4.4.26) and: 

Ii = JiAi = σι∇ΦiA = σιΦoAi/di = Φo/Ri 

where: 

Ri = di/σiAi  [ohms] 

is the resistance of conductor i, and I = V/R is Ohm’s law. 

(4.4.27) 

(4.4.28) 

For  the magnetic  circuit  of  Figure  4.4.1(b)  a  parallel  set  of  relations  is  obtained, where  the 
 
total magnetic  flux Λ = BA  [Webers]  through a cross-section of area A  is analogous  to current  I 
= JA.  The magnetic flux Λ through each magnetic branch is given by (4.4.26) so that: 

Λ i = BiAi = μι∇ΨiAi = μιΨoAi/di = Ψo/Ri 

where: 

Ri = di/μiA 

(4.4.29) 

(4.4.30) 

is the magnetic reluctance of branch i, analogous to the resistance of a conductive branch. 

Because  of  the  parallel  between  current  I  and  magnetic  flux  Λ,  they  divide  similarly 
between alternative parallel paths.  That is, the total current is: 

Io = I1 + I2 = Φ0(R1 + R2)/R1R2 

(4.4.31) 

- 114 -


The value of Φo found from (4.4.31) leads directly to the current-divider equation: 

I1 = Φo/R1 = IoR2/(R1 + R2) 

(4.4.32) 

So,  if R2  = ∞,  all  Io  flows  through R1; R2  =  0  implies  no  current  flows  through R1;  and R2  = R1 
implies half flows through each branch.  The corresponding equations for total magnetic flux and 
flux division in magnetic circuits are: 

Λo = Λ1 + Λ2 = Ψ0(R1 + R2)/R1R2 

Λ1 = Ψo/R1 = ΛoR2/(R1 + R2) 

(4.4.33) 

(4.4.34) 

Although  the  conductivity  of  insulators  surrounding  wires  is  generally  over  ten  orders  of 
magnitude  smaller  than  that  of  the  wires,  the  same  is  not  true  for  the  permeability  surrounding 
high-μ materials,  so  there  generally  is  some  small  amount  of  flux  leakage  from  such media;  the 
trapping  is  not  perfect.    In  this  case⎯H  outside  the  high-μ material  is  nearly  perpendicular  to  its 
surface, as shown in (2.6.13). 

Example 4.4B 
The magnetic circuit of Figure 4.4.1(b) is driven by a wire that carries 3 amperes and is wrapped 
50 times around the leftmost vertical member in a clockwise direction as seen from the top.  That 
member  has  infinite  permeability  (μ  = ∞),  as  do  the  top  and  bottom members.    If  the  rightmost 
member is missing, what is the magnetic field⎯H in the vertical member R1, for which the length 
is d and μ >> μo?   If both R1 and R2 are  in place and  identical, what  then are⎯H1 and⎯H2?  If R2 
is  removed  and  R1  consists  of  two  long  thin  bars  in  series  having  lengths  da  and  db,  cross-
sectional areas Aa and Ab, and permeabilities μa and μb, respectively, what then are⎯Ha and⎯Hb? 
Solution:  For  this  static  problem Ampere’s  law  (4.1.2)  becomes  (cid:118)∫C
H • d s  =  (cid:119)∫∫
 
J  • n da = N  I
ˆ 
A
= 50×3 =150  [A] = Hd.  Therefore⎯H =  zˆ 150/d  [A m-1], where  zˆ  and⎯H are upward 
due  to  the  right-hand  rule  associated  with  Ampere’s  law.    If  R2  is  added,  both  the 
integrals of⎯H through the two branches must still equal NI, so⎯H remains  zˆ 150/d [A 
m-1]  in both branches.  For  the  series case  the  integral of⎯H yields Hada + Hbdb = NI. 
Because the magnetic flux is trapped within this branch, it is constant: μaHaAa = BaAa 
=  BbAb  =  μbHbAb.  Therefore  Hb  =  Ha(μaAa/μbAb)  and  Ha[da  +  db(μaAa/μbAb)]  =  NI, 
so⎯Ha =  zˆ NI/[da + db(μaAa/μbAb)] [A m-1].

Laplace’s equation and separation of variables  

4.5.1  Laplace’s equation 

Electric  and  magnetic  fields  obey  Faraday’s  and  Ampere’s  laws,  respectively,  and  when  the 
fields are static and the charge and current are zero we have: 

- 115 -

∇ × E 0=  

∇ × H = 0

(4.5.1)

(4.5.2)

These equations are satisfied by any  E  or  H  that can be expressed as the gradient of a potential: 

E = −∇Φ  

H = −∇Ψ  

(4.5.3) 

(4.5.4) 

Therefore  Maxwell’s  equations  for  static  charge-free  regions  of  space  are  satisfied  for  any 
arbitrary differentiable potential  function  Φ ( r )  or  Ψ ( r ) , which  can be determined  as discussed 
below. 

Any  potential  function  must  be  consistent  with  the  given  boundary  conditions,  and  with 
Gauss’s laws in static charge- and current-free spaces: 

∇ • D = 0

∇ • B = 0

(4.5.5)

(4.5.6)

where  D = εE   and  B = μH .  Substituting  (4.5.3)  into  (4.5.5),  and  (4.5.4)  into  (4.5.6)  yields 
Laplace’s equation: 

∇ Φ2 = ∇  2Ψ = 0	  

(Laplace’s equation) 

(4.5.7) 

To  find  static  electric  or  magnetic  fields  produced  by  any  given  set  of  boundary  conditions  we 
need  only  to  solve  Laplace’s  equation  (4.5.7)  for  Φ  or  Ψ,  and  then  use  (4.5.3)  or  (4.5.4)  to 
compute  the gradient of  the potential.   One approach  to  solving Laplace’s equation  is developed 
in the following section. 

Example 4.5A 
Does the potential Φ = 1/r satisfy Laplace’s equation ∇2Φ = 0, where r = (x2 + y2 + z2)0.5? 

Solution:	 ∇2 = ∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 + ∂2/∂z2.  First: (∂/∂x) (x2 + y2 + z2)-0.5 = -0.5(x2 + y2 + z2)-1.5(2x), 
so  (∂2/∂x2)  (x2 + y2 + z2)-0.5 = 0.75(x2 + y2 + z2)-2.5(2x)2  -  (x2 + y2 + z2)-1.5 .  Therefore 
(∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 + ∂2/∂z2)(x2 + y2 + z2)-0.5 = 3(x2 + y2 + z2)-2.5(x2 + y2 + z2) - 3(x2 + y2 
+  z2)-1.5  =  0.  So  this  potential  satisfies  Laplace’s  equation.    The  algebra  could  have 
been  simplified  if  instead  we  wrote  ∇2  in  spherical  coordinates  (see  Appendix  C), 
because only the radial term is potentially non-zero for Φ = 1/r: ∇2 = r -2(∂/∂r)(r2∂/∂r). 
In  this case  the right-most factor  is r2∂r  -1/∂r =  r2(-r  -2) =  -1, and ∂(-1)/∂r = 0, so again 
∇2Φ = 0.

4.5.2 

Separation of variables 

We can find simple analytic solutions to Laplace’s equation only in a few special cases for which 
the  solutions  can  be  factored  into  products,  each  of  which  is  dependent  only  upon  a  single 
dimension  in  some  coordinate  system  compatible  with  the  geometry  of  the  given  boundaries. 
This process of separating Laplace’s equation and solutions into uni-dimensional factors is called 
separation  of  variables.  It  is most  easily  illustrated  in  terms  of  two  dimensions.    Let’s  assume 
the solution can be factored: 

Φ(x,y) = X(x)Y(y) 

Then Laplace’s equation becomes: 

(4.5.8) 

∇  2Φ = ∂  2 Φ ∂  2
2
x  + ∂  Φ ∂  y  = Y( y) d  X  dx  + X(x ) d  Y  dy 2  = 0 
2
2 
2
2 

(4.5.9) 

Dividing by X(x)Y(y) yields: 

⎡d  2 X (x )   dx  
2
2 ⎤⎦  X (x )  = − ⎡⎣d   Y ( y)   dy  2 ⎤⎦ 
⎣ 

Y ( y)  

(4.5.10)

Since  (4.5.10) must be  true  for all values of x, y,  it  follows  that each  term must equal a constant 
k2, called the separation constant, so that: 

d X2  dx  2

2 
= −k X  

2 
2
2
d Y dy  = k  Y  

Generic solutions to (4.5.11) are, for k ≠ 0: 

X(x) = A cos kx + B sin kx 

Y(y) = C cosh ky + D sinh ky 

An equivalent alternative is Y(y) = C' eky + D' e-ky.  Generic solutions when k = 0 are: 

X(x) = Ax + B 

Y(y) = Cy + D 

(4.5.11) 

(4.5.12) 

(4.5.13) 

(4.5.14) 

(4.5.15) 

Note that by letting k → jk, the sinusoidal x-dependence becomes hyperbolic, and the hyperbolic 
y  dependence  becomes  sinusoidal--the  roles  of  x  and  y  are  reversed.    Whether  k  is  zero,  real, 
imaginary,  or  complex  depends  upon  boundary  conditions.   Linear  combinations  of  solutions  to 
differential equations are also solutions to those same equations, and such combinations are often 
required to match boundary conditions. 

- 117 -


These  univariable  solutions  can  be  combined  to  yield  the  three  solution  forms  for  x-y 
coordinates: 

Φ(x,y) = (A + Bx)(C + Dy) 

Φ(x,y) = (A cos kx + B sin kx)(C cosh ky + D sinh ky) 

for k = 0 

(4.5.16) 

for k2 > 0 

(4.5.17) 

Φ(x,y) = (A cosh qx + B sinh qx)(C cos qy + D sin qy) 

for k2 < 0 (k = jq) 

(4.5.18) 

This  approach  can  be  extended  to  three  cartesian  dimensions  by  letting  Φ(x,y,z)  = 
X(x)Y(y)Z(z); this leads to the solution11: 

Φ(x,y,z) =  (A cos kxx + B sin kxx)(C cos kyy + D sin kyy)(E cosh kzz + F sinh kzz)  (4.5.19)

Consider an  infinitely  long slot of width w and depth d cut  into a perfectly conducting slab, 
and  suppose  the  cover  to  the  slot  has  the  voltage  distribution  V(x)  =  5  sin(πx/w)  volts,  as 
illustrated  in  Figure  4.5.1(a).    This  is  a  two-dimensional  cartesian-coordinate  problem,  so  the 
solution (4.5.17) is appropriate, where we must ensure this expression yields potentials that have 
the  given  voltage  across  the  top  of  the  slot  and  zero  potential  over  the  side  and  bottom 
boundaries of the slot.  Thus: 

Φ ( x , y ) = A sin ( πx w ) sinh ( πy w )

Figure 4.5.1(b) illustrates the solution for the case where the potential across the open top of 
the slot is given as V(x) = sin 2πx/w.  If an arbitrary voltage V(x) is applied across the opening at 
the top of the slot, then a sum of sine waves can be used to match the boundary conditions. 

Although  all  of  these  examples  were  in  terms  of  static  electric  fields  E   and  potentials  Φ, 
they  equally  well  could  have  been  posed  in  terms  of  static  H   and  magnetic  potential  Ψ;  the 
forms of solutions for Ψ are identical.

coordinates  via  (4.5.14)  and  (4.5.15),  so  the  potential  can  have  the  form 
Φ  =  (Ax  + B)(Cy  + D) where B  = D  =  0  for  this  example.   Boundary  conditions  are 
matched for Φ(x,y) = (V/L2)xy [V].  It follows that:   E = −∇Φ =  ( V L
2 ) ( xˆy + yˆx ) .

Separation of variables in cylindrical and spherical coordinates 

Laplace’s  equation  can  be  separated  only  in  four  known  coordinate  systems:  cartesian, 
cylindrical,  spherical,  and  elliptical.    Section  4.5.2  explored  separation  in  cartesian  coordinates, 
together with an example of how boundary conditions could  then be applied  to determine a  total 
solution  for  the  potential  and  therefore  for  the  fields.   The  same  procedure  can  be  used  in  a  few 
other coordinate systems, as illustrated below for cylindrical and spherical coordinates. 

12  sinh  x  = ( e x  − e − x ) 2  and  cosh  x  = ( e x  + e − x ) 2 .

When  there  is  no  dependence  on  the  z  coordinate,  Laplace’s  equation  in  cylindrical 
coordinates reduces to circular coordinates and is:

(4.5.21) 

Appendix  C  reviews  the  del  operator  in  several  coordinate  systems.    We  again  assume  the 
solution can be separated: 

Φ = R ( r )  Φ (  φ  )  

Substitution of (4.5.22) into (4.5.21) and dividing by R(r)Φ(φ) yields:

where m2 is the separation constant. 

(4.5.22)
 

(4.5.23) 

The solution to (4.5.23) depends on whether m2 is zero, positive, or negative: 

Φ(r,φ) = [A + Bφ][C + D (ln r)] 

Φ(r,φ) =(A sin mφ + B cos mφ)(Crm + Dr-m) 

(for m2 = 0) 

(4.5.24) 

(for m2 > 0) 

(4.5.25) 

Φ(r,φ) = [A sinh pφ + B cosh pφ][C cos(p ln r) + D sin(p ln r)] 

(for m2 < 0) 

(4.5.26) 

where A, B, C, and  D are constants to be determined and m ≡ jp for m2 < 0. 

A  few  examples  of  boundary  conditions  and  the  resulting  solutions  follow.    The  simplest 
case  is  a  uniform  field  in  the  + xˆ   direction;  the  solution  that matches  these  boundary  conditions 
is (4.5.25) for m = 1: 

Φ(r,φ) = Br cos φ 

(4.5.27)
 

Another  simple example  is  that of a conducting cylinder of  radius R and potential V.   Then 
the  potential  inside  the  cylinder  is V  and  that  outside  decays  as  ln  r,  as  given  by  (1.3.12), when 
m = C = 0: 

Φ ( r , φ ) = ( V  ln  R   ln  r  
) 

The electric field associated with this electric potential is: 

E = −∇Φ = −  r∂Φ ∂  r = rˆ ( V
ˆ 

ln R

) r −1 

 

 

(4.5.28)

(4.5.29)

Thus  E  is radially directed away from the conducting cylinder if V is positive, and decays as r-1.

A  final  interesting  example  is  that  of  a  dielectric  cylinder  perpendicular  to  an  applied 
electric field  E = xˆ Eo .  Outside the cylinder the potential follows from (4.5.25) for m = 1 and is: 

Φ ( r , φ ) =

 E  r cos φ +

( AR  r

The potential inside can have no singularity at the origin and is: 

Φ ( r , φ ) =

(4.5.30)

(4.5.31)
 

which corresponds  to a uniform electric field.   The unknown constants A and B can be found by 
matching  the  boundary  conditions  at  the  surface  of  the  dielectric  cylinder, where  both Φ  and⎯D 
must  be  continuous  across  the  boundary  between  regions  1  and  2.  The  two  linear  equations  for 
continuity  (Φ1  = Φ2,  and⎯D1  =⎯D2)  can  be  solved  for  the  two  unknowns A  and B.    The  electric 
fields for this case are sketched in Figure 4.5.2.

If  these cylindrical boundary conditions also vary with z,  the solution  to Laplace’s equation 
becomes: 

Φ(r,φ,z) = Φo[C1ekz + C2e-kz][C3 cos nφ + C4 sin nφ][C5Jn(kr) + C6Nn(kr)] 

(4.5.32) 

where Jn and Nn are Bessel functions of order n of  the first and second kind, respectively, and Ci 
are  dimensionless  constants  that  match  the  boundary  conditions.    The  rapidly  growing 
complexity of  these solutions as  the dimensionality of  the problem  increases generally mandates 
numerical solutions of such boundary value problems in practical cases. 

Our final example involves spherical coordinates, for which the solutions are: 

Φ(r,θ,φ) = Φo[C1rn + C2r-n-1][C3 cos mφ + C4 sin mφ][C5Pn

where  P m
n   and Q m
n   are  associated Legendre  functions  of  the  first  and  second  kind,  respectively, 
and  Ci  are  again  dimensionless  constants  chosen  to  match  boundary  conditions.    Certain 
spherical problems do not invoke Legendre functions, however, as illustrated below. 

A dielectric sphere inserted in a uniform electric field  xˆ Eo exhibits the same general form of 
solution as does the dielectric rod perpendicular to a uniform applied electric field; the solution is 
the sum of the applied field and the dipole field produced by the induced polarization charges on 
the  surface  of  the  rod  or  sphere.    Inside  the  sphere  the  field  is  uniform,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
4.5.2.  Polarization charges are discussed more fully in Section 2.5.3.  The potential follows from 
(4.5.33) with n = 1 and m = 0, and is simply: 
 Eo cos  θ ( C r  − 
1  C2R r −  )

where  C2  =  0  inside,  and  for  the  region  outside  the  cylinder  C2  is  proportional  to  the  induced 
electric dipole.  C1 outside is unity and inside diminishes below unity as ε increases. 

If  the  sphere  in  the  uniform  electric  field  is  conducting,  then  in  (4.5.34) C1  = C2  =  0  inside 
the sphere, and the field there is zero; the surface charge is:

(4.5.35)

Outside the conducting sphere C1 = 1, and to ensure Φ(r = R) = 0, C2 must also be unity. 

The  same  considerations  also  apply  to  magnetic  potentials.    For  example,  a  sphere  of 
permeability  μ  and  radius  R  placed  in  a  uniform  magnetic  field  would  also  have  an  induced 
magnetic  dipole  that  produces  a  uniform  magnetic  field  inside,  and  produces  outside  the 
superposition  of  the  original  uniform  field with  a magnetic  dipole  field  produced  by  the  sphere. 
A closely related example involves a sphere of radius R having surface current: 

Js  =φˆ sin θ   A⎡⎣ m −1 ⎤⎦ 

(4.5.36) 

This can be produced approximately by a coil wound on the surface of the sphere with a constant 
number of turns per unit length along the z axis. 

For  a  permeable  sphere  in  a  uniform  magnetic  field  H = − zˆHo ,  the  solution  to  Laplace’s 
equation for magnetic potential ∇2Ψ = 0 has a form similar to (4.5.34): 

Ψ ( r ,  θ ) = Cr cos  θ 

(inside the sphere; r < R) 

(4.5.37) 

Ψ ( r ,  θ ) = Cr  −2 cos  θ +

 H  o r  cos  θ 

(outside the sphere; r > R) 

(4.5.38)

Using  H = −∇Ψ , we obtain:

(4.5.40) 

Matching boundary conditions at the surface of the sphere yields C; e.g. equate  B = μH  inside to 
B = μoH  outside by equating (4.5.39) to (4.5.40) for θ = 0.

Flux tubes and field mapping 

4.6.1 

Static field flux tubes 

Flux  tubes  are  arbitrarily  designated  bundles  of  static  electric  or magnetic  field  lines  in  charge-
free regions, as illustrated in Figure 4.6.1.

The  divergence  of  such  static  fields  is  zero  by  virtue  of  Gauss’s  laws,  and  their  curl  is  zero  by 
virtue  of  Faraday’s  and  Ampere’s  laws.    The  integral  forms  of  Gauss’s  laws,  (2.4.17)  and 
(2.4.18), say that the total electric displacement  D  or magnetic flux  B  crossing the surface A of 
a volume V must be zero in a charge-free region:

Therefore  if  the walls  of  flux  tubes  are  parallel  to  the  fields  then  the walls  contribute  nothing  to 
the integrals (4.6.1) and (4.6.2) and the total flux entering the area A1 of the flux tube at one end 
(A1) must equal that exiting through the area A2 at the other end, as illustrated:

(4.6.4)

Consider  two  surfaces  with  potential  differences  between  them,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
4.6.1.  A  representative  flux  tube  is  shown  and  all  other  fields  are  omitted  from  the  figure.   The 
field  lines could correspond  to either  D  or  B .  Constant  ε and μ are not  required  for  D  and  B 
flux  tubes  because  D   and  B   already  incorporate  the  effects  of  inhomogeneous  media.    If  the 
permittivity  ε  and  permeability  μ  were  constant  then  the  figure  could  also  apply  to  E   or   H , 
respectively. 

4.6.2 

Field mapping 

E   and  H   are  gradients  of  the  potentials  Φ  and  Ψ,  respectively  [see  (4.6.2)  and  (4.6.5)],  and 
therefore  the  equipotential  surfaces  are  perpendicular  to  their  corresponding  fields,  as  suggested 
in Figure 4.6.1.  This orthogonality leads to a useful technique called field mapping for sketching 
approximately  correct  field  distributions  given  arbitrarily  shaped  surfaces  at  known  potentials. 
The method  is particularly simple  for “two-dimensional” geometries  that depend only on  the x,y 
coordinates  and  are  independent  of  z,  such  as  the  pair  of  circular  surfaces  illustrated  in  Figure 
4.6.2(a) and the pair of ovals in Figure 4.6.2(b).  Assume that the potential of the inner surface is 
Φ1 or Ψ1, and that at the outer surface is Φ2 or Ψ2.

equipotentials 

Because:  1)  the  lateral  spacing  between  adjacent  equipotential  surfaces  and  (in  two-
dimensional geometries) between adjacent  field  lines are both  inversely proportional  to  the  local 
field strength, and 2) the equipotentials and field lines are mutually orthogonal, it follows that the 
rectangular  shape  of  the  cells  formed  by  these  adjacent  lines  is  preserved  over  the  field  even  as 
the field strengths and cell sizes vary.  That is, the curvilinear square illustrated in Figure 4.6.2(a) 
has approximately  the same shape  (but not size) as all other cells  in  the figure, and approaches a 
perfect  square  as  the  cells  are  subdivided  indefinitely.    If  sketched  perfectly,  any  two­

- 124 -


dimensional  static  potential  distribution  can  be  subdivided  indefinitely  into  such  curvilinear 
square cells. 

One  algorithm  for  performing  such  a  subdivision  is  to  begin  by  sketching  a  first-guess 
equipotential  surface  that:  1)  separates  the  two  (or  more)  equipotential  boundaries  and  2)  is 
orthogonal  to  the  first-guess  field  lines,  which  also  can  be  sketched.    These  field  lines  must  be 
othogonal  to  the  equipotential  boundaries.  For  example,  this  first  sketched  surface  might  have 
potential  (Φ1  +  Φ2)/2,  where  Φ1  and  Φ2  are  the  applied  potentials.    The  spacing  between  the 
initially  sketched  field  lines  and  between  the  initial  equipotential  surfaces  should  form 
approximate  curvilinear  squares.    Each  such  square  can  then  be  subdivided  into  four  smaller 
curvilinear  squares  using  the  same  algorithm.    If  the  initial  guesses  were  correct,  then  the 
curvilinear  squares  approach  true  squares  when  infinitely  subdivided.    If  they  do  not,  the  first 
guess  is  revised  appropriately  and  the  process  can  be  repeated  until  the  desired  insight  or 
perfection is achieved.  In general there will be some fractional squares arranged along one of the 
field lines, but these become negligible in the limit. 

Figure  4.6.2(a)  illustrates  how  the  flux  tubes  in  a  co-axial  geometry  are  radial  with  field 
strength  inversely  proportional  to  radius.  Therefore,  when  designing  systems  limited  by  the 
maximum  allowable  field  strength,  one  avoids  incorporating  surfaces  with  small  radii  of 
curvature  or  sharp  points.  Figure  4.6.2(b)  illustrates  how  the  method  can  be  adapted  to 
arbitrarily  shaped  boundaries,  albeit  with  more  difficulty.    Computer-based  algorithms  using 
relaxation  techniques can  implement such strategies  rapidly  for both  two-dimensional and  three-
dimensional  geometries.    In  three  dimensions,  however,  the  spacing  between  field  lines  varies 
inversely with the square root of their strength, and so the height-to-width ratio of the curvilinear 
3-dimensional  rectangles  formed  by  the  field  lines  and  potentials  is  not  preserved  across  the 
structure.
