Chapter 11:  Common Antennas and Applications 

11.1  Aperture antennas and diffraction 

11.1.1  Introduction 

Antennas  couple  circuits  to  radiation,  and  vice  versa,  at  wavelengths  that  can  extend  into  the 
infrared  region  and  beyond.  The  output  of  an  antenna  is  a  voltage  or  field  proportional  to  the 
input  field  strength⎯E(t)  and  at  the  same  frequency.    By  this  definition,  devices  that  merely 
amplify,  detect,  or  mix  signals  are  not  antennas  because  they  do  not  preserve  phase  and 
frequency, although they generally are connected to the outputs of antennas.  For example, some 
sensors merely sense the increased temperature and heating caused by incoming waves.  Chapter 
10  introduced  short-dipole  and  small-loop  antennas,  and  arrays  thereof.    Chapter  11  continues 
with an  introductory discussion of aperture antennas and diffraction  in Section 11.1, and of wire 
antennas  in  11.2.  Applications  are  then  discussed  in  Section  11.4  after  surveying  the  basics  of 
wave  propagation  and  thermal  emission  in  Section  11.3.    These  applications  include 
communications,  radar  and  lidar,  radio  astronomy,  and  remote  sensing.  Most  optical 
applications are deferred to Chapter 12. 

11.1.2  Diffraction by apertures 

Plane  waves  passing  through  finite  openings  emerge  propagating  in  all  directions  by  a  process 
called  diffraction.  Antennas  that  radiate  or  receive  plane  waves  within  finite  apertures  are 
aperture antennas.  Examples  include  the parabolic  reflector antennas used  for  radio astronomy, 
radar,  and  receiving  satellite  television  signals,  as  well  as  the  lenses  and  finite  apertures 
employed  in  cameras, microscopes,  telescopes,  and  many  optical  communications  systems.    As 
in  the  case  of  dipole  antennas;  we  assume  reciprocity  and  knowledge  of  the  source  fields  or 
equivalent currents. 

Since  we  have  already  derived  expressions  for  fields  radiated  by  arbitrary  current 
distributions,  one  approach  to  finding  aperture-radiated  fields  is  to  determine  current 
distributions  equivalent  to  the  given  aperture  fields.    Then  these  equivalent  currents  can  be 
replaced by a continuous array of Hertzian dipoles for which we know the radiated far fields. 

Consider a uniform current sheet  J  [A m-1] occupying  the x-z plane, as  illustrated  in Figure 
11.1.1.  Maxwell’s equations are then satisfied by: 

ˆE − jky 
E = z

(11.1.4)

Therefore  we  can  consider  any  plane  wave  emerging  from  an  aperture  as  emanating  from  an 
equivalent current sheet⎯Js given by (11.1.4) provided we neglect radiation from the charges and 
currents  induced  at  the  aperture  edges.    They  can  generally  be  neglected  if  the  aperture  is  large 
compared  to  a  wavelength  and  if  we  remain  close  to  the  y  axis  in  the  direction  of  propagation, 
because  then  the  aperture  area  dominates  the  observable  radiating  area.    This  approximation 
(11.1.4)  for  a  finite  aperture  is  valid  even  if  the  strength  of  the  plane  wave  varies  across  the 
aperture slowly relative to a wavelength. 

The  equivalent  current  sheet  (11.1.4)  radiates  according  to  (11.1.5)  [from  (10.2.8)],  where 
we represent the current sheet by an equivalent array of Hertzian dipoles of length dz and current

To simplify the integral we can assume all rays are parallel by using the Fraunhofer far-field 
approximation: 

e− jkr ( x , z ) ≅ e − jkr o e+ jkrˆi r ' 

(Fraunhofer approximation) 

(11.1.7) 

where  we  define  position  within  the  aperture  r ' ≡ xxˆ + zzˆ ,  and  the  distance  ro  =  (x2  +  y2+  z2)0.5.

Those  points  in  space  too  close  to  the  aperture  for  the  Fraunhofer  approximation  to  apply  lie  in 
the  Fresnel  region  where  r  <  ~  2L2/λ, as  shown  in  (11.1.4).  If  we  restrict  ourselves  to  angles 
close  to  the  y  axis we  can  define  the  angles αx  and αz  from  the  y  axis  in  the  x  and  z  directions, 
respectively, as illustrated in Figure 11.1.1, so that:

which  is  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  aperture  field  distribution  Eoz (x ,z ) ,  times  a  factor  that 
depends  on  distance  r  and  wavelength  λ.  Unlike  the  usual  Fourier  transform  for  converting 
signals  between  the  time  and  frequency  domains,  this  reversible  transform  in  (11.1.10)  is 
between the aperture spatial domain and the far-field angular domain. 

For reference, the Fourier transform for signals is:

(11.1.12)

The  Fourier  transform  (11.1.11)  has  exactly  the  same  form  as  the  integral  of  (11.1.10)  if  we 
replace  the  aperture  coordinates  x  and  z  with  their  wavelength-normalized  equivalents  x/λ and 
z/λ, analogous to time t; α is analogous to frequency f. 

Assume  the  aperture  of  Figure  11.1.1  is  z-polarized,  has  dimensions  Lx  × Lz,  and  is 
uniformly illuminated with amplitude Eo.  Then its far fields can be computed using (11.1.10): 

55 In the Huygen’s approximation a factor of (1 + cosα)/2 is added to improve the accuracy, but this has little impact 
near the y axis.  In this expression α is the angle from the direction of propagation (y axis) in any direction.

The  function  (sin  x)/x  appears  so  often  in  electrical  engineering  that  it  has  its  own  symbol 
‘sinc(x)’.  Note that sinc(0) = 1 since sin(x) ≅ x – (x3/6) for x << 1.  This gain pattern is plotted in 
Figure  11.1.2.  The  first  nulls  occur  when  παιLi/λ  =  π  (i  =  x  or  z),  and  therefore  αnull  =  λ/L, 
where a narrower beamwidth α corresponds to a wider aperture L.  The on-axis gain is:

(gain of uniformly illuminated aperture area A)  (11.1.18) 

Equation  (11.1.18)  applies  to  any  uniformly  illuminated  aperture  antenna,  and  such  antennas 
have on-axis effective areas A(θ,φ)  that approach  their physical areas A, and have peak gains Go 
=  4πA/λ2.  The  antenna  pattern  of  Figure  11.1.2  vaguely  resembles  that  of  circular  apertures  as 
well,  and  the  same  nominal  angle  to  first  null,  λ/L,  roughly  applies  to  all.    Such  diffraction 
pattterns  largely explain  the  limiting angular  resolution of  telescopes, cameras, animal eyes, and 
photolithographic equipment used for fabricating integrated circuits.

Example 11.1A 
What  is  the  angle  between  the  first  nulls  of  the  diffraction  pattern  for  a  visible  laser  (λ  =  0.5 
microns)  illuminating  a  1-mm  square  aperture  (about  the  size  of  a  human  iris)?    What  is  the 
approximate  diffraction-limited  angular  resolution  of  the  human  visual  system?   How  does  this 
compare  to  the  maximum  angular  diameters  of  Venus,  Jupiter,  and  the  moon  (~1,  ~1,  and  ~30 
arc minutes in diameter, respectively)? 

Solution: 	 The first null occurs at φ = sin-1(λ/L) ≅ 5×10-7/10-3 = 5×10-4 radians = 0.029° ≅ 1.7 arc 
minutes.  This is 70 percent larger than the planets Venus and Jupiter at their points of 
closest  approach  to  Earth,  and  ~6  percent  of  the  lunar  diameter.    Cleverly  designed 
neuronal  connections  in  the  human  visual  system  improve  on  this  for  linear  features, 
as can a dark-adapted iris, which has a larger diameter. 

Example 11.1B 
A  cell-phone  dipole  antenna  radiates  one  watt  toward  a  uniformly  illuminated  square  aperture 
antenna  of  area  A  =  one  square  meter.    If  Pr  =  10-9  watts  are  required  by  the  receiver  for 
satisfactory  link  performance,  how  far  apart  r  can  these  two  terminals  be?   Does  this  depend  on 
the shape of the aperture antenna if A remains constant?

axis  gain  Gt  of  a  uniformly  illuminated  constant-phase  aperture  antenna  is  given  by 
(11.1.18).  The  denominator  depends  only  on  the  power  transmitted  through  the 
aperture A, not on its shape.  The numerator depends only on the on-axis far field Eff, 
given by (11.1.10), which again is independent of shape because the phase term in the 
integral  is  unity  over  the  entire  aperture.    Since  the  on-axis  gain  is  independent  of

(11.1.20)

The  unit  vector  rˆ points  from  the  antenna  toward  the  receiver  and  r'   is  a  vector  that  locates 
Eo (r ')   within  the  aperture.    This  expression  assumes  the  receiver  is  sufficiently  far  from  the 
 
aperture  that  a  single  unit  vector  rˆ   suffices  for  the  entire  aperture  and  that  the  receiver  is 
therefore  in  the  Fraunhofer  region.  The  alternative  is  the  near-field  Fresnel  region  where 
2<  D 2 /λ ,  as  discussed  in  Section  11.1.4;  D  is  the  aperture  diameter.    It  also  assumes  the 
r
observer  is  close  to  the  axis  perpendicular  to  the  aperture,  say  within  ~40°.  The  Huygen’s 
approximation  extends  this  angle  further  by  replacing  sinθ  with  (1  +  cosβ)/2,  where  θ  is 
measured from the polarization axis and β is measured from the y axis:

Evaluating  the  on-axis  gain  of  a  uniformly  excited  aperture  of  physical  area  A  having 
Eoz(x,z)  =  Eoz  is  straightforward  when  using  (11.1.21)  because  the  exponential  factor  in  the 
integral is unity within the entire aperture.  The gain follows from (11.1.16).  The results are:

(gain of uniform aperture)  (11.1.25)

Perhaps  the  most  familiar  radio  aperture  antennas  are  parabolic  dishes  having  a  point  feed 
that  radiates  energy  toward  a  parabolic  mirror  so  as  to  produce  a  planar  wave  front  for 
transmission, as suggested in Figure 11.1.3(a).  Conversely, incoming radiation is focused by the 
mirror  on  the  antenna  feed,  which  intercepts  and  couples  it  to  a  transmission  line  connected  to 
the  receiver.   Typical  focal  lengths  (labeled  “f”  in  the  figure)  are  ~half  the  diameter D  for  radio 
systems, and are often much longer for optical mirrors that produce images.

Figure 11.1.3  Aperture antennas and angle of first null. 
 

Figure  11.1.3(b)  suggests  the  angle  θn  at  which  the  first  null  of  a  uniformly  illuminated 
rectangular  aperture  of  width  D  occurs;  it  is  the  angle  at  which  all  the  phasors  emanating  from 
each point on the aperture integrate in (11.1.10) to zero.  In this case it is easy to pair the phasors 
originating D/2 apart so each pair cancels at θn.   For example,  radiation from aperture element 2 
has  to  travel  λ/2  farther  than  radiation  from  element  1  and  therefore  they  cancel  each  other. 
Similarly radiation from elements 3 and 4 cancel, and the sum of all such pairs cancel at the null 
angle:

(11.1.26)

where θn ≅ λ/D for λ/D << 1. 

Approximately  the  same  null  angle  results  for  uniformly  illuminated  circular  apertures,  for 
which  integration yields θn  ≅ 1.2λ/D.   Consider  the human  eye, which has  a pupil  that normally 
is ~2 mm in diameter, but can dilate to ~1 cm in the dark.  For a wavelength of 5×10-7 meters, we 
find  the  normal  diffraction-limited  angular  resolution  of  the  eye  is  ~λ/D  =  5×10-7/(2×10-3)  = 
2.5×10-4 radians or ~0.014 degrees, or ~0.9 arc minutes.   For comparison,  the planets Venus and 
Jupiter are approximately 1 arc minute in diameter at closest approach, and the moon and sun are 
approximately 30 arc minutes in diameter. 

A  large  astronomical  telescope  like  the  200-inch  system  at  Palomar  has  a  nominal 
diffraction limit of λ/D ≅ 5×10-7/5.08 ≅ 10-7 radians or ~0.02 arc seconds, where there are 60 arc 
seconds  in  an  arc  minute,  and  60  arc  minutes  in  a  degree.    This  is  adequate  to  resolve  an 
automobile  on  the moon.   Unfortunately mirror  surface  imperfections,  focus misplacement,  and 
atmospheric  turbulence  limit  the  actual  angular  resolution  of  Palomar  to  ~1  arc  second  on  the 
very best nights; normal daytime turbulence is far worse. 

Practical  issues  generally  shape  the  design  of  parabolic  radio  antennas.    First,  mechanical 
(gravity  and  wind)  and  thermal  issues  (temperature  gradients)  usually  limit  their  angular 
resolution  to  ~1  arc minute; most  antennas  are  too  small  relative  to λ  to  achieve  this  resolution, 
however.  Second,  the antenna  feed  that  illuminates  the parabola  tends  to spray  its  radiation  in a 
broad  pattern  that  extends  past  the  edge  of  the  reflector  creating  backlobes.  Third,  the  finite 
extent  of  the  aperture  results  in  an  antenna  pattern with  sidelobes  and  unwanted  responsiveness 
to directions beyond the main lobe. 

Equation  (11.1.10)  showed how  the angular dependence of  the  far-fields of an aperture was 
proportional  to  the Fourier  transform of  the aperture excitation function.   For example, (11.1.17) 
and Figure 11.1.2 showed the radiation pattern of a uniformly  illuminated aperture measuring Lx 
by Lz.  Significant energy was radiated beyond the first nulls at αx = λ/Lx and αz = λ/Lz.  A finite 
aperture necessarily radiates something at all angles,  just as a finite voltage pulse  in a circuit has 
at  least  some  energy  at  all  frequencies;  the  sharper  the  pulse  edges,  the  more  high-frequency 
content  they  have.  Therefore,  reducing  the  sharp  discontinuities  in  field  strength  at  the  aperture 
edge,  a  strategy  called  tapering,  can  reduce  diffraction  sidelobes.    Antenna  feeds  are  typically 
designed  to  reduce  field  strengths  by  factors  of  2-4  at  the  mirror  edges  for  this  reason,  but  the 
resulting  effective  reduction  in  aperture  diameter  produces  a  slightly  broader  main  lobe,  just  as 
the Fourier transform of a narrower pulse produces a broader spectral band.   

A  final  consideration  is  sometimes  important  when  designing  aperture  antennas,  and  that 
involves aperture blockage, which results when transmitted radiation reflected from the mirror is 
blocked or scattered by the antenna feed at the focus of the parabola.  Not only does the scattered 
radiation  contribute  to  side  or  back  lobes,  but  it  also  is  lost  to  the  main  beam.    Example  11.1C 
illustrates these issues.

antenna  gain  G(αx,  αz)  for  α  <<  1?   What  is  the  gain  Go'  if  the  center  of  this  fully  illuminated 
aperture  is  blocked  by  a  square  absorber  100  wavelengths  on  a  side?    What  is  the  extent  and 
approximate magnitude of the sidelobes introduced by the blockage? 

Solution:  The on-axis gain Go = A4π/λ2 = 10002  × 4π.  The angular dependence is proportional 
2
to the square of the far-field,  E ( α αx ,
z ) , where the far field is the Fourier transform
of  the  aperture  field  distribution.    The  full  solution  for  G(αx,  αz)  is  developed  in 
Equations  (11.1.13–17).  If  the  blocked  portion  of  the  aperture  is  illuminated  so  the 
energy  there  is  absorbed,  then  the  total  transmitted  power  Pt  in  the  expression 
(11.1.16)  for  gain  is  unchanged,  while  the  area  over  which  Eff' 
is  integrated  in 
(11.1.13) is reduced by the 1 percent blockage (1002 is 1 percent of 10002).  Therefore 
2
E ff ' ( 0, 0
 ) 
,  the  numerator  of  (11.1.16),  and  Go'(0,0)  are  all  reduced  by  a  factor  of 
0.992  ≅  0.98.  Thus  Go'  ≅  0.98  Go.  If  the  blocked  portion  of  the  aperture  were  not 
illuminated so as  to avoid  the one percent absorption,  then Go'(0,0) would be reduced 
by only 1 percent: Go' = A'4π/λ2.  The sidelobes for  the blocked aperture follow from 
the  Fourier  transform  (11.1.13), where  the  aperture  excitation Eo(x,z)  is  the  sum  of  a 
positive square “boxcar” function 1000λ on a side, and a negative square boxcar 100λ 
on a side.  Since  this  transform  is  linear,  E ff  ( α x , α z )   is  the sum of  the  transforms of 
 
the  positive  and  negative  boxcar  functions,  and  the  antenna  sidelobes  therefore  have 
contributions from each.  Most important is the main lobe of the diffraction pattern of 
the  smaller  “blockage”  boxcar,  which  has  magnitude  ~0.012  that  of  Go',  and  a  half-
power beamwidth θBB that is 10 times greater than the main lobe of the larger boxcar: 
θBB  ≅ λ/DB  =  λ/100λ.    The  total  antenna  pattern  is  the  square  of  the  summed 
transforms  and  more  complicated;  the  innermost  few  sidelobes  are  approximately 
those  of  the  original  antenna,  while  the  blockage-induced  sidelobes  are  more 
important at greater angles. 

11.1.4  Near-field diffraction and Fresnel zones 

Often receivers are sufficiently close to the source that the Fraunhofer parallel-ray approximation 
of (11.1.7) is invalid.  	Then the  Huygen’s approximation (11.1.21) can be used:

(Huygen’s approximation)  (11.1.27)

for which  the distance between  the  receiver and  the point x,y  in  the aperture  is defined as  r(x,y). 
This region close  to a source or obstacle where the Fraunhofer approximation  is  invalid  is called 
the Fresnel region. 

- 347 -


If  the  phase  of  Eoz  in  the  source  aperture  is  constant  everywhere,  then  contributions  to 
Eff(0,0)  from  some  parts  of  the  aperture  will  tend  to  cancel  contributions  from  other  parts 
because  they  are  out  of  phase.  For  example,  contributions  from  the  central  circular  zone where 
r(x,y)  ranges  from  ro  to  ro  +  λ/2  will  largely  cancel  the  contributions  from  the  surrounding  ring 
where  r(x,y)  ranges  from  ro  +  λ/2  to  ro  +  λ;  it  is  easily  shown  that  these  two  rings  have 
approximately  the  same  area,  as  do  all  such  rings  over  which  the  delay  varies  by  λ/2.56    Such  
rings are illustrated in Figure 11.1.4(a).

One  technique  for  maximizing  diffraction  toward  an  observer  is  therefore  simply  to 
physically block radiation from those alternate zones contributing negative fields, as suggested in 
Figure 11.1.4(a).  Such a blocking device is called a Fresnel zone plate.  The central ring having 
positive phase  is called  the Fresnel zone.  Note  that  if only  the central zone  is permitted  to pass, 
the received intensity is maximum, and if the first two zones pass, the received intensity is nearly 
zero  because  they  have  approximately  the  same  area.    The  second  zone  is  weaker,  however, 
because r and θ are larger.  Three zones can yield nearly the same intensity as the first zone alone 
because  two  of  the  three  zones  nearly  cancel,  and  so  on.   By  blocking  alternate  zones  the 
received intensity can be many times greater than if there were no blockage at all.  Thus a multi-
ring zone plate acts as a lense by focusing energy received over a much larger area than would be 
intercepted  by  the  receiver  alone.  This  type  of  lense  is  particularly  valuable  for  focusing  very 
short-wave  radiation  such  as  x-rays  which  are  difficult  to  reflect  or  diffract  using  traditional 
mirrors or lenses. 

Another  advantage  of  zone  plate  lenses  is  that  they  can  be  manufactured  lithographically, 
and  their  critical  dimensions  are  usually many  times  larger  than  the wavelengths  involved.    For 
example, an x-ray zone plate designed to operate at λ = 10-8 [m] at a distance ro of one centimeter 

56 The area of  the  inner circle  (radius a)  is πa2 = π[(ro + λ/2)2  -  ro
2] ≅ πroλ  if λ << 2ro.   The area of  the  immediately 
surrounding  Fresnel  ring  (radius  b)  is  π(b2  -  a2)  =  π[(ro  +  λ)2  -  ro
2]  - π[(ro  +  λ/2)2  -  ro
2]  ≅ πroλ,  subject  to  the  same 
approximation.  Similarly, all other Fresnel rings can be shown to have approximately the same area if λ << 2ro.

Another  example  of  diffraction  is  wireless  communications  in  urban  environments,  which 
often  involves  line-of-sight  reception  of  waves  past  linear  obstacles  slightly  to  one  side  or 
slightly  obscuring  the  source.  Again Huygen’s  equation  (11.1.27)  can  be  used  to  determine  the 
result.  Referring to Figure 11.1.4(b), if there is no blockage, traditional equations can be used to 
compute  the  received  intensity.    If  exactly  half  the  path  is  blocked  by  a  wall  obscuring  the 
bottom  half  of  the  illuminated  aperture,  for  example,  then  the  integral  in  (11.1.27)  will  yield 
exactly  half  the  previous  value  of  Eff,  and  the  power  (proportional  to  E 2
ff )  will  be  reduced  by  a 
factor  of  four,  or  ~6dB.  If  the  observer  moves  up  or  down  less  than  ~half  the  radius  of  the 
Fresnel  zone,  then  the  received  power will  vary  only modestly.    For  example,  an  FM  radio  (say 
108  Hz)  about  100  meters  beyond  a  tall  wide  metal  wall  can  have  a  line  of  sight  that  passes 
through  the  wall  a  distance  of  ~(rλ)0.5/2  =  17  meters  below  its  top  without  suffering  great  loss; 
(rλ)0.5  is  the  radius  of  the  Fresnel  zone.    Conversely,  a  line-of-sight  that  passes  less  than  ~17 
meters above the top of the wall will also experience modest diffractive effects. 

The  Fresnel  region  approximately  begins  when  the  central  ray  arrives  at  distance  ro,  more 
than λ/16 ahead of rays from the perimeter of an aperture of diameter D.  That is:

11.2  Wire antennas 

11.2.1  Introduction to wire antennas 

(11.1.29)

(Fresnel region)  (11.1.30)

Exact  solution  of Maxwell’s  equations  for  antennas  is  difficult  because  antennas  typically  have 
complex  shapes  for  which  it  is  difficult  to  match  boundary  conditions.    Often  complex  wave 
expansions with many  degrees  of  freedom  are  required,  and  even modern  software  tools  can  be 
challenged.  Fortunately,  most  common  wire  antennas  permit  their  current  distributions  to  be 
guessed  accurately  relative  to  the  given  terminal  current,  as  explained  in  Section  11.2.2.    Once 
the  current  distribution  is  known  everywhere,  the  radiated  fields,  radiation  and  dissipative 

- 349 -


resistance, antenna gain, and antenna effective area can be calculated.  If the antenna is used at a 
frequency far from resonance, the reactance can also be estimated. 

If  the  antenna  is  small  compared  to  a  wavelength  λ  then  its  current  distribution  I  and  the 
open-circuit  voltage  VTh  can  be  determined  using  the  quasistatic  approximation.    If  the  current 
distribution  is  known,  then  the  radiated  far-fields  E ff   can  be  computed  using  (10.2.8)  by 
integrating  the  contributions  ΔE ff   from  each  short  current  element  Id  (d  is  the  element  length 
and is replaced by ds in the integral), where: 
ΔE ff  = θ ˆ jk Idηo e− jkr sin

(11.2.2)

For antennas small compared to λ the factor before the integral of (11.2.2) is nearly constant over 
the integrated length S, so average values suffice.  If the wires run in more than one direction, the 
definition of  θˆ  and θ must change accordingly; θ is defined by the local angle between  I  and  rˆ , 
where  rˆ   is  the  unit  vector  pointing  from  the  antenna  to  the  observer,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
10.2.3.  Equation  (11.2.2), not  surprisingly,  reduces  to  (11.2.1)  for  a  short  straight wire  carrying 
constant current I over a distance d << λ. 

Once the radiated fields are known for a given antenna input current I, the radiated intensity 
can be  integrated over a  sphere  surrounding  the antenna  to yield  the  total power  radiated PR and 
the  radiation  resistance  Rr,  which  usually  dominates  the  resistive  component  of  the  antenna 
impedance and corresponds to power lost through radiation (10.3.16).  The radiation resistance is 
simply related to PR: 

R r  =

2P
R  [ohms
]  
I 2

 

(radiation resistance) 

(11.2.3) 

The open-circuit voltage can also be easily estimated for wire antennas small compared to λ. 
For  example,  the  open-circuit  voltage  induced  across  a  short  dipole  antenna  shown  in  Figure 
10.3.1 is simply the projection of the incident electric field  E  on the electrical centers of the two 
metallic  structures  comprising  the  dipole,  and  Example  10.3D  showed  how  the  open-circuit 
voltage  across  a  loop  antenna  was  proportional  to  the  time  derivative  of  the  magnetic  flux 
through  it. 
In  both  cases  the  open-circuit  voltage  reveals  the  directional  properties  of  the 
antenna.  Computation  of  the  radiation  resistance  requires  knowledge  of  the  radiated  fields  and 
integration  of  the  radiated  power  over  all  angles,  however.    Equation  (10.3.16)  showed  that  the 
radiation  resistance  of  a  short  dipole  antenna  of  length  d  is  (2πηo/3)(d/λ)2  ohms.    Slightly more 
complicated  integrals over angles yield  the  radiation  resistance  for half-wave dipoles of  length d 
and  N-turn  loop  antennas  of  diameter  d  <<  λ:  ~73  ohms  and  ~1.9×104N2(d/λ)4  ohms, 
respectively.  The  higher  radiation  resistance  of  loop  antennas  often makes  them  the  antenna  of

choice  when  space  is  limited  relative  to  wavelength,  particularly  when  they  are  wound  on  a 
ferrite core (μ >> μo) that increases their magnetic dipole moment. 

Most  wire  antennas  are  not  small  compared  to  a  wavelength,  however,  and  the methods  of 
the next section are then often used. 

11.2.2  Current distribution on wires 

The  current  distribution  on  wires  is  governed  by  Maxwell’s  equations,  which  are  most  easily 
solved for simple geometries such as  that of a coaxial cable, as discussed  in Example 7.1B.   The 
fields for a TEM wave in a coaxial cable are cylindrically symmetric and a function of radius r:

(11.2.5)

The energy density and Poynting’s vector are proportional  to  field strength squared, so  they 
decay  as  r-2.    Therefore  the  electromagnetic  behavior  of  the  line  is  dominated  by  the  geometry 
near  the  central  conductor  where  most  of  the  electromagnetic  energy  is  located,  and  the  outer 
conductor  can  be  deformed  substantially  before  the  fields  near  the  center  are  significantly 
perturbed.  For  example,  two-thirds  of  the  power  propagates  within  10  cm  of  a  1-mm  wire 
centered  within  a  1-meter  outer  cylinder,  even  though  this  represents  only  one-percent  of  the 
volume.    This  is  easily  shown  by  integrating  the  energy  density  from  radius  a  to  radius  b,

Therefore  the  fields  near  the  axis  of  the  coaxial  cable  illustrated  in  Figure  11.2.1(a)  are 
altered  but  little  if  the  outer  conductor  is  replaced  by  a  ground  plane  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
11.2.1(b),  or  even  by  a  second  wire,  as  shown  in  Figure  11.2.1(c).    The  significance  of  Figure 
11.2.1  is  therefore  that  current  distributions  on  thin  wire  antennas  closely  resemble  those  on 
equivalent  TEM  lines,  provided  the  lines  are  not  so  many  wavelengths  long  that  the  energy  is 
lost before it reaches the end, or so tightly bent that the segments induce strong voltages on their 
neighbors.  This TEM approximation is valid for understanding the examples of this section. 

A  widely  used  antenna  is  the  half-wave  dipole,  illustrated  in  Figure  11.2.1(d),  which 
exhibits  essentially  no  reactive  impedance  because  the  electric  and  magnetic  energy  storages 
approximately  balance.    The  radiation  resistance  for  any  half-wave  dipole  in  free  space  is  ~73 
ohms.    Section  7.4.2  discusses  how  these  energies  balance  in  any  TEM  structure  of  length  D  = 
nλ/2 where n is an integer.  Typical bandwidths Δω of a half-wave dipole are Δω/ωo = 1/Q ≅ 0.1, 
where Q = ωowT/Pd, as discussed in Section 7.4.3 and (7.4.4). 

57 The magnetic field around a central wire, H = I/2πr, was given in (1.4.3).

In  these  idealized cases  the currents everywhere on  the antenna approach zero one-quarter cycle 
later  as  the  energy  all  converts  from  magnetic  to  electric.    The  voltage  distributions  when  the 
currents  are  zero  resemble  those on  the  equivalent TEM  lines,  and  are offset  spatially by λ/4;  at 

- 352 -


resonance  the  voltage  peaks  coincide  with  the  current  nulls.    For  example,  the  voltages  and 
currents  for  Figure  11.2.2(a)  resemble  those  of  the  open-circuited  TEM  resonator  of  Figure 
7.4.1(a).  The  actual  current  and  voltage  distributions  are  slightly  different  from  those  pictured 
because  radiation  tends  to  weaken  the  currents  farther  from  the  antenna  terminals,  and  because 
such free-standing or bent wires are not true TEM lines. 

Figure  11.2.2(b)  illustrates  how  terminal  currents  (Io)  can  be  made  less  than  one-third  the 
peak  currents  (3.2  Io)  flowing  on  the  antenna  simply  by  lengthening  the  two  arms  so  they  are 
each  slightly  longer  than  λ/2  so  the  current  is  close  to  a  null  at  the  terminals.    Because  smaller 
terminal  currents  thus  correspond  to  larger  antenna  currents  and  radiated  power,  the  effective 
radiation resistance of this antenna is increased well above the nominal 73 ohms of the half-wave 
dipole  of  (a).  The  reactance  is  slightly  capacitive,  however,  and  should  be  canceled  with  an 
inductor.  Figure  11.2.2(c)  illustrates  how  the  peak  currents  can  be  made  different  in  the  two 
arms; note  that  the  currents  fed  to  the  two  arms must be  equal  and opposite,  and  this  fact  forces 
the  two  peak  currents  in  the  arms  to  differ.
  Figures  (d)  and  (e)  show  more  elaborate 
configurations,  demonstrating  that  wire  antennas  do  not  have  to  lie  in  a  straight  line.    The 
patterns for these antennas are discussed in the next section. 

11.2.3  Antenna patterns 

Once the current distributions on wire antennas are known, the antenna patterns can be computed 
using  (11.2.2).  Consider  first  the  dipole  antenna  of  Figure  11.2.2(a)  and  let  its  length  be  d,  its 
terminal current be Io ′, and its maximum current be Io.  Then (11.2.2) becomes:

This  expression,  which  requires  some  effort  to  derive,  applies  to  symmetric  dipole  antennas  of 
any  modest  length  d;  Io  is  the  maximum  current,  which  is  not  necessarily  the  terminal  current. 
The common half-wave dipole has d = λ/2, so (11.2.7) reduces to:

The  antenna  of  Figure  11.2.2(b)  can  be  considered  to  be  a  two-element  antenna  array  (see 
Section  10.4.1)  for which  the  two  radiated  phasors  add  in  some  directions  and  cancel  in  others, 
depending on  the differential phase  lag between  the  two  rays. Antenna  (b) has  its peak gain at θ 
=  π/2,  but  its  beamwidth  is  less  than  for  (a)  because  rays  from  the  two  arms  of  the  dipole  are 
increasingly  out  of  phase  for  propagation  directions  closer  to  the  z  axis,  even more  than  for  the 
half-wave  dipole;  thus  the  gain  of  (b)  modestly  exceeds  that  of  (a).    Whether  one  determines 
patterns  numerically  or  by  using  the more  intuitive  phasor  addition  approach  of  Sections  10.4.1

and  10.4.5  is  a  matter  of  choice.    Antenna  (c)  has  very  modest  nulls  for  θ  close  to  the  ±z  axis. 
The  nulls  are  weak  because  the  electric  field  due  to  3.2Io  is  only  slightly  reduced  by  the 
contributions from the phase-reversed segment carrying Io. 

Simple  inspection  of  the  current  distribution  for  the  antenna  of  Figure  11.2.2(d)  and  use  of 
the methods of Section 10.4.1  reveal  that  its pattern has peaks  in gain along  the ±x and ±y axes, 
and  a null  along  the ±z  axes.  Extending  simple  superposition  and phase  cancellation  arguments 
to  other  angular  directions  makes  it  possible  to  guess  the  form  of  the  complete  antenna  pattern 
G(θ,φ),  and  therefore  to  check  the  accuracy  of  any  integration  using  (11.2.6)  for  all  antenna 
arms.    Similar  simple  phase  addition/cancellation  analysis  reveals  that  the  more  complicated 
antenna  (e)  has  gain  peaks  along  the  ±x  and  ±y  axes,  and  nulls  along  the  ±z  axes,  although  the 
polarization  of  each  peak  is  somewhat  different,  as  discussed  in  an  example.    Exact 
determination of pattern (e)  is confused by  the  fact  that  these wires are sufficiently close  to each 
other  to  interact,  so  the  current  distribution  may  be  modified  relative  to  the  nominal  TEM 
assumption sketched in the figure. 

Example 11.2A 
Determine  the  relative  gains  and  polarizations  along  the  ±x,  ±y,  and  ±z  axes  for  the  antenna 
illustrated in Figure 11.2.2(e). 

Solution:	 The two x-oriented wires do not radiate in the ±x direction.  The four z-oriented wires 
emit radiation that cancels in that direction (one pair cancels the other), while the two 
y-oriented  wires  radiate  in-phase  y-polarized  radiation  in  the  ±x  direction  with 
relative  total  electric  field  strength  Ey  =  2.  We  assume  each  λ/2  segment  radiates  a 
relative  electric  field  of  unity.    Similarly,  the  two  y-oriented  wires  do  not  radiate  in 
the  ±y  direction.  The  four  z-oriented  wires  emit  radiation  that  cancels  in  that 
direction  (one pair cancels  the other), while  the  two x-oriented wires  radiate  in-phase 
x-polarized radiation  in  the ±y direction with  relative  total electric  field strength Ex = 
2.  The  four  z-oriented  wires  do  not  radiate  in  the  ±z  direction,  and  the  two  out-of­
phase pairs of currents  in  the x and y directions also cancel  in  that direction, yielding 
a  perfect  null.    Thus  the  gains  are  equal  in  the  x  and  y  directions  (but  with  x 
polarization along the y axis, and y-polarization along the x axis), and the gain is zero 
on the z axis. 

11.3  Propagation of radio waves and thermal emission 

11.3.1  Multipath propagation 

Electromagnetic waves can be absorbed, refracted, and scattered as they propagate through linear 
media.    One  result  of  this  is  that  beams  from  the  same  transmitter  can  arrive  at  a  receiver  from 
multiple  directions  simultaneously  with  differing  delays,  strengths,  polarizations,  and  Doppler 
shifts.    These  separate  phasors  add  constructively  or  destructively  to  yield  an  enhanced  or 
diminished  total  response  that  is  generally  frequency  dependent.    Since  cellular  telephones  are 

- 354 -


mobile  and  seldom  have  a  completely  unobstructed  propagation  path,  they  often  exhibit  strong 
fading and multipath effects. 

Consider  first  the  simple  case where  a  single  beam  arrives  via  a  direct  path  and  a  reflected 
beam with one-quarter the power of the first arrives along a reflected path that is 100λ longer.  If 
the  powers  of  these  two  beams  are  constant,  then  the  total  received  power  will  fluctuate  with 
frequency.  If  the  voltage  received  for  the  direct  beam  is  V  and  that  of  the  second  beam  is  V/2 
corresponding  to  quarter  power,  then  when  they  are  in  phase  the  total  received  power  is 
1.52|V|2/2R,  where  R  is  the  circuit  impedance.    When  they  are  180o  out  of  phase  the  power  is 
0.52|V|2/2R, or one-ninth the maximum.  This shift between maximum and minimum occurs each 
time the relative delay between the two paths changes by λ/2.  Because the differential delay D is 
~100λ,  this  represents  a  frequency  change  Δf  of  only  one  part  in  200;  Δf/f  =  λ/2D.    Note  that 
reflections  can  enhance  or  diminish  the  main  signal,  and  clever  antenna  arrays  can  always 
compensate  for  the differential delays experienced  from different directions so as  to enhance  the 
result. 

Since  cellular  phones  can  have  path  differences  of  ~1  km  at  wavelengths  of  ~10  cm,  their 
two-beam  frequency  maxima  can  be  separated  by  as  little  as  10-4f,  where  f  can  be  ~109  Hz. 
Fortunately  this  separation  of  105  Hz  is  large  compared  to  typical  voice  bandwidths. 
Alternatively, cellular phone signals can be coded  to cover bandwidths  large compared  to fading 
bandwidths  so  the  received  signal  strength  is  averaged  over multiple  frequency  nulls  and  peaks 
and is therefore more stable. 

Multipath  also  produces  nulls  in  space  if  the  rays  arrive  from  different  directions.    For 
example, if two rays A and B of wavelength λ and arrive from angles separated by a small angle 
γ,  then  the distance D between  intensity maxima  and minima  along  a  line  roughly perpendicular 
to  the  direction  of  arrival will  be ~λ/(2sinγ).  The  geometry  is  sketched  in Figure  11.3.1.   Three 
or  more  beams  can  be  analyzed  by  similar  phasor  addition  methods.    Sometimes  one  of  the 
beams  is  reflected  from  a  moving  surface,  or  the  transmitter  or  receiver  are  moving,  so  these 
maxima and minima can vary rapidly with time.

Example 11.3A 
Normal  broadcast NTSC  television  signals  have  6-MHz  bandwidth.    If  a metal  building  reflects 
perfectly  a  signal  that  travels  a  distance  L  further  than  the  direct  beam  before  the  two  equal-
strength  beams  sum  at  the  receiving  antenna,  how  large  can  L  be  and  still  ensure  that  there  are 
not two nulls in the 6-MHz passband between 100 and 106 MHz? 

Solution:	 The  differential  path  L  is  L/λ  wavelengths  long. 
If  this  number  of  wavelengths 
increases by one,  then L/λ' = L/λ + 1 as λ decreases  to λ';  this  implies λ/λ' = 1 + λ/L 
=  f  '/f  =  1.06.   When  the  direct  and  reflected  signals  sum,  the  2π  phase  change  over 
this  frequency band will produce one null, or almost  two nulls  if  they  fall at  the band 
edges.  Note  that  only  the  differential  path  length  is  important  here.    Therefore  L  = 
λ/(1.06 - 1) ≅ 16.7λ = 16.7c/f ≅ 16.7×3×108/108 = 50.0 meters. 

11.3.2  Absorption, scattering, and diffraction 

The  terrestrial  atmosphere  can  absorb,  scatter,  and  refract  electromagnetic  radiation.    The 
dominant  gaseous  absorbers  at  radio  and  microwave  wavelengths  are  water  vapor  and  oxygen. 
At  submillimeter  and  infrared  wavelengths,  numerous  trace  gases  such  as  ozone,  NO,  CO,  OH, 
and others also become important.  At wavelengths longer than 3 mm only the oxygen absorption 
band ~50 - 70 GHz is reasonably opaque.  Horizontal attenuation at some frequencies 57-63 GHz 
exceeds  10  dB/km,  and  vertical  attenuation  can  exceed  100  dB.    The  water  vapor  band  20-24 
GHz  absorbs  less  than  25  percent  of  radiation  transmitted  toward  zenith  or  along  a  ~2-km 
horizontal path. 

More  important  at  low  frequencies  is  the  ionosphere,  which  reflects  all  radiation  below  its 
plasma frequency fo, as discussed in Section 9.5.3.  Radio waves transmitted vertically upward at 
frequency  f  are  reflected  directly  back  if  any  ionospheric  layer  has  a  plasma  frequency  fp  <  f, 
where  fp  is  given  by  (9.5.25)  and  is  usually  below  15 MHz.   The  ionosphere  generally  extends 
from  ~70  to  ~700  km  altitude,  with  electron  densities  peaking  ~300  km  and  exhibiting 
significant drops below ~200 km at night when  solar  radiation no  longer  ionizes  the atmosphere 
fast enough to overcome recombination. 

Above  the  plasma  frequency  fp  radio  waves  are  also  perfectly  reflected  at  an  angle  of 
reflection  θr  equal  to  the  angle  of  incidence  θi  if  θi  exceeds  the  critical  angle  θc(f)  (9.2.30)  for 
any  ionospheric  layer.  The  critical  angle  θc(f)  =  sin-1(εion/εo),  where  the  permittivity  of  the 
ionosphere  εion(f)  =  εo[1  -  (fp/f)2].  Since  εo  >  εion  at  any  finite  frequency,  there  exists  a  grazing 
angle of incidence θi where waves are perfectly reflected from the ionosphere at frequencies well 
above  fp.  The  curvature  of  the  earth  precludes  grazing  incidence  with  θi  →  90°  unless  the 
bottom  surface  of  the  ionosphere  is  substantially  tilted.    Therefore  the  maximum  frequency  at 
which  radio  waves  can  bounce  around  the  world  between  the  ionosphere  and  the  surface  of  the 
earth is limited to ~2fp, depending on the height of the ionosphere for the frequency of interest. 

The most important non-gaseous atmospheric absorbers are clouds and rain, where the latter 
can  attenuate  signals  30  dB  or  more.  Rain  is  a  major  absorber  for  centimeter-wavelength 
satellite  dishes,  partly  in  the  atmosphere  and  partly  as  the  rain  accumulates  on  the  antennas.   At 

- 356 -


longer  wavelengths  most  systems  have  enough  sensitivity  to  tolerate  such  attenuation.    In 
comparison,  clouds  are  usually  not  a  problem  except  for  through-the-air  optical  communication 
systems. 

Atmospheric  refraction  is  dominated  by  water  vapor  at  radio  wavelengths  and  by 
atmospheric  density  at  optical  wavelengths.    These  effects  are  not  trivial.    The  radio  sun  can 
appear  to  set  almost one  solar diameter  later on  a very humid  summer day  (the  sun  emits  strong 
radio  waves  too),  and  weak  scattering  from  inhomogeneities  in  atmospheric  humidity  was  once 
used  as  a  major  long-distance  radio  communications  technique  that  avoided  reliance  on  signals 
reflected  from  the  ionosphere,  as  well  as  providing  bandwidths  of  several  GHz.    Refraction  by 
the  ionosphere  is  even  more  extreme,  and  the  angles  of  refraction  can  be  computed  using  the 
properties of plasmas noted in Section 9.5.3 and Snell’s law (9.2.26). 

It  is  often  convenient  to  model  urban  multipath  and  diffractive  communications  links  by  a 
power  law  other  than  r-2.  One  common model  is  r-3.8, which  approximates  the  random weaking 
of signals by sequences of urban obstacles as signals 1.5-5 GHz propagate further.   In any study 
 
of  wireless  communications  systems  propagation  effects  such  as  these  must  always  be 
considered. 

11.3.3  Thermal emission 

A  final  effect  impacting  wireless  communications  systems  is  thermal  noise  arising  from  the 
environment,  plus  other  forms  of  interference.    Usually  the  thermal  noise  is  considered 
interference  too,  but  in  radio  astronomy  and  remote  sensing  it  is  the  signal  of  interest.   Thermal 
noise  arises  from  electromagnetic  radiation  emitted  by  electrons  colliding  randomly  with  other 
particles  in  thermal  equilibrium  at  temperature T.   These  collisions  cause  electrons  to  accelerate 
in  random  directions  and  therefore  radiate.    Thus  every  material  object  or  medium  radiates 
thermal  noise  provided  that  object  or  medium  is  coupled  to  the  radiation  field  to  any  degree  at 
all.  Decoupled media perfectly reflect or transmit electromagnetic radiation without loss and are 
rare. 

Thermal radiation propagating in a single-mode transmission line has intensity:

[ 
I W/Hz 
e 

≅ kT  for hf  (cid:19) kT 
− 1 

58

 

(thermal intensity) 

(11.3.1) 

Because  there  is  a  one-to-one  relationship  between  intensity  I  and  the  corresponding 
brightness  temperature  T,  the  brightness  temperature  T[K]  =  I/k  often  replaces  I  because  of  its 
more  natural  physical  significance.  T  is  the  temperature  of  a matched  load  (R  = Zo)  that would 
naturally  radiate  the  same  intensity  I  =  kT  Watts/Hz  for  hf  <<  kT.    This  Rayleigh-Jeans 
approximation for I is valid at temperatures T above 50K for all frequencies f below ~100 GHz. 

Thus the Thevenin equivalent circuit of a resistor at temperature T includes a voltage source 
producing  a  generally  observable  gaussian  white  voltage  vTh(t)  called  Johnson  noise.  This 
 

58 eδ = 1 + δ + δ2/2! +… for δ << 1. 

- 357 -


source  voltage  vTh(t)  radiates  kTB  [W]  down  a matched  transmission  line within  the  bandwidth 
 This Johnson noise voltage vTh(t) also divides across  the Thevenin  resistance R and  its 
B  [Hz].
matched load Zo = R to produce the propagating line voltage v+(t, z=0) = vTh/2.  But the radiated

(11.3.2)

Therefore within  bandwidth B  the  root-mean-square  open-circuit  thermal  voltage  vThrms  across  a 
resistor R at temperature T is: 

vThrms  = 4kTBRV [

]  

(Johnson noise) 

(11.3.3) 

A TEM  line of  impedance Zo does not add any  Johnson noise  to  that of  the  resistor  if  the  line  is 
lossless and therefore decoupled from the radiation. 

Any  antenna  matched  to  its  TEM  transmission  line  therefore  receives  thermal  noise  power 
kTAB [W] from the environment, where TA is defined as the antenna temperature. TA is the gain-
weighted average of the brightness temperature TB of the environment over 4π steradians:

If  the  entire  field  of  view  has  brightness  temperature  TB  =  To,  and  if  the  antenna  is  lossless  so 
that G(θ,φ) = D(θ,φ), then TA = To since  ∫ D ,(θ φ Ω)d 
4π (10.3.3).

11.3.4  Radio astronomy and remote sensing 

An  antenna  looking  down  at  the  earth  sees  a  brightness  temperature  TB,  which  is  the  sum  of 
thermal  radiation  emitted  by  the  earth  plus  downward  propagating  power  that  is  then  reflected 
B = ξT +  |Γ| TB', where  the emissivity of  the earth ξ = 1  -  |Γ|2, Γ  is  the 
2
from  the same surface:   T
wave  reflection  coefficient  of  the  earth,  and  TB'  is  the  brightness  temperature  of  the  radiation 
reflected  from  the  earth  into  the  antenna  beam.    The  radiation  from  space  at  microwave 
frequencies  has  a  brightness  temperature  near  2.7K  arising  from  the  "big  bang"  that  occurred  at 
the  birth  of  the  universe,  and  reaches  temperatures  over  7000K  in  the  direction  of  the  sun  and 
certain astronomical objects, depending on  frequency.   The  science of  radio astronomy  involves 
the study of such celestial radio waves. 

The  emissivity  1  -  |Γ|2  of  the  terrestrial  surface  is  typically  0.85-0.98  over  land  and  >(cid:4) 0.3 
over  ocean.  Since  most  communications  antennas  point  horizontally,  about  half  their  beam 
intercepts  the  earth  (~260K)  and  half  intercepts  space  (~4K  at  microwave  frequencies),  so  the 
thermal  noise  from  the  environment  typically  adds  ~132K  to  the  antenna  temperature  and  total 
system noise.

The  study  of  natural  radio,  infrared,  and  visible  emission  from  the  earth  is  called  remote 
sensing,  although  one  can  also  remotely  sense  biological,  manufacturing,  and  other  systems. 
Today  many  satellites  in  polar  and  geostationary  orbits  routinely  observe  the  earth  at  tens  to 
thousands  of  wavelengths  across  the  radio  and  optical  spectrum  for  meteorological  and  other 
geophysical  purposes.  For  example,  a  satellite  observing  in  the  opaque  53-67  GHz  oxygen 
resonance  band  can  not  see much  lower  than  70  km  altitude  at  the  very  centers  of  the  strongest 
spectral  lines,  and  therefore  those  channels  observe  the  temperature  of  the  atmosphere  at  those 
high altitudes.  At nearby frequencies where the atmosphere is more transparent these sensors see 
the air temperatures at lower altitudes.  Combinations of such observations yield the temperature 
profile  of  the  atmosphere  all  over  the  globe,  enabling  better  numerical  weather  predictions. 
Channels  near  the  centers  of water  vapor,  ozone,  and  other  spectral  lines  can  similarly measure 
their  abundance  and  altitude  profiles  for  similar  purposes.    Channels  in  the  more  transparent 
bands  see  closer  to  the  terrestrial  surface  and  permit  estimates  to  be  made  of  rain  rate,  surface 
winds, soil moisture, and other parameters. 

Communications,  radioastronomy,  and  remote  sensing  systems  all  receive  non-thermal 
radio  interference as well.   Man-made  interference comes from other  transmitters  in  the same or 
nearby  bands,  automobiles,  microwave  ovens,  motors,  power  supplies,  corona  around  power 
lines,  and  other  electrical  devices.    Each  unshielded  wire  in  any  electrical  device  is  a  small 
antenna  that  radiates.   For  example,  computers  can  emit highly  structured  signals  that  reveal  the 
state  of  the  computation  and,  in  special  cases,  even  the  contents  of  registers.    Poorly  shielded 
power  supplies  often  radiate  at  very  high  harmonics  of  their  fundamental  operating  frequencies. 
Fortunately,  regulations  increasingly  restrict  radio  emissions  from  modern  electrical  and 
electronic  systems.   Natural  non-thermal  emission  arises  from  lightning,  solar  bursts,  the  planet 
Jupiter, and other sources. 

11.4  Applications 

11.4.1  Wireless communications systems 

Section  11.4.1  introduces  simple  communications  systems  without  using  Maxwell’s  equations 
and  Section  11.4.2  then  discusses  radar  and  lidar  systems  used  for  surveillance  and  research. 
Optical  communications  is  deferred  to  Chapter  12,  while  the  design,  transformation,  and 
switching of the communications signals themselves are issues left to other texts. 

Wireless  communications  systems  have  a  long  history,  beginning  with  wireless  telegraph 
systems  installed  several  years  after  Hertz’s  laboratory  demonstrations  of  wireless  links  late  in 
the  nineteenth  century.    These  systems  typically  used  line-of-sight  propagation  paths,  and 
sometimes  inter-continental  ionospheric  reflections.    Telephone,  radio,  and  television  systems 
followed.  In  the  mid-twentieth  century,  the  longer  interstate  and  international  wireless  links 
were  almost  entirely  replaced  by  more  capable  and  reliable  coaxial  cables  and  multi-hop 
microwave  links.    These  were  soon  supplemented  by  satellite  links  typically  operating  at 
frequencies up to ~14 GHz; today frequencies up to ~100 GHz are used.  At century’s end, these 
longer  microwave  links  were  then  largely  replaced  again,  this  time  by  optical  fibers  with 
bandwidths  of  Terahertz.  At  the  same  time  many  of  the  shorter  links  are  being  replaced  or 
supplemented  by wireless  cellular  technology, which was made  practical by  the  development  of 

- 359 -


inexpensive  r.f.  integrated  circuits.  Each  technical  advance  markedly  boosted  capacity  and 
market penetration, and generally increased performance and user mobility while reducing costs. 

Most U.S.  homes  and  offices  are  currently  served  by  twisted  pairs  of  telephone wires,  each 
capable  of  conveying  ~50  kbs  -  1.5 Mbps,  although  coaxial  cables,  satellite  links,  and  wireless 
services  are  making  significant  inroads.    The  most  common  wireless  services  currently  include 
cell  phones,  wireless  phones  (within  a  home  or  office),  wireless  internet  connections,  wireless 
intra-home  and  intra-office  connections,  walkie-talkies  (dedicated  mobile  links),  satellite  links, 
microwave  tower  links, and many  specialized variations designed  for private or military use.    In 
addition,  optical  or  microwave  line-of-sight  links  between  buildings  offer  instant  broadband 
connectivity  for  the  “last mile”  to  some users;  the  last mile accounts  for a  significant  fraction of 
all installed plant cost.  Weather generally restricts optical links to very short hops or to weather-
independent  optical  fibers.  Specialized  wireless  medical  devices,  such  as  RF  links  to  video 
cameras inside swallowed pills, are also being developed. 

Broadcast services now  include AM  radio near 1 MHz, FM  radio near 100 MHz and higher 
frequencies, TV in several bands between 50 and 600 MHz for local over-the-air service, and TV 
and radio delivered by satellite at ~4, ~12, and ~20 GHz.   Shortwave radio below ~30 MHz also 
offers global international broadcasts dependent upon ionospheric conditions, and is widely used 
by radio hams for long-distance communications. 

Wireless services are so widespread today that we may take them for granted, forgetting that 
a  few  generations  ago  the  very  concept  of  communicating  by  invisible  silent  radio  waves  was 
considered magic.   Despite  the wide  range  of  services  already  in  use,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume 
that  over  the  next  few  decades  numerous  other  wireless  technologies  and  services  will  be 
developed by today’s engineering students. 

Communications  systems  convey  information  between  two  or  more  nodes,  usually  via 
wires, wireless means, or optical fibers.  After a brief discussion relating signaling rates (bits per 
second)  to  the  signal  power  required  at  the  wireless  receiver,  this  section  discusses  in  general 
terms  the  launching,  propagation,  and  reception  of  electromagnetic  signals  and  messages  in 
wired and wireless systems. 

Information  is  typically measured  in bits.   One bit of  information  is  the  information content 
of  a  single  yes-no  decision,  where  each  outcome  is  equally  likely.    A  string  of M  binary  digits 
(equiprobable  0’s  or  1’s)  conveys  M  bits  of  information.    An  analog  signal  measured  with  an 
accuracy  of  one  part  in  2M  also  conveys  M  bits  because  a  unique  M-bit  binary  number 
corresponds  to  each  discernable  analog  value.    Thus  both  analog  and  digital  signals  can  be 
characterized  in  terms of  the bits of  information  they convey.   All wireless  receivers require  that 
the  energy  received  per  bit  exceed  a  rough  minimum  of  wo  ≅  10-20  Joules/bit,  although  most 
practical systems are orders of magnitude less sensitive.59 

59 Most good communications systems can operate with acceptable probabilities of error  if Eb/No >~10, where Eb  is 
the  energy  per  bit  and  No  =  kT  is  the  noise  power  density  [W  Hz-1]  =  [J].    Boltzmann's  constant  k  ≅  1.38×10-23 
[J oK-1], and T is the system noise temperature, which might approximate 100K in a good system at RF frequencies. 
Thus the nominal minimum energy Eb  required to detect each bit of information is ~10No  ≅ 10-20 [J]. 

- 360 -


To  convey  N  bits  per  second  [b  s-1]  of  information  therefore  requires  that  at  least  ~Nwo 
watts [W] be intercepted by the receiver, and that substantially more power be transmitted.  Note 
that [W] = [J s-1] = [J b-1][b s-1].  Wireless communications is practical because so little power Pr 
is  actually  required  at  the  receiver.  For  example,  to  communicate  100  megabits  per  second 
(Mbps) requires as little as one picowatt (10-12W) at the receiver if w
-20
o = 10 ; that is, we require 
Pr > Nw ≅ 108×10-20
 = 10-12 [W]. 
o 

It  is  fortunate  that  radio  receivers  are  so  sensitive,  because  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  the 
transmitted  power  usually  reaches  them.    In  most  cases  the  path  loss  between  transmitter  and 
receiver  is primarily geometric;  the  radiation  travels  in  straight  lines  away  from  the  transmitting 
antenna with an  intensity  I  [W m-2]  that grows weaker with distance  r as  r-2.  For example,  if  the 
transmitter  is  isotropic  and  radiates  its  power  Pt  equally  in  all  4π  directions,  then  I(θ,φ,r)  = 
Pt/4πr2  [W  m-2].  The  power  Pr  intercepted  by  the  receiving  antenna  is  proportional  to  the 
incident wave  intensity  I(θ,φ)  and  the  receiving  antenna  effective  area A(θ,φ)  [m2],  or  “capture 
cross-section”, where the power Pr received from a plane wave incident from direction θ,φ is: 

P = θI (  φ, r
, 
r

A ( θ, φ )  [W ]  
) 
 
 

(antenna gain) 

(11.4.1) 

The power received from an isotropic transmitting antenna is therefore Pr = (Pt/4πr2)A(θ,φ), so in 
this  special  case  the  line-of-sight  path  loss  between  transmitter  and  receiver  is  Pr/Pt  = 
A(θ,φ)/4πr2,  or  that  fractional  area  of  a  sphere  of  radius  r  represented  by  the  receiving  antenna 
cross-section  A.    Sometimes  additional  propagation  losses  due  to  rain,  gaseous  absorption,  or 
scattering must be recognized too, as discussed in Section 11.3.2. 

In  general,  however,  the  transmitting  antenna  is  not  isotropic,  but  is  designed  to  radiate 
power  preferentially  in  the  direction  of  the  receivers.    We  define  antenna  gain  G(θ,φ),  often 
called “gain over  isotropic”, as  the  ratio of  the  intensity  I(θ,φ,r)  [W m-2] of waves  transmitted  in 
the  direction  θ,φ  (spherical  coordinates)  at  distance  r,  to  the  intensity  that  would  be  transmitted 
by an isotropic antenna.  That is:

(antenna gain) 

(11.4.2) 

If  the  radiated  power  is  conserved,  then  the  integral  of  wave  intensity  over  a  spherical  surface 
enclosing  the antenna  is  independent of  the  sphere’s  radius  r.   Therefore  the angular distribution 
of power and G(θ,φ) plotted  in  spherical coordinates behave much  like a balloon  that must push 
out  somewhere  when  it  is  pushed  inward  somewhere  else,  as  suggested  in  Figure  11.4.1.    The 
maximum  gain Go  often  defines  the  z  axis  and  is  called  the  on-axis  gain.   The  angular width θB 
of  the main beam at  the half-power points where G(θ,φ) ≅ Go/2  is called  the antenna beamwidth 
or  “half-power  beamwidth”.   Other  local  peaks  in  gain  are  called  sidelobes,  and  those  sidelobes 
behind the antenna are often called backlobes.  Angles at which the gain is nearly zero are called 
nulls.

Isotropic and directive antenna gain patterns. 

Antennas with G(θ,φ) >  1  generally  focus  their  radiated  energy  by  using  lenses, mirrors,  or 
multiple radiators phased so their radiated contributions add in phase in the desired direction, and 
largely  cancel  otherwise.  Typical  gains  for  most  wire  antennas  range  from  ~1.5  to  ~100,  and 
large  aperture  antennas  such  as  parabolic  dishes  or  optical  systems  can  have  gains  of  108  or 
more.  The directionality or gain of a mirror or any antenna system is generally the same whether 
it is transmitting or receiving.60  The fundamentals of transmission and reception are presented in 
more detail in Section 10.3.1. 

Consider  the  following  typical  example.  A  television  station  transmits  100  kW  at  ~100 
MHz  toward  the  horizon  with  an  antenna  gain  of  ~10.    Because  the  gain  is  much  greater  than 
unity  in  the  desired  horizontal  direction,  it  is  therefore  less  than  unity  for most  other  downward 
and upward directions where users are either nearby or absent.  The intensity I [W m-2] sensed by 
users on the horizon at 100-km range follows from (11.4.2):

(11.4.3)

Whether  this  intensity  is  sufficient  depends  on  the  properties  of  the  receiving  antenna  and 
receiver.  For  the example of Equation  (11.4.3), a  typical TV antenna with an effective area A ≅ 
2  [m2]  would  capture  IA  ≅  10-5[W/m2]  ×  2[m2]  =  2×10-5  [W].    If  the  received  power  is 
2 ( ) 
5 [W],  and  the  receiver  has  an  input  impedance  R  of  100  ohms,  then  the  root­

 R  ≅ ×10− 
mean-square (rms) voltage  v rms  ≡  v 2 ( )t  0.5 would be (0.002)0.5  ≅ 14 mv, much larger than typical 
noise levels in TV receivers (~10 μv).61 

60 The degree of focus is the same whether the waves are transmitted or received.  That is, if we reverse the direction 
of  time  for  a  valid  electromagnetic  wave  solution  to  Maxwell’s  equations,  the  result  is  also  a  valid  solution  if  the 
system is lossless and reciprocal.  Reciprocity requires that the complex matrices characterizing ε, μ, and σ near the 
antenna  equal  their  own  transposes;  this  excludes  magnetized  plasmas  such  as  the  ionosphere,  and  magnetized 
ferrites, as discussed further in Section 10.3.4. 
61  Typical  TV  receivers might  have  a  superimposed  noise  voltage  of  power N  =  kTB  [W], where  the  system  noise 
temperature  T  might  be  ~104  K  (much  is  interference),  Boltzmann's  constant  k  =  1.38×10-23,  and  B  is  bandwidth 
[Hz].   B ≅ 6 MHz for over-the-air  television.   Therefore N ≅ 1.38×10-23×104×6×106  ≅ 8×10-13  watts, and a good TV 
signal-to-noise ratio S/N of ~104 requires only ~ 8×10-9 watts of signal S.  Since N ≅ n 2
rms  /R, the rms noise voltage ≅ 
(NR)0.5, or ~10 μv if the receiver input impedance R = 100 ohms.

Because most antennas are equally  focused whether  they are  receiving or  transmitting,  their 
effective area A(θ,φ) and gain G(θ,φ) are closely related:

Therefore  the  on-axis  gain  Go  =  4πAo/λ2.  This  relation  (11.4.4)  was  proven  for  a  short  dipole 
antenna  in  Section  10.3.3  and  proven  for  other  types  of  antenna  in  Section  10.3.4,  although  the 
proof  is  not  necessary  here.   This  relation  is  often  useful  in  estimating  the  peak  gain  of  aperture 
antennas  like  parabolic  mirrors  or  lenses  because  their  peak  effective  area  Ao  often  approaches 
their physical cross-section Ap within a factor of two; typically Ao  ≅ 0.6 Ap.  This approximation 
does  not  apply  to wire  antennas,  however. Thus we  can  easily  estimate  the  on-axis  gain  of  such 
aperture antennas:

where  Gt  is  the  gain  of  the  transmitting  antenna  and  Ar  is  the  effective  area  of  the  receiving

A  second  example  illustrates  how  a  communications  system  might  work.    Consider  a 
geosynchronous  communications  satellite62  transmitting  12-GHz  high-definition  television 
(HDTV)  signals  at  20  Mbps  to  homes  with  1-meter  dishes,  and  assume  the  satellite  antenna 
spreads  its  power  Pt  roughly  equally  over  the  eastern  United  States,  say  3×106  km2.  Then  the 
intensity  of  the waves  falling  on  the U.S.  is:  I  ≅ Pt/(3×1012)  [W m-2],  and  the  power  Pr  received 
by an antenna with effective area Ao  ≅ 0.6 [m2] is:

The  equality  of  the  right-hand  parts  of  (11.4.7)  and  (11.4.8)  reveals  that  one watt  of  transmitter 
power Pt in this satellite could send a digital HDTV signal to all the homes and businesses in the 

62 A  satellite approximately 35,000 km above  the equator circles  the earth  in 24 hours at  the  same  rate at which  the 
earth  rotates,  and  therefore  can  remain  effectively  stationary  in  the  sky  as  a  communications  terminal  serving 
continental areas.  Such satellites are called “geostationary” or “geosynchronous”. 

- 363 -


eastern  U.S.  Since  a  20-dB  margin63  for  rain  attenuation,  noisy  receivers,  smaller  or  poorly 
pointed home antennas, etc. is desirable, 100-watt transmitters might be used in practice. 

We  can  also  estimate  the  physical  area  Ap  of  the  aperture  antenna  on  the  satellite.    If  we 
know Pt and I at the earth, then we can determine the satellite gain G using I = GPt/4πr2 (11.4.2), 
where  r  ≅  40,000  km  in  the  northern  U.S;  here  we  have  I  ≅  3.3×10-12  when  Pt  =  1  watt.    The 
wavelength λ at 12 GHz is 2.5 cm (λ = c/f). But Ap  ≅ 1.5Ao, where Ao is related to G by (11.4.4). 
Therefore we obtain the reasonable result that a 2.5-meter diameter parabolic dish on the satellite 
should suffice: 
A p  ≅ 1.5A o  = (1.5 λ  4π)G = (1.5λ  4π)(4πr   I P )  ≅ 5 ⎣⎡m  ⎦

(11.4.9)

The same result could have been obtained by determining the angular extent of the U.S. coverage 
area  as  seen  from  the  satellite  and  then,  as  discussed  in  Section  11.1.2,  determining  what 
diameter antenna would have a diffraction pattern with that same beamwidth. 

Thus we can design digital communications systems for a data rate R [b s-1] if we know the 
range  r, wavelength  λ,  and  receiver  sensitivity  (Joules  required  per  bit).   For  analog  systems we 
also need  to know  the desired signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR) at  the  receiver and  the noise power N. 
Table 11.4.1 lists typical data rates R for various applications, and Table 11.4.2 lists typical SNR 
values required for various types of analog signal.

Example 11.4A 
A parabolic reflector antenna of 2-meter diameter  transmits Pt = 10 watts at 3 GHz  from beyond 
the  edge  of  the  solar  system  (R  ≅  1010  km)  to  a  similar  antenna  on  earth  of  50-m  diameter  at  a

11.4.2  Radar and lidar 

Radar  (RAdio  Direction  and  Range  finding)  and  lidar  (LIght  Direction  and  Range  finding) 
systems transmit signals toward targets of interest and receive echoes.  They typically determine: 
1)  target  distance  using  the  round-trip  propagation  delay,  2)  target  direction  using  echo  strength 
relative  to  antenna  orientation,  3)  target  radial  velocity  using  the  observed Doppler  shift,  and  4) 
target  size  or  scattering  properties  using  the  maximum  echo  strength.    Figure  11.4.2  illustrates 
the most common radar configuration.

65 For digital signals the dimensionless signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) given here is the energy-per-bit Eb divided by the 
noise power density No [W Hz-1], where No  = kT and T is the noise temperature, say 100-104K typically.  For analog 
signals, S and N are the total signal and noise powers, respectively, where N = kTB and B is signal bandwidth [Hz].

To compute  the received power, we first compute  the  intensity It of radiation at the target at

(intensity at radar)  (11.4.11)

where  σs  is  the  scattering  cross-section  of  the  target  and  is  defined  by  (11.4.11).  That  is,  σs  is 
the  capture  cross-section  [m2]  at  the  target  that  would  produce  Ir  if  the  target  scattered  incident 
radiation  isotropically.    Thus  targets  that  preferentially  scatter  radiation  toward  the  transmitter 
can have scattering cross-sections substantially larger than their physical cross-sections. 

The  received  power  Pr  is  then  simply  IrAr  [W],  where  Ar  is  the  effective  area  of  the 
receiving antenna.  That is:

where  we  used  Ar  =  Gλ2/4π,  and  where  (11.4.13)  is  often  called  the  radar  equation.  The 
dependence of received power on the fourth power of range and the square of antenna gain often 
control radar system design. 

(radar equation)  (11.4.13)

Atmospheric  attenuation  is  often  included  in  the  radar  equation  by  means  of  a  round-trip 
attenuation  factor  e-2αr, where α  is  the  average  atmospheric  attenuation  coefficient  (m-1)  and  r  is 
range.  Atmospheric  attenuation  is  discussed  in  Section  11.3.2  and  below  200  GHz  is  due 
principally  to oxygen, water vapor, and  rain;  it  is usually not  important below ~3 GHz.   Oxygen 
absorption  occurs  primarily  in  the  lowest  10  km  of  the  atmosphere  ~50-70  GHz  and  near  118 
GHz, water  vapor  absorption  occurs  primarily  in  the  lowest  3  km  of  the  atmosphere  above  ~10 
GHz, and rain absorption occurs up to ~15 km in the largest rain cells above ~3 GHz. 

Lidar systems also obey the radar equation, but aerosol scattering by clouds, haze, or smoke 
becomes more of a concern.  Also the phase fronts of optical beams are more easily disturbed by 
refractive  inhomogeneities  in  the  atmosphere  that  can  modulate  received  echoes  on  time  scales 
of milliseconds with random fading of ten dB or more. 

A simple example  illustrates use of  the radar equation (11.4.13).   Suppose we wish  to know 
the  range  r  at  which  we  can  detect  dangerous  asteroids  having  diameters  over  ~300m  that  are 

- 366 -


approaching the earth.  Assume the receiver has additive noise characterized by the system noise 
temperature Ts,  and  that  the  radar  bandwidth  is  one Hertz  because  the  received  sinusoid will  be 
averaged for approximately one second.  Detectable radar echos must have Pr > kTsB [W], where 
k is Boltzmann's constant (k = 1.38×10-23) and B is the system bandwidth (~1 Hz); this implies Pr 
≅ 1.4×10-23 Ts watts.  We can estimate σs for a 300-meter asteroid by assuming it reflects roughly 
as well as the earth, say fifteen percent, and that the scattering is roughly isotropic; then σs  ≅ 104 
[m2].  If  we  further  assume  our  radar  is  using  near  state-of-the-art  components,  then  we  might 
have Pt  ≅ 1 Mw, Gt  ≅ 108, λ = 0.1 m, and Ts  ≅ 10K.  The radar equation then yields:

(11.4.14)

This  range  is  about  one-third  of  the  distance  to  the  sun  and  would  provide  about  2-3  weeks 
warning. 

Optical  systems  with  a  large  aperture  area  A  might  perform  this  task  better  because  their 
antenna gain G = A4π/λ2, and λ  for  lidar  is  typically 10-5  that of a common  radar.  For antennas 
of the same physical aperture and transmitter power, 1-micron lidar has an advantage over 10-cm 
radar of ~1010 in Pr/Pt. 

Radar  suffers  because  of  its  dependence  on  the  fourth  power  of  range  for  targets  smaller 
than the antenna beamwidth.   If the radar can place all of its transmitted energy on target, then it 
suffers  only  the  range-squared  loss  of  the  return  path.    The  ability  of  lidar  systems  to  strongly 
focus  their  transmitting  beam  totally  onto  a  small  target  often  enables  their  operation  in  the 
highly advantageous r-2 regime rather than r-4. 

Equations  (11.4.13)  and  (11.4.14)  can  easily  be  revised  for  the  case  where  all  the  radar 
energy intercepts the target.  The radar equation then becomes:

(11.4.15)

where  the  target  retro-reflectivity  R  is  defined  by  (11.4.15)  and  is  the  dimensionless  ratio  of 
back-scattered  radiation  intensity  at  the  radar  to  what  would  be  back  scattered  if  the  radiation 
were scattered isotropically by the target.  For the same assumptions used before, asteroids could 
be  detected  at  a  range  r  of  ~3×1012  km  if  R  ≅  0.2,  a  typical  value  for  icy  rock.    The  implied 
detection distance  is now dramatically  farther  than before, and  reaches outside our  solar  system. 
However,  the  requirement  that  the  entire  radar  beam  hit  the  asteroid  would  be  essentially 
impossible even for the very best optical systems, so this approach to boosting detection range is 
usually not practical for probing small distant objects. 

Radar systems often use phased arrays of antenna elements, as discussed  in Section 10.4,  to 
focus  their  energy  on  small  spots  or  to  look  in more  than  one  direction  at  once.    In  fact  a  single 
moving  radar  system,  on  an  airplane  for  example,  can  coherently  receive  sequential  reflected 
radar  pulses  and  digitally  reassemble  the  signal  over  some  time  period  so  as  to  synthesize  the 
equivalent of a phased array antenna that is far larger than the physical antenna.   That  is, a small 

- 367 -


receiving  antenna  can  be  moved  over  a  much  larger  area  A,  and  by  combining  its  received 
signals  from  different  locations  in  a  phase-coherent  way,  can  provide  the  superior  angular 
resolution  associated  with  area  A.    This  is  called  synthetic  aperture  radar  (SAR)  and  is  not 
discussed further here. 

Example 11.4B 
A  radar  with  1-GHz  bandwidth  and  40-dB  gain  at  10  GHz  views  the  sun,  which  has  angular 
diameter  0.5 degrees  and  brightness  temperature  TB  =  10,000K.  Roughly  what  is  the  antenna 
temperature  TA  and  the  power  received  by  the  radar  from  the  sun  if  we  ignore  any  radar 
reflections? 

Solution:	 The power  received  is  the  intensity at  the antenna port  I  [W/Hz]  times  the bandwidth 
B  [Hz],  where  I  ≅  kTA  (11.3.1),  and  TA  is  the  antenna  temperature  given  by  the 
integral  in  (11.3.4).   This  integral  is  trivial  if G(θ,φ)  is  nearly  constant  over  the  solid 
angle ΩS of  the sun;  then TA  ≅  GoTBΩS/4π.  Constant gain across the sun requires the 
antenna beamwidth θB >> 0.5 degrees.  We can roughly estimate θB by approximating 
the  antenna  gain  as  a  constant  Go  over  solid  angle  ΩB,  and  zero  elsewhere;  then 
∫4π  G(θ,φ)dΩ  =  4π  =  GoΩB  =  104ΩB. 
(10.3.3)  yields 
 
Therefore 
ΩB  ≅  4π/104  ≅ π(θB/2)2,  and  θB  ≅  0.04  radians  ≅  2.3  degrees,  which  is  marginally 
greater  than  the  solar  diameter  required  for  use  of  the  approximation  θB  >>  0.5  in  a 
rough  estimate.    It  follows  that  TA  ≅  GoTBΩS/4π  =  104×104× π(θS/2)2/4π ≅ 
480  degrees  Kelvin,  somewhat  larger  than  the  noise  temperature  of  good  receivers. 
The power received is kTAB ≅ 1.38×10-23×480×109  ≅ 6.6×10-12 watts.  This is a slight 
overestimate because the gain is actually slightly less than Go at the solar limb. 

Example 11.4C 
What  is  the  scattering  cross-section  σs  of  a  small  distant  flat  plate  of  area  F  oriented  so  as  to 
reflect incident radiation directly back toward the transmitter? 

Solution:	 The  radar  equation  (11.4.12)  relates  the  transmitted  power  Pt  to  that  received,  Pr,  in 
terms of σs.  A similar relation can be derived by treating the power reflected from the 
flat  plate  as  though  it  came  from  an  aperture  uniformly  illuminated  with  intensity 
PtGt/4πr2  [W m-2].  The  power Pr  received  by  the  radar  is  then  the  power  radiated  by 
the flat-plate aperture, FPtGt/4πr2 [W], inserted as Pt into the link expression (11.4.6): 
Pr =  (FPtGt/4πr2)GfAr/4πr2.  The gain of  the  flat plate aperture  is Gf = F4π/λ2, and Ar 
= Gλ2/4π,  so GfAr = GF.  Equating Pr  in  this  expression  to  that  in  the  radar  equation 
yields:  Ptσs(Gλ/4πr2)2/4π  =  (FPtGt/4πr2)GF/4πr2,  so σs  =  F(4πF/λ2).  Note σs  >>  F  if 
F  >>  λ2/4π.  Corner  reflectors  (three  flat  plates  at  right  angles  intersecting  so  as  to 
form one corner of a cube) reflect plane waves directly back toward their source if the 
waves  impact  the  concave  portion  of  the  reflector  from  any  angle.    Therefore  the 
corner  reflector becomes  a very  area-efficient  radar  target  if  its  total projected  area F 
is larger than λ2.
