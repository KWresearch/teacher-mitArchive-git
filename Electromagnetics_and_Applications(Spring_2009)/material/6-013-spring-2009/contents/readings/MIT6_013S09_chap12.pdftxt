Introduction to optical communication links 

12.1.1  Introduction to optical communications and photonics 

Optical  communications  is  as  ancient  as  signal  fires  and  mirrors  reflecting  sunlight,  but  it  is 
rapidly  being  modernized  by  photonics  that  integrate  optics  and  electronics  in  single  devices. 
Photonic  systems  are  usually  analyzed  in  terms  of  individual  photons,  although  wave  methods 
still  characterize  the  guidance  of  waves  through  optical  fibers,  space,  or  other  media.    This 
chapter introduces optical communications and applications of photonics in Section 12.1.  It then 
discusses  simple  optical  waveguides  in  Section  12.2,  lasers  in  Section  12.3,  and  representative 
components  of  optical  communications  systems  in  Sections  12.4,  including  photodetectors  in 
12.4.1-2, multiplexers in 12.4.3, interferometers in 12.4.4, and optical switches in 12.4.5. 

12.1.2  Applications of photonics 

Perhaps  the  single  most  important  application  of  photonics  today  is  to  optical  communications 
through  low-loss glass  fibers.   Since 1980  this development has dramatically  transformed global 
communications.  The  advantage  of  an  optical  fiber  for  communications  is  that  it  has  a 
bandwidth  of  approximately  one  terahertz,  and  can  propagate  signals  over  continental  and  even 
global  distances  when  assisted  by  optical  amplifiers.    These  amplifiers  are  currently  separated 
more than ~80 km, and this separation is steadily increasing as technology improves.  In contrast, 
coaxial  cable,  wire-pair,  and  wireless  links  at  radio  frequencies  still  dominate  most 
communication paths of bandwidth < ~2 MHz, provided the length is less than ~1–50 km. 

One broadband global wireless alternative  to optics  is microwave communications satellites 
in geosynchronous orbit66 that can service ships at sea and provide moveable capacity addressing 
transient  communications  shortfalls  or  failures  across  the  globe;  the  satellites  simply  point  their 
antenna beams at the new users, who can be over 10,000 km apart.  The greatest use of satellites, 
however,  is  for  broadcast  of  entertainment  over  continental  areas,  either  to  end-users  or  to  the 
head ends of cable distribution systems.  In general, the limited terrestrial radio spectrum is more 
efficiently  used  for  broadcast  than  for  one-to-one  communications  unless  there  is  re-use  of 
spectrum  as  described  in  Section  10.4.6.    Optical  techniques  are  disadvantaged  for  satellite-
ground  links  or  ground-to-ground  links  through  air  because  of  clouds  and  fog,  which  restrict 
such links to very short distances or to cases where spatial diversity67 offers clear-air alternatives. 

Optical  links  also  have  great  potential  for  very  broadband  inter-satellite  or  diversity-
protected  satellite-earth  communications  because  small  telescopes  easily  provide  highly  focused 
antenna  beams.    For  example,  beamwidths  of  telescopes with  5-inch  apertures  are  typically  one 

66 Geosynchronous satellites at 22,753-mile altitude orbit Earth once every 24 hours and can therefore hover  

stationary in the sky if they are in an equatorial orbit.  

67  Spatial  diversity  involves  use  of  spatially  distinct  communications  links  that  suffer  any  losses  independently;  

combining these signals in non-linear ways improves overall message reliability.

arc-second68,  corresponding  to  antenna  gains  of  ~4π×(57×3600)2  ≅  5×1011,  approximately  5000 
times  greater  than  is  achievable  by  all  but  the  very  best  radio  telescopes.   Such  optical  links  are 
discussed in Section 12.1.4. 

Optical  fibers  are  increasingly  being  used  for  much  shorter  links  too,  simply  because  their 
useable  bandwidth  can  readily  be  expanded  after  installation  and  because  they  are  cheaper  for 
larger bandwidths.   The distance between  successive  amplifiers  can  also be orders of magnitude 
greater  (compare  the  fiber  losses  of  Figure  12.2.6  with  those  of  wires,  as  discussed  in  Section 
7.1.4  and  Section  8.3.1).  The  bandwidth  per wire  is  generally  less  than  ~0.1 GHz  for  distances 
between  amplifiers  of  1  km,  whereas  a  single  optical  fiber  can  convey  ~1  THz  for  100  km  or 
more.  Extreme data  rates are now also being conveyed optically between and within computers 
and  even  chips,  although  wires  still  have  advantages  of  cost  and  simplicity  for  most  ultra-short 
and high-power applications. 

Optical  communication  is  not  the  only  application  for  photonics,  however.    Low-power 
lasers  are  used  in  everyday  devices  ranging  from  classroom  pointers  and  carpenters’  levels  to 
bar-code  readers,  laser  copiers  and  printers,  surgical  tools,  medical  and  environmental 
instruments, and DVD players and recorders.  Laser pulses lasting only 10-15 second (0.3 microns 
length)  are  used  for  biological  and  other  research.    High  power  lasers  with  tens  of  kilowatts  of 
average  power  are  used  for  cutting  and  other  manufacturing  purposes,  and  lasers  that  release 
their  stored  energy  in  sub-picosecond  intervals  can  focus  and  compress  their  energy  to  achieve 
intensities of ~1023 W/m2  for  research or,  for example,  to drive small  thermonuclear  reactions  in 
compressed  pellets.   Moreover,  new  applications  are  constantly  being  developed with  no  end  in 
sight. 

12.1.3  Link equations 

The link equations governing through-the-air optical communications are essentially the same as 
those  governing  radio,  as  described  in  Section  10.3.    That  is,  the  received  power  Pr  is  simply 
related  to  the  transmitted  power  Pt  by  the  gain  and  effective  area  of  the  transmitting  and 
receiving antennas, Gt and Ae: 

P  = (G P
t  πr  )A e  [W]

(optical link equation) 

(12.1.1)

The  gain  and  effective  area  of  single-mode  optical  antennas  are  related  by  the  same  equation 
governing radio waves, (10.3.23): 

G 4= πA  λ 2 

(12.1.2)
 

Some optical detectors intercept multiple independent waves or modes, and their powers add.  In 
this  case,  the  gain  and  effective  area  of  any  single  mode  are  then  less  relevant,  as  discussed  in 
Section 12.1.4. 

68 One arc-second is 1/60 arc-minutes, 1/602 degrees, 1/(57.3×3600) radians, or 1/60 of the largest apparent 
diameters of Venus or Jupiter in the night sky.

The maximum bit rate that can be communicated over an optical link is not governed by the 
Eb  >  ~10-20  Joules-per-bit  limit  characteristic  of  radio  systems,  however,  but  rather  by  the 
number  of  photons  the  receiver  requires  per  bit  of  information,  perhaps  ~10  for  a  typical  good 
system.    Each  photon  has  energy  E  =  hf  Joules.    Thus  to  receive  R  bits/second  might  require 
received power of: 

P r = E b R  ≅ 10hfR  [W]

 

(optical rate approximation) 

(12.1.3)

where  h  is  Planck’s  constant  (6.624×10-34)  and  f  is  photon  frequency  [Hz].    Clever  design  can 
enable many bits to be communicated per photon, as discussed in the following section. 

12.1.4  Examples of optical communications systems 

Three  examples  illustrate  several  of  the  issues  inherent  in  optical  communications  systems:  a 
trans-oceanic  optical  fiber  cable,  an  optical  link  to  Mars,  and  an  incoherent  intra-office  link 
carrying computer information. 

First consider a trans-oceanic optical fiber.  Section 12.2.2 discusses losses in optical fibers, 
which can be as  low as ~0.2 dB/km near 1.5-micron wavelength  (f ≅  2×1014 Hz).   To ensure  the  
signal (zeros and ones) remains unambiguous, each link of an R = 1-Gbps fiber link must deliver 
to  its  receiver  or  amplifier  more  than  ~10hfR  watts,  or  ~10×6×10-34×2×1014×109  ≅  1.2×10-9 
watts; a more  typical design might deliver ~10-6 watts because errors accumulate and equipment 
can degrade.  If one watt  is  transmitted and10-6 watts  is  received,  then  the associated 60-dB  loss 
corresponds  to  300  km  of  fiber  propagation  between  optical  amplifiers,  and  perhaps  ~20 
amplifiers  across  the  Atlantic  Ocean  per  fiber.    In  practice,  erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers, 
discussed in Section 12.3.1, are now spaced approximately 80 km apart. 

Next  consider  an  optical  link  communicating  between  Earth  and  astronauts  on  Mars. 
Atmospheric diffraction or “seeing” limits the focusing ability of terrestrial telescopes larger than 
~10  cm,  but  Mars  has  little  atmosphere.    Therefore  a  Martian  optical  link  might  employ  the 
equivalent  of  a  one-square-meter  optical  telescope  on Mars  and  the  equivalent  of  10-cm-square 
optics  on  Earth.    It  might  also  employ  a  one-watt  laser  transmitter  on  Earth  operating  at  0.5­
micron  wavelength,  in  the  visible  region.    The  nominal  link  and  rate  equations,  (12.1.1)  and 
(12.1.3), yield the maximum data rate R possible at a range of ~1011 meters (approximate closest 
approach of Mars to Earth):

(12.1.4)

The gain G  of the transmitter given by (12.1.2) is G ≅ 4πA/λ2  ≅ 5×1011, where A ≅ (0.1)2
 and λ 
t
t 
≅ 5×10-7 [m].  The frequency f = c/λ = 3×108/[5×10-7] = 6×1014.  Therefore (12.1.4) becomes:

(12.1.5)

Table 11.4.1 suggests  that  this data rate  is adequate for full-motion video of modest quality. 
The  delay  of  the  signal  each  way  is  τ  =  r/c  =  1011/[3×108]  seconds  ≅  5.6  minutes,  impeding 
conversation.  This  delay  becomes  several  times  greater when Mars  is  on  the  far  side  of  the  sun 
from Earth, and the data rate R would then drop by more than a factor of ten. 

This  1-Mbps  result  (12.1.5)  assumed  10  photons  were  required  per  bit  of  information. 
However  this  can  be  reduced  below  one  photon  per  bit  by  using  pulse-position  modulation. 
Suppose ~106  1-nsec  10-photon  pulses were  received  per  second, where  each  pulse  could  arrive 
in any of 1024  time slots because  the ratio of pulse width to average inter-pulse spacing  is 1024. 
This timing information conveys ten bits of  information per pulse because  log21024 = 10.  Since 
each 10-photon pulse conveys 10 bits of  information,  the average  is one bit per photon received. 
With  more  time  slots  still  fewer  photons  per  bit  would  be  required.    If  a  tunable  laser  can 
transmit each pulse at any of 1024 colors, for example, then another factor of 10 can be achieved.  
Use  of  both  pulse  position  and  pulse-frequency  modulation  can  permit  more  than  10  bits  to  be 
communicated per photon on average. 

The final example is that of a 1-mW laser diode transmitting digitally modulated light at λ = 
5×10-7 [m] isotropically within a large office over ranges r up to 10 meters, where the light might 
travel  directly  to  the  isotropic  receiver  or  bounce  off  walls  and  the  ceiling  first.    Such  optical 
communications  systems  might  link  computers,  printers,  personal  digital  assistants  (pda’s),  and 
other  devices  within  the  room.    In  this  case  G   =  1  and  A   =  Gλ2/4π  =  (5×10-7 2
) /4π ≅  2×10-14

The  fact  that  we  can  send  106  bits  per  second  to  Mars  with  a  one-watt  transmitter,  but  only  4 
millibits per second across a room with a milliwatt, may conflict with intuition. 

(12.1.6) 

The  resolution  of  this  seeming  paradox  lies  in  the  assumption  that  the  receiver  in  this 
example  is  a  single  mode  device  like  that  of  typical  radio  receivers  or  the  Martian  optical 
receiver considered above.  If this room-link receiver were isotropic and intercepted only a single 
mode,  its  effective  area  Ae  given  by  (12.1.2)  would  be  2×10-14  [m2].  The  tiny  effective  area  of 
such  low-gain  coherent  optical  antennas  motivates  use  of  incoherent  photodetectors  instead, 
which  respond  well  to  the  total  photon  flux  from  all  directions  of  arrival.    For  example,  intra-
room  optical  links  of  this  type  are  commonly  used  for  remote  control  of  many  consumer 
electronic  devices,  but  with  a  much  larger  multimode  antenna  (photodiode)  of  area 
A  ≅  2×10-6  [m2]  instead  of  2×10-14.  This  “antenna”  is  typically  responsive  to  all  photons 
impacting  its  area  that  arrive  within  roughly  one  steradian.    That  is,  a  photodetector  generally 
intercepts  all  photons  impacting  it,  even  though  those  photons  are  incoherent  with  each  other. 
Thus  the  solution  (12.1.6)  is  increased  by  a  factor  of  10-6/10-14  if  a  two-square-millimeter 
photodetector  replaces  the  single-mode  antenna,  and  R  then  becomes  0.4 Mbps,  which  is  more 
capacity  than  normally  required.    In  practice  such  inexpensive  area  detectors  are  noisier  and 
require  orders  of  mangitude  more  photons  per  bit.    Better  semiconductor  detectors  can  achieve 
10  photons  per  bit  or  better,  however,  particularly  at  visible  wavelengths  and  if  stray  light  at 
other wavelengths is filtered out.

12.2  Optical waveguides 

12.2.1  Dielectric slab waveguides 

Optical  waveguides  such  as  optical  fibers  typically  trap  and  guide  light  within  rectangular  or 
cylindrical  boundaries  over  useful  distances.    Rectangular  shapes  are  easier  to  implement  on 
integrated circuits, while cylindrical shapes are used for  longer distances, up  to 100 km or more. 
Exact  wave  solutions  for  such  structures  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  text,  but  the  same  basic 
principles  are  evident  in  dielectric  slab  waveguides  for  which  the  derivations  are  simpler. 
Dielectric  slab  waveguides  consist  of  an  infinite  flat  dielectric  slab  of  thickness  2d  and 
permittivity  ε  imbedded  in  an  infinite  medium  of  lower  permittivity  εo,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
12.2.1(a)  for  a  slab  of  finite  width  in  the  y  direction.    For  simplicity  we  here  assume  μ  =  μo 
everywhere, which is usually the case in practice too.

Figure 12.2.1  Dielectric slab waveguide and TE mode structure. 
 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.2.3,  uniform  plane  waves  within  the  dielectric  are  perfectly 
reflected at the slab boundary if they are incident beyond the critical angle θc = sin-1(cε/co), where 
cε  and  co  are  the velocities of  light  in  the dielectric  and outside,  respectively.    Such  a wave  and 
 
its  perfect  reflection  propagate  together  along  the  z  axis  and  form  a  standing  wave  in  the 
orthogonal  x  direction.  Outside  the  waveguide  the  waves  are  evanescent  and  decay 
exponentially away from the guide, as illustrated in Figure 12.2.2.  This figure portrays the fields 
inside and outside the lower half of a dielectric slab having ε > εo; the lower boundary is at x = 0.  
The  figure  suggests  two possible positions  for  the upper  slab boundary  that  satisfy  the boundary 
conditions for the TE1 and TE2 modes.  Note that the TE1 mode waveguide can be arbitrarily thin 
relative  to  λ  and  still  satisfy  the  boundary  conditions.  The  field  configurations  above  the  upper 
boundary  mirror  the  fields  below  the  lower  boundary,  but  are  not  illustrated  here.    These 
waveguide modes are designated TEn because the electric field is only transverse to the direction 
of  propagation,  and  there  is  part  of  n  half-wavelengths  within  the  slab.    The  orthogonal  modes 
(not illustrated) are designated TMn.

Figure 12.2.2  Fields in dielectric slab waveguides for TEn modes. 
 

The  fields  inside  a  dielectric  slab  waveguide  have  the  same  form  as  (9.3.6)  and  (9.3.7)  inside 
parallel-plate  waveguides,  although  the  boundary  positions  are  different;  also  see  Figures  9.3.1 
and  9.3.3.  If  we  define  x  =  0  at  the  axis  of  symmetry,  and  the  thickness  of  the  guide  to  be  2d, 
then within the guide the electric field for TE modes is:

The  first  and  second  options  in  braces  correspond  to  anti-symmetric  and  symmetric  TE  modes,

combination  with  (12.2.1),  (12.2.2),  and  (12.2.3)  yields  the  corresponding magnetic  field  inside

The  TE1 mode  has  the  interesting  property  that  it  approaches  TEM  behavior  as ω → 0  and 
the  decay  length  approaches  infinity;  most  of  the  energy  is  then  propagating  outside  the  slab 
even  though  the  mode  is  guided  by  it.    Modes  with  n  ≥  2  have  non-zero  cut-off  frequencies. 
There is no TM mode that propagates for f→0 in dielectric slab waveguides, however.   

Although Figure 12.2.1(a) portrays a slab with an insulating medium outside, the first option 
in brackets {•} for  the field solutions above  is also consistent for x > 0 with a slab  located 0 < x 
<  d  and  having  a  perfectly  conducting wall  at  x =  0;  all  boundary  conditions  are matched;  these 
are  the  anti-symmetric  TE  modes.    This  configuration  corresponds,  for  example,  to  certain 
optical guiding structures overlaid on conductive semiconductors. 

To  complete  the  TE  field  solutions  above  we  need  additional  relations  between  Eo  and  E1, 
and  between  kx  and  α.  Matching  E   at  x  =  d  for  the  symmetric  solution  [cos  kxx  in  (12.2.1)] 
yields:

The  guidance  condition  for  the  symmetric  TE  dielectric  slab  waveguide  modes  is  given  by  the 
ratio of (12.2.8) to (12.2.7): 

k dx  tan  ( k  x d  ) = αd

the  slab  dispersion  relation  (12.2.12)  we  obtain  a  transcendental  guidance  equation  that  can  be

Note  that  the TE1 mode can be trapped and propagate at all frequencies, from nearly zero to 
infinity.  At low frequencies the waves guided by the slab have small values of α and decay very 
slowly  away  from  the  slab  so  that  most  of  the  energy  is  actually  propagating  in  the  z  direction 
outside  the  slab  rather  than  inside.    The  value  of  α  can  be  found  from  (12.2.12),  and  it 
approaches zero as both kxd and ω approach zero.

occurs when kxd = π, as suggested by Figure 12.2.3; ωTE3 can be determined by solving (12.2.12) 
for  this  case.  This  and  all  higher modes  cannot  be  trapped  at  low  frequencies  because  then  the 
plane waves  that comprise  them  impact the slab wall at angles beyond θc  that permit escape.   As 
ω  increases,  more  modes  can  propagate.    Figures  12.2.2  and  12.2.1(b)  illustrate  symmetric  TE1 
and TE3 modes,  and  the  antisymmetric TE2 mode.   Similar  figures  could  be  constructed  for TM 
modes. 

These  solutions  for dielectric-slab waveguides are  similar  to  the  solutions  for optical  fibers, 
which  instead  take  the  form  of  Bessel  functions  because  of  their  cylindrical  geometry.    In  both 
cases  we  have  lateral  standing  waves  propagating  inside  and  evanescent  waves  propagating 
outside. 

12.2.2  Optical fibers 

An  optical  fiber  is  generally  a  very  long  solid  glass  wire  that  traps  lightwaves  inside  as  do  the 
dielectric slab waveguides described in Section 12.2.1.  Fiber lengths can be tens of kilometers or 

- 376 -


more.    Because  the  fiber  geometry  is  cylindrical,  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  inside  and 
outside  the  fiber  are  characterized  by  Bessel  functions,  which  we  do  not  address  here.  These 
propagating  electromagnetic  fields  exhibit  lateral  standing  waves  inside  the  fiber  and 
evanescence outside.   To minimize  loss  the fiber core  is usually overlaid with a  low-permittivity 
glass cladding so that the evanescent decay also occurs within low-loss glass. 

A  typical  glass  optical  fiber  transmission  line  is  perhaps  125  microns  in  diameter  with  a 
high-permittivity  glass  core  having  diameter  ~6  microns.    The  core  permittivity  ε  +  Δε  is 
typically  ~2  percent  greater  than  that  of  the  cladding    (ε).    If  the  lightwaves  within  the  core 
impact the cladding beyond the critical angle θc, where: 

1 
θ = sin −  (ε  ε + Δε  ) 
)
(
c 

(12.2.14)

then  these waves  are  perfectly  reflected  and  trapped.   The  evanescent waves  inside  the  cladding 
decay approximately exponentially away from  the core  to negligible values at  the outer cladding 
boundary, which is often encased in plastic about 0.1 mm thick that may be reinforced.  Graded-
index fibers have a graded transition in permittivity between  the core and cladding.   Some fibers 
propagate  multiple  modes  that  travel  at  different  velocities  so  as  to  interfere  at  the  output  and 
limit information extraction (data rate).  Multiple fibers are usually bundled inside a single cable. 
Figure 12.2.4 suggests the structure of a typical fiber.

Figure 12.2.5 shows four common forms of optical fiber; many others exist.  The multimode 
fiber is thicker and propagates several modes, while the single-mode fiber is so thin that only one 
mode can propagate.  The diameter of the core determines the number of propagating modes.  In 
all  cylindrical  structures,  even  single-mode  fibers,  both  vertically  and  horizontally  polarized 
waves can propagate independently and therefore may interfere with each other when detected at 
the output.  If a single-mode fiber has an elliptical cross-section, one polarization can be made to 
escape so  the signal becomes pure.   That  is, one polarization decays more slowly away  from  the 
core so that it sees more of the absorbing material that surrounds the cladding.

The  initial  issue  faced  in  the  1970’s  by  designers  of  optical  fibers  was  propagation  loss. 
Most  serious  was  absorption  due  to  residual  levels  of  impurities  in  the  glass,  so  much  research 
and  development  involved  purification.    Water  posed  a  particularly  difficult  problem  because 
one  of  its  harmonics  fell  in  the  region  where  attenuation  in  glass  was  otherwise  minimum,  as 
suggested in Figure 12.2.6.

Figure 12.2.6  Loss mechanisms in optical fibers. 
 

At wavelengths shorter than ~1.5 microns the losses are dominated by Rayleigh scattering of the 
waves  from  the  random  fluctuations  in  glass  density  on  atomic  scales.    These  scattered  waves 
exit  the  fiber  at  angles  less  than  the  critical  angle.    Rayleigh  scattering  is  proportional  to  f4  and 
occurs  when  the  inhomogeneities  in  ε  are  small  compared  to  λ/2π.  Inhomogeneities  in  glass 
fibers have near-atomic scales, say 1 nm, whereas the wavelength is more than 1000 times larger. 
Rayleigh scattering losses are reduced by minimizing unnecessary inhomogeneities through glass 
purification and careful mixing, and by decreasing the critical angle.  Losses due to scattering by 
rough  fiber  walls  are  small  because  drawn  glass  fibers  can  be  very  smooth  and  little  energy 
impacts the walls. 

At  wavelengths  longer  than  ~1.5  microns  the  wings  of  infrared  absorption  lines  at  lower 
frequencies  begin  to  dominate.    This  absorption  is  due  principally  to  the  vibration  spectra  of 
inter-atomic  bonds,  and  is  unavoidable.    The  resulting  low-attenuation  band  centered  near  1.5­
microns  between  the Rayleigh  and  IR  attenuating  regions  is  about  20 THz wide,  sufficient  for  a 
single fiber to provide each person in the U.S.A. with a bandwidth of 20×1012/2.5×108 = 80 kHz, 
or  15  private  telephone  channels!  Most  fibers  used  for  local  distribution  do  not  operate 
anywhere  close  to  this  limit  for  lack  of  demand,  although  some  undersea  cables  are  pushing 
toward it. 

The  fibers  are  usually  manufactured  first  as  a  preform,  which  is  a  glass  rod  that 
subsequently can be heated at one end and drawn  into a  fiber of  the desired  thickness.   Preforms 
are  either  solid  or  hollow.  The  solid  ones  are  usually  made  by  vapor  deposition  of  SiO2  and 
GeO2 on  the outer surface of  the  initial core  rod, which might be a millimeter  thick.   By varying 
the  mixture  of  gases,  usually  Si(Ge)Cl4  +  O2  ⇒  Si(Ge)O2  +  2Cl2,  the  permittivity  of  the 
deposited  glass  cladding  can  be  reduced  about  2  percent  below  that  of  the  core.    The  boundary 
between  core  and  cladding  can  be  sharp  or  graded  in  a  controlled  way.    Alternatively,  the 
preform  cladding  is  large  and  hollow,  and  the  core  is  deposited  from  the  inside  by  hot  gases  in 

- 378 -


the  same  way;  upon  completion  there  is  still  a  hole  through  the  middle  of  the  fiber.    Since  the 
core  is small compared  to  the cladding,  the preforms can be made more  rapidly  this way.   When 
the  preform  is  drawn  into  a  fiber,  any  hollow  core  vanishes.    Sometimes  a  hollow  core  is  an 
advantage.  For  example,  some  newer  types  of  fibers  have  cores with  laterally-periodic  lossless 
longitudinal hollows within which much of the energy can propagate. 

Another  major  design  issue  involves  the  fiber  dispersion  associated  with  frequency-
dependent  phase  and  group  velocities, where  the  phase  velocity  vp  =  ω/k.    If  the  group  velocity 
vg,  which  is  the  velocity  of  the  envelope  of  a  narrowband  sinusoid,  varies  over  the  optical 
bandwidth,  then  the  signal waveform will  increasingly distort as  it propagates because  the  faster 
moving  frequency components of  the envelope will arrive early.   For example, a digital pulse of 
light  that  lasts  T  seconds  is  produced  by  multiplying  a  boxcar  modulation  envelope  (the  T-
second  pulse  shape)  by  the  sinusoidal  optical  carrier,  so  the  frequency  spectrum  is  the 
convolution  of  the  spectrum  for  the  sinusoid  (a  spectral  impulse)  and  the  spectrum  for  a  boxcar 
pulse  (∝ [sin(2πt/T)]/[2πt/T]).  The  outermost  frequencies  suffer  from  dispersion  the  most,  and 
these are primarily associated with the sharp edges of the pulse. 

The group velocity vg derived in (9.5.20) is the slope of the dispersion relation at the optical 
frequency of interest: 

vg  = ∂( k  ∂  −ω) 1 

(12.2.15)
 

Figure 12.2.7 illustrates the dispersion relation for  three different modes;  the higher order modes 
propagate information more slowly.

The  group  velocity  vg  is  the  slope  of  the  ω(k)  relation  and  is  bounded  by  the  slopes  associated 
with  the  core  (vgcore)  and  with  the  cladding  (vgcladding),  where  the  cladding  is  assumed  to  be 
infinite.  The  figure  has  greatly  exaggerated  the  difference  in  the  slope  between  the  core  and 
cladding for illustrative purposes.

A  dispersive  line  eventually  transforms  a  square  optical  pulse  into  a  long  “frequency 
chirped”  pulse  with  the  faster  propagating  frequencies  in  the  front  and  the  slower  propagating 
frequencies in the back.  This problem can be minimized by carefully choosing combinations of: 
1)  the dispersion n(f) of  the glass, 2)  the permittivity  contour ε(r)  in  the  fiber,  and 3)  the optical 
center  frequency  fo.  Otherwise we must  reduce  either  the  bandwidth  of  the  signal  or  the  length 
of  the  fiber.    To  increase  the  distance  between  amplifiers  the  dispersion  can  be  compensated 
periodically by special fibers or other elements with opposite dispersion. 

Pulses  spread  as  they  propagate  over  distance  L  because  their  outermost  frequency 
components ω1 and ω2 = ω1+Δω have arrival times at the output separated by:

This  natural  fiber  dispersion  can,  however,  help  solve  the  problem  of  fiber  nonlinearity. 
Since  attenuation  is  always  present  in  the  fibers,  the  amplifiers  operate  at  high  powers,  limited 
partly by their own nonlinearities and those in the fiber that arise because ε depends very slightly 
on the field strength E.  The effects of non-linearities are more severe when the signals are in the 
form  of  isolated  high-energy  pulses.    Deliberately  dispersing  and  spreading  the  isolated  pulses 
before  amplifying  and  introducing  them  to  the  fiber  reduces  their  peak  amplitudes  and  the 
resulting  nonlinear  effects.  This  pre-dispersion  is  made  opposite  to  that  of  the  fiber  so  that  the 
fiber  dispersion  gradually  compensates  for  the  pre-dispersion  over  the  full  length  of  the  fiber. 
That is, if the fiber propagates high frequencies faster, then those high frequency components are 
delayed correspondingly before being  introduced  to  the  fiber.   When  the pulses  reappear  in  their 
original  sharp  form  at  the  far  end  of  the  fiber  their  peak  amplitudes  are  so  weak  from  natural 
attenuation that they no longer drive the fiber nonlinear. 

Example 12.2A 
If 10-ps pulses are used  to  transmit data at 20 Gbps,  they would be spaced 5×10-10 sec apart and 
would  therefore begin  to  interfere with  each other  after propagating  a distance Lmax  sufficient  to 
spread  those  pulses  to  widths  of  50  ps.  A  standard  single-mode  optical  fiber  has  dispersion 
d2k/dω2 of 20 ps2/km  at 1.5 μm wavelength.   At what distance Lmax will  such 10-ps pulses have 
broadened to 50 ps? 

Solution:  Using (12.2.16) and Δω ≅ T -1 
p we find: 

Lmax = Δt/[Δω(d2k/dω2)] = 50 ps × 10 ps /(20 ps2/km) = 25 km 

Thus we must slow this fiber to 10 Gbps if the amplifiers are 50 km apart.

12.3  Lasers 

12.3.1  Physical principles of stimulated emission and laser amplification 

Lasers  (Light  Amplification  by  Stimulated  Emission  of  Radiation)  amplify  electromagnetic 
waves  at wavelengths  ranging  from  radio  to  ultraviolet  and  x-rays.   They were  originally  called 
masers  because  the  first  units  amplified  only  microwaves.    Lasers  can  also  oscillate  when  the 
amplified  waves  are  reflected  back  into  the  device.    The  physical  principles  are  similar  at  all 
wavelengths, though the details differ.  Laser processes can occur in solids, liquids, or gases. 

Lasers  have  a  wide  and  growing  array  of  applications.    For  example,  optical  fiber 
communications  systems  today  commonly  use  Erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers  (EDFA’s)  that 
amplify ~1.5-micron wavelength signals having bandwidths up  to ~4 THz.   Semiconductor, gas, 
and  glass  fiber  laser  amplifiers  are  also  used  to  communicate within  single  pieces  of  equipment 
and  for  local  fiber  or  free-space  communications.  Lasers  also  generate  coherent  beams  of  light 
used  for measuring distances and angles;  recording and  reading data  from memory devices  such 
as CD’s  and DVD’s;  and  for  cutting, welding,  and  shaping materials,  including  even  the  human 
eye.  Laser  pointers  have  been  added  to  pocket  pens while  higher-power  industrial  units  can  cut 
steel plates  several  inches  thick.   Weapons  and  laser-driven nuclear  fusion  reactions  require  still 
higher-power  lasers.  Peak  laser  pulse  powers  can  exceed  1015 watts,  a  thousand  times  the  total 
U.S.  electrical  generating  capacity  of  ~5×1011  watts.  The  electric  field  strengths  within  a  focal 
spot  of  <100-micron  diameter  can  strip  electrons  from  atoms  and  accelerate  them  to  highly 
relativistic  velocities  within  a  single  cycle  of  the  radiation.    The  roles  of  lasers  in  science, 
medicine, industry, consumer products, and other fields are still being defined. 

Laser  operation  depends  intimately  upon  the  quantum  nature  of  matter  and  the  fact  that 
charges  trapped  in  atoms  and  molecules  generally  move  at  constant  energy  without  radiating. 
Instead,  transitions  between  atomic  or  molecular  energy  states  occur  abruptly,  releasing  or 
absorbing  a  photon.69    This  process  and  lasers  can  fortunately  be  understood  semi-classically 
without reference to a full quantum description. 

Electrons  within  atoms,  molecules,  and  crystals  occupy  discrete  energy  states;  the  lower 
energy  states  are  preferentially  occupied.    Energy  states  can  also  be  vibrational,  rotational, 
magnetic,  chemical,  nuclear,  etc.70   The  number  of  possible  states  greatly  exceeds  those  that  are 
occupied. 

69 Alternatively, acoustic phonons with energy hf can be  released or absorbed, or an additional molecular or atomic 
state  transition  can  occur  to  conserve  energy.    Phonons  are  acoustic  quanta  associated  with  mechanical  waves  in 
materials.  Optical  transitions can also absorb or emit  two photons with  total energy equal  to Ε2 − Ε1, although such 
two-photon transitions are much less likely. 
70  The  distances  between  adjacent  nuclei  in  molecules  can  oscillate  sinusoidally  with  quantized  amplitudes  and 
frequencies  characterisitic  of  each  vibrational  state. 
Isolated  molecules  can  spin  at  specific  frequencies 
corresponding to various rotational energy states.  Electron spins and orbits together have magnetic dipole moments 
that align with or oppose an applied magnetic  field  to a quantized degree.   Atoms bond  to one another  in quantized 
ways  having  specific  chemical  consequences.  Nuclear  magnetic  moments  can  also  align  with  other  atomic  or 
molecular magnetic moments in quantized ways corresponding to discrete energy states. 

- 381 -


For example, as  illustrated  in Figure 12.3.1(a), an electron  trapped  in an atom, molecule, or 
crystal  with  energy  E1  can  be  excited  into  any  vacant  higher-energy  state  (E2)  by  absorbing  a 
photon of frequency f and energy ΔE where:

Figure 12.3.1  Photon absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission. 
 

Figures  12.3.1(b)  and  (c)  illustrate  two  additional  basic photon  processes:  spontaneous  emission 
and  stimulated  emission.  Photon  absorption  (a)  occurs  with  a  probability  that  depends  on  the 
photon  flux  density  [Wm-2],  frequency  [Hz],  and  the  cross-section  for  the  energy  transition  of 
interest.  Spontaneous  emission  of photons  (b) occurs with  a probability A  that depends only on 
the  transition,  as  discussed  below.    Stimulated  emission  (c)  occurs  when  an  incoming  photon 
triggers emission of a second photon; the emitted photon is always exactly in phase with the first, 
and  propagates  in  the  same  direction.    Laser  action  depends  entirely  on  this  third  process  of 
stimulated emission, while the first two processes often weaken it. 

The  net  effect  of  all  three  processes—absorption,  spontaneous  emission,  and  stimulated 
emission—is to alter the relative populations, N1 and N2, of the two energy levels of interest.  An 
example  exhibiting  these  processes  is  the  Erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers  commonly  used  to 
amplify  optical  telecommunications  signals  near  1.4-micron  wavelength  on  long  lines.    Figure 
12.3.2  illustrates  how  an  optical  fiber  with  numerous  atoms  excited  by  an  optical  pump 
(discussed further below) can amplify input signals at the proper frequency.  Since the number of 
excited  atoms  stimulated  to  emit  is  proportional  to  the  input  wave  intensity,  perhaps  only  one 
atom might  be  stimulated  to  emit  initially  (because  the  input  signal  is weak),  producing  two  in­
phase  photons—the  original  plus  the  one  stimulated.    These  two  then  propagate  further 
stimulating two emissions so as to yield four in-phase photons.

This  exponential  growth  continues  until  the  pump  can  no  longer  empty E1  and  refill E2  fast 
enough;  as  a  result  absorption  [m-1]  approaches  emission  [m-1]  as N1  approaches N2  locally.  In 
this  limit  the  increase  in  the  number  of  photons  per  unit  length  is  limited  by  the  number  np  of 
electrons  pumped  from  E1  to  E2  per  unit  length.    Thereafter  the  signal  strength  then  increases 
only  linearly  with  distance  rather  than  exponentially,  as  suggested  in  Figure  12.3.3;  the  power 
increase per unit length then approaches nphf [Wm-1].

The  probability  of  spontaneous  emission  from  E2  to  E1  is  A21,  where  τ21  =  1/A21  is  the  1/e

corresponds  to  the  difference  between  the  number  of  stimulated  emissions  (∝  N2)  and 
absorptions (∝ N1), where the rate coefficients are:

In  these  equations  n  is  the  index  of  refraction  of  the  fiber  and  D21  is  the  quantum  mechanical 
electric or magnetic dipole moment specific to the state-pair 2,1.  It is the sharply varying values 
of  the  dipole  moment  Dij  from  one  pair  of  levels  to  another  that  makes  pumping  practical,  as 
explained below. 

Laser amplification can occur only when N2 exceeds N1, but in a two-level system no pump 
excitation  can  accomplish  this;  even  infinitely  strong  incident  radiation  I21  at  the  proper 
frequency  can  only  equalize  the  two  populations  via  (12.3.2).71    Instead,  three-  or  four-level 
lasers  are  generally  used.  The  general  principle  is  illustrated  by  the  three-level  laser  of  Figure 
12.3.4(a), for which the optical laser pump radiation driving the 1,3 transition is so strong that it 
roughly  equalizes N1  and N3.  The  key  to  this  laser  is  that  the  spontaneous  rate  of  emission A32 
>> A21 so that all the active atoms quickly accumulate in the metastable long-lived level 2 in the 
absence of stimulation at f21.  This generally requires D32 >> D21, and finding materials with such 
properties for a desired laser frequency can be challenging.

Since  it  requires  hf13  Joules  to  raise  each  atom  to  level  3,  and  only  hf21  Joules  emerges  as 
amplified  additional  radiation,  the  power  efficiency  η  (power  out/power  in)  cannot  exceed  the 
intrinsic  limit  ηI  =  f21/f31. 
In  fact  the  efficiency  is  lowered  further  by  a  factor  of  ηA 
corresponding  to  spontaneous  emission  from  level  3  directly  to  level  1,  bypassing  level  2  as 
suggested  in  Figure  12.3.4(b),  and  to  the  spontaneous  decay  rate  A21  which  produces  radiation 
that  is  not  coherent  with  the  incoming  signal  and  radiates  in  all  directions.    Finally,  only  a 
fraction ηp of  the pump photons are absorbed by  the  transition 1→2.  Thus  the maximum power 
efficiency for this laser in the absence of propagation losses is: 

η = ηI Aη  η p

(12.3.6)

71  Two-level  lasers  have  been  built,  however,  by  physically  separating  the  excited  atoms  or  molecules  from  the 
unexcited  ones.    For  example,  excited  ammonia molecules  can  be  separated  from  unexcited  ones  by  virtue  of  their 
difference in deflection when a beam of such atoms in vacuum passes through an electric field gradient.

Figure 12.3.4(c)  suggests a  typical design  for a  four-level  laser, where both A32 and A41 are 
much  greater  than  A24  or  A21  so  that  energy  level  2  is  metastable  and  most  atoms  accumulate 
there  in  the  absence  of  strong  radiation  at  frequency  f24  or  f21.  The  strong  pump  radiation  can 
come  from  a  laser,  flash  lamp,  or  other  strong  radiation  source.    Sunlight,  chemical  reactions, 
nuclear radiation, and electrical currents in gases pump some systems. 

The  ω3  dependence  of  A21  (12.3.5)  has  a  profound  effect  on  maser  and  laser  action.    For 
example,  any  two-level maser  or  laser must  excite  enough  atoms  to  level  2  to  equal  the  sum  of 
the stimulated and spontaneous decay rates.  Since the spontaneous decay rate increases with ω3, 
the  pump  power  must  also  increase  with  ω3  times  the  energy  hf  of  each  excited  photon.    Thus 
pump  power  requirements  increase  very  roughly  with  ω4,  making  construction  of  x-ray  or 
gamma-ray  lasers  extremely  difficult  without  exceptionally  high  pump  powers;  even  ultraviolet 
lasers pose a challenge.   Conversely, at  radio wavelengths  the  spontaneous  rates of decay are  so 
extremely  small  that  exceedingly  low  pump  powers  suffice,  as  they  sometimes  do  in  the  vast 
darkness of interstellar space.

  Many  types  of  astrophysical  masers  exist  in  low-density  interstellar  gases  containing H2O, 
OH, CO,  and  other molecules.   They  are  typically  pumped  by  radiation  from  nearby  stars  or  by 
collisions  occurring  in  shock  waves.    Sometimes  these  lasers  radiate  radially  from  stars, 
amplifying  starlight,  and  sometimes  they  spontaneously  radiate  tangentially  along  linear 
circumstellar  paths  that  have  minimal  relative  Doppler  shifts.    Laser  or  maser  action  can  also 
occur  in  darkness  far  from  stars  as  a  result  of  molecular  collisions.    The  detailed  frequency, 
spatial,  and  time  structures  observed  in  astrophysical  masers  offer  unique  insights  into  a  wide 
range of astrophysical phenomena. 

Example 12.3A 
What  is  the  ratio  of  laser  output  power  to  pump  power  for  a  three-level  laser  like  that  shown  in 
Figure  12.3.4(a)  if:  1)  all  pump  power  is  absorbed  by  the  1→3  transition,  2)  N2  >>  N1,  3) 
A21/I21B21 = 0.1, 4) A31 = 0.1A32, and 5) f31 = 4f21? 

Solution:	 The  desired  ratio  is  the  efficiency  η  of  (12.3.6)  where  the  intrinsic  efficiency  is 
ηI  =  f21/f31  =  0.25,  and  the  pump  absorption  efficiency  ηp  =  1.  The  efficiency  ηA  is 
less  than  unity  because  of  two  small  energy  losses:  the  ratio  A31/A32  =  0.1,  and  the 
ratio  A21/I21B21  =  0.1.  Therefore  ηA  =  0.92  =  0.81,  and  η  =  ηIηAηp  =  0.25  ×  0.81  ≅ 
0.20. 

12.3.2  Laser oscillators 

Laser  amplifiers  oscillate  nearly  monochromatically  if  an  adequate  fraction  of  the    amplified 
signal  is  reflected  back  to  be  amplified  further.    For  example,  the  laser  oscillator  pictured  in 
Figure  12.3.5  has  parallel mirrors  at  both  ends  of  a  laser  amplifier,  separated  by L meters.   One 
mirror  is perfect and  the other  transmits a  fraction T  (say ~0.1) of  the  incident  laser power.   The 
roundtrip  gain  in  the  absence  of  loss  is  e2gL.  This  system  oscillates  if  the  net  roundtrip  gain  at 
any  frequency  exceeds  unity,  where  round-trip  absorption  (e-2αL)  and  the  partially  transmitting 
mirror account for most loss.

Amplifiers  at  the  threshold  of  oscillation  are  usually  in  their  exponential  region,  so  this  net 
roundtrip gain exceeds unity when:

(12.3.7) 

Equation  (12.3.7)  implies  e2(g  - α)L  ≥  (1-T)-1  for  oscillation  to  occur.  Generally  the  gain  g  per 
meter is designed to be as high as practical, and then L and T are chosen to be consistent with the 
desired output power.  The pump power must be above the minimum threshold that yields g > α. 

The output power  from  such an oscillator  is  simply Pout = TP+ watts,  and depends on pump 
power Ppump and laser efficiency.  Therefore: 

P+ = Pout  T = η Ppump  T 

(12.3.8) 

Thus  small  values  of  T  simply  result  in  higher  values  of  P+,  which  can  be  limited  by  internet 
breakdown or failure. 

One  approach  to  obtaining  extremely  high  laser  pulse  powers  is  to  abruptly  increase  the  Q 
(reverberation) of  the  laser  resonator after  the pump source has  fully populated  the upper energy 
level.  To prevent  lasing before  that  level  is fully populated, strong absorption can be  introduced 
in  the  round-trip  laser path  to prevent  amplification of  any  stimulated  emission.   The  instant  the 
absorption  ceases,  i.e.  after  Q-switching,  the  average  round-trip  gain  g  of  the  laser  per  meter 
exceeds  the  average  absorption α  and oscillation  commences.   At high Q values  lasing  action  is 
rapid  and  intense,  so  the  entire  upper  population  is  encouraged  to  emit  instantly,  particularly  if 
the lower level can be rapidly emptied.  Such a device is called a Q-switched laser.  Resonator Q 
is discussed further in Section 7.8. 

The electronic  states of glass  fiber amplifiers are usually associated with quantized electron 
orbits  around  the  added  Erbium  atoms,  and  state  transitions  simply  involve  electron  transfers 
between  two  atomic  orbits  having  different  energies.    In  contrast,  the  most  common  lasers  are 
laser  diodes,  which  are  transparent  semiconductor  p-n  junctions  for  which  the  electron  energy 
transitions occur between the conduction and valence bands, as suggested in Figure 12.3.6.

Figure 12.3.6  Laser diode – a forward-biased p-n junction  
 
bounded by mirrors promoting oscillation. 

Parallel  mirrors  at  the  sides  of  the  p-n  junction  partially  trap  the  laser  energy,  forming  an 
oscillator  that  radiates  perpendicular  to  the  mirrors;  one  of  the  mirrors  is  semi-transparent. 
Strong  emission  does  not  occur  in  any  other  direction  because  without  the  mirrors  there  is  no 
feedback.  Such  lasers  are  pumped  by  forward-biasing  the  diode  so  that  electrons  thermally 
excited  into  the  n-type  conduction  band  diffuse  into  the  active  region  where  photons  can 
stimulate emission, yielding amplification and oscillation within  the ~0.2-μm  thick p-n  junction. 
Vacancies  in  the  valence  band  are  provided  by  the holes  that  diffuse  into  the  active  region  from 
the  p-type  region.  Voltage-modulated  laser  diodes  can  produce  digital  pulse  streams  at  rates 
above 100 Mbps. 

The vertical axis E of Figure 12.3.6(a) is electron energy and the horizontal axis is position z 
 
through the diode from the p to n sides of the junction.   The exponentials suggest the Boltzmann 
energy distributions of the holes and electrons in the valence and conduction bands, respectively. 
Below  the Fermi  level, EF, energy states have a high probability of being occupied by electrons; 
EF(z)  tilts  up  toward  the  right  because  of  the  voltage  drop  from  the  p-side  to  the  n-side.    Figure 
12.3.6(b)  plots  electron  energy  E  versus  the  magnitude  of  the  k  vector  for  electrons  (quantum 
approaches  treat  electrons  as  waves  characterized  by  their  wavenumber  k),  and  suggests  why 
diode  lasers  can  have  broad  bandwidths:  the  energy  band  curvature  with  k  broadens  the  laser 
linewidth  Δf.  Incoming  photons  can  stimulate  any  electron  in  the  conduction  band  to  decay  to 
any  empty  level  (hole)  in  the  valence  band,  and  both  of  these  bands  have  significant  energy 
spreads ΔE, where the linewidth Δf ≅ ΔE/h [Hz]. 

The  resonant  frequencies  of  laser  diode  oscillators  are  determined  by E2  - E1,  the  linewidth 
of that transition, and by the resonant frequencies of the TEM mirror cavity resonator.  The width 
Δω  of  each  resonance  is  discussed  further  later.    If  the mirrors  are  perfect  conductors  that  force 
E //  = 0 ,  then  there must be an  integral number m of half wavelengths within  the cavity  length L 
so that mλm = 2L.  The wavelength λm' is typically shorter than the free-space wavelength λm due 
to the index of refraction n of the laser material.  Therefore λm = 2Ln/m = c/fm, and: 

fm  = cm

For typical laser diodes L and n might be 0.5 mm and 3, respectively, yielding a spacing between 
cavity  resonances  of:  c/2Ln  =  3×108/(2×10-3×1.5)  =  100  GHz,  as  suggested  in  Figure  12.3.7(a). 
The  figure  suggests  how  the  natural  (atomic)  laser  line  width  might  accommodate  multiple 
cavity resonances, or possibly only one.

If  the  amplifier  line  shape  is  narrow  compared  to  the  spacing  between  cavity  resonances, 
then  the  cavity  length L might  require  adjustment  in  order  to  place  one  of  the  cavity  resonances 
on  the  line  center  before  oscillations  occur.  The  line width  of  a  laser  depends  on  the widths  of 
the associated energy levels Ei and Ej.  These can be quite broad, as suggested by the laser diode 
energy  bands  illustrated  in  Figure  12.3.6(b),  or  quite  narrow.    Similarly,  the  atoms  in  an  EDFA 
are each subject  to slightly different  local electrical fields due  to  the random nature of  the glassy 
structure  in which  they are  imbedded.   This  results  in each atom having  slightly different values 
for  Ei  so  that  EFDA’s  amplify  over  bandwidths  much  larger  than  the  bandwidth  of  any  single 
atom. 

Lasers  for  which  each  atom  has  its  own  slightly  displaced  resonant  frequency  due  to  local 
fields are said  to exhibit  inhomogeneous  line broadening.  In contrast, many  lasers have no such 
frequency  spread  induced  by  local  factors,  so  that  all  excited  atoms  exhibit  the  same  line  center 
and  width;  these  are  said  to  exhibit  homogeneous  line  broadening.  The  significance  of  this 
difference  is  that  when  laser  amplifiers  are  saturated  and  operate  in  their  linear  growth  region, 
homogeneously  broadened  lasers  permit  the  strongest  cavity  resonance  within  the  natural  line 
width  to  capture  most  of  the  energy  available  from  the  laser  pump,  suppressing  the  rest  of  the 
emission  and  narrowing  the  line,  as  suggested  in  Figure  12.3.7(b).    This  suppression  of  weak 
resonances  is  reduced  in  inhomogeneously  broadened  lasers  because  all  atoms  are  pumped 
equally  and  have  their  own  frequency  sub-bands  where  they  amplify  independently  within  the 
natural line width. 

In  gases  the  width  of  any  spectral  line  is  also  controlled  by  the  frequency  of  molecular 
collisions.  Figure  12.3.8(b)  illustrates  how  an  atom  or molecule with  sinusoidal  time  variations 
in  its  dipole  moment  might  be  interrupted  by  collisions  that  randomly  reset  the  phase.    An 
electromagnetic wave interacting with this atom or molecule would then see a less pure sinusoid. 
This new spectral characteristic would no longer be a spectral impulse, i.e., the Fourier transform 
of  a  pure  sinusoid,  but  rather  the  transform  of  a  randomly  interrupted  sinusoid,  which  has  the 
Lorentz  line  shape  illustrated  in  Figure  12.3.8(a).    Its  half-power  width  is  Δf,  which  is 
approximately  the  collision  frequency  divided  by  2π.  The  limited  lifetime  of  an  atom  or 

- 388 -


molecule  in  any  state  due  to  the  probability  A  of  spontaneous  emission  results  in  similar 
broadening, where Δf ≅ A/2π; this is called the intrinsic linewidth of that transition.

Example 12.3B 
A Q-switched 1-micron wavelength laser of length L = 1 mm is doped with 1018 active atoms all 
pumped  to  their  upper  state.   When  the  Q  switches  instantly  to  100,  approximately  what  is  the 
maximum laser power output P [W]?  Assume ε = 4εo. 

Solution:  The total energy released when the Q switches is 1018hf ≅ 1018 × 6.6×10-34  × 3×1014 = 
0.20 Joules.  If  the  laser gain  is sufficiently high,  then a  triggering photon originating 
near  the  output  could  be  fully  amplified  by  the  time  the  beam  reaches  the  rear  of  the 
laser, so that all atoms would be excited as that reflected pulse emerges from the front 
of  the  laser.  A  triggering  photon  at  the  rear  of  the  laser  would  leave  some  atoms 
unexcited.  Thus  the minimum  time  for  full  energy  release  lies  between  one  and  two 
transit  times τ of  the  laser, depending on  its gain; τ = L/c' = 2L/c = 6.7×10-12.  Lower 
laser  gains  may  require  many  transit  times  before  all  atoms  are  stimulated  to  emit. 
Therefore P < ~0.2/(6.7×10-12) ≅ 30 GW. 

12.4  Optical detectors, multiplexers, interferometers, and switches 

12.4.1  Phototubes 

Sensitive  radio-frequency  detectors  typically  require  at  least  10-20  Joules  per  bit  of  information, 
which  roughly  corresponds  to  thousands  of  photons  of  energy  hf,  where  Planck’s  constant  h  = 
6.625×10-34  Joules  Hz-1.  This  number  of  photons  is  sufficiently  high  that  we  can  ignore  most 
quantum  effects  and  treat  the  arriving  radio  signals  as  traditional  waves.    In  contrast,  many 
optical detectors can detect single photons, although more than five photons are typically used to 
distinguish each pulse from interference; this requires more energy per bit than is needed at radio 
wavelengths.  The  advantage of  long-range optical  links  lies  instead  in  the  extremely  low  losses 
of  optical  fibers  or,  alternatively,  in  the  ability of  relatively  small mirrors  or  telescopes  to  focus 

- 389 -


energy  in  extremely  small  beams  so  as  to  achieve  much  higher  gains  than  can  practical  radio 
antennas. 

Typical  photon  detectors  include  phototubes  and  semiconductors.    A  phototube  detects 
photons having energies hf > Φ using the photoelectric effect, where Φ is the work function [J] of 
the  metal  surface  (cathode)  that  intercepts  the  photons.    Photons  with  energies  above  this 
threshold  eject  an  electron  from  the  cathode  with  typical  probabilities  η  (called  the  quantum 
efficiency)  of  ~10-30  percent.    These  ejected  electrons  are  then  pulled  in  vacuum  toward  a 
positively charged anode and contribute to the current I through the load resistor R, as illustrated 
in Figure 12.4.1(a).  Although early phototubes ejected electrons from  the  illuminated surface,  it 
is now common for the metal to be sufficiently thin and transparent that the electrons are emitted 
from  the  backside  of  the  metal  into  vacuum;  the  metal  is  evaporated  in  a  thin  layer  onto  the 
interior surface of the tube’s evacuated glass envelope.

(12.4.1) 

The work functions of most metals are ~2-6 electron volts, where the energy of one electron volt 
(e.v.)  is  –eV  =  1.602×10-19  Joules72.  Therefore  phototubes  do  not  work  well  for  infrared  or 
longer  wavelengths  because  their  energy  hf  is  too  small;  2  e.v.  corresponds  to  a  wavelength  of 
0.62 microns and the color red. 

Because  the  charge  on  an  electron  is  small,  the  currents  I  are  often  too  small  to  induce 
voltages  across  R  (see  Figure  12.4.1)  that  exceed  the  thermal  noise  (Johnson  noise)  of  the 
resistor unless the illumination is bright.  Photomultiplier tubes release perhaps 104 electrons per 
detected  photon  so  as  to  overcome  this  noise  and  permit  each  detected  photon  to  be 
unambiguously  counted.    The  structure  of  a  typical  photomultiplier  tube  is  illustrated  in  Figure 
12.4.1(b).  Each  photoelectron  emitted  by  the  cathode  is  accelerated  toward  the  first  dynode  at 
~50-100  volts,  and  gains  energy  sufficient  to  eject  perhaps  five  or  more  low  energy  electrons 
from the dynode that are then accelerated toward the second dynode to be multiplied again.  The

illustrated  tube  has  four  dynodes  that,  when  appropriately  charged,  each  multiply  the  incident 
electrons  by  ~5  to  yield  ~54  ≅  625  electrons  at  the  output  for  each  photon  detected  at  the  input. 
Typical  tubes  have  more  dynodes  and  gains  of  ~104-107.  Such  large  current  pulses  generally 
overwhelm  the  thermal  noise  in  R,  so  random  electron  emissions  induced  by  cosmic  rays  or 
thermal  effects  at  the  cathode  dominate  the  detector  noise.    The  collecting  areas  of  such  tubes 
can be enhanced with lenses or mirrors. 

12.4.2  Photodiodes 

Phototubes  are  generally  large  (several  cubic  inches),  expensive,  and  fragile,  and  therefore 
semiconductor photodiodes are more commonly used.  Photodiodes also respond better to visible 
and  infrared  wavelengths  and  operate  at  much  lower  voltages.    Figure  12.4.2(a)  illustrates  the 
energy  diagram  for  a  typical  short-circuited  p-n  junction  between  p-type  and  n-type 
semiconductors, where  the vertical axis  is electron energy E and  the horizontal axis  is distance z 
perpendicular to the planar junction.

The  lower  cross-hatched  area  is  the  valence  band  within  which  electrons  are  lightly  bound  to 
ions,  and  the  upper  area  is  the  conduction  band  within  which  electrons  are  free  to  move  in 
response  to electric  fields.   The band gap between  these  regions  is ~1.12 electron volts  (e.v.)  for 
silicon,  and  ranges  from  0.16  e.v.  for  InSb  (indium  antimonide  to  ~7.5  e.v.  for  BN  (boron 
nitride).  In metals there is no such gap and some electrons always reside in the conduction band 
and are mobile.  Additional discussion of p-n junctions appears in Section 8.2.4. 

Electrons  move  freely  in  the  conduction  band,  but  not  if  they  remain  in  the  valence  band. 
Most  photons  entering  the  junction  region  with  energy  greater  than  the  bandgap  between  the 
Fermi  level  and  the  lower  edge  of  the  conduction  band  can  excite  electrons  into  the  conduction 

- 391 -


band  to  enhance  device  conductivity.    In  semiconductors  the  Fermi  level  is  that  level 
corresponding  to  the  nominal  maximum  energy  of  electrons  available  for  excitation  into  the 
conduction  band.    The  local  Fermi  level  is  determined  by  impurities  in  the  semiconductors  that 
create  electron  donor  or  acceptor  sites;  these  sites  easily  release  or  capture,  respectively,  a  free 
electron.  The Fermi level sits just below the conduction band for n-type semiconductors because 
donor atoms easily release one of their electrons into the conduction band, as illustrated in Figure 
12.4.2(a)  and  (b).  The  Fermi  level  sits  just  above  the  valence  band  for  p-type  semiconductors 
because acceptor atoms easily capture an extra electron from bound states in nearby atoms. 

If  the  p-n  junction  is  short-circuited  externally,  the  Fermi  level  is  the  same  on  both  halves, 
as  shown  in  Figure  12.4.2(a).  Random  thermal  excitation  produces  an  exponential  Boltzmann 
distribution  in  electron  energy,  as  suggested  in  the  figure,  the  upper  tails  of  which  lie  in  the 
conduction band on both halves of the junction.  When the device is short-circuited these current 
flows  from  thermal  excitations  in  the  p  and  n  halves  of  the  junction  balance,  and  the  external 
If,  however,  the  diode  is  back-biased  by  VB  volts  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
current  is  zero. 
12.4.2(b),  then  the  two  exponential  tails  do  not  balance  and  a  net  back-current  current  flows,  as 
suggested  by  the  I-V  characteristic  for  a  p-n  junction  illustrated  in  Figure  12.4.2(c).    The  back 
current  for  an  un-illuminated  photodiode  approaches  an  asymptote  determined  by  VB  and  the 
number  of  thermal  electrons  excited  per  second  into  the  conduction  band  for  the  p-type 
semiconductor.    When  an  un-illuminated  junction  is  forward  biased,  the  current  increases 
roughly exponentially. 

When  a  p-n  junction  is  operated  as  a  photodiode,  it  is  back-biased  so  that  every  detected 
photon  contributes  current  flow  to  the  circuit,  nearly  one  electron  per  photon  received.    By 
cooling the photodiode the thermal contribution to diode current can be reduced markedly so that 
the diode becomes more sensitive to dim light.  Cooling is particularly important for photodiodes 
with  the  small  bandgaps  needed  for  detecting  infrared  radiation;  otherwise  the  detected  infrared 
signals must be bright so they exceed the detector noise. 

If photodiodes are sufficiently back-biased, they can enter the avalanche region illustrated in 
Figure  12.4.2(c),  where  an  excited  electron  is  accelerated  sufficiently  as  it  moves  through  the 
semiconductor  that  it  can  impact  and  excite  another  electron  into  the  conduction  band;  both 
electrons can now accelerate and excite even more electrons, exponentially, until they all exit the 
high-field  zone  so  that  further  excitations  are  not  possible.    In  response  to  a  single  detected 
photon  such  avalanche photodiodes  (APD’s)  can  produce  an  output  pulse  of ~104  electrons  that 
stands  out  sufficiently  above  the  thermal  noise  that  photons  can  again  be  counted  individually. 
The  number  of  photons  detected  per  second  is  proportional  to  input  power,  and  therefore  to  the 
square of the incident electric field strength. 

12.4.3  Frequency-multiplexing devices and filters 

The major  components  in  fiber-optic  communications  systems  are  the  fibers  themselves  and  the 
optoelectronic  devices  that  manipulate  the  optical  signals,  such  as  detectors  (discussed  in 
Sections  12.4.1–2),  amplifiers  and  sources  (Section  12.3), multiplexers  and  filters  (this  section),

A  typical  wave-division  multiplexed  (WDM)  amplifier  is  pictured  in  Figure  12.4.3; 
narrowband optical  signals of different colors are aggregated at a point of departure and merged 
onto  a  single  long  fiber  by  a  frequency  multiplexer  (MUX).    Along  this  fiber  extremely 
broadband  optical  amplifiers  (OAMPs)  are  spaced  perhaps  80  km  apart  to  sustain  the  signal 
strength.  OAMPs  today  are  typically  erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers  (EFDA’s).    At  the  far  end 
the  signal  is  de-multiplexed  into  its  spectral  components,  which  are  then  directed  appropriately 
along separate optical fibers.  Before broadband amplifiers were available, each narrow band had 
to have separate amplifiers and often separate fibers.

Such  multiplexers  can  be  made  using  prisms  or  diffraction  gratings  that  refract  or  diffract 
different  colors  at  different  angles,  as  suggested  in  Figure  12.4.4(a)  and  (b);  by  reciprocity  the 
same  devices  can  be  used  either  for  multiplexing  (superimposing  multiple  frequency  bands  on 
one  beam)  or  demultiplexing  (separation  of  a  single  beam  into  multiple  bands),  depending  on 
which end of the device receives the input. 

The  diffraction  grating  of  Figure  12.4.4(b)  is  typically  illuminated  by  normally  incident 
uniform  plane  waves,  and  consists  of  closely  spaced  ruled  straight  lines  where  equal-width 
stripes  typically  alternate  between  transmission  and  reflection  or  absorption.    Alternate  stripes 
sometimes  differ  only  in  their  phase.    Each  stripe  must  be  more  than  λ/2  wide,  and  λ  is  more 
typical.  In  this  case  the  rays  from  each  transparent  stripe  2λ  apart  will  add  in  phase  straight 
forward  (θ  =  0)  and  at  θ  =  sin-1(λ/2λ)  =  30o,  exactly  analogous  to  the  grating  lobes  of  dipole 
array antennas (Section 10.4).  Since the stripe separation (2λ here) is fixed, as the frequency f = 
c/λ varies, so does θ,  thus directing different frequencies  toward different angles of propagation, 
much like the prism. 

Another  useful  optical  device  is  the  Fabry-Perot  resonator,  which  is  the  optical  version  of 
the TEM resonator illustrated in Figure 7.4.3(a) and explained in Section 7.4.3.  For example, an 
optical TEM resonator can be fabricated using parallel mirrors with uniform plane waves trapped 
between them; the allowed resonator modes have an integral number n of half-wavelengths in the 
distance L between the parallel conductors: 

nλ n 2 = L

Thus the frequency fn of the nth TEM resonance is:

and  the separation between adjacent  resonances  is c/2L  [Hz].   For example,  if L  is 1.5 mm,  then 
the resonances are separated 3×108/0.003 = 100 GHz. 

If  the  input  and  output mirrors  transmit  the  same  small  fraction  of  the  power  incident  upon 
them,  then  the “internal” and external Q’s of  this  resonator are  the  same, where  the “internal Q” 
here  (QI)  is associated with power escaping  through  the output mirror and  the “external Q”  (QE) 
is  associated  with  power  escaping  through  the  input  mirror.    As  suggested  by  the  equivalent 
circuits in Figures 7.4.4–5, there is perfect power transmission through the resonator at resonance 
when  the  internal  and  external Q’s  are  the  same,  provided  there  are  no  dissipative  losses within 
the resonator itself.  The width of the resonance is then found from (7.4.45–6): 

Δω = ω o  QL  = 2ωo  QE  = 2P
 
E  w T 

(12.4.4)

The loaded QL = QE/2 when QE = QI, and PE [W]  is  the power escaping  through  the input mirror 
when  the  total  energy  stored  in  the  resonator  is  wT  [J].   With  high  reflectivity  mirrors  and  low 
residual  losses  the  bandwidth  of  such  a  resonator  can  be  made  almost  arbitrarily  narrow.    At 
optical frequencies the ratio of cavity length L to wavelength λ is also very large.  This increases 
the ratio of wT to PE proportionally and leads to very high QL and narrow linewidth. 

If  the  medium  in  a  Fabry-Perot  interferometer  is  dispersive,  then  it  can  be  shown  that  the 
spacing  between  resonances  is  vg/2L  [Hz],  or  the  reciprocal  of  the  round-trip  time  for  a  pulse. 
Thus such a resonator filled with an active medium could amplify a single pulse that rattles back 
and  forth  in  the  resonator  producing  sharp  output  pulses  with  a  period  2L/vg.  The  Fourier 
transform  of  this  pulse  train  is  a  train  of  impulses  in  the  frequency  domain  with  spacing  vg/2L, 
i.e., representing the set of resonant frequencies for this resonator. The resonant modes of such a 
mode-locked  laser  are  synchronized,  so  they  can  usefully  generate  pulse  trains  for  subsequent 
modulation. 

Example 12.4A 
What  is  the  ratio  of  the  width  Δω  of  the  passband  for  a  Fabry-Perot  resonator  relative  to  the

T2 =  |Et|2/|E 2
i|   is required for each mirror  in order  to produce  isolated sharp resonances?   What  is 
the width Δf [Hz] of each resonance? 

Solution:  The resonance width Δω and spacing are given by (12.4.4) and (12.4.2), respectively, 
so:

12.4.4  Interferometers 

The  Michelson  interferometer  and  the  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  are  important  devices 
illustrated  in  Figure  12.4.4(c)  and  (d),  respectively.    In  both  cases  an  input  optical  beam  is  split 
by  a  beam-splitter  into  two  coherent  beams  that  are  reflected  by  mirrors  and  then  recombined 
coherently  in  a  second  beam-splitter  to  form  two  output  beams.    The  intensity  of  each  output 
beam depends on whether  its  two  input components added  in-phase or out-of-phase.   The beam-
splitters  are  typically  dielectric  mirrors  coated  so  that  half  the  power  is  reflected  and  half 
transmitted from the front surface; the rear surface might be anti-reflection coated.  Half-silvered 
mirrors can also be used. 

As  the  position  x  of  a  Michelson  mirror  varies,  the  output  power  varies  sinusoidally  from 
zero,  which  results  when  the  two  beams  cancel  at  the  output,  to  its  peak  value  when  the  two 
beams  add  in  phase.    Cancellation  requires  that  the  two  beams  have  equal  strength.    It  is 
interesting  to  ask  where  the  input  power  goes  when  output  “A”  is  zero;  the  figure  suggests  the 
answer.  The  missing  power  emerges  from  the  other  output;  the  sum  of  the  powers  emerging 

- 395 -




from  the  two  outputs  equals  the  input  power,  less  any  dissipative  losses.    This  requirement  for 
power  conservation  translates  into  a  requirement  for  a  specific  phase  relationship  between  the 
various beams. 

Consecutive  peaks  in  output  strength  occur  as  the  mirror  moves  λ/2  (typically  ~3×10-7  m); 
the  factor  of  1/2  arises  because  of  the  round  trip  taken  by  the  reflected  beam.    The  sinusoidal 
output  power  can  generally  be  measured  with  sufficient  accuracy  at  optical  wavelengths  to 
determine  relative mirror  positions  x with  accuracies  of  an  angstrom  (10-10 m),  or  tiny  fractions 
thereof;  thus  the  Michelson  interferometer  is  a  powerful  tool  for  measuring  or  comparing 
wavelengths  and  distances.  Another  important  application  is  measurement  of  optical  spectra. 
Since  each  optical wavelength  λ  in  the  input  beam  produces  an  additive  sinusoidal  contribution 
to the output power waveform A(x) of period λ/2, the input optical power spectrum is the Fourier 
transform of A(2x).  Because this technique was first used to analyze infrared spectra, it is called 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 

If the two output beams in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer add in phase, the output power is 
maximized  and  equals  the  input  power, much  like  the Michelson  interferometer.    In  either  type 
of  interferometer  the  phase  of  the  optical  beam  in  one  arm  can  be  modulated  by  varying  the 
effective  dielectric  constant  and  delay  of  its  propagation medium;  certain  dielectrics  are  tunable 
when  biased with  large  electric  fields.    In  this  fashion  the  output  beam  power  can  be modulated 
by  varying  the  voltage  V  across  the  propagation  medium,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  12.4.4(d)  and 
(e).  If  the  device  operates  near  a  transmission  null,  very  little  change  in  refractive  index  is 
required  to produce  a  large  increase  in  output  power.   Such  devices  can modulate  optical  power 
at frequencies of 10 GHz or more. 

The  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  configuration  in  Figure  12.4.4(e)  is  widely  used  for 
modulators  because  the  waveguides  can  be  integrated  on  a  chip  together  with  other  optical 
components.    The  output  is  maximum  when  the  two  arms  have  equal  phase  delays.   When  the 
two  merging  beams  are  out  of  phase  the  excited  waveguide  mode  is  not  trapped  in  the  output 
waveguide  but  radiates  away;  the  radiated  wave  corresponds  to  output  B  in  Figure  12.4.4(d). 
The  same  integrated  configuration  can  alternatively  be  used  as  a  notch  filter,  eliminating  an 
undesired optical wavelength  for which  the  two arm  lengths differ by exactly λ/2, while passing 
nearby wavelengths. 

12.4.5  Optical switches 

Optical  switches  redirect  optical  beams  just  as  electrical  switches  redirect  currents.    One 
approach is to use MEMS devices that mechanically move mirrors or shutters to redirect the light 
beams,  which  usually  are  narrow,  coherent,  and  laser-produced.    Such  devices  can  switch  light 
beams at rates approaching 1 MHz. 

Another  approach  is  to  direct  the  light  beam  at  right  angles  to  a  dielectric  within  which 
ultrasonic  acoustic  waves  (at  radio  frequencies)  are  propagating  transverse  to  the  light  so  as  to 
produce  a  dynamic  phase  grating  through  which  the  light  propagates  and  diffracts.    The 
configuration  is  that  of  Figure  12.4.4(b).  The  acoustic  waves  compress  and  decompress  the 
medium  in  a  wavy  pattern;  the  compressed  regions  have  a  slightly  higher  permittivity  and 

- 396 -


therefore  a  slightly  lower  velocity  of  light.    By  making  the  dielectric  sufficiently  thick,  the 
cumulative  phase  variation  of  the  light  passing  through  the  device  can  be  λ/2  or  more,  thus 
producing  strong  diffraction  at  an  angle  θ  corresponding  to  the  wavelength  of  light  λ  and  the 
acoustic  wavelength  λa,  where  θ  =  sin-1(λ/λa)  and  λa  ≅  2λ.  In  practice  the  cumulative  phase 
variation  is  often  much  less  than  λ/2  because  of  improved  simplicity,  linearity,  and  the 
availability  of  high  input  powers  that  can  compensate  for  the  reduced  diffractive  power 
efficiency.  In this fashion the diffracted beam can be steered among several output ports at rates 
up  to  ~1  MHz  or  more,  limited  largely  by  the  time  it  takes  the  acoustic  wave  to  traverse  the 
diffraction zone.  Acoustic velocities in solids are roughly 1000-3000 m/s. 

A  more  important  method,  however,  is  the  use  of  Mach-Zehnder  interferometers  (see 
Section  12.4.4)  to modulate  input  optical  streams,  varying  their  intensity  by more  than  15  dB  at 
rates  up  to  ~10  GHz,  limited  by  the  time  it  takes  the  signals  modulating  the  electrical  phase 
length modulator of Figure 12.4.4(e) to propagate across that modulator (e.g. nanoseconds).  The 
detected  modulator  output  signal  is  the  product  of  the  optical  and  modulator  signals.    The 
spectrum of  this product contains  the convolution of  the  two  input spectra, which exhibits upper 
and lower sidebands that correspond to the radio frequency signal being communicated.
