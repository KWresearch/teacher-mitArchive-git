2.1  Maxwell’s differential equations in the time domain 

Whereas  the  Lorentz  force  law  characterizes  the  observable  effects  of  electric  and  magnetic 
fields  on  charges,  Maxwell’s  equations  characterize  the  origins  of  those  fields  and  their 
relationships to each other.  The simplest representation of Maxwell’s equations is in differential 
form, which leads directly to waves; the alternate integral form is presented in Section 2.4.3. 

The differential form uses the vector del operator ∇: 

∂ 
∇ ≡ xˆ 
∂x 

+ yˆ 

∂ 
∂ 
+ zˆ 
∂y 
∂z 

(2.1.1)
 

where  xˆ ,  yˆ  ,  and  zˆ   are  defined  as  unit  vectors  in  cartesian  coordinates.    Relations  involving ∇ 
are  summarized  in  Appendix  D.    Here  we  use  the  conventional  vector  dot  product1  and  cross 
product2 of ∇ with the electric and magnetic field vectors where, for example: 

E = xˆE x  + yˆE y  + zˆE z 

∇ • E ≡

(2.1.3)
 

We  call  ∇ • E   the  divergence  of  E   because  it  is  a  measure  of  the  degree  to  which  the  vector 
field⎯E diverges or flows outward from any position.  The cross product is defined as:

which  is  often  called  the  curl  of  E .    Figure  2.1.1  illustrates  when  the  divergence  and  curl  are 
zero or non-zero for five representative field distributions.

These  four  Maxwell  equations  invoke  one  scalar  and  five  vector  quantities  comprising  16 
variables.    Some variables only  characterize how matter  alters  field behavior,  as discussed  later 
 
in Section 2.5.  In vacuum we can eliminate three vectors (9 variables) by noting:

where εo = 8.8542×10-12  [farads m-1]  is  the permittivity of vacuum, μo = 4π×10-7  [henries m-1]  is 
the  permeability  of  vacuum3,  v   is  the  velocity  of  the  local  net  charge  density  ρ,  and  σ  is  the 
conductivity  of  a  medium  [Siemens  m-1].  If  we  regard  the  electrical  sources  ρ  and  J   as  given, 
then  the  equations  can  be  solved  for  all  remaining  unknowns.   Specifically, we  can  then  find  E 
and  H ,  and  thus  compute  the  forces  on  all  charges  present.    Except  for  special  cases  we  shall 
avoid  solving  problems  where  the  electromagnetic  fields  and  the  motions  of  ρ  are 
interdependent. 

The  constitutive  relations  for  vacuum,  D = ε0 E  and  B = μ0 H ,  can  be  generalized  to 
D = εE ,  B = μH , and  J = σE  for simple media.  Media are discussed further in Section 2.5. 

Maxwell’s equations require conservation of charge.  By taking the divergence of Ampere’s 
law (2.1.6) and noting the vector identity  ∇ • ∇(  × A  ) = 0 , we find:

∂D 
∇ •  ∇ × H  ) = 0 = ∇ • 
( 
+ ∇ • J 
∂t 

(2.1.18)

Then,  by  reversing  the  sequence  of  the  derivatives  in  (2.1.18)  and  substituting  Gauss’s  law 
∇ • D = ρ  (2.1.7), we obtain the differential expression for conservation of charge: 

∂ρ 
∇ • J = − 
∂t 

(conservation of charge) 

(2.1.19)

The  integral  expression  can  be  derived  from  the  differential  expression  by  using  Gauss’s 
divergence  theorem,  which  relates  the  integral  of  ∇ • G over  any  volume  V  to  the  integral  of 
G • nˆ   over  the  surface  area  A  of  that  volume,  where  the  surface  normal  unit  vector  nˆ   points

Electromagnetic waves in the time domain 

Perhaps  the greatest  triumph of Maxwell’s equations was  their ability  to predict  in a simple way 
the existence and velocity of electromagnetic waves based on simple laboratory measurements of 
the  permittivity  and  permeability  of  vacuum.    In  vacuum  the  charge  density  ρ  =⎯J  =  0,  and  so 
Maxwell’s equations become:

(2.2.4) 

We  can  eliminate  H   from  these  equations  by  computing  the  curl  of  Faraday’s  law,  which 
introduces  ∇ × H  on its right-hand side so Ampere’s law can be substituted:

(2.2.6) 

and  then  using  (2.2.3)  to  eliminate  ∇ • E ,  (2.2.5)  becomes  the  electromagnetic  wave  equation, 
often called the Helmholtz wave equation:

(2.2.8) 

The  solutions  to  this  wave  equation  (2.2.7)  are  any  fields  E ( r , t )   for  which  the  second 
spatial  derivative  (∇ 2 E )   equals  a  constant  times  the  second  time  derivative  (  2  ∂ 2   ) .  The 
∂  E t
position  vector  r ≡ xˆx + yˆy + zˆz .  The  wave  equation  is  therefore  satisfied  by  any  arbitrary 
E ( r , t )   having  identical  dependence  on  space  and  time  within  a  constant  multiplier.    For 
example, arbitrary functions of  the arguments (z - ct), (z + ct), or (t ± z/c) have such an  identical 
dependence  and  are  among  the  valid  solutions  to  (2.2.7),  where  c  is  some  constant  to  be 
determined.  One such solution is: 

E ( r, t  ) = E ( z − ct  ) = x ˆE  ( 
)
x z − ct  

(2.2.9)
 

where  the  arbitrary  function  Ex(z  -  ct) might  be  that  illustrated  in  Figure  2.2.1  at  time  t  =  0  and 
again  at  some  later  time  t.    Note  that  as  time  advances  within  the  argument  (z  -  ct),  z  must 
advance  with  ct  in  order  for  that  argument,  or⎯E  at  any  point  of  interest  on  the  waveform,  to 
remain constant.

We  can  test  this  candidate  solution  (2.2.9)  by  substituting  it  into  the wave  equation  (2.2.7),

(2.2.10) 

where we define  A '(q)  as  the  first derivative of  A  with  respect  to  its argument q and  A ''(q )  as 
its second derivative.  Equation (2.2.10) is satisfied if: 

c = 

1 
    [m/s] 
(μ εo o  

where we define c as the velocity of light in vacuum: 

(2.2.11)

c = 2.998×108  [m s-1] 

(velocity of light) 

(2.2.12) 

Figure  2.2.1  illustrates  how  an  arbitrary  E(z, t )   can  propagate  by  translating  at  velocity  c. 
However, some caution is warranted when  E(z, t )  is defined.  Although our trial solution (2.2.9) 
satisfies  the  wave  equation  (2.2.7),  it  may  not  satisfy  Gauss’s  laws.    For  example,  consider  the 
case where: 

E ( z, t  ) = zˆEz ( z − ct  ) 

Then Gauss’s law  ∇ • E = 0  is not satisfied: 

∇ • E = Ez  ≠ 0  for arbitrary  E z( ) 
∂
∂z

(2.2.13)
 

(2.2.14) 

In contrast, if  E(z, t )  is oriented perpendicular to the direction of propagation (in the  xˆ  and/or  yˆ 
directions for z-directed propagation), then all Maxwell’s equations are satisfied and the solution 
is  valid.  In  the  case  E ( z,
 t  ) =  yˆE  ( z − ct  )
,  independent  of  x  and  y,  we  have  a  uniform  plane 
y 
wave  because  the  fields  are  uniform  with  respect  to  two  of  the  coordinates  (x,y)  so  that 
E x 
∂ ∂ = ∂  ∂ =  0 .  Since  this  electric  field  is  in  the  y  direction,  it  is  said  to  be  y-polarized;  by 
E y 
convention,  polarization  of  a  wave  refers  to  the  direction  of  its  electric  vector.    Polarization  is 
discussed further in Section 2.3.4. 

Knowing  E ( z, t  ) =  yˆ E (y z − ct  )   for  this  example,  we  can  now  find  H (z, t )   using  Faraday’s 
 
law (2.2.1):

Thus  E   and  H   in  a  uniform  plane  wave  are  very  simply  related.    Their  directions  are

plane wave in free space, 

E H  = ηo  =  μ o /εo  ≅ 377   [ohms] 

(2.2.19)
 

Electromagnetic waves can propagate  in any arbitrary direction  in  space with arbitrary  time 
behavior.  That  is,  we  are  free  to  define  xˆ ,  yˆ  ,  and  zˆ   in  this  example  as  being  in  any  three 
orthogonal  directions  in  space.    Because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear  in  field  strength, 
superposition  applies  and  any  number  of  plane  waves  propagating  in  arbitrary  directions  with 
arbitrary  polarizations  can  be  superimposed  to  yield  valid  electromagnetic  solutions.    Exactly 
which  superposition  is  the  valid  solution  in  any  particular  case  depends  on  the  boundary 
conditions and  the  initial conditions for  that case, as discussed  later  in Chapter 9  for a variety of 
geometries.

2.3.1 

Sinusoidal waves 

Linear systems are easily characterized by  the magnitude and phase of each output as a  function 
of  the  frequency  at  which  the  input  is  sinusoidally  stimulated.    This  simple  characterization  is 
sufficient  because  sinusoids  of  different  frequencies  can  be  superimposed  to  construct  any 
arbitrary  input waveform5, and  the output of a  linear  system  is  the  superposition of  its  responses 
to  each  superimposed  input.    Systems  with  multiple  inputs  and  outputs  can  be  characterized  in 
the  same  way.  Nonlinear  systems  are  more  difficult  to  characterize  because  their  output 
frequencies generally include harmonics of their inputs. 

Fortunately  free  space  is  a  linear  system,  and  therefore  it  is  fully  characterized  by  its 
response  to  sinusoidal  plane  waves.  For  example,  the  arbitrary  z-propagating  x-polarized 
uniform plane wave of (2.2.9) and Figure 2.2.1 could be sinusoidal and represented by: 
E r( , t  ) = xˆE  o cos  ⎡ k ( z −

⎤

(2.3.2)

where  the  wave  amplitude  Eo  is  a  constant  and  the  factor  k  is  related  to  frequency,  as  shown 
below. 

It  is more  common  to  represent  sinusoidal waves  using  the  argument  (ωt  -  kz)  so  that  their 
frequency and spatial dependences are more evident.   The angular  frequency ω  is simply related 
to frequency f [Hz]: 

ω = 2πf  [radians s-1] 

(angular frequency) 

(2.3.3)
 

4 Q.E.D. is the abbreviation for the Latin phrase “quod erat demonstratum” or “that which was to be demonstrated.” 
5 The Fourier transform pair (10.4.17) and (10.4.18) relate arbitrary pulse waveforms h(t) to their corresponding 
spectra H(f), where each frequency f has its own magnitude and phase represented by H(f). 

- 30 -


and  the spatial  frequency k, often called  the wavenumber,  is simply related  to ω and wavelength 
λ [m], which is the length of one period in space: 

k = 2π/λ = ω/c  [radians m-1] 

(wave number) 

(2.3.4)
 

The  significance  and  dimensions  of  ω  and  k  are  directly  analogous;  they  are  radians  s-1  and 
radians m-1, respectively. 

Therefore we can alternatively represent the wave of (2.3.1) and (2.3.2) as: 

E ( r, t  ) = xˆ Eo cos  ( ωt − kz  )  ⎣⎡ v m  -1 
⎦⎤ 

H ( z, t  ) =  yˆ  ε  /μ  E cos  ( ωt − kz  ) ⎡⎣A m  -1 ⎤⎦

(2.3.6)

Figure  2.3.1  suggests  the  form  of  this  wave.    Its  wavelength  is  λ,  the  length  of  one  cycle, 
where: 

λ = c/f  [m] 

(wavelength) 

(2.3.7) 

The  figure  illustrates  how  these  electric  and magnetic  fields  are  in  phase  but  orthogonal  to  each 
other  and  to  the  direction  of  propagation.   When  the  argument  (ωt  –  kz)  equals  zero,  the  fields 
are maximum, consistent with cos(ωt - kz).

2.3.2  Maxwell’s equations in the complex-frequency domain 

Electromagnetic  fields  are  commonly  characterized  in  the  frequency  domain  in  terms  of  their 
magnitudes  and  phases  as  a  function  of  position  r   for  frequency  f.    For  example,  the  xˆ

We  can  use  such  phasors  to  simplify  Maxwell’s  equations.    For  example,  we  can  express

The  other  Maxwell  equations  can  be  similarly  transformed,  which  suggests  that  the  notation

e {[ ] e j

R
notation  from  (2.3.15)  results  in:  ∇ × E = − j ωB   .  Any  problem  solution  expressed  as  a  phasor, 
e.g.  E ( )r  ,  can  be  converted  back  into  a  time-domain  expression  by  the  operator  R {[ ]  ω

These  omissions  of  the  understood  notation  result  in  the  complex  or  time-harmonic  Maxwell

replaced the operator ∂/∂t with jω and placed an underbar under all variables, signifying that they 
are now phasors. 

We  can  immediately  derive  the  time-harmonic  equation  for  conservation  of  charge  (2.1.19) 
by computing the divergence of (2.3.17), noting that  ∇ • ∇( × A  ) = 0  for any  A , and substituting

2.3.3 

Sinusoidal uniform plane waves 

We  can  readily  derive  from  Maxwell’s  equations  the  time-harmonic  Helmholtz  wave  equation 
for  vacuum  (2.2.7)  by  substituting  jω  for  ∂/∂t  or,  as  we  did  earlier,  by  taking  the  curl  of 
Faraday’s  law,  using  the  well  known  vector  identity  (2.2.6)  and  Gauss’s  law,  replacing  B   by 
μo H ,  and  using  Ampere’s  law  to  replace  ∇ × H .  In  both  cases  the  Helmholtz  wave  equation 
becomes: 

(∇ +2 ω2μ ε )

(wave equation) 

(2.3.21)

As  before,  the  solution  E ( )r   to  the  wave  equation  can  be  any  arbitrary  function  of  space 
( )r   such  that  its  second  spatial derivative  (∇2 E )  equals a constant  ( −ω ε2

function  E( r ) .  One  solution  with  these  properties  is  the  time-harmonic  version  of  the  time-

It  is  now  an  easy  matter  to  find  the  magnetic  field  that  corresponds  to  (2.3.22)  by  using 
Faraday’s law (2.3.16),  B = μo H , and the definition of the “∇×” operator (2.1.1):

As  before,  E   and  H   are  orthogonal  to  each  other  and  to  the  direction  of  propagation,  and 
E  = ηo H  . 

As another example, consider a z-polarized wave propagating in the -x direction; then:

(2.3.26) 

It  is  easy  to  convert phasor  expressions  such  as  (2.3.26)  into  time-domain  expressions.   We 
simply  divide  the  phasor  expressions  into  their  real  and  imaginary  parts,  and  note  that  the  real 
part  varies  as  cos(ωt  -  kz)  and  the  imaginary  part  varies  as  sin(ωt  -  kz).  Thus  the  fields  in 
(2.3.22) could be written instead as a real time-domain expression: 

E ( r, t  ) = yˆE
 

(
) 
o cos  ωt − kz  

 

(2.3.27)
 

Had  the  electric  field  solution  been  instead  the  phasor  yˆ jE o e− jkz ,  the  time  domain  expression

R {E ( )r  e j

E ( r, t  )  = −  yˆEo sin  ( ωt − k  z  ) 

(2.3.28)
 

The  conversion  of  complex  phasors  to  time-domain  expressions,  and  vice-versa,  is  discussed 
further in Appendix B. 

2.3.4  Wave polarization 

Complex  notation  simplifies  the  representation  of  wave  polarization,  which  characterizes  the 
behavior of the sinusoidally varying electric field vector as a function of time.  It is quite distinct 
from  the  polarization  of  media  discussed  in  Section  2.5.3.    Previously  we  have  seen  waves  for 
which  the  time-varying  electric vector points only  in  the ±x, ±y, or ±z directions,  corresponding 
to x, y, or z polarization, respectively.   By superimposing such waves at  the same frequency and 
propagating  in  the  same  direction  we  can  obtain  any  other  desired  time-harmonic  polarization. 
Linear  polarization  results  when  the  oscillating  electric  vector  points  only  along  a  single 
direction  in  the  plane  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  propagation,  while  elliptical  polarization 
results when  the x and y components of  the electric vector are out of phase  so  that  the  tip of  the 
electric  vector  traces  an  ellipse  in  the  same  plane.    Circular  polarization  results  only  when  the 
phase difference between x and y is 90 degrees and the two amplitudes are equal.  These various 
polarizations  for  +zˆ   propagation  are  represented  below  at  z  =  0  in  the  time  domain  and  as 
phasors, and in Figure 2.3.2.

The  Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics  Engineers  (IEEE)  has  defined  polarization  as 
right-handed  if  the  electric  vector  traces  a  right-handed  ellipse  in  the  x-y  plane  for  a  wave 
propagating  in  the  +z  direction,  as  suggested  in  Figure  2.3.3.    That  is,  for  right-handed 
polarization the fingers of the right hand circle in the direction taken by the electric vector while 
the thumb points in the direction of propagation.  This legal definition is opposite that commonly 
used in physics, where that alternative definition is consistent with the handedness of the “screw” 
formed by  the  instantaneous  three-dimensional  loci of  the  tips of  the electric vectors comprising 
a wave.

Relation between integral and differential forms of Maxwell’s equations 

2.4.1  Gauss’s divergence theorem 

Two  theorems  are  very  useful  in  relating  the  differential  and  integral  forms  of  Maxwell’s 
equations:  Gauss’s  divergence  theorem  and  Stokes  theorem.    Gauss’s  divergence  theorem 
(2.1.20)  states  that  the  integral  of  the  normal  component  of  an  arbitrary  analytic  vector  field  A 
over  a  surface  S  that  bounds  the  volume  V  equals  the  volume  integral  of  ∇ • A   over  V.  The 
theorem can be derived quickly by recalling (2.1.3): 

∇ • A ≡
 

∂A

(2.4.1)
 

Therefore  ∇ • A   at  the  position  xo,  yo,  zo  can  be  found  using  (2.4.1)  in  the  limit  where  Δx,  Δy, 
and Δz approach zero:

(2.4.4)

We may now stack an arbitrary number of such infinitesimal cubes to form a volume V such 
as that shown in Figure 2.4.1(b).  Then we can sum (2.4.4) over all these cubes to obtain:

Stokes’ theorem 

Stokes’ theorem states that the integral of the curl of a vector field over a bounded surface equals 
the  line  integral  of  that  vector  field  along  the  contour C  bounding  that  surface.   Its  derivation  is 
similar  to  that  for Gauss’s divergence  theorem  (Section 2.4.1), starting with  the definition of  the 
z component of the curl operator [from Equation (2.1.4)]:

Then (2.4.9) applied to ΔxΔy becomes: 
Δ Δx y (∇ × A  ) • n ˆ = (cid:118)∫ A • ds 
C

(2.4.10)

where  ds   is  a  vector  differential  length  [m]  along  the  contour  C  bounding  the  incremental  area 
defined by ΔxΔy = da.  The contour C is transversed in a right-hand sense relative to  nˆ .  We can 
assemble such infinitesimal areas to form surfaces of arbitrary shapes and area A, as suggested in 
Figure  2.4.2(b).  When  we  sum  (2.4.10)  over  all  these  infinitesimal  areas  da,  we  find  that  all 
contributions  to  the  right-hand  side  interior  to  the  area  A  cancel,  leaving  only  the  contributions 
from contour C along the border of A.  Thus (2.4.10) becomes Stokes’ theorem:

(2.4.11)
 

where  the  relation  between  the  direction  of  integration  around  the  loop  and  the  orientation  of  nˆ 
obey  the  right-hand  rule  (if  the  right-hand  fingers  curl  in  the  direction  of  ds ,  then  the  thumb 
points in the direction  nˆ ). 

2.4.3  Maxwell’s equations in integral form 

The  differential  form  of Maxwell’s  equations  (2.1.5–8)  can  be  converted  to  integral  form  using 
Gauss’s divergence theorem and Stokes’ theorem.  Faraday’s law (2.1.5) is: 

∇ × E = −

∂B 
∂t 

(2.4.12)

Applying Stokes’ theorem (2.4.11) to the curved surface A bounded by the contour C, we obtain:

E • ds = −

The  four  sketches  of  Maxwell’s  equations  presented  in  Figure  2.4.3  may  facilitate 
memorization; they can be interpreted  in either differential or  integral form because  they capture 
the underlying physics. 

Example 2.4A 
Using Gauss’s law, find  E  at distance r from a point charge q. 

Solution:  	 The  spherical  symmetry  of  the  problem  requires  E   to  be  radial,  and  Gauss’s  law 
requires  ∫ εo E • rˆ dA = ∫ ρ dv = q = 4πr 2

Solution:	 Because  the  geometry  of  this  problem  is  cylindrically  symmetric,  so  is  the  solution. 
Using  the  integral  form  of  Ampere’s  law  (2.4.15)  and  integrating  in  a  right-hand 
sense  around  a  circle  of  radius  r  centered  on  the  current  and  in  a  plane  orthogonal  to 
it, we obtain 2πrH = I, so⎯H =  θˆ 100/2π [A m-1].

The  great  success  of  Maxwell’s  equations  lies  partly  in  their  simple  prediction  of 
electromagnetic  waves  and  their  simple  characterization  of  materials  in  terms  of  conductivity 
σ [Siemens  m-1],  permittivity  ε  [Farads  m-1],  and  permeability  μ  [Henries  m-1].  In  vacuum  we

In  contrast,  the  nano-structure  of  media  can  be  quite  complex  and  requires  quantum 
mechanics  for  its  full  explanation.    Fortunately,  simple  classical  approximations  to  atoms  and 
molecules suffice to understand the origins of σ, ε, and μ, as discussed below in that sequence. 

2.5.2  Conductivity 

Conduction  in  metals  and  n-type  semiconductors6  involves  free  electrons  moving  many  atomic 
diameters before they lose momentum by interacting with atoms or other particles.  Acceleration 
induced  by  the  small  applied  electric  field  inside  the  conductor  restores  electron  velocities  to 
produce  an  equilibrium  current.    The  total  current  density  J   [A  m-2]  is  proportional  to  the 
product  of  the  average  electron  velocity  v   [m  s-1]  and  the  number  density  n  [m-3]  of  free 
electrons.  A related conduction process occurs in ionic liquids, where both negative and positive 
ions can carry charge long distances.

In  metals  there  is  approximately  one  free  electron  per  atom,  and  in  warm  n-type 
 
semiconductors  there  is approximately one free electron per donor atom, where  the sparse donor 
atoms are easily ionized thermally.  Since, for non-obvious reasons, the average electron velocity 
v is proportional  to  E ,  therefore  J = −en
3  v = σE , as  stated  in  (2.5.7).   As  the conductivity 
 
σ  approaches  infinity  the  electric  field  inside  a  conductor  approaches  zero  for  any  given  current 
density  J . 

Warm donor  atoms  in n-type  semiconductors  can be  easily  ionized  and  contribute  electrons 
to  the  conduction  band where  they move  freely.   Only  certain  types  of  impurity  atoms  function 
as donors--those that are most easily ionized.  As the density of donor atoms approaches zero and 
as  temperature  declines,  the  number  of  free  electrons  and  the  conductivity  approach  very  low 
values that depend on temperature and any alternative ionization mechanisms that are present.

In  p-type  semiconductors  the  added  impurity  atoms  readily  trap  nearby  free  electrons  to 
 
produce  a  negative  ion;  this  results  in  a  corresponding  number  of  positively  ionized 
semiconductor atoms that act as “holes”.  As a result any free electrons typically move only short 
distances before they are trapped by one of these holes.  Moreover, the threshold energy required 
to  move  an  electron  from  a  neutral  atom  to  an  adjacent  positive  ion  is  usually  less  than  the 
available  thermal energy, so such  transfers occur  rapidly, causing  the hole  to move quickly  from 

6 n-type semiconductors (e.g., silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, and others) are doped with a 
tiny  percentage  of  donor  atoms  that  ionize  easily  at  temperatures  of  interest,  releasing  mobile  electrons  into  the 
conduction  band  of  the  semiconductor  where  they  can  travel  freely  across  the  material  until  they  recombine  with 
another  ionized  donor  atom.    The  conduction  band  is  not  a  place;  it  refers  instead  to  an  energy  and  wave  state  of 
electrons  that  enables  them  to  move  freely.    The  conductivity  of  semiconductors  therefore  increases  with 
temperature;  they  become  relatively  insulating  at  low  temperatures,  depending  on  the  ionization  potentials  of  the 
impurity atoms.

place  to  place  over  long  distances.    Thus  holes  are  the  dominant  charge  carriers  in  p-type 
semiconductors, whereas electrons dominate in n-type semiconductors. 

  More  broadly,  semiconductors  have  a  conduction  band  in  which  free  electrons  can 
propagate long distances; this band is separated by an energy of one or a few electron volts from 
the valence band  in which electrons cannot move.   The conduction band  is not a  location,  it  is a 
family of possible electron wave states.  When electrons are excited from the valence band to the 
conduction  band  by  some  energetic  process,  they  become  free  to  move  in  response  to  electric 
fields.  Semiconductor conductivity is approximately proportional to the number of free electrons 
or  holes  produced  by  the  scarce  impurity  atoms,  and  therefore  to  the  doping  density  of  those 
impurity  atoms.   Easily  ionized  impurity  atoms  are  the  principal mechanism  by which  electrons 
enter  the  conduction  band,  and  impurities  that  readily  trap  adjacent  electrons  are  the  principal 
mechanism  by which  holes  enter  and move  in  the  valence  band.    Semiconductors  are  discussed 
further  in  Section  8.2.4.  The  current  leakage  processes  in  insulators  vaguely  resemble  electron 
and  hole  conduction  in  semiconductors,  and  can  include  weak  surface  currents  as  well  as  bulk 
conduction;  microscopic  flaws  can  also  increase  conductivity.  The  conductivities  of  typical 
materials are listed in Table 2.5.1.

In  some  exotic  materials  the  conductivity  is  a  function  of  direction  and  can  be  represented 
by  the  3×3 matrix  σ ;  such materials  are  not  addressed  here,  but  Section  2.5.3  addresses  similar 
issues in the context of permittivity ε. 

Some  materials  exhibit  superconductivity,  or  infinite  conductivity.    In  these materials  pairs 
 
of  electrons  become  loosely  bound  magnetically  and  move  as  a  unit  called  a  Cooper  pair. 
Quantum  mechanics  prevents  these  pairs  from  colliding  with  the  lattice  and  losing  energy. 
Because  the  magnetic  binding  energy  for  these  pairs  involves  electron  spins,  it  is  quite  small. 
Normal conductivity returns above a threshold critical temperature at which the pairs are shaken 
apart,  and  it  also  returns  above  some  threshold  critical  magnetic  field  at  which  the  magnetic 
bonds  coupling  the  electrons  break  as  the  electron  spins  all  start  to  point  in  the  same  direction. 
Materials  having  critical  temperatures  above  77K  (readily  obtained  in  cryogenic  refrigerators) 
are  difficult  to  achieve.    The  finite  number  of  such  pairs  at  any  temperature  and  magnetic  field 
limits the current to some maximum value; moreover that current itself produces a magnetic field 
that can disrupt pairs.  Even a few pairs can move so as to reduce electric fields to zero by short-
circuiting  the  normal  electrons  until  the  maximum  current  carrying  capacity  of  those  pairs  is 
exceeded.  If  the  applied  fields  have  frequency  f  >  0,  then  the  Cooper  pairs  behave  much  like 
collisionless  electrons  in  a  plasma  and  therefore  the  applied  electric  field  can  penetrate  that 
plasma  to  its  skin  depth,  as  discussed  in  Section  9.8.    Those  penetrating  electric  fields  interact

with  a  small number of normal  electrons  to produce  tiny  losses  in  superconductors  that  increase 
with frequency. 

2.5.3 

Permittivity 

The  permittivity  εo  of  free  space  is  8.854×10-12  farads/meter, where⎯D  =  εo E .  The  permittivity 
ε of  any material deviates  from εo  for  free  space  if  applied  electric  fields  induce  electric dipoles 
in  the medium;  such  dipoles  alter  the  applied  electric  field  seen  by  neighboring  atoms.   Electric 
fields  generally  distort  atoms  because  E   pulls  on  positively  charged  nuclei  ( f
qE   [N])  and 
=
repels  the  surrounding negatively  charged  electron  clouds.   The  resulting  small offset  d  of  each 
atomic nucleus of charge +q relative to the center of its associated electron cloud produces a tiny 
electric  dipole  in  each  atom,  as  suggested  in  Figure  2.5.1(a).    In  addition,  most  asymmetric 
molecules  are permanently polarized,  such  as H2O or NH3,  and  can  rotate within  fluids or gases 
to  align with  an  applied  field.   Whether  the  dipole moments  are  induced,  or  permanent  and  free 
to  rotate,  the  result  is  a  complete  or  partial  alignment  of  dipole moments  as  suggested  in  Figure 
2.5.1(b). 

These  polarization  charges  generally  cancel  inside  the  medium,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
2.5.1(b),  but  the  immobile  atomic  dipoles  on  the  outside  surfaces  of  the  medium  are  not  fully 
cancelled and therefore contribute the surface polarization charge ρsp.

Figure 2.5.1  Polarized media. 
 

Figure  2.5.1(c)  suggests  how  two  charged  plates  might  provide  an  electric  field  E   that  
polarizes a dielectric slab having permittivity ε > εo.  [The electric field  E  is the same in vacuum 

- 44 -


as  it  is  inside  the dielectric (assuming no air gaps) because  the path  integral of  E d• s   from plate 
to  plate  equals  their  voltage  difference  V  in  both  cases.    The  electric  displacement  vector 
De  = εE   and  therefore  differs.]  We  associate  the  difference  between  Do  = εo E   (vacuum)  and 
Dε  = εE  (dielectric) with the electric polarization vector  P , where: 

D = εE   = εo E + P = ε o E (1   + χ )  

(2.5.8)

The  polarization  vector  P   is  defined  by  (2.5.8)  and  is  normally  parallel  to  E   in  the  same 
direction,  as  shown  in  Figure  2.5.1(c);  it  points  from  the  negative  surface  polarization  charge  to 
the  positive  surface  polarization  charge  (unlike  E ,  which  points  from  positive  charges  to 
,  where  χ  is  defined  as  the  dimensionless 
negative  ones).  As  suggested  in  (2.5.8),  P = Eε χo 
susceptibility of the dielectric.  Because nuclei are bound rather tightly to their electron clouds, χ 
is  generally  less  than  3  for  most  atoms,  although  some  molecules  and  crystals,  particularly  in 
fluid form, can exhibit much higher values.  It is shown later in (2.5.13) that  P  simply equals the 
product  of  the  number  density  n  of  these  dipoles  and  the  average  vector  electric  dipole moment 
of  each  atom  or molecule,  p = qd , where  d   is  the  offset  (meters)  of  the  positive  charge  relative 
to the negative charge: 

P = nqd

-2 ⎤⎦ 
 ⎡⎣C m  

(2.5.9)

Gauss’s  law  relates  D   to  charge  density  ρ  [C m-2],  but we  now  have  two  types  of  density: 
that of  free charges ρf,  including  ions and surface charges on conductors, and  that of any  locally 
un-neutralized  polarization  charge ρp  bound within  charge-neutral  atoms  or molecules.   Gauss’s 
law says: 

∇ • D = ρ f 

where ρf is the free charge density [C m-3]. 

(2.5.10)
 

We can derive a relation similar  to (2.5.10) for  P  by treating materials as distributed bound 
positive  and  negative  charges  with  vacuum  between  them;  the  net  bound  charge  density  is 
designated the polarization charge density  ρp [C m-3].  Then in the vacuum between the charges 
D = εo E  and (2.5.10) becomes: 

ε ∇ • E = ρ  + ρ 
o 
f
p 

(2.5.11)

From ∇ • (2.5.8), we obtain  ∇ • D = ε  ∇ • E + ∇ • P = ρ 
f  .  Combining this with (2.5.11) yields: 
o

∇ • P = −ρp  

(2.5.12)
 

- 45 -


The  negative  sign  in  (2.5.12)  is  consistent  with  the  fact  that  P ,  unlike  E ,  is  directed  from 
negative to positive polarization charge, as noted earlier. 

Outside  a  polarized  dielectric  the  polarization  P   is  zero,  as  suggested  by  Figure  2.5.1(d). 
Note  that  the  net  polarization  charge  density  is  ±nq  for  only  an  atomic-scale  distance  d  at  the 
boundaries  of  the  dielectric,  where  we  model  the  positive  and  negative  charge  distributions 
within  the  medium  as  continuous  uniform  rectilinear  slabs  of  density  ±  nq  [C  m-3].  These  two 
slabs  are  offset  by  the  distance  d.    If  P   is  in  the  z  direction  and  arises  from  n  dipole  moments 
p qd  per  cubic meter, where  d   is  the offset  [m] of  the positive  charge  relative  to  the negative 
=
charge, then (2.5.12) can be integrated over a volume V that encloses a unit area of the left-hand 
face  of  a  polarized  dielectric  [see  Figure  2.5.1(d)]  to  yield  the  polarization  vector  P   inside  the  
dielectric: 

∇ • P dv = − ∫V 
P = ∫V 
ρp  dv = nqd 

(2.5.13) 

The  first  equality  of  (2.5.13)  involving⎯P  follows  from Gauss’s  divergence  theorem:  ∫V∇ • P dv 
= ∫A P z•  ˆ da = Pz if A = 1.  Therefore,  P = nqd  , proving (2.5.9). 

When the electric displacement⎯D varies with time it becomes displacement current, ∂ D /∂t 
[A/m2],  analogous  to⎯J,  as  suggested  by  Ampere's  law:    ∇  ×⎯H  =⎯J  +  ∂ D /∂t.   For  reference, 
Table  2.5.2  presents  the  dielectric  constants  ε/εo  for  some  common materials  near  1 MHz,  after

Most  dielectric  materials  are  lossy  because  oscillatory  electric  fields  dither  the  directions 
and  magnitudes  of  the  induced  electric  dipoles,  and  some  of  this  motion  heats  the  dielectric. 
This  effect  can  be  represented  by  a  frequency-dependent  complex  permittivity  ε ,  as  discussed 
further  in  Section  9.5.    Some  dielectrics  have  direction-dependent  permittivities  that  can  be 
represented  by  ε ;  such  anisotropic  materials  are  discussed  in  Section  9.6.    Lossy  anisotropic 
materials can be characterized by  ε . 

Some  special  dielectric  media  are  spontaneously  polarized,  even  in  the  absence  of  an 
externally applied  E .  This occurs for highly polarizable media where orientation of one electric 
dipole  in  the  media  can  motivate  its  neighbors  to  orient  themselves  similarly,  forming  domains 

- 46 -


of  atoms,  molecules,  or  crystal  unit  cells  that  are  all  polarized  the  same.    Such  spontaneously 
polarized  domains  are  illustrated  for  magnetic  materials  in  Figure  2.5.2.    As  in  the  case  of 
ferromagnetic domains,  in  the absence of externally applied  fields, domain size  is  limited by  the 
buildup  of  stored  field  energy  external  to  the  domain;  adjacent  domains  are  oriented  so  as  to 
largely cancel each other.  Such  ferroelectric materials have  large effective values of ε, although 
D   saturates  if  E   is  sufficient  to  produce  ~100%  alignment  of  polarization.  They  can  also 
exhibit hysteresis as do the ferromagnetic materials discussed in Section 2.5.4.

Permeability 

The  permeability  μ   of  free  space  is  4π10-7
  Henries/meter  by  definition,  where⎯B  =  μ H .  The 
o
permeability  μ  of  matter  includes  the  additional  contributions  to  B   from  atomic  magnetic 
dipoles  aligning  with  the  applied  H .    These  magnetic  dipoles  and  their  associated  magnetic 
fields arise either from electrons orbiting about atomic nuclei or from spinning charged particles, 
where such moving charge is current.  All electrons and protons have spin ±1/2 in addition to any 
orbital  spin  about  the  nucleus,  and  the  net  spin  of  an  atom  or  nucleus  can  be  non-zero.    Their 
magnetic  fields  are  linked  to  their  equivalent  currents  by  Ampere’s  law,  ∇ × H = J + ∂D   ∂t . 
Quantum  theory describes how  these magnetic moments are quantized at discrete  levels, and  for 
some devices quantum descriptions are necessary.  In this text we average over large numbers of 
atoms, so that  B = μH  accurately characterizes media, and quantum effects can be ignored. 

In  any  medium  the  cumulative  contribution  of  induced  magnetic  dipoles  to  B   is  
characterized by the magnetization  M , which is defined by: 

B = μH = μ  ( H + M ) = μ

where  χm  is  the  magnetic  susceptibility  of  the  medium.    Because  of  quantum  effects  χm  for 
diamagnetic  materials  is  slightly  negative  so  that  μ  <  μo;  examples  include  silver,  copper,  and 
water, as  listed  in Table 2.5.3.  The  table also  lists  representative paramagnetic materials, which 
have  slightly  positive  magnetic  susceptibilities,  and  ferromagnetic  materials,  which  have  very 
large susceptibilities (e.g., cobalt, etc.).

The  sharp  difference  between  normal  materials  with  μ ≅ μo  and  ferromagnetic  materials 
having  μ  >>  μo  is  due  to  the  spontaneous  alignment  of  atomic  magnetic  dipoles  in  the  same 
direction  so  as  to  increase  the  applied  field,  reorienting  the  remaining  dipoles.    That  is,  if  the 
susceptibility  of  a  material  is  above  some  threshold,  then  the  atomic  magnetic  dipoles 
spontaneously  align  over  regions  of  size  limited  by  grain  structure  or  energy  considerations,  as 
suggested  in  Figure  2.5.2(a  and  b).    These  regions  of  nearly  perfect  alignment  are  called 
magnetic  domains.  These  domains  are  normally  quite  small  (perhaps  micron-size)  so  as  to 
minimize  the  stored magnetic  energy μH2.  In  this  regime,  if  only  energy  considerations  control 
domain  size,  then  the  sizes  of  those  domains  oriented  in  the  general  direction  of  the  applied 
magnetic  field  grow  as  that  field  increases,  while  other  domains  shrink,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
2.5.2(c).  Since domain walls cannot easily move across grain walls, the granular structure of the 
material  can  be  engineered  to  control  magnetic  properties.    If  domain  walls  move  easily,  the 
magnetic susceptability χm is large.

At  sufficiently  high  magnetic  fields  all  domains  will  expand  to  their  maximum  size  and/or 
rotate  in  the  direction  of  H .    This  corresponds  to  the  maximum  value  of  M   and  magnetic 
saturation.  The  resulting  typical  non-linear  behavior  of  the magnetization  curve  relating  B  and 
H  for  ferromagnetic materials  is  suggested  in Figure 2.5.3(a).   The  slope of  the B vs. H curve  is

~μ near  the origin and ~μo beyond saturation.  If  the domains  resist change and dissipate energy 
when  doing  so,  the  hysteresis  curve  of  Figure  2.5.3(b)  results.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  area 
enclosed by the figure is the energy dissipated per cycle as the applied  H  oscillates.

If we represent the magnetic dipole moment of an atom by m, where  m  for a current loop of 
magnitude I and area  nˆA  is  nˆIA  [A m]7, then it can be shown that the total magnetization  M  of  
a  medium  is  n m   [A  m-1]  via  the  same  approach  used  to  derive  P = n p (2.5.13)  for  the 
polarization of dielectrics; n is the number of dipoles per m3.

from +Ho  to  -Ho and back  to +Ho.  The energy density Wm = BH/2 when B = 0 at  t = 
0  is  Wm  =  0;  W →B H /2  [J  m-3

energy  is  dissipated  and  cannot  be  recovered  by  an  external  circuit  because  any 
voltage  induced  in  that circuit would be ∝ ∂B/∂t = 0.   As H→-Ho, Wm→BoHo/2;  this 
energy  can  be  recovered  by  an  external  circuit  later  as  B→0  because  ∂B/∂t  ≠  0.    As  
B→-Bo, Wm→BoHo/2, which  is  lost  later as H→0 with ∂B/∂t = 0.  The energy stored

as H→Ho with B = -Bo is again recoverable as B→0 with H = Ho.  Thus the minimum 
energy  dissipated  during  one  loop  traverse  is  vBoHo[J],  where  v  is  material  volume. 
If  the  drive  circuits  do  not  recapture  the  available  energy  but  dissipate  it,  the  total 
energy dissipated per cycle is doubled.

Boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields 

2.6.1 

Introduction 

Maxwell’s  equations  characterize  macroscopic  matter  by  means  of  its  permittivity  ε, 
permeability μ, and conductivity σ, where these properties are usually represented by scalars and 
can  vary  among  media.    Section  2.5  discussed  media  for  which  ε,  μ,  and  σ  are  represented  by 
matrices,  complex  quantities,  or  other  means.    This  Section  2.6  discusses  how  Maxwell’s 
equations  strongly  constrain  the  behavior  of  electromagnetic  fields  at  boundaries  between  two 
media  having  different  properties,  where  these  constraint  equations  are  called  boundary 
conditions.  Section  2.6.2  discusses  the  boundary  conditions  governing  field  components 
perpendicular  to  the  boundary,  and Section  2.6.3  discusses  the  conditions  governing  the  parallel 
field  components.    Section  2.6.4  then  treats  the  special  case  of  fields  adjacent  to  perfect 
conductors. 

One  result  of  these  boundary  conditions  is  that  waves  at  boundaries  are  generally  partially 
transmitted  and  partially  reflected with  directions  and  amplitudes  that  depend  on  the  two media 
and  the  incident  angles  and  polarizations.    Static  fields  also  generally  have  different  amplitudes 
and  directions  on  the  two  sides  of  a  boundary.    Some  boundaries  in  both  static  and  dynamic 
situations  also  possess  surface  charge  or  carry  surface  currents  that  further  affect  the  adjacent 
fields. 

2.6.2  Boundary conditions for perpendicular field components 

The boundary conditions governing  the perpendicular components of  E  and  H   follow  from  the 
integral forms of Gauss’s laws:

(2.6.1) 

We  may  integrate  these  equations  over  the  surface  S  and  volume  V  of  the  thin  infinitesimal 
pillbox  illustrated  in  Figure  2.6.1.    The  pillbox  is  parallel  to  the  surface  and  straddles  it,  half 
being  on  each  side  of  the  boundary.  The  thickness  δ  of  the  pillbox  approaches  zero  faster  than 
does its surface area S, where S is approximately twice the area A of the top surface of the box.

Beginning  with  the  boundary  condition  for  the  perpendicular  component  D⊥,  we  integrate 
Gauss’s law (2.6.1) over the pillbox to obtain: 
(cid:119)∫∫S ( D • nˆa ) da
≅ ( D1⊥ − D2⊥ ) A = ∫∫∫V 
 
ρ  dv
where  ρs  is  the  surface  charge  density  [Coulombs  m-2].  The  subscript  s  for  surface  charge  ρs 
distinguishes  it from  the volume charge density ρ [C m-3]. The pillbox is so thin (δ → 0)  that: 1) 
the  contribution  to  the  surface  integral  of  the  sides  of  the  pillbox  vanishes  in  comparison  to  the 
rest  of  the  integral,  and  2)  only  a  surface  charge  q  can  be  contained within  it, where ρs  =  q/A  = 
lim ρδ as the charge density ρ → ∞ and δ → 0.  Thus (2.6.3) becomes D1⊥ - D2⊥ = ρs, which can 
be written as: 

 
= ρ sA 

(2.6.3) 

nˆ • ( D1 − D2 ) = ρ s 

(boundary condition for  D⊥ ) 

(2.6.4) 

where  nˆ   is  the  unit  vector  normal  to  the  boundary  and  points  into  medium  1.    Thus  the 
perpendicular  component  of  the  electric  displacement  vector  D   changes  value  at  a  boundary  in 
accord with the surface charge density ρs. 

Because Gauss’s  laws are  the same  for electric and magnetic  fields, except  that  there are no 
magnetic  charges,  the  same  analysis  for  the magnetic  flux  density  B   in  (2.6.2)  yields  a  similar 
boundary condition: 

nˆ • ( B1 − B2 ) = 0 

(boundary condition for  B⊥ ) 

(2.6.5) 

Thus the perpendicular component of  B  must be continuous across any boundary.

2.6.3  Boundary conditions for parallel field components 

The boundary conditions governing  the parallel components of  E  and  H  follow from Faraday’s 
and Ampere’s laws:

We  can  integrate  these  equations  around  the  elongated  rectangular  contour  C  that  straddles  the 
boundary and has infinitesimal area A, as  illustrated  in Figure 2.6.2.   We assume  the  total height 
δ of the rectangle is much less than its length W, and circle C in a right-hand sense relative to the 
surface normal  nˆa .

(2.6.8) 

where  the  integral  of  B   over  area A  approaches  zero  in  the  limit where  δ  approaches  zero  too; 
there can be no  impulses  in  B .  Since W ≠ 0,  it  follows  from  (2.6.8)  that E1//  - E2// = 0, or more 
generally: 

nˆ × ( E1 − E 2 ) = 0 

(boundary condition for  E // ) 

(2.6.9) 

Thus the parallel component of  E  must be continuous across any boundary. 

A  similar  integration  of  Ampere’s  law,  (2.6.7),  under  the  assumption  that  the  contour  C  is 
chosen  to  lie  in a plane perpendicular  to  the surface current  Js  and  is  traversed  in  the right-hand 
sense, yields:

(2.6.10) 

where we note that the area integral of  ∂D t∂  approaches zero as δ → 0, but not the integral over 
the  surface  current  Js , which  occupies  a  surface  layer  thin  compared  to  δ.  Thus  H1 //  − H2 //   = 
Js , or more generally: 

nˆ × ( H1 − H 2 ) = Js 

(boundary condition for  H // ) 

(2.6.11) 

where  nˆ   is  defined  as  pointing  from  medium  2  into  medium  1.    If  the  medium  is  non­
conducting,⎯Js = 0. 

A  simple  static  example  illustrates  how  these  boundary  conditions  generally  result  in  fields 
on two sides of a boundary pointing in different directions.  Consider the magnetic fields  H1  and 
H2   illustrated  in  Figure  2.6.3,  where  μ2  ≠ μ1,  and  both  media  are  insulators  so  the  surface 
current must  be  zero.    If we  are  given  H1 ,  then  the magnitude  and  angle  of  H2   are  determined 
because  H //   and  B⊥   are  continuous  across  the  boundary, where  Bi  = μi Hi .  More  specifically, 
H2 //  = H1 //  , and: 

H2⊥ = B2⊥ μ2  = B1⊥ μ2  = μ 1H1⊥ μ2

Thus  θ2  approaches  90  degrees  when  μ2  >>  μ1,  almost  regardless  of  θ1,  so  the  magnetic  flux 
inside  high  permeability  materials  is  nearly  parallel  to  the  walls  and  trapped  inside,  even  when 
the  field  orientation  outside  the  medium  is  nearly  perpendicular  to  the  interface.    The  flux 
escapes high-μ material best when θ1  ≅ 90°.  This phenomenon is critical to the design of motors 
or other systems incorporating iron or nickel. 

If  a  static  surface  current  Js   flows  at  the  boundary,  then  the  relations  between  B1   and  B2 
are altered along with  those  for  H1  and  H2 .  Similar considerations and methods apply  to static 
electric  fields  at  a  boundary,  where  any  static  surface  charge  on  the  boundary  alters  the 
relationship  between  D1   and  D2 .  Surface  currents  normally  arise  only  in  non-static  or 
“dynamic” cases. 

Example 2.6A 
Two  insulating  planar  dielectric  slabs  having  ε1  and  ε2  are  bonded  together.  Slab  1  has  E1   at 
angle  θ1  to  the  surface  normal.    What  are  E 2   and  θ2  if  we  assume  the  surface  charge  at  the 
 
boundary ρs = 0?  What are the components of  E 2  if ρs  ≠ 0?

2.6.4  Boundary conditions adjacent to perfect conductors 

The  four  boundary  conditions  (2.6.4),  (2.6.5),  (2.6.9),  and  (2.6.11)  are  simplified  when  one 
medium  is  a  perfect  conductor  (σ = ∞)  because  electric  and magnetic  fields must  be  zero  inside 
it.  The  electric  field  is  zero  because  otherwise  it  would  produce  enormous  J = σE   so  as  to  
redistribute  the  charges  and  to  neutralize  that  E   almost  instantly,  with  a  time  constant  τ = ε σ 
seconds, as shown in Equation (4.3.3). 

It  can  also  be  easily  shown  that  B   is  zero  inside  perfect  conductors.    Faraday’s  law  says 
E = − B  t 
∂ ∂ ,  so  if 
E 0 ,  then  ∂ 
B ∂ =t  0 . 
If  the  perfect  conductor  were  created  in  the 
∇ × 
= 
absence of  B   then  B  would always  remain zero  inside.    It has  further been observed  that when 
certain  special  materials  become  superconducting  at  low  temperatures,  as  discussed  in  Section 
2.5.2, any pre-existing⎯B is thrust outside. 

The  boundary  conditions  for  perfect  conductors  are  also  relevant  for  normal  conductors 
because  most  metals  have  sufficient  conductivity  σ  to  enable  J   and  ρs  to  cancel  the  incident 
electric  field,  although  not  instantly.    As  discussed  in  Section  4.3.1,  this  relaxation  process  by 
which  charges  move  to  cancel  E   is  sufficiently  fast  for  most  metallic  conductors  that  they 

- 54 -


largely  obey  the  perfect-conductor  boundary  conditions  for  most  wavelengths  of  interest,  from 
DC  to  beyond  the  infrared  region.  This  relaxation  time  constant  is  τ  =  ε/σ  seconds.  One 
consequence  of  finite  conductivity  is  that  any  surface  current  penetrates  metals  to  some  depth 
δ =  2 ωμσ , called  the skin depth, as discussed  in Section 9.2.   At sufficiently  low frequencies, 
even  sea  water  with  its  limited  conductivity  largely  obeys  the  perfect-conductor  boundary 
condition. 

The  four  boundary  conditions  for  fields  adjacent  to  perfect  conductors  are  presented  below 
together  with  the  more  general  boundary  condition  from  which  they  follow  when  all  fields  in 
medium 2 are zero:

(2.6.17) 

These  four  boundary  conditions  state  that  magnetic  fields  can  only  be  parallel  to  perfect 
conductors,  while  electric  fields  can  only  be  perpendicular.    Moreover,  the  magnetic  fields  are 
always associated with surface currents flowing  in an orthogonal direction;  these currents have a 
numerical  value  equal  to  H .    The  perpendicular  electric  fields  are  always  associated  with  a 
surface  charge  ρs  numerically  equal  to  D ;  the  sign  of  σ  is  positive  when  D   points  away  from 
the conductor. 

Example 2.6B 
What boundary conditions apply when μ→∞, σ = 0, and ε = εo? 

Solution:  Inside  this  medium  H = 0   and  J = 0   because  otherwise  infinite  energy  densities, 
μ|H|2/2,  are  required;  static  E   and   B   are  unconstrained,  however. 
Since 
∇ × H = 0 = J + ∂D   ∂t  inside, dynamic  E  and  D = 0  there too.  Since  H //  and  B⊥  are 
continuous  across  the  boundary,  H //  = 0   and  H⊥   can  be  anything  at  the  boundary. 
Since  E //  and  D⊥  are continuous  (let’s assume ρs = 0  if  J =
 0 ), static  E  and  D  are  
unconstrained  at  the  boundary  while  dynamic  E = D = 0
   there  because  there  is  no 
dynamic  electric  field  inside  and  no  dynamic  surface  charge.    Since  only  H⊥ ≠ 0  at 
the  boundary,  this  is  non-physical  and  such media  don’t  exist.   For  example,  there  is 
no  way  to  match  boundary  conditions  for  an  incoming  plane  wave.    This  impasse 
would be avoided if σ ≠ 0, for then dynamic  H //  and  E⊥  could be non-zero.

Power and energy in the time and frequency domains, Poynting theorem 

2.7.1 

Poynting theorem and definition of power and energy in the time domain 

To derive  the Poynting  theorem we  can manipulate Maxwell’s  equations  to produce products of 
variables  that  have  the  dimensions  and  character  of  power  or  energy.    For  example,  the  power 
dissipated  in  a  resistor  is  the  product  of  its  voltage  and  current,  so  the  product  E • J   [W  m-3]
would  be  of  interest.  The  dimensions  of  E   and  J   are  volts  per  meter  and  amperes  per  square 
meter, respectively.  Faraday’s and Ampere’s laws are:

We can produce  the product  E • J  and preserve symmetry  in  the resulting equation by  taking  the 
dot  product  of  E   with  Ampere’s  law  and  subtracting  from  it  the  dot  product  of  H   with 
Faraday’s law, yielding:

2.7.2  Complex Poynting theorem and definition of complex power and energy 

Unfortunately  we  cannot  blindly  apply  to  power  and  energy  our  standard  conversion  protocol 
between  frequency-domain  and  time-domain  representations  because  we  no  longer  have  only  a 
single  frequency  present.  Time-harmonic  power  and  energy  involve  the  products  of  sinusoids 
and  therefore  exhibit  sum  and  difference  frequencies.    More  explicitly,  we  cannot  simply 
represent  the  Poynting  vector  S( t ) for  a  field  at  frequency  f  [Hz]  by  Re {S e j
tω }   because  power 
has  components  at  both  f  =  0  and  2f  Hz,  where  ω =  2πf.  Nonetheless  we  can  use  the 
convenience of the time-harmonic notation by restricting it to fields, voltages, and currents while 
representing their products, i.e. power and energy, only by their complex averages. 

To  understand  the  definitions  of  complex  power  and  energy,  consider  the  product  of  two 
sinusoids, a(t) and b(t), where:

power  flowing  into  a  volume  is  generally  associated  with  an  excess  of  time-average  magnetic 
energy storage over electric energy storage in that volume, and vice-versa, with negative reactive

2.8  Uniqueness theorem 

Throughout  this  text we  often  implicitly  assume  uniqueness when we  first  guess  the  solution  to 
Maxwell’s  equations  for  a  given  set  of  boundary  conditions  and  then  test  that  solution  against 
those equations.  This process does not guarantee  that  the  resulting  solution  is unique, and often 
there  are  an  infinite  number  of  possible  solutions,  of  which  we  might  guess  only  one.    The 

- 62 -

uniqueness  theorem  is  quite  useful  for  it  sets  forth  constraints  on  the  boundary  conditions  that 
guarantee there is only one solution to Maxwell’s equations, which we can find as usual. 

To prove  the uniqueness  theorem we begin by  considering  a volume V  enclosed by  surface 
S and governed by Maxwell’s equations: 

∇ • Di  = ρ	

∇ •B 0 
i  =

∂B
i 
∇ × E  i  = − 
∂t	

∇ × H  i  = J +

∂D
i	
∂t 

(2.8.1)
 

(2.8.2)

where i = 1, 2 correspond to two possible solutions consistent with the given source distributions 
ρ and  J .  We can now show that the difference  Ad  = A1 − A2  between these two solutions must 
be  zero  under  certain  conditions,  and  therefore  there  can  then  be  no more  than  one  solution:  A 
represents  D,  B,   E,  H,  or  J . 

If we subtract (2.8.1) for i = 2 from (2.8.1) for i = 1 we obtain: 

∇ • ( D1 − D 2 ) = ∇ • D  d  = 0	

(2.8.3)
 

Similar  subtraction of corresponding equations  for  (2.8.2) yield  three more Maxwell’s equations 
that the difference fields  Bd  and  Dd  must satisfy: 

∇ • Bd  = 0 

∇ × E  d  = −

∂B
d 
 
∂t 

∇ × H  d  =

∂D
d	
∂t 

(2.8.4)

where we note that the source terms ρ and  J  have vanished from (2.8.3) and (2.8.4) because they 
are given and fixed. 

The boundary constraints that ensure uniqueness are: 

(1)  	At  some  time  t  =  0  the  fields  are  known  everywhere  so  that  at  that  instant 
Ed  = Dd  = Hd  = Bd  = 0 . 

(2)  	 At all  times and at each point on  the  surface S either  the  tangential  E  or  the  tangential 
H  is known. 

Applying Poynting’s theorem (2.7.10) to the difference fields at time t proves uniqueness subject 
to these constraints: 

∫∫∫ ⎡
V ⎣⎢

Hd  •

∂Bd 
∂t 

+ Ed  •

∂D ⎤
d  dv
∂t  ⎦⎥

+ (cid:119)∫∫ ( Ed × Hd ) • da
 
S

= 0	

 

(2.8.5) 

- 63 -


Boundary constraint (2) ensures that the tangential component of either  Ed  or  Hd  is always 
zero,  thus  forcing  the  cross  product  in  the  second  integral  of  (2.8.5)  to  zero  everywhere  on  the 
enclosing  surface  S.    The  first  integral  can  be  simplified  if  D = εE  and  B = μH ,  where  both  ε 
and  μ  can  be  functions  of  position.    Because  this  volume  integral  then  involves  only  the  time 
2 ) ,  and  because  these  fields  are 
derivative  of  the  squares  of  the  difference  fields  ( 
2 
and   Ed
Hd 
zero  at  t  =  0  by  virtue  of  constraint  (1),  the  difference  fields  can  never  depart  from  zero  while 
satisfying (2.8.5).   Since (2.8.5) holds for all  time, the difference fields must  therefore always be 
zero  everywhere,  meaning  there  can  be  no  more  than  one  solution  to  Maxwell’s  equations 
subject to the two constraints listed above.
