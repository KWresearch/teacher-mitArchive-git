9.1  Waves at planar boundaries at normal incidence 

9.1.1 

Introduction 

Chapter  9  treats  the  propagation  of  plane  waves  in  vacuum  and  simple  media,  at  planar 
boundaries, and in combinations confined between sets of planar boundaries, as in waveguides or 
cavity  resonators.   Chapter 10  then discusses how  such waves  can be generated  and  received by 
antennas and antenna arrays. 

More  specifically,  Section  9.1  explains  how  plane  waves  are  reflected  from  planar 
boundaries  at  normal  incidence,  and  Section  9.2  treats  reflection  and  refraction when  the waves 
are  incident  at  arbitrary  angles.    Section  9.3  then  explains  how  linear  combinations  of  such 
waves  can  satisfy  all  boundary  conditions  when  they  are  confined  within  parallel  plates  or 
rectangular  cylinders  acting  as  waveguides.    By  adding  planar  boundaries  at  the  ends  of  such 
waveguides,  waves  can  be  trapped  at  the  resonant  frequencies  of  the  resulting  cavity,  as 
explained  in  Section  9.4.  Sections  9.5  then  treat  waves  in  anisotropic,  dispersive,  and  ionized 
media, respectively. 

9.1.2 

Introduction to boundary value problems 

Section  2.2  showed  how  uniform  planes  waves  could  propagate  in  any  direction  with  any 
polarization,  and  could  be  superimposed  in  any  combination  to  yield  a  total  electromagnetic 
field.  The  general  electromagnetic  boundary  value  problem  treated  in  Sections  9.1–4  involves 
determining  exactly  which,  if  any,  combination  of  waves  matches  any  given  set  of  boundary 
conditions, which are the relations between the electric and magnetic fields adjacent to both sides 
of  each  boundary.  These  boundaries  can  generally  be  both  active  and  passive,  the  active 
boundaries  usually  being  sources.   Boundary  conditions  generally  constrain  E   and/or  H   for  all 
time on the boundary of the two- or three-dimensional region of interest. 

The  uniqueness  theorem  presented  in  Section  2.8  states  that  only  one  solution  satisfies  all 
Maxwell’s equations if the boundary conditions are sufficient. Therefore we may solve boundary 
value  problems  simply  by  hypothesizing  the  correct  combination  of waves  and  testing  it  against 
Maxwell’s  equations.  That  is, we  leave  undetermined  the  numerical  constants  that  characterize 
the  chosen  combination  of  waves,  and  then  determine  which  values  of  those  constraints  satisfy 
Maxwell’s  equations.  This  strategy  eases  the  challenge  of  hypothesizing  the  final  answer 
directly.  Moreover,  symmetry  and  other  considerations  often  suggest  the  nature  of  the  wave 
combination required by the problem, thus reducing the numbers of unknown constants that must 
be determined. 

The four basic steps for solving boundary value problems are: 

1)  	  Determine the natural behavior of each homogeneous section of the system in isolation 
(absent its boundaries). 

- 255 -
 

2)  	  Express  this natural behavior  as  the  superposition of waves  characterized by unknown 
constants;  symmetry  and  other  considerations  can  minimize  the  number  of  waves 
required.  Here  our  basic  building  blocks  are  usually  uniform  plane  waves,  but  other 
more compact expansions are typically used if the symmetry of the problem permits, as 
illustrated  in  Section  4.5.2  for  cylindrical  and  spherical  geometries,  Section  7.2.2  for 
TEM transmission lines, and Section 9.3.1 for waveguide modes. 

3)  	  Write  equations  for  the  boundary  conditions  that  must  be  satisfied  by  these  sets  of 
superimposed waves, and then solve for the unknown constants. 

4)  	  Test  the  resulting  solution  against  any  of  Maxwell’s  equations  that  have  not  already 
been imposed. 

Variations  of  this  four-step  procedure  can  be  used  to  solve  almost  any  problem  by  replacing 
Maxwell’s equations with their approximate equivalent for the given problem domain. 

9.1.3  Reflection from perfect conductors 

One  of  the  simplest  examples  of  a  boundary  value  problem  is  that  of  a  uniform  plane  wave  in 
vacuum  normally  incident  upon  a  planar  perfect  conductor  at  z  ≥  0,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
9.1.1(a).  Step  1  of  the  general  boundary-problem  solution method  of  Section  9.1.2  is  simply  to 
note  that  electromagnetic  fields  in  the  medium  can  be  represented  by  superimposed  uniform 
plane waves.

For  this  incompletely  defined  example,  the  initial  part  of  Step  2  of  the  method  involves 
refinement  of  the  problem  definition  by  describing  more  explicitly  the  incident  wave,  for 
example: 

E ( z, t  ) = xˆEo cos  (ωt − kz )  ⎣⎡Vm-1 ⎤⎦	 

(9.1.1) 

where  the  wave  number  k  =  2π/λ  =  ω/c  =  ω(μoεo)0.5,  (2.3.24).    The  associated  magnetic  field 
(2.3.25) is: 

- 256 -
 

H ( z, t  ) =  yˆ (	 Eo  η ) cos  (ωt − kz )  ⎡⎣Am-1 ⎤
⎦ 
o 

(9.1.2) 

This  unambiguously  defines  the  source,  and  the  boundary  is  similarly  unambigous:  σ  =  ∞  and 
therefore  E = 0   for z ≥ 0.  This more complete problem definition  is  sufficient  to yield a unique 
solution.  Often the first step in solving a problem is to ensure its definition is complete. 

Since  there  can  be  no  waves  inside  the  perfect  conductor,  and  since  the  source  field  alone 
does  not  satisfy  the  boundary  condition  E //  = 0   at  z  =  0,  one  or  more  additional  plane  waves 
must  be  superimposed  to  yield  a  valid  solution.    In  particular,  we  need  to  match  the  boundary 
condition  E //  = 0  at z = 0.  This can be done by adding a single uniform plane wave propagating 
in the -z direction with an electric field that cancels the incident electric field at z = 0 for all time 
t. 	 Thus we hypothesize that the total electric field is: 

E ( z, t  ) = xˆ ⎡⎣Eo cos  (ωt − kz  ) + E1 cos  (ωt + kz  + φ )⎤⎦ 

(9.1.3) 

where we have introduced the constants E1 and φ. 

In  Step  3  of  the method we must  solve  the  equation  (9.1.3)  that  characterizes  the  boundary 
value constraints: 

s ( ωt + + φ )⎤⎦ = 0
E ( 0, t  ) = xˆ ⎣⎡Eo cos  (ωt − 0 ) + E co
0 
1 

∴ E1 = −Eo  ,  φ = 0 

The result (9.1.5) yields the final trial solution: 

E ( z, t ) = xˆE [cos (ωt − kz ) − cos (ωt + kz )] = xˆ 2E  ( sin ωt ) sin kz

Note  that  the  sign  of  the  reflected  H   wave  is  reversed  from  that  of  the  reflected  E ,  consistent 
with  the  reversal  of  the  Poynting  vector  for  the  reflected  wave  alone.    We  have  used  the 
identities: 

cos α + cos β = 2 cos ⎡⎣( α + β )  2⎤⎦ cos ⎣⎡( α − β )  2 ⎤⎦	 

cos α − cos β = −2 sin ⎡⎣( α + β )  2⎤⎦ sin ⎡⎣( α − β )  2 ⎤⎦ 

(9.1.8) 

(9.1.9) 

Also note that  H ( z, t )  is 90o out of phase with  E ( z, t )  with respect to both time and space. 

- 257 -
 

	
	
We  also  need  a  trial  solution  for  z  >  0.    Inside  the  conductor  E H=  = 0 ,  and  boundary 
conditions (2.6.17) require a surface current: 

J = ×nˆ  HA ⎣⎡
s 

-1 ⎤
m ⎦ 

(9.1.10)

The  fourth  and  final  step  of  this  problem-solving  method  is  to  test  the  full  trial  solution 
against  all  of Maxwell’s  equations.  We  know  that  our  trial  solution  satisfies  the wave  equation 
in  our  source-free  region  because  our  solution  is  the  superposition  of waves  that  do;  it  therefore 
also  satisfies Faraday’s  and Ampere’s  laws  in  a  source-free  region,  as well  as Gauss’s  laws.   At 
the  perfectly  conducting  boundary  we  require  E //  = 0  and  H⊥ = 0 ;  these  constraints  are  also 
satisfied  by  our  trial  solution,  and  therefore  the  problem  is  solved  for  the  vacuum.    Zero-value 
fields  inside  the  conductor  satisfy  all  Maxwell’s  equations,  and  the  surface  current  Js   (9.1.10) 
satisfies the final boundary condition. 

The nature of  this solution  is  interesting.   Note  that  the  total electric field  is zero not only at 
the  surface  of  the  conductor,  but  also  at  a  series  of  null  planes  parallel  to  the  conductor  and 
spaced at intervals Δ along the z axis such that kznulls = -nπ, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...  That is, the null 
spacing  Δ =  π/k  =  λ/2,  where  λ  is  the  wavelength.    On  the  other  hand,  the  magnetic  field  is 
maximum  at  those  planes  where  E  is  zero  (the  null  planes  of  E),  and  has  nulls  where  E  is 
maximum.    Since  the  time  average  power  flow  and  the  Poynting  vector  are  clearly  zero  at  each 
of  these planes,  there  is no net power  flow  to  the  right.   Except at  the  field nulls, however,  there 
is  reactive power,  as discussed  in Section 2.7.3.   Because no average power  is  flowing via  these 
waves  and  the  energy  and  waves  are  approximately  stationary  in  space,  the  solution  is  called  a 
standing  wave,  as  illustrated  in  Figures  7.2.3  for  VSWR  and  7.4.1  for  resonance  on  perfectly 
reflecting TEM transmission lines.   

9.1.4  Reflection from transmissive boundaries 

Often  more  than  one  wave  must  be  added  to  the  given  incident  wave  to  satisfy  all  boundary 
conditions.  For  example,  assume  the  same  uniform  plane wave  (9.1.1–2)  in  vacuum  is  incident 
upon  the  same  planar  interface,  where  a  medium  having  μ,ε ≠ μo,εo  for  z  ≥ 0  has  replaced  the 
conductor.  We  have  no  reason  to  suspect  that  the  fields  beyond  the  interface  are  zero,  so  we 
might  try a  trial solution with both a  reflected wave Er(z,t) and a  transmitted wave Et(z,t) having 
unknown amplitudes (Er and Et) and phases (φ and θ) for which we can solve: 

E ( z, t ) = xˆ ⎣⎡Eo cos (ωt − kz ) + E r cos ( ωt + kz + φ )⎦⎤

Using  these  four  equations  to match  boundary  conditions  at  z  =  0  for  E //   and  H // ,  both  of 
which are continuous across an insulating boundary, and dividing by Eo, yields: 

xˆ ⎡⎣cos (

(9.1.16)

First we note that for these equations to be satisfied for all time t we must have φ = θ = 0, unless 
we reverse the signs of Er or Et and let φ or θ = π, respectively, which is equivalent. 

Dividing these two equations by cos ωt yields:

(9.1.20)

The  wave  transmission  coefficient  Et/Eo  follows  from  (9.1.17)  and  (9.1.19).  When  the 
characteristic  impedance ηt of  the dielectric  equals  that of  the  incident medium, ηo,  there  are no 
reflections  and  the  transmitted  wave  equals  the  incident  wave.    We  then  have  an  impedance 
match.  These  values  for  Er/Eo  and  Et/Eo  can  be  substituted  into  (9.1.11–14)  to  yield  the  final 
solution for  E ( z, t ) and  H ( z, t ) . 

The  last  step  of  the  four-step  method  for  solving  boundary  value  problems  involves 
checking this solution against all Maxwell’s equations—they are satisfied.

9.2  Waves incident on planar boundaries at angles 

9.2.1 

Introduction to waves propagating at angles 

To determine electromagnetic  fields we can generally solve a boundary value problem using  the 
method of Section 9.1.1,  the  first  step of which  involves characterization of  the basic quasistatic 
or  dynamic  fields  and  waves  that  could  potentially  exist  within  each  separate  region  of  the 
problem.   The  final solution  is a  linear combination of  these basic fields and waves  that matches 
all boundary conditions at the interfaces between the various regions. 

So  far  we  have  considered  only  waves  propagating  along  boundaries  or  normal  to  them. 
The  general  case  involves  waves  incident  upon  boundaries  at  arbitrary  angles,  so  we  seek  a 
compact  notation  characterizing  such  waves  that  simplifies  the  boundary  value  equations  and 
their  solutions.   Because wave  behavior  at  boundaries  often  becomes  frequency  dependent,  it  is 
convenient  to use  complex notation  as  introduced  in Section 2.3.2 and  reviewed  in Appendix B, 
which can explicitly  represent  the  frequency dependence of wave phenomena.   For example, we 
might  represent  the  electric  field  associated  with  a  uniform  plane  wave  propagating  in  the  +z 
direction as  E e− jkz 
, where:
o 

z  E e−
E ( ) =
o

jkz  = E e− j2 πz λ 
o 

Eo  = xˆEox

+ yˆ Eoy
 

 

(9.2.1)

(9.2.2)
 

This  notation  is  simpler  than  the  time  domain  representation.    For  example,  if  this  wave 
were x-polarized, then the compact complex notation  xˆE x  would be replaced in the time domain 
by: 

} = xˆR e {( R e [E x (z) ] + jI m [E x (z) ]) ( cos ωt + j sin ωt )} 
E ( )t  = R { xˆE  (z)e j
tω 
x 
e
= xˆ { R e [E x (z)] cos
 ] sin  ωt} 
 ωt − Im [E x (z)

(9.2.3) 

- 260 -
 

The more general time-domain expression including both x and y components would be twice as 
long.  Thus  complex  notation  adequately  characterizes  frequency-dependent  wave  propagation 
and is more compact. 

The  physical  significance  of  (9.2.1)  is  divided  into  two  parts:  E o   tells  us  the  polarization, 
amplitude, and absolute phase of  the wave at  the origin, and e-j2πz/λ ≡  ejφ(z)  tells us how  the phase 
φ of this wave varies with position.   In this case the phase decreases 2π radians as z increases by 
one  wavelength  λ.  The  physical  significance  of  a  phase  shift  φ  of  -2π  radians  for  z  =  λ  is  that 
observers located at z = λ experience a delay of 2π radians; for pure sinusoids a phase shift of 2π 
is of course not observable. 

Waves  propagating  in  arbitrary  directions  are  therefore  easily  represented  by  expressions 
similar  to  (9.2.1),  but  with  a  phase  φ  that  is  a  function  of  x,  y,  and  z.    For  example,  a  general 
plane wave would be: 

E ( )z  = Eoe − jk  x − jk  y − jk  z  = Eoe 
i 
− jk  r 
x 
y
z 

where  r = xˆx + yˆy + zˆz  and: 

k = xk
  ˆ 
ˆ x  + yk

 y  + zk
ˆ 

 z 

(9.2.4)

(9.2.5)

We call  k  the  propagation vector or wave number  k .  The wave numbers kx, ky, and kz have the 
dimensions  of  radians  per  meter  and  determine  how  rapidly  the  wave  phase  φ  varies  with 
position along  the x, y, and z axes,  respectively.   Positions having  the  same value  for  k • r  have 
the same phase and are  located on  the same phase  front.  A wave with a planar phase  fronts  is a 
plane wave, and if its amplitude is constant across any phase front, it is a uniform plane wave.

The  vector  k   points  in  the  direction  of  propagation  for  uniform  plane  waves.    The  geometry  is 
represented  in  Figure  9.2.1  for  a  uniform  plane wave  propagating  in  the  x-z  plane  at  an  angle  θ

k • r  must be constant everywhere in such a plane.

Three projected wavelengths, λx, λy, and λz, are perceived by observers moving along  those 
three  axes.  The  distance  between  successive  wavefronts  at  2π phase  intervals  is  λo  in  the 
direction  of  propagation,  and  the  distances  separating  these  same wavefronts  as measured  along 
the x and z axes are equal or greater, as illustrated in Figure 9.2.1.  For example:

One  difference  between  this  uniform  y-polarized  plane  wave  propagating  at  an  angle  and  one

9.2.2  Waves at planar dielectric boundaries 

Waves  at  planar  dielectric  boundaries  are  solved  using  the  boundary-value-problem  method  of 
Section 9.1.4 applied to waves propagating at angles, as introduced in Section 9.2.1.   

Because  the  behavior  of  waves  at  an  interface  depends  upon  their  polarization  we  need  a 
coordinate system  for characterizing  it.   For  this purpose  the plane of  incidence  is defined as  the

Figure 9.2.2  Uniform plane wave incident upon a planar interface. 

We  know  from  Section  2.3.4  that  any  pair  of  orthogonally  polarized  uniform  plane  waves 
can  be  superimposed  to  achieve  any  arbitrary  wave  polarization.    For  example,  x-  and  y-
polarized waves can be superimposed.   It  is customary  to recognize  two simple  types of  incident 

- 263 -
 

electromagnetic  waves  that  can  be  superimposed  to  yield  any  incident  wave  polarization: 
transverse  electric  waves  (TE  waves)  are  linearly  polarized  transverse  to  the  plane  of  incidence 
(y-polarized  in  the  figure),  and  transverse  magnetic  waves  (TM  waves)  have  the  orthogonal 
linear  polarization  so  that  the magnetic  field  is  purely  transverse  (again  if  y-polarized).   TE  and 
TM waves are typically transmitted and reflected with different amplitudes.   

Consider  first  a  TE  wave  incident  upon  the  planar  interface  of  Figure  9.2.2(b)  at  the 
incidence angle θi.  The corresponding  H  lies in the x-z plane and is orthogonal to  E .  H  points 
downward  in  the  figure,  corresponding  to  power  S = E × H  propagating  toward  the  interface, 
where  S   is  the  Poynting  vector  for  the  incident  wave.    The  wavelength  of  the  wave  above  the 
interface  is  λo  =  1/(f  με )   in  the  medium  characterized  by  permittivity  ε  and  permeability  μ. 
The medium  into which  the wave  is partially  transmitted  is  characterized by  εt  and μt,  and  there 
the wave has wavelength λt =  1/(f  μ ε  )  and  the same  frequency  f.   This  incident TE wave can

where  the characteristic  impedance of  the  incident medium  is η =  μ/ε  , and  H   is orthogonal  to 
E .  

The transmitted wave would generally be similar, but with a different ηt, θt, Et, and  k t .  We 
might  expect  a  reflected  wave  as  well.    The  boundary-value-problem  method  of  Section  9.1.2 
requires  expressions  for  all  waves  that  might  be  present  in  both  regions  of  this  problem.    In 
addition  to  the  incident  wave  we  therefore  might  add  general  expressions  for  reflected  and 
transmitted  waves  having  the  same  TE  polarization.    If  still  other  waves  were  needed  then  no 
solution satisfying all Maxwell’s equations would emerge until they were added too; we shall see 
no others are needed here.  These general reflected and transmitted waves are:

where  we  have  defined  the  normalized  angular  impedance  for  TE  waves  as  ηn'  ≡ 
ηtcosθi/(ηcosθt).  The  complex  angular  reflection  and  transmission  coefficients  Γ and  T  for  TE 
waves  approach  those  given  by  (9.1.19)  and  (9.1.20)  for  normal  incidence  in  the  limit  θi  → 0. 
The  limit  of  grazing  incidence  is  not  so  simple,  and  even  the  form  of  the  transmitted  wave  can 
change  markedly  if  it  becomes  evanescent,  as  discussed  in  the  next  section.    The  results  for

for  a  typical

equivalent  TEM  lines  for  which  the  characteristic  impedances  of  the  input  and  output  lines  are 
ηi/cosθi  and  ηt/cosθt,  respectively.  When  TM waves  are  incident,  the  corresponding  equivalent 
impedances are ηicosθi and ηtcosθt, respectively. 

Example 9.2B 
What  fraction of  the normally  incident power  (θi = 0)  is  reflected by a  single glass camera  lense 
having ε = 2.25εo?  If θi = 30o, what is θt in the glass? 

Solution: 	  At  each  interface  between  air  and  glass,  (9.2.28)  yields  for  θi  =  0:  ΓL  = 
0.5 
(ηn' - 1)/(ηn' + 1), where ηn' = (ηglasscosθ
i)/(ηaircosθt) = (εi/εg)
 = 1/1.5.  Thus ΓL = (1 
- 1.5)/(1  +  1.5)  =  -0.2,  and  |Γ|2  =  0.04,  so  ~4  percent  of  the  power  is  reflected  from 
each of  the  two curved surfaces  for each  independent  lense, or ~8 percent  total;  these 
reflections  are  incoherent  so  their  reflected  powers  add.    Modern  lenses  have  many 
elements  with  different  permittivities,  but  coatings  on  them  reduce  these  reflections, 
as  discussed  in  Section  7.3.2  for  quarter-wave  transformers.    Snell’s  law  (9.2.26)

9.2.3  Evanescent waves 

Figure 9.2.3 suggests why a special form of electromagnetic wave is sometimes required in order 
to  satisfy  boundary  conditions.    Figure  9.2.3(a)  illustrates  how  the  required  equality  of  the  z 
components  of  the  incident,  reflected,  and  transmitted  wave  propagation  vectors  k   controls  the 
angles  of  reflection  and  transmission,  θr  and  θt.  The  radii  of  the  two  semi-circles  correspond  to 
the magnitudes of  ki  and  k t . 

Figure  9.2.3(b)  shows  that  a  wave  incident  at  a  certain  critical  angle  θc  will  produce  a 
transmitted  wave  propagating  parallel  to  the  interface,  provided  k t  < k i .  Snell’s  law  (9.2.26) 
can be evaluated for sin θt = 1 to yield: 

θ = sin −1( ci

Figures 9.2.3(b)  illustrates why phase matching  is  impossible with uniform plane waves when θ

the  transmission medium  at  frequency ω.  A  non-uniform  plane wave  is  then  required  for  phase 
matching, as discussed below.

(9.2.34) 

This is the same expression as (9.2.19), which was obtained for normal incidence, except that the 
magnetic field and wave now decay with distance x from the interface rather than propagating in 
that direction.  Also, since sinθt > 1 for θi > θc, cosθt is now imaginary and positive, and  H  is not 
in  phase  with  E .
  As  a  result,  Poynting’s  vector  for  these  surface  waves  has  a  real  part 
corresponding  to  real  power  propagating  parallel  to  the  surface,  and  an  imaginary  part 
corresponding  to  reactive  power  flowing  perpendicular  to  the  surface  in  the  direction  of  wave

Since  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  S   are  orthogonal,  there  is  no  decay  in  the  direction  of 
propagation,  and  therefore  no  power  absorption  or  heating  of  the  media.    Beyond  the  critical 
angle  θc  the  power  is  perfectly  reflected.    In  the  next  section  we  shall  see  that  the  real  and 
imaginary parts of  S  are often neither orthogonal nor parallel. 

9.2.4  Waves in lossy media 

Sometimes  one  or  both  of  the  two  media  are  conductive.    This  section  explores  the  nature  of 
waves  propagating  in  such  lossy media  having  conductivity σ > 0.  Section  9.2.5  then  discusses 
reflections  from  such  media.    Losses  can  also  arise  if  ε  or  μ  are  complex.    The  quasistatic 
relaxation  of  charge,  current,  and  field  distributions  in  lossy  media  is  discussed  separately  in 
Section 4.3. 

We  can  determine  the  nature  of  waves  in  lossy  media  using  the  approach  of  Section  2.3.3 
and including the conduction currents  J  in Ampere’s law: 

∇ × H = J +  jωεE = σE +  jωεE =  jωεeff E 

where the effective complex permittivity  εeff  is: 

εeff  = ε ⎡⎣1  − ( jσ ωε )⎤⎦ 

(9.2.37) 

(9.2.38) 

The quantity σ/ωε  is  called  the  loss  tangent of  the medium  and  indicates how  fast waves decay. 
As we shall see, waves propagate well if σ << ωε, and decay rapidly if σ > ωε, sometimes within 
a fraction of a wavelength. 

 

Substituting  ε

eff  for ε in k  = ω με yields the dispersion relation:

This wave has wavelength λ′, frequency ω, and phase velocity vp inside the conductor related by:  


k '  = π λ ' =  ω 
2 
vp 

(9.2.42)


and the wave decays exponentially with z as e-k"z = e-z/Δ.   Note that the wave decays in the same 
direction as  it propagates, corresponding  to power dissipation, and  that  the 1/e penetration depth 
Δ is 1/k" meters.  Inside conductors, λ′ and vp are much less than their free-space values. 

We  now  need  to  determine  k'  and  k".    In  general, matching  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of 
(9.2.39) yields two equations that can be solved for k' and k":

(9.2.44) 

However, in the limits of very high or very low values of the loss tangent σ/ωε, it is much easier 
to evaluate (9.2.39) directly. 

In the low loss limit where σ << ωε, (9.2.39) yields:

where  the  approximate  wave  impedance  of  the  medium  is  η  =  μ/ε  ,  and  we  have  used  the 
Taylor  series approximation  1 + δ  ≅ 1 + δ/2  for δ << 1.  In  this  limit we  see  from  (9.2.45)  that 
λ′  and  vp  ≅  c  are  approximately  the  same  as  they  are  for  the  lossless  case,  and  that  the  1/e 
penetration depth Δ ≅ 2/ση, which becomes extremely large as σ → 0. 

In the high loss limit where σ >> ωε, (9.2.39) yields: 

k  = ω μ ε ⎡1 − σ( j  ωε )⎤ ≅ − j μωσ

The  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  k  have  the  same magnitudes,  and  the  choice  of  sign  determines 
the direction of propagation.  The wave generally decays exponentially as it propagates, although 
exponential  growth  occurs  in  media  with  negative  conductivity.    The  penetration  depth  is 
commonly called the skin depth δ in this limit (σ >> ωε), where: 

δ = 1 k

0.5 
''  ≅ ( 2 ωμσ ) 

[

(skin depth) 

(9.2.48) 

Because  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  k  are  equal  here,  both  the  skin  depth  and  the 
wavelength  λ'  inside  the  conductor  are  extremely  small  compared  to  the  free-space  wavelength 
λ; thus: 

λ =' 2π k ' = 2πδ  [m ]	

(wavelength in conductor) 

(9.2.49) 

These distances δ and λ' are extremely short in common metals such as copper (σ ≅ 5.8×107,  μ = 
μo) at frequencies such as 1 GHz, where δ ≅ 2×10-6  m and λ' ≅ 13×10-6  m, which are roughly five 
orders of magnitude smaller than the 30-cm free space wavelength.  The phase velocity vp of the 
wave is reduced by the same large factor. 

In the high conductivity limit, the wave impedance of the medium also becomes complex:

(9.2.50)

where  +j  is  consistent  with  a  decaying  wave  in  a  lossy  medium.    The  imaginary  part  of  η 
corresponds to power dissipation, and is non-zero whenever σ ≠ 0. 

Often  we  wish  to  shield  electronics  from  unwanted  external  radiation  that  could  introduce 
noise,  or  to  ensure  that  no  radiation  escapes  to  produce  radio  frequency  interference  (RFI)  that 
affects  other  systems.    Although  the  skin  depth  effect  shields  electromagnetic  radiation,  high 
conductivity  will  reflect  most  incident  radiation  in  any  event.    Conductors  generally  provide 
good  shielding  at  higher  frequencies  for  which  the  time  intervals  are  short  compared  to  the 
magnetic  relaxation  time  (4.3.15)  while  remaining  long  compared  to  the  charge  relaxation  time 
(4.3.3);  Section  4.3.2  and  Example  4.3B  present  examples  of  magnetic  field  diffusion  into 
conductors. 

Example 9.2C 
A uniform plane wave propagates at frequency f = c/λ = 1 MHz in a medium characterized by εo, 
μo, and conductivity σ.  If σ ≅ 10-3ωεo, over what distance D would the wave amplitude decay by 
a factor of 1/e?  What would be the 1/e wave penetration depth δ in a good conductor having σ ≅ 
1011ωε at this frequency? 

Solution: 	  In  the  low-loss  limit  where  σ  <<  ωε,  k  ≅ ω/c  -  jση/2  (9.2.45),  so  E  ∝  e-σηz/2  =  e-z/D 
where D = 2/ση = 2(εo/μo)0.5/10-3ωεo = 2000c/ω ≅ 318λ  [m].    In  the high-loss  limit k

λ/2π ≅ 7.1×10-7λ = 0.21 mm.   This conductivity corresponds  to  typical metal and  the 
resulting penetration depth is a tiny fraction of a free-space wavelength. 

9.2.5  Waves incident upon good conductors 

This  section  focuses  primarily  on  waves  propagating  inside  good  conductors.    The  field 
distributions produced outside good conductors by  the superposition of waves  incident upon and 
reflected from them are discussed in Section 9.2.3. 

Section 9.2.4 showed that uniform plane waves in lossy conductors decay as they propagate. 
The wave propagation constant k is then complex in order to characterize exponential decay with 
distance: 

k = −k '  jk "

 

The form of a uniform plane wave in lossy media is therefore: 

E ( )r  = yˆ E oe− jk ' z − k " z  ⎡⎣ v m-1 ⎤⎦

(9.2.51)

(9.2.52) 

When  a  plane wave  impacts  a  conducting  surface  at  an  angle,  a  complex wave  propagation 
vector  k t   is  required  to  represent  the  resulting  transmitted wave.    The  real  and  imaginary  parts 
of  k t  are generally at some angle to each other.  The result is a non-uniform plane wave because 
its intensity is non-uniform across each phase front. 

To  illustrate  how  such  transmitted  non-uniform  plane waves  can  be  found,  consider  a  lossy 
transmission medium  characterized by  ε, σ,  and μ, where we  can  combine  ε and σ into  a  single 
effective complex permittivity, as done in (9.2.38)48: 

εeff  ≡ ε ( − σ ω

If  we  represent  the  electric  field  as  E
  and  substitute  it  into  the  wave  equation 
(∇ +2 ω2με ) E = 0 , we obtain  for non-zero  E   the general dispersion  relation  for plane waves  in 
isotropic lossy media:

Once  a  plane  of  incidence  such  as  the  x-z  plane  is  defined,  this  relation  has  four  scalar 
unknowns—the real and imaginary parts for each of the x and z (in-plane) components of  k .  At 
a planar boundary  there are four such unknowns for each of  the reflected and  transmitted waves, 
or  a  total  of  eight  unknowns.  Each  of  these  four  components  of  k   (real  and  imaginary,  parallel 
and  perpendicular)  must  satisfy  a  boundary  condition,  yielding  four  equations.   The  dispersion 
relation  (9.2.55)  has  real  and  imaginary  parts  for  each  side  of  the  boundary,  thus  providing  four 
more  equations.  The  resulting  set  of  eight  equations  can  be  solved  for  the  eight  unknowns,  and 
generally  lead  to  real  and  imaginary  parts  for  k t   that  are  neither  parallel  nor  perpendicular  to 
each other or to the boundary.  That is, the real and imaginary parts of  k  and  S  can point in four 
different directions. 

It is useful to consider the special case of reflections from planar conductors for which σ >> 
ωε. 
In  this  limit  the  solution  is  simple  because  the  transmitted  wave  inside  the  conductor 
propagates  almost  perpendicular  to  the  interface,  which  can  be  shown  as  follows.    Equation 
(9.2.47) gave the propagation constant k for a uniform plane wave in a medium with σ >> ωε: 

k ≅ ±

ωμσ

(1 − j) 

(9.2.56) 

The  real  part  of  such  a  k   is  so  large  that  even  for  grazing  angles  of  incidence,  θi  ≅ 90o,  the 
transmission  angle  θt  must  be  nearly  zero  in  order  to  match  phases,  as  suggested  by  Figure 
9.2.3(a)  in  the  limit  where  kt  is  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  ki.    As  a  result,  the  power 
dissipated  in  the  conductor  is  essentially  the  same  as  for  θ =  0o
,  and  therefore  depends  in  a 
i 
simple way on the induced surface current and parallel surface magnetic field  H // .  H //  is simply 
twice that associated with the incident wave alone  ( H⊥ ≅ 0 ) ; essentially all the incident power is 
reflected so  the  incident and  reflected waves have  the same amplitudes and  their magnetic  fields 
add. 

The  power  density  Pd  [W  m-2]  dissipated  by  waves  traveling  in  the  +z  direction  in 
conductors with an interface at z = 0 can be found using the Poynting vector:

(9.2.61)

The  significance  of  this  result  is  that  it  simplifies  calculation  of  power  dissipated  when  waves 
impact  conductors—we  need  only  evaluate  the  surface magnetic  field  under  the  assumption  the 
conductor is perfect, and then use (9.2.61) to compute the power dissipated per square meter. 

Example 9.2D 
What  fraction  of  the  10-GHz  power  reflected  by  a  satellite  dish  antenna  is  resistively  dissipated 
in  the metal  if σ = 5×107 Siemens per meter?   Assume normal  incidence.   A wire of diameter D 
and  made  of  the  same  metal  carries  a  current  I.  What  is  the  approximate  power  dissipated  per 
meter  if  the  skin  depth  δ  at  the  chosen  frequency  is  much  greater  than  D?    What  is  this 
dissipation if δ << D?

9.2.6  Duality and TM waves at dielectric boundaries 

Transverse magnetic  (TM) waves  reflect  from  planar  surfaces  just  as  do  TE waves,  except with 
different  amplitudes  as  a  function  of  angle.    The  angles  of  reflection  and  transmission  are  the 

- 274 ­

same  as  for  TE  waves,  however,  because  both  TE  and  TM  waves  must  satisfy  the  same  phase 
matching boundary condition (9.2.25). 

The  behavior  of  TE  waves  at  planar  boundaries  is  characterized  by  equations  (9.2.14)  and 
(9.2.15) for the incident electric and magnetic fields, (9.2.16) and (9.2.17) for the reflected wave, 
and (9.2.18) and (9.2.19) for the transmitted wave, supplemented by expressions for the complex 
reflection and transmission coefficients Γ = Er/Eo, (9.2.28), and T = Et/Eo, (9.2.29).  Although the 
analogous  behavior  of  TM  waves  could  be  derived  using  the  same  boundary-value  problem 
solving method used in Section 9.2.2 for TE waves, the principle of duality can provide the same 
solutions with much less effort. 

Duality  works  because  Maxwell’s  equations  without  charges  or  currents  are  duals  of 
themselves.    That  is,  by  transforming  E ⇒ H ,  H ⇒ −E ,  and  ε ⇔ μ,  the  set  of  Maxwell’s 
equations is unchanged: 

∇ × E = −μ∂

H  ∂t 

∇ × H = ε∂E ∂t

(9.2.63) 

(9.2.64)
 

(9.2.65)
 

The  transformed  set of equations on  the  right-hand  side of  (9.2.62)  to  (9.2.65)  is  the same as  the 
original, although sequenced differently.  As a result, any solution to Maxwell’s equations is also 
a  solution  to  the  dual  problem  where  the  variables  and  boundary  conditions  are  all  transformed 
as indicated above. 

The  boundary  conditions  derived  in  Section  2.6  for  a  planar  interface  between  two 
insulating  uncharged  media  are  that  E // ,  H // ,  μH⊥ ,  and  εE⊥   be  continuous  across  the 
boundary. Since the duality transformation leaves these boundary conditions unchanged, they are 
dual  too.  However,  duality  cannot  be  used,  for  example,  in  the  presence  of  perfect  conductors 
that force  E //  to zero, but not  H // .

Figure  9.2.5(b)  illustrates  a  TM  plane  wave  incident  upon  a  planar  boundary  where  both  the 
wave and the boundary conditions are dual to the TE wave illustrated in (a). 

The behavior of TM waves at planar boundaries between non-conducting media is therefore 
characterized  by  duality  transformations  of  Equations  (9.2.62–65)  for  TE  waves,  supplemented 
by  similar  transformations  of  the  expressions  for  the  complex  reflection  and  transmission 
coefficients  Γ =  Er/Eo,  (9.2.28),  and  T  =  Et/Eo,  (9.2.29).  After  the  transformations  E ⇒ H ,

Figure 9.2.6  Power reflected from planar dielectric interfaces for μ = μt. 

Figure  9.2.6  reveals  an  important  phenomenon—there  is  perfect  transmission  at  Brewster’s 
angle  θB  for  one  of  the  two  polarizations.    In  this  case  Brewster’s  angle  occurs  for  the  TM 
polarization  because  μ  is  the  same  everywhere  and  ε is  not,  and  it  would  occur  for  TE 
polarization if μ varied across the boundary while ε did not.  This phenomenon is widely used in 
glass  Brewster-angle windows when  even  the  slightest  reflection must  be  avoided  or when  pure 
linear polarization is required (the reflected wave is pure). 

We  can  compute  θB  by  noting  Hr/Ho  and,  using  (9.2.72),  ηn  =  1.   If  μ =  μt,  then  (9.2.74) 
yields  ε 0.5 
sin  θi  =  ε 0.5 
0.5 
i  =  ε0.5  cos  θt.  Snell’s  law  for  μ =  μt  yields  ε
sin  θt.  These  two 
cos  θ
t
t
equations are satisfied  if sin θi = cos θt and cos θi =  sin θt.  Dividing  this  form of Snell’s  law by 
0.5
[cos θi = sin θ
t] yields: tan θi = (εt/εi)
, or: 

θ = tan −1 
B 

ε t  εi 

(9.2.75) 

Moreover, dividing [sin θi = cos θt] by [cos θi = sin θt] yields tan θB = cos θt, which implies θB + 
θt  =  90°.  Using  this  equation  it  is  easy  to  show  that  θB  >  45o  for  interfaces  where  θt  <  θi,  and 
o 
when θt > θi, it follows that θ
B < 45  . 

One  way  to  physically  interpret  Brewster’s  angle  for  TM  waves  is  to  note  that  at  θB  the 
polar  axes  of  the  electric  dipoles  induced  in  the  second  dielectric  εt  are  pointed  exactly  at  the 
angle  of  reflection  mandated  by  phase  matching,  but  dipoles  radiate  nothing  along  their  polar 
axis;  Figure  9.2.6(b)  illustrates  the  geometry.    That  is,  θB  +  θt  =  90o.    For  magnetic  media 

- 277 -
 

magnetic  dipoles  are  induced,  and  for TE waves  their  axes  point  in  the  direction  of  reflection  at 
Brewster’s angle. 

Yet another way  to physically  interpret Brewster’s angle  is  to note  that perfect  transmission 
can  be  achieved  if  the  boundary  conditions  can  be  matched  without  invoking  a  reflected  wave. 
This  requires  existence  of  a  pair  of  incidence  and  transmission  angles  θi  and  θt  such  that  the 
parallel  components  of  both  E   and  H   for  these  two waves match  across  the  boundary.    Such  a 
pair  consistent with  Snell’s  law  always  exists  for TM waves  at  planar  dielectric  boundaries,  but 
not for TE waves.  Thus there is perfect impedance matching at Brewster’s angle. 

Example 9.2E 
What  is  Brewster’s  angle  θB  if  μ2  =  4μ1,  and  ε2  =  ε1,  and  for  which  polarization  would  the 
phenomenon be observed? 

Solution: 	  If  the  permeabilities  differ,  but  not  the  permittivities,  then  Brewster’s  angle  is 
observed  only  for  TE  waves.  At  Brewster’s  angle  θB + θ t  = 90° ,  and  Snell’s  law 
sin θ 
μ 
t	  = 
.  But  sin θ t  = sin (	 90 ° − θB ) = cos θB ,  so  Snell’s  law  becomes:

9.3  Waves guided within Cartesian boundaries 

9.3.1 

Parallel-plate waveguides
 

We  have  seen  in  Section  9.2  that  waves  can  be  reflected  at  planar  interfaces.    For  example,  
 
(9.2.14)  and  (9.2.16)  describe  the  electric  fields  for  a TE wave  reflected  from  a  planar  interface 
at x = 0, and are repeated here: 

E  =  yˆ E  e jk x x − jk z z  ⎣⎡V m

Note  that  the  subscripts  i  and  r  denote  “incident”  and  “reflected”,  not  “imaginary”  and  “real”. 
These equations satisfy  the phase-matching boundary condition  that kz = kzi = kzr.  Therefore  |kx| 
z = ω2με. 
is the same for the incident and reflected waves because for both waves k  2

If  the  planar  interface  at  x  =  0  is  a  perfect  conductor,  then  the  total  electric  field  there 
parallel  to  the  conductor  must  be  zero,  implying  E r  = −Eo .  The  superposition  of  these  two 
incident and reflected waves is:

(9.3.4)

Because  kx  =  2π/λx,  these  planes  of  electric-field  nulls  are  located  at  xnulls  =  nλx/2.  A  second 
perfect  conductor  could  be  inserted  at  any  one  of  these  x  planes  so  that  the waves would  reflect 
back  and  forth  and  propagate  together  in  the  +z  direction,  trapped  between  the  two  conducting 
planes. 

We  can  easily  confirm  that  the  boundary  conditions  are  satisfied  for  the  corresponding 
magnetic field  H ( x , z )  by using Faraday’s law:

waveguides  that  relates  mode  number  to  waveguide  dimensions;  d  is  the  separation  of  the 
parallel  plates.  We  can  use  this  guidance  condition  to make  the  expressions  (9.3.3)  and  (9.3.5) 
for  E  and  H  more explicit by replacing kxx with nπx/d, and kz with 2π/λz:

* 
The direction of propagation  can be  inferred  from  the Poynting vector  S = E × H  .  Because  this 
is  a  TE wave  and  there  is  only  one  half wavelength  between  the  two  conducting  plates  (n  =  1), 
this is designated the TE1 mode of a parallel-plate waveguide.  Because Maxwell’s equations are 
linear, several propagating modes with different values of n can be active simultaneously and be 
superimposed. 

These  fields are periodic  in both  the x and z directions.   The wavelength λz along  the z axis

and magnetic fields are 90 degrees out of phase everywhere and decay exponentially toward zero

Figure 9.3.3  Evanescent TE1 mode in a parallel-plate waveguide. 

If  we  reflect  a  TM  wave  from  a  perfect  conductor  there  again  will  be  planar  loci  where 
additional perfectly  conducting plates  could be placed without violating boundary conditions, as 
suggested  in Figure  9.3.1(b)  for  the TM1 mode.   Note  that  the  field  configuration  is  the  same  as 
for  the TE1 mode,  except  that  E   and  H  have been  interchanged  (allowed by duality)  and phase 
shifted in the lateral direction to match boundary conditions.  Between the plates the TE and TM 
field solutions are dual, as discussed in Section 9.2.6.  Also note that TEM = TM01. 

Evaluation of Poynting’s vector reveals that the waves in Figure 9.3.1 are propagating to the 
right.  If  this  waveguide  mode  were  superimposed  with  an  equal-strength  wave  traveling  to  the 
left,  the  resulting  field pattern would be  similar,  but  the magnetic  and  electric  field distributions 
E ( t )  and  H ( )t  would be shifted relative to one another by λz/4 along the z axis, and they would 
be 90o out of phase  in  time;  the  time-average power  flow would be zero, and  the  reactive power 
Im{S} would  alternate  between  inductive  (+j)  and  capacitive  (-j)  at  intervals  of  λz/2  down  the 
waveguide. 

Because kz/ω is frequency dependent, the shapes of waveforms evolve as they propagate.  If 
 
the  signal  is narrowband,  this  evolution  can be characterized  simply  by  noting  that  the  envelope 
of the waveform propagates at the “group velocity” vg, and the modulated sinusoidal wave inside 
the  envelope  propagates  at  the  “phase  velocity”  vp,  as  discussed  more  fully  in  Section  9.5.2. 
These velocities are easily found from k(ω): vp = ω/k and vg = (∂k/∂ω)-1.

The  phase  velocity  vp  of  a  wave,  which  is  the  velocity  at  which  the  field  distribution 
pictured  in  Figure  9.3.1  moves  to  the  right,  equals  ω/k,  which  approaches  infinity  as  ω 
approaches  the  cut-off  frequency ωTEn  from above.   The group velocity vg, which  is  the velocity 
of  energy  or  information  propagation,  equals  dω/dk,  which  is  the  local  slope  of  the  dispersion 
relation ω(k) and can never exceed c.  Both vp and vg approach c = (με)-0.5 as ω → ∞. 

Example 9.3A 
A  TM2  mode  is  propagating  in  the  +z  direction  in  a  parallel-plate  waveguide  with  plate 
separation d and free-space wavelength λo.  What are  E  and  H ?  What is λz?  What is the decay 
length α -1 
z  when the mode is evanescent and λo = 2λcut off? 

Solution:  We can  superimpose  incident and  reflected TM waves or use duality  to yield  H (x,y) 
=  yˆ Hocoskxx  e − jk z z  ,  analogous  to  (9.3.3),  where  kxd  =  2π  for  the  TM2  mode.

9.3.2  Rectangular waveguides 

Waves  can  be  trapped  within  conducting  cylinders  and  propagate  along  their  axis,  rectangular 
and  cylindrical  waveguides  being  the  most  common  examples.    Consider  the  rectangular 
waveguide illustrated in Figure 9.3.5.  The fields inside it must satisfy the wave equation:

Since  the  wave  equation  requires  that  the  second  spatial  derivative  of  E   or  H   equal  E   or 
H times  a  constant,  these  fields must  be  products of  sinusoids  or  exponentials  along  each  of  the 
three  cartesian  coordinates,  or  sums  of  such  products.    For  example,  the  wave  equation  and

We  can  already  compute  the  cut-off  frequency of propagation ωmn  for  each mode,  assuming 
our  conjectured  solutions  are  valid,  as  shown  below.    Cut-off  occurs  when  a  mode  becomes 
evanescent, i.e., when k  2 
o  equals zero or becomes negative.  At cut-off for the m,n mode:

(9.3.22) 

Since  a  ≥  b  by  definition,  and  the  0,0  mode  cannot  have  non-zero  fields,  as  shown  later,  the 
lowest frequency that can propagate is: 

ω = πc a  
10 

(9.3.23)

which  implies  that  the  longest  wavelength  that  can  propagate  in  rectangular  waveguide  is 
λmax  =  2πc/ω10  =  2a.  If  a  >  2b,  the  second  lowest  cut-off  frequency  is  ω20  =  2ω10,  so  such 
waveguides  can  propagate  only  a  single  mode  over  no  more  than  an  octave  (factor  of  2  in 
frequency) before another propagating mode  is added.   The parallel-plate waveguides of Section 
9.3.1 exhibited similar properties. 

Returning  to  the  field  solutions,  E   must  also  satisfy  Gauss’s  law,  ∇ • εE = 0 ,  within  the 
waveguide, where ε is constant and Ez  ≡ 0 for TE waves.  This implies: 

 ( A cos k
∇ • E = 0 = ∂E  ∂x + ∂E y  ∂y   + ∂E  z

A C= = 0 

k Dy  = −k x B

E = ( Eo  k o ) ( xˆk y sin k  y y cos k x

where  the  factor  of  k  -1 
o   was  introduced  so  that  Eo   would  have  its  usual  units  of  volts/meter. 
Note  that  since  kx  =  ky  =  0  for  the  TE00 mode,  E = 0   everywhere  and  this mode  does  not  exist. 
The corresponding magnetic field follows from  H = − ∇( × E ) jωμ :

(9.3.28) 

A  similar  procedure  yields  the  fields  for  the  TM modes;  their  form  is  similar  to  the  TE  modes, 
but  with  E   and  H   interchanged  and  then  shifted  spatially  to  match  boundary  conditions.    The 
validity  of  field  solutions  where E   and  H   are  interchanged  also  follows  from  the  principle  of 
duality, discussed in Section 9.2.6. 

The most widely used rectangular waveguide mode is TE10, often called the dominant mode, 
where  the  first  digit  corresponds  to  the  number  of  half-wavelengths  along  the  wider  side  of  the 
guide  and  the  second  digit  applies  to  the  narrower  side.    For  this mode  the  guidance  conditions 
yield  kx  =  0  and  ky  =  π/a,  where  a  ≥  b  by  convention.  Thus  the  fields  (9.3.27)  and  (9.3.28) 
become:

(9.3.30) 

The fields for this mode are roughly sketched in Figure 9.3.5 for a wave propagating in the plus-
z  direction.  The  electric  field  varies  as  the  sine  across  the  width  a,  and  is  uniform  across  the 
height b of  the guide; at any  instant  it also varies sinusoidally along z.   Hy varies as  the sine of y 
across  the  width  b,  while  Hx  varies  as  the  cosine;  both  are  uniform  in  x  and  vary  sinusoidally 
along z. 

The  forms  of  evanescent  modes  are  easily  found.    For  example,  the  electric  and  magnetic 
fields  given  by  (9.3.29)  and  (9.3.30)  still  apply  even  if  k   =  (k 2  -  k 2  -  k 2)0.5

The  main  differences  are  that  for  the  evanescent  wave:  1)  the  field  distribution  at  the  origin 
simply  decays  exponentially  with  distance  z  and  the  fields  lose  their  wave  character  since  they 
wax  and wane  in  synchrony  at  all  positions,  2)  the  electric  and magnetic  fields  vary  90  degrees 
out  of  phase  so  that  the  total  energy  storage  alternates  twice  per  cycle  between  being  purely 
electric and purely magnetic, and 3)  the energy flux becomes purely reactive since the real (time 
average) power flow is zero.  The same differences apply to any evanscent TEmn or TMmn mode.

Example 9.3B 
What  modes  have  the  four  lowest  cutoff  frequencies  for  a  rectangular  waveguide  having  the 
dimensions  a  =  1.2b?   For  the  TE10  mode,  where  can  we  cut  thin  slots  in  the  waveguide  walls 
such that they transect no currents and thus have no deleterious effect? 

Solution:	  The cut-off frequencies (9.3.22) are: ω  = [(mπc/a)2 + (nπc/b)2 0.5
, so the lowest cut­
]
mn
off  is  for TEmn = TE10,  since TE00, TM00, TM01,  and TM10  do  not  exist.  Next  comes 
TE11  and  TM11,  followed  by  TE20.  The wall  currents  are  perpendicular  to⎯H, which 
has no x component for the dominant mode (9.3.30); see Figure 9.3.5.  Therefore thin 
slots  cut  in  the  x  direction  in  the  sidewalls  (y  =  0,a)  will  never  transect  current  or 
perturb  the  TE10  mode.    In  addition,  the  figure  and  (9.3.30)  show  that  the  z-directed 
currents  at  the  center  of  the  top  and  bottom  walls  are  also  always  zero,  so  thin  z-
directed  slots  at  those midlines  do  not  perturb  the TE10 mode  either.    Small  antennas 
placed  through  thin  slots  or  holes  in  such  waveguides  are  sometimes  used  to 
introduce or extract signals. 

9.3.3  Excitation of waveguide modes 

Energy  can  be  radiated  inside  waveguides  and  resonators  by  antennas.    We  can  compute  the 
energy  radiated  into  each  waveguide  or  resonator  mode  using  modal  expansions  for  the  fields 
and matching the boundary conditions imposed by the given source current distribution  J . 

 
Consider  a waveguide  of  cross-section  a×b  and  uniform  in  the  z  direction, where  a  ≥  b.    If  
we  assume  the  source  current  J s   is  confined  at  z =  0  to  a wire  or  current  sheet  in  the  x,y  plane, 
then  the  associated magnetic  fields  H +   and  H −   at  z  =  0  ± δ  ,  respectively  (δ→0), must  satisfy 
the boundary condition (2.1.11): 

H + − H − = J s × zˆ	 

(9.3.33) 

Symmetry dictates  H − (x ,y  ) = −H + (x ,y  )  for  the x-y components of  the  fields on  the  two sides of 
the boundary at z = 0, assuming there are no other sources present, so: 

zˆ × (H+ − H− ) = zˆ × (Js × zˆ) = Js  = 2 zˆ × H+ (x ,y
)	 

 

(9.3.34) 

To  illustrate  the method we  restrict  ourselves  to  the  simple  case  of TEm,0 modes,  for which 
E  and  J s  are  in  the x direction.  The  total magnetic field (9.3.28) summed over all TEm,0 modes 
and orthogonal to  zˆ  for forward propagating waves is:

(9.3.35)

where  Em  is  the  complex  amplitude  of  the  electric  field  for  the  TEm,0  mode,  and  ky  has  been 
replaced by mπ/a.  We can multiply both right-hand sides of (9.3.35) by sin(nπy/a) and  integrate 
over the x-y plane to find:

= 0.5(cid:119)∫∫  Js ( x , y ) sin ( nπy a )  dx dy

)  dx dy

(9.3.36) 

Because  sine  waves  of  different  frequencies  are  orthogonal  when  integrated  over  an  integral 
number  of  half-wavelengths  at  each  frequency,  the  integral  on  the  left-hand  side  is  zero  unless 
m  =  n.  Therefore  we  have  a  simple  way  to  evaluate  the  phase  and  magnitude  of  each  excited 
mode: 

E

⎦ ∫∫Js (x ,y )sin (nπy a

⎣

(9.3.37)

Not  all  excited  modes  propagate  real  power,  however.    Modes  n  with  cutoff  frequencies 
-  (nπ/a)2]0.5  is  imaginary.    The  associated  magnetic  field 
above  ω  are  evanescent,  so  kzn  =  [k 2 
o
remains in phase with Js and real, and therefore the power in each evanescent wave is imaginary. 
Since  all modes  are  orthogonal  in  space,  their  powers  add;  for  evanescent modes  the  imaginary 
power  corresponds  to  net  stored  magnetic  or  electric  energy.    The  reactance  at  the  input  to  the 
wires driving  the  current  Js  is  therefore  either  capacitive or  inductive, depending on whether  the 
total energy stored in the reactive modes is predominantly electric or magnetic, respectively. 

A  more  intuitive  way  to  understand  modal  excitation  is  to  recognize  that  the  power  P 
delivered to the waveguide by a current distribution  J s  is:  

[
]V

 
 

 

* 
E • Js  dv

P = (cid:120)∫∫∫ 
V 
and therefore any mode for which the field distribution  E  is orthogonal to  J s  will not be excited, 
and  vice  versa.  For  example,  a  straight  wire  in  the  x  direction  across  a  waveguide  carrying 
current  at  some  frequency  ω will  excite  all  TEn0 modes  that  have  non-zero  E   at  the  position  of 
the  wire;  modes  with  cutoff  frequencies  above  ω  will  contribute  only  reactance  to  the  current 
source,  while  the  propagating  modes  will  contribute  a  real  part.    Proper  design  of  the  current 
distribution  J s  can permit any combination of modes to be excited, while not exciting the rest.

Cavity resonators 

9.4.1  Rectangular cavity resonators 

Rectangular cavity resonators are hollow  rectangular conducting boxes of width a, height b, and 
length  d,  where  d  ≥ a  ≥ b  by  convention.  Since  they  are  simply  rectangular  waveguides 
terminated  at  both  ends  by  conducting  walls,  and  the  electric  fields  must  still  obey  the  wave 
equation,  ( ∇2 +  ω2με) E = 0 ,  therefore  E   for  TE  modes  must  have  the  form  of  the  TE 
waveguide  fields  (9.3.27),  but  with  a  sinusoidal  z  dependence  that  matches  the  boundary 
conditions  at  z  =  0  and  z  =  d;  for  example,  equal  forward-  and  backward-propagating  waves 
would form the standing wave: 

E = ( E o  k o ) ( xˆ k ysink y ycosk x x - yˆ k x sink x xcosk y y ) ( Asink z z + Bcosk z z ) 

(9.4.1)

Unlike  rectangular  waveguides  that  propagate  any  frequency  above  cut-off  for  the  spatial 
field  distribution  (mode)  of  interest,  cavity  resonators  operate  only  at  specific  resonant 
frequencies  or  combinations  of  them  in  order  to  match  all  boundary  conditions.    The  resonant 
frequencies ωmnp for a rectangular cavity resonator follow from the dispersion relation:

The fundamental mode for a cavity resonator is the lowest frequency mode.  Since boundary 
conditions  can  not  be met  unless  at  least  two  of  the  quantum  numbers m,  n,  and  p  are  non-zero, 
the  lowest resonant frequency  is associated with  the  two  longest dimensions, d and a.  Therefore

The  total  energy  w  [J]  =  we(t)  +  wm(t)  in  each  mode  m,n,p  of  a  cavity  resonator  can  be

Perturbation of resonator frequencies 

Often  we  would  like  to  tune  a  resonance  to  some  nearby  frequency.    This  can  generally  be 
accomplished by changing the shape of the resonator slightly.  Although the relationship between 
shape  and  resonant  frequency  can  be  evaluated  using Maxwell’s  equations,  a  simpler  and  more 
physical approach is taken here. 

The  energy  stored  in  a  resonator  can  be  regarded  as  a  population  of  N  trapped  photons  at 
frequency f bouncing about inside.  Since the energy E per photon is hf (1.1.10), the total energy 
in the resonator is: 

w T  = NhJf

[ ]  	 
 

(9.4.9)
 

- 289 -
 

If we  force  the walls  of  a  resonator  to move  slowly  toward  its new  shape,  they will move  either 
opposite  to  the forces  imposed by  the electromagnetic fields  inside, or  in  the same direction, and 
thereby do positive or negative work,  respectively, on  those  fields.    If we do positive work,  then 
the  total  electromagnetic  energy  wT  must  increase.    Since  the  number  of  photons  remains 
constant  if  the  shape  change  is  slow  compared  to  the  frequency,  positive  work  on  the  fields 
results  in  increased  electromagnetic  energy  and  frequency  f.    If  the  resonator walls move  in  the 
direction  of  the  applied  electromagnetic  forces,  the  externally  applied  work  on  the  fields  is 
negative and the energy and resonant frequency decrease. 

The  paradigm  above  leads  to  a  simple  expression  for  the  change  in  resonant  frequency  of 
any resonator due to small physical changes.  Consider the case of an air-filled metallic cavity of 
any  shape  that  is  perturbed  by  pushing  in  or  out  the  walls  slightly  in  one  or  more  places.    The 
electromagnetic  force on a conductor has components associated with both  the attractive electric 
and repulsive magnetic pressures on conductors given by (4.1.15) and (4.1.23), respectively.  For 
sinusoidal waves these pressures are:

(electric pressure) 

(9.4.10)

(magnetic pressure) 

(9.4.11)

But  these  pressures,  except  for  the  negative  sign  of  Pe  (corresponding  to  attraction),  are  the 
electric and magnetic energy densities [J m-3].

 
The work Δw done in moving the cavity boundary slightly is the pressure Pe/m applied, times 
the  area  over  which  it  is  applied,  times  the  distance moved  perpendicular  to  the  boundary.    For 
example, Δw equals the inward electromagnetic pressure (± energy density) times the increase in 
volume added by  the moving boundary.   But  this  increase  in  total  stored electromagnetic energy 
is simply: 

Δw T  = Nh

 Δf  = −(Pe + Pm )Δvolume

= Δw e − Δw m 
 

(9.4.12) 

The  signs  for  the  increases  in  electric  and magnetic  energy  storage  Δwe  and  Δwm  and  pressures 
Pe  and  Pm  are  different  because  the  pressures  Pe  and  Pm  are  in  opposite  directions, where Δwe = 
WeΔvol,  and  Δwm  =  -PmΔvol  =  -WmΔvol.  Δwe  is  defined  as  the  electric  energy  stored  in  the 
increased volume of  the cavity, Δvol, assuming  the electric  field strength  remains constant as  the 
wall moves slightly; Δwm  is defined similarly.   The main  restriction here  is  that  the walls cannot 
be moved so  far  that  the  force density on  the walls changes, nor can  their shape change abruptly 
for  the  same  reason.  For  example,  a  sharp  point  concentrates  electric  fields  and  would  violate 
this constraint. 

Dividing (9.4.12) by wT = Nhf yields the frequency perturbation equation:

(9.4.13)

A  simple  example  illustrates  its  use.    Consider  a  rectangular  cavity  resonator  operating  in 
the TE101 mode with the fields given by (5.4.37) and (5.4.38).  If we push in the center of the top 
or bottom of  the cavity where  H ≅ 0  and  E ≠ 0  we are reducing  the volume allocated  to electric 
energy  storage,  so Δwe  is negative  and  the  resonant  frequency will drop  in  accord with  (9.4.13). 
If  we  push  in  the  sides,  however,  the  resonant  frequency  will  increase  because  we  are  reducing 
the  volume where magnetic  energy  is  stored  and Δwm  is  negative;  the  electric  energy  density  at 
the  sidewalls  is  zero.  In  physical  terms,  pushing  in  the  top  center  where  the  electric  fields  pull 
inward on the wall means that those fields are doing work on the moving wall and therefore lose 
energy  and  frequency.  Pushing  in where  the magnetic  fields  are pushing outward does work on 
the  fields,  increasing  their  energy  and  frequency.    This  technique  can  be  used  to  determine 
experimentally the unknown resonant mode of a cavity as well as tuning it. 

9.5  Waves in complex media 

9.5.1  Waves in anisotropic media 

There  are  many  types  of  media  that  can  be  analyzed  simply  using  Maxwell’s  equations,  which 
characterize  media  by  their  permittivity  ε,  permeability  μ,  and  conductivity  σ.  In  general  ε,  η, 
and σ  can  be  complex,  frequency  dependent,  and  functions  of  field  direction.   They  can  also  be 
functions  of  density,  temperature,  field  strength,  and  other  quantities.    Moreover  they  can  also 
couple⎯E to⎯B, and⎯H  to⎯D.  In  this section we only  treat  the special cases of anisotropic media 
(Section 9.5.1), dispersive media (Section 9.5.2), and plasmas (Section 9.5.3).  Lossy media were 
treated in Sections 9.2.4 and 9.2.5. 

Anisotropic  media,  by  definition,  have  permittivities,  permeabilities,  and/or  conductivities 
that  are  functions  of  field  direction.    We  can  generally  represent  these  dependences  by  3×3 
matrices (tensors), i.e.: 

D = εE 

B = μH 

J = σE 

For example, (9.5.1) says: 

D = ε 
x 
xx
D y  = ε yx
Dz  = εzx

 E x  + ε xy
 E y  + ε xz
 E z 
 E x  + ε yy
 E y  + ε yz

 E y  + εzz
 E x  + εzy

(9.5.2) 

(9.5.3) 

(9.5.4) 

Most  media  are  symmetric  so  that  εij  =  εji;  in  this  case  the  matrix  ε   can  always  be 
diagonalized  by  rotating  the  coordinate  system  to  define  new  directions  x,  y,  and  z  that  yield 
zeros off-axis: 

⎛ ε x

ε = ⎜
⎜  0
⎝ 

0 
ε y
0 

0  ⎞ 
⎟ 
0  ⎟
ε ⎟
z ⎠ 

(9.5.5) 

These  new  axes  are  called  the  principal  axes  of  the  medium.    The  medium  is  isotropic  if  the 
permittivities  of  these  three  axes  are  equal,  uniaxial  if  only  two  of  the  three  axes  are  equal,  and 
biaxial  if  all  three  differ.  For  example,  tetragonal,  hexagonal,  and  rhombohedral  crystals  are 
uniaxial,  and  orthorhombic,  monoclinic,  and  triclinic  crystals  are  biaxial.    Most  constitutive 
tensors  are  symmetric  (they  equal  their  own  transpose),  the  most  notable  exception  being 
permeability  tensors  for magnetized media  like  plasmas  and  ferrites,  which  are  hermetian49  and 
not discussed in this text. 

One immediate consequence of anisotropic permittivity and (9.5.4) is that  D  is generally no 
longer parallel to  E , as suggested in Figure 9.5.1 for a uniaxial medium.   When εxx  ≠ εzz,  E  and  
D   are  parallel  only  if  they  lie  along  one  of  the  principal  axes.    As  explained  shortly,  this 
property  of  uniaxial  or  biaxial  media  can  be  used  to  convert  any  wave  polarization  into  any 
other.

Figure 9.5.1  D  and  E  in an anisotropic medium. 

The  origins  of  anisotropy  in  media  are  easy  to  understand  in  terms  of  simple  models  for 
crystals.  For example, an isotropic cubic lattice becomes uniaxial if it is compressed or stretched 
along  one  of  those  axes,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  9.5.2(a)  for  z-axis  compression.    That  such 
compressed  columns  act  to  increase  the  effective  permittivity  in  their  axial  direction  can  be 
understood  by  noting  that  each  of  these  atomic  columns  functions  like  columns  of  dielectric 
between  capacitor  plates,  as  suggested  in  Figure  9.5.2(b).    Parallel-plate  capacitors  were

one of the capacitor plates, as illustrated in Figure 9.5.2(c).

Even  though  half  the  volume  between  the  capacitor  plates  is  occupied  by  dielectric  in  both 
these  cases,  the  capacitance  for  the  columns  [Figure  9.5.2(b)]  is  greater,  corresponding  to  a 
greater  effective  permittivity  εeff.  This  can  be  shown  using Equation  (3.1.10), which  says  that  a 
parallel  plate  capacitor  has  C  =  εeffA/d, where A  is  the  plate  area  and  d  is  the  distance  between 
the plates.   The capacitances Ca and Cb  for Figures 9.5.2(b) and  (c) correspond  to  two capacitors 
in parallel and series, respectively, where:

In the limit where ε >> εo the permittivity ratio εeff(a)/ εeff(b) → ε/4εo > 1.  In all compressive cases 
εeff(a)  ≥ εeff(b).  If  the  crystal  were  stretched  rather  than  compressed,  this  inequality  would  be 
reversed.  Exotic complex materials can exhibit inverted behavior, however. 

Since  the  permittivity  here  interacts  directly  only  with  E ,  not  H ,  the  velocity  of 
propagation  c  =  1 /  
με   depends  only  on  the  permittivity  in  the  direction  of  E .    We  therefore 
expect slower propagation of waves linearly polarized so that  E  is parallel to an axis with higher 
values  of  ε.  We  can  derive  this  behavior  from  the  source-free  Maxwell’s  equations  and  the 
matrix constitutive relation (9.5.4).

Combining the curl of Faraday’s law (9.5.8) with Ampere’s law (9.5.9), as we did in Section

(9.5.13) 

This  expression  can  be  separated  into  independent  equations  for  each  axis.   Waves  propagating

The wave equation  (9.5.14) characterizes  the propagation of x-polarized waves and  (9.5.15)

correct  is  easily  seen  by  noting  that  the  standard  wave  solution  for  both  x-  and  y-  polarized 
waves  satisfies  these  constraints.    Since  ∇  is  distributive,  the  equation  is  also  satisfied  for 
arbitrary linear combinations of x- and y- polarized waves, which is the most general case here.

If  a  wave  has  both  x-  and  y-polarized  components,  the  polarization  of  their  superposition 
will  evolve  as  they  propagate  along  the  z  axis  at  different  velocities.    For  example,  a  linearly 
wave  polarized  at  45  degrees  to  the  x  and  y  axes  will  evolve  into  elliptical  and  then  circular 
polarization before evolving back into linear polarization orthogonal to the input. 

This ability of a birefringent medium  to  transform polarization  is  illustrated  in Figure 9.5.3. 
In this case we can represent the linearly polarized wave at z = 0 as: 

E ( z = 0 ) = E o ( xˆ

Polarization  conversion  is  commonly  used  in  optical  systems  to  convert  linear  polarization 
to  circular,  or  vice-versa,  via  a  quarter-wave  plate  for  which  Δφ  is  90o,  equivalent  to  a  quarter 
wavelength.  A half-wave plate (Δφ = 180o) reverses the sense of any polarization. 

Example 9.5A 
A certain birefringent medium is characterized by μo, εx = 2εo, εy = 2.002εo.  How thick D must a 
quarter-wave plate be  if λ = 5×10-7[m]  in  free  space  (visible  light)?   At what  thickness D' might 
this same plate rotate appropriate linear polarization 90 degrees?

Solution:  	  The  phase  lags  along  the  x  and  y  axes  arise  from  e− jk x D and e 
y 
,  respectively, 
and  the difference  is π/2 =  (ky  - kx)D  for a quarter-wave plate.   But ki = ω(μoεi)0.5,  so

mm, which  is  approximately  the  thickness  of  a Vu-Graph  transparency  that  acts  as  a 
quarter-wave  plate.  A  differential  phase  lag  of  π  yields  90°  polarization  rotation  for 
waves  linearly  polarized  at  an  angle  45°  from  the  principal  axes  x  and  y,  so  the 
thickness would be doubled to ~0.36 mm. 

9.5.2  Waves in dispersive media 

Dispersive  media  have  wave  velocities  that  are  frequency  dependent  due  to  the  frequency 
dependence  of  μ,  ε,  or  σ.  These  frequency  dependencies  arise  in  all  materials  because  of  the 
non-instantaneous  physical  responses  of  electrons  to  fields.    Often  these  time  lags  are  so  brief 
that  only  at  optical  frequencies  do  they  become  a  significant  fraction  of  a  period,  although 
propagation  over  sufficiently  long  paths  can  introduce  significant  cumulative  differences  in 
effects across any frequency band or gap.  Only vacuum is essentially non-dispersive. 

- 295 -
 

The  principal  consequence  of  dispersion  is  that  narrowband  pulse  signals  exhibit  two 
velocities,  the  phase  velocity  vp  of  the  sinusoids  within  the  pulse  envelope,  and  the  group 
velocity vg at which the pulse envelope, energy, and information propagate.  Because energy and 
information  travel  at  the  group  velocity,  it  never  exceeds  the  velocity  of  light  although  phase 
velocity frequently does. 

A  simple  way  to  reveal  this  phenomenon  is  to  superimpose  two  otherwise  identical 
sinusoidal  waves  propagating  at  slightly  different  frequencies,  ω  ±  Δω;  superposition  is  valid 
because Maxwell’s equations are linear.  The corresponding wave numbers are k ± Δk, where Δk 
<< k and Δω << ω.  Such a superposition for two sinusoids propagating in the +z direction is: 

E( t , z)  = Eo cos [(ω + Δω) t − ( k + Δk ) z ] + Eo cos [(ω − Δωt ) − ( k − Δk ) z ] 
= Eo 2 cos (ωt − kz ) cos ( Δωt − Δkz ) 

(9.5.18) 

where we used  the  identity cos α + cos β = 2 cos[(α+β)/2] cos[(α−β)/2].  The  first  factor on  the 
right-hand  side  of  (9.5.18)  is  a  sine  wave  propagating  at  the  center  frequency  ω  at  the  phase 
velocity: 

vp  = ω k  

(phase velocity) 

(9.5.19)
 

The second factor is the low-frequency, long-wavelength modulation envelope that propagates at 
the group velocity vg = Δω/Δk, which is the slope of the ω(k) dispersion relation: 

vg  = ∂ω ∂  k = ( ∂k

Note  that  this  dispersion  relation  has  a  phase  velocity  that  approaches  infinity  at  the  lowest 
frequencies,  which  is  what  happens  in  plasmas  near  the  plasma  frequency,  as  discussed  in  the 
next section. 

Communications  systems  employ  finite-duration  pulses  with  Fourier  components  at  all 
frequencies,  so  if  such  pulses  travel  sufficiently  far  even  the  envelope  with  its  finite  bandwidth 
will  become  distorted.    As  a  result  dispersive media  are  either  avoided  or  compensated  in most 
communications  system  unless  the  bandwidths  are  sufficiently  narrow.    Compensation  is 
possible  because  dispersion  is  a  linear  process  so  inverse  filters  are  readily  designed.    Section 
12.2.2 discusses dispersion further in the context of optical fibers.

9.5.3  Waves in plasmas 

A plasma is a charge-neutral gaseous assembly of atoms or molecules with enough free electrons 
to  significantly  influence  wave  propagation.    Examples  include  the  ionosphere50,  the  sun, 
interiors of  fluorescent bulbs or nuclear  fusion  reactors,  and  even  electrons  in metals or  electron 
pairs in superconductors.  We can characterize fields in plasmas once we know their permittivity 
ε at the frequency of interest. 

To compute the permittivity of a non-magnetized plasma we recall (2.5.8) and (2.5.13): 

D = εE = εo E + P = εo E + nqd

 

(9.5.21)
 

where  q  =  -e  is  the  electron  charge,  d   is  the  mean  field-induced  displacement  of  the  electrons 
from  their  equilibrium  positions,  and  n3  is  the  number  of  electrons  per  cubic  meter.    Although 
positive  ions  are  also  displaced,  these  displacements  are  generally  negligible  in  comparison  to 
those of the electrons because the electron masses me are so much less.  We can take the mass mi 
of  the  ions  into  account  simply  by  replacing me  in  the  equations  by mr,  the  reduced mass  of  the 
electrons, where it can be shown that mr = memi/(me + mi) ≅ me. 

 
To determine ε in (9.5.21) for a collisionless plasma, we merely need to solve Newton’s law 
for  d( t ) , where the force  f  follows from (1.2.1): 

f  = qE = ma = m (

jω  d 

(9.5.22)

50  The  terrestrial  ionosphere  is  a  partially  ionized  layer  at  altitudes  ~50-5000  km,  depending  primarily  upon  solar 
ionization.  Its peak electron density is ~1012 electrons m-3 at 100-300 km during daylight.

(9.5.25) 

The plasma  frequency  is  the natural  frequency of oscillation of a displaced electron or cluster of 
electrons  about  their  equilibrium  location  in  a  neutral  plasma,  and  we  shall  see  that  the 
propagation of waves above and below this frequency is markedly different. 

The dispersion relation for a collisionless non-magnetic plasma is thus: 
k 2  = ω2με = ω2μo oε (1 − ω 2  p  ω2 ) 

(9.5.26) 

which is plotted as ω(k) in Figure 9.5.5 together with the slopes representing the phase and group 
velocities of waves in plasmas.

Since vpvg = c2, and since vg  ≤ c, it follows that vp  is alway equal  to or greater than c.   However, 
for ω < ωp we find vp and vg become imaginary because normal wave propagation is replaced by 
another behavior. 

From (9.5.26) we see that when ω < ωp:

where  the sign of ±jα was chosen  (-)  to correspond  to exponential decay of  the wave rather  than 
growth.  We  find  from  (9.5.32)  that  H(t)  is  delayed  90o  behind  E(t),  that  both  decay 
exponentially with z, and that the Poynting vector⎯S is purely imaginary: 
S = ×E  H  = − jz ˆ ( α Eo  ωμ ) −2 zα

Such  an  evanescent wave  decays  exponentially  and  carry  only  reactive  power  and  no  time-
 
average power because of the time orthogonality of E and H.  Reactive power implies that below 
ωp  the  average  energy  stored  is  predominantly  electric,  but  in  this  case  the  stored  energy  is 
actually  dominated  by  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  electrons.    It  is  this  extra  energy  that  allows  the 
permittivity  ε  to  become  negative  below  ωp  although  μo  remains  constant.    The  frequency  ωp 
below which  conversion  from propagation  to evanescence occurs  is called  the cut-off  frequency, 
which is the plasma frequency here.
