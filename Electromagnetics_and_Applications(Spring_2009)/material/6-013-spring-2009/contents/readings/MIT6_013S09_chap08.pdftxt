8.1.1  Lossless transmission lines 

The  speed  of  computation  and  signal  processing  is  limited  by  the  time  required  for  charges  to 
move  within  and  between  devices,  and  by  the  time  required  for  signals  to  propagate  between 
elements.    If  the  devices  partially  reflect  incoming  signals  there  can  be  additional  delays  while 
the  resulting  reverberations  fade.   Finally,  signals may  distort  as  they  propagate,  smearing  pulse 
shapes  and  arrival  times.    These  three  sources  of  delay,  i.e.,  propagation  plus  reverberation, 
device  response  times,  and  signal  distortion  are  discussed  in  Sections  8.1,  8.2,  and  8.3, 
respectively.   These  same  issues  apply  to  any  system  combining  transmission  lines  and  circuits, 
such  as  integrated  analog  or  digital  circuits,  printed  circuit  boards,  interconnections  between 
circuits or antennas, and electrical power lines. 

Transmission  lines  are  usually  paired  parallel  conductors  that  convey  signals  between 
devices.  They  are  fundamental  to  every  electronic  system,  from  integrated  circuits  to  large 
systems.    Section  7.1.2  derived  from  Maxwell’s  equations  the  behavior  of  transverse 
electromagnetic  (TEM) waves  propagating  between  parallel  plate  conductors,  and  Section  7.1.3 
showed  that  the  same  equations  also  govern  any  structure,  even  a  dissipative  one,  for which  the 
cross-section  is  constant  along  its  length  and  that has  at  least  two perfectly  conducting  elements 
between  which  the  exciting  voltage  is  applied.    Using  differential  RLC  circuit  elements,  this 
section below derives the same transmission-line behavior in a form that can readily be extended 
to  transmission  lines  with  resistive  wires,  as  discussed  later  in  Section  8.3.1.    Since  resistive 
wires introduce longitudinal electric fields, such lines are no longer pure TEM lines. 

Equations  (7.1.10)  and  (7.1.11)  characterized  the  voltage  v(t,z)  and  current  i(t,z)  on  TEM 
structures with inductance L [H m-1] and capacitance C [F m-1] as: 

dv dz = −L di dt 

di dz = −C dv dt 

(8.1.1)
 

(8.1.2)
 

These expressions were combined to yield the wave equation (7.1.14) for lossless TEM lines:

One general solution to this wave equation is (7.1.16):

which  corresponds  to  the  superposition  of  forward  and  backward  propagating  waves  moving  at 
velocity  c  =  (LC)-0.5  =  (με)-0.5 .  The  current  i(t,z)  corresponding  to  (8.1.4)  follows  from 
substitution of (8.1.4) into (8.1.1) or (8.1.2), and differentiation followed by integration:

The value of Yo follows directly from the steps above. 

A more  intuitive way  to  derive  these  equations  utilizes  an  equivalent  distributed  circuit  for 
the  transmission  line  composed  of  an  infinite  number  of  differential  elements  with  series 
inductance  and  parallel  capacitance,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.1(a).    This  model  is  easily 
extended to non-TEM lines with resistive wires.

The  inductance  L  [Henries  m-1]  of  the  two  conductors  arises  from  the  magnetic  energy 
stored per meter of  length,  and produces  a voltage drop dv  across  each  incremental  length dz of 
wire which is proportional to the time derivative of current through it40: 

dv = −L dz ( di dt ) 

(8.1.7)
 

Any  current  increase  di  across  the  distance  dz,  defined  as  di  =  i(t,  z+dz)  -  i(t,z),  would  be 
supplied from charge stored in C [F m-1]: 

40  An  alternate  equivalent  circuit  would  have  a  second  inductor  in  the  lower  branch  equivalent  to  that  in  the  upper 
branch; both would have value Ldz/2, and v(t,z) and i(t,z) would remain the same. 

- 230 -


di = −C dz ( dv dt ) 

(8.1.8)
 

These  two  equations  for dv  and di  are  equivalent  to  (8.1.1) and  (8.1.2),  respectively, and  lead  to 
the  same  wave  equation  and  general  solutions  derived  in  Section  7.1.2  and  summarized  above, 
where  arbitrary  waveforms  propagate  down  TEM  lines  in  both  directions  and  superimpose  to 
produce the total v(z,t) and i(t,z). 

Two equivalent solutions exist for this wave equation: (8.1.4) and (8.1.9): 

v ( z, t  ) = f + ( t − z c ) + f − ( t + z c ) 

(8.1.9) 

The validity of (8.1.9) is easily shown by substitution into the wave equation (8.1.3), where again 
c = (LC)-0.5 .  This alternate form is useful when relating line signals to sources or loads for which 
z  is  constant,  as  illustrated  below.  The  first  form  (8.1.4)  in  terms  of  (z  -  ct)  is more  convenient 
when t is constant and z varies. 

Waves can be launched on TEM lines as suggested in Figure 8.1.1(b).  The line is driven by 
the Thevenin  equivalent  source vs(t)  in  series with  the  source  resistance Zo, which  is matched  to 
the  transmission  line  in  this  case.    Equations  (8.1.4)  and  (8.1.5)  say  that  if  there  is  no  negative 
traveling  wave,  then  the  ratio  of  the  voltage  to  current  for  the  forward  wave  on  the  line  must 
equal Zo  = Y -1
o .  The  equivalent  circuit  for  this TEM  line  is  therefore  simply  a  resistor  of  value 
Zo,  as  suggested  in Figure  8.1.1(c).    If  the  source  resistance  is  also Zo,  then  only  half  the  source 
voltage  vs(t)  appears  across  the  TEM  line  terminals  at  z  =  0.    Therefore  the  voltages  at  the  left 
terminals (z = 0) and on the line v(t,z) are:

(transmitted signal) 

(8.1.11) 

where  we  have  used  the  solution  form  of  (8.1.9).    The  propagating  wave  in  Figure  8.1.1(b)  has 
half  the amplitude of  the Thevenin  source vs(t) because  the source was matched  to  the  line so as 
to maximize the power transmitted from the given voltage vs(t).  Note that (8.1.11) is the same as 
(8.1.10)  except  that  z/c  was  subtracted  from  each.    Equality  is  preserved  if  all  arguments  in  an 
equation are shifted the same amount. 

If  the Thevenin  source  resistance were R,  then  the voltage-divider equation would yield  the 
terminal and propagating voltage v(t,z): 

v t(

),z  = vs ( t − z c  )⎡⎣Zo  (R + Zo )⎤⎦ 

(8.1.12) 

This more general expression reduces to (8.1.10) when R = Zo and z = 0.

A  certain  integrated  circuit  with  μ  =  μo  propagates  signals  at  velocity  c/2,  and  its  TEM  wires 
exhibit Zo = 100 ohms.  What are ε, L, and C for these TEM lines? 

Solution:	 c =  (μ ε )-0.5

L = Zo/v = 200/c = 6.67×10-7 [Hy], and C = 1/vZo = 1/200c = 1.67×10-11 [F].

8.1.2  Reflections at transmission line junctions 

If  a  transmission  line  connecting  a  source  to  a  load  is  sufficiently  short,  then  the  effects  of  the 
line  on  reflections  can  be  modeled  by  simply  replacing  it  with  a  small  lumped  capacitor  across 
the source  terminals  representing  the capacitance between  the wires, and a  resistor  in series with 
an  inductor  and  the  load,  representing  the  resistance  and  inductance  of  the  wires.    If,  however, 
the  line  length  D  is  such  that  the  propagation  time  τline  =  D/c  is  a  non-trivial  fraction  of  the 
shortest  time constant of  the  load τload,  then we should use  transmission  line models governed by 
the wave  equation  (e.g.,  8.1.3).    That  is,  the  TEM wave  equation  should  be  used  unless  the  line 
length D is: 

D (cid:19) cτload	

(8.1.13)
 

For  larger  values  of  D  the  propagation  delays  become  important  and  a  transmission  line 
model must be used, as explained  in Section 8.1.1.   Section 8.1.1 also explained how signals are 
launched  and  propagate  on  TEM  lines,  and  how  the  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  (8.1.6)  for  a 
passive  transmission  line  as  seen  by  the  source  is  simply  a  resistor  Z   =  (L/C)0.5
.  This 
o
characteristic  impedance  Zo of  the  transmission  line  is  the  ratio of  the  forward voltage v+(t,z)  to 
the associated current i+(z,t).  TEM signals are partially transmitted and partially reflected at each 
junction  they encounter, where  these  junctions may be  the  intended  load or  simply places where 
the  impedance Zo of  the  transmission  line changes.   Sometimes multiple  transmission  lines meet 
at such junctions. 

Section  7.2.2  (7.2.7)  derived  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ for  an  arbitrary  TEM  wave  v+(t,z) 
reflected by a load resistance R at z, where the normalized impedance of the load is Rn = R/Zo:

(8.1.16)
 

It  is  important  to  distinguish  the  difference  between  Γ  for  purely  resistive  loads,  which  is  real, 
and  Γ(ω), which  is  complex  and  applies  to  any  complex  load  impedance  ZL.  Here R  and  Γ are 
real.

Consider  the  example  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.2(a),  where  a  TEM  line  is  characterized  by 
impedance Zo and phase velocity c.  The line is D meters long, open circuit at the right-hand end, 
and  driven  by  a  unit-step41  voltage  u(t).  The  equivalent  circuit  at  the  source  end  of  the  line  is 
illustrated  in  (b), which  is  simply  a  voltage  divider  that  places  vs(t)/2  volts  across  the  line.    But 
the  voltage  across  the  line  equals  the  sum  of  the  forward  and  backward moving waves, where  a 
passive  line at  rest has no backward wave.   Therefore  the  forward wave here at z = 0+  is  simply 
u(t)/2, and the result is a voltage of 0.5 volts that moves down the line at velocity c, as illustrated 
in  Figure  8.1.2(c)  for  t  =  to.  The  associated  current  i(z,  t)  is  plotted  in  (d)  for  t  =  to,  and  is 
proportional to the voltage.

Once  the  transient  reaches  the  right-hand  end,  boundary  conditions must  again  be  satisfied, 
so  there  is  a  reflected  voltage wave  having  v-(t,  z=D)  = Γv+(t,  z=D), where Γ  =  +1,  as  given  by 
(8.1.15)  for  Rn  → ∞.  The  total  voltage  on  the  line  (8.1.9)  is  the  sum  of  the  forward  and 
backward waves,  each  of  value  0.5  volts,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.2(c)  for  t  =  t1  > D/c.  At  t1 
the  reflected  voltage  step  is  propagating  leftward  toward  the  source.    The  current  at  t  =  t1  is 
plotted in Figure 8.1.2(d). 

Although  these  voltage  and  current  transients  are  most  easily  represented  and  understood 
graphically,  they  can  also  be  derived  and  represented  algebraically.    For  example,  v(t,  z=0)  = 
u(t)/2  here,  and  therefore  for  t  <  D/c  we  have  v(t,z)  =  v+(t  -  z/c)  =  u(t  -  z/c)/2.    Note  that  if  we 
translate  an  argument  on  one  side  of  an  equation,  we  must  impose  the  same  translation  on  the 
other;  thus  v(t,0)→v(t  -  z/c)  forces  u(t,0)→u(t  -  z/c).  Once  the  wave  reflects  from  the  open 
circuit we have v(z,t) = v+(t  - z/c) + v-(t + z/c).  At z = D  for  t < 3D/c  the boundary condition at 
the open circuit  requires Γ = +1,  so v-(t + D/c) = v+(t  - D/c) = u(t  - D/c)/2.   From v-(t + D/c) we 
can  find  the  more  general  expression  v-(t  +  z/c)  simply  by  operating  on  their  arguments: 
v-(t + z/c) = v-(t + D/c –D/c + z/c) = u(t - 2D/c + z/c).  The total voltage for t < 2D/c is the sum of 
these forward and backward waves: v(t,z) = [u(t - z/c) + u(t - 2D/c + z/c)]/2.  The same approach 
can represent line currents and also more complex examples. 

41  We use  the notation u(t)  to represent a unit-step  function  that  is zero for t < 0, and unity for  t ≥ 0.  A unit  impulse 
is represented by δ(t), which is zero for all |t| > ε in the limit where ε → 0, and the integral of δ(t) ≡ 0.  ∫δ(t)dt = u(t).

When  the reflected wave arrives back at  the source, Γ = 0 because  this source  is matched  to 
the  transmission  line.    In  this  special  case  there  are  no  further  reflections.    Steady  state  is 
therefore one volt on the line everywhere, with v+ = v- = 0.5 in perpetuity.   The total line current 
is  the  difference  between  the  forward  and  backward  wave  (8.1.5),  as  plotted  in  Figure  8.1.2(d) 
for t1.  The steady-state current is therefore zero.  These steady state values correspond to ω → 0 
and  λ → ∞,  so  the  line  is  then  much  shorter  than  any  wavelength  of  interest  and  can  be 
considered  static.  We  can  easily  see  that  an  open-circuit  line  connected  to  a  voltage  source  via 
any  impedance at all will eventually assume  the same voltage as  the source, and  the current will 
be zero, as it is here. 

If  the  line  were  short-circuited  at  the  right-hand  end,  then  Γ  =  -1  and  the  voltage  v(z)  at  t1 
would  resemble  that  of  the  current  in  Figure  8.1.2(d), with  the  values  0.5  and  0  volts, while  the 
current  i(z)  at  t1 would  resemble  that of  the voltage  in  (c), with  the values 0.5/Zo  and 1/Zo.  The 
steady  state  values  for  voltage  and  current  in  this  short-circuit  case  are  zero  and  1/Zo, 
respectively. 

If  the  first  transmission  line  were  connected  to  a  second  passive  infinite  line  of  impedance 
Zb,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.3(a),  then  the  same  computations  would  yield  v(t,z)  and  i(t,z)  on 
the  first  transmission  line,  where  Rn  =  Zb/Zo.    The  solution  on  the  second  line  follows  from  the 
boundary  conditions:  v(t)  and  i(t)  are  both  continuous  across  the  boundary.    The  resulting 
waveforms v(t1,z) and i(t1,z) at time D/c < t1 < 2D/c are plotted in Figure 8.1.3(b) for the case Rn 
=  0.5,  so  Γ  =  -  1/3.    In  this  case  the  current  is  increased  by  the  reflection  while  the  voltage  is 
diminished.    Independent  of  the  incident  waveform,  the  fraction  of  the  incident  power  that  is 
reflected  is  (v-/v+)2  =  Γ2, where  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ  is  given  by  (8.1.15);  the  transmitted 
fraction is 1 - Γ2.

The principal consequence of  this  reflection phenomenon  is  that  the voltage across a device 
may not be what was  intended  if  there  is an impedance mismatch between  the TEM  line and  the 
device.  This is an issue only when the line is sufficiently long that line delays are non-negligible

compared  to  circuit  time  constants  (8.1.13).   The  analysis  above  is  for  linear  resistive  loads,  but 
most loads are non-linear or reactive, and their treatment is discussed in Section 8.1.4. 

8.1.3  Multiple reflections and reverberations 

The  reflected waves  illustrated  in  Figures  8.1.2  and  8.1.3  eventually  impact  the  source  and may 
be  reflected  yet  again.  Since  superposition  applies  if  the  sources  and  loads  are  linear,  the 
contributions from each reflection can be separately determined and  then added  to yield  the  total 
voltage  and  current.  That  is,  the  reflected  v-(t,z) will  yield  its  own  reflection  at  the  source,  and 
the  fate of  this  reflection  can be  followed  independently of  the original  forward wave.   As usual 
when analyzing linear circuits, all sources are set to zero when determining the contribution of an 
independent source such as v-(t,z). 

This  paradigm  is  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.4,  which  involves  a  unit-step  current  source 
driving an open-circuited TEM line that is characterized by Zo, c, and length D.  Figures 8.1.4(a), 
(b),  and  (c)  illustrate  the  circuit,  the  voltage  at  t1,  and  the  current  at  t1,  respectively,  where  t1  = 
D/2c.  The  reflection  coefficient Γ = 1  (8.1.15)  for  the  open  circuit  at  z  = D,  so  the  incident  Zo­
volt  step  is  reflected  positively,  and  the  total  voltage  where  they  superimpose  is  2Zo  volts,  as 
illustrated in (d) for t2 = 1.5D/c.  The current at this moment is Yo[v+(t - z/c) - v-(t + z/c)], which 
is  zero  where  the  forward  and  reverse  waves  overlap,  as  illustrated  in  (e).    When  v-(t  +  z/c)  is 
reflected  from  the  left-hand  end  it  sees  Γ  =  +1  because,  when  using  superposition,  we  consider 
the  current  source  to  be  zero,  corresponding  to  an  open  circuit.    Thus  an  additional  Zo  volts, 
associated with  v+2,  adds  to  v+1  and  v-1  to  yield  a  total  of  3Zo  volts,  as  illustrated  in  (f)  at  t3;  the 
notation  v+i  refers  to  the  ith  forward  wave  v+.  This  process  continues  indefinitely,  with  the 
voltage  continuing  to  increase  by  Zo  volts  every  D/c  seconds  until  something  breaks  down. 
Voltage  breakdowns  are  expected  when  current  sources  feed  open  circuits;  the  finite  rate  of 
voltage increase is related to the total capacitance of the TEM line.

Figure 8.1.4  Transients for a current source driving an open-circuited TEM line. 
 

The  behavior  of  the  current  i(t,z)  is  interesting  too.   Figure  8.1.4(c)  illustrates  how  the  one-
ampere  current  from  the  current  source  propagates  down  the  line  at  velocity  c,  and  (e)  shows 
how  the  “message”  that  the  line  is  open-circuited  is  returned:  the  current  is  returning  to  zero. 

- 235 -


When this left-moving wave is reflected at the left-hand end the current is again forced to be one 
ampere  by  the  current  source.    Thus  the  current  distribution  (c)  also  applies  to  (f)  at  t3.  This 
oscillation  between  one  and  zero  amperes  continues  indefinitely,  much  like  an  unresolved 
argument  between  two  people,  each  end  of  the  line  forcing  the  current  to  satisfy  its  own 
boundary conditions while that message propagates back and forth at velocity c. 

Example 8.1B 
A  unit  step  voltage  source  u(t) with  no  source  resistance  drives  a  short-circuited  air-filled  TEM 
line  of  length  D  and  characteristic  impedance  Zo  =  1  ohm.   What  current  i(t)  flows  through  the 
short circuit at the end of this TEM line? 

Solution:	 The  unit  step  will  propagate  down  the  line,  be  reflected  at  the  short  circuit  at  z  =  D 
where  the  reflection  coefficient  ΓD  =  -1,  and  travel  back  to  the  voltage  source  at 
z  =  0,  which  this  transient  sees  as  a  short  circuit  (Δv  =  0),  also  having  ΓS  =  -1.  So, 
after  a  round-trip  delay  of  2D/c,  the  voltage  everywhere  on  the  line  is  zero,  after 
which  a  new  step  voltage  travels  down  the  line  and  superimposes  on  the  first  step 
voltage,  thus  adding  a  second  step  to  the  current  i(t,  z=D).    This  process  continues 
indefinitely  as  i(t)  steps  in  1-ampere  increments  every  2D/C  seconds  monotonically 
toward  infinity,  which  is  the  expected  current  when  a  voltage  source  is  short-
circuited.   The effect of  the  line  is simply  to slow  this  result as  the current and stored 
magnetic

the 
line 
build 
up. 
More 
precisely, 
v(t,  z=0)  ≡  u(t)  =  v+1(t,  z=0).  v+1(t,  z=D)  =  u(t  -  D/c),  so  the  TEM  line  presents  an 
equivalent circuit at z = D having Thevenin voltage vTh = 2v+1(t, D) = 2u(t - D/c), and 
Thevenin  impedance Zo;  this yields  i(t) = 2u(t - D/c)/Zo  for  t < 3D/c.  Therefore v-1(t, 
D)  =  ΓDv+1(t,  D)  = 
-u(t 
- D/c), 
so  v+2(t,  0)  =  ΓSv-1(t,  0)  = 
u(t  -  2D/c).  At  z  =  D  this  second  step  increases  the  Thevenin  voltage  by 
2u(t  -  3D/c)  and  increases  the  current  by  2u(t  -  3D/c)/Zo,  where  Zo  =  1  ohm. 
∞ 2u(t - [2n+1]D/c). 
Therefore i(t) = Σn=0 

8.1.4  Reflections by mnemonic or non-linear loads 

Most  junctions  involve  mnemonic42  or  non-linear  loads,  where  mnemonic  loads  are  capacitors, 
inductors, or other  energy  storage devices  that have  characteristics depending on  the past.   Non-
linear  loads  include  diodes,  transistors,  and  voltage-  or  current-dependent  capacitors  and 
inductors.  In either case the response to arbitrary waveforms cannot be determined by the simple 
methods  described  in  the  previous  section.    However  by  simply  replacing  the  transmission  line 
by  its  equivalent  circuit,  the  voltage  and  current  can  generally  be  easily  found,  first  at  the 
junction and then on the transmission line. 

The  equivalent  circuit  for  an  unexcited  transmission  line  is  simply  a  resistor  of  value  Zo 
because the ratio Δv/Δi for any excitation is always Zo.  Determining the voltage across this Zo is 
generally  straightforward  even  if  the  source  driving  the  line  contains  capacitors,  inductors,

diodes, or similar devices.  The forward-propagating wave voltage is simply the terminal voltage, 
as demonstrated in Figures 8.1.2–4. 

The  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  for  an  energized  TEM  line  has  a  Thevenin  voltage  source 
VTh  in  series  with  the  Thevenin  impedance  of  the  line:  ZTh  =  Zo.  Note  that  the  equivalent 
impedance for a TEM line is exactly Zo, regardless of any loads on the line.  The influence of the 
load  at  the  far  end  of  the  line  is  manifest  only  in  reflected  waves  that  may  propagate  from  it 
toward the observer, as discussed in the previous section. 

The  Thevenin  equivalent  voltage  of  any  linear  system  is  simply  its  open-circuit  voltage. 
The  open-circuit  voltage  of  a  transmission  line  is  twice  the  amplitude  of  any  incident  voltage 
waveform  because  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ  for  an  open  circuit  is  +1,  which  doubles  the 
incidence voltage at the junction position zJ: 

VTh ( t ,z J ) = v+ ( t ,z J ) + v− ( t ,z J ) = 2v + ( t ,z J ) 

(8.1.17) 

The procedure for analyzing a TEM line terminated by any load at z = zJ is then to: 1) solve 
for  the wave  v+(t  -  z/c)  traveling  toward  the  load  of  interest,  2)  set VTh  =  2v+(t  -  zJ/c)  and ZTh  = 
Zo, 3) solve for the terminal voltage v(t, zJ), 4) solve for v-(t,zJ), and 5) find v-(t + z/c), where we 
define z as increasing toward the load:

(wave reflected by load) 

(8.1.19)

Equation (8.1.19) says v-(t + z/c) is simply the v-(t, zJ) given by (8.1.18), but delayed by (zJ -z)/c. 

This procedure is best demonstrated by a simple example.  Figure 8.1.5(a) illustrates a TEM 
line  driven  by  a  matched  unit  step  voltage  source  and  terminated  with  a  capacitor  C.    This 
voltage  step,  reduced  by  a  factor  of  two  by  the  voltage  divider,  propagates  toward  the  capacitor 
at  velocity  c,  as  illustrated  in  (b).    The  capacitor  sees  the  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  illustrated 
in  (c);  it consists of Zo  in series with a Thevenin voltage source  that  is  twice v+, where v+(t,D)  is 
a 0.5-volt step delayed by  the propagation  time D/c.   Therefore VTh = u(t  - D/c), as  illustrated  in 
Figure  8.1.5(c)  and  (d).  The  solution  to  the  circuit  problem  of  (c)  is  the  junction  voltage  vJ(t) 
plotted  in  (e);  it  rises  exponentially  toward  its  1-volt  asymptote  with  a  time  constant  τ  =  ZoC 
seconds. 

To  solve  for v-(t,zJ) we  subtract v+(t,zJ)  from vJ(t), as  shown  in  (8.1.18) and  illustrated  in 
(f); this then yields v-(t + z/c) using (8.1.19).  The total voltage v(t1,z) on the line at time D/c < t1 
<  2D/c  is  plotted  in  (g)  and  is  the  sum  of  v+(t  -  z/c),  which  is  0.5  volts,  and  v-(t  +  z/c).  The 
corresponding  current  i(t1,z)  is  plotted  in  (h)  and  equals  Yo  times  the  difference  between  the 
forward and reverse voltage waves, as given by (8.1.5).  When v-(t,z) arrives at the source, it can 
be treated just as such waves were treated in Section 8.1.3.  In this case the source is matched, so 
there are no further reflections.

2v+(t,zJ)  is plotted  in  (d),  the  resulting  junction voltage vJ(t)  is plotted  in (e), v+(t,zJ)  is plotted  in

2D/c are plotted in (h) and (i), respectively.  Note that these reflected waveforms do not resemble 
the incident waveform. 

Example 8.1C 
If  the circuit  illustrated  in Figure 8.1.5(a) were  terminated by L  instead of C, what would be v(t, 
D), v-(t, D), and  v(t,0)? 

Solution:	 Figures  8.1.5(a–d)  still  apply,  except  that  L  replaces  C.    The  one-volt  Thevenin  step 
voltage at z = D in series with the Thevenin line impedance Zo yields a voltage v(t, D) 
across  the  inductor  of  u(t  -  D/c)e-tL/R.  Therefore  v-(t,  D)  =  v(t,  D)  -  v+(t,  D)  =  u(t  -
D/c)e-(t - D/c)L/R - 0.5u(t - D/c) and, since there are no further reflections at the matched 
load at z = 0, it follows that v(t,0) = 0.5u(t) + u(t - 2D/c)e-(t - 2D/c)L/R - 0.5u(t - 2D/c). 

8.1.5 

Initial conditions and transient creation 

Often  transmission  lines  have  an  initial  voltage  and  current  that  is  interrupted  in  some  way, 
producing  transients.  For example, a charged TEM line at rest may have a switch  thrown at one 
end  that  suddenly  connects  it  to  a  load,  or  disconnects  it;  such  a  switch  could  be  located  in  the 
middle  of  a  line  too,  either  in  series  or  parallel.    The  solution  method  has  two  main  steps:  1) 
determine  v+(t,z)  and  v-(t,z)  at  t  =  0- before  the  change  occurs,  and  2)  solve  for  the  subsequent 
behavior of the forward and backward moving waves for the given network configuration.

Figure 8.1.7  Transients induced by momentarily open-circuited active TEM line. 
 

The  simple  example  of  Figure  8.1.7  illustrates  the  method.    Assume  an  air-filled  2-meter 
long  100-ohm TEM  line  is  feeding  a  200-ohm  load R with  I  =  50 milliamperes, when  suddenly 
at t = 0 the line is open-circuited at z = 1 meters for 10-9 seconds, after which it returns to normal.  
What are the voltage and current on the line as a result of this temporary event? 

- 239 -


Using the method suggested above, we first solve for the forward and backward waves prior 
to  t  =  0;  the  current  i(t<0,  z)  is  given  as  I  =  50  milliamperes,  and  the  voltage  v(t<0,  z)  =  IR  is 
0.05  ×  200  ohms  =  10  volts.    Note  that  in  steady  state  Zo  does  not  affect  v(t<0,  z).  We  know 
from (8.1.4) and (8.1.5) that:

(8.1.23) 

These two voltages are shown in Figure 8.1.7(b), 7.5 volts for the forward wave and 2.5 volts for 
the reflected wave; this is consistent with the given 50-ma current. 

When  the  switch  opens  at  t  =  0  for  10-9  seconds,  it  momentarily  interrupts  both  v+  and  v-, 
which  see  an  open  circuit  at  the  switch  and  Γ =  +1.  Therefore  in  (c) we  see  7.5  volts  reflected 
back to the left from the switch, and 2.5 volts reflected back toward the right.  At distances closer 
to  the switch  than ct [m] we  therefore see 15 volts to the left and 5 volts to the right; this zone is 
propagating  outward  at  velocity  c.    When  the  switch  closes  again,  these  mid-line  reflections 
cease and the voltages and currents return to normal as the two transient pulses of 15 and 5 volts 
continue  to  propagate  toward  the  two  ends  of  the  line,  as  shown  in  (d),  where  they  might  be 
reflected further. 

The  currents  associated  with  Figure  8.1.7(d)  can  easily  be  surmised  using  (8.1.21).    The 
effects of the switch are only felt for that brief 10-9-second interval, and otherwise the current on 
the  line  is  the  original  50  ma.    In  the  brief  interval  when  the  switch  was  open  the  current  was 
forced  to  zero,  and  so  zero-current  pulses  of  duration  10-9  seconds  propagate  away  from  the 
switch in both directions. 

Example 8.1D 
A  100-ohm  air-filled  TEM  line  of  length  D  is  feeding  1  ampere  to  a  50-ohm  load  when  it  is 
momentarily  short-circuited  in  its middle  for a  time T < D/2c.   What are v+(z  - ct) and v-(z + ct) 
prior to the short circuit, and during it? 

Solution:	 For  t  <  0,  Γ =  v-(D  -  ct)/v+(D  +  ct)  =  (Zn  -  1)/(Zn  +  1)  =  -0.5/1.5  =  -1/3  where  Zn  = 
50/100.  Since the line voltage v(z,t) equals the current i times the load resistance (v = 
50  volts),  it  follows  that  v+  +  v- =  2v+/3  =  50,  and  therefore  v+  =  v+(z  -  ct)  = 
75 volts, and v-(z + ct) = -25.  During  the short circuit the voltage within a distance d 
= ct of the short is altered.  On the source side the short circuit reflects v- = -v+ = -75, 

- 240 -


	
so  the  total  voltage  (v+  +  v-)  within  ct  meters  of  the  short  circuit  is  zero,  and  on  the 
load side v+ = -v- = 25 is reflected, so the total voltage is again zero.  The currents left 
and 
right  of 
the 
short  are  different,  however,  because 
the  original 
v+  ≠  v-,  and  i+  =  v+/Zo.  Therefore,  on  the  source  side  near  the  short  circuit, 
i = (v+ - Γv+)/Zo = 2v+/Zo = 2×75/50 = 3 [A].  On the load side near the short circuit, I 
= -2×25/50 = -1 [A]. 

8.2 

Limits posed by devices and wires 

8.2.1 

Introduction to device models 

Most  devices  combine  conducting  elements  with  semiconductors,  insulators,  and  air  in  a 
complex  structure  that  stores,  switches,  or  transforms  energy  at  rates  limited  by  characteristic 
time constants governed by Maxwell’s equations and kinematics.   For example,  in vacuum  tubes 
electrons  are boiled  into vacuum  by  a  hot  negatively  charged  cathode with  small  fractions of  an 
electron volt of energy43.  Such  tubes switch state only so  fast as  the  free electrons can cross  the 
vacuum  toward  the  positively  charged  anode,  and  only  as  fast  as  permitted  by  the  RL  or  RC 
circuit  time constants  that control  the voltages accelerating or  retarding  the  electrons.   The  same 
physical limits also apply to most semiconductor devices, as suggested in Section 8.2.4, although 
sometimes  quantum  effects  introduce  non-classical  behavior,  as  illustrated  in  Section  12.3.1  for 
laser devices. 

Design  of  vacuum  tubes  for  use  above  ~100 MHz  was  difficult  because  high  voltages  and 
very  small  dimensions  were  required  to  shorten  the  electron  transit  time  to  fractions  of  a  radio 
frequency  (RF)  cycle.  The  wires  connecting  the  cathode,  anode,  and  any  grids  to  external 
circuits  also  contributed  inductance  that  limited  speed.   Trade-offs were  required.  For  example, 
as  the  cathode-anode  gap  was  diminished  to  shorten  electron  transit  times,  the  capacitance  C 
between  the  cathode  and  anode  increased  together  with  delays  associated  with  their  RC  time 
constant  τRC.  Exactly  the  same physical  issues of gap  length,  capacitance,  and τRC  arise  in most 
semiconductor devices.  The kinematics of electrons in vacuum was discussed in Sections 5.1.2– 
3, and the behavior of simple RL and RC circuits was discussed in Section 3.5.1. 

8.2.2 

Semiconductor device models 

One  simple  example  illustrates  typical  sources  of  lag  in  semiconductor  devices.    Both  pnp  and 
npn  transistors  are  composed of p-n  junctions  that contribute device-related delay.    Field-effect 
 
transistors  exhibit  related  lags.    Figures  8.2.1(a)  and  (b)  present  a  DC  p-n  junction  i-v 
characteristic and a circuit model that exhibits approximately correct delay characteristics for the 
case where low-loss metal wires are used for interconnecting devices. 

43 A thermal energy Eo of one electron volt (≅ 1.6×10-19 [J]) corresponds to a temperature T of ~11,600K, where Eo = 
kT  and  k  is  Boltzmann’s  constant:  k  ≅  1.38×10-23  [J/oK].    Thus  a  red-hot  cathode  at  ~1000K  would  boil  off  free 
electrons with thermal energies of ~0.1 e.v.

τ ≅ RbC 

When  the  ideal  diode  is  forward  biased  the  forward-bias  resistance Rf  determines  the  slope 
of  the  i-v  characteristic.  When  it  is  back-biased  beyond  ~Vb  the  ideal  diode  becomes  an  open 
circuit  so  the  junction  capacitance  C  becomes  important  and  the  back-bias  resistance  Rf  +  Rb  ≅ 
Rb determines the slope.  C arises because of the charge-free depletion region that exists in back-
biased  diodes,  an  explanation  of  which  is  given  in  Section  8.2.4.    C  decreases  as  the  back-bias 
voltage  increases because  the gap width d  increases and C ≅ εA/d  (3.1.10).  The bias voltage Vb 
in  the  equivalent  circuit  is  related  to  the  band  gap  between  the  valence  and  conduction  bands  in 
the  semiconductor,  and  is  ~1  volt  for  silicon  (see  Section  8.2.4  for  more  discussion).    The 
inductance  L  arises  primarily  from  wires  leading  externally,  and  is  discussed  further  in  Section 
8.2.3 for printed circuits, and estimated in Section 3.3.2 for isolated wires (3.3.17). 

Figure 8.2.1(c) represents a typical test voltage across a p-n junction applied as suggested in 
Figure  8.2.1(a).  It  begins  at  that  bias  voltage  v(t)  =  Vb  (~1  volt  in  silicon),  for  which  the 
equivalent  circuit  in Figure  8.2.1(b)  conducts  no  current  and  the  capacitor  is  discharged.   At  t = 
0+,  v(t)→Vo  and  the  current  i(t)  increases  toward  (Vo  -  Vb)/Rf  with  zero  incremental  resistance 
offered  by  the  diode  and  voltage  source,  so  the  time  constant  τ  is  L/Rf  seconds  (3.5.10),  as 
illustrated  in  Figure  8.2.1(d).    The  capacitor  remains  uncharged.    Section  3.5.1  discusses  time 
constants  for  simple  circuits.    As  a  result  of  diversion  of  energy  into  the  inductor,  the  current  i 
does  not  reach  levels  sufficient  to  trigger  the  next  circuit  element  until  t  ≅ δ1,  which  is  the  lag 
time. 

This  time  constant  δ1  can  be  easily  estimated.    For  example,  a  p-n  junction  might  be 
attached  to  wires  of  length  D  =  0.001  [m]  and  radius  ro  =  10-6  [m],  and  have  a  forward-biased 
resistance Rf of ~1 ohm.  In this case (3.3.17) yields the wire inductance:

(8.2.1)

Thus  δ1  ≅ τ =  L/R  =  1.7×10-10  seconds,  so  the  diode  might  handle  a  maximum  frequency  of 
~R/2πL  Hz,  or  ~1  GHz.    More  conservatively  the  diode  might  be  used  at  clock  frequencies 
below  ~0.2  GHz.  Modern  computers  employ  shorter  wires  and  smaller  Rf  in  order  to  work 
faster.    The  circuit  model  in  Figure  8.2.1(b)  does  not  include  the  capacitance  between  the  wire 
and the substrate because it is negligibly small here relative to the effects of L. 

When the test voltage v(t) then goes negative, the ideal diode in Figure 8.2.1(b) continues to 
conduct  until  the  current  through  the  inductor  decays  to  zero  with  the  same  L/Rf  time  constant. 
The  current  then  begins  charging  C  (as  the  depletion  layer  is  cleared  of  charge)  with  a  time 
constant  ~RbC  that  delays  the  current  response  for  a  total  of  ~δ2  seconds.  Note  that  for 
illustrative  purposes  the  current  scale  for  negative  i(t)  in  (d)  has  been  expanded  by  a  very  large 
factor (Rb/Rf) relative to the scale for positive i(t). 

When  the  test  voltage  then  returns  to  Vo  from  its  strong  negative  value,  it  must  first 
discharge  C  (re-populate  the  depletion  layer  with  charge)  before  the  ideal  diode  in  Figure 
8.2.1(c)  closes,  introducing  a  time  constant  of  ~RfC  that  we  can  estimate.    If  the  capacitance  C 
corresponds  to  a  depletion  layer  of  thickness  d  ≅ 10-7,  area A  ≅ 10-11  [m2],  and  permittivity  ε ≅ 
~10εo,  then  (3.1.10) yields C =  εA/d ≅ 10×8.8×10-12×10-11/10-7  ≅ 9×10-15  [F].  This yields RfC ≅ 
10-14  [s] << L/Rf,  so L/Rf would dominate  the  entire  transition,  resulting  in  a  total  lag of δ3  ≅ δ1 
seconds.  In  reality  i(t)  in  this  RLC  circuit  would  ring  at  ω ≅ (LC)-0.5  radians  per  second  as  i(t) 
and the ringing decay toward the asymptote i ≅ (Vo - Vb)/Rf. 

In  most  bi-polar  transistor  circuits  using  metal  wires  it  is  L/Rf  that  controls  the  maximum 
clock speed for the system, which is limited by the slowest junction and the most inductive wires 
in  the  entire  integrated  circuit.    In  MOS  integrated  circuits,  however,  the  resistivity  of  the 
polysilicon or diffusion layers used for conductors is sufficiently high that the wire inductance is 
often  no  longer  controlling,  as  discussed  in  Section  8.3.1.    Wire  inductance  is  most  easily 
reduced  by  using  shorter wider wires, which  also  reduces wire  resistance.    Longer  paths  can  be 
accommodated by using matched TEM lines, as discussed in Section 8.1. 

8.2.3  Quasistatic wire models 

The  lag  time  for  the  p-n  junction  of  Figure  8.2.1 was  dominated  by  L/Rf, where  L  originated  in 
the wires connected to the junction.  The effects of depletion layer capacitance C were negligible 
in comparison for the assumed device parameters.  In this section we examine the effects of wire 
capacitance and cross-section in limiting clock or signal frequencies.   

In  most  integrated  circuits  the  wires  are  planar  and  deposited  on  top  of  an  insulating  layer 
located over a conducting ground plane, as suggested in Figure 8.2.2.

These  values  combine  with  nominal  one-ohm  forward-bias  resistances  of  p-n  junctions  to  yield 
the time constants L/R = 3.6×10-8 seconds, and RC = 2.4×10-12 seconds.  Again the limit is posed 
by inductance.  Such printed circuit boards would be limited to frequencies f ≤ ~1/2πτ ≅ 4 MHz. 

The  numbers  cited  here  are  not  nearly  so  important  as  the  notion  that  interconnections  can 
strongly  limit frequencies of operation and circuit utility.   The quasistatic analysis above  is valid 
because  the  physical  dimensions  here  are  much  smaller  than  the  shortest  wavelength  (at  f  =  4 
MHz): λ = c/f ≅ 700 meters in air or ~230 meters in a dielectric with ε = 9εo.

resistance  of  forward-biased  p-n  junctions.    If  the  printed  wires  above  are  d  =10  microns  thick

Since  some  semiconductor  devices  have  forward  resistances  much  less  than  this,  wires  are 
sometimes  made  thicker  or  wider  to  compensate.    Wider  printed  wires  also  have  lower 
inductance  [see  (8.2.6)].   Width and  thickness are particularly  important for power supply wires, 
which often carry large currents. 

If  (8.2.7)  is  modified  to  represent  wires  on  integrated  circuits  where  the  dimensions  in 
microns  are  length  D  =  100,  thickness  d  =  0.1,  and  width  W  =  1,  then  R  =  20  ohms  and  far 
exceeds typical forward p-n junction resistances.  Limiting D to 20 microns while increasing d to 
0.4 and W to 2 microns would lower R to 0.5 ohms.  The resistivities of polysilicon and diffusion 
layers  often  used  for  conductors  can  be  1000  times  larger,  posing  even  greater  challenges. 
Clearly  wire  resistance  is  another  major  constraint  for  IC  circuit  design  as  higher  operating 
frequencies are sought. 

Example 8.2A 
A  certain  integrated  circuit  device  having  forward  resistance  Rf  =  0.1  ohms  is  fed  by  a 
polysilicon  conductor  that  is  0.2  microns  wide  and  thick,  2  microns  long,  and  supported 
0.1  micron  above  the  ground  plane  by  a  dielectric  having  ε  =  10εo.  The  conductivity  of  the 
polysilicon wire is ~5×104 S m-1.  What limits the switching time constant τ of this device? 

Solution:  	 R,  L,  and  C  for  the  conductor  can  be  found  from  (8.2.7),  (8.2.6),  and  (8.2.5), 
  R  =  D/dWσ  =  2×10-6/[(0.2×10-7)25×104]  =  1000,  L  ≅ μdD/W  =

1.26×10-15  [s],  and  (LC)0.5  =  2.11×10-14  [seconds/radian],  so  RC  limits  the  switching 
time.  If metal substituted for polysilicon, then LC would pose the limit here. 

8.2.4 

Semiconductors and idealized p-n junctions 

Among  the  most  commonly  used  semiconductors  are  silicon  (Si),  germanium  (Ge),  gallium 
arsenide (GAs), and indium phosphide (InP).  Semiconductors at low temperatures are insulators 
since all electrons are trapped in the immediate vicinity of their host atoms.  The periodic atomic 
spacing  of  crystalline  semiconductors  permits  electrons  of  sufficient  energy  to  propagate  freely 
without  scattering,  however.  Diodes  and  transistors  therefore  exhibit  conductivities  that  depend 
on  the  applied  voltages  and  resulting  electron  energy  distributions.   The  response  times  of  these 
devices  are  determined  by  electron  kinematics  and  the  response  times  of  the  circuits  and 
structures determining voltages and field strengths within the device. 

The  quantum  mechanical  explanation  of  such  electron  movement  invokes  the  wave  nature 
of electrons, which is governed by the Schroedinger wave equation (not explained here, although 
it  is similar  to  the electromagnetic wave equation).   The consequence  is  that semiconductors can 
be characterized by an energy diagram that shows possible electron energy states as a function of 
position  in  the  z  direction,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.2.3(a).    At  low  temperatures  all  electrons 
occupy  energy  states  in  the  lower  valence  band,  corresponding  to  bound  orbits  around  atoms. 
However  a  second  conduction  band  of  possible  energy  states  occupied  by  freely  moving 
electrons  exists  at  higher  energies  separated  from  the  valence  band  by  an  energy  gap  Eg  that 

- 245 -


varies with material,  but  is  ~1  e.v.  for  silicon.    For  example,  a  photon with  energy  hf  = Ep  > Eg 
can  excite  a  bound  electron  in  the  valence  band  to  a  higher  energy  state  in  the  conduction  band 
where  that  electron  can  move  freely  and  conduct  electricity.    In  fact  this  photo-excitation 
mechanism is often used in semiconductor photo detectors to measure the intensity of light.

Figure 8.2.3  Energy diagrams for p and n semiconductors and p-n junctions. 
 

The probability that an unbound electron in thermal equilibrium at temperature T has energy 
E is governed by the Boltzmann distribution P{E} = e-E/kT/kT, where the Boltzmann constant k = 
1.38×10-23  and  one  electron  volt  is  1.6×10-19  [J].    Therefore  thermal  excitation  will  randomly 
place  a  few  free  electrons  in  the  conduction  band  since  P{E>Eg}  >  0.  However  this  provides 
only extremely limited conductivity because a gap of ~1 e.v. corresponds to a temperature of E/k 
≅ 11,600K, much greater than room temperature.44 

To boost the conductivity of semiconductors a small fraction of doping atoms are added that 
either  easily  release  one  electron  (called  donor  atoms),  or  that  easily  capture  an  extra  electron 
(acceptor  atoms).  These  atoms  assume  energy  levels  that  are  just  below  the  conduction  band 
 
edge (donor atoms) or just above the valence band edge (acceptor atoms), as illustrated in Figure 
8.2.3(b)  and  (c),  respectively.  These  energy  gaps  are  quite  small  so  a  significant  fraction  of  the 
donor and acceptor atoms are typically ionized at room temperature. 

The  probability  that  an  electron  has  sufficient  energy  to  leap  a  gap  Ea  is  the  integral  of  the 
Boltzmann probability distribution from Ea to E→∞, and Ea is sufficiently small that this integral 
can  approach  unity  for  some  dopant  atoms.    The  base  energy  for  the  Boltzmann  distribution  is 

44 The Fermi level of an undoped semiconductor is midway between the valence and conduction bands, so ~one-half 
electron volt is actually sufficient to produce excitation, although far more electrons exist in the valence band itself.

the Fermi level; electrons fill the available energy levels starting with the lowest and ending with 
the highest being  (on  average)  at  the Fermi  level.   The Fermi  level usually  lies very  close  to  the 
energy  level  associated  with  the  donor  or  acceptor  atoms,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.2.3(b–f). 
Since holes are positively charged,  their exponential Boltzmann distribution appears  inverted on 
the energy diagram, as illustrated in (c). 

For  each  ionized  donor  atom  there  is  an  electron  in  the  conduction  band  contributing  to 
conductivity.    For  each  negatively  ionized  acceptor  atom  there  is  a  vacated  positively  charged 
“hole” left behind.  An adjacent electron can easily jump to this hole, effectively moving the hole 
location  to  the  space  vacated  by  the  jumping  electron;  in  this  fashion  holes  can migrate  rapidly 
and  provide  nearly  the  same  conductivity  as  electrons  in  the  conduction  band.    Semiconductors 
doped  with  donor  atoms  so  that  free  electrons  dominate  the  conductivity  are  n-type 
semiconductors  (negative  carriers  dominate),  while  holes  dominate  the  conductivity  of  p-type 
semiconductors  doped  with  acceptors  (positive  carriers  dominate).    Some  semiconductors  are 
doped  to  produce  both  types  of  carriers.  The  conductivity  of  homogeneous  semiconductors  is 
proportional  to  the  number  of  charge  carriers,  which  is  controlled  primarily  by  doping  density 
and temperature. 

If  a  p-n  junction  is  short-circuited,  the  Fermi  level  is  the  same  throughout  as  shown  in 
Figure  8.2.3(d).  Therefore  the  tails  of  the Boltzmann  distributions  on  both  sides  of  the  junction 
are based at the same energy, so there is no net flow of current through the circuit. 

When  the  junction  is  back-biased  by  Vo  volts  as  illustrated  in  (e),  the  Fermi  level  is 
depressed  correspondingly.  The  dominant  current  comes  from  the  tail  of  the  Boltzmann 
distribution of electrons in the conduction band of  the p-type semiconductor;  these few electrons 
will  be  pulled  to  the  positive  terminal  and  are  indicated  by  the  small  white  arrow.    Some  holes 
thermally  created  in  the  n-type  valence  band may  also  contribute  slightly.    Because  the  carriers 
come  from  the  high  tail  of  the  Boltzmann  thermal  distribution,  the  reverse  current  in  a  p-n 
junction is strongly dependent upon temperature and can be used as a thermometer; it is not very 
dependent  upon  voltage  once  the  voltage  is  sufficiently  negative.   When  a  p-n  junction  is  back-
biased,  the  electric  field  pulls  back  most  low-energy  free  electrons  into  the  n-type 
semiconductor,  and  pulls  the  holes  into  the  p-type  semiconductor,  leaving  a  carrier-free  layer, 
called a charge-depletion region,  that acts like a capacitor.   Larger values of Vo yield  larger gaps 
and smaller capacitance. 

When  the  junction  is  forward-biased  by  Vo  volts,  as  illustrated  in  (f),  the  charge-free  layer 
disappears  and  the  current  flow  is  dominated  by  the  much  greater  fraction  of  electrons  excited 
into  the  conduction  band  in  the  n-type  semiconductor  because  almost  all  of  them will  be  pulled 
by  the  applied  electric  field  across  the  junction  before  recombining  with  a  positive  ion.    This 
flow  of  electrons  (opposite  to  current  flow)  is  indicated  by  the  larger  white  arrow,  and  is 
proportional  to  that  fraction  of P{E}  that  lies  beyond  the  small  energy  gap  separating  the Fermi 
level  and  the  lower  edge  of  the  conduction  band.   Holes  in  the  valence  band  can  also  contribute 
significantly  to  this  current.   The  integral over  energy of  the  exponential probability distribution 
P{E}  above  threshold  Eg  -  v  is  another  exponential  for  0  <  v  <  Eg, which  is  proportional  to  the 
population  of  conducting  electrons,  and  which  approximates  the  i(v)  relation  for  a  p-n  junction 
illustrated in Figure 8.2.1(a) for v > 0. 

- 247 -


Transistors  are  semiconductor  devices  configured  so  that  the  number  of  carriers  (electrons 
plus holes) available in a junction to support conductivity is controlled 1) by the number injected 
into the junction by a p-n interface biased so as to inject the desired number (e.g., as is done in p-
n-p  or  n-p-n  transistors),  or  2)  by  the  carriers  present  that  have  not  been  pulled  to  one  side  or 
trapped  by  electric  fields  (e.g.,  field-effect  transistors). 
In  general,  small  bias  currents  and 
voltages  can  thereby  control  the  current  flowing  across  much  larger  voltage  gaps  with  power 
amplification  factors  of  100  or more.    Although  the  range  of  device  designs  is  very  large, most 
can  be  understood  semi-classically  as  suggested  above,  without  the  full  quantum  mechanical 
descriptions needed for precise characterization. 

The  response  time  of  p-n  junctions  and  transistors  is  usually  determined  by  either  the  RC, 
RL, or LC  time constants  that  limit  the  rise and  fall  times of voltages and currents applied  to  the 
device  terminals, or by  the  field  relaxation  time ε/σ  (4.3.3) of  the semiconductor material within 
the  device  itself.  In  extremely  fast  devices  the  response  time  sometimes  is  τ ≅ D/v, where D  is 
the  junction  dimension  [m]  of  interest,  and  v  is  the  velocity  of  light  (v  =  [με]-0.5)  or  of  the 
transiting electrons ( v = ∫ a dt , f = ma = eE). 

Although  these  physical  models  for  semiconductor  junctions  are  relatively  primitive,  they 
do approximately explain most phenomena. 

Example 8.2B 
What  are  the  approximate  temperature  dependences  of  the  currents  flowing  in  forward-  and 
reverse-biased p-n junctions? 

Solution: 	

If  the  bias  voltage  exceeds  the  gap  voltage,  and  kT  is  large  compared  to  the  energy 
gap  between  the  donor  level  and  the  conduction  band,  then  essentially  all  donors  are 
ionized  and  further  temperature  changes  have  little  effect  on  forward  biased  p-n 
junctions;  see  Figure  8.2.3(f).  The  carrier  concentration  in  reverse-biased  diodes  is

8.3  Distortions due to loss and dispersion 

8.3.1  Lossy transmission lines 

In most electronic systems transmission line loss is a concern because business strategy generally 
dictates  reducing wire  diameters  and  costs  until  such  issues  arise.    For  example,  the  polysilicon 
often used for conductors in integrated silicon devices has noticeable resistance. 

The TEM circuit model of Figure 8.3.1 incorporates two types of loss.  The series resistance 
R per meter arises from the finite conductivity of the wires, while the parallel conductance G per 
meter  arises  from  leakage  currents  flowing  between  the  wires  through  the  medium  separating 
them.

(8.3.2) 

If  the wires  are  resistive,  then  current  flowing  through  them  introduces  longitudinal  electric 
fields  Ez,  violating  the  TEM  assumption:  Ez  =  Hz  =  0.  Since  rigorous  solution  of  Maxwell’s 
equations for the non-TEM case is challenging, the telegraphers’ equations are often used instead 
if  the  loss  is  modest.    The  same  problem  does  not  arise  with  G  because  it  does  not  violate  the 
TEM  assumption,  as  shown  in  Section  7.1.3.    Since  propagation  in  such  lossy  TEM  lines  is 
frequency  dependent,  the  telegraphers’  equations  (8.3.1–2)  and  their  solutions  are  generally 
expressed using complex notation45: 

dV z   dz  = −( R + j ωL )I (z )

equation for  lossy TEM  lines, where  the sign of k2  is chosen so  that k  is real, consistent with  the 
lossless solutions discussed earlier in Section 7.1.2:

(8.3.9)

When R = G = 0, (8.3.9) reduces to the well known result Zo = (L/C)0.5. 

Thus  two  new  properties  emerge when  TEM  lines  are  dissipative:  1)  because  k  is  complex 
and a non-linear function of frequency, waves are attenuated and dispersed as they propagate in a 
frequency-dependent  manner,  and  2)  Zo  is  complex  and  frequency  dependent.  Both  k'  and  k" 
(8.3.6)  are  functions  of  frequency,  so  signals  propagating  on  lossy  lines  change  shape,  partly 
because  different  frequency  components  propagate  and  decay  differently.    The  resulting 
attenuation  and  dispersion  are  discussed  in  Sections  8.3.1  and  8.3.2,  respectively.    Reflections 
are  affected  at  junctions  by  losses,  and  also  are  attenuated  with  distance  so  the  impedance  of  a 
lossy  line  Z(z)  → Zo  regardless  of  load  as  V-(z)  becomes  negligible.    Reflections  by  junctions 
involving  lossy  lines  are  simply  analyzed  by  replacing  Zo  by  a  complex  impedance  Zo  in  the 
expressions developed in Section 7.2 for lossless lines. 

Waves propagating only in the +z direction obey (8.3.7), which becomes:

One  combination  of  R,  L,  C,  and  G  is  particularly  interesting  because  it  results  in  zero 
dispersion  and  a  frequency-independent  decay  that  does  not  distort  waveforms.    We  may 
discover this combination by evaluating k using (8.3.6):

It  follows  from  (8.3.11)  that  if R/L = G/C,  then  the  phase  velocity  (vp  = ω/k' =  [LC]-0.5)  and  the 
decay rate (k" = R[C/L]0.5) are both frequency independent:

The  ability  to  avoid  signal  distortion  due  to  frequency-dependent  absorption  was  first 
exploited  by  telephone  companies  who  added  small  inductors  periodically  in  series  with  their 
longer  phone  lines  in  order  to  reduce  R/L  so  that  it  balanced  G/C;  the  result  was  called  a

distortionless  line,  and  the  coils  are  called  Pupin  coils  after  their  inventor46.  The  consequences 
of dispersion are explored in Section 8.3.2. 

Another  limit  is  sometimes  of  interest  when  the  effects  of  R  dominate  those  of  ωL.  This 
occurs,  for  example,  in  resistive  polysilicon  or  diffusion  lines  in  integrated  circuits,  which  may 
be approximately modeled by eliminating L and G from Figure 8.3.1.  Then k (8.3.11) becomes:

  2 )0.5  = k '− jk '' 
k ≅ −(  j ωRC  )  = (ωRC 

(8.3.13) 

The  square  root  of  -j  was  chosen  to  correspond  to  a  decaying  wave  rather  than  to  exponential 
growth.  The phase and group velocities for this line are the same:

Although  it  is  not  easy  to  relate  these  frequency-dependent  velocities  to  delays  in  digital 
circuits,  they demonstrate  that such delays exist and express  their dependence on R and C.   That 
is,  larger  line  time  constants RC  lower  pulse  velocities  and  increase  delays.    Such  lines  are  best 
used  when  they  are  short  compared  to  the  shortest  wavelength  of  interest,  D  <  λ =  vp/fmax  = 
2π(2/rcωmax)0.5.  In  polysilicon  lines  λmin  ≅  1  mm  for  ωmax  =  1010.  The  response  to  arbitrary 
waveform  excitation  can  be  computed  by:  1)  Fourier  transforming  the  signal,  2)  propagating 
each  frequency  component  as  dictated  by  (8.3.13),  and  then  3)  reconstructing  the  signal  at  the 
new  location  with  an  inverse  Fourier  transform.    Typical  values  for  R  and  C  in  metal, 
polysilicon,  and  diffusion  lines  are  presented  in  Table  8.3.1,  and  correspond  to  velocities  much 
less than c.  The costs of these three options for forming conductors are unequal and must also be 
considered when designing fast integrated circuits.

46 Pupin coils had to be inserted at least every λ/10 meters in order to avoid additional distortions, but the shortest λ 
for telephone voice signals is ~c/f = 3×108/3000 = 100 km.

8.3.2  Dispersive transmission lines 

Different  frequency  components  propagate  at  different  velocities  on  dispersive  transmission 
lines. The nature and consequences of dispersion are discussed further in Section 9.5.2.  Consider 
first a square-wave computer clock pulse at F Hz propagating along a dispersive TEM  line.   The 
Fourier  transform of  this  signal has  its  fundamental  at F Hz, with odd harmonics  at 3F, 5F,  etc., 
each of which has its own phase velocity, as suggested in Figure 8.3.2.

Significant pulse distortion occurs  if a strong harmonic  is shifted as much as ~90o  relative  to  the 
fundamental.    To  determine  the  relative  phase  shift  between  fundamental  and  harmonic  we  can 
first multiply the difference in phase velocity at F and 3F, e.g., vpF - vp3F, by the propagation time 
T  of  interest.   This  yields  the  spatial  offset  between  these  two  harmonics, which we might  limit 
to λ/4 for 3F.  That is, we might expect significant distortion over a transmission line of length D 
= vpT meters if:   
(vpF − vp3F )T > ~ λ3F  4 = vp3F  (4 × 3F
)

(8.3.17) 

 

There  is  a  similar  limit  to  the  propagation  distance  of  narrowband  pulse  signals  before 
waveform  distortion  becomes  unacceptable.    Digital  communications  systems  commonly  use 
narrowband  pulses  s(t)  for  both  wireless  and  cable  signaling.    For  example,  the  square  wave  in 
Figure  8.3.2  could  also  represent  the  amplitude  envelope  A(t)  =  Σi  ai  cosωit  of  an  underlying 
sinusoid cosωot, where ωo >> ωi>0 and together they occupy a narrow bandwidth.  That is: 
o	 t ) ∑ a i cos ωi t = 0.5 ∑ a i {cos  (ωo + ωi ) t + cos ⎡⎣

(8.3.18)

Since each frequency ωo±ωi propagates at a slightly different phase velocity, a narrowband pulse 
will  also  distort  when  a  strong  harmonic  is  ~λ/4  out  of  phase  relative  to  the  original  wave 
envelope, which  is much  larger  than λ =  2πc/ωo  for  narrowband  signals.  Some  applications  are 
more  sensitive  to  dispersive  distortion  than  others;  for  example,  distorted  digital  signals  can  be

generally be  regenerated distortion  free, while analog signals  require  inverse distortion, which  is 
often uneconomic. 

Distortion  of  narrowband  signals  is  usually  computed  in  terms  of  the  group  velocity  vg, 
which is the velocity of propagation for the waveform envelope and equals the velocity of energy 
or  information,  which  can  never  exceed  c,  the  velocity  of  light  in  vacuum.    The  sine  wave  that 
characterizes  the  average  frequency  of  a  narrowband  pulse  propagates  at  the  phase  velocity  vp, 
which  can  be  greater  or  less  than  c.  Narrowband  pulse  signals  (e.g.,  digitally  modulated 
sinusoids)  distort  when  the  accumulated  difference  Δ  in  the  envelope  propagation  distances 
between  the  high-  and  low-frequency  end  of  the  signal  spectrum  differs  by  more  than  a  small 
fraction  of  the  minimum  pulse  width  W[m]  (e.g.,  the  length  of  a  zero  or  one).    Since  the 
difference  in  group  velocity  across  the  bandwidth B[Hz]  is  (∂vg/∂f)B  [m/s],  and  the  pulse  travel 
time  is  D/vg,  where  D  is  propagation  distance,  it  follows  that  the  difference  in  envelope 
propagation distance across the band is: 
∂vg  BD  [
Δ = 
∂f  vg

Since  the  minimum  pulse  width W  is  ~vg/B  [m],  the  requirement  that  D  << W  implies  that  the 
maximum distortion-free propagation distance D is:

Group  and  phase  velocity  are  discussed  further  in  Section  9.5.2  and  their  effect  on  distortion  is 
explored in Section 12.2.2. 

Example 8.3A 
Typical 50-ohm coaxial cables for home distribution of television and internet signals have series 
0.5)  ohms  m-1.  Assume  ε  =  4εo,  μ  =  μo.  How  far  can  signals  propagate 
resistance  R  ≅  0.02(fMHz
before attenuating 60 dB? 

Solution:  	 Since  conductivity  G  ≅  0,  (8.3.11)  says  k  =  ω[LC(1  -  jR/ωL)]0.5  =  k'  +  jk".    The 
imaginary part of k corresponds to exponential decay.  For R << ωL, k ≅ ω(LC)0.5(1 -
jR/ωL)0.5,  so  k"  =  -(ωRC)0.5.  To  find  C  we  note  the  phase  velocity  v  =  (μo4εo)-0.5  = 
(LC)-0.5  =  c/2  ≅  1.5×108  [m  s-1],  and  Zo  =  50  =  (L/C)0.5.   Therefore  C  =  2/cZo  = 
2/(3×108×50)  ≅  1.33×10-10  [F].
  Thus  at  100  MHz,  k"  =  -(ωRC)0.5  = 
-(2π108×0.2×1.33×10-10)0.5 ≅ -0.017.  Since power decays as e-2k"z, 60 dB corresponds 
to  e-2k"z  =  10-6,  so  z  =  -ln(10-6)/2k"  =  406 meters.   At  100 MHz  the  approximation R 
<<  ωL  is  quite  valid.  As  coaxial  cable  systems  boost  data  rates  and  their maximum 
frequency  above  100-200  MHz,  the  increased  attenuation  requires  amplifiers  at 
intervals so short as  to motivate switching  to optical  fibers  that can propagate signals 
hundred of kilometers without amplification.
