Chapter 6:  Actuators and Sensors, Motors and Generators 

6.1 

Force-induced electric and magnetic fields 

6.1.1 

Introduction 

Chapter 5 explained how electric and magnetic  fields could exert  force on charges, currents, and 
media, and how electrical power  into such devices could be  transformed  into mechanical power. 
Chapter  6  explores  several  types  of  practical  motors  and  actuators  built  using  these  principles, 
where  an  actuator  is  typically  a  motor  that  throws  a  switch  or  performs  some  other  brief  task 
from time to time.  Chapter 6 also explores the reverse transformation, where mechanical motion 
alters  electric  or  magnetic  fields  and  converts  mechanical  to  electrical  power.    Absent  losses, 
conversions to electrical power can be nearly perfect and find application in electrical generators 
and mechanical sensors. 

Section  6.1.2  first  explores  how  mechanical  motion  of  conductors  or  charges  through 
magnetic  fields  can  generate  voltages  that  can  be  tapped  for  power.    Two  charged  objects  can 
also  be  forcefully  separated,  lengthening  the  electric  field  lines  connecting  them  and  thereby 
increasing  their  voltage  difference,  where  this  increased  voltage  can  be  tapped  for  purposes  of 
sensing  or  electrical  power  generation.    Section  6.1.3  then  shows  in  the  context  of  a  current-
carrying wire in a magnetic field how power conversion can occur in either direction. 

6.1.2  Motion-induced voltages 

Any  conductor moving  across magnetic  field  lines  acquires  an  open-circuit  voltage  that  follows 
directly from the Lorentz force law (6.1.1)18: 

f = q(E + v ×  μ oH) 

(6.1.1)
 

Consider the electron illustrated in Figure 6.1.1, which has charge –e and velocity⎯v.

18 Some  textbooks present alternative explanations  that  lead  to  the same  results.   The explanation here views matter 
as  composed  of  charged  particles  governed  electromagnetically  solely  by  the  Lorentz  force  law,  and  other  forces, 
such as the Kelvin force densities acting on media discussed in Section 4.5, are derived from it.

It  is moving  perpendicular  to  H   and  therefore  experiences  a  Lorentz  force  on  it  of  −
×ev μ o H .
It  experiences  that  force  even  inside  a  moving  wire  and  will  accelerate  in  response  to  it.    This 
force  causes  all  free  electrons  inside  the  conductor  to  move  until  the  resulting  surface  charges 
produce an equilibrium electric field distribution such that the net force on any electron is zero. 

In  the  case  of  a  moving  open-circuited  wire,  the  free  charges  (electrons)  will  move  inside 
the wire and accumulate  toward  its ends until  there  is sufficient electric potential across  the wire 
to  halt  their  movement  everywhere.    Specifically,  this  Lorentz  force  balance  requires  that  the 
force  -eE e on  the  electrons  due  to  the  resulting  electric  field⎯Ee  be  equal  and  opposite  to  those
due to the magnetic field  -ev × μ oH , that is: 

−

×ev   μo H  = eE   e

Therefore the equilibrium electric field inside the wire must be: 

E e = − v  × μ o H 

(6.1.2)
 

(6.1.3)
 

There should be no confusion about  Ee  being non-zero inside a conductor.  It is the net force on 
free  electrons  that  must  be  zero  in  equilibrium,  not  the  electric  field  Ee .  The  electric  Lorentz 
force  qEe   must  balance  the  magnetic  Lorentz  force  or  otherwise  the  charges  will  experience  a 
net force that continues to move them until there is such balance. 

Figure 6.1.2 illustrates such a wire of length W moving at velocity  v  perpendicular to  H .

If the wire were open-circuited, the potential Φ across it would be the integral of the electric field 
necessary to cancel the magnetic forces on the electrons, where: 

Φ =  μ ov HW

(6.1.4) 

and  the signs and directions are as  indicated  in  the  figure.   We assume  that  the  fields, wires, and 
velocity  v   in  the  figure  are  all  orthogonal  so  that  v × μo H   contributes  no  potential  differences 
except along the wire of length W.

Example 6.1A 
A  large  metal  airplane  flies  at  300  m  s-1  relative  to  a  vertical  terrestrial  magnetic  field  of  ~10-4 
Teslas (1 gauss).  What is the open-circuit voltage V wingtip to wingtip if the wingspan W is ~40 
meters?  If  B  points upwards, is the right wing positive or negative? 

Solution:  The electric field induced inside the metal is  − ×v μ o H  (4.3.2), so the induced voltage 
V  =  WvμoH  ≅  40×300×1.26×10-6×10-4  ≅  1.5×10-6  volts,  and  the  right  wingtip  is 
positive. 

6.1.3 

Induced currents and back voltages 

If  the moving wire of Figure 6.1.2  is connected  to a  load R,  then current I will  flow as governed 
by Ohm’s law.  I depends on 
Φ, R, and the illustrated Thevenin voltage V: 

I = ( V − Φ )

 R = ( V − v μ oHW  
) R 

(6.1.5)
 

The  current  can  be  positive  or  negative,  depending  on  the  relative  values  of  V  and  the  motion-
induced  voltage  Φ.  From  (5.2.7)  we  see  that  the  magnetic  force  density  on  the  wire  is 
-1
  [Nm ].  The  associated  total  force  f be  exerted  on  the wire  by  the  environment  and

where the unit vector  xˆ  is parallel to  v . 

Equation  (6.1.6)  enables  us  to  compute  the  mechanical  power  delivered  to  the  wire  by  the 
environment (Pbe) or, in the reverse direction, by the wire to the environment (Poe), where Pbe = -
Poe.  If  the  voltage  source  V  is  sufficiently  great,  then  the  system  functions  as  a  motor  and  the

(6.1.8) 

The negative sign in the first term of (6.1.8) is associated with the direction of I defined in Figure 
6.1.2;  I  flows  out  of  the Thevenin  circuit while  Pe  flows  in.    If V  is  zero,  then  the wire  delivers 
maximum  power,  Φ2/R.    As  V  increases,  this  delivered  power  diminishes  and  then  becomes 
negative as the system ceases to be an electrical generator and becomes a motor.  As a motor the 

- 153 -


	
mechanical power delivered  to  the wire by  the environment becomes negative, and  the electrical 
power delivered by the Thevenin source becomes positive.  That is, we have a: 

Motor:	

If mechanical power out Poe > 0, 
V > Φ = vμoHW, or v < V/μoHW 

Generator: 	

If electrical power out Pe > 0, 
V < Φ, or v > V/μoHW 

(6.1.9) 

(6.1.10) 

  We call Φ  the “back voltage” of a motor;  it  increases as  the motor velocity v  increases until 
it  equals  the voltage V of  the power  source  and Pe = 0.  If  the velocity  increases  further  so  that 
 
Φ  >  V,  the  motor  becomes  a  generator.    When  V  =  Φ,  then  I  =  0  and  the  motor  moves  freely 
without any electromagnetic forces. 

This basic coupling mechanism between magnetic and mechanical forces and powers can be 
utilized in many configurations, as discussed further below. 

Example 6.1B 
A  straight wire  is drawn  at velocity v =  xˆ 10 m  s-1 between  the poles of  a 0.1-Tesla magnet;  the 
velocity  vector, wire  direction,  and  field  direction  are  all  orthogonal  to  each  other.    The wire  is 
externally connected to a resistor R = 10-5 ohms.  What mechanical force⎯f is exerted on the wire 
by the magnetic field⎯B?  The geometry is illustrated in Figure 6.1.2. 

Solution:	 The force exerted on the wire by its magnetic environment (6.1.6) is 
⎯fbe =⎯ I  ×⎯HμoW [N], where the induced current I = -Φ/R and the back voltage 
Φ = vμoHW [V].  Therefore: 
fbe = - xˆ μoHWΦ/R = - xˆ v(μoHW)2/R = - xˆ 10×(0.1×0.1)2/10-5 = 1 [N], opposite to⎯v.

Electrostatic actuators and motors 

6.2.1 

Introduction to Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) 

Chapter  6  elaborates  on  Chapter  5  by  exploring  a  variety  of  motors,  generators,  and  sensors  in 
both  linear  and  rotary  configurations.    Electric  examples  are  analyzed  in  Section  6.2,  and 
magnetic  examples  in  Section  6.3.    Section  6.2.1  reviews  the  background,  while  Sections  6.2.2 
and  6.2.3  explore  parallel-capacitor-plate  devices  using  linear  and  rotary  motion  respectively. 
Section  6.2.4  discusses  electrostatic  motors  exerting  forces  on  dielectrics,  while  Section  6.2.5 
discusses  the  limits  to power density posed by electrical breakdown of air or other media, which 
limits peak electric field strength. 

Micro-electromechanical  systems  (MEMS)  are  commonly  used  as  motors,  generators, 
actuators, and sensors and underlie one of the major current revolutions in electrical engineering, 
namely  the  extension  of  integrated  circuit  fabrication  technology  to  electromechanical  systems 
on the same substrate as the circuits with which they interoperate.  Such devices now function as 

- 154 -


optical switches, radio-frequency switches, microphones, accelerometers, thermometers, pressure 
sensors,  chemical  sensors,  micro-fluidic  systems,  electrostatic  and  magnetic  motors,  biological 
sensors,  and other devices.  They  are used  in  systems  as diverse as video projectors,  automobile 
air bag triggers, and mechanical digital memories for hot environments. 

Advantages  of  MEMS  over  their  larger  counterparts  include  size,  weight,  power 
consumption,  and  cost,  and  also  much  increased  speed  due  to  the  extremely  small  masses  and 
distances  involved.  For  example,  some MEMS  electromechanical  switches  can  operate  at MHz 
frequencies,  compared  to  typical  speeds  below  ~1  kHz  for most  traditional mechanical  devices. 
The  feature  size  of MEMS  ranges  from  sub-microns  or microns  up  to  one  or more millimeters, 
although  the basic electromagnetic principles apply  to devices of any  scale.   Recent advances  in 
micro-fabrication  techniques,  such  as  new  lithography  and  etching  techniques,  precision  micro-
molds,  and  improved  laser  cutting  and  chipping  tools,  have  simplified MEMS  development  and 
extended their capabilities. 

The  Lorentz  force  law  (6.2.1)  is  fundamental  to  all  electric  and  magnetic  motors  and 
generators  and  expresses  the  force  vector  f  [Newtons]  acting  on  a  charge  q  [Coulombs]  as  a 
function of the local electric field  E , magnetic field  H , and charge velocity vector  v  [ms-1]: 

f

q E( + v × μo H )  [Newtons]
= 

(6.2.1) 

For  the  examples  in  Section  6.2  the  velocities  v   and  magnetic  fields H   are  negligible,  so  the 
force  is  primarily  electrostatic,  f
E  is 
qE ,  and  can  be  readily  found  if  E  is  known.  When 
= 
unknown,  the energy method of Section 5.4.2 can often be used  instead, as  illustrated  later.   The 
power  densities  achievable  in  MEMS  devices  can  be  quite  high,  and  are  typically  limited  by 
materials failures, such as electrical breakdown or ohmic overheating. 

6.2.2  Electrostatic actuators 

The  simplest  MEMS  actuators  use  the  electric  force  between  two  capacitor  plates  to  pull  them 
together,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6.2.1(a)  for  a  cantilevered  loudspeaker  or  switch.    The  Lorentz 
force  density  F  [N  m-2]  attracting  the  two  plates  is  given  by  the  qE   term  in  (6.2.1).    Although 
one  might  suppose  the  force  density  on  the  upper  plate  is  simply  ρsE,  where  ρs  is  the  surface 
charge  density  [C  m-2]  on  that  plate,  the  correct  force  is  half  this  value  because  those  charges 
nearer the surface screen those behind, as suggested in Figure 6.2.1(b); the charges furthest from 
the surface perceive almost no  E  at all.  The figure shows a one-to-one correspondence between 
electric  field  lines  and  charges  in  a  highly  idealized  distribution—reality  is  more  random.   The 
figure  shows  that  the  average  field  strength  E  perceived  by  the  charges  is  half  the  surface  field 
Eo, independent of their depth distribution ρ(z).  Therefore the total attractive electric pressure is: 

Pe  = ρs ( Eo  2 )  ⎣⎡Nm−2 ⎦⎤

If Eo  is  near  its  breakdown  value E
B  ≅ 10 [V m ]  for  gaps  less  than ~10  meters,  then  the 
 
o /2  ≅  8.8×10-12×1016/2  =  4.4×104  [N  m-2].  A  Newton  is  approximately  the 
pressure  P  =  εoE 2
gravitational  force  on  the  apple  that  fell  on Newton’s  head  (prompting  his  theory  of  gravity),  or 
on  a  quarter-pound  of  butter.  Therefore  this  maximum  electrostatic  force  density  is  about  one 
pound per square centimeter, comparable to that of a strong magnet. 

The  cantilever  acts  like  a  spring  with  a  spring  constant  k,  so  the  total  force  f  is  simply 
related  to  the  deflection  x:  f  =  kx  =  PA,  where  A  is  the  area  of  the  capacitor  plate.   Thus  the 
deflection is:

[

]
m 
 

(6.2.5)

The  ratio  A/k  is  controlled  by  the  composition,  thickness,  and  length  of  the  cantilever,  and  the 
desired deflection is controlled by the application.  For example, k must be adequate to overcome 
stiction19  in  switches  that  make  and  break  contact,  and  x  must  be  adequate  to  ensure  that  the 
voltage between the capacitor plates does not cause arcing when the switch is open. 

Alternatively  both  capacitor  plates  could  be  charged  positive  or  negative  so  they  repel  each 
other.  In  this  case  the  charge  Q  moves  to  the  outside  surfaces  and  connects  to  the  very  same 
field  strengths  as  before  due  to  boundary  conditions  (E  =  Q/εoA)  ,  except  that  the  negative 
pressure εoE2/2 on  the  two plates acts  to pull  them apart  rather  than  together.   The  field between 
the plates is then zero. 

19 Stiction  is  the  force  that must be overcome when  separating  two contacting surfaces.   These  forces often become 
important for micron-sized objects, particularly for good conductors in contact for long periods.

Even  with  extreme  electric  field  strengths  the  power  density  [W  m-3]  available  with  linear 
motion  MEMS  actuators  may  be  insufficient.    Power  equals  force  times  velocity,  and  rotary 
velocities  can  be much  greater  than  linear  velocities  in  systems  with  limited  stroke,  such  as  the 
cantilever of Figure 6.2.1(a) or the lateral-displacement systems illustrated in Figure 6.2.2.  Since 
it  is  difficult  to  compute  the  lateral  electric  fields  responsible  for  the  lateral  forces  in  rotary  or 
linear  systems  [e.g.,  the  z  components  in  Figure  6.2.2(a)],  the  energy  methods  described  below 
are generally used instead.

f 

The  two  charged parallel plates  illustrated  in Figure 6.2.2(a)  are pulled  laterally  toward one 
another  (z  increases)  because  opposite  charges  attract.  The  force⎯f  required  to  pull  the  plates 
apart depends only on their electric charge q and the plate geometry, independent of any attached 
circuit.    This  force⎯f  in  the  -z  direction  can  be  found  by  noting  that  f  does  work  on  the 
capacitor/circuit system, increasing its total energy wT if f is positive: 

f = - dwT/dz = - dwe/dz - V dq/dz  [N] 

(energy-force equation) 

(6.2.6) 

where  we  is  the  electric  energy  stored  in  the  capacitor,  V  is  the  capacitor  voltage20,  and  dq  is 
incremental  charge  flowing  from  any  attached  circuit  into  the  positive  terminal  of  the  capacitor. 
The  negative  sign  in  (6.2.6)  results  because  f  is  in  the  -z  direction.    Since  this  energy-force 
equation  is  correct  regardless  of  any  attached  circuit,  we  can  evaluate  it  for  an  attached  open 
circuit,  battery,  or  arbitrary  Thevenin  equivalent,  provided  it  results  in  the  given  capacitor 
voltage V and charge q. 

The  force  computed  using  (6.2.6)  is  the  same  for  any  attached  circuit  and  any  form  of  the 
energy expression (3.1.16): 

we = CV2/2 = q2/2C  [J] 

(electric energy in a capacitor) 

(6.2.7) 

The  algebra  is  minimized,  however,  if  we  assume  the  capacitor  is  open-circuit  so  that  q  is 
constant and dq/dz = 0  in  (6.2.6).   Because V depends on z  in  this case,  it  is simpler  to use we = 
q2/2C to evaluate (6.2.6), where: 1) C = εoWz/s [F], 2) the overlap area of the capacitor is Wz, 3) 
the plate separation is s << W, and 4) we neglect fringing fields.  Thus (6.2.6) becomes: 

f = - (q2/2) (dC-1/dz) = - (q2/2)(s/ε W)dz-1/dz = (q2

/2)(s/εoWz )  [N] 

(6.2.8) 

20 For convenience, V represents voltage and v represents velocity in this section. 

- 157 -


The rapid increase in force as z → 0 results because q is constant and concentrates at the ends of 
the  plates  as  the  overlap  approaches  zero;  z→0  also  violates  the  assumption  that  fringing  fields 
can be neglected. 

It is interesting to relate the force f of (6.2.8) to the electric field strength E, where: 

E = ρs/εo = q/Wzεo  [V m-1] 

q = WzεoE = WzεoV/s  [C]

(6.2.10) 

f = q2s/2εoWz2 = WsεoE2/2 = A'Pe  [N] 

(lateral electric force) 

(6.2.11) 

where A' = Ws  is  the cross-sectional area of  the gap perpendicular  to⎯f, and Pe = ΔWe = εoE2/2 ­
0  is  the  electric  pressure  difference  acting  at  the  end  of  the  capacitor.   Note  that  this  pressure  is 
perpendicular to⎯E and is “pushing” into the adjacent field-free region where We = 0; in contrast, 
the  pressure  parallel  to⎯E  always  “pulls”.  Later  we  shall  find  that  “magnetic  pressure”  Pm  = 
ΔWm is similarly attractive parallel to⎯H and pushes in directions orthogonal to⎯H. 

Note that if V is constant, then the force f (6.2.11) does not depend on z and is maximized as 
s→0.  For  a  fixed  V,  the  minimum  practical  plate  separation  s  corresponds  to  E  near  the 
threshold of electrical breakdown, which is discussed further in Section 6.2.5.  Also note that the 
force  f  is  proportional  to  W,  which  can  be  maximized  using  multiple  fingers  similar  to  those 
illustrated  in  Figure  6.2.2(b).    Actuator  and  motor  designs  generally  maximize  f  and  W  while 
preserving the desired stroke21. 

Example 6.2A 
Design a small electrostatic overlapping plate linear actuator that opens a  latch by moving 1 mm 
with a force of 10-2 Newtons. 

Solution:	 The  two-plate  actuator  illustrated  in  Figure  6.2.2(a)  exerts  a  force  f  =  WsεoE2 
If  E  is  near  the  maximum  dry-gas  value  of  ~3.2×106  V  m-1,  the  gap 
(6.2.11). 
s  =  1  mm,  and W  =  1  cm,  then  f  =  10-2×10-3×8.85×10-12×1013  =  8.85×10-4  [N].  By 
using M  fingers,  each  wider  than  the  1-mm  stroke,  the  force  can  be  increased  by M 
[see Figure 6.2.2(b)].  If we  let M = 12  the device yields  f = 1.06×10-2, but  its  length 
L must  be  greater  than  12  times  twice  the  finger width  (see  figure), where  the  finger 
width  G  must  exceed  not  only  the  stroke  but  also  several  times  s,  in  order  to  make 
fringing fields negligible.  If G ≅ 4 mm,  then  the actuator  length  is 12×2×4 mm = 9.6 
cm,  large compared  to  the width.   A  three-plate actuator with  two grounded plates on 
the  outside  and  one  charged  plate  inside would  double  the  force,  halve  the  length  L, 
protect  users  from  electrocution,  and  simplify  sealing  the  actuator  against  moisture 

21
  The  “stroke”  of  an  actuator  is  its  range  of  positions;  in  Figure  6.2.2(a)  it  would  be  the  maximum  minus  the 
minimum value of z.  Although the force (6.2.11) becomes infinite as the minimum z → 0 for constant q, this would 
violate the assumption z >> d and can cause V→∞; V is usually held constant, however.

that  could  short-circuit  the  plates.  The  plate  voltage  V  =  Es  =  3200  volts.    This 
design is not unique, of course. 

6.2.3  Rotary electrostatic motors 

Because  forces  (6.2.4)  or  (6.2.11)  in  electrostatic  motors  are  limited  by  the  maximum  electric 
field  strength  E  possible  without  electric  arcing,  higher  power  densities  [W  m-3]  require  higher 
speeds since the power P = fv [watts], where f is force [N], and v is velocity [m s-1].  Figure 6.2.3 
pictures  an  ideal  4-segment  rotary  electrostatic  motor  for  which  v  and  the  resulting  centrifugal 
forces  are  ultimately  limited  by  the  tensile  strength  of  the  rotor.    For  both  materials  and 
aerodynamic  reasons  the maximum  v  at  the  rotor  tip  is  usually  somewhat  less  than  the  speed  of 
sound,  ~340  m/s.    Some  rotors  spin  much  faster  in  vacuum  if  the  material  can  withstand  the 
centrifugal force.

rotate  to  yield  an  overlap  area  A  =  R2θ [m2]  that  varies  from  zero  to  πR2/2  as  θ  increases  from 
zero to π/2.  If the voltage V is applied across the plates, a torque T is produced22, where: 

T = −dw

(6.2.12) 

and dwT  is  the  increment by which  the  total  system energy  (fields plus battery)  is  increased as a 
result of the motion dθ.  The negative sign in (6.2.12) reflects the fact that the torque T is applied 
by  the  motor  to  the  environment.    If  we  replace  the  overlap  area  of  Wz  in  (6.2.8)  by  its 
equivalent R2θ, then (6.2.8) and (6.2.12) become:

22 Torque T [Nm] equals  the force f on a  lever  times  its  length L.   Therefore  the mechanical work performed by  the 
torque is wm = fx = fL(x/L) = Tθ, where θ = x/L is the angle (radians) through which the lever rotates about its pivot 
at one end.  Power is Tdθ/dt = Tω [W].

where Q = εoR2θV/s [C], which follows from (6.2.10) where Wz → R2θ [m2]. 

If  we  assume  R  =  10-3,  s =  10-6,  and  V  =  3  volts  (corresponding  to  3×106  Vm-1,  below  the 
breakdown limit discussed in Section 6.2.5; then (6.2.14) yields: 

T = 8.8×10-12×(10-3)232/10-6  ≅ 7.9×10-11  [N m] 

(6.2.15) 

This  torque  exists  only  until  the  plates  fully  overlap,  at which  time  the  voltage V  is  switched  to 
zero until the plates coast another 90° and V is restored.  The duty cycle of this motor is thus 0.5 
because T ≠ 0 only half of the time. 

A  single  such  ideal  motor  can  then  deliver  an  average  of  Tω/2  watts,  where  the  factor  ½ 
reflects  the  duty  cycle,  and  Tω  is  the  mechanical  power  associated  with  torque  T  on  a  shaft 
rotating at ω radians s-1.  If the tip velocity v of this rotor is 300 ms-1, slightly less than the speed 
of  sound  so  as  to  reduce  drag  losses  while  maximizing  ω,  then  the  corresponding  angular 
velocity ω  is v/R = 300/10-3 = 3×105  radians  s-1 or ~3×106  rpm, and  the available power Tω/2 ≅ 
7.9×10-11  ×  3×105/2  ≅  1.2×10-5  watts  if  we  neglect  all  losses.    In  principle  one  might  pack 
~25,000  motors  into  one  cubic  centimeter  if  each  motor  were  10  microns  thick,  yielding 
~0.3 W/cm3.  By using a motor with N segments instead of 4 this power density and torque could 
be  increased by a factor of N/4.   The small micron-sized gap s would permit values of N as high 
as ~500 before the fringing fields become important, and power densities of ~40 W/cm-3. 

This  40-W/cm3  power  density  can  be  compared  to  that  of  a  200-hp  automobile  engine  that 
 
delivers 200×746 watts23 and occupies 0.1 m3, yielding only ~1.5 W/cm3.  Extremely high power 
densities  are  practical  only  in  tiny  MEMS  devices  because  heat  and  torque  are  then  easier  to 
remove,  and  because  only  micron-scale  gaps  permit  the  highest  field  strengths,  as  explained  in 
Section 6.2.5.  Rotary MEMS motors have great potential  for  extremely  low power  applications 
where  torque  extraction  can  be  efficient;  examples  include  drivers  for  micro-gas-turbines  and 
pumps.  The field of MEMS motors is still young, so their full potential remains unknown. 

6.2.4  Dielectric actuators and motors 

One difficulty with the rotary motor of Figure 6.2.3 is that voltage must be applied to the moving 
vanes across a sliding mechanical boundary.  One alternative is to use a dielectric rotor driven by 
voltages applied only to the stator.  The configuration could be similar to that of Figure 6.2.3 but 
the  rotor would  be  dielectric  and mounted  between  identical  conducting  stators with  a  potential 
V between them that is turned on and off at times so as to produce an average torque as the rotor 
rotates.  Figure 6.2.4 illustrates the concept in terms of a linear actuator for which the force f can 
more easily be found.  We again assume that fringing fields can be neglected because W >> d. 

23 There are 746 watts per horsepower.

The force f can be found by differentiating the total stored electric energy we with respect to 
motion z, where C is the effective capacitance of this structure, and: 

we =  CV2/2 = Q2/2C  [J] 

(6.2.16) 

To  simplify  differentiating  we  with  respect  to  z,  it  is  easier  to  use  the  expression  we  =  Q2/2C 
because is this case Q is independent of z whereas C is not. 

For  two  capacitors  in  parallel  C  =  Co  +  Cε  (3.1.14),  where  Co  and  Cε  are  the  capacitances 
associated  with  the  air  and  dielectric  halves  of  the  actuator,  respectively.    Capacitance  C  was 
defined  in  (3.1.8),  and  equals  εA/s  where  A  is  the  plate  area  and  s  is  the  plate  separation.    It 
follows that: 

C = Cε + Co = εzW/s + εo(L - z)W/s = [z(ε - εo) + εoL]W/s 

 

(6.2.17) 

The  force  f  pulling  the  dielectric  slab  between  the  charged  plates  is  given  by  the  force-
energy relation (6.2.6) and can be combined with (6.2.16) and (6.2.17) to yield:

This  force  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  electric  field  strength  E  between  the  two  plates  by

f ≅ (E2sW/2)(ε - εo) = [(ε - εo)E2/2]Ws = ΔPeA [N] 

(6.2.19) 

where  A  =  Ws  is  the  area  of  the  endface  of  the  dielectric  slab,  and  the  differential  electric 
pressure pulling the slab between the charged plates is: 

ΔPe = (ε - εo)E2/2  [Nm-2] 

(6.2.20) 

The  differential  pressure  ΔPe  pushing  the  interface  into  the  capacitor  is  thus  the  difference 
between  the  electric  pressure  on  one  side  of  the  dielectric  interface  and  that  on  the  other, where 
the pressure Pe on each side is simply the electric energy density there: 

- 161 -


Pe = εE2/2 	[Nm -2], [Jm-3] 

(6.2.21) 

Because the electric field at the right-hand end of the slab approaches zero, it exerts no additional 
force.  Electric pressure is discussed further in Section 5.5.2. 

Applying  these  ideas  to  the  rotary motor of Figure 6.2.3 simply  involves  replacing  the  rotor 
by its dielectric equivalent and situating it between conducting stator plates that are excited by V 
volts  so  as  to  pull  each  dielectric  quadrant  into  the  space  between  them.   Then V  is  switched  to 
zero  as  the  dielectric  exits  that  space  so  the  rotor  can  coast  unpowered  until  the  dielectric 
quadrants  start  entering  the  next  pair  of  stator  plates.   Thus  the  drive  voltage V  is  non-zero  half 
the  time,  with  two  voltage  pulses  per  revolution  of  this  two-quadrant  rotor.    The  timing  of  the 
voltages  must  be  responsive  to  the  exact  position  of  the  rotor,  which  is  often  determined  by  a 
separate  rotor  angular  position  sensor.    Start-up  can  fail  if  the  rotor  is  in  exactly  the  wrong 
position where f = 0 regardless of V, and the rotor will spin backwards if it starts from the wrong 
position.    Figure  6.3.6  suggests  how  multiple  segments  and  excitation  phases  can  avoid  this 
problem in the context of magnetic motors. 

Example 6.2B 
Design  a  maximum-power-density  rotary  electrostatic  motor  that  delivers  10  W  power  at 
ω ≅ 106 r s-1 without make/break or sliding electrical contacts. 

Solution:  	 A  segmented  dielectric  rotor  sandwiched  between  charged  conducting  plates  avoids 
sliding electrical contacts.  Assume the rotor has radius R, thickness s, and is made of 
two  electrically  insulated  dielectrics  having  permittivities  ε  =  10εo  and  εo,  and  that 
they are radially segmented as is the rotor in Figure 6.2.3, but with M segments rather 
than  4.  The  maximum  pressure  on  the  edges  of  the  rotor  dielectric  boundaries 
between  ε  and  εo  is  ΔPe  =  (ε  - εo)E2/2  [N  m-2].  The  mechanical  power  delivered 
during  the half cycle  the voltages are applied  to  the plate  is Tω = 20 = ΔPe(R/2)sMω. 
Let’s  arbitrarily  set  s  =  10-6,  E  =  106  [V  m-1],  and  M  =  800.  Therefore  R  = 
2×20/(sMωΔPe)  =  40/[10-6×800×106×9×8.85×10-12×(106)2/2]  =  1.3×10-3  [m].    The 
operating voltage is Es ≅ 1 volt and the power density is ~105 W/cm3. 

6.2.5  Electrical breakdown 

In every case the torque or force produced by an electrostatic MEMS actuator or motor is limited 
by the breakdown field EB = VB/d, where VB is the breakdown voltage, and the dependence of EB 
on d is non-linear.  Electric breakdown of a gas occurs when stray free electrons accelerated by E 
acquire enough velocity and energy (a few electron volts24) to knock additional free electrons off 
gas  molecules  when  they  collide,  thus  triggering  a  chain  reaction  that  leads  to  arcing  and 
potentially  destructive  currents.   Water molecules  shed  electrons much more  easily  in  collisions 
than  do  nitrogen  or  oxygen  molecules,  and  so  EB  is  much  lower  in  moist  air.    This  is  why  it  is 
easier  to  draw  visible  sparks  in  cold  dry  winter  air  than  it  is  in  summer,  because  in  winter  the 

24 An electron volt  is  the energy acquired by an electron or other equally charged particle as  it accelerates  through a 
potential difference of one volt.  It is equivalent to e = 1.6021×10-19 Joules.

field strengths can be much greater before breakdown occurs, and such high-voltage breakdowns 
are more visible. 

If,  however,  the  gap  between  the  two  electrodes  is  sufficiently  small,  the  probability 
diminishes  that an  ionizing collision will occur between any  free electron and a gas atom before 
the  electron  hits  the  positively  charged  electrode.    This  mean-free-path,  or  average  distance 
before  a  “collision”,  for  free  electrons  is  on  the  order  of  one  micron  in  air,  so  breakdown  is 
inhibited  for  gaps  less  than  the mean  free  path.   However,  even when  the  gap  is  so  narrow  that 
gas breakdown  is unlikely,  if  the  field  strength E  is  increased  to ~3 × 108  [V m-1], or  two orders 
of magnitude beyond typical values for EB in dry gas, any free electrons can then acquire enough 
energy  to  knock  an  ion  loose  from  the  positively  charged  wall.    Such  a  positive  ion  can  then 
acquire enough energy to release multiple electrons when it impacts the negatively charged wall, 
producing another form of chain reaction, electrical arcing, and breakdown. 

The reasons electric actuators and motors are so attractive on the scale of MEMS, but almost 
never  used  at  larger  scales,  are  therefore  that:  1)  the  breakdown  field  strength  EB  increases 
approximately two orders of magnitude for micron-sized gaps, enabling force densities up to four 
orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  usual,  and  2)  enormous  values  for  E  and  pressure  can  be 
achieved with reasonable voltages across micron or sub-micron gaps (⇒ ~3×108 [V m-1] and ~10 
lb/cm2). 

The breakdown fields for materials are problematic because any local defect can concentrate 
field strengths locally, exceeding the threshold.  Fields of ~106 Vm-1 are a nominal upper bound, 
although somewhat higher values are obtained in integrated circuits.

Rotary magnetic motors 

6.3.1  Commutated rotary magnetic motors 

Most  electric motors  and generators  are  rotary because  their motion  can  then be  continuous  and 
high  velocity,  which  improves  power  density  and  efficiency  while  prolonging  equipment  life. 
Figure 6.3.1  illustrates an  idealized motor with a  rotor comprising a single  loop of wire carrying 
current  I  in  the  uniform  magnetic  field  H .  The  magnetic  field  can  originate  from  permanent 
magnets  in  the  stationary  stator,  which  is  the magnetic  structure  within  which  the  rotor  rotates, 
or from currents flowing  in wires wrapped around  the stator.   The rotor typically has many turns 
of  wire,  often  wrapped  around  a  steel  core  with  poles  that  nearly  contact  the  stator  along  a 
cylindrical surface. 

The  total  torque  (force  times  radius) on  the motor axle  is  found by adding  the contributions 
from  each  of  the  four  sides  of  the  current  loop;  only  the  longitudinal  elements  of  length  W  at 
radius  r  contribute,  however.    This  total  torque  vector T f = × r    is  the  integral  of  the  torque 
contributions  from  the  force density F acting on each  incremental  length ds of  the wire along  its 
entire contour C: 
T = (cid:118)∫C

Thus the torque for this motor at the pictured instant is clockwise and equals:

(6.3.3)
 

In the special case where  H  is uniform over the coil area Ao = 2rW, we can define the magnetic 
moment M   of  the  coil,  where  | M |= IAo    and  where  the  vector  M  is  defined  in  a  right  hand 
sense relative to the current loop  I .  Then: 

T = M × μo H 

(6.3.4)

Because  the current flows only  in  the given direction, H  and  the  torque reverse as  the wire 
loop  passes  through  vertical  (θ =  nπ)  and  have  zero  average  value  over  a  full  rotation.    To 
achieve  positive  average  torque,  a  commutator  can  be  added,  which  is  a  mechanical  switch  on 
the rotor that connects one or more rotor windings with one or more stationary current sources in 
the  desired  sequence  and  polarity.    The  commutator  reverses  the  direction  of  current  at  times 
chosen  so  as  to  maximize  the  average  positive  torque.    A  typical  configuration  is  suggested  in 
Figure  6.3.2(a)  where  two  spring-loaded  carbon  brushes  pass  the  current  I  to  the  commutator 
contacts,  which  are  rigidly  attached  to  the  rotor  so  as  to  reverse  the  current  polarity  twice  per 
revolution.  This  yields  the  more  nearly  constant  torque  history  T(θ)  illustrated  by  the  dashed 
line  in  Figure  6.3.2(b).    In  this  approximate  analysis  of  a  DC  motor  we  assume  that  the  time

Power  is  conserved,  so  if  the  windings  are  lossless  then  the  average  electrical  power

V Pe I = Pm  I = Tω

(6.3.6)

This  same  voltage V  across  the  rotor windings  can  also  be  deduced  from  the  Lorentz  force

) 
trons  within  the  wire  windings  as

they move through  H .  For example, if the motor is open circuit (I ≡ 0), these electrons spinning 
about the rotor axis at velocity  v  will move along the wire due to the “ q v × μo H ” force on them 
until  they  have  charged  parts  of  that  wire  relative  to  other  parts  so  as  to  produce  a  “ qE ”  force 
that  balances  the  local magnetic  force,  producing  equilibrium  and  zero  additional  current.    Free 
electrons  in  equilibrium  have  repositioned  themselves  so  they  experience  no  net  Lorentz  force. 
Therefore:

The  integral  of  E   from  one  end  of  the  conducting wire  to  the  other  yields  the  open-circuit

in (6.3.8).

the current I, as illustrated in Figure 6.3.3.

(6.3.9)
 

When  the  motor  is  first  starting,  ω =  Φ  =  0  and  the  current  and  the  torque  are  maximum, 
where  Imax = Vs/(Rs + Rw).  The maximum  torque, or  “starting  torque”  from  (6.3.3), where Ao =

(6.3.10)
 

Since  Φ  =  0  when  v = 0 ,  IΦ  =  0  and  no  power  is  converted  then.    As  the  motor  accelerates 
toward  its  maximum  ω,  the  back-voltage  Φ steadily  increases  until  it  equals  the  source  voltage 
Vs so  that  the net driving voltage, torque T, and current I → 0 at ω = ωmax.  Since (6.3.8) says Φ

as illustrated in Figure 6.3.4.

where (6.3.8) says Φ = ωNAoμ
oH, so Pm  ∝ (Vsω - NAoμoHω ). 

Equation (6.3.12) says that if Vs >> Φ, which occurs for modest values of ω, then the motor 
power increases linearly with Φ and ω.  Also, if Vs = 0, then Pm is negative and the device acts as 
a  generator  and  transfers  electrical  power  to  Rs  +  Rw  proportional  to  Φ2  and  therefore  ω2. 
Moreover,  if  we  differentiate  Pm  with  respect  to  Φ  and  set  the  result  to  zero,  we  find  that  the 
mechanical power  is greatest when Φ = Vs/2, which  implies ωp = ωmax/2.  In either  the motor or 
generator  case,  the  maximum  power  transfer  is  usually  limited  by  currents  overheating  the 
insulation or by high voltages causing breakdown.  Even when no power is transferred, the back-
voltage Φ could cause breakdown  if  the device spins too fast.   Semiconductor switches  that may 
fail before the motor insulation are increasingly replacing commutators so the risk of excessive ω 
is  often  a  design  issue.  In  an  optimum  motor  design,  all  failure  types  typically  occur  near  the 
same loading levels or levels of likelihood. 

Typical  parameters  for  a  commutated  2-inch  motor  of  this  type  might  be:  1)  B  =  μoH  = 
0.4  Tesla  (4000  gauss)  provided  by  permanent  magnets  in  the  stator,  2)  an  N  =  50-turn  coil  on 
the rotor with effective area A = 10-3N [m2], 3) Vs = 24 volts, and 4) Rs + Rw = 0.1 ohm.  Then it 
follows from (6.3.11), (6.3.12) for Φ = Vs/2, and (6.3.10), respectively, that:

In  practice,  most  motors  like  that  of  Figure  6.3.1  wrap  the  rotor  windings  around  a  high 
permeability  core with  a  thin  gap  between  rotor  and  stator;  this maximizes H  near  the  current  I. 
Also, if the unit is used as an AC generator, then there may be no need for the polarity-switching 
commutator if the desired output frequency is simply the frequency of rotor rotation. 

Example 6.3A 
Design a commutated DC magnetic motor  that delivers maximum mechanical power of 1 kW at 
600 rpm.  Assume B = 0.2 Tesla and that the source voltage Vs = 50 volts. 

Solution:  Maximum mechanical  power  is  delivered  at ωp  = ωmax/2  (see  Figure  6.3.4).  Solving 
(6.3.13)  yields  NAo  =  Vs/(ωmaxμoH)  =  50/(2×600×60×2π×0.2)  =  5.53×10-4,  where 
ωmax  corresponds  to  1200  rpm.    If  N  =  6,  then  the  winding  area  2rW  =  Ao  ≅ 
1  cm2.      To  find  Imax  we  use  (6.3.14)  to  find  the  maximum  allowed  value  of 
Rs  +  Rw  =  (VsΦ  - Φ2)/Pm.  But  when  the  delivered  mechanical  power  Pmech  is 
maximum, Φ = V /2, so R  + R  = (50×25 - 252
3
)/10  = 0.63Ω, which could  limit N  if 
s
s
w
the wire is too thin.  Imax = Vs/(Rs + Rw) = 50/0.63 = 80 [A].  The starting torque Tmax 
=  Imax(NAo)μoH  =  80(5.53×10-4)0.2  =  0.22  [N  m].    This  kilowatt  motor  occupies  a 
fraction of  a  cubic  inch  and may  therefore overheat because  the  rotor  is  small and  its 
thermal  connection  with  the  external  world  is  poor  except  through  the  axle.    It  is 
probably  best  used  in  short  bursts  between  cooling-off  periods.    The  I2Rw  thermal 
power dissipated in the rotor depends on the wire design. 

6.3.2  Reluctance motors 

Reluctance  motors  combine  the  advantages  of  rotary  motion  with  the  absence  of  rotor  currents 
and  the  associated  rotary  contacts.  Figure  6.3.5  suggests  a  simple  idealized  configuration  with 
only a single drive coil.

When  the  coil  is  energized  the  rotor  is  pulled  by  the  magnetic  fields  into  alignment  with  the 
magnetic  fields  linking  the  two  poles  of  the  stator,  where  μ >>  μo  in  both  the  rotor  and  stator. 
Reluctance motors must sense the angular position of the rotor, however, so the stator winding(s) 
can  be  excited  at  the  right  times  so  as  to  pull  the  passive  high-μ  rotor  toward  its  next  rotary 
position,  and  then  not  retard  it  as  it  moves  on  toward  the  following  attractive  position.    For 
example,  the  current  I  in  the  figure  will  pull  the  rotor  so  as  to  increase  θ,  which  is  the  overlap 
angle between the rotor and the stator poles.  Once the overlap is complete the current I would be 
set  to  zero  as  the  rotor  coasts  until  the  poles  again  have  θ ≅ 0  and  are  in  position  to  be  pulled 
forward  again  by  I.  Such  motors  are  efficient  if  hysteresis  losses  in  the  stator  and  rotor  are 
modest and the stator windings are nearly lossless. 

The torque on such a reluctance motor can be readily calculated using (6.2.12):

The  total magnetic energy wT  includes wμ within  the rotor and stator, wg  in  the air gaps between 
them,  and  any  energy  in  the  power  supply  driving  the  motor.    Fortunately  we  can  simplify  the 
problem  by  noting  that  wg  generally  dominates,  and  that  by  short-circuiting  the  stator  the  same 
torque exists without any power source if I remains unchanged. 

The circumstances  for which  the gap energy dominates  the  total energy wT are easily  found 
from the static integral form of Ampere’s law (1.4.1):

To derive an approximate result we may assume the coil has N  turns,  the width of each gap  is b, 
and  the contour C  threads  the coil and  the  rest of  the motor over a distance ~2D, and  through an 
approximately  constant  cross-section A; D  is  the  rotor  diameter.   Since  the  boundary  conditions 
in  each  gap  require  B⊥  be  continuous,  μHμ ≅ μoHg,  where  Hμ ≅ Hstator  ≅ Hrotor  and  Hg  ≡ Hgap. 
The relative energies stored in the two gaps and the rotor/stator are:

Thus wg >> wμ  if  b/D  >>  μo/μ.  Since  gaps  are  commonly  b ≅  100 microns,  and  iron  or  steel  is 
often  used  in  reluctance motors, μ ≅ 3000,  so  gap  energy wg  dominates  if  the motor  diameter D 
<<  0.3  meters.    If  this  approximation  doesn’t  apply  then  the  analysis  becomes  somewhat  more 

- 169 -


complex  because  both  energies  must  be  considered;  reluctance  motors  can  be  much  larger  than 
0.3 meters and still function. 

Under  the approximations wT  ≅ wg and A = gap area =  rθW, we may compute  the  torque T 
using (6.3.16) and (6.3.18):26

(6.3.25) 

The  resulting  torque  T  in  (6.3.25)  can  be  interpreted  as  being  the  product  of  radius  r  and 
twice  the  force  exerted  at  the  leading  edge  of  each  gap  (twice,  because  there  are  two  gaps), 
where this force is the magnetic pressure μoH 2
-2
g /2 [N m ] times the gap area Wb projected on the 
direction of motion.  Because the magnetic field  lines are perpendicular  to  the direction of force, 
the magnetic  pressure  pushes  rather  than  pulls,  as  it would  if  the magnetic  field were  parallel  to 
the direction of force.  Unfortunately, increasing the gap b does not increase the force, because it 
weakens  Hg  proportionately,  and  therefore  weakens  T  ∝  H2.  In  general,  b  is  designed  to  be 
minimum  and  is  typically  limited  to  roughly  25-100 microns  by  thermal  variations  and  bearing 
and manufacturing  tolerances.   The magnetic  field  in  the gap  is  limited by  the saturation  field of 
the magnetic material, as discussed in Section 2.5.4. 

The drive circuits  initiate  the current  I  in  the  reluctance motor of Figure 6.3.5 when  the gap 
area rθW is minimum, and terminate it when that area becomes maximum.  The rotor then coasts 
with  I  =  0  and  zero  torque  until  the  area  is  again  minimum,  when  the  cycle  repeats. 
Configurations  that  deliver  continuous  torque  are more  commonly  used  instead  because  of  their 
smoother performance. 

26 The  approximate dependence  (6.3.19) of wr/s upon A =  rθW breaks down when θ→0,  since wg doesn’t dominate 
then and (6.3.19) becomes approximate.

Figure 6.3.6  Reluctance motor with 3 stator and 4 rotor poles. 
 

Figure 6.3.6  illustrates a  reluctance motor  that provides continuous  torque using  three stator 
poles (A, B, C) and four rotor poles (1, 2, 3, 4).   When windings A and B are excited, rotor pole 
1  is  pulled  clockwise  into  stator  pole  B.    The  gap  area  for  stator  pole A  is  temporarily  constant 
and  contributes  no  additional  torque.    After  the  rotor  moves  π/9  radians,  the  currents  are 
switched  to  poles  B  and  C  so  as  to  pull  rotor  pole  2  into  stator  pole  C,  while  rotor  pole  1 
contributes  no  torque.  Next  C  and  A  are  excited,  and  this  excitation  cycle  (A/B,  B/C,  C/A)  is 
repeated  six  times  per  revolution.    Counter-clockwise  torque  is  obtained  by  reversing  the 
excitation  sequence.    Many  pole  combinations  are  possible,  and  those  with  more  poles  yield 
higher torques because torque is proportional to the number of active poles.  In this case only one 
2/2) [N m]. 
pole is providing torque at once, so the constant torque T = bW(μoHg

A  calculation  very  similar  to  that  above  also  applies  to  relays  such  as  that  illustrated  in 
Figure  6.3.7,  where  a  coil  magnetizes  a  flexible  or  hinged  bar,  drawing  it  downward  to  open 
and/or close one or more electrical contacts.

The magnetic pressure  is attractive parallel  to  the  field  lines,  tending  to close  the gap.   The units 
N/m2 are identical to J/m3.  Note that the minus sign is used in (6.3.29) because f is the magnetic 
force closing the gap, which equals the mechanical force required to hold it apart; motion in the x 
direction reduces wg. 

Magnetic  micro-rotary  motors  are  difficult  to  build  without  using  magnetic  materials  or 
induction27 because it is difficult to provide reliable sliding electrical contacts to convey currents 
to  the  rotor.    One  form  of  rotary  magnetic  motor  is  similar  to  that  of  Figures  6.2.3  and  6.2.4, 
except that the motor pulls into the segmented gaps a rotating high-permeability material instead 
of  a  dielectric,  where  the  gaps  would  have  high  magnetic  fields  induced  by  stator  currents  like 
those  in Figure 6.3.6.   As  in  the case of  the  rotary dielectric MEMS motors discussed  in Section 
6.2,  the  timing  of  the  currents must  be  synchronized with  the  angular  position  of  the  rotor.   The 
force  on  a  magnetic  slab  moving  into  a  region  of  strong  magnetic  field  can  be  shown  to 
approximate  AμH 2
μ  /2  [N],  where  A  is  the  area  of  the  moving  face  parallel  to  Hμ,  which  is  the 
field within the moving slab, and μ>>μo.  The rotor can also be made permanently magnetic so it 
is attracted or repelled by the synchronously switched stator fields; permanent magnet motors are 
discussed later in Section 6.5.2. 

Example 6.3B 
A  relay  like  that  of  Figure  6.3.7  is  driven  by  a  current  source  I  [A]  and  has  a  gap  of  width  g. 
What is the force f(g) acting to close the gap?  Assume  the cross-sectional area A of  the gap and 
metal  is constant around  the device, and note  the  force  is depends on whether  the gap  is open or 
closed. 

Solution:  This force is the pressure μoH 2
g /2 times the area A (6.3.29), assuming μ >> μo.  Since 
∇ × H = J ,  therefore  NI  = (cid:118)∫ H ( s )  ds  = H g  
g  + H Sμ ,  where  S  is  the  path  length  around 
the  loop  having  permeability  μ.  When  Hgg  >>  HμS,  then  Hg  ≅  NI/g  and  f  ≅ 

27 Induction motors, not discussed in this text, are driven by the magnetic forces produced by a combination of rotor 
and stator currents, where  the  rotor currents are  induced by  the  time-varying magnetic  fields  they experience, much 
like a transformer.  This avoids the need for direct electrical contact with the rotor.

Linear magnetic motors and actuators 

6.4.1 

Solenoid actuators 

Compact  actuators  that  flip  latches  or  switches,  increment  a  positioner,  or  impact  a  target  are 
often  implemented  using  solenoids.    Solenoid  actuators  are  usually  cylindrical  coils  with  a 
slideably  disposed  high-permeability  cylindrical  core  that  is  partially  inserted  at  rest,  and  is 
drawn  into  the  solenoid  when  current  flows,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6.4.1.    A  spring  (not 
illustrated) often holds the core near its partially inserted rest position.

If we  assume  the diameter of  the  solenoid  is  small  compared  to  its  length,  then  the  fringing 
fields  at  the  ends  of  the  coil  and  core  can  be  neglected  relative  to  the  field  energy  stored 
elsewhere  along  the  solenoid.  If  we  integrate  H  along  contour  C1  (see  figure)  we  obtain  zero 
from Ampere’s law because no net current flows through C1 and  D t

This implies  H ≅ 0  outside the solenoid unless Hz is approximately uniform outside, a possibility 
that  is  energetically  disfavored  relative  to H  being  purely  internal  to  the  coil.   Direct  evaluation 

- 173 -


of  H   using  the  Biot-Savart  law  (1.4.6)  also  yields  H 0≅   outside.  If  we  integrate  H  along
contour C2, which passes along the axis of the solenoid for unit distance, we obtain: 
(cid:118)∫ H d• s  = N  o I
C2

 = −H  z 

(6.4.2)
 

where No  is defined as  the number of  turns of wire per meter of  solenoid  length.   We obtain  the 
same  answer  (6.4.2)  regardless  of  the  permeability  along  the  contour  C2,  provided  we  are  not 
near  the  ends  of  the  solenoid  or  its moveable  core.   For  example,  (6.4.2)  also  applies  to  contour 
C3, while the integral of⎯H around C4 is zero because the encircled current there is zero. 

Since (6.4.2) requires that Hz along  the solenoid axis be approximately constant, Bz must be 
a  factor  of μ/μo  greater  in  the  permeable  core  than  it  is  in  the  air-filled  portions  of  the  solenoid. 
Because  boundary  conditions  require  B⊥    to  be  continuous  at  the  core-air  boundary,  H⊥   must 
be discontinuous there so that μHμ = μoHo, where Hμ and Ho are the axial values of H in the core 
and  air,  respectively.  This  appears  to  conflict  with  (6.4.2),  which  suggests  H  inside  the 
solenoid  is  independent of μ, but  this applies only  if we neglect fringing fields at  the ends of  the 
solenoid  or  near  boundaries  where  μ  changes.  Thus  the  axial  H  varies  approximately  as 
suggested in Figure 6.4.1(b): it has a discontinuity at the boundary that relaxes toward constant H 
=  NoI  away  from  the  boundary  over  a  distance  comparable  to  the  solenoid  diameter.    Two 
representative  field  lines  in  Figure  6.4.1(a)  suggest  how⎯B  diverges  strongly  at  the  end  of  the 
magnetic  core  within  the  solenoid  while  other  field  lines  remain  roughly  constant  until  they 
diverge at the right end of the solenoid.  The transition region between the two values of Bz at the 
end of the solenoid occurs over a distance roughly equal to the solenoid diameter, as suggested in 
Figure  6.4.1(b).  The magnetic  field  lines⎯B  and⎯H  "repel"  each  other  along  the  protruding  end 
of  the high permeability  core on  the  left  side of  the  figure,  resulting  in  a nearly  linear decline  in 
magnetic  field  within  the  core  there;  at  the  left  end  of  the  core  there  is  again  a  discontinuity  in 
|Hz| because⎯B⊥ must be continuous. 

Having  approximated  the  field  distribution we  can  now  calculate  energies  and  forces  using 
the  expression  for  magnetic  energy  density,  Wm  =  μH2/2  [J  m-3].    Except  in  the  negligible 
fringing field regions at the ends of  the solenoid and at  the ends of  its core,  |H| ≅ NoI (6.4.2) and 
μH2  >>  μoH2,  so  to  simplify  the  solution we  neglect  the  energy  stored  in  air  as we  compute  the 
magnetic force fz pulling on the core in the +z direction: 

f z  = −dw

T  dz

 

[N]

 
 

(6.4.3)
 

The energy  in  the core  is confined  largely  to  the  length z within  the solenoid, which has a cross-
sectional area A [m2].  The total magnetic energy wm thus approximates: 

w ≅ Az

(6.4.4)
 

If we assume wT = wm and differentiate  (6.4.4) assuming H  is  independent of z, we  find  the 
magnetic  force  expels  the  core  from  the  solenoid,  the  reverse of  the  truth.   To obtain  the  correct 
answer we must differentiate the total energy wT in the system, which includes any energy in the

power source supplying the current I.  To avoid considering a power supply we may alternatively 
assume  the  coil  is  short-circuited  and  carrying  the  same  I  as  before.    Since  the  instantaneous 
force  on  the  core  depends  on  the  instantaneous  I  and  is  the  same whether  it  is  short-circuited  or 
connected to a power source, we may set: 

v = 0 = dΛ/dt 

 

where:

Hμ  is  the value of H  inside  the core  (μ) and Noz  is  the number of  turns of wire circling  the core, 
where No is the number of turns per meter of coil length.  But Hμ = Js [A m-1] = NoI, so:

where Hμ  = H.  This  force  is  exactly  the  area A  of  the  end  of  the  core  times  the  same magnetic 
pressure μH2/2  [Nm-2] we  saw  in  (6.3.25), but  this  time  the magnetic  field  is pulling on  the core 
in  the  direction  of  the  magnetic  field  lines,  whereas  before  the  magnetic  field  was  pushing 
perpendicular to the field lines.  This pressure equals the magnetic energy density Wm, as before. 
A  slight  correction  for  the  non-zero  influence  of  μo  and  associated  small  pressure  from  the  air 
side  could  be  made  here,  but  more  exact  answers  to  this  problem  generally  also  require 
consideration of the fringing fields and use of computer tools. 

It  is  interesting  to note how  electric  and magnetic  pressure  [N/m2]  approximates  the  energy 
density  [J m-3] stored  in  the  fields, where we have neglected  the pressures applied  from  the  low-
field side of  the boundary when ε >> εo or μ >> μo.  We have now seen examples where  E  and 
H  both  push  or  pull  on  boundaries  from  the  high-field  (usually  air)  side  of  a  boundary,  where 
both  E  and  H  pull in the direction of their field lines, and push perpendicular to them.

6.4.2  MEMS magnetic actuators 

One form of magnetic MEMS switch is illustrated in Figure 6.4.2.  A control current I2 deflects a 
beam  carrying  current  I1.  When  the  beam  is  pulled  down  toward  the  substrate,  the  switch  (not 
shown)  will  close,  and  when  the  beam  is  repelled  upward  the  switch  will  open.  The  Lorentz 
force  law  (1.2.1)  states  that  the magnetic  force  f  on  a  charge  q  is  q v × μo H ,  and  therefore  the 
force  density  per  unit  length  F  [N  m-1]  on  a  current  I1 = Nq v  induced  by  the  magnetic  field 
H12  at position 1 produced by I2 is:

(6.4.11) 

N  is  the number of moving charges per meter of conductor length, and we assume that all forces 
on these charges are conveyed directly to the body of the conductor.

If  the  plate  separation  d  <<  W,  then  fringing  fields  can  be  neglected  and  the  I2-induced 
magnetic  field  affecting  current  I1  is  H12 ,  which  can  be  found  from  Ampere’s  law  (1.4.1) 
computed for a contour C circling I2 in a right-hand sense:

(6.4.12)

Thus  H12  ≅  zˆI2  2W .  The upward pressure on  the upper beam  found  from  (6.4.11) and  (6.4.12) 
is then: 

P F W ≅ xˆ μo 1I I 2

(6.4.13)

If  I1  =  -I2  then  the  magnetic  field  between  the  two  closely  spaced  currents  is  Ho ′  =  I1/W  and 
oH o  2  [N  m-2];  this  expression  for  magnetic  pressure  is  derived 
(6.4.13)  becomes  p = μxˆ
' 2
differently in (6.4.15). 

This pressure on  the  top  is downward  if both currents  flow  in  the  same direction, upward  if 
they are opposite, and zero  if either  is zero.  This device  therefore can perform a variety of  logic 
functions.  For  example,  if  a  switch  is  arranged  so  its  contacts  are  closed  in  state  “1”  when  the

beam  is forced upward by both I1 and I2 being positive (these currents were defined  in  the figure 
as flowing in opposite directions), and not otherwise, this is an “and” gate. 

An  alternate  way  to  derive  magnetic  pressure  (6.4.13)  is  to  note  that  if  the  two  currents  I1 
and  I2  are  anti-parallel,  equal,  and  close  together  (d  <<  W),  then  H 0 outside  the  two

conductors  and Ho'  is  doubled  in  the  gap  between  them  so WHo' =  I1.  That  is,  if  the  integration 
contour C circles either current alone then (6.4.12) becomes:

But  not  all  electrons  comprising  these  currents  see  the  same magnetic  field  because  the  currents 
closer  to  the  two  innermost  conductor  surfaces  screen  the  outer  currents,  causing  the  magnetic 
field to approach zero inside the conductors, as suggested in Figure 6.4.3.

Therefore  the  average  moving  electron  sees  a  magnetic  field  Ho'/2,  half  that  at  the  surface28. 
Thus the total magnetic pressure upward on the upper beam given by (6.4.13) and (6.4.14) is:

where  Ho'  is  the  total  magnetic  field  magnitude  between  the  two  conductors,  and  there  is  no

pressure [N m-2] equals  the magnetic energy density [J m-3] stored  in  the magnetic field adjacent 
to the conductor (2.7.8). 

28 A simple integral of the form used in (5.2.4) yields this same result for pressure.

Permanent magnet devices 

6.5.1 

Introduction 

A  permanent  magnet  (Section  2.5.4)  has  a  residual  flux  density Br   when  H = 0   inside  it,  and 
this  is  the  rest  state  of  an  isolated  permanent magnet.    In  this  case  the magnetic  energy  density 
2
inside  is  Wm = • H 2 
B 
= 0 , and  that outside,  Wm  = μo H  ≠ 0 .  Boundary conditions  (2.6.5)  say
Br ⊥  = μo H o ⊥ ,  where  Ho⊥  is  the  boundary  value  in  air.   Since  H //  is  continuous  across  an 
insulating boundary and  H r  = 0  inside a resting permanent magnet,  Ho //  = 0  too.  If an external 
H   is  applied  to  a  permanent magnet,  then  B  within  that magnet  is  altered  as  suggested  by  the 
hysteresis diagram in Figure 2.5.3(b). 

The  force  f  [N] attracting a permanent magnet  to a high-permeability material can be  found 
using: 

f

(6.5.1)

where  x  is  the  separation  between  the  two,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6.5.1,  and  wm  is  the  total 
energy  in  the  magnetic  fields  [J].    The  changing  magnetic  energy  in  the  high-permeability 
material  is negligible  compared  to  that  in  air because: 1) boundary  conditions  require  continuity 
in  B⊥   across the boundary so that  B⊥  = μH⊥  = μo H o ⊥ , and therefore H⊥/Ho⊥ = μo/μ << 1, and 
m [Jm-3] =

2) W

The variable magnetic energy is dominated by the energy wm in the gap, which is the energy 
density, Wm = μoH 2
gap /2, times the volume of the gap Ax, where A is the area of the magnet face 
and x is the gap width.  Thus:

(6.5.2)
 

Differentiating wm with  respect  to x yields  the attractive  force  f ≅ μoH 2
gap A/2  [N], and  the  force 
density:

gap  2 = Wgap  = B 2

(6.5.3)

gap  2μo  [Nm-2].  Note that the rest energy density 
This can be expressed in terms of B:  F B=  2
inside  the  permanent  magnet  is  zero,  so  it  exerts  no  pressure.  Most  permanent  magnets  have 
magnetic flux densities B less than one Tesla (104 gauss), so a magnet this powerful with an area 
A  =  10  cm2  (~the  size  of  a  silver  dollar)  would  therefore  apply  an  attractive  force  AF  = 
0.001×12/2×4π10-7  ≅ 400N (~100 pound force).  A more typical permanent magnet the same size 
might attract a steel surface with only a 10–20 pound force. 

If  two  equal  coin-shaped  permanent  magnets  are  stacked  so  they  stick  together,  then  they 
-2
experience  primarily  the  attractive  magnetic  pressure  B 2
gap /2μ
o  [Nm ]  associated  with  the  gap 
between them, and are bonded with approximately the same force density as if one of them were 
merely a high-permeability sheet.  In this case  Bgap  ≅ B r  , as shown in Figure 2.5.3(b). 

This  simple  gap-based  magnetic  pressure  model  does  not  explain  the  repulsive  force 
between  two such coin magnets when one  is flipped, however, for  then Hg  ≅ 0  and wgap  ≅ 0 for 
all  small  values  of  x,  and  dwg/dx  is  also  ~0.  In  this  case  the  energy  of  interest  wT  lies  largely 
inside  the magnets.   This  special  case  illustrates  the  risks of  casually  substituting  simple models 
for  the  underlying  physical  reality  captured  in Maxwell’s  equations,  the  Lorentz  force  law,  and 
material characteristics. 

Permanent magnets  fail  above  their Curie  temperature when  the magnetic domains become 
scrambled.    Cooling  overheated  permanent  magnets  in  a  strong  external  magnetic  field  usually 
restores  them.    Some  types  of  permanent  magnets  can  also  fail  at  very  low  temperatures,  and 
should not be used where that is a risk. 

6.5.2 

Permanent magnet motors 

Compact  high-power-density  motors  often  incorporate  permanent  magnets  so  current  is  not 
wasted  on  maintenance  of  H .  For  example,  the  stator  for  the  rotary  single-turn  coil  motor  of 
Figure  6.3.1  could  easily  contain  permanent  magnets,  avoiding  the  need  for  current  excitation. 
Moreover, modern permanent magnets can provide quite  intense  fields, above 0.5 Tesla.    In  this 
case  we  should  also  consider  the  effect  of  the  rotor  currents  on  the  stator  permanent  magnets, 
whereas  in  the  earlier  example we  considered  the  stator  fields  and  rotor  currents  as  given.    The 

- 179 -


incremental  permeability  of  a  permanent  magnet  varies  with  the  applied  H.    If  H  is  oriented  to 
attract  the  stator pole and μoH > Br,  then B  in  the permanent magnet will  increase above Br  (see 
Figure  2.5.3), where  the  incremental  permeability  approaches μo.  To  the  extent  the  incremental 
μ > μo, some reluctance-motor torque will supplement the dominant torque studied earlier. 

The permanent magnets can alternatively be placed on  the rotor, avoiding  the need for rotor 
currents  or  a  commutator,  provided  the  stator  currents  are  synchronously  switched  instead. 
Clever  electronics  can  detect  the  voltage  fluctuations  in  the  stator  induced  by  the  rotor  and  thus 
deduce  its  position,  potentially  avoiding  the  need  for  a  separate  expensive  angle  encoder  for 
stator current synchronization. 

Because different parts of permanent magnets  see different B/H histories,  and  these depend 
in  part  on  B/H  histories  elsewhere  in  the  device,  modern  design  of  such  motors  or  generators 
relies extensively on complex software tools for modeling support. 

Example 6.5A 
Two  identical  coin-shaped  permanent  magnets  of  12-cm  diameter  produce  0.05  Tesla  field 
perpendicular  to  their  flat  faces;  one  side  is  the  north  pole  of  the magnet  and  the  other  is  south. 
What is the maximum force f attracting the magnets when placed face to face? 

Solution:  Using (6.5.3) yields f = ABgap

2/2μo = π(0.06)2(0.05)2/(2×1.26×10-6) = 11.2 [N].

Electric and magnetic sensors 

6.6.1  Electrostatic MEMS sensors 

Sensors  are  devices  that  respond  to  their  environment.    Some  sensors  alter  their  properties  as  a 
function  of  the  chemical,  thermal,  radiation,  or  other  properties  of  the  environment,  where  a 
separate  active  circuit  probes  these  properties.    The  conductivity,  permeability,  and  permittivity 
of materials are  typically sensitive  to multiple environmental parameters.   Other sensors directly 
generate  voltages  in  response  to  the  environment  that  can  be  amplified  and  measured.    One 
common MEMS  sensor  measures  small  displacements  of  cantilevered  arms  due  to  temperature, 
pressure, acceleration, chemistry, or other changes.  For example, temperature changes can curl a 
thin  cantilever  due  to  differences  in  thermal  expansion  coefficient  across  its  thickness,  and 
chemical  reactions  on  the  surface  of  a  cantilever  can  change  its mass  and mechanical  resonance 
frequency.  Microphones can detect vibrations in such cantilevers, or accelerations along specific 
axes. 

Figure 6.6.1 portrays a standard capacitive MEMS sensor that illustrates the basic principles, 
where  the  capacitor  plates  of  area  A  are  separated  by  the  distance  d,  and  the  voltage  V  is 
determined  in  part  by  the  voltage  divider  formed  by  the  source  resistance  Rs  and  the  amplifier 
input resistance R.  Vs is the source voltage.

The instantaneous circuit response to an increase δ in the plate separation d is an increase in 
capacitor  voltage  V  above  its  normal  equilibrium  value  Ve  determined  by  the  voltage  divider, 
where  Ve  =  VsR/(R+Rs).  The  capacitor  then  discharges  exponentially  toward  Ve  with  a  time 
constant  τ  =  (R//R )C.29
    See  Section  3.5.1  for  further  discussions  of RC  circuit  behavior.    If Rs 
s
>> R then τ ≅ RC.  If Rs >> R and R represents the input resistance of a high-performance sensor 
amplifier,  then  that  sensor  can  detect  as  little  as  ΔwΒ ≅ 10-20  joules  per  “bit  of  information”30. 
This  can  be  compared  to  the  incremental  increase  Δwc  in  capacitor  energy  due  to  the 
displacement δ << d as C decreases to C':

A simple example illustrates the extreme potential sensitivity of such a sensor.  Assume the plate 
separation  d  is  one  micron,  the  plates  are  1-mm  square  (A  =  10-6),  and  V  =  300.  Then  the 
minimum detectable δ given by (6.6.1) for Δwc = ΔwΒ = 10-20 Joules is:

(6.6.2) 

At  this potential  level of  sensitivity we  are  limited  instead by  thermal  and mechanical noise due 
to  the  Brownian  motion  of  air  molecules  and  conduction  electrons.    A  more  practical  set  of 
parameters might  involve  a  less  sensitive  detector  (ΔB  ≅ 10-14)  and  lower  voltages  (V ≅ 5);  then 
δmin  ≅ 10-10 meters ≅ 1 angstrom (very roughly an atomic diameter).   The dynamic range of such 
a sensor would be enormously greater, of course.  This one-angstrom sensitivity is comparable to 
that of the human eardrum at ~1kHz. 

29 The resistance R of two resistors in parallel is R = (Ra  (cid:38) Rb) = RaRb/(Ra + Rb). 
30 Most good communications systems can operate with acceptable probabilities of error  if Eb/No >~10, where Eb  is 
the  energy  per  bit  and  No  =  kT  is  the  noise  power  density  [W  Hz-1]  =  [J].  A  bit  is  a  single  yes-no  piece  of 
information.    Boltzmann's  constant  k  ≅  1.38×10-23  [J  oK-1],  and  T  is  the  system  noise  temperature,  which  might 
approximate  100K  in  a  good  system  at  RF  frequencies.    Thus  the  minimum  energy  required  to  detect  each  bit  of 
information is ~10No  = 10 kT ≅ 10-20 [J].

An  alternative  to  such  observations  of  MEMS  sensor  voltage  transients  is  to  observe 
changes  in  resonant  frequency  of  an  LC  resonator  that  includes  the  sensor  capacitance;  this 
approach can reduce the effects of low-frequency interference. 

6.6.2  Magnetic MEMS sensors 

Microscopic magnetic  sensors  are  less  common  than  electrostatic  ones  because  of  the  difficulty 
of  providing  strong  inexpensive  reliable  magnetic  fields  at  microscopic  scales.    High  magnetic 
fields  require  high  currents  or  strong  permanent  magnets.    If  such  fields  are  present,  however, 
mechanical  motion  of  a  probe  wire  or  cantilever  across  the  magnetic  field  lines  could  produce 
fluctuating voltages, as given by (6.1.4). 

6.6.3  Hall effect sensors 

Hall  effect  sensors  are  semiconductor  devices  that  produce  an  output  voltage  VHall  proportional 
to  magnetic  field  H ,  where  the  voltage  is  produced  as  a  result  of  magnetic  forces  on  charge 
carriers moving at velocity  v  within the semiconductor.  They can measure magnetic fields or, if 
the magnetic field is known, can determine the average velocity and type (hole or electron) of the 
charge carriers conveying current.  A typical configuration appears in Figure 6.6.2, for which the 
Hall-effect  voltage  VHall  is  proportional  to  the  current  I  and  to  the  perpendicular magnetic  field 
H .

Positively charged carriers moving at velocity  v  would be  forced downward by  f , as shown  in 
the  figure,  where  they  would  accumulate  until  the  resulting  electric  field  E  provided  a 
sufficiently  strong  balancing  force  qE  in  the  opposite  direction  to  produce  equilibrium.   In 
equilibrium  the  net  force  and  the  right-hand  side  of  (6.6.3) must  be  zero,  so  E

For  charge  carrier  velocities  of  30 m  s-1  and  fields μoH  of  0.1 Tesla, VHall would  be  3 millivolts 
across a width W of one millimeter, which is easily detected. 

If  the  charge  carriers  are  electrons  so  q  <  0,  then  the  sign  of  the  Hall  voltage  is  reversed. 
Since  the  voltage  depends  on  the  velocity  v  of  the  carriers  rather  than  on  their  number,  their 
average number density N [m-1] can be determined using I = Nqv.  That is, for positive carriers: 

v V=  H WμoH  ⎡⎣ms−1 ⎤⎦

(6.6.5)
 

(6.6.6)
 

Thus  the  Hall  effect  is  useful  for  understanding  carrier  behavior  (N,v)  as  a  function  of 
semiconductor composition.
