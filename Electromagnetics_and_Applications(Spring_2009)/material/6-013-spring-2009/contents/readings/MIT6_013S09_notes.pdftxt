Preface 

The  initial development of electrical science and engineering a century ago occurred almost 
entirely  within  the  domain  of  electromagnetics.  Most  electrical  curricula  remained  polarized 
around  that  theme  until  the  mid-twentieth  century  when  signal,  device,  and  computational 
subjects  became  dominant.    Continued  expansion  of  the  field  has  currently  relegated 
undergraduate  electromagnetics  to  perhaps  a  one-semester  subject  even  though  electromagnetic 
technology has expanded substantially and  is basic  to most applications.   To meet  the  increasing 
educational  challenge  of  providing  both  breadth  and  depth  in  electromagnetics  within  a  brief 
presentation,  this  text  uses  a  more  physics-based  approach  and  novel  methods  of  explaining 
certain phenomena.  It introduces students to electrodynamics across the entire range from statics 
to  dynamics,  and  from  motors  to  circuits,  communications,  optical  fibers,  and  lasers.    For 
example,  we  currently  cover  approximately  ninety  percent  of  the  text  in  a  one-semester  subject 
meeting with  faculty  four  hours  per week.    The  text  could  also  support  undergraduate  offerings 
over  two  quarters  or  even  two  semesters,  and  could  perhaps  also  be  used  at  the  entry  graduate 
level. 

The main  objectives  of  the  text  are  to:  1)  convey  those  big  ideas  essential  to  understanding 
the  electromagnetic  aspects  of  modern  electrical  and  computer  systems,  2)  expose  students  to 
enough  examples  to  make  the  big  ideas  tangible  and  erase  most  naiveté  about  dominant 
applications,  3)  provide  computational  experience  with  Maxwell’s  equations  sufficient  to  treat 
the  basic  examples,  4)  provide  the  understanding  and  skills  prerequisite  to  follow-on  subjects, 
and  5)  reinforce  prior  exposure  to  physics,  mathematics,  and  electrical  systems  so  as  to  help 
integrate student learning, including problem solving and design methods. 

The  first  two  chapters  are  the  core  of  the  text.    They  review  the  basic  physics  of 
electromagnetics  and  electromechanics  and  introduce  the  Lorentz  force  law,  Maxwell’s 
equations,  media,  boundary  conditions,  static  field  solutions,  uniform  plane  waves,  and  power 
and  energy.  Although  the  chapters  are  best  read  sequentially,  the  four  topical  areas  that  follow 
the  core  can  be  read  in  any  sequence  and  include:  1)  Chapters  3,  5,  and  6,  which  treat  RLC 
devices  and  circuits;  electromagnetic  forces  on  charges,  conductors,  and  media;  and  motors,  2) 
Chapters  4,  7,  and  8,  which  treat  quasistatics,  solutions  to  Laplace’s  equation,  and  TEM  lines, 
including  matching,  resonators,  and  transients,  3)  Sections  4.1–4.3  plus  Chapter  9,  which  treat 
field  relaxation,  non-uniform  plane waves,  reflection, waveguides,  and  cavity  resonators,  and  4) 
Chapters  10  and  11,  which  treat  radiation,  wire  and  aperture  antennas,  and  applications  such  as 
communications  systems  and  radar.  Two  “capstone”  chapters  then  follow:  Chapter  12 
introduces  optical  waveguides,  laser  amplifiers,  laser  oscillators,  and  other  optical  devices 
(Chapters  9  and  11  are  prerequisites),  and  Chapter  13  reviews  most  wave  phenomena  in  an 
acoustic context after Chapters 7, 9, and 10 have been covered.  This organization permits use of 
the  text  in  a  wide  variety  of  formats,  including  one-  and  two-semester  options.    Most 
prerequisites  are  reviewed  briefly  in  the Appendix  or within  the  text.    Future  versions will  have 
home problems and more examples. 

Special  thanks are owed  to  the many MIT  faculty who have  taught  this subject and  its  three 
merged  predecessors  while  sharing  their  insights  with  the  author  over  the  past  forty  years. 
Without  such  collegial  participation  the  scope  and  brevity  of  this  text  would  not  have  been

possible.  The  sections  on waves,  optics,  acoustics,  resonators,  and  statics  benefited  particularly 
from  interactions with  Professors Kong  and Haus,  Ippen  and Bers,  Stevens  and  Peake,  Smullin,

Chapter  1:    Introduction  to  Electromagnetics  and  Electromagnetic 
Fields 

1.1 

Review of foundations 

1.1.1 

Introduction 

Electromagnetics  involves  the  macroscopic  behavior  of  electric  charges  in  vacuum  and  matter. 
This behavior can be accurately characterized by the Lorentz force law and Maxwell’s equations, 
which  were  derived  from  experiments  showing  how  forces  on  charges  depend  on  the  relative 
locations  and  motions  of  other  charges  nearby.   Additional  relevant  laws  of  physics  include 
Newton’s  law,  photon  quantization,  and  the  conservation  relations  for  charge,  energy,  power, 
and  momentum.    Electromagnetic  phenomena  underlie  most  of  the  “electrical”  in  “electrical 
engineering” and are basic to a sound understanding of that discipline. 

Electrical  engineering  has  delivered  four  “miracles” —  sets  of  phenomena  that  could  each 
be considered  true magic prior  to  their development.   The first of  these  to  impress humanity was 
the  electrical  phenomenon  of  lightning,  often  believed  to  be  a  tool  of  heaven,  and  the  less 
powerful magnetic  force  that  caused  lodestones  to point north.   The  explanation  and  application 
of  these  invisible  forces  during  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries  vaulted  electrical 
engineering  to  the  forefront  of  commercial  interest  as  motors,  generators,  electric  lights, 
batteries, heaters, telephones, record players, and many other devices emerged. 

The  second  set  of  miracles  delivered  the  ability  to  communicate  instantly  without  wires 
around  the world,  not  only  dots  and  dashes,  but  also  voice,  images,  and  data.    Such  capabilities 
had  been  commonplace  in  fairy  tales,  but  were  beyond  human  reach  until  Hertz  demonstrated 
radiowave  transmission  in  1888,  15  years  after  Maxwell’s  predictions.    Marconi  extended  the 
technique to intercontinental distances. 

Third  came  electronics  and  photonics  —  the  ability  to  electrically  manipulate  individual 
electrons  and  atoms  in  vacuum  and  in matter  so  as  to  generate,  amplify, manipulate,  and  detect 
electromagnetic  signals.    During  the  twentieth  century  vacuum  tubes,  diodes,  transistors, 
integrated  circuits,  lasers,  and  superconductors  all  vastly  extended  the  capabilities  and 
applications of electromagnetics. 

The  fourth  set  of  electrical  phenomena  involves  cybernetics  and  informatics  —  the 
manipulation  of  electrical  signals  so  complex  that  entirely  new  classes  of  functionality  are 
obtained,  such  as  optimum  signal  processing,  computers,  robotics,  and  artificial  intelligence. 
This  text focuses on  the electromagnetic nature of  the first  three sets of phenomena and explores 
many of their most important applications. 

Chapter 1 of this text begins with a brief review of the underlying laws of physics, followed 
by  the  Lorentz  force  law  and  the  nature  of  electric  and  magnetic  fields.    Chapter  2  introduces 
electrodynamics  and Maxwell’s  equations,  leading  to  uniform  plane  waves  in  space  and media, 
and  definitions  of  power,  energy,  boundary  conditions,  and  uniqueness.    The  next  four  chapters 

- 11 -


address static and quasistatic systems beginning with Chapter 3, which explores electromagnetics 
in  the  context  of  RLC  circuits  and  devices.    Chapter  4  addresses  the  more  general  behavior  of 
quasistatic  electric  and  magnetic  fields  in  homogeneous  and  inhomogeneous  media.    Chapter  5 
introduces  electromagnetic  forces  while  Chapter  6  addresses  their  application  to  motors, 
generators, actuators, and sensors. 

The  second  half  of  the  text  focuses  on  electrodynamics  and  waves,  beginning  with  TEM 
transmission  lines  in  Chapters  7  and  8,  and  waves  in  media  and  at  boundaries  in  Chapter  9. 
Antennas and radiation are  treated  in Chapters 10 and 11, while optical and acoustic systems are 
addressed  in Chapters 12 and 13,  respectively.  Acoustics  is  introduced on  its own merits and as 
a  useful  way  to  review  electromagnetic  wave  phenomena  such  as  radiation  and  resonance  in  a 
more physical and familiar context.  The appendices list natural constants and review some of the 
prerequisite mathematics. 

The  rationalized  international  system  of  units  (rationalized  SI  units)  is  used,  which  largely 
avoids  factors of 4π.  SI units  emphasize meters  (m), kilograms  (kg),  seconds  (s), Amperes  (A), 
and Kelvins  (K); most other units can be expressed  in  terms of  these.   The SI system also  favors 
units  in  multiples  of  103;  for  example,  it  favors  meters  and  millimeters  over  centimeters.    The 
algebraic convention used here is that operations within parentheses are performed before others. 
Within  parentheses  and  exponents  and  elsewhere,  exponentiation  is  performed  first,  and 
multiplication before division; all these operations are performed before addition and subtraction. 

1.1.2  Review of basic physical concepts and definitions 

The  few  basic  concepts  summarized  below  are  central  to  electromagnetics.    These  concepts 
include  conservation  of  energy,  power,  and  charge,  and  the  notion  of  a  photon,  which  conveys 
one quantum of electromagnetic energy.    In addition, Newton’s  laws characterize  the kinematics 
of  charged  particles  and  objects  influenced  by  electromagnetic  fields.   The  conservation  laws 
also  follow  from Maxwell’s equations, which are presented  in Section 2.1 and,  together with  the 
Lorentz  force  law,  compress  all  macroscopic  electromagnetic  behavior  into  a  few  concise 
statements. 

This  text  neglects  relativistic  issues  introduced when  mass  approaches  the  velocity  of  light 
or  is converted  to or  from energy, and  therefore we have conservation of mass:  the  total mass m 
within a closed envelope remains constant. 

Conservation  of  energy  requires  that  the  total  energy  wT  [Joules]  remains  constant  within 
any  system  closed  so  that  no  power  enters  or  leaves,  even  though  the  form  of  the  internally 
stored  energy may  be  changing.   This  total  energy wT may  include  electric  energy we, magnetic 
energy  wm,  thermal  energy  wTh, mechanical  kinetic  energy  wk, mechanical  potential  energy  wp, 
and  energy  in  chemical,  atomic,  or  other  forms  wother;  wother  is  neglected  here.  Conservation  of 
energy means: 

wT = we + wm + wk + wp + wTh + wother [Joules] = constant 

(1.1.1) 

- 12 -


In  this  text  we  generally  use  lower  case  letters  to  indicate  totals,  and  upper  case  letters  to 
indicate  densities.  Thus  we  represent  total  energy  by  wT  [J]  and  total  energy  density  by 
WT  [J m-3].  Similarly,  f  [N] denotes  the  total  force on an object and F  [N m-3] denotes  the  force 
density. 

Unfortunately  the number of electromagnetic variables  is so  large  that many  letters are used 
in multiple ways, and sometimes  the meaning must be extracted  from  the context.   For example, 
the symbol f is used to signify both force and frequency. 

Newton’s  law  says  that a one-Newton  force  f would  cause an otherwise  force-free kilogram 
mass  to  accelerate  at one meter per  second per  second;  this defines  the Newton.  One Newton  is 
roughly  the  terrestrial gravitational  force on a quarter-pound weight (e.g.  the weight of  the apple 
that  allegedly  fell  on Newton’s  head,  prompting  him  to  conceive  the  law  of  gravity).   Newton’s 
law may be expressed as: 

f  = ma  [Newtons] 

(1.1.2) 

where m is the mass of the object [kg] and a is the induced acceleration [ms-2]. 

The unit of energy,  the Joule,  is  the  total energy wT delivered  to an object when a force f of 
one Newton is applied to it as it moves one meter in the direction z of the force.  Therefore: 

f = dw T 
dz 

(1.1.3)

The kinetic energy wk of a mass m moving at velocity v is: 

wk =  1
2 mv2  [J] 
which, when  added  to  its potential  energy  wp,  equals  its  total  energy wT  relative  to  a motionless 
reference position; i.e.: 

(1.1.4) 

wT = wk + wp 

(1.1.5) 

It  is  easy  to  see  that  if wp  remains  constant,  then  (1.1.3)  and  (1.1.4)  are  consistent with  f  = ma; 
that is, f = dwT/dz = dwk/dz = mv dv/dz = m(dz/dt)(dv/dz) = m dv/dt = ma. 

Conservation  of  power means,  for  example,  that  the  total  power  Pin  [Js-1]  entering  a  closed 
volume must equal the rate of increase [Js-1] of the total energy stored there; that is: 
Pin [W] =  dw T  [Js-1] 
dt

(1.1.6)

where dwT/dt is the time derivative of wT, and the units [Joules per second] are often replaced by 
their  equivalent,  Watts  [W].    If  dwT/dt  =  0,  then  the  power  flowing  into  a  closed  volume  must 
equal  the  power  flowing  out  so  that  power  is  conserved.    These  laws  also  apply  to 

- 13 -


electromagnetic power and energy, and their definition in terms of electromagnetic fields appears 
in Section 2.7. 

In  mechanical  systems  one  watt  is  delivered  to  an  object  if  it  received  one  joule  in  one 
second.  More generally the mechanical power P delivered to an object is P = fv  [W], where f is 
the only force [N] acting on the object, and v [ms-1] is the object’s velocity in the same direction 
as the force vector⎯f.  More generally, 

P f v 
= • ≡ fv cos

θ [W ] 

(1.1.7)

where⎯v is the velocity vector and θ is the angle between  f  and  v . 

Conservation  of momentum  requires  that  the  total momentum  of  a  set  of  interacting masses 
mi  remains  constant  if  the  set  is  free  from  external  forces.   The  momentum  of  any  object  is  mv 
[kg ms-1], so in a force-free environment: 
) dt
d (  m v
∑ i 
 
i
i

(1.1.8)

 
= 0 

 

Conservation  of  charge  requires  that  the  total  electric  charge  Q  inside  any  volume  must 
remain  constant  if  no  net  charge  crosses  the  boundaries  of  that  volume.    This  is  analogous  to 
conservation of mass, although nuclear and other processes can convert mass m  to energy E and 
vice-versa  (E  =  mc2).  Charge  conservation,  however,  has  no  significant  exceptions.    Electric 
charge  is  generally  quantized  in  positive  or  negative  multiples  of  the  charge  e  on  an  electron, 
where: 

e = - 1.6021 × 10-19 Coulombs 

(1.1.9) 

The  unit  of  charge,  one  Coulomb,  is  the  charge  conveyed  by  one  Ampere  flowing  for  one 
second, where the Ampere is the unit of electric current. 

Photons  carry  the  smallest  unit  of  energy  that  can  be  conveyed  by  electromagnetic  waves. 
The energy E of a single photon is: 

E = hf  [J] 

(1.1.10) 

where h  is Planck’s  constant  (6.624×10-34  [J  s])  and  f  is  the photon  frequency  [Hz].   Sometimes 
it is more convenient to think of electromagnetic waves as continuous waves, and sometimes it is 
more  convenient  to  think  of  them  as  consisting  of  particles  (photons),  each  of  energy  E.    The 
total power P conveyed by an electromagnetic wave at  frequency  f  is  therefore  the number N of 
photons passing per second times the photon energy E: 

P = N hf  [W] 

(1.1.11) 

The frequency of a wave is simply related to its wavelength λ and the velocity of light c: 

- 14 -


f = c/λ	

(1.1.12) 

Example 1.1A 
A  typical  fully  charged  1-kilowatt-hour  car  battery  can  accelerate  a  perfectly  efficient  1000-kg 
electric automobile to what maximum speed? 

Solution:	 The  battery  energy  we[J]  equals  1000  watts  times  3600  seconds  (one  kilowatt-hour). 
It  also  equals  the  maximum  kinetic  energy,  wk  =  mv2/2,  of  the  speeding  automobile 
(mass = m = 1000, velocity = v) after the battery is totally drained.  Therefore 
wk = 3.6×106 ⇒ v = (2wk/m)0.5 = (7.2×106/1000)0.5  ≅ 85 m s-1  ≅  190 mph. 

Example 1.1B 
A  sunny  day  delivers  ~1kw m-2;  to  how many  photons N  per  second  per  square meter  does  this 
correspond  if  we  (incorrectly)  assume  they  all  have  the  same  wavelength  λ  =  5×10-7  meters? 
(0.5 microns is in the visible band.)? 

Solution:  	 Power  =  Nhf  =  Nhc/λ  =  1  kw,  so  N  =  103λ/hc  ≅  103×5×10-7/(6.6×10-34×3×108)  ≅ 
2.5×1020 photons m-2s-1. 

1.2 

Forces and the measurement and nature of electromagnetic fields 

Electric  fields  E   and  magnetic  fields  H   are  manifest  only  by  the  forces  they  exert  on  free  or 
bound  electric  charges q  [Coulombs].   These  forces  are  completely  characterized by  the Lorentz 
force law: 

( + 
[  ] = q E  v × μ 
f N 
o H

)	

(Lorentz force law) 

(1.2.1) 

Thus we can define electric field⎯E (volts/meter) in terms of the observable force vector⎯f: 

E v/m ] 
[
= f  q	  

(electric field) 

(1.2.2)

for the special case of a charge q with velocity  v

0 .= 

Similarly  we  can  define  magnetic  field  H   [A  m-1]  in  terms  of  the  observed  force  vector⎯f 
given  by  the  Lorentz  force  equation  when  E 0 ;⎯H  can  be  sensed  only  by  charges  in  motion
= 
relative to the observer.  Although a single measurement of force on a motionless charge suffices 
to  determine⎯E,  measurements  of  two  charge  velocity  vectors  v   or  current  directions⎯I  are 
required  to  determine⎯H.  For  example,  the  arbitrary  test  charge  velocity  vector  xˆ v1  yields  f1  = 
qμov1H  sinθ, where  θ  is  the  angle  between⎯v  and⎯H  in  the  xˆ - yˆ   plane  (see  Figure  1.2.1).  The 
unit vector  yˆ   is defined as being  in  the observed direction⎯f1  ×⎯v1 where⎯f1 defines  the  zˆ   axis. 
A second measurement with the test charge velocity vector  yˆ v2 yields f2 = qμov2H cosθ.  If v1 = 

- 15 -


v2  then  the  force  ratio  f1/f2  =  tan  θ,  yielding  θ  within  the  xˆ - yˆ   plane,  plus  the  value  of  H:  H  = 
f1/(qμov1  sin  θ).  There  is  no  other  physical method  for  detecting  or measuring  static  electric  or 
magnetic fields; we can only measure the forces on charges or on charged bodies, or measure the 
consequences of that force, e.g., by measuring the resulting currents.

It  is  helpful  to  have  a  simple  physical  picture  of  how  fields  behave  so  that  their  form  and 
behavior  can  be  guessed  or  approximately  understood  without  recourse  to  mathematical 
solutions.  Such  physical  pictures  can  be  useful  even  if  they  are  completely  unrelated  to  reality, 
provided  that  they  predict  all  observations  in  a  simple  way.    Since  the  Lorentz  force  law  plus 
Maxwell’s  equations  explain  essentially  all  non-relativistic  and  non-quantum  electromagnetic 
behavior  in  a  simple  way  using  the  fields⎯E  and⎯H,  we  need  only  to  ascertain  how⎯E  and⎯H 
behave given a particular distribution of stationary or moving charges q. 

First  consider  static  distributions  of  charge.    Electric  field  lines  are  parallel  to⎯E,  and  the 
strength  of⎯E  is  proportional  to  the  density  of  those  field  lines.    Electric  field  lines  begin  on 
positive  charges  and  terminate  on  negative  ones,  and  the  more  charge  there  is,  the  more  field 
lines there are.  Field strength is proportional to lines per square meter.  These lines pull on those 
charges  to which  they  are  attached, whether  positive  or  negative, much  as would  a  rubber  band. 
Like rubber bands,  they would also  like  to  take  the shortest path between  two points, except  that 
they also tend to repel their neighbors laterally, as do the charges to which they are attached.

Figure 1.2.2  Electric field lines between two conducting cylinders. 
 

Figure  1.2.2  illustrates  the  results  of  this  mutual  field-line  repulsion,  even  as  they  pull  opposite 
charges  on  conducting  cylinders  toward  one  another.  Later we  shall  see  that  such  electric  field 

- 16 -


lines  are  always  perpendicular  to  perfectly  conducting  surfaces.    Although  these  lines  are 
illustrated as discrete, they actually are a continuum, even if only two charges are involved. 

The  same  intuition  applies  to  magnetic  field  lines⎯H.  For  example,  Figure  1.2.2  would 
apply  if  the  two cylinders corresponded  instead  to  the north  (+)  and  south  (-) poles of  a magnet, 
and  if⎯E became⎯H, although⎯H need not emerge perfectly perpendicular  to  the magnet surface. 
In  this  case  too  the  field  lines  would  physically  pull  the  two  magnet  poles  toward  one  another. 
Both electric and magnetic motors can be driven using either the attractive force along field lines 
or the lateral repulsive force between lines, depending on motor design, as discussed later. 

Another  intuitive  picture  applies  to  time-dependent  electromagnetic  waves,  where 
distributions of position-dependent electric and magnetic fields at right angles propagate as plane 
waves  in  the  direction⎯E  ×⎯H  much  like  a  rigid  body  at  the  speed  of  light  c,  ~3×108  m/s. 
Because electromagnetic waves can superimpose, it can be shown that any distribution of electric 
and  magnetic  fields  can  be  considered  merely  as  the  superposition  of  such  plane  waves.    Such 
plane waves  are  introduced  in  Section  2.2.    If we  examine  such  superpositions  on  spatial  scales 
small  compared  to  a  wavelength,  both  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  behave  much  as  they 
would in the static case. 

Example 1.2A 
A  typical  old  vacuum  tube  accelerates  electrons  in  a  ~104  v  m-1  electric  field.  What  is  the 
resulting  electron  velocity  v(t)  if  it  starts  from  rest?   How  long  (τ)  does  it  take  the  electron  to 
transit the 1-cm tube? 

Solution:  	 Force  f  = ma  =  qE,  and  so  v  =  at  =  qEt/m  ≅  1.6×10-19×104  t/(9.1×10-28)  ≅  1.8×1012  t 
[m  s-1].  Obviously v  cannot  exceed  the  speed of  light  c, ~3×108 m/s.    In  this  text we 
deal  only  with  non-relativistic  electrons  traveling  much  slower  than  c.    Distance 
traveled  =  d  =  aτ2/2  =  0.01,  so  the  transit  time  τ  =  (2d/a)0.5  =  (2dm/qE)0.5  ≅ 
[2×0.01×9.1×10-28/(1.6×10-19×104)]0.5  ≅  1.1×10-7  seconds.  This  slow  transit  limited 
most  vacuum  tubes  to  signal  frequencies  below  several  megahertz,  although  smaller 
gaps  and  higher  voltages  have  enabled  simple  tubes  to  reach  100  MHz  and  higher. 
The  microscopic  gaps  of  semiconductors  can  eliminate  transit  time  as  an  issue  for 
most  applications  below  1  GHz;  other  phenomena  often  determine  the  frequency 
range instead. 

1.3  Gauss’s Law and electrostatic fields and potentials 

While  the  Lorentz  force  law  defines  how  electric  and  magnetic  fields  can  be  observed, 
Maxwell’s  four  equations  explain  how  these  fields  can  be  created  directly  from  charges  and 
currents,  or  indirectly  and  equivalently  from  other  time  varying  fields.    One  of  those  four 
equations  is  Gauss’s  Law  for  charge,  which  states  that  the  total  charge  Q  [Coulombs]  within 
volume  V  equals  the  integral  of  the  normal  component  of  the  electric  displacement  vector⎯D 
over the surface area A of that volume:

In vacuum: 

D = εo E 

(1.3.2)
 

where  the  permittivity  of  vacuum  ε   =  8.854×10-12
  Farads/m.    Equation  (1.3.1)  reveals  the 
o
dimensions of⎯D: Coulombs/m2, often abbreviated here as [C/m2]. 

A few simple examples illustrate typical electric fields for common charge distributions, and 
how  Gauss’s  law  can  be  used  to  compute  those  fields.    First  consider  a  sphere  of  radius  R 
uniformly filled with charge of density ρo [C/m3], as illustrated in Figure 1.3.1(a).

The  symmetry of  the  solution must match  the  spherical  symmetry of  the problem,  so⎯E must be 
independent  of  θ  and  φ,  although  it  can  depend  on  radius  r.   This  symmetry  requires  that⎯E  be 
radial and, more particularly: 

⎯E(r,θ,φ) =  rE(r)

  [V/m] 

(1.3.3) 

We can find⎯E(r) by substituting  (1.3.3) into (1.3.1).  First consider r > R, for which (1.3.1) 
becomes: 

4πr2εo E(r)  = (4/3)πR3ρo = Q 

⎯E(r) =  rˆ

(1.3.7) 

It  is  interesting  to  compare  this  dependence  of⎯E  on  r  with  that  for  cylindrical  geometries, 
which  are  also  illustrated  in  Figure  1.3.1.  We  assume  a  uniform  charge  density  of  ρo  within 
radius R, corresponding to Λ coulombs/meter.  Substitution of (1.3.4) into (1.3.1) yields: 

2πrWεo E(r)  = πR2ροW = ΛW  [C]  (r > R)

(1.3.9)

Inside the cylinder (r < R) the right-hand-side of (1.3.9) still applies, but with R2 replaced with r2, 
so⎯E(r) =  rˆ rρο/2εο instead. 

To  find  the  voltage  difference,  often  called  the  difference  in  electrical  potential  Φ  or  the 
potential  difference,  between  two  points  in  space  [V], we  can  simply  integrate  the  static  electric 
field⎯E• rˆ   [V/m]  along  the  field  line⎯E  connecting  them.   Thus  in  the  spherical  case  the voltage 
difference Φ(r1) - Φ(r2) between points at r1 and at r2 > r1 is: 

Φ(r1) - Φ(r2) =

(1.3.10)

If we want  to assign an absolute value  to electrical potential or voltage V at a given  location, we 
usually  define  the  potential Φ  to  be  zero  at  r2  = ∞,  so  a  spherical  charge Q  produces  an  electric 
potential Φ(r) for r > R which is: 

Φ(r) = Q/4πεor  [V] 

(1.3.11) 

The  same  computation  for  the  cylindrical  charge  of  Figure  1.3.1  and  the  field  of  (1.3.9)

A  third  simple  geometry  is  that  of  charged  infinite  parallel  conducting  plates  separated  by 
distance  d,  where  the  inner-facing  surfaces  of  the  upper  and  lower  plates  have  surface  charge 
density  +ρs  and  -ρs  [C/m2],  respectively,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  1.3.2  for  finite  plates.    The 
uniformity  of  infinite  plates  with  respect  to  x,  y,  and  φ  requires  that  the  solution⎯E  also  be 
independent  of  x,  y,  and  φ.  The  symmetry  with  respect  to  φ  requires  that⎯E  point  in  the  ±z 
direction.  Gauss’s  law  (1.3.1)  then  requires  that⎯E  be  independent  of  z  because  the  integrals 
of⎯D  over  the  top  and  bottom  surfaces  of  any  rectangular  volume  located  between  the  plates 
must cancel since there is no charge within such a volume and no⎯D passing through its sides.

This solution  for⎯E  is consistent with  the rubber-band model  for  field  lines, which suggests 
that  the  excess  positive  and  negative  charges  will  be  mutually  attracted,  and  therefore  will  be 
pulled to the inner surfaces of the two plates, particularly if the gap d between the plates is small 
compared  to  their  width.    Gauss’s  Law  (1.3.1)  also  tells  us  that  the  displacement  vector⎯D 
integrated  over  a  surface  enclosing  the  entire  structure  must  be  zero  because  the  integrated 
charge  within  that  surface  is  zero;  that  is,  the  integrated  positive  charge,  ρsA,  balances  the 
integrated  negative  charge,  - ρsA  and⎯D  external  to  the  device  can  be  zero  everywhere.    The 
electric potential difference V between the two plates can be found by integrating⎯E between the 
two plates.  That is, V = Eod volts for any path of integration, where Eo = ρs/εo by Gauss’s law. 

Although  the  voltage  difference  between  equipotentials  can  be  computed  by  integrating 
along the electric field lines themselves, as done above, it is easy to show that the result does not 
 
depend on the path of integration.  Assume there are two different paths of integration P1 and P2 
between any  two points of  interest, and  that  the  two  resulting voltage differences are V1 and V2. 
Now  consider  the  closed  contour  C  of  integration  that  is  along  path  P1  in  the  positive  direction 
and  along  P2  in  the  reverse  direction  so  as  to  make  a  closed  loop.    Since  this  contour  integral 
must yield zero, as  shown below  in  (1.3.13) using Faraday’s  law  for  the  static case where ∂/∂t = 
0, it follows that V1 = V2 and that all paths of integration yield the same voltage difference.

In  summary,  electric  fields  decay  as  1/r2  from  spherical  charge  concentrations,  as  1/r  from 
cylindrical  ones,  and  are  uniform  in  planar  geometries.    The  corresponding  electric  potentials 
decay  as  1/r,  -ln  r,  and  x,  respectively,  as  a  result  of  integration  over  distance.    The  potential Φ 
for  the  cylindrical  case  becomes  infinite  as  r→∞  because  the  cylinder  is  infinitely  long;  the 
expression  for  the  potential  difference  between  concentric  cylinders  of  finite  radius  is  valid, 
however.  Within  both  uniform  spherical  and  cylindrical  charge  distributions  the  electric  field 
increases from zero linearly with radius r.  In each case the electric field distribution is explained 
by  the rubber-band model  in which  the rubber bands (field  lines) repel each other  laterally while 
being pulled on by opposite electric charges. 

It  is  extremely  useful  to  note  that  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  so  that  superposition 
applies.  That is, the total electric field⎯E equals that due to the sum of all charges present, where 
the  contribution  to⎯E  from  each  charge  Q  is  given  by  (1.3.5).    Electric  potentials  Φ  also 
superimpose, where the contribution from each charge Q is given by (1.3.11).

Ampere’s Law and magnetostatic fields 

The  relevant  Maxwell’s  equation  for  static  current  densities⎯J  [A/m2]  is  Ampere’s  law,  which 
says that for time-invariant cases the integral of magnetic field⎯H around any closed contour in a 
right-hand  sense  equals  the  area  integral  of  current  density⎯J  [A/m2]  flowing  through  that 
contour:

Figure  1.4.1  illustrates  a  simple  cylindrical  geometry  for  which  we  can  readily  compute⎯H 
produced  by  current  I;  the  radius  of  the  cylinder  is  R  and  the  uniform  current  density  flowing 
through it is Jo [A/m2].  The cylinder is infinitely long.

Because  the  problem  is  cylindrically  symmetric  (not  a  function  of  θ),  and  uniform  with 
respect  to  the  cylindrical  axis  z,  so  is  the  solution.  Thus⎯H  depends  only  upon  radius  r.

where  the  total  current  I  is  simply  the  uniform  current  density  Jo  times  the  area  πR2  of  the

Therefore  H(r)  increases  linearly  with  r  within  the  wire  and  current  distribution,  and  is 
continuous at r = R, where both (1.4.3) and (1.4.5) agree that H(r) = JoR/2. 

Another  simple  geometry  involves  parallel  plates.    Assume  equal  and  opposite  current 
densities, Js [A/m], flow in infinite parallel plates separated by distance d, as illustrated in Figure 
1.4.2  for  finite  plates. The  integral  of Ampere’s  law  (1.4.1)  around  any  contour C1  circling  both 
plates  is  zero  because  the  net  current  through  that  contour  is  zero.    A  non-zero  integral  would 
require  an  external  source  of  field,  which  we  assume  does  not  exist  here.    Thus⎯H  above  and 
below  the  plates  is  zero.  Since  the  integral  of  (1.4.1)  around  any  contour  C2  that  circles  the 
upper  plate  yields HxW  =  JsW, where  the  x  component  of  the magnetic  field  anywhere  between 
the plates is Hx = Js [A/m]; thus the magnetic field⎯H between the plates is uniform.  An integral 
around  any  contour  in  any  y-z  plane  would  circle  no  net  current,  so  Hz  =  0,  and  a  similar 
argument  applies  to  Hy,  which  is  also  zero.  This  configuration  is  discussed  further  in  Section 
3.2.1.

More  generally,  because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  the  total  magnetic  field⎯H  at  any 
location  is  the  integral of contributions made by current densities⎯J nearby.  Section 10.1 proves 
the  Biot-Savart  law  (1.4.6),  which  defines  how  a  current  distribution⎯J'  at  position⎯r'  within

To  summarize,  electric  and  magnetic  fields  are  simple  fictions  that  explain  all 
electromagnetic  behavior  as  characterized  by  Maxwell’s  equations  and  the  Lorentz  force  law, 
which  are  examined  further  in  Chapter  2.    A  simple  physical  model  for  the  static  behavior  of 
 
electric  fields  is  that  of  rubber  bands  that  tend  to  pull  opposite  electric  charges  toward  one 
another,  but  that  tend  to  repel  neighboring  field  lines  laterally.    Static  magnetic  fields  behave 
similarly,  except  that  the  role  of  magnetic  charges  (which  have  not  been  shown  to  exist)  is 
replaced by current loops acting as magnetic dipoles in ways that are discussed later.

Chapter 2:  Introduction to Electrodynamics 

2.1  Maxwell’s differential equations in the time domain 

Whereas  the  Lorentz  force  law  characterizes  the  observable  effects  of  electric  and  magnetic 
fields  on  charges,  Maxwell’s  equations  characterize  the  origins  of  those  fields  and  their 
relationships to each other.  The simplest representation of Maxwell’s equations is in differential 
form, which leads directly to waves; the alternate integral form is presented in Section 2.4.3. 

The differential form uses the vector del operator ∇: 

∂ 
∇ ≡ xˆ 
∂x 

+ yˆ 

∂

(2.1.1)
 

where  xˆ ,  yˆ  ,  and  zˆ   are  defined  as  unit  vectors  in  cartesian  coordinates.    Relations  involving ∇ 
are  summarized  in  Appendix  D.    Here  we  use  the  conventional  vector  dot  product1  and  cross 
product2 of ∇ with the electric and magnetic field vectors where, for example: 

E = xˆE x  + yˆE y  + zˆE z 

∇ • E ≡

We  call  ∇ • E   the  divergence  of  E   because  it  is  a  measure  of  the  degree  to  which  the  vector 
field⎯E diverges or flows outward from any position.  The cross product is defined as:

These  four  Maxwell  equations  invoke  one  scalar  and  five  vector  quantities  comprising  16 
variables.    Some variables only  characterize how matter  alters  field behavior,  as discussed  later 
 
in Section 2.5.  In vacuum we can eliminate three vectors (9 variables) by noting:

where εo = 8.8542×10-12  [farads m-1]  is  the permittivity of vacuum, μo = 4π×10-7  [henries m-1]  is 
the  permeability  of  vacuum3,  v   is  the  velocity  of  the  local  net  charge  density  ρ,  and  σ  is  the 
conductivity  of  a  medium  [Siemens  m-1].  If  we  regard  the  electrical  sources  ρ  and  J   as  given, 
then  the  equations  can  be  solved  for  all  remaining  unknowns.   Specifically, we  can  then  find  E 
and  H ,  and  thus  compute  the  forces  on  all  charges  present.    Except  for  special  cases  we  shall 
avoid  solving  problems  where  the  electromagnetic  fields  and  the  motions  of  ρ  are 
interdependent. 

The  constitutive  relations  for  vacuum,  D = ε0 E  and  B = μ0 H ,  can  be  generalized  to 
D = εE ,  B = μH , and  J = σE  for simple media.  Media are discussed further in Section 2.5. 

Maxwell’s equations require conservation of charge.  By taking the divergence of Ampere’s 
law (2.1.6) and noting the vector identity  ∇ • ∇(  × A  ) = 0 , we find:

∂D 
∇ • (
   ∇ × H  ) = 0 = ∇ • 
+ ∇ • J 
∂t 

(2.1.18)

Then,  by  reversing  the  sequence  of  the  derivatives  in  (2.1.18)  and  substituting  Gauss’s  law 
∇ • D = ρ  (2.1.7), we obtain the differential expression for conservation of charge: 

∂ρ 
∇ • J = − 
∂t 

(conservation of charge) 

(2.1.19)

The  integral  expression  can  be  derived  from  the  differential  expression  by  using  Gauss’s 
divergence  theorem,  which  relates  the  integral  of  ∇ • G over  any  volume  V  to  the  integral  of 
G • nˆ   over  the  surface  area  A  of  that  volume,  where  the  surface  normal  unit  vector  nˆ   points

Electromagnetic waves in the time domain 

Perhaps  the greatest  triumph of Maxwell’s equations was  their ability  to predict  in a simple way 
the existence and velocity of electromagnetic waves based on simple laboratory measurements of 
the  permittivity  and  permeability  of  vacuum.    In  vacuum  the  charge  density  ρ  =⎯J  =  0,  and  so 
Maxwell’s equations become:

We  can  eliminate  H   from  these  equations  by  computing  the  curl  of  Faraday’s  law,  which

often called the Helmholtz wave equation:

The  solutions  to  this  wave  equation  (2.2.7)  are  any  fields  E ( r , t )   for  which  the  second 
spatial  derivative  (∇ 2 E )   equals  a  constant  times  the  second  time  derivative  (  2  ∂ 2   ) .  The 
∂  E t
position  vector  r ≡ xˆx + yˆy + zˆz .  The  wave  equation  is  therefore  satisfied  by  any  arbitrary 
E ( r , t )   having  identical  dependence  on  space  and  time  within  a  constant  multiplier.    For 
example, arbitrary functions of  the arguments (z - ct), (z + ct), or (t ± z/c) have such an  identical 
dependence  and  are  among  the  valid  solutions  to  (2.2.7),  where  c  is  some  constant  to  be 
determined.  One such solution is: 

E ( r, t  ) = E ( z − ct  ) = x ˆE  (

again  at  some  later  time  t.    Note  that  as  time  advances  within  the  argument  (z  -  ct),  z  must

(2.2.12) 

Figure  2.2.1  illustrates  how  an  arbitrary  E(z, t )   can  propagate  by  translating  at  velocity  c. 
However, some caution is warranted when  E(z, t )  is defined.  Although our trial solution (2.2.9) 
satisfies  the  wave  equation  (2.2.7),  it  may  not  satisfy  Gauss’s  laws.    For  example,  consider  the 
case where: 

E ( z, t  ) = zˆEz ( z − ct  ) 

Then Gauss’s law  ∇ • E = 0  is not satisfied: 

∇ • E = Ez  ≠ 0  for arbitrary  E z( ) 
∂
∂z

(2.2.13) 

(2.2.14) 

In contrast, if  E(z, t )  is oriented perpendicular to the direction of propagation (in the  xˆ  and/or  yˆ 
directions for z-directed propagation), then all Maxwell’s equations are satisfied and the solution 
is  valid.  In  the  case  E ( z,
 t  ) =  yˆE  ( z − ct  )
,  independent  of  x  and  y,  we  have  a  uniform  plane 
y 
wave  because  the  fields  are  uniform  with  respect  to  two  of  the  coordinates  (x,y)  so  that 
E x 
∂ ∂ = ∂  ∂ =  0 .  Since  this  electric  field  is  in  the  y  direction,  it  is  said  to  be  y-polarized;  by 
E y 
convention,  polarization  of  a  wave  refers  to  the  direction  of  its  electric  vector.    Polarization  is 
discussed further in Section 2.3.4. 

Knowing  E ( z, t  ) =  yˆ E (y z − ct  )   for  this  example,  we  can  now  find  H (z, t )   using  Faraday’s 
 
law (2.2.1):

Thus  E   and  H   in  a  uniform  plane  wave  are  very  simply  related.    Their  directions  are

(2.2.19) 

Electromagnetic waves can propagate  in any arbitrary direction  in  space with arbitrary  time 
behavior.  That  is,  we  are  free  to  define  xˆ ,  yˆ  ,  and  zˆ   in  this  example  as  being  in  any  three 
orthogonal  directions  in  space.    Because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear  in  field  strength, 
superposition  applies  and  any  number  of  plane  waves  propagating  in  arbitrary  directions  with 
arbitrary  polarizations  can  be  superimposed  to  yield  valid  electromagnetic  solutions.    Exactly 
which  superposition  is  the  valid  solution  in  any  particular  case  depends  on  the  boundary 
conditions and  the  initial conditions for  that case, as discussed  later  in Chapter 9  for a variety of 
geometries.

2.3.1 

Sinusoidal waves 

Linear systems are easily characterized by  the magnitude and phase of each output as a  function 
of  the  frequency  at  which  the  input  is  sinusoidally  stimulated.    This  simple  characterization  is 
sufficient  because  sinusoids  of  different  frequencies  can  be  superimposed  to  construct  any 
arbitrary  input waveform5, and  the output of a  linear  system  is  the  superposition of  its  responses 
to  each  superimposed  input.    Systems  with  multiple  inputs  and  outputs  can  be  characterized  in 
the  same  way.  Nonlinear  systems  are  more  difficult  to  characterize  because  their  output 
frequencies generally include harmonics of their inputs. 

Fortunately  free  space  is  a  linear  system,  and  therefore  it  is  fully  characterized  by  its 
response  to  sinusoidal  plane  waves.  For  example,  the  arbitrary  z-propagating  x-polarized 
uniform plane wave of (2.2.9) and Figure 2.2.1 could be sinusoidal and represented by: 
E r( , t  ) = xˆE  o cos  ⎡ k ( z −

⎤

(2.3.2)

where  the  wave  amplitude  Eo  is  a  constant  and  the  factor  k  is  related  to  frequency,  as  shown 
below. 

It  is more  common  to  represent  sinusoidal waves  using  the  argument  (ωt  -  kz)  so  that  their 
frequency and spatial dependences are more evident.   The angular  frequency ω  is simply related 
to frequency f [Hz]: 

ω = 2πf  [radians s-1] 

(angular frequency) 

(2.3.3) 

4 Q.E.D. is the abbreviation for the Latin phrase “quod erat demonstratum” or “that which was to be demonstrated.” 
5 The Fourier transform pair (10.4.17) and (10.4.18) relate arbitrary pulse waveforms h(t) to their corresponding 
spectra H(f), where each frequency f has its own magnitude and phase represented by H(f). 

- 30 -


and  the spatial  frequency k, often called  the wavenumber,  is simply related  to ω and wavelength 
λ [m], which is the length of one period in space: 

k = 2π/λ = ω/c  [radians m-1] 

(wave number) 

(2.3.4) 

The  significance  and  dimensions  of  ω  and  k  are  directly  analogous;  they  are  radians  s-1  and 
radians m-1, respectively. 

Therefore we can alternatively represent the wave of (2.3.1) and (2.3.2) as:

Figure  2.3.1  suggests  the  form  of  this  wave.    Its  wavelength  is  λ,  the  length  of  one  cycle, 
where: 

λ = c/f  [m] 

(wavelength) 

(2.3.7) 

The  figure  illustrates  how  these  electric  and magnetic  fields  are  in  phase  but  orthogonal  to  each 
other  and  to  the  direction  of  propagation.   When  the  argument  (ωt  –  kz)  equals  zero,  the  fields 
are maximum, consistent with cos(ωt - kz).

2.3.2  Maxwell’s equations in the complex-frequency domain 

Electromagnetic  fields  are  commonly  characterized  in  the  frequency  domain  in  terms  of  their 
magnitudes  and  phases  as  a  function  of  position  r   for  frequency  f.    For  example,  the  xˆ
component of a general sinusoidally varying  E  might be:  

E(

)r ,t  = xˆE ( ) 
x r  cos  ⎣ω  t + φ(r)⎤⎦

m  plane  wave  propagating  in  the  +z 

It  is  generally more  convenient  to  express  phase  using  complex  notation  (see Appendix B).

called a phasor.  The simplicity will arise  later when we omit  R e {[ ] e j

as  “understood”,  so  only  the  phasors  remain.    The  underbar  under  E x  indicates  E x  is  not  a

The  other  Maxwell  equations  can  be  similarly  transformed,  which  suggests  that  the  notation

e {[ ] e j
 
t
ω
R
notation  from  (2.3.15)  results  in:  ∇ × E = − j ωB   .  Any  problem  solution  expressed  as  a  phasor, 
e.g.  E ( )r  ,  can  be  converted  back  into  a  time-domain  expression  by  the  operator  R {[ ]  ω
 } .

These  omissions  of  the  understood  notation  result  in  the  complex  or  time-harmonic  Maxwell

replaced the operator ∂/∂t with jω and placed an underbar under all variables, signifying that they 
are now phasors. 

We  can  immediately  derive  the  time-harmonic  equation  for  conservation  of  charge  (2.1.19) 
by computing the divergence of (2.3.17), noting that  ∇ • ∇( × A  ) = 0  for any  A , and substituting

Sinusoidal uniform plane waves 

We  can  readily  derive  from  Maxwell’s  equations  the  time-harmonic  Helmholtz  wave  equation 
for  vacuum  (2.2.7)  by  substituting  jω  for  ∂/∂t  or,  as  we  did  earlier,  by  taking  the  curl  of 
Faraday’s  law,  using  the  well  known  vector  identity  (2.2.6)  and  Gauss’s  law,  replacing  B   by 
μo H ,  and  using  Ampere’s  law  to  replace  ∇ × H .  In  both  cases  the  Helmholtz  wave  equation 
becomes:

As  before,  the  solution  E ( )r   to  the  wave  equation  can  be  any  arbitrary  function  of  space

It  is  easy  to  convert phasor  expressions  such  as  (2.3.26)  into  time-domain  expressions.   We 
simply  divide  the  phasor  expressions  into  their  real  and  imaginary  parts,  and  note  that  the  real 
part  varies  as  cos(ωt  -  kz)  and  the  imaginary  part  varies  as  sin(ωt  -  kz).  Thus  the  fields  in 
(2.3.22) could be written instead as a real time-domain expression:

The  conversion  of  complex  phasors  to  time-domain  expressions,  and  vice-versa,  is  discussed 
further in Appendix B. 

2.3.4  Wave polarization 

Complex  notation  simplifies  the  representation  of  wave  polarization,  which  characterizes  the 
behavior of the sinusoidally varying electric field vector as a function of time.  It is quite distinct 
from  the  polarization  of  media  discussed  in  Section  2.5.3.    Previously  we  have  seen  waves  for 
which  the  time-varying  electric vector points only  in  the ±x, ±y, or ±z directions,  corresponding 
to x, y, or z polarization, respectively.   By superimposing such waves at  the same frequency and 
propagating  in  the  same  direction  we  can  obtain  any  other  desired  time-harmonic  polarization. 
Linear  polarization  results  when  the  oscillating  electric  vector  points  only  along  a  single 
direction  in  the  plane  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  propagation,  while  elliptical  polarization 
results when  the x and y components of  the electric vector are out of phase  so  that  the  tip of  the 
electric  vector  traces  an  ellipse  in  the  same  plane.    Circular  polarization  results  only  when  the 
phase difference between x and y is 90 degrees and the two amplitudes are equal.  These various 
polarizations  for  +zˆ   propagation  are  represented  below  at  z  =  0  in  the  time  domain  and  as 
phasors, and in Figure 2.3.2.

The  Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics  Engineers  (IEEE)  has  defined  polarization  as 
right-handed  if  the  electric  vector  traces  a  right-handed  ellipse  in  the  x-y  plane  for  a  wave 
propagating  in  the  +z  direction,  as  suggested  in  Figure  2.3.3.    That  is,  for  right-handed 
polarization the fingers of the right hand circle in the direction taken by the electric vector while 
the thumb points in the direction of propagation.  This legal definition is opposite that commonly 
used in physics, where that alternative definition is consistent with the handedness of the “screw” 
formed by  the  instantaneous  three-dimensional  loci of  the  tips of  the electric vectors comprising 
a wave.

Relation between integral and differential forms of Maxwell’s equations 

2.4.1  Gauss’s divergence theorem 

Two  theorems  are  very  useful  in  relating  the  differential  and  integral  forms  of  Maxwell’s 
equations:  Gauss’s  divergence  theorem  and  Stokes  theorem.    Gauss’s  divergence  theorem 
(2.1.20)  states  that  the  integral  of  the  normal  component  of  an  arbitrary  analytic  vector  field  A 
over  a  surface  S  that  bounds  the  volume  V  equals  the  volume  integral  of  ∇ • A   over  V.  The 
theorem can be derived quickly by recalling (2.1.3):

Stokes’ theorem states that the integral of the curl of a vector field over a bounded surface equals 
the  line  integral  of  that  vector  field  along  the  contour C  bounding  that  surface.   Its  derivation  is 
similar  to  that  for Gauss’s divergence  theorem  (Section 2.4.1), starting with  the definition of  the

(2.4.10)

where  ds   is  a  vector  differential  length  [m]  along  the  contour  C  bounding  the  incremental  area 
defined by ΔxΔy = da.  The contour C is transversed in a right-hand sense relative to  nˆ .  We can 
assemble such infinitesimal areas to form surfaces of arbitrary shapes and area A, as suggested in 
Figure  2.4.2(b).  When  we  sum  (2.4.10)  over  all  these  infinitesimal  areas  da,  we  find  that  all 
contributions  to  the  right-hand  side  interior  to  the  area  A  cancel,  leaving  only  the  contributions 
from contour C along the border of A.  Thus (2.4.10) becomes Stokes’ theorem:

where  the  relation  between  the  direction  of  integration  around  the  loop  and  the  orientation  of  nˆ 
obey  the  right-hand  rule  (if  the  right-hand  fingers  curl  in  the  direction  of  ds ,  then  the  thumb

2.4.3  Maxwell’s equations in integral form 

The  differential  form  of Maxwell’s  equations  (2.1.5–8)  can  be  converted  to  integral  form  using 
Gauss’s divergence theorem and Stokes’ theorem.  Faraday’s law (2.1.5) is: 

∇ × E = − ∂B 
∂t 

(2.4.12)

Applying Stokes’ theorem (2.4.11) to the curved surface A bounded by the contour C, we obtain: 

(∇ × E ) • nˆ  da = (cid:118)∫C
∫∫A 
This becomes the integral form of Faraday’s law:

The  four  sketches  of  Maxwell’s  equations  presented  in  Figure  2.4.3  may  facilitate 
memorization; they can be interpreted  in either differential or  integral form because  they capture 
the underlying physics. 

Example 2.4A 
Using Gauss’s law, find  E  at distance r from a point charge q. 

Solution:  	 The  spherical  symmetry  of  the  problem  requires  E   to  be  radial,  and  Gauss’s  law 
ρ dv = q = 4πr 2εoE r , so  E = rˆE r  = rˆq

Example 2.4B 
What is⎯H at r = 1 cm from a line current  I

z= ˆ  [amperes] positioned at r = 0? 

Solution:	 Because  the  geometry  of  this  problem  is  cylindrically  symmetric,  so  is  the  solution. 
Using  the  integral  form  of  Ampere’s  law  (2.4.15)  and  integrating  in  a  right-hand 
sense  around  a  circle  of  radius  r  centered  on  the  current  and  in  a  plane  orthogonal  to 
it, we obtain 2πrH = I, so⎯H =  θˆ 100/2π [A m-1].

Electric and magnetic fields in media 

2.5.1  Maxwell’s equations and media 

The  great  success  of  Maxwell’s  equations  lies  partly  in  their  simple  prediction  of 
electromagnetic  waves  and  their  simple  characterization  of  materials  in  terms  of  conductivity 
σ [Siemens  m-1],  permittivity  ε  [Farads  m-1],  and  permeability  μ  [Henries  m-1].  In  vacuum  we 
find  σ  =  0,  ε  =  εo,  and  μ  =  μo,  where  εo  =  8.8542×10-12  and  μo  =  4π×10-7.  For  reference, 
Maxwell’s equations are:

(2.5.6) 

(2.5.7) 

In  contrast,  the  nano-structure  of  media  can  be  quite  complex  and  requires  quantum 
mechanics  for  its  full  explanation.    Fortunately,  simple  classical  approximations  to  atoms  and 
molecules suffice to understand the origins of σ, ε, and μ, as discussed below in that sequence. 

2.5.2  Conductivity 

Conduction  in  metals  and  n-type  semiconductors6  involves  free  electrons  moving  many  atomic 
diameters before they lose momentum by interacting with atoms or other particles.  Acceleration 
induced  by  the  small  applied  electric  field  inside  the  conductor  restores  electron  velocities  to 
produce  an  equilibrium  current.    The  total  current  density  J   [A  m-2]  is  proportional  to  the 
product  of  the  average  electron  velocity  v   [m  s-1]  and  the  number  density  n  [m-3]  of  free 
electrons.  A related conduction process occurs in ionic liquids, where both negative and positive 
ions can carry charge long distances.

In  metals  there  is  approximately  one  free  electron  per  atom,  and  in  warm  n-type 
 
semiconductors  there  is approximately one free electron per donor atom, where  the sparse donor 
atoms are easily ionized thermally.  Since, for non-obvious reasons, the average electron velocity 
 
is proportional  to  E ,  therefore  J = −en
v
v
= σE , as  stated  in  (2.5.7).   As  the conductivity 
3 
σ  approaches  infinity  the  electric  field  inside  a  conductor  approaches  zero  for  any  given  current 
density  J . 

Warm donor  atoms  in n-type  semiconductors  can be  easily  ionized  and  contribute  electrons 
to  the  conduction  band where  they move  freely.   Only  certain  types  of  impurity  atoms  function 
as donors--those that are most easily ionized.  As the density of donor atoms approaches zero and 
as  temperature  declines,  the  number  of  free  electrons  and  the  conductivity  approach  very  low 
values that depend on temperature and any alternative ionization mechanisms that are present.

In  p-type  semiconductors  the  added  impurity  atoms  readily  trap  nearby  free  electrons  to 
 
produce  a  negative  ion;  this  results  in  a  corresponding  number  of  positively  ionized 
semiconductor atoms that act as “holes”.  As a result any free electrons typically move only short 
distances before they are trapped by one of these holes.  Moreover, the threshold energy required 
to  move  an  electron  from  a  neutral  atom  to  an  adjacent  positive  ion  is  usually  less  than  the 
available  thermal energy, so such  transfers occur  rapidly, causing  the hole  to move quickly  from 

6 n-type semiconductors (e.g., silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, and others) are doped with a 
tiny  percentage  of  donor  atoms  that  ionize  easily  at  temperatures  of  interest,  releasing  mobile  electrons  into  the 
conduction  band  of  the  semiconductor  where  they  can  travel  freely  across  the  material  until  they  recombine  with 
another  ionized  donor  atom.    The  conduction  band  is  not  a  place;  it  refers  instead  to  an  energy  and  wave  state  of 
electrons  that  enables  them  to  move  freely.    The  conductivity  of  semiconductors  therefore  increases  with 
temperature;  they  become  relatively  insulating  at  low  temperatures,  depending  on  the  ionization  potentials  of  the 
impurity atoms. 

- 42 -


place  to  place  over  long  distances.    Thus  holes  are  the  dominant  charge  carriers  in  p-type 
semiconductors, whereas electrons dominate in n-type semiconductors. 

  More  broadly,  semiconductors  have  a  conduction  band  in  which  free  electrons  can 
propagate long distances; this band is separated by an energy of one or a few electron volts from 
the valence band  in which electrons cannot move.   The conduction band  is not a  location,  it  is a 
family of possible electron wave states.  When electrons are excited from the valence band to the 
conduction  band  by  some  energetic  process,  they  become  free  to  move  in  response  to  electric 
fields.  Semiconductor conductivity is approximately proportional to the number of free electrons 
or  holes  produced  by  the  scarce  impurity  atoms,  and  therefore  to  the  doping  density  of  those 
impurity  atoms.   Easily  ionized  impurity  atoms  are  the  principal mechanism  by which  electrons 
enter  the  conduction  band,  and  impurities  that  readily  trap  adjacent  electrons  are  the  principal 
mechanism  by which  holes  enter  and move  in  the  valence  band.    Semiconductors  are  discussed 
further  in  Section  8.2.4.  The  current  leakage  processes  in  insulators  vaguely  resemble  electron 
and  hole  conduction  in  semiconductors,  and  can  include  weak  surface  currents  as  well  as  bulk 
conduction;  microscopic  flaws  can  also  increase  conductivity.  The  conductivities  of  typical 
materials are listed in Table 2.5.1.

In  some  exotic  materials  the  conductivity  is  a  function  of  direction  and  can  be  represented 
by  the  3×3 matrix  σ ;  such materials  are  not  addressed  here,  but  Section  2.5.3  addresses  similar 
issues in the context of permittivity ε. 

Some  materials  exhibit  superconductivity,  or  infinite  conductivity.    In  these materials  pairs 
 
of  electrons  become  loosely  bound  magnetically  and  move  as  a  unit  called  a  Cooper  pair. 
Quantum  mechanics  prevents  these  pairs  from  colliding  with  the  lattice  and  losing  energy. 
Because  the  magnetic  binding  energy  for  these  pairs  involves  electron  spins,  it  is  quite  small. 
Normal conductivity returns above a threshold critical temperature at which the pairs are shaken 
apart,  and  it  also  returns  above  some  threshold  critical  magnetic  field  at  which  the  magnetic 
bonds  coupling  the  electrons  break  as  the  electron  spins  all  start  to  point  in  the  same  direction. 
Materials  having  critical  temperatures  above  77K  (readily  obtained  in  cryogenic  refrigerators) 
are  difficult  to  achieve.    The  finite  number  of  such  pairs  at  any  temperature  and  magnetic  field 
limits the current to some maximum value; moreover that current itself produces a magnetic field 
that can disrupt pairs.  Even a few pairs can move so as to reduce electric fields to zero by short-
circuiting  the  normal  electrons  until  the  maximum  current  carrying  capacity  of  those  pairs  is 
exceeded.  If  the  applied  fields  have  frequency  f  >  0,  then  the  Cooper  pairs  behave  much  like 
collisionless  electrons  in  a  plasma  and  therefore  the  applied  electric  field  can  penetrate  that 
plasma  to  its  skin  depth,  as  discussed  in  Section  9.8.    Those  penetrating  electric  fields  interact 

- 43 -


with  a  small number of normal  electrons  to produce  tiny  losses  in  superconductors  that  increase 
with frequency. 

2.5.3 

Permittivity 

The  permittivity  εo  of  free  space  is  8.854×10-12  farads/meter, where⎯D  =  εo E .  The  permittivity 
ε of  any material deviates  from εo  for  free  space  if  applied  electric  fields  induce  electric dipoles 
in  the medium;  such  dipoles  alter  the  applied  electric  field  seen  by  neighboring  atoms.   Electric 
fields  generally  distort  atoms  because  E   pulls  on  positively  charged  nuclei  ( f
qE   [N])  and 
=
repels  the  surrounding negatively  charged  electron  clouds.   The  resulting  small offset  d  of  each 
atomic nucleus of charge +q relative to the center of its associated electron cloud produces a tiny 
electric  dipole  in  each  atom,  as  suggested  in  Figure  2.5.1(a).    In  addition,  most  asymmetric 
molecules  are permanently polarized,  such  as H2O or NH3,  and  can  rotate within  fluids or gases 
to  align with  an  applied  field.   Whether  the  dipole moments  are  induced,  or  permanent  and  free 
to  rotate,  the  result  is  a  complete  or  partial  alignment  of  dipole moments  as  suggested  in  Figure 
2.5.1(b). 

These  polarization  charges  generally  cancel  inside  the  medium,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
2.5.1(b),  but  the  immobile  atomic  dipoles  on  the  outside  surfaces  of  the  medium  are  not  fully 
cancelled and therefore contribute the surface polarization charge ρsp.

Figure 2.5.1  Polarized media. 
 

Figure  2.5.1(c)  suggests  how  two  charged  plates  might  provide  an  electric  field  E   that  
polarizes a dielectric slab having permittivity ε > εo.  [The electric field  E  is the same in vacuum 

- 44 -


as  it  is  inside  the dielectric (assuming no air gaps) because  the path  integral of  E ds   from plate 
•
to  plate  equals  their  voltage  difference  V  in  both  cases.    The  electric  displacement  vector 
De  = εE   and  therefore  differs.]  We  associate  the  difference  between  Do  = εo E   (vacuum)  and 
Dε  = εE  (dielectric) with the electric polarization vector  P , where: 

(  + χ ) 
E = εo E + P = ε o 
D = ε 
E 1 

(2.5.8)

The  polarization  vector  P   is  defined  by  (2.5.8)  and  is  normally  parallel  to  E   in  the  same 
direction,  as  shown  in  Figure  2.5.1(c);  it  points  from  the  negative  surface  polarization  charge  to 
the  positive  surface  polarization  charge  (unlike  E ,  which  points  from  positive  charges  to 
negative  ones).  As  suggested  in  (2.5.8),  P Eε χ ,  where  χ  is  defined  as  the  dimensionless 
= 
o 
susceptibility of the dielectric.  Because nuclei are bound rather tightly to their electron clouds, χ 
is  generally  less  than  3  for  most  atoms,  although  some  molecules  and  crystals,  particularly  in 
fluid form, can exhibit much higher values.  It is shown later in (2.5.13) that  P  simply equals the 
product  of  the  number  density  n  of  these  dipoles  and  the  average  vector  electric  dipole moment 
of  each  atom  or molecule,  p qd , where  d   is  the  offset  (meters)  of  the  positive  charge  relative 
= 
to the negative charge:

 ⎡⎣C m

(2.5.9)

Gauss’s  law  relates  D   to  charge  density  ρ  [C m-2],  but we  now  have  two  types  of  density: 
that of  free charges ρf,  including  ions and surface charges on conductors, and  that of any  locally 
un-neutralized  polarization  charge ρp  bound within  charge-neutral  atoms  or molecules.   Gauss’s 
law says: 

∇ • D = ρ f 

where ρf is the free charge density [C m-3]. 

(2.5.10) 

We can derive a relation similar  to (2.5.10) for  P  by treating materials as distributed bound 
positive  and  negative  charges  with  vacuum  between  them;  the  net  bound  charge  density  is 
designated the polarization charge density  ρp [C m-3].  Then in the vacuum between the charges 
D = εo E  and (2.5.10) becomes: 

ε ∇ • E = ρ  + ρ 
o 
f
p 

(2.5.11)

From ∇ • (2.5.8), we obtain  ∇ • D = ε  ∇ • E + ∇ • P = ρ  .  Combining this with (2.5.11) yields: 
o

∇ • P = −ρ p 

(2.5.12) 

- 45 -


The  negative  sign  in  (2.5.12)  is  consistent  with  the  fact  that  P ,  unlike  E ,  is  directed  from 
negative to positive polarization charge, as noted earlier. 

Outside  a  polarized  dielectric  the  polarization  P   is  zero,  as  suggested  by  Figure  2.5.1(d). 
Note  that  the  net  polarization  charge  density  is  ±nq  for  only  an  atomic-scale  distance  d  at  the 
boundaries  of  the  dielectric,  where  we  model  the  positive  and  negative  charge  distributions 
within  the  medium  as  continuous  uniform  rectilinear  slabs  of  density  ±  nq  [C  m-3].  These  two 
slabs  are  offset  by  the  distance  d.    If  P   is  in  the  z  direction  and  arises  from  n  dipole  moments 
p qd  per  cubic meter, where  d   is  the offset  [m] of  the positive  charge  relative  to  the negative 
=
charge, then (2.5.12) can be integrated over a volume V that encloses a unit area of the left-hand 
face  of  a  polarized  dielectric  [see  Figure  2.5.1(d)]  to  yield  the  polarization  vector  P   inside  the  
dielectric: 

∇ • P dv = − ∫V 
P = ∫V 
ρp  dv = nqd 

(2.5.13) 

The  first  equality  of  (2.5.13)  involving⎯P  follows  from Gauss’s  divergence  theorem:  ∫V∇ • P dv 
= ∫A P z•  ˆ da = Pz if A = 1.  Therefore,  P = nqd  , proving (2.5.9). 

When the electric displacement⎯D varies with time it becomes displacement current, ∂ D /∂t 
[A/m2],  analogous  to⎯J,  as  suggested  by  Ampere's  law:    ∇  ×⎯H  =⎯J  +  ∂ D /∂t.   For  reference,

Most  dielectric  materials  are  lossy  because  oscillatory  electric  fields  dither  the  directions 
and  magnitudes  of  the  induced  electric  dipoles,  and  some  of  this  motion  heats  the  dielectric. 
This  effect  can  be  represented  by  a  frequency-dependent  complex  permittivity  ε ,  as  discussed 
further  in  Section  9.5.    Some  dielectrics  have  direction-dependent  permittivities  that  can  be 
represented  by  ε ;  such  anisotropic  materials  are  discussed  in  Section  9.6.    Lossy  anisotropic 
materials can be characterized by  ε . 

Some  special  dielectric  media  are  spontaneously  polarized,  even  in  the  absence  of  an 
externally applied  E .  This occurs for highly polarizable media where orientation of one electric 
dipole  in  the  media  can  motivate  its  neighbors  to  orient  themselves  similarly,  forming  domains 

- 46 -


of  atoms,  molecules,  or  crystal  unit  cells  that  are  all  polarized  the  same.    Such  spontaneously 
polarized  domains  are  illustrated  for  magnetic  materials  in  Figure  2.5.2.    As  in  the  case  of 
ferromagnetic domains,  in  the absence of externally applied  fields, domain size  is  limited by  the 
buildup  of  stored  field  energy  external  to  the  domain;  adjacent  domains  are  oriented  so  as  to 
largely cancel each other.  Such  ferroelectric materials have  large effective values of ε, although 
D   saturates  if  E   is  sufficient  to  produce  ~100%  alignment  of  polarization.  They  can  also 
exhibit hysteresis as do the ferromagnetic materials discussed in Section 2.5.4.

Permeability 

The  permeability  μo  of  free  space  is  4π10-7  Henries/meter  by  definition,  where⎯B  =  μ H .  The 
permeability  μ  of  matter  includes  the  additional  contributions  to  B   from  atomic  magnetic 
dipoles  aligning  with  the  applied  H .    These  magnetic  dipoles  and  their  associated  magnetic 
fields arise either from electrons orbiting about atomic nuclei or from spinning charged particles, 
where such moving charge is current.  All electrons and protons have spin ±1/2 in addition to any 
orbital  spin  about  the  nucleus,  and  the  net  spin  of  an  atom  or  nucleus  can  be  non-zero.    Their 
magnetic  fields  are  linked  to  their  equivalent  currents  by  Ampere’s  law,  ∇ × H J + ∂ 
D ∂t . 
= 
Quantum  theory describes how  these magnetic moments are quantized at discrete  levels, and  for 
some devices quantum descriptions are necessary.  In this text we average over large numbers of 
atoms, so that  B = μH  accurately characterizes media, and quantum effects can be ignored. 

In  any  medium  the  cumulative  contribution  of  induced  magnetic  dipoles  to  B   is  
characterized by the magnetization  M , which is defined by: 

B = μH = μ  ( H + M ) = μ  H 1 + χ 
( 
m )

(2.5.14)

where  χm  is  the  magnetic  susceptibility  of  the  medium.    Because  of  quantum  effects  χm  for 
diamagnetic  materials  is  slightly  negative  so  that  μ  <  μo;  examples  include  silver,  copper,  and 
water, as  listed  in Table 2.5.3.  The  table also  lists  representative paramagnetic materials, which 
have  slightly  positive  magnetic  susceptibilities,  and  ferromagnetic  materials,  which  have  very 
large susceptibilities (e.g., cobalt, etc.).

The  sharp  difference  between  normal  materials  with  μ ≅ μo  and  ferromagnetic  materials 
having  μ  >>  μo  is  due  to  the  spontaneous  alignment  of  atomic  magnetic  dipoles  in  the  same 
direction  so  as  to  increase  the  applied  field,  reorienting  the  remaining  dipoles.    That  is,  if  the 
susceptibility  of  a  material  is  above  some  threshold,  then  the  atomic  magnetic  dipoles 
spontaneously  align  over  regions  of  size  limited  by  grain  structure  or  energy  considerations,  as 
suggested  in  Figure  2.5.2(a  and  b).    These  regions  of  nearly  perfect  alignment  are  called 
magnetic  domains.  These  domains  are  normally  quite  small  (perhaps  micron-size)  so  as  to 
minimize  the  stored magnetic  energy μH2.  In  this  regime,  if  only  energy  considerations  control 
domain  size,  then  the  sizes  of  those  domains  oriented  in  the  general  direction  of  the  applied 
magnetic  field  grow  as  that  field  increases,  while  other  domains  shrink,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
2.5.2(c).  Since domain walls cannot easily move across grain walls, the granular structure of the 
material  can  be  engineered  to  control  magnetic  properties.    If  domain  walls  move  easily,  the 
magnetic susceptability χm is large.

At  sufficiently  high  magnetic  fields  all  domains  will  expand  to  their  maximum  size  and/or 
rotate  in  the  direction  of  H .    This  corresponds  to  the  maximum  value  of  M   and  magnetic 
saturation.  The  resulting  typical  non-linear  behavior  of  the magnetization  curve  relating  B  and 
H  for  ferromagnetic materials  is  suggested  in Figure 2.5.3(a).   The  slope of  the B vs. H curve  is

when  doing  so,  the  hysteresis  curve  of  Figure  2.5.3(b)  results.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  area 
enclosed by the figure is the energy dissipated per cycle as the applied  H  oscillates.

Hard magnetic materials have large values of residual flux density Br and magnetic coercive 
force  or  coercivity  Hc,  as  illustrated.    Br  corresponds  to  the  magnetic  strength  B  of  this

If we represent the magnetic dipole moment of an atom by m, where  m  for a current loop of 
magnitude I and area  nˆA  is  nˆIA  [A m]7, then it can be shown that the total magnetization  M  of  
-1]  via  the  same  approach  used  to  derive  P n p (2.5.13)  for  the 
a  medium  is  n m   [A  m

Example 2.5B 
Show how  the power dissipated  in a hysteretic magnetic material  is  related  to  the area circled  in 
Figure 2.5.3(b) as H oscillates.  For simplicity, approximate  the  loop  in  the  figure by a  rectangle 
bounded by ±Ho and ±Bo. 

Solution:  	 We  seek  the  energy  dissipated  in  the material  by  one  traverse  of  this  loop  as H  goes 
from +Ho  to  -Ho and back  to +Ho.  The energy density Wm = BH/2 when B = 0 at  t = 
0  is  Wm  =  0;  Wm→BoHo/2  [J  m-3]  as  B→Bo.  As  H  returns  to  0  while  B  =  Bo,  this 
energy  is  dissipated  and  cannot  be  recovered  by  an  external  circuit  because  any 
voltage  induced  in  that circuit would be ∝ ∂B/∂t = 0.   As H→-Ho, Wm→BoHo/2;  this 
energy  can  be  recovered  by  an  external  circuit  later  as  B→0  because  ∂B/∂t  ≠  0.    As  
B→-Bo, Wm→BoHo/2, which  is  lost  later as H→0 with ∂B/∂t = 0.  The energy stored 

7 nˆ  is the unit vector normal to the tiny area A enclosed by the current I, using the right-hand-rule. 

- 49 -


as H→Ho with B = -Bo is again recoverable as B→0 with H = Ho.  Thus the minimum 
energy  dissipated  during  one  loop  traverse  is  vBoHo[J],  where  v  is  material  volume. 
If  the  drive  circuits  do  not  recapture  the  available  energy  but  dissipate  it,  the  total 
energy dissipated per cycle is doubled.

Boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields 

2.6.1 

Introduction 

Maxwell’s  equations  characterize  macroscopic  matter  by  means  of  its  permittivity  ε, 
permeability μ, and conductivity σ, where these properties are usually represented by scalars and 
can  vary  among  media.    Section  2.5  discussed  media  for  which  ε,  μ,  and  σ  are  represented  by 
matrices,  complex  quantities,  or  other  means.    This  Section  2.6  discusses  how  Maxwell’s 
equations  strongly  constrain  the  behavior  of  electromagnetic  fields  at  boundaries  between  two 
media  having  different  properties,  where  these  constraint  equations  are  called  boundary 
conditions.  Section  2.6.2  discusses  the  boundary  conditions  governing  field  components 
perpendicular  to  the  boundary,  and Section  2.6.3  discusses  the  conditions  governing  the  parallel 
field  components.    Section  2.6.4  then  treats  the  special  case  of  fields  adjacent  to  perfect 
conductors. 

One  result  of  these  boundary  conditions  is  that  waves  at  boundaries  are  generally  partially 
transmitted  and  partially  reflected with  directions  and  amplitudes  that  depend  on  the  two media 
and  the  incident  angles  and  polarizations.    Static  fields  also  generally  have  different  amplitudes 
and  directions  on  the  two  sides  of  a  boundary.    Some  boundaries  in  both  static  and  dynamic 
situations  also  possess  surface  charge  or  carry  surface  currents  that  further  affect  the  adjacent 
fields. 

2.6.2  Boundary conditions for perpendicular field components 

The boundary conditions governing  the perpendicular components of  E  and  H   follow  from  the 
integral forms of Gauss’s laws:

We  may  integrate  these  equations  over  the  surface  S  and  volume  V  of  the  thin  infinitesimal 
pillbox  illustrated  in  Figure  2.6.1.    The  pillbox  is  parallel  to  the  surface  and  straddles  it,  half 
being  on  each  side  of  the  boundary.  The  thickness  δ  of  the  pillbox  approaches  zero  faster  than 
does its surface area S, where S is approximately twice the area A of the top surface of the box.

Beginning  with  the  boundary  condition  for  the  perpendicular  component  D⊥,  we  integrate 
Gauss’s law (2.6.1) over the pillbox to obtain: 
(cid:119)∫∫S ( D • nˆa ) da
≅ ( D1⊥ − D2⊥ ) A = ∫∫∫V 
 
ρ  dv
where  ρs  is  the  surface  charge  density  [Coulombs  m-2].  The  subscript  s  for  surface  charge  ρs 
distinguishes  it from  the volume charge density ρ [C m-3]. The pillbox is so thin (δ → 0)  that: 1) 
the  contribution  to  the  surface  integral  of  the  sides  of  the  pillbox  vanishes  in  comparison  to  the 
rest  of  the  integral,  and  2)  only  a  surface  charge  q  can  be  contained within  it, where ρs  =  q/A  = 
lim ρδ as the charge density ρ → ∞ and δ → 0.  Thus (2.6.3) becomes D1⊥ - D2⊥ = ρs, which can 
be written as: 

 
= ρ sA 

(2.6.3) 

nˆ • ( D1 − D2 ) = ρ s 

(boundary condition for  D⊥ ) 

(2.6.4) 

where  nˆ   is  the  unit  vector  normal  to  the  boundary  and  points  into  medium  1.    Thus  the 
perpendicular  component  of  the  electric  displacement  vector  D   changes  value  at  a  boundary  in 
accord with the surface charge density ρs. 

Because Gauss’s  laws are  the same  for electric and magnetic  fields, except  that  there are no 
magnetic  charges,  the  same  analysis  for  the magnetic  flux  density  B   in  (2.6.2)  yields  a  similar 
boundary condition: 

nˆ • ( B1 − B2 ) = 0 

(boundary condition for  B⊥ ) 

(2.6.5) 

Thus the perpendicular component of  B  must be continuous across any boundary.

2.6.3  Boundary conditions for parallel field components 

The boundary conditions governing  the parallel components of  E  and  H  follow from Faraday’s

We  can  integrate  these  equations  around  the  elongated  rectangular  contour  C  that  straddles  the 
boundary and has infinitesimal area A, as  illustrated  in Figure 2.6.2.   We assume  the  total height 
δ of the rectangle is much less than its length W, and circle C in a right-hand sense relative to the

where  the  integral  of  B   over  area A  approaches  zero  in  the  limit where  δ  approaches  zero  too; 
there can be no  impulses  in  B .  Since W ≠ 0,  it  follows  from  (2.6.8)  that E1//  - E2// = 0, or more 
generally: 

B • nˆa da  → 0 

nˆ × ( E1 − E 2 ) = 0 

(boundary condition for  E // ) 

(2.6.9) 

Thus the parallel component of  E  must be continuous across any boundary. 

A  similar  integration  of  Ampere’s  law,  (2.6.7),  under  the  assumption  that  the  contour  C  is 
chosen  to  lie  in a plane perpendicular  to  the surface current  Js  and  is  traversed  in  the right-hand 
sense, yields:

where we note that the area integral of  ∂D t∂  approaches zero as δ → 0, but not the integral over 
the  surface  current  Js , which  occupies  a  surface  layer  thin  compared  to  δ.  Thus  H1 //  − H2 //   = 
Js , or more generally: 

nˆ × ( H1 − H 2 ) = Js 

(boundary condition for  H // ) 

(2.6.11) 

where  nˆ   is  defined  as  pointing  from  medium  2  into  medium  1.    If  the  medium  is  non­
conducting,⎯Js = 0. 

A  simple  static  example  illustrates  how  these  boundary  conditions  generally  result  in  fields 
on two sides of a boundary pointing in different directions.  Consider the magnetic fields  H1  and 
H2   illustrated  in  Figure  2.6.3,  where  μ2  ≠ μ1,  and  both  media  are  insulators  so  the  surface 
current must  be  zero.    If we  are  given  H1 ,  then  the magnitude  and  angle  of  H2   are  determined 
because  H //   and  B⊥   are  continuous  across  the  boundary, where  Bi  = μi Hi .  More  specifically, 
H2 //  = H1 //  , and:

Thus  θ2  approaches  90  degrees  when  μ2  >>  μ1,  almost  regardless  of  θ1,  so  the  magnetic  flux 
inside  high  permeability  materials  is  nearly  parallel  to  the  walls  and  trapped  inside,  even  when 
the  field  orientation  outside  the  medium  is  nearly  perpendicular  to  the  interface.    The  flux 
escapes high-μ material best when θ1  ≅ 90°.  This phenomenon is critical to the design of motors 
or other systems incorporating iron or nickel. 

If  a  static  surface  current  Js   flows  at  the  boundary,  then  the  relations  between  B1   and  B2 
are altered along with  those  for  H1  and  H2 .  Similar considerations and methods apply  to static 
electric  fields  at  a  boundary,  where  any  static  surface  charge  on  the  boundary  alters  the 
relationship  between  D1   and  D2 .  Surface  currents  normally  arise  only  in  non-static  or 
“dynamic” cases. 

Example 2.6A 
Two  insulating  planar  dielectric  slabs  having  ε1  and  ε2  are  bonded  together.  Slab  1  has  E1   at 
angle  θ1  to  the  surface  normal.    What  are  E 2   and  θ2  if  we  assume  the  surface  charge  at  the 
 
boundary ρs = 0?  What are the components of  E 2  if ρs  ≠ 0?

2.6.4  Boundary conditions adjacent to perfect conductors 

The  four  boundary  conditions  (2.6.4),  (2.6.5),  (2.6.9),  and  (2.6.11)  are  simplified  when  one 
medium  is  a  perfect  conductor  (σ = ∞)  because  electric  and magnetic  fields must  be  zero  inside 
it.  The  electric  field  is  zero  because  otherwise  it  would  produce  enormous  J = σE   so  as  to  
redistribute  the  charges  and  to  neutralize  that  E   almost  instantly,  with  a  time  constant  τ = ε σ 
seconds, as shown in Equation (4.3.3). 

It  can  also  be  easily  shown  that  B   is  zero  inside  perfect  conductors.    Faraday’s  law  says 
E = − B  t 
∂ ∂ ,  so  if 
E 0 ,  then  ∂  ∂ = 0 . 
B t 
If  the  perfect  conductor  were  created  in  the 
∇ × 
= 
absence of  B   then  B  would always  remain zero  inside.    It has  further been observed  that when 
certain  special  materials  become  superconducting  at  low  temperatures,  as  discussed  in  Section 
2.5.2, any pre-existing⎯B is thrust outside. 

The  boundary  conditions  for  perfect  conductors  are  also  relevant  for  normal  conductors 
because  most  metals  have  sufficient  conductivity  σ  to  enable  J   and  ρs  to  cancel  the  incident 
electric  field,  although  not  instantly.    As  discussed  in  Section  4.3.1,  this  relaxation  process  by 
which  charges  move  to  cancel  E   is  sufficiently  fast  for  most  metallic  conductors  that  they 

- 54 -


largely  obey  the  perfect-conductor  boundary  conditions  for  most  wavelengths  of  interest,  from 
DC  to  beyond  the  infrared  region.  This  relaxation  time  constant  is  τ  =  ε/σ  seconds.  One 
consequence  of  finite  conductivity  is  that  any  surface  current  penetrates  metals  to  some  depth 
2
ωμσ , called  the skin depth, as discussed  in Section 9.2.   At sufficiently  low frequencies, 
δ = 
even  sea  water  with  its  limited  conductivity  largely  obeys  the  perfect-conductor  boundary 
condition. 

The  four  boundary  conditions  for  fields  adjacent  to  perfect  conductors  are  presented  below 
together  with  the  more  general  boundary  condition  from  which  they  follow  when  all  fields  in 
medium 2 are zero:

(2.6.17) 

These  four  boundary  conditions  state  that  magnetic  fields  can  only  be  parallel  to  perfect 
conductors,  while  electric  fields  can  only  be  perpendicular.    Moreover,  the  magnetic  fields  are 
always associated with surface currents flowing  in an orthogonal direction;  these currents have a 
numerical  value  equal  to  H .    The  perpendicular  electric  fields  are  always  associated  with  a 
surface  charge  ρs  numerically  equal  to  D ;  the  sign  of  σ  is  positive  when  D   points  away  from 
the conductor.

Since  E //  and  D⊥  are continuous  (let’s assume ρs = 0  if  J
0 ), static  E  and  D  are  
=

unconstrained  at  the  boundary  while  dynamic  E D = 0

  there  because  there  is  no

dynamic  electric  field  inside  and  no  dynamic  surface  charge.    Since  only  H⊥ ≠ 0  at 
the  boundary,  this  is  non-physical  and  such media  don’t  exist.   For  example,  there  is 
no  way  to  match  boundary  conditions  for  an  incoming  plane  wave.    This  impasse 
would be avoided if σ ≠ 0, for then dynamic  H //  and  E⊥  could be non-zero.

Power and energy in the time and frequency domains, Poynting theorem 

2.7.1 

Poynting theorem and definition of power and energy in the time domain 

To derive  the Poynting  theorem we  can manipulate Maxwell’s  equations  to produce products of 
variables  that  have  the  dimensions  and  character  of  power  or  energy.    For  example,  the  power 
dissipated  in  a  resistor  is  the  product  of  its  voltage  and  current,  so  the  product  E J   [W  m-3]
•
would  be  of  interest.  The  dimensions  of  E   and  J   are  volts  per  meter  and  amperes  per  square 
meter, respectively.  Faraday’s and Ampere’s laws are:

2.7.2  Complex Poynting theorem and definition of complex power and energy 

Unfortunately  we  cannot  blindly  apply  to  power  and  energy  our  standard  conversion  protocol 
between  frequency-domain  and  time-domain  representations  because  we  no  longer  have  only  a 
single  frequency  present.  Time-harmonic  power  and  energy  involve  the  products  of  sinusoids 
and  therefore  exhibit  sum  and  difference  frequencies.    More  explicitly,  we  cannot  simply 
{
tω }
Re S e j
represent  the  Poynting  vector  S( t ) for  a  field  at  frequency  f  [Hz]  by 
  because  power 
has  components  at  both  f  =  0  and  2f  Hz,  where  ω =  2πf.  Nonetheless  we  can  use  the 
convenience of the time-harmonic notation by restricting it to fields, voltages, and currents while 
representing their products, i.e. power and energy, only by their complex averages. 

To  understand  the  definitions  of  complex  power  and  energy,  consider  the  product  of  two 
sinusoids, a(t) and b(t), where: 
R e {Ae  ω } = R e Ae   e j  } = A  cos

Note  that  S   is  complex  and  can  be  purely  imaginary.    Its  average  power  density  is  given  by 
(2.7.17). 

We  can  re-derive  Poynting’s  theorem  to  infer  the  physical  significance  of  this  complex

(2.7.20) 

To see how time-average dissipated power,  E J ∗  2  is related to other terms, we compute the dot 
•
product  of  E   and  the  complex  conjugate  of Ampere’s  law,  and  subtract  it  from  the  dot  product 
of  H ∗  and Faraday’s law to yield:

2.8  Uniqueness theorem 

Throughout  this  text we  often  implicitly  assume  uniqueness when we  first  guess  the  solution  to 
Maxwell’s  equations  for  a  given  set  of  boundary  conditions  and  then  test  that  solution  against 
those equations.  This process does not guarantee  that  the  resulting  solution  is unique, and often 
there  are  an  infinite  number  of  possible  solutions,  of  which  we  might  guess  only  one.    The 

- 62 -

uniqueness  theorem  is  quite  useful  for  it  sets  forth  constraints  on  the  boundary  conditions  that 
guarantee there is only one solution to Maxwell’s equations, which we can find as usual. 

To prove  the uniqueness  theorem we begin by  considering  a volume V  enclosed by  surface 
S and governed by Maxwell’s equations: 

∇ • Di  = ρ	

∇ • Bi  = 0 

∇ × Ei  = − ∂Bi 
∂t	

∇ × Hi  = J + ∂Di	
∂t 

(2.8.1) 

(2.8.2)

where i = 1, 2 correspond to two possible solutions consistent with the given source distributions 
ρ and  J .  We can now show that the difference  Ad  = A1 − A2  between these two solutions must 
be  zero  under  certain  conditions,  and  therefore  there  can  then  be  no more  than  one  solution:  A 
represents  D,  B,   E,  H,  or  J . 

If we subtract (2.8.1) for i = 2 from (2.8.1) for i = 1 we obtain: 

∇ • ( D1 − D 2 ) = ∇ • Dd  = 0	

(2.8.3) 

Similar  subtraction of corresponding equations  for  (2.8.2) yield  three more Maxwell’s equations 
that the difference fields  Bd  and  Dd  must satisfy: 

∇ • Bd  = 0 

∇ × Ed  = − ∂Bd 
∂t 

∇ × Hd  =

∂Dd	
∂t 

(2.8.4)

where we note that the source terms ρ and  J  have vanished from (2.8.3) and (2.8.4) because they 
are given and fixed. 

The boundary constraints that ensure uniqueness are: 

(1)  	At  some  time  t  =  0  the  fields  are  known  everywhere  so  that  at  that  instant 
Ed  = Dd  = Hd  = Bd  = 0 . 

(2)  	 At all  times and at each point on  the  surface S either  the  tangential  E  or  the  tangential 
H  is known. 

Applying Poynting’s theorem (2.7.10) to the difference fields at time t proves uniqueness subject 
to these constraints:

(2.8.5) 

- 63 -


Boundary constraint (2) ensures that the tangential component of either  Ed  or  Hd  is always 
zero,  thus  forcing  the  cross  product  in  the  second  integral  of  (2.8.5)  to  zero  everywhere  on  the 
enclosing  surface  S.    The  first  integral  can  be  simplified  if  D = εE  and  B = μH ,  where  both  ε 
and  μ  can  be  functions  of  position.    Because  this  volume  integral  then  involves  only  the  time 
2 ) ,  and  because  these  fields  are 
derivative  of  the  squares  of  the  difference  fields  ( 
2 
and   Ed
Hd 
zero  at  t  =  0  by  virtue  of  constraint  (1),  the  difference  fields  can  never  depart  from  zero  while 
satisfying (2.8.5).   Since (2.8.5) holds for all  time, the difference fields must  therefore always be 
zero  everywhere,  meaning  there  can  be  no  more  than  one  solution  to  Maxwell’s  equations 
subject to the two constraints listed above.

Chapter 3:  Electromagnetic Fields in Simple Devices and Circuits 

3.1 

Resistors and capacitors 

3.1.1 

Introduction 

One  important  application  of  electromagnetic  field  analysis  is  to  simple  electronic  components 
such  as  resistors,  capacitors,  and  inductors,  all  of  which  exhibit  at  higher  frequencies 
characteristics of the others.  Such structures can be analyzed in terms of their: 1) static behavior, 
for which we  can  set  ∂/∂t  =  0  in Maxwell’s  equations,  2)  quasistatic  behavior,  for which  ∂/∂t  is 
non-negligible,  but  we  neglect  terms  of  the  order  ∂2/∂t2,  and  3)  dynamic  behavior,  for  which 
terms  on  the  order  of  ∂2/∂t2  are  not  negligible  either;  in  the  dynamic  case  the  wavelengths  of 
interest are no longer large compared to the device dimensions.  Because most such devices have 
either  cylindrical  or  planar  geometries,  as  discussed  in  Sections  1.3  and  1.4,  their  fields  and 
behavior  are  generally  easily  understood.    This  understanding  can  be  extrapolated  to  more 
complex structures. 

One  approach  to  analyzing  simple  structures  is  to  review  the  basic  constraints  imposed  by 
symmetry,  Maxwell’s  equations,  and  boundary  conditions,  and  then  to  hypothesize  the  electric 
and magnetic  fields  that would  result.   These hypotheses can  then be  tested  for consistency with 
any  remaining  constraints  not  already  invoked.    To  illustrate  this  approach  resistors,  capacitors, 
and inductors with simple shapes are analyzed in Sections 3.1–2 below. 

All  physical  elements  exhibit  varying  degrees  of  resistance,  inductance,  and  capacitance, 
depending  on  frequency.  This  is  because:  1)  essentially  all  conducting  materials  exhibit  some 
resistance, 2) all currents generate magnetic fields and therefore contribute inductance, and 3) all 
voltage  differences  generate  electric  fields  and  therefore  contribute  capacitance.    R’s,  L’s,  and 
C’s are designed to exhibit only one dominant property at low frequencies.  Section 3.3 discusses 
simple examples of ambivalent device behavior as frequency changes. 

Most  passive  electronic  components  have  two  or  more  terminals  where  voltages  can  be 
measured.    The  voltage  difference  between  any  two  terminals  of  a  passive  device  generally 
depends  on  the  histories  of  the  currents  through  all  the  terminals.   Common  passive  linear  two-
terminal  devices  include  resistors,  inductors,  and  capacitors  (R’s,  L’s.  and  C’s,  respectively), 
while  transformers  are  commonly  three-  or  four-terminal  devices.    Devices  with  even  more 
terminals  are  often  simply  characterized  as  N-port  networks.    Connected  sets  of  such  passive 
linear devices form passive  linear circuits which can be analyzed using  the methods discussed  in 
Section  3.4.   RLC  resonators  and RL  and RC  relaxation  circuits  are most  relevant  here  because 
their physics and behavior resemble those of common electromagnetic systems.  RLC resonators 
are  treated  in Section 3.5,  and RL, RC,  and LC  circuits  are  limiting  cases when one of  the  three 
elements becomes negligible. 

3.1.2  Resistors 

Resistors are two-terminal passive linear devices characterized by their resistance R [ohms]: 

- 65 -


v = iR 

(3.1.1) 

where  v(t)  and  i(t)  are  the  associated  voltage  and  current.    That  is,  one  volt  across  a  one-ohm 
resistor induces a one-ampere current through it; this defines the ohm. 

The resistor illustrated in Figure 3.1.1 is comprised of two parallel perfectly conducting end-
plates  between which  is  placed  a medium  of  conductivity  σ,  permittivity  ε,  permeability  μ,  and 
thickness d; the two end plates and the medium all have a constant cross-sectional area A [m2] in 
the  x-y  plane.  Let’s  assume  a  static  voltage  v  exists  across  the  resistor  R,  and  that  a  current  i 
flows through it.

Boundary  conditions  require  the  electric  field  E   at  any  perfectly  conducting  plate  to  be 
perpendicular  to  it  [see  (2.6.16);  E × = 0 ],  and  Faraday’s  law  requires  that  any  line  integral  of 
nˆ
E  from one iso-potential end plate to the other must equal the voltage v regardless of the path of 
integration (1.3.13).   Because  the conductivity σ [Siemens/m]  is uniform within walls parallel  to 
zˆ , these constraints are satisfied by a static uniform electric field  E =  zˆE o  everywhere within the 
conducting medium, which would be charge-free since our assumed  E  is non-divergent.  Thus:

Such an electric field within the conducting medium induces a current density  J , where:

The total current i flowing is the integral of  J • zˆ  over the device cross-section A, so that:

But i = v/R from (3.1.1), and therefore the static resistance of a simple planar resistor is: 

R v i

(3.1.5)

The  instantaneous  power  p  [W]  dissipated  in  a  resistor  is  i2R  =  v2/R,  and  the  time-average 
2

power  dissipated  in  the  sinusoidal  steady  state  is  I R 2  = V  2 R    watts.    Alternatively  the

(3.1.6) 

which is the expected answer, and where we used (2.1.17):  J = σE . 

Surface  charges  reside  on  the  end  plates  where  the  electric  field  is  perpendicular  to  the 
perfect  conductor.    The  boundary  condition  nˆ • D = ρs   (2.6.15)  suggests  that  the  surface  charge 
density ρs on the positive end-plate face adjacent to the conducting medium is: 

o ⎡⎣ 
E   Cm
ρ = ε 
s 

-2 ⎤⎦ 

(3.1.7) 

The  total  static  charge  Q  on  the  positive  resistor  end  plate  is  therefore  ρsA  coulombs.    By 
convention,  the  subscript  s  distinguishes  surface  charge  density  ρs  [C  m-2]  from  volume  charge 
density  ρ  [C  m-3].  An  equal  negative  surface  charge  resides  on  the  other  end-plate.    The  total 
stored charged Q = ρsA = CV, where C is the device capacitance, as discussed further in Section 
3.1.3. 

The  static  currents  and  voltages  in  this  resistor  will  produce  fields  outside  the  resistor,  but 
these  produce  no  additional  current  or  voltage  at  the  device  terminals  and  are  not  of  immediate 
concern  here.  Similarly,  μ  and  ε  do  not  affect  the  static  value  of  R.   At  higher  frequencies, 
however,  this  resistance  R  varies  and  both  inductance  and  capacitance  appear,  as  shown  in  the 
following  three  sections.  Although  this  static  solution  for  charge,  current,  and  electric  field 
within  the  conducting  portion  of  the  resistor  satisfies Maxwell’s  equations,  a  complete  solution 
would  also  prove  uniqueness  and  consistency  with  H   and  Maxwell’s  equations  outside  the 
device.  Uniqueness  is  addressed  by  the  uniqueness  theorem  in  Section  2.8,  and  approaches  to 
finding fields for arbitrary device geometries are discussed briefly in Sections 4.4–6. 

- 67 -


Example 3.1A 
Design  a  practical  100-ohm  resistor.    If  thermal  dissipation  were  a  problem,  how  might  that 
change the design? 

Solution:	 Resistance  R  =  d/σA  (3.1.5),  and  if  we  arbitrarily  choose  a  classic  cylindrical  shape 
with  resistor  length  d  =  4r,  where  r  is  the  radius,  then  A  =  πr2  =  πd2/16  and 
R  =  16/πdσ =  100.  Discrete  resistors  are  smaller  for  modern  low  power  compact 
circuits,  so  we  might  set  d  =  1  mm,  yielding  σ =  16/πdR  =  16/(π10-3×100)  ≅ 
51 S m-1.  Such conductivities roughly correspond, for example, to very salty water or 
carbon  powder.  The  surface  area  of  the  resistor  must  be  sufficient  to  dissipate  the 
maximum  power  expected,  however.    Flat  resistors  thermally  bonded  to  a  heat  sink 
can be smaller than air-cooled devices, and these are often made of thin metallic film. 
Some resistors are long wires wound in coils.  Resistor failure often occurs where the 
local  resistance  is  slightly  higher,  and  the  resulting  heat  typically  increases  the  local 
resistance further, causing even more local heating. 

3.1.3  Capacitors 

Capacitors  are  two-terminal  passive  linear  devices  storing  charge  Q  and  characterized  by  their 
capacitance C [Farads], defined by: 

Q = Cv  [Coulombs]	

(3.1.8) 

where  v(t)  is  the  voltage  across  the  capacitor.    That  is,  one  static  volt  across  a  one-Farad 
capacitor  stores  one  Coulomb  on  each  terminal,  as  discussed  further  below;  this  defines  the 
Farad [Coulombs per volt]. 

The  resistive  structure  illustrated  in  Figure  3.1.1  becomes  a  pure  capacitor  at  low 
frequencies if the media conductivity σ → 0.  Although some capacitors are air-filled with ε ≅ εo, 
usually dielectric  filler with permittivity ε > εo  is used. Typical values for  the dielectric constant 
ε/εo  used  in  capacitors  are  ~1-100.    In  all  cases  boundary  conditions  again  require  that  the 
electric  field  E   be  perpendicular  to  the  perfectly  conducting  end  plates,  i.e.,  to  be  in  the  ±z 
direction, and Faraday’s law requires that any line integral of  E  from one iso-potential end plate 
to  the  other must  equal  the  voltage  v  across  the  capacitor.    These  constraints  are  again  satisfied 
by  a  static  uniform  electric  field  E = zˆE o   within  the  medium  separating  the  plates,  which  is 
uniform and charge-free. 

We  shall  neglect  temporarily  the  effects  of  all  fields  produced  outside  the  capacitor  if  its 
plate  separation  d  is  small  compared  to  its  diameter,  a  common  configuration.    Thus  Eo  =  v/d 
[V  m-1]  (3.1.2).  The  surface  charge  density  on  the  positive  end-plate  face  adjacent  to  the 
conducting medium is σs = εEo  [C m-2], and the total static charge Q on the positive end plate of 
area A is therefore: 

Q  A s	 A E o  A v d  = Cv [C ] 
= σ = ε 
= ε 

(3.1.9)

Therefore, for a parallel-plate capacitor: 

C = εA d   F[ arads

]  
 

 

(parallel-plate capacitor) 

(3.1.10) 

Using (3.1.2) and the fact that the charge Q(t) on the positive plate is the time integral of the 
current i(t) into it, we obtain the relation between voltage and current for a capacitor: 

C = (

(3.1.12)
 

When  two capacitors are connected  in parallel as shown  in Figure 3.1.2,  they are equivalent 
to a single capacitor of value Ceq storing charge Qeq, where these values are easily found in terms 
of the charges (Q1, Q2) and capacitances (C1, C2) associated with the two separate devices.

Because  the  total  charge  Qeq  is  the  sum  of  the  charges  on  the  two  separate  capacitors,  and 
capacitors in parallel have the same voltage v, it follows that: 

Qeq = Q1 + Q2 = (C1 + C2)v = Ceqv

voltage is the sum of the voltages across each capacitor:

The instantaneous electric energy density We [J m-3] between the capacitor plates is given by 
2
Poynting’s theorem:  We = ε E  2  (2.7.7).  The  total electric energy we stored  in  the capacitor  is 
the integral of We over the volume Ad of the dielectric: 
w e  = ∫∫∫  ( ε E

The corresponding expression  for  the  time-average energy stored  in a capacitor  in  the sinusoidal

We can also analyze other capacitor geometries,  such as  the cylindrical capacitor  illustrated

has permittivity ε.

The electric field again must be divergence- and curl-free in the charge-free regions between 
the  two  cylinders,  and  must  be  perpendicular  to  the  inner  and  outer  cylinders  at  their  perfectly 
conducting walls.  The  solution  can  be  cylindrically  symmetric  and  independent  of  φ.  A  purely 
radial electric field has these properties:

outer cylinder is negatively charged, and Eo is positive.  The total charge Q on the inner cylinder 
is then:

In  the  limit where  b/a →  1  and  b  -  a  =  d,  then we  have  approximately  a  parallel-plate  capacitor 
with C → εA/d where the plate area A = 2πaD; see (3.1.10). 

Example 3.1B 
Design a practical 100-volt 10-8 farad (0.01 mfd) capacitor using dielectric having ε = 20εo and a 
breakdown field strength EB of 107 [V m-1]. 

Solution:	 For  parallel-plate  capacitors  C  =  εA/d  (3.1.10),  and  the  device  breakdown  voltage  is 
EBd  =  100  [V].  Therefore  the  plate  separation  d  =  100/EB  =  10-5  [m].   With  a  safety 
factor  of  two,  d  doubles  to  2×10-5,  so  A  =  dC/ε  =  2×10-5  ×  10-8/(20  ×  6.85×10-12)  ≅ 
1.5×103  [m2].  If  the  capacitor  is  a  cube  of  side D,  then  the  capacitor  volume  is D3 = 
Ad  and D  =  (Ad)0.333 =  (1.5×10-3  × 2×10-5)0.333  ≅  3.1 mm.   To  simplify manufacture, 
such capacitors are usually wound in cylinders or cut from flat stacked sheets. 

3.2 

Inductors and transformers 

3.2.1 

Solenoidal inductors 

All  currents  in  devices  produce  magnetic  fields  that  store  magnetic  energy  and  therefore 
contribute  inductance  to  a  degree  that  depends  on  frequency.   When  two  circuit  branches  share 
magnetic  fields,  each will  typically  induce  a  voltage  in  the  other,  thus  coupling  the  branches  so 
they form a transformer, as discussed in Section 3.2.4. 

- 71 -


Inductors  are  two-terminal  passive  devices  specifically  designed  to  store  magnetic  energy, 
particularly  at  frequencies  below  some  design-dependent  upper  limit.    One  simple  geometry  is 
shown  in  Figure  3.2.1  in  which  current  i(t)  flows  in  a  loop  through  two  perfectly  conducting 
parallel plates of width W and length D, spaced d apart, and short-circuited at one end.

The  contour  C1  around  both  currents  in  Figure  3.2.1  encircles  zero  net  current,  and  (3.2.1)  says 
the  contour  integral  of  H   around  zero  net  current  must  be  zero  in  the  static  case.    Contour  C2 
encircles only the current i(t), so the contour integral of  H  around any C2 in the right-hand sense 
equals  i(t)  for  the  static case.   The values of  these  two contour  integrals are consistent with zero 
magnetic  field outside  the pair of plates and a constant  field  H H =  o yˆ  between  them, although a 
uniform  magnetic  field  could  be  superimposed  everywhere  without  altering  those  integrals. 
Since such a uniform field would not have  the same symmetry as  this device, such a field would 
have to be generated elsewhere.  These integrals are also exactly consistent with fringing fields at 
the edges of  the plate, as  illustrated  in Figure 3.2.1(b)  in  the x-y plane  for z > 0.   Fringing  fields 
can usually be neglected if the plate separation d is much less than the plate width W.

Since  we  assumed  fringing  fields  could  be  neglected  because  W  >>  d,  large  single-turn 
inductors  require  very  large  structures.    The  standard  approach  to  increasing  inductance  L  in  a 
limited volume is instead to use multi-turn coils as illustrated in Figure 3.2.3.

Figure 3.2.3  N-turn inductor: (a) solenoid, (b) toroid. 
 

The  N-turn  coil  of  Figure  3.2.3  duplicates  the  current  flow  geometry  illustrated  in  Figures 
3.2.1  and  3.2.2,  but  with  N  times  the  intensity  (A  m-1)  for  the  same  terminal  current  i(t),  and 
therefore  the magnetic  field Ho  and  flux ψm  are  also N  times  stronger  than  before.   At  the  same 
time  the  voltage  induced  in  each  turn  is  proportional  to  the  flux ψm  through  it, which  is  now N 
times greater than for a single-turn coil (ψm = NiμA/W), and the total voltage across the inductor 
is  the sum of  the voltages across  the N  turns.   Therefore, provided  that W >> d,  the  total voltage 
across an N-turn  inductor  is N2  times  its one-turn value, and  the  inductance LN of an N-turn coil 
is also N2 greater than L1 for a one-turn coil:

where A is the coil area and W is its length; W >>  A  > d. 

Equation  (3.2.11)  also  applies  to  cylindrical  coils  having  W  >>  d,  which  is  the  most 
common  form of  inductor.  To  achieve  large values of N  the  turns of wire  can be wound on  top 
of each other with little adverse effect; (3.2.11) still applies. 

These  expressions  can  also  be  simplified  by  defining  magnetic  flux  linkage  Λ as  the 
magnetic flux ψm (3.2.7) linked by N turns of the current i, where: 

Λ = Nψm = N(NiμA/W) = (N2μA/W)i = Li 

(flux linkage) 

(3.2.12) 

This  equation  Λ  =  Li  is  dual  to  the  expression  Q  =  Cv  for  capacitors.   We  can  use  (3.2.5)  and 
(3.2.12) to express the voltage v across N turns of a coil as: 

v = L di/dt = dΛ/dt

The net  inductance L of  two  inductors L1  and L2  in  series or parallel  is  related  to L1  and L2

(3.2.15) 

For  example,  two  inductors  in  series  convey  the  same  current  i  but  the  total  voltage  across  the 
pair is the sum of the voltages across each – so the inductances add. 

Example 3.2A 
Design a 100-Henry air-wound inductor. 

Solution:  	 Equation  (3.2.11)  says L = N2μA/W,  so N  and  the  form  factor A/W must  be  chosen. 
Since A = πr2 is the area of a cylindrical inductor of radius r, then W = 4r implies L = 
N2μπr/4.  Although  tiny  inductors  (small  r)  can  be  achieved  with  a  large  number  of 
turns N, N is limited by the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the coil rW and of the 
2, and is N ≅ r2/rw
2.  N is further limited if we want the resistive impedance R 
wire πrw
<<  jωL.  If  ωmin  is  the  lowest  frequency  of  interest,  then  we  want  R  ≅ ωminL/100  = 
2) [see (3.1.5)], where  the wire  length d ≅  2πrN.  These constraints eventually 
d/(σπrw
yield  the  desired  values  for  r  and  N  that  yield  the  smallest  inductor.    Example  3.2B 
carries these issues further. 

3.2.2  Toroidal inductors 

The prior discussion assumed μ  filled all  space.    If μ  is  restricted  to  the  interior of a  solenoid, L 
is  diminished  significantly,  but  coils  wound  on  a  high-μ  toroid,  a  donut-shaped  structure  as 
illustrated  in Figure 3.2.3(b), yield  the  full benefit of high values  for μ.  Typical values of μ  are 
~5000 to 180,000 for iron, and up to ~106 for special materials. 

Coils  wound  on  high-permeability  toroids  exhibit  significantly  less  flux  leakage  than 
solenoids.    Consider  the  boundary  between  air  and  a  high-permeability  material  (μ/μo  >>1),  as 
illustrated in Figure 3.2.4.

The  degree  to  which  B   is  parallel  or  perpendicular  to  the  illustrated  boundary  has  been 
diminished  substantially  for  the  purpose  of  clarity.    The  boundary  conditions  are  that  both  B⊥ 
and  H //  are continuous across any interface (2.6.5, 2.6.11).  Since  B = μH  in the permeable core 
and  B = μo H   in  air,  and  since  H //   is  continuous  across  the  boundary,  therefore  B//   changes 
In  contrast,  B⊥   is  the  same  on  both  sides. 
across  the  boundary  by  the  large  factor  μ/μο. 
Therefore,  as  suggested  in  Figure  3.2.4,  B2   in  air  is  nearly  perpendicular  to  the  boundary 
because  H // , and  therefore⎯B2//,  is so very small; note  that  the  figure has been scaled so  that  the 
arrows representing⎯H2 and⎯B2 have the same length when μ = μ0.

In  contrast,  B1   is  nearly  parallel  to  the  boundary  and  is  therefore  largely  trapped  there,  even  if 
that boundary curves, as shown  for a  toroid  in Figure 3.2.5.   The  reason magnetic  flux  is  largely 
trapped  within  high-μ  materials  is  also  closely  related  to  the  reason  current  is  trapped  within 
high-σ wires, as described in Section 4.3. 

The  inductance  of  a  toroidal  inductor  is  simply  related  to  the  linked  magnetic  flux  Λ  by 
(3.2.12) and (3.2.7): 

L = Λ =

where A is any cross-sectional area of the toroid.

Computing  H   is  easier  if  the  toroid  is  circular  and  has  a  constant  cross-section A which  is 
small  compared  to  the major  radius R  so  that R >>  A .  From Ampere’s  law we  learn  that  the 
integral of  H  around the 2πR circumference of this toroid is:

where  the  only  linked  current  is  i(t)  flowing  through  the  N  turns  of  wire  threading  the  toroid. 
Equation  (3.2.17) yields H ≅ Ni/2πR and  (3.2.16)  relates H  to L.  Therefore  the  inductance L of 
such a toroid found from (3.2.16) and (3.2.17) is:

The  inductance  is  proportional  to  μ, N2,  and  cross-sectional  area  A,  but  declines  as  the  toroid 
major  radius  R  increases.    The  most  compact  large-L  toroids  are  therefore  fat  (large  A)  with 
almost  no  hole  in  the  middle  (small  R);  the  hole  size  is  determined  by  N  (made  as  large  as 
possible) and  the wire diameter  (made  small).   The maximum acceptable  series  resistance of  the 
inductor limits N and the wire diameter; for a given wire mass [kg] this resistance is proportional 
to N2.

The  inductance  of  a  high-permeability  toroid  is  strongly  reduced  if  even  a  small  gap  of 
width d exists  in  the magnetic path, as shown in Figure 3.2.6.   The inductance L of a toroid with 
a gap of width d  can be  found using  (3.2.16), but  first we must  find  the magnitude of Hμ within 
the  toroid.  Again we  can  use  the  integral  form  of Ampere’s  law  for  a  closed  contour  along  the 
axis of the toroid, encircling the hole.

where  Hg  is  the  magnitude  of  H  within  the  gap.   Since  B⊥   is  continuous  across  the  gap  faces, 
μoHg  =  μHμ  and  these  two  equations  can  be  solved  for  the  two  unknowns,  Hg  and  Hμ.  The 
second  term Hgd can be neglected  if  the gap width d << 2πRμo/μ.  In  this  limiting case we have 
the same inductance as before, (3.2.18).  However, if A0.5 > d >> 2πRμo/μ, then Hg  ≅ Ni/d and:

Relative to (3.2.18) the inductance has been reduced by a factor of μo/μ and increased by a much 
smaller factor of 2πR/d, a significant net reduction even though the gap is small. 

Equation  (3.2.20)  suggests  how  small  air  gaps  in  magnetic  motors  limit  motor  inductance 
and  sometimes  motor  torque,  as  discussed  further  in  Section  6.3.    Gaps  can  be  useful  too.  For 
example,  if  μ is  non-linear  [μ =  f  (H)],  then  L  ≠  f (H)  if  the  gap  and  μo  dominate  L.    Also, 
inductance  dominated  by  gaps  can  store  more  energy  when  H  exceeds  saturation  (i.e.,

density of:

(3.2.21)

Since  the magnetic  field  is  uniform  within  the  volume  Ad  of  the  rectangular  inductor  of  Figure

That  (3.2.22)  is  valid  and  exact  for  any  inductance  L  can  be  shown  using  Poynting’s  theorem, 
which relates power P = vi at the device terminals to changes in energy storage:

Earlier  we  neglected  fringing  fields,  but  they  store  magnetic  energy  too.   We  can  compute 
them  accurately  using  the  Biot-Savart  law  (10.2.21),  which  is  derived  later  and  expresses  H 
directly in terms of the currents flowing in the inductor:

H r  =

The  magnetic  field  produced  by  current  J r( ')   diminishes  with  distance  squared,  and  therefore 
the  magnitude  of  the  uniform  field  H   within  the  inductor  is  dominated  by  currents  within  a 
distance of ~d of  the  inductor ends, where d  is  the nominal diameter or  thickness of  the  inductor 
[see  Figure  3.2.3(a)  and  assume  d  ≅ D  << W].    Therefore  H   at  the  center  of  the  end-face  of  a 
semi-infinite  cylindrical  inductor  has  precisely  half  the  strength  it  has  near  the  middle  of  the 
same  inductor  because  the  Biot-Savart  contributions  to  H   at  the  end-face  arise  only  from  one 
side of the end-face, not from both sides. 

(3.2.24) 

The energy density within a solenoidal inductor therefore diminishes within a distance of ~d 
from  each  end,  but  this  is  partially  compensated  in  (3.2.23)  by  the  neglected  magnetic  energy 
outside  the  inductor,  which  also  decays  within  a  distance  ~d.    For  these  reasons  fringing  fields 
are usually neglected  in  inductance  computations when d << W.   Because magnetic  flux  is non-
divergent, the reduced field intensity near the ends of solenoids implies that some magnetic field 
lines escape the coil there; they are fully trapped within the rest of the coil.

(3.2.26)

Example 3.2B 
Design  a  practical  100-Henry  inductor wound  on  a  toroid  having  μ  =  104μo;  it  is  to  be  used  for 
ω ≅  400  [r  s-1]  (~60  Hz).  How  many  Joules  can  it  store  if  the  current  is  one  Ampere?  If  the 
residual flux density Br of the toroid is 0.2 Tesla, how does this affect design? 

Solution: 	 We have at least three unknowns, i,e., size, number of turns N, and wire radius rw, and 
therefore need at least three equations.  Equation (3.2.18) says L ≅ μN2A/2πRm where 
A  =  πr2.  A  fat  toroid  might  have  major  radius  Rm  ≅  3r,  corresponding  to  a  central 
hole  of  radius  2r  surrounded  by  an  iron  torus  2r  thick,  yielding  an  outer  diameter  of 
4r.  Our  first  equation  follows:  L  =  100  ≅ μN2r/6.  Next,  the  number  N  of  turns  is 
limited  by  the  ratio  of  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the  hole  in  the  torus  (π4r2)  and  the 
2;  our  second  equation  is  N  ≅  4r2/rw
2.  Although 
cross-sectional  area  of  the  wire  πrw
tiny  inductors  (small  r)  can  be  achieved  with  large  N,  N  is  limited  if  we  want  the 
resistive  impedance  R  <<  ωL.  If  ωmin  is  the  lowest  frequency  of  interest,  then  we 
2)  [see  (3.1.5)],  where  the 
obtain  our  third  equation,  R  ≅ ωminL/100  =  400  =  d/(σπrw
2 from the second and third equation yields N2  ≅ 
wire length d ≅ 4πrN.  Eliminating rw
400σr, and eliminating N2 from  the first equation yields r = (600/400σμ)0.5  ≅ 1.5mm, 
where  for  typical  wires  σ ≅  5×107;  the  maximum  diameter  of  this  toroid  is  8r  ≅  1.2 
cm. Since N2  ≅ 400σr, therefore N ≅ 5600, and rw  ≅ 2r/  N ≅ 40 microns. 

We might suppose the stored energy wm = Li2/2 = 100×12/2 = 50 joules.  However, if 
1  ampere  flows  through  5600  turns,  and  if  H  =  5600/2π3r  =  5600/0.031  =  1.8×105 
[A  m-1],  then  B  =  μH  ≅  2300  Tesla,  well  above  the  limit  of  Br  =  0.2  Tesla  where 
saturation  was  said  to  occur.    Since  the  incremental  μo  applies  at  high  currents,  this 
device  is  quite  non-linear  and  the  computed  stored  energy  of  50J  should  be  reduced 
by  a  factor  of  ~μo/μ  to  yield  ~5  mJ.    If  linearity  and  low  loss  (R<<ωL)  are  desired, 
either  this  toroid must  be made much  larger  so  that  the  upper  limit  on  μH  inside  the 
toroid  is  not  exceeded,  or  the  maximum  current  must  be  reduced  to  the  ~100  μA 
level.  Moreover,  a  sinusoidal  current  of  1  ampere  through  this  small  400-ohm 
resistance would dissipate 200 W, enough to damage it.  Note that if ωmin is increased 
by a factor of F, then r decreases by F0.5.

3.2.4  Transformers 

Transformers  are  passive  devices  used  to  raise  or  lower  the  voltages  of  alternating  currents  or 
transients.    The  voltage  v  across  two  terminals  of  any  coil  can  be  found  using  Faraday’s  law

Its  high  permeability  traps  the  magnetic  flux  within  it  so  that  ψm  is  constant  around  the  toroid, 
even though A varies.  From (3.2.28) we see that the voltage vk across coil k is therefore:

(3.2.31)

 
If current i2 flows in the output coil, then there will be an added contribution to v1 and v2 due 
to  the  contributions of  i2  to  the original ψm  from  the  input  coil  alone.  Note  that  current  flowing 
into  the  “+”  terminal  of  both  coils  in  the  figure  contribute  to⎯H  in  the  illustrated  direction;  this 

- 80 -


distinguishes  the  positive  terminal  from  the  negative  terminal  of  each  coil.    If  the  flux  coupling 
between  the  two  coils  is  imperfect,  then  the  output  voltage  is  correspondingly  reduced.    Any 
resistance in the wires can increment these voltages in proportion to the currents. 

Figure  3.2.8  suggests  traditional  symbols  used  to  represent  ideal  transformers  and  some 
common configurations used in practice.  The polarity dot at the end of each coil indicates which 
terminals would register  the same voltage for a given change  in  the  linked magnetic flux.   In  the 
absence of dots,  the polarity  indicated  in  (a)  is understood.   Note  that many  transformers consist 
of  a  single  coil  with  multiple  taps.    Sometimes  one  of  the  taps  is  a  commutator  that  can  slide 
across  the  coil  windings  to  provide  a  continuously  variable  transformer  turns  ratio.    As 
illustrated,  the  presence  of  an  iron  core  is  indicated  by  parallel  lines  and  an  auto-transformer 
consists of only one tapped coil.

The  terminal  voltages  of  linear  transformers  for  which  μ ≠  f(H)  are  linearly  related  to  the 
various currents flowing through the windings.  Consider a simple toroid for which H, B, and the 
cross-sectional  area  A  are  the  same  everywhere  around  the  average  circumference  πD.    In  this  
case the voltage V1 across the N1 turns of coil (1) is: 

V1 = jωN1 

Ψ = μHA 

H = (N1I1 + N2I2)/πD 

Therefore: 

V1 = jω[μAN1(N1I1 + N2I2)/πD] = jω(L11I1 + L12I2) 

where the self-inductance L11 and mutual inductance L12 [Henries] are: 

L11 = μAN1

voltage  source drives  the  load  resistor R  through  the  transformer, which has N1 and N2  turns on 
its input and output, respectively.  The toroid has major diameter D and cross-sectional area A.

Combining  (3.2.33)  and  (3.2.34),  and  noting  that  the  sign  of  I2  has  been  reversed  in  the

Ψ = μA (N1I1 + N2I2)/πD 

(3.2.38) 

We can find the admittance seen by the voltage source by solving (3.2.38) for I1 and dividing by 
Vs: 

I1 = (πDΨ/μAN1) + I2 N2/N1 

Vs = jωN1Ψ = V2N1/N2 = I2RN1/N2

(3.2.42) 

Thus the admittance seen at the input to the transformer is that of the self-inductance (1/jωL11) in 
parallel with  the  admittance  of  the  transformed  resistance  [(N2/N1)2/R].   The  power  delivered  to 
the  load  is  |V2|2/2R  =  |V1|2(N2/N1)2/2R,  which  is  the  time-average  power  delivered  to  the 
transformer, since |V2|2 = |V1|2(N2/N1)2; see (3.2.31). 

The  transformer  equivalent  circuit  is  thus  L11  in  parallel  with  the  input  of  an  ideal 
transformer  with  turns  ratio  N2/N1.  Resistive  losses  in  the  input  and  output  coils  could  be 
represented by  resistors  in  series with  the  input and output  lines.   Usually  jωL11  for an  iron-core 
transformer is so great that only the ideal transformer is important. 

One  significant  problem  with  iron-core  transformers  is  that  the  changing  magnetic  fields 
within them can generate considerable voltages and eddy currents by virtue of Ohm’s Law (⎯J = 
σ⎯E) and Faraday’s law:

where  the  contour C  circles  each  conducting   magnetic  element.   A  simple  standard method  for 
reducing  the  eddy  currents⎯J  and  the  associated  dissipated  power  ∫V  (σ|J|2/2)dv  is  to  reduce  the 
area  A  by  laminating  the  core;  i.e.,  by  fabricating  it  with  thin  stacked  insulated  slabs  of  iron  or 
steel oriented so as to interrupt the eddy currents.  The eddy currents flow perpendicular to⎯H, so 
the slab should be sliced along  the direction of⎯H.  If N stacked slabs  replace a single slab,  then 
A,  E,  and  J  are  each  reduced  roughly  by  a  factor  of  N,  so  the  power  dissipated,  which  is 
proportional to the square of J, is reduced by a factor of ~N2.  Eddy currents and laminated cores 
are discussed further at the end of Section 4.3.3.

3.3  Quasistatic behavior of devices 

3.3.1  Electroquasistatic behavior of devices 

The  voltages  and  currents  associated  with  all  interesting  devices  sometimes  vary.    If  the 
wavelength  λ  =  c/f  associated  with  these  variations  is  much  larger  than  the  device  size  D,  no 
significant  wave  behavior  can  occur.  The  device  behavior  can  then  be  characterized  as 
electroquasistatic  if  the  device  stores  primarily  electric  energy,  and  magnetoquasistatic  if  the 
device  stores  primarily  magnetic  energy.    Electroquasistatics  involves  the  behavior  of  electric 
fields  plus  the  first-order  magnetic  consequences  of  their  variations.    The  electroquasistatic 
approximation  includes  the  magnetic  field⎯H  generated  by  the  varying  dominant  electric  field 
(Ampere’s law), where:  

H = E  ∂D 
∇ × 
σ +
∂t 

(3.3.1)

The  quasistatic  approximation  neglects  the  second-order  electric  field  contributions  from  the 
time derivative of the resulting⎯H in Faraday’s law:  ∇ E  −μ ∂ H / ∂ ≅ 
t  0 .
× =

One  simple  geometry  involving  slowly  varying  electric  fields  is  a  capacitor  charged  to 
voltage V(t),  as  illustrated  in  Figure  3.3.1.  It  consists  of  two  circular  parallel  conducting  plates 
of  diameter  D  and  area  A  that  are  separated  in  vacuum  by  the  distance  d  <<  D.    Boundary 
conditions  require⎯E  to  be  perpendicular  to  the  plates,  where  E(t)  =  V(t)/d,  and  the  surface 
charge density is given by (2.6.15):

Figure 3.3.1  Quasistatic electric and magnetic fields in a circular capacitor. 
 

Since  the  voltage  across  the  plates  is  the  same  everywhere,  so  are⎯E  and  ρs,  and  therefore  the 
total charge is: 

Q(t) ≅ ρsA ≅ (εoA/d)V = CV(t) 

(3.3.4) 

where C ≅ εoA/d  is  the  capacitance,  as  shown  earlier  (3.1.10).   The  same  surface  charge density 
ρs(t)  can  also  be  found  by  evaluating  first  the  magnetic  field⎯H(r,t)  produced  by  the  slowly 
varying  (quasistatic)  electric  field⎯E(t),  and  then  the  surface  current⎯Js(r,t)  associated 
with⎯H(r,t); charge conservation then links⎯Js(r,t) to ρs(t). 

Ampere’s law requires a non-zero magnetic field between the plates where⎯J = 0: 
•  = ε o ∫∫ A ′ ( ∂E ∂t ) • da 
(cid:118)∫C
H ds  
Symmetry  of  geometry  and  excitation  requires  that⎯H  between  the  plates  be  in  the  φˆ direction 
and a function only of radius r, so (3.3.5) becomes: 

(3.3.5) 

2πr H(r) = εoπr2 dE/dt = (εoπr2/d) dV/dt 

H(r) = (εor/2d) dV/dt 

(3.3.6) 

(3.3.7) 

If V(t)  and  the magnetic  field H  are  varying  so  slowly  that  the  electric  field  given  by  Faraday’s 
law  for H(r)  is much  less  than  the  original  electric  field,  then  that  incremental  electric  field  can 
be  neglected,  which  is  the  essence  of  the  electroquasistatic  approximation.    If  it  cannot  be 
neglected, then the resulting solution becomes more wavelike, as discussed in later sections. 

The boundary condition  nˆ  ×⎯H =⎯Js (2.6.17) then yields the associated surface current⎯Js(r) 
flowing on the interior surface of the top plate: 

⎯Js(r) =  rˆ (εor/2d) dV/dt =  rˆ Jsr 

(3.3.8) 

- 84 -


This  in  turn  is  related  to  the  surface charge density ρs by conservation of charge  (2.1.19), where 
the del operator is in cylindrical coordinates: 

∇ •⎯Js = -∂ρs/∂t = - r-1∂ (r Jsr)/∂r 

Substituting Jsr from (3.3.8) into the right-hand side of (3.3.9) yields: 

∂ρs/∂t = (εo/d) dV/dt 

(3.3.9) 

(3.3.10) 

Multiplying both  sides of  (3.3.10) by  the plate  area A  and  integrating over  time  then yields Q(t) 
=  CV(t),  which  is  the  same  as  (3.3.4).    Thus  we  could  conclude  that  variations  in  V(t)  will 
produce  magnetic  fields  between  capacitor  plates  by  virtue  of  Ampere’s  law  and  the  values  of 
either  D t   between  the  capacitor  plates  or⎯Js  within  the  plates.    These  two  approaches  to
∂
∂
finding⎯H  (using  D t   or⎯Js)  yield  the  same  result  because  of  the  self-consistency  of 
∂
∂
Maxwell’s equations. 

Because  the curl of⎯H  in Ampere’s  law equals  the sum of current density⎯J and  D t
∂  ,  the 
∂
derivative  D t  is often called the displacement current density because the units are the same, 
∂
∂
A/m2.  For  the  capacitor  of  Figure  3.3.1  the  curl  of⎯H  near  the  feed  wires  is  associated  only 
with⎯J  (or  I),  whereas  between  the  capacitor  plates  the  curl  of⎯H  is  associated  only  with 
displacement current. 

Section  3.3.4  treats  the  electroquasistatic  behavior  of  electric  fields  within  conductors  and 
relaxation phenomena. 

3.3.2  Magnetoquasistatic behavior of devices 

All  currents  produce magnetic  fields  that  in  turn  generate  electric  fields  if  those magnetic  fields 
vary.  Magnetoquasistatics  characterizes  the  behavior  of  such  slowly  varying  fields  while 
neglecting the second-order magnetic fields generated by  ∂D t  in Ampere’s law, (2.1.6): 
∂

∇ × H J =  + ∂ D  t 
∂ ≅ J  

(quasistatic Ampere’s law) 

(3.3.11)

The associated electric field⎯E can then be found from Faraday's law: 

∇ × E = −∂ B ∂t  

(Faraday’s law) 

(3.3.12) 

Section  3.2.1  treated  an  example  for  which  the  dominant  effect  of  the  quasistatic magnetic 
field  in  a  current  loop  is  voltage  induced  via  Faraday’s  law,  while  the  example  of  a  short  wire 
follows;  both  are  inductors.  Section  3.3.4  treats  the  magnetoquasistatic  example  of  magnetic 
diffusion,  which  is  dominated  by  currents  induced  by  the  first-order  induced  voltages,  and 
resulting  modification  of  the  original  magnetic  field  by  those  induced  currents.    In  every 
quasistatic  problem  wave  effects  can  be  neglected  because  the  associated  wavelength  λ  >>  D, 
where D is the maximum device dimension.

We  can  roughly  estimate  the  inductance  of  a  short  wire  segment  by  modeling  it  as  a 
perfectly  conducting  cylinder  of  radius  ro  and  length  D  carrying  a  current  i(t),  as  illustrated  in 
Figure 3.3.2.  An  exact  computation would normally be done using  computer  tools designed  for 
such  tasks because analytic solutions are practical only  for extremely simple geometries.    In  this 
analysis  we  neglect  any  contributions  to⎯H  from  currents  in  nearby  conductors,  which  requires 
those  nearby  conductors  to  have  much  larger  diameters  or  be  far  away.    We  also  make  the 
   
quasistatic assumption λ >> D.

We  know  from  (3.2.23)  that  the  inductance  of  any  device  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the

H ≅θH  r   must obey Ampere’s law and exhibit the same cylindrical symmetry, as suggested in

To  find  the  total  average  stored magnetic  energy we must  integrate  over  volume.   Laterally 
 
we  can  neglect  fringing  fields  and  simply  integrate  over  the  length D.    Integration with  respect 
to  radius  will  produce  a  logarithmic  answer  that  becomes  infinite  if  the  maximum  radius  is 
infinite.    A  plausible  outer  limit  for  r  is  ~D  because  the  Biot-Savart  law  (1.4.6)  says  fields 
decrease  as  r2  from  their  source  if  that  source  is  local;  the  transition  from  slow  cylindrical  field 
decay  as  r-1  to  decay  as  r-2  occurs  at  distances  r  comparable  to  the  largest  dimension  of  the 
source: r ≅ D.  With these approximations we find:

here  because  we  are  integrating  energy  densities,  which  are  squares  of  field  strengths,  and  the 
outer  limit  of  the  integral  (3.3.16)  is  wire  length  D,  so  longer  wires  have  slightly  more 
inductance than the sum of shorter elements into which they might be subdivided. 

3.3.3  Equivalent circuits for simple devices 

Section  3.1  showed  how  the  parallel  plate  resistor  of  Figure  3.1.1  would  exhibit  resistance  R  = 
d/σA  ohms  and  capacitance  C  =  εA/d  farads,  connected  in  parallel.    The  currents  in  the  same 
device also generate magnetic fields and add inductance.  

Referring  to  Figure  3.1.1  of  the  original  parallel  plate  resistor,  most  of  the  inductance  will 
arise  from  the wires,  since  they have  a very  small  radius  ro  compared  to  that of  the plates.   This 
inductance L will be in series with the RC portions of the device because their two voltage drops 
add.  The R and C components are  in parallel because  the  total current  through  the device  is  the 
sum  of  the  conduction  current  and  the  displacement  current,  and  the  voltages  driving  these  two 
currents are  the same,  i.e.,  the voltage between  the parallel plates.   The corresponding first-order 
equivalent circuit is illustrated in Figure 3.3.3.

Figure 3.3.3  Equivalent RLC circuit of a parallel-plate capacitor. 
 

Examination  of  Figure  3.3.3  suggests  that  at  very  low  frequencies  the  resistance  R 
dominates because,  relative  to  the  resistor,  the  inductor and capacitor become approximate  short 
and  open  circuits,  respectively.    At  the  highest  frequencies  the  inductor  dominates.    As  f 
increases  from  zero  beyond where R  dominates,  either  the RL  or  the RC  circuit  first  dominates, 
depending  on whether C  shorts  the  resistance R  at  lower  frequencies  than when  L  open-circuits 
R;  that  is,  RC  dominates  first  when  R  >  L/C .    At  still  higher  frequencies  the  LC  circuit 
dominates,  followed  by L  alone.    For  certain  combinations  of R, L,  and C,  some  transitions  can 
merge.

Even  this  model  for  a  resistor  is  too  simple;  for  example,  the  wires  also  exhibit  resistance 
and  there  is magnetic energy stored between the end plates because  ∂D dt  ≠ 0  there.  Since such 
parasitic  effects  typically  become  important  only  at  frequencies  above  the  frequency  range 
specified for  the device,  they are normally neglected.   Even more complex behavior can result  if 
the  frequencies are so high  that  the device dimensions exceed ~λ/8, as discussed  later  in Section 
7.1.  Similar  considerations  apply  to  every  resistor,  capacitor,  inductor,  or  transformer 
manufactured.   Components and circuits designed  for very high  frequencies minimize unwanted 
parasitic  capacitance  and  parasitic  inductance  by  their  very  small  size  and  proper  choice  of 
materials and geometry.  It is common for circuit designers using components or wires near their 
design  limits  to  model  them  with  simple  lumped-element  equivalent  circuits  like  that  of  Figure 
3.3.3, which include the dominant parasitic effects.  The form of these circuits obviously depends 
on the detailed structure of the modeled device; for example, R and C might be in series. 

Example 3.3A 
What  are  the  approximate  values  L  and  C  for  the100-Ω  resistor  designed  in  Example  3.1A  if 
ε = 4εo, and what are the three critical frequencies (RC)-1, R/L, and (LC)-0.5? 

Solution:	 The  solution  to  3.1A  said  the  conducting  caps  of  the  resistor  have  area  A  =  πr2  = 
π(2.5×10-4)2,  and  the  length  of  the  dielectric  d  is  1 mm.   The  permittivity  ε  =  4εo,  so 
the  capacitance  (3.1.10)  is  C  =  εA/d  =  4×8.85×10-12×π(2.5×10-4)2/10-3  ≅  7×10-15 
farads.  The  inductance L  of  this  device would  probably  be  dominated  by  that  of  the 
connecting  wires  because  their  diameters  would  be  smaller  and  their  length  longer. 
Assume  the  wire  length  is  D  =  4d  =  4×10-3,  and  its  radius  r  is  10-4.  Then  (3.3.17) 
(1.26×10-6

yields  L

3.7×10-10  [Hy].  The  critical  frequencies  R/L,  (RC)-1,  and  (LC)-0.5  are  2.7×1011, 
6.2×1011,  and  1.4×1012  [r  s-1],  respectively,  so  the  maximum  frequency  for  which 
reasonably pure resistance is obtained is ~10 GHz (~R/2πL4). 

3.4  General circuits and solution methods 

3.4.1  Kirchoff’s laws 

Circuits  are  generally  composed  of  lumped  elements  or  “branches”  connected  at  nodes  to  form 
two- or three-dimensional structures, as suggested in Figure 3.4.1.  They can be characterized by 
the voltages vi at each node or across each branch, or by the currents ij flowing in each branch or 
in  a  set  of  current  loops.  To  determine  the  behavior  of  such  circuits  we  develop  simultaneous 
linear  equations  that  must  be  satisfied  by  the  unknown  voltages  and  currents.    Kirchoff’s  laws 
generally provide these equations. 

Although circuit analysis  is often based  in part on Kirchoff’s  laws,  these  laws are  imperfect 
due to electromagnetic effects.   For example, Kirchoff’s voltage  law (KVL) says  that  the voltage 
drops vi associated with each lumped element around any loop must sum to zero, i.e.: 
∑ i vi  = 0	

(Kirchoff’s voltage law [KVL])

  across  any  branch  yields  the  voltage  across  that  branch.    Therefore  the 
This  integral  of  E ds•
sum  of  branch  voltages  around  any  closed  contour  is  zero  if  the  net  magnetic  flux  through  that 
contour is constant; this is the basic assumption of KVL. 

KVL  is  clearly  valid  for  any  static  circuit.    However,  any  branch  carrying  time  varying 
current will contribute time varying magnetic flux and therefore voltage to all adjacent loops plus 
others nearby.  These voltage contributions are typically negligible because the currents and loop 
areas are  small  relative  to  the wavelengths of  interest  (λ = c/f) and  the KVL approximation  then 
applies.  A standard approach to analyzing circuits that violate KVL is to determine the magnetic 
energy  or  inductance  associated with  any  extraneous magnetic  fields,  and  to model  their  effects 
in the circuit with a lumped parasitic inductance in each affected current loop. 

The companion relation to KVL is Kirchoff’s current law (KCL), which says that the sum of 
the currents ij flowing into any node is zero: 
∑ j i j  = 0 

(Kirchoff’s current law) 

(3.4.3) 

This  follows  from  conservation  of  charge  (2.4.19)  when  no  charge  storage  on  the  nodes  is 
allowed:

For  static  problems,  KCL  is  exact.    However,  the  physical  nodes  and  the  wires  connecting

that such parasitic capacitance at any node becomes  important,  that parasitic capacitance can be 
modeled as an additional lumped element attached to that node.

Solving circuit problems 

To  determine  the  behavior  of  any  given  linear  lumped  element  circuit  a  set  of  simultaneous 
equations  must  be  solved,  where  the  number  of  equations  must  equal  or  exceed  the  number  of 
unknowns.  The unknowns are generally  the voltages and currents on each branch;  if  there are b 
branches there are 2b unknowns. 

Figure  3.4.2(a)  illustrates  a  simple  circuit  with  b  =  12  branches,  p  =  6  loops,  and  n  =  7 
nodes.  A  set  of  loop  currents  uniquely  characterizes  all  currents  if  each  loop  circles  only  one 
“hole”  in  the  topology  and  if  no  additional  loops  are  added  once  every  branch  in  the  circuit  is 
incorporated in at least one loop.  Although other definitions for the loop currents can adequately 
characterize  all  branch  currents,  they  are  not  explored  here.    Figure  3.4.2(b)  illustrates  a  bridge 
circuit with b = 6, p = 3, and n = 4.

As  we  add  either  nodes  or  branches  to  the  illustrated  circuit  in  any  sequence  and  with  any 
placement, Equation (3.4.5) is always obeyed.  If we add voltage or current sources to the circuit, 
they too become branches. 

The voltage  and  current  for  each branch  are  initially unknown  and  therefore  any  circuit has 
2b  unknowns.  The  number  of  equations  is  also  b  +  (n  –  1)  +  p  =  2b,  where  the  first  b  in  this 
expression  corresponds  to  the  equations  relating  voltage  to  current  in  each  branch,  n-1  is  the 
number of independent KCL equations, and p is the number of loops and KVL equations; (3.4.5) 
says  (n – 1) + p = b.  Therefore, since  the numbers of unknowns and  linear equations match, we 
may  solve  them.    The  equations  are  linear  because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear  for  RLC 
circuits. 

Often  circuits  are  so  complex  that  it  is  convenient  for  purposes  of  analysis  to  replace  large 
sections  of  them  with  either  a  two-terminal  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  or  Norton  equivalent 
circuit.  This  can  be  done  only when  that  circuit  is  incrementally  linear with  respect  to  voltages 
imposed at its terminals.  Thevenin equivalent circuits consist of a voltage source VTh(t) in series 
with a passive  linear circuit characterized by  its frequency-dependent  impedance Z(ω) = R +  jΧ, 
while Norton  equivalent  circuits  consist  of  a  current  source  INo(t)  in  parallel with  an  impedance 
Z(ω). 

An  important  example  of  the  utility  of  equivalent  circuits  is  the  problem  of  designing  a 
matched  load  ZL(ω)  =  RL(ω)  +  jXL(ω)  that  accepts  the  maximum  amount  of  power  available 
from  a  linear  source  circuit,  and  reflects  none.  The  solution  is  simply  to  design  the  load  so  its 
impedance 
ZL(ω) 
impedance:

the

the 
is 
ZL(ω) = Z*(ω).   For both Thevenin  and Norton  equivalent  sources  the  reactance of  the matched 
load cancels that of the source [XL(ω) = - X(ω)] and the two resistive parts are set equal, R = RL. 

One  proof  that  a  matched  load  maximizes  power  transfer  consists  of  computing  the  time-
average  power  Pd  dissipated  in  the  load  as  a  function  of  its  impedance,  equating  to  zero  its 
derivative  dPd/dω,  and  solving  the  resulting  complex  equation  for  RL  and  XL.  We  exclude  the 
possibility  of  negative  resistances  here  unless  those  of  the  load  and  source  have  the  same  sign; 
otherwise the transferred power can be infinite if RL = -R. 

Example 3.4A 
The  bridge  circuit  of  Figure  3.4.2(b)  has  five  branches  connecting  four  nodes  in  every  possible 
way  except  one.  Assume  both  parallel  branches  have  0.1-ohm  and  0.2-ohm  resistors  in  series, 
but  in  reverse  order  so  that  R1  =  R4  =  0.1,  and  R2  =  R3  =  0.2.   What  is  the  resistance  R  of  the 
bridge  circuit  between  nodes  a  and  d  if  R5  =  0?   What  is  R  if  R5  =  ∞?  What  is  R  if  R5  is  0.5 
ohms? 

Solution:  When  R5  =  0  then  the  node  voltages  vb  =  vc,  so  R1  and  R3  are  connected  in  parallel 
and  have  the  equivalent  resistance  R13//.  Kirchoff’s  current  law  “KCL”  (3.4.3)  says 
-1  + R3
-1).  If Vab  ≡  (va  -  vb),  then 
the  current  flowing  into  node  “a”  is  I  =  (va  -  vb)(R1
-1)-1 =  (10+5)-1 = 0.067Ω = R24//.  These  two circuits 
-1 + R3
Vab =  IR13// and R13// =  (R1
are in series so their resistances add: R = R13// + R24//  ≅ 0.133 ohms.  When R5 = ∞, R1 

- 91 -


and R2 are in series with a total resistance R12s of 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3Ω = R34s.  These two 
-1)-1 = 0.15Ω.  When R5 
-1 + R34s 
resistances, R12s  and R34s  are  in parallel,  so R =  (R12s
is  finite,  then  simultaneous  equations  must  be  solved.    For  example,  the  currents 
flowing  into  each  of  nodes  a,  b,  and  c  sum  to  zero,  yielding  three  simultaneous 
equations  that  can  be  solved  for  the  vector  V = [ v   , v   , v   ] ;  we  define  vd  =  0.  Thus

-1 = 15va - 10vb - 5vc.  KCL 
(va - vb)/R1 + (va - vc)/R3 = I = va(R1
for nodes b and c similarly yield: -10va + 17vb - 2vc = 0, and -5va  -2vb + 17vc = 0.  If 
we define the current vector  I  = [I, 0, 0], then these three equations can be written as 
a matrix equation: 

⎡ 15  −10  −5⎤ 
⎢−10
⎥ . 
G v  = I , where  G = ⎢

⎣
⎦ 

 

Since  the  desired  circuit  resistance  between  nodes  a  and  d  is  R  =  va/I,  we  need  only 
−1 
solve  for  va  in  terms  of  I,  which  follows  from  = 
I
v G 
,  provided  the  conductance 
matrix G is  not  singular  (here  it  is  not).    Thus  R  =  0.146Ω,  which  is  intermediate 
between the first two solutions, as it should be.

Two-element circuits and RLC resonators 

3.5.1  Two-element circuits and uncoupled RLC resonators 

RLC  resonators  typically consist of a  resistor R,  inductor L, and capacitor C connected  in  series 
or  parallel,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  3.5.1.    RLC  resonators  are  of  interest  because  they  behave 
much  like  other  electromagnetic  systems  that  store  both  electric  and  magnetic  energy,  which 
slowly  dissipates  due  to  resistive  losses.    First we  shall  find  and  solve  the  differential  equations 
that  characterize RLC  resonators  and  their  simpler  sub-systems: RC, RL,  and LC  circuits.   This 
will  lead  to  definitions  of  resonant  frequency  ωo  and  Q,  which  will  then  be  related  in  Section 
3.5.2 to the frequency response of RLC resonators that are coupled to circuits.

Kirchoff’s  voltage  law  applied  to  the  series  RLC  circuit  of  Figure  3.5.1(a)  says  that  the  sum  of 
the voltages (3.5.1), (3.5.2), and (3.5.3) is zero: 

 

(3.5.3) 

2d  i  dt 2 + ( R L  di dt + (1 LC  i ) = 0 
) 

(3.5.4) 

where we  have  divided  by  L  and  differentiated  to  simplify  the  equation.   Before  solving  it,  it  is 
useful  to  solve  simpler  versions  for  RC,  RL,  and  LC  circuits, where we  ignore  one  of  the  three 
elements. 

In the RC limit where L = 0 we add (3.5.1) and (3.5.3) to yield the differential equation: 

di dt + (1 RC  i ) = 0 

(3.5.5) 

This says that i(t) can be any function with the property that the first derivative is the same as the 
original signal,  times a constant.   This property  is restricted  to exponentials and  their sums, such 
as sines and cosines.  Let's represent i(t) by Ioest, where: 
i t  = R  {I  e

(3.5.6) 

where the complex frequency s is:

We can substitute (3.5.6) into (3.5.5) to yield: 
Re {⎡s + (1 RC )⎤ I e  } = 0

⎣ 
⎦ o
Since est is not always zero, to satisfy (3.5.8) it follows that s = - 1/RC and:

(RC current response) 

(3.5.9)

where τ equals RC seconds and is the RC time constant.  Io is chosen to satisfy initial conditions, 
which were not given here. 

A simple example  illustrates how  initial conditions can be  incorporated  in  the solution.   We 
simply need as many equations  for  t = 0 as  there are unknown variables.    In  the present case we 
need one equation to determine Io.  Suppose the RC circuit [of Figure 3.5.1(a) with L = 0] was at 

- 93 -


rest at t = 0, but the capacitor was charged to Vo volts.  Then we know that the initial current Io at 
t = 0 must be Vo/R. 

In the RL limit where C = ∞ we add (3.5.1) and (3.5.2) to yield di/dt + (R/L)i = 0, which has 
the same form of solution (3.5.6), so that s = -R/L and:

(RL current response) 

(3.5.10)

where the RL time constant τ is L/R seconds. 

In the LC limit where R = 0 we add (3.5.2) and (3.5.3) to yield: 

2d i  dt 2 + (1 LC i  
) = 0 

(3.5.11) 

Its  solution  also  has  the  form  (3.5.6).    Because  i(t)  is  real  and  ejωt  is  complex,  it  is  easier  to 
assume sinusoidal  solutions, where  the phase φ and magnitude  Io would be determined by  initial 
conditions.  This form of the solution would be: 

i t( ) = Io cos  ( ω  + φ

Figure  3.5.2  illustrates  how  the  current  and  energy  storage  decays  exponentially  with  time 
while undergoing conversion between electric and magnetic energy storage at 2ω radians s-1; the 
time constant for current and voltage is τ = 2L/R seconds, and that for energy is L/R. 

One useful way to characterize a resonance is by the dimensionless quantity Q, which is the 
number  of  radians  required  before  the  total  energy  wT  decays  to  1/e  of  its  original  value,  as 
illustrated in Figure 3.5.2(b).  That is:

An  important  characteristic  of  a  resonator  is  the  frequency  dependence  of  its  power

at  infinite  and  zero  frequency,  respectively.    The  total  frequency  response  Pd(f)  of  this  series 
RLC  resonator  is  suggested  in Figure  3.5.4.  The  resonator bandwidth  or  half-power  bandwidth 
Δω  is  said  to  be  the  difference  between  the  two  half-power  frequencies,  or  Δω ≅ 2α =  R/L  for

follows from (3.5.21):

Resonators  reduce  to  their  resistors  at  resonance  because  the  impedance  of  the  LC  portion 
approaches  zero  or  infinity  for  series  or  parallel  resonators,  respectively.    At  resonance  Pd  is 
maximized  when  the  source  Rs  and  load  R  resistances  match,  as  is  easily  shown  by  setting  the 
derivative  dPd/dR =  0  and  solving  for R.    In  this  case we  say  the  resonator  is  critically matched 
to its source, for all available power is then transferred to the load at resonance. 

This  critically matched  condition  can  also  be  related  to  the Q’s  of  a  coupled  resonator with 
zero Thevenin voltage applied from outside, where we define internal Q (or QI) as corresponding 
to  power  dissipated  internally  in  the  resonator,  external  Q  (or  QE)  as  corresponding  to  power 
dissipated externally  in  the source  resistance, and  loaded Q  (or QL) as corresponding  to  the  total 
power dissipated both internally (PDI) and externally (PDE).  That is, following (3.5.23): 

QI  ≡ ωwT  PDI

 

QE  ≡ ωwT  PDE

 

 

 

QL  ≡ ωw T  ( PDI  + PDE )  

Therefore these Q’s are simply related:

Since  the  source  and  load  resistances  are  matched  for  maximum  power  dissipation  at 
resonance,  it  follows  from Figure 3.5.3  that  a  critically  coupled  resonator or matched  resonator 
results  when  QI  =  QE.  These  expressions  for  Q  are  in  terms  of  energies  stored  and  power 
dissipated,  and  can  readily  be  applied  to  electromagnetic  resonances  of  cavities  or  other 
structures,  yielding  their  bandwidths  and  conditions  for  maximum  power  transfer  to  loads,  as 
discussed in Section 9.4.

As  shown  in  (1.3.5),  Gauss’s  law  (4.1.3)  leads  to  the  result  that  a  single  point  charge  Q  at  the 
origin in vacuum yields produces an electric field at radius r of: 

⎯E(r) =  rˆ Q/4πεor2 

(4.1.5) 

Superposition  of  such  contributions  to  E( r )   from  a  charge  distribution  ρ( r ')   located within  the 
volume V' yields:

Any  static  electric  field  can  be  related  to  an  electric  potential  distribution Φ[volts]  because

Similarly,  in  current-free  regions  of  space ∇  ×⎯H  =  0  implies⎯H  =  -∇Ψ [Amperes], where Ψ  is 
magnetic potential.  Therefore the magnetic potential difference between two points is:

(4.1.9) 

This definition of magnetic potential is useful in understanding the magnetic circuits discussed in 
Section 4.4.3. 

Often  not  all  source  charges  and  currents  are  given  because  some  reside  on  given 
equipotential  surfaces  and  assume  an  unknown  distribution  consistent  with  that  constraint.    To 
address  this  case,  Maxwell’s  equations  can  be  simply  manipulated  to  form  Laplace’s  equation, 
which can sometimes be solved by separation of variables, as discussed in Section 4.5, or usually 
by numerical methods.   Section 4.6  then discusses  the utility of  flux  tubes and  field mapping  for 
understanding static field distributions. 

Quasistatics assumes  that  the field strengths change so slowly  that  the electric and magnetic 
fields  induced  by  those  changes  (the  contributions  to⎯E  and⎯H  from  the  ∂/∂t  terms  in Faraday’s 
and  Ampere’s  laws)  are  sufficiently  small  that  their  own  induced  fields  (∝(∂/∂t)2)  can  be 
neglected;  only  the  original  and  first-order  induced  fields  are  therefore  of  interest.    Quasistatic 
examples were discussed  in Chapter 3  in  the context of  resistors, capacitors, and  inductors.   The 
mirror  image  technique  described  in  Section  4.2  is  used  for  static,  quasistatic,  and  dynamic 
problems  and  incidentally  in  the  discussion  in  Section  4.3  concerning  exponential  relaxation  of 
field strengths in conducting media and skin depth. 

4.2  Mirror image charges and currents 

One  very  useful  problem  solving  technique  is  to  change  the  problem  definition  to  one  that  is 
easier  to solve but  is known  to have  the same answer.   An excellent example of  this approach  is 
the use of mirror-image charges and currents, which also works for wave problems.10

Consider  the problem of  finding  the  fields produced by  a  charge  located  a distance d  above 
an  infinite  perfectly  conducting  plane,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  4.2.1(a).    Boundary  conditions  at 
the conductor  require only  that  the electric  field  lines be perpendicular  to  its  surface.   Any other 
set of boundary conditions  that  imposes  the same constraint must yield  the same unique solution 
by virtue of the uniqueness theorem of Section 2.8. 

One  such  set  of  equivalent  boundary  conditions  invokes  a  duplicate mirror  image  charge  a 
 
distance 2d away  from  the original charge and of opposite sign;  the conductor  is  removed.    The 
symmetry  for  equal  and  opposite  charges  requires  the  electric  field  lines  E   to  be  perpendicular 
to the original surface of the conductor at z = 0; this results in  E  being exactly as it was for z > 0 
when the conductor was present, as illustrated in Figure 4.2.1(b).  Therefore uniqueness says that 
above the half-plane the fields produced by the original charge plus its mirror image are identical 
to  those  of  the  original  problem.    The  fields  below  the  original  half  plane  are  clearly  different, 
but they are not relevant to the original problem. 

This  equivalence  applies  for  multiple  charges  or  for  a  charge  distribution,  as  illustrated  in 
Figure 4.2.2.  In fact the mirror image method remains valid so long as the charges change value 
or  position  slowly  with  respect  to  the  relaxation  time  ε/σ  of  the  conductor,  as  discussed  in 
Section  4.4.1.  The  relaxation  time  is  the  1/e  time  constant  required  for  the  charges  within  the 
conductor  to  approach  new  equilibrium  positions  after  the  source  charge  distribution  outside 
changes.

Because  the  mirror  image  method  works  for  varying  or  moving  charges,  it  works  for  the 
currents  that  must  be  associated  with  them  by  conservation  of  charge  (2.1.21),  as  suggested  in 
Figure 4.2.3 (a) and (b).  Figure 4.2.3(d) also suggests how the magnetic fields produced by these 
currents  satisfy  the  boundary  conditions  for  the  conducting  plane:  at  the  surface  of  a  perfect 
conductor⎯H is only parallel. 

The mirror  image method continues  to work  if the upper half plane contains a conductor, as 
illustrated  in  Figure  4.2.4;  the  conductor must  be  imaged  too.    These  conductors  can  even  be  at 
angles,  as  suggested  in  Figure  4.2.4(b).    The  region  over  which  the  deduced  fields  are  valid  is 
naturally  restricted  to  the  original  opening  between  the  conductors.    Still  more  complex  image

Relaxation of fields, skin depth 

4.3.1  Relaxation of electric fields and charge in conducting media 

Electric  and  magnetic  fields  established  in  conducting  time-invariant  homogeneous  media  tend 
to  decay  exponentially  unless  maintained.    Under  the  quasistatic  assumption  all  time  variations 
are  sufficiently  slow  that  contributions  to  E   by  B t
 are  negligible,  which  avoids  wave-like
∂ ∂
behavior and simplifies the problem.  This relaxation process is governed by the conservation-of­
charge relation (2.1.21), Gauss’s law  ( • = ) , and Ohm’s law  (
σE ) :

(4.3.1)

Since  an  arbitrary  E   can  be  established  by  initial  conditions,  the  general  solution  to  (4.3.1) 
requires  ( σ + ε∂ ∂ t ) ∇iE = 0 , leading to the differential equation: 

( ∂ ∂  + σ ε  ρ = 0
)	
t

(4.3.2)

where  ∇ • E = ρ ε .  This  has  the  solution  that  ρ ( r )   relaxes  exponentially  with  a  charge 
relaxation time constant τ = ε/σ seconds: 

t  = ρ o( )r e− τ 
t  ⎡⎣m -3
ρ( )r  = ρ o( )r e−σ  ε

 (charge relaxation) 

(4.3.3) 

It  follows  that  an  arbitrary  initial  electric  field  E r( )   in  a  medium  having  uniform  ε  and  σ 
will also decay exponentially with the same time constant ε/σ because Gauss’s law relates  E  and  
ρ linearly: 

∇ • E = ρ ( )t  ε	

(4.3.4) 

where  ∇ • Eo  ≡ ρ o  ε .  Therefore electric field relaxation is characterized by:

(electric field relaxation) 

(4.3.5) 

We  should  expect  such  exponential  decay  because  any  electric  fields  in  a  conductor  will 
generate  currents  and  therefore  dissipate  power  proportional  to  J2  and  E2.  But  the  stored 
electrical  energy  is  also  proportional  to  E2,  and  power  dissipation  is  the  negative  derivative  of 
stored energy.  That is, the energy decays at a rate proportional to its present value, which results 
in exponential decay.  In copper τ = εo/σ ≅ 9×10-12/(5×107) ≅ 2×10-19 seconds, short compared to 
any  delay  of  common  interest.    The  special  case  of  parallel-plate  resistors  and  capacitors  is 
discussed in Section 3.1. 

Example 4.3A 
What are the electric field relaxation time constants τ for sea water (ε ≅ 80εo, σ ≅ 4) and dry soil 
(ε ≅ 2εo, σ ≅ 10-5)?  For what radio frequencies can they be considered good conductors? 

Solution:  	 Equation  (4.3.5)  yields  τ  =  ε/σ ≅  (80×8.8×10-12)/4  ≅  1.8×10-10  seconds  for  seawater, 
and  (2×8.8×10-12)/10-5  ≅ 1.8×10-6 seconds  for dry soil.  So  long as  E  changes slowly 
with  respect  to  τ,  the medium  has  time  to  cancel  E ;  frequencies  below  ~5  GHz  and 
~500  kHz  have  this  property  for  seawater  and  typical  dry  soil,  respectively,  which 
behave  like  good  conductors  at  these  lower  frequencies.    Moist  soil  behaves  like  a 
conductor up to ~5 MHz and higher.

4.3.2  Relaxation of magnetic fields in conducting media 

Magnetic  fields  and  their  induced  currents  similarly  decay  exponentially  in  conducting  media 
unless  they  are  externally  maintained;  this  decay  process  is  often  called  magnetic  diffusion  or 
magnetic  relaxation.  We assume  that  the  time variations are sufficiently slow  that contributions 
to  H  by  D t
∂  are negligible.  In this limit Ampere’s law becomes:

Thus the lifetime of magnetic field distributions in conducting media increases with permeability 
(energy  storage  density),  conductivity  (reducing  dissipation  for  a  given  current),  and  the 
wavelength squared (λ = 2π/k). 

4.3.3 

Induced currents 

Quasistatic  magnetic  fields  induce  electric  fields  by  virtue  of  Faraday’s  law:  × E  =  -μ∂H/  t 
∂  . 
∇
In conductors  these  induced electric fields drive currents  that obey Lenz’s  law: “The direction of 
induced  currents  tends  to  oppose  changes  in  magnetic  flux.” 
Induced  currents  find  wide 
application,  for example,  in: 1) heating, as  in  induction  furnaces  that melt metals, 2) mechanical 
actuation,  as  in  induction  motors  and  impulse  generators,  and  3)  electromagnetic  shielding.    In 
some  cases  these  induced  currents  are  undesirable  and  are  inhibited  by  subdividing  the 
conductors  into elements separated by  thin  insulating barriers.   All  these examples are discussed 
below. 

- 106 -


First  consider  a  simple  conducting hollow  cylinder of  length W driven  circumferentially by 
current Iou(t), as illustrated in Figure 4.3.1, where u(t) is the unit step function (the current is zero 
until  t = 0, when  it becomes  Io).   Centered  in  the outer cylinder  is an  isolated second cylinder of 
conductivity σ and having a thin wall of thickness δ; its length and diameter are W and D << W, 
respectively.

Figure 4.3.1  Relaxation penetration of a magnetic field into a conducting cylinder. 
 

If the inner cylinder were a perfect conductor, then the current Iou(t) would produce an equal 
and  opposite  image  current  ~-Iou(t)  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  inner  cylinder,  thus  producing  a 
net zero magnetic field inside the cylinder formed by that image current.  Consider the integral of 
H d s around  a  closed  contour C1  that  threads both  cylinders  and  circles  zero net  current  at  t = 
• 
0+;  this  integral  yields  zero.  If  the  inner  conductor  were  slightly  resistive,  then  the  same  equal 
and  opposite  current  would  flow  on  the  inner  cylinder,  but  it  would  slowly  dissipate  heat  until 
the  image  current  decayed  to  zero  and  the  magnetic  field  inside  reached  the  maximum  value 
Io/W [A m-1] associated with the outer current Io.  These conclusions are quantified below. 

The magnetic  field H  inside  the  inner  cylinder  depends  on  the  currents  flowing  in  the  outer 
and inner cylinders, Io and I(t), respectively: 

H(t) = u(t)[Io + I(t)]/W 

(4.3.11) 

The  current  I(t)  flowing  in  the  inner  cylinder  is  driven  by  the  voltage  induced  by  H(t)  via 
Faraday’s law (2.4.14): 
E • ds = IR = μ o ∫A ( dH dt ) • da = μ oA dH dt 
(cid:118)∫C2 
where the contour C2 is in the x-y plane and circles the inner cylinder with diameter D.  The area 
circled  by  the  contour  A  =  πD2/4.  The  circumferential  resistance  of  the  inner  cylinder  is  R  = 

(4.3.12) 

- 107 -


πD/σδW  ohms.    For  simplicity  we  assume  that  the  permeability  here  is  μo  everywhere. 
Substituting (4.3.11) into (4.3.12) yields a differential equation for I(t): 

I(t) = - (μoA/WR) dI/dt 

Substituting the general solution I(t) = Ke-t/τ into (4.3.13) yields: 

Ke-t/τ = (μoA/WRτ)Ke-t/τ 

(4.3.13) 

(4.3.14) 

τ = μoA/WR = μoAσδ/πD  [s] 

(magnetic relaxation time) 

(4.3.15) 

Thus the greater the conductivity of the inner cylinder, and the larger its product μA, the longer it 
takes  for  transient magnetic  fields  to  penetrate  it.   For  the  special  case where δ = D/4π  and A = 
D2,  we  find  τ  =  μoσ(D/2π)2,  which  is  the  same  magnetic  relaxation  time  constant  derived  in 
(4.3.10)  if  we  identify  D  with  the  wavelength  λ  of  the  magnetic  field  variations.    Equation 
(4.3.15) is also approximately correct if μo → μ for the inner cylinder. 

Since  H(t)  =  0  at  t  =  0+,  (4.3.11)  yields  I(t  =  0+)  =  -  Io,  and  the  solution  I(t)  =  Ke-t/τ 
becomes: 

I(t) = - Io e-t/τ  [A] 

The magnetic field inside the inner cylinder follows from (4.3.16) and (4.3.11): 

H(t) = u(t)Io (1 - e-t/τ)/W  [A m-1] 

(4.3.16) 

(4.3.17) 

The  geometry  of  Figure  4.3.1  can  be  used  to  heat  resistive  materials  such  as  metals 
electrically by placing the metals in a ceramic container that sinusoidal magnetic fields penetrate 
easily.  The  induced  currents  can  then  melt  the  material  quicker  by  heating  the  material 
throughout  rather  than  just  at  the  surface,  as would  a  flame.   The  frequency  f  generally must  be 
sufficiently low that the magnetic fields penetrate a significant fraction of the container diameter; 
f << 1/τ. 

The  inner  cylinder  of  Figure  4.3.1  can  also  be  used  to  shield  its  interior  from  alternating 
magnetic  fields  by  designing  it  so  that  its  time  constant  τ  is much  greater  than  the  period  of  the 
undesired AC  signal;  large  values  of μσδ  facilitate  this  since  τ = μoAσδ/πD  (4.3.15).  Since we 
can model  a  solid  inner  cylinder  as  a  continuum  of  concentric  thin  conducting  shells,  it  follows 
that the inner shells will begin to see significant magnetic fields only after the surrounding shells 
do, and therefore the time delay experienced increases with depth.  This is consistent with τ ∝ δ. 
The  penetration  of  alternating  fields  into  conducting  surfaces  is  discussed  further  in  Section  9.3 
in terms of the exponential penetration skin depth δ =  2/ωμσ  [m]. 

Two  actuator  configurations  are  suggested  by  Figure  4.3.1.    First,  the  inner  cylinder  could 
be inserted only part way into the outer cylinder.  Then the net force on the inner cylinder would 
expel  it when  the outer  cylinder was  energized because  the polarity of  these  two  electromagnets 

- 108 -


are  reversed,  the  outer  one  powered  by  Io  and  the  inner  one  by    -  Io(1  -  e-t/τ).  Electromagnetic 
forces are discussed more fully  in Chapter 5; here it suffices to note that induced currents can be 
used  to  simplify  electromechanical  actuators.    A  similar  “kick”  can  be  applied  to  a  flat  plate 
placed  across  the  end  of  the  outer  cylinder,  for  again  the  induced  cylindrically  shaped  mirror 
image  current  would  experience  a  transient  repulsive  force.  Mirror-image  currents  were 
discussed in Section 4.2. 

The  inner  cores  in  transformers  and  some  inductors  are  typically  iron  and  are  circled  by 
wires  carrying  alternating  currents,  as  discussed  in  Section  3.2.    The  alternating  currents  induce 
circular currents in the core called eddy currents that dissipate power.  To minimize such induced 
currents  and  losses,  high-μ  conducting  cores  are  commonly  composed  of  many  thin  sheets 
separated  from  each  other  by  thin  coats  of  varnish  or  other  insulator  that  largely  blocks  those 
induced  currents;  these  are  called  laminated  cores.  A  rough  estimate  of  the  effectiveness  of 
using  N  plates  instead  of  one  can  be  obtained  by  noting  that  the  power  Pd  dissipated  in  each 
lamination  is proportional  to V2/R, where  V = (cid:118)∫C
E • ds  is  the  loop voltage  induced by H(t)  and 
R  is  the  effective  resistance  of  that  loop.   By  design H(t)  usually  penetrates  the  full  transformer 
core.  Thus  V  is  roughly  proportional  to  the  area  of  each  lamination  in  the  plane  perpendicular 
to⎯H, which  decreases  as  1/N.  The  resistance R  experienced  by  the  induced  current  circulating 
in  each  lamination  increases  roughly  by  N  since  the  width  of  the  channel  through  which  it  can 
flow  is  reduced  as  N  increases  while  the  length  of  the  channel  changes  only  moderately.    The 
total power dissipated  for N  laminations  is  thus  roughly proportional  to NV2/R ∝ NN-2/N = N-2. 
Therefore  we  need  only  increase  N  to  the  point  where  the  power  loss  is  tolerable  and  the 
penetration of the transformer core by H(t) is nearly complete each period. 

Example 4.3B 
How  long  does  it  take  a magnetic  field  to  penetrate  a  1-mm  thick metal  cylinder  of  diameter D 
with  conductivity 5×107  [S/m]  if μ = μo?   Design  a  shield  for  a ~10-cm  computer  that blocks 1­
MHz magnetic fields emanating from an AM radio. 

Solution:  	 If we assume the geometry of Figure 4.3.1 and use (4.3.15), τ = μoAσδ/πD, we find τ 
= 1.3×10-6×D×5×107×10-3/4 = 0.016D seconds, where A = πD2/4 and δ =  10-3.  If D 
 
= 0.1, then τ = 1.6×10-2 seconds, which is ~105 longer than the rise time ~10-6/2π of a 
1-MHz signal.    If a smaller  ratio of 102  is sufficient,  then a one-micron  thick  layer of 
metal evaporated on thin plastic might suffice.  If the metal had μ = 104μo, then a one-
micron thick layer would provide a safety factor of 106.

Static fields in inhomogeneous materials

Static electric fields in inhomogeneous materials 

Many practical problems  involve  inhomogeneous media where  the boundaries may be abrupt, as 
in  most  capacitors  or  motors,  or  graded,  as  in  many  semiconductor  or  optoelectronic  devices. 
The basic issues are well illustrated by the static cases discussed below.  Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 
discuss  static  electric  and  magnetic  fields,  respectively,  in  inhomogeneous  media.    To  simplify 

- 109 -


the discussion, only media characterized by  real scalar values  for ε, μ, and σ will be considered, 
where all three properties can be a function of position. 

Static  electric  fields  in  all media  are governed by  the  static  forms of Faraday’s  and Gauss’s 
laws: 

∇ × E 0
= 

∇ • D = ρ f 

and by the constitutive relations: 

D = εE = εo E + P 

J = σE 

(4.4.1)

(4.4.2) 

(4.4.3) 

(4.4.4) 

A  few  simple  cases  illustrate  how  these  laws  can  be  used  to  characterize  inhomogeneous 
conductors  and  dielectrics.  Perhaps  the  simplest  case  is  that  of  a  wire  or  other  conducting 
structure  (1)  imbedded  in  a  perfectly  insulating  medium  (2)  having  conductivity  σ  =  0.  Since 
charge  is conserved,  the perpendicular components of current must be  the  same on both  sides of 
the  boundary  so  that  J1⊥  =  J2⊥  =  0  =  E2⊥.  Therefore  all  currents  in  the  conducting  medium  are 
trapped within it and at the surface must flow parallel to that surface. 

Let’s consider next the simple case of an inhomogeneous slab between two parallel perfectly 
conducting plates spaced L apart in the x direction at a potential difference of Vo volts, where the 
terminal  at  x  =  0  has  the  greater  voltage.    Suppose  that  the  medium  has  permittivity  ε,  current 
density Jo, and inhomogeneous conductivity σ(x), where: 

σ = σ o

(4.4.6)

(4.4.7)

Note  from  the  derivative  in  (4.4.7)  that  abrupt  discontinuities  in  conductivity  generally  produce 
free surface charge ρs at  the discontinuity.  Although  inhomogeneous conductors have a net  free 
charge  density  throughout  the  volume,  they may  or may  not  also  have  a  net  polarization  charge

Now  let’s  consider  the  effects  of  inhomogeneous  permittivity  ε(x)  in  an  insulating medium 
(σ = 0) where: 

(4.4.9)

ε = ε o (1 + )

L 
Since the insulating slab should contain no free charge and the boundaries force  D  to be in the x 
direction,  therefore  D   cannot  be  a  function  of  x  because  ∇ • = ρ 
D
f  = 0 .  But  D = ε(x )E(x )  ; 
therefore the x dependence of  E  must cancel that of ε, so:

(4.4.13) 

A  similar  series  of  computations  readily  handles  the  case  where  both  ε  and  σ  are 
inhomogeneous. 

Example 4.4A 
A certain capacitor consists of  two parallel conducting plates, one at z = 0 and +V volts and one 
at  z  =  d  and  zero  volts.    They  are  separated  by  a  dielectric  slab  of  permittivity  ε,  for  which  the 
conductivity  is small and different  in  the  two halves of  the dielectric, each of which  is d/2  thick; 
σ1  =  3σ2.  Assume  the  interface  between  σ1  and  σ2  is  parallel  to  the  capacitor  plates  and  is 

- 111 -

( )
located at z = 0.  What is the free charge density ρf(z) in the dielectric, and what is  E z  where z 
is the coordinate perpendicular to the plates? 

Solution:	 Since  charge  is  conserved,  J1 = J 2  = σ 1E1 = σ 2 E 2 ,  so  E 2  = σ1E1  σ2  = 3E 1 .  But 
(E1+E2)d/2  =  V,  so  4E  d  2   =  V,  and  E1  =  V/2d.  The  surface  charge  on  the  lower

[C/m2],  and  ρs  on  the  upper  plate  is
ρs z( =0 ) = Dz 0   = εE1 = ε V
 
2d
 
plate  is 
= 
−Dz d =  −εE2  = −ε 3V
2d
 
 
.  The  free  charge  at  the  dielectric  interface  is ρs  (z  =  d/2)  = 
= 
D2  - D1 = ε(E2  - E1) = εV/d.  Charge can accumulate at all  three surfaces because  the 
dielectric  conducts.  The  net  charge  is  zero.    The  electric  field  between  capacitor 
plates was discussed in Section 3.1.2. 

4.4.2 

Static magnetic fields in inhomogeneous materials 

Static magnetic  fields  in most media  are  governed  by  the  static  forms  of Ampere’s  and Gauss’s 
laws: 

∇ × H 0	
= 

∇ • B 0	
= 

and by the constitutive relations: 

B = μH = μo ( H + M )	

(4.4.14)

(4.4.15)

(4.4.16) 

One simple case  illustrates how  these  laws characterize  inhomogeneous magnetic materials. 
Consider a magnetic material  that  is characterized by μ(x) and has an  imposed magnetic  field⎯B 
in the x direction.  Since  ∇ • B 0  it follows that  B  is constant  (
Bo )
throughout, and that⎯H is a 
=
function of x: 

H =  Bo	
μ(x )  

(4.4.17)

As  a  result,  higher-permeability  regions  of  magnetic  materials  generally  host  weaker  magnetic 
fields  H ,  as  shown  in  Section  3.2.2  for  the  toroidal  inductors  with  gaps.    In  many  magnetic 
devices μ might vary four to six orders of magnitude, as would  H .

magnetic  circuits  that  guide⎯B  and  control  the  spatial  form  of  the  static  curl-free  magnetic 
potential  Ψ ( )r . 

Faraday’s law says that static electric fields⎯E are curl-free: 

∇ × E = − ∂B  = 0  
∂t 

(Faraday’s law) 

(4.4.18)

Since ∇ ×⎯E = 0 in static cases, it follows that: 

⎯E = -∇Φ 

(4.4.19) 

where Φ is the electric potential [volts] as a function of position  in space.  But Gauss’s  law says 
∇iE = ρ/ε  in regions where ρ is constant.  Therefore ∇ •⎯E = -∇2Φ = ρ/ε and: 

ρ
2 
∇ Φ = − 
ε

 

(Laplace’s equation) 

(4.4.20)

In  static  current-free  regions  of  space  with  constant  permeability  μ,  Ampere’s  law  (2.1.6) 
says: 

∇ ×⎯H = 0 

and therefore⎯H,  like⎯E, can be related to a scalar magnetic potential [Amperes] Ψ: 

⎯H = -∇Ψ 

(4.4.21) 

(4.4.22) 

Since ∇ •⎯H = 0 when μ is independent of position, it follows that ∇•(-∇Ψ) = ∇2Ψ and: 

2∇ Ψ  = 0  

(Laplace’s equation for magnetic potential) 

(4.4.23) 


The  perfect  parallel  between  Laplace’s  equations  (4.4.20)  and  (4.4.23)  for  electric  and

magnetic  fields  in  charge-free  regions  offers  a  parallel  between  current  density⎯J  =  σ E   [A/m2] 

and magnetic flux density⎯B = μ H , and also between conductivity σ and permeability μ as they  

relate to gradients of electric and magnetic potential, respectively: 

∇2Φ = 0 

⎯E = -∇Φ 

∇2Ψ = 0 

⎯H = -∇Ψ 

⎯J = σ E  = - σ∇Φ 

⎯B = μ H  = - μ∇Ψ 

(4.4.24) 

(4.4.25) 

(4.4.26) 

Just as current is confined to flow within wires imbedded in insulating media having σ ≅ 0, so is 
magnetic  flux⎯B  trapped within  high-permeability materials  imbedded  in  very  low  permeability 

- 113 -


media,  as  suggested  by  the  discussion  in  Section  3.2.2  of  how  magnetic  fields  are  confined 
within high-permeability toroids. 

The  boundary  condition  (2.6.5)  that⎯B⊥  is  continuous  requires  that⎯B⊥ ≅  0  at  boundaries 
with  media  having  μ ≅  0;  thus  essentially  all  magnetic  flux⎯B  is  confined  within  permeable 
magnetic media having μ >> 0.

Two  parallel  examples  that  help  clarify  the  issues  are  illustrated  in  Figure  4.4.1.    In  Figure 
4.4.1(a)  a  battery  connected  to  perfect  conductors  apply  the  same  voltage  Φo  across  two 
conductors  in  parallel;  Ai,  σi,  di,  and  Ii  are  respectively  their  cross-sectional  area,  conductivity, 
length, and current flow for i = 1,2.  The current through each conductor is given by (4.4.26) and: 

Ii = JiAi = σι∇ΦiA = σιΦoAi/di = Φo/Ri 

where: 

Ri = di/σiAi  [ohms] 

is the resistance of conductor i, and I = V/R is Ohm’s law. 

(4.4.27) 

(4.4.28) 

For  the magnetic  circuit  of  Figure  4.4.1(b)  a  parallel  set  of  relations  is  obtained, where  the 
 
total magnetic  flux Λ = BA  [Webers]  through a cross-section of area A  is analogous  to current  I 
= JA.  The magnetic flux Λ through each magnetic branch is given by (4.4.26) so that: 

Λ i = BiAi = μι∇ΨiAi = μιΨoAi/di = Ψo/Ri 

where: 

Ri = di/μiA 

(4.4.29) 

(4.4.30) 

is the magnetic reluctance of branch i, analogous to the resistance of a conductive branch. 

Because  of  the  parallel  between  current  I  and  magnetic  flux  Λ,  they  divide  similarly 
between alternative parallel paths.  That is, the total current is: 

Io = I1 + I2 = Φ0(R1 + R2)/R1R2 

(4.4.31) 

- 114 -


The value of Φo found from (4.4.31) leads directly to the current-divider equation: 

I1 = Φo/R1 = IoR2/(R1 + R2) 

(4.4.32) 

So,  if R2  = ∞,  all  Io  flows  through R1; R2  =  0  implies  no  current  flows  through R1;  and R2  = R1 
implies half flows through each branch.  The corresponding equations for total magnetic flux and 
flux division in magnetic circuits are: 

Λo = Λ1 + Λ2 = Ψ0(R1 + R2)/R1R2 

Λ1 = Ψo/R1 = ΛoR2/(R1 + R2) 

(4.4.33) 

(4.4.34) 

Although  the  conductivity  of  insulators  surrounding  wires  is  generally  over  ten  orders  of 
magnitude  smaller  than  that  of  the  wires,  the  same  is  not  true  for  the  permeability  surrounding 
high-μ materials,  so  there  generally  is  some  small  amount  of  flux  leakage  from  such media;  the 
trapping  is  not  perfect.    In  this  case⎯H  outside  the  high-μ material  is  nearly  perpendicular  to  its 
surface, as shown in (2.6.13). 

Example 4.4B 
The magnetic circuit of Figure 4.4.1(b) is driven by a wire that carries 3 amperes and is wrapped 
50 times around the leftmost vertical member in a clockwise direction as seen from the top.  That 
member  has  infinite  permeability  (μ  = ∞),  as  do  the  top  and  bottom members.    If  the  rightmost 
member is missing, what is the magnetic field⎯H in the vertical member R1, for which the length 
is d and μ >> μo?   If both R1 and R2 are  in place and  identical, what  then are⎯H1 and⎯H2?  If R2 
is  removed  and  R1  consists  of  two  long  thin  bars  in  series  having  lengths  da  and  db,  cross-
sectional areas Aa and Ab, and permeabilities μa and μb, respectively, what then are⎯Ha and⎯Hb? 
Solution:  For  this  static  problem Ampere’s  law  (4.1.2)  becomes  (cid:118)∫C
H • d s  =  (cid:119)∫∫ A
J  • n da = N  I
ˆ 
= 50×3 =150  [A] = Hd.  Therefore⎯H =  zˆ 150/d  [A m-1], where  zˆ  and⎯H are upward 
due  to  the  right-hand  rule  associated  with  Ampere’s  law.    If  R2  is  added,  both  the 
integrals of⎯H through the two branches must still equal NI, so⎯H remains  zˆ 150/d [A 
m-1]  in both branches.  For  the  series case  the  integral of⎯H yields Hada + Hbdb = NI. 
Because the magnetic flux is trapped within this branch, it is constant: μaHaAa = BaAa 
=  BbAb  =  μbHbAb.  Therefore  Hb  =  Ha(μaAa/μbAb)  and  Ha[da  +  db(μaAa/μbAb)]  =  NI, 
so⎯Ha =  zˆ NI/[da + db(μaAa/μbAb)] [A m-1].

Laplace’s equation and separation of variables  

4.5.1  Laplace’s equation 

Electric  and  magnetic  fields  obey  Faraday’s  and  Ampere’s  laws,  respectively,  and  when  the 
fields are static and the charge and current are zero we have: 

- 115 -

∇ × E 0	
= 

∇ × H 0
= 

(4.5.1)

(4.5.2)

These equations are satisfied by any  E  or  H  that can be expressed as the gradient of a potential: 

E = −∇Φ 

H = −∇Ψ 

(4.5.3) 

(4.5.4) 

Therefore  Maxwell’s  equations  for  static  charge-free  regions  of  space  are  satisfied  for  any 
arbitrary differentiable potential  function  Φ ( r )  or  Ψ ( r ) , which  can be determined  as discussed 
below. 

Any  potential  function  must  be  consistent  with  the  given  boundary  conditions,  and  with 
Gauss’s laws in static charge- and current-free spaces: 

∇ • D 0
= 

∇ • B 0
= 

(4.5.5)

(4.5.6)

where  D = εE   and  B = μH .  Substituting  (4.5.3)  into  (4.5.5),  and  (4.5.4)  into  (4.5.6)  yields 
Laplace’s equation: 

2

∇ Φ = ∇  Ψ = 0	  

(Laplace’s equation) 

(4.5.7) 

To  find  static  electric  or  magnetic  fields  produced  by  any  given  set  of  boundary  conditions  we 
need  only  to  solve  Laplace’s  equation  (4.5.7)  for  Φ  or  Ψ,  and  then  use  (4.5.3)  or  (4.5.4)  to 
compute  the gradient of  the potential.   One approach  to  solving Laplace’s equation  is developed 
in the following section. 

Example 4.5A 
Does the potential Φ = 1/r satisfy Laplace’s equation ∇2Φ = 0, where r = (x2 + y2 + z2)0.5? 

Solution:	 ∇2 = ∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 + ∂2/∂z2.  First: (∂/∂x) (x2 + y2 + z2)-0.5 = -0.5(x2 + y2 + z2)-1.5(2x), 
so  (∂2/∂x2)  (x2 + y2 + z2)-0.5 = 0.75(x2 + y2 + z2)-2.5(2x)2  -  (x2 + y2 + z2)-1.5 .  Therefore 
(∂2/∂x2 + ∂2/∂y2 + ∂2/∂z2)(x2 + y2 + z2)-0.5 = 3(x2 + y2 + z2)-2.5(x2 + y2 + z2) - 3(x2 + y2 
+  z2)-1.5  =  0.  So  this  potential  satisfies  Laplace’s  equation.    The  algebra  could  have 
been  simplified  if  instead  we  wrote  ∇2  in  spherical  coordinates  (see  Appendix  C), 
because only the radial term is potentially non-zero for Φ = 1/r: ∇2 = r -2(∂/∂r)(r2∂/∂r). 
In  this case  the right-most factor  is r2∂r  -1/∂r =  r2(-r  -2) =  -1, and ∂(-1)/∂r = 0, so again 
∇2Φ = 0.

4.5.2 

Separation of variables 

We can find simple analytic solutions to Laplace’s equation only in a few special cases for which 
the  solutions  can  be  factored  into  products,  each  of  which  is  dependent  only  upon  a  single 
dimension  in  some  coordinate  system  compatible  with  the  geometry  of  the  given  boundaries. 
This process of separating Laplace’s equation and solutions into uni-dimensional factors is called 
separation  of  variables.  It  is most  easily  illustrated  in  terms  of  two  dimensions.    Let’s  assume 
the solution can be factored: 

Φ(x,y) = X(x)Y(y) 

Then Laplace’s equation becomes: 

(4.5.8) 

∇  Φ = ∂  Φ ∂ x  + ∂  Φ ∂ y  = Y( y) d  X  dx  + X(x ) d  Y  dy 2  = 0 
2

(4.5.9) 

Dividing by X(x)Y(y) yields: 

⎡d   X (x )   dx  2 ⎤⎦  X (x )  = − ⎡⎣d   Y ( y)   dy  2 ⎤⎦  Y ( y)  
2
2 
⎣ 

(4.5.10)

Since  (4.5.10) must be  true  for all values of x, y,  it  follows  that each  term must equal a constant 
k2, called the separation constant, so that: 

2 
2
2 
d X dx  = −k X  

2 
2
2
d Y dy  = k  Y  

Generic solutions to (4.5.11) are, for k ≠ 0: 

X(x) = A cos kx + B sin kx 

Y(y) = C cosh ky + D sinh ky 

An equivalent alternative is Y(y) = C' eky + D' e-ky.  Generic solutions when k = 0 are: 

X(x) = Ax + B 

Y(y) = Cy + D 

(4.5.11) 

(4.5.12) 

(4.5.13) 

(4.5.14) 

(4.5.15) 

Note that by letting k → jk, the sinusoidal x-dependence becomes hyperbolic, and the hyperbolic 
y  dependence  becomes  sinusoidal--the  roles  of  x  and  y  are  reversed.    Whether  k  is  zero,  real, 
imaginary,  or  complex  depends  upon  boundary  conditions.   Linear  combinations  of  solutions  to 
differential equations are also solutions to those same equations, and such combinations are often 
required to match boundary conditions. 

- 117 -


These  univariable  solutions  can  be  combined  to  yield  the  three  solution  forms  for  x-y 
coordinates: 

Φ(x,y) = (A + Bx)(C + Dy) 

Φ(x,y) = (A cos kx + B sin kx)(C cosh ky + D sinh ky) 

for k = 0 

(4.5.16) 

for k2 > 0 

(4.5.17) 

Φ(x,y) = (A cosh qx + B sinh qx)(C cos qy + D sin qy) 

for k2 < 0 (k = jq) 

(4.5.18) 

This  approach  can  be  extended  to  three  cartesian  dimensions  by  letting  Φ(x,y,z)  = 
X(x)Y(y)Z(z); this leads to the solution11: 

Φ(x,y,z) =  (A cos kxx + B sin kxx)(C cos kyy + D sin kyy)(E cosh kzz + F sinh kzz)  (4.5.19)

Consider an  infinitely  long slot of width w and depth d cut  into a perfectly conducting slab, 
and  suppose  the  cover  to  the  slot  has  the  voltage  distribution  V(x)  =  5  sin(πx/w)  volts,  as 
illustrated  in  Figure  4.5.1(a).    This  is  a  two-dimensional  cartesian-coordinate  problem,  so  the 
solution (4.5.17) is appropriate, where we must ensure this expression yields potentials that have 
the  given  voltage  across  the  top  of  the  slot  and  zero  potential  over  the  side  and  bottom 
boundaries of the slot.  Thus: 

Φ ( x , y ) = A sin ( πx w ) sinh ( πy w )

(4.5.20) 

where  the sine and sinh options12  from  (4.5.17) were chosen  to match  the given potentials on all

four  boundaries,  and  where  A 5

Figure 4.5.1(b) illustrates the solution for the case where the potential across the open top of 
the slot is given as V(x) = sin 2πx/w.  If an arbitrary voltage V(x) is applied across the opening at 
the top of the slot, then a sum of sine waves can be used to match the boundary conditions. 

Although  all  of  these  examples  were  in  terms  of  static  electric  fields  E   and  potentials  Φ, 
they  equally  well  could  have  been  posed  in  terms  of  static  H   and  magnetic  potential  Ψ;  the 
forms of solutions for Ψ are identical.

Solution:	 Separation  of  variables  permits  linear  gradients  in  potentials  in  rectangular 
coordinates  via  (4.5.14)  and  (4.5.15),  so  the  potential  can  have  the  form 
Φ  =  (Ax  + B)(Cy  + D) where B  = D  =  0  for  this  example.   Boundary  conditions  are 
matched for Φ(x,y) = (V/L2)xy [V].  It follows that:   E = −∇Φ = ( V L

Separation of variables in cylindrical and spherical coordinates 

Laplace’s  equation  can  be  separated  only  in  four  known  coordinate  systems:  cartesian, 
cylindrical,  spherical,  and  elliptical.    Section  4.5.2  explored  separation  in  cartesian  coordinates, 
together with an example of how boundary conditions could  then be applied  to determine a  total 
solution  for  the  potential  and  therefore  for  the  fields.   The  same  procedure  can  be  used  in  a  few 
other coordinate systems, as illustrated below for cylindrical and spherical coordinates. 

12  sinh  x  = ( e x  − e − x ) 2  and  cosh  x  = ( e x  + e − x ) 2 .

When  there  is  no  dependence  on  the  z  coordinate,  Laplace’s  equation  in  cylindrical 
coordinates reduces to circular coordinates and is:

Appendix  C  reviews  the  del  operator  in  several  coordinate  systems.    We  again  assume  the 
solution can be separated: 

Φ = R ( r )  Φ φ (   )  

Substitution of (4.5.22) into (4.5.21) and dividing by R(r)Φ(φ) yields:

where m2 is the separation constant. 

(4.5.22) 

(4.5.23) 

The solution to (4.5.23) depends on whether m2 is zero, positive, or negative: 

Φ(r,φ) = [A + Bφ][C + D (ln r)] 

Φ(r,φ) =(A sin mφ + B cos mφ)(Crm + Dr-m) 

(for m2 = 0) 

(4.5.24) 

(for m2 > 0) 

(4.5.25) 

Φ(r,φ) = [A sinh pφ + B cosh pφ][C cos(p ln r) + D sin(p ln r)] 

(for m2 < 0) 

(4.5.26) 

where A, B, C, and  D are constants to be determined and m ≡ jp for m2 < 0. 

A  few  examples  of  boundary  conditions  and  the  resulting  solutions  follow.    The  simplest 
case  is  a  uniform  field  in  the  + xˆ   direction;  the  solution  that matches  these  boundary  conditions 
is (4.5.25) for m = 1: 

Φ(r,φ) = Br cos φ 

(4.5.27) 

Another  simple example  is  that of a conducting cylinder of  radius R and potential V.   Then 
the  potential  inside  the  cylinder  is V  and  that  outside  decays  as  ln  r,  as  given  by  (1.3.12), when 
m = C = 0: 

Φ ( r , φ ) = ( V  ln  R   ln  r  
) 

The electric field associated with this electric potential is: 

r = rˆ ( V
E = −∇Φ = −  ∂Φ ∂

) r −1 

 

 

(4.5.28)

(4.5.29)

Thus  E  is radially directed away from the conducting cylinder if V is positive, and decays as r-1. 

- 120 -


A  final  interesting  example  is  that  of  a  dielectric  cylinder  perpendicular  to  an  applied 
electric field  E xE=  ˆ  o .  Outside the cylinder the potential follows from (4.5.25) for m = 1 and is: 

Φ ( r , φ ) = − E  r cos φ + ( AR  r ) cos φ 
o 

The potential inside can have no singularity at the origin and is: 

Φ ( r , φ ) = − Eo ( Br  R  ) cos  φ 

(4.5.30)

(4.5.31) 

which corresponds  to a uniform electric field.   The unknown constants A and B can be found by 
matching  the  boundary  conditions  at  the  surface  of  the  dielectric  cylinder, where  both Φ  and⎯D 
must  be  continuous  across  the  boundary  between  regions  1  and  2.  The  two  linear  equations  for 
continuity  (Φ1  = Φ2,  and⎯D1  =⎯D2)  can  be  solved  for  the  two  unknowns A  and B.    The  electric 
fields for this case are sketched in Figure 4.5.2.

If  these cylindrical boundary conditions also vary with z,  the solution  to Laplace’s equation 
becomes: 

Φ(r,φ,z) = Φo[C1ekz + C2e-kz][C3 cos nφ + C4 sin nφ][C5Jn(kr) + C6Nn(kr)] 

(4.5.32) 

where Jn and Nn are Bessel functions of order n of  the first and second kind, respectively, and Ci 
are  dimensionless  constants  that  match  the  boundary  conditions.    The  rapidly  growing 
complexity of  these solutions as  the dimensionality of  the problem  increases generally mandates 
numerical solutions of such boundary value problems in practical cases. 

Our final example involves spherical coordinates, for which the solutions are:

m  are  associated Legendre  functions  of  the  first  and  second  kind,  respectively, 
where  Pn
and  Ci  are  again  dimensionless  constants  chosen  to  match  boundary  conditions.    Certain 
spherical problems do not invoke Legendre functions, however, as illustrated below. 

A dielectric sphere inserted in a uniform electric field  xˆ Eo exhibits the same general form of 
solution as does the dielectric rod perpendicular to a uniform applied electric field; the solution is 
the sum of the applied field and the dipole field produced by the induced polarization charges on 
the  surface  of  the  rod  or  sphere.    Inside  the  sphere  the  field  is  uniform,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
4.5.2.  Polarization charges are discussed more fully in Section 2.5.3.  The potential follows from 
(4.5.33) with n = 1 and m = 0, and is simply:

where  C2  =  0  inside,  and  for  the  region  outside  the  cylinder  C2  is  proportional  to  the  induced 
electric dipole.  C1 outside is unity and inside diminishes below unity as ε increases. 

If  the  sphere  in  the  uniform  electric  field  is  conducting,  then  in  (4.5.34) C1  = C2  =  0  inside 
the sphere, and the field there is zero; the surface charge is:

(4.5.35)

Outside the conducting sphere C1 = 1, and to ensure Φ(r = R) = 0, C2 must also be unity. 

The  same  considerations  also  apply  to  magnetic  potentials.    For  example,  a  sphere  of 
permeability  μ  and  radius  R  placed  in  a  uniform  magnetic  field  would  also  have  an  induced 
magnetic  dipole  that  produces  a  uniform  magnetic  field  inside,  and  produces  outside  the 
superposition  of  the  original  uniform  field with  a magnetic  dipole  field  produced  by  the  sphere. 
A closely related example involves a sphere of radius R having surface current: 

Js  =φˆ sin θ  ⎡⎣  Am −1 ⎤⎦ 

(4.5.36) 

This can be produced approximately by a coil wound on the surface of the sphere with a constant 
number of turns per unit length along the z axis. 

For  a  permeable  sphere  in  a  uniform  magnetic  field  H = − zˆH o ,  the  solution  to  Laplace’s 
equation for magnetic potential ∇2Ψ = 0 has a form similar to (4.5.34): 

Ψ ( r ,  θ ) = Cr cos  θ 

(inside the sphere; r < R) 

(4.5.37) 

Ψ ( r ,  θ ) = Cr  −2 cos  θ + H   r  cos  θ

Flux tubes and field mapping 

4.6.1 

Static field flux tubes 

Flux  tubes  are  arbitrarily  designated  bundles  of  static  electric  or magnetic  field  lines  in  charge-
free regions, as illustrated in Figure 4.6.1.

The  divergence  of  such  static  fields  is  zero  by  virtue  of  Gauss’s  laws,  and  their  curl  is  zero  by 
virtue  of  Faraday’s  and  Ampere’s  laws.    The  integral  forms  of  Gauss’s  laws,  (2.4.17)  and 
(2.4.18), say that the total electric displacement  D  or magnetic flux  B  crossing the surface A of 
a volume V must be zero in a charge-free region:

Therefore  if  the walls  of  flux  tubes  are  parallel  to  the  fields  then  the walls  contribute  nothing  to

(A1) must equal that exiting through the area A2 at the other end, as illustrated:

Consider  two  surfaces  with  potential  differences  between  them,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
4.6.1.  A  representative  flux  tube  is  shown  and  all  other  fields  are  omitted  from  the  figure.   The 
field  lines could correspond  to either  D  or  B .  Constant  ε and μ are not  required  for  D  and  B 
flux  tubes  because  D   and  B   already  incorporate  the  effects  of  inhomogeneous  media.    If  the 
permittivity  ε  and  permeability  μ  were  constant  then  the  figure  could  also  apply  to  E   or   H , 
respectively. 

4.6.2 

Field mapping 

E   and  H   are  gradients  of  the  potentials  Φ  and  Ψ,  respectively  [see  (4.6.2)  and  (4.6.5)],  and 
therefore  the  equipotential  surfaces  are  perpendicular  to  their  corresponding  fields,  as  suggested 
in Figure 4.6.1.  This orthogonality leads to a useful technique called field mapping for sketching 
approximately  correct  field  distributions  given  arbitrarily  shaped  surfaces  at  known  potentials. 
The method  is particularly simple  for “two-dimensional” geometries  that depend only on  the x,y 
coordinates  and  are  independent  of  z,  such  as  the  pair  of  circular  surfaces  illustrated  in  Figure 
4.6.2(a) and the pair of ovals in Figure 4.6.2(b).  Assume that the potential of the inner surface is 
Φ1 or Ψ1, and that at the outer surface is Φ2 or Ψ2.

equipotentials 

Because:  1)  the  lateral  spacing  between  adjacent  equipotential  surfaces  and  (in  two-
dimensional geometries) between adjacent  field  lines are both  inversely proportional  to  the  local 
field strength, and 2) the equipotentials and field lines are mutually orthogonal, it follows that the 
rectangular  shape  of  the  cells  formed  by  these  adjacent  lines  is  preserved  over  the  field  even  as 
the field strengths and cell sizes vary.  That is, the curvilinear square illustrated in Figure 4.6.2(a) 
has approximately  the same shape  (but not size) as all other cells  in  the figure, and approaches a 
perfect  square  as  the  cells  are  subdivided  indefinitely.    If  sketched  perfectly,  any  two­

- 124 -


dimensional  static  potential  distribution  can  be  subdivided  indefinitely  into  such  curvilinear 
square cells. 

One  algorithm  for  performing  such  a  subdivision  is  to  begin  by  sketching  a  first-guess 
equipotential  surface  that:  1)  separates  the  two  (or  more)  equipotential  boundaries  and  2)  is 
orthogonal  to  the  first-guess  field  lines,  which  also  can  be  sketched.    These  field  lines  must  be 
othogonal  to  the  equipotential  boundaries.  For  example,  this  first  sketched  surface  might  have 
potential  (Φ1  +  Φ2)/2,  where  Φ1  and  Φ2  are  the  applied  potentials.    The  spacing  between  the 
initially  sketched  field  lines  and  between  the  initial  equipotential  surfaces  should  form 
approximate  curvilinear  squares.    Each  such  square  can  then  be  subdivided  into  four  smaller 
curvilinear  squares  using  the  same  algorithm.    If  the  initial  guesses  were  correct,  then  the 
curvilinear  squares  approach  true  squares  when  infinitely  subdivided.    If  they  do  not,  the  first 
guess  is  revised  appropriately  and  the  process  can  be  repeated  until  the  desired  insight  or 
perfection is achieved.  In general there will be some fractional squares arranged along one of the 
field lines, but these become negligible in the limit. 

Figure  4.6.2(a)  illustrates  how  the  flux  tubes  in  a  co-axial  geometry  are  radial  with  field 
strength  inversely  proportional  to  radius.  Therefore,  when  designing  systems  limited  by  the 
maximum  allowable  field  strength,  one  avoids  incorporating  surfaces  with  small  radii  of 
curvature  or  sharp  points.  Figure  4.6.2(b)  illustrates  how  the  method  can  be  adapted  to 
arbitrarily  shaped  boundaries,  albeit  with  more  difficulty.    Computer-based  algorithms  using 
relaxation  techniques can  implement such strategies  rapidly  for both  two-dimensional and  three-
dimensional  geometries.    In  three  dimensions,  however,  the  spacing  between  field  lines  varies 
inversely with the square root of their strength, and so the height-to-width ratio of the curvilinear 
3-dimensional  rectangles  formed  by  the  field  lines  and  potentials  is  not  preserved  across  the 
structure.

Chapter 5:  Electromagnetic Forces 

5.1 

Forces on free charges and currents 

5.1.1  Lorentz force equation and introduction to force 

The  Lorentz  force  equation  (1.2.1)  fully  characterizes  electromagnetic  forces  on  stationary  and 
moving charges.  Despite the simplicity of this equation, it is highly accurate and essential to the 
understanding  of  all  electrical  phenomena  because  these  phenomena  are  observable  only  as  a 
result  of  forces  on  charges.  Sometimes  these  forces  drive  motors  or  other  actuators,  and 
sometimes  they  drive  electrons  through  materials  that  are  heated,  illuminated,  or  undergoing 
other  physical  or  chemical  changes.    These  forces  also  drive  the  currents  essential  to  all 
electronic circuits and devices. 

When  the electromagnetic fields and  the  location and motion of free charges are known,  the 
calculation  of  the  forces  acting  on  those  charges  is  straightforward  and  is  explained  in  Sections 
5.1.2  and  5.1.3.  When  these  charges  and  currents  are  confined  within  conductors  instead  of 
being isolated in vacuum, the approaches introduced in Section 5.2 can usually be used.  Finally, 
when  the  charges  and  charge  motion  of  interest  are  bound  within  stationary  atoms  or  spinning 
charged  particles,  the Kelvin  force  density  expressions  developed  in Section  5.3 must  be  added. 
The problem usually lies beyond the scope of this text when the force-producing electromagnetic 
fields  are  not  given  but  are  determined  by  those  same  charges  on  which  the  forces  are  acting 
(e.g., plasma physics), and when the velocities are relativistic. 

The  simplest  case  involves  the  forces  arising  from  known  electromagnetic  fields  acting  on 
free charges in vacuum.  This case can be treated using the Lorentz force equation (5.1.1) for the 
force vector  f  acting on a charge q [Coulombs]:

(5.1.1) 

where  E  and  H  are the local electric and magnetic fields and  v  is the charge velocity vector 
[m s-1]. 

5.1.2  Electric Lorentz forces on free electrons 

The  cathode-ray  tube  (CRT)  used  for  displays  in  older  computers  and  television  sets,  as 
illustrated in Figure 5.1.1, provides a simple example of the Lorentz force law (5.1.1).  Electrons 
thermally  excited  by  a  heated  cathode  at  -V  volts  escape  at  low  energy  and  are  accelerated  in 
vacuum  at  acceleration  a   [m  s-2]  toward  the  grounded  anode  by  the  electric  field  E ≅ − zˆV
s
between  anode  and  cathode13;  V  and  s  are  the  voltage  across  the  tube  and  the  cathode-anode 

 

 

13 The anode  is grounded  for  safety  reasons;  it  lies at  the  tube  face where users may place  their  fingers on  the other 
side of the glass faceplate.  Also, the cathode and anode are sometimes shaped so that the electric field  E , the force 
f  , and the acceleration  a  are functions of z instead of being constant; i.e.,  E  ≠ − zˆV
.

respectively. 

The increase wk in the kinetic energy of the electron equals the accumulated work done on it 
by the electric field  E .  That is, the increase in the kinetic energy of the electron is the product of 
the constant force f acting on it and the distance s the electron moved in the direction of  f  while 
experiencing that force.  If s is the separation between anode and cathode, then:

Typical  values  for  V  in  television  CRT’s  are  generally  less  than  50  kV  so  as  to  minimize  
dangerous  x-rays  produced  when  the  electrons  impact  the  phosphors  on  the  CRT  faceplate, 
which is often made of x-ray-absorbing leaded glass. 

Figure 5.1.1 also illustrates how time-varying lateral electric fields  E ( t ) can be applied by
⊥
deflection plates so as  to scan  the electron beam across  the CRT faceplate and “paint”  the  image 
to be displayed.  At higher  tube voltages V  the electrons move so quickly that the lateral electric 
forces  have  no  time  to  act,  and  magnetic  deflection  is  used  instead  because  lateral  magnetic 
forces increase with electron velocity v. 

Example 5.1A 
Long  interplanetary or  interstellar voyages might eject charged particles at high speeds  to obtain 
thrust.   What  particles  are  most  efficient  at  imparting  total  momentum  if  the  rocket  has  only  E 
joules and M kg available to expend for this purpose? 

Solution:	 Particles  of  charge  e  accelerating  through  an  electric  potential  of  V  volts  acquire 
energy  eV  [J]  =  mv2/2;  such  energies  can  exceed  those  available  in  chemical 
reactions.  The  total  increase  in  rocket  momentum  =  nmv  [N],  where  n  is  the  total 
number  of  particles  ejected,  m  is  the  mass  of  each  particle,  and  v  is  their  velocity. 
The total mass and energy available on the rocket is M = nm and E = neV.  Since v = 
(2eV/m)0.5, the total momentum ejected is Mv = nmv = (n22eVm)0.5 = (2EM)0.5.  Thus 
any kind of charged particles can be ejected, only the total energy E and mass ejected 
M matter. 

5.1.3  Magnetic Lorentz forces on free charges 

An  alternate  method  for  laterally  scanning  the  electron  beam  in  a  CRT  utilizes  magnetic 
deflection  applied  by  coils  that  produce  a magnetic  field  perpendicular  to  the  electron  beam,  as 
illustrated  in  Figure  5.1.2.    The  magnetic  Lorentz  force  on  the  charge  q  =  -e  (1.6021×10-19 
Coulombs) is easily found from (5.1.1) to be: 

f  = −ev

 × μ o H 

[ N ]	

(5.1.8) 

Thus the illustrated CRT electron beam would be deflected upwards, where the magnetic field⎯H 
produced  by  the  coil  is  directed  out  of  the  paper;  the magnitude  of  the  force  on  each  electron  is 
evμoH [N].

The  lateral  force  on  the  electrons  evμoH  can  be  related  to  the  CRT  voltage  V.    Electrons 
accelerated from rest through a potential difference of V volts have kinetic energy eV [J], where: 

eV = mv2  2 

(5.1.9) 

Therefore  the  electron  velocity  v  =  (2eV/m)0.5,  where  m  is  the  electron  mass  (9.107×10-31  kg), 
and  the  lateral  deflection  increases  with  tube  voltage  V,  whereas  it  decreases  if  electrostatic 
deflection is used instead. 

Another  case  of  magnetic  deflection  is  illustrated  in  Figure  5.1.3  where  a  free  electron 
moving  perpendicular  to  a  magnetic  field  B   experiences  a  force  f   orthogonal  to  its  velocity 
vector  v , since  f

which is independent of v and the electron energy, provided the electron is not relativistic.  Thus 
the  magnitudes  of  magnetic  fields  can  be  measured  by  observing  the  radiation  frequency  ωe  of 
free electrons in the region of interest. 

Example 5.1B 
What  is  the  radius  re  of  cyclotron  motion  for  a  100  e.v.  free  electron  in  the  terrestrial 
magnetosphere14  where  B  ≅ 10-6  Tesla?  What  is  the  radius  rp  for  a  free  proton  with  the  same 
energy?  The masses of electrons and protons are ~9.1×10-31 and 1.7×10-27 kg, respectively. 

Solution:  	 The magnetic force on a charged particle is qvμoH = ma = mv2/r, where the velocity v 
follows  from  (5.1.9):    eV  =  mv2/2  ⇒  v  =  (2eV/m)0.5.  Solving  for  re  yields  re  = 
mev/eμoH  =  (2Vm/e)0.5/μoH  ≅ (2×100×9.1×10-31/1.6×10-19)0.5/10-6  ≅ 34  m  for 
electrons and ~2.5 km for protons.

Forces on charges and currents within conductors 

5.2.1  Electric Lorentz forces on charges within conductors 

Static electric forces on charges within conductors can also be calculated using the Lorentz force 
equation  (5.1.1), which  becomes  f
.  For  example,  consider  the  capacitor  plates  illustrated 
qE= 
in  Figure  5.2.1(a),  which  have  total  surface  charges  of  ±Q  coulombs  on  the  two  conductor 
surfaces facing each other.  The fields and charges for capacitor plates were discussed in Section 
3.1.3.

To compute the total attractive electric pressure Pe [N m-2] on the top plate, for example, we can 
integrate  the Lorentz  force density  F   [N m-3] acting on  the charge distribution ρ(z) over depth z 
and unit area:

the cyclotron frequency.

where we have defined  E = zˆE z , as illustrated. 

Care  is  warranted,  however,  because  surface  the  charge  ρ(z)  is  distributed  over  some 
infinitesimal  depth  δ,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.2.1(b),  and  those  charges  at  greater  depths  are 
shielded by the others and therefore see a smaller electric field  E .  If we assume ε = εo inside the 
conductors and a planar geometry with ∂/∂x = ∂/∂y = 0, then Gauss’s law,  ∇ • εE = ρ , becomes: 

εodE z  dz = ρ (z) 

(5.2.3) 

This  expression  for  ρ(z)  can  be  substituted  into  (5.2.2)  to  yield  the  pressure  exerted  by  the 
electric fields on the capacitor plate and perpendicular to it:

The charge density ρ and electric field Ez are zero at  levels below δ, and  the field strength at  the 
surface  is Eo.  If  the  conductor were  a  dielectric with  ε ≠ εo,  then  the Kelvin  polarization  forces 
discussed in Section 5.3.2 would also have to be considered. 

Thus  the  electric  pressure  Pe  [N  m-2]  pulling  on  a  charged  conductor  is  the  same  as  the 
immediately  adjacent  electric  energy  density  [Jm-3],  and  is  independent  of  the  sign  of  ρ  and  E . 
These  dimensions  are  identical  because  [J]  =  [Nm].    The  maximum  achievable  electric  field 
strength  thus  limits  the  maximum  achievable  electric  pressure  Pe,  which  is  negative  because  it 
pulls rather than pushes conductors. 

An alternate form for the electric pressure expression is: 

Pe  = −ε oEo

(5.2.5) 

where ρs is the surface charge density [cm-2] on the conductor and εo is its permittivity; boundary 
conditions  at  the  conductor  require D =  εoE = σs.  Therefore  if  the  conductor were  adjacent  to  a 
dielectric  slab with  ε ≠ εo,  the  electrical  pressure  on  the  conductor would  still  be  determined  by 
the  surface  charge,  electric  field,  and  permittivity  εo within  the  conductor;  the  pressure  does  not 
otherwise depend on ε of adjacent rigid materials. 

We  can  infer  from  (5.2.4)  the  intuitively  useful  result  that  the  average  electric  field  pulling 
on the charge Q is E/2 since the total pulling force f = - PeA, where A is the area of the plate:

(5.2.6)

If  the  two  plates  were  both  charged  the  same  instead  of  oppositely,  the  surface  charges 
would  repel  each  other  and move  to  the  outer  surfaces  of  the  two  plates,  away  from  each  other. 
Since  there  would  now  be  no  E  between  the  plates,  it  could  apply  no  force.    However,  the 
charges  Q  on  the  outside  are  associated  with  the  same  electric  field  strength  as  before,  E  = 
Q/εoA.  These  electric  fields  outside  the  plates  therefore  pull  them  apart  with  the  same  force 
density as before, Pe =  - εoE2/2, and  the force between  the  two plates  is now  repulsive  instead of 
attractive.  In both the attractive and repulsive cases we have assumed the plate width and length 
are sufficiently large compared to the plate separation that fringing fields can be neglected. 

Example 5.2A 
Some  copy machines  leave  the  paper  electrically  charged.   What  is  the  electric  field  E  between 
two  adjacent  sheets of paper  if  they  cling  together  electrically with  a  force density of 0.01 oz. ≅ 
0.0025 N per square centimeter = 25 Nm-2?  If we slightly separate two such sheets of paper by 4 
cm, what is the voltage V between them? 

Solution:	 Electric pressure is Pe = -εoE2/2 [N m-2], so E = (-2Pe/εo)0.5 = (2×25/8.8×10-12)0.5 = 2.4 
[MV/m].   At  4  cm  distance  this  field  yields  ~95  kV  potential  difference  between  the 
sheets.  The tiny charge involved renders this voltage harmless. 

5.2.2  Magnetic Lorentz forces on currents in conductors 

The Lorentz force law can also be used to compute forces on electrons moving within conductors 
for which μ = μo.  Computation of forces for  the case μ ≠ μo  is  treated  in Sections 5.3.3 and 5.4. 
If there is no net charge and no current flowing in a wire, the forces on the positive and negative 
charges all cancel because the charges comprising matter are bound together by strong inter- and 
intra-atomic forces.

The  simplicity  of  this  equation  and  the  ease  of measurement  of  F,  I,  and  r  led  to  its  use  in 
defining the permeability of free space, μo = 4π×10-7 Henries/meter, and hence the definition of a 
Henry (the unit of  inductance).   If the  two currents are  in opposite directions,  the force acting on 
the wires is repulsive.  For example, if I = 10 amperes and r = 2 millimeters, then (5.2.9) yields F 
=  4π×10-7  ×  102/2π2×10-3  =  0.01  Newtons/meter;  this  is  approximately  the  average  repulsive 
force  between  the  two wires  in  a  120-volt AC  lamp  cord  delivering  one  kilowatt.    These  forces 
are  attractive  when  the  currents  are  parallel,  so  if  we  consider  a  single  wire  as  consisting  of

parallel  strands,  they  will  squeeze  together  due  to  this  pinch  effect.    At  extreme  currents,  these 
forces  can  actually  crush  wires,  so  the  maximum  achievable  instantaneous  current  density  in 
wires  is  partly  limited  by  their mechanical  strength.    The  same  effect  can  pinch  electron  beams 
flowing in charge-neutral plasmas. 

The  magnetic  fields  associated  with  surface  currents  on  flat  conductors  generally  exert  a

Forces on bound charges within materials 

5.3.1 

Introduction 

Forces  on  materials  can  be  calculated  in  three  different  ways:  1)  via  the  Lorentz  force  law,  as 
illustrated  in  Section  5.2  for  free  charges within materials,  2)  via  energy methods,  as  illustrated 
in  Section  5.4,  and  3)  via  photonic  forces,  as  discussed  in  Section  5.6.    When  polarized  or 
magnetized materials are present, as discussed here in Section 5.3, the Lorentz force law must be 
applied  not  only  to  the  free  charges  within  the  materials,  i.e.  the  surface  charges  and  currents 
discussed  earlier,  but  also  to  the  orbiting  and  spinning  charges  bound  within  atoms.   When  the 
Lorenz force equation is applied to these bound charges, the result is the Kelvin polarization and 
magnetization force densities.  Under the paradigm developed in this chapter these Kelvin forces 
must  be  added  to  the  Lorentz  forces  on  the  free  charges16.  The  Kelvin  force  densities  are  non­
zero  only  when  inhomogeneous  fields  are  present,  as  discussed  below  in  Sections  5.3.2  and 
5.3.3.  But  before  discussing  Kelvin  forces  it  is  useful  to  review  the  relationship  between  the 
Lorentz force law and matter. 

The Lorentz  force  law  is  complete  and  exact  if we  ignore  relativistic  issues  associated with 
either  extremely  high  velocities  or  field  strengths;  neither  circumstance  is  relevant  to  current 
commercial  products.  To  compute  all  the  Lorentz  forces  on  matter  we  must  recognize  that 
classical  matter  is  composed  of  atoms  comprised  of  positive  and  negative  charges,  some  of 
which  are moving  and  exhibit magnetic moments  due  to  their  spin  or  orbital motions.   Because 
these  charges  are  trapped  in  the  matter,  any  forces  on  them  are  transferred  to  that  matter,  as 
assumed  in Section 5.2  for electric  forces on  surface  charges  and  for magnetic  forces on  surface 
currents. 

When  applying  the  Lorentz  force  law  within  matter  under  our  paradigm  it  is  important  to 
use the expression: 

( + v × μ o H  Newtons 
)
]
[ 
f  = q E 

(5.3.1) 

without substituting  μH  for the last term when μ ≠ μo.  A simple example illustrates the dangers 
of  this  common  notational  shortcut.    Consider  the  instantaneous  magnetic  pressure  (5.2.13) 
derived using  the Lorentz force  law for a uniform plane wave normally incident on a conducting 
plate  having  μ ≠ μo.  The  same  force  is  also  found  later  in  (5.6.5)  using  photon momentum.    If 
we incorrectly use: 

f  = q E( + v × μ H )

[ Newtons ] 

(incorrect for this example) 

(5.3.2) 

16 The division here between Lorentz  forces  acting on  free  charges  and  the Lorentz  forces  acting on bound  charges 
(often  called  Kelvin  forces)  is  complete  and  accurate,  but  not  unique,  for  these  forces  can  be  grouped  and  labeled 
differently, leading to slightly different expressions that are also correct. 

- 136 -


because  v   occurs  within  μ ,  then  the  computed  wave  pressure  would  increase  with  μ,  whereas 
the  photon  model  has  no  such  dependence  and  yields  Pm  = μoH 2  2 ,  the  same  answer  as  does 
(5.2.13).  The  photon  model  depends  purely  on  the  input  and  output  photon  momentum  fluxes 
observed  some  distance  from  the  mirror,  and  thus  the  details  of  the  mirror  construction  are 
irrelevant once the fraction of photons reflected is known. 

This  independence  of  the  Lorentz  force  from  μ  can  also  be  seen  directly  from  the  Lorentz 
force  calculation  that  led  to  (5.2.13).    In  this  case  the  total  surface  current  is  not  a  function  of μ 
for  a  perfect  reflector,  and  neither  is  H   just  below  the  surface;  they  depend  only  upon  the 
incident  wave  and  the  fact  that  the  mirror  is  nearly  perfect.  H   does  decay  faster  with  depth 
when  μ  is  large,  as  discussed  in  Section  9.3,  but  the  average  H   experienced  by  the  surface-
current  electrons  is  still  half  the  value  of  H   at  the  surface,  so  f   is  unchanged  as  μ varies.  The 
form  of  the  Lorentz  force  law  presented  in  (5.3.2)  can  therefore  be  safely  used  under  our  force 
paradigm only when μ = μo, although the magnetic term is often written as  v B .× 

There  are  alternate  correct  paradigms  that  use  μ  in  the  Lorentz  law  rather  than  μo,  but  they 
interpret  Maxwell’s  equations  slightly  differently.    These  alternative  approaches  are  not 
discussed here. 

The  Lorentz  force  law  can  also  be  applied  to  those  cases where  non-uniform  fields  pull  on 
dielectrics or permeable materials, as suggested by Figure 5.3.1.   These problems are often more 
easily  solved,  however,  using  energy  (Section  5.4)  or  pressure  (Section  5.5)  methods.    To 
compute  in  general  the  forces  on  matter  exerted  by  non-uniform  electric  or  magnetic  fields  we 
can derive  the Kelvin polarization and magnetization force density expressions  from  the Lorentz 
equation, as shown in Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, respectively.

The  derivations  of  the  Kelvin  force  density  expressions  are  based  on  the  following  simple 
models  for  charges  in matter.    Electric  Lorentz  forces  act  on  atomic  nuclei  and  the  surrounding 
electron clouds that are bound together, and on any free charges.  The effect of⎯E on positive and 
negative  charges  bound  within  an  atom  is  to  displace  their  centers  slightly,  inducing  a  small 
electric dipole.  The resulting atomic electric dipole moment is: 

- 137 -


p dq=

 

(Coulomb meters) 

(5.3.3) 

where  d   is  the displacement vector  [m] pointing  from  the negative  charge  center  to  the positive 
charge center  for each atom, and q  is  the atomic charge or atomic number.   As discussed  further 
in Section 5.3.2, Kelvin polarization forces result when the field gradients cause the electric field 
lines to curve slightly so that the directions of the electric Lorentz forces are slightly different for 
the  two  ends  of  the  field-induced  electric  dipoles  so  they  do  not  cancel  exactly,  leaving  a  net 
residual force. 

The  magnetic  Lorentz  forces  act  on  electrons  classically  orbiting  atomic  nuclei  with 
velocities  v , and act on electrons with classical charge densities spinning at velocity  v  about the 
electron  spin axis.   Protons also  spin, and  therefore both electrons and protons possess magnetic 
dipole moments; these spin moments are smaller than those due to electron orbital motion.  If we 
consider  these  spin  and  orbital motions  as  being  associated with  current  loops,  then  we  can  see 
that  the net  force on such a  loop would be non-zero  if  the magnetic  fields perpendicular  to  these 
currents  were  different  on  the  two  sides  of  the  loop.    Such  differences  exist  when  the magnetic 
field has a non-zero gradient and then Kelvin magnetization forces result, as discussed in Section 
5.3.3.  The electromagnetic properties of matter are discussed further in Sections 2.5 and 9.5. 

5.3.2  Kelvin polarization force density 

Kelvin  polarization  forces  result  when  a  non-zero  electric  field  gradient  causes  the  Lorentz 
electric  forces  on  the  two  charge  centers  of  each  induced  electric  dipole  in  a  dielectric  to  differ, 
as illustrated in Figure 5.3.1(a).  The force density can be found by summing the force imbalance 
vectors for each dipole within a unit volume. 

Assume  the  center  of  the  negative  charge  -q  for  a  particular  atom  is  at  r ,  and  the  center  of 
.  Then  the  net  electric  Lorentz  force  on  that  atom  in  the  x 
the  positive  charge  +q  is  at  r d+ 
direction is:

Thus  f x   is  the  projection  of  the  charge  offset  d   on  the  gradient  of  qEx.  We  recall 
∇ ≡ xˆ ∂/∂x + yˆ ∂/∂y + zˆ ∂/∂z. 

Equation (5.3.4) can easily be generalized to: 
f  = xˆ ( qd • ∇ E x ) + yˆ ( qd • ∇ E y ) + zˆ ( qd • ∇ Ez ) 

= xˆ ( p •∇ E x ) + yˆ ( p • ∇E y ) + zˆ ( p •∇ E z ) ≡ p • ∇E  [ N ]

Equation  (5.3.6)  then  yields  the  Kelvin  polarization  force  density  Fp  = n f  ,  where  n  is  the 
density of atomic dipoles [m-3], and the polarization density of the material  P  is  n p  [C m-2]:

Equation  (5.3.7)  states  that  electrically  polarized  materials  are  pulled  into  regions  having 
stronger  electric  fields  if  there  is  polarization  P   in  the  direction  of  the  gradient.  Less  obvious 
from  (5.3.7)  is  the  fact  that  there can be such a  force even when  the applied electric  field  E  and  
P   are  orthogonal  to  the  field  gradient,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.3.1(a).    In  this  example  a  z-
polarized dielectric  is drawn  in  the x direction  into  regions of stronger Ez.  This happens  in curl-
free fields because then a non-zero ∂Ez/∂x implies a non-zero ∂Ex/∂z that contributes to  Fp .  This 
relation between partial derivatives follows from the definition:

Since  each  cartesian  component  must  equal  zero,  it  follows  that  ∂Ex/∂z  =  ∂Ez/∂x  so  both  these 
derivatives  are  non-zero,  as  claimed.   Note  that  if  the  field  lines  E  were  not  curved,  then  fx =  0 
in Figure 5.3.1.  But such fields with a gradient ∇Ez  ≠ 0 would have non-zero curl, which would 
require current to flow in the insulating region.

5.3.3  Kelvin magnetization force density 

Magnetic  dipoles  are  induced  in  permeable  materials  by  magnetic  fields.    These  induced 
magnetic  dipoles  arise  when  the  applied  magnetic  field  slightly  realigns  the  randomly  oriented 

- 139 -

pre-existing magnetic  dipoles  associated with  electron  spins  and  electron  orbits  in  atoms.    Each 
such induced magnetic dipole can be modeled as a small current loop, such as the one pictured in 
Figure 5.3.1(b)  in  the x-y plane.   The collective effect of  these  induced  atomic magnetic dipoles 
is  a  permeability  μ  that  differs  from  μo,  as  discussed  further  in  Section  2.5.4.    Prior  to 
realignment of the magnetic dipoles in a magnetizable medium by an externally applied  H , their  
orientations are generally random so that their effects cancel and can be neglected. 

Kelvin  magnetization  forces  on  materials  result  when  a  non-zero  magnetic  field  gradient 
causes the Lorentz magnetic forces on the two current centers of each induced magnetic dipole to 
differ  so  they  no  longer  cancel,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.3.1(b).    The  magnified  portion  of  the 
figure shows a typical current loop in cross-section where the magnetic Lorentz forces fx1 and fx2 
are  unbalanced  because  B1   and  B2   differ.  The  magnetic  flux  density  B1   acts  on  the  current 
flowing  in  the  -y  direction,  and  the  magnetic  field  B2   acts  on  the  equal  and  opposite  current 
flowing  in  the  +y  direction.  The  force  density  Fm   can  be  found  by  summing  the  net  force 
vectors  for  every  such  induced  magnetic  dipole  within  a  unit  volume.    This  net  force  density 
pulls a medium with μ > μo into the high-field region. 

The current loops induced in magnetic materials such as iron and nickel tend to increase the 
applied magnetic  field  H ,  as  illustrated,  so  that  the  permeable material  in  the  figure  has  μ  >  μo 
and  experiences  a  net  force  that  tends  to  move  it  toward  more  intense  magnetic  fields.    That  is 
why  magnets  attract  iron  and  any  paramagnetic  material  that  has  μ  >  μo,  while  repulsing  any 
diamagnetic material  for which  the  induced  current  loops have  the opposite polarity  so  that μ < 
μo.  Although  most  ordinary  materials  are  either  paramagnetic  or  diamagnetic  with  μ ≅ μ,  only 
ferromagnetic materials such as iron and nickel have μ >> μo and are visibly affected by ordinary 
magnets. 

An expression for  the Kelvin magnetization force density  Fm  can be derived by calculating 
the  forces  on  a  square  current  loop  of  I  amperes  in  the  x-y  plane,  as  illustrated.    The  Lorentz 
magnetic force on each of the four legs is: 

Hw  [ N ] 
f  = × μ o 
I 
i

where i = 1,2,3,4, and w is the length of each leg.  The sum of these four forces is: 

f  = Iw  2μo  ⎣⎡( yˆ × ∂H ∂x ) − ( xˆ × ∂H ∂y )⎤⎦   [N]
 
2μ  ⎡− zˆ  ∂H  ∂  + ∂ 
x  H y  ∂y ) + xˆ ( ∂H z  ∂x ) + yˆ ( ∂H z  ∂y )⎤⎦ 
( 
= Iw  
o  ⎣
x 

(5.3.9)

(5.3.10) 

This expression can be simplified by noting that  m = zˆIw
2  is the magnetic dipole moment of this 
 
=H 0 , while ∂Hz/∂x = ∂Hx/∂z and 
current loop, and that ∂Hx/∂x + ∂Hy/∂y = - ∂Hz/∂z because  ∇ •
∂Hz/∂y  =  ∂Hy/∂z  because  ∇ × H 0   in  the  absence  of  macroscopic  currents.   
Thus  for  the 
=
geometry  of Figure  5.3.1(b), where  m   is  in  the  z  direction,  the magnetization  force  of Equation 
(5.3.10) becomes: 

- 140 -

(5.3.12) 

where the novel notation  m • ∇H  was defined in (5.3.6). 

Equation (5.3.12) then yields the Kelvin magnetization force density  Fm  = n 3 f  , where n3 is 
the  equivalent  density  of  magnetic  dipoles  [m-3],  and  the  magnetization  M   of  the  material  is 
n m  [A m-1]:

(5.3.13) 

Such  forces  exist  even  when  the  applied  magnetic  field  H   and  the  magnetization  M   are 
orthogonal  to  the  field  gradient,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.3.1(b).    As  in  the  case  of  Kelvin 
polarization  forces,  this  happens  in  curl-free  fields  because  then  a  non-zero  ∂Hz/∂x  implies  a 
non-zero ∂Hx/∂z that contributes to  Fm .

Forces computed using energy methods 

5.4.1  Relationship between force and energy 

Mechanics  teaches  that  a  force  f  in  the  z  direction  pushing  an  object  a  distance  dz  expends 
energy dw = f dz [J], so: 

=f

dw dz

(force/energy equation) 

(5.4.1) 

Therefore  the  net  force  fbe  applied  by  the  environment  to  any  object  in  the  z  direction  can  be 
found simply by differentiating the total system energy w with respect to motion of that object in 
the direction z.  The total force vector  f be  is the sum of its x, y, and z components. 

Care must be  taken, however,  to ensure  that  the  total  system energy  is differentiated, which 
can  include  the  energy  in  any  connected  power  supplies,  mechanical  elements,  etc.    Care  must 
also  be  taken  to  carefully  distinguish  between  forces  fbe  exerted  by  the  environment,  and  forces 
foe  exerted  by  objects  on  their  environment;  otherwise  sign  errors  are  readily  introduced.  This 
simple  powerful  approach  to  finding  forces  is  illustrated  in  Section  5.4.2  for  electrostatic  forces 
and  in Section 5.6 for photonic forces.  The energy approach  to calculating magnetic forces uses 
(5.4.1)  in a  straightforward way, but examples are postponed  to Chapter 6 when magnetic  fields 
in structures will be better understood. 

- 141 -


Example 5.4A 
A  certain  perfectly  conducting  electromagnet  carrying  one  ampere  exerts  an  attractive  100-N 
force  f  on  a  piece  of  iron while  it moves  away  from  the magnet  at  velocity  v =  1  [m  s-1].  What 
voltage V  is  induced  across  the  terminals  of  the  electromagnet  as  a  result  of  this  velocity  v?    Is 
this  voltage  V  positive  or  negative  on  that  terminal  where  the  current  enters  the  magnet?  Use 
conservation of power. 

Solution:  	 Conservation  of  power  requires  fv  =  VI,  so  V  =  fv/I  =  100×1/1  =  100  volts.  The 
voltage is negative because the magnet is acting as a generator since the motion of the 
iron is opposite to the magnetic force acting on it. 

5.4.2  Electrostatic forces on conductors and dielectrics 

The  energy  method  easily  yields  the  force  fbe  needed  to  separate  in  the  z  direction  the  two 
isolated  capacitor plates oppositely  charged with Q  in vacuum  and  illustrated  in Figure 5.2.1(a). 
Since  the plates are attracted  to one another, separating  them does work and  increases  the stored 
energy  w.  The  force  needed  to  hold  the  plates  apart  is  easily  found  using  the  force/energy 
equation (5.4.1): 

f be  = dw

εoA ) ds

(5.4.2) 

where  the  plate  separation  is  s  and  the  plate  area  is  A.    The  electric  energy  we  stored  in  a 
capacitor  C  is  CV2/2  =  Q2/2C  =  Q2s/2εA,  where  Q  =  CV  and  C  =  εA/s,  as  shown  in  Section 
3.1.3.  Here we assumed ε = εo. 

The  derivative  in  (5.4.2)  was  easy  to  evaluate  because  Q  remains  constant  as  the 
disconnected plates are forced apart.  It would be incorrect to use w = CV2/2 when differentiating 
(5.4.2)  unless  we  recognize  that  V  increases  as  the  plates  separate  because  V  =  Q/C  when  C 
decreases. 
It  is  easier  to  express  energy  in  terms  of  parameters  that  remain  constant  as  z 
changes. 

We can put (5.4.2) in the more familiar form (5.2.4) for the electric pressure Pe pushing on a 
conductor  by  noting  that  the  force  fbe  needed  to  separate  the  plates  is  the  same  as  the  electric 
force attracting the oppositely charged plates.  The force fbe thus balances the electric pressure on 
the same plates and Pe = -fbe/A.  Since Q = εoEA here we find: 

Pe  = −Q2  2εoA 2  = −ε oE 2  2 

⎣⎡ Nm

⎦⎤	

 

 

(5.4.3) 

This  static  attractive  pressure  of  electric  fields  remains  the  same  if  the  plates  are  connected 
to a battery of voltage V  instead of being  isolated;  the Lorentz forces are  the same  in both cases. 
A  more  awkward  way  to  calculate  the  same  force  (5.4.2)  is  to  assume  (unnecessarily)  that  a 
battery is connected and that V remains constant as s changes.  In this case Q must vary with dz, 
and  dQ  flows  into  the  battery,  increasing  its  energy  by  VdQ.    Since  dw  in  the  force/energy 
expression  (5.4.2)  is  the  change  in  total  system  energy,  the  changes  in  both  battery  and  electric 

- 142 -


field energy must be calculated to yield the correct energy; an example with a battery begins later 
with  (5.4.5).    As  illustrated  above,  this  complexity  can  be  avoided  by  carefully  restating  the 
problem without the source, and by expressing w in terms of electrical variables (Q here) that do 
not vary with position (s here). 

The power of  the energy method  (5.4.1)  is much more evident when calculating  the  force⎯f 
needed  to  pull  two  capacitor  plates  apart  laterally,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  5.4.1(a).    To  use  the 
Lorentz  force  law  directly would  require  knowledge  of  the  lateral  components  of⎯E  responsible 
for  the  lateral  forces, but  they are not  readily determined.   Since energy derivatives can often be 
computed  accurately  and  easily  (provided  the  fringing  fields  are  relatively  small),  that  is  often 
the preferred method for computing electric and magnetic forces.

The  force/energy  equation  (5.4.1)  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  area  A  =  WL  of  the

overlap L is negative, and the force exerted on the plates by the environment is:

where dz = dL and we = Q2s/2WL.  We again assumed that the plates were isolated in space so Q 
was  constant,  but  the  same  force  results when  the  plates  are  attached  to  a  battery;  in  both  cases 
the Lorentz forces arise from the very same charges so the two forces must be identical. 

For  purposes  of  illustration,  let’s  solve  the  force/energy  equation  (5.4.1)  for  the  same 
problem  of  Figure  5.4.1  the more  difficult  way  by  including  the  increase  in  battery  energy  as  z 
increases.  The incremental work fbedz involved in pulling the plates apart a distance dz is: 
f be  = dw T  dz = −  ε d ( oWLV  2s ) dL − VdQ  dz

(5.4.5) 

where wT is the total energy and the two terms on the right-hand side of (5.4.5) reflect the energy 
changes  in  the  capacitor  and  battery  respectively.    The  first  negative  sign  in  (5.4.5)  arises 
because  the  overlap  distance  L  decreases  as  z  increases,  and  the  second  negative  sign  arises 
because the battery energy increases as Q decreases.

using V = Q/C and C = εoWL/s:

Electric and magnetic pressure 

5.5.1  Electromagnetic pressures acting on conductors 

Forces on materials can be computed in several different ways, all of which can be derived using 
Maxwell’s  equations  and  the  Lorentz  force  law.    The  pressure  method  for  computing  forces 
arising  from  static  fields  is  useful  because  it  expresses  prior  results  in  ways  that  are  easy  to 
evaluate  and  remember,  and  that  have  physical  significance.    The method  simply  notes  that  the 
electromagnetic force density (pressure) acting on the interface between two materials equals the 
difference in the electromagnetic energy densities on the two sides of the interface.  Both energy 
density [J m-3] and pressure [N m-2] have identical units because [J] = [N m]. 

For  example,  both  the Lorentz  force  law  and  the  energy method  yield  the  same  expression, 
(5.2.4) and (5.4.3) respectively, for the electric pressure Pe due to a static electric field E pushing 
on a conductor:

Thus motor  and  actuator  forces  are  limited  principally  by  the  ability  of material  systems  to 
sustain  large  static  fields without breaking down  in  some way.   Because  large magnetic  systems 
can  sustain  larger  energy  densities  than  comparable  systems  based  on  electric  fields,  essentially 
all large motors, generators, and actuators are magnetic.  Only for devices with gaps on the order 
of  a  micron  or  less  is  the  electrical  breakdown  field  strength  sufficiently  high  that  electrostatic 
and magnetic motors compete more evenly with respect to power density, as discussed in Section 
6.2.5. 

5.5.2  Electromagnetic pressures acting on permeable and dielectric media 

The Kelvin polarization  and magnetization  force densities,  (5.3.7)  and  (5.3.13)  respectively,  can 
also  be  expressed  in  terms  of  energy  densities  and  pressures.    First  we  recall  that

Two  examples  treated  in  Chapter  6  using  energy  methods  suggest  the  utility  of  simple 
pressure  equations.  Figure  6.2.4  shows  a  parallel-plate  capacitor  with  a  dielectric  slab  that  fits 
snugly between  the plates but  that is only partially  inserted  in  the z direction a distance D  that  is 
much  less  than  the  length L of both  the slab and  the capacitor plates.   The electric  field between 
the plates  is  E , both  inside and outside  the dielectric  slab.   The  total  force on  the dielectric  slab 
is  the  integral  of  the  Kelvin  polarization  force  density  (5.5.7)  over  the  volume  V  of  the  slab, 
where V = LA and A is the area of the endface of the slab.  We find from (5.5.7) that  Fp  is in the 
zˆ  direction and is non-zero only near the end of the capacitor plates where z = 0:

The integral is evaluated between the limit z = 0 where E ≅ 0 outside the capacitor plates, and the 
maximum  value  z  =  D  where  the  electric  field  between  the  plates  is  E .   Thus  the  pressure 
method yields the total force fz on the dielectric slab; it is the area A of the end of the slab, times 
2
the  electric  pressure  (ε − εo ) E 2  [N  m-2]  at  the  end  of  the  slab  that  is  pulling  the  slab  further 
between  the plates.  This pressure  is zero at  the other end of  the  slab because  E 0   there.  This
≅
pressure is the same as will be found in (6.2.21) using energy methods. 

The second example is illustrated in Figure 6.4.1, where a snugly fitting cylindrical iron slug 
of area A has been pulled a distance D into a solenoidal coil that produces an axial magnetic field 
H.  As  in  the  case  of  the  dielectric  slab,  one  end  of  the  slug  protrudes  sufficiently  far  from  the 
coil  that H at  that end  is approximately zero.   The  force pulling on  the  slug  is easily  found  from 
(5.5.9):

This  is more  exact  than  the  answer  found  in  (6.4.10), where  the μo  term was omitted  in  (6.4.10) 
when the energy stored in the air was neglected.

To  summarize,  the  static  electromagnetic  pressure  [N  m-2]  acting  on  a  material  interface 
with  either  free  space  or  mobile  liquids  or  gases  is  the  difference  between  the  two 
electromagnetic energy densities [J m-3] on either side of that interface, provided that the relevant 
E  and  H  are curl-free.  In  the case of dielectric or magnetic media,  the pressure on  the material 
is  directed  away  from  the  greater  energy  density.    In  the  case  of  conductors,  external  magnetic 
fields  press  on  them while  electric  fields  pull;  the  energy  density  inside  the  conductor  is  zero  in 
both cases because  E  and  H  are presumed to be zero there. 

Note  that  the  pressure  method  for  calculating  forces  on  interfaces  is  numerically  correct 
even  when  the  true  physical  locus  of  the  force  may  lie  elsewhere.    For  example,  the  Kelvin 
polarization forces for a dielectric slab being pulled  into a capacitor are concentrated at  the edge 
of  the capacitor plates at z = 0  in Figure 6.2.4, which  is physically correct, whereas  the pressure 
method  implies  incorrectly  that  the  force on  the  slab  is concentrated at  its end between  the plate 
where z = D.  The energy method does not address this issue. 

Example 5.5A 
At what  radius  r  from  a  1-MV  high  voltage  line  does  the  electric  force  acting  on  a  dust  particle 
having ε = 10εo exceed the gravitational force if its density ρ is 1 gram/cm3?  Assume the electric 
field  around  the  line  is  the  same  as  between  concentric  cylinders  having  radii  a  =  1  cm  and  b  = 
10 m. 

Solution:	 The Kelvin  polarization  force  density  (5.5.7)  can  be  integrated  over  the  volume  v  of 
the  particle  and  equated  to  the  gravitational  force  fg  =  ρvg  =  ~10-3v10  [N].  (5.5.7) 
yields  the  total  Kelvin  force:⎯fK  =  v(ε - εo)∇|⎯E  |2/2  where⎯E(r)  =  rˆ V/[r  ln(b/a)]  [V 
m-1].  ∇|⎯E  |2 = [V/ln(b/a)]2∇r  -2 = -2 rˆ [V/ln(b/a)]2r -3, where the gradient here, ∇ =  rˆ 
∂/∂r, was  computed  using  cylindrical  coordinates  (see Appendix C).    Thus  fg  =  |⎯fK  | 
becomes  10-2v  =  v9εo  [V/ln(b/a)]2r  -3,  so  r  =  {900εo[V/ln(b/a)]2}1/3  =  {900×8.85×10­
12[106/ln(1000)]2}1/3  =  5.5 meters,  independent  of  the  size  of  the  particle.    Thus  high 
voltage lines make excellent dust catchers for dielectric particles. 

5.6 

Photonic forces 

Photonic  forces  arise whenever  electromagnetic waves  are  absorbed or  reflected by objects,  and 
can  be  found  using  either  wave  or  photon  paradigms.    Section  5.2.2  derived  the  magnetic 
pressure  Pm   (5.2.13)  applied  by  a  surface  magnetic  field  Hs(t)  that  is  parallel  to  a  flat  perfect 
conductor in the x-y plane: 

Pm  = μ H 2 2 ⎣⎡  Nm
zˆ o s
 

-2 ⎦⎤ 

(magnetic pressure on perfect conductor) 
 

(5.6.1)

Thus  this  instantaneous  magnetic  pressure  perpendicular  to  the  conductor  surface  equals  the 
adjacent magnetic energy density ([N m-2] = [J m-3]). 

In  the  sinusoidal  steady  state  the  time  average  pressure  is  half  the  peak  instantaneous  value 
given  by  (5.6.1),  where  Hs(t)  =  Hs  cos  ωt.  This  average  pressure  on  a  perfectly  reflecting 

- 147 -


conductor  can  also  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  time-average  Poynting  vector 
incident wave characterized by H+ cos ωt:

⎣⎡Nm  -2 ⎤⎦ 

(5.6.2)

where Hs = 2H+ and  S( t )

2/2; the impedance of free space ηo = μo/c.
= ηoH+

It  is  now  easy  to  relate  S( t )   to  the  photon  momentum  flux,  which  also  yields  pressure. 
We recall17 that: 

photon momentum  M = hf  c 

⎡⎣ Nm s -1 ⎤⎦ 

(5.6.3) 

The  momentum  transferred  to  a  mirror  upon  perfect  reflection  of  a  single  photon  at  normal 
incidence is therefore 2hf/c. 

We recall from mechanics that the force f required to change momentum mv is: 

f

) mv
= (

(5.6.4)

so  that  the  total  radiation  pressure  on  a  perfect  mirror  reflecting  directly  backwards  n  photons 
[s-1m-2] is: 

Pr = n 2hf

 c
 = 2

 S( t )

 c ⎡⎣  Nm

-2 ⎤⎦ 

 

(radiation pressure on a mirror) 

(5.6.5) 

consistent  with  (5.6.2).  Thus  we  have  shown  that  both  the  Lorentz  force  method  and  the 
photonic  force  method  yield  the  same  pressure  on  perfectly  reflecting  mirrors;  Pm  =  Pr.  The 
factor of  two  in  (5.6.5) arises because photon momentum  is not zeroed but reversed by a mirror. 
If  these  photons  were  absorbed  rather  than  reflected,  the  rate  of  momentum  transfer  to  the 
absorber would  be  halved.  In  general  if  the  incident  and  normally  reflected  power  densities  are 
S1  and 
, respectively, then the average radiation pressure on the mirror is: 
S2 

P  = S1 + S2  c 

(5.6.6) 

If  the  photons  are  incident  at  an  angle,  the momentum  transfer  is  reduced  by  the  cosine  of 
the  angle  of  incidence  and  reflection.    And  if  the mirror  is  partially  transparent,  the momentum 
transfer is reduced by that fraction of the photon momentum that passes through unaltered. 

17 A  crude  plausibility  argument  for  (5.6.3)  is  the  following.   The  energy of  a  photon  is  hf  [J],  half  being magnetic 
and half being electric.  We have seen  in  (5.2.1) and  (5.2.13)  that only  the magnetic  fields contribute  to  the Lorentz 
force on a normal reflecting conductor for which both E⊥ and H⊥ = 0, so we might notionally associate hf/2 with the 
“kinetic  energy  of  a  photon”,  where  kinetic  energy  is  linked  to  momentum.    If  photons  had  mass  m,  this  notional 
kinetic  energy  hf/2  would  equal  mc2/2,  and  the  notional  associated  momentum  mc  of  a  photon  would  then  equal 
hf/c, its actual value.

Consider the simple example of a reflective solar sail blown by radiation pressure across the 
solar system, sailing from planet to planet.  At earth the solar radiation intensity is ~1400 W/m2, 
so  (5.6.6)  yields,  for  example,  the  total  force  f  on  a  sail  of  projected  area  A  intercepting  one 
square kilometer of radiation:

( 
f  = A P  = A2 S  t ( )  c ≤ 106 × × 2  1400  3  10 ×
[
≅ 9  N	

]

(5.6.7) 

A  sail  this  size  one micron  thick  and  having  the  density  of water would  have  a mass m  of  1000 
kg.  Since  the  sail  velocity  v  =  at  =  (f/m)t,  where  a  is  acceleration  and  t  is  time,  it  follows  that 
after  one  year  the  accumulated  velocity  of  a  sail  facing  such  constant  pressure  in  vacuum  could 
be  as  much  as  (9/1000)3×107  ≅ 3×105  ms-1  =  c/1000.  Of  course  the  solar  photon  pressure 
declines as the square of the solar distance, and solar gravity would also act on such sails. 

Example 5.6A 
What  force  F  [N]  is  exerted  on  a  3-watt  flashlight  (λ ≅  0.5  microns)  as  a  result  of  the  exiting 
photons? 

Solution:  	 E  =  hf  and  power  P  = Nhf  =  3 watts, where N  is  the  number  of  photons  per  second. 
The  force  F  =  Nhf/c,  where  hf/c  is  the  momentum  of  a  single  photon,  and  N  =  3/hf 
here.  So F = 3/c = 10-8 Newtons.  A Newton approximates  the gravitational  force on 
the  quarter-pound  package  of  fig  newtons.  This  force  pushes  the  flashlight  in  the 
direction opposite to that of the light beam.

Chapter 6:  Actuators and Sensors, Motors and Generators 

6.1 

Force-induced electric and magnetic fields 

6.1.1 

Introduction 

Chapter 5 explained how electric and magnetic  fields could exert  force on charges, currents, and 
media, and how electrical power  into such devices could be  transformed  into mechanical power. 
Chapter  6  explores  several  types  of  practical  motors  and  actuators  built  using  these  principles, 
where  an  actuator  is  typically  a  motor  that  throws  a  switch  or  performs  some  other  brief  task 
from time to time.  Chapter 6 also explores the reverse transformation, where mechanical motion 
alters  electric  or  magnetic  fields  and  converts  mechanical  to  electrical  power.    Absent  losses, 
conversions to electrical power can be nearly perfect and find application in electrical generators 
and mechanical sensors. 

Section  6.1.2  first  explores  how  mechanical  motion  of  conductors  or  charges  through 
magnetic  fields  can  generate  voltages  that  can  be  tapped  for  power.    Two  charged  objects  can 
also  be  forcefully  separated,  lengthening  the  electric  field  lines  connecting  them  and  thereby 
increasing  their  voltage  difference,  where  this  increased  voltage  can  be  tapped  for  purposes  of 
sensing  or  electrical  power  generation.    Section  6.1.3  then  shows  in  the  context  of  a  current-
carrying wire in a magnetic field how power conversion can occur in either direction. 

6.1.2  Motion-induced voltages 

Any  conductor moving  across magnetic  field  lines  acquires  an  open-circuit  voltage  that  follows 
directly from the Lorentz force law (6.1.1)18: 

f = q(E + v ×  μ oH) 

(6.1.1) 

Consider the electron illustrated in Figure 6.1.1, which has charge –e and velocity⎯v.

18 Some  textbooks present alternative explanations  that  lead  to  the same  results.   The explanation here views matter 
as  composed  of  charged  particles  governed  electromagnetically  solely  by  the  Lorentz  force  law,  and  other  forces, 
such as the Kelvin force densities acting on media discussed in Section 4.5, are derived from it.

It  is moving  perpendicular  to  H   and  therefore  experiences  a  Lorentz  force  on  it  of  ev

× μ  H

o 
It  experiences  that  force  even  inside  a  moving  wire  and  will  accelerate  in  response  to  it.    This 
force  causes  all  free  electrons  inside  the  conductor  to  move  until  the  resulting  surface  charges 
produce an equilibrium electric field distribution such that the net force on any electron is zero. 

In  the  case  of  a  moving  open-circuited  wire,  the  free  charges  (electrons)  will  move  inside 
the wire and accumulate  toward  its ends until  there  is sufficient electric potential across  the wire 
to  halt  their  movement  everywhere.    Specifically,  this  Lorentz  force  balance  requires  that  the 
force  -eE  on  the  electrons  due  to  the  resulting  electric  field⎯Ee  be  equal  and  opposite  to  those
e
due to the magnetic field 
-ev × μ  H , that is:

Therefore the equilibrium electric field inside the wire must be: 

eE 

v= −  × μ  H

(6.1.2) 

(6.1.3) 

There should be no confusion about  Ee  being non-zero inside a conductor.  It is the net force on 
free  electrons  that  must  be  zero  in  equilibrium,  not  the  electric  field  Ee .  The  electric  Lorentz 
force  qEe   must  balance  the  magnetic  Lorentz  force  or  otherwise  the  charges  will  experience  a 
net force that continues to move them until there is such balance.

If the wire were open-circuited, the potential Φ across it would be the integral of the electric field 
necessary to cancel the magnetic forces on the electrons, where: 

Φ =  μ ov HW

(6.1.4) 

and  the signs and directions are as  indicated  in  the  figure.   We assume  that  the  fields, wires, and 
velocity  v   in  the  figure  are  all  orthogonal  so  that  v × μo H   contributes  no  potential  differences 
except along the wire of length W.

Example 6.1A 
A  large  metal  airplane  flies  at  300  m  s-1  relative  to  a  vertical  terrestrial  magnetic  field  of  ~10-4 
Teslas (1 gauss).  What is the open-circuit voltage V wingtip to wingtip if the wingspan W is ~40 
meters?  If  B  points upwards, is the right wing positive or negative?

V  =  WvμoH  ≅  40×300×1.26×10-6×10-4  ≅  1.5×10-6  volts,  and  the  right  wingtip  is 
positive. 

6.1.3 

Induced currents and back voltages 

If  the moving wire of Figure 6.1.2  is connected  to a  load R,  then current I will flow as governed 
by Ohm’s law.   	I depends on Φ, R, and the illustrated Thevenin voltage V: 

I = ( V − Φ ) R = ( V − μ v  oHW  
) R 

(6.1.5) 

The  current  can  be  positive  or  negative,  depending  on  the  relative  values  of  V  and  the  motion-
induced  voltage  Φ.  From  (5.2.7)  we  see  that  the  magnetic  force  density  on  the  wire  is 
F I= × μ o H   [Nm-1].  The  associated  total  force  f be  exerted  on  the wire  by  the  environment  and 
by 	 H  follows from (6.1.5) and is:

(6.1.6) 

where the unit vector  xˆ  is parallel to  v . 

Equation  (6.1.6)  enables  us  to  compute  the  mechanical  power  delivered  to  the  wire  by  the 
environment (Pbe) or, in the reverse direction, by the wire to the environment (Poe), where Pbe = -
Poe.  If  the  voltage  source  V  is  sufficiently  great,  then  the  system  functions  as  a  motor  and  the 
mechanical power Poe delivered to the environment by the wire is:

(6.1.7) 

The  electrical  power  Pe  delivered  by  the  moving  wire  to  the  battery  and  resistor  equals  the 
mechanical power Pbe delivered to the wire by the environment, where I is given by (6.1.5):

(6.1.8) 

The negative sign in the first term of (6.1.8) is associated with the direction of I defined in Figure 
6.1.2;  I  flows  out  of  the Thevenin  circuit while  Pe  flows  in.    If V  is  zero,  then  the wire  delivers 
maximum  power,  Φ2/R.    As  V  increases,  this  delivered  power  diminishes  and  then  becomes 
negative as the system ceases to be an electrical generator and becomes a motor.  As a motor the 

- 153 -


mechanical power delivered  to  the wire by  the environment becomes negative, and  the electrical 
power delivered by the Thevenin source becomes positive.  That is, we have a: 

Motor:	

If mechanical power out Poe > 0, 
V > Φ = vμoHW, or v < V/μoHW 

Generator: 	

If electrical power out Pe > 0, 
V < Φ, or v > V/μoHW 

(6.1.9) 

(6.1.10) 

  We call Φ  the “back voltage” of a motor;  it  increases as  the motor velocity v  increases until 
it  equals  the voltage V of  the power  source  and Pe = 0.  If  the velocity  increases  further  so  that 
 
Φ  >  V,  the  motor  becomes  a  generator.    When  V  =  Φ,  then  I  =  0  and  the  motor  moves  freely 
without any electromagnetic forces. 

This basic coupling mechanism between magnetic and mechanical forces and powers can be 
utilized in many configurations, as discussed further below. 

Example 6.1B 
A  straight wire  is drawn  at velocity v =  xˆ 10 m  s-1 between  the poles of  a 0.1-Tesla magnet;  the 
velocity  vector, wire  direction,  and  field  direction  are  all  orthogonal  to  each  other.    The wire  is 
externally connected to a resistor R = 10-5 ohms.  What mechanical force⎯f is exerted on the wire 
by the magnetic field⎯B?  The geometry is illustrated in Figure 6.1.2. 

Solution:	 The force exerted on the wire by its magnetic environment (6.1.6) is 
⎯fbe =⎯ I  ×⎯HμoW [N], where the induced current I = -Φ/R and the back voltage 
Φ = vμoHW [V].  Therefore: 
fbe = - xˆ μoHWΦ/R = - xˆ v(μoHW)2/R = - xˆ 10×(0.1×0.1)2/10-5 = 1 [N], opposite to⎯v.

Electrostatic actuators and motors 

6.2.1 

Introduction to Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) 

Chapter  6  elaborates  on  Chapter  5  by  exploring  a  variety  of  motors,  generators,  and  sensors  in 
both  linear  and  rotary  configurations.    Electric  examples  are  analyzed  in  Section  6.2,  and 
magnetic  examples  in  Section  6.3.    Section  6.2.1  reviews  the  background,  while  Sections  6.2.2 
and  6.2.3  explore  parallel-capacitor-plate  devices  using  linear  and  rotary  motion  respectively. 
Section  6.2.4  discusses  electrostatic  motors  exerting  forces  on  dielectrics,  while  Section  6.2.5 
discusses  the  limits  to power density posed by electrical breakdown of air or other media, which 
limits peak electric field strength. 

Micro-electromechanical  systems  (MEMS)  are  commonly  used  as  motors,  generators, 
actuators, and sensors and underlie one of the major current revolutions in electrical engineering, 
namely  the  extension  of  integrated  circuit  fabrication  technology  to  electromechanical  systems 
on the same substrate as the circuits with which they interoperate.  Such devices now function as 

- 154 -


optical switches, radio-frequency switches, microphones, accelerometers, thermometers, pressure 
sensors,  chemical  sensors,  micro-fluidic  systems,  electrostatic  and  magnetic  motors,  biological 
sensors,  and other devices.  They  are used  in  systems  as diverse as video projectors,  automobile 
air bag triggers, and mechanical digital memories for hot environments. 

Advantages  of  MEMS  over  their  larger  counterparts  include  size,  weight,  power 
consumption,  and  cost,  and  also  much  increased  speed  due  to  the  extremely  small  masses  and 
distances  involved.  For  example,  some MEMS  electromechanical  switches  can  operate  at MHz 
frequencies,  compared  to  typical  speeds  below  ~1  kHz  for most  traditional mechanical  devices. 
The  feature  size  of MEMS  ranges  from  sub-microns  or microns  up  to  one  or more millimeters, 
although  the basic electromagnetic principles apply  to devices of any  scale.   Recent advances  in 
micro-fabrication  techniques,  such  as  new  lithography  and  etching  techniques,  precision  micro-
molds,  and  improved  laser  cutting  and  chipping  tools,  have  simplified MEMS  development  and 
extended their capabilities. 

The  Lorentz  force  law  (6.2.1)  is  fundamental  to  all  electric  and  magnetic  motors  and 
generators  and  expresses  the  force  vector  f  [Newtons]  acting  on  a  charge  q  [Coulombs]  as  a 
function of the local electric field  E , magnetic field  H , and charge velocity vector  v  [ms-1]: 

f

q E( + v × μo H )  [Newtons]
= 

(6.2.1) 

For  the  examples  in  Section  6.2  the  velocities  v   and  magnetic  fields H   are  negligible,  so  the 
force  is  primarily  electrostatic,  f
E  is 
qE ,  and  can  be  readily  found  if  E  is  known.  When 
= 
unknown,  the energy method of Section 5.4.2 can often be used  instead, as  illustrated  later.   The 
power  densities  achievable  in  MEMS  devices  can  be  quite  high,  and  are  typically  limited  by 
materials failures, such as electrical breakdown or ohmic overheating. 

6.2.2  Electrostatic actuators 

The  simplest  MEMS  actuators  use  the  electric  force  between  two  capacitor  plates  to  pull  them 
together,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6.2.1(a)  for  a  cantilevered  loudspeaker  or  switch.    The  Lorentz 
force  density  F  [N  m-2]  attracting  the  two  plates  is  given  by  the  qE   term  in  (6.2.1).    Although 
one  might  suppose  the  force  density  on  the  upper  plate  is  simply  ρsE,  where  ρs  is  the  surface 
charge  density  [C  m-2]  on  that  plate,  the  correct  force  is  half  this  value  because  those  charges 
nearer the surface screen those behind, as suggested in Figure 6.2.1(b); the charges furthest from 
the surface perceive almost no  E  at all.  The figure shows a one-to-one correspondence between 
electric  field  lines  and  charges  in  a  highly  idealized  distribution—reality  is  more  random.   The 
figure  shows  that  the  average  field  strength  E  perceived  by  the  charges  is  half  the  surface  field 
Eo, independent of their depth distribution ρ(z).  Therefore the total attractive electric pressure is: 

Pe  = ρs ( Eo  2 )  ⎣⎡Nm−2 ⎦⎤

(6.2.4) 

This is the same pressure derived more rigorously in (5.2.4) and (5.4.3).

If Eo  is  near  its  breakdown  value EB  ≅ 108  [V m-1]  for  gaps  less  than ~10-6 meters,  then  the 
 
2/2  ≅  8.8×10-12×1016/2  =  4.4×104  [N  m-2].  A  Newton  is  approximately  the 
pressure  P  =  εoEo
gravitational  force  on  the  apple  that  fell  on Newton’s  head  (prompting  his  theory  of  gravity),  or 
on  a  quarter-pound  of  butter.  Therefore  this  maximum  electrostatic  force  density  is  about  one 
pound per square centimeter, comparable to that of a strong magnet. 

The  cantilever  acts  like  a  spring  with  a  spring  constant  k,  so  the  total  force  f  is  simply 
related  to  the  deflection  x:  f  =  kx  =  PA,  where  A  is  the  area  of  the  capacitor  plate.   Thus  the 
deflection is: 

x PA k
= 

 = ε  E  2A  2k

 [
]
m 

(6.2.5)

The  ratio  A/k  is  controlled  by  the  composition,  thickness,  and  length  of  the  cantilever,  and  the 
desired deflection is controlled by the application.  For example, k must be adequate to overcome 
stiction19  in  switches  that  make  and  break  contact,  and  x  must  be  adequate  to  ensure  that  the 
voltage between the capacitor plates does not cause arcing when the switch is open. 

Alternatively  both  capacitor  plates  could  be  charged  positive  or  negative  so  they  repel  each 
other.  In  this  case  the  charge  Q  moves  to  the  outside  surfaces  and  connects  to  the  very  same 
field  strengths  as  before  due  to  boundary  conditions  (E  =  Q/εoA)  ,  except  that  the  negative 
pressure εoE2/2 on  the  two plates acts  to pull  them apart  rather  than  together.   The  field between 
the plates is then zero. 

19 Stiction  is  the  force  that must be overcome when  separating  two contacting surfaces.   These  forces often become 
important for micron-sized objects, particularly for good conductors in contact for long periods.

Even  with  extreme  electric  field  strengths  the  power  density  [W  m-3]  available  with  linear 
motion  MEMS  actuators  may  be  insufficient.    Power  equals  force  times  velocity,  and  rotary 
velocities  can  be much  greater  than  linear  velocities  in  systems  with  limited  stroke,  such  as  the 
cantilever of Figure 6.2.1(a) or the lateral-displacement systems illustrated in Figure 6.2.2.  Since 
it  is  difficult  to  compute  the  lateral  electric  fields  responsible  for  the  lateral  forces  in  rotary  or 
linear  systems  [e.g.,  the  z  components  in  Figure  6.2.2(a)],  the  energy  methods  described  below 
are generally used instead.

The  two  charged parallel plates  illustrated  in Figure 6.2.2(a)  are pulled  laterally  toward one 
another  (z  increases)  because  opposite  charges  attract.  The  force⎯f  required  to  pull  the  plates 
apart depends only on their electric charge q and the plate geometry, independent of any attached 
circuit.    This  force⎯f  in  the  -z  direction  can  be  found  by  noting  that  f  does  work  on  the 
capacitor/circuit system, increasing its total energy wT if f is positive: 

f = - dwT/dz = - dwe/dz - V dq/dz  [N] 

(energy-force equation) 

(6.2.6) 

where  we  is  the  electric  energy  stored  in  the  capacitor,  V  is  the  capacitor  voltage20,  and  dq  is 
incremental  charge  flowing  from  any  attached  circuit  into  the  positive  terminal  of  the  capacitor. 
The  negative  sign  in  (6.2.6)  results  because  f  is  in  the  -z  direction.    Since  this  energy-force 
equation  is  correct  regardless  of  any  attached  circuit,  we  can  evaluate  it  for  an  attached  open 
circuit,  battery,  or  arbitrary  Thevenin  equivalent,  provided  it  results  in  the  given  capacitor 
voltage V and charge q. 

The  force  computed  using  (6.2.6)  is  the  same  for  any  attached  circuit  and  any  form  of  the 
energy expression (3.1.16): 

we = CV2/2 = q2/2C  [J] 

(electric energy in a capacitor) 

(6.2.7) 

The  algebra  is  minimized,  however,  if  we  assume  the  capacitor  is  open-circuit  so  that  q  is 
constant and dq/dz = 0  in  (6.2.6).   Because V depends on z  in  this case,  it  is simpler  to use we = 
q2/2C to evaluate (6.2.6), where: 1) C = εoWz/s [F], 2) the overlap area of the capacitor is Wz, 3) 
the plate separation is s << W, and 4) we neglect fringing fields.  Thus (6.2.6) becomes: 

f = - (q2/2) (dC-1/dz) = - (q2/2)(s/εoW)dz-1/dz = (q2/2)(s/εoWz2)  [N] 

(6.2.8) 

20 For convenience, V represents voltage and v represents velocity in this section. 

- 157 -


The rapid increase in force as z → 0 results because q is constant and concentrates at the ends of 
the  plates  as  the  overlap  approaches  zero;  z→0  also  violates  the  assumption  that  fringing  fields 
can be neglected. 

It is interesting to relate the force f of (6.2.8) to the electric field strength E, where: 

E = ρs/εo = q/Wzεo  [V m-1] 

q = WzεoE = WzεoV/s  [C]  	

(6.2.9) 

(6.2.10) 

f = q2s/2εoWz2 = WsεoE2/2 = A'Pe  [N] 

(lateral electric force) 

(6.2.11) 

where A' = Ws  is  the cross-sectional area of  the gap perpendicular  to⎯f, and Pe = ΔWe = εoE2/2 ­
0  is  the  electric  pressure  difference  acting  at  the  end  of  the  capacitor.   Note  that  this  pressure  is 
perpendicular to⎯E and is “pushing” into the adjacent field-free region where We = 0; in contrast, 
the  pressure  parallel  to⎯E  always  “pulls”.  Later  we  shall  find  that  “magnetic  pressure”  Pm  = 
ΔWm is similarly attractive parallel to⎯H and pushes in directions orthogonal to⎯H. 

Note that if V is constant, then the force f (6.2.11) does not depend on z and is maximized as 
s→0.  For  a  fixed  V,  the  minimum  practical  plate  separation  s  corresponds  to  E  near  the 
threshold of electrical breakdown, which is discussed further in Section 6.2.5.  Also note that the 
force  f  is  proportional  to  W,  which  can  be  maximized  using  multiple  fingers  similar  to  those 
illustrated  in  Figure  6.2.2(b).    Actuator  and  motor  designs  generally  maximize  f  and  W  while 
preserving the desired stroke21. 

Example 6.2A 
Design a small electrostatic overlapping plate linear actuator that opens a  latch by moving 1 mm 
with a force of 10-2 Newtons. 

Solution:	 The  two-plate  actuator  illustrated  in  Figure  6.2.2(a)  exerts  a  force  f  =  WsεoE2 
If  E  is  near  the  maximum  dry-gas  value  of  ~3.2×106  V  m-1,  the  gap 
(6.2.11). 
s  =  1  mm,  and W  =  1  cm,  then  f  =  10-2×10-3×8.85×10-12×1013  =  8.85×10-4  [N].  By 
using M  fingers,  each  wider  than  the  1-mm  stroke,  the  force  can  be  increased  by M 
[see Figure 6.2.2(b)].  If we  let M = 12  the device yields  f = 1.06×10-2, but  its  length 
L must  be  greater  than  12  times  twice  the  finger width  (see  figure), where  the  finger 
width  G  must  exceed  not  only  the  stroke  but  also  several  times  s,  in  order  to  make 
fringing fields negligible.  If G ≅ 4 mm,  then  the actuator  length  is 12×2×4 mm = 9.6 
cm,  large compared  to  the width.   A  three-plate actuator with  two grounded plates on 
the  outside  and  one  charged  plate  inside would  double  the  force,  halve  the  length  L, 
protect  users  from  electrocution,  and  simplify  sealing  the  actuator  against  moisture 

21
  The  “stroke”  of  an  actuator  is  its  range  of  positions;  in  Figure  6.2.2(a)  it  would  be  the  maximum  minus  the 
minimum value of z.  Although the force (6.2.11) becomes infinite as the minimum z → 0 for constant q, this would 
violate the assumption z >> d and can cause V→∞; V is usually held constant, however.

design is not unique, of course. 

6.2.3  Rotary electrostatic motors 

Because  forces  (6.2.4)  or  (6.2.11)  in  electrostatic  motors  are  limited  by  the  maximum  electric 
field  strength  E  possible  without  electric  arcing,  higher  power  densities  [W  m-3]  require  higher 
speeds since the power P = fv [watts], where f is force [N], and v is velocity [m s-1].  Figure 6.2.3 
pictures  an  ideal  4-segment  rotary  electrostatic  motor  for  which  v  and  the  resulting  centrifugal 
forces  are  ultimately  limited  by  the  tensile  strength  of  the  rotor.    For  both  materials  and 
aerodynamic  reasons  the maximum  v  at  the  rotor  tip  is  usually  somewhat  less  than  the  speed  of 
sound,  ~340  m/s.    Some  rotors  spin  much  faster  in  vacuum  if  the  material  can  withstand  the 
centrifugal force.

Figure 6.2.3  Four-segment rotary electrostatic motor. 
 

This  motor  has  radius  R,  plate  separation  s,  and  operating  voltage  V.    Stationary  “stator” 
plates  occupy  two  quadrants  of  the motor  and  a  second  pair  of  quadrant  plates  (the  “rotor”)  can 
rotate  to  yield  an  overlap  area  A  =  R2θ [m2]  that  varies  from  zero  to  πR2/2  as  θ  increases  from 
zero to π/2.  If the voltage V is applied across the plates, a torque T is produced22, where: 

T = −dw

(6.2.12) 

and dwT  is  the  increment by which  the  total  system energy  (fields plus battery)  is  increased as a 
result of the motion dθ.  The negative sign in (6.2.12) reflects the fact that the torque T is applied 
by  the  motor  to  the  environment.    If  we  replace  the  overlap  area  of  Wz  in  (6.2.8)  by  its 
equivalent R2θ, then (6.2.8) and (6.2.12) become:

22 Torque T [Nm] equals  the force f on a  lever  times  its  length L.   Therefore  the mechanical work performed by  the 
torque is wm = fx = fL(x/L) = Tθ, where θ = x/L is the angle (radians) through which the lever rotates about its pivot 
at one end.  Power is Tdθ/dt = Tω [W].

(6.2.14) 

where Q = εoR2θV/s [C], which follows from (6.2.10) where Wz → R2θ [m2]. 

If  we  assume  R  =  10-3,  s =  10-6,  and  V  =  3  volts  (corresponding  to  3×106  Vm-1,  below  the 
breakdown limit discussed in Section 6.2.5; then (6.2.14) yields: 

T = 8.8×10-12×(10-3)232/10-6  ≅ 7.9×10-11  [N m] 

(6.2.15) 

This  torque  exists  only  until  the  plates  fully  overlap,  at which  time  the  voltage V  is  switched  to 
zero until the plates coast another 90° and V is restored.  The duty cycle of this motor is thus 0.5 
because T ≠ 0 only half of the time. 

A  single  such  ideal  motor  can  then  deliver  an  average  of  Tω/2  watts,  where  the  factor  ½ 
reflects  the  duty  cycle,  and  Tω  is  the  mechanical  power  associated  with  torque  T  on  a  shaft 
rotating at ω radians s-1.  If the tip velocity v of this rotor is 300 ms-1, slightly less than the speed 
of  sound  so  as  to  reduce  drag  losses  while  maximizing  ω,  then  the  corresponding  angular 
velocity ω  is v/R = 300/10-3 = 3×105  radians  s-1 or ~3×106  rpm, and  the available power Tω/2 ≅ 
7.9×10-11  ×  3×105/2  ≅  1.2×10-5  watts  if  we  neglect  all  losses.    In  principle  one  might  pack 
~25,000  motors  into  one  cubic  centimeter  if  each  motor  were  10  microns  thick,  yielding 
~0.3 W/cm3.  By using a motor with N segments instead of 4 this power density and torque could 
be  increased by a factor of N/4.   The small micron-sized gap s would permit values of N as high 
as ~500 before the fringing fields become important, and power densities of ~40 W/cm-3. 

This  40-W/cm3  power  density  can  be  compared  to  that  of  a  200-hp  automobile  engine  that 
 
delivers 200×746 watts23 and occupies 0.1 m3, yielding only ~1.5 W/cm3.  Extremely high power 
densities  are  practical  only  in  tiny  MEMS  devices  because  heat  and  torque  are  then  easier  to 
remove,  and  because  only  micron-scale  gaps  permit  the  highest  field  strengths,  as  explained  in 
Section 6.2.5.  Rotary MEMS motors have great potential  for  extremely  low power  applications 
where  torque  extraction  can  be  efficient;  examples  include  drivers  for  micro-gas-turbines  and 
pumps.  The field of MEMS motors is still young, so their full potential remains unknown. 

6.2.4  Dielectric actuators and motors 

One difficulty with the rotary motor of Figure 6.2.3 is that voltage must be applied to the moving 
vanes across a sliding mechanical boundary.  One alternative is to use a dielectric rotor driven by 
voltages applied only to the stator.  The configuration could be similar to that of Figure 6.2.3 but 
the  rotor would  be  dielectric  and mounted  between  identical  conducting  stators with  a  potential 
V between them that is turned on and off at times so as to produce an average torque as the rotor 
rotates.  Figure 6.2.4 illustrates the concept in terms of a linear actuator for which the force f can 
more easily be found.  We again assume that fringing fields can be neglected because W >> d. 

23 There are 746 watts per horsepower.

The force f can be found by differentiating the total stored electric energy we with respect to 
motion z, where C is the effective capacitance of this structure, and: 

we =  CV2/2 = Q2/2C  [J] 

(6.2.16) 

To  simplify  differentiating  we  with  respect  to  z,  it  is  easier  to  use  the  expression  we  =  Q2/2C 
because is this case Q is independent of z whereas C is not. 

For  two  capacitors  in  parallel  C  =  Co  +  Cε  (3.1.14),  where  Co  and  Cε  are  the  capacitances 
associated  with  the  air  and  dielectric  halves  of  the  actuator,  respectively.    Capacitance  C  was 
defined  in  (3.1.8),  and  equals  εA/s  where  A  is  the  plate  area  and  s  is  the  plate  separation.    It 
follows that: 

C = Cε + Co = εzW/s + εo(L - z)W/s = [z(ε - εo) + εoL]W/s 

 

(6.2.17) 

The  force  f  pulling  the  dielectric  slab  between  the  charged  plates  is  given  by  the  force-
energy relation (6.2.6) and can be combined with (6.2.16) and (6.2.17) to yield:

This  force  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  electric  field  strength  E  between  the  two  plates  by 
substituting into (6.2.18) the expressions Q = CV and V = Es: 

 
(6.2.18) 

f ≅ (E2sW/2)(ε - εo) = [(ε - εo)E2/2]Ws = ΔPeA [N] 

(6.2.19) 

where  A  =  Ws  is  the  area  of  the  endface  of  the  dielectric  slab,  and  the  differential  electric 
pressure pulling the slab between the charged plates is: 

ΔPe = (ε - εo)E2/2  [Nm-2] 

(6.2.20) 

The  differential  pressure  ΔPe  pushing  the  interface  into  the  capacitor  is  thus  the  difference 
between  the  electric  pressure  on  one  side  of  the  dielectric  interface  and  that  on  the  other, where 
the pressure Pe on each side is simply the electric energy density there: 

- 161 -


Pe = εE2/2 	 [Nm-2], [Jm-3] 

(6.2.21) 

Because the electric field at the right-hand end of the slab approaches zero, it exerts no additional 
force.  Electric pressure is discussed further in Section 5.5.2. 

Applying  these  ideas  to  the  rotary motor of Figure 6.2.3 simply  involves  replacing  the  rotor 
by its dielectric equivalent and situating it between conducting stator plates that are excited by V 
volts  so  as  to  pull  each  dielectric  quadrant  into  the  space  between  them.   Then V  is  switched  to 
zero  as  the  dielectric  exits  that  space  so  the  rotor  can  coast  unpowered  until  the  dielectric 
quadrants  start  entering  the  next  pair  of  stator  plates.   Thus  the  drive  voltage V  is  non-zero  half 
the  time,  with  two  voltage  pulses  per  revolution  of  this  two-quadrant  rotor.    The  timing  of  the 
voltages  must  be  responsive  to  the  exact  position  of  the  rotor,  which  is  often  determined  by  a 
separate  rotor  angular  position  sensor.    Start-up  can  fail  if  the  rotor  is  in  exactly  the  wrong 
position where f = 0 regardless of V, and the rotor will spin backwards if it starts from the wrong 
position.    Figure  6.3.6  suggests  how  multiple  segments  and  excitation  phases  can  avoid  this 
problem in the context of magnetic motors. 

Example 6.2B 
Design  a  maximum-power-density  rotary  electrostatic  motor  that  delivers  10  W  power  at 
ω ≅ 106 r s-1 without make/break or sliding electrical contacts. 

Solution:  	 A  segmented  dielectric  rotor  sandwiched  between  charged  conducting  plates  avoids 
sliding electrical contacts.  Assume the rotor has radius R, thickness s, and is made of 
two  electrically  insulated  dielectrics  having  permittivities  ε  =  10εo  and  εo,  and  that 
they are radially segmented as is the rotor in Figure 6.2.3, but with M segments rather 
than  4.  The  maximum  pressure  on  the  edges  of  the  rotor  dielectric  boundaries 
between  ε  and  εo  is  ΔPe  =  (ε  - εo)E2/2  [N  m-2].  The  mechanical  power  delivered 
during  the half cycle  the voltages are applied  to  the plate  is Tω = 20 = ΔPe(R/2)sMω. 
Let’s  arbitrarily  set  s  =  10-6,  E  =  106  [V  m-1],  and  M  =  800.  Therefore  R  = 
2×20/(sMωΔPe)  =  40/[10-6×800×106×9×8.85×10-12×(106)2/2]  =  1.3×10-3  [m].    The 
operating voltage is Es ≅ 1 volt and the power density is ~105 W/cm3. 

6.2.5  Electrical breakdown 

In every case the torque or force produced by an electrostatic MEMS actuator or motor is limited 
by the breakdown field EB = VB/d, where VB is the breakdown voltage, and the dependence of EB 
on d is non-linear.  Electric breakdown of a gas occurs when stray free electrons accelerated by E 
acquire enough velocity and energy (a few electron volts24) to knock additional free electrons off 
gas  molecules  when  they  collide,  thus  triggering  a  chain  reaction  that  leads  to  arcing  and 
potentially  destructive  currents.   Water molecules  shed  electrons much more  easily  in  collisions 
than  do  nitrogen  or  oxygen  molecules,  and  so  EB  is  much  lower  in  moist  air.    This  is  why  it  is 
easier  to  draw  visible  sparks  in  cold  dry  winter  air  than  it  is  in  summer,  because  in  winter  the 

24 An electron volt  is  the energy acquired by an electron or other equally charged particle as  it accelerates  through a 
potential difference of one volt.  It is equivalent to e = 1.6021×10-19 Joules.

field strengths can be much greater before breakdown occurs, and such high-voltage breakdowns 
are more visible. 

If,  however,  the  gap  between  the  two  electrodes  is  sufficiently  small,  the  probability 
diminishes  that an  ionizing collision will occur between any  free electron and a gas atom before 
the  electron  hits  the  positively  charged  electrode.    This  mean-free-path,  or  average  distance 
before  a  “collision”,  for  free  electrons  is  on  the  order  of  one  micron  in  air,  so  breakdown  is 
inhibited  for  gaps  less  than  the mean  free  path.   However,  even when  the  gap  is  so  narrow  that 
gas breakdown  is unlikely,  if  the  field  strength E  is  increased  to ~3 × 108  [V m-1], or  two orders 
of magnitude beyond typical values for EB in dry gas, any free electrons can then acquire enough 
energy  to  knock  an  ion  loose  from  the  positively  charged  wall.    Such  a  positive  ion  can  then 
acquire enough energy to release multiple electrons when it impacts the negatively charged wall, 
producing another form of chain reaction, electrical arcing, and breakdown. 

The reasons electric actuators and motors are so attractive on the scale of MEMS, but almost 
never  used  at  larger  scales,  are  therefore  that:  1)  the  breakdown  field  strength  EB  increases 
approximately two orders of magnitude for micron-sized gaps, enabling force densities up to four 
orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  usual,  and  2)  enormous  values  for  E  and  pressure  can  be 
achieved with reasonable voltages across micron or sub-micron gaps (⇒ ~3×108 [V m-1] and ~10 
lb/cm2). 

The breakdown fields for materials are problematic because any local defect can concentrate 
field strengths locally, exceeding the threshold.  Fields of ~106 Vm-1 are a nominal upper bound, 
although somewhat higher values are obtained in integrated circuits.

Rotary magnetic motors 

6.3.1  Commutated rotary magnetic motors 

Most  electric motors  and generators  are  rotary because  their motion  can  then be  continuous  and 
high  velocity,  which  improves  power  density  and  efficiency  while  prolonging  equipment  life. 
Figure 6.3.1  illustrates an  idealized motor with a  rotor comprising a single  loop of wire carrying 
current  I  in  the  uniform  magnetic  field  H .  The  magnetic  field  can  originate  from  permanent 
magnets  in  the  stationary  stator,  which  is  the magnetic  structure  within  which  the  rotor  rotates, 
or from currents flowing  in wires wrapped around  the stator.   The rotor typically has many turns 
of  wire,  often  wrapped  around  a  steel  core  with  poles  that  nearly  contact  the  stator  along  a 
cylindrical surface. 

The  total  torque  (force  times  radius) on  the motor axle  is  found by adding  the contributions 
from  each  of  the  four  sides  of  the  current  loop;  only  the  longitudinal  elements  of  length  W  at 
radius  r  contribute,  however.    This  total  torque  vector T f = × r    is  the  integral  of  the  torque 
contributions  from  the  force density F acting on each  incremental  length ds of  the wire along  its 
entire contour C: 
T = (cid:118)∫C

In the special case where  H  is uniform over the coil area Ao = 2rW, we can define the magnetic 
moment M   of  the  coil,  where  | M |= IAo    and  where  the  vector  M  is  defined  in  a  right  hand 
sense relative to the current loop  I .  Then: 

T M × μo H 
= 

(6.3.4)

Because  the current flows only  in  the given direction, H  and  the  torque reverse as  the wire 
loop  passes  through  vertical  (θ =  nπ)  and  have  zero  average  value  over  a  full  rotation.    To 
achieve  positive  average  torque,  a  commutator  can  be  added,  which  is  a  mechanical  switch  on 
the rotor that connects one or more rotor windings with one or more stationary current sources in 
the  desired  sequence  and  polarity.    The  commutator  reverses  the  direction  of  current  at  times 
chosen  so  as  to  maximize  the  average  positive  torque.    A  typical  configuration  is  suggested  in 
Figure  6.3.2(a)  where  two  spring-loaded  carbon  brushes  pass  the  current  I  to  the  commutator 
contacts,  which  are  rigidly  attached  to  the  rotor  so  as  to  reverse  the  current  polarity  twice  per 
revolution.  This  yields  the  more  nearly  constant  torque  history  T(θ)  illustrated  by  the  dashed 
line  in  Figure  6.3.2(b).    In  this  approximate  analysis  of  a  DC  motor  we  assume  that  the  time

they move through  H .  For example, if the motor is open circuit (I ≡ 0), these electrons spinning 
about the rotor axis at velocity  v  will move along the wire due to the “ q v × μo H ” force on them 
until  they  have  charged  parts  of  that  wire  relative  to  other  parts  so  as  to  produce  a  “ qE ”  force 
that  balances  the  local magnetic  force,  producing  equilibrium  and  zero  additional  current.    Free 
electrons  in  equilibrium  have  repositioned  themselves  so  they  experience  no  net  Lorentz  force.

The  integral  of  E   from  one  end  of  the  conducting wire  to  the  other  yields  the  open-circuit

The  Thevenin  equivalent  circuits  representing  the  motor  and  its  external  circuit  determine

(6.3.9) 

When  the  motor  is  first  starting,  ω =  Φ  =  0  and  the  current  and  the  torque  are  maximum, 
where  Imax = Vs/(Rs + Rw).  The maximum  torque, or  “starting  torque”  from  (6.3.3), where Ao =

(6.3.10) 

As  the  motor  accelerates

Since  Φ  =  0  when  v

toward  its  maximum  ω,  the  back-voltage  Φ steadily  increases  until  it  equals  the  source  voltage 
Vs so  that  the net driving voltage, torque T, and current I → 0 at ω = ωmax.  Since (6.3.8) says Φ

where the relation to Tmax comes from (6.3.10), and ωmax occurs at Tmin. = 0.  At ωmax no power is 
being  converted,  so  the maximum motor  power  output  Pmax  occurs  at  an  intermediate  speed  ωp, 
as illustrated in Figure 6.3.4.

(6.3.12)

Equation (6.3.12) says that if Vs >> Φ, which occurs for modest values of ω, then the motor 
power increases linearly with Φ and ω.  Also, if Vs = 0, then Pm is negative and the device acts as 
a  generator  and  transfers  electrical  power  to  Rs  +  Rw  proportional  to  Φ2  and  therefore  ω2. 
Moreover,  if  we  differentiate  Pm  with  respect  to  Φ  and  set  the  result  to  zero,  we  find  that  the 
mechanical power  is greatest when Φ = Vs/2, which  implies ωp = ωmax/2.  In either  the motor or 
generator  case,  the  maximum  power  transfer  is  usually  limited  by  currents  overheating  the 
insulation or by high voltages causing breakdown.  Even when no power is transferred, the back-
voltage Φ could cause breakdown  if  the device spins too fast.   Semiconductor switches  that may 
fail before the motor insulation are increasingly replacing commutators so the risk of excessive ω 
is  often  a  design  issue.  In  an  optimum  motor  design,  all  failure  types  typically  occur  near  the 
same loading levels or levels of likelihood. 

Typical  parameters  for  a  commutated  2-inch  motor  of  this  type  might  be:  1)  B  =  μoH  = 
0.4  Tesla  (4000  gauss)  provided  by  permanent  magnets  in  the  stator,  2)  an  N  =  50-turn  coil  on 
the rotor with effective area A = 10-3N [m2], 3) Vs = 24 volts, and 4) Rs + Rw = 0.1 ohm.  Then it 
follows from (6.3.11), (6.3.12) for Φ = Vs/2, and (6.3.10), respectively, that: 

ωmax  = Vs  μ oHAN = 24 ( 0.4 ×10 −3 × 50 ) = 1200 [  rs -1

In  practice,  most  motors  like  that  of  Figure  6.3.1  wrap  the  rotor  windings  around  a  high 
permeability  core with  a  thin  gap  between  rotor  and  stator;  this maximizes H  near  the  current  I. 
Also, if the unit is used as an AC generator, then there may be no need for the polarity-switching 
commutator if the desired output frequency is simply the frequency of rotor rotation. 

Example 6.3A 
Design a commutated DC magnetic motor  that delivers maximum mechanical power of 1 kW at 
600 rpm.  Assume B = 0.2 Tesla and that the source voltage Vs = 50 volts. 

Solution:  Maximum mechanical  power  is  delivered  at ωp  = ωmax/2  (see  Figure  6.3.4).  Solving 
(6.3.13)  yields  NAo  =  Vs/(ωmaxμoH)  =  50/(2×600×60×2π×0.2)  =  5.53×10-4,  where 
ωmax  corresponds  to  1200  rpm.    If  N  =  6,  then  the  winding  area  2rW  =  Ao  ≅ 
1  cm2.      To  find  Imax  we  use  (6.3.14)  to  find  the  maximum  allowed  value  of 
Rs  +  Rw  =  (VsΦ  - Φ2)/Pm.  But  when  the  delivered  mechanical  power  Pmech  is 
maximum, Φ = Vs/2, so Rs + Rw = (50×25 - 252)/103 = 0.63Ω, which could  limit N  if 
the wire is too thin.  Imax = Vs/(Rs + Rw) = 50/0.63 = 80 [A].  The starting torque Tmax 
=  Imax(NAo)μoH  =  80(5.53×10-4)0.2  =  0.22  [N  m].    This  kilowatt  motor  occupies  a 
fraction of  a  cubic  inch  and may  therefore overheat because  the  rotor  is  small and  its 
thermal  connection  with  the  external  world  is  poor  except  through  the  axle.    It  is 
probably  best  used  in  short  bursts  between  cooling-off  periods.    The  I2Rw  thermal 
power dissipated in the rotor depends on the wire design. 

6.3.2  Reluctance motors 

Reluctance  motors  combine  the  advantages  of  rotary  motion  with  the  absence  of  rotor  currents 
and  the  associated  rotary  contacts.  Figure  6.3.5  suggests  a  simple  idealized  configuration  with 
only a single drive coil.

When  the  coil  is  energized  the  rotor  is  pulled  by  the  magnetic  fields  into  alignment  with  the 
magnetic  fields  linking  the  two  poles  of  the  stator,  where  μ >>  μo  in  both  the  rotor  and  stator. 
Reluctance motors must sense the angular position of the rotor, however, so the stator winding(s) 
can  be  excited  at  the  right  times  so  as  to  pull  the  passive  high-μ  rotor  toward  its  next  rotary 
position,  and  then  not  retard  it  as  it  moves  on  toward  the  following  attractive  position.    For 
example,  the  current  I  in  the  figure  will  pull  the  rotor  so  as  to  increase  θ,  which  is  the  overlap 
angle between the rotor and the stator poles.  Once the overlap is complete the current I would be 
set  to  zero  as  the  rotor  coasts  until  the  poles  again  have  θ ≅ 0  and  are  in  position  to  be  pulled 
forward  again  by  I.  Such  motors  are  efficient  if  hysteresis  losses  in  the  stator  and  rotor  are 
modest and the stator windings are nearly lossless. 

The torque on such a reluctance motor can be readily calculated using (6.2.12):

(6.3.16) 

The  total magnetic energy wT  includes wμ within  the rotor and stator, wg  in  the air gaps between 
them,  and  any  energy  in  the  power  supply  driving  the  motor.    Fortunately  we  can  simplify  the 
problem  by  noting  that  wg  generally  dominates,  and  that  by  short-circuiting  the  stator  the  same 
torque exists without any power source if I remains unchanged. 

NI

gap 

 

The circumstances  for which  the gap energy dominates  the  total energy wT are easily  found 
from the static integral form of Ampere’s law (1.4.1): 
= (cid:118)∫C ( Hgap  + Hstator  + H rotor ) • ds ≅ 2bH
 
To derive an approximate result we may assume the coil has N  turns,  the width of each gap  is b, 
and  the contour C  threads  the coil and  the  rest of  the motor over a distance ~2D, and  through an 
approximately  constant  cross-section A; D  is  the  rotor  diameter.   Since  the  boundary  conditions 
in  each  gap  require  B⊥  be  continuous,  μHμ ≅ μoHg,  where  Hμ ≅ Hstator  ≅ Hrotor  and  Hg  ≡ Hgap. 
The relative energies stored in the two gaps and the rotor/stator are:

Thus wg >> wμ  if  b/D  >>  μo/μ.  Since  gaps  are  commonly  b ≅  100 microns,  and  iron  or  steel  is 
often  used  in  reluctance motors, μ ≅ 3000,  so  gap  energy wg  dominates  if  the motor  diameter D

complex  because  both  energies  must  be  considered;  reluctance  motors  can  be  much  larger  than 
0.3 meters and still function. 

Under  the approximations wT  ≅ wg and A = gap area =  rθW, we may compute  the  torque T 
using (6.3.16) and (6.3.18):26

The  resulting  torque  T  in  (6.3.25)  can  be  interpreted  as  being  the  product  of  radius  r  and 
twice  the  force  exerted  at  the  leading  edge  of  each  gap  (twice,  because  there  are  two  gaps), 
2/2 [N m-2] times the gap area Wb projected on the 
where this force is the magnetic pressure μoHg
direction of motion.  Because the magnetic field  lines are perpendicular  to  the direction of force, 
the magnetic  pressure  pushes  rather  than  pulls,  as  it would  if  the magnetic  field were  parallel  to 
the direction of force.  Unfortunately, increasing the gap b does not increase the force, because it 
weakens  Hg  proportionately,  and  therefore  weakens  T  ∝  H2.  In  general,  b  is  designed  to  be 
minimum  and  is  typically  limited  to  roughly  25-100 microns  by  thermal  variations  and  bearing 
and manufacturing  tolerances.   The magnetic  field  in  the gap  is  limited by  the saturation  field of 
the magnetic material, as discussed in Section 2.5.4. 

The drive circuits  initiate  the current  I  in  the  reluctance motor of Figure 6.3.5 when  the gap 
area rθW is minimum, and terminate it when that area becomes maximum.  The rotor then coasts 
with  I  =  0  and  zero  torque  until  the  area  is  again  minimum,  when  the  cycle  repeats. 
Configurations  that  deliver  continuous  torque  are more  commonly  used  instead  because  of  their 
smoother performance. 

26 The  approximate dependence  (6.3.19) of wr/s upon A =  rθW breaks down when θ→0,  since wg doesn’t dominate 
then and (6.3.19) becomes approximate.

Figure 6.3.6  illustrates a  reluctance motor  that provides continuous  torque using  three stator 
poles (A, B, C) and four rotor poles (1, 2, 3, 4).   When windings A and B are excited, rotor pole 
1  is  pulled  clockwise  into  stator  pole  B.    The  gap  area  for  stator  pole A  is  temporarily  constant 
and  contributes  no  additional  torque.    After  the  rotor  moves  π/9  radians,  the  currents  are 
switched  to  poles  B  and  C  so  as  to  pull  rotor  pole  2  into  stator  pole  C,  while  rotor  pole  1 
contributes  no  torque.  Next  C  and  A  are  excited,  and  this  excitation  cycle  (A/B,  B/C,  C/A)  is 
repeated  six  times  per  revolution.    Counter-clockwise  torque  is  obtained  by  reversing  the 
excitation  sequence.    Many  pole  combinations  are  possible,  and  those  with  more  poles  yield 
higher torques because torque is proportional to the number of active poles.  In this case only one

A  calculation  very  similar  to  that  above  also  applies  to  relays  such  as  that  illustrated  in

The magnetic pressure  is attractive parallel  to  the  field  lines,  tending  to close  the gap.   The units 
N/m2 are identical to J/m3.  Note that the minus sign is used in (6.3.29) because f is the magnetic

direction reduces wg. 

Magnetic  micro-rotary  motors  are  difficult  to  build  without  using  magnetic  materials  or 
induction27 because it is difficult to provide reliable sliding electrical contacts to convey currents 
to  the  rotor.    One  form  of  rotary  magnetic  motor  is  similar  to  that  of  Figures  6.2.3  and  6.2.4, 
except that the motor pulls into the segmented gaps a rotating high-permeability material instead 
of  a  dielectric,  where  the  gaps  would  have  high  magnetic  fields  induced  by  stator  currents  like 
those  in Figure 6.3.6.   As  in  the case of  the  rotary dielectric MEMS motors discussed  in Section 
6.2,  the  timing  of  the  currents must  be  synchronized with  the  angular  position  of  the  rotor.   The 
force  on  a  magnetic  slab  moving  into  a  region  of  strong  magnetic  field  can  be  shown  to 
2/2  [N],  where  A  is  the  area  of  the  moving  face  parallel  to  Hμ,  which  is  the 
approximate  AμHμ 
field within the moving slab, and μ>>μo.  The rotor can also be made permanently magnetic so it 
is attracted or repelled by the synchronously switched stator fields; permanent magnet motors are 
discussed later in Section 6.5.2. 

Example 6.3B 
A  relay  like  that  of  Figure  6.3.7  is  driven  by  a  current  source  I  [A]  and  has  a  gap  of  width  g. 
What is the force f(g) acting to close the gap?  Assume  the cross-sectional area A of  the gap and 
metal  is constant around  the device, and note  the  force  is depends on whether  the gap  is open or

Linear magnetic motors and actuators 

6.4.1 

Solenoid actuators 

Compact  actuators  that  flip  latches  or  switches,  increment  a  positioner,  or  impact  a  target  are 
often  implemented  using  solenoids.    Solenoid  actuators  are  usually  cylindrical  coils  with  a 
slideably  disposed  high-permeability  cylindrical  core  that  is  partially  inserted  at  rest,  and  is 
drawn  into  the  solenoid  when  current  flows,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6.4.1.    A  spring  (not 
illustrated) often holds the core near its partially inserted rest position.

If we  assume  the diameter of  the  solenoid  is  small  compared  to  its  length,  then  the  fringing 
fields  at  the  ends  of  the  coil  and  core  can  be  neglected  relative  to  the  field  energy  stored 
elsewhere  along  the  solenoid.  If  we  integrate  H  along  contour  C1  (see  figure)  we  obtain  zero

of  H   using  the  Biot-Savart  law  (1.4.6)  also  yields  H 0   outside.  If  we  integrate  H  along

contour C2, which passes along the axis of the solenoid for unit distance, we obtain: 
(cid:118)∫C2
where No  is defined as  the number of  turns of wire per meter of  solenoid  length.   We obtain  the 
same  answer  (6.4.2)  regardless  of  the  permeability  along  the  contour  C2,  provided  we  are  not 
near  the  ends  of  the  solenoid  or  its moveable  core.   For  example,  (6.4.2)  also  applies  to  contour 
C3, while the integral of⎯H around C4 is zero because the encircled current there is zero.

(6.4.2) 

Since (6.4.2) requires that Hz along  the solenoid axis be approximately constant, Bz must be 
a  factor  of μ/μo  greater  in  the  permeable  core  than  it  is  in  the  air-filled  portions  of  the  solenoid. 
Because  boundary  conditions  require  B⊥    to  be  continuous  at  the  core-air  boundary,  H⊥   must 
be discontinuous there so that μHμ = μoHo, where Hμ and Ho are the axial values of H in the core 
and  air,  respectively.  This  appears  to  conflict  with  (6.4.2),  which  suggests  H  inside  the 
solenoid  is  independent of μ, but  this applies only  if we neglect fringing fields at  the ends of  the 
solenoid  or  near  boundaries  where  μ  changes.  Thus  the  axial  H  varies  approximately  as 
suggested in Figure 6.4.1(b): it has a discontinuity at the boundary that relaxes toward constant H 
=  NoI  away  from  the  boundary  over  a  distance  comparable  to  the  solenoid  diameter.    Two 
representative  field  lines  in  Figure  6.4.1(a)  suggest  how⎯B  diverges  strongly  at  the  end  of  the 
magnetic  core  within  the  solenoid  while  other  field  lines  remain  roughly  constant  until  they 
diverge at the right end of the solenoid.  The transition region between the two values of Bz at the 
end of the solenoid occurs over a distance roughly equal to the solenoid diameter, as suggested in 
Figure  6.4.1(b).  The magnetic  field  lines⎯B  and⎯H  "repel"  each  other  along  the  protruding  end 
of  the high permeability  core on  the  left  side of  the  figure,  resulting  in  a nearly  linear decline  in 
magnetic  field  within  the  core  there;  at  the  left  end  of  the  core  there  is  again  a  discontinuity  in 
|Hz| because⎯B⊥ must be continuous. 

Having  approximated  the  field  distribution we  can  now  calculate  energies  and  forces  using 
the  expression  for  magnetic  energy  density,  Wm  =  μH2/2  [J  m-3].    Except  in  the  negligible 
fringing field regions at the ends of  the solenoid and at  the ends of  its core,  |H| ≅ NoI (6.4.2) and 
μH2  >>  μoH2,  so  to  simplify  the  solution we  neglect  the  energy  stored  in  air  as we  compute  the 
magnetic force fz pulling on the core in the +z direction: 

f z  = −dw

T  dz

 

[N] 
 

(6.4.3) 

The energy  in  the core  is confined  largely  to  the  length z within  the solenoid, which has a cross-
sectional area A [m2].  The total magnetic energy wm thus approximates: 

μH 2  2  [J] 
w m  ≅ Az
 

(6.4.4) 

If we assume wT = wm and differentiate  (6.4.4) assuming H  is  independent of z, we  find  the 
magnetic  force  expels  the  core  from  the  solenoid,  the  reverse of  the  truth.   To obtain  the  correct 
answer we must differentiate the total energy wT in the system, which includes any energy in the

power source supplying the current I.  To avoid considering a power supply we may alternatively 
assume  the  coil  is  short-circuited  and  carrying  the  same  I  as  before.    Since  the  instantaneous 
force  on  the  core  depends  on  the  instantaneous  I  and  is  the  same whether  it  is  short-circuited  or 
connected to a power source, we may set: 

v = 0 = dΛ/dt

pressure μH2/2  [Nm-2] we  saw  in  (6.3.25), but  this  time  the magnetic  field  is pulling on  the core 
in  the  direction  of  the  magnetic  field  lines,  whereas  before  the  magnetic  field  was  pushing 
perpendicular to the field lines.  This pressure equals the magnetic energy density Wm, as before. 
A  slight  correction  for  the  non-zero  influence  of  μo  and  associated  small  pressure  from  the  air 
side  could  be  made  here,  but  more  exact  answers  to  this  problem  generally  also  require 
consideration of the fringing fields and use of computer tools. 

It  is  interesting  to note how  electric  and magnetic pressure  [N/m2]  approximates  the  energy 
density  [J m-3] stored  in  the  fields, where we have neglected  the pressures applied  from  the  low-
field side of  the boundary when ε >> εo or μ >> μo.  We have now seen examples where  E  and 
H  both  push  or  pull  on  boundaries  from  the  high-field  (usually  air)  side  of  a  boundary,  where 
both  E  and  H  pull in the direction of their field lines, and push perpendicular to them.

6.4.2  MEMS magnetic actuators 

One form of magnetic MEMS switch is illustrated in Figure 6.4.2.  A control current I2 deflects a 
beam  carrying  current  I1.  When  the  beam  is  pulled  down  toward  the  substrate,  the  switch  (not 
shown)  will  close,  and  when  the  beam  is  repelled  upward  the  switch  will  open.  The  Lorentz 
force  law  (1.2.1)  states  that  the magnetic  force  f  on  a  charge  q  is  q v × μo H ,  and  therefore  the 
force  density  per  unit  length  F  [N  m-1]  on  a  current  I1 = Nq v  induced  by  the  magnetic  field 
H12  at position 1 produced by I2 is: 

F Nq v

(6.4.11) 

N  is  the number of moving charges per meter of conductor length, and we assume that all forces 
on these charges are conveyed directly to the body of the conductor.

If  the  plate  separation  d  <<  W,  then  fringing  fields  can  be  neglected  and  the  I2-induced 
magnetic  field  affecting  current  I1  is  H12 ,  which  can  be  found  from  Ampere’s  law  (1.4.1) 
computed for a contour C circling I2 in a right-hand sense: 
H ds ≅ H12 2W = (cid:119)∫∫ A

(6.4.12)

Thus  H12  ≅  zˆI2  2W .  The upward pressure on  the upper beam  found  from  (6.4.11) and  (6.4.12) 
is then: 

I I  2W 2  ⎡⎣ N m−2 ⎤⎦ 
P F W ≅ μxˆ  o 1 2

(6.4.13)

If  I1  =  -I2  then  the  magnetic  field  between  the  two  closely  spaced  currents  is  Ho ′  =  I1/W  and 
(6.4.13)  becomes  p = μoH o  2  [N  m-2];  this  expression  for  magnetic  pressure  is  derived 
xˆ
' 2
differently in (6.4.15). 

This pressure on  the  top  is downward  if both currents  flow  in  the  same direction, upward  if 
they are opposite, and zero  if either  is zero.  This device  therefore can perform a variety of  logic 
functions.  For  example,  if  a  switch  is  arranged  so  its  contacts  are  closed  in  state  “1”  when  the 

- 176 -


beam  is forced upward by both I1 and I2 being positive (these currents were defined  in  the figure 
as flowing in opposite directions), and not otherwise, this is an “and” gate. 

An  alternate  way  to  derive  magnetic  pressure  (6.4.13)  is  to  note  that  if  the  two  currents  I1 
and  I2  are  anti-parallel,  equal,  and  close  together  (d  <<  W),  then  H 0 outside  the  two

conductors  and Ho'  is  doubled  in  the  gap  between  them  so WHo' =  I1.  That  is,  if  the  integration 
contour C circles either current alone then (6.4.12) becomes:

But  not  all  electrons  comprising  these  currents  see  the  same magnetic  field  because  the  currents 
closer  to  the  two  innermost  conductor  surfaces  screen  the  outer  currents,  causing  the  magnetic 
field to approach zero inside the conductors, as suggested in Figure 6.4.3.

Therefore  the  average  moving  electron  sees  a  magnetic  field  Ho'/2,  half  that  at  the  surface28. 
Thus the total magnetic pressure upward on the upper beam given by (6.4.13) and (6.4.14) is:

pressure [N m-2] equals  the magnetic energy density [J m-3] stored  in  the magnetic field adjacent 
to the conductor (2.7.8).

Permanent magnet devices 

6.5.1 

Introduction 

A  permanent  magnet  (Section  2.5.4)  has  a  residual  flux  density Br   when  H 0= 
  inside  it,  and 
this  is  the  rest  state  of  an  isolated  permanent magnet.    In  this  case  the magnetic  energy  density 
2
inside  is  Wm = • H 2 = 0 , and  that outside,  Wm  = μo
B 
≠ 0 .  Boundary conditions  (2.6.5)  say
H 
Br ⊥  = μo H o ⊥ ,  where  Ho⊥  is  the  boundary  value  in  air.   Since  H //  is  continuous  across  an 
insulating boundary and  H r  = 0  inside a resting permanent magnet,  Ho //  = 0  too.  If an external 
H   is  applied  to  a  permanent magnet,  then  B  within  that magnet  is  altered  as  suggested  by  the 
hysteresis diagram in Figure 2.5.3(b). 

The  force  f  [N] attracting a permanent magnet  to a high-permeability material can be  found 
using: 

f

dw  m  dx
= 

 

(6.5.1)

where  x  is  the  separation  between  the  two,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6.5.1,  and  wm  is  the  total 
energy  in  the  magnetic  fields  [J].    The  changing  magnetic  energy  in  the  high-permeability 
material  is negligible  compared  to  that  in  air because: 1) boundary  conditions  require  continuity 
in  B⊥   across the boundary so that  B⊥  = μH⊥  = μo H o ⊥ , and therefore H⊥/Ho⊥ = μo/μ << 1, and 
2) Wm [Jm-3] = μ
H  2/2 where μ >> μo; thus the energy density in air is greater by ~μ/μo >> 1.

The variable magnetic energy is dominated by the energy wm in the gap, which is the energy 
2/2, times the volume of the gap Ax, where A is the area of the magnet face 
density, Wm = μoHgap
and x is the gap width.  Thus:

(6.5.2) 

Differentiating wm with  respect  to x yields  the attractive  force  f ≅ μoHgap

2  2μ ⎡ J m−3 
2  2 = Wgap  = Bgap 
⎦⎤ 
F ≅ μoHgap 
o  ⎣ 

(6.5.3)

This can be expressed in terms of B:  =  gap  2μo  [Nm-2].  Note that the rest energy density 
F B2
inside  the  permanent  magnet  is  zero,  so  it  exerts  no  pressure.  Most  permanent  magnets  have 
magnetic flux densities B less than one Tesla (104 gauss), so a magnet this powerful with an area 
A  =  10  cm2  (~the  size  of  a  silver  dollar)  would  therefore  apply  an  attractive  force  AF  = 
0.001×12/2×4π10-7  ≅ 400N (~100 pound force).  A more typical permanent magnet the same size 
might attract a steel surface with only a 10–20 pound force. 

If  two  equal  coin-shaped  permanent  magnets  are  stacked  so  they  stick  together,  then  they 
2/2μo  [Nm-2]  associated  with  the  gap 
experience  primarily  the  attractive  magnetic  pressure  Bgap
between them, and are bonded with approximately the same force density as if one of them were 
merely a high-permeability sheet.  In this case  Bgap  ≅ B r  , as shown in Figure 2.5.3(b). 

This  simple  gap-based  magnetic  pressure  model  does  not  explain  the  repulsive  force 
between  two such coin magnets when one  is flipped, however, for  then Hg  ≅ 0  and wgap  ≅ 0 for 
all  small  values  of  x,  and  dwg/dx  is  also  ~0.  In  this  case  the  energy  of  interest  wT  lies  largely 
inside  the magnets.   This  special  case  illustrates  the  risks of  casually  substituting  simple models 
for  the  underlying  physical  reality  captured  in Maxwell’s  equations,  the  Lorentz  force  law,  and 
material characteristics. 

Permanent magnets  fail  above  their Curie  temperature when  the magnetic domains become 
scrambled.    Cooling  overheated  permanent  magnets  in  a  strong  external  magnetic  field  usually 
restores  them.    Some  types  of  permanent  magnets  can  also  fail  at  very  low  temperatures,  and 
should not be used where that is a risk. 

6.5.2 

Permanent magnet motors 

Compact  high-power-density  motors  often  incorporate  permanent  magnets  so  current  is  not 
wasted  on  maintenance  of  H .  For  example,  the  stator  for  the  rotary  single-turn  coil  motor  of 
Figure  6.3.1  could  easily  contain  permanent  magnets,  avoiding  the  need  for  current  excitation. 
Moreover, modern permanent magnets can provide quite  intense  fields, above 0.5 Tesla.    In  this 
case  we  should  also  consider  the  effect  of  the  rotor  currents  on  the  stator  permanent  magnets, 
whereas  in  the  earlier  example we  considered  the  stator  fields  and  rotor  currents  as  given.    The 

- 179 -


incremental  permeability  of  a  permanent  magnet  varies  with  the  applied  H.    If  H  is  oriented  to 
attract  the  stator pole and μoH > Br,  then B  in  the permanent magnet will  increase above Br  (see 
Figure  2.5.3), where  the  incremental  permeability  approaches μo.  To  the  extent  the  incremental 
μ > μo, some reluctance-motor torque will supplement the dominant torque studied earlier. 

The permanent magnets can alternatively be placed on  the rotor, avoiding  the need for rotor 
currents  or  a  commutator,  provided  the  stator  currents  are  synchronously  switched  instead. 
Clever  electronics  can  detect  the  voltage  fluctuations  in  the  stator  induced  by  the  rotor  and  thus 
deduce  its  position,  potentially  avoiding  the  need  for  a  separate  expensive  angle  encoder  for 
stator current synchronization. 

Because different parts of permanent magnets  see different B/H histories,  and  these depend 
in  part  on  B/H  histories  elsewhere  in  the  device,  modern  design  of  such  motors  or  generators 
relies extensively on complex software tools for modeling support. 

Example 6.5A 
Two  identical  coin-shaped  permanent  magnets  of  12-cm  diameter  produce  0.05  Tesla  field 
perpendicular  to  their  flat  faces;  one  side  is  the  north  pole  of  the magnet  and  the  other  is  south. 
What is the maximum force f attracting the magnets when placed face to face? 

Solution:  Using (6.5.3) yields f = ABgap

2/2μo = π(0.06)2(0.05)2/(2×1.26×10-6) = 11.2 [N].

Electric and magnetic sensors 

6.6.1  Electrostatic MEMS sensors 

Sensors  are  devices  that  respond  to  their  environment.    Some  sensors  alter  their  properties  as  a 
function  of  the  chemical,  thermal,  radiation,  or  other  properties  of  the  environment,  where  a 
separate  active  circuit  probes  these  properties.    The  conductivity,  permeability,  and  permittivity 
of materials are  typically sensitive  to multiple environmental parameters.   Other sensors directly 
generate  voltages  in  response  to  the  environment  that  can  be  amplified  and  measured.    One 
common MEMS  sensor  measures  small  displacements  of  cantilevered  arms  due  to  temperature, 
pressure, acceleration, chemistry, or other changes.  For example, temperature changes can curl a 
thin  cantilever  due  to  differences  in  thermal  expansion  coefficient  across  its  thickness,  and 
chemical  reactions  on  the  surface  of  a  cantilever  can  change  its mass  and mechanical  resonance 
frequency.  Microphones can detect vibrations in such cantilevers, or accelerations along specific 
axes. 

Figure 6.6.1 portrays a standard capacitive MEMS sensor that illustrates the basic principles, 
where  the  capacitor  plates  of  area  A  are  separated  by  the  distance  d,  and  the  voltage  V  is 
determined  in  part  by  the  voltage  divider  formed  by  the  source  resistance  Rs  and  the  amplifier 
input resistance R.  Vs is the source voltage.

amplifier,  then  that  sensor  can  detect  as  little  as  ΔwΒ ≅ 10-20  joules  per  “bit  of  information”30. 
This  can  be  compared  to  the  incremental  increase  Δwc  in  capacitor  energy  due  to  the 
displacement δ << d as C decreases to C':

A simple example illustrates the extreme potential sensitivity of such a sensor.  Assume the plate 
separation  d  is  one  micron,  the  plates  are  1-mm  square  (A  =  10-6),  and  V  =  300.  Then  the 
minimum detectable δ given by (6.6.1) for Δwc = ΔwΒ = 10-20 Joules is:

At  this potential  level of  sensitivity we  are  limited  instead by  thermal  and mechanical noise due 
to  the  Brownian  motion  of  air  molecules  and  conduction  electrons.    A  more  practical  set  of 
parameters might  involve  a  less  sensitive  detector  (ΔB  ≅ 10-14)  and  lower  voltages  (V ≅ 5);  then 
δmin  ≅ 10-10 meters ≅ 1 angstrom (very roughly an atomic diameter).   The dynamic range of such 
a sensor would be enormously greater, of course.  This one-angstrom sensitivity is comparable to 
that of the human eardrum at ~1kHz. 

29 The resistance R of two resistors in parallel is R = (Ra  (cid:38) Rb) = RaRb/(Ra + Rb). 
30 Most good communications systems can operate with acceptable probabilities of error  if Eb/No >~10, where Eb  is 
the  energy  per  bit  and  No  =  kT  is  the  noise  power  density  [W  Hz-1]  =  [J].  A  bit  is  a  single  yes-no  piece  of 
information.    Boltzmann's  constant  k  ≅  1.38×10-23  [J  oK-1],  and  T  is  the  system  noise  temperature,  which  might 
approximate  100K  in  a  good  system  at  RF  frequencies.    Thus  the  minimum  energy  required  to  detect  each  bit  of 
information is ~10No  = 10 kT ≅ 10-20 [J].

An  alternative  to  such  observations  of  MEMS  sensor  voltage  transients  is  to  observe 
changes  in  resonant  frequency  of  an  LC  resonator  that  includes  the  sensor  capacitance;  this 
approach can reduce the effects of low-frequency interference. 

6.6.2  Magnetic MEMS sensors 

Microscopic magnetic  sensors  are  less  common  than  electrostatic  ones  because  of  the  difficulty 
of  providing  strong  inexpensive  reliable  magnetic  fields  at  microscopic  scales.    High  magnetic 
fields  require  high  currents  or  strong  permanent  magnets.    If  such  fields  are  present,  however, 
mechanical  motion  of  a  probe  wire  or  cantilever  across  the  magnetic  field  lines  could  produce 
fluctuating voltages, as given by (6.1.4). 

6.6.3  Hall effect sensors 

Hall  effect  sensors  are  semiconductor  devices  that  produce  an  output  voltage  VHall  proportional 
to  magnetic  field  H ,  where  the  voltage  is  produced  as  a  result  of  magnetic  forces  on  charge 
carriers moving at velocity  v  within the semiconductor.  They can measure magnetic fields or, if 
the magnetic field is known, can determine the average velocity and type (hole or electron) of the 
charge carriers conveying current.  A typical configuration appears in Figure 6.6.2, for which the 
Hall-effect  voltage  VHall  is  proportional  to  the  current  I  and  to  the  perpendicular magnetic  field 
H .

The operation of a Hall-effect sensor follows directly from the Lorentz force law:

Positively charged carriers moving at velocity  v  would be  forced downward by  f , as shown  in 
the  figure,  where  they  would  accumulate  until  the  resulting  electric  field  E  provided  a 
sufficiently  strong  balancing  force  qE  in  the  opposite  direction  to  produce  equilibrium.   In 
equilibrium  the  net  force  and  the  right-hand  side  of  (6.6.3) must  be  zero,  so  E 
and

the resulting VHall is:

For  charge  carrier  velocities  of  30 m  s-1  and  fields μoH  of  0.1 Tesla, VHall would  be  3 millivolts 
across a width W of one millimeter, which is easily detected. 

If  the  charge  carriers  are  electrons  so  q  <  0,  then  the  sign  of  the  Hall  voltage  is  reversed. 
Since  the  voltage  depends  on  the  velocity  v  of  the  carriers  rather  than  on  their  number,  their 
average number density N [m-1] can be determined using I = Nqv.  That is, for positive carriers:

Thus  the  Hall  effect  is  useful  for  understanding  carrier  behavior  (N,v)  as  a  function  of

7.1 

TEM waves on structures 

7.1.1 

Introduction 

Transmission  lines  typically  convey  electrical  signals  and  power  from  point  to  point  along 
arbitrary paths with high efficiency, and can also serve as circuit elements.  In most transmission 
lines,  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  point  purely  transverse  to  the  direction  of  propagation; 
such waves are called  transverse electromagnetic or TEM waves, and such  transmission  lines are 
called  TEM  lines.  The  basic  character  of TEM waves  is  discussed  in  Section  7.1,  the  effects  of 
junctions are introduced in Section 7.2, and the uses and analysis of TEM lines with junctions are 
treated in Section 7.3.  Section 7.4 concludes by discussing TEM lines that are terminated at both 
ends so as to form resonators. 

Transmission  lines  in  communications  systems  usually  exhibit  frequency-dependent 
behavior, so complex notation is commonly used.  Such lines are the subject of this chapter.  For 
broadband  signals  such  as  those  propagating  in  computers,  complex  notation  can  be  awkward 
and  the  physics  obscure.  In  this  case  the  signals  are  often  analyzed  in  the  time  domain,  as 
introduced  in  Section  7.1.2  and  discussed  further  in  Section  8.1.    Non-TEM  transmission  lines 
are commonly called waveguides; usually the waves propagate inside some conducting envelope, 
as  discussed  in  Section  9.3,  although  sometimes  they  propagate  partly  outside  their  guiding 
structure in an “open” waveguide such as an optical fiber, as discussed in Section 12.2. 

7.1.2  TEM waves between parallel conducting plates 

The  sinusoidal  uniform  plane  wave  of  equations  (7.1.1)  and  (7.1.2)  is  consistent  with  the 
presence of thin parallel conducting plates orthogonal to the electric field  E(z, t ) , as illustrated in 
Figure 7.1.1(a)31. 

E(z, t )  = xE  o cos(  ωt − kz)   [V/m]

H(z, t ) = yˆ

(7.1.2) 

Although perfect consistency requires that the plates be infinite, there is approximate consistency 
so  long  as  the  plate  separation  d  is  small  compared  to  the  plate width W  and  the  fringing  fields 
(
) = xˆE x (z − ct  ) , 
 
outside 
the  structure  are  negligible. 
The  more  general  wave  E z,t

cases  all  boundary  conditions  of  Section  2.6  are  satisfied  because  E //  = H⊥ = 0  at  the

conductors.  The  voltage  between  two  plates  v(z,t)  for  this  sinusoidal  wave  can  be  found  by 
integrating  E ( z, t )   over  the  distance  d  from  the  lower  plate,  which  we  associate  here  with  the 
voltage +v, to the upper plate:

Although this computed voltage v(t,z) does not depend on the path of integration connecting 
the  two  plates,  provided  it  is  at  constant  z,  it  does  depend  on  z  itself.    Thus  there  can  be  two 
different voltages between the same pair of plates at different positions z.  Kirchoff’s voltage law 
says  that  the sum of voltage drops around a loop is zero; this law is violated here because such a 
loop  in  the  x-z  plane  encircles  time  varying magnetic  fields,  H ( z, t  ,  as  illustrated.    In  contrast, 
) 
the sum of voltage drops around a loop confined to constant z is zero because it circles no  ∂H t∂ 
;  therefore  the  voltage  v(z,t),  computed  by  integrating  E z( )   between  the  two  plates,  does  not 
depend  on  the  path  of  integration  at  constant  z.    For  example,  the  integrals  of  E ds along
•
contours A and B in Figure 7.1.1(b) must be equal because the integral around the loop 1, 2, 4, 3, 
1 is zero and the path integrals within the perfect conductors both yield zero. 

If the electric and magnetic fields are zero outside the two plates and uniform between them, 
then  equal  and  opposite  currents  i(t,z)  flow  in  the  two  plates  in  the  ±z  direction.  The  surface 
current  is  determined  by  the  boundary  condition  (2.6.17):  Js  = nˆ × H  [A  m-1].    If  the  two 
conducting plates are spaced close together compared to their widths W so that d << W, then the 
fringing  fields  at  the plate  edges  can be neglected  and  the  total  current  flowing  in  the plates  can

If  the  integration  contour C  encircles  the  lower  plate  and  surface A  at  constant  z  in  a  clockwise 
(right-hand) sense with  respect  to  the +z axis as  illustrated  in Figure 7.1.1,  then  Dinˆ = 0  and  the 
current flowing in the +z direction in the lower plate is simply:

(7.1.5)

An equal and opposite current flows in the upper plate. 

Note that the computed current does not depend on the integration contour C chosen so long 
as C circles the plate at constant z.  Also, the current flowing into a section of conducting plate at 
z1  does  not  generally  equal  the  current  flowing  out  at  z2,  seemingly  violating Kirchoff’s  current 
law (the sum of currents flowing  into a node  is zero).   This inequality exists because any section 
of  parallel  plates  exhibits  capacitance  that  conveys  a  displacement  current  D t
∂   between  the 
∂
two  plates;  the  right-hand  side  of  Equation  (2.1.6)  suggests  the  equivalent  nature  of  the 
conduction current density  J  and the displacement current density  D t .
∂
∂

Such  a  two-conductor  structure  conveying waves  that  are  purely  transverse  to  the  direction 
of  propagation,  i.e.,  Ez  =  Hz  =  0,  is  called  a  TEM  transmission  line  because  it  is  propagating 
transverse  electromagnetic  waves  (TEM  waves).  Such  lines  generally  have  a  physical  cross-
section  that  is  independent of z.   This particular TEM  transmission  line  is called a parallel-plate 
TEM line. 

Because  there  are  no  restrictions  on  the  time  structure  of  a  plane  wave,  any  v(t)  can 
propagate  between  parallel  conducting  plates.  The  ratio  between  v(z,t)  and  i(z,t)  for  this  or  any 
other  sinusoidal  or  non-sinusoidal  forward  traveling wave  is  the  characteristic  impedance  Zo  of 
the TEM structure: 

v (

)
z, t  

( 
) 
i   z, t   = ηod  W  = Zo  [  ohms  ]  

(characteristic impedance) 

(7.1.6)

In  the  special  case  d  =  W,  Zo  equals  the  characteristic  impedance  ηo  of  free  space,  377  ohms. 
Usually W >> d in order to minimize fringing fields, yielding Zo << 377. 

Since  the  two  parallel  plates  can  be  perfectly  conducting  and  lossless,  the  physical 
significance of Zo ohms may be unclear.   Zo  is defined as  the  ratio of  line voltage  to  line current 
for  a  forward  wave  only,  and  is  non-zero  because  the  plates  have  inductance  L  per  meter 
associated  with  the  magnetic  fields  within  the  line.    The  value  of  Zo  also  depends  on  the 
capacitance C per meter of  this structure.   Section 7.1.3 shows (7.1.59)  that Zo = (L/C)0.5 for any 
lossless  TEM  line  and  (7.1.19)  shows  it  for  a  parallel-plate  line.    The  product  of  voltage  and 
current v(z,t)i(z,t)  represents power P(z,t)  flowing past any point z  toward  infinity;  this power  is 
not being converted to heat by resistive losses, it is simply propagating away without reflections. 

It  is  easy  to  demonstrate  that  the  power  P(z,t)  carried  by  this  forward  traveling wave  is  the 
same  whether  it  is  computed  by  multiplying  v  and  i,  or  by  integrating  the  Poynting  vector 
 [W m-2] over the cross-sectional area Wd of the TEM line:

The differential equations governing v and i on TEM lines are easily derived from Faraday’s

(7.1.9)

Because  all  but  one  term  in  the  curl  expressions  are  zero,  these  two  equations  are  quite  simple. 
By substituting v = Exd (7.1.3) and i = HyW (7.1.5), (7.1.8) and (7.1.9) become:

(7.1.10) 

(7.1.11) 

where  we  have  used  the  expressions  for  inductance  per  meter  L  [Hy  m-1]  and  capacitance  per 
meter  C  [F  m-1]  of  a  parallel-plate  TEM  line  [see  (3.2.11)32  and  (3.1.10)].  This  form  of  the 
differential equations  in  terms of L and C applies  to any  lossless TEM  line, as  shown  in Section 
7.1.3. 

These  two  differential  equations  can  be  solved  for  v  by  eliminating  i.   The  current  i  can  be 
eliminated  by  differentiating  (7.1.10)  with  respect  to  z,  and  (7.1.11)  with  respect  to  t,  thus 
introducing d2i/(dt dz) into both expressions permitting its substitution.  That is:

Wave  equations  relate  the  second  spatial  derivative  to  the  second  time  derivative  of  the 
same  variable,  and  the  solution  therefore  can  be  any  arbitrary  function  of  an  argument  that  has 
the same dependence on space as on  time, except for a constant multiplier.   That  is, one solution 
to (7.1.14) is: 

) = v+( z − ct  ) 
( 
v z, t  

(7.1.15)

where  v+  is  an  arbitrary  function  of  the  argument  ( −z ct )   and  is  associated  with  waves 
propagating in the +z direction at velocity c.  This is directly analogous to the propagating waves 

32  Note:  (3.2.11)  gives  the  total  inductance  L  for  a  length  D  of  line,  where  area  A  =  Dd.    The  inductance  per  unit 
length L = μd/W in both cases.

characterized  in  Figure  2.2.1  and  in  Equation  (2.2.9).    Demonstration  that  (7.1.15)  satisfies 
(7.1.14) for c = (με)-0.5 follows the same proof provided for (2.2.9) in (2.2.10–12). 

The  general  solution  to  (7.1.14)  is  any  arbitrary  waveform  of  the  form  (7.1.15)  plus  an 
independent arbitrary waveform propagating in the -z direction:

substituting  (7.1.16)  into  the  differential  equation  (7.1.11)  and  integrating  over  z.    Thus,  using 
the notation that v'(q) ≡ dv(q)/dq:

(7.1.17)

(7.1.18) 

Equation  (7.1.18)  defines  the  characteristic  impedance  Zo  =  (cC)-1  =  L / C   for  the  TEM  line. 
Both the forward and backward waves alone have the ratio Zo between v and i, although the sign 
of i is reversed for the negative-propagating wave because a positive voltage then corresponds to 
a negative current.  These same TEM results are derived differently in Sections 7.1.3 and 8.1.1. 

The characteristic impedance Zo of a parallel-plate line can be usefully related using (7.1.18) 
to  the  capacitance  C  and  inductance  L  per  meter,  where  C  =  εW/d  and  L  =  μd/W  for  parallel-

consistent with (7.1.6), where ηo = 1/cε = (μo/εo)0.5.

Sections 7.2–4.

Example 7.1A 
A certain TEM  line consists of  two parallel metal plates  that are 10 cm wide, separated  in air by 
d = 1 cm, and extremely long.  A voltage v(t) = 10 cos ωt volts is applied to the plates at one end 
(z  =  0).    What  currents  i(t,z)  flow?    What  power  P(t)  is  being  fed  to  the  line?    If  the  plate 
resistance  is  zero,  where  is  the  power  going?   What  is  the  inductance  L  per  unit  length  for  this 
line? 

Solution:	

In  a  TEM  line  the  ratio  v/i  =  Zo  for  a  single  wave,  where  Zo  =  ηod/W  [see  (7.1.6)], 
and ηo = (μ/ε)0.5  ≅ 377 ohms in air.  Therefore i(t,z) = Zo
-1v(t,z) = (W/dηo)10 cos(ωt -
kz)  ≅  [0.1/(0.01×377)]  10  cos(ωt  -  kz)  ≅ 0.27  cos[ω(t  -  z/c)]  [A].    P  =  vi  =  v2/Zo  ≅ 
2.65  cos2[ω(t  -  z/c)]  [W].    The  power  is  simply  propagating  losslessly  along  the  line 
toward  infinity.    Since  c  =  (LC)-0.5  =  3×108,  and  Zo  =  (L/C)0.5  ≅ 37.7,  therefore  L  = 
Zo/c = 1.3×10-7 [Henries m-1]. 

7.1.3  TEM waves in non-planar transmission lines 

TEM  waves  can  propagate  in  any  perfectly  conducting  structure  having  at  least  two  non-
contacting  conductors  with  an  arbitrary  cross-section  independent  of  z,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
7.1.2, if they are separated by a uniform medium characterized by ε, μ, and σ.  The parallel plate 
TEM  transmission  line  analyzed  in  Section  7.1.2  is  a  special  case  of  this  configuration,  and  we 
shall  see  that  the  behavior  of  non-planar  TEM  lines  is  characterized  by  the  same  differential 
equations  for  v(z,t)  and  i(z,t),  (7.1.10)  and  (7.1.11),  when  expressed  in  terms  of  L  and  C.    This 
result follows from the derivation below. 

We first divide the del operator into its transverse and longitudinal (z-axis) components:

The  right-hand sides of  these  two equations have no  zˆ  components, and  therefore  the  transverse

(7.1.38) 

Since the curl and divergence of  ET  and  HT  are zero, both these fields must independently 
satisfy  Laplace’s  equation  (4.5.7),  which  governs  electrostatics  and  magnetostatics;  these  field 
solutions  will  differ  because  their  boundary  conditions  differ.    Thus  we  can  find  the  transverse 
electric  and  magnetic  fields  for  TEM  lines  with  arbitrary  cross-sections  using  the  equation-
solving and field mapping methods described in Sections 4.5 and 4.6. 

The  behavior  of  E   and  H   for  an  arbitrary  TEM  line  can  be  expressed  more  simply  if  we 
first  define  the  line’s  capacitance  per meter C  and  the  inductance  per meter L.   C  is  the  charge  
Q'  per  unit  length  divided  by  the  voltage  v  between  the  two  conductors  of  interest,  and  L  is  the 
flux  linkage  Λ'  per  unit  length  divided  by  the  current  i.    Capacitance,  inductance,  and  flux 
linkage are discussed more fully in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

To compute Q' and Λ' we consider a differential element of length δ along the z axis of the TEM

relative  to  zˆ .  To  compute  the  voltage  v  we  integrate⎯ET  from  element  a  to  element  b,  and  to 
compute  the  current  i  we  integrate⎯HT  in  a  right-hand  sense  along  the  contour  C  circling

We  can  readily prove  that  the voltage  and  current  computed using  line  integrals  in  (7.1.39–

integration  for computing v within a plane corresponding  to a single value of z,  the paths ab and

∂i ( z, t  ) ∂z = − (G C+  ∂ ∂ t ) v ( z, t  )

This  pair  of  equations,  (7.1.49)  and  (7.1.51),  can  then  be  combined  to  yield  a  more  complete 
description of wave propagation on general TEM lines. 

Because  the  characteristic  impedance  and  phase  velocity  for  general  TEM  lines  are 
frequency dependent,  the  simple  solutions  (7.1.49) and  (7.1.51) are not convenient.    Instead  it  is 
useful to express them as complex functions of ω:

(7.1.59)

These expressions reduce to those for lossless TEM lines as G → 0. 

Another consequence of this dispersion relation (7.1.56) is that the TEM phase velocity vp is 
frequency dependent and thus most lossy lines are dispersive: 

vp  = ω k ' = ( LC

(7.1.60) 

Although most  TEM  lines  also  have  resistance R  per  unit  length,  this  introduces  Ez  ≠ 0,  so 
analysis  becomes  much  more  complex.    In  this  case  the  approximate  Telegrapher’s  equations 
(8.3.3–4) are often used. 

Example 7.1B 
What is the characteristic impedance Zo for the air-filled co-axial cable illustrated in Figure 7.1.3 
if the relevant diameters for the inner and outer conductors are a and b, respectively, where b/a = 
e?  “Co-axial” means cylinders a and b share the same axis of symmetry. 

Solution:  Zo  =  (L/C)0.5  from  (7.1.59).    Since  c  =  (LC)-0.5  it  follows  that  L  =  (c-2C-1)  and  Zo  = 
1/cC  ohms.    C  follows  from  (7.1.39),  which  requires  knowledge  of  the  transverse 
electric  field  ET   (for TEM waves,  there  are  no  non-transverse  fields).    Symmetry  in 
this cylindrical geometry requires  ET  = rˆEo  r .  Thus

7.1.4  Loss in transmission lines 

Transmission line losses can be computed in terms of the resistance R, Ohms per meter, of TEM 
line  length,  or  conductance  G,  Siemens/m,  of  the  medium  separating  the  two  conductors.  As 
discussed in Section 8.3.1, the time average power Pd dissipated per meter of length is simply the 
sum of the two contributions from the series and parallel conductances: 

2 
2 
P z W m  ] = I z
d ( ) [ 
( ) 
( ) 
 R 2  + V z

G  2  

(7.1.61)

When  R  and  G  are  unknown,  resistive  losses  in  transmission  lines  can  be  estimated  by 
2
integrating  J 2σ [W  m-3]  over  the  volume  of  interest,  where  σ  is  the material  conductivity  [S 
m-1]  and  J   is  the  current  density  [A  m-2].  This  surface  loss  density  Pd  [W  m-2]  is  derived  for 
good  conductors  in  Section  9.2  and  is  shown  in  (9.2.61)  to  be  equal  to  the  power  dissipated  by

TEM  coaxial  cable  carrying Po = 10 watts of  entertainment over  a 500-MHz band with  an  inner

)0.5  2πr   [A/m] ≅  142.  Also,  since  the  diameter

of  the  outer  sheath  is  typically  ~5  times  that  of  the  inner  conductor,  the  surface  current  density 
there,  Js,  is  one  fifth  that  for  the  inner  conductor,  and  the  power  dissipation  per  meter  length  is 
also  one  fifth.  Therefore  the  total  power  dissipated  per  meter,  PL,  in  both  conductors  is  ~1.2 
times that dissipated in the inner conductor alone.  If we consider only the highest and most lossy 
frequency,  and  assume  σ  =  5×107,  then  substituting 
H s 
into  (7.1.62)  and  integrating  over  both 
conductors yields the power loss:

Thus  PL  is  0.48  watts/meter,  a  large  fraction  of  the  ten  watts  propagating  on  the  line.  This 
loss  of  4.8  percent  of  the  power  per  meter,  including  the  outer  conductor,  corresponds  to  10 
log10(1  -  0.048)  ≅  -0.21dB  per  meter.    If  we  would  like  amplifiers  along  a  cable  to  provide  no 
more  than  ~50  dB  gain, we  need  amplifiers  every  ~234 meters.   Dropping  the  top  frequency  to 
100 MHz,  or  increasing  the  diameter  of  the  central wire  could  reduce  these  losses  by  perhaps  a 
factor  of  ~4.    These  loss  issues  and  desires  for  broad  bandwidth  are  motivating  substitution  of 
low-loss optical fiber over long cable lines, and use of co-axial cables only for short hops from a 
local fiber to the home or business. 

Example 7.1C 
A  perfectly  conducting  50-ohm  coaxial  cable  is  filled  with  slightly  conducting  dielectric  that 
gives  the  line  a  shunt  conductivity  G  =  10-6  Siemens  m-1  between  the  two  conductors. What  is 
the attenuation of this cable (dB m-1)? 

- 197 -




Solution:  	 The  attenuation L[dB m-1] =  4.34 Pd/Po  (7.1.64), where  the  power  on  the  line Po  [W] 
=  |V|2/2Zo, and  the dissipation here  is Pd  [W m-1] =  |V|2G/2  (7.1.61);  see Figure 8.3.1 
for the incremental model of a lossy TEM transmission line.  Therefore L = 4.34 GZo 
=  2.2×10-4  dB  m-1.  This  is  generally  independent  of  frequency  and  therefore  might 
dominate  at  lower  frequencies  if  the  frequency-dependent  dissipative  losses  in  the 
wires become sufficiently small.

TEM lines with junctions 

7.2.1  Boundary value problems 

A  junction  between  two  transmission  lines  forces  the  fields  in  the  first  line  to  conform  to  the 
fields  at  the  second  line  at  the  boundary  between  the  two.    This  is  a  simple  example  of  a  broad 
class of problems called boundary value problems.  The general electromagnetic boundary value 
problem  involves  determining  exactly  which,  if  any,  combination  of  waves  matches  any  given 
set  of  boundary  conditions,  which  generally  includes  both  active  and  passive  boundaries,  the 
active  boundaries  usually  being  sources.    Boundary  conditions  generally  constrain  E   and/or  H 
for all time on the boundary of the one-, two- or three-dimensional region of interest. 

The  uniqueness  theorem  presented  in  Section  2.8  states  that  only  one  solution  satisfies  all 
Maxwell’s equations if the boundary conditions are sufficient. Therefore we may solve boundary 
value  problems  simply  by  hypothesizing  the  correct  combination  of waves  and  testing  it  against 
Maxwell’s  equations.  That  is, we  leave  undetermined  the  numerical  constants  that  characterize 
the  chosen  combination  of  waves,  and  then  determine  which  values  of  those  constraints  satisfy 
Maxwell’s  equations.  This  strategy  eases  the  challenge  of  hypothesizing  the  final  answer 
directly.  Moreover,  symmetry  and  other  considerations  often  suggest  the  nature  of  the  wave 
combination required by the problem, thus reducing the numbers of unknown constants that must 
be determined. 

The four basic steps for solving boundary value problems are: 

1)  Determine the natural behavior of each homogeneous section of the system without the 
boundaries. 

2)  Express  this  general  behavior  as  the  superposition  of  waves  or  static  fields 
characterized by unknown constants; symmetry and other considerations can minimize 
the number of waves required.  Here our basic building blocks are TEM waves. 

3)  Write  equations  for  the  boundary  conditions  that  must  be  satisfied  by  these  sets  of 
superimposed waves, and then solve for the unknown constants. 

4)  Test  the  resulting  solution  against  any  of  Maxwell’s  equations  that  have  not  already 
been imposed.

Variations  of  this  four-step  procedure  can  be  used  to  solve  almost  any  problem  by  replacing 
Maxwell’s  equations  with  their  approximate  equivalent  for  the  given  problem  domain34.  For 
example,  profitability,  available  capital,  technological  constraints,  employee  capabilities,  and 
customer needs are often “boundary conditions” when deriving strategies for start-up enterprises, 
while  “natural  behavior”  could  include  the  probable  family  of  behaviors  of  the  entrepreneurial 
team and its customers, financiers, and suppliers. 

7.2.2  Waves at TEM junctions in the time domain 

The boundary value problem approach described  in Section 7.2.1 can be used for waves at TEM 
junctions.  We assume that an arbitrary incident wave will produce both reflected and transmitted 
waves.  For  this  introductory problem we  also  assume  that no waves are  incident  from  the other 
direction,  for  their  solution could be  superimposed  later.    Section 7.2.3  treats  the  same problem 
 
in  the  complex  domain.    We  represent  TEM  lines  graphically  by  parallel  lines  and  their 
characteristic impedance Zo, as illustrated in Figure 7.2.1 for lines a and b.

Step  one  of  the  boundary  value  method  involves  characterizing  the  natural  behavior  of 
waves  in  the  two  media  of  interest,  lines  a  and  b.    This  follows  from  (7.1.16)  for  v(z,t)  and 
(7.1.18)  for  i(z,t).    Step  two  involves  hypothesizing  the  form  of  the  reflected  and  transmitted 
waves,  v-(z,t)  and  vt(z,t).    For  simplicity  we  assume  the  source  v+(z,t)  is  on  the  left,  the  TEM 
junction is at z = 0, and the line impedances Zo are constants independent of time and frequency. 
Step  three  is  to  write  the  boundary  conditions  for  the  waves  with  unknown  constants;  v  and  i 
must both be constant across the junction at z = 0:

) + v− ( z, t  ) = v t  ( z, t  )

Step four  involves solving (7.2.1) and (7.2.2) for  the unknown waves v-(z,t) and vt(z,t).   We 
can  simplify  the  problem  by  taking  the  ratios  of  reflection  and  transmission  relative  to  the 
incident wave and provide its amplitude later.  If we regard the arguments (z=0, t) as understood, 
then (7.2.1) and (7.2.2) become: 

34  A  key  benefit  of  a  technical  education  involves  learning  precise  ways  of  thinking  and  solving  problems;  this 
procedure, when generalized, is an excellent example applicable to almost any career.

(7.2.4)

To make  the algebra for  these  two equations still more transparent it is customary to define v-/v+ 
as  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ,  vt/v+  as  the  transmission  coefficient  T,  and  Z Zo  = Zn  as  the
t 
normalized impedance for line b.  Note that v-, v+, Zo, and Zt are real, and the fraction of incident 
power that is reflected from a junction is  Γ 2 .  Equations (7.2.3) and (7.2.4) then become:

(7.2.10) 

The transitions to (7.2.9) and (7.2.10) utilized the fact that if two functions of two arguments 
are  equal  for  all  values  of  their  arguments,  then  the  functions  remain  equal  as  their  arguments 
undergo  the  same  numerical  shifts.    For  example,  if  X(a)  =  Y(b)  where  a  and  b  have  the  same 
units,  then X(a +  c) = Y(b +  c).  Combining  (7.2.3)  and  (7.2.7)  yields  the  transmitted  voltage  vt 
in terms of the source voltage v+: 

v t ( z − ct ) = ⎡⎣2Z n  ( Zn  + 1)⎤⎦ v+ ( z − ct ) 

(7.2.11) 

This completes the solution for signal behavior at single TEM junctions. 

Example 7.2A 
Two parallel plates of width W and separation d1 = 1 cm are connected at z = D to a similar pair 
of  plates  spaced  only  d2  =  2 mm  apart.    If  the  forward wave  on  the  first  line  is Vo  cos(ωt  -  kz), 
what voltage vt(t,z) is transmitted beyond the junction at z = D? 

- 200 -


Solution:  vt(t,z)  =  Tv+(t,z)  =  (1  +  Γ)v+(t,z)  =  2Zn  v+(t,z)/(Zn  +  1),  where  Zn  =  Zt/Zo  = 
ηod2W/ηod1W  =  d2/d1  =  0.2.  Therefore  for  z  >  D,  vt(t,z)  =  v+(t,z)2×0.2/(0.2  +  1)  = 
(Vo/3)cos(ωt - kz) [V]. 

7.2.3 

Sinusoidal waves on TEM transmission lines and at junctions 

The  basic  equations  characterizing  lossless  TEM  lines  in  the  sinusoidal  steady  state  correspond 
to the pair of differential equations (7.1.25) and (7.1.26):

(7.2.12) 

(7.2.13) 

L and C are the inductance and capacitance of the line per meter, respectively. 

This pair of equations leads easily to the transmission line wave equation: 

2  ( ) dz  2  = −ω2LCV  z( )  
d V z 

(wave equation) 

(7.2.14)

The solution V(z) to this wave equation involves exponentials in z because the second derivative 
of V(z) equals a constant  times V(z).  The exponents can be + or  -,  so  in general a  sum of  these 
two  alternatives  is  possible,  where  V+  and  V-  are  complex  constants  determined  later  by 
boundary conditions and k is given by (7.1.30): 

V z ( ) = V + e− jkz  + V −e+ jkz  [

(7.2.18) 

The  characteristic  admittance  Yo  of  the  line  is  the  reciprocal  of Zo,  and  has  units  of Siemens  or 
ohms-1.  It  is  important  to  appreciate  the  physical  significance  of  Zo;  it  is  simply  the  ratio  of 
voltage  to  current  for  a wave  propagating  in  one  direction  only  on  the  line,  e.g.,  for  the  + wave 
only.  This  ratio does not correspond  to dissipative  losses  in  the  line, although  it  is  related  to  the 
power traveling down the line for any given voltage across the line.

When  there  are  both  forward  and  backward  waves  on  a  line,  the  voltage/current  ratio  is 
called  the  complex  impedance  and  varies  with  position,  as  suggested  in  Figure  7.2.2(a).    The 
impedance at any point along the line is defined as:

When z = 0 at the load, then V-/V+ is defined at the load and ΓL is the load reflection coefficient, 
denoted by the subscript L. 

Equation  (7.2.20)  leads  to  a  simple  algorithm  for  relating  impedances  at  different  points 
along the line.  We first define normalized impedance Zn and relate it to the reflection coefficient 
Γ(z) using (7.2.19); (7.2.22) follows from (7.2.21):

For example, we can see the effect of the load impedance ZL (z = 0) at some other point z on the 
line by using (7.2.20–22) in an appropriate sequence: 

Z  → Z  → Γ  → Γ(z) → Z  (z) → ( )
  Z  z     (impedance transformation)  (7.2.23)

A simple example of the use of (7.2.23) is the transformation of a 50-ohm resistor by a 100-ohm 
line  λ/4  long.   Using  (7.2.23)  in  sequence, we  see  ZL  =  50,  ZLn  =  50/100  =  0.5,  ΓL  =  -1/3  from 
(7.2.22), Γ(z = -λ/4) = +1/3 from (7.2.20) where e+2jkz = e2j(2π/λ)(-λ/4) = e-jπ = -1, Zn(-λ/4) = 2 from 
(7.2.21), and therefore Z(-λ/4) = 200 ohms.

Two  other  impedance  transformation  techniques  are  often  used  instead:  a  direct  equation 
and  the  Smith  chart  (Section  7.3).    The  direct  equation  (7.2.24)  can  be  derived  by  first 
substituting ΓL =  (ZL  - Zo)/(ZL + Zo  ),  i.e.  (7.2.22),  into Z(z) = V(z)/I(z), where V(z) and I(z) are 
given  by  (7.2.15)  and  (7.2.17),  respectively,  and  V-/V+  =  ΓL  .  The  next  step  involves  grouping 
the  exponentials  to  yield  sin  kz  and  cos  kz,  and  then  dividing  sin  by  cos  to  yield  tan  and  the 
solution:

A  closely  related  problem  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.2.2(b)  where  two  transmission  lines  are 
connected  together  and  the  right-hand  line  presents  the  impedance  Zt  at  z  =  0.    To  illustrate  the 
general method  for solving boundary value problems outlined  in Section 7.2.1, we shall use  it  to 
compute  the  reflection  and  transmission  coefficients  at  this  junction.    The  expressions  (7.2.15) 
and (7.2.17) nearly satisfy the first two steps of that method, which involve writing trial solutions 
composed  of  superimposed  waves  with  unknown  coefficients  that  satisfy  the  wave  equation 
within each region of interest.  The third step is to write equations for these waves that satisfy the 
boundary  conditions,  and  then  to  solve  for  the  unknown  coefficients.    Here  the  boundary 
conditions  are  that  both  V  and  I  are  continuous  across  the  junction  at  z  =  0;  the  subscript  t 
corresponds  to  the  transmitted  wave.    The  two  waves  on  the  left-hand  side  have  amplitudes  V+ 
and V-, whereas  the wave on  the  right-hand side has amplitude Vt.  We assume no energy enters 
from the right.  Therefore:

Γ and T, respectively, where:

where  normalized  impedance was  defined  in  (7.2.21)  as  Zn  ≡ Zt/Zo.  For  example,  (7.2.31)  says 
that  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ  is  zero  when  the  normalized  impedance  is  unity  and  the  line 
impedance is matched, so Zt = Zo; (7.2.32) then yields T = 1. 

The  complex  coefficients  Γ and  T  refer  to wave  amplitudes,  but  often  it  is  power  that  is  of 
interest.  In general the time-average power incident upon the junction is:

Another consequence of having both forward and backward moving waves on a TEM line is 
that  the magnitudes of  the voltage and current vary along  the  length of  the  line.   The expression 
for voltage given in (7.2.15) can be rearranged as: 

( ) = 
V z 

V + e− jkz  + V −e+ jkz  V + e− jkz

( ) 
1 + Γ z 

(7.2.34)

The magnitude  of  |V+e-jkz|  is  independent  of  z,  so  the  factor  |1 + Γ(z)|  controls  the magnitude  of 
voltage  on  the  line,  where  Γ(z)  =  ΓLe2jkz  (7.2.20).  Figure  7.2.3(a)  illustrates  the  behavior  of 
|V(z)|;  it  is quasi-sinusoidal with period λ/2 because of  the 2jkz  in  the exponent.   The maximum 
value |V(z)|max = |V+| + |V-| occurs when Γ(z) = |Γ|; the minimum occurs when Γ(z) = - |Γ|.

The  origins  of  this  behavior  of  |V(z)|  is  suggested  in Figure  7.2.3(b), which  illustrates  the  z 
dependence of Γ(z)  in  the  complex gamma plane, where  the horizontal  and vertical  axes  are  the 
real  and  imaginary  parts  of  Γ(z),  respectively.    Increases  in  z  simply  rotate  the  vector  Γ(z) 
clockwise, preserving its magnitude [see (7.2.20) and Figure 7.2.3(b)]. 

The quasi-sinusoidal  form of  |V(z)| arises because  |V(z)| ∝ |1 + Γ(z)|, which  is  the  length of 
the vector linking Γ(z) with the point -1 on the gamma plane, as illustrated in Figure 7.2.3(b).  As 
the phase φ of Γ varies with z and circles the diagram, the vector 1 + Γ(z) varies as might an arm 
turning  a  crank,  and  so  it  is  sometimes  called  the  “crank  diagram”.   When  |Γ|  <<  1  then  |V(z)| 
resembles  a  weak  sinusoid  oscillating  about  a  mean  value  of  |V+|,  whereas  when  |Γ|  ≅ 1  then 
|V(z)|  resembles  a  fully  rectified  sinusoid.    The  voltage  envelope  |V(z)|  is  called  the  standing-
wave  pattern,  and  fields  have  a  standing-wave  component  when  |Γ|  >  0.  The  figure  also 
illustrates  how  |I(z)|  ∝ |1  - Γ(z)|  exhibits  the  same  quasi-sinusoidal  variation  as  |V(z)|,  but  180 
degrees out of phase. 

Because  |V(z)|  and  |I(z)|  are  generally  easy  to  measure  along  any  transmission  line,  it  is 
useful  to  note  that  such  measurements  can  be  used  to  determine  not  only  the  fraction  of  power 
that  has  been  reflected  from  any  load,  and  thus  the  efficiency  of  any  connection,  but  also  the 
impedance of the load itself.  First we define the voltage standing wave ratio or VSWR as: 

( ) max 
VSWR  ≡ V z 

( ) min 
V z 

=  V + + V −  V+ − V − ) = (1 + Γ 
( 
) (
) (1 −

Γ ) 

(7.2.35)

Therefore: 

Γ = (VSWR − 1) ( VSWR + 1) 

2  = [(VSWR  − 1) ( VSWR  + 1)]2 
P P  
+ = Γ 
−

(7.2.36) 

(7.2.37)

This  simple  relation  between VSWR  and  fractional  power  reflected  (P-/P+)  helped make VSWR 
a common specification for electronic equipment. 

To  find  the  load  impedance  ZL  from  observations  of  |V(z)|  such  as  those  plotted  in  Figure 
7.2.3(a)  we  first  associate  any  voltage  minimum  with  that  point  on  the  gamma  plane  that 
corresponds to -|Γ|.  Then we can rotate on the gamma plane counter-clockwise (toward the load) 
an  angle  φ =  2kD  =  4πD/λ  radians  that  corresponds  to  the  distance  D  between  that  voltage 
minimum  and  the  load,  where  a  full  revolution  in  the  gamma  plane  corresponds  to  D  =  λ/2. 
Once Γ for the load is determined, it follows from (7.2.21) that: 

ZL  = Zo [1 + Γ ] [1 − Γ ] 

(7.2.38) 

If more than two TEM lines join a single junction then their separate impedances combine in 
series  or  parallel,  as  suggested  in  Figure  7.2.4.    The  impedances  add  in  parallel  for  Figure 
7.2.4(a) so the impedance at the junction as seen from the left would be:

Figure  7.2.4(c)  illustrates  how  TEM  lines  can  be  concatenated.    In  this  case  the  impedance 
Z1  seen  at  the  left-hand  terminals  could  be  determined  by  transforming  the  impedance  ZL  at 
terminals (3) to the impedance Z2 that would be seen at terminals (2).  The impedance seen at (2) 
could  then  be  transformed  a  second  time  to  yield  the  impedance  seen  at  the  left-hand  end.    The 
algorithm for this might be: 

ZL → ZLn

 → Γ3 → Γ2 → Zn 2

 → Z2 → Zn 2'

 → Γ2' → Γ1 → Zn1

 → Z1 

(7.2.40) 

Note  that Zn2  is normalized with  respect  to Za and Zn2'  is normalized with respect  to Zo; both are 
defined  at  junction  (2).  Also,  Γ2  is  the  reflection  coefficient  at  junction  (2)  within  the  line  Za, 
and Γ2' is the reflection coefficient at junction (2) within the line Zo. 

Example 7.2B 
A 100-ohm air-filled TEM  line  is  terminated at z = 0 with a capacitor C = 10-11  farads.   What  is  
Γ(z)?  At what positions z < 0 are voltage minima located on the line when f = 1/2π GHz?  What 
is the VSWR?  At z = - λ/4, what is the equivalent impedance? 

Solution:  The normalized load impedance ZL/Zo  ≡ ZLn = 1/jωCZo = -j/(109×10-11×100) = -j, and 
(7.2.22)  gives  ΓL  =  (ZLn  -  1)/(ZLn  +  1)  =  -(1+j)/(1-j)  =  -j.  Γ(z)  =  ΓLe2jkz  =  -je2jkz. 
(7.2.34) gives  |V(z)| ∝  |1 + Γ(z)| =  |1 -  je2jkz| = 0 when e2jkz = -j = e-j(π/2  + n2π), where n 
=0,1,2…  Therefore 2jkz =  -j(π/2 + n2π),  so z(nulls) =  -(π/2 + n2π)λ/4π =  -(λ/8)(1 + 
4n).  But f = 109/2π, and so λ = c/f = 2πc×10-9 = 0.6π [m].  (7.2.34) gives VSWR = (1 
+  |Γ|)/(1 -  |Γ|) = ∞.  At z =  -λ/4, Γ →  -ΓL = +j via  (7.2.20), so by  (7.2.38) Z = Zo[1 + 
Γ]/[1 - Γ] = 100[1 + j]/[1 - j] = j100 = jωLo ⇒ Lo = 100/ω = 100/109 = 10-7 [H].

The VSWR observed on a 100-ohm air-filled TEM transmission line is 2.  The voltage minimum 
is 15 cm  from  the  load and  the distance between minima  is 30 cm.   What  is  the  frequency of  the 
radiation?  What is the impedance ZL of the load? 

Solution:	 The  distance  between  minima  is  λ/2,  so  λ  =  60  cm  and  f  =  c/λ  =  3×108/0.6  =  500 
MHz.  The load impedance is ZL = Zo[1 + ΓL]/[1 - ΓL] (7.2.38) where |ΓL| = (VSWR - 
1)/(VSWR  +  1)  =  1/3  from  (5.2.83).    ΓL  is  rotated  on  the  Smith  chart  180  degrees 
counter-clockwise  (toward  the  load)  from  the  voltage  minimum,  corresponding  to  a 
quarter wavelength.  The  voltage minimum must  lie  on  the  negative  real Γ  axis,  and 
therefore ΓL  lies  on  the  positive  real  Γ  axis.    Therefore  ΓL  =  1/3  and  ZL  =  100(1  + 
1/3)/(1 - 1/3) = 200 ohms. 

7.3  Methods for matching transmission lines 

7.3.1 

Frequency-dependent behavior 

This  section  focuses  on  the  frequency-dependent  behavior  introduced  by  obstacles  and 
impedance  transitions  in  transmission  lines,  including  TEM  lines,  waveguides,  and  optical 
systems.    Frequency-dependent  transmission  line  behavior  can  also  be  introduced  by  loss,  as 
discussed  in  Section  8.3.1,  and  by  the  frequency-dependent  propagation  velocity  of waveguides 
and optical fibers, as discussed in Sections 9.3 and 12.2. 

The  basic  issue  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.3.1(a), where  an  obstacle  reflects  some  fraction  of 
the  incident  power.    If  we  wish  to  eliminate  losses  due  to  reflections  we  need  to  cancel  the 
reflected wave by adding another that has the same magnitude but is 180° out of phase.  This can 
easily  be  done  by  adding  another  obstacle  in  front  of  or  behind  the  first  with  the  necessary 
properties,  as  suggested  in  (b).  However,  the  reflections  from  the  further  obstacle  can  bounce 
between the two obstacles multiple times, and the final result must consider these additional rays 
too.  If  the  reflections are  small  the multiple  reflections become negligible.   This  strategy works 
for any type of transmission line, including TEM lines, waveguides and optical systems.

The most  important  consequence of  any  such  tuning  strategy  to  eliminate  reflections  is  that 
the  two  reflective  sources  are  often  offset  spatially,  so  the  relative  phase  between  them  is 
wavelength  dependent.    If  multiple  reflections  are  important,  this  frequency  dependence  can 
increase  substantially.   Rather  than  consider  all  these  reflections  in  a  tedious way, we  can more 
directly  solve  the  equations  by  extending  the  analysis  of  Section  7.2.3,  which  is  summarized 
below  in  the  context  of  TEM  lines  having  characteristic  admittance  Yo  and  a  termination  of 
complex impedance ZL:

Zn can be  related  to Γ(z) by dividing  (7.3.1) by  (7.3.2)  to  find Z(z), and  the  inverse  relation 
(7.3.3) follows.  Using (7.3.3) and (7.3.4) in the following sequences, the impedance Z(z2) at any 
point on an unobstructed line can be related to the impedance at any other point z1:

The  five  arrows  in  (7.3.5)  correspond  to  application  of  equations  (7.3.3)  and  (7.3.4)  in  the 
following left-to-right sequence: (4), (3), (3), (4), (4), respectively. 

One standard problem involves determining Z(z) (for z < 0) resulting from a load impedance 
ZL at z = 0.  One approach  is  to  replace  the operations  in (7.3.5) by a single equation, derived  in 
(7.2.24): 

Z z( ) = Z  (ZL  − jZ  tan kz ) (Z  − jZ  tan kz )

 (impedance transformation) 

(7.3.6)

For example, if ZL = 0, then Z(z) = -jZo tan kz, which means that Z(z) can range between -j∞ and 
+j∞,  depending  on  z, mimicking  any  reactance  at  a  single  frequency.   The  impedance  repeats  at 
distances of Δz = λ, where k(Δz) = (2π/λ)Δz = 2π.  If ZL = Zo, then Z(z) = Zo everywhere. 

Example 7.3A 
What is the impedance at 100 MHz of a 100-ohm TEM line λ/4 long and connected to a: 1) short 
circuit?  2) open circuit?  3) 50-ohm resistor? 4) capacitor C = 10-10 F?

Solution:	

In all  four cases  the  relation between Γ(z = 0) = ΓL at  the  load, and Γ(z =  -λ/4)  is  the 
same  [see  (7.3.3)]: Γ(z =  -λ/4) = ΓLe2jkz = ΓLe2j(2π/λ)(-λ/4) =  - ΓL.  Therefore  in  all  four 
cases we see from (7.3.4) that Zn(z = -λ/4) = (1 - ΓL)/(1 + ΓL) = 1/Zn(0).  Zn(z = 0) for 
these four cases  is: 0, ∞, 0.5, and 1/jωCZo = 1/(j2π10810-10100) = 1/j2π, respectively. 
-1  ohms,  which  for  these  four  cases  equals: ∞,  0,  200, 
Therefore  Z(z  =  -λ/4)  =  100Zn
and  j200π  ohms,  respectively.    Since  the  impedance  of  an  inductor  is  Z  =  jωL,  it 
follows 
that

7.3.2 

Smith chart, stub tuning, and quarter-wave transformers 

A common problem is how to cancel reflections losslessly, thus forcing all incident power into a 
load.  This  requires addition of one or more  reactive  impedances  in  series or  in parallel with  the 
line so as  to convert  the  impedance at  that point  to Zo, where  it must  remain  for all points closer 
to the source or next obstacle.  Software tools to facilitate this have been developed, but a simple 
graphical tool, the Smith chart, provides useful insight into what can easily be matched and what 
cannot.  Prior to computers it was widely used to design and characterize microwave systems.   

The  key  operations  in  (7.3.5)  are  rotation  on  the  gamma  plane  [Γ(z1)  ⇔  Γ(z2)]  and  the 
conversions  Zn  ⇔  Γ,  given  by  (7.3.3–4).  Both  of  these  operations  can  be  accommodated  on  a 
single  graph  that  maps  the  one-to-one  relationship  Zn  ⇔  Γ  on  the  complex  gamma  plane,  as 
suggested  in  Figure  7.3.2(a).    Conversions  Γ(z1)  ⇔  Γ(z2)  are  simply  rotations  on  the  gamma 
plane.  The  gamma  plane  was  introduced  in  Figure  7.2.3.    The  Smith  chart  simply  overlays  the 
equivalent  normalized  impedance  values  Zn  on  the  gamma  plane;  only  a  few  key  values  are 
indicated  in  the simplified version shown  in (a).   For example,  the  loci for which  the real Rn and 
imaginary parts  Xn of Zn remain constant lie on segments of circles (Zn  ≡ Rn + jXn) .

Rotation  on  the  gamma  plane  relates  the  values  of  Zn  and  Γ at  one  z  to  their  values  at 
another,  as  suggested  in Figure 7.3.2(b).  Since Γ(z) =  (V-/V+)e2jkz = ΓLe2jkz = ΓLe-2jk(cid:65),  and  since 
ejφ corresponds  to  counter-clockwise  rotation  as φ  increases, movement  toward  the generator  (-z 
direction)  corresponds  to  clockwise  rotation  in  the  gamma  plane.    The  exponent  of  e-2jk(cid:65)  is  ­
j4π(cid:65)/λ,  so  a  full  rotation  on  the  gamma  plane  corresponds  to movement  (cid:65)  down  the  line  of  only 
λ/2. 

A simple example  illustrates  the use of  the Smith chart.   Consider an  inductor having  jωL = 
j100 on a 100-ohm  line.   Then Zn =  j, which corresponds  to a point at  the  top of  the Smith chart 
where Γ = +j (normally Zn  ≠ Γ).  If we move toward the generator λ/4, corresponding to rotation 
of Γ(z) half way  round  the Smith chart,  then we arrive at  the bottom where Zn = -j and Z = ZoZn 
= -j100 = 1/jωC.  So the equivalent capacitance C at the new location is 1/100ω farads. 

The  Smith  chart  has  several  other  interesting  properties.    For  example,  rotation  half  way 
round  the  chart  (changing  Γ to  - Γ)  converts  any  normalized  impedance  into  the  corresponding 
normalized  admittance.    This  is  easily  proved:  since  Γ =  (Zn  -  1)/(Zn  +  1),  conversion  of  Zn  → 
-1 + 1) =  (1  - Zn)/(Zn + 1) =  - Γ [Q.E.D.]35  Pairs of points with  this 
-1 yields Γ' =  (Zn
-1  - 1)/(Zn
Zn
property include Zn = ±j and Zn = (0,∞). 

Another  useful  property  of  the  Smith  chart  is  that  the  voltage-standing-wave  ratio  (VSWR) 
equals the maximum positive real value Rn max of Zn lying on the circular locus occupied by Γ(z). 
This is easily shown from the definition of VSWR:

A more  important  use  of  the  Smith  chart  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.3.3, where  the  load  60  + 
j80 is to be matched to a 100-ohm TEM line so all the power is dissipated in the 60-ohm resistor. 
In  particular  the  length  (cid:65)  of  the  transmission  line  in  Figure  7.3.3(a)  is  to  be  chosen  so  as  to 
transform  ZL  =  60  +  80j  so  that  its  real  part  becomes  Zo.  The  new  imaginary  part  can  be 
cancelled by a reactive load (L or C) that will be placed either in position M or N.  The first step 
is  to  locate Zn  on  the  Smith  chart  at  the  intersection  of  the Rn  =  0.6  and Xn  =  0.8  circles, which 
happen  to  fall  at  Γ  =  0.5j.   Next we  locate  the  gamma  circle Γ(z)  along which we  can move  by 
varying  (cid:65).  This  intersects  the  Rn  =  1  circle  at  point  “a”  after  rotating  toward  the  generator 
“distance A”.  Next we can add a negative reactance to cancel the reactance jXn = +1.18j at point 
“a” to yield Zn(a) = 1 and Z = Zo.  A negative reactance is a capacitor C in series at location M in 
the  circuit.    Therefore  1/jωC  =  -1.18jZo  and  C  =  (1.18ωZo)-1.  The  required  line  length  (cid:65) 
corresponds  to  ~0.05λ,  a  scale  for  which  is  printed  on  the  perimeter  of  official  charts  as 
illustrated in Figure 7.3.4.

More than three other matching schemes can be used here.  For example, we could lengthen 
(cid:65) to distance “B” and point “b”, where a positive reactance of Xn = 1.18 could be added in series 
at position M to provide a match.  This requires an inductor L = 1.18Zo/ω. 

Alternatively, we could note  that ZLn corresponds  to YLn = 0.6  - 0.8j on  the opposite side of 
the chart (Γ → -Γ), where the fact that both ZLn and YLn have the same real parts is a coincidence 
limited to cases where ΓL is pure imaginary.  Rotating toward the generator distance C again puts 
us on the Gn = 1 circle (Yn  ≡ Gn + jBn), so we can add a negative admittance Bn of -1.18j to yield 
Yo.  Adding  a  negative  admittance  in  parallel  at  z  =  -  (cid:65)  corresponds  to  adding  an  inductor  L  in 
position  N,  where  -jZoXn  =  1/jωL,  so  L  =  (1.18ωZo)-1.  By  rotating  further  to  point  “b”  a 
capacitor could be added  in parallel  instead of  the  inductor.   Generally one uses  the shortest  line 
length possible and the smallest, lowest-cost, lowest-loss reactive element.

Often printed circuits do not add capacitors or  inductors  to  tune devices, but simply print an 
extra  TEM  line  on  the  circuit  board  that  is  open-  or  short-circuit  at  its  far  end  and  is  cut  to  a 
length that yields the desired equivalent L or C at the given frequency ω.

One useful  approach  to matching  resistive  loads  is  to  insert a quarter-wavelength  section of 
TEM  line  of  impedance  ZA  between  the  load  ZL  and  the  feed  line  impedance  Zo.  Then  ZLn  = 
ZL/ZA  and  one  quarter-wave-length  down  the  TEM  line  where  Γ  becomes  -  Γ,  the  normalized 
2/ZL.  If 
impedance becomes  the  reciprocal, Z'n = ZA/ZL and  the  total  impedance  there  is Z' = ZA
 
2/ZL  then  there  are  no 
this  matches  the  output  transmission  line  impedance  Zo  so  that  Zo  =  ZA
reflections.  The  quarter-wavelength  section  is  called  a  quarter-wave  transformer  and  has  the 
impedance ZA =  (ZLZo)0.5.  A  similar  technique can be used  if  the  load  is partly  reactive without 
the  need  for L’s  or C’s,  but  the  length  and  impedance  of  the  transformer must  be  adjusted.    For 
example, any line impedance ZA will yield a normalized load impedance that can be rotated on a 
Smith  chart  to  become  a  real  impedance;  if  ZA  and  the  transformer  length  are  chosen  correctly, 
this  real  impedance  will  match  Zo.  Matching  usually  requires  iteration  with  a  Smith  chart  or  a 
numerical technique.

TEM resonances 

7.4.1 

Introduction 

Resonators  are  widely  used  for manipulating  signals  and  power,  although  unwanted  resonances 
can  sometimes  limit  system  performance.    For  example,  resonators  can  be  used  either  as  band-
pass  filters  that  remove  all  frequencies  from  a  signal  except  those  near  the  desired  resonant 
frequency  ωn,  or  as  band-stop  filters  that  remove  unwanted  frequencies  near  ωn  and  let  all 
frequencies pass.  They can also be used effectively as  step-up  transformers  to  increase voltages 
or  currents  to  levels  sufficient  to  couple  all  available  energy  into  desired  loads  without 
reflections.    That  is,  the  matching  circuits  discussed  in  Section  7.3.2  can  become  sufficiently 
reactive  for  badly mismatched  loads  that  they  act  like  band-pass  resonators  that  match  the  load 
only  for  a  narrow  band  of  frequencies.  Although  simple  RLC  resonators  have  but  one  natural 
resonance  and  complex  RLC  circuits  have  many,  distributed  electromagnetic  systems  can  have 
an infinite number. 

A  resonator  is  any  structure  that  can  trap  oscillatory  electromagnetic  energy  so  that  it 
escapes  slowly or not  at  all.  Section 7.4.2 discusses  energy  trapped  in TEM  lines  terminated  so 
that  outbound  waves  are  reflected  back  into  the  resonator,  and  Section  9.4  treats  cavity 
resonators formed by terminating rectangular waveguides with short circuits that similarly reflect 
and  trap  otherwise  escaping  waves.    In  each  of  these  cases  boundary  conditions  restricted  the 
allowed  wave  structure  inside  to  patterns  having  integral  numbers  of  half-  or  quarter-
wavelengths  along  any  axis  of  propagation,  and  thus  only  certain  discrete  resonant  frequencies 
ωn can be present. 

All  resonators  dissipate  energy  due  to  resistive  losses,  leakages,  and  radiation,  as  discussed 
in Section 7.4.3.  The rate at which this occurs depends on where the peak currents or voltages in 
the  resonator  are  located with  respect  to  the  resistive  or  radiating  elements.    For  example,  if  the 
resistive  element  is  in  series  at  a  current  null  or  in  parallel  at  a  voltage  null,  there  is  no 
dissipation.  Since  dissipation  is  proportional  to  resonator  energy  content  and  to  the  squares  of 
current or voltage,  the decay of field strength and stored energy  is generally exponential  in  time. 
Each  resonant  frequency  fn has  its own  rate of energy decay, characterized by  the dimensionless 

- 213 -


quality  factor Qn, which  is generally  the number of  radians ωnt  required  for  the  total energy wTn 
stored  in  mode  n  to  decay  by  a  factor  of  1/e.    More  importantly,  Q  ≅ fo/Δf,  where  fn  is  the 
resonant frequency and Δfn is the half-power full-width of resonance n. 

Section  7.4.4  then  discusses  how  resonators  can  be  coupled  to  circuits  for  use  as  filters  or 
transformers,  and  Section  7.4.5  discusses  how  arbitrary  waveforms  in  resonators  are  simply  a 
superposition of orthogonal modes, each decaying at its own rate. 

7.4.2  TEM resonator frequencies 

A resonator is any structure that traps electromagnetic radiation so it escapes slowly or not at all. 
Typical  TEM  resonators  are  terminated  at  their  ends  with  lossless  elements  such  as  short-  or 
open-circuits, inductors, or capacitors.  Complex notation is used because resonators are strongly 
frequency-dependent.  We  begin  with  the  expressions  (7.1.55)  and  (7.1.58)  for  voltage  and 
current on TEM lines:

(7.4.2) 

For example,  if both ends of a TEM  line of  length D are open-circuited,  then  I(z) = 0 at z = 
0 and z = D.  Evaluating (7.4.1) at z = 0 yields V- = V+.  At the other boundary:36

(7.4.3) 

To satisfy (7.4.3), sin(2πD/λ) = 0, and so λ is restricted to specific resonances: 

λ = 2D n = c f n  for n = 0,1,2,3,... 
n 

(7.4.4)

That  is,  at  resonance  the  length  of  this  open-circuited  line  is  D  =  nλn/2,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
7.4.1(a) for n = 1.  The corresponding resonant frequencies are: 

] 
[
f n  = λ = nc 2D   Hz
c n 

 

(7.4.5)

By our definition, static storage of electric or magnetic energy corresponds to a resonance at zero 
frequency.  For example, in this case the line can hold a static charge and store electric energy at 
zero  frequency  (n = 0) because  it  is open-circuited at both ends.   Because  the different modes of 
a  resonator  are  spatially  orthogonal,  the  total  energy  stored  in  a  resonator  is  the  sum  of  the 
energies stored in each of the resonances separately, as shown later in (7.4.20). 

36 We use the identity sinφ = (ejφ - e-jφ)/2j.

For  n  =  0  the  zero-frequency  solution  for  Figure  7.4.1(a)  corresponds  to  the  line  being 
charged  to  a  DC  voltage  Vo  with  zero  current.   The  electric  energy  stored  on  the  line  is  then

The extra factor of 1/2  in  the right-hand  term of (7.4.11) results because 
zero  frequencies.  A  transmission  line  short-circuited  at  both  ends  also  has  a  zero-frequency 
resonance  corresponding  to  a  steady  current  flowing  around  the  line  through  the  two  short 
circuits  at  the  ends,  and  the  voltage  across  the  line  is  zero  everywhere.37   The  circuit  of  Figure 
7.4.1(b)  cannot  store  energy  at  zero  frequency,  however,  and  therefore  has  no  zero-frequency 
resonance. 

There  is  also  a  simple  relation  between  the  electric  and  magnetic  energy  storage  in 
resonators because Zo = (L/C)0.5 (7.1.31).  Using (7.4.11), (7.4.6), and (7.4.8) for n > 0:

Integrating  these  two  time-average  energy  densities  We   and  Wm   over  the  length  of  a  TEM 
resonator  yields  the  important  result  that  at  any  resonance  the  total  time-average  stored  electric 
and  magnetic  energies  we  and  wm  are  equal;  the  fact  that  the  lengths  of  all  open-  and/or  short-
circuited  TEM  resonators  are  integral  multiples  of  a  quarter  wavelength  λn  is  essential  to  this 
result.  Energy  conservation  also  requires  this  because  periodically  the  current  or  voltage  is 
everywhere  zero  together  with  the  corresponding  energy;  the  energy  thus  oscillates  between 
magnetic and electric forms at twice fn. 

All resonators, not just TEM, exhibit equality between their time-average stored electric and 
magnetic  energies.    This  can  be  proven  by  integrating  Poynting’s  theorem  (2.7.24)  over  the 
volume of any resonator for the case where the surface integral of  S • nˆ  and the power dissipated 
Pd are zero:38

37 Some workers prefer not to consider the zero-frequency case as a resonance; by our definition it is. 
38 We assume here that μ and ε are real quantities so W is real too. 

- 216 -


This proof also applies, for example, to TEM resonators terminated by capacitors or inductors, in 
which case the reactive energy in the termination must be balanced by the line, which then is not 
an integral number of quarter wavelengths long. 

Any  system  with  spatially  distributed  energy  storage  exhibits  multiple  resonances.    These 
resonance  modes  are  generally  orthogonal  so  the  total  stored  energy  is  the  sum  of  the  separate 
energies for each mode, as shown below for TEM lines. 

Consider first the open-ended TEM resonator of Figure 7.4.1(a), for which the voltage of the 
nth mode, following (7.4.7), might be:

Since  the  time  average  electric  and  magnetic  energies  in  any  resonant  mode  are  equal,  the 
total  energy  is  twice  the  value  given  in  (7.4.21).    Thus  the  total  energy  wT  stored  on  this  TEM 
line  is  the  sum  of  the  energies  stored  in  each  resonant  mode  separately  because  all  m≠n  cross 
terms  in  (7.4.20)  integrate  to  zero.    Superposition  of  energy  applies  here  because  all  TEMm 
resonant  modes  are  spatially  orthogonal.    The  same  is  true  for  any  TEM  resonator  terminated 
with  short  or  open  circuits.    Although  spatial  orthogonality  may  not  apply  to  the  resonator  of 
Figure  7.4.2(a),  which  is  terminated  with  a  lumped  reactance,  the  modes  are  still  orthogonal 
because  they  have  different  frequencies,  and  integrating  vm(t)vn(t)  over  time  also  yields  zero  if 
m≠n.

Other types of resonator also generally have orthogonal resonant modes, so that in general:

(7.4.22) 

If  a  TEM  resonator  is  terminated  with  a  reactive  impedance  such  as  jωL  or  1/jωC,  then 
energy is still trapped but the resonant frequencies are non-uniformly distributed.  Figure 7.4.2(a) 
illustrates a  lossless  short-circuited TEM  line of  length D  that  is  terminated with  an  inductor Lo. 
Boundary  conditions  immediately  yield  an  expression  for  the  resonant  frequencies  ωn.  The 
impedance of the inductor is jωLo and that of the TEM line follows from (7.3.6) for ZL = 0:

(7.4.23)

Since  the  current  I  and  voltage  V  at  the  inductor  junction  are  the  same  for  both  the 
transmission line and the inductor, their ratios must also be the same except that we define I to be 
flowing out of the inductor into the TEM line, which changes the sign of +jωLo; so:

The  values  of  ωn  that  satisfy  (7.4.25)  are  represented  graphically  in  Figure  7.4.2(b),  and  are 
spaced non-uniformly in frequency.  The resonant frequency ωo = 0 corresponds to direct current 
and pure magnetic energy storage.  Figure 7.4.2(b) yields ωn for a line shorted at both ends when 
Lo = 0, and  shows  that  for  small values of Lo  (perturbations)  that  the shift  in  resonances Δωn are 
linear in Lo. 

We generally  can  tune  resonances  to nearby  frequencies by  changing  the  resonator  slightly. 
Section  9.4.2  derives  the  following  expression  (7.4.26)  for  the  fractional  change  Δf/f  in  any 
resonance  f  as  a  function  of  the  incremental  increases  in  average  electric  (Δωe)  and  magnetic

(Δωm) energy storage  and, equivalently, in terms of the incremental volume that was added to or 
subtracted from the structure, where We and Wm are the electric and magnetic energy densities in 
that added (+Δvvol) or removed (-Δvvol) volume, and wT is the total energy associated with f.  The 
energy  densities  can  be  computed  using  the  unperturbed  values  of  field  strength  to  obtain 
approximate answers. 

Δf f  =  Δ (  w e − Δ w m ) w T  = Δ vol

(We − Wm ) w T   
 

(frequency perturbation) 

(7.4.26) 

A simple example  illustrates  its use.   Consider  the TEM  resonator of Figure 7.4.2(a), which 
is approximately short-circuited at the left end except for a small tuning inductance Lo having an 
impedance  |jωL|  << Zo.  How  does Lo  affect  the  resonant  frequency  f1?  One  approach  is  to  use 
(7.4.25)  or  Figure  7.4.2(b)  to  find  wn.  Alternatively,  we  may  use  (7.4.26)  to  find  Δf  =  -  f1  × 
Δwm/wT , where f1  ≅  c/λ ≅  c/2D and Δwm = Lo|I'|2/4 = |V'|2/4ω2L, where I' and V' are exact.  But 
the  unperturbed  voltage  at  the  short-circuited  end  of  the  resonator  is  zero,  so  we  must  use  I' 
because perturbation  techniques  require  that only  small  fractional changes exist  in parameters  to 
be computed, and a  transition from zero  to any other value  is not a perturbation.   Therefore Δwm 
=  Lo|Io|2/4.  To  cancel  |Io|2  in  the  expression  for  Δf,  we  compute  wT  in  terms  of  voltage:

7.4.3  Resonator losses and Q 

All  resonators  dissipate  energy  due  to  resistive  losses,  leakage,  and  radiation.    Since  dissipation 
is proportional  to  resonator energy content and  to  the  squares of  current or voltage,  the decay of 
field strength and stored energy is generally exponential in time.  Each resonant frequency fn has 
its  own  rate  of  energy  decay,  characterized  by  the  dimensionless  quality  factor  Qn,  which  is 
generally  the  number  of  radians ωnt  required  for  the  total  energy wTn  stored  in mode  n  to  decay 
by a factor of 1/e: 

w Tn ( )t  = w Tn 0 e−ωn t Qn  [ ]
J 

Qn is easily related to Pn, the power dissipated by mode n: 

Pn  ≅ −dw

= ω n w Tn
 

Q n  [W ] 
 

(7.4.28) 

(7.4.29) 

Qn  ≅ ωn w Tn

 Pn 

(quality factor Q) 

(7.4.30) 

The  rate  of  decay  for  each  mode  depends  on  the  location  of  the  resistive  or  radiating  elements 
relative  to  the  peak  currents  or  voltages  for  that  mode.    For  example,  if  a  resistive  element 

- 219 -


experiences  a  voltage  or  current  null,  there  is  no  dissipation.    These  relations  apply  to  all 
resonators, for example, RLC resonators: (3.5.20–23). 

Whether a resonator is used as a band-pass or band-stop filter, it has a bandwidth Δω within 
which  more  than  half  the  peak  power  is  passed  or  stopped,  respectively.    This  half-power 
bandwidth Δω is simply related to Q by (3.5.36): 

nQ 

n≅ ω 

nΔω 

(7.4.31) 

The concept and utility of Q and the use of resonators in circuits are developed further in Section 
7.4.4. 

Loss in TEM lines arises because the wires are resistive or because the medium between the 
wires  conducts  slightly.    In  addition,  lumped  resistances may  be  present,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
7.4.3(b) and  (d).  If  these  resistances do not significantly perturb  the  lossless voltage and current 
distributions, then the power dissipated and Q of each resonance ωn can be easily estimated using 
perturbation techniques.  The perturbation method simply involves computing power dissipation 
using  the  voltages  or  currents  appropriate  for  the  lossless  case  under  the  assumption  that  the 
fractional  change  induced  by  the  perturbing  element  is  small  (perturbations  of  zero-valued 
parameters  are  not  allowed).    The  examples  below  illustrate  that  perturbing  resistances  can  be 
either very large or very small.

Thus  Q1  ≅ Zo/R1  and  is  high  when  R1  <<  Zo;  in  this  case  R1  is  truly  a  perturbation,  so  our 
solution is valid. 

A  more  interesting  case  involves  the  loss  introduced  by  R2  in  Figure  7.4.3(b)  when  R1  is 
zero.  Since  the  unperturbed  shunting  current  at  that  position  on  the  line  is  zero,  we  must  use 
instead  the unperturbed voltage v(z,t)  to estimate P1 for mode 1, where  that nominal  line voltage

In  the  same  fashion  Q  can  be  found  for  the  loss  perturbations  of  Figure  7.4.3(d).    For

In this case R3 is a perturbation if R3 >> Zo.  Most R4 values are also perturbations provided δ << 
D, similar  to  the situation for R2, because any resistance  in series with a nearby open circuit will 
dissipate little power because the currents there are so small.

7.4.4  Coupling to resonators 

Depending  on  how  resonators  are  coupled  to  circuits,  they  can  either  pass  or  stop  a  band  of 
frequencies  of  width  ~Δωn  centered  on  a  resonant  frequency  ωn.  This  effect  can  be  total  or 
partial; that is, there might be total rejection of signals either near resonance or far away, or only 
a  partial  enhancement  or  attenuation.    This  behavior  resembles  that  of  the  series  and  parallel 
RLC resonators discussed in Section 3.5.2. 

Figure  7.4.4  shows  how  both  series  and  parallel RLC  resonators  can  block  all  the  available 
power  to  the  load  resistor  RL  near  resonance,  and  similar  behavior  can  be  achieved  with  TEM 
resonators  as  suggested  below;  these  are  called  band-stop  filters.  Alternatively,  both  series  and 
parallel  RLC  resonators  can  pass  to  the  load  resistor  the  band  near  resonance,  as  suggested  in 
Figure 3.5.3;  these are called band-pass  filters.  In Figure 7.4.4(a)  the series LC  resonator  shorts 
out  the  load  R  near  resonance,  while  in  (b)  the  parallel  LC  resonator  open-circuits  the  load 
conductance G; the resonant band is stopped in both cases.

The half-power width Δω of each resonance is inversely proportional to the loaded Q, where 
QL was defined  in  (3.5.40), PDE  is  the power dissipated  externally  (in  the  source  resistance RTh), 
and PDI is the power dissipated internally (in the load R):

  When  ω  =  (LC)-0.5  the  LC  resonators  are  either  open-  or  short-circuit,  leaving  only  the 
source  and  load  resistors,  RTh  and  RL.  At  the  frequency  f  of  maximum  power  transfer  the 
fraction  of  the  available  power  that  can  be  passed  to  the  load  is  determined  by  the  ratio  Zn'  = 
RL/RTh.  For example, if the power source were a TEM transmission line of impedance Zo  ≡ RTh, 
then the minimum fraction of incident power reflected from the load (7.2.22) would be: 

−  ) (Zn '+ 1) 2 
2Γ = (Z ' 1  
n 

(7.4.43)

The  fraction  reflected  is  zero  only when  the  normalized  load  resistance  Zn'  =  1,  i.e., when  RL  = 
RTh.  Whether  the  maximum  transfer  of  power  to  the  load  occurs  at  resonance  ωn  (band-pass 
filter)  or  only  at  frequencies  removed  more  than  ~Δω  from  ωn  (band-stop  filter)  depends  on 
whether  the current  is blocked or passed at ωn by  the LC portion of  the  resonator.   For example, 
Figures  3.5.3  and  7.4.4  illustrate  two  forms  of  band-pass  and  band-stop  filter  circuits, 
respectively. 

Resonators  can  be  constructed  using  TEM  lines  simply  by  terminating  them  at  both  ends 
with  impedances  that  reflect  most  or  all  incident  power  so  that  energy  remains  largely  trapped 
inside,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  7.4.5(a).    Because  the  load  resistance  RL  is  positioned  close  to  a 
short circuit (δ << λ/4), the voltage across RL is very small and little power escapes, even if RL  ≅ 
Zo.  The Q  for  the ω1  resonance  is easily calculated by using  (7.4.40) and  the expression  for  line 
voltage (7.4.36):

Adjustment of δ enables achievement of any desired Q for any given RL  in an otherwise  lossless 
system.  If we regard RL as internal to the resonator then the Q calculated above is the internal Q, 
QI.

Figure 7.4.5  Coupled TEM resonator. 
 

We may  connect  this  resonator  externally  by  adding  a  feed  line  at  a  short  distance  δ2  from 
its  left  end,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  7.4.5(b).    If  the  feed  line  is  matched  at  its  left  end  then  the 
external Q,  QE,  associated with  power  dissipated  there  is  given  by  (7.4.45)  for  δ  =  δ2  and  RL  = 
Zo.  By adjusting δ2 any QE can be obtained.  Figures 3.5.3 and 7.4.4 suggest how the equivalent 
circuits  for  either  band-pass  or  band-stop  filters  can match  all  the  available  power  to  the  load  if 
RTh  =  RL  and  therefore QE  = QI.  Thus  all  the  available  power  can  be  delivered  to  RL  in  Figure 
7.4.5(b)  for  any  small  δ1  by  selecting  δ2  properly;  if  δ2  yields  a  perfect match  at  resonance,  we 
have  a  critically  coupled  resonator.  If  δ2  is  larger  than  the  critically  coupled  value,  then  the 
input transmission line is too strongly coupled, QE < QI, and we have an over-coupled resonator; 
conversely,  smaller values of  δ2 yield QE > QI  and undercoupling.  The bandwidth of  this band-
pass filter Δω is related to the loaded Q, QL, as defined in (7.4.41) where: 

−1 + QE 
−1 = Q I 
−1 = Δω ω 
QL 

(7.4.46) 

If the band-pass filter of Figure 7.4.5(b) is matched at resonance so QE = QI, it therefore has 
a  bandwidth  Δω  =  2ω/QI,  where  QI  is  given  by  (7.4.39)  and  is  determined  by  our  choice  of  δ1. 
Smaller values of δ1 yield higher values for QL and narrower bandwidths Δω.  In the special case 
where  RL  corresponds  to  another  matched  transmission  line  with  impedance  Zo,  then  a  perfect 
match at resonance results here when δ1 = δ2. 

Many  variations  of  the  coupling  scheme  in  Figure  7.4.5  exist.    For  example,  the  feed  line 
and  resonator can be  isolated by a  shunt consisting of a  large capacitor or  a  small  inductor, both 
approximating  short  circuits  relative  to  Zo,  or  by  a  high-impedance  block  consisting  of  a  small 
capacitor  or  large  inductor  in  series.    Alternatively,  an  external  feed  line  can  be  connected  in 
place  of R4  in Figure  7.4.3(d).    In  each weakly  coupled  case  perturbation methods  quickly  yield 
QI and QE, and therefore QL, Δω, and the impedance at resonance. 

The  impedance  at  resonance  can  be  found  once  QE,  QI,  and  Zo  for  the  feedline  are  known, 
and  once  it  is  known  whether  the  resonance  is  a  series  or  parallel  resonance.    Referring  to 
Figures 3.5.3 and 7.4.4 for equivalent circuits for band-pass and band-stop filters, respectively, it 
is  clear  that  if  QE  =  QI,  then  band-pass  resonators  are  matched  at  resonance  while  band-stop 
series-resonance  resonators are short circuits and parallel-resonance resonators are open circuits. 
Away from resonance band-pass resonators become open circuits for series resonances and short 
circuits for parallel resonances, while both types of band-stop resonator become matched loads if 
QE  =  QI.  At  resonance  all  four  types  of  resonator  have  purely  real  impedances  and  reflection 
coefficients Γ that can readily be found by examining the four equivalent circuits cited above.

Sometimes unintended resonances can disrupt systems.   For example, consider a waveguide 
that can propagate  two modes, only one of which  is desired.   If a  little bit of  the unwanted mode 
is  excited  at  one  end  of  the  waveguide,  but  cannot  escape  through  the  lines  connected  at  each 
end,  then  the second mode  is  largely  trapped and behaves as a weakly coupled resonator with its 
own  losses.    At  each  of  its  resonances  it  will  dissipate  energy  extracted  from  the  main 
waveguide.  If  the  internal  losses  happen  to  cause  QE  =  QI  for  these  parasitic  resonances,  no 
matter  how  weakly  coupled  they  are,  they  can  appear  as  a  matched  load  positioned  across  the 
main  line;  dissipation  by  parasitic  resonances  declines  as  their  internal  and  external  Q’s 
increasingly differ. 

The ability of a weakly coupled  resonance  to have a powerful external effect arises because 
the  field  strengths  inside  a  low-loss  resonator  can  rise  to  values  far  exceeding  those  in  the 
external circuit.   For example,  the critically coupled resonator of Figure 7.4.5(b) for RL = Zo and 
δ1  =  δ2,  has  internal  voltages  v(z,t)  = Vosinωt  sin(πz/D)  given  by  (7.4.44), where  the maximum 
terminal  voltage  is  only  Vosin(πδ/D)  ≅  Voπδ/D  <<  Vo.  Thus  a  parasitic  resonance  can  slowly 
absorb energy  from  its surroundings at  its  resonant  frequency until  its  internal  fields build  to  the 
point  that  even  with  weak  coupling  it  has  a  powerful  effect  on  the  external  fields  and  thus 
reaches an equilibrium value.  It is these potentially extremely strong resonant fields that enables 
critically  coupled  resonators  to  couple  energy  into  poorly  matched  loads--the  fields  in  the 
resonator  build  until  the  power  dissipated  in  the  load  equals  the  available  power  provided.    In 
some  cases  the  fields  can  build  to  the  point  where  the  resonator  arcs  internally,  as  can  happen 
with an empty microwave oven without an extra internal load to prevent it. 

This  analysis  of  the  resonant  behavior  of  TEM  lines  is  approximate  because  the  resonator 
length measured  in wavelengths  is  a  function  of  frequency within  Δω,  so  exact  answers  require 
use  the  TEM  analysis  methods  of  Sections  7.2–3,  particularly  when  Δω  becomes  a  non-trivial 
fraction of the frequency difference between adjacent resonances. 

Example 7.4B 
Consider  a  variation  of  the  coupled  resonator  of  Figure  7.4.5(b)  where  the  resonator  is  open-
circuited at both ends and the weakly coupled external connections at δ1 and δ2 from the ends are 
in  series with  the  100-ohm TEM  resonator  line  rather  than  in  parallel.    Find  δ1  and  δ2  for: QL = 
100, Zo = 100 ohms for both  the feed  line and resonator, RL = 50 ohms, and  the resonator  length 
is D ≅ λ/2, where λ is the wavelength within the resonator. 

Solution:	 For  critical  coupling, QE  = QI,  so  the  resonator  power  lost  to  the  input  line,  |I2|2Zo/2, 
|I1|2RL/2,  and 
must  equal 
that 
lost 
to 
the 
load, 
therefore 
|I1|/|I2|  = 
(Zo/RL)0.5 = 20.5.  Since  the λ/2  resonance of an open-circuited TEM  line has  I(z) ≅  Io 
sin(πz/D)  ≅ πz/D  for  δ  << D/π  (high Q),  therefore  |I1|/|I2|  =  [sin(πδ1/D)]/[sin(πδ2/D)] 
≅ δ1/δ2  ≅  20.5.  Also, QL  =  100  =  0.5×QI  =  0.5ωowT/PDI, where: ωo  =  2πfo  =  2πc/λ  = 
D(L|I|2/4)dz  ≅  LIo
2D/4;  and  PDI  = 
|I(δ1)|2RL/2  = 
πc/D;  wT  =  2wm  =  2∫0
2sin2(πδ1/D)RL/2  ≅  (Ioπδ1/D)2RL/2. 
 
Therefore  QI  =  ωowT/PDI  =  200  = 
Io
2D/4)/[(Ioπδ1/D)2RL/2] = (D/δ1)2(Zo/RL)/π, where cL = Zo = 100.  Thus δ1 = 
(πc/D)(LIo
π-0.5D/10 and δ2 = δ12-0.5 = (2π)-0.5D/10.

7.4.5  Transients in TEM resonators 

TEM  and  cavity  resonators  have  many  resonant  modes,  all  of  which  can  be  energized 
simultaneously,  depending  on  initial  conditions.    Because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  the 
total fields can be characterized as  the  linear superposition of  fields associated with each excited 
mode.  This  section  illustrates  how  the  relative  excitation  of  each  TEM  resonator  mode  can  be 
determined  from any given set of  initial conditions, e.g.  from v(z,  t = 0) and  i(z,  t = 0), and how 
the  voltage  and  current  subsequently  evolve.    The  same  general  method  applies  to  modal 
excitation  of  cavity  resonators.  By  using  a  similar  orthogonality  method  to  match  boundary 
conditions in space rather than in time, the modal excitation of waveguides and optical fibers can 
be found, as discussed in Section 9.3.3. 

The central concept developed below is that any initial condition in a TEM resonator at time 
zero can be replicated by superimposing some weighted set of voltage and current modes.   Once 
the phase and magnitudes of those modes are known, the voltage and current are then known for 
all  time.    The  key  solution  step  uses  the  fact  that  the mathematical  functions  characterizing  any 
two  different  modes  a  and  b,  e.g.  the  voltage  distributions  Va(z)  and  Vb(z),  are  spatially

Consider  the  open-circuited  TEM  resonator  of  Figure  7.4.3(c),  for which Vn- = Vn+  for  any 
mode n because the reflection coefficient at the open circuit at z = 0 is +1.  The resulting voltage 
and current on the resonator for mode n are:39

We note  that  these  two equations permit us  to solve for both  the real and  imaginary parts of 
Vn+,  and  therefore  for  v(z,t)  and  i(z,t).    Using  spatial  orthogonality  of  modes,  we  multiply  both 
sides of (7.4.49) by cos(mπz/D) and integrate over the TEM line length D, where kn = nπz/D:

where δmn  ≡ 0  if m ≠ n, and δmn  ≡ 1  if m = n.   Orthogonality of modes  thus enables  this  integral

In  general,  each  resonator  mode  decays  exponentially  at  its  own  natural  rate,  until  only  the 
longest-lived mode remains. 

As discussed in Section 9.3.3, the relative excitation of waveguide modes by currents can be 
determined in a similar fashion by expressing the fields in a waveguide as the sum of modes, and 
then  matching  the  boundary  conditions  imposed  by  the  given  excitation  currents  at  the  spatial 
origin  (not  time  origin).    The  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the  amplitudes  characterizing  each 
waveguide propagation mode can  then be determined by multiplying both sides of  this boundary 
equation by spatial sines or cosines corresponding to the various modes, and integrating over the 
surface defining the boundary at z = 0.  Arbitrary spatial excitation currents generally excite both 
propagating and evanescent modes  in  some  combination.   Far  from  the  excitation point only  the

propagating  modes  are  evident,  while  the  evanescent  modes  are  evident  principally  as  a 
reactance seen by the current source.

Chapter 8:  Fast Electronics and Transient Behavior on TEM Lines 

Propagation  and  reflection  of  transient  signals  on  TEM  transmission 

8.1 
lines 

8.1.1  Lossless transmission lines 

The  speed  of  computation  and  signal  processing  is  limited  by  the  time  required  for  charges  to 
move  within  and  between  devices,  and  by  the  time  required  for  signals  to  propagate  between 
elements.    If  the  devices  partially  reflect  incoming  signals  there  can  be  additional  delays  while 
the  resulting  reverberations  fade.   Finally,  signals may  distort  as  they  propagate,  smearing  pulse 
shapes  and  arrival  times.    These  three  sources  of  delay,  i.e.,  propagation  plus  reverberation, 
device  response  times,  and  signal  distortion  are  discussed  in  Sections  8.1,  8.2,  and  8.3, 
respectively.   These  same  issues  apply  to  any  system  combining  transmission  lines  and  circuits, 
such  as  integrated  analog  or  digital  circuits,  printed  circuit  boards,  interconnections  between 
circuits or antennas, and electrical power lines. 

Transmission  lines  are  usually  paired  parallel  conductors  that  convey  signals  between 
devices.  They  are  fundamental  to  every  electronic  system,  from  integrated  circuits  to  large 
systems.    Section  7.1.2  derived  from  Maxwell’s  equations  the  behavior  of  transverse 
electromagnetic  (TEM) waves  propagating  between  parallel  plate  conductors,  and  Section  7.1.3 
showed  that  the  same  equations  also  govern  any  structure,  even  a  dissipative  one,  for which  the 
cross-section  is  constant  along  its  length  and  that has  at  least  two perfectly  conducting  elements 
between  which  the  exciting  voltage  is  applied.    Using  differential  RLC  circuit  elements,  this 
section below derives the same transmission-line behavior in a form that can readily be extended 
to  transmission  lines  with  resistive  wires,  as  discussed  later  in  Section  8.3.1.    Since  resistive 
wires introduce longitudinal electric fields, such lines are no longer pure TEM lines. 

Equations  (7.1.10)  and  (7.1.11)  characterized  the  voltage  v(t,z)  and  current  i(t,z)  on  TEM 
structures with inductance L [H m-1] and capacitance C [F m-1] as: 

dv dz = −L di dt 

di dz = −C dv dt 

(8.1.1) 

(8.1.2) 

These expressions were combined to yield the wave equation (7.1.14) for lossless TEM lines:

v ( z, t ) = v+ ( z − ct ) + v− ( z + ct )  

(TEM voltage) 

(8.1.4) 

- 229 -


which  corresponds  to  the  superposition  of  forward  and  backward  propagating  waves  moving  at 
velocity  c  =  (LC)-0.5  =  (με)-0.5 .  The  current  i(t,z)  corresponding  to  (8.1.4)  follows  from 
substitution of (8.1.4) into (8.1.1) or (8.1.2), and differentiation followed by integration: 

) = Yo  ⎡⎣ v+ ( z − ct  ) − v− ( z + ct  )⎤⎦

Yo is the characteristic admittance of the line, and the reciprocal of the characteristic impedance 
Zo:

] 

 

(characteristic impedance of lossless TEM line) 

(8.1.6) 

The value of Yo follows directly from the steps above. 

A more  intuitive way  to  derive  these  equations  utilizes  an  equivalent  distributed  circuit  for 
the  transmission  line  composed  of  an  infinite  number  of  differential  elements  with  series 
inductance  and  parallel  capacitance,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.1(a).    This  model  is  easily 
extended to non-TEM lines with resistive wires.

The  inductance  L  [Henries  m-1]  of  the  two  conductors  arises  from  the  magnetic  energy 
stored per meter of  length,  and produces  a voltage drop dv  across  each  incremental  length dz of 
wire which is proportional to the time derivative of current through it40: 

dv = −L dz ( di dt ) 

(8.1.7) 

Any  current  increase  di  across  the  distance  dz,  defined  as  di  =  i(t,  z+dz)  -  i(t,z),  would  be 
supplied from charge stored in C [F m-1]: 

40  An  alternate  equivalent  circuit  would  have  a  second  inductor  in  the  lower  branch  equivalent  to  that  in  the  upper 
branch; both would have value Ldz/2, and v(t,z) and i(t,z) would remain the same. 

- 230 -


di = −C dz ( dv dt ) 

(8.1.8) 

These  two  equations  for dv  and di  are  equivalent  to  (8.1.1) and  (8.1.2),  respectively, and  lead  to 
the  same  wave  equation  and  general  solutions  derived  in  Section  7.1.2  and  summarized  above, 
where  arbitrary  waveforms  propagate  down  TEM  lines  in  both  directions  and  superimpose  to 
produce the total v(z,t) and i(t,z). 

Two equivalent solutions exist for this wave equation: (8.1.4) and (8.1.9): 

v ( z, t  ) = f + ( t − z c ) + f − ( t + z c ) 

(8.1.9) 

The validity of (8.1.9) is easily shown by substitution into the wave equation (8.1.3), where again 
c = (LC)-0.5 .  This alternate form is useful when relating line signals to sources or loads for which 
z  is  constant,  as  illustrated  below.  The  first  form  (8.1.4)  in  terms  of  (z  -  ct)  is more  convenient 
when t is constant and z varies. 

Waves can be launched on TEM lines as suggested in Figure 8.1.1(b).  The line is driven by 
the Thevenin  equivalent  source vs(t)  in  series with  the  source  resistance Zo, which  is matched  to 
the  transmission  line  in  this  case.    Equations  (8.1.4)  and  (8.1.5)  say  that  if  there  is  no  negative 
traveling  wave,  then  the  ratio  of  the  voltage  to  current  for  the  forward  wave  on  the  line  must 
-1.  The  equivalent  circuit  for  this TEM  line  is  therefore  simply  a  resistor  of  value 
equal Zo  = Yo
Zo,  as  suggested  in Figure  8.1.1(c).    If  the  source  resistance  is  also Zo,  then  only  half  the  source 
voltage  vs(t)  appears  across  the  TEM  line  terminals  at  z  =  0.    Therefore  the  voltages  at  the  left 
terminals (z = 0) and on the line v(t,z) are:

(8.1.10) 

(transmitted signal) 

(8.1.11) 

where  we  have  used  the  solution  form  of  (8.1.9).    The  propagating  wave  in  Figure  8.1.1(b)  has 
half  the amplitude of  the Thevenin  source vs(t) because  the source was matched  to  the  line so as 
to maximize the power transmitted from the given voltage vs(t).  Note that (8.1.11) is the same as 
(8.1.10)  except  that  z/c  was  subtracted  from  each.    Equality  is  preserved  if  all  arguments  in  an 
equation are shifted the same amount. 

If  the Thevenin  source  resistance were R,  then  the voltage-divider equation would yield  the 
terminal and propagating voltage v(t,z): 

) = vs ( t − z c  )⎡⎣Zo  (R + Zo )⎤⎦ 
(
v t ,z  

(8.1.12) 

This more general expression reduces to (8.1.10) when R = Zo and z = 0.

Example 8.1A 
A  certain  integrated  circuit  with  μ  =  μo  propagates  signals  at  velocity  c/2,  and  its  TEM  wires 
exhibit Zo = 100 ohms.  What are ε, L, and C for these TEM lines? 

Solution:	 c =  (μoε0)-0.5,  and v =  c/2 =  (μoε)-0.5;  so  ε = 4εo.  Since v =  (LC)-0.5  and Zo =  (L/C)0.5,

If  a  transmission  line  connecting  a  source  to  a  load  is  sufficiently  short,  then  the  effects  of  the 
line  on  reflections  can  be  modeled  by  simply  replacing  it  with  a  small  lumped  capacitor  across 
the source  terminals  representing  the capacitance between  the wires, and a  resistor  in series with 
an  inductor  and  the  load,  representing  the  resistance  and  inductance  of  the  wires.    If,  however, 
the  line  length  D  is  such  that  the  propagation  time  τline  =  D/c  is  a  non-trivial  fraction  of  the 
shortest  time constant of  the  load τload,  then we should use  transmission  line models governed by 
the wave  equation  (e.g.,  8.1.3).    That  is,  the  TEM wave  equation  should  be  used  unless  the  line 
length D is: 

D (cid:19) cτload	

(8.1.13) 

For  larger  values  of  D  the  propagation  delays  become  important  and  a  transmission  line 
model must be used, as explained  in Section 8.1.1.   Section 8.1.1 also explained how signals are 
launched  and  propagate  on  TEM  lines,  and  how  the  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  (8.1.6)  for  a 
passive  transmission  line  as  seen  by  the  source  is  simply  a  resistor  Zo  =  (L/C)0.5.  This 
characteristic  impedance  Zo of  the  transmission  line  is  the  ratio of  the  forward voltage v+(t,z)  to 
the associated current i+(z,t).  TEM signals are partially transmitted and partially reflected at each 
junction  they encounter, where  these  junctions may be  the  intended  load or  simply places where 
the  impedance Zo of  the  transmission  line changes.   Sometimes multiple  transmission  lines meet 
at such junctions. 

Section  7.2.2  (7.2.7)  derived  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ for  an  arbitrary  TEM  wave  v+(t,z) 
reflected by a load resistance R at z, where the normalized impedance of the load is Rn = R/Zo:

It  is  important  to  distinguish  the  difference  between  Γ  for  purely  resistive  loads,  which  is  real, 
and  Γ(ω), which  is  complex  and  applies  to  any  complex  load  impedance  ZL.  Here R  and  Γ are 
real.

Consider  the  example  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.2(a),  where  a  TEM  line  is  characterized  by 
impedance Zo and phase velocity c.  The line is D meters long, open circuit at the right-hand end, 
and  driven  by  a  unit-step41  voltage  u(t).  The  equivalent  circuit  at  the  source  end  of  the  line  is 
illustrated  in  (b), which  is  simply  a  voltage  divider  that  places  vs(t)/2  volts  across  the  line.    But 
the  voltage  across  the  line  equals  the  sum  of  the  forward  and  backward moving waves, where  a 
passive  line at  rest has no backward wave.   Therefore  the  forward wave here at z = 0+  is  simply 
u(t)/2, and the result is a voltage of 0.5 volts that moves down the line at velocity c, as illustrated 
in  Figure  8.1.2(c)  for  t  =  to.  The  associated  current  i(z,  t)  is  plotted  in  (d)  for  t  =  to,  and  is 
proportional to the voltage.

Once  the  transient  reaches  the  right-hand  end,  boundary  conditions must  again  be  satisfied, 
so  there  is  a  reflected  voltage wave  having  v-(t,  z=D)  = Γv+(t,  z=D), where Γ  =  +1,  as  given  by 
(8.1.15)  for  Rn  → ∞.  The  total  voltage  on  the  line  (8.1.9)  is  the  sum  of  the  forward  and 
backward waves,  each  of  value  0.5  volts,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.2(c)  for  t  =  t1  > D/c.  At  t1 
the  reflected  voltage  step  is  propagating  leftward  toward  the  source.    The  current  at  t  =  t1  is 
plotted in Figure 8.1.2(d). 

Although  these  voltage  and  current  transients  are  most  easily  represented  and  understood 
graphically,  they  can  also  be  derived  and  represented  algebraically.    For  example,  v(t,  z=0)  = 
u(t)/2  here,  and  therefore  for  t  <  D/c  we  have  v(t,z)  =  v+(t  -  z/c)  =  u(t  -  z/c)/2.    Note  that  if  we 
translate  an  argument  on  one  side  of  an  equation,  we  must  impose  the  same  translation  on  the 
other;  thus  v(t,0)→v(t  -  z/c)  forces  u(t,0)→u(t  -  z/c).  Once  the  wave  reflects  from  the  open 
circuit we have v(z,t) = v+(t  - z/c) + v-(t + z/c).  At z = D  for  t < 3D/c  the boundary condition at 
the open circuit  requires Γ = +1,  so v-(t + D/c) = v+(t  - D/c) = u(t  - D/c)/2.   From v-(t + D/c) we 
can  find  the  more  general  expression  v-(t  +  z/c)  simply  by  operating  on  their  arguments: 
v-(t + z/c) = v-(t + D/c –D/c + z/c) = u(t - 2D/c + z/c).  The total voltage for t < 2D/c is the sum of 
these forward and backward waves: v(t,z) = [u(t - z/c) + u(t - 2D/c + z/c)]/2.  The same approach 
can represent line currents and also more complex examples. 

41  We use  the notation u(t)  to represent a unit-step  function  that  is zero for t < 0, and unity for  t ≥ 0.  A unit  impulse 
is represented by δ(t), which is zero for all |t| > ε in the limit where ε → 0, and the integral of δ(t) ≡ 0.  ∫δ(t)dt = u(t). 

- 233 -


When  the reflected wave arrives back at  the source, Γ = 0 because  this source  is matched  to 
the  transmission  line.    In  this  special  case  there  are  no  further  reflections.    Steady  state  is 
therefore one volt on the line everywhere, with v+ = v- = 0.5 in perpetuity.   The total line current 
is  the  difference  between  the  forward  and  backward  wave  (8.1.5),  as  plotted  in  Figure  8.1.2(d) 
for t1.  The steady-state current is therefore zero.  These steady state values correspond to ω → 0 
and  λ → ∞,  so  the  line  is  then  much  shorter  than  any  wavelength  of  interest  and  can  be 
considered  static.  We  can  easily  see  that  an  open-circuit  line  connected  to  a  voltage  source  via 
any  impedance at all will eventually assume  the same voltage as  the source, and  the current will 
be zero, as it is here. 

If  the  line  were  short-circuited  at  the  right-hand  end,  then  Γ  =  -1  and  the  voltage  v(z)  at  t1 
would  resemble  that  of  the  current  in  Figure  8.1.2(d), with  the  values  0.5  and  0  volts, while  the 
current  i(z)  at  t1 would  resemble  that of  the voltage  in  (c), with  the values 0.5/Zo  and 1/Zo.  The 
steady  state  values  for  voltage  and  current  in  this  short-circuit  case  are  zero  and  1/Zo, 
respectively. 

If  the  first  transmission  line  were  connected  to  a  second  passive  infinite  line  of  impedance 
Zb,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.3(a),  then  the  same  computations  would  yield  v(t,z)  and  i(t,z)  on 
the  first  transmission  line,  where  Rn  =  Zb/Zo.    The  solution  on  the  second  line  follows  from  the 
boundary  conditions:  v(t)  and  i(t)  are  both  continuous  across  the  boundary.    The  resulting 
waveforms v(t1,z) and i(t1,z) at time D/c < t1 < 2D/c are plotted in Figure 8.1.3(b) for the case Rn 
=  0.5,  so  Γ  =  -  1/3.    In  this  case  the  current  is  increased  by  the  reflection  while  the  voltage  is 
diminished.    Independent  of  the  incident  waveform,  the  fraction  of  the  incident  power  that  is 
reflected  is  (v-/v+)2  =  Γ2, where  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ  is  given  by  (8.1.15);  the  transmitted 
fraction is 1 - Γ2.

The principal consequence of  this  reflection phenomenon  is  that  the voltage across a device 
may not be what was  intended  if  there  is an impedance mismatch between  the TEM  line and  the 
device.  This is an issue only when the line is sufficiently long that line delays are non-negligible

compared  to  circuit  time  constants  (8.1.13).   The  analysis  above  is  for  linear  resistive  loads,  but 
most loads are non-linear or reactive, and their treatment is discussed in Section 8.1.4. 

8.1.3  Multiple reflections and reverberations 

The  reflected waves  illustrated  in  Figures  8.1.2  and  8.1.3  eventually  impact  the  source  and may 
be  reflected  yet  again.  Since  superposition  applies  if  the  sources  and  loads  are  linear,  the 
contributions from each reflection can be separately determined and  then added  to yield  the  total 
voltage  and  current.  That  is,  the  reflected  v-(t,z) will  yield  its  own  reflection  at  the  source,  and 
the  fate of  this  reflection  can be  followed  independently of  the original  forward wave.   As usual 
when analyzing linear circuits, all sources are set to zero when determining the contribution of an 
independent source such as v-(t,z). 

This  paradigm  is  illustrated  in  Figure  8.1.4,  which  involves  a  unit-step  current  source 
driving an open-circuited TEM line that is characterized by Zo, c, and length D.  Figures 8.1.4(a), 
(b),  and  (c)  illustrate  the  circuit,  the  voltage  at  t1,  and  the  current  at  t1,  respectively,  where  t1  = 
D/2c.  The  reflection  coefficient Γ = 1  (8.1.15)  for  the  open  circuit  at  z  = D,  so  the  incident  Zo­
volt  step  is  reflected  positively,  and  the  total  voltage  where  they  superimpose  is  2Zo  volts,  as 
illustrated in (d) for t2 = 1.5D/c.  The current at this moment is Yo[v+(t - z/c) - v-(t + z/c)], which 
is  zero  where  the  forward  and  reverse  waves  overlap,  as  illustrated  in  (e).    When  v-(t  +  z/c)  is 
reflected  from  the  left-hand  end  it  sees  Γ  =  +1  because,  when  using  superposition,  we  consider 
the  current  source  to  be  zero,  corresponding  to  an  open  circuit.    Thus  an  additional  Zo  volts, 
associated with  v+2,  adds  to  v+1  and  v-1  to  yield  a  total  of  3Zo  volts,  as  illustrated  in  (f)  at  t3;  the 
notation  v+i  refers  to  the  ith  forward  wave  v+.  This  process  continues  indefinitely,  with  the 
voltage  continuing  to  increase  by  Zo  volts  every  D/c  seconds  until  something  breaks  down. 
Voltage  breakdowns  are  expected  when  current  sources  feed  open  circuits;  the  finite  rate  of 
voltage increase is related to the total capacitance of the TEM line.

Figure 8.1.4  Transients for a current source driving an open-circuited TEM line. 
 

The  behavior  of  the  current  i(t,z)  is  interesting  too.   Figure  8.1.4(c)  illustrates  how  the  one-
ampere  current  from  the  current  source  propagates  down  the  line  at  velocity  c,  and  (e)  shows 
how  the  “message”  that  the  line  is  open-circuited  is  returned:  the  current  is  returning  to  zero. 

- 235 -


When this left-moving wave is reflected at the left-hand end the current is again forced to be one 
ampere  by  the  current  source.    Thus  the  current  distribution  (c)  also  applies  to  (f)  at  t3.  This 
oscillation  between  one  and  zero  amperes  continues  indefinitely,  much  like  an  unresolved 
argument  between  two  people,  each  end  of  the  line  forcing  the  current  to  satisfy  its  own 
boundary conditions while that message propagates back and forth at velocity c. 

Example 8.1B 
A  unit  step  voltage  source  u(t) with  no  source  resistance  drives  a  short-circuited  air-filled  TEM 
line  of  length  D  and  characteristic  impedance  Zo  =  1  ohm.   What  current  i(t)  flows  through  the 
short circuit at the end of this TEM line? 

Solution:	 The  unit  step  will  propagate  down  the  line,  be  reflected  at  the  short  circuit  at  z  =  D 
where  the  reflection  coefficient  ΓD  =  -1,  and  travel  back  to  the  voltage  source  at 
z  =  0,  which  this  transient  sees  as  a  short  circuit  (Δv  =  0),  also  having  ΓS  =  -1.  So, 
after  a  round-trip  delay  of  2D/c,  the  voltage  everywhere  on  the  line  is  zero,  after 
which  a  new  step  voltage  travels  down  the  line  and  superimposes  on  the  first  step 
voltage,  thus  adding  a  second  step  to  the  current  i(t,  z=D).    This  process  continues 
indefinitely  as  i(t)  steps  in  1-ampere  increments  every  2D/C  seconds  monotonically 
toward  infinity,  which  is  the  expected  current  when  a  voltage  source  is  short-
circuited.   The effect of  the  line  is simply  to slow  this  result as  the current and stored 
magnetic 
 
energy 
on 
the 
line 
build 
up. 
More 
precisely, 
v(t,  z=0)  ≡  u(t)  =  v+1(t,  z=0).  v+1(t,  z=D)  =  u(t  -  D/c),  so  the  TEM  line  presents  an 
equivalent circuit at z = D having Thevenin voltage vTh = 2v+1(t, D) = 2u(t - D/c), and 
Thevenin  impedance Zo;  this yields  i(t) = 2u(t - D/c)/Zo  for  t < 3D/c.  Therefore v-1(t, 
D)  =  ΓDv+1(t,  D)  = 
-u(t 
- D/c), 
so  v+2(t,  0)  =  ΓSv-1(t,  0)  = 
u(t  -  2D/c).  At  z  =  D  this  second  step  increases  the  Thevenin  voltage  by 
2u(t  -  3D/c)  and  increases  the  current  by  2u(t  -  3D/c)/Zo,  where  Zo  =  1  ohm. 
∞ 2u(t - [2n+1]D/c). 
Therefore i(t) = Σn=0 

8.1.4  Reflections by mnemonic or non-linear loads 

Most  junctions  involve  mnemonic42  or  non-linear  loads,  where  mnemonic  loads  are  capacitors, 
inductors, or other  energy  storage devices  that have  characteristics depending on  the past.   Non-
linear  loads  include  diodes,  transistors,  and  voltage-  or  current-dependent  capacitors  and 
inductors.  In either case the response to arbitrary waveforms cannot be determined by the simple 
methods  described  in  the  previous  section.    However  by  simply  replacing  the  transmission  line 
by  its  equivalent  circuit,  the  voltage  and  current  can  generally  be  easily  found,  first  at  the 
junction and then on the transmission line. 

The  equivalent  circuit  for  an  unexcited  transmission  line  is  simply  a  resistor  of  value  Zo 
because the ratio Δv/Δi for any excitation is always Zo.  Determining the voltage across this Zo is 
generally  straightforward  even  if  the  source  driving  the  line  contains  capacitors,  inductors, 

42 Mnemonic means “involving memory”.

diodes, or similar devices.  The forward-propagating wave voltage is simply the terminal voltage, 
as demonstrated in Figures 8.1.2–4. 

The  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  for  an  energized  TEM  line  has  a  Thevenin  voltage  source 
VTh  in  series  with  the  Thevenin  impedance  of  the  line:  ZTh  =  Zo.  Note  that  the  equivalent 
impedance for a TEM line is exactly Zo, regardless of any loads on the line.  The influence of the 
load  at  the  far  end  of  the  line  is  manifest  only  in  reflected  waves  that  may  propagate  from  it 
toward the observer, as discussed in the previous section. 

The  Thevenin  equivalent  voltage  of  any  linear  system  is  simply  its  open-circuit  voltage. 
The  open-circuit  voltage  of  a  transmission  line  is  twice  the  amplitude  of  any  incident  voltage 
waveform  because  the  reflection  coefficient  Γ  for  an  open  circuit  is  +1,  which  doubles  the 
incidence voltage at the junction position zJ: 

VTh ( t ,z J ) = v+ ( t ,z J ) + v− ( t ,z J ) = 2v + ( t ,z J ) 

(8.1.17) 

The procedure for analyzing a TEM line terminated by any load at z = zJ is then to: 1) solve 
for  the wave  v+(t  -  z/c)  traveling  toward  the  load  of  interest,  2)  set VTh  =  2v+(t  -  zJ/c)  and ZTh  = 
Zo, 3) solve for the terminal voltage v(t, zJ), 4) solve for v-(t,zJ), and 5) find v-(t + z/c), where we 
define z as increasing toward the load:

(wave reflected by load) 

(8.1.19)

Equation (8.1.19) says v-(t + z/c) is simply the v-(t, zJ) given by (8.1.18), but delayed by (zJ -z)/c. 

This procedure is best demonstrated by a simple example.  Figure 8.1.5(a) illustrates a TEM 
line  driven  by  a  matched  unit  step  voltage  source  and  terminated  with  a  capacitor  C.    This 
voltage  step,  reduced  by  a  factor  of  two  by  the  voltage  divider,  propagates  toward  the  capacitor 
at  velocity  c,  as  illustrated  in  (b).    The  capacitor  sees  the  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  illustrated 
in  (c);  it consists of Zo  in series with a Thevenin voltage source  that  is  twice v+, where v+(t,D)  is 
a 0.5-volt step delayed by  the propagation  time D/c.   Therefore VTh = u(t  - D/c), as  illustrated  in 
Figure  8.1.5(c)  and  (d).  The  solution  to  the  circuit  problem  of  (c)  is  the  junction  voltage  vJ(t) 
plotted  in  (e);  it  rises  exponentially  toward  its  1-volt  asymptote  with  a  time  constant  τ  =  ZoC 
seconds. 

To  solve  for v-(t,zJ) we  subtract v+(t,zJ)  from vJ(t), as  shown  in  (8.1.18) and  illustrated  in 
(f); this then yields v-(t + z/c) using (8.1.19).  The total voltage v(t1,z) on the line at time D/c < t1 
<  2D/c  is  plotted  in  (g)  and  is  the  sum  of  v+(t  -  z/c),  which  is  0.5  volts,  and  v-(t  +  z/c).  The 
corresponding  current  i(t1,z)  is  plotted  in  (h)  and  equals  Yo  times  the  difference  between  the 
forward and reverse voltage waves, as given by (8.1.5).  When v-(t,z) arrives at the source, it can 
be treated just as such waves were treated in Section 8.1.3.  In this case the source is matched, so 
there are no further reflections.

the incident waveform. 

Example 8.1C 
If  the circuit  illustrated  in Figure 8.1.5(a) were  terminated by L  instead of C, what would be v(t, 
D), v-(t, D), and  v(t,0)? 

Solution:	 Figures  8.1.5(a–d)  still  apply,  except  that  L  replaces  C.    The  one-volt  Thevenin  step 
voltage at z = D in series with the Thevenin line impedance Zo yields a voltage v(t, D) 
across  the  inductor  of  u(t  -  D/c)e-tL/R.  Therefore  v-(t,  D)  =  v(t,  D)  -  v+(t,  D)  =  u(t  -
D/c)e-(t - D/c)L/R - 0.5u(t - D/c) and, since there are no further reflections at the matched 
load at z = 0, it follows that v(t,0) = 0.5u(t) + u(t - 2D/c)e-(t - 2D/c)L/R - 0.5u(t - 2D/c). 

8.1.5 

Initial conditions and transient creation 

Often  transmission  lines  have  an  initial  voltage  and  current  that  is  interrupted  in  some  way, 
producing  transients.  For example, a charged TEM line at rest may have a switch  thrown at one 
end  that  suddenly  connects  it  to  a  load,  or  disconnects  it;  such  a  switch  could  be  located  in  the 
middle  of  a  line  too,  either  in  series  or  parallel.    The  solution  method  has  two  main  steps:  1) 
determine  v+(t,z)  and  v-(t,z)  at  t  =  0- before  the  change  occurs,  and  2)  solve  for  the  subsequent 
behavior of the forward and backward moving waves for the given network configuration.

Figure 8.1.7  Transients induced by momentarily open-circuited active TEM line. 
 

The  simple  example  of  Figure  8.1.7  illustrates  the  method.    Assume  an  air-filled  2-meter 
long  100-ohm TEM  line  is  feeding  a  200-ohm  load R with  I  =  50 milliamperes, when  suddenly 
at t = 0 the line is open-circuited at z = 1 meters for 10-9 seconds, after which it returns to normal.  
What are the voltage and current on the line as a result of this temporary event? 

- 239 -


Using the method suggested above, we first solve for the forward and backward waves prior 
to  t  =  0;  the  current  i(t<0,  z)  is  given  as  I  =  50  milliamperes,  and  the  voltage  v(t<0,  z)  =  IR  is 
0.05  ×  200  ohms  =  10  volts.    Note  that  in  steady  state  Zo  does  not  affect  v(t<0,  z).  We  know 
from (8.1.4) and (8.1.5) that:

(8.1.23) 

These two voltages are shown in Figure 8.1.7(b), 7.5 volts for the forward wave and 2.5 volts for 
the reflected wave; this is consistent with the given 50-ma current. 

When  the  switch  opens  at  t  =  0  for  10-9  seconds,  it  momentarily  interrupts  both  v+  and  v-, 
which  see  an  open  circuit  at  the  switch  and  Γ =  +1.  Therefore  in  (c) we  see  7.5  volts  reflected 
back to the left from the switch, and 2.5 volts reflected back toward the right.  At distances closer 
to  the switch  than ct [m] we  therefore see 15 volts to the left and 5 volts to the right; this zone is 
propagating  outward  at  velocity  c.    When  the  switch  closes  again,  these  mid-line  reflections 
cease and the voltages and currents return to normal as the two transient pulses of 15 and 5 volts 
continue  to  propagate  toward  the  two  ends  of  the  line,  as  shown  in  (d),  where  they  might  be 
reflected further. 

The  currents  associated  with  Figure  8.1.7(d)  can  easily  be  surmised  using  (8.1.21).    The 
effects of the switch are only felt for that brief 10-9-second interval, and otherwise the current on 
the  line  is  the  original  50  ma.    In  the  brief  interval  when  the  switch  was  open  the  current  was 
forced  to  zero,  and  so  zero-current  pulses  of  duration  10-9  seconds  propagate  away  from  the 
switch in both directions. 

Example 8.1D 
A  100-ohm  air-filled  TEM  line  of  length  D  is  feeding  1  ampere  to  a  50-ohm  load  when  it  is 
momentarily  short-circuited  in  its middle  for a  time T < D/2c.   What are v+(z  - ct) and v-(z + ct) 
prior to the short circuit, and during it? 

Solution:	 For  t  <  0,  Γ =  v-(D  -  ct)/v+(D  +  ct)  =  (Zn  -  1)/(Zn  +  1)  =  -0.5/1.5  =  -1/3  where  Zn  = 
50/100.  Since the line voltage v(z,t) equals the current i times the load resistance (v = 
50  volts),  it  follows  that  v+  +  v- =  2v+/3  =  50,  and  therefore  v+  =  v+(z  -  ct)  = 
75 volts, and v-(z + ct) = -25.  During  the short circuit the voltage within a distance d 
= ct of the short is altered.  On the source side the short circuit reflects v- = -v+ = -75, 

- 240 -


so  the  total  voltage  (v+  +  v-)  within  ct  meters  of  the  short  circuit  is  zero,  and  on  the 
load side v+ = -v- = 25 is reflected, so the total voltage is again zero.  The currents left 
and 
right  of 
the 
short  are  different,  however,  because 
the  original 
v+  ≠  v-,  and  i+  =  v+/Zo.  Therefore,  on  the  source  side  near  the  short  circuit, 
i = (v+ - Γv+)/Zo = 2v+/Zo = 2×75/50 = 3 [A].  On the load side near the short circuit, I 
= -2×25/50 = -1 [A].

Limits posed by devices and wires 

8.2.1 

Introduction to device models 

Most  devices  combine  conducting  elements  with  semiconductors,  insulators,  and  air  in  a 
complex  structure  that  stores,  switches,  or  transforms  energy  at  rates  limited  by  characteristic 
time constants governed by Maxwell’s equations and kinematics.   For example,  in vacuum  tubes 
electrons  are boiled  into vacuum  by  a  hot  negatively  charged  cathode with  small  fractions of  an 
electron volt of energy43.  Such  tubes switch state only so  fast as  the  free electrons can cross  the 
vacuum  toward  the  positively  charged  anode,  and  only  as  fast  as  permitted  by  the  RL  or  RC 
circuit  time constants  that control  the voltages accelerating or  retarding  the  electrons.   The  same 
physical limits also apply to most semiconductor devices, as suggested in Section 8.2.4, although 
sometimes  quantum  effects  introduce  non-classical  behavior,  as  illustrated  in  Section  12.3.1  for 
laser devices. 

Design  of  vacuum  tubes  for  use  above  ~100 MHz  was  difficult  because  high  voltages  and 
very  small  dimensions  were  required  to  shorten  the  electron  transit  time  to  fractions  of  a  radio 
frequency  (RF)  cycle.  The  wires  connecting  the  cathode,  anode,  and  any  grids  to  external 
circuits  also  contributed  inductance  that  limited  speed.   Trade-offs were  required.  For  example, 
as  the  cathode-anode  gap  was  diminished  to  shorten  electron  transit  times,  the  capacitance  C 
between  the  cathode  and  anode  increased  together  with  delays  associated  with  their  RC  time 
constant  τRC.  Exactly  the  same physical  issues of gap  length,  capacitance,  and τRC  arise  in most 
semiconductor devices.  The kinematics of electrons in vacuum was discussed in Sections 5.1.2– 
3, and the behavior of simple RL and RC circuits was discussed in Section 3.5.1. 

8.2.2 

Semiconductor device models 

One  simple  example  illustrates  typical  sources  of  lag  in  semiconductor  devices.    Both  pnp  and 
npn  transistors  are  composed of p-n  junctions  that contribute device-related delay.    Field-effect 
 
transistors  exhibit  related  lags.    Figures  8.2.1(a)  and  (b)  present  a  DC  p-n  junction  i-v 
characteristic and a circuit model that exhibits approximately correct delay characteristics for the 
case where low-loss metal wires are used for interconnecting devices. 

43 A thermal energy Eo of one electron volt (≅ 1.6×10-19 [J]) corresponds to a temperature T of ~11,600K, where Eo = 
kT  and  k  is  Boltzmann’s  constant:  k  ≅  1.38×10-23  [J/oK].    Thus  a  red-hot  cathode  at  ~1000K  would  boil  off  free 
electrons with thermal energies of ~0.1 e.v.

τ ≅ RbC 

When  the  ideal  diode  is  forward  biased  the  forward-bias  resistance Rf  determines  the  slope 
of  the  i-v  characteristic.  When  it  is  back-biased  beyond  ~Vb  the  ideal  diode  becomes  an  open 
circuit  so  the  junction  capacitance  C  becomes  important  and  the  back-bias  resistance  Rf  +  Rb  ≅ 
Rb determines the slope.  C arises because of the charge-free depletion region that exists in back-
biased  diodes,  an  explanation  of  which  is  given  in  Section  8.2.4.    C  decreases  as  the  back-bias 
voltage  increases because  the gap width d  increases and C ≅ εA/d  (3.1.10).  The bias voltage Vb 
in  the  equivalent  circuit  is  related  to  the  band  gap  between  the  valence  and  conduction  bands  in 
the  semiconductor,  and  is  ~1  volt  for  silicon  (see  Section  8.2.4  for  more  discussion).    The 
inductance  L  arises  primarily  from  wires  leading  externally,  and  is  discussed  further  in  Section 
8.2.3 for printed circuits, and estimated in Section 3.3.2 for isolated wires (3.3.17). 

Figure 8.2.1(c) represents a typical test voltage across a p-n junction applied as suggested in 
Figure  8.2.1(a).  It  begins  at  that  bias  voltage  v(t)  =  Vb  (~1  volt  in  silicon),  for  which  the 
equivalent  circuit  in Figure  8.2.1(b)  conducts  no  current  and  the  capacitor  is  discharged.   At  t = 
0+,  v(t)→Vo  and  the  current  i(t)  increases  toward  (Vo  -  Vb)/Rf  with  zero  incremental  resistance 
offered  by  the  diode  and  voltage  source,  so  the  time  constant  τ  is  L/Rf  seconds  (3.5.10),  as 
illustrated  in  Figure  8.2.1(d).    The  capacitor  remains  uncharged.    Section  3.5.1  discusses  time 
constants  for  simple  circuits.    As  a  result  of  diversion  of  energy  into  the  inductor,  the  current  i 
does  not  reach  levels  sufficient  to  trigger  the  next  circuit  element  until  t  ≅ δ1,  which  is  the  lag 
time. 

This  time  constant  δ1  can  be  easily  estimated.    For  example,  a  p-n  junction  might  be 
attached  to  wires  of  length  D  =  0.001  [m]  and  radius  ro  =  10-6  [m],  and  have  a  forward-biased 
resistance Rf of ~1 ohm.  In this case (3.3.17) yields the wire inductance: 

- 242 -


L ≅ μ D 16 π ) ln ( D r o ) ≅ 1.7 ×10 −10  [Henries ] 
( o 

(8.2.1)

Thus  δ1  ≅ τ =  L/R  =  1.7×10-10  seconds,  so  the  diode  might  handle  a  maximum  frequency  of 
~R/2πL  Hz,  or  ~1  GHz.    More  conservatively  the  diode  might  be  used  at  clock  frequencies 
below  ~0.2  GHz.  Modern  computers  employ  shorter  wires  and  smaller  Rf  in  order  to  work 
faster.    The  circuit  model  in  Figure  8.2.1(b)  does  not  include  the  capacitance  between  the  wire 
and the substrate because it is negligibly small here relative to the effects of L. 

When the test voltage v(t) then goes negative, the ideal diode in Figure 8.2.1(b) continues to 
conduct  until  the  current  through  the  inductor  decays  to  zero  with  the  same  L/Rf  time  constant. 
The  current  then  begins  charging  C  (as  the  depletion  layer  is  cleared  of  charge)  with  a  time 
constant  ~RbC  that  delays  the  current  response  for  a  total  of  ~δ2  seconds.  Note  that  for 
illustrative  purposes  the  current  scale  for  negative  i(t)  in  (d)  has  been  expanded  by  a  very  large 
factor (Rb/Rf) relative to the scale for positive i(t). 

When  the  test  voltage  then  returns  to  Vo  from  its  strong  negative  value,  it  must  first 
discharge  C  (re-populate  the  depletion  layer  with  charge)  before  the  ideal  diode  in  Figure 
8.2.1(c)  closes,  introducing  a  time  constant  of  ~RfC  that  we  can  estimate.    If  the  capacitance  C 
corresponds  to  a  depletion  layer  of  thickness  d  ≅ 10-7,  area A  ≅ 10-11  [m2],  and  permittivity  ε ≅ 
~10εo,  then  (3.1.10) yields C =  εA/d ≅ 10×8.8×10-12×10-11/10-7  ≅ 9×10-15  [F].  This yields RfC ≅ 
10-14  [s] << L/Rf,  so L/Rf would dominate  the  entire  transition,  resulting  in  a  total  lag of δ3  ≅ δ1 
seconds.  In  reality  i(t)  in  this  RLC  circuit  would  ring  at  ω ≅ (LC)-0.5  radians  per  second  as  i(t) 
and the ringing decay toward the asymptote i ≅ (Vo - Vb)/Rf. 

In  most  bi-polar  transistor  circuits  using  metal  wires  it  is  L/Rf  that  controls  the  maximum 
clock speed for the system, which is limited by the slowest junction and the most inductive wires 
in  the  entire  integrated  circuit.    In  MOS  integrated  circuits,  however,  the  resistivity  of  the 
polysilicon or diffusion layers used for conductors is sufficiently high that the wire inductance is 
often  no  longer  controlling,  as  discussed  in  Section  8.3.1.    Wire  inductance  is  most  easily 
reduced  by  using  shorter wider wires, which  also  reduces wire  resistance.    Longer  paths  can  be 
accommodated by using matched TEM lines, as discussed in Section 8.1. 

8.2.3  Quasistatic wire models 

The  lag  time  for  the  p-n  junction  of  Figure  8.2.1 was  dominated  by  L/Rf, where  L  originated  in 
the wires connected to the junction.  The effects of depletion layer capacitance C were negligible 
in comparison for the assumed device parameters.  In this section we examine the effects of wire 
capacitance and cross-section in limiting clock or signal frequencies.   

In  most  integrated  circuits  the  wires  are  planar  and  deposited  on  top  of  an  insulating  layer 
located over a conducting ground plane, as suggested in Figure 8.2.2.

These  values  combine  with  nominal  one-ohm  forward-bias  resistances  of  p-n  junctions  to  yield 
the time constants L/R = 3.6×10-8 seconds, and RC = 2.4×10-12 seconds.  Again the limit is posed 
by inductance.  Such printed circuit boards would be limited to frequencies f ≤ ~1/2πτ ≅ 4 MHz. 

The  numbers  cited  here  are  not  nearly  so  important  as  the  notion  that  interconnections  can 
strongly  limit frequencies of operation and circuit utility.   The quasistatic analysis above  is valid 
because  the  physical  dimensions  here  are  much  smaller  than  the  shortest  wavelength  (at  f  =  4 
MHz): λ = c/f ≅ 700 meters in air or ~230 meters in a dielectric with ε = 9εo. 

We  have  previously  ignored  wire  resistance  in  comparison  to  the  nominal  one-ohm 
resistance  of  forward-biased  p-n  junctions.    If  the  printed  wires  above  are  d  =10  microns  thick

Since  some  semiconductor  devices  have  forward  resistances  much  less  than  this,  wires  are 
sometimes  made  thicker  or  wider  to  compensate.    Wider  printed  wires  also  have  lower 
inductance  [see  (8.2.6)].   Width and  thickness are particularly  important for power supply wires, 
which often carry large currents. 

If  (8.2.7)  is  modified  to  represent  wires  on  integrated  circuits  where  the  dimensions  in 
microns  are  length  D  =  100,  thickness  d  =  0.1,  and  width  W  =  1,  then  R  =  20  ohms  and  far 
exceeds typical forward p-n junction resistances.  Limiting D to 20 microns while increasing d to 
0.4 and W to 2 microns would lower R to 0.5 ohms.  The resistivities of polysilicon and diffusion 
layers  often  used  for  conductors  can  be  1000  times  larger,  posing  even  greater  challenges. 
Clearly  wire  resistance  is  another  major  constraint  for  IC  circuit  design  as  higher  operating 
frequencies are sought. 

Example 8.2A 
A  certain  integrated  circuit  device  having  forward  resistance  Rf  =  0.1  ohms  is  fed  by  a 
polysilicon  conductor  that  is  0.2  microns  wide  and  thick,  2  microns  long,  and  supported 
0.1  micron  above  the  ground  plane  by  a  dielectric  having  ε  =  10εo.  The  conductivity  of  the 
polysilicon wire is ~5×104 S m-1.  What limits the switching time constant τ of this device? 

Solution:  	 R,  L,  and  C  for  the  conductor  can  be  found  from  (8.2.7),  (8.2.6),  and  (8.2.5), 
  R  =  D/dWσ  =  2×10-6/[(0.2×10-7)25×104]  =  1000,  L  ≅ μdD/W  =

1.26×10-15  [s],  and  (LC)0.5  =  2.11×10-14  [seconds/radian],  so  RC  limits  the  switching 
time.  If metal substituted for polysilicon, then LC would pose the limit here.

Semiconductors and idealized p-n junctions 

Among  the  most  commonly  used  semiconductors  are  silicon  (Si),  germanium  (Ge),  gallium 
arsenide (GAs), and indium phosphide (InP).  Semiconductors at low temperatures are insulators 
since all electrons are trapped in the immediate vicinity of their host atoms.  The periodic atomic 
spacing  of  crystalline  semiconductors  permits  electrons  of  sufficient  energy  to  propagate  freely 
without  scattering,  however.  Diodes  and  transistors  therefore  exhibit  conductivities  that  depend 
on  the  applied  voltages  and  resulting  electron  energy  distributions.   The  response  times  of  these 
devices  are  determined  by  electron  kinematics  and  the  response  times  of  the  circuits  and 
structures determining voltages and field strengths within the device. 

The  quantum  mechanical  explanation  of  such  electron  movement  invokes  the  wave  nature 
of electrons, which is governed by the Schroedinger wave equation (not explained here, although 
it  is similar  to  the electromagnetic wave equation).   The consequence  is  that semiconductors can 
be characterized by an energy diagram that shows possible electron energy states as a function of 
position  in  the  z  direction,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.2.3(a).    At  low  temperatures  all  electrons 
occupy  energy  states  in  the  lower  valence  band,  corresponding  to  bound  orbits  around  atoms. 
However  a  second  conduction  band  of  possible  energy  states  occupied  by  freely  moving 
electrons  exists  at  higher  energies  separated  from  the  valence  band  by  an  energy  gap  Eg  that

varies with material,  but  is  ~1  e.v.  for  silicon.    For  example,  a  photon with  energy  hf  = Ep  > Eg 
can  excite  a  bound  electron  in  the  valence  band  to  a  higher  energy  state  in  the  conduction  band 
where  that  electron  can  move  freely  and  conduct  electricity.    In  fact  this  photo-excitation 
mechanism is often used in semiconductor photo detectors to measure the intensity of light.

The probability that an unbound electron in thermal equilibrium at temperature T has energy 
E is governed by the Boltzmann distribution P{E} = e-E/kT/kT, where the Boltzmann constant k = 
1.38×10-23  and  one  electron  volt  is  1.6×10-19  [J].    Therefore  thermal  excitation  will  randomly 
place  a  few  free  electrons  in  the  conduction  band  since  P{E>Eg}  >  0.  However  this  provides 
only extremely limited conductivity because a gap of ~1 e.v. corresponds to a temperature of E/k 
≅ 11,600K, much greater than room temperature.44 

To boost the conductivity of semiconductors a small fraction of doping atoms are added that 
either  easily  release  one  electron  (called  donor  atoms),  or  that  easily  capture  an  extra  electron 
(acceptor  atoms).  These  atoms  assume  energy  levels  that  are  just  below  the  conduction  band 
 
edge (donor atoms) or just above the valence band edge (acceptor atoms), as illustrated in Figure 
8.2.3(b)  and  (c),  respectively.  These  energy  gaps  are  quite  small  so  a  significant  fraction  of  the 
donor and acceptor atoms are typically ionized at room temperature. 

The  probability  that  an  electron  has  sufficient  energy  to  leap  a  gap  Ea  is  the  integral  of  the 
Boltzmann probability distribution from Ea to E→∞, and Ea is sufficiently small that this integral 
can  approach  unity  for  some  dopant  atoms.    The  base  energy  for  the  Boltzmann  distribution  is 

44 The Fermi level of an undoped semiconductor is midway between the valence and conduction bands, so ~one-half 
electron volt is actually sufficient to produce excitation, although far more electrons exist in the valence band itself.

the Fermi level; electrons fill the available energy levels starting with the lowest and ending with 
the highest being  (on  average)  at  the Fermi  level.   The Fermi  level usually  lies very  close  to  the 
energy  level  associated  with  the  donor  or  acceptor  atoms,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  8.2.3(b–f). 
Since holes are positively charged,  their exponential Boltzmann distribution appears  inverted on 
the energy diagram, as illustrated in (c). 

For  each  ionized  donor  atom  there  is  an  electron  in  the  conduction  band  contributing  to 
conductivity.    For  each  negatively  ionized  acceptor  atom  there  is  a  vacated  positively  charged 
“hole” left behind.  An adjacent electron can easily jump to this hole, effectively moving the hole 
location  to  the  space  vacated  by  the  jumping  electron;  in  this  fashion  holes  can migrate  rapidly 
and  provide  nearly  the  same  conductivity  as  electrons  in  the  conduction  band.    Semiconductors 
doped  with  donor  atoms  so  that  free  electrons  dominate  the  conductivity  are  n-type 
semiconductors  (negative  carriers  dominate),  while  holes  dominate  the  conductivity  of  p-type 
semiconductors  doped  with  acceptors  (positive  carriers  dominate).    Some  semiconductors  are 
doped  to  produce  both  types  of  carriers.  The  conductivity  of  homogeneous  semiconductors  is 
proportional  to  the  number  of  charge  carriers,  which  is  controlled  primarily  by  doping  density 
and temperature. 

If  a  p-n  junction  is  short-circuited,  the  Fermi  level  is  the  same  throughout  as  shown  in 
Figure  8.2.3(d).  Therefore  the  tails  of  the Boltzmann  distributions  on  both  sides  of  the  junction 
are based at the same energy, so there is no net flow of current through the circuit. 

When  the  junction  is  back-biased  by  Vo  volts  as  illustrated  in  (e),  the  Fermi  level  is 
depressed  correspondingly.  The  dominant  current  comes  from  the  tail  of  the  Boltzmann 
distribution of electrons in the conduction band of  the p-type semiconductor;  these few electrons 
will  be  pulled  to  the  positive  terminal  and  are  indicated  by  the  small  white  arrow.    Some  holes 
thermally  created  in  the  n-type  valence  band may  also  contribute  slightly.    Because  the  carriers 
come  from  the  high  tail  of  the  Boltzmann  thermal  distribution,  the  reverse  current  in  a  p-n 
junction is strongly dependent upon temperature and can be used as a thermometer; it is not very 
dependent  upon  voltage  once  the  voltage  is  sufficiently  negative.   When  a  p-n  junction  is  back-
biased,  the  electric  field  pulls  back  most  low-energy  free  electrons  into  the  n-type 
semiconductor,  and  pulls  the  holes  into  the  p-type  semiconductor,  leaving  a  carrier-free  layer, 
called a charge-depletion region,  that acts like a capacitor.   Larger values of Vo yield  larger gaps 
and smaller capacitance. 

When  the  junction  is  forward-biased  by  Vo  volts,  as  illustrated  in  (f),  the  charge-free  layer 
disappears  and  the  current  flow  is  dominated  by  the  much  greater  fraction  of  electrons  excited 
into  the  conduction  band  in  the  n-type  semiconductor  because  almost  all  of  them will  be  pulled 
by  the  applied  electric  field  across  the  junction  before  recombining  with  a  positive  ion.    This 
flow  of  electrons  (opposite  to  current  flow)  is  indicated  by  the  larger  white  arrow,  and  is 
proportional  to  that  fraction  of P{E}  that  lies  beyond  the  small  energy  gap  separating  the Fermi 
level  and  the  lower  edge  of  the  conduction  band.   Holes  in  the  valence  band  can  also  contribute 
significantly  to  this  current.   The  integral over  energy of  the  exponential probability distribution 
P{E}  above  threshold  Eg  -  v  is  another  exponential  for  0  <  v  <  Eg, which  is  proportional  to  the 
population  of  conducting  electrons,  and  which  approximates  the  i(v)  relation  for  a  p-n  junction 
illustrated in Figure 8.2.1(a) for v > 0. 

- 247 -


Transistors  are  semiconductor  devices  configured  so  that  the  number  of  carriers  (electrons 
plus holes) available in a junction to support conductivity is controlled 1) by the number injected 
into the junction by a p-n interface biased so as to inject the desired number (e.g., as is done in p-
n-p  or  n-p-n  transistors),  or  2)  by  the  carriers  present  that  have  not  been  pulled  to  one  side  or 
trapped  by  electric  fields  (e.g.,  field-effect  transistors). 
In  general,  small  bias  currents  and 
voltages  can  thereby  control  the  current  flowing  across  much  larger  voltage  gaps  with  power 
amplification  factors  of  100  or more.    Although  the  range  of  device  designs  is  very  large, most 
can  be  understood  semi-classically  as  suggested  above,  without  the  full  quantum  mechanical 
descriptions needed for precise characterization. 

The  response  time  of  p-n  junctions  and  transistors  is  usually  determined  by  either  the  RC, 
RL, or LC  time constants  that  limit  the  rise and  fall  times of voltages and currents applied  to  the 
device  terminals, or by  the  field  relaxation  time ε/σ  (4.3.3) of  the semiconductor material within 
the  device  itself.  In  extremely  fast  devices  the  response  time  sometimes  is  τ ≅ D/v, where D  is 
the  junction  dimension  [m]  of  interest,  and  v  is  the  velocity  of  light  (v  =  [με]-0.5)  or  of  the 
transiting electrons ( v = ∫ a dt , f = ma = eE). 

Although  these  physical  models  for  semiconductor  junctions  are  relatively  primitive,  they 
do approximately explain most phenomena. 

Example 8.2B 
What  are  the  approximate  temperature  dependences  of  the  currents  flowing  in  forward-  and 
reverse-biased p-n junctions? 

Solution:	

If  the  bias  voltage  exceeds  the  gap  voltage,  and  kT  is  large  compared  to  the  energy 
gap  between  the  donor  level  and  the  conduction  band,  then  essentially  all  donors  are 
ionized  and  further  temperature  changes  have  little  effect  on  forward  biased  p-n 
junctions;  see  Figure  8.2.3(f).  The  carrier  concentration  in  reverse-biased  diodes  is

8.3  Distortions due to loss and dispersion 

8.3.1  Lossy transmission lines 

In most electronic systems transmission line loss is a concern because business strategy generally 
dictates  reducing wire  diameters  and  costs  until  such  issues  arise.    For  example,  the  polysilicon 
often used for conductors in integrated silicon devices has noticeable resistance. 

The TEM circuit model of Figure 8.3.1 incorporates two types of loss.  The series resistance 
R per meter arises from the finite conductivity of the wires, while the parallel conductance G per 
meter  arises  from  leakage  currents  flowing  between  the  wires  through  the  medium  separating 
them.

(8.3.1)

(8.3.2) 

If  the wires  are  resistive,  then  current  flowing  through  them  introduces  longitudinal  electric 
fields  Ez,  violating  the  TEM  assumption:  Ez  =  Hz  =  0.  Since  rigorous  solution  of  Maxwell’s 
equations for the non-TEM case is challenging, the telegraphers’ equations are often used instead 
if  the  loss  is  modest.    The  same  problem  does  not  arise  with  G  because  it  does  not  violate  the 
TEM  assumption,  as  shown  in  Section  7.1.3.    Since  propagation  in  such  lossy  TEM  lines  is 
frequency  dependent,  the  telegraphers’  equations  (8.3.1–2)  and  their  solutions  are  generally 
expressed using complex notation45:

Differentiating (8.3.3) with respect to z, and substituting (8.3.4) for dI(z)/dz yields  the wave 
equation for  lossy TEM  lines, where  the sign of k2  is chosen so  that k  is real, consistent with  the

(8.3.9)

Thus  two  new  properties  emerge when  TEM  lines  are  dissipative:  1)  because  k  is  complex 
and a non-linear function of frequency, waves are attenuated and dispersed as they propagate in a 
frequency-dependent  manner,  and  2)  Zo  is  complex  and  frequency  dependent.  Both  k'  and  k" 
(8.3.6)  are  functions  of  frequency,  so  signals  propagating  on  lossy  lines  change  shape,  partly 
because  different  frequency  components  propagate  and  decay  differently.    The  resulting 
attenuation  and  dispersion  are  discussed  in  Sections  8.3.1  and  8.3.2,  respectively.    Reflections 
are  affected  at  junctions  by  losses,  and  also  are  attenuated  with  distance  so  the  impedance  of  a 
lossy  line  Z(z)  → Zo  regardless  of  load  as  V-(z)  becomes  negligible.    Reflections  by  junctions 
involving  lossy  lines  are  simply  analyzed  by  replacing  Zo  by  a  complex  impedance  Zo  in  the 
expressions developed in Section 7.2 for lossless lines. 

Waves propagating only in the +z direction obey (8.3.7), which becomes:

(8.3.10)

One  combination  of  R,  L,  C,  and  G  is  particularly  interesting  because  it  results  in  zero 
dispersion  and  a  frequency-independent  decay  that  does  not  distort  waveforms.    We  may 
discover this combination by evaluating k using (8.3.6):

It  follows  from  (8.3.11)  that  if R/L = G/C,  then  the  phase  velocity  (vp  = ω/k' =  [LC]-0.5)  and  the 
decay rate (k" = R[C/L]0.5) are both frequency independent:

(distortionless line) 

(8.3.12) 

The  ability  to  avoid  signal  distortion  due  to  frequency-dependent  absorption  was  first 
exploited  by  telephone  companies  who  added  small  inductors  periodically  in  series  with  their 
longer  phone  lines  in  order  to  reduce  R/L  so  that  it  balanced  G/C;  the  result  was  called  a 

- 250 -


distortionless  line,  and  the  coils  are  called  Pupin  coils  after  their  inventor46.  The  consequences 
of dispersion are explored in Section 8.3.2. 

Another  limit  is  sometimes  of  interest  when  the  effects  of  R  dominate  those  of  ωL.  This 
occurs,  for  example,  in  resistive  polysilicon  or  diffusion  lines  in  integrated  circuits,  which  may 
be approximately modeled by eliminating L and G from Figure 8.3.1.  Then k (8.3.11) becomes:

The  square  root  of  -j  was  chosen  to  correspond  to  a  decaying  wave  rather  than  to  exponential 
growth.  The phase and group velocities for this line are the same:

(8.3.15) 

Although  it  is  not  easy  to  relate  these  frequency-dependent  velocities  to  delays  in  digital 
circuits,  they demonstrate  that such delays exist and express  their dependence on R and C.   That 
is,  larger  line  time  constants RC  lower  pulse  velocities  and  increase  delays.    Such  lines  are  best 
used  when  they  are  short  compared  to  the  shortest  wavelength  of  interest,  D  <  λ =  vp/fmax  = 
2π(2/rcωmax)0.5.  In  polysilicon  lines  λmin  ≅  1  mm  for  ωmax  =  1010.  The  response  to  arbitrary 
waveform  excitation  can  be  computed  by:  1)  Fourier  transforming  the  signal,  2)  propagating 
each  frequency  component  as  dictated  by  (8.3.13),  and  then  3)  reconstructing  the  signal  at  the 
new  location  with  an  inverse  Fourier  transform.    Typical  values  for  R  and  C  in  metal, 
polysilicon,  and  diffusion  lines  are  presented  in  Table  8.3.1,  and  correspond  to  velocities  much 
less than c.  The costs of these three options for forming conductors are unequal and must also be 
considered when designing fast integrated circuits.

8.3.2  Dispersive transmission lines 

Different  frequency  components  propagate  at  different  velocities  on  dispersive  transmission 
lines. The nature and consequences of dispersion are discussed further in Section 9.5.2.  Consider 
first a square-wave computer clock pulse at F Hz propagating along a dispersive TEM  line.   The 
Fourier  transform of  this  signal has  its  fundamental  at F Hz, with odd harmonics  at 3F, 5F,  etc., 
each of which has its own phase velocity, as suggested in Figure 8.3.2.

Significant pulse distortion occurs  if a strong harmonic  is shifted as much as ~90o  relative  to  the 
fundamental.    To  determine  the  relative  phase  shift  between  fundamental  and  harmonic  we  can 
first multiply the difference in phase velocity at F and 3F, e.g., vpF - vp3F, by the propagation time 
T  of  interest.   This  yields  the  spatial  offset  between  these  two  harmonics, which we might  limit 
to λ/4 for 3F.  That is, we might expect significant distortion over a transmission line of length D 
= vpT meters if:   
(vpF − vp3F )T > ~ λ3F  4 = vp3F  (4 × 3F
)	

(8.3.17) 

 

There  is  a  similar  limit  to  the  propagation  distance  of  narrowband  pulse  signals  before 
waveform  distortion  becomes  unacceptable.    Digital  communications  systems  commonly  use 
narrowband  pulses  s(t)  for  both  wireless  and  cable  signaling.    For  example,  the  square  wave  in 
Figure  8.3.2  could  also  represent  the  amplitude  envelope  A(t)  =  Σi  ai  cosωit  of  an  underlying 
sinusoid cosωot, where ωo >> ωi>0 and together they occupy a narrow bandwidth.  That is:

(8.3.18)

Since each frequency ωo±ωi propagates at a slightly different phase velocity, a narrowband pulse 
will  also  distort  when  a  strong  harmonic  is  ~λ/4  out  of  phase  relative  to  the  original  wave 
envelope, which  is much  larger  than λ =  2πc/ωo  for  narrowband  signals.  Some  applications  are 
more  sensitive  to  dispersive  distortion  than  others;  for  example,  distorted  digital  signals  can  be 

- 252 -


generally be  regenerated distortion  free, while analog signals  require  inverse distortion, which  is 
often uneconomic. 

Distortion  of  narrowband  signals  is  usually  computed  in  terms  of  the  group  velocity  vg, 
which is the velocity of propagation for the waveform envelope and equals the velocity of energy 
or  information,  which  can  never  exceed  c,  the  velocity  of  light  in  vacuum.    The  sine  wave  that 
characterizes  the  average  frequency  of  a  narrowband  pulse  propagates  at  the  phase  velocity  vp, 
which  can  be  greater  or  less  than  c.  Narrowband  pulse  signals  (e.g.,  digitally  modulated 
sinusoids)  distort  when  the  accumulated  difference  Δ  in  the  envelope  propagation  distances 
between  the  high-  and  low-frequency  end  of  the  signal  spectrum  differs  by  more  than  a  small 
fraction  of  the  minimum  pulse  width  W[m]  (e.g.,  the  length  of  a  zero  or  one).    Since  the 
difference  in  group  velocity  across  the  bandwidth B[Hz]  is  (∂vg/∂f)B  [m/s],  and  the  pulse  travel 
time  is  D/vg,  where  D  is  propagation  distance,  it  follows  that  the  difference  in  envelope 
propagation distance across the band is: 
∂vg  BD  [
Δ = 
∂f  vg 

(8.3.19)

Since  the  minimum  pulse  width W  is  ~vg/B  [m],  the  requirement  that  D  << W  implies  that  the

Typical 50-ohm coaxial cables for home distribution of television and internet signals have series 
0.5)  ohms  m-1.  Assume  ε  =  4εo,  μ  =  μo.  How  far  can  signals  propagate 
resistance  R  ≅  0.02(fMHz
before attenuating 60 dB? 

Solution:  	 Since  conductivity  G  ≅  0,  (8.3.11)  says  k  =  ω[LC(1  -  jR/ωL)]0.5  =  k'  +  jk".    The 
imaginary part of k corresponds to exponential decay.  For R << ωL, k ≅ ω(LC)0.5(1 -
jR/ωL)0.5,  so  k"  =  -(ωRC)0.5.  To  find  C  we  note  the  phase  velocity  v  =  (μo4εo)-0.5  = 
(LC)-0.5  =  c/2  ≅  1.5×108  [m  s-1],  and  Zo  =  50  =  (L/C)0.5.   Therefore  C  =  2/cZo  = 
2/(3×108×50)  ≅  1.33×10-10  [F].
  Thus  at  100  MHz,  k"  =  -(ωRC)0.5  = 
-(2π108×0.2×1.33×10-10)0.5 ≅ -0.017.  Since power decays as e-2k"z, 60 dB corresponds 
to  e-2k"z  =  10-6,  so  z  =  -ln(10-6)/2k"  =  406 meters.   At  100 MHz  the  approximation R 
<<  ωL  is  quite  valid.  As  coaxial  cable  systems  boost  data  rates  and  their maximum 
frequency  above  100-200  MHz,  the  increased  attenuation  requires  amplifiers  at 
intervals so short as  to motivate switching  to optical  fibers  that can propagate signals 
hundred of kilometers without amplification.

Chapter 9:  Electromagnetic Waves 

9.1  Waves at planar boundaries at normal incidence 

9.1.1 

Introduction 

Chapter  9  treats  the  propagation  of  plane  waves  in  vacuum  and  simple  media,  at  planar 
boundaries, and in combinations confined between sets of planar boundaries, as in waveguides or 
cavity  resonators.   Chapter 10  then discusses how  such waves  can be generated  and  received by 
antennas and antenna arrays. 

More  specifically,  Section  9.1  explains  how  plane  waves  are  reflected  from  planar 
boundaries  at  normal  incidence,  and  Section  9.2  treats  reflection  and  refraction when  the waves 
are  incident  at  arbitrary  angles.    Section  9.3  then  explains  how  linear  combinations  of  such 
waves  can  satisfy  all  boundary  conditions  when  they  are  confined  within  parallel  plates  or 
rectangular  cylinders  acting  as  waveguides.    By  adding  planar  boundaries  at  the  ends  of  such 
waveguides,  waves  can  be  trapped  at  the  resonant  frequencies  of  the  resulting  cavity,  as 
explained  in  Section  9.4.  Sections  9.5  then  treat  waves  in  anisotropic,  dispersive,  and  ionized 
media, respectively. 

9.1.2 

Introduction to boundary value problems 

Section  2.2  showed  how  uniform  planes  waves  could  propagate  in  any  direction  with  any 
polarization,  and  could  be  superimposed  in  any  combination  to  yield  a  total  electromagnetic 
field.  The  general  electromagnetic  boundary  value  problem  treated  in  Sections  9.1–4  involves 
determining  exactly  which,  if  any,  combination  of  waves  matches  any  given  set  of  boundary 
conditions, which are the relations between the electric and magnetic fields adjacent to both sides 
of  each  boundary.  These  boundaries  can  generally  be  both  active  and  passive,  the  active 
boundaries  usually  being  sources.   Boundary  conditions  generally  constrain  E   and/or  H   for  all 
time on the boundary of the two- or three-dimensional region of interest. 

The  uniqueness  theorem  presented  in  Section  2.8  states  that  only  one  solution  satisfies  all 
Maxwell’s equations if the boundary conditions are sufficient. Therefore we may solve boundary 
value  problems  simply  by  hypothesizing  the  correct  combination  of waves  and  testing  it  against 
Maxwell’s  equations.  That  is, we  leave  undetermined  the  numerical  constants  that  characterize 
the  chosen  combination  of  waves,  and  then  determine  which  values  of  those  constraints  satisfy 
Maxwell’s  equations.  This  strategy  eases  the  challenge  of  hypothesizing  the  final  answer 
directly.  Moreover,  symmetry  and  other  considerations  often  suggest  the  nature  of  the  wave 
combination required by the problem, thus reducing the numbers of unknown constants that must 
be determined. 

The four basic steps for solving boundary value problems are: 

1)  	 Determine the natural behavior of each homogeneous section of the system in isolation 
(absent its boundaries). 

- 255 -


2)  	 Express  this natural behavior  as  the  superposition of waves  characterized by unknown 
constants;  symmetry  and  other  considerations  can  minimize  the  number  of  waves 
required.  Here  our  basic  building  blocks  are  usually  uniform  plane  waves,  but  other 
more compact expansions are typically used if the symmetry of the problem permits, as 
illustrated  in  Section  4.5.2  for  cylindrical  and  spherical  geometries,  Section  7.2.2  for 
TEM transmission lines, and Section 9.3.1 for waveguide modes. 

3)  	 Write  equations  for  the  boundary  conditions  that  must  be  satisfied  by  these  sets  of 
superimposed waves, and then solve for the unknown constants. 

4)  	 Test  the  resulting  solution  against  any  of  Maxwell’s  equations  that  have  not  already 
been imposed. 

Variations  of  this  four-step  procedure  can  be  used  to  solve  almost  any  problem  by  replacing 
Maxwell’s equations with their approximate equivalent for the given problem domain. 

9.1.3  Reflection from perfect conductors 

One  of  the  simplest  examples  of  a  boundary  value  problem  is  that  of  a  uniform  plane  wave  in 
vacuum  normally  incident  upon  a  planar  perfect  conductor  at  z  ≥  0,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
9.1.1(a).  Step  1  of  the  general  boundary-problem  solution method  of  Section  9.1.2  is  simply  to 
note  that  electromagnetic  fields  in  the  medium  can  be  represented  by  superimposed  uniform 
plane waves.

For  this  incompletely  defined  example,  the  initial  part  of  Step  2  of  the  method  involves 
refinement  of  the  problem  definition  by  describing  more  explicitly  the  incident  wave,  for 
example:

where  the  wave  number  k  =  2π/λ  =  ω/c  =  ω(μoεo)0.5,  (2.3.24).    The  associated  magnetic  field 
(2.3.25) is:

(9.1.2) 

This  unambiguously  defines  the  source,  and  the  boundary  is  similarly  unambigous:  σ  =  ∞  and 
therefore  E 0   for z ≥ 0.  This more complete problem definition  is  sufficient  to yield a unique 
=
solution.  Often the first step in solving a problem is to ensure its definition is complete. 

Since  there  can  be  no  waves  inside  the  perfect  conductor,  and  since  the  source  field  alone 
does  not  satisfy  the  boundary  condition  E //  = 0   at  z  =  0,  one  or  more  additional  plane  waves 
must  be  superimposed  to  yield  a  valid  solution.    In  particular,  we  need  to  match  the  boundary 
condition  E //  = 0  at z = 0.  This can be done by adding a single uniform plane wave propagating 
in the -z direction with an electric field that cancels the incident electric field at z = 0 for all time 
t. 	 Thus we hypothesize that the total electric field is: 

) = xˆ ⎡Eo cos  (  t   kz  ) +  1 cos   t   kz  + φ )⎦

(9.1.3) 

where we have introduced the constants E1 and φ. 

In  Step  3  of  the method we must  solve  the  equation  (9.1.3)  that  characterizes  the  boundary 
value constraints:

∴ E1 = −Eo  ,  φ = 0 

The result (9.1.5) yields the final trial solution:

Note  that  the  sign  of  the  reflected  H   wave  is  reversed  from  that  of  the  reflected  E ,  consistent 
with  the  reversal  of  the  Poynting  vector  for  the  reflected  wave  alone.    We  have  used  the 
identities: 

cos α + cos β = 2 cos ⎡⎣( α + β )  2⎤⎦ cos ⎡⎣( α − β )  2 ⎤⎦	

cos α − cos β = − 2 sin ⎡⎣( α + β )  2⎤⎦ sin ⎣⎡( α − β )  2 ⎤⎦

Also note that

 is 90o out of phase with  E ( z, t )

 with respect to both time and space.

We  also  need  a  trial  solution  for  z  >  0.    Inside  the  conductor  E H=
conditions (2.6.17) require a surface current: 

= 0 ,  and  boundary 

⎣⎡ 
Js  nˆ  H   Am

⎤⎦ 

 

(9.1.10) 

The  fourth  and  final  step  of  this  problem-solving  method  is  to  test  the  full  trial  solution 
against  all  of Maxwell’s  equations.  We  know  that  our  trial  solution  satisfies  the wave  equation 
in  our  source-free  region  because  our  solution  is  the  superposition  of waves  that  do;  it  therefore 
also  satisfies Faraday’s  and Ampere’s  laws  in  a  source-free  region,  as well  as Gauss’s  laws.   At 
the  perfectly  conducting  boundary  we  require  E //  = 0  and  H⊥ = 0 ;  these  constraints  are  also 
satisfied  by  our  trial  solution,  and  therefore  the  problem  is  solved  for  the  vacuum.    Zero-value 
fields  inside  the  conductor  satisfy  all  Maxwell’s  equations,  and  the  surface  current  Js   (9.1.10) 
satisfies the final boundary condition. 

The nature of  this solution  is  interesting.   Note  that  the  total electric field  is zero not only at 
the  surface  of  the  conductor,  but  also  at  a  series  of  null  planes  parallel  to  the  conductor  and 
spaced at intervals Δ along the z axis such that kznulls = -nπ, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...  That is, the null 
spacing  Δ =  π/k  =  λ/2,  where  λ  is  the  wavelength.    On  the  other  hand,  the  magnetic  field  is 
maximum  at  those  planes  where  E  is  zero  (the  null  planes  of  E),  and  has  nulls  where  E  is 
maximum.    Since  the  time  average  power  flow  and  the  Poynting  vector  are  clearly  zero  at  each 
of  these planes,  there  is no net power  flow  to  the  right.   Except at  the  field nulls, however,  there 
is  reactive power,  as discussed  in Section 2.7.3.   Because no average power  is  flowing via  these 
waves  and  the  energy  and  waves  are  approximately  stationary  in  space,  the  solution  is  called  a 
standing  wave,  as  illustrated  in  Figures  7.2.3  for  VSWR  and  7.4.1  for  resonance  on  perfectly 
reflecting TEM transmission lines.   

9.1.4  Reflection from transmissive boundaries 

Often  more  than  one  wave  must  be  added  to  the  given  incident  wave  to  satisfy  all  boundary 
conditions.  For  example,  assume  the  same  uniform  plane wave  (9.1.1–2)  in  vacuum  is  incident 
upon  the  same  planar  interface,  where  a  medium  having  μ,ε ≠ μo,εo  for  z  ≥ 0  has  replaced  the 
conductor.  We  have  no  reason  to  suspect  that  the  fields  beyond  the  interface  are  zero,  so  we 
might  try a  trial solution with both a  reflected wave Er(z,t) and a  transmitted wave Et(z,t) having 
unknown amplitudes (Er and Et) and phases (φ and θ) for which we can solve:

Using  these  four  equations  to match  boundary  conditions  at  z  =  0  for  E //   and  H // ,  both  of 
which are continuous across an insulating boundary, and dividing by Eo, yields:

First we note that for these equations to be satisfied for all time t we must have φ = θ = 0, unless

reflections  and  the  transmitted  wave  equals  the  incident  wave.    We  then  have  an  impedance 
match.  These  values  for  Er/Eo  and  Et/Eo  can  be  substituted  into  (9.1.11–14)  to  yield  the  final

9.2  Waves incident on planar boundaries at angles 

9.2.1 

Introduction to waves propagating at angles 

To determine electromagnetic  fields we can generally solve a boundary value problem using  the 
method of Section 9.1.1,  the  first  step of which  involves characterization of  the basic quasistatic 
or  dynamic  fields  and  waves  that  could  potentially  exist  within  each  separate  region  of  the 
problem.   The  final solution  is a  linear combination of  these basic fields and waves  that matches 
all boundary conditions at the interfaces between the various regions. 

So  far  we  have  considered  only  waves  propagating  along  boundaries  or  normal  to  them. 
The  general  case  involves  waves  incident  upon  boundaries  at  arbitrary  angles,  so  we  seek  a 
compact  notation  characterizing  such  waves  that  simplifies  the  boundary  value  equations  and 
their  solutions.   Because wave  behavior  at  boundaries  often  becomes  frequency  dependent,  it  is 
convenient  to use  complex notation  as  introduced  in Section 2.3.2 and  reviewed  in Appendix B, 
which can explicitly  represent  the  frequency dependence of wave phenomena.   For example, we 
might  represent  the  electric  field  associated  with  a  uniform  plane  wave  propagating  in  the  +z 
jkz 
oE e− 
, where:

(9.2.1) 

(9.2.2) 

This  notation  is  simpler  than  the  time  domain  representation.    For  example,  if  this  wave 
were x-polarized, then the compact complex notation  xˆE x  would be replaced in the time domain 
by: 

t } = xˆR e {( R e [E  (z) 
E t ( ) = R e { xˆE (z)e 
]) ( cos ωt + j sin ωt )}

(9.2.3)

- 260 -


The more general time-domain expression including both x and y components would be twice as 
long.  Thus  complex  notation  adequately  characterizes  frequency-dependent  wave  propagation 
and is more compact. 

The  physical  significance  of  (9.2.1)  is  divided  into  two  parts:  E o   tells  us  the  polarization, 
amplitude, and absolute phase of  the wave at  the origin, and e-j2πz/λ ≡  ejφ(z)  tells us how  the phase 
φ of this wave varies with position.   In this case the phase decreases 2π radians as z increases by 
one  wavelength  λ.  The  physical  significance  of  a  phase  shift  φ  of  -2π  radians  for  z  =  λ  is  that 
observers located at z = λ experience a delay of 2π radians; for pure sinusoids a phase shift of 2π 
is of course not observable. 

Waves  propagating  in  arbitrary  directions  are  therefore  easily  represented  by  expressions 
similar  to  (9.2.1),  but  with  a  phase  φ  that  is  a  function  of  x,  y,  and  z.    For  example,  a  general 
plane wave would be: 

E ( ) = E e
z
o 

− jk  x − jk  y − jk z 
i 
z  = E e − jk  r

where  r = xˆx + yˆy + zˆz  and:

 z 

(9.2.4)

(9.2.5)

We call  k  the  propagation vector or wave number  k .  The wave numbers kx, ky, and kz have the 
dimensions  of  radians  per  meter  and  determine  how  rapidly  the  wave  phase  φ  varies  with 
position along  the x, y, and z axes,  respectively.   Positions having  the  same value  for  k r  have
•
the same phase and are  located on  the same phase  front.  A wave with a planar phase  fronts  is a 
plane wave, and if its amplitude is constant across any phase front, it is a uniform plane wave.

The  vector  k   points  in  the  direction  of  propagation  for  uniform  plane  waves.    The  geometry  is 
represented  in  Figure  9.2.1  for  a  uniform  plane wave  propagating  in  the  x-z  plane  at  an  angle  θ

k r•  must be constant everywhere in such a plane.

9.2.2  Waves at planar dielectric boundaries 

Waves  at  planar  dielectric  boundaries  are  solved  using  the  boundary-value-problem  method  of 
Section 9.1.4 applied to waves propagating at angles, as introduced in Section 9.2.1.   

Because  the  behavior  of  waves  at  an  interface  depends  upon  their  polarization  we  need  a 
coordinate system  for characterizing  it.   For  this purpose  the plane of  incidence  is defined as  the 
plane of projection of the incident wave propagation vector  k  upon the interface, as illustrated in 
Figure  9.2.2(a).    One  cartesian  axis  is  traditionally  defined  as  being  normal  to  this  plane  of 
incidence; in the figure it is the y axis.

Figure 9.2.2  Uniform plane wave incident upon a planar interface. 
 

We  know  from  Section  2.3.4  that  any  pair  of  orthogonally  polarized  uniform  plane  waves 
can  be  superimposed  to  achieve  any  arbitrary  wave  polarization.    For  example,  x-  and  y-
polarized waves can be superimposed.   It  is customary  to recognize  two simple  types of  incident 

- 263 -


electromagnetic  waves  that  can  be  superimposed  to  yield  any  incident  wave  polarization: 
transverse  electric  waves  (TE  waves)  are  linearly  polarized  transverse  to  the  plane  of  incidence 
(y-polarized  in  the  figure),  and  transverse  magnetic  waves  (TM  waves)  have  the  orthogonal 
linear  polarization  so  that  the magnetic  field  is  purely  transverse  (again  if  y-polarized).   TE  and 
TM waves are typically transmitted and reflected with different amplitudes.   

Consider  first  a  TE  wave  incident  upon  the  planar  interface  of  Figure  9.2.2(b)  at  the 
incidence angle θi.  The corresponding  H  lies in the x-z plane and is orthogonal to  E .  H  points 
propagating  toward  the  interface, 
downward  in  the  figure,  corresponding  to  power  S E × H
= 
where  S   is  the  Poynting  vector  for  the  incident  wave.    The  wavelength  of  the  wave  above  the 
interface  is  λo  =  1/(f  με )   in  the  medium  characterized  by  permittivity  ε  and  permeability  μ. 
The medium  into which  the wave  is partially  transmitted  is  characterized by  εt  and μt,  and  there 
the wave has wavelength λt =  1/(f  μ ε  )  and  the same  frequency  f.   This  incident TE wave can

where  the characteristic  impedance of  the  incident medium  is η =  μ/ε  , and  H   is orthogonal  to 
E .  

The transmitted wave would generally be similar, but with a different ηt, θt, Et, and  k t .  We 
might  expect  a  reflected  wave  as  well.    The  boundary-value-problem  method  of  Section  9.1.2 
requires  expressions  for  all  waves  that  might  be  present  in  both  regions  of  this  problem.    In 
addition  to  the  incident  wave  we  therefore  might  add  general  expressions  for  reflected  and 
transmitted  waves  having  the  same  TE  polarization.    If  still  other  waves  were  needed  then  no 
solution satisfying all Maxwell’s equations would emerge until they were added too; we shall see 
no others are needed here.  These general reflected and transmitted waves are:

where  we  have  defined  the  normalized  angular  impedance  for  TE  waves  as  ηn'  ≡ 
ηtcosθi/(ηcosθt).  The  complex  angular  reflection  and  transmission  coefficients  Γ and  T  for  TE 
waves  approach  those  given  by  (9.1.19)  and  (9.1.20)  for  normal  incidence  in  the  limit  θi  → 0. 
The  limit  of  grazing  incidence  is  not  so  simple,  and  even  the  form  of  the  transmitted  wave  can 
change  markedly  if  it  becomes  evanescent,  as  discussed  in  the  next  section.    The  results  for 
( ) 2  for  a  typical
incident  TM  waves  are  postponed  to  Section  9.2.6.  Figure  9.2.6(a)  plots

dielectric  interface.    It  is  sometimes  useful  to  note  that  (9.2.28)  and  (9.2.29)  also  apply  to 
equivalent  TEM  lines  for  which  the  characteristic  impedances  of  the  input  and  output  lines  are 
ηi/cosθi  and  ηt/cosθt,  respectively.  When  TM waves  are  incident,  the  corresponding  equivalent 
impedances are ηicosθi and ηtcosθt, respectively. 

Example 9.2B 
What  fraction of  the normally  incident power  (θi = 0)  is  reflected by a  single glass camera  lense 
having ε = 2.25εo?  If θi = 30o, what is θt in the glass? 

Solution:	 At  each  interface  between  air  and  glass,  (9.2.28)  yields  for  θi  =  0:  ΓL  = 
(ηn' - 1)/(ηn' + 1), where ηn' = (ηglasscosθi)/(ηaircosθt) = (εi/εg)0.5 = 1/1.5.  Thus ΓL = (1 
- 1.5)/(1  +  1.5)  =  -0.2,  and  |Γ|2  =  0.04,  so  ~4  percent  of  the  power  is  reflected  from 
each of  the  two curved surfaces  for each  independent  lense, or ~8 percent  total;  these 
reflections  are  incoherent  so  their  reflected  powers  add.    Modern  lenses  have  many 
elements  with  different  permittivities,  but  coatings  on  them  reduce  these  reflections, 
as  discussed  in  Section  7.3.2  for  quarter-wave  transformers.    Snell’s  law  (9.2.26) 
yields θt = sin-1[(εi/εt)0.5 sinθi] = sin-1[(1/1.5)(0.5)] = 19.5°. 

9.2.3  Evanescent waves 

Figure 9.2.3 suggests why a special form of electromagnetic wave is sometimes required in order 
to  satisfy  boundary  conditions.    Figure  9.2.3(a)  illustrates  how  the  required  equality  of  the  z 
components  of  the  incident,  reflected,  and  transmitted  wave  propagation  vectors  k   controls  the 
angles  of  reflection  and  transmission,  θr  and  θt.  The  radii  of  the  two  semi-circles  correspond  to 
the magnitudes of  ki  and  k t . 

Figure  9.2.3(b)  shows  that  a  wave  incident  at  a  certain  critical  angle  θc  will  produce  a

transmitted  wave  propagating  parallel  to  the  interface,  provided

Figures 9.2.3(b)  illustrates why phase matching  is  impossible with uniform plane waves when θ 
> θc;  kz  >  kt  .  Therefore the λz determined by λ and θi is less than λt, the natural wavelength of 
the  transmission medium  at  frequency ω.  A  non-uniform  plane wave  is  then  required  for  phase 
matching, as discussed below.

(9.2.34) 

This is the same expression as (9.2.19), which was obtained for normal incidence, except that the 
magnetic field and wave now decay with distance x from the interface rather than propagating in 
that direction.  Also, since sinθt > 1 for θi > θc, cosθt is now imaginary and positive, and  H  is not 
in  phase  with  E .
  As  a  result,  Poynting’s  vector  for  these  surface  waves  has  a  real  part 
corresponding  to  real  power  propagating  parallel  to  the  surface,  and  an  imaginary  part 
corresponding  to  reactive  power  flowing  perpendicular  to  the  surface  in  the  direction  of  wave

Since  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  S   are  orthogonal,  there  is  no  decay  in  the  direction  of 
propagation,  and  therefore  no  power  absorption  or  heating  of  the  media.    Beyond  the  critical 
angle  θc  the  power  is  perfectly  reflected.    In  the  next  section  we  shall  see  that  the  real  and 
imaginary parts of  S  are often neither orthogonal nor parallel. 

9.2.4  Waves in lossy media 

Sometimes  one  or  both  of  the  two  media  are  conductive.    This  section  explores  the  nature  of 
waves  propagating  in  such  lossy media  having  conductivity σ > 0.  Section  9.2.5  then  discusses 
reflections  from  such  media.    Losses  can  also  arise  if  ε  or  μ  are  complex.    The  quasistatic 
relaxation  of  charge,  current,  and  field  distributions  in  lossy  media  is  discussed  separately  in 
Section 4.3. 

We  can  determine  the  nature  of  waves  in  lossy  media  using  the  approach  of  Section  2.3.3 
and including the conduction currents  J  in Ampere’s law: 

H J +  ωεj E = σ E +  ωεE =  jωεeff E 
j 
∇ ×  = 

where the effective complex permittivity  εeff  is: 

εeff  = ε ⎣⎡1 − ( jσ ωε )⎤⎦ 

(9.2.37)

(9.2.38) 

The quantity σ/ωε  is  called  the  loss  tangent of  the medium  and  indicates how  fast waves decay. 
As we shall see, waves propagate well if σ << ωε, and decay rapidly if σ > ωε, sometimes within 
a fraction of a wavelength. 

 

Substituting  εeff  for ε in k2 = ω2με yields the dispersion relation:

k  = ω  με ⎡⎣1 − ( jσ ωε )⎤⎦ = ( k '− jk

This wave has wavelength λ′, frequency ω, and phase velocity vp inside the conductor related by: 

k '   2= π λ ' = ω vp 

(9.2.42) 

and the wave decays exponentially with z as e-k"z = e-z/Δ .  Note that the wave decays in the same 
 
direction as  it propagates, corresponding  to power dissipation, and  that  the 1/e penetration depth 
Δ is 1/k" meters.  Inside conductors, λ′ and vp are much less than their free-space values. 

We  now  need  to  determine  k'  and  k".    In  general, matching  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of 
(9.2.39) yields two equations that can be solved for k' and k":

However, in the limits of very high or very low values of the loss tangent σ/ωε, it is much easier 
to evaluate (9.2.39) directly.

Taylor  series approximation  1 + δ  ≅ 1 + δ/2  for δ << 1.  In  this  limit we  see  from  (9.2.45)  that 
λ′  and  vp  ≅  c  are  approximately  the  same  as  they  are  for  the  lossless  case,  and  that  the  1/e 
penetration depth Δ ≅ 2/ση, which becomes extremely large as σ → 0. 

In the high loss limit where σ >> ωε, (9.2.39) yields:

The  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  k  have  the  same magnitudes,  and  the  choice  of  sign  determines 
the direction of propagation.  The wave generally decays exponentially as it propagates, although 
exponential  growth  occurs  in  media  with  negative  conductivity.    The  penetration  depth  is 
commonly called the skin depth δ in this limit (σ >> ωε), where:

wavelength  λ'  inside  the  conductor  are  extremely  small  compared  to  the  free-space  wavelength 
λ; thus: 

' 2π k ' = 2πδ  [m ]	
λ = 

(wavelength in conductor) 

(9.2.49)

These distances δ and λ' are extremely short in common metals such as copper (σ ≅ 5.8×107,  μ = 
μo) at frequencies such as 1 GHz, where δ ≅ 2×10-6 m and λ' ≅ 13×10-6 m, which are roughly five 
orders of magnitude smaller than the 30-cm free space wavelength.  The phase velocity vp of the 
wave is reduced by the same large factor. 

In the high conductivity limit, the wave impedance of the medium also becomes complex:

where  +j  is  consistent  with  a  decaying  wave  in  a  lossy  medium.    The  imaginary  part  of  η 
corresponds to power dissipation, and is non-zero whenever σ ≠ 0. 

Often  we  wish  to  shield  electronics  from  unwanted  external  radiation  that  could  introduce 
noise,  or  to  ensure  that  no  radiation  escapes  to  produce  radio  frequency  interference  (RFI)  that 
affects  other  systems.    Although  the  skin  depth  effect  shields  electromagnetic  radiation,  high 
conductivity  will  reflect  most  incident  radiation  in  any  event.    Conductors  generally  provide 
good  shielding  at  higher  frequencies  for  which  the  time  intervals  are  short  compared  to  the 
magnetic  relaxation  time  (4.3.15)  while  remaining  long  compared  to  the  charge  relaxation  time 
(4.3.3);  Section  4.3.2  and  Example  4.3B  present  examples  of  magnetic  field  diffusion  into 
conductors. 

Example 9.2C 
A uniform plane wave propagates at frequency f = c/λ = 1 MHz in a medium characterized by εo, 
μo, and conductivity σ.  If σ ≅ 10-3ωεo, over what distance D would the wave amplitude decay by 
a factor of 1/e?  What would be the 1/e wave penetration depth δ in a good conductor having σ ≅ 
1011ωε at this frequency? 

Solution:	

In  the  low-loss  limit  where  σ  <<  ωε,  k  ≅ ω/c  -  jση/2  (9.2.45),  so  E  ∝  e-σηz/2  =  e-z/D 
where D = 2/ση = 2(εo/μo)0.5/10-3ωεo = 2000c/ω ≅ 318λ  [m].    In  the high-loss  limit k

≅ (1 ± j)(ωμσ/2)0.5 so E ∝ e-z/δ, where δ = (2/ωμσ)0.5 = (2×10-11/ω2με)0.5 = (2×10-11)0.5 
λ/2π ≅ 7.1×10-7λ = 0.21 mm.   This conductivity corresponds  to  typical metal and  the 
resulting penetration depth is a tiny fraction of a free-space wavelength. 

9.2.5  Waves incident upon good conductors 

This  section  focuses  primarily  on  waves  propagating  inside  good  conductors.    The  field 
distributions produced outside good conductors by  the superposition of waves  incident upon and 
reflected from them are discussed in Section 9.2.3. 

Section 9.2.4 showed that uniform plane waves in lossy conductors decay as they propagate. 
The wave propagation constant k is then complex in order to characterize exponential decay with 
distance: 

k

k ' 
= − jk "

 

The form of a uniform plane wave in lossy media is therefore:

E r  = yˆ E  eo

(9.2.51)

(9.2.52) 

When  a  plane wave  impacts  a  conducting  surface  at  an  angle,  a  complex wave  propagation 
vector  k t   is  required  to  represent  the  resulting  transmitted wave.    The  real  and  imaginary  parts 
of  k t  are generally at some angle to each other.  The result is a non-uniform plane wave because 
its intensity is non-uniform across each phase front. 

To  illustrate  how  such  transmitted  non-uniform  plane waves  can  be  found,  consider  a  lossy 
transmission medium  characterized by  ε, σ,  and μ, where we  can  combine  ε and σ into  a  single 
effective complex permittivity, as done in (9.2.38)48:

Once  a  plane  of  incidence  such  as  the  x-z  plane  is  defined,  this  relation  has  four  scalar 
unknowns—the real and imaginary parts for each of the x and z (in-plane) components of  k .  At 
a planar boundary  there are four such unknowns for each of  the reflected and  transmitted waves, 
or  a  total  of  eight  unknowns.  Each  of  these  four  components  of  k   (real  and  imaginary,  parallel 
and  perpendicular)  must  satisfy  a  boundary  condition,  yielding  four  equations.   The  dispersion 
relation  (9.2.55)  has  real  and  imaginary  parts  for  each  side  of  the  boundary,  thus  providing  four 
more  equations.  The  resulting  set  of  eight  equations  can  be  solved  for  the  eight  unknowns,  and 
generally  lead  to  real  and  imaginary  parts  for  k t   that  are  neither  parallel  nor  perpendicular  to 
each other or to the boundary.  That is, the real and imaginary parts of  k  and  S  can point in four 
different directions. 

It is useful to consider the special case of reflections from planar conductors for which σ >> 
ωε. 
In  this  limit  the  solution  is  simple  because  the  transmitted  wave  inside  the  conductor 
propagates  almost  perpendicular  to  the  interface,  which  can  be  shown  as  follows.    Equation 
(9.2.47) gave the propagation constant k for a uniform plane wave in a medium with σ >> ωε: 

k ≅ ± ωμσ ( 
)

(9.2.56)

The  real  part  of  such  a  k   is  so  large  that  even  for  grazing  angles  of  incidence,  θi  ≅ 90o,  the 
transmission  angle  θt  must  be  nearly  zero  in  order  to  match  phases,  as  suggested  by  Figure 
9.2.3(a)  in  the  limit  where  kt  is  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  ki.    As  a  result,  the  power 
dissipated  in  the  conductor  is  essentially  the  same  as  for  θi  =  0o,  and  therefore  depends  in  a 
simple way on the induced surface current and parallel surface magnetic field  H . 
is simply 
// H // 
twice that associated with the incident wave alone  ( H⊥ ≅ 0 ) ; essentially all the incident power is 
reflected so  the  incident and  reflected waves have  the same amplitudes and  their magnetic  fields 
add. 

The  power  density  Pd  [W  m-2]  dissipated  by  waves  traveling  in  the  +z  direction  in 
conductors with an interface at z = 0 can be found using the Poynting vector:

The  significance  of  this  result  is  that  it  simplifies  calculation  of  power  dissipated  when  waves 
impact  conductors—we  need  only  evaluate  the  surface magnetic  field  under  the  assumption  the 
conductor is perfect, and then use (9.2.61) to compute the power dissipated per square meter. 

Example 9.2D 
What  fraction  of  the  10-GHz  power  reflected  by  a  satellite  dish  antenna  is  resistively  dissipated 
in  the metal  if σ = 5×107 Siemens per meter?   Assume normal  incidence.   A wire of diameter D 
and  made  of  the  same  metal  carries  a  current  I.  What  is  the  approximate  power  dissipated  per

9.2.6  Duality and TM waves at dielectric boundaries 

Transverse magnetic  (TM) waves  reflect  from  planar  surfaces  just  as  do  TE waves,  except with 
different  amplitudes  as  a  function  of  angle.    The  angles  of  reflection  and  transmission  are  the 

- 274 -

same  as  for  TE  waves,  however,  because  both  TE  and  TM  waves  must  satisfy  the  same  phase 
matching boundary condition (9.2.25). 

The  behavior  of  TE  waves  at  planar  boundaries  is  characterized  by  equations  (9.2.14)  and 
(9.2.15) for the incident electric and magnetic fields, (9.2.16) and (9.2.17) for the reflected wave, 
and (9.2.18) and (9.2.19) for the transmitted wave, supplemented by expressions for the complex 
reflection and transmission coefficients Γ = Er/Eo, (9.2.28), and T = Et/Eo, (9.2.29).  Although the 
analogous  behavior  of  TM  waves  could  be  derived  using  the  same  boundary-value  problem 
solving method used in Section 9.2.2 for TE waves, the principle of duality can provide the same 
solutions with much less effort. 

Duality  works  because  Maxwell’s  equations  without  charges  or  currents  are  duals  of 
themselves.    That  is,  by  transforming  E ⇒ H ,  H ⇒ −E ,  and  ε ⇔ μ,  the  set  of  Maxwell’s 
equations is unchanged: 

∇ × E = −μ∂ H  ∂t  →

(9.2.63) 

(9.2.64) 

(9.2.65) 

The  transformed  set of equations on  the  right-hand  side of  (9.2.62)  to  (9.2.65)  is  the same as  the 
original, although sequenced differently.  As a result, any solution to Maxwell’s equations is also 
a  solution  to  the  dual  problem  where  the  variables  and  boundary  conditions  are  all  transformed 
as indicated above. 

The  boundary  conditions  derived  in  Section  2.6  for  a  planar  interface  between  two 
insulating  uncharged  media  are  that  E // ,  H // ,  μH⊥ ,  and  εE⊥   be  continuous  across  the 
boundary. Since the duality transformation leaves these boundary conditions unchanged, they are 
dual  too.  However,  duality  cannot  be  used,  for  example,  in  the  presence  of  perfect  conductors 
that force  E //  to zero, but not  H // .

Figure  9.2.5(b)  illustrates  a  TM  plane  wave  incident  upon  a  planar  boundary  where  both  the 
wave and the boundary conditions are dual to the TE wave illustrated in (a). 

The behavior of TM waves at planar boundaries between non-conducting media is therefore 
characterized  by  duality  transformations  of  Equations  (9.2.62–65)  for  TE  waves,  supplemented 
by  similar  transformations  of  the  expressions  for  the  complex  reflection  and  transmission 
coefficients  Γ =  Er/Eo,  (9.2.28),  and  T  =  Et/Eo,  (9.2.29).  After  the  transformations  E ⇒ H ,

Figure 9.2.6  Power reflected from planar dielectric interfaces for μ = μt. 
 

Figure  9.2.6  reveals  an  important  phenomenon—there  is  perfect  transmission  at  Brewster’s 
angle  θB  for  one  of  the  two  polarizations.    In  this  case  Brewster’s  angle  occurs  for  the  TM 
polarization  because  μ  is  the  same  everywhere  and  ε is  not,  and  it  would  occur  for  TE 
polarization if μ varied across the boundary while ε did not.  This phenomenon is widely used in 
glass  Brewster-angle windows when  even  the  slightest  reflection must  be  avoided  or when  pure 
linear polarization is required (the reflected wave is pure). 

We  can  compute  θB  by  noting  Hr/Ho  and,  using  (9.2.72),  ηn  =  1.   If  μ =  μt,  then  (9.2.74) 
0.5  cos  θi  =  ε0.5  cos  θt.  Snell’s  law  for  μ =  μt  yields  ε0.5  sin  θi  =  εt
0.5  sin  θt.  These  two 
yields  εt
equations are satisfied  if sin θi = cos θt and cos θi =  sin θt.  Dividing  this  form of Snell’s  law by 
[cos θi = sin θt] yields: tan θi = (εt/εi)0.5, or: 

1  ε ε 
θ = tan − 
B
t 
i 

(9.2.75) 

Moreover, dividing [sin θi = cos θt] by [cos θi = sin θt] yields tan θB = cos θt, which implies θB + 
θt  =  90°.  Using  this  equation  it  is  easy  to  show  that  θB  >  45o  for  interfaces  where  θt  <  θi,  and 
when θt > θi, it follows that θB < 45o. 

One  way  to  physically  interpret  Brewster’s  angle  for  TM  waves  is  to  note  that  at  θB  the 
polar  axes  of  the  electric  dipoles  induced  in  the  second  dielectric  εt  are  pointed  exactly  at  the 
angle  of  reflection  mandated  by  phase  matching,  but  dipoles  radiate  nothing  along  their  polar 
axis;  Figure  9.2.6(b)  illustrates  the  geometry.    That  is,  θB  +  θt  =  90o.    For  magnetic  media 

- 277 -


magnetic  dipoles  are  induced,  and  for TE waves  their  axes  point  in  the  direction  of  reflection  at 
Brewster’s angle. 

Yet another way  to physically  interpret Brewster’s angle  is  to note  that perfect  transmission 
can  be  achieved  if  the  boundary  conditions  can  be  matched  without  invoking  a  reflected  wave. 
This  requires  existence  of  a  pair  of  incidence  and  transmission  angles  θi  and  θt  such  that  the 
parallel  components  of  both  E   and  H   for  these  two waves match  across  the  boundary.    Such  a 
pair  consistent with  Snell’s  law  always  exists  for TM waves  at  planar  dielectric  boundaries,  but 
not for TE waves.  Thus there is perfect impedance matching at Brewster’s angle. 

Example 9.2E 
What  is  Brewster’s  angle  θB  if  μ2  =  4μ1,  and  ε2  =  ε1,  and  for  which  polarization  would  the 
phenomenon be observed? 

Solution:	

If  the  permeabilities  differ,  but  not  the  permittivities,  then  Brewster’s  angle  is 
observed  only  for  TE  waves.  At  Brewster’s  angle  θB + θ t  = 90° ,  and  Snell’s  law

parallel  to  the  conductor  must  be  zero,  implying  E r  = −Eo .  The  superposition  of  these  two

Because  kx  =  2π/λx,  these  planes  of  electric-field  nulls  are  located  at  xnulls  =  nλx/2.  A  second 
perfect  conductor  could  be  inserted  at  any  one  of  these  x  planes  so  that  the waves would  reflect 
back  and  forth  and  propagate  together  in  the  +z  direction,  trapped  between  the  two  conducting 
planes. 

We  can  easily  confirm  that  the  boundary  conditions  are  satisfied  for  the  corresponding 
magnetic field  H ( x , z )  by using Faraday’s law:

Equation  (9.3.4),  kxd  =  nπ  (n  =  1,  2,...),  is  the  guidance  condition  for  parallel-plate

parallel  plates.  We  can  use  this  guidance  condition  to make  the  expressions  (9.3.3)  and  (9.3.5) 
for  E  and  H  more explicit by replacing kxx with nπx/d, and kz with 2π/λz:

These  electric  and  magnetic  fields  correspond  to  a  waveguide  mode  propagating  in  the  +z

* 
The direction of propagation  can be  inferred  from  the Poynting vector  S E = × H  .  Because  this 
is  a  TE wave  and  there  is  only  one  half wavelength  between  the  two  conducting  plates  (n  =  1), 
this is designated the TE1 mode of a parallel-plate waveguide.  Because Maxwell’s equations are 
linear, several propagating modes with different values of n can be active simultaneously and be 
superimposed.

These  fields are periodic  in both  the x and z directions.   The wavelength λz along  the z axis

Figure 9.3.3  Evanescent TE1 mode in a parallel-plate waveguide. 
 

If  we  reflect  a  TM  wave  from  a  perfect  conductor  there  again  will  be  planar  loci  where 
additional perfectly  conducting plates  could be placed without violating boundary conditions, as 
suggested  in Figure  9.3.1(b)  for  the TM1 mode.   Note  that  the  field  configuration  is  the  same  as 
for  the TE1 mode,  except  that  E   and  H  have been  interchanged  (allowed by duality)  and phase 
shifted in the lateral direction to match boundary conditions.  Between the plates the TE and TM 
field solutions are dual, as discussed in Section 9.2.6.  Also note that TEM = TM01. 

Evaluation of Poynting’s vector reveals that the waves in Figure 9.3.1 are propagating to the 
right.  If  this  waveguide  mode  were  superimposed  with  an  equal-strength  wave  traveling  to  the 
left,  the  resulting  field pattern would be  similar,  but  the magnetic  and  electric  field distributions 
E t( )  and  H t( )  would be shifted relative to one another by λz/4 along the z axis, and they would 
be 90o out of phase  in  time;  the  time-average power  flow would be zero, and  the  reactive power 
{ }
I S  would  alternate  between  inductive  (+j)  and  capacitive  (-j)  at  intervals  of  λz/2  down  the
m
waveguide. 

Because kz/ω is frequency dependent, the shapes of waveforms evolve as they propagate.  If 
 
the  signal  is narrowband,  this  evolution  can be characterized  simply  by  noting  that  the  envelope 
of the waveform propagates at the “group velocity” vg, and the modulated sinusoidal wave inside 
the  envelope  propagates  at  the  “phase  velocity”  vp,  as  discussed  more  fully  in  Section  9.5.2. 
These velocities are easily found from k(ω): vp = ω/k and vg = (∂k/∂ω)-1.

approaches  the  cut-off  frequency ωTEn  from above.   The group velocity vg, which  is  the velocity 
of  energy  or  information  propagation,  equals  dω/dk,  which  is  the  local  slope  of  the  dispersion 
relation ω(k) and can never exceed c.  Both vp and vg approach c = (με)-0.5 as ω → ∞.

9.3.2  Rectangular waveguides 

Waves  can  be  trapped  within  conducting  cylinders  and  propagate  along  their  axis,  rectangular 
and  cylindrical  waveguides  being  the  most  common  examples.    Consider  the  rectangular 
waveguide illustrated in Figure 9.3.5.  The fields inside it must satisfy the wave equation:

Since  the  wave  equation  requires  that  the  second  spatial  derivative  of  E   or  H   equal  E   or 
H times  a  constant,  these  fields must  be  products of  sinusoids  or  exponentials  along  each  of  the 
three  cartesian  coordinates,  or  sums  of  such  products.    For  example,  the  wave  equation  and

We  can  already  compute  the  cut-off  frequency of propagation ωmn  for  each mode,  assuming

Since  a  ≥  b  by  definition,  and  the  0,0  mode  cannot  have  non-zero  fields,  as  shown  later,  the 
lowest frequency that can propagate is: 

ω = π c a
10 

(9.3.23)

which  implies  that  the  longest  wavelength  that  can  propagate  in  rectangular  waveguide  is 
λmax  =  2πc/ω10  =  2a.  If  a  >  2b,  the  second  lowest  cut-off  frequency  is  ω20  =  2ω10,  so  such 
waveguides  can  propagate  only  a  single  mode  over  no  more  than  an  octave  (factor  of  2  in 
frequency) before another propagating mode  is added.   The parallel-plate waveguides of Section 
9.3.1 exhibited similar properties. 

Returning  to  the  field  solutions,  E   must  also  satisfy  Gauss’s  law,  ∇ • ε E 0 = 
,  within  the 
waveguide, where ε is constant and Ez  ≡ 0 for TE waves.  This implies:

A  similar  procedure  yields  the  fields  for  the  TM modes;  their  form  is  similar  to  the  TE  modes, 
but  with  E   and  H   interchanged  and  then  shifted  spatially  to  match  boundary  conditions.    The 
validity  of  field  solutions  where E   and  H   are  interchanged  also  follows  from  the  principle  of 
duality, discussed in Section 9.2.6. 

The most widely used rectangular waveguide mode is TE10, often called the dominant mode, 
where  the  first  digit  corresponds  to  the  number  of  half-wavelengths  along  the  wider  side  of  the 
guide  and  the  second  digit  applies  to  the  narrower  side.    For  this mode  the  guidance  conditions 
yield  kx  =  0  and  ky  =  π/a,  where  a  ≥  b  by  convention.  Thus  the  fields  (9.3.27)  and  (9.3.28) 
become:

The fields for this mode are roughly sketched in Figure 9.3.5 for a wave propagating in the plus-
z  direction.  The  electric  field  varies  as  the  sine  across  the  width  a,  and  is  uniform  across  the 
height b of  the guide; at any  instant  it also varies sinusoidally along z.   Hy varies as  the sine of y 
across  the  width  b,  while  Hx  varies  as  the  cosine;  both  are  uniform  in  x  and  vary  sinusoidally 
along z. 

The  forms  of  evanescent  modes  are  easily  found.    For  example,  the  electric  and  magnetic

The  main  differences  are  that  for  the  evanescent  wave:  1)  the  field  distribution  at  the  origin 
simply  decays  exponentially  with  distance  z  and  the  fields  lose  their  wave  character  since  they 
wax  and wane  in  synchrony  at  all  positions,  2)  the  electric  and magnetic  fields  vary  90  degrees 
out  of  phase  so  that  the  total  energy  storage  alternates  twice  per  cycle  between  being  purely 
electric and purely magnetic, and 3)  the energy flux becomes purely reactive since the real (time 
average) power flow is zero.  The same differences apply to any evanscent TEmn or TMmn mode.

Example 9.3B 
What  modes  have  the  four  lowest  cutoff  frequencies  for  a  rectangular  waveguide  having  the 
dimensions  a  =  1.2b?   For  the  TE10  mode,  where  can  we  cut  thin  slots  in  the  waveguide  walls 
such that they transect no currents and thus have no deleterious effect? 

Solution:	 The cut-off frequencies (9.3.22) are: ωmn = [(mπc/a)2 + (nπc/b)2]0.5, so the lowest cut­
off  is  for TEmn = TE10,  since TE00, TM00, TM01,  and TM10  do  not  exist.  Next  comes 
TE11  and  TM11,  followed  by  TE20.  The wall  currents  are  perpendicular  to⎯H, which 
has no x component for the dominant mode (9.3.30); see Figure 9.3.5.  Therefore thin 
slots  cut  in  the  x  direction  in  the  sidewalls  (y  =  0,a)  will  never  transect  current  or 
perturb  the  TE10  mode.    In  addition,  the  figure  and  (9.3.30)  show  that  the  z-directed 
currents  at  the  center  of  the  top  and  bottom  walls  are  also  always  zero,  so  thin  z-
directed  slots  at  those midlines  do  not  perturb  the TE10 mode  either.    Small  antennas 
placed  through  thin  slots  or  holes  in  such  waveguides  are  sometimes  used  to 
introduce or extract signals. 

9.3.3  Excitation of waveguide modes 

Energy  can  be  radiated  inside  waveguides  and  resonators  by  antennas.    We  can  compute  the 
energy  radiated  into  each  waveguide  or  resonator  mode  using  modal  expansions  for  the  fields 
and matching the boundary conditions imposed by the given source current distribution  J . 

 
Consider  a waveguide  of  cross-section  a×b  and  uniform  in  the  z  direction, where  a  ≥  b.    If  
we  assume  the  source  current  J s   is  confined  at  z =  0  to  a wire  or  current  sheet  in  the  x,y  plane, 
then  the  associated magnetic  fields  H +   and  H −   at  z  =  0  ± δ  ,  respectively  (δ→0), must  satisfy 
the boundary condition (2.1.11): 

H + − H − = J s × zˆ

the boundary at z = 0, assuming there are no other sources present, so:

)	

 

(9.3.34) 

To  illustrate  the method we  restrict  ourselves  to  the  simple  case  of TEm,0 modes,  for which 
E  and  J s  are  in  the x direction.  The  total magnetic field (9.3.28) summed over all TEm,0 modes

Because  sine  waves  of  different  frequencies  are  orthogonal  when  integrated  over  an  integral 
number  of  half-wavelengths  at  each  frequency,  the  integral  on  the  left-hand  side  is  zero  unless 
m  =  n.  Therefore  we  have  a  simple  way  to  evaluate  the  phase  and  magnitude  of  each  excited 
mode:

Not  all  excited  modes  propagate  real  power,  however.    Modes  n  with  cutoff  frequencies 
2  -  (nπ/a)2]0.5  is  imaginary.    The  associated  magnetic  field 
above  ω  are  evanescent,  so  kzn  =  [ko
remains in phase with Js and real, and therefore the power in each evanescent wave is imaginary. 
Since  all modes  are  orthogonal  in  space,  their  powers  add;  for  evanescent modes  the  imaginary 
power  corresponds  to  net  stored  magnetic  or  electric  energy.    The  reactance  at  the  input  to  the 
wires driving  the  current  Js  is  therefore  either  capacitive or  inductive, depending on whether  the 
total energy stored in the reactive modes is predominantly electric or magnetic, respectively. 

A  more  intuitive  way  to  understand  modal  excitation  is  to  recognize  that  the  power  P 
delivered to the waveguide by a current distribution  J  is:

P =  ∫∫∫ E • Js  dv

and therefore any mode for which the field distribution  E  is orthogonal to  J s  will not be excited, 
and  vice  versa.  For  example,  a  straight  wire  in  the  x  direction  across  a  waveguide  carrying 
current  at  some  frequency  ω will  excite  all  TEn0 modes  that  have  non-zero  E   at  the  position  of 
the  wire;  modes  with  cutoff  frequencies  above  ω  will  contribute  only  reactance  to  the  current 
source,  while  the  propagating  modes  will  contribute  a  real  part.    Proper  design  of  the  current 
distribution  J s  can permit any combination of modes to be excited, while not exciting the rest.

Cavity resonators 

9.4.1  Rectangular cavity resonators 

Rectangular cavity resonators are hollow  rectangular conducting boxes of width a, height b, and 
length  d,  where  d  ≥ a  ≥ b  by  convention.  Since  they  are  simply  rectangular  waveguides 
terminated  at  both  ends  by  conducting  walls,  and  the  electric  fields  must  still  obey  the  wave 
2με
2
equation,  ( ∇ +  ω ) E 0 ,  therefore  E   for  TE  modes  must  have  the  form  of  the  TE 
=
waveguide  fields  (9.3.27),  but  with  a  sinusoidal  z  dependence  that  matches  the  boundary 
conditions  at  z  =  0  and  z  =  d;  for  example,  equal  forward-  and  backward-propagating  waves 
would form the standing wave: 

o  o  ( ˆ y

(9.4.1) 

where B = 0 ensures  E //  = 0 at z = 0, and kz = pπ/d ensures it for z = d, where p = 1, 2, ... 

Unlike  rectangular  waveguides  that  propagate  any  frequency  above  cut-off  for  the  spatial 
field  distribution  (mode)  of  interest,  cavity  resonators  operate  only  at  specific  resonant 
frequencies  or  combinations  of  them  in  order  to  match  all  boundary  conditions.    The  resonant 
frequencies ωmnp for a rectangular cavity resonator follow from the dispersion relation:

The fundamental mode for a cavity resonator is the lowest frequency mode.  Since boundary 
conditions  can  not  be met  unless  at  least  two  of  the  quantum  numbers m,  n,  and  p  are  non-zero, 
the  lowest resonant frequency  is associated with  the  two  longest dimensions, d and a.  Therefore 
the lowest resonant frequency is:

Cavity  resonators are  therefore  sometimes  filled with dielectrics or magnetic materials  to  reduce 
their resonant frequencies by reducing c. 

The  fields  for  the  fundamental  mode  of  a  rectangular  cavity  resonator,  TE101,  follow  from

The  total  energy  w  [J]  =  we(t)  +  wm(t)  in  each  mode  m,n,p  of  a  cavity  resonator  can  be 
calculated using (2.7.28) and (2.7.29), and will decay exponentially at a rate that depends on total 
power dissipation Pd [W] due to losses in the walls and in any insulator filling the cavity interior:

Wall  losses  and  any  dissipation  in  insulators  can  be  estimated  by  integrating  (9.2.60)  and 
(2.7.30),  respectively,  over  the  volume  of  the  cavity  resonator.    The  energy  stored,  power 
dissipation,  and  Q  can  be  quite  different  for  different  modes,  and  are  characterized  by  wmnp, 
Pd,mnp, and Qmnp, respectively, as defined by either (3.5.23) or (7.4.43): 

Qmnp  = ωwmnp  Pdmnp

Solution:  	 The  lowest  resonant  frequency  ω101  is  given  by  (9.4.4),  where  c  =  (με)-0.5:  ω101  =

Perturbation of resonator frequencies 

Often  we  would  like  to  tune  a  resonance  to  some  nearby  frequency.    This  can  generally  be 
accomplished by changing the shape of the resonator slightly.  Although the relationship between 
shape  and  resonant  frequency  can  be  evaluated  using Maxwell’s  equations,  a  simpler  and  more 
physical approach is taken here. 

The  energy  stored  in  a  resonator  can  be  regarded  as  a  population  of  N  trapped  photons  at 
frequency f bouncing about inside.  Since the energy E per photon is hf (1.1.10), the total energy 
in the resonator is: 

w T  = Nhf	 [J

] 

(9.4.9) 

- 289 -


If we  force  the walls  of  a  resonator  to move  slowly  toward  its new  shape,  they will move  either 
opposite  to  the forces  imposed by  the electromagnetic fields  inside, or  in  the same direction, and 
thereby do positive or negative work,  respectively, on  those  fields.    If we do positive work,  then 
the  total  electromagnetic  energy  wT  must  increase.    Since  the  number  of  photons  remains 
constant  if  the  shape  change  is  slow  compared  to  the  frequency,  positive  work  on  the  fields 
results  in  increased  electromagnetic  energy  and  frequency  f.    If  the  resonator walls move  in  the 
direction  of  the  applied  electromagnetic  forces,  the  externally  applied  work  on  the  fields  is 
negative and the energy and resonant frequency decrease. 

The  paradigm  above  leads  to  a  simple  expression  for  the  change  in  resonant  frequency  of 
any resonator due to small physical changes.  Consider the case of an air-filled metallic cavity of 
any  shape  that  is  perturbed  by  pushing  in  or  out  the  walls  slightly  in  one  or  more  places.    The 
electromagnetic  force on a conductor has components associated with both  the attractive electric 
and repulsive magnetic pressures on conductors given by (4.1.15) and (4.1.23), respectively.  For 
sinusoidal waves these pressures are: 

Pe  = −ε o

(electric pressure) 

(9.4.10)

(magnetic pressure) 

(9.4.11)

But  these  pressures,  except  for  the  negative  sign  of  Pe  (corresponding  to  attraction),  are  the 
electric and magnetic energy densities [J m-3].

The work Δw done in moving the cavity boundary slightly is the pressure Pe/m applied, times 
 
the  area  over  which  it  is  applied,  times  the  distance moved  perpendicular  to  the  boundary.    For 
example, Δw equals the inward electromagnetic pressure (± energy density) times the increase in 
volume added by  the moving boundary.   But  this  increase  in  total  stored electromagnetic energy 
is simply: 

Δw T  = Nh

 Δf  = − (Pe + Pm )Δvolume

= Δ w e − Δ w m 
 

(9.4.12) 

The  signs  for  the  increases  in  electric  and magnetic  energy  storage  Δwe  and  Δwm  and  pressures 
Pe  and  Pm  are  different  because  the  pressures  Pe  and  Pm  are  in  opposite  directions, where Δwe = 
WeΔvol,  and  Δwm  =  -PmΔvol  =  -WmΔvol.  Δwe  is  defined  as  the  electric  energy  stored  in  the 
increased volume of  the cavity, Δvol, assuming  the electric  field strength  remains constant as  the 
wall moves slightly; Δwm  is defined similarly.   The main  restriction here  is  that  the walls cannot 
be moved so  far  that  the  force density on  the walls changes, nor can  their shape change abruptly 
for  the  same  reason.  For  example,  a  sharp  point  concentrates  electric  fields  and  would  violate 
this constraint. 

Dividing (9.4.12) by wT = Nhf yields the frequency perturbation equation:

(9.4.13)

A  simple  example  illustrates  its  use.    Consider  a  rectangular  cavity  resonator  operating  in 
the TE101 mode with the fields given by (5.4.37) and (5.4.38).  If we push in the center of the top 
or bottom of  the cavity where  H 0  and  E 0  we are reducing  the volume allocated  to electric 
≅
≠
energy  storage,  so Δwe  is negative  and  the  resonant  frequency will drop  in  accord with  (9.4.13). 
If  we  push  in  the  sides,  however,  the  resonant  frequency  will  increase  because  we  are  reducing 
the  volume where magnetic  energy  is  stored  and Δwm  is  negative;  the  electric  energy  density  at 
the  sidewalls  is  zero.  In  physical  terms,  pushing  in  the  top  center  where  the  electric  fields  pull 
inward on the wall means that those fields are doing work on the moving wall and therefore lose 
energy  and  frequency.  Pushing  in where  the magnetic  fields  are pushing outward does work on 
the  fields,  increasing  their  energy  and  frequency.    This  technique  can  be  used  to  determine 
experimentally the unknown resonant mode of a cavity as well as tuning it. 

9.5  Waves in complex media 

9.5.1  Waves in anisotropic media 

There  are  many  types  of  media  that  can  be  analyzed  simply  using  Maxwell’s  equations,  which 
characterize  media  by  their  permittivity  ε,  permeability  μ,  and  conductivity  σ.  In  general  ε,  η, 
and σ  can  be  complex,  frequency  dependent,  and  functions  of  field  direction.   They  can  also  be 
functions  of  density,  temperature,  field  strength,  and  other  quantities.    Moreover  they  can  also 
couple⎯E to⎯B, and⎯H  to⎯D.  In  this section we only  treat  the special cases of anisotropic media 
(Section 9.5.1), dispersive media (Section 9.5.2), and plasmas (Section 9.5.3).  Lossy media were 
treated in Sections 9.2.4 and 9.2.5. 

Anisotropic  media,  by  definition,  have  permittivities,  permeabilities,  and/or  conductivities 
that  are  functions  of  field  direction.    We  can  generally  represent  these  dependences  by  3×3 
matrices (tensors), i.e.: 

D = εE 

B = μH 

J = σE 

For example, (9.5.1) says: 

D x  = ε xx
D y  = ε yx
Dz  = ε zx

 E x  + ε xy
 E y  + ε xz
 E z 
 E x  + ε yy
 E y  + ε yz
 E z 
 E z 
 E y  + εzz
 E x  + εzy

(9.5.3) 

(9.5.4) 

Most  media  are  symmetric  so  that  εij  =  εji;  in  this  case  the  matrix  ε   can  always  be 
diagonalized  by  rotating  the  coordinate  system  to  define  new  directions  x,  y,  and  z  that  yield 
zeros off-axis: 

⎛ ε x

ε = ⎜
⎜  0
⎝ 

0 
ε y

0  ⎞ 
⎟ 
0  ⎟

z ⎠ 

(9.5.5) 

These  new  axes  are  called  the  principal  axes  of  the  medium.    The  medium  is  isotropic  if  the 
permittivities  of  these  three  axes  are  equal,  uniaxial  if  only  two  of  the  three  axes  are  equal,  and 
biaxial  if  all  three  differ.  For  example,  tetragonal,  hexagonal,  and  rhombohedral  crystals  are 
uniaxial,  and  orthorhombic,  monoclinic,  and  triclinic  crystals  are  biaxial.    Most  constitutive 
tensors  are  symmetric  (they  equal  their  own  transpose),  the  most  notable  exception  being 
permeability  tensors  for magnetized media  like  plasmas  and  ferrites,  which  are  hermetian49  and 
not discussed in this text. 

One immediate consequence of anisotropic permittivity and (9.5.4) is that  D  is generally no 
longer parallel to  E , as suggested in Figure 9.5.1 for a uniaxial medium.   When εxx  ≠ εzz,  E  and  
D   are  parallel  only  if  they  lie  along  one  of  the  principal  axes.    As  explained  shortly,  this 
property  of  uniaxial  or  biaxial  media  can  be  used  to  convert  any  wave  polarization  into  any 
other.

The  origins  of  anisotropy  in  media  are  easy  to  understand  in  terms  of  simple  models  for 
crystals.  For example, an isotropic cubic lattice becomes uniaxial if it is compressed or stretched 
along  one  of  those  axes,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  9.5.2(a)  for  z-axis  compression.    That  such 
compressed  columns  act  to  increase  the  effective  permittivity  in  their  axial  direction  can  be 
understood  by  noting  that  each  of  these  atomic  columns  functions  like  columns  of  dielectric 
between  capacitor  plates,  as  suggested  in  Figure  9.5.2(b).    Parallel-plate  capacitors  were 

49 Hermetian matrices equal the complex conjugate of their transpose.

one of the capacitor plates, as illustrated in Figure 9.5.2(c).

Even  though  half  the  volume  between  the  capacitor  plates  is  occupied  by  dielectric  in  both 
these  cases,  the  capacitance  for  the  columns  [Figure  9.5.2(b)]  is  greater,  corresponding  to  a 
greater  effective  permittivity  εeff.  This  can  be  shown  using Equation  (3.1.10), which  says  that  a 
parallel  plate  capacitor  has  C  =  εeffA/d, where A  is  the  plate  area  and  d  is  the  distance  between 
the plates.   The capacitances Ca and Cb  for Figures 9.5.2(b) and  (c) correspond  to  two capacitors 
in parallel and series, respectively, where:

In the limit where ε >> εo the permittivity ratio εeff(a)/ εeff(b) → ε/4εo > 1.  In all compressive cases 
εeff(a)  ≥ εeff(b).  If  the  crystal  were  stretched  rather  than  compressed,  this  inequality  would  be 
reversed.  Exotic complex materials can exhibit inverted behavior, however. 

Since  the  permittivity  here  interacts  directly  only  with  E ,  not  H ,  the  velocity  of 
propagation  c  =  1 /   με   depends  only  on  the  permittivity  in  the  direction  of  E .    We  therefore 
expect slower propagation of waves linearly polarized so that  E  is parallel to an axis with higher 
values  of  ε.  We  can  derive  this  behavior  from  the  source-free  Maxwell’s  equations  and  the 
matrix constitutive relation (9.5.4).

The wave equation  (9.5.14) characterizes  the propagation of x-polarized waves and  (9.5.15) 
characterizes  y-polarized  waves;  their  wave  velocities  are  (μεx)-0.5  and  (μεy)-0.5,  respectively.    If 
εx  ≠ εy  then  the  axis with  the  lower velocity  is  called  the  “slow”  axis,  and  the other  is  the  “fast” 
axis.  This  dual-velocity  phenomenon  is  called  birefringence.  That  our  assumption 
∇ • E 0   is 
=
correct  is  easily  seen  by  noting  that  the  standard  wave  solution  for  both  x-  and  y-  polarized 
waves  satisfies  these  constraints.    Since  ∇  is  distributive,  the  equation  is  also  satisfied  for 
arbitrary linear combinations of x- and y- polarized waves, which is the most general case here. 

(9.5.14)

(9.5.15)

If  a  wave  has  both  x-  and  y-polarized  components,  the  polarization  of  their  superposition 
will  evolve  as  they  propagate  along  the  z  axis  at  different  velocities.    For  example,  a  linearly 
wave  polarized  at  45  degrees  to  the  x  and  y  axes  will  evolve  into  elliptical  and  then  circular 
polarization before evolving back into linear polarization orthogonal to the input. 

This ability of a birefringent medium  to  transform polarization  is  illustrated  in Figure 9.5.3. 
In this case we can represent the linearly polarized wave at z = 0 as: 

( = )  E o  x + y )

(9.5.16)

Polarization  conversion  is  commonly  used  in  optical  systems  to  convert  linear  polarization 
to  circular,  or  vice-versa,  via  a  quarter-wave  plate  for  which  Δφ  is  90o,  equivalent  to  a  quarter

this same plate rotate appropriate linear polarization 90 degrees? 

− jk  D 
Solution:  	 The  phase  lags  along  the  x  and  y  axes  arise  from  e− jk  D and e 
y
,  respectively, 
x
and  the difference  is π/2 =  (ky  - kx)D  for a quarter-wave plate.   But ki = ω(μoεi)0.5,  so 
(ky  -  kx)D  = ω(μoεx)0.5[(1  +  1.001)0.5  -  1] D  ≅  (ω/cx)0.5  0.0005 D  =  π/2.  Since ω/cx  = 
2π/λx,  therefore  D  =  2000λx/4  where  λx  =  5×10-7(εo/εx)0.5.  Thus  D  =  500λx  =  0.18 
mm, which  is  approximately  the  thickness  of  a Vu-Graph  transparency  that  acts  as  a 
quarter-wave  plate.  A  differential  phase  lag  of  π  yields  90°  polarization  rotation  for 
waves  linearly  polarized  at  an  angle  45°  from  the  principal  axes  x  and  y,  so  the 
thickness would be doubled to ~0.36 mm. 

9.5.2  Waves in dispersive media 

Dispersive  media  have  wave  velocities  that  are  frequency  dependent  due  to  the  frequency 
dependence  of  μ,  ε,  or  σ.  These  frequency  dependencies  arise  in  all  materials  because  of  the 
non-instantaneous  physical  responses  of  electrons  to  fields.    Often  these  time  lags  are  so  brief 
that  only  at  optical  frequencies  do  they  become  a  significant  fraction  of  a  period,  although 
propagation  over  sufficiently  long  paths  can  introduce  significant  cumulative  differences  in 
effects across any frequency band or gap.  Only vacuum is essentially non-dispersive. 

- 295 -


The  principal  consequence  of  dispersion  is  that  narrowband  pulse  signals  exhibit  two 
velocities,  the  phase  velocity  vp  of  the  sinusoids  within  the  pulse  envelope,  and  the  group 
velocity vg at which the pulse envelope, energy, and information propagate.  Because energy and 
information  travel  at  the  group  velocity,  it  never  exceeds  the  velocity  of  light  although  phase 
velocity frequently does. 

A  simple  way  to  reveal  this  phenomenon  is  to  superimpose  two  otherwise  identical 
sinusoidal  waves  propagating  at  slightly  different  frequencies,  ω  ±  Δω;  superposition  is  valid 
because Maxwell’s equations are linear.  The corresponding wave numbers are k ± Δk, where Δk 
<< k and Δω << ω.  Such a superposition for two sinusoids propagating in the +z direction is: 

E( t , z)  = Eo cos [(ω + Δω ) t − ( k + Δk ) z ] + Eo cos [(ω − Δω t ) − ( k − Δ k ) z ] 
= E  2 cos (  t 
ω − kz  cos (
) 
kz )

Δω  − Δ

(9.5.18) 

where we used  the  identity cos α + cos β = 2 cos[(α+β)/2] cos[(α−β)/2].  The  first  factor on  the 
right-hand  side  of  (9.5.18)  is  a  sine  wave  propagating  at  the  center  frequency  ω  at  the  phase 
velocity: 

vp  = ω k  

(phase velocity) 

(9.5.19) 

The second factor is the low-frequency, long-wavelength modulation envelope that propagates at 
the group velocity vg = Δω/Δk, which is the slope of the ω(k) dispersion relation: 

vg  = ∂ω ∂ k = ( ∂k ∂ω)−1  

(group velocity) 

(9.5.20) 

Figure  9.5.4(a)  illustrates  the  original  sinusoids  plus  their  superposition  at  two  points  in 
time, and Figure 9.5.4(b) illustrates the corresponding dispersion relation.

Note  that  this  dispersion  relation  has  a  phase  velocity  that  approaches  infinity  at  the  lowest 
frequencies,  which  is  what  happens  in  plasmas  near  the  plasma  frequency,  as  discussed  in  the 
next section. 

Communications  systems  employ  finite-duration  pulses  with  Fourier  components  at  all 
frequencies,  so  if  such  pulses  travel  sufficiently  far  even  the  envelope  with  its  finite  bandwidth 
will  become  distorted.    As  a  result  dispersive media  are  either  avoided  or  compensated  in most 
communications  system  unless  the  bandwidths  are  sufficiently  narrow.    Compensation  is 
possible  because  dispersion  is  a  linear  process  so  inverse  filters  are  readily  designed.    Section 
12.2.2 discusses dispersion further in the context of optical fibers.

9.5.3  Waves in plasmas 

A plasma is a charge-neutral gaseous assembly of atoms or molecules with enough free electrons 
to  significantly  influence  wave  propagation.    Examples  include  the  ionosphere50,  the  sun, 
interiors of  fluorescent bulbs or nuclear  fusion  reactors,  and  even  electrons  in metals or  electron 
pairs in superconductors.  We can characterize fields in plasmas once we know their permittivity 
ε at the frequency of interest. 

To compute the permittivity of a non-magnetized plasma we recall (2.5.8) and (2.5.13): 

D = εE = εo E + P =ε o E + nqd

 

(9.5.21) 

where  q  =  -e  is  the  electron  charge,  d   is  the  mean  field-induced  displacement  of  the  electrons 
from  their  equilibrium  positions,  and  n3  is  the  number  of  electrons  per  cubic  meter.    Although 
positive  ions  are  also  displaced,  these  displacements  are  generally  negligible  in  comparison  to 
those of the electrons because the electron masses me are so much less.  We can take the mass mi 
of  the  ions  into  account  simply  by  replacing me  in  the  equations  by mr,  the  reduced mass  of  the 
electrons, where it can be shown that mr = memi/(me + mi) ≅ me. 

 
To determine ε in (9.5.21) for a collisionless plasma, we merely need to solve Newton’s law 
for  d( t ) , where the force  f  follows from (1.2.1):

50  The  terrestrial  ionosphere  is  a  partially  ionized  layer  at  altitudes  ~50-5000  km,  depending  primarily  upon  solar 
ionization.  Its peak electron density is ~1012 electrons m-3 at 100-300 km during daylight.

The plasma  frequency  is  the natural  frequency of oscillation of a displaced electron or cluster of 
electrons  about  their  equilibrium  location  in  a  neutral  plasma,  and  we  shall  see  that  the 
propagation of waves above and below this frequency is markedly different.

Since vpvg = c2, and since vg  ≤ c, it follows that vp  is alway equal  to or greater than c.   However, 
for ω < ωp we find vp and vg become imaginary because normal wave propagation is replaced by 
another behavior.

Such  an  evanescent wave  decays  exponentially  and  carry  only  reactive  power  and  no  time-
 
average power because of the time orthogonality of E and H.  Reactive power implies that below 
ωp  the  average  energy  stored  is  predominantly  electric,  but  in  this  case  the  stored  energy  is 
actually  dominated  by  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  electrons.    It  is  this  extra  energy  that  allows  the 
permittivity  ε  to  become  negative  below  ωp  although  μo  remains  constant.    The  frequency  ωp 
below which  conversion  from propagation  to evanescence occurs  is called  the cut-off  frequency, 
which is the plasma frequency here. 

Example 9.5C 
What is the plasma frequency fp [Hz]of the ionosphere when ne = 1012 m-3? 

Solution:  fp = ωp/2π = (1012e2/mεo)0.5/2π ≅ 9.0 MHz.

Chapter 10:  Antennas and Radiation 

10.1  Radiation from charges and currents 

10.1.1 

Introduction to antennas and radiation 

An  antenna  is  a  device  that  couples  currents  to  electromagnetic waves  for  purposes  of  radiation 
or  reception.  The  process  by  which  antennas  radiate  can  be  easily  understood  in  terms  of  the 
way  in which  accelerating  charged particles or  time-varying  currents  radiate, which  is discussed 
in Section 10.1.  The expressions for radiated electromagnetic fields derived in Section 10.1.4 are 
simple extensions of those derived in Sections 10.1.2 and 10.1.3 for the fields produced by static 
charges and currents, respectively. 

Using  the  basic  expressions  for  radiation  derived  in  Section  10.1,  simple  short  dipole 
antennas are shown in Section 10.2 to have stable directional properties far from the antenna (the 
antenna  far  field),  and different directional properties  closer  than ~λ/2π  (the  antenna near  field). 
In Section  10.3  these  properties  are  related  to  basic metrics  that  characterize  each  antenna,  such 
as  gain,  effective  area,  and  impedance.    These  metrics  are  then  related  to  the  performance  of 
various  communications  systems.    Antenna  arrays  are  discussed  in  Section  10.4,  followed  by 
aperture and more complicated wire antennas in Sections 11.1 and 11.2, respectively. 

10.1.2  Electric fields around static charges 

One  simple way  to  generate  electromagnetic waves  is  to  vibrate  electric  charges,  creating  time-
varying  current.  The  equation  characterizing  this  radiation  is  very  similar  to  that  characterizing 
the  electric  fields  produced  by  a  single  static  charge, which  is  developed  below.    Section  10.1.3 
extends this result to magnetic fields produced by moving charges. 

Faraday’s and Gauss’s laws for static charges in vacuum are: 

∇ × E 0
= 

∇ • ε o E = ρ 

(10.1.1)

(10.1.2) 

Since the curl of  E  is zero,  E  can be the gradient of any arbitrary scalar function  Φ ( r )  and 
still satisfy (10.1.1).  That is: 

( ) 
( ) 
E r  = −∇Φ  r 

(10.1.3)

where Φ is  the  scalar  electric  potential  and  is  in  units  of Volts.  The  negative  sign  is  consistent 
with  E   pointing  away  from  regions  of  high  potential  and  toward  lower  potentials.    Note  that 
)  0   is  an  identity,  and  that  a  simple  three­
(
(10.1.3)  satisfies  (10.1.1)  because 
∇ × −∇Φ  ≡
dimensional scalar field Φ fully characterizes the three-dimensional vector electric field  E r( ) .  It 

- 301 -


is  therefore  often  easiest  to  find  the  electric  potential  Φ ( r )   before  computing  the  electric  field 
produced by static source charges. 

If the charge q [Coulombs] is spherically symmetric, both Φ and  E  must also be spherically 
symmetric.  The  only  way  a  vector  field  can  be  spherically  symmetric  is  for  it  to  be  directed 
radially, so: 

E = rˆE

 (r )
r 

 

(10.1.4)

where r is the radius from the origin where the charge is centered and Er(r) is the radial field.  We 
can now  relate  E   to q by applying Gauss’s divergence  theorem  (2.4.6)  to  the volume  integral of 
Gauss’s law (10.1.2): 
(cid:120)∫∫∫ V ( 
o  )  (cid:120)∫∫∫ V 
(cid:119)∫∫ A o

(cid:119)∫∫ A o ˆ
ε  n r  
ˆ•  E   (r )  da

Therefore the electric field produced by a charge q at the origin is: 

(10.1.5) 

E r ( ) = rˆE  (r )  = rˆq  4  πε o r 2  = −∇Φ  ⎣⎡Vm  -1
⎤⎦ 
r 

 

(10.1.6)

To  find  the  associated  scalar  potential  Φ  we  integrate  (10.1.6)  using  the  definition  of  the 
gradient operator: 

∂ 
⎛ xˆ 
x + yˆ 
∇Φ ≡ ⎜

∂  ⎤ Φ 
 
θ ∂φ ⎥
⎦ 

(gradient in Cartesian coordinates) 

(10.1.7)

(gradient in spherical coordinates) 

(10.1.8)

Since  the  spherically  symmetric  potential  Φ  (10.1.6)  is  independent  of  θ  and  φ,  it  follows  that 
∂ ∂θ = ∂ ∂φ = 0  and Equation (10.1.8) becomes: 

∇Φ = rˆ∂Φ ∂ r 

(10.1.9) 

This  mathematical  simplification  occurs  only 
in  spherical  coordinates,  not  Cartesian. 
Substitution of (10.1.9)  into (10.1.6), followed by  integration of (10.1.6) with respect to radius r, 
yields: 

Φ ( )r  = ∫ ( q 4
where we define as zero the electric potential Φo contributed by any charge infinitely far away. 

πε o r = q  ( 4πε o  r ) 
 

(10.1.10)

- 302 -


The  solution  for  the  electric  potential Φ  due  to  charge  q  at  some  position  r q   other  than  the 
origin follows from (10.1.10):   
( )Φ  r  = q  ( 4πε o  r − r q  ) = q  ( 4πε o

)   [V]

which can alternatively be written using subscripts p and q to refer to the locations⎯rp  and⎯rq  of 
the  person  (or  observer)  and  the  charge,  respectively,  and  rpq  to  refer  to  the  distance  r p  − r q 
between them. 

If we  replace  the  charge  q with  a  charge  density ρq  in  the  infinitesimal  volume  dv,  then we 
can integrate (10.1.11) over the source region to obtain the total static electric potential produced 
by an arbitrary charge distribution ρq: 
Φ =p  (cid:120)Vq  ⎣⎡ρq  ( 4πε  r

)⎤ dv   [V]
 
⎦ 

(10.1.12)

 

 

This  integration  to find Φp can be performed because Maxwell’s equations are  linear so  that 
superposition applies.  Thus we have a simple way  to compute Φp and  E   for any arbitrary static 
charge  density  distribution  ρq.  This  scalar  Poisson  integral  for  the  potential  function  Φ  is 
similar  to  that found for dynamic charge distributions  in  the next section.   The  integral (10.1.12) 
is also a solution to the Poisson equation: 

2∇ Φ = −ρ εo   

(Poisson equation)  (10.1.13) 

which follows from computing the divergence of Gauss’s law: 

2
} 
{
∇ •  ∇Φ = −E  ⇒ ∇  Φ = −∇ • E = −ρ  ε o 

(10.1.14) 

Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation, ∇2Φ = 0, when ρ = 0. 

10.1.3  Magnetic fields around static currents


Maxwell’s equations governing static magnetic fields in vacuum are: 


∇ × H J=  

∇ • μ o H 0=  

(static Ampere’s law)  (10.1.15) 

(Gauss’s law)  (10.1.16) 

Because  the  divergence  of  H   is  always  zero,  we  can  define  the  magnetic  flux  density  in 
vacuum as being: 

- 303 -


B = μo H = ∇ × A 

(10.1.17) 

where  A   is  defined  as  the magnetic  vector  potential, which  is  a  vector  analog  to Φ.  This  very 
general expression for  B  always satisfies Gauss’s law:  ∇ • ∇ × A ) ≡ 0 .
( 

Substituting (10.1.17) into Ampere’s law (10.1.15) results in: 

) = μ o J 
( 
∇ ×  ∇ × A 

This can be simplified using the vector identity: 

2
) 
(
)
( 
∇ ×  ∇ × A  ≡ ∇  ∇ • A  − ∇  A 

(10.1.18)

(10.1.19) 

where we  note  that  ∇ • A   is  arbitrary  and  does  not  impact  any  of  our  prior  equations;  therefore 
we set it equal to zero.  Then (10.1.18) becomes the vector Poisson equation: 

∇ 2 A = −μ o J 

(vector Poisson equation)  (10.1.20) 

The  three  vector  components  of  (10.1.20)  are  each  scalar  Poisson  equations  identical  to 
(10.1.13)  except  for  the  constant,  so  the  solution  is  nearly  identical  to  (10.1.12)  once  the 
constants have been reconciled; this solution is: 

A p  = (cid:120)Vq  ⎣⎡μo Jq  ( 4πrpq
∫∫∫

)⎤ dv
⎦ 

⎡⎣V s m
 

-1 ⎤⎦ 

 

 

(10.1.21)

Thus  we  have  a  simple  way  to  compute  A   and  therefore  B   for  any  arbitrary  static  current 
distribution  J q . 

10.1.4  Electromagnetic fields produced by dynamic charges


In the static case of Section 10.1.2 it was very helpful to define the potential functions  A  and Φ, 

and the time-dependent Maxwell’s equations for vacuum permit us to do so again: 


∇ × E = −∂ B ∂t  

∇ ×  =H J + ∂ D ∂t  

∇ • E = ρ εo   

∇ • B 0=  

(Faraday’s law)  (10.1.22) 

(Ampere’s law)  (10.1.23) 

(Gauss’s law)  (10.1.24) 

(Gauss’s law)  (10.1.25) 

- 304 -


Although  the  curl  of  E   is  no  longer  zero  so  that  E   no  longer  equals  the  gradient  of  some 
potential Φ, we can satisfy  ∇ • B 0  if we define a vector potential  A  such that:
=

B = ∇ × A = μ o H 

(10.1.26) 

This definition of  A  always satsifies Gauss’s law: 
Faraday’s law yields: 

(
∇ • ∇ × A ) 
≡ 0 .  Substituting  ∇ × A  for  B  in  

(  A ) ∂t 
∇ × E = −∂  ∇ × 

Rearranging terms yields: 

∇ × ( E + ∂ A ∂t ) = 0 

(10.1.27) 

(10.1.28) 

which implies that the quantity  ( E + ∂A ∂t )  can be the gradient of any potential function Φ: 

E + ∂A ∂t = −∇Φ 

(  A ∂  + ∇Φ 
) 
E 
t 
= −  ∂ 

(10.1.29) 

(10.1.30)

Thus dynamic  electric  fields have  two  components—one due  to  the  instantaneous value of Φ(t), 
and one proportional to the time derivative of  A . 

We  can  now  use  the  vector  identity  (10.1.19)  to  simplify  Ampere’s  law  after  (∇ × A ) μo 
replaces  H : 

∇ ×  ∇ × A  = μ o ( J + ∂ D ∂t ) = ∇  ∇ • A  − ∇  A 
2
) 
(
) 
(

(10.1.31) 

By substituting (10.1.30) in (10.1.31) for  D = εo E  and grouping terms we obtain: 

(  A + μ ε  ∂Φ ∂ t ) − μ ε  ∂ 2 A  ∂t 2  = −μ o J 
∇2 A − ∇  ∇ •

(10.1.32)

=A 0   because  specifying  the  curl  of  a  vector  field 
In  the  earlier  static  case  we  let  ∇ •
( B = ∇ × A )   does  not  constrain  its  divergence,  which  can  be  independently  chosen51.  Here  we 
can let: 

∇ • A = −μ  ε  ∂Φ ∂ t 
o o  

(10.1.33)

) 
(
Let  A  = ∇Φ + ∇ × N  ;  then  ∇ × A  = ∇×  ∇ × N 
and  ∇ • A  = ∇  Φ  ,  so  ∇ × A  and  ∇ • A   can  be  chosen 
independently simply by choosing  N  and Φ independently. 

- 305 -


This reduces (10.1.32) to a simple equation by eliminating its second term, yielding:

A  similar  inhomogeneous  wave  equation  relating  the  electric  potential  Φ  to  the  charge

analogous  to  the  vector  version  (10.1.34)  for  A .    These  inhomogeneous  scalar  and  vector 
Helmholtz  equations,  (10.1.34)  and  (10.1.37),  permit  us  to  calculate  the  electric  and  magnetic 
potentials  and  fields  produced  anywhere  in  vacuum  as  a  result  of  arbitrary  source  charges  and 
currents, as explained below. 

The  solutions  to  the  Helmholtz  equations  must  reduce  to:  a)  the  traveling-wave  solutions 
[e.g.,  (2.2.9)]  for  the  wave  equation  [e.g.,  (2.2.7)]  when  the  source  terms  are  zero,  and  b)  the 
static solutions (10.1.10) and (10.1.21) when ∂/∂t = 0.  The essential feature of solutions to wave 
equations is that their separate dependences on space and time must have the same form because 
their second derivatives with respect  to space and  time are  identical within a constant multiplier. 
These  solutions  can  therefore  be  expressed  as  an  arbitrary  function  of  a  single  argument  that 
sums time and space, e.g. (z - ct) or (t - rpq/c).  The solutions must also have the form of the static 
solutions  because  they  reduce  to  them  when  the  source  is  static.    Thus  the  solutions  to  the 
Helmholtz  inhomogeneous  equations  are  the  static  solutions  expressed  in  terms  of  the  argument 
(t - rpq/c):

These solutions are the dynamic scalar Poisson integral and the dynamic vector Poisson integral, 
respectively.   Note  that Φp  and  A p   depend  on  the  state  of  the  sources  at  some  time  in  the  past,  
not  on  their  instantaneous  values.    The  delay  rpq/c  is  the  ratio  of  the  distance  rpq  between  the 
source  and  observer,  and  the  velocity  of  light  c.   That  is,  rpq/c  is  simply  the  propagation  time 
between source and observer. 

10.2  Short dipole antennas 

10.2.1  Radiation from Hertzian dipoles 

Since  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  superposition  applies  and  therefore  the  electromagnetic 
field produced by an arbitrary current distribution is simply the integral of the fields produced by 
each  infinitesimal  element.    Thus  the  electromagnetic  field  response  to  an  infinitesimal  current 
element  is  analogous  to  the  impulse  response  of  a  linear  circuit,  and  comparably  useful  for 
calculating responses to arbitrary stimuli. 

The  simplest  infinitesimal  radiating  element,  called  a  Hertzian  dipole,  is  a  current  element 
of  length d carrying  I(t) amperes.   Conservation of charge  requires charge  reservoirs at each end 
of  the  current  element  containing  ±q(t)  coulombs,  where  I  =  dq/dt,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
10.2.1(a).  The  total  charge  is  zero.    If we  align  the  z  axis with  the  direction  of  the  current  and 
 
assume  the cross-sectional area of  the current element  is Ac [m2],  then  the current density within 
the element is:

where integration over the volume V of the current element yielded a factor of Acd. 

To  obtain  simple  expressions  for  the  radiated  electric  and  magnetic  fields  we  must  now 
switch  to:  1)  time-harmonic  representations  because  radiation  is  frequency  dependent,  and  2) 
polar  coordinates  because  the  symmetry  of  the  radiation  is  polar,  not  cartesian,  as  suggested  in 
Figure  10.2.1(b).  The  time  harmonic  form  of  I(t  -  rpq/c)  is  Ie− jkr pq   and  the  polar  form  of  zˆ   is

These solutions (10.2.5–6) for the Hertzian dipole are fundamental because they permit us to 
calculate  easily  the  radiation  from  arbitrary  current  sources.    It  suffices  to  know  the  source 
current  distribution  because  it  uniquely  determines  the  charge  distribution  via  conservation  of 
charge (2.1.19), and therefore the charge does not radiate independently. 

These  solutions  for  E   and  H   are  polynomials  in  1/jkr,  so  they  have  two  asymptotes—one 
for  large  values  of  kr  and  one  for  small  values.    When  kr  is  very  large  the  lowest  order  terms 
dominate, so kr = 2πr/λ >> 1, or:

Hertzian dipoles preferentially radiate laterally, with zero radiation along their axis.  The electric 
field  strength  Eθ varies  as  sin  θ,  which  yields  a  circle  in  a  polar  plot,  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
.  Since  sin2 45o = 0.5,  the width of  the

Thus  the  radiated  fields  increase  linearly with  Id λ  and  the  total  radiated power  increases as  the

(10.2.13) regardless of the radius r at which we integrate, even in the near field. 

A  simple  expression  for  H   in  the  near  field  of  the  source  is  called  the  Biot-Savart  law;  it

10.2.3  Short dipole antennas 

Antennas transform freely propagating electromagnetic waves into circuit voltages for reception, 
and  also  transform  such  voltages  into  free-space  waves  for  transmission.    They  are  used  for 
wireless  communications,  power  transmission,  or  surveillance  at  wavelengths  ranging  from 
micrometers  (infrared  and  visible  wavelengths)  to  hundreds  of  kilometers.    Their  sophistication 
and  performance  continue  to  increase  as  improved  computational  and  fabrication  methods  are 
developed, although simple structures still dominate today. 

Determining  the  fields  and  currents  associated  with  a  given  antenna  can  be  difficult  using 
traditional  approaches  to  boundary  value  problems  because  many  waves  must  usually  be 
superimposed  in  order  to  match  boundary  conditions,  even  when  well  chosen  orthogonal  wave 
expansions  other  than  plane-waves  are  used.  Fortunately  modern  computer  software  tools  can 
handle  most  antenna  problems.    Here  we  take  a  traditional  alternative  approach  to  antenna 
analysis  that  yields  acceptable  solutions  for  most  common  configurations  by  making  one  key 
assumption—that  the  current  distribution  on  the  antenna  is  known.    Determination  of  antenna 
current distributions is discussed in Sections 11.1–2. 

Arbitrary  antenna  current distributions  can be  approximated by  superimposing  infinitesimal 
Hertzian dipole radiators that have constant current  I  over an infinitesimal length d.  The electric 
far  fields  each  dipole  radiates  are  given  by  (10.2.8),  and  the  total  radiated  field  E   is  simply  the 
sum of  these differential contributions.   Superposition of  these fields  is valid because Maxwell’s 
equations are linear.  H  can then be readily found using Faraday’s law or direct integration.  This 
is  the approach  taken here;  the  far  fields of  the short dipole antenna are  found by  integrating  the 
contributions from each  infinitesimal element of  that dipole.   From these fields  the antenna gain, 
effective  area,  and  circuit  properties  can  then  be  found,  as  discussed  in  Section  10.3.    Many 
practical antennas, such as those used in many cars for the ~1-MHz Amplitude-Modulated (AM) 
band,  are  approximately  short-dipole  antennas  with  lengths  less  than  a  few  percent  of  the 
associated  wavelength  λ.  Their  simple  behavior  provides  an  easy  introduction  to  antenna 
analysis.

Consider  the  short-dipole  antenna  illustrated  in  Figure  10.2.3.    It  has  length  d  <<  λ  and  is 
 
driven  by  a  current  source with  Io   amperes  at  angular  frequency  ω  [radians/second].  Complex 
notation is used here for simplicity because antenna characteristics are frequency-dependent.  As 
discussed later, the wires, or “feed-lines”, providing current to the dipole do not alter the dipole’s 
radiated fields because those wires are perpendicular to the antenna fields and also do not radiate.

4π steradians.  G(θ,φ) is often called “gain over isotropic” where:

A  related  quantity  is  antenna  directivity  D(θ,φ),  which  is  normalized  to  the  total  power 
radiated PT rather than to the power PA available at the antenna terminals:

The  transmitted  power  is  less  than  the  available  power  if  the  antenna  is  mismatched  or  lossy.

(10.3.3)

Equation  (10.3.3)  says  that  if  the  directivity  or  gain  is  large  in  one  direction,  it  must  be 
correspondingly diminished elsewhere, as suggested in Figure 10.2.4, where the pattern is plotted 
relative to an isotropic radiator and exhibits its “main lobe” in the direction θ = 90°.  This pattern 
is  independent  of  φ.  The  half-power  antenna  beamwidth  in  the  θ direction  is  the  angle  θB 
between  two  directions where  the  radiated  power  is  half  that  radiated  at  the  peak,  as  illustrated. 
Thus  (10.3.3)  and  the  figure  also  suggest  that  high  directivity  antennas  have  narrower 
beamwidths θB, or are more “directive”. 

The  ratio  PT/PA  is  that  fraction  of  the  power  available  at  the  antenna  terminals  (PA)  that  is 
radiated; it is defined as the radiation efficiency ηR:

(10.3.5)

The radiation efficiency is usually near unity because the resistive losses and the reflective losses 
due  to  impedance mismatches  are  small  in most  systems.   Typical  exceptions  to  the  rule ηR  ≅ 1 
include  most  short  dipoles  and  antennas  that  are  used  over  bandwidths  much  greater  than  an 
octave; their impedances are difficult to match. 

The directivity of a short dipole antenna is given by substituting (10.2.27) and (10.2.28) into

10.3.2  Circuit properties of antennas 

Antennas  connect  to  electrical  circuits,  and  therefore  it  is  important  to  understand  the  circuit 
properties  of  antennas.  The  linearity  of  Maxwell’s  equations  applies  to  antennas,  so  they  can 
therefore  be  modeled  by  a  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  consisting  of  a  Thevenin  equivalent 
impedance ZA in series with a Thevenin voltage source VTh.  This section evaluates the Thevenin 
equivalent impedance ZA, and Section 10.3.3 evaluates VTh.  The frequency dependence of  these 
circuit  equivalents  usually  does  not  map  neatly  into  that  of  inductors,  capacitors,  and  resistors, 
and so we simply use complex notation and a generalized ZA(ω) instead, where: 

(
) 
(
)
(
ZA  ω = R  ω + jX

)
ω 

 

(10.3.8) 

R(ω)  is  the  resistive  part  of  the  impedance  corresponding  to  the  total  power  dissipated  and 
radiated, and X(ω) is the reactive part, corresponding to near-field energy storage. 

To  find ZA(ω) we  can  use  the  integral  form  of  Poynting’s  theorem  (2.7.23)  for  a  volume V 
bounded by surface area A to relate the terminal voltage V and current I to the near and far fields 
of any antenna:

For example,  the  short dipole antenna  in Figure 10.2.3  is  shown  surrounded by a  surface area A 
= A' + A" + A''', where A' is the cross-sectional area of the TEM feed line, A" is the outer surface 
of the coaxial feed line, and A''' is far from the antenna and intercepts only radiated fields.

These  three  contributions  (A',  A",  and  A''')  to  the  surface  integral  on  the  left-hand  side  of

Equation  (10.3.10)  simply  expresses  in  two  different  ways  the  power  flowing  away  from  the 
antenna  through  the  TEM  feed  line;  the  negative  sign  results  because  Poynting’s  vector  here  is 
oriented  outward  and  the  current  flow  I  is  oriented  inward.  Because  no  power  flows 
perpendicular to the conducting sheath of the feed line, we have: 
∫∫  ( E H×

The  third  integral over  the  far  fields A'''  captures  the  total power  radiated by  the  antenna, which

X(ω) is the antenna reactance, and the integral in (10.3.14) is the dissipative component Rd(ω) of 
antenna  resistance  R(ω).  If  the  average  near-field magnetic  energy  storage  exceeds  the  electric 
energy  storage,  then  the  antenna  reactance  X  is  positive  and  inductive;  if  the  energy  stored  is 
predominantly electric, then X is negative and capacitive.  In practice the real part of the jω term 
in (10.3.14) is usually zero, as is the imaginary part of the  E J ∗  term in (10.3.15), but there can
•
be  exceptions.  The  R  and  X  of  antennas  are  seldom  computed  analytically,  but  are  usually 
determined by experiment or computational tools.

The  radiation  resistance  Rr  of  short  dipole  antennas  can  be  estimated  using  (10.3.12)  and 
(10.2.28); the dissipative resistance Rd in short wires given by (10.3.14) is usually negligible:

(radiation resistance, short dipole)  (10.3.16)

The effective  length deff of a short dipole  is approximately half  its physical  length  [see  (10.2.25) 
and Figure 10.2.3]. 

The  reactance X  of  a  short  dipole  antenna  can  be  found  using  (10.3.15);  it  results  primarily 
from  the  energy  stored  in  the  near  fields.    The  near-field  energy  for  short  or Hertzian  dipoles  is 
predominantly  electric,  since  the  near-field  E r∝ −3   (10.2.15)  while  the  near-field  H r∝ −2 
(10.2.16), and r→ 0.  Since the electric term of (10.3.15) is much greater than the magnetic term, 
X is negative.

A certain matched antenna  radiates one watt  (Pr) when driven with voltage Vo = 10 volts.  What 
is the antenna radiation resistance Rr? 

Solution:  Pr  =  Vo

10.3.3  Receiving properties of antennas 

Because  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear  in  field  strength,  antennas  have  equivalent  circuits 
consisting  of  a  Thevenin  equivalent  impedance  ZA(ω),  given  by  (10.3.13),  in  series  with  a 
Thevenin  voltage  source  VTh(ω)  that  we  can  now  evaluate.    Non-zero  voltages  appear  when 
antennas  receive  signals,  where  these  voltages  depend  upon  the  direction,  polarization,  and 
strength of the intercepted waves. 

Figure  10.3.1(a)  illustrates  the  Thevenin  equivalent  circuit  for  any  antenna,  and  Figure 
10.3.1(b)  illustrates  the  electric  fields  and  equipotentials  associated  with  a  short  dipole  antenna 
intercepting a uniform plane wave polarized parallel  to  the dipole axis.   When  the wavelength λ 
greatly  exceeds  d  and  other  local  dimensions  of  interest,  i.e.  λ → ∞,  then Maxwell’s  equations 
become: 

( π λ c  ) B  → 0
∇ × E = − j 2

 λ → ∞

Figure 10.3.1  Thevenin voltage induced on a short dipole antenna. 
 

Far from the dipole the field lines  E  in Figure 10.3.1(b) are those of the quasistatic incident 
plane wave, i.e., uniform and parallel to the dipole.  Close to the conducting dipole  E  is distorted 
to match  the  boundary  conditions:  1)  E(cid:38)  = 0 ,  and  2)  each  half  of  the  dipole  is  an  equipotential, 
intercepting  only  one  equipotential  line  (boldface,  dashed).    If  the  wires  comprising  the  short 
dipole  are  very  thin,  the  effects  of  each  wire  on  the  other  are  negligible.    Under  these 
assumptions  symmetry  dictates  the  form  for  three  of  the  equipotentials  in  Figure  10.3.1—the 
equipotentials  through  the  center  of  the  dipole  and  through  each  of  its  two  halves  are  straight 
lines.    The  other  equipotentials  sketched  with  dashed  lines  curve  around  the  conductors.    The 
field  lines  E   are  sketched with  solid  lines  locally  perpendicular  to  the  equipotentials.  The  field 
lines  terminate  at  charges  on  the  surface  of  the  conductors  and  possibly  at  infinity,  as  governed 
s .

Figures  10.3.1(b)  and  (c)  suggest  why  the  open-circuit  voltage  VTh  of  the  short  dipole 
antenna equals the potential difference between the centers of the two halves of this ideal dipole: 

VTh  ≡ −E • deff

The effective  length of  the dipole,  deff  ,  is defined by  (10.3.19), and  is  the same as  the effective 
length defined  in  terms of  the current distribution (10.2.25) for  infinitesimally  thin straight wires 
of  length  d  <<  λ.  Generally  deff  ≅ d
 
2
 
,  which  is  the  distance  between  the  centers  of  the  two 
conductors.  Each  conductor  is  essentially  sampling  the  electrostatic  potential  in  its  vicinity  and 
conveying  that  to  the  antenna  terminals.    The  orientation  of  deff   is  that  of  the  dipole  current 
flow that would be driven by external sources having the defined terminal polarity. 

The maximum power an antenna can deliver to an external circuit of impedance ZL is easily 
computed  once  the  antenna  equivalent  circuit  is  known.    To  maximize  this  transfer  it  is  first 
 
necessary  to  add  an  external  load  reactance,  -jXL,  in  series  to  cancel  the  antenna  reactance  +jX 
(X  is negative  for  a  short dipole  antenna because  it  is  capacitive).   Then  the  resistive part of  the 
load RL must match that of the antenna, i.e., RL = Rr.  Maximum power transfer occurs when the

impedances match  so  incident waves are not  reflected.    In  this conjugate-match case  (ZL = ZA
the antenna Thevenin voltage VTh is divided across the two resistors Rr and RL so that the voltage 
across RL is VTh/2 and the power received by the short dipole antenna is:

G(θ,φ)  =  D(θ,φ)  =  1.5  sin2θ  is  the  antenna  gain  of  a  lossless  short-dipole  antenna  (10.3.7),  and 
A(θ,φ)  is  the  antenna  effective  area  as  defined  by  the  equation  Pr  ≡ I(θ,φ)  A(θ,φ)  [W]  for  the

a  square  roughly λ/3 on a  side,  independent of antenna  length.    A  small wire  structure  (<< λ/3)

requires  a  high-Q  resonance,  large  field  strengths,  and  high  losses.    In  practice,  short-dipole 
antennas generally have a reactive mismatch that reduces their effective area below optimum. 

10.3.4  Generalized relation between antenna gain and effective area 

Section  10.3.3  proved  for  a  short-dipole  antenna  the  basic  relation  (10.3.23)  between  antenna 
gain G(θ,φ) and antenna effective area A(θ,φ): 

θ φ  = λ2 
G(θ φ 
A ,(
)  4π
,  ) 
This  relation can be proven  for any arbitrary antenna provided all media  in and near  the antenna 
are  reciprocal media,  i.e.,  their  complex  permittivity,  permeability,  and  conductivity matrices  ε, 
μ, and σ are all symmetric: 

(10.3.24) 

ε = ε t ,  μ = μ t ,  σ = σ t 

(10.3.25) 

where we define  the  transpose operator  t such  that At
ij = Aji.  Non-reciprocal media are  rare, but 
include magnetized  plasmas  and magnetized  ferrites;  they  are  not  discussed  in  this  text.   Media 
characterized by matrices are discussed in Section 9.5.1. 

To prove (10.3.24) we characterize a general linear 2-port network by its impedance matrix: 

⎡Z11  Z12 ⎤
Z = ⎢ 
⎥  
⎣Z21  Z22 ⎦

V ZI
= 

(impedance matrix)  (10.3.26)

(10.3.27)

where  V  and  I  are  the  two-element voltage and current vectors [V1, V2] and [I1, I2], and Vi and 
Ii are the voltage and current at terminal pair i.  This matrix  Z  does not depend on the network to 
t 
which the 2-port is connected.  If the 2-port system is a reciprocal network, then  Z Z , so Z12 =
= 
Z21. 

Since  Maxwell’s  equations  are  linear,  V  is  linearly  related  to  I,  and  we  can  define  an 
antenna  impedance  Z11  consisting  of  a  real  part  (10.3.14),  typically  dominated  by  the  radiation 
resistance Rr  (10.3.12),  and  a  reactive part  jX  (10.3.15).  Thus  Z11 = R1 +  jX1, where R1  equals 
the  sum  of  the  dissipative  resistance Rd1  and  the  radiation  resistance Rr1.  For most  antennas Rd 
<< Rr. 

Figure 10.3.2  illustrates an unknown reciprocal antenna (1)  that communicates with a short-
dipole  test  antenna  (2)  that  is  aimed  at  antenna  (1).    Because  the  relations  between  the  voltages 
and  currents  at  the  terminals  are  determined  by  electromagnetic  waves  governed  by  the  linear 
Maxwell  equations,  the  two  antennas  constitute  a  two-port  network  governed  by  (10.3.26)  and

(10.3.27)  and  the  complex  impedance matrix  Z .  Complex  notation  is  appropriate  here  because 
antennas  are  frequency  dependent.    This  impedance  representation  easily  introduces  the 
reciprocity  constraint  to  the  relation  between  G(θ,φ)  and  A(θ,φ).  We  assume  each  antenna  is 
matched to its load ZL = Rr – jX so as to maximize power transfer.

Therefore  if  reciprocity  applies,  so  that  |Z12|2  =  |Z21|2,  then  (10.3.23)  for  a  short  dipole  and 
substitution  of  (10.3.32)  into  (10.3.31)  proves  that  all  reciprocal  antennas  obey  the  same  A/G

We  now  can  combine  the  transmitting  and  receiving  properties  of  antennas  to  yield  the  power 
that can be  transmitted from one place  to another.   For example,  the  intensity I(θ,φ) at distance r 
that results from transmitting Pt watts from an antenna with gain Gt(θ,φ)  is:

10.4  Antenna arrays 

10.4.1  Two-dipole arrays 

Although  some  communications  services  such  as  mobile  phones  use  nearly  omnidirectional 
electric  or  magnetic  dipole  antennas  (short-dipole  and  loop  antennas),  most  fixed  services  such 
as point-to-point, broadcast, and satellite services benefit  from  larger antenna gains.   Also, some 
applications  require  rapid  steering  of  the  antenna  beam  from  one  point  to  another,  or  even  the 
ability to observe or transmit in multiple narrow directions simultaneously.  Antenna arrays with 
two  or  more  dipoles  can  support  all  of  these  needs.    Arrays  of  other  types  of  antennas  can 
similarly boost performance. 

Since the effective area of an antenna, A(θ,φ), is simply related by (10.3.36) to antenna gain 
G(θ,φ),  the  gain  of  a  dipole  array  fully  characterizes  its  behavior,  which  is  determined  by  the 
array current distribution.  Sometimes some of the dipoles are simply mirrored images of others. 

In  every  case  the  total  radiated  field  is  simply  the  superposition  of  the  fields  radiated  by 
each  contributing  dipole  in  proportion  to  its  strength,  and  delayed  in  proportion  to  its  distance 
from  the observer.   For  two-dipole arrays,  the differential path  length  to  the  receiver  can  lead  to 
reinforcement if the two sinusoidal waves are in phase, cancellation if they are 180o out of phase 
and equal, and intermediate strength otherwise. 

- 324 -


It  is  convenient  to  represent  the  signals  as  phasors  since  the  patterns  are  frequency 
dependent,  so  the  total  observed  electric  field  E = ∑ i E i  , where  E i   is  the  observed  contribution 
from  short-dipole  i,  including  its  associated  phase  lag  of  γi  radians  due  to  distance  traveled. 
Consider  first  the  two-dipole  array  in  Figure  10.4.1(a),  where  the  dipoles  are  z-axis  oriented, 
parallel,  fed  in  phase,  and  spaced  distance  L  apart  laterally  in  the  y  direction.    Any  observer  in 
the  x-z  plane  separating  the  dipoles  receives  equal  in-phase  contributions  from  each  dipole, 
thereby  doubling  the  observed  far-field  E ff   and  quadrupling  the  power  intensity  P  [Wm-2] 
radiated in that direction θ relative to what would be transmitted by a single dipole.

Figure 10.4.1  Two-dipole array. 
  

The  radiated  power  P(r,φ)  in  Figure  10.4.1  depends  on  the  differential  phase  lag  γ  between 
the contributions  from  the  two antennas.   When  the  two dipoles are excited equally  ( I1  = I 2  = I ) 
and  are  spaced  L  =  λ/2  apart,  the  two  rays  add  in  phase  everywhere  in  the  x-z  plane 
perpendicular  to  the  array  axis,  but  are  λ/2  (180o)  out  of  phase  and  cancel  along  the  array  (y) 
axis.  The resulting G(φ)  is sketched  in Figure 10.4.2(a) for  the x-y plane.   If L = λ as  illustrated 
in  Figure  10.4.2(b),  then  the  two  rays  add  in  phase  along  both  the  x-z  plane  and  the  y  axis,  but 
cancel  in  the x-y plane  at φnull = 30o where  the differential delay between  the  two  rays  is λ/2, as 
suggested by the right triangle in the figure. 

Figure 10.4.2(c)  illustrates how  a non-symmetric pattern  can be  synthesized by  exciting  the 
two dipoles out of phase.  In  this  case  the  lower dipole  leads  the upper dipole by 90 degrees,  so 
that the total phase difference between the two rays propagating in the negative y direction is 180 
degrees,  producing  cancellation;  this  phase  difference  is  zero  degrees  for  radiation  in  the  +y 
direction, so the two rays add.  Along the ±x axis the two rays are 90 degrees out of phase so the 
total  E  is  2 greater  than  from  a  single  dipole,  and  the  intensity  is  doubled.    When  the  two 
phasors  are  in  phase  the  total  E  is  doubled  and  the  radiated  intensity  is  4  times  that  of  a  single 
dipole; thus the intensity radiated along the ±x axis is half that radiated along the +y axis.  Figure 
10.4.2(d)  illustrates  how  a  null-free  pattern  can  be  synthesized  with  non-equal  excitation  of  the 
two dipoles.  In this case the two dipoles are driven in phase so that the radiated phase difference 
is  180  degrees  along  the  ±y  axis  due  to  the  λ/2  separation  of  the  dipoles.   Nulls  are  avoided  by 

- 325 -


exciting either dipole with a current that is ~40 percent of the other so that the ratio of maximum 
gain to minimum gain is ~[(1 + 0.4)/(1 - 0.4)]2 = 5.44, and the pattern is vaguely rectangular.

Example 10.4A 
If the two dipoles of Figure 10.4.1 are fed in phase and their separation is L = 2λ, at what angles 
φ in the x-y plane are there nulls and peaks in the gain G(φ)?  Are these peaks equal?  Repeat this 
analysis for L = λ/4, assuming the voltage driving the dipole at y > 0 has a 90° phase lag relative 
to the other dipole. 

Solution:	 Referring  to  Figure  10.4.1,  there  are  nulls  when  the  phase  difference  γ  between  the 
two  rays  arriving  at  the  receiver  is  π  or  3π,  or  equivalently,  D  =  λ/2  or  3λ/2, 
sin-1(D/L)  =

±sin-1[(λ/2)/2λ]  =  ±  sin-1(0.25)  ≅ ±14°,  and  φ  =  ±  sin-1(0.75)  ≅ ±49°.  There  are  also 
nulls, by  symmetry, at angles 180° away, or at φ ≅ ±194° and ±229°.  There are gain 
peaks when the two rays are in phase (φ = 0° and 180°) and when they differ in phase 
by 2π or 4π, which happens when φ = ± sin-1(λ/2λ) = ±30° and φ = ±210°, or when φ 
= ±90°, respectively.  The gain peaks are equal because they all correspond to the two 
rays adding coherently with the same magnitudes.   When L = λ/4 the  two rays add in 
phase at φ = 90° along the +y axis because in that direction the phase lag balances the 
90°  delay  suffered  by  the  ray  from  the  dipole  on  the  -y  axis.   At  φ  =  270°  these  two 
90-degree  delays  add  rather  than  cancel,  so  the  two  rays  cancel  in  that  direction, 
producing a perfect null. 

10.4.2  Array antennas with mirrors 

One of the simplest ways to boost the gain of a short dipole antenna is to place a mirror behind it 
to  as  to  reinforce  the  radiation  in  the  desired  forward  direction  and  cancel  it  behind.    Figure 
10.4.3  illustrates how a short current element I placed near a perfectly conducting planar surface 
will  behave  as  if  the  mirror  were  replaced  by  an  image  current  an  equal  distance  behind  the 
mirror  and  pointed  in  the  opposite  direction  parallel  to  the  mirror  but  in  the  same  direction 
normal to the mirror.  The fields in front of the mirror are identical with and without the mirror if 
it is sufficiently large.  Behind the mirror the fields approach zero, of course.  Image currents and 
charges were discussed in Section 4.2. 

Figure 10.4.3(a)  illustrates  a  common way  to boost  the  forward gain of  a dipole  antenna by 
placing it λ/4 in front of a planar mirror and parallel to it.

Figure 10.4.3  Half-wave dipole antenna λ/4 in front of a mirror. 
 

The image current is 180 degrees out of phase, so the λ/2 delay suffered by the image ray brings 
it  into phase coherence with  the direct  ray, effectively doubling  the  far  field Eff and quadrupling 
the  intensity  and  gain  Go  relative  to  the  absence  of  the  mirror.    In  all  directions  more  nearly 
parallel  to  the  mirror  the  source  and  image  are  more  nearly  out  of  phase,  so  the  gain  in  those 
directions  is diminished  relative  to  the absence of  the mirror.   The  resulting antenna gain G(θ,φ) 
is sketched in Figure 10.4.3(b), and has no backlobes.

This expression  reveals  that  the antenna pattern has no sidelobes and  is pinched somewhat more 
in  the  θ  direction  than  in  the  β  direction  (these  directions  are  not  orthogonal).    An  on-axis 
observer will receive a z-polarized signal. 

Mirrors  can  also  be  parabolic  and  focus  energy  at  infinity,  as  discussed  further  in  Section 
11.1.  The  sidelobe-free  properties  of  this  dipole-plus-mirror  make  it  a  good  antenna  feed  for 
radiating energy toward much larger parabolic reflectors. 

Example 10.4B 
Automobile  antennas  often  are  thin  metal  rods  ~1-meter  long  positioned  perpendicular  to  an 
approximately  flat  metal  surface  on  the  car;  the  rod  and  flat  surface  are  electrically  insulated 
from  each  other.    The  rod  is  commonly  fed  by  a  coaxial  cable,  the  center  conductor  being 
attached  to  the  base  of  the  rod  and  the  sheath  being  attached  to  the  adjacent  car  body. 
Approximately  what  is  the  radiation  resistance  and  pattern  in  the  1-MHz  radio  broadcast  band, 
assuming the flat plate is infinite? 

Solution:  	 Figure 4.2.3 shows how  the  image of a current flowing perpendicular  to a conducting 
plane flows in the same direction as the original current, so any current flowing in the 
rod  has  an  image  current  that  effectively  doubles  the  length  of  this  antenna.    The 
wavelength  at  1  MHz  is  ~300  meters,  much  longer  than  the  antenna,  so  the  short-
dipole  approximation  applies  and  the  current  distribution  on  the  rod  and  its  image 
resembles  that  of  Figure  10.2.3;  thus  deff  ≅  1  meter  and  the  pattern  above  the  metal 
plane  is  the  top half of  that  illustrated  in Figure 10.2.4.   The  radiation  resistance of  a 
normal short dipole antenna (10.3.16) is Rr = 2PT/|Io|2 = 2ηoπ(deff/λ)2/3 = 0.0088 ohms 
for deff = 1 meter.  Here, however, the total power radiated PT is half that radiated by a 
short  dipole  of  length  2  meters  because  there  is  no  power  radiated  below  the 
conducting  plane,  so Rr  =  0.0044  ohms.   The  finite  size  of  an  automobile  effectively 
warps  and  shortens  both  the  image  current  and  the  effective  length  of  the  dipole, 
although  the antenna pattern  for a straight current  is always dipolar above  the ground 
plane. 

- 328 -


10.4.3  Element and array factors 

The  power  radiated  by  dipole  arrays  depends  on  the  directional  characteristics  of  the  individual 
dipole  antennas  as well  as  on  their  spacing  relative  to wavelength λ.  For  example,  (10.4.3)  can 
be generalized to N identically oriented but independently positioned and excited dipoles:

Figure  10.4.4  illustrates  a  case where  both  the  element  and  array  factors  are  important; L = 
λ/2 here and the dipoles are fed 180o out of phase.  In this case the out-of-phase signals from the 
two dipoles cancel everywhere in  the x-y plane and add  in phase along the z axis, corresponding 
to  the  array  factor plotted  in Figure 10.4.4(b)  for  the y-z plane.   Note  that when θ = 60o  the  two

10.4.4  Uniform dipole arrays 

Uniform  dipole  arrays  consist  of  N  identical  dipole  antennas  equally  spaced  in  a  straight  line.

The  z  axis  is  defined  by  the  orientation  of  the  dipoles, which  are  all  parallel  to  it.   The  simplest 
arrangement  of  the  dipoles  is  along  that  same  z  axis,  as  in  Figure  10.4.5,  although  (10.4.6) 
applies  equally  well  if  the  dipoles  are  spaced  in  any  arbitrary  direction.    Figure  10.4.1(a) 
illustrates  the  alternate  case  where  two  dipoles  are  spaced  along  the  y  axis,  and  Figure  10.4.2

(10.4.11)

If  the  elements  are  excited  in  phase  (ψ  =  0),  then  the maximum  gain  is  broadside with  θ = 
900, because only  in  that direction do  all N  rays  add  in perfect phase.    In  this  case  the  first nulls 
θfirst  null  bounding  the main  beam  occur when  the  numerator  of  (10.4.11)  is  zero, which  happens 
when:

(10.4.12) 

Note  that  the  factor  ka  =  2πa/λ  is  in  units  of  radians,  and  therefore  cosθfirst  null  =  ±λ/Na.    If 
θfirst null  ≡ π/2 ± θfn, where θfn is the null angle measured from the x-y plane rather than from the z 
axis, then we have cosθfirst null = sinθfn  ≅ θfn and: 

θ ≅ ±λ Na [  radians ]

The  following  simple  geometric  argument  yields  the  same  answer.    Figure  10.4.5(b)  shows 
that  the  first  null  of  this  6-dipole  array  occurs  when  the  rays  from  the  first  and  fourth  dipole 
element  cancel,  for  then  the  rays  from  the  second  and  fifth,  and  the  third  and  sixth  will  also 
cancel.  This  total  cancellation  occurs  when  the  delay  between  the  first  and  fourth  ray  is  λ/2, 
which corresponds to the angle θfn = ±sin-1[(λ/2)/(aN/2)] ≅ ±λ/aN.

Figure 10.4.6  Antenna pattern for N-element linear dipole array.
 

 
The  angle  θfn  between  the  beam  axis  and  the  first  null  is  approximately  the  half-power 
beamwidth  θB  of  an N-element  antenna  array.   The  antenna  gain G(θ)  associated with  (10.4.11) 
for  N  =  6,  ψ =  0,  and  a  =  λ/2  is  sketched  in  Figure  10.4.6(a),  together  with  the  squares  of  the 

- 332 -


array  factor  [from  (10.4.10)] and element  factor  [from  (10.4.6)].    In  this case θfn = ±sin-1(2/N) ≅ 
±2/N radians ≅ θB. 

If ψ ≠ 0 so that the excitation phase varies linearly across the array, then the main beam and 
the  rest of  the pattern  is “squinted” or “scanned”  to one side by angle α.  Since a phase delay of 
ψ  is  equivalent  to  a  path  delay  of  δ,  where  ψ  =  kδ,  and  since  the  distance  between  adjacent 
dipoles  is  a,  it  follows  that  adjacent  rays  for  a  scanned beam will be  in phase  at  angle θ = π/2 + 
sin-1(δ/a) = π/2 + α, where: 

α = sin −1 ( δ a ) = sin −1 (ψλ  2πa )	  

(scan angle)  (10.4.14) 

as sketched in Figure 10.4.6(b) for the case ψ = 2 radians, a = λ/2, and α ≅ 40o . 

Note that larger element separations a can produce multiple main lobes separated by smaller 
ones.  Additional  main  lobes  appear  when  the  argument  (ψ  +  ka  cosθ)/2  in  the  denominator  of 
(10.4.11) is an integral multiple of π so that the denominator is zero; the numerator is zero at the 
same  angles,  so  the  ratio  is  finite  although  large.    To  preclude  multiple  main  lobes  the  spacing 
should be a < λ, or even a < λ/2 if the array is scanned. 

Example 10.4D 
A uniform row of 100 x-oriented dipole antennas lies along the z axis with inter-dipole spacing a 
=  2λ.  At  what  angles  θ  in  the  y-z  plane  is  the  gain  maximum?    See  Figure  10.4.5  for  the 
geometry, but note that the dipoles for our problem are x-oriented rather than z-oriented.  What is 
the  angle  Δ  between  the  two  nulls  adjacent  to  θ ≅ π/2?  What  is  the  gain  difference  ΔG(dB) 
between  the  main  lobe  at  θ  =  π/2  and  its  immediately  adjacent  sidelobes?    What  difference  in 
excitation phase ψ between adjacent dipoles is required to scan these main lobes 10° to one side? 

Solution:	 The  gain  is  maximum  when  the  rays  from  adjacent  dipoles  add  in  phase,  and 
therefore  all  rays  add  in  phase.    This  occurs  at  θ =  0,  ± π 2 ,  and  ± sin −1 ( λ a ) ≅   30° 
[see  Figure  10.4.5(b)  for  the  approximate  geometry, where we want  a  phase  lag  of  λ 
to  achieve  a  gain  maximum].    The  nulls  nearest  θ = π 2  occur  at  that  θfn  when  the 
rays  from  the  first  and  51st  dipoles  first  cancel  [see  text  after  (10.4.13)],  or  when

The  array  factors  for  this  problem  and  Figure  10.4.5(a)  are  the  same,  so  (10.4.10)

10.4.5  Phasor addition in array antennas 

Phasor  addition  can  be  a  useful  tool  for  analyzing  antennas.   Consider  the  linear  dipole  array  of 
Figure  10.4.5,  which  consists  of  N  identical  z-oriented  dipole  antennas  spaced  at  distance  a 
equally along  the z-axis.  In direction θ from  the z axis  the array factor is the sum of the phasors 
emitted  from  each  dipole.    Figure  10.4.6(a)  shows  this  sum A  for  the  x-y  plane  (θ  =  90°) when 
the  dipoles  are  all  excited  in  phase  and  N  =  8.  This  yields  the maximum  possible  gain  for  this 
antenna.  As θ departs from 90° (broadside radiation) the phasors each rotate differently and add 
to  form  a  progressively  smaller  sum B.  When  the  total  phasor B  corresponds  to  Δφ  =  5-degree 
lag for each successive contribution, then θ =  cos−1 (  5  λ ) .  Figure 10.4.6(b, c, and d) show the
360  a 
sum  B  when  Δφ  is  45°,  72°,  and  90°,  respectively.  The  antenna  gain  is  proportional  to  |B|2. 
Figures (b) and (d) correspond to radiation angles θ that yield nulls in the pattern (|B| = 0), while 
(c)  is  near  a  local  maximum  in  the  antenna  pattern.    Because  |C|  is  ~0.2|A|,  the  gain  of  this 
sidelobe  is  ~0.04  times  the  maximum  gain  (|C|2  ≅  0.04|A|2),  or  ~14  dB  weaker.54   The  spatial 
angles θ corresponding to (a) - (d) depend on the inter-dipole distance 'a'. 

If a = 2λ,  then angles θ  from  the z axis  that correspond  to phasor A  in Figure 10.4.7  (a) are 
0°,  60°,  90°,  120°,  and  180°;  the  peaks  at  0  and  180°  fall  on  the  null  of  the  element  factor  and 
can be ignored.  The angle from the array axis is θ, and 'a' is the element spacing, as illustrated in 
Figure  10.4.5.  The  angles  θ  =  0°  and  180°  correspond  to  cos-1  (2λ/2λ),  while  θ  =  60°  and  θ  = 
120°  correspond  to  cos-1(λ/2λ),  and  θ  =  90°  corresponds  to  cos-1  (0/2λ);  the  numerator  in  the 
argument  of  cos-1  is  the  lag  distance  in  direction  θ,  and  the  denominator  is  the  element  spacing 
'a'.    Thus  this  antenna  has  three  equal  peaks  in  gain:  θ  =  60,  90,  and  120°,  together  with 
numerous smaller sidelobes between those peaks. 

54 dB ≡ 10 log10N, so N = 0.04 corresponds to ~-14 dB.

Four  small  sidelobes  occur  between  the  adjacent  peaks  at  60°,  90°,  and  120°.  The  first 
sidelobe  occurs  in  each  case  for  φ ≅  70°  as  illustrated  in  Figure  10.4.2(c),  i.e.,  approximately 
half-way between  the nulls  at φ = 45° [Figure 10.4.2(b)]  and φ = 90°  [Figure 10.4.2(d)],  and  the 
second  sidelobe  occurs  for  φ ≅  135°,  between  the  nulls  for  φ  =  90°  [Figure  10.4.2(d)]  and  φ  = 
180° (not  illustrated).  Consider, for example,  the broadside main  lobe at θ = 90°; for  this case φ 
= 0°.  As θ decreases from 90° toward zero, φ increases toward 45°, where the first null occurs as 
shown  in  (b);  the  corresponding  θnull  =  cos-1[(φλ/360)/2λ]  =  86.4°.  The  denominator  2λ  in  the 
argument is again the inter-element spacing.  The first sidelobe occurs when φ ≅ 72° as shown in 
(c),  and  θ ≅  cos-1[(φλ/360)/2λ]  =  84.4°.  The  next  null  occurs  at  φ  =  90°  as  shown  in  (d),  and 
θnull  =  cos-1[(φλ/360)/2λ]  =  82.8°.  The  second  sidelobe  occurs  for  φ ≅  135°,  followed  by  a  null 
when  φ  =  180°.  The  third  and  fourth  sidelobes  occur  for  φ ≅  225°  and  290°  as  the  phasor 
patterns  repeat  in  reverse  sequence:  (d)  is  followed by  (c)  and  then  (b)  and  (a)  as θ  continues  to 
decline  toward  the  second  main  lobe  at  θ  =  60°.  The  entire  gain  pattern  thus  has  three  major 
peaks at 60, 90, and 120°, typically separated by four smaller sidelobes intervening between each 
major pair, and also grouped near θ = 0° and 180°. 

Example 10.4E 
What  is  the  gain GS  of  the  first  sidelobe  of  an  n-element  linear  dipole  array  relative  to  the main 
lobe Go as n → ∞? 

Solution:  Referring  to  Figure  10.4.7(c),  we  see  that  as  n→∞  the  first  sidelobe  has  an  electric 
n
field EffS that is the diameter of the circle formed by the n phasors when  ∑ i 1| E  |  = 
i 
= 
Effo  is  ~1.5  times  the  circumference  of  that  circle,  or  ~1.5×πEffS.  The  ratio  of  the 
gains is therefore GS/Go = |EffS/Effo|2 = (1/1.5π)2 = 0.045, or -13.5 dB.

10.4.6  Multi-beam antenna arrays 

Some  antenna  arrays  are  connected  so  as  to  produce  several  independent  beams  oriented  in 
different  directions  simultaneously;  phased  array  radar  antennas  and  cellular  telephone  base 
stations  are  common  examples.    When  multiple  antennas  are  used  for  reception,  each  can  be 
filtered  and  amplified  before  they  are  added  in  as  many  different  ways  as  desired.    Sometimes 
these combinations are predetermined and fixed, and sometimes  they are adjusted  in real  time  to 
place  nulls  on  sources  of  interference  or  to  place  maxima  on  transmitters  of  interest,  or  to  do 
both. 

The following cellular  telephone example  illustrates some of  the design  issues.   The driving 
issue here  is  the serious  limit  to network capacity  imposed by  the  limited bandwidth available at 
frequencies  suitable  for  urban  environments.    The  much  broader  spectrum  available  in  the 
centimeter  and  millimeter-wave  bands  propagates  primarily  line-of-sight  and  is  not  very  useful 
for  mobile  applications;  lower  frequencies  that  diffract  well  are  used  instead,  although  the 
available  bandwidth  is  less.    The  solution  is  to  reuse  the  same  low  frequencies  multiple  times, 
even within  the same small geographic area.   This is accomplished using array antennas that can 
have multiple inputs and outputs. 

A typical face of a cellular base station antenna has 3 or 4 elements that radiate only into the 
forward  half-space.  They  might  also  have  a  combining  circuit  that  forms  two  or  more  desired 
beams.   An  alternate way  to  use  these  arrays  based  on  switching  is  described  later.    Three  such 
faces,  such  as  those  illustrated  in  Figure  10.4.8(a)  with  four  elements  spaced  at  3λ,  might  be 
arranged in a triangle and produce two sets of antenna lobes, for example, the φ = 0 set and the φ 
= π set indicated in (b) by filled and dashed lines, respectively.

As before, φ  is  the phase angle difference  introduced between adjacent antenna elements.    Inter-
antenna separations of 3λ result in only 5 main lobes per face, because the two peaks in the plane 

- 336 -


of  each  face  are  approximately  zero  for  typical  element  factors.    Between  each  pair  of  peaks 
there are two small sidelobes, approximately 14 dB weaker as shown above. 

These two sets (φ = 0, φ = π) can share the same frequencies because digital communication 
techniques can  tolerate overlapping  signals  if one  is more  than ~10-dB weaker.   Since each  face 
of  the  antenna  can  be  connected  simultaneously  to  two  independent  receivers  and  two 
independent  transmitters,  as  many  as  six  calls  could  simultaneously  use  the  same  frequency 
band,  two  per  face.    A  single  face  would  not  normally  simultaneously  transmit  and  receive  the 
same frequency, however.  The lobe positions can also be scanned in angle by varying φ so as to 
fill any nulls.  Designing such antennas to maximize frequency reuse requires care and should be 
tailored  to  the  distribution  of  users within  the  local  environment.    In  unobstructed  environments 
there  is  no  strong  limit  to  the  number  of  elements  and  independent  beams  that  can  be  used  per 
face, or to the degree of frequency reuse.  Moreover, half the beams could be polarized one way, 
say  right-circular  or  horizontal,  and  the  other  half  could  be  polarized  with  the  orthogonal 
polarization,  thereby  doubling  again  the  number  of  possible  users  of  the  same  frequencies. 
Polarization  diversity  works  poorly  for  cellular  phones,  however,  because  users  orient  their 
dipole antennas as they wish. 

In practice, most urban cellular towers do not currently phase their antennas as shown above 
because many environments  suffer  from  severe multipath effects where  reflected versions of  the 
same  signals  arrive  at  the  receiving  tower  from many  angles with varying delays.    The  result  is 
 
that  at  each  antenna  element  the  phasors  arriving  from  different  directions with  different  phases 
and amplitudes will add to produce a net signal amplitude that can be large or small.  As a result 
one  of  the  elements  facing  a  particular  direction  may  have  a  signal-to-interference  ratio  that  is 
more  than  10  dB  stronger  than  another  for  this  reason  alone,  even  though  the  antenna  elements 
are  only  a  few  wavelengths  away  in  an  obstacle-free  local  environment.    Signals  have  different 
differential  delays  at  different  frequencies  and  therefore  their  peak  summed  values  at  each 
antenna  element  are  frequency  dependent.    The  antenna-use  strategy  in  this  case  is  to  assign 
users  to  frequencies  and  single  elements  that  are  observed  to  be  strong  for  that  user,  so  that 
another  user  could  be  overlaid  on  the  same  frequency  while  using  a  different  antenna  element 
pointed  in  the  same direction.   The  same  frequency-reuse  strategy  also works when  transmitting 
because of reciprocity. 

That  signal  strengths  are  frequency  dependent  in  multipath  environments  is  easily  seen  by 
considering an antenna receiving both  the direct  line-of-sight signal with delay  t1 and a reflected 
second signal with comparable strength and delay t2.  If the differential lag c(t2 - t1) = nλ = D for 
integer  n,  then  the  two  signals will  add  in  phase  and  reinforce  each  other.    If  the  lag D  =  (2n  + 
1)λ/2, then they will partially or completely cancel.   If D = 10λ and  the frequency f  increases by 
10 percent, then the lag measured in wavelengths will also change 10 percent as the sum makes a 
full  peak-to-peak  cycle  with  a  null  between.    Thus  the  gap  between  frequency  nulls  is  ~Δf  = 
f(λ/D) =  c/D Hz.  The  depth  of  the  null  depends  on  the  relative magnitudes  of  the  two  rays  that 
interfere.  As the number of rays increases the frequency structure becomes more complex.  This 
phenomenon  of  signals  fading  in  frequency  and  time  as  paths  and  frequencies  change  is  called 
multipath fading.

11.1  Aperture antennas and diffraction 

11.1.1 

Introduction 

Antennas  couple  circuits  to  radiation,  and  vice  versa,  at  wavelengths  that  can  extend  into  the 
infrared  region  and  beyond.  The  output  of  an  antenna  is  a  voltage  or  field  proportional  to  the 
input  field  strength⎯E(t)  and  at  the  same  frequency.    By  this  definition,  devices  that  merely 
amplify,  detect,  or  mix  signals  are  not  antennas  because  they  do  not  preserve  phase  and 
frequency, although they generally are connected to the outputs of antennas.  For example, some 
sensors merely sense the increased temperature and heating caused by incoming waves.  Chapter 
10  introduced  short-dipole  and  small-loop  antennas,  and  arrays  thereof.    Chapter  11  continues 
with an  introductory discussion of aperture antennas and diffraction  in Section 11.1, and of wire 
antennas  in  11.2.  Applications  are  then  discussed  in  Section  11.4  after  surveying  the  basics  of 
wave  propagation  and  thermal  emission  in  Section  11.3.    These  applications  include 
communications,  radar  and  lidar,  radio  astronomy,  and  remote  sensing.  Most  optical 
applications are deferred to Chapter 12. 

11.1.2  Diffraction by apertures 

Plane  waves  passing  through  finite  openings  emerge  propagating  in  all  directions  by  a  process 
called  diffraction.  Antennas  that  radiate  or  receive  plane  waves  within  finite  apertures  are 
aperture antennas.  Examples  include  the parabolic  reflector antennas used  for  radio astronomy, 
radar,  and  receiving  satellite  television  signals,  as  well  as  the  lenses  and  finite  apertures 
employed  in  cameras, microscopes,  telescopes,  and  many  optical  communications  systems.    As 
in  the  case  of  dipole  antennas;  we  assume  reciprocity  and  knowledge  of  the  source  fields  or 
equivalent currents. 

Since  we  have  already  derived  expressions  for  fields  radiated  by  arbitrary  current 
distributions,  one  approach  to  finding  aperture-radiated  fields  is  to  determine  current 
distributions  equivalent  to  the  given  aperture  fields.    Then  these  equivalent  currents  can  be 
replaced by a continuous array of Hertzian dipoles for which we know the radiated far fields. 

Consider a uniform current sheet  J  [A m-1] occupying  the x-z plane, as  illustrated  in Figure 
11.1.1.  Maxwell’s equations are then satisfied by:

(11.1.4)

Therefore  we  can  consider  any  plane  wave  emerging  from  an  aperture  as  emanating  from  an 
equivalent current sheet⎯Js given by (11.1.4) provided we neglect radiation from the charges and 
currents  induced  at  the  aperture  edges.    They  can  generally  be  neglected  if  the  aperture  is  large 
compared  to  a  wavelength  and  if  we  remain  close  to  the  y  axis  in  the  direction  of  propagation, 
because  then  the  aperture  area  dominates  the  observable  radiating  area.    This  approximation 
(11.1.4)  for  a  finite  aperture  is  valid  even  if  the  strength  of  the  plane  wave  varies  across  the 
aperture slowly relative to a wavelength. 

The  equivalent  current  sheet  (11.1.4)  radiates  according  to  (11.1.5)  [from  (10.2.8)],  where 
we represent the current sheet by an equivalent array of Hertzian dipoles of length dz and current

which  is  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  aperture  field  distribution  Eoz (

signals  between  the  time  and  frequency  domains,  this  reversible  transform  in  (11.1.10)  is 
between the aperture spatial domain and the far-field angular domain.

replace  the  aperture  coordinates  x  and  z  with  their  wavelength-normalized  equivalents  x/λ and 
z/λ, analogous to time t; α is analogous to frequency f. 

Assume  the  aperture  of  Figure  11.1.1  is  z-polarized,  has  dimensions  Lx  × Lz,  and  is 
uniformly illuminated with amplitude Eo.  Then its far fields can be computed using (11.1.10): 

55 In the Huygen’s approximation a factor of (1 + cosα)/2 is added to improve the accuracy, but this has little impact 
near the y axis.  In this expression α is the angle from the direction of propagation (y axis) in any direction.

Example 11.1A 
What  is  the  angle  between  the  first  nulls  of  the  diffraction  pattern  for  a  visible  laser  (λ  =  0.5 
microns)  illuminating  a  1-mm  square  aperture  (about  the  size  of  a  human  iris)?    What  is  the 
approximate  diffraction-limited  angular  resolution  of  the  human  visual  system?   How  does  this 
compare  to  the  maximum  angular  diameters  of  Venus,  Jupiter,  and  the  moon  (~1,  ~1,  and  ~30 
arc minutes in diameter, respectively)? 

Solution:	 The first null occurs at φ = sin-1(λ/L) ≅ 5×10-7/10-3 = 5×10-4 radians = 0.029° ≅ 1.7 arc 
minutes.  This is 70 percent larger than the planets Venus and Jupiter at their points of 
closest  approach  to  Earth,  and  ~6  percent  of  the  lunar  diameter.    Cleverly  designed 
neuronal  connections  in  the  human  visual  system  improve  on  this  for  linear  features, 
as can a dark-adapted iris, which has a larger diameter.

antenna  of  area  A  =  one  square  meter.    If  Pr  =  10-9  watts  are  required  by  the  receiver  for 
satisfactory  link  performance,  how  far  apart  r  can  these  two  terminals  be?   Does  this  depend  on 
the shape of the aperture antenna if A remains constant?

The  unit  vector  rˆ points  from  the  antenna  toward  the  receiver  and  r'   is  a  vector  that  locates 
Eo (r ')   within  the  aperture.    This  expression  assumes  the  receiver  is  sufficiently  far  from  the 
aperture  that  a  single  unit  vector  rˆ   suffices  for  the  entire  aperture  and  that  the  receiver  is 
therefore  in  the  Fraunhofer  region.  The  alternative  is  the  near-field  Fresnel  region  where

(gain of uniform aperture)  (11.1.25)

Perhaps  the  most  familiar  radio  aperture  antennas  are  parabolic  dishes  having  a  point  feed 
that  radiates  energy  toward  a  parabolic  mirror  so  as  to  produce  a  planar  wave  front  for 
transmission, as suggested in Figure 11.1.3(a).  Conversely, incoming radiation is focused by the 
mirror  on  the  antenna  feed,  which  intercepts  and  couples  it  to  a  transmission  line  connected  to 
the  receiver.   Typical  focal  lengths  (labeled  “f”  in  the  figure)  are  ~half  the  diameter D  for  radio 
systems, and are often much longer for optical mirrors that produce images.

Figure 11.1.3  Aperture antennas and angle of first null. 
 

Figure  11.1.3(b)  suggests  the  angle  θn  at  which  the  first  null  of  a  uniformly  illuminated 
rectangular  aperture  of  width  D  occurs;  it  is  the  angle  at  which  all  the  phasors  emanating  from 
each point on the aperture integrate in (11.1.10) to zero.  In this case it is easy to pair the phasors 
originating D/2 apart so each pair cancels at θn.   For example,  radiation from aperture element 2 
has  to  travel  λ/2  farther  than  radiation  from  element  1  and  therefore  they  cancel  each  other. 
Similarly radiation from elements 3 and 4 cancel, and the sum of all such pairs cancel at the null 
angle:

where θn ≅ λ/D for λ/D << 1. 

Approximately  the  same  null  angle  results  for  uniformly  illuminated  circular  apertures,  for 
which  integration yields θn  ≅ 1.2λ/D.   Consider  the human  eye, which has  a pupil  that normally 
is ~2 mm in diameter, but can dilate to ~1 cm in the dark.  For a wavelength of 5×10-7 meters, we 
find  the  normal  diffraction-limited  angular  resolution  of  the  eye  is  ~λ/D  =  5×10-7/(2×10-3)  = 
2.5×10-4 radians or ~0.014 degrees, or ~0.9 arc minutes.   For comparison,  the planets Venus and 
Jupiter are approximately 1 arc minute in diameter at closest approach, and the moon and sun are 
approximately 30 arc minutes in diameter. 

A  large  astronomical  telescope  like  the  200-inch  system  at  Palomar  has  a  nominal 
diffraction limit of λ/D ≅ 5×10-7/5.08 ≅ 10-7 radians or ~0.02 arc seconds, where there are 60 arc 
seconds  in  an  arc  minute,  and  60  arc  minutes  in  a  degree.    This  is  adequate  to  resolve  an 
automobile  on  the moon.   Unfortunately mirror  surface  imperfections,  focus misplacement,  and 
atmospheric  turbulence  limit  the  actual  angular  resolution  of  Palomar  to  ~1  arc  second  on  the 
very best nights; normal daytime turbulence is far worse. 

Practical  issues  generally  shape  the  design  of  parabolic  radio  antennas.    First,  mechanical 
(gravity  and  wind)  and  thermal  issues  (temperature  gradients)  usually  limit  their  angular 
resolution  to  ~1  arc minute; most  antennas  are  too  small  relative  to  λ  to  achieve  this  resolution, 
however.  Second,  the antenna  feed  that  illuminates  the parabola  tends  to spray  its  radiation  in a 
broad  pattern  that  extends  past  the  edge  of  the  reflector  creating  backlobes.  Third,  the  finite 
extent  of  the  aperture  results  in  an  antenna  pattern with  sidelobes  and  unwanted  responsiveness 
to directions beyond the main lobe. 

Equation  (11.1.10)  showed how  the angular dependence of  the  far-fields of an aperture was 
proportional  to  the Fourier  transform of  the aperture excitation function.   For example, (11.1.17) 
and Figure 11.1.2 showed the radiation pattern of a uniformly  illuminated aperture measuring Lx 
by Lz.  Significant energy was radiated beyond the first nulls at αx = λ/Lx and αz = λ/Lz.  A finite 
aperture necessarily radiates something at all angles,  just as a finite voltage pulse  in a circuit has 
at  least  some  energy  at  all  frequencies;  the  sharper  the  pulse  edges,  the  more  high-frequency 
content  they  have.  Therefore,  reducing  the  sharp  discontinuities  in  field  strength  at  the  aperture 
edge,  a  strategy  called  tapering,  can  reduce  diffraction  sidelobes.    Antenna  feeds  are  typically 
designed  to  reduce  field  strengths  by  factors  of  2-4  at  the  mirror  edges  for  this  reason,  but  the 
resulting  effective  reduction  in  aperture  diameter  produces  a  slightly  broader  main  lobe,  just  as 
the Fourier transform of a narrower pulse produces a broader spectral band.   

A  final  consideration  is  sometimes  important  when  designing  aperture  antennas,  and  that 
involves aperture blockage, which results when transmitted radiation reflected from the mirror is 
blocked or scattered by the antenna feed at the focus of the parabola.  Not only does the scattered 
radiation  contribute  to  side  or  back  lobes,  but  it  also  is  lost  to  the  main  beam.    Example  11.1C 
illustrates these issues.

Example 11.1C 
A  uniformly  illuminated  square  aperture  is  1000  wavelengths  long  on  each  side.    What  is  its 
antenna  gain  G(αx,  αz)  for  α  <<  1?   What  is  the  gain  Go'  if  the  center  of  this  fully  illuminated 
aperture  is  blocked  by  a  square  absorber  100  wavelengths  on  a  side?    What  is  the  extent  and 
approximate magnitude of the sidelobes introduced by the blockage? 

Solution:  The on-axis gain Go = A4π/λ2 = 10002  × 4π.  The angular dependence is proportional

Equations  (11.1.13–17).  If  the  blocked  portion  of  the  aperture  is  illuminated  so  the 
energy  there  is  absorbed,  then  the  total  transmitted  power  Pt  in  the  expression

0.992  ≅  0.98.  Thus  Go'  ≅  0.98  Go.  If  the  blocked  portion  of  the  aperture  were  not 
illuminated so as  to avoid  the one percent absorption,  then Go'(0,0) would be reduced 
by only 1 percent: Go' = A'4π/λ2.  The sidelobes for  the blocked aperture follow from 
the  Fourier  transform  (11.1.13), where  the  aperture  excitation Eo(x,z)  is  the  sum  of  a 
positive square “boxcar” function 1000λ on a side, and a negative square boxcar 100λ 
on a side.  Since  this  transform  is  linear,  E ff  ( α x , α z )   is  the sum of  the  transforms of 
the  positive  and  negative  boxcar  functions,  and  the  antenna  sidelobes  therefore  have 
contributions from each.  Most important is the main lobe of the diffraction pattern of 
the  smaller  “blockage”  boxcar,  which  has  magnitude  ~0.012  that  of  Go',  and  a  half-
power beamwidth θBB that is 10 times greater than the main lobe of the larger boxcar: 
θBB  ≅ λ/DB  =  λ/100λ.    The  total  antenna  pattern  is  the  square  of  the  summed 
transforms  and  more  complicated;  the  innermost  few  sidelobes  are  approximately 
those  of  the  original  antenna,  while  the  blockage-induced  sidelobes  are  more 
important at greater angles. 

11.1.4  Near-field diffraction and Fresnel zones 

Often receivers are sufficiently close to the source that the Fraunhofer parallel-ray approximation 
of (11.1.7) is invalid.  	 Then the Huygen’s approximation (11.1.21) can be used: 

Eoz (x,z  e )  -jk r  x,y)dx dz  
(

j 
E ff  ≅ θ 2 r (1 + cosβ)(cid:119)∫∫ A
ˆ
λ 
for which  the distance between  the  receiver and  the point x,y  in  the aperture  is defined as  r(x,y). 
This region close  to a source or obstacle where the Fraunhofer approximation  is  invalid  is called 
the Fresnel region. 

(Huygen’s approximation)  (11.1.27)

If  the  phase  of  Eoz  in  the  source  aperture  is  constant  everywhere,  then  contributions  to 
Eff(0,0)  from  some  parts  of  the  aperture  will  tend  to  cancel  contributions  from  other  parts 
because  they  are  out  of  phase.  For  example,  contributions  from  the  central  circular  zone where 
r(x,y)  ranges  from  ro  to  ro  +  λ/2  will  largely  cancel  the  contributions  from  the  surrounding  ring 
where  r(x,y)  ranges  from  ro  +  λ/2  to  ro  +  λ;  it  is  easily  shown  that  these  two  rings  have 
approximately  the  same  area,  as  do  all  such  rings  over  which  the  delay  varies  by  λ/2.56    Such  
rings are illustrated in Figure 11.1.4(a).

One  technique  for  maximizing  diffraction  toward  an  observer  is  therefore  simply  to 
physically block radiation from those alternate zones contributing negative fields, as suggested in 
Figure 11.1.4(a).  Such a blocking device is called a Fresnel zone plate.  The central ring having 
positive phase  is called  the Fresnel zone.  Note  that  if only  the central zone  is permitted  to pass, 
the received intensity is maximum, and if the first two zones pass, the received intensity is nearly 
zero  because  they  have  approximately  the  same  area.    The  second  zone  is  weaker,  however, 
because r and θ are larger.  Three zones can yield nearly the same intensity as the first zone alone 
because  two  of  the  three  zones  nearly  cancel,  and  so  on.   By  blocking  alternate  zones  the 
received intensity can be many times greater than if there were no blockage at all.  Thus a multi-
ring zone plate acts as a lense by focusing energy received over a much larger area than would be 
intercepted  by  the  receiver  alone.  This  type  of  lense  is  particularly  valuable  for  focusing  very 
short-wave  radiation  such  as  x-rays  which  are  difficult  to  reflect  or  diffract  using  traditional 
mirrors or lenses. 

Another  advantage  of  zone  plate  lenses  is  that  they  can  be  manufactured  lithographically, 
and  their  critical  dimensions  are  usually many  times  larger  than  the wavelengths  involved.    For 
example, an x-ray zone plate designed to operate at λ = 10-8 [m] at a distance ro of one centimeter 

56 The area of  the  inner circle  (radius a)  is πa2 = π[(ro + λ/2)2  -  ro
2] ≅ πroλ  if λ << 2ro.   The area of  the  immediately 
surrounding  Fresnel  ring  (radius  b)  is  π(b2  -  a2)  =  π[(ro  +  λ)2  -  ro
2]  - π[(ro  +  λ/2)2  -  ro
2]  ≅ πroλ,  subject  to  the  same 
approximation.  Similarly, all other Fresnel rings can be shown to have approximately the same area if λ << 2ro.

will have a central zone of diameter 2[(ro + λ/2)2 - ro
2]0.5  ≅ 2(roλ)0.5 = 2×10-5 meters, a dimension 
easily fabricated using modern semiconductor lithographic techniques. 

Another  example  of  diffraction  is  wireless  communications  in  urban  environments,  which 
often  involves  line-of-sight  reception  of  waves  past  linear  obstacles  slightly  to  one  side  or 
slightly  obscuring  the  source.  Again Huygen’s  equation  (11.1.27)  can  be  used  to  determine  the 
result.  Referring to Figure 11.1.4(b), if there is no blockage, traditional equations can be used to 
compute  the  received  intensity.    If  exactly  half  the  path  is  blocked  by  a  wall  obscuring  the 
bottom  half  of  the  illuminated  aperture,  for  example,  then  the  integral  in  (11.1.27)  will  yield 
2)  will  be  reduced  by  a 
exactly  half  the  previous  value  of  Eff,  and  the  power  (proportional  to  Eff
factor  of  four,  or  ~6dB.  If  the  observer  moves  up  or  down  less  than  ~half  the  radius  of  the 
Fresnel  zone,  then  the  received  power will  vary  only modestly.    For  example,  an  FM  radio  (say 
108  Hz)  about  100  meters  beyond  a  tall  wide  metal  wall  can  have  a  line  of  sight  that  passes 
through  the  wall  a  distance  of  ~(rλ)0.5/2  =  17  meters  below  its  top  without  suffering  great  loss; 
(rλ)0.5  is  the  radius  of  the  Fresnel  zone.    Conversely,  a  line-of-sight  that  passes  less  than  ~17 
meters above the top of the wall will also experience modest diffractive effects. 

The  Fresnel  region  approximately  begins  when  the  central  ray  arrives  at  distance  ro,  more 
than λ/16 ahead of rays from the perimeter of an aperture of diameter D.  That is:

11.2  Wire antennas 

11.2.1  Introduction to wire antennas 

(11.1.29)

(Fresnel region)  (11.1.30)

Exact  solution  of Maxwell’s  equations  for  antennas  is  difficult  because  antennas  typically  have 
complex  shapes  for  which  it  is  difficult  to  match  boundary  conditions.    Often  complex  wave 
expansions with many  degrees  of  freedom  are  required,  and  even modern  software  tools  can  be 
challenged.  Fortunately,  most  common  wire  antennas  permit  their  current  distributions  to  be 
guessed  accurately  relative  to  the  given  terminal  current,  as  explained  in  Section  11.2.2.    Once 
the  current  distribution  is  known  everywhere,  the  radiated  fields,  radiation  and  dissipative 

- 349 -


resistance, antenna gain, and antenna effective area can be calculated.  If the antenna is used at a 
frequency far from resonance, the reactance can also be estimated. 

If  the  antenna  is  small  compared  to  a  wavelength  λ  then  its  current  distribution  I  and  the 
open-circuit  voltage  VTh  can  be  determined  using  the  quasistatic  approximation.    If  the  current 
distribution  is  known,  then  the  radiated  far-fields  E ff   can  be  computed  using  (10.2.8)  by 
integrating  the  contributions  ΔE ff   from  each  short  current  element  Id  (d  is  the  element  length 
and is replaced by ds in the integral), where: 
ΔE ff  = θ ˆ jk Idηo e− jkr sin

(11.2.2)

For antennas small compared to λ the factor before the integral of (11.2.2) is nearly constant over 
the integrated length S, so average values suffice.  If the wires run in more than one direction, the 
definition of  θˆ  and θ must change accordingly; θ is defined by the local angle between  I  and  rˆ , 
where  rˆ   is  the  unit  vector  pointing  from  the  antenna  to  the  observer,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
10.2.3.  Equation  (11.2.2), not  surprisingly,  reduces  to  (11.2.1)  for  a  short  straight wire  carrying 
constant current I over a distance d << λ. 

Once the radiated fields are known for a given antenna input current I, the radiated intensity 
can be  integrated over a  sphere  surrounding  the antenna  to yield  the  total power  radiated PR and 
the  radiation  resistance  Rr,  which  usually  dominates  the  resistive  component  of  the  antenna 
impedance and corresponds to power lost through radiation (10.3.16).  The radiation resistance is 
simply related to PR: 

R r  =

2P
R  [ohms
]  
I 2

 

(radiation resistance) 

(11.2.3) 

The open-circuit voltage can also be easily estimated for wire antennas small compared to λ. 
For  example,  the  open-circuit  voltage  induced  across  a  short  dipole  antenna  shown  in  Figure 
10.3.1 is simply the projection of the incident electric field  E  on the electrical centers of the two 
metallic  structures  comprising  the  dipole,  and  Example  10.3D  showed  how  the  open-circuit 
voltage  across  a  loop  antenna  was  proportional  to  the  time  derivative  of  the  magnetic  flux 
through  it. 
In  both  cases  the  open-circuit  voltage  reveals  the  directional  properties  of  the 
antenna.  Computation  of  the  radiation  resistance  requires  knowledge  of  the  radiated  fields  and 
integration  of  the  radiated  power  over  all  angles,  however.    Equation  (10.3.16)  showed  that  the 
radiation  resistance  of  a  short  dipole  antenna  of  length  d  is  (2πηo/3)(d/λ)2  ohms.    Slightly more 
complicated  integrals over angles yield  the  radiation  resistance  for half-wave dipoles of  length d 
and  N-turn  loop  antennas  of  diameter  d  <<  λ:  ~73  ohms  and  ~1.9×104N2(d/λ)4  ohms, 
respectively.  The  higher  radiation  resistance  of  loop  antennas  often makes  them  the  antenna  of 

- 350 -


choice  when  space  is  limited  relative  to  wavelength,  particularly  when  they  are  wound  on  a 
ferrite core (μ >> μo) that increases their magnetic dipole moment. 

Most  wire  antennas  are  not  small  compared  to  a  wavelength,  however,  and  the methods  of 
the next section are then often used. 

11.2.2  Current distribution on wires 

The  current  distribution  on  wires  is  governed  by  Maxwell’s  equations,  which  are  most  easily 
solved for simple geometries such as  that of a coaxial cable, as discussed  in Example 7.1B.   The 
fields for a TEM wave in a coaxial cable are cylindrically symmetric and a function of radius r:   

( ) r ⎡⎣  V  m  -1⎦⎤

(11.2.5)

The energy density and Poynting’s vector are proportional  to  field strength squared, so  they 
decay  as  r-2.    Therefore  the  electromagnetic  behavior  of  the  line  is  dominated  by  the  geometry 
near  the  central  conductor  where  most  of  the  electromagnetic  energy  is  located,  and  the  outer 
conductor  can  be  deformed  substantially  before  the  fields  near  the  center  are  significantly 
perturbed.  For  example,  two-thirds  of  the  power  propagates  within  10  cm  of  a  1-mm  wire 
centered  within  a  1-meter  outer  cylinder,  even  though  this  represents  only  one-percent  of  the 
volume.    This  is  easily  shown  by  integrating  the  energy  density  from  radius  a  to  radius  b,

Therefore  the  fields  near  the  axis  of  the  coaxial  cable  illustrated  in  Figure  11.2.1(a)  are 
altered  but  little  if  the  outer  conductor  is  replaced  by  a  ground  plane  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
11.2.1(b),  or  even  by  a  second  wire,  as  shown  in  Figure  11.2.1(c).    The  significance  of  Figure 
11.2.1  is  therefore  that  current  distributions  on  thin  wire  antennas  closely  resemble  those  on 
equivalent  TEM  lines,  provided  the  lines  are  not  so  many  wavelengths  long  that  the  energy  is 
lost before it reaches the end, or so tightly bent that the segments induce strong voltages on their 
neighbors.  This TEM approximation is valid for understanding the examples of this section. 

A  widely  used  antenna  is  the  half-wave  dipole,  illustrated  in  Figure  11.2.1(d),  which 
exhibits  essentially  no  reactive  impedance  because  the  electric  and  magnetic  energy  storages 
approximately  balance.    The  radiation  resistance  for  any  half-wave  dipole  in  free  space  is  ~73 
ohms.    Section  7.4.2  discusses  how  these  energies  balance  in  any  TEM  structure  of  length  D  = 
nλ/2 where n is an integer.  Typical bandwidths Δω of a half-wave dipole are Δω/ωo = 1/Q ≅ 0.1, 
where Q = ωowT/Pd, as discussed in Section 7.4.3 and (7.4.4). 

57 The magnetic field around a central wire, H = I/2πr, was given in (1.4.3).

In  these  idealized cases  the currents everywhere on  the antenna approach zero one-quarter cycle 
later  as  the  energy  all  converts  from  magnetic  to  electric.    The  voltage  distributions  when  the 
currents  are  zero  resemble  those on  the  equivalent TEM  lines,  and  are offset  spatially by λ/4;  at

resonance  the  voltage  peaks  coincide  with  the  current  nulls.    For  example,  the  voltages  and 
currents  for  Figure  11.2.2(a)  resemble  those  of  the  open-circuited  TEM  resonator  of  Figure 
7.4.1(a).  The  actual  current  and  voltage  distributions  are  slightly  different  from  those  pictured 
because  radiation  tends  to  weaken  the  currents  farther  from  the  antenna  terminals,  and  because 
such free-standing or bent wires are not true TEM lines. 

Figure  11.2.2(b)  illustrates  how  terminal  currents  (Io)  can  be  made  less  than  one-third  the 
peak  currents  (3.2  Io)  flowing  on  the  antenna  simply  by  lengthening  the  two  arms  so  they  are 
each  slightly  longer  than  λ/2  so  the  current  is  close  to  a  null  at  the  terminals.    Because  smaller 
terminal  currents  thus  correspond  to  larger  antenna  currents  and  radiated  power,  the  effective 
radiation resistance of this antenna is increased well above the nominal 73 ohms of the half-wave 
dipole  of  (a).  The  reactance  is  slightly  capacitive,  however,  and  should  be  canceled  with  an 
inductor.  Figure  11.2.2(c)  illustrates  how  the  peak  currents  can  be  made  different  in  the  two 
arms; note  that  the  currents  fed  to  the  two  arms must be  equal  and opposite,  and  this  fact  forces 
the  two  peak  currents  in  the  arms  to  differ.
  Figures  (d)  and  (e)  show  more  elaborate 
configurations,  demonstrating  that  wire  antennas  do  not  have  to  lie  in  a  straight  line.    The 
patterns for these antennas are discussed in the next section. 

11.2.3  Antenna patterns 

Once the current distributions on wire antennas are known, the antenna patterns can be computed 
using  (11.2.2).  Consider  first  the  dipole  antenna  of  Figure  11.2.2(a)  and  let  its  length  be  d,  its 
terminal current be Io ′, and its maximum current be Io.  Then (11.2.2) becomes:

This  expression,  which  requires  some  effort  to  derive,  applies  to  symmetric  dipole  antennas  of 
any  modest  length  d;  Io  is  the  maximum  current,  which  is  not  necessarily  the  terminal  current. 
The common half-wave dipole has d = λ/2, so (11.2.7) reduces to:

The  antenna  of  Figure  11.2.2(b)  can  be  considered  to  be  a  two-element  antenna  array  (see 
Section  10.4.1)  for which  the  two  radiated  phasors  add  in  some  directions  and  cancel  in  others, 
depending on  the differential phase  lag between  the  two  rays. Antenna  (b) has  its peak gain at θ 
=  π/2,  but  its  beamwidth  is  less  than  for  (a)  because  rays  from  the  two  arms  of  the  dipole  are 
increasingly  out  of  phase  for  propagation  directions  closer  to  the  z  axis,  even more  than  for  the 
half-wave  dipole;  thus  the  gain  of  (b)  modestly  exceeds  that  of  (a).    Whether  one  determines 
patterns  numerically  or  by  using  the more  intuitive  phasor  addition  approach  of  Sections  10.4.1 

(half-wave dipole)

and  10.4.5  is  a  matter  of  choice.    Antenna  (c)  has  very  modest  nulls  for  θ  close  to  the  ±z  axis. 
The  nulls  are  weak  because  the  electric  field  due  to  3.2Io  is  only  slightly  reduced  by  the 
contributions from the phase-reversed segment carrying Io. 

Simple  inspection  of  the  current  distribution  for  the  antenna  of  Figure  11.2.2(d)  and  use  of 
the methods of Section 10.4.1  reveal  that  its pattern has peaks  in gain along  the ±x and ±y axes, 
and  a null  along  the ±z  axes.  Extending  simple  superposition  and phase  cancellation  arguments 
to  other  angular  directions  makes  it  possible  to  guess  the  form  of  the  complete  antenna  pattern 
G(θ,φ),  and  therefore  to  check  the  accuracy  of  any  integration  using  (11.2.6)  for  all  antenna 
arms.    Similar  simple  phase  addition/cancellation  analysis  reveals  that  the  more  complicated 
antenna  (e)  has  gain  peaks  along  the  ±x  and  ±y  axes,  and  nulls  along  the  ±z  axes,  although  the 
polarization  of  each  peak  is  somewhat  different,  as  discussed  in  an  example.    Exact 
determination of pattern (e)  is confused by  the  fact  that  these wires are sufficiently close  to each 
other  to  interact,  so  the  current  distribution  may  be  modified  relative  to  the  nominal  TEM 
assumption sketched in the figure. 

Example 11.2A 
Determine  the  relative  gains  and  polarizations  along  the  ±x,  ±y,  and  ±z  axes  for  the  antenna 
illustrated in Figure 11.2.2(e). 

Solution:	 The two x-oriented wires do not radiate in the ±x direction.  The four z-oriented wires 
emit radiation that cancels in that direction (one pair cancels the other), while the two 
y-oriented  wires  radiate  in-phase  y-polarized  radiation  in  the  ±x  direction  with 
relative  total  electric  field  strength  Ey  =  2.  We  assume  each  λ/2  segment  radiates  a 
relative  electric  field  of  unity.    Similarly,  the  two  y-oriented  wires  do  not  radiate  in 
the  ±y  direction.  The  four  z-oriented  wires  emit  radiation  that  cancels  in  that 
direction  (one pair cancels  the other), while  the  two x-oriented wires  radiate  in-phase 
x-polarized radiation  in  the ±y direction with  relative  total electric  field strength Ex = 
2.  The  four  z-oriented  wires  do  not  radiate  in  the  ±z  direction,  and  the  two  out-of­
phase pairs of currents  in  the x and y directions also cancel  in  that direction, yielding 
a  perfect  null.    Thus  the  gains  are  equal  in  the  x  and  y  directions  (but  with  x 
polarization along the y axis, and y-polarization along the x axis), and the gain is zero 
on the z axis. 

11.3  Propagation of radio waves and thermal emission 

11.3.1  Multipath propagation 

Electromagnetic waves can be absorbed, refracted, and scattered as they propagate through linear 
media.    One  result  of  this  is  that  beams  from  the  same  transmitter  can  arrive  at  a  receiver  from 
multiple  directions  simultaneously  with  differing  delays,  strengths,  polarizations,  and  Doppler 
shifts.    These  separate  phasors  add  constructively  or  destructively  to  yield  an  enhanced  or 
diminished  total  response  that  is  generally  frequency  dependent.    Since  cellular  telephones  are 

- 354 -


mobile  and  seldom  have  a  completely  unobstructed  propagation  path,  they  often  exhibit  strong 
fading and multipath effects. 

Consider  first  the  simple  case where  a  single  beam  arrives  via  a  direct  path  and  a  reflected 
beam with one-quarter the power of the first arrives along a reflected path that is 100λ longer.  If 
the  powers  of  these  two  beams  are  constant,  then  the  total  received  power  will  fluctuate  with 
frequency.  If  the  voltage  received  for  the  direct  beam  is  V  and  that  of  the  second  beam  is  V/2 
corresponding  to  quarter  power,  then  when  they  are  in  phase  the  total  received  power  is 
1.52|V|2/2R,  where  R  is  the  circuit  impedance.    When  they  are  180o  out  of  phase  the  power  is 
0.52|V|2/2R, or one-ninth the maximum.  This shift between maximum and minimum occurs each 
time the relative delay between the two paths changes by λ/2.  Because the differential delay D is 
~100λ,  this  represents  a  frequency  change  Δf  of  only  one  part  in  200;  Δf/f  =  λ/2D.    Note  that 
reflections  can  enhance  or  diminish  the  main  signal,  and  clever  antenna  arrays  can  always 
compensate  for  the differential delays experienced  from different directions so as  to enhance  the 
result. 

Since  cellular  phones  can  have  path  differences  of  ~1  km  at  wavelengths  of  ~10  cm,  their 
two-beam  frequency  maxima  can  be  separated  by  as  little  as  10-4f,  where  f  can  be  ~109  Hz. 
Fortunately  this  separation  of  105  Hz  is  large  compared  to  typical  voice  bandwidths. 
Alternatively, cellular phone signals can be coded  to cover bandwidths  large compared  to fading 
bandwidths  so  the  received  signal  strength  is  averaged  over multiple  frequency  nulls  and  peaks 
and is therefore more stable. 

Multipath  also  produces  nulls  in  space  if  the  rays  arrive  from  different  directions.    For 
example, if two rays A and B of wavelength λ and arrive from angles separated by a small angle 
γ,  then  the distance D between  intensity maxima  and minima  along  a  line  roughly perpendicular 
to  the  direction  of  arrival will  be ~λ/(2sinγ).  The  geometry  is  sketched  in Figure  11.3.1.   Three 
or  more  beams  can  be  analyzed  by  similar  phasor  addition  methods.    Sometimes  one  of  the 
beams  is  reflected  from  a  moving  surface,  or  the  transmitter  or  receiver  are  moving,  so  these 
maxima and minima can vary rapidly with time.

Example 11.3A 
Normal  broadcast NTSC  television  signals  have  6-MHz  bandwidth.    If  a metal  building  reflects 
perfectly  a  signal  that  travels  a  distance  L  further  than  the  direct  beam  before  the  two  equal-
strength  beams  sum  at  the  receiving  antenna,  how  large  can  L  be  and  still  ensure  that  there  are 
not two nulls in the 6-MHz passband between 100 and 106 MHz? 

Solution:	 The  differential  path  L  is  L/λ  wavelengths  long. 
If  this  number  of  wavelengths 
increases by one,  then L/λ' = L/λ + 1 as λ decreases  to λ';  this  implies λ/λ' = 1 + λ/L 
=  f  '/f  =  1.06.   When  the  direct  and  reflected  signals  sum,  the  2π  phase  change  over 
this  frequency band will produce one null, or almost  two nulls  if  they  fall at  the band 
edges.  Note  that  only  the  differential  path  length  is  important  here.    Therefore  L  = 
λ/(1.06 - 1) ≅ 16.7λ = 16.7c/f ≅ 16.7×3×108/108 = 50.0 meters. 

11.3.2  Absorption, scattering, and diffraction 

The  terrestrial  atmosphere  can  absorb,  scatter,  and  refract  electromagnetic  radiation.    The 
dominant  gaseous  absorbers  at  radio  and  microwave  wavelengths  are  water  vapor  and  oxygen. 
At  submillimeter  and  infrared  wavelengths,  numerous  trace  gases  such  as  ozone,  NO,  CO,  OH, 
and others also become important.  At wavelengths longer than 3 mm only the oxygen absorption 
band ~50 - 70 GHz is reasonably opaque.  Horizontal attenuation at some frequencies 57-63 GHz 
exceeds  10  dB/km,  and  vertical  attenuation  can  exceed  100  dB.    The  water  vapor  band  20-24 
GHz  absorbs  less  than  25  percent  of  radiation  transmitted  toward  zenith  or  along  a  ~2-km 
horizontal path. 

More  important  at  low  frequencies  is  the  ionosphere,  which  reflects  all  radiation  below  its 
plasma frequency fo, as discussed in Section 9.5.3.  Radio waves transmitted vertically upward at 
frequency  f  are  reflected  directly  back  if  any  ionospheric  layer  has  a  plasma  frequency  fp  <  f, 
where  fp  is  given  by  (9.5.25)  and  is  usually  below  15 MHz.   The  ionosphere  generally  extends 
from  ~70  to  ~700  km  altitude,  with  electron  densities  peaking  ~300  km  and  exhibiting 
significant drops below ~200 km at night when  solar  radiation no  longer  ionizes  the atmosphere 
fast enough to overcome recombination. 

Above  the  plasma  frequency  fp  radio  waves  are  also  perfectly  reflected  at  an  angle  of 
reflection  θr  equal  to  the  angle  of  incidence  θi  if  θi  exceeds  the  critical  angle  θc(f)  (9.2.30)  for 
any  ionospheric  layer.  The  critical  angle  θc(f)  =  sin-1(εion/εo),  where  the  permittivity  of  the 
ionosphere  εion(f)  =  εo[1  -  (fp/f)2].  Since  εo  >  εion  at  any  finite  frequency,  there  exists  a  grazing 
angle of incidence θi where waves are perfectly reflected from the ionosphere at frequencies well 
above  fp.  The  curvature  of  the  earth  precludes  grazing  incidence  with  θi  →  90°  unless  the 
bottom  surface  of  the  ionosphere  is  substantially  tilted.    Therefore  the  maximum  frequency  at 
which  radio  waves  can  bounce  around  the  world  between  the  ionosphere  and  the  surface  of  the 
earth is limited to ~2fp, depending on the height of the ionosphere for the frequency of interest. 

The most important non-gaseous atmospheric absorbers are clouds and rain, where the latter 
can  attenuate  signals  30  dB  or  more.  Rain  is  a  major  absorber  for  centimeter-wavelength 
satellite  dishes,  partly  in  the  atmosphere  and  partly  as  the  rain  accumulates  on  the  antennas.   At 

- 356 -


longer  wavelengths  most  systems  have  enough  sensitivity  to  tolerate  such  attenuation.    In 
comparison,  clouds  are  usually  not  a  problem  except  for  through-the-air  optical  communication 
systems. 

Atmospheric  refraction  is  dominated  by  water  vapor  at  radio  wavelengths  and  by 
atmospheric  density  at  optical  wavelengths.    These  effects  are  not  trivial.    The  radio  sun  can 
appear  to  set  almost one  solar diameter  later on  a very humid  summer day  (the  sun  emits  strong 
radio  waves  too),  and  weak  scattering  from  inhomogeneities  in  atmospheric  humidity  was  once 
used  as  a  major  long-distance  radio  communications  technique  that  avoided  reliance  on  signals 
reflected  from  the  ionosphere,  as  well  as  providing  bandwidths  of  several  GHz.    Refraction  by 
the  ionosphere  is  even  more  extreme,  and  the  angles  of  refraction  can  be  computed  using  the 
properties of plasmas noted in Section 9.5.3 and Snell’s law (9.2.26). 

It  is  often  convenient  to  model  urban  multipath  and  diffractive  communications  links  by  a 
power  law  other  than  r-2.  One  common model  is  r-3.8, which  approximates  the  random weaking 
of signals by sequences of urban obstacles as signals 1.5-5 GHz propagate further.   In any study 
 
of  wireless  communications  systems  propagation  effects  such  as  these  must  always  be 
considered. 

11.3.3  Thermal emission 

A  final  effect  impacting  wireless  communications  systems  is  thermal  noise  arising  from  the 
environment,  plus  other  forms  of  interference.    Usually  the  thermal  noise  is  considered 
interference  too,  but  in  radio  astronomy  and  remote  sensing  it  is  the  signal  of  interest.   Thermal 
noise  arises  from  electromagnetic  radiation  emitted  by  electrons  colliding  randomly  with  other 
particles  in  thermal  equilibrium  at  temperature T.   These  collisions  cause  electrons  to  accelerate 
in  random  directions  and  therefore  radiate.    Thus  every  material  object  or  medium  radiates 
thermal  noise  provided  that  object  or  medium  is  coupled  to  the  radiation  field  to  any  degree  at 
all.  Decoupled media perfectly reflect or transmit electromagnetic radiation without loss and are 
rare. 

Thermal radiation propagating in a single-mode transmission line has intensity:

I W/Hz 
e 

≅ kT  for hf  (cid:19) kT

(thermal intensity) 

(11.3.1) 

Because  there  is  a  one-to-one  relationship  between  intensity  I  and  the  corresponding 
brightness  temperature  T,  the  brightness  temperature  T[K]  =  I/k  often  replaces  I  because  of  its 
more  natural  physical  significance.  T  is  the  temperature  of  a matched  load  (R  = Zo)  that would 
naturally  radiate  the  same  intensity  I  =  kT  Watts/Hz  for  hf  <<  kT.    This  Rayleigh-Jeans 
approximation for I is valid at temperatures T above 50K for all frequencies f below ~100 GHz. 

Thus the Thevenin equivalent circuit of a resistor at temperature T includes a voltage source 
producing  a  generally  observable  gaussian  white  voltage  vTh(t)  called  Johnson  noise.  This 
 

58 eδ = 1 + δ + δ2/2! +… for δ << 1. 

- 357 -


source  voltage  vTh(t)  radiates  kTB  [W]  down  a matched  transmission  line within  the  bandwidth 
 This Johnson noise voltage vTh(t) also divides across  the Thevenin  resistance R and  its 
B  [Hz].
matched load Zo = R to produce the propagating line voltage v+(t, z=0) = vTh/2.  But the radiated

(11.3.2)

Therefore within  bandwidth B  the  root-mean-square  open-circuit  thermal  voltage  vThrms  across  a 
resistor R at temperature T is: 

vThrms  = 4kTBR [V ]	  

(Johnson noise) 

(11.3.3) 

A TEM  line of  impedance Zo does not add any  Johnson noise  to  that of  the  resistor  if  the  line  is 
lossless and therefore decoupled from the radiation. 

Any  antenna  matched  to  its  TEM  transmission  line  therefore  receives  thermal  noise  power 
kTAB [W] from the environment, where TA is defined as the antenna temperature. TA is the gain-
weighted average of the brightness temperature TB of the environment over 4π steradians:

11.3.4  Radio astronomy and remote sensing 

An  antenna  looking  down  at  the  earth  sees  a  brightness  temperature  TB,  which  is  the  sum  of 
thermal  radiation  emitted  by  the  earth  plus  downward  propagating  power  that  is  then  reflected 
from  the same surface:   TB = ξT +  |Γ|2TB', where  the emissivity of  the earth ξ = 1  -  |Γ|2, Γ  is  the 
wave  reflection  coefficient  of  the  earth,  and  TB'  is  the  brightness  temperature  of  the  radiation 
reflected  from  the  earth  into  the  antenna  beam.    The  radiation  from  space  at  microwave 
frequencies  has  a  brightness  temperature  near  2.7K  arising  from  the  "big  bang"  that  occurred  at 
the  birth  of  the  universe,  and  reaches  temperatures  over  7000K  in  the  direction  of  the  sun  and 
certain astronomical objects, depending on  frequency.   The  science of  radio astronomy  involves 
the study of such celestial radio waves. 

The  emissivity  1  -  |Γ|2  of  the  terrestrial  surface  is  typically  0.85-0.98  over  land  and  >(cid:4) 0.3 
over  ocean.  Since  most  communications  antennas  point  horizontally,  about  half  their  beam 
intercepts  the  earth  (~260K)  and  half  intercepts  space  (~4K  at  microwave  frequencies),  so  the 
thermal  noise  from  the  environment  typically  adds  ~132K  to  the  antenna  temperature  and  total 
system noise.

The  study  of  natural  radio,  infrared,  and  visible  emission  from  the  earth  is  called  remote 
sensing,  although  one  can  also  remotely  sense  biological,  manufacturing,  and  other  systems. 
Today  many  satellites  in  polar  and  geostationary  orbits  routinely  observe  the  earth  at  tens  to 
thousands  of  wavelengths  across  the  radio  and  optical  spectrum  for  meteorological  and  other 
geophysical  purposes.  For  example,  a  satellite  observing  in  the  opaque  53-67  GHz  oxygen 
resonance  band  can  not  see much  lower  than  70  km  altitude  at  the  very  centers  of  the  strongest 
spectral  lines,  and  therefore  those  channels  observe  the  temperature  of  the  atmosphere  at  those 
high altitudes.  At nearby frequencies where the atmosphere is more transparent these sensors see 
the air temperatures at lower altitudes.  Combinations of such observations yield the temperature 
profile  of  the  atmosphere  all  over  the  globe,  enabling  better  numerical  weather  predictions. 
Channels  near  the  centers  of water  vapor,  ozone,  and  other  spectral  lines  can  similarly measure 
their  abundance  and  altitude  profiles  for  similar  purposes.    Channels  in  the  more  transparent 
bands  see  closer  to  the  terrestrial  surface  and  permit  estimates  to  be  made  of  rain  rate,  surface 
winds, soil moisture, and other parameters. 

Communications,  radioastronomy,  and  remote  sensing  systems  all  receive  non-thermal 
radio  interference as well.   Man-made  interference comes from other  transmitters  in  the same or 
nearby  bands,  automobiles,  microwave  ovens,  motors,  power  supplies,  corona  around  power 
lines,  and  other  electrical  devices.    Each  unshielded  wire  in  any  electrical  device  is  a  small 
antenna  that  radiates.   For  example,  computers  can  emit highly  structured  signals  that  reveal  the 
state  of  the  computation  and,  in  special  cases,  even  the  contents  of  registers.    Poorly  shielded 
power  supplies  often  radiate  at  very  high  harmonics  of  their  fundamental  operating  frequencies. 
Fortunately,  regulations  increasingly  restrict  radio  emissions  from  modern  electrical  and 
electronic  systems.   Natural  non-thermal  emission  arises  from  lightning,  solar  bursts,  the  planet 
Jupiter, and other sources. 

11.4  Applications 

11.4.1  Wireless communications systems 

Section  11.4.1  introduces  simple  communications  systems  without  using  Maxwell’s  equations 
and  Section  11.4.2  then  discusses  radar  and  lidar  systems  used  for  surveillance  and  research. 
Optical  communications  is  deferred  to  Chapter  12,  while  the  design,  transformation,  and 
switching of the communications signals themselves are issues left to other texts. 

Wireless  communications  systems  have  a  long  history,  beginning  with  wireless  telegraph 
systems  installed  several  years  after  Hertz’s  laboratory  demonstrations  of  wireless  links  late  in 
the  nineteenth  century.    These  systems  typically  used  line-of-sight  propagation  paths,  and 
sometimes  inter-continental  ionospheric  reflections.    Telephone,  radio,  and  television  systems 
followed.  In  the  mid-twentieth  century,  the  longer  interstate  and  international  wireless  links 
were  almost  entirely  replaced  by  more  capable  and  reliable  coaxial  cables  and  multi-hop 
microwave  links.    These  were  soon  supplemented  by  satellite  links  typically  operating  at 
frequencies up to ~14 GHz; today frequencies up to ~100 GHz are used.  At century’s end, these 
longer  microwave  links  were  then  largely  replaced  again,  this  time  by  optical  fibers  with 
bandwidths  of  Terahertz.  At  the  same  time  many  of  the  shorter  links  are  being  replaced  or 
supplemented  by wireless  cellular  technology, which was made  practical by  the  development  of 

- 359 -


inexpensive  r.f.  integrated  circuits.  Each  technical  advance  markedly  boosted  capacity  and 
market penetration, and generally increased performance and user mobility while reducing costs. 

Most U.S.  homes  and  offices  are  currently  served  by  twisted  pairs  of  telephone wires,  each 
capable  of  conveying  ~50  kbs  -  1.5 Mbps,  although  coaxial  cables,  satellite  links,  and  wireless 
services  are  making  significant  inroads.    The  most  common  wireless  services  currently  include 
cell  phones,  wireless  phones  (within  a  home  or  office),  wireless  internet  connections,  wireless 
intra-home  and  intra-office  connections,  walkie-talkies  (dedicated  mobile  links),  satellite  links, 
microwave  tower  links, and many  specialized variations designed  for private or military use.    In 
addition,  optical  or  microwave  line-of-sight  links  between  buildings  offer  instant  broadband 
connectivity  for  the  “last mile”  to  some users;  the  last mile accounts  for a  significant  fraction of 
all installed plant cost.  Weather generally restricts optical links to very short hops or to weather-
independent  optical  fibers.  Specialized  wireless  medical  devices,  such  as  RF  links  to  video 
cameras inside swallowed pills, are also being developed. 

Broadcast services now  include AM  radio near 1 MHz, FM  radio near 100 MHz and higher 
frequencies, TV in several bands between 50 and 600 MHz for local over-the-air service, and TV 
and radio delivered by satellite at ~4, ~12, and ~20 GHz.   Shortwave radio below ~30 MHz also 
offers global international broadcasts dependent upon ionospheric conditions, and is widely used 
by radio hams for long-distance communications. 

Wireless services are so widespread today that we may take them for granted, forgetting that 
a  few  generations  ago  the  very  concept  of  communicating  by  invisible  silent  radio  waves  was 
considered magic.   Despite  the wide  range  of  services  already  in  use,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume 
that  over  the  next  few  decades  numerous  other  wireless  technologies  and  services  will  be 
developed by today’s engineering students. 

Communications  systems  convey  information  between  two  or  more  nodes,  usually  via 
wires, wireless means, or optical fibers.  After a brief discussion relating signaling rates (bits per 
second)  to  the  signal  power  required  at  the  wireless  receiver,  this  section  discusses  in  general 
terms  the  launching,  propagation,  and  reception  of  electromagnetic  signals  and  messages  in 
wired and wireless systems. 

Information  is  typically measured  in bits.   One bit of  information  is  the  information content 
of  a  single  yes-no  decision,  where  each  outcome  is  equally  likely.    A  string  of M  binary  digits 
(equiprobable  0’s  or  1’s)  conveys  M  bits  of  information.    An  analog  signal  measured  with  an 
accuracy  of  one  part  in  2M  also  conveys  M  bits  because  a  unique  M-bit  binary  number 
corresponds  to  each  discernable  analog  value.    Thus  both  analog  and  digital  signals  can  be 
characterized  in  terms of  the bits of  information  they convey.   All wireless  receivers require  that 
the  energy  received  per  bit  exceed  a  rough  minimum  of  wo  ≅  10-20  Joules/bit,  although  most 
practical systems are orders of magnitude less sensitive.59 

59 Most good communications systems can operate with acceptable probabilities of error  if Eb/No >~10, where Eb  is 
the  energy  per  bit  and  No  =  kT  is  the  noise  power  density  [W  Hz-1]  =  [J].    Boltzmann's  constant  k  ≅  1.38×10-23 
[J oK-1], and T is the system noise temperature, which might approximate 100K in a good system at RF frequencies. 
Thus the nominal minimum energy Eb  required to detect each bit of information is ~10No  ≅ 10-20 [J]. 

- 360 -


To  convey  N  bits  per  second  [b  s-1]  of  information  therefore  requires  that  at  least  ~Nwo 
watts [W] be intercepted by the receiver, and that substantially more power be transmitted.  Note 
that [W] = [J s-1] = [J b-1][b s-1].  Wireless communications is practical because so little power Pr 
is  actually  required  at  the  receiver.  For  example,  to  communicate  100  megabits  per  second 
(Mbps) requires as little as one picowatt (10-12W) at the receiver if wo = 10-20; that is, we require 
Pr > Nwo  ≅ 108×10-20 = 10-12 [W]. 

It  is  fortunate  that  radio  receivers  are  so  sensitive,  because  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  the 
transmitted  power  usually  reaches  them.    In  most  cases  the  path  loss  between  transmitter  and 
receiver  is primarily geometric;  the  radiation  travels  in  straight  lines  away  from  the  transmitting 
antenna with an  intensity  I  [W m-2]  that grows weaker with distance  r as  r-2.  For example,  if  the 
transmitter  is  isotropic  and  radiates  its  power  Pt  equally  in  all  4π  directions,  then  I(θ,φ,r)  = 
Pt/4πr2  [W  m-2].  The  power  Pr  intercepted  by  the  receiving  antenna  is  proportional  to  the 
incident wave  intensity  I(θ,φ)  and  the  receiving  antenna  effective  area A(θ,φ)  [m2],  or  “capture 
cross-section”, where the power Pr received from a plane wave incident from direction θ,φ is: 

Pr

I ( 
, r
, 
= θ φ 

)

,  ) [ 
 

 

(antenna gain) 

(11.4.1) 

The power received from an isotropic transmitting antenna is therefore Pr = (Pt/4πr2)A(θ,φ), so in 
this  special  case  the  line-of-sight  path  loss  between  transmitter  and  receiver  is  Pr/Pt  = 
A(θ,φ)/4πr2,  or  that  fractional  area  of  a  sphere  of  radius  r  represented  by  the  receiving  antenna 
cross-section  A.    Sometimes  additional  propagation  losses  due  to  rain,  gaseous  absorption,  or 
scattering must be recognized too, as discussed in Section 11.3.2. 

In  general,  however,  the  transmitting  antenna  is  not  isotropic,  but  is  designed  to  radiate 
power  preferentially  in  the  direction  of  the  receivers.    We  define  antenna  gain  G(θ,φ),  often 
called “gain over  isotropic”, as  the  ratio of  the  intensity  I(θ,φ,r)  [W m-2] of waves  transmitted  in 
the  direction  θ,φ  (spherical  coordinates)  at  distance  r,  to  the  intensity  that  would  be  transmitted 
by an isotropic antenna.  That is:

(11.4.2) 

If  the  radiated  power  is  conserved,  then  the  integral  of  wave  intensity  over  a  spherical  surface 
enclosing  the antenna  is  independent of  the  sphere’s  radius  r.   Therefore  the angular distribution 
of power and G(θ,φ) plotted  in  spherical coordinates behave much  like a balloon  that must push 
out  somewhere  when  it  is  pushed  inward  somewhere  else,  as  suggested  in  Figure  11.4.1.    The 
maximum  gain Go  often  defines  the  z  axis  and  is  called  the  on-axis  gain.   The  angular width θB 
of  the main beam at  the half-power points where G(θ,φ) ≅ Go/2  is called  the antenna beamwidth 
or  “half-power  beamwidth”.   Other  local  peaks  in  gain  are  called  sidelobes,  and  those  sidelobes 
behind the antenna are often called backlobes.  Angles at which the gain is nearly zero are called 
nulls.

Isotropic and directive antenna gain patterns. 

Antennas with G(θ,φ) >  1  generally  focus  their  radiated  energy  by  using  lenses, mirrors,  or 
multiple radiators phased so their radiated contributions add in phase in the desired direction, and 
largely  cancel  otherwise.  Typical  gains  for  most  wire  antennas  range  from  ~1.5  to  ~100,  and 
large  aperture  antennas  such  as  parabolic  dishes  or  optical  systems  can  have  gains  of  108  or 
more.  The directionality or gain of a mirror or any antenna system is generally the same whether 
it is transmitting or receiving.60  The fundamentals of transmission and reception are presented in 
more detail in Section 10.3.1. 

Consider  the  following  typical  example.  A  television  station  transmits  100  kW  at  ~100 
MHz  toward  the  horizon  with  an  antenna  gain  of  ~10.    Because  the  gain  is  much  greater  than 
unity  in  the  desired  horizontal  direction,  it  is  therefore  less  than  unity  for most  other  downward 
and upward directions where users are either nearby or absent.  The intensity I [W m-2] sensed by 
users on the horizon at 100-km range follows from (11.4.2):

(11.4.3)

Whether  this  intensity  is  sufficient  depends  on  the  properties  of  the  receiving  antenna  and 
receiver.  For  the example of Equation  (11.4.3), a  typical TV antenna with an effective area A ≅ 
2  [m2]  would  capture  IA  ≅  10-5[W/m2]  ×  2[m2]  =  2×10-5  [W].    If  the  received  power  is 
2 ( ) 
5 [W],  and  the  receiver  has  an  input  impedance  R  of  100  ohms,  then  the  root­

 R  ≅ ×10− 
mean-square (rms) voltage  v rms  ≡  v 2 ( )t  0.5 would be (0.002)0.5  ≅ 14 mv, much larger than typical 
noise levels in TV receivers (~10 μv).61 

60 The degree of focus is the same whether the waves are transmitted or received.  That is, if we reverse the direction 
of  time  for  a  valid  electromagnetic  wave  solution  to  Maxwell’s  equations,  the  result  is  also  a  valid  solution  if  the 
system is lossless and reciprocal.  Reciprocity requires that the complex matrices characterizing ε, μ, and σ near the 
antenna  equal  their  own  transposes;  this  excludes  magnetized  plasmas  such  as  the  ionosphere,  and  magnetized 
ferrites, as discussed further in Section 10.3.4. 
61  Typical  TV  receivers might  have  a  superimposed  noise  voltage  of  power N  =  kTB  [W], where  the  system  noise 
temperature  T  might  be  ~104  K  (much  is  interference),  Boltzmann's  constant  k  =  1.38×10-23,  and  B  is  bandwidth 
[Hz].   B ≅ 6 MHz for over-the-air  television.   Therefore N ≅ 1.38×10-23×104×6×106  ≅ 8×10-13  watts, and a good TV 
signal-to-noise ratio S/N of ~104 requires only ~ 8×10-9 watts of signal S.  Since N ≅ nrms 
2/R, the rms noise voltage ≅ 
(NR)0.5, or ~10 μv if the receiver input impedance R = 100 ohms.

Because most antennas are equally  focused whether  they are  receiving or  transmitting,  their 
effective area A(θ,φ) and gain G(θ,φ) are closely related:

Therefore  the  on-axis  gain  Go  =  4πAo/λ2.  This  relation  (11.4.4)  was  proven  for  a  short  dipole 
antenna  in  Section  10.3.3  and  proven  for  other  types  of  antenna  in  Section  10.3.4,  although  the 
proof  is  not  necessary  here.   This  relation  is  often  useful  in  estimating  the  peak  gain  of  aperture 
antennas  like  parabolic  mirrors  or  lenses  because  their  peak  effective  area  Ao  often  approaches 
their physical cross-section Ap within a factor of two; typically Ao  ≅ 0.6 Ap.  This approximation 
does  not  apply  to wire  antennas,  however. Thus we  can  easily  estimate  the  on-axis  gain  of  such 
aperture antennas:

where  Gt  is  the  gain  of  the  transmitting  antenna  and  Ar  is  the  effective  area  of  the  receiving 
antenna.  The data rate R associated with this received power is : R = Pr/Eb [bits s-1]. 

A  second  example  illustrates  how  a  communications  system  might  work.    Consider  a 
geosynchronous  communications  satellite62  transmitting  12-GHz  high-definition  television 
(HDTV)  signals  at  20  Mbps  to  homes  with  1-meter  dishes,  and  assume  the  satellite  antenna 
spreads  its  power  Pt  roughly  equally  over  the  eastern  United  States,  say  3×106  km2.  Then  the 
intensity  of  the waves  falling  on  the U.S.  is:  I  ≅ Pt/(3×1012)  [W m-2],  and  the  power  Pr  received 
by an antenna with effective area Ao  ≅ 0.6 [m2] is:

(11.4.8) 

The  equality  of  the  right-hand  parts  of  (11.4.7)  and  (11.4.8)  reveals  that  one watt  of  transmitter 
power Pt in this satellite could send a digital HDTV signal to all the homes and businesses in the 

62 A  satellite approximately 35,000 km above  the equator circles  the earth  in 24 hours at  the  same  rate at which  the 
earth  rotates,  and  therefore  can  remain  effectively  stationary  in  the  sky  as  a  communications  terminal  serving 
continental areas.  Such satellites are called “geostationary” or “geosynchronous”.

eastern  U.S.  Since  a  20-dB  margin63  for  rain  attenuation,  noisy  receivers,  smaller  or  poorly 
pointed home antennas, etc. is desirable, 100-watt transmitters might be used in practice. 

We  can  also  estimate  the  physical  area  Ap  of  the  aperture  antenna  on  the  satellite.    If  we 
know Pt and I at the earth, then we can determine the satellite gain G using I = GPt/4πr2 (11.4.2), 
where  r  ≅  40,000  km  in  the  northern  U.S;  here  we  have  I  ≅  3.3×10-12  when  Pt  =  1  watt.    The 
wavelength λ at 12 GHz is 2.5 cm (λ = c/f). But Ap  ≅ 1.5Ao, where Ao is related to G by (11.4.4). 
Therefore we obtain the reasonable result that a 2.5-meter diameter parabolic dish on the satellite 
should suffice: 
A p  ≅ 1.5A o  = (1.5 λ  4π)G = (1.5λ  4π)(4πr   I P )  ≅ 5 ⎣⎡m  ⎦

(11.4.9)

The same result could have been obtained by determining the angular extent of the U.S. coverage 
area  as  seen  from  the  satellite  and  then,  as  discussed  in  Section  11.1.2,  determining  what 
diameter antenna would have a diffraction pattern with that same beamwidth. 

Thus we can design digital communications systems for a data rate R [b s-1] if we know the 
range  r, wavelength  λ,  and  receiver  sensitivity  (Joules  required  per  bit).   For  analog  systems we 
also need  to know  the desired signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR) at  the  receiver and  the noise power N. 
Table 11.4.1 lists typical data rates R for various applications, and Table 11.4.2 lists typical SNR 
values required for various types of analog signal.

Example 11.4A 
A parabolic reflector antenna of 2-meter diameter  transmits Pt = 10 watts at 3 GHz  from beyond 
the  edge  of  the  solar  system  (R  ≅  1010  km)  to  a  similar  antenna  on  earth  of  50-m  diameter  at  a 
maximum data rate N bits/sec.  What is N if the receiver requires 10-20 Joules bit-1? 

Solution:	 Recall  that  the  on-axis  effective  area  A  of  a  circular  aperture  antenna  equals  ~0.6 
times  its  physical  area  (πr2),  and  it  has  gain  G  =  4πA/λ2  =  (2πr/λ)2.  The  received

11.4.2  Radar and lidar 

Radar  (RAdio  Direction  and  Range  finding)  and  lidar  (LIght  Direction  and  Range  finding) 
systems transmit signals toward targets of interest and receive echoes.  They typically determine: 
1)  target  distance  using  the  round-trip  propagation  delay,  2)  target  direction  using  echo  strength 
relative  to  antenna  orientation,  3)  target  radial  velocity  using  the  observed Doppler  shift,  and  4) 
target  size  or  scattering  properties  using  the  maximum  echo  strength.    Figure  11.4.2  illustrates 
the most common radar configuration.

65 For digital signals the dimensionless signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) given here is the energy-per-bit Eb divided by the 
noise power density No [W Hz-1], where No  = kT and T is the noise temperature, say 100-104K typically.  For analog 
signals, S and N are the total signal and noise powers, respectively, where N = kTB and B is signal bandwidth [Hz].

To compute  the received power, we first compute  the  intensity It of radiation at the target at 
range r for a transmitter power and antenna gain of Pt and G, respectively:

⎡⎣  W/m  

(intensity at radar)  (11.4.11)

where  σs  is  the  scattering  cross-section  of  the  target  and  is  defined  by  (11.4.11).  That  is,  σs  is 
the  capture  cross-section  [m2]  at  the  target  that  would  produce  Ir  if  the  target  scattered  incident 
radiation  isotropically.    Thus  targets  that  preferentially  scatter  radiation  toward  the  transmitter 
can have scattering cross-sections substantially larger than their physical cross-sections. 

The  received  power  Pr  is  then  simply  IrAr  [W],  where  Ar  is  the  effective  area  of  the 
receiving antenna.  That is:

dependence of received power on the fourth power of range and the square of antenna gain often 
control radar system design. 

(radar equation)  (11.4.13)

Atmospheric  attenuation  is  often  included  in  the  radar  equation  by  means  of  a  round-trip 
attenuation  factor  e-2αr, where α  is  the  average  atmospheric  attenuation  coefficient  (m-1)  and  r  is 
range.  Atmospheric  attenuation  is  discussed  in  Section  11.3.2  and  below  200  GHz  is  due 
principally  to oxygen, water vapor, and  rain;  it  is usually not  important below ~3 GHz.   Oxygen 
absorption  occurs  primarily  in  the  lowest  10  km  of  the  atmosphere  ~50-70  GHz  and  near  118 
GHz, water  vapor  absorption  occurs  primarily  in  the  lowest  3  km  of  the  atmosphere  above  ~10 
GHz, and rain absorption occurs up to ~15 km in the largest rain cells above ~3 GHz. 

Lidar systems also obey the radar equation, but aerosol scattering by clouds, haze, or smoke 
becomes more of a concern.  Also the phase fronts of optical beams are more easily disturbed by 
refractive  inhomogeneities  in  the  atmosphere  that  can  modulate  received  echoes  on  time  scales 
of milliseconds with random fading of ten dB or more. 

A simple example  illustrates use of  the radar equation (11.4.13).   Suppose we wish  to know 
the  range  r  at  which  we  can  detect  dangerous  asteroids  having  diameters  over  ~300m  that  are 

- 366 -


approaching the earth.  Assume the receiver has additive noise characterized by the system noise 
temperature Ts,  and  that  the  radar  bandwidth  is  one Hertz  because  the  received  sinusoid will  be 
averaged for approximately one second.  Detectable radar echos must have Pr > kTsB [W], where 
k is Boltzmann's constant (k = 1.38×10-23) and B is the system bandwidth (~1 Hz); this implies Pr 
≅ 1.4×10-23 Ts watts.  We can estimate σs for a 300-meter asteroid by assuming it reflects roughly 
as well as the earth, say fifteen percent, and that the scattering is roughly isotropic; then σs  ≅ 104 
[m2].  If  we  further  assume  our  radar  is  using  near  state-of-the-art  components,  then  we  might 
have Pt  ≅ 1 Mw, Gt  ≅ 108, λ = 0.1 m, and Ts  ≅ 10K.  The radar equation then yields:

(11.4.14)

This  range  is  about  one-third  of  the  distance  to  the  sun  and  would  provide  about  2-3  weeks 
warning. 

Optical  systems  with  a  large  aperture  area  A  might  perform  this  task  better  because  their 
antenna gain G = A4π/λ2, and λ  for  lidar  is  typically 10-5  that of a common  radar.  For antennas 
of the same physical aperture and transmitter power, 1-micron lidar has an advantage over 10-cm 
radar of ~1010 in Pr/Pt. 

Radar  suffers  because  of  its  dependence  on  the  fourth  power  of  range  for  targets  smaller 
than the antenna beamwidth.   If the radar can place all of its transmitted energy on target, then it 
suffers  only  the  range-squared  loss  of  the  return  path.    The  ability  of  lidar  systems  to  strongly 
focus  their  transmitting  beam  totally  onto  a  small  target  often  enables  their  operation  in  the 
highly advantageous r-2 regime rather than r-4. 

Equations  (11.4.13)  and  (11.4.14)  can  easily  be  revised  for  the  case  where  all  the  radar 
energy intercepts the target.  The radar equation then becomes: 

 RG  λ π 4 r )2  [
( 
P  = P

r

]W 

(11.4.15)

where  the  target  retro-reflectivity  R  is  defined  by  (11.4.15)  and  is  the  dimensionless  ratio  of 
back-scattered  radiation  intensity  at  the  radar  to  what  would  be  back  scattered  if  the  radiation 
were scattered isotropically by the target.  For the same assumptions used before, asteroids could 
be  detected  at  a  range  r  of  ~3×1012  km  if  R  ≅  0.2,  a  typical  value  for  icy  rock.    The  implied 
detection distance  is now dramatically  farther  than before, and  reaches outside our  solar  system. 
However,  the  requirement  that  the  entire  radar  beam  hit  the  asteroid  would  be  essentially 
impossible even for the very best optical systems, so this approach to boosting detection range is 
usually not practical for probing small distant objects. 

Radar systems often use phased arrays of antenna elements, as discussed  in Section 10.4,  to 
focus  their  energy  on  small  spots  or  to  look  in more  than  one  direction  at  once.    In  fact  a  single 
moving  radar  system,  on  an  airplane  for  example,  can  coherently  receive  sequential  reflected 
radar  pulses  and  digitally  reassemble  the  signal  over  some  time  period  so  as  to  synthesize  the 
equivalent of a phased array antenna that is far larger than the physical antenna.   That  is, a small 

- 367 -


receiving  antenna  can  be  moved  over  a  much  larger  area  A,  and  by  combining  its  received 
signals  from  different  locations  in  a  phase-coherent  way,  can  provide  the  superior  angular 
resolution  associated  with  area  A.    This  is  called  synthetic  aperture  radar  (SAR)  and  is  not 
discussed further here. 

Example 11.4B 
A  radar  with  1-GHz  bandwidth  and  40-dB  gain  at  10  GHz  views  the  sun,  which  has  angular 
diameter  0.5 degrees  and  brightness  temperature  TB  =  10,000K.  Roughly  what  is  the  antenna 
temperature  TA  and  the  power  received  by  the  radar  from  the  sun  if  we  ignore  any  radar 
reflections? 

Solution:	 The power  received  is  the  intensity at  the antenna port  I  [W/Hz]  times  the bandwidth 
B  [Hz],  where  I  ≅  kTA  (11.3.1),  and  TA  is  the  antenna  temperature  given  by  the 
integral  in  (11.3.4).   This  integral  is  trivial  if G(θ,φ)  is  nearly  constant  over  the  solid 
angle ΩS of  the sun;  then TA  ≅  GoTBΩS/4π.  Constant gain across the sun requires the 
antenna beamwidth θB >> 0.5 degrees.  We can roughly estimate θB by approximating 
the  antenna  gain  as  a  constant  Go  over  solid  angle  ΩB,  and  zero  elsewhere;  then 
∫4π  G(θ,φ)dΩ  =  4π  =  GoΩB  =  104ΩB. 
(10.3.3)  yields 
 
Therefore 
ΩB  ≅  4π/104  ≅ π(θB/2)2,  and  θB  ≅  0.04  radians  ≅  2.3  degrees,  which  is  marginally 
greater  than  the  solar  diameter  required  for  use  of  the  approximation  θB  >>  0.5  in  a 
rough  estimate.    It  follows  that  TA  ≅  GoTBΩS/4π  =  104×104× π(θS/2)2/4π ≅ 
480  degrees  Kelvin,  somewhat  larger  than  the  noise  temperature  of  good  receivers. 
The power received is kTAB ≅ 1.38×10-23×480×109  ≅ 6.6×10-12 watts.  This is a slight 
overestimate because the gain is actually slightly less than Go at the solar limb. 

Example 11.4C 
What  is  the  scattering  cross-section  σs  of  a  small  distant  flat  plate  of  area  F  oriented  so  as  to 
reflect incident radiation directly back toward the transmitter? 

Solution:	 The  radar  equation  (11.4.12)  relates  the  transmitted  power  Pt  to  that  received,  Pr,  in 
terms of σs.  A similar relation can be derived by treating the power reflected from the 
flat  plate  as  though  it  came  from  an  aperture  uniformly  illuminated  with  intensity 
PtGt/4πr2  [W m-2].  The  power Pr  received  by  the  radar  is  then  the  power  radiated  by 
the flat-plate aperture, FPtGt/4πr2 [W], inserted as Pt into the link expression (11.4.6): 
Pr =  (FPtGt/4πr2)GfAr/4πr2.  The gain of  the  flat plate aperture  is Gf = F4π/λ2, and Ar 
= Gλ2/4π,  so GfAr = GF.  Equating Pr  in  this  expression  to  that  in  the  radar  equation 
yields:  Ptσs(Gλ/4πr2)2/4π  =  (FPtGt/4πr2)GF/4πr2,  so σs  =  F(4πF/λ2).  Note σs  >>  F  if 
F  >>  λ2/4π.  Corner  reflectors  (three  flat  plates  at  right  angles  intersecting  so  as  to 
form one corner of a cube) reflect plane waves directly back toward their source if the 
waves  impact  the  concave  portion  of  the  reflector  from  any  angle.    Therefore  the 
corner  reflector becomes  a very  area-efficient  radar  target  if  its  total projected  area F 
is larger than λ2.

12.1 

Introduction to optical communication links 

12.1.1  Introduction to optical communications and photonics 

Optical  communications  is  as  ancient  as  signal  fires  and  mirrors  reflecting  sunlight,  but  it  is 
rapidly  being  modernized  by  photonics  that  integrate  optics  and  electronics  in  single  devices. 
Photonic  systems  are  usually  analyzed  in  terms  of  individual  photons,  although  wave  methods 
still  characterize  the  guidance  of  waves  through  optical  fibers,  space,  or  other  media.    This 
chapter introduces optical communications and applications of photonics in Section 12.1.  It then 
discusses  simple  optical  waveguides  in  Section  12.2,  lasers  in  Section  12.3,  and  representative 
components  of  optical  communications  systems  in  Sections  12.4,  including  photodetectors  in 
12.4.1-2, multiplexers in 12.4.3, interferometers in 12.4.4, and optical switches in 12.4.5. 

12.1.2  Applications of photonics 

Perhaps  the  single  most  important  application  of  photonics  today  is  to  optical  communications 
through  low-loss glass  fibers.   Since 1980  this development has dramatically  transformed global 
communications.  The  advantage  of  an  optical  fiber  for  communications  is  that  it  has  a 
bandwidth  of  approximately  one  terahertz,  and  can  propagate  signals  over  continental  and  even 
global  distances  when  assisted  by  optical  amplifiers.    These  amplifiers  are  currently  separated 
more than ~80 km, and this separation is steadily increasing as technology improves.  In contrast, 
coaxial  cable,  wire-pair,  and  wireless  links  at  radio  frequencies  still  dominate  most 
communication paths of bandwidth < ~2 MHz, provided the length is less than ~1–50 km. 

One broadband global wireless alternative  to optics  is microwave communications satellites 
in geosynchronous orbit66 that can service ships at sea and provide moveable capacity addressing 
transient  communications  shortfalls  or  failures  across  the  globe;  the  satellites  simply  point  their 
antenna beams at the new users, who can be over 10,000 km apart.  The greatest use of satellites, 
however,  is  for  broadcast  of  entertainment  over  continental  areas,  either  to  end-users  or  to  the 
head ends of cable distribution systems.  In general, the limited terrestrial radio spectrum is more 
efficiently  used  for  broadcast  than  for  one-to-one  communications  unless  there  is  re-use  of 
spectrum  as  described  in  Section  10.4.6.    Optical  techniques  are  disadvantaged  for  satellite-
ground  links  or  ground-to-ground  links  through  air  because  of  clouds  and  fog,  which  restrict 
such links to very short distances or to cases where spatial diversity67 offers clear-air alternatives. 

Optical  links  also  have  great  potential  for  very  broadband  inter-satellite  or  diversity-
protected  satellite-earth  communications  because  small  telescopes  easily  provide  highly  focused 
antenna  beams.    For  example,  beamwidths  of  telescopes with  5-inch  apertures  are  typically  one 

66 Geosynchronous satellites at 22,753-mile altitude orbit Earth once every 24 hours and can therefore hover  

stationary in the sky if they are in an equatorial orbit.  

67  Spatial  diversity  involves  use  of  spatially  distinct  communications  links  that  suffer  any  losses  independently;  

combining these signals in non-linear ways improves overall message reliability.

arc-second68,  corresponding  to  antenna  gains  of  ~4π×(57×3600)2  ≅  5×1011,  approximately  5000 
times  greater  than  is  achievable  by  all  but  the  very  best  radio  telescopes.   Such  optical  links  are 
discussed in Section 12.1.4. 

Optical  fibers  are  increasingly  being  used  for  much  shorter  links  too,  simply  because  their 
useable  bandwidth  can  readily  be  expanded  after  installation  and  because  they  are  cheaper  for 
larger bandwidths.   The distance between  successive  amplifiers  can  also be orders of magnitude 
greater  (compare  the  fiber  losses  of  Figure  12.2.6  with  those  of  wires,  as  discussed  in  Section 
7.1.4  and  Section  8.3.1).  The  bandwidth  per wire  is  generally  less  than  ~0.1 GHz  for  distances 
between  amplifiers  of  1  km,  whereas  a  single  optical  fiber  can  convey  ~1  THz  for  100  km  or 
more.  Extreme data  rates are now also being conveyed optically between and within computers 
and  even  chips,  although  wires  still  have  advantages  of  cost  and  simplicity  for  most  ultra-short 
and high-power applications. 

Optical  communication  is  not  the  only  application  for  photonics,  however.    Low-power 
lasers  are  used  in  everyday  devices  ranging  from  classroom  pointers  and  carpenters’  levels  to 
bar-code  readers,  laser  copiers  and  printers,  surgical  tools,  medical  and  environmental 
instruments, and DVD players and recorders.  Laser pulses lasting only 10-15 second (0.3 microns 
length)  are  used  for  biological  and  other  research.    High  power  lasers  with  tens  of  kilowatts  of 
average  power  are  used  for  cutting  and  other  manufacturing  purposes,  and  lasers  that  release 
their  stored  energy  in  sub-picosecond  intervals  can  focus  and  compress  their  energy  to  achieve 
intensities of ~1023 W/m2  for  research or,  for example,  to drive small  thermonuclear  reactions  in 
compressed  pellets.   Moreover,  new  applications  are  constantly  being  developed with  no  end  in 
sight. 

12.1.3  Link equations 

The link equations governing through-the-air optical communications are essentially the same as 
those  governing  radio,  as  described  in  Section  10.3.    That  is,  the  received  power  Pr  is  simply 
related  to  the  transmitted  power  Pt  by  the  gain  and  effective  area  of  the  transmitting  and 
receiving antennas, Gt and Ae: 

P  = (G P

(optical link equation)

The  gain  and  effective  area  of  single-mode  optical  antennas  are  related  by  the  same  equation 
governing radio waves, (10.3.23): 

G 4 A= π  λ 2 

(12.1.2) 

Some optical detectors intercept multiple independent waves or modes, and their powers add.  In 
this  case,  the  gain  and  effective  area  of  any  single  mode  are  then  less  relevant,  as  discussed  in 
Section 12.1.4. 

68 One arc-second is 1/60 arc-minutes, 1/602 degrees, 1/(57.3×3600) radians, or 1/60 of the largest apparent 
diameters of Venus or Jupiter in the night sky.

The maximum bit rate that can be communicated over an optical link is not governed by the 
Eb  >  ~10-20  Joules-per-bit  limit  characteristic  of  radio  systems,  however,  but  rather  by  the 
number  of  photons  the  receiver  requires  per  bit  of  information,  perhaps  ~10  for  a  typical  good 
system.    Each  photon  has  energy  E  =  hf  Joules.    Thus  to  receive  R  bits/second  might  require 
received power of: 

P  = E R  ≅ 10hfR  [W] 
r
b 

(optical rate approximation) 

(12.1.3)

where  h  is  Planck’s  constant  (6.624×10-34)  and  f  is  photon  frequency  [Hz].    Clever  design  can 
enable many bits to be communicated per photon, as discussed in the following section. 

12.1.4  Examples of optical communications systems 

Three  examples  illustrate  several  of  the  issues  inherent  in  optical  communications  systems:  a 
trans-oceanic  optical  fiber  cable,  an  optical  link  to  Mars,  and  an  incoherent  intra-office  link 
carrying computer information. 

First consider a trans-oceanic optical fiber.  Section 12.2.2 discusses losses in optical fibers, 
which can be as  low as ~0.2 dB/km near 1.5-micron wavelength  (f ≅  2×1014 Hz).   To ensure  the  
signal (zeros and ones) remains unambiguous, each link of an R = 1-Gbps fiber link must deliver 
to  its  receiver  or  amplifier  more  than  ~10hfR  watts,  or  ~10×6×10-34×2×1014×109  ≅  1.2×10-9 
watts; a more  typical design might deliver ~10-6 watts because errors accumulate and equipment 
can degrade.  If one watt  is  transmitted and10-6 watts  is  received,  then  the associated 60-dB  loss 
corresponds  to  300  km  of  fiber  propagation  between  optical  amplifiers,  and  perhaps  ~20 
amplifiers  across  the  Atlantic  Ocean  per  fiber.    In  practice,  erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers, 
discussed in Section 12.3.1, are now spaced approximately 80 km apart. 

Next  consider  an  optical  link  communicating  between  Earth  and  astronauts  on  Mars. 
Atmospheric diffraction or “seeing” limits the focusing ability of terrestrial telescopes larger than 
~10  cm,  but  Mars  has  little  atmosphere.    Therefore  a  Martian  optical  link  might  employ  the 
equivalent  of  a  one-square-meter  optical  telescope  on Mars  and  the  equivalent  of  10-cm-square 
optics  on  Earth.    It  might  also  employ  a  one-watt  laser  transmitter  on  Earth  operating  at  0.5­
micron  wavelength,  in  the  visible  region.    The  nominal  link  and  rate  equations,  (12.1.1)  and 
(12.1.3), yield the maximum data rate R possible at a range of ~1011 meters (approximate closest 
approach of Mars to Earth): 

R = P E  ≅ (G P  4 πr  )A  10hf  [bits s  ]

(12.1.4)

The gain Gt of the transmitter given by (12.1.2) is Gt  ≅ 4πA/λ2  ≅ 5×1011, where A ≅ (0.1)2 and λ 
≅ 5×10-7 [m].  The frequency f = c/λ = 3×108/[5×10-7] = 6×1014.  Therefore (12.1.4) becomes: 
R ≅ { 5 ×10  ×1  ⎣4π 10
⎦} {  1  10 × 6.624 ×10  × 6 ×10  } ≅ 1 Mbps

(12.1.5)

Table 11.4.1 suggests  that  this data rate  is adequate for full-motion video of modest quality. 
The  delay  of  the  signal  each  way  is  τ  =  r/c  =  1011/[3×108]  seconds  ≅  5.6  minutes,  impeding 
conversation.  This  delay  becomes  several  times  greater when Mars  is  on  the  far  side  of  the  sun 
from Earth, and the data rate R would then drop by more than a factor of ten. 

This  1-Mbps  result  (12.1.5)  assumed  10  photons  were  required  per  bit  of  information. 
However  this  can  be  reduced  below  one  photon  per  bit  by  using  pulse-position  modulation. 
Suppose ~106  1-nsec  10-photon  pulses were  received  per  second, where  each  pulse  could  arrive 
in any of 1024  time slots because  the ratio of pulse width to average inter-pulse spacing  is 1024. 
This timing information conveys ten bits of  information per pulse because  log21024 = 10.  Since 
each 10-photon pulse conveys 10 bits of  information,  the average  is one bit per photon received. 
With  more  time  slots  still  fewer  photons  per  bit  would  be  required.    If  a  tunable  laser  can 
transmit each pulse at any of 1024 colors, for example, then another factor of 10 can be achieved.  
Use  of  both  pulse  position  and  pulse-frequency  modulation  can  permit  more  than  10  bits  to  be 
communicated per photon on average. 

The final example is that of a 1-mW laser diode transmitting digitally modulated light at λ = 
5×10-7 [m] isotropically within a large office over ranges r up to 10 meters, where the light might 
travel  directly  to  the  isotropic  receiver  or  bounce  off  walls  and  the  ceiling  first.    Such  optical 
communications  systems  might  link  computers,  printers,  personal  digital  assistants  (pda’s),  and 
other  devices  within  the  room.    In  this  case  Gt  =  1  and  Ae  =  Gλ2/4π  =  (5×10-7)2/4π ≅  2×10-14 
[m2].  The maximum data rate R can again be found using (12.1.4): 
 4π10  )(2×10

The  fact  that  we  can  send  106  bits  per  second  to  Mars  with  a  one-watt  transmitter,  but  only  4 
millibits per second across a room with a milliwatt, may conflict with intuition. 

(12.1.6) 

The  resolution  of  this  seeming  paradox  lies  in  the  assumption  that  the  receiver  in  this 
example  is  a  single  mode  device  like  that  of  typical  radio  receivers  or  the  Martian  optical 
receiver considered above.  If this room-link receiver were isotropic and intercepted only a single 
mode,  its  effective  area  Ae  given  by  (12.1.2)  would  be  2×10-14  [m2].  The  tiny  effective  area  of 
such  low-gain  coherent  optical  antennas  motivates  use  of  incoherent  photodetectors  instead, 
which  respond  well  to  the  total  photon  flux  from  all  directions  of  arrival.    For  example,  intra-
room  optical  links  of  this  type  are  commonly  used  for  remote  control  of  many  consumer 
electronic  devices,  but  with  a  much  larger  multimode  antenna  (photodiode)  of  area 
A  ≅  2×10-6  [m2]  instead  of  2×10-14.  This  “antenna”  is  typically  responsive  to  all  photons 
impacting  its  area  that  arrive  within  roughly  one  steradian.    That  is,  a  photodetector  generally 
intercepts  all  photons  impacting  it,  even  though  those  photons  are  incoherent  with  each  other. 
Thus  the  solution  (12.1.6)  is  increased  by  a  factor  of  10-6/10-14  if  a  two-square-millimeter 
photodetector  replaces  the  single-mode  antenna,  and  R  then  becomes  0.4 Mbps,  which  is  more 
capacity  than  normally  required.    In  practice  such  inexpensive  area  detectors  are  noisier  and 
require  orders  of  mangitude  more  photons  per  bit.    Better  semiconductor  detectors  can  achieve 
10  photons  per  bit  or  better,  however,  particularly  at  visible  wavelengths  and  if  stray  light  at 
other wavelengths is filtered out.

12.2  Optical waveguides 

12.2.1  Dielectric slab waveguides 

Optical  waveguides  such  as  optical  fibers  typically  trap  and  guide  light  within  rectangular  or 
cylindrical  boundaries  over  useful  distances.    Rectangular  shapes  are  easier  to  implement  on 
integrated circuits, while cylindrical shapes are used for  longer distances, up  to 100 km or more. 
Exact  wave  solutions  for  such  structures  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  text,  but  the  same  basic 
principles  are  evident  in  dielectric  slab  waveguides  for  which  the  derivations  are  simpler. 
Dielectric  slab  waveguides  consist  of  an  infinite  flat  dielectric  slab  of  thickness  2d  and 
permittivity  ε  imbedded  in  an  infinite  medium  of  lower  permittivity  εo,  as  suggested  in  Figure 
12.2.1(a)  for  a  slab  of  finite  width  in  the  y  direction.    For  simplicity  we  here  assume  μ  =  μo 
everywhere, which is usually the case in practice too.

Figure 12.2.1  Dielectric slab waveguide and TE mode structure. 
 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.2.3,  uniform  plane  waves  within  the  dielectric  are  perfectly 
reflected at the slab boundary if they are incident beyond the critical angle θc = sin-1(cε/co), where 
cε  and  co  are  the velocities of  light  in  the dielectric  and outside,  respectively.    Such  a wave  and 
 
its  perfect  reflection  propagate  together  along  the  z  axis  and  form  a  standing  wave  in  the 
orthogonal  x  direction.  Outside  the  waveguide  the  waves  are  evanescent  and  decay 
exponentially away from the guide, as illustrated in Figure 12.2.2.  This figure portrays the fields 
inside and outside the lower half of a dielectric slab having ε > εo; the lower boundary is at x = 0.  
The  figure  suggests  two possible positions  for  the upper  slab boundary  that  satisfy  the boundary 
conditions for the TE1 and TE2 modes.  Note that the TE1 mode waveguide can be arbitrarily thin 
relative  to  λ  and  still  satisfy  the  boundary  conditions.  The  field  configurations  above  the  upper 
boundary  mirror  the  fields  below  the  lower  boundary,  but  are  not  illustrated  here.    These 
waveguide modes are designated TEn because the electric field is only transverse to the direction 
of  propagation,  and  there  is  part  of  n  half-wavelengths  within  the  slab.    The  orthogonal  modes 
(not illustrated) are designated TMn.

Figure 12.2.2  Fields in dielectric slab waveguides for TEn modes. 
 

The  fields  inside  a  dielectric  slab  waveguide  have  the  same  form  as  (9.3.6)  and  (9.3.7)  inside 
parallel-plate  waveguides,  although  the  boundary  positions  are  different;  also  see  Figures  9.3.1 
and  9.3.3.  If  we  define  x  =  0  at  the  axis  of  symmetry,  and  the  thickness  of  the  guide  to  be  2d, 
then within the guide the electric field for TE modes is:

The  TE1 mode  has  the  interesting  property  that  it  approaches  TEM  behavior  as ω → 0  and 
the  decay  length  approaches  infinity;  most  of  the  energy  is  then  propagating  outside  the  slab 
even  though  the  mode  is  guided  by  it.    Modes  with  n  ≥  2  have  non-zero  cut-off  frequencies. 
There is no TM mode that propagates for f→0 in dielectric slab waveguides, however.   

Although Figure 12.2.1(a) portrays a slab with an insulating medium outside, the first option 
in brackets {•} for  the field solutions above  is also consistent for x > 0 with a slab  located 0 < x 
<  d  and  having  a  perfectly  conducting wall  at  x =  0;  all  boundary  conditions  are matched;  these 
are  the  anti-symmetric  TE  modes.    This  configuration  corresponds,  for  example,  to  certain 
optical guiding structures overlaid on conductive semiconductors. 

To  complete  the  TE  field  solutions  above  we  need  additional  relations  between  Eo  and  E1, 
and  between  kx  and  α.  Matching  E   at  x  =  d  for  the  symmetric  solution  [cos  kxx  in  (12.2.1)] 
yields:

Figure 12.2.3  TE modes for a dielectric slab waveguide. 
 

Note  that  the TE1 mode can be trapped and propagate at all frequencies, from nearly zero to 
infinity.  At low frequencies the waves guided by the slab have small values of α and decay very 
slowly  away  from  the  slab  so  that  most  of  the  energy  is  actually  propagating  in  the  z  direction 
outside  the  slab  rather  than  inside.    The  value  of  α  can  be  found  from  (12.2.12),  and  it 
approaches zero as both kxd and ω approach zero. 

The  TE3  mode  cannot  propagate  near  zero  frequency  however.    Its  cutoff  frequency  ωTE3 
 
occurs when kxd = π, as suggested by Figure 12.2.3; ωTE3 can be determined by solving (12.2.12) 
for  this  case.  This  and  all  higher modes  cannot  be  trapped  at  low  frequencies  because  then  the 
plane waves  that comprise  them  impact the slab wall at angles beyond θc  that permit escape.   As 
ω  increases,  more  modes  can  propagate.    Figures  12.2.2  and  12.2.1(b)  illustrate  symmetric  TE1 
and TE3 modes,  and  the  antisymmetric TE2 mode.   Similar  figures  could  be  constructed  for TM 
modes. 

These  solutions  for dielectric-slab waveguides are  similar  to  the  solutions  for optical  fibers, 
which  instead  take  the  form  of  Bessel  functions  because  of  their  cylindrical  geometry.    In  both 
cases  we  have  lateral  standing  waves  propagating  inside  and  evanescent  waves  propagating 
outside. 

12.2.2  Optical fibers 

An  optical  fiber  is  generally  a  very  long  solid  glass  wire  that  traps  lightwaves  inside  as  do  the 
dielectric slab waveguides described in Section 12.2.1.  Fiber lengths can be tens of kilometers or 

- 376 -


more.    Because  the  fiber  geometry  is  cylindrical,  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  inside  and 
outside  the  fiber  are  characterized  by  Bessel  functions,  which  we  do  not  address  here.  These 
propagating  electromagnetic  fields  exhibit  lateral  standing  waves  inside  the  fiber  and 
evanescence outside.   To minimize  loss  the fiber core  is usually overlaid with a  low-permittivity 
glass cladding so that the evanescent decay also occurs within low-loss glass. 

A  typical  glass  optical  fiber  transmission  line  is  perhaps  125  microns  in  diameter  with  a 
high-permittivity  glass  core  having  diameter  ~6  microns.    The  core  permittivity  ε  +  Δε  is 
typically  ~2  percent  greater  than  that  of  the  cladding    (ε).    If  the  lightwaves  within  the  core 
impact the cladding beyond the critical angle θc, where:

θ = sin −  (ε  ε + Δε  ) 
)

(12.2.14)

then  these waves  are  perfectly  reflected  and  trapped.   The  evanescent waves  inside  the  cladding 
decay approximately exponentially away from  the core  to negligible values at  the outer cladding 
boundary, which is often encased in plastic about 0.1 mm thick that may be reinforced.  Graded-
index fibers have a graded transition in permittivity between  the core and cladding.   Some fibers 
propagate  multiple  modes  that  travel  at  different  velocities  so  as  to  interfere  at  the  output  and 
limit information extraction (data rate).  Multiple fibers are usually bundled inside a single cable.

Figure 12.2.5 shows four common forms of optical fiber; many others exist.  The multimode 
fiber is thicker and propagates several modes, while the single-mode fiber is so thin that only one 
mode can propagate.  The diameter of the core determines the number of propagating modes.  In 
all  cylindrical  structures,  even  single-mode  fibers,  both  vertically  and  horizontally  polarized 
waves can propagate independently and therefore may interfere with each other when detected at 
the output.  If a single-mode fiber has an elliptical cross-section, one polarization can be made to 
escape so  the signal becomes pure.   That  is, one polarization decays more slowly away  from  the 
core so that it sees more of the absorbing material that surrounds the cladding.

The  initial  issue  faced  in  the  1970’s  by  designers  of  optical  fibers  was  propagation  loss. 
Most  serious  was  absorption  due  to  residual  levels  of  impurities  in  the  glass,  so  much  research 
and  development  involved  purification.    Water  posed  a  particularly  difficult  problem  because 
one  of  its  harmonics  fell  in  the  region  where  attenuation  in  glass  was  otherwise  minimum,  as 
suggested in Figure 12.2.6.

Figure 12.2.6  Loss mechanisms in optical fibers. 
 

At wavelengths shorter than ~1.5 microns the losses are dominated by Rayleigh scattering of the 
waves  from  the  random  fluctuations  in  glass  density  on  atomic  scales.    These  scattered  waves 
exit  the  fiber  at  angles  less  than  the  critical  angle.    Rayleigh  scattering  is  proportional  to  f4  and 
occurs  when  the  inhomogeneities  in  ε  are  small  compared  to  λ/2π.  Inhomogeneities  in  glass 
fibers have near-atomic scales, say 1 nm, whereas the wavelength is more than 1000 times larger. 
Rayleigh scattering losses are reduced by minimizing unnecessary inhomogeneities through glass 
purification and careful mixing, and by decreasing the critical angle.  Losses due to scattering by 
rough  fiber  walls  are  small  because  drawn  glass  fibers  can  be  very  smooth  and  little  energy 
impacts the walls. 

At  wavelengths  longer  than  ~1.5  microns  the  wings  of  infrared  absorption  lines  at  lower 
frequencies  begin  to  dominate.    This  absorption  is  due  principally  to  the  vibration  spectra  of 
inter-atomic  bonds,  and  is  unavoidable.    The  resulting  low-attenuation  band  centered  near  1.5­
microns  between  the Rayleigh  and  IR  attenuating  regions  is  about  20 THz wide,  sufficient  for  a 
single fiber to provide each person in the U.S.A. with a bandwidth of 20×1012/2.5×108 = 80 kHz, 
or  15  private  telephone  channels!  Most  fibers  used  for  local  distribution  do  not  operate 
anywhere  close  to  this  limit  for  lack  of  demand,  although  some  undersea  cables  are  pushing 
toward it. 

The  fibers  are  usually  manufactured  first  as  a  preform,  which  is  a  glass  rod  that 
subsequently can be heated at one end and drawn  into a  fiber of  the desired  thickness.   Preforms 
are  either  solid  or  hollow.  The  solid  ones  are  usually  made  by  vapor  deposition  of  SiO2  and 
GeO2 on  the outer surface of  the  initial core  rod, which might be a millimeter  thick.   By varying 
the  mixture  of  gases,  usually  Si(Ge)Cl4  +  O2  ⇒  Si(Ge)O2  +  2Cl2,  the  permittivity  of  the 
deposited  glass  cladding  can  be  reduced  about  2  percent  below  that  of  the  core.    The  boundary 
between  core  and  cladding  can  be  sharp  or  graded  in  a  controlled  way.    Alternatively,  the 
preform  cladding  is  large  and  hollow,  and  the  core  is  deposited  from  the  inside  by  hot  gases  in 

- 378 -


the  same  way;  upon  completion  there  is  still  a  hole  through  the  middle  of  the  fiber.    Since  the 
core  is small compared  to  the cladding,  the preforms can be made more  rapidly  this way.   When 
the  preform  is  drawn  into  a  fiber,  any  hollow  core  vanishes.    Sometimes  a  hollow  core  is  an 
advantage.  For  example,  some  newer  types  of  fibers  have  cores with  laterally-periodic  lossless 
longitudinal hollows within which much of the energy can propagate. 

Another  major  design  issue  involves  the  fiber  dispersion  associated  with  frequency-
dependent  phase  and  group  velocities, where  the  phase  velocity  vp  =  ω/k.    If  the  group  velocity 
vg,  which  is  the  velocity  of  the  envelope  of  a  narrowband  sinusoid,  varies  over  the  optical 
bandwidth,  then  the  signal waveform will  increasingly distort as  it propagates because  the  faster 
moving  frequency components of  the envelope will arrive early.   For example, a digital pulse of 
light  that  lasts  T  seconds  is  produced  by  multiplying  a  boxcar  modulation  envelope  (the  T-
second  pulse  shape)  by  the  sinusoidal  optical  carrier,  so  the  frequency  spectrum  is  the 
convolution  of  the  spectrum  for  the  sinusoid  (a  spectral  impulse)  and  the  spectrum  for  a  boxcar 
pulse  (∝ [sin(2πt/T)]/[2πt/T]).  The  outermost  frequencies  suffer  from  dispersion  the  most,  and 
these are primarily associated with the sharp edges of the pulse. 

The group velocity vg derived in (9.5.20) is the slope of the dispersion relation at the optical 
frequency of interest: 

( k ω)−1 
vg  = ∂  ∂ 

(12.2.15) 

Figure 12.2.7 illustrates the dispersion relation for  three different modes;  the higher order modes 
propagate information more slowly.

The  group  velocity  vg  is  the  slope  of  the  ω(k)  relation  and  is  bounded  by  the  slopes  associated 
with  the  core  (vgcore)  and  with  the  cladding  (vgcladding),  where  the  cladding  is  assumed  to  be 
infinite.  The  figure  has  greatly  exaggerated  the  difference  in  the  slope  between  the  core  and 
cladding for illustrative purposes.

A  dispersive  line  eventually  transforms  a  square  optical  pulse  into  a  long  “frequency 
chirped”  pulse  with  the  faster  propagating  frequencies  in  the  front  and  the  slower  propagating 
frequencies in the back.  This problem can be minimized by carefully choosing combinations of: 
1)  the dispersion n(f) of  the glass, 2)  the permittivity  contour  ε(r)  in  the  fiber,  and 3)  the optical 
center  frequency  fo.  Otherwise we must  reduce  either  the  bandwidth  of  the  signal  or  the  length 
of  the  fiber.    To  increase  the  distance  between  amplifiers  the  dispersion  can  be  compensated 
periodically by special fibers or other elements with opposite dispersion. 

Pulses  spread  as  they  propagate  over  distance  L  because  their  outermost  frequency 
components ω1 and ω2 = ω1+Δω have arrival times at the output separated by:

where  vgi  is  the  group  velocity  at ωi  (12.2.15).  Typical  pulses  of  duration  Tp  have  a  bandwidth 
-1, so brief pulses spread faster.   The spread Δt  is  least at frequencies where d2k/dω2  ≅ 0, 
Δω ≅  Tp
which is near the representative slope inflection point illustrated in Figure 12.2.7.

This  natural  fiber  dispersion  can,  however,  help  solve  the  problem  of  fiber  nonlinearity. 
Since  attenuation  is  always  present  in  the  fibers,  the  amplifiers  operate  at  high  powers,  limited 
partly by their own nonlinearities and those in the fiber that arise because ε depends very slightly 
on the field strength E.  The effects of non-linearities are more severe when the signals are in the 
form  of  isolated  high-energy  pulses.    Deliberately  dispersing  and  spreading  the  isolated  pulses 
before  amplifying  and  introducing  them  to  the  fiber  reduces  their  peak  amplitudes  and  the 
resulting  nonlinear  effects.  This  pre-dispersion  is  made  opposite  to  that  of  the  fiber  so  that  the 
fiber  dispersion  gradually  compensates  for  the  pre-dispersion  over  the  full  length  of  the  fiber. 
That is, if the fiber propagates high frequencies faster, then those high frequency components are 
delayed correspondingly before being  introduced  to  the  fiber.   When  the pulses  reappear  in  their 
original  sharp  form  at  the  far  end  of  the  fiber  their  peak  amplitudes  are  so  weak  from  natural 
attenuation that they no longer drive the fiber nonlinear. 

Example 12.2A 
If 10-ps pulses are used  to  transmit data at 20 Gbps,  they would be spaced 5×10-10 sec apart and 
would  therefore begin  to  interfere with  each other  after propagating  a distance Lmax  sufficient  to 
spread  those  pulses  to  widths  of  50  ps.  A  standard  single-mode  optical  fiber  has  dispersion 
d2k/dω2 of 20 ps2/km  at 1.5 μm wavelength.   At what distance Lmax will  such 10-ps pulses have 
broadened to 50 ps? 

Solution:  Using (12.2.16) and Δω ≅ Tp

-1 we find: 

Lmax = Δt/[Δω(d2k/dω2)] = 50 ps × 10 ps /(20 ps2/km) = 25 km 

Thus we must slow this fiber to 10 Gbps if the amplifiers are 50 km apart.

12.3  Lasers 

12.3.1  Physical principles of stimulated emission and laser amplification 

Lasers  (Light  Amplification  by  Stimulated  Emission  of  Radiation)  amplify  electromagnetic 
waves  at wavelengths  ranging  from  radio  to  ultraviolet  and  x-rays.   They were  originally  called 
masers  because  the  first  units  amplified  only  microwaves.    Lasers  can  also  oscillate  when  the 
amplified  waves  are  reflected  back  into  the  device.    The  physical  principles  are  similar  at  all 
wavelengths, though the details differ.  Laser processes can occur in solids, liquids, or gases. 

Lasers  have  a  wide  and  growing  array  of  applications.    For  example,  optical  fiber 
communications  systems  today  commonly  use  Erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers  (EDFA’s)  that 
amplify ~1.5-micron wavelength signals having bandwidths up  to ~4 THz.   Semiconductor, gas, 
and  glass  fiber  laser  amplifiers  are  also  used  to  communicate within  single  pieces  of  equipment 
and  for  local  fiber  or  free-space  communications.  Lasers  also  generate  coherent  beams  of  light 
used  for measuring distances and angles;  recording and  reading data  from memory devices  such 
as CD’s  and DVD’s;  and  for  cutting, welding,  and  shaping materials,  including  even  the  human 
eye.  Laser  pointers  have  been  added  to  pocket  pens while  higher-power  industrial  units  can  cut 
steel plates  several  inches  thick.   Weapons  and  laser-driven nuclear  fusion  reactions  require  still 
higher-power  lasers.  Peak  laser  pulse  powers  can  exceed  1015 watts,  a  thousand  times  the  total 
U.S.  electrical  generating  capacity  of  ~5×1011  watts.  The  electric  field  strengths  within  a  focal 
spot  of  <100-micron  diameter  can  strip  electrons  from  atoms  and  accelerate  them  to  highly 
relativistic  velocities  within  a  single  cycle  of  the  radiation.    The  roles  of  lasers  in  science, 
medicine, industry, consumer products, and other fields are still being defined. 

Laser  operation  depends  intimately  upon  the  quantum  nature  of  matter  and  the  fact  that 
charges  trapped  in  atoms  and  molecules  generally  move  at  constant  energy  without  radiating. 
Instead,  transitions  between  atomic  or  molecular  energy  states  occur  abruptly,  releasing  or 
absorbing  a  photon.69    This  process  and  lasers  can  fortunately  be  understood  semi-classically 
without reference to a full quantum description. 

Electrons  within  atoms,  molecules,  and  crystals  occupy  discrete  energy  states;  the  lower 
energy  states  are  preferentially  occupied.    Energy  states  can  also  be  vibrational,  rotational, 
magnetic,  chemical,  nuclear,  etc.70   The  number  of  possible  states  greatly  exceeds  those  that  are 
occupied. 

69 Alternatively, acoustic phonons with energy hf can be  released or absorbed, or an additional molecular or atomic 
state  transition  can  occur  to  conserve  energy.    Phonons  are  acoustic  quanta  associated  with  mechanical  waves  in 
materials.  Optical  transitions can also absorb or emit  two photons with  total energy equal  to Ε2 − Ε1, although such 
two-photon transitions are much less likely. 
70  The  distances  between  adjacent  nuclei  in  molecules  can  oscillate  sinusoidally  with  quantized  amplitudes  and 
frequencies  characterisitic  of  each  vibrational  state. 
Isolated  molecules  can  spin  at  specific  frequencies 
corresponding to various rotational energy states.  Electron spins and orbits together have magnetic dipole moments 
that align with or oppose an applied magnetic  field  to a quantized degree.   Atoms bond  to one another  in quantized 
ways  having  specific  chemical  consequences.  Nuclear  magnetic  moments  can  also  align  with  other  atomic  or 
molecular magnetic moments in quantized ways corresponding to discrete energy states.

For example, as  illustrated  in Figure 12.3.1(a), an electron  trapped  in an atom, molecule, or 
crystal  with  energy  E1  can  be  excited  into  any  vacant  higher-energy  state  (E2)  by  absorbing  a 
photon of frequency f and energy ΔE where:

Figure 12.3.1  Photon absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission. 
 

Figures  12.3.1(b)  and  (c)  illustrate  two  additional  basic photon  processes:  spontaneous  emission 
and  stimulated  emission.  Photon  absorption  (a)  occurs  with  a  probability  that  depends  on  the 
photon  flux  density  [Wm-2],  frequency  [Hz],  and  the  cross-section  for  the  energy  transition  of 
interest.  Spontaneous  emission  of photons  (b) occurs with  a probability A  that depends only on 
the  transition,  as  discussed  below.    Stimulated  emission  (c)  occurs  when  an  incoming  photon 
triggers emission of a second photon; the emitted photon is always exactly in phase with the first, 
and  propagates  in  the  same  direction.    Laser  action  depends  entirely  on  this  third  process  of 
stimulated emission, while the first two processes often weaken it. 

The  net  effect  of  all  three  processes—absorption,  spontaneous  emission,  and  stimulated 
emission—is to alter the relative populations, N1 and N2, of the two energy levels of interest.  An 
example  exhibiting  these  processes  is  the  Erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers  commonly  used  to 
amplify  optical  telecommunications  signals  near  1.4-micron  wavelength  on  long  lines.    Figure 
12.3.2  illustrates  how  an  optical  fiber  with  numerous  atoms  excited  by  an  optical  pump 
(discussed further below) can amplify input signals at the proper frequency.  Since the number of 
excited  atoms  stimulated  to  emit  is  proportional  to  the  input  wave  intensity,  perhaps  only  one 
atom might  be  stimulated  to  emit  initially  (because  the  input  signal  is weak),  producing  two  in­
phase  photons—the  original  plus  the  one  stimulated.    These  two  then  propagate  further 
stimulating two emissions so as to yield four in-phase photons.

This  exponential  growth  continues  until  the  pump  can  no  longer  empty E1  and  refill E2  fast 
enough;  as  a  result  absorption  [m-1]  approaches  emission  [m-1]  as N1  approaches N2  locally.  In 
this  limit  the  increase  in  the  number  of  photons  per  unit  length  is  limited  by  the  number  np  of 
electrons  pumped  from  E1  to  E2  per  unit  length.    Thereafter  the  signal  strength  then  increases 
only  linearly  with  distance  rather  than  exponentially,  as  suggested  in  Figure  12.3.3;  the  power 
increase per unit length then approaches nphf [Wm-1].

absorptions (∝ N1), where the rate coefficients are:

In  these  equations  n  is  the  index  of  refraction  of  the  fiber  and  D21  is  the  quantum  mechanical

of  the  dipole  moment  Dij  from  one  pair  of  levels  to  another  that  makes  pumping  practical,  as 
explained below. 

(12.3.4) 

(12.3.5)

Laser amplification can occur only when N2 exceeds N1, but in a two-level system no pump 
excitation  can  accomplish  this;  even  infinitely  strong  incident  radiation  I21  at  the  proper 
frequency  can  only  equalize  the  two  populations  via  (12.3.2).71    Instead,  three-  or  four-level 
lasers  are  generally  used.  The  general  principle  is  illustrated  by  the  three-level  laser  of  Figure 
12.3.4(a), for which the optical laser pump radiation driving the 1,3 transition is so strong that it 
roughly  equalizes N1  and N3.  The  key  to  this  laser  is  that  the  spontaneous  rate  of  emission A32 
>> A21 so that all the active atoms quickly accumulate in the metastable long-lived level 2 in the 
absence of stimulation at f21.  This generally requires D32 >> D21, and finding materials with such 
properties for a desired laser frequency can be challenging.

Since  it  requires  hf13  Joules  to  raise  each  atom  to  level  3,  and  only  hf21  Joules  emerges  as 
amplified  additional  radiation,  the  power  efficiency  η  (power  out/power  in)  cannot  exceed  the 
intrinsic  limit  ηI  =  f21/f31. 
In  fact  the  efficiency  is  lowered  further  by  a  factor  of  ηA 
corresponding  to  spontaneous  emission  from  level  3  directly  to  level  1,  bypassing  level  2  as 
suggested  in  Figure  12.3.4(b),  and  to  the  spontaneous  decay  rate  A21  which  produces  radiation 
that  is  not  coherent  with  the  incoming  signal  and  radiates  in  all  directions.    Finally,  only  a 
fraction ηp of  the pump photons are absorbed by  the  transition 1→2.  Thus  the maximum power 
efficiency for this laser in the absence of propagation losses is: 

η = η η  η

(12.3.6)

71  Two-level  lasers  have  been  built,  however,  by  physically  separating  the  excited  atoms  or  molecules  from  the 
unexcited  ones.    For  example,  excited  ammonia molecules  can  be  separated  from  unexcited  ones  by  virtue  of  their 
difference in deflection when a beam of such atoms in vacuum passes through an electric field gradient. 

- 384 -


Figure 12.3.4(c)  suggests a  typical design  for a  four-level  laser, where both A32 and A41 are 
much  greater  than  A24  or  A21  so  that  energy  level  2  is  metastable  and  most  atoms  accumulate 
there  in  the  absence  of  strong  radiation  at  frequency  f24  or  f21.  The  strong  pump  radiation  can 
come  from  a  laser,  flash  lamp,  or  other  strong  radiation  source.    Sunlight,  chemical  reactions, 
nuclear radiation, and electrical currents in gases pump some systems. 

The  ω3  dependence  of  A21  (12.3.5)  has  a  profound  effect  on  maser  and  laser  action.    For 
example,  any  two-level maser  or  laser must  excite  enough  atoms  to  level  2  to  equal  the  sum  of 
the stimulated and spontaneous decay rates.  Since the spontaneous decay rate increases with ω3, 
the  pump  power  must  also  increase  with  ω3  times  the  energy  hf  of  each  excited  photon.    Thus 
pump  power  requirements  increase  very  roughly  with  ω4,  making  construction  of  x-ray  or 
gamma-ray  lasers  extremely  difficult  without  exceptionally  high  pump  powers;  even  ultraviolet 
lasers pose a challenge.   Conversely, at  radio wavelengths  the  spontaneous  rates of decay are  so 
extremely  small  that  exceedingly  low  pump  powers  suffice,  as  they  sometimes  do  in  the  vast 
darkness of interstellar space.

  Many  types  of  astrophysical  masers  exist  in  low-density  interstellar  gases  containing H2O, 
OH, CO,  and  other molecules.   They  are  typically  pumped  by  radiation  from  nearby  stars  or  by 
collisions  occurring  in  shock  waves.    Sometimes  these  lasers  radiate  radially  from  stars, 
amplifying  starlight,  and  sometimes  they  spontaneously  radiate  tangentially  along  linear 
circumstellar  paths  that  have  minimal  relative  Doppler  shifts.    Laser  or  maser  action  can  also 
occur  in  darkness  far  from  stars  as  a  result  of  molecular  collisions.    The  detailed  frequency, 
spatial,  and  time  structures  observed  in  astrophysical  masers  offer  unique  insights  into  a  wide 
range of astrophysical phenomena. 

Example 12.3A 
What  is  the  ratio  of  laser  output  power  to  pump  power  for  a  three-level  laser  like  that  shown  in 
Figure  12.3.4(a)  if:  1)  all  pump  power  is  absorbed  by  the  1→3  transition,  2)  N2  >>  N1,  3) 
A21/I21B21 = 0.1, 4) A31 = 0.1A32, and 5) f31 = 4f21? 

Solution:	 The  desired  ratio  is  the  efficiency  η  of  (12.3.6)  where  the  intrinsic  efficiency  is 
ηI  =  f21/f31  =  0.25,  and  the  pump  absorption  efficiency  ηp  =  1.  The  efficiency  ηA  is 
less  than  unity  because  of  two  small  energy  losses:  the  ratio  A31/A32  =  0.1,  and  the 
ratio  A21/I21B21  =  0.1.  Therefore  ηA  =  0.92  =  0.81,  and  η  =  ηIηAηp  =  0.25  ×  0.81  ≅ 
0.20. 

12.3.2  Laser oscillators 

Laser  amplifiers  oscillate  nearly  monochromatically  if  an  adequate  fraction  of  the    amplified 
signal  is  reflected  back  to  be  amplified  further.    For  example,  the  laser  oscillator  pictured  in 
Figure  12.3.5  has  parallel mirrors  at  both  ends  of  a  laser  amplifier,  separated  by L meters.   One 
mirror  is perfect and  the other  transmits a  fraction T  (say ~0.1) of  the  incident  laser power.   The 
roundtrip  gain  in  the  absence  of  loss  is  e2gL.  This  system  oscillates  if  the  net  roundtrip  gain  at 
any  frequency  exceeds  unity,  where  round-trip  absorption  (e-2αL)  and  the  partially  transmitting 
mirror account for most loss.

Amplifiers  at  the  threshold  of  oscillation  are  usually  in  their  exponential  region,  so  this  net 
roundtrip gain exceeds unity when: 

( −α) > 1

( − ) 

(12.3.7) 

Equation  (12.3.7)  implies  e2(g  - α)L  ≥  (1-T)-1  for  oscillation  to  occur.  Generally  the  gain  g  per 
meter is designed to be as high as practical, and then L and T are chosen to be consistent with the 
desired output power.  The pump power must be above the minimum threshold that yields g > α. 

The output power  from  such an oscillator  is  simply Pout = TP+ watts,  and depends on pump 
power Ppump and laser efficiency.  Therefore: 

P+ = Pout  T = η Ppump  T 

(12.3.8) 

Thus  small  values  of  T  simply  result  in  higher  values  of  P+,  which  can  be  limited  by  internet 
breakdown or failure. 

One  approach  to  obtaining  extremely  high  laser  pulse  powers  is  to  abruptly  increase  the  Q 
(reverberation) of  the  laser  resonator after  the pump source has  fully populated  the upper energy 
level.  To prevent  lasing before  that  level  is fully populated, strong absorption can be  introduced 
in  the  round-trip  laser path  to prevent  amplification of  any  stimulated  emission.   The  instant  the 
absorption  ceases,  i.e.  after  Q-switching,  the  average  round-trip  gain  g  of  the  laser  per  meter 
exceeds  the  average  absorption α  and oscillation  commences.   At high Q values  lasing  action  is 
rapid  and  intense,  so  the  entire  upper  population  is  encouraged  to  emit  instantly,  particularly  if 
the lower level can be rapidly emptied.  Such a device is called a Q-switched laser.  Resonator Q 
is discussed further in Section 7.8. 

The electronic  states of glass  fiber amplifiers are usually associated with quantized electron 
orbits  around  the  added  Erbium  atoms,  and  state  transitions  simply  involve  electron  transfers 
between  two  atomic  orbits  having  different  energies.    In  contrast,  the  most  common  lasers  are 
laser  diodes,  which  are  transparent  semiconductor  p-n  junctions  for  which  the  electron  energy 
transitions occur between the conduction and valence bands, as suggested in Figure 12.3.6.

Figure 12.3.6  Laser diode – a forward-biased p-n junction  
 
bounded by mirrors promoting oscillation. 

Parallel  mirrors  at  the  sides  of  the  p-n  junction  partially  trap  the  laser  energy,  forming  an 
oscillator  that  radiates  perpendicular  to  the  mirrors;  one  of  the  mirrors  is  semi-transparent. 
Strong  emission  does  not  occur  in  any  other  direction  because  without  the  mirrors  there  is  no 
feedback.  Such  lasers  are  pumped  by  forward-biasing  the  diode  so  that  electrons  thermally 
excited  into  the  n-type  conduction  band  diffuse  into  the  active  region  where  photons  can 
stimulate emission, yielding amplification and oscillation within  the ~0.2-μm  thick p-n  junction. 
Vacancies  in  the  valence  band  are  provided  by  the holes  that  diffuse  into  the  active  region  from 
the  p-type  region.  Voltage-modulated  laser  diodes  can  produce  digital  pulse  streams  at  rates 
above 100 Mbps. 

The vertical axis E of Figure 12.3.6(a) is electron energy and the horizontal axis is position z 
 
through the diode from the p to n sides of the junction.   The exponentials suggest the Boltzmann 
energy distributions of the holes and electrons in the valence and conduction bands, respectively. 
Below  the Fermi  level, EF, energy states have a high probability of being occupied by electrons; 
EF(z)  tilts  up  toward  the  right  because  of  the  voltage  drop  from  the  p-side  to  the  n-side.    Figure 
12.3.6(b)  plots  electron  energy  E  versus  the  magnitude  of  the  k  vector  for  electrons  (quantum 
approaches  treat  electrons  as  waves  characterized  by  their  wavenumber  k),  and  suggests  why 
diode  lasers  can  have  broad  bandwidths:  the  energy  band  curvature  with  k  broadens  the  laser 
linewidth  Δf.  Incoming  photons  can  stimulate  any  electron  in  the  conduction  band  to  decay  to 
any  empty  level  (hole)  in  the  valence  band,  and  both  of  these  bands  have  significant  energy 
spreads ΔE, where the linewidth Δf ≅ ΔE/h [Hz]. 

The  resonant  frequencies  of  laser  diode  oscillators  are  determined  by E2  - E1,  the  linewidth 
of that transition, and by the resonant frequencies of the TEM mirror cavity resonator.  The width 
Δω  of  each  resonance  is  discussed  further  later.    If  the mirrors  are  perfect  conductors  that  force 
E //  = 0 ,  then  there must be an  integral number m of half wavelengths within  the cavity  length L 
so that mλm = 2L.  The wavelength λm' is typically shorter than the free-space wavelength λm due 
to the index of refraction n of the laser material.  Therefore λm = 2Ln/m = c/fm, and: 

fm  = cm

For typical laser diodes L and n might be 0.5 mm and 3, respectively, yielding a spacing between 
cavity  resonances  of:  c/2Ln  =  3×108/(2×10-3×1.5)  =  100  GHz,  as  suggested  in  Figure  12.3.7(a). 
The  figure  suggests  how  the  natural  (atomic)  laser  line  width  might  accommodate  multiple 
cavity resonances, or possibly only one.

If  the  amplifier  line  shape  is  narrow  compared  to  the  spacing  between  cavity  resonances, 
then  the  cavity  length L might  require  adjustment  in  order  to  place  one  of  the  cavity  resonances 
on  the  line  center  before  oscillations  occur.  The  line width  of  a  laser  depends  on  the widths  of 
the associated energy levels Ei and Ej.  These can be quite broad, as suggested by the laser diode 
energy  bands  illustrated  in  Figure  12.3.6(b),  or  quite  narrow.    Similarly,  the  atoms  in  an  EDFA 
are each subject  to slightly different  local electrical fields due  to  the random nature of  the glassy 
structure  in which  they are  imbedded.   This  results  in each atom having  slightly different values 
for  Ei  so  that  EFDA’s  amplify  over  bandwidths  much  larger  than  the  bandwidth  of  any  single 
atom. 

Lasers  for  which  each  atom  has  its  own  slightly  displaced  resonant  frequency  due  to  local 
fields are said  to exhibit  inhomogeneous  line broadening.  In contrast, many  lasers have no such 
frequency  spread  induced  by  local  factors,  so  that  all  excited  atoms  exhibit  the  same  line  center 
and  width;  these  are  said  to  exhibit  homogeneous  line  broadening.  The  significance  of  this 
difference  is  that  when  laser  amplifiers  are  saturated  and  operate  in  their  linear  growth  region, 
homogeneously  broadened  lasers  permit  the  strongest  cavity  resonance  within  the  natural  line 
width  to  capture  most  of  the  energy  available  from  the  laser  pump,  suppressing  the  rest  of  the 
emission  and  narrowing  the  line,  as  suggested  in  Figure  12.3.7(b).    This  suppression  of  weak 
resonances  is  reduced  in  inhomogeneously  broadened  lasers  because  all  atoms  are  pumped 
equally  and  have  their  own  frequency  sub-bands  where  they  amplify  independently  within  the 
natural line width. 

In  gases  the  width  of  any  spectral  line  is  also  controlled  by  the  frequency  of  molecular 
collisions.  Figure  12.3.8(b)  illustrates  how  an  atom  or molecule with  sinusoidal  time  variations 
in  its  dipole  moment  might  be  interrupted  by  collisions  that  randomly  reset  the  phase.    An 
electromagnetic wave interacting with this atom or molecule would then see a less pure sinusoid. 
This new spectral characteristic would no longer be a spectral impulse, i.e., the Fourier transform 
of  a  pure  sinusoid,  but  rather  the  transform  of  a  randomly  interrupted  sinusoid,  which  has  the 
Lorentz  line  shape  illustrated  in  Figure  12.3.8(a).    Its  half-power  width  is  Δf,  which  is 
approximately  the  collision  frequency  divided  by  2π.  The  limited  lifetime  of  an  atom  or 

- 388 -


molecule  in  any  state  due  to  the  probability  A  of  spontaneous  emission  results  in  similar 
broadening, where Δf ≅ A/2π; this is called the intrinsic linewidth of that transition.

Example 12.3B 
A Q-switched 1-micron wavelength laser of length L = 1 mm is doped with 1018 active atoms all 
pumped  to  their  upper  state.   When  the  Q  switches  instantly  to  100,  approximately  what  is  the 
maximum laser power output P [W]?  Assume ε = 4εo. 

Solution:  The total energy released when the Q switches is 1018hf ≅ 1018 × 6.6×10-34  × 3×1014 = 
0.20 Joules.  If  the  laser gain  is sufficiently high,  then a  triggering photon originating 
near  the  output  could  be  fully  amplified  by  the  time  the  beam  reaches  the  rear  of  the 
laser, so that all atoms would be excited as that reflected pulse emerges from the front 
of  the  laser.  A  triggering  photon  at  the  rear  of  the  laser  would  leave  some  atoms 
unexcited.  Thus  the minimum  time  for  full  energy  release  lies  between  one  and  two 
transit  times τ of  the  laser, depending on  its gain; τ = L/c' = 2L/c = 6.7×10-12.  Lower 
laser  gains  may  require  many  transit  times  before  all  atoms  are  stimulated  to  emit. 
Therefore P < ~0.2/(6.7×10-12) ≅ 30 GW. 

12.4  Optical detectors, multiplexers, interferometers, and switches 

12.4.1  Phototubes 

Sensitive  radio-frequency  detectors  typically  require  at  least  10-20  Joules  per  bit  of  information, 
which  roughly  corresponds  to  thousands  of  photons  of  energy  hf,  where  Planck’s  constant  h  = 
6.625×10-34  Joules  Hz-1.  This  number  of  photons  is  sufficiently  high  that  we  can  ignore  most 
quantum  effects  and  treat  the  arriving  radio  signals  as  traditional  waves.    In  contrast,  many 
optical detectors can detect single photons, although more than five photons are typically used to 
distinguish each pulse from interference; this requires more energy per bit than is needed at radio 
wavelengths.  The  advantage of  long-range optical  links  lies  instead  in  the  extremely  low  losses 
of  optical  fibers  or,  alternatively,  in  the  ability of  relatively  small mirrors  or  telescopes  to  focus 

- 389 -


energy  in  extremely  small  beams  so  as  to  achieve  much  higher  gains  than  can  practical  radio 
antennas. 

Typical  photon  detectors  include  phototubes  and  semiconductors.    A  phototube  detects 
photons having energies hf > Φ using the photoelectric effect, where Φ is the work function [J] of 
the  metal  surface  (cathode)  that  intercepts  the  photons.    Photons  with  energies  above  this 
threshold  eject  an  electron  from  the  cathode  with  typical  probabilities  η  (called  the  quantum 
efficiency)  of  ~10-30  percent.    These  ejected  electrons  are  then  pulled  in  vacuum  toward  a 
positively charged anode and contribute to the current I through the load resistor R, as illustrated 
in Figure 12.4.1(a).  Although early phototubes ejected electrons from  the  illuminated surface,  it 
is now common for the metal to be sufficiently thin and transparent that the electrons are emitted 
from  the  backside  of  the  metal  into  vacuum;  the  metal  is  evaporated  in  a  thin  layer  onto  the 
interior surface of the tube’s evacuated glass envelope.

(12.4.1) 

The work functions of most metals are ~2-6 electron volts, where the energy of one electron volt 
(e.v.)  is  –eV  =  1.602×10-19  Joules72.  Therefore  phototubes  do  not  work  well  for  infrared  or 
longer  wavelengths  because  their  energy  hf  is  too  small;  2  e.v.  corresponds  to  a  wavelength  of 
0.62 microns and the color red. 

Because  the  charge  on  an  electron  is  small,  the  currents  I  are  often  too  small  to  induce 
voltages  across  R  (see  Figure  12.4.1)  that  exceed  the  thermal  noise  (Johnson  noise)  of  the 
resistor unless the illumination is bright.  Photomultiplier tubes release perhaps 104 electrons per 
detected  photon  so  as  to  overcome  this  noise  and  permit  each  detected  photon  to  be 
unambiguously  counted.    The  structure  of  a  typical  photomultiplier  tube  is  illustrated  in  Figure 
12.4.1(b).  Each  photoelectron  emitted  by  the  cathode  is  accelerated  toward  the  first  dynode  at 
~50-100  volts,  and  gains  energy  sufficient  to  eject  perhaps  five  or  more  low  energy  electrons 
from the dynode that are then accelerated toward the second dynode to be multiplied again.  The

illustrated  tube  has  four  dynodes  that,  when  appropriately  charged,  each  multiply  the  incident 
electrons  by  ~5  to  yield  ~54  ≅  625  electrons  at  the  output  for  each  photon  detected  at  the  input. 
Typical  tubes  have  more  dynodes  and  gains  of  ~104-107.  Such  large  current  pulses  generally 
overwhelm  the  thermal  noise  in  R,  so  random  electron  emissions  induced  by  cosmic  rays  or 
thermal  effects  at  the  cathode  dominate  the  detector  noise.    The  collecting  areas  of  such  tubes 
can be enhanced with lenses or mirrors. 

12.4.2  Photodiodes 

Phototubes  are  generally  large  (several  cubic  inches),  expensive,  and  fragile,  and  therefore 
semiconductor photodiodes are more commonly used.  Photodiodes also respond better to visible 
and  infrared  wavelengths  and  operate  at  much  lower  voltages.    Figure  12.4.2(a)  illustrates  the 
energy  diagram  for  a  typical  short-circuited  p-n  junction  between  p-type  and  n-type 
semiconductors, where  the vertical axis  is electron energy E and  the horizontal axis  is distance z 
perpendicular to the planar junction.

The  lower  cross-hatched  area  is  the  valence  band  within  which  electrons  are  lightly  bound  to 
ions,  and  the  upper  area  is  the  conduction  band  within  which  electrons  are  free  to  move  in 
response  to electric  fields.   The band gap between  these  regions  is ~1.12 electron volts  (e.v.)  for 
silicon,  and  ranges  from  0.16  e.v.  for  InSb  (indium  antimonide  to  ~7.5  e.v.  for  BN  (boron 
nitride).  In metals there is no such gap and some electrons always reside in the conduction band 
and are mobile.  Additional discussion of p-n junctions appears in Section 8.2.4. 

Electrons  move  freely  in  the  conduction  band,  but  not  if  they  remain  in  the  valence  band. 
Most  photons  entering  the  junction  region  with  energy  greater  than  the  bandgap  between  the 
Fermi  level  and  the  lower  edge  of  the  conduction  band  can  excite  electrons  into  the  conduction 

- 391 -


band  to  enhance  device  conductivity.    In  semiconductors  the  Fermi  level  is  that  level 
corresponding  to  the  nominal  maximum  energy  of  electrons  available  for  excitation  into  the 
conduction  band.    The  local  Fermi  level  is  determined  by  impurities  in  the  semiconductors  that 
create  electron  donor  or  acceptor  sites;  these  sites  easily  release  or  capture,  respectively,  a  free 
electron.  The Fermi level sits just below the conduction band for n-type semiconductors because 
donor atoms easily release one of their electrons into the conduction band, as illustrated in Figure 
12.4.2(a)  and  (b).  The  Fermi  level  sits  just  above  the  valence  band  for  p-type  semiconductors 
because acceptor atoms easily capture an extra electron from bound states in nearby atoms. 

If  the  p-n  junction  is  short-circuited  externally,  the  Fermi  level  is  the  same  on  both  halves, 
as  shown  in  Figure  12.4.2(a).  Random  thermal  excitation  produces  an  exponential  Boltzmann 
distribution  in  electron  energy,  as  suggested  in  the  figure,  the  upper  tails  of  which  lie  in  the 
conduction band on both halves of the junction.  When the device is short-circuited these current 
flows  from  thermal  excitations  in  the  p  and  n  halves  of  the  junction  balance,  and  the  external 
If,  however,  the  diode  is  back-biased  by  VB  volts  as  illustrated  in  Figure 
current  is  zero. 
12.4.2(b),  then  the  two  exponential  tails  do  not  balance  and  a  net  back-current  current  flows,  as 
suggested  by  the  I-V  characteristic  for  a  p-n  junction  illustrated  in  Figure  12.4.2(c).    The  back 
current  for  an  un-illuminated  photodiode  approaches  an  asymptote  determined  by  VB  and  the 
number  of  thermal  electrons  excited  per  second  into  the  conduction  band  for  the  p-type 
semiconductor.    When  an  un-illuminated  junction  is  forward  biased,  the  current  increases 
roughly exponentially. 

When  a  p-n  junction  is  operated  as  a  photodiode,  it  is  back-biased  so  that  every  detected 
photon  contributes  current  flow  to  the  circuit,  nearly  one  electron  per  photon  received.    By 
cooling the photodiode the thermal contribution to diode current can be reduced markedly so that 
the diode becomes more sensitive to dim light.  Cooling is particularly important for photodiodes 
with  the  small  bandgaps  needed  for  detecting  infrared  radiation;  otherwise  the  detected  infrared 
signals must be bright so they exceed the detector noise. 

If photodiodes are sufficiently back-biased, they can enter the avalanche region illustrated in 
Figure  12.4.2(c),  where  an  excited  electron  is  accelerated  sufficiently  as  it  moves  through  the 
semiconductor  that  it  can  impact  and  excite  another  electron  into  the  conduction  band;  both 
electrons can now accelerate and excite even more electrons, exponentially, until they all exit the 
high-field  zone  so  that  further  excitations  are  not  possible.    In  response  to  a  single  detected 
photon  such  avalanche photodiodes  (APD’s)  can  produce  an  output  pulse  of ~104  electrons  that 
stands  out  sufficiently  above  the  thermal  noise  that  photons  can  again  be  counted  individually. 
The  number  of  photons  detected  per  second  is  proportional  to  input  power,  and  therefore  to  the 
square of the incident electric field strength. 

12.4.3  Frequency-multiplexing devices and filters 

The major  components  in  fiber-optic  communications  systems  are  the  fibers  themselves  and  the 
optoelectronic  devices  that  manipulate  the  optical  signals,  such  as  detectors  (discussed  in 
Sections  12.4.1–2),  amplifiers  and  sources  (Section  12.3), multiplexers  and  filters  (this  section), 
modulators, mixers,  switches,  and others  (Section 12.4.4).   These  are  assembled  to  create useful 
communications, computing, or other systems.

A  typical  wave-division  multiplexed  (WDM)  amplifier  is  pictured  in  Figure  12.4.3; 
narrowband optical  signals of different colors are aggregated at a point of departure and merged 
onto  a  single  long  fiber  by  a  frequency  multiplexer  (MUX).    Along  this  fiber  extremely 
broadband  optical  amplifiers  (OAMPs)  are  spaced  perhaps  80  km  apart  to  sustain  the  signal 
strength.  OAMPs  today  are  typically  erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers  (EFDA’s).    At  the  far  end 
the  signal  is  de-multiplexed  into  its  spectral  components,  which  are  then  directed  appropriately 
along separate optical fibers.  Before broadband amplifiers were available, each narrow band had 
to have separate amplifiers and often separate fibers.

Such  multiplexers  can  be  made  using  prisms  or  diffraction  gratings  that  refract  or  diffract 
different  colors  at  different  angles,  as  suggested  in  Figure  12.4.4(a)  and  (b);  by  reciprocity  the 
same  devices  can  be  used  either  for  multiplexing  (superimposing  multiple  frequency  bands  on 
one  beam)  or  demultiplexing  (separation  of  a  single  beam  into  multiple  bands),  depending  on 
which end of the device receives the input. 

The  diffraction  grating  of  Figure  12.4.4(b)  is  typically  illuminated  by  normally  incident 
uniform  plane  waves,  and  consists  of  closely  spaced  ruled  straight  lines  where  equal-width 
stripes  typically  alternate  between  transmission  and  reflection  or  absorption.    Alternate  stripes 
sometimes  differ  only  in  their  phase.    Each  stripe  must  be  more  than  λ/2  wide,  and  λ  is  more 
typical.  In  this  case  the  rays  from  each  transparent  stripe  2λ  apart  will  add  in  phase  straight 
forward  (θ  =  0)  and  at  θ  =  sin-1(λ/2λ)  =  30o,  exactly  analogous  to  the  grating  lobes  of  dipole 
array antennas (Section 10.4).  Since the stripe separation (2λ here) is fixed, as the frequency f = 
c/λ varies, so does θ,  thus directing different frequencies  toward different angles of propagation, 
much like the prism. 

Another  useful  optical  device  is  the  Fabry-Perot  resonator,  which  is  the  optical  version  of 
the TEM resonator illustrated in Figure 7.4.3(a) and explained in Section 7.4.3.  For example, an 
optical TEM resonator can be fabricated using parallel mirrors with uniform plane waves trapped 
between them; the allowed resonator modes have an integral number n of half-wavelengths in the 
distance L between the parallel conductors: 

nλ n 2 = L

Thus the frequency fn of the nth TEM resonance is: 

f =c  λ = nc  2L  [Hz  ] 
n 
n 

(12.4.3)

and  the separation between adjacent  resonances  is c/2L  [Hz].   For example,  if L  is 1.5 mm,  then 
the resonances are separated 3×108/0.003 = 100 GHz. 

If  the  input  and  output mirrors  transmit  the  same  small  fraction  of  the  power  incident  upon 
them,  then  the “internal” and external Q’s of  this  resonator are  the  same, where  the “internal Q” 
here  (QI)  is associated with power escaping  through  the output mirror and  the “external Q”  (QE) 
is  associated  with  power  escaping  through  the  input  mirror.    As  suggested  by  the  equivalent 
circuits in Figures 7.4.4–5, there is perfect power transmission through the resonator at resonance 
when  the  internal  and  external Q’s  are  the  same,  provided  there  are  no  dissipative  losses within 
the resonator itself.  The width of the resonance is then found from (7.4.45–6): 

Δω = ω o  QL  = 2ωo  QE  = 2P
 
E  w T 

(12.4.4) 

- 394 -


The loaded QL = QE/2 when QE = QI, and PE [W]  is  the power escaping  through  the input mirror 
when  the  total  energy  stored  in  the  resonator  is  wT  [J].   With  high  reflectivity  mirrors  and  low 
residual  losses  the  bandwidth  of  such  a  resonator  can  be  made  almost  arbitrarily  narrow.    At 
optical frequencies the ratio of cavity length L to wavelength λ is also very large.  This increases 
the ratio of wT to PE proportionally and leads to very high QL and narrow linewidth. 

If  the  medium  in  a  Fabry-Perot  interferometer  is  dispersive,  then  it  can  be  shown  that  the 
spacing  between  resonances  is  vg/2L  [Hz],  or  the  reciprocal  of  the  round-trip  time  for  a  pulse. 
Thus such a resonator filled with an active medium could amplify a single pulse that rattles back 
and  forth  in  the  resonator  producing  sharp  output  pulses  with  a  period  2L/vg.  The  Fourier 
transform  of  this  pulse  train  is  a  train  of  impulses  in  the  frequency  domain  with  spacing  vg/2L, 
i.e., representing the set of resonant frequencies for this resonator. The resonant modes of such a 
mode-locked  laser  are  synchronized,  so  they  can  usefully  generate  pulse  trains  for  subsequent 
modulation. 

Example 12.4A 
What  is  the  ratio  of  the  width  Δω  of  the  passband  for  a  Fabry-Perot  resonator  relative  to  the 
spacing  ωi+1  - ωi  between  adjacent  resonances?    What  power  transmission  coefficient 
T2 =  |Et|2/|Ei|2  is required for each mirror  in order  to produce  isolated sharp resonances?   What  is 
the width Δf [Hz] of each resonance? 

Solution:  The resonance width Δω and spacing are given by (12.4.4) and (12.4.2), respectively, 
so: 
Δω ω  − ω  =  2P  w T )  (πc L ) =  (2P  T  ) (2LP +  c)⎦(L πc) = T  π < ~ 0.3

12.4.4  Interferometers 

The  Michelson  interferometer  and  the  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  are  important  devices 
illustrated  in  Figure  12.4.4(c)  and  (d),  respectively.    In  both  cases  an  input  optical  beam  is  split 
by  a  beam-splitter  into  two  coherent  beams  that  are  reflected  by  mirrors  and  then  recombined 
coherently  in  a  second  beam-splitter  to  form  two  output  beams.    The  intensity  of  each  output 
beam depends on whether  its  two  input components added  in-phase or out-of-phase.   The beam-
splitters  are  typically  dielectric  mirrors  coated  so  that  half  the  power  is  reflected  and  half 
transmitted from the front surface; the rear surface might be anti-reflection coated.  Half-silvered 
mirrors can also be used. 

As  the  position  x  of  a  Michelson  mirror  varies,  the  output  power  varies  sinusoidally  from 
zero,  which  results  when  the  two  beams  cancel  at  the  output,  to  its  peak  value  when  the  two 
beams  add  in  phase.    Cancellation  requires  that  the  two  beams  have  equal  strength.    It  is 
interesting  to  ask  where  the  input  power  goes  when  output  “A”  is  zero;  the  figure  suggests  the 
answer.  The  missing  power  emerges  from  the  other  output;  the  sum  of  the  powers  emerging 

- 395 -


from  the  two  outputs  equals  the  input  power,  less  any  dissipative  losses.    This  requirement  for 
power  conservation  translates  into  a  requirement  for  a  specific  phase  relationship  between  the 
various beams. 

Consecutive  peaks  in  output  strength  occur  as  the  mirror  moves  λ/2  (typically  ~3×10-7  m); 
the  factor  of  1/2  arises  because  of  the  round  trip  taken  by  the  reflected  beam.    The  sinusoidal 
output  power  can  generally  be  measured  with  sufficient  accuracy  at  optical  wavelengths  to 
determine  relative mirror  positions  x with  accuracies  of  an  angstrom  (10-10 m),  or  tiny  fractions 
thereof;  thus  the  Michelson  interferometer  is  a  powerful  tool  for  measuring  or  comparing 
wavelengths  and  distances.  Another  important  application  is  measurement  of  optical  spectra. 
Since  each  optical wavelength  λ  in  the  input  beam  produces  an  additive  sinusoidal  contribution 
to the output power waveform A(x) of period λ/2, the input optical power spectrum is the Fourier 
transform of A(2x).  Because this technique was first used to analyze infrared spectra, it is called 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 

If the two output beams in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer add in phase, the output power is 
maximized  and  equals  the  input  power, much  like  the Michelson  interferometer.    In  either  type 
of  interferometer  the  phase  of  the  optical  beam  in  one  arm  can  be  modulated  by  varying  the 
effective  dielectric  constant  and  delay  of  its  propagation medium;  certain  dielectrics  are  tunable 
when  biased with  large  electric  fields.    In  this  fashion  the  output  beam  power  can  be modulated 
by  varying  the  voltage  V  across  the  propagation  medium,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  12.4.4(d)  and 
(e).  If  the  device  operates  near  a  transmission  null,  very  little  change  in  refractive  index  is 
required  to produce  a  large  increase  in  output  power.   Such  devices  can modulate  optical  power 
at frequencies of 10 GHz or more. 

The  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  configuration  in  Figure  12.4.4(e)  is  widely  used  for 
modulators  because  the  waveguides  can  be  integrated  on  a  chip  together  with  other  optical 
components.    The  output  is  maximum  when  the  two  arms  have  equal  phase  delays.   When  the 
two  merging  beams  are  out  of  phase  the  excited  waveguide  mode  is  not  trapped  in  the  output 
waveguide  but  radiates  away;  the  radiated  wave  corresponds  to  output  B  in  Figure  12.4.4(d). 
The  same  integrated  configuration  can  alternatively  be  used  as  a  notch  filter,  eliminating  an 
undesired optical wavelength  for which  the  two arm  lengths differ by exactly λ/2, while passing 
nearby wavelengths. 

12.4.5  Optical switches 

Optical  switches  redirect  optical  beams  just  as  electrical  switches  redirect  currents.    One 
approach is to use MEMS devices that mechanically move mirrors or shutters to redirect the light 
beams,  which  usually  are  narrow,  coherent,  and  laser-produced.    Such  devices  can  switch  light 
beams at rates approaching 1 MHz. 

Another  approach  is  to  direct  the  light  beam  at  right  angles  to  a  dielectric  within  which 
ultrasonic  acoustic  waves  (at  radio  frequencies)  are  propagating  transverse  to  the  light  so  as  to 
produce  a  dynamic  phase  grating  through  which  the  light  propagates  and  diffracts.    The 
configuration  is  that  of  Figure  12.4.4(b).  The  acoustic  waves  compress  and  decompress  the 
medium  in  a  wavy  pattern;  the  compressed  regions  have  a  slightly  higher  permittivity  and 

- 396 -


therefore  a  slightly  lower  velocity  of  light.    By  making  the  dielectric  sufficiently  thick,  the 
cumulative  phase  variation  of  the  light  passing  through  the  device  can  be  λ/2  or  more,  thus 
producing  strong  diffraction  at  an  angle  θ  corresponding  to  the  wavelength  of  light  λ  and  the 
acoustic  wavelength  λa,  where  θ  =  sin-1(λ/λa)  and  λa  ≅  2λ.  In  practice  the  cumulative  phase 
variation  is  often  much  less  than  λ/2  because  of  improved  simplicity,  linearity,  and  the 
availability  of  high  input  powers  that  can  compensate  for  the  reduced  diffractive  power 
efficiency.  In this fashion the diffracted beam can be steered among several output ports at rates 
up  to  ~1  MHz  or  more,  limited  largely  by  the  time  it  takes  the  acoustic  wave  to  traverse  the 
diffraction zone.  Acoustic velocities in solids are roughly 1000-3000 m/s. 

A  more  important  method,  however,  is  the  use  of  Mach-Zehnder  interferometers  (see 
Section  12.4.4)  to modulate  input  optical  streams,  varying  their  intensity  by more  than  15  dB  at 
rates  up  to  ~10  GHz,  limited  by  the  time  it  takes  the  signals  modulating  the  electrical  phase 
length modulator of Figure 12.4.4(e) to propagate across that modulator (e.g. nanoseconds).  The 
detected  modulator  output  signal  is  the  product  of  the  optical  and  modulator  signals.    The 
spectrum of  this product contains  the convolution of  the  two  input spectra, which exhibits upper 
and lower sidebands that correspond to the radio frequency signal being communicated.

13.1  Acoustic waves 

13.1.1  Introduction 

Wave phenomena are ubiquitous, so the wave concepts presented in this text are widely relevant. 
Acoustic waves  offer  an  excellent  example  because of  their  similarity  to  electromagnetic waves 
and because of their important applications.  Beside the obvious role of acoustics in microphones 
and loudspeakers, surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) devices are used as radio-frequency (RF) filters, 
acoustic-wave  modulators  diffract  optical  beams  for  real-time  spectral  analysis  of  RF  signals, 
and  mechanical  crystal  oscillators  currently  control  the  timing  of  most  computers  and  clocks. 
Because  of  the  great  similarity  between  acoustic  and  electromagnetic  phenomena,  this  chapter 
also reviews much of electromagnetics from a different perspective. 

Section 13.1.2 begins with a simplified derivation of the two main differential equations that 
characterize  linear  acoustics. This  pair  of  equations  can  be  combined  to  yield  the  acoustic wave 
equation.  Only longitudinal acoustic waves are considered here, not transverse or “shear” waves.  
These  equations  quickly  yield  the  group  and  phase  velocities  of  sound  waves,  the  acoustic 
impedance  of  media,  and  an  acoustic  Poynting  theorem.    Section  13.2.1  then  develops  the 
acoustic  boundary  conditions  and  the  behavior  of  acoustic  waves  at  planar  interfaces,  including 
an  acoustic  Snell’s  law,  Brewster’s  angle,  the  critical  angle,  and  evanescent  waves.    Section 
13.2.2  shows  how  acoustic  plane waves  can  travel within  pipes  and  be  guided  and manipulated 
much as plane waves can be manipulated within TEM transmission lines. 

Acoustic waves can be  totally reflected at firm boundaries, and Section 13.2.3 explains how 
they  can  be  trapped  and  guided  in  a  variety  of  propagation  modes  closely  resembling  those  in 
electromagnetic  waveguides,  where  they  exhibit  cutoff  frequencies  of  propagation  and 
evanescence  below  cutoff.    Section  13.2.4  then  explains  how  these  guides  can  be  terminated  at 
their ends with open or closed orifices, thus forming resonators with Q’s that can be controlled as 
in  electromagnetic  resonators  so  as  to  yield  band-stop  or  band-pass  filters.    The  frequencies  of 
acoustic resonances can be perturbed by distorting the shape of the cavity, as governed by nearly 
the  same  equation  used  for  electromagnetic  resonators  except  that  the  electromagnetic  energy 
densities  are  replaced  by  acoustic  energy  density  expressions.    Section  13.3  discusses  acoustic 
radiation  and  antennas,  including  antenna  arrays,  and  Section  13.4  concludes  the  chapter with  a 
brief introduction to representative electroacoustic devices. 

13.1.2  Acoustic waves and power 

Most  waves  other  than  electromagnetic  waves  involve  perturbations.    For  example,  acoustic 
waves  involve  perturbations  in  the  pressure  and  velocity  fields  in  gases,  liquids,  or  solids.    In 
gases  we  may  express  the  total  pressure  pT,  density  ρT,  and  velocity  u T   fields  as  the  sum  of  a 
static component and a dynamic perturbation:

(13.1.3) 

Another  complexity  is  that,  unlike  electromagnetic  variables  referenced  to  a  particular 
location,  gases  move  and  compress,  requiring  further  linearization.73      Most  important  is  the  
approximation that the mean velocity  Uo  = 0 .  After these simplifying steps we are left with two 
linearized acoustic equations, Newton’s law (f = ma) and conservation of mass:

⎡⎣

⎦
o 

(Newton’s law) 

(13.1.4)

(conservation of mass) 

(13.1.5)

Newton’s  law states  that  the pressure gradient will  induce mass acceleration, while conservation 
of  mass  states  that  velocity  divergence  ∇ • u is  proportional  to  the  negative  time  derivative  of 
mass density. 

These  two  basic  equations  involve  three  key  variables:  p,  u ,  and  ρ;  we  need  the  acoustic 
constitutive relation to reduce this set to two variables.  Most acoustic waves involve frequencies 
sufficiently  high  that  the  heating  produced  by  wave  compression  has  no  time  to  escape  by 
conduction  or  radiation,  and  thus  this  heat  energy  returns  to  the  wave  during  the  subsequent 
expansion  without  significant  loss.    Such  adiabatic  processes  involve  no  heat  transfer  across 
populations  of  particles.  The  resulting  adiabatic  acoustic  constitutive  relation  states  that  the 
fractional  change  in  density  equals  the  fractional  change  in  pressure,  divided  by  a  constant  γ, 
called the adiabatic exponent: 

∂ρ

∂ =p

ρ γ Po 
o

(13.1.6) 

The reason γ is not unity is that gas heats when compressed, which further increases the pressure, 
so  the  gas  thereby  appears  to  be  slightly  “stiffer”  or  more  resistant  to  compression  than 
otherwise.  This  effect  is  diminished  for  gas  particles  that  have  internal  rotational  or  vibrational 
degrees of  freedom so  the  temperature  rises  less upon compression.    Ideal monatomic molecules 
without such degrees of freedom exhibit γ = 5/3, and 1 < γ < 2, in general. 

Substituting  this constitutive  relation  into  the mass equation  (13.1.5)  replaces  the variable ρ 
with p, yielding the acoustic differential equations:

These  two  differential  equations  are  roughly  analogous  to  Maxwell’s  equations  (2.1.5)  and 
(2.1.6),  and  can  be  combined.    To  eliminate  u   from Newton’s  law we  operate  on  it with  (∇ •), 
and  then  substitute  (13.1.8)  for  ∇ • u   to  form  the  acoustic  wave  equation,  analogous  to  the

argument  that  is  the  sum  or  difference  of  terms  linearly  proportional  to  time  and  space  will

This is analogous to the electromagnetic dispersion relation (9.2.8). 

As  in  the  case  of  electromagnetic  waves  [see  (9.5.19)  and  (9.5.20)],  the  acoustic  phase 
velocity vp and acoustic group velocity vg are simply related to k:

1.29 [kg/m3], and Po = 1.01×105 [N/m2], yielding cs  ≅ 330 [m/s]. 

In solids or liquids the constitutive relation is:

(constitutive relation for solids and liquids)  (13.1.16) 

K  [N  m-2]  is  the  bulk  modulus  of  the  medium.    The  coefficient  1/K  then  replaces  1/γPo  in 
(13.1.8–10), yielding the acoustic velocity in solids and liquids:

⎣⎡m s −1⎦⎤ 

(acoustic velocity in solids and liquids)  (13.1.17)

Typical  acoustic  velocities  are  900  -  2000  m  s-1  in  liquids  (~1500  m  s-1  in  water),  and  1500– 
13,000 m s-1 in solids (~5900 m s-1 in steel). 

Analogous  to  (7.1.25)  and  (7.1.26),  the  acoustic  differential  equations  (13.1.8)  and  (13.1.7)

Example 13.1A 
A  loud  radio  radiates  100  acoustic  watts  at  1  kHz  from  a  speaker  10-cm  square  near  sea  level 
where  ρo  =  1.29  [kg  m-3]  and  cs  ≅  330  m  s-1.  What  are  the:  1)  wavelength,  2)  peak  pressure, 
particle velocity, and displacement, and 3) average energy density of this uniform acoustic plane 
wave in the speaker aperture? 

Solution:	 λ  =  cs/f  =  330/1000  =  33  cm.    (13.1.22)  yields  |u|  =  (2I/ηs)0.5,  and  (13.1.18)  says

13.2  Acoustic waves at interfaces and in guiding structures and resonators 

13.2.1  Boundary conditions and waves at interfaces 

The behavior of acoustic waves at boundaries is determined by the acoustic boundary conditions. 
At rigid walls the normal component of acoustic velocity must clearly be zero, and fluid pressure 
is  unconstrained  there.  At  boundaries  between  two  fluids  or  gases  in  equilibrium,  both  the 
⊥ (
)
(
)   and  the  normal  component  of  acoustic  velocity 
u r ,t   must  be 
acoustic  pressure  p r ,t
continuous.  If the pressure were discontinuous, then a finite force normal  to  the  interface would 
be acting on infinitesimal mass, giving it infinite acceleration, which is not possible.  If  u ⊥  were 
discontinuous,  then  ∂p/∂t  at  the  interface  would  be  infinite,  which  also  is  not  possible;  (13.1.8)

A uniform acoustic plane wave  incident upon a planar boundary between  two media having 
different  acoustic  properties  will  generally  have  a  transmitted  component  and  a  reflected 
component, as  suggested  in Figure 13.2.1.   The angles of  incidence,  reflection, and  transmission 
are θi, θr, and θt, respectively.

A  typical  example  is  the  boundary  between  cold  air  overlying  a  lake  and  warm  air  above;  the 
­
warm air  is  less dense, although  the pressures across  the boundary must balance.   Since  cs  ∝ ρo
0.5  and  ηs  ∝ ρo
0.5,  both  the  amplitudes  and  angles  of  propagation  must  change  at  the  density 
discontinuity. 

As  was  done  for  electromagnetic  waves  (see  Section  9.2.2),  we  can  begin  with  tentative 
general expressions for the incident, reflected, and transmitted plane waves: 

p r ( ) = p e+ jkix x − jk

(13.2.5)

At  x  =  0  the  pressure  is  continuous  across  the  boundary  (13.2.1),  so  p r ( ) + p  (r) = p  (r) ,  which
i

requires the phases (-jkz) to match: 

k iz  = k rz  = k tz  ≡ k z 

But kz is the projection of the  k  on the z axis, so kiz = kisin θi, where ki = ω/csi, and:

Thus acoustic waves refract at boundaries like electromagnetic waves (9.2.26). 

Acoustic waves can also be evanescent for θi > θc, where the critical angle θc is the angle of 
incidence (9.2.30) required by Snell’s law when θt = 90°: 

θ = sin −1(c  cst

When  θi  >  θc,  then  ktx  becomes  imaginary,  analogous  to  (9.2.32),  the  transmitted  acoustic wave 
is evanescent, and there is total reflection of the incident acoustic wave.  Thus:

power flowing in the -x direction is imaginary and the time-average real power flow is:

The  fraction  of  power  reflected  from  an  acoustic  boundary  can  be  found  by  applying  the 
boundary conditions and solving for the unknown reflected amplitude.  If we define  p  and  p

as  Γp  and  Tp  , respectively, then matching boundary conditions at x = z = 0 yields:

where we  define  the  normalized  angle-dependent  acoustic  impedance ηn  ≡ (ηtcosθi/ηicosθt)  and 
we recall kxt = ktcosθt, kt = ω/cst, and ηt = cst  ρot.  Combining (13.2.15) and (13.2.18) yields:

and  (7.2.32),  although  the  expressions  for  ηn  are  different.  The  fraction  of  acoustic  power 
reflected  is  |Γ|2.  Acoustic  impedance  η(z)   for  waves  propagating  perpendicular  to  boundaries 
therefore also are governed by (7.2.24):

The Smith chart method of Section 7.3.2 can also be used. 

There  can  even  be  an  acoustic  Brewster’s  angle  θB  when  Γ =  0,  analogous  to  (9.2.75). 
Equation  (13.2.19)  suggests  this  happens  when  ηn  =  1  or,  from  (13.2.18),  when  ηicosθt  =

Example 13.2A 
A  typical  door  used  to  block  out  sounds  might  be  3  cm  thick  and  have  a  density  of 
1000 kg m-3,  large compared  to 1.29 kg m-3 for air.  If cs = 330 m s-1  in air and 1000 m s-1  in  the 
door,  what  are  their  respective  acoustic  impedances,  ηa  and  ηd?    What  fraction  of  500-Hz 
normally  incident  acoustic  power would  be  reflected  by  the  door?    The  fact  that  the  door  is  not 
gaseous is irrelevant here if it is free to move and not secured to its door jamb. 

Solution:  	 The  acoustic  impedance  η =  ρocs  =  425.7  in  air  and  106  in  the  door  (13.1.23).  The 
impedance  at 
the 
front 
surface  of 
the  door  given  by 
(13.2.21) 
is 
ηfd  =  ηd(ηa  -  jηdtan  kz)/(ηd  -  jηatan  kz),  where  k  =  2π/λd  and  z  =  0.03.  λd  =  cd/f  = 
1000/500  =  2,  so  kz  =  πz  =  0.094,  and  tan  kz  =  0.095.  Thus ηfd  =  425.7  +  3.84  and 
|Γ|2  = 
ηfd/ηa  =  1.0090.  Using  (13.2.19) 
the  reflected  power  fraction  = 
|(ηn  –  1)/(ηn  +  1)|2  where  ηn  =  ηfd/ηa  =  1.0090,  we  find  |Γ|2  ≅ 2×10-5.  Virtually  all 
acoustic  power  passes  through.  If  this  solid  door  were  secure  in  its  frame,  shear 
forces (neglected here) would lead to far better acoustic isolation. 

13.2.2  Acoustic plane-wave transmission lines 

Acoustic  plane  waves  guided  within  tubes  of  constant  cross-section  satisfy  the  boundary 
conditions posed by stiff walls: 1) u⊥ = 0, and 2) any u// and p  is permitted.    If  these  tubes curve 
slowly  relative  to  a  wavelength  then  their  plane-wave  behavior  is  preserved.    The  viscosity  of 
gases  is  sufficiently  low  that  frictional  losses  at  the  wall  can  usually  be  neglected  in  small 
acoustic  devices.    The  resulting  waves  are  governed  by  the  acoustic  wave  equation  (13.1.20), 
which has the solutions for p, uz, and η given by (13.1.21), (13.1.22), and (13.1.23), respectively.  
Wave  intensity  is  governed  by  (13.1.26),  the  complex  reflection  coefficient  Γ is  given  by 

- 407 -


(13.2.19),  and  impedance  transformations  are  governed  by  (13.2.21).    This  set  of  equations  is 
adequate  to  solve most  acoustic  transmission  line  problems  in  single  tubes  once we model  their 
terminations. 

Two  acoustic  terminations  for  tubes  are  easily  treated:  closed  ends  and  open  ends.    The 
boundary condition posed at  the closed end of an acoustic pipe  is simply  that u = 0.   At an open 
end the pressure is sufficiently released that p ≅ 0 there.  If we intuitively relate acoustic velocity 
u(t,z)  to  current  i(z,t)  in  a TEM  line,  and p(z,t)  to voltage v(t,z),  then  a  closed pipe  is  analogous 
to an open circuit, and an open pipe is analogous to a short circuit (the reverse of what we might 
expect).75    Standing  waves  exist  in  either  case,  with  λ/2  separations  between  pressure  nulls  or 
between velocity nulls. 

13.2.3  Acoustic waveguides 

Acoustic  waveguides  are  pipes  that  convey  sound  in  one  or  more  waveguide  modes.    Section 
13.2.2  considered  only  the  special  case  where  the  waves  were  uniform  and  the  acoustic 
velocity⎯u was confined to the ±z direction.  More generally the wave pressure and velocity must 
satisfy the acoustic wave equation, analogous to (2.3.21): 

2 p

u⎩ ⎭ 

(13.2.23)

Solutions  to  (13.2.23)  in  cartesian  coordinates  are  appropriate  for  rectangular  waveguides, 
as discussed in Section 9.3.2.  Assume that two of the walls are at x = 0 and y = 0.  Then a wave 
propagating in the +z direction might have the general form:

(13.2.24)

The  choice  between  sine  and  cosine  is  dictated  by  boundary  conditions  on  u ,  which  can  be 
ωρo  (13.2.13).  Since  the  velocity  u   perpendicular  to  the  waveguide 
found  using  u = −∇p j
 
walls at x = 0 and y = 0 must be zero, so must be the gradient ∇p in the same perpendicular x and 
y  directions  at  the  walls.    Only  the  cosine  factors  in  (13.2.24)  have  this  property,  so  the  sine 
factors must be zero, yielding:

75  Although  methods  directly  analogous  to  TEM  transmission  lines  can  also  be  used  to  analyze  tubes  of  different 
cross-sections joined at junctions, the subtleties place this topic outside the scope of this text. 

- 408 -


Since  u ⊥   (i.e.  u x   and  u y )  must  also  be  zero  at  the  walls  located  at  x  =  a  and  y  =  b,  it 
 
follows  that kxa = mπ, and kyb = nπ, where m and n are  integers: 0,1,2,3,...    Substitution of any 
 
of these solutions (13.2.25) into the wave equation (13.1.9) yields:

Therefore  each  acoustic  mode  Amn  has  its  own  cutoff  frequency  ωmn  where  kz  becomes

13.2.4  Acoustic resonators 

Any closed container trapping acoustic energy exhibits resonances  just as do low-loss containers 
of electromagnetic  radiation.   We may consider a rectangular room, or perhaps a smaller box, as 
a  rectangular  acoustic  waveguide  terminated  at  its  ends  by  walls  (velocity  nulls  for  uz).   The 
acoustic waves inside must obey (13.2.27):

where  kz  =  2π/λz  has  been  replaced  by  kz  =  qπ/d  using  the  constraint  that  if  the  box  is  short-  or 
open-circuited  at  both  ends  then  its  length  d  must  be  an  integral  number  q  of  half-wavelengths 
λz/2;  therefore  d  =  qλz/2  and  2π/λz  =  qπ/d.  Thus,  analogous  to  (9.4.3),  the  acoustic  resonant

Each  resonant  mode  Amnq  corresponds  to  one  set  of  quantum  numbers  m,n,q  and  to  one  cell  in

length of a vector  from  the origin  to  the mode Amnq of  interest.   The  total number No of acoustic 
modes  with  resonances  at  frequencies  less  than  fo  is  approximately  the  volume  of  the  eighth-
sphere  shown 
in 
the  figure,  divided  by 
the  volume  of  each  cell  of  dimension

Typical  examples  of  acoustic  resonators  include  musical  instruments  such  as  horns, 
woodwinds,  organ  pipes,  and  the  human  vocal  tract.    Rooms  with  reflective  walls  are  another 
example.  In each case if we wish to excite a particular mode efficiently the source must not only 
excite it with the desired frequency, but also from a favorable location. 

One  way  to  identify  favorable  locations  for  modal  excitation  is  to  assume  the  acoustic 
source  exerts  pressure  p  across  a  small  aperture  at  the wall  or  interior  of  the  resonator,  and  then 
to compute  the  incremental acoustic  intensity  transferred  from  that  source  to  the  resonator using 
(13.1.27): 

=  e{pu
I R

(13.2.37)

In  this  expression  we  assume⎯u  is  dominated  by  waves  already  present  in  the  resonator  at  the 
resonant  frequency  of  interest  and  that  the  vector⎯u  is  normal  to  the  surface  across  which  p  is 
applied.  Therefore  pressure  sources  located  at  velocity  nulls  for  a  particular  mode  transfer  no 
power  and no  excitation occurs.  Conversely, power  transfer  is maximized  if pressure  is  applied 
at velocity maxima.  Similarly, acoustic velocity sources are best located at a pressure maximum 
of  a  desired  mode.    For  example,  all  acoustic  modes  have  pressure  maxima  at  the  corners  of 
rectangular rooms, so velocity loudspeakers located there excite all modes equally. 

The converse  is also  true.  If we wish  to damp certain acoustic modes we may put absorber 
at  their velocity or pressure maxima, depending on  the  type of absorber used.   A wire mesh  that 
introduces  drag  damps  high  velocities,  and  surfaces  that  reflect  waves  weakly  (such  as  holes  in 
pipes)  damp  pressure  maxima.    High  frequency  modes  are  more  strongly  damped  in  humid 
atmospheres  than  are  low  frequency  modes,  but  such  bulk  absorption  mechanisms  do  not 
otherwise discriminate among them. 

Because the pressure and velocity maxima are located differently for each mode, each mode 
typically  has  a  different  Q,  which  is  the  number  of  radians  before  the  total  stored  energy  wT 
decays by a factor of e-1.  Therefore the Q of any particular mode m,n,p is (7.4.34): 

Q = ω w  Pd   
o T  

(acoustic Q)  (13.2.38)

The  resonant  frequencies  and  stored  energies  are  given  by  (13.2.33)  and  (13.1.25),  respectively, 
where  it  suffices  to  compute  either  the maximum stored  kinetic  or  potential  energy,  for  they  are 
equal.  The  power  dissipated  Pd  can  be  found  by  integrating  the  intensity  expression  (13.2.37) 
over the soft walls of the resonator, and adding any dissipation occurring in the interior.

Small  changes  in  resonator  shape  can  perturb  acoustic  resonant  frequencies,  much  like 
electromagnetic  resonances  are  perturbed.    Whether  a  gentle  indentation  increases  or  lowers  a 
particular  resonant  frequency  depends  on  whether  the  time  average  acoustic  pressure  for  the 
mode  of  interest  is  positive  or  negative  at  that  indentation.    It  is  useful  to  note  that  acoustic 
energy is quantized, where each phonon has energy hf Joules where h is Planck’s constant; this is 
directly analogous  to a photon at  frequency  f.   Therefore  the  total acoustic energy  in a  resonator 
at frequency f is: 

w T  = nhf

[J] 
 

(13.2.39) 

If  the  cavity  shape  changes  slowly  relative  to  the  frequency,  the  number  n  of  acoustic 
phonons  remains  constant  and  any  change  in  wT  results  in  a  corresponding  change  in  f.  The 
work  ΔwT  done  on  the  phonon  field  when  cavity  walls  move  inward  Δz  is  positive  if  the  time 
average  acoustic  pressure  Pa  is  outward  (positive),  and  negative  if  that  pressure  is  inward  or 
negative:  ΔwT  =  PaΔz.  It  is  well  known  that  gaseous  flow  parallel  to  a  surface  pulls  on  that 
surface  as  a  result  of  the  Bernoulli  effect,  which  is  the  same  effect  that  explains  how  airplane 
wings  are  supported  in  flight  and  how  aspirators  work.    Therefore  if  an  acoustic  resonator  is 
gently  indented at a velocity maximum  for a particular  resonance,  that  resonant  frequency  f will 
be reduced slightly because  the phonon field pulling the wall inward will have done work on the 
wall.    All  acoustic  velocities  at  walls  must  be  parallel  to  them.    Conversely,  if  the  indentation 
occurs  near  pressure maxima  for  a  set  of modes,  the  net  acoustic  force  is  outward  and  therefore 
the  indentation  does  work  on  the  phonon  field,  increasing  the  energy  and  frequency  of  those 
modes. 

The most  pervasive  example  of  this  phenomenon  is  human  speech, which  employs  a  vocal 
tract  perhaps  16  cm  long,  typically  less  in women  and  all  children.   One  end  is  excited  by  brief 
pulses  in  air  pressure  produced  as  the  vocal  chords  vibrate  at  the  pitch  frequency  of  any  vowel 
being  uttered.    The  resulting  train  of  periodic  pressure  pulses  with  period  T  has  a  frequency 
spectrum consisting of  impulses spaced at T-1 Hz,  typically below 500 Hz.   The vocal  tract  then 
accentuates those impulses falling near any resonance of that tract.

Figure 13.2.3  illustrates  the  lowest  frequency acoustic  resonances possible  in pipes  that are: 
(a)  closed  at  both  ends,  (b)  open  at  both  ends,  and  (c)  closed  at  one  end  and  open  at  the  other; 
each  mode  is  designated  A001  for  its  own  structure,  where  00  corresponds  to  the  fact  that  the 
acoustic wave is uniform in the x-y plane, and 1 indicates that it is the lowest non-zero-frequency 
resonant mode.  Resonator (a) is capable of storing energy at zero frequency by pressurization (in 
the  A000  mode),  and  resonator  (b)  could  store  energy  in  the  A000  mode  if  there  were  a  steady 
velocity in one direction through the structure; these A000 modes are generally of no interest, and 
some experts do not consider them modes at all. 

A  sketch  of  the  human  vocal  tract  appears  in  Figure  13.2.4(a);  at  resonance  it  is  generally 
open  at  the mouth  and  closed  at  the  vocal  chords,  analogous  to  the  resonator  pictured  in  Figure 
13.2.3(c).  This  structure  resonates  when  its  length  D  corresponds  to  one-quarter  wavelength, 
three-quarters  wavelength,  or  generally  (2n-1)/4  wavelengths  for  the  A00n  mode,  as  sketched  in 
Figure 13.2.3(b).  For a vocal tract 16 cm long and a velocity of sound cs = 340 m s-1, the lowest 
resonant  frequency  f001 = cs/λ001 = 340/(4 × 0.16) = 531 Hz.  The next  resonances,  f2 and  f3,  fall 
at 1594 and 2656 Hz, respectively.

Figure 13.2.4  Human vocal tract. 
 

If  the  tongue  now  indents  the  vocal  tract  at  the  arrow  indicated  in  (a)  and  (b)  of  Figure 
13.2.4,  then  the  three  illustrated  resonances  will  all  shift  as  indicated  in  (c)  of  the  figure.    The 
resonance  f1  shifts  only  slightly  upward  because  the  indentation  occurs  between  the  peaks  for 
velocity  and  pressure,  but  nearer  to  the  pressure  peak.    The  resonances  shift  more  significantly 
down for f2 and up for f3 because this indentation occurs near velocity and pressure maximum for 
these  two  resonances,  respectively,  while  occurring  near  a  null  for  the  complimentary  variable. 
By simply controlling the width of the vocal tract at various positions using the tongue and teeth, 
these tract resonances can be modulated up and down to produce our full range of vowels. 

These  resonances  are  driven  by  periodic  impulses  of  air  released  by  the  vocal  cords  at  a 
pitch  controlled  by  the  speaker.    The  pitch  is  a  fraction  of  the  lowest  vocal  tract  resonant 
frequency,  and  the  impulses  are  sufficiently  brief  that  their  harmonics  range  up  to  5  kHz  and 

- 413 -


more.  Speech also  includes high-pitched broadband noise caused by  turbulent air whistling past 
the  teeth  or  other  obstacles  as  in  the  consonants  s,  h,  and  f,  and  impulsive  spikes  caused  by 
temporary tract closures, as in the consonants b, d, and p.  Speech therefore includes both voiced 
(driven  by  vocal  chord  impulses)  and  unvoiced  components.    The  spectral  content  of  most 
consonants can similarly be modulated by the vocal tract and mouth. 

It is possible to change the composition of the air in the vocal tract, thus altering the velocity 
of sound cs and the resonant frequencies of the tract, which are proportional to cs (13.2.30).  Thus 
when  breathing  helium  all  tract  resonance  frequencies  increase  by  a  noticeable  fraction, 
equivalent  to  shortening  the  vocal  tract.    Note  that  pitch  is  not  significantly  altered  by  helium 
because  the  natural  pitch  of  the  vocal  chords  is  determined  instead  primarily  by  their  tension, 
composition, and length.  

13.3  Acoustic radiation and antennas 

Any  mechanically  vibrating  surface  can  radiate  acoustic  waves.    As  in  the  case  of 
electromagnetic  waves,  it  is  easiest  to  understand  a  point  source  first,  and  then  to  superimpose 
such  radiators  in  combinations  that  yield  the  total  desired  radiation  pattern.   Reciprocity  applies 
to  linear  acoustics,  so  the  receiving  and  transmitting  properties  of  acoustic  antennas  are 
proportional, as they are for electromagnetic waves; i.e. G(θ,φ) ∝ A(θ,φ). 

The acoustic wave equation for pressure permits analysis of an acoustic monopole radiator: 

⎡ 2 
)cs

⎣∇ + ω

⎤p =
⎦

0 

(13.3.1) 

If  the acoustic radiator  is simply an  isolated sphere with a sinusoidally oscillating radius  a ,  then 
the  source  is  spherically  symmetric  and  so  is  the  solution;  thus  ∂/∂θ =  ∂/∂φ =  0.  If  we  define 
ω/cs = k, then (13.3.1) becomes: 
⎡r −2  ( 2

This can be rewritten more simply as:

(13.3.3)

This equation  is satisfied  if  r p   is an exponential, so a  radial acoustic wave propagating outward 
would have the form: 

p r ( ) = Kr  1e  jkr

 ⎡⎣N m  -2

(13.3.4) 

The  associated  acoustic  velocity  u r( )   follows  from  the  complex  form  of  Newton’s  law

(13.3.5) 

The  first  and  second  terms  in  the  solution  (13.3.5)  correspond  to  the  acoustic  far  field  and 
acoustic  near  field,  respectively.   When  kr  >>  1  or,  equivalently,  r  >>  λ/2π,  then  the  near  field 
term can be neglected, so that the far-field velocity corresponding to (13.3.4) is:

⎡⎣m s

(near-field acoustic velocity) 

u nf  = − jKrˆ(kηs r 2 )−1
Since  k  =  ω/cs,  the  near-field  velocity  is  proportional  to  ω-1,  and  becomes  very  large  at  low 
frequencies.  Thus  a  velocity  microphone,  i.e.,  one  that  responds  to  acoustic  velocity  u  rather 
than to pressure, will respond much more strongly to low frequencies than to high ones when the 
microphone  is  held  close  to  one’s  lips  (r  <<λ/2π);  this  effect  is  usually  compensated 
electronically.  The  advantage  of  velocity  microphones  is  that  they  are  largely  deaf  to  ambient 
noise  originating  in  their  far  field  (r  >>  λ/2π),  although  they  are  sensitive  to  local  wind 
turbulence. 

(13.3.7) 

The  acoustic  intensity  I(r)  can  be  computed  using  (13.1.22)  for  a  sphere  of  radius  a 
(  ) = ˆu  , and substituting this value 
r  o
 
oscillating with a surface velocity uo at r = a.  In this case  u a 
for  u  into (13.3.7) yields the constant  K ju= 
oηsa 2 ; this near-field equation is appropriate only if 
a << λ/2π.  Thus, using (13.3.4) and (13.3.6), the far field intensity is:

where 2π/λ = ω/cs has been substituted.  Thus Pt  is proportional  to ηsω2a4(uo/cs)2.  This suggests 
the  importance  of  using  a  high  frequency  ω  and  large  radius  a  if  substantial  power  is  to  be 
radiated using a velocity source  uo . 

If we imagine a Thevenin equivalent acoustic source providing a “current” of uo, then, using 
(13.3.9), the acoustic radiation resistance of this acoustic antenna is:

Arrays  of  such  acoustic  sources  can  synthesis  a  wide  variety  of  antenna  patterns  because 
superposition  applies  and  thus  acoustic  pressure  and  velocities  will  tend  to  cancel  in  some 
directions and add  in others.  For example,  two such equal sources spaced distance d along  the z 
axis,  close  compared  to  a  wavelength  and  driven  out  of  phase,  would  radiate  the  far-field 
pressure:

Thus  it  radiates  poorly  at  low  frequencies.    Its  acoustic  antenna  gain G(θ)  is  3cos2θ, which  can 
be computed by comparing  the acoustic  intensity I  to  the  total acoustic power radiated Pt,  just as 
is done for electromagnetic antennas.  That is, the acoustic gain over an isotropic radiator is:

(13.3.14)

A  common way  to  produce  this  dipole  acoustic  pattern  is  illustrated  in  Figure  13.3.1(b)  for 
the  case  of  a  loudspeaker with  no  baffling  to  block  radiation  from  the  back  side  of  its  vibrating 
speaker  cone;  the  back  side  is  clearly  180o  out  of  phase with  the  velocity  of  the  front  side.   The 
radiation from an unbaffled loudspeaker can unfortunately reflect from the walls of the room and 
interfere with the sound from the front side, reinforcing those frequencies for which the two rays 
add  in  phase,  and  diminishing  those  frequencies  for  which  they  are  out  of  phase.    As  a  result, 
most good  loudspeakers  are baffled  so  the  reverse wave  is  trapped  and  cannot  interfere with  the 
primary wave radiated forward.  This alters the acoustic impedance of the loudspeaker, but it can 

- 416 -


be  electrically  compensated.    The  result  is  an  acoustic  monopole  that  radiates  total  power  in 
proportion to p2, k2, and therefore ω2, rather than ω4 as for the dipole. 

A  linear  array  of  monopole  acoustic  sources  of  total  length  L  has  a  diffraction  pattern 
similar  to  that  for  an  array  of Hertzian  dipoles.    If  the  sources  are  all  in  phase,  then  they  radiate 
maximum power broadside (θ ≡ 0) where all rays remain in phase.  They exhibit their first null at 
θ  ≅  ±λ/L.  See  Section  10.4  for  more  discussion  of  arrays  of  radiators.    Acoustic  array 
microphones  have  similar  directional  patterns,  and  microphones  feeding  parabolic  reflectors  of 
large dimension L have even higher gains, where  the gain of an acoustic antenna  is proportional 
to its effective area.  The effective area of a parabolic reflector large compared to a wavelength is 
approximately its physical cross-section if it is uniformly illuminated without spillover, as shown 
in (11.1.25) for electromagnetic waves. 

13.4  Electrodynamic-acoustic devices 

13.4.1  Magneto-acoustic devices 

One of the most common electro-acoustic devices is the loudspeaker, where larger units typically 
employ  a magnetic  solenoid  (see Section  6.4.1)  to  drive  a  large  lightweight  cone  that  pushes  air 
with  the  driven  waveform.    The  frequency  limits  are  within  the  mechanical  resonances  of  the 
system,  which  are  the  natural  frequencies  of  oscillation  of  the  cone.    The  low  frequency 
mechanical  limit  is  typically  set by  the  resonance  of  the  rigid  cone  oscillating within  its  support 
structure.  An  upper  mechanical  limit  is  set  by  the  natural  resonance  modes  of  the  cone  itself, 
which are  lower for  larger cones because  the driven waves  typically propagate outward  from  the 
driven  center,  and  can  reflect  from  the  outer  edge  of  the  cone,  setting  up  standing  waves.    The 
amplitude  limit  is  typically  set  by  the  strength  of  the  system  and  its  linearity.    As  shown  in 
Section 6.1.2, mechanical motion can generate electric voltages in the same systems, so they also 
function as microphones. 

Another  magneto-acoustic  device  uses  magnetostriction,  which  is  the  shrinkage  of  some 
magnetic materials when  exposed  to  large magnetic  fields.   They  are  used when  small  powerful 
linear motions are desired,  typically on  the order of microns.   To obtain  larger motions  the drive 
head  can  be  connected  to  a  mechanically  tapered  acoustic  transmission  line  resembling  a  small 
solid  version  of  a  trumpet  horn  that  smoothly  matches  the  high  mechanical  impedance  of  the 
driver over  a  large  area  to  the  low mechanical  impedance of  the  small  tip.   The  small  tip moves 
much  greater  distances  because  acoustic  power  is  conserved  if  the  taper  is  slow  compared  to  a 
quarter-wavelength,  much  like  a  series  of  quarter-wave  transformers  being  used  for  impedance 
transformation;  small  tips moving  large distances  convey  the  same power  as  large  areas moving 
small  distances.    Such  acoustic-transmission-line  transformers  can  be  used  in  either  direction, 
depending on whether high displacements or high forces are desired. 

13.4.2  Electro-acoustic devices 

The  simplest  electro-acoustic  device  is  perhaps  a  capacitor  with  one  plate  that  is  free  to  move 
and  push  air  in  response  to  time-varying  electric  forces  on  it,  as  discussed  in  Section  6.2.2. 

- 417 -


These  can  be  implemented  macroscopically  or  within  micro-electromechanical  systems 
(MEMS). 

Some materials such as quartz are piezo-electric and shrink or distort when high voltages are 
place  across  them.   Because  this warping  yields  little  heat,  periodic  excitation  of  quartz  crystals 
can cause them to resonate with a very high Q, making them useful for time-keeping purposes in 
watches,  computers,  and  other  electronic  devices.    These  mechanical  resonances  for  common 
crystals  are  in  the  MHz  range  and  have  stabilities  that  are  ~10-4–10-6,  depending  mostly  on 
temperature stability; larger crystals resonate at lower frequencies.  They can also be designed to 
drive  tiny  resonant  loudspeakers  at  high  acoustic  frequencies  and  efficiencies  for  watch  alarms, 
etc. 

By  reciprocity,  good  piezo-electric  actuators  are  also  good  sensors  and  can  be  used  as 
microphones.  Mechanical distortion of such materials generates small measurable voltages.  The 
same  is  true  when  the  plate  separation  of  capacitors  is  varied,  as  shown  in  Section  6.6.1. 
Mechanically  tapered solid acoustic waveguides can also be used for  impedance  transformations 
between  low-force/high-motion  terminals  and  high-force/low  motion  terminals,  as  noted  in 
Section 13.4.1.  Levers can also be used for the same purpose. 

13.4.3  Opto-acoustic-wave transducers 

When  transparent  materials  are  compressed  their  permittivity  generally  increases,  slowing 
lightwaves  passing  through.  This  phenomenon  has  been  used  to  compute  Fourier  transforms  of 
broadband  signals  that  are  converted  to  acoustic  waves  propagating  down  the  length  of  a 
transparent  rectangular  rod.  A  uniform  plane  wave  from  a  laser  then  passes  through  the  rod  at 
right  angles  to  it  and  to  the  acoustic beam,  and  thereby  experiences  local phase  lags  along  those 
portions of  the rod where  the acoustic wave has  temporarily compressed  it.   If  the acoustic wave 
is  at  100 MHz  and  the  velocity  of  sound  in  the  bar  is  1000 m/s,  then  the  acoustic wavelength  is 
10 microns.    If  the  laser  has wavelength  1 micron,  then  the  laser  light will  pass  straight  through 
the  bar  and  will  also  diffract  at  angles  ±λ  laser/λacoustic  =  10-6/10-5  =  0.1  radian.  Several  other 
beams  will  emerge  too,  at  ~±0.2,  0.3,  etc.  [radians].  There  will  therefore  be  a  diffracted  laser 
beam at an angle unique  to each Fourier component of  the acoustic signal,  the strength of which 
depends on  the magnitude of  the associated optical phase delays along  the  rod.   Lenses can  then 
focus these various plane waves to make the power density spectrum more visible. 

If several exit ports are provided for the emerging light beams, one per angle, the laser beam 
can effectively be switched at acoustic speeds among those ports.  If 100 exit ports are provided, 
then the rod length L should be at least 100 wavelengths, or 1mm for the case cited above.  At an 
acoustic  velocity  cs  of  1000  m/s  a  new  wave  can  enter  the  device  after  L/cs  =  10-3/1000  =  10-6

13.4.4  Surface-wave devices 

Only  compressive  acoustic waves have been discussed  so  far, but  acoustic  shear waves  can  also 
be  generated  in  solids,  and  exhibit  most  of  the  same  wave  phenomena  as  compressive  waves, 
such  as  guidance  and  resonance.  The  dominant  velocity  in  a  shear  wave  is  transverse  to  the 

- 418 -


direction of wave propagation.   By generating shear waves on  the surface of quartz devices, and 
by  periodically  loading  those  surfaces mechanically with  slots  or metal, multiple  reflections  are 
induced  that,  depending  on  their  spacing  relative  to  a  wavelength,  permit  band-pass  and  band-
stop  filters  to  be  constructed,  as  well  as  transformers,  resonators,  and  directional  couplers. 
Because  quartz  has  such  high  mechanical  Q,  it  is  often  used  to  construct  high-Q  resonators  at 
MHz frequencies.

Appendix B:  Complex Numbers and Sinusoidal Representation 

Most  linear  systems  that  store  energy  exhibit  frequency  dependence  and  therefore  are  more 
easily  characterized  by  their  response  to  sinusoids  rather  than  to  arbitrary  waveforms.    The 
resulting  system  equations  contain  many  instances  of  Acos(ωt  +  φ),  where  A,  ω,  and  φ are  the 
amplitude, frequency, and phase of the sinsusoid, respectively.   Acos(ωt + φ) can be replaced by 
A  using  complex  notation,  indicated  here  by  the  underbar  and  reviewed  below;  it  utilizes  the 
arbitrary definition: 

j ≡ −1 0.5 
(
)

(B.1) 

This  arbitrary  non-physical  definition  is  exploited  by  De  Moivre’s  theorem  (B.4),  which 
utilizes a unique property of e = 2.71828: 

eφ = +1  φ + φ2  2! + φ3  3! + ... 

Therefore: 

3!+ φ4  4! + φ j  5 5! − ... 
1 j  − φ2  2! − φ 3 
e j 
φ = + φ

This is a special instance of a general complex number A: 

A A r  + jA  
= 
i

where the real part is Ar  ≡ Re{A} and the imaginary part is Ai  ≡ Im{A}. 

(B.2) 

(B.3)

(B.7) 

76 The physics community differs and commonly defines Acos(ωt + φ) = Re{Ae-j(ωt + φ) } and Ai  ≡ -Asinφ, where the 
rotational direction of φ is reversed in Figure B.1.  Because phase is reversed in this alternative notation, the 
impedance of an inductor L becomes -jωL, and that of a capacitor becomes j/ωC.  In this notation j is commonly 
replaced by -i.

(B.8) 

The  definition  of  A  given  in  (B.8)  has  the  useful  geometric  interpretation  shown  in  Figure 
B.1(a),  where  the  magnitude  of  the  phasor  A  is  simply  the  given  amplitude  A  of  the  sinusoid, 
and the angle φ is its phase.

Figure B.1  Representation of phasors in the complex plane. 
 

When φ = 0 we have Re{Aejωt} = Acosωt, and when φ = π/2 we have -Asinωt.  Advances in time 
alter  the phasor A  in  the same sense as advances  in φ;  the phasor  rotates counterclockwise.   The 
utility  of  this  diagram  is  partly  that  the  signal  of  interest,  Re{Aejωt},  is  simply  the  projection  of 
the phasor Aejωt on the real axis.  It also makes clear that: 
A = (A 2
2 )0.5	
r  + Ai

(B.9) 

φ = tan −1(Ai  A r )	

(B.10) 

It is also easy to see, for example, that ejπ = -1, and that A = jA corresponds to -Asinωt. 

Examples of equivalent representations in the time and complex domains are: 

Acos  tω ↔  A

jA

−Asinωt  ↔

Acos (ω + φ  ↔

also illustrated in Figure B.1(b) and (c), respectively:
