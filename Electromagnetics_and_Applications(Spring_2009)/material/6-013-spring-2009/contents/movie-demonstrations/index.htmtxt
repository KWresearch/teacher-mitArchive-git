        through a slotted rectangular aperture.
        This movie demonstrates the propagation of a
7       modulated pulse through a dispersive plasma      (MPEG_-_1.7MB) Â 
        media.
        This movie demonstrates the phase difference and
8       the amplitude decay of the E and H field in a    (MPEG_-_1.0MB) (TXT)
        very lossy medium.
        This movie demonstrates the phase difference and
9       the amplitude decay of the E and H field in a    (MPEG)         (TXT)
        plasma medium.
