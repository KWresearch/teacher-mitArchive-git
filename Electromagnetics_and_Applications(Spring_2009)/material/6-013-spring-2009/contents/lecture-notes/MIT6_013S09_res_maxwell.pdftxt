Brief History of Maxwell's Equations  


Andre-Marie Ampere - 1775 – 1836 - French physicist 

In  1820,  a  week  after  Ampere  heard  of  H.  C.  Ørsted's  1806 
discovery  that  a  magnetic  needle  is  acted  on  by  a  voltaic  current,
he  presented  a  paper  to  the  Academy  containing  a  far  more 
complete exposition of that and related phenomena. 

Ampere,  the  unit  of  current,  and  "Ampere's  law"  are  named  after 
him.  Oersted is a unit of magnetic field.

∂t 

Ampere's Law:   ∇ × H J
= + 

Carl Friedrich Gauss – 1777-1855 - German mathematician 

Independently  stated  Green's  theorem,  generalized  Coulomb’s 
law,  and  formulated  separate  electrostatic  and  electrodynamic 
laws,  including  "Gauss's  laws",  which  constitute  two  of  the  four 
"Maxwell's equations." 

Gauss's Laws:  ∇iD = ρ,  ∇iB = 0 

Michael Faraday  - 1791-1867 - British experimentalist 

Discovered  that  moving  a  magnet  near  a  loop  of  wire  causes  an 
electrical current to flow; this led to Faraday’s law of induction. 

Farad  (unit  of  capacitance)  and  "Faraday's  law"  are  named  after 
him; also the Faraday effect (optics) and the Faraday cage. 

Faraday's Law:   ∇ × E = −

∂t 

James Clerk Maxwell - 1831-1879 - Scottish physicist 

Converted  Faraday’s  physical  ideas  into  a  mathematical  model. 
Suggested  that  Faraday’s  law  of  induction  implies  a  corresponding 
“displacement current  ∂D ” that yields electromagnetic waves. 
∂t 

Maxwell's  four  equations  (above)  suggested  that  electromagnetic 
waves  could  be  generated  in  the  laboratory,  a  possibility  first 
demonstrated  by  Heinrich  Hertz  in  1887,  eight  years  after 
Maxwell's death.
