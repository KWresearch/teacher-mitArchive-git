SUMMARY

Wireless communications are ubiquitous

G(θ,φ) = I(θ,φ,r) / (Pt/4πr2) = Antenna gain over isotropic
Boost antenna gain using lenses, mirrors, or phasing
Ar = Gr (λ2/4π) = Antenna effective area [m2]
M [bps] = Prec/Eb = IAe/Eb = PtGtGr(λ/4πr)2/Eb = data rate
Eb > ~10-20 [J] at the receiver    (see footnote 39 on p360)
Antennas have Thevenin equivalent circuits, radiation resistance
