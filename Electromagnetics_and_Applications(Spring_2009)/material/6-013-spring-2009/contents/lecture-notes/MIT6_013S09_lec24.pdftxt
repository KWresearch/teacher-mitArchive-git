Wave equation:
∂/∂θ = ∂/∂φ = 0      (radial source) 
d2p/dr2 + (2/r)dp/dr + k2p = 0
Yields:
d2(rp)/dr2 + k2(rp) = 0
Equivalent to:

Since                      therefore:

EXCITATION OF RESONATORS
TEM Resonators (with loss):
Vo
Voltage null
I(t) =  Io cos ωot
V(δ,t) = Vo cos(ωot + φ) sin(2πδ/d)
φ =  0 exactly at resonance
Pin(t) ≅ IoVo cos2(ωot) sin(2πδ/d)  [W]
= 0 at voltage nulls
δ
Cannot excite TEMm modes by driving current into voltage nulls!  (Or 
by voltage sources in series at current nulls). Pin(t) = 0 in both cases.
Acoustic Resonators:

Cannot excite acoustic modes with:
velocity sources at pressure nulls (pk = 0), or
pressure sources at velocity nulls (vk = 0)
