RESONATOR Q
General derivation of Q (all resonators):
wT ≅ wToe-ω’t/Q
(total stored energy [J])
Pd = -dwT/dt ≅ (ω’/Q)wT (power dissipated [W])
Q ≅ ω’wT/Pd *                  (resonator Q [“radians” is dimensionless])
Internal, external, and loaded Q (QI, QE, QL):
(PdI is power dissipated internally, in R)
QI  = ω’wT/PdI
QE = ω’wT/PdE (PdE is power dissipated externally, in RTh)
(PdT is the total power dissipated, in R and RTh)
QL = ω’wT/PdT
