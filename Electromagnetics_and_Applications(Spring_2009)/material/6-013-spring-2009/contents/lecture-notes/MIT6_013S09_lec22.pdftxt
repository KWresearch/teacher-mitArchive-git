Assume:     Two-level system, E2 > E1, and ni = atoms m-1 in state i
Then:          dn2/dt = - An2 - B(n2 – n1) [m-1s-1]   (collisionless system)

PUMPING OF LASERS
Two-Level Lasers:
Radiation pumping alone never yields n2 > n1
(some 2-level lasers spatially isolate n2 group)
Three-Level Lasers:
Pumping the 1-3 transition yields n1 ≅ n3
Large A32 populates L2 so n2 >> n1 ≅ n3 ≅ 0

Pump

More levels can utilize transitions with larger A’s
Large A23 fills L2, and large A41 empties L4
Laser Power Efficiency (Pout/Pin ):
Intrinsic efficiency:  ηi = fL/fp (P ∝ nhf [W]) < 1
B/A efficiency @ 2: ηB = B21/(A21+B21) < 1
A/A efficiency @ 3: ηA = A32/(A31+A32) < 1
Total efficiency:
η = ηiηBηA
Pump photons s-1 ∝ B >> A ∝ ω3, so x-ray  
lasers need pump power ∝ hfB ∝ hfA ∝ ω4

LASER OSCILLATORS
Laser Oscillation:
With perfect mirrors at 
Lossless:
both ends a lossless
amplifier must oscillate 
Amplifier
and saturate
Round-trip gain must exceed round-trip loss (threshold 
condition); gain ∝ pump power Pp, so need Pp > Pthresh
Exit mirror has power transmission coefficient T > 0
At threshold, Gain ≅ Loss, so:
P+(1 – T)e2(g-α)L ≥ P+
⇒ round-trip gain = e2(g-α)L ≥ 1/(1 – T) for oscillation
Pout

Mirrors:

Lossy:

Q-switching:    Set mirror reflectivity low ⇒
round-trip gain < threshold. 
When laser is fully pumped, 
increase mirror reflectivity 
over threshold, yielding very 
large “Q-switched pulse”

Laser Output Spectrum:
If every atom can amplify at all frequencies, then 
the strongest round-trip gain wins ⇒ line narrowing   
(homogeneous line broadening)
If atoms can amplify only a portion of the band, 
then all lines over threshold can yield output       
(inhomogeneous line broadening)
