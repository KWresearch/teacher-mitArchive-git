Quiz 2	

Closed book, no calculators 

Please note the formulas provided on a separate sheet.  There are 4 problems on two pages. For 
full  credit,  please  simplify  all  expressions,  circle  and  dimension  your  answers,  and  present 
numerical answers to the extent practical without a calculator or tedious computation.  You may 
leave natural constants in symbolic form (, o, h, e, etc.).  You may keep the quiz questions. 

Problem 1. (28/100 points) 

The  voltage  v(t)  at  the  input  end  of  the  illustrated  lossless  air-filled  100-ohm  TEM  line  of 
length  D  is  illustrated  for  the  case  where  the  Thevenin  voltage  source  is  a  step  function  of 
amplitude A, and the source impedance is RTh. 
RTh 

D 

a)	 What  is  the  numerical  value  of  RTh? 
Briefly explain your reasoning (required). 

b)	 What is the line length D?

c)	 Diagram  a  simple  load  at  the  end  of  the  line  that  could  produce  this  response;  it  is  not 
necessary  to  compute  element  values.  Simply  label  your  components  as  R,  L,  or  C,  as 
necessary. 

Problem 2.  (22/100 points) 

A  certain  parallel-plate  TEM  transmission  line  is  1  cm wide  and  1  mm  high,  and  is  filled 
with a medium characterized by μo  and ε = 9εo. 
a)	 What is the approximate wavelength λ (numerical value) for a 1-GHz signal on this line? 
b)	 Assume  a  sinusoidal  signal  propagates  in  the  +z  direction  as  |V(z)|  =  Voe-z  and  that  ε  = 
9εo(1 + 0.01j).  What are the sign and approximate numerical value of  at 1 GHz?

Problem 3.  (22/100 points) 

The magnetic fieldH for y > 0 in vacuum isH = 

Hoe-jz - 0.6y.
a)  Explain completely but very briefly whether this is a TE or TM wave. 

b)  What is the approximate angular frequency  [r/s] of this wave? 

Problem 4.  (28/100 points) 

A vacuum-filled 100-ohm TEM transmission line is terminated with a complex load ZL. 
(a)  What is the numerical value of the inductance L [Hy/m] for this line? 

(b) 	 The  magnitude  of  the  voltage  |V(z)|  is 
measured on  this  line  as  illustrated.  The 
VSWR  =  3.  What  fraction  F  of  the 
power  incident  upon  the  load  is  being 
reflected?
