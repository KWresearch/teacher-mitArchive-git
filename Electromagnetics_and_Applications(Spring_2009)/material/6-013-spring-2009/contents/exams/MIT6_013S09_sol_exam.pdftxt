Please  note  the  two  pages  of  formulas  provided  at  the  back;  the  laser  and  acoustic 
expressions  have  been  revised  slightly.    There  are  10  problems;  some  are  on  the  back 
sides  of  the  sheets.   For  full  credit,  please  simplify  all  expressions,  present  numerical 
answers  to  the extent practical without a calculator or  tedious computation, and place 
your  final  answers  within  the  boxes  provided.      You  may  leave  natural  constants  and 
trigonometric  functions  in  symbolic  form  (,  o, o, o,  h,  e,  sin(0.9),
,  etc.).    To 
receive  partial  credit,  provide  all  related  work  on  the  same  sheet  of  paper  and  give 
brief explanations of your answer.  Spare sheets are at the back.

Problem 1. (25/200 points) 
 

Two  square  capacitor  plates  in  air  have 
separation  d,  sides  of  length  b,  and  charge  ±Q  as 
illustrated.  Fringing fields can be neglected. 
 
a)  What is the capacitance Ca of this device? 
 
 
 

Ca = oA/d = ob2/d 

b)  A  perfectly  conducting  plate  is  introduced 
between  the  capacitor  plates,  leaving  parallel  gaps 
of width d/10 above and below itself.  What now is 
the device capacitance Cb when it is fully inserted? 
Cb = Ca’/2 = ob2/2(d/10) = 5ob2/d

c)  What  is  the magnitude  and  direction  of  the  forcef  on  the  new  plate  of Part  (b)  as  a 
function of  the  insertion distance L.   Please express your answer as a function of  the

The  plate  separation  of  a  lossless  parallel-plate  TEM  line many wavelengths  long 
(length  D  =  100.25λ)  very  slowly  increases  from  end  A  to  end  B,  as  illustrated.    This 
increases  the  characteristic  impedance  of  the  line  from Zo  at  the  input  end A,  to  4Zo  at 
the  output  end  B.    This  transition  from  A  to  B  is  so  gradual  that  it  produces  no 
reflections.  End B is terminated with a resistor of value 4Zo
