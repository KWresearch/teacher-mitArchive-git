Final Exam
 Closed book, no calculators 
Please  note  the  two  pages  of  formulas  provided  at  the  back;  the  laser  and  acoustic 
expressions  have  been  revised  slightly.  There  are  10  problems;  some  are  on  the  back 
sides  of  the  sheets.  For  full  credit,  please  simplify  all  expressions,  present  numerical 
answers  to  the extent practical without a calculator or  tedious computation, and place 
your  final  answers  within  the  boxes  provided.  You  may  leave  natural  constants  and 
 
trigonometric  functions  in  symbolic  form  (π, εo, μo, ηo,  h,  e,  sin(0.9),  2 ,  etc.).    To 
receive  partial  credit,  provide  all  related  work  on  the  same  sheet  of  paper  and  give 
brief explanations of your answer.  Spare sheets are at the back.

Problem 2.  (20/200 points) 

The  plate  separation  of  a  lossless  parallel-plate  TEM  line many  wavelengths  long 
(length  D  =  100.25λ)  very  slowly  increases  from  end  A  to  end  B,  as  illustrated.    This 
increases  the  characteristic  impedance  of  the  line  from Zo  at  the  input  end A,  to  4Zo  at 
the  output  end  B.  This  transition  from  A  to  B  is  so  gradual  that  it  produces  no 
reflections.  End B is terminated with a resistor of value 4Zo
