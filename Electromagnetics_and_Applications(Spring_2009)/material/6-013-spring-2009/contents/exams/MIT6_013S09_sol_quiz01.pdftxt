Quiz 1 Solutions 

Problem 1. (34/100 points) 

E = 2 

andH = 

. 

a) 

b)  Wave intensity I = 

c)  η = E/H = 2.  μ = η/v = 

= 2×1 = 2 [H/m] 

d)  Pressure Pm  = Wm  = 

where |H| = 2 at s = ∞.  Pm = 

= 2 [N/m2] 

Problem 2. (18/100 points) 

fe = -e( 

) = 0   Ey = -vmB.  But V = Ey W   vm = - Ey/B = - V/WB 

Problem 3. (20/100 points) 

H//  is continuous since  = 0  Js = 0 . 
When μ = ∞ and μH is finite (finite Wm), H = 0, soH//  = 0. 

Problem 4. (28/100 points)


a)  Ampere’s Law: πDH = NI  H = NI/πD  [A/m] 

(points counterclockwise)


b)  L = /I.   = NAμoH.  So L = NAμoNI/πDI =  μoN2A/πD [H] 


c)  μ  0.01×1000μo  + 0.99μo  = 10.99 μo; A  A/100, so  L  L’ = 10.99 μoN2A/πD [H]
