Quiz 1 

Closed book, no calculators 

Please note the formulas provided on a separate sheet.  There are 4 problems on two pages. For 
full  credit,  please  simplify  all  expressions,  circle  and  dimension  your  answers,  and  present 
numerical answers to the extent practical without a calculator or tedious computation.  You may 
leave natural constants in symbolic form (, o, h, e, etc.).  You may keep the quiz questions. 

Problem 1. (34/100 points) 

A uniform plane wave in an unusual gaseous medium characterized by μ,ε is represented by: 
E = 2 
andH = 
. 
In each case below please briefly indicate your method, equations, or reasoning. 
What are the numerical values for: 
a)  The wave velocity v and direction [m/s]? 
b)  The time average wave intensity I [W/m2]? 
c)  The permeability μ [H/m] for this medium? 
d)  The  pressure  Pm  [N/m2]  the  wave  exerts  when  normally 
incident (θi  = 0) on a perfectly reflecting mirror? 

Problem 2. (18/100 points) 

A  factory  measures  the  velocity  vm  [m/s]  of  molten 
metal  running  down  an  insulating  sluice  of  width  W  by 
measuring  the  voltage  V  across  the  width  of  the  channel 
produced  by  the  illustrated  uniform  vertical  magnetic 
field  B.  What  is  the  velocity  vm  in  terms  of  the  other 
given  parameters?  Briefly  explain  your  reasoning, 
including the direction ofvm  (see illustration).

What  constraints  are  imposed  on  H//  in  free  space  at  the  flat  surface  of  a  medium  having 
=  0 and μ =  ∞?  Briefly explain your reasoning. 

Problem 4. (28/100 points) 

The  illustrated  inductor  consists  of  N  turns  of 
wire  uniformly  wound  around  a  thin  hollow  toroid 
with  a  major  diameter  of  D  to  produce  an 
inductance  of  L  [Henries].  The  toroid  cross-
sectional  area  is  A,  as  illustrated,  and  you  may 
neglect any fields outside the toroid. 
a)	 What  is  H  inside  the  toroid  when  the  current 
through the coil is I Amperes? 
b)	 What  is  the  approximate  inductance  L  of  this 
inductor? 
c)	 The  core  of  this  coil  is  now  one-percent  filled 
with  many  turns  of  iron  wire  having  μ  = 
1000μo,  as  illustrated.  What  now  is  the 
inductance L?
