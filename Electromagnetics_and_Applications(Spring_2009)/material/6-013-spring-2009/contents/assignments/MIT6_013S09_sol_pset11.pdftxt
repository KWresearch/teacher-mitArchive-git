Problem  Set  11  Solutions 

Problem  11.0 

The easiest way to approach this problem is to pretend that the roof antennas are transmitting to an antenna 
at  the horizon.  Then  for  each  antenna  orientation, we  can ﬁnd  the  image  antenna  and  the distance  from  the 
roof  that  we  need  to  place  the  antenna  to maximize  transmission  towards  the  horizon. 

(a) 

A horizontally polarized  transmitter at  the horizon would  require  that our antenna be horizontal also  (along 
yˆ from  the  diagram).  The  image  of  an  antenna  parallel  to  a  conducting  surface  and  height  h  above  the 
surface  is  the  same  antenna  half  a  wavelength  out  of  phase  in  time  a  depth  h  below  the  surface.  This  is 
shown  in  the  ﬁgure. 

The  diﬀerence  in  path  length  for  the  roof-top  antenna  and  its  image  when  looking  toward  the  horizon  will 
be  D ,  the  height  of  the  antenna  above  the  roof.  In  order  to  have  a  maximum  toward  the  horizon  we  need 
the  total  phase  delay  for  the  image  to  be  λ  so  we  need  the  height  D  to  be  λ/2. 

The  antenna  should  be  oriented  along  ˆy  and  placed  D = λ/2  above  the  roof  surface. 

(b) 

This  case  is  a  little  more  diﬃcult  to  solve.  To  receive  a  vertically  polarized  signal  from  the  horizon  (signal 
polarized  along  ˆx)  the  antenna  needs  to  have  it’s  axis  in  the  x-z  plane.  For  any  antenna  orientation  in 
this  plane  we  can  break  the  problem  into  an  antenna  polarized  perpendicular  to  the  roof  and  an  antenna 
polarized parallel  to  the  roof  (see diagram).  In both cases  the physical path  length diﬀerence  looking  toward 
the  horizon  is  the  height  of  the  antenna  above  the  roof D . 

For  the  antenna  polarized  perpendicular  to  the  roof,  the  antenna  and  it’s  image  are  in  phase  in  time  so  we 
need  the  path  length  diﬀerence  to  be  λ.  The  total  electric  ﬁeld  in  this  case will  be  twice  the  ﬁeld  of  a  single 
antenna  at  an  angle  Θ = 60◦  from  the  dipole  axis.

For  the  antenna  polarized  parallel  to  the  roof,  the  antenna  and  it’s  image  are  out  of  phase  by λ/2  in  time  so 
we  need  the  path  length  diﬀerence  to  be D = λ/2.  The  total  electric  ﬁeld  in  this  case  will  be  twice  the  ﬁeld

The  ﬁeld  for  any  antenna  will  fall  between  the  two  expressions  above,  so  we  know  that  the  best  we  can  do 
is  to  mount  the  antenna  perpendicular  to  the  roof  at  a  height D = λ  above  the  roof. 

(c) 

The maximum  ﬁeld  due  to  a  half  wave  dipole,  using  the  notation  above,  is

The  E  will  be  larger  in  this  case  than  for  a  short  dipole.

Problem  11.1 

(a) 

To  get  the  voltage  induced  on  the  receiving  antenna  we  can  use  equation  10.3.19, 
VT H  = −E ¯  def f ¯ 
· 
The  wavelength  of  a  1  MHz  signal  is  300m,  so  we  can  say  our  receiving  dipole  is  short,  and  the  eﬀective 
length  is  half  the  physical  length. 

I  = 

Let us assume that the transmitting dipole is also a short dipole, so it will have a maximum gain of 1.5.  Since 
we  want  the maximum  voltage  induced  on  the  dipole  lets  assume  that  we  place  the  receiver  in  the  direction 
of maximum  gain  for  the  transmitter,  and  that  the  receiver  is  aligned with  the  electric ﬁeld produced by  the 
transmitter.

A  diagram  of  the  system  is  given  below.  Notice  that  the  image  antenna  is  half  a  wavelength  out  of  phase 
(in  time)  with  the  actual  antenna. 

To  solve  this  problem we  need  to  ﬁnd  the  total  ﬁeld  at  the  receiving  antenna.  This  is  simply  the  sum  of  the 
ﬁeld  due  to  the  antenna  (ignoring  the  ground  plane)  and  the  ﬁeld  due  to  it’s  image.  The  general  expression 
for  the  far  ﬁeld  electric  ﬁeld  due  to  a  dipole  of  length  def f  driven  with  current  I  is:

At  1-MHz,  λ = 300  [m]  so  if  h << ra  = 1000  [m]  we  can  assume  that  h2  << raλ  so  e−j 2kh2

If  we  assume  that  a  damp  earth  conducts  fairly  well,  than  the  results  of  parts  (b)  and  (c)  suggest  that  an 
AM  broadcast  radio  station  operating  near  1-MHz  should  use  vertically  polarized  antennas. 

The  results  from  parts  (b)  and  (c)  required  that  h2  << raλ.  This  was  true  at  1-MHz  where  the  wavelength 
was 300 meters, but we don’t know if this will be true for 1-GHz where the wavelength is 0.3 meters.  Consider 
the  case  of  h =  10[m].  h2  =  100 <<  1000 × 300,  but  h2  =  100! <<  1000 × 0.3.  So  this  argument  does  not 
apply  to  cell  phones  operating  above  1-GHz.

Problem  11.2 

(a)
 

We  want  to  ﬁnd  the  frequency  separation  between  adjacent  nulls.  For  the  ﬁrst  null  we  know  that 
kL1  − kL2  =  k(L1  − L2 ) =  nπ  with  n  odd  (because  the  path  length  diﬀerence  has  to  be  and  odd  multiple 
of  half  a  wavelength).  We  can  re-write  this  in  terms  of  frequency: 
k(L1  − L2 ) = f 2π (L1  − L2 ) = nπ ,  or 
c

f  =  2  L1−L2 
,  with  n  odd.

The  next  null  will  occur  when  the  path  length  diﬀerence  is  now  n + 2  times  half  the  wavelength. 
f2  =  (n+2)c

This  suggests  that  the  6-MHz  wide  TV  signals  will  have  problems  with  multipath  propagation  with  path 
length  diﬀerences  in  the  1  km  range. 

(b) 

To  give  a  good  answer  we  would  have  to  have  a  better  idea  of  how  many  nulls  we  could  tolerate  in  any 
one  sub-band.  If  we  assume  that  just  one  null  in  the  sub-band  would  be  ok,  then  we  want  the  individual 
sub-bands  to be 0.3 MHz  (N=20)  for  this  type of problem.  In  the best  case  this would put  the nulls between 
adjacent  sub-bands,  and  in  the  worst  case  there  would  be  one  null  in  each  of  the  sub-bands.

his  problem  is  to  solve  for  the  total  far  ﬁeld  electric  ﬁeld  in  the  variables  Θ  and 
φ  as  deﬁned  for  the  diagra
m.  The  easiest  way  to  get  the  far  ﬁeld  pattern  is  to  recognize  that  the  total  ﬁeld 
will  be  the  product  of  the 
far  ﬁeld  pattern  for  a  single  patch  with  the  array  factor  for  two  antennas  driven 
in  phase  but  separated  by  200λ  along  the  ˆy  axis. 
We  can  get  the  far ﬁeld  of  a  single patch  antenna  from  equation  11.1.15 by  substituting  100λ  for Lx  and Lz ,

There  are  two  approaches  to  the  problem.  The  ﬁrst  is  to  evaluate  the  square  sinc  function  at  the  ﬁrst  two 
maxima  of  |E |2  in  the  x-z  plane.  The  second  is  to  look  at  the  vector  addition  that  represents  the  complex 
addition  of  the  phase  terms  corresponding  to  the  integral  over  the  aperture. 

First  lets  look  at  the maxima  of  sinc2 (x).  We  know  the  ﬁrst  occurs  at  x = 0, with  value  1.  To  ﬁnd  the  next 
maxima we  could  take  the  derivative  of  sinc2 (x)  and  set  it  equal  to  zero  and  then  evaluate  to  see  if we’re  at 
a  zero  or  maxima.  The  easier  method  is  to  recognize  that  the  local  minima  and  maxima  of  sinc(x)  are  the 
points  we’re  looking  for.

To  solve  this  problem  graphically,  see  the  attached  diagram. 

The  ﬁrst  maxima  occurs  when  all  the  vectors  have  zero  imaginary  part,  and  is  proportio
nal  to  D.  The  ﬁrst 
zero  occurs  when  the  vector  sum  starts  and  ends  at  the  same  point  (forms  a  circle  with
  circumference  D). 
The  next  maxima  occurs  when  the  vector  sum  forms  a  circle  and  ends  halfway  around 
the  circle  from  the 
start.  In  this  case  the  circumference  of  the  circle  is  C  =  D2/3 =  πA,  so  A  (which  is 
proportional  to  the 
magnitude  of  the  sinc  function)  is  A = D  2  .

So  the  required  antenna  eﬀective  area  is  7.8 × 10−5 [m2 ]. 
Note  that  the  actual  distance  is  closer  to  3 × 105  km,  which  gives  us  an  area  of  78  [m2 ] 
(c) 
� 
The  eﬀective  area  of  an  aperture  antenna  is  approximatly  the  physical  area  of  the  aperture.  We  can  assume 
that  the  antenna  is  square,  then  the  length  of  each  side  is  Lx  = Ly  =  Aef f .

From  equation  11.1.26  we  know  that  the  ﬁrst  null  will  occur  at  an  angle

Θn  = ±.

� 
So  the  spot  size  on  the  ground  will  be

W  = 2rtan(Θn ) = 2rtan(asin(λ/  Aef f ))

For  the  distance  3 × 105  [m]  this  becomes:

W  = 2(3 × 105 )tan(asin(0.003/0.00883)) = 2.002 × 105  [m] between  the ﬁrst nulls.  The area associated with 

this  is  S pot  Area = W 2  = 4.008 × 1010  [m2 ]

For  the  distance  3 × 105  [km]  this  becomes: 

W  = 2(3 × 108 )tan(asin(0.003/8.83)) = 2.04 × 105  [m] between  the ﬁrst nulls.  The area associated with  this

is  S pot  Area = W 2  = 4.15 × 1010  [m2 ] 
(d) 

If  the  spot  size  is  smaller  than  the  diameter  of  the  earth  (which  we’re  told  to  assume)  than  we  can  say  that

the  ﬁeld  of  view  of  the  antenna  is  ﬁlled  with  the  earth  at  a  brightness  temperature  of  TB  = 250K .  We  can

use  the  result  of  section  11.3.3  to  say  that  the  antenna  temperature  is  now  TR  =  TB  =  250K .  This  is  2.5

times  the  previous  value,  so  our  eﬀective  area  (which  grows  linearly  with  the  reciever  thermal  noise  power)

will  be  2.5  times  it’s  previous  value.

Aef f ,  new  = 2.5 × Aef f ,  old

For  the  distance  3 × 105  [m]  this  becomes  A = 1.95 × 10−4  [m2 ]

For  the  distance  3 × 105  [km]  this  becomes  A = 195  [m2 ]
