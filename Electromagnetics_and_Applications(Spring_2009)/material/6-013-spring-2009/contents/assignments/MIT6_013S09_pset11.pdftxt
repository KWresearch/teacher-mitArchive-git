Problem 11.0	
(a)  	 Some homeowners have  flat metal  roofs  sloped at 
30o  directly  toward  the  transmitter,  as  illustrated, 
and  use  a  single  half-wave  dipole  antenna 
30ο
metal roof 
mounted a distance D from the roof (see figure).    
If  the  transmitted  signal  is horizontally polarized  and  arrives  from  the horizon, what 
should D be in order to optimize reception, and how should the antenna be oriented? 
Assume the surface of the earth is absorbing. 
(b)  Repeat  (a)	  for  a  vertically  polarized  transmitter. 
  This  is  tricky  but  not 
computationally  difficult.    You  might  want  to  think  of  the  antenna  as  transmitting 
toward the horizon. 
(c)  What  is  the  increase  or  decrease  R  in  receiver  antenna  gain  G  (dB)  toward  the 
transmitter  relative  to  the  gain  for  (b)  if  the  roof  were  removed  and  the  dipole 
antenna were reoriented in an optimum manner?  A power ratio R in dB is 10 log10R.

Problem 11.1 
(a)  	 What  is  the  maximum  Thevenin  open-circuit  voltage  V  produced  in  a  short  dipole 
antenna of  length L = 1 m by a 1-kW 1-MHz  transmitter at distance r = 1 km away? 
Neglect all reflections. 
(b) 	 What  is  this maximum open-circuit voltage V(h)  for Part  (a)  if both  the  transmitting 
and  receiving  antennas  are  horizontally  polarized  short  dipoles  located  at  height  h 
above a parallel perfectly conducting infinite flat surface?  Assume h << r = 1 km. 
(c)  Repeat (b) for vertical polarization. 
(d)  	 If we assume a damp earth conducts fairly well, what do your answers  to (b) and (c) 
suggest concerning  the best choice of polarization  from AM broadcast  radio stations 
operating  near  1  MHz?    Does  this  polarization  argument  apply  to  cell  phones 
operating above 1 GHz?  Explain briefly. 
Problem 11.2 
(a)  A  100-MHz  digital  high-definition  television  signal  arrives  at  a  receiver  via  two 
equal-strength paths  in phase, one path being 10 km  long and  the other 11 km.   This 
is  called  “multipath”  propagation  whenever more  than  one  delay  is  involved.    Over 
approximately what maximum contiguous bandwidth B  [Hz] near 100 MHz can  this

channel  be  used  without  the  two  rays  adding  to  produce  a  null,  i.e.,  what  is  the 
frequency  separation  between  nulls?  What does  this  suggest  about  the vulnerability 
to  multipath  of  over-the-air  HDTV  broadcasting  of  6-MHz  wide  TV  signals? 
Discuss briefly. 
(b)  	 An  alternate  HDTV  broadcast  format  (not  in  the  USA)  uses  OFDM  (orthogonal 
frequency  domain  multiplexing)  in  which  the  digital  signal  is  divided  into  many 
separate  digital  streams  that  are  each  broadcast  within  one  of  N  distinct  adjacent 
narrow  frequency  bands  that  together  make  up  the  total  frequency  allocation  for  an 
HDTV  channel,  say  6  MHz.    If  we  assume  the  geometry  of  part  (a),  then  what 
bandwidth  B’  would  you  recommend  for  these  individual  sub-bands,  and  why? 
Equipment costs generally increase with N.

Problem 11.3 
Two  square  uniformly  illuminated  aperture 
antennas  of  length  D  are  spaced  D  apart  as 
illustrated,  and  transmit  at  wavelength  λ  = 
D/100. 
(a)  	 At  what  magnitude  angle  |θ|  in  the  x-z 
plane does the first null occur? 
(b)  	 At what magnitude angles |φ| in the y-z plane do the first three nulls occur? 
(c)  Returning to Part (a), approximately what is the gain of the first sidelobe GSL relative 
to  the  on-axis  gain  Go  (i.e.,  GSL/Go  ≅  ?)?    Hint: 
the  far-field  electric  vector 
magnitude  |E(θ)|  is  the  sum  of  phasor  contributions  from  each  of  the  sub-apertures, 
each sub-aperture being at a slightly different distance from the observer.  Each such 
phasor  has  the  same magnitude,  and  their  phases  are  equally  spaced  at  an  angle  that 
depends  on  θ.  At  maximum  gain  all  phasors  have  the  same  phase,  so  they  add 
linearly;  at  other  angles  θ  their  phases  differ  so  they  sum  to  a  smaller  total.   Briefly 
sketch your phasor addition for the peak of the first sidelobe.

Problem 11.4 
Let’s design  a 100-GHz  communications  link between Earth and  the moon  that can  send 
a 10 kbps cell phone signal  to an aperture antenna on  the moon  that points directly at  the 
1-watt  isotropic  cell-phone  transmitter.   The  excellent  lunar  receiver has  a  receiver noise 
temperature  TR  of  100K  over  the  operating  bandwidth  of  5  kHz.    Assume  we  need  to 
receive ten times the receiver thermal noise power in order to decode the voice signal. 
(a) 	 What is the thermal noise power PTh [W] for this lunar receiver? 
(b) 	 What receiver antenna effective area Ae is required on the moon? 
(c)  Approximately what  size  spot on  the ground within  the  first nulls  is viewed by your 
lunar antenna if we assume the moon is 3×105 m away? 
(d)  	 Assuming  this  viewed  spot  is  smaller  than  the  earth,  and  that  the  earth  looks  like  a 
blackbody  at  250K,  approximately  how much  larger  should  your  lunar  antenna  now 
become to allow for the additional noise radiated by the earth itself?  Discuss briefly.
