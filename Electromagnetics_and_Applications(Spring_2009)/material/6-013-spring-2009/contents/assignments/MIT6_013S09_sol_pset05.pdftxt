Problem  5.1

(i) For a quarter wave plate we know  that  the diﬀerence  in phase gained  from propagating  through  the plate 
between  the  component  polarized  along  the  fast  axis  and  the  component  polarized  along  the  slow  axis  is 
π/2.  We  know  that  for  a  wave  with  free  space  wavelength  λ  ,  the  phase  gained  by  propagating  through  a

(ii)  If  we  limit  ourselves  to  using  the  plate  as  a  quarter  wave  plate,  than  we  can  express  the  output  of 
the  system  as  a  function  of  the  input  light  and  the  orientation  of  the  QWP.  For  this  we  will  assume  the 
transmission  axis  of  the  ﬁrst  polaroid  is  along  ˆx  and  the  transmission  axis  of  the  second  polaroid  is  along 
yˆ.  Let  the  unit  vector  in  the  direction  of  the  fast  axis  of  the  waveplate  be  ˆif  and  in  the  direction  of  the 
slow  axis  be  ˆis .  Since  these  vectors  are  orthogonal,  it  is  possible  to  decompose  the  electric  ﬁeld  into  one 
component  along ˆif  and  one  along ˆis .

◦
At  the  output  of  the  plate,  the  component  of  the  electric  ﬁeld  along  the  fast  axis  will  have  gained  phase 
φf ast  and  the  component  along  the  slow  axis  will  have  gained  phase  φslow .  Thus  at  the  output  we  have 
E ¯  = ˆif cos(Θ)E  cos(ω t − kz + φ ◦  − φf ast ) + ˆis sin(Θ)E  cos(ω t − kz + φ ◦  − φslow )
◦
◦ 
Since  the  ablsolute  phase  of  the  components  at  the  input  doesn’t  matter,  we  can  set  φ  = φslow  to  simplify 
◦ 
the  result  (remember  that  φf ast−slow  = π/2). 
E ¯  = ˆif cos(Θ)E  cos(ω t − kz − π/2) + ˆis sin(Θ)E  cos(ω t − kz )

E ¯  = ˆif cos(Θ)E  sin(ωt − kz ) + ˆis sin(Θ)E  cos(ω t − kz )

Notice  that  this  is  an  elliptically polarized wave with  semi-ma jor  and  semi-minor  axis ˆif  and ˆif .  Which  axis 
is ma jor/minor  depends  on  the  input  angle  Θ. 
To  get  the  ouput  of  the  second  polaroid  we  take  the  dot  product  of  the  input  and  ˆy  (the  direction  of  the

Ignoring  the  time  variation,  this  will  be  a  maximum  when  Θ  =  45◦  (the  output  of  the  plate  is  circular

input  of  the  wave  plate,  for  a  total  transmission  of  0.25  times  the  intensity  at  the  input  of  the  system 
(assuming  unpolarized  light  at  the  system  input). 
Fmax  = 0.25 
(iii)  When  the  waveplate  is  rotated  to  give  maximum  transmission  through  the  system,  the  fast  (or  slow) 
axis  of  the  wave  plate  is  oriented  at  Θ =  45◦  from  the  transmission  axis  of  either  polaroid  sheet,  as  shown 
above. 

(iv)  If  we  apply  enough  voltage  to  make  the  plate  behave  as  a  half  wave  plate,  we  can  rotate  a  linearly 
polarized  input  by  90◦  (provided  the  plate  is  oriented  correctly).  So,  ignoring  the  reﬂections  at  the  surfaces 
of  the  plate,  the  total  transmission  for  unpolarized  light  is  0.5  (Iout  = 0.5Iin ). 
(b)  To  express  the  output  as  a  function  of  the  voltage,  we  need  to  derive  an  expression  for  the  electric 
ﬁeld  at  the  output  of  the  plate  as  a  function  of  voltage,  and  then  take  the  pro jection  of  that  ﬁeld  onto  the 
transmission  axis  of  the  second  polarizer.  For  this  solution  we’ll  assume  that  the  fast  axis  of  the  plate  is 
along  ˆx,  the  slow  axis  is  along  ˆy ,  that  the  ﬁrst  polarizer  is  oriented  to  transmit  light  polarized  along  √
, 
xˆ+ ˆy

and  the  second  polarizer  is  set  up  to  transmit  light  polarized  along  −xˆ+ ˆy .√
2 
If we  set  the phase at  input of  the plate  to  zero,  then  the E ﬁeld phasor at  the  input  is E ¯ =  √◦ 
( ˆx + ˆy).  After 
E

propagating  through  the  plate  this  becomes

which  gives  us  an  electric  ﬁeld  of

(a)  From  the  course  notes  we  know  that  the  skin  depth  in  a  material  will  be  the  inverse  of  the  imaginary

In  the  low  frequency  limit  we  know  that  the  frequency  ω  should  be  lower  than  the  plasma  frequency  ωp ,  so 
k  will  be  purely  imaginary  for  real  µ  and  ε.

There’s  no  way  to  solve  the  problem  using  the  ﬁrst  expression  (since  in  this  limit  the  skin  depth  is  constant

It  looks  like  the  assumption  wasn’t  too  bad,  so  we  can  use  this  answer  for  this  class.  Solving  for  the  exact

Exact  Solution  for  skin  depth  NOT  REQUIRED  FOR  CREDIT 

In  conductors  we  know  that  the  relation  between  k  and  ω ,µ,  and  ε  is  governed  by  the  following  set  of 
equations 
k �2  − k ��2  = ω2µε,  and  2k �k ��  = ωµσ 
where  k �  is  the  real  part  of  k ,  and  k ��  is  the  imaginary  part  of  k .  We  can  use  these  two  equation  to  get  a 
relation  between  the  imaginary  part  of  k  and  the  frequency  of  the  wave  ω .

For the case when sigma  is very small,  than the two ﬁelds are eﬀectivly  in phase.  We can break the magnetic 
ﬁeld  from  the  above  expression  into  two  terms.  The  real part  of  the phaser will be  in  phase with  the  electric 
ﬁeld (in both time and space) while the imaginary part will represent a ﬁeld 90◦  out of phase with the electric 
ﬁeld.  The  out  of  phase  component  in  this  example  will  have  a  magnitude  of  2 × 10−3  times  the  in  phase 
component,  so  we’ll  ignore  it  and  say  the magnetic  and  electric  ﬁelds  are  in  phase.

In  this  case  the  waves  are  not  in  phase  in  either  space  or  time.  From  the  expression  for  the  phasors  we 
can  see  that  the  electric  ﬁeld  will  have  a  spacial  dependance  of  sin(kz ),  while  the magnetic  ﬁeld  will  have  a 
spacial  dependance  of  cos(kz ).  The  electric  ﬁeld  is  also  90◦  out  of  phase  in  time with  the magnetic  ﬁeld  due 
to  the  presence  of  a  +j  term  in  the  electric  ﬁeld  phasor  which  is  not  in  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  phasor.

on  the  surface  of  a  perfect  conductor,  so  equations  2.1.14  and  2.6.17  don’t  help  us.  Equation  2.6.16  tells  us 
that  the  component  of  the  electric  ﬁeld  parallel  to  the  boundry  must  be  equal  to  zero,  so  Erx  = −Eix .  We

We want  to  sketch  the  electric ﬁeld  lines.  We do  this  in a  couple of  steps, ﬁrst  identiﬁng  lines where  the ﬁeld 
is  completly  along  ˆx  or  ˆz ,  then  sketching  the  components  along  the  line,  and  ﬁnally  connecting  the  sketched 
lines. 

E (x, y , z , t) = xˆ

Step  1

From the above expression for the real electric ﬁeld we know that the ﬁeld will be only along  ˆz when z = n √λ
,

2 
and  the  ﬁeld  will  be  completly  along  ˆx  when  z = (2n − 1)  λ  .

Step  2


Along  these  lines  we  sketch  the  electric  ﬁeld  vectors  (just  pick  a  few  interesting  points).  See  sketch.

Step  3


Now  we  connect  the  arrows  drawn  in  step  2  to  see  the  electric  ﬁeld  lines.  See  sketch  below.
