4.1  Problem  1 

GIVEN: 

A circular-cross-section pill magnet of diameter D produces a nearly uniform 
magnetic  ﬁeld,  B0 ,  across  its  broad  face.  We  wish  to  estimate  B0  using  two 
diﬀerent methods:  induced  voltage  and  force measurement. 

4.1.1  Part  a 
FIND: 

If the magnet drops through a tube, passing through with N-turn coil during 
the  descent,  how  can  you  use  the  resulting  voltage  signal  generated  over  the 
coil  to  estimate  the magnet’s  ﬁeld  strength, B0?

where  Λ  is  the  total  ﬂux  enclosed  by  the  chosen  path  integral  for  E .  The 
path  integral  takes  us  around  and  around  the  coil  N  times  (once  for  each 
turn;  assuming  that  the  coil  is  tightly  wound  such  that  all  of  the  turns  are 
approximately  in  the  same  place,  this  allows  us  to  pull  a  factor  of  N  out  of 
the  right-hand  side  of  Eq.  4.2.  In  this  case,  we  deﬁne  an  induced  voltage 
(historically  called  the  electromotive  force,  or  Vemf ,  even  though  it’s  not  a

The  concept  of  this  question  is  dicussed  in  Appendix  A.1.1.  The  math 
is  straightforward:  let  Λ(t)  be  all  the  ﬂux  which  has  passed  through  the 
coil  from  time,  t  →  −∞,  to  time,  t.  When  t  =  0,  the  magnet  is  exactly

the north pole  of  the magnet,  and ΦS  = −P hiS  the ﬂux  emanating  from  the 
south  pole  (negative  because  the  ﬂux  actually  enters  the  south  pole).  Then

the  total  ﬂux  leaving  the  north  pole  is  ΦN  = B0A,  where  A = πD2/4  is  the

4.1.2  Part  b 
FIND: 

What  happens  when  the magnet  is  dropped  down  a  copper  tube?  Why? 

WORK: 

When  you  performed  this  experiment,  you  should  have  observed  that  the 
magnet  falls  very  slowly  through  the  copper  tube;  in  fact,  it  rapidly  reaches 
a  terminal velocity  and  then descends much more  slowly  than  it did  through 
the  plastic  tube.  This  seems  puzzling  at  ﬁrst  because  the  tube  is  copper, 
copper  is  not  a  ferromagnetic  material  (in  fact,  it  is  slightly  diamagnetic, 
which  means  that  it  is  slightly  repelled  in  the  presence  of  a  magnetic  ﬁeld, 
and  this  would  tend  to  lower  friction).  What’s  happening? 
The  copper  tube  is  kind  of  like  a  stretched-out  version  of  the  inductance 
coil  in  Problem  4.1a.  Each  diﬀerential  ring  of  the  copper  has  ﬂux  passing 
through  it,  and  because  the  ﬁeld  is  non-uniform  along  the  axis  of  symmetry, 
there is a time rate of change of the magnetic ﬁeld enclosed by this diﬀerential 
loops  by  merit  of  the  motion  of  the  magnet.  As  such,  an  EMF  is  generated 
over  these  diﬀerential  rings,  setting  up  an  azimuthal  eddy  current.  There  is 
a  magnetic  ﬁeld  associated  with  this  current,  and  Lenz’s  Law  (which  may 

6 

be  thought  of  as  the  sign  of Faraday’s  Law)  tells  us  that  this  current  acts  to 
oppose  the  change  in  ﬂux;  as  such,  the  eddy  currents,  too,  are  diamagnetic 
and  tend  to  repel  the magnet.  This  slows  the motion  of  the magnet. 
The  picture  is  a  little  more  complicated,  however.  After  the  magnet 
has  reached  its  terminal  velocity,  it  must  be  that  the  force  from  the  eddy 
currents exactly balances the force from the gravitational ﬁeld.  So the kinetic 
energy  of  the  magnet  is  no  longer  changing,  and  nor  is  the  energy  stored  in 
the  magnetic  ﬁeld.  But  the  potential  energy  must  be  changing  because  the 
magnet  is  still  falling  through  the gravity ﬁeld.  If  the pill  is not accelerating, 
where’s  the  energy  going?  At  this point,  the usual  6.013  approximation  that 
copper  is  a  perfect  conductor  fails  us;  if  it  were,  then  the  energy  could  not 
be  dissipated  anywhere.  As  such,  it  must  be  that  the  losses  in  the  copper 
tube walls are important.  In fact, the steady state is reached when the power 
dissipated  in  the  copper  tube  walls  exactly  balances  the  time  rate  of  change 
of  potential  energy,  which  is  mgv ,  where  m  is  the  mass  of  the  magnet,  g  is 
the  acceleration  due  to  gravity,  and  v  is  the magnet’s  terminal  velocity.  The 
terminal  velocity  is  slowest  when  the  resistive  “load”  in  the  copper  wall  is 
“matched”  to  the  inductive  source  in  the  form  of  the  falling  magnet.  And 
there  is  no  terminal  velocity  due  to  magnetic  eﬀects  in  the  limits  of  zero 
or  inﬁnite  conductivity  (though  the  case  of  inﬁnite  conductivity  may  make 
getting  the magnet  into  the  tube  tricky). 

4.1.3  Part  c 
FIND: 

Using the breakaway force from pulling the magnet away from a high-µ plate, 
again  estimate  the  ﬁeld  strength,  B0 ,  of  the  magnet  in  the  uniform-ﬁeld 
approximation. 

WORK: 

Approximating  the  magnet’s  ﬁeld  as  uniform  simpliﬁes  this  problem  con-
siderably.  In  this  case,  we  can  quickly  estimate  the  gap  energy  density  as 
Wm  =  B0
2/2µ0 ,  and  the  force  as  F  =  WmA  =  AB0
2/2µ0 .  This  means  that 
the  ﬁeld  strength  of  the  magnet  is  B0  =  � 2µ
0F  .  In  your  experiment,  the 
A 
scale’s  readout  of  mass  assumes  (correctly)  a  downward  force  from  gravity; 
you  determine  how  much  of  the  gravitational  load  the  magnetic  attraction 

7 

can  support.  Therefore,  it  is  appropriate  to  determine  the  breakaway  force 
from  ∆mg ,  where  ∆m  is  the  mass  diﬀerential  you  read  oﬀ  from  the  digital. 
This  gives  for  the magnet’s  ﬁeld  strength

where  again,  A = πD2/4  is  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the magnet. 
The  uniform  ﬁeld  approximation  is  good  when  the  magnet  is  close  to

straightened  out  such  that  the  extend  along  normal  lines  from  the magnetic 
surface  to  the  ferromanetic  plate’s  surface.

4.2  Problem  2 

GIVEN: 

Linear  reluctance  motor  energized  by  N-turn  coil;  stator  and  linear  shaft 
have  permeability,  µ  �  µ0 .  At  t  =  0,  overlap  of  shaft  and  stator  is  area, 
A = 9 × 104  [m2 ].  Depth  of  system  is  3cm. 
4.2.1  Part  a 
FIND: 

Maximum  magnetic  energy  density  [J/m3 ]  at  t  =  0,  as  well  as  location  of 
maximum  energy  density. 

WORK: 

The maximum  energy  density  is  located  in  the  gap.  You  can  satisfy  yourself 
of  this  by  considering  the  ﬁeld  distribution.  The  high-µ  of  the  stator  core 
conﬁnes  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines  largely  to  the  interior  of  the  core  (this  is 
the  lowest-energy conﬁguration).  To complete their (magnetic) circuit,  these 
ﬁeld  lines  must  eventually  exit  the  stator,  since  they  cannot  take  a  closed-
circuit  path.  They will  do  this  primarily where  their  path  through  the  air  is 
a  minimum  - this  is  in  the  air  gap  between  the  linear  shaft  and  the  stator. 
Since total ﬂux is conserved, the simplest approximation is to neglect fringing 
ﬁelds  and  assume  that  all  of  the  ﬂux  passes  through  the  smallest  air  gaps. 
H  in  the  gap  is  found most  simply  from Amp´ere’s  law  in  the  approxima-
tion  that  since  Bin  stator  � Bgap  (depending  on  on  the  cross-section-to-gap 
area  ratio),  but  B  =  µH  and  µin  �  µ0  such  that  H  is  negligible  in  the 
Amp`erian  countour  everywhere  except  in  the  narrow  air  gap.  Then

Force,  fz ,  acting  to  pull  the  pole  faces  together. 

WORK: 

Appendix A.2.2 includes a discussion explaining how to think about the force 
calculations  shown  here  (including  how  to  get  the  right  sign).  And  to  make 
sense  of  where  the  ﬂux,  λ  comes  in,  see  A.2.1.  In  the  meantime,  deﬁne 
R = 2g/(µ0A) and  let λ be  the  total ﬂux  enclosed by  the  coil;  then  it  can be 
shown  that 

1
f� = −∇wm  = −∇(
λ2R),

so that when the ﬂux, λ, is held constant (since the system is being controlled 
by  a  voltage  source  rather  than  current),

Remember  that  R = 2g/(µ0A),  where  the  2g  extends  in  the  z-direction. 
By  symmetry,  if  the  stator  is  squeezed  or  expanded  an  amount,  dz ,  the  gap 
lengths  change  by  dg  = dz/2,  so that d/dz  →  1
2 d/dg .  Finally,  dR/dz  =

And there  it  is:  the  force  is the magnetic stress times the normal area, which 
we knew all along.  To evaluate, we know that B  in the gaps is 2 T; therefore, 
fz  = −(2[T])2/(4π × 10−7 [H/m])9 × 10−4 [m2 ] = −1.432 × 103 [N]  , where the 
negative  sign  indicates  that  the  force  acts  to  oppose  an  increase  in  the  gap 
(i.e.  it  pulls  the  pole  faces  toward  one  another). 
In terms of natural problem parameters, the force might also be expressed

Don’t  worry  - the  negative  sign  is  just  what  we  wanted!  Since  we  did  this 
carefully, we assumed a diﬀerential motion  in the  ˆz -direction which  is  implic-
itly  in  the  positive  zˆ-direction.  The  sign  on  the  force  then  naturally  points 
to  oppose  this  diﬀerential  motion,  just  as  we  expected.  The  force  results  in 
a  stress  on  both  the  cantilevered  stator  and  the  shaft;  mechanical  engineers 
need  to  know  these  stresses  in  order  to  properly  design  the  components  of 
electric machines  like  this  one.

�  = 2g  is  the  total  gap  length.  This  is  just  what  we  expected.  Note  that 
the  lateral  force  on  the  shaft  points  in  the  direction  to  increase  the  overlap 
area  - the  shaft  is  pulled  into  the  stator  (or  equivalently,  the  stator  is  pulled 
toward  the  shaft). 

4.2.4  Part  d 
FIND: 

Output  voltage  induced  over  the  N -turn  coil  if  the  shaft  is  withdrawn  at  a

WORK: 
The  magnetic  circuit  gives  the  simple  Ohmic-styled  relation,  N I  =  λR,  so 
that λ = N I /R = N I µ0A/�.  Faraday’s law then asserts that the induced emf 
voltage  is  the  time  rate  of  change  of  the  total  enclosed  ﬂux,  Vemf  = −dλ/dt; 
the  sign  of  the  circuit  voltage  depends  on  the  sense  in  which  the  leads  are 
attached.  Given that the problem statement allows for a varying voltage over 
the  leads,  let  us  assume  that  now,  the  current-turn  product  is  clamped  by  a 
current  source,  so  that N I  is  a  constant.  Then

The  voltage  is  positive  because  withdrawing  the  rod  tends  to  reduce  the 
ﬂux  passing  through  the  magnetic  circuit,  and  Lenz’s  law  tells  us  that  the 
induced current is set up in such a way as to oppose this change in ﬂux.  This 
means that the current will try to send more ﬂux through the magnetic circuit 
in  the  original  direction, which  requires  an  induced  voltage  that  strengthens 
the  original  current.

Leaky  capacitor,  everywhere  permittivity,  �,  but  having  a  nconductivity,  σa 
from  the  top  electrode  to  the  mid-plane,  and  σb  from  the  mid-plane  to  the 
bottom  electrode.  σa  = 10σb .  Total  dielectric  thickness  is  2d.  The  capacitor 
is  charged  to  1000  VDC . 

4.3.1  Part  a 
FIND: 

Total  capacitance  of  this  device. 

WORK: 

Neglecting  fringing  ﬁelds,  the  geometry  of  this  problem  lends  itself  to  the 
assumption  that  all  ﬁeld  quantities  are  uniform  in  the  xˆ- and  ˆy -directions 
(where the  ˆz -direction points from the bottom electrode to the top electrode. 
As  such,  the  equipotential  lines  should  be  planes  parellel  with  the  bottom 
and  top  electrodes.  By  continuity  of  the  potential,  it  must  be  that  there 
exists  a  an  equipotential  in  the  interfacial  plane  between  the  two  dielectrics; 
that  is,  everywhere  on  that  plane  is  of  uniform  potential.  This  allows  us  to 
break  up  this  inhomogeneous  problem  into  two  homogeneous  problems  that 
we  already  know  how  to  solve;  the  boundary  condition  at  the  interface  knits 
the  two  solutions  together.  In  particular,  we  can  treat  the  top  half  of  the 
system  as  a  leaky  capacitor,  and  the  bottom  half  as  another  leaky  capacitor 
(leaky  capacitor  refers  to  the  fact  that  the  structure  has  both  capacitive  and 
resistive  character  - it  “leaks”  charge  in  DC). 
So,  the  capacitance  of  the  top  half  is Ca  = �A/d,  and  that  of  the  bottom 
half  is  the  same,  Cb  =  �A/d  =  Ca .  The  resistance  of  the  top  half  is  Ra  = 
d/(σaA);  of  the  bottom  half,  Rb  =  d/(σbA)  =  10Ra .  An  equivalent  circuit 
can  be  drawn  as  in  Figure  4.1. 
In  the high-frequency  limit,  the resistances do not contribute signiﬁcantly 
to the total impedance of the structure, so the circuit is reduced to two series 
capacitances.  These  combine  like  resistors  in  parallel:  Ctotal  =  C1C2/(C1  + 
C2 ),  so

which  is  just  the  capacitance  of  the  structure  excluding  the  inhomo-
geneity.  This  makes  sense  because  in  the  high-frequency  limit,  the  eﬀective 
impedance  for  the  displacement  current  vanishes,  so  that  the  displacement 
current  (the  second  half  of  Amp`ere’s  law)  shorts  out  the  ohmic  current  (the 
ﬁrst  part).  In  this  case,  conductivity  is  no  longer  important,  and  the  inho-
mogeneity  in  the  dielectric  eﬀectively  disappears.

The simplest way to solve this problem is to use the circuit diagram in Figure 
4.1.  Vm  is  the  node  voltage  in  between  the  two  parallel  RC  pairs.  Since  the 
capacitor  is maintained at a DC voltage,  it  is now appropriate  to  look at  the 
circuit  in  the  low-frequency  limit,  where  the  capacitos  are  open  circuits.  In 
this  case,  the  resistors  comprise  a  voltage  divider,  so  that  Vm  =  V Rb/(Ra  + 
Rb ).  With  Rb  = 10Ra  (see  Part  a),  Vm  = 10V /11 = 1000[V]/1.1 ≈ 909[V]  .

Perhaps  the  ﬁeld  approach  provides  the  simplest  method  for  ﬁnding  the 
charge  on  the  interfacial  layer.  The  program  will  be  as  follows: 

1.	 ﬁnd  the  ﬁelds  in  each  homogeneous  region

where  the  negative  sign  for  the  volumetric  polarization  density,  ρp ,  indicates 
that  the  polarization  ﬁeld  lines  extend  from  negative  to  positive  polariza-

boundary  condition  for D  normal  to  the  boundary  will  give 

Pn2  − Pn1  = −ρps ,

At  time  t = 0− ,  the  circuit  is  shorted,  but  the  charge  at  the  interface, m, 
is  unable  to  discharge.  At  time  t = 0,  the  circuit  is  then  opened.  Gauss’  law

presribes the ﬁelds in both regions, a and b: (Da+Db )A = Qm  ⇒ �(Ea+Eb ) = 
ρf m  = 2Vm0 �/d,  since  Ea  =  Eb  = (Vm  − Vtop )/d  = (Vm  − Vbottom )/d  and 
Vtop  =  Vbottom  at  time  t  =  0,  and  deﬁning  Vbottom  to  be  the  ground.  This 
means  that  the  initial  conditions  are:

V1 (t = 0) = 0 

(4.24) 

where V1 (t) is the voltage on the top electrode, Vm (t) is the voltage at the 
midplane  interface,  and  both  of  these  voltages  are  referenced  to  the  bottom 
electrode.  Next,  we  can  write  the  diﬀerential  equations  that  govern  these 
voltages:

iRa  = iCa  = (Vm  − V1 )/Ra  = −VCa /Ra  = Ca

(Vm  − V1 ) 
⇒ 
dt  = − RbCb

These  are  two  decoupled  diﬀerential  equations  which  may  be  solved  imme-
diately  as 

(Vm  − V1 ) = (Vm  − V1 )t=0e −t/τ1 Vm  = Vm (t = 0)e−t/τ2 
(4.25) 
where  τ1  ≡  RaCa  and  τ2  ≡  RbCb .  From  this  follows  (noting  that  (Vm  − 
V1 )t=0  = Vm (t = 0)  since  the  top  and  bottom  electrodes  are  initially  shorted 
and  the  bottom  electrode  is  always  the  reference) 

V1  = Vm (t) + Vm0e −t/τ1  = Vm0 (e−t/τ2  − e −t/τ1 ) 
(4.26) 
V1  is  the  required  voltage;  it  is  the  potential  diﬀerence  between  the  top  and 
bottom  electrodes  after  the  system  has  been  shorted  for  a moment  and  then 
opened.  Since  σa  =  10σb  but  all  other  parameters  of  the  two  homogeneous 
regions  are  identical,  Rb  =  10Ra  and  τ2  =  10τ1 .  This  means  that  while  the 
two  exponentials  initially  balance  to  zero,  the  negative  term  in  the  equation 
decays  rapidly,  leaving  behind  a  positive  excess  that  decays  more  slowly  as 
approximately  τ2  = �/σb  .  The peak voltage  is  found by  locating  the critical 
point for this equation where the derivative with respect to time is zero.  This 
is  t∗ =  ln(τ2/τ1 )τ1τ2/(τ2  − τ1 ).  Substituting  into  Equation  4.26  gives  for  the 
peak  voltage

4.4  Problem  4 

GIVEN: 

Transistor  controlled  by  free  charge  density,  ρf ,  within  a  zone  of  width,  W , 
where  � = 4�0  and  σ = 1  [S/m]. 

FIND: 

If  the  voltages  on  the  transistor  electrodes  bounding  that  zone  abruptly 
change,  forcing  ρf  to  take  values  characterizing  the  next  transistor  state, 
with  what  time  constant,  τ ,  is  the  new  ρf  distribution  established?  Can 
τ  be  signiﬁcantly  less  than  W/c,  where  c  is  the  speed  of  light  within  the 
semiconductor?  Discuss  brieﬂy. 

WORK: 

Assuming  a  medium  is  linear,  homogeneous,  and  isotropic,  and  also  has 
ohmic  and  dielectric  character,  the  time  constant  for  charge  decay  is  τ  = 
�/σ .  This  follows  immediately  from  taking  the  divergence  of  Amp`ere’s  law, 
substituting  from  Gauss’  law  for  electric  ﬁelds,  and  solving  the  ordinary 
diﬀerential  equation  for  the  free  charge  density,  ρf . 
Let’s  examine  the  quantity  numerically  with  the  given  parameters:  τ  = 
�/σ  = 4�0/σ  ≈  3.54 × 10−10  [s].  For  comparison,  the  propagation  time  for 
information  to  be  transferred  between  the  electrodes  is  W/c.  Dimensions 
of  integrated  circuits  are  already  in  the  tens  of  nanometers.  Conservatively 
assuming  W  �  100  [nm],  and  noting  that  when  �  = 4�0 ,  c  =  c0/2  in  a 
nonmagnetic  material,this  leads  to  W/c  �  10−7/(3 × 108/2)  =  2 × 10−15/3 
[s].  In  this  example,  the  light  propagation  time  is  much  smaller  than  the 
exponential  decay  rate  of  the  charge  density;  however,  conductivity  varies 
over many  orders  of magnitude,  and  so  this  need  not  always  be  the  case. 
The question of whether the exponential decay time can exceed the prop-
agation  time  of  information  through  the  structure  is  subtle.  However,  the 
basic  idea  is  that  the  speed  of  light  is  the  limiting  speed  of  information  and 
mass  transfer.  The case of changing ρ would seem like mass  transfer  because 
we know  that  the charges are attached  to masses which are certainly moving 
inside  the  structure.  However,  the  actual  quantity  is  density.  Consider  a 
discretized  grid  in  2D.  Imagine  four  particles  are  located  in  a  square  in  this 
grid,  and  that  these  four  particles  each  move  along  separate  diagonals  into 

20 

the  corner  boxes  of  a  9 × 9  subgrid.  In  the  region  occupied  by  particles,  the 
density  is  transitioned  from  4  particles/grid  to  4/9  particles  per  grid,  while 
the  particles  have  only  moved  a  distance  of  √2  box  lengths.  This  example 
serves  to  show  that  the  density  can  vary  rapidly  even  if  the  particles  vary 
slowly. 
However,  it  is  true  that  ohm’s  law  is  limited  in  that  it  describes  the 
steady-state,  average motion  of  particles  that  is  set  up  after many  collisions. 
First  of  all,  this  average  velocity  must  always  be  smaller  than  that  of  light, 
and second, the transport cannot be considered “ohmic” until many collisions 
have  occurred  (i.e.  until  after  many  collision  times,  τc ).  Before  this  time, 
the  charged  particles  behave  more  like  free  charged  particles  accelerating 
continuously  under  an  electric  ﬁeld.  So,  we  can  say  with  a  fair  degree  of 
certainty  that a  charged particle  cannot hope  to  travel  from one  electrode  to 
another  in  a  time  shorter  than  W/c  (and  if  it  did,  physicists  would  be  very 
excited  and  would  have  something  to  do). 
A simpler problem to consider that might  illustrate this point  is that of a 
regular  parallel  plate  capacitor.  Assume  a  charge  carrier  density  of  n  charge 
carriers  per  unit  volume,  and  that  each  charge  carrier  has  charge,  q .  Also, 
imagine  that  the  capacitor  has  area,  A,  thickness,  d,  dielectric  constant  �, 
and conductivity, σ  (i.e.  it is a “leaky” capacitor).  If the capacitor is charged 
up  initially to V0  and then open-circuited,  it will discharge  itself according to 
V  =  V0e−t/τ ,  where  τ  =  �/σ .  This  implies  a  current,  i  =  V /R  =  V σA/d  = 
V0e−t/τ /R.  The  current  density  is  J  =  i/A,  and  the  corresponding  velocity 
of  charge  carriers,  v ,  must  then  be  J  =  nqv  ⇒  v  =  J/(nq) =  i/(nqA) = 
V0e−t/τ /(RnqA) = V0e−t/τ σ/(dnq). 
We  run  into  trouble  when  v > c,  the  speed  of  light.  In  this  case,  we  had 
better  check  our  assumptions  - the  two  consitutive  relations,  D  =  �E  and 
J  =  σE .  It  is  the  second  of  these  - the  point  form  of  Ohm’s  law  - that  is 
failing  - it  predicts  that  the  charge  carriers  can  go  faster  than  they  actually 
can. 
Again, let’s pick some typical numbers.  For a voltage of 1 V, σ = 1 [S/m], 
d=100  [nm],  n = 1016  [m−3 ],  and  q = 1.6 × 10−19  [C],  the maximum  velocity 
predicted  using  Ohm’s  law  is  6.25 × 109  [m/s],  over  an  order  of  magnitude 
faster  than  the  speed  of  light.  It  would  seem  we  had  better  be  careful  be-
fore  assuming  that  ohmic  transport  is  the dominant  transport mechanism  in 
semiconductors  for  these  time  and  space  scales.

There  are  several  ways  to  approach  this  problem.  The  direct  method  from

where  ˆs is the unit vector pointing in the direction of the wave’s propagation. 
The  extra  factor  of  c  appears  because  we  compute  the  average  momentum 
contained by the wave and then examine the momentum ﬂux (i.e.  how much 
of  that momentum  is  crossing  a  reference plane per unit  area per unit  time). 
In this case, the surface is black, so all the momentum ﬂux striking it is ab-
sorbed.  The pressure  is  p = F /A = dq/dt/A = �E 2/2.  It  is  given  that  �S � = 
1 [kW/m2 ]; hence  p = �S �/c ≈ 103 [W/m 2 ]/3 × 108 [m/s] ≈ 3.333 × 10−6  [N/m2 ] . 
Another  approach  is  to  consider  the  equivalent  ﬂux  of  photons.  The 
photon  energy  is  hf ,  and  to  achieve  a  power  ﬂux  of  1  [kW/m2 ],  there  must 
be  �S �  =  hf nc ⇒  n  =  �S �/(hf c)  photons  per  unit  volume  traveling  at  the 
speed  of  light.  The  momentum  of  each  photon  is  q  =  h/λ;  as  such,  the 
momentum  ﬂux  (which  is  also  the  pressure)  is 
p =  h nc =  h  �S � c =  �S �  =  �S �  ≈ 3.333 × 10−6 [N/m2 ],  as  before.

C y + D,  and  Z (z ) =  E z + F .  Now,  multiply  all  together  to  get  the  most 
general  solution  for  these  separation  constants:

where  the  constants,  Ci ,  i  from  1  to  8,  are  chosen  to  satisfy  the  boundary 
conditions. 

4.6.2  Part  b 
FIND: 

If  the  potential  is  Φ  =  0  on  three  intersecting  edges  of  a  cube,  and  10  [V] 
at  the  opposite  corner,  what  is  the  value  of  Φ  at  the  intermediate  corners? 
(Note:  Laplace’s  equation  is  ubiquitous;  we  could  as  well  be  solving  for  the 
temperature  at  these  corners,  for  example.) 

WORK: 

The  general  solution  in  Equation  4.34  may  be  applied  to  satisfy  the  given 
boundary  conditions.  Place  the  coordinate  system  along  the  vertex  where 
the  three  zeroed  edges  intersect.  Along  any  axis,  at  least  two  coordinates 
are  zero,  this means  that  the  ﬁrst  four  constants  in  the  general  solution  can 
be  non-zero,  but  all  the  rest  must  be  zero.  But  symmetry  also  restricts 
the  solution.  For  the  expanded  form,  you  can  readily  convince  yourselfthat 
C2  =  C3  =  C4  =  C .  For  the  factored  form,  in  order  to  require  that  C5 ,  C6 , 
and  C7  are  zero,  we  need  that  DF  =  BF  =  BD  =  0.  But  symmetry  in 
this  case  requires  that  the  problem  is  invariant  if  the  axes  are  permuted;  as 
such,  A  =  C  =  E  and  B  =  D  =  F .  In  other  words,  symmetry  means  that 
Equation  4.34  can  be  written  as 

Φ(x, y , z ) = (Ax + B )(Ay + B )(Az + B ) 

(4.35) 

Then  it  follows  that  B  =  D  =  F  =  0.  Immediately,  we  recognize  that 
the  only  term  that  survives  is  the  xyz  term.  If  the  cube  has  length,  �,  then 
10  =  C1 �3  ⇒  C1  =  10/�3  ([V]  in  this  application).  Along  the  intermediate 
corners,  either  x  or  y  or  z  is  zero;  therefore,  the  xyz  term  vanishes,  leaving 
Φ(intermediate  corners) = 0  .

Appendix  A 

Appendix  for  HW4 

A.1  Problem  1 

A.1.1  Part  a:  Concept 
The  important  conceptual  point  of  this  question  is  that  the  induced  voltage 
signal  records  all  of  the  ﬂux  which  passes  through  it  (scaled  by  a  factor  of 
N ).  Since  the magnet  passes  through  the  coil  from  north  to  south  pole,  and 
the ﬁeld lines all emanate from the north pole and enter at the south pole, al l 
of  the  ﬂux  passing  out  of  the  north  pole  of  the magnet will  pass  through  the 
coil,  and  afterward,  al l  of  ﬂux  entering  the  south  pole  will  pass  through  the 
coil.  But Faraday’s law in Eq.  4.3 tells us that the incremental change in ﬂux 
passing  through  the  coil  per  unit  time  is  exactly  the  induced  voltage  (with  a 
factor  of N ).  This means  that  the  voltage  keeps  track  of how much new ﬂux 
is  passing  through  the  coil  at  any  given  instant.  If  we  add  up  (integrate)  all 
of  these  incremental  changes  for  the  entire  descent,  we’ll  get  zero,  because 
about  half  of  the  time,  the  ﬂux  passes  through  the  coil  in  one  direction,  and 
the other half of  the  time,  it passes  through  in  the other direction.  But  if we 
just  integrate  the  incremental  ﬂux  changes  up  until  the  time  the  magnet  is 
halfway  through  the  coil,  we  must  have  found  how  much  ﬂux  is  leaving  the 
northern  face  of  the magnet. 
This  is  an  incredible  result,  because  it  allows  us  to  have  a  very  funda-
mental  characterization  of  the  magnet  without  knowing  very  much  about 
the  exact  nature  of  the  ﬁelds  or  about  the  magnet’s  motion.  And  we  can 
even  use  this  ﬂux  to  extract  a B0  for  out  simple model  of  the  ﬁelds  from  the 
magnet,  even  though  this  model  could  not  have  produced  the  voltage  trace 

25 

in  the manner  prescribed  in  the  problem  statement. 

A.2  Problem  2 

A.2.1  Part  a:  Magnetic  Circuits 
Let’s  calculate  the  magnetic  ﬂux,  λ,  in  the  system.  We  know  H  in  the  gap, 
and  so  we  can  ﬁnd  B  here.  In  the  uniform  ﬁeld  approximation,  λgap  = 
A ,  where  �  = 2g  is  the  total  path  length  through 
BgapA  =  µ0HgapA  =  N I µ0
�
the  air  gaps.  By  conservation  of  ﬂux,  and  in  the  approximation  that  all  the 
ﬂux  crosses  through  air  only  at  the  narrowest  gaps,  we  know  that  λgap  = 
λstator = λshaf t  - that  is,  all  the  ﬂux  exiting  the N I  coil  completes  a  circuit 
through  the  stator  and  shaft.  This  should  turn  on  a  light  in  your memory. 
Let’s  examine  this  relation  a  little  more  closely:  how  about  putting  N I 
on  one  side,  so  that  we  have 

(A.1) 

N I  =

λ. 
µ0A 
This  relation  should  set  oﬀ  another  light.  The  ﬁrst  term  looks  suspiciously 
like  the  resistance  in  a  straight  block  of  ohmic  material,  where  the  conduc-
tivity,  σ ,  is  replaced  by  the  permeability,  µ0 .  And  the  rest  of  the  relation 
looks  like Ohm’s  law  with  the  subsitution, N I  ↔ V  and  λ ↔ I .  In  fact,  the 
analogy between electrostatic circuits and magnetostatic  circuits is complete. 
A ,  as  the  magnetic  reluctance,  analogous  to

electrical  resistance.  The  current-turn  product,  NI,  is  sometimes  referred  to 
as  the  magnetostatic  force,  or  MMF,  even  though  (again)  it’s  not  a  force  at 
all. 
In  general,  we  can  break  up  the  Amp`erian  contour  integral  into  the  sum 
of  H  · �  products  in  each  homogeneous  sub-medium,  and  then  impose  con-
servation  of  ﬂux,  so  that

ﬂux  entering  a  “node”  also  exits  the  node  (conservation  of magnetic  ﬂux).

Why  is  this  useful?  Because  it’s  now  relatively  simple  to  calculate  the 
ﬂux, λ,  the  inductance, L = λ/i or mutual  inductances  for more complicated

systems,  and  other  useful  quantities.  For  example,  L = λ/i = N �

And  now  the  term,  “reluctance  motor”,  ﬁnally  means  something.  The 
idea  is  to  get  a  force  based  on  the  tendancy  for  the  system  to  adjust  so

Also,  more  complex  systems  are  now  readily  handled  by  applying  the 
normal parallel and series combination rules  for reluctances that are used  for 
resistances.  So  we  now  have  a  crank-turn  procedure  for  arbitrary  magneto-
static  conﬁgurations  provided  we  can  always  neglect  fringing  ﬁelds.

A  diﬀerential  amount  of  mechanical  work,  dw ,  is  deﬁned  through  f  dx.
· 
By  convention,  we  say  that  work  is  done  by  the  force  ﬁeld  on  an  ob ject 
when  dw  >  0  (i.e.  when  the  diﬀerential  movement  is  in  the  direction  of  the 
force),  and  that  external  work  is  done  on  the  ﬁeld  when  dw  <  0  (i.e.  when 
the  motion  opposes  the  force’s  direction).  In  the  latter  case,  the  energy 
is  stored  as  potential  in  the  ﬁeld.  The  potential  energy  is  deﬁned  for  the

where  the  negative  sign  appears  such  that  the  potential  energy  is  a  positive 
quantity  when  the  path  direction  opposes  that  of  the  force.  Going  in  the 
other  direction  leads  to  a  speciﬁcation  of  the  force  if  the  potential  is  known, 
f� = −∇U  .  This  always  works  when  the  system  is  curl-free  (i.e.  ∇× → 0), 
which,  in  integral  form,  says  that  any  line  integral  which  starts  and  ends 
in  the  same  place  is  zero.  This  makes  the  potential  a  scalar,  conservative 
ﬁeld.  Whenever you do energy calculations and reach a conceptual standstill, 
you  can  always  return  to  these  deﬁnitions,  especially  in  the  application  of  a 
gravitational  potential  (to  which  you  have  grown  accustomed  since  birth). 
A  confusing  point  to  the  energy  calculations  that  we  do  in  6.013  is  that 
we  intutively  know  that  the  force  acts  to  bring  the  pole  faces  together  and 
minimize  reluctance,  but  our  calculations  seem  to  show  that  this  tends  to

make  the  ﬁelds,  and  therefore  the  stored  energy,  stronger  (i.e.  we  seem  to 
be  maximizing  energy  instead  of  minimizing  it).  The  confusion  is  exactly 
analogous  to  the  situation  of  P  =  V 2/R  =  I 2R  (remembering  that  total 
magnetic energy place a similar role  in magnetostatic calcuations that power 
does  in  quasielectrostatic  calculations).  When  voltage  is  prescribed,  P  is 
minimized  for  maximum  R;  when  current  is  prescribed,  it  is  minimized  for 
minimum R.  The  same  is  true of magnetostatic  circuits,  substituting wm  for 
P , N I  for V , R  for R,  and λ  for  I .  Confusingly, where we normally  think  of 
V  as  speciﬁed  in  a quasielectrostatic  circuit,  it  is λ  that  is  typically  speciﬁed 
in  a  magnetostatic  circuit1 .  And  R  is  minimized  when  the  gap  length  is 
minimized,  so  the  pole  faces  tend  to  pull  together. 
As  usual,  signiﬁcant  words  and  ideas  can  be  hidden  in  a  few  deceptively 
simple  formulations. 

1 Ironically,  this  is  so  because  the  voltage  is  speciﬁed  in  the  driving  electrical  circuit.
