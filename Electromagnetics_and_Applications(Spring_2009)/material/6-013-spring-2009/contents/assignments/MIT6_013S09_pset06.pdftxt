Problem 6.1 

Stripline  can be  approximated  as  an  ideal parallel-plate TEM  line  if  its width W  is much 
greater  than  the separation d between  top and bottom plates  (i.e.,  if  fringing  fields can be 
neglected).    Consider  the  illustrated  infinitely  long  stripline  for  which  d  =  1 micron  and 
the medium between the plates has μ = μo and ε = 4εo.

(a)	 For  what  width  W  is  the  impedance  of  this  line  50Ω?  Is  the  ideal  parallel  plate 
model valid for these dimensions?  Discuss briefly. 
(b)  For  a  1-volt  DC  signal,  what  is  the  intensity  I  (time-average  Poynting  vector 
magnitude [W]) of the TEM electromagnetic field propagating between the plates? 
(c)	 Evaluate  the  time  average  electric  and magnetic  energy  densities  per meter,  i.e., We 
and Wm [J/m], on this line for case (b) (neglect fringing fields). 
(d) 	 Show that the average power on the line, cline(We + Wm), equals the I found in (b). 
(e)  Show that if two arbitrary signals flowing in opposite directions are superimposed so 
that v(z,t) = f+(t - z/v) + f-(t + z/v), then the total power flowing down this line in the 
+z  direction  at  any  (t,z)  equals  the  power  flowing  in  the  +z  direction  minus  the 
power  flowing  in  the  -z  direction.    Show  whether  or  not  such  superposition  of 
powers also applies when the two signals flow in the same direction on TEM lines. 

Problem 6.2 
A 30-centimeter-long, air-filled 100Ω TEM line is excited at one end by a matched 
voltage source V(t), where V(t) is a step function 2u(t) volts.  Sketch and quantitatively

Problem 6.3 
A  line  driver  at  one  end  of  a  2-cm  long  200-ohm  TEM  transmission  line  triggers  a  flip-
flop at  the other end with a step function, as  illustrated.   The dielectric  in  the  line has ε = 
4εo and μ = μo.

(a) 	 Sketch and dimension v(t,z) on the line at t = 0.1 ns (10-10 sec). 
(b)  Repeat (a) for t = 0.2 ns. 
(c)  Sketch  quantitatively  the  load  voltage  vL(t)  until  the  flip-flop  is  triggered;  its  trigger 
voltage is 4 volts.  Note that triggering is excessively delayed. 
(d)  What is the asymptotic value of the load voltage vL(t) as t→∞? 
(e) 	 If the line impedance were matched at 50 ohms, would there still be excessive delay? 
(f) 	 Write a simple equation for v(z,t) valid for 0 < t < 0.1 ns, then extend it to 0.2 ns. 

Problem 6.4 
A  unit-step  current  source  Io(t)  =  u(t)  directly  drives  the 
illustrated  circuit.    Sketch  and  dimension  the  voltage  v(z)

illustrated. 
(a)  At t = 0 the switch at z = D/2 opens for D/10c seconds and then recloses.   	Sketch the 
voltage v(z) on the line at t = D/5c. 
(b) 	  Will  vL(t)  across  the  transistor  load  ever  exceed  its  breakdown  limit  of  7ZoIo  volts?
