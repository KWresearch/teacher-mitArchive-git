6.1  Problem  6.1 

GIVEN 

Inﬁnitely-long  stripline  for  which  d = 1  µm  and  the medium  between  the  plates  has  µ = µ0 
and  � = 4�0 . 

6.1.1  FIND 

Width, W ,  for which  the  characteristic  impedance  of  the  line  is  50 Ω.  Discuss whether  ideal 
parallel  plate model  is  valid  for  these  dimensions. 

WORK 

For  an  ideal  parallel  plate  transmission  line,  Z0  =  ηd/W ,  where  η  is  the  characteristic 
impedance  of  the  medium  (for  EM  waves).  As  before,  η  =  �µ/�  =  �µ0/(4�0 ) =  η0/2 = 
188.5 [Ω].  Then  the  inverse  problem  is  solved  as  W  = dη/Z0  = 1 × 188.5/50 = 3.77 [µm]  . 
Since W/d = 3.77,  it  is  acceptable  to  approximate  the  line  as  an  ideal  parallel  plate  conﬁg-
uration  to  ﬁrst  order,  but  we  should  not  expect  very  accurate  results. 

6.1.2  FIND 

For  a  1 V DC  step  signal, what  is  the  intensity,  I ,  (time  average Poynting  vector magnitude 
[W])  of  the  TEM  ﬁeld  propagating  between  the  plates? 

WORK 

For  the  parallel  plate  waveguide,  the  electric  ﬁeld  runs  from  top  to  bottom  plate  and  has 
magnitude,  E  =  V /d  =  106  [V/m].  Then  the  time-average  Poynting  vector  is  found  from 
�S � =  |E 2/(η)| = 1012/188.5 = 5.305 × 109  W/m2 .  There  is  no  factor  of  because  the  signal 
is  a  step  and  not  a  sinusoid.  Multiplying  by  the  cross-sectional  area 

I  = �S �A = �S �W d = �S �d2W/d = �S �d2η/Z0 
=  |E 2/(η)|d2η/Z0  = (E d)2/(Z0 ) = v 2 /(Z0 ) = 1/50 = 0.02 [W] 
+
Even  though  we  derived  this  for  the  parallel  plate  geometry,  it  is  general  for  TEM  lines 
(and  will  work  for  sinusoids  after  including  the  factor  of  ). 
Let’s check the magnetic ﬁeld.  It can be found by drawing an Amp`erian loop, C  encircling 
a  single  strip  of  the  line,  and  noting  that  the  ﬁeld  is much  stronger  between  the  plates  than 
 
C  H� d�l  =  Ienc  ≈  HW  = ⇒  H  =  I /W .  For  a  single  pulse,  v+  and  i+  are 
outside.  Then  �
· 
related by v+  = Z0 i+ , so i+  = v+/Z0  = 1/50 = 0.02 [A], and H  = I /W  = 0.02/3.77 × 10−6  ∼= 
5.305 × 103  [A/m].  But  �S� � = E� × H� =  zˆ5.305 × 109  W/m2 ,  which  is  exactly  what  we  got 
before.

2.  whether  or  not  this  superposition  holds  for  two  waves  traveling  in  the  same  direction. 

WORK 

It  is  generally  a  good  idea  to  apply  superposition  at  the  level  of  ﬁelds.  In  the  transmission 
line  problem,  we  get  away  with  working  in  terms  of  voltage  and  current  signals  with  the 
convention  that  i+  =  Z0v+ ,  but  i−  =  Z0v− .  We  have  seen  that  I+  =  v+/Z0  =  v+ i+ .  The 
2
same would be  true  if  the subscript were permuted  to −.  If there are  two  signals on  the  line, 
we may  apply  superposition  at  the  level  of  the  voltage  and  current  in  the  following  way: 

2
2
I+,net  = (v+  + v− )(i+  − i− ) = (v+  + v− )(v+  − v− )/Z0  = (v+  − v− )/Z0  = I+  − I−  , 
which  is what we  set  out  to  demonstrate.  However,  for  two  signals  propagating  in  the  same 
direction  (and  at  the  same  phase  velocity), 

(6.5) 

I+,net  = (v+,1  + v+,2 )(i+,1  + i+,2 ) = (v+,1  + v+,2 )(v+,1  + v+,2 )/Z0 
2
2
= (v+,1  + v+,2  + 2v+,1v+,2 )/Z0  = I+,1  + I+,2  + 2v+,1v+,2/Z0 

. 

(6.6) 

The  cross-coupling  term  destroys  the  superposition  of  powers. 
Superposition  is  one  of  the  deﬁning  features  of  linear  ﬁeld  and  wave  phenomena.  It  can 
be  a  subtle  topic  at  times  and  a  source  of  confusion,  as  this problem  demonstrates.  But  you 
can  see  your  way  through  by  applying  some  physical  reasoning  and  a  few  simple  rules.

6.2  Problem  6.2 

GIVEN 

TEM  line,  �  =  30  [cm],  air-ﬁlled,  Z0  =  100 [Ω],  excited  at  one  end  by  a  matched  voltage 
source,  V (t),  where  V (t)  is  a  step  function  2u(t)  volts. 

6.2.1  FIND 
Sketch  and  quantitatively  dimension  V (z )  and  I (z )  on  the  line  at  t1  = 15 × 10−10  [s]  for  the 
case  where  the  load  is  a  300  [Ω]  resistor. 

WORK 
Make  the  transformation,  z �  = z − �,  so  that  at  the  load,  z �  = 0. 
If  the  line  is  ﬁlled  with  air,  then  c  =  c0 ,  and  the  propagation  time  across  the  line  is 
τ  = �/c = 0.3/3 × 108  = 10−9  [s].  This means  that  t = 15 × 10−10  [s] = 3�/(2c).  This means 
the  line  voltage  is 

� 
v(z � , t = t1 ) = v+ (1 + ΓLu((t − τ  − z �/c))) = v+ (1 + ΓLu( + z � )). 
2 
At t = 0, the source sees a voltage divider across the terminals of the line, so v+  = Vs/2 = 
1  [V].  ΓL  is  the  reﬂection  coeﬃcient  at  the  load,  ΓL  = (ZL/Z0  − 1)/(ZL/Z0  + 1) =  1/2.  As 
such,  in  terms  of  z ,

�

v(z , t = t1 ) = v+ (1 + ΓLu((t − τ  − z �/c))) = 1 +  u(z −  )  .

Since the source is matched, there will be no further reﬂections.  As expected, the forward 
and  reﬂected  steps  sum  to  the  steady-state  voltage  of  3/2  [V].

WORK 

The  approach  to  take  here  is  to  replace  the  line  to  the  left  of  the  load  with  its  Th´evenin 
equivalent  circuit.  This  has  a  source  of  vth  = 2v+u0 (t − �/c)  and  a  source  impedance  of 
Z0  = 100  Ω.  The  circuit  equations  lead  to

This is a ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equation, and we write the solution by inspection,

(6.12) 

vc  − vth  = V0e −t/(Z0C )u(t − �/c) ⇒ vc  = 2v+ (1 − e −t/(Z0C ) )u(t − �/c), 
where we were able to factor out vth  = 2v+  because of the initial condition that the capacitor 
is  a  short. 
The  next  step  is  to  determine  how  this  load  voltage  translates  into  waves  on  the  line. 
The  load  voltage  is  the  sum  of  the  forward  and  backward  waves,  vc  =  v+  + v−  = 2v+ (1 − 
e−t/(Z0C ) )u(t − �/c).  Let  t�  ≡ t − �/c  and  solve  this  relation  for  v− : 
v− (z �  = 0, t) = v+ (1 − 2e −t� /(Z0C ) )u(t� ) 
Lastly,  we must make  this  wave  travel  in  the −zˆ-direction:

Repeat for the case when the load is a diode triggering at 1 V (i.e.  an ideal diode back-biased 
by  a  1  V  battery). 

WORK 

This  problem  is  amenable  to  either  the  “bounce”  approach  we  used  in  part  (a)  or  the 
Th´evenin  equivalent  circuit  used  in  part  (b).  We  could  also work  backwards.  In  the  steady-
state,  the  voltage  on  the  line  will  be  unity  if  the  diode  is  shorted,  while  the  current  will  be 
(2-1)  V/100  Ω  =  0.01  A  (since  there  is  no  voltage  diﬀerential  on  the  line).  And  we  cannot 
have reﬂections at the source.  As such, we can be sure that the diode will reach  its threshold 
on  the ﬁrst bounce,  and  indeed,  it does:  because  v+  = 1 V,  the diode will  appear  as  a  short. 
Now,  since  we  short  voltage  sources,  ΓL  =  −1,  and  v−  =  −v+ .  So  how  do  we  arrive  at 
the  steady  state  solution?  The answer  is  that another wave will be  launched when  the diode 
becomes  a  short,  again  of  height,  1  V.  This  precisely  cancels  out  the  eﬀect  of  the  reﬂected 
wave,  so  that  the  system  actually  reaches  steady-state  in minimum  time. 
At  t = 3�/(2c),  v(z , t1 ) = 1 [V]  and  i(z , t) = 0.01 [A]  .

GIVEN 

A line driver at one end of a 2 cm-long, Z0  = 200 Ω TEM transmission line triggers a ﬂip-ﬂop 
at  the  other  end  with  a  step  function,  as  illustrated.  The  dielectric  in  the  line  has  �  = 4�0 
and µ = µ0 .  The  input  to  the ﬂip-ﬂop can be  treated as a 50 Ω  load;  it  triggers  (changes  the

reﬂections,  vL,2  = vL,1  + v+,2  + v−,2 .  vL,1  and  all  other  signal  persist  because  the  source  is  a 
step.  You  can  think  of  the  problem  also  as  applying  to  inﬁntesimal  pulses  from  the  source; 
each  one  traverses  the  line,  is  reﬂected  at  the  load,  goes  back  to  the  source  and  is  reﬂected 
again,  and  so  forth.  The  source  puts  out  a  continuous  supply  of  these  inﬁnitesimal  pulses 
because  it  is  a  step. 
The  next  two  reﬂections  are  found  as  before.  Deﬁne  the  source  reﬂection  coeﬃcient 
analogously  with  that  at  the  load,  ΓS  = (Zs  −  Z0 )/(Zs  +  Z0 ).  For  this  problem,  since 
Zs  =  ZL , ΓS  = ΓL  =  −3/5.  Then  v+,2  = ΓS v−,1  = ΓS ΓLv+,1  = 9 × 8/25  =  2.88  [V],  while 
v−,2  = ΓLv+,2  = ΓLΓS ΓLv+,1  = −27 × 8/125 = −1.728  [V].  Then  vL,2  = v+,1  + v−,1  + v+,2  + 
v−,2  = 8 − 4.8 + 2.88 − 1.728 =  4.352  [V].  This  is  above  the  trigger  voltage,  so  the  ﬂip-ﬂop 
triggers  at  3τ  = 4 × 10−10  [s]. 
In  general,  the  nth -step  load  voltage  occurs  at  time  t = (2n − 1)τ ,  and  has  step  height,

We  already  determined  this  limit  in  the  last  section.  It  was  vL (t → ∞) = 5 [V]  .  This 
corresponds  to  a  voltage  divider  between  the  load  and  source  impedances.  It  underscores 
the  lessons  that  transmission  lines  are wires,  and  in  the  steady  state,  after  the  transient  has 
decayed,  they  may  be  treated  like  circuit  nodes,  just  as  we  have  always  treated  them  prior 
to  learning  about  transmission  lines  in  6.013.

If  the  line  impedance  is matched  at  50  Ω,  would  there  still  be  excessive  delay? 

WORK 

Matching  the  line  impedance  to  the  source  and  load  eliminates  reﬂections.  We  achieve  the 
steady-state  result  with  the  ﬁrst  traversal  of  the  line,  so  that  vL  =  0,  V,  t < τ ,  and  5V , 
t  ≥  τ .  Since  the  load  triggers  at  4  V,  the  system  achieves  the  minimum  possible  delay 
between  ﬁring  the  signal  at  the  source  and  getting  a  result  at  the  (ﬂip-ﬂop)  load. 
This  is  one  of  the  many  reasons  why  understanding  transients  on  transmission  lines  is 
important.  A ﬂip-ﬂop  is a bit  in digital memory,  the  source,  an attempt  to  change  that bit’s 
state.  Matching  impedances  increased  the  speed  of  this memory  circuit  by  a  factor  of  three.

6.4  Problem  4 

GIVEN 

Unit-step  current  source  drives  given  circuit  (transmission  line  of  length, D,  with  Z0  and  c, 
terminated  in  two  more  transmission  lines  in  parallel,  each  of  inﬁnite  length  and  same  Z0 , 
c).

Sketch  and  dimension  the  voltage  on  all  lines  at  time, 

1.  t = t1  = D/(2c), 

2.  t = t2  = 3D/(2c),  and 

3.  t = t3  = 5D/(2c). 

WORK 

For  this  problem,  it  is  more  convenient  to  begin  by  studying  the  current  problem.  In  the 
steady  state,  we  expect  1  A  to  ﬂow  down  the  main  line,  and  A  to  ﬂow  down  each  of  the 
parallel  branches. 
At  z  =  D,  there  will  be  a  reﬂection  because  of  an  impedance  mismatch.  The  look-in 
impedance  for  the parallel branches  is  simply  the parallel combination of  their characteristic 
impedances,  ZD  = Z0 ||Z0  = Z0/2.  The  voltage  reﬂection  coeﬃcient  is  then

ZD ,n  − 1

ΓD  =

The  voltage  reﬂection  coeﬃcient  at  the  source  is  trickier.  But  remember  that  when  we 
superimpose  the  contribution  from  diﬀerent  sources  (including  incoming  signals),  we  short 
all other voltage sources and open  all other current sources.  Then the reﬂected signal sees the 
current  source  as  an  open  circuit,  which means  that  the  source  voltage  reﬂection  coeﬃcient 
is  Γs  = 1. 
Now, the ﬁrst current signal edge, i+,1 , will have height, 1 A, since the source is a unit step. 
The  reﬂection  will  be  i1  =  −ΓD i+,1 ,  where  the  negative  sign  appears  because  i+  =  v+/Z0 
but  i−  = −v−/Z0 ,  and  v−  = ΓD v+ .  After  t  = 2D/c,  there  will  be  another  reﬂection  at  the 
current  source,  with  i+,2  = −Γs i−,1  = ΓsΓD i+,1 . 
Putting  these  pieces  together  gives  the  following  line  current  for  0  ≤  t <  (6D/(2c) = 
3D/c):

The  formula  derived  in  the  last  section  for  the  load  voltage  may  be  used  again  after 
replacing  ΓL  with  ΓD ;  then  the  voltage  at  z  =  D  as  t  → ∞  is  vD (t  → ∞) =  Z0 i+,1 (1 +

Again,  it  is  useful  to  interpret  this  steady-state  result  in  terms  of  the  current.  In  the 
steady  state,  we  expect  the  current  on  each  branch  to  be  half  of  the  current  coming  out  of 
the  source,  A.  A  steady-state  voltage  at  D,  and  everywhere  else  on  the  primary  line  from 
0 ≤ z < D,  of  v+,1/2 = Z0 i+,1/2  produces  exactly  this  branch  current. 
This  is  only  the  voltage  on  the  primary  line,  0 ≤ z < D.  The  voltage  on  the  branches  is 
identical,  since  they  are  in  parallel.  Here,  at  time  t = D/c,  an  identical  voltage  step  will  be 
launched  down  each  of  these  lines  of  magnitude,  vL  =  v+,1 (1 + ΓD ),  so  that  the  voltage  on 
these  branches  for  0 ≤ t < 3D/c  is 
vbranches(z � , 0 ≤ t < 3D/c) = Z0 i+,1u(t − D/c − z �/c) 
,  where  z �  = 0  at  z = D,  and  z �  measures  the  length  along  either  of  the  branches. 
Evaluating  at  the  three  snapshots  gives: 
 

0 ≤ t = t1  = D/(2c) 
0
 

0 ≤ t = t2  = 3D/(2c)  . 
vbranches (z � , t) =  Z0 i+,1u(3D/(2c) − D/c − z �/c) = Z0 i+,1u(D/2 − z � )
 
0 ≤ t = t3  = 5D/(2c) 
Z0 i+,1u(5D/(2c) − D/c − z �/c) = Z0 i+,1u(3D/2 − z � )

6.5  Problem  5 

GIVEN 

A  current  source  delivering  I0  drives  a  delicate  transistor  that  has  an  input  impedance  of 
4Z0  through  a  TEM  line  of  impedance,  Z0 .  The  system  has  reached  a  steady  state. 

6.5.1  FIND 

At  t = 0,  the  switch  at  z = D/2  opens  for  a  time  interval, D/10c,  and  then  recloses.  Sketch 
the  voltage,  v(z ),  on  the  line  at  t = D/(5c). 

WORK 

The  initial  current  distribution  on  the  line  is  i(z , t  <  0)  =  I0 .  This  requires  the  voltage 
distribution  to  be  V0  ≡ v(z , t < 0) = I0ZL  = 4I0Z0 . 
An intuitive way to think about this problem is that the switch sends a wave proclaiming 
that  it  has  changed  from  a  short  to  an  open  circuit  it  (“darn  it”).  At  time,  D/(10c),  the 
switch  sounds  a  counter-wave  saying  that  it  is  now,  again,  a  short  (“darn  it”).  In  the 
language  of  matching  boundary  conditions,  this  information  is  embodied  by  the  statement 
that  the  current  through  an  open  circuit  is  zero.  Since  the  current  on  the  line  is  initially 
I0 ,  the  switch  sends  a  pulse,  i−  = −I0  travelling  to  the  left  of  the  open  circuit,  and  another 
pulse,  i+  =  −I0 ,  traveling  to  the  right.  Each  pulse  lasts  for  a  time,  D/(10c),  so  that  its 
length  is D/10.  Behind  the  pulse,  the  distributions  return  to  their  steady-state  values. 
Then,  with  the  transformations,  v+  =  Z0 i+  and  v−  = −Z0 i− ,  we  have  v+  = −Z0I0  and 
v−  = −(−Z0I0 ) = Z0I0 .  This means that the total voltage on the left-moving pulse is vlef t  = 
V0 + v−  = 5Z0I0 , while the total voltage on the right-moving pulse is vright  = V0 + v+  = 3Z0I0 . 
As  such,  we  can  write  the  total  voltage  everywhere  on  the  line  at  time,  t = D/(5c),  as 

v(z , t = D/(5c)) = V0  + v−  [u(z − 3D/10) − u(z − 4D/10)] + v+  [u(z − 6D/10) − u(z − 7D/10)] . 
(6.29) 
Figure  6.7  illustrates  this  voltage  distribution. 

6.5.2  FIND 

Will  vL (t)  ever  exceed  the  transistor’s  breakdown  limit  of  7Z0I0?  Explain. 

WORK 
At  the  load,  the  voltage  reﬂection  coeﬃcient  is  ΓL  = (ZL,n  − 1)/(ZL,n  + 1)  =  3/5.  At  the 
source,  remembering  that  for  superposition  problems,  we  short  voltage  sources  and  open 
current  sources, we know  that  the current  source appears as an open circuit,  so  that ΓS  = 1.

The  load  voltage  will  be  smal lest  after  the  rightward-moving  pulse,  v+ ,  hits  the  load  for 
the  ﬁrst  time,  since  this  pulse  is  beneath  the  initial  voltage  and  ΓL  = 3/5  >  0.  It  will  be 
largest  after  the  leftward-moving  pulse,  v−  reaches  the  load.  This  will  happen  after  it  has 
reﬂected  oﬀ  of  the  source,  where  it  suﬀers  no  loss  because  ΓS  =  1,  and  then  traverses  the 
entire  length of the  line before reﬂecting at the  load.  All subsequent bounces  for either pulse 
will  have  smaller  pulses,  as  the  pulse  heights/depths  will  diminish  by  a  factor  of  ΓL  = 3/5 
with each round trip.  As such, we need only concern ourselves with a maximum load voltage 
of  vL,max  = V0  + v− (1 + ΓL ) = Z0I0  (4 + 1 × (1 + 3/5)) = 5.6Z0I0  < 7Z0I0  .  This is beneath 
the  breakdown  voltage  of  the  transistor.  Note  that  the  period  for  which  the  load  voltage 
reaches  this  height  is D/(10c),  the  duration  of  the  pulse. 
The minimum load voltage is  vL,min  = V0  + v+ (1 + ΓL ) = Z0I0  (4 − 1 × (1 + 3/5)) = 2.4Z0I0  , 
which  also  is  (presumably)  safe  for  the  transistor.  Again,  this  minimum  voltage  lasts  for  a 
duration  of D/(10c).
