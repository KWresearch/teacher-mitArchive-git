Problem 5.1 

-6
A  certain  pair  of  Polaroid  sheets  transmits  light  with  minimum  transmission  (10 ) 
when  their  attenuating  axes  are  at  right  angles,  and  with  an  ideal  0.5  transmission  when 
these  axes  are  aligned.  We  wish  to  design  a  light  intensity  modulator  by  electrically 
controlling  the  permittivity  εfast  along  the  fast  axis  of  a  perfectly  transparent  plate  of 
-5
thickness d inserted between these two polaroids, where εfast  = εslow + 10 V , εslow  = 2εo is 
the  permittivity  of  the  orthogonal  slow  axis,  and  V  is  the  control  voltage  applied  along 
the fast axis. 

(a)  In  terms  of  d  and  εo,  what  control  voltage  V  yields  a  quarter-wave  plate  (QWP) 
between  the polaroids,  and what  is  the maximum  fraction F of  the  incident  light  that  can 
then  pass  through  the  modulator  when  the  two  Polaroid  sheets  are  at  right  angles  (i.e. 
blocking  ~all  light  in  the  absence  of  the  QWP)?  By what  angle  θ  is  this  QWP  rotated 
relative to the polaroids when transmission through the three sheets is maximum?  Would 
a half-wave plate perform better and, if so, how?  Explain briefly. 

(b)  This optimum modulator can then vary the fraction, F, of transmitted power between 
-6 
10 and  the maximum  value  found  in  part  (a),  depending on V.  Find  the  expression  for 
F(V,d).

 (c)  If  the  transparent  dielectric  plate  has  ε  =  4εo,  what  fraction  Fr  of  the  incident  wave 
power  is reflected by the plate’s front surface at normal  incidence?  A nearly comparable 
amount is reflected by its back surface as well. 

(d)  What is Brewster’s angle θB for the plate of part (c)? 

Problem 5.2

 (a)  Consider  a  metal  with  roughly  one  free  electron  per  atom  and  assume  a  frequency 
-3
30 
such  that  it  behaves  like  a  plasma  with  µ  =  µo,  ε  =  εo,  and  ne  =  10
[m ].  What  is  the 
skin or penetration depth δ [m] of radio waves into this plasma in the low-frequency limit 
(ω → 0)?  Appendix A.4 of the Course Notes contains useful physical constants.

(b)  For  a  metal  with  conductivity  σ  =  107  [S/m],  at  what  frequency  f  [Hz]  is  the 
penetration “skin depth” δ the same as for (a)? 

Problem 5.3 

John  knows  that  the  electron  density  in  the  ionosphere  generally  increases  with 
altitude  sufficiently  slowly  that  upward  bound  radio  waves  suffer  very  little  reflection 
except  below  the  plasma  frequency  and  at  incidence  angles  beyond  the  critical  angle  θc. 
John can hear his  local 1-MHz  radio station WMIT out  to  the suburbs but  then  loses  it as 
he  drives  further,  until  suddenly  about  200  miles  away  he  can  again  hear  WMIT;  from 
this he concludes θc  = 45o. 

(a)  What is the ionospheric plasma frequency fp 

[Hz] on this occasion? 

(b

in

o 
e  incident  time-averaged 
)  For  those  waves  impacting  the  ionosphere  at  45 th
2
  vector,  S ,  just  inside  the 
,  is  1  mW/m .  What  is  the  complex  Pointing

tensity,  S (t ) 

ctly  at  the  critical  angle, 
io
nosphere  at  this  position  when  the  wave  is  incident  exa
  = θc  = 45°?

Problem 5.4 

(a)  An  x-polarized  1-GHz  uniform  plane  wave  of  one  watt  per  square  meter  is 
propagating  in  the  +z  direction  in  a  very  slightly  lossy medium  characterized  by  εo,  µo, 
and  σ =  10-4  [S/m].  What  are  the  complex  electric  and magnetic  fields  E(z ) and H (z ) in 
this case?  Are they in phase? 

(b)  The  same  wave  is  now  propagating  in  the  +z  direction  in  vacuum  and  is  reflected 
from a perfect conductor at z = 0.  What now are the complex electric and magnetic fields 
E(z ) and H (z ) for z < 0?  AreE andH in phase in time and space?  Explain briefly. 

(c)  What are the total  E(x , z ) and H (x , z )  for the case where a TM uniform plane wave 
of wavelength λ  is propagating in  the x-z plane for z < 0 and  is  reflected at 45o  incidence 
angle  from  a  perfect  conductor  at  z  =  0?  AssumeH(0,0)  =  Ho,  the  maximum  value 
ofH(x,z). 

(d)  Sketch the total electric fieldE(x,y,t) for z < 0 and t = 0 for the waves of part (c).
