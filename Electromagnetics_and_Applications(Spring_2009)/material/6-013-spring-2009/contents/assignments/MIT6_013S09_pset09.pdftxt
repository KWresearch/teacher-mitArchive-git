(a)  Boston’s  big  dig  created  new  traffic  tunnels,  some 
measuring  approximately  7  ×  12  meters  at  their 
conducting walls.  Over what frequency range [Hz] 
will  these waveguides  propagate  one  and  only  one 
mode?  What is the name of this mode? 
(b) 	 What  are  the  cutoff  frequencies  fm,n  [Hz]  for  the  TE11,  TE01,  and  TM11  modes  for 
these tunnel waveguides? 
(c)  What is the waveguide wavelength λg for the TE10 mode in these tunnels at 15 MHz? 
(d) 	 We  can  consider  the waves  at  15 MHz  to  be  plane waves  reflecting  from  the  tunnel 
sidewalls at some incidence angle θi; what is the value of θI for the TE10 mode? 
(e)	 Write  a  general  expression  for  the  magnetic  field⎯H(x,y,z)  for  the  TM11  mode  in 
terms of the waveguide dimensions b, a. 
(f)	 For  the TM11 mode, where might  long slots be cut  in  these waveguide walls without 
significantly  perturbing wave  propagation?   Briefly  explain  your  answer;  hint--your 
answer to (e) might help here. 
(g)  A  1-MHz  AM  broadcast  station  signal  is  below  the  cutoff  frequency  for  these 
tunnels  and  therefore  has  a  1/e  power  attenuation  distance  equal  to  δ.  What  is  the 
numerical  value  of  δ [m],  which  is  some  fraction  of  the  approximate  AM  signal 
penetration distance into the mouth of the tunnel? 
(h)  What  sorts of problems might be  experienced when  trying  to hear FM broadcasts  in 
the  88-108  MHz  band  inside  such  long  tunnels,  assuming  the  signals  penetrate  the 
opening?  Discuss briefly. 

Problem 9.2 

A  certain  perfectly  conducting  cavity  resonator  measures  3×4×5  cm,  or  b×a×d, 
respectively,  where  our  convention  is  d  ≥  a  ≥  b,  and  for  any  mode  TEmnp,  the  mode 
numbers m, n, and p are associated with the dimensions a, b, and d, respectively. 
(a)  What is the lowest resonant frequency fmnp of this air-filled cavity [Hz]?

(b) 	 What mode is this? 
(c)  Rank  order  the  resonant  frequencies  for  the  modes  TE011,  TM110,  and  TE101  from 
lowest to highest.  Explain briefly your method. 
(d) 	 What is the electric field distribution⎯E(x,y,z) for the TE101 mode? 
(e)	 What  is  the maximum  instantaneous  total  stored electric energy we max  for  this TE101 
mode in terms of the maximum instantaneous electric field Emax? 
(f)	 What  is  the  corresponding  average  power  dissipated  pd  [W]  by  this  TE101 mode  if  a 
dielectric the fills the entire cavity and is characterized by εo, μo, and conductivity σ? 
(g) 	 What  is  the  Q  of  this  lossy  TE101  resonance,  and  what  is  the  associated  cavity  1/e 
energy decay time, τ101 [sec]? 
(h) 	 How does τ101 compare to the charge and electric field relaxation time τ = ε/σ? 
(i)	 Roughly sketch the loci of those points on the cavity walls where to first order a tiny 
local  indentation  will  not  change  the  resonant  frequency  f101.  Indicate  (e.g.,  cross ­
hatch)  roughly  those  portions  of  the  cavity  walls  where  indentation  will  slightly 
reduce the resonant frequency.  Explain briefly. 

Problem 9.3 

As  the  owner  of  a  new HDTV  broadcasting  station  at  60 MHz,  a  decision must  be made 
concerning  transmitter power.   Assume  the data  rate  transmitted  is 18 Mbps  (18×106 bits 
per  second),  the  transmitting  antenna  has  equal  gain  of  ~10dB  toward  anyone  in  its 
customer  base,  an  extra  transmitter  power margin  of  20  dB  is  desired  to  compensate  for 
fading  due  to  multipath,  and  that  all  customers  are  located  within  60  km,  have  a  TV 
antenna with  10-dB  gain  that  points  toward  the  transmitter,  and  also  have  a  TV  receiver 
that needs at least 10-16 Joules per bit of information received. 
(a)	 What transmitter power PT [W] is needed? 
(b) 	 At  this  transmitter  power  what  is  the  transmitted  wave  intensity  I  [W/m2]  for 
customers 60 km away, assuming there is no fading? 
(c)	 What is the effective area Ae [m2] of the customer’s antenna? 

Problem 9.4 

A  certain  automobile  collision-avoidance  radar  transmits  60-GHz  CW  pulses  forward 
with  an  antenna  gain  G  of  10  dB  in  order  to  detect  pedestrians  and  automobiles  with 
scattering  cross-sections  σs  greater  than  10-2  m2.  The  receiver  requires  10-12  Watts  in 
order to detect such hazards at 50-m range using the same antenna.  What is the minimum 
feasible  transmitter  power  Pt  needed  for  this  radar?    If  the  antenna  radiation  resistance 
Rr  =  100  ohms,  what  voltage  |V|  must  the  transmitter  deliver  to  the  matched  lossless 
antenna?
