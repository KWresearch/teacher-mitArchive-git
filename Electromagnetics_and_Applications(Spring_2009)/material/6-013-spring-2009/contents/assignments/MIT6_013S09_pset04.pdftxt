Suggested  Reading:    Course  notes,  Sections  5.5.1,  6.1,  6.3,  5.3.1;  5.6,  4.3.1,  4.3.2;  1.3, 
4.5.1-4.5.4, 5.2, 4.4.1-4.4.2; 2.3.2-2.3.4 

Problem 4.1  (See associated lab instructions) 
A  pill  magnet  of  diameter  D  and  area  A  =  πD2/4  produces  a  nearly 
uniform  magnetic  field  Bo  across  its  broad  face.   We  wish  to  estimate  Bo 
using two different methods: induced voltage and force measurement. 
(a)  When  the magnet  is  dropped  down  a  tightly  fitting  but  slippery  non-
conducting  cylinder  it  induces  a  voltage  V(t)  across  a  compact  coil  of  N 
turns wrapped around  the cylinder, as  illustrated.   Based on  this  illustrated 
data,  what  is  the  approximate  value  of  Bo?    Briefly  explain  your  method 
and  indicate which  pole  is North  (top  or  bottom).   Hint: Before  drop,  coil 
flux linkage Λ = 0.  Between t = 0 and to: ΔΛ ≅ NBoA.  v(t) = dΛ/dt.

(b)  What happens when this magnet is dropped down a copper cylinder?  Why? 
(c)  To  measure  the  attraction  of  the  magnet  to  a  thin  high-permeability  steel  plate,  the 
magnet  is  taped  to  a  digital  scale  that  is  preloaded  with  a  large  weight.    The  steel  plate  is 
placed  on  top  of  the  magnet  and  then  pulled  away  manually  using  a  spring  so  that  the 
pulling  force can be varied  in a controlled manner while  the “break-away”  force Fo  [N]  for 
the  magnet  is  being  determined.    Given  Fo,  what  is  the  approximate  value  of  Bo?  Briefly 
explain your reasoning. 

Problem 4.2 
The  illustrated  horseshoe  electromagnet  z 
has  two  thin  gaps  g  =  10-4  m  separating  its
 
 
pole  faces  from  a  sliding  high-permeability
member, where B in the gaps is 2 Tesla and μ
 
>> μo.  The depth of the unit into the page is 
3  cm,  and  the  nominal  overlap  area  A  of  the  sliding  and  stationary  members  is  ~3  cm 
square (9×10-4 m2) at time t = 0.  This is a linear reluctance motor.

(b) 	  What is the force fz [N] acting to pull the magnet pole faces together in the z direction? 
(c) 	  What  is  the  lateral  force  fx  [N]  pulling  the  sliding  member  into  the  gap  (in  the  x 
direction)? 
(d)  	 What  output  voltage  Vo  is  induced  if  the  sliding  member  is  withdrawn  at  velocity  v 
[m/s]?  Again assume A = 3 cm square at the time of measurement.

Problem 4.3 
A  capacitor  charged  to  V  =  1000  volts  is  filled  with 
two  equally  thick  slabs  of  dielectric  having  permittivity  ε 
and area A, where the conductivity of the first is σa = 10 σb,  Vm 
as illustrated; the total dielectric thickness is 2d. 
(a) 	  What is the total capacitance C of this device? 
0 
(b) 	 What is the voltage Vm at the midpoint junction between the two dielectrics? 
(c) 	  What  are  the  free  ρfm  and  net  polarization  ρpm  surface  charge  densities  [C/m2]  at  this 
midpoint  junction?    The  net  polarization  surface  charge  ρpm  is  the  difference  between 
the polarization charges on the two dielectric surfaces at the junction. 
(d) 	  If  we  briefly  short  circuit  this  capacitor  so  that  V  =  0  and  ρfm  remains  roughly 
constant,  to what  approximate  peak  value Vp  does  the  open  circuit  voltage V  quickly 
return,  and  with  what  approximate  time  constant  τ  does  it  then  decay  to  zero?  Does 
this  suggest  that  inhomogeneous  high-voltage  capacitors  that  are  short-circuited  only 
briefly  to  discharge  them  could  nevertheless  be  dangerous?   Briefly  explain  your 
answer. 

Problem 4.4 
A certain transistor is controlled by its free charge density ρf within a zone of width W 
where  ε  =  4εo  and  σ  =  1  [S/m].    If  the  voltages  on  the  transistor  electrodes  bounding  that 
zone abruptly change, forcing ρf  to  take values characterizing  the next  transistor state, with 
what time constant τ is the new ρf distribution established?  Can τ be significantly less than 
W/c where c is the speed of light within the semiconductor?  Discuss briefly. 

Problem 4.5 
What average pressure p  [N/m2] does  a 1-kW/m2 1-GHz uniform plane wave  apply  to 
an absorbing black surface?  

Problem 4.6 
The  separation-of-variables  discussion  in  Section  4.5.2  in  the  notes  deals  with  two-
dimensional  potentials  Φ(x,y)  [volts].  Consider  the  three-dimensional  case  Φ(x,y,z)  and 
assume the boundary conditions yield k2 = 0. 
(a)  Derive the general form of Φ(x,y,z) that satisfies the Laplace equation in this case. 
(b)  If potential Φ = 0 everywhere along  three  intersecting edges 
0 volts 
of a cube (and therefore at four corners), and Φ = 10 volts at 
10 volts
the  opposite  corner,  what  is  the  single  value  of  Φ  at  the  
 
remaining three intermediate corners?  Explain briefly.
