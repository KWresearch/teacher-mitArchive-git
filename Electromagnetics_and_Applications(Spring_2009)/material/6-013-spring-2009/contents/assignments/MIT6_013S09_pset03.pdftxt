d

Two  parallel  metal  plates  separated  by  d 
overlap  a  distance  b  and  have width  L;  they 
are charged to a voltage V. 

b 
(a) 	 What is the force f⊥ [N] attracting the two plates in the y direction? 

(b) 	 What is the force f// [N] attracting the two plates in the x direction? 

(c)  Suppose we wish to design an electrostatic motor.   	To minimize losses associated with 
fringing  fields  the  plate  separation  d  should  be  less  than  ~  b/4  and  L/4.    To  prevent 
arcing, the electric field strength E should be less than the air breakdown field strength 
Ebd.  Assume  that  practical  considerations  limit  the maximum  velocity  of motor  parts 
to  about  100 m/s,  or  roughly  one-third  the  velocity  of  sound,  and  limit  the minimum 
plate  separation  to  ~0.5  mm.    Based  on  these  constraints,  what  is  roughly  the 
 
maximum  mechanical  power  Pmax  [Watts]  we  can  obtain  from  a  cleverly  designed 
electrostatic motor having  a volume of one  liter?    (Accuracy  to within a  factor of  two 
suffices.)    If  Ebd  =  106  V/m,  what  then  is  Pmax?  To  simplify  the  problem,  ignore  all 
switching  issues  and  consider  only  the  forces  associated  with  a  single  static 
configuration capable of continuous rotary motion. 

(d)  Please  sketch  the  general  geometry  you  assumed  for  your  maximum-power  motor  in 
(c) and briefly explain your design.   

(e)  To  help  gauge  the  plausibility  of  your  answer  to  (c),  evaluate  Pmax  for  the  case  Ebd  = 
106 [V/m].  

Problem 3.2 

The planet Jupiter places a magnetic field of approximately one 
Gauss  (10-4  Tesla)  at  its  electrically  conducting  moon  Io,  and 
this field (attached rigidly to Jupiter) rotates past Io at a relative 
velocity  of  ~7200  [m/s]  due  to  the  9hr  50  min  rotation  period 
of Jupiter.

(a)  What  is  the  maximum  voltage  V  (numerical  value)  induced  across  the  ~3340-km 
diameter of Io by this moving magnetic field? 

(b)  This  voltage  produces  a  current  I  that  flows  through  a  weak  plasma	  along  the 
magnetic  field  lines  down  to  Jupiter’s  ionosphere  and  back,  and  then  through  the  full 
diameter of  Io, with  a  total circuit  resistance of  about one ohm.   What  is  the  resulting 
magnetic  force  vector  f  [N]  on  Io?    Does  this  force  tend  to  accelerate  Io  or  slow  it 
down  in  its  orbit  about  Jupiter  (Io  moves  in  the  same  direction  Jupiter  is 
rotating)?⎯Explain briefly with  a  sketch  showing  the directions of  the  current  through 
Io and the force on Io. 

(c)  	 What mechanical power P  [W]  is being  applied  to  Io  (numerical value)?   This  can be 
compared  to  the  ~1  GW  electrical  power  typically  radiated  in  radio  and  television 
broadcast bands by these Io-generated currents. 

Problem 3.3 

A firm manufacturing devices  that accelerate electrons  to energies of 106 electron volts ( 1 
e.v.  equals  1.6  x  10-19  Joules)  suggests  that  its  accelerators  could  attack weapons  in  space 
at  great  distances.    If  the  terrestrial  magnetic  field  B  at  the  altitudes  of  interest  is 
approximately 10-5 Tesla, what  is  the maximum  range of  such a device  in vacuum when  it 
is  aimed  perpendicular  to  the  magnetic  field?      For  simplicity  ignore  the  relativistic 
increase in electron mass that occurs at 1Mev. 

Problem 3.4 

An  solid  iron  cylinder  of  permeability  μ,  length  D,  and  area  A  is  bent  in  a  circle,  as 
illustrated,  with  a  small  gap  d.    N  turns  of  wire  carrying  I  amperes  circle  the  cylinder  to 
yield a magnetic field of Bg within the gap; the gap stores nearly all the energy. 
Circumference D 

(a) 	 What is the inductance L of this device? 

(b)  What is the force f pulling the gap closed? 

(c)  What is L when there is no gap?

(e)  If the wire is superconducting and the situation is static, the inductor voltage V = 0.   	If 
now  we  mechanically  force  d  →  2d  in  τ  seconds  with  I  held  constant,  what  is  V(t) 
during this period?  One could make a sensor this way, perhaps a microphone.
