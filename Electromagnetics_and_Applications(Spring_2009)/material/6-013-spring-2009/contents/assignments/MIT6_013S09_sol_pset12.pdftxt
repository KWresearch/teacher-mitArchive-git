Solutions to Problem Set 12 

	θc = sin-1(k2/k1) = sin-1(c1/c2) = sin-1(ε2/ε1)0.5 = 80.9 degrees 
12.1  (a) 
2-ko
2)0.5 where kz/ko = sin 850.  It follows that α-1 = 0.60 λo 
(b) 	 αx = (kz
(c)  	 D  =  ~4λo.  Note  that  decay  is  rapid  relative  to D,  so we might  guess D  =  ~0.6(λx/2) 
where λx = λztanθi and λz = ~λo/2. 

12.2  (a)  	 3.  A43 is large, not A42 or A41.  Also, atoms can't leave 3 because A32 and A31  ≅ 0 
(b)  33.3 percent, since each atom absorbs E41 from the pump, but emits only E32. 

12.3  (a)  	 75 GHz.  fn = c/λn where nλn/2 = 2×10-3.  Δfn = c103/4 = 7.5×1010. 
(b) 	 4+.  Note, 0.1 percent of f = c/10-6 is 10-3×3×1014 = 3×1011 = 4×Δf.
4π×105.  Qc = ωoWT/Pd = (2πc/10-6)(2×10-3×4εoE2/8)/(10-2E2/2η) = f/Δf; η = ηo/2. 
(c) 

 

12.4	  (a)  A00 has cutoff f00 = 0 Hz.  f01 = f10 = cs/λ01 = cs/(2×5×10-3) = 34 kHz. 
f11 = 20.5×34 kHz. 
(b) 	 d = 0.02 = λ1/4= 0.75λ2.  f = cs/λ.  f001 = 340/0.08 = 4.25 kHz; f002 = 12.75 kHz. 
(c)  Only  the  foo  mode  propagates  at  audible  frequencies,  reducing  confusion.    The 
resonance  near  4  kHz  could  produce  problems,  except  that  most  speech  information 
lies  at  lower  frequencies,  and  most  people  have  poorer  hearing  above  ~12+  kHz. 
Music could be affected, however. 
(d)  	 Reinforcement occurs when nλn = 6 cm  (no p phase  reversal at walls), so  fn = cs/λn = 
n340/0.06  ≅  n×5.67  kHz.  Nulls  occur  if  0.06  =  (2n+1)λn/2,  or  f  ≅  2.8,  8.4,...  kHz. 
Forest  footfalls  yield white  noise,  and  the  frequency  at which  the  ear  perceives  nulls 
in such white noise indicates direction, even from behind--very helpful in the wild. 
(e)  Q  =  ωoWT/Pd.  ωo  =  2π×4.25  kHz.  WT  =  2Wp  =  (2p2/8γPo)area×length.  Pd  =  area  × 
(1 -  |Γ|2)p2/2ηs.  γ = 1.4, Po = 1.01×10-5.  ηs = 425.  Q = 0.80/(1  -  |Γ|2).  Thus Q = 1.6 
for |Γ|2 = 0.5, and for the next resonance Q = 4.8. 

12.5  (a)  Since <I(t)> = |p|2/2ηs ⇒ |p| = (2×425×100)0.5 = 206 N/m2. 
(b)  <I(t)> = ηs|u|2/2 ⇒ |u| = (2×100/425)0.5 = 0.69 m/s.
x = ∫u dt ⇒ D = 2|u|/ω = 2×0.69/(2π1000) = 0.22 mm. 
(c) 
θc = sin-1(csc/csw) = sin-1(0.99) = 81.9o. 
(d) 
(e) 
	At θc there is no decay, so α = 0. 

 

	ηo/ηd = ρoco/ρdcd  ≅ 103×330/(106×1050) = 3.14×10-4. 
12.6  (a) 
Γ = (Zn - 1)/(Zn + 1) where Zn = 3.14×10-4.  The door reflects |Γ|2  ≅ 0.9987. 
(b) 
(d)  	 When  5  cm  =  nλd/2,  there  is  perfect  transmission.    λd  =  (1050/330)λo,  so when  λd  = 
10 cm (for n = 1), then fpass = cs/λo = 330/(0.1×330/1050) = 10.5 kHz. 
(d)  	 Maximum mismatch when 5 cm = λd/4 and λd = 0.2; so fstop ≅ 10500/2 = 5.25 kHz.
