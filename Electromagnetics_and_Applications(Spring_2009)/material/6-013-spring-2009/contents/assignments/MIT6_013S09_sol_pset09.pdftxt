Problem  9.1 

(a) 

f11  = 

The waveguide will propagate only one mode in the frequency range between the two lowest cutoﬀ frequencies.

The  cutoﬀ  frequency  for  the  T E10  (which  is  the mode  with  the  lowest  cutoﬀ  frequency)  is: 
24  = 12.5 × 106  [H z ] 
f10  = 
c
Using  the  result  from  part  b  below,  we  can  say  that  between  12.5  MHz  and  21.4  MHz  only  one  mode  will 
propagate.  That  mode  is  the  T E10  mode.

The  tangent  of  the  incident  angle  is  equal  to  the  ratio  of  kz  to  ky .  At  15MHz,  only  one mode  is  propagating

From the expression in part e, we know that the magnetic ﬁelds are parallel to the sidewalls of the rectangular 
waveguide.  So  any  currents  generated must  be  along  ˆz .  In  that  case,  if  we  were  to  cut  thin  slots  along  ˆz  no 
currents  would  be  interrupted  and  the  waveguide mode  would  not  be  signiﬁcantly  perturbed. 

(g) 
To  ﬁnd  the  distance  δ  we  need  to  ﬁrst  ﬁnd  kz  for  the  wave. 
The AM signal will penetrate furthest for the lowest mode allowed by the waveguide.  From part (a) we know

that  this  is  the  T E10  mode,  with  ky  = π/12.

Signals  in  the  range  88-108 MHz  can  propagate  in  several  diﬀerent modes.  Each  of  these modes  propagates 
down  the  tunnel  at  a  diﬀerent  speed,  so  there  will  be  a  phase  shift  between  the  signal  from  the  diﬀerent 
modes.  This  will  result  in  interference  in  the  signal  due  to  the  phase  diﬀerence  between  diﬀerent modes.

Problem  9.2 

(a) 

By  checking  boundary  conditions,  we  see  that  the  lowest  order  resonance  will  require  two  of  (m,n,p)  to  be 
non-zero.  Knowing  the  relation  between  frequency  and  angular  frequency,  we  can  rewrite  equation  9.4.3  to

The mode associated with  the  lowest  frequency  is  the T E101  mode.  The T M101  mode  shares  the  same cutoﬀ 
frequency.

(c) 
T E101 ,  T E011 ,  T M110 
There  are  two  approaches  to  ranking  the modes  based  on  resonance  frequency.  First,  you  can  put  the mode 
numbers  into  the  frequency equation derived  in part  (a)  from equation 9.4.3.  Second, you can  recognize  that 
lower  resonance  frequency  is  associated  with  longer  dimensions.  So  the  lowest  frequency  should  have  1’s 
associated  with  the  two  longest  dimensions,  the  next  lowest  should  have  1’s  along  the  longest  and  shortest 
dimensions,  then  the  highest  will  have  1’s  along  the  two  shortest  dimensions.

The  cavity  1/e  energy  decay  time  is  the  same  as  the

  electric  ﬁeld  relaxation  time. 

(i) 

From  equation  9.4.13  in  the  course notes we  know  th
at  the  change  in  resonance due  to  a perturbation  of  the 
cavity  will  be  related  to  the  change  in  stored  electric  and magnetic  energy. 
ΔwT  =  Δf  = Δvolume We−Wm

f
wT 
This  equation  tells  us  that  if  we  decrease  the  volume  slightly  where  the  electric  ﬁeld  is  larger  than  the 
magnetic  ﬁeld  we  will  reduce  the  resonant  frequency.  If  we  decrease  the  volume  slightly  where  the  electric 
and magnetic  ﬁelds  are  the  same  then  the  resonant  frequency  will  remain  unchanged. 

So,  slightly  indenting  the  cavity  in  the  center  of  the  top  and  bottom  faces  (see  picture  below)  will  reduce 
the  resonant  frequency.  At  the  edges  of  the  top  and  bottom  face,  the  electric  ﬁeld  goes  to  zero.  So  at  some 
boundary between the center and edges the electric and magnetic ﬁelds will have the same value, and slightly 
indenting  the  cavity  at  this  boundary  will  not  change  the  resonant  frequency. 

The  actual  boundary  will  be  rounder  than  what  is  shown  in  the  picture.
