Problem 2.1 
Assume the “Whatever” vector⎯W(x,y,z) = 	 ˆ 
ˆ 
x sin y  + yy  
.

(a)  If an electric displacement vector⎯D =⎯W, what is the charge density ρ(x,y,z) [C/m3]? 

(b)	

If the magnetic field⎯H =⎯W, what is the current density⎯J(x,y,z) [A/m2], assuming⎯H 
is physically possible? 

(c)	 Does the magnetic field⎯B =⎯W satisfy all of Maxwell’s equations?  If not, which one 
is violated? 

Problem 2.2 

If the electric field E(t) = Re{E ejωt} where E is a phasor, then what is E(t) if: 

(a)  E = 1 - j 

(b)  E = ejπ/4 - 1 

(c) ⎯E = j xˆ  + (1 - j) yˆ

(d) 	 What is the complex vector⎯E if ⎯E(t) =  xˆ cos ωt +  yˆ sin(ωt + π/4)? 

 

 

[Hint: E(t) = cos ωt  for the case E = 1]

Problem 2.3 

(a)  What is the frequency f (Hz) of the wave having the magnetic field: 

⎯H =  xˆ sin(107πt - 0.2z) +  yˆ cos(107πt - 0.2z – 2.5π)? 

(b)  What is its wavelength λ (meters)? 

(c)	 What is the velocity of light c in this medium? 

(d)  Find the corresponding⎯E(x,y,z,t) assuming μ = μo. 

(e)	 What  is  the  polarization  of  this  wave?    (e.g.,  “left  circular”;  polarization  is  usually 
characterized by the behavior of the electric field vector) 

(f)  	 What is the shortest non-zero time delay τ(sec) that could be added to the x component 
of the wave in order to achieve linear polarization?  In this case, what is the direction θ 
of the linear polarization relative to the x axis?  A sketch may help. 

(g)  	 Polarization  can  also  be  characterized  by  complex  notation.   What  is  the  polarization 
of the z-propagating wave⎯E =  (j - 1)xˆ + (1 - j)y ˆ ?  (e.g., “left circular”.) 

Problem 2.4 
A  1-GHz  uniform  plane  wave  propagating  in  the  +z  direction  in  a  medium  μ,  ε  is 
characterized by⎯E =  x 3ˆ
.  

(a)	 What is the time average intensity [W/m2] of this wave? 

(b)  	 What  is  the  magnetic  energy  density  W
electric energy density We(t) there?

Using  the  general  expression  for  inductance  L,  find  L  for  a 
coaxial  inductor  of  length  D  and  short  circuited  at  one  end, 
where  the  inner  and  outer  radii  of  the  two  concentric 
conductors are ri and ro, respectively, as illustrated.
