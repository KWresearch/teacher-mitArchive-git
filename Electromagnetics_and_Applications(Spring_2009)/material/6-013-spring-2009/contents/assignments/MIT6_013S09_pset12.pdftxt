Problem 12.1 

A  certain  clad  optical  fiber  can  be  approximated  by  a 
dielectric  slab  waveguide  of 
thickness  D1  and 
permittivity  ε1  =  4  that  is  centered  in  a  dielectric  of 
thickness  D2  and  permittivity  ε2  =  3.9,  as  illustrated. 
Assume  the  angle  of  incidence  within  the  inner  fiber 
is θi = 85o, which is beyond the critical angle θc.

(a)  What is the critical angle θc? 

(b)  	 In  terms  of  the  free-space wavelength λo, what  is  the  1/e  decay  length α-1  in  the  cladding 
(ε2), where⎯E(x)  =  yˆ Eoe-αx?  Normally D2  is made many  times  thicker  than α-1  to  ensure 
no external attenuation occurs.

Problem 12.2 

A  four-level  laser has equally spaced atomic energy  levels E4 > E3 > 
E2 > E1,  as  illustrated.  Assume  the  spontaneous  transition  rates A41, 
A42, A31, and A32  ≈ 0, while the others are larger.

Problem 12.3 

A  laser diode has  ε = 4εo  and  a  cavity  length 1-mm  long  terminated by one perfect mirror  and 
one  mirror  with  a  power  transmission  coefficient  of  1  percent.    It  operates  at  1-micron 
wavelength and with a natural  linewidth of 0.1 percent associated with  the width of  the energy 
levels involved (Qnatural linewidth  ≈ 103). 

(a)  What is the frequency spacing (Hz) between resonances for this laser cavity? 

(b)  Approximately  how  many  different  frequency  lines  are  emitted  by  this  laser  within  its 
overall natural bandwidth? 

(c)  What  is  the  approximate  width  Δf  of  each  of  these  lines  (Hz)  associated  with  the  cavity 
Qc?  A numerical answer is desired, so Qc must be estimated. 

Problem 12.4 

A  rectangular  acoustic waveguide measures  5×5 millimeters,  similar  to  the  ear  canal  that  runs 
between the outer ear and the eardrum. 

(a)  	 What  are  the  cutoff  frequencies  f0-3  for  the  lowest  four  acoustic modes  for  this waveguide? 
Assume cs = 340 ms-1. 

(b)  What  are  the  two  lowest  resonant  frequencies  f001  and  f002  for  the  resonator bounded by  the 
eardrum and outer ear for an ear canal that is 2-cm long. 

(c)  	 Discuss briefly  (guess  if necessary) how  and why  the  frequencies  found  in parts  (a)  and  (b) 
may relate to the nominal cutoff for human hearing, which is typically 12-20 kHz. 

(d)  	 The  outer  human  ear  has  a  ridge  that  helps  focus  on  the  ear 
canal  sounds arriving  from  the direction  in which  that person 
is facing.  If a single ridge is approximately three centimeters 
from  the  ear  canal,  as  illustrated,  what  frequencies  are 
favored  for  this  forward  focusing  effect?  What  audible 
frequencies  are  partially  nulled?  Note  that  there  are  two 
ridges  in  most  ears,  and  their  spacing  is  a  function  of 
direction.  Explain  briefly  how  this  could  help  our  cavemen 
ancestors determine the direction of an unseen predator.

(e)  	 There  is  a  substantial  acoustic  impedance  discontinuity  at  the  junction  of  the  ear  canal  and 
the  outer  ear  characterized  by  the  power  reflection  coefficient  |Γ|2  at  the  junction.  What  is 
the  approximate  external  QE  of  the  lowest  frequency  mode  for  this  ear-canal  acoustic 
resonator in terms of  |Γ|2?  Note that the power lost to the resonator (ear canal) via radiation 
corresponds to power dissipated in the expression for Q, where QE = QL here.

Problem 12.5 

The velocity of sound in the atmosphere is a function of temperature, and has a nominal value of 
cs  ≅  340  ms-1.  Although  air  temperatures  typically  drop  with  altitude  ~7K  km-1,  there  can  be 
temperature  inversions  for  which  the  air  temperature  actually  increases  with  altitude,  such  as 
when a warm air mass moves  in over a cold  surface  like  that of a  lake.   The acoustic  impedance 
for this problem is ηs  ≅ 425. 

(a)  If 100 watts of 1-kHz acoustic power were confined as a plane wave within 1 square meter, 
what would be the peak acoustic pressure |p| associated with it? 

(b)  What would be the peak acoustic velocity |u|? 

(c)	 What is the peak-to-peak motion D [m] of the air molecules in this wave? 

(d)  If this wave were travelling upward and were incident on a warmer air mass with cs,warm one 
percent greater  than cs  for  the cooler air mass below, what would be  the critical angle θc  for 
this acoustic wave? 

(e)  If  the  angle  of  incidence  on  this  warmer  air  mass  equals  θc  so  that  an  evanescent  acoustic 
wave  is  produced  above  the  interface  that  decays  as  e-αz,  where  z  is  altitude,  what  is  the 
value of α in this singular case? 

Problem 12.6 

A typical closed door consists of a thin massive planar sheet blocking the acoustic path.  Assume 
its  density  ρd  =  1000  kg/m3 while  that  of  air  is  ~ρo  ≅  1  kg/m3.  The  corresponding  velocities  of 
sound cs are 1050 and 330 ms-1, respectively.  Assume normal incidence for all acoustic waves.   

(a)  	 What  is  the  ratio  of  the  characteristic  acoustic  impedances  ηo/ηd  for  the  air  and  the  door? 
(η = ρcs is analogous to Zo.) 

(b)  If the door were infinitely thick, what fraction of the incident acoustic power would the door 
reflect? 

(c)	 What is the lowest acoustic frequency fpass (if any) that could pass through this ideal lossless 
5-cm thick door without any attenuation whatever? 

(d)  	 This 5-cm  thick door has maximum  reflectivity  |Γ|2 at certain  frequencies,  i.e.  its maximum 
power  to  stop  sound; what  is  the  lowest  such  frequency  fstop  and what  is  the  corresponding 
|Γ|2?
