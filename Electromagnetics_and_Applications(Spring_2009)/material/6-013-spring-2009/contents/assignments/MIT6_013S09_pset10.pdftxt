Problem 10.1

(a)  What  far-field  radiation⎯H  is  observed  on 
-
+ 
the coil axis at distance D? 
I 
(b)	 What is the near-field value of⎯H at D?  Hint: use the Biot-Savart formula. 
  
(c)  	 What  is  the maximum  open-circuit  voltage  Vmax  induced  in  a  duplicate  on-axis  coil 
at D?  (Quasi-static question.) 
(d)  The  receiving  coil,  when  shunted  by  a  capacitor  C,  resonates  at  100  kHz.    	For  the 
ideal  case  of  perfectly  conducting  devices,  discuss  briefly  the  physical  phenomenon 
that limits the maximum voltage V(t) that can appear across this resonating coil. 
(e)  	 Assume  the LC  resonator of part  (d) now has  a  small  resistance R  in  series with  the 
coil,  where  R  has  been  adjusted  to  extract  and  dissipate  the  maximum  possible 
power Pmax from  the  transmitter.   What  is Pmax  in  terms of  the radiation resistance Rr 
of the original coil and Vmax?1  Please sketch your equivalent circuit. 
(f)  	 What  technical  issues  and  parameters  might  determine  whether  this  resonance 
method of conveying near-field wireless power has commercial significance?  Might 
resonance  help  far-field  receivers  using  short  dipoles  with  extremely  low  values  of 
Rr?  Explain briefly. 

Problem 10.2 

The  owner  of  an  FM  station  at  100  MHz  can  afford  to  mount  two  half-wave  dipole 
antennas  on  a  tall  tower  to  broadcast  to  the  station’s  isotropically  distributed  listeners, 
none of whom reside in space. 
(a)  	 Sketch  how  the  owner  might  best  mount  the  two  antennas  if  they  are  to 
be fed in perfect phase; include quantitative dimensions, orientations, etc. 
(b)  	 Sketch  and  dimension  two  different  ways  in  which  these  two  antennas 
might  be  mounted  and  phased  in  order  to  achieve  approximately  the

1 For general  interest, an N-turn coil has radiation resistance Rr  ≅ 1.9×104N2(d/λ)4, where d << λ  is  the coil 
diameter.

transmitting much power directly upward.

(c)  	 How  might  two  vertically  polarized  half-wave 
dipoles be positioned and phased  to produce  the 
three-lobe  antenna  gain  pattern  illustrated  to  the 
right?  Briefly explain your reasoning. 
(d)  Many  homeowners  in  this  district  have  flat 
metal  roofs  sloped  at  30o  directly  toward  the 
transmitter,  as  illustrated,  and  use  a  single  half-
wave dipole antenna mounted a distance D from 
the roof.  If the transmitted signal is horizontally 
polarized  and  arrives  from  the  horizon,  what 
should  D  be  to  optimize  reception,  and  how 
metal roof 
should the antenna be oriented? 
(e)  Repeat (d) for a vertically polarized transmitter.  Discuss briefly. 
(f)  	 What  is  the  increase  or  decrease  in  receiver  antenna  gain  G  (dB)  toward  the 
transmitter  relative  to  the  gain  if  the  roof were  removed  and  the  dipole  antenna was 
reoriented in an optimum manner?   Assume the surface of the earth is absorbing and 
recall  that  a  power  ratio  R  in  dB  is  10  log10R,  and  that  power  is  proportional  to 
voltage squared.  You may want to be a little creative.

Problem 10.3 
The  illustrated  cubic  antenna  has  6  arms  at  right  angles, 
each of which is λ/2 long.  What are the antenna gains G in 
each  of  the  x,  y,  and  z  directions,  and  in  each  of  vertical 
and  horizontal  (x,  y,  or  z)  polarization?  (Six  antenna  gains

An  array of 64 y-oriented  short dipole antennas are  spaced uniformly λ/2 apart along  the 
x  axis  and  excited  in  phase  so  as  to  produce maximum  gain  along  the ±  z  axis.   At what 
angle  from  the  z  axis  in  the  x-z  plane  is  the  first  null  in  the  antenna  pattern?    Briefly 
explain your method.
