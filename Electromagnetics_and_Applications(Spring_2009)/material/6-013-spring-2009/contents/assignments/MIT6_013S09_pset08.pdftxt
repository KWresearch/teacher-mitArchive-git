Problem Set 8 (two problems) 

Suggested Reading: 
Course notes, Sections 7.4.1 - 7.4.4;   9.3.1.  Material not on the 
 
next quiz, but that is covered this week and in P.S. 9 includes Sections 9.3.1 - 9.3.2;   9.4. 
 
Quiz 2:	 Reminder  -- Quiz 2, April 16th  (Thursday) during  lecture;  it emphasizes material 
March 1 through April 8 and Problem Sets 5-8 (including this problem set, which 
can  be  delayed  until  Friday,  just  after  the  quiz).    It  is  closed  book  with  a  single 
formula sheet provided in advance, to which formulas may be added.

Problem 8.1 
A  lossless TEM  resonator  of  length D  is  short-circuited  at  one  end  and  open-circuit  at  the 
other, as illustrated.  It is filled with insulator having μ = μo and ε = 4εo. 
(a)  What  are  the  resonant  frequencies  fi  [Hz]  of  this  TEM 
resonator? 
(b)  Please  express  the  complex  current  distribution  I(z)  as  a 
function  of  the  complex  magnitude  Io  of  the  current 
through the short circuit at resonant frequency fi. 
(c)  What 
time-average  magnetic  and  electric 
the 
	are 
energies, wm and we, stored in this resonator at frequency 
fi, in terms of Io? 
(d)  This  resonator  is  then  coupled  to  an  external  matched 
circuit  through  a  TEM  line,  as  illustrated.    Assume  Zo  = 
100Ω.  Approximately what value of δi yields QL = 20 at 
frequency  fi?  (Please  give  the  smallest  value  of  δi  that 
works.) 
(e)  Is this a series or parallel resonance?  What is its half-power bandwidth Δf [Hz]? 
(f)  A very small resistor Ri is then placed in series with Io.  What value of Ri would yield a 
critically  matched  resonator  (one  matched  at  resonance),  assuming  δi  remained 
unchanged?  What then is QL?

Problem 8.2 
All  non-zero  electromagnetic  fields  for  a  certain  mode  (TEm  or  TMm)  of  an  air-filled 
parallel-plate waveguide are  sketched below at a certain  instant of  time.   Waves propagate 
only in the ±z directions. 
(a)  Which  field  lines	  are  electric  and/or 
magnetic?    What  mode  is  this?    Please 
briefly explain your reasoning. 
(b) What  are  kx  and  kz  for  the  illustrated 
mode? 
(c)  What is ω [r/s] for the illustrated wave? 
(d) What  is  the  cutoff  frequency  ωc.o.  for  this 
mode? 
(e)  What is the phase velocity vp for this mode at this frequency? 
(f)  What  is  the  total  time-average  power  flow  [Watts]  in  the  +z  direction  for  the  wave 
(waves)  illustrated  here?    Assume  the  maximum  value  of⎯E(t)  is  3  volts/meter,  if 
needed.  Briefly explain your reasoning.
