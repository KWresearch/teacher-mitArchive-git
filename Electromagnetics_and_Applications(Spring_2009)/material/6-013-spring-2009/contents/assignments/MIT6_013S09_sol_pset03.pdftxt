Problem  3.1 

(a)  Using  the  force/energy  equation,  we  know  that  the  force  attracting  the  two  plates  will  be  equal  to  the 
partial  derivative  of  the  stored  energy  in  the  system  with  respect  to  the  changing  variable  (in  this  case,  d). 

f =  ∂we

We  know  that  the  energy  stored  in  a  capacitor with  a  ﬁxed  charge Q  on  the  plates  is  ωe  =  Q2 d ,  so  the  force

(c)  Consider  a  ring  with  outer  radius  R,  and  width  w,  having  N  segments  (N/2  segments  are  conducting 
plates,  see  diagram  below). 

By  these  conditions,  each  segment  has  angular  width

If  we  place  this  ring  above  an  identical  ring,  than  the  area  of  overlap  of  conducting  plates  will  go  from  zero 
to  (2wR − w2 )π  as  Θ  goes  from  zero  to  Θwidth .  So  we  can  express  the  overlap  area  as  a  function  of  Θ  by 
A = (2wR − w2 ) N Θ = A  Θ,

where A  is a constant (with respect to Θ).  Using this expression, we can calculate capacitance as a  function

If  we  take  the  case  of  one  ring,  with  w = R  and  N  = 4,  then  the  above  expression  becomes  equation  6.2.14 
from  the  notes. 

T 

From  the  notes,  we  know  that  the  power  from  the  %50  duty  cycle  is  P  = T ω/2.  We  know  that  the  angular 
velocity will be  limited by  the maximum  speed of  the outer  edge, wmax  = vmax /R.  So  the mechanical power 
obtained  from  one  ring  is 

P ower = 

(2wR − w2 )N ε  E 2  dvmax
◦  bd
16R 

(3)

To  get  the  highest  power,  we  want  to  put  as  many  segments  as  possible  into  the  total  allowed  volume. 
This  will  happen  when  we  make  w  and  d  as  small  as  possible  and  R  as  large  as  possible  (d  = 0.5 [mm], 
w = 4d = 2 [mm]). 
vol = 1 [L] = 0.001  [m3 ] = dπ(R2  − (R − w)2 ) = dπ(2Rw − w2 ) = π(R8d2  − 16d3 ) 
R =  8πd2  + 4d = 159.16  [m] 
0.001
If we  limit  the  length  of  any  one  segment  to  4d  to  reduce  the  fringing  ﬁelds, we  can  ﬁt N  =  4d  = 500015.8 
2πR 
(but  we  need  N  to  be  an  even  whole  number,  so  choose  N  =  500014)  segments  on  the  ring.  So  the  total 
mechanical  power  becomes: 
P ower =  (2wR−w 2 )N ε ◦ E 2  dvmax  =  (2×0.002×159.16−16×(0.002)2 )×500014×(8.85×10−12 )×(0.0005)×100 E 2

P ower = 5.53 × 10−11  E 2 
bd 
For  Ebd  = 106  [V /m]  this  becomes  P ower = 55.3 [W ] 
(d)  To  get  the  maximum  power  we  want  to  have  a  high  number  of  segments,  but  to  reduce  fringing  ﬁelds 
there  is  a  limit  to  how  small  we  can make  any  individual  segment.  Since  we  were  not  told  how  to make  the 
structure,  we  put  all  the  volume  into  a  single  ring  with  a  159  m  radius.  This  neglects  any  material  used  to 
drive  and  support  the  structure.  See  diagram  below.

(e)  P ower = 55.3 [W ],  and  the  ring  has  a  radius  of  159.16  [m]. 

Problem  3.2 

(a)  From  the  Lorentz  force  law,  we  know  that  electrons  moving  with  velocity  v¯ will  experience  a  force 
f ¯ =  −e(E ¯ + ¯v × µ H¯ ).  In  the  case  of  a  conductor  moving  through  a  magnetic  ﬁeld,  this  force  will  cause 
◦
electrons  to  move  within  the  conductor  until  the  electric  forces  due  to  the  distribution  of  electrons  balance 
the magnetic  forces  due  to  the  conductors  motion. 

Using  the  notation  in  the  following  diagram,  we  can  pretend  that  Io  is  moving  through  the  magnetic  ﬁeld 
H ¯ = −yˆ 10−4  [A/m]  with  velocity  ¯v = ˆz  7200[m/s].
µ◦ 
If  the  electric  and magnetic  forces  are  balanced,  than  f  is  zero,  so  we  can  solve  for  the  electric  ﬁeld  in  terms 
of  the  magnetic  ﬁeld. 
f ¯ = −e(E ¯ + ¯v × µ H¯ ) = 0 
◦ 
E ¯ = −v¯ × µ H ¯ = − ˆ
z v × − ˆ
◦
◦ 
y µ H
E ¯ = − ˆxµ vH 
◦ 
Noting  that  the  ﬁeld  is  constant  within  the  conductor,  we  know  that  the  potential  diﬀerence  V  across  the 
conductor  will  be  the  product  of  the  ﬁeld  and  the  length  of  the  conductor,  V  =  E d  (in  this  case,  d  is  the 
width  of  Io). 
V  = dµ vH  = (3340 × 103 )(7200)(10−4 ) = 2.4 × 106  [V ].
◦ 
Knowing the direction of the induced electric ﬁeld, −xˆ, we can determine that the side of Io closest to Jupiter 
will  accumulate  a  negative  charge  (if  no  other  current  path  exists). 

(b)  Electrons  will  ﬂow  from  the  side  of  Io  closest  Jupiter,  along  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  lines,  through  Jupiter’s 
ionosphere,  and  back  to  the  Io.  Through  Io  this  results  in  a  ﬂow  of  electrons  along  −xˆ (see  diagram),  with 
a  current 
I ¯ =  ˆx 2.4×106 [V ]

(a) To calculate the  inductance of the device, we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd the magnitude of the H ﬁeld  in the device. 
Using Ampere’s law we can relate the magnitude of the H ﬁeld (inside the iron and  in the gap) to the current 
through the N turns of the wire on the  iron circle.  This  is equation 3.2.19  in the notes.  Applying the relation 
µHµ  = µ Hg  (from  the  fact  that  perpendicular B  ﬁeld  is  continuous  from  the  iron  into  the  gap)  to  equation 
◦
3.2.19  we  can  ﬁnd  the  magnitude  of  the  H  ﬁeld  in  the  gap.

If  we  assume  that  the  gap  stores  nearly  all  the  energy  in  the  device,  we  can  reduce  this  expression  to 
Hg  =  d  .

Using  this  H  ﬁeld  in  equation  3.2.16  gives  the  inductance  of  the  device  as

(b)  To  ﬁnd  the  force  pulling  the  gap  closed  apply  the  force  energy  equation  to  the  energy  stored  in  the 
device.  In  the capacitor case,  the constant was  total charge on one of  the plates.  In  the case  for  the  inductor 
we’ll  look  at  constant  Λ = Li  (short  circuit  the  coil  while  still  allowing  current  to  ﬂow).  The  energy  stored 
2  [J ]  by  equation  3.2.23  and  3.2.16.  So,  the  force  pulling  the  gap  closed  is 
in  an  inductor  is  wm  =  2

It  is  also  possible  to  solve  this  problem  using  the  pressure  on  the  surface  of  the  rod  at  the  gap  due  to  the

(c)  When  d  =  0  there  is  no  gap,  so  the  H  ﬁeld  inside  the  iron  cylinder  becomes  H  =  Hµ  =  D  giving  an

(d) The B ¯  ﬁeld emerges from the high permeability torus nearly at right angles, and therefore representative 
B ¯  ﬁeld  lines  might  include  those  illustrated  here  (plus  others,  not  drawn).

(e)  From  equation  3.2.13  we  know  that  the  voltage  across  the  coil  is  the  derivative  of  the  ﬂux  linkage,  Λ. 
The  ﬂux  linkage  is
