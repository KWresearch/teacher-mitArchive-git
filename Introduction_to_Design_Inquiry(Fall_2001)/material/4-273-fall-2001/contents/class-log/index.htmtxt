                                           assignments, and introduced the

1      Introduction/Woodland Cemetery
                                           This was followed by a slide
                                           presentation of the Woodland
                                           Cemetery in Stockholm, and finally a
                                           demo of studioMIT by Janet.
                                           There were presentations of
                                           assignment 1 by 3 groups:

                                           The class began with sharing of
                                           personal thoughts and reflections on
                                           the events of a year ago.

                                           Bill discussed the recording of
                                           classes with the students, who
                                           agreed to allow this to happen for
                                           the benefit of the class and Bill's
                                           research. More details on policy

                                           corresponding to their subject.
                                           The remaining presentations of
                                           assignment 1:

                                           This class was spent discussing the

                                           The Infinite Corridor assignment was
                                           then discussed. Most members of the
                                           class presented their personal
                                           experiences and feelings towards the
                                           infinite corridor to begin with,
                                           which covered a wide range. Then
                                           people who had written a piece based
                                           on Jane Jacob's text presented their
                                           work, which was discussed.
                                           Presentation and discussion on

                                           discussion.
                                           Two presentations of the
                                           'Replication' assignment were made
                                           in class. The first was on the MIT
                                           chapel, by Rita, John, Alexandra and
                                           Jen. This developed into an extended
                                           class discussion about the
                                           development of the design of the
7      Replication (Assignment 3)          building and possible processes and
                                           strategies employed by Saarinen.

                                           The second group presented the
                                           Simmons Hall building at MIT by
                                           Holl, but there was no time for
                                           discussion before the end of class.
                                           This will take place at the start of
                                           next class.

                                           model which was first passed around

                                           some time examining it and trying to
                                           work it out.
                                           There was some further discussion of

                                           book at the start of class. This was
                                           followed by a discussion of the last

                                           presentation of the remaining two
                                           projects for assignment 7:
                                           James, Hans, Keru, Stylianos:
                                           Brunelleschi's church plan.
                                           Rita, Jen, Alexandra, Johanne:
21     Takehiko Nagakura (Continued)       Rossi's facade.
                                           There was also some discussion of
                                           evolutionary design methods using
                                           algorithms, and concurrency. James
                                           gave the example of musicians who
                                           use computers as partners in the
                                           'design' of their music.
                                           With Ben Loomis:
                                           We played 3 rounds of the game based
                                           on the evolutionary design model.
                                           The first round was a simple
                                           geometric shape, the second was
22     Evolutionary Design Game            'worms eye view', and the third was
       (Assignment 8)                      the floor plan of Kahn's Exeter
                                           library. Each time the right answer
                                           was found after 5 or 6 rounds.
                                           Then Ben gave a presentation of the
                                           principles of evolutionary design,
                                           and gave out assignment 8.
                                           John Gero spoke to the class about
                                           the role of genetic algorithms in
23     John Gero                           design, and presented some research
                                           he had done including using Mondrian
                                           and Frank Lloyd Wright's windows to
                                           create 'Flondrain' designs.
24     John Gero (Continued)               No notes.
                                           The first half of the class was a
                                           presentation by John Alex on the use
25     John Alex + Edith Ackermann         of computers in design. The second
                                           half was a discussion with Edith
                                           Ackermann on the readings assigned
                                           for the class.
                                           During the first part of the class
                                           Bill presented an analysis of music
                                           as an example rule-based design, and
                                           played several pieces on the piano.
26     Music Class
                                           In the second part of the class
                                           James Tichenor made a presentation
                                           giving a brief overview of
                                           generative systems in electronic
                                           music.
                                           3 groups presented their
                                           assignments:

                                           Janet, Hans, James, John, Luke and
                                           Sameer with Yoko Ono inspired
27     Meaning of Meaning (Assignment 9 +  instructions for design.
       10)                                 Victor, Goncalo and Alexander with
                                           set of rules to create a shading
                                           device in a 5x5x5 cube of boxes.
                                           Jen, Rita, Johanne, Alexandra with a
                                           class exercise to interpret a
                                           Calvino piece.
