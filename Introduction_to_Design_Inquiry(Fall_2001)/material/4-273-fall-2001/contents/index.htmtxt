***** Course Description *****
Introduction to Design Inquiry explores the nature and exercise of design
intelligence. It aims to open avenues for further research and, along them, to
open vistas on the teaching of design and on more mindful professional design
practices.
We see design as processes located in individuals and groups, shaped by the
formation and experience of each individual and by the characteristics of the
groups that play a role in the design process. People construct the worlds they
inhabit out of what they know and have experienced. So also does the designer,
but the designerâs worlds must be possible for others to inhabit and,
therefore, to construct. Indeed the success of a design depends in large part
on the degree to which these constructive processes yield similar results.
