Assignment 1 

A Bottle of Wine 

If one tries to engage worlds through objects and understand how these objects 
actually enable us to understand the world, a bottle could reflect upon this idea. We 
found this engagement in a "simple" bottle of wine for its functional aspects on one 
hand as well as its semiotic aspects on the other. 

Its functional aspects of the bottle go far beyond a simple container of liquid. The 
particular shape of the bottle defines the quality of the wine, the position in which it 
should be stored and how it should be poured. 

In addition to its functional aspects, the bottle communicates within itself the idea of 
gathering, tradition and culture. Thus a bottle gathers people together and becomes 
a vehicle to create an atmosphere. It forces itself from the outside into its own circle 
and everyone relates to this circle. Outside itself it has a meaning and within itself it 
has a meaning. From the outside it is a container and within itself it involves all of 
the senses of the body. All of these senses are utilized during the ritual of holding 
the glass and drinking the wine - sight, smell, touch, taste. Both the sensual 
perception and the intellectual perception are engaged. 

We will discuss more specific examples of these points in class.
