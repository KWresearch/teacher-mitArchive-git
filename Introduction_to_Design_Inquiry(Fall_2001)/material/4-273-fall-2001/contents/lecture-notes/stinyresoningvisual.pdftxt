WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL? 

GEORGE STINY 
MIT 

Abstract.  How to stop counting and start seeing. 

My line of thought 

I’d like to take a stab at the following question from the point of view 
of someone who thinks about design.  I ’m mostly interested in how I can come 
up  with  something  new  when  I  calculate  with  shapes.  How  creative  can  I 
possibly  be  if  I  use  rules?  Am  I  any  more  creative  if  I  don ’ t?  I  won ’ t  say 
anything else about this, but keep it in mind.  My question right now has to do 
with seeing: 

(1) When is reasoning visual? 

That I come from MIT where the motto is ‘Minds and Hands’ — I’m 
told   this   means   theory   and   practice   —   may   put   me   at   something   of   a  
disadvantage when it comes to original thinking about minds and eyes. Anyone 
who has seen MIT knows  instantly  that no one  there pays much attention  to 
how  things  look,  even  with  a  distinguished  architectural  tradition  including 
Aalto and today Siza, Maki, Gehry, and Correa.  MIT is not a visual place.  I ’m 
going to try and see anyway. 

I’m not daring enough to attack question (1) directly .  My first thought 
was to tackle two additional questions and to take a route through their answers 
that appeared to me more clearly marked: 

(2) When is calculating visual? 
(3) Does reasoning include calculating? 

If the answer to question (3) is a solid yes and I can answer question (2), then 
I can use visual calculating as a working model to understand visual reasoning. 
This is reasoning by inference — from the properties of a part to the properties 
of the whole.  And this is how everything is related

if  it all  fits  together  the way  it ’ s supposed  to.  But  the  longer  I  looked at my 
neat  little  diagram  —  is  this  visual  reasoning?  —  the more  I  thought  about 
which way  the  inclusions should go.  Maybe  the relationships are really  like 
this

so that reasoning and calculating are merely special cases of visual reasoning 
and visual calculating.  In fact, I ’m sure each of my diagrams is correct in its 
own  way,  and  have  already  established  the  underlying  equivalencies  for 
calculating by counting and alternatively by seeing.  (Counting is the standard 
model.  I’ll return to the idea that calculating is normative later on.)  Some of 
you may be familiar with the details.  They involve the algebras of shapes Ui j

and whether basic elements in shapes are points with dimension i = 0, or lines, 
planes,  or  solids  with  dimension  i  >  0.  And  then  there  are  a  number  of 
technical  devices  including,  for  example,  analytic  descriptions  of  basic 
elements  and  their  boundaries,  canonical  representations  of  shapes  using 
maximal elements, and reduction rules to compare shapes and combine them. 
But right now, I’d like to take a more leisurely , conversational approach.  There’ s 
no reason to insist on rigor in Bellagio on Lake Como in the summer.

WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


First I show that calculating is part of reasoning, and then by analogy 
—  how many  kinds  of  reasoning  are  there  anyway?  —  conclude  that  visual 
calculating  is  part  of  visual  reasoning.  And  I  go  on  to  present  some  of  the 
evidence I ’ve found for visual calculating.  My plan is the same.  What I glean 
from   visual   calculating   will   tell   me   what   I   need   to   know   about   visual  
reasoning.  This  is  a  discursive  process  that  runs  by  logic  or  desultory 
rambling.  I’m not too fond of logic and avoid it if I can.  So I’m apt to ramble 
aimlessly.  Roaming  around  to  see  what ’ s  what  is  a  more  effective  way 
(procedure) to get new and useful results.  But the ambiguity of this process — 
sometimes  logic  and  sometimes  not  —  isn ’
t  wasted.  It  shows  better  than 
anything  I  can  say  why  visual  calculating  and  so  reasoning  are  important. 
They ’re the only way I know to deal with ambiguity and novelty , and not give 
up on calculating as a creative part of thought.  This is the key if calculating is 
to model visual reasoning. 

Some of you may have already decided that my line of thought is only 
engineering.  It may be practical to use models and the like, but it ’ s unlikely to 
lead to fresh insights of the kind you have come to hear.  I won’ t argue that I’m 
not doing engineering.  I’m more confident about calculating than I ever will 
be about reasoning.  I can point to examples of calculating — including one or 
two  of my  own  invention  —  but  I ’m  never  sure  about  reasoning.  My  own 
reasoning when it goes beyond calculating is as suspect as any.  If I think I ’ve 
got a really good argument, someone soon comes along and pokes holes in it. 
And it’ s the same if I try to follow the reasoning of others.  I go from thinking 
I’m thinking to thinking I’m not.  This is the sort of abstruse game philosophers 
like to play.  It’ s hard, and it goes on and on forever.  I’m no philosopher .  I’m 
a  lot  happier  with  the  more  accessible  pleasures  of  engineering.  I  like  to 
calculate and to get sensible results. 

But what about  fresh  insights?  Everybody  is always on  the  lookout 
for something new.  Is there any reason to buy into my three questions if it ’ s 
not  going  to  go  anywhere  new  and  different?  I ’m  always  surprised  at  how 
much more there is to calculating than I expect at the beginning.  What surprises 
me the most is that the best surprises don ’ t come from clever ways of counting 
or complicated coding tricks that take real brain power — from what ’
s valued 
and encouraged in calculating — but straight from seeing.  Let ’ s see just how 
visual  calculating works.  I  can’ t  be  sure  before  I  show  you,  but  I’m  almost 
positive  that  you ’re  going  to  be  surprised  at  how  much  there  is  to  visual 
reasoning if it ’ s like visual calculating.

Does reasoning include calculating? 

I want to show that reasoning includes calculating.  Most of the people 
I ’ve asked agree that it does, but only as a narrow kind of process among many 
other kinds of greater scope that contribute more to thinking.  Even so, I need 
to show this to go on: I need an account of reasoning that ’ s like calculating, so 
that  I  can  explain  visual  reasoning  in  terms  of  visual  calculating.  I  won ’ t 
develop an account of my own from scratch.  Others have done this —  Thomas 
Hobbes  was  apparently  the  first  one  —  in  a  variety  of  dif
ferent  ways  from 
which I can select.  This may take some reasoning — at least a little judgment 
if not actual calculating — but the stakes aren’
t high.  There’ s enough agreement 
to decide on aesthetic grounds alone.  There ’ s no  reason  for careful analysis 
and  rigorous  argument.  This  is  the  kind  of  everyday  choice  that ’ s  easy  to 
make, but that’ s hard to justify beyond its results.  This is the kind of choice I 
like. 

The American pragmatist William James gives an account of reasoning 
in The Principles of Psychology that lets me start.  For James, reasoning is a 
compound process with interlocking parts.  He divides the ‘art of the reasoner ’ 
into moieties: 

First, sagacity, or the ability to discover what part, M, lies 
embedded in the whole S which is before him; 
Second,  learning,  or  the  ability  to  recall  promptly  M ’ s 
consequences, concomitants, or implications. 

This is exactly what happens when rules are used to calculate.  There’ s 
the part M to be embedded in the whole S and the consequences, etc.  — call 
them P — of finding M in S.  The rule M → P applies to S to produce something 
new.  Of course, this is only a gloss.  It leaves out most of the important details. 
I  have  to  say  a  lot more  about  how  the  rule works when  it ’ s  used.  The  real 
trick  is  to  find  a  suitable  embedding  relation,  and  to  show  how  M  can  be 
embedded in S, and how together with P, this changes S. 

James  takes  the  syllogism  as  his  example  —  this  only  confirms  the 
link  to  calculating  — with  almost  no  attention  to  the  underlying  details  that 
make rules work.  But he has something else far more interesting and weighty 
in  mind.  He  wants  to  plumb  creative  thinking  and  describe  the  source  of 
originality.  In fact, James’ s overarching definition of reasoning is the ability 
to deal with novelty.  Isn’ t this why reasoning — especially the visual kind — 
makes a difference? 

4


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


If we glance at the ordinary syllogism — 
M is P; 
S is M; 
∴  S is P 
— we see that the second or minor premise, the ‘subsumption ’ as it 
is  sometimes  called,  is  the  one  requiring  the  sagacity;  the  first  or 
major the one requiring the fertility, or fulness of learning.  Usually, 
the learning is more apt to be ready than the sagacity, the ability to 
seize fresh aspects in concrete things being rarer than the ability to 
learn old rules; so that, in most actual cases of reasoning, the minor 
premise, or the way of conceiving the subject, is the one that makes 
the novel step in thought.  This is, to be sure, not always the case; for 
the  fact  that M  carries  P  with  it  may  also  be  unfamiliar  and  now 
formulated for the first time. 

I think James is right about ‘the novel step in thought’.  Embedding — 
‘the  ability  to  seize  fresh  aspects  in  concrete  things ’
  —  is  the  key .  And  I ’ll 
give a more faceted account of the embedding relation as I go on.  Of course, 
reasoning that works isn’ t always surprising, but it may be if it doesn’ t.  Let’ s 
look  at  an  example  of  this  that  shows  a  few  details  of  embedding,  and  how 
rules make use of them.  My example deals with line drawings (shapes), but 
this  doesn ’ t  mean  it ’ s  visual.  Whether  or  not  seeing  relies  on  reasoning, 
calculating needn’ t involve seeing.  In fact, my example shows how calculating 
and  seeing may  disagree.  There ’ s  got  to  be  a  way  to  reconcile  them  if  I ’m 
going to show how visual calculating and hence reasoning are possible. Again, 
embedding is the key. 

A first look at calculating 

T. G. Evans — an aboriginal computer scientist — uses the rules of a 
‘grammar ’  to define shapes in terms of their  ‘lowest level constituents’
  — or 
alternatively atoms, components, primitives, units, and the like.  This illustrates 
some notions that have been used widely in computer applications for a long 
time.  But in fact, these ideas are as fresh today as they ever were.  (Rules like 
this were applied early on in ‘picture languages ’ to combine picture atoms and 
fragments, and later in Christopher Alexander ’ s much better known but formally 
derivative  ‘pattern  language ’.  My  own  set  grammars  are  also  comparable, 
even if more ambitious: they ’re the same as  Turing machines.) 

Evans ’ s grammar contains rules like this one 

5


G. STINY 

Three lines → Triangle 

that  defines  triangles  in  the  ordinary  way  as  polygons  with  three  sides.  In 
order to show how the rule works, I first have to give the embedding relation, 
and  then  tell  what  options  there  are  to  satisfy  it.  For  Evans,  embedding  is 
identity among constituents.  (This is what happens when i is zero in the algebras 
Ui j.)  The rule applies to a shape if all of it’ s constituents — or more generally 
for any rule in a recursive scheme, the constituents the rule implies — are also 
in the shape.  The constituents in the rule may be transformed as an arrangement 
—  moved  around  freely ,  reflected,  or  scaled  —  to  obtain  a  correspondence 
with constituents in the shape. 

Evans uses this shape 

as an example.  The shape has a finite set of constituents.  It ’ s 24 line segments 
that are each defined by its endpoints: first there are the four sides of the large 
square and their halves 

then the two diagonals of the square and their halves 

and finally the horizontal and the vertical and their halves 

And Evans ’ s rule — the one I showed above — applies without a hitch to pick 

6


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


out  the  16  triangular  parts  of  the  shape:  eight  small  triangles,  four  medium 
ones, and four large ones 

This is really pretty neat.  In fact, it ’ s very clever coding.  If there were only 
eight  long  lines  in  the  shape,  then  there would  just be  large  triangles and no 
small  or medium  ones.  And  if  lines  were  only  halves,  then  there  would  be 
three distinct kinds of triangles 

not all with three sides, that I would have to define in separate rules.  This isn ’ t 
what I know about triangles or what I actually see.  But Evans ’ s grammar gets 
around all of this artfully.  The grammar is seeing what I do, when a solitary 
rule of no great complexity — merely three lines — is used to calculate. 
What 
else do rules and constituents imply?  How far can I go with this? 

I can give rules for squares and rectangles — four lines apiece — bow 
ties of distinct shapes — again four lines apiece — and visually homonymous 
stars  — one type defined by four lines and the other type by eight halves 

������� 
�������� 
And my rules find all of these figures wherever they are in the shape: there are 
five  squares,  four  rectangles,  six  bow  ties,  and  a  star  of  each  type.  This  is 
great.  But already, there are signs of trouble.  I can ’ t tell the stars apart just by 
looking at them, even if I can by the rule I apply.  Calculating and seeing are 
beginning to look different. 

Now suppose I go on to define an additional rule 

Line → 

7


G. STINY


that erases lines — the lowest level constituents — in Evans ’
s shape.  What do 
I get if I apply my new rule to erase the lines in all small triangles, or medium 
or large ones?  Whatever happens, I don ’ t expect to see the lines I ’ve removed 
in my  result.  If  I  do  the  erasing  by  hand  to  remove  the  lines  I  see  in  small 
triangles, the shape disappears.  And for medium or large triangles — erasing 
what I see by hand — I get a Greek cross that looks like this 

But in all three cases when I calculate with the rule, my results look like this 

Seeing is believing.  Some parts are hard to delete when I use my eyes, even 
after I ’ve applied the rule.  The shape is visually intact whichever lines I erase. 
You  can  check  me  if  you  like.  I  haven ’ t  made  any  careless  mistakes,  yet  I 
don ’ t get what I expect.  I must be seeing things.  Actually, I am.  The lines I ’ve 
erased with the rule aren ’ t there.  No two of the resulting shapes are the same 
—  they ’re numerically distinct with eight, 16, and 18 constituents apiece  — 
and they’re all dif ferent than the shape I started with.  But how can I tell which 
shape is which if I merely look?  How can anyone, without consulting someone 
else?  God might know, but I ’m left with experts and quacks.  Who do I ask to 
tell them apart?  I ’m lucky I don ’
t have to trust my eyes.  There ’ s a better way. 
I  can  calculate  to  find  out.  I  can  keep  track  of  where  I ’ve  used  the  rule  to 
distinguish what I can ’ t see.  This may not be the kind of novelty James has in 
mind. 

Seeing is confused in other ways as well, when it comes to calculating 
in Evans ’ s grammar.  Many parts  that are easy  for me  to see  —  there are no 
tricks,  you  can  see  the  same  parts  yourselves  —  are  impossible  for  rules  to 
find.  Take the triaxial motif 

8

with equilateral arms.  I can define the Y — there are also other letters from  A 
to Z  — in the rule 

Three lines → Y 

The Y appears indefinitely many times

����� 

yet  the  rule  —  or  any  other  rule  —  can’
t  find  it,  not  even  once.  All  of my 
results are correct.  This is calculating, but it isn’ t seeing.  What ’ s gone wrong? 
All of a sudden, Evans ’ s grammar is blind.  Is there always something that ’ s 
going to be missed when I calculate?  It ’ s not because I can ’ t define precisely 
what I want to find.  I can do that for any shape I like.  But surely, there ’ s got 
to be some way to see Y.  Maybe it should be defined in the rule 

Three lines → WHY? 

This  takes  me  to  real  homonyms.  What  I  thought  at  first  was  seeing  isn ’ t 
seeing  at  all.  It ’ s  hearing.  Sensible  experience  is much  the  same  from  one 
modality to the next.  It’ s ambiguous.  Parts are forever fusing and dividing.  Is 
this going too far?  I don ’ t know.  I don ’ t think James would think so.  It ’ s more 
than likely that he would welcome the novelty.  One of his students gave us the 
notorious line  ‘A  rose is . . . a rose ’.  Why can ’ t I see Y when I calculate? 

Let ’ s see how the shape 

is put together, and what this implies about what I can see.  The 24 constituents 
(line segments) in the shape include eight long lines 

9


G. STINY


and their 16 halves 

Each long line contains two halves, and each half is contained in a long line. 
This gives me the 16 triangles I want.  But if I erase a long line, there are two 
halves that visually compensate for the loss.  And if I erase any half, there ’ s a 
long line that fills in.  The shape is going to look exactly the same, even as its 
constituents change.  Calculating multiplies distinctions I simply can ’ t see. 

(A productive way to explore the depths of Evans ’ s shape is to count 
the different kinds of triangles it contains.  Small triangles always have three 
lines, medium ones have three to five lines, and large ones have three to nine 
lines.  Lines are taken from these schemes 

There are five distinct configurations for each grouping of three collinear lines 

So there are five versions of each medium triangle, and 125 of each large one. 
The census is given in Table 1.  More is happening in Evans ’ s shape than I can 
possibly see.  What use are my eyes when nearly everything is hidden?  I ’ve 
no doubt that Evans’ s shape contains 16 triangles with three lines apiece.  Seeing 
is believing.  But it’ s only a half  — actually 3%  — truth.)

Of course when I erase a long line, I can also remove it ’ s halves at the 
same time.  This takes another rule 

Three collinear lines → 

but gives some interesting results.  I get a Greek cross (two lines) and another 
one (four halves) — at least this looks right — erasing the sides of lar
ge triangles 

a star (four lines) and a Greek cross (four halves) — or maybe the star is a pair 
of crosses (two lines apiece), but that’ s OK — for the sides of medium triangles 

and this  — it’

s eight lines  — for the sides of small triangles 

This  is a marked  improvement, and  it suggests more.  If  I add  the conjugate 
rule for halves 

Two collinear lines → 

11 


G. STINY


so that the long line that contains a half is erased at the same time the half is, 
then I get the visual results I ’m looking for .  I started with a single rule to erase 
a  line,  and  now  have  three  rules  that  have  to  be  applied  judiciously.  But  so 
what? The grammar is fixed, even if the new rules are ad hoc. 

(This  reminds  me  of  the  old  joke  about  an  MIT  engineer.  In  fact, 
Evans hails from MIT, too.  Anyway, the engineer is going to be guillotined. 
The  blade  falls  fast  and  stops  scarcely  short  of  his  neck.  He  looks  up  and 
points — ‘I can fix that! ’ 
And so he does to show he ’ s sharp and to collect his 
reward.  Poor sap: nobody told him that hard problems — the only kind worth 
thinking  about  at MIT  — don ’
t necessarily have useful  answers.  No matter 
what  kind  of  research  you  do,  it ’ s  got  to  be  very  complicated.  This  shouts, 
‘Hey!  —  I’m  from MIT
 Good  ideas  aren’ t meant  to  be  interesting  or  fun. 
.’
They  have  to  be  hard  to  show  your  worth.  The  more  I  think  about  visual 
calculating and how to do it, the more I ’m sure that it ’ s the uncomplicated, the 
vague, and the ambiguous that matter the most in both research and education. 
It ’ s much  better  to  be  flexible  than  tough.  Shapes  are  full  of miscellaneous 
possibilities.  You never know what else there is to see.) 

But what about the Y?  Why can ’ t the rule 

Three lines → Y 

find  it when  I can see  it almost everywhere  I  look?  While  there may be  too 
many constituents to erase the lines in triangles, there aren’ t enough constituents 
to  find  even  a  single Y.  One  or  two  segments  can  be  found  in  a  number  of 
places 

but never  three segments at once.  New constituents can always be added  to 
complete Y ’ s 

12 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


(What do additional constituents do when I try to erase the lines in triangles? 
How do they change the census of triangles in Table 1?)  Yet no matter what I 
do, there are never going to be enough constituents to find all of the Y ’ s there 
are to see.  I can ’ t specify (anticipate) everything I might see before I ’ve had a 
chance to look.  What about other letters from A to Z?  What about big K ’ s and 
little k ’ s?  What about stars and crosses

Evans’ s constituents miss most of them.  My analysis has got to stop sometime, 
and when it does, calculating goes blind.  Analysis may be an essential part of 
reasoning — maybe it ’
s a prerequisite — but it seems only to get in the way of 
seeing. 

Neither the surplus of lines nor the lack of Y ’ s  — and other parts  — 
seems right.  What I see and what Evans implies I should when I calculate are 
just  not  the  same.  Must  calculating  and  visual  experience  be  related  so 
haphazardly?  There ’ s  a  huge  gap  to  bridge  between minds  and  eyes  if  I ’m 
ever going to get anywhere with visual calculating.  Visual reasoning is long 
out of sight.  But hold on.  Is the gap real, or an example of not thinking that 
can be addressed without appealing endlessly to ad hoc devices? 

The problem with Evans’ s grammar is completely artificial — if you’re 
t 
still  with  me,  you ’ve  probably  decided  all  calculating  is  —  and  it  needn ’
really occur.  Evans uses a zero dimensional embedding relation that ’ s meant 
for points to calculate with shapes made up of one dimensional line segments. 
(This amounts to confusing the algebras Ui j for i = 0 and i = 1.)  This appears 
trivial enough, but the disparity has two bewildering consequences. 

First, the shape 

13 


G. STINY


has no obvious constituents to serve as points.  It ’ s easy to see that lines come 
undivided.  How can I cut these two 

in  a  meaningful  way  without  knowing  beforehand  what  rules  there  are  and 
how  I ’m  going  to  use  them? 
Internally,  the  lines  are  homogeneous.  And 
externally,  their  relationship  is  arbitrary.  This  is  how  it  is  for  lines  in  any 
arrangement.  I just can ’ t be sure how many.  Lines aren ’ t numerically distinct 
like points.  They fuse and divide freely.  I can draw two lines to make a Greek 
cross 

and then see alternating pairs of L’ s 

or I can turn this around and draw L’ s — two or more — and see a Greek cross. 
Nevertheless, I ’ve decided to calculate.  So I ’ve got to define points explicitly 
in whatever way  I  can  think up  according  to my present  interests  and goals. 
Right  now,  I ’m  looking  for  triangles. 
Is  this  circular  reasoning  or  what? 
Reasoning obviously comes in shapes of various kinds.  If I look the right way, 
this circle appears almost hermeneutic.  I ’ve got  to  find  triangles  to define a 
rule to find triangles, or something along these lines.  Seeing and calculating 
are linked.  That’ s for sure.  But perhaps their relationship is not what I want. 
Seeing may be finished  — completed if not done for  — before I calculate at 
all.  What would calculating be like if there were no problem to solve before 
calculating to solve a problem? 

And second, after I determine these points, I have to keep to them for 
as long as I calculate.  There ’ s no way to start over with another analysis.  I ’m 
told constantly that it ’ s cheating if I do.  It ’ s incoherent.  (Emerson is famous 
for the opposite view.  ‘A  foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds 
. . .  With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. ’  Today the first 

14 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


sentence is only a cliché. As a student I used it as a reason to be silly.  But the 
following  sentence  is  the  real  clincher.  If  the  analysis  I ’ve  already  got  is  a 
special description that controls my ongoing experience, then what am I free 
to do?  There are no surprises left.  Why not change my mind?  What stops me 
from seeing something new?  I can ’ t imagine a consistency that ’ s not foolish 
sooner  or  later  if  I  calculate with  shapes.  What  I  see may  alter  erratically.) 
There’ s an underlying description of the shape 

that depends on how I ’ve defined constituents before I begin to calculate.  The 
description isn ’ t anywhere to see.  It ’ s hidden out of sight and isn ’ t supposed 
to  intrude.  Only  it  limits  everything  I  do  and  everything  I  see.  There’ s  no 
problem, so long as I continue to experience the same things and my goals stay 
the same  — if nothing ever changes.  Otherwise, it ’ s nearly impossible to try 
anything new  — to erase lines or find  Y ’ s  — and not run into trouble. 

Evans  isn ’ t  entirely  to  blame  for  this  choice  of  embedding  relation. 
He uses concepts like ‘three lines are a triangle ’ to describe what he sees in the 
expected way when it comes to making computer models.  This amounts to the 
following: take things that aren’ t zero dimensional and go calculate with them 
as if they were.  There are abundant examples of this — from computer graphics, 
imaging, and fractal modeling, to engineering analysis and weather forecasting, 
to  complex  adaptive  systems  of  every  kind.  Finite  elements  —  atoms, 
components, lowest level constituents, primitives, units, etc. — are combined 
to  describe  things  that  aren ’ t  sensibly  divided.  It ’ s  a  very  powerful method 
with  an  ancient  history  and  an  amazing  record  of  success.  It ’ s  what  most 
thinking is like at MIT, and it works like magic.  That’ s right, it’ s an illusion.  It 
may be exposed when calculating and sensible experience are asked to agree 
too  closely.  Only  this  isn ’ t  new.  James  has  his  own  examples  of  the  ‘many 
ways in which the conceptual transformation of perceptual experience makes 
it less comprehensible than ever. ’
 Have I taken a wrong turn?  Maybe there ’ s 
no  such  thing  as  visual  calculating.  Are  clear  negative  examples  reason  to 
give  up,  or  reason  to  try  another way?  What  kind  of  evidence would  count 
otherwise?  I have to show that analysis isn’ t something you do first in order to 
calculate, but rather something that changes or evolves — even discontinuously 
— as one of the by-products of calculating.  Analysis develops as calculating 
goes on.  What I do while I calculate and not before — what rules I ’ve got and 
what I do with them  — determines what constituents are.

When is calculating visual? 

Sometimes I try an informal rule of thumb to decide when calculating 
is visual.  Both the dimension (dim) of the elements (el) and the dimension of 
the embedding relation (em) used to calculate are the same.  I can state this in 
a nifty little formula that ’ s a good mnemonic: 

dim(el) = dim(em) 

I’m  pretty  sure  the  rule  is  suf ficient:  whenever  my  formula  is  satisfied,  it’ s 
visual  calculating.  I ’m  just  not  so  sure  the  rule  is  necessary .  There may  be 
examples  of  visual  calculating  that  don ’ t  meet  this  standard.  Whatever  the 
answer  —  and  I ’m  ready  to  bet  on  the  formula  —  I  want  the  equivalence 
(biconditional) 

dim(el) = 0 ≡ dim(em) = 0 

to be satisfied,  to ensure  that zero dimensional embedding relations are only 
used with zero dimensional elements. 

As  formulas  go,  mine  is  pretty  vague.  I  don ’ t  say  how  to  evaluate 
either  side  except  in  a  few  ad  hoc  cases.  But  all  of my  examples  of  visual 
calculating are synthetic, so the formula is enough for the time being.  There ’ s 
no  reason  to  avoid  vague  ideas  when  they  stimulate  calculating.  In  fact, 
vagueness may be indispensable to what I ’m trying to show .  I can ’ t imagine 
anything  vaguer  —  or  more  ambiguous  —  than  a  shape  that  isn’
t  divided 
(analyzed) into constituents, so that it ’ s without definite parts and any obvious 
purpose.  I ’m  going  to  use my  formula  to  get  to  the  idea  that  calculating  is 
visual if it can deal with shapes like this.  I want to use rules to determine what 
parts I see and what I can say about them, and to allow for what I see and what 
I say to change freely as I calculate. And I want this to happen every time I try 
a rule.  I’m told calculating is a good example of what it means to be discursive: 
sometimes  when  I  calculate  it  looks  logical,  but  most  of  the  time  it ’ s  only 
desultory  rambling with my  eyes.  Shapes  should  be  ambiguous  and  vague, 
and ready to use when I calculate. 

So  what  can  I  do  to  make  Evans ’ s  example  visual?  My  formula 
provides twin options.  I can change the elements in Evans ’ s shape from lines 
to points, so that dim(el) = dim(em), or I can use another embedding relation 

16 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


that’ s one dimensional.  Each of these alternatives is feasible and amply rewards 
further attention. 

Suppose that the shape 

is the nine points Evans uses to define line segments as constituents 

and that the embedding relation is unchanged: it continues to require identity 
among  constituents.  I  really  don ’ t  have  too much  choice.  There ’ s  no  other 
way  to  do  embedding  for  points.  (To  be  exact,  I ’m  going  to  calculate with 
shapes in the algebra U0 2.) 

I can use the rule 

Three points → Triangle 

in place of Evans ’ s rule to define 45° right triangles 

Or equivalently, I can give the rule in this identity 

�� 

in the way I normally do, where two shapes — in this case, they’re the same — 
are separated by an arrow.  I ’ll say more about rules  like  this a  little  later on 
when I look at embedding for lines.  My new rule in whatever form finds 28 
different triangles in the shape 

17 


G. STINY


including the 16 from Evans ’ s example.  But there are 48 other triangles in the 
shape in five different constellations 

��

��

�

� 

� 

These are readily defined in additional rules.  (Of course, it ’ s easy to define all 
triangles using a single rule in the way Evans does, or as effortlessly, using a 
schema for rules in my way.  This is also something I ’ll come back to again.)  I 
can’ t find any other triangles.  My grammar is seeing what I do. 

Now what happens when  I erase points or  look  for Y ’ s?  In  the  first 
case, my rule is just like it was before, but for points 

Point → 

Or equivalently 

�� 

When  I  apply  the  rule  to  erase  the  vertices  of  Evans ’ s  small  triangles,  the 
shape disappears the way it should.  And if I do the same for medium triangles 
and for large ones, then I get the shapes 

Everything looks fine, even if the Greek cross appears in alternative ways.  In 
fact, this may be an advantage.  I can decide whether I ’ve erased the vertices 
of medium triangles or large ones simply by looking.  There’ s nothing to see 
that I can’ t understand.  Points aren’ t like lines.  They don’ t fill in for the loss 
of others because they don ’ t combine to make other points and don ’ t contain 

18 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


them.  The  grammar  I ’ve  got  for  points  is  doing  a  lot  better  than  Evans ’ s 
grammar for lines.  Visual calculating may be a real possibility after all. 

But what about Y ’ s 

with equilateral arms that are defined in this rule 

Four points → Y 

or with the identity 

�� 

There ’ s  no  problem.  I  can ’ t  see  the Y  anywhere  in my  shape.  It ’ s  possible 
there are other kinds of Y ’ s — I can define additional rules to find them — but 
their arms are different lengths 

Calculating and seeing match again.  This time with uncanny precision. 

So here I am with the shape 

that ’ s just what calculating tells me it is.  Nothing is hidden.  Anything a rule 
can  find,  I  can  see.  And  what  I  see  depends  on  the  rule  I  apply.  There ’ s 
nothing to see that a rule can ’ t find.  This is just what I had in mind for visual 
calculating. But my example isn ’ t completely convincing.  Everything works 
because  the  shape  contains points  —  lowest  level  constituents  again  —  that 

19 


G. STINY


don’ t interact.  They’re independent in combination: embedding means identity . 
The whole  thing  is  a  strictly  combinatorial  affair  —  points  are  like marbles 
ready to count — and seeing is simply a matter of combining and rearranging 
them in alternative ways.  Surely, there ’ s more to seeing than counting.  To see 
what it is, I have to go back to lines and change the embedding relation somehow, 
so that it’ s not merely identity. 

Suppose I keep Evans ’ s shape the same 

I can draw it with eight lines — its maximal elements — the way an experienced 
draftsman would  —  only  four  of  Evans’
s  triangles  are  explicitly  defined  — 
but I ’m not obliged to treat these lines as constituents.  The parts of the shape 
may  be  combinations  of  maximal  elements,  or  including  everything  I  can, 
combinations of elements or their segments.  Now there are indefinitely many 
parts, and none is preferred to any other.  This is in fact the potential infinite of 
Aristotle  — I ’m free to divide the shape wherever I like  — and not an actual 
infinite of parts that have been collected together.  The parts I see — the limited 
number I resolve when I divide the shape — depend on the rules I ’ve got and 
how  I  use  them.  I  need  to  have  an  embedding  relation  for  this  that’ s  one 
dimensional and works for lines. 

Let ’ s agree that a line l is embedded in any other line l’  if l and l’  are 
identical or  — going beyond embedding for points  — l is a segment of l’ 

� 
�� 

� 

�� 

� 
�� 

More generally, a shape M is part of any shape S if the maximal elements of M 
are  embedded  in  maximal  elements  of  S.  (I  was  drawn  to  this  relation  by 
necessity. When I started using a typewriter — I was eleven or so — I contrived 
an easy way to check my work against an original or if I had to retype a page to 
correct mistakes and not make more.  Proofreading was hard.  It took too long 
and was unreliable.  So I ’d embed one page in another .  I ’d tape the first to a 
window  and move my  copy  over  it.  I  could  see what was  on  both  pages  at 
once.  If things that were supposed to be the same lined up — at least piecewise 
— then I knew my typing was all right.  Creative designers use yellow tracing 
paper in like ways whether or not they apply rules.)  Whatever I can see in S — 

20 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL 

anything I can trace — is one of its parts.  This leads straight to calculating in 
the algebras of shapes Ui j, and is almost exactly what James has in mind when 
he describes  how reasoning works.  For the rule M → P and the shape S, if I 
can  see M  in S,  then  I  can  replace  it with  another  shape P by  subtracting M 
from S and adding P.  I’ll add by drawing shapes together , so that their maximal 
elements fuse.  And I ’ll subtract by adding shapes and then erasing one, so that 
segments  of  maximal  elements  are  removed.  Remarkably,  the  embedding 
relation implies nearly everything I need in order to do all of this with axiomatic 
prec is ion .   I   a lso   need   transforma t ions   of   some   k ind   to   comp le te   the  
correspondence  between  M  and  P,  and  S.  But  I ’ll  skip  the  details  because 
they ’re  not  hard  to  fill  in,  even  if  they ’re  not  without  many  important 
consequences.  (Now I ’m ready to calculate in the algebra U 1 2 instead of the 
algebra U0 2.  And I’ll do everything in U 1 2 from now on.) 

With lines and this embedding relation, Evans’ s rule to define triangles 
is simply the identity 

�� 

I don ’ t have to say what a triangle is in terms of constituents that are already 
given.  I only have to draw it.  It makes no sense to have the rule 

Three lines → Triangle 

because  I  don ’ t  know  how  the  sides  of  triangles  are  divided  —  remember
there ’ s no telling how many lines there are in a shape  — or even if sides are 
parts.  And I don ’ t have to divide Evans ’ s shape into constituents either for the 
identity to apply in the way I want to find every triangle.  The shape is OK as 
a drawing, too 

, 

When I use the identity,  there are 16 triangles — this is just what I see — even 
though the small triangles and the medium ones have maximal elements that 
aren ’ t maximal elements in the shape.  My erasing rule  — the one I added to 
Evans ’ s grammar — is 
�� 

21 


G. STINY


and it produces the results I get if I erase the lines I see by hand.  If I apply the 
rule to the sides of small triangles, the shape disappears.  And when I use it to 
take away the sides of medium or large triangles, I get the Greek cross 

This is the way it’ s supposed to work — seeing and calculating agree perfectly . 
When I see a part and change it according to a rule, there ’ s nothing hidden to 
confuse the result.  Whatever distinctions a rule makes, I can see.  There may 
be surprises — there are plenty to come — but they aren’
t artificial ones caused 
because I’ve misrepresented shapes with constituents that I can’
t redefine after 
I ’ve started to calculate.  There ’ s no underlying analysis that determines what 
I can see and what I can do.  Whatever is surprising is perceptual.  It ’ s a natural 
part of sensible experience.  And the rule 

�� 

—  another  identity  —  finds  as  many 
Y ’ s  in  the  shape  as  there  are  to  see. 
Seeing is never disappointed.  There ’ s no part I can see that a rule can ’ t find. 
Novelty is always possible.  What you see is what you get. 

It may be useful to stop briefly to compare Evan’ s example for points 
and for lines.  For points, there are finitely many parts for rules to find, but for 
l ines ,   there   are   indef in i te ly   many   par ts .   Th is   is   ev iden t   for   Y ’ s ,   and  
fundamentally so for the rules 
�� 

��

While  the one can only be used a  limited number of  times,  the other ’ s work 
may  never  be  done.  A  point  —  just  like  a  constituent  —  can  be  erased  in 
exactly one way.  I can ’ t remove some of it now and some of it later.  It goes all 
at once.  It ’ s there or it ’ s not.  But I can divide a line wherever I like.  I can take 
any   p iece   now   and   ano ther   p iece   la ter.  I ts   segmen ts   prov ide   end less  
possibilities.  Points and lines just aren’ t the same with their distinct dimensions 
and  their  corresponding  embedding  relations.  If  I  confuse  them  in  order  to 
calculate, then I’m simply not calculating visually . 

22 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


But there ’ s a lot more.  What about the constituents of the shape 

How do these change as I calculate, and how are they finally defined?  This is 
Evans ’ s problem in reverse.  He has to divide the shape before calculating, so 
that his  rule  can  find  all of  the  triangles  there  are  to  see.  This  analysis  isn ’ t 
part of calculating.  It ’ s more important.  It ’ s what makes calculating possible. 
I’d like  to know how to define constituents, but Evans doesn’ t say.  He probably 
doesn’ t think about it.  It’ s just something you do when you’re going to calculate. 
Even if it’ s obvious, I’d like to see what’ s involved.  And it may not be obvious. 
Evans gives 24 constituents when 22 will do.  So I ’ll take a dif ferent tack and 
show how to define constituents as part of calculating.  I ’m not stuck the way 
Evans  is.  I  can  look  at  everything  —  including  analysis  —  as  the  result  of 
applying rules.  This is what I said visual calculating should do. 

Let ’ s start with something easy.  I want to use the rule 

�� 

to calculate, so that constituents are defined dynamically again and again in an 
ongoing  process.  The  rule  is  an  identity:  it  simply  tells  me  a  triangle  is  a 
triangle  without  referring  to  its  sides  —  Evans’
s  definition  —  or  any  other 
parts.  I  can ’ t  say  anything  about  a  shape  in  a  rule  —  identity or not  —  that 
goes much further than pointing to it and announcing that it’ s that.  I can name 
it — a triangle is a triangle — but there’
s nothing definite about its parts.  I’ll 
say more  about  this  and  what  it means  for  visual  calculating  and  reasoning 
itself as soon as I get to schemas for rules.  Right now, though, I only have my 
identity for triangles.  What good is it to know that a triangle is a triangle? 

Identities are interesting rules.  Rules are supposed to change things, 
but identities don ’ t.  Whenever they ’re used to calculate — let ’
s apply one or 
more to a shape S a number of times — the result is a monotonous series that 
looks like this 

S ⇒ S ⇒ . . . ⇒ S 

In each step (S ⇒ S), another part of S is resolved  — that ’

s the part I see  — 

23 


G. STINY


and then nothing else happens.  The shape doesn ’ t change.  It stays the same. 
At  least  that’ s  how  it  looks.  Identities  are  constructively  worthless.  They 
have no use.  And it ’ s standard practice to discard them.  But this may be rash. 
It misses what they really do.  There’ s far more to identities than idle repetition. 
Identities are observational devices.  They ’re all I need to divide the shape S 
with respect to what I see.  If I record the parts they pick out as they ’re tried, 
then  I  can  define  topologies  for  S  that  show  its  constituents  and  how  they 
change as I calculate. 

Suppose I apply the identity 

�� 

to the shape 

so  that  large  triangles are picked out  in a clockwise  fashion  in  this  four  step 
series 

� 

� 

� 

� 

If I take the triangles the identity resolves — remember
, these are the triangles 
I  see  —  I  can  use  them  to  define  constituents. 
I ’m  going  to  calculate  some 
more to explain how I ’ve been calculating.  There are a number of ways to do 
this.  For example, I can work out sums and products, or I can add complements 
as well.  Complements give Boolean algebras for the shape.  They ’re a special 
kind of topology with atoms that provide a neat inventory of constituents. 

The first time I apply the identity to calculate, I get a Boolean algebra 
with two atoms 

24 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL 

I  see  a  triangle  and  it ’ s  complement.  It may be  a  little  farfetched  to  assume 
that I see the shape 

— I have a hard time making sense of it  — but complements are sometimes 
like this.  They’re surely worth the added ef fort, though, because they simplify 
things as I go on.  There are four atoms when I apply the identity the second 
time 

Now I see a pair of triangles and their complements that combine in products 
to define constituents.  And there are seven atoms the third and fourth times I 
use the identity 

including the six individual sides of the large triangles and the interior Greek 
cross.  This is all pretty good.  The constituents I finally get match my visual 
expectations.  The sides of  the  triangles  interact, while  the Greek cross  is an 
independent figure. 

Of course, there are also medium and small triangles in the shape 

25 


G. STINY


And I can apply the identity 

�� 

to  find  these  triangles  in  exactly  the  same  way.  Medium  triangles  —  if  I 
resolve all of them  — define nine constituents 

and small triangles  — again, if I resolve all of them  — define 16 

The  atoms  I  get  for  the  small  triangles  —  the  half  lines  in  Evans’
example  — are the most refined constituents I can define, no matter how the 
identity  is  used  to  pick  out  triangles.  All  of  the  large  triangles  in  the  shape 

s 

26 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL 

contain six constituents, all of the medium triangles are made up of four, and 
all of the small triangles are made up of three 

But this doesn ’ t mean — as it did in Evans ’
s example — that triangles have to 
be  described  (represented)  in  different  ways  for  the  identity  to  work  as  it ’ s 
meant to.  For the identity 

�� 

the embedding relation  is given for  lines, so  that  they can fuse and divide  in 
any way whatsoever, but for Evans ’ s rule 

Three lines → Triangle 

embedding requires that constituents — they neither fuse nor divide — match 
in  an  exact  correspondence,  as  elements  do  in  sets.  Perhaps  this  is  another 
way of seeing it.  A shape  — at least with lines  — is not a set. 

The identity applies to shapes, not to their descriptions.  As far as the 
identity is concerned, a triangle is whatever I draw.  It ’ s simply this 

with no divisions of any kind: no sides, no angles, and no anything else.  And 
it ’ s always there to see if it can be embedded.  Evans gets into trouble because 
of  the  way  he  calculates.  He  confuses  a  triangle  —  something  sensible  — 
with a solitary description — an abstract definition — that ’
s only one of many. 
This is the kind of thing that can happen if my formula dim(el) = dim(em) isn’ t 
satisfied, and in particular, if the embedding relation is zero dimensional and 
elements  aren ’ t.  Shapes  and  descriptions  are  different  sorts  of  things.  But 
more   impor tan t ,   I   can   ca lcu la te   w i th   shapes   w i thou t   referr ing   to   the ir  
descriptions. This idea provides another way to think about visual calculating. 
But first, let ’ s look at an example that shows a little more of what ’ s at stake.  It 
begins to fill in the picture for rules that aren’ t identities. 

27 


G. STINY


A second look at calculating 

I’m positive that some of you have already seen the following example. 
Nevertheless, I ’m going  to show  it again.  Seeing something for a second or 
third  time with  altered  emphasis may bring  increased  insight.  After  all,  I’m 
dealing with shapes.  And I want you  to see how shapes are redescribed as I 
calculate.  There ’ s  no  given way  to  see  shapes  that  rules  can ’ t  change when 
they’re tried.  The ability to handle ongoing changes like this — there’
s always 
going to be a chance for more, even with only a single rule  — is what makes 
calculating visual. 

The rule 

�� 

rotates an equilateral triangle about its center, so that this point is permanently 
fixed.  I can apply the rule eight times to define the shapes in this series 

It ’ s easy to see that the final shape in the series is a rotation of the initial shape 
about its center.  So far, so good.  But If you think about it, this simply can ’ t be 
right.  The centers of  the  triangles  in  the  initial shape change position as  the 
initial shape is rotated 

The rule doesn ’ t move the centers of triangles, but they move anyhow.  What ’ s 
going on?  How did this happen?  It’ s more than a surprise.  It’ s a new kind of 
paradox.  (Often when I describe the series, I ’m accused of faking the rotation. 
An MIT engineering professor thought so — his colleague lost his head fixing 
a translation device  — and others have, too.  What fun!) 

The answer is something to see.  The rule can be applied to the fourth 
shape in the series in alternative ways.  In one way, the rule picks out the three 
triangles that correspond to the three triangles in the initial shape.  But none of 
these triangles is resolved in the other way.  Instead, the rule divides the fourth 
shape into two triangles — the lar ge outside triangle and the small inside one 
— that have sides formed from sides of the three triangles that come from the 

28 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL 

ones  in  the  initial shape.  The rule rotates  the  two  triangles  in  turn  to get  the 
Now the rule can be applied in alternative ways to the 
fifth and sixth shapes. 
Either  the  rule  resolves  both  of  the  triangles  that

correspond to the ones in the fourth shape, or the three triangles — one at each 
corner of the sixth shape — that have sides formed from segments of sides of 
the  triangles  in  this  pair.  The  rule  rotates  the  three  corner  triangles  one  at  a 
time to reach the final shape. 

Twice in this process, the rule changes what I see in a surprising way. 
Whenever lines are combined, they fuse, so that all prior divisions disappear. 
I can always redefine triangles — 
Then new divisions are possible anywhere. 
and so redescribe the shape — according to how I apply the rule.  The way the 
rule works makes this feasible as I’m calculating, without outside intervention. 
I’m embedding triangles to determine parts — tracing them out — not matching 
predefined constituents.  The rule applies neither locally — as it appears to at 
ferent ways later on — but anywhere 
first — nor globally — as it appears to in dif

s  not  done with  the  same  rules  given  to 
calculate.  When I calculate, there ’ s no reason to appeal to anything more than 
rules.) 

The nine shapes in the series 

are all made up of triangles.  Their numbers summarize the action of the rule 
as it ’ s applied from step to step. 
Look at the following three series 

��������������������������������� 
��������������������������������� 
��������������������������������� 

The first series shows the maximum number of triangles — these can be picked 
out using an identity — in each of the shapes.  The next series gives the number 
of triangles in a shape after the rule has been applied, and the last series gives 
In both of these 
the number of triangles in a shape as the rule is being applied. 

29 


G. STINY 

cases, the number of triangles depends on what the rule does either by rotating 
an existing triangle or seeing a new one to rotate, and then counting in terms of 
the  triangle  and  its  complement.  The  resulting  inconsistencies  in  the  fourth 
and sixth shapes tell the story.  There ’ s no saying how many triangles there are 
until the rule is applied.  There are triangles in both shapes — no one doubts it 
—  but  they ’re  not  numerically  distinct. 
Counting  goes  awry:  two  triangles 
just can’ t be  three, and neither number  is five.  (It’ s only blind  luck  that  two 
and  three make  five.  In many  cases,  there ’ s  no  easy  relationship  like  this.) 
The process looks discontinuous — there ’
s a saltation: three triangles are two 
and two are three — but it’
s not.  Shapes can always be described in alternative 
ways, and welcome different descriptions  indifferently.  The parts  I see may 
alter erratically either in number or by kind at anytime. 

I can describe the shapes in the series as topologies, so that the rotation 
from  the  initial shape  to  the final shape  is continuous.  This also shows how 
the  shapes  are  divided  into  constituents  as  a  result  of  applying  the  rule  to 
calculate.  In  particular,  there  are  Boolean  algebras  for  the  shapes  with  the 
atoms given in Table 2.

The atoms are defined retrospectively.  To quote Kierkegaard  — via 
James  —  ‘W e  live  [calculate]  forwards,  but  we  understand  backwards. ’
  I 
begin with the final shape and then work back to the initial shape.  The final 
shape has no noticeable structure.  It ’ s an atom itself as it ’ s not divided by the 
rule.  But  each  preceding  shape  has  the  triangle  resolved  by  the  rule  as  an 
atom, and other atoms to form its complement and to ensure continuity going 
forward. 

Th is   p robab ly   sounds   a   l i t t le   obscu re   —   I   know   I   men t ioned  
Kierkegaard  —  but  really  I ’m  simply  calculating  again  to  explain  how  I ’ve 
been calculating.  And the idea is clear once it ’ s tried.  Its value as an account 
of how I calculate is easy to see if I record the divisions in the triangle in the 
right side of the rule 

�� 

formed with respect to constituents (atoms) in Table 2.  The triangle is divided 
in alternative ways in the eight steps of the series 

The parts defined in the triangle combine sequentially to build up the different 
triangles that the rule picks out in its subsequent applications.  The pieces 

from the first three triangles combine in this way 

and the remaining sides 

combine in this way 

31

to define constituents of the second and third shapes in the series, and at last 
the large outside triangle and the small inside one in the fourth shape.  And the 
pieces  in  the  fourth  and  fifth  triangles  combine  in  like  fashion  to  make  the 
three triangles in the sixth shape that are needed for the production of the final 
shape.  Looking forward, the constituents of the shapes in the series anticipate 
what the rule is going to do the next time it ’ s applied.  But this isn ’ t divination. 
It happens because constituents are only given as an afterthought.  Whenever 
calculating  stops,  I  can  describe  what ’ s  gone  on  as  a  continuous  process  in 
which shapes are assembled piece by piece in an orderly way.  This makes a 
good  story and a good explanation.  It’ s  the kind of  retrospective narrative  I 
hear all of the time from people doing creative work. 

Every time the rule 
�� 

is tried, its right side is divided with respect to different constituents.  The way 
I describe what I ’m doing changes as I calculate  — it ’
s merely an artifact of 
what I ’m trying for the time being — so I can always go on and calculate some 
more.  Nothing  prevents me  from  seeing  things  again.  I ’m  free  to  fuse  old 
divisions and make new ones. 

How descriptions of shapes change is highlighted in another way when 
I use schemas to define rules.  A rule schema 

x → y 

is a pair of variables x and y that take shapes as values.  These are given in an 
assignment g that satisfies a predicate.  Whenever g is used, a rule 

g(x) → g(y) 

is defined.  The rule then applies as usual, as if it were given explicitly from 
the start.  This works to express a host of intuitive ideas about shapes and how 
to change them. 

Schemas can be very general.  In fact, I can give one for all rules.  I 
only have  to  say  that x  and y  are  shapes.  But usually  schemas have  a more 
refined purpose.  Here ’ s a rule 

32 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


�� 

defined in a schema x → y that produces the shape 

and others of the same kind formed when polygons are inscribed in polygons. 
An assignment g gives values to the variables x and y that fulfill this predicate: 

x is a polygon with n sides, and y = x + z, where z is a polygon 
with n sides inscribed in x. 

The predicate can be elaborated in much greater detail — for example, I could 
say something more about polygons being convex, etc. and then go on to say 
that the vertices of z are points on the sides of x, etc. — but this isn ’
t necessary 
to see how schemas work.  It ’ s enough to have the two variables x and y, and 
the assignment g. 

It ’ s interesting to note also that the schema produces shapes that can 
be used in examples like the one above in which the shape 

is rotated by rotating individual triangles.  (The different things that can happen 
vary with  the Fibonacci number determined by  the number of polygons  that 
are  inscribed one  in another.)  This shows,  too,  that my predicate  is far from 
unique.  In fact, it’ s true for any predicate — and in particular
, for any predicate 
for  shapes  with  basic  elements  of  dimension  one  or  more  —  that  there  are 
indefinitely many others equivalent to it. 

The specific alternative I have in mind should be obvious.  I can change 
the predicate, so that y is n triangles rather than two polygons.  This determines 
exactly the same rules, but with some interesting twists.  In this series of shapes

G. STINY 

I use the schema to change a quadrilateral after applying the schema to replace 
a quadrilateral with  triangles.  I go  from  four  triangles  to a quadrilateral and 
four  smaller  triangles  by  changing  a  quadrilateral  that ’ s  inscribed  in  a 
quadrilateral.  Where did the quadrilaterals come from?  I thought I had four 
triangles.  I said  it before.  The parts I see aren ’ t fixed.  They may change at 
anytime in number or by kind.  How I describe a rule and the shape to which it 
applies needn ’ t agree.  I can fool around with descriptions as long as I like, to 
get the results I want in a  sensible way.  Rules apply to shapes and not to their 
descriptions. 

This sounds all wrong.  How can calculating be so confused?  Definite 
descriptions define  the  shapes  in  a  rule g(x) → g(y).  But  the description of 
g(x) may be  incompatible with  the description I have for  the shape  to which 
the rule applies.  It ’ s just not calculating if these descriptions don ’ t match.  But 
what  law  says  that  shapes must  be  described  consistently  to  calculate.  The 
shape  g(x) may  have  indefinitely many  descriptions  besides  the  description 
that defines it.  But none of these descriptions is final.  The embedding relation 
works for parts of shapes  — not for descriptions of shapes  — when I try the 
rule.  My account of how  I calculate may use as many descriptions as  I  like 
that jump from here to there erratically.  It may sound nuts or irrational while 
I’m  doing  it.  But whether  or  not  there’ s  a  favorable  conclusion with  useful 
results  doesn ’ t  depend  on  this.  I  can  always  tidy  up  after  I ’ve  finished 
calculating,  so  that  I  have  a  retrospective  explanation  that ’ s  consistent. 
Rationality is a sentiment to end with. 

So  when  is  calculating  visual?  I  have  another  answer  that  may  be 
better than my formula dim(el) = dim(em). 

Calculating is visual when descriptions don ’ t count. 

Descriptions aren’ t binding.  There’ s no reason to stick with any of them that’ s 
not  just  prejudice.  I’m  happy  with  this,  but  I’m  not  sure  everyone  will  be 
happy with what it does to reasoning.  I use rules to calculate, but I don ’ t have 
to play by them.  I can cheat.  And I can get away with it.  I ’m totally free to 
change my mind about what there is, and I ’m free to act on it.  (Children play 
games in this way, unless we intervene and make them follow the rules.  Only 
suppose they already do.)  There are no definitions to conform to, and there’ s 
no  vocabulary  to  build  from.  Constituents,  atoms,  components,  primitives, 
units, and the rest are merely afterthoughts.  But is this going too far?  What 
makes me think I ’m calculating?  And if I ’m not, what ’ s reasoning all about? 
Visual calculating is crazy. 

34 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL 

What’ s that or how many? 

I confess.  I really don ’ t know what reasoning is, and I ’m not totally 
sure  about  calculating.  I  don ’ t  think  James  would  have  any  problem  with 
what I ’ve been saying, either as calculating or as reasoning.  But others may 
demur for one reason or another.  Not everyone is ready and willing to allow 
as much as James — to encourage dif
ferent points of view and to welcome the 
novelty they bring — when there’
s thinking to do.  There’ s always a right way 
and a wrong way, no doubt about it. 

All ways of conceiving a concrete fact, if they are true ways at all, 
are equally true ways.  There is no property ABSOLUTELY essential 
to any one thing.  The same property which figures as the essence of 
a  thing  on  one  occasion  becomes  a  very  inessential  feature  upon 
another. 

Meanwhile the reality overflows these purposes at every pore. 

.  .  .  the only meaning of  essence  is  teleological  .  .  .  classification 
and conception are purely teleological weapons of the mind. 

The properties which are important vary from man to man and from 
hour to hour. 

Reasoning is always for a subjective interest, to attain some particular 
conclusion, or to gratify some special curiosity.  It not only breaks 
up  the  datum  placed  before  it  and  conceives  it  abstractly;  it must 
conceive it rightly too; and conceiving it rightly means conceiving it 
by that one particular abstract character which leads to the one sort 
of conclusion which it is the reasoner ’ s temporary interest to attain. 

I may change occasions more rapidly than James expects moving freely among 
parts  whether  they ’re  details  or  overall  features. 
I  change  occasions  every 
time I apply a rule M → P to calculate: when I embed M and infer (introduce) 
P.  And I string all of these occasions together in an ongoing series to produce 
useful  but  not  necessarily  logical  (consistent)  results.  Nothing  says  my 
temporary  interests  aren’ t  evanescent  and  arbitrarily  linked.  I  think  this  is 
why  visual  calculating  and  reasoning  can  be  a  lot more  effective  in  practice 
than calculating and reasoning in some other way.  Their appeal to seeing  — 
to sensible concrete experience — puts the ability to deal with novelty — ‘the 
technical differentia of reasoning’   — at the center of creative activity . 

35 


G. STINY


Some other famous thinkers, however, aren’ t so sure that my kind of 
calculating  with  shapes  —  where  rules  automatically  redefine  parts  as  they 
apply — is really calculating.  Ludwig Wittgenstein notices that numbers and 
shapes don ’ t add up in the same way  — there ’
s a distinct difference between 
calculating  and  visual  calculating  —  and  he  suggests  his  observation  shows 
how  ‘mathematics is normative’. 

An addition of shapes together, so that some of the edges 
fuse, plays a very small part in our life. —  As when 

and 

yield the figure 

But  if  this  were  an  important  operation,  our  ordinary  concept  of 
arithmetical addition would perhaps be different. 

Let us imagine that while we were calculating the figures 
on  paper  altered  erratically.  A  1 would  suddenly  become  a  6  and 
then a 5 and then again a 1 and so on.  And I want to assume that this 
does not make any difference to the calculation because, as soon as 
I read a figure in order to calculate with it or to apply it, it once more 
becomes the one that we have in our calculating.  At the same time, 
however, one can see quite well how the figures change during the 
calculations; but we are trained not to worry about this. 
Of course, even if we do not make the above assumption, 
this calculation could lead to usable results. 
Here we calculate strictly according to rules, yet this result 
does not have to come out.  — I am assuming that we see no sort of 
regularity in the alteration of figures. 

Now you might of course say: “In this case the manipulation 
of figures according to rules is not calculation. ” 

Wittgenstein’ s curious manipulations in which figures alter erratically 
of their own accord and calculating with shapes have a common look and feel. 
It’ s uncanny. And just as the one may skirt the comfortable norms of calculating, 
so  too  may  the  other.  Of  course,  norms  may  be  effective  or  not.  At  first, 
Wittgenstein is tempted to limit what can change and simply go on with business 

36 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


as usual.  He ’ s surprisingly explicit about this. 

And I want to assume that this does not make any difference to the 
calculation because, as soon as I read a figure in order to calculate 
with it or to apply it, it once more becomes the one that we have in 
our calculating. 

Wittgenstein ’ s instinctive response is conservative.  He keeps to the law that 
keeps  everything  the  same,  the  same  as  the  rest  of  us.  I  count  on  figures  to 
behave themselves when I use them to calculate.  This comes from training. 
(There  are  the  basics  —  predefined  constituents  and  their  combinations  — 
tough standards, and tests to make sure that schools and students are accountable 
for  teaching  and  learning.  How  basic  are  basics  that  have  to  be  taught  and 
tested?  The  need  for  standards  is  to  exclude  anything  different.  They  limit 
present experience to what seemed to work in the past. Any prospect of novelty 
is gone.  There are no surprises.  Nothing is ambiguous or vague.  This is the 
end of anxiety and uncertainty, and makes  it unnecessary  to  trust others and 
give  them a chance.  But  is  it a  sensible way  to educate people  to  recognize 
and  exploit  new  opportunities?  What  good  are  my  rules  now?  Of  course, 
training  needn’ t  limit  experience.  It may  be  open-ended  —  for  example,  in 
studio  instruction  and  situated  learning.  In  the  latter, master  and  apprentice 
interact during actual practice.  They work on the same thing without having 
to  see  it  in  the  same  way.  There’ s  no  underlying  structure  controlling  the 
process:  ‘structure  is more  the variable outcome of  action  than  it ’ s  invariant 
precondition.’  This is like visual calculating.)  Yet rigorous training may not 
be necessary for a successful (creative or novel) conclusion when I calculate: 

. . . even if we do not make the above assumption, this calculation 
could lead to usable results. 

Ignoring ‘the above assumption’
 is what visual calculating is all about.  Whether 
or not you think it’ s real calculating doesn’ t really matter.  But the ambiguity 
cuts in opposing ways: once to explain why greater attention hasn’ t been focused 
on visual calculating as a useful alternative to calculating with numbers — the 
one isn ’ t calculating — and then again to explain why it ’
s so easy to think that 
visual calculating is necessarily the same as calculating in the ordinary way.  I 
like to calculate by seeing.  But whenever I try, either no one believes it or they 
think  I’m  doing  something  else.  Perhaps  I’m  just wasting my  time when  it 
comes to visual calculating.  Only what else can I do if I want to see how far 
reasoning goes.  There ’ s always something else to see. 

37 


G. STINY 

I haven ’ t clarified anything yet.  Calculating and reasoning  — visual 
or not — appear no better of
f than shapes.  They’re just as vague and ambiguous. 
But others have thought about this, and draw distinctions in many alternative 
ways.  Everybody  knows  that  Marvin  Minsky  —  Evans  was  his  student  at 
MIT  —  thinks  calculating  and  reasoning  are  the  same  thing.  What  he  says 
about creativity is telling. 

What is creativity?  How do people get new ideas?  Most 
thinkers would  agree  that  some of  the  secret  lies  in  finding  “new 
ways to look at things.”  We’ve just seen how to use the Body-Support 
concept to reformulate descriptions of some spatial forms . . . let ’ s 
look more carefully at how we made those four different arches seem 
the same, by making each of them seem to match “a thing supported 
by two legs. ” 
In the case of Single-Arch, we did this by imagining 
some  boundaries  that  weren ’ t  really  there:  this  served  to  break  a 
single object into three. 

���� 
�  ����������������������������������� 
�������

However,  we  dealt  with  Tower-Arch  by  doing  quite  the 
opposite: we  treated  some  real  boundaries  as  though  they  did  not 
exist:

���� 
�����������������������������������

How cavalier a way to treat the world, to see three different 
things as one and to represent one thing as three! 

Minsky echoes James with a neat example.  In fact for James, ‘Genius, 
in truth, means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an unhabitual way.’ 
Yes,  Minsky  welcomes  alternative  descriptions  and  knows  just  how  daring 
(cavalier)  an  idea  this  is.  But  he  may  be  uneasy  about  it.  Elsewhere,  he ’ s 
ready to apply ‘radically dif ferent kinds of analysis to the same situation ’  and 
is convinced that Thomas Kuhn ’ s paradigm switches occur again and again in 
everyday thought.  This still sounds a lot like James.  Only Minsky shies and 
retreats to the security of constituents and combinations.  He splits thinking in 
two: an initial analysis of ‘elements’ — how is this done? — and an independent 
heuristic  search  in  which  ‘elements  are  combined  in  dif ferent  ways  until  a 
configuration is reached that passes some sort of test. ’  This is how computer 
models are supposed to work, and it’ s not too far off the dull sort of education 

38 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


I just described.  How useful is analysis before search begins?  What happens 
when rules apply to shapes?  There ’ s a paradigm (gestalt) switch every time a 
rule is tried.  The elements of analysis aren’ t given beforehand but change as 
calculating goes on.  Minsky ’ s arches support this.  They furnish the standard 
that shows what it means to be static, and much more.  The statics of arches — 
‘the Body-Support concept ’
  — works consistently in dif
ferent cases because 
arches aren ’ t static.  Shapes are never static.  They ’re unstable.  They fuse in 
comb in a t ion ,   so   th a t   n ew   d iv i s ion s   a r e   a lw ay s   po s s ib l e .   E l em en t s ,  
configurations,  and  tests  aren’ t  the way  to  deal with  this  kind  of  ambiguity. 
How well does Evans ’ s grammar work?  There ’ s an initial analysis to define 
constituents  followed  by  a  search  in which  a  heuristic  —  try  configurations 
with three lines  — and a test  — is it a polygon?  — are involved. 
Everything 
is askew if lines are taken for points that can be counted.  Heuristic search is 
senseless once analysis  — seeing  — stops. 

Minsky  starts  out  in  the  right  direction  only  to  make  a  wrong  turn. 
He’ s lost.  He’ s sure quantitative models of reasoning are inadequate.  This is 
fine.  Visual  calculating  —  everybody  knows  it ’
s  qualitative  —  may  be  an 
alternative worth searching for.  Yet Minsky ’ s reason to find something new is 
baffling.  A number-like magnitude ‘is too structureless and uninformative to 
permit  further  analysis  .  .  .  A  number  cannot  reflect  the  considerations  that 
formed it. ’  OK, but this is also true for shapes.  It lets me divide them freely 
when I apply rules.  The opposite assumes a law of conservation —  Wittgenstein 
shows this — to uphold decisions I’ve made in the past, to recognize (remember) 
what  I  did  before  and  act  on  it  heedless  of  anything  else  that may  come  up. 
(Memory isn’ t something to forget when buying a computer or thinking about 
thinking.  Plato considers memory a good source of ideas.  Suppose I have a 
computer with the memory to store all of the information I might ever use — 
important facts and right definitions of things like triangles.  Would it help me 
think?  It may take care of learning — there ’
s no reason not to be optimistic — 
but there ’ s still sagacity — raw creativity .  Who wants to visit www.plato.edu 
or  invest  in  one  of  its  .com  counterparts?)  This  looks  away  from  visual 
calculating  to  calculating  in  the way we ’ve been  trained. 
I ’m  stuck.  Visual 
calculating isn’ t calculating or it’ s misunderstood. 

The idea that I can change how I describe things when I apply rules is 
at  the  heart  of  visual  calculating,  but  it  seems  it ’ s  an  idea  that ’ s  not  easy  to 
accept or to use.  And in fact, it would be easy to dismiss if it only had roots in 
sensible experience that ’ s superficial and without any deep structure.  Art and 
such  are  important,  but  science  is what  really  counts.  It ’ s  lucky  that  things 

39 


G. STINY 

aren ’ t always how they appear at first.  It ’ s an idea strongly rooted in science 
as well.  Hilary Putnam tells the story. 

Since the end of the nineteenth century science itself has begun to 
take  on  a  ‘non-classical ’  —  that  is,  a  non-seventeenth-century-
appearance.  [Earlier]  I  described  the  phenomenon  of  conceptual 
relativity — one which has simple illustrations, like [mine for a few 
individuals],  but  which  has  become  pervasive  in  contemporary 
science.  That there are ways of describing what are (in some way) 
the  ‘same facts ’ which are (in some way)  ‘equivalent ’ but also (in 
some way) ‘incompatible’ is a strikingly non-classical phenomenon. 
Ye t   con temporary   log ic ians   and   mean ing   theor is ts   genera l ly  
philosophize as if it did not exist. 

This contains a good description of the shapes in the series 

that are produced when I use the rule 

�� 

to calculate.  In particular, the fourth shape and the sixth shape are equivalent 
— they’re congruent  — but are incompatible with respect to their parts. 
The 
fourth shape is two nested triangles: that ’ s how I get to the sixth shape.  And 
the  sixth  shape  is  three  corner  triangles:  that ’ s  how  I  get  to  the  final  shape. 
Indeed, this  is a striking way to calculate.  That it ’ s outside of the interests of 
logic is no big surprise.  I said at the beginning that I wasn’ t too fond of logic 
and would  try  to  avoid  it.  This  only  settles my  decision.  Others who  have 
thought  about  visual  reasoning  —  for  instance,  Susanne  Langer  —  look  at 
logic  in  roughly  the  same  way.  (Langer  distinguishes  ‘presentational ’
  and 
‘discursive ’
  forms.  The  one  deals with  sensible  experience, while  the  other 
sticks  with  units  (constituents)  and  their  combinations.)  But  Putnam  isn ’ t 
worried  about  what  logicians  ignore.  He  wants  to  make  sense  of  this  non-
classical phenomenon.  And what he says resonates with what I ’ve been trying 
to say about visual calculating. 

Pu tnam   makes   two   impo r tan t   po in ts .   One   wo rks   w i th   v isua l  
calculating,  and  the  other  does  —  when  it  goes  against  convention  —  and 

40 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


doesn ’ t  —  when  it  relies  on  counting. 
I ’m  not  concerned  if  numbers  alter 
without rhyme or reason while I calculate.  Putnam ’ s first point is this: 

. . . [the] phenomenon [of conceptual relativity] turns on the fact that 
the  logical  primitives  themselves,  and  in  particular  the  notions  of 
object and existence, have a multitude of different uses rather than 
one absolute  ‘meaning ’. 

And second, 

Once  we  make  clear  how  we  are  using  ‘object ’  (or  ‘exist ’),  the 
question ‘How many objects exist? ’ has an answer that is not at all a 
matter of ‘convention ’. 

The  first  point  is  pretty  obvious  whenever  I  calculate  with  shapes. 
What I see before me depends on the rules I try.  Evans ’ s shape 

isn’ t anything in particular until I apply the rule (identity) 

�� 

to pick out triangles.  And if I use the rule 

�� 

it ’ s something different.  Then the second point — at least my version of it — 
is also clear.  It ’ s not up to me if there are triangles in the shape, but the result 
of calculating with the rule 

�� 

to see how triangles are embedded.  The only problem is that the rule can be 
used in different ways to get different results.  Of course, I can always insist 
that  the  rule  is  applied  everywhere  there ’ s  a  triangle.  And  I  even  have  an 

41 


G. STINY


algorithm  for  this  —  in  fact,  my  algorithm  works  for  any  rule. 
there ’ s a definite answer after all. 

So  maybe 

But  I  have  another  way  to  look  at  counting  that  gives  inconsistent 
results that aren ’ t so easy to bypass.  Suppose I start with the rule 

�� 

that erases equilateral triangles, and then apply the rule to the shape 

In the series of shapes 

� 

�

there are clearly two triangles.  That ’ s precisely how many I erase to make the 
shape 

disappear.  What better test for counting could I ever have?  And in this series 

� 

� 

�

there are three triangles.  With only a little fiddling around — rotate the shapes 
in the second series — it ’
s easy to see that both of the series are implicated in 
the series of shapes 

to confirm what I just said that it ’ s a striking way to calculate: the first series in 
going from the fourth shape 

42 


WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL


to the sixth shape 

and the second series in going from the sixth shape to the final shape 

s  the  last  —  that  I ’ve 
This  is  at  least  the  third  time  —  I  promise  it ’
shown a variation of the same thing.  I must be thinking about my students.  I 
show them how to calculate with shapes again and again.  They nod and insist 
they ’ve got it.  Only when it comes to doing it, they do exactly what they ’re 
used to.  They try constituents, and rely on all of the other bad habits — counting 
things  up,  saying  they ’re  complex  before  calculating,  etc.  —  that  I ’d  been 
trying to break.  Jacques Barzun in his nifty book on James calls this the ‘rubber -
band  effect ’. 
I  use  a  few  examples  —  like  the  ones  above  —  to  stretch  the 
rubber-band when I teach.  I do this as hard and as often as I can.  Once in a 
while,  I ’m  lucky .  The  rubber-band  snaps.  But  let ’ s  get  back  to  Putnam ’ s 
second point. 

I want to say that the parts a shape has depend on what happens to the 
shape as I calculate.  So long as I continue to try rules, parts may change.  But 
I’d like to be consistent about this whenever I can.  If I take the series of shapes 

seriously — and I do — then the parts of the shapes are the result of using the 
rule 

�� 

in  a  certain way.  Now  look  at  the  atoms  in Table  2.  They  take  care  of  the 
above  inconsistencies,  so  that  the  series  is  a  continuous  process.  And  I  can 
always  do  this  somehow  after  I ’m  through  calculating  —  with  topologies, 
Boolean algebras, lattices of different kinds, or comparable descriptive devices. 
But more than the variability that’ s introduced in this way, there are alternative 
ways  of  going  from  the  initial  shape  to  the  final  shape  that  imply  different 

43 


G. STINY 

parts  for  the  shapes  in  the  series.  What  these  parts  are  isn ’ t  a  matter  of 
convention, at least in the way that Putnam has in mind.  I can ’ t say what the 
parts are until I calculate.  There’ s real work to do to find out what’ s what.  I 
have  to  interact  with  shapes  in  the  general  sort  of  way  I  interact  with  other 
things like letters or numerals when I read or do arithmetic.  No doubt, I can 
contrive some method to reconcile any differences that arise from calculating 
in this way or that retrospectively, if it ever becomes useful.  Only this may not 
be the end of it.  Whether or not I go on to see other parts as I continue to try 
rules, there ’ s just no reason to think that differences aren ’ t real. 

One way to check on experience is to require that parts are numerically 
distinct: to ask the question how many and get the same answer with the same 
parts every time. An accountant is trained for this, and a school teacher expects 
it taking roll.  My local Selectman in Brookline is proud of it — ‘I’m logical, 
I’m an accountant’. 
I know just what she means.  I count at the market to make 
certain I ’ve got all of the items on my grocery list.  Counting is an everyday 
practice  that ’ s also good  for business and  science.  But  it ’ s only one kind of 
activity  among myriad  others.  Must  everything  that  counts work  this way? 
What  makes  counting  so  special?  Wittgenstein  muses  about  shapes  when 
they ’re added together , so that some of their lines fuse.  And James worries if 
counting is right for sensible experience. 

The  relation  of  numbers  to  experience  is  just  like  that  of 
‘kinds ’  in  logic.  So  long  as  experience will  keep  its  kind we  can 
handle  it by  logic.  So  long as  it will keep  its number we can deal 
with  it  by  arithmetic.  Sensibly,  however,  things  are  constantly 
changing their numbers, just as they are changing their kinds.  They 
are forever breaking apart and fusing. 

Simply  counting  parts  isn’ t  the  only  way  to  test  experience.  I  can  think  of 
other  things  to  do.  One  activity  is  the  key  to  visual  calculating.  Take  your 
finger and trace the parts you see.  Trust your eyes, no matter what parts there 
are or how often they alter.  Who cares whether numbers add up?  Rely on the 
embedding relation.  What you see is what you get. 

Minsky and Putnam cover some fascinating territory in which things 
can change.  But they shy away from the vast interior.  There’ s novelty there, 
and  the  chance  to  see  things  in  new  ways  again  and  again,  because  they ’re 
vague and ambiguous like shapes.  Artists, poets, madmen, and perhaps a few 
pragmatists have ventured  into  this  foreign  region with promiscuous  results. 
But no one has seen it all, or ever will.  There ’ s always more to see.  What ’ s

especially nice is to find that visual calculating may be a practical way to map 
some of the uncertain terrain. 

When it comes to handling novelty, I take James as broadly as I possibly 
can to include seeing new things — visiting Los  Angeles for the first time — 
and equivalently seeing things in new ways  — going back (looking again) to 
find out how the city has changed.  In both cases, the same question invokes 
novel experience.  What ’ s that?  And of course, this leads to visual calculating, 
while the above question — how many? — stays with calculating in the normal 
way.  James provides a neat example in Pragmatism: A New Name for Some 
Old Ways of Thinking: 

You can treat [this] figure 

as a star, as two big triangles crossing each other, as a hexagon with 
legs set up on its angles, as six equal triangles hanging together by 
their tips, etc. All these treatments are true treatments — the sensible 
that upon the paper resists no one of them.  You can say of a line that 
it  runs  east,  or  you  can  say  that  it  runs  west,  and  the  line  per  se 
accepts both descriptions without rebelling at the inconsistency. 

But why not try to define the options once and for all?  What would Evans say 
about  it?  I  count 24  constituents  —  six  long  lines  and  their  thirds  —  if  I’m 
going  to  look  for  triangles.  Halves don’ t work anymore.  They were ad hoc 
from  the  start.  Will  the  same  constituents  do  the  job  if  I  jiggle  the  two  big 
triangles a little to get another six small ones?  What happens if I jiggle harder 
and harder?  Or suppose lines stay put.  Then what about diamonds, trapezoids, 
and the pentagon in Wittgenstein ’ s addition?  And what about A’ s and X ’ s  — 
big ones and little ones?  But why should I try to limit my experience before I 
have it?  Isn ’ t that what planning is for?  There ’ s always something else to see 
every time I use another rule — as long as I calculate by seeing. 

James and other pragmatists got it right.  At least I think so, whenever 
I  calculate  with  shapes.  And  today  ‘neopragmatists ’
  walk  James ’ s  line  that 
runs east and west.  Richard Rorty ’ s ironist is a perfect example as he and she 
try  to  redescribe  things  to make  sense of  them  in  a kind of  literary  criticism 
instead of philosophy.  (This may say a lot more about a professional pecking 
order than about irony.  In Hollywood, writers want to be actors, actors directors, 

45 


G. STINY 

directors  producers,  and  producers  writers.  What  about  philosophers  and 
critics?)  The goal isn’ t coherence but to get around argument — reasoning — 
‘by  constantly  shifting  vocabularies,  thereby  changing  the  subject ’.  Rorty ’ s 
ironist always has another verbal trick to see things from a different perspective. 
It’ s not a question of truth but  ‘making things new’. 
Isn’ t this embedding all 
over again?  Just how does Rorty put it? 

I  have  defined  ‘dialectic ’
  as  the  attempt  to  play  off  vocabularies 
against  one  another,  rather  than merely  to  infer  propositions  from 
one another, and thus as the partial substitution of redescription for 
in fe rence .   I   used   Hege l ’ s   wo rd   because   I   th ink   o f   Hege l ’ s 
Phenomenology both as the beginning of the end of the Plato-Kant 
tradition  and  as  a  paradigm  of  the  ironist ’ s  ability  to  exploit  the 
possibilities of massive redescription.  Hegel ’ s so-called dialectical 
method is not an argumentative procedure or a way of unifying subject 
and object, but simply a literary skill — skill at producing surprising 
gestalt  switches  by  making  smooth,  rapid  transitions  from  one 
terminology to another. 

The  ironist  doesn ’ t  calculate  —  at  least  according  to  Rorty  —  but 
does precisely what I do when I calculate with shapes.  We both exploit myriad 
descriptions in order to do more.  It’ s just like politics.  There are no ends  — 
big  goals  like  truth  or  permanent  parts  —  only  means. 
I  apply  rules  in  an 
algorithmic  process,  while  the  ironist  uses  literary  skill  to  glide  effortlessly 
from  one  terminology  to  another  in  a  dialectic.  So  why  the  fuss?  Nothing 
stops me from changing descriptions — from being ironic — when I calculate. 
I ’ve  been  calculating  with  shapes  for  the  past  30  years,  and  this  is  simply 
business as usual.  There are many twists and turns.  Lionel March has followed 
most of them with me, and is especially good at saying what ’ s involved. 

Contrary  to  conventional  wisdom,  rationality  does  not  flourish  in 
the  presence  of  objective  certainty,  but  actually  thrives  around 
subjective  volition.  To  be  rational  requires  the  willingness  to 
restructure  the  world  on  each  contingent  occasion,  or  in  just  two 
words, TO DESIGN. 

And again for me, each contingent occasion is every time I try a rule.  Going 
on means always starting over.  There ’ s a new analysis that ’ s independent of 
any given before.  Parts fuse to erase prior distinctions, and the resulting shape 
divides according to the rule I use now.  It’ s all visual calculating — calculating 
by seeing.  I said at the beginning that I think about this in terms of design.  It 
appears I ’ve been dealing with design all along.

WHEN IS REASONING VISUAL 

So how are calculating and reasoning, and visual calculating and visual 
reasoning related?  Also at the beginning, I made two suggestions in the form 
of diagrams.  But right now, it’ s probably a far better bet to rely on the diagram

that changes my first one by reversing the relationship between reasoning and 
visual calculating.  I didn’ t plan it this way, yet it appears that visual calculating 
holds more than reasoning allows.  Maybe this isn’ t worth the bother of figuring 
out.  Perhaps the only relationships worth elaborating are these

that chart equivalencies between calculating by counting that asks how many 
— the ordinary kind of calculating we ’re used to — and calculating by seeing 
that  asks  what ’ s  that.  How  can  I  finally  decide?  Well,  if  calculating  and 
reasoning  — whether they ’re visual or not  — are anything at all like shapes, 
then it ’ s going to depend on how I calculate.  The relationships  — both what 
there is and how it ’ s connected — will change as I try rules.  We ’ll have to wait 
and see how it comes out.  What a pleasant way to spend a summer afternoon 
talking. 

Background 

The ideas in this paper have secure technical roots.  A summary of the 
main  details  —  including  the  relationship  between  calculating  by  counting 
and calculating by seeing — can be found in my recent paper ‘How to Calculate 
with Shapes ’.  It ’ s Chapter 2 in Formal Engineering Design Synthesis, edited 
by Erik Antonsson and Jon Cagan.  Cambridge University Press will publish 
the book later this year (2001).  If you have the patience I do, you may want to 
wait for my book Shape to be finished.  MIT Press hopes to publish it soon.

All  the  quotations  from  James  are  located  in  Chapter  XXII 
— 
‘Reasoning ’
 — in  The Principles of Psychology, except for the following five. 
The quotation on numbers and experience is in Chapter XXVIII, and the one 
on  genius  is  in  Chapter  XIX.  James  talks  about  concepts  and  perceptual 
experience  near  the  end  of  Chapter  XI  in  Some  Problems  of  Philosophy. 
Kierkegaard ’ s saying is found in Chapter IX in Essays in Radical Empiricism. 
And the description of the star is in Lecture 7 in Pragmatism: A New Name for 
Some Old Ways of Thinking. 

R. Narasimhan describes Evans ’ s grammar and how  it applies  to his 
shape  in  the  first  chapter  ‘Picture Languages ’
  in  the book Picture Language 
Machines, edited by S. Kaneff. 

The quotation from Wittgenstein appears in section V-40 in Remarks 
on  the Foundations of Mathematics.  The gloss on  situated  learning  is  taken 
from William  F.  Hanks ’ s  forward  to  Jean  Lave  and  Etienne Wenger ’ s  book 
Situated  Learning:  Legitimate  Peripheral  Participation.  Hanks ’ s  brief 
description  of  how  portable  skills  develop  ‘even when  coparticipants  fail  to 
share a common code’  is also worthwhile.  The material from Minsky is in two 
places.  His thoughts on creativity and the Body-Support concept are in section 
13.2  in The Society of Mind, and  the rest  is  in his chapter  ‘A Framework for 
Representing Knowledge ’   in Patrick Winston ’ s earlier book The Psychology 
of Computer Vision.  The  first quotation  from Putnam  is  in Lecture 2  in The 
Many Faces of Realism, while the other two are found in Lecture 1.  Langer 
deals with forms of symbolism in Philosophy in a New Key, Barzun describes 
the  rubber-band  effect  in  ‘The Masterpiece’
  in  A  Stroll  with William  James, 
and Rorty limns the ironist’ s literary skill in Chapter 4 of Contingency, Irony, 
and Solidarity.  Lionel March and I enjoy talking about design whenever we 
can at the Moustache Cafe in West Los Angeles, over a long lunch and a good 
bottle of wine. 

Acknowledgment  Mine  Ozkar  did  all  of  the  shapes  for me  with  her  usual 
care and enthusiasm.  She also made sure they were in the right places, even as 
my descriptions of what was going on changed.
