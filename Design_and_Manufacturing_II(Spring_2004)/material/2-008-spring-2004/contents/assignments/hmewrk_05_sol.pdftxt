Problem 1 

As demonstrated in class, springback is a problem which must be addressed when bending sheet 
metal. It occurs because there is always an elastic regio0n (albeit, sometimes very small) within 
the sheet which wants to return to its original state after the bending operation. The springback of 
the bent sheet can be approximated using the expression

where, as shown in Figure 1, Ri and Rf are the initial and final bend radii, Y is the yield strength 
and E is the elastic modulus of the metal, and T is the thickness of the sheet. As illustrated in 
Figure 1, the main effects of springback are that the final radius of curvature is larger than the 
initial radius and the final bend angle, αf, is smaller than the initial angle, αi. One approach to 
compensate for springback is to overbend the part (i.e., bend the sheet more than you want, 
hoping that it will spring back to the desired shape). Consider the bending of an aluminium sheet 
(Al 1200-O) with Y=5075 psi, E=106 psi, and T=1/8 in. 

(1)

a)	 Which case will result in more springback: Ri = 1 in or Ri  = 2 in? Why? 

b)	 You are given a sketch of the setup for bending operation as shown in Figure 2. The target 
angle for the bend is 90° and Ri = 2 in. The process engineers aren´t certain how much of 
an angle to specify for the initial bend. After assuming that the length of the bent region 
of the sheet, s, stays constant and doing some geometry, they used Eq. 1 to find that the 
difference between the initial and final bend angles will be approximately 2°. What value 
should they specify for 
θ?

Calculating the ratio of the initial and final radii reveals that springback increases with increased 
Ri. From looking at the equation we see that increasing Ri  (while keeping everything else 
constant) has the same effect as increasing Y (Yield Strength) or decreasing E (Young´s 
Modulus), which will clearly lead to a greater springback. This makes sense because a bigger 
initial radius means that the stress in the material due to bending will be lower and therefore the 
ratio plastic deformation vs. elastic deformation will be smaller which leads to a greater 
springback. 

β) 

We want to overbend the part to compensate for the springback. Thus θ should be 88°.
