Homework #2:  Injection Molding 

2.008 Design and Manufacturing II 
Spring 2004 

Out: February 18th 
Due: February 25th 

Problem 1: 

What  are  the  design  considerations  in  replacing  a  metal  container  for  carbonated 
beverages with plastic bottles? Think  about  the  functional  requirements  and  explain how 
the design of a plastic container differs from that of a metal can. 

Problem 2: 

Consider  the  injection molded L-bracket made of Polycarbonate  shown  in Figure 1. You 
are asked to find the mold design with the parting line that leads to the minimum possible 
clamping force to mold the part.

a)	 What  would  be  the  minimum  clamping  force  required  for  this  part?  Indicate  the 
location  of  gate  and  the  location  of  parting  line/plane  for  the minimum  clamping 
force  design.  Assume  that  the  peak  injection  pressure  is  6,000  psi.  Also  discuss 
the potential problems in producing the part with this design. 

b)	 You  soon  realize  that  the  minimum  clamping  force  is  not  as  important  as  the 
quality  of  the  part  and  productivity  of  the  process  (as  long  as  the  machine  has 
enough  clamping  force).
  i)  What  would  be  a  better  position  of  the  parting 
line/plane  and  gate  and  direction  of  injection  molding?  Why?  ii)  What  is  the 
clamping force required for the new design? 

Problem 3: 

The  following  pictures  show  one  half  of  an  injection  molded  housing.  With  the  basic 
design  rules  for  injection  molding  in  mind,  is  this  a  good  design?  Explain  why/why  not 
and  suggest  any  improvements  you  might  want  to  make.  If  you  would  like  to  you  can 
make a sketch to explain your thoughts.

Problem 4: 

You  are  going  to  make  tools  for  your  Yo-Yo  in  two  weeks.  You  should  define  your 
functional  requirements  first  before  you  seek  design  parameters,  which  meet  the 
requirements.  Please  define  the  functional  requirements  of  your  own  Yo-Yo  and  try  to 
find  design  parameters  that  fulfill  those  requirements.  Show  the  mapping  process  in-
between  “What”  and  “How”  at  the  top  two  levels.  This  is  not  a  single  solution  problem. 
In  the  world  of  design,  you,  as  a  designer,  have  all  the  power  to  explore  any  possible 
design  (at  least  until  it  is  proven  to  be  a  poor  one).  Feel  free  to  sketch  your  design  on  a 
piece of paper.
