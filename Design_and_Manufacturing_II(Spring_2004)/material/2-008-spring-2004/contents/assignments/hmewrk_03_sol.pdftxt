Merchant’s hypothesis  is  that  the  shear  plane  is  located  to minimize  the  cutting  force,  or 
where  the  shear  stress  is  maximum.  Derive  the  Merchant’s  relationship  between  shear 
angle, rake angle, and friction angle as below from the diagram above.

(b)  Consider  the  directions  of  the  cutting  force  and  the  thrust  force.  Fc,  cutting  force,  is 
always  positive,  since  the material  is  removed.  Is  the  thrust  force,  Ft,  also  positive  at  all 
times?  If  not,  explain  why.  Also  explain  how  you  can  make  Ft  =  0  for  a  given  friction 
coefficient between the tool and the work piece. 

Solution 
(a)

From the Force diagram (we discussed it in class so you know how each of the elements 

came in), we know that 


Fs = Fc*cosφ - Ft*sinφ 
Fn = Fc*sinφ + Ft*cosφ 
Where 

Fc = net horizontal cutting force  

Ft = net vertical thrust force 


(1)

(2)


Fs = shear force along shear plane 
Fn = shear force normal to shear plane 

There are two ways to derive Merchant´s Relationship: find the minimum of the cutting 
force or the maximum of the shear stress. We will have a look at both.

With σs as the shear stress and As the shear area; t0 is the thickness of the uncut chip, 
called the depth of cut, w is the width of the work.

(5)

In order for the cutting force to be minimum at angle  ϕ , the first derivative has to be 

zero:


∂F
c = 0
∂ϕ 
Substituting equation (5) and solving:

⇔ cos ϕi[cos ϕ − sin ϕ tan( β − α)] = sin ϕi[sin ϕ +  cos ϕ tan( β − α)] 
2⇔ cos  ϕ −  sin 2 ϕ =  2 cos ϕ sin ϕ tan(β − α) 

With the trigonometric expressions 

cos  ϕ − sin 2 ϕ =  cos 2 ϕ 
2
2 cos  ϕ sin  ϕ =
sin  2  ϕ 
 

we get 

cos 2 ϕ =  sin 2 ϕ tan(β − α) 
⇔ tan 2 ϕ =  cot( β − α) 

And another trigonometric expression:  tan 2 ϕ = cot(π / 2 −

Which leads us to

ii) Find the maximum of the shear stress 

The shear stress is given by


σs  =

 
Fs/Area

 

(6)


If the width of the work is given by w, and the uncut chip thickness is to, the area along 

which Fs acts is 


Area = to*w/sinφ

Equation (6) then becomes with (1) and (7) 


σs  = (Fc*cosφ - Ft*sinφ) / (to*w/sinφ) 

From the force diagram we also know that  


Ft/Fc = tan(β-α) 

Substituting (9) in (8), we have 


 (7)


(8)  


(9)  


σs  = [Fc*sinφ(cosφ - tan(β-α)*sinφ)] / (to*w) 

(10) 


Now, in order for the shear stress to be maximum at angle φ


∂σs  /∂φ = 0 


Substituting equation (10) and solving 

∂σs  /∂φ = 1/to*w[Fc(cos2φ - sin2φ) – Fc(tan(β-α)*2*sinφ*cosφ)] 

From trigonometry we know 

cos  ϕ − sin 2 ϕ =
cos 2 ϕ
2
 
2 cos  ϕ sin  ϕ = sin  2  ϕ 

Substituting and equating to zero, we have 

Fc*cos2φ = Fc*sin2φ*tan(β-α)  → 

tan2φ = cot(β-α) 

(11) 

Again, from trigonometry:  tan 2 ϕ = cot( π / 2 −   ϕ  ) 
2
The principal solution is 

π/2 - 2φ = β-α 

→  2φ = π/2 + α – β 

→ 

φ = π/4 + α/2 - β/2 

(b) 
We know that 

Ft = R sin(β - α) and Ft = Fc tan(β - α) 

The magnitude of Fc is always positive (since the direction of the feed is always towards 

the material); the sign of Ft can be either positive or negative, depending on the relative 

magnitudes of β and α. When β > α, the sign of Ft is positive (downward) and when β < 

α, it is negative (upward). Therefore, in order to make the thrust force = 0, we make β = 

α. This can be achieved in two ways:

1) Change the rake angle of the tool, α. 

2) By adding lubricant, effectively changing the friction angle β. 


It is the second step that we most commonly employ in machining when something is

“wrong” in the cut.


Problem 2: 

Your lab group decided to make fancy transparent-look Yo-Yos and designed the body of 
the  Yo-Yo  to  be  injection  molded  as  follows.  For  a  solid  look,  two  identical  parts  are 
supposed to be assembled with an insert-molded bolt and nut. 

2.5”

Figure 1. Injection molded YoYo body 

a)	 After  learning  about polymer materials  and processes,  you now  know  this  design 
is  not  good  for  injection  molding.  Make  necessary  design  changes  on  the  figure 
below and explain why you chose to make them. 
b) 	 The  material  provided  by  Dave  and  Pat  is  Polypropylene,  which  is  translucent. 
Explain  in  one  sentence  why  Polypropylene  (PP)  is  not  transparent.  After 
searching  for  crystal  clear  and  high  impact  resistant  materials,  you  find  out  that 
polycarbonate (PC) is the right one for your nude Yo-Yo. Why is PC transparent? 
(1  sentence)  Are  those  materials  thermosetts  or  thermoplastic?  How  you  can 
prove that? 
c)	 From  the  manufcaturer  of  the  Polycarbonate  resin,  you  received  the  modulus-
temperature curves shown below. Which is the right M-T curve of Polycarbonate? 
(A or B?) What is the approximate Tg of PC? 
d) 	 What would be the clamping force required for this part? Choose a proper parting 
line  and  assume  the  injection  pressure  is  1000  psi  with  a  packing  process  which 
requires a packing pressure about twice the injection pressure. 
f)	 The  cycle  time  of  the  part  (after  making  necessary  design  changes  in  (a))  is  still 
measured  as  2 minute.  It  is  composed  of mold  filling  (10%),  part  cooling  (75%), 
ejecting  and  mold  closing,  etc.  This  cycle  time  cannot  justify  the  selling  price  at 
the  market.  Therefore  you  redesigned  it  with  40%  reduction  of  the  thickness  of 
the  part.  Assume  that  the  thickness  is  changed  uniformly  over  the  whole  part. 
Please estimate the new cycle time.

Solution  
a)

parting line 

Reasons for the design changes: 
•	 Use  uniform  wall  thicknesses  throughout  the  part.  This  will  minimize  sinking, 
warping, residual stresses, and improve mold fill and cycle times. 
•	 Use generous radius at all corners. The inside corner radius should be a minimum of 
one base wall thickness?? 
•	 Use  the  least  thickness  compliant  with  the  process,  material,  or  product  design 
requirements.  Using  the  least  wall  thickness  for  the  process  ensures  rapid  cooling, 
short  cycle  times,  and  minimum  shot  weight.  All  these  result  in  the  least  possible 
part cost. 

b) 

PP  is  translucent  because  it  is  a  crystalline  material.  PC  is  transparent  because  it  is 

amorphous.  

PP and PC are both thermoplastics. A method to find out if this is true would be to reheat

the finished product to processing temperature. If it melts it is a thermoplastic.


c) 

Curve B  is clearly a  temperature-modulus curve for an amorphous material and  therefore 

applies to PC. Tg is approximately 90 - 100° C. 


d) 

A packing pressure of twice the injection pressure means that after the first injection with

1000  Psi  an  additional  stroke with  2000  Psi  is  applied  in  order  to  pack more material  to  

compensate the shrinkage. The required clamping force is area*pressure. With the parting  

line as indicated in the figure in a) the clamping force becomes:  

2000 Psi * 3.14*1.25² = 9812.5 lbs =about 5 tons


e) 

A  reduction  of  the  wall  thickness  and  therefore  of  the  volume  of  material  injected  will  

reduce  the  injection  time  as  well  as  the  cooling  time.  The  new  cycle  time  can  be  

calculated according to the following equation: 


(1)  The  filling  time  will  be  decreased  by  40%:  the  new  filling  time  =  0.6x  (0.1x120 
sec) = 7.2 sec 
(2)  The  cooling  time  is  be  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  thickness  decrease:  new 
cooling time = (0.6)2 x (0.75 x 120) =  32.4 sec 
(3)  Ejecting, mold closing time will be the same = 0.15 x 120 = 18sec 

The new cycle time: 57.6 sec (52% reduction !!!)
