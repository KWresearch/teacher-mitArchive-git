Problem 1 

As demonstrated  in  class,  springback  is  a problem which must be addressed when bending  sheet 
metal.  It  occurs  because  there  is  always  an  elastic  region  (albeit,  sometimes  very  small)  within 
the sheet which wants to return to its original state after the bending operation. The springback of 
the bent sheet can be approximated using the expression

where,  as  shown  in Figure 1, Ri and Rf are  the  initial and  final bend  radii, Y  is  the yield  strength 
and  E  is  the  elastic  modulus  of  the  metal,  and  T  is  the  thickness  of  the  sheet.  As  illustrated  in 
Figure  1,  the  main  effects  of  springback  are  that  the  final  radius  of  curvature  is  larger  than  the 
initial  radius  and  the  final  bend  angle,  αf,  is  smaller  than  the  initial  angle,  αi.  One  approach  to 
compensate  for  springback  is  to  overbend  the  part  (i.e.,  bend  the  sheet  more  than  you  want, 
hoping  that  it will  spring back  to  the desired  shape). Consider  the bending of an aluminum  sheet 
(Al 1200-O) with Y=5075 psi, E=106 psi, and T=1/8 in.

a)	 Which case will result in more springback: Ri = 1 in or Ri  = 2 in? Why? 

b)	 You are given a sketch of the setup for bending operation as shown in Figure 2. The target 
angle for  the bend  is 90° and Ri  = 2 in. The process engineers aren´t certain how much of 
an  angle  to  specify  for  the  initial  bend. After  assuming  that  the  length  of  the  bent  region 
of  the  sheet,  s,  stays  constant  and  doing  some  geometry,  they  used  Eq.  1  to  find  that  the 
difference between  the  initial and  final bend angles will be approximately 2°. What value 
should they specify for 
θ?
