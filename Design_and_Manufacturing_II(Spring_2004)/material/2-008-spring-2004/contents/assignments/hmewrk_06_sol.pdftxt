Problem 1 

You are responsible for two different manufacturing lines, both of which produce arms for Karl´s 
Mechanical Squid. The Upper Specification Limit of the line is 3.52 and the Lower Specification 
Limit is 3.18. Line 1 produces arms with a µ of 3.35 and an σ of 0.07. Line 2 produces arms with 
a µ of 3.43 and an σ of 0.05. 
a)  For Line 1: what is the Cp? What is the Cpk? 
For Line 2: what is the Cp? What is the Cpk? 
b)  Which line produces a greater percentage of parts within the specification limits? What 
are the exact percentages for each line? 

Solution 

a) 

b) 

Line 1: 
3.52 − 3.18 
= 0.81
C P  =
i 
6 0.07  
3.35 − 3.18 
z min 
= 
3iσ

C Pk 
=
Line 2: 

3.52 − 3.18 
C P  =
= 1.13
i 
6 0.05  
z min 
3.52 − 3.43 
= 
3iσ

= 0.81

 

 

 

 

= 0.6

C Pk 
=
Line 1: 

UCL − µ  3.52 − 3.35

z UCL  =
= 
0.07 

σ 
LCL − µ  3.18 − 3.35 

z LCL  =
 
= − 2.43
= 
0.07 
σ 
Using the table on slide 17 lecture 15 (“Quality”): P(z<zUCL) = 0.9925 
Using the table on slide 16 lecture 15 (“Quality”): P(z<zLCL) = 0.0075 
Percentage of parts within the specification limits: P=(0.9925-0.0075)*100% = 98.5 % 

= 2.43

 

= 1.8

Line 2: 

UCL − µ  3.52 − 3.43

z UCL  =
= 
0.05

σ 
LCL − µ  3.18 − 3.43

z LCL  =
= − 5 
= 
0.05 
σ 
Using the table on slide 17 lecture 15 (“Quality”): P(z<zUCL) = 0.9641 
P(z<zLCL=-5) ≈ 0 
Percentage of parts within the specification limits: P=0.9641*100% = 96.41 % 

 

Æ Line 1 produces a greater percentage of parts within the specification limits!
