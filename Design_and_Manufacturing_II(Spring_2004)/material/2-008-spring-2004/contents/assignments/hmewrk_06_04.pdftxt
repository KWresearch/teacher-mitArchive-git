You are responsible for two different manufacturing lines, both of which produce arms for Karl´s 
Mechanical Squid. The Upper Specification Limit of the line is 3.52 and the Lower Specification 
Limit is 3.18. Line 1 produces arms with a µ of 3.35 and an σ of 0.07. Line 2 produces arms with 
a µ of 3.43 and an σ of 0.05. 

a)	 For Line 1: what is the Cp? What is the Cpk? 

For Line 2: what is the Cp? What is the Cpk? 


b)	 Which line produces a greater percentage of parts within the specification limits? What 
are the exact percentages for each line?
