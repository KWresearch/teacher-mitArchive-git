Solution Homework #4 

2.008 Design and Manufacturing II 
Spring 2004 

Problem 1: 
The  purpose  of  this  problem  is  to  have  you  understand  the  effect  of  heat  intensity  of 
various welding  heat  sources  on  the  interaction  time  and  the  feed  rate.  For  a  planar  heat 
source on steel, the interaction  time,  tm, was given at  the lecture as below. H.I. is the heat 
intensity, in W/cm2. You are supposed to weld a straight lap joint with a length of 40 cm. 

tm= (5000/H.I.)2 

a)	 You have manual oxyacetylene welding equipment, which has a weld pool size of 
10 mm. How long will it take to finish the job? Assume the H.I of an 
oxyacetylene welding source is 103 W/cm2. 

b)	 If your boss buys you new SMAW (shielded Metal Arc Welding) equipment, 
which is 3 times more expensive than the oxyacetylene equipment, how long will 
it take to finish the same job? Will it justify the purchase of the SMAW tool? 
Assume that SMAW has H.I of 104 W/cm2  and the weld pool size is 5 mm. 

c)	 The upgrade in b) has been very successful, and made a huge increase of the 
productivity in your division. If your boss considers buying you the state-of-the-
art laser welding system with a hope to make a big breakthrough one more time, 
what would be your advice to your boss before he buys one? Assume the laser has 
the HI of 106W/cm2 with a weld pool size of 1 mm. Consider your assessment in 
the following way:  

- What should be the minimum speed of the welding to avoid over melting 
(or vaporization)? 
Can you handle it manually? Or will you need a robot to handle this heat 
source?

Solution 
a)	
interaction time:

feed rate: 

total time:  


tm= (5000/10³)² = 25s 
f = d/tm = 1/25 = 0.4 mm/s 
T = L/f = 400/0.4 = 1000s = 16.67 min 

b)	

tm= (5000/104)² = 0.25s 
interaction time: 
f = d/tm = 1/25 = 20 mm/s 
feed rate: 
total time: 
T = L/f = 400/20 = 20s 
The total time is 50 times less than before. The net increase of the productivity 
may be less than 5000%, but will more than enough to justify the purchase of the 

SMAW equipment. However, the fast welding speed may require the use of a 
robot to maintain the process quality and uniformity, which would add additional 
cost of automation.  

c)  interaction time: 
tm= (5000/106)² = 25µs

f = d/tm  = 1/25e-6 = 40 m/s 
feed rate = vmin 
The minimum speed is 40 m/s which is clearly too high to be achieved either 
manually or automatically. Thus even the purchase of an industrial robot would 
not help to do the job successfully. You would better tell your boss to not buy the 
equipment! 

Problem 2 
Aligning an optical fiber to the laser light source with less than 1 µm transverse error is a 
demanding task. V-grooved Silicon substrate has been developed to enable accurate and 
cost effective interconnection without the use of highly skilled labor and expensive 
fixtures. 

The technology is available through the KOH bulk micromachining of the {100} silicon. 
The mechanical tolerances delivered can be tight with this method at a relatively low 
processing cost. Assume that the diameter of an optical fiber is 160 µm and that the fiber 
is aligned along the B-B’ direction of the groove. The cross sectional shape of the groove 
along A-A’ is given in Figure 2-1.

A-A’ cross section 

Figure 2-1 A self terminated V-groove is formed on the {100} plane. 

a)	 As etching proceeds, the exposed {100} planes etch rapidly while the {111} 
planes etch slowly, which causes the angle θ with the plane of the wafer. What is 
the magnitude of the angle θ? 
b) 	 The etch mask material is silicon nitride, which is better than silicon oxide in 
terms of dimensional accuracy of the V-groove. If the center of the fibercore is 

located exactly on the surface plane of the silicon, what is the depth of the V-
groove, h, and width of the groove opening, w? 
c)	 Assume the KOH solution etches the (100) silicon at 2 µm/min and the thickness 
of the wafer is 500 µm. What will be the etching time needed for the V-groove in 
Figure 2-1? 

Solution 
a)  According to the lecture notes and corresponding literature θ = 54.7°. 

b)

θ90-

θ 

The figure reveals the following relationships: 

sin (90-θ)=d/2h

h = d/(2sin(90-θ)) = 138.4 µm

w = 2*h*tan(90-θ) = 196 µm 


c)  t = h/v = 138.4/2 min = 69.2 min 

This is a long process time to etch. Therefore this kind of bulk micromaching is 
not really adequate for mass production. Note that the V-groove etching stops 
when the two slopes from the top surface opening meet together at an angle of 
54.7°, and that the thickness of the wafer should be greater than the depth h of the 
groove.
