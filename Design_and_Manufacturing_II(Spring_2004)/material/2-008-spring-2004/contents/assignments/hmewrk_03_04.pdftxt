Problem 1: 

(a)  Consider  the  Merchant’s  Cutting  Force  diagram  in  Figure  1  and  the  chip-workpiece 
interface during orthogonal cutting in Fig. 2.

Merchant’s hypothesis  is  that  the  shear  plane  is  located  to minimize  the  cutting  force,  or 
where  the  shear  stress  is  maximum.  Derive  the  Merchant’s  relationship  between  shear 
angle, rake angle, and friction angle as below from the diagram above.

(b)  Consider  the  directions  of  the  cutting  force  and  the  thrust  force.  Fc,  cutting  force,  is 
always  positive,  since  the material  is  removed.  Is  the  thrust  force,  Ft,  also  positive  at  all 
times?  If  not,  explain  why.  Also  explain  how  you  can  make  Ft  =  0  for  a  given  friction 
coefficient between the tool and the work piece. 

Problem 2: 

Your lab group decided to make fancy transparent-look Yo-Yos and designed the body of 
the  Yo-Yo  to  be  injection  molded  as  follows.  For  a  solid  look,  two  identical  parts  are 
supposed to be assembled with an insert-molded bolt and nut.

a)	 After  learning  about polymer materials  and processes,  you now  know  this  design 
is  not  good  for  injection  molding.  Make  necessary  design  changes  on  the  figure 
below and explain why you chose to make them.

b)	 The  material  provided  by  Dave  and  Pat  is  Polypropylene,  which  is  translucent. 
Explain  in  one  sentence  why  Polypropylene  (PP)  is  not  transparent.  After 
searching  for  crystal  clear  and  high  impact  resistant  materials,  you  find  out  that 
polycarbonate (PC) is the right one for your nude Yo-Yo. Why is PC transparent? 
(1  sentence)  Are  those  materials  thermosetts  or  thermoplastic?  How  you  can 
prove that? 

c)	 From  the  manufcaturer  of  the  Polycarbonate  resin,  you  received  the  modulus-
temperature curves shown below. Which is the right M-T curve of Polycarbonate? 
(A or B?) What is the approximate Tg of PC? 

d)	 What would be the clamping force required for this part? Choose a proper parting 
line  and  assume  the  injection  pressure  is  1000  psi  with  a  packing  process  which 
requires a packing pressure about twice the injection pressure. 
f)	 The  cycle  time  of  the  part  (after  making  necessary  design  changes  in  (a))  is  still 
measured  as  2 minute.  It  is  composed  of mold  filling  (10%),  part  cooling  (75%), 
ejecting  and  mold  closing,  etc.  This  cycle  time  cannot  justify  the  selling  price  at 
the  market.  Therefore  you  redesigned  it  with  40%  reduction  of  the  thickness  of 
the  part.  Assume  that  the  thickness  is  changed  uniformly  over  the  whole  part. 
Please estimate the new cycle time.
