Problem 1: 
The  purpose  of  this  problem  is  to  have  you  understand  the  effect  of  heat  intensity  of 
various welding  heat  sources  on  the  interaction  time  and  the  feed  rate.  For  a  planar  heat 
source on steel, the interaction  time,  tm, was given at  the lecture as below. H.I. is the heat 
intensity, in W/cm2. You are supposed to weld a straight lap joint with a length of 40 cm. 

tm= (5000/H.I.)2 

a)	 You have manual oxyacetylene welding equipment, which has a weld pool size of 
10 mm. How long will it take to finish the job? Assume the H.I of an 
oxyacetylene welding source is 103 W/cm2. 

b)	 If your boss buys you new SMAW (shielded Metal Arc Welding) equipment, 
which is 3 times more expensive than the oxyacetylene equipment, how long will 
it take to finish the same job? Will it justify the purchase of the SMAW tool? 
Assume that SMAW has H.I of 104 W/cm2  and the weld pool size is 5 mm. 

c)	 The upgrade in b) has been very successful, and made a huge increase of the 
productivity in your division. If your boss considers buying you the state-of-the-
art laser welding system with a hope to make a big breakthrough one more time, 
what would be your advice to your boss before he buys one? Assume the laser has 
the HI of 106W/cm2 with a weld pool size of 1 mm. Consider your assessment in 
the following way:  

- What should be the minimum speed of the welding to avoid over melting 
(or vaporization)? 
Can you handle it manually? Or will a robot handle the welding 
operation with this heat source?

Problem 2 
Aligning an optical fiber to the laser light source with less than 1 µm transverse error is a 
demanding task. V-grooved Silicon substrate has been developed to enable accurate and 
cost effective interconnection without the use of highly skilled labor and expensive 
fixtures. 

The technology is available through the KOH bulk micromachining of the {100} silicon. 
The mechanical tolerances delivered can be tight with this method at a relatively low 
processing cost. Assume that the diameter of an optical fiber is 160 µm and that the fiber 
is aligned along the B-B’ direction of the groove. The cross sectional shape of the groove 
along A-A’ is given in Figure 2-1.

Figure 2-1 A self terminated V-groove is formed on the {100} plane. 

a)	 As etching proceeds, the exposed {100} planes etch rapidly while the {111} 
planes etch slowly, which causes the angle θ with the plane of the wafer. What is 
the magnitude of the angle θ? 
β)	 The etch mask material is silicon nitride, which is better than silicon oxide in 
terms of dimensional accuracy of the V-groove. If the center of the fibercore is 
located exactly on the surface plane of the silicon, what is the depth of the V-
groove, h, and width of the groove opening, w? 
c)	 Assume the KOH solution etches the (100) silicon at 2 µm/min and the thickness 
of the wafer is 500 µm. What will be the etching time needed for the V-groove in 
Figure 2-1?
