Problem 1:  

Do review question 5 of the handout, Chapter 1 of Benhabib’s book. 
“Compare Ford’s passenger car manufacturing and marketing  strategies  in  the early 20th 
century  to  those  implemented  by  GM.  Elaborate  on  the  continuing  use  of  these 
competitive practices in today’s manufacturing industries.” 

Solution: 
In  the  early  20th  century,  car  manufacturing  at  Ford  as  well  as  at  GM  was  a 
capital-intensive  activity,  driven  by  the  forces  of  mass  production.  A  specialized 
workforce  in  which  the  individuals  performed  small  tasks  over  and  over  again  reduced 
production  costs  dramatically.  This  manufacturing  and  assembly  process  was  made 
possible by product standardization. 

The Ford Motor Company pushed  this manufacturing  technique  to  its  extreme by 
applying Taylor´s “scientific management” concept to its assembly lines. This included a 
lack  of  customer  choices  by  selling  only  one  or  very  few  products  in  high  volumes. The 
marketing  strategy  behind 
this  concept  was 
to  sell  cars  by 
their 
low  price 
(competitiveness-via-price strategy). 

GM  used  standardization  techniques  as  well  as  Ford  to  cut  down  manufacturing 
costs.  But  with  standardized  components  (platforms),  different  models  were  built, 
covering multiple pricing categories. Using  the same parts  for different models helped  to 
maintain  low  prices  and  to  sell  high  volumes  while  different  models  addressed  a  wide 
field of customers by offering some choice. In addition minor changes were introduced in 
frequent intervals, which kept the products up to date. 

Current manufacturing  is  still driven by  low-cost mass production  as well as by a 
need for flexibility. As  industrial design (color, style) a mainstream issue,  the technology 
gap between  different manufacturers  becomes  small,  and  companies  keep  decreasing  the 
product  lifecycle  to  attract  more  customers.  In  order  to  maintain  a  balance  between  the 
cost  and  flexibility,  new  techniques  have  been  developed,  such  as  MRP,  JIT  as  well  as 
the  flexible  manufacturing  systems.  Extensive  use  of  IT-systems  and  computer-based 
tools  throughout  the  complete  manufacturing  process  is  a  necessity  in  order  to  stay 
competitive. 

Problem 2: 

Do discussion question 9 of the same handout. 
“Fast  food  outlets  have  been  managed  via  familiar  manufacturing  strategies  that  have 
been evolved over the past century, moving from a mass-production environment to mass 
customization.  Discuss  and  compare  the  manufacturing  strategies  of  McDonalds  and 
Subway  (or  Chinese  food  truck  at Mass  Ave.  and  LaVerde).  Sketch  the  process  flow  of 
each case. 
Name  engineering  products  which  are  produced  by  a  similar  manufacturing  strategy  for 
each case.” 

Solution: 
McDonalds/food  truck  offer  standardized  products  with  an  apparent  pull 
production system (when an order comes  in or when  the storage  level of specific product 
falls below some number, the production (assembly) starts). Products with a high demand 
might  even  be  pre-made  and  ready  to  go.  High  throughput  and  low  cost  are  the  main 
target.  Every  product  is  “assembled”  in  a  standardized  sequence,  using  always  the  same 
set  of  ingredients.  Some  ingredients  are  a  part  of  more  than  one  product,  though  (the 
circles in the process flow overlap each other). 
Most  of  the mass  production  systems  and  batch  production  systems  have  similar  natures 
as seen in McDonalds/food truck. They include automobiles and computers (DELL: order 
one, produce one with a near complete product.).

Subway/La  Verde  offer  a  variety  of  choices,  which  can  be  customized  as  the 
product  is made upon demand. Target  is high quality and high customer  satisfaction. For 
this  higher  value,  the  customer  has  to  pay  a  higher  price  and/or  their  patience. This  type 
of  production  is  the  same  as  many  job  shops,  which  produce  fully  custom  ordered 
products, such as airplanes, lithography machines, and custom-designed houses.
