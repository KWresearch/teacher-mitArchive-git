Problem 1: 

What  are  the  design  considerations  in  replacing  a  metal  container  for  carbonated 
beverages with plastic bottles? Think  about  the  functional  requirements  and  explain how 
the design of a plastic container differs from that of a metal can. 

Solution 
While  the  functional  requirements,  naturally,  are  almost  the  same  for  metal  and  plastic 
containers  (remember:  functional  requirements  are  “what  you  want”  and  solution-
neutral), the design parameters to fulfill the functional requirements may differ. 
In particular the following differences can be stated: 
o	 Since plastic is a cheap material and less dense than metal, the urge for a material-
saving design is not as strong as when using aluminum. 
o	 Special attention has to be paid to the permeability of plastic. In order to conserve 
the  gas  for  a  long  period  of  time  (less  than  15%  loss  in  120  days,  from  the 
lecture), a special processing with low permeability plastic is necessary. 
o	 Plastic  is  not  as  strong  as  metal.  The  wall  thickness  can  be  increased,  small 
corrugation or, better, a wavy  structure  (like  small coke bottles) can be used. The 
bottom is usually thick to provide rigidity and a save stand. 
o	 Because  plastic  is  easier  to  form  into  complicated  shapes  than  cans,  it  became 
more  feasible  to  make  them  more  aesthetically  and  ergonomically  pleasing; 
hence, soda in bottles again, but now with grippy sides. Also scaling up the size is 
feasible.  
In principle, plastic didn’t eat that much of Al cans, but replaced most of the glass 
bottles.

Consider  the  injection molded L-bracket made of Polycarbonate  shown  in Figure 1. You 
are asked to find the mold design with the parting line that leads to the minimum possible 
clamping force to mold the part.

a)	 What  would  be  the  minimum  clamping  force  required  for  this  part?  Indicate  the 
location  of  gate  and  the  location  of  parting  line/plane  for  the minimum  clamping 
force  design.  Assume  that  the  peak  injection  pressure  is  6,000  psi.  Also  discuss 
the potential problems in producing the part with this design. 

b)	 You  soon  realize  that  the  minimum  clamping  force  is  not  as  important  as  the 
quality  of  the  part  and  productivity  of  the  process  (as  long  as  the  machine  has 
enough  clamping  force).
  i)  What  would  be  a  better  position  of  the  parting 
line/plane  and  gate  and  direction  of  injection  molding?  Why?  ii)  What  is  the 
clamping force required for the new design? 

Solution a) 
The  minimum  cross-sectional  area  projected  on  the  parting  plane  A  will  require  the 
minimum clamping force. 

Amin=62-52=11mm2 
Fmin=PxAmin=6000 x 11/(25.4)2=102.3 lbs=0.05 ton 

However,  this  parting  line  is  not  a  good  choice  due  to  the  following  potential 
problems. 

Potential Problems 
a)  The  hole  on  the  vertical  wall  from  the  parting  plane  needs  a  sliding  core,  which 
makes it costly in mold machining and injection molding operations. 
b)  High aspect ratio deep groove machining on the cavity plate is needed, which may 
require  the  use  of  very  expensive  machines,  like:  EDM  (Electro  Discharge 
Machining)  machine.  If  you  move  the  parting  line  along  the  z-axis,  you  need  to 
machine both the cavity plate and core plate, which is also costly. 
c)	 High  aspect  ratio  and  little/no  draft  angle  in  vertical  (or  injection)  direction  will 
make it very difficult to eject the molded part. 

Solution b) 
Normally,  the  clamping  capacity  of  injection  molding  machines  is  over  10  tons  and 
the  magnitude  of  it  is  not  an  important  parameter  with  few  exceptions. Mold  design 
for  better  quality  of  parts  and  lower  cost  process  is  much  more  important  than  the 
minimum  clamping  force. When  you  choose  a  parting  line  or  plane,  the  direction  of 
injection is of more importance, in general. 

i)	 Parting plane B  and C  are much better  choices  than plane A, with  a gate  location 
marked in Figure 1 above. Because, 
ii)  The  injection  direction  normal  to  the  parting  plane  B/C  does  not  require  any 
sliding  core  to  form  the  whole  feature  at  the  bottom.  Also,  slight  draft  angle  can 
be given to the side of cavity, with a conventional milling machine. With the gate 
position marked  in  the  figure, a weld  line will be formed across  the hole from  the 
gate.  Since  the  weld  line  is  formed  while  the  melt  temperature  is  still  hot,  quite 
strong weld line will be formed and remain as strong as the bulk. 
iii)  Projected area on the plane B=6x10 – 3.14(1.5)2= 52.9 mm2  (it´s the same for C),  
Clamping force is F=6000 x 52.9/(25.4)2= 492 lbs = 0.5 ton 

Problem 3: 

The  following  pictures  show  one  half  of  an  injection  molded  housing.  With  the  basic 
design  rules  for  injection  molding  in  mind,  is  this  a  good  design?  Explain  why/why  not 
and  suggest  any  improvements  you  might  want  to  make.  If  you  would  like  to,  you  can 
make a sketch to explain your thoughts. 

Solution 
Injection Molding Design Guidelines 
Much has been written regarding design guidelines for injection molding. Yet, the design 
guidelines can be summed up in just a few design rules.  
•	 Use  uniform  wall  thicknesses  throughout  the  part.  This  will  minimize  sinking, 
warping, residual stresses, and improve mold fill and cycle times. 
•	 Use generous radius at all corners. The inside corner radius should be a minimum of 
one material thickness. 
•	 Use  the  least  thickness  compliant  with  the  process,  material,  or  product  design 
requirements.  Using  the  least  wall  thickness  for  the  process  ensures  rapid  cooling, 
short  cycle  times,  and  minimum  shot  weight.  All  these  result  in  the  least  possible 
part cost. 

•	 Design  parts  to  facilitate  easy withdrawal  from  the mold  by  providing  draft  (taper) 
in the direction of mold opening or closing.  
•	 Use ribs or gussets to improve part stiffness in bending. This avoids the use of thick 
section to achieve the same, thereby saving on part weight, material costs, and cycle 
time costs. 
For the case of figure 2/3, the points to note are the radii (missing!) and thickness (not 
uniform!). Also, on closer inspection a draft angle is missing. 

o	

a)	 Radii 
o	 Sharp  corners  greatly  increase  the  stress  concentration.  This  high  amount 
of stress concentration can often lead to failure of plastic parts.  
o	 Sharp corners can come about in non-obvious places. Examples of this are 
a  boss  attached  to  a  surface,  or  a  strengthening  rib. These  corners  need  to 
be  radiused  just  like  all  other  corners.  The  stress  concentration  factor 
varies with radius, for a given thickness. 
In  addition  to  reducing  stresses,  fillet  radiuses  provide  streamlined  flow 
paths for the molten plastic resulting in easier fills.  

b)  Thickness 

o	 Parts  should  have  a  uniform  wall  thickness.  Thick  sections  cool  slower 
than  thin  sections. The  thin  section  first  solidifies,  and  the  thick  section  is 
still  not  fully  solidified.  As  the  thick  section  cools,  it  shrinks  and  the 
material  for  the  shrinkage  comes  only  from  the  unsolidified  areas,  which 
are connected, to the already solidified thin section. 
o	 Parts  should  be  designed  with  a  minimum  wall  thickness  consistent  with 
part  function  and  mold  filling  considerations.  The  thinner  the  wall  the 
faster  the  part  cools,  and  the  cycle  times  are  short,  resulting  in  the  lowest 
possible part costs. 
o	 Also,  thinner  parts  weight  less,  which  results  in  smaller  amounts  of  the 
plastic used per part which also results in lower part costs.  
o	 This  builds  stresses  near  the  boundary  of  the  thin  section  to  thick  section. 
Since  the  thin  section  does  not  yield  because  it  is  solid,  the  thick  section 
(which is still liquid) must yield. Often this leads to warping or twisting. If 
this is severe enough, the part could even crack. 
c)	 Draft angle 
o	 Drafts  (or  taper)  in  a  mold,  facilitates  part  removal  from  the  mold.  The 
amount of draft angle depends on the depth of the part in the mold, and its 
required end use function.  
o	 The  draft  is  in  the  offset  angle  in  a  direction  parallel  to  the mold  opening 
and closing. 

Problem 4: 

You  are  going  to  make  tools  for  your  Yo-Yo  in  two  weeks.  You  should  define  your 
functional  requirements  first  before  you  seek  design  parameters,  which  meet  the 
requirements.  Please  define  the  functional  requirements  of  your  own  Yo-Yo  and  try  to 
find  design  parameters  that  fulfill  those  requirements.  Show  the  mapping  process  in-
between  “What”  and  “How”  at  the  top  two  levels.  This  is  not  a  single  solution  problem. 
In  the  world  of  design,  you,  as  a  designer,  have  all  the  power  to  explore  any  possible 
design  (at  least  until  it  is  proven  to  be  a  poor  one).  Feel  free  to  sketch  your  design  on  a 
piece of paper. 

Solution 
This  is  a  progressive  type  problem  you will  find  your  own  solution  during  the  course  of 
2.008  laboratory  sessions.  Discuss  you  design  with  your  lab  group  members  before  the 
lab session IV and try to synthesize a better design solution for your group’s Yo-Yo. 

The  following  paragraph  gives  an  overview  of  how  your  functional  requirements, 
manufacturing restrictions and design parameters might look like. 

Functional requirements (FR) 
o	 FR1: playability (the yo-yo has to work in the end) 
o	 FR2: additional requirements set up by your group (e.g. exchangeable parts, looks 
cool, good lab grade with nice presentation, etc.) 
o	 FR3: pass drop test could be another FR for your Yo-Yo 
o	 Remember  that  the functional requirements are  the WHAT you want  the yo-yo  to 
accomplish.    “Has  a  radio  tracking device  embedded  in  it”  is a design parameter; 
“ Is easy to find” would be the functional requirement. 

Design parameters (DP) 
o	 Top level 
To  meet  FR1,  you  need  to  have  a  DP1:  the  device  should  look  like  a  Yo-Yo  (a 
rounded  mass  around  the  rim  to  transform  potential  energy  to  rotational  energy, 
and vice versa).  If you have additional FR,  for example “FR2: Easy  to  find”, you 
need  to  find  a  solution  to  meet  the  FR2  such  as,  DP2:  Embedded  radio  tracking 
device. DP3 for FR3 could be a rigid design with no thin parts sticking out. 

Since you are supposed to make your product with the processes available at the shop, we 
need to think about the mapping process between DP domain and Process Domain. 
o	 2nd level 
To  meet  DP1  in  the  process  domain,  PV1  should  be  moldability  of  your  DP1. 
PV2  may  be  the  possibility  to  integrate  the  radio  device  into  your  Yo-Yo.  Since 
we  don’t  have  a  detailed  design  yet,  we  cannot  go  further  down  at  this  process 
domain and need to go back to the FR domain one level down (zig-zagging). 

For  a  given  DP1  and  PV1,  FR1  needs  to  be  further  broken  down  to  fulfill  what 
you  want.  You  may  need  to  have  a  bigger  rotational  moment  of  inertia  (more 
weight  into  the  rim of  the  yo-yo  (FR11), which will  conserve more  energy while 
rotating), to have a bigger radius of rotation for the string windings (FR12), a nice 
fit  to  average  size  hands  either  for  lefty  and  righty  (FR13),  safety  for  young  kids 
(FR14), etc.  (These may differ  for each designer.) FR31 might be  that  the Yo-Yo 
doesn´t  fall apart when dropped  by a certain distance, FR 32  that  it doesn´t break 
when dropped. 

DP11 may be the cross sectional shape of the Yo-Yo. DP12: Gap for string (about 
1.5 of the  string diameter.), DP13: Outer dimension of Yo-Yo.  (look,  this will be 
constrained by  the machine  and mold  size, when you map  this one  to  the process 
domain.)  DP14:  Kind  of  plastic  material  or  non-sharp  edges.  When  you  map 
between  DP’s  to  PV’s,  the  design  for  injection  molding  needs  to  be  considered, 
such  as;  thinnest possible uniform  thickness, etc. DP31  can be  the overlapping of 
the different parts, DP32 the wall thickness or the inclusion of ribs. 

If you  have FR2  in  your  design,  you  then  need  to map  between FR2  and DP2 by 
defining children of FR2 for a chosen DP2.
