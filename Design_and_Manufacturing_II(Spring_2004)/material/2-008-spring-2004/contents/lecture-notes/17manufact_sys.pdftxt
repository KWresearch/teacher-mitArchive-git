Production Rates (cont’d) 

•  Production rate increases if: 
– Increase the rate of the slowest machine 
– Reduce the disruptions 
– Introduce “buffers” 
– Introduce in-process control

•  It costs money 
•  It gets damaged 
•  It becomes obsolete 
•  It shrinks

Cycle Time 

Cycle Time (cont’d) 

“Cycle Time” 
•  The time a part spends in the system 

• Example:  
Operation time = 1, One-piece operation 

Little’s Law: L = λw 
L: average inventory 
λ: average production rate 
w: average cycle time
