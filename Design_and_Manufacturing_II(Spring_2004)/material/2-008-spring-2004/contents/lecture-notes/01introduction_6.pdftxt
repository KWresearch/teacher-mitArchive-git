Manufacturing Industries

 The transition from an agrarian society of the 1700s to an industrial 
society of 1900s resulted in the industrialization of agriculture and 
not its disappearance.
 Today, only 3% of Americans are engaged in agricultural activities 
in contrast to 90% of the workforce in the 1700s.

 The Ford Motor Co. has been the most studied and 
documented car manufacturing enterprise. 
 The 1909 Model T car was easy to operate and maintain. 
 By 1920, Ford was building half 
the cars in the world 
(more than 500K per year).
