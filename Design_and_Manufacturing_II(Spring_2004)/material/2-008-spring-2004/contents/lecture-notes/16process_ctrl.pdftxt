Variation: Common and

Pieces vary from each other:

But they form a pattern that, if stable, is called a distribution:

If only common causes of variation are present, 
the output of a process forms a distribution that is

Central Limit Theorem

• 

• 

A large number of independent 
events have a continuous probability 
density function that is normal in 
shape. 
i
Averag ng more samples increases 
the precision of the estimate of the

• 
Quantify common cause var ation; take act on on the system. 

These three phases are repeated for continuing process improvement. 

Idea: Points outside the limits will signal that something is wrong-
an assignable cause.  We want limits set so that assignable causes 
are highlighted, but few random causes are highlighted 
accidentally. 

Convention for Control Charts: 
• Upper control limit (UCL) =   x  + 3σsg 

• Lower control limit (LCL) =  x - 3σsg 

(Where σsg represents the standard deviation of a subgroup of samples)

Setting the Limits (cont’d) 

Benefits of Control Charts 

Convention for Control Charts (cont’d): 

σsub group = σsg ≠ σprocess 

subgroup  = σprocess/√n 
σ
UCL =  x  + 3σ /√n 
process
LCL = x  - 3σprocess/√n 

As n increases, the UCL and LCL move closer to the center line, 
making the control chart more sensitive to shifts in the mean. 

Properly used, control charts can: 
•	 Be used by operators for ongoing control of a process 
•	 Help the process perform consistently, predictably, for quality and 
cost 
•	 Allow the process to achieve: 
–  Higher quality 
–  Lower unit cost 
–  Higher effective capacity 
•	 Provide a common language for discussing process performance 
•	 Distinguish special from common causes of variation; as a guide 
to local or management action

•	 Take an example with: 
Mean = .738

Standard deviation, σ = .0725

UCL = 0.900

LCL = 0.500

•	 Normalizing the specifications: 
0.900 − 0.738

0.500 − 0.738

proportions out of specification would be: 
PUCL= 0.0129

P
LCL  = 0.0005

total  = 0.0134

•	 The Capability Index would be:

CPK  = Zm in/3 = 2.23 / 3 = 0.74

If this process could be adjusted toward the center of the 
specification, the proportion of parts falling beyond either 
or both specification limits might be reduced, even with no 
change in Standard deviation.

mean = 0.700, then:

Improving Process Capability 

•	 To improve the chronic performance of the 
process, concentrate on the common causes 
that affect all periods.  These will usually require 
management action on the system to correct. 

•	 Chart and analyze the revised process: 
–	 Confirm the effectiveness of the system by continued 
monitoring of the Control Chart
