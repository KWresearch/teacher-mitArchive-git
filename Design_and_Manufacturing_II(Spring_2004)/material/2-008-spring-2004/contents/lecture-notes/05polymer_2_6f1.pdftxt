Injection Molding

What is a mold?
From Webster: a cavity in which a substance is shaped: as (1) : a matrix for casting metal 
(2) : a form in which food is given a decorative shape 

-Net shape manufacturing
-Volume vs. cost
-Life of a mold

Flashes

Flashes  develop  at  the  mold  parting  line  or  ejector  pin  installation  point.  It  is  a 
phenomenon where molten polymer smears out and sticks to the gap.
Cause
Poor quality of the mold. The molten polymer has too low viscosity. 
Injection pressure is too high, or clamping force is too weak.

Solution
Avoiding excessive difference in thickness is most effective.
Slow down the injection speed.
Apply  well-balanced  pressure  to  the  mold  to  get  consistent  clamping  force,  or 
increase the clamping force.
Enhance the surface quality of the parting lines, ejector pins and holes.

Short shot
This  is  the  phenomenon  where  molten  plastics  does  not  fill  the  mold  cavity 
completely. and the portion of parts becomes incomplete shape.
Cause
The shot volume or injection pressure is not sufficient. 
Injection  speed  is  so  slow  that  the  molten  plastics  becomes  solid  before  it 
flows to the end of the mold.
Solution
Apply higher injection pressure. Install air vent or degassing device. Change 
the shape of the mold or gate position for better flow of the plastics.

Flow path ratio
-Flow path ratio is the ratio between L (the distance between the gate and 
the farthest point in the molding dimension) and T (the thickness of the 
part) .
-When molding large or thin parts, the flow path ratio is calculated to 
determine if molten plastics can fill the mold cavity.
L/T = 280-100 
Polyethylene (PE) 
Polypropylene (PP) 
L/T = 280-150 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)  L/T = 280-70 
L/T = 300-220 
Polystyrene (PS) 
Polycarbonate (PC) 
L/T = 160-90
Acrylonitrile butadienstylene 
L/T = 280-120 
(ABS) 
Polyamide (PA) 
L/T = 320-200

Mold Temperature Control
• Mold Temperature Control
– Mold cooling with water, oil.
– Hot mold for less residual stresses (orientation)
• Low thermal inertia
– Uneven cooling
• warpage, twisting, shrinkage defects
• Shrinkage can progress for up to 30 days.

Mold cooling
Molding cycle can be shortened by reducing time for cooling and 
solidification of molten plastics. 
Solidification time, t       thickness2/α,    thermal diffusitivity
Warpage or stress in a part can be generated when mold shrinkage 
varies due to different thickness, leading internal residual stress 
difference. 
Even cooling

Warpage

This deformation appears when the part is removed from the mold and 
pressure is released.

Cause
Uneven shrinkage due to the mold temperature difference (surface
temperature difference at cavity and core), and the thickness difference in 
the part. Injection pressure was too low and insufficient packing.

Solution
Take a longer cooling time and lower the ejection speed. Adjust the ejector 
pin position or enlarge the draft angle. Examine the part thickness or 
dimension. Balance cooling lines. Increase packing pressure.

Pressure Control

Pressure Control

• pressure distribution
• Injection unit
– Initial injection pressure
• Applied to the molten plastic and resulting from the main 
hydraulic pressure pushing against the back end of the 
injection screw (or plunger). 
– Packing pressure
– Injection Pressure inside mold
• Usually 1,000 psi to 5,000 psi
• Lower than hold and pack pressure between 10,000psi and 
20,000 psi

End of filling

Pressure Control
– Hold pressure (packing)
• Compensate shrinkage
• Rule of thumb: Hold pressure = 150% of injection 
pressure.
• Applied at the end of the initial injection stroke, and is 
intended to complete the final filling of the mold and 
hold pressure till gate closure

Clamp force

• Pressure Required
– Total force = projected area times injection pressure (A X P)
– Rule of thumb 4 to 5 tons/in2 can be used for most plastics.
– Example,
• Part is 10 in by 10 in by 1 in
• Projected area = Surface area = 10 in x 10 in = 100 in2 
• Injection Pressure = 15,000 psi for PC
• Tonnage required to keep mold closed is 
– 100 in2  x 15,000 psi= 1,500,000 lbs = 750 tons  (note : 2000 
lbs = 1 ton)

Mold Structure - Cavity and core

Mold Structure: Parting line
A dividing line between a cavity plate and a core plate of a
mold.
- Make a parting line on a flat or simple-curved surface so that 
flash cannot be generated.
- Venting gas or air.

Delivery 

Sprue 
A sprue is a channel through which to 
transfer molten plastics injected from the 
injector nozzle into the mold. 

Runner
A runner is a channel that guides molten 
plastics into the cavity of a mold. 

Gate
A gate is an entrance through which 
molten plastics enters the cavity.

- Longer cooling time, more material, cost
- Too small
- short shot, sink mark, bad quality
- Too long
- pressure drop, waste, cooling

Gate
-Restricts the flow and the direction of molten 
plastics. 
-Quickly cools and solidifies to avoid backflow 
after molten plastics has filled up in the cavity.
-Simplifies cutting of a runner and moldings to 
simple finishing of parts.

Gate Positioning

Point 1: Set a gate position where molten plastics finish filling up 
in each cavity simultaneously. Same as multiple points gate. 
Point 2: Basically set a gate position to the thickest area of a part. 
This can avoid sink marks due to molding (part) shrinkage . 
Point 3: Set a gate position to an unexposed area of part or where 
finishing process can be easily done. 
Point 4: Consider degasing, weldline, molecular orientation.
Point5: Fill up molten plastics using the wall surface in order not to 
generate jetting.

Whitening

Weldline

After the ejection by the ejector pin, the surface of the ejected part or 
surrounding part turns white. When some portion of the part is hard to remove 
from the mold, that portion also turns white. 

Cause
The part was hard to remove from the mold. Poor quality of the mold surface

Solution
Polish the mold well to facilitate removal of the part. Lower the injection 
pressure to facilitate removal of the part Reduce the ejector pin speed, and 
increase the number of ejector pins.

This  is  a  phenomenon  where  a  thin  line  is  created  when  different flows  of 
molten plastics  in  a mold  cavity meet  and  remain undissolved.  It  is  a  boundary 
between  flows  caused  by  incomplete  dissolution  of  molten  plastics.  It  often 
develops around the far edge of the gate.
Cause
Low  temperature  of  the  mold  causes  incomplete  dissolution  of  the molten 
plastics.

Solution
Increase  injection  speed  and  raise  the  mold  temperature.  Lower  the  molten 
plastics  temperature  and  increase  the  injection  pressure.  Change the  gate 
position  and  the  flow  of  molten  plastics.  Change  the  gate  position  to  prevent 
development of weldline.

Jetting
This is the phenomenon where the part has a wire-shape flow pattern on the 
surface.
Cause
Due to  inappropriate gate position, a flow of molten plastics  into  the cavity  is 
cooled  in  a  line  shape  and  remains undissolved with  other  plastics  flow 
coming later.
Solution
Raise the molten plastics and mold temperature, and increase injection 
speed to make the initial and later flows of molten plastics dissolve 
completely. Change the gate position to make the molten plastics touch the 
facing side before making a line shape.

Die swell > Thickness, t

Flow mark

This is a phenomenon where the  initial flow of molten plastics which solidifies 
mixes  with  a  later  flow  and  remains undissolved.  It  develops  distinctive 
patterns such as clouds, scales or tree rings.
Cause
Injection speed is too fast.
Mold or molten plastics temperature is too low.
Solution
Enlarge  the  gate  area  to  decrease  the  speed  of  the  molten  plastics  flowing 
through the gate.
Increase the pressure retention time for better pressure quality.
