Deforming 

~ 

= Over large volume 

Force 
Machining: 

~ 

~10s - 100s of lbs 

~  Stamping: 

~10s - 100s of tons 

Materials  - Virtually all ductile materials 

Shapes 

- Limited by strain/flow 

Size 

- Limited by force/equipment 

Advantages and disadvantages 
Advantages 
Parallel process: rapid bulk formation 

~ 

Important physics 
Stress/strain 
Affect CQFR 

~ 

Overall material properties improved 

~ 

Affect deforming force -> equipment & energy requirements 

~ 

Disadvantages 
Cost of equipment and dies 

~ 

Limited flexibility in shapes and sizes (i.e. compared to machining

) 

~ 

Accuracy 

~ 

Repeatability 

~ 

Friction 
Affect on deforming force -> equipment & energy requirements 

~ 

Why lubrication is needed and can help 

~ 

Friction is not repeatable… quality….

Now use Taylor’s series expansion (3 terms) to approximate the exponential function
