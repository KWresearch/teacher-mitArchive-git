Gate
-Restricts the flow and the direction of molten 
plastics. 
-Quickly cools and solidifies to avoid backflow 
after molten plastics has filled up in the cavity.
-Simplifies cutting of a runner and moldings to 
simple finishing of parts. 

Side gate

Submarine gate

Gate Positioning
Point 1: Set a gate position where molten plastics finish filling up 
in each cavity simultaneously. Same as multiple points gate. 
Point 2: Basically set a gate position to the thickest area of a part. 
This can avoid sink marks due to molding (part) shrinkage . 
Point 3: Set a gate position to an unexposed area of part or where 
finishing process can be easily done. 
Point 4: Consider degasing, weldline, molecular orientation.
Point5: Fill up molten plastics using the wall surface in order not to 
generate jetting.

Defects
Molding defects are caused by related and complicated 
reasons as follows:

* Malfunctions of molding machine
* Inappropriate molding conditions
* Bad product and mold design
* Improper Selection of molding material

Weldline

It  is a  boundary between  flows  caused by  incomplete  fusion of molten  plastics. 
It often develops around the far edge of the gate.
Cause
Low  temperature  of  the  mold  causes  incomplete  dissolution  of  the molten 
plastics.

Solution
Increase  injection  speed  and  raise  the  mold  temperature.  Increase  the  melt 
temperature  and  increase  the  injection  pressure.  Change  the  gate position  to 
prevent development of weldline at high stress area.

Jetting
This  is  the phenomenon where  the part has a  toothpaste  flow pattern on  the 
surface.
Cause
Due to  inappropriate gate position, a flow of molten plastics  into  the cavity  is 
cooled  in  a  line  shape  and  remains  unfused with  other  plastics  flow  coming 
later.
Solution
Change the gate position to make the molten plastics touch the facing side 
before making a line shape.

Die swell

(cid:132) die imparts shape on the material, e.g., rod, tube, sheet, 
channel
(cid:132) exit material is called extrudate

the polymer flow, called die swell

Venting, degassing

This is a phenomenon where the  initial flow of molten plastics which solidifies 
mixes  with  a  later  flow  and  remains undissolved.  It  develops  distinctive 
patterns such as clouds, scales or tree rings.
Cause
Injection speed is too fast.
Mold or molten plastics temperature is too low.
Solution
Enlarge  the  gate  area  to  decrease  the  speed  of  the  molten  plastics  flowing 
through the gate.
Increase the pressure retention time for better pressure quality.

Injection Molded Part Design

(cid:132) Base feature + 2ndary feature (ribs, bosses, holes, 
etc.)
(cid:132) Nominal wall : Keep part thickness as thin and 
uniform as possible.
(cid:132) shorten the cycle time, improve dimensional stability, 
and eliminate surface defects. 
(cid:132) For greater stiffness, reduce the spacing between ribs, 
or add more ribs. 
(cid:132) Nominal wall thickness should be within +/- 10%

Uniform cooling

(cid:132) Differential cooling, differences in shrinkage by 
different thickness is a leading cause of warpage, 
sinks, and voids.

Rib, Boss Design Parameters.

Design rules

(cid:132) Sink mark, Filling difficulty
(cid:132) Ribs should be tapered (drafted) at one degree per side. 
(cid:132) The draft will increase the rib thickness from the tip to the root.
(cid:132) The typical root thickness ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 times the base     
thickness.
(cid:132) Ribs aligned in the direction of the mold opening.
(cid:132) A boss should not be placed next to a parallel wall; instead, offset 
the boss and use gussets to strengthen it. 
(cid:132) Gussets can be used to support bosses that are away from the 
walls. 
(cid:132) Ribs can take the shape of corrugations. (honeycomb)

Additives cost, e.g., colorants, fillers, stabilizers, etc. 
(cid:132) Material Cost = (resin cost)*(resin fraction) + 
(additives cost)* (additives fraction)
(cid:132) Total Material cost=(part weight +scrap %) x $/lbs 
Scraps from runners, sprues, and part rejects
(cid:132) Labor rate=labor cost ($/hr)/(part cycles x #of cavities)
(cid:132) Variable cost=raw material+labor rate

(cid:132) Fixed cost = Engineering cost+Mold cost +Machine 
cost+ space

Reaction Injection Molding 
(RIM)

Advantages
-As this molding requires lower pressure 
than regular injection molding, an 
aluminum or fiber mold can be used. 
(RRIM)
- Molding large sizes and complicated 
shapes is possible. (near 100% car 
bumpers)

Disadvantages
-A copolymerization generates gas, 
which compresses the air left in the mold 
and is likely to cause burns.
- Molding cycle is extended.

Polyol + Diisocyanate

Polyurethane

Vacuum (Thermo) forming
-Soften a sheet of thermoplastics 
molding material with a heater. 
- Suck the air out of the mold 
through the vent hole to form a 
vacuum, causing the molding 
material to conform to the mold and 
assume its shape. 
- Allow air in again to remove the 
part.

Blow molding

-Pinch a part of a molding material that has 
been molded into a tube shape with a separate 
mold. 
- Blow compressed air into the molding 
material, causing it to expand until it conforms 
to the shape mold to mold the part.

Extrusion blow molding

Extrusion blow molding
(cid:132) Extrusion Blow Molding the parison is formed from an extrusion 
die that is similar to one from blown film.
(cid:132) Extrusion blow molding is discrete. Each part is molded 
individually.
Injection blow molding
(cid:132) A parison can have a non-constant cross-section resulting in 
better wall thickness uniformity than from extrusion blow 
molding.
(cid:132) Parisons can be made by injection and then either stored until 
the finished blow molded parts are needed or shipped to a 
satellite location where they can be blown.(cid:198) shipping cost
Just oven and a blowing station at the bottling site.
