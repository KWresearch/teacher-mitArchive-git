OBJECTIVE 
 
These  lab  exercises  will  introduce  you  to  process  planning  and  the  tools  you  will  need  to  carry  through  on  such  a 
plan.    In  the  end  (lab  III)  you  will  produce  a  machined  paperweight  with  your  own  unique  inscription.    You  will 
become familiar with a CNC lathe and a CNC mill, as well as Mastercam, a computer-aided manufacturing software 
package.  You will also learn G-code, the alphanumeric programming language used to control CNC machine tools. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
Process  planning  is  an  engineering  activity  that  determines  the  appropriate  procedures  for  transforming  raw 
materials  into  a  final  product  as  specified  by  an  engineering  design.    Engineering  designs  are  conventionally 
documented  using  detailed  diagrams  indicating  important  design  characteristics  such  as  dimensions,  tolerances, 
materials,  and  other  pertinent  specifications.    Even  though  these  diagrams  convey  a  large  amount  of  information 
about  a  design,  they  are  incomplete  in  that  they  do  not  describe  the  manufacturing  steps  necessary  to  produce  the 
final  part.    Effective  process  plans  provide  this  information.    In  practice,  design,  process  planning,  and 
manufacturing  are  interrelated  since  the  capabilities  and  characteristics  of  available  equipment,  manufacturing 
processes, and personnel can have a significant impact on the final design of a product. 

G-code 
 
When  the  designed  product  is  produced  using  CNC  machine  tools,  the  machine  tool  controller  needs  explicit 
instructions  describing  the  type  and  order  of  individual  steps  required  to  perform  a  given  task.    These  instructions 
are provided  to  the controller  in  the form of alphanumeric codes (G-code) and are usually called a part program.   A 
complete listing of G-code commands and a set of example code/part pairs can be found in the appendices. 
 
G-code itself can be written with any number of text editors, including the Windows notepad and, of course, emacs.  
After the code is verified with a simulation, it is loaded into one of the CNC machines. 

Mastercam 
 
Mastercam is a commercial Computer Aided Manufacturing software package.   CAM is the process that links CAD 
(computer-aided  design)  with  machine  tools  by  automatically  producing  CNC  code  from  a  drawing.    Mastercam 
includes  a  CAD  environment,  a  geometry-to-G-code  translator,  and  a  G-code  simulator.    It  is  possible  to  import 
geometry from other drawing tools like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, or Pro/ENGINEER.

LAB EXERCISES 
 
In  the  next  two  labs,  you  will  obtain  an  aluminum  disc  3”  in  diameter  and  .5”  thick  (Fig.  1).  Inscribe  your  own 
unique  pattern  on  the  top  with  the  CNC  milling  machine  (Fig.  2),  and  turn  a  custom  border/facial  profile  on  the 
remainder of the disk with the CNC lathe (Fig. 3). 
 
All  exercises  will  be  conducted  with  a  partner  -  each  pair  must  turn  in  only  one  part  and  will  receive  a  common 
grade.1   You  and your  lab mate may need  to meet outside of  class  in order  to  complete  some of  these  assignments.  
If  you  are  feeling  adventurous,  you  and  your  lab  mate  may  produce  two  different  paperweights.    They  will  be 
graded separately.

DELIVERABLES 
 
This page explains what you must have completed by a week after each  lab session.   See  the "Grading Procedures" 
section of the webpage for more details. 
 
DELIVERABLE - Lab I 
 
1)  A  2-D  drawing  of  the  inscription  to  be machined on  the  top of your paperweight.   This  should be  either hand-
drawn on graph paper or computer-drawn and dimensioned.  
2)  A handwritten G-code program of your unique inscription.  A Mastercam Mill generated program is cheating! 
3) 
 A  separate detailed cross-sectional  sketch of  the side view showing  the profile shape  that will be machined on 
the lathe.  This should also be properly dimensioned and neat.   

 
Things to think about: 
 
•  You should have  the handwritten program on a 3.5” floppy, or a Zip disk, (100MB, or 250MB) if you work on 
it at home so that you will be ready to debug and run at the beginning of Lab III. 
•  The program should be typed in using Windows Notepad.  It must have a filename extension “.txt”. 
•  Keep  in mind  that your  inscription should fit within a 2.0” diameter circle to allow for machining of the profile 
on the perimeter. 
•  Your milled inscription and profile shape must be unique. 
•  When dimensioning, be sure to reference everything from the center and top of the disk. 
•  Don’t forget Z depths! 
•  Your inscription must have at least one arc or circle - all straight lines are not allowed. 
•  Remember  the  diameter  of  the  end  mill  (it  must  fit  between  features)  before  you  try  anything  too  fine  and 
detailed. 
•  Remember  to  consider  how  the  disk  will  be  held  in  the  chuck  on  the  lathe  so  that  you  don't  machine  into  the 
jaws of the chuck - leave at least .200” of uncut material at the bottom. 
•  Remember to consider the shape of the bit and the angle from which it will cut. 
•  An isometric view of your part is purely optional. 
 
DELIVERABLE - Lab II 
 
1)  Finalized handwritten G-code for mill. 
2)  Mastercam generated lathe toolpath for the profile view. 
  
 
DELIVERABLE - Lab III 
 
1)  A completed paperweight, with both the milled inscription and turned profile. 
2)  A hardcopy of the final handwritten program of the milled inscription if it was changed since Lab II. 
3)  A Mastercam drawing of the final output of the entire paperweight, with both the top view and the side view on 
the same drawing, completely dimensioned.

APPENDIX A: Producing the Sample Part 
 
Step I: Milled Inscription 
 

 

 
In this example the Z0 has been established below the top of the raw stock by .010”.  The first tool in the program is 
a 1.5” diameter end mill (T11) that will face off the top of the raw stock to establish a plane at Z0.  It will remove all 
imperfections  from  the  original  rough  surface  to  create  a  uniform  flat  surface  parallel  to  the  machine’s  X,  and  Y 
planes.  It is important to note that the parallelism of the surface to the machine’s axes is critical for the engraving to 
be uniform  in depth and width of cut.   The engraving  tool  (T14)  is  then used  to engrave  the  letters “KC” at a depth 
of -.007” into the face, followed by a 1/4” ball end mill (T8) to machine a circular groove around the letters “KC”. 
 
The following is the program.  The 2nd column is only to describe what each line, or “block” is doing and is not used 
by the control on the machine.

APPENDIX B: Programming Machine Tools 
 
A part program is composed of a number of machine tool instructions.  These instructions can be commands to: turn 
the  spindle  on,  move  on  an  axis,  turn  the  coolant  on,  select  a  tool,  or  execute  an  entire  pattern  of  movements.    A 
letter  followed by digits  is called a  ‘word’ and each program  line  is  termed a  ‘block’.   The commands are executed 
in order, one ‘block’ at a time. 
 
Machine  tool  programming  began  from  a  common  starting  point.  The  current  common  character  set  derives  from 
the  first  standard NC machining  data  communication  standard  –  one-inch wide paper  tape.    In  this  standard,  letters 
are used to define specific program elements: 
 
Address   
 
O 
N 
 
G 
 
X, Y, Z   
 
R 
I 
 
 
Due to the power and frequent use of the preparatory functions, CNC control programs are often called G-code. 
 
Logically, different types of machines require different G-code programs.   A lathe has different requirements than a 
mill  or  a  grinder.    In  addition,  as  products  have  become  more  advanced  and  manufacturers  have  wished  to 
differentiate  their  products  from  their  competitors,  custom  commands have proliferated  and made  certain programs 
incompatible  with  different  machines.    It  is  therefore  important  to  learn  which  codes  are  available  on  which 
machines.

The computers are networked to the ME server in bldg. 3.  Please note that Mastercam writes to C:\temp on 
the  local  hard  drives.    You  must  Copy  your  geometry  file  “.MC9”,  and  part  program  file  “.TXT”  for  the  EZ-Trak 
mills,  or  “.NC”  for  the  lathe,  to  your  assigned  lab  folder  on  the  server,  they  are  safer  there  and  you will  be  able  to 
access them from any computer in the lab next time you come in, and others in your work group will be able to find 
them  as well.    The  computers  also  have  250MB  Zip  drives  and will  recognize  100MB  Zip  disks.   Make  sure  you 
save  your  work  over  the  network!    The  computers  are  set  to  automatically  log  you  off  after  15  minutes  of 
inactivity.    This  time  period  may  change  before  the  labs  begin.    This  automatic  logging  off  will  clean  the 
desktop,  and  the  temp  folder.    Please  keep  all  files  backed  up  on  a  floppy  disk,  or  Zip  disk.    You  may  create 
additional  folders within your  assigned  folder  to keep your  files organized.   Such  as  a  “Mill”  folder, and a “Lathe” 
folder,  with  sub-folders  under  each  such  as  MC9,  NC.    Refrain  from  saving  your  work  in  your  personal  network 
folder, others in your group will not be able to access the data.  Always work out of your assigned lab folder. 
 
There are 2 computers in the shop, Crossshop1 serves the lathe, and Crossshop2 serves the EZ-Trak. 
 
Send the Lathe programs to the appropriate folder within the ‘send’ folder on Crossshop1.
