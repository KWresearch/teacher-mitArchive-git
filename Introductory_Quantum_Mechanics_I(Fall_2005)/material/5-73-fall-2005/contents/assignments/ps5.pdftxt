5.73 Problem Set 5


1.  Consider a system that evolves under the Hamiltonian 
Hˆ	 =ωJˆ  . z 
y ( )t  and  Jˆ 
x ( )t 
z ( )t  given 
,  Jˆ 
Compute the average values  Jˆ 
fixed initial values for each average.  What is the vector

z (t )  k  doing?  What aspects of the 
y (t )  j +  Jˆ 
x (t )  i  +  Jˆ 
J  =  Jˆ 
evolution are quantum mechanical and what aspects are 
classical? 

2.  Consider a particle with the wavefunction: 
r,θ ,φψ  = N R (r )(1 − cos  θ)sin θ cos φ 
3 
where  N  is a normalization constant. 
a.  If one performs a measurement of  Lˆ 2 and  Lˆ 
z for this state, 
what are the possible outcomes? 
b.  The dipole moment operator is µˆ  = erˆ .  Does this state 
possess a dipole moment along the x, y or z directions?  You 
need not compute the values of the x, y or z components; 
merely determine if they are zero. 
c.	 What about the quadrupole moment  Mˆ  = e(3zˆ 2  − rˆ 2 )?  Is it 
non-zero? 

3.  The idea behind Lewis Dot Structures is that bonds are formed 
when two S=1/2 electrons from different atoms “pair” to form a 
state with Stot=0.  First, 
notice that for an isolated 
pair of electrons, this is 
accomplished by an 
“exchange” Hamiltonian 
Hˆ	 = JSˆ  ⋅ Sˆ 
j	
i
where  Sˆ  and  Sˆ  are the 
j 
i
spin operators of the two 
electrons and J  is a constant 
that determines the strength

In this problem, we will consider a Lewis-dot model of the 
bonding in cyclobutadiene.  We are only interested in the 4 π­
electrons, so we can write 
Hˆ  = JSˆ  ⋅ Sˆ  + J ' Sˆ  ⋅ Sˆ  + JSˆ  ⋅ Sˆ  + J ' Sˆ  ⋅ Sˆ

where, as the picture implies,  J ' ≥ J . 

a)  Compute the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of this 
Hamiltonian for  J  = 1 ,  J ' = 2 . 
b)  Compute the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of this 
Hamiltonian for  J  =  J ' = 3 / 2 . 
c)  Develop a measure for the “strength” of the bond and 
show that in a) the C1-C2  and C3-C4  bonds are weaker 
than the other two while in b) the bonds are all 
equivalent. 

4.	 Consider the low energy reaction of atomic hydrogen with 
singlet oxygen to yield hydroxyl radical and atomic oxygen: 
* 
H·+O2 → [HO2 ·]→ ·OH+O: 
At low energy, the transition state complex [HO2 ·] has no 
rotational angular momentum.  Given that the H atom is spin­
* 
1/2, O2  is spin-0, OH is spin-1/2, O is spin-1 and total angular 
momentum is conserved, what are the relative yields of O 
atoms with mS=+1,0,-1?  That is, will one of the mS  values be 
preferred over the others?  Would it be possible for the 
products to be OH(mS=+1/2)+O(mS=+1)? Why or why not? 

5.	 Consider an anharmonic potential of the form 
V (qˆ ) =  1

kqˆ	 −αqˆ  + βqˆ

use perturbation theory to compute the eigenvalues of this 
potential to lowest non-vanishing order in α and β . [Hint: the 
cubic and quartic terms will contribute at different orders] 
Express your result in the standard vibrational form: 
E (n ) = E0  +ω e (n + 2 ) −ω e xe (n + 2 )2  +ω e y e (n + 2 )3

Compare this result to the variational prediction you made in a 
previous problem set (which assumed the particular values 
α = .045 , β = .00107 ).  Is perturbation theory accurate for this 
potential?
