If we plot the eigenenergies (along with the diabatic states), we find:

Thus, there are two crossings in the diabatic picture (around R=±1.5) 
which turn into avoided crossings in the adiabatic picture.  Meanwhile, 
the diabatic coupling looks like: 

 
Clearly, the diabatic coupling is large near the two avoided crossings, 
indicating that the adiabatic states change rapidly around these points. 
 
 

 
2.  A Jahn-Teller distortion occurs when a molecule that would 
have a degenerate electronic configuration if the nuclei were 
arranged symmetrically instead distorts so that the electronic 
degeneracy is lifted and the energy is lowered.  This problem 
concerns a model of Jahn-Teller distortion.  Consider a system 
with two low-lying diabatic electronic states,  1  and  2 , and two 
vibrational modes,  x  and  y .  The Hamiltonian for this molecule 
is:

In this model, the origin (

symmetric configuration and the  x  and  y  modes correspond to 
vibrational motions that distort the molecule away from the  
symmetric geometry.  Note that the first and second diabatic 
states are degenerate, as advertised.

potential.  Express the result in terms of polar coordinates

describe a distorted molecule?  If so what is the

If you ask Mathematica to give you the eigenvectors of the 
potential matrix (and are careful to make sure they are 
normalized), you get the two states:

Both expressions are correct. However, the second set of 
states is the traditional choice because it makes the diagonal 
elements of the non-adiabatic coupling zero:

The first states are single-valued for all θθθθ while the second 
set acquires a “-“ sign on going from θθθθ to θ+2πθ+2πθ+2πθ+2π.  This minus 
sign problem occurs anytime there is a conical intersection.  
In order to have a single valued wavefunction overall, the 
extra phase in the adiabatic electronic wavefunction is 
exactly cancelled by an extra phase (of the opposite sign) in 
the nuclear part – the so-called “Berry’s phase”.  The extra 
phase required is different on the two different surfaces, 
and so for non-adiabatic processes the phase shows up as an 
experimentally observable interference pattern. 
 
To calculate the non-adiabatic coupling, we need

This can be computed in one of two ways; we can either re-
write the eigenvectors in terms of x and y and then compute

where it is important to note that this is still a vector, even 
though the ρρρρ component is zero.  The direction of the non-
adiabatic coupling tells us the direction along which the 
adiabatic wavefunction has its maximum rate of change.  In 
this case, the change is always in the θ θ θ θ direction, so the 
wavefunction changes as we circle around the origin.  At, 
the origin ρ=0ρ=0ρ=0ρ=0, and the non-adiabatic coupling is infinite.  
This reflects the fact that, for small ρρρρ, the adiabatic 
wavefunctions change rapidly as one makes a tiny circuit 
around the origin.  For example, for θ=0θ=0θ=0θ=0

Hence near the origin the adiabatic wavefunctions change 
infinitely rapidly and the non-adiabatic coupling blows up.  
This signals the catastrophic breakdown of the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation in this region.

Use the attached table to evaluate several values of the H-H 
bond length (R). Does MO theory obey the non-crossing rule?  
How can you justify your results?

That is, they include some average piece of the electron-
electron repulsion.  As a result, all the energies above are 
too high.  However, the no crossing rule is still obeyed (an 
would have been if we used the correct integrals, as well) 
and we see that the excited state dissociates to excited H-
atom fragments. We can see this from the wavefunction, 
because

So, the first excited singlet contains only ionic terms and 
dissociates exactly to H+ … H-.  You would have been able 
to tell this from the picture if I had given you the correct 
integrals.
