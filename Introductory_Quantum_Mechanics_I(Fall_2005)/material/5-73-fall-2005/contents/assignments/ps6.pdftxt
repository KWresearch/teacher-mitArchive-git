5.73 Problem Set 6 
Due: Monday, Nov. 28 2005 
 

1)  Consider a transition metal atom in the presence of a weak 
perturbing field due to the presence of some surrounding 
ligands.  Specifically, we will consider the situation where the 
metal atom is located at the origin and there are six identical 
ligands arranged at the positions  (
)a±,0,0
,  (
)0,
,0 a±
  and 
(
)0,0,a±
.  In this case we can approximate the perturbing 
potential by a “crystal field” potential of the form: 



(

α





where α is a constant that reflects the strength of the field 
exerted by the ligands.

a)  Re-express this potential in terms of the distance  r  from 
the nucleus of the transition metal and a sum of the

angular functions

b)  To first order, determine how this potential splits the 
degeneracy of the  d  orbitals of the transition metal atom.  
Are there any degeneracies that remain? You should not 
perform any radial integration at this step.  Why can you 
determine the relative splittings of the  d  orbitals without 
doing the radial integration?   

 
c)  Consider the spin-orbit interaction for an electron on the 
metal: 

 

SL ˆ
ˆ ⋅
= ζSOV
Assume the spin orbit interaction is much weaker than the 
crystal field.  To first order, how does this spin-orbit 
interaction split the degeneracy of the crystal field states?

d)  Now, assume that there are two non-interacting electrons 
in the   d  orbitals of this transition metal atom. In the 

presence of the crystal field (but neglecting spin-orbit 
0>α , what is the lowest 
interactions) and  assuming 
energy the two electrons can have? What is the 
degeneracy of this energy?  What are the possible

The position and momentum of electron 1 (2) will be denoted by
