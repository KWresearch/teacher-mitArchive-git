5.73 Problem Set 1 
Due Friday, Sept. 23 

1.  In class, we talked about linear polarization states.  Photons 
can also exist in either of two  possible circular polarization 
states (‘left ’ and ‘right ’) that can be written in terms of the 
familiar linear polarization states as: 
) 
1  ( x  +  y 
) 
1  ( x �  −  y 
�

a.  Show that these two states are orthonormal. 
b.  Given an arbitrary polarization state, 
�

�

ψ =  x a  +  y b

determine  a ' and  b ' such that:

ψ = a '
 L	 + b ' R 
Why can we do this? 
c.	 Write down the operators that correspond to left- and 
right-circular polarization filters.  Determine the probability 
that an x ’  -polarized photon will pass through a left circular 
polarization filter. 
d.  Consider the operators:

combinations: 1-2-3, 2-3-1 or 3-1-2.  Is there anything 
special about these combinations? 
e.  Can the polarization filter  ψ ψ  (with  ψ  defined in part 
b.) can be written as a linear combination of the  Ο

That is, can we find  ci ’ s so that:

This would mean that, just as any polarization state can 
be written in terms of a basis of states, so any polarization 
operator can be written in terms of an operator basis (in 
this case  ˆ  ). Ο

2.  Consider a molecule that can undergo two photon emission 
(TPE) from its excited state, emitting two photons with the same 
energy to return to its ground state.  After emission, denote the 
basis states of the two photons by: 
�

θ
k1 ,θ; k � 
2

�

where  ki  is the wavevector (direction of propagation) of photon 
i and θ
is its polarization. 
i
a.  If we work in the frame of the molecule, the total momentum 
of the system will be zero both before and after emission. 
�

What constraint does this place on the  ?ki 
b.  The polarization of the photon can be associated with an 
angular momentum, which must also be conserved.  Thus, if 
photon 1 is right polarized, photon 2 is left polarized.  Given 
this and the results of part a., write down a general 
expression for the state of the system after TPE, given that 
�

photon 1 is emitted in the  k  -direction. 
c.	 Now after the two photons have traversed a macroscopic 
distance (say, 1 meter), we want to perform an experiment 
on photon 2.  Determine the probability that photon 2 will 
pass through a left polarization filter. 
d.  Now, suppose we first measure the polarization of photon 1 
and determine that it is left polarized.  Then, what is the 
probability that photon 2 will pass through a left polarization 
filter? Is this disturbing?  Make sure to justify your answer 
using the rules discussed in class and/or bra-ket notation.
