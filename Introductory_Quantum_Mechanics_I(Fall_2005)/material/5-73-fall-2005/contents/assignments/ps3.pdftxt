All of these problems concern a particle in a delta function potential:

1.  First, let us look at the positive energy eigenstates of the delta 
function potential (repulsive or attractive).  Just as in the case 
of the step potential in class, we can write down the state of the 
system either to the left or right of the potential:

We need two equations to fix the eigenstate.  We obtain one by 
requiring the two wavefunctions to take on the same value at

What physical justification can we give for this discontinuity? 
2.  Now, let ’s consider the  repulsive case in particular.  Our 
experiment involves particles that are incident from the right on

case?  What are the possible values of  p  far from the 
barrier?

coefficients for this barrier as a function of  E .  Be careful
