β= .00107 .  Plot this potential and note any important 
features. 
c.	 Use DVR to determine the lowest 25 eigenvalues of this 
potential.  Note that you will probably need many more than 
25 states to ensure that the lowest 25 eigenvalues are 
accurate. 
d.  Determine which of the 25 eigenstates are located to the left 
and right of the barrier.  This may be done by examining 
appropriate average values (e.g.  ψ 
n q ˆ  ψ  , ψ 
n q  ψ  , etc.)

of the barrier? 
e.  Fit the energies of the lowest several states localized on the 
left  to a standard vibrational expansion:

What happens if you try to fit all 25 of the lowest states to 
this expansion? 

3.  This problem shows how more complicated (but still exactly 
solvable) problems often turn out to be the Harmonic Oscillator 
in disguise.  These ideas arise from a field called 
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Consider the generalized 
creation and destruction operators:

That is, show that  H ˆ  +  and  H ˆ  −  are of the same form, just 
with the parameters α , β , γ changed and a constant,  R , 
added.  This property is called shape invariance, and is 
crucial to determining the eigenvalues of  H ˆ  +  and  H ˆ  − . 
f.  Use the results of parts d. and e. to determine the lowest
