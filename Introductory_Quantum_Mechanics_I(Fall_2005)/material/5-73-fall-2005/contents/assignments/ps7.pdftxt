2.  A Jahn-Teller distortion occurs when a molecule that would 
have a degenerate electronic configuration if the nuclei were 
arranged symmetrically instead distorts so that the electronic 
degeneracy is lifted and the energy is lowered.  This problem 
concerns a model of Jahn-Teller distortion.  Consider a system 
with two low-lying diabatic electronic states,  1  and  2 , and two 
vibrational modes,  x  and  y .  The Hamiltonian for this molecule 
is:

In this model, the origin (
) corresponds to the 
x
symmetric configuration and the  x  and  y  modes correspond to 
vibrational motions that distort the molecule away from the  
symmetric geometry.  Note that the first and second diabatic 
states are degenerate, as advertised. 
 
 
a) Determine the adiabatic electronic energies of this 
potential.  Express the result in terms of polar coordinates 
θρcos→x
θρsin→y
 and 
.  Does this model properly 
describe a distorted molecule?  If so, what is the 
magnitude of the distortion (in terms of ω and  k )? What 
is the energy lowering due to the distortion?  What 
happens to the two surfaces at the symmetric geometry 
0=ρ )? 
(
b) Determine the adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer) 
electronic states. Use these states to compute the non-
adiabatic coupling.  Make sure to choose the relative 
phase of the two states so that the diagonal part of the

c) What happens to the nonadiabatic coupling at the 
symmetric geometry?  Note that the physical state of the 
molecule is the same at the polar points  (
)θρ,
 and 
(
)πθρ 2
, +
 since this just corresponds to a 360 degree 
rotation.  Show that the adiabatic wavefunctions at  (
)θρ,
and  (
)πθρ 2

 are not the same.  Could this have any 
experimental consequences?

Use the attached table to evaluate several values of the H-H 
bond length (R). Does MO theory obey the non-crossing rule?  
How can you justify your results?
