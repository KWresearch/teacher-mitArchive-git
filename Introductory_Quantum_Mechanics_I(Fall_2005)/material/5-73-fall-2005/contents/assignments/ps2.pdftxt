are the same. 

2.  Consider a operator,  O ˆ  , that depends on a parameter,  λ .  For 
example, the operator might be a Hamiltonian that depends on 
an electric field strength,  λ . 
a.  Consider the λ -dependent eigenvalue equation:

d λ 
eigenvalue without knowing the change in the eigenstate. 
Under what conditions would  O ˆ  (λ)  commute with  O ˆ  (λ ' ) ? 
b.  Now, consider the exponential of O ˆ  (λ) , which is defined 
through its power series:

We will later see that the exponential is closely related to 
time evolution in QM and here τ plays the role of time.

show that  [ O (λ) , e  λ τ  ) ] = 0 .

exponential with respect to the external parameter  λ .

Do not assume that O ˆ  (λ)  commutes with  O d  ˆ  (λ) / d λ . [Hint: 
Show that both sides ( X ˆ  ) satisfy the first order differential 
equation (in τ ):

Then, if the two sides are equal at τ= 0 , they must be 
equal for all τ .] 

3.  The following concern a diatomic molecule with a simple

( ˆ
harmonic potential between the atoms

�  = m = 1  and denote the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian by  n  . 
a.  Find the linear combination of  0	 and  1	 ( ϕ = a 0  + b 1  ) 
for which the average value of  x ˆ 
is maximum.  Repeat 
this process for a linear combination of  0	 and  2  .  What 
are the maximum values possible in each case?  Which 
works better? 
b.  Same as b., but this time maximize the average value of 
x ˆ 2 .  What conclusion do you draw from these two 
calculations? 
c.	 Now, assume that the molecule (starting in the vibrational 
and electronic ground state) is instantaneously promoted 
to an excited electronic state (say by a laser).  In this 
) =  1 kx ˆ 2  .  What 
( ˆ
state the potential felt by the atoms is 
x V

is the average energy of the atoms in the new state? 
Here, we are making use of the Franck-Condon 
approximation by assuming the electronic state adjusts 
much more quickly than the nuclei.

4.  For any one dimensional (1D) system, if we turn on a magnetic 
field of strength  B  perpendicular to the 1D axis, the resulting 
1D Hamiltonian is: 

= H ˆ  +  pB ˆ  . 
H ˆ 
B 
Assume that we have a harmonic oscillator of frequency ω and 
we subject it to a perpendicular magnetic field,  B . 
a.  What are the observable energies for the system now that 
the field is on?  You should determine these energies 
analytically (i.e. without assuming a numerical value for  B ). 
b.  We make a measurement of the energy and find a particular 
value  E  .  Next, we measure the momentum.  If we perform 
n 
this sequence of measurements many, many times (i.e. we 
measure the energy and find  E  and then measure the 
n 
momentum) what will be the average outcome?  Your 
expression should be correct for any choice of  B , n .[Hint: 
you should not need any explicit wavefunctions to do this.]
