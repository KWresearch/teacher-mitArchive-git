When dealing with two different sources of angular momentum,  Jˆ
1 
and  Jˆ 
2 , there are two obvious bases that one might choose to work 
in.  The first is called the uncoupled basis.  Here the basis kets are 
eigenstates of both operators: 
=  j  ( j  + 1)  j  , m1 ;  j2 , m2

In the case of spin orbit coupling, this would mean that our basis 
states would be simultaneous eigenfunctions of orbital and spin 
angular momentum, and each state would have a particular value for 
} and  m  .  Note that this is only possible if (as we assume): 
,{ m 
l
[J  , J 2 
] = 0
s 
1 
otherwise, the two operators would not have simultaneous 
ˆ  and  Sˆ  since the two 
eigenfunctions.  This is clearly true for  L 
operators act on different spaces. This really defines what we mean 
by different angular momenta, since operators that do not commute 
will, in some sense, define overlapping  –  and thus not completely 
forms of angular momentum. 
distinct – 

This basis is appropriate if  Jˆ
1  and  Jˆ 
2  do not interact.  However, when 
the Hamiltonian contains an interaction between these two angular 
(cid:215) Jˆ 
momenta (such as  Jˆ 
2 ), the eigenstates will be mixtures of the 
1 
uncoupled basis functions and this basis becomes somewhat 
awkward.  In these cases, it is easiest to work in the coupled basis, 
which we now develop. 

First, note that the total angular momentum is given by: 

ˆ
ˆ
J ˆ  = J ˆ 
+ J ˆ 
2 
1 
It is easy to show that this is, in fact, an angular momentum (i.e. 
[J  , J y 
] =  Ji 
ˆ 
).  W e can therefore associate two quantum numbers,  j
z 
x
and  m , with the eigenstates of total angular momentum indicating its 
magnitude and projection onto the z axis.  The coupled basis states 
are eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum operator.  This 
specifies two quantum numbers for our basis states (  j  and  m ). 
However, as we saw above, the uncoupled basis states were 
specified by four quantum numbers (  j ,  j2 , m1  and  m2 ) and we 
1 
therefore need to specify two more quantum numbers to fully specify 
the coupled states.  To specify these last two quantum numbers, we 
note that 
] = [(J  + 2 J ˆ
](cid:215) J  „ 0
] = 2 [J ˆ
), J  ] = [2 J ˆ
[J  , J 1 z

and similarly for  Jˆ
2 z  .  Thus  Jˆ
1 z  and  Jˆ
2 z  do not share common 
eigenfunctions with  J ˆ  2 .  To put it another way, to obtain a definite 
state of the total angular momentum, one must generally mix states 
with different  m1 and  m2 .  All thus leads to the conclusion that neither 
m1 nor  m2 can be one of the other quantum numbers that specify the 
coupled basis.

Hence,  J ˆ  2 , Jˆ

2  share common eigenfunctions, and these 
1 
eigenfunctions define the coupled basis.  To say it another way, the 
eigenstates of  J ˆ  2  do not mix states with different  j  and  j2 .  This is
1
rather profound – in the case of spin-orbit coupling it means that 
states with different values of  l  will not be mixed by the coupling. 

The appropriate quantum numbers for the coupled basis are  j ,  m ,  j1
and  j  and we have:

Typically, certain matrix elements will be easier to compute in the 
coupled basis, while others will be easier to compute in the 
uncoupled basis.  Thus, we will often need to transform from one 
basis to the other.  Since the coupled and uncoupled bases are both 
eigenfunctions of Hermitian operators, each forms a complete basis 
for the angular momentum and therefore we can write: 
j, m;  j  ,  j  =  (cid:1)  j  , ' m ;  j  , ' m 
j, m;  j ,  j 
j  , ' m  ;  j  , ' m

with different  j  and  j  so:

This implies that either the CG coefficient is zero, or 

ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
m = m1 
+ m2 . 
Thus, for all the non-zero CG coefficients, the index  m  is actually 
redundant; it is always given by the sum of  m1 and  m2 . 

b. Recursion Relations 

There are several ways to determine the CG coefficients.  Perhaps 
the easiest is to look them up in a book (they have been extensively 
tabulated).  However, this method is the most prone to error, unless 
you are very careful to follow all of the sign conventions of the text at 
hand (which may not be the same as the sign conventions in, say 
CTDL or these lecture notes). 

Another route is to simply view the whole thing as an eigenvalue 
problem: one simply wishes to determine the eigenstates of  J ˆ  2  in the 
uncoupled basis.  The coefficients of the different eigenvectors are 
the CG coefficients.  However, this misses out on what is probably 
the most important aspect of angular momentum coupling – the ability 
without any significant computation to predict the allowed 
quantum numbers and their degeneracies. 

We will follow a third route to obtain the CG coefficients.  This notes 
that the coefficients are easily obtained by recursion, in a manner 
similar to what we used for the spherical harmonics.  First we note 
+ m2 max 
= m1max 
:
that there is only one non-zero coefficient for  m 
max 
.  No other combination of  m1 and  m2
2 , m2 max 
;  j  ,  j 
j , m 
j1 , m1max ;  j 
max

2 
;  j  ,  j  and 
will give the correct total  m .  Thus, the states 
j, m 
2 
1 
max 
are equal up to an unimportant constant.  By 
2 , m2 max 
j , m 
;  j 
1 
1max 
convention, this constant is chosen to be 1.  W e can generate the 
other coefficients by successive applications of the lowering operator 
and judicious use of orthogonality constraints. 

To see how this is applied in practice, it is best to use spin-orbit 
coupling as an example.  W hat is the coupled basis for a spin-1/2 
electron with orbital angular momentum  l ?  W e can identify the 
uncoupled quantum numbers:

j  = l

And we want to determine the eigenstates of  Jˆ  2  ” ( L + S )  and 
2 
2
ˆ= L  + S ˆ 
J ˆ
.  W e know now that the two states with maximum  m  are

To get some insight into what these states look like, we need to make 
our notation a little less explicit, temporarily.  First we will delete the 
indices for  l and  s  from all the bra and ket states since these 
quantum numbers are the same throughout the calculation.  So, for 
ﬁ 
l  ﬁ,

where  »  means roughly “neglecting any constants that are not 
relevant for the point I want to make”.  In this case, they are factors 

ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
involving  l  and  s  that will be very important for doing calculations but 
impede our understanding at the outset. 

Using this notation, we can write the next lowered state:

So we see that the characteristic action of the lowering operator is to 
connect upper states in  ( m , m  )  space to states that are below and to 
l
s 
the right of the original state.  This action is limited by the fact that 
ml cannot be less than  - l  (this determines the “height” of the ladder) 
and  m  cannot be less than  - 1
2  (this determines the widths of the 
s 
rungs). 

c. The triangle rule 

So, have we now created all the coupled states?  W ell, the total 
number of coupled states in the ladder is  2 j + 1 = 2 ( l + 1 ) = 2 l + 2 .

(equivalently, we have presumed that they are rotating in the same 
plane an in the same sense – clockwise or counterclockwise) .  This is 
clearly an unnecessary restriction.  Hence, we expect there to be 
another possibility for  j  - specifically, in order to account for all the

different states with a given value of  m .  For example, in the chart 
above, we would need four states with  m=j1+j2-3 to support the four 
values of  j  that are listed.  Since the maximum degeneracy of each
