IX.  The Wigner-Eckart theorem 

We will now touch on a result that relates very deeply to the rotational 
symmetry of space.  However, its practical consequences are 
somewhat limited, and so we will only go over it in faint detail.  The 
basic thing that we observe is that simply looking at how quantum 
states behave under rotation gave us a terrific amount of insight into 
the quantum theory of angular momentum.  One can ask the 
corresponding question about operators: how do quantum operators 
behave when we rotate the system and what do we learn about 
operators in general (and most importantly, their matrix 
representations! ) by studying their rotational character?  W e will find 
many connections to our results for the addition of angular momenta. 

a. Spherical Tensors 

Key to the statement of the W igner-Eckart theorem is the definition of 
spherical tensor operators.  This is rendered quite difficult by the 
fact that most chemists and physicists do not know what a spherical 
tensor is (never mind the operator part).  This is just a geometrical 
concept, and once again we will find that the transition to quantum 
mechanics is trivial; all the  “weirdness” is classical. 

Under rotation, a classical observable  T  changes as 
(θ) ⋅ p )

n 
where “  ⎯ ⎯→ ”  indicates the act of rotation and R  (θ)  is a matrix
R
n 
rotates vectors by an angle θ about a unit vector n, as in the section 
on angular momentum.  Now, the interesting fact is that there are 
certain groups of observables that are related to one another by 
rotation.  Further, one finds that these groups always have an odd 
number of members!  Any such group of observables with  2k + 1 
elements is said to compose a spherical tensor of rank  k  (also called 
irreducible tensors).  By convention, these operators are indexed with 
the  2k + 1  numbers  q = − k ,− k + 1,...k − 1, k .  Mathematically, we require 
that any rotated element of the tensor be expressible as a linear 
combination of the un-rotated elements: 

k 
⎯⎯→ ƒ T Dk
q ' 
R 
q
q ' 
q ′  − =  k 
q
where the coefficients  Dq '  will depend on the axis and angle of 
rotation.  A few examples are helpful:

1)  Rank 0: These are typically called scalars.  Examples 
include all pure numbers and the dot product of any two 
vectors, for example:

2)  Rank 1: These are typically called vectors. Examples 
include angular momentum ( L ) as well as  r  and  p  : 
⎯⎯→( R  (θ) ⋅ r ) = ƒ ( R  (θ))

the  q = − 1,0,1 ordering, it is convenient to define

Note the similarity with angular momentum and the

3)  Rank 2: No special name here, but one can typically 
extract a spherical tensor of rank 2 from a matrix 
M = u ⊗ v  (where  u  and  v  are vectors) by subtracting its 
trace (a scalar) and a term that looks like the cross 
product of  u  and  v  (a vector).  To be precise:

u  ⋅

The original matrix had 3x3=9 components so removing 1 
with the scalar and 3 with the vector leaves 9-1-3=5 left­
over components that conveniently make up a second

rank tensor  M .

Overall, we stress the resemblance of a spherical tensor of rank  k  to 
a system with  k  units of angular momentum. 

b. Spherical tensor operators 

To put it succinctly, a spherical tensor operator in quantum 
mechanics is simply an operator that behaves like a spherical tensor 
under rotations.  Thus, for a tensor operator of rank  k : 
k 
k  Ω ƒ T ˆ  Dk
T ˆ 
q ' 
q
q
q ' 
q ′ − =  k 
The quantum definition is more general than the classical one, in that 
it encompasses (in principle) a greater variety of possible rotations, 
including ones in  “spin ” space.  However, in practice we will be most 
interested in physical rotations. 

c. The Wigner –Eckart Theorem 

The W igner-Eckart theorem tells us what information we can discern 
about the matrix elements of a spherical tensor operator  Tˆ  between 
k
angular momentum eigenstates.  The reason we are interested in this 
is that  we know that tensor operators have a special relationship to 
rotations, and these rotations are generated by angular momentum. 
Note that this is only interesting if the eigenstates and the tensor are 
defined with respect to the same type of rotation.  For example, if the 
operators form a spherical tensor with respect to spin rotations, there 
need be no special relationship of these operators between orbital 
angular momentum eigenstates. 

We thus wish to compute a matrix element like: 
α, '  j  , ' m ' T  α,  j , m
q
k 
where α and α' symbolize the values of all other quantum numbers 
in the system (e.g. principal quantum number, spins, vibrational 
quantum numbers, etc.).  The W igner-Eckart theorem tells us 
j  , ' m ; '  j , k  α, '  j ' Tk 
α,  j
α, '  j  , ' m ' T  α,  j , m  =  j , 
q
k m ;
, 
q 
k 
the first term is just the CG coefficient  for two angular momenta (of 
magnitudes  j  and  k ) coupling together to make a total angular 
momentum of magnitude  j ' .  The second term is called the reduced 
matrix element.  The theorem does not give us any way to construct 
this, but the important point is it depends only on α,  j ',  j  and  k .  W e 

will not prove this result, but a proof can be found in several different 
text books (e.g. Sakurai p.239 and Merzbacher, p. 396, but not 
CTDL). 

What insight does this give us?  W ell, first it is important to note that 
this result jives with our observation that  Tˆ  behave as if they had 
k
angular momentum of magnitude  k  - the CG coefficients involve 
coupling  j  units of angular momentum (from the ket) with  k 
additional units to make a total angular momentum  j ' (in the bra). 
Where else could the angular momentum be coming from, if not  Tˆ  ?k
Second, this allows us to apply our selection rules for the CG 
coefficients to drastically reduce the number of coefficients we 
calculate.  Specifically, the matrix element is zero unless: 
q = m ′ − m 
j −  j ' ≤ k ≤  j +  j ′ . 
and 
The first relation is just conservation of total  m  applied to the CG 
coefficient and the second is the triangle rule at work.  Finally, it is 
important to note that the reduced matrix element does not depend 
on which element of  Tˆ 
k we choose (i.e. does not depend on  q ) and it 
does not depend on  m  or  m ' .  This drastically reduces the work we 
have to do in practice.  For example, if we want to compute the matrix 
elements of  z  between the Hydrogenic eigenfunctions, we note that 
z  is a component of the rank 1 tensor  r  and so: 
=  m 
l n  , '  ' 
0,1; 
l  , ' m ; '  l 1, 
, ' 
, ' 
' 
, , 
,
z 
l 
l n 
l n z m 
m 
which implies that this matrix element is zero unless 
j −  j ' ≤ k ≤  j +  j ′ 
m ′ − m = 0 
and 
which is more familiar as 
and  Δ j =  ,0 ± 1 
Δ m = 0 
with  j =  j ' = 0  excluded.  This is an example of a selection rule.  You 
will see a great many more relations like this next semester.
