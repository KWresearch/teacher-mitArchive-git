VII.  Central Potentials 
 
Before going any further with angular momentum, it is best to begin 
using the relations we already have so that we can get some idea 
what they are good for.  Perhaps the best application of the angular 
momentum eigenfunctions we dealt with in the previous section 
comes when one deals with a spherically symmetric (or central) 
potential.  In this case, the potential energy is only a function of the 
distance  r  to the origin, and the knowledge we already have will tell 
us a great deal about the eigenstates of the system irrespective of 
the particular potential. 
 

a. Spherical Polar Coordinates 

 
Since we are dealing with a potential that is a function only of the 
distance  r  to the origin, it is by far preferable to work in a set of 
coordinates where  r  is one of the basic variables, rather than some 
.To this end, we need to convert our equations to 
function of

f is defined to be the angle relative to the  z  axis while the vast 
majority of quantum mechanics

texts use qin this capacity.  W e will 
use the latter definition, but be 
careful that  any equations taken 
from other sources use this same 
convention!   Here are some useful 
relations in spherical polar 
coordinates:

At this point, we convert the equations to natural units by choosing

our unit of length and unit of mass so that 
.  Note that this 
leaves us one free standard unit (time, or, equivalently, energy).  It is 
convenient to fix this dimension based on the problem at hand; for 
example, in a harmonic oscillator, it is useful to choose the energy so 
1=w(cid:1)
that 
, while for the Coulomb interaction it is useful to choose the 
unit of electron charge to be that of one electron.  These units are 
merely out of convenience and in the end, once we have calculated 
an observable (such as the position) we will need to convert the result 
to a set of standard units (such as meters).  The main benefit at the 
moment is that it removes the relatively unimportant factors of  (cid:1)  and 
m  from our equation, so that in natural units:

c. Orbital Angular Momentum Operators 
In order to see what angular momentum has to do with this, we need 
to express the angular momentum operators in spherical polar 
coordinates, as well. In this case, the relevant type of angular 
momentum is that of the particle orbiting around the origin:

Of course, we really want to know what the eigenfunctions look like in

that is, we have chosen it so that the spherical harmonics are 
orthonormal. 
 
Now, one important constraint on these solutions is that  l  must be 
an integer.  To see this, note that half-integer  l  would imply half-
integer  m .  In this case we have a problem, because as we seep 
pf 2=D
around an angle 
 the wavefunction needs to return to its 
original value; that is, it needs to be periodic.  However, if  m  is half-
1=m
integer, this is not true.  For example, if

Because the half integer solutions do not obey the proper boundary 
conditions, they must be discarded. 
 
Hence, even though our derivation above seemed to indicate that 
angular momentum could be half-integer, for the special case of 
orbital angular momentum, this is not possible.  W e will see shortly 
that half-integer angular momenta are crucial for the description of 
particle spins.  In any case, this shows how the general quantization

permissible.

that is, the three dimensional wavefunction is separable into a 
product of three one dimensional wavefunctions.  This is not 
generally the case, and is one of the particularly nice properties of 
spherically symmetric potentials.  The radial function will generally 
depend on the form of the potential, but it will obey the equation:

hydrogen-like atoms  – that is, atomic ions with only on e electron (H, 
He+, Li+2…). First, we will make the “infinite mass” approxima
tion for 
the nucleus -  we place the it at the origin and assume it never moves 
because it is much more massive than the electron.  This is a fairly

orbitals, for  l =0,1,2,3,4,5 ….  Hence, we have 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s,

do not depend on  l !   This is a feature peculiar to Hydrogenic 
potentials and is related to an additional symmetry 
possessed by the Coulomb potential.  This is termed an 
“accidental ” degeneracy of the levels. 

 
Finally, before moving on, we note that these are only the bound 
states of the hydrogen atom.  There are also positive energy states 
that are oscillatory instead of decaying.  W e will not concern 
ourselves with these states, except to say that the bound 
eigenfunctions by themselves are not a complete basis – only if the 
unbound solutions are included is completeness reached. 
 

g. Electron Spin 

 
Up to this point, we have been treating the electron as a structureless 
particle that has a mass and an electric charge.  However, the 
electron actually has intrinsic angular momentum, as we now show. 
 
It turns out that the electron has a magnetic moment.  This can be 
measured experimentally in a Stern-Gerlach experiment.  Here, one 
takes a beam of atoms that have one excess electron beyond a filled 
shell (most often Silver, but one could use Sodium, as well).  The 
beam is passed through an inhomogeneous magnetic field.  If the 
electron has a magnetic moment, the classical force on the electron 
» mF
B(cid:209)(cid:215)
is 
, where  m  is the magnetic moment and  B  is the 
magnitude of the magnetic field.  Thus, particles with different 
moments will be deflected differing amounts by the magnetic field.  
When one performs the experiment, one observes:  
 
      
 
 
 
      N

Magnet ic 
moment  “up”

 

Thus, the magnitude magnetic moment of the electron is fixed, and 
the direction it points is quantized and can take on one of two values. 
 
Now, how does this lead us to conclude that the electron has an 
intrinsic angular momentum?  There are two arguments that lead to 
this conclusion: 
 

1)  Classically, magnetic moments are always due to circulating 
currents – this is known as Ampere’s hypothesis.  Thus the 
intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron leads us to 
postulate an associated angular momentum, called spin.  
The fact that there are only two possible orientations for the 
spin implies that the electron is spin-1/2 , for then the two 
1–=
.  Classically, one 
orientations correspond to

2)  Again, classically, a magnetic moment moving in a potential 
( )r
V(cid:209)·(cid:215)
experiences a force 
.  For the central potentials 
pm
we are dealing with, the gradient of the potential will always 
point in the  r  direction.  Thus the force is proportional to 
(cid:215)(cid:181)·(cid:215)
.  Now the different components of  Lˆ
 do not 
Lmrpm
commute, and so it is clear that if we add the appropriate 
quantum correction for the interaction of the magnetic 
(cid:215)
Lm ˆ
) angular momentum will no 
moment with the potential (
longer be conserved!   This can be ameliorated if we assume 
the electron carries an intrinsic angular momentum and that 
it is the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta that is 
conserved.

For these reasons, we conclude that the electron has an intrinsic 
angular momentum of magnitude 1/2.  We can thus work out the 
commutation relations and eigenvalue relations for spin by 
specializing our general results for angular momentum.  First, there 
are the eigenvalue equations:

One can easily verify that these matrices satisfy the correct 
commutation relations.  There are a lot of things one can learn about 
quantum mechanics even from a system as simple as this.  But for 
the time being, we will be content with these relationships. 
 
How does all this affect our previous calculations that neglected spin 
entirely?  Thankfully, the effects are rather mild.  To a good 
approximation, we can simply think of the spin as an additional 
degree of freedom.  Operators that act in coordinate space will 
commute with the spin degree of freedom, and vice versa. Since 
none of our Hamiltonian operators, to this point, have involved spin, 
s and 
sm  have been good quantum numbers.  Hence, we can simply 
think of each wavefunction as actually representing one of two 
degenerate components that are identical in coordinate space and 
differ only in spin space – one has spin  a, the other spin  b.  
 
However, our previous arguments indicate that the Hamiltonian for a 
central potential should contain a term proportional to

thus, there is an interaction between spin and orbital angular 
momentum.  In order to deal with this, it is advantageous to first 
consider how one deals with multiple angular momenta, in general.
