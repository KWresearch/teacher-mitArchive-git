 

X. Perturbation Theory 
In perturbation theory, one deals with a Hamiltonian that is composed 
of two pieces: a reference part  (
)0
ˆH  that is typically exactly solvable 
and a perturbation  (
)1
ˆH  that is assumed to be “small”.  In practice, 
this usually arises because we can experimentally control the 
ˆH  represents the interaction with 
ˆH ; for example, if 
importance of 
1
1
an external magnetic field, we can control the strength of this 
interaction by varying the magnitude of the field.  In this general 
situation, it is useful to consider the general Hamiltonian: 
( )
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
 
λ
λ

H

Here, λ is our “control” parameter – it allows us to isolate the 
( )λHˆ
ˆH  on the eigenvalues and eigenstates of 
influence of 
.  At the 
1
end of the calculation, the “physical” Hamiltonian will always 
correspond to 
1=λ , but at the intermediate stages λ allows us to 
collect terms in a meaningful way. 
 
Now, given an arbitrary Hamiltonian, how are we to choose the 
appropriate reference Hamiltonian?  It is clear that for a given  Hˆ  we 
can choose any reference we like by writing: 
(
)0

 the full Hamiltonian takes the desired 
−

ˆH !  In practice this is 
reference+perturbation form for any choice of 
0
ˆH  will 
complicated by the fact that different choices of the reference 
0
give different perturbation expansions – a good choice will give 
accurate answers, but a bad choice will give poor results.  Thus, in 
many situations, the accurate use of perturbation theory essentially 
ˆH .   
reduces to the art of choosing a good reference

look like (Harmonic oscillator + other terms) or (step potential + other 
terms).  It should be stressed that this is not a necessary assumption 
to apply perturbation theory; one can also formulate perturbative 
expansions based on approximately solvable reference Hamiltonians, 
but we will not treat this case in this course.

ˆH  has a “small” influence 
Now, recall that our physical picture is that 
1
ˆH .  This can be enforced by examining the behavior of the

eigensystem for small λ.  To this end, we assume that we can 
expand the eigenstates and eigenvalues in a Taylor series in λ:

Note that this is really just a convenient way to check that we have 
done all the algebra right; in the general case, the exact eigenvalues 
will be unknown and the perturbative results will be our only guide. 
 
Now, the expressions above do not apply if the eigenstate we are 
interested in is degenerate with another eigenstate.  In this case

 and the second order energy correction diverges!  This, in

turn, is related to the fact that, in general, the first order change in the

( )2
first order energy change 
'nE  will typically be different from 
nE  and 
( )2
mE .  Because of this ambiguity in the first derivative, the second 
derivative ends up being infinite.  Looking at the second order energy 
expression, the only way this could possibly be avoided is if

happen but, as we are about to show, for any number of degenerate

Assume we have  k  degenerate zeroth order states:

that the off-diagonal elements of

correction will be enough to break the degeneracy, in which case the 
second order energy is not needed.  However, in extraordinary cases, 
the second order correction may be needed.

and compute the second order energy correction for each state in the 
block in turn before moving on to the next block.  Note that making a 
change of basis within one block (e.g. block 1) will not affect the first 
or second order energy for a state in another block (e.g. block 2). 
Hence, if you are only interested in states in, say, block 1, you do not 
need to worry about transforming the degenerate states in block 2.
