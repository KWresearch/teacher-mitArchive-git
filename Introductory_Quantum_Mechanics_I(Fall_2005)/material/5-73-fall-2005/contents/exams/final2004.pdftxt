On this exam, partial credit will be given for incomplete or 
incorrect solutions, so please briefly summarize how you 
arrived at your answers. 
 
Problems 1 and 2 are required. You must provide answers 
to these two problems.  You should then pick two of the 
remaining problems (3,4 and 5) to solve.  Please indicate 
below which of these problems you wish to have graded: 

 

1.  (25 pts.) Consider an experiment on a system that can be described using 
two basis functions.  In this experiment, you begin in the ground state of 
Hamiltonian H0 at time t1.  You have an apparatus that can change the 
Hamiltonian suddenly from H0 to H1. You turn this apparatus on at time t1.  
Then, at time tD > t1, you perform a measurement of an observable, D.  In 
matrix notation, the Hamiltonians and the operator D are given below.

is the state of the system after each measurement?

b.  If you perform many, many measurements, what will be the 
average observed value of D as a function of t1 and tD?  Explain the 
behavior you see.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Problem 1(cont’d) 
c.  At tD, you measure D, then the energy and then D again in rapid 
(i.e. essentially instantaneous) succession. What is the probability 
that the two measurements of D yield the same result?  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d.  You perform the experiment, but suspect your apparatus is 
malfunctioning and turning off at some systematic time t2 between 
t1 and tD.  In other words, at some time t2, you suspect the 
Hamiltonian is reverting to H0.  What qualitative effect would this 
have on your results from part b.? [Note: this only requires a 
qualitative description, not a full calculation.]

2. (25 pts.)You had the angular momentum operators for a particular system 
written down on a scrap of paper.  Unfortunately you have misplaced the scrap of 
paper and you have a meeting with your research advisor in 20 minutes.  The 
only things you remember are that the operators were each represented by 4x4 
matrices and that there was one possible value for the total angular momentum.  
Thus, you have
