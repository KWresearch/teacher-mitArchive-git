5.73 Midterm 

This exam is open book, open notes.  However, you should not 
consult other people about your solutions to these problems.  Any 
questions (particularly questions that will clarify the intent of a 
question) should be directed to the Instructor or Graders. The 
exam should be turned in no later than 5 pm Friday, Oct. 28th.

1.	 Previously, in Problem Set 3, we considered scattering off of a 
repulsive δ-function potential of strength V 0 .  In particular, we 
found that the transmitted and reflected fluxes were (Z = m = 1) : 
k 2 
1
and  R = 
T  = 
1 + k 2 
1 + k 2
Here, we consider scattering off of two repulsive 

2E
where  k = 
V 0 
δ-functions of 
strength V 0 .  One 
would naively 
expect that the 
probability of 
transmission 
through two 
barriers would 
always be less 
than for one (i.e. 
only particles that 
0 
make it across the 
first barrier can make it across the second).  In this problem you 
will show that this is not necessarily the case and develop an 
explanation for this. Therefore, consider the potential:

a.	 Assume that our particle is incident from the left with 
energy  E .  Divide the system up into three regions as 
shown above and determine the appropriate scattering 
state by matching the allowed wavefunctions in the three 
regions.  The algebra is a bit tedious here. You will need 
to keep careful track of the derivative discontinuity at each

delta function, which becomes a bit painful.  You may 
wish to use a program like Mathematica to do some of the 
algebra for you.  If so, I highly recommend the “Solve[ …]’ 
and  “Simplify[ …]” commands. 
b.	 Compute the total transmission and reflection probabilities 
q E ,  and V 0 .  That is, compute the 
as a function of 
0 
probability flux of particles in region I moving to the left 
(reflected particles) and that in region III moving to the 
right.  Verify that flux is conserved. 
c.  Show that, for some values of 
q E ,  and V 0 the 
0 
transmitted flux is greater when the particle scatters off 
two delta functions than one.  Develop an explanation for 
this phenomenon.  It may prove useful to plot the real part 
of the wavefunction for one of the offending choices of 
= 1  what separation

a.	 Use DVR to determine the bound state energies of this 
potential, keeping careful track of your units. Here, the 
bound states are all those stationary states with energy 
less than the dissociation energy  D .  Note that there are 
a finite number of bound states and you should choose 
your DVR basis so that all are accurately predicted.  Fit 
your results to the standard vibrational form:

increase the mass?  Is this sensible?
