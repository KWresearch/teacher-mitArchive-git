MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,500
Welcome.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,480
Today's problem is about finding
solutions of this

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,350
non-homogeneous linear system, x
minus 2y minus 2z equals b1,

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,030
2x minus 5y minus 4z equals
b2, and 4x minus 9y

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,310
minus 8z equals b3.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,250
And as you can see, the system
doesn't only have numbers and

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,220
unknowns, it also has
parameters, b1, b2, and b3,

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,070
and the solution will depend on
this parameters, but also

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,130
the existence of the solution
will depend on these

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,090
parameters.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,670
And we're asked to find a
solution and find when it

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,640
exists, depending on the values
of b1, b2, and b3.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,300
So now you should pause the
video, solve the problem, and

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,306
come back and compare your
solution with mine.

17
00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:57,450

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,420
And we're back.

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,310
Let's try it.

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,010
Let's start by solving this
system as though b1, b2, and

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,900
b3 were numbers.

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:13,030
So we write the matrix of the
system, which is 1 minus 2

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:30,050
minus 2, b1, and then 2 minus
5 minus 4, b2, and 4 minus 9

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,430
minus 8, b3.

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,880
And we do elimination.

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,990
So we multiply the first row by
minus 2 and add it to the

27
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,500
second row.

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,620
And we multiply it by minus 4
and add it to the third row.

29
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,130

30
00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:06,660
And we get 1 minus 2 minus 2 b1,
0, 4 minus 5 is minus 1, 4

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,010
minus 4 is 0, and minus
2 times b1 plus b2.

32
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,410

33
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:23,010
And here we get 0, 8 minus
9 is minus 1, and

34
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,660
8 minus 8 is 0.

35
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,590
Finally on the right-hand
side, minus 4b1 plus b3.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,590

37
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,310
And you can already see
that something's

38
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,750
going to happen here.

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,800
But let's do one more step.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:54,260
So eliminating further we get 1
minus 2 minus 2 b1, 0 minus

41
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:03,200
1 0 minus 2b1 plus b2.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,390
And in the last row we replace
it with the last row minus the

43
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:18,410
second row, and we get 0
0 0 minus 4b1 plus 2--

44
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:30,670
so minus minus 2b2 is minus
2b1 minus b2 and plus b2.

45
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,920
I hope I did this right.

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,290

47
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,720
So now let's think of it
as a system again.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,480
The last equation says 0 equals
this expression in b1,

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,870
b2, and b3.

50
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,450
So this is something
to note down.

51
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:58,900
If minus 2b1 minus b2 plus b3
is some number that's not 0,

52
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,400
then the last equation is going
to say 0 equals non-0.

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,500
It's never going to be
satisfied, and the entire

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,630
system is never going
to have a solution.

55
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,030
So in this case, we
have no solutions.

56
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:22,550

57
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:31,400
If this is equal to 0, so minus
2b1 minus b2 plus b3 is

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,880
equal to 0, then let's do one
more step on this matrix here.

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,730
Let's turn this number into 1
by multiplying this row by

60
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,060
negative 1.

61
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,160
And let's use it to eliminate
this number here as well.

62
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,740
So in this case, we get--

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,260
let me write it from the last
row, which now becomes 0 0 0

64
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,950
equals 0, which is fine.

65
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:07,670
The second row becomes
0 1 0 2b1 minus b2.

66
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,560
And the first one to get rid of
this minus 2, we multiply

67
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,960
this row by negative 2 and
add it to the first one.

68
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:27,790
We get 1 0 negative 2, and here
we get b1 plus 4b1, which

69
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:36,030
is 5b1 minus 2 b2.

70
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,260
The reason why we did
it was to get the

71
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,550
identity matrix here.

72
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,890
And now let's solve this.

73
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,750
These two columns corresponding
to variables x

74
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,690
and y have pivots in them.

75
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,985
So these are the pivot
variables.

76
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:56,700

77
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,190
This column here has
no pivot in it,

78
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,440
so it's a free variable.

79
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,310

80
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,440
And now we're going to calculate
the solutions, but

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,840
by picking particular values
for z, and then calculating

82
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,350
the values for x and y, which we
have two kinds of solution.

83
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,915
One kind is the particular
solution.

84
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:22,310

85
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,390
So this one solves
Ax equals b.

86
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,920
There's only one of them.

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,250
And we get it by setting the
free variable equal to 0.

88
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:45,050
Setting the free variable equal
to 0, we get, well this

89
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,540
is equal to 0.

90
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,375
The second equation says y
equals this thing here,

91
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:55,870
so 2b1 minus b2.

92
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,640
And the first equation says x
minus 2 times 0 equals this

93
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,100
expression here.

94
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,320
So 5b1 minus 2b2.

95
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,280

96
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,010
That's our particular
solution.

97
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,650
The next kind is the
special solution.

98
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,270

99
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,470
So remember, those solve
Ax equals 0.

100
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,370
There's as many of them as
there are free variables.

101
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,430
In our case, there's only one.

102
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,430
And we get it by setting all
free variables equal to 0,

103
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,450
except one equal to 1.

104
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,620
And do it for every
free variable.

105
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,250
So in our case there's only one
free variable and we set z

106
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,750
equal to 1.

107
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,260
The solution that we get in this
case, and remember we're

108
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,440
solving Ax equals 0-- we
don't care about the

109
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,130
right-hand side anymore--

110
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,420
so z is 1.

111
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:06,700
This second equation says y
equals 0, and the first

112
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,540
equation says x minus
2 times 1 equals 0.

113
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,220
In other words, x equals 2.

114
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,200
So the special solution
is 2 0 1.

115
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:31,740
And now all solutions are of the
form x equals a particular

116
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,460
solution plus any multiple
of the special solution.

117
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,799
Let me recap.

118
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,090
In case this particular
combination of parameters is

119
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,150
not 0, there's no solutions.

120
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,140
In case this particular
combination of parameters is

121
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,010
equal to 0, there are solutions,
there are as many

122
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,080
of them as there are real
numbers c, and they're all of

123
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,420
this form for these
two vectors.

124
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,880
And that's all I wanted
to say today.

125
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,130
