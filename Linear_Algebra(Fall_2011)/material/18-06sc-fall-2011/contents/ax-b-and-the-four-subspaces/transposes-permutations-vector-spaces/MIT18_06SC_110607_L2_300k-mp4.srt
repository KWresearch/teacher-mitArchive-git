00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,560
PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome
back to recitation.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,490
In the lecture, we've learned
very important concepts--

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,620
linear space and linear
subspace.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,200
Well, as you can imagine, if
we call something a space,

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,670
we're putting a lot of things, a
lot of objects into one set.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,760
But for linear space, we want to
put them in according to a

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,680
particular manner.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,360
So can you recall what are the
conditions for a set to be a

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,280
linear space?

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,150
You take any two elements
from that set,

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,490
take the sum of them.

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,400
You want the sum to be still
in the same set.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,370
That's the first condition.

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,010
Second, you take any multiple of
any element from that set,

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,190
the result will still
be in that set.

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,140
That's the second condition.

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,780
And if within a linear space
you can find a subset which

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,700
also satisfies the two
conditions, that will give you

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,560
a subspace.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,840
Today, we're going to look at
this example to review these

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,870
two important properties of
linear space and subspace.

23
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,980
I have two vectors, x1 and x2.

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,480
Both of them are
vectors in R3.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,910
So as you can see, I've
drawn them here.

26
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,750
This is x1, and this is x2.

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,740
So first, we want to find the
subspace generated by x1.

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,820
I call it v1.

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,430
Let me say a word about
this generated by.

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,190
So what do I mean by a subspace
generated by x1?

31
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm looking for the smallest
subspace that contains x1, as

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,470
small as you can get.

33
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,690
Similarly, I want to find out
the subspace generated by x2,

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,520
call it v2.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,880
Then we want to say something
about the

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,240
intersection of v1 and v2.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,080
That's the first question.

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,570
And the second question, we want
to put vector x1 and x2

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,370
together and look at the
subspace generated by x1 and

40
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,890
x2 at the same time.

41
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,950
So I call it v3.

42
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,780
And a good question to be asked
here is what is the

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,820
relation of v3 to v1 union v2.

44
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,830
Do you think they're equal?

45
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,070
Within the second question, I
would also like you to find a

46
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,220
subspace, call it s of v3,
such that neither x1

47
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,730
nor x2 is in s.

48
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,490
And the last question is I'd
like you to say something

49
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:00,380
about the intersection of
v3 with the xy plane.

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,030
So notice that, of course,
xy plane is also

51
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,170
a subspace of R3.

52
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,740
So again, I'm looking at the
intersection of two subspaces.

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,930
All right, why don't you hit
the pause now, and try to

54
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,860
solve these three problems
on your own.

55
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,040
And I'd like you to identify
your answers in this picture

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,980
whenever you can.

57
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,740
I'll come back later and
continue working with you.

58
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:36,620

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,280
OK, how did your drawing go?

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,350
Let's look at this together.

61
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,660
First, we want to find subspace
generated by x1.

62
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,520
So here is x1.

63
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,220
Let's keep in mind the two
conditions that a subspace has

64
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,710
to satisfy.

65
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,010
Well, if I want to obtain the
subspace, at least I have to

66
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,880
be able to take any multiple
of x1, right?

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,040
So that means at least I have
to include the straight line

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,000
that contains x1.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,340
So I'm going to try to draw
the straight line here.

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,120
So I'm just simply going to
extend this x1 along to both

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,384
directions.

72
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:32,520
So x1, I will try very hard
to make it straight.

73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,130
But to be honest, it's really
hard for me to draw a straight

74
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,020
line from the board.

75
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,315
Is that straight?

76
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:41,990
Seems fine.

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,690
All right, so this entire
line contains x1.

78
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,982
So at least this line
has to be in v1.

79
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:55,000
Is there anything else
beyond this line?

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,920
Now let's turn to the
second condition.

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,770
The second condition says that
we have to be able to take any

82
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,760
two elements, take the
sum, and the sum will

83
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,500
remain in that set.

84
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,440
Does it work for this line?

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,830
You take any two vectors on this
line or you can say any

86
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,140
two points on this line, and
then you take to sum of them.

87
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,450
Of course, you still get
something on this line.

88
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,340
You won't be able to
escape from it.

89
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,720
Which means this line is a
perfect set that satisfies the

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,220
two conditions.

91
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,880
So this line simply
gives me v1.

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,010
That is the smallest subspace
that contains x1.

93
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,640
So in other words, the subspace

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,580
generated by x1 is v1.

95
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,560
So similarly, let's
look at x2.

96
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,700
What is the subspace
generated by x2?

97
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,030
Again you get the entire
straight line

98
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,050
that contains x2.

99
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,445
So I'm going to extend x2
in both directions.

100
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:08,530

101
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,780
I hope it's straight.

102
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,480

103
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,650
Not too bad.

104
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,810
That will give me v2.

105
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,840
All right, v1, v2.

106
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,890
Both of them are subspaces
of R3.

107
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,630
Now let's look at the
intersection of v1 and v2.

108
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,280
So we know that both of them
are straight lines.

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,260
And clearly they're not
parallel, because x1 and x2

110
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,770
are not parallel.

111
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,650
So what is the intersection
of v1 and v2?

112
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,960
The intersection of v1 and v2
is the only point at which

113
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,110
they cross.

114
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,490
And where's that point?

115
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,280
It's here, right
at the origin.

116
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,420
Because both of them
pass the origin.

117
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,690
I'm going to use o to denote.

118
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,360
That's the intersection
of v1 and v2.

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
This is a set with
only one element.

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,250
What can you say
about this set?

121
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,330
I claim this is also
a subspace of R3.

122
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,340
By saying space, we
usually mean a

123
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,210
lot of objects together.

124
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,110
But look at this set.

125
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,420
This set fits perfectly into
the conditions of being a

126
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,040
linear space.

127
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,850
You take any multiple of
0, again you get 0--

128
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,470
0 plus 0, you get 0.

129
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,840
So that's a perfectly
fine subspace of R3.

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,830
All right, so what we have
got here is I take the

131
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,700
intersection of v1 and v2, and
the result, again, becomes a

132
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,230
subspace, which only contains
the origin.

133
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,640
That completes the
first question.

134
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,210
Let's look at the second one.

135
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,170
In the second question, I want
to put x1 and x2 together, and

136
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,860
look at the subspace generated
by x1 and x2.

137
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,140
And I would also like you to
say something about the

138
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,440
relation between v1 union
v2 to the subspace

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,210
generated by x1 x2.

140
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,470
Let's try to answer the second
question first. Is there a

141
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,100
chance that v1 union
v2 equal to v3?

142
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,220
OK, so what is v1 union v2?

143
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,700
That's clearly just
two lines, right?

144
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,360
This line union this line.

145
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,710
Is there a chance that this
union will be a subspace?

146
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,830
Let's check the two
conditions.

147
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,260
First, you take any multiple of
the elements in this union.

148
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,210
It's either on this line
or on this line.

149
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,300
Seems that the multiple
is still going to

150
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,080
stay inside the union.

151
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,596
So the first condition is
actually satisfied.

152
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:00,700
What about the second one?

153
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,240
The second one says that I have
to be able to take any

154
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,280
sum, the sum of any
two elements,

155
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
from these two lines.

156
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,610
Let's just try a simple
sum, x1 plus x2.

157
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,210
So what is x1 plus x2?

158
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,570

159
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,710
You just sum up each
coordinate.

160
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:26,370
That will give you 2, 5, 3.

161
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,500

162
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,880
In this picture, can I draw
it in this picture?

163
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:41,045
It's going to be
somewhere here.

164
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:50,280

165
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,824
That's x1 plus x3.

166
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,560
Did you notice something?

167
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,530
You clearly have got
out of this union.

168
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:11,230
So this sum is not inside
v1 union v2.

169
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,730
Which means v1 union v2
is not a subspace.

170
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,830
Then it's impossible that this
union will equal to v3.

171
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:26,470
So the answer to the second
question is no, v3 is not

172
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,020
equal to v1 union v2.

173
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,540
Now let's identify v3.

174
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,340
Well, as you can see, since we
have seen from this argument

175
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,840
that we have to be able
to include this

176
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,490
diagonal vector here.

177
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,170
But in fact, as you can see
since we can take any elements

178
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,670
from these two lines, we're
actually including every

179
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,680
vector on the plane spanned
by v1 and v2.

180
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,380
So in other words, I'm actually
looking at this huge

181
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:06,690
plane that is spanned
by v1 and v2.

182
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,520
That will give me v3.

183
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,600

184
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,300
So that's reasonable.

185
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,380
I'm looking at the subspace
generated by two lines in R3.

186
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,780
And that two line will be able
to span a plane in R3.

187
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,500
Now for the last part of
question two, I want to find a

188
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,710
subspace s of v3.

189
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,540
So I want to find a subspace
of this plane such

190
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,570
that x1 is not s.

191
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,460
x2 is not in s either.

192
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,530
So I want to stay away from
this line and this line.

193
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,880
Can you find such a
subspace of v3?

194
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,470
It's right here.

195
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,280
Because if you look at this
vector, x1 plus x2-- sorry,

196
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,530
that should be x2.

197
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,240

198
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,400
If you look at this vector,
and if you look at the

199
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,410
subspace generated by this
vector, again you know it's

200
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,990
going to be a line.

201
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,390
And this line is right here.

202
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:18,790

203
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,840
This line forms a perfect
subspace of v3.

204
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,960
But neither x1 nor x2 is
inside this subspace.

205
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,790
So let's just make it
S. Of course, the

206
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,480
choice is not unique.

207
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,280
You can take twice x1 plus
x2 or x1 plus twice x2.

208
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,350
OK, we have completed
the second problem.

209
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,380
The last problems ask us to find
the intersection of v3

210
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,430
with xy plane.

211
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,930
Well, just think about that.

212
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,810
We've identified v3 as
this plane spanned

213
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,500
by line v1 and v2.

214
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,150
And xy is also a plane.

215
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,100
So we're talking about
the intersection of

216
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,830
two planes in R3.

217
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,660
What would that be?

218
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,590
So you have two planes
intersect.

219
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,120
The intersection will be a
straight line again, right?

220
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,080
So let's locate that
straight line.

221
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,050
We want to find something that
is inside of v3 and xy plane

222
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,300
at the same time.

223
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,480

224
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,380
What can you say about the
points in xy plane?

225
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,880
The z-coordinate has to be 0.

226
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,640
And at the same time, we
know that at least x1

227
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,290
and x2 are in v3.

228
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,130
So did you notice that?

229
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,760
x2 is a vector that
lies in v3.

230
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,830
But at the same time, the
z-coordinate of x2 is 0.

231
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,160
That is what we're
looking for.

232
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:12,220
So the intersection of v3 with
xy plane will simply be the

233
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,090
line that contains x2.

234
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:20,820
And here we've identified
that as v2.

235
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,340
That's it.

236
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,610
This is a subspace of R3.

237
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,580
And this is the subspace
of R3.

238
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,740
The intersection is again
a subspace of R3.

239
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,170
I hope you've learned a way to
somehow visualize this linear

240
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,380
space and subspace through
this exercise.

241
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,470
Thank you for watching, and
I'll see you next time.

242
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,907
