NIKOLA KAMBUROV: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,670
In this video, we're going to
explore briefly the concept of

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,270
a vector subspace.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,450
This is the problem
we're going to do.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:23,650
We're given these four different
subsets of R3, and

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,630
we are asked to figure out which
of these is, in fact,

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,020
the subspace.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,110
So I'll give you a few moments
to try to do this on your own,

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,510
and then please come back to
see whether you were right.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,110

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,790
So hi again.

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,920
So before we start, let's
briefly recall what a vector

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,500
subspace is.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,190
Well vector subspace, of
course, it's a subset.

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,600
In this case, a subset of R3.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,990
But it behaves like a vector
space itself, meaning that if

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,030
we take linear combination of
element in the subset, what we

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,920
get is still something
in that subset.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,130
And in class, professor Strang
showed you a few specific

21
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,010
examples of subspaces, which
are related to matrices.

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,670
One of them was the null space
of a matrix, all the vectors

23
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,960
that the matrix sends to 0,
and the column space of a

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,300
matrix, which is the span of
the column of a matrix.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,560
So let's see if we can apply
what we've learned in lecture

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,350
to our problem.

27
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,360
Number one, we are given a
linear equation relation

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,600
between b1, b2, and b3.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,320
Once we have something linear,
this is a philosophy that

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,890
you'll learn in this class, we
can always write this as a

31
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,470
matrix equation.

32
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,450
So in particular, b1 plus b2
minus b3 equals 0, we can just

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:22,690
write it as the matrix 1, 1
negative 1, and b1, b2, b3

34
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,420
equal to 0.

35
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,300
So therefore, b1, b2, and b3
precisely describe the null

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,560
space of 1, 1 negative 1.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,510
And thus, what we are
given in the first

38
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,750
question is a subspace.

39
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,450
What about the second one?

40
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,740
Again, we are given the relation
between b1, b2, b3,

41
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,510
but it's not linear.

42
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,050
b3 is the product
of b1 and b2.

43
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,080
So right, your guts tell you
that this shouldn't be a

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,330
vector space.

45
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,500

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,550
But we need to prove why.

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:14,200
Well, see that the vector 1,
1, 1 is inside this subset,

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,380
because the third entry is
the product 1, is the

49
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,530
product 1 and 1.

50
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:27,570
If the subset were a subspace
itself, then we would have 2,

51
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,600
2, and 2 in it as well.

52
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,610
Right, because any multiple of
a vector in the subspace is

53
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,620
inside the subspace.

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,730
But is 2, 2, 2 described
by this equation?

55
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,870
Well no, because the third
entry 2 is not

56
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,930
equal to 2 times 2.

57
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,395
So the example in number
2 is not a subspace.

58
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:58,880

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,130
Let's try 3.

60
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,520

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,810
And first, so we are given the
subset in question 3 is given

62
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,120
as the linear span of these two
vectors, 1 0 negative 1

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,920
and 1, 0, 1.

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,800
Plus the vector 1, 0, 0.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,160
So let's think about
this geometrically.

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,450
We know that the linear span
of two linear independent

67
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,270
vectors, and these are
obviously linearly

68
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,100
independent, is a plane in R3.

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,230
So we have the plane, and we add
a vector to the point on

70
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,720
this plane.

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,730
So what if the vector were
lying on the plane?

72
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,550
Well we're not going to
change the plane.

73
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,270
We're still going to remain
in the plane.

74
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,320
What I'm hinting at is
the following thing.

75
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,450
That, in fact, 1, 0, 0 is a
linear combination of 1, 0

76
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,670
negative 1 and 1, 0, 1, and
it's fairly obvious to see

77
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:12,010
which linear combination of
these two vectors it is.

78
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:19,625
It's 1/2, 1, 0, negative 1
plus 1/2 times 1, 0, 1.

79
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,270

80
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,210
So we can write the whole
relation here in

81
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,020
the following way.

82
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:38,790
b1, b2, b3 is 1, 0, 0, which
we can write this.

83
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:48,980
Plus 1, 0 negative 1,
and c2, 1 0, 1.

84
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,720

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,160
Let me continue this here.

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:07,040
So b1, b2 and b3 is precisely c1
plus 1/2 of 1, 0, negative

87
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,840
1 plus c2 plus 1/2 of 1, 0, 1.

88
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:25,570
So indeed, the points b1, b2,
and b3 are described by the

89
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,280
linear span 1, 0, negative
1, and 1, 0, 1.

90
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
So it is a vector
subspace itself.

91
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,360

92
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,585
And finally, let's
look at number 4.

93
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:43,330

94
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,410
So we have a similar
situation.

95
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,190
I mean it's almost the
same situation.

96
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,520
We again have the linear span of
precisely the same vectors

97
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,610
as in question 3.

98
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,260
But this time we add
the vector 0, 1, 0.

99
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,880
Now, 0, 1, 0 is not in the span
of these two vectors.

100
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,270
So the argument that we just
showed for 3 doesn't work.

101
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,100

102
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,530
But what we know about
vector subspace is

103
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,830
the following thing.

104
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:24,030
Almost treated from the axioms
that 0 needs to be inside the

105
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,450
subset in order for it
to be a subspace.

106
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,060
It's a necessary condition.

107
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,720
Well is 0 inside this subset?

108
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Meaning can we find coefficients
c1 and c2 plus 0,

109
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,300
1, 0 to equal 0 vector?

110
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,430
And the answer is no.

111
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,960
And why is this?

112
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,230
There's a very easy
way to see it.

113
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:13,460
Well we just look at the second
entry of the vector is,

114
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,780
and we see that any multiple.

115
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,480
So the linear span of these two
vectors will have as its

116
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,220
second entry 0.

117
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,270
And when we add it to 1, we can
never get a 0 entry here.

118
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,870
So the subset in 4 is
not a subspace.

119
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,970
So I hope this was useful and
just getting an intuition

120
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,380
which subsets of R3
are subspaces.

121
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,630
I'll see you guys later.

122
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,503
