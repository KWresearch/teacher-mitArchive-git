00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:08,560
PROFESSOR: Hi.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,010
Welcome to recitation.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,480
My name is Martina, and I'll be
your recitation instructor

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,940
for some of these linear
algebra videos.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,290
Today's problem is a
straightforward solve the

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,840
following linear system with
four equations and four

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,270
unknowns, using the method
of elimination.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:28,220
The system is x minus y minus z
plus u equals 0, 2x plus 2z

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,090
equals 8, minus y minus 2z
equals -8, and 3x minus 3y

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,830
minus 2z plus 4u equals 7.

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,760
And although you might know
different ways to solve the

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,400
system at this point, the method
of elimination is going

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,910
to show up a million times
during these videos, so it's

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,270
really important to
get it right.

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,270
So I suggest you try solving
this system now, using the

17
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,970
method of elimination as it
was described in class.

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,500
I'm going to leave you alone
with the problem.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,160
You should pause the video,
solve it yourself, and then

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,452
come back and compare your
solution with mine.

21
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:06,750

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,890
And we're back.

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,560
So the method of elimination, if
you remember it from class,

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,410
consisted of replacing this
system with an equivalent

25
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,390
system-- equivalent meaning they
have the same solution--

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,360
by a series of row operations.

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,580
Row operations are not supposed
to change the

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,860
solution to the system and
there, for example, exchange

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,320
the order of two equations.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,010
Multiply an equation with a
non-0 number, and add a non-0

31
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,310
multiple of one equation
to the other.

32
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,950
So let's do that.

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,900
As we're going to do this
series of arithmetic

34
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,310
operations, we don't really want
to copy the names of the

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,060
variables and the equality
signs every time.

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,680
So we're going to keep the
important information which

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,380
are these numbers.

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,060
these coefficients here, we're
going to keep that information

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,310
in a matrix.

40
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,250

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,520
So let's write a matrix.

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,300
Each row is going to grasp onto
an equation, and each

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,850
column is going to correspond
to an unknown.

44
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:09,220
So the first row is
1, -1, -1, 1.

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,190

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,370
The second row responding
to the second

47
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:24,450
equation is 2, 0, 2, 0.

48
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,760
And you want to be very careful
to put 0s on the right

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,560
spots here.

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,795
The third equation is 0--

51
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:33,120
I haven't left myself
enough room--

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,840
0, -1, -2, 0.

53
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,880
And the fourth row corresponding
to the fourth

54
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:49,990
equation is 3, -3, -2, 4.

55
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,770
And as we care about the right
hand side as well, we're going

56
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,920
to copy this information as
well, and get the augmented

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,230
matrix of the system.

58
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,100
0, 8, -8, 7.

59
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,620

60
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,170
OK, and now let's try reducing
this matrix to an upper

61
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,420
triangular one.

62
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,240

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,330
We start with the first column,
and we're going to use

64
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,390
this number called a pivot to
get rid of all the numbers

65
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,650
under it, so to get
0s here and here.

66
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,780
A way to do it is--

67
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,730
well, to get rid of this 2, I
have to multiply the first row

68
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,050
by -2, and add it to
the second one.

69
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,440
Writing this here is not
strictly necessary, but I like

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,550
to do a bit of bookkeeping,
because I'm prone to make a

71
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,200
lot of errors while doing this
simple arithmetic operations.

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
And then if I get to the end,
figure out I made a mistake

73
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,430
somewhere, this bookkeeping
makes it easier to backtrack

74
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,416
and find the place where
I made this mistake.

75
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,650
So we replace this matrix
with another matrix.

76
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,020
The first row stays the same.

77
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,480
1, -1, -1, 1, 0.

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,230
The second row gets replaced
by a second row, -2

79
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,580
times the first row.

80
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,000
The aim of that is to get a
0 here, so that's good.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,640
Next on this position here, we
get -2 times -1, which is 2

82
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,640
plus 0 which is 2.

83
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,339
-1 times -2, which is 2
plus 2, which is 4.

84
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,700
-2 plus 0 which is -2.

85
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,512
And 8 ,-2 times 0 which is 8.

86
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:29,950
The third row already has
a 0 here, so I can

87
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,360
just copy it over.

88
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,380
0, -1, -2, 0, -8.

89
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,130
And to get a 0 here, I'm going
to multiply the first row by

90
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:49,330
-3 and add it to the fourth
row and get 0, -3 times

91
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,880
-1 is 3 -3 is 0.

92
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,150
-3 minus 1--

93
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,700
oh, sorry--

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,100
3 -2 is 1, and -3 plus 4 is 1.

95
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,560

96
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,190
And there we go.

97
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,840
The first column looks like
a first column of an upper

98
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,200
triangular matrix.

99
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,950
Now let's do the same to
the second column.

100
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,610
This is going to be our pivot,
the number that we use to get

101
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,220
rid of numbers under it.

102
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,250
And we see that to get rid of
this number here, we will need

103
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,270
to multiply it with 1/2.

104
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,710
So multiply the whole second
row with 1/2, and add it to

105
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,830
the third row.

106
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:38,370
The matrix that we get will have
the first row the same.

107
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,910
It stays the same.

108
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:48,360
1, -1, -1, 1, 0.

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
The second row stays the same.

110
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,510
0, 2, 4, -2, 8.

111
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,100

112
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,210
The third row gets replaced by
the third row plus 1/2 times

113
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:14,820
the second row and becomes 0, 0,
2 -2 which is 0, -1 plus 0

114
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:22,970
which is -1, and 4
-8 which is -4.

115
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,330
And the fourth row already
has a 0 here so I

116
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,230
just copy it over.

117
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:34,570
0, 0, 1, 1, 7.

118
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,960
And now let's look
at this matrix.

119
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,740
It has the first two columns as
they're supposed to be, 0s

120
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,010
under the diagonal.

121
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,480
And now we want to
get a 0 here.

122
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,120
Normally what I would do is to
circle this number here,

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,060
multiply it by something so that
I get a -1, and add it to

124
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,440
this row to get a 0 here.

125
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,870
But that's not going to work.

126
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,850
You might remember from
lecture that 0s

127
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,310
can never be pivots.

128
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,520
Or you can just try finding a
number such that 0 times this

129
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,340
number equals -1, and seeing
that such a number doesn't

130
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,500
exist, because you're always
going to get 0.

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,390
So we can proceed as
we did until now.

132
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,920
But is there another way
to get a 0 here?

133
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,810
There is a very simple row
operation, which consists just

134
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,820
of switching the third
and the fourth row.

135
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,380
It certainly doesn't change the
solution of the system.

136
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,930
So let's do that.

137
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:35,770
And let's get the next matrix
which is 1, -1, -1, 1, 0.

138
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,250
0, 2, 4, -2, 8.

139
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,790
Then we put the fourth
row here.

140
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,920
0, 0, 1, 1, 7.

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,050
And we put the third row
here, 0, 0, 0, -1, -4.

142
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,740

143
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,590
And there it is.

144
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,830
This is an upper triangular
matrix.

145
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,710
So in the same way as at the
beginning, we had a system and

146
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,490
then wrote the matrix
representing it, this matrix

147
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,010
also represents a system.

148
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,210
And this system has the same
solutions as the initial

149
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,400
system but is much
easier to solve.

150
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,310
Now let's write this back as a
system, and let me do that not

151
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,220
starting from the first
equation, but starting from

152
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,900
the last equation.

153
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:35,020
So the last equation here reads
-u equals -4, which is,

154
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,530
as equations go, a pretty
easy one to solve.

155
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,909
The solution is u equals 4.

156
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,400
Now let's go back to
the third equation.

157
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,660
The third equation reads y--

158
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,070
no, I'm sorry-- z--

159
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,430

160
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,660
the third column corresponds
to z--

161
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,410
plus u equals 7.

162
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,690
But we know what's u now.

163
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:09,710
So, it reads z plus 4
equals 7, which just

164
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,980
becomes z equals 3.

165
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:25,280
The second equation is 2 times
y plus 4 times z, but z is 3,

166
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:33,160
minus 2 times u, but
you is 4, equals 8.

167
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,870
And from this, one can easily
compute that y is equal to 2.

168
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:52,200
And finally the first equation
reads x minus y minus z plus u

169
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,770
equals 0 or x equals 1.

170
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,980
And this is our solution.

171
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,130
x, y, z, and u equal
1, 2, 3, and 4.

172
