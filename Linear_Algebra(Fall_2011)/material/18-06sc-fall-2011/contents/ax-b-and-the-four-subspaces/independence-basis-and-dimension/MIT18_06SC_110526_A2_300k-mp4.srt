00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:07,920
PROFESSOR: Hi there.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,540
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,350
In lecture, you've been learning
about when vectors

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,550
are linearly independent, when
they span the space, what a

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,790
basis is, what a dimension
of a vector space is.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,630
And the problem for today
is exactly about that.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,500
We have a vector space
that is given.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,780
It's spanned by these
four vectors.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,009
And we're asked to find the
dimension of that vector space

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,259
and the basis for it.

12
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:35,700

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,290
Well why don't you hit pause on
the video, and work on it

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:39,770
for a while.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,510
And I'll come back in a little
bit to help you out with it.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:51,120

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,900
We're back.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,900
Let's work on it.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,310
So we need to find the dimension
and the basis.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,970
Remember what the
dimension is?

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,280
It's simply the number of
vectors in a basis for the

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,590
vector space.

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,680
So actually, the problem
is backwards.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,020
We want to find the basis for
the space first, and then find

25
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,840
the dimension.

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,700
I'll write first here
and second here.

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,410
So we want to find a basis for
the vector space spanned by

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,040
these four vectors.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,010
So you might be tempted to just
say that a basis for this

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,330
vector space is those four
vectors, because they span the

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,410
vector space.

32
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,350
But there's another thing that
a basis has to satisfy.

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,650
And it is the elements of the
basis have to be linearly

34
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,760
independent.

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,340
We don't know that these are.

36
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,750
So we have to check.

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,340
How do we check that four
vectors are linearly

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,670
independent?

39
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,800
Well, there's a couple
of different ways.

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,610
But here's what we're
going to do.

41
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,340
We're going to put these vectors
as rows of a matrix.

42
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,070
And then we'll do elimination.

43
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,180
And when we get to the end, the
rows that have pivots are

44
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,570
the independent ones.

45
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,220
So let's do that.

46
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,760

47
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:21,930
1, 1, -2, 0, -1, 1, 2, 0,
-4, 1, 0, 1, 3, -3, 2,

48
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,740
2, 3, 0, -2, 0.

49
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,540

50
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,730
By now you must have done
elimination a million times,

51
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,310
so I'll go a little
bit faster.

52
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:48,864
1, 1, -2, 0, -1, 0, 1,
0, plus 2, -4, 2--

53
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,730
this one's already done--

54
00:02:50,730 --> 00:03:02,170
1, 3, -3, 2, 2, -2, 3, -2,
0, plus 4, -2, and 2.

55
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,500

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,750
One more step.

57
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,740

58
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,353
1, 1, -2, 0, -1--

59
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:14,410
all these are done--

60
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:25,530
0, 1, 2, -4, 2, 0, 1 minus 1 is
0, 3 minus 2 is 1, -3 plus

61
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:34,770
4 is 1, 2 minus 2 is 0,
1 minus 1 is 0, 2,

62
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,402
2 again, and 0.

63
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:39,280
Well, you can see where
this is going.

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,760
In the next step, this row
is going to disappear.

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,748

66
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:55,230
1, 1, -2, 2, 0, -1, 0, 1,
2, -4, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1,

67
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,120
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,300
All right.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,550
We're done with elimination.

70
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,890

71
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,300
So let's circle our pivots.

72
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,934

73
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,470
All right, here are
our pivots.

74
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,040
We have three pivots.

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,340
And so these three rows are
linearly independent.

76
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,950

77
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,530
And in fact, these rows still
span the same space that the

78
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,970
initial four rows did.

79
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,640
Because when you do elimination,
all that you're

80
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,590
doing is recombining your
rows by doing linear

81
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,560
combinations of them.

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
So, for example, your first
row stayed the same

83
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,310
throughout.

84
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,850
Your second row was replaced
by row 2 minus row 1.

85
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,310
But it's really still spanning
the same space.

86
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,330
And it goes on.

87
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,640
And then the fourth row, it
turns out, was useless.

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,590
You only needed the
first three.

89
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,940
So the elements for a basis--

90
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,310
well, it will be these three.

91
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,560
So let me write that.

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,170

93
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:18,640
Basis (1, 1, -2, 0, -1),
2, 2 and 0, 0, 1, 1, 0.

94
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,440
Could you have used the
first three rows?

95
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,230
Yes, you could.

96
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,640
You can't always do that.

97
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,680
Sometimes in elimination, you
have to switch rows, because

98
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,750
there's a 0 where a
pivot should be.

99
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,950
When that happens, you have to
use these three, or you have

100
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,010
to keep track of which row you
switched to go back and use

101
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,200
the initial ones.

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,110
But it's really safe
to use these ones.

103
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,710
And also they're simpler than
the ones that you started

104
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,820
with, so why not?

105
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,810
The other question that we had
was what is the dimension of

106
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,740
the vector space?

107
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,780
Well, this is the easy part.

108
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,100
The dimension of the vector
space is 1, 2, 3.

109
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,620
And that solves the problem.

110
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,530
But there's one more thing
that I want to tell you.

111
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,990
I told you that there's a couple
of ways to find out

112
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,480
which of those four vectors
are linearly independent.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,150
And the one that I used was
I put them into rows and

114
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,310
performed elimination and picked
out the rows that have

115
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,050
pivots on them.

116
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,670
Another way to do it is to write
the initial vectors as

117
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,840
columns of the matrix and then
perform elimination.

118
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,560
That also works and, as you
know, because you're only

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,500
working with the transpose of
this matrix, you get the same

120
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,990
number of pivots.

121
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,520
Let's go over here where
I have the same--

122
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,990
well, the transpose
of that matrix--

123
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,100
I have the same vectors, but
now written as columns.

124
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,740
My four initial vectors
written as columns.

125
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,440
And here I have performed
elimination.

126
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,180
And this is the final result.

127
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,466
Let me circle the
pivots again.

128
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:59,860
Here they are, three, which
is going to give me three

129
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,670
linearly independent vectors and
hence, three elements of

130
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,800
the basis, and hence,
dimension 3

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,350
for the vector space.

132
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,280
But I could no longer use
these three columns as

133
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,180
elements of the basis, because
when I did elimination, I

134
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,500
changed the column space.

135
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,800
So the column space of this
vector-- of this matrix is not

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,290
the same as the column space
of the eliminated version.

137
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,410
So I cannot use these.

138
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,570
In fact, if you look at them,
you can probably understand

139
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,790
that they're not going to span
the same space as these.

140
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,080
Because all that I have down
here are 0s, and I get a lot

141
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,840
more than just 0s in the last
two entries of the vectors.

142
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,586
So what I need to do is--

143
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:48,310
the pivots are in the first,
second, and third columns.

144
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,550
I need to use these three
columns as my basis.

145
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,420
I'll just write basis
down here.

146
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,790
And that will work too.

147
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,740
So see, I have produced two
different bases for the same

148
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,190
vector space, which
is totally fine.

149
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,420
You can pick the basis
that you prefer.

150
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,100
All right.

151
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,040
We're done.

152
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,290
Thank you.

153
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:09,898
