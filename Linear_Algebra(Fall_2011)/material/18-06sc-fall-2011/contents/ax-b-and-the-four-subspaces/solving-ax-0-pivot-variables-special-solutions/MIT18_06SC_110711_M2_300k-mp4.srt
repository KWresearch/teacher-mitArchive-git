MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,740
Welcome back.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,320
Today's problem is about solving
homogeneous linear

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,940
systems, ax equals 0, but it's
also an introduction to the

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,070
next lecture and next recitation
section, which are

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,190
going to be about solving
non-homogeneous linear

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,000
systems, ax equals b.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,350
The problem is fill
the blanks type.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,070
And it says the set S of all
points with coordinates xy and

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:39,420
z, such that x minus 5y plus 2z
equals 9 is a blank in R3.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,330
It is in a certain relation to
the other blank S0 of all the

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,990
points with coordinates x,
y, and z that satisfy the

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,730
following linear equation, x
minus 5y plus 2z equals 0.

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,100
After we solve this, we have
the second part of the

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,866
problem, which says all points
of x have a specific form, x y

17
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:09,730
z equals blank 0 0 plus some
parameter times blank 1 0 plus

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,880
some other parameter
times blank 0 1.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,810
And we need to fill out
all six blanks.

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,490
Now you should pause the video,
fill in the blanks, and

21
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,270
then come back and see some
pretty pictures that I

22
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,520
prepared for you.

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,870

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,130
And we're back.

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,040
So you probably picked this
up in lectures already.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,760
If you have a three dimensional
space with three

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,960
degrees of freedom, and put in
one constraint, so put in one

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,830
equation, you get something
that has two degrees of

29
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,450
freedom, something that's
two dimensional.

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,540
If this equation is linear,
rather than quadratic or cubic

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,000
or exponential, this something
is something two

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,420
dimensional and flat.

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,310
Something two dimensional and
flat in R3 is also called a

34
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,740
plane, or a two plane.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,050
Similarly, S0 is also a plane.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,190
Now, what's the relation between
S and S0 if they're

37
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,850
given by these two equations?

38
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,130
Well first let's look at the
general positions in which two

39
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,450
planes in R3 can be.

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,270
First one is that they're
intersecting along a line.

41
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,820
What's going to happen here is
that all points on this plane

42
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,280
are points whose coordinates
satisfy the

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,070
equation of this plane.

44
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,840
The points in this plane are
points whose coordinates

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,020
satisfy the equation
of this plane.

46
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,650
And the points on the line are
points whose coordinates

47
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,090
satisfy the system of this
equation and this equation.

48
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,950
The other position in which
two planes can be is that

49
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,210
they're not intersecting at all,
that they're parallel.

50
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,810
So let's start by trying
to find this line here.

51
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:14,920
The equation of one plane is
x minus 5y plus 2z equal 9.

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,480
The equation of the other
one is x minus 5y

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,690
plus 2z equals 0.

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,590
Now you can just look at it
and see how many solutions

55
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,270
it's supposed to have, or you
can try doing elimination, and

56
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,200
after one step of elimination
get 0 equals

57
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,970
9, which never happens.

58
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,050
There cannot exist numbers x,
y, and z such that this

59
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,150
combination of them produces 0,
and the same combination of

60
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,440
them produces 9 at
the same time.

61
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,210
So this red line here doesn't
exist, and the situation of

62
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,900
these two planes S and S0 is
this one, they're parallel.

63
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:59,810
So let's add the word
parallel in here.

64
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,640
And let's move on to the other
half of the problem.

65
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,640
The other half said all points
of S have this specific form.

66
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,680
Now let me call this
point here P0.

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,019
If all points of S have this
form, we can plug in any

68
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,640
parameter c1 and c2 here and
we're going to get a

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,040
point of the plane.

70
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:30,270
So in particular, we can plug
in c1 and c2 equal to 0.

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,530
What we get then is that the
point x y z equals P0 is a

72
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:43,890
point of the plane
S. So P0 is in S.

73
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,290
What do we know about
the point P0?

74
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,670
Well the fact that it's in S
means the its coordinates, x

75
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:58,920
minus 5y plus 2z equal 9.

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,620
That's the equation of S. But we
also know that y and z are

77
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,870
equal to 0 and 0.

78
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,310

79
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,510
Solving this system we get that
the x-coordinate of this

80
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:23,235
point P0 is 9, and we
can just add 9 here.

81
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:25,930

82
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,660
So we just have two blanks
left to fill.

83
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,240
Before we'll fill them,
let me show you a

84
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,760
picture that I drew here.

85
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,790
So we have these two planes, S0
and S, which are parallel.

86
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,070
They're given by these
equations.

87
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,410
And the plane S0 has a point 0
in it, because the equation is

88
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,310
x minus 5y plus 2z equals 0,
so it satisfied by 0 0 0.

89
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:59,430
The plane S has this point P0
in it, which is 9 0 0-- we

90
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,970
just figured this out.

91
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,140
And there's this vector
connecting one

92
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,260
plane to the other.

93
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,180
Now, since those two planes are
parallel and there's this

94
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,940
vector going between them, what
we can see is that a good

95
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,820
way to get any point in S is to
go to any point in S0 and

96
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,880
go up by this vector.

97
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,340
Now let me write this down.

98
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:36,350
What I just said is that any
point in S is of the form--

99
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,390
use this vector to go up--

100
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:48,700
plus any point in S0.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,180
And if we compare this to this
expression here, we also get

102
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,930
P0 plus this linear
combination.

103
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:03,130
So this here has to
be a point in S0.

104
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,590
Now we're left with a question
of how to parameterize all

105
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,650
points in S0.

106
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,620
What are all the points in S0,
and what does this problem

107
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,430
have to do with solving
homogeneous linear equations?

108
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,690
Well let me write this equation
of S0 in a slightly

109
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,090
different way.

110
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:35,270
Let me write it as 1, minus
5, 2, x y z, equals 0.

111
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,690
And let me think of this as
a matrix of the system.

112
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,270
It's a very tiny matrix,
but it's a matrix.

113
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,360
And think of it as a matrix
dot a vector equals 0, and

114
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,840
trying to find all solutions
of the system.

115
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,790
Well let's do row
reductions here.

116
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,000
It's already as upper triangular
as these tiny

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,280
matrices get.

118
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,530
This is a pivot.

119
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,330

120
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,255
So we have a pivot variable x.

121
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:05,150

122
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:13,960
These are free variables,
y and z.

123
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,600
And if you remember how to solve
these systems, for each

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
free variable we get one
particular solution.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,690

126
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,470
So we get one particular
solution when we plug in y is

127
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,860
1 and all the other free
variables are 0.

128
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,830
Plugging it in here, we just
get that in that case, x--

129
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:46,990
so we get x minus 5 times 1
plus 2 times 0 equals 0.

130
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,270
So x is equal to 5.

131
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,440
And the other solution is for
setting all free variables

132
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,290
equal to 0, except z which
we set equal to 1.

133
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,940
And then we get x minus
5 times 0 plus 2

134
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,260
times 1 equals 0.

135
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:10,520
So we get that in this case,
x equals minus 2.

136
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,330
And any solution of this system
is going to be of the

137
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,310
form some constant times
this plus some other

138
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,800
constant times this.

139
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,690
And if we walk back to our
original problem here, we see

140
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,730
that these parameters, these
numbers here, have been set up

141
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,250
exactly so that we can just take
these numbers and just

142
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,220
copy them over, 5 and minus 2.

143
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,650
And this is the general form of
any point of the plane S.

144
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,430
It's go up this vector, and then
add a point in S0, in the

145
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,820
parallel plane that passes
through the origin.

146
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,910
This finishes our problem.

147
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,330
But what I would encourage you
to do now is to go on to the

148
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,880
next lecture, watch the next
recitation video, and then

149
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,170
come back here and think about
what is it that we really did

150
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,870
here on this half
of the board.

151
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,120
Thank you.

152
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,178
