00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,214

00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,650
PROFESSOR: Hello, I'm Linan.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,690
Welcome to Recitation
of Linear Algebra.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,290
It's my great pleasure to guide
you through the first

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,930
recitation.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,880
In the first lecture,
we learned

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,940
some important concepts.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,220
We discussed how to view a
linear system of equations

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,230
from different points.

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,720
And we discussed the concepts
such as row picture, column

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,030
picture, and the
form in matrix.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,800
Some of them may
be new to you.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,100
So today, we're going to use
this simple example to review

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,630
those concepts.

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,450
We're going to work with this
simple system of two equations

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,340
with two unknowns.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,670
So I would like you to first
solve it, and then to find out

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,520
the associated row picture
and column

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,240
picture with this system.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,160
After you're done, we're also
going to discuss the matrix

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,890
form of this linear system.

22
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,590
Why don't you pause the video
now and try to work them out

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,240
on your own.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,260
A good suggestion would be,
you can try to sketch your

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,350
answer in an xy coordinate
like this.

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,070
OK, I'll see you in a while.

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:35,440

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,210
I hope you have just had
some fun with it.

29
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,340
Let's work on it together.

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,250
Well, we're going to solve
these equations.

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,910
As you can see, we have
two unknowns, x and y.

32
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,890
And they have to satisfy
these two

33
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,360
equations at the same time.

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,780
How would you solve it?

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,330
A very simple way would
be you substitute x by

36
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,700
y, in terms of y.

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,440
So let's do it this way.

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:14,280
So we use the second equation
to rewrite x as 2y minus 1.

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,090
So 2y minus 1.

40
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,325
Then you plug this into
the first equation.

41
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:24,470

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,420
This implies twice.

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,090
x would be replaced by this.

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:38,886
2 times 2y minus 1 plus
y is equal to 3.

45
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:44,880
When you simplify this equation
here, you will arrive

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:53,180
at that 5y minus 2
is equal to 3.

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,110
That simply tells you
y is equal to 1.

48
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,360
If y is equal to 1, then we
go back to this formula.

49
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,690
We see that x is also
equal to 1.

50
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,550
That's it.

51
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,830
This is the answer to
this linear system.

52
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,400
And it's easy enough.

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,650
Both x and y are 1.

54
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,320
Now, let's try to
find out its row

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,130
picture and column picture.

56
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,200
So I'm going to work on this
xy coordinate here.

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,215
First, let's look
at row picture.

58
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:37,250

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,180
Please review what
a row picture is.

60
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,820
So by row picture, I mean you
have to look at this linear

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,650
system according to each row.

62
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,890
So what is the first row?

63
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,710
Well, the first row is an
equation with two unknowns.

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,630
So 2 times x plus
y is equal to 3.

65
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,000
What is this equation,
exactly?

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,870
As you may remember, this
equation actually gives you a

67
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,610
straight line in xy plane.

68
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,520
So now let's put
the line here.

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:19,779
I want a line that satisfies
2x plus y is 3.

70
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,640
Let's first set x to be 0.

71
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,290
If x is 0, by the first
equation, y should

72
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,220
be 3, which is here.

73
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,220

74
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,980
Now, let's set x to be 1.

75
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,800
If x is 1, then y is also 1.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,940

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,600
So what I have now are two
points on the line.

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,770
And this is enough, because on
the xy plane, two points will

79
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,020
uniquely determine
a straight line.

80
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,110
And that's the line
we're looking for.

81
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,425
So all we need to do is to
connect these two points.

82
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:01,260

83
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,245
We try to draw this
line straight.

84
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:15,020

85
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,290
So this is the line that
is given by 2x plus

86
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,660
y is equal to 3.

87
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,300
This is the easiest way
to determine a line.

88
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,590
You just need to pick two points
that are on the line.

89
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,450
Then you connect them,
and here you have

90
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,640
the straight line.

91
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,660
So that's the first row.

92
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,310
Now let's look at
the second row.

93
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,390
The second row is x minus
2y is equal to -1.

94
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,120
Same thing.

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,870
We're going to locate two points
on the second line.

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,260
So again, let's set x to be
0 first. If x is 0, then y

97
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,550
should be 1/2, right?

98
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,710
So this line has to
cross this point.

99
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,150
That's x, 0, y, 1/2.

100
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,930
Then let's put x
to be 1 again.

101
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,710
So if x is 1, then
y is also 1.

102
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,960
So we're going to use
the same point here.

103
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,770
Now we have two points in the
second line to connect them.

104
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,510
So by connecting them, I will
have my second straight line.

105
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,930

106
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,715
So this is the line
corresponding to

107
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:39,180
x minus 2y is -1.

108
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,800
This is the row picture, because
we have separated the

109
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,450
two equations, and we look
at them respectively.

110
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,130
The first equation gives me
this line, and the second

111
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,000
equation gives me this line.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,150
Then what do I mean by solving
this linear system?

113
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,590
Well, we are putting these two
lines together, and we are

114
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,780
looking at a point which is on
the first line and second line

115
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,050
at the same time.

116
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,670
Then clearly, that's the point
where they intersect, right?

117
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,290
We can see from the answer over
there, the coordinate of

118
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,100
this point should be 1,1.

119
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,370

120
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,110
This is also clear from the
construction of the two lines.

121
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,710
We have noticed that this point
is on the first line and

122
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,210
the second line at
the same time.

123
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,340
Two lines meeting at
the point 1,1.

124
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,460
That's the row picture of
this linear system.

125
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,330
Now, let's move on to
the column picture.

126
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,320
Again, I will need
an xy coordinate.

127
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:59,590

128
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,060
So, where can I find
my columns?

129
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:12,980
If you look at the two
equations, then you focus on

130
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,900
the coefficient in front
of x in both equations.

131
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,340
What would that be?

132
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,060
Well, in the first equation,
I have 2 in front of x.

133
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,940
In the second equation, I
have a 1 in front of x.

134
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:36,010
I want to put them together
as a column vector.

135
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,390
Let me call it V1.

136
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:43,010

137
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,680
And I'm going to do the same
thing to the coefficients in

138
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,180
front of y.

139
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,640
In the first equation, I
have a 1 in front of y.

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,970
In the second equation, I
have a -2 in front of y.

141
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,840
Put them together.

142
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,640
Call it column vector V2.

143
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,930

144
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,360
These are the columns
I'm looking for.

145
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,590
Then what does that
linear system say?

146
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,300
Well, I have extracted the
coefficients in front of x.

147
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,940
Now I can consider x to be the
coefficient of this vector.

148
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,480
And same thing, I'm going to
view y as the coefficient of

149
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,190
this vector.

150
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,600
Then what that linear
system is doing is

151
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,260
just to sum them up.

152
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,710
That gives you the left-hand
side of the linear system.

153
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,060
What is the right-hand side?

154
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,090
Again, you put the two constants
as a column vector,

155
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,770
which is 3, -1.

156
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,630

157
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,460
That is the right-hand side.

158
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,840
So what I'm doing here is I'm
taking the linear combination

159
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,010
of V1 and V2.

160
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,720
And the coefficients are given
by x and y, respectively.

161
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:21,430
And I want the result of this
combination to be 3, -1.

162
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,670
Now let's incorporate this
into this picture.

163
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,480
I have a V1, so I'm going
to draw a vector V1.

164
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,590
x is 2, y is 1, so V1 is here.

165
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,850

166
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,780
That's V1.

167
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,620
And I need a V2.

168
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,740
x is 1.

169
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,030
y is -2.

170
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,560
So that's my V2.

171
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,890

172
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,430
I want to take the sum of
x multiple of V1 and

173
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,350
y multiple of V2.

174
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,970
And I want the result
to be 3, -1.

175
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:15,030
Well, taking a hint from the
previous consideration, we

176
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:21,660
know that both x and
y should be 1.

177
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:30,690
So I'm actually summing one copy
of V1 and one copy of V2.

178
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,430
So how do you indicate the
sum of these two vectors?

179
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,495
You complete the parallelogram
spanned by these two vectors.

180
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:43,090

181
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:51,070
Then the vector given by
the diagonal is the

182
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,380
sum of V1 and V2.

183
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,190
Is this vector going
to be 3, -1?

184
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,800
Well, we can check.

185
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,860
The x-coordinate will be
2 plus 1, which is 3.

186
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,750
That's 2 plus 1, 3.

187
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,000
And the y-coordinate
will be 1 minus 2.

188
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,410
So 1 minus 2, which
should be -1.

189
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,980

190
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,080
That's it.

191
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,840
That's one multiple of V1
and one multiple of V2.

192
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,460
The sum will be 3, -1.

193
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,720
And that's the row picture.

194
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,200
Where does that that
"x is equal to y is

195
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,210
equal to 1" come from?

196
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,820
It comes from solving
the linear system.

197
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,260
It comes from the row picture.

198
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,890

199
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,430
So here, we have found out the
row picture and the column

200
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,990
picture of this linear system.

201
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,580
What I would like to mention
is the matrix form of this

202
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,450
linear system.

203
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,900
So what is the matrix form?

204
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:06,930

205
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,840
What if I put these two column
vectors together?

206
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:18,900
So I want to put them back
to back, V1 and V2.

207
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,590
And I call this matrix to be A.
So if you write it out, A

208
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,675
should be given by
2, 1, 1, -2.

209
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:33,920

210
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,990
Matrix A has V1 and V2 as its
column vectors, and it's a

211
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,360
2-by-2 matrix.

212
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,770
If I consider if I take this
into account, then what will

213
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,260
be the left-hand side of
the linear system?

214
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,000
In other words, what would
be the left-hand

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,130
side of this equation?

216
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,240
This is actually matrix
A multiplying a

217
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,310
vector given by xy.

218
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:12,750
So that's 2, 1, 1, -2,
multiplying x and y.

219
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,970
So you put both unknowns
together as a column vector.

220
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,530
That's the left-hand side
of the equation.

221
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,420
And again, the right-hand side
is given by this column

222
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,544
vector, 3, -1.

223
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:30,330

224
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,260
This is the matrix form
of this linear system.

225
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,700
We can actually solve
this directly.

226
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,810
In other words, we can get this
unknown vector at once,

227
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,100
both x-coordinate and
y-coordinate.

228
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,230

229
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,670
Let's recall, if you have a
scalar equation like this--

230
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,360
let's say a is some constant
times x is

231
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,560
unknown is equal to b--

232
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,060
if a is non-zero,
what would be x?

233
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,770
So clearly, x should
be b over a.

234
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:12,160
I can also write it as
a inverse times b.

235
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,940
That's what we do when
we have numbers.

236
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,500
So here, what we want to
apply is a similar

237
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,590
idea but to a matrix.

238
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:29,170
What you want to find is a
matrix A inverse such that A

239
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:35,840
inverse times A is equal
to an identity matrix

240
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,975
which is 1, 0, 0, 1.

241
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:41,770

242
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,290
This may be new to you, but as
you go further into this

243
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,730
course, this idea will become
more and more natural.

244
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,130
If such an inverse matrix
exists, then what would be

245
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,860
this vector here?

246
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:12,920
Then xy will simply be A
inverse times 3, -1.

247
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,650
That will give you the answer.

248
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,830
Here, I'm not going to go into
detail, but we will return to

249
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,920
this later in this course.

250
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,160
I hope this simple example is
helpful to you in reviewing

251
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,330
what you've learned
in the lecture.

252
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,580
Thank you for watching, and
I'm looking forward

253
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,830
to seeing you again.

254
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,668
