00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,610
PROFESSOR: Hi there.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,370
My name is Ana.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,090
Welcome to recitation.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,510
In lecture, you've been learning
about how to multiply

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,870
matrices, and how to think about
that multiplication in

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,310
different ways, and also about
when a matrix is invertible or

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,850
not, and how to compute the
inverse when it is invertible.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,360
And that's what today's
problem is about.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,140
We have a matrix A that
has variables a and

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,290
b instead of numbers.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,730
And the question is what are the
conditions on a and b that

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,150
make that matrix invertible?

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,550
And when it is invertible,
what is A inverse?

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,700
Why don't you hit Pause and work
on it for a little while.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,430
And then we'll come back and
work on it together.

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:53,910

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,220
And we're back.

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,040
I hope you had success
in solving that.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,730
Let's do it ourselves.

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,650
So, remember from lecture,
we talked about--

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,270
well, Professor Strang talked
about how it's easy to spot--

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,610
some easy tests to spot when
a matrix is not invertible.

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,805
Those were if you have a column
of 0s or a row of 0s,

25
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:20,340
then the matrix is
not invertible.

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,040
But if you have two columns that
are the same, or two rows

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,650
that are the same, the matrix
is also not invertible.

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,260
So let's see if this matrix
satisfies any of those easy

29
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,390
conditions.

30
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,410
Well, here you have
a row of a's.

31
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,330
If a is equal to 0, you have a
row of 0s, the matrix is not

32
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,730
invertible.

33
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,510
So a is--

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:49,952

35
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,420
What was the other one?

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,800
Two of the same column
or of the same row.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,060
Well, if a is equal to b, then
all the entries in the matrix

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,480
are the same.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,700
So all the rows are the same,
all the columns are the same,

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,170
the matrix is not invertible.

41
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,620
So that's the other
easy condition.

42
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:12,750
A is not invertible if a is
equal to 0 or a equals to b.

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,120
There's not any other easy
condition that I can spot.

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,310
So we have to do it in a
more systematic way.

45
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,140
So to do that, actually what we
do is we start with a, we

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,260
try to find its inverse, and if
in the process we run into

47
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,400
something fishy, those
are our conditions.

48
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,060
So remember how to find the
inverse of a matrix?

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:39,380
You start by writing a giant
matrix that has A and the

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,610
identity next to it.

51
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,935
And then you perform elimination
steps until--

52
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:48,130
let's put dots here, because
there's lots of steps--

53
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,450

54
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,740
and you stop once you've reached
the identity matrix on

55
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,450
the left side.

56
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,845
And when you do that, what you
have on the right side will be

57
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,020
your A inverse.

58
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,800
Easy enough.

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,636
So let's do the computations.

60
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:08,130

61
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:20,670
a, b, b, a, a, b, a, a, a, and
my identity matrix next to it.

62
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,700
And now I know you learned about
elimination in the past

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,400
recitation.

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,530
So I'll do the first few steps
slowly, and then I'll just

65
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,140
write the solution for
the last steps.

66
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,290
So we want to eliminate
this a.

67
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,680
We want to turn into 0.

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,300
So let's subtract the first
row from the second.

69
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,190
Let's do row 2 minus row 1, and
write it instead of row 2.

70
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:55,835
So a, b, b, 1, 0, 0, 0, so a
minus a, a minus b, b minus b

71
00:03:55,835 --> 00:04:01,885
is 0, 0 minus 1, 1 minus
0, 0 minus 0.

72
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:04,130
And then we want to do the
same with the third row.

73
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,430
So let's do row 3 minus row 1.

74
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,420
0, a minus b, it doesn't fit.

75
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,470
a minus b.

76
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,339
Can you understand that?

77
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:21,609
And then 0 minus 1, 0
minus 0, 1 minus 0.

78
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,950
All right.

79
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,450
Let's continue up here.

80
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,520

81
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,730
Now I want to eliminate
this a minus b.

82
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,380
I want to turn it into a 0.

83
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,932
So the first row
stays the same.

84
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:46,460
a, b, b, 1, 0, 0, 0, a
minus b, 0, -1, 1, 0.

85
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,240
And now 0 minus 0, a minus
b minus a minus b is 0.

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,790
a minus b minus 0,
that's easy.

87
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,520
-1 minus -1, 0 again.

88
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,240
-1 and 1.

89
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,270
Almost there.

90
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,600
We already have 0s down here.

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,750
It's looking more and more
like the identity matrix.

92
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,120
So we have to turn all these
diagonal entries into one, so

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,370
let's do that now.

94
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,590

95
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,290
1, b over a, b over-- oh.

96
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,850
I'm dividing by a.

97
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,850
a better not be 0.

98
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,750
Let me signal that here.

99
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,825
a different from 0.

100
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,900

101
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,710
1 over a, 0.

102
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,480
0.

103
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,440
0.

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,000
I want to make that into a 1.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,630
So 1 over a minus b, and--

106
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,310
you guessed it-- a minus b has
to be different from 0.

107
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,050

108
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:56,790
0 minus -1 over a minus b.

109
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,570
1 over a minus b.

110
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:05,850
0, 0, 1, 0, -1 over a minus b.

111
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,262
1 over a minus b.

112
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:09,860

113
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

114
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,150
PROFESSOR: Someone's
pointing a mistake.

115
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the (2, 2)
entry, you should have a 1.

116
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,250
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're
absolutely right.

117
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,580

118
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,830
Thank you.

119
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,760

120
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,230
All right.

121
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,580
So not much left to do.

122
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,870
We only have to eliminate
b over a and b over a.

123
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,460
That's a little bit
computationally heavy.

124
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,260
So what do you have to do?

125
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,450
You just have to basically
subtract--

126
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,670
replace row 1 by row 1 minus b
over a times row 2 plus row 3.

127
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,090
Let me write that down.

128
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:59,130
row 1 minus b over a times
row 2 plus row 3.

129
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,540
You want that to go
into your row 1.

130
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,790
These stay the same.

131
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,970

132
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,870
-1 over a minus b.

133
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,590
1 over a minus b.

134
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:21,090

135
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,650
This is where I'm going to go to
my notes and tell you that

136
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:32,390
these numbers are 1 over
a minus b, 0 minus b

137
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,190
over a, a minus b.

138
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,210
That looks pretty awful.

139
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,410
But that is A inverse.

140
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,300
And we're done.

141
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,290
Except it looks terrible.

142
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,260
So let me just write
it in a nicer way.

143
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,460
A inverse equals-- see, you're
dividing everything by a minus

144
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,960
b, so pull out that factor.

145
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,680

146
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:06,120
1, 0, minus b over a,
-1, 1, 0, 0, -1, 1.

147
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,710
Looks much better now.

148
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,870
So here's your A inverse.

149
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,860
And the other question was what
are the conditions on a

150
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,480
and b for the matrix
A to be invertible?

151
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,540
Well, a has to be non-zero,
and a has to be

152
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,850
different from b.

153
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,320
And we're done.

154
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,370
That's it for today.

155
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,620
See you next time.

156
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,360
