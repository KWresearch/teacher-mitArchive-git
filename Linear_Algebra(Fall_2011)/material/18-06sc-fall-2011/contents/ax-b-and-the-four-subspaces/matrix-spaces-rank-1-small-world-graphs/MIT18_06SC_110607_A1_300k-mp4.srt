00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,820
ANA RITA PIRES: Hi there.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,510
Welcome to recitation.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,970
In lecture, you've been learning
about vector spaces

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,210
whose vectors are actually
matrices or functions, and

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,640
this is what our problem
today is about.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,020
We have a set of 2 by 3 matrices
whose null space

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,250
contains the vector 2, 1, 1.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,370
And I want you to show that this
set is actually a vector

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,970
subspace of the space of
all 2 by 3 matrices.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,590
And then, I want you to
find a basis for it.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,150
When you're done, here is
an additional question.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,070
What about the set of those 2
by 3 matrices whose column

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,760
space contains the
vector 2, 1?

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,430
All right.

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,480
Hit pause.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,180
And work on it yourself, and
when you're ready, I'll come

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,824
back and show you
how I did it.

19
00:00:53,824 --> 00:01:01,408

20
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:01,890
Hi.

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,090
I hope you managed
to solve it.

22
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,070
Let's do it.

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,220
So, how do we show that

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,360
something is a vector subspace?

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
Well, there are only two things
that we need to check.

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,780
One is that if two vectors, in
this case two matrices, are in

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,670
that space, then their
sum is in that space.

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,780
And if you take a vector, in
this case a matrix, and you

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,440
multiply by a scalar you'll
still be in the space.

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:37,380
So, suppose that the matrices
A and B are in this set that

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,590
we want to prove
is a subspace.

32
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:47,270
So that means that A times the
vector 2, 1, 1 is equal to the

33
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,710
vector 0, 0.

34
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,050
Notice that the dimensions
I write, A is 2 by 3,

35
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,260
so this 3 by 1.

36
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,470
I should get a 2 by 1.

37
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,320
Suppose that 2, 1, 1 is in the
null space of A, and that 2,

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:12,760
1, 1 is also in the null space
of B. Then what is A plus B

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,190
times 2, 1, 1?

40
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,480
Is 2, 1, 1 in the null
space of A plus B?

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,380
Well, if you think about what
this means, you're just adding

42
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,000
entry by entry.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:34,680
And you can do it slowly on your
own and just check that

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,900
this is what happens.

45
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,790
But by now you are familiar
enough with matrices that this

46
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,810
should not be a surprise.

47
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,220
Well, this is 0, 0, and this is
0, 0, so their sum is 0, 0.

48
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,880
So, indeed, 2, 1, 1, is in the
null space of A plus B. So if

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,260
A and B are in the set, A plus
B is in the set, as well.

50
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,040
Let's check the other thing.

51
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,340
The other thing is A times
2, 1, 1 is 0, 0.

52
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,360
So A is in the set, because 2,
1, 1 is in the null space of

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,675
A. And also, let's let
c be a scalar.

54
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:13,550

55
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,690
That just means that
c is a number.

56
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:23,120
Then we want to check that 2,
1, 1 is in the null space of

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,840
the matrix cA.

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,950
That matrix is just the matrix
A except every entry is

59
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,360
multiplied by the number c.

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,790
Well, again, this is
how matrices work.

61
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,960
You can just pull out the
constant and do A times 2, 1,

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,240
1 first. Now this is
the vector 0, 0.

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,270
So, this will simply be c times
0, 0, which is 0, 0.

64
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,370
So the matrix cA is also
contained in this set.

65
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,220
So the set is closed under
addition and other

66
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,820
multiplication by scalar,
so the set is,

67
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,206
indeed, a vector subspace.

68
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:05,200
Well that takes care of the
first part of the question.

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,880
The second part was find a
basis for the subspace.

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,710
So let's work on that now.

71
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,940
So the condition for a matrix to
be in this subspace is that

72
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,760
the vector 2, 1, 1 is
in the null space.

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,130
So I must have A times 2,
1, 1 is equal to 0, 0.

74
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,210
So what is happening?

75
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,650
Well A is a 2 by 3 matrix.

76
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,410
So you can actually think about
what happens in each row

77
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,520
separately.

78
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,450
You'll have the first row of A
times 2, 1, 1 is equal to 0.

79
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,430
And the second row of A times
2, 1, 1 is equal to 0.

80
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,680
So let's see what that means.

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,230

82
00:04:49,230 --> 00:05:01,120
Each row of the matrix A in this
vector subspace must be

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,410
a, b, c, 2, 1, 1 equal to 0.

84
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,220
This is not really a good
sentence, but you understand.

85
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,770
Which means that--

86
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,990
well let's see--

87
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,460
2 a plus b plus c
is equal to 0.

88
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,565
So I can actually write
it in this format.

89
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:25,320

90
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:39,290
It must be of the form a, b,
and then c must be equal to

91
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,380
-2a minus b.

92
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,810
Right?

93
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,512
So, furthermore, we
can say that it--

94
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:53,500
well, one thing that you can
do-- let me write this

95
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,570
here to help you.

96
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:02,950
It will be a, 0, -2a,
plus 0, b, -b.

97
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,420
See?

98
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,780
So what I'm doing is I'm
splitting this into the linear

99
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,220
combination of two vectors.

100
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,270
I can pull out the a out of this
one, and pull the b out

101
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:20,460
of this one, and it must be
a linear combination--

102
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,390
that's what this means,
linear combination--

103
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,570
of the following--

104
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:31,460
1, 0, -2, and 0, 1, -1.

105
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,000
Does that make sense?

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,820
So this is what each row
of a must satisfy.

107
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,670
So we can now put everything
together into what a basis for

108
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,720
the vector space has to be.

109
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,960
The basis will be, well it's 2
by 3 matrix, and each row must

110
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,820
be a linear combination
of these two vectors.

111
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,900
So let's write that--

112
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,860
1, 0, -2.

113
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,770
I'll keep the second
row with zeros--

114
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,865
0, 1, -1, and I'll keep the
second row of zeros.

115
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:12,700
And now the same, but keeping
the first row with zeros, I'm

116
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:19,710
taking these vectors
on the second row.

117
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,640
So this is a basis for
my vector space.

118
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,100
1, 2, 3, 4 that also means
that the dimension of the

119
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,560
subspace is 4.

120
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,100
There was one further question,
which was what can

121
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,340
you say about the set of those
matrices that contain the

122
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,430
vector 2, 1 in their
column space?

123
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,610

124
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,810
What about the set of those 2
by 3 matrices whose column

125
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,210
space contains the
vector 2, 1.

126
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,460
Is that a vector subspace?

127
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,600

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,340
Well one quick check that you
can always do is check that

129
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,390
the 0 vector, in this case the
0 matrix, belongs to the set.

130
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:13,180
Does the 0, 2 by 3 matrix,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

131
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,800
Does this matrix belong
to this set?

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,840
Does this matrix contain
the vector 2, 1

133
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,540
in its column space?

134
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,490
It does not, so this set cannot
be a vector subspace.

135
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,210
If you want to think about how
this 0 belonging in the set

136
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,570
has anything to do with the two
conditions being closed

137
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,770
under sum and closed under
multiplication by scalar,

138
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,340
simply think that you should
always be able to multiply a

139
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,210
matrix by the scalar 0 and have
it still be in the set.

140
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,040
That will be your 0 matrix.

141
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,060
Well the zero matrix is not in
the set, so the set is not a

142
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,722
vector subspace.

143
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:52,430
All right?

144
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,310
We're done.

145
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,560
Thank you.

146
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,380
