1
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
OK.

2
00:00:13 --> 00:00:22
Uh this is the review lecture
for the first part of the

3
00:00:22 --> 00:00:27
course, the Ax=b part of the
course.

4
00:00:27 --> 00:00:34
And the exam will emphasize
chapter three.

5
00:00:34 --> 00:00:42
Because those are the --0
chapter three was about the

6
00:00:42 --> 00:00:48
rectangular matrices where we
had null spaces and null spaces

7
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
of A transpose,
and ranks, and all the things

8
00:00:52 --> 00:00:58.16
that are so clear when the
matrix is square and invertible,

9
00:00:58.16 --> 00:01:04
they became things to think
about for rectangular matrices.

10
00:01:04 --> 00:01:10
So, and vector spaces and
subspaces and above all those

11
00:01:10 --> 00:01:11.7
four subspaces.

12
00:01:11.7 --> 00:01:17
OK, I'm thinking to start at
least I'll just look at old

13
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
exams, read out questions,
write on the board what I need

14
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
to and we can see what the
answers are.

15
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
The first one I see is one I
can just read out.

16
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
Well, I'll write a little.

17
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
Suppose u, v and w are nonzero
vectors in R^7.

18
00:01:40 --> 00:01:45
What are the possible -- they
span a -- a vector space.

19
00:01:45 --> 00:01:50
They span a subspace of R^7,
and what are the possible

20
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
dimensions?

21
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
So that's a straightforward
question, what are the possible

22
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
dimensions of the subspace
spanned by u,

23
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
v and w?

24
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
OK, one, two,
or three, right.

25
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
One, two or three.

26
00:02:07 --> 00:02:12
Couldn't be more because we've
only got three vectors,

27
00:02:12 --> 00:02:18
and couldn't be zero because --
because I told you the vectors

28
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
were nonzero.

29
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25.46
Otherwise if I allowed the
possibility that those were all

30
00:02:25.46 --> 00:02:31
the zero vector --
then the zero-dimensional

31
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
subspace would have been in
there.

32
00:02:35 --> 00:02:35
OK.

33
00:02:35 --> 00:02:40
Now can I jump to a more
serious question?

34
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
OK.

35
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
We have a five by three matrix.

36
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
And I'm calling it U.

37
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
I'm saying it's in echelon
form.

38
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
And it has three pivots,
r=3.

39
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
Three pivots.

40
00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
OK.

41
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
First question,
what's the null space?

42
00:03:01 --> 00:03:07
What's the null space of this
matrix U, so this matrix is five

43
00:03:07 --> 00:03:13.52
by three, and I find it helpful
to just see visually what five

44
00:03:13.52 --> 00:03:16
by three means,
what that shape is.

45
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
Three columns.

46
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
Three columns in U then,
five rows, three pivots,

47
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
and what's the null space?

48
00:03:26 --> 00:03:33
The null space of U is -- and
it asks for a spec-of course I'm

49
00:03:33 --> 00:03:39
looking for an answer that isn't
just the definition of the null

50
00:03:39 --> 00:03:45.47
space, but is the null space of
this matrix, with this

51
00:03:45.47 --> 00:03:47.5
information.

52
00:03:47.5 --> 00:03:48
And what is it?

53
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
It's only the zero vector.

54
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
Because we're told that the
rank is three,

55
00:03:53 --> 00:03:58
so those three columns must be
independent, no combination --

56
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
of those columns is the zero
vector except -- so the only

57
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
thing in this null space is the
zero vector, and I --

58
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
I could even say what that
vector is, zero,

59
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
zero, zero.

60
00:04:12 --> 00:04:13
That's OK.

61
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
So that's what's in the null
space.

62
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
All right?
let me go on with -- this

63
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
question has multiple parts.

64
00:04:22 --> 00:04:27
What's the -- oh now it asks
you about a ten by three matrix,

65
00:04:27 --> 00:04:32.3
B, which is the matrix U and
two U.

66
00:04:32.3 --> 00:04:40
It actually -- I would probably
be writing R -- and maybe I

67
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
should be writing R here now.

68
00:04:44 --> 00:04:52
This exam goes back a few years
when I emphasized U more than R.

69
00:04:52 --> 00:04:59.67
Now, what's the echelon form
for that matrix?

70
00:04:59.67 --> 00:05:03
So the echelon form,
what's the rank,

71
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
and what's the echelon form?

72
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10.92
Let's suppose this is in
reduced echelon form,

73
00:05:10.92 --> 00:05:14
so that I could be using the
letter R.

74
00:05:14 --> 00:05:20
So I'll ask for the reduced row
echelon form so imagine that

75
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
these are --
U is in reduced row echelon

76
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
form but now I've doubled the
height of the matrix,

77
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
what will happen when we do row
reduction?

78
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
What row reduction will take us
to what matrix here?

79
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
So you start doing elimination.

80
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
You're doing elimination on
single rows.

81
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
But of course we're allowed to
think of blocks.

82
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
So what, well,
what's the answer look like?

83
00:05:57 --> 00:06:04
U and z- or R -- let's -- I'll
stay with this letter U but I'm

84
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
really thinking it's in reduced
form, and zero.

85
00:06:09 --> 00:06:09.76
OK.

86
00:06:09.76 --> 00:06:10
Fine.

87
00:06:10 --> 00:06:14.91
Then it asks oh,
further, it asks about this

88
00:06:14.91 --> 00:06:17
matrix.

89
00:06:17 --> 00:06:18
U, U, U, and zero.

90
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
OK, what's the echelon form of
this?

91
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
So it's just like practice in
thinking through what would row

92
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
elimination, what would row
reduction do.

93
00:06:28 --> 00:06:33
Have I thought this through,
so what -- what are we -- if we

94
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
start doing elimination,
basically we're going to

95
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
subtract these rows from these
--

96
00:06:40 --> 00:06:46
so it's going to take us to U,
U, zero, and minus U,

97
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
I guess, right?

98
00:06:48 --> 00:06:55
Take the thing all the way to R
-- let's suppose U is really R.

99
00:06:55 --> 00:07:02
Suppose that we're really going
for the reduced row echelon

100
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03.06
form.

101
00:07:03.06 --> 00:07:05
Then would we stop there?

102
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07.5
No.

103
00:07:07.5 --> 00:07:11
We would clean out,
we would -- we could use this

104
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15.35
to -- is that right,
can I so I took this row --

105
00:07:15.35 --> 00:07:18
these rows away from these to
get there.

106
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
Now I take these rows away from
these, so that gives me zero.

107
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
There.

108
00:07:24 --> 00:07:28
And now what more would I do if
I'm really shooting for R,

109
00:07:28 --> 00:07:32
the reduced row echelon form?

110
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
I would -- then I want plus
ones in the pivot,

111
00:07:36 --> 00:07:42
so I would multiply through by
minus one to get plus there.

112
00:07:42 --> 00:07:48
So essentially I'm seeing
reduced row echelon form there

113
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54.75
and there, and there's just one
little twist still to go.

114
00:07:54.75 --> 00:07:58
Do you see what that final
twist might be?

115
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02.88
To have if -- if U is in
reduced row echelon form and now

116
00:08:02.88 --> 00:08:06
I'm looking at U,
U, there's one little step to

117
00:08:06 --> 00:08:11
take, this isn't like a big deal
at all, but -- but if I really

118
00:08:11 --> 00:08:17
want this to be in reduced form,
what would I still -- might I

119
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
still have to do?

120
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
I might have some zero rows
here, I might have some zero

121
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
rows here that strictly should
move to the bottom.

122
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
Well, I'm not going to make a
project out of that.

123
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
OK.

124
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
What's the rank of that matrix?

125
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
What's the rank of this matrix
C?

126
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
Given that I know that the
original U has rank three,

127
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46.84
what's the rank of this guy?

128
00:08:46.84 --> 00:08:47
Six, right.

129
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
That has rank six,
I can tell.

130
00:08:50 --> 00:08:55
What was -- what's the rank of
this B, while -- while we're at

131
00:08:55 --> 00:08:55
it?

132
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
The rank of B,
is that six or three?

133
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
Three is right.

134
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
Three is right.

135
00:09:01 --> 00:09:06
Because we actually got it to
where we could just see three

136
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
pivots.

137
00:09:08 --> 00:09:14
OK, and oh, now finally this
easy one, what's the dimension

138
00:09:14 --> 00:09:20
of the null space -- of the null
space of C transpose?

139
00:09:20 --> 00:09:21
Oh, boy.

140
00:09:21 --> 00:09:27
OK, so what do I -- if I want
the dimension of a null space,

141
00:09:27 --> 00:09:33
I want to know the size of the
matrix --

142
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
so what's the size of the
matrix C?

143
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
It looks like it's ten by six,
is it?

144
00:09:41 --> 00:09:46
Ten by six, so C is ten by six,
so m is ten,

145
00:09:46 --> 00:09:51
so C has ten rows,
C transpose has ten columns,

146
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
so there are ten columns there.

147
00:09:54 --> 00:10:01.2
So how many free variables have
I got, once I --

148
00:10:01.2 --> 00:10:06
if I start with the ten columns
in C transpose,

149
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
that's the m for the original
C.

150
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
And what do I subtract off?

151
00:10:12 --> 00:10:12
Six.

152
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
Because we said that was the
rank.

153
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
So I'm left with four.

154
00:10:18 --> 00:10:18
Thanks.

155
00:10:18 --> 00:10:19
OK.

156
00:10:19 --> 00:10:24
So I think that's the right
answer --

157
00:10:24 --> 00:10:31.58
the dimension of the null space
of C transpose would be four.

158
00:10:31.58 --> 00:10:32
Right.

159
00:10:32 --> 00:10:32
OK.

160
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
Yeah.

161
00:10:33 --> 00:10:33
OK.

162
00:10:33 --> 00:10:39
So that's one question,
at least it brought in some --

163
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
some of the dimension counts.

164
00:10:43 --> 00:10:43
OK.

165
00:10:43 --> 00:10:49
Here's another type of
question.

166
00:10:49 --> 00:10:57
I give you an equation,
Ax equals two four two.

167
00:10:57 --> 00:11:03
And I give you the complete
solution.

168
00:11:03 --> 00:11:09
But I don't give you the
matrix.

169
00:11:09 --> 00:11:16
And another -- there's another
vector, zero,

170
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
zero, one.

171
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
OK.

172
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
All right.

173
00:11:22 --> 00:11:27
My first question is what's the
dimension of the row space?

174
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
Of the matrix A?

175
00:11:29 --> 00:11:34
So the main thing that you want
to get from this question is

176
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
that a question could start this
way.

177
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
Sort of backward way.

178
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
By giving you the answer and
not telling you what the problem

179
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
is.

180
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
But we can get a lot of
information, and sometimes we

181
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
can get complete information
about that matrix A.

182
00:11:54 --> 00:11:54
OK.

183
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58.26
So what's the dimension of the
row space of A?

184
00:11:58.26 --> 00:11:59
What's the rank?

185
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
Tell me about what's the size
of the matrix,

186
00:12:03 --> 00:10:48
yeah, just --
These are the things we want to

187
00:10:48 --> 00:08:28
think about, what's the --
what's the shape of the matrix,

188
00:08:28 --> 00:07:56
first of all?

189
00:07:56 --> 00:06:47.34
It certainly has three rows.

190
00:06:47.34 --> 00:05:25.98
But is it a- is it three by
three?

191
00:05:25.98 --> 00:03:15
So the (x)-s that it multiplies
have three components,

192
00:03:15 --> 00:04:08
so that --1
does the matrix have three

193
00:04:08 --> 00:05:00
columns also?

194
00:05:00 --> 00:05:15
Yes.

195
00:05:15 --> 00:08:56
So I'm seeing the same length
in b, three, and also in x.

196
00:08:56 --> 00:10:59
So A is a three by three
matrix.

197
00:10:59 --> 00:12:50
And what's its rank?

198
00:12:50 --> 00:12:55.09
Its rank -- tell me something
about its null space,

199
00:12:55.09 --> 00:13:00
I heard the right answer for
the rank, the rank is one in

200
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
this case.

201
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
Why?

202
00:13:02 --> 00:13:08
Because the dimension of the
null space, so the dimension of

203
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
the null space of A is from
knowing that that's the complete

204
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
solution, it's two.

205
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
I'm seeing two vectors here,
and they're independent in the

206
00:13:22 --> 00:13:27
null space of A,
because they have to be in the

207
00:13:27 --> 00:13:33
null space of A if I'm allowed
to throw into the solution any

208
00:13:33 --> 00:13:38
amount of those vectors,
that tells me that's the null

209
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
space part then.

210
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
So the dimension of the null
space is two,

211
00:13:45 --> 00:13:51
and then I -- of course I know
the dimensions of all the --

212
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
four subspaces.

213
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56.44
Now actually it asks what's the
matrix?

214
00:13:56.44 --> 00:14:01
Well, what's the matrix in this
case?

215
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
Do we want to -- shall I try to
figure that out?

216
00:14:05 --> 00:14:05
Sure.

217
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
Let's -- you'd like me to do
it, OK.

218
00:14:09 --> 00:14:14
So what about the matrix,
or let me at least start it,

219
00:14:14 --> 00:14:14
OK.

220
00:14:14 --> 00:14:19
If A times this x gives two,
four, two, what does that tell

221
00:14:19 --> 00:14:23
me about the matrix A?

222
00:14:23 --> 00:14:28
If A times that x solves that
equation then it tells me that

223
00:14:28 --> 00:14:33
the first column is -- the first
column of A is -- one,

224
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
two, one, right.

225
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
The first column of A has to be
one, two, one,

226
00:14:38 --> 00:14:43
because if I multiply by x,
that's going to multiply just

227
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
the first column,
and give me two,

228
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
four, two.

229
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
And then I've got two more
columns to find,

230
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56.63
and what information have I got
to find them with?

231
00:14:56.63 --> 00:14:58
I've got the null space.

232
00:14:58 --> 00:15:03
So the fact that this is in the
null space, what does that tell

233
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
me about the matrix?

234
00:15:06 --> 00:15:11
A matrix that has zero,
zero, one in its null space?

235
00:15:11 --> 00:15:16
That tells me that the last
column of the matrix is zeroes.

236
00:15:16 --> 00:15:22
Because this is in the null
space, the last column has to be

237
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
zeroes.

238
00:15:23 --> 00:15:30
And because this is in the null
space, what's the second column?

239
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
Well, this in the null space
means that if I multiply A by

240
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
that vector I must be getting
zeroes, so I think that better

241
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
be minus one,
minus two, and minus one.

242
00:15:41 --> 00:15:41
OK.

243
00:15:41 --> 00:15:46.04
That's a type of question that
just brings out the information

244
00:15:46.04 --> 00:15:49.2
that's in that complete
solution.

245
00:15:49.2 --> 00:15:49
OK.

246
00:15:49 --> 00:15:56
And then actually I go on to
ask what vectors -- for what

247
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
vectors B can Ax=b be solved?

248
00:16:00 --> 00:16:08
Ax=b can be solved if what --
so I'm looking for a condition

249
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
on b, if any.

250
00:16:10 --> 00:16:17
Can it be solved for every
right-hand side b?

251
00:16:17 --> 00:16:07
No.

252
00:16:07 --> 00:15:21
Definitely not.

253
00:15:21 --> 00:14:08
When could it be solved?

254
00:14:08 --> 00:11:35
Well, what's the ---- I
actually say in this in the

255
00:11:35 --> 00:10:18
exam, don't just tell me.

256
00:10:18 --> 00:07:23
If b is in the -- and what
would -- what does the exam say

257
00:07:23 --> 00:06:38
there?1

258
00:06:38 --> 00:09:10
In the column space,
because I do know that it can

259
00:09:10 --> 00:11:37
be solved exactly when B is in
the column space,

260
00:11:37 --> 00:14:38
so I guess I'm asking you what
is the column space for this

261
00:14:38 --> 00:15:00
matrix?

262
00:15:00 --> 00:17:04
So what is if b has the form --
so I guess I'm asking what's

263
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
the column space of this matrix,
and what is it?

264
00:17:07 --> 00:17:12
It's so the column space of
that matrix is all multiples b

265
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
-- b is a multiple of one,
two, one.

266
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
Right?

267
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
I can solve the thing if it's a
multiple of one,

268
00:17:19 --> 00:17:24
two, one, and of course sure
enough --

269
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30
yeah, that was a multiple of
one, two, one,

270
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
and so I had a solution.

271
00:17:34 --> 00:17:43
So this is a case where we've
got lots of null space.

272
00:17:43 --> 00:17:50
Let me just recall rank is big,
don't forget those cases,

273
00:17:50 --> 00:17:58
don't forget the other cases
when r is as big as it can be,

274
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
r equal m or r equal n.

275
00:18:01 --> 00:18:06
Those are -- we had a full
lecture on that,

276
00:18:06 --> 00:18:10
the full rank,
full lecture,

277
00:18:10 --> 00:18:15
and important -- important
case.

278
00:18:15 --> 00:18:15
OK.

279
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
I'll just move on.

280
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
I think this is the best type
of review.

281
00:18:22 --> 00:18:26
It's just brings these ideas
out.

282
00:18:26 --> 00:18:33
Apologies to the camera while I
recover glasses and exam.

283
00:18:33 --> 00:18:33
OK.

284
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38.5
How about a few true-false
ones?

285
00:18:38.5 --> 00:18:42
Actually there won't be a
true-false on the quiz.

286
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
But it gives us a moment of
quick review.

287
00:18:46 --> 00:18:47
Here's one.

288
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
If the null space -- I have a
square matrix.

289
00:18:50 --> 00:18:55
If its null space is just the
zero vector, what about the null

290
00:18:55 --> 00:18:58
space of A transpose?

291
00:18:58 --> 00:19:03
If the null space of A is just
the zero vector,

292
00:19:03 --> 00:19:08
and the matrix is square,
what do I know about the null

293
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
space of A transpose?

294
00:19:10 --> 00:19:12
Also the zero vector.

295
00:19:12 --> 00:19:13
Good.

296
00:19:13 --> 00:19:16
And that's a very very
important fact.

297
00:19:16 --> 00:19:17
OK.

298
00:19:17 --> 00:19:19
How about this?

299
00:19:19 --> 00:19:24
These -- look at the space of
five by five matrices as a

300
00:19:24 --> 00:19:25
vector space.

301
00:19:25 --> 00:19:30
So it's actually a
twenty-five-dimensional vector

302
00:19:30 --> 00:19:31
space.

303
00:19:31 --> 00:19:33
All five by five matrices.

304
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
Look at the invertible
matrices.

305
00:19:36 --> 00:19:38
Do they form a subspace?

306
00:19:38 --> 00:19:44
So I have this five by --
a space of all five by five

307
00:19:44 --> 00:19:45
matrices.

308
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49.64
I can add them,
I can multiply by numbers.

309
00:19:49.64 --> 00:19:53.81
But now I narrow down to the
invertible ones.

310
00:19:53.81 --> 00:19:56
And I ask are they a subspace?

311
00:19:56 --> 00:20:01
And you -- your answer is --
quiet, but nevertheless

312
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
definite, no.

313
00:20:03 --> 00:20:04.11
Right?

314
00:20:04.11 --> 00:20:04
No.

315
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
Because if I add two invertible
matrices I have no idea if the

316
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
answer is invertible.

317
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
If I multiply that invertible
-- well, it doesn't even have

318
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
the zero matrix in it,
it couldn't be a subspace.

319
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
I have to be able to multiply
by zero --

320
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
and stay in my subspace,
and the invertible ones

321
00:20:24 --> 00:20:25
wouldn't work.

322
00:20:25 --> 00:20:28
Well, the singular ones
wouldn't work either.

323
00:20:28 --> 00:20:31
They have zero -- the zero
matrix is in the singular

324
00:20:31 --> 00:20:35
matrices, but if I add two
singular matrices I don't know

325
00:20:35 --> 00:20:38
if the answer is singular or
not.

326
00:20:38 --> 00:20:38
OK.

327
00:20:38 --> 00:20:41
So another true-false.

328
00:20:41 --> 00:20:46
If b squared equals zero then b
equals zero.

329
00:20:46 --> 00:20:48
True or false?

330
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
If b squared equals zero,
true, false?

331
00:20:52 --> 00:20:59
b squared equals zero,
b has to be a square --

332
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
square matrix,
so that I can multiply it by

333
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
itself, does that imply that B
is zero?

334
00:21:08 --> 00:21:15
Are there matrices whose square
could be the zero matrix?

335
00:21:15 --> 00:21:16
Yes or no?

336
00:21:16 --> 00:21:18
Yes there are.

337
00:21:18 --> 00:21:25
There are matrices whose square
is the zero matrix.

338
00:21:25 --> 00:21:27
So this statement is false.

339
00:21:27 --> 00:21:32
If b squared is zero,
we don't know that b is zero.

340
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
For example -- the best example
is that matrix.

341
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
That matrix is a dangerous
matrix.

342
00:21:39 --> 00:21:44
It will come up in later parts
of this course as an example of

343
00:21:44 --> 00:21:47
what can go wrong.

344
00:21:47 --> 00:22:00
And here is a real simple -- so
this -- so if I square that

345
00:22:00 --> 00:22:12
matrix, I do get the zero
matrix,and it shows --

346
00:22:12 --> 00:22:13
OK.

347
00:22:13 --> 00:22:20.86
A system of m equations in m
unknowns is solvable for every

348
00:22:20.86 --> 00:22:27.04
right-hand side if the columns
are independent.

349
00:22:27.04 --> 00:22:27
OK.

350
00:22:27 --> 00:22:34
So can I say that again,
I'm -- I'll write it down then

351
00:22:34 --> 00:20:45
for short.
m by m matrix independent

352
00:20:45 --> 00:16:58
columns then the question is
does Ax=b, is it always

353
00:16:58 --> 00:16:18
solvable?

354
00:16:18 --> 00:13:25
And the answer is -- yes or no
-- right.

355
00:13:25 --> 00:08:53
OK, which -- did you watch that
quiz, there was a quiz program

356
00:08:53 --> 00:05:59
on TV for a few weeks,
did you see that,

357
00:05:59 --> 00:03:09.8
what was the name of that --2
winning a million dollars or

358
00:03:09.8 --> 00:03:11
something?

359
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
How to be a millionaire?

360
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
It was some crazy guy,
what was his name?

361
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
It's -- Regis,
right.

362
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
Regis.

363
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
OK.2

364
00:03:25 --> 00:07:00
If you saw this,
like when you should have been

365
00:07:00 --> 00:11:42.18
doing linear algebra of course
-- but I didn't have to do the

366
00:11:42.18 --> 00:16:09
homework, so I was watching it,
so there were three -- the

367
00:16:09 --> 00:20:50
interesting -- the novel point
was there were three ways that

368
00:20:50 --> 00:23:44.5
you could get help,
right --

369
00:23:44.5 --> 00:23:47
but you could only use each way
once, so you couldn't like use

370
00:23:47 --> 00:23:48
them all the time.

371
00:23:48 --> 00:23:49
So remember that?

372
00:23:49 --> 00:23:52
You could -- so you could poll
the audience,

373
00:23:52 --> 00:23:55.52
and that was a very -- that was
a hundred percent successful

374
00:23:55.52 --> 00:23:57
way, so I'll poll the audience
on this.

375
00:23:57 --> 00:24:01
If the other possibility --
another possibility you could

376
00:24:01 --> 00:24:04
call your friend,
right, or he's your friend

377
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
until he gives you the wrong
answer, which -- that turned out

378
00:24:08 --> 00:24:11
to be very unreliable,
you know, you'd call up your

379
00:24:11 --> 00:24:15.71
brother or something and ask him
for the capital of whatever,

380
00:24:15.71 --> 00:24:16
Bosnia.

381
00:24:16 --> 00:24:24
What does he know,
he makes some guess,

382
00:24:24 --> 00:24:34
matrix, independent columns,
is Ax=b always solvable?

383
00:24:34 --> 00:24:39
Maybe just hands up for that?

384
00:24:39 --> 00:24:40
A few.

385
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
And who says no?

386
00:24:42 --> 00:24:48
Oh, gosh, this audience is not
reliable.

387
00:24:48 --> 00:24:50
Fifty fifty.

388
00:24:50 --> 00:24:56
I guess I'd say,
I'd vote yes.

389
00:24:56 --> 00:25:01
Because independent columns,
that means that the rank is the

390
00:25:01 --> 00:25:05
full size m, I have a matrix of
rank m.

391
00:25:05 --> 00:25:10
That means it's -- I mean it's
square, so it's an invertible

392
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
matrix, and nothing could go
wrong.

393
00:25:13 --> 00:25:14
Yes.

394
00:25:14 --> 00:25:22
So that's the good case and we
always expect it in chapter two,

395
00:25:22 --> 00:25:29
but of course chapter three is
-- only one of the

396
00:25:29 --> 00:25:31
possibilities.

397
00:25:31 --> 00:25:31
OK.

398
00:25:31 --> 00:25:38
Let me move on to another
question from an old quiz.

399
00:25:38 --> 00:25:40
OK.

400
00:25:40 --> 00:25:40
OK.

401
00:25:40 --> 00:25:42.42
Let's see.

402
00:25:42.42 --> 00:25:42
OK.

403
00:25:42 --> 00:25:52.28
I'm going to give you a matrix,
but I'm going to give it to you

404
00:25:52.28 --> 00:25:58
as a product of a couple of
matrices, one,

405
00:25:58 --> 00:26:03
one, zero, zero,
one, zero, one,

406
00:26:03 --> 00:26:09
zero, one, times another
matrix, one, zero,

407
00:26:09 --> 00:26:14
minus one, two,
zero, one, one,

408
00:26:14 --> 00:26:20
minus one, and all zeroes.

409
00:26:20 --> 00:26:05
OK.

410
00:26:05 --> 00:21:55
I would like to ask you
questions about that matrix

411
00:21:55 --> 00:17:10
without doing the multiplication
and finding the matrix b.

412
00:17:10 --> 00:12:10
Can you tell me something -- so
I'll ask questions about this

413
00:12:10 --> 00:06:45
matrix b and I'll answer them
without multiplying it out.2

414
00:06:45 --> 00:11:38
For example,
I'm going to ask you for a

415
00:11:38 --> 00:14:52
basis for the null space.

416
00:14:52 --> 00:18:21.17
A basis for the null space.

417
00:18:21.17 --> 00:22:59
So I'm going to solve Bx equals
zero.

418
00:22:59 --> 00:27:10
So give me a basis for --
for the null space of B.

419
00:27:10 --> 00:27:17
Let's see, what dimension I in
-- the null space of B is a

420
00:27:17 --> 00:27:19
subspace of R.

421
00:27:19 --> 00:27:24
What size vectors I looking for
here?

422
00:27:24 --> 00:27:32
Because if we don't know the
size, we aren't going to find

423
00:27:32 --> 00:27:37.32
it, right?
the null -- this matrix is

424
00:27:37.32 --> 00:27:39
three by four obviously.

425
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
So if we're looking for the
null space we're looking for

426
00:27:45 --> 00:27:47
those vectors x in R^4.

427
00:27:47 --> 00:27:48
OK.

428
00:27:48 --> 00:27:53
So the null space of B is
certainly a subspace of R^4.

429
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57.94
What do you think its dimension
is?

430
00:27:57.94 --> 00:28:02
Of course once we find the
basis we would know the

431
00:28:02 --> 00:28:05
dimension immediately,
but let's stop first,

432
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
what's the rank of this matrix
B?

433
00:28:08 --> 00:28:12
Let's see, what -- is that
matrix invertible,

434
00:28:12 --> 00:28:13
that square one there?

435
00:28:13 --> 00:28:16
Let's say sure,
I think it is,

436
00:28:16 --> 00:28:20
yes, that matrix B looks
invertible.

437
00:28:20 --> 00:28:22
Is that pretty clear?

438
00:28:22 --> 00:28:23
Yeah.

439
00:28:23 --> 00:28:23
Yeah.

440
00:28:23 --> 00:28:28
So I've gone wrong in this
course already,

441
00:28:28 --> 00:28:33
but I'll still hope that that
matrix is invertible.

442
00:28:33 --> 00:28:40
Yeah, yeah, because if I look
for a combination of those three

443
00:28:40 --> 00:28:44
columns --
well, I couldn't use this

444
00:28:44 --> 00:28:49
middle column because it would
have a one and in a position

445
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
that I -- column is otherwise
all zero, so a combination that

446
00:28:53 --> 00:28:58
gives zero can't give us that
problem, and then the other two

447
00:28:58 --> 00:29:03
are clearly independent sets --
so that matrix is invertible.

448
00:29:03 --> 00:29:08
Later we could take a
determinant or other things.

449
00:29:08 --> 00:29:08.5
OK.

450
00:29:08.5 --> 00:29:09.99
What's the setup?

451
00:29:09.99 --> 00:29:14
If I have an invertible matrix,
a nice invertible square

452
00:29:14 --> 00:29:19
matrix, times this guy,
times this second factor,

453
00:29:19 --> 00:29:23
and I'm looking for the null
space, does this have any

454
00:29:23 --> 00:29:25
effect?

455
00:29:25 --> 00:29:32
Is the null -- so what I'm
asking is is the null space of B

456
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
the same as the null space of
just this part?

457
00:29:37 --> 00:29:38
I think so.

458
00:29:38 --> 00:29:39
I think so.

459
00:29:39 --> 00:29:44
If Bx is zero,
then multiplying by that guy

460
00:29:44 --> 00:29:48.5
I'll still have zero.

461
00:29:48.5 --> 00:29:53
But also if this times some x
give zero, I could always

462
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
multiply on the left by the
inverse of that,

463
00:29:57 --> 00:30:03
because it is invertible,
and I would discover that this

464
00:30:03 --> 00:30:05
kind of Bx is zero.

465
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
You want me to write some of
that down --

466
00:30:09 --> 00:30:15
if I have a product here,
C times -- times D,

467
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
say, and if C is invertible,
the null space of CD,

468
00:30:21 --> 00:30:26.6
well, it will the same as the
null space of D.

469
00:30:26.6 --> 00:30:28
If C is invertible.

470
00:30:28 --> 00:30:36.04
Multiplying by an invertible
matrix on the left can't change

471
00:30:36.04 --> 00:30:37
the null space.

472
00:30:37 --> 00:30:39
OK.

473
00:30:39 --> 00:30:44
So basically I'm asking you for
the null space of this.

474
00:30:44 --> 00:30:48
I don't have to do the
multiplication because I have C

475
00:30:48 --> 00:30:49
is invertible.

476
00:30:49 --> 00:30:52.52
That first factor C is
invertible.

477
00:30:52.52 --> 00:30:55
It's not going to change the
null space.

478
00:30:55 --> 00:30:56.9
OK.

479
00:30:56.9 --> 00:31:02
So can we just write down a
basis now for the null space?

480
00:31:02 --> 00:31:07
So what's the basis for the
null space of -- of that?

481
00:31:07 --> 00:31:13
So basis for the null space I'm
looking for the two -- there are

482
00:31:13 --> 00:31:16
two pivot columns obviously.

483
00:31:16 --> 00:31:19.5
It clearly has rank two.

484
00:31:19.5 --> 00:31:23
I'm looking for the two special
solutions.

485
00:31:23 --> 00:31:27
They'll come from the third and
the fourth.

486
00:31:27 --> 00:31:29
The free variables.

487
00:31:29 --> 00:31:32
OK.
so if the third free variable

488
00:31:32 --> 00:31:38
is a one, then I think probably
I need a minus one there and a

489
00:31:38 --> 00:31:41
one there, it looks like.

490
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
Do you agree that if I then do
that multiplication I'll get

491
00:31:45 --> 00:31:45
zero?

492
00:31:45 --> 00:31:49.2
And if I have one in the fourth
variable, then maybe I need a

493
00:31:49.2 --> 00:31:52
one in the second variable and
maybe a minus two in the third.

494
00:31:52 --> 00:31:56
So I just reasoned that through
and then if I look back I see

495
00:31:56 --> 00:31:59
sure enough that the free
variable part that I sometimes

496
00:31:59 --> 00:32:04.09
call F, that up --
that two by two corner,

497
00:32:04.09 --> 00:32:08
is sitting here with all its
signs reversed.

498
00:32:08 --> 00:32:15
So that's -- here I'm seeing
minus F, and here I'm seeing the

499
00:32:15 --> 00:32:19.41
identity in the null space
matrix.

500
00:32:19.41 --> 00:32:23
OK, so that's the null space.

501
00:32:23 --> 00:32:30
Another question is solve Bx
equal one, zero,

502
00:32:30 --> 00:32:31
one.

503
00:32:31 --> 00:32:31
OK.

504
00:32:31 --> 00:32:39
So that's one question,
now solve complete solutions.

505
00:32:39 --> 00:32:44
To Bx equal one,
zero, one.

506
00:32:44 --> 00:32:44
OK.

507
00:32:44 --> 00:32:52
Yeah, so I guess I'm seeing if
I wanted to get one,

508
00:32:52 --> 00:32:58
zero, one -
What's our particular solution?

509
00:32:58 --> 00:33:03
So I'm looking for a particular
solution and then the null space

510
00:33:03 --> 00:33:03
part.

511
00:33:03 --> 00:33:03.77
OK.

512
00:33:03.77 --> 00:33:08
I-- actually the first column
of B, so what's the first column

513
00:33:08 --> 00:33:09
of our matrix B?

514
00:33:09 --> 00:33:11.88
It's the vector one,
zero, one.

515
00:33:11.88 --> 00:33:17
The first column of our matrix
agrees with the right-hand side.

516
00:33:17 --> 00:33:22
So I guess I'm thinking x
particular plus x null space

517
00:33:22 --> 00:33:28
will be the particular solution,
since the first column of B is

518
00:33:28 --> 00:33:30.58
exactly right,
that's great.

519
00:33:30.58 --> 00:33:35
And then I have C times that
first null space vector and D

520
00:33:35 --> 00:33:39
times the other null space
vector.

521
00:33:39 --> 00:33:40
Right?

522
00:33:40 --> 00:33:44
The two -- the null space part
of the solution,

523
00:33:44 --> 00:33:49
as always has the arbitrary
constants, the particular

524
00:33:49 --> 00:33:53
solution doesn't have any
arbitrary constants,

525
00:33:53 --> 00:33:59
it's one particular solution,
and in this case it'll --

526
00:33:59 --> 00:34:02
that one would do.

527
00:34:02 --> 00:34:02
OK.

528
00:34:02 --> 00:34:07.03
Fine.
so those are questions taken

529
00:34:07.03 --> 00:34:13
from old quizzes,
any questions coming to mind?

530
00:34:13 --> 00:34:14
Yeah.

531
00:34:14 --> 00:34:16
Q: value.

532
00:34:16 --> 00:34:16
OK.

533
00:34:16 --> 00:34:24
Well, so that particular x
particular, it says that let's

534
00:34:24 --> 00:34:33
see, when I multiply by this
guy, I'm going to get the first

535
00:34:33 --> 00:34:34
column of B.

536
00:34:34 --> 00:34:38
That --
if that's a solution,

537
00:34:38 --> 00:34:41
I multiply B,
B times this x will be the

538
00:34:41 --> 00:34:45
first column of B,
and so I'm saying that the

539
00:34:45 --> 00:34:49
first column of this B agrees
with the right-hand side.

540
00:34:49 --> 00:34:55
So I'm saying that look at the
first column of that matrix B.

541
00:34:55 --> 00:34:58
If you do the multiplication,
it's -- so what's the first

542
00:34:58 --> 00:35:00
column of that matrix?

543
00:35:00 --> 00:35:02
Is that how you do that
multiplication?

544
00:35:02 --> 00:35:05
I multiply that matrix by that
first column.

545
00:35:05 --> 00:35:07
And it picks out one,
zero, one.

546
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
So the first column of B is
exactly that.

547
00:35:11 --> 00:35:22
And therefore a particular
solution will be this guy.

548
00:35:22 --> 00:35:23
Yeah.

549
00:35:23 --> 00:35:23.95
OK.

550
00:35:23.95 --> 00:35:24
Yes.

551
00:35:24 --> 00:35:30
Q: particular solution.

552
00:35:30 --> 00:35:40
Any of the solutions can be the
particular one that we pick out.

553
00:35:40 --> 00:35:48
So like this plus -- plus this
would be another particular

554
00:35:48 --> 00:35:49
solution.

555
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
It would be another solution.

556
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58.93
The particular is just telling
us only take one.

557
00:35:58.93 --> 00:36:03
But it's not telling us which
one we have to take.

558
00:36:03 --> 00:36:06
We take the most convenient
one.

559
00:36:06 --> 00:36:10
I guess in this -- in this
problem that was that one.

560
00:36:10 --> 00:36:11.36
Good.

561
00:36:11.36 --> 00:36:12
Other questions?

562
00:36:12 --> 00:36:14
Yes.

563
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
And this pattern of particular
plus null space,

564
00:36:18 --> 00:36:22
of course, that's going
throughout mathematics of linear

565
00:36:22 --> 00:36:23
systems.

566
00:36:23 --> 00:36:28
We're really doing mathematics
of linear systems here.

567
00:36:28 --> 00:36:33
Our systems are discrete and
they're finite-dimensional --

568
00:36:33 --> 00:36:38
and so it's linear algebra,
but this particular plus null

569
00:36:38 --> 00:36:43
space goes -- that doesn't
depend on having finite matrices

570
00:36:43 --> 00:36:47
-- that spreads much -- that
spreads everywhere.

571
00:36:47 --> 00:36:51.92
OK, I'm going to just like to
encourage you to take problems

572
00:36:51.92 --> 00:36:56
out of the book,
let me do the same myself.

573
00:36:56 --> 00:37:00
OK well here's some easy true
or falses.

574
00:37:00 --> 00:37:05
I don't know why the author put
these in here.

575
00:37:05 --> 00:37:05
OK.

576
00:37:05 --> 00:37:11
If m=n, then the row space
equals the column space.

577
00:37:11 --> 00:37:15
So these are true or falses.

578
00:37:15 --> 00:37:18
If m equals n,
so that means the matrix is

579
00:37:18 --> 00:37:23
square, then the row space
equals the column space?

580
00:37:23 --> 00:37:24
False, good.

581
00:37:24 --> 00:37:27.49
Good, what is equal there?

582
00:37:27.49 --> 00:37:31
What can I say is equal,
if M -- well,

583
00:37:31 --> 00:37:31
yeah.

584
00:37:31 --> 00:37:36
Yeah it -- so that's definitely
false --

585
00:37:36 --> 00:37:41
the row space and the column
space, and this matrix is like

586
00:37:41 --> 00:37:43
always a good example to
consider.

587
00:37:43 --> 00:37:48
So there's a square matrix but
it's row space is the multiples

588
00:37:48 --> 00:37:51
of zero, one,
and its column space is the

589
00:37:51 --> 00:37:53
multiples of one,
zero.

590
00:37:53 --> 00:37:55
Very different.

591
00:37:55 --> 00:37:59
The row space and the column
space are totally different for

592
00:37:59 --> 00:38:00
that matrix.

593
00:38:00 --> 00:38:04
Now of course if the matrix was
symmetric, well,

594
00:38:04 --> 00:38:08
then clearly the row space
equals the column space.

595
00:38:08 --> 00:38:08
OK.

596
00:38:08 --> 00:38:10
How about this question?

597
00:38:10 --> 00:38:15
The matrices A and minus A
share the same four subspaces?

598
00:38:15 --> 00:38:20
Do the matrices A and minus A
have the same column space,

599
00:38:20 --> 00:38:25
do they have the same null
space, do they have the same row

600
00:38:25 --> 00:38:25
space?

601
00:38:25 --> 00:38:28
What's the answer on that?

602
00:38:28 --> 00:38:29
Yes or no.

603
00:38:29 --> 00:38:29
Yes.

604
00:38:29 --> 00:38:30
Good.

605
00:38:30 --> 00:38:30
OK.

606
00:38:30 --> 00:38:31
How about this?

607
00:38:31 --> 00:38:37.2
If A and B have the same four
subspaces, then A is a multiple

608
00:38:37.2 --> 00:38:38
of B.

609
00:38:38 --> 00:38:44
If -- suppose those subspaces
are the same.

610
00:38:44 --> 00:38:47
Then is A a multiple of B?

611
00:38:47 --> 00:38:48.13
OK.

612
00:38:48.13 --> 00:38:53
How how do you answer a
question like that?

613
00:38:53 --> 00:39:01
Of course if you want to answer
it yes, then I would --

614
00:39:01 --> 00:39:04
then they'd have to think of a
reason why.

615
00:39:04 --> 00:39:09
If you want to answer no way,
then you would -- and I would

616
00:39:09 --> 00:39:13
sort of like first I would try
to think no, I would say can I

617
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
come up with an example where it
isn't true?

618
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
Let me repeat the question.

619
00:39:20 --> 00:35:44
And then write the answer.

620
00:35:44 --> 00:35:19
OK.

621
00:35:19 --> 00:31:19
So I'll repeat that question.

622
00:31:19 --> 00:24:07
If -- so true or false,
if A and B have the same four

623
00:24:07 --> 00:18:44
subspaces, then A is some
multiple of B.

624
00:18:44 --> 00:13:04
True or false,
how do you feel about it at

625
00:13:04 --> 00:09:54
this instant?3

626
00:09:54 --> 00:15:12.39
There's quite a few trues,
shall I take a poll,

627
00:15:12.39 --> 00:17:51
so how many think true?

628
00:17:51 --> 00:18:12
OK.

629
00:18:12 --> 00:23:09
I gave you every chance to
think about that.

630
00:23:09 --> 00:24:19.19
Let's see.

631
00:24:19.19 --> 00:30:39
So what -- I would just take
extreme cases if it was me,

632
00:30:39 --> 00:37:07
so when do I know -- well,
I would say suppose the matrix

633
00:37:07 --> 00:40:23
is invertible --
suppose A is an invertible

634
00:40:23 --> 00:40:28
matrix, then what -- suppose
it's six by six invertible

635
00:40:28 --> 00:40:32
matrix, then what's its row
space, and its column space is

636
00:40:32 --> 00:40:37
all of R^6, and the null space,
and the null space of A

637
00:40:37 --> 00:40:40
transpose would be the zero
vector.

638
00:40:40 --> 00:40:46
So every invertible matrix is
going to give that answer.

639
00:40:46 --> 00:40:49
If I have a six by six
invertible matrix,

640
00:40:49 --> 00:40:52.8
I know what those subspaces
are.

641
00:40:52.8 --> 00:40:58
Heck, that was back in chapter
two, when I didn't even know

642
00:40:58 --> 00:41:00
what subspaces were.

643
00:41:00 --> 00:41:05
The row space and column space
are both all six-dimensional

644
00:41:05 --> 00:41:08
space --
the whole space,

645
00:41:08 --> 00:41:11
and the rank is six,
in other words,

646
00:41:11 --> 00:41:14
and the null spaces have zero
dimension.

647
00:41:14 --> 00:41:16
So do you see now the answer?

648
00:41:16 --> 00:41:18
So A and B could be.

649
00:41:18 --> 00:41:23
So A and B could be for example
any -- so I'm going to say

650
00:41:23 --> 00:41:23
false.

651
00:41:23 --> 00:41:28
Because A and B for example --
So an example:

652
00:41:28 --> 00:41:34
A and B any invertible six by
six, six by six.

653
00:41:34 --> 00:41:41
So those would have the same
four subspaces but they wouldn't

654
00:41:41 --> 00:41:42
be the same.

655
00:41:42 --> 00:41:50
Of course th- there should be
something about those matrices

656
00:41:50 --> 00:41:54
that would be the same.

657
00:41:54 --> 00:41:58
It's sort of a natural problem,
so now actually we're getting

658
00:41:58 --> 00:41:59
to a math question.

659
00:41:59 --> 00:42:02
The answer is this is not true.

660
00:42:02 --> 00:42:06
One matrix doesn't have to be a
multiple of the other.

661
00:42:06 --> 00:42:09
But there must be something
that's true.

662
00:42:09 --> 00:42:14
And that would be sort of like
a natural question to ask.

663
00:42:14 --> 00:42:27
If they have the same
subspaces, same four subspaces,

664
00:42:27 --> 00:42:38
then what -- what could you --
instinct wasn't necessarily

665
00:42:38 --> 00:42:39
right.

666
00:42:39 --> 00:42:43
But I hope you now see that the
correct answer is false.

667
00:42:43 --> 00:42:47
And then you might think OK,
well, they certainly do have

668
00:42:47 --> 00:42:48
the same rank.

669
00:42:48 --> 00:42:52.62
But do -- obviously if they
have the same four subspaces,

670
00:42:52.62 --> 00:42:55
they have the same rank.

671
00:42:55 --> 00:43:00
I might say if they have the
well, I could extend that

672
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
question and think about other
possibilities and finally come

673
00:43:06 --> 00:43:10
up with something that was true.

674
00:43:10 --> 00:43:12
But I won't press that one.

675
00:43:12 --> 00:43:17
Let me keep going with practice
questions.

676
00:43:17 --> 00:43:23
And these practice questions
are quite appropriate I think

677
00:43:23 --> 00:43:24
for the exam.

678
00:43:24 --> 00:43:26.21
OK.
let's see.

679
00:43:26.21 --> 00:43:31.96
If I exchange two rows of A
which subspaces stay the same?

680
00:43:31.96 --> 00:43:37
So I'm trying to take out
questions that we can answer

681
00:43:37 --> 00:43:42.25
without you know we can answer
quickly.

682
00:43:42.25 --> 00:43:47
If I have a matrix A,
and I exchange two of its rows,

683
00:43:47 --> 00:43:50
which subspaces stay the same?

684
00:43:50 --> 00:43:53
The row space does stay the
same.

685
00:43:53 --> 00:43:57
And the null space stays the
same.

686
00:43:57 --> 00:43:57
Good.

687
00:43:57 --> 00:43:58
Good.

688
00:43:58 --> 00:43:59
Correct.

689
00:43:59 --> 00:44:03
Column space would be a wrong
answer.

690
00:44:03 --> 00:44:07.85
OK.
all right, here's a question.

691
00:44:07.85 --> 00:44:12
Oh, this leads into the next
chapter.

692
00:44:12 --> 00:44:18
Why can the vector one,
two, three not be a row and

693
00:44:18 --> 00:44:21
also in the null space?

694
00:44:21 --> 00:44:25
Fitting we close with this
question.

695
00:44:25 --> 00:44:30
Close is --
so V equal this one,

696
00:44:30 --> 00:44:38
two, three can't be in the null
space of a matrix and the row

697
00:44:38 --> 00:44:39
space.

698
00:44:39 --> 00:44:42
And my question is why not?

699
00:44:42 --> 00:44:43
Why not?

700
00:44:43 --> 00:44:51.71
So this is a question that we
can because it's sort of asked

701
00:44:51.71 --> 00:45:00
in a straightforward way,
we can figure out an answer.

702
00:45:00 --> 00:45:05
Well, actually yeah -- I'll
even pin it down,

703
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
it can't be in the null space
-- and be a row.

704
00:45:10 --> 00:45:14
I'll even pin it down further.

705
00:45:14 --> 00:45:17
Ask it to be a row of A.

706
00:45:17 --> 00:45:18
Why not?

707
00:45:18 --> 00:45:25
So I'm -- we know the
dimensions of these spaces.

708
00:45:25 --> 00:45:30
But now I'm asking you sort of
like the overlap between -- so

709
00:45:30 --> 00:45:36
the null space and the row
space, those are in the same

710
00:45:36 --> 00:45:38
n-dimensional space.

711
00:45:38 --> 00:45:42
Those are -- well,
those are both subspaces of

712
00:45:42 --> 00:45:47
n-dimensional space,
and I'm basically saying they

713
00:45:47 --> 00:45:50
can't overlap.

714
00:45:50 --> 00:45:54
I can't have a vector like
this, a typical vector,

715
00:45:54 --> 00:45:59
that's in the null space and
it's also a row of the matrix.

716
00:45:59 --> 00:46:00
Why is that?

717
00:46:00 --> 00:46:03
So that's a new sort of idea.

718
00:46:03 --> 00:46:07
Let's just see what it would
mean.

719
00:46:07 --> 00:46:11
I mean that A times this V,
why can this A times this V it

720
00:46:11 --> 00:46:13.04
can't be zero.

721
00:46:13.04 --> 00:46:17
Oh well, if it's zero,
so this is -- I'm getting it

722
00:46:17 --> 00:46:19
into the null space here.

723
00:46:19 --> 00:46:24
So this is -- now let's put
that vector's in the null space,

724
00:46:24 --> 00:46:27
why can't the first row of a
matrix be one,

725
00:46:27 --> 00:46:29
two, three?

726
00:46:29 --> 00:46:34
I can fill out the matrix as I
like.

727
00:46:34 --> 00:46:38
Why is that impossible?

728
00:46:38 --> 00:46:45.25
Well, you're seeing it's
impossible, right?

729
00:46:45.25 --> 00:46:49
That if that was a row of the
matrix and in the null space,

730
00:46:49 --> 00:46:53
that number would not be zero,
it would be fourteen.

731
00:46:53 --> 00:46:53
Right.

732
00:46:53 --> 00:46:58
So now we actually are
beginning to get a more complete

733
00:46:58 --> 00:47:00
picture of these four subspaces.

734
00:47:00 --> 00:47:03
The two that are over in
n-dimensional space,

735
00:47:03 --> 00:47:07
they actually only share the
zero vector.

736
00:47:07 --> 00:47:12
The intersection of the null
space and the row space is only

737
00:47:12 --> 00:47:14
the zero vector.

738
00:47:14 --> 00:47:19
And in fact the null space is
perpendicular to the row space.

739
00:47:19 --> 00:47:24
That'll be the first topic
let's see, we have a holiday

740
00:47:24 --> 00:47:28
Monday --
and I'll see you Wednesday with

741
00:47:28 --> 00:47:29.66
perpendiculars.

742
00:47:29.66 --> 00:47:31
And I'll see you Friday.

743
00:47:31 --> 00:47:34
So good luck on the quiz.
