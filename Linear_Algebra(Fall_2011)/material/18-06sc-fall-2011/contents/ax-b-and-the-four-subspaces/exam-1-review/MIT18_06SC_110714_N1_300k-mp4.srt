1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,570

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,000
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,460
So for the first part of this
course, we've learned

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,890
basically the ins and
outs of solving

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,140
linear systems of equations.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,800

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,470
Today we're going to
do a little review

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,760
of the basic concepts.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,520
Hopefully we'll see a few of
them in the following problem.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,260
We're given a square matrix A--
a three by three square

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,570
matrix A-- where the last
entry is a parameter k.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,200
And this parameter will vary.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,820
And we'll see what happens to
the system of equations--

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,540
Ax equal to 2 3 7, for which k
it has a unique solution, for

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,260
which k it has infinitely
many solutions.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,710
Then we'll find the
LU decomposition.

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,920
And finally, we'll write
down the complete

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,110
solution, the system.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,790
So I'll give you a few
minutes to work this

20
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,630
problem on your own.

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,710
And then please come back
and see how I do it.

22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,810

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,980
All right, welcome back.

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,510
So let's start with part A. For
which k does this system,

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,720
Ax equal 2, 3, 7 have
a unique solution?

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,690
So what do we know about square

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:46,310
systems of linear equations?

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,380
They have a unique solution
when the matrix A is

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,630
invertible.

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,230
So now when is A invertible?

31
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,590
It is invertible when
it is a full rank.

32
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,240
And how do we figure this out?

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,770
We do it by performing
row operations.

34
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,245
We do it by doing eliminations
on the matrix.

35
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:10,490

36
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,850
But since we want to simulate
in exam setting, It always

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,910
pays off to see what tasks
lie ahead of us.

38
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,000
So in part C, we're asked to
find the LU decomposition.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,200
This means that when we do row
operations, we'd better keep

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,020
track what row operations
we're doing exactly.

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,890
In particular, we'll
write them down

42
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,660
as elementary matrices.

43
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,280
And in part D, we'll
be asked to compute

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,070
the complete solution.

45
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:51,950
And therefore it's good to
do row operations on the

46
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,985
augmented matrix A.
So let's do this.

47
00:02:57,985 --> 00:03:00,330
I'm going to write this.

48
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:11,720
The augmented matrix A is the
following beast, 1, 1, 1, 1,

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:21,440
2, 3, 3, 4, k, and
then 2, 3, 7.

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,770
So first thing, we subtract
a multiple of row

52
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,400
one from row two.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,880
And it's exactly negative
1 times the first

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,360
row plus the second.

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,380
Let me write down the
corresponding elementary

56
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,340
matrix that does this.

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,300
It's E, 2, 1.

58
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,730
And it's lower diagonal with
1's on the diagonal.

59
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,700
And it's going to be exactly
minus 1 in the first entry of

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,950
the second row.

61
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,870

62
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:12,850
So we get 1, 1, 1,
2, 0, 1, 2, 1.

63
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,460

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,620
And we copy down
the third row.

65
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,810

66
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,660
Now we subtract a multiple
of the first row

67
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,550
from the third one.

68
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,790
And let me write this here.

69
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,890

70
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,040
Yeah, we'll multiply the first
row by negative 3, and add it

71
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
to the third one.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,490
This is accomplished by the
elementary matrix E, 3 1,

73
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,530
which is 1, 1, 1, negative
three, and then 0, 0.

74
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,320

75
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,030
OK, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1.

76
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,250
We copy the first two rows.

77
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:11,800
And then the third one will be
0, 1, k minus 3, and 7 minus 3

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,750
times 2, 7 minus 6, 1.

79
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,430

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,413
We have essentially one last
row operation to perform.

81
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:23,663
Let me do it here.

82
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:26,300

83
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,970
So we'll subtract the second
row from the third one.

84
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:46,170
And we'll get 1, 1, 1, 2,
0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, k

85
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:51,300
minus 5, and then 0.

86
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,150
And this was achieved by the
elementary matrix E, 3, 2,

87
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:05,780
which was 1, 1, 1, and
then negative 1.

88
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,160
Because we multiplied the second
row by negative 1 and

89
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,410
added it to the third one.

90
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:24,410
So we got two matrix, which
is upper triangular.

91
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,920
And we want to figure out for
which value of the parameter k

92
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,730
is this matrix a full rank.

93
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,310

94
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,320
This is a pivot.

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,440
This is a pivot.

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,200
And we want this one to
be a pivot as well.

97
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:51,410
And that happens when
k minus 5 is not 0.

98
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,000
So when k is different from 5,
the matrix A is a full rank.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,650
And therefore the system
Ax equals to 2, 3, 7

100
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,220
has a unique solution.

101
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:13,480
Now part B. For which
k do we have

102
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,960
infinitely many solutions?

103
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,160
So when are we in such
a situation?

104
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,540
We are in such a situation when
the null space of the

105
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,990
matrix A is nontrivial.

106
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:36,660
So the null space will be
nontrivial when this k minus 5

107
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,190
number here, which is what's
the pivot in the

108
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,760
first case, is 0.

109
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:50,030
So k minus 5 equals to 0.

110
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,260
You see there's a little
caveat here.

111
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,850
When k is equal to 5, we get the
third row of the augmented

112
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,760
matrix, 0, 0, 0, equal to 0.

113
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,900
This means that the matrix is
actually consistent, and we

114
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,500
indeed have a solution But if
this entry were non 0, then we

115
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,000
would get no solutions.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,240

117
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:24,850
Now off to part C. We want to
compute the LU decomposition.

118
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:33,090
Well, we already got what the
matrix U is through performing

119
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,470
row operations.

120
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,870
It's this guy here.

121
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,130
Let me write it down--

122
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:47,284
1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2,
0, 0, k minus 5.

123
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:52,370
And when k is equal to 4,
this entry's negative 1.

124
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,050

125
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,330
And now what about
the matrix L?

126
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,710
Well, how did we
get to this U?

127
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:08,640
We had the matrix A. We got the
matrix U. And what we did

128
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,670
was first we applied E, 2, 1.

129
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,840
Then we applied E, 3,
1 and then E, 3, 2.

130
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:24,500

131
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,170
We get A by inverting
this equation.

132
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:37,760
So it's going to be E, 2, 1
inverse E, 3, 1 inverse, E, 3,

133
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:48,660
2 inverse times U. And this is
our matrix L. And we know it's

134
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,480
fairly easy to invert these
elementary matrices E. We flip

135
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,755
the signs of the diagonal
entries.

136
00:09:56,755 --> 00:10:01,280

137
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,830
I'm not going to write
down again the

138
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,570
inverses of these guys.

139
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,500

140
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,780
I'm just going to write the
product of the inverses.

141
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,480
And that's also very
easy to compute.

142
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,380
Because one, we invert
the signs.

143
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:27,200
We just send the numbers and
their corresponding entry of

144
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,280
L. I mean the following thing.

145
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,390
So minus 1 becomes a 1.

146
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,945
And it comes here, it's
respective entry.

147
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:42,820

148
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:51,830
For E, 3, 1, we flip the
sign, first 3, and

149
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,350
we plug it in here.

150
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,175
And for E, 3, 2, we flip
the sign of this guy.

151
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,030
It comes 1, and we
plug it in here.

152
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,700

153
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,750
So give me a few moments to
erase the board, and then I'll

154
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,000
do part four.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,520

156
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,650
We're back, and we're going
to do part D now.

157
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,280
So we need to find the complete
solution of the

158
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,130
system for all k.

159
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,950
And we solved it for
k equal to 5.

160
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,650
The system had many,
many solutions.

161
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,280
And for k not equal to
5, it had only one.

162
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,680
So first let's look at the case
k not equal to 5 when the

163
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,225
matrix A was invertible.

164
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:46,840

165
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,780
It's not hard to see what
the solution of

166
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,830
the system then is.

167
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,960
It's going to be--let me
just write it down.

168
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,420

169
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,690
So when k is not equal
to 5, this was non 0.

170
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:11,520
Therefore, x3 needs to be 0.

171
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,370
When x3 is 0, we have
x2 plus 2 times x3.

172
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,250
So x2 plus 0 equals 1.

173
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,050
Therefore x2 is 1.

174
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,380
And then we go back
to the first row.

175
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,810
We have x1 plus x2
plus x3 equals 2.

176
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:38,880
So x1 plus 1 plus 0 equals 2.

177
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,810
So x1 plus 1 equals 2.

178
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,860
And therefore x1 is 1.

179
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,600
Good.

180
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,580
Now what about k
equalled to 5?

181
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:58,480
Then we see that x3 is
a free variable.

182
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,125
So the solution will
be x1, x2, x3.

183
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,650

184
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,800
x3 can be any number c.

185
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,420
From the second row, we'll
get the value of x2.

186
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,190
It's 1 minus 2 times x3.

187
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,430
So 1 minus 2 times c.

188
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:37,384
And x1 is 2 minus x2 minus x3.

189
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,480
So let me rewrite this.

190
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,960
It's 2 minus x2 is 1 minus--
aah, chalk--

191
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,051
2c minus c, 1 minus 2c, c.

192
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:56,760

193
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,860
So we'll decompose this vector
here into a component which is

194
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
independent of c and a
component which is

195
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,440
a multiple of c.

196
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,840
So this is 2 minus 1.

197
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:17,900
It should be 1, 1,
0 plus c times--

198
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,790

199
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,830
we'll have two c minus
c c, so c times 1.

200
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,692
Here we'll have minus
2c so negative 2.

201
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:33,290
And here we'll have 1.

202
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:38,770
And thus we get the particular
solution for the system and

203
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,160
the special solution
for the system.

204
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,420
We're kind of done here.

205
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,140
If you're at an exam, you should
immediately start the

206
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,100
next problem.

207
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,350
Good luck, and Ill
see you later.

208
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,530
