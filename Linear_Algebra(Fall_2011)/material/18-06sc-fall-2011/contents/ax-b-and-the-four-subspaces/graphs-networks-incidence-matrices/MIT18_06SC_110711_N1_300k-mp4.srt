NIKOLA KAMBUROV: Hi, guys.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,810
Today we're going to see how one
can use linear algebra to

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,620
describe graphs and networks.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,260
In particular, we'll do
the following problem.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,580
We're given this very simple
graph here with five

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,270
nodes and six edges.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,560
We've already labeled
them, and we've put

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,620
directions on the edges.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,180
And we are asked to write down
the incidence matrix, A, and

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,340
then to compute its kernel and
the kernel of A transpose.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,720
And finally, we're asked to
compute the trace of A

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,860
transpose A.

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,700
I'll give you a few moments to
try the problem on your own.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,550
And then you'll see
my take on it.

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:53,740

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,060
Hello again.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,520
OK, so let's first recall what
an incidence matrix is.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,740
So an incidence matrix is
supposed to encode how the

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,580
nodes connect to the edges.

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,710
In particular, it has as many
rows as there are edges and as

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,030
many columns as there
are nodes.

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,120
And we're going to
fill in the rows.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,270
And we'll fill them
out as follows.

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,340
So we're going to use only
negative 1, 1, and 0.

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:34,290
And we're going to put a
negative 1 in entry i and 1 in

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,800
entry j if the corresponding
edge connects

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,420
node i to node j.

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,440
OK, let me just do
it concretely.

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,160
So let's look at
edge number 1.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,850
So it corresponds to
the first row.

32
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,560
It connects 1 to 2.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,040
So we have a negative
1 and a 1.

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,610
Then edge number 2, it connects
node 2 to 3, so

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,910
negative 1, 1.

36
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:13,150
Edge number 3 connects node
1 to 3, so negative 1, 1.

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,350
And I believe you get
the picture, right?

38
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,104
So I'm just going to fill out
the rest of the entries.

39
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:22,361
All right, 4 is--

40
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:27,450
negative 1, to 1.

41
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,745
5 is--

42
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:31,260

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,980
well, 4, well, negative
1, 1 here.

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:45,240
And 6 is negative 1 and 1.

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,090
OK.

46
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,580
So we've constructed the matrix
A. Now, we'll compute

47
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,700
its null space.

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,750
And we're going to do it without
performing any row

49
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,260
operations whatsoever.

50
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,080
So in order to do this, it's
helpful to look at the graph

51
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,280
as an electric circuit and to
assign to each of the nodes an

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,310
electric potential.

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:21,220
If we collect all the electric
potentials in a vector x, then

54
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,380
A times x is a vector with as
many entries as there are

55
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:37,040
edges and gives precisely the
potential differences across

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,080
the edges of the graph.

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,180
OK, so then if Ax is to be 0,
this means that across the

58
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,520
graph, across all the edges of
the graph, all potential

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,740
differences are 0.

60
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:03,040
Therefore, all the potentials
at all the nodes need to be

61
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,000
equal to a constant number.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,149
So therefore, we conclude that
the null space of A is spanned

63
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:22,980
by constant 1.

64
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,260
OK?

65
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,760
There are five 1's here,

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,820
corresponding to the five nodes.

67
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,405
Now what about the null
space of A transpose?

68
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:36,120

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,250
Adopt this analogy with
electric circuits.

70
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,930
But this time, we're going to
look at currents flowing

71
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,705
across the edges of the graph.

72
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:49,830

73
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,470
Oh, and we are going to adopt
the following convention for

74
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,270
the currents.

75
00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:00,970
So a current is going to be
positive if it flows in the

76
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,140
direction of the edge and
negative if it flows in the

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,950
opposite direction.

78
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,620
Right.

79
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:21,920
So then what is A transpose y,
where y is a vector, each of

80
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,690
whose entries is a current
on the edge?

81
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:33,400
Well, the entries of A transpose
y are precisely

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,720
equal to the total current
flowing through each of the

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,270
nodes of the graph.

84
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,220
So A transpose y being equal
to 0 means that there is a

85
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,490
balance in the circuit, that the
currents that flow through

86
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,210
into each node equal the
currents that flow out of it.

87
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,190
Right.

88
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,690
And it's fairly easy to find
such a configuration of

89
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:08,340
currents that satisfies
this balance equation.

90
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,370
We do it by flowing around
loops of the graph.

91
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:19,830
So you see this graph
has three loops.

92
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:26,800
The first one is this
triangle up there.

93
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,720
The second one is this square.

94
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:37,630
And I'm just, by this curled
direction, I'm signifying in

95
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,050
which way I'm going
to trace the loop.

96
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,220
And there, the third loop
is along the outer

97
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,340
contour of the graph.

98
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,390
But in fact, the third one
can be thought of as a

99
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,770
superposition of these
two, and I'll

100
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,630
explain why in a second.

101
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:09,320
So let's figure out the
configuration of currents that

102
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,990
balances these loops.

103
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:20,280
So if we flow a current 1 from 1
to 2 and then flow a current

104
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,150
of 1 along edge 2, from 2 to 3,
and then we flow a current

105
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,430
of negative 1, mind that the
direction is opposite to the

106
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,680
direction of the loop, then
we're going to have a balanced

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,400
configuration of currents.

108
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,060
So let me write this down.

109
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:51,470
The following configuration,
so 1 along edge 1, 1 along

110
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:59,390
edge 2, and negative 1 along
edge 3, and the rest 0, is a

111
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,060
solution to A transpose y.

112
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,770

113
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:12,040
Let's see what solution we get
by flowing around the loop in

114
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,080
the square.

115
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:23,780
Well, we flow a current of 1
along edge 4, current of 1

116
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,000
along edge 5, current of 1 along
edge 6, and current of

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,980
negative 1 along edge 2.

118
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,929
So let's be careful.

119
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:40,496
So it was 0, then along
edge 2 was negative 1.

120
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:46,920
Along 3 is 0, along 4, 1,
along 5, 1, along 6, 1.

121
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,610

122
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:56,310
Now we can do the same thing
with the big loop and produce

123
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,330
a vector corresponding to it.

124
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,770
And I prompt you to do it.

125
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,320
But what you'll see is that
the vector that you get is

126
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,350
precisely a sum of these
two vectors.

127
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,880
In a way, the big loop
is a superposition

128
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,380
of the small loops.

129
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,740
OK, so we figured out what the
null space of A transpose is.

130
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,430
And now, let's concentrate our
attention on finding the trace

131
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:32,480
of A transpose A. We're going
to do it right here.

132
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,640
So the trace of a matrix
is the sum of

133
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,240
its diagonal entries.

134
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:48,390
And we've seen this many times
already, that the diagonal

135
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,290
entries of A transpose A are
precisely the magnitudes

136
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,090
squared of the columns
of A. OK?

137
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,350
So the 1, 1 entry is the
magnitude squared

138
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,490
of the first column.

139
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,950
The 2, 2 entry is the magnitude
squared of the

140
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,460
second column, and so on.

141
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,620
Now what is the magnitude
squared of a column of an

142
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,040
incidence matrix?

143
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:27,160
Well, each entry in a column
of an incidence matrix is

144
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,970
either 1, negative 1, or 0.

145
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,630
So when we square these entries,
we get 1's or 0's.

146
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,920
And when we add them up, we get
precisely a number which

147
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,430
is the nontrivial entries
in that column.

148
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,450
OK?

149
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,270
So the magnitude squared of the
column is the number of

150
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,970
nontrivial entries in it.

151
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,130
But if we go back to the matrix
A, and we count the

152
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:03,540
number of non-zero entries, this
is precisely the number

153
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,220
of edges that connect
with a node.

154
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,440
OK, so the number of edges that
connects with each node

155
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,580
is called the degree
of the node.

156
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:22,310
In this way, trace of A
transpose A will be just the

157
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:28,600
sum of the degrees of the
graph in the picture.

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:43,070
So we have there are 2 edges
connecting to 1, so 2, plus 3

159
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,940
edges connecting to 2, 3
edges connecting to 3.

160
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,040
And we've got a 2 for the number
of edges connecting to

161
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,040
4, and 2 for the number of
edges connecting to 5.

162
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:04,600
So altogether, we get 12.

163
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,800
So you see, in this problem,
we computed certain linear

164
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,110
algebra objects without
performing the usual algebraic

165
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,690
operations, but just by looking
at the graph and

166
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,520
seeing how the linear algebra
is encoded in it.

167
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,260
I hope it was most
illuminating.

168
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,510
I'll see you next time.

169
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,592
