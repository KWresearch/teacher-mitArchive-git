00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,466

00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,830
BEN HARRIS: Hi, and
welcome back.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,910
Today we're going to do a
problem about the four

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,160
fundamental subspaces.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,660
So here we have a matrix B. B is
written as the product to a

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,470
lower triangular matrix and an
upper triangular matrix.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,190
And we're going to find a basis
for, and compute the

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,280
dimension of, each of the four
fundamental subspaces of B.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,370
I'll give you a minute to try
that on your own, to hit

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,160
pause, and then I'll be right
back in just a minute and we

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,410
can do it together.

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:52,000

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,840
OK.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,580
We're back.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:02,830
Now, the first thing to notice
is that this is an LU

16
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:08,120
decomposition of B. So we
have L here and U here.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,350
Now let's go one space
at a time.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,870
Let's start with the
column space.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,190

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,450
And first, let's just say what
the dimension of the

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,490
column space is.

22
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,220
OK, so let's look
at our U matrix.

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,290
How many pivots do we have?

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,520
We have two pivots, so the
column space has dimension 2.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,250
This is the number of pivots.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,100
Good.

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,655
Now how do we find a basis
for the column space?

28
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:50,610

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,400
How do we find that basis?

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,020
Well, in lecture Professor
Strang had started with a

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,760
matrix B. He did elimination
on it, and then he took the

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,460
pivot columns in the
original matrix.

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,260
And that's great.

34
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,510
That works.

35
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,210
You can also take the pivot
columns in the L matrix.

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,230
You can see by multiplying this
out that it will amount

37
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,550
to essentially the same thing.

38
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,310
So a basis for this column
space, I can just take these

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:29,860
two pivot columns of my L
matrix, 1, 2, -1 and 0, 1, 0.

40
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,580
Good.

41
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,640
OK.

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,130
So there's the dimension of and
the basis for the column

43
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,070
space of B.

44
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,700
Next, let's do the null
space together.

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,230

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:46,380
OK.

47
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,570
What's the dimension
of the null space?

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,030

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:03:00,540
Well, the dimension of the
null space is always the

50
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,630
number of columns minus
the number of pivots.

51
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,880
Right?

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,260
It's the number of
free variables.

53
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,300
So here, that's just one.

54
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,640
Good.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,070
And how do we find this one
vector in the null space?

56
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:34,190

57
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:41,240
Well, what we do is we can just
plug in 1 for our free

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,770
variable, and we can back solve
to get the other two.

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:54,260
So this equation tells me that
my second number is -1, and

60
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,100
this equation tells me that that
third variable -3/5, if I

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,350
can fit it in here.

62
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,590

63
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,800
That's a -3/5, if it's
difficult to

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,890
see that on the tape.

65
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,300
Now let's move on.

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,600

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,380
Next is the row space.

68
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,170
So how do we find the dimension
of the row space?

69
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm going to write row space as

70
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,730
column space of B transpose.

71
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,070
How do we find that?

72
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,560
Well, remember that one of our
big facts in this class is

73
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,570
that the dimension of the row
space is the same as the

74
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,040
dimension of the column space.

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,060
It's just the number
of pivots.

76
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,030
So that's good.

77
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,660
It's 2.

78
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,600
And how do we find a basis
for the row space?

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,460
There are a couple ways of
thinking about this.

80
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,290
One way to think about it is we
got this upper triangular

81
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,110
matrix from B by doing
elimination.

82
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,420
And elimination doesn't
change the row space.

83
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,850
So I can just use the two pivot
rows of the matrix u.

84
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,700

85
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:27,000
Basis for my row space here is
I just put these two pivot

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:38,650
rows together, and I get a
basis for this row space.

87
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,230
The last one is always the
toughest and the trickiest. We

88
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,380
have to do the left
null space or the

89
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,910
null space of B transpose.

90
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,040

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,730
First, let's compute
its dimension.

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,100
What's the dimension of
this left null space?

93
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,510
Well, there's a similar formula
to the one we used

94
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,710
when we were computing the
dimension of the null space.

95
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,210
It's just the number of rows
minus the number of pivots.

96
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,930
So there are three rows.

97
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,900
Our matrix is 3 by 3.

98
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,370
And there're other two pivots.

99
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,330
So this is just one dimensional,
again.

100
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,810

101
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:29,180
We need to compute, now,
this left null space.

102
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,810

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,950
Let me go back to our
original matrix.

104
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:44,280
The way to do this is to take B
equals LU, and invert L, and

105
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,250
get EB equals U. So we need
to move L over to

106
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,500
the left-hand side.

107
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,670

108
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,910
If we do that--

109
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,390
I'm just going to write
that down here.

110
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,990

111
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,000
So what's the inverse
of the L matrix?

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:16,620
We just get 1, -2, 1, 0, 1, 1,
times B, is our U matrix, this

113
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,870
upper-triangular matrix.

114
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:25,830

115
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,300
Now that I moved L over to the
other side, I can read off the

116
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,400
vectors in my left null space.

117
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,850
Now, I'm looking at not my pivot
variables but my free

118
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,670
variables, because it's some
sort of null space.

119
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,940
but I want to look
at this E matrix.

120
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,040
So the third row of this
E matrix, the third row

121
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,920
corresponds to the three row
here and when I multiply this

122
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,450
by B, I just get zeros,
so this is in

123
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,765
the left null space.

124
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:03,570

125
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:11,190
A basis for this left
null space is--

126
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,330
see if I can fit it here--

127
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,830
just this 1, 0, 1.

128
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,080
Good.

129
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,530

130
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:30,610
So we've found the dimension
of and basis for all of the

131
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,559
four fundamental subspaces.

132
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,400
Before I move on, I just want
to recall which of the L

133
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,150
matrix or the U matrix we used
for each of these subspaces.

134
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:48,930
So for the column space,
we used the pivot

135
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,400
columns of the L matrix.

136
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,510
For the null space, we looked
at the U matrix.

137
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,080
For the row space we also
looked at the U matrix.

138
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,200
And for the left null space,
we needed to invert the L

139
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,000
matrix and look at
the three row.

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,730

141
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,230
We're done with the problem.

142
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,860
But the last thing that's useful
is to draw a picture,

143
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,790
which I have right here.

144
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,390
I know in lecture Professor
Strang has drawn you some sort

145
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,230
of cartoon pictures of what
these subspaces look like.

146
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,130
But here I want to try to
actually draw them in a

147
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,050
special case.

148
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:41,440
So if you can read my drawing
here, what do we have?

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:50,450
We have the row space here,
and the null space here.

150
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,064

151
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,470
Right?

152
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:02,640
And so B maps this picture
into this picture.

153
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,890
The null space here--

154
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,230
all the scalar multiples of
this vector-- all go to 0,

155
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,520
because they're in
the null space.

156
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,580
That's exactly what
B takes to 0.

157
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,770
B takes everything else,
including the row space, into

158
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,020
this column space.

159
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,270

160
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,490
And what is B transpose do?

161
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,110
Well B transpose kills this left
null space, kills this

162
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,820
vector, and it take everything
else into the row space, into

163
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,870
the column space
of B transpose.

164
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,910
OK.

165
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,870
Thanks for doing this
exercise together.

166
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,330
I hope this picture is helpful.

167
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,330
