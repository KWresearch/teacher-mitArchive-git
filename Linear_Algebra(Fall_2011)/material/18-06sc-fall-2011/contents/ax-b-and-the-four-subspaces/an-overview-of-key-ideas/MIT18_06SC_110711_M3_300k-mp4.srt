MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Welcome.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,840
Today's problem actually
appeared in a quiz.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,440
It appeared in quiz one in fall
of 1999 as question four.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,980
The problem puts the usual solve
the following system

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,850
upside down by saying we have
some matrix and we know that

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,500
all the solutions to ax equals
this vector here, 1, 4, 1, 1,

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,750
all the solutions to this
problem are given by x equals

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,820
0, 1, 1 plus any number
c times 1, 2, 1.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,250
And we're asked to say
everything that we can about

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,180
the columns of the matrix A.

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,270
So I'm going to let you pretend
that you are on an

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,900
exam, try to solve it yourself,
and then come back

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,150
and compare your solution
with mine.

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:57,210

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,610
OK, welcome back.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,220
So the first thing that you
should think about in this

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,140
sort of situation is what
is the size of a?

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,740
Well if we want to multiply a
with an x, that has three

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,734
entries, so a should
have three columns.

21
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:25,300
Let me call those columns
c1, c2, and c3.

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,810
And when I take some linear
combinations of c1, c2 and c3,

23
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,420
I'm going to get this vector
here, 1, 4, 1, 1.

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:43,380
So all the ci's, c1, c2, and
c3 are vectors in R4.

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,150

26
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,930
Now, if you know about, if you
learned about particular

27
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,820
solutions and special solutions,
then my notation

28
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,730
here shouldn't surprise you.

29
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,570
I'm going to call this
vector here xp, and

30
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,990
this vector here xs.

31
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:11,760
And I'm going to use the fact
that xp plus c times xs

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,970
satisfies A times
this equals b.

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,020
I will call this vector
b, for any number c.

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,580

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,610
In particular, what I'm going
to conclude is that when c

36
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:40,030
equals 0 we get a times
xp equals b.

37
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:48,280
But also that when c equals 1,
we get a times xp plus a times

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,750
xs equals b.

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:00,010
Replacing this by b, we get that
this implies that a times

40
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,820
Axs equals 0.

41
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,820
So in trying to find what are
the columns, c1, c2, and c3 of

42
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,770
the matrix A, let's look
at these two equations.

43
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,100
xp satisfies a times xp equals
b, and xs satisfies A

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,330
times xs equals 0.

45
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,440
Again, if you know what a
particular and special

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,610
solutions are this shouldn't
surprise you.

47
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,020
But we also know what xp and xs
are, so let's use them to

48
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,340
try to calculate
c1, c2, and c3.

49
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,630
A times xp equals b means that
the linear combination of c1,

50
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,990
c2, and c3 encoded in the vector
xp, which is 0, 1, 1,

51
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,730
gives the vector b.

52
00:03:46,730 --> 00:04:05,850
So c1, c2, c3 times 0, 1,
1 gives us 1, 4, 1, 1.

53
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,890

54
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:15,110
In other words, c2
plus c3 equal b.

55
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,649

56
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,959
Let's turn our attention
to A times xs equals 0.

57
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:32,890
This says that c1, c2, c3 times
xs was defined to be 0,

58
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,960
2, 1 equals 0.

59
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:47,550
In other words, 2 times
c2 plus c3 equals 0.

60
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,740
Now solving this system where
the unknowns are vectors but

61
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,200
it's still just a linear
system, we can see, for

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,060
example, from the second
equation that c3

63
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,350
equals minus 2c2.

64
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,240
And plugging it back into the
original equation getting c2

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,770
minus 2c2 equals b from which it
follows that c2 is equal to

66
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,280
minus b, and that c3 is
equal to 2 times b.

67
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,290

68
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,270
So from this tiny amount of
information, we just knew the

69
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,410
solutions to this one particular
equation involving

70
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,120
A, we got the second column of
A and the third column of A

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,540
completely explicitly
calculated.

72
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,980
Now, what can we say about
the first column?

73
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,760
I said before that all the
solutions of ax equals b are

74
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,540
of the form a particular
solution plus some number

75
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,660
times a special solution.

76
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,080
And the information that we have
is that there's just one

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,840
number here.

78
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,640
So we said everything, once we
remove this vector here,

79
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,270
everything that we get
here will satisfy A

80
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,380
times x equals 0.

81
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,280
And the fact that everything
that satisfies A times x

82
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,760
equals 0 is a multiple of this
one vector that was given to

83
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,390
us means that the null space
of A has dimension one.

84
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,000
There is just one special
solution.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,080
So dimension of the null
space of A is 1.

86
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,700

87
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:46,590
So rank of A is the number of
columns minus this dimension

88
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,850
of null space, and
it's equal to 2.

89
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,200
As rank of A is equal to 2,
the number of linearly

90
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,350
independent columns needs
to be 2 as well.

91
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,680
So the only thing that we can
say at this point is if the

92
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,720
first column was also a multiple
of b, as the second

93
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,990
and the third are, then the rank
would be smaller than 2.

94
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,240
So that is the only thing
that cannot happen.

95
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:22,400
So c1 is not a multiple of b.

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,000
Not any multiple, including
not a 0 multiple.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,160
And that's pretty much
everything we can say.

98
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,620
Yes, if it was some other
multiple of it, then we would

99
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,740
be able to find some other
vector here and we would have

100
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,760
two parameters.

101
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,340
But it's not, and this
is everything that we

102
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,590
can say about it.

103
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,040
