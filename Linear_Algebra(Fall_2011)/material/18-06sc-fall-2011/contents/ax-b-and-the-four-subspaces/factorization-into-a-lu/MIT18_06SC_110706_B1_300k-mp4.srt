00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,590
BEN HARRIS: Hi.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,220
I'm Ben.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,440
Today we are going to do an
LU decomposition problem.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,900
Here's the problem right here.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,330
Find that LU decomposition of
this matrix A. Now notice that

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,180
this matrix A has variables,
as well as numbers.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,820
So the sentence ends,
when it exists.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,720
And the second part of the
question asks you for which

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,610
real numbers a and b does the
LU decomposition of this

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,240
matrix actually exists?

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,650
Now, you can hit pause now and
I'll give you a few seconds.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,710
You can try to solve this on
your own, and then we'll be

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,245
back and we can do
it together.

15
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:58,320

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,740
And we're back.

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,480
Now, what do you have to
remember when doing an LU

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,760
decomposition problem?

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:16,200
Well we do elimination in the
same way that we did before in

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,020
order to find U. But with
this question we need

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,940
to find L as well.

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,890
So we need to do elimination,
but we also need to keep track

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,440
of the elimination matrices
along the way.

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,150
Good.

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,350
So let's do that.

26
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,780
So let me put my
matrix up here.

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:42,090

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,320
And we want to do elimination.

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,790
So which entry do we
eliminate first?

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,260
That's right.

31
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,320
It's this 2 1 entry.

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,660
So we replace the second row,
by the second row minus a

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,240
times the first row,
and we get this.

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:09,810

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,690
But we're not just doing
elimination, we're finding an

36
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,180
LU decomposition.

37
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,150
So we need to keep track of the
matrix that I multiplied

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,580
the elimination matrix, that I
multiplied this matrix A by on

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,980
the left to get this matrix.

40
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,800
So what is that?

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,950
That's this E21.

42
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,720
Since I eliminated the 21
entry, I'll call it E21.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,280
And it's this matrix.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,840
Why is it this matrix?

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Well remember how

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,000
multiplication on the left works.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,190
I replaced the first row
by just the first row.

48
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,310
I replaced the second row by the
second row minus a times

49
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,110
the first row.

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,700
So you can just read off
from these rows which

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,010
operations I did.

52
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,620
Now, which entries should
we eliminate next?

53
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,750
We need to eliminate this b.

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,830
So we will replace the third row
by the third row minus b

55
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,500
times the first row.

56
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:18,680

57
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,945
And which elimination
matrix did we use?

58
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:28,330

59
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,910
Well note, we replaced the third
row by the third row

60
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,950
minus b times the first row.

61
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,580
That's exactly what you
should read off

62
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,470
this elimination matrix.

63
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,400
Good.

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,220
Now, we only have
one step left.

65
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,550
We only need to eliminate
one last entry.

66
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,960
But this one's a little tricky,
so let's be careful.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,730
In order to eliminate this b,
we need a to be a pivot.

68
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,670
In particular, we need
a to be non-0.

69
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,330
If a were zero here,
then we would

70
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,610
have to do a row exchange.

71
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,220
And that's no good.

72
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,080
You can't find an LU
decomposition if you have to

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,100
do a row exchange
in elimination.

74
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,730
So we need to assume that
a is non-zero in

75
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,470
order to keep going.

76
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,070
So let's just assume there
that a is non-zero.

77
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,960
Now, what do we do?

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,180
Well we can replace the third
row by the third row minus b

79
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,040
over a times the second row.

80
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,600
And we just get this.

81
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,020
a minus b.

82
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,130
And let's write down our
elimination matrix.

83
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:59,340
E32 now.

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,910
There's our elimination
matrix.

85
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,530
We replaced the third row by the
third row minus b over a

86
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,520
times the second row.

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,770
Good.

88
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,630

89
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,130
So we found our U matrix.

90
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,000
That's what elimination does,
it gives us our U matrix.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,250
So let me write it up here.

92
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,300

93
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:28,050
1 0 1, 0 a 0, 0 0 a minus b.

94
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:35,130

95
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,140
Good.

96
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,790
Now we have to find our L
matrix, and we need to use

97
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,700
these elimination matrices
that we've been recording

98
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,440
along the way in order
to do that.

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,830
So remember that we started with
A, and we got U. And how

100
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,660
did we do that?

101
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,270
Well we multiplied on the left
by all of these elimination

102
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:05,770
matrices, E21, E31, and E32.

103
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,870
Sorry if that's scrunching
together there.

104
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,460
Now, if we move these
elimination matrices to the

105
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,220
other side then we'll get
L. So what do we have?

106
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:30,120
We have A equals E21 inverse,
E31 inverse, E32 inverse times

107
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,530
U. And this is our
L, this product

108
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,570
of these three matrices.

109
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,430
Good.

110
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,610
So let's compute it now.

111
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,190

112
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,170
So L is the product
of three matrices.

113
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,950
I need to get them by going
back and looking at these

114
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,110
three elimination matrices and
taking their inverses.

115
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,270
Well the nice thing about
taking an inverse of an

116
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,970
elementary matrix like this is
we just make a minus a plus or

117
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,150
a plus a minus.

118
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,470
So that's easy enough.

119
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,840
We just change the off-diagonal
entries, we just

120
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,090
change their signs.

121
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,860

122
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,232
You can check that that does
what we wanted it to.

123
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:20,450
It gives us the inverse.

124
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,720
Good.

125
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,410
And the last comment is that
multiplying these three

126
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,970
matrices is really easy
in this order.

127
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,460
Turns out all you do is
you just plop these

128
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,710
entries right in.

129
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,030

130
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,040
1 1.

131
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,860
Good.

132
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,110
So this is our L matrix.

133
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,780

134
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,410
So now we have our U matrix and
our L matrix, and we're

135
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,110
done with the first part
of the question.

136
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,850
The second part asks us for
which real numbers a and b

137
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,350
does this decomposition exist?

138
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,040
Now let's go back and remember
that at one point we had to

139
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,400
assume that A was non-zero.

140
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,380
That was the only assumption
we had to make to get this

141
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,030
decomposition.

142
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,630
So it exists, it being in this

143
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,825
decomposition, when a is non-zero.

144
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,880

145
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,500
And that's the answer
to the second part.

146
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,630

147
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,490
So we have our LU decomposition,
and we know

148
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,750
when it exists.

149
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,920
Before I end, two comments.

150
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,810
First, always check your work.

151
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,289
Always go back and multiply L
times U and make sure it's A,

152
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,820
because it's easy to screw up
the elimination process and

153
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,360
it's easy to check your work.

154
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,320
So if you go back and
make sure things are

155
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,300
as they should be.

156
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,940
Second comment is that you might
be worried when you do

157
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,250
this elimination process that,
well OK, we had to assume a is

158
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,410
non-zero because we wanted
a non-zero pivot.

159
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,910
You might worry that we
might have to have

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,290
a minus b be non-zero.

161
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,660
But in fact, a minus
b can be 0.

162
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:17,290
It's not a problem for this
entry to be 0 because we don't

163
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,180
have to do a row exchange to
get U. That's the only time

164
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,280
when we can't do the
LU decomposition.

165
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,290
In particular, singular
matrices can have LU

166
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,164
decompositions.

167
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:30,414
Good.

168
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:32,660

169
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,910
Thanks.

170
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,210
