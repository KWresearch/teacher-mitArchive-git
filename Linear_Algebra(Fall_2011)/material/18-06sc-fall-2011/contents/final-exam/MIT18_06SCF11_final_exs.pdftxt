(a)  Remembering  that  A  is  3  by  4,  ﬁnd  its  row  reduced  echelon  form  R. 

and 

(b)  Find  the  dimensions  of  all  four  fundamental  subspaces  C (A),  N (A), 

C (AT ),  N (AT ).


You  have  enough  information  to  ﬁnd  bases  for  one  or  more  of  these


subspaces—ﬁnd  those  bases.

Solution. 

(a)  Each  special  solution  tells  us  the  solution  to  Rx  = 0  when  we  set  one  free  variable  = 1 
and  the  others  = 0.  Here,  the  third  and fourth  variables  must be  the  two free  variables,

and  the  other  two  are  the  pivots:  R  =   0 1  ∗ ∗  

(The ∗’s  are just the  negatives  of  the  special  solutions’  pivot  entries.) 

(b)  We  know  the  nullspace  N (A) has  n  − r  = 4 − 2  = 2  dimensions:  the  special  solutions 

x1 , x2  form  a  basis. 

The  row  space  C (AT )  has  r  = 2  dimensions. 

It’s  orthogonal  to  N (A),  so  just  pick 

two  linearly-independent  vectors  orthogonal  to  x1  and  x2  to form  a  basis:  for  example,

(Or:  C (AT ) =  C (RT )  is  just  the  row  space  of  R,  so  the  ﬁrst  two  rows  are  a  basis. 

Same  thing!) 

The  column  space  C (A) has  r  = 2  dimensions (same  as  C (AT )).  We  can’t  write  down 

a  basis  because  we  don’t  know  what  A  is,  but  we  can  say  that  the  ﬁrst  two  columns  of 

A  are  a  basis. 

The  left  nullspace  N (AT )  has  m  − r  = 1  dimension;  it’s  orthogonal  to  C (A),  so  any 

vector  orthogonal  to  the  ﬁrst  two  columns  of  A  (whatever  they are)  will  be  a  basis.

nonzero entries  a, b, c, d, e, f .  You  could  use  cofactors  and  the formula 
for  the  inverse.  Or  possibly  Gauss-Jordan  elimination.

know  U  is  upper-triangular,  and  so  is  the  diagonal  matrix  Λ,  and  we’ve  just  shown 
that  U −1  is  upper-triangular  too.  So  their  product  A  is  also  upper-triangular. 

(c)  The  columns  aren’t  orthogonal!

(For  example,  the  product  u1 u2  of  the  ﬁrst  two 

columns  is  ab  + 0d  + 0  ·  0 =  ab,  which  is  nonzero  because  we’re  assuming  all  the 

entries  are  nonzero.)

(a)  A  and  B  are  any  matrices  with  the  same  number  of  rows. 

What  can you  say (and  explain  why  it  is  true ) about  the  comparison 

of 

i 
h 
rank  of  the  block  matrix  A B
(b)  Suppose  B  =  A2 . How do those ranks  compare ? Explain your reason­

rank  of  A 

ing. 

(c)  If  A  is  m  by  n  of  rank  r ,  what  are the dimensions  of  these  nullspaces ? 
h 
i 
Nullspace  of  A A

Nullspace  of  A 

Solution. 

(a)  All  you  can  say  is  that  rank  A  ≤  rank  [A B ].

(A  can  have  any  number  r  of  pivot 

columns,  and  these  will  all  be  pivot  columns  for  [A B ];  but  there  could  be  more  pivot 

columns  among  the  columns  of  B .) 

(b)  Now  rank  A  =  rank  [A A2 ].  (Every  column  of  A2  is  a  linear  combination  of  columns 
of  A.  For  instance,  if  we  call  A’s  ﬁrst  column  a1 ,  then  Aa1  is  the  ﬁrst  column  of  A2 . 
So  there  are  no  new  pivot  columns  in  the  A2  part  of  [A A2 ].) 

(c)  The  nullspace  N (A)  has  dimension  n  −  r ,  as  always.  Since  [A A]  only  has  r  pivot 

columns  —  the  n  columns  we  added  are  all  duplicates  —  [A A] is  an  m-by-2n  matrix 

of  rank  r ,  and  its  nullspace  N  ([A A]) has  dimension  2n  − r .

Suppose  A  is  a 5 by  3  matrix  and  Ax   is  never  zero (except  when  

x  is  the  zero  vector). 

(a)  What  can  you  say  about  the  columns  of  A ? 

(b)  Show  that  ATAx  is  also  never  zero (except  when  x  = 0) by  explaining 

this  key  step:


If  ATAx  = 0  then  obviously  xTATAx  = 0  and  then (WHY ?)  Ax  = 0.


(c)  We  now  know  that  ATA  is  invertible.  Explain  why  B  = (ATA)−1AT 

is  a  one-sided  inverse  of  A  (which  side  of  A ?).  B  is  NOT  a  2-sided 

inverse  of  A  (explain  why  not ). 

Solution. 

(a)  N (A) = 0  so  A  has  full  column  rank  r  =  n  = 3:  the  columns  are  linearly  independent. 

(b)  xTATAx  = (Ax)T Ax  is  the  squared  length  of  Ax.  The  only  way  it  can  be  zero  is  if 

Ax  has  zero length (meaning  Ax  = 0). 

(c)  B  is  a  left  inverse  of  A,  since  BA  = (ATA)−1ATA  =  I  is the (3-by-3)  identity  matrix. 

B  is  not  a  right  inverse  of  A,  because  AB  is  a  5-by-5  matrix  but  can  only  have  rank  3. 
(In  fact, BA  =  A(ATA)−1AT  is the pro jection  onto the (3-dimensional)  column  space 

of  A.)

If  A  is  3  by  3  symmetric  positive  deﬁnite,  then  Aqi  =  λiqi  with 

positive  eigenvalues  and  orthonormal   eigenvectors  qi . 

Suppose  x  =  c1q1  +  c2 q2  +  c3 q3 . 

(a)  Compute  xTx  and  also  xTAx  in  terms  of  the  c’s  and  λ’s. 

(b)  Looking  at  the  ratio  of  xTAx  in  part (a)  divided  by  xTx  in  part (a), 

what  c’s  would  make that  ratio  as large  as possible ?  You  can  assume 

λ1  < λ2  <  . . . < λn .  Conclusion:  the  ratio  xTAx/xTx  is  a  maximum 

when  x  is

3)  when  c1  =  c2  = 0,  so  x  =  c3 q3  is  a 

multiple  of  the  eigenvector  q3  with  the  largest  eigenvalue  λ3 . 

(Also  notice  that  the  maximum  value  of  this  “Rayleigh  quotient”  xTAx/xTx  is  the 

largest eigenvalue itself.  This is another way of ﬁnding  eigenvectors:  maximize  xTAx/xTx 

numerically.)

(a)  Find  a linear combination  w  of   the linearly independent  vec­

tors  v  and  u  that  is   perpendicular  to  u. 
(b)  For  the  2-column  matrix  A  =  h 
u v  i,  ﬁnd  Q  (orthonormal columns) 
and  R  (2  by 2  upper  triangular)  so  that  A  =  QR. 

(c)  In  terms  of  Q  only,  using  A  =  QR,  ﬁnd  the  pro jection  matrix  P  onto 

the  plane  spanned  by  u  and  v . 

Solution. 

(a)  You could just  write down  w  = 0u + 0v  = 0  — that’s perpendicular to everything!  But 

a  more  useful  choice is  to  subtract  oﬀ just  enough  u  so  that  w  =  v − cu  is perpendicular 

to  u.  That  means  0 =  wTu  =  vTu  − cuTu,  so  c  = (vTu)/(uTu) and 

w  =  v  − (

Tv u 
uTu 

)u. 

(b)  We  already  know  u  and  w  are  orthogonal; just  normalize them!  Take  q1  =  u/|u| and 
|u| 

q2  =  w/|w |.  Then  solve  for  the  columns  r1 ,  r2  of  R:  Qr1  =  u  so  r1  =  

0 
 

c|u|
Qr2  =  v  so  r2  =  

Then  Q = [q1  q2 ] and  R  = [r1  r2 ].

and  (C 2)−1 ? 

(c)  Find  the  determinants  of  C  and  C  +  I  and  C  + 2I . 

10


Solution. 

(a)  Take  the  determinant  of  C  − λI  (I expanded  by  cofactors):  λ4  − 1  = 0.  The  roots  of 

this  “characteristic  equation”  are  the  eigenvalues:  +1, −1, i, −i. 

The  eigenvalues  of  C 2  are just  λ2  =  ±1  (two  of each).


(Here’s  a  “guessing”  approach.  Since  C 4  =  I ,  all  the  eigenvalues  λ4  of  C 4  are  1:  so


λ  = 1, −1, i, −i  are the  only possibilities.  Just  check  to see  which  ones work.  Then the

eigenvalues  of  C 2  must  be  ±1.)


(b)  For  any  permutation  matrix,  C −1  =  C T :  so

1 0 0 0 

and  (C 2)−1  =  C 2  is  itself. 

(c)  The  determinant  of  C  is  the  product  of  its  eigenvalues:  1(−1)i(−i) =  −1. 

Add 1  to every  eigenvalue to get the eigenvalues  of  C + I  (if C  =  SΛS −1 ,  then  C + I  =


S (Λ + I )S −1):  2(0)(1 + i)(1 − i) =


0. 

(Or  let λ  =  −1  in  the  characteristic  equation  det(C  − λI ).)


Add  2  to  get  the  eigenvalues  of  C  + 2I  (or  let λ  =  −2):  3(1)(2 + i)(2 − i) = 15.

ATA  is  invertible: 

xˆ = (ATA)−1ATb 

and  p =  Axˆ is: 

Axˆ =  A(ATA)−1ATb 

(b)  p =  Axˆ is  a linear combination  of  columns  of  A,  so  it’s  in  the  column  space  C (A).  The
