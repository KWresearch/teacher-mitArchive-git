00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,570

00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,290
PROFESSOR: Hi.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,910
Welcome to the second special
recitation on

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,000
exam problem solving.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,570
As you may have experienced,
when you do homework problems,

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,360
you can give every problem
or even every

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,320
step a careful thought.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,800
You may even try different
methods in solving one

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,590
problem, just to check your
answers and also to find the

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,920
optimal way.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,400
But in the real exam, these may
not be available to you

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,590
anymore, because time
is the main issue.

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,300
So you want to do
things fast but

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,160
accurately at the same time.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,230
Today's recitation is going
to focus on that.

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,660
So we're going to look at
a real exam problem.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:54,500
So this is the problem from a
15-minute linear algebra exam.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
OK.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,780
By now, you've developed
enough background to

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,190
completely solve this problem.

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,040
So because this is a 15-minute
exam, a good suggestion on

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,660
time spending on this problem
would be no more than 15

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,530
minutes, which means within 15
minutes, you have to read

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,890
through the questions,
understand what they're asking

25
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,360
for, and completely solve
all three parts.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,620
Why don't you hit Pause now,
and try to complete this

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,280
problem as if you
were in an exam.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,070
And time yourself
for 15 minutes.

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,620
If you finish early, don't
forget to check your answer.

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,440
You want to get all
the credits you

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,330
deserve in an exam.

32
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,180
OK.

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,630
I'll come back later and
show you how I would

34
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,880
speed up in the exam.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:52,880

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,700
OK.

37
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,370
Have you finished?

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,320
Well, let's solve this
problem together.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,750
We are looking at a 4
by 4 matrix A here.

40
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,880
As you can see, this matrix is
made up by the examiner in a

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,100
rather casual way, because you
have numbers from 1 to 12 as

42
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,380
the entries of this matrix.

43
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,100
And in the first part, we want
to find all the non-0 terms in

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,050
this big formula to compute
determinant of A. So the

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,740
determinant of A--

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,225
so that's Part 1--

47
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:32,170

48
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,690
that's equal to a big summation
of plus or minus A1

49
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:45,720
alpha, A2 beta, A3 gamma
and A4 delta.

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,790
So what I'm doing here is I
choose one entry from each row

51
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,830
with the columns being
all different.

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,665
So in other words, if I take
this column numbers down-- let

53
00:02:57,665 --> 00:02:59,420
me write it here--

54
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,500
alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,060
I want this to be
a permutation of

56
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,920
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.

57
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
OK.

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,530
So how would you do it?

59
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,110
Well, if you follow this order,
you may want to start

60
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,570
with the first row.

61
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,000
And you go through all the
possibilities of this alpha,

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,320
beta, gamma, and delta, and at
the end, you drop the terms

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,860
which are 0.

64
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,660
But if you do it in that
way, how many terms

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,770
do you have to compute?

66
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,130
This is a 4 by 4 matrix.

67
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:40,070
So in general, this sum will
contain 4 factorial, which is

68
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,750
24 terms.

69
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,860
That sounds time consuming.

70
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,740
So can you do it in
a faster way?

71
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,790
Well, since we only care about
non-0 terms in this sum, let's

72
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,110
look at where 0 occurs in
matrix A. They're here.

73
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,120
You have 0 entries in
these four spots.

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,750
OK.

75
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,320
So they all occur in the third
row and the fourth row, which

76
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,950
means when you make your
choice of the last two

77
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:16,230
entries, in order not to get 0,
you can only choose within

78
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,820
this red box.

79
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,079

80
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,750
Because you want to
avoid these 0s.

81
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,440
Which means the choice of the
last two entries can only be

82
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,430
either 9, 12 or 10, 11.

83
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,240
OK.

84
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,480
Now, if that's the case, what
would happened to the first

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,110
two entries?

86
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,440
Since they all have to come from
different columns, which

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,810
means when you choose the first
two entries, they can

88
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,690
only be from this red box.

89
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,260

90
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,560
Which means the choice of the
first two entries can only be

91
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,140
either 1, 6 or 2, 5.

92
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,810
So how many terms am
I talking about?

93
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,100
Two possibilities here and two
possibilities here, which

94
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,360
comes to four.

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,130
So in other words, instead of
computing 24 terms, you only

96
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,520
need four terms here.

97
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,060
Let's put them down.

98
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,670
OK.

99
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,530
So we start with this
choice 1, 6, 9, 12.

100
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:37,330
So that's 1 times 6
times 9 times 12.

101
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,380
Well, these are from
diagonal, right?

102
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,350
So of course, this coordinate
numbers would just be A11,

103
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,700
A22, A33, A44.

104
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,870
This is the perfect alignment
of 1 2, 3, 4, so the sign of

105
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,420
this term is just a plus sign.

106
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,680
Let's continue.

107
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,900
Now I'm going to look
at 1, 6 but 10, 11.

108
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:11,590
So 1 times 6 times
10 times 11.

109
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,440
What is the coordinate
number--

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,480
what are the coordinate numbers
of this choice?

111
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,170
A11, A22, 10 comes from A34.

112
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,110
So here I have 4 in the front.

113
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,470
The last one is A43,
so right here.

114
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,040
This is the permutation
of 1, 2, 3, 4.

115
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,130
In order to get back to this,
I have to exchange 3 and 4.

116
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,600
Just do it once.

117
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,360
OK.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,400
Which means I need a negative
sign in front.

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,130

120
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,625
A negative sign in front
of the entire product.

121
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,875
Well, let's continue.

122
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,150

123
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,540
I'm going to write
it down here.

124
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,740
As you can see the blue
part indicate the

125
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,910
signature of columns.

126
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,300
So next term, I'm
going to put--

127
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,430
I've exhausted the first
possibility of

128
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,100
choosing 1, 6, right?

129
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,840
So let's look at 2, 5.

130
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:20,680
2 times 5 times 9 times 12.

131
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,140
What is the column?

132
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,340
What are the column numbers?

133
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,740
2 comes from 1, 2 entry, so
I have a 2 in the front.

134
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,200
5 is 2, 1 entry, so 2,
1, and then 3, 4.

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,090
3, 4.

136
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:43,460
Again, I need one exchange to
get back to 1, 2, 3, 4, which

137
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,200
means I have a negative
sign in the front.

138
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,070
The last one would be 2, 5.

139
00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:01,050
2 times 5 times 10, 11,
so times 10 times 11.

140
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:09,900
Columns are A12,
A21, A34, A43.

141
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,270
So you exchange the first two
spots, and the last two spots.

142
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,250
You get back to 1, 2, 3, 4.

143
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,660
But you have to do twice, two
exchanges, which means you

144
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,810
need a plus sign in front.

145
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,000
That's it.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,660
This big summation formula comes
down to the sum of four

147
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,940
terms. And you can compute it.

148
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,940
If you don't make any
algebra mistake, the

149
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,929
result should be 8.

150
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,950

151
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,940
Did you get the right answer?

152
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,669
All right, time is
really precious.

153
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,780
Let's move on to the
second part.

154
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,890
In the second part, we need
to find cofactor C11,

155
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,950
C12, C1,3 and C14.

156
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,330
Let me put the second
part here.

157
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,590

158
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,920
So we're looking for the
cofactors of the first row of

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,470
matrix A. Let's just write
everything down.

160
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,640
C11.

161
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,140
C11 is the cofactor of
this entry here.

162
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,370
So you're looking at the
determinant of this left over

163
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,280
3 by 3 matrix.

164
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,140
So that's the determinant of--

165
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,020
copy it down--

166
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:37,070
6, 7, 8, 0, 9, 10, 0, 11, 12.

167
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,880
How would you compute this?

168
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,490
This is a 3 by 3 matrix.

169
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,400
Of course, you can use the big
summation formula again.

170
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,900
In other words, you can write
down this determinant--

171
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,850
this formula, but for the
specific 3 by 3 matrix.

172
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,550
But that will involve three
factorial terms, right?

173
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,110
Which is

174
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,550
six terms. All right.

175
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,200
Is there a way that you
can do it faster?

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,830
Just notice that the first
column of this matrix has only

177
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,180
one non-0 entry, which
is this 1,1 entry 6.

178
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,570
So why do we just expand
this along the first

179
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,340
column and use cofactors?

180
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
Let's do it.

181
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,080
This determinant is equal
to 6 times its cofactor.

182
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,630
And its cofactor comes to the
determinant of this 2 by 2

183
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,110
matrix, which is easy.

184
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:40,360
That becomes 9 times 12
minus 10 times 11.

185
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,710
And if you compute this
correctly, that should be -12.

186
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,960
That's not too bad.

187
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,280
Let's look at the
second one, C12.

188
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,220
C12 is the determinant of
this 3 by 3 matrix.

189
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,000
So I have to delete the first
row and the second column.

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,100
And I raid what is left over
and I put it here.

191
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:19,940
So that's 5, 7, 8, 0,
9, 10, 0, 11, 12.

192
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,020
Same thing.

193
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,490
The first column has only
one non-0 entry.

194
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,890
You expand it along the first
column, use cofactors, the

195
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,080
result will be 10.

196
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,450
There's one thing that
I've forgotten here.

197
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,360
Because we are looking
at 1,2 entry.

198
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,550
So for the cofactor, I
have to put an extra

199
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,770
negative sign here.

200
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,970
So this is actually -1
times the determinant

201
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,210
of this 3 by 3 matrix.

202
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,770
And the result will be 10.

203
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,400
OK, let's continue.

204
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,140
C13.

205
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,900
Let's hope the computation
is going to

206
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,460
get easier and easier.

207
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,820
So C13 is the determinant of
the leftover 3 by 3 matrix.

208
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,350
So I'll directly
raid from that.

209
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:20,740
That's going to be 5, 6, 8,
0, 0, 10, and 0, 0, 12.

210
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,080
What is the determinant
of this matrix?

211
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,610
Again, you can use the same
method as we did for the first

212
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,610
two, because the first column
has only one non-0 entry.

213
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,450
And if you do that, the
result should be 0.

214
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,570
But you should be able to tell
it without any direct

215
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,990
computation.

216
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,570
Why is that?

217
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,790
Well, clearly the first two
columns are linearly

218
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:53,630
dependent, because the second
column is 6 over 5 times the

219
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,720
first column.

220
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,820
So this is a singular matrix.

221
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,150
Right away, the determinant
is 0.

222
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,870
So what is C14?

223
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,750
C14 is the determinant of
the matrix of 5, 6, 7,

224
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:16,550
0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 11.

225
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,310
Same thing.

226
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,150
It's singular, so its
determinant is 0.

227
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,870
All right.

228
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,050
So that completes
the second part.

229
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,810
You can move on to the third
part now, but before you do

230
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,360
that, just notice this may be
a good point to check your

231
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,910
answer from the first part.

232
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,130
Because you have all the
cofactors of the first row of

233
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,830
A, and if you use the other
formula to compute the

234
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:50,620
determinant of A, you can see
the determinant of A is equal

235
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,000
to the dot product of the first
row with its cofactors.

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,270
So because the last two
cofactors is 0, so I only have

237
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,080
two terms in the sum.

238
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,790
So determinant A is equal to
A11 entry, which is 1 times

239
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:21,960
C11 which is -12 plus A12 entry
which is 2 times C12

240
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,880
which is 10.

241
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,510
What is that?

242
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,300
-12 plus 20, that give you 8.

243
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,440
OK, at least the answers from
the first two parts are

244
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,750
consistent.

245
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,720
So by now, you should be more
confident to move on to the

246
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,560
third part.

247
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,330
I have a problem of space.

248
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,510
So please allow me to put
the third part here.

249
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,030
I'm going to come all
the way back here.

250
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,970
So that's my third part.

251
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,570
What is the third part?

252
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,130
Third part asks you to find the
first column of A inverse.

253
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,300
Well, it seems that involves
more computation of cofactors,

254
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,600
but as many well designed exam
problems, the answer from

255
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,720
third part can be directly
derived from the first part

256
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,030
and the second part.

257
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,800
That's how you should do it.

258
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,050
So what is A inverse?

259
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:31,760
The formula for A inverse is
equal to 1 over determinant of

260
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:40,260
A times the transpose of a
matrix C. This matrix C is

261
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,350
composed by cofactors of matrix
A. We want to find the

262
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,840
first column of A inverse.

263
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:59,690
So the first column of A inverse
should be one of our

264
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,880
determinants of A, this
constant, times the first row

265
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,280
of C but transpose, right?

266
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:15,030
So I have to put here, first
row of C but transpose.

267
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,700

268
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,240
Determinant of A comes from the
first part and the first

269
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,700
row of C comes from
the second part.

270
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,480
So I just copy what I have from
the first two parts down.

271
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,750
That's 1 over 8.

272
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:41,540
This column vector will
become -12, 10, 0, 0.

273
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,930
That's it.

274
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,370
That completes this problem.

275
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,770
Have you got your
answer right?

276
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,590

277
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,430
OK, before I finish, there are
two things that I like to

278
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,730
remind you.

279
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,860
First, as you can see, this
is an exercise on the big

280
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,339
summation formula to compute
determinant of A. In previous

281
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,420
recitation, we practice using
the combination of elimination

282
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,730
and the method by cofactors
to compute determinants.

283
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,000
But we should never forget
this formula.

284
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,819
Because it always works.

285
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,450
And in a lot of cases, this will
turn out to be an easy

286
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,480
way to compute determinant.

287
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,260
For example, for this
matrix A here.

288
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,580
And second in your real exam, it
would be really helpful if

289
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,070
you can put down your work like
this, because it helps

290
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,900
you to check your work.

291
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,990
And also, even if you don't get
your final answer correct,

292
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,130
this may get you some
partial credits.

293
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,960
OK, I'm going to stop here, and
thank you for watching.

294
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,680
