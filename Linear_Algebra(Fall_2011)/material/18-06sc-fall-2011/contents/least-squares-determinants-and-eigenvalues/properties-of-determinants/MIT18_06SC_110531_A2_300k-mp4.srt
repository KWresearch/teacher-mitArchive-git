00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,530
ANA RITA PIRES: Hi.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,250
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,340
In lecture, you've been learning
about the properties

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,600
of determinants.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,300
To remember, there were three
main properties, and then

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,680
seven more that fall
out of those three.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,580
I'll tell you what
these three were.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,350
The first one was the
determinant of the identity

10
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,850
matrix is always equal to 1.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,680
If you switch two rows in a
matrix, the determinant

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,630
switches sign, and the
determinant is

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,720
a function of each--

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,630
it's a linear function of
each row separately.

15
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,780
And there's seven more.

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,430
We'll use them here.

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,940
Today's problem is about finding
the determinants of

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,380
matrices by using these
properties.

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,640
So here you have
four matrices.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,600
A has lots of 100s, 200s,
and 300s numbers.

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,180
B is called a Vandermonde
matrix.

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,660
It has a very nice structure
with 1s, and then abc, a

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,130
squared, b squared, c squared.

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,490
It can be bigger, and you'll
just have cubes and more

25
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,750
letters down here.

26
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,380
C is given by the product
of these two,

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,510
and D is this matrix.

28
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,050
Good luck.

29
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,910
Hit pause, work on them, and
when you're ready, come back

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,160
and I'll show you
how I did it.

31
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:25,290

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,440
Did you get some?

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,910
OK, let's do it.

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:36,770
Starting with matrix A. I have
lots of big numbers.

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,400

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,410
I suggest that we do a little
bit of elimination, because as

37
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,090
you know, doing elimination
steps, except for permuting

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,100
rows, doesn't change the
determinant in the matrix.

39
00:01:52,100 --> 00:02:00,990
So let's do determinant
of A is equal to 101.

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,124
201.

41
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:04,660
301.

42
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,580
Then if I subtract off the first
row from the second one,

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll get 1, 1, 1, which
is very convenient.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,160
And actually, if you subtract
the second row from the third

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,480
one, you'll get 1, 1, 1.

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,690
Here's the property of
the determinant.

47
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,670
If you have two equal rows on
your matrix, the determinant

48
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,105
is automatically
equal to zero.

49
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:30,750

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,310
All right.

51
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,420
All done with one of them.

52
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,660
Let's work on the second one.

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,940
The determinant of B. Well let's
try elimination again.

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,310
1, a, a squared.

55
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,700
1 minus 1 is 0, b minus a, and
b squared minus a squared.

56
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,610
b squared minus a squared--
let me factor that into b

57
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,420
minus a, b plus a, which
will be very

58
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,440
convenient in the next step.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,290
And then I'm going to subtract
the first row again

60
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,935
from the third one.

61
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,430
I'll get 0, c minus a.

62
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,550
And again, I'll get c squared
minus a squared, c

63
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,742
minus a, c plus a.

64
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:23,350

65
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:30,890
Let's use that third property
that was the determinant is

66
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,270
linear on each row separately.

67
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,320
So what I'm going to do is, see
this factor of b minus a?

68
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,170
It shows up in every
entry of this row.

69
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,900
Well it's a 0, so it's the
0 multiple of b minus a.

70
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,110
So I'm going to pull out this
factor of b minus a, and this

71
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,710
row is going to become
0, 1, b plus a.

72
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,100
I will also, in the same
step, do the same thing

73
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,230
with the third row.

74
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,710
I'll pull out a factor of c
minus a, and it will become 0,

75
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,260
1, c plus a.

76
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,540
Here's one factor from
the second row.

77
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,640
Another factor from
the third row.

78
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,420
And 1, a, a squared.

79
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,200
0, 1, b plus a.

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,410
0, 1, c plus a.

81
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,460

82
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,760
Now what?

83
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,490
Well remember, you know how to
do the determinant of upper

84
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,750
triangular matrices because all
that you do is multiply

85
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,760
the pivots.

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,380
This is almost upper
triangular, except

87
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,610
there's a 1 over here.

88
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,410
So let's do another
elimination step.

89
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,250

90
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:52,790
b minus a, c minus a,
1, a, a squared.

91
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,200
0, 1, b plus a.

92
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:06,400
0, 0, c plus a minus b
plus a is c minus b.

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,280
So the determinant of this
matrix is now 1 times 1

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,390
times c minus b.

95
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:21,050
So we get b minus a, c minus
a, c minus b, which has a

96
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,120
really nice formula.

97
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,540
This is called the Vandermonde
determinant.

98
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,430
It's always like this, even if
your matrix is bigger than 3

99
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,770
by 3, if it's 4 by 4, or 5 by
5 and so on, you just have

100
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,910
more differences of all
the letters that

101
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,870
show up in your matrix.

102
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,190
On to matrix number 3.

103
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,530
C equals 1, 2, 3.

104
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,450

105
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,990
1, -4, 5.

106
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,010
How did you get the determinant
for this one?

107
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,620
Well remember, this is a rank
one matrix because it's a

108
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,900
column vector times
a row vector.

109
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,350
So if you write out what the
matrix is it'll be a 3 by 3

110
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,140
matrix where we can think
about it this way.

111
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,210
The first row will be
1 times 1, -4, 5.

112
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,260
The second row will be 2
times those numbers.

113
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,870
And the third row will be three
times those numbers.

114
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:31,370
So all the rows are going to
be linearly dependent, or

115
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,492
another way of saying the
matrix is singular.

116
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,950
When the matrix is singular,
the determinant is always

117
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,750
equal to 0.

118
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,580
That's also one of
the properties.

119
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,490
C is 0.

120
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,930

121
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,240
Onto the next matrix.

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,690
Last one.

123
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:56,660
D is equal to 0, 0, 0.

124
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:06,750
1, -1, 3, -3, 4, -4.

125
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,870
Maybe you didn't get that from
just looking at the matrix the

126
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,105
first time, but did you see
how I wrote it down?

127
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:15,180
It has 0's down the diagonal.

128
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,130
And then for each entry, I
have minus that entry.

129
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,660
That means that this matrix
is skew symmetric.

130
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,630
What that means is if you do
D transpose, it will not be

131
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:33,250
equal to D, but it will be equal
to minus D. D transpose

132
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,430
is equal to minus D.

133
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,890
Now, what does this give
us for a determinant?

134
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,860
Well if these two matrices
are the same matrix, this

135
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,830
determinant is equal to
that determinant.

136
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,390
One of the properties is that
the determinant of a transpose

137
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,870
of the matrix is equal
to the determinant of

138
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,100
the original matrix.

139
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,460
How about this side?

140
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:07,350
Well first temptation would
be to just write that.

141
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,330
Is that always true?

142
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:09,870
No.

143
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,120
The determinant is linear
on each row separately.

144
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,790
That means that you can't pull
out the factor that is

145
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,010
multiplying the matrix.

146
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,330
You have to pull it out once
for each row of the matrix.

147
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:32,380
So what I should have
written was -1,

148
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,179
that's my factor minus.

149
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,370
How many rows do I have?

150
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,490
One, two, three.

151
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,720
Pull it out once for each row
times the determinant of D.

152
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,370
Well fortunately, -1 to the
third is simply equal to -1.

153
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,860
So here we go.

154
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,490
It was correct, in fact.

155
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,330
We have determinant of D is
equal to minus determinant of

156
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,880
D. What is the only number
that is equal

157
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,970
to minus that number?

158
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,580
0.

159
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,991
Determinant of D is
equal to 0 again.

160
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,830
Let me ask you one
last question.

161
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,520
Is it true that all skew
symmetric matrices have the

162
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,355
determinant equal to 0?

163
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,190
It was true for this one.

164
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,010
Is it true in every case?

165
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,860
Well the key factor here was
that I had -1 to the third

166
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,330
power and I got a minus sign
here, determinant of D is

167
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,215
equal to minus determinant
of D.

168
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:34,920
What if this number had
been an even number?

169
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,370
Then I would just have the
determinant of D is equal

170
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,350
minus 1 to an even number,
D. That's 1.

171
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,840
So I would have determinant of
D is equal to determinant of

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,380
D. There's nothing I can
say about that number.

173
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,505
It can be your favorite number,
not necessarily 0.

174
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:52,510
