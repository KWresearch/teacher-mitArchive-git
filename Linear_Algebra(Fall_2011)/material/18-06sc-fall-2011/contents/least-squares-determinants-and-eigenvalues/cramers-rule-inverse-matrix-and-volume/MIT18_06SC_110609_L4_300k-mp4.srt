00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,780
LINAN CHEN: Hello.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,870
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,030
I'm sure you are becoming more
and more familiar with the

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,220
determinants of matrices.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,940
In the lecture, we also
learned the geometric

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,780
interpretation of
the determinant.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,820
The absolute value of the
determinant of a matrix is

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,120
simply equal to the volume of
the parallelepiped spanned by

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,040
the row vectors of
that matrix.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,290
So today, we're going to apply
this fact to solve the

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,420
following problem.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,990
I have a tetrahedron,
T, in this 3D space.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,150
And the vertices of T are
given by O, which is the

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:54,040
origin, A1, A2, and A3.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,940
So I have highlighted
this tetrahedron

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,190
using the blue chalk.

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,270
So this is T.

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,990
And our first goal is to compute
the volume of T using

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,330
the determinant.

21
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:17,740
And the second part is if I fix
A1 and A2, but move A3 to

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,830
another point, A3 prime, which
is given by this coordinate, I

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,370
ask you to compute
the volume again.

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,130
OK.

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,610
So since we want to use the fact
that the determinant is

26
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,370
related to the volume, we have
to figure out which volume we

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,680
should be looking at.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,760
We know that the determinant is
related to the volume of a

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,060
parallelepiped.

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,220
But here, we only have
a tetrahedron.

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,010
So the first goal should be to
find out which parallelepiped

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,230
you should be working with.

33
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,910
OK, why don't you hit
pause and try

34
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,810
to work it out yourself.

35
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,080
You can sketch the

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,510
parallelepiped on this picture.

37
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,780
And I will return in a while and
continue working with you.

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:12,960

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,640
All right.

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,990
How did your computation go?

41
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,520
Now let's complete this
picture together.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,640
As we were saying, we need a
parallelepiped so that we can

43
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,800
use the fact that the
determinant is

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,790
related to the volume.

45
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,700
Here, I have a tetrahedron.

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:39,230
And let's look at these three
edges, OA1, OA2, and OA3.

47
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,640
All of them meet
at the origin.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,870
So why don't we just consider
the parallelepiped spanned by

49
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,430
those same three edges?

50
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,010
It's a natural choice because at
least it shares three edges

51
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,116
with T.

52
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:58,500
OK, now let's move on to
this picture here.

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,740
As you can see, I
have drawn this

54
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,180
parallelepiped in red chalk.

55
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,080
So the blue part is
my original T.

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,890
And the red part, let me call it
P. It's the parallelepiped

57
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,830
spanned by edges OA1,
OA2, and OA3.

58
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,870
So that's the parallelepiped
that I'm going to work with.

59
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,960
Now the next step is to relate
the volume of T to the volume

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,100
of P. OK, let's recall together
what is the volume of

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,820
a tetrahedron.

62
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:45,960
We note that the volume of a
tetrahedron is going to be

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,470
equal to 1/3 of the
area of the base

64
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,260
times the height, right?

65
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,800
Of course, you can choose any
side, any face to be the base.

66
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,300
But for convenience, we're going
to choose the triangle

67
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,290
OA1A2 to be the base of T. So
the volume of T is going to be

68
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,310
equal to 1/3 times the area
of triangle OA1A2.

69
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,950

70
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,540
So I use this A to indicate
the area.

71
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,430
Then times the height.

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,470
Well, if I choose this to
be my base, then this

73
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,560
A3 becomes the apex.

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,820
Then the height is simply equal
to the distance from A3

75
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,000
to the triangle OA1A2.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,220
Let me use letter h to
denote this quantity.

77
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,910
So that's the height.

78
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,210
And the volume of T is equal to
1/3 of the product of the

79
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,390
area of the base times
the height.

80
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,890
OK, this is the volume of
T. Now let's see what

81
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,250
the volume of P is.

82
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,790
So P is a parallelepiped.

83
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,780
The volume of a parallelepiped
is simply equal to the area of

84
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,800
the base times its height.

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,020
This time, which face would
you choose to be the base?

86
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,140
Well, of course, you would
like to choose this

87
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,450
parallelogram to be the base
because it contains the base

88
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,200
of T.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,700
If we do so, so we want to
choose this parallelogram to

90
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,920
be the base, then what
is the area of this?

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,590
Well, it clearly contains two
copies of the triangle OA1A2.

92
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,460

93
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,940
So the area of the parallelogram
is simply equal

94
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,115
to twice the area of
the triangle OA1A2.

95
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:56,410

96
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,600
Then what is the height of P?

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,950
Again, if you choose this face
to be the base, then A3

98
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,360
becomes the apex again.

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,430
Then the height of the
parallelepiped is equal to the

100
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,980
distance from A3 to the base,
which is the same as the

101
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,930
distance from A3 to
triangle OA1A2.

102
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,050
So here, the height is
also equal to h.

103
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,390

104
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,860
Now you can compare these
two formulae.

105
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:40,700
You see that volume of T is
simply equal to 1/6 of volume

106
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:47,330
of P. That's the connection
between the volume of the

107
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,170
tetrahedron with the volume
of the parallelepiped.

108
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,410
In order to compute the volume
of T, we only need to compute

109
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,530
the volume of P.

110
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,380
Now let's compute the volume
of this parallelepiped.

111
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,370

112
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:10,280
We know that it's related to the
determinant of a matrix.

113
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,660
And the row vectors of that
matrix are given by these

114
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,850
three edges.

115
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,730
So because all of them start
from 0, we only need the

116
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,090
coordinate of A1, A2, and A3.

117
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,730
So here, volume of P is equal
to the absolute value.

118
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,320
So don't forget the absolute
value sign.

119
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,790
Absolute value of the
determinant of a three by

120
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,180
three matrix.

121
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,260
So we just need to copy
the coordinates of the

122
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,340
vertices down here.

123
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,280
The first one is 2, 2, -1.

124
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,530
These two are too close.

125
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,100

126
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,240
-1.

127
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,084
And A2 is 1, 3, 0.

128
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:07,070
A3 is -1, 1, 4.

129
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,440
The absolute value of
this determinant.

130
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,290
And if you compute this, this
is a three by three matrix.

131
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,010
The determinant should
be easy to compute.

132
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:25,900
And the result should be 12.

133
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,770
So that's the volume of P, which
means the volume of the

134
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:38,659
tetrahedron, T, is equal
to 12/6, which is 2.

135
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,240
Did you get the correct
answer?

136
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,780
OK, so in order to compute the
volume of T, we have related

137
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,010
to a parallelepiped, P, which
contains T. All right.

138
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,300
Now let's look at
the second part.

139
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,580
The second part says that if I
keep A1 and A2 unchanged, but

140
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,200
I move A3 a new point.

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,630
So A3 is going to be moved to
a point given by A3 prime.

142
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:23,310
And the coordinate is
-201, -199, and 104.

143
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,600
And I'm asking you to compute
the volume of the new

144
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,180
tetrahedron.

145
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,510
Well as you can see, this point
seems to be far away

146
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,590
from the origin.

147
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,610
I'm not even able to draw
this point here.

148
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,070
But you can imagine as this
point goes far away from the

149
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,480
origin, this spike is going to
become more and more pointy.

150
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,620
In other words, the entire
tetrahedron looks more and

151
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,010
more like a needle.

152
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,610
But nonetheless, we can
use the same method

153
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,670
to compute the volume.

154
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:04,130
So we follow the same idea, the
volume of T is going to be

155
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:10,420
equal to 1/6 of the volume of
P. And in this case, that's

156
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,660
going to become the absolute
value of the determinant of a

157
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,010
three by three matrix whose row
vectors are given by these

158
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,250
three edges.

159
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,420
So in this case, we again
copy down the

160
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,070
coordinates of three vertices.

161
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,250
The first one is 2, 2, -1.

162
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,300
The second one is 1, 3, 0.

163
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:48,850
The third one should become
this, so -201, 199, 104.

164
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,870
OK.

165
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,840
That should give me the volume
of the new tetrahedron.

166
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Let me call it T prime just to
differentiate it from the

167
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,980
previous tetrahedron.

168
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,950
And of course, you can compute
this determinant explicitly.

169
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:12,330
If you do so, you will see the
answer should be 2 again.

170
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,250
But in fact, there is a way that
you can just read out the

171
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,390
answer directly without
any real computation.

172
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,620
Let's pay attention
to the last row.

173
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,660
In other words, let's pay
attention to this new A3,

174
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,700
well, A3 prime.

175
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,430
What do you observe here?

176
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,940
A3 prime, if you consider the
difference between A3 and A3

177
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,990
prime, in other words, if you
consider how much you have

178
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:52,230
moved your apex, you will see
that's equal to -181.

179
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,870
Right?

180
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,690
So A3 is -1, 1, 4.

181
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,690
A3 prime is this.

182
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,720
That's exactly equal
to -100 times A1.

183
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,650
What does that mean?

184
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,160
Well from the point of view
of the matrix, you are

185
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,840
subtracting from the original
third row 100

186
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,190
times the first row.

187
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,470
But this row operation does not
change the determinant.

188
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,240
In other words, you know that
this determinant should be the

189
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,790
same as the previous one.

190
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,980
So you can write
out 2 directly.

191
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,080
From this picture, we can
also see that fact.

192
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,120
So from this picture, we know
that this section is saying

193
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,700
that I need to move A3 in the
inverse direction of A1

194
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,730
by 100 times A1.

195
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,500
So you're moving A3
parallel to A1.

196
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,410
But it doesn't matter how far
you've moved your apex.

197
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,120
You're moving in a way that
remains parallel to the base,

198
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,930
which is saying that
this movement does

199
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,210
not change the height.

200
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:13,150
Since A1 and A2 are fixed, your
base is fixed, and you're

201
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,730
not changing the height.

202
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,660
So of course, the volume
is not changing.

203
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,890
That's also a reason, another
way to see that the volume of

204
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,208
T prime is simply equal
to the volume of T.

205
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,580
OK, this completes
this problem.

206
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,450
I hope this example was
helpful to you.

207
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,160
And we should keep in mind
that the fact that the

208
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,420
determinant is related to volume
sometimes can become

209
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,740
very handy in computing
the volume of

210
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,210
certain geometric objects.

211
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,290
Thank you for watching, and
I'm looking forward

212
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,540
to seeing you soon.

213
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,098
