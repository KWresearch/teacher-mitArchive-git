00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,260
PROFESSOR: Hi, and welcome.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,550
Today, we're going
to do a problem

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,630
about powers of a matrix.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,380
Our problem is first to find a
formula for the k-th power of

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,310
this matrix C. This is a two by
two matrix that depends on

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,890
variables a and b.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,980
And the second part of our
problem is to calculate C to

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,710
the 100th in the special case
where a and b are -1.

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,640
You can hit pause now, and I'll
give you a minute to do

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,990
the problem yourself.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,210
And then, I'll come back and
we can do it together.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:57,620

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,720
OK.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,220
We're back.

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,980
Now what's the first step in
finding powers of a matrix?

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,130
Well, we need to find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

18
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,900
of this matrix.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,030
So how do we do that?

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:22,930
We compute the determinant of C
minus lambda I. This is the

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:29,090
determinant of this matrix.

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:43,410
2b minus a minus lambda, 2b
minus 2a, a minus b, and 2a

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,320
minus b minus lambda.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,780
OK.

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,940
If you compute this, well, we
have a lambda squared term.

26
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,760
OK.

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,270
Our lambda term, if you look
at it, you'll see we get 2b

28
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,470
minus a plus 2a minus b,
which is just a plus b.

29
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,680
And we have a negative sign.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,080
And it's negative a plus
b times lambda.

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,930
And our last term is a little
tougher to compute.

32
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,040
So I'll let you do
it yourself.

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,390
But you're just going
to get plus ab.

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:32,390
And this will factor as lambda
minus a times lambda minus b.

35
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,820
So our eigenvalues
are just a and b.

36
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,370
Now we need to find
our eigenvectors.

37
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,720
So how do we do that?

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,490
Well, what we need to do is we
need to look at C minus a

39
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,230
times the identity.

40
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,770
And we need to find the null
space of this matrix.

41
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,360
So what do we get here?

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,010
We get 2b minus 2a.

43
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,330

44
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:13,080
And then our next entry here,
we get 2a minus b minus a.

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,810
So this is a minus b.

46
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,850
Good.

47
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:27,310
So you can see that this matrix
has the same columns

48
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,740
and the same rows.

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,670
And so you can see that a vector
in the null space,

50
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:44,800
since this column is -2 times
this column, we can see that

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,290
our first eigenvector
is just--

52
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,050
or 1, 2, I should say.

53
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,973
It's just 1, 2.

54
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,223
Good.

55
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:58,220

56
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,280
Well, I guess we have space
to do the second one too.

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,950
Why not?

58
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,780
So let's write out the
second one also.

59
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,976
Here, we're subtracting
b instead of a.

60
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:14,020
You get b minus a.

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,620
You get 2b minus 2a.

62
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,870
We get a minus b.

63
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,430
And what do we have here?

64
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,071
We have 2a minus 2b.

65
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:28,400

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,000
So now, what's in the null
space of this matrix?

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,330
Well, what you can see is
that this column is

68
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,090
-1 times that column.

69
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:50,910
So our second eigenvector is
just going to be 1, 1.

70
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,020
And I should remind you that if
you have a harder example,

71
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,750
you can just find these null
spaces by elimination

72
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,490
like we always do.

73
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,040
Great.

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,610
Now we have our eigenvalues
and our eigenvectors.

75
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,990
So now we can write C in a nice
easy way that allows us

76
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,810
to take powers of it.

77
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,300
So what's that way?

78
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:21,060
So that's C equals S
lambda S inverse.

79
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,910
So this is just, what is S?

80
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,750
Remember, S is our matrix
of eigenvectors.

81
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,700
So S is the matrix 1, 2, 1, 1.

82
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,680
Good.

83
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,250
Now what is lambda?

84
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,180
Lambda is the matrix
of eigenvalues.

85
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,450
Right?

86
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,360
So it's just a and b.

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,330
Those are the diagonal entries
of my lambda matrix.

88
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,110
And then, we just
find S inverse.

89
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:00,550
So we just take negative signs
here and recall that we have

90
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,340
to divide by the determinant.

91
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,840
And the determinant of this
matrix is just -1.

92
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,080
So we just change
the signs there.

93
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Good.

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,610
So this is our nice
decomposition of C. Now how do

95
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,740
we take powers of C?

96
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,820
Well, C to the k is just S
lambda to the k, S inverse.

97
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,360

98
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,160
1, 1, 2, 1.

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,660
a to the k.

100
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,930
b to the k.

101
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,040
-1, 1, 2, -1.

102
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,020
Good.

103
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:47,890
And multiplying these matrices
together, just do a little

104
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,140
arithmetic here.

105
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,660

106
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,880
Got a bunch of powers
of a and b.

107
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,040
Because we take powers
of the eigenvalues.

108
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,050
We have here, we have 2b to
the k minus a to the k.

109
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,540
Have a to the k minus
b to the k.

110
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,390

111
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,820
2b to the k minus 2a to the k.

112
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:27,800
And finally, we get 2a to
the k minus b to the k.

113
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,540
And this is our k-th
power matrix.

114
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,360

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,610
Good.

116
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,560

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,305
A quick check.

118
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:39,900
It's always good to check
your work here.

119
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,880
Let's plug in k equals 1.

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
And what do we get?

121
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:51,080
We get 2b minus a, a minus b,
2b minus 2a, and 2a minus b.

122
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,010
And if we can go all the way
back to our matrix at the very

123
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,480
beginning, all the way back
here, that agrees perfectly

124
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,550
with what we started with.

125
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,250
So that's good.

126
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,300
That means that we did this
decomposition right.

127
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,810
Good.

128
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,160
So now, we've computed the k-th
power of this matrix.

129
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,750
Let's do a particular example.

130
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,380
So let's plug in
a and b are -1.

131
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,470
So a equals b equals -1.

132
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,690
And k equals 100.

133
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,240
Then what do we get?

134
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,060
Well -1 to the 100th
is just 1.

135
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,830
So we're just plugging in 1 for
b to the k and a to the k

136
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,950
everywhere.

137
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,700
And we just get, in this
case, C to the 100th is

138
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,420
just 1, 0, 0, 1.

139
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,160
It's just the identity matrix.

140
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,720
Great.

141
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,300
Great.

142
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,790
OK.

143
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,800
Now to summarize, how do we
take powers of a matrix?

144
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,940
Well, first we diagonalize.

145
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,980
We write our matrix as
S lambda, S inverse.

146
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,380
And then, we just take powers
of the diagonal matrix.

147
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,858
