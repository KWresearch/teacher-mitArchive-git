1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,980

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,430
PROFESSOR: Hi, and welcome.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,180
Today we're going to do a
problem about least squares

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,910
approximations.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,510
Here's the question.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,920
Find the quadratic equation
through the origin that is a

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,400
best fit for these three
points (1, 1), (2,

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,060
5), and (-1, -2).

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,150
I'll give you a minute to work
that out on your own.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,430
You can hit the pause button
now, and we'll be back in a

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,440
minute to work the problem
out together.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:47,430

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,690
OK and we're back.

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,790
So what's the first step
in a problem like this?

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,220
The first step is figuring out
what our equation looks like,

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,280
the one that we're
going to find.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,320
So our equation is going
to look like ct plus dt

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,150
squared equals y.

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,790
So that's what we're
looking for.

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,780
We're looking for a quadratic
equation through the origin.

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,960
Now if it were just any
quadratic equation, then we

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,180
would have a constant term, but
through the origin just

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,730
means that the constant
term is 0.

24
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,250
Now what's the next step?

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,980
Next we need to set up
a matrix equation.

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:45,410
So we need an A, a matrix
A. And which matrix is

27
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,740
that going to be?

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,090
Well, let me start with the
first coordinate of these

29
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,790
three points.

30
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,710
And I'm going to put them in
the first column of this

31
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,200
matrix, 1, 2, -1.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,680
And then my second column is
going to be the squares of

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,410
these coordinates,
1, 4, and 1.

34
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,370
And my x hat--

35
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,490
that's just c and d.

36
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,620
And my b--

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,460
this is going to be the second
coordinate, 1, 5, and -2.

38
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,820

39
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,960
OK, why did I set this
problem up like that?

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,950
Well, multiply A times x hat.

41
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,660
The first coordinate of A
times x hat is 1 times c

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,720
plus 1 times d.

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,670
It's just the same as plugging
in this first point into the

44
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,670
left hand side of
this equation.

45
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,690
And similarly, if I took the
second point and plugged it in

46
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,500
here, I would just get 2 times
c plus 4 times d, which is

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,520
just the same as the second
coordinate in the

48
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,840
multiplication A times x hat.

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,490
2 times c plus 4 times d.

50
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,120
OK and where did the
b come from?

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,010
Well, b came from plugging
in these points to

52
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,680
the right hand side.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,740
So 1, 5, and -2 are just
the y-coordinates

54
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,720
of these three points.

55
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,070
So it would be great if we could
solve A x hat equals b.

56
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:37,070
But we can't solve A x hat
equals b, because there isn't

57
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,200
a quadratic equation through the
origin that contains these

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,500
three points.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,610
But we need to find the best
approximation to that, so

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,580
that's the same as solving A x
hat equals the projection of b

61
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,910
onto the column space of A.
Because we only have a chance

62
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,460
of solving A x hat equals
something if it's in the

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,960
column space of A. And remember
from our projections

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:09,930
part of the class that this
is the same as solving A

65
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,340
transpose A x hat equals
A transpose b.

66
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,180

67
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,540
So that's what we're
really going to do.

68
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,210
We're really going to solve A
transpose A x hat equals A

69
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,640
transpose b.

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,840
And now all we have to do
is just the computation.

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,400
So let's do it.

72
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,190

73
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,210
So what is A transpose A?

74
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm going to do this kind of
quickly, because you should be

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,400
good at multiplying
matrices by now.

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:56,130

77
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,700
Oh this--

78
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,380
I have the negative in the
wrong place, thank you.

79
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,475
Thanks for that correction.

80
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:06,470
I have the negative
backwards there.

81
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,390

82
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,065
And what do I get when
I multiply these?

83
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,340
I'll let you check.

84
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:22,560
This is 6, 8, 8, and 10.

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,650
And what is A transpose b?

86
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:34,620

87
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,800
Well, if you multiply this out,
I'll let you check that

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,540
you get 13 and 19.

89
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,780
So this is just some
computation.

90
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,200
And so what we're solving here
is 6, 8, 8, 10 times x hat

91
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,720
equals 13, 19.

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,640
And we remember how to do this
just by using elimination.

93
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,610
We replace the second row by 3
times the second row minus 4

94
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,090
times the first row.

95
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,010
Again, I'm going to do this
quickly because you know this

96
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,260
from other parts of the class.

97
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,280

98
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,740
You similarly change the b
vector, and we back solve to

99
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:34,370
get d is -5/2 and c equals--

100
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,130
let's plug that in and see--

101
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,330
think you're going
to get 11 over 2.

102
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,330
So what's our final equation?

103
00:06:44,330 --> 00:07:04,290
Our final equation is y equals
11/2 t minus 5/2 t squared.

104
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,780
OK.

105
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,920
So this is our best
fit quadratic

106
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,150
equation through the origin.

107
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,400
Now before I end, let me
do a couple things.

108
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,050
First, let me go back
and review what

109
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,460
the key steps were.

110
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,380
Whenever you're faced with
such a best fit equation,

111
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,230
first, you want to see what
the general form of the

112
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,670
equation is.

113
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,490
Next you want to write it
in terms of matrices.

114
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,780
Write down your matrix
A and your vector b.

115
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,750
And lastly, you set up your
projection equation.

116
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,480
And then all you have to do
is just a computation.

117
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,410
But it might also be worth
noting that these three points

118
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,210
certainly aren't on this
quadratic equation.

119
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,540
For instance, if I plug in 1
here, I don't get (1, 1), I

120
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,560
get (1, 3).

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,230
But that's OK.

122
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,910
This is as close as we can do.

123
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,160
Thanks.

124
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,818
