00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,350
LINAN CHEN: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,300
I'm Linan.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,300
Welcome back to recitation.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,270
In recent lectures, we have
studied the properties of the

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,050
determinant.

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,130
And we also derived the
formula to compute it.

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,620
Today we're going to put what
we learned into practice by

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,480
considering these
two examples.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,870
So we want to find out the
determinants of these two 5 by

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,880
5 matrices.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,880
And as you can see, matrix A has
x along this diagonal, and

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,310
in the first four rows, y to
the right of x, except

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,750
for the last row.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,730
And 0 entries everywhere else.

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,290
And matrix B also has x along
this diagonal and

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,220
y everywhere else.

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,490
Before starting, let me help you
review what you can do to

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,740
compute determinants.

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,110
Of course, you can carry out
elimination to transform your

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,040
original matrix into upper
triangular matrix.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,570
Or you can use this big
summation formula.

23
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,010
Another choice would be you
can do it by cofactors.

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,490
Namely, you can expand your
original matrix along any row

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,610
or any column, and then the
determinant is simply given by

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,870
the dot product of
that row or that

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,150
column with its cofactors.

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,730
Why don't you pause the
video now and try to

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,440
work on them yourself.

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,490
Whenever you're ready, I'll come
back and show you my way.

31
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:46,990

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,080
I hope you just had some fun
with these two problems. Now

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,290
let's look at them together.

34
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,750
Let's look at matrix A first.
As you can see, there are a

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,540
lot of 0 entries in matrix A.
So perhaps you don't need

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,270
elimination to introduce
more 0s.

37
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,350
Furthermore, we observe this
pattern of A, and you notice

38
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,800
that if I cover the last row
and the first column, so if

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
this column and this row and not
here, what is left over is

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,140
simply a 4 by 4 lower
triangular matrix.

41
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,410
And similarly, if you cover the
first column and the first

42
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,980
row, what is left over here
is simply a 4 by 4 upper

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,030
triangular matrix.

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,630
This is telling us that we
should calculate the

45
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,850
determinant of A by
the third method.

46
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,910
So we should expand along the
first column of A, and we

47
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,920
calculate the cofactors.

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,020
Let's do it now.

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:03:01,640
So determinant of A, is equal
to the 1 1 entry of A, which

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,240
is x times the cofactor of
that spot, which is the

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,080
determinant of the leftover
4 by 4 matrix.

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,200
And its upper triangular, so
its determinant is simply

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,450
given by x to the power 4.

54
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,610
Plus, the only other non-0 entry
in that column is the y

55
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,860
at the very bottom.

56
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,530
So you put y here.

57
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,180
And you multiply y by the
cofactor of that spot, which

58
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,130
is the determinant of the
leftover 4 by 4 matrix again.

59
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,610
In this case, it's lower
triangular and its determinant

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,660
is y to the power 4.

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,480
So I have a y to the power 4.

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,520
But not quite.

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,090
In principle, there should
be another factor here

64
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,150
indicating the sign.

65
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,650
And the sign in this case,
well because the y is the

66
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,110
entry in the fifth row
and the first column.

67
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,430
So this factor should
be negative 1 to the

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,670
power 5 plus 1.

69
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,839
And of course, is just 1.

70
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:24,450
So the determinant of A is
simply equal to x to the fifth

71
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,780
power plus y to the
fifth power.

72
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,180
Did you get the correct
answer?

73
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,660
Well the determinant of A is
not too bad because A has a

74
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,310
lot of 0 entries.

75
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,060
Now let's look at the
determinant of matrix B.

76
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,320
I have another copy of B here.

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,710
So B also has a very
clear structure.

78
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,080
It has x along its diagonal,
and y everywhere else.

79
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,520
But in general, B does
not have an 0 entry.

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,510
So perhaps our first step
should be carrying out

81
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,000
elimination to introduce 0
entries into matrix B.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,370
Of course, you can do it
by the regular routine.

83
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,300
You start with the first row,
find a pivot, and eliminate

84
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,750
the second row and the third
row and so on and so forth.

85
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,870
But in this case, there's
a shortcut.

86
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,810
If you compare two rows that
are next to each other, for

87
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,920
example, if we compare the
fourth row and the fifth row,

88
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,030
you notice that they have a
lot of entries in common.

89
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,450
And they're only different
at these two spots.

90
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,830
So imagine if I subtract the
fourth row from the fifth row.

91
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,360
So if I do the following
operation.

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,620
So I subtract this row
from the last row.

93
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,290
Then the new fifth row should
become the following.

94
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:09,580
So this row will become 0 0
0, y minus x, x minus y.

95
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,860

96
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,740
You see, just by the simple
operation, I have introduced

97
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,830
three 0 entries at once.

98
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,420

99
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,640
And it's similarly with the
fourth row and the third row.

100
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,030
They have common entries
here, here, and here.

101
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,670
So you subtract the third
row from the fourth row.

102
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,520

103
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:46,410
You update the fourth row to 0
0, y minus x, x minus y, 0.

104
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,210
Again, three 0 entries.

105
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,990
And same thing happened to the
second row and the third row.

106
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,950
So you subtract the second row
from the third row and your

107
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:08,290
new third row will become 0,
y minus x, x minus y, 0 0.

108
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,860
Finally, you subtract the first
row from the second row,

109
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,330
and then you update the second
row to y minus x, x

110
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,210
minus y, 0 0 0.

111
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,190
Let's keep the first
row unchanged.

112
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,720
So I'm going to copy here.

113
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,990

114
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,630
All right.

115
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,050
By row elimination, we have
introduced many 0 entries to

116
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,120
matrix B. Is there anything
else that I can

117
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,640
take advantage of?

118
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,090
Let's observe the pattern
of this new matrix.

119
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,740
As you can see, in each row,
you have two non-0 entries,

120
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,420
except the first row.

121
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,850
And they're only different
by a sign.

122
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,910
So if somehow you can figure out
a way to sum them up, you

123
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,540
will get even more 0 entries.

124
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,900
So let's do it.

125
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,930
That's going to involve the
operations on column.

126
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,880
So here is how I do it.

127
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,720

128
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,310
I'm going to keep the last
column unchanged.

129
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:28,540
So the last column is
y 0 0 0 x minus y.

130
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,870

131
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,980
What I will do is I will add a
copy of the last column to the

132
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,220
fourth column.

133
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,230
So this is what I'm
going to do.

134
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:46,450
Add one copy of the last column
to the fourth column.

135
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:57,890
Now the new fourth column will
become 2y 0 0 x minus y 0.

136
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,440
As you can see by doing this,
I have killed the spot.

137
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,420
So I have introduced one more 0
entry into my fourth column.

138
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,980
If you continue, you may want
to add the fourth column to

139
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,200
the third column.

140
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,840
Let's see what will happen
if you do that.

141
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:24,140
So if you add the fourth column
to the third column,

142
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:35,311
now what should appear here is
2y 0 x minus y 0 y minus x.

143
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,770

144
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:44,800
But in this new third column,
you still have two 0 entries,

145
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,470
which is the same as the
original third column.

146
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,630
So although you've killed this
spot, but you've introduced a

147
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,070
new non-0 entry.

148
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,260
So is there a way that we
can kill this spot too?

149
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,130
You may have noticed that if
you add a copy of the fifth

150
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,520
column to this column again,
then that spot

151
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,560
will have been killed.

152
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,780
So let's do it.

153
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,350
If I add this column to
this one, I'm going to

154
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,010
just update it here.

155
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:24,470
Then the first entry
should become 3y.

156
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,060
These are unchanged.

157
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,400
And the last spot becomes 0.

158
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,680

159
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,370
It reflects here as you are
adding a copy of the fourth

160
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,810
column and a copy of the fifth
column to the third column.

161
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,560
Now you've got the idea.

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,130
And you continue.

163
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,050
What do you do with
the second column?

164
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:58,700
This time you will have to add
a copy of the third column, a

165
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,020
copy of the fourth column, and
the copy of the fifth column.

166
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,030

167
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,940
So you update the second
column to be 4y

168
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,040
x minus y 0 0 0.

169
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,630

170
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,520
Eventually, what you will do to
the first column would be

171
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,770
you add everything to
the first column.

172
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,920
So a copy of each.

173
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:41,360

174
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,710
Then the first column
will become--

175
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,540
so I don't have in that spot
here, so we'll make it here--

176
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,870
x plus 4y.

177
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,070
Then everything else is 0.

178
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,290
This is fun.

179
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,110
And the result's really nice.

180
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,260
This is wonderful because
this is simply

181
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,080
upper triangular matrix.

182
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,390
Now you tell me what is the
determinant of B. The

183
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:12,750
determinant of B is the
determinant of this upper

184
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,240
triangular matrix.

185
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,840
So you simply multiply
everything together, that's x

186
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:27,100
plus 4y times x minus y
to the fourth power.

187
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,640

188
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,480
So I hope you enjoyed
these two examples.

189
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,930
Maybe your method is different
from mine, but at least these

190
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,780
two examples teach us that you
can be flexible in combining

191
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,570
methods in calculating
determinants.

192
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,100
Thanks for watching,
and I'm looking

193
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,350
forward to see you soon.

194
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,085
