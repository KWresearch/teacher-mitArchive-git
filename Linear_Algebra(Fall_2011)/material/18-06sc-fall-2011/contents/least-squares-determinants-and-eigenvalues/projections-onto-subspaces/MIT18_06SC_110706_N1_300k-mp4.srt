00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,688

2
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:08,300
PROFESSOR: Hi, guys.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,560
My name is Nikola, and in this
video, we're going to work out

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,680
an example of an orthogonal
projection matrix.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,540
Specifically, we are gonna
compute the projection matrix

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,460
onto the plane given by
the equation x plus y

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,480
minus z equals 0.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,240
So before we start, let
me just recall what a

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,350
projection matrix is.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:35,170
So you've seen this sketch here
a million times already.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,930
A projection matrix takes any
vector in three-space--

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,750
well, just in this case we are
dealing with a three-space--

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,980
and projects it down onto the
plane, a two dimensional

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,840
subspace of our three.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,390
So I'll give you a few moments
to consider the problem for

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,120
yourselves.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,640
And then you'll see
my take on it.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:10,657

19
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,900
Hi again.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,510
So in lecture, Professor Strang
derived, in meticulous

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,990
detail, the formula for
the projection matrix.

22
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,850
So it was given by the following
slightly complicated

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,900
expression.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:38,410
It's A times A transpose A
inverse A transpose where A is

25
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,480
a matrix that somehow
encodes the subspace

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,320
we're projecting on.

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:53,820
In particular, A has, as
its columns, A1, A2--

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,490
I'm going to denote them--

29
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,080
a basis for the plane
we're projecting on.

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,035
So essentially, what we need to
do is find two such vectors

31
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:12,490
that span the plane and start
computing with a matrix.

32
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,960
This is fairly straightforward.

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,320

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,060
One choice that works, for
example, is 1, -1, 0 for the

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,970
first column, and 1, 0, 1
for the second column.

36
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,430

37
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:51,500
And let me write out the matrix
A. So in the formula,

38
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,510
the slightly more complicated
combination, this A transpose

39
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,270
A inverse, so let me compute
that first for you.

40
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:08,900
So A transpose A is
a 2 by 2 matrix.

41
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:18,780
And it's not so hard to figure
out that it's 2 and 1, 1, 2.

42
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:29,990
Now we shall invert it using
the familiar formula 1 over

43
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,190
the determinant.

44
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,260
2 times 2 minus 1 is 3.

45
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,470
And so we switch the diagonal
entries, and we flip the signs

46
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,720
of the other diagonal ones.

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,410

48
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,620
Right.

49
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,240
And therefore, projection matrix
given by the following

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:04:15,960
product of matrices 1/3, 2, -1,
-1, 2, and then transpose

51
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,239
of A, which is 1,
-1, 0, 1, 0, 1.

52
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:25,650

53
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm gonna carry out this
multiplication in inhumanly

54
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,650
fast fashion.

55
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:39,625
So I'm just gonna write down the
answer, which is 1/3, 2,

56
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:45,070
-1, 1, -1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1.

57
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,680

58
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,060
So what you can do now is--

59
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,970
well, you can check whether
this answer

60
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,680
actually makes sense.

61
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,700
One thing you can do is just--

62
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,850
well, a projection matrix is
supposed to take the normal to

63
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,090
the plane down to 0.

64
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:14,090
So you can just multiply P and
the normal vector 1, 1, -1.

65
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,700
And if you get 0, maybe you've
done a good job.

66
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,940
Another curious thing that I
would like to point out here

67
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,930
is so you see we had lots of
freedom choosing the matrix A.

68
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,980
We could have chosen any two
columns that span the

69
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,060
subspace, that spans
the plane.

70
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,980
The beautiful thing about it is
that in the end, we'll get

71
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,230
the same answer.

72
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,510

73
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,870
So I hope there will be many
of you who would say, hey,

74
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,870
there is an easier way
to do the problem.

75
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,600
And I'll agree with
these people.

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:01,590
So let's see what would
be an easier approach.

77
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:08,450
Well, let's go back to
the sketch here.

78
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,910
And let's make the following
observation, that any vector

79
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,970
is a sum of two components.

80
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,540
The first component is its
projection onto the plane.

81
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,100
And the other component is its
projection onto the orthogonal

82
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,730
complement of the plane, in
this case, onto the normal

83
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,620
vector through the plane.

84
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,370
So in the language of linear
algebra, this is just b equals

85
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:45,770
to its projection onto the plane
plus its projection--

86
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,820
I'm gonna call it PN--

87
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,700
onto the orthogonal complement
of the plane.

88
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,650

89
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,340
I'm gonna suggestively write
here the identity matrix so

90
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,510
that you can immediately read
off a matrix equality.

91
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,950
Associated with this equality
here, it's the identity

92
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,770
equals P plus PN.

93
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,890
And therefore, the projection
matrix is just the identity

94
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,510
minus the projection matrix
onto the normal vector.

95
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:27,450
Now, this object here, PN, is
much easier to compute, well,

96
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,910
for two reasons.

97
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,670
First one is that projecting
onto a one dimensional

98
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,730
subspace is infinitely easier
than projecting onto a higher

99
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,350
dimensional subspace.

100
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,580
And second, we already have--

101
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,460
well, immediately we can read
off from the equation of the

102
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,750
plane where the normal
vector is.

103
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,570
So we don't have derive
these guys.

104
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,250
We don't have to do
what we did here.

105
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:07,050
So essentially, PN will be N N

106
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,900
transpose N inverse N transpose.

107
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,050

108
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:26,160
And that's equal to 1, 1, -1.

109
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,980

110
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,669
And N transpose N inverse,
this is just a number.

111
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,620
It's 1 over the magnitude of the
normal vector, so that's--

112
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,429
then, the magnitude squared.

113
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:45,105
So that's 3 and 1, -1.

114
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:48,510

115
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,760
I'm gonna--

116
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,540

117
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:13,953
The answer here, it's 1/3, 1, 1,
-1, 1, 1, -1, and -1, 1, 1.

118
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:25,070

119
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,340
And in order to get the
projection matrix--

120
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,773
yes?

121
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,505
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

122
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:32,430
PROFESSOR: Oh.

123
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,270
Thank you.

124
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,320
Thank you.

125
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,850
And in order to get the
projection matrix, we just

126
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,750
subtract from the identity
this expression.

127
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,210
And you can confirm
that it's--

128
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,170
we get the same answer
as here.

129
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,420
I think we're done here.

130
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,378
