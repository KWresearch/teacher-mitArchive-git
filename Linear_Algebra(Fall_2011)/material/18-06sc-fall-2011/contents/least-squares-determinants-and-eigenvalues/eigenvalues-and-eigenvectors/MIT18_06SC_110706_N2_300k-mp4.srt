00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,830
PROFESSOR: Hi guys, today we are
going to play around with

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,040
the basics of eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,380
We're going to do the following
problem, we're given

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,700
this invertible matrix, a, and
we'll find the eigenvalues and

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:30,730
eigenvectors not of a, but of a
squared and a inverse minus

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,630
the identity.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,970
So, this problem might seem
daunting at first, squaring a

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,850
3 by 3 matrix, or taking an
inverse of a 3 by 3 matrix is

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,550
a fairly computationally
intensive task, but if you've

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,310
seen Professor Strang's lecture
on eigenvalues and

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,910
eigenvectors you shouldn't
be all too worried.

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,460
So I'll give you a few moments
to think of your own line of

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,650
attack and then you'll
see mine.

15
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:11,120

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,570
Hi again, OK, so the observation
that makes our

17
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,480
life really easy is
the following one.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:29,060
So say v is an eigenvector with
associated eigenvalue to

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:39,540
the matrix a, then if we hit v
with a squared well, this we

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,120
can write it as a times a v,
but a v is lambda v, right?

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,150
So we have a lambda v.

22
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,965
Lambda is a scalar, so we can
move it in front and get

23
00:01:55,965 --> 00:02:03,670
lambda a v, and lambda a v is,
when we plug in a v lambda v,

24
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:10,830
is lambda squared v. So, what
we've find out is that if v is

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,670
an eigenvector for a
then it's also an

26
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,450
eigenvector for a squared.

27
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,840
Just the eigenvalue is the
eigenvalue squared.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,990
Similarly, if we had
a inverse, if you

29
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,070
hit v with a inverse.

30
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:38,760
So in this case we can write v
as av over lambda, given that

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,150
of course, lambda is non-zero.

32
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,475
But the eigenvalues of an
invertible matrix are always

33
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:52,560
non-zero, which is an exercise
you should do yourselves.

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:02,005
So if we just then take out the
a and combine it with a

35
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:10,660
inverse, this is the identity,
and so we get 1 over lambda v.

36
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,080
So v is also an eigenvector for
a inverse, with eigenvalue

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,060
there is a reciprocal
of lambda.

38
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:26,780
OK, and from here of course, A
inverse minus the identity is

39
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:40,330
lambda inverse minus 1 v, so
the eigenvalue of A inverse

40
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,920
minus the identities, 1
over lambda minus 1.

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,950
OK, so, what we've figured out
is we just need to find the

42
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,060
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
A and then we have a way of

43
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,160
finding what the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of A squared

44
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,290
and A inverse minus the
identity will be.

45
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,570
OK so, how do we find
the eigenvalues?

46
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:17,750
Well what does it mean
for lambda to be an

47
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,180
eigenvalue of A?

48
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,580
It means that the matrix A minus
lambda, the identity is

49
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,740
singular, which is precisely
the case when its

50
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,220
determinant is 0, OK?

51
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:50,340
So we need to solve the
following equation 1 minus

52
00:04:50,340 --> 00:05:06,640
lambda, 2, 3, 0, 1 minus lambda,
2, -2, and 0, 1, 4

53
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,420
minus lambda.

54
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:18,290
OK, it's fairly obvious which
column we should use to expand

55
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,190
this determinant.

56
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,880
We should use the first column,
because we have only

57
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:32,550
one 0 entry, and so this is
equal to 1 minus lambda times

58
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,730
the determinant of the
two by two matrix.

59
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,698

60
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:50,220
1 minus lambda, -2, 1, 4 minus
lambda, which is, I'm going to

61
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,590
do the computation up here.

62
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,740

63
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:08,260
1 minus lambda, lambda squared
minus 5 lambda plus six.

64
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:16,670
Which is a fairly familiar
quadratic, and we can write it

65
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,500
as the product of
linear factors.

66
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:26,090
Lambda minus 2, lambda minus
three, so the three

67
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:33,000
eigenvalues of A are
1, 2, and 3.

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,010
OK so, first half of our problem
is done, now we just

69
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,000
need to find what the
eigenvectors associated with

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,740
each of these eigenvalues are.

71
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,562
How we do that, well
let's see.

72
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:55,190
Let's figure out what the
eigenvector associated with

73
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,440
lambda equals 1 is.

74
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,260

75
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,940
So, we know that the vector
needs to be in the null space

76
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,660
of A minus lambda, the identity,
so A minus the

77
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:15,340
identity, v, so--

78
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,010
write this out--

79
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:37,740
it's, 0, 0, 3, 2,
3, 0, -2, 0, 1.

80
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:49,330
And we see that the first column
is 0, so the first

81
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,510
variable will be our free
variable if we want to solve

82
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,840
this linear system
of equations.

83
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,360

84
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,880
And you can just set it to 1 and
it's not hard to see that

85
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,950
the other two entries
should be zero.

86
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,630
So we can do the same procedure
with the other two

87
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:23,415
eigenvalues and yeah will get
you an eigenvector for each

88
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:24,540
eigenvalue.

89
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,280
And in the end you
go back here.

90
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,100

91
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:36,010
So I'm going to put our results
in a little table.

92
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:46,830
So A squared inverse equals the
identity, so the first row

93
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,560
will be eigenvalues.

94
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,920

95
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,000
So it's going to be lambda is
an eigenvalue for A, and we

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,390
saw that lambda squared will
be the eigenvalue for A

97
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:10,020
squared and lambda inverse
minus 1 will be the value

98
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,460
inverse minus the identity,
and the

99
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,630
eigenvectors will be the same.

100
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,880
OK, we're done.

101
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,983
