00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,279

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:07,380
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,520
Welcome back.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,390
So today, I'd like to tackle a
problem in Markov matrices.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,220
Specifically, we're going to
start with this problem which

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,540
almost has a physics origin.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,290
If we have a particle that jumps
between positions A and

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,470
B with the following
probabilities--

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,560
I'll just state it--

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,300
if it starts at A and jumps to
B with probability 0.4 or

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,080
starts at A and stays at A with
probability 0.6 or if it

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,370
starts at B then it goes to A
with probability 0.2 or stays

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,850
at B with probability 0.8,
we'd like to note the

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,820
evolution of the probability of
this particle over a long

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,690
period of time.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,000
So specifically the problem
we're interested today is if

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,040
we have a particle and we know
that it starts at position A,

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,610
what is the probability that
it is at position A and the

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,800
probability that it's at
position B after one step,

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,110
after n steps, and then finally
after an infinite

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,420
number of steps?

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,430
So I'll let you think about this
problem for a moment and

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,680
I'll be back.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:17,460

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,580
Hi everyone.

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,370
Welcome back.

27
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,290
So the main difficulty with
this problem is that it's

28
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,800
phrased as a physics problem.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,110
And we need to convert it into
some mathematical language to

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,990
get a handle on it.

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,910
So specifically, what we'd like
to do is to convert this

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,670
into a matrix formulism.

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,120
So what we can do is we can
write this little graph down

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,990
and describe everything in this
graph using a matrix.

35
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,340
So I'm going to call this matrix
A, and I'm going to

36
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:56,300
associate the first row of A
with particle position A and

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,250
particle position B. And I'll
associate the first and second

38
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,740
columns with particles positions
A and B. And then

39
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,200
what I'm going to do is I'm
going to fill in this matrix

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,270
with the probability
distributions.

41
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,490
So, specifically what's going to
go in this top left corner?

42
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,350
Well, the number 0.6, which
represents the probability

43
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,505
that I stay at position A, given
that I start at position

44
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:33,060
A. What's going to go here in
the bottom left hand corner?

45
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,290
Well, we're going to put 0.4,
because this is the

46
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,350
probability that I wind up at
B, given that I start at A.

47
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,250
And then lastly, we'll fill in
these other two columns or the

48
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,995
second column with
0.8 and 0.2.

49
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:56,690

50
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,870
So I'll just state briefly
this is what's

51
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,210
called a Markov matrix.

52
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,990
And it's called Markov, because
first off, every

53
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,460
element is positive or 0.

54
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,840
And secondly, the sum of the
elements in each column is 1.

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,520
So if we note 0.4 plus 0.6
is 1, 0.8 plus 0.2 is 1.

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,970
And these matrices come up all
the time when we're talking

57
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,510
about probabilities and the
evolution of probability

58
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,530
distributions.

59
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,110
OK.

60
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,470
So now once we've encoded this
graph using this matrix A, we

61
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,480
now want to tackle
this problem.

62
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,230
So I'm going to introduce the
vector P, and I'm going to use

63
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,560
a subscript 0 is to denote the
probability that the particle

64
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,630
is at time 0.

65
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:50,400
So we're told that the particle
starts at position A.

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,240
So at time 0, I'm going to use
the vector 1, 0 again.

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:04,190
I'm going to match the top
component of this vector with

68
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,310
the top component of this matrix
and the first column of

69
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,700
this matrix.

70
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,380
And then likewise the second
component of this vector with

71
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,480
the second row and second
column of this matrix.

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,670
And we're interested in how does
this probability evolve

73
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,620
as the particle takes
many steps.

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:35,610
So for one step, what's the
probability of the particle

75
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,770
going to be?

76
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,150
Well, this is the beauty of
introducing matrix notation.

77
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,700
I'm going to denote P1 to be
the probability of the

78
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,160
particle after one step.

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,580
And we see that we can write
this as the matrix A

80
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,160
multiplied by P0.

81
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,030

82
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:07,570
So the answer is 0.6 and 0.4.

83
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,790
And I achieve this just by
multiplying this matrix by

84
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,620
this vector.

85
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:11,790
OK?

86
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,050
So this concludes part one.

87
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,770

88
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,240
Now part two is a
little trickier.

89
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,490
So part two is n-steps.

90
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,510

91
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,590
And to tackle this problem,
we need to use

92
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,750
a little more machinery.

93
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,550
So first off, I'm going to note
that P1 is A times P0.

94
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,620

95
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,310
Likewise, P2--

96
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,530
so this is the position of
the-- the probability

97
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,940
distribution of the particle
after two steps.

98
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:52,860
This is A times P1, which
is A squared times P0.

99
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,000
And we note that there's
a general trend.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,560
After n-steps--

101
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,370
so Pn--

102
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,600
the general trend is it's going
to be this matrix A

103
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,230
raised to the nth power,
multiply the vector P0.

104
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,920
So how do we take the
nth of a matrix?

105
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,760
Well, this is where we use
eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

106
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:25,120
So recall, that we can take
any matrix A that's

107
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:33,960
diagonizable and write it as
U D U inverse, where D is a

108
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,140
diagonal matrix and this matrix
U is a matrix whose

109
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,480
columns correspond to the
eigenvectors of A.

110
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,580
So for this problem I'm, just
going to state what the

111
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,830
eigenvalues and eigenvectors
are.

112
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,050
And I'll let you
work them out.

113
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,500
So because it's a Markov matrix,
we always have an

114
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,780
eigenvalue which is 1.

115
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,680
And in this case, we have
an eigenvector U

116
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,130
which is 1 and 2.

117
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,160

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,440
In addition, the second
eigenvalue is 0.4.

119
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,530
And the eigenvector
corresponding to

120
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,070
this one is 1, -1.

121
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,750
And I'll just call these
U1 and U2, like that.

122
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:30,670

123
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:37,420
OK, we can now write this big
matrix U as 1, 2, 1, -1.

124
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,580

125
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,020
D is going to be--

126
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,580
now I have to match things up.

127
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,540
If I'm going to put the first
eigenvector in the first

128
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,150
column, we have to stick 1 in
the first column as well and

129
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,620
then 0.4 like this.

130
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,410
And then lastly, we also have
U inverse which I can just

131
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:17,760
work out to be -1/3, one over
the determinant, times -1, -1,

132
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:29,740
-2, and 1, which simplifies
to this.

133
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:40,980
OK, so now if we take A and
raise it to the power of n, we

134
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,809
have this nice identity that
all the U and U inverses

135
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,040
collapse in the middle.

136
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,900
And we're left with U, D to
the n, U inverse, P0.

137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,460

138
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,130
Now raising the a diagonal
matrix to the power of n is a

139
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,400
relatively simple thing to do.

140
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,480
We just take the eigenvalues
and raise them to

141
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,020
the power of n.

142
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,860
So when we compute this product,
there's a question of

143
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,720
what order do we do things?

144
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,240
Now these are 2 by 2 matrices,
so in theory we could just

145
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,630
multiply a 2 by 2 matrix, 2 by
2 matrix, 2 by 2 matrix, and

146
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,540
then on a vector which
is a 2 by 1 matrix.

147
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,160
But if you're in a test and
you're cramped for time, you

148
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,950
want to do as little
computations as possible.

149
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,840
So what you want to do is you
want to start on the right

150
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,170
hand side and then
work backwards.

151
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:40,530
So if we do this, we end up
obtaining 1, 2, this is going

152
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:47,795
to be to the power
of n, 1/3, 1, 2.

153
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,870

154
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,600
OK, so for this last part, I'm
just going to write down the

155
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,570
final answer.

156
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,890
And I'll let you work out the
multiplication of matrices.

157
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:13,820
So we have for Pn, 1/3, 2 times
0.4 to the n, plus 1,

158
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:21,430
-2, 0.4 to the n, plus 2.

159
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,160
And this is the final
vector for P of n.

160
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,980
So this finishes up Part 2.

161
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,970
And then lastly for Part
3, what happens

162
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,930
when n goes to infinity?

163
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,740
Well, we have the answer
for any n.

164
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,410
So we can just take the limit
as n goes to infinity.

165
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,220
Now, specifically as n goes to
infinity, 0.4 raised to some

166
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,040
very large power vanishes.

167
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,150
So these two terms drop off.

168
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,860
And at the end of the day,
we're left with P

169
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:58,130
infinity is 1/3 1, 2.

170
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,240
OK?

171
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,430
So just to recap, we started off
with a particle starting

172
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,940
at A, and then after a very long
time, the particle winds

173
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,790
up with a probability
distribution which

174
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,030
is 1/3 1 and 2.

175
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,910
And this is quite characteristic
of Markov

176
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,290
matrix chains.

177
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:27,230
Specifically, we note that 1/3
1, 2 is a multiple of the

178
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,340
eigenvector corresponding
to eigenvalue 1.

179
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,980
So even though the particle
started at position A, after a

180
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,920
long period of time, it tended
to forget where it started and

181
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,130
approached, diffused into this
uniform distribution.

182
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,860
OK.

183
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,470
I'd like to finish up here.

184
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,720
And I'll see you next time.

185
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,180
