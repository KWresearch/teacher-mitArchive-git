00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,790

00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,440
ANA RITA PIRES: In lecture,
you've learned about

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,610
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization,
and that's

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,600
what today's problem is about.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,790
We have a matrix A, and its
columns are a, b, and c.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,480
And I want you to find
orthonormal vectors q1, q2,

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,360
and q3 from those
three columns.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,280
Then I want you to
write A as a--

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,220
it's Q R decomposition where Q
is an orthogonal matrix, and R

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,270
is an upper triangular matrix.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,960
Remember, an orthogonal matrix
is a matrix whose columns are

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,480
orthonormal vectors.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,060
Work on it for a little while,
hit pause, and when you're

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,880
ready I'll come back and
we'll do it together.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:52,170

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,160
Did you manage to solve
that all right?

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,490
Well let's start solving
it together.

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,050
So Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization, as you

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,210
should remember from lecture,
consists of the following.

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,810
At each step you find you
orthonormal vector by taking

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,210
the vector that you started
with, a, b, or c in this case,

22
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:22,430
and making it orthonormal
to the previous ones.

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,780
Let's actually do it.

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,920
We want to find q1.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,710
Well to find q1, start with a,
and make it orthonormal to the

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,890
previous one.

27
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,020
There's no previous one,
so that's very easy.

28
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,670
The direction of a is fine and
you just need to ensure that

29
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,950
your vector has length 1.

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,790
Well a is the vector 1 0 0.

31
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,740
So you should divide it by its
length, but its length is 1,

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,240
so this is simply 1 0 0.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,280
q1 is done.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,530
Now let's do q2.

35
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,000

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,560
So with q2, I will start
with my vector b.

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,660
And then I want to make it, well
first of all, orthogonal

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,210
to what I already have,
which is q1.

39
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,070
For that I'm going to subtract
off from b the projection of b

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:21,970
onto q1 minus b dot
q1 times q1.

41
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,010
Usually, when you're doing the
projection of a vector onto

42
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,130
another vector, you have to
divide it by the length of, in

43
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,600
this case, q1.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,700
But because q1 has length 1,
you don't need to do that.

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,260
So what will it be here?

46
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,495
Well b dot q1 is going to be--

47
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:42,940

48
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:53,360
b is 2 0 3 minus b dot q1
will be 2, and 1 0 0.

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,870
So this will be 0 0 3.

50
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,360
This vector is orthogonal to
this one, and you can check by

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,440
doing your dot product.

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,250
It should be 0, and it is.

53
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,780
We need it also to be length 1,
because we want these two

54
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,920
vectors to be orthonormal.

55
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,810
So this is not actually q2.

56
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,900
Let's call this one q2 prime,
and set q2 equals to q2 prime

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:32,890
divided by its length, which
in this case is 3, 0 0 1.

58
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,140
That's my vector q2.

59
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,960
Let's go on to the
third one, q3.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,220
Well again, I start with
my third vector, c.

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,290
And then I want to subtract the
projection of c onto q1

62
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,640
and onto q2, and that will
give me a q3 that is

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,830
orthogonal to both q1 and q2.

64
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:09,270
c minus c dot q1 times q1
minus c dot q2 dot q2.

65
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:21,690
This will be c, 4 5 6 minus q1
was 1 0 0, so 4, times 1 0 0

66
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:28,590
minus q2, 6 0 0 1.

67
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:34,930
So this vector will be 0 5 0.

68
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,320
And once again, this one is
orthogonal to q1 and q2, but

69
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,270
it is not norm 1 yet.

70
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,610
So q3--

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,350
I'll call that one q3 prime--

72
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,390
and I'll set q3 equal to q3
prime divided by its length

73
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,770
which is 5.

74
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,480
q3 is the vector 0 1 0.

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,310

76
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,020
One thing that I want you to
note is that my vectors q1,

77
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,410
q2, q3 are very nice
in this case.

78
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,000
Usually, when you perform
Gram-Schmidt

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,930
orthogonalization, you end up
with lots of square roots

80
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,100
because you're dividing
by the length.

81
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,410
In this case, we have everything
is integers, which

82
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,550
is, well, very lucky.

83
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,440
Next part of the problem is
we want to write the Q R

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:37,110
decomposition of the matrix A.
A equals Q R. Well the matrix

85
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,660
A, you already know
what it is.

86
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:50,450
It is the matrix 1 2
4, 0 0 5, 0 3 6.

87
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,620
And q you want to be an
orthogonal matrix.

88
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,080
Like I said before, an
orthogonal matrix has

89
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,130
orthonormal vectors
for its columns.

90
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,590
And we already have
such a matrix.

91
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,150
It's the matrix that
has q1, q2, and q3

92
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,640
as its column vectors.

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:15,250
1 0 0, 0 0 1, and 0 1 0.

94
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,900
Now, we need an upper triangular
matrix that makes

95
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,450
this equality true.

96
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,400
Take a moment to look
at your matrix q.

97
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,130
It is simply a permutation
matrix, so it's very easy to

98
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,850
come up with a matrix that
should fit here.

99
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,520
What this permutation matrix
does is it exchanges rows two

100
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,635
and three from my matrix
R to give you A. So you

101
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:40,970
know what R must be.

102
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,980
It must be 1 2 4, 0 3 6--

103
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,910
that's the third row of A--

104
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,420
and then 0 0 5, which is
the second row of A.

105
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,420
And indeed, R is upper
triangular.

106
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,000
This is your Q R decomposition
of the matrix A. Q is

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
orthogonal, R is upper
triangular.

108
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,550
But let's see where these
numbers in the matrix R are

109
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,360
coming from.

110
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,990
Let me label these columns for
you, a b, c in q1, q2, q3.

111
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,385
And then I have my matrix R.

112
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,900
You know from the way that
matrix multiplication works

113
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:29,060
that A is going to be this
matrix Q times the first

114
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,340
column of R. So you can regard
that as these numbers in the

115
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,120
first column of R are giving you
the linear coefficients in

116
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,260
which you need to take these
vectors to add up to A. Let me

117
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,130
write that down.

118
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:49,310
A is going to be 1 times
q1 plus 0 times q2

119
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,980
plus 0 times q3.

120
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,380
Let's do it for b.

121
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,780
The second column of
this matrix will be

122
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,740
q times this column.

123
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:08,140
So it will be 2 times q1 plus
3 times q2 plus 0 times q3.

124
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,170
And finally, for c I will have
c is equal to this matrix

125
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:23,910
times this vector, 4q1
plus 6q2 plus 5q3.

126
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,060
Now let's go back and see
where these numbers are

127
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,310
showing up.

128
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,100

129
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,320
I wanted to have A equals
1 times q1.

130
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,340
Well that's very easy.

131
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,039
It comes from here, a
equals 1 times q1.

132
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,830

133
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,320
Let's try the second one.

134
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,640
b equals 2q1 plus 3q2.

135
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,650
Well q2, let's see.

136
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,570
q2 prime is equal to 3 times
q2, so let me write

137
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,430
this here to help.

138
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,900
3q2.

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,460
Now let me remind you that
b dot q1 was equal to 2.

140
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,600
Now look at this equation.

141
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,690
You we have b is equal
to 2q1 plus 3q2,

142
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,570
which is what we wanted.

143
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,820
Let's check q3.

144
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,720

145
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,450
q3 prime is equal to 5q3, so let
me write that here, 5q3.

146
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:33,150
And now I have c is equal to
this number was 4, and this

147
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,690
number was 6.

148
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:43,670
c is equal to 4q1 plus 6q2 plus
5q3, which indeed, is

149
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,250
what we wanted.

150
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,070
So this is where these numbers
from the matrix

151
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,780
R are coming from.

152
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,380
And that finishes
this problem.

153
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,210
I hope you have a better grasp
of the Q R decomposition now.

154
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:57,420
Bye.

155
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,670
See you next time.

156
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,913
