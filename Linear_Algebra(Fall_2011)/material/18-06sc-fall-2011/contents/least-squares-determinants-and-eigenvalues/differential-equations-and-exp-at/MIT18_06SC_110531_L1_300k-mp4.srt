LINAN CHEN: Hi.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,790
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,960
In the lecture, you've learned
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,170
of a matrix.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,450
One of the many important
applications of them is

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,880
solving a higher order linear
differential equation with

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,760
constant coefficients.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,390
A typical example is like
what I've written

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,340
on the board here.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,950
y is a function of p, and y and
its derivatives satisfy

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,510
this equation.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,950
As you can see, it involves y,
y prime, and all the way to

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,370
its third derivatives.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,000
So our first goal is to solve
this differential equation for

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,440
its general solution using
the method of matrix.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,790
So the very first thing that
we should do is to find out

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,640
which matrix we should
be working with.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,450
So after that, we also want
to say something about the

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,030
explanation of this matrix At.

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,570
We want to find out the first
column of this matrix

22
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,750
exponential.

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,940
Why don't you hit the pause
now, and try to write down

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,420
this matrix A by yourself.

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,620
But before you continue, make
sure you come back to this

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,210
video and check with me you've
got the correct A. I'll see

27
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,460
you in a while.

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:33,940

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,230
OK, let's work together to
transform this problem into

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,220
linear algebra.

31
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:53,650
The idea is to put y double
prime, y prime, and y together

32
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,560
as a vector.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,180
And let me call this vector u.

34
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:07,420
So of course, vector u is
also a function in t.

35
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,720
So this is vector u.

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,790
If this is u, what's going
to be u prime?

37
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,990
OK, u prime is going to be, so
I take derivative of every

38
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,600
coordinate here that's going to
be y triple prime, y double

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,170
prime, and y prime.

40
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,580
So this is our u prime t.

41
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,210

42
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:42,490
And my goal is to write u prime
as a matrix, call it A

43
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,710
times vector u itself.

44
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,090
So I want to put
a matrix here.

45
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,720

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,960
And I want to create this matrix
by incorporating this

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,170
differential equation.

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,900
If you move everything, except
y triple prime to the

49
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,600
right-hand side of the equation,
you can read y

50
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,860
triple prime is equal
to negative 2

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,640
times y double prime.

52
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,340
So y triple prime is negative
2 times y double

53
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,370
prime plus y prime.

54
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,550
That's plus 1 times
y prime plus 2y.

55
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,440
That's 2y, right?

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,770
That gives you the first row.

57
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,270
Then look at the second
coordinate,

58
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,970
this y double prime.

59
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,470
y double prime is
simply itself.

60
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,110
So you rate y double prime
is equal to 1, y double

61
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,650
prime then 0 0.

62
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,820
That's the second row.

63
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,520
Well same thing happens
to the last row. y

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,390
prime is again itself.

65
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:58,660
So that's 0 1 and 0.

66
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,680
That is our matrix A. Did you
get the right answer?

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,335
So we have transformed this
equation, this third other

68
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:13,210
ordinary differential equation
of y into a first other

69
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,540
differential equation of ut.

70
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,870
Although ut is a vector, but if
we can solve this equation

71
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,380
for u, we have all the
information we need for y.

72
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,490
So let's plan on solving
this equation.

73
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,210
In order to solve this equation,
we will need the

74
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,170
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
this matrix A. Again, this

75
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,930
is a good practice for you.

76
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,370
Why don't you possibly do again,
and try to complete

77
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,330
this problem on your own.

78
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,840
When you're ready, I'm going
to come back and show

79
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,090
you how I did it.

80
00:04:50,090 --> 00:05:01,170

81
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,520
Let's finish up everything
together.

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,540
So as we said, we need the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

83
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,810
of matrix A, and that involves
computing the determinant of

84
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,660
the following matrix.

85
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,540
So I want to compute the
determinant of A minus lambda

86
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,550
times the identity matrix I.

87
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,180
Let's write it out.

88
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:37,600
That's the determinant of -2
minus lambda 1 2, 1 negative

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,540
lambda 0, and 0 1
negative lambda.

90
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,850

91
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,290
So we need the determinant of
this three by three matrix.

92
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,220
Do it in your favorite way.

93
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,800
You can either use the big
summation formula, or you can

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,710
do by cofactor along any
row or any column.

95
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,400
The correct answer should be
this is equal to 1 minus

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,900
lambda times 1 plus lambda
times 2 plus lambda.

97
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,830

98
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,700
And this polynomial
has three roots.

99
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,790
1, -1, and negative -2.

100
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,380
These are the eigenvalues
we're looking for.

101
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,240
So let me write it here.

102
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,700
Lambda 1 is equal to 1.

103
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,990
Lambda 2 is equal to -1.

104
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:42,970
And lambda 3 is equal to -2.

105
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,220
So now what we need is the
eigenvector corresponding to

106
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,620
each eigenvalue.

107
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,820
Let's take lambda
1 for example.

108
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,130
The eigenvector of A
corresponding to lambda 1 is

109
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:02,560
in the null space of the matrix
A minus lambda 1I, so

110
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,380
in this case it's A minus I. So
it's in the null space of

111
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,870
this matrix.

112
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,270
In other words, we are looking
for a vector, let's call it a

113
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:20,090
b c, a column vector a b and
c, such that this matrix

114
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,560
multiplying a b c gives me 0.

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,890
So if you write it out that's
going to be A minus I is -3.

116
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:44,175
1, 2, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1 times
a b c is equal to 0.

117
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:46,990

118
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,460
OK.

119
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,950
Could we choose constants
a b c such that

120
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,360
this is always true?

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,660
Well if you read the last row,
so the last dot product, it

122
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,030
says that b has to
be equal to c.

123
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,440
And if you rate the second
row it says that a has

124
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,690
to be equal to b.

125
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,460

126
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,750
Which means a is equal
to b is equal to c.

127
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,870
And if this relation is true,
the first product is always

128
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,170
going to be 0.

129
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:29,190
So that simply means we can
choose the first eigenvector,

130
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:35,169
the eigenvector corresponding to
lambda 1, to be x1 is equal

131
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,100
to 1, 1, 1, transpose.

132
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,560
So we choose the first time
eigenvector to be the column

133
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,290
vector with all the coordinates
being 1.

134
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,370
And you can do the same thing
to lambda 2 and lambda 3.

135
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,600
But please allow me to skip
the computation here.

136
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,900
I'm going to write out
the answer for you.

137
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,680
So x2, the eigenvector
corresponding to the second

138
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:13,630
eigenvalue is going to be
equal to 1, -1, and 1.

139
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:23,190
And x3 is going to
be 4, -2, and 1.

140
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,070
Now we've got everything we need
in order to create the

141
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,130
general solutions for ut.

142
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,580
So we have eigenvalues, we
have the corresponding

143
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,720
eigenvectors.

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,660
What should be ut?

145
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:45,550
The general solution for ut is
equal to some constants, c1,

146
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,180
times e to the power
lambda 1t.

147
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,890
So in this case e
to the power t.

148
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,250
Then times the first
eigenvector, x1.

149
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,770
Plus some other constant
c2 times e to the

150
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,140
power lambda 2t.

151
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,750
So e to the power negative
t times x2.

152
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,840
That's the second eigenvector.

153
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,070
Then plus some other constant,
c3, times e to the

154
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,680
power lambda 3t.

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,190
So negative 2t times x3.

156
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,740
That gives you the general
solution for u.

157
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,840
As we just said, if you know
what u is, you have all the

158
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,030
information you need for y.

159
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,060
Just in case you're curious
about what y is, you can just

160
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,160
rate the last coordinate
of x1, x2, and x3.

161
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,920
And you can see that
all of them are 1.

162
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:57,986
So yt is simply equal to c1 e to
the power lambda t plus c2

163
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:06,290
e to the power negative t plus
c3 e to the power negative 2t.

164
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:12,300
And the choice of c1, c2, and
c3 is completely arbitrary.

165
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,030
So that completes the first
part of this question.

166
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,590
In the second part, we want
to say something about the

167
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,840
exponential of At.

168
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,250
So let me first give you the
recipe to cook up the

169
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,680
exponential of At.

170
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,090
The exponential of At
is equal to the

171
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,050
product of three matrices.

172
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:44,620
So you usually we denote them
by S times e to the power

173
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,140
capital lambda t
times S invert.

174
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,320
And you may ask what S is,
and what this matrix is.

175
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,930
So S is the matrix that has
x1, x2, and x3 being its

176
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,560
column vectors.

177
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:09,270
So S is x1, x2, and x3.

178
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,600
Let me copy it down here.

179
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,870
So that's 1, 1, 1, 1
-1, 1, 4, -2, 1.

180
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,460

181
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,870
And the matrix in the middle,
e to the power lambda t is a

182
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,610
diagonal matrix.

183
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,330
So e to the power lambda t, it's
a diagonal matrix, and

184
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,610
it's diagonal and trace are
given by e to the power lambda

185
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,030
1t, so that's e to the power t,
then e to the power lambda

186
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,330
2t negative t, and e to the
power lambda 3t makes it 2t.

187
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,490

188
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,190
0 everywhere else.

189
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,850
So that's e to the
power lambda t.

190
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,170
Then the exponential of this At
is given by the product of

191
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,490
these three matrices.

192
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,400
It looks a bit complicated
because it involves the

193
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,900
inverse of S. But luckily, we
only want the first column of

194
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,400
the result.

195
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:22,830
So if we consider this product,
we can see the

196
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,440
product of the first two
matrices is relatively easy,

197
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,550
because this is a diagonal
matrix, and we know that S is

198
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,730
given by these columns.

199
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,690
So the result of the product
of these two is simply

200
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,790
multiplying the columns of
S by these coefficients

201
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,220
respectively.

202
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,440
So you expect to get e to the
power lambda t, x1, times e to

203
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,840
the power--

204
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,230
sorry.

205
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,220
The second column should be e
to the power negative t, x2.

206
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,610
The third column should be e to
the power negative 2t, x3.

207
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,870

208
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,570
And here, what we should
put is S inverse.

209
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,130
But we don't need everything
from S inverse, because as we

210
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,480
just said, we only need the
first column of this result.

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,050
And the first column of this
product is going to be given

212
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,230
by linear combinations of
these columns, and the

213
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,910
coefficients are going
to be given by the

214
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,430
first column S inverse.

215
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,850
So our goal should be
just to get the

216
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,320
first column of S inverse.

217
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,290
Then what if the first
column of S inverse?

218
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,760
Well the formula for S inverse
is S inverse is going to be

219
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,100
the reciprocal of the
determinant of S, so 1 over

220
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:56,130
determinant of S times the
transpose of a matrix C. This

221
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,290
matrix C, the entries of this
matrix C are given by

222
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,660
cofactors of matrix S. And then
you take transpose, you

223
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,250
divide everything by the
determinant of S. The result

224
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,270
will be S inverse.

225
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,700
And we only need the first
column of this matrix.

226
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,220
Let's try to write the
first column out.

227
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,640
Well again, do it in your
favorite way to compute the

228
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,830
determinant of S. The result
should be 1 over 6.

229
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,650
So the determinant of S is 6.

230
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,080
Then what is the first column
of C transpose?

231
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,360
Well we can read it from here.

232
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,330
This spot, the 1, 1 spot,
should be the cofactor

233
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,560
of this spot here.

234
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,260
That make this 1, minus negative
2, which is 1, so we

235
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,510
put 1 here.

236
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,230

237
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:03,660
Now this spot will be the
cofactor of this entry here.

238
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,390
so that's 1 minus negative
2, that's 3.

239
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,330
But this is 12 entry,
so you should put a

240
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,700
negative sign in the front.

241
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,850

242
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,780
Then the last stop should be
the cofactor of this entry

243
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,520
here, which is 1 minus
negative 1, that's 2.

244
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,220

245
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,470
Something else here.

246
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,240

247
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,710
Two warnings.

248
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,700
First, don't forget this
transpose sign.

249
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,430
Second, don't forget
this negative sign.

250
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,610
We've got the first column
of S inverse, and

251
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,320
that's all we need.

252
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,720
So we put it here.

253
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,780
That's 1 over 6, -1/2 and 1/3.

254
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,750

255
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,210
That's good enough for me.

256
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,700
Now I can write up the first
column of exponential of At.

257
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,440
So the first column of the
exponential of At, I'm going

258
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,060
to write it here.

259
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,819
That's going to be equal to
the linear combination of

260
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,990
these columns.

261
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,280
So that's 1/6 of the first
column, that's e to the power

262
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,580
t over 6 times x1.

263
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,350
Plus this times this, so that's
going to be minus 1/2

264
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,040
of e to the power negative
t times x2.

265
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:50,660
The plus 1/3 of e to the power
negative 2t times x3.

266
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,940
That's the first column
of the exponential At.

267
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,980
And then with the other
two columns.

268
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,750

269
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,520
That's the answer.

270
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,740
If you want more practice, you
can certainly complete this S

271
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,020
inverse, and then you can
also complete the

272
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,280
exponential of At.

273
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,360
But I will leave the
rest to you.

274
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,150
OK, I hope this example shows
you that linear algebra can be

275
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,600
a powerful tool in solving
higher order ordinary

276
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,890
differential equations with
constant coefficients.

277
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,110
And we have demonstrated the
standard procedure to do it,

278
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,030
and we also practiced
how to calculate the

279
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,140
exponential of a matrix.

280
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,350
Thanks for watching, and
see you next time.

281
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,640
