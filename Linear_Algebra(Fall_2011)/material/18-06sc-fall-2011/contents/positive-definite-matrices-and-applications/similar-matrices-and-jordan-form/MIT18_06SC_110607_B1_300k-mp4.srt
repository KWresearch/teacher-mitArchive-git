00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:07,090
BEN HARRIS: Hi.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,310
Today we're going
to do a problem

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,250
about similar matrices.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,440
The problem is right here.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,059
So the question asks, which of
the following statements are

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,670
true, and it asks you
to explain why.

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,850
The first statement is if A and
B are similar matrices,

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,760
then 2A cubed plus A minus 3
times the identity is similar

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,350
to 2 times B cubed plus B minus
3 times the identity.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,290
The second question asks if A
and B are 3 by 3 matrices with

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,780
eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1,
then they're similar.

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,070
And the third part asks you
whether these two j matrices

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,460
are similar.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,160
OK.

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,700
I'll give you a moment to hit
pause and try it on your own.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,475
I'll be back in just a moment,
and we can do it together.

18
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:09,300

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,550
And we're back.

20
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,560

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,230
Let's start with part a.

22
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,810

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,280
Part a is true.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,130

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,620
Why?

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,490
Well, what does it mean for
A and B to be similar?

27
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,810
Right, we know there's some
matrix M, such that-- that's

28
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,660
what st means--

29
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,260
when I multiply A on the left
by M and the right by M

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,320
inverse,

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,560
I get B. OK.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,080
So let's take that same matrix
M and multiply it on the left

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,075
and the right of 2A cubed plus
A minus 3 times the identity.

34
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:05,830

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,630
OK.

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,720
What do we get here?

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,190
Well, the point is when A times
A cubed times m inverse,

38
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,515
we can just write that
as 3 MAM inverses.

39
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:24,190

40
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:33,070
Similarly, we have an MAM
inverse and an M times the

41
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,980
identity times m inverse.

42
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,270
Good.

43
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,920
Remember that M times A times M
inverse is B. So we just get

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:49,800
2B cubed, 3B plus B minus--

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,010
well, M times the identity is
just M. So we just get the

46
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,872
identity back, and we have
3 times the identity.

47
00:02:57,872 --> 00:02:58,760
Good.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,280
And this is a general remark,
that if you have matrices A

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,910
and B that are similar, then
any polynomials in these

50
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,080
matrices A and B will
be similar.

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,090
It's the exact same
justification.

52
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,360
OK.

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,930
Now let's go on to part B. So
now A and B are 3 by 3 similar

54
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,160
matrices with the same
eigenvalues.

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,690
And their eigenvalues
are distinct.

56
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,085
So it turns out that
b is true, as well.

57
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:35,830

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,940
And why is that?

59
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,020
A matrix with distinct
eigenvalues is diagonalizable.

60
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:53,950
So we can write A as S, lambda,
S inverse, where

61
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,982
lambda is just this
eigenvalue matrix.

62
00:03:57,982 --> 00:04:00,550

63
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,870
We can also write B as T,
lambda, T inverse, where

64
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,500
lambda is the same in both cases
because they have the

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,420
same eigenvalues.

66
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,310
Good.

67
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,040
Now I'll let you--

68
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,560
so before we check it, let's
just say the point.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,440
The point is if two matrices
are similar to the same

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,950
matrix, then they're similar
to each other.

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,100
Similarity is a transitive
relation.

72
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:40,140
And I'll just let you check that
you can take TS inverse A

73
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:48,970
times TS inverse inverse, and
you'll get B. This falls

74
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,690
directly from these
two relations.

75
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,130
Good.

76
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,185
Now let's take on part
C. Part C is false.

77
00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:01,240

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,580
Let's come back over here
and look at these two

79
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,310
matrices, J1 and J2.

80
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,750
The first thing you should
see is that these

81
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,000
two are Jordan blocks--

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,580

83
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,600
they're not Jordan blocks,
they're matrices in Jordan

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
normal form.

85
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,530
They're different matrices in
Jordan normal form, so they

86
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,350
will not be similar.

87
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,060
But let's actually see why.

88
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,400
Let's look at--

89
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,770
remember one of the things that
similarity preserves are

90
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,790
eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

91
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,810
So let's look at the eigenspace
with eigenvalue

92
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,710
minus one with these
two matrices.

93
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,010
So J1 plus the identity--

94
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,720
let's look at the nullspace
of this matrix.

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:59,730
So this is just 0's on the
diagonal and 1's right above

96
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:05,530
the diagonal, and J2
plus the identity.

97
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,790
This is just 0, 1, 0, 0.

98
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,350

99
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:20,550
So the point is that the
nullspace of this matrix is

100
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,050
just one dimensional.

101
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,570
So there's only one independent
eigenvector of J1

102
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,880
with eigenvalue minus 1 whereas
the nullspace of this

103
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,900
matrix is two dimensional.

104
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,550

105
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,230
There are two independent
eigenvectors with

106
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,130
eigenvalue minus 1.

107
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,520
So the dimension--

108
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,170
the nullspace--

109
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:54,650
of J1 plus the identity, this
is 1, and this is 2.

110
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,880
So they cannot possibly
be similar.

111
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,890

112
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,200
Good.

113
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,820
So that completes the problem.

114
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,030
It's a nice exercise to do
this more generally.

115
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,910
And you can use these techniques
not just looking at

116
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,020
the number of independent
eigenvectors and the nullspace

117
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,410
of your J minus lambda I matrix,
but also powers of J

118
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,710
minus lambda I and
their nullspaces.

119
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,660
You can use this to show that
any two matrices in Jordan

120
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,500
normal form that are different
are not similar.

121
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,770
This same method works.

122
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,650
And that's a nice exercise if
you want to go a little

123
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,340
further with similar matrices.

124
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,530
Let's just recap the properties
we saw here.

125
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,500
We saw that if we had two
similar matrices, then any

126
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,840
polynomials in those matrices
were similar.

127
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,040
And we saw that if we have two
matrices that have the same

128
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,030
distinct eigenvalues, then
they're similar.

129
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,330
And we saw that, in a special
case, we saw that two matrices

130
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,360
in Jordan normal form that are
different are not similar.

131
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,610
Thanks.

132
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,778
