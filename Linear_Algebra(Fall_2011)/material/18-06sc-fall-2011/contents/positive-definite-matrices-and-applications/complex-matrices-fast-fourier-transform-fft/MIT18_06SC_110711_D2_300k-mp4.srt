DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,280
Welcome back.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,940
So today we're going to tackle a
problem in complex matrices.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,080
And specifically, we're going
to look at diagonalizing a

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,280
complex matrix.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,670
So given this matrix A, we're
asked to find its eigenvalue

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,150
matrix lambda, and its
eigenvector matrix S.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,120
And one thing to note about this
matrix A is that if we

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,310
take its conjugate transpose,
it's actually equal to itself.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,000
So in Professor Strang's book,
he combines this notation to

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,150
be superscript H to mean
conjugate transpose.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,050
So if you were to take the
transpose of this matrix and

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,490
then conjugate all the elements,
you would find that

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,050
A equals its conjugate
transpose, and we call this

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,880
property Hermitian.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,810
So I'll let you think about this
for a moment and I'll be

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,060
back in a second.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:01:03,360

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,120
OK, welcome back.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,590
So what's the first step in
computing the eigenvectors and

22
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,610
eigenvalues of the matrix
is to take a look at the

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,670
characteristic equation.

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,790
So specifically, we take det
of A minus lambda i.

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,830

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,390
And quite possibly, the only
thing new with this problem is

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,130
that the entries of the
matrix A are complex.

28
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,370
Now, you may have already seen
that lambda's being complex,

29
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,760
but we're going to work
this out explicitly.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,640
So if I take the determinant, we
get det of 2 minus lambda,

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,000
3 minus lambda, we have
1 minus i, 1 plus i.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,720

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,970
We want to set this to 0.

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,680

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,455
This then gives us a polynomial
for lambda.

36
00:01:55,455 --> 00:02:02,630

37
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:09,460
1 plus i, 1 minus i,
set it equal to 0.

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,869
We can expand out this term.

39
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:15,980
You get 6 minus 5 lambda
plus lambda squared.

40
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,150

41
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,110
These two terms you'll
note are complex

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,520
conjugates of each other.

43
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,900
This tends to make
things simple.

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,610
So we have minus 1 minus i
squared is going to give us 2.

45
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,370
Because they're differences of
squares, the cross terms

46
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,470
involving i cancel, and we get
the characteristic equation.

47
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,570

48
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,540
Lambda squared minus 5 lambda
plus 4 equals 0.

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,300
And specifically, we can
factorize this equation.

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,530

51
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:01,700
We see that there's roots of
minus 1, or factorizes into

52
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,140
factors of lambda -1 and lambda
-4, which then give us

53
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,390
roots of lambda is 1
and lambda is 4.

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,800
So when one curious point to
note is that the eigenvalues

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,590
are real in this case.

56
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,230
1 and 4 are real, whereas the
matrix that we started with

57
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,430
was complex.

58
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,720
And this is a general property
of Hermitian matrices.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,410
So even though they might be
complex matrices, Hermitian

60
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,290
matrices always have
real eigenvalues.

61
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,650
So this is the first step when
asked to diagonalize a matrix.

62
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,030
The second step is to find
the eigenvectors.

63
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:45,370

64
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,740
And to do that what we have to
do is we have to look at the

65
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,770
cases for lambda equals 1 and
lambda is equal 4 separately.

66
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,910
So let's first look at the case
of lambda is equal to 1.

67
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,960

68
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,630
And specifically, we're going
to be looking for a vector

69
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:13,210
such that A minus lambda i
times the vector v is 0.

70
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,959
And if we've done things
properly, this matrix A minus

71
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,720
lambda i should be singular.

72
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,640
So if we take A minus lambda
i, we're going to get 1 1

73
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:32,290
minus i, 1 plus i
3 minus 1 is 2.

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,410
And I'll write out components
of v, which are v1 and v2.

75
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,290
And we want this to be 0.

76
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,900
And you'll note that it's almost
always the case that

77
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,260
when we work out A minus lambda
i, the second row is

78
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,050
going to be a constant multiple
of the first row.

79
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,090
And this must be the case
because these two rows must be

80
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,710
linearly dependent on each other
for the matrix A minus

81
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,860
lambda i to be singular.

82
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,360
So if you look at this you might
think that these two

83
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,720
rows aren't necessarily
linearly independent.

84
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,740
But the point is that there's
complex numbers involved.

85
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,140
And indeed, actually if we were
to multiply this first

86
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,990
row by 1 plus lambda, we would
get 1 plus lambda and 2.

87
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,940
And you note that that's
exactly the second row.

88
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,380
So this second row is actually
1 plus lambda

89
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,880
times the first row.

90
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,550
So these rows are actually
linearly

91
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,140
dependent on each other.

92
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,820
So what values of v1
and v2 can we take?

93
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,930
Well we just need to make this
top row multiplied by v1 and

94
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,350
v2 equal to 0.

95
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,660
And then because the second row
is a constant multiple of

96
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,630
the first row, we're
automatically guaranteed that

97
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,880
the second equation holds.

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,790

99
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:50,780
So just by looking at it, I'm
going to take v1 is equal to 1

100
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,260
minus i, and v2 is negative 1.

101
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,440
So we see that 1 times 1 minus
i minus 1 times 1 minus i is

102
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,810
going to give us 0.

103
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,420
So this is one solution.

104
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,810
And of course, we can take any
constant multiple times this

105
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,690
eigenvector, and that's also
going to be an eigenvector.

106
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,810

107
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,610
So I'll just write this out.

108
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,740
1 minus i, minus 1 is the
eigenvector for lambda is

109
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,640
equal to 1.

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,520
For lambda is equal to 4, again,
A minus lambda i, is

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:38,220
going to give us negative 2, 1
minus i, 1 plus i, 3 minus

112
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,440
lambda's going to be minus 1.

113
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,590
And I'll call this
vector u1 and u2.

114
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,400

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,230
And again, we want u1
and u2 equal to 0--

116
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,450
or sorry, the matrix
multiplied by u1,

117
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,880
u2 is equal to 0.

118
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,960
And just by looking at this
again, we see that the second

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,440
row is actually a constant
multiple of the first row.

120
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,210
For example, if we were to
multiply this row by negative

121
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,490
2, and this row by 1 plus i,
we would see that they're

122
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,790
constant multiples
of each other.

123
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:22,110
So I can take u to be, for
example, 1, and 1 plus i.

124
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,770
How did I get this?

125
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,090
Well I just looked at the second
equation because it's a

126
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,360
little simpler, and I said well
if I have 1 plus I here,

127
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,470
I can just say multiply
it by 1.

128
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,360
And then minus 1 times 1
plus I when I add them

129
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,380
up is going to vanish.

130
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,880
So this is how I get
the second one.

131
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,590
Now there's something curious
going on, and this is going to

132
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,740
be another property of
Hermitian matrices.

133
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,700
But if you actually take a look
at this eigenvector, it

134
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,210
will be orthogonal to this
eigenvector when we conjugate

135
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,620
the elements and dot the
two vectors together.

136
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,180
So this is another very special
property of complex

137
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,430
Hermitian matrices.

138
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,550

139
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,420
OK, so the last step now is to
construct these matrices

140
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,940
lambda and S. Now we already
know what lambda is because

141
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,580
it's the diagonal matrix with
the eigenvalues 1 and 4.

142
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,620
So we have 1 0, 0 and 4.

143
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,860

144
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,370
Now I'm going to do something
special for S. I've noted that

145
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,210
these two vectors u and v are
orthogonal to each other.

146
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,169
So what do I mean
by orthogonal?

147
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,120
Specifically, if I were to take
v conjugate transpose and

148
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:45,370
multiply it by u, we would end
up getting 1 plus i minus 1.

149
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,210
This would be v conjugate
transpose.

150
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,890
1, 1 plus i, and we see
that when we multiply

151
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,580
these out we get 0.

152
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,460

153
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,950
So when we have orthogonal
eigenvectors, there's a trick

154
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,150
that we can do to build up this
matrix S and S inverse.

155
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,710
What we can do is we can
normalize u and v. So

156
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,210
specifically, we can take any
constant multiple of u and v,

157
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,920
and it's still going to
be an eigenvector.

158
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,150
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take u and v and

159
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,020
multiply them by their length.

160
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,420
So for example u, the
amplitude of its top

161
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
component is 1.

162
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,310
The amplitude of its bottom
component is 2.

163
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,020
So notice that the modulus
of the complex

164
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,430
number 1 plus I is 2.

165
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,690
So we have--

166
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,480

167
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,680
sorry, it's root 2, the complex
modulus is root 2.

168
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,990
So the amplitude of the entire
vector is root 3.

169
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,530
It's 1 plus 2 squared quantity
squared rooted,

170
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,150
so it's root 3.

171
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,140
So what we can do is we can
build up this matrix S using a

172
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,220
normalization factor
of 1 over root 3.

173
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,020

174
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,340
And I'm going to take the first
column is the first

175
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,980
eigenvector that corresponds
to eigenvalue 1.

176
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,120
And then the second column is
the second eigenvector which

177
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,870
corresponds value 4.

178
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,310
And the reason I put in this
root 3 here is to make this

179
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,280
column unit length 1, and this
column unit length 1.

180
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:38,440
And the reason I do this is
because now this matrix S,

181
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,560
it's possible to check that
this matrix S is actually

182
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,330
unitary, which means that its
inverse is actually just equal

183
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,690
to it's conjugate transpose.

184
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,100
So this is a very special
property of the eigenvectors

185
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,350
of a Hermitian matrix.

186
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,370

187
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,850
And then lastly, I'm just
going to write down the

188
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,290
diagonalization of A. So if I
have A, because I have its

189
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,550
eigenvector matrix S, and its
eigenvalue matrix lambda, it's

190
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,350
possible to decompose
A into a product

191
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,730
of S lambda, S inverse.

192
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:27,010
And because S is unitary, its
inverse is actually its

193
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,940
conjugate transpose.

194
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,120
So just to put the pieces
together, we have A is equal

195
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,285
to S, which is 1 over root 3.

196
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:40,410

197
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:47,850
1 minus i, minus 1, 1, 1 plus i
times the diagonal matrix 1

198
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:54,560
0, 0 4 times S inverse,
which is going to be

199
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,850
its conjugate transpose.

200
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,850
So what I do is I conjugate
each element, so 1 minus i

201
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,320
becomes 1 plus i
and vice versa.

202
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,530
And then I take the transpose.

203
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,420
So I get 1 plus i.

204
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,970
Transposing swaps the
minus 1 and 1.

205
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,090

206
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,300
And at the end of the day, I
get S inverse is just this

207
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,120
matrix here.

208
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,070
And if you were to multiply
these matrices out, you would

209
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,660
see it you actually
do recover A.

210
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,230
So just to summarize quickly,
even though we were given a

211
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,300
complex matrix A, the process
to diagonalize A is the same

212
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,580
as what we've seen before.

213
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,840
The first step is to find the
characteristic equation and

214
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,950
the eigenvalues.

215
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,590
And then the second step is to
find the eigenvectors, and you

216
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,580
do this in the same procedure.

217
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,150
But in general, the eigenvectors
can be complex.

218
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,780
And for this very special case,
when A is Hermitian, the

219
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,260
eigenvalues are real, and the
eigenvectors are orthogonal to

220
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,750
each other.

221
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,990
So I think I'll conclude here,
and I'll see you next time.

222
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,120
