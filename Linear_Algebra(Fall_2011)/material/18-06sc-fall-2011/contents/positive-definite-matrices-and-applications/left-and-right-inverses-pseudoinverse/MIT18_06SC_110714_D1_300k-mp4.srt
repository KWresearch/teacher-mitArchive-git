DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,950
Welcome back.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,370
So today I'd like to tackle a
problem on pseudoinverses.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,490
So given a matrix A, which
is not square, so

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,560
it's just 1 and 2.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,640
First, what is its
pseudoinverse?

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,300
So A plus I'm using to denote
the pseudoinverse.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,460
Then secondly, compute A
plus A and A A plus.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,530
And then thirdly, if x is in the
null space of A, what is A

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,070
plus A acting on x?

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,540
And lastly, if x is in the
column space of A transpose,

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,280
what is A plus Ax?

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,310
So I'll let you think about this
problem for a bit, and

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,560
I'll be back in a second.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:59,942

17
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,040
Hi everyone.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,540
Welcome back.

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,209
OK, so let's take a look
at this problem.

20
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,030
Now first off, what is
a pseudoinverse?

21
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,690
Well we define the pseudoinverse
using the SVD.

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,940

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,160
So in actuality, this
is nothing new.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,220

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,910
Now, we note that because A
is not square, the regular

26
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,180
inverse of A doesn't necessarily
exist. However, we

27
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,730
do know that the SVD exists
for every matrix A whether

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,980
it's square or not.

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,170
So how do we compute the
SVD of a matrix?

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,040
Well let's just recall that the
SVD of a matrix has the

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:54,430
form of u sigma V transpose
where u and V

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,510
are orthogonal matrices.

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,510
And sigma is a matrix with
positive values along the

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,810
diagonal or 0s along
the diagonal.

35
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,070
And let's just take a look at
the dimensions of these

36
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,020
matrices for a second.

37
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,860
So we know that A is
a 1 by 2 matrix.

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,570
And the way to figure out what
the dimensions of these

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,830
matrices are I usually always
start with the center matrix,

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,740
sigma, and sigma is always
going to have the same

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,230
dimensions as A, so it's going
to be a 1 by 2 matrix.

42
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,140
u and V are always
square matrices.

43
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,190
So to make this multiplication
work out, we need V to have 2,

44
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,220
and because it's square
it has to be 2 by 2.

45
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,250
And likewise, u has
to be 1 by 1.

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,930
So we now have the dimensions
of u sigma and V. And note,

47
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,990
because u is a 1 by 1 matrix,
the only orthogonal 1 by 1

48
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,790
matrix is just 1.

49
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:59,360
So u we already know is just
going to be the matrix, the

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,870
identity matrix, which
is a 1 by 1 matrix.

51
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,750
OK, now how do we compute
V and sigma?

52
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:14,670
Well we can take A transpose
and A, and if we do that we

53
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,070
end up getting the
matrix V sigma

54
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:27,220
transpose sigma, V transpose.

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,810
And this matrix is going to be
a square matrix where the

56
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,300
diagonal elements are squares
of the singular values.

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,650
So computing V and the values
along sigma, just boil down to

58
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,520
diagonalizing A transpose A.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,960
So what is A transpose A?

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:59,340
Well in our case is 1 2 times 1
2, which gives us 1 2, 2 4.

61
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,940
And note that the second row
is just a constant multiple

62
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,770
times the first row.

63
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,360
Now what this means is we
have a zero eigenvalue.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,470
So we already know that lambda
1 is going to be 0.

65
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,540
So one of the eigenvalues
of this matrix is 0.

66
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,730
And of course, when we square
root it, this is going to give

67
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,350
us a singular value sigma,
which is also 0.

68
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,820
And this is generally a case
when we have a sigma which is

69
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,940
not square.

70
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,320
We typically always have
0 singular values.

71
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,340
Now to compute the second
eigenvalue, well we already

72
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,250
know how to compute the
eigenvalues of a matrix, so

73
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,770
I'm just going to tell
you what it is.

74
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,430
The second one is lambda is 5.

75
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,570
And if we just take a quick look
what the corresponding

76
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:59,130
eigenvector is going to be to
lambda is 5, it's going to

77
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,380
satisfy this equation.

78
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,900

79
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,170
So we can take the eigenvector
u to be 1 and 2.

80
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,620
However, remember that when we
compute the eigenvector for

81
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,120
this orthogonal matrix
V, they always have

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,880
to have a unit length.

83
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,050
And this vector right now
doesn't have a unit length.

84
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,200
We have to divide by the length
of this vector, which

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,750
in our case is 1 over root 5.

86
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,960
And if I go back to the lambda
equals 0 case, we also have

87
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,440
another eigenvector, which
I'll just state.

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,420
You can actually compute it
quite quickly just by noting

89
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,110
that it has to be orthogonal to
this eigenvector, 2 and 1.

90
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,870

91
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,730
So what this means is A has a
singular value decomposition,

92
00:05:52,730 --> 00:06:01,940
which looks like 1, so this is
u, times sigma, which is going

93
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,250
to be root 5 0.

94
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,600
Remember that the first sigma is
actually the square root of

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,850
the eigenvalue.

96
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,740

97
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,110
Times a matrix which looks like,
now we have to order the

98
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,460
eigenvalues up in the
correct order.

99
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,830
Because 5 appears in the first
column, we have to take this

100
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,430
vector to be in the first
column as well.

101
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:34,170
So this is 1 over root 5, this
is 2 over root 5, negative 2

102
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,050
over root 5, and
1 over root 5.

103
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:48,670
And now this is V, but the
singular value decomposition

104
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,940
is defined by V transpose.

105
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,120

106
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
So this gives us a
representation for A. And now

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,720
once we have the SVD of A, how
do we actually compute A plus,

108
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,110
or the pseudoinverse of A?

109
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:15,810
Well just note if A was
invertible, then the inverse

110
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:25,440
of A in terms of the SVD would
be V transpose times the

111
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,690
inverse of sigma.

112
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,800

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,020
Sorry, this is not V transpose,
this is just V. So

114
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,095
it'd be V sigma inverse
u transpose.

115
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:39,120

116
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,400
And when A is invertible,
sigma inverse exists.

117
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,200
So in our case, sigma inverse
doesn't necessarily exist

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:57,290
because sigma, note this is
sigma, sigma is root 5 and 0.

119
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,970
So we have to construct a
pseudoinverse for sigma.

120
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,210
So the way that we do that is
we take 1 over each singular

121
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,790
value, and we take the
transpose of sigma.

122
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,850

123
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,280
So when A is not invertible,
we can still construct a

124
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,550
pseudoinverse by taking V sigma
and approximation for

125
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,330
sigma inverse, which in our case
is going to be 1 over the

126
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,480
singular value and 0.

127
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,289
So note where sigma is
invertible, we take the

128
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,700
inverse, and then we fill
in 0s in the other

129
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,234
areas, times u transpose.

130
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:46,500

131
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,920
And we can work this out.

132
00:08:47,920 --> 00:09:01,880
We get 1 over root 5, 1 minus
2, 2 1, 1 over root 5, 0.

133
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,760

134
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:18,380
And if I multiply things
out, I get 1/5, 1 2.

135
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,970
So this is an approximation for
A inverse, which is the

136
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,270
pseudoinverse.

137
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,290
So this finishes up part one.

138
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,970
And I'll started on part
two in a second.

139
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:35,780

140
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,230
So now that we've just computed
the pseudoinverse of

141
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,050
A. We're going to investigate
some properties of the

142
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,620
pseudoinverse.

143
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,530
So for part two we need to
compute A times A plus and A

144
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:56,150
plus times A. So we can just
go ahead and do this.

145
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:04,590
So A A plus you can
do fairly quickly.

146
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,000
1/5, 1 2.

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
And when we multiply it
out we get 1 plus 4

148
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,720
divided by 5 is 1.

149
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,750
So we just get the one by one
matrix, which is 1, the

150
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,860
identity matrix.

151
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,640
And secondly, if we take A plus
times A we're going to

152
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:37,930
get 1/5, 1 2 times 1 2.

153
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,640
And we can just fill
in this matrix.

154
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,335
This is 1/5, 1 2, 2 1.

155
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:52,070

156
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,330
And this concludes part two.

157
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,200
So now let's take a look at what
happens when a vector x

158
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,080
is in the null space of A, and
then secondly, what happens

159
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,280
when x is in the column
space of A transpose.

160
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,790
So for part three, let's assume
x is in the null space

161
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,590
of A. Well what's the
null space of A?

162
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:20,310
We can quickly check that the
null space of A is a constant

163
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,730
times any vector minus 2 1.

164
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,270
So that's the null space.

165
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,980
So if x is, for example, i.e.

166
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:39,530
if we take x is equal to minus
2 1, and we were to, say,

167
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:48,880
multiply it by A plus
A, acting on x we

168
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,840
see that we get 0.

169
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,110
And this isn't very surprising
because, well if x is in the

170
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,180
null space of A, we know
that A acting on x

171
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,430
is going to be 0.

172
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,920

173
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,390
So that no matter what matrix A
plus is, when we multiply by

174
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,320
0, we'll always end up with 0.

175
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,740

176
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,970
And then lastly, let's
take a look at the

177
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,220
column space of A transpose.

178
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,640

179
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,410
Well A transpose is 1 2, so it's
any constant times the

180
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,660
vector 1 2.

181
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,880

182
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,720
And specifically, if we were to
take, say, x is equal to 1

183
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,920
2, we can work at A plus A
acting on the vector 1 2.

184
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,070

185
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:56,000
So we have 1/5, 1 2, 2 1.

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,490
So recall this is A plus A. And
if we multiply it on the

187
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:11,980
vector 1 2, we get 1 plus 4 is
5 divided by 5, so we get 1.

188
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,690
2 plus 2 is 4--

189
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,310

190
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,610
sorry, I copied the
matrix down.

191
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:30,920
So it's 2 plus 8, which is
10 divided by 5 is 2.

192
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,030
And we see that at the end
we recover the vector x.

193
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,170

194
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:43,410
So in general, if we take A plus
A acting on x, where x is

195
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,840
in the column space of A
transpose, we always recover x

196
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,940
at the end of the day.

197
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,520
So intuitively, what does
this matrix A plus A do?

198
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:02,410
Well if x is in the null space
of A, it just kills it.

199
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,770
We just get 0.

200
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,710
If x is not in the null space of
A, then we just get x back.

201
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,740
So it's essentially the identity
matrix acting on x

202
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,520
whenever x is in the column
space of A transpose.

203
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,180
Now specifically, if A is
invertible, then A doesn't

204
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,490
have a null space.

205
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,590
So what that means is when
A is invertible, A plus A

206
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,540
recovers the identity because
when we multiply it on any

207
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,540
vector, we get that
vector back.

208
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,790
So I'd like to conclude here,
and I'll see you next time.

209
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,552
