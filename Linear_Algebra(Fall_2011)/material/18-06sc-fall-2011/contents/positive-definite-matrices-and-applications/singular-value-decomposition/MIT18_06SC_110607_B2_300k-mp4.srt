1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,060
PROFESSOR: Hey, we're back.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,070
Today we're going to
do a singular value

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,510
decomposition question.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,660
The problem is really simple
to state, find the singular

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:25,150
value decomposition of this
matrix c equals 5, 5, -1, 7.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,800
Hit pause, try it yourself, I'll
be back in a minute and

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,050
we can do it together.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:40,360

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,400
All right we're back, now
let's do it together.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,550
Now, I know Professor Strang has
done a couple of these in

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,520
lecture, but as he pointed out
there, it's really easy to

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,550
make a mistake, so you can never
do enough examples of

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,460
finding the SVD.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,690
So, what does the
SVD look like?

16
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,190
What do we want to
end up with?

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:16,620
Well, we want a decomposition c
equals u sigma v transpose.

18
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,980
u and v are going to be
orthogonal matrices, that is,

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,690
their columns are orthonormal
sets.

20
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,230
Sigma is going to be a
diagonal matrix with

21
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,690
non-negative entries.

22
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,930
OK, good, so, now how do we
find this decomposition?

23
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,640
Well, we need two
equations, OK?

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:52,070
One is c transpose c is equal to
v, sigma transpose, sigma,

25
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,260
v transpose.

26
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,830
And you get this just by
plugging in c transpose c here

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,150
I'm noticing that u transpose
u is 1, since you as an

28
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,752
orthogonal matrix.

29
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:07,710
Okay, and the second equation
is just noticing that v

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,410
transposes v inverse, and moving
it to the other side of

31
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,930
the equation, which is
c v equals u sigma.

32
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,970
OK, so these are the two
equations we need to use to

33
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,370
find v, sigma, and u.

34
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,040
OK, so let's start with
the first one.

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,880
Let's compute c transpose c.

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,535
So c transpose c is that--

37
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:44,909

38
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:52,300
Well if you compute we'll
get a 26, an 18, an

39
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:00,300
18, and a 74, great.

40
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,690
Now what you notice about this
equation is this is just a

41
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,470
diagonalization of
c transpose c.

42
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,070
So we need to find the
eigenvalues, those will be the

43
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,640
entries of sigma transpose
sigma, and the eigenvectors

44
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,910
which will be the columns
of a v. Okay, good.

45
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,490

46
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,810
So how do we find those?

47
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,350
Well, we look at the determinant
of c transpose c

48
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,300
minus lambda times the identity,
which is the

49
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:47,100
determinant of 26 minus lambda,
18, 18, and 74--

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:55,520
74 minus lambda, thank you.

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,860
Good, OK, and what is
that polynomial?

52
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,650
Well, we get a lambda squared,
now the 26 plus 74 is 100, so

53
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,130
you get minus 100 lambda.

54
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,020
And I'll let you do 26 times
74 minus 18 squared on your

55
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:22,100
own, but you'll see you get
1,600, and this easily factors

56
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,880
is lambda minus 20 times
lambda minus 80.

57
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,550
So the eigenvalues
are 20 and 80.

58
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,150
Now what are the eigenvectors?

59
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,850
Well, you take c transpose c,
minus 20 times the identity,

60
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:50,400
and you get 6, 18, 18 and 54.

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,880
To find the eigenvector with
eigenvalue 20 we need to find

62
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,940
a vector in the null space
of this matrix.

63
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,710
Note that the second column is
three times the first column,

64
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,750
so our first vector, v1, we
can just take that to be,

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:17,450
well, we could take it to be -3,
1, but we'd like it to be

66
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,040
a unit vector, right?

67
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,210
Remember the columns of v should
be unit vectors because

68
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,600
they're orthonormal.

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,590
So 3 squared plus 1 squared is
10, we have to divide by the

70
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,260
square root of 10.

71
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:41,420
OK, similarly, we do c transpose
c minus 80 times the

72
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:56,570
identity, we'll get -54, 18, 18,
and -6, and similarly we

73
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:05,650
can find that v2 will be 1 over
square root of 10, 3 over

74
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,360
the square root of 10.

75
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,550
Great, OK, so what information
do we have now?

76
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,070
we have our v matrix which is
just made up of these two

77
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,480
columns, and we actually have
our signal matrix too, because

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,170
the squares of the diagonal
entries of

79
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,250
sigma are 20 and 80.

80
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:33,800
Good, so let's write those down,
what we have. So we have

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,340
v, I just add these vectors
and make them the

82
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,120
columns of my matrix.

83
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,860
Square root of 10, 1 over square
root of 10, 1 over

84
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:59,430
square root of 10, 3 over square
root of 10, and sigma,

85
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,000
this is just the square roots of
20 and 80, which is just 2

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,085
root 5 and 4 root 5 along
the diagonal.

87
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:11,200

88
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,500
Squeezing it in here, I hope
you all can see these two.

89
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,104

90
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:21,830
Good, so these are two of the
three parts of my singular

91
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,940
value decomposition.

92
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,190
The last thing I need to find
is u, and for that I need to

93
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,600
use this second equation
right here.

94
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:41,240
So you need to multiply c times
v, okay, so c is 5, 5,

95
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:52,900
-1, 7, let's multiply it by v,
1 over root 10, 3 over square

96
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,380
root of 10.

97
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,960
What do we get?

98
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,820
Well, I'll let you work
out the details, but

99
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,000
it's not hard here.

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,550
You get -10 over root 10, which
is just negative square

101
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,180
root of 10 here.

102
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:35,260
Then I just get 2 square root of
10, and then I get, 1 is 2

103
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:44,760
square root of 10 and --

104
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,730
I think I made an error here.

105
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,350
Give me a second to look through
my computation again.

106
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

107
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,200
PROFESSOR: The two, one
entry should be--

108
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,410
oh, yes, thank you.

109
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,660
The two, one entry should be
the square root of 10.

110
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,890
Good, yes, that's what I was
hoping, yes, because we get--

111
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:20,980

112
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,200
Yes, I did it in the wrong
order, right, so your

113
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,710
recitation instructor should
know how to multiply matrices,

114
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,970
great, yes, thank you.

115
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,170
You multiply this first, then
this, then this, and then

116
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,430
this, and if you do it correctly
you will get this

117
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,030
matrix here.

118
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,510
Good, great.

119
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,370
So now I'd like this to be my
u matrix but it's actually u

120
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,570
times sigma, so I need to make
these entries unit length.

121
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:08,260
OK, so I get -1 over root 2, 1
over root 2, 1 over root 2, 1

122
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:14,680
over root 2, times my sigma
matrix here, which is

123
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,760
remember, 2 square root of 5, 4
square root of 5, and these

124
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,340
constants are just what I needed
to divide these columns

125
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,840
by in order to make
them unit vectors.

126
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:34,820
So now, here's my u matrix, 1
over square root of 2, -1 over

127
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,620
square root of 2, 1 over square
root of 2, 1 over

128
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,160
square root of 2, good.

129
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,060
So now I have all three
matrices, u v and sigma and

130
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,520
despite some little errors here
and there, I think this

131
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,950
is actually right.

132
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,530
You should go check it yourself,
because if you at

133
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,370
all like me, you've screwed
up several times by now.

134
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,520
But anyway, this is a good
little illustration of how to

135
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,120
find the singular value
decomposition.

136
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,540
Recall that you're looking for
u sigma v transpose where u

137
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,040
and v are orthogonal matrices,
and sigma is diagonal with

138
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,410
non-negative entries.

139
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:22,390
And you find it using these two
equations, you compute c

140
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:27,100
transpose c, that's v sigma
transfer sigma times v

141
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,340
transpose, and you also
have c v is u's sigma.

142
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,850
I hope this was a helpful
illustration.

143
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,850
