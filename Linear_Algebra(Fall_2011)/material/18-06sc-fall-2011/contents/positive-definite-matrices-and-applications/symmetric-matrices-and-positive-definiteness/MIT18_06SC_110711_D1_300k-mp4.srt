00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,700

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,490
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,780
Welcome back.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,030
So today, I'd like
to talk about

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,050
positive definite matrices.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,650
And specifically, we're going to
analyze several properties

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,440
of positive definite matrices.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,620
And specifically, we're going
to look at why each one of

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,710
these following statements
is true.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,410
So first off, why every positive
definite matrix is

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,970
invertible.

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,560
Why the only positive definite
projection matrix is the

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,860
identity matrix.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,840
If d is a diagonal matrix with
positive entries, show that it

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,010
must also be positive
definite.

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,350
And then lastly, if S is a
symmetric matrix where the

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,430
determinant S is bigger than
0, show why this might not

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,870
necessarily imply that it's
positive definite.

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,320
So I'll let you think about
these for a moment.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,570
And I'll come back
in a second.

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:08,730

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,410
Hi, everyone.

23
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,640
Welcome back.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,170
OK.

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,480
So let's take a look at part
A. So part A is asking why

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,140
every positive definite
matrix is invertible.

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,250
Well, let's just recall that if
A is a matrix and if A is

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:35,320
invertible, then this
necessarily implies that the

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,795
determinant of A is non-zero.

30
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:40,890

31
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,190
And I'm going to just write out
detA as the product of the

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:54,970
eigenvalues of A. So lambda
1 to lambda n are the

33
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,610
eigenvalues

34
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:07,070
of A. OK.

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:19,140
In addition, if A is positive
definite, what does this say

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,000
about the eigenvalues of A?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,900
Well, it says that each
eigenvalue of A, lambda 1,

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,700
lambda 2, dot, dot, dot, to
lambda n, each one of them

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,440
must be bigger than 0.

40
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,190
So this statement that each
eigenvalue of A is bigger than

41
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,360
0 is completely equivalent to A
being positive definite for

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,860
symmetric matrices A.

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,260
So if I have a whole bunch of
eigenvalues and each of them

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,880
are bigger than 0, what does
this say about detA?

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,830

46
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,780
Well, I can take the product
of all these eigenvalues.

47
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,460

48
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,540
And of course, the product of
a whole bunch of positive

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,660
numbers must also be positive.

50
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,540

51
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,210
So if the quantity is positive,
then it certainly

52
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,800
cannot equal 0.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,770
So this proves that detA
is not equal to 0.

54
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,680
Hence, A must be invertible.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,090
OK.

56
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:31,040
So for part B, we're asked to
show that the only positive

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,070
definite projection matrix
is the identity matrix.

58
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,220
So again, how do we tackle
this problem?

59
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,930
We're going to look at
the eigenvalues.

60
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:50,190
So remember if P is a
projection, what does it say

61
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,080
about the eigenvalues of P?

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:03,520
Well, it says that the
eigenvalues of P

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,370
are either 0 or 1.

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,390

65
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,520
So this is point one.

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:25,790
Point two, if P is a positive
definite, what does that say

67
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,706
about the eigenvalues of P?

68
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:43,750
Well, as I've noted before, it
means that the eigenvalues are

69
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,000
bigger than 0.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,210

71
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,810
So if P is a projection and it's
positive definite, the

72
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,750
only possible eigenvalues that
are both 0 and 1 and bigger

73
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,310
than 0 are 1.

74
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:09,540
So the conclusion is that
the eigenvalues of P

75
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,950
must all equal 1.

76
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,000
So which matrix has eigenvalues

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,870
1 and is also symmetric?

78
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:26,380
Well, the only matrix that
satisfies this property is the

79
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,660
identity matrix.

80
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,270
Now you might ask, how do
you actually show that?

81
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,170
Well, you could argue
as follows.

82
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:47,470
If P is diagonalizable and
every symmetric matrix is

83
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,860
diagonalizable--

84
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,980
so I'm not making this up.

85
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,650
So if P is diagonalizable, then
you can always write P as

86
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,670
some matrix, U, times
a diagonal matrix.

87
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,180
And we know in this case,
the diagonal matrix has

88
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,900
eigenvalues 1.

89
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,130
So it's actually the identity
matrix times the inverse of

90
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,380
the eigenvector matrix.

91
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,530

92
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,760
But of course, this is just U
times U inverse, which then

93
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,660
gives me the identity
at the end.

94
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,970
So U times the identity
times U inverse.

95
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,090
This is just U times
U inverse.

96
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,540
And of course, U and
U inverse collapse

97
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,050
back down to the identity.

98
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,490
So this shows you that the
only matrix that has

99
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,420
eigenvalues of 1 is the
identity matrix.

100
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,790
So that's just to cross all the
T's and dot all the I's.

101
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,050
OK.

102
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,720
For part C, we're given D as a
diagonal matrix with positive

103
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,140
entries on the diagonal.

104
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,390
Now we have to show that
it's positive definite.

105
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,640
OK.

106
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,290
So let me write D as follows.

107
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,310
I'll just write it like this.

108
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,580
I'm going to use a compact
notation, which is sometimes

109
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:05,600
seen diag d1, d2, dn.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,570
So d is a diagonal matrix
whose elements along the

111
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,130
diagonal are d1, d2, dot,
dot, dot, to dn.

112
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,200
Now what does it mean
for a matrix

113
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,220
to be positive definite?

114
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:28,530
Well, it means that for any x,
for any vector x, I have to

115
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,950
look at the product
x transpose Dx.

116
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,070
And I have to show that
it's bigger than 0.

117
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,800
And I should qualify this and
say that the vector we're

118
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,330
looking at is x not
equal to 0.

119
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,050
So we're now looking
at the 0 vector.

120
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,470
But for D to be positive
definite, we have to show that

121
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,320
x transpose Dx is
bigger than 0.

122
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,010
This is just one way to show
that it's positive definite.

123
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,260
It's not the only way.

124
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,160

125
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,872
So if I write x out using
components, x1, x2, dot, dot,

126
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:08,122
dot, to xn--

127
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:12,440

128
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,300
I'll write it like this--

129
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,050
then you can work out the
quantity x transpose Dx.

130
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,160
And we see that we get
a sum of squares.

131
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:28,690
We get d1 times x1 squared plus
d2 x2 squared plus dot,

132
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,694
dot, dot plus dn xn squared.

133
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:36,960

134
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,750
Now by definition, each
coefficient is positive.

135
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,290
A sum of a square is positive.

136
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,830
so A product of a
positive number

137
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,180
with a square is positive.

138
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,510
And then of course, a sum of
positive numbers is going to

139
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,060
be positive.

140
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,340
So this means the whole
thing is positive.

141
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Now there's other more efficient
ways of getting at

142
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,950
this using other
tricks we know.

143
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,110
For example, if we're given a
diagonal matrix, we know its

144
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,130
eigenvalues are already d1,
d2, dot, dot, dot, to dn.

145
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,420
And we know that a matrix with
positive eigenvalues is

146
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,010
already positive definite.

147
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,870
But this is kind of starting
from the base to show that

148
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,930
it's positive definite.

149
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,910
And now lastly, let's
look at part D.

150
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,730
So S is a symmetric matrix
with detS bigger than 0.

151
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,020
Show that S might not

152
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,110
necessarily be positive definite.

153
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,020
So there's lots of
counter examples.

154
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,480
I only need to construct one.

155
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,390

156
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,080
So I'm looking at S, which
is a symmetric matrix.

157
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,090
So I'm just going
to throw in some

158
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,930
numbers on some off diagonals.

159
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,400
So I'll just pick one.

160
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,040
And now I need to pick some
numbers along the diagonal.

161
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,670
And the easiest way to do it is
just to pick two negative

162
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,900
numbers on the diagonal.

163
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,410
Because if there's a negative
number on a diagonal, then we

164
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,320
know S can't be positive
definite.

165
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,680
And I'll say more about
that in a second.

166
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,390

167
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,380
So I can just pick negative
2 and negative 3.

168
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,955
So let's quickly check
what detS is.

169
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:21,520

170
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,460
Well, it's negative 2 times
negative 3 minus 1.

171
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,820
So this gives me 6 minus
1, which is 5.

172
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,610
So by construction, detS is
positive, which is good.

173
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,720
And then as I mentioned before,
if there's negative

174
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,320
elements along the diagonal of
the matrix, that matrix can't

175
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,500
be positive definite.

176
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,250
Well, why is that?

177
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:50,490
Well, suppose I wanted to take
a look at this upper left

178
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,760
component, negative 3, and it's
negative, how do I show

179
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,710
that that implies S is not
positive definite.

180
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,520
Well, what I can do is I can
look at the product x

181
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,770
transpose Sx.

182
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,790

183
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,750
And what I do is I look at it.

184
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,170
I just take one value of x.

185
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,050
So we know that this has to be
positive for every value of x.

186
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,280
So I can pick any
value I want.

187
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,660
So I can take x, say,
1, 0 transpose.

188
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,600

189
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:33,930
And when I do this, we end up
getting that x transpose Sx is

190
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,270
equal to negative 3.

191
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,500
So notice how by taking 1 in the
first entry and 0 on the

192
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,460
second entry, that picks
out the upper left

193
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,990
corner negative 3.

194
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,830
If I were to take 0 here and 1
here, it would pick out the

195
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:56,460
negative 2 entry and S. So by
picking 1 in entry i of a

196
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,670
vector x, and then computing
this product x transpose Sx, I

197
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,640
pick out the i-th element
along the diagonal.

198
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,670
And since that element is
negative, this shows me that

199
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,170
along the direction 1,
0, the product x

200
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,440
transpose Sx is also negative.

201
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,090
And hence, S can't possibly
be positive definite.

202
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,990
OK.

203
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,130
So just to summarize, we've
taken a look at a couple

204
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,190
matrices and a couple different
properties of

205
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,090
positive definite matrices.

206
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,460
And notably, we've used the
eigenvalues to get a handle of

207
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,330
the positive definite
matrices.

208
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,120
And I hope these provide
some useful tricks.

209
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,370
And I'll see you next time.

210
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,593
