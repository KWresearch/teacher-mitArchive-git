MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,760
Welcome to recitation.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,920
Today's problem is about
positive definite matrices.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,270
And it's asking us, for which
values of the parameter c,

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,500
which is sitting here in the
matrix, is the matrix B, 2,

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,640
minus 1, minus 1, minus 1, 2,
minus 1, minus 1, minus 1, 2

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,500
plus c, positive definite, and
for which values of c is it

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,950
positive semidefinite?

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,509
I'm going to leave you alone
with the problem.

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,435
You should pause the video and
then come back and compare

12
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,685
your solution.

13
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:42,850

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,300
And we're back.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,350
As you remember from the
lectures, there are several

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,340
tests that you can do on
matrices to find out if

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,130
they're positive definite
and if they're positive

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,110
semidefinite.

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,940
And I'm going to demonstrate
three to you.

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,360
First, I'm going to do the one
that you should do in case you

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,450
have very little time and you're
asked to do a problem

22
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,690
like this on the test, which is
of course the determinant

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:16,740
test. The determinant test
asks us to compute

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,870
determinants of the matrices
in the upper left

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,500
corner of all sizes.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,670
And it says that it's going
to be positive definite if

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,330
they're all greater than 0 and
positive semidefinite if some

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,730
0's sneak into into
that sequence.

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,860
So let's calculate
the determinants.

30
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,600
The first determinant is the
determinant of this tiny

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,930
matrix here.

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,400
So it's just 2.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,190
The next one is the determinant
of this two by two

34
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,680
submatrix, 2, minus 1, minus
1, 2, which is equal to 4

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,790
minus 1, which is 3.

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,310

37
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:07,000
And finally, we have the
determinant of B, which I'm

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,880
going to calculate for you.

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,310
I'm going to calculate it, I'm
going to decompose it along

40
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,810
the first line, first row.

41
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,470
So it's 2 times the determinant
of this submatrix,

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:32,970
2, minus 1, minus 1, 2 plus c,
minus minus 1, this one here,

43
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,390
times this determinant, which
is minus 1, minus 1,

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,340
minus 1, 2 plus c.

45
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,880
And then plus minus 1, this
one here, times this

46
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:58,280
determinant, which is minus
1, 2, minus 1, minus 1.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:13,390
And in total, that's 2 times 4
plus 2c minus 1 plus minus 2

48
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:25,440
minus c minus 1 and
minus 1 plus 2.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:35,330
And in total, this should give
us 6 plus 4c minus 3 minus c

50
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,030
minus 3, which is 3c.

51
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,530

52
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,030
So let's look at the
determinants.

53
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,130
2 is positive.

54
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,440
3 is positive.

55
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,080
3c is positive.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,700
So the answer is the matrix is
positive definite if c is

57
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,200
bigger than 0, and it's positive
semidefinite if it's

58
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,970
either strictly bigger
than 0 or equal to 0.

59
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,770
And that's all.

60
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,160
If you're on the test, this is
everything that you should do.

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,880
Now let me show you two more
tests to demonstrate that

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,500
first, they take longer, and
second, to see these numbers

63
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,420
and their quotients show up in
other tests and to try to

64
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,295
convince you that these tests
really are equivalent.

65
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,060
Let me do the pivots
test for you.

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,990

67
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,160
So we take our matrix B, 2,
minus 1, minus 1, minus 1, 2,

68
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
minus 1, minus 1, minus
1, 2 plus c.

69
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,970
And let's pretend we're solving
a system that has this

70
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,550
as a matrix.

71
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,120
So we multiply the first row by
1/2, and we add it to the

72
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,120
second and to the third row.

73
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:08,630
We get 2, minus 1, minus 1, 0,
3/2, minus 3/2, 0, minus 3/2,

74
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,400
3/2 plus c.

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,450
So the first column is good.

76
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,880
And then we just replace the
third column with the third

77
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,330
column plus the second column.

78
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:29,710
And we get 2, minus 1, minus
1, 0, 3/2, minus

79
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:36,450
3/2, 0, 0, and c.

80
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:44,920
And so the pivots are
2, 3/2, and c.

81
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,730
And again, the answer
is as before.

82
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,550
It's positive definite if c is
strictly bigger than 0, and

83
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,880
it's positive semidefinite if
c is greater or equal to 0.

84
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,950
But I want you to notice
something else here.

85
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,670
So before, we had
2, 3, and 3c.

86
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,090
And now for determinants, as
these pivots, we have 2, 3/2,

87
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,020
which is the second determinant
over the first

88
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,800
determinant, and c, which can be
thought of as 3c/3, so the

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,180
third determinant over the
second determinant.

90
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,310
And something like this is
always going to happen.

91
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:28,940
And finally, let me do
the energy test, or

92
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,190
completing the square.

93
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:38,030

94
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,330
So one of the definitions of
positive definite, one could

95
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,760
say the definition because of
which we are really interested

96
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,910
in such matrices, is
the following.

97
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,220
It's positive definite if when
we consider this quadratic

98
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,650
form, so a form that maps x,
y, and z to this expression

99
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,580
here that's going to be
quadratic in x, y, and z, it's

100
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,800
positive semidefinite if
this is always greater

101
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,480
or equal than 0.

102
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,080
And it's positive definite if,
when we have an expression

103
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,230
like this and try to solve
this equals 0, the only

104
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,470
solution is that x, y, and
z all have to be 0.

105
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,500

106
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,830
So let's try calculating this
form, completing the squares

107
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,890
on it, and seeing these
numbers show up again.

108
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,730
So when I multiply this like
this, put in a B, do the

109
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,780
multiplication, we get
something like this.

110
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:53,740
2x squared plus 2y squared plus
2 plus c z squared minus

111
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,290
2xy minus 2xz minus 2yz.

112
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,850

113
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,620
And now let's try completing the
squares using the formulas

114
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,140
that I prepared for you up here
in this pop-up window in

115
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,430
the corner.

116
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,050
So let's try completing, we have
a formula for the square

117
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,150
of a plus b plus c and the
square of a plus b.

118
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:26,870
So first, we try to get
something squared so that this

119
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,500
something has all the x's that
appear here, so that we get

120
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,929
something squared plus some
expression that only

121
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,010
takes y's and z's.

122
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,559
I'm not going to do the
calculation in front of you,

123
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,490
further embarrass
myself with it.

124
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,915
But let me tell you that what
you get is 2 times x minus 1/2

125
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:52,890
y minus 1/2 z squared.

126
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,320
And this ate all the x's
that showed up here.

127
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,160
The remainder only
has y's and z's.

128
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,340
When you use the second of those
formulas in a pop-up

129
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,220
window to complete the square
of y's and z's, you get 3/2

130
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,230
times y minus z squared.

131
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:18,760
So this took up all the y's, and
we're left just with a z

132
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,900
that comes as c times
z squared.

133
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,990
And now, let's look
at the following.

134
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,760
This is a square of
some real number.

135
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,560
So that's positive.

136
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,580
This is a square of some real
number, so that's positive.

137
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,120
And this is a square
of some real

138
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
number, so that's positive.

139
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,670
They're all multiplied by
positive numbers, 2, 3/2, and

140
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,540
c, which we've already
seen here.

141
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,750
And so if c is bigger or equal
than 0, this is certainly

142
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,250
always bigger or equal than 0.

143
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,635
Now to the question of if this
can be equal to 0 without x,

144
00:09:56,635 --> 00:10:02,640
y, and z all being 0, well,
let's look at two cases.

145
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,370
If c is strictly bigger than
0, then let me write this

146
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:19,760
matrix here as 2, 3/2 and c
times 1, minus 1/2, minus 1/2,

147
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,370
0, 1, minus 1, and 0, 0, 1.

148
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,440
Let's imagine c is strictly
bigger than 0.

149
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,050
And let's see when can this
expression be equal to 0.

150
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,460
Well, as we said, it's a
sum of certain squares.

151
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,750
They're all greater or equal to
0, so they all have to be

152
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,150
equal to 0 for this expression
to be 0.

153
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,300
In other words, z needs
to be equal to 0.

154
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,430
y minus z needs to
be equal to 0.

155
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:55,030
And x minus 1/2 y minus 1/2 z
also needs to be equal to 0.

156
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,550
And since this matrix has all
the pivots, this can only

157
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,700
happen if x, y, and z
are all equal to 0.

158
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,200
On the other hand, if c is equal
to 0, then let me write

159
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,220
this matrix here again.

160
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,860
Take 2 out here.

161
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,750
Take 3/2 out here.

162
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:24,680
And write again 1, minus 1/2,
minus 1/2, 0, 1, minus

163
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,130
1, and 0, 0, 0.

164
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,660

165
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,080
And so imagining that c is 0,
when can this whole expression

166
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,970
be equal to 0?

167
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,630
Well, the last bit
is already 0.

168
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,850
We need to have y minus
z equal to 0.

169
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,510
And we need to have 1 times x
minus 1/2 times y minus 1/2

170
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,820
times z also equal to 0.

171
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,505
So we need to have x, y, z in
the kernel of this matrix.

172
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,790
But this matrix only
has two pivots.

173
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,710
It has one free variable.

174
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,150
So we can find a solution to
this times x, y, z equals 0

175
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,890
that's not 0 itself.

176
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,850
Namely, if you remember how to
solve systems like this, we

177
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,370
set z equal to 1.

178
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:14,580

179
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,080
From this, we calculate
that y has to be 1.

180
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,170
And then from this, we calculate
that x has to be 1.

181
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:31,910
And you can check that for in
case c is 0, this thing here,

182
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,360
when you plug it in here,
you really get 0.

183
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,910
In fact, this thing here is in
the kernel of the matrix B. In

184
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,990
fact, in case c is 0, the
columns of matrix B sum up to

185
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,240
0 because of this here.

186
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,980
And that's all I wanted
to say for today.

187
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,230
