MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,010
Welcome to recitation.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,590
Today's this problem is
about change of basis.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,700
It says the vector space of
polynomials in x of degree up

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,890
to 2 has a basis 1,
x, and x squared.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,140
That's the obvious basis that
you would write for that

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,260
vector space.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,150
But today we're going to
consider another basis, w1,

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,910
w2, and w3.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,310
And we don't know what w1, w2,
and w3 are explicitly.

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,700
What we know is that their
values at x equals minus 1, 0,

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,270
and 1 are given by
this table here.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,920
So there are 1 0 0,
0 1 0, and 0 0 1.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,740
We're asked to do
the following.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,990
We're asked to express
this polynomial.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:54,160
So y of x is minus x plus 5
in this basis, w1, w2, w3.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,480
We're asked to find the change
of basis matrices between

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,850
these two bases, 1, x, x
squared, and w1, w2, w3.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,440
And finally, we're asked to
find the matrix of taking

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,190
derivatives, which is a linear
map on this space, in both of

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,500
these basis.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,370
And let me give you an extra
level of challenge, which is

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,800
to try to do as much of this as
possible without explicitly

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,000
finding w1, w2, and w3.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,440
I'll let you think about the
problem and then you can come

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,940
back and compare your
solution with mine.

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:33,710

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,230
Hi.

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,370
Welcome back.

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:46,320
So to start with the problem
a, we need to find

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:55,470
coefficients alpha,
theta, and gamma.

33
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,820

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,850
So that y of x is expressed
through, with this

35
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,940
coefficient, in this new
basis, w1, w2, and w3.

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,030
now, one way to do that would
be to look at this table of

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,870
values, explicitly find w1,
w2, and w3, so a quadratic

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,400
polynomial is--

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,140
all the information we
need about it is in

40
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,740
values at three points.

41
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:34,110
So say w1 is a1 plus b times
x plus c times x squared.

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,560
Find a, b, and c.

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,850
Find w1, w2, w3 explicitly,
and then go back to this

44
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,220
system and try to find alpha,
beta and gamma.

45
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,420
However, there's a trick.

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,210
Let's try to see if we can do it
without finding w1, w2, and

47
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,830
w3 explicitly.

48
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,730
So let me try to see
what are the values

49
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,060
of y at these points.

50
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,870
So y is minus x plus 5.

51
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,300
So the values are 6, 5, and 4.

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,455
And let me, instead of
considering this equation, let

53
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:18,840
me evaluate it at x is minus
1, x is 0, and x is 1.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,165
What I get through this is that
w is what is minus 1.

55
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,480
Actually, let me write this--

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,420

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,920
I get w with minus 1, which is
a number, equals alpha times

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,780
w1 is minus 1, which is a
number, plus beta times w2 is

59
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:51,100
minus 1, plus gamma times
w3 at minus 1.

60
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:58,110
And similarly at 0, and
similarly at 1.

61
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,340
And now let me think of this
as a linear system that has

62
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,530
unknowns alpha, beta, and gamma
coefficients, these

63
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,120
values here at minus
1, 0, and 1.

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,420
And the right-hand side, well
what's written here on the

65
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,640
left-hand side. y at minus
1, y at 0, and y at 1.

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,520
If you write this in a matrix
and read off coefficients from

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,740
there, you get the
following system.

68
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,210

69
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,380
So this is the matrix of the
system read off from here.

70
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,630
These are the unknowns.

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,480

72
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,750
And these are the values
of the right-hand side.

73
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,360
And I hope you'll agree
that this is a very

74
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,410
easy system to solve.

75
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,900
We just get alpha is 6, beta
is 5, and gamma is 4.

76
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,040
So the solution to the first
part is y equals 6w1

77
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,420
plus 5w2 plus 4w3.

78
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,510
And let's notice
another thing.

79
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,220
No matter what values we put
here, this matrix is always

80
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,080
going to stay the same.

81
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,570
It's only the right-hand side
that's going to change.

82
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,160
So if we're given any other
polynomial now to express in a

83
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,620
basis w1, w2, and w3, we don't
have to do any thinking.

84
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,410
We don't have to do
any computations.

85
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,070
What we do is go back to our
table at the beginning and

86
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,930
just read off, let's go back
to the table, and just read

87
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,640
these values.

88
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,120
So in this case, y is
6 times w1, 5 times

89
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
w2, and 3 times w3.

90
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,530

91
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,070
And that's already a hint to
solving the b part, which is

92
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,440
find the change of basis
matrices between 1, x, x

93
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,930
squared and w1, w2, w3.

94
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,120
Change of basis matrices means
expressing one basis in terms

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,180
of another.

96
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,090
So as a part of the problem, we
will have to express 1, x,

97
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,930
and x squared in terms
of w1, w2, w3.

98
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,360
So let's just find their values
at these three points.

99
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,110
One is a constant, it just
takes value 1 everywhere.

100
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,310
x takes value minus 1 at minus
1, 0 at 0, and 1 at 1.

101
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:26,140
And x squared takes values 1
0 and 1 at minus 1 0 and 1.

102
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,760
And from this we can already
conclude the part b here, we

103
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:39,206
can conclude that 1 equals
w1 plus w2 plus w3.

104
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:46,680
That x equals minus
w1 plus w3.

105
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,800
And that x squared equals
w1 plus w3.

106
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,390
And from this, we can
immediately write one change

107
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,790
of basis matrix.

108
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:08,160
Namely, since we know how to
express 1, x, and x squared in

109
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,440
terms of w1, w2, and w3, we can
just copy this information

110
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:24,750
over to this matrix, getting 1
1 1, minus 1 0 1, and 1 0 1.

111
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,480
So which matrix is this?

112
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,240
This is a matrix, so we have 1,
x, and x squared expressed

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,030
in terms of w1, w2, and w3.

114
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,930
So if we feed this matrix
something expressed in the

115
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,520
basis 1, x, and x squared, say
a, b, and c, what is going to

116
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,730
throw out is the same polynomial
expressed in this

117
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,680
basis here, w1, w2, and w3.

118
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,680
So I'm going to just write that
this is a matrix of this

119
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,930
basis change.

120
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,570

121
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,170
How do we get the other one?

122
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,210
Well very easy.

123
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,880
We know it's just the inverse
of A. So this is going to be

124
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:23,000
the matrix that takes something
written in this

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,050
basis and transfers
it to this basis.

126
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,950
I'm not going to calculate
the inverse of a

127
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,070
matrix in front of you.

128
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,760
Instead I'm going to
consult my oracle.

129
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,900
Sorry about that.

130
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:42,190
And my oracle says that the
inverse should be 0 1 0, minus

131
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:52,390
1/2 0 1/2, and 1/2
minus 1 1/2.

132
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,640
And that solves the b part.

133
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,240

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,420
Let's go into the c part.

135
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,580
The c part required us to
find a matrix of taking

136
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,030
derivatives, which is a linear
map in the space of

137
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,520
polynomials, in both
of these basis.

138
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,000
So let's first do the 1, x, x
squared basis because that

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,860
one's easier.

140
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,830
I'm going to call it Dx.

141
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,430

142
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,760
So I'm going to work in
basis 1, x, x squared.

143
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,770
And what I want to express is
the transformation of taking

144
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,400
derivatives.

145
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,910
So here I'm going to write the
vector to which taking

146
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,425
derivatives maps the polynomial
1, which is 0.

147
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:38,150

148
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,930
And that this expressed in the
basis 1, x, x squared.

149
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,680
In the second column I'm going
to write x prime, the vector

150
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,020
to which Dx send to vector x,
and that's equal to 1, which

151
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,070
expressed in this
basis is 1 0 0.

152
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:04,590
And here I'm going to write x
squared prime, which is 2x,

153
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:10,750
which expressed in this
basis is just x.

154
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,060
That one was easy.

155
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,550
For the other one, well we could
calculate w1, w2, w3

156
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,100
explicitly, take the
derivatives, go back to the

157
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,050
table and repeat the procedure
that we did already.

158
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,490
So expressing these derivatives
in terms of w1,

159
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,810
w2, w3, and that's
a lot of work.

160
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,020
But we pretty much already
did most of this work.

161
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,390
So we know how to take
derivatives in this basis, and

162
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,240
we know how to go between
these two basis.

163
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,060
So if we want to take a
derivative of something

164
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:49,100
written in the basis w1, w2,
w3, well let's first write

165
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,960
this something in basis
1, x, x squared.

166
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,330
Then let's take a derivative
of it.

167
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,880

168
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,940
And then let's write it
back in the original

169
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,050
basis that we want.

170
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,060
So it's multiplication
of three matrices.

171
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,990
We have all three-- matrix
multiplication is easy.

172
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,350
And my oracle, again, says that
this should be minus 3

173
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:21,470
over 2, 2, minus 1 over 2, minus
1 over 2, 0, 1 over 2,

174
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,080
and 1 over 2, minus
2, 3 over 2.

175
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,710
And that solves the problem.

176
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,420
Now, one thing that I would want
to discuss in the end is

177
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,880
how did you do with respect to
my challenge, which was let's

178
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,770
try to do as much of it as
possible without finding w1,

179
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,650
w2, and w3 explicitly.

180
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,250
And it seems like we
did really well.

181
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,930
There's nowhere on the board
written w1 equals,

182
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,100
w2 equals, w3 equals.

183
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,780
But is it really so?

184
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,740
It's not.

185
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,550
We calculated the matrix
of A inverse here.

186
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:59,460
And what this really means is
that w1, w2, and w3 written in

187
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,760
the basis 1, x, and x squared
are as follows.

188
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,640
w1 is minus 1/2 x plus
1/2 x squared.

189
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,150
w2 is 1 minus x squared.

190
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,300
And w3 is 1/2 x plus
1/2 x squared.

191
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,270
So you can check your work with
the help of this matrix

192
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,500
in case you did find w1,
w2, and w3 explicitly.

193
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,890
And that's all I wanted
to say today.

194
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,428
