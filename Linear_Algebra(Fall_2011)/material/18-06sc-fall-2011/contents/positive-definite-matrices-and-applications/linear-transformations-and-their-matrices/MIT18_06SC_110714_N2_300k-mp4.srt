1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,460

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,370
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,460
Today, we're going to talk about
linear transformations.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,280
So, we've seen linear
transformations incognito all

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,290
the time until now.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,980
We've played around
with matrices.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,210
Matrices multiplying vectors,
say, in Rn and producing

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,030
vectors in Rm.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,140
So really, the language of
linear transformations only

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,470
provides a nicer framework when
we want to analyze linear

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,620
operations on more abstract
vector spaces, like the one we

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,950
have in this problem here.

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:51,290
We're going to work with the
space of two by two matrices.

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,170
And we're going to analyze the
operation, have the matrix A,

15
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,260
and we produce its transpose.

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,060
OK.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,160
So please take a few minutes to
try the problem on your own

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,410
and come back.

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:15,260

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,650
Hi, again.

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,080
OK.

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,600
So the first question we need
to ask ourselves is, indeed,

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,170
why is T a linear operator?

24
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,410
So what are the abstract
properties that a linear

25
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,800
operator satisfies?

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:39,120
Well, what happens when T
acts on the sum of two

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,760
matrices, A and B?

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,070
So we've produced--

29
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,560
this is the matrix.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,440
The transpose of A plus B. But
we know that this is A

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,890
transpose, B transpose.

32
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:04,270
And so, this is exactly T
of A plus T of B. So the

33
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,320
transformation that we're
analyzing takes the sum of two

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,620
matrices into the sum of
their transformations.

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,900
OK.

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:26,890
Similarly, it takes a multiple
of a transformation into the

37
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,360
multiple of the transformations.

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,650

39
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,280
So it takes the matrix C times
A to C times A transpose,

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,680
which

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,850
is C T of A. OK.

42
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,760
So it is a linear operator.

43
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,190
Now, can we figure out
what its inverse is?

44
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,480
Well, what does the
transpose do?

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,700
It takes a column and
flips it into a row.

46
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,810
So what happens if we apply
the operation once again?

47
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,220
Well, it's going to take the row
and turn it back down to

48
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,820
the column.

49
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:20,400
So applying the transformation
twice, we come back to the

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,810
original situation.

51
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:28,870
So therefore, t squared
is the identity.

52
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,640
And from this, we infer that
the inverse is the

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,890
transformation itself.

54
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,720

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,160
Now, this was part one.

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,250
Part two, we'll compute the
matrix of the linear

57
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,210
transformation in the
following two bases.

58
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,930
So the first basis
is, in fact--

59
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,110
it is the standard basis
for the space

60
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,260
of two by two matrices.

61
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,890
And the way we compute the
matrix, we first compute what

62
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,690
T does to each of the
basis elements.

63
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,640
So T of v1.

64
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,160
Let's go back.

65
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,410
So here.

66
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,350

67
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,020
So T takes the transpose
of this matrix.

68
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,620
And we see that the transpose
of 1, 0, 0, 0 is 1, 0, 0, 0.

69
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,290
So it's a symmetric matrix.

70
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,560
So T of v1.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,000
Here's v1.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
What about T of v2?

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,630
Come back here.

74
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,540
So this one comes here.

75
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,880
0 comes here.

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,300
And so we actually get v3.

77
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,740
So T of v2 is v3.

78
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,740

79
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,870
Similarly, T of v3 is v2.

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,810

81
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,890
And finally, T of v4.

82
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,050
Well, v4 is a symmetric
matrix as well.

83
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,650
So the transpose doesn't
change it.

84
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,900
OK.

85
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,940

86
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:25,030
Now, we encode this into a
matrix in the following way.

87
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:32,240

88
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:43,630
Essentially, the first column
will tell us how T of v1 is

89
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,380
expressed as a linear
combination

90
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,340
of the basis elements.

91
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,010
Or in this case, it's just v1.

92
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,900
So it's going to be 1 times
v1 plus 0, v2 plus

93
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,430
0, v3 plus 0, v4.

94
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,270
T of v2 is v3.

95
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:08,795
So we have 0, 0, 1, 0.

96
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:19,300
T of v3 is 0 v1, 1
v2, 0 v3, 0 v4.

97
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:27,260
And T of v4 is 0 v1, 0
v2, 0 v3, plus 1 v4.

98
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,420
OK.

99
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,400
So we've written down the
matrix of the linear

100
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,820
transformation, T, in
the standard basis.

101
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,140
And you can check that this
is exactly what we want.

102
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:50,960

103
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,360
The representation of some
matrix, say, 1, 2, 3, 4, in

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,080
this standard basis is, it's
the vector 1, 2, 3, 4.

105
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,560

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:15,690
T takes this to its transpose
1, 3, 2, 4.

107
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:24,990
So this in the basis is
represented as 1, 3, 2, 4.

108
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,670
Right?

109
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:36,810
And it's not hard to see that MT
multiplies this vector, we

110
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,240
get exactly this vector.

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,550

112
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,810
So we'll pause for a bit, so
that I erase the board.

113
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,070
And we're going to return with
the representation of T in the

114
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,492
basis, w1, w2, w3, and w4.

115
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:57,260

116
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,740
OK.

117
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:04,350
So let's compute now the matrix
T in the basis w1, w2,

118
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,650
w3, and w4.

119
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,680
We played the same game.

120
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,460
We look at how T acts on each
of the basis vectors.

121
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,250
So T of w1--

122
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,040
well, w1 is a symmetric
matrix.

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,170
So T of w1 is w1.

124
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,380
Similarly, with w2 and w3.

125
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,040
They're all symmetric.

126
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,730
What about w4?

127
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,929
Well, we see that the
1 comes down here.

128
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,590
The negative one
comes up here.

129
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,789
I mean, in the end we just get
the negative of the w4.

130
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,820
So, let me just write
this out.

131
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:51,770
We had T of w1 equal to w1, T
of w2 equal to w2, T of w3

132
00:08:51,770 --> 00:09:00,910
equal to w3, and T of w4,
was negative on w4.

133
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:08,130
So therefore, the matrix of the
linear transformation, T,

134
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,880
in this basis.

135
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,460
I'm going to call the
matrix M prime.

136
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,680
T has a fairly simple
expression.

137
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,660

138
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,890
The only non-zero entries
are on a diagonal.

139
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,220
And they're precisely 1,
1, 1, and negative 1.

140
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,700

141
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,610
And finally, let's tackle
the eigenvalues slash

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,270
eigenvectors issue.

143
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:46,440
Well, you've seen what an
eigenvector for a matrix is.

144
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,770
And the idea for an eigenvalue,
eigenvector for a

145
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,630
linear transformation is
virtually the same.

146
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,910
And we are looking for the
vectors v and the scale is

147
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:06,470
lambda such that T of v is
lambda of v. But if you guys

148
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:12,660
look back to what we just did
with w1, w2, w3, and w4,

149
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,330
you'll see precisely that w1,
w2, and w3 are eigenvectors

150
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,540
for T with eigenvalue 1.

151
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,640
And w4 is an eigenvector for T
with eigenvalue negative 1.

152
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:37,260
So yeah, we essentially have
solved the problem knowing a

153
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,910
very, very nice basis in which
we computed the linear

154
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,460
transformation, T. So I'll
leave it at that.

155
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,100
