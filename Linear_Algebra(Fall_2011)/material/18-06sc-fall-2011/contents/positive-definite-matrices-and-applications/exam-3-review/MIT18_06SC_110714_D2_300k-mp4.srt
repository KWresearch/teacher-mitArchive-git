DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,360
So for this problem, we're just
going to take a look at

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,420
computing some eigenvalues and

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,059
eigenvectors of several matrices.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,300
And this is just a review
problem for exam number three.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,950
So specifically, we're given a
projection matrix which has

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,860
the form of a a transpose
divided by a transpose a,

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,690
where a is the vector 3 and 4.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,490
The second problem is for a
rotation matrix Q which is the

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,920
numbers 0.6, negative
0.8, 0.8, and 0.6.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,130
And then the third one is for
a reflection matrix which is

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,280
2P minus the identity.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,600
So I'll let you work
these out.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,310
And then I'll come back
in a second, and

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,795
I'll fill in my solutions.

17
00:00:49,795 --> 00:01:02,380

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,470
Hi, everyone.

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,840
Welcome back.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,250
OK, so for the first problem,
we're given a matrix P, which

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,040
is a projection matrix.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,810
And from earlier on in the
course, we probably already

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,680
know that the eigenvalues
of a projection matrix

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,720
are either 0 or 1.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,160
And I'll just recall, how
do you know that?

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,870
Well if x is an eigenvector of
P, then it satisfies the

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,180
equation Px equals lambda x.

28
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,130
But for a projection matrix, P
squared is equal to P. So if P

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,700
is a projection, we have
P squared equals P.

30
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,530
And specifically, what this
means is P squared x is equal

31
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,620
to lambda x.

32
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,370

33
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:59,940
So we have P acting on P of
x is equal to lambda x.

34
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,450
And on the left hand side,
Px is going to

35
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,190
give me a lambda x.

36
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,300
Px again will give
me a lambda x.

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,130
So we get lambda squared
x equals lambda x.

38
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,590
And if I bring everything to
the left hand side, I get

39
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,420
lambda times lambda minus
1 x equals 0.

40
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,440
And because x is not a zero
vector, what that means is

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,120
lambda has to be
either 0 or 1.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,530
So this is just a quick proof
that the eigenvalue of a

43
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,070
projection matrix is
either 0 or 1.

44
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,170
So we already know that
P is going to have

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,390
eigenvalues of 0 or 1.

46
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,530
Now specifically, how do I
identify which eigenvectors

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,970
correspond to 0 and which
eigenvectors correspond to 1?

48
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,440
Well, in this case, P has a
specific form, which is a

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,030
times a transpose divided
by a transpose a.

50
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,270

51
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,300
So I'll just write out
explicitly what this is.

52
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,310
So a transpose a, 1 divided by
a transpose a, is going to be

53
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,550
9 plus 16 on the denominator.

54
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:17,920
Then we're going to have
3 and 4 and 3 and 4.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,650
Now when we have a matrix of
this form, it's always going

56
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,280
to be the case that the vector
a is going to be an

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,200
eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,100

59
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,350
So let's check.

60
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,840

61
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,510
What is P acting on a?

62
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:50,190
Well, we end up with the matrix
P is 1/25 3, 4, 3, 4.

63
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:59,120
This is the matrix P. And if we
acted on the vector 3, 4,

64
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,460
notice how this piece right
here, we can multiply out.

65
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,370
This is going to be a
transpose, and this

66
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,720
is going to be a.

67
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,270
And if we multiply these two
pieces out, we get 25, which

68
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,630
is exactly the denominator
a transpose a.

69
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,980
So at the end of the
day, we get 3,4.

70
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,120
Because the 25 divides
out with the 25.

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,200
Now note that this is exactly
what we started with.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,260
This is exactly a.

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,370
So note here that the vector
a corresponds to an

74
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,620
eigenvalue of 1.

75
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,200

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:47,080
Meanwhile, for an eigenvalue
of 0, well, it always turns

77
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,280
out to be the case that if I
take any vector perpendicular

78
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,810
to a, P acting on that vector
is going to be 0.

79
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,720
So what's a vector, which
I'll call b, that's

80
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,980
perpendicular to a?

81
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,290
Well, note that a is just
a two by two vector.

82
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,260
So that means there's only
going to be one direction

83
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,490
that's perpendicular to a.

84
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,900
Now just by eyeballing it, I can
see that a vector that's

85
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,740
going to be perpendicular to
a is negative 4 and 3.

86
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,550

87
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,220
So let's quickly check that this
is an eigenvector of P

88
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,860
with eigenvalue 0.

89
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,110
So what we need to show is
that P acting on this

90
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,270
vector, b, is 0.

91
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:34,430
So P acting on b is
going to be 1/25.

92
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:44,360
It's going to be 3, 4, 3, 4,
multiplied by negative 4, 3.

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,750

94
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:55,820
And note how when I multiply out
this row on this column, I

95
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,570
get negative 3 times 4
plus 3 times 4, which

96
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,910
is going to be 0.

97
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,860
OK?

98
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,740
So this shows that this vector
b has an eigenvalue of 0

99
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,700
because note that we can
write this as 0b.

100
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,966

101
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:17,450
OK.

102
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:23,090
For the second part, Q, what
are the eigenvectors and

103
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,860
eigenvalues of this matrix, Q?

104
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,740
Well, Q is a rotation matrix.

105
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,960
So I'll just write
out Q again, 0.6,

106
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,860
negative 0.8, 0.8, 0.6.

107
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,460
So note that we can identify the
diagonal elements with a

108
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,370
cosine of some angle theta.

109
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,820
And we can associate the off
diagonal parts as sine theta

110
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,830
and negative sine theta.

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,630
And the reason we can do that
is because 0.6 squared plus

112
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,030
0.8 squared is 1.

113
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,560
So this is a rotation matrix.

114
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,240
Now to work out the eigenvalues,
I take a look at

115
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,430
the characteristic equation.

116
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,880
So this is going to give me,
if I take a look at the

117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,180
characteristic equation,
it's going to be 0.6

118
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,280
minus lambda, squared.

119
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,020
Then we have minus times
0.8 times negative 0.8.

120
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,150
So that's going to be
plus 0.8 squared.

121
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,400
And we want this to be 0.

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,330

123
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,820
So if I rewrite this, I get
lambda is 0.6 plus or minus

124
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,740
0.8i, where i is the
imaginary number.

125
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,610
So notice how the eigenvalues
come in

126
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,450
complex conjugate pairs.

127
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,880
And this is always the case when
we have a real matrix.

128
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,900
So we can find, first off,
just the eigenvalue that

129
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,820
corresponds to 0.6 plus 0.8i.

130
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,400
And then at the end, we'll be
able to find the second

131
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,540
eigenvector by just taking
the complex conjugate

132
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,840
of the first one.

133
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,080
So let's compute Q
minus lambda i.

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,510

135
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,750
And if we have this acting on
some eigenvector, u, we want

136
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,780
this to be 0.

137
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:22,270
Now Q minus lambda i is going to
be, for the case lambda is

138
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:29,600
0.6 plus 0.8i, this is going to
give me a quantity of minus

139
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:38,570
0.8i, minus 0.8, 0.8,
and minus 0.8i.

140
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,600

141
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,320
And I'm going to write
down components of u,

142
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,151
which are u1 and u2.

143
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,010
And we want this to vanish.

144
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,410
And we note that the second row
is a constant multiple of

145
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,710
the first row.

146
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,870
Specifically, if I multiplied
this first row through by i,

147
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,180
we would get negative i squared,
which is just 1.

148
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,295
And then the second part would
be negative i, so we would

149
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:04,710
just get the second row
back, which is good.

150
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,770

151
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,330
So we just need to find u1,
u2 that are orthogonal

152
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,030
to this first row.

153
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,650
And again, just by inspection,
I can pick 1 and negative i.

154
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,190

155
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,750
So note that that would give
me negative 0.8i plus 0.8i,

156
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,460
and this vanishes.

157
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,380
So this is the eigenvector
that corresponds to the

158
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,810
eigenvalue lambda
0.6 plus 0.8i.

159
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,590

160
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:43,390
In the meantime, if I take the
second eigenvalue, which is

161
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:50,350
negative 0.8i, I can take u,
which is just the complex

162
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,780
conjugate of this u up here.

163
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,780
So it'll be 1 plus i.

164
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,610
So this concludes the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

165
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:00,730
of

166
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,760
this matrix Q. OK.

167
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:16,120
Now lastly, number three, we're
looking at a reflection

168
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,590
matrix which has the form 2P
minus I, where P is the same

169
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,350
matrix that we had
in part one.

170
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,100
Now at first glance, it looks
like we might have to

171
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,430
diagonalize this
entire matrix.

172
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:38,120
However, note that by shifting
2P by I, we only shift the

173
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,810
eigenvalues.

174
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,210
And we don't actually change
the eigenvectors.

175
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,950
So note that this matrix R,
which is 2P minus I, it's

176
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,110
going to have the same
eigenvectors as P. It's just

177
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,560
going to have different
eigenvalues.

178
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,330
So first off, we're going
to have one eigenvector.

179
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,970

180
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,990
So the first eigenvector
is going to be a.

181
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,060
So we have one eigenvector
which is a.

182
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:11,880
So we have one eigenvector
which is a.

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,800
And note that for the vector
a, it corresponds to the

184
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,500
eigenvalue of 1.

185
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,340
So what eigenvalue does
this correspond to?

186
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,640
This is going to give me
a lambda which is 2

187
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,150
times 1 minus 1.

188
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,030
So it's 1.

189
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,790
So note that a, the vector a,
not only has an eigenvalue of

190
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,940
1 for P, but it has an
eigenvalue of 1 for R as well.

191
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:53,380
The second case was b.

192
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,010
And remember that b has an
eigenvalue of 0 for P. So when

193
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:10,230
we act R acting on b, we'll
have 2 times 0 minus 1b.

194
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,040
So this is going to give
us negative b.

195
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,960
So the eigenvalue for b is
going to be negative 1.

196
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,880

197
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,370
OK.

198
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,740
And this is actually a general
case for reflection matrices,

199
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,610
is that they typically have
eigenvalues of plus 1 or

200
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,430
negative 1.

201
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,380
OK, so we've just taken a look
at several matrices that come

202
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,010
up in practice.

203
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,460
We've looked at projection
matrices, reflection matrices,

204
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,290
and rotation matrices.

205
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,020
And we've seen a little bit
of the properties of their

206
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,940
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

207
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,700
So I'll just conclude here, and
good luck on your test.

208
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,108
