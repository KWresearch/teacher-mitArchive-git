1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,250

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,700
PROFESSOR: Today, we're going to
be solving a problem from a

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,110
final exam.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,360
And here it is.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,800
It's about a matrix, A. 1,
0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,320
And we know that this matrix has
two eigenvalues 1 and 2.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,520
And we also know that if we do
elimination, the first two

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,130
pivots will be 1 and 1.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,020
And here are two questions
about this matrix.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,370
The first one is find lambda 3
in d3, the third eigenvalue in

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,870
the third pivot.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,780
And the second one asks you,
what is the smallest a33?

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,060
So if you can change this entry,
what is the smallest

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,810
number that you can put there
that will make the matrix A

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,660
positive semidefinite?

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,570
And also, if instead of changing
that entry, you do A

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,390
plus cI, what is the smallest
number, c, that will make that

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,200
matrix a plus cI positive
semidefinite?

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,450
There's also a third part to the
question, but we'll get to

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,370
that later.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,220
Why don't you hit pause and
work on these two parts?

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,840
And when you're ready, come
back and I'll show

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,090
you how I did it.

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:18,920

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,860
Hi.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,950
I hope you managed to
do parts A and B.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,710
Let's work on it together.

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:33,055
Part A. Well, we want to know
what the third eigenvalue is.

29
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,080
And you know what the
first two are.

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,510
What else do you know about
eigenvalues and the matrix?

31
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,720
You know that the sum of all the
eigenvalues of the matrix

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,260
is equal to the trace
of the matrix.

33
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:50,590
So lambda 1 plus lambda 2 plus
lambda 3 is equal to the trace

34
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,730
of the matrix.

35
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,750
In this case, you have 1
plus 2 plus lambda 3

36
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,180
equals to the trace.

37
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,285
The trace is the sum of
the diagonal entries.

38
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:03,290
So, come over here.

39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,720
The trace is 1 plus 1 plus 0.

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,860
The trace is equal to 2.

41
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,620
So we have 3 plus lambda
3 is equal to 2.

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:19,800
So lambda 3 is equal
to minus 1.

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Onto the third pivot.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,890
We don't really want
to do elimination.

45
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,190
That would take too long.

46
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,750
So there must be some trick
that we can use.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,610
Well, we have the first
two pivots, and we

48
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,570
want to know the third.

49
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,030
Remember, when you do
elimination steps, that does

50
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,380
not change the determinant
of the matrix.

51
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,410
And you're left with an
upper triangular.

52
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,670
So the determinant of that
matrix will be d1

53
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,310
times d2 times d3.

54
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,200
And it will still be equal to
the determinant of A. I guess

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,240
there's a small caveat that
I should point out.

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,140
The pivots are not always
the diagonal entries.

57
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,960
It might be that one of the
diagonal entries will be 0.

58
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,180
That happens if the matrix
is singular.

59
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,820
But here, all my three
eigenvalues are non-zero.

60
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,270
They are 1, 2, and -1.

61
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,330
So that won't happen.

62
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,840
So this is actually
possible to do.

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,410
The product of the three pivots
will be equal to the

64
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,440
determinant of A. And the
determinant of A is the

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,220
product of the eigenvalues.

66
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,840
1 times 2 times -1.

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,400
So it's equal to -2.

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,060
1 times 1 times d3
is equal to -2.

69
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,880
Here is your third pivot, d3.

70
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,460
That finishes part A. Is that
the result that you got?

71
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:54,240
Let's do part B. What is the
smallest a33 entry that would

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,520
make the matrix positive
semidefinite?

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,510
Well, first of all, note
that A is not positive

74
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,080
semidefinite yet.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,280
The eigenvalues are
1, 2, and -1.

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,310
-1 is negative, so the matrix
is not positive definite and

77
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,410
not even positive
semidefinite.

78
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,850
Positive semidefinite means that
all the eigenvalues will

79
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,529
be either positive or 0.

80
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,850
That is, non-negative.

81
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:30,430
So our matrix will be 1,
0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1.

82
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,660
And we're allowed to change
this third entry.

83
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,550
How do we figure out if this
matrix is positive

84
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,440
semidefinite or not?

85
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,700
Well, I was talking about
the eigenvalues.

86
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,100
But maybe the easiest way is
to do the determinant test.

87
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,670
The determinant of the small
one by one left uppermost

88
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,720
matrix is 1.

89
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,590
The determinant of the two by
two upper leftmost matrix is 1

90
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,100
times 1 minus 0 times 0.

91
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,950
1, also positive.

92
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,850
So we need to check that the
determinant of the whole

93
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,760
matrix will also be
non-negative.

94
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,870
So what is the determinant
of this matrix?

95
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,490
It is equal to the three
by three matrix.

96
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,870
So do you know how
to do it quickly?

97
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,610
There's this way that only works
for three by three and

98
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,940
not for bigger.

99
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,230
Which is, the determinant will
be 1 times 1 times a33.

100
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,495
plus 0 times 1 times 1.

101
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:34,990
That's 0.

102
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,730
Plus 1 times 0 times 1.

103
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,700
That's 0 again.

104
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:48,560
Minus 1 times 1 times 1 minus
1 times 1 times 1 minus a33

105
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,720
times 0 times 0.

106
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,320
That's 0.

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,850
So this is the determinant.

108
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,110
It's a33 minus 2.

109
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,350
And I want it to be greater
than or equal to 0.

110
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,670
This will guarantee that
the matrix is positive

111
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,990
semidefinite.

112
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,540
So a33 must be bigger
than or equal to 2.

113
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,820
The smallest value for a33
that will make the matrix

114
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,900
positive semidefinite is 2.

115
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,760
There's another part to the
question still, which is what

116
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,390
is the smallest c that will
make the matrix A plus cI

117
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,640
positive semidefinite?

118
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,520

119
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,620
How should we do this?

120
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:42,430
The quickest way is to do the
eigenvalue test. A has

121
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:50,570
eigenvalues 1, 2, and -1.

122
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,110
So A plus cI has eigenvalues.

123
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,300

124
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,190
Well, you're just adding
cI to the matrix.

125
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,820
And in this particular case,
you should know by now that

126
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,430
that keeps the eigenvectors the
same and adds the number c

127
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,795
to each of the eigenvalues.

128
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:15,260

129
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,830
And I want each one of these
to be non-negative.

130
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,290
For that to be true, I have
to have c greater

131
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,470
than or equal to 1.

132
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,580
c greater than or equal to 1.

133
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,950
So the smallest value that c
can take that will make the

134
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,670
matrix A positive semidefinite
is 1.

135
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,110
That solves parts A and
B of this question.

136
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,230
There is a part C to
this question.

137
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,480
Let me show it to you.

138
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,700

139
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,330
It's says, starting with one of
these three vectors, 3, 0,

140
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:01,790
0, 0, 3, 0, or 0, 0, 3, and with
uk plus 1 equals to 1/2A

141
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,820
times uk, what is the
limit behavior of uk

142
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,300
as k goes to infinity?

143
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,340
I've written the matrix 1/2 of
A here for your convenience.

144
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,900
And now, you can hit pause
and work on it.

145
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,350
And when you're ready,
we'll get back

146
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,830
and solve it together.

147
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:30,910

148
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,070
I hope you managed to
solve this one.

149
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,330
Now let's do it together.

150
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,900
Well, if you've noticed
the matrix

151
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,120
1/2A is a Markov matrix.

152
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,340
So there are all these results
about Markov matrices in

153
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,210
steady states and so on.

154
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,390
Usually, Markov matrices have
a unique steady state, but

155
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,300
that is only true when there
are no non-zero entries.

156
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,290
But here, there are.

157
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,620
So we can't guarantee that
there's a unique steady state.

158
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,030
What we can do is look at the
eigenvalues and see if this is

159
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,840
still true nonetheless.

160
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,510
What are the eigenvalues of A?

161
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,540
Of 1/2A?

162
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:22,130
Well, if you remember from part
A, the eigenvalues of A

163
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,350
were 1, 2, and -1.

164
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,810
So the eigenvalues of 1/2A--

165
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,070
taking a multiple does not
change the eigenvector.

166
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,266
But it changes the eigenvalue
by the same multiple.

167
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:45,690
It would be 1/2, 2 divided
by 2 is 1, and minus 1/2.

168
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,340
So here are the eigenvalues
of A. And there's only one

169
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,950
eigenvalue that has absolute
value equal to 1.

170
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,050
So you actually still get a
unique steady state vector.

171
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,050
So everything is fine.

172
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,620
We can proceed as usual.

173
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,590
And the usual procedure is
you find the eigenvector

174
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,930
corresponding to that
eigenvalue, 1.

175
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,510
And that will be the limit
behavior as k goes

176
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,590
to infinity of uk.

177
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,980
So what is the eigenvector
corresponding to 1?

178
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,680

179
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,930
Eigenvector.

180
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,020

181
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,010
Well, you already know how to do
this, so I will just write

182
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,420
the solution.

183
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,300
It is 1, 1, 1.

184
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:49,430
That means that uk, as k goes to
infinity, will converge to

185
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:56,180
some appropriate multiple of
this eigenvector 1, 1, 1.

186
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,700
How do you know which
multiple to use?

187
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,990
Well, as usual in Markov
matrices, when you do an

188
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,150
iteration of the process, when
you do uk plus 1 is equal to

189
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,810
1/2A times uk, that does not
change the sum of the entries

190
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,170
of the vector uk.

191
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,350
So whatever the sum
was here, it will

192
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,110
still be the same here.

193
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,560
If you go all the way back and
you start with u0, whatever

194
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,240
the sum of the entries was here,
that's what it will be

195
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,550
all the way through u1, u2, u3,
and so on, all the way to

196
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,930
the steady state, u infinity.

197
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:40,230
So whatever the multiple of 1,
1, 1, it has to have the sum

198
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,850
of these entries add up to 3.

199
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,490
Well, that's already there.

200
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,610
We already happened to pick the
correct eigenvector, so

201
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,860
that's very convenient.

202
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,510

203
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,930
The correct multiple is simply
the vector 1, 1, 1.

204
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,610
So the limit behavior of uk
as k goes to infinity is u

205
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,180
infinity equal to 1, 1, 1.

206
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,540
We're done.

207
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,790
Thank you.

208
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,322
