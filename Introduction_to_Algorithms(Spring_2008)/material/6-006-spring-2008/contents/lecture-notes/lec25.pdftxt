Lecture  25:  Beyond  6.006:  Follow-on  Classes,

Geometric  Folding  Algorithms


Algorithms  Classes  at  MIT:  (post  6.006) 

1.  6.046:  Intermediate  Algorithms  (more  advanced  algorithms  &  analysis,  less  coding) 

2.  6.047:  Computational  Biology  (genomes,  phylogeny,  etc.) 

3.  6.854:  Advanced  Algorithms  (intense  survey  of  whole  ﬁeld) 

4.  6.850:  Geometric  Computing  (working  with  points,  lines,  polygons, meshes,  . . . ) 

5.  6.851:  Advanced  Data  Structures  (sublogarithmic  performance) 

6.  6.852:  Distributed  Algorithms  (reaching  consensus  in  a  network  with  faults) 

7.  6.855:  Network  Optimization  (optimization  in  graph:  beyond  shortest  paths  ) 

8.  6.856:  Randomized Algorithms  (how  randomness makes  algorithms  simpler &  faster) 

9.  6.857:  Network  and  Computer  Security  (cryptography) 

10.  6.885:  Geometric  and  Folding  Algorithms  *  TODAY 

Other  Theory  Classes:
