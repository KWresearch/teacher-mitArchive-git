Due: 1 Day after SES #25 

Evaluation: 

Due on SES #25 

Rewriting and Revision:  A Distinction 

Choose the paper with the lowest grade.  If you have equal grades, choose the paper that you 
most want to reconsider. 

You have plentiful writing (and reading) experience and control of basic essay structures.  You 
understand that the author’s text is your one, true authority and that in its surfaces lie the 
wonderful depths that can continue to expand meaning for us as readers and thinkers. 

In rewriting, a writer rereads and rewrites a draft of the whole – clarifying and extending the 
fitness of its parts in a whole structure.  In rewriting, the writer becomes aware of the 
relationship of parts (paragraphs) to whole (essay).  For example, a good conclusion reflects the 
hypothesis of the beginning and the development of that by the middle. 

In revision, the writer has a new vision of his/her idea and, to incorporate the vision or put it into 
perspective, recasts the whole.  Such discovery depends on luck and readiness; luck is 
ungovernable, but rewriting, because it is a state of readiness intensified by slowed pace and 
close focus, may be the occasion of a new vision.   

Revision means that the writer has discovered a deeper or more original idea, hidden but implicit 
in her mind and her writing.  Attentive rewriting can find it and bring it out onto the page.   

Rewriting involves establishing correctness of spelling, syntax, and punctuation, including 
paragraphing.  It is a given that you will resolve any recurring issues of grammar, syntax or 
citation with a writing reference.  Good writing is made of consequential sentences. 

Of these, it is revision that can move the work most radically forward, sometimes changing it 
profoundly.  It is also a step we cannot demonstrate exactly or require anyone to take.  With that 
 
understanding, here is the assignment for your final paper in the course. 

Evaluation 

Write an evaluation of the trajectory of your work in the course as both reader and writer (1-2 
pages).  Approach this assessment with as much candor as you can; it is not meant to be an 
empty exercise in self-promotion nor will it in any way affect your final grade.  Here are some 
ways to think about the evaluation: did your approach to reading and/or writing change in any 
way. If so, how?  If not, go ahead and write about how and why that was the case.  If it remained 
static, why do you think that was so? Did you re-read stories or novels a second time?  How did 
that make a difference, if it did?  Are you the same or a different kind of reader/writer?  Many of 
you had already read Frankenstein – what was your experience in rereading it, if you did?
