Selected Passage from “An Encounter” 

Oran R. Payne 
21L.003 

 

“After an interval the man spoke to me. He said that my friend was a very rough boy and 
asked did he get whipped often at school. I was going to reply indignantly that we were not 
National School boys to be whipped, as he called it; but I remained silent. He began to speak on 
the subject of chastising boys. His mind, as if magnetized again by his speech, seemed to circle 
slowly round and round its new center. He said that when boys were that kind they ought to be 
whipped and well whipped. When a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him 
any good but a good sound whipping. A slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good: what 
he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping. I was surprised at this sentiment and involuntarily 
glanced up at his face. As I did so I met the gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me 
from under a twitching forehead. I turned my eyes away again.  
 
The man continued his monologue. He seemed to have forgotten his recent liberalism. He 
said that if ever he found a boy talking to girls or having a girl for a sweetheart he would whip 
him and whip him; and that would teach him not to be talking to girls. And if a boy had a girl for 
a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in 
this world. He said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that. He 
described to me how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery. 
He would love that, he said, better than anything in this world; and his voice, as he led me 
monotonously through the mystery, grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I 
should understand him. 
I waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly. Lest I should betray my 
agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was 
obliged to go, I bade him good-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly 
with fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached the top of the slope I turned 
round and, without looking at him, called loudly across the field: 
—Murphy! 
My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. I 
had to call the name again before Mahony saw me and hallooed the answer. How my heart beat 
as he came cunning across the field to me! He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was penitent; for 
in my heart I had always despised him a little.” (27-28)

What Is The Importance of The Encounter? 
 
What can a reader infer about a story from a single passage? How can a single event

completely change a character and their views on two conflicting groups? The James Joyce’s 

short story, “An Encounter,” is about two boys who skip school and have a strange encounter 

with an old, perverted man. Early in the story, the narrator is portrayed as an intelligent, 

imaginative boy who lacks the impetuousness and physicality of his peers. He admires, adults, 

who behave in a manner similar to him, and looks down upon boys who possess the qualities he 

lacks. However, the encounter with the old man forces the narrator to change how he views 

adults and boys, as well as broaden and unfold his own qualities. This meeting with a potential 

predator is the catalyst which prompts the narrator to develop characteristics he did not initially 

possess, such as bravery and poise, and to broaden his current traits, such as intelligence, to adapt 

to the situation. The evolution in the narrator alters the relationships that he has with the old man 

and Mahony. He is forced to examine and re-evaluate his own feelings about adults and boys, 

who are represented by the old man and Mahony, respectively.  

One of the characteristics of the narrator that evolves in this passage is the narrator’s 

intelligence. Initially, the narrator uses his intelligence in an innocent manner. He is the main 

planner behind the boys’ skipping school and exploring Dublin. However, in the above passage 

the narrator uses his intelligence in order to escape a more serious situation involving a potential 

predator. “Then I stood up abruptly. Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments 

pretending to fix my shoe properly” (27). Rather than running away abruptly and displaying his 

fear, the narrator demonstrates his intelligence by choosing a more subtle exit strategy in order 

not to alarm the old man or invoke a violent response. If the narrator had chosen otherwise, he 

might have offended the old man and incurred his wrath, which the narrator felt was a distinct 

possibility: “My heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles” (28). 

P a y n e | 3 

The encounter with the old man compels the narrator to apply his intellect to escape a serious 

situation that his peer, Mahony, is seemingly oblivious to.  

Another characteristic of the narrator that develops is his poise. Throughout the story, the 

narrator seems apprehensive and describes himself as acting out of fear. He is hesitant to engage 

in the rough play with Mahony and the other boys. However, in this passage he forces himself to 

behave in a brave manner. When calling to Mahony after leaving the old man, the narrator says 

that, “My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it” (28). After his harrowing encounter with 

the old man, the narrator maintains his composure and conceals his fear of the man. If the 

narrator had not maintained his poise and calmness and revealed his true feelings, he would have 

risked offending the old man and being ridiculed by his peers. Since Mahony did not feel that the 

man was a threat, he might have interpreted the narrator’s actions as an overreaction and a sign 

of cowardice.  

Earlier in the story, the narrator reveals his yearning to fit in with his peers as the only reason 

he engages in rough, violent games with them. He knows that if he had run away and revealed 

that he was scared of a seemingly innocuous situation, he would be mocked by his peers. Despite 

his fear and anxiety, the narrator is mature enough to project an outward appearance of 

confidence in order to remain safe from the old man and to maintain his standing amongst his 

peers.  

The narrator’s desire for acceptance from adults changes in this passage. When the old man 

enters into the story, the narrator strives to achieve his acceptance. The narrator lies to the old 

man about having read the same books as the old man in order to give an impression that he is as 

intelligent and studious as the old man, who claims to look down upon boys, like Mahony, who 

prefer to play games rather than engage in academic interests. The purposeful lying shows his 

desire for the old man’s approval as well as his own desire to be seen as superior to Mahony and 

to distinguish himself in the eyes of the old man. In other words, the narrator does this because 

he identifies more with adults than with other boys, because he feels that adults share his views 

P a y n e | 4 

and can appreciate the qualities that would not make him popular amongst his peers. The narrator 

disapproves of rough play, impulsiveness and a lack of emphasis on academic endeavors, which 

is what Mahony represents. The old man expresses a similar sentiment: “He said that my friend 

was a very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school” (27). The old man shares the 

same attitude towards Mahony as the narrator has, which furthers the connection established 

between the old man and the narrator. The old man also appreciates the scholarly qualities of the 

narrator, which the narrator feels make him inferior to his peers because seeming to be “studious 

or lacking in robustness” (20) are considered detriments. Not only boys look down upon the 

narrator’s qualities, but girls as well. Mahony, who acts opposite of the narrator, has multiple 

sweethearts, while the narrator has none.    

In the above passage, then, the narrator’s desire to please the old man is replaced by fear as a 

result of the man’s obsession with discipline and his accusation of lying. Earlier in their 

encounter, the narrator tells the old man that he has no sweethearts, which the old man responds 

to incredulously. When the old man takes on a more menacing, sterner tone with the narrator, he 

reveals his disbelief of the narrator’s claims: “And if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told 

lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world. He said 

that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that” (27). The accusation and threat 

by the old man disturb the narrator, and change his attitude towards adults. This encounter forces 

the narrator to realize that not all attention from adults is positive, and makes him re-evaluate his 

desire for their attention. Instead of being an asset, the narrator’s perceived maturity was 

detrimental because it garnered the attention of a pervert. If the narrator had behaved more like 

Mahony, who ignored the old man and followed his own rash desires, rather than seeking the old 

man’s attention and approval, the narrator probably would not have been exposed to the old 

man’s sadistic fantasies. This situation also compels the narrator to realize that he is not as 

mature as he wants others to think, and that there is virtue in immaturity.  

P a y n e | 5 

The attitude of the narrator towards boys he views as inchoate changes tremendously after 

his encounter with the old man, which exposes the narrator’s deficiencies. His new views affect 

his relationship of Mahony and how he views him. Throughout the story, the narrator and 

Mahony seem distant from each other. The narrator does not want to play the rough games with 

Mahony while exploring Dublin, and convinces Mahony to spare two younger boys from his 

rough play. The narrator also disapproves of Mahony bringing along his catapult. When the old 

man enters the story, the narrator is embarrassed by Mahony’s lack of knowledge and reveals 

that he thinks Mahony is stupid. The narrator subtly projects his feelings of superiority to 

Mahony and looks down upon him. In the selected passage, the narrator feelings towards 

Mahony change. After escaping from the old man, the narrator calls for Mahony and is 

astonished by his swift response. “How my heart beat as he came running across the field to me! 

He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was penitent; for in my heart I had always despised him a 

little“(28). The narrator reveals his true feelings about Mahony, who represents aspects of 

boyhood that the narrator greatly dislikes, such as violent play and lack of attention to education. 

Although Mahony embodies these aspects, the narrator does not despise Mahony; rather he 

dislikes certain characteristics of his.  

In the course of the story, the narrator comes to realize that the traits Mahony exhibits, such 

as his physicality and impulsiveness, are beneficial. Even though the narrator is more intelligent 

than Mahony, his intelligence did not protect him from the old man. The narrator feels that these 

traits that he lacks would have been beneficial in dealing with the old man. Had the narrator been 

more like Mahony, he would have left rather than stay and indulge the old man in his fantasies, 

or he would not have felt as intimidated. Since Mahony has these traits, the narrator is grateful 

that he is there to protect him. This newfound appreciation of Mahony causes the narrator to re-

evaluate his earlier feelings and makes him regret his views.   

 

The selected passage gives insight into development of the narrator and helps the reader 

better understand his motivations. The passage shows both the qualities, such as intelligence, that 

P a y n e | 6 

the narrator possesses, as well as those, such as bravery and physicality that he lacks. Also, a 

clear understanding of why the narrator is drawn to adults and resents children his own age is 

revealed. The encounter with the old man is the turning point in the story when the narrator’s 

intelligence, poise, desire for adulation from adults, and negative views on other boys are about 

to change. The narrator relies on his intelligence in a more serious situation than he had 

previously done while developing a poise which he lacked earlier in the story. In addition to 

these changes, the narrator realizes that there are negative consequences to wanting acceptance 

from adults and that traits exhibited by many boys his age that he previously resented have their 

value. All of these major changes illustrate the immense significance of the encounter to the 

development of the narrator.
