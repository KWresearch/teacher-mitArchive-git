Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Course Description *****
This course offers students ways to become more engaged and curious readers for
life. By learning the language of selected short stories and novels, students
learn the language of literary description. There will be a strong emphasis on
class discussion and writing. Readings will include fiction by O'Conner, Joyce,
Tolstoy, Mann, Shelley, and Baldwin.
***** Course Goals *****
"Reading Fiction" has several aims over the arc of the semester: primarily, to
increase ways for you to become engaged and more curious readers for life; to
increase your confidence in coming to greater consciousness as writers thinking
about literary texts; and to provide you with the language for literary
description, just as you already have the language for other kinds of
description. With as much presence of mind as possible, we will read essays,
short stories and novels, the forms and structures of which you will intuit
readily.

***** Course Requirements *****
Both written and oral communication will be required. Students are expected to
write a minimum of 20 pages of revised writing in spread over four essays and
frequent reading responses. One oral presentation as well as active class
participation is also required. There will be no examinations.
**** Class Participation (including oral presentation): 20% ****
Class and conference attendance as well as active participation in both are
required.
**** Oral Presentation ****
Every student is required to present a talk in class (7 minutes) on a passage
of your choosing from an assigned text on its assigned date. The talk should
help stimulate a discussion through arguments and questions.
**** Written Work: 80% ****
There will be four papers including one required revision during the semester.
Late essays will result in 1/3 letter grade reduction for every day (not class)
they are overdue. The paper assignments will follow that of the oral
presentation; each will be grounded in your primary response and evolving
analysis of that work through a specific passage that leads you to larger
considerations of the work as a whole.
***** Course Grades *****

***** MIT Literature Statement on Plagiarism *****
Plagiarismâuse of another's intellectual work without acknowledgementâis a
serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who
plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will
forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all
information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated
in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken
from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations
from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own
work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the
style guides available at the Writing_and_Communication_Center and the MIT_Web
site_on_Plagiarism.
