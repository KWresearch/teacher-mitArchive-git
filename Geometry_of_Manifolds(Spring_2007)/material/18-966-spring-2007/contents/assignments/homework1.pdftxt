1.  Show  that,  if   E  is a Lagrangian  subspace of  a symplectic vector space (V , Ω),  then 
any basis  e1 , . . . , en  of  E  can be extended  to a  standard symplectic basis  e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fn 
of (V , Ω).  

2.  For   which  values   of  n  does  the  sphere  S 2n  ⊂  R2n+1  carry  a  symplectic  structure? 
What  about  the  torus  T 2n  =  R2n/Z2n  = (S 1 )2n? 

3.  Let  {ρt}t∈[0,1]  be  the  isotopy generated  by  a  time-dependent  symplectic  vector  ﬁeld  Xt 
dρt
on  a  symplectic  manifold (M , ω),   i.e. ρ0  =  Id, 
=  Xt  ◦  ρt ,  and  iXt ω  is  closed.  Then  the 
dt 
ﬂux  of  {ρt} is   deﬁned   to  be

a)  Let  γ  :  S 1  →  M  be  an  arbitrary  closed loop,  and deﬁne Γ : [0, 1] ×  S 1  →  M  by  the 
formula  Γ(t, s) =  ρt (γ (s)),  so γt (·) = Γ(t, ·) is  the  image  of  the  loop  γ  by  ρt .  Prove  that

(Remark:  the  right-hand  side  is   simply  the  symplectic  area  swept  by  the  family  of  loops 
{γt}t∈[0,1] .  In particular,  equation (1)  implies that this  area depends  only  on the homology 
class  represented  by  γ !)  
b)  Does  the  symplectomorphism  φ  : (x, ξ ) 7→  (x, ξ + 1)  of  T ∗S 1  ≃  S 1  ×  R  belong  to   the 
group  of  Hamiltonian   diﬀeomorphisms? 
Hint:  assume  φ  is   generated  by  a  Hamiltonian  isotopy,  and  use  the  exactness  property 
(ω =  dα) to rewrite the right-hand  side of  equation (1)  in terms of  the 1-form  α. 

4.  The goal  of  this problem is to prove the following  result,  which  asserts that  all defor­
mations  of  compact   symplectic  submanifolds  are  induced  by  ambient  symplectic  isotopies: 

Theorem  1  Let  (M , ω)  be  a  compact  symplectic  manifold,  and  let   {Σt}t∈[0,1]  be  a  smooth 
family  of   compact  symplectic  submanifolds   in  (M , ω).  Then  there  exists  an  isotopy  ψt  con­
sisting  of   symplectomorphisms   of  M  such  that  ψt (Σ0 ) = Σt . 

We will  admit the following  classical (easy)  result:  there exists an isotopy  consisting   of 
diﬀeomorphisms   φt  :  M  →  M  such  that  φt (Σ0 ) = Σt . 
∗ω ,  and  prove  the  existence  of  a  time-dependent  vector  ﬁeld  Xt  such 
a)  Consider   ωt  =  φt 
d
that  d(iXt ωt ) =  − dt ωt .  Show  that,  if  the  vector  ﬁeld  Xt  can  be  chosen  to  be  tangent  to   Σ0 
at  every  point  of  Σ0 , then the theorem follows (by  modifying  φt  by  the  ﬂow  of  Xt ). 

b)  Consider   the  symplectic  normal  bundle  N ωΣ0  ⊂  T M|Σ0  whose  ﬁber  Np
ωΣ0  at  a  point 
p ∈  Σ0  is  the  symplectic  orthogonal  to  TpΣ0 .  Prove  that  the  vector  ﬁeld  X  is  tangent  to   Σ0 
if  and  only  if,  for   every  p ∈  Σ0 ,  the  restriction  to  Np
ωΣ0  of  the  1-form  α =  iX ω  is  zero. 
c)  Show  that,  given  any  1-form  α  ∈  Ω1 (M ) there  exists  a  smooth  function  f  :  M  →  R 
such  that,   for  every  p ∈  Σ0 ,  the  restriction  of  df  to  Np
ωΣ0  is  equal  to  that  of  α. 
d)  We  will  admit  the  fact   that,  given  one-parameter  families  of  1-forms  αt  and  of  sym­
plectic  forms   ωt  depending  smoothly  on  t,  the  functions  ft  constructed in (c)  can be  chosen 
to  depend  smoothly  on  t.  Complete  the  proof  of  the  Theorem.
