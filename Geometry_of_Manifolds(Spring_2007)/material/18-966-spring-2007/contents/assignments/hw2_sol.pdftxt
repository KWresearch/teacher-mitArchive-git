1.  Equip  R7  =  Im O =  {a + be,  Re a = 0}  with  the  cross-product  x × y  =  Im(xy).  By 
deﬁnition of the octonion product, if x, y ∩ Im O then Re(xy) = −�x, y⇔ (the usual Euclidean 
scalar  product  on  R7 ).  Indeed, 

Re((a + be)(a �  + b� e)) = Re(aa �  − b� b) = Re(−aa�  − b� b) = −�a, a � ⇔ − �b, b� ⇔. 

Therefore  ∈x × y∈ = ∈Im(xy)∈ � ∈xy∈ = ∈x∈∈y∈,  with  equality  iﬀ  x ∀ y .  Let  x ∩ S 6  ⊥ R7 , 
and  let  y ∩ TxS 6  � x �  ⊥ R7 .  Then  we  deﬁne 

Jx (y) = x × y . 

Note  that,  since  y ∀ x,  we  have  Jx (y) = x × y = xy + �x, y⇔ = xy . 
We  have  to  prove  that  Jx  maps  TxS 6  to  itself,  and  that  Jx 
2  = −Id.  For  this  purpose,  let 
x = a + be  be  a  unit  imaginary  octonion  (¯a = −a)  and  let  y = c + de  be  any  octonion:  then 

x(xy) = a(ac − db¯ ) − (¯ad¯+ c ¯b)b + (da + bc¯)ae + b(¯ca¯ − ¯bd)e 
a) ¯
= −|a|2 c − (a + ¯ db − c|b|2  − d|a|2 
c(a + ¯a)e − |b|2de
e + b¯
= −(|a|2  + |b|2 )(c + de) = −∈x∈2 y = −y . 

If  y  ∩  TxS 6 ,  i.e.  y  is  imaginary  and  y  ∀  x,  then  �x, xy⇔  =  −Re(x(xy))  =  Re(y)  =  0,  so  Jx 
maps  TxS 6  to  itself,  and  Jx 
2  = −Id. 

2.  a)  Any  vector  in  J L  is  of  the  form  J u,  with  u  ∩  L.  Given  u, v  ∩  L,  we  have 
�(J u, J v)  =  �(u, v)  =  0  (since  J  is  �-compatible  and  L  is  Lagrangian),  and  dim J L  = 
dim L  =  1  dim V ,  so  J L  is  Lagrangian.  Also,  �u, v  ∩  L,  g(u, J v)  =  �(u, J (J v))  = 
2 
−�(u, v)  =  0,  so  any  vector  in  L  is  orthogonal  to  any  vector  in  J L,  i.e.  J L  ⊥  L� .  Since 
2  dim V  = dim L� ,  we  conclude  that  J L = L� . 
dim J L =  1
b)  Assume  J  is  �-compatible,  and  let  L  be  a  Lagrangian  subspace  of  (V , �).  Choose  a 
g -orthonormal  basis  (e1 , . . . , en )  of  L,  and  let  fi  =  J ei  ∩  J L.  Then  �(ei , ej ) =  0  since  L  is 
Lagrangian,  and  �(fi , fj )  =  0  since  J L  is  Lagrangian.  Moreover,  �(ei , fj )  =  �(ei , J ej ) = 
g(ei , ej ) = λij .  Hence  we  have  a  standard  basis  with  fi  = J ei . 
Conversely,  if  there  exists  a  standard  basis  with  fi  = J ei ,  then  �(ei , J ej ) = �(fi , J fj ) = 
λij ,  and  �(ei , J fj ) = �(fi , J ej ) = 0,  so  the  bilinear  form  g = �(·, J ·)  is  symmetric  and  deﬁ­
nite  positive  (and  (e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fn )  is  an  orthonormal  basis).  Hence  J  is �-compatible. 

3.  a)  Recall  that,  for  any  vector  u ∩ TxM ,  ◦s(u)  is  the  vertical  component  of  dsx (u) ∩ 
Ts(x)L  (while  the  horizontal  component  of  dsx (u)  is  the  horizontal  lift  of  u).  Therefore  the 
assumption  that ◦s  is  surjective  at  every  point  of  Z  = s −1 (0) means  that  the  graph  �s  of  s 
is  transverse  to  the  zero  section  �0  ⊥ L,  and  hence  that  Z  = �s  ≤ �0  is  smooth.  Moreover, 
at  every  point  x  of  Z  we  have  TxZ  =  Tx�s  ≤ Tx�0 ,  i.e.  the  tangent  space  to  Z  is  the  set 
of  all  vectors  v  ∩  TxM  such  that  dsx (v)  is  tangent  to  the  zero  section,  i.e.  horizontal,  i.e. 
◦s(v) = 0.  Hence  T Z  = Ker ◦s. 

b)  Let  x  ∩  Z ,  and  assume  that  |α sx |  >  | ¯ |.
α sx We  want  to  show  that  the  restriction  of 
TxZ  =  Ker ◦sx  is  a  symplectic  subspace  of  (TxM , �x ).  This  is  a  linear  algebra  question 
involving  the  linear map ◦sx  : TxM  � Lx . 
Use  a  unit  length  element  in  Lx  to  identify  the  ﬁber  Lx  (a  rank  1  complex  vector  space 
with  a  Hermitian  norm)  with  C  equipped  with  the  standard  norm  | · |.  Then  ◦sx  becomes 
a  linear map  TxM  � C. 
Method  1:  Let  g  :  TxM  × TxM  � R  be  the  metric  induced  by  �  and  J ,  and  consider 
the  linear  form  α sx  : TxM  � C.  There  exists  a  unique  vector  u ∩ TxM  such  that  Re α sx  = 
g(u, ·);  because  α sx  ⊂ J  = iα sx , we  have  Im α sx  = g(−J u, ·).  Similarly,  there  exists  a  unique 
v  ∩ TxM  such  that  Re ¯ = g(v , 
| >  | ¯
·), and Im ¯ = g(J v , 
α sx |  is
·).  The  assumption  |α sx
α sx 
α sx 
equivalent  to  the  property  g(u, u) > g(v , v). 
+ ¯
Since  ◦sx  =  α sx 
α sx ,  we  have  Re ◦sx  =  g(u + v , ·) =  �(−J u − J v , ·),  and  Im ◦sx  =
g(−J u + J v , ·) = �(−u + v , ·).  Hence,  E  = TxZ  = Ker ◦sx  is  the  set  of  all  tangent  vectors 
that are symplectically orthogonal to −J u−J v and −u+v , i.e. E �  = span(−J u−J v , −u+v). 
Recall  that E  ⊥ (TxM , �)  is a  symplectic  subspace ⊕ TxM  = E → E �  ⊕ E �  is a  symplectic 
subspace.  So  we  just  need  to  check  that  the  restriction  of  �  to  E �  is  non-degenerate.  Since 

�(−u + v , −J u − J v) = �(u, J u) − �(v , J u) + �(u, J v) − �(v , J v) 
= g(u, u) − g(v , u) + g(u, v) − g(v , v) = g(u, u) − g(v , v) > 0, 

we  conclude  that  Z  is  a  symplectic  submanifold  of  (M , �). 
Method  2:  use  the  result  of  Problem  2  to  identify  (TxM , � , J, g)  with  (Cn , �0 , i, | · |). 
 
Then  α sx  : Cn  � C  can  be  written  as  α sx (u1 , . . . , un ) = �
�j uj  for  some  constants  �i  ∩ C, 
 
and similarly α s¯
x (u1 , . . . , un ) = �
ωj u¯j .  In order to prove that TxZ  is a symplectic subspace, 
we  consider  a  non-zero  vector  u  = (u1 , . . . , un )  ∩  TxZ ,  and  need  to  show  that  there  exists 
�j − ¯
v ∩ TxZ  such that �(u, v) = 0.  We look for v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) of the form vj  = iuj + � ¯
�ωj ,
where  � ∩ C.  The  condition

◦s(v) = �(iuj �j + � ¯
�ωj �j )+ (−i ¯

◦s(J u) 
gives  � = − 
|�|2  − |ω |2 ) 
On  the  other  hand,  since ◦s(u) = 

(note  that  |�|2  − |ω |2  = 0  since 

�(u, ��¯ − ¯
�ω ) = Im(

|�| = |α sx
α sx | =  |ω |).
uj �j  + ¯uj ωj  = 0,  we  have

Hence  �(u, v) = �(u, J u) =  |u|2  �= 0.
