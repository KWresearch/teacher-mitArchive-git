1.  Given  a  point  p  ∈  C  (a  two-dimensional  oriented  submanifold),  let  (e, f )  be  an 
′ 
oriented  basis  of  TpC ′  ,  orthonormal  with  respect  to  the  metric  g  induced  by  ω  and  J .  Then 
ω(e, f ) =  g(J e, f ) ≤ |J e| |f | =  |e| |f | =  1.  Meanwhile,  the  area  form  dvolg |C ′  induced  by  g 
on  C  is  given  by  dvolg |C ′ (e, f ) =  1.  Hence  ω|C ′  ≤  dvolg |C ′  at  every  point  of  C ′  ;  integrating,  
′ 
we  deduce  that [ω ] ·  [C ′  ] =  C ′  ω ≤  volg (C ′  ). 
� 
In  the  case  of  C  (an almost-complex  submanifold, equipped with  the orientation induced 
by  J ),  an  oriented orthonormal  basis  of  TpC  is  given  by (e, J e)  where  e  is  any  unit  length 
vector  in  TpC .  (Note  that  |J e|  =  |e|  =  1  and  g(J e, e) =  ω(e, e)  =  0).  Then  ω(e, J e) = 
g(J e, J e) = 1  =  dvolg |C (e, J e),  so ω|C  =  dvolg |C ,  and [ω ] ·  [C ] =  C  ω =  volg (C ). 
� 
In  conclusion,   volg (C ) = [ω ] ·  [C ] = [ω ] ·  [C ′  ] ≤  volg (C ′  ). 

2.  a)  The  homogeneous  coordinate  xn  is  a  linear  form  on  Cn+1  (namely, (x0 , . . . , xn ) 7→ 
xn )  and  hence,  by  restriction  to  the  tautological  line,  a  linear  form  on  L.  This  section  of 
L∗  vanishes  precisely  at  those  points  [x0  :  · · ·  :  xn ]  for  which  the  last  coordinate  is  zero, 
so  its  zero  set   is   CPn−1  ⊂  CPn .  Moreover,  it  vanishes  transversely,  and  the  orientation 
induced  on its zero  set is the natural  one (because all  orientations agree with  those induced 
by  the  complex  structure).  So  c1 (L∗ ) =  e(L∗ ) is  Poincar´e dual  to [CPn−1 ] ∈  H2n−2 (CPn ),   i.e. 
c1 (L∗ ) =  h.  Therefore  c1 (L) =  −c1 (L∗ ) =  −h. 
Given  a  line  ℓ  ⊂  Cn+1  (deﬁning  a  point  p  = [ℓ]  ∈  CPn ),  any  nearby  line  can  be 
parametrized  by  a  map   ℓ  →  Cn+1 ,  x  7→  x +  u(x),  where  u  ∈  Hom(ℓ, Cn+1 ).  This  gives  
a map (in fact a local  submersion)  ψ  :  Hom(ℓ, Cn+1 ) →  CPn  deﬁned  by  ψ(u) = [Im(Id + u)]. 
Its  diﬀerential  at  the  origin   is   Ψ  =  d0ψ  :  Hom(ℓ, Cn+1 )  →  TpCPn .  We  claim  that  Ψ  is  
surjective,  with  kernel  Hom(ℓ, ℓ)   ≃  C  (those  linear  maps  whose  image  is  contained  in  ℓ). 
Indeed,  this  can  be  checked  easily  in  the  case  where   ℓ  is  the  ﬁrst  coordinate  axis,  and 
ψ((u0 , . . . , un )) = [1 + u0  :  u1  :  · · ·  :  un ].  Therefore,  we  have  a  short  exact  sequence  of  vector 
bundles  0  →  C  =  Hom(L, L) →  Hom(L, Cn+1 ) = (L∗ )n+1  →  T CPn  →  0 (where  C  denotes 
the  trivial   line  bundle  over   CPn ).  
Taking a  complement  F  to the  subbundle  Hom(L, L) ⊂  Hom(L, Cn+1 ) (e.g. its  orthogonal 
complement  for   some  Hermitian   metric),  the  restriction  of  Ψ  to  F  is  an  isomorphism,  so   we 
conclude  that  Hom(L, Cn+1 ) = (L∗ )n+1  is  isomorphic  to  T CPn  ⊕ C. 
Since  Chern  classes   behave  multiplicatively  under  direct  sums,  and  c(L∗ ) = 1 + c1 (L∗ ) = 
1 + h,   we  have  c(T CPn ) =  c(T CPn  ⊕ C) =  c((L∗ )n+1 ) = (1 + h)n+1 .  Expanding  into  powers 
n+1  hk
of  h,  we  deduce  that   ck (T CPn ) = 
for  all  1  ≤  k ≤  n.

b)  Consider  X  =  P −1 (0),  where  P  is  a  homogeneous  polynomial  of  degree  d  in  the 
homogeneous  coordinates,  i.e.   a  section  of  (L∗ )⊗d .  Fix  any  connection  on  (L∗ )⊗d . 
If  we 
assume  that   P  is   transverse  to  the  zero  section,  then  at  any  point  x  ∈  X  the  linear  map 
(∇P )x  :  TxCPn  →  (L∗ )⊗
d  (which  does  not  depend on  the  chosen  connection  since   P (x) = 0)  
x
is  surjective and its kernel is TxX  (see Homework 2).  Therefore we get a short  exact  sequence 
of  vector  bundles  0  →  T X  →  T CPn 
d  →  0,  and  considering  again  a  complement 
|X  →  (L ∗ )⊗

Using  additivity  of  the  ﬁrst   Chern   class  of  a  line  bundle  under  tensor  product,  we  have 
c1 ((L∗ )⊗d ) = 1 + dh.  Let  α  =  h|X  ∈  H 2 (X, Z) (the  pullback 
hof 
by 
the inclusion 
→֒X:i
CPn ).  Using  the  multiplicativity  of  Chern  classes  under  direct  sums  and  their  functoriality 
under pullback,  we deduce that (1 +  α)n+1  =  c(T X ) ·  (1 + dα). 
Since  αn  =  0  in   the  cohomology   of  X  (for dimension  reasons), 1 + dα  is  invertible,  with 
�n−1
inverse (1 + dα)−1  = 
k=0 (−1)k dk αk .  The  total  Chern  class  of  T X  is  then  1 + c1 (T X ) + 
· · ·  +  cn−1 (T X ) = (1 + dα)−1 (1 + α)n+1 . 

3.  a)   The  Hodge  ∗  operator  on  Ω2 (M 4 ) satisﬁes  ∗2  = 1,  and  every  2-form  α  decomposes  
into the  sum of  a  selfdual part  α+  =  1
2 (α + ∗α) and  an  antiselfdual part  α−  =  1
2 (α − ∗α).   On 
an  even-dimensional   manifold,   d ∗  =  − ∗ d∗  in all degrees,  so Δ  =  dd ∗  + d ∗ d =  −d ∗ d ∗ − ∗ d ∗ d 
commutes  with   ∗.  Therefore,  if   α  is   harmonic  then  so  is  ∗α,  and  hence  so  are  α+  and  α−  . 
So  every harmonic form  α decomposes into the  sum of  a harmonic  selfdual form (α+ ) and 
a harmonic  antiselfdual form (α− ).   Moreover,  selfdual  and  antiselfdual  forms  are  obviously 
in  direct  sum;  so  H2  = 
H2  ⊕ H2 
−  (this  decomposition   corresponds  to  the ±1  eigenspaces   of 
+ 
∗  :  H2  → H2 ).

hα, β i  =  α ∧ ∗β  =  −α ∧  β  =  −β ∧  α  =  −β ∧ ∗α  =  −hβ , αi,  so  α ∧  β  is  pointwise  0,  and 
0.  Thus   H2  are  orthogonal  and deﬁnite positive (resp. deﬁnite  negative)  for the

b)  At  any  point  of  M ,  the  tangent  space  and  the  compatible  triple  (ω , J, g)  can  be 
identiﬁed  with (R4 , ω0 , J0 , g0 ), with  standard basis (e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 ),  and J0 (e1 ) =  e2 ,  J0 (e3 ) = 
e4 .  In  terms  of  the  dual   basis, 
Λ2  =  span(e 1  ∧ e 2  +  e 3  ∧ e 4 , e 1  ∧ e 3  − e 2  ∧ e 4 , e 1  ∧ e 4  +  e 2  ∧ e 3 ),
+ 
Λ2  =  span(e 1  ∧ e 2  − e 3  ∧ e 4 , e 1  ∧ e 3  +  e 2  ∧ e 4 , e 1  ∧ e 4  − e 2  ∧ e 3 ).
− 
Meanwhile,  ω =  e1  ∧ e2  +  e3  ∧ e4 ,  and  Λ2,0  is  spanned  by 
(e 1  +  ie2 ) ∧ (e 3  +  ie4 ) = (e 1  ∧ e 3  − e 2  ∧ e 4 ) + i(e 1  ∧ e 4  +  e 2  ∧ e 3 ), 
while Λ0,2  is   the  complex  conjugate;  it follows  that Λ2  ⊗ C = Λ2,0 ⊕ Λ0,2 ⊕ Cω .
Moreover,   the 
+ 
summands   in   this  decomposition  are  clearly  orthogonal  (both  for  the  standard   Hermitian 
product  hα, β i  =  α ∧ ∗β  and for the  complexiﬁed intersection pairing (α, β ) 7→  α ∧ β ;  in  fact 
the  two  coincide  in  the  selfdual   case),  as  follows  from  considering  the  types. 
Next,   we  observe  that   Λ2  is   the  orthogonal  to  Λ2  (for  either  one  of  the  two  above­
+ 
− 
mentioned  inner  products   on  Λ2 ); so Λ2  ⊗ C = (Λ2,0  ⊕ Λ0,2 )⊥  ∩ ω⊥  = Λ1,1  ∩ ω⊥  .

1,1  be  a  real harmonic (1, 1)-form.  Then  ∗α  is  also  a harmonic (1, 1)-form,   and 
Let  α ∈ HR 
hence  so  are  α+  and  α−  . At  every point  of  M  we  have  Λ2  ∩ Λ1,1  =  span(ω),  so α+  =  f ω  for  
+ 
some  function  f  :  M  →  R.  Moreover,  dα+  =  df  ∧ ω =  0.  However,  exterior  product  with  ω 
induces   an  isomorphism  from  Λ1  to  Λ3 ,  so  df  ∧ ω  =  0  if  and  only  if  df  =  0.  Therefore  f  is  
1,1  ⊂ H2 
constant,  and  α+  is   a  constant multiple  of  ω .  We  conclude  that HR 
− ⊕ Rω . 
Conversely, 
1,1  = 
ω  is a real (1,1)-form, and  so is any  antiselfdual form since Λ2
