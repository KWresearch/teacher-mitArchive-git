1.  Show  that  the  sphere  S 6  carries  a  natural  almost-complex  structure,  induced  by  a 
vector  cross-product  on  R7 . 
Hint:  view R7  as  the  space  of  imaginary  octonions.  Octonions  are  the non-commutative, 
non-associative  normed  division  algebra  structure  on  R8  =  H ∀ eH  with  product  given  by 
the  formula 

(a + be)(a �  + b� e) = (aa �  − b� b) + (b� a + ba� )e, 

�a, b, a� , b�  → H 

(a�  is  the  conjugate  of  a� ,  i.e.  x + y i + z j + tk  =  x − y i − z j − tk).  (You  may  use  the  fact 
that ⊗(a + be)(a� + b�e)⊗ = ⊗a + be⊗ ⊗a� + b�e⊗, where ⊗ · ⊗  is the usual Euclidean norm on R8 .) 

2.  Let (V , �) be a symplectic vector space of dimension 2n, and let J  : V  � V , J 2  = −Id 
be  a  complex  structure  on  V . 
a) Prove  that,  if  J  is �-compatible  and L  is  a  Lagrangian  subspace  of  (V , �),  then  J L  is 
also Lagrangian  and  J L = L� , where L�  is  the  orthogonal  to L with  respect  to  the  positive 
inner  product  g(u, v) = �(u, J v). 
b)  Deduce  that  J  is  �-compatible  if  and  only  if  there  exists  a  symplectic  basis  for  V  of 
the  form 

e1 , e2 , . . . , en , f1  = J e1 , f2  = J e2 , . . . , fn  = J en , 
with  �(ei , ej ) = �(fi , fj ) = 0  and  �(ei , fj ) = �ij . 

3.  Let (M , � , J, g) be a symplectic manifold equipped with a compatible almost-complex 
structure  and  the  corresponding  Riemannian  metric,  and  let  L  be  a  complex  line  bundle 
over  M  equipped  with  a  Hermitian  metric  | · |  and  a  Hermitian  connection  ⊕.  Given  a 
section  s  of  L,  deﬁne  � s, ¯
1 (⊕s(v) − i⊕s(J v))  and 
=  2
� s  →  �1 (M , L)  by  the  formulas  � s(v) 
¯� s(v) =  1
2 (⊕s(v) + i⊕s(J v)).

It  is  easy  to  check  that,  �x  →  M , (� s)x  :  Tx
is  C-antilinear, 
M  �  Lx 
� s)x 
and ⊕s = � s + � s¯ . (� s  and  � s  are  respectively  the  type  (1,0)  and  (0,1)  parts  of ⊕s).

a)  Prove  that  if  (⊕s)x  : TxM  � Lx  is  surjective  at  every  point  x  of  Z  =  s−1 (0),  then  Z 
is  a  smooth  submanifold  of M ,  and  its  tangent  space  is  given  by  TxZ  = Ker(⊕s)x . 
| ¯
b)  Prove  that,  if  |� s|  >  � s|  at  every  point  of  Z ,  then  Z  =  s−1 (0)  is  a  symplectic
submanifold  of M .  (Here  | · |  is  the  natural Hermitian  norm  on T x 
�M � Lx  = Hom(TxM , Lx ) 
induced  by  g  on  T M  and  the  Hermitian metric  on  L). 
Hint:  given a point x → Z , and choosing an identiﬁcation between the ﬁber of L at x and 
C  equipped  with  the  standard  norm,  things  essentially  reduce  to  a  linear  algebra  problem
