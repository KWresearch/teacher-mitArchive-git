1.  Let  E  be a Lagrangian  subspace of  a symplectic vector space (V , Ω),  and let  e1 , . . . , en 
be  a  basis  of  E .  We  proceed  by  induction,  assuming  we  have  constructed  f1 , . . . , fk−1  ∈  V 
such  that  the  family (e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fk−1 ) is  free   and  Ω(ei , fi ) = 1, Ω(ei , fj ) = 0 for  i  6=  j , 
and  Ω(fi , fj ) = 0. 
Because (e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fk−1 ) is free,  there  exists  a (non-unique)  linear form  τ  ∈  V ∗ 
such  that  τ (ei ) = 0 for   i  6
k ,  τ (fi ) = 0 for  i < k ,  and  τ (ek ) =  1.  Using  the  fact  that  Ω  is  
= 
non-degenerate (induces  an isomorphism between  V  and  V ∗ ),  there  exists fk  ∈  V  such  that  
Ω(·, fk ) =  τ . 
Let  us  check that the family (e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fk )  is  free.  Indeed,  if  v  =  �n
i=1 λiei  + 
�k	
i=1 µifi  =  0,  then  Ω(ei , v) =  µi  = 0 for  all 1  ≤  i ≤  k ,  and  v  = 
� 
λiei  = 0;  since the (ei ) 
form  a  basis  of  E ,  we  also  have  λi  =  0  for  all  i.  Moreover,  Ω(ei , fk )  and  Ω(fi , fk )  are  as  
prescribed. 
Therefore,  by  induction   we  can  construct  f1 , . . . , fn  such  that (e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fn ) is   a 
basis  of  V  (it’s   a  free  family  and  dim V  = 2n)  and  the  expression  of  Ω  in  this  basis  is   the 
standard  one.

2.  S 2  is an orientable  surface and hence carries a symplectic structure (its standard  area  
form,  for  example);  however,  for   n ≥  2,  the  compact  manifold   S 2n  has  H 2 (S 2n  , R) = 0,  so it  
cannot be  symplectic (for any  closed 2-form,  S 2n  ωn  = [ω ]∪n  ·  [S 2n ] = 0). 
� 
The  torus  T 2n  always   carries  a  symplectic  structure,  induced  from  the  standard  sym­
plectic  structure  of  R2n  (which  is   preserved  by translations).  (On T 2n  there  are  coordinates 
x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yn  ∈  R/Z =  S 1 ,  the  symplectic  form  can  be  written   as  ω  =  �  dxi  ∧ dyi .)  
Alternatively,  T 2n  is   the  product  of  n  copies  of  T 2  which  is  an  orientable  surface.  (Recall a 
product  of  symplectic  manifolds   is   symplectic.)

4.  a)  ωt  =  φ∗ω is   a  symplectic form,  and  d  ωt  is an exact 1-form  since it equals  φ∗

d(φ∗ 
t  (iYt ω)) where  Yt  is   the  vector   ﬁeld  generating  φt .  Hence  following  Moser’s  argument  we

so  ψt  is  a  family  of  symplectomorphisms.  Moreover,  if  we  assume  that  the  vector  ﬁeld 
Xt  is  tangent  to  Σ0  for   all  t,  then  by  integration  of  the  diﬀerential  equation  ρ0 (p) =  p, 
d  ρt (p) =  Xt (ρt (p)) we  obtain  that  ρt  maps  Σ0  onto  itself.  Therefore,  ψt (Σ0 ) =  φt (Σ0 ) = Σt .

(Note  that  the  ﬂow  is   well-deﬁned   because M  and  Σ0  are  compact.) 
b)  Consider   a point  p ∈  Σ0 :  because  the  symplectic  orthogonal  to  Np
ωΣ0  is  exactly  TpΣ0 , 
the  vector  ﬁeld  X  is   tangent  to  Σ0  at  p  (i.e.  Xp  ∈  TpΣ0 )  if  and  only  if  ωp (Xp , v)  = 0 
∀v ∈  Np
ωΣ0 ,  i.e.   if   and  only  if   iX ω  vanishes  on  Np
ωΣ0 . 
c)  Let  X  be  a  neighborhood  of  the  zero  section  in  N ωΣ0  =  {(p, v), p ∈  Σ0 , v  ∈  Np
ωΣ0}.  
Using  e.g.  the  exponential   map   for  an  arbitrary  metric  we  can  construct  a  smooth  map 
θ  :  X  →  M  such  that   ∀p  ∈  Σ0 ,  θ(p, 0)  =  p,  and  ∀v  ∈  Np
ωΣ0 ,  dθ(p,0) (0, v) =  v .  Consider  a 
point (p, 0)  of  the  zero  section  in   X :  we  have  T(p,0)X  =  TpΣ0  ⊕ Np
ωΣ0 ,  and  by  construction 
d(p,0)θ(u, v) =  u + v  for   all  u ∈  TpΣ0  and  v ∈  Np
ωΣ0 .  However,  TpΣ0  is  a  symplectic  subspace 
of  the  vector   space (TpM , ω),   so  TpM  =  TpΣ0  ⊕ Np
ωΣ0 ,  and  the  diﬀerential  of  θ  at  p  is   an 
isomorphism.  Therefore  θ  is   a  local  diﬀeomorphism,  i.e.  it  induces  a  diﬀeomorphism  over   a 
neighborhood  U  of  the  zero  section. 
At  any  point  p  ∈  Σ0 ,  the  restriction   to  Np
ωΣ0  of  the  1-form  α  ∈  Ω1 (M ) deﬁnes  a  linear 
ωΣ0  →  R.  Let h  :  N ωΣ0  →  R be  the function deﬁned by h(p, v) =  αp (v).  Finally, 
form αp  :  Np
let  χ  :  N ωΣ0  →  [0, 1] be a  smooth  cut-oﬀ function equal  to 1  over a neighborhood  of  the zero  
section  and  with  support   contained  in  U ,  and  let  h˜ (p, v) =  χ(p, v)h(p, v).  By  construction, 
d(p,0) h˜ (0, v) =  d(p,0)h(0, v) =  αp (v).  
Let  f  :  M  →  R  be  the  unique  smooth  function   with  support  contained   in  θ(U ) and  such 
that  f (θ(x)) =  h˜ (x) for   all  x  ∈  U .  Then  by  construction,  for  every  p  ∈  Σ0  and  v  ∈  Np
ωΣ0 , 
dpf (v) =  d(p,0) h˜ ◦  (d(p,0)θ)−1 (v) =  d(p,0) h˜ (0, v) =  αp (v),  i.e.  the  restriction  of  df  to  Np
ωΣ0  is  
equal  to  that   of  α. 

d)  Let  αt  be  a  smooth   family  of  1-forms  such  that  dαt  =  − d  ωt  (for  example  those 
dt
constructed in (a)),  and let   ft  be the functions  constructed in (c).  Then  ˜αt  =  αt  − dft  also  
satisﬁes  the property  that   dα˜ t  =  − d  ωt ,  and  additionally  the  restriction  of  ˜αt  to  N ωt Σ0  (the  
p 
dt
orthogonal  to  TpΣ0  with  respect  to  ωt ) vanishes  at  every  point  of  Σ0 .  Therefore  the  vector 
ﬁeld  Xt  such  that   iXt ωt  =  α˜ t  is   tangent  to  Σ0  at  every point  of  Σ0  (by the result  of (b)),  and 
LXt ωt  =  − d  ωt . By part (a)   this   completes the proof.
