1.  Let (M , ω) be  a  symplectic  manifold,  J  a  compatible  almost-complex  structure,  and 
g  the  corresponding  Riemannian  metric.  Show  that  two-dimensional  almost-complex  sub­
′ 
manifolds  of  M  are  absolutely  volume  minimizing  in  their  homology  class,  i.e.: 
let  C ,  C 
be  two-dimensional  compact  closed   oriented  submanifolds  of  M ,  representing  the  same  ho­
mology  class [C ] = [C  ′  ] ∈  H2 (M , Z).  Assume  that  J (T C ) =  T C  (and  the  orientation  of C 
agrees  with  that   induced  by  J ).   Then  volg (C ) ≤  volg (C  ′  ). 
Hint:  compare  ω|C ′  and  the  area  form  induced  by  g . 

2.  We  will   admit  the  fact   that  the  cohomology  ring  of  CPn  (the  set  of  complex  lines 
through  0  in  Cn+1 ) is   H ∗ (CPn , Z) =  Z[h]/hn+1 ,  where  h  ∈  H 2 (CPn , Z) is  Poincar´e  dual  to  
the  homology  class  represented  by  a  linear  CPn−1  ⊂  CPn . 
The  tautological   line  bundle  L  →  CPn  is  the  subbundle  of  the  trivial  bundle  Cn+1 × CPn 
whose  ﬁber at  a point  of  CPn  is the  corresponding line in Cn+1 .  The homogeneous  coordinates  
on  CPn  are  actually  sections   of  the  dual  bundle  L∗  .  (Convince  yourself of  this). 
a)   Show  that   c1 (L) =  −h,   and  show  that  the  direct  sum  of  T CPn  with  the  trivial   line 
bundle   C  is   isomorphic  to  the  direct   sum  of  n + 1  copies  of  L∗  .  From  this,  deduce  the  Chern 
classes  of  the  tangent  bundle  T CPn . 
Hint:  show  that  there  is   a  surjective  bundle  homomorphism  Hom(L, Cn+1 )  →  T CPn . 
What  is  the  kernel? 
b)  Let  X  ⊂  CPn  be  a  smooth   complex  hypersurface  of  degree  d,  i.e.  the  submanifold 
deﬁned  by  the  equation  P (z0 , . . . , zn ) = 0  where  P  is  a homogeneous polynomial  of degree  d 
(transverse  to  the  zero  section,  i.e.   with nonvanishing  diﬀerential  along  its  zero  set).  Show 
that  T CPn 
⊕ (L∗ )⊗d
|X  =  T X 
|X ,  and  deduce  the  Chern  classes  of  T X . 

3.  Let  M  be  a  compact  oriented  4-manifold,  equipped  with  a  Riemannian  metric  g . A 
2-form   is  said   to  be  selfdual  if   ∗α  =  α,  antiselfdual  if  ∗α  =  −α.  The  bundles  of  selfdual 
(resp.  antiselfdual) 2-forms  are  denoted   by  Λ2  T ∗M  and  Λ2 
−T ∗M  respectively.

a)  Show  that   the  Hodge  ∗  operator  induces  a  decomposition   of  the  space  of  harmonic 
forms  H2  =  H2 
⊕ H2 
−  into  selfdual   and  antiselfdual harmonic forms.  Show that, with  respect

to  the intersection pairing (α, β ) 
M  α  ∧  β , these  summands are deﬁnite positive (resp. 
7→ 
deﬁnite  negative)   and  orthogonal   to  each  other. 

b)  Assume  that (M , ω)  is   a  compact  K¨ahler  manifold  of  real  dimension  4.  Show  that  
Λ2  T ∗M  ⊗  C  = Λ2,0  ⊕  Λ0,2  ⊕  Cω ,  where  the  summands  are  orthogonal  to  each  other,   and

1,1 
Λ2 
∗M  ⊗  C 
ω⊥  ⊂  Λ1,1
. Deduce that the space of real harmonic (1,1)-forms is  HR  =

H2 
−  ⊕ Rω . 
(Since  algebraic  curves  in   a  complex  pro jective  surface  are  Poincar´e  dual  to  classes  in 
:=  H 1,1 (M ) ∩  H 2 (M , Z),  this  implies  the  Hodge  index  theorem,  which  asserts  that  
N S 
the  intersection  pairing  on  algebraic  cycles  in  a  complex  pro jective  surface  has  signature 
(1, dim N S  − 1)).
