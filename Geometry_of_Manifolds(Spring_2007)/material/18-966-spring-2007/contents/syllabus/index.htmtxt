***** Course Description *****
This is a second-semester graduate course on the geometry of manifolds. The
main emphasis is on the geometry of symplectic manifolds, but the material also
includes long digressions into complex geometry and the geometry of 4-
manifolds, with special emphasis on topological considerations.
***** Main Topics *****
    * Review of differential forms and de Rham cohomology
    * Symplectic manifolds; symplectomorphisms; Lagrangian submanifolds
    * Darboux and Moser theorems, Lagrangian neighborhood theorem
    * Complex vector bundles
    * Almost-complex structures, compatibility, integrability
    * KÃ¤hler manifolds, Dolbeault cohomology, Hodge theory, projective
      embeddings
    * Smooth 4-manifolds, intersection pairing, topological invariants
    * Smooth 4-manifolds vs. symplectic 4-manifolds vs. complex surfaces
The symplectic geometry part of the course follows the book by Ana Cannas da
Silva, Lectures on Symplectic Geometry (Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1764,
Springer-Verlag); the discussion of KÃ¤hler geometry mostly follows the book by
R. O. Wells, Differential Analysis on Complex Manifolds (Springer GTM 65).
***** Prerequisites *****
Geometry of Manifolds (18.965) or equivalent: manifolds, vector fields,
differential forms, vector bundles, homology, cohomology.
***** Homework *****
Grading for this course is based on homework. Homework assignments are due
every 3 weeks or so.
