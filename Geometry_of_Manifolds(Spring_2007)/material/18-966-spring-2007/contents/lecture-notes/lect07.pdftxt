1.1.  Lagrangian  intersections.  There  is  a  notion  of  Lagrangian  Floer  homology, which  is  not  always  deﬁned 
(in  fact,  there  are  explicit  obstructions  to  its  existence).  The  idea  is  to  count  intersections  of  Lagrangian 
submanifolds  L, L�  ⊂  M  in  a  manner  which  is  invariant  under  Hamiltonian  deformations  (isotopies).  Assume 
� 
that  L  and  L�  are  transverse  (if  not,  e.g.  when  L  =  L� ,  replace  the  submanifold  L  by  the  graph  Lt  of  an 
exact  1-form  in  T ∗L).  To  deﬁne  Floer  homology,  one  deﬁnes  a  complex  C F ∗ (L, L� )  whose  basis  is  the  set  of 
intersection  points,  and  whose  diﬀerential  is  given  by  ∂ p = 
q  np,q q ,  where  np,q  counts  solutions  to

Under  suitable  assumptions,  one  ﬁnds  that  ∂ 2  = 0,  giving  us  a  Floer  homology 
H F ∗ (L, L� ) = H ∗ (C F ∗ (L, L� ), ∂ ) 
(3) 
which  is  invariant  under  Hamiltonian  deformations  of  L, L� .  Moreover,  rk H F ∗  ≤ rk  C F ∗  = |L ∩ L� |. 
Theorem  2  (Floer,  Oh,  Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono).  Given  a  compact  Lagrangian  submanifold  L  ⊂  M  which  is 
∗  � 
”relatively  spin”  (i.e.  w2 (T L)  ∈  Im{i∗  :  H 2 (M , Z/2Z)  H 2 (L, Z/2Z)})  s.t.  i

:  H1 (L, Q)  H1 (M , Q)  is
injective,  then  ∀ψ ∈ Ham(M , ω)  s.t.  ψ(L)  intersects  L  transversely,  #(L ∩ ψ(L)) ≥ 
dim  Hi (L, Q). 
Remark.  Applying  this  theorem  to  the  diagonal  Δ  =  Δ(M )  ⊂  M  × M  and  the  graph  of  a  Hamiltonian 
diﬀeomorphism  f  on M ,  one  recovers  Arnold’s  conjecture.

2.  Almost-Complex  Structures

To  begin,  we  will  study  complex  structures  on  vector  spaces.

Deﬁnition  1.  A  complex  structure  on  a  vector  space  V  is  an  endomorphism  J  :  V  →  V  s.t.  J 2  =  −I . 
Thinking  of  this  J  as  multiplication  by  i  turns  V  into  a  complex  vector  space,  (x + iy)v  =  xv + yJ v .  If  V  is 
a  symplectic  vector  space  with  symplectic  form  Ω,  a  complex  structure  is  compatible  if  G(u, v) = Ω(u, J v)  is  a 
positive  symmetric  inner  product.  Note  that  being  symmetric  is  equivalent  to  Ω(J u, J v)  =  Ω(u, v),  and  being 
positive  is  precisely  Ω(u, J u) > 0  ∀u = 0
.

Example.  Let V  = (R2n , Ω0 ) be  the  standard  symplectic vector  space, with  standard basis  e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fn , 
and  deﬁne  J0  by  ei  �→ fi , fi  �→ −ei .  Then

This  gives  us  a  natural  isomorphism  with  Cn . 
Proposition  1.  If  (V , Ω)  is  a  symplectic  vector  space,  ∃  a  compatible  J .  Moreover,  given  any  positive  inner 
product  �·, ·�  on  V ,  we  can  build  an  Ω-compatible  complex  structure  on  V  canonical ly  (though  it  has  no  direct 
relation  to  the  given  inner  product). 
Proof.  For  the  ﬁrst  part,  taking  J  =  J0  in  a  standard  basis  gives  the  desired  endomorphism.  For  the  second 
part,  by  the  nondegeneracy  of  Ω,  we  have  isomorphisms  u  �→  Ω(u,  )  and  u  �→  �u, ·�  from  V  to  V ∗ .  We  thus

obtain  an  endomorphism  A  =  ��−1  ◦ Ω  s.t.  Ω(u, v) =  �Au, v�.  A  is  invertible  and  skew-symmetric  w.r.t.  ��, 
i.e.  A∗  =  −A  (since  Ω(v , u) =  �Av , u�  =  �v , A∗u�  =  �A∗u, v�  =  −Ω(u, v) =  −�Au, v�).  Thus,  AA∗  =  −A2  is

AA∗J  gives  a  ”polar  decomposition”  of  A.)  A  commutes  with 
AA∗ :  letting  Vi  be  the  eigenspace  of

A  = 
AA∗  with  eigenvalue  λi ,  or  similarly  that  of 
AA∗  with  eigenvalue

In  particular,  J 2  = −J ∗J  = −id.  For  compatibility,  note  that

thus  completing  the  proof.

Deﬁnition  2.  An  almost-complex  structure  on  a  manifold  M  is  J  ∈ End(T M )  s.t.  J 2  = −I  (i.e.  ∀x ∈ M , Jx 
is  a  complex  structure  on  TxM ).  If  M  = (M , ω)  is  a  symplectic  manifold,  J  is  compatible  if  ∀x  ∈  M , Jx  is 
ωx -compatible,  with  associated  Riemannian  metric  gx (u, v) = ωx (u, Jx v).  We  say  that  (ω , g , J )  is  a  compatible 
triple,  with  any  two  determining  the  third.
