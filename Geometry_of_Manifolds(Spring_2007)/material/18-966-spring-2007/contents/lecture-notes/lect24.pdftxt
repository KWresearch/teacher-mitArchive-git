1.  Homeomorphism  Classification  of  Simply  Connected  Compact  4-Manifolds 
Theorem  1  (Freedman).  M1 , M2  compact,  simply  connected,  oriented  smooth  4-manifolds  are  homeomorphic 
the  intersection  pairings  Qi  :  H2 (Mi , Z) × H2 (Mi , Z) 
→ 
⇔
Z  are  isomorphic  as  integer  quadratic  forms  (of 
|det  |  = 1).  It  suﬃces  to  check  that  the  fol lowing  invariants  coincide:  b2  =  rkH2 (M ), σ  =  2  −  b−
2  (the 
b+
signature),  and  Q(x, x)  mod  2∀x  (the  parity).

Example.  For  M  =  CP2 ,  we  have  QCP2  =  (1)  on  H2 (CP2 , Z) =  Z[CP2 ],  while  N  =  CP2  (with  reversed 
orientation)  has  QCP2  = (−1).  By  Mayer-Vietoris,  one  can  see  that  H2 (M #N )

Theorem  2  (Donaldson).  In  the  even  case,  Q = (2k).(±E8 ) ⊕ m

Remark.  The  Rokhlin  signature  theorem  (16|σ  in  the  even  case)  implies  that  the  number  of  ±E8  summands  is 
even. 
Remark.  The  11  conjecture claims that the m in the theorem above satisﬁes m ≥ 3k :  it has been shown (Furuta, 
1995)  that m ≥ 2k .

Remark.  Smooth  compact  4-manifolds  may  have  inﬁnitely  many  exotic  smooth  structures:  K 3  surfaces  are 
known  to  have  inﬁnitely many  smooth  structures,  as  do  the  manifolds  CP2#n.CP2  for  n ≥ 3. 
2.  Seiberg-Witten  Invariants  [J.  Morgan],  [Witten  ’94] 
Let  X 4  be  a  compact  manifold,  with  Riemannian  metric  g  and  spinc  structure  s.  The  goal  of  Seiberg-
Witten  theory  is  to  assign  a  number  to  the  pair  (g , s)  giving  the  number  of  “abelian  supersymmetric  magnetic 
monopoles”  on  the  manifold.

Deﬁnition  1.  A  spinc  structure  is  a  rank  4  Hermitian  complex  vector  bund le  S
X  along  with  a  Cliﬀord
multiplication  (unitary  representation  of  a  Cliﬀord  algebra)  γ  :  T ∗X  × S  →  S  (i.e.  γ (u)γ (v) + γ (v)γ (u) = 
−2�u, v�id  and  γ (u)∗  = −γ (u)).

Example.  For  {ei }  an  orthonormal  basis,  γ (ei ) ∈ U (S ),  since  γ (ei )2  = −1,  and  γ (ei )γ (ej ) + γ (ej )γ (ei ) = 0. 
� 
We  extend  our  Cliﬀord multiplication  to 
∗ (T ∗X ) × S → S, γ (e i1  ∧ · · · ∧ e ip ) = γ (e i1 ) · · · γ (e ip )

γ  : 
for  (ei )  orthonormal.  Applying  this  to  the  volume  form  gives  γ (vol)2  = (γ (e1 )γ (e2 )γ (e3 )γ (e4 ))2  =  id  and  thus 
a  decomposition  S  = S+  ⊕ S− ,  with  the  former  having  γ (vol) = −1  and  the  latter  γ (vol) = 1.  Moreover,  γ (ei ) 
maps  S±  to  S� . 
∼  End(S+  ⊕ S− ).  More  speciﬁcal ly,  we  have 
Lemma  1.  We  can  represent  complexiﬁed  forms  via  γ  : ∧∗  ⊗ C

Theorem  3.  Every  compact  4-manifold  admits  spinc  structures  classiﬁed  up  to  2-torsion  by  c  =  c1 (S+ ) = 
c1 (S− ) = c1 (L) ∈ H 2 (X, Z),  where  L = det  (S+ ) = ∧2S+  = ∧2S− .  Moreover,  c  is  a  characteristic  element,  i.e. 
�c1 (L), α� ≡ Q(α, α)  mod  2. 
In  particular,  if  E → X  is  a  line  bundle,  the  mapping  (S+ , S− )  �→  (S+  ⊗ E , S−  ⊗ E )  gives  a  twisting  of  the 
spinc  structure  by  any  line  bundle. 
Proposition  1.  If  X  admits  a  g -orthogonal  almost-complex  structure  J ,  then  ∃  a  canonical  spinc  structure 
given  by  S+  = ∧0,0  ⊕ ∧0,2 , S−  = ∧(0,1)  with
