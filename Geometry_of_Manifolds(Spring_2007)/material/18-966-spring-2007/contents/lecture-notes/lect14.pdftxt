1.  K¨ahler  Geometry 
Let  (M , ω , J )  be  a  K¨ahler  manifold,  with  ω  a  symplectic  form  and  J  an  integrable  complex  structure  com­

ai,j dzi  ∧ dz j ,  we  have  γ (J u, J v) =

−γ (u, v),  and  similarly  for  a  (0, 2)-form.  For  a  (1, 1)-form  γ  = 
γ (u, v),  implying  that  ω ∈ Ω1,1 .

Deﬁnition  1.  For M  a  complex manifold,  φ ∈ C∞ (M , R)  is  strictly plurisubharmonic  (spsh)  if on  each  complex 
chart  (U, zj ),  the  matrix  (  ∂φ  )  is  positive  deﬁnite  at  every  point.

We  have  the  following  converse. 
Theorem  1.  For  ω  a  closed,  real-valued  (1, 1)-form  on  p  ∈  M ,  ∃  a  neighborhood  U  �  p,  φ  ∈  C∞ (U, R)  s.t. 
ω =  i ∂ ∂φ.  This  φ  is  cal led  a  local  K¨ahler  potential  for  ω .

1.2.  Examples  of  K¨ahler  Manifolds.

Example.  Any  complex  submanifold of  (Cn , ω)  is K¨ahler, with  the  inherited  complex and  symplectic  structures.

Example.  Complex  pro jective  space  CPn  = Cn+1  � {0}/C∗  is  K¨ahler:  letting

Ui  = {(z0  : · · · : zi−1  : 1 : zi+1  : · · · : zn )} 
(3)	
be  the  standard  charts  ∼	
= Cn ,  we  have  the  Fubini-Study  K¨
ahler  form

zj dz j ) 
zj dz j  =

∂ ∂ f  = ∂
(1 + |z | 2 )2 
1 + |z | 2 
Applying  this  to  v ∈ T 1,0 , v ∈ T 0,1 ,  we  obtain 
|v | 2 
(1 + |z | 2 ) |v | 2  − |�z , v�| 2 
(1 + |z | 2 )2 
(1 + |z | 2 )2 
Since  2 
i ∂ ∂ f (u, iu) =  ∂ ∂ f (u1,0 , u1,0 ),  we  have  the  desired  positivity.  Moreover,  for  φ  a  transition  map  (WLOG 
between  U0  and  U1 ),  we  have  that  φ∗ f  =  log(1 + |z | 2 ) − log |z1 | 2  = ⇒  ∂ ∂ (φ∗ f ) = ∂ ∂ f  since 
∂ ∂ log |z1 | 2  = ∂

Finally,  recall  that H 2 (CPn , R) = R,  and H2 (CPn )  is  generated by  [CP1 ].  The  class  of  [ω ]  is  thus deﬁned by  the 
value  of

Example.  Any  complex  submanifold  of  CPn  (i.e.  complex  pro jective  variety)  is  K¨ahler. 
Theorem 2 (Kodaira Embedding).  Let (X, ω , J ) be a compact K¨ahler manifold, with  [ω ] ∈ H 2 (X, R) an integral 
class.  Then  ∃  a  holomorphic  embedding X � CPn  making  it  a  complex  projective  variety,  with  ω  diﬀering  from

Example.  In  the  70’s,  Kodaira  and  Thurston  independently  studied  a  closed  4-manifold  which  carries  both  a 
complex  structure  and  a  symplectic  structure  but  which  is  not  K¨ahler.
