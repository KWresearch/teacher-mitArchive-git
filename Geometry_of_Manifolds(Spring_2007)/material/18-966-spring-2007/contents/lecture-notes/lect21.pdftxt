1.  Counterexamples  contd. 
We  continue  our  discussion  of  the  Thurston  manifold  introduced  last  time.  Recall  that M  = R4 /Γ,  where  Γ 
is  generated  by  the  four maps 

g1  : (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )  �→ (x1  + 1, x2 , x3 , x4 ) 
g2  : (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )  �→ (x1 , x2  + 1, x3  + x4 , x4 )
g3  : (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )  �→ (x1 , x2 , x3  + 1, x4 ) 
g4  : (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )  �→ (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4  + 1) 
We  showed  last  time  that M  was  symplectic. 
Lemma  1.  H1 (M , Z) = Z3 . 
Proof.  One way  to  see  this  is  to  note  that  g3  = [g4 , g2 ],  so Ab(Γ) = Γ/[Γ, Γ] = Γ/�g3 � ∼ .  To  see  this  another 
= Z3 
way,  note  that  π1 (M ) = Γ  is  generated  by  the  four  loops  γ1 , γ2 , γ3 , γ4  given  by  the  coordinate  axes  in R4 .  Look 
at  γ4 :  this  can  be  described  as 
γ4  ∼ {(a1 , a2 , a3 , t), t ∈ [0, 1]} ∼ {(a1 , a2  − 1, a3 , t), t ∈ [0, 1]} ∼ {(a1 , a2 , a3  + t, t), t ∈ [0, 1]}

implying  that  [γ4 ] = [γ3 ] + [γ4 ]  and  [γ3 ] = 0  in  H1 (M )  (so  the  space  is  generated  by  the  images  of  the  other 
� 
three  loops). 

2.  Symplectic  Fibrations 
→ 
Let  f  : M B  be  a  locally  trivial  ﬁbration,  with  generic  ﬁber  (F , ωF )  a  symplectic  manifold. 
Deﬁnition  1.  f  is  symplectic  if  the  structure  group  reduces  to  Symp(F , ωF ),  i.e.  ∃  local  trivializations  f  : 
f −1 (Ui ) ∼= Ui  × F  → Ui  s.t.,  over  Ui  ∩ Uj ,  the  change  of  trivialization  is  a  symplectomorphism. 
→
Now,  let  f  :  M
B  be  a  compact,  locally  trivial  symplectic  ﬁbration  with  symplectic  ﬁber  (F , ωF )  and 
symplectic  base  (B , ωB ). 
Theorem  1  (Thurston).  If  ∃c ∈ H 2 (M , R)  s.t.  c|F  = [ωF ] = H 2 (F , R).  Then  ∀k >> 0, ∃  a  symplectic  form  on 
M  in  the  class  c + k .f ∗ [ωB ]  for  which  the  ﬁbers  of  f  are  symplectic  submanifolds. 
[η ] =  c,  and  a  cover  {Ui }  of  B  by  contractible  subsets  with

since  c|F  = [ωF ].  Thus,  ∃  a  1-form  αi  on  f −1 (Ui )  s.t.  p∗ 
i ωF  =  η + dαi .  Now,  let  ρi  be  a  partition  of  unity  on 
→ 
[0, 1], Supp(ρi ) ⊂ Ui ,  and  set  ˜η  =  η + 
d((ρi  ◦ f )αi ).  Then  ˜η  is  closed,  with

in  the  trivializations  φi . 
We  have  obtained  a  closed  2-form  ˜η  on  M  s.t.  [ ˜η ] =  c  which  is  symplectic  on  the  ﬁbers.  ∀x  ∈  M ,  split 
TxM  =  Vx  ⊕ Hx ,  where  Vx  =  Ker  dfx  is  the  tangent  space  to  the  ﬁber  and  Hx  =  {v  ∈  TxM |η˜(v , v � ) = 0∀v �  ∈

Vx}.  These  two  spaces  are  in  direct  sum  since  ˜η |Vx  is  nondegenerate.  f ∗ωB  is  nondegenerate  on  Hx  because 
∼  Tf (x)B , so  ˜η + kf ∗ωB  is  nondegenerate  on Hx  for  k >> 0  since  nondegeneracy  is  an  open  condition

symplectic  form  on M . 
Remark.  Assume  dim  F  = 2:  then  if  F  is  orientable  and  the  ﬁbration  is  oriented,  we  always  have  a  symplectic 
form  ωF ,  and  the  structure  group  always  reduces  to  Symp(F , ωF ) = Diﬀ +  (F ).  The  cohomological  assumption 
in  the  theorem  is  equivalent  to  the  statement  that  [f −1 (pt)]  =�
0  ∈  H2 (M , R)  (for  instance,  it  is  true  on  the 
vol
Kodaira-Thurston manifold). 
We  can  generalize  this  to  other  settings.

Deﬁnition  2.  A  Lefschetz  ﬁbration  is  a  map M 4  Σ2  between  oriented  manifolds  with  isolated  critical  points

) 
2  (so  the  central  ﬁbers  is  the  union  of  two  lines, 
z1
and  nearby  ﬁbers  are  smooth  conics). 
Theorem  2  (Gompf,  1998).  If  f  : M 4  → Σ2  is  a  Lefschetz  ﬁbration  with  [F ] = 0 
a  symplectic  form  s.t.  the  ﬁbers  are  symplectic. 
Theorem  3  (Donaldson).  For  (M 4 , ω)  symplectic,  after  blowing  up  points  in  M ,  we  get  Mˆ which  admits  a 
Lefschetz  ﬁbration  to  S 2 .  Here,  the  blowup  is  local ly  given  by  Cˆ2  = {(x, �) ∈ C2  × CP1 |x ∈ �}. 
The  idea  of  this  theorem  is  to  look  at  approximately  holomorphic  sections  s, s�  ∈  C∞ (L⊗k )  s.t.  s/s�  is  an 
”approximately meromorphic”  function  and  has  nondegenerate  critical  points.

3.  Symplectic  Sums  (Gompf  1994) 
Deﬁnition  3.  A  symplectic  sum  is  a  connected  sum  along  a  codimension  2  symplectic  submanifold. 
Explicitly,  for  Q2n−2  ⊂  (M 2n , ω)  a  compact,  symplectic  submanifold,  N Q  = (T Q)⊥  is  a  rank  2  symplectic 
vector  bundle  over Q.  Putting  a  compactible  complex  structure  on  it  gives  c1 (N Q) ∈ H 2 (Q, Z).  Assume N Q  is 
trivial,  so  c1 (N Q) = 0  (i.e.  it  has  a  nonvanishing  section). 
Example.  For  n = 2,  c1  is  precisely  the  degree  of  the  line  bundle,  and  deg  (N Q) = [Q]
of  a  section  of  N Q  are  obtained  by  deforming  Q  to  Q�  and  intersecting  them. 
Now, by the symplectic tubular neighborhood theorem, we have a neighborhood of Q in M  symplectomorphic 
∼  Q × D2 (�)  s.t.  φ∗ω  and  (ω
to  (Q × D2 (�), ω Q ⊕ ω0 ).  Idea:  use  exponential maps  to  identify  φ  : v(Q)

|Q ⊕ ω0 ) 
agree  on  Q × {0},  and  use  local Moser  to  produce  a  local  symplectomorphism  to  identify  to  two  forms.
