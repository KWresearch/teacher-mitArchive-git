1.  Hamiltonian  Vector  Fields 
Recall  from  last  time  that,  for  (M , ω)  a  symplectic  manifold,  H  :  M  →  R  a  C∞  function,  there  exists  a 
vector  ﬁeld  XH  s.t.  iXH 
ω  =  dH .  Furthermore,  the  associated  ﬂow  ρt  of  this  vector  ﬁeld  is  an  isotopy  of 
symplectomorphisms.

Example.  Consider  S 2  ⊂  R
usual area  form).  Then setting H  = z  gives the vector ﬁeld  ∂  :  the associated ﬂow  is precisely rotation by angle 
∂ θ 
t. 

Note  also  that  the  critical  points  of H  are  the  ﬁxed  points  of  ρt , and  ρt  preserves  the  level  sets  of  H ,  i.e.

One  can  apply  this  to  obtain  the  ordinary  formula  for  conservation  of  energy. 
Deﬁnition  1.  X  is  a  symplectic  vector  ﬁeld  if  LX ω = 0,  i.e.  iX ω  is  closed.  X  is  Hamiltonian  if  iX ω  is  exact. 
By  Poincar´e,  we  see  that,  locally,  symplectic  vector  ﬁelds  are  Hamiltonian.  Globally,  we  obtain  a  class 
[iX ω ] ∈ H 1 (M , R). 
Example.  On  T 2 ,  ∂x  and  ∂ y  are  symplectic  vector  ﬁelds:  since  dy  and  dx  are  not  exact,  ∂x  and  ∂ y  are  not

Hamiltonian. 
Now  consider  time-dependent  Hamiltonian  functions,  i.e.  C∞  maps  R × M  →  R, (t, x)  (cid:7)
→  Ht (x). 
Let
Ham(M , ω)  denote  the  space  of  Hamiltonian  diﬀeomorphisms  on  ω ,  i.e.  the  set  of  diﬀeomorphisms  ρ  s.t.  ∃Ht 
with  corresponding  ﬂow  ρt  satisfying  ρ1  = ρ. 
Remark.  The Arnold  conjecture  states  that  for M  compact,  φ ∈ Ham(M , ω) with  nondegenerate  Fix(φ)  (i.e.  at 
a ﬁxed point  p,  dφ(p) − id  is  invertible),

This  statement  is  false  for  non-Hamiltonian  vector  ﬁelds,  as  seen  in  the  case  of  ∂  on  a  torus.

We  can  measure  the  diﬀerence  between  symplectomorphisms  and  Hamiltonian  symplectomorphisms  via  the

In  general,  the  ﬂux  depends  on  the  homotopy  class  of  the  path  from  the  identity  to  ρ1 . 
Remark.  The  Flux  conjecture  concerns  the  integral  of  the  ﬂux  on  π1Symp(M , ω),  i.e.  the  nature  of

Geometrically,  for  γ  :  S 1  →  M  a loop,  let  γt  =  ρt  ◦ γ  :  S 1  →  M  be  the  image  of  γ  under  ρ  and  deﬁne

2.  Moser’s  Theorem 
One  can  ask  whether,  for  a  given  manifold  M ,  two  symplectic  structures  ω0 , ω1  are  equivalent,  i.e.  whether 
there  is  a  symplectomorphism  M  →  M  which  pulls  back  one  to  the  other.  In  general,  [ω0 ] = [ω1 ] does not 
imply  that  the  two  structures  are  symplectomorphic.  To  study  this  question  further,  we  give  other  notions  of 
equivalence. 
Deﬁnition  2.  Two  forms  ω0 , ω1  are  deformation  equivalent  if  ∃(ωt )t∈[0,1]  a  continuous  family  of  symplectic 
forms,  and  isotopic  if  there  is  such  a  family  with  [ωt ]  constant  in  H 2 (M , R). 
Remark.  There  exist  pairs  of  symplectic  forms  with  the  same  cohomology  class  which  are  not  deformation 
equivalent,  as  well  as  pairs  which  are  deformation  equivalent  but  not  isotopic  (in  dimension ≥ 6). 
Let  M  be  a  compact  manifold  with  ω0 , ω1  isotopic  symplectic  forms  (i.e.  ∃ωt  as  above  with  each  ωt  nonde­
generate). 
Theorem  1  (Moser).  ∃  an  isotopy  ρt  : M  → M  s.t.  ρ∗ 
ωt  = ω0 .

That  is,  (M , ω0 ) and  (M , ω1 )  are  symplectomorphic. 
Proof.  (This  technique  is known as Moser’s  trick.)  By assumption,  [ωt ]  is  independent of  t,  i.e.  [ dωt  ] = 0.  Thus, 
∃αt  a  1-form  s.t.  dt  = −dαt :  moreover,  we  can  choose  this  αt  smoothly  w.r.t.  to  t  (via  the  Poincar´e  lemma).

Since  ωt  is  nondegenerate,  ∃Xt  s.t.  iXt 
ωt  =  αt .  Moreover,  since  M  is  compact,  we  have  a  well-deﬁned  ﬂow  ρt

of  Xt . Now,

Since  ρ0  is  the  identity,  we  have  our  desired  isotopy. 
Example.  For  symplectic  forms  ω0 , ω1  with  [ω0 ] = [ω1 ],  consider  the  family  ωt  = tω0 + (1 − t)ω1 . By  the  above, 
if  this  family  is  nondegenerate,  the  two  forms  are  symplectomorphic.  In  general,  there  is  no  reason  for  this 
to  be  true:  in  dimension  2,  it  always  is.  More  generally,  this  follows  from  compatibility  with  almost-complex 
structures.

Theorem  2  (Darboux).  For  (M , ω)  symplectic,  p  ∈  M ,  ∃U  (cid:12)  p  with a coordinate system  (x1 , y1 , . . . , xn , yn ) 
s.t.  ω |U  = 
dxi  ∧ dyi . 
� 
Proof.  (TpM , ωp ) has a standard basis (e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fn ), so there exist  local coordinates (x1 , y1 , . . . , xn , yn ) 
dxi  ∧ dyi . On  a  neighborhood  U  of  p,  we  obtain  two  symplectic  forms:  ω  and  the  standard  form. 
s.t.  ωp  = 
The  family  ωt  = (1 −  t)ω0  +  tω1  is  one  of  closed  forms:  since  nondegeneracy  is  an  open  condition,  we  can 
shrink  our  neighborhood  to  assure  that  ωt  is  nondegenerate  for  each  t  on  some  U (cid:5)  (cid:12)  p. Thus,  ∃α ∈ Ω1 (U ) s.t. 
ω1  − ω0  = −dα.  Subtracting  a  constant,  we  can  assume  αp  = 0.  Let  vt  be  the  vector  ﬁeld  on  U  s.t.  ivt 
ωt  = α. 
Then  ∃U (cid:5)(cid:5)  (cid:12)  p  s.t.  its  ﬂow  ρt  is  deﬁned  ∀t.  By  the  Moser’s  trick,  we  fnd  that  ρ∗ 
1ω1  =  ω0 ,  implying  that  the 
� 
symplectic  form  is  indeed  standard  after  composing  our  chosen  coordinates  with  ρ1 .
