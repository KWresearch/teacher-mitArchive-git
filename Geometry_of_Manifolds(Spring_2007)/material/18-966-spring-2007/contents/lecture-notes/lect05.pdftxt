Let  M  be  a  compact  manifold,  (ωt )  symplectic  forms,  [ωt ]  constant  = ⇒  (M , ω0 )  ∼=

Theorem  2  (Darboux).  Local ly,  any  symplectic  manifold  is  local ly  isomorphic  to  (R2n , ω0 ). 

1.  Tubular  Neighborhoods 
Let M n  ⊃ X k  be a submanifold with inclusion map i.  Then we get a map dx i : TxX �→ TxM , with associated 
normal  space  NxX  = TxM /TxX .  Note  that  if  there  is  a metric,  one  can  identify  this with  the  orthogonal  space 
to X  at  x.  Putting  all  these  spaces  together, we  get  a  normal  bund le  N X  = {(x, v)|x ∈ X, v ∈ NxX } with  zero 
section  i0  : X  → N X, x  �→ (x, 0). 
Theorem  3.  ∃U0  a  neighborhood  of  X  in  N X  (via  the  0-section)  and  U1  a  neighborhood  of  X  in  M  s.t. 
∼  U1  a  diﬀeomorphism.

Proof.  (Idea)  Equip  M  with  a  Riemannian  metric  g ,  so  NxX 
for  |v |  suﬃciently  small  (|v | = 
g(v , v) < �), we  obtain  an  exponential  function  expx (v)  (deﬁned by  considering 
a  small  geodesic  segment with  origin x  and  tangent  vector  v).  We  obtain  a map U0  → M , (x, v)  �→ exp (v).  For 
x ∈ X, T(x,0) (N X ) = TxX ⊕ NxX  and

d(x,0) exp(u, v) = u + v ∈ TxX ⊕ TxX ⊥

this  giving  us  a  local  diﬀeomorphism  near  the  0-section.  Thus,  locally  on  some  neighborhood  of  the  0-section 
� 
in  N X ,  exp  induces  a  diﬀeomorphism  onto  exp(U0 ) =  neighborhood  of  X  in M . 
Let  U1  =  {expx (v)| |v |  < �� (x)} ⊂  M  be  a  tubular  neighborhood  of  X  in  M  as  constructed  above,  with 
U0  ⊂ N X  the  corresponding  neighborhood  of  the  zero  section.  Via  the  pro jection  π  : U0  → X , whose  ﬁbers  are

balls  in  Rn−k ,  we  see  that  U1  retracts  onto  X ,  i.e.  we  have  a  null-homotopic  map  U1

Corollary  1.  i∗  : H ∗ (U1 , R)  H ∗ (X, R)  is  an  isomorphism. 
Proposition  1.  β  ∈ Ω� (U ), dβ  = 0, i∗β  = β |X  = 0  =⇒ ∃µ ∈ Ω�−1 (U ), β  = dµ  and  µx  = 0  ∀x ∈ X .

That  is,  we  have  a  symplectomorphism  (U0 , ω0 ) 
Proof.  Let U0  be  a  tubular  neighborhood  of X .  Since ω1 − ω0  is  closed  and  is  0  on X ,  by  the  above  proposition 
we  have  a  form  µ ∈ Ω1 (U0 )  s.t.  ω1  − ω0  = dµ  and  µ  is  0  along  X .  Now,  let  ωt  =  (1 − t)ω0  + tω1 :  these  form  a 
family of  closed  two-forms which are ω0  along X  and  thus nondegenerate at X .  Since nondegeneracy  is an open

Theorem  5  (Weinstein’s Lagrangian Neighborhood).  Let  (M , ω)  be  a  symplectic manifold,  i : X � M  a  closed

Now,  let  ω0  be  the  canonical  form  on  T ∗X  and  ω1  = ψ∗ω .  These  are  both  sympectic  forms  on  N0  ⊂ T ∗X  s.t. 
the  zero  section  X  is  Lagrangian  for  both. 
We  claim  that  we  can  build  (canonically)  a  family  of  isomorphisms  Lp  :  TpN0  →  TpN0  for  p  ∈  X  s.t.

(Idea:  use a Riemannian metric, and set h(p, ξ ) = expp,0 Lp (0, ξ )).  Then ∀p ∈ X, (h∗ω1 )p  = (ω0 )p ,  so we can use 
∼ 
local  Moser  for  h∗ω1  and  ω0 .  We  therefore  obtain  U0 , U1  ⊃  X  and  a  local  symplectomorphism  f  : (U0 , ω0 )

(U1 , h∗ω1 ).  Setting  φ = ψ ◦ h ◦ f  gives  us  the  desired  result.
