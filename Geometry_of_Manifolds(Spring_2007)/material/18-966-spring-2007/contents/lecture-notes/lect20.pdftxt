Proof.  For  this,  we  use  the Weitzenbock  formula  for

�k  = ∂ ∂

where  ∂  is  induced  by  �  on  L⊗k .  We  ﬁx  p ∈ M  and  work  in  a  neighborhood  with  p  identiﬁed  with  the  origin,

Using  parallel  transport  w.r.t.  the  Levi-Cevita  connection  in  the  radial  directions,  we  still  have  these  frames

1.  Counterexamples 
⇒
We know now that K ahler  = 
complex and symplectic, while both imply the existence of an almost-complex 
structure,  and  the  latter  implies  that  the  manifold  is  even-dimensional  and  orientable.  In  dimension  2,  these 
are  all  the  same:  in  dimension  4,  all  these  inclusions  are  strict  (even  when  restricting  to  compact  manifolds). 
S 4  is  even-dimensional  and  orientable,  but  not  almost-complex:  if  it  were,  c1 (T S 4 , J )  ∈
• 
Example. 
[S 4 ] = 2c2  − p1  = 2χ + 3σ  (with  χ  the  Euler  characteristic  and  σ  the 
1  · 
H 2 (S 4 , Z) =  0  would  satisfy  c2 
signature),  which  is  impossible.  Similarly,  CP2#CP2  is  not  almost-complex: 
c1  = (a, b) ∈ H 2  ∼
= ⇒  2 
c1  · 
[CP2#CP2 ] = a 2  + b2  = 2
= Z2 
χ + 3σ = 14 
which  is  again  impossible. 
•	 CP2#CP2#CP2  is almost-complex,  but not  symplectic or  complex:  Ehresman-Wu  implies  that ∃J  with 
c1  =  c  ∈  H 2 (M , Z)  ⇔  c2  · [M ] = 2χ + 3σ  and  ∀x  ∈  H2 , �c, x� ≡  Q(x, x)  mod  2.  In  our  case,  χ  = 5 
and  σ = 3,  so  the  calculation  works  out.  By  the  Kodaira  classiﬁcation  of  surfaces,  if  it  were  complex  it 
would  be  K¨ahler;  by  Taubes’  (1995)  theorem  on  Seiberg-Witten  invariants,  it  is  not  symplectic. 
•	 The Hopf  surface  S 3  × S 1  ∼
= (C2  � {0})/Z  is  complex  (Z-action  (z1 , z2 )  �→ (λn
z2 )  is  holomorphic) 
z1 , λn
but  not  symplectic  (H 2  = 0). 
•	 Not all  symplectic manifolds have  complex  structure  (compatible or otherwise).  For  the  former case, we 
have  examples  of  torus  bundles  over  tori;  for  the  latter  case,  we  have  the  following  theorem. 
Theorem  1  (Gompf  1994).  ∀G  ﬁnitely  presented  group,  ∃M 4  compact,  symplectic,  but  not  complex 
with  π1 (M 4 ) ∼= F . 
This  construction  is  obtained  by  performing  symplectic  sums  along  codimension  2  symplectic  sub-
manifolds.  Since

(11) 

H1 (M , Z) = Ab(π1 (M )) = Ab(G) = G/[G, G] 
∼
M  is  not  K ahler  if  this  has  odd  rank  (since  H 1  =  H 1,0  ⊕ H 0,1 ,  with  the  two  parts  having  the  same 
rank).  Using  the  Kodaira  classiﬁcation,  one  can  arrange  to  obtain  non-complex manifolds  as  well. 
•	 The  Kodaira-Thurston manifold M  = R4 /Γ,  where  Γ  is  the  discrete  group  generated  by

g1  : (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )  �→ (x1  + 1, x2 , x3 , x4 )

g2  : (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )  �→ (x1 , x2  + 1, x3  + x4 , x4 )

g3  : (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )  �→ (x1 , x2 , x3  + 1, x4 ) 
g4  : (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )  �→ (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4  + 1) 
is  complex  and  symplectic,  but  not  K¨ahler.  Note  that  Γ ⊂  Symp(R4 , ω0 )  (obvious  for  the  three  trans­
∗ω0  =  dx1  ∧ d(x2  + 1) + d(x3  + x4 ) ∧ dx4  =  dx1  ∧ dx2  + dx3  ∧ dx4  as  desired),  so  M  is 
lations,  while  g2 
symplectic.  M  is  also  a  symplectic  T 2  bundle  over  T 2 ,  with  the  base  given  by  x1 , x2  and  the  ﬁber  by 
x3 , x4  (with  the bundle  trivial along  the x1  direction, nontrivial along  the x2  direction with monodromy 
(x3 , x4 )  �→ (x3  + x4 , x4 )).
