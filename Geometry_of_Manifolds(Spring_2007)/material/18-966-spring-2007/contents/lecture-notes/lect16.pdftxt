SYMPLECTIC  GEOMETRY,  LECTURE  16

Recall  that we were  in  the midst  of  elliptic  operator  analysis  of  the Laplace-deRham  operator Δ = (d + d∗ )2 . 
We  claimed  that  Δ  was  an  elliptic  operator,  i.e.  it  has  an  invertible  symbol  σ(ξ ) = − |ξ | 2  id.  We  stated  that  a

diﬀerential  operator  L : C∞ (E )  C∞ (F )  of  order  k  extends  to  a  map  Ls  : W s (E )  W s−k (F ).

Deﬁnition  1.  For  L  :  Γ(E ) 
Γ(F )  a  diﬀerential  operator,  P  :  Γ(F ) 
Γ(E )  is  cal led  a  parametrix  (or
pseudoinverse)  if  L P  −  idE  and  P L  −  idF  are  smoothing  operators,  i.e.  they  extend  continuously  to

W s (E )  W s+1 (E ). 
The  following  results  can  be  found  in Wells’  book. 
Theorem  1.  Every  el liptic  operator  has  a  pseudoinverse.

Corollary  1.  ξ  ∈ W s (E ), L  el liptic,  Lξ  ∈ C∞ (F ) = ⇒  ξC∞ (E ).

⇒
Theorem  2.  L  el liptic  =  Ls  is  Fredholm,  i.e.  Ker  Ls , Coker  Ls  are  ﬁnite  dimensional,  Im  Ls  is  closed,  and

Ker  Ls  = Ker  L ⊂ C∞ (E ).

Theorem  3.  L  el liptic,  τ  ∈ (Ker  L∗ )⊥  = Im  L ⊂ C∞ (F ) =⇒ ∃!ξ  ∈ C∞ (E )  s.t.  Lξ = τ  and  ξ ⊥ Ker  L.

Theorem  4.  L  el liptic,  self-adjoint  =⇒ ∃HL , GL  : C∞ (E ) → C∞ (E )  s.t.

(3)  GL
(4)  C∞ (E ) = Ker  L ⊕⊥L2  Im  (L ◦ GL ). 
We  now  return  to  the  case  of Δ = (d + d∗ )2  on  a  compact manifold. 
Corollary  2.  ∃G  : Ωk  → Ωk  and  H  : Ωk  → Hk  = Ker  Δ  s.t.  GΔ = ΔG =  id − H  and  Im  (GΔ) = (Hk )⊥ . 
Corollary  3.  Ωk  = Hk  ⊕⊥L2  Im  d ⊕⊥L2  Im  d∗ . 
Remark.  Every  α ∈ Ωk  decomposes  as  α = H α + d(d∗Gα) + d∗ (dGα). 
Using  this  decomposition,  we  immediately  obtain  the  theorem 
Theorem  5  (Hodge).  For  M  a  compact,  oriented  Riemannian  manifold,  every  cohomology  class  has  a  unique 
harmonic  representative. 
From  now  on,  M  is  a  compact,  K¨ahler  manifold,  with  the  Hodge  ∗  operator  on  Ω∗ (M )  extended  C-linearly

to  C-valued  forms.

Let  L  : Ωp,q  →  Ωp+1,q+1  be  the  map  α  �→  ω ∧ α, L∗  : Ωp,q  →  Ωp−1,q−1  the  adjoint  map  α  �→  (−1)p+q  ∗ L∗. 
Furthermore,  set  dC  =  J −1dJ  = (−1)k+1J dJ ,  with  adjoint  d∗  =  J −1d∗J  = (−1)k+1J d∗J .  On  functions,  we 
C 
have  that 
dc f  = −J df  = −J (∂ f  + ∂ f ) = −i∂ f  + i∂ f  = −i(∂ − ∂ )f 
(3) 
which  extends  to  higher  forms  as  well.  Thus,  ddC  = −i(∂ + ∂ )(∂ − ∂ ) = 2i∂ ∂ . 
Lemma  1.  For  X  K¨ahler,  [L, d] = 0, [L∗ , d∗ ] = 0,  [L, d∗ ] = dC , [L∗ , d] = −d∗ 
C . 
Proof.  The  ﬁrst  part  follows  from  d(α ∧ ω) = dα ∧ ω .  For  the  second,  see Wells,  theorem  4.8. 
Proposition  2.  ΔC  = J −1ΔJ  = dC d∗  + d∗  dC  = Δ

Proof.  By  J -invariance  of  ω ,  we  have  that  [L, J ] = [L∗ , J ]  =  0.  Using  the  above  identities,  we  have  that 
[L∗ , dC ] = d∗ ,  so 
Δ = dd∗  + d∗d = d[L∗ , dC ] + [L∗ , dC ]d = dL∗dC  − ddC L∗  + L∗dC d − dC L∗d 
(4) 
Conjugating  by  J  simply  swaps  terms,  since  ddC  = −dC d.

The  proof  that  each  ∂ -cohomology  class  contains  a  unique  �-harmonic  form  is  similar  to  that  of  the  Hodge 
theorem  in  the  Riemannian  case. 
Theorem  7.  Δ = 2� = 2�. 
Proof.  By  the  ﬁrst  lemma,  d∗dc  =  d∗ [L, d∗ ] =  d∗Ld∗  =  −[L, d∗ ]d∗  =  −dC d∗ .  Moreover,  dc  =  −i(∂  − ∂ ),  so
