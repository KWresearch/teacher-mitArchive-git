1.  Existence  of  Almost-Complex  Structures 
Let  (M , ω)  be  a  symplectic  manifold.  If  J  is  a  compatible  almost-complex  structure,  we  obtain  invariants 
cj (T M , J ) ∈ H 2j (M , Z)  of  the  deformation  equivalence  class  of  (M , ω). 
Remark.  There  exist  4-manifolds  (M 4 , ω1 ),  (M 4 , ω2 )  s.t.  c1 (T M , ω1 ) =�
c1 (T M , ω2 ). 
We  can  use  this  to  obtain  an  obstruction  to  the  existence  of  an  almost-complex  structure  on  a  4-manifold: 
note  that we  have  two Chern  classes  c1 (T M , J ) ∈ H 2 (M , Z)  and  c2 (T M , J ) = e(T M ) ∈ H 4 (M , Z) ∼= Z  if M 4  is 
closed,  compact.  Then  the  class 
(1 + c1  + c2 )(1 − c1  + c2 ) − 1 = −c 2  + 2c2  = c2 (T M  ⊕ T M , J ⊕ J ) = c2 (T M  ⊗R  C, i)
1 
is  independent  of  J . 
More  generally,  for  E  a  real  vector  space  with  complex  structure  J ,  we  have  an  equivalence  (E ⊗R  C, i)  ∼= 
E ⊕E  = (E , J )⊕(E , −J ).  Indeed, J  extends C-linearly to an almost complex structure JC  which is diagonalizable 
with  eigenvalues  ±i.  Applying  this  to  vector  bundles,  we  obtain  the  Pontrjagin  classes 
p1 (T M ) = −c2 (T M  ⊗R  C) ∈ H 4 (M , Z) ∼= Z

for  a  4-manifold M . 

· 
Theorem  1.  p1 (T M ) [M ] = 3σ(M ),  where  σ(M )  is  the  signature  of M  (the  diﬀerence  between  the  number  of 
positive  and  negative  eigenvalues  of  the  intersection  product  Q : H2 (M ) ⊗ H2 (M ) → Z, [A] ⊗ [B ]  �→ [A ∩ B ]  dual 
to  the  cup  product  on  H 2 ). 
1  · 
[M ] = 2χ(M ) + 3σ(M ).
Corollary  1.  c2 
→ 
Remark.  Under the map H 2 (M , Z)  H 2 (M , Z/2Z), the Chern class c1 (T M , J ) gets sent to the Stiefel-Whitney 
class  w2 (T M ).  This means  that 
c1 (T M ) [A] ≡ Q([A], [A])  mod 2  ∀[A] ∈ H2 (M , Z)

Theorem  2.  ∃  an  almost  complex  structure  J  on  M k  s.t.  α = c1 (T M , J ) ∈ H 2 (M , Z)  iﬀ  α  satisﬁes 
[M ] = 2χ + 3σ  and  α  [A] ≡ Q([A], [A])  mod 2  ∀[A] ∈ H2 (M , Z)

Examples: 
•	 On  S 4 ,  if  J  were  an  almost  complex  structure,  then  c1 (T S 4 , J )  ∈  H 2 (S 4 )  =  0..  However,  χ(S 4 ) = 2 
·
· 
and  σ(S 4 ) = 0, so 2  2 + 3  0 cannot be  c1
2 ,  and  thus  there  is  no  almost  complex  structure. 
•	 On CP2 , we have H2 (CP2 , Z) = Z generated by [CP1 ] with intersection product Q([CP1 ], [CP1 ]) = 1 (the 
, Z) ∼
= Z2  has 
number  of  lines  in  the  intersection  of  two  planes  in  C3 .  By Mayer-Vietoris,  H2 (CP2#CP2 
intersection  product  Q =  I2×2  = ⇒  σ  =  2  and  Euler  characteristic  χ =  4.  Now,  assume  c1 (T M , J ) = 
(a, b) ∈ H2 (M , Z):  if  there  were  an  almost  complex  structure, 
a 2  + b2  = c1
2  = 2χ + 3σ = 14

2.  Types  and  Splittings 
Let  (M , J )  be  an  almost  complex  structure,  J  extended  C-linearly  to  T M  ⊗ C = T M 1,0  ⊕ T M 0,1  (with  the 
decomposition  being  into  +i  and  −i  eigenspaces).  Here,  T M 1,0  = {v − iJ v |v  ∈ T M }  is  the  set  of  holomorphic 
tangent  vectors  and  T M 0,1  =  {v + iJ v , v  ∈  T M }  is  the  set  of  anti-holomorphic  tangent  vectors.  For  instance,

respectively.  More  generally,  we  have  induced  real  isomorphisms

π1,0  : T M  → T M 1,0 , v  �→ v 1,0  = 
(v − iJ v), π0,1  : T M  → T M 0,1 , v  �→ v 0,1  =

Then  (J v)1,0  = i(v1,0 ), (J v)0,1  = −i(v0,1 ),  so  (T M , J ) ∼
= T M 1,0  ∼
= T M 0,1  as  almost-complex  bundles. 
Similarly, the complexiﬁed cotangent bundle decomposes as T ∗M 1,0  = {η ∈ T ∗M ⊗C|η(J v) = iη(v)}, T ∗M 0,1  = 
{η ∈ T ∗M  ⊗ C|η(J v) = −iη(v)},  with maps  from  the  original  cotangent  bundle  given  by

For  Cn ,  we  ﬁnd  that 
J ∗dxi  = dyi , J ∗dyi  = −dxi  = ⇒  dxj  + idyj  = dzj  ∈ (T ∗Cn )1,0 , dxj  − idyj  = dzj  ∈ (T ∗Cn )0,1 
(9) 
More  generally,  on  a  complex  manifold,  in  holomorphic  local  coordinates,  we  have  T ∗M 1,0  =  Span(dzj ).  Note 
also  that  T ∗M 1,0  pairs  with  T M 0,1  trivially.

2.1.  Diﬀerential  forms.  Ωk  splits  into  forms  of  type  (p, q),  p + q = k ,  with 
∧p,q T ∗M  = (∧pT ∗M 1,0 ) ⊗ (∧q T ∗M 0,1 ) =

Deﬁnition  1.  For  α ∈ Ωp,q (M ),  ∂α = (dα)p+1,q  ∈ Ωp+1,q  and  ∂α = (dα)p,q+1  ∈ Ωp,q+1 .

For a function, we have df  = ∂ f + ∂ f .  Now,  say f  : M  → C  is J -holomorphic  if ∂ f  = 0 ⇔ df  ∈ Ω1,0  ⇔ df (J v) = 
idf (v). 
2.2.  Dolbeault  cohomology.  Assume  d  maps  Ωp,q  →  Ωp+1,q  ⊕ Ωp,q+1 ,  i.e.  d  =  ∂ + ∂ .  On  Cn ,  for  instance,

we  have

Then,  ∀β  ∈ Ωp,q , 0 = d2β  = ∂ ∂β + ∂ ∂β + ∂ ∂β + ∂ ∂β  = ⇒  ∂ 2  = 0, ∂ 2  = 0, ∂ ∂ + ∂ ∂  = 0.  Since  ∂ 2  = 0, we  obtain

In  general,  this  is  not  ﬁnite-dimensional.  We’ll  see  that  on  a  compact  K¨ahler  manifold,  i.e.  a  manifold  with 
compatible  symplectic  and  complex  structures, H k (M , C) = 
p+q=k H p,q (M ).

2.3.  Integrability.  Let  (M , J )  be  a  manifold  with  almost-complex  structure.

Deﬁnition  3.  The  Nijenhuis  tensor  is  the  map  N (u, v) = [J u, J v ] − J [u, J v ] − J [J u, v ] − [u, v ]  for  u, v  vector

ﬁelds  on  M . 
In  fact,  N (u, v) = −8Re([u1,0 , v1,0 ])0,1 .
