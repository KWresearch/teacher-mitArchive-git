1.  Homology  and  Cohomology 
Recall  from  last time that,  for M  a smooth manifold, we produced a graded diﬀerential algebra (Ω∗ (M ), ∧, d) 
giving  us  a  cohomology  H ∗ (M )  with  cup  product  [α] ∪ [β ] = [α ∧ β ]  (which  is  well-deﬁned  since  d(α ∧ β ) = 
dα ∧ β + (−1)deg  αα ∧ dβ  and  (α + dη) ∧ β  = α ∧ β + dη ∧ β ).  Furthermore, we  obtain  a  pairing with  homology:

for  Σ ⊂ M  a  p-dimensional,  oriented,  closed  submanifold  with  associated  class  [Σ] ∈ Hp (M ),  we  deﬁne

is  a  consequence  of  Stokes’  theorem:

its  integral  on  submanifolds  depends  only  the  homology  class  of  the  submanifold.

Furthermore,  if M n  is  compact,  closed,  and  oriented,  we  have  a  nondegenerate  pairing 
H p (M , R) ⊗ H n−p (M , R) → R, [α] ⊗ [β ]  �→

2.  Symplectic  Vector  Spaces 

Let  V  be  a  f.d.  vector  space  /R. 
Deﬁnition  1.  A  symplectic  structure  on  V  is  a  bilinear,  non-degenerate,  skew-symmetric  pairing  Ω : V  × V  →
R.  That  is,  as  a  matrix,  it  is  invertible  and  skew-symmetric.

Example.  For  R2n  with  basis  {ei }n 
i=1 , {fi }n
we  have  a  standard  symplectic  form  given  by  Ω0 (ei , ej ) = 
i=1 ,

Ω0 (fi , fj ) = 0  ∀i, j, Ω0 (ei , fj ) = δi,j  = −Ω0 (fj , ei ).  As  a matrix,  it  is  given  by  −

Deﬁnition  2.  For E  ⊂ V  a  linear  subspace,  Ω  a  bilinear  form,  the  orthogonal complement of E  is EΩ  = E⊥  = 
{v ∈ V |Ω(u, v) = 0  ∀u ∈ E }. 
⇔ 
V Ω  = {0}.
Note  that  Ω  is  non-degenerate 
Example.  In  R2n  with  basis  as  above,

Span{e1 , f1 }Ω  = Span{e2 , . . . , en , f2 , . . . , fn } 
Span{e1 , . . . , en }Ω  = Span{e1 , . . . , en } 
Deﬁnition  3.  A  standard  (symplectic)  basis  of  (V 2n , Ω)  is  a  basis  ({ei }, {fi })  satisfying  the  above. 
Theorem  1.  For  (V n , Ω)  a  symplectic  vector  space,  ∃  a  standard  basis.

Proof.  We  induce  on  n:  the  base  case  is  trivial.  Choose  some  vector  e1  ∈  V  �  {0}.  By  nondegeneracy, 
Ω(ei ,  ) = 0  =⇒ ∃f1  s.t.  Ω(e1 , f1 ) = 1.  Let W  = Span{e1 , f1 }Ω :  then Ω W  is  symplectic  since  u ∈ W, Ω(u, q) =

0  ∀w 
∈ 
W  = ⇒  Ω(u, e1 ) = 0, Ω(u, f1 ) = 0  = ⇒  u =  0.  Furthermore,  V 
= Span{e1 , f1 } ⊕ W .  To  see  this,  note 
ﬁrst  that,  if  v  = ae1  + bf1  ∈ W, Ω(e1 , v) = b = 0  and  Ω(f1 , v) = a = 0,  so W  ∩ Span{e1 , f1 } = ∅.  Secondly,  for 
v  ∈  V ,  we  can  write  v  =  w + ae1  + bf1 ,  where  w  =  v − Ω(e1 , v)f1  + Ω(f1 , v)e1  ∈ W .  Since  W  has  dimension 
n − 2,  we  are  done.

Corollary  1.  V  symplectic  =  V  is  even-dimensional  and  symplectomorphic  to  (R2n , Ω0 ).
We  denote  the  symplectic  automorphisms  of  (V , Ω)  by  Sp(V , Ω) = Sp(2n, R).

Deﬁnition  4.  E  ⊂ V  is  a  symplectic  subspace  if  Ω|E  is  nondegenerate,  e.g.  in  a  standard  basis  E  is  the  span 
of 
(e1 , f1 , . . . , ek , fk )

Problem.  Prove  that  E  is  a  symplectic  subspace ⇔ E ∩ E Ω  = {0} ⇔ V  = E ⊕ E Ω . 
Deﬁnition 5.  E  ⊂ V  is an  isotopic (resp.  coisotopic, lagrangian) subspace if E  ⊂ E Ω  (resp.  E Ω  ⊂ E , E Ω  = E ), 
e.g.  in  a  standard  basis  E  is  the  span  of  (e1 , . . . , ek )  (resp.  (e1 , f1 , . . . , ek , fk , ek+1 , . . . en ),  (e1 , . . . , en )). 
Example.  For  E  ⊂ V  Lagrangian  with  basis  (e1 , . . . , en ),  we  can  complete  this  to  a  symplectic  basis 
(e1 , . . . , en , f1 , . . . , fn )

Let M  be  a  smooth manifold. 
Deﬁnition  7.  A  symplectic  form  on  M  is  a  2-form  ω  (i.e.  a  skew-symmetric  pairing  ωp  :  TpM  × TpM 
for  al l  p ∈ M )  which  is  nondegenerate  (i.e.  1  ωn  is  a  volume  form)  and  closed  (i.e.  dω = 0).

Deﬁnition  8.  A  symplectomorphism  is  a  diﬀeomorphism  φ  : (M , ω)
We  denote  the  group  of  symplectomorphisms  of M  by  Symp(M , ω). 
Example.  For  S 2  ⊂  R3 ,  Symp(S 2 )  is  the  group  of  area  and  orientation  preserving  diﬀeomorphisms,  which  is 
much  larger  than  the  group  of  isometries.
