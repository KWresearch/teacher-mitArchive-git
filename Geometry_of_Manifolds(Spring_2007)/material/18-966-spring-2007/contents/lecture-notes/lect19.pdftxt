We  now  return  to  the  complex  K¨ahler  case.  Let  (M , ω , J )  be  a  complex  K¨ahler manifold. 
Proposition  1  (Donaldson).  ∃  a  family  of  sections  (σk,p )k>k0 ,p∈M  which  is  uniformly  bounded  and  almost­
holomorphic,  uniformly  concentrated,  and  satisﬁes  σk,p ≥  c >  0  on  B (p, k−1/2 ).  Furthermore,  ∃  a  family  of 
|
|
|σk,p  − σ˜k,p |
|�σk,p  − �σ˜k,p |
)  ≤  O(exp(−λk1/3 )).  That  is,  the 
holomorphic  sections  ( ˜σk,p )  with  sup 
, sup(k1/2 
σ˜k,p  are  so  close  to  σk,p  that  they’re  interchangeable  in  practice. 
Proof.  Fix p ∈ M  and holomorphic  coordinates  (M , p) → (Cn , 0)  (not necessarily Darboux).  We  can  choose  the 
coordinates  to  be  isometric  at  the  origin. 
(1)  Let u be a local section of L near p which is holomorphic and s.t.  |u(x)| = 1 (e.g.  u ≡ 1 in a holomorphic 
trivialization).  Then

where the L2  estimate on ∂σk,p  follows from the pointwise bound and the observation that it is supported 
in a ball of volume ∼ k−2n/3 .  To get a pointwise C r -estimate on ξ , we use a Cauchy estimate expressing 
values  of  holomorphic  functions  at  q  by  integrals  over  balls  containing  q .  At  points  inside  B (p, k−1/3 ), 
χ = 1 so σk,p  is holomorphic there, as is ξ , and ||ξ ||C r  is controlled by ||ξ ||L2  ∼ exp(−λk1/3 ) on B (k−1/3 ). 
Finally,  the  Cauchy  estimates  for  σk,p  + ξ  imply  that  ||σk,p  + ξ ||C r  is  also  controlled  by  the  local  L2 
norm  and  thus  also  bounded  by  exp(−λk1/3 )  outside  of  B (p, k−1/3 )  as  desired.

This  completes  the  proof. 
Going  from  these  collections  of  sections  to  the  Kodaira  embedding  is  straightforward: 
Well-deﬁnedness:  we need that ∀p, ∃s ∈ H 0 (Lk ) s.t.  s(p) = 0, which comes from the fact that  ˜

σ2 
pro jection  to  a  certain  CP1  factor  of  CPn  which  has  nonzero  derivative  in  the  direction  of  v .  We  could 
do  this  by  looking  at  ˜σk,q± , q±  =  expp (±k−1/2 v).  More  simply,  we  set  σ2  =  σ˜k,p , σ1  obtained  by  a 
similar  process  starting  from  z1σk,p  (rotating  the  coordinates  so  v  is  along  the  z1 -axis)  and  adding  ξ
