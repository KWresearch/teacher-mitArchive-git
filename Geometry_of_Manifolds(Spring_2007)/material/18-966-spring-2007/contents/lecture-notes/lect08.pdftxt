1.  Almost-complex  Structures 
Recall  compatible  triples  (ω , g , J ), wherein  two of  the  three determine  the  third  (g(u, v) = ω(u, J v), ω(u, v) = 
→ 
g(J u, v), J (u) = ˜g−1 ( ˜ω(u))  where  ˜g , ω˜ are  the  induced  isomorphisms  T M 
T ∗M ).
Proposition  1.  For  (M , ω)  a  symplectic  manifold  with  Riemannian  metric  g ,  ∃  a  canonical  almost  complex 
structure  J  compatible  with  ω . 
Idea.  Do  polar  decomposition  on  every  tangent  space.

Corollary  1.  Any  symplectic  manifold  has  compatible  almost-complex  structures,  and  the  space  of  such  struc­
tures  is  path  connected. 
Proof.  For  the  ﬁrst  part,  using  a  partition  of  unity  gives  a  Riemannian  metric,  so  the  rest  follows  from  the 
proposition.  For  the  second  part,  given  J0 , J1 ,  let  gi  =  ω( , Ji ·)  for  i = 0, 1  and  set  gt  =  (1 − t)g0  + tg1 .  Each 
·
of  these  (for  t  ∈  [0, 1])  is  a  metric,  and  gives  an  ω -compatible  J˜t  by  polar  decomposition,  with  J˜0  =  J0  and 
� 
J˜1  = J1 . 
The  mechanism  of  the  proof  also  gives 
Proposition  2.  The  set  J (TxM , ωx )  of  ωx -compatible  complex  structures  on  TxM  is  contractible,  i.e.  ∃ht  : 
J (TxM , ωx ) → J (TxM , ωx )  for  t ∈ [0, 1], h0  = id, h1  = J → J0 , ht (J0 ) = J0∀t. 
Corollary  2.  The  space  of  compatible  almost-complex  structures  on  (M , ω)  is  contractible.  It  is  the  space  of 
sections  of  a  bund le  whose  ﬁbers  are  contractible  by  the  previous  proposition. 
→ 
More  generally,  let  E M  be  a  vector  bundle. 
Deﬁnition  1.  A  metric  on  E  is  a  family  of  positive-deﬁnite  scalar  products  �·, ·�x  :  Ex  × Ex 
→ 
R.  E  is 
symplectic  (resp.  complex)  if  there  is  a  family  of  nondegenerate  skew-symmetric  forms  ωx  : Ex × Ex 
→ 
R  (resp. 
complex  structures  Jx  : Ex  → Ex , Jx 
2  = −1). 
Then metrics  always  exist,  and  every  sympletic  vector  bundle  is  a  complex  vector  bundle  and  vice  versa. 
Proposition  3.  For  (M , J )  an  almost-complex  manifold,  ω0 , ω1  two  symplectic  forms  compatible  with  J ,  ωt  = 
(1 − t)ω0  + tω1  is  symplectic  and  J -compatible  ∀t ∈ [0, 1]  (i.e.  the  space  of  J -compatible  ω  is  convex). 
Note  that 
•	 The  space  of  such  ω  might  be  empty,  as  there  are  almost  complex  manifolds  (like  S 6 )  which  have  no 
symplectic  structures. 
•	 Not  every manifold  has  an  almost-complex  structure  (e.g.  S 4 ,  by  the  Ehresman-Hopf  theorem). 
Problem.  ∃  an  almost-complex  structure ⇔ ∃  a  nondegenerate  2-form. 
The  proposition  works  if  we  put  tame  instead  of  compatible,  i.e.  require  ω(u, J u) >  0  ∀u =  0  but  not 
symmetry. 
Proof.  ωt  is  closed  and  ωt (u, J u) =  (1 − t)ω0 (u, J u) + tω1 (u, J u) >  0  ∀u  �=  0,  so  ωt  is  nondegenerate  and  thus 
symplectic.  Moreover,  gt (u, v) = ωt (u, J v) = (1 − t)g0 (u, v) + tg1 (u, v)  is  a metric.

Deﬁnition 2.  X  ⊂ (M , J ) is an almost-complex submanifold if J (T X ) = T X ,  i.e.  ∀x ∈ X, v ∈ TxX, J v ∈ TxX .

Proposition  4.  If X  is  an  almost-complex  submanifold  in  compatible  (M , ω , J ),  then X  is  symplectic  (i.e.  ω |X

Let  (R2n , Ω0 , J0 , g0 )  be  the  standard  symplectic  structure,  complex  structure,  and metric  on  R2n . 
•	 Sp(2n, R)  is  the  group  of  linear  symplectomorphisms  of  (R2n , Ω0 ),  i.e.  {A  ∈  GL(2n, R)|Ω0 (Au, Av) = 
Ω(u, v)  ∀u, v}. 
•	
GL(n, C)  is  the  group  of  C-linear  automorphisms  of  (R2n , J0 ),  i.e.  {A AJ0  = J0A}.

O(2n)  is  the  group  of  isometries  of  (R2n , g0 ),  i.e.  {A AtA = 1}.

U (n) = GL(n, C) ∩ O(2n). 
• 
Proposition  5.  Sp(2n) ∩ O(2n) = Sp(2n) ∩ GL(n, C) = O(2n) ∩ GL(n, C) = U (n). 
Proof.  The  intersection  of  any  two  of  these  sets  is  the  set  of  automorphisms  preserving  two  of  the  three  in  a 
� 
compatible  triple,  and  thus must  preserve  all  of  them.

•	 The space Ω(V ) of all symplectic structures on V  is ∼
= GL(2n, R)/Sp(2n), as GL(V )
acts  transitively  on  Ω(V )  by  φ  �→ φ∗Ω0  with  stabilizer  Sp(V , Ω). 
•  The  space  J (V )  of  almost-complex  structures  on  V  is  ∼	
= GL(V )/GL(V , J ) ∼
= GL(2n, R)/GL(n, C).
•  The  space  J (V , Ω)  of  Ω-compatible  J ’s  on  V  is  ∼	
= Sp(V , Ω)/Sp(V , Ω) ∩ GL(V , J ) ∼
= Sp(2n, R)/U (n).
•  The  constractibility  of  J (V , Ω)  is  now  the  fact  that  Sp(2n, R)  retracts  onto  its  subgroup  U (n).

for  each  p  ∈  E , x  =  π(p).  Here,  Ex  ⊂  TpE  gives  the  set  of  vertical  directions:  we  would  like  a  splitting 
TpE  =  Ex  ⊕ (TpE )horiz ,  i.e.  a  way  to  transport  from  one  ﬁber  to  another.  The  data  required  to  do  this  is  a 
connection. 
Deﬁnition  3.  A  connection �  on E  is  an R  or C-linear mapping C∞ (M , E ) → C∞ (M , T ∗M ⊗ E ) = Ω1 (M , E )

s.t.  �(f σ) = df  σ + f �σ .  For  v ∈ TxM ,  we  let  �v  denote  the  mapping  σ  �→ �σ(v).

2.1.  Horizontal  Distribution.  Let  σ  :  M E  be  a  section,  dxσ  :  TxM Tσ(x)E  the  induced  map.  Then 
�σ(x) ∈  Tx 
∗M  ⊗ Ex  depends  only  on  dσ(x).  Thus,  we  can  also  think  of  �  as  a  pro jection  π�  :  Tσ(x)E  → Ex , 
with �v σ = π� (dσ(v)).  Then H�  = Ker  π�  is  the  horizontal  subspace  at  p(x). 
Deﬁnition  4.  For  �·, ·�  a  Euclidean  or  Hermitian  metric  on  E ,  �  is  compatible  with  the  metric  if  d�σ, σ � � = 
��σ, σ � � + �σ, �σ � �. 
As  above,  locally  one  can  ﬁnd  an  orthonormal  frame  of  sections  (ei ),  �ei , ej �  =  δi,j .  Writing  �  =  d + A  in 
this  trivialization,  the  compatibility  becomes 
��ξ , η� + �ξ , �η� = �dξ , η� + �Aξ , η� + �ξ , dη� + �ξ , Aη� 
(2)	
Since  d�ξ , η�  =  �dξ , η� + �ξ , dη�,  this  means  that  the  connection  1-form  A  must  be  skew-symmetric  (or  anti-
Hermitian). 
Also  note  that �  on  E  induces  a �∗  on  E ∗  by  d(φ(σ)) = ��∗φ, σ� + �φ, �σ�,  and  similarly  for  E ⊗ F ,  etc.
