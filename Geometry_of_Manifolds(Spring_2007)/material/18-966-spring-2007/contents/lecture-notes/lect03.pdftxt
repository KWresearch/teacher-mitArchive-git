1.  Symplectic  Manifolds 
Let  (M , ω)  be  a  symplectic  manifold,  i.e.  a  smooth manifold  with  nondegenerate  closed  2-form  ω . 
Example.  For  X  a  smooth  manifold,  the  cotangent  bundle  M  =  T ∗X  is  a  symplectic  manifold.  Speciﬁcally, 
� 
given  a  chart  U  ⊂  X  with  coordinates  x1 , . . . , xn ,  we have a basis of  Tp 
∗X  given  by  dx1 , . . . , dxn  and  every 
ξ  ∈ T ∗X  can be written as 
ξidxi .  This  gives  us  a map 
∗ X |U  → R
2n , (x, ξ )  (cid:5)→ (x1 , . . . , xn , ξ1 , . . . , ξn )

ξidxi  on  each  coordinate  patch.  It  is  well-deﬁned  as  a  1-form  on  M , 
Let  α  be  the  Liouville  form  deﬁned  by 
dξi  ∧ dxi  is  the  desired  symplectic  form.  Furthermore,  given  a  diﬀeomorphism  X1  → X2 , we 
and  ω  =  dα = 
have  an  induced map 
→ (f (x), (dx

f )−1∗ ξ )
F  : T

which  is  a  symplectomorphism  (because  ∃  local  coordinates  in  which  f  is  the  identity).  Also,  given  h  ∈ 
C∞ (X, R),  we  have  an  associated  symplectomorphism  τh  : M  → M , (x, ξ )  (cid:5)
→ (x, ξ + dx
h) since 
∗ α = α + dh  =⇒  τh 
∗ ω = τh

as  desired. 
1.1.  Submanifolds. 
Deﬁnition  1.  A  submanifold  W  ⊂  (M , ω)  is  symplectic  if  ω |W  is  symplectic  (speciﬁcal ly,  nondegenerate). 
This  implies  that  TpW  ⊂ TpM  is  a  symplectic  subspace  ∀p.  L ⊂ (M , ω)  is  Lagrangian  if  ω |L  = 0  and  dim  L = 
1 dim  M .

Example.  By  our  above  construction,  the  0-section X (cid:6)→ T ∗X  = M  is  a Lagrangian  submanifold.  Furthermore, 
sections of T ∗X  are graphs Xμ  = {(x, μ(x))|x ∈ X } ⊂ T ∗X  of 1-forms μ ∈ Ω1 (X, R):  such a graph is Lagrangian 
μα = μ  =⇒  i∗ 
iﬀ  dμ = 0,  since  denoting  iμ (x) = (x, μ(x)),  i∗ 
μ (ω) = i∗ 
μ (dα) = di∗ 
μα = dμ. 
Example.  For  Σk  ⊂ X n  a  submanifold,  deﬁne  the  conormal  space  to  x ∈ Σ by 
∗Σ = {ξ  ∈ Tx 
∗ X |ξ |TxΣ  = 0} 
Nx 
(4)	
This  gives  us  subbundle  N ∗Σ ⊂ T ∗X |Σ  and  a  submanifold  N ∗Σ ⊂ T ∗X . For Σ = X , we get  the 0-section:  for 
Σ = {p}, we get  the ﬁber  T ∗X .  By  deﬁnition,  α|N ∗Σ  = 0,  so  N ∗Σ  is  Lagrangian.

1.2.  Symplectomorphisms  and  Lagrangian  Submanifolds.  Let  φ  : (M1 , ω1 ) → (M2 , ω2 )  be  a  diﬀeomor­
phism:  we  want  to  know  whether  φ  is  a  symplectomorphism  as  well,  i.e.  whether  φ∗ω2  =  ω1 . Consider  the 
graph  Γφ  ⊂ M  =  M1  × M2 .  The  latter  space  has  one  symplectic  structure  via  ω  =  ω1  ⊕ ω2  =  π1

However,  here  we  will  consider  the  alternate  symplectic  structure  given  by  ˆω = π1 
Proposition  1.  φ  is  a  symplectomorphism  ⇔ Γφ  is  Lagrangian.

Proof.  Γφ  is  the  image  of  the  embedding  γ  :  M1  → M1  × M2 , p  (cid:5)
ω1  − φ∗ω2  is  0 ⇔ Γφ  is  Lagrangian.

2.  Hamiltonian  Vector  Fields 

Let M  be  a manifold. 
Deﬁnition  2.  An  isotopy  on  M  is  a  C∞  map  ρ  : M  × R → M  s.t.  ρ0  = id  and  ∀t, ρt  is  a  diﬀeomorphism. 
Given  an  isotopy,  we  obtain  a  time-dependent  vector  ﬁeld  vt  :  p  (cid:5)→ d  ρs (q)|
where  q  =  ρ−1 (p).  We  say 
s=t
t 
ds
that  ρt  is  the  ﬂow  of  vt . Conversely,  if M  is  compact  or  vt  is  suﬃciently  ”good”, we  can  integrate  to  obtain  the 
ﬂow from the vector ﬁeld.  If v  is time-independent, we obtain a 1-parameter group ρt  = exp(tv), with associated 
vector  ﬁeld  v .  Recall  the  Lie  derivative  Lv α =  d  (exp(tv)∗α)|
t=0 .

Hamiltonian  function ).  Now, assume that M  is compact, or that the ﬂow of XH  is well-deﬁned.  Then we obtain 
an  isotopy  ρt  : M  → M  of  diﬀeomorphisms  generated  by XH . 
Proposition  3.  ρt  are  symplectomorphisms.
