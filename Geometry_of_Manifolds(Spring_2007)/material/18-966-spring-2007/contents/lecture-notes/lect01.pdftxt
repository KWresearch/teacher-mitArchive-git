Given  M  a  smooth  manifold,  one  has  two  natural  bundles:  the  tangent  bund le  T M  =
the  cotangent  bund le  T ∗M  = {α =  αidxi }.  Under  C∞  maps,  tangent  vectors  pushforward: 
f  : M  → N  = ⇒  f∗ (v) = df (v) ∈ Tf (v)N

Similarly,  diﬀerential  forms  pull  back:  f ∗ (α) = α ◦ df  ∈ Tp

Deﬁnition  2.  The  exterior  diﬀerential  is  the  map  d  : Ωp  Ωp+1  which  maps: 
•	 For  f  a  function,  df  = 
dxi . 
•	 d(f dxi1  ∧ · · · ∧ dxip ) = df  ∧ dxi1  ∧ · · · ∧ dxip . 
∂xi 
d  is  obtained  by  extending  R-linearly  to  al l  of  Ωp . 
Note  that  d  satisﬁes  d(f α) = f dα + df  ∧ α.  The  exterior  derivative  has  the  following  properties: 
•	 d(α ∧ β ) = (dα) ∧ β + (−1)deg  αα ∧ dβ .  In  coordinates, 
d((f dxi1  ∧ · · · ∧ dxip ) ∧ (gdxj1  ∧ · · · ∧ dxjq )) = (f dg + gdf ) ∧ dxi1  ∧ · · · ∧ dxip  ∧ dxj1  ∧ · · · ∧ dxjq 
�  ∂ 2 f

•	 d2  = 0.  For  any  function  f ,

dxi  ∧ dxj  = 0 
∂xj ∂xi 
i,j 
because  terms  with  switched  i, j  cancel. 
These  two  properties  give  us  the  structure  of  a  diﬀerential  graded  algebra  on  Ω∗ (M ) = 
• ∀φ ∈ C∞ (M , N ), α ∈ Ωp (N ), φ∗ (dα) = d(φ∗α). 
Other  operations: 
•	 For  v  ∈  C∞ (T M )  a  vector  ﬁeld,  α  ∈  Ωp (M )  a  form,  we  have  the  interior  product  iv α  =  α(v , · · · )  ∈
Ωp−1 (M ). 
•	 For X  ∈ C∞ (T M ) a vector ﬁeld, f  ∈ C∞ (M ), we have the Lie  derivative  X · f  = LX f  = iX df  = df (X ). 
If  X  generates  diﬀeomorphisms  φt  on M  with  φ0 (x) = x  and  dt φt (x) = X (φt (x)),  then

We  can  extend  this  construction  to  forms:  given α ∈ Ωp (M ), X  ∈ C∞ (T M )  a  vector  ﬁeld, LX α ∈ Ωp  is 
deﬁned  s.t. 

d  ((φt )∗α) = φ∗ 
t (LX α) 
dt
Note  that  the  Lie  derivative  satisﬁes 
LX (α ∧ β ) = LX α ∧ β + α ∧ LX β 

and  LX (dα) = d(LX α). 
Combining  these  two  properties,  we  ﬁnd  that: 
Proposition  1.  LX α = diX α + iX dα. 
Proof.  By  induction:  base  case  is  trivial,  so  assume  statement  for  p-forms.  Locally,  a  (p + 1)  form  is  the  sum  of 
f dα  for  f  ∈ C∞ (M ), α ∈ Ωp .  Thus, 
LX (f dα) = (LX f )dα + f dLX α 
= (iX df )dα + f (ddiX α + diX dα) 
= (iX df )dα + f diX dα 

(9)	

Now, 

(10)	

diX (f dα) + iX d(f dα) = d(f iX dα) + iX (df  ∧ dα) 
= df  ∧ iX dα + f diX dα + (iX df )dα − df  ∧ iX dα 
= (iX df )dα + f diX dα 

giving  us  the  desired  equality.

2.  de  Rham  cohomology 
Deﬁnition  3.  We  say  that  α ∈ Ωp  is  closed  if  dα = 0,  exact  if  α = dβ  for  some  β .  The  de Rham  cohomology 
of  M  is  the  col lection  of  groups

have  that  dη = 0  and  η = dγ  by  our  inductive  hypothesis.  Thus,  α = α�  + dβ  = d(π∗γ + β )  as  desired.

•	 If U  ⊂ M  is a submanifold (e.g.  an open subset), we can deﬁne relative diﬀerential forms Ωp (M , U ; R) = 
{α ∈ Ωp (M , R)|α|U  = 0}  and  obtain  the  relative  de  Rham  cohomology  H p (M , U ; R).

3.  Exact  sequences  of  complexes 
If M  = U  ∪ V ,  U, V  ⊂ M  open,  we  have  an  exact  sequence  on  forms 
0 → Ωp (M ) → ΩP (U ) ⊕ Ωp (V ) → Ωp (U  ∩ V ) → 0 
(14)	
where  the  ﬁrst map  sends  α  �→ (α|U , α|V  )  and  the  second  (α, β ) → α|U ∩V  − β |U ∩V  .  Both  these maps  commute 
with  d,  and  exactness  is  clear:  for  the  surjectivity  of  the  last  map,  use  a  partition  of  unity  1  =  u + v ,  where 
supp(u) ⊂ U, supp(v) ⊂ V ,  so  γ  ∈ Ωp (U  ∩ V )  is  the  image  of  (vγ , −uγ ).  This  short  exact  sequence  then  gives  a 
long  exact  sequence  (called  the Mayer-Vietoris  sequence)

· · · →

(15)	
The map  δ  is  obtained  as  follows: 
Ωp (U ) ⊕ Ωp (V ).

(2)  Given  γ  ∈ Ωp (U  ∩ V )  closed,  dσ(γ
→ 
Ωp+1 (U ) ⊕ Ωp+1 (V ),  and  its 
)  lands  in  the  image  of  i∗  : Ωp+1 (M )
preimage  gives  the  desired  element  of  Ωp+1 (M ). 
Similarly,  for  U  ⊂  M ,  we  get  a  sequence  0  →  Ωp (M , U )  →  Ωp (M )  →  Ωp (U )  →  0,  with  the  maps  given 
by  inclusion  and  restriction  respectively,  and  thus  a  long  exact  sequence  of  relative  cohomology.  Using  these 
properties  along  with  Poincar´e  duality  and  functoriality  under  diﬀeomorphisms,  we  get 
Theorem  1.  The  de  Rham  and  singular  (simplicial)  cohomologies  are  equivalent. 
3.1.  Operations  on  de  Rham  cohomology. 
•	 Cup  product:  [α]  ∪  [β ] = [α  ∧  β ].  This  is  well  deﬁned:  dα  =  dβ  = 0  = ⇒  d(α  ∧  β )  =  0,  and 
(α + dη) ∧ β  = α ∧ β + d(η ∧ β ).

Pairing  with  homology:  for  Σ ⊂ M  a  p-dimensional  submanifold  which  is  oriented  and  closed,  we  have

an  element  [Σ]  ∈  Hp (M )  and  thus  a  pairing  �[α], [Σ]�  =

α.  More  generally,  given  a  p-cycle  [Σ] 
Σ 
linearly.  That  this  is  well-deﬁned  is  a  consequence  of  Stokes’  theorem  �Σ dα =  ∂Σ α. 
niCi ,  with  Ci  p-dimensional  submanifolds  with  ∂ ,  we  get  the  same  pairing  extended 
represented  by 
Poincar´e  duality:  For  M n  compact,  [α]  ∈  H p (M ), [β ]  ∈  H n−p (M )  �→ 
α ∧ β  =  ([α] ∪ [β ])  [M ]  is  a

nondegenerate  linear  pairing  and  gives  an  isomorphism  H n−p  ∼

In  the  noncompact  case,  we  have

α ∧ β  giving H n−p  = Hp .
