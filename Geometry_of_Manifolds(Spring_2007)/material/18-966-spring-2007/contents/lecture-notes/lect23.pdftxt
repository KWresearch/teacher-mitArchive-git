1.  Branched  Covers 
Deﬁnition  1.  For  (M , ω)  a  symplectic  manifold,  p  ∈  M ,  a  local  diﬀeomorphism  φ  :  U  →  Cn  for  U  �  p  is 
ω -tame  if  (φ∗ω)(v , iv)  >  0  ∀v  =�
0  ∈  Cn .  This  is,  φ∗J0  is  ω -tame,  i.e.  complex  lines  in  Cn  give  symplectic 
submanifolds  in  M .

Deﬁnition  2.  A  map  f  : X 4 
is  a  symplectic  branched  covering  if  ∀p  ∈ X, ∃U  �  p, V  �  f (p)  coordinate  neighborhoods  (with  φ  :  U  →  C2  an

is  one  of

(2)  (u, v)  �→ (z1 , z2 ) = (u2 , v)  (simple  branching), 
(3)  (u, v)  �→ (z1 , z2 ) = (u3  − uv , v)  (cusp) 
)  �→ (x
Remark.  Simple  branching  also makes  sense  in  higher  dimensions  as  (x1 , . . . , xn
2 , x2 , . . . , xn ).  Moreover, 
we  could  allow  higher  order  branching,  i.e.  (u, v)  �→ (u , v)  for  p > 2,  but  this  isn’t  generic.

We  can  calculate  these  curves  explicitly  in  local  coordinates.  For  instance,  in  the  case  of  simple  branching, 
2u  0 
= 2u,  so  R = {u = 0}, D = {z1  = 0}.  In  the  case  of  a  cusp,  we
we  have  that  Jac(f ) = det  (df ) =

so  R  =  {v  = 3u2 }  and  D  =  {27z1

2  = 4z2
Ker  df  is  transverse  to  T R  at most  points,  but  not  at  the  cusp. 
Lemma  1.  R  ⊂  X  is  a  smooth,  2-dimensional  submanifold,  and  D  ⊂  Y  is  a  symplectic  submanifold  of  Y 
immersed  except  at  isolated  points  (corresponding  to  cusps).  In  local  coordinates,  D  is  a  complex  curve,  so  T D 
consists  of  complex  lines  and  ωY  |T D  > 0. 
Note  that  the  generic  singularities  of  D  consist  of  two  types:  complex  cusps  and  transverse  double  points 
(with  either  orientation,  i.e.  Tq Y  = T1  ⊕ T2  with  agreeing  or  disagreeing  orientations).

Proposition  1.  If  f  : X 4 
(Y 4 , ωY  )  is  a  symplectic  branched  covering,  then  X  carries  a  symplectic  form  ωX
(canonical  up  to  isotopy)  s.t.  [ωX ] = f ∗ [ωY  ].

Proof.  Note  that  f ∗ωY  is  a  closed  2-form  which  is  nondegenerate  outside  of  R.  ∀p  ∈  R, Kp  =  Ker  dfp  ⊂  TpX 
is  the  kernel  of  f ∗ωY  ,  and  is  a  complex  line  in  local  coordinates  (so  it  carries  a  natural  orientation).  We  claim 
that  ∃α  an  exact  2-form  on  X  s.t.  ∀p  ∈  R, α| >  0  is  positive  nondegenerate.  Assuming  this,  we  have  that 
Kp 
ωX  = f ∗ωY  + �α  for  � > 0  suﬃcient  small  is  closed  and  nondegenerate,  since 
ωX  ∧ ωX  = f ∗ωY  ∧ f ∗ωY  + 2�f ∗ω ∧ α + �2α ∧ α 
(3) 
with  the  ﬁrst  term  ≥  0  everywhere  and  nondegenerate  outside  R,  the  second  term  positive  on  R  (in  local 
coordinates,  f ∗ωY  =  iλ (dv ∧ dv)  for  some  λ > 0,  and  α C×{0}  > 0),  and  the  third  term  negligible  for  small  �.

We  are  left  to  prove  our  claim.  Fix  p  ∈  R,  and  choose  local  coordinates  (u, v)  on  X  of  our  model.  Set 
2 
x  =  Re(u), y  =  Im(u),  and  αp  =  d(χ1 (|u|)χ2 (|v |)xdy),  where  χ1 , χ2  are  cutoﬀ  functions  chosen  s.t.  ∀q  ∈
R ∩ Supp(χ2 ), χ1  ≡ 1.  In  local  coordinates,  we  have  that 
∀(u, v) ∈ R ∩ Supp(χ2 ), αp |K=C×{0}  = χ2 (|v |)dx ∧ dy > 0 
(4) 
and  0  outside  Supp(χ2 ).  Covering R  by  small  neighborhoods,  and  taking  α  to  be  the  sum  of  these  αp  gives  the 
desired  exact  form. 
Finally,  to  see  that  the  choice  of  ωX  is  canonical  up  to  isotopy,  note  that  the  set  of  α’s  satisfying  our  claim 
(i.e.  exact  2-forms  s.t.  α|K  > 0  along R)  is  convex.  That  is, we  can  ﬁnd  an  �  suﬃciently  small  s.t.,  for  two  such 
forms  α1 , α2 ,

approximately-holomorphic  sections:  choosing  three  ”good”  sections,  we  obtain  a  map  f  :  X

Theorem  1.  Every  compact  symplectic  4-manifold  with  integral  2
π [ω ]  can  be  realized  as  a  symplectic  branched

cover  of  CP 2 . 
This  fk  will  look  like  the  local  models  in  coordinates  which  are  ω -tame  on  X  and  ω0 -tame  on  CP 2 ,  and 
∗ω0 ] = k [ω ]  with  ωX  isotopic  to  kω .  Moreover,  if  k  is  large  enough,  then 
applying  the  proposition  to  fk  gives  [fk 
∃  a  preferred  choice  of  fk  : X  → CP 2  up  to  homotopy  among  symplectic  branched  covers. 
Remark.  If  D  is  holomorphic,  then  we  can  lift  J0  to  X ,  i.e.  X  is  a  K¨ahler  manifold  and  f  is  holomorphic. 
Conversely,  if  X  is  not  K¨ahler,  then  the  singular  symplectic  curve  D ⊂ CP2  is  not  isotopic  to  any  holomorphic 
curve.
