The Hodge decomposition  stated  last  time places  strong  constraints  on H ∗  of K¨ahler manifolds,  e.g.  dim  H k 
is  even  for  k  odd  because  C  conjugation  gives  isomorphisms  Hp,q  ∼
= Hq ,p 
(note  that  this  is  false  for  symplectic 
∼
manifolds in general).  The Hodge star ∗ gives isomorphisms Hp,q  → Hn−q ,n−p  and the Hodge  diamond  structure 
on  the  the  ranks  of  the  Dolbeault  cohomology  groups,  i.e.

is  symmetric  across  the  two  diagonal  axes.  Moreover,  note  that  [ω∧p ]  ∈ Hp,p  is  nonzero,  since  [ω∧n ]  is  the 
volume  class. 
We  have  even  stronger  constraints,  namely  the  “hard  Lefschetz  theorem”. 
Theorem  1.  Ln−k  = (· ∧ ωn−k ) : H k (X, R) → H 2n−k (X, R)  is  an  isomorphism.

This  is  false  for  many  symplectic  manifolds.  Moreover,  combining  this  with  Poincar´e  duality  gives  that,  for 
k ≤ n,  H k  × H k  → R,  α, β  �→  α ∪ β ∪ ωn−k  is  a  nondegenerate  bilinear  pairing  (skew-symmetric  if  k  is  odd). 
We  also  have  the  Kodaira  embedding  theorem : 
Theorem  2.  For  (X, ω)  a  compact  K¨ahler  manifold,  [ω ]  ∈  H 2 (X, Z),  ∃  a  projective  embedding  X 
realizing  X  as  a  projective  algebraic  variety. 
We  will  see  a  symplectic  geometry  proof  due  to  Donaldson.

Let  (M , J )  be  a  complex  manifold,  E M  a  complex  vector  bundle.  Then  we  can  cover  M  by  Uα  s.t.  the 
∼ | → 
restrictions  Uα  × Cn  = E
Uα  are  trivial. 
Uα
Deﬁnition  1.  E  is  a  holomorphic  vector  bund le  if  the  transition  functions  φα,β  :  Uα  ∩ Uβ 
holomorphic. 
Note  that  this  only  makes  sense  on  a  complex  manifold.  Now,  ∃  a  natural  ∂  operator  on  sections  given  in  a 
local  trivialization  by  ∂  (given  a  section  s which  looks  like  ξα  in  the  local  trivialization α,  on  an  intersection we 
→ 
have  that  ∂ ξα  = φα,β ∂ ξβ  since  ∂φα,β  = 0).  This  extends  to  ∂  : Ωp,q (E )
Ωp,q+1 (E )  similarly.

(E ) =  Ker  (∂ :Ω0,q (E ) Ω0,q+1 (E ))
Deﬁnition  2.  H q

Specifying  the  holomorphic  structure  on  a  complex  vector  bundle  E  is  equivalent  to  specifying  a  ∂  operator 
with  ∂ 2  =  0.  The  ∂  operator  is  half  of  a  connection:  in  fact,  �  a  connection  on  E  decomposes  into  �  = 
�1,0  + �0,1 . 
Proposition  1.  For  (E , ∂ , |·|)  a  holomorphic  bund le  with  a  Hermitian  metric,  ∃!  Hermitian  connection  s.t. 
�0,1  = ∂ . 
Proof.  We  work  in  local  coordinates  on  M ,  and  local  trivializations  of  E  by  orthonormal  sections  σj  (but  not 
necessarily  holomorphic  trivializations;  ∂σj  may  be  nonzero).  � = d + A  for  A = (aij )  a  matrix-valued  1-form 
(aij  = ��σj , σi �).  �  is  Hermitian  iﬀ  aij  = −aij ,  i.e.  A  is  antihermitian,  and  �  is  holomorphic,  i.e.  �0,1 s = ∂ s 
A1,0  = −(A0,1 )∗ ,  i.e.  a 1,0  = −a 0,1 .	
iﬀ  A0,1  is  given  by  a 0,1  = �∂σj , σi �.  Then  A∗  = −A

Equivalently,  in  a  holomorphic  trivialization, when  ∂  is  the  usual  ∂  operator,  �·, ·�  given  by  h = C∞  function 
d�s, s� � = ��s, s� � +
with values  in positive deﬁnite Hermitian matrices, � = d + A  again  and �  is Hermitian 
⇔ 
�s, �s� � ⇔ d(s∗hs� ) = (ds∗ + s∗A∗ )hs� + s∗h(ds� + As� ) ⇔ dh = A∗h + hA.  On  the  other hand,  now � = ∂ ⇔
0,1
⇔
· 
A0,1  = 0.  Hence  dh = A∗h + hA  A = h−1∂h  (and  A∗  = ∂h  h−1 ).
Proposition  2.  In a holomorphic  frame,  the  connection 1-form A  is of  type  (1, 0),  and ∂A = −A ∧ A, R�  = ∂A 
is  of  type  (1, 1),  and  ∂R = 0  and  ∂R = [R, A]. 
In  fact,  we  have 
Theorem  3.  (E , � = ∂
)2  = 0 ⇔ R0,2  = 0. 
)  is  holomorphic  ⇔ (∂
0,1
Proof.  First,  A = h−1∂h  has  type  (1, 0)  by  the  above,  and 
∂A = ∂ (h−1 ) ∧ ∂h = (−h−1 (∂h)h−1 ) ∧ ∂h = −(h−1∂h) ∧ (h−1∂h) = −A ∧ A 
(2) 
by  the  formula  for derivatives  of  inverses  in  a noncommutative  setting.  Second, R�  = dA + A ∧ A = dA − ∂A = 
∂A,  hence  it  has  type  (1, 1).  Finally,  ∂R = ∂ ∂A = 0, ∂R = ∂ ∂A = −∂ ∂A = ∂A ∧ A − A ∧ ∂A = [R, A].
