1.  Hodge  Theory

Theorem  1  (Hodge).  For  M  a  compact  K¨ahler  manifold,  the  deRham  and  Dolbeault  cohomologies  are  related 
H p,q (M ),  with  H p,q  ∼
by  H k  (M , C) =

Before we discuss this theorem, we need to go over Hodge theory for a compact, oriented Riemannian manifold

(M , g).

Deﬁnition  1.  For  V  an  oriented  Euclidean  vector  space,  the  Hodge  ∗  operator  is  the  linear  map 
n−k  V  which,  for  any  oriented  orthonormal  basis  e1 , . . . , en ,  maps  e1  ∧ · · · ∧ ek  �→ ek+1  ∧ · · · ∧ en . 
Example.  For  any  V ,  ∗(1) = e1  ∧ · · · ∧ en ,  and  ∗∗ = (−1)k(n−k) . 
∗M ,  we  obtain  a  map  on  forms. 
Applying  this  to  Tx

Proposition  1.  d∗  is  the  L2  formal  adjoint  to  the  deRham  operator  d,  i.e.  on  a  compact  closed  Riemannian

Deﬁnition  3.  The  Laplacian  is  Δ = dd∗  + d∗d  : Ωk 
Note  that,  on  Ω∗ (M ) = 
k=0 Ωk (M ), Δ = (d + d∗ )2 .  By  the  adjointness  of  d  and  d∗ ,  we  see  that  Δ  is  a

self-adjoint,  second  order  diﬀerential  operator,  i.e.  �Δα, β �L2  = �α, Δβ �L2 .  Moreover, 
�Δα, α�L2  = �dd∗α, α�L2  + �d∗dα, α�L2  = ||d∗α|| 2  + ||dα|| 2  ≥ 0

Deﬁnition  4.  The  space  of  harmonic  forms  is  the  set  Hk  = {α ∈ Ωk |Δα = 0}. 
We  have  a  natural  map Hk  → H k , α  �→ [α]. 
Theorem  2  (Hodge).  For  M  a  compact,  oriented  Riemannian  manifold,  every  cohomology  class  has  a  unique 
harmonic  representative,  i.e.  Hk  ∼
= H k ,  and  Ωk (M ) = H
k  ⊕L2  d(Ωk−1 ) ⊕L2  d∗ (Ωk+1 ).
Remark.  Clearly  Hk  + d(Ωk−1 )  ⊂  Ker  d  =  (Im  d∗ )⊥  and  Hk  + d∗ (Ωk+1 )  ⊂  Ker  d∗  =  (Im  d)⊥ ,  implying  that 
the  map  Hk  →  H k  is  injective.  Surjectivity  (i.e.  existence  of  harmonic  representatives)  is  more  diﬃcult  and 
requires  elliptic  theory.

Deﬁnition  5.  A  diﬀerential  operator  of  order  k  is  a  linear  map  L : Γ(E ) 
∂ |α| s 
L(s) = 
Aα  ∂xα 
|α|≤k 
where  each  Aα  is  a  C∞  function  with  values  in  matrices,  i.e.  a  local  section  of  Hom(E , F ).  The  symbol  of  L 
� 
is  the  map 
|α|=k 
L  is  elliptic  if  for  every  nonzero  ξ ,  σ(ξ )  is  an  isomorphism. 
Example.  For  instance,  in  local  coordinates,  the  symbol  of  the  Laplacian  is  given  by  σ(ξ ) = − |σ | 2  · id. 
→
Now,  let  L  be  a  diﬀerential  operator  of  order  k :  it  extends  from  L  :  C∞ (E ) 
C∞ (F )  to  Ls  :  W s (E ) 
W s−k (F ).

Deﬁnition  6.  For  L  :  Γ(E ) 
Γ(F )  a  diﬀerential  operator,  P  :  Γ(F ) 
Γ(E )  is  cal led  a  parametrix  (or
pseudoinverse)  if  L P  −  idE  and  P L  −  idF  are  smoothing  operators,  i.e.  they  extend  continuously  to

→ 
W s (E )  W s+1 (E ). 
Using  Rellich’s  lemma  on  embedding  of  Sobolev  spaces,  we  ﬁnd  that 
Theorem  3.  Every  el liptic  operator  has  a  pseudoinverse.

Corollary  1.  ξ  ∈ W s (E ),  L  is  el liplic,  and  Lξ  ∈ C∞ (F ) = ⇒  ξ  ∈ C∞ (E ).

Proof.  Let  P  be  a  parametrix.  Let  S  = P  ◦ L − I ,  so

ξ = P  ◦ Lξ − S ξ 
(9) 
∈ 
Since  the  former  part  lies  in  C∞ (E )  and  the  latter  in  W s+1 (E ),  we  have  that  ξ W s+1 (E ).  Iterating, 
ξ  ∈ C∞ (E ).
