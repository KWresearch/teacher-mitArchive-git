1.  Curvature  and  the  Covariant  Derivative

Let  �  be  a  connection,  R�  ∈ Ω2 (M , End  E )  its  curvature,  where

R� (u, v)s = �u�v s − �v�u s − �[u,v ] s 
(1) 
Last  time,  we  saw  that  in  a  local  trivialization,  �  =  d + A,  where  A  is  a  1-form  with  values  in  End(E ),  and 
R�  = dA + A ∧ A.  Moreover,  a  change  of  basis  given  by  g ∈ C∞ (U, End(E ))  acts  by 
A  �→ g−1Ag + g−1dg , R�  �→ g−1R� g

We  can  extend  the  covariant  derivative  �

Ω1 (M , E )  to  an  operator  d�  : Ωp (M , E )

Proposition  1.  R�  = (d� )2  : Ω0 (M , E ) 
d�  Ω2 (M , E ).  More  general ly, 
d�  Ω1 (M , E ) 
R�  ∧ · = (d� )2  : Ωp (M , E ) → d�  Ωp+1 (M , E ) → d�  Ωp+2 (M , E ) 
(4) 
Proof.  In  a  local  trivialization, 
d� (d�α) = d� (dα + A ∧ α) = d(dα + A ∧ α) + A ∧ (dα + A ∧ α) 
= (dA) ∧ α − A ∧ dα + A ∧ dα + A ∧ A ∧ α = (dA + A ∧ A) ∧ α

Remark.  R�  can  be  thought  of  as  an  obstruction  for  0 
being  a  complex.  If  the 
manifold  is  ﬂat,  i.e.  R�  =  0,  then  we  obtain  a  twisted  de  Rham  cohomology  with  coeﬃcients  in  E .  R�  is 
also  an  obstruction  to  the  integrability  of  the  horizontal  distribution  H� ,  i.e.  homotopy  invariance  of  parallel 
transport. 
When  E  =  T M  for  (M , g)  a  Riemannian  manifold,  there  is  a  unique  metric  (X g(u, v) =  g(�X u, v) + 
· 
g(u, �X v))  connection  on  T M  s.t.  �X Y  − �Y X  = [X, Y ],  called  the  Levi-Cevita  connection.  Now,  let 
(M , ω , g , J )  be  a  symplectic  manifold  with  a  compatible  almost  complex  structure.  Then  T M  is  a  complex 
vector  bundle,  but  �LC  is  not  C-linear  in  general.  Indeed,  it  is  C-linear ⇔ �J  = 0  for  the  induced  connection 
�  on  End(T M ) ⇔ J  is  integrable  (i.e.  an  actual  complex  structure). 
2.  Complex  Vector  Bundles  and  Chern  Classes 
Let  L → M  be  a  complex  line  bundle,  �  a  connection  (possibly  Hermitian  w.r.t.  a  Hermitian  metric  �·, ·�). 
In  a  local  trivialization,  R�  =  dA  ∈  Ω2 (M , C)  (resp.  Ω2 (M , iR))  since  A  ∈  Ω1 (U, C)  (resp.  Ω1 (M , iR))  has 
A ∧ A = 0.  Thus, R�  is a closed 2-form,  and has a corresponding class  c = [R� ] ∈ H 2 (M , C)  (resp.  Ω2 (M , iR)). 
For  ��  another  connection,  we  have  a  global  decomposition  ��  = � + a  for  a  ∈ Ω1 (M , C),  so  R��  = R�  + da 
and  [R� ] = [R�� ].  Thus,  c  is  an  invariant  of L  independent  of �  in H 2 (M , C)  (resp.  H 2 (M , iR)).  Since we  can 
always  choose  a  connection  compatible  with  a  given  Hermitian  form,  we  have

Deﬁnition  1.  The  ﬁrst  Chern  class  of  L  is  c1 (L) = [  1  R� ] ∈ H 2 (M , R).
2π 
Remark.  From  algebraic  topology,  we  can  obtain  an  associated  integer  class  c1 (L)  ∈  H 2 (M , Z)  corresponding 
to  this  form. 
Now,  let  E → M  be  a  complex  vector  bundle  with  connection �.

Deﬁnition  2.  The  total  Chern  form  is

Decomposing  this  element,  we  obtain  pro jections  cj (E , �)  ∈  Ω2j (M , C).  Here  I  +  i  R�  is  a  matrix  with 
entries  (const  +  2-forms)  in  a  local  trivialization,  and  det  is  the  usual  determinant  under  the  ∧  product.  As

before,  this  is  independent  of  change  of  basis.

We  can  do  the  same  for  any  ad-invariant  polynomial  in  R� ,  giving  Chern-Weil  theory  (for  complex  vector 
bundles,  simply  get  functions  of  c1 , . . . , cr ). 
Theorem  1.  cj (E , �)  is  closed,  and  cj (E ) = [cj (E , �)] ∈ H 2j (M , R)  is  independent  of  �. 
Proof.  Closedness  follows  from  the  Bianchi  identity  for  d� (R� ),  and  independence  follows  from  showing  that 
cj (E , �� ) − cj (E , �)  is  a  sum  of  exact  terms.

Remark.  Another  approach  involves  the  Euler  class  of  an  oriented  rank  k  real  vector  bundle  E
M  over 
a  compact,  oriented  manifold  M .  Let  s  be  a  section  of  E ,  chosen  so  s  is  transverse  to  the  zero  section  and 
Z  =  s−1 (0)  is  a  smooth,  oriented  submanifold  of  codimension  k .  Then,  at  a  point  of  Z ,  �s  : N Z  → E |Z  is  an 
isomorphism.  We deﬁne e(E ) = [Z ] ∈ Hn−k (M , Z) ∼= H k (M , Z) by Poincar´e duality.  If E  was a  rank r C-vector 
bundle,  then  cr (E ) = e(E ). 
Remark.  For T M  → M , e(T M ) ∈ H n (M , Z) = Z ⇔ χ(M ) = e(T M ) · [M ].  Moreover,  for E , � a ﬂat connection, 
cj (E ) = 0 ∈ H 2j (M , R).
