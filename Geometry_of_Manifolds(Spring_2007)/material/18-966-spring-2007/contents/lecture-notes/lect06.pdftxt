1.  Applications 
(1)  The  work  done  last  time  gives  us  a  new  way  to  look  at  TidSymp(M , ω)  (using  C 1 -topology,  wherein

Y  converges  to  f  iﬀ  fi 
Now,  f  ∈  Symp(M , ω)  gives  a  graph  graph(f ) =  {(x, f (x))} ⊂  (M  × M , pr∗ 
1ω  −  pr2
∗ω)  which  is  a 
Lagrangian  submanifold.  If  f  is C 1 -close  to  the  identity map,  then  graph(f )  is C 1 -close  to  the  diagonal 
Δ =  {(x, x)} ⊂  (M  × M , pr∗ 
1ω − pr2
∗ω)  (i.e.  the  graph  of  the  identity  map).  By  Weinstein,  a  tubular 
neighborhood of Δ is diﬀeomorphic to U0  ⊂ (T ∗M , ωT ∗M ), and the graph of f  gives a section (C 1 -close to 
the  zero  section),  i.e.  the graph of a C 1 -small µ ∈ Ω1 (M ).  The  fact  that  its graph  is Lagrangian  implies 
that  µ  is  closed,  i.e.  dµ = 0.  Thus,  we  have  an  identiﬁcation  Tid (Symp(M , ω)) ∼
= {µ ∈ Ω1 |
dµ = 0}  with
C 1  topologies.

Theorem  1.  For  (M , ω)  compact,  if  H 1 (M , R) = 0,  then  every  symplectomorphism  of  M  which  is  C 1 
close  to  the  identity  has  ≥ 2  ﬁxed  points. 
Theorem  2.  For  (M , ω)  symplectic, X  ⊂ (M , ω)  compact  and  Lagrangian,  if H 1 (X, R) = 0,  then  every 
Lagrangian  submanifold  of  M  which  is  C 1  close  to  X  intersects  X  in  ≥ 2  points. 
The  ﬁrst  theorem  follows  from  the  second,  using  the  diagonal  embedding  Δ  ⊂ M  × M .  To  see  the 
second  theorem,  note  that  H 1 (X ) = 0  implies  that,  given  any  graph  Y  = graph(µ)  C 1 -close  to  X  with 
dµ = 0,  we  have  µ = dh  for  some  h  : X  → R.  Since  such  an  h  must  have  at  least  2  critical  points,  ∃  at 
least  2  points  at  which  µ = 0,  i.e.  points  at  which  Y  intersects  X . 

2.  Arnold  Conjecture 
Arnold’s  conjecture:  Let  (M , ω)  be  compact,  f  ∈  Ham(M , ω)  the  time  1  ﬂow  of  XHt  for  Ht  : M  →  R  a 
1-periodic  Hamiltonian  (H  : M  × R → R  smooth  with  Ht+1  = Ht ).  Then  the  number  of  ﬁxed  points  of  f  is  at 
� � 
least  the minimal  number  of  critical  points  of  a  smooth  function  on M .  Moreover,  assume  the  ﬁxed  points  of  f 
are  nondegenerate,  i.e.  if  f (x) =  x  then  det  (dx f  − id)  =  0.  Then  #Fix(f )  is  at  least  the  minimal  number  of 
critical  points  of  a Morse  function  on M ,  which  in  turn  is  ≥ 
dim  H i (M ).

Remark.  The  last  inequality  follows  from  classical  Morse  theory.  Given  a  Morse  function  f  on  a  manifold 
tra jectories  between  critical  points.  Then H ∗ (C ∗ , d) � H ∗ (M ),  so  #Fix(f ) = �→
dim  C i  ≥ � 
M  (equipped  with  a  Riemannian  metric  satisfying  the  Morse-Smale  condition),  we  have  the  Morse  complex 
C i+1  which  counts  gradient 
C i  generated  by  critical  points  of  index  i,  and  the  Morse  diﬀerential  d  :  C i 
dim  H i . 
The  case where Ht  = H  is  independent  of  t  is  easy:  if  p  is  a  critical  point  of H  then XH (p) = 0  so  the  ﬂow  f 
ﬁxes  p.  The  general  case  was  proved  by  Conley-Zehnder,  Floer,  Hofer-Salamon,  Ono,  Fukaya-Ono,  Li-Tian,  ... 
of  the  loop  space,  � = {γ  : S 1  M  contractible  +  homotopy  class  of  disc  with  ∂D = γ }:
using Floer  homology.  Floer homology  is  formally  the ∞-dimensonal Morse  theory  of  a  functional  on  a  covering

Since  dHt  =  iXt ω ,  this  vanishes  ∀v  if  and  only  if  ˙γ (t) =  Xt (γ (t)),  i.e.  γ  is  a  periodic  orbit  of  the  ﬂow.  Hence 
critical points of AH  correspond  to ﬁxed points of f .  Moreover,  formally gradient  tra jectories of AH  correspond
