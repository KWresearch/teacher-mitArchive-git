Let  E M  be  a  complex  vector  bundle,  �  a  connection  on  E .  Recall  that  we  obtain  the  Chern  classes  of

Let  s  be  a  section  transverse  to  the  zero  section.  Let  Z  = s−1 (0)  be  its  zero  set:  then

is  the  Euler  class  of  E . 

1.1.  Chern Classes  of  Line  bundles.  We now restrict to understanding the ﬁrst Chern class of a  line bundle. 
If M  is compact, this is precisely the Euler class.  Now, consider a closed, oriented surface Σ:  any section vanishes 
� 
at  ﬁnitely many  points,  giving  us  a well-deﬁned  degree  by  counting  these  points  (with  sign).  Moreover, we  have 
that  c1 (L)  ∈  H 2 (L, Z)  ∼ Z  is  precisely  the  class  s.t.  c1 (L)[Σ]  =  deg  L.  Cut  Σ  into  two  parts  U  ∪ D2 ,  where
= 
U  =  S 1  holds  all  the  non-trivial  loops.  Any  complex  bundle  over  S 1  is  trivial,  so L  is  trivial  over  both U  and

∂D2  ∼
D2 .  To  obtain  L  from  L|U  and  LD2 ,  we  need  to  identify  L|∂U  = C × S 1  → L|
= C × S 1 .  This  corresponds
to  a  map  S 1  C∗  modulo  homotopy,  i.e.  an  element  of  π1 (S 1 ) ∼
→ 
= Z.
This  is  again  deg  L.
Remark.  Alternatively,  since  L  is  trivial  over  D2  and  U ,  we  have  a  non-vanishing  section  s  of  L|U .  The  Chern 
class  of  L  measures  why  this  section  cannot  be  extended  to  all  of  Σ.  Speciﬁcally,  the  Chern  class  corresponds

1.2.  Properties  of  Chern  Classes.  Let  c(E ) = 
(1)  c(E ⊕ F ) = c(E ) ∪ c(F ).

where  f ∗E  =  {(x, v)  ∈ X × E |f (x) =  π(v)},  we  have  c(f ∗ (E )) =  f ∗ (c(E )).  By  the  splitting  principle, 
for  any E → M ,  ∃f  : X  → M  s.t.  in  the  above  square,  f ∗  is  injective  on  cohomology,  and  f ∗E  splits  as 
a  sum  of  line  bundles. 
One  can  deﬁne  the  Chern  classes  via  these  properties  along  with  the  deﬁnition  of  the  ﬁrst  Chern  class  of  a  line 
bundle.  Our  deﬁnition  of  Chern  classes  (i.e.  via  the  curvature  R� )  also  satisﬁes  these  properties. 
(1)  Given bundles E , F  with connections �E , �F , the connection on the direct sum is precisely �E⊕F (s, t) = 
(�E (s), �F (t)),  implying  that  the  curvature  is  RE⊕F  = RE  ⊕ RF  as  desired.

f  is  a  local  section  of  f ∗E  near  x.  By  the

deﬁnition  of  the  pullback  connection,  �f ∗E (f ∗ (s)) =  f ∗ (� s).  Via  the  deﬁnition  of  curvature,  we  see 
E
that  f ∗ (R� ) = Rf ∗�  as  well,  implying  the  desired  pullback  property. 
Remark.  c1 (L)  ∈  H 2 (M , Z)  completely  classiﬁes  C-line  bundles.  Moreover,  it  deﬁnes  a  group  isomorphism 
between the set of  line bundles over M  under ⊗ with H 2 (M , Z).  To see this,  recall that a  line bundle  is precisely

Now,  for  (M , ω)  a  symplectic manifold,  J  a  compatible  almost-complex  structure,  (T M , J )  is  a  complex  vector 
bundle,  with  cj (T M )  ∈  H 2j (M , Z).  Since  the  RHS  is  discrete,  we  get  an  invariant  of  the  almost-complex 
structure  up  to  deformation,  and  since  the  space  of  compatible  J ’s  is  connected,  the  complex  isomorphism 
class  of  (T M , J )  is  uniquely  determined.  Explicitly,  if  Jt  is  a  family  of  complex  structures  on  E ,  the  map 
φ  : v  �→  1 (v − JtJt0 v)  is  a  complex  isomorphism  from  (E , Jt0 )  to  (E , Jt )  since

Thus,  cj (T M , J )  is  independent  of  the  choice  of  almost-complex  structure  (it  is  even  an  invariant  of  the  de­

Remark.  For  1  ≤  j  ≤  n − 1,  cj  does  depend  on  the  choice  of  symplectic  structure,  however:  there  exists  a 
4-manifold M  with  symplectic  forms  ω1 , ω2  s.t.  c1 (T M , ω1 ) =�
c1 (T M , ω2 ).
