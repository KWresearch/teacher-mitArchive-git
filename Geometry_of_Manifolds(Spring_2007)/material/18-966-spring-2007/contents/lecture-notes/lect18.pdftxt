Let  (M , ω , J )  be  a  compact  K¨ahler  manifold,  [ω ]  ∈  H 1,1 (M ) ∩ H 2 (M , Z).  Then  we  can  ﬁnd  a  line  bundle 
→
M  with  ﬁrst Chern  class  c1 (L) = [ω ].  Choose  a Hermitian metric  on L  along with  a Hermitian  connection 
L 
�
with  R�  =  −2π iω .  More  explicitly,  starting  with  any  hermitian  connection  �,  R�  is  a  closed  imaginary 
2-form:  in  a  trivialization, � = d + A,  so  R�  = dA + [A, A] = dA.  Thus, 
[R� ] = −2π ic1 (L) = −2π i[ω ] =⇒ ∃a ∈ Ω1 (M )  s.t.  R�  = −2π iω + ida 
(1)	
Letting ��  = � − ia,  we  ﬁnd  that  R�  = R − ida = −2π iω . 
Next,  recall  that  �0,1  deﬁnes  a  holomorphic  structure  on  L  iﬀ  (R� )0,2  =  0.  Since  ω  is  a  (1, 1)-form  and 
R�  = −2π iω , we  get  a  holomorphic  line  bundle  structure  for L.  We will  furthermore  see  that L⊗k  has  ”enough 
holomorphic  sections”,  i.e.  the  number  of  such  sections  → ∞.  Given  this,  consider  a  basis  of  holomorphic 
sections s0 , . . . , sN  ∈ H 0 (L) (or H 0 (L⊗k )).  Assume that, ∀p ∈ M , ∃s ∈ H 0 (L) s.t.  s(p) = 0.  Then we can deﬁne 
a map

More  intrinsically,  we  obtain  a  map 
M  → P(H 0 (L)∗ ), p  �→ Hp  = {s ∈ H 0 (L)|s(p) = 0} ⊂ H 0 (L) 
Here,  Hp  is  the  kernel  of  the  linear  form  given  by  evaluation  at  p,  well-deﬁned  up  to  scaling. 
→ 
P(H 0 (L)∗ )  is  a  wel l-deﬁned  embedding,  and  ample  if  L⊗k  is  very 

Deﬁnition  1.  L  is  very  ample  if  f  : M 
ample  for  some  k . 

We  can  reformulate  this  using  the  Kodaira  embedding  theorem: 
⇔

Theorem 1  (Kodaira).  A holomorphic  line bund le  is ample 
is  a  K¨ahler  form. 

it has a holomorphic connection whose curvature

The traditional proof of the Kodaira embedding theorem requires the Kodaira vanishing theorem.  Instead, we

π ] = c1 (L).  We  will  explicitly 
will  prove  this  using Donaldson’s  argument.  For  simplicity,  replace  ω  by  2

construct  holomorphic  sections  of  L⊗k  for  all  k >> 0. 
•  First,  ﬁx  p ∈ M ,  and  choose  local Darboux  coordinates  s.t.  ω =  i 
dzj  ∧ dzj  and  J  = J0 + O(|z |)  (we

can’t  assume  that  J  is  the  natural  complex  structure,  because  that  would  imply  the  K¨ahler metric  was 
ﬂat).

•	 Next,  choose  a  unitary  trivialization  of  L⊗k ,  so  that  �  corresponds  to

zj dzj  − zj dzj
d + iA0  = d + 
4 
To see that we can choose A in this way, note that, in any trivialization, � = d+ iA, so −ikω = R = idA. 
k � 
We  have 
dzj  ∧ dzj  = −ikω0  = idA 
idA0  = 
4 
Thus, A−A0  is closed and locally exact.  Moreover, changing the trivialization by f  = eiφ  ∈ C∞ (U, U (1)) 
changes  the  connection  1-form  to A�  = A + dφ.  Thus  a  suitable  change  of  trivialization  ensures  that  the 
connection  form  becomes  iA0 .

Remark.  Baby model:  assume J  = J0  in our coordinates (so that the K¨ahler metric is ﬂat), and consider 
s(z ) = exp(− 4  |z | 2 ):  this  function  arises  from  considering  the  curvature

Proposition  1.  If  (M , ω)  is  a  compact  symplectic  manifold  with  a  compatible  almost  complex  structure,  then 
∃  a  family  of  sections  (σk,p )k>>0,p∈M  which  are  uniformly  bounded,  approximately  holomorphic,  uniformly  con­
centrated,  and  |σk,p | ≥ c > 0  over  B (p, √1
).

In  the  K¨ahler  case,  we  also  have  the  following  approximation  theorem. 
Proposition  2.  Given  a  family  of  sections  {σk,p}  as  above,  ∃{σ˜k,p}  holomorphic  s.t. 
sup(kr/2  |�r σk,p  − �r σ˜k,p |) ≤ C e−λk/3 
(13)	
That  is,  any  estimate  you  make  via  σ  can  also  be  applied  to  ˜σ ,  so  you  can  assume  that  your  approximately 
holomorphic sections are holomorphic and obtain the desired embedding.  To use these sections to prove Kodaira 
embedding,  note  that  ∀p ∈ M , ∃s ∈ H 0 (L⊗k )  s.t.  s(p) =  0  since 
|σ˜k,p (p)| ≈  1  (that  is,  L⊗k  is  base  point  free). 
Moreover,  given  p =  q  ∈ M , ∃s, s�  ∈ H 0 (L⊗k )  s.t. 
|s(p)| >  |
s(q)|  and  s� (p) < s� (q) :  e.g.,  if  p, q  are  distant  by

more  than k−  we can  take s = ˜σk,p  and s�  = ˜σk,q  (that  is,  our  sections  separate points).  Finally,  at every point

by  choosing  a  local  holomorphic  coordinate  so  that  v = Re ∂ z
and  perturbing  z1σk,p  to  a  holomorphic  section;

setting  σ2  = ˜σk,p  gives  the  desired  nonzero  derivative.
