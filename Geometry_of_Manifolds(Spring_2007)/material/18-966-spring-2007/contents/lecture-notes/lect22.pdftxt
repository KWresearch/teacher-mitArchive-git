Remark.  In  dimension  4,  it  is  enough  to  have  Σ1  ⊂  M1
4  symplectic  submanifolds  with  the  self-
intersection  0  and  identical  genus  and  symplectic  area. 
We  can  generalize  this  construction  to  the  case  when  the  normal  bundles  are  no  longer  trivial,  but  dual  to 
each other, i.e.  c1 (N Q1 )+ c1 (N Q2 ) = 0:  this implies that we can do the gluing ﬁberwise since (N Q2 ) ∼= (N Q1 )∗ . 
Letting  L  =  N Q1 ,  we  consider  a  manifold  X  which  is  the  total  space  of  L ⊕ L∗  →  Q,  on  which  we  can  put  a 
symplectic  structure  compatible  with  the  symplectic  structures  on  L, L∗ .  By  local Moser,  ∃  a  local  description

M1 , M2  intersect  along  the  zero  section,  and 
M1  ∪Q M2  = {(q , s1 , s2 )|s1 s2  = 0}

Let  M	 =  {(q , s1 , s2 )|s1 s2  =  δχ(|s1 | , |s2 |)}  for  δ  =�
0  small  (can  consider  it  to  be  a  complex  number  ﬁxing 
L ⊗ L∗  ∼
= C  or  a  nonvanishing  section  of  L ⊗ L∗ )  and  χ  a  cutoﬀ  function  which  makes  M  look  like  M1  or  M2
away  from Q.  We  claim without  proof  that we  can  choose  δ  small  enough  that we  get  a  symplectic  structure  on 
M .

Remark.  In  dimension  4,  the  above  assumption  implies  that  [Σ1 ]  [Σ1 ] + [Σ2 ]  [Σ2 ]  =  0.  We  can  do  the  same 
construction assuming only  that  [Σ1 ]  [Σ1 ] + [Σ2 ]  [Σ2 ] ≥ 0.  Consider, L1  = N Σ1 , L2  = N Σ2 , X  = L1 ⊕ L2  → Σ,

and  set 
M  = {(q , s1 , s2 )|s1 s2  = δσ(q)χ(|s1 | , |s2 |)}

where  σ  is  a  section  of  L1  ⊗ L2 .  To  ensure  that  M  is  smooth,  we  need  σ  to  vanish  transversally,  i.e. 
its 
zeroes  ∼  σ(z ) =  z  or  σ(z ) =  z .  To  ensure  that  M  is  symplectic,  we  require  all  the  zeros  of  σ  to  have  complex 
orientation,  which  requires  ∼ σ(z ) = z  and  deg  (L1  ⊗ L2 ) ≥ 0. 
An  application  of  the  symplectic  sum  construction  is  the  following  result:

Theorem  1  (Gompf  1994).  Every  ﬁnitely  presented  group  G  is  π1  of  a  compact  symplectic  4  manifold. 
Write  G  =  �g1 , . . . , gk |r1 , . . . , rk �  where  gi  are  generators  and  ri  are  relations.  Let  F  be  a  compact  genus  k 
� 
surface  with  standard  generators  (α1 , β1 , . . . , αk , βk )  of  π1  s.t. 
k
π1 (F ) = �α1 , β1 , . . . , αk , βk | 
[αi , βi ] = 1� 
That  is,  F  = F 0  ∪ D2 ,  where  F 0  = �2g  S 1  is  the  1-skeleton  and  D2  is  attached  along �

αiβiα−1β−1 .

Now,  for  i = 1, . . . , �,  choose  γi  an  immersed  closed  curve  in  F  representing  σi (α1  · · · αk ).  Let  γ�+j  = βj  for 
i
j  = 1, . . . , k .  Then 
G = π1 (F )/�γ1  · · · γk+� � 
(8) 
Assume ∃ρ ∈ Ω1 (F ) a closed 1-form s.t.  ρ|
is a positive form at every point of every γi  (there exists a procedure 
γi 
to  do  this,  at  the  expense  of  increasing  the  genus  and  the  number  of  γi ’s).  Set X  = F  × T 2 , ω = ω1 + ω2 .  From 
before  we  have  γi  ⊂  F , ρ  ∈  Ω1 (F )  closed  s.t.  ρ|γi  >  0,  and  we  can  similarly  ﬁnd  αi  ⊂  T 2  disjoint  nontrivial 
simple  closed  curves  and  θ  ∈  Ω1 (T 2 )  closed  with  θ | >  0  (for  instance,  θ  =  dx  for  αi  =  S 1  × {pi }).  Then
αi 
Ti  = γi  × αi  are  Lagrangian  w.r.t  ω ,  symplectic  w.r.t.  ω �  = ω + ρ ∧ θ .  Now  do  a  symplectic  sum  construction, 
attaching  (CP2 , E  = {(x0  : x1  : x2 )|x3  + x3  + x3  = 0}).

Remark  (Adjunction  Formula).  For  a  connected,  embedded  compact  symplectic  Σ2  ⊂  (M 4 , ω),  T M |Σ  = T Σ ⊕
N Σ  as  symplectic  vector  bundles,  so 
c1 (T M |Σ ) = c1 (T Σ) + c1 (N Σ) ∈ H 2 (Σ) = Z 
c1 (T M )  [Σ] = 2 − 2g(Σ) + [Σ]  [Σ]

In  our  case,  this  implies  that  the  genus  is  1,  i.e.  we  have  a  torus  on  both  sides  that  can  be  glued.  The  tori 
·	
· 
[Ti ] = 0:  since  [E ]
Ti  are  disjoint,  and  [Ti ]
[E ] = 9,  we  can  do  the  symplectic  sum.  Doing  the  sums  along  the 
Ti  as  well  as  {z} × T 2 , z  ∈ F  � (  γi ),  we  kill  γi  and  the  generators  of  the  T 2 .  Indeed,  using  Van  Kampen,  we 
→
can  show  that  #E CP2  just  kills  Im(π1 (Σ) 
π1 (M )),  giving  us  the  desired manifold. 
Now  we  will  study  further  the  topology  of  4-manifolds. 
Problem.  Let M  be  the  connected  sum  of  9  copies  of CP2  and  44  copies  of CP2 .  Then M  is  homeomorphic  but 
not  diﬀeomorphic  to  {x5
3  = 0} ⊂ CP3 .
