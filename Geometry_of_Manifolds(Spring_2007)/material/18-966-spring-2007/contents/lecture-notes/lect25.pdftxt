1.  Spin  Structures 
Let  (X 4 , g)  be  an  oriented Riemannian manifold,  S  = S+ ⊕ S−  → X  a  spinc  structure with Cliﬀord multipli­
Example.  If X  is  almost-complex, S+  = ( �0,0 ⊗E ) ⊕ ( �0,2 ⊗E ), S−  = ( �0,1 ⊗E ),  γ (u) = 
cation  γ  : T ∗X ⊗ S → S .

(where  the  latter  group  is  the  space  of  traceless,  anti-hermitian  endomorphisms).  We  also  have  the  Dirac

decomposition  of  the  Dirac  operator  is  DA  = DA0  + γ (a).

2.  Seiberg-Witten  Equations 
Deﬁnition  1.  The  Seiberg-Witten  equations  are  the  equations 
DAψ = 0 ∈ Γ(S− )

where  A  is  a  Hermitian  connection  on  L = �2 S±  (corresponding  to  a  spinc  connection  �A ),  ψ  ∈  Γ(S+)  is  a

and  µ  is  an  imaginary  self-dual  form  ﬁxed  in  advance. 
Now,  there  exists  an  ∞-dimensional  group  of  symmetries  preserving  solutions,  called  the  gauge  group  G  = 
C∞ (X, S 1 )  where  f  ∈ C∞ (X, S 1 )  acts  by 
(A, ψ)  �→ (A − 2df  f −1 , f ψ)

Proposition 1.  This preserves  the solution space,  and  the action of G  is  free unless ψ ≡ 0 ( reducible solutions), 
where  Stab((A, 0)) ∼
is  the  space  of  constant  maps.

Idea:  We  want  to  understand,  given  a  solution  (A0 , ψ0 )  to  the  SW  equations,  the  nearby  solutions  to  the 
same  equations.  We  linearize  the  SW  equations,  and  let  (a, φ) ∈ Ω1 (X, iR) × C∞ (S+ )  be  a  small  change  in  the 
solution,  obtaining 
P1  : (a, φ)  �→ DA0 φ + γ (a)ψ0 
(5) 
as  the  linearization  of  the  ﬁrst  equation  and 
P2  : (a, φ)  �→ γ ((da)+ ) − (φ ⊗ ψ0 
∗  + ψ0  ⊗ φ∗ )0 
(6) 
as  the  linearization  of  the  second  equation.  We  restrict  P  =  P1  ⊕ P2  to  a  slice  transverse  to  the  G -action 
A  �→  A − 2df  · f −1 , ψ  �→  f ψ ,  i.e.  to  S  =  {(a, φ)|d∗a  =  0  and  Im(�φ, ψ0 �L2 ) = 0}  (which  is  transverse  to  the 
G -orbit at  (A0 , ψ0 )).  Then P |Ker  d∗×L2
1 (S+ )  is a diﬀerential operator of order 1,  and  is Fredholm  (f.d.  kernel and 
cokernel)  since 
(P  ⊕ d∗ ) : L2 (X, i∧1 ) × L2 (S+ ) → L2 (S− ) × L2 (X, i∧2  ) × L2 (X, iR)

(=  DA0  ⊕ (d+  ⊕ d∗ )  +  order  0)  is  elliptic.  Elliptic  regularity  implies  that  both  Ker  , Coker  lie  in  C∞ .  For 
generic  (g , µ),  P  is  surjective  (speciﬁcally,  consider  {(A, ψ , µ)| · · · }/G  and  apply  Sard’s  theorem  to  pro ject  to 
µ  and  ﬁnd  a  good  choice).  We  expect  that  Ker  P  is  the  tangent  space  to  M:  this  is  only  ok  if  Coker  P  =  0, 
so  we  can  use  the  implicit  function  theorem  to  show  that  M  is  smooth  with  T M  =  Ker  P |S .  The  statement 
about the dimension follows from the Atiyah-Singer  index  theorem, which gives a formula for d(S ) = ind(P |S ) = 
dim  Ker  − dim  Coker  .  Compactness  of M  follows  from  the  a  priori  bounds  on  the  solutions:  the  key  point  is 
that  we  get  a  bound  on  sup |ψ |,  so  elliptic  regularity  and  ”bootstrapping”  give  us  bounds  in  all  norms. 
Consider  a  solution  (A, ψ)  of  the  SW  equations  (for  simplicity  assume  µ  =  0).  We  have  the  following 
Weitzenbock  formula  for  the  Dirac  operator:

where �∗  is  the L2 -adjoint  of �A ,  s  is  the  scalar  curvature  of  the metric  g  (this  can  be  shown  by  calculation  in

Theorem  2.  If  g  has  scalar  curvature  > 0,  then  the  SW-invariants  ≡ 0. 
Proof.  A small generic perturbation ensures that there are no reducible solutions.  The above estimate on sup |ψ |
� 
ensures  that  there  are  no  irreducible  solutions  either.
