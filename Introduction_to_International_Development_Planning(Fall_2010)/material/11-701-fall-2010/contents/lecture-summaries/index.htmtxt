WEEKÂ TOPICS           LECTUREÂ SUMMARIES
        History:         What is the relationship between colonialism and development, in terms of
1       Colonialism and  institutional legacies, forms of representations and technologies of control?
        Imperialism      What is the correlation between colonial experience and economic development?
                         Is progress a western notion, which emerged during the Enlightenment or, can we
        History: Ideas   trace the concept to earlier times, and to non-western political/social
        and Ideologies   formations? Is it universal? What are the differences between the concepts of
2       of Progress and  progress, modernization, development and planning? How did these concepts
        Modernization    originate? How are they connected? Do different development planning traditions
                         draw on different aspects of the notion of Modernity? What is the relationship
                         between 'tradition' and 'modernity' in international development?
                         What do we make of anti-development arguments? Are they utopian or nihilist or
        Concepts: Pro    neither? Can one be anti-development and still plan? What are the
3       versus Anti-     justifications for planning? Or is the division between pro and anti too
        Development      Manichean? Why certain types of anti-planning arguments emerged at certain
                         times? What was the historical context in which these criticisms emerged? What
                         explains the rise, fall and now the latest rise of anti-development arguments?
                         Development Planners are often faced with having to compromise in reconciling
                         demands from very different groups, and are exposed to (sometimes conflicting)
        Concepts: The    sets of responsibility (e.g. personal, professional, authority). Within this
4       question of      context, what is an ethical compromise? What is the ethics of planners
        Ethics           remaining "neutral"? What responsibility should influence their practice? What
                         is the source of ethical values? What ethical framework governs a context of
                         radical cultural pluralism, as in a Western planner working in non-Western
                         countries?
        Econ.            What do the economists say about economic development? Is planning necessary in
        development      their models? Are dependency theorists hostile to planning? Are there echoes of
5       theories:        dependency theorists in current day criticisms of global governance
        Neoclassical and institutions such as the WTO and the arguments for 'policy space'?
        Dependency
        Econ.            What is the neoliberal vision of the State? How does that differ from the role
        Development      of the State in East Asia? What is the role of civil society or labor or
6       Theories: State  democracy in the East Asian experience? What role, if any, does State
        Intervention and intervention have in economic development theory? Consider this in the context
        the East Asian   of new institutionalist theories in the next class.
        miracle
        Econ.            What is the basis for the belief that law will lead to development? Is law a
        Development      tool for development or is a development goal in itself? What is the meaning of
7       Theories: New    institutions â can one unbundle them and if so, what is the role of law as an
        Institutionalism institution as opposed to other institutions, in development?
        and Law
        Alternative Dev. What is the added value of thinking about development as freedom? Will it help
8       Theories: Human  or hinder development planning? What is the relationship between the definition
        Rights and       of development as freedom, and the move towards rights-based development
        Development      planning? Who gets to exercise the right to development?
        Development      Does development have any core of agreed upon meaning today or has it become
        theories today   all-inclusive and therefore meaningless? How can one think of success in
9       in the context   development terms today and which countries or communities would be role
        of global crisis models? Is today's global crisis one created by too much markets or government
                         or too little and if so what scale?
                         What is the role of the State in development planning? Is the 'Third World
                         State' expected to behave differently from the 'First World' State in its
10      Actors: State    relation to industry, private sector, financial markets and social programs?

                         from other actors in planning?
                         How are market institutions different from the state? What do you need to know
        Actors: Markets  about market institutions if you want to work with them? How can you work
11      and              jointly within different types of organizations and what are the challenges you
        Marketization    might face by doing that? How does marketization â the process of creating
                         markets â happen and what mistakes should it avoid?
        Actors: Civil    There is no doubt about the mission of NGOs for promoting development. How good
        Society: NGOs    are NGOs as development agents? In what circumstances are they more effective

        Movements        civil society actors in development such as social movements? What is the

        Actors: Informal in informal settlements which are also often illegal in many ways. How does

        Illegality       formal economy? Who plans for outcomes in informal economies? Is formalization
                         â of tenure arrangements etc. â the answer?
                         What is the scale at which global institutions operate these days? What kinds
