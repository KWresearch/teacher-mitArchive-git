***** First Homework Assignment *****
Hegel, G. W. F. Reason in History.
How does Hegel define the following terms
   1. Freedom
   2. Spirit
   3. Idea
   4. State
Devote one or two paragraphs to each definition.
***** Second Homework Assignment *****
The Bastille and the French Republic.
Write at least one or two substantial paragraphs in response to each of the
following questions.
   1. Consider the documents and images from the storming of the Bastille on
      the Liberty,_Equality,_Fraternity web site. Do these documents support or
      contradict the interpretation of 14 July 1789 offered by Thomas Carlyle?
      Do they support or contradict the interpretation offered by Jules
      Michelet?
   2. What issues interest Georges RudÃ© in his analysis of the events of 14
      July 1789? Is the evidence he considers different from that considered by
      Carlyle and Michelet in the nineteenth century?
   3. According to Christian Amalvi, how have past celebrations of the taking
      of the Bastille served the needs of various governing regimes in France?
      How successful have these states been in bending the history of this
      event to their needs?
***** Third Homework Assignment *****
Turner. Frontier Thesis.
Write at least one or two substantial paragraphs in response to each of the
following questions.
   1. Summarize the essential features of Turner's "Frontier Thesis" in a
      paragraph or two.
   2. In "The Frontier as an Explanation.", Richard Hofstadter presents a
      number of criticisms of Turner. Which criticism do you find most
      compelling, and why?
   3. In her essay "Turnerians All...", Patricia Limerick Nelson suggests the
      following about the importance of Turner's work at the end of the
      twentieth century: "The familiar dispute â Was Turner right about the
      frontier? â has become trivial and arcane. The much less familiar
      question â Was Turner right about the present-day value of historical
      understanding? â remains the question of consequence." (p. 715) Why is
      this question consequential for Limerick in 1995? Would it have been
      consequential for Hofstadter in 1968?
***** Fourth Homework Assignment *****
Braudel. Mediterranean.
Write at least one or two substantial paragraphs in response to each of the
following questions.
   1. State the thesis of Braudel's book.
   2. Is Braudel a follower of Hegel's philosophy of history, either implicitly
      or explicitly, or does he understand and analyze the past differently
      than the German philosopher?
   3. Do Turner and Braudel understand the interaction between the natural
      environement and human society in the same way? Discuss the similarities
      and differences in their approaches.
***** Fifth Homework Assignment *****
Discipline and Punish.
Write at least one or two substantial paragraphs in response to each of the
following questions.
   1. ln Discipline and Punish, Michel Foucault offers a history of prisons in
      the west in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The book, however,
      is not simply about the administrative details of penal reform in this
      period; Foucault is also interested in the changing relation between the
      state and the individual. According to the author, how do changes in
      criminal punishment provide insight into the larger issue of government/
      citizen relations?
   2. What types of evidence does Foucault use in this study? Should he have
      sought out other sources? Cite a specific example from the text to
      support your claims.
   3. Would you say that Foucault is a Hegelian? Why or why not?
   4. Would Braudel say that this study is an example of event-oriented
      history, of the foam riding the crest of the waves? Would he situate the
      phenomena studied by Foucault at the level of conjunctural or structural
      history? Or is Foucault's methodology so different from that of Braudel
      that comparisons are inappropriate?
***** Sixth Homework Assignment *****
The Return of the Anecdote?
Write at least one or two substantial paragraphs in response to each of the
following questions.
   1. What are the benefits of Robert Darnton's historiographical method (a
      detailed study of a discrete, well-documented incident)? Do you find this
      approach more satisfying than Braudel's emphasis on long-term structures?
      (Remember, Braudel would dismiss the "great cat massacre" as the "foam on
      the waves" of the historical ocean.)
   2. What, in your view, is Mah's most damning critique of Darnton's essay? Do
      you find that Mah's work invalidates Darnton's essay?
   3. List three questions that the "coachman's bare rump" documents prompt you
      to ask. We will discuss your questions, the documents, and interpretive
      strategies in class.
