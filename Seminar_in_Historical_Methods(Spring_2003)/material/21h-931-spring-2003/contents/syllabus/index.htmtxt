***** Course Description *****
This subject is designed to give 21H majors and minors an introduction to the
methods that historians use to interpret the past. We will focus on two areas:
archives and interpretation. In our work on archives, we will ask what
constitutes an archive. We will visit one or two local archives, speak with
archivists, and assemble our own archive related to life at MIT in 2003. Once
we have a better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of
historical archives, we will turn to the task of interpreting archival
findings. We will discuss a series of readings organized around the theme of
history and national identity in various parts of the world since the end of
the eighteenth century. Students will also be asked to write a 15-page research
paper, and present their work orally to the class.
***** Subject Requirements *****
Active class participation is central to our work together. Attendance is
mandatory, and students are expected to arrive in class on time and prepared to
discuss common readings. A student who misses two or more class sessions will
automatically fail the subject. Students will write a five-page paper, due in
its final version in week #9, and a fifteen-page research paper due in week
#14, the final day of classes. Students will make two oral presentations in
class, in week #4 and week #14. Before some class sessions, students will
submit electronic responses to questions regarding the week's readings; these
questions will be distributed in advance. There will be no exams and no final.
Each assignment will be weighted as follows in the calculation of the final
grade, although these calculations will also take into account improved
performance during the course of the semester:
