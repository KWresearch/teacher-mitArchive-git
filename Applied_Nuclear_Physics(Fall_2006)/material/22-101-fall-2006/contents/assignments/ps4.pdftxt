Problem Set No. 4 
Problem 1 
(a)  It is well known that the cross section σ is a measure of the probability of having 
a reaction, yet σ has the dimension of an area.  Give a physical definition of σ 
that shows clearly its connection to the probability of a reaction and at the same 
time explains why σ has the dimension that it does.  Give a simple interpretation 
of the ratio: {reaction probability}/σ .  Discuss whether your definition of σ 
allows σ to be calculated. 
(b)  Extend your consideration of σ as the scattering cross section to the angular 
differential scattering cross section  dσ / dΩ , and furthermore to the energy 
differential scattering cross section  dσ / dE , and the double differential scattering 
cross section  d 2σ / dΩdE .  Give some thoughts to the physical interpretations of 
the three differential cross sections, and the relations they have with each other 
and with σ . 
Problem 2 
Verify the following results in the Lecture Notes (Lecture 7) by direct derivation. 
(a)  Equation (7.3) 
(b)  Equation (7.8). 
(c)  Equations (7.17) and (7.19). 
Problem 3 
Calculate the neutron scattering cross section of C12 for thermal neutrons.  Assume a 
potential well with depth Vo = 36 Mev and range ro = 1.4xA1/3 F and consider only the s-
wave contribution.  Compare your result with the experimental value (use the Table of 
Nuclides (kaeri), http://atom.kaeri.re.kr/) and discuss any significance that you can observe.  
How does your result compare with the cross section of H1?  Explain the difference 
between neutron scattering by C12 and by H1 in terms of the physics of neutron-nucleus 
interactions.
