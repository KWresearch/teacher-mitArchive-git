22.101 Applied Nuclear Physics 
(Fall 2006) 

Problem Set No. 6 

Due:  Nov. 1, 2006 

Problem 1 
Using the semiempirical mass formula and the Table of Nuclides calculate a few 
(enough) points to construct an overall B/A curve.  Sketch this curve along with the 
contributions from the various terms in the mass formula.  Compare your results with 
those given in the Lecture Notes, Figs. 10.1 and 11.1.  Discuss what you have learned 
from this exercise. 
Problem 2 
Use the semi-empirical mass formula to determine which isobar(s) with A = 102 should 
be stable.  Indicate the various modes of decay and the predicted stable isotope.  Compare 
your results with experimental data.  Again discuss what does one learn from this 
exercise. 
Problem 3 
Consider the series disintegration  A → B → C → D  (stable), with decay constants 
λA ,λB ,λC  respectively.  Set up the governing equations and solve for the number of 
atoms of B, C, and D at time t given initial values of Ao, Bo, Co, and Do at t = 0.  Sketch 
you results for the case where the parent is very long-lived, then repeat for the case where 
the grand daughter is long lived.  Discuss and contrast the behavior in these two 
situations. 
Problem 4 
Write a short essay (two pages or less) describing the genealogy of α -particle emitting 
heavy nuclides (see Evan, pp. 517-523).  Explain briefly what is meant by the Thorium, 
Neptunium, Uranium, and Actinium series.  What happens to the α - and β -particles 
emitted by a decay series?
