Problem Set No. 2	
Problem 1 
(a)  Starting with the time-dependent Schrödinger wave equation, derive an equation 
for the probability density  P (r , t ) = Ψ + (r , t )Ψ (r , t )  in the standard form of the 
continuity equation, and in this way obtain the expression for the particle current 
which is quoted in Lec2, Eq. (2.24).

(b)  Apply (2.24) to a plane wave,  exp[i k ⋅ r ] , where k is the wave vector, then give a 
physical interpretation of your result.  How does the current differ from the flux 
which is defined as the particle number density times the particle speed (as in a 
beam of particles of a given flux)? 

Problem 2 
Solve the 1D time-independent Schrödinger wave equation for the bound states of a 
particle in a square well, choosing the even-parity solutions for the interior wave 
function.  Discuss what determines the number of bound states that one can have.  
Compare your results with the determination of bound states using the odd-parity 
solutions.   

Sketch and discuss qualitatively the first two eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that one 
would obtain under the approximation that potential well becomes very deep. 

Problem 3 
(a)  Write down the time-independent Schrödinger wave equation of a system of 
two particles, mass m1 and m2, interacting through a central potential V(r), 
where r is the separation distance between the two particles,  r  =  r 1  − r 2  . 
Introduce the center-of-mass  R = [m1 r 1  /(m1  + m2 ) + m2 r 2  /(m1  + m 2 )]  and 
relative  r  = r 1  − r 2  coordinates and show that the wave equation for two 
particles naturally separates into two equations, one for the center-of-mass 
coordinate and another for the relative coordinate.  Discuss what is interesting 
about each equation.  What do your results say about the reduction of a 2­
body collision problem into an effective one-body problem of a particle 
moving in a potential field? 

(b) 	

Carry out the same reduction for the Newton’s equation.of motion for the 
system of two colliding particles.  [Note:  This part is for extra credit.]
