22.101 Applied Nuclear Physics  (Fall 2006) 

Due:  Sept. 13, 2006 

Problem Set No. 1 
Problem 1 
Before getting into the concepts of nuclear physics, every student should have some feeling for 
the numerical values of properties of nuclear radiations, such as energy and speed, wavelength, 
and frequency, etc.  This involves some back of the envelope calculations using appropriate 
universal constants. 
 A thermal neutron in a nuclear reactor is a neutron with kinetic energy equal to kBT, 
(i)	
where kB is the Boltzmann’s constant and T is the temperature of the reactor.  Explain 
briefly the physical basis of this statement.  Taking T to be the room temperature, 
20C, calculate the energy of the thermal neutron (in units of ev), and then find its 
speed v (in cm/sec), the de Broglie wavelength λ (in A) and circular frequency 
ω (radian/sec).  Compare these values with the energy, speed, and interatomic 
distance of atoms that make up the materials in the reactor.  What is the point of 
comparing the neutron wavelength with typical atomic separations in a solid? 
Consider a 2 Kev x-ray, calculate the frequency and wavelength of this photon.  
What would be the point of comparing the x-ray wavelength with that of the thermal 
neutron?  For an electron with wavelength equal to that of the thermal neutron, what 
energy would it have? 
The classical radius of the electron, defined as  e 2 / me c 2 , with  e  being the electron 
charge,  me   the electron rest mass, and c the speed of light, has the value of 2.818 x 
10-13 cm.  Use this fact to calculate the Coulomb repulsion energy between two 
protons at a distance of 1 F.  On the basis of this result what can you conclude about 
the energy that is holding together a nucleus of  several protons and neutrons?

Problem 2 
Use the Table of Nuclides (kaeri) website, http://atom.kaeri.re.kr/  to find the necessary data on 
the lightest chemical element, hydrogen (Z = 1), to answer the following questions. 
(1)  How many isotopes of hydrogen are there? 
(2)  Is each isotope stable?	  If not, describe fully the decay scheme (half life, what particle is 
given off at what energy). 
(3)  State the spin, electric and magnetic moments of each isotope. 
Comment briefly on what special interest hydrogen might hold in the three main application areas 
in the department, fission, fusion, and nuclear science and technology. 

Repeat the questions (1) and (2) for the element uranium (Z=92) considering only the long-lived 
isotopes U233, U235, and, U238 . 
Problem 3 
Use the Table of Nuclides (kaeri) to find the thermal neutron absorption cross section of two 
hydrogen isotopes, H1 and H2, and the thermal neutron fission cross section of two uranium 
isotopes, U235 and U238 .  Combine this information with the natural abundance of these four 
isotopes.  Write a paragraph discussing the connections between the nuclear properties dictated 
by nature and the historical developments of nuclear power reactors in the US and in Canada.
