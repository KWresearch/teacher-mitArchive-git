22.101 Applied Nuclear Physics 
(Fall 2006) 

Due:  Oct. 25, 2006 

Problem Set No. 5 
Problem 1 
Consider Figs. 9.1 through 9.4.  Explain in your own words the information given in each 
figure.  Is the information consistent from one figure to another?  What is the overall 
picture of nuclear stability when the figures are taken together? 
Problem 2 
Explain the addition of spin and orbital angular momentum operators to form the total 
angular momentum operator,   j = S + L , in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues 

of the these operators.  In what way is addition of angular momentum operators different 
from the geometric addition of two classical vectors? 
Problem 3 
Write a brief essay (no more than two pages) summarizing the essential arguments that 
lead to the explanation of the magic numbers in terms of the nuclear shell model. 
Problem 4 
On the basis of the single-particle shell model with spin-orbit coupling (Fig. 9.6), predict 
the ground-state spin and parity of the following nuclides: 

 

 

Be7,  F19,  Al27,  Fe57,  Mo95,  Eu153 ,  Au197,  Pb207, U233 
 
 
 
 

Compare your results with experimental data (e.g., Nuclide Chart); in the case of any 
discrepancy between your predictions and data, give an explanation.
