Problem 1 
Show that alpha particles and protons having the same initial speed (high speed but 
nonrelativistic) have approximately the same range in any stopping material.   Examine 
  
the figu to see which particle should have a slightly longer range.  Justify your answer. 

Problem 2 
The range-energy relationship for protons in air at 1 atm. and 15o C, given in Meyerhof as 
Fig. 3.9 is attached below.  From this deduce the energy loss (in Mev cm2/gm) curve for 
the same energy range.  Compare your result with Fig. 13.2 in the Lecture Notes as well 
as analyze your result using the Bethe formula.

Problem 3 
Estimate the contributions to the stopping power due to ionization and to radiation for the 
passage of electrons with energy E in aluminum.  Consider E = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 Mev.  

Express your results in a sketch (in units of Mev/mm and Mev cm2/gm) and compare 
with those given in the Lec14.  Discuss the significance of your results and the 
comparison. 

Problem 4 
Consider neutron elastic scattering where the target nucleus can be taken to be at rest. 
(a)  Derive the Q-equation and show that Eq.(15.7) is a solution. 
(b)  Show that in CMCS the magnitudes of the neutron and target nucleus velocities 
remain unchanged after the scattering. 
(c)  Derive Eq.(15.15) using Fig. 15.2(c).
