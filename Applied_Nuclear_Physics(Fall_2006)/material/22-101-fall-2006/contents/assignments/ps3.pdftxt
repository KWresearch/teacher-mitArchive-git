Problem 1 
Derive the  l =0 (s-wave) radial wave equation from the time-independent Schrödinger 
wave equation for a particle in a spherical well of width ro and depth Vo.  Solve this 
equation for the ground state wave function and the corresponding bound-state energy. 
Sketch and discuss briefly your results and then indicate what changes would occur if the 
well were to become very steep and very narrow.  Discuss the difference between this 
solution and the corresponding ground state solution in the one-dimensional problem. 

Problem 2 
In classical mechanics a particle incident upon a potential with range ro at an impact 
parameter b would be scattered if b < ro, but if b were greater than ro then there would be 
no interaction.  Use this simple picture to show that in the scattering of a neutron at low 
energy, by which we mean kro <<1, with  E = h
2k 2 / 2m , only the s-wave interaction is 
important.  Taking ro = 1.5 F, what is the range of neutron energy where this 
approximation is valid? 

Problem 3 
Consider the one-dimensional problem of a particle of mass m and energy E incident 
upon a potential barrier of height Vo and width L (Vo < E) going from left to right.  
Derive the expression for the transmission coefficient in which you have introduced the 
wavenumber κ=  2m(Vo  − E ) / h .  Sketch the variation of T with κL .  What physical 
interpretation can you give for the dimensionless quantity κL ?  For nuclear physics 
problems which is the more realistic limit between thin barrier and thick barrier (why)?
