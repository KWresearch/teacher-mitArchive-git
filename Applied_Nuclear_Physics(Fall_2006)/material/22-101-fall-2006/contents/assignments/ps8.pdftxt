Due:  December 6, 2006 

Problem 1 
Consider the problem of neutron elastic scattering in the notation as used in class.  
(a)  Find an expression for E4 involving E1 and angle γ (the angle between the recoil 
direction of M4 and the x-axis).  Is there a one-to-one relation between E4 and γ ? 
(b)  Eliminate γ in favor of θc  in your result in (a), then use the fact that the 
scattering is isotropic in CMCS to find the distribution P(E4), the probability per 
unit energy that the recoil nucleus will have energy E4. 
(c)  How would you obtain P(E4) directly from the result for  F (E '→ E )  derived in 
class?  How general is your relation between P and F? 

Problem 2 
Consider Compton scattering of a photon.  Derive the four expressions stated in 
the Lecture Notes for (i) the Compton shift, (ii) energy of the scattered photon, (iii) 
energy of the recoiling electron, and (iv) the relation between the angles of the scattered 
photon and the recoiling electron. 

Problem 3 
Calculate the energy distribution of Compton electrons for an incident photon of 
energy 1.20 Mev.  Give your results as the energy differential cross section,  dσ / dT , in 
units of 10-25 cm2/Mev, at electron energies 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9 and 0.99 Mev.  Make a 
sketch of  dσ / dT   and compare with the corresponding figure in the Lecture Notes. 

Problem 4 
A sodium iodide detector in the shape of a 7 cm cube is bombarded by a beam of 
2.8 Mev gamma radiation normal to one face of the cube. 

(a)  What fraction of the gamma radiation is detected? 

(b)  What fraction of the detected gamma appears in the photo peak, the Compton 

distribution, and the pair peaks, assuming no re-absorption of Compton gamma or 

annihilation quanta?

(c)  Make a rough estimate of the relative fraction of pair events that appear in the full-

energy (photo) peak, in the one-escape peak, and in the two-escape peak.  Compare your 

result with the figure given in the Lecture Notes. 

(Note:  The attenuation coefficients that you will need can be found in Evans, Chap. 25,  

Sec.1.  For 0.51 Mev photons, µ=  0.33 cm-1.  For 2.8 Mev photons, µ=  0.135 cm-1, 

µτ =  2.5 x 10-3 cm-1, µC =  0.113 cm-1, µκ =  0.020 cm-1.)
