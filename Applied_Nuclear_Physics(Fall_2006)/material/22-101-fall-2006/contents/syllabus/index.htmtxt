***** Description *****
22.101 is dedicated to foundational study of nuclear radiations - neutrons,
gamma rays and charged particles and their interactions with matter. Of primary
interest are the basic concepts of nuclear stability and reactive collision
phenomena involving elementary quantum and classical mechanics, along with
kinematics relations based on conservation laws. A signature focus is the
understanding of cross sections and their use in various application areas
relevant to the Department.
