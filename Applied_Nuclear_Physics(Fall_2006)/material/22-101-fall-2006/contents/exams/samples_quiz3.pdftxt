Sample questions for Quiz 3, 22.101 (Fall 2006) 

Following questions were taken from quizzes given in previous years by S. Yip.  They 
are meant to give you an idea of the kind of questions (what was expected from the class 
in previous times) that have been asked in the past.  Percentage credit is indicated for 
each question based on 100% for a 90-min Quiz (closed book).  Problem numbering 
means nothing here.    

You will have to decide for yourself what connections, if any, there may be between 
these questions and the Quiz 3 that will be conducted on Dec. 13, 2006. 

Problem 1 (20%) 

Define concisely what is Compton scattering.  Derive the relation between incident 
gamma energy  hω and scattered gamma energy  hω'  for Compton scattering which also 
involves the scattering angle θ .  What is the similarity (and difference) between this 
relation and the corresponding relation involving incident and scattered energies in 
neutron elastic scattering? 

Problem 2  (30%) 

Consider the measurement of monoenergetic gammas (energy  hω ) in a scintillation 
detector whose size is small compared to the mean free path of the secondary gammas 
produced by interactions of the incident (primary) gammas in the detector. 

(10%) (a)  Sketch the pulse-height spectrum of low-energy gammas, say  hω < 500 kev. 
Explain briefly the important characteristics of this spectrum in terms of the different 
interactions that can take place. 

(10%) (b)  Repeat (a) for higher-energy gammas,  hω > 2 Mev. 
(10%) (c)  What other peaks can appear in the pulse-height spectrum if the detector were 
not small?  Give a sketch and explain briefly. 

Problem 3 (30%) 

(15%) (a)  You are told the reaction  13C (d , p)14 C  has a resonance at a deuteron energy  Ed 
(LCS), and following this,  14C  undergoes β−  decay to  14N .  Draw the energy level 
diagram for this situation in which you show explicitly how the following energies can be 
calculated in terms of known masses and Ed: (1) kinetic energy available for reaction To, 
(2) Q value for the reaction, (3) deuteron separation energy, (4) proton separation energy, 
and (5)  Qβ . 

(15%) (b)  On the basis of (a), predict whether or not the reaction  11B(α, n)14 N  will have a 
resonance, and if so, at what energy of the α particle this will occur.  (Since you are not 

given numerical values, you should leave your answer in terms of defined quantities such 
as masses and various energies.) 

Problem 4 (20%) 

Sketch the energy variation of an observed resonance in (a) neutron elastic scattering 
(resonance scattering in the presence of potential scattering), and (b) neutron inelastic 
scattering.  Comment on the characteristic features in the cross sections, especially the 
low-energy behavior below the resonance.  What is the connection between the energy at 
which the observed cross sections show a peak and the energy of the nuclear level 
associated with the resonance?  (You may assume it is the same level in both cases.) 

Problem 5 (20%) 

Sketch the peaks that one would observe in the pulse-height spectra of a small detector in 
the presence of a 2-Mev gamma ray source, including any radiation from the background. 
For each peak identify the radiation interaction process that gives rise to it and indicate 
the energy at which this peak would appear. 

Problem 6 (25%) 

Consider the compound nucleus reaction of inelastic scattering of neutrons at energy T1 
AX . 
(LCS) by a nucleus  Z

(a)  Draw the energy level diagram showing the different energies that one can use to 
describe this reaction (including the Q value). 

(b)  Write down the corresponding Breit-Wigner cross section in terms of some of the 
energies shown in (a).  Define all the  parameters appearing in your expression. 

Problem 7  (10%) 

Consider the reaction  a + b → c + d , where Q is nonzero and particle b is stationary.  
What can you say about the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the center-of-mass 
before and after the reaction? 

Problem 8 (20%) 

The decay scheme of  80 Br  is shown below.  Classify the various decay modes and 
estimate all the decay constants that you can. 

Problem 9  (15%) 

At time t = 0 you are given an atom that can decay through either of two channels, a and 
b, with known decay constants λa  and λb .  Find the probability that it will decay by 
channel a during the time interval between  t1  and  t2  , with  t1  and  t2  arbitrary.  Interpret 
your result. 

Problem 10  (20% total) 

Consider a beam of collimated, monoenergetic neutrons (energy E) incident upon a thin 
target (density N atoms per cc) of area A and thickness  ∆ x  at a rate of I neutrons/sec. 
Assume the cross sectional area of the beam is greater than A.  An energy sensitive 
detector subtended at an angle θ with respect to the incident beam direction is set up to 
measure the number of neutrons per second scattered into a small solid angle  dΩ  about 
the direction  Ω  and into a small energy interval dE’ about E’.  Let this number be 
denoted by  Π . 

(a)  (15%) 	 Define the double (energy and angular) differential scattering cross section 
d 2σ / dΩdE' in terms of the physical situation described above such that you relate 
this cross section to the scattering rate  Π  and any other quantity in the problem.   
(You may find it helpful to draw a diagram of the specified arrangement.) 

(b)  (5%)  	 How is  d 2σ / dΩdE'  related to the angular and energy differential cross 
sections,  dσ / dΩ  and  dσ / dE' , respectively (no need to define the latter, assume 
they are known)? 

Problem 11  (25%) 

In neutron elastic scattering by hydrogen where the target nucleus is assumed to be at 
rest, the ratio of final to initial neutron energy is E’/E = (1/2)(1 +  cos θc ), where θc  is the 
scattering angle in CMCS.  Suppose you are told the angular distribution of the scattered 
neutrons is proportional to  cos θc  for  0 ≤ θc  ≤ π / 2  and is zero for all other values of θc  . 
Find the corresponding energy distribution F( E →  E' ) .  Sketch your result and discuss 
how it is different from the case of isotropic angular distribution.

Problem 13 (20%) 

In neutron radiation damage studies an incident neutron with energy E collides with an 
atom in the crystal lattice, called the primary knock-on atom (PKA), causing it to recoil 
and displace a number of other atoms in the solid. 

(a)  (8%) Calculate the average recoil energy of the PKA (mass A).   	State all  

assumptions involved in your calculation. 


(b)  (12%) 	 Let the number of atoms displaced by a PKA with energy T be denoted by 
ν (T) which behaves as follows 

ν (T)  =  0 	

   
for  0  < T < Ed 

=  T/2Ed	

 Ed < T < Lc 

where Ed is the energy to displace an atom, and Lc is the energy above which all 
the energy loss is by electronic excitation.  Find the average number of atoms 
displaced as a function of E in the range, 0 < E < Lc.  Call this quantity NE. 
(Note:  Neither ν nor NE are distributions.) 

Problem 14 (15%) 

When a beam of photons with wavelength 0.7 A is scattered by carbon at various 
scattering angles, the observed spectra behave in a way as sketched schematically.  What 
is the process responsible for the peak at 0.7 A?  What is the process responsible for the 
other peak in the spectrum?  Comment on the variation with scattering angle of the two 
peaks.
