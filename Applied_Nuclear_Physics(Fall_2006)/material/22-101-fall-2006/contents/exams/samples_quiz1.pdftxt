Sample questions for Quiz 1, 22.101 (Fall 2006) 

The following questions are taken from quizzes given in previous years by S. Yip. Also 
attached at the end is the Quiz 1 given last year.  These are all meant to give you an idea 
of the kind of questions (what was expected from the class in previous times) that have 
been asked in the past.  Percentage credit is indicated for each question, total for the 90-
min Quiz (closed book) is 100%.    

You will have to decide for yourself what connections, if any, there may be between 
these questions and the Quiz 1 that will be conducted on Oct. 16, 2006.

(dσ / dΩ )o  = (1 / k 2 ) sin 2 δo ( k ) , use your result from (a) to find the total scattering cross 

section σ o  .  Suppose we apply this calculation to n-p scattering and use for R the radius 
of the deuteron,  R = h  m nE B  , where mn is the neutron mass and EB is the ground state 
energy of the deuteron.  Find R in unit of F (1 F = 10-13 cm), and σ o  in barns.

barrier. 

Problem 7 (10%) 

Suppose you do not know the gamma ray energy that is given off when the proton 
absorbs a neutron, but you have the Chart of Nuclides.  How would you go about 
determining the energy of the gamma (state the steps but do not do the math)?  Can you 
also find out the cross section value for this reaction? 

Problem 8 (25%) 

In a one-dimensional system with a square well potential, depth Vo and range ro, is it 
possible to have at least one bound state no matter what the values of Vo and ro?  What 
happens in three dimensions with a spherical well potential, depth Vo and range ro?  In 
each case, explain your answer with a sketch of the wave function.  [Note:  you should 
answer this question without going through any derivation.]

The s-wave scattering cross section is σ o  = (4π / k 2 ) sin 2 δo (k ) , where δo (k )  is an 
energy-dependent phase shift.  In the case of low-energy scattering, i.e., kro << 1,  δo (k )

between the behavior of σ o  and the calculation of bound states in a deep spherical 
well potential?

barrier of height Vo with the same range (give a sketch)?

QUIZ No. 1 (closed book) 	

Problem 1 (35%) 

(a)  Calculate the thermal neutron scattering cross section of hydrogen using the phase 
shift method and the approximation that the scattering potential is an impenetrable 
sphere of radius R, where R is the nuclear radius of the deuteron (estimate by 
whatever reasonable means you like).  Solve the s-wave radial wave equation to 
determine the phase shift, the corresponding angular differential cross section and 
the total cross section σ  .  Evaluate the numerical value of σ  .
o	
o 

(b)  Compare you numerical value with the value obtained in the Lecture Notes by a 
similar calculation but not assuming the potential is an impenetrable sphere, and 
with the experimental value.  Explain the implication of any agreement or 
discrepancy in this comparison. 

(c)  Can you imagine a way to modify your calculation (still assuming the 
impenetrable sphere model for the interaction) to treat the neutron-proton 
scattering as spin dependent?  Comment on whether the concept of the scattering 
length still applicable.  

Problem 2 (25%) 

Consider Problem 1 but now take the interaction potential to be a spherical barrier of 
height Vo and range ro = R (the deuteron nuclear radius), where Vo >> thermal energy.    
(a)	 Solve the s-wave radial wave equation to obtain the dispersion relation that 
2 K 2  / 2m = Vo
involves the wavenumbers K, k and the phase shift δo (k ) , with  h
2 k 2  / 2m = E .  Denote this relation as equation (*). 
and 	 h
(b)  Define the scattering length a and find a from equation (*) [hint: you can take 
δo (k )  to be small]. 
(c)  Give a sketch of σo  as a function of Kro.  Discuss briefly and comment on  

whether your results in Problem 1 and 2 are consistent? 


Problem 3 (25%) 

Suppose in Problem 2 you replace the spherical barrier by a spherical well with depth Vo 
and the same range ro as before.  Without going through the calculation in detail again, find 
the dispersion relation using your result from Problem 2(a).  (In other words, how would 
you modify your equation (*)?)  Give a sketch of the cross section σo  versus Kro, and 
discuss any difference in cross section behavior between a well and a barrier. 

Problem 4 (15%) 

Suppose you are now interested in bound-state solutions to the radial wave equation for 
the neutron-proton system.  Without doing any detailed calculation (but you can point to 
any result in your calculations in Problems 1 through 3), what can you say about the 
existence of bound states for the two interactions in Problems 2 and 3?  (Explain the 
underlying reason why the two problems may be different.)
