Sample questions for Quiz 2, 22.101 (Fall 2006) 

Following questions were taken from quizzes given in previous years.  They are meant to give 
you an idea of the kind of questions (what was expected from the class in previous times) that 
have been asked in the past.  Percentage credit is indicated for each question based on 100% for a 
90-min quiz (closed book).  Problem numbering means nothing here.    

You will have to decide for yourself what connections, if any, there may be between these 
questions and the Quiz 2 that will be conducted on Nov. 15, 2006. 
____________________________________________________ 

Problem 1 (10%)  Among the energy levels of a central force potential is a level labeled 1d.  
Suppose we now add a spin-orbit interaction term to the Hamiltonian such as in the shell model.  
Using the spectroscopic notation, label the new levels that evolve from this 1d level.  Specify how 
many nucleons can go into each of the new levels, and explicitly write out the quantum numbers 
specifying the wave function of each nucleon. 

Problem 2 (10%)  In an odd-odd nucleus the last neutron and proton go into a 1d3/2 and a 1g9/2 
level respectively.  Use the shell model to predict the spin and parity of this nucleus.  

4 He  is 
6 Li  is about 5.3 Mev while that of  2
Problem 3(15%)  The binding energy per nucleon of  3
7.1 Mev.  Does this mean that the former is unstable against α− decay?  Explain.  (Note:  The 
binding energy of the deuteron  2H  is 2.25 Mev.) 

Problem 4 (15%) 

Explain briefly what is the reason for introducing the total momentum,  j = L + S , in the Nuclear 
Shell model.  How does this affect the labeling of the states? 

Problem 5 (15%) 

Since the binding energy per nucleon (B/A) of  2 He 4 , at 7.07 Mev, is higher than that of  3 Li 6 , at 
5.33 Mev, it may appear that the former is more stable than the latter and therefore Li6 should 
spontaneously undergo α -decay, 

Li 6 →  He 4 +  H 2

where the B/A of  1 H 2  is 1.11 Mev.  Determine whether this is indeed the case. 

Problem 6 (20%) 

3He + n  , has a Q-value of -0.764 Mev.  Tritium  3H  also undergoes β− 
The reaction,  3H + 1H→2
decay with end-point energy of 0.0185 Mev.  Find the difference between the neutron and 
hydrogen mass in Mev.  Draw an energy level diagram showing the levels involved in the 
reaction and the β−  decay, then indicate in your diagram the proton separation energy Sp, the Q-
value, and the end-point energy Tmax. 

Problem 7  (15%) 

Sketch the energy variations of the stopping power (energy loss per unit path) of both electrons 
and protons in lead (in the same figure).  Discuss all the features of these two curves that you 
know. 

Problem 8  (20%) 

On the basis of the Bethe-Bloch formula, the stopping power of a material for incident electrons 
(with kinetic energy  Te  ) can be related to that for incident alpha particles (with kinetic energy 
Tα ).  Denoting the two by  −( dT / dx )e  and  −( dT / dx )α  respectively, sketch the two curves on 
the same graph to show how knowing one allows you to find the other. 

Problem 9 (20%) 

In analyzing the energy loss per unit path length of a charged particle (ze) moving with speed v, 
an atomic electron in the medium located at an impact parameter b will gain an amount of kinetic 
energy equal to 

T  = 

2( ze 2 ) 2 
mv 2b 2 

from collision with the charged particle, where m is the electron mass.  Suppose you are told to 
ignore the binding energy of the atomic electrons, so that all the electron in a collision cylinder of 
radius b, thickness db, and length  ∆ x  are ejected.  Find the number of electrons per unit path 
length ejected with kinetic energy in dT about T.  (Hint:  Think of this number as a distribution.) 

Problem 10  (15%)   

At time t = 0 you are given an atom that can decay through either of two channels, a and b, with 
known decay constants λa  and λb .  Find the probability that it will decay by channel a during 
the time interval between  t1  and  t2  , with  t1  and  t2  arbitrary.  Interpret your result. 

Problem 11 (15%) 

The basic idea underlying the C14 dating method is that radioactive C14 is produced continuously 
in the atmosphere by cosmic rays and finds its way into living plants and animals by carbon 
exchange.  When the plant or animal dies the exchange process stops.  How would you use this 
idea to determine the age of an antique wooden chair (when the tree was cut), that is, what 
activity would you measure and how would you interpret the data?  Give a sketch of your 
method. (Note:  The equilibrium concentration of C14  in the air is a known constant.  C14 
undergoes β -decay to N14 which is stable.)   

Problem 12 (40% total, 5% each)) 

Discuss briefly the significance of each of the following.  Give a definition whenever it is 
appropriate.  (If you use the same notation as the Lecture Notes, you may assume the symbols are 
already defined in the Notes.) 

(a)  The asymmetry term in the empirical mass formula. 
(b)  Mass parabolas for isobars for even A (give a sketch). 
(c)  Mass or energy requirements for electron capture. 
(d)  Secular equilibrium in radioactive decay. 
(e)  Bragg curve for charged particles (give sketch). 
(f)  Bethe formula for stopping power and its relativistic corrections. 
(g)  Charge and mass dependence of bremsstrahlung intensity. 
(h)  Mass absorption coefficient for charged particles. 

Problem 13 (40% total, 8% each)  Give a short and concise answer to each of the following 
questions. 

(a)  Derive using a sketch the asymmetry term in the empirical mass formula. 

(b)  Explain what is β+ -decay, then state and justify the energy condition for this process. 

(c)  Sketch schematically the curve for the stopping power of a heavy charged particle in a 
high-Z medium in the energy range, zero to three times its rest mass energy.  Label all 
the characteristic energies that you know, and explain what physical processes are 
represented in the curve. 

(d)	

(e)	

 Show that the range of anα -particle and a proton, both having the same initial speed, 
will be approximately the same. 

Is bremsstrahlung an elastic or inelastic process (explain)?  Why is this process more 
important for electron than for proton in problems of interest to the class. 

Problem 14 (20%) 

Summarize briefly how the shell model is able to predict the magic numbers.  State only the most 
important steps (commensurate with how much time you have).  You can quote anything in the 
lecture notes without further explanation, such as the coupling of two angular momenta, their 
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, and the labeling of energy levels (so long as your expressions, 
figures and symbols are the same as in the lecture notes). 

Problem 15 (20%) 

(a)  Explain the usefulness of the Mass Parabola. 
(b)  Suppose you are asked to analyze the Mass Parabola using the empirical binding energy 
formula.  Show which is more important between the Coulomb term and the asymmetry 
term.  (The coefficients of the two terms are ac = 0.72 Mev and aa = 23.5 Mev.) 

Problem 16 (20%) 

Radioisotope B decays to C (decay constant λB ) which can undergo two decay processes, one 
'   and a competing process going to another nucleus E with 
going to a nucleus D with constant λC
constant λ"
C  .  Both D and E are stable.  Write down the equations describing the four nuclides 
NB(t), ..., NE(t) in the decay chain.  Solve the equations directly using the initial condition NB(t=0) 
o, NC(0) = ND(0)=NE(0)=0, and then demonstrate that your solutions are indeed correct.  
= NB

Problem 16 (25%) 

Show that alpha particles and protons having the same initial speed (high speed but 
nonrelativistic) have approximately the same range in any stopping material.   Examine the 
figure below to see which particle should have a slightly longer range.  Justify your answer.

Problem 17 (15%) 

  
Explain briefly under what conditions energy loss by radiation important is important.   Give a 
sketch of the mass absorption coefficients for electrons in the range (0, 5Mev), comparing two 
absorbers, Pb and Al.  Justify the relative magnitudes you have sketched.
