QUIZ No. 2 (closed book) 
Problem 1 (15%)
Consider a two-particle system comprising a neutron scattering from a proton. 
a)  Write the Hamiltonian for this system with the addition of a spin-spin coupling
term representing the interaction energy between the spin of the proton Sp  and the 
spin of the neutron Sn. (Hint: This should be very similar to the spin-orbit 
coupling we described for a nucleus). 
b)  Define a new operator S2
total  representing the total spin angular momentum of this 
system and use S2
total  to express the spin-spin coupling component of the 
Hamiltonian in terms of S2
total, S2
p, and S2
n. 
c)  For the Hamiltonian in part a) we could have expressed our eigenfunctions as
|sp,sn,mp,mn>. Based on your result in part b), choose a new set of eigenfunctions
that depends on the total spin angular momentum of the system. 
d)  Describe the implied constraints on the eigenvalues of the diagonalized operators
for this new set of eigenfunctions. 
Problem 2 (15%) 
a)  Sketch a nuclear potential well emphasizing the differences in the potential seen 
by neutrons and protons. Include a rough schematic of the energy levels for both
types of particle. 
b)  Use this sketch to derive the asymmetry term in the empirical mass formula. 
Problem 3 (15%)

Imagine a fictional universe where all nuclides follow a B/A curve of the form

B/A  = 
EB

=  0.1EB 

otherwise


with A2  > A1. 
a)  Draw a graph describing B/A vs. A and comment on the stability of the nuclides 
in the various regions of the graph. 
b)  Is/Are there region(s) of the graph where fission is favorable for isotopes in 
that/those region(s)? Explain. 
c)  Is/Are there region(s) of the graph where fusion is favorable for isotopes in 
that/those region(s)? Explain. 
Problem 4 (15%)
Consider a radioisotope that decays through β+  decay and electron capture with decay 
constants λβ  and λEC, respectively. An amount of this isotope is present at t=0. 
a)  What fraction of the nuclei present at t=0 will decay between arbitrary t1  and t2? 
b)  What fraction of the nuclei that decayed in part a will have done so via β+  decay?

between arbitrary t1 and t2? Note: This is not the same as part b. 
d)  Is your result in part c) reasonable? Interpret your result physically. 
Problem 5 (20%)
Discuss the stopping power of electrons in a high Z absorber.
i)  Sketch the stopping power of electrons in a high Z absorber such as lead over an 
energy range from zero to 10 times the rest mass energy. 
ii)  Explain the physical origin of all characteristic features. 
iii)  For portions of the curve where possible, give simple formulas describing the
shape of the curve. 
Problem 6 (20%) 
The solution to the Q-equation is given as 
and 

, where 

a)	 For an endothermic reaction with M4  > M1, what is the constraint on E3  for the 
described reaction to occur? 
b)	 From this constraint, what can you conclude about s and t?
