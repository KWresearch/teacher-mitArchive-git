We have just concluded the study of radiation interaction with matter in which the   
basic mechanisms of charged particle, neutron and gamma interactions were discussed 
separately.  A topic which makes use of all this information is the general problem of 
detection of nuclear radiation detection.  Although this subject properly belongs to a 
course dealing with experimental aspects of applied nuclear physics, it is nevertheless 
appropriate to make contact with it at this point in the course.  There are two reasons for 
this.  First, radiation detection is a central part of the foundational knowledge for all 
students in the department of Nuclear Science and Engineering.  Even though we cannot 
do justice to it due to the limited time remaining in the syllabus, it is worthwhile to make 
some contact with it, however brief.  Secondly, an analysis of the features observed 
experimentally in pulse-height spectra of gamma radiation is timely given what we have 
just learned about the γ -interaction processes of Compton scattering, photoelectric effect 
and pair production. 
We start by noting that regardless of the type of nuclear radiation, the interactions 
taking place in a material medium invariably result in ionization and excitation which 
then can be detected.  Heavy charged particles and electrons produce ion pairs in 
ionization chambers, or light emission (excitation of atoms) in scintillation counters, or 
electron-hole pairs in semiconductor detectors.  Neutrons collide with protons which 
recoil and produce ionization or excitation.  In the case of gammas, all 3 processes we 
have just discussed give rise to energetic electrons which in turn cause ionization or 
excitation.  Thus the basic mechanisms of nuclear radiation detection involve measuring 
the ionization or excitation occurring in the detector in a way to allow one to deduce the 
energy of the incoming radiation.  A useful summary of the different types of detectors 
and methods of detection is given in the following table  [from Meyerhof, p. 107].

We focus on detection of γ radiation.  Suppose we are concerned with the 
problem of detecting two γ rays, at energies 1.37 Mev and 2.75 Mev, emitted from the 
radioactive Na24.  The measurements are in the form of pulse-height spectra, number of 
counts per channel in a multichannel analyzer plotted against the pulse height, as shown 
in Fig. 19.1.  These are the results obtained by using a detector in the form of  Na-I 
scintillation detector.  The spectra are seen to have two sets of features, one for each 
incident γ .  By a set we mean a photopeak at the incident energy, a Compton edge at an 
energy approximately 0.25 Mev (mec2/2) below the incident energy, and two so-called 
escape peaks denoted as P1 and P2.  The escape peaks refer to pair production processes 
where either one or both annihilation photons escape detection by leaving the counter.

Thus, P1 should be 0.511 Mev below the incident energy and P2 should be 0.511 Mev 
below P1.  The other features that can be seen in Fig. 19.1 are a peak at 0.511 Mev, 
clearly to be identified as the annihilation photon, a backscattered peak associated with 
Compton scattering at θ = π which should be positioned at mec2/2, and finally an 
unidentified peak which we can attribute to x-rays emitted from excited atoms. 
One can notice in Fig. 19.1 that the various peaks are quite broad.  This is a 
known characteristic of the scintillation detector, namely, relatively poor energy 
resolution.  In contrast, a semiconductor detector, such as Li-drifted Ge, would have 
much higher energy resolution, as can be seen in Fig. 19.2.  In addition to the sharper 
lines, one should notice that the peaks measured using the semiconductor detector have 
different relative intensities compared to the peaks obtained using the scintillation 
detector.  In particular, looking at the relative intensities of P1 and P2, we see that P1 > 
P2 in Fig. 19.1, whereas the opposite holds, P2 > P1, in Fig. 19.2.

This difference can be explained by noting that the scintillation detector is larger in 
physical size than the semiconductor detector.  In this particular case the former is a 
cylinder 7.6 cm in diameter and 7.6 cm in length, whereas the latter is 1.9 cm in diameter 
and 0.5 cm in height.  Thus one can expect that the probability that a photon will escape 
from the detector can be quite different in these two cases. 
To follow up on this idea, let us define P as the probability of escape.  In a one-
dimensional situation  P ~ e −µx  , where µ is the linear attenuation coefficient and x is the 
dimension of the detector.  Now the probability that one of the two annihilation gammas 
will escape is P1 = 2P(1-P), the factor of 2 coming from the fact that either gamma can 
escape.  For both gammas to escape the probability is P2 = P2.  So we see that whether P1 
is larger or smaller than P2 depends on the magnitude of P.  If P is small, P1 > P2, but if 
P is close to unity, then P2 > P1.  For the two detectors in question, it is to be expected 
that P is larger for the semiconductor detector.  Without putting in actual numbers we can 
infer from an inspection of Figs 19.1 and 19.2 that P is small enough in the case of the 
scintillation detector for P1 to be larger than P2, and also P is close enough to unity in the 
case of the semiconductor detector for P2 to be larger than P1.
