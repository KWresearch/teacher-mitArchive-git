We will now extend the bound-state calculation to three-dimensional systems.  
The problem we want to solve is essentially the same as before, except that we wish to 
determine the bound-state energy levels and corresponding wave functions for a particle 
in a three-dimensional spherical well potential.  Although this is a three-dimensional 
potential, we can take advantage of its symmetry in angular space and reduce the 
calculation to an equation still involving only one variable, the radial distance between 
the particle position and the origin.  In other words, the spherical potential is still a 
function of one variable, 

V (r ) = −Vo

r < ro

= 0 

otherwise 

 

(4.1) 

Here r is the radial position of the particle relative to the origin.  Any potential that is a 
function only of r, the magnitude of the position r and not the position vector itself, is 
called a central-force potential.  As we will see, this form of the potential makes the 
solution of the Schrödinger wave equation particularly simple.  For a system where the 
potential or interaction energy has no angular dependence, one can reformulate the 
problem by factorizing the wave function into a component that involves only the radial 
coordinate and another component that involves only the angular coordinates.  The wave 
equation is then reduced to a system of uncoupled one-dimensional equations, each 
describing a radial component of the wave function.  As to the justification for using a 

1 

central-force potential for our discussion, this will depend on which properties of the 
nucleus we wish to study. 
We again begin with the time-independent wave equation

Since the potential function has spherical symmetry, it is natural for us to carry out the 
analysis in the spherical coordinate system rather than the Cartesian system.  A position 
vector r then is specified by the radial coordinate r and two angular coordinates, θ and 
ϕ , the polar and azimuthal angles respectively, see Fig. 1.  In this coordinate system

coordinate r, and polar and azimuthal angles θ and ϕ .

(4.6)


For any potential V(r) the angular variation of ψ is always determined by the operator 
L2/2mr2.  Therefore one can study the operator L2 separately and then use its properties to 
simplify the solution of (4.6).  This needs to be done only once, since the angular 
variation is independent of whatever form one takes for V(r).  It turns out that L2 is very 
well known (it is the square of L which is the angular momentum operator); it is the 
operator that describes the angular motion of a free particle in three-dimensional space. 
We first summarize the basic properties of L2 before discussing any physical 
interpretation.  It can be shown that the eigenfunction of L2 are the spherical harmonics 
functions,  Y

with Po(x) = 1, P1(x) = x, P2(x) = (3x2 – 1)/2, P3(x) = (5x3-3x)/2, etc.  Special functions 
m  and  P
like  Y
m  are quite extensively discussed in standard texts [see, for example, 
l 
l 
Schiff, p.70] and reference books on mathematical functions [More and Feshbach, p. 
1264].  For our purposes it is sufficient to regard them as well known and tabulated 
quantities like sines and cosines, and whenever the need arises we will invoke their 
special properties as given in the mathematical handbooks. 
m (θ ,ϕ)  is an eigenfunction of L2 with corresponding 
It is clear from (4.7) that  Y
l 
2  .  Since the angular momentum of the particle, like its energy, is 
eigenvalue  l(l + 1)h
quantized, the index  l  can take on only positive integral values or zero, 

l  = 0, 1, 2, 3, … 

Similarly, the index m can have integral values from - l  to  l , 

m = - l , - l +1, …, -1, 0, 1, …,  l -1,  l 

For a given  l , there can be 2 l +1 values of m.  The significance of m can be seen from 
the property of Lz, the projection of the orbital angular momentum vector L along a 
certain direction in space (in the absence of any external field, this choice is up to the 
observer).  Following convention we will choose this direction to be along the z-axis of 
our coordinate system, in which case the operator Lz has the representation, 
L = −ih∂ / ∂ϕ , and its eignefunctions are also  Y
m (θ,ϕ) , with eigenvalues  mh .  The
z 
l 
indices  l  and m are called quantum numbers. Since the angular space is two-dimensional 

4 

(corresponding to two degrees of freedom), it is to be expected that two quantum 
numbers will emerge from our analysis.  By the same token we should expect three 
quantum numbers in our description of three-dimensional systems.  We should regard the 
particle as existing in various states which are specified by a unique set of quantum 
numbers, each one is associated with a certain orbital angular momentum which has a 
definite magnitude and orientation with respect to our chosen direction along the z-axis.  
The particular angular momentum state is described by the function  Y
m (θ ,ϕ)  with  l 
l 
known as the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and m the magnetic quantum 
number.  It is useful to keep in mind that  Y
m (θ ,ϕ)  is actually a rather simple function for 
l 
low order indices.  For example, the first four spherical harmonics are: 

0  =  3 / 4π cosθ ,  Y1
−1  =  3 / 8π e − iϕ sinθ ,  Y1
0  = 1 /  4π ,  Y1 
1  =  3 / 8π e iϕ sinθ 
Y0

Two other properties of the spherical harmonics are worth mentioning.  First is 
that { Y
m (θ ,ϕ) }, with  l  = 0, 1, 2, … and  − l ≤ m ≤ l , is a complete set of functions in 
l 
the space of  0 ≤ θ ≤ π and  0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 2π in the sense that any arbitrary function of θ and 
ϕ can be represented by an expansion in these functions.  Another property is 
orthonormality,

(4.11) 

ll '  denotes the Kronecker delta function; it is unity when the two subscripts are 
where δ
equal, otherwise the function is zero. 
Returning to the wave equation (4.6) we look for a solution as an expansion of the 
wave function in spherical harmonics series,

Because of (4.7) the L2 operator in (4.6) can be replaced by the factor  l(l + 1)h
 
2 .  In 
view of (4.11) we can eliminate the angular part of the problem by multiplying the wave 
equation by the complex conjugate of a spherical harmonic and integrating over all solid 
angles (recall an element of solid angle is  sinθdθdϕ ), obtaining

(4.13)

This is an equation in one variable, the radial coordinate r, although we are treating a 
three-dimensional problem.  We can make this equation look like a one-dimensional 
problem by transforming the dependent variable  R

(4.15)

We will call (4.15) the radial wave equation.  It is the basic starting point of three-
dimensional problems involving a particle interacting with a central potential field. 
We observe that (4.15) is actually a system of uncoupled equations, one for each 
fixed value of the orbital angular momentum quantum number  l .  With reference to the 
wave equation in one dimension, the extra term involving  l(l + 1)  in (4.15) represents the 
contribution to the potential field due to the centrifugal motion of the particle.  The 1/r2 
dependence makes the effect particularly important near the origin; in other words, 
centrigfugal motion gives rise to a barrier which tends to keep the particle away from the 
origin.  This effect is of course absent in the case of  l  = 0, a state of zero orbital angular 
momentum, as one would expect.  The first few  l  states usually are the only ones of 
interest in our discussion (because they tend to have the lowest energies); they are given 
special spectroscopic designations,

where the first four letters stand for ‘sharp’, ‘principal’, ‘diffuse’, and ‘fundamental’ 
respectively.  After f the letters are assigned in alphabetical order, as in h, i, j, …  The 
wave function describing the state of orbital angular momentum  l  is often called the  l th 
partial wave,

(4.16)

 

Notice that in the case of s-wave the wave function is spherically symmetric since  Y0
0  is 
independent of θ and ϕ . 

Interpretation of Orbital Angular Momentum  
In classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle in motion is defined 
as the vector product,  L = r × p , where r is the particle position and p its linear 

momentum.  L is directed along the axis of rotation (right-hand rule), as shown in Fig. 2.   

Fig. 2.  Angular momentum of a particle at position r moving with linear momentum p 
(classical definition). 

L is called an axial or pseudovector in contrast to r and p, which are polar vectors.  Under 
inversion,  r → −r , and  p → − p , but  L → L .  Quantum mechanically, L2 is an operator 

with eigenvalues and eigenfunctions given in (4.7).  Thus the magnitude of L is 
, with  l  = 0, 1, 2, …being the orbital angular momentum quantum number.  
(  +llh 
)1
We can specify the magnitude and one Cartesian component (usually called the z­

7 

component) of L by specifying  l  and m, an example is shown in Fig. 3.  What about the 
x- and y-components?  They are undetermined, in that they cannot be observed  

Fig. 3.  The  l(l + 1) = 5 projections along the z-axis of an orbital angular momentum with 
 
h6 .
l  = 2.  Magnitude of L is 

simultaneously with the observation of L2 and Lz.  Another useful interpretation is to look 
at the energy conservation equation in terms of radial and tangential motions.  By this we 
mean that the total energy can be written as

where the decomposition into radial and tangential velocities is depicted in Fig. 4. 
Eq.(4.17) can be compared with the radial wave equation (4.15).

Thus far we have confined our discussions of the wave equation to its solution in 
spherical coordinates.  There are situations where it will be more appropriate to work in 
another coordinate system.  As a simple example of a bound-state problem, we can 
consider the system of a free particle contained in a cubical box of dimension L along 
each side.  In this case it is clearly more convenient to write the wave equation in 
Cartesian coordinates,

(4.17)

0 <x, y, z < L.  The boundary conditions are ψ = 0 whenever x, y, or z is 0 or L.  Since 
both the equation and the boundary conditions are separable in the three coordinates, the 
solution is of the product form, 

ψ ( xyz ) =ψ n x  ( x)ψ n y  ( y )ψ n z  ( z ) 

=  (2 / L) 3 / 2  sin(n πx / L) sin(n yπy / L) sin(n πz / L)

(4.19)

 

We see that the wave functions and corresponding energy levels are specified by the set 
of three quantum numbers (nx, nx, nz).  While each state of the system is described by a 
unique set of quantum numbers, there can be more than one state at a particular energy 
level.  Whenever this happens, the level is said to be degenerate.  For example, (112), 

9 

(121), and (211) are three different states, but they are all at the same energy, so the level 
at  6(hπ) 2  / 2mL2  is triply degenerate.  The concept of degeneracy is useful in our later 
discussion of the nuclear shell model where one has to determine how many nucleons can 
be put into a certain energy level.  In Fig. 6 we show the energy level diagram for a 
particle in a cubical box.  Another way to display the information is through a table, such 
as Table I.

The energy unit is seen to be  ∆E  = (hπ ) 2  / 2mL2 .  We can use this expression to estimate 
the magnitude of the energy levels for electrons in an atom, for which m = 9.1 x10-28 gm 
and L ~ 3 x 10-8cm, and for nucleons in a nucleus, for which m = 1.6x10-24 gm and L ~ 
5F.  The energies come out to be ~30 ev and 6 Mev respectively, values which are typical 
in atomic and nuclear physics.  Notice that if an electron were in a nucleus, then it would 
have energies of the order 1010 ev ! 
In closing this section we note that Bohr had put forth the “correspondence 
principle” which states that quantum mechanical results will approach the classical 
results when the quantum numbers are large.  Thus we have

(4.20)

 

What this means is that the probability of finding a particle anywhere in the box is 1/L, 
i.e., one has a uniform distribution, see Fig. 7.

Parity 

Parity is a symmetry property of the wave function associated with the inversion 
operation.  This operation is one where the position vector r is reflected through the 
origin (see Fig. 1), so  r → −r .  For physical systems which are not subjected to an 
external vector field, we expect these systems will remain the same under an inversion 

11 

 

 

operation, or the Hamiltonian is invariant under inversion.  If ψ(r )  is a solution to the 
wave equation, then applying the inversion operation we get 

Hψ(−r ) = Eψ (−r ) 

 

 

 

 

(4.21)

which shows that ψ (−r )  is also a solution.  A general solution is therefore obtained by 
adding or subtracting the two solutions, 

H [ψ(r ) ±ψ (−r )] = E [ψ (r ) ±ψ (−r )] 

 

 

 

(4.22)

Since the function ψ+ (r ) =ψ (r ) +ψ (−r )  is manifestly invariant under inversion, it is 
said to have positive parity, or its parity, denoted by the symbol π , is +1.  Similarly, 
ψ− (r ) =ψ (r ) −ψ (−r )  changes sign under inversion, so it has negative parity, or π = -1. 
The significance of (4.22) is that a physical solution of our quantum mechanical 
description should have definite parity; this is the condition we have previously imposed 
on our solutions in solving the wave equation (see Lec3).  Notice that there are functions 
which do not have definite parity, for example, Asinkx + Bcoskx.  This is the reason that 
we take either the sine function or the cosine function for the interior solution in Lec3.  In 
general, one can accept a solution as a linear combination of individual solutions all 
having the same parity.  A linear combination of solutions with different parities has no 
definite parity, and is therefore unacceptable. 
In spherical coordinates, the inversion operation of changing r to –r is equivalent 
to changing the polar angle θ  to π −θ , and the azimuthal angle ϕ to ϕ +π .  The effect 

m (θ ,ϕ) ~ e imϕ P
of the transformation on the spherical harmonic function  Y
m (θ )  is 
l

e imϕ → e imϕ e imπ = (−1) m e imϕ 

m (θ ) → (−1) l −m P
P

l 

12 

so the parity of  Y
m (θ ,ϕ)  is  (−1) l  .  In other words, the parity of a state with a definite 
l 
orbital angular momentum is even if  l  is even, and odd if  l  is odd.  All eigenfunctions 
of the Hamiltonian with a spherically symmetric potential are therefore either even or odd 
in parity.
