Since a neutron has no charge it can easily enter into a nucleus and cause a 
reaction.  Neutrons interact primarily with the nucleus of an atom, except in the special 
case of magnetic scattering where the interaction involves the neutron spin and the 
magnetic moment of the atom.  Because magnetic scattering is of no interest in this class, 
we can neglect the interaction between neutrons and electrons and think of atoms and 
nuclei interchangeably.  Neutron reactions can take place at any energy, so one has to pay 
particular attention to the energy variation of the interaction cross section.  In a nuclear 
reactor neutrons can have energies ranging from 10-3 ev (1 mev) to 107 ev (10 Mev). This 
means our study of neutron interactions, in principle, will have to cover an energy range 
of 10 ten orders of magnitude.  In practice we will limit ourselves to two energy ranges, 
the slowing down region (ev to Kev) and the thermal region (around 0.025 ev). 
For a given energy region â€“ thermal, epithermal, resonance, fast â€“ not all the 
possible reactions are equally important.  Which reaction is important depends on the 
target nucleus and the neutron energy.  Generally speaking the important types of 
interactions, in the order of increasing complexity from the standpoint of theoretical 
understanding, are: 
(n,n) â€“ elastic scattering.  There are two processes, potential scattering which is 
neutron interaction at the surface of the nucleus (no penetration) as in a billiard 
ball-like collision, and resonance scattering which involves the formation and 
decay of a compound nucleus. 
(n,J ) -- radiative capture.

(n,nâ€™) -- inelastic scattering.  This reaction involves the excitation of nuclear 
levels.
(n,p), (n, D ), â€¦ -- charged particle emission. 
(n,f) -- fission. 
If we were interested in fission reactors, the reactions in the order of importance 
would be fission, capture (in fuel and other reactor materials), scattering (elastic and 
inelastic), and fission product decay by E -emission. In this lecture we will mostly study 
elastic (or potential) scattering.  The other reactions all involve compound nucleus 
formation, a process we will discuss briefly around the end of the semester. 

The Q-Equation 
Consider the reaction, sketched in Fig. 15.1, where an incoming particle, labeled 
1, collides with a target nucleus (2), resulting in the emission of an outgoing particle (3), 
with the residual nucleus (4) recoiling.  For simplicity we assume the target nucleus to be 

Fig. 15.1.  A two-body collision between incident particle 1 and target particle 2, which 
is at rest, leading to the emission of particle 3 at an angle T and a recoiling residual 
particle 4. 

at rest, E2 = 0.  This is often a good approximation because for a target at room 
temperature E2 is 0.025 ev; except for incoming neutrons in the thermal energy region, E1 
typically will be much greater than E2.  We will derive an equation relating the outgoing 
energy E3 to the outgoing angle T using the conservation of total energy and linear 
momentum, and non-relativistic kinematics,

which is known as the Q-equation.  Notice that the energies Ei and angle T are in the 
laboratory coordinate system (LCS), while Q is independent of coordinate system (since 
Q can be expressed in terms of masses which of course do not depend on coordinate 
system).  A typical situation is when the incident energy E1, the masses (and therefore Q-
value) are all known, and one is interested in solving (15.5) for E3 in terms of  cosT , or 
vice versa. 
Eq. (15.5) is actually not an equation for determining the Q-value; this is already 
known because all four particles in the reaction and their rest masses are prescribed 

3 

beforehand.  What then is the quantity that one can solve (15.5) to obtain?  We should 
think of the Q-equation as a relation connecting the 12 degrees of freedom in any two-
body collision problem, where two particles collide (as reactants) to give rise to two other 
particles (as products).  The problem is completely specified when the velocities of the 
fours particles, or 12 degrees of freedom (each velocity has 3 degrees of freedom), are 
determined.  Clearly not every single degree of freedom is an unknown in the situations 
of interest to us.  Suppose we enumerate all the degrees of freedom to see which is given 
(known) and which is a variable.  First if the direction of travel and energy of the 
incoming particle are given, usually the case, this specifies 3 degrees of freedom. 
Secondly it is customary to take the target nucleus to be stationary, so another 3 degrees 
of freedom are specified.  Since conservations of energy and momentum must hold in any 
collision (three conditions since momentum and energy are related), this leaves three 
degrees of freedom that are not specified in the problem.  If we further assume the 
emission of the outgoing particle (particle 3) is azimuthally symmetric (that is, emission 
is equally probably into a cone subtended by the angle T ), then only two degree of 
freedom are left.  This way of counting shows that the outcome of the collision is 
completely determined if we just specify another degree of freedom.  What variable 
should we take?   Because we are often interested in knowing the energy or direction of 
travel of the outgoing particle, we can choose this last variable to be either E3 or the 
scattering angle T .  In other words, if we know either E3 or T , then everything else 
(energy and direction) about the collision is determined.  Keeping this in mind, it should 
come as no surprise that what we will do with (15.5) is to turn it into a relation between 
E3 andT . 
Thus far we have used non-relativistic expressions for the kinematics.  To turn 
(15.5) into the relativistic Q-equation we can simply replace the rest mass Mi by an 
eff  M i   Ti  / 2c 2  , and use the expression  p 2
2MT   T 2 / c 2  instead 
effective mass, M i
2ME .  For photons, we take  M eff 
hQ / 2c 2 .

Inspection of (15.5) shows that it is a quadratic equation in the variable x =  E3 . 

An equation of the form  ax 2   bx  c  0  has two roots,

which means there are in general two possible solutions to the Q-equation,  r  E3 .  For a 
solution to be physically acceptable, it must be real and positive.  Thus there are 
situations where the Q-equation gives one, two, or no physical solutions [cf. Evans, pp. 
413-415, Meyerhof, p. 178].  For our purposes we will focus on neutron collisions, in 
particular the case of elastic (Q = 0) and inelastic (Q < 0) neutron scattering.  We will 
examine these two processes briefly and then return to a more detailed discussion of 
elastic scattering in the laboratory and center-of-mass coordinate systems. 

Elastic vs. Inelastic Scattering 
Elastic scattering is the simplest process in neutron interactions; it can be 
analyzed in complete detail.  This is also an important process because it is the primary 
mechanism by which neutrons lose energy in a reactor, from the instant they are emitted 
as fast neutrons in a fission event to when they appear as thermal neutrons.  In this case, 
there is no excitation of the nucleus, Q = 0; whatever energy is lost by the neutron is 
gained by the recoiling target nucleus.  Let M1 = M3 = m (Mn), and M2 = M4 = M = Am. 
Then (15.5) becomes

Suppose we ask under what condition is E3 = E1?  We see that this can occur only when 
T = 0, corresponding to forward scattering (no interaction).  For all finite T , E3 has to be 
less than E1, which is reasonable because some energy has to be given to the energy of 
recoil, E4.  One can show that the maximum energy loss by the neutron occurs at T S , 
which corresponds to backward scattering,

Eq.(15.7) is the starting point for the analysis of neutron moderation (slowing down) in a 
scattering medium.  We will return to it later in this lecture. 
Inelastic scattering is the process by which the incoming neutron excites the 
target nucleus so it leaves the ground state and goes to an excited state at an energy E* 
above the ground state.  Thus Q = -E* (E* > 0).  We again let the neutron mass be m and 
the target nucleus mass be M (ground state) or M* (excited state), with M* = M + E*/c2. 
Since this is a reaction with negative Q, it is an endothermic process requiring energy to 
be supplied before the reaction can take place.  In the case of scattering the only way 
energy can be supplied is through the kinetic energy of the incoming particle (neutron). 
Suppose we ask what is minimum energy required for the reaction, the threshold energy? 
To find this, we look at the situation where no energy is given to the outgoing particle, E3 
~0 and T ~ 0.  Then (15.5) gives

 or

(15.9)

where we have denoted the minimum value of E1 as Eth.  Thus we see the minimum 
kinetic energy required for reaction is always greater than the excitation energy of the 
nucleus.  Where does the difference between Eth and E* go?  The answer is that it goes 
into the center-of-mass energy, the fraction of the kinetic energy of the incoming neutron 
(in the laboratory coordinate) that is not available for reaction. 

Relations between Outgoing Energy and Scattering Angle 
We return to the Q-equation for elastic scattering to obtain a relation between the 
energy of the outgoing neutron, E3, and the angle of scattering, T .  Again regarding 
(15.5) as a quadratic equation for the variable  E3  , we have

(15.11)

This is a perfectly good relation between E3 and T (with E1 fixed), although it is not a 
simple one.  Nonetheless, it shows a one-to-one correspondence between these two 
variables.  This is what we meant when we said that the problem is reduced to only 
degree of freedom.  Whenever we are given either E3 or T we can immediately determine 
the other variable.  The reason we said that (15.11) is not a simple relation is that we can 
obtain another relation between energy and scattering angle, except in this case the 
scattering angle is the angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system (CMCS), whereas T 
in (15.11) is the scattering angle in the laboratory coordinate system (LCS).  To find this 
simpler relation we first review the connection the two coordinate systems. 

Relation between LCS and CMCS 
Suppose we start with the velocities of the incoming neutron and target nucleus, 
and those of the outgoing neutron and recoiling nucleus as shown in the Fig. 15.2.

Figure by MIT OCW. 

In this diagram we denote the LCS and CMCS velocities by lower and upper cases 
respectively, so Vi = vi â€“ vo, where vo = [1/(A+1)]v1 is the velocity of the center-of-mass.  
Notice that the scattering angle in CMCS is labeled as T .  We see that in LCS the center-
c 
of-mass moves in the direction of the incoming neutron (with the target nucleus at rest), 
whereas in CMCS the target nucleus moves toward the center-of-mass which is stationary 
by definition.  One can show (in a problem set) that in CMCS the post-collision velocities 
have the same magnitude as the pre-collision velocities, the only effect of the collision 
being a rotation, from V1 to V3, and V2 to V4. 
Part (c) of Fig. 15.1 is particularly useful for deriving the relations between LCS 
and CMCS velocities and angles.  Perhaps the most important relation is that between the 
outgoing speed v3 and the scattering angle in CMCS , T .  We can write

where  D >( A  1) /( A  1)@2  .  Compared to (15.11), (15.13) is clearly simpler to 
manipulate.  These two relations must be equivalent since no approximations have been 
made in either derivation.  Taking the square of (15.11) gives

To demonstrate the equivalence of (15.13) and (15.14) one needs a relation between the

The relations (15.13), (15.14), and (15.15) all demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence 
between energy and angle or angle and angle.  They can be used to transform 
distributions from one variable to another, as we will demonstrate in the discussion of 
energy and angular distribution of elastically scattered neutrons in the following lecture.
