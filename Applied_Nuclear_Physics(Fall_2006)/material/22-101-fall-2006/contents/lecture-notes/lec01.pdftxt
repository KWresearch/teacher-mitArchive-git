General Remarks: 

This subject treats foundational knowledge for all students in the Department of Nuclear 
Science and Engineering.  Over the years 22.101 has evolved in the hands of several 
instructors, each of whom dealt with the subject contents in somewhat different fashions.  
Two topics, in particular, were not given the same treatment by the different faculty who 
have taught 22.101, quantum mechanics and the interaction of radiation with matter.  
There was also some difference in how much nuclear structure and nuclear models were 
taught from the perspective of a course on nuclear physics in a physics department. 
In the present version of 22.101 we intend to emphasize the nuclear concepts, as 
opposed to traditional nuclear physics, essential for understanding nuclear radiations and 
their interactions with matter.  The justification for is that we see our students as nuclear 
engineers rather than nuclear physicists.  Nuclear engineers work with all kinds of 
nuclear devices, from fission and fusion reactors to accelerators and detection systems.  
In all these complex systems nuclear radiations play a central role.  In generating nuclear 
radiations and using them for beneficial purposes, scientists and engineers must 
understand the properties of these radiations and how they interact with their 
surroundings.  It is through the control of radiations interactions that we can develop new 
devices or optimize existing ones to make them more safe, powerful, durable, or 
economical.  This is the simple reason why radiation interaction is the essence of 22.101. 

1 

Because nuclear physics is a very large subject and in view of our focus on 
radiation interactions, we will not be covering some of the standard material on nuclear 
structure and models that would be normally treated in a physics course.  Students 
interested in these topics are encouraged to read up on your own.  We should also note 
that in 22.101 we will study the different types of reactions as single-collision 
phenomena, described through variouscross sections, and leave the accumulated effects 
of many collisions to later subjects (22.105 and 22.106).  Although we will not teach 
quantum mechanics by itself, it is used in several descriptions of nuclei, at a more 
introductory level than in 22.51 and 22.106. 

Nomenclature: 

X A  denotes a nuclide, a specific nucleus with Z number of protons (Z = atomic
z 
number) and A number of nucleons (neutrons or protons).  The symbol of nucleus is X 
which is either a single letter as in uranium U, or two letters as in copper Cu or plutonium 
Pu.  There is a one-to-one correspondence  between Z and X, so that specifying both is 
actually redundant (but helpful since not everyone remembers the atomic number of all 
the elements).  The number of neutrons N of this nucleus is A – Z.  Often it is sufficient 
to specify only X and A, as in U235, if the nucleus is a familiar one (uranium is well 
known to have Z=92).  The symbol A is called the mass number since knowing the 
number of nucleons one has an approximate idea of what is the mass of the particular 
nucleus.  There exist several uranium nuclides with different mass numbers, such as U233, 
U235, and U238 .  Nuclides with the same Z but different A are called isotopes.  By the 
same token, nuclides with the same A but different Z are called isobars, and nuclides 
with same N but different Z are called isotones.  Isomers are nuclides with the same Z 
and A in different excited states.  For a compilation of the nuclides that are known, see 
the Table of Nuclides (Kaeri) for which a website is given in the References. 
We are, in principle, interested in all the elements up to Z = 94 (plutonium).  
There are about 20 more elements which are known, most with very short lifetimes; these 
are of interest mostly to nuclear physicists and chemists, but not so much to nuclear 
engineers.  While each element can have several isotopes of significant abundance, not 

2 

all the elements are of equal interest to us in this class.  The number of nuclides we might 
encounter in our studies is probably no more than 20. 
A great deal is known about the properties of nuclides.  In addition to the Table of 
Nuclides, the student can consult the Table of Isotopes, cited in the References.  It should 
be appreciated that the great interest in nuclear structure and reactions is not just for 
scientific knowledge alone; the fact that there are two applications that affects the welfare 
of our society – nuclear power and nuclear weapons – has everything to do with it.   
We begin our studies with a review of the most basic physical attributes of 
nuclides to provide motivation and a basis to introduce what we want to accomplish in 
this course (see the Lecture Outline). 

Basic Physical Attributes of Nuclides 

Nuclear Mass

We adopt the unified scale where the mass of C12 is exactly 12.  On this scale, one mass 

unit 1 mu (C12 = 12) = M(C12)/12 = 1.660420 x 10-24 gm (= 931.478 Mev), where M(C12) 

is actual mass of the nuclide C12.  Studies of atomic masses by mass spectrograph shows  

that a nuclide has a mass nearly equal to the mass number A times the proton mass.   

Three important rest mass values, in mass and energy units, to keep handy are: 

                                 mu  [M(C12) = 12]

Reason we care about the mass is that it is an indication of the stability of the nuclide. 
One sees this directly from E = Mc2, the higher the mass the higher the energy and the 
less stable is the nuclide (think of nuclide being in an excited state).  We will find that if a 
nuclide can lower its energy by undergoing disintegration, it will do so – this is the 
simple explanation of radioactivity.  Notice the proton is lighter than the neutron, 
suggesting the former is more stable than the latter.  Indeed, if the neutron is not bound in 

3 

a nucleus (that is, it is a free neutron) it will decay into a proton plus an electron (plus an 

antineutrino) with a half-life of about 13 min. 

Nuclear masses have been determined to quite high accuracy, precision of ~ 1 part in 108, 

by the methods of mass spectrography and energy measurements in nuclear reactions.  

Using the mass data alone we can get an idea of the stability of nuclides.  Define the mass 

defect as the difference between the actual mass of a nuclide and its mass number,  ∆  = 

M – A; it is also called the “mass decrement”.  If we plot  ∆  versus A, we get a curve 

sketched in Fig. 1.  When  ∆  < 0, it means that taking the individual nucleons when

the range ~ (20-180) should be stable. 

they are separated far from each other to make the nucleus gives a product whose mass is 
lighter than the sum of the components.  This can only happen if energy is given off 
during the formation.  In other words, to reach a final state (the product nuclide) with 
smaller mass than the initial state (collection of individual nucleons) one must take away 
some energy (mass).  It also follows that the final state will be more stable than the initial 
state, since energy must be put back in if one wants to reverse the process to go from the 
nuclide to the individual nucleons.  We therefore expect that  ∆  < 0 means the nuclide is 
stable.  Conversely,  ∆  > 0 means the nuclide is unstable.  Our sketch shows that very 
light elements (A < 20) and heavy elements (A > 180) are not stable, and that maximum 
stability occurs around A ~ 50.  We will return to discuss this behavior further when we 
consider the nuclear binding energy later.  

Nuclear Size 

4 

According to Thomson’s “electron” model of the nucleus (~ 1900), the size of a nucleus 
should be about an Angstrom, 10-8 cm.  We now know this picture is wrong.  The correct 
nuclear size was determined by Rutherford (~ 1911) in his atomic nucleus hypothesis 
which put the size at about 10-12 cm.  Nuclear radius is not well defined, strictly speaking, 
because any result of a measurement depends on the phenomenon involved (different 
experiments give different results).  On the other hand, all the results agree qualitatively 
and to some extent also quantitatively.  Roughly speaking, we will take the nuclear radius 
to vary with the 1/3 power of the mass number, R = roA1/3, with ro ~ 1.2 – 1.4 x 10-13 cm.  
The lower value of the coefficient ro  comes from electron scattering which probes the 
charge distribution of the nucleus, while the higher value comes from nuclear scattering 
which probes the range of nuclear force.  Since nuclear radii have magnitudes of the 
order of 10-13 cm, it is conventional to adopt a length unit called Fermi (F), F  ≡  10-13 cm. 
Because of particle-wave duality we associate a wavelength with the momentum of a 
particle.  The corresponding wave is called the deBroglie wave.  Before discussing the 
connection between a wave property, the wavelength, and a particle property, the 
momentum, let us first set down the relativistic kinematic relations between mass, 
momentum and energy of a particle with arbitrary velocity.  Consider a particle with rest 
mass mo moving with velocity v.  There are two expressions we can write down for the 
total energy E of this particle.  One is the sum of its kinetic energy Ekin and its rest mass 
energy,  E o  = mo c 2 , 

E tot  = E kin  + E o  = m(v)c 2 

 

 

 

 

(1.1)

 

The second equality introduces the relativistic mass m(v) which depends on its velocity, 

m(v) = γmo  ,  γ = (1 − v 2 / c 2 ) −1 / 2 

(1.2) 

where γ is the Einstein factor.  To understand (1.2) one should look into the Lorentz 
transformation and the special theory of relativity in any text.  Eq.(1.1) is a first-order 
relation for the total energy.  Another way to express the total energy is a second-order 
relation 

5 

 

 

E 2  = c 2  p 2  + E o 
2 

 

 

 

 

(1.3)

where p = m(v)v is the momentum of the particle.  Eqs. (1.1) – (1.3) are the general 
relations between the total and kinetic energies, mass, and momentum.  We now 
introduce the deBroglie wave by defining its wavelength λ in terms of the momentum of 
the corresponding particle, 

λ= h / p 

 

 

 

 

(1.4)

where h is the Planck’s constant ( h / 2π= h = 1.055x10 −27  erg sec).  Two limiting cases 

are worth noting. 

Non-relativistic regime:  

p = (2mo E kin )1 / 2 ,  λ= h / 2mo E kin  = h / mo v 
Eo >> Ekin, 

(1.5) 

Extreme relativsitic regime: 
p = E kin  / c , 
E kin  >> E o  , 

λ= hc / E 

(1.6) 

Eq.(1.6) applies as well to photons and neutrinos which have zero rest mass. The 
kinematical relations just discussed are general.  In practice we can safely apply the non-
relativistic expressions to neutrons, protons, and all nuclides, because their rest mass 
energies are always much greater than any kinetic energies we will encounter.  The same 
is not true for electrons, since we will be interested in electrons with energies in the Mev 
region.  Thus, the two extreme regimes do not apply to electrons, and one should use 
(1.3) for the energy-momentum relation.  Since photons have zero rest mass, they are 
always in the relativistic regime. 

 Nuclear charge 
The charge of a nuclide  z X A   is positive and equal to Ze, where e is the magnitude of the 
electron charge, e = 4.80298 x 10-10 esu (= 1.602189 x 10-19 Coulomb).  We consider 
single atoms as exactly neutral, the electron-proton charge difference is < 5 x 10-19 e, and 
the charge of a neutron is < 2 x 10-15 e. 

6 

We can look to high-energy electron scattering experiments to get an idea of how 
nuclear density and charge density are distributed across the nucleus.  Fig. 2 shows two 
typical nucleon density distributions obtained by high-energy electron scattering.  One

can see two basic components in each distribution, a core region of constant density and a 
boundary region where the density decreases smoothly to zero.  Notice the magnitude of 
the nuclear density is 1038 nucleons per cm3, compared to the atomic density of solids and 
liquids which is in the range of 1024 nuclei per cm3. What does this say about the packing 
of nucleons in a nucleus, or the average distance between nucleons versus the separation 
between nuclei?  Indeed the nucleons are packed together much more closely than the 
nuclei in a solid.  The shape of the distributions shown in Fig. 2 can be fitted to the 
expression, called the Saxon distribution,  
ρo
ρ(r ) = 
1 + exp[(r − R) / a ] 

(1.7)

 

 

 

 

 

where  ρo  = 1.65 x 1038 nucleons/cm3, R ~ 1.07 A1/3 F, and a ~ 0.55 F.  A sketch of this 
distribution, given in Fig. 3, shows clearly the core and boundary components of the

nuclear radius, and the width of the boundary region being given by 4.4a.

distribution.  Detailed studies based on high-energy electron scattering have also revealed 
that even the proton and the neutron have rather complicated structures.  This is 
illustrated in Fig. 4.  We note that mesons are unstable particles of mass between 

Fig. 4.  Charge density distributions of the proton and the neutron showing how each can 
be decomposed into a core and two meson clouds, inner (vector) and outer (scalar).  The 
core has a positive charge of ~0.35e with probable radius 0.2 F.  The vector cloud has a 
radius 0.85 F, with charge .5e and -.5e for the proton and the neutron respectively, 
whereas the scalar clouid has radius 1.4 F and charge .15e for both proton and 
neutron[adopted from Marmier and Sheldon, p. 18].  

the electron and the proton: π -mesons (pions) play an important role in nuclear forces 
( mπ  ~ 270me ), µ -mesons(muons) are important in cosmic-ray processes ( mµ  ~ 207me  ). 

Nuclear Spin and Magnetic Moment 
Nuclear angular momentum is often known as nuclear spin  h I  ; it is made up of two 
parts, the intrinsic spin of each nucleon and their orbital angular momenta.  We call I the 
spin of the nucleus, which can take on integral or half-integral values.  The following is 
usually accepted as facts.  Neutron and proton both have spin 1/2 (in unit of  h ).  Nuclei 
with even mass number A have integer or zero spin, while nuclei of odd A have half- 
integer spin.  Angular momenta are quantized. 

8 

Associated with the spin is a magnetic moment µ  , which can take on any value because
I 
it is not quantized.  The unit of magnetic moment is the magneton

(1.8)

where µB  is the Bohr magneton.  The relation between the nuclear magnetic moment and 
the nuclear spin is 

µ  = γh I 
I 

 

 

 

 

 

(1.9)

 

where γ here is the gyromagnetic ratio (no relation to the Einstein factor in special 
relativity).  Experimentally, spin and magnetic moment are measured by hyperfine 
structure (splitting of atomic lines due to interaction between atomic and nuclear 
magnetic moments), deflations in molecular beam under a magnetic field (Stern- 
Gerlach), and nuclear magnetic resonance (precession of nuclear spin in combined DC 
and microwave field).  We will say more about nmr later. 

Electric Quadruple Moment 
The electric moments of a nucleus reflect the charge distribution (or shape) of the 
nucleus.  This information is important for developing nuclear models.  We consider a 
classical calculation of the energy due to electric quadruple moment.  Suppose the 
nuclear charge has a cylindrical symmetry about an axis along the nuclear spin I, see Fig. 
5.

located along the z – axis. 

The Coulomb energy at the point S1 is 

V (r1 ,θ1 ) = ∫ d 3 r ρ(r )   
d 

 

 

 

(1.10)

where  ρ(r )  is the charge density, and  d  =  r 1  − r  .  We will expand this integral in a 
power series in 1 / r1  by noting the expansion of 1/d in a Legendre polynomial series,

The coefficients in the expansion for the energy, (1.12), are recognized to be the total 
charge, the dipole (here it is equal to zero), the quadruple, etc.  In (1.15) Q is defined to 
be the quadruole moment (in unit of 10-24 cm2, or barns).  Notice that if the charge 
distribution were spherically symmetric, <x2> = <y2> = <z2> = <r2>/3, then Q = 0.  We 
see also, Q > 0,  if  3<z2> > <r2>  and   Q <0,  if  3<z2> < <r2>.  The corresponding shape 
 
 
of the nucleus in these two cases would be prolate or oblate spheroid, respectively (see 
Fig. 6).
