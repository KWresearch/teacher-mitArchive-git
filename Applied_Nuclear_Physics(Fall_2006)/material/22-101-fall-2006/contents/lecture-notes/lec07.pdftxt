The interaction of radiation with matter is a cornerstone topic in 22.101.  Since all 
radiation interactions can be described in terms of cross sections, clearly the concept of a 
cross section and how one can go about calculating such a quantity are important 
considerations in our studies.  To keep the details, which are necessary for a deeper 
understanding, from getting in the way of an overall picture of cross section calculations, 
we attach two appendices at the end of this Lecture Note, Appendix A Concepts of Cross 
Section and Appendix B, Cross Section Calculation: Method of Phase Shifts.  The 
students regard the discussions there as part of the lecture material. 
We begin by referring to the definition of the cross section σ for a general 
interaction as discussed in Appendix A.  One sees that σ appears as the proportionality 
constant between the probability for the reaction and the number of target nuclei exposed 
per unit area, (which is why σ has the dimension of an area).  We expect that σ is a 
dynamical quantity which depends on the nature of the interaction forces between the 
radiation (which can be a particle) and the target nucleus.  Since these forces can be very 
complicated, it may then appear that any calculation of σ will be quite complicated as 
well.  It is therefore fortunate that methods for calculating σ have been developed which 
are within the grasp of students who have had a few lectures on quantum mechanics as is 
the case of students in 22.101. 
The method of phase shifts, which is the subject of Appendix B, is a well-known 
elementary method worthy of our attention..  Here we will discuss the key steps in this

method, going from the introduction of the scattering amplitude  f (θ)  to the expression 
for the angular differential cross section σ(θ) . 

Expressing σ( )θ  in terms of the Scattering Amplitude  f ( )θ 
We consider a scattering scenario sketched in Fig.7.1.

S-wave scattering 
We have seen that if kro is appreciably less than unity, then only the  l = 0 term 
contributes in (7.18) and (7.19).  The differential and total cross sections for s-wave 
scattering are therefore

Notice that s-wave scattering is spherically symmetric, or σ( )θ  is independent of the 
scattering angle.  This is true in CMCS, but not in LCS.  From (7.15) we see 
 k  .  Since the cross section must be finite at low energies, as k  → 0  fo has 
f o  = (e iδ  sin
 δ o ) /
o
to remain finite, or δ o ( )k  → 0 .  We can set

differential and total cross sections depend only on knowing the scattering length of the 
target nucleus,

any interaction (unscattered) and the other one is the wave  sin(kr +δo )  which has suffered 
a phase shift by virtue of the scattering.  The entire effect of the scattering is seen to be 
represented by the phase shiftδ o  , or equivalently the scattering length through (7.22).     
In the vicinity of the potential, we take kro to be small (this is again the condition of low-
energy scattering), so that uo ~  k r(  − a ) , in which case a becomes the distance at which 
the wave function extrapolates to zero from its value and slope at r = ro.  There are two 
ways in which this extrapolation can take place, depending on the value of kro.  As shown 
in Fig. 7.3, when kro > π/ 2  , the wave function has reached more than a quarter of its 
wavelength at r = ro.  So its slope is downward and the extrapolation gives a distance a 

7 

which is positive.  If on the other hand, kro < π / 2  , then the extrapolation gives a distance 
a which is negative.  The significance is that a > 0 means the potential is such that it can 
have a bound state, whereas a < 0 means that the potential can only give rise to a virtual 
state.

Appendix A:  Concepts of Cross Sections  


It is instructive to review the physical meaning of a cross section σ , which is a 
measure of the probability of a reaction.  Imagine a beam of neutrons incident on a thin 
sample of thickness  ∆ x  covering an area A on the sample.  See Fig. A.1.  The intensity 
 
of the beam hitting the area A is I neutrons per second.  The incident flux is therefore I/A. 

Fig. A.1.  Schematic of an incident beam striking a thin target with a particle emitted into 
a cone subtending an angle θ relative to the direction of incidence, the 'scattering' angle.  
The element of solid angle  d Ω  is a small piece of the cone (see also Fig. A.2). 

If the nuclear density of the sample is N nuclei/cm3, then the no. nuclei exposed is 
NA ∆ x  (assuming no effects of shadowing, i.e., the nuclei do not cover each other with 
respect to the incoming neutrons).  We now write down the probability for a collision-
induced reaction as 

⎛ NA∆x 
⎞ •σ   
{reaction probability} =  Θ / I  = ⎜
⎟
⎝  A  ⎠

 

 

 

(A.1)

 

where  Θ  is the no. reactions occurring per sec.  Notice that σ  simply appears in the 
definition of reaction probability as a proportionality constant, with no further 
justification.  Sometimes this simple fact is overlooked by the students.  There are other 
 
ways to introduce or motivate the meaning of the cross section; they are essentially all 

9 

 

 

equivalent when you think about the physical situation of a beam of particles colliding 
with a target of atoms.  Rewriting (A.1) we get 

σ  =  {reaction probability} / {no. exposed per unit area}

Moreover, we define  Σ = Nσ, which is called the macroscopic cross section.  Then (A.2) 
becomes

Θ

,

 

 

 

 

 

(A.3)

or 

Σ ≡  {probability per unit path for small path that a reaction will occur} 

(A.4) 

Both the microscopic cross section σ , which has the dimension of an area (unit of σ  is 
the barn which is 10-24 cm2 as already noted above) , and its counterpart, the 
macroscopic cross section  Σ , which has the dimension of reciprocal length, are 
fundamental to our study of radiation interactions.  Notice that this discussion can be 
applied to any radiation or particle, there is nothing that is specific to neutrons.  
We can readily extend the present discussion to an angular differential cross 
section  dσ/ d Ω .  Now we imagine counting the reactions per second in an angular cone 
subtended at angle θ  with respect to the direction of incidence (incoming particles), as 
shown in Fig. A.1.  Let  dΩ  be the element of solid angle, which is the small area through 
which the unit vector  Ω  passes through (see Fig. A.2).  Thus,  dΩ = sinθd dθ ϕ.

 is called the angular differential cross

Notice that again  dσ/ d Ω  appears as a proportionality constant between the reaction rate 
per unit solid angle and a product of two simple factors specifying the interacting system 
- the incient flux and the number of nuclei exposed (or the number of nuclei available for 
reaction).  The normalization condition of the angular differential cross section is 
∫d

section. 
There is another differential cross section which we can introduce.  Suppose we 
consider the incoming particles to have energy E and the particles after reaction to have 
energy in dE' about E'.  One can define in a similar way as above an energy differential 
cross section,  dσ/ dE
 
' , which is a measure of the probability of an incoming particle 
with energy E will have as a result of the reaction outgoing energy E'.  Both  dσ/ d Ω and 
dσ/ dE '  are distribution functions, the former is a distribution in the variable  Ω , the 
solid angle, whereas the latter is a distribution in E', the energy after scattering.  Their 
dimensions are barns per steradian and barns per unit energy, respectively.   
Combining the two extensions above from cross section to differential cross 
sections, we can further extend to a double differential cross section  d 2σ/ d ΩdE
 
' , which 
is a quantity that has been studied extensively in thermal neutron scattering.  This cross 
section contains the most fundamental information about the structure and dynamics of 
 
the scattering sample. While  d 2σ/ d ΩdE
'  is a distribution in two variables, the solid 
angle and the energy after scattering, it is not a distribution in E, the energy before 
scattering. 

11 

In 22.106 we will be concerned with all three types of cross sections, σ , the two 
differential cross sections., and the double differential cross section for neutrons, whereas  
the double differential cross section is beyond the scope of 22.101. 
There are many important applications which are based on neutron interactions 
with nuclei in various media.  We are interested in both the cross sections and the use of 
these cross sections in various ways.  In diffraction and spectroscopy we use neutrons to 
probe the structure and dynamics of the samples being measured.  In cancer therapy we 
use neutrons to preferentially kill the cancerous cells.  Both involve a single collision 
event between the neutron and a nucleus, for which a knowledge of the cross section is 
all that required so long as the neutron is concerned.  In contrast, for reactor and other 
nuclear applications one is interested in the effects of a sequence of collisions or multiple 
collisions, in which case knowing only the cross section is not sufficient.  One needs to 
follow the neutrons as they undergo many collisions in the media of interest.  This then 
requires the study of neutron transport - the distribution of neutrons in configuration 
space, direction of travel, and energy.  In 22.106 we will treat transport in two ways, 
theoretical discussion and direct simulation using the Monte Carlo method, and the 
general purpose code MCNP (Monte Carlo Neutron and Photon).

_______________________________________________________________________ 
We will study a method of analyzing potential scattering; it is called the method 
of partial waves or the method of phase shifts.  This is the quantum mechanical 
description of the two-body collision process.  In the center-of-mass coordinate system 
the problem is to describe the motion of an effective particle with mass µ , the reduced 
mass, moving in a central potential V(r), where r is the separation distance between the 
two colliding particles.  We will solve the Schrödinger wave equation for the spatial 
distribution of this effective particle, and extract from this solution the information 
needed to determine the angular differential cross section σ ( )θ  .  For a discussion of the 
concepts of cross sections, see Appendix A. 

The Scattering Amplitude  f ( )θ 
In treating the potential scattering problem quantum mechanically the standard 
approach is to do it in two steps, first to define the cross section σ ( )θ  in terms of the 
scattering amplitude  f ( )θ  , and then to calculate  f ( )θ  by solving the Schrödinger equation. 
For the first step we visualize the scattering process as an incoming beam impinging on a 
potential field V(r) centered at the origin (CMCS), as shown in Fig. B.1. The incident 
beam is represented by a traveling plane wave, 

Ψ = be i ( k ⋅r −ωt ) 
in

where b is a coefficient determined by the normalization condition, and the wave vector 
k zˆ  is directed along the z-axis (direction of incidence).  The magnitude of k is set by

Once we have expressions for the incident and scattered waves, the corresponding 
current (or flux) can be obtained from the relation (see (2.24))

This is the fundamental expression relating the scattering amplitude to the cross section; 
it has an analogue in the analysis of potential scattering in classical mechanics.  

Method of Partial Waves 
To calculate  f ( )θ  from the Schrödinger wave equation we note that since this is 
 
not a time-dependent problem, we can look for a separable solution in space and

For two-body scattering through a central potential, this is the wave equation for an 
2 /(m1  + m2 ) , and energy E 
effective particle with mass equal to the reduced mass,  µ= m m1 
equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of the two particles in CMCS, or equivalently 

15 

E  = µv 2  / 2 , with  v  being the relative speed.  The reduction of the two-body problem to 
the effective one-body problem (B.6) is a useful exercise, which is quite standard.  For 
those in need of a review, a discussion of the reduction in classical as well as quantum 
mechanics is given at the end of this Appendix. 
As is well known, there are two kinds of solutions to (B.6), bound-state solutions 
for E < 0 and scattering solutions for E > 0.  We are concerned with the latter situation. 
In view of (B.2) and Fig. B.1, it is conventional to look for a particular solution to (B.6), 
subject to the boundary condition

where  ro   is the range of force, V(r) = 0 for r > ro.  The subscript k is a reminder that the 
entire analysis is carried out at constant k, or at fixed incoming energy  E  =  h  k  / 2µ .  It 
2
2
also means that  f ( )θ  depends on E, although this is commonly not indicated explicitly.  
For simplicity of notation, we will suppress this subscript henceforth.  
According to (B.7) at distances far away from the region of the scattering 
potential, the wave function is a superposition of an incident plane wave and a spherical 
outgoing scattered wave.  In the far-away region, the wave equation is therefore that of a 
free particle since V(r) = 0.   This free-particle solution is what we want to match up with 
(B.7).  The form of the solution that is most convenient for this purpose is the expansion 
of ψ( )r   into a set of partial waves.  Since we are considering central potentials, 
interactions which are spherically symmetric, or V depends only on the separation 
distance (magnitude of  r ) of the two colliding particles, the natural coordinate system in 

which to find the solution is spherical coordinates,  r → ( ,
r θϕ  .  The azimuthal angle ϕ is

This result is called the radial wave equation for rather obvious reasons; it is a one-
dimensional equation whose solution determines the scattering process in three 
dimensions, made possible by the properties of the central potential V(r).  Unless V(r) has 
a special form that admits analytic solutions, it is often more effective to integrate (B.10) 
numerically.  However, we will not be concerned with such calculations since our interest 
is not to solve the most general scattering problem. 
Eq.(B.10) describes the wave function in the interaction region, r < ro, where V(r) 
= 0, r > ro.  The solution to this equation clearly depends on the form of V(r).  On the 
other hand, outside of the interaction region, r > ro, Eq.(B.10) reduces to the radial wave 
equation for a free particle.  Since this equation is universal in that it applies to all 
scattering problems where the interaction potential has a finite range ro, it is worthwhile 

17 

to discuss a particular form of its solution.  Writing Eq.(B.10) for the exterior region this

(B.14)

 

The second step in (B.14) deserves special attention.  Notice that we have replaced the 
two integration constant B and C by two other constants, a and δ , the latter being 
introduced as a phase shift.  The significance of the phase shift will be apparent as we 
proceed further in discussing how one can calculate the angular differential cross section 
through (B.5).  In Fig. B.2 below we give a simple physical explanation of how the sign 
of the phase shift depends on whether the interaction is attractive (positive phase shift) or 
repulsive (negative phase shift). 
Combining (B.14) with (B.8) we have the partial-wave expansion of the wave 
function in the asymptotic region,

(B.15) 

This is the left-hand side of (B.7).  Our intent is to match this description of the wave 
function with the right-hand side of (B.7), also expanded in partial waves, thus relating 
the scattering amplitude to the phase shift.  Both terms on the right-hand side of (B.7) are 
seen to depend on the scattering angleθ .  Even though the scattering amplitude is still 
unknown, we nevertheless can go ahead and expand it in terms of partial waves, 

f  θ  = ∑  l

where the coefficients  f

(B.17) 

Inserting both (B.16) and (B.17) into the right-hand side of (B.7), we see that terms on 
both sides are proportional to either exp(ikr) or exp(-ikr).  If (B.7) is to hold in general, 
the coefficients of each exponential have to be equal.  This gives

Eq.(B.18) is the desired relation between the  l -th component of the scattering amplitude 
and the  l -th order phase shift.  Combining it with (B.16), we have the scattering 
amplitude expressed as a sum of partial-wave components

This expression, more than any other, shows why the present method of calculating the 
cross section is called the method of partial waves.  Now the angular differential cross

(B.22)

 

Eqs.(B.21) and (B.22) are very well known results in the quantum theory of potential 
scattering.  They are quite general in that there are no restrictions on the incident energy.  
Since we are mostly interested in calculating neutron cross sections in the low-energy 
regime (kro << 1), it is only necessary to take the leading term in the partial-wave sum. 
The  l = 0 term in the partial-wave expansion is called the s-wave.  One can make 
a simple semiclassical argument to show that at a given incident energy  E  = h
2 k 2  / 2µ, only 
those partial waves with  l  < kro make significant contributions to the scattering.  If it 
happens that furthermore kro << 1, then only the  l  = 0 term matters.  In this argument 
one considers an incoming particle incident on a potential at an impact parameter b.  The 
angular momentum in this interaction is  hl  = pb, where  p = hk   is the linear momentum 
of the particle.  Now one argues that there is appreciable interaction only when b <  ro, the 
range of interaction; in other words, only the  l  values satisfying b =  l /k < ro will have 
significant contriubution to the scattering.  The condition for a partial wave to contribute 
is therefore  l  < kro 

S-wave scattering 
We have seen that if kro is appreciably less than unity, then only the  l  = 0 term 
contributes in (B.21) and (B.22).  What does this mean for neutron scattering at energies 
around kBT ~ 0.025 eV?  Suppose we take a typical value for ro at ~ 2 x 10 -12 cm, then 
we find that for thermal neutrons kro ~ 10-5.  So one is safely under the condition of low-
energy scattering, kro << 1, in which case only the s-wave contribution to the cross 
section needs to be considered.  The differential and total scattering cross sections 
become

(B.24)

 

It is important to notice that s-wave scattering is spherically symmetric in that σ( )θ  is 
manifestly independent of the scattering angle (this comes from the property Po(x) = 1). 
One should also keep in mind that while this is so in CMCS, it is not true in LCS.  In both 
(B.23) and (B.24) we have indicated that s-wave phase shift δo   depends on the incoming 
energy E.  From (B.18) we see that  f o  = (e iδ  sin
 k  .  Since the cross section must be 
 δ o ) /
o
finite at low energies, as k  → 0  fo has to remain finite, or δ o ( )k  → 0 .  Thus we can set 

lim k→0 [e iδo (

)k  sin δo (  )] = δo k
k 
( ) = −ak

 

 

 

 

(B.25)

where the constant a is called the scattering length.  Thus for low-energy scattering, the 
differential and total cross sections depend only on knowing the scattering length of the 
target nucleus, 

( )  = a 2
σθ 

σ = 4πa 2 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B.26)

(B.27)

We will see in the next lecture on neutron-proton scattering that the large scattering cross 
section of hydrogen arises because the scattering length depends on the relative 
orientation of the neturon and proton spins. 

Reduction of two-body collision to an effective one-body problem  
We conclude this Appendix with a supplemental discussion on how the problem 
of two-body collision through a central force is reduced, in both classical and quantum 
mechanics, to the problem of scattering of an effective one particle by a potential field 
V(r) [Meyerhof, pp. 21].  By central force we mean the interaction potential is only a 
function of the separation distance between the colliding particles.  We will first go 

 

 

 

22 

through the argument in classical mechanics.  The equation describing the motion of 
particle 1 moving under the influence of particle 2 is the Newton's equation of motion, 

m r && = F	
1	
1

12 

(B.28)

where  r 1  is the position of particle 1 and  F 12  is the force on particle 1 exerted by particle 
2.  	 Similarly, the motion of motion for particle 2 is 

m r && = F  = − F 
2
21 
12 
2

(B.29)

where we have noted that the force exerted on particle 2 by particle 1 is exactly the 
opposite of  F 12  .  Now we transform from laboratory coordinate system to the center-of-
mass coordinate system by defining the center-of-mass and relative positions, 

r c  =

(B.32) 

(B.33) 

with  µ = m m   /(m  + m ) being the reduced mass.  Thus the center-of-mass moves in a 
1

1 
2 
straight-line trajectory like a free particle, while the relative position satisfies the equation 

23 

of an effective particle with mass  µ moving under the force generated by the potential 
V(r).  Eq.(B.33) is the desired result of our reduction.  It is manifestly the one-body 
problem of an effective particle scattered by a potential field.  Far from the interaction 
field the particle has the kinetic energy E 
= µ r&  2
( )  / 2  
The quantum mechanical analogue of this reduction proceeds from the 
Schrödinger equation for the system of two particles,

Since the Hamiltonian is now a sum of two parts, each involving either the center-of-
mass position or the relative position, the problem is separable.  Anticipating this, we 
have also divided the total energy, previously the sum of the kinetic energies of the two 
particles, into a sum of center-of-mass and relative energies.  Therefore we can write the 
 so that (B.35) reduces to two separate
