We will use the expressions relating energy and scattering angles derived in the 
previous chapter to determine the energy and angular distributions of an elastically 
scattered neutron.  The energy distribution, in particular, is widely used in the analysis of 
neutron energy moderation in systems where neutrons are produced at high energies 
(Mev) by nuclear reactions and slow down to thermal energies.  This is the problem of 
neutron slowing down, where the assumption of the target nucleus being initially at rest is 
justified.  When the neutron energy approaches the thermal region (~ 0.025 ev), the 
  
stationary target assumption is no longer valid.   One can relax this assumption and 
derive a more general distribution which holds for neutron elastic scattering at any 
energy.  This then is the result that should be used for the analysis of the spectrum 
(energy distribution) of thermal neutrons, a problem known as neutron thermalization.  
As part of this discussion we will have an opportunity to study the energy dependence of 
the elastic scattering cross section. 
We have seen from our study of cross section calculation using the method of 
phase shift that for low-energy scattering (kro << 1, which is equivalent to neutron 
energies below about 10-100 kev) only s-wave contribution to the cross section is 
important, and moreover, the angular distribution of the scattered neutron is spherically 
symmetric in CMCS.  This is the result that we will make use of in deriving the energy 
distribution of the elastically scattered neutron.

Energy Distribution of Elastically Scattered Neutrons 
We define  P (Ω c )  as the probability that the scattered neutron will be going in the 
 
direction of the unit vector  Ω c   (recall this is a unit vector in angular space).  We should 
also understand that a more physical way of defining P is to say that 

P(Ω c )dΩ c  = 	 the probability that the neutron will be scattered into an element of
 solid angle  dΩ c  about  Ω c 

For s-wave scattering one has therefore 

P (Ω c )dΩ c  = 

dΩ
c	
4π 

(16.1)

Notice that  P(Ω c )  is a probability distribution in the two angular variables, ϕc  and θc , 
and is properly normalized,

Since there is a one-to-one relation between θ and E3 (cf. (15.13)), we can transform
c 
(16.1) to obtain a probability distribution in the outgoing energy, E3.  To do this we first 
need to reduce (16.1) from a distribution in two variables to a distribution in the variable 
θc .  Let us define  G (θc ) as the probability of the scattering angle being θc .  This quantity 
can be obtained from (16.1) by simply integrating (16.1) over all values of the azimuthal 
angle ϕc ,

Now we can write down the transformation from G( θc ) to the energy distribution in the 
outgoing energy.  For the purpose of general discussion our notation system of labeling 
particles as 1 through 4 is not a good choice.  It is more conventional to label the energy 
of the neutron before and after the collision as either E and E’, or vice versa.  We will 
therefore switch notation at this point and let E1 = E and E3 = E’, and denote the 
probability distribution for E’ as  F (E → E ' ) .  The transformation between G( θc ) and 
F (E → E ' ) is the same as that for any distribution function, 

F (E → E ' )dE ' = G (θc )dθc 

With G( θc ) given by (16.4) we obtain 

F (E → E ' ) = G (θc )

The Jacobian of transformation can be readily evaluated from (15.13) after relabeling E1 
and E3 as E and E’.  Thus, 

F (E → E ' ) =

The distribution, which is sketched in Fig. 16.1, is so simple that one can understand 
completely all its features.  The distribution is uniform in the interval (α E, E) because 
the scattering is spherically symmetric (independence of scattering angle translates into 
independence of outgoing energy because of the one-to-one correspondence).  The fact 
that the outgoing energy can only lie in a particular interval follows from the range of 
scattering angle (0, π ).  Since α depends on the mass of the target, being zero for 
hydrogen and approaching unity as M >> m, the interval can vary from (0, E) for 
hydrogen to a vanishing value as A >> 1.  In other words, the neutron can lose all its 
energy in one collision with hydrogen, and loses practically no energy if it collides with a

energy E will have an energy in dE’ about E’. 

very heavy target nucleus.  Although simple, the distribution is quite useful for the 
analysis of neutron energy moderation in the slowing down regime.  It also represents a 
reference behavior for discussing conditions when it is no longer valid to assume the 
scattering is spherically symmetric in CMCS, or to assume the target nucleus is at rest.  
We will come back to these two situations later. 
Notice that F is a distribution, so its dimension is the reciprocal of its argument, 
an energy.  F is also properly normalized, its integral over the range of the outgoing 
energy is necessarily unity as required by particle conservation.  Knowing the probability 
distribution F one can construct the energy differential cross section 

such that

(16.7)

(16.8) 

which is the ‘total’ (in the sense that it is the integral of a differential) scattering cross 
section.  It is important to keep in mind that σs  (E )  is a function of the initial (incoming) 

4 

neutron energy, whereas the integration in (16.8) is over the final (outgoing) neutron 
energy.  The quantity  F (E → E ' )  is a distribution in the variable E’ and also a function 
of E.  We can multiply (16.7) by the number density of the target nuclei N to obtain 

Nσs (E )F (E → E ' ) ≡ Σ s (E → E ' ) 

(16.9) 

which is sometimes known as the scattering kernel.  As its name suggests, this is the 
quantity that appears in the neutron balance equation for neutron slowing down in an 
absorbing medium, 

E / α 
[Σ s (E ) + Σ a (E )]φ(E ) = ∫ dE ' Σ s ( E ' → E )φ(E ' ) 
E 

(16.10) 

where φ(E ) = vn( E )  is the neutron flux and n(E) is the neutron number density.  
Eq.(16.10) is an example of the usefulness of the energy differential scattering cross 
section (16.7). 
The scattering distribution  F (E → E ' )  can be used to calculate various energy-
averaged quantities pertaining to elastic scattering.  For example, the average loss for a 
collision at energy E is 

E 
∫ dE ' (E − E ' )F (E → E ' ) = 
αE 

E

(1 −α) 

(16.11)

For hydrogen the energy loss in a collision is one-half its energy before the collision, 
whereas for a heavy nucleus it is ~ 2E/A. 

Angular Distribution of Elastically Scattered Neutrons 
We have already made use of the fact that for s-wave scattering the angular 
distribution is spherically symmetric in CMCS.  This means that the angular differential 
scattering cross section in CMCS if of the form

(16.12)

One can ask what is the angular differential scattering cross section in LCS?  The answer 
can be obtained by transforming the results (16.12) from a distribution in the unit vector 
Ω c to a distribution in  Ω .  As before (cf. (16.5)) we write 

or 

σs (θ )dΩ =σ s (θc )dΩ c 

sinθ  dθ 
c
c 
σ s (θ ) =σ s (θc ) 
sinθ  dθ 

(16.13) 

(16.14)

From the relation between  cosθ and  cosθ , (15.15), we can calculate 
c 

d (cosθ )  = 
d (cosθc ) 

sinθc dθc 
sinθdθ 

Thus 

σ s (θ ) =

σ s (E )  (γ 2  + 2γ cosθc  + 1)3 / 2 
1 + γ cosθc 
4π 

 

(16.15)

with γ = 1/A.  Since (16.15) is a function of θ , the factor  cosθc  on the right hand side 
should be expressed in terms of  cosθ in accordance with (15.15).  The angular 
distribution in LCS, as given by (16.15), is somewhat too complicated to sketch simply.  
From the relation between LCS and CMCS indicated in Fig. 15.2, we can expect that if 
the distribution is isotropic in LCS, then the distribution in CMCS should be peaked in 
the forward direction (simply because the scattering angle in LCS is always less than the 
angle in CMCS).  One way to demonstrate that this is indeed the case is to calculate the 
average value of µ= cosθ ,

(16.16)

The fact that µ > 0 means that the angular distribution is peaked in the forward direction.  
This bias becomes less pronounced the heavier the target mass; for A >> 1 the distinction 
between LCS and CMCS vanishes. 

Assumptions in Deriving  F (E → E ' ) 
In arriving at the scattering distribution (also sometimes called the scattering 
frequency), (16.7), we have made use of three assumptions, namely, 
elastic scattering 
(i) 
target nucleus at rest 
(ii) 
scattering is isotropic in CMCS (s-wave) 
(iii) 
These assumptions imply certain restrictions pertaining to the energy of incoming 
neutron E and the temperature of the scattering medium.  Assumption (i) is valid 
provided the neutron energy is not high enough to excite the nuclear levels of the 
compound nucleus formed by the target nucleus plus the incoming neutron.  On the other 
hand, if the neutron energy is high enough  to excite the first nuclear energy level above 
the ground state, then inelastic scattering becomes energetically possible,   Inelastic 
 
scattering is a threshold reaction (Q < 0), it can occur in heavy nuclei at E ~ 0.05 – 0.1 
Mev, or in medium nuclei at ~ 0.1 – 0.2 Mev.  Typically the cross section for inelastic 
scattering, σ (n, n' ) , is of the order of 1 barn or less.  In comparison with elastic 
scattering, which is always present no matter what other reactions can take place and is of 
order 5 – 10 barns except in the case of hydrogen where it is 20 barns as we have 
previously discussed. 
Assumption (ii) is valid when the neutron energy is large compared to the kinetic 
energy of the target nucleus, typically taken to be kBT assuming the medium is in 
equilibrium at temperature T.  This would be the case for neutron energies ~ 0.1 ev and 
above.  When the incident neutron energy is comparable to the energy of the target 

7 

nucleus, the assumption of stationary target is clearly invalid.  To take into account the 
thermal motions of the target, one should know what is the state of the target since the 
nuclear (atomic) motions in solids are different from those in liquids, vibrations in the 
former and diffusion in the latter.   If we assume the scattering medium can be treated as 
 
a gas at temperature T, then the target nucleus moves in a straight line with a speed that is 
given by the Maxwellian distribution.  In this case one can derive the scattering 
distribution which is an extension of (16.7) [see, for example, G. I. Bell and S. Glasstone, 
Nuclear Reactor Theory (Van Nostrand reinhold, New York 1970), p. 336].  We do not 
go into the details here except to show the qualitative behavior in Fig. 16.2.  From the 
way the scattering distribution changes with incoming energy E one can get a good 
intuitive feeling for how the more general  F (E → E ' )  evolves from a spread-out 
distribution (the curves for E = kBT) to the more restricted form given by (16.7).

mass A = M/m at temperature T.  (from Bell and Glasstone) 

Notice that for E ~ kBT there can be appreciable upscattering which is not possible when 
assumption (ii) is invoked.  As E becomes larger compared to kBT, upscattering becomes 
less important.  The condition of stationary nucleus also means that E >> kBT. 
When thermal motions have to be taken into account, the scattering cross section 
σs (E )  is also changed; it is no longer a constant,  4πa 2 , where  a  is the scattering length.  
This occurs in the energy region of neutron thermalization; it covers the range (0, 0.1 - 

8 

0.5 ev).  We will now discuss the energy dependence of σ s (E ) .  For the case of the 
scattering medium being a gas of atoms with mass A and at temperature T, it is still 
relatively straightforward to work out the expression forσ s (E ) .  We will give the 
essential steps to give the student some feeling for the kind of analysis that one can carry 
out even for more complicated situations such as neutron elastically in solids and liquids. 

Energy Dependence of Scattering Cross Section σ s (E ) 
When the target nucleus is not at rest, one can write down the expression for the 
elastic scattering cross section measured in the laboratory (we will call it the measured 
cross section), 

vσ (v) = ∫ d 3V v − V σ theo ( v − V  )P(V ,T ) 
meas 

(16.17)

where  v  is the neutron speed in LCS, V  is the target nucleus velocity in LCS, σ theo  is the 
scattering cross section we calculate theoretically, such as what we had previously 
studied using the phase-shift method and solving the wave equation for an effective one-
body problem (notice that the result is a function of the relative speed between neutron 
and target nucleus), and P is the thermal distribution of the target nucleus velocity which 
depends on the temperature of the medium.  Eq.(16.17) is a general relation between 
what is calculated theoretically, in solving the effective one-body problem, and what is 
measured in the laboratory where one necessarily has only an average over all possible 
target nucleus velocities.  What we call the scattering cross section σs (E )  we mean 
σ meas  .  It turns out that we can reduce (16.17) further by using for P the Maxwellian 
distribution and obtain the result 

σ s (v) =

(16.22) 

The physical significance of this calculation is that one sees the elastic scattering cross 
section has a 1/v behavior at low energy (or high temperature) and a constant behavior at 
high energy.  The expression (16.18) is therefore a useful expression giving the energy 
variation of the scattering cross section over the entire energy range from thermal to Mev, 
so far as elastic scattering is concerned.  Note that this result has been obtained by 
assuming the target nuclei move as in a gas of noninteracting atoms.  This assumption is 
not realistic when the scattering medium is a solid or a liquid.  For these situations one 
can also work out the expressions for the cross section, but the results are more 
complicated (and beyond the scope of this course).  We will therefore settle for a brief, 
qualitative look at what new features can be seen in the energy dependence of the elastic 
scattering cross sections of typical solids (crystals) and liquids. 

10 

Fig. 16.3 shows the total and elastic scattering cross sections of graphite (C12) 
over the entire energy range of interest to this class.  At the very low-energy end we see a 
number of features we have not discussed previously.  These all have to do with the fact 
that the target nucleus (atom) is bound to a crystal lattice and therefore the positions of 
the nuclei are fixed to well-defined lattice sites and the atomic motions are small-
amplitude vibrations about these sites.  There is a sharp drop of the cross section below 
an energy marked Bragg cutoff.  Cutoff here refers to Bragg reflection which occurs 
when the condition for constructive interference (reflection) is satisfied, a condition that 
depends on the wavelength of the neutron (hence its energy) and the spacing between the 
lattice planes in the crystal.  When the wavelength is too long (energies below the cutoff) 
for the Bragg condition to be satisfied, the cross section drops sharply.  What is then left 
is the interaction between the neutron and the vibrational motions of the nuclei, this 
process involves the transfer of energy from the vibrations to the neutron which has much 
lower energy.  Since there is more excitation of the vibrational modes at higher 
temperatures, this is reason why the cross section below the Bragg cutoff is very sensitive 
to temperature, increasing with increasing T. 
Above the Bragg cutoff the cross section shows some oscillations.  These 
correspond to the onset of additional reflections by planes which have smaller lattice 
spacings.  At energies around kBT the cross section approaches a constant value up to ~ 
0.3 Mev.  This is the region where our previous calculation of cross section would apply.  
Between 0.3 and 1 Mev the scattering cross section decreases gradually, a behavior 
which we can still understand using simple theory (beyond what we had discussed).  
Above 1 Mev one sees scattering resonances, which we have not yet discussed; also there 
is now a difference between total and scattering cross sections (which should be 
attributed to absorption).

Fig. 16.4 shows the measured total cross section of H2O in the form of water.  The 
cross section is the sum of contributions from two hydrogen and an oxygen.  Compared 
to Fig. 16.3 the low-energy behavior here is quite different.  This is not unexpected since 
a crystal and a liquid are really very different with regard to their atomic structure and 
atomic motions.  In the case of the liquid the cross section rises from a constant value at 
energies above 1 ev in a manner like the 1/v behavior given by (16.21).  Notice that the 
constant value of about 45 barns is just what we know from the hydrogen cross section 
σso  of 20 barns per hydrogen and a cross section of about 5 barns for oxygen.

The importance of hydrogen (water) in neutron scattering has led to another interpretation 
of the rise of the cross section with decreasing neutron energy, one which focuses on the 
effect of chemical binding.  The idea is that at high energies (relative to thermal) the 
neutron does not see the water molecule.  Instead it sees only the individual nuclei as 
targets which are free-standing and essentially at rest.  In this energy range (1 ev and 
above) the interaction is the same as that between a neutron and free protons and oxygen 
nuclei.  This is why the cross section is just the sum of the individual contributions.  
When the cross section starts to rise as the energy decreases, this is an indication that the 
chemical binding of the protons and oxygen in a water molecule starts to have an effect. 
When the neutron energy is at kBT the neutron now sees the entire water molecule rather 
than the individual nuclei.   In that case the scattering is effectively between a neutron 
 
and a water molecule.  What this means is that as the neutron energy decreases the target 
changes from individual nuclei with their individual mass to a water molecule with mass 
18.  Now one can show the scattering cross section is actually proportional to the square 
of the reduced mass of the scatterer µ ,

One can define a free-atom cross section appropriate for the energy range where the cross 
section is a constant, and a bound-atom cross section for the energy range where the cross 
section is rising, with the relation 

⎛  A  ⎞ 2 
σfree  =σ bound ⎜

⎝ A + 1 ⎠ 

(16.24)

For hydrogen these two cross sections would have the values of 20 barns and 80 barns 
respectively. 
We close this chapter with a brief consideration of assumption (iii) used in 
deriving (16.7).  When the neutron energy is in the 10 Kev range and higher, the 
contributions from the higher angular momentum (p-wave and above) scattering may 
become significant.  In that case we know the angular distribution will be more forward 
peaked.  This means one should replace (16.1) by a different form of P(Ω c ) .  Without 
going through any more details, we show in Fig. 16.5 the general behavior that one can 
expect in the scattering distribution F when scattering in CMCS is no longer isotropic.
