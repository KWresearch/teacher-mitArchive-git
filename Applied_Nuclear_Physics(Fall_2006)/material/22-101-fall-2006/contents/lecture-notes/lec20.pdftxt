Photoelectric Effect 
This is the predominant mode of γ - interaction in all kinds of matter, especially 
the high-Z absorbers, at energies less than ~ 0.1 Mev.  The process, sketched in Fig. 18. 
1, is the interaction between the gamma and the entire atom (the electron cloud) that 
results in the absorption of the gamma and the ejection of an electron with kinetic energy 

T  ~ hω− Be

 

(18.1) 

where  Be  is the electron binding energy.  The recoiling atom is left in an excited state at 
an excitation energy of  Be ; it can then de-excite by emitting x-rays or Auger electrons.

ejection of an atomic electron and excitation of the recoiling atom.

  Notice this is atomic and not nuclear excitation.  One can show that the incident γ 
cannot be totally absorbed by a free electron because momentum and energy 
conservations cannot be satisfied simultaneously, but total absorption can occur if the 
electron is initially bound in an atom.  The most tightly bound electrons have the greatest 
probability of absorbing theγ .  It is known theoretically and experimentally that ~ 80% 
of the absorption occurs in the K (innermost) shell, so long as  hω> Be (K − shell ) . 
Typical ionization potentials of K electrons are 2.3 kev ( Al ), 10 kev (Cu), and ~ 100 kev 
(Pb). 
 

The conservations equations for photoelectric effect are 

h k  =  p +  p	

a 

hω= T  + Ta  + Be	

(18.2)

(18.3) 

where  p  is the momentum of the recoiling atom whose kinetic energy is  Ta .  Since  Ta  ~ 
a 
T (me  / M ) , where M is the mass of the atom, one can usually ignore  Ta . 
The theory describing the photoelectric effect is essentially a first-order 
perturbation theory calculation (cf. Heitler, Sec. 21).  In this case the transition taking 
place is between an initial state consisting of two particles, a bound electron, wave 
2 / me e 2 = 0.529 x 10-8 
function ~  e − r / a  , with  a = a o  / Z  ,  a o  being the Bohr radius (=  h
cm), and an incident photon, wave function  e i k ⋅r  , and a final state consisting of a free 
electron whose wave function is  e i p⋅r / h  .  The interaction potential is of the form  A ⋅ p , 
where A is the vector potential of the electromagnetic radiation and  p  is the electron 

momentum.  The result of this calculation is

where v is the photoelectron speed.  The polar and azimuthal angles specifying the 
direction of the photoelectron are defined in Fig. 18.2.  One should pay particular notice 
to the Z5 and  (hω) −7 / 2  variation.  As for the angular dependence, the numerator in  

Fig. 18.2.  Spherical coordinates defining the photoelectron direction of emission relative 
to the incoming photon wave vector and its polarization vector. 

(18.4) suggests an origin in ( p ⋅ε ) 2  , while the denominator suggests  p ⋅ k  .  Integration of

where one has ignored the angular dependence in the denominator and has multiplied the 
result by a factor of 2 to account for 2 electrons in the K-shell [Heitler, p. 207]. 

In practice it has been found that the charge and energy dependence behave more like 

στ  ∝ Z n /(hω) 3 

(18.6) 

with n varying from 4 to 4.6 as  hω varies from ~ 0.1 to 3 Mev, and with the energy 
exponent decreasing from 3 to 1 when  hω≥ me c 2 .  The qualitative behavior of the 
photoelectric cross section is illustrated in the figures below.

Edge Absorption 
As the photon energy increases the cross section σκ can show discontinuous 
jumps which are known as edges.  These correspond to the onset of additional 
contributions when the energy is sufficient to eject an inner shell electron. The effect is 
more pronounced in the high-Z material.  See Fig. 18.13 below. 

Pair Production 
In this process, which can occur only when the energy of the incident γ exceeds 1.02 
Mev, the photon is absorbed in the vicinity of the nucleus, a positron-electron pair is 
produced, and the atom is left in an excited state, as indicated in Fig. 18.6.  The

One can show that these conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously, the presence of an 
atomic nucleus is required.  Since the nucleus takes up some momentum, it also takes up 
some energy in the form of recoil. 
The existence of positron is a consequence of the Dirac’s relativistic theory of the 
electron which allows for negative energy states, 

E  = ± (c p  + m c  )

(18.9)

One assumes that all the negative states are filled; these represent a “sea” of 
electrons which are generally not observable because no transitions into these states can 
occur due to the Exclusion Principle.  When one of the electrons makes a transition to a 
positive energy level, it leaves a “hole” (positron) which behaves likes an electron but 
with a positive charge.  This is illustrated in Fig. 18.7.  In other words, holes in the

negative energy states have positive charge, whereas an electrons in the positive energy 
states have negative charge.  The “hole” is unstable in that it will recombine with an 
electron when it loses most of its kinetic energy (thermalized).  This recombination 
process is called pair annihilation.  It usually produces two γ (annihilation radiation), 
each of energy 0.511 Mev, emitted back-to-back.  A positron and an electron can form an 
atom called the positronium.  It’s life time is ~ 10-7 to 10-9 sec depending on the relative 
spin orientation, the shorter lifetime corresponding to antiparallel orientation.  
Pair production is intimately related to the process of Bremsstrahlung in which an 
electron undergoes a transition from one positive energy state to another while a photon 
is emitted.  One can take over directly the theory of Bremsstrahlung for the transition 
probability with the incident particle being a photon instead of an electron and using the 
appropriate density of states for the emission of the positron-electron pair [Heitler, Sec. 
26].  For the positron the energy differential cross section is

2  / 137  = 5.8 x 10-4 barns.  This result holds under the conditions of Born 
where σo  = re 
approximation, which is a high-energy condition ( Ze 2 / hv ±  << 1 ), and no screening, 
which requires  2T+T−  / hωme c 2  << 137 / Z 1 / 3 .  Here screening means the partial reduction 
of the nuclear charge by the potential of the inner-shell electrons.  As a result of the Born 
approximation, the cross section is symmetric in T+ and T-.  Screening effects will lead to 
a lower cross section.

energy of the incident photon.  Since the value is slightly higher for Al than for Pb, it 
means the cross section varies with Z somewhat weaker than Z2.  At lower energies the 
cross section favors equal distribution of energy between the positron and the electron, 
while at high energies a slight tendency toward unequal distribution could be noted.  
Intuitively we expect the energy distribution to be biased toward more energy for the 
positron than for the electron simply because of Coulomb repulsion of the positron and 
attraction of the electron by the nucleus.  
The total cross section for pair production is obtained by integrating (18.11).  
Analytical integration is possible only for extremely relativistic cases [Evans, p. 705],

hω >> 137me c 2 Z −1 / 2  respectively.  The behavior of this cross section is shown in Fig. 
18.9, along with the cross section for Compton scattering.  Notice that screening leads to 
a saturation effect (energy independence); however, it is not significant below  hω ~ 10 
Mev

Mass Attenuation Coefficients 
So long as the different processes of photon interaction are not correlated, the 
total linear attenuation coefficient µ for γ -interaction can be taken as the sum of 
contributions from Compton scattering, photoelectric effect, and pair production, with 
µ= Nσ  and N being the number of atoms per cm3.  Since  N  = N o ρ / A , where No is 
Avogardro’s number and  ρ the mass density of the absorber, it is again useful to express 
the interaction in terms of the mass attenuation coefficient µ / ρ .  As we had discussed in 
Lecture 14, this quantity is essentially independent of the density and physical state of the 
absorber.  Recall our observation in the case of charged particle interactions that Z/A is 
approximately constant for all elements.  Here we see that in the product  Nσ we get a 
factor of 1/A from N, and we can get a factor of Z from any of the three cross sections σ , 
so we can also take advantage of Z/A being roughly constant in describing photon

interaction (the same argument does not hold for neutrons even though it is useful to 
think of neutron interactions in terms of the macroscopic cross section  Σ ).  We write 
  

µ= µC + µτ  + µκ   

 

 

 

 

 

(18.14)

 

µC  / ρ = (N o  / A)Zσ C  ,  σ C ~ 1 / hω

µτ  / ρ = (N o  / A)στ ,  στ  ~ Z 5 / (hω)7 / 2

(18.16) 

µκ  / ρ= (N o  / A)σ κ ,  σκ  ~ Z 2

ln(2hω / me c 2 )  per atom 

(18.17) 

It should be quite clear by now that the three processes we have studied are not 
equally important for a given region of Z and  hω .  Generally speaking, photoelectric 
effect is important at low energies and high Z, Compton scattering is important at 
intermediate energies ( ~ 1 – 5 Mev) and all Z, and pair production becomes at higher 
energies and high Z.  This is illustrated in Fig. 18.10. 
We also show several mass attenuation coefficients in Figs. 18.11 – 18.13.  One 
should make note of the magnitude of the attenuation coefficients, their energy 
dependence, and the contribution associated with each process.  In comparing theory with 
experiment the agreement is good to about 3 % for all elements at  hω < 10me c 2 .  At 
higher energies disagreement sets in at high Z (can reach ~ 10% for Pb), which is due to 
the use Born approximation in calculating σκ .  If one corrects for this, then agreement to 
within ~ 1% is obtained out to energies ~ 600  me c 2 .
