The sudden deflection of an electron by the Coulomb field of  nuclei can cause 
the electron to radiate, producing a continuous spectrum of x-rays called bremsstrahlung. 
The fraction of electron energy converted into bremsstrahlung increases with increasing 
electron energy and is greater for media of high atomic number.  (This process is 
important in the production of x-rays in conventional x-ray tubes.) 
According to the classical theory of electrodynamics [J. D. Jackson, Classical 
Electrodynamics (Wiley, New York, 1962), p. 509], the acceleration produced by a 
nucleus of charge Ze on an incident particle of charge ze and mass M is proportional to 
Zze2/M.  The intensity of radiation emitted is proportional to (ze  ×  acceleration)2 ~ 
(Zz2e3/M)2 .  Notice the (Z/M)2 dependence; this shows that bremsstrahlung is more 
important in a high-Z medium.  Also it is more important for electrons and positrons than 
for protons and α -particles.  Another way to understand the (Z/M)2 dependence is to 
recall the derivation of stopping power in Lec13 where the momentum change due to a 
collision between the incident particle and a target nucleus is (2ze2/vb) x Z.  The factor Z 
represents the Coulomb field of the nucleus (in Lec13 this was unity since we had an 
atomic electron as the target).  The recoil velocity of the target nucleus is therefore 
proportional to Z/M, and the recoil energy, which is the intensity of the radiation emitted, 
is therefore proportional to (Z/M)2. 
In an individual deflection by a nucleus, the electron can radiate any amount of 
energy up to its kinetic energy T.  The spectrum of bremsstrahlung wavelength for a 
thick target is of the form sketched below, with λmin  = hc / T .  This converts to a 
frequency spectrum which is a constant up the maximum frequency of ν max  = T / h .  The 

1 

shape of the spectrum is independent of Z, and the intensity varies with electron energy 
like 1/T. 
In the quantum mechanical theory of bremsstrahlung a plane wave representing 
the electron enters the nuclear field and is scattered.  There is a small but finite chance 
that a photon will be emitted in the process.  The theory is intimately related to the theory 
of pair production where an electron-positron pair is produced by a photon in the field of 
a nucleus.  Because a radiative process involves the coupling of the electron with the 
electromagnetic field of the emitted photon, the cross sections for radiation are of the 
order of the fine-structure constant [Dicke and Wittke, p. 11],  e 2 / hc ( = 1/137), times the 
cross section for elastic scattering.  This means that most of the deflections of electrons 
by atomic nuclei result in elastic scattering, only in a small number of instances is a 
photon emitted.  Since the classical theory of bremsstrahlung predicts the emission of 
radiation in every collision in which the electron is deflected, it is incorrect.  However, 
when averaged over all collisions the classical and quantum mechanical cross sections are 
of the same order of magnitude,

where  e 2 / me c 2  = re = 2.818 x 10-13 cm is the classical radius of electron.  In the few 
collisions where photons are emitted a relatively large amount of energy is radiated.  In 
this way the quantum theory replaces the multitude of small-energy losses predicted by 
the classical theory by a much smaller number of larger-energy losses.  The spectral 

2 

distributions are therefore different in the two theories, with the quantum description 
being in better agreement with experiments. 
Given a nucleus of charge Ze and an incident electron of kinetic energy T, the 
quantum mechanical differential cross section for the emission of a photon with energy in

Comparison of Various Cross Sections 
It is instructive to compare the cross sections describing the interactions that we 
have considered between an incident electron and the atoms in the medium.  For 
nonrelativistic electrons, T  ≤  0.1 Mev and β= v / c ≤ 0.5 , we have the following cross 
sections (all in barns/atom) [Evans, p. 607],

in the following table [from Evans, p.608].  The difference between σ rad  and σrad   is that 
the former corresponds to fractional loss of total energy,  dT /(T  + me c 2 ) , while the latter 
corresponds to fractional loss of kinetic energy, dT/T.

Mass Absorption
 
Ionization losses per unit distance are proportional to nZ, the number of atomic 
electrons per cm3 in the absorber (medium).  We can express nZ as 

nZ  = (ρN o  / A)Z  = ρN o (Z / A) 

(14.10) 

where  ρ is the mass density, g/cm3, and No the Avogadro’s number.  Since the ratio 
(Z/A) is nearly a constant for all elements, it means that  nZ / ρ is also approximately 
constant (except for hydrogen).  Therefore, if the distance along the path of the charged 
particle is measured in units of  ρdx ≡ dw  (in g/cm2), then the ionization losses, -dT/dw 
(in ergs cm2/g) become more or less independent of the material.  We see in Fig. 14.1, the 
expected behavior of energy loss being material independent holds only approximately, 

5 

as -dT/dw actually decreases as Z increases.  This is due to two reasons, Z/A decreasing 
slightly as Z increases and  I  increasingly linearly with Z.

Fig. 14.1.  Mass absorption energy losses, -dT/dw, for electrons in air, Al, and Pb, 
ionization losses (upper curves) versus bremsstrahlung (lower curves).  All curves refer 
to energy losses along the actual path of the electron.  [Evans, p.609] 

We have seen that ionization losses per path length vary mainly as 1/v2 while 
radiative losses increase with increasing energy.  The two become roughly comparable 
when T >> Mc2, or T >> mec2 in the case of electrons.  The ratio can be approximately 
expressed as

where for electrons, M  →  me.  The two losses are therefore equal in the case of electrons 
for T = 18 mec2 = 9 Mev in Pb and T ~ 100 Mev in water or air. 

Range, Range-Energy Relations, and Track Patterns 
When a charged particle enters an absorbing medium it immediately interacts 
with the many electrons in the medium.  For a heavy charged particle the deflection from 

6 

any individual encounter is small, so the track of the heavy charged particle tends to be 
quite straight except at the very end of its travel when it has lost practically all its kinetic 
energy.  In this case we can estimate the range of the particle, the distance beyond which 
it cannot penetrate, by integrating the stopping power,

(14.12) 

where To is the initial kinetic energy of the particle.  An estimate of R is given by taking 
the Bethe formula, (13.7), for the stopping power and ignoring the v-dependence in the 
logarithm.  Then one finds 

To
R ∝ ∫ TdT  =  To

(14.13) 

This is an example of a range-energy relation.  Given what we have said about the region 
of applicability of (13.7) one might expect this behavior to hold at low energies.  At high 
energies it is more reasonable to take the stopping power to be a constant, in which case 

To
R ∝ ∫ dT  =  T
o
0

 

(14.14)

We will return to see whether such behavior are seen in experiments. 
Experimentally one can determine the energy loss by the number of ion pairs 
produced from an ionization event.  The amount of energy W required for a particle of 
certain energy to produce an ion pair is known.  The number of ion pairs, i, produced per 
unit path length (specific ionization) of the charged particle is then 
dT ⎞
i =  1 ⎛
⎜ − 
⎟ 
W  ⎝  dx  ⎠ 

(14.15)

The quantity W depends on complicated processes such as atomic excitation and 
secondary ionization in addition to primary ionization.  On the other hand, for a given 
material it is approximately independent of the nature of the particle or its kinetic energy.  
For example, in air the values of W are 35.0, 35.2, and 33.3 ev for 5 kev electrons, 5.3 
Mev alphas, and 340 Mev protons respectively. 
The specific ionization is an appropriate measure of the ionization processes 
taking place along the path (track length) of the charged particle.  It is useful to regard 
(14.15) as a function of the distance traveled by the particle.  Such results can be seen in 
Fig. 14.2, where one sees  a characteristic shape of the ionization curve for a heavy 
charged particle.  Ionization is constant or increasing slowly during the early to mid 
stages of the total travel, then it rises more quickly and reaches a peak value at the end of 
the range before dropping sharply to zero.

Fig. 14.2.  Specific ionization of heavy particles in air.  Residual range refers to the 
distance still to travel before coming to rest.  Proton range is 0.2 cm shorter than that of 
the α -particle [Meyerhof, p.80]. 

Proton

We have already mentioned that as the charged particle loses energy and slows 
down, the probability of capturing electron increases.  So the mean charge of a beam of 
particles will decrease with the decrease in their speed (cf. Fig. 13.3).  This is the reason 
why the specific ionization shows a sharp drop.  The value of –dT/dx along a particle 
track is also called specific energy loss.  A plot of –dT/dx along the track of a charged 
particle is known as a Bragg curve.  It should be emphasized that a Bragg curve differs 

8 

from a plot of –dT/dx for an individual particle in that the former is an average over a 
large number of particles.  Hence the Bragg curve includes the effects of straggling 
(statistical distribution of range values for particles having the same initial velocity) and 
has a pronounced tail beyond the extrapolated range as can be seen in Fig. 14.3.

Ri

A typical experimental arrangement for determining the range of charged particles 
is shown in Fig. 14.4.  The mean range  R  is defined as the absorber thickness at which 
the intensity is reduced to one-half of the initial value.  The extrapolated range Ro is 
obtained by linear extrapolation at the inflection point of the transmission curve.  This is 
an example that I/Io is not always an exponential.  In charged particle interactions it is 
not sufficient to think of  I / I o  = e −µx , one should be thinking about the range R.

In practice one uses range-energy relations that are mostly empirically 

determined.  For a rough estimate of the range one can use the Bragg-Kleeman rule, 


ρ1  A 
R 
=
R1  ρ  A1 

(14.16)

where the subscript 1 denotes the reference medium which is conventionally taken to be 
air at 15oC, 760 mm Hg (  A1 = 3.81,  ρ1  = 1.226 x 10-3 g/cm3).  Then 

R = 3.2 x10 − 4  A 
ρ

(14.17)

with  ρ in g/cm3.  In general such an estimate is good to within about  ±  15 percent. 
Figs. 14.5 and 14.6 show the range-energy relations for protons and α -particles in air 
respectively.  Notice that at low energy the variation is quadratic, as predicted by (14.13), 
and at high energy the relation is more or less linear, as given by (14.14).  The same trend 
is also seen in the results for electrons, as shown in Fig. 14.7.

We have mentioned that heavy charged particles traverse essentially in a straight 
line until reaching the end of its range where straggling effects manifest.  In the case of 

11 

electrons large deflections are quite likely during its traversal, so the trajectory of electron 
in a thick absorber is a series of zigzag paths.  While one can still speak of the range R, 
the concept of path length is now of little value.  This is illustrated in Figs. 14.8 and 14.9.  
The total path length S is appreciably greater than the range R

[Evans, p. 612]. 

The transmission curve I/Io for a heavy charged particle was shown in Fig. 14.4. 
The curve has a different characteristic shape for monoenergetic electrons, as indicated in 
Fig. 14.10, and a still different shape for β -rays (electrons with a distribution of 
energies), seen in Fig. 14.11.  Although the curve for monoenergetic electrons depends to 
some extent on experimental arrangement, one may regard it as roughly a linear variation 
which is characteristic of single interaction event in removing the electron.  That is, the 
fraction of electrons getting through is proportional to 1 – P, where P is the interaction 
probability which is in turn proportional to the thickness.  For the β -ray transmission 
curve which essentially has the form of an exponential, the shape is an accidental 
consequence of the β -ray spectrum and of the differences between the scattering and 
absorption of electrons which have various initial energies [cf. Evans, p. 625].  It is found 
empirically that Rm is the same as Ro if the monoenergetic electrons are given the energy 
E = Emax, the maximum energy of the β -ray spectrum (the end-point energy).

Cerenkov Radiation 
Electromagnetic radiation is emitted when a charged particle passes through a 
medium under the condition 

v group  ≡ βc > v phase  ≡ c / n 

(14.15) 

where n is the index of refraction of the medium.  When βn  >1, there is an angle (a 
direction) where constructive interference occurs.  This radiation is a particular form of 
energy loss, due to soft collisions, and is not an additional amount of energy loss.  Soft 
collisions involve small energy transfers from charged particles to distant atoms which 
become excited and subsequently emit coherent radiation (see Evans, p. 589).
