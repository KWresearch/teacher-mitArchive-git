Supplement to Lecture 1:  Nuclear Data Compilation and Evaluation 

As an addendum to our brief overview of basic nuclear concepts (Lec 1) we call 
attention to an important aspect of the study of nuclear phenomena that does not get 
much emphasis in the class room, or at examinations.  This is the topic of how 
information on nuclear data is gathered, analyzed, and made available to users on a 
world-wide basis.  Data compilation and evaluation are continuously on-going activities 
in the development and applications of nuclear science and engineering.  Their 
importance can never be overestimated in view of the critical need for accurate cross 
sections and other data in a nuclear calculation of any practical consequence.  It is not 
surprising that an entire industry has evolved on nuclear data technology which continues 
to play a vital role in the maintainence and improvement of a huge existing database 
which is also expanding.  It is beyond the scope of this class to go into any kind of detail 
on nuclear data beyond a general understanding of what types of data are available. 
We confine our discussion to two sources of nuclear data, the Chart of Nuclides 
and the Table of Isotopes.  The former used to be familiar and commonly available to 
students and faculty as a fold-out insert in a nuclear physics text, or as a wall chart.  The 
latter contains much more voluminous data, the seventh (and the last) edition of which 
has grown by 1978 into a large volume too cumbersome to be carried around.  For the 
purposes of this class the relevant information can be obtained from an on-line versions 
of the Chart of Nuclides, a convenient source being the Table of Nuclides that is 
maintained by the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) – 
http://atom.kaeri.re.kr/ .  This Table provides the basic data on nuclides – mass, half life, 
decay schemes and cross sections.  For special data not available in the Table of 
Nuclides, the student may wish to consult the Table of Isotopes which is admittedly a less 
than convenient reference source. 
In addition, there are many sources of cross section data that have compiled and 
evaluated.  Compilation and evaluation of nuclear data are carried out at many national 
laboratories and research centers all over the world.  In the U.S. the focal point of this 
activity has been the National Neutron Cross Section Center at the Brookhaven National 
Laboratory.  Going back about 20 to 30 years, perhaps the most significant contribution 
of this Center was a library of evaluated nuclear data, known as the Evaluated Nuclear 

1 

Data File (ENDF), which was developed for the storage and retrieval of nuclear data 
needed for neutronic and photonic calculations.  At one time there were two libraries.  
ENDF/A was a collection of useful evaluated data sets.  ENDF/B contained the reference 
data sets recommended by the Cross Section Evaluation Working Group.  At any given 
time there was only evaluated data set for a particular material. Most users were 
concerned only with the B version. 

Evaluation of nuclear data means the assignment of the most credible value after 
consideration of all the pertinent information.  The evaluation was supported by 
documentation giving a description of how the value was determined and an estimate of 
its uncertainty.  As of 1975 the information contained in ENDF consisted of:  Resonance 
parameters, cross section tables, angular distributions, energy distributions, double 
differential data in angle and energy, scattering law data, and fission parameters. 
For a brief look at the contents of ENDF/B library, we note that ENDF/B-II 
contained 3 basic types of data stored on 13 magnetic tapes. 
1.  Scattering law data for 12 moderator materials.  For example,  S (
,α β)  for a series of 
temperatures, 10 temperatures between 296oK and 2000oK in the case of graphite. 

2.  Neutron cross sections for 78 fissile, fertile, structural, and other materials, each being 
an element or an isotope -- total and any significant partial cross sections, reactions 
producing outgoing neutrons, angular and energy distributions, radioactive decay chain 
data, fission product yield, 
 .ν E 
)
(

3.  Photon interaction cross sections for 87 elements from Z = 1 to 94 -- photon cross 
sections, angular and energy distributions of secondary photons. 

Over the years a number of active compilation groups have issued library files:  KEDAK 
from Karlsruhe, Germany, JAERI (Japan), UKNDL from England, and various libraries 
from U.S. national laboratories such as Oak Ridge, Los Alamos, and Lawrence 
Livermore.
