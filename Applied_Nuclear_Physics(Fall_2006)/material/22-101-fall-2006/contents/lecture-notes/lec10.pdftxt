________________________________________________________________________ 

There are similarities between the electronic structure of atoms and nuclear 
structure.  Atomic electrons are arranged in orbits (energy states) subject to the laws of 
quantum mechanics.  The distribution of electrons in these states follows the Pauli 
exclusion principle.  Atomic electrons can be excited up to normally unoccupied states, 
or they can be removed completely from the atom.  From such phenomena one can 
deduce the structure of atoms.  In nuclei there are two groups of like particles, protons 
and neutrons.  Each group is separately distributed over certain energy states subject also 
to the Pauli exclusion principle.  Nuclei have excited states, and nucleons can be added to 
or removed from a nucleus. 
Electrons and nucleons have intrinsic angular momenta called intrinsic spins.  The 
total angular momentum of a system of interacting particles reflects the details of the 
forces between particles. For example, from the coupling of electron angular momentum 
in atoms we infer an interaction between the spin and the orbital motion of an electron in 
the field of the nucleus (the spin-orbit coupling).  In nuclei there is also a coupling 
between the orbital motion of a nucleon and its intrinsic spin (but of different origin).  In 
addition, nuclear forces between two nucleons depend strongly on the relative orientation 
of their spins. 
The structure of nuclei is more complex than that of atoms.  In an atom the 
nucleus provides a common center of attraction for all the electrons and inter-electronic 
forces generally play a small role.  The predominant force (Coulomb) is well understood.  

1 

Nuclei, on the other hand, have no center of attraction; the nucleons are held together by 
their mutual interactions which are much more complicated than Coulomb interactions. 
All atomic electrons are alike, whereas there are two kinds of nucleons.  This 
allows a richer variety of structures.  Notice that there are ~ 100 types of atoms, but more 
than 1000 different nuclides.  Neither atomic nor nuclear structures can be understood 
without quantum mechanics.   
Experimental Basis 
There exists considerable experimental evidence pointing to the shell-like 
structure of nuclei, each nucleus being an assembly of nucleons.  Each shell can be filled 
with a given number of nucleons of each kind.  These numbers are called magic numbers; 
they are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126.  (For the as yet undiscovered superheavy nuclei the 
magic numbers are expected to be N = 184, 196, (272), 318, and Z = 114, (126), 164 
[Marmier and Sheldon, p. 1262].)  Nuclei with magic number of neutrons or protons, or 
both, are found to be particularly stable, as can be seen from the following data. 
Fig. 9.1 shows the abundance of stable isotones (same N) is particularly large

nuclei with one more neutron than the magic numbers, where

(9.1) 

This means that nuclei with magic neutron numbers are more tightly bound.

Simple Shell Model 
The basic assumption of the shell model is that the effects of internuclear 
interactions can be represented by a single-particle potential.  One might think that with 
very high density and strong forces, the nucleons would be colliding all the time and 
therefore cannot maintain a single-particle orbit.  But, because of Pauli exclusion the 
nucleons are restricted to only a limited number of allowed orbits.  A typical shell-model 
potential is 

V (r ) = −

V
o	
1 + exp[(r − R) / a] 

 

 

 

 

(9.1)

 

where typical values for the parameters are Vo ~ 57 Mev, R ~ 1.25A1/3 F, a ~ 0.65 F.  In 
addition one can consider corrections to the well depth arising from (i) symmetry energy 
from an unequal number of neutrons and protons, with a neutron being able to interact 
with a proton in more ways than n-n or p-p (therefore n-p force is stronger than n-n and 
p-p), and (ii) Coulomb repulsion.  For a given spherically symmetric potential V(r), one 

5 

can examine the bound-state energy levels that can be calculated from radial wave 
equation for a particular orbital angular momentum  l ,

(9.2)

Fig. 9.5 shows the energy levels of the nucleons for an infinite spherical well and a 
harmonic oscillator potential, V (r ) = mω 2 r 2  / 2 .  While no simple formulas can be given 
for the former, for the latter one has the expression 

Eν = hω(ν+ 3 / 2) = hω(n x  + n y  + n z  + 3 / 2) 

(9.3) 

where ν = 0, 1, 2, …, and nx, ny, nz = 0, 1, 2, … are quantum numbers.  One should 
notice the degeneracy in the oscillator energy levels.  The quantum number ν can be 
divided into radial quantum number n (1, 2, …) and orbital quantum numbers  l  (0, 1, 
…) as shown in Fig. 9.5.  One can see from these results that a central force potential is 
able to account for the first three magic numbers, 2, 8, 20, but not the remaining four, 28, 
50, 82, 126.  This situation does not change when more rounded potential forms are used.  
The implication is that something very fundamental about the single-particle interaction 
picture is missing in the description.

Fig. 9.5.  Energy levels of nucleons in (a) infinite spherical well (range R = 8F) and (b) a 
parabolic potential well.  In the spectroscopic notation (n,  l ), n refers to the number of 
times the orbital angular momentum state  l  has appeared.  Also shown at certain levels 
are the cumulative number of nucleons that can be put into all the levels up to the 
indicated level [from Meyerhof].  
Shell Model with Spin-Orbit Coupling 
It remains for M. G. Mayer and independently Haxel, Jensen, and Suess to show 
(1949) that an essential missing piece is an attractive interaction between the orbital 
angular momentum and the intrinsic spin angular momentum of the nucleon.  To take 
into account this interaction we add a term to the Hamiltonian H, 

H  = 

p 
2
2m 

+ V (r ) + V  (r ) s ⋅ L 
so 

(9.4)

where Vso is another central potential (known to be attractive).  This modification means 
that the interaction is no longer spherically symmetric; the Hamiltonian now depends on 
the relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momenta.  It is beyond the scope of 
this class to go into the bound-state calculations for this Hamiltonian.  In order to 
understand the meaning of the results of such calculations (eigenvalues and 
eigenfunctions) we need to digress somewhat to discuss the addition of two angular 
momentum operators. 
The presence of the spin-orbit coupling term in (9.4) means that we will have a 
different set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the new description.  What are these 
new quantities relative to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues we had for the problem 
without the spin-orbit coupling interaction?  We first observe that in labeling the energy 
levels in Fig. 9.5 we had already taken into account the fact that the nucleon has an 
orbital angular momentum (it is in a state with a specified  l ), and that it has an intrinsic 
spin of ½ (in unit of  h ).  For this reason the number of nucleons that we can put into each 
level has been counted correctly.  For example, in the 1s ground state one can put two 
nucleons, for zero orbital angular momentum and two spin orientations (up and down).  

7 

The student can verify that for a state of given  l , the number of nucleons that can go into 
that state is 2(2 l +1).  This comes about because the eigenfunctions we are using to 
describe the system is a representation that diagonalizes the square of the orbital angular 
momentum operator L2, its z-component, Lz, the square of the intrinsic spin angular 
momentum operator S2, and its z-component Sz.  Let us use the following notation to 
label these eigenfunctions (or representation), 

l, m

where  Y

(9.7) 

The properties of  χs  with respect to operations by S2 and Sz completely mirror the 
ms
m  with respect to L2 and Lz.  Going back to our representation (9.5) we 
properties of  Y

see that the eigenfunction is a “ket” with indices which are the good quantum numbers 
for the problem, namely, the orbital angular momentum and its projection (sometimes 
called the magnetic quantum number m, but here we use a subscript to denote that it goes 
with the orbital angular momentum), the spin (which has the fixed value of ½) and its 
projection (which can be +1/2 or -1/2). 
The representation given in (9.5) is no longer a good representation when the 
spin-orbit coupling term is added to the Hamiltonian. It turns out that the good 
representation is just a linear combination of the old representation.  It is sufficient for 
our purpose to just know this, without going into the details of how to construct the linear 

8 

combination.  To understand the properties of the new representation we now discuss 
angular momentum addition. 
The two angular momenta we want to add are obviously the orbital angular 
momentum operator L and the intrinsic spin angular momentum operator S, since they 
are the only angular momentum operators in our problem.  Why do we want to add them? 
The reason lies in (9.4).  Notice that if we define the total angular momentum as 

we can then write 

j = S + L 

 

 

 

 

(9.8)

 

S ⋅ L = ( j 2  − S 2  − L2 ) / 2 

(9.9) 

so the problem of diagonalizing (9.4) is the same as diagonalizing  j2, S2, and L2.  This is 
then the basis for choosing our new representation.  In analogy to (9.5) we will denote the 
jm j ls  , which has the properties 
new eigenfunctions by 

j 2  jm j ls  =  j ( j + 1)h

2  jm j ls  , 

l − s  ≤  j ≤ l + s 

j z  jm j ls  = m j h  jm j ls  , 

− j ≤ m j  ≤  j 

L2  jm j ls  = l(l + 1)h

2  jm j ls  , 

l  = 0, 1, 2, … 

S 2  jm j ls  = s ( s + 1)h

2  jm j ls  , 

s = ½ 

(9.10) 

(9.11) 

(9.12) 

(9.13) 

In (9.10) we indicate the values that j can take for given  l  and s (=1/2 in our discussion), 
the lower (upper) limit corresponds to when S and L are antiparallel (parallel) as shown 
in the sketch.

Returning now to the energy levels of the nucleons in the shell model with spin-orbit 
coupling we can understand the conventional spectroscopic notation where the value of j 
is shown as a subscript. 

This is then the notation in which the shell-model energy levels are displayed in Fig. 9.6.

For a given ( n, l,  j ) level, the nucleon occupation number is 2j+1.  It would appear that 
having 2j+1 identical nucleons occupying the same level would violate the Pauli 
exclusion principle.  But this is not the case since each nucleon would have a distinct 
value of mj (this is why there are 2j+1 values of mj for a given j). 
We see in Fig. 9.6 the shell model with spin-orbit coupling gives a set of energy 
levels having breaks at the seven magic numbers.  This is considered a major triumph of 
the model, for which Mayer and Jensen were awarded the Noble prize in physics.  For 
our purpose we will use the results of the shell model to predict the ground-state spin and 
parity of nuclei.  Before going into this discussion we leave the student with the 
following comments. 
1.	 The shell model is most useful when applied to closed-shell or near closed-shell 
nuclei. 
2.	 Away from closed-shell nuclei collective models taking into account the rotation 
and vibration of the nucleus are more appropriate. 
3.	 Simple versions of the shell model do not take into account pairing forces, the 
effects of which are to make two like-nucleons combine to give zero orbital 
angula momentum. 
4.	 Shell model does not treat distortion effects (deformed nuclei) due to the 
attraction between one or more outer nucleons and the closed-shell core.  When 
the nuclear core is not spherical, it can exhibit “rotational” spectrum. 
Prediction of Ground-State Spin and Parity 
There are three general rules for using the shell model to predict the total angular 
momentum (spin) and parity of a nucleus in the ground state.  These do not always work, 
especially away from the major shell breaks. 
1.	 Angular momentum of odd-A nuclei is determined by the angular momentum of 
the last nucleon in the species (neutron or proton) that is odd. 
2.	 Even-even nuclei have zero ground-state spin, because the net angular momentum 
associated with even N and even Z is zero, and even parity. 
In odd-odd nuclei the last neutron couples to the last proton with their intrinsic 
spins in parallel orientation. 

3.	

11 

To illustrate how these rules work, we consider an example for each case.  Consider 
the odd-A nuclide Be9 which has 4 protons and 5 neutrons.  With the last nucleon being 
the fifth neutron, we see in Fig. 9.6 that this nucleon goes into the state 1 p3 / 2  ( l =1, 
j=3/2).  Thus we would predict the spin and parity of this nuclide to be 3/2-.  For an even-
even nuclide we can take A36, with 18 protons and neutrons, or Ca40, with 20 protons and 
neutrons.  For both cases we would predict spin and parity of 0+.  For an odd-odd nuclide 
we take Cl38, which has 17 protons and 21 neutrons.  In Fig. 9.6 we see that the 17th 
proton goes into the state 1d 3 / 2  ( l =2, j=3/2), while the 21st neutron goes into the state 
1 f 7 / 2  ( l =3, j=7/2).  From the  l  and j values we know that for the last proton the orbital 
and spin angular momenta are pointing in opposite direction (because j is equal to  l -1/2).  
For the last neutron the two momenta are pointing in the same direction (j =  l  +1/2). 
Now the rule tells us that the two spin momenta are parallel, therefore the orbital angular 
momentum of the odd proton is pointing in the opposite direction from the orbital angular 
momentum of the odd neutron, with the latter in the same direction as the two spins.  
Adding up the four angular momenta, we have +3+1/2+1/2-2 = 2.  Thus the total angular 
momentum (nuclear spin) is 2.  What about the parity?  The parity of the nuclide is the 
product of the two parities, one for the last proton and the other for the last neutron.  
Recall that the parity of a state is determined by the orbital angular momentum quantum 
number  l , π= (−1) l  .  So with the proton in a state with  l  = 2, its parity is even, while 
the neutron in a state with  l  = 3 has odd parity.  The parity of the nucleus is therefore 
odd. Our prediction for Cl38 is then 2-.  The student can verify, using for example the 
Nuclide Chart, the foregoing predictions are in agreement with experiment. 
Potential Wells for Neutrons and Protons 
We summarize the qualitative features of the potential wells for neutrons and 
protons.  If we exclude the Coulomb interaction for the moment, then the well for a 
proton is known to be deeper than that for a neutron. The reason is that in a given nucleus 
usually there are more neutrons than protons, especially for the heavy nuclei, and the n-p 
interactions can occur in more ways than either the n-n or p-p interactions on account of 

12 

the Pauli exclusion principle.  The difference in well depth  ∆V s  is called the symmetry 
energy; it is approximately given by 
∆V s  = ±27 ( N − Z )  Mev 
A 

(9.14)

where the (+) and (-) signs are for protons and neutrons respectively.  If we now consider 
the Coulomb repulsion between protons, its effect is to raise the potential for a proton.  In 
other words, the Coulomb effect is a positive contribution to the nuclear potential which 
is larger at the center than at the surface. 
Combining the symmetry and the Coulomb effects we have a sketch of the 
potential for a neutron and a proton as indicated in Fig. 9.7.  One can also estimate the

well depth in each case using the Fermi Gas model.  One assumes the nucleons of a fixed 
kind behave like a fully degenerate gas of fermions (degeneracy here means that the 
states are filled continuously starting from the lowest energy state and there are no 
unoccupied states below the occupied ones), so that the number of states occupied is 
equal to the number of nucleons in the particular nucleus.  This calculation is carried out 
separately for neutrons and protons.  The highest energy state that is occupied is called 
the Fermi level, and the magnitude of the difference between this state and the ground 

13 

state is called the Fermi energy EF.  It turns out that EF is proportional to n2/3, where n is 
the number of nucleons of a given kind, therefore EF (neutron) > EF (proton).  The sum of 
EF and the separation energy of the last nucleon provides an estimate of the well depth.  
(The separation energy for a neutron or proton is about 8 Mev for many nuclei.)  Based 
on these considerations one obtains the results shown in Fig. 9.8.

We have so far considered only a spherically symmetric nuclear potential well.  
2  / 2mr 2 and a 
We know there is in addition a centrifugal contribution of the form  l(l + 1)h
spin-orbit contribution.  As a result of the former the well becomes narrower and 
shallower for the higher orbital angular momentum states.  Since the spin-orbit coupling 
is attractive, its effect depends on whether S is parallel or anti-parallel to L.  The effects 
are illustrated in Figs. 9.9 and 9.10.  Notice that for  l  = 0 both are absent. 
We conclude this chapter with the remark that in addition to the bound states in 
the nuclear potential well there exist also virtual states (levels) which are positive energy 
states in which the wave function is large within the potential well.  This can happen if 
the deBroglie wavelength is such that approximately standing waves are formed within 
the well.  (Correspondingly, the reflection coefficient at the edge of the potential is large.)  

14 

A virtual level is therefore not a bound state; on the other hand, there is a non-negligible 
probability that inside the nucleus a nucleon can be found in such a state.  See Fig. 9.11.
