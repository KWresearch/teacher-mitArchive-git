A nucleus in an excited state is unstable because it can always undergo a 
transition (decay) to a lower-energy state of the same nucleus.  Such a transition will be 
accompanied by the emission of gamma radiation.  A nucleus in either an excited or 
ground state also can undergo a transition to a lower-energy state of another nucleus. 
This decay is accomplished by the emission of a particle such as an alpha, electron or 
positron, with or without subsequent gamma emission.  A nucleus which undergoes a 
transition spontaneously, that is, without being supplied with additional energy as in 
bombardment, is said to be radioactive.  It is found experimentally that naturally 
occurring radioactive nuclides emit one or more of the three types of radiations, 
α− particles, β− particles, and γ− rays.  Measurements of the energy of the nuclear 
radiation provide the most direct information on the energy-level structure of nuclides.  
One of the most extensive compilations of radioisotope data and detailed nuclear level 
diagrams is the Table of Isotopes, edited by Lederer, Hollander and Perlman. 
In this chapter we will supplement our previous discussions of beta decay and 
radioactive decay by briefly examining the study of decay constants, selection rules, and 
some aspects of  α− , β− , and γ− decay energetics. 

Alpha Decay 
Most radioactive substances are α− emitters.  Most nuclides with A > 150 are 
unstable against α− decay. α− decay is very unlikely for light nuclides.  The decay 
constant decreases exponentially with decreasing Q-value, here called the decay 
energy, λα  ~ exp(−c / v) , where c is a constant and v the speed of the α− particle,

v ∝  Qα  .  The momentum and energy conservation equations are quite straightforward 
in this case, as can be seen in Fig. 20.1.

(20.4) 

This shows that the kinetic energy of the α -particle is always less than  Qα .  Since  Qα > 
0 ( Tα is necessarily positive), it follows that α -decay is an exothermic process.   The

various energies involved in the decay process can be displayed in an energy-level 
diagram shown in Fig. 20.2.  One can see at a glance how the rest masses and

the kinetic energies combine to ensure energy conservation.  We will see in the next 
lecture that energy-level diagrams are also useful in depicting collision-induced nuclear 
reactions.  The separation energy  Sα  is the work necessary to separate an α -particle 
from the nucleus, 

Sα = [M ( A − 4, Z − 2) + Mα − M ( A, Z )]c 2 

(20.5) 

=  B( A, Z ) − B( A − 4, Z − 2) − B(4,2)  =  − Qα 
One can use the semi-empirical mass formula to determine whether a nucleus is stable 
against α -decay.  In this way one finds  Qα  > 0 for A > 150.  Eq.(20.5) also shows that 
when the daughter nucleus is magic, B(A-4,Z-2) is large, and  Qα  is large.  Conversely, 
Qα  is small when the parent nucleus is magic. 
Estimating α -decay Constant 
An estimate of the decay constant can be made by treating the decay as a barrier 
penetration problem, an approach proposed by Gamow (1928) and also by Gurney and 
Condon (1928).  The idea is to assume the α -particle already exists as a particle inside 
the daughter nucleus where it is confined by the Coulomb potential, as illustrated in Fig. 
20.3.  The decay constant is then the probability per unit time that it can tunnel through 
the potential,

(20.6)

where  v  is the relative speed of the α and the daughter nucleus, R is the radius of the 
daughter nucleus, and P the transmission coefficient.  Eq.(20.6) is a standard form for 
describing tunneling probability in the form of a rate.  The prefactor ν / R  is the attempt 
frequency, the rate at which the particle tries to tunnel through the barrier, and P is the 
probability of tunneling for each try. Recall from our study of barrier penetration (cf. 
Chap 5, eq. (5.20)) that the transmission coefficient can be written in the form 

P ~ e −γ

(20.9)

where y = R/b =  Qα /B, B = 2ZDe2/R,  Qα  = µv 2  / 2 = 2Z D e 2 / b .  Typically B is a few 
tens or more Mev, while  Qα  ~ a few Mev.  One can therefore invoke the thick barrier 
approximation, in which case b >> R (or  Qα  << B), and y << 1.  Then

where µ is the reduced mass.  Since Gamow was the first to study this problem, the 
exponent is sometimes known as the Gamow factor G. 
To illustrate the application of (20.13) we consider estimating the decay constant 
of the 4.2 Mev α-particle emitted by U238.  Ignoring the small recoil effects, we can 
write 

Tα ~ 1 
µv 2  → v  ~ 1.4 x 109 cm/s,   µ ~  M α

Thus 

As a result our estimate is 

P = e −90  ~ 10 −39 

(20.14) 

λα ~ 1.7 x10 −18  s-1,  or  t1/2 ~ 1.3 x 1010 yrs 
  

The experimental half-life is ~ 0.45 x 1010 yrs.  Considering our estimate is very rough, 
the agreement is rather remarkable.  In general one should not expect to predict λα  to be 
better than the correct order of magnitude (say a factor of 5 to 10).  Notice that in our 
example, B ~ 30 Mev and  Qα  = 4.2 Mev.  Also b = RB/ Qα = 61 x 10-13 cm.  So the thick 
barrier approximation, B >>  Qα  or b >> R, is indeed well justified. 
The theoretical expression for the decay constant provides a basis for an empirical 
relation between the half-life and the decay energy.  Since t1/2 = 0.693/α , we have from 
(20.13) 

ln(t1 / 2 ) = ln(0.693R / v ) + 4πZ D e  / hv −

(20.15)

We note R ~A1/3 ~  Z D 
1 / 3  , so the last term varies with ZD like  Z D 
2 / 3 .  Also, in the second 
trerm v  ∝  Qα  .  Therefore (20.15) suggests the following relation, 

log(t1 / 2 ) = a + 

b
Qα 

(20.16)

6 

with a and b being parameters depending only on ZD.  A relation of this form is known as 
the Geiger-Nuttall rule. 
We conclude our brief consideration of α -decay at this point.  For further 
discussions the student should consult Meyerhof (Chap 4) and Evans (Chap 16). 

Beta Decay 
Beta decay is considered to be a weak interaction since the interaction potential is 
~ 10-6 that of nuclear interactions, which are generally regarded as strong.  
Electromagnetic and gravitational interactions are intermediate in this sense.   β -decay is 
the most common type of radioactive decay, all nuclides not lying in the “valley of 
stability” are unstable against this transition.  The positrons or electrons emitted in β -
decay have a continuous energy distribution, as illustrated in Fig. 20.4 for the decay of 
Cu64,

The values of  T± (max) are characteristic of the particular radionuclide; they can be 
considered as signatures. 
If we assume that in β -decay we have only a parent nucleus, a daughter nucleus, 
and a β -particle, then we would find that the conservations of energy, linear and angular 
moemnta cannot be all satisfied.  It was then proposed by Pauli (1933) that particles, 
called neutrino ν and antineutrino ν , also can be emitted in β -decay.  The neutrino 
particle has the properties of zero charge, zero (or nearly zero) mass, and intrinsic angular 
momentum (spin) of  h / 2 .  The detection of the neutrino is unusually difficult because it 
has a very long mean-free path.  Its existence was confirmed by Reines and Cowan 
(1953) using the inverse β -decay reaction induced by a neutrino, p +ν → n + β − .  The 
emission of a neutrino (or antineutrino) in the β -decay process makes it possible to 
satisfy the energy conservation condition with a continuous distribution of the kinetic 
energy of the emitted β -particle.  Also, linear and angular momenta are now conserved. 
The energetics of β -decay can be summarized as

positron decay, requiring only the condition MP(Z) > MD(Z-1).  Fig. 20.4 shows how the 
energetics can be expressed in the form of energy-level diagrams.

Typical decay schemes for

β 
there is an assignment of spin and parity.  This information is essential for determining 
whether a transition is allowed according to certain selection rules, as we will discuss 
below.

Experimental half-lives of β -decay have values spread over a very wide range, 
from 10-3 sec to 1016 yrs.  Generally, λβ  ~ Qβ 
5  .  The decay process cannot be explained 
classically.  The theory of β -decay was developed by Fermi (1934) in analogy with the 
quantum theory of electromagnetic decay.  For a discussion of the elements of this theory 
one can  begin with Meyerhof and follow the references given therein.  We will be 
content to mention just one aspect of the theory, that concerning the statistical factor 
describing the momentum and energy distributions of the emitted β particle.  Fig. 20.7 
shows the nuclear coulomb effects on the momentum distribution in β -decay in Ca (Z = 

20).  One can see an enhancement in the case of β− -decay and a suppression in the case 

of β+ -decay at low momenta.  Coulomb effects on the energy distribution are even more 
pronounced.

Selection Rules for Beta Decay 
Besides energy and linear momentum conservation, a nuclear transition must also 
satisfy angular momentum and parity conservation.  This gives rise to selection rules 
which specify whether a particular transition between initial and final states, both with 
specified spin and parity, is allowed, and if allowed what mode of decay is most likely.  
We will work out the selection rules governing β−  and γ -decay.  For the former 
conservation of  angular momentum and parity are generally expressed as 

10 

I P  = I D  + Lβ + S β 

π P  = π D (−1) Lβ 

(20.17) 

(20.18) 

where  Lβ  is the orbital angular momentum and  Sβ  the intrinsic spin of the electron-
antineutrino system.  The magnitude of angular momentum vector can take integral 
values, 0, 1, 2, …, whereas the latter can take on values of 0 and 1 which would 
correspond the antiparallel and parallel coupling of the electron and neutrino spins.  
These two orientations will be called Fermi and Gamow-Teller respectively in what 
follows. 
In applying the conservation conditions, the goal is to find the lowest value of  Lβ 
that will satisfy (20.17) for which there is a corresponding value of  Sβ  that is compatible 
with (20.18).  This then identifies the most likely transition among all the allowed 
transitions.  In other words, all the other allowed transitions with higher values of  Lβ , 
which makes them less likely to occur.  This is because the decay constant is governed by 
the square of a transition matrix element, which in term can be written as a series of 
contributions, one for each  Lβ  (recall the discussion of partial wave expansion in cross 
section calculation, Appendix B, where we also argue that the higher order partial waves 
are less likely the low order ones, ending up with only the s-wave), 

2

2 
2
λβ  ∝  M  =  M ( Lβ = 0)  +  M ( Lβ = 1)  +  M ( Lβ = 2)  + ... 

(20.19) 

Transitions with  Lβ  = 0, 1, 2, … are called allowed, first-borbidden, second-
forbidden,…etc.  The magnitude of the matrix element squared decreases from one order 
to the next higher one by at least a factor of 102.  For this reason we are interested only in 
the lowest order transition that is allowed. 
To illustrate how the selection rules are determined, we consider the transition 

11 

He 6 (0 + )→  Li 6 (1+ )
3 

2

To determine the combination of  Lβ  and  Sβ  for the first transition that is allowed, we 
begin by noting that parity conservation requires  Lβ  to be even.  Then we see that Lβ  = 0 
plus Sβ  = 1 would satisfy both (20.17) and (20.18).  Thus the most likely transition is the 
transition designated as allowed, G-T.  Following the same line of argument, one can 
 
arrive at the following assignments. 

O 14 (0 + )→  N 14 (0 + )

Parity Non-conservation 
The presence of neutrino in β -decay leads to a certain type of non-conservation 
of parity.  It is known that neutrinos have instrinsic spin antiparallel to their velocity, 
whereas the spin orientation of the antineutrino is parallel to their velocity (keeping in 
mind that ν and ν  are different particles).  Consider the mirror experiment where a 
neutrino is moving toward the mirror from the left, Fig. 20.8.  Applying the inversion 
symmetry operation 

12 

Fig. 20.8.  Mirror reflection demonstrating parity non-sonserving property of neutrino.  
(from Meyerhof) 

( x → − x ), the velocity reverses direction, while the angular momentum (spin) does not.  
Thus, on the other side of the mirror we have an image of a particle moving from the 
right, but its spin is now parallel to the velocity so it has to be an antineutrino instead of a 
neutrino.  This means that the property of ν and ν , namely definite spin direction 
relative to the velocity, is not compatible with parity conservation (symmetry under 
inversion). 
For further discussions of beta decay we again refer the student to Meyerhof and 
the references given therein. 

Gamma Decay 
An excited nucleus can always decay to a lower energy state by γ -emission or a 
competing process called internal conversion.  In the latter the excess nuclear energy is 
given directly to an atomic electron which is ejected with a certain kinetic energy.  In 
general, complicated rearrangements of nucleons occur during γ -decay. 
The energetics of γ -decay is rather straightforward.  As shown in Fig. 20. 9 a γ 
is emitted while the nucleus recoils.

Ta  =  p a 
2  / 2M  = h

2 k 2  / 2M  = Eγ 
2  / 2Mc 2 

(20.21) 

Typically,  Eγ  ~ 2 Mev, so if A ~ 50, then Ta ~ 40 ev.  This is generally negligible. 
Decay Constants and Selection Rules 
Nuclear excited states have half-lives for γ -emission ranging from 10-16 sec to > 
100 years.  A rough estimate of λγ  can be made using semi-classical ideas.  From 
Maxewell’s equations one finds that an accelerated point charge e radiates 
electromagnetic radiation at a rate given by the Lamor formula (cf. Jackson, Classical 
Electrodynamics, Chap 17), 

dE 
dt 

=

2 e 2 a 2 
3  c 
3 

(20.22)

where a is the acceleration of the charge.  Suppose the radiating charge has a motion like 
the simple oscillator, 

x(t ) = xo  cosωt 

(20.23) 

2  = R 2 ,  R  being the radius of the nucleus.  From (20.23) we 
where we take  xo 
2  + z o 
2  +  y o 
have 

a (t ) = Rω 2  cosωt 

(20.24) 

To get an average rate of energy radiation, we average (20.22) over a large number of 
oscillation cycles,

significance of a mean lifetime).  Then,

If we apply this result to a process in atomic physics, namely the de-excitation of an atom 
by electromagnetic emission, we would take R ~ 10-8 cm and  Eγ  ~ 1 ev, in which case 
(20.27) gives 

λγ  ~ 10 6  sec −1 , 

or  t1 / 2 ~ 7 x 10-7 sec 
    

On the other hand, if we apply (20.27) to nuclear decay, where typically R ~ 5 x 10-13 cm, 
and  Eγ  ~ 1 Mev, we would obtain 

λγ ~ 1015  sec-1,  or  t1 / 2  ~ 3 x 10-16 sec 
   

These result only indicate typical orders of magnitude.  What Eq.(20.27) does not explain 
is the wide range of values of the half-lives that have been observed.  For further 
discussions we again refer the student to references such as Meyerhof. 
Turning to the question of selection rules for γ -decay, we can write down the 
conservation of angular momenta and parity in a form similar to (20.17) and (20.18), 

I i  = I f  + Lγ 

(20.28) 

15 

π i  = π f πγ 

(20.29) 

Notice that in contrast to (20.27) the orbital and spin angular momenta are incorporated 
in  Lγ , playing the role of the total angular momentum.  Since the photon has spin  h  [for 
a discussion of photon angular momentum, see A. S. Davydov, Quantum Mechanics 
(1965(, pp. 306 and 578], the possible values of  Lγ are 1 (corresponding to the case of 
zero orbital angular momentum), 2, 3, …For the conservation of parity we know the 
parity of the photon depends on the value of  Lγ .  We now encounter two possibilities 
because in photon emission, which is the process of electromagnetic multipole radiation, 
one can have either electric or magnetic multipole radiation, 
πγ  =  (−1) Lγ 
electric multipole 
− (−1) Lγ  

magnetic multipole 

Thus we can set up the following table,

Similar to the case of β -decay, the decay constant can be expressed as a sum of 
contributions from each multipole [cf. Blatt and Weisskopf, Theoretical Nuclear Physics, 
p. 627], 

λγ  = λγ (E1) + λγ (M 1) + λγ (E 2) + ...

provided each contribution is allowed by the selection rules.  We are again interested 
only in the lowest order allowed transition, and if both E and M transitions are allowed, E 
will dominate.  Take, for example, a transition between an initial state with spin and 
parity of 2+ and a final state of 0+.  This transition requires the photon parity to be 
positive, which means that for an electric multipole radiation  Lγ  would have to be even, 
and for a magnetic radiation it has to be odd.  In view of the initial and final spins, we see 
that angular momentum conservation (20.28) requires  Lγ  to be 2.  Thus, the most likely 
mode of γ -decay for this transition is E2.  A few other examples are: 

1+ → 0 +

We conclude this discussion of nuclear decays by the remark that internal 
conversion (IC) is a competing process with γ -decay.  The atomic electron ejected has a 
kinetic energy given by (ignoring nuclear recoil) 

Te  = E i  − E f  − E B 

(20.31) 

where  E i  − E f  is the energy of de-excitation, and  E B  is the binding energy of the atomic 
electron.  If we denote by λe   the decay constant for internal conversion, then the total 
decay constant for de-excitation is 

λ= λγ  + λe
