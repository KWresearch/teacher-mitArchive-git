We are interested in the interactions of gamma rays, electromagnetic radiations 
produced by nuclear transitions.  These are typically photons with energies in the range 
of ~ 0.1 – 10 Mev.  The attenuation of the intensity of a beam of gamma rays in an 
absorber, sketched in Fig. 17.1, follows a true exponential variation with the distance of 
penetration, which is unlike that of charged particles, 

Fig. 17.1.  Attenuation of a beam of gamma radiation through an absorber of thickness x. 

I ( x) = I o e −µx 

(17.1) 

The interaction is expressed through the linear attenuation coefficient µ which does not 
depend on x but does depend on the energy of the incident gamma.  By attenuation we 
mean either scattering or absorption.  Since either process will remove the gamma from 
the beam, the probability of penetrating a distance x is the same as the probability of 
traveling a distance x without any interaction, exp(-µ x).  The attenuation coefficient is 

1 

therefore the probability per unit path of interaction; it is what we would call the 
macroscopic cross section  Σ = Nσ in the case of neutron interaction. 
There are several different processes of gamma interaction.  Each process can be 
treated as occurring independently of the others; for this reason µ is the sum of the 
individual contributions.  These contributions, of course, are not equally important at any 
given energy.  Each process has its own energy variation as well as dependence on the 
atomic number of the absorber .  We will focus our discussions on the three most 
important processes of gamma interaction, Compton scattering, photoelectric effect, and 
pair production.  These can be classified by the object with which the photon interacts 
and the type of process (absorption or scattering), as shown in the matrix below. 
Photoelectric is the absorption of a photon followed by the ejection of an atomic electron.  
Compton scattering is the inelastic (photon loses energy) relativistic scattering by a free 
electron.  For Compton scattering it is implied that the photon energy is at least 
comparable to the rest mass energy of the electron.  If the photon energy is much lower 
than the rest mass energy, the scattering by a free electron then becomes elastic (no 
energy loss), a process that we will call Thomson scattering.  When the photon energy is 
greater than twice the rest mass energy of electron, the photon can be absorbed and an 
 
electron-positron pair is emitted.   This is the process of pair production.  Other 
combinations of interaction and process in the matrix (marked x) could be discussed, but 
they are of no interest to us in this class.

photoelectric effect, and pair production respectively. 

Compton Scattering 
The treatment of Compton scattering is similar to our analysis of neutron 
scattering in several ways.  This analogy should be noted by the student as the discussion 
unfolds here.  The phenomenon is the scattering of a photon with incoming momentum 
h k  by a free, stationary electron, which is treated relativistically.  After scattering at 
angleθ , the photon has momentum  h k ' , while the electron moves off at an angle ϕ with 
momentum  p  and kinetic energy T, as shown in Fig. 17.1. 

Fig. 17.1.  Schematic of Compton scattering at angle θ with momentum and energy 
transferred to the free electron. 

To analyze the kinematics we write the momentum and energy conservation equations, 

h k = h k '+ p 

hck = hck '+T

with c being the speed of light.  One should also recall the relations, ω= ck  and λν = c , 
with ω and  ν being the circular and linear frequency, respectively ( ω= 2πν ), and λ 
the wavelength of the photon.  By algebraic manipulations one can obtain the following 
results.

(17.8)

In (17.5) the factor h/mec = 2.426 x 10-10 cm is called the Compton wavelength.  The gain 
in wavelength after scattering at an angle of θ is known as the Compton shift.  This shift 
in wavelength is independent of the incoming photon energy, whereas the shift in energy 
(17.7) is dependent on energy.  In (17.6) the parameter α= hω / m e c 2   is a measure of the 
photon energy in units of the electron rest mass energy (0.511 Mev).  As α→ 1 , ω' →ω 
and the process goes from inelastic to elastic.  Low-energy photons are scattered with 
only a moderate energy change, while high-energy photons suffer large energy change.  
For example, at θ = π / 2 , if  hω = 10 kev, then  hω'  = 9.8 kev (2% change), but if  hω = 
10 Mev, then  hω'  = 0.49 Mev (20-fold change). 
Eq.(17.7) gives the energy of the recoiling electron which is of interest because 
this is often the quantity that is measured in Compton scattering.  In the limit of energetic 
gammas, α >> 1, the scattered gamma energy becomes only a function of the scattering

angle; it is a minimum for backward scattering ( θ = π ),  hω' = m e c 2  / 2 , while for 90o 
scattering  hω' = m e c 2 .  The maximum energy transfer is given by (17.7) with θ = π ,

Klein-Nishina Cross Section 
The proper derivation of the angular differential cross section for Compton 
scattering requires a quantum mechanical calculation using the Dirac’s relativistic theory 
of the electron.  This was first published in 1928 by Klein and Nishina [for details, see W. 
Heitler].  We will simply quote the formula and discuss some of its implications. The 
cross section is

(17.10) 

where  Θ  is the angle between the electric vector ε (polarization) of the incident photon 

and that of the scattered photon, ε ' .  The diagrams shown in Fig. 17.2 are helpful in 
visualizing the various vectors involved.  Recall that a photon is an electromagnetic wave   

Fig. 17.2.  Angular relations among incoming and outgoing wave vectors,  k  and  k ' , of 
the scattered photon, and the electric vectors, ε and ε ' , which are transverse to the 
corresponding wave vectors.

characterized by a wave vector  k  and an electric vector ε which is perpendicular to  k . 
For a given incident photon with  (k ,ε ) , shown above, we can decompose the scattered 
photon electric vector ε'  into a component ε' ⊥   perpendicular to the plane containing  k 
and ε , and a parallel component ε' C   which lies in this plane.  For the perpendicular 
component  cos Θ ⊥  = 0, and for the parallel component we notice that  

cosγ = cos ⎛

C  = sinθ cosϕ 

(17.11)

Therefore, 

cos 2  Θ = 1 − sin 2 θ cos 2 ϕ 

(17.12) 

The decomposition of the scattered photon electric vector means that the angular 
differential cross section can be written as

(17.14) 

This is because the cross section is proportional to the total scattered intensity which in 
turn is proportional to  (ε ' ) 2 .  Since ε' ⊥  and ε' C  are orthogonal,  (ε' ) 2  =  (ε ' ⊥  )2 + (ε ' C  )2 
and the cross section is the sum of the contributions from each of the components. 
In the low-energy (non-relativistic) limit,  hω << m e c 2 , we have ω' ≈ω , then

This means that if the incident radiation is polarized (photons have a specific polarization 
vector), then the scattered radiation is also polarized.  But if the incident radiation is 
unplolarized, then we have to average  dσC  / dΩ  over all the allowed directions of ε 
(remember ε is perpendicular to  k ).  Since  dσC  / dΩ  depends only on angles θ 
and ϕ , we can obtain the result for unpolarized radiation by averaging over ϕ .  Thus,

with  re  ≡ e 2 / me c 2  = 2.818 x 10-13 cm being the classical radius of the electron (cf. 
   
(14.1)).  This is a well-known expression for the angular differential cross section for 
Thomson scattering.  Integrating this over all solid angles gives

The behavior of  dσC  / dΩ  is shown in Fig. 17.3.  Notice that at any given α the angular 
distribution is peaked in the forward direction.  As α increases, the forward peaking 
becomes more pronounced.  The deviation from Thomson scattering is largest at large 
scattering angles; even at  hω ~  0.1 Mev the assumption of Thomson scattering is not

valid.  In practice the Klein-Nishina cross section has been found to be in excellent 
agreement with experiments at least out to  hω= 10me c 2 . 
To find the total cross section per electron for Compton scattering, one can 
integrate (17.19) over solid angles.  The analytical result is given in Evans, p. 684.  We 
will note only the two limiting cases,

We see that at high energies ( ≥  1 Mev) the Compton cross section decreases with energy 
like 1 / hω . 

Collision, Scattering and Absorption Cross Sections 
In discussing the Compton effect a distinction should be made between collision 
and scattering.  Here collision refers to ordinary scattering in the sense of removal of the 
photon from the beam.  This is what we have been discussing above. Since the electron 
recoils, not all the original energy  hω is scattered, only a fraction ω' /ω is.  Thus one 
can define a scattering cross section, 

dσ sc  =
ω' dσ C 
dΩ ω  dΩ 

(17.21)

This leads to a slightly different total cross section, 

σ sc  ~ 1 − 3α+ 9.4α 2  − ...  α<< 1 
σ o 

(17.22)

Notice that in the case of Thomson scattering all the energy is scattered and none are 
absorbed.  The difference between σ C  and σsc   is called the Compton absorption cross 
section.

Energy Distribution of Compton Electrons and Photons 
We have been discussing the angular distribution of the Compton scattered 
dσ C

we need first to reduce the angular distribution of two angle variables, θ and ϕ , to a 
distribution in θ (in the same way as we had done in Chapter 15).  We therefore define

(17.24)

with ω'  and θ being related through (17.6).  Since we can also relate the scattering angle 
θ to the angle of electron recoil φ through (17.8), we can obtain the distribution of 
electron energy by performing two transformations, from θ to φ first, then from φ to T 
by using the relation

show several calculated electron recoil energy distributions which can be compared with 
the experimental data shown in Fig. 17.5.

For a given incident gamma energy the recoil energy is maximum at θ = π , where  hω'  is 
smallest.  We had seen previously that if the photon energy is high enough, the outgoing 
photon energy is a constant at ~0.255 Mev.  In Fig. 17.4 we see that for incident photon 
energy of 2.76 Mev the maximum electron recoil energy is approximately 2.53 Mev, 
which is close to the value of (2.76 – 0.255).  This correspondence should hold even 
better at higher energies, and not as well at lower energies, such as 1.20 and 0.51 Mev.  

11 

We can also see by comparing Figs. 17.4 and 17.5 that the relative magnitudes of the 
distributions at the two lower incident energies match quite well between calculation and 
experiment.  The distribution peaks near the cutoff Tmax because there is an appreciable 
range of θ near θ = π , where cosθ ~ 1 (cosine changes slowly in this region) and so 
hω'  remains close to mec2/2.  This feature is reminiscent of the Bragg curve depicting the 
specific ionization of a charged particle (Fig. (14.3)).
