We will solve the SchrÃ¶dinger wave equation by considering the simplest 
problem in quantum mechanics, a particle in a potential well.  The student will see from 
this calculation how the problem is treated by dividing the system into two regions, the 
interior where the particle feels the potential, and the exterior where the particle is a free 
particle (zero potential).  The solutions to the wave equation have to be different in these 
two regions to reflect the binding of the particle - the wave function is oscillatory in the 
interior region and exponentially decaying (non-oscillatory) in the exterior region. 
Matching these two solutions at the boundary where the potential goes from a finite value 
(interior) to zero (exterior) gives a condition on the wavenumber (or wavelength), which 
turns out to be the condition of quantization.  The meaning of quantization is that 
solutions exist only if the wavenumbers take on certain discrete values, which then 
translate into discrete energy levels for the particle.  For a given potential well of certain 
depth and width, only a discrete set of wave functions can exist in the potential well. 
These wave functions are the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (energy) operator, with 
corresponding energy levels as the eigenvalues.  Finding the wavefunctions and the 
spectrum of eigenvalues is what we mean by solving the SchrÃ¶dinger wave equation for 
the particle in a potential well.  Changing the shape of the potential means a different set 
of eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues.  The procedure to find them, however, is the same. 
For a one-dimensional system the time-independent wave equation is 

 ! 2  d 2\( x)

 V ( x)\( x)  E\( x) 

(3.1)

We will use this equation to investigate the bound-states of a particle in a square well 
potential of depth Vo and width L.  The physical meaning of (3.1) is essentially the 

1 

statement of energy conservation, the total energy E, a negative and constant quantity in 
the present problem of bound-state calculations, is the sum of kinetic and potential 
energies.  Since (3.1) holds at every point in space, the fact that the potential energy V(x) 
varies in space means the kinetic energy of the particle also will vary in space.  For a 
square well potential, V(x) has the form 

V ( x)  Vo

we divide the configuration space (our entire system) into an interior region, where the 
potential is constant and negative, and an exterior region where the potential is zero.  For 
the interior region the wave equation can be put into the standard form of a second-order 
differential equation with constant coefficient,

In (3.3) we purposely introduced the wavenumber k, with  k 2
positive, so that k is real.  (As an aside note that we will be doing this consistently in 

2 

writing out the wave equation to be solved.  In other words, the wavenumber we 
introduce is always real, whereas the sign of the second term in the wave equation can be 
plus, as seen in (3.3), or minus, as in (3.4).)  For k2 to be positive we understand that the 
solutions where â€“E > Vo will be excluded from our considerations. 
For the exterior region, the wave equation similarly can be put into the form 

d 2\( x)

(3.4)

where N2  2mE / ! 2 .  To obtain the solutions of physical interest to (3.3) and (3.4), we 
keep in mind that the solutions should have certain symmetry properties, in this case they 
should have definite parity, or inversion symmetry (see below).  This means that when 
x o -x, \( x)  must be either invariant or it must change sign.  The reason for this 
requirement is that the Hamiltonian H is symmetric under inversion (the potential is 
symmetric given our choice of the coordinate system (see Fig. 1)).  Thus we take for our 
solutions

We have used the condition of definite parity in choosing the interior solution as a sine 
function, an odd function.  The choice of a solution with odd parity is arbitrary because 
an even-parity solution, coskx, would be equally acceptable.  What about a linear 
combination of the two solutions, such as the sum, Asinkx + Bcoskx?  This particular 
choice would not be acceptable because the sum of an odd and even parity solutions 
violates the requirement that all solutions must have definite parity. 
For the exterior region we have applied condition (i) in Lec2 to discard the 
exponentially growing solution.  This is justified on physical grounds; for a bound state 

3 

the particle should be mostly localized inside the potential well, which is another way of 
saying that away from the well the wave function should be decaying rather than 
growing. 
In the solutions we have chosen there are three constants of integration, A, B, and 
C.  These are to be determined by applying boundary conditions at the interface between 
the interior and exterior regions, plus a normalization condition (2.23).  Notice there is 
another constant in the problem which has not been specified, the energy eigenvalue E. 
All we have said thus far is that E should be negative.  We have already utilized the 
boundary condition at infinity and the inversion symmetry condition of definite parity. 
The conditions which we have not yet applied are the continuity conditions (ii) and (iii) 
in Lec2.  At the interface,  xo  r L / 2  , the boundary conditions are

with subscripts int and ext denoting the interior and exterior solutions respectively. 
The four conditions at the interface do not allow us to determine the four 
constants because our system of equations is homogeneous.  As in situations of this kind, 
the proportionality constant is fixed by the normalization condition (2.23).  We therefore 
obtain C = -B,  B A sin(kL / 2) exp(NL / 2)  , and 

cot(kL / 2)  N / k

 

 

 

 

(3.8)

 

with the constant A determined by (2.23).  Eq.(3.8)is the most important result of this 
calculation; it is sometimes called a dispersion relation.  It is a relation which determines 
the allowed values of E, a quantity that appears in both k and N .  These are then the 
discrete (quantized) energy levels which the particle can have in the particular potential 
well given, a square well of width L and depth Vo.  Eq.(3.8) is the consequence of 

4 

choosing odd-parity solutions for the interior wave. For the even-parity solutions, 
\int ( x)  A' cos kx , the corresponding dispersion relation is 

tan(kL / 2)   N/ k

 

 

 

 

(3.9)

 

Since both solutions are equally acceptable, one has two distinct sets of energy levels, 
given implicitly by (3.8) and (3.9).  To see what are these levels more explicitly, further 
analysis is necessary. 
We consider a graphical analysis of (3.8) and (3.9).  We first put the two 
equations into dimensionless form, 
[cot[  K 

(odd-parity) 

(3.10) 

[tan[ K  

(even-parity) 

(3.11) 

where [  kL / 2 ,  K NL / 2 .  Then we notice that 

[2  K2

(3.12)

 

is a constant for fixed values of Vo and L.  In Fig. 4 we plot the left- and right-hand sides 
of (3.10) and (3.11), and obtain from their intersections the allowed energy levels.  The 
graphical method thus reveals the following features.  There exists a minimum value of

parity solutions if  / is not large enough (the potential is not deep enough or not wide 
enough), while there is at least one even-parity solution no matter what values are the 
well depth and width. 

/ below which no odd-parity solutions are allowed.  On the other hand, there is always at 
least one even-parity solution.  The first even-parity energy level occurs at [ S / 2 ,  
whereas the first odd-parity level occurs at  S / 2   [ S .  Thus, the even- and odd-
parity levels alternate in magnitudes, with the lowest level being even in parity.  We 
should also note that the solutions depend on the potential function parameters only 
through the variable  / , or the combination of VoL2, so that the effect of any change in 
well depth can be compensated by a change in the square of the well width. 
At this point it can be noted that we anticipate that for a particle in a potential well 
in three dimensions (next chapter), the cosine solution to the wave function has to be 
discarded because of the condition of regularity (wave function must be finite) at the 
origin.  This means that there will be a minimum value of  / or VoL2 below which no 
bound states can exist.  This is a feature of problems in three dimensions which does not 
apply to problems in one dimension. 
We now summarize our results for the allowed energy levels of a particle in a 
square well potential and the corresponding wave functions.

sketch of the three lowest-level solutions, the ground state with even parity, the first 
excited state with odd parity, and the second excited state with even parity.  Notice that 
the number of excited states that one can have depends on the value of Vo because our  
solution is valid only for negative E.  This means that for a potential of a given depth, the 
particle can be bound only in a finite number of states.

To obtain more explicit results it is worthwhile to consider an approximation to 
the boundary condition at the interface.  Instead of the continuity of \ and its derivative 
at the interface, one might assume that the penetration of the wave function into the 
external region can be neglected, and therefore require that \ vanishes at  x  r L / 2  . 
Applying this condition to (3.13) gives  kL  nS, where n is any integer, or equivalently,

n = 1, 2, â€¦ 

(3.16)

This shows explicitly how the energy eigenvalue En varies with the level index n, which 
is the quantum number for the one-dimensional problem under consideration.  The 
corresponding wave functions under this approximation are 

\n ( x)  An  cos(nSx / L) , 

n = 1, 3, â€¦ 

=  A '  sin(nSx / L)

n = 2, 4, â€¦ 

(3.17)

The first solutions in this approximate calculation are also shown in Fig. 5.  We see that 
requiring the wave function to vanish at the interface has the effect of confining the 
particle in a potential well of width L with infinitely steep walls (the infinite well 
potential or limit of Vo  o f ).  It is therefore to be expected that the problem becomes 
independent of Vo and there is no limit on the number of excited states.  Clearly, the 
approximate solutions become the more useful the greater is the well depth, and the error 
is always an overestimate of the energy levels as a result of squeezing of the wave 
function (physically, this makes the wave have a shorter period or a larger wavenumber).
