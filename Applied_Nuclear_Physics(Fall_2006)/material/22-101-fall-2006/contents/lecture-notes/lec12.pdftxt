The binding energy curve we have discussed in the last lecture is an overall 
representation of how the stability of nuclides varies across the entire range of mass 
number A.  The curve shown in Fig. 10.1 was based on experimental data on atomic 
masses.  One way to analyze this curve is to decompose the binding energy into various 
contributions from the interactions among the nucleons.  An empirical formula for the 
binding energy consisting of contributions representing volume, surface, Coulomb and 
other effects was first proposed by von Weizsäcker in 1935.  Such a formula is useful 
because it not only allows one to calculate the mass of a nucleus, thereby eliminating the 
need for table of mass data, but also it leads to qualitative understanding of the essential 
features of nuclear binding.  More detailed theories exist,  for example, Bruecker et al., 
Physical Review 121, 255 (1961), but they are beyond the scope of our study. 
The empirical mass formula we consider here was derived on the basis of the 
liquid crop model of the nucleus.  The essential assumptions are: 

1.	 The nucleus is composed of incompressible matter, thus R ~ A1/3. 
2.	 The nuclear force is the same among neutrons and protons (excluding 
Coulomb interactions). 
3.	 The nuclear force saturates (meaning it is very short ranged). 

The empirical mass formula is usually given in terms of the binding energy,

11  Mev 

Since the fitting to experimental data is not perfect one can find several slightly different 
sets of coefficients in the literature.  The average accuracy of (11.1) is about 2 Mev 
except where strong shell effects are present.  One can add a term, ~ 1 to 2 Mev, to (11.1) 
to represent the shell effects, extra binding for nuclei with closed shells of neutrons or 
protons. 
A simple way to interpret (11.1) is to regard the first term as a first approximation 
to the binding energy.  That is to say, the binding energy is proportional to the volume of 
the nucleus or the mass number A.  This assumes every nucleon is like every other 
nucleon.  Of course this is an oversimplification, the remaining terms then can be 
regarded as corrections to this first approximation.  That is why the terms representing 
surface, Coulomb and asymmetry come in with negative signs, each one subtracting from 

2 

the volume effect.  It is quite understandable that the surface term should vary with A2/3, 
or R2.  The Coulomb term is also quite self-evident considering that Z(Z-1)/2 is the 
number of pairs that one can form from Z protons, and the 1/A1/3 factor comes from the 
1/R.  The asymmetry term in (11.1) is less obvious, so we digress to derive it. 
What we would like to estimate is the energy difference between an actual 
nucleus, where N > Z, and an ideal nucleus, where N = Z = A/2.  This is then the energy 
to transform a symmetric nucleus, in the sense of N = Z, to an asymmetric one, N > Z.  
For fixed N and Z, the number of protons that we need to transform into neutrons isν , 
with N=(A/2) + ν and Z = (A/2) - ν .  Thus, ν = (N – Z)/2.  Now consider a set of 
 
energy levels for the neutrons and another set for the protons, each one filled to a certain 
level.  To transform ν protons into neutrons the protons in question have to go into 
unoccupied energy levels above the last neutron.  This means the amount of energy 
involved is ν (the number of nucleons that have to be transformed) times ν∆ (energy 
change for each nucleon to be transformed) = ν 2 ∆ = ( N − Z ) 2 ∆ / 4 , where  ∆  is the 
spacing between energy levels (assumed to be the same for all the levels) .  To estimate 
∆ , we note that  ∆  ~ EF/A, where EF is the Fermi energy (see Figs. 9.7 and 9.8) which is 
known to be independent of A.  Thus  ∆  ~ 1/A, and we have the expression for the 
asymmetry term in (11.1).  
The magnitudes of the various contributions to the binding energy curve are 
depicted in Fig. 11.1.  The initial rise of B/A with A is seen to be due to the decreasing 
importance of the surface contribution as A increases.  The Coulomb repulsion effect 
grows in importance with A, causing a maximum in B/A at A ~ 60, and a subsequent 
decrease of B/A at larger A.  Except for the extreme ends of the mass number range the 
semi-empirical mass formula generally can give binding energies accurate to within 1%

of the experimental values [Evans, p. 382].  This means that atomic masses can be 
calculated correctly to roughly 1 part in 104.  However, there are conspicuous 
discrepancies in the neighborhood of magic nuclei.  Attempts have been made to take 
into account the nuclear shell effects by generalizing the mass formula.  In addition to 
what we have already mentioned, one can consider another term representing nuclear 
deformation [see Marmier and Sheldon, pp. 39, for references]. 
One can use the mass formula to determine the constant ro in the expression for 
the nuclear radius, R = roA1/3.  The radius appears in the coefficients av and as. In this 
way one obtains ro = 1.24 x 10-13 cm.

Notice that (11.2) is not an exact rearrangement of (11.1), certain small terms having 
been neglected.  What is important about (11.2) is that it shows that with A held constant 
the variation of M(A,Z) with Z is given by a parabola, as sketched below.  The minimum 

of this parabola occurs at the atomic number, which we label as ZA, of the stable nucleus 
for the given A.  This therefore represents a way of determining the stable nuclides. 
We can analyze (11.2) further by considering ∂M  / ∂Z 
= 0 .  This gives

(11.5) 

Notice that if we had considered only the volume, surface and Coulomb terms in B(A,Z), 
then we would have found instead of (11.5) the expression 

Z A  ≈ (M n  − M H  )c 2 A1 / 3

(11.6)

This is a very different result because for a stable nucleus with ZA = 20 the corresponding 
mass number given by (11.6) would be ~ 9,000, which is clearly unrealistic.  Fitting 
(11.5) to the experimental data gives  a c  / 4a a  = 0.0078, or aa ~ 20 – 23 Mev.  We see 
therefore the deviation of the stability line from N = Z = A/2 is the result of Coulomb 
effects, which favor ZA < A/2, becoming relatively more important than the asymmetry 
effects, which favor ZA = A/2. 
We can ask what happens when a nuclide is unstable because it is proton-rich.  
The answer is that a nucleus with too many protons for stability can emit a positron 
(positive electron e+ or β+ ) and thus convert a proton into a neutron.  In this process a 
neutrino (ν ) is also emitted.  An example of a positron decay is 

F 16 → 8 O 16  + β +  +ν 

9 

(11.7)

By the same token if a nucleus has too many neutrons, then it can emit an electron (e- or 
β− ) and an antineutrino ν , converting a neutron into a proton.  An electron decay for the 
isobar A = 16 is 

N 16 →  O 16  + β −  +ν 
8

(11.8)

A competing process with positron decay is electron capture (EC).  In this process an 
inner shell atomic electron is captured by the nucleus so the nuclear charge is reduced 
from Z to Z – 1.  (Note: Orbital electrons can spend a fraction of their time inside the 
nucleus.)  The atom as a whole would remain neutral but it is left in an excited state 
because a vacancy has been created in one of its inner shells. 
As far as atomic mass balance is concerned, the requirement for each process to 
be energetically allowed is: 

 

 

 

M(A, Z+1) > M(A,Z) + 2 me 

β+ - decay 

(11.9) 

6 

 

 

 

 

 

 

M(A,Z) > M(A, Z+1) 

β−  - decay 

(11.10) 

M(A, Z+1) > M(A,Z) 

EC 

(11.11) 

where M(A,Z) now denotes atomic mass.  Notice that EC is a less stringent condition for 
the nucleus to decrease its atomic number.  If the energy difference between initial and 
final states is less than twice the electron rest mass (1.02 Mev), the transition can take 
place via EC while it would be energetically forbidden via positron decay.  The reason 
for the appearance of the electron rest mass in (11.9) may be explained by looking at an 
energy balance in terms of nuclear mass M’(A,Z), which is related to the atomic mass by 
M(A,Z) = Zme + M’(A,Z), if we ignore the binding energy of the electrons in the atom.  
For β+ -decay the energy balance is 

M ' ( A, Z ) = M ' ( A, Z − 1) + me  +ν 

(11.12) 

which we can rewrite as 

Zme  + M ' ( A, Z ) = (Z − 1)me  + M ' ( A, Z − 1) + 2me  +ν 

(11.13) 

The LHS is just M(A,Z) while the RHS is at least M(A,Z-1) + 2me with the neutrino 
having a variable energy.  Thus one obtains (11.9).  Another way to look at this condition 
is that is that in addition to the positron emitted, the daughter nuclide also has to eject an 
electron (from an outer shell) in order to preserve charge neutrality. 
Having discussed how a nucleus can change its atomic number Z while preserving 
its mass number A, we can predict what transitions will occur as an unstable nuclide 
moves along the mass parabola toward the point of stability.  Since the pairing term δ 
vanishes for odd-A isobars, one has a single mass parabola in this case in contrast to two 
mass parabolas for the even-A isobars.  One might then expect that when A is odd there 
can be only one stable isobar.  This is generally true with two exceptions, at A = 113 and 
123.  In these two cases the discrepancies arise from small mass differences which cause 

7 

one of the isobars in each case to have exceptionally long half life.  In the case of even A 
there can be stable even-even isobars (three is the largest number found).  Since the odd-
odd isobars lie on the upper mass parabola, one would expect there should be no stable 
odd-odd nuclides.  Yet there are several exceptions, H2, Li6, B10 and N14.  One 
explanation is that there are rapid variations of the binding energy for the very light 
nuclides due to nuclear structure effects that are not taken into account in the sem(cid:173)
empirical mass formula.  For certain odd-odd nuclides both conditions for β+  and β− 
decays are satisfied, and indeed both decays do occur in the same nucleus.  Examples of 
odd- and even-A mass parabolas are shown in Fig. 11.2.
