2 The  amazing  properties  of  Si 

• two  types  of  carriers:  electrons  and  holes

– however,  can  make  good  electronic  devices  with 
just one, i.e.  MESFET (Metal-Semiconductor Field-
Eﬀect  Transistor),  or  HEMT  (High  Electron  Mo-
bility  Transistor) 
– but,  can’t  do  complementary  logic  (i.e.  CMOS) 
without  two

• carrier  concentrations  can  be  controlled  by  addition 
of  dopants 

– over many  orders  of magnitude  (about  20!) 
– and  in  short  length  scales  (nm  range)

type  and  n  type) 
– can make  very  low  resistance  ohmic  contacts

– can eﬀectively isolate devices by means of pn junc-
tions,  trenches  and  SOI

2.  Many  considerations  in  circuit  design:

• multiple  performance  specs: 
–  in  analog  systems:  gain,  bandwidth,  power  con-
sumption,  swing,  noise,  etc. 
–  in  digital  systems:  propagation  delay,  power,  ease 
of  logic  synthesis,  noise,  etc. 
• need to be immune to temperature  variations  and de-
vice parameter  variations  (i.e.:  diﬀerential  ampliﬁer) 
• must choose suitable technology:  CMOS, BJT, CBJT, 
BiCMOS,  etc. 
• must  avoid  costly  components  (i.e.:  resistors,  capac-
itors) 

3.  Trade-oﬀs:

• gain-bandwidth  trade-oﬀ  in ampliﬁers (i.e.:  Miller ef-
fect) 
• performance-power  trade-oﬀ  (i.e.:  delay  in  logic  cir-
cuits,  gain  in  ampliﬁers) 
• performance-cost  trade-oﬀ  (cost=design  complexity, 
Si  area, more  aggressive  technology) 
• accuracy-complexity  trade-oﬀ  in modeling

2 Exciting  times  ahead  in  circuit  design  too:

• Numbers  of  transistors  available  outstrips  ability  to 
design  by 3  to  1! 
• Operational  frequency of logic, analog,  and communi-
cations  circuits  increasing  very  fast. 
• Operational  voltage  shrinking  quickly.

• New  device  technologies:  GaAs  HEMT,  InP  HBT, 
GaN HEMT,  etc
