Electronic structure of Si atom:
• 10 core electrons (tightly bound)
• 4 valence electrons (loosely bound, responsible for most
chemical properties)

Other semiconductors:
• Ge, C (diamond form), SiGe
• GaAs, InP, InGaAs, InGaAsP, ZnSe, CdTe
(on average, 4 valence electrons per atom)

3sp tetrahedral bond

• Silicon is a crystalline material:
– long range atomic arrangement
• Diamond lattice:
– atoms tetrahedrally bonded by sharing valence elec-
trons (covalent bonding)
• Each atom shares 8 electrons:
– low energy and stable situation
• Si atomic density: 5 × 1022 cm−3

Lecture 2-5

Simple ”ﬂattened” model of Si crystal:

4 valence electrons ( – 4 q ),
contributed by each ion 

silicon ion (+ 4 q)

two electrons in bond

At 0K:
• all bonds satisﬁed → all valence electrons engaged in
bonding
• no ”free” electrons

At ﬁnite temperature:

mobile electron

incomplete bond (mobile hole)

• ﬁnite thermal energy
• some bonds are broken
• ”free” electrons (mobile negative charge, −1.6×10−19 C )
• ”free” holes (mobile positive charge, 1.6 × 10−19 C )

”Free” electrons and holes are called carriers:
• mobile charged particles

Beware: picture is misleading!
• electrons and holes in semiconductors are ”fuzzier”:
they span many atomic sites.

Lecture 2-7

A few deﬁnitions:
• in 6.012, ”electron” means free electron
• not concerned with bonding electrons or core electrons
• deﬁne:
n ≡ (free) electron concentration [cm−3 ]
p ≡ hole concentration [cm−3 ]

Lecture 2-8

2. Generation and Recombination

Generation = break up of covalent bond to form elec-
tron and hole
• requires energy from thermal or optical sources (or
other external sources)
• generation rate: G = Gth + Gopt + ... [cm−3 · s−1]
• in general, atomic density (cid:29) n, p ⇒
G 6= f (n, p)
– supply of breakable bonds virtually inexhaustible

Recombination = formation of bond by bringing to-
gether electron and hole
• releases energy in thermal or optical form
• recombination rate: R [cm−3 · s−1 ]
• a recombination event requires 1 electron + 1 hole ⇒
R ∝ n · p

Generation and recombination most likely at surfaces where
periodic crystalline structure is broken.

3. Thermal equilibrium

Thermal equilibrium =
steady state + absence of external energy sources

hυ

δ<θ>
δt

=0

• Generation rate in thermal equilibrium: Go = f (T )
• Recombination rate in thermal equilibrium: Ro ∝ no ·po

In thermal equilibrium:
Go = Ro ⇒ nopo = f (T ) ≡ n2
i (T )

Important consequence:

In thermal equilibrium and for a given semiconduc-
tor, np product is a constant that depends only on
temperature!

Electron-hole formation can be seen as chemical reaction:

similar to water decomposition reaction:

H2O *) H + + OH

Law-of-mass action relates concentration of reactants
and reaction products. For water:
[H +][OH − ]
[H2O]

Then:

Hence:

4. Intrinsic semiconductor

Question: In a perfectly pure semiconductor in thermal
equilibrium at ﬁnite temperature, how many electrons
and holes are there?

Since when a bond breaks, an electron and a hole are
produced:

no = po

nopo = n2
i

Also:

Then:

no = po = ni
ni ≡ intrinsic carrier concentration [cm−3 ]
In Si at 300 K (”room temperature”): ni ' 1× 1010 cm−3
ni very strong function of temperature: T ↑ → ni ↑

Note: an intrinsic semiconductor need not be perfectly
pure [see next]

introduction of foreign atoms to engineer
semiconductor electrical properties

Summary
• In a semiconductor, there are two types of ”carriers”:
electrons and holes
• In thermal equilibrium and for a given semiconductor

• For Si at room temperature:

• Carrier concentrations can be engineered by addition
of ”dopants” (selected foreign atoms):
