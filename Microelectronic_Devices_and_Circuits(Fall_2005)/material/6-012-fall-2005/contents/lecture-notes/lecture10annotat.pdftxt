Key  questions 
• How  does  the MOSFET work  in  saturation?

• Does  the  pinch-oﬀ  point  represent  a  block  to  current 
ﬂow? 
• How  come  the  MOSFET  current  still  increases  a  bit 
with  VDS  in  saturation? 
• How  does  the  application  of  a  back  bias  aﬀect  the 
MOSFET  I-V  characteristics?

2 What  happens when VDS  = VGS  − VT ? 
Charge  control  relation  at  drain-end  of  channel: 
Qn(L) = −Cox(VGS  − VDS  − VT ) = 0

No  inversion  layer  at  end  of  channel??!!  ⇒ Pinch-oﬀ
Pinch-oﬀ
At  pinch-oﬀ: 
• charge  control  equation  inaccurate  around  VT 
• electron  concentration  small  but  not  zero 
• electrons move  fast  because  electric  ﬁeld  is  very high

• dominant  electrostatic  feature:  acceptor  charge 
• there  is  no  barrier  to  electron  ﬂow  (on  the  contrary!)

semiconductor:

How  does  VT  change with  VBS ?

In VT  formula  change −2φp  to −2φp  − VBS :

� 
GB (VBS ) = VF B  − 2φp  − VBS  + γ  (−2φp  − VBS ) 
VT

In MOSFETs,  interested  in VT  between  gate  and  source: 
VGB  = VGS  − VBS  ⇒  VT
GS  − VBS 
GB  = VT

Then: 

V GS  = V GB 
T  + VBS 
T

And: 
� 
V GS (VBS ) = VF B  − 2φp  + γ  (−2φp  − VBS ) ≡ VT (VBS )
T 

In  the  context  of  the  MOSFET,  VT  is  always  deﬁned  in 
terms  of  gate-to-source  voltage.

Key  conclusions

• MOSFET  in  saturation  (VDS  ≥  VDS sat):  pinch-oﬀ 
point  at  drain-end  of  channel 

– electron  concentration  small,  but

– electrons move  very  fast; 
– pinch-oﬀ point does not represent a barrier to elec-
tron  ﬂow 
• In  saturation,  ID  saturates: 
µnCox(VGS  − VT )2 
W 
IDsat  = 
2L

• But...,  due  to  channel-length  modulation,  IDsat  in-
creases  slightly  with  VDS 
• Application  of  back  bias  shifts VT  (back-gate  eﬀect)
