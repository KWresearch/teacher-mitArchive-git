Key  questions

• What  are  the  key  ﬁgures  of merit  of  an  ampliﬁer?

• How  can  one  make  a  voltage  ampliﬁer  with  a  single 
MOSFET  and  a  resistor? 
• How  can  this  ampliﬁer  be  improved?

Features  of  ampliﬁer: 
• Output  signal  is  faithful  replica  of  input  signal  but 
ampliﬁed  in magnitude. 
• Active  device  is  at  the  heart  of  ampliﬁer.

• Need  linear  transfer  characteristics  for  distortion 
not  to  be  introduced.

• Transfer  characteristics  linear  over  limited  range  of 
voltages:  ampliﬁer  saturation. 
• Ampliﬁer  saturation  limits  signal  swing.

• Signal  swing  also  depends  on  choice  of  bias  point, Q 
(also  called  quiescent  point  or  operating  point). 

Other  features  desired  in  ampliﬁers: 
• Low  power  consumption. 
• Wide  frequency  response  [will  discuss  in a  few days].

• Robust  to  process  and  temperature  variations. 
• Inexpensive:  must  minimize  use  of  unusual  compo-
nents, must  be  small  (in  Si  area)

Consider  it  ﬁrst  unloaded  by RL .  How  does  it work? 
• VGG, RD  and W/L of MOSFET selected to bias tran-
sistor  in  saturation  and  obtain  desired  output  bias 
point  (i.e.  VOU T  = 0). 
• vGS  ↑ ⇒i D  ↑ ⇒ iR  ↑ ⇒v out  ↓ 
• Av  =  vout  < 0;  output  out  of  phase  from  input,  but  if 
ampliﬁer  well  designed,  |Av | > 1.

Then:

• Bias  point  not  aﬀected  because  selected  VOU T  = 0. 
• Signal  swing: 
– Upswing  limited  by  resistive  divider: 
RL 
vout,max  = VDD RL  + RD 
– Downswing  not  aﬀected  by  loading 
• Voltage  gain: 
–  input  loading  (RS ):  no  eﬀect  because  gate  does 
not  draw  current; 
– output  loading  (RL ):  RL  detracts  from  voltage 
gain  because  it  draws  current.

2 Design  issues  of  common-source  ampliﬁer  (unloaded): 

Examine  bias  dependence: 
|Avo | = gm(ro//RD ) (cid:5) gmRD 
Rewrite  |Avo | in  the  following  way: 
� � � �
�  W 
|Avo | (cid:5) gmRD  = 2  µnCoxID 
VDD 
� 
L 
ID 
Then,  to  get  high  |Avo |: 
⇒  VDD  ↑ 
⇒  ID  ↓ 
Both  approaches  imply ⇒ RD  =  VDD  ↑
ID 
Consequences  of  high RD : 
• large  RD  consumes  a  lot  of  Si  real  state 
• large  RD  eventually  compromises  frequency  response 

∝ √ 
VDD
ID 

Also,  it would  be  nice  not  to  use  any  resistors  at  all! 
⇒ Need better  circuit.

Key  conclusions

• Figures  of merit  of  an  ampliﬁer: 
– gain 
–  signal  swing 
– power  consumption 
–  frequency  response 
–  robustness  to  process  and  temperature  variations 
• Common-source ampliﬁer with resistive supply:  trade-

oﬀ  between  gain  and  cost  and  frequency  response.

• Trade-oﬀ  resolved  by  using  common-source  ampliﬁer 
with  current  source  supply. 
• Two-port network computation of voltage gain,  input 
resistance  and  output  resistance  of  ampliﬁer.
