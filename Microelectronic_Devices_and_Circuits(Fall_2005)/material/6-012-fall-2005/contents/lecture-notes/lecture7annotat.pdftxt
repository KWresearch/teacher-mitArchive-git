Key  questions

• What is the big deal about the metal-oxide-semiconductor 
structure? 
• What do the electrostatics  of the MOS structure  look 
like  at  zero  bias? 
• How  do  the  electrostatics  of  the  MOS  structure  get

modiﬁed  if  a  voltage  is  applied  across  its  terminals?

• Metal:  does not tolerate volume charge ⇒ charge can 
only  exist  at  its  surface 
• Oxide:  insulator ⇒ no volume charge (no free carriers, 
no  dopants) 
• Semiconductor:  can  have volume  charge  (SCR)


Thermal  equilibrium  can’t  be  established  through  oxide; 
need  wire  to  allow  transfer  of  charge  between  metal  and 
semiconductor. 
MOS  structure:  sandwich  of  dissimilar  materials ⇒  car-
rier transfer ⇒ space-charge region at zero bias ⇒ built-in 
potential

How  is  potential  diﬀerence  accommodated?


Potential  can  drop  in: 
•  gate  contact 
• n+-polysilicon  gate

•  oxide

•  semiconductor  SCR 
•  semiconductor  QNR

•  semiconductor  contact

Key  conclusions

• Charge  redistribution  in MOS  structure  at  zero  bias:

– SCR  in  semiconductor 
– built-in  potential  across MOS  structure. 
• In most cases, can do depletion approximation in semi-
conductor  SCR. 
• Application of voltage modulates depletion region width 
in  semiconductor.  No  current  ﬂows.
