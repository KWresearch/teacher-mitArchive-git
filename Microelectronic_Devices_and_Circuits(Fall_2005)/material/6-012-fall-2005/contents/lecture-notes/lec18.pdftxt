Key questions
• What other regimes of operation are there for the
BJT?
• What is unique about each regime?
• How do equivalent circuit models for the BJT look
like?

• forward active: device has good isolation and high
gain; most useful regime;
• saturation: device has no isolation and is ﬂooded with
minority carriers ⇒ takes time to get out of satura-
tion; avoid
• reverse: poor gain; not useful;
• cut-oﬀ: negligible current: nearly an open circuit;
useful.

• βF hard to control tightly ⇒ circuit design techniques
required to be insensitive to variations in βF .

• IC and IE can have either sign, depending on relative
magnitude of VBE and VBC , and βF and βR.
• In saturation, collector and base ﬂooded with excess
minority carriers ⇒ takes lots of time to get transistor
out of saturation.
