Small-signal device modeling

In many applications, interested in response of device to
a smal l-signal applied on top of bias:

VDS

vbs
VBS

-

vgs
VGS

Key points:
• Small-signal is smal l
⇒ response of non-linear components becomes linear
• Can separate response of MOSFET to bias and small
signal.
• Since response is linear, superposition can be used
⇒ eﬀects of diﬀerent small signals are independent
from each other
