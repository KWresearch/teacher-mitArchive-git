•  A  well  controlled   voltage 
•  voltage  does  not  depend  on  current  drawn  from  source 
(low   internal   resistance).

•  Advantages: 
–  IRE F   set  by  value  of  resistor. 
•  Disadvantages: 
–  VDD   also  aﬀects  IRE F . 
–  VT  and   R  are  function  of  temperature  ⇒  IRE F (T ). 

In  real  world,  more   sophisticated  circuits  used  to  generate  
IRE F  that  are  VDD   and  T  independent.

Key  conclusions

•  Voltage  source  easily  synthesized  from   current   source 
using  MOSFET  in   diode  conﬁguration. 
•  Current  source   easily  synthesized  from  current  source 
using  current  mirror  circuit. 
•  Multiple  current  sources  and  sinks  with  diﬀerent  mag­
nitudes  of   current  can  be  synthesized  from   a  single 
current  source. 
•  Voltage  and   current  sources  rely  on  availability  of   well 
”matched”  transistors  in  IC   technology.
