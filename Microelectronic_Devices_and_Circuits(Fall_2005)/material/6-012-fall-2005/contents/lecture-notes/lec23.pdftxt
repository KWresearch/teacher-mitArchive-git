4.  Miller  eﬀect 

In  common­source   ampliﬁer,  Cgd   looks  much  bigger  than 
it  really  is. 

Consider  simple   voltage­gain  stage: 

iin 

C 

+ 
vin 

-

-
+

Avvin 

+ 
vout

-

What  is  the  input  impedance? 
iin  = (vin  − vout)jωC  

But 

Then: 

vout  =  −Av vin 

iin  =  vin(1  +  Av )C 

6.012  ­ Microelectronic   Devices   and  Circuits  ­ Fall   2005 

Lecture  23­16 

or 

Zin  =

vin 
iin 

=  

1 
jω(1  +  Av )C 

From   input,  C ,  looks  much  bigger   than  it  really  is.  This 
is  called  the  Mil ler  eﬀect. 

When   a   capacitor  is  located  across  nodes  where  there  is 
voltage  gain,  its  eﬀect  on  bandwidth  is  ampliﬁed  by  the  
voltage  gain  ⇒  Mil ler  capacitance: 

CM iller  =  C (1  +   Av ) 

Why?  
vin  ↑ ⇒  

vout   =

−Av vin  ↓↓   ⇒   (vin  − vout)  ↑↑   ⇒   iin  ↑↑ 

In  ampliﬁer  stages   with  voltage  gain,  it  is  critical  to  have 
small  capacitance  across  voltage  gain  nodes. 

As  a  result  of   the  Miller  eﬀect,  there  is  a  fundamental 
gain­bandwidth  tradeoﬀ  in  ampliﬁers.

Key  conclusions

•  fT  (short­circuit  current­gain   cut­oﬀ  frequency):  ﬁg­
ure  of  merit  to  assess  intrinsic  frequency  response  of 
transistors. 
•  In  MOSFET,  to  ﬁrst  order, 

ft  = 

1 
2πτt 

where  τt  is  transit  time  of  electrons  through  channel. 
•  In  common­source  ampliﬁer,  voltage  gain  rolls  oﬀ  at 
high  frequency  because   Cgs   and  Cgd   short  out  input 
and  Cdb  shorts   out  output. 
•  In  common­source  ampliﬁer,  eﬀect  of  Cgd   on  band­
width  is  magniﬁed  by  ampliﬁer   voltage  gain. 
•  Mil ler  eﬀect:  eﬀect  of  capacitance  across  voltage  gain 
nodes   is  magniﬁed   by  voltage  gain 
⇒  trade­oﬀ   between   gain  and  bandwidth.
