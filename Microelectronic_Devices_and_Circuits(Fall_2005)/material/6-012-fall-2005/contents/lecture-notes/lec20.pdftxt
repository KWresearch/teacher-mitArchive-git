Key  questions 
•  What  other  ampliﬁer  stages  can  one  build  with  a  sin­
gle  MOSFET  and  a  current   source? 
•  What  is  the  uniqueness  of  these  other   stages?

How  does   it  work? 
• since   source   is   signal   input  terminal,  body  cannot  be 
tied  up  to   source (Cdb  is  signiﬁcant) 
• iSU P ,  IB I AS ,  and   W/L   selected  to  bias  MOSFET  in 
saturation,  obtain   desired  output   bias  point,  and  de­
sired   output  swing 
• iS  ↑ ⇒   iD  ↓ ⇒  
iOU T   ↓
• no  current   gain:  is  =

�  Bias:  select  ISU P ,  IB I AS ,  and  W/L   to  get  proper  qui­
escent  IOU T   and  keep  MOSFET  in  saturation.

ISU P   +  IOU T   +  IB I AS   = 0  
⇒ 

VOU T   = 0.  

Select  bias  so   that  IOU T   = 0  

Assume  MOSFET   in  saturation  (no  channel  modulation): 

ID  = 

W 
2L

µnCox (VGS  − VT )2  =  ISU P   =  −IB I AS  

but  VT  depends  on  VBS : 
� 
� 
VT  =  VT o   +  γn( −2φp  − VBS   − −2φp ) 

Must  solve  these  two  equations  iteratively  to   get   VS .

Key  conclusions


Diﬀerent  MOSFET  stages  designed  to  accomplish  diﬀer­
ent  goals: 
•	 Common­source  stage:

–	 large   voltage   gain  and  transconductance,  high  in­
put  resistance,  large  output  resistance 
–	 excellent  transconductance  ampliﬁer,  reasonable  volt­
age  ampliﬁer 
•	 Common­drain  stage:

–	 no  voltage  gain,  but  high  input  resistance  and  low 
output  resistance 
–	 good  voltage  buﬀer 
•	 Common­gate  stage:

–	 no  current  gain,  but  low   input  resistance  and  high 
output  resistance 
–	 good  current  buﬀer
