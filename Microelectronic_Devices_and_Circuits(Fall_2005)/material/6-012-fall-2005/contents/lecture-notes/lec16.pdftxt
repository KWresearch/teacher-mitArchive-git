Lecture 16-2

Key questions
• How does a pn diode look like from a small-signal
point of view?
• What are the leading dependences of the small-signal
elements?
• In addition to the junction capacitance, are there any
other capacitive eﬀects in a pn diode?

• potential diﬀerence across SCR reduced by V ⇒ mi-
nority carrier injection in QNR’s
• minority carrier diﬀusion through QNR’s
• minority carrier recombination at surface of QNR’s
• large supply of carriers available for injection
⇒ I ∝ eqV /kT

Physics of reverse bias:
• potential diﬀerence across SCR increased by V
⇒ minority carrier extraction from QNR’s
• minority carrier diﬀusion through QNR’s
• minority carrier generation at surface of QNR’s
• very small supply of carriers available for extraction
⇒ I saturates to small value
