Key  questions 
•  Is  there   a  fast  way   to  assess  the  frequency  response  of 
an  ampliﬁer? 
•  Do  all  ampliﬁers   suﬀer   from  the  Miller  eﬀect?

1.  Open­Circuit  Time­Constant   Technique 

Simple  technique  to   estimate  bandwidth  of  an  ampliﬁer. 

Method   works   well  if  ampliﬁer  transfer  function  has: 
•  a  dominant  pole   that  dominates  the  bandwidth 
•  no  zeroes,  or  zeroes  at  frequencies  much  higher  than  
that  of  dominant  pole 

Transfer  function   of  form: 

Vout

It  can   be  shown  (see  Gray  &   Meyer,  3rd  ed.,  p.  502)  that

b1  =  �  τi  =  �  RT iCi

where: 

τi  is  open­circuit  time  constant  for  capacitor  Ci 

RT i   is  Thevenin  resistance  across  Ci 
(with  all  other  capacitors  open­circuited)

Summary  of  open­circuit  time  constant  technique: 

1.   shut­oﬀ  all  independent  sources 

2.   compute   Thevenin   resistance  RT i   seen  by each  Ci  with 
all  other  C ’s  open 

3.   compute   open­circuit  time  constant   for  Ci  as 

τi  =  RT iCi

No  capacitor  in   Miller   position  →  no  Miller­like  term. 

Simplify: 
•  In  a  current  ampliﬁer,  RS  � Rin:

RT 1  =  RS //Rin  � Rin  �
•  At  output: 
RT 2  =  RL//Rout   =  RL//roc//{ro [1+RS (gm+gmb+

If  RL  is   not  too  high,  bandwidth  can  be  rather  high  (and 
approach   ωT ).

Key  conclusions

•  Open­circuit  time­constant  technique:  simple  and  pow­
erful  method   to  estimate   bandwidth  of   ampliﬁers. 
•  Common­gate   ampliﬁer: 
–  no  capacitor  in  Miller  position  ⇒  no  Miller  eﬀect 
–  if  RL  is  not  too  high,  CG  amp  has  high  bandwidth 
•  RS , RL  aﬀect  bandwidth  of   ampliﬁer
