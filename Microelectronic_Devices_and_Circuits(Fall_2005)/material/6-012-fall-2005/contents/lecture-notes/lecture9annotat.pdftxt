Want to understand MOSFET operation as a function of:

• gate-to-source  voltage  (gate  height  over  source  water 
level) 
• drain-to-source voltage (water level diﬀerence between 
reservoirs) 

Initially  consider  source  tied  up  to  body  (substrate  or 
back).

2 General  expression  of  channel  current 

Current  can  only  ﬂow  in 

y -direction: 

Iy  = W Qn(y )vy (y ) 

Drain terminal current is equal to minus channel current:

ID  = −W Qn(y )vy (y ) 

6.012  - Microelectronic Devices  and  Circuits  - Fall  2005 

Lecture  9-11


ID  = −W Qn(y )vy (y ) 

Rewrite  in  terms  of  voltage  at  channel  location  y ,  Vc(y ): 
• If  electric  ﬁeld  is  not  too  big: 
vy (y ) (cid:4) −µnEy (y ) = µn  dy 
dVc (y )

For 

)  use  charge-control  relation  at  location 
Qn(y ) = −Cox [
VGS  − Vc(y ) − VT ] 
for  VGS  − Vc(y ) ≥ VT . 
All  together: 
ID  = W µnCox (VGS  − Vc (y ) − VT )  dy 
dVc(y ) 
Simple linear ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation with one un-
known,  the  channel  voltage  Vc(y ).

Solve by  separating  variables:

IDdy = W µnCox (VGS  − Vc  − VT )dVc 

Integrate  along  the  channel  in  the  linear  regime: 

-for  y

Vc

-for  y = L,  Vc(L) = VDS

Key  conclusions 
• The MOSFET  is  a  ﬁeld-eﬀect  transistor:

–  the  amount  of  charge  in  the  inversion  layer  is  con-
trolled  by  the  ﬁeld-eﬀect  action  of  the  gate 
–  the  charge  in  the  inversion  layer  is mobile ⇒  con-
duction  possible  between  source  and  drain 
• In  the  linear  regime: 
– VGS  ↑⇒ ID  ↑:  more  electrons  in  the  channel 
– VDS  ↑⇒ ID  ↑:  stronger  ﬁeld  pulling  electrons  out 
of  the  source 
• Channel debiasing:  inversion layer ”thins down” from 
source to drain ⇒ current saturation as VDS  approaches: 
VDS sat  = VGS  − VT
