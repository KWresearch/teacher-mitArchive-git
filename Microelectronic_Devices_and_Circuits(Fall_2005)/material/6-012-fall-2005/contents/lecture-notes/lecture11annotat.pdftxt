Key  questions

• What  is  the  topology  of  a  small-signal  equivalent  cir-
cuit model  of  the MOSFET? 
• What  are  the  key  dependencies  of  the  leading  model 
elements  in  saturation?

Small-signal  device  modeling


In many  applications,  interested  in  response  of  device  to 
a  smal l-signal  applied  on  top  of  bias: 

ID+id 

+
-

vbs 
VBS 

+ 
vds 
-

VDS 

+ 
vgs 
-
VGS 

Key  points: 
• Small-signal  is  smal l 
⇒  response  of non-linear  components  becomes  linear 
• Can  separate  response of MOSFET to bias and small 
signal. 
• Since  response  is  linear,  superposition  can  be used

⇒  eﬀects  of  diﬀerent  small  signals  are  independent 
from  each  other

Plan  for  development  of  capacitance model: 
• Start  with Cgs,i 
– compute  gate  charge QG  = −(QN  + QB ) 
– compute  how QG  changes with  VGS 
• Add  pn  junction  capacitances
