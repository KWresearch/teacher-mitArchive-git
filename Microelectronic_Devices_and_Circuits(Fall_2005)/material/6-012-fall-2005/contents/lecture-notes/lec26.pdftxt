•	 two  types  of  carriers:  electrons  and  holes  
–	 however,  can  make  good  electronic  devices  with 
just  one,  i.e.  MESFET  (Metal­Semiconductor  Field­
Eﬀect  Transistor),  or  HEMT   (High  Electron  Mo­
bility Transistor) 
–	 but,  can’t  do  complementary  logic  (i.e.  CMOS)  
without two

•  carrier  concentrations  can  be  controlled  by  addition 
of   dopants 

–  over  many  orders  of  magnitude  (about  20!) 
–  and   in   short  length  scales  (nm  range)

2.  Many  considerations  in  circuit  design: 
•	 multiple  performance  specs: 
–	 in   analog  systems:  gain,  bandwidth,  power  con­
sumption,  swing,  noise,  etc. 
–	 in   digital  systems:  propagation  delay,  power,  ease  
of  logic  synthesis,  noise,  etc. 
•  need   to  be  immune  to  temperature  variations  and  de­
vice  parameter  variations  (i.e.:  diﬀerential  ampliﬁer)  
•  must  choose   suitable  technology:  CMOS,   BJT,  CBJT, 
BiCMOS,  etc. 
•  must  avoid   costly  components  (i.e.:  resistors,  capac­
itors) 

3.   Trade­oﬀs: 
•  gain­bandwidth   trade­oﬀ  in  ampliﬁers  (i.e.:  Miller  ef­
fect) 
•  performance­power  trade­oﬀ (i.e.:  delay  in  logic  cir­
cuits,  gain   in  ampliﬁers) 
•  performance­cost  trade­oﬀ  (cost=design  complexity, 
Si  area,  more   aggressive  technology) 
•	 accuracy­complexity  trade­oﬀ  in  modeling

Lecture  26­19 

�  Exciting   times   ahead  in  circuit  design  too: 
•  Numbers   of  transistors  available  outstrips  ability   to 
design   by  3   to  1! 
•  Operational  frequency  of  logic,  analog,  and  communi­
cations   circuits   increasing  very  fast. 
•  Operational  voltage  shrinking  quickly. 
•  New  device  technologies:  GaAs  HEMT,  InP  HBT, 
GaN  HEMT,  etc
