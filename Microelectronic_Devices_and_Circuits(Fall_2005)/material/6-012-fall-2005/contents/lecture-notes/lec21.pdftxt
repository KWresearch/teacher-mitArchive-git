Key  questions

• How  can  one  build  a wide  range  of  high-performance 
ampliﬁers using the single-transistor  stages studied so 
far? 
• What  are  the  most  important  considerations  when 
assembling mulstistage  ampliﬁers: 

–  regarding  interstage  loading?

–  regarding  interstage  biasing?

Lecture  21-3 

1.  Introduction 

Ampliﬁer  requirements  are  often  demanding: 
• must adapt to speciﬁc kinds of signal source and load,

• must  deliver  suﬃcient  gain 

Single-transistor  ampliﬁer stages are very limited  in what 
they  can  accomplish ⇒ multistage  ampliﬁer.

Issues: 
• What  amplifying  stages  should  be  used  and  in  what 
order? 
• What  devices  should  be  used, BJT  or MOSFET?

• How  is  biasing  to  be  done?

2 Avo (CE ) > Avo (C S )  because  ro(BJ T ) > ro(M OSF E T )

and  gm (BJ T ) > gm(M OSF E T )  but...

CS  stage  is  best  ﬁrst  stage,  since Rin  = ∞.

Trouble  is  interstage  loading  degrades  gain: 
Rout1  = ro1//roc1  (cid:4) Rin2  = rπ2 

Voltage  divider  between  stages:

Additional  gain  provided  by CE  stage  more  than  lost  in 
interstage  loading.

Interstage  loading: 

Rout2  = ro2//roc2 , Rin3  = rπ3  + β3(ro3//roc3//RL) 

Then,  interstage  loss: 

Rin3 
Rout2  + Rin3 

=


rπ3  + β3(ro3//roc3//RL ) 
ro2//roc2  + rπ3  + β3(ro3//roc3//RL) 

better than trying to use a CE stage, but still pretty bad. 

Beneﬁt  is  that  Rout  has  improved: 

Rout  = Rout3  =

Since,  in  general,  gm (BJ T )  > gm (M OSF E T ),  Rout 
could  be  better  than  CD  output  stage  if  ro2//roc2  is  not 
too  large.  Otherwise,  CD  stage  output  is  better.

4.  BiCMOS  current  buﬀer

• Unity  current  gain 
• very  low Rin 
• very high Rout

RL 

• Aio  = −1 
• Rin  =  1 
gm 
• Rout  = roc//{ro [1 + gm(rπ //RS )]} 
Note  that  if RS  is  not  too  low,  Rout  (cid:3) roc//(β ro). 
Can  we  further  increase  Rout  by  adding  a  second  CB 
stage?

Now

Rout  = Rout2  = roc2//{ro2 [1 + gm2 (rπ2//Rout1 )]} 
Plugging  in Rout1  (cid:3) roc1//(β1ro1 ), 
Rout  = roc2//{ro2 [1 + gm2 (rπ2//roc1//β1ro1)]} 
But,  since  rπ2  (cid:5) roc1//(β1ro1),  then 
Rout  (cid:3) roc2//[ro2 (1 + gm2rπ2 )] (cid:3) roc2//(β2ro2 ) 

Did  not  improve  anything!  The  base  current  limits  the 
number  of CB  stages  that  improve  Rout  to  just  one. 

Since CG stage has no gate current, cascade it behind CB 
stage.

Rout  = roc2//[ro2gm2 (roc1//β1ro1 )] 

Now Rout  has  improved by about  gm2ro2 , but only  to  the 
extent  that  roc2  is  high  enough...

5.  Coupling  ampliﬁer  stages


2 Capacitive  coupling 

Capacitors  of  large  enough  value  behave  as AC  short,  so

signal goes through but bias is independent for each stage.


Example,  CD-CC  voltage  buﬀer: 

5.0 V 

5.0 V

4.0 V

2.5 V 

ISUP1 

3.2 V 

ISUP2 

2.5 V

Assumes VBE
VGS

 = 0.7 V 
= 1.5 V

• Advantages: 
– can  select  bias  point  for  optimum  operation 
– can  select  bias  point  close  to  middle  of  rails  for 
maximum  signal  swing 
• Disadvantages: 

–  to  approximate  AC  short,  need  large  capacitors 
that  consume  signiﬁcant  area 

6.012  - Microelectronic Devices  and  Circuits  - Fall  2005 

Lecture  21-14 

2 Direct  coupling:  share  bias  points  across  stages.

4.7 V

ISUP1 

ISUP2 

2.5 V

Assumes VBE
= 1.5 V
VGS

• Advantages: 
– no  capacitors:  compact 
• Disadvantages: 
– bias  point  shared:  constrains  design 

– bias  shifts  from  stage  to  stage  and  can  stray  too 
far  from  center  of  range

Key  conclusions

• To  achieve ampliﬁer  design goals,  several  stages often 
needed. 
• In  multistage  ampliﬁers,  diﬀerent  stages  used  to  ac-
complish  diﬀerent  goals: 

– voltage  gain:  common-source,  common  emitter 

– voltage  buﬀer:  common-drain,  common  collector

– current  buﬀer:  common-gate,  common  base 
• In  multistage  ampliﬁers  must  pay  attention  to  inter-
stage  loading  to  avoid  unnecessary  losses. 
• In  direct-coupled  ampliﬁers,  bias  is  shared  between 
adjoining  stages: 

– must  select  compromise  bias, 
– must pay attention to bias shift from stage to stage.
