Motivation: 
• Processor  speeds  ↑ 
• Traﬃc  volume  ↑ ⇒data  rates  ↑ 
• More bandwidth available at higher frequencies in the

• Cdb  enters  fH  but  not  fT 
S 
• presence  of  |Av,LF | in  denominator 

2 To  improve  bandwidth, 
• Cgs , Cgd , Cdb  ↓ ⇒ small  transistor with  low parasitics 
• |Av,LF | ↓⇒ don’t want more  gain  than  really  needed 

but... 

why  is  it  that  eﬀect  of  Cgd  on  fH  appears  to  being  am-
pliﬁed  by 1 + |Av,LF |??!!

4.  Miller  eﬀect


In  common-source  ampliﬁer,  Cgd  looks much bigger  than 
it  really  is. 

Consider  simple  voltage-gain  stage:


iin 

C 

+ 
vin 

-

-
+

Avvin 

+ 
vout

-

What  is  the  input  impedance? 
iin  = (vin  − vout)jωC 

But 

Then: 

vout  = −Av vin 

iin  = vin(1 + Av )C 

6.012  - Microelectronic Devices  and  Circuits  - Fall  2005 

Lecture  23-16 

or 

Zin  =

vin 
iin 

= 

1 
jω(1 + Av )C 

From  input,  C ,  looks much  bigger  than  it  really  is.  This 
is  called  the Mil ler  eﬀect. 

When  a  capacitor  is  located  across  nodes  where  there  is 
voltage  gain,  its  eﬀect  on  bandwidth  is  ampliﬁed  by  the 
voltage  gain ⇒ Mil 
Mil ler  c pacitance: 
:
ler ca acitance
p

CM iller  = C (1 + Av ) 

Why? 
vin  ↑ ⇒  vout  = −Av vin  ↓↓ ⇒ (vin  − vout) ↑↑ ⇒ iin  ↑↑ 
In ampliﬁer  stages with  voltage gain,  it  is critical  to have 
small  capacitance  across  voltage  gain  nodes.

As  a  result  of  the  Miller  eﬀect,  there  is  a

gain-bandwidth  tradeoﬀ  in ampliﬁers.

Key  conclusions

• fT  (short-circuit current-gain cut-oﬀ frequency):  ﬁg-
ure  of  merit  to  assess  intrinsic  frequency  response  of 
transistors. 
• In MOSFET,  to  ﬁrst  order, 

ft  = 

1 
2πτt 
where τt  is transit  time of electrons  through  channel. 
• In  common-source  ampliﬁer,  voltage  gain  rolls  oﬀ  at 
high  frequency  because  Cgs  and  Cgd  short  out  input 
and Cdb  shorts  out  output. 
• In  common-source  ampliﬁer,  eﬀect  of  Cgd  on  band-
width  is magniﬁed  by ampliﬁer  voltage  gain. 
• Mil ler eﬀect:  eﬀect of capacitance across voltage gain 
nodes  is magniﬁed  by voltage  gain 
⇒  trade-oﬀ  between  gain  and  bandwidth.
