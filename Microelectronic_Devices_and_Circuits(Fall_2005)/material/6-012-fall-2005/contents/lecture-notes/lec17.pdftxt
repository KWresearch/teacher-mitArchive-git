pacitance ⇒ fast ⇒ excellent for analog and front-end
communications applications.

BJT = two neighbouring pn junctions back-to-back:
• close enough for minority carriers to interact
(can diﬀuse quickly through base)
• far apart enough for depletion regions not to interact
(prevent ”punchthrough”)

IE<0

IC>0

IB>0

VBE > 0

VBC < 0

VBE > 0 ⇒ injection of electrons from E to B
injection of holes from B to E

VBC < 0 ⇒ extraction of electrons from B to C
extraction of holes from C to B

Transistor eﬀect:
electrons injected from E to B, extracted by C!

In forward-active regime:
• VBE controls IC (”transistor eﬀect”)
• IC independent of VBC (”isolation”)
• price to pay for control: IB

To maximize βF :
• NdE (cid:29) NaB
• WE (cid:29) WB
• want npn, rather than pnp design because Dn > Dp
State-of-the-art IC BJT’s today: IC ∼ 0.1− 1 mA, βF ∼
50 − 300
βF hard to control in manufacturing environment ⇒ need
circuit techniques that are insensitive to variations in βF

• Emitter ”injects” electrons into Base,
Collector ”collects” electrons from Base.
⇒ IC controlled by VBE , independent of VBC

• Base injects holes into Emitter ⇒ IB
