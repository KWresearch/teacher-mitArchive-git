Key  questions

• Why  does  the  pn  junction  diode  exhibit  current  rec-
tiﬁcation? 
• Why does the junction current in forward bias increase 

as ∼ exp kT ?

qV
• What  are  the  leading  dependences  of  the  saturation 
current  (the  factor  in  front  of  the  exponential)?

• current  ﬂows  (with  rectifying  behavior)

Lecture  15-8 

Where  does  generation  and  recombination  take  place?


In  modern  devices,  recombination  mainly  takes  place  at 
surfaces: 
• perfect  crystalline  periodicity  broken  at  a  surface

⇒  lots  of  broken  bonds:  generation  and  recombina-
tion  centers 
• modern  devices  are  very  small 
⇒  high  area  to  volume  ratio. 

High  generation  and  recombination  activity  at  surfaces

⇒ carrier concentrations cannot deviate much from equi-
librium  values: 

n(s) (cid:5) no, p(s) (cid:5) po

Few  carriers  available  for  extraction: 
⇒  reverse  current  is  small. 
Minority  carrier  concentration  becomes  vanishingly 
small: ⇒  reverse  current  saturates.


Rectiﬁcation  property  of  pn  diode  arises  from  minority-
carrier  boundary  conditions  at  edges  of  SCR.

Key  conclusions

• Application of voltage to pn junction results in disrup
-
tion  of  balance  between  drift  and  diﬀusion  in  SCR:

–  in  forward  bias, minority  carriers  are  injected into 
quasi-neutral  regions 
–  in reverse bias, minority carriers are extracted from 
quasi-neutral  regions 
• In  forward  bias,  injected  minority  carriers  recombine 
at  surface. 
• In  reverse bias,  extracted minority  carriers  are  gener-
ated  at  surface. 
• Computation  of  boundary  conditions  across  SCR  ex-
ploits  quasi-equilibrium:  balance  between  diﬀusion 
and  drift  in  SCR  disturbed  very  little. 
• Rate  limiting  step  to  current  ﬂow:  diﬀusion  through 
quasi-neutral  regions. 
• I-V  characteristics  of  p-n  diode: 
I  = Io(exp  − 1)
