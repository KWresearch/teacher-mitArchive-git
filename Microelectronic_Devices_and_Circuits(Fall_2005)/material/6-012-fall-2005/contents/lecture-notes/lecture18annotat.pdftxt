Lecture  18-2


Key  questions

• What  other  regimes  of  operation  are  there  for  the 
BJT? 
• What  is  unique  about  each  regime?

• How  do  equivalent  circuit  models  for  the  BJT  look 
like?

• forward  active:  device  has  good  isolation  and  high 
gain; most  useful  regime; 
• saturation:  device has no isolation and is ﬂooded with 
minority  carriers  ⇒  takes  time  to  get  out  of  satura-
tion;  avoid 
• reverse:  poor  gain;  not  useful;

• cut-oﬀ:  negligible  current:  nearly  an  open  circuit; 
useful.

•  βF  hard  to  control  tightly ⇒  circuit  design  techniques 
required  to  be  insensitive  to  variations  in  βF .

•  IC  and  IE  can  have  either  sign,  depending  on  relative 
magnitude  of  VBE  and  VBC ,  and βF  and βR. 
•  In  saturation,  collector  and  base  ﬂooded  with  excess 
minority  carriers  ⇒  takes  lots  of  time  to  get  transistor
