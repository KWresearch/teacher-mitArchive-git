Key  questions

• What other  ampliﬁer  stages  can one build with  a  sin-
gle MOSFET  and  a  current  source? 
• What  is  the  uniqueness  of  these  other  stages?

between B  and  S  (vbs  = −vout).

How  does  it work? 
• since  source  is  signal  input  terminal,  body  cannot  be 
tied  up  to  source  (Cdb  is  signiﬁcant) 
• iSU P ,  IB I AS ,  and W/L  selected  to  bias  MOSFET  in 
saturation,  obtain  desired  output  bias  point,  and  de-
sired  output  swing 
• iS  ↑ ⇒  iD  ↓ ⇒  iOU T  ↓ 
• no  current  gain:  is  = −iout  (curr

ISU P  + IOU T  + IB I AS  = 0 
Select  bias  so  that  IOU T  = 0  ⇒ VOU T  = 0.

Assume MOSFET in saturation (no channel modulation):

µnCox (VGS  − VT )2  = ISU P  = −IB I AS

ID  = 

but VT  depends  on  VBS :

VT  = VT o  + γn(  −2φp  − VBS  − −2φp ) 

Must  solve  these  two  equations  iteratively  to  get  VS .

Key  conclusions


Diﬀerent MOSFET  stages  designed  to  accomplish  diﬀer-
ent  goals: 
• Common-source  stage:

–  large  voltage  gain  and  transconductance,  high  in-
put  resistance,  large  output  resistance 
– excellent transconductance ampliﬁer, reasonable volt-
age  ampliﬁer 
• Common-drain  stage:

– no  voltage  gain,  but high  input  resistance  and  low 
output  resistance 
– good  voltage  buﬀer 
• Common-gate  stage:

– no current  gain,  but  low  input  resistance  and high 
output  resistance 
– good  current  buﬀer
