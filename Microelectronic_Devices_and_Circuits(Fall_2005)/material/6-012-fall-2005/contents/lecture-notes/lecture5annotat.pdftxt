Key  questions

• What  happens  if  the  doping  distribution  in  a  semi
-
conductor  abruptly  changes  from  n-type  to  p-type? 

• Is  there  a  simple  description  of  the  electrostatics  of  a 
pn  junction?

Lecture  5-3 

1.  Introduction  to  pn  junction 
•  pn  junction:  p-region  and  n-region  in  intimate  contact

• Why  is  the  p-n  junction  worth  studying? 
It  is  present  in  virtually  every  semiconductor  device!

What  is  the carrier  concentration  distribution  in  thermal 
equilibrium?

Now  bring  them  together.  What  happens? 

Diﬀusion of electrons and holes from ma jority carrier side 
to minority  carrier  side until 
drift  balances  diﬀusion.
drift balances
diﬀusion.

Can  divide  semiconductor  in  three  regions: 
• two  quasi-neutral  n- and  p-regions  (QNR’s)

• one  space  charge  region  (SCR)


Now, want  to  know no (x),  po (x),  ρ(x),  E (x),  and φ(x). 

Solve electrostatics using simple, powerful approximation.

Key  conclusions 
• Electrostatics  of  pn  junction  in  equilibrium:

– a  space-charge  region 
–  surrounded  by  two  quasi-neutral  regions 
⇒  built-in  potential  across  p-n  junction

• To  ﬁrst  order,  carrier  concentrations  in  space-charge 
region  are much  smaller  than  doping  level 
⇒  depletion  approximation. 
• Contact  potential  at metal-semiconductor  junctions:

⇒ from contact to contact, there is no potential build-
up  across  pn  junction
