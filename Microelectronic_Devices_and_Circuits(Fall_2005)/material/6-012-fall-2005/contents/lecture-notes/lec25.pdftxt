2. compute Thevenin resistance RT i seen by each Ci with
all other C ’s open,

width is:

Simplify:
• CD amp is about driving low RL from high RS ⇒

ωH '

• CD stage operates as voltage buﬀer with Av ,LF '

ωH '

Since Cgd and 1/gm are small, if RS is not too high, ωH
can be rather high (approach ωT ).

Miller analysis of Cgs:

agrees with above result.
Note, since Av → 1, C 0

2. Cascode ampliﬁer

Common-source stage: excellent transconductance am-
pliﬁer, but bandwidth hurt by Miller eﬀect.

What’s a circuit designer to do?

vs

How does this address the problem?
• Rin2 very small ⇒ iOU T 1 can change a lot with vOU T 1
changing little ⇒ small voltage gain in CS stage ⇒
no Miller eﬀect ⇒ high bandwidth
• CG stage also has high bandwidth

Cascode: excellent transconductance ampliﬁer with high
bandwidth.

Key conclusions
• Common-drain ampliﬁer:
– Voltage gain ' 1, Miller eﬀect nearly completely
eliminates impact of Cgs (bootstrapping)
– if RS is not too high, CD amp has high bandwidth
• Cascode ampliﬁer:
– eﬀective sharing of current source
– Miller eﬀect minimized by reducing voltage gain of
CS stage as a result of low input impedance of CG
stage
– transconductance ampliﬁer with high bandwidth
