Key  questions

• What are the physical mechanisms responsible for cur-
rent  ﬂow  in  semiconductors? 
• How do electrons and holes in a semiconductor behave 
in  an  electric  ﬁeld? 
• How do electrons and holes in a semiconductor behave 
if  their  concentration  is  non-uniform  in  space?

1.  Thermal  Motion 

In  thermal  equilibrium,  carriers  are  not  sitting  still:

• undergo collisions with vibrating Si atoms (Brownian 
motion) 
• electrostatically  interact  with  charged  dopants  and 
with  each  other 

Characteristic  time  constant  of  thermal  motion  - mean 
free  time  between  collisions: 
τc  ≡  col lision  time  [s] 

In  between  collisions,  carriers  acquire  high  velocity: 
vth  ≡  thermal  velocity  [cm/s] 

...but  get  nowhere!

Characteristic  length  of  thermal motion: 
λ ≡  mean  free  path  [cm] 

λ = vthτc 

Put  numbers  for  Si  at  300  K: 
τc  (cid:2) 10
−14  ∼ 10
−13  s 
vth  (cid:2) 107  cm/s 
⇒ λ  (cid:2) 1 ∼ 10  nm 
For  reference,  state-of-the-art  MOSFETs  today: 
Lg  (cid:2) 0.1  µm 
⇒  carriers  undergo many  collisions  in modern  devices

2.  Carrier  Drift


Apply  electric  ﬁeld  to  semiconductor: 
E  ≡  electric  ﬁeld  [V /cm] 
⇒  net  force  on  carrier 

F  = ±qE 

E 

-

Between collisions, carriers accelerate in direction of ﬁeld: 
v (t) = at = − qE t 
mn 

for  electrons 

v (t) =  qE t 
mp 

for  holes

Mobility  is measure  of  ease  of  carrier  drift: 
•  if  τc  ↑,  longer  time  between  collisions → µ ↑ 
•  if m ↓,  ”lighter”  particle → µ ↑ 

Mobility  depends  on  doping.  For  Si  at  300K:

Diﬀusion:  particle movement  in  response  to  concentration 
gradient.

Elements  of  diﬀusion: 
• a medium  (Si  crystal)

• a  gradient  of  particles  (electrons  and  holes)  inside 
the medium 
• collisions between particles and medium send particles

oﬀ  in  random  directions: 
→  overall,  particle  movement  down  the  gradient

among  particles  and medium  atoms

Summary:  relationship  between  v ,  F , and  J


In  semiconductors:  charged  particles  move 
⇒  particle  ﬂux ⇒  electrical  current  density 
Particle  ﬂux:  number  of  particles  that  cross  surface  of

unit  area  placed  normal  to  particle  ﬂow  every unit  time


Fn 

vn dt 

Relationship  between  particle  ﬂux  and  velocity: 

Fn  = nvn 

Fp  = pvp 

Current  density:  amount  of  charge  that  crosses  surface 
of unit area placed normal to particle ﬂow every unit time 
Jn  = −qFn  = −qnvn 

Jp  = qFp  = qpvp
