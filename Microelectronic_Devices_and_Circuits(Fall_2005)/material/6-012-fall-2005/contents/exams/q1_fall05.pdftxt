General  guidelines  (please  read  carefully  before  starting): 

•	 Make  sure   to  write  your  name  on  the  space   designated  above.  
•	 Open  book:  you  can   use   any  material  you  wish. 
•	 All  answers  should  be  given  in  the  space   provided.   Please  do  not   turn  in  any  extra  material.  
If  you   need  more   space,  use  the  back  page. 
•	 You   have  120  minutes   to  complete  your   quiz. 
•	 Make  reasonable  approximations   and   state  them,  i.e.  quasi­neutrality,  depletion  approxima­
tion,  etc. 
•	 Partial  credit  will  be  given  for  setting  up  problems  without   calculations.  NO  credit  will  be  
given  for  answers  without   reasons. 
•	 Use  the  symbols   utilized   in  class   for  the   various  physical  parameters,  i.e.  µn ,  ID ,  E ,  etc.  
•	 Every   numerical  answer  must  have  the  proper   units  next   to  it.   Points   will   be  subtracted   for 
answers  without  units  or  with  wrong  units. 
•	 Use  φ  = 0  at  no  =  po  =  ni  as  potential  reference. 
•	 Use  the  following  fundamental  constants   and  physical   parameters   for   silicon  and   silicon  dioxide 
at  room  temperature: 
ni  = 1  × 1010  cm−3

kT   /q   = 0.025  V

q  = 1.60  × 10−19  C

�s  = 1.05  × 10−12  F /cm

1.  (25  points)  A  bar  of  silicon   is  doped  with  acceptors  as   shown  below.  The   doping  density variers 
smoothly  and  motononically  in  the  x  direction  from  NA  �  ni  at  x  = 0  to  NA  �  ni  at  x  =  L. 
Na (L/2)  =  ni .  Around   x  =  L,  the   acceptor  proﬁle  becomes  uniform.  The   donor  density   is  zero  
everywhere.  This  is   a  thermal  equilibrium  situation.
