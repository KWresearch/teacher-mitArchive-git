General  guidelines  (please  read  carefully  before  starting): 

•	 Make  sure   to  write  your  name  on  the  space   designated  above.  
•	 Open  book:  you  can   use   any  material  you  wish. 
•	 All  answers  should  be  given  in  the  space   provided.   Please  do  not   turn  in  any  extra  material.  
If  you   need  more   space,  use  the  back  of  the  page. 
•	 You   have  120  minutes   to  complete  your   quiz. 
•	 Make  reasonable  approximations   and   state  them,  i.e.  quasi­neutrality,  depletion  approxima­
tion,  etc. 
•	 Partial  credit  will  be  given  for  setting  up  problems  without   calculations.  NO  credit  will  be  
given  for  answers  without   reasons. 
•	 Use  the  symbols   utilized   in  class   for  the   various  physical  parameters,  i.e.  µn ,  ID ,  E ,  etc.  
•	 Every   numerical  answer  must  have  the  proper   units  next   to  it.   Points   will   be  subtracted   for 
answers  without  units  or  with  wrong  units. 
•	 Use  φ  = 0  at  no  =  po  =  ni  as  potential  reference. 
•	 Use  the  following  fundamental  constants   and  physical   parameters   for   silicon  and   silicon  dioxide 
at  room  temperature:

1.  (30  points)  Below  is  an  n+  ­ polysilicon­gate  MOSFET.  The  substrate   doping  is  Na  = 1017  cm−3 
and  the  insulator  thickness   is  5  nm.  The  gate  length  L  = 0.25  µm  while  the  gate  width  is  W  = 
2.5  µm.  The  inversion  layer   mobility  for   the  MOSFET  is   µN  =  250  cm2/V  ·  s. 

A  capacitance  voltage  curve  of   the  n+  poly­silicon  gate  MOSFET  was   taken  by   connecting  the 
source,  drain   and  body   terminals  together.   A voltage  was   applied  between   the  gate  and  the  body.  

With  the   device  biased  as  follows:  VBS   = 0  V  ,  VDS   = 0.1  V  ,  VGS  = 1.11  V  ,  answer  the  following  
questions: 

(1a)  (5  points)  Calculate   the  sheet  charge  density  at   the  drain  end  of  the  device,   Qn(y  =  L) 
(numerical  answer  expected). 

(1b)  (5  points)  Calculate  the  electron  drift  velocity  at  the  drain  end  of  the  device,   vn (y  =  L) 
(numerical  answer  expected). 

(1c)  (5  points)  Calculate   the  electron  drift   velocity  in  the  middle  of  the  channel  vn(y   =  L/2) 
(numerical  answer  expected). 

(1d)  (5  points)  This  device  is  now  desired   to  operate  at  VDS   = 1.8  V  and  VGS  = 1.35  V  with  a 
current  ID  = 1  mA.  This  requires  shifting  the  threshold  voltage  VT  by  means   of  an  applied  body  
voltage,  VBS   .  What  is  VT  in  this  situation?  (Numerical  answer  expected). 

(1e)  (5  points)  For  the  bias  conditions  of  (1d),  compute  the  sheet   charge  density  at   the  source  end 
of  the  channel  Qn(y  = 0)   (numerical  answer  expected). 

(1f ) (5  points)  For  the  bias  conditions  of  (1d),  calculate  the   electron  drift   velocity  at   the  source  end 
of  the  channel,  vn (y  = 0)   (numerical  answer  expected). 

2.  (30  points)   The   circuit  diagram  for   an  NMOS  inverter   driving  a  load  capacitance   CL,  and  a 
graph  of  its  static   input­output  characteristics,  are  shown  below.   The  graph   actually  shows  two  sets 
of  characteristics,  the  desired  characteristics   and  the  measured  characteristics.  The  two  are  diﬀerent 
because  the  actual  inverter  was  not   fabricated  exactly   as   it   was  designed.  The  point  of  this  problem 
is  to  determine  what  went  wrong  during   fabrication.

The  circuit  parameters   under  suspicion  are  the   MOSFET  gate   width  to  length   ratio,   W/L,  the 
MOSFET  gate  oxide  thickness,  tox ,  the  MOSFET  body  doping   level,  Na ,  and   the  pull­up  resistance, 
R.  Further,  assume  that   one  and   only  one   of  these  four   parameters  was   incorrectly  fabricated.  

(2a)  (3  points)  From   the  graph  of  the  desired  characteristics,  estimate  the  desired  threshold  voltage 
VT  of  the  MOSFET  (numerical  answer  expected). 

(2b)  (3  points)  From   the  graph   of  the  measured  characteristics,   estimate  the  actual   threshold  voltage 
VT  of  the  MOSFET  (numerical  answer  expected). 

(2c)  (3  points)  From   the  graph   of  the  desired  characteristics,  estimate  the   product   of  the  desired 
pull­up   resistance  R  and   the  desired  K  parameter   of  the  MOSFET  (where  K  =  L  µnCox ).  That  is,  
W
estimate  the  desired  product  RK   (numerical  answer  expected). 

(2d)  (3  points)  From   the  graph  of  the  measured characteristics,  estimate  the  product   of  the  actual  
pull­up  resistance  R  and   the   actual  K  parameter   of  the  MOSFET  (where  K  =  L  µnCox ).  That  is, 
W
estimate  the  actual  product  RK   (numerical   answer  expected). 

In  answering  the  following  questions,   remember   to  assume  that  one  and  only  one  of  the  four   param­
eters  was  incorrectly  fabricated. 

(2e)  (3  points)  Could  the  gate  width  to  length  ratio,   W/L,  have  been   incorrectly  fabricated?  Why 
or  why  not?  If  ”Yes”,  is  it  too   big  or  too   small?  (Appropriate  explanation  expected). 

Circle  One: 

Yes 

No 

(2f )  (3  points)  Could  the   gate  oxide  thickness,  tox ,  have  been  incorrectly  fabricated?  Why  or  why 
not?  If  ”Yes”,  is  it  too  big  or   too  small?  (Appropriate  explanation  expected). 

Circle   One: 

Yes 

No 

(2g)  (3  points)  Could   the  body  doping  density,   Na ,  have   been  incorrectly  fabricated?  Why  or  why  
not?  If  ”Yes”  is  it  too  big  or  too  small?  (Appropriate  explanation  expected). 

Circle  One: 

Yes 

No 

(2h)  (3  points)  Could   the  pull­up  resistance,  R,  have   been  incorrectly  fabricated?  Why  or   why   not? 
If  ”Yes”  is  it  too  big  or  too  small?  (Appropriate  explanation  expected). 

Circle  One:

No 

You  observe  that  when  the  inverter  is   driving  a  known  load  capacitance  CL ,  one  of  the  propagation 
delays  (tP LH   and   tP HL )  is  not  as  desired.  In  particular,  the  propagation  delay  from  a  rising  input 
to  a  falling  output  is  longer  than   expected,  while  the   propagation  delay  from   a  falling  input  to  a 
rising  output  is  exactly  what  was  expected. 

(2i)  (6  points)  Based  on  all  available  evidence,  which  circuit  parameter  was   incorrectly  fabricated? 
What  is  the  ratio  of  the  actual  parameter  divided  by  the   desired  parameter?   (Appropriate  explana­
tion  expected). 

3.  (24  points)  An   pn  diode   at  a  certain  forward   bias   point   is   characterized  by  the  following  values 
of  small­signal  equivalent  circuit   elements: 

rd  = 25  Ω  

Cd  = 40  pF 

At  this  bias  point,  the  depletion  capacitance  is  negligible  with  respect  to  the  diﬀusion   capacitance.  

In  the   following  questions,  you   are  asked  to  estimate  how  the   values   of  these  two  elements  change  if 
the   diode  is  modiﬁed  in  several  ways.  Assume  that  in  all  cases,   the   diode   is  ideal,  very  asymmetric,  
and  that  all  its  behavior  is  dominated  by  its  lowly  doped  side.  State  any  other  assumptions  you 
need  to  make. 

(3a)  (4  points)  The  diode  area  is  doubled.  Nothing  else  is   changed.   The  diode  is   biased  at   the  same 
current   as  in  the  problem   statement  (numerical  answers   expected). 

(3b)  (4  points)  The  diode  area  is  doubled.  Nothing  else   is   changed.  The  diode  is  biased  at   the  same 
voltage  as  in  the   problem  statement  (numerical  answers  expected). 

(3c)  (4  points)  The   doping  level  of  the  lowly  doped  side  is   doubled.   Nothing  else  is   changed.  The 
diode  is  biased   at  the  same  current  as  in  the  problem  statement   (numerical  answers   expected). 

(3d)  (4  points)  The   doping  level  of  the  lowly  doped  side   is   doubled.   Nothing   else  is   changed.  The 
diode  is  biased   at  the  same  voltage  as  in  the  problem  statement  (numerical  answers  expected).  

(3e)  (4  points)  The   thickness  of  the  lowly  doped  side  is  doubled.  Nothing  else  is   changed.  The  diode 
is  biased   at  the  same  current  as  in  the  problem  statement   (numerical  answers  expected). 

(3f ) (4  points)  The  thickness  of  the  lowly  doped  side   is   doubled.  Nothing  else   is   changed.  The  diode 
is  biased   at  the  same  voltage   as  in  the  problem   statement   (numerical  answers   expected). 

4.  (16  points)  Consider  a  CMOS   logic  gate  driving  a   capacitive  load  CL.  The  inverter  is  made  with 
minimum  size  transistors,  as   sketched  below:

In  the   above  diagram,  the  two  numbers   next   to  each transistor  give   its   gate  dimensions  (width/length) 
in  microns.  In   solving  this  problem,  assume  that  CL  is  the  dominant  capacitance  in   this   circuit.   All  
other  capacitances  can   be  neglected   next   to  CL .
