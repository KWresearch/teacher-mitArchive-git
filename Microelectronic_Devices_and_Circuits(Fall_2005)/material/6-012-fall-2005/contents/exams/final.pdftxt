In studying the ampliﬁer, make use of the following information:

• To avoid undesired reﬂections within the input and output cables, the ampliﬁer must be
designed to have a 50 Ω input resistance and a 50 Ω output resistance. (To learn why, take
6.013!)
• The coupling capacitors in the block diagram and circuit isolate the biasing inside the ampliﬁer
from the cables. Assume the capacitors are large enough to be short circuits for the purposes
of all small-signal modeling.
• Assume that both transistors in the ampliﬁer exhibit the same forward current gain β , the
same base-emitter capacitance Cπ , and the same base-collector capacitance Cµ . When nu-
merical values are needed, let βF = 200, Cπ = 1 pF, and Cµ = 0.1 pF. Also, let the thermal
voltage Vth be 25 mV. For both transistors, ignore their small-signal collector-emitter output
resistance until Part 1i).
• Assume that the two bias current sources in the ampliﬁer, I1 and I2 , are ideal (i.e. their
associated internal resistance is inﬁnity).

1a) (4 points) The ampliﬁer comprises two stages. For each of the following ob jectives, explain in
a few sentences why the ampliﬁer might be well-suited to meeting the ob jective.

1b) (10 points) Draw a small-signal circuit model of the entire ampliﬁer including the Thevenin
equivalent of the input cable, and the equivalent resistive load of the output cable. (Again,
ignore the coupling capacitors.) Clearly label the value of each component in the ampliﬁer
model in terms of R, I1 , I2, βF and Vth . If you choose to label the components with symbols
such as gm and Rπ , make sure to express those symbols in terms R, I1 , I2 , β and Vth . (Neat
drawing and appropriate expressions expected).

4. (28 points) Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is widely used in computer applications.
This is because DRAMs are relatively fast, can be made very dense and are fairly inexpensive.
Consider a one-transistor (DRAM) cell sketched below:

Cs

Vs

word(cid:13)
line

In this DRAM cell, the information is stored in the form of charge in the capacitor Cs. If the voltage
across the capacitor Vs is HI, then a ”1” is stored. If Vs is LO, a ”0” is stored.

The ”word line” is used to select cells for reading or writing, as follows:

• if the word line is at ground (Vw = 0), the cells on that line are not selected for reading or
writing;
• if the word line is at Vw = VDD , the cells on that line are selected for reading or writing.

The ”bit line” is used to write or read the bits. It has three possible states:

• if the bit line is at Vb = VDD , a ”1” is to be written
• if the bit line is at Vb = 0 V , a ”0” is to be written
• if the bit line is ﬂoating, the stored bit in the capacitor is to be read.

In this problem you will analyze the basic operation of the DRAM cell. In this DRAM cell the
transistor is characterized by the following parameters: L = 1 µm, W = 4 µm, µnCox = 50 µA/V 2,
VT = 1 V . The storage capacitor is Cs = 50 f F . The bit line has a capacitance CB = 500 f F .
VDD = 3.3 V .

2 Consider the operation of writing a ”1” when the cell had a ”0” stored at t = 0− , that is,
Vs (t = 0− ) = 0. At t = 0, the word line and the bit line are set to VDD (Vw = Vb = VDD ).

(4a) (2 points) In what regime is the transistor operating at t = 0+ ? Explain. (Suitable explanation
expected).

(4b) (2 points) In what regime is the transistor operating at t → ∞? Explain. (Suitable explanation
expected).

(4c) (4 points) Estimate the value of Vs at t → ∞. Explain your result. (Numerical answer and
suitable explanation expected).

(4d) (4 points) Estimate the charge in Cs at t → ∞. (Numerical answer expected).

(4e) (4 points) Estimate the time that it takes for the capacitor to charge up to 80% of its ﬁnal
value. (Numerical answer expected).

2 Now consider the operation of writing a ”0” when the cell stored a ”1” at t = 0− , that is,
Vs (t = 0− ) = Vs (H I ) from previous part (if you didn’t solve for (4c), assume that Vs (H I ) = VDD ).
At t = 0, the word line is set to VDD (Vw = VDD ) and the bit line is set to zero (Vb = 0).

(4f ) (2 points) In what regime is the transistor operating at t = 0+ ? Explain. (Suitable explanation
expected).

(4g) (2 points) In what regime is the transistor operating at t → ∞? Explain. (Suitable explanation
expected).

2 Now consider the operation of reading a ”1”. In this case, again, Vs (t = 0− ) = Vs (H I ) (if you
didn’t solve for (4c), assume that Vs(H I ) = VDD ). At t = 0, the word line is set to VDD (Vw = VDD )
and the bit line is left ﬂoating with an initial value Vb (t = 0− ) = 0.

(4h) (2 points) In what regime is the transistor operating at t = 0+ ? Explain. (Suitable explanation
expected).

(4i) (2 points) In what regime is the transistor operating at t → ∞? Explain. (Suitable explanation
expected).

(4j) (4 points) Estimate the value of Vb(t → ∞). (Numerical answer expected).
