***** Course Description *****
6.012 is the header course for the department's "Devices, Circuits and Systems"
concentration. The topics covered include: modeling of microelectronic devices,
basic microelectronic circuit analysis and design, physical electronics of
semiconductor junction and MOS devices, relation of electrical behavior to
internal physical processes, development of circuit models, and understanding
the uses and limitations of various models. The course uses incremental and
large-signal techniques to analyze and design bipolar and field effect
transistor circuits, with examples chosen from digital circuits, single-ended
and differential linear amplifiers, and other integrated circuits. This course
is 12 units and is worth 4 Engineering Design Points.
