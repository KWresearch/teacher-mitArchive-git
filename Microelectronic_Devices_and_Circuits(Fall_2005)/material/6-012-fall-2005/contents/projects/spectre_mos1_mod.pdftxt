Note:  This equation applies when VGSVON and VDSVDSAT. 

Because the standard SPICE Level-1 model does not include any of the 
short-channel phenomena, such as mobility modulation and velocity-
saturation effects, the uses for this model are limited. To retain high 
computational efficiency and improve accuracy, the SpectreÂ®  circuit 
simulator incorporates two parameters, theta and vmax, into the Level-
1 model. The meanings of theta and vmax are the same as those in the 
Level-3 model. The modified Level-1 model is like a simplified Level-3 
model. Spectre uses the modified Level-1 model if theta or vmax (or 
both) is specified. The drain current equations for the modified Level-1 
model are shown in the following section.
