1. Overview

The explosive growth in data communications has stimulated the development of optical systems
for high channel capacity (typically 4-16 channels) and high bandwidth. In a ﬁber optic system,
a transmitter encodes the data in the form of laser pulses that are transmitted over a long optical
ﬁber. At the other end, a receiver detects the attenuated optical signal and ampliﬁes it to digital
levels.

Figure 1: Block diagram of an optical transmitter and receiver.

A block diagram of an optical transmitter and receiver is shown in Figure 1. On the transmitter path,
the data is multiplexed, encoded, and error correction bits are added. A laser driver and modulator
drive the laser diode, which transmits an optical signal over the ﬁber. After some loss in the ﬁber,
the optical signal is detected at the receiver end by the photodiode. A transimpedance ampliﬁer
converts the small photodiode current into a voltage, which is then ampliﬁed to digital levels for
subsequent digital signal processing. The transimpedance ampliﬁer is also called a transresistance
ampliﬁer in 6.012; for cultural reasons, we will stick with the transimpedance ampliﬁer terminology.

Integration of all of the functions on either side of Figure 1 onto a single CMOS chip would save
costs, but the implementation has eluded system designers in part due to the complexity of realizing
high-performance receiver circuits in CMOS. The goal of this design pro ject is to design a fast, high
gain, low noise, and low power optical receiver in an inexpensive CMOS process.

2. Design problem statement

Figure 2 shows the schematic of the optical receiver. It consists of three CMOS stages: a tran-
simpedance ampliﬁer, a saturating or limiting ampliﬁer, and an output driver. We describe these
three stages next.

Light creates electron-hole pairs that produce a current Ilight in the reverse-biased photodiode. The
diode can be modelled as a current source of value Ilight which ﬂows in the reverse bias direction of
the diode. Although the laser diode produces a large square wave pulse at the other end of the ﬁber,
dispersion and loss make the diode current Ilight appear sinusoidal. This current is only guaranteed
to have a peak value of about 10 µA. Depending on the system, loss in the ﬁber could be lower
and the peak diode current could be larger. However, to ensure proper operation for all systems,
the worst-case (i.e. minimum) current must be used for the design. The receiver should operate at
speeds up to 1 MHz.

PMOS Device biased
in the linear region
used as a resistor 

Figure 2: Schematic of optical receiver.

The ﬁrst-stage CMOS inverter I1 and feedback resistor constitute a transimpedance ampliﬁer that
converts the photodiode current into a voltage V1 at node n1 . A feedback resistor sets the gain of

2

the stage, which must be large to reduce the eﬀects of noise in later stages.

To set a reasonable design point you might ﬁrst want to start by using a simple linear resistor and
determine what value you could use to meet you design goals. Unfortunately, though linear resistors
can be realized in silicon technology by using undoped poly for large resistor values, this approach
consumes a lot of area. With the knowledge of device physics that you have acquired in 6.012, in
order to minimize the cost you have decided to realize this resistor using a PMOS biased in the linear
region. An additional concern in this ampliﬁer is that the gain needs to be as constant as possible
over the expected range of Ilight values. This means that the resistor value should be as constant as
possible over the range of voltages at its terminals, or, in other words, as linear as possible. Power
must be minimized in this design, so no extra bias circuitry can be aﬀorded. The PMOS device is
to be connected as shown in Fig. 2 with the gate of the PMOS connected to GND and the bulk
connected to VDD . The design decision that you need to make is to size the PMOS appropriately
to achieve the desired value of the resistor.

The closed-loop small-signal gain V1
of this ﬁrst transimpedance ampliﬁer needs to be as constant
Ilight
as possible over the range of Ilight values shown in Figure 3. You will need to derive an expression
for this closed-loop gain V1
, where V1 is the voltage at node n1 . Notice that since Ilight is small,
Ilight
Vdiode (the voltage at node ndiode ) and V1 will stay close to the midpoint of inverter I1, and I1 will
be held in the high-gain region. Thus the transistors in inverter I1 will stay in the saturation region,
and the small signal model can be used over the full range of input current. For the Ilight shown
in Figure 3, V1 should have a peak-to-peak amplitude of at least 0.1 Vpp (peak-to-peak voltage), as
indicated in Figure 3. For noise immunity, V1 should be near the middle of the total voltage range.
Therefore, the minimum of V1 should be at 2.5 V, as indicated in Figure 3. To ensure that the
photodiode stays in reverse bias, and in an attempt to keep the depletion region width constant, the
reverse biased diode voltage Vdiode should vary by no more than 10 mV peak-to-peak (10 mVpp ). To
understand how Vdiode varies with the input current and output voltage, you will also need to derive
an expression for Vdiode as a function of Ilight and V1 .

The second stage is called a limiting or saturating ampliﬁer. This high-gain CMOS stage ampliﬁes
the small voltage V1 . For maximum ampliﬁcation, V1 should be in the high gain region of inverter
I2. The open-loop voltage gain of the limiting ampliﬁer Av2 should be large enough to ensure that
V1 is ampliﬁed to full logic levels. To scale 0.1 Vpp at node n1 to 5 Vpp at node n2 requires a gain of
50. Since the gain away from the midpoint of the inverter will be less than the maximum gain Av2 ,
the speciﬁcation is |Av2 | ≥ 90.

The output CMOS stage drives both the wire capacitance and the input capacitance of the digital
signal processing circuits. This can be modelled as a constant 50 fF load capacitor. The output
driver should be high speed to maximize the frequency at which the receiver can operate. Since
the output will be routed to the digital side of the chip, it should also have good noise margins.
Speciﬁcally, tP HL , tP LH ≤ 0.5 nsec and N ML , N MH ≥ 1.4 V between the input and output of
inverter I3.

Power consumption is a big diﬀerentiator in system design. To get the edge over competitors, power
should be minimized. Since the input and output voltages of inverter I1 are so small, I1 will stay
in the high gain region, dissipating static power. To simplify your hand calculations, calculate the
power dissipated in I1 when Ilight=0. There is also dynamic power required to charge and discharge
the parasitic and load capacitance at nodes n1 , n2 and nout . The total power consumption should

shown is the desired minimum peak-to-peak voltage at node n1 .

be minimized, which means that only enough power should be used to adequately meet the other
speciﬁcations.

The cost of the optical receiver is related to the amount of silicon die area that is used. To maximize
proﬁts, the die area should be minimized. This means that transistor sizes should be as small as
possible without compromising any of the other design speciﬁcations.

In summary, the design challenges and speciﬁcations are:

1. Derive an expression for the closed-loop transimpedance small-signal gain V1
. To make
Ilight
this equation easier to use, write it in terms of the open-loop voltage gain Av1 of the ﬁrst
inverter I1. Assume a low-frequency small signal model, i.e. that all of the capacitors in the
model are open circuits. To simplify your derivation replace the PMOS with a real resistance.
Design this gain to be large enough that V1 is at least 0.1Vpp for Ilight=10 µA.

2. Derive an expression for Vdiode as a function of Ilight and V1 . Design so the swing on node
Vdiode is less than 10 mVpp (∆Vdiode ≤ 10 mVpp ).

3. Choose the size of feedback PMOS transistor needed to acheive the desired value of resistance.

4. Design the logic threshold VM 2 of inverter I2 so the voltage V1 at node n1 is in the high-gain
region of I2.

5.

|AV 2 | ≥ 90.

6. At the output, tpHL , tpLH ≤ 0.5 nsec and N ML , N MH ≥ 1.4V . Note that tpHL and tpLH are
deﬁned between the input and output of I3.

7. Minimize power dissipation Pdiss . This means that no more power should be used other than
that required to meet the speciﬁcations.

8. Minimize area. Again, enough area should be used to meet the speciﬁcations.

3. Device models

The SPECTRE model parameters for minimum-size CMOS transistors in our technology can be
OCW  website
found in the CADENCE tutorial on the 6.012
. All minimum size transistors have
dimensions: Lnmin = 1.5 µm, Wnmin = 3 µm, Lpmin = 1.5 µm, Wpmin = 6 µm. The design may
require the use of larger transistors than the minimum size. Due to processing constraints, W and
L can scale up in increments no smaller than 0.5 µm. The parameter LAMBDA must be changed
OCW
according to the transistor gate length, as indicated in CADENCE tutorial on the 6012
website.
Read §4.6 of Howe & Sodini to see how transistor capacitances scale with geometry. Note
that processing constraints do not allow the dimensions of these transistors to be reduced below the
minimum sizes.

4. Deliverables

The deliverables of this design problem are as follows.

1. (20 points) A one-page design review abstract. This is an abstract summarizing your pro ject
for a design review meeting. At the design review, your design (as well as others for other
parts of the chip) will be presented. It should bring other designers that will attend the review
up to speed on your design. The abstract should concisely state the nature of the problem,
the key design issues and trade-oﬀs involved, your design strategy arguing why it is a good
one, and the important results. The abstract should be typed and well-written to ensure that
you keep your job in this tough economy!

2. (60 points) A technical report with the following parts:

(a) Summary of design decisions and hand calculations. Here you should show a schematic
diagram of your complete design. On the schematic you should indicate the selected
transistor dimensions. You should describe and comment on the following:

V1
i. Derivation of expression for closed-loop gain of the transimpedance ampliﬁer
Ilight
in terms of the open-loop voltage gain Av1 of inverter I1. Comment on how the
feedback resistor and inverter I1 should be designed (i.e. how the transistors should
be sized.).
ii. Describe and defend your PMOS transistor sizing to implement the feedback re-
sistor.
iii. Hand calculations of the closed-loop voltage gain for the transimpedance ampliﬁer.
Also include hand calculations for the value of the feedback resistor, Av1 and VM 1 .
iv. Hand calculations for VM 2 , Av2 .
v. Hand calculations for tP HL , tP LH , N ML , N MH of inverter I3. Notice that the
equations for tP HL and tP LH derived in class assume that the input switches
instantaneously. Is this true of the voltage V2 at node n2 ? Why might your hand
calculations for propagation delay not quite match the CADENCE simulations?
vi. Hand calculations for the static and dynamic power dissipation. Remember to use
Ilight = 0 to simplify your hand calculation for the static power of inverter I1.
vii. Hand calculations for the die area consumed by each transistor as well as the total
design area. The area for each transistor can be estimated as W ∗ (L + 2 ∗ Ldif f ).
Compare the area of your feedback transistor to the area that would be needed to

6

implement the same resistance as an integrated circuit polysilicon resistor. Assume
Ω
the polysilicon resistor has Rsh=100
square and minimum dimensions of 0.5 µm.
Your hand calculations should be commented appropriately. You should describe the
thought process that you followed in your design, the trade-oﬀs that you faced and how
you arrived at your design.

(b) CADENCE schematics and printouts. You should carry out the following CADENCE
simulations:

i. DC transfer characteristics of the transimpedance ampliﬁer stage. Two simulations
should be performed. One without the feedback resistor and a DC voltage at the
input so Av1 and VM 1 can be found. The second DC sweep should replace the
input with a current source and include the feedback transistor so that you can
ﬁnd the closed-loop gain V1
of the transimpedance ampliﬁer. You may want to
Ilight
create separate CADENCE schematics for these simulations. Turn in a printout
of the schematics and plots of the waveforms Vdiode , V1 , V2 , and Vout .
ii. Transient simulation of the transimpedance ampliﬁer stage. Please turn in a print-
out of the transient simulation of V1 for the Ilight given in Figure 3.
iii. DC transfer characteristics of the limiting ampliﬁer. From this simulation, extract
Av2 and VM 2 .
iv. DC transfer characteristics of the output driver. From this simulation, extract
N ML and N MH .
v. Transient simulation for the entire design showing waveforms for Vdiode , V1 , V2 and
Vout . Use the Analog Design Environment in CADENCE to extract the propaga-
tion delays at the output tpHL and tpLH as well as the total power dissipation. To
avoid initial transitory eﬀects, use 3rd or 4th clock cycles for the tpHL and tpLH
extractions. Turn in a printout of the waveforms to substantiate your results

The ﬁnal CADENCE netlist of the entire design (the one used for the transient sim-
MIT course website
ulation, part (v)) should be submitted to the
. The netlist can be found in
<your home dir>/simulation/<name of the test bench>/spectre/schematic/netlist/input.scs

Brief analysis: You should comment on how, as a result of Cadence simulations, you had
to change some of the design parameters from those selected in the hand calculations
in order to meet the speciﬁcations.

(c) Suggestions for future work. Although the receiver in this pro ject is only running at
a speed of 1 MHz, modern day optical communications systems are running at speeds
of 1 Gb/s and up. Speculate brieﬂy on what you would need to change to reach these
speeds, and what other design parameters might suﬀer. A few sentences should suﬃce.

3. (10 points) Answer sheet with summary of results. Please use the sheet at the end of this
handout to summarize your results. Fill in the transistor sizes used for each inverter and
the feedback transistor, give the expression you derived for the closed-loop gain of the tran-
simpedance ampliﬁer in terms of Av1 , and give the expression derived for Vdiode in terms of
Ilight and V1 . Compare and summarize the results of your hand calculations and CADENCE
simulations. Also ﬁll in the missing speciﬁcations, and don’t forget to include units in all of
your answers.

4. (10 points) Post-mortem and evaluation. On a separate page, please give us feedback on this
assignment. Answer at least the following questions: Were the instructions clear? What did
you learn from doing this assignment? What was the most frustrating part of the assignment?

7

The most satisfying part? How many hours did it take you? Please feel free to oﬀer other
opinions, suggestions or advice; don’t be afraid to be candid. The grader will check that you
have at least provided an answer to the above questions, then he or she will separate this

OCW
that is available in the Pro ject category of the 6.012
.
 
Hint for getting started on the transimpedance ampliﬁer stage design: Think about what the voltages
V1 and Vdiode are when when Ilight = 0. How about when Ilight =10 µA?

Hint for getting started with your design: start your simulations with just the ﬁrst stage tran-
simpedance ampliﬁer design and an ideal feedback resistor. Understand the simulations of this
circuit and meet the speciﬁcations before replacing your resistor with a transistor. Similarly, you
may want to simulate each stage independently before connecting them together.

Hint for hand calculation of dynamic power: think about the voltage swings and capacitances at
each node. Which node(s) should dominate the dynamic power and which nodes can you ignore?

OCW
To measure the power dissipation please refer to the second CADENCE tutorial on the 6.012
 website
. Choose t=4 µs to start since it is suﬃciently away from any startup transients. Measure
until t=5 µs so that the measurement is taken over one period of the input.

 

For the diode, you can use a current source from analogLib called isin and set the dc current to 5u
the amplitude to 5u and the frequency to 1 MHz.

When doing hand calculations, include the drain-body, source-body and gate-source capacitance for
your transistors, as they all have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the speed and power dissipation of the circuit.
To simplify the hand calculations, assume the gate-source capacitance is equal to 2
3 W LCox . Also
assume that the source-body and drain-body capacitors are bias independent with a value equal to
the zero voltage capacitance. This will produce a conservative design, as the average capacitance is
smaller than this. In general, a ”hand calculation” means the use of simple equations to calculate

8

results. In this case, these are the equations derived in class and in the book for delay, noise margins,
etc.

Give yourself plenty of design room for the coarseness of hand calculations. In the end, it is the
output of the CADENCE simulation that will be used to determine whether your design meets specs.

The design process is outlined below.
It involves thinking about and understanding the circuit,
not using Excel or another program to try to optimize parameters (you’ll ﬁnd that this won’t work
anyway!)

1. Think about how the circuits should work.

2. Perform hand calculations to get a rough idea of the tradeoﬀs of the circuit parameters (device
sizes, etc) with the relevant design parameters.

3. Come up with a rough hand calculation for the device sizes required to meet the speciﬁcations.

4. Simulate your circuit in CADENCE to verify that it functions and meets the speciﬁcations.
If it does not meet the speciﬁcations, use your analytical models to guide the direction in
which you need to change the device sizes. Revise your device sizes and re-simulate.

The eﬀort involved in this assignment is substantial. You should start early. There are many aspects
to this design problem that will require sustained attention on your part for a substantial amount
of time. This assignment cannot be done at the last minute!

Ask us plenty of questions. While every eﬀort has been made for the specs to be reasonable and for
the design pro ject to be well described, there might be residual ambiguities. The ﬁrst line of advice is
the TA’s . After that, don’t hesitate to approach the recitation instructors and the lecturer.
