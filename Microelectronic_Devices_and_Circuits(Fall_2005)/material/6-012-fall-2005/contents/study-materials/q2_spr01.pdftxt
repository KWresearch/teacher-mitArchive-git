General   guidelines   (please  read  carefully  before  starting): 

•	 Make  sure  to  write  your  name  on  the  space  designated  above. 
•	 Open   book:  you  can  use  any material  you  wish. 
•	 All  answers  should  be  given  in  the  space  provided.  Please  do  not  turn  in  any  extra material. 
If  you  need more  space,  use  the  back  page. 
•	 You  have  120   minutes   to  complete  your  quiz. 
•	 Make  reasonable  approximations  and  state  them,  i.e.  quasi-neutrality,  depletion  approxima-
tion,  etc. 
•	 Partial  credit  will  be  given  for  setting  up  problems  without  calculations.  NO   credit will  be 
given  for  answers without  reasons. 
•	 Use  the  symbols  utilized  in  class  for  the  various  physical  parameters,  i.e.  µn ,  ID ,  E , etc. 
•	 Every  numerical  answer must  have  the  proper  units  next  to  it.  Points  will  be  subtracted  for 
answers without  units  or with  wrong  units. 
•	 Use  φ = 0  at  no  = po  = ni  as  potential  reference. 
•	 Use the following fundamental constants and physical parameters for silicon and silicon dioxide 
at  room  temperature: 
ni  = 1 ×  1010  cm

kT /q = 0.025  V

q = 1.60 ×  10−19  C

s  = 1.05 ×  10−12  F /cm
