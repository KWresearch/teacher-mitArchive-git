For calculations of: 
Intrinsic voltage gain (“open-circuit,” “unloaded”): Avo = vout/vin, set RL = ∞, Rs = 0 
Intrinsic current gain (“short-circuit”): Aio = iout/iin, set RL = 0, Rs = ∞ 
Intrinsic transconductance: Gmo = iout/vin, set RL = 0, Rs = 0 
Intrinsic transresistance: Rmo = vout/iin, set RL = ∞, Rs = ∞ 
 
To calculate Rin: Rin = vtest/itest (@ input), and connect RL.  
To calculate Rout: Rout = vtest/itest (@output), and connect RS. 
 
* For CE and CS configurations, Rin is independent of RL, and Rout independent of RS.
