General   guidelines   (please  read  carefully  before  starting): 

•	 Make  sure  to  write  your  name  on  the  space  designated  above. 
•	 Open   book:  you  can  use  any material  you  wish. 
•	 All  answers  should  be  given  in  the  space  provided.  Please  do  not  turn  in  any  extra material. 
If  you  need more  space,  use  the  back  page. 
•	 You  have  180   minutes   to  complete  your  exam. 
•	 Unless  stated  otherwise,  assume  room  temperature. 
•	 Make  reasonable  approximations  and  state  them,  i.e.  quasi-neutrality,  depletion  approxima-
tion,  etc. 
•	 Partial  credit  will  be  given  for  setting  up  problems  without  calculations.  NO   credit  will  be 
given  for  answers without  reasons. 
•	 Use  the  symbols  utilized  in  class  for  the  various  physical  parameters,  i.e.  µn ,  ID ,  E , etc. 
•	 Every  numerical  answer must  have  the  proper  units  next  to  it.  Points  will  be  subtracted  for 
answers without  units  or with  wrong  units. 
•	 Use  φ = 0  at  no  = po  = ni  as  potential  reference. 
•	 Use the following fundamental constants and physical parameters for silicon and silicon dioxide 
at  room  temperature: 
ni  = 1 × 1010  cm

kT /q = 0.025  V

q = 1.60 × 10−19  C

s  = 1.05 × 10−12  F /cm

In  this  table,  when  changing  one  of  the  device  parameters,  adjustments  are made  to  VGG ,  the  gate 
bias,  so  that  none  of  the  other  parameters  are  aﬀected. 

In  this problem,  you have  to  ﬁll  the  fourth  column  of  this  table  that  contains  the  3dB bandwidth  of 
the  ampliﬁer.  Use  the  same  format as  in  the  rest of  the  table and  indicate  in what direction ωH  will 
change  when  the  device  parameters  increase  one  at  a  time.  Nothing  else  changes,  except  perhaps 
for  VGG   as  explained  above.  In  the  space  below,  provide  an  explanation  for  your  entry.  If  there  is 
no  explanation,  there  are  no  points! 

(4a)  (3   points)   If  ISU  P   ↑, how  does  ωH  change?  Select:  ↑,  −,  ↓. Why? 

(4b)  (3   points)   If W  ↑, how  does  ωH  change?  Select:  ↑,  −,  ↓. Why?

(4d)  (3   points)   If  L ↑, how  does  ωH  change?  Select:  ↑,  −,  ↓. Why?

does  ωH  change?  Select:  ↑,  −,  ↓. Why?

(5b)  (5   points)   Calculate  the  loaded  voltage  gain  of  the  entire  CMOS  ampliﬁer  (don’t  be  alarmed  if 
it  comes  out  a  bit  small,  this  is  not  a  very  good  ampliﬁer). 

(5c)  (15   points)   Estimate  the  3  dB  bandwidth  of  the  entire  CMOS  ampliﬁer  (that  is,  in  its  loaded 
conﬁguration).  To  do  this,  calculate  the  time  constant of  each  capacitor at  a  time  (six   capacitors   at  
2  points  each).  Then  compute  the  3  dB  bandwidth  in  Hz   (3   points).
