Please  write   your  recitation  session  time  on  your  problem  set  solution. 

1.  [30  points]  Below  is  a  sketch  not  to  scale   of  the  minority  carrier  distribution  across  the 
quasi­neutral  regions   of  a  forward­biased  p­n  diode.   For  this  diode,   Wp  − xp  = 10  µm, 
Wn  − xn  = 10  µm,  Dn  = 25  cm2/s,   and  Dp  = 10  cm2/s.   The  area  of  the  junction   is  5  µm .

a)  Calculate   the   hole   current  injected  into  the  n­side  of  the  diode. 


b)  Calculate  the  electron   current  injected  into  the  p­side   of  the  diode. 


c)  Calculate   the  diﬀusion  capacitance  associated  with  carrier  storage  on  the  n­side  of  the

diode. 

d)  Calculate  the  diﬀusion   capacitance  associated  with   carrier   storage   on   the  p­side  of  the 
diode. 

e)  How  much  should  the  voltage  across  the  junction  increase   if  we   wish   to   double  the  total 
current  through  the  diode?  

f )   If   we   increase  the  voltage  in  the  manner  suggested  in  the  previous  question,  what  happens 
to  the  total  diﬀusion  capacitance  of  the   diode?

g)  What   is  the   ratio  of  the  doping  levels  across  the  junction:   Na/Nd? 

h)  In  what   direction   should  Na/Nd  change  if  we  wish  to  redesign   the  diode  so  as  to  get 
less   diﬀusion  capacitance  at  the   same   current  level?  (Assume   that   in   redesigning  the 
diode   Dn ,  Dp ,  Wn  − xn ,  and  Wp  − xp  do  not  change). 
Choose  one:   Na/Nd  must  increase.   Na/Nd  must  decrease.  Explain. 

2.  [20  points]  The  equivalent  circuit  of  a  p+ ­n  diode  that  you  are   trying  to  reverse   engineer  
is  measured  at  room  temperature  for  two  diﬀerent  bias   points,  one   forward  (I   = 1  mA) and 
another  one  reverse   (V  =  −10  V  ).  The  results  are  sketched  below:

V=-10 V 

Based  on  your  understanding  of  the   technology  that  has  been  used,   you  are  pretty  sure 
that   you  can  assume  that   the  diode  is  very  abrupt  (that  is  Na  � Nd ) and  that  all  minority 
carrier  behavior   is  dominated   by   the  lowly­doped  side.  On  the   microscope,  you  measure 
the  area  of   the  diode  and   you   ﬁnd   it  to  be   10  µm .

a)  Estimate  the  doping  level  on  the  n  side,  Nd . 

b)  Estimate   the  thickness  of  the  n   region,  Wn . 

c)  Verify   whatever   assumptions  you  needed  to  make. 

3.  [50  points]  Design  a  family   of  Asymmetric  Inverters 

As  an  additional  step  towards  the   6.012  design   pro ject,   in  this  problem  you  will   simulate 
the  dynamic  behaviour  of   the  CMOS   inverter.  After  this   homework  assignment  you  will 
have  all  of  the  skills  necessary   to  focus  on   the   design  of  the   pro ject  and  use  Cadence  to  the 
utmost. 

CMOS  standard   cells  are  collections  of  diﬀerent   types  (inverter,   NAND,   DFF  etc.)   and  sizes 
of  CMOS  gates.  Diﬀerent   sizes  of  gates  are  designed  to  drive  diﬀerent   sizes  of  capacitive 
loads  with  some  nominal  delay   and   rise   time.   In  this  homework  we  will  extend  the   design  of

our  asymmetric  inverter  from  the  last  homework  into  a  family  of  inverters  designed  to  drive 
three  diﬀerent  sizes   of   capacitive  load  (50  f F  ,  150  f F  ,  500  f F  )  with  the   same   maximum 
delay  (400  ps). 

Design  a  family   of   CMOS  inverters.   The   DC  behaviour  must  satisfy  the  following.  The 
input  range   is  0  to  3.3  V  .  The  output  range  is  0  to  5  V  .  The  DC  transfer  function  must  
have  an  output  equal  to  2.5  V  when  the  input  equals  1.65  V  .  The   transient  behaviour   is   as  
follows. For  an  input  signal  of  a  1  M H z   square  wave   with  rise  and  fall  times  of  1  ns,  the 
delay  (rising  or  falling)  must   be   smaller  than  400  ps.   Design  to  obtain   minimum  power. 

In  the  last  homework  you  designed  an  inverter   that  operated  with  an  input  from  0  to 
3.3  V  and  an  output   from  0  to  5  V  .  Start  from  an   inverter  (Wp  = 3  µm,   Lp  = 1.5  µm, 
Wn  = 12.5 µm  and  Ln  = 1.5 µm) which   is  designed  so  that  Vout  = 2.5 V  when  Vin  = 1.65  V  . 

Use  Vdd  = 5  V  .  Use  the  device  models   from  the  Cadence   Tutorial.  The   minimum   and 
maximum  lengths  are  1.5  µm  and  100  µm  with  a  0.5  µm  stepsize.   The  minimum   and  
maximum  widths  are  3.0  µm  and  100  µm  with  a  0.5  µm  stepsize.  

a)  [30  points]  Describe   a  procedure  in  Cadence   that  allows  you  to  size  an  inverter  (Wp,  Lp , 
Wn ,  Ln )  so  that   given  a  load   capacitance  CL  and   an  input  rise  or   fall  time   of  1  ns 
you  achieve   a  maximum   delay   through  the  inverter  of  400  ps  or  less  and  minimum 
power. 
Hint:  Think  about   how  you  can   change  the   delay  of  the  inverter   when   the   CL  changes 
without  changing  the  VM  of  the  inverter. 

b)  [10  points]  Use  your   method  to  ﬁll   in   the   following  table.

tP LH

150  f F  
500  f F

Be  sure   to  check   that   your  inverter  still   has  an  output  equal   to  2.5  V  when  its  input  
is  1.65  V  . 

c)  [10  points]  Provide   plots  showing  P ower,  tP H L ,  tP LH   to  back  up   your  claims.
