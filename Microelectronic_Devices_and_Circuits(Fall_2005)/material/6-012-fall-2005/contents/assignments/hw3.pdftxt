Please write your recitation session time on your problem set solution.

[30 points] In a certain region of an n-type semiconductor in thermal equilibrium at
1.
room temperature, there is an electric ﬁeld distribution in space as sketched below.

E (V/cm)

1200

for 0 < x < 1 µm:
E = 600{1 + cos[104π (2x − 10−4)]} V /cm with x in cm

everywhere else:
E = 0

0

0

0.5

1

x (µm)

a) [10 points] Derive an analytical expression and sketch the electrostatic potential distri-
bution in this region.

b) [10 points] Derive an analytical expression and sketch the net volume charge density in
this region.

c) [10 points] If you are told that the equilibrium electron concentration at x = 0 is no =
1017 cm−3 , compute the equilibrium electron concentration at x = 1 µm?

2. [20 points] A device design engineer in a group incharged of developing a very aggressive
Si npn bipolar process becomes concerned with the suitability of the company’s device
simulation tools to do the job. She argues that in an eﬀort to push the frequency response
of the transistor, the base might become so thin, that perhaps carriers could cross it without

signiﬁcant scattering. In this case, a device CAD tool that incorporates “ballistic” transport
would be required. The group is considering using a p-type base with a doping level of about
1018 cm−3 . The tentative base thickness is 50 nm.

Address the engineer’s concerns by:

a) [10 points] evaluating the mean free path of electrons across the base, and comparing it
with the base width;

b) [10 points] evaluating the ratio of the transit time for electron diﬀusion across the base
(given by Eq. 7.71 in Howe & Sodini, we will talk about it when we discuss the
bipolar transistor) over the electron scattering time in the base.

For this problem, you need the electron ”eﬀective mass” in Si, which is mn = 1.6× 10−16 eV ·
s2/cm2 (such are the units of mass in the strange system of units followed in the semicon-
ductor engineering world!)

3. [40 points] Consider an abrupt pn junction with Nd = 1017 cm−3 and Na = 1016 cm−3,
as sketched below.

a) (10 points) Compute the value of the electrostatic potential at x = 0 in thermal equi-
librium.

b) (10 points) Compute no and po at x = 0 in thermal equilibrium.

c) (10 points) Compute the value of x for which no = po = ni in thermal equilibrium.

d) (10 points) Compute the total amount of charge per unit area on the p side of the
junction when a reverse bias voltage of 5 V is applied to the diode.

4. [10 points] I-V characteristics of pn diode (cont.)

This problem continues the pn diode characterization exercises of homeworks #1 and #2.
In this homework you examine to what extent the ideal-looking portion of the forward
branch of the current-voltage characteristics of the diode follows the Boltzmann law.

As you know, the ideal I-V characteristics of a pn diode has an equation:

I = Is (exp qV
kT

− 1)

Under suﬃcient forward bias, this equation can be simpliﬁed to:

I ' Is exp qV
kT

Notice that this equation looks a lot like the Boltzmann relation for electrons derived in
lecture:

no = ni exp qφ
kT

In the discussion around the Boltzmann relation in lecture, we derived the ”60 mV rule”.
This states that at 300 K and in thermal equilibrium, every change in the electron con-
centration in a decade (factor of 10) brings along a change in the electrostatic potential of
about 60 mV. In lecture, we showed that, remarkably, the current through a pn diode in
the ideal-looking portion of the forward branch behaves in a similar way: every increase of
60 mV brings along an increase in the current of a factor of 10x (provided that the diode
sits at around 300 K). This is a direct manifestation of Boltzmann law right out of your
instrument! This simple exercise is about demonstrating experimentally that this is indeed
the case in a more rigorous way than it was done in class.

What you have to do is to measure the I-V characteristics of the pn diode, or recycle the
data that you acquired for homework #1, and compute the slope (it should perhaps be
called ”inverse slope” but it is usually referred to simply as the slope) of the ideal forward
branch in units of V/dec (”volts per decade of current”). You can do this in two ways:

• One way is to work with the downloaded data and write a piece of code in MATLAB,
EXCEL, or your favorite mathematical program and derive this slope point by point
for all points of the forward branch of the pn diode.

• Another way (faster!) is to take advantage of the user deﬁned functions of the Mi-
croelectronics WebLab and have the instrument do the computation for you. You
can then graph the results in the right-hand y axis of the WebLab canvas and simply
print out this graph.

In either case, you have to come up with a simple mathematical algorithm to obtain this
slope.

You have to turn in:

• A description of the mathematical algorithm that allows you to obtain the slope of
the forward branch of the diode in units of V/dec.
• A graph showing the slope of the forward branch of the pn diode currently placed
in WebLab as a function of V . In the same graph or in a separate graph, plot the
semilog I-V characteristics of the diode.
• A brief discussion of the range of V for which a Boltzmann-like behavior is observed
in the diode.

If you decide to have WebLab do the computation of the slope for you, you should read
about the user deﬁned functions in Section 1.6 and Appendix A of the WebLab manual
(accessible from the Applet launch page in http://ilab.mit.edu).
