Please  write   your  recitation  session  time  on  your  problem  set  solution. 

1.  [20  points]  Consider  a  p­type  Si  sample  with  a  resistivity  of  2  Ω.cm  at  300  K.  At  300K, 
estimate  the  magnitude  of: 

1a.  [5  points]   Hole   concentration,  po .

State  whatever  assumptions   you  need  to  make.  

2.  [20  points]  Consider   a  sample  prepared  from  the  same  material   as  in  problem  1.  This 
sample  is   at  300K.  The  geometry   of  the   sample  is  such  that  it  can  be  considered  a  one­
dimensional  situation.  At  a  certain  location   in  this  sample,  we   measure  a  drift  current 
density   of  104  A/cm2 .

4.  [40  points]  I­V  characteristics  of  pn  diode  (cont.) 

This  exercise  continues  the  pn  diode  characterization  problem  of  homework  #1.  It  utilizes  
the  data  for   the  current­voltage  characteristics  for  a  pn  diode  that  you   obtained  through  the 
MIT  Microelectronics   WebLab  last  week.  In  this   exercise,   your  task  is  to  derive  a  simple 
equivalent  circuit   model  for  this  pn   diode.  You  should  study  Appendix  A  at  the  end  of  this  
package. 

Do  the  following: 

4a)  (10  points)   Study  the  ideal  model  for  the   I­V   characteristics  of  the   pn  diode  in  Ap­
pendix  A.  Devise   a  simple  scheme  to  extract  from  the  measured  data  the   saturation 
current,  Is  (in  A) and  the  temperature  of  the  diode,   T  (in   K ).  Illustrate  your  proce­
dure   graphically   and  give  the   extracted  values.   Give   a  higher  weight  to  estimations  of 

Is  that  come  from  the  ideal  looking  portion  of  the  forward  branch  of  the   I­V  character­
istics  where  the  accuracy  of  the  model  is  most   important.  Compare  the   temperature 
that   you  extract  with  the  temperature   of  the   lab  as  measured   by  WebLab.   Comment 
on  discrepancies. 

4b)  (10  points) Compare  the  experimental  I­V  characteristics  with   those  predicted  by  the 
ideal  theoretical  model  by  graphing  them  together.   For  this,   you   will   need  to  use 
MATLAB,  a  spreadsheet  program,  or  some   other  mathematical   program  with  graph­
ing  capabilities. 
Turn  in  the   following  graphs:  

in  x  axis  in  linear  scale,  I  in   y  axis 
graph  1:  Linear   plot  of  I­V  characteristics  (V 
in  linear  scale).  Show  experimental  data  points   with   symbols  and  ideal   model 
with  continuous  line.   Print  out  this  graph.  
graph  2:  Semilogarithmic  plot  of  I­V   characteristics  (V  in   x  axis  in  linear  scale,  I  in 
y  axis   in  logarithmic  scale).  Show  experimental  data  points  with  symbols  and 
ideal  model  with  continuous  line.   Print  out   this  graph. 

4c)  (10  points) A more  realistic  model   for  a  pn  diode   includes  a  parasitic  series  resistance,  as 
discussed   in   Appendix  A.  Using  the  values  of  Is  and   T  derived  in  the  previous  section, 
devise  a  simple   scheme  to  extract  from  the  measured   data  the  series  resistance,   Rs  (in 
Ω),  of   the  diode.  Illustrate  your   procedure   graphically  and   give   the  extracted  value. 

4d)  (10  points) Compare  the  experimental  characteristics  with  those  predicted  by  the  the­
oretical  model  by   graphing  them  together.   Plotting   the  I­V   characteristics   of  the 
model  that  includes   series  resistance  is  a  bit  tricky  because   I  is  on  both  sides  of  the 
equation.   A  good  way   to  do  it  is  to  solve   for  V  ,  then  compute  V  vs.  I ,  and  ﬁnally 
plot  I  vs.  V  . 
Turn  in  the   following  graphs: 

graph  3:  Linear   plot  of  I­V  characteristics  (V 
in   x  axis  in   linear  scale,  I  in   y  axis 
in  linear   scale).  Show  experimental  data  points  with   symbols  and   second­order 
model  with  continuous  line.  Print  out  this   graph. 
graph  4:  Semilogarithmic  plot  of  I­V  characteristics  (V   in  x  axis  in  linear  scale,  I  in 
y  axis   in  logarithmic  scale).  Show  experimental  data  points  with  symbols  and 
second­order   model  with  continuous   line.   Print  out  this  graph. 

Turn   in  these  four   graphs   and  comment  on  how  the   measured  I­V  characteristics  of  the 
diode   compare   with   those  that  you  studied   in  6.002.  

The   required  graphs   need  not   be  too  fancy,   just   simply  correct  and  unambigous.   They  must 
have  proper  tickmarks,  axis  labelling,  and  correct  units.  

Appendix  A:  DC  I­V  characteristics   of  pn  diode 

Ideal  model 

The  ideal  I­V  characteristics   of  a  pn  diode  are   given   by:  
� 
� 
− 1
I  =  Is  exp  

qV  
kT  

where  Is  is  the   saturation  current,   q  is  the   electron  charge  (in  this  expression,   q  = 1  e  ,where 
e  stands  for  electron,   and  NOT  q  = 1.6 × 10−19  C ),  T  is  the  temperature  (in   K ),  and  K  is 
Boltzmann  constant  (K  = 8.62  × 10−5  eV /K ). 

Second­order  model 

”Real”  diodes   suﬀer  from  a  number  of  parasitics.   One   of  the  most  important  ones  is  the 
presence   of   parasitic  series  resistance,   Rs.  This  reduces  the  voltage  that  is  available  to 
the  junction  from  an  external  one  V  to  an  internal   one  V  − I Rs .  Hence,  the  DC  I­V 
characteristics  of  the  diode  are  given  by:  
�

I  =  Is  exp

q (V  − I Rs )

The  I­V  characteristics  predicted   by   both   models   look   as  in   the  graphs  below.
