Please write your recitation session time on your problem set solution.

1. [60 points] A Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chip is composed of many cells
that hold individual bits of information. For example, a 4 MB DRAM has about 4 × 106
cells where information can be held. At the heart of one of these cells is a capacitor that
stores electrical charge. If the capacitor is charged, then we say that a ”1” is stored. If
the capacitor is discharged, then a ”0” is stored. The smaller the capacitor, the denser the
memory chip can be made. Achieving denser DRAM chips has been for the better part of
the last 30 years a powerful technology driver for microelectronics, bringing along with it
staggering progress in microprocessors and many other microelectronic products.

For a long time, the minimum feature size, or minimum dimension that can be reliably fab-
ricated on a Si wafer, has been the bottleneck to high-density DRAM development. This is
because the storage capacitor area is directly related to the minimum feature dimensions. As
technology progressed and the minimum features size decreased, DRAM density increased.
In the mid 90’s, however, the situation changed dramatically. Rather than feature size,
dielectric breakdown became a limiting phenomenom. This problem explores these issues.

This problem is designed to accomplish two goals:

1. to make you understand a few key issues in DRAM development: evolution, critical
dimensions, limiting factors;

2. to make you review basic capacitor facts: charge, capacitance, ﬁeld.

To a reasonable good approximation, a DRAM capacitor is basically a parallel plate capac-
itor where the insulator is made out of SiO2 and the plates are made out of heavily-doped
polycristalline Si. This, for all purposes, can be thought of as a metal, as you will come to
understand soon in 6.012.

1. [5 points] Consider for a moment a 10 µm2 area capacitor with a 30 nm thick SiO2
dielectric. Compute the capacitance. The dielectric constant of SiO2 is 3.9.

2. [15 points] With 4 V applied across this capacitor, quantitatively sketch the charge
distribution, electric ﬁeld, and electrostatic potential across the capacitor from plate
to plate.

3. [25 points] Let’s now look at the evolution of DRAMs. The following table contains the
DRAM generation (4M, for example, means a DRAM with about four million bits),
the year in which volume production started, and the minimum feature size used in
that generation:

Prepare a spreadsheet in which you compute the following items:

3a. [5 points] The cel l area, Ac . This all-important parameter is intimately related
to the minimum feature size. One cannot make a cell as small as the square of
the minimum feature size. This is because in addition to the capacitor, there
is a transistor, and interconnects in between. A historical average number for
a parallel plate capacitor DRAM cell considered here is that the cell area is
16 times the square of the minimum feature size. One can call this factor of
16 a ”cleverness factor” (the smaller it is, the more clever you are). Using a
given feature size, the smarter you are in laying out and fabricating the cell, the

smaller it is going to be. Recent years have seen quite an improvement in this
factor. In this problem, we will use a historical average value of 16.
3b. [5 points] The capacitor storage area, As . On average, for a parallel-plate capac-
itor DRAM cell, the capacitor area is about half of the cell area.
3c. [5 points] The chip area, Ach . The chip also contains a lot more than just cells.
It has, for example, busses, sense ampliﬁers, and input/output pads. So, to ﬁrst
order, the chip area is double the area of all cells combined.
3d. [5 points] The SiO2 thickness, tox . For reasons of signal-to-noise ratio, the ca-
pacitance of DRAM cells has been essentially constant across generations. An
average value is 40 fF. Based on this capacitance, compute the oxide thickness
that each generation requires.
3e. [5 points] The electric ﬁeld inside the insulator, Eox . Do this for two operating
voltages, 5 V and 3.3 V . Consider that the actual voltage that is applied across
the capacitor when a ”1” is stored is 1 V smaller than the operating voltage.
Do the calculation then for 4 V and 2.3 V .

4. [5 points] The maximum ﬁeld that a material can withstand is called the dielectric
strength, Ebr . For SiO2 , this ﬁeld is 107 V /cm. If you exceed this value, dielectric
breakdown takes place which results in lightning inside your capacitor! This is bad
news for the cell. Based on your results, what is the densest DRAM generation that
a parallel plate capacitor approach can produce for 5 V operation? How about 3.3 V
operation?

5. [5 points] So, how to beat this limit? One approach that was investigated consisted of
using an insulator with a higher dielectric constant. One that received considerable
attention was Ta2O5 . This material has a relative dielectric constant of 18 and a
dielectric strength of 6 M V /cm. Rerun your spreadsheet for Ta2O5 . What is now
the densest DRAM generation that a parallel plate capacitor approach using Ta2O5
can produce for 5 V operation? How about 3.3 V operation?

6. [5 points] To even go beyond, one really has to make capacitors with an eﬀective area that
is bigger than the cell area. One can accomplish this by stacking smaller capacitors
on top of each other, in what is known as a 3D design. Another way is to roughen up
the surface of the plates to increase their eﬀective area. Yet a third way is to bury
the capacitor sideways into a trench that has been dug into the wafer. These trenches
can be quite deep, as much as 10 µm. In all cases, you get a capacitor area that is
bigger than the cell area.
To see what this approach entails, keeping the cell area as above, compute the capac-
itor area that makes possible a 1 Gb DRAM cell to operate at 3.3 V without suﬀering
from dielectric breakdown. Consider both SiO2 and Ta2O5 dielectrics.

2. [40 points] I-V characteristics of pn diode

Most of the homeworks in 6.012 this semester will include a small device characterization
pro ject. The goal of these pro jects is to expose students to real microelectronics devices:
current-voltage characteristics, parameter extraction techniques, and model construction.
These pro jects use the MIT Microelectronics WebLab, an online microelectronics device
characterization test station that Prof. del Alamo and his students have been developing for
a while in his lab at MIT. WebLab allows the educational use of professional microelectronics
instrumentation by a large number of users through the internet.

Access to WebLab is provided through the MIT iLab Service Broker available at
http://ilab.mit.edu. Your ﬁrst step is to register by clicking on the ”register here” tab.
Then select admission in the
group. Registration is not au-
"OpenCourseWare Users"
tomatic but actually must be approved by the system manager. This typically takes less
than a day but could take a few hours. You should therefore register early. Your one-stop
shopping location for help, of any kind, regarding this assignment is through the ”Help” tab
in the iLab website. The WebLab team welcomes your feedback at <ilab-debug@mit.edu>.
A manual for the use of this system is accessible from this site after logging in.

Engineers working at the cutting edge often use state-of-the-art design and simulation tools
in their work. This is worthwhile even if it means dealing with a few bugs, small annoyances,
and less than optimal documentation. WebLab 6.1 and the MIT iLab Service Broker are
the latest generation in online microelectronic device characterization. In spite of extensive
development and testing, it is possible that a few bugs remain. As engineers working at the
state-of-the-art, you should approach this pro ject in a conservative way and carry out your
assignment as early as possible. You should also seek help if you ﬁnd any diﬃculties.

In the device characterization assignments of 6.012, you will use an Agilent 4155B Semicon-
ductor Parameter Analyzer. This professional tool allows you to obtain the current-voltage
(I-V) characteristics of semiconductor devices.

In this ﬁrst assignment, your task is to obtain, download and graph the I-V characteristics
of a pn diode.
In a follow-on assignment, you will attempt to ﬁt a simple model to the
measured characteristics. The pn diode is a device which basic behavior you have already
studied in 6.002. One or more identical devices (labelled pn Diode) are available in WebLab
under the Devices menu. The details of the device connection are available on-line. Do the
following:

1) (20 points) Obtain I-V characteristics of the pn diode. Take measurements between
-2 and 1 V. In the measurement results panel of WebLab, graph your results in the
following way:

graph 1: Linear plot of I-V characteristics (V in x axis in linear scale, I in y axis in

linear scale). Take a screen shot and print this graph. Turn in this graph.
graph 2: Semilogarithmic plot of I-V characteristics (V in x axis in linear scale, I
in y axis in logarithmic scale). Note: in a logarithmic scale, weblab graphs the
absolute of negative currents. Take a screen shot and print this graph. Turn in
this graph.

You might need to go back and forth a few times trying diﬀerent measurement point
distributions so that suﬃcient data is taken in all regions of interest. Think also about
issues involved in sweeping voltage vs. sweeping current. The maximum current the
Agilent 4155B can support is 100 mA so for high voltages, the diode current will be
clamped to 100 mA. The minimum current you should be concerned with is 1 pA.

2) (20 points) When you are happy with the results, download the data to your local
machine and port them into your favorite spreadsheet program or MATLAB for
graphing and analysis. Then do the following:

graph 3: Linear plot of I-V characteristics (V in x axis in linear scale, I in y axis in
linear scale). Print out and turn in this graph.
graph 4: Semilogarithmic plot of I-V characteristics (V in x axis in linear scale, I in
y axis in logarithmic scale). Note: in your spreadsheet program, you will have
to compute the absolute of the current before you can graph it in a logarithmic
scale. Print out and turn in this graph.

Turn in these four graphs and comment on how the measured I-V characteristics of the
diode compare with those that you studied in 6.002.

Keep all the data handy as you will need them in a follow-on assignment in the next
homework.

Additional information and assorted advice

• The required graphs 3 and 4 need not be too fancy, just simply correct and unam-
bigous. They must have proper tickmarks, axis labelling, and correct units.
• You have to exercise care with this device. Please do not apply a higher voltage than
suggested. The pn diode is real and it can be damaged. If the characteristics look
funny, try one of the other devices and let us know.
• It will be to your advantage to make good use of the Set-up management functions
that are built into the tool under the File menu.
• For research purposes, the system keeps a record of all logins and all scripts that each
user executes.
