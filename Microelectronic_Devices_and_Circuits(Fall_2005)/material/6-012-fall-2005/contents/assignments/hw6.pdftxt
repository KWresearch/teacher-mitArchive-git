Please write your recitation session time on your problem set solution.

1. [20 points] Consider an n-channel MOSFET in the saturation regime.

a) Derive expressions and sketch the spatial dependence of Vc (y ), Ey (y ), vn (y ), and Qn (y )
from source to drain. Explain your results.

b) Obtain an expression for the transit time of electrons through the channel from source
to drain by computing:
dt = Z L
τt = Z L
0
0

dy
vn (y )

2. [35 points] Consider a MOSFET that consists of a n+ -poly Si gate, a 55 ˚A silicon dioxide
dielectric on a NA = 3 × 1017 cm−3 p-type substrate. The gate length is 0.5 µm and the
gate width is 2 µm. The inversion layer mobility is 700 cm2/V .s.

Derive a complete high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit model for this transistor
for VGS = 2 V, VDS = 4 V, and VSB = 1 V. The source and drain junction areas are 6 µm2
each. The overlap capacitance is 0.2 fF/µm. Assume that λ = 0.05 V −1 . Do not disregard
substrate eﬀects. CJ SW = 0.

3. [45 points] MOSFET characterization (cont.)

This is a continuation of the MOSFET characterization pro ject started last week. For the
work to be performed here, you should use the data downloaded during the last assignment.
You may acquire the data again if you wish or if you cannot ﬁnd it.

In this part of the pro ject, you are to model the I-V characteristics of the 3 µm MOSFET
using the ideal MOSFET model and the parameters that you extracted last time and
compare them with the measured characteristics.

Important note: For all mesurements, hold VGS between 0 and 2 V , and VDS between 0
and 4 V . Unless speciﬁed, use VBS = 0 V . When relevant, examine VBS between 0 and
−3 V . As inputs to this exercise, you need the dimensions of the MOSFET: L = 3 µm and
W = 20 µm.

Here is your assignment.

1. (5 points) On your local machine, using Matlab or your favorite spreadsheet program,
graph the measured output characteristics of the MOSFET. This is a plot of ID vs.
VDS with VGS as parameter. Do this for VBS = 0 V .

Graph 1: Linear plot of output characteristics (VDS in x axis in linear scale, ID in
y axis in linear scale). Print this graph. Turn in this graph.

2. (5 points) On your local machine, graph the measured transfer characteristics of the
MOSFET. This is a plot of ID vs. VGS with VDS as parameter. Do this for VBS = 0 V .

Graph 2: Linear plot of transfer characteristics (VGS in x axis in linear scale, ID in
y axis in linear scale). Print this graph. Turn in this graph.

3. (5 points) On your local machine, graph the measured backgate characteristics of
the MOSFET in the saturation regime. This is a plot of ID vs. VGS with VBS as
parameter. Do this for VDS = 4 V .

Graph 3: Linear plot of backgate characteristics (VGS in x axis in linear scale, ID
in y axis in linear scale). Print this graph. Turn in this graph.

4. (30 points) Using the parameter that you have extracted, ”play back” the I-V charac-
teristics of the transistors and compare them with the measurement data. The most
eﬀective way to do this is to program the model in matlab or your favorite spreadsheet
program and construct graphs that depict the measured data as individual dots and
the model as continuous lines.

Graph 4: Graph together the measured output characteristics of the MOSFET and
those predicted from the model. Print this graph. Turn in this graph. Comment
on the accuracy of the model.
Graph 5: Graph together the measured transfer characteristics of the MOSFET and
those predicted by the model. Print this graph. Turn in this graph. Comment
on the accuracy of the model.
Graph 6: Graph together the measured backgate characteristics of the MOSFET in
the saturation regime and those predicted by the model. Print this graph. Turn
in this graph. Comment on the accuracy of the model.
