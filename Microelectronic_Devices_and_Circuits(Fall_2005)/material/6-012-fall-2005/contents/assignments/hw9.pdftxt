[30 points] The ﬁgure below shows six possible ways of connecting an npn bipolar

calculate the I-V characteristics of the two-terminal device in each conﬁguration. Express
your result as a function of IS , βF , and βR .

2. [20 points] Problem P8.10 of Howe & Sodini. Don’t do (e). Do instead:

e) Calculate the maximum amplitude of a sinusoidal signal signal applied to the input so
that the output waveform does not clip. What makes the output waveform clip if
this maximum signal is exceeded?

3. [50 points] I-V characteristics of npn Bipolar Junction Transistor

In this problem, you will characterize the current-voltage characteristics of an npn bipolar
junction transistor through WebLab. This exercise involves three separate phases: (i)
measurement and graphing, (ii) SPICE model parameter extraction, and (iii) comparison
of SPICE model with measurements. Take the measurements speciﬁed below. When you
are happy with the results, download the data to your local machine for more graphing and
further analysis.

Important note: For all mesurements, hold VBE (or VBC ) between 0 and 0.9 V , and VCE
between 0 and ±4 V .

Here is your assignment.

1. (5 points) Measure and download the common-emitter output characteristics of the
BJT. This is a plot of IC (linear scale) vs. VCE (linear scale) with IB as parameter,
for positive VCE . Do this for 0 ≤ VCE ≤ 4 V and 0 ≤ IB ≤ 100 µA with ∆IB =
20 µA. In your local machine and using your favorite software tool, graph the output
characteristics. Turn in a printout of this graph (graph 1).

2. (5 points) Measure and download the common-emitter transfer characteristics of the
BJT in the forward active regime (also known as Gummel plot). This is a semilog plot
of IC and IB (logarithmic scale) vs. VBE (linear scale). Do this for VCE = 2.5 V . In
your local machine graph the Gummel plot. Turn in a printout of this graph (graph
2).

3. (5 points) Measure and download the reverse common-emitter output characteristics
of the BJT. This is a plot of IC (linear scale) vs. VCE (linear scale) with IB as
parameter, for negative VCE . Do this for −4 ≤ VCE ≤ 0 V and 0 ≤ IB ≤ 100 µA
with ∆IB = 20 µA. In your local machine graph the reverse output characteristics.
Turn in a printout of this graph (graph 3).

4. (5 points) Measure and download the reverse common-emitter transfer characteris-
tics of the BJT (also known as reverse Gummel plot). This is a plot of IE and IB
(logarithmic scale) vs. VBC (linear scale). Do this for VEC = 2.5 V . In your local
machine graph the reverse Gummel plot. Turn in a printout of this graph (graph
4).

5. (6 points) From the forward and reverse Gummel plots, extract VBE on and VBC on ,
respectively. Deﬁne these voltages as the values of VBE and VBC that yield IB =
10 µA. Derive VCE sat = VBE on − VBC on .
6. (4 points) From the forward and reverse Gummel plots, extract the SPICE parameters
IS, BF and BR.

7. (20 points) Using the SPICE parameter set just derived, play back the characteristics
of the BJT and compare them with the measurement data. Construct the following
graphs that include both measurements and SPICE model calculations. Use individ-
ual dots for the data points and continuous lines for model calculations.

graph 5: Common-emitter output characteristics in forward regime. Print this graph.
graph 6: Gummel plot in forward regime. Print this graph.
graph 7: Common-emitter output characteristics in reverse regime. Print this graph.
graph 8: Gummel plot in reverse regime. Print this graph.

8. (optional) The SPICE model can by reﬁned by accounting for the ﬁnite output con-
ductance of the device. From the forward output characteristics, extract the SPICE
parameter VA.

9. (optional) Replay the common-emitter output characteristics of the device in the
forward regime using the SPICE model set that incorporates VA.

Additional information and assorted advice

• For the SPICE parameter extraction portion of the exercise, there is no need to
use an optimizer or any other fancy software. The ideal model does not match the
experimental characteristics all that well. Simple extraction algorithms that you can
devise should do an adequate job. Make sure the resulting values of the extracted
parameters make physical sense.
• You have to exercise care with these devices. Please do not apply a higher voltage
than suggested. The BJTs are real and they can be damaged. If the characteristics
look funny, try a diﬀerent device and let us know.
• For research purposes, the system keeps a record of all logins and all scripts that each
user executes.
