Homework  #7  ­ October  28,  2005 

Due:  November   4,  2005  at  recitation  ( 2  PM  latest) 
(late  homework   wil l  not  be   accepted) 

Please  write   your  recitation  session  time  on  your  problem  set  solution. 

1.  [20  points]   Problem  E4.19  of  Howe  &  Sodini.   Note   comment  before   exercise  E4.1  in  page 
246  of  Howe  &   Sodini. 

2.  [40  points]   Problem  P5.5   of  Howe   &  Sodini.   Note  comment  before  exercise  E5.1  in  p. 
319  of   Howe   &  Sodini.  Note  also  that  in   some  versions  of  the  book,   there   is  an  error  in  the 
list  of  parameters.  λn  and  λp  should  be  given   by: 

λn  =  λp  = 0.067

with  L  in  µm 

3.  [40  points]  Design  the  DC  transfer  function  of  an  Asymmetric  Inverter 

One   goal  of  design  pro ject   for   6.012  is  to   expose   students  to  the   design   of  integrated  circuits 
using  a  modern  design   tool.  It   highlights  the  diﬀerence  between  design  and  analysis.  The 
pro ject  requires   the  use  of   the  Cadence  suite   of  design  tools.  This  homework  question  gives 
you  an  opportunity  to  conﬁgure   your  Cadence   setup  and   consider  some  of  the  design  issues  
of  the   pro ject  in  advance. 

Modern  digital  chips   run   at  5  V,   3.3  V,  1.8  V,   0.9  V  and  voltages  in  between.   Digital  
CMOS  logic   signals   need  to  be  converted   from  one   voltage  level   to  another  when  you  switch 
operating  voltages.  In   this   question  you   will  design  a  CMOS  inverter  to  convert  from  3.3 
V  to  5  V  operation. To  design  an   inverter  means  to  select  the  Wp,  Lp ,  Wn  and  Ln  of  the 
MOS  devices. 

The  input   signal  of  your   inverter  will   go  from  0  to  3.3  V,   and  the   output  from  0  to  5 
V.  For  the  best  noise  margin  for  the  3.3  V   logic  on  the  input  side  and  the  5  V  logic  on

the  output  side   we  want   the  inverter   designed   so  that  vOU T   = 5  V  × 0.5 =  2.5  V  when 
vI N   = 3.3  V  × 0.5 =  1.65  V  . 

We  are  not  considering  the  loading,  rise/fall  times  or  delay  of  this  inverter.   Design  the 
inverter   so  that   it  is  the  minimum  possible   size.   You  might  want  to  think  about  what  you 
would  have   to  do  to  scale  it   for  a  diﬀerent  load   capacitor.  You   will   be  asked  about  this   in 
next  week’s  homework. 

Use  VDD   = 5  V  .  Use   the   device  models  from  the   Cadence  Tutorial.   The   minimum  and 
maximum  lengths  are  1.5  µm  and   100  µm  with  a  0.5  µm  stepsize.   The  minimum  and 
maximum  widths  are  3  µm  and  100  µm  with  a  0.5  µm  stepsize.  

a)  [30  points]  From  the   Cadence  tutorial  you  know  how  to  use   the  dc  simulation  to  sweep 
the   input  voltage  and  plot  the  dc  transfer  curve.  Describe   a  procedure   using  Cadence 
to  ﬁnd  the   values  of   Wp,  Lp ,  Wn  and  Ln  that  produce   the  desired  inverter. 
Hint:  You  can  sweep  any design   variable  that  you  use   in  the  schematic,   not  just  power 
supplies. 

b)  [5  points]  Use  your   method  and  ﬁnd   the  Wn ,  Ln ,  Wp  and  Lp  that  produce  the  desired 
inverter.  Give  the  design  values  for   the   following  parameters:  

Wp

Lp

Wn

Ln

Sp  =  Wp/Lp

Sn  =  Wn/Ln

Sinv   =  Sp/Sn


c)  [5  points]  Provide  a  plot   of  the   DC  transfer  characteristic   for  your  inverter.   Show  that 
the   VM  point  is  at   vI N   = 1.65  V  and   vOU T   = 2.5  V  .
