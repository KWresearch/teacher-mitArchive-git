Problem set 7 
Due November 16, 2004. Problems from notes:- 61, 62, plus the following two problems 
also at the end of the problems in the notes as numbers 75, 76. 

Restriction from Sobolev spaces. The Sobolev embedding theorem shows that a function 

in 

is continuous - and hence can be restricted to a subspace of 
for 
In fact this works more generally. Show that there is a well defined restriction map 

if 

with the following properties: 

1.  On 
it is given by 
2.  It is continuous and linear. 

Hint: Use the usual method of finding a weak version of the map on smooth Schwartz 
; 
functions namely show that in terms of the Fourier transforms on 
and

Use Cauchy's inequality to show that this is continuous as a map on Sobolev spaces as 

indicated and then the density of

in 

to conclude that the map is well-

Restriction by WF: From class we know that the product of two distributions, one with 
compact support, is defined provided they have no `opposite' directions in their wavefront 
set: 

then
