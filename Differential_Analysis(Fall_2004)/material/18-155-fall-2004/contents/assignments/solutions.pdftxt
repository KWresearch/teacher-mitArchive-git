18.  Solutions  to  (some  of)  the  problems 

Solution  18.1  (To  Problem  10).  (by Matjaˇz  Konvalinka). 
Since  the  topology  on  N,  inherited  from R,  is  discrete,  a  set  is  com­
pact if and only if it is ﬁnite.  If a sequence {xn } (i.e.  a function N � C) 
is  in  C0 (N)  if  and  only  if  for  any  ψ  >  0  there  exists  a  compact  (hence 
ﬁnite)  set  F�  so  that  xn < ψ  for  any  n  not  in  F� . We  can  assume  that 
|
|
F�  =  {1, . . . , n�},  which  gives  us  the  condition  that  {xn}  is  in  C0 (N) 
if  and  only  if  it  converges  to  0.  We  denote  this  space  by  c0 ,  and  the 
supremum  norm  by  � · �0 . A  sequence  {xn}  will  be  abbreviated  to  x. 
Let  l1  denote  the space of (real or complex)  sequences  x with a ﬁnite 
1-norm 
�x�1  = ⎝ 
�
|xn |. 
n=1 
We  can  deﬁne  pointwise  summation  and  multiplication  with  scalars, 
and  (l1 , � · �1 )  is  a  normed  (in  fact  Banach)  space.  Because  the  func­
tional

n=1 
is  a  (linear)  well-deﬁned  mapping  with  norm  at  most  1.  In  fact,  �  is 
an  isometry  because  if 
=  �x�0  then  �(x)(ej ) =  1  where  ej  is
|xj | 
|
|
the  j -th  unit  vector.  We  claim  that  �  is  also  surjective  (and  hence  an 
isometric  isomorphism).  If  χ  is  a  functional  on  c0  let  us  denote  χ(ej ) 
by  xj .  Then  �(x)(y ) =  ⎠�  χ(en )yn  =  ⎠�  χ(ynen ) =  χ(y )  (the

converges  to  y  in  c0  and  χ  is

continuous  with  respect  to  the  topology  in  c0 ),  so  �(x) = χ.

Solution  18.3  (To Problem  40).  (Matjaˇz Konvalinka) Let  us prove  this 
in  the  case  where  n = 1.  Deﬁne  (for  b = 0) 

U (x) = u(b) − u(x) − (b − x)u ≤ (x) − . . . −

(k − 1)! 
For the continuously diﬀerentiable function V (x) = U (x)−(1−x/b)k U (0) 
we have V (0) = V (b) = 0,  so by Rolle’s theorem  there exists ϕ  between 
0  and  b  with 

V ≤ (ϕ ) = U ≤ (ϕ ) + 

k(b − ϕ )k−1 
U (0) = 0 
bk 

Then

U (0) = − k(b − ϕ )k−1 U ≤ (ϕ ), 
u(k−1) (0)

u(b) = u(0) + u ≤ (0)b + . . . +

The  required  decomposition  is  u(x) = p(x) + v (x)  for

for  ϕ  between  0  and  x,  and  since  u(k)  is  continuous,  (u(x) − p(x))/xk 
tends  to  0  as  x  tends  to  0. 
The  proof  for  general  n  is  not much  more  diﬃcult.  Deﬁne  the  func­
tion  wx :  I  �  R  by  wx (t) =  u(tx).  Then  wx  is  k-times  continuously

so  by  above  u(x) = wx (1)  is  the  sum  of  some  polynomial  p  (od  degree

because  the  derivative  is  continuous. 
Solution  18.4  (Solution to Problem 41).  (Matjˇz Konvalinka) Obviously 
the map C0 (Bn ) � C (Bn ) is injective (since it is just the inclusion map), 
and  f  ≤  C (Bn )  is  in  C0 (Bn )  if  and  only  if  it  is  zero  on  ξBn ,  ie.  if  and 
only  if  f |Sn−1  = 0.  It  remains  to  prove  that  any  map  g  on  Sn−1  is  the 
restriction  of  a  continuous  function  on  Bn .  This  is  clear  since 
� x g (x/ x )  x = 0

x = 0 
is  well-deﬁned,  coincides  with  f  on  Sn−1 ,  and  is  continuous:  if  M  is 
the  maximum  of  |g |  on  Sn−1 ,  and  ψ  >  0  is  given,  then  f (x) <  ψ  for
|
|
x < ψ/M .

Solution  18.5.  (partly Matjaˇz  Konvalinka) 
For  any  χ ≤ S (R)  we  have

Thus  S (R) � χ  ⇒−� ⎛ 
χdx  is  continous. 
Now,  choose  α  ≤  C� (R)  with  ⎛

Note  that  the  assumption  on  α means  that 
�  � 
Aφ (x) = −

Clearly  Aφ  is  smooth,  and  in  fact  it  is  a  Schwartz  function  since

so  it  suﬃces  to  show  that  xk Aφ  is  bounded  for  any  k  as  |x| � ±→. 
Since  φ (t) − cα(t) � Ck t−k−1  in  t √ 1  it  follows  from  (18.2)  that 
�  � 
|x k Aφ (x) � C x k

A  similar  estimate  as  x � −→ follows  from  (18.1).  Now,  A  is  clearly 
linear,  and  it  follows  from  the  estimates  above,  including  that  on  the 
integral,  that  for  any  k  there  exists  C  and  j  such  that

Finally  then,  given  u  ≤  S ≤ (R)  deﬁne  v (φ ) =  u(Aφ ).  From  the
−
continuity  of  A,  v  ≤  S (R)  and  from  the  deﬁnition  of  A,  A(φ ≤ ) =  φ . 
Thus

How  to  see  that  this  cannot  be  done  with  n or  less  derivatives?  For

This  cannot  be  improved  to  n from  n + 1  since  this  would  mean  that

more  subtle  than  this.
