parallelogram law holds for every pair 

Hint (From Dimitri Kountourogiannis) 

If 

comes from an inner product, then it must satisfy the polarisation identity: 

i.e, the inner product is recoverable from the norm, so use the RHS (right hand side) to 
define an inner product on the vector space. You will need the paralellogram law to 
verify the additivity of the RHS. Note the polarization identity is a bit more transparent 
for real vector spaces. There we have
