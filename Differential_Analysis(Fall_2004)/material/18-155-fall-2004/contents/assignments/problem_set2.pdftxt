Problem set 2: Due September 28 

From Notes: Problems 6, 11, 12, 13, 14. 

Problem 1  Show that the smallest 

-algebra containing the sets 

for all 

is what is called above the `Borel' 

-algebra on 

Problem 2  Let 

be any measure space (so 

is a measure on the 

-algebra 

of subsets of 

Show that the set of equivalence classes of 

-integrable functions 

on  with the equivalence relation 

is a normed linear space with the usual linear structure and the norm given by 

Problem 3  Let 

be a set with a 

-algebra. Let 

be a finite measure in 

the sense that

with the series on the right always absolutely convergenct (i.e., this is part of the 

requirement on

is any such decomposition 

of 

then 

gives such a decomposition of

Hint 2. See W. Rudin, Real and complex analysis, third edition ed., McGraw-Hill, 1987. p. 117! 

Problem 4 (Hahn Decomposition) 

With assumptions as in Problem 3: 

1. 

Show that

Show that

such that 

Hint. Use the definition of

Given 

apply this result repeatedly (say with

sequence of sets

Now let

Show that 

is as required. 

Problem 5 

Now suppose that 
is a finite, positive Radon measure on a locally compact metric space 
(meaning a finite positive Borel measure outer regular on Borel sets and inner regular 

on open sets). Show that 

is inner regular on all Borel sets and hence, given 

and 

there exist sets

open such that

Hint. First take 

open, then use its inner regularity to find  with
