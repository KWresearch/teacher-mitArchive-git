Problem set 1 
Due September 23, 1PM. (Sorry about saying September 16!) Problems 1-5, 10 (I am 
dropping 11 because I will not get far enough) from the notes. Here they are, with the 
wording changed a bit. 

Problem 1 (Notes 1)  Prove that 
, defined by (1.10) is linear. 
Problem 2 (Notes 2)  Prove Lemma I.8. 

Hint(s). All functions here are supposed to be continuous, I just don't bother to keep on 
saying it. 

1.	 Recall, or check, that the local compactness of a metric space  means that for 

each point 

there is an 

such that the ball 

is 

compact for 

2.  First do the case 

so 

is a compact set in an open subset. 

to cover  with a finite 
use the local compactness of 
1.	 Given 
number of compact closed balls of radius at most 

2.	 Deduce that if 
where


is small enough then the set


is compact. 

3.	 Show that 

for 

compact, is continuous. 

4.  Given 

show that there is a continuous function 

such that 

for 

and 

for

small enough. 
3.	 Prove the general case by induction over 

satisfies the conditions for

1.	

In the general case, set 

and show that the inductive 

hypothesis applies to 

and the 

for 

let 

be the 

functions supplied by the inductive assumption and put

4.  Use the case 

construct a function 
for 
again to find 
such that 

and

and 

5.  Make sense of the functions 

and show that they satisfies the inductive assumptions. 

Problem 3 (Notes 3)  (Easy) Show that 
intersections. 

-algebras are closed under countable 

Problem 4 (Notes 4)  (Easy) Show that if 

is a complete measure and 

where 

is measurable and has measure 0 then 
Problem 5 (Notes 5)  Show that (in a locally compact metric space) compact subsets are 
measurable for any Borel measure. (This just means that compact sets are Borel sets if 
you follow through the tortuous terminology.) 

Problem 6 (Notes 10)  For the space 
guess a description of its dual in terms of sequences. 

, describe 

and
