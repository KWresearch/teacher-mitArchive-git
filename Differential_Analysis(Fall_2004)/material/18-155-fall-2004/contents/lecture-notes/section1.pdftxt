1.  Continuous  functions 

A  the  beginning  I  want  to  remind  you  of  things  I  think  you  already 
know  and  then  go  on  to  show  the  direction  the  course  will  be  taking. 
Let me  ﬁrst  try  to  set  the  context. 
One  basic  notion  I  assume  you  are  reasonably  familiar  with  is  that 
of  a  metric  space  ([5]  p.9).  This  consists  of  a  set,  X,  and  a  distance 
function 

(1.1)	

d : X × X  = X 2  −∀ [0, ⊂ ) , 
satisfying  the  following  three  axioms: 
i)  d(x, y ) = 0 ≤ x = y ,  (and  d(x, y ) → 0) 
ii)  d(x, y ) = d(y , x)  �  x, y ≥ X 
iii)  d(x, y ) ⊃ d(x, z ) + d(z , y )  �  x, y , z ≥ X. 
The  basic  theory  of  metric  spaces  deals  with  properties  of  subsets 
(open,  closed,  compact,  connected),  sequences  (convergent,  Cauchy) 
and  maps  (continuous)  and  the  relationship  between  these  notions. 
Let me  just  remind  you  of  one  such  result. 

Proposition  1.1.  A  map  f  :  X  ∀  Y  between  metric  spaces  is  con­
tinuous  if  and  only  if  one  of  the  three  fol lowing  equivalent  conditions 
holds 
(1)  f −1 (O) ∃ X  is  open  �  O ∃ Y  open. 
(2)  f −1 (C ) ∃ X  is  closed  �  C  ∃ Y  closed. 
(3)  limn�∗ f (xn ) = f (x)  in  Y  if  xn  ∀ x  in  X . 
The  basic  example  of  a  metric  space  is  Euclidean  space.  Real  n-
dimensional  Euclidean  space,  Rn ,  is  the  set  of  ordered  n-tuples  of  real 
numbers 

x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ≥ Rn  ,  xj  ≥ R ,  j  = 1, . . . , n . 
It  is  also  the  basic  example  of  a  vector  (or  linear)  space  with  the  oper­
ations 

x + y = (x1  + y1 , x2  + y2 , . . . , xn  + yn ) 
cx = (cx1 , . . . , cxn ) . 
The metric  is  usually  taken  to  be  given  by  the  Euclidean  metric 
n 
 
| x| = (x1  + · · · + xn )1/2  = ( 
xj )1/2  ,

in  the  sense  that 

d(x, y ) =  | x − y |  .

Let  us  abstract  this  immediately  to  the  notion  of  a  normed  vector 
space, or normed space.  This is a vector space V  (over R or C) equipped 
with  a  norm,  which  is  to  say  a  function 

satisfying 

(1.2) 

⇒ ⇒ : V  −∀ [0, ⊂) 

i)  ⇒v⇒ = 0 ∞⇔ v = 0, 
ii)  ⇒cv⇒ =  |c| ⇒v⇒ � c ≥ K, 
iii)  ⇒v + w⇒ ⊃ ⇒v⇒ + ⇒w⇒. 

This  means  that  (V , d),  d(v , w) = ⇒v − w⇒ is  a  vector  space;  I  am  also 
using  K  to  denote  either  R  or  C  as  is  appropriate. 
The  case of a ﬁnite dimensional  normed  space  is not very  interesting 
because,  apart  from  the  dimension,  they  are  all  “the  same”.  We  shall 
say  (in  general)  that  two  norms  ⇒ • ⇒1  and  ⇒ • ⇒2  on  V  are  equivalent 
of  there  exists  C  > 0  such  that 
1 
⇒v⇒1  ⊃ ⇒v⇒2  ⊃ C ⇒v⇒1  � v  ≥ V  . 
C 
Proposition  1.2.  Any  two norms on  a ﬁnite  dimensional vector  space 
are  equivalent. 

So,  we  are  mainly  interested  in  the  inﬁnite  dimensional  case.  I  will 
start  the  course,  in  a  slightly  unorthodox manner,  by  concentrating  on 
one  such  normed  space  (really  one  class).  Let  X  be  a  metric  space. 
The  case  of  a  continuous  function,  f  : X  ∀ R  (or  C)  is  a  special  case 
of  Proposition  1.1  above.  We  then  deﬁne 

C (X ) = {f  : X  ∀ R,  f  bounded  and  continuous} . 

In  fact  the  same  notation  is  generally  used  for  the  space  of complex-
valued  functions.  If  we  want  to  distinguish  between  these  two  possi­
bilities  we  can  use  the  more  pedantic  notation  C (X ; R)  and  C (X ; C). 
Now,  the  ‘obvious’ norm on  this  linear  space  is  the  supremum  (or  ‘uni­
form’)  norm 

⇒f ⇒∗  =  sup |f (x)| . 
x→X 
Here  X  is  an  arbitrary  metric  space.  For  the  moment  X  is  sup­
posed  to  be  a  “physical”  space,  something  like  Rn .  Corresponding  to 
the  ﬁnite-dimensionality  of  Rn  we  often  assume  (or  demand)  that  X 
is  local ly  compact.  This  just  means  that  every  point  has  a  compact 
neighborhood,  i.e.,  is  in  the  interior  of  a  compact  set.  Whether  locally

compact  or  not  we  can  consider 
 


(1.3)  C0 (X ) =  f  ≥ C (X );  � � > 0  � K  
 X s.t. sup |f (x)| ⊃ �
x /→K 
Here  the  notation K  
 X  means  ‘K  is  a  compact  subset  of X ’. 
If  V  is  a  normed  linear  space  we  are  particularly  interested  in  the 
continuous  linear  functionals  on  V .  Here  ‘functional’  just means  func­
tion  but  V  is  allowed  to  be  ‘large’  (not  like  Rn )  so  ‘functional’  is  used 
for  historical  reasons.

Proposition  1.3.  The  fol lowing  are  equivalent  conditions  on  a  linear 
functional  u : V  −∀ R  on  a  normed  space  V . 
(1)  u  is  continuous. 
(2)  u  is  continuous  at  0. 
(3)  {u(f ) ≥ R ;  f  ≥ V  ,  ⇒f ⇒ ⊃ 1} is  bounded. 
(4)  � C  s.t.  |u(f )| ⊃ C ⇒f ⇒ � f  ≥ V . 

Proof.  (1)  =⇔  (2)  by  deﬁnition.  Then  (2)  implies  that  u−1 (−1, 1)  is 
a  neighborhood  of  0  ≥  V ,  so  for  some  �  >  0,  u({f  ≥ V ; ⇒f ⇒ < �})  ∃ 
(−1, 1).  By  linearity  of  u,  u({f  ≥ V ; ⇒f ⇒ < 1}) ∃ (− 1 
� ,  � )  is  bounded, 
1
so  (2) =⇔ (3).  Then  (3)  implies  that 

|u(f )| ⊃ C  � f  ≥ V , ⇒f ⇒ ⊃ 1 

for  some  C .  Again  using  linearity  of  u,  if  f  ⇐= 0, 
 
 
f 
�
�
|u(f )| ⊃ ⇒f ⇒u 
⇒f ⇒ 
giving  (4).  Finally,  assuming  (4), 

⊃ C ⇒f ⇒ , 

|u(f ) − u(g )| = |u(f − g )| ⊃ C ⇒f − g⇒ 

shows  that  u  is  continuous  at  any  point  g ≥ V . 

� 

In  view  of  this  identiﬁcation,  continuous  linear  functionals  are  often 
said  to  be  bounded.  One  of  the  important  ideas  that  we  shall  exploit 
later  is  that  of  ‘duality’.  In  particular  this  suggests  that  it  is  a  good 
idea  to  examine  the  totality  of  bounded  linear  functionals  on  V .  The 
dual  space  is 
V ∞  = V �  = {u  : V  −∀ K ,  linear  and  bounded} . 

This  is  also  a  normed  linear  space  where  the  linear  operations  are 

(1.4) 

(u + v )(f ) = u(f ) + v (f )
(cu)(f ) = c(u(f )) 

� f  ≥ V .

The  natural  norm  on  V ∞  is 
⇒u⇒ =  sup  |u(f )|. 
≤f ≤�1 
This  is  just  the  ‘best  constant’  in  the  boundedness  estimate, 
⇒u⇒ =  inf {C ; |u(f )| ⊃ C ⇒f ⇒ � f  ∃ V } . 
One  of  the  basic  questions  I  wish  to  pursue  in  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the 
course  is:  What is the dual of C0 (X ) for a locally compact metric space 
X ?  The  answer  is  given  by  Riesz’  representation  theorem,  in  terms  of 
(Borel) measures. 
Let  me  give  you  a  vague  picture  of  ‘regularity  of  functions’  which 
is  what  this  course  is  about,  even  though  I  have  not  introduced  most 
of  these  spaces  yet.  Smooth  functions  (and  small  spaces)  are  towards 
the  top.  Duality  ﬂips  up  and  down  and  as  we  shall  see  L2 ,  the  space 
of  Lebesgue  square-integrable  functions,  is  generally  ‘in  the  middle’. 
What  I  will  discuss  ﬁrst  is  the  right  side  of  the  diagramme,  where  we 
have  the  space  of  continuous  functions  on  Rn  which  vanish  at  inﬁnity 
and  its dual  space, Mﬁn (Rn ),  the  space  of ﬁnite Borel measures.  There 
are many other spaces  that you may encounter, here I only  include  test 
functions,  Schwartz  functions,  Sobolev  spaces  and  their  duals;  k  is  a 
general  positive  integer.

I have set the goal of understanding the dual space Mﬁn (Rn ) of C0 (X ), 
where  X  is  a  locally  compact  metric  space.  This  will  force  me  to  go 
through  the  elements  of  measure  theory  and  Lebesgue  integration.  It 
does  require  a  little  forcing! 
The  basic  case  of  interest  is  Rn .  Then  an  obvious  example  of  a  con­
tinuous  linear  functional  on  C0 (Rn )  is  given  by  Riemann  integration,

u(f ) = 

f (x) dx . 

for  instance  over  the  unit  cube  [0, 1]n : 
 
�
[0,1]n 
In  some  sense  we  must  show  that  al l  continuous  linear  functionals 
on  C0 (X )  are  given  by  integration.  However,  we  have  to  interpret 
integration somewhat widely since there are also evaluation functionals. 
If  z ≥ X  consider  the  Dirac  delta 
�z (f ) = f (z ) . 
This  is  also  called  a  point  mass  of  z .  So  we  need  a  theory  of  measure 
and  integration  wide  enough  to  include  both  of  these  cases. 
One  special  feature of C0 (X ), compared  to general normed  spaces,  is 
that  there  is  a  notion  of  positivity  for  its  elements.  Thus  f  →  0  just 
means  f (x) → 0  � x ≥ X . 

Lemma  1.4.  Each  f  ≥ C0 (X )  can  be  decomposed  uniquely  as  the  dif­
ference  of  its  positive  and  negative  parts 
(1.6) 
f  = f+  − f−  , f±  ≥ C0 (X ) , f± (x) ⊃ |f (x)|  � x ≥ X . 
Proof.  Simply  deﬁne 
 
f± (x) =  ±f (x) 
if 
±f (x) → 0 


0 
if 
±f (x) < 0 
for  the  same  sign  throughout.  Then  (1.6)  holds.  Observe  that  f+  is 
continuous  at  each  y ≥ X  since,  with  U  an  appropriate  neighborhood 
of  y ,  in  each  case 
f (y ) > 0 =⇔ f (x) > 0  for  x ≥ U  =⇔ f+  = f  in  U 

f (y ) < 0 =⇔ f (x) < 0  for  x ≥ U  =⇔ f+  = 0  in  U 

f (y ) = 0 =⇔  given  � > 0  � U  s.t.  |f (x)| < � in  U 

=⇔ |f+ (x)| < � in  U . 
Thus f−  = f − f+  ≥ C0 (X ), since both f+  and f−  vanish at inﬁnity.  � 
We  can  similarly  split  elements  of  the  dual  space  into  positive  and 
negative  parts  although  it  is  a  little  bit  more  delicate.  We  say  that 
u ≥ (C0 (X ))∞  is  positive  if 
(1.7)	
u(f ) → 0  � 0 ⊃ f  ≥ C0 (X ) . 
For  a  general  (real)  u ≥ (C0 (X ))∞  and  for  each  0 ⊃ f  ≥ C0 (X )  set 
(1.8)  u+ (f ) = sup {u(g ) ;  g ≥ C0 (X ) , 0 ⊃ g (x) ⊃ f (x)  � x ≥ X } .

This  is  certainly  ﬁnite  since  u(g )  ⊃  C ⇒g⇒∗  ⊃  C ⇒f ⇒∗ .  Moreover,  if 
0  <  c  ≥  R  then  u+(cf ) =  cu+ (f )  by  inspection.  Suppose  0  ⊃  fi  ≥ 
C0 (X )  for  i  = 1, 2.  Then  given  �  >  0  there  exist  gi  ≥  C0 (X )  with 
0 ⊃ gi (x) ⊃ fi (x)  and 

u+ (fi ) ⊃ u(gi) + � . 
It  follows  that  0 ⊃ g (x) ⊃ f1 (x) + f2 (x)  if  g = g1  + g2  so 
u+ (f1  + f2 ) → u(g ) = u(g1) + u(g2 ) → u+(f1 ) + u+ (f2 ) − 2� . 
Thus 

u+ (f1  + f2 ) → u+(f1 ) + u+(f2 ). 
Conversely,  if  0  ⊃  g (x)  ⊃  f1 (x) + f2 (x)  set  g1 (x)  =  min(g , f1)  ≥ 
C0 (X )  and  g2  =  g  − g1 .  Then  0  ⊃  gi  ⊃  fi  and  u+(f1 ) + u+ (f2 )  → 
u(g1) + u(g2 ) =  u(g ).  Taking  the  supremum  over  g ,  u+(f1  + f2 )  ⊃ 
u+(f1 ) + u+(f2 ),  so  we  ﬁnd 
u+(f1  + f2 ) = u+(f1 ) + u+(f2 ) . 
(1.9) 
Having shown this eﬀective  linearity on the positive functions we can 
obtain  a  linear  functional  by  setting 
(1.10) 
u+(f ) = u+ (f+ ) − u+(f− )  � f  ≥ C0 (X ) . 
Note  that  (1.9)  shows  that  u+ (f ) =  u+(f1 ) − u+ (f2 )  for  any  decom­
posiiton of f  = f1 − f2  with fi  ≥ C0 (X ), both positive.  [Since f1 + f−  = 
2  + f+  so  u+(f1 ) + u+(f− ) = u+(f2 ) + u+(f+ ).] Moreover, 
f
|u+(f )| ⊃ max(u+(f+ ), u(f− )) ⊃ ⇒u⇒ ⇒f ⇒∗ 
=⇔ ⇒u+⇒ ⊃ ⇒u⇒ . 

The  functional 

−  = u+  − u 
u
is  also  positive,  since  u+ (f )  →  u(f )  for  all  0  ⊃  f  ≥  C0 (x).  Thus  we 
have  proved 
Lemma  1.5.  Any  element  u ≥ (C0 (X ))∞  can  be  decomposed, 
u = u+  − u− 
into  the  diﬀerence  of  positive  elements  with 
⇒u+⇒ ,  ⇒u−⇒ ⊃ ⇒u⇒ . 
The  idea  behind  the  deﬁnition  of  u+  is  that  u  itself  is, more  or  less, 
“integration  against  a  function”  (even  though  we  do  not  know  how  to 
interpret  this  yet).  In  deﬁning  u+  from  u  we  are  eﬀectively  throwing 
away the negative part of that ‘function.’  The next step is to show that 
a  positive  functional  corresponds  to  a  ‘measure’  meaning  a  function 

8 

RICHARD B.  MELROSE 

�E (x) = 

measuring  the  size  of  sets.  To  deﬁne  this  we  really  want  to  evaluate  u 
on  the  characteristic  function  of  a  set 
 
if  x ≥ E 
1 


0 
if  x  /≥ E . 
The  problem  is  that  �E  is  not  continuous.  Instead  we  use  an  idea 
similar  to  (1.8). 
If  0 ⊃ u ≥ (C0 (X ))∞  and  U  ∃ X  is  open,  set1 
(1.11)  µ(U ) = sup {u(f ) ;  0 ⊃ f (x) ⊃ 1, f  ≥ C0 (X ) ,  supp(f ) 
 U } . 
Here the support of f , supp(f ), is the closure  of the set of points where 
f (x)  ⇐=  0.  Thus  supp(f )  is  always  closed,  in  (1.11)  we  only  admit  f  if 
its  support  is  a  compact  subset  of  U.  The  reason  for  this  is  that,  only 
then  do  we  ‘really  know’  that  f  ≥ C0 (X ). 
Suppose  we  try  to measure  general  sets  in  this  way.  We  can  do  this 
by  deﬁning 
µ � (E ) =  inf {µ(U ) ;  U  � E ,  U  open} . 
(1.12) 
Already  with  µ  it may  happen  that  µ(U ) = ⊂,  so  we  think  of 
µ �  : P (X ) ∀ [0, ⊂] 
(1.13) 
as  deﬁned  on  the  power  set  of  X  and  taking  values  in  the  extended 
positive  real  numbers. 
Deﬁnition  1.6.  A  positive extended  function,  µ� , deﬁned on  the power 
set  of  X  is  cal led  an  outer  measure  if  µ� (∈) = 0,  µ� (A)  ⊃  µ (B )

supp(f ) is covered by a ﬁnite union of the Ai s.  Applying Lemma 1.8 we
