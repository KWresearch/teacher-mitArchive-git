3.  Measureability  of  functions 
Suppose  that M is  a � -algebra  on  a  set X 4  and N  is  a � -algebra  on 
another  set Y . A map  f  : X  � Y  is  said  to be measurable  with  respect 
to  these  given  � -algebras  on X  and  Y  if 

(3.1) 

f −1 (E ) ≤ M � E  ≤ N . 

Notice  how  similar  this  is  to  one  of  the  characterizations  of  continuity 
for  maps  between  metric  spaces  in  terms  of  open  sets.  Indeed  this 
analogy  yields  a  useful  result.

Lemma  3.1.  If  G ∀ N  generates  N ,  in  the  sense  that 
 
{N ∗ ; N � G,  N ∗  a  � -algebra} 
�
∗
then  f  : X  −� Y  is  measurable  iﬀ  f −1 (A) ≤ M for  al l  A ≤ G. 
Proof.  The  main  point  to  note  here  is  that  f −1  as  a  map  on  power 
sets,  is  very  well  behaved  for  any  map.  That  is  if  f  :  X  �  Y  then 
−1  : P (Y ) � P (X )  satisﬁes:

Putting  these  things  together  one  sees  that  if  M  is  any  � -algebra  on 
X  then 

 
f� (M) =  E  ∀ Y ; f −1(E ) ≤ M 
�


is  always  a  � -algebra  on  Y . 
In  particular  if  f −1 (A) ≤ M for  all  A ≤ G ∀ N  then  f� (M)  is  a  � -
algebra containing G, hence  containing N  by  the generating condition. 
Thus  f −1 (E ) ≤ M for  all E  ≤ N  so  f  is measurable.

Proposition  3.2.  Any  continuous  map  f  :  X  �  Y  between  metric 
spaces  is  measurable  with  respect  to  the  Borel  � -algebras  on  X  and  Y . 

4Then  X,  or  if  you  want  to  be  pedantic  (X, M),  is  often  said  to  be  a  measure 
space  or  even  a measurable  space.

Proof.  The  continuity  of  f  shows  that  f −1 (E )  ∀  X  is  open  if  E  ∀  Y 
is  open.  By  deﬁnition,  the  open  sets  generate  the  Borel  � -algebra  on 
Y  so  the  preceeding  Lemma  shows  that  f  is  Borel measurable  i.e., 
f −1 (B(Y )) ∀ B(X ).

We  are  mainly  interested  in  functions  on  X.  If  M  is  a  � -algebra 
on  X  then  f  :  X  �  R  is  measurable  if  it  is  measurable  with  respect 
to  the  Borel  � -algebra  on  R  and  M  on  X.  More  generally,  for  an 
extended  function  f  : X  �  [−⊂, ⊂]  we  take  as  the  ‘Borel’  � -algebra 
in [−⊂, ⊂] the smallest � -algebra containing all open subsets of R and 
all  sets  (a, ⊂]  and  [−⊂, b);  in  fact  it  is  generated  by  the  sets  (a, ⊂]. 
(See  Problem  6.) 
Our main  task  is  to deﬁne  the  integral  of  a measurable  function:  we 
start  with  simple  functions.  Observe  that  the  characteristic  function 
of  a  set 

�E  = 

x ≤ E 
1 
�
x  /≤ E 
0 
is measurable  if  and  only  if E  ≤ M. More  generally  a  simple  function, 
 
N 
�
ai�Ei , ai  ≤ R 
i=1 
is  measurable  if  the  Ei  are  measurable.  The  presentation,  (3.5),  of  a 
simple  function  is  not  unique.  We  can make  it  so,  getting  the minimal 
presentation,  by  insisting  that  all  the  ai  are  non-zero  and 
Ei  = {x ≤ E ;  f (x) = ai} 
then  f  in  (3.5)  is measurable  iﬀ  all  the  Ei  are measurable. 
The  Lebesgue  integral  is  based  on  approximation  of  functions  by 
simple  functions,  so  it  is  important  to  show  that  this  is  possible.

Proposition  3.3.  For  any  non-negative  µ-measurable  extended  func­
tion  f  :  X  −�  [0, ⊂]  there  is  an  increasing  sequence  fn  of  simple 
measurable  functions  such  that  limn�� fn (x) =  f (x)  for  each  x  ≤  X 
and  this  limit  is  uniform  on  any  measurable  set  on  which  f  is  ﬁnite. 

Proof.  Folland  [1] page 45 has a nice proof.  For each  integer n > 0 and 
0 ⊃ k ⊃ 22n  − 1,  set 
En,k  = {x ≤ X ; 2−nk ⊃ f (x) < 2−n (k + 1)}, 
∗E = {x ≤ X ; f (x) → 2n}.

These  are measurable  sets.  On  increasing  n  by  one,  the  interval  in  the 
deﬁnition  of  En,k  is  divided  into  two.  It  follows  that  the  sequence  of 
simple  functions 

fn  =

k 
is  increasing  and  has  limit  f  and  that  this  limit  is  uniform  on  any 
measurable  set  where  f  is  ﬁnite.
