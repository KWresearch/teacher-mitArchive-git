16.  Spectral  theorem 

For a bounded operator T  on a Hilbert space we deﬁne  the spectrum 
as  the  set 
(16.1) 

spec(T ) = {z  ⊂ C; T  − z Id  is  not  invertible}. 

Proposition  16.1.  For any  bounded  linear operator  on a Hilbert  space 
spec(T ) � C  is  a  compact  subset  of  {|z | ∪ �T �}. 

Proof.  We  show  that  the  set C \ spec(T ) (generally  called  the  resolvent 
set  of  T )  is  open  and  contains  the  complement  of  a  suﬃciently  large 
ball.  This  is  based  on  the  convergence  of  the Neumann  series.  Namely 
if  T  is  bounded  and  �T � < 1  then 

(16.2) 

T j 

(Id −T )−1  = 

� 


j=0 
converges  to a bounded  operator which  is a  two-sided  inverse  of  Id −T . 
Indeed,  �T j �  ∪  �T �j  so  the  series  is  convergent  and  composing  with 
Id −T  on  either  side  gives  a  telescoping  series  reducing  to  the  identity. 
Applying  this  result,  we  ﬁrst  see  that 
(16.3) 
(T  − z ) = −z (Id −T /z ) 
is  invertible  if  |z | > �T �. Similarly,  if  (T − z0 )−1  exists  for  some  z0  ⊂ C 
then 
(16.4)  (T − z ) = (T − z0 )− (z − z0 ) = (T − z0 )−1 (Id −(z − z0 )(T − z0 )−1 ) 
exists  for  |z − z0 |�(T  − z0 )−1� < 1. 
� 
In  general  it  is  rather  diﬃcult  to  precisely  locate  spec(T ). 
However  for  a bounded  self-adjoint  operator  it  is  easier.  One  sign  of 
this  is  the  the  norm  of  the  operator has  an  alternative,  simple,  charac­
terization.  Namely 
if A�  = A  then  sup  ∞A�, �⇒| = �A�. 
(16.5) 
∗�∗=1 
If a is this supermum, then clearly a ∪ �A�. To see the converse, choose 
any  �,  �  ⊂ H  with  norm  1  and  then  replace  �  by  ei� �  with  �  chosen 
so  that  ∞A�, � ⇒  is  real.  Then  use  the  polarization  identity  to  write 

(16.6)  4∞A�, � ⇒ = ∞A(� + � ), (� + � )⇒ − ∞A(� − � ), (� − � )⇒ 
+ i∞A(� + i� ), (� + i� )⇒ − i∞A(� − i� ), (� − i� )⇒. 
Now,  by  the  assumed  reality  we  may  drop  the  last  two  terms  and  see 
that 
(16.7)  4|∞A�, � ⇒| ∪ a(�� + ��2 + �� − �� ) = 2a(��� + ���2 ) = 4a.

Thus  indeed  �A� = sup∗�∗=∗�∗=1  |∞A�, � ⇒| = a. 
We  can  always  subtract  a  real  constant  from  A  so  that  A ∞  =  A − t 
satisﬁes 
(16.8) 

−  inf  ∞A∞�, �⇒ =  sup  ∞A∞�, �⇒ = �A∞ �. 
∗�∗=1 
∗�∗=1 
Then,  it  follows  that A∞ ± �A∞�  is  not  invertible.  Indeed,  there  exists  a 
sequence  �n ,  with  ��n� = 1  such  that  ∞(A∞  − �A∞�)�n , �n ⇒ � 0.  Thus 
(16.9) 
�(A∞−�A∞�)�n� = −2∞A∞�n , �n⇒+�A∞�n� +�A∞�2  ∪ −2∞A∞�n , �n⇒+2�A∞�2  � 0.

This  shows  that A∞ − �A∞ � cannot be  invertible  and the  same argument 
works  for A∞  + �A∞�.  For  the  original  operator A  if  we  set 
m =  inf  ∞A�, �⇒ M  =  sup  ∞A�, �⇒ 
(16.10) 
∗�∗=1 
∗�∗=1 
then we  conclude  that  neither A − m Id  nor A − M Id  is  invertible  and 
�A� = max(−m, M ). 

Proposition  16.2.  If  A  is  a  bounded  self-adjoint  operator  then,  with 
m  and M  deﬁned  by  (16.10), 
{m} � {M } � spec(A) � [m, M ]. 
(16.11) 

Proof.  We  have  already  shown  the  ﬁrst  part,  that  m  and  M  are  in 
the  spectrum  so  it  remains  to  show  that  A −  z  is  invertible  for  all 
z  ⊂ C \ [m, M ]. 
Using  the  self-adjointness 
Im∞(A − z )�, �⇒ = − Im z���2 . 
(16.12) 
This  implies  that  A − z  is  invertible  if  z  ⊂  C \ R.  First  it  shows  that 
(A − z )� = 0 implies � = 0, so A − z  is  injective.  Secondly,  the  range  is 
closed.  Indeed,  if  (A − z )�n  � �  then  applying  (16.12)  directly  shows 
that  ��n�  is  bounded  and  so  can  be  replaced  by  a  weakly  convergent 
subsequence.  Applying  (16.12)  again  to  �n  − �m  shows  that  the  se­
quence  is actually Cauchy,  hence  convergens  to �  so  (A − z )� = �  is  in 
the  range.  Finally,  the orthocomplement  to  this  range  is  the null  space 
of A� − ¯z , which  is  also  trivial,  so A − z  is  an  isomorphism  and  (16.12) 
also  shows  that  the  inverse  is  bounded,  in  fact

. 
| Im z | 
When  z  ⊂ R we  can  replace A by A∞  satisfying  (16.8).  Then we have 
to  show  that A∞ − z  is  inverible  for  |z | > �A�,  but  that  is  shown  in  the 
� 
proof  of  Proposition  16.1.

The  basic  estimate  leading  to  the  spectral  theorem  is: 

Proposition  16.3.  If  A  is  a  bounded  self-adjoint  operator  and  p  is  a 
real  polynomial  in  one  variable,

satisﬁes


�p(A)� ∪  sup  |p(t)|. 
t�[m,M ] 

Proof.  Clearly, p(A) is a bounded self-adjoint operator.  If s  /⊂ p([m, M ]) 
then  p(A) − s  is  invertible.  Indeed,  the  roots  of  p(t) − s  must  cannot 
lie  in  [m.M ],  since  otherwise  s ⊂ p([m, M ]).  Thus,  factorizing  p(s) − t 
we  have 
(16.16) 

p(t) − s = cN 

exists


since  p(A) = 

(t − ti (s)), ti (s)  /⊂ [m, M ]

(A − ti (s))  and  each  of  the  factors  is  invertible. 
N  �

Thus  spec(p(A))  �  p([m, M ]),  which  is  an  interval  (or  a  point),  and 
from Proposition  16.3 we  conclude  that  �p(A)� ∪ sup p([m, M ])  which 
� 
is  (16.15). 

=≤ (p(A) − s)−1 

Now,  reinterpreting  (16.15)  we  have  a  linear map 
(16.17) 
P (R) � p  ∈−� p(A) ⊂ B(H ) 
from  the  real  polynomials  to  the  bounded  self-adjoint  operators  which 
is  continuous  with  respect  to  the  supremum  norm  on  [m, M ].  Since 
polynomials  are  dense  in  continuous  functions  on  ﬁnite  intervals,  we 
see  that  (16.17)  extends  by  continuity  to  a  linear map 
(16.18) 

C ([m, M ]) � f  ∈−� f (A) ⊂ B(H ),  �f (A)� ∪ �f �[m,M ] ,  f g (A) = f (A)g (A)

where  the multiplicativity  follows  by  continuity  together  with  the  fact 
that  it  is  true  for  polynomials. 
Now, consider any two elements �, � ⊂ H. Evaluating f (A) on � and 
pairing  with  �  gives  a  linear map 
(16.19) 
C ([m, M ]) � f  ∈−� ∞f (A)�, � ⇒ ⊂ C. 
This is a linear functional on C ([m, M ]) to which we can apply the Riesz 
representatin  theorem  and  conclude  that  it  is  deﬁned  by  integration

against  a  unique  Radon measure  µ�,�  : 
�
[m,M ] 
The  total  mass  |µ�,� |  of  this  measure  is  the  norm  of  the  functional. 
Since  it  is  a Borel measure,  we  can  take  the  integral  on −→, b]  for  any 
b  ⊂  R  ad,  with  the  uniqueness,  this  shows  that  we  have  a  continuous 
sesquilinear  map 
(16.21) 
Pb (�, � ) : H ×H  � (�, � )  ∈−� 

�
[m,b] 
From  the  Hilbert  space  Riesz  representation  theorem  it  follows  that 
this  sesquilinear  form  deﬁnes,  and  is  determined  by,  a  bounded  linear 
operator 
Pb (�, � ) = ∞Pb�, � ⇒,  �Pb� ∪ �A�. 
(16.22) 
In  fact,  from  the  functional  calculus  (the  multiplicativity  in  (16.18)) 
we  see  that 
P �  = Pb ,  P 2  = Pb ,  �Pb� ∪ 1,
(16.23)

so  Pb  is  a  pro jection. 
Thus  the  spectral  theorem  gives  us  an  increasing  (with  b)  family  of 
commuting  self-adjoint  pro jections  such  that  µ�,� ((−→, b]) = ∞Pb�, � ⇒ 
determines  the  Radon  measure  for  which  (16.20)  holds.  One  can  go 
further  and  think  of  Pb  itself  as  determining  a measure 
(16.24)	
µ((−→, b]) = Pb 
which  takes  values  in  the  pro jections  on H  and  which  allows  the  func­
tions  of A  to  be  written  as  integrals  in  the  form 
�
[m,M ] 
of  which  (16.20)  becomes  the  ‘weak  form’.  To  do  so  one  needs  to 
develop  the  theory  of  such  measures  and  the  corresponding  integrals. 
This  is  not  so  hard  but  I  shall  not  do  it.
