5.  Hilbert  space 

We have shown that Lp (X, µ) is a Banach space – a complete normed 
space.  I  shall  next  discuss  the  class  of Hilbert  spaces,  a  special  class  of 
Banach  spaces,  of  which  L2 (X, µ)  is  a  standard  example,  in  which  the 
norm  arises  from  an  inner  product,  just  as  it  does  in  Euclidean  space. 
An  inner  product  on  a  vector  space  V  over  C  (one  can  do  the  real 
case  too,  not much  changes)  is  a  sesquilinear  form 
V  × V  � C 
written (u, v ), if u, v ⊂ V .  The  ‘sesqui-’ part  is just  linearity  in the ﬁrst 
variable 
(5.1) 
(a1u1  + a2u2  ,  v ) = a1 (u1 , v ) + a2 (u2 , v ), 
anti-linearly  in  the  second 
(5.2) 
(u, a1v1  + a2v2 ) = a1 (u, v1) + a2 (u, v2 ) 
and  the  conjugacy  condition 

(u, v ) = (v , u) . 
(5.3) 
Notice that (5.2)  follows  from (5.1) and (5.3).  If we assume  in addition 
the  positivity  condition8 
(5.4) 
(u, u) → 0 ,  (u, u) = 0 ≤ u = 0 , 
then 
⇒u⇒ = (u, u)1/2 
(5.5) 
is  a  norm  on  V ,  as  we  shall  see. 
Suppose  that u, v ⊂ V  have  ⇒u⇒ = ⇒v⇒ = 1.  Then  (u, v ) = ei�  |(u, v )| 
for some � ⊂ R.  By choice of � , e−i� (u, v ) =  |(u, v )| is real, so expanding 
out  using  linearity  for  s ⊂ R, 

0 ∀ (e −i� u − sv ,  e  u − sv )

−i� 
2 
(u, v ) + s  ⇒v⇒ 2  = 1 − 2s|(u, v )| + s . 
= ⇒u⇒ 2  − 2s Re  e 
2
The  minimum  of  this  occurs  when  s  =  |(u, v )|  and  this  is  negative 
unless  |(u, v )| ∀ 1.  Using  linearity,  and  checking  the  trivial  cases  u  = 
or  v = 0  shows  that 
(5.6) 
|(u, v )| ∀ ⇒u⇒ ⇒v⇒,  � u, v ⊂ V  . 
This  is  called  Schwarz’9  inequality. 

8Notice  that  (u, u)  is  real  by  (5.3).

9No  ‘t’  in  this  Schwarz.

Using  Schwarz’  inequality 
⇒u + v⇒ 2  = ⇒u⇒  + (u, v ) + (v , u) + ⇒v⇒ 2

∀ (⇒u⇒ + ⇒v⇒)2 
=≤ ⇒u + v⇒ ∀ ⇒u⇒ + ⇒v⇒ � u, v ⊂ V 
which  is  the  triangle  inequality. 

Deﬁnition  5.1.  A  Hilbert  space  is  a  vector  space  V  with  an  inner 
product  satisfying  (5.1)  - (5.4)  which  is  complete  as  a  normed  space 
(i.e.,  is  a  Banach  space). 

Thus  we  have  already  shown  L2 (X, µ)  to  be  a Hilbert  space  for  any 
positive  measure  µ.  The  inner  product  is

since  then  (5.3)  gives  ⇒f ⇒2 . 
Another  important  identity  valid  in  any  inner  product  spaces  is  the 
parallelogram  law: 
⇒u + v⇒ 2  + ⇒u − v⇒ 2  = 2⇒u⇒ 2  + 2⇒v⇒  . 
(5.8)

This can be used to prove the basic ‘existence theorem’ in Hilbert space 
theory. 

Lemma  5.2.  Let C  � H ,  in a Hilbert  space, be closed and convex (i.e., 
su + (1 − s)v  ⊂  C  if  u, v  ⊂  C  and  0  <  s  <  1).  Then  C  contains  a 
unique  element  of  smal lest  norm. 

Proof.  We  can  certainly  choose  a  sequence  un  ⊂ C  such  that 
⇒un⇒ � � =  inf {⇒v⇒ ;  v ⊂ C } . 
By  the  parallelogram  law, 
⇒un  − um⇒ 2  = 2⇒un⇒ 2  + 2⇒um⇒	2  − ⇒un  + um⇒ 
2 
∀ 2(⇒un⇒ 2  + ⇒um⇒ 
2 ) − 4� 2
where we use the  fact that (un + um)/2 ⊂ C  so must have norm at least 
� .  Thus  {un} is  a  Cauchy  sequence,  hence  convergent  by  the  assumed 
completeness  of  H .  Thus  lim un  =  u  ⊂ C  (since  it  is  assumed  closed) 
and  by  the  triangle  inequality 
|⇒un⇒ − ⇒u⇒| ∀ ⇒un  − u⇒ � 0 
So  ⇒u⇒ = � .  Uniqueness  of  u  follows  again  from  the  parallelogram  law 
which  shows  that  if  ⇒u�⇒ = �  then 
⇒u − u �⇒ ∀ 2� 2  − 4⇒(u + u )/2⇒ 2  ∀ 0 .

The  fundamental  fact  about  a  Hilbert  space  is  that  each  element 
v ⊂ H  deﬁnes  a  continuous  linear  functional  by 
H  � u  ∈−� (u, v ) ⊂ C 
and conversely  every  continuous  linear  functional  arises  this way.  This 
is  also  called  the  Riesz  representation  theorem. 

Proposition  5.3.  If  L  : H  �  C  is  a  continuous  linear  functional  on 
a  Hilbert  space  then  this  is  a  unique  element  v  ⊂ H  such  that 
(5.9) 
Lu = (u, v )  �  u ⊂ H , 

Proof.  Consider  the  linear  space 
M  = {u ⊂ H ;  Lu = 0} 
the  null  space  of  L,  a  continuous  linear  functional  on  H .  By  the  as­
sumed continuity, M  is closed.  We can suppose that L is not  identically 
zero  (since  then  v = 0  in  (5.9)).  Thus  there  exists  w  /⊂ M .  Consider 
w + M  = {v ⊂ H ;  v = w + u ,  u ⊂ M }  . 
This  is  a  closed  convex  subset  of  H .  Applying  Lemma  5.2  it  has  a 
unique  smallest  element,  v  ⊂  w + M .  Since  v  minimizes  the  norm  on 
w + M , 

⇒v + su⇒ 2  = ⇒v⇒  + 2 Re(su, v ) + ⇒s⇒ 2 ⇒u⇒

is  stationary  at  s  =  0.  Thus  Re(u, v ) = 0  �  u  ⊂  M ,  and  the  same 
argument  with  s  replaced  by  is  shows  that  (v , u) = 0  �  u ⊂ M . 
Now  v  ⊂  w + M ,  so  Lv  =  Lw  ≥=  0.  Consider  the  element  w �  = 
w/Lw ⊂ H .  Since  Lw �  = 1,  for  any  u ⊂ H 
L(u − (Lu)w �) = Lu − Lu = 0 . 
It  follows  that  u − (Lu)w �  ⊂ M  so  if  w ��  = w �/⇒w ⇒
� 2
� 
(w , w �)

(u, w ��) = ((Lu)w , w  ) = Lu 
��
⇒w �⇒2 
The  uniqueness  of  v  follows  from  the  positivity  of  the  norm.

Corollary  5.4.  For  any  positive  measure  µ,  any  continuous  linear 
functional 

is  of  the  form 

L  : L2 (X, µ) � C 

Lf  =

Notice the apparent power of ‘abstract reasoning’ here!  Although we 
seem  to  have  constructed  g  out  of  nowhere,  its  existence  follows  from 
the  completeness  of  L2 (X, µ),  but  it  is  very  convenient  to  express  the 
argument  abstractly  for  a  general  Hilbert  space.
