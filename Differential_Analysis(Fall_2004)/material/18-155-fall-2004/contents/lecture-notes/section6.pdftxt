6.  Test  functions 

So  far  we  have  largely  been  dealing  with  integration.  One  thing  we 
have  seen  is  that, by considering dual  spaces, we can  think of functions 
as  functionals.  Let me  brieﬂy  review  this  idea. 
Consider  the  unit  ball  in  Rn ,

n

B  = {x ≤ Rn  ;  |x| ∼ 1}  . 
I take the closed  unit ball because I want to deal with a compact metric 
space.  We  have  dealt  with  several  Banach  spaces  of  functions  on  Bn , 
for  example 

 
C (Bn ) =  u : Bn  ∩ C ;  u  continuous 
�
�
 
 
�
�
�
2
L2 (Bn ) =  u : Bn  ∩ C; Borel measurable  with 
|u| dx < ⊂ 
Here,  as  always  below,  dx is Lebesgue measure  and  functions  are  iden­
tiﬁed  if  they  are  equal  almost  everywhere. 
Since  Bn  is  compact  we  have  a  natural  inclusion 
C (Bn )  δ∩ L2 (Bn ) .

(6.1) 
This  is  also  a  topological  inclusion,  i.e.,  is  a bounded  linear map,  since

(6.2) 
�u�L2  ∼ C �u||� 
where  C 2  is  the  volume  of  the  unit  ball. 
In  general  if  we  have  such  a  set  up  then 

 
. 

 

Lemma  6.1.  If  V  δ∩ U  is  a  subspace  with  a  stronger  norm, 
���U  ∼ C ���V  �  � ≤ V 
then  restriction  gives  a  continuous  linear  map 
L = L|V  ≤ V ≤ ,  � ˜
U ≤  ∩ V ≤ ,  U ≤  � L ∈−∩  ˜
(6.3) 
L�V �  ∼ C �L�U �  . 
If  V  is  dense  in  U  then  the  map  (6.3)  is  injective. 

 

Proof.  By  deﬁnition  of  the  dual  norm

∼ sup 
 L(v )
�
�

�
∼ sup {|L(u)|  ; �u�U  ∼ C ,  u ≤ U } 
= C �L�U �  . 
If  V  ⊃  U  is  dense  then  the  vanishing  of  L  :  U  ∩  C  on  V  implies  its 
vanishing  on  U .

Going back to the particular case (6.1) we do indeed get a continuous 
map  between  the  dual  spaces 
L2 (Bn ) ∃= (L2 (Bn ))≤  ∩ (C (Bn ))≤  = M (Bn ) . 
Here  we  use  the  Riesz  representation  theorem  and  duality  for  Hilbert 
spaces.  The map  use  here  is  supposed  to  be  linear  not  antilinear,  i.e., 
 
�
So the idea is to make the space of ‘test functions’ as small as reasonably 
possible,  while  still  retaining  density  in  reasonable  spaces. 
Recall  that a  function u : Rn  ∩ C  is  diﬀerentiable  at x ≤ Rn  if  there 
exists  a ≤ Cn  such  that 
|u(x) − u(x) − a · (x − x)| = o(|x − x|) .

s.t. 

|x − x| < � ≥ |u(x) − u(x) − a(x − x)| < ϕ |x − x| . 
The  coeﬃcients  of  a  = (a1 , . . . , an)  are  the  partial  derivations  of  u  at

Proof.  That � �C 1  is a norm follows from the properties of � �� .  Namely 
�u�C 1  = 0  certainly  implies  u = 0,  �au�C 1  =  |a| �u�C 1  and  the  triangle 
inequality  follows  from  the  same  inequality  for  � �� . 
Similarly,  the  main  part  of  the  completeness  of  C
0 (Rn)  follows  from 
1
If  {un}  is  a  Cauchy  sequence  in  C

then  un  and  the  �un 
are  Cauchy  in  C

limits  of  these  sequences,

However  we  do  have  to  check  that  v  is  continuously  diﬀerentiable  and 
that  � v  = vj .
�xj 
One  way  to  do  this  is  to  use  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus 
in  each  variable.  Thus

�xj

As n ∩ ⊂ all  terms  converge  and  so,  by  the  continuity  of  the  integral,

This  shows  that  the  limit  in  (6.6)  exists,  so  vi (x)  is  the  partial  deriva­
tion  of  u  with  respect  to  xi .  It  remains  only  to  show  that  u  is  indeed 
diﬀerentiable  at  each  point  and  I  leave  this  to  you  in  Problem  17.

So,  almost  by  deﬁnition,  we  have  an  example  of  Lemma  6.1,

It  is  in  fact dense  but  I will  not bother  showing  this  (yet).  So we know 
that

and  we  expect  it  to  be  injective.  Thus  there  are  more  functionals  on

0 (Rn )  including  things  that  are  ‘more  singular  than measures’.

to  get  larger  and  larger  as  k  increases. 
As  well  as  looking  at  functions  getting  smoother  and  smoother,  we 
need  to  think  about  ‘inﬁnity’,  since  Rn  is  not  compact.  Observe  that 
an  element  g  ≤ L1 (Rn )  (with  respect  to  Lebesgue  measure  by  default) 
deﬁnes a functional on C0
0 (Rn ) — and hence al l  the C0 (Rn )s.  However a 
k
function  such  as  the  constant  function  1  is  not  integrable  on Rn . Since 
we  certainly  want  to  talk  about  this,  and  polynomials,  we  consider  a 
second  condition  of  smal lness  at  inﬁnity.  Let  us  set 
∞x⇒ = (1 + |x|2 )1/2

It  is  not  immediately  apparent  that  this  space  is  non-empty  (well  0 
is  in  there  but...);  that

exp(− |x| ) ≤ S (Rn ) 

is  Problem  19.  There  are  lots  of  other  functions  in  there  as  we  shall 
see. 
Schwartz’  idea  is  that  the  dual  of  S (Rn )  should  contain  all  the  ‘in­
teresting’  ob jects,  at  least  those  of  ‘polynomial  growth’.  The  problem 
is  that we  do not  have  a  good norm  on S (Rn ). Rather we  have  a  lot  of 
them.  Observe  that 
−l�  k �
∞x⇒ −lC0 (Rn ) ⊃ ∞x⇒ C0  (Rn )  if  l → l ≤  and  k → k ≤  .

Since  these  spaces  are  getting  smaller,  we  have  a  countably  inﬁnite 
number  of  norms.  For  this  reason  S (Rn )  is  called  a  countably  normed 
space. 

S (Rn ) =

(6.12)

then  d  is  a  distance  function  in  S (Rn )  with  respect  to  which  it  is  a 
complete  metric  space.

Proof.  The  series  in  (6.12)  certainly  converges,  since 
�u − v�(k) 
1 + �u − v�(k) 
The  ﬁrst  two  conditions  on  a metric  are  clear, 
d(u, v ) = 0 ≥ �u − v�C0  = 0 ≥ u = v , 
and  symmetry  is  immediate.  The  triangle  inequality  is  perhaps  more 
mysterious! 
Certainly  it  is  enough  to  show  that 
�u − v� 
1 + �u − v� 

d˜(u, v ) =

LECTURE  NOTES  FOR  18.155,  FALL  2004

is  a metric  on  any  normed  space,  since  then  we may  sum  over  k .  Thus 
we  consider 

�u − v�
1 + �u − v� 

+ 

�v − w� 
1 + �v − w� 
�u − v�(1 + �v − w�) + �v − w�(1 + �u − v�) 
. 
(1 + �u − v�)(1 + �v − w�) 

= 

Comparing  this  to  d˜(v , w) we  must  show  that 

(1 + �u − v�)(1 + �v − w�)�u − w� 
∼ (�u − v�(1 + �v − w�) + �v − w�(1 + �u − v�))(1 + �u − w�). 

Starting  from  the  LHS  and  using  the  triangle  inequality, 

LHS  ∼ �u − w� + (�u − v� + �v − w� + �u − v��v − w�)�u − w�

∼ (�u − v� + �v − w� + �u − v��v − w�)(1 + �u − w�)

∼ RHS.


Thus,  d  is  a metric. 
Suppose  un  is  a  Cauchy  sequence.  Thus,  d(un , um) ∩  0  as  n, m ∩ 
⊂.  In  particular,  given 

ϕ > 0  �  N  s.t.  n, m > N  implies 
d(un , um ) < ϕ2−k  �  n, m > N . 

The  terms  in  (6.12)  are  all  positive,  so  this  implies 

�un  − um �(k) 
1 + �un  − um�(k) 

< ϕ  �  n, m > N . 

If  ϕ < 1/2  this  in  turn  implies  that 

�un  − um�(k)  < 2ϕ, 

so  the  sequence  is  Cauchy  in  ∞x⇒−k C0 
k (Rn )  for  each  k .  From  the  com­
pleteness  of  these  spaces  it  follows  that  un  ∩  u  in  ∞x⇒−k C0 
k (Rn )j  for 
each  k .  Given  ϕ  >  0  choose  k  so  large  that  2−k  <  ϕ/2.  Then  �  N  s.t.

This  un  ∩ u  in  S (Rn ).	
As  well  as  the  Schwartz  space,  S (Rn ),  of  functions  of  rapid  decrease 
with all derivatives, there is a smaller ‘standard’ space of test functions, 
namely 
C� (Rn ) = {u ≤ S (Rn ); supp(u) 
 Rn} ,
(6.14) 
c 
the  space  of  smooth  functions  of  compact  support.  Again,  it  is  not 
quite  obvious  that  this  has  any  non-trivial  elements,  but  it  does  as 
we  shall  see.  If  we  ﬁx  a  compact  subset  of  Rn  and  look  at  functions 
with  support  in  that  set,  for  instance  the  closed  ball  of  radius  R  >  0, 
then we get a closed subspace of S (Rn ), hence a complete metric space. 
One  ‘problem’ with  C� (Rn)  is  that  it does  not  have  a  complete metric 
c 
topology  which  restricts  to  this  topology  on  the  subsets.  Rather  we 
must  use  an  inductive  limit  procedure  to  get  a  decent  topology. 
Just  to  show  that  this  is  not  really  hard,  I  will  discuss  it  brieﬂy 
here,  but  it  is  not  used  in  the  sequel.  In  particular  I  will  not  do  this 
in  the  lectures  themselves.  By  deﬁnition  our  space  C � (Rn )  (denoted 
c 
traditionally  as D(Rn ))  is  a  countable  union  of  subspaces

simply because  the  same  is  true  for the open  sets  in  C� (B (n))  for each

is:- what  does  it  mean  for  a  linear  functional  u  :  C � (Rn ) −∩ C  to  be 
c 
continuous?  This just means that u−1 (O) is open for each open set in C. 
Directly from the deﬁnition this in turn means that u−1 (O) � C˙�(B (n))

should be open  in  C˙� (B (n))  for each n. This  however  just means  that, 
restricted  to  each  of  these  subspaces  u  is  continuous.  If  you  now  go 
forwards  to  Lemma  7.3  you  can  see  what  this means;  see  Problem  74. 
Of  course  there  is  a  lot more  to  be  said  about  these  spaces;  you  can 
ﬁnd  plenty  of  it  in  the  references.
