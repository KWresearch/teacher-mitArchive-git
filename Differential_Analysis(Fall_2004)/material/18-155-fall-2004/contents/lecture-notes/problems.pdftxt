17.  Problems 
Problem  1.  Prove  that  u+ ,  deﬁned  by  (1.10)  is  linear. 

Problem  2.  Prove  Lemma  1.8. 
Hint(s).  All  functions  here  are  supposed  to  be  continuous,  I  just 
don’t  bother  to  keep  on  saying  it. 
(1)  Recall,  or  check,  that  the  local  compactness  of  a  metric  space 
X  means  that  for  each  point  x ≤ X  there  is  an  ∂ > 0  such  that 
the  ball  { y ≤ X ; d(x, y ) → β}  is  compact  for  β → ∂. 
(2)  First  do  the  case  n = 1,  so K  � U  is  a  compact  set  in  an  open 
subset. 
(a)  Given  β  >  0,  use  the  local  compactness  of  X,  to  cover  K 
with  a  ﬁnite  number  of  compact  closed  balls  of  radius  at 
most  β. 
(b)  Deduce  that  if	 ∂  >  0  is  small  enough  then  the  set  { x  ≤ 
X ; d(x, K ) → ∂} ,  where 

d(x, K ) =  inf  d(x, y ), 
y≤K 

is  compact. 
(c)  Show  that  d(x, K ),  for K  compact,  is  continuous. 
(d)  Given  ∂  >  0  show  that  there  is  a  continuous  function  gξ  : 
R  −∩  [0, 1]  such  that  gξ (t)  =  1  for  t  →  ∂/2  and  gξ(t) = 0 
for  t > 3∂/4. 
(e)  Show that f  = gξ ⇒ d(· , K ) satisﬁes  the conditions  for n = 1 
if  ∂ > 0  is  small  enough. 
(3)  Prove  the  general  case  by  induction  over  n. 
(a)  In  the  general  case,  set  K ∞  =  K  ∃ U �  and  show  that  the 
1 
inductive hypothesis applies  to K ∞  and the Uj  for j  > 1; let 
∞ ,  j  = 2, . . . , n  be  the  functions  supplied  by  the  inductive 
f
j 
assumption  and  put  f ∞  = �j→2 fj 
∞ . 
(b)  Show  that K1  = K ∃ { f ∞  →  2 } 
is  a  compact  subset  of 
1
U1 .
(c)  Using  the  case	 n  =  1  construct  a  function  F  for  K1  and 
U1 . 
(d)  Use  the  case  n = 1  again  to  ﬁnd  G  such  that  G = 1  on K 
1 
G) � { f ∞  + 
and  supp(
F  >

and  show  that  they  satisﬁes  the  inductive  assumptions.

Problem  3.  Show  that  δ -algebras  are  closed  under  countable  intersec­
tions. 

Problem  4.  (Easy)  Show  that  if  µ  is  a  complete  measure  and  E  ⊃  F 
where  F  is measurable  and  has measure  0  then  µ(E ) = 0. 

Problem  5.  Show  that  compact  subsets  are  measurable  for  any  Borel 
measure.  (This  just  means  that  compact  sets  are  Borel  sets  if  you 
follow  through  the  tortuous  terminology.) 

Problem  6.  Show  that  the  smallest  δ -algebra  containing  the  sets 

(a, ⊂] ⊃ [−⊂, ⊂] 

for  all  a  ≤  R,  generates  what  is  called  above  the  ‘Borel’  δ -algebra  on 
[−⊂, ⊂]. 

Problem  7.  Write  down  a  careful  proof  of  Proposition  1.1. 

Problem  8.  Write  down  a  careful  proof  of  Proposition  1.2. 

Problem  9.  Let X  be  the metric  space 

X  = {0} ∗ {1/n; n ≤ N = {1, 2, . . .}} ⊃ R 

with  the  induced  metric  (i.e.  the  same  distance  as  on  R).  Recall  why 
X  is  compact.  Show  that  the  space  C0 (X )  and  its  dual  are  inﬁnite 
dimensional.  Try  to  describe  the  dual  space  in  terms  of  sequences;  at 
least  guess  the  answer. 

Problem  10.  For  the  space  Y  =  N  =  {1, 2, . . .}  ⊃  R,  describe  C0 (Y ) 
and  guess  a  description  of  its  dual  in  terms  of  sequences. 

Problem  11.  Let  (X, M, µ)  be  any  measure  space  (so  µ  is  a  measure 
on  the  δ -algebra M of  subsets  of X ). Show  that  the  set  of  equivalence 
classes  of  µ-integrable  functions  on  X,  with  the  equivalence  relation 
given  by  (4.8),  is  a normed  linear  space with  the  usual  linear  structure 
and  the  norm  given  by

Problem  12.  Let  (X, M) be  a  set with  a δ -algebra.  Let µ : M ∩ R be 
a  ﬁnite  measure  in  the  sense  that  µ(π) =  0  and  for  any  {Ei }↓

measures,  µ  =  µ+  − µ− .  Conclude  that  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
measure  based  on  (4.16)  is  the  same  as  that  in  Problem  12. 
(2)  Show  that  µ±  so  constructed  are  orthogonal  in  the  sense  that 
there  is  a  set  E  ≤ M such  that  µ− (E ) = 0,  µ+(X  \ E ) = 0. 
Hint.  Use  the  deﬁnition  of  |µ| to  show  that  for  any  F  ≤ M 
and  any  ∂  >  0  there  is  a  subset  F ∞  ≤ M,  F ∞  ⊃ F  such  that 
µ+ (F ∞ )  ↓  µ+ (F )  − ∂  and  µ− (F ∞ )  →  ∂.  Given  β >  0  apply 
this  result  repeatedly  (say  with  ∂  = 2−nβ )  to  ﬁnd  a  decreas­
ing  sequence  of  sets  F1  =  X,  Fn  ≤ M,  Fn+1  ⊃ Fn  such  that 
µ+ (Fn ) ↓ µ+(Fn−1 ) − 2−nβ  and  µ− (Fn ) → 2−nβ.  Conclude  that

Problem  14.  Now  suppose  that  µ  is  a  ﬁnite,  positive  Radon  measure 
on  a  locally  compact  metric  space  X  (meaning  a  ﬁnite  positive  Borel 
measure  outer  regular  on  Borel  sets  and  inner  regular  on  open  sets). 
Show  that  µ  is  inner  regular  on  all  Borel  sets  and  hence,  given  ∂  >  0 
and  E  ≤ B(X )  there  exist  sets  K  ⊃ E  ⊃ U  with  K  compact  and  U 
open  such  that  µ(K ) ↓ µ(E ) − ∂,  µ(E ) ↓ µ(U ) − ∂. 
Hint.  First  take  U  open,  then  use  its  inner  regularity  to  ﬁnd  K 
with  K ∞  �  U  and  µ(K ∞ )  ↓ µ(U ) − ∂/2.  How  big  is  µ(E \K ∞ )?  Find 
V  ⊥ K ∞\E  with  V  open  and  look  at K  = K ∞ \V .

Problem  15.  Using Problem  14  show  that  if µ  is  a ﬁnite Borel measure 
on a locally compact metric space X  then the following three conditions 
are  equivalent 
(1)  µ = µ1 − µ2  with µ1  and µ2  both positive ﬁnite Radon measures. 
(2)  |µ|  is  a  ﬁnite  positive  Radon measure. 
(3)  µ+  and  µ−  are  ﬁnite  positive  Radon measures. 

Problem  16.  Let  � � be  a norm  on  a  vector  space  V .  Show  that  �u� = 
(u, u)1/2  for  an  inner  product  satisfying  (5.1)  - (5.4)  if  and  only  if  the 
parallelogram  law  holds  for  every  pair  u, v ≤ V . 
Hint  (From Dimitri  Kountourogiannis) 
If  � · � comes  from  an  inner  product,  then  it must  satisfy  the  polari­
sation  identity: 

(x, y ) = 1/4(�x + y�2  − �x − y�2  − i�x + iy�2  − i�x − iy� ) 
2

i.e,  the  inner  product  is  recoverable  from  the  norm,  so  use  the  RHS 
(right  hand  side)  to  deﬁne  an  inner  product  on  the  vector  space.  You 
will  need  the  paralellogram  law  to  verify  the  additivity  of  the  RHS. 
Note  the  polarization  identity  is  a  bit more  transparent  for  real  vector 
spaces.  There  we  have 

(x, y ) = 1/2(�x + y�2  − �x − y� ) 
2

both  are  easy  to  prove  using  �a�2  = (a, a). 

Problem  17.  Show  (Rudin  does  it)  that  if  u  : Rn  ∩ C  has  continuous 
partial derivatives  then  it  is  diﬀerentiable  at  each  point  in  the  sense  of 
(6.5).

principles  to  do  this.  Show  that  it  is  enough  to  assume  u  ↓ 0  has 
compact support.  Then  show  it  is enough to assume  that u is a simple, 
and  integrable,  function.  Finally  look  at  the  deﬁnition  of  Lebesgue

Hint  This  is  not  so  easy!  I  would  be  happy  if  you  can  show  that 
u ≤  M (Rn ),  supp u ⊃  {0}  implies  u =  cβ .  To  see  this,  you  can  show 
that 

σ ≤ S (Rn ), σ(0) = 0 
≥  �σj  ≤ S (Rn ) , σj (x) = 0  in  |x| → ∂j  > 0(∪ 0) , 
sup |σj  − σ| ∩ 0  as  j ∩ ⊂ . 
To prove  the  general  case  you need  something  similar —  that given m, 
if  σ ≤ S (Rn )  and D�
xσ(0) = 0  for  |�| → m then  � σj  ≤ S (Rn ),  σj  = 0 
in  |x| → ∂j  , ∂j  ∪ 0  such  that  σj  ∩ σ in  the  C norm.

Problem  34.  Recall  that  a  topology  on  a  set  X  is  a  collection  F  of 
subsets  (called  the  open  sets)  with  the  properties,  π ≤ F ,  X  ≤ F  and 
F  is  closed  under  ﬁnite  intersections  and  arbitrary  unions.  Show  that 
the  following  deﬁnition  of  an  open  set  U  ⊃ S ∞ (Rn )  deﬁnes  a  topology: 
� u ≤ U  and  all  σ ≤ S (Rn )  �∂ > 0  st. 
|(u ∞  − u)(σ)| < ∂ ≥ u ∞  ≤ U .

This  is  called  the  weak  topology  (because  there  are  very  few  open 
sets).  Show  that  uj  ∩ u  weakly  in  S ∞ (Rn )  means  that  for  every  open 
set  U  � u  �N  st.  uj  ≤ U  � j  ↓ N . 
Problem  35.  Prove  (11.18)  where  u ≤ S ∞ (Rn )  and  σ, ϕ ≤ S (Rn ).

S (Rn ) � σ  ◦∩ v � σ ≤ S (Rn ) 
is  a  continuous  linear map. 
Problem  37.  Prove  the ??  to properties in Theorem 11.6 for u � v where 
u ≤ S ∞ (Rn )  and  v  ≤ S ∞ (Rn )  with  at  least  one  of  them  having  compact 
support. 
Problem  38.  Use  Theorem  11.9  to  show  that  if  P (D)  is  hypoelliptic 
then  every  parametrix  F  ≤ S (Rn )  has  sing supp(F ) = {0}. 
Problem  39.  Show  that  if  P (D)  is  an  ellipitic  diﬀerential  operator  of 
order m,  u ≤ L2 (Rn )  and  P (D)u ≤ L2 (Rn )  then  u ≤ H m (Rn ). 
Problem  40  (Taylor’s  theorem).  .  Let  u  :  Rn  −∩  R  be  a  real-valued 
function which  is  k  times  continuously  diﬀerentiable.  Prove  that  there 
is  a  polynomial  p  and  a  continuous  function  v  such  that 
|v (x)| 
u(x) = p(x) + v (x)  where  lim 
k  = 0.

Problem  41.  Let  C (Bn )  be  the  space  of  continuous  functions  on  the 
(closed)  unit  ball,  Bn  =  {x  ≤  Rn ; |x|  →  1}.  Let  C0 (Bn )  ⊃  C (Bn )  be 
the  subspace  of  functions  which  vanish  at  each  point  of  the  boundary 
and let C (Sn−1 ) be the space of continuous functions on the unit sphere. 
Show that inclusion and restriction to the boundary gives a short exact 
sequence 

C0 (Bn )  ψ∩ C (Bn ) −∩ C (Sn−1 ) 
(meaning  the  ﬁrst  map  is  injective,  the  second  is  surjective  and  the 
image  of  the  ﬁrst  is  the  null  space  of  the  second.) 
Problem  42  (Measures).  A  measure  on  the  ball  is  a  continuous  linear 
functional  µ  :  C (Bn )  −∩  R  where  continuity  is  with  respect  to  the 
supremum  norm,  i.e.  there must  be  a  constant  C  such  that 
|µ(f )| → C  sup  |f (x)| � f  ≤ C (Bn ).

Let  M (Bn )  be  the  linear  space  of  such  measures.  The  space  M (Sn−1 ) 
of  measures  on  the  sphere  is  deﬁned  similarly.  Describe  an  injective 
map

Problem  69.  [Spectral  theorem,  compact  case]  Recall  that  a  bounded 
operator  A  on  a  Hilbert  space  H  is  compact  if  A{�u�  →  1}  is  pre-
compact  (has  compact  closure).  Throughout  this  problem  A  will  be  a 
compact  operator  on  a  separable  Hilbert  space,  H. 
i)  Show  that  if  0  ∅= � ≤ C  then 
E�  = {u ≤ H ; Au = �u}. 
is  ﬁnite  dimensional. 
ii)  If A is self-adjoint show that all eigenvalues (meaning E�  ∅= {0}) 
are  real  and  that  diﬀerent  eigenspaces  are  orthogonal. 
iii)  Show  that  �A  =  sup{|≡Au, u�|2}; �u�  = 1}  is  attained.  Hint: 
Choose  a  sequence  such  that  |≡Auj , uj �|2  tends  to  the  supre­
mum,  pass  to  a weakly  convergent  sequence  as  discussed  above 
and  then  using  the  compactness  to  a  furhter  subsequence  such 
that  Auj  converges. 
iv)  If  v  is  such  a  maximum  point  and  f  ∀  v  show  that  ≡Av , f � + 
≡Af , v � = 0. 
v)  If  A  is  also  self-adjoint  and  u  is  a  maximum  point  as  in  iii) 
deduce  that  Au = �u  for  some  � ≤ R  and  that  � = ±�. 
vi)  Still assuming A to be self-adjoint, deduce  that there  is a ﬁnite-
dimensional  subspace  M  ⊃  H,  the  sum  of  eigenspaces  with 
eigenvalues  ±�,  containing  all  the maximum  points. 
vii)  Continuing  vi)  show  that  A  restricts  to  a  self-adjoint  bounded 
operator  on  the  Hilbert  space  M �  and  that  the  supremum  in 
iii)  for  this  new  operator  is  smaller. 
viii)  Deduce  that  for  any  compact  self-adjoint  operator  on  a  sep­
arable  Hilbert  space  there  is  a  complete  orthonormal  basis  of 
eigenvectors.  Hint:  Be  careful  about  the  null  space  –  it  could

and  ﬁnally  that  it  is  enough  to  check  it  for  the  characteristic  function

such  that

ii)  (Equi-smallness  at  inﬁnity)  For  each  ∂ > 0  there  exists  R such 
that

Hint:  Problem  70  shows  that  (17.26)  holds  for  each  u ≤ L2 (Rn );  check 
that (17.27) also holds for each function.  Then use a covering argument 
to  prove  that  both  these  conditions must  hold  for  a  compact  subset  of 
L2 (R)  and  hence  for  a  precompact  set.  One  method  to  prove  the  con­
verse  is  to  show  that  if  (17.26)  and  (17.27)  hold  then  B  is  bounded 
and to use this to extract a weakly convergent  sequence  from any given 
sequence  in  B . Next  show  that  (17.26)  is  equivalent  to  (17.27)  for  the 
set  F (B ),  the  image  of  B  under  the  Fourier  transform.  Show,  possi­
bly  using  Problem  71,  that  if  λR  is  cut-oﬀ  to  a  ball  of  radius  R  then 
λRG (λR ˆun )  converges  strongly  if  un  converges  weakly.  Deduce  from 
this  that  the weakly  convergent  subsequence  in  fact converges  strongly

Problem  74.  Show that the continuity of a linear functional u : C ↓ (Rn ) −∩

C with  respect  to  the  inductive  limit  topology deﬁned  in  (6.16) means

that

Problem  83.  Show  that  for  convolution  u � v  deﬁned  under  condition 
(12.51)  it  is  still  true  that 
P (D)(u � v ) = (P (D)u) � v = u � (P (D)v ).

Problem  84.  Using  Problem  80  (or  otherwise)  show  that  integration  is 
deﬁned  as  a  functional 
{u ≤ S (Rn ); (Sn−1  × {0}) ∃ WFsc (u) = ∞} −∩ C.

If  u  satisﬁes  this  condition,  show  that  � 
P (D)u =  c � 
u  where  c  is  the 
constant  term  in  P (D),  i.e.  P (D)1 = c. 
Problem  85.  Compute  WFsc (E )  where  E  = C/|x − y | is  the  standard 
fundamental  solution  for  the  Laplacian  on  R3 .  Using  Problem  83  give 
a  condition  on WFsc (f )  under  which  u = E � f  is  deﬁned  and  satisﬁes 
φu  =  f .  Show  that  under  this  condition  � 
f  is  deﬁned  using  Prob­
lem  84.  What can  you  say  about WFsc (u)? Why  is  it not  the case  that 
� 
φu = 0,  even  though  this  is  true  if  u  has  compact  support?
