Theorem  9.1.  Fourier  transform  F  :  S (Rn ) � S (Rn )  is  an  isomor­
phism  with  inverse 
⎝ 
Proof.  The  identity  (9.2)  shows  that F  is  1 − 1,  i.e.,  injective,  since we 
can  remove  α  from  ˆα.  Moreover, 

G : S (Rn ) � S (Rn ) ,  Gη (y ) = (2� )−n 

eiy ·� η (π ) dπ . 

(9.3) 

(9.4)	

Gη (y ) = (2� )−nF η (−y ) 

So  G  is  also  a  continuous  linear  map,  G  :  S (Rn )  �  S (Rn ).  Indeed 
the  argument  above  shows  that  G ≥ F  =  I d  and  the  same  argument, 
with  some  changes  of  sign,  shows  that  F · G  =  I d.  Thus  F  and  G  are 
isomorphisms.

Proposition  9.3.  Fourier  transform  extends  to  an  isomorphism 

(9.6) 

F  : L2 (Rn ) � L2 (Rn ) . 

Proof.  Setting  α = η  in  (9.5)  shows  that 

(9.7)	

�F α�L2  = (2� )n/2�α�L2  . 
In  particular  this  proves,  given  the  known  density  of S (Rn )  in L2 (Rn), 
that F  is  an  isomorphism,  with  inverse  G ,  as  in  (9.6).

Now  that we  have  considered  the Fourier  transform  of Schwartz  test

Proof.  The Hilbert  space  property  follows  essentially  directly  from  the 
deﬁnition  (9.14)  since  ⇔π ◦−mL2 (Rn )  is  a  Hilbert  space  with  the  norm 
(9.17).  Similarly the density of S  in H m (Rn ) follows, since S (Rn ) dense 
in  L2 (Rn )  (Problem  L11.P3)  implies  ⇔π ◦−mS (Rn ) =  S (Rn )  is  dense  in 
⇔π ◦−mL2 (Rn )  and  so,  since  F  is  an  isomorphism  in  S (Rn ),  S (Rn )  is 
dense  in H m (Rn). 
Finally observe that the pairing in (9.18) makes sense, since ⇔π ◦
⇔π ◦muˆ� (π ) ≤ L2 (Rn )  implies 
ˆu(π ))uˆ�(−π ) ≤ L1 (Rn ) . 
Furthermore, by the self-duality of L2 (Rn ) each continuous  linear func­
tional 

−m ˆ
u(π ), 

U  : H m (Rn ) � C ,  U (u) ∀ C �u�Hm 
can  be  written  uniquely  in  the  form 
U (u) = ((u, u ))  for  some  u �  ≤ H −m (Rn) .

u(x)u � (x) dx . 

Notice  that  if  u, u�  ≤ S (Rn )  then

Rn 
This  is  always  how  we  “pair”  functions  —  it  is  the  natural  pairing  on 
L2 (Rn ).  Thus  in (9.18) what we have  shown  is that this pairing on test 
function 
⎝ 
Rn 
extends  by  continuity  to H m (Rn ) × H −m (Rn )  (for  each  ﬁxed m) when 
it  identiﬁes  H −m (Rn )  as  the  dual  of  H m (Rn ).  This  was  our  ‘picture’ 
at  the  beginning. 
For  m  >  0  the  spaces  H m (Rn )  represents  elements  of  L2 (Rn )  that 
have  “m” derivatives  in L2 (Rn ).  For m < 0  the  elements  are  ??  of “up 
to −m”  derivatives  of  L2  functions.  For  integers  this  is  precisely  ??.
