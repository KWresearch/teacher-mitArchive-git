13.  Homogeneous  distributions 

Next  time  I  will  talk  about  homogeneous  distributions.  On  R  the 
functions 
 

x > 0
�
sx
x < 0 
0 
where  S  � R,  is  locally  integrable  (and  hence  a  tempered  distribution) 
precisely  when  S  >  −1.  As  a  function  it  is  homogeneous  of  degree  s. 
Thus  if  a > 0  then 

s x  = 
t 

µs (ax)(�) = 

µs(ax)�(x) dx 

(ax)s  = a x  .
s s
t

t
s

Thinking  of  x = µs  as  a  distribution  we  can  set  this  as 
t 
 


 


s = a µs (�) . 
Thus  if  we  deﬁne  �a (x) =  1 �( x ),  for  any  a > 0,  � � S (R)  we  can  ask 
a 
a
whether  a  distribution  is  homogeneous: 
s 
µ(�a ) = a µ(�)  � � � S (R).
