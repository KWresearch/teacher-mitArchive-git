Solution	 18.1  (To   Problem  10).  (by  Matjaˇz  Konvalinka). 
Since  the  topology  on  N,  inherited   from  R,  is   discrete,  a  set   is  com­
pact  if  and  only   if   it  is  ﬁnite.  If   a  sequence  {xn} (i.e.  a  function  N
C)→
is  in  C0 (N)  if  and  only  if  for  any  � >  0  there  exists  a  compact   (hence 
ﬁnite)  set  F�  so  that  |xn | <  �  for  any  n  not   in   F� .  We  can   assume  that  
F�  =  {1, .  .  .  , n�},  which  gives  us  the  condition   that  {xn}  is   in  C0 (N) 
if  and  only  if  it   converges  to  0.  We  denote  this  space  by  c0 ,  and  the  
supremum  norm  by   � · �0 .  A  sequence  {xn}  will  be  abbreviated  to  x.

We  can  deﬁne  pointwise  summation   and   multiplication   with   scalars,

is  a  (linear)  well­deﬁned  mapping  with  norm  at   most  1.  In  fact,  Φ  is

Solution  18.3  (To  Problem  40).  (Matjaˇz  Konvalinka)   Let   us  prove  this  
in  the  case  where  n  = 1.   Deﬁne  (for  b  = 0) 
U (x) =  u(b) − u(x) − (b − x)u� (x) − .  .  .  −

For  the  continuously  diﬀerentiable   function   V (x) =  U (x)−(1−x/b)kU (0)  
we  have  V (0)  =  V (b)  =  0,  so  by  Rolle’s  theorem   there  exists  ζ  between 
0  and  b  with 

V � (ζ ) =  U � (ζ ) + 

Then

for  ζ  between  0  and  x,  and   since  u(k)  is   continuous,  (u(x) − p(x))/xk 
tends  to   0   as  x  tends  to  0. 
The  proof   for   general  n  is   not   much  more  diﬃcult.  Deﬁne   the  func­

so  by  above  u(x) =  wx (1)   is  the  sum  of  some  polynomial   p  (od  degree

Solution  18.4  (Solution  to  Problem  41).  (Matjˇz  Konvalinka) Obviously 
the  map  C0 (Bn ) → C (Bn ) is  injective  (since  it   is  just   the  inclusion   map), 
and  f  ∈  C (Bn )  is  in  C0 (Bn )  if  and  only  if  it   is  zero  on   ∂Bn  ,  ie.  if  and 
only  if  f |Sn−1  = 0.  It  remains  to  prove  that  any  map   g  on  Sn−1  is   the

restriction  of  a  continuous  function   on  Bn  .  This  is   clear   since

so  it  suﬃces   to  show  that  xkAψ  is   bounded  for  any  k  as  |x| → ±∞.

Since  ψ(t) − cφ(t)  ≤ Ck t−k−1  in   t  ≥ 1  it  follows   from  (18.2)   that

A  similar  estimate  as  x  → −∞ follows   from  (18.1).  Now,  A  is   clearly

linear,  and  it   follows  from  the   estimates  above,  including  that  on  the

Finally  then,  given  u  ∈  S � (R)  deﬁne  v(ψ) =

Solution  18.10   (Solution  to  Problem31).  We  know  that   δ  ∈ H m (Rn )
