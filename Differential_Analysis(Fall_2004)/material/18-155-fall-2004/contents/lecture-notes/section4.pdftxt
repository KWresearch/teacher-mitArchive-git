Here the convention  is  that  if µ(Y  � Ei ) = ⊂ but ai  = 0 then ai · µ(Y  � 
Ei ) = 0.  Clearly  this  integral  takes values  in  [0, ⊂].  More signiﬁcantly, 
if c → 0  is a constant  and f  and g  are two non-negative  (µ-measurable) 
simple  functions  then

(See  [1]  Proposition  2.13  on  page  48.) 
To  see  this,  observe  that  (4.1)  holds  for  any  presentation  (3.5)  of  f 
with  all  ai  → 0.  Indeed,  by  restriction  to  Ei  and  division  by  ai  (which 
can  be  assumed  non-zero)  it  is  enough  to  consider  the  special  case

The  Fj  can  always  be  written  as  the  union  of  a  ﬁnite  number,  N ≥ , 
of  disjoint  measurable  sets,  Fj  =  ∀l→Sj Gl  where  j  = 1, . . . , N  and 
j  ↑ {1, . . . , N ≥ }.  Thus

From  this  all  the  statements  follow  easily.

set  E  ↑ X  is

By  taking  suprema,  E  f dµ has  the  ﬁrst  and  last  properties  in  (4.2).

It also has the middle property, but  this  is  less obvious.  To see  this, we 
shall  prove  the  basic  ‘Monotone  convergence  theorem’  (of  Lebesgue). 
Before doing so however, note what the vanishing of the integral means.

Lemma  4.2.  If  f  : X  −←  [0, ⊂]  is  measurable  then  E  f dµ = 0  for  a 
�
measurable  set  E  if  and  only  if 
(4.4) 
{x ≥ E ; f (x) > 0}  has  measure  zero. 
Proof.  If  (4.4) holds,  then  any positive  simple  function bounded  above 
by f  must also vanish outside a set of measure zero, so its integral must 
 
be zero and hence  E  f dµ = 0. Conversely,  observe  that the  set  in  (4.4) 
�
can  be  written  as 
 

{x ≥ E ; f (x) > 1/n}. 
n 
Since these sets  increase with n, if  (4.4) does not hold then one of these 
must  have  positive  measure.  In  that  case  the  simple  function  n−1�En 
 
has  positive  integral  so  E  f dµ > 0.	
� 
�
Notice  the  fundamental  diﬀerence  in  approach  here  between  Rie­
mann  and  Lebesgue  integrals.  The  Lebesgue  integral,  (4.3),  uses  ap­
proximation  by  functions  constant  on  possibly  quite  nasty measurable 
sets,  not  just  intervals  as  in  the  Riemann  lower  and  upper  integrals. 
Theorem  4.3  (Monotone  Convergence).  Let  fn  be  an  increasing  se­
quence  of  non-negative  measurable  (extended)  functions,  then  f (x) = 
n�∗ fn (x)  is  measurable  and 
lim
 
�
�
E
for  any  measurable  set  E  ↑ X. 
Proof.  To  see  that  f  is measurable,  observe  that 
 

f −1 (a, ⊂] = 
f −1 (a, ⊂].
n 
n 
Since  the  sets  (a, ⊂]  generate  the  Borel  χ -algebra  this  shows  that  f  is 
measurable. 
So  we  proceed  to  prove  the  main  part  of  the  proposition,  which 
is  (4.5).  Rudin  has  quite  a  nice  proof  of  this,  [5]  page  21.  Here  I 
paraphrase  it.  We  can  easily  see  from  (4.1)  that

in  terms  of  the  natural  presentation  of  g  =

that  the  En  are measurable  and  increase  to E  shows  that 
µ(En  � Fi ) ← µ(E � Fi )

Now  for  instance  the  additivity  in  (4.1)  for  f  →  0  and  g  →  0  any 
measurable  functions  follows  from  Proposition  3.3.  Thus  if  f  →  0  is 
measurable  and  fn  is  an  approximating  sequence  as  in  the Proposition

Notice  if  f  is  µ-integrable  then  so  is  |f |. One  of  the  ob jects  we  wish 
to study  is  the  space  of  integrable  functions.  The  fact that  the  integral 
of  |f |  can  vanish  encourages  us  to  look  at  what  at  ﬁrst  seems  a  much 
more  complicated  ob ject.  Namely  we  consider  an  equivalence  relation 
between  integrable  functions 
(4.8) 
f1  ∈ f2  ∞⇔ µ({x ≥ X ; f1 (x)  ⇐= f2 (x)}) = 0. 
That  is  we  identify  two  such  functions  if  they  are  equal  ‘oﬀ  a  set  of 
measure  zero.’  Clearly  if  f1  ∈ f2  in  this  sense  then

RICHARD B.  MELROSE 

Let  E  be  the  (necessarily  measureable)  set  where  f  =  ⊂.  Indeed,  if 
this does not have measure  zero,  then  the  sequence  of  simple  functions 
n�E  ∼  f  has  integral  tending  to  inﬁnity.  It  follows  that  each  equiva­
lence class under (4.8) has a representative which  is an honest function, 
i.e.  which  is  ﬁnite  everywhere.  Namely  if  f  is  one  representative  then 
 
�
f (x)  x  /≥ E 
0 
x ≥ E 

f ≥ (x) = 

is  also  a  representative. 
We shall denote by L1 (X, µ) the space consisting of such equivalence 
classes  of  integrable  functions.  This  is  a  normed  linear  space  as  I  ask 
you  to  show  in  Problem  11. 
The monotone convergence  theorem often occurrs  in the  slightly dis­
guised  form  of  Fatou’s  Lemma. 

Lemma  4.5  (Fatou).  If  fk  is  a  sequence  of  non-negative  integrable 
functions  then

lim inf fn dµ ∼  lim inf

Proof.  Set  Fk (x) =  inf n�k  fn (x).  Thus  Fk  is  an  increasing  sequence  of 
non-negative functions with limiting function lim inf n�∗ fn  and Fk (x) ∼ 
fn (x) �  n → k .  By  the monotone  convergence  theorem

The  other  important  convergence  result  for  integrals  is  Lebesgue’s 
Dominated  convergence  theorem. 
Theorem  4.6.  If  fn  is a  sequence of  integrable  functions,  fk  ← f  a.e.5 
and  |fn | ∼ g  for  some  integrable  g  then  f  is  integrable  and

f dµ =  lim

Proof.  First  we  can make  the  sequence  fn (x)  converge  by  changing  all 
the fn (x)’s to zero on a set of measure zero outside which they converge. 
This  does  not  change  the  conclusions.  Moreover,  it  suﬃces  to  suppose 
that  the  fn  are  real-valued.  Then  consider 
hk  = g − fk  → 0 . 
Now,  lim inf k�∗ hk  =  g − f  by  the  convergence  of  fn ;  in  particular  f 
is  integrable.  By monotone  convergence  and  Fatou’s  lemma

Having  proved  Lebesgue’s  theorem  of  dominated  convergence,  let 
me  use  it  to  show  something  important.  As  before,  let  µ  be  a  positive 
measure  on  X .  We  have  deﬁned  L1 (X, µ);  let  me  consider  the  more 
general  space  Lp (X, µ).  A measurable  function 
f  : X  ← C 
is  said  to  be  ‘Lp ’,  for  1 ∼ p < ⊂,  if  |f |p  is  integrable6,  i.e., 
 
�
X 
As  before  we  consider  equivalence  classes  of  such  functions  under  the 
equivalence  relation 
(4.9) 
f  ∪ g ≤ µ {x; (f  − g )(x)  ⇐= 0} = 0 . 
We  denote  by  Lp (X, µ)  the  space  of  such  equivalence  classes.  It  is  a 
linear  space  and  the  function 

1/p 
��
|f |p  dµ 
X 
is  a  norm  (we  always  assume  1 ∼ p < ⊂,  sometimes  p = 1  is  excluded 
but  later  p = ⊂  is  allowed).  It  is  straightforward  to  check  everything 
except  the  triangle  inequality.  For  this  we  start  with 

|f |p  dµ < ⊂ . 

≡f ≡p  = 

(4.10) 

 

Lemma  4.7.  If  a → 0,  b → 0  and  0 < π < 1  then 
a � b1−�  ∼ πa + (1 − π )b 
(4.11) 
with  equality  only  when  a = b. 

Proof.  If  b  =  0  this  is  easy.  So  assume  b  >  0  and  divide  by  b.  Taking 
t = a/b  we  must  show 
t�  ∼ π t + 1 − π ,  0 ∼  t ,  0 < π < 1 . 
(4.12) 
The  function  f (t) =  t�  − π t  is  diﬀerentiable  for  t  >  0  with  derivative 
�−1  − π ,  which  is  positive  for  t  <  1  and  negative  for  t  >  1.  Thus 
π t
f (t)  ∼  f (1)  with  equality  only  for  t  = 1.  Since  f (1) =  1 − π ,  this  is 
(4.12),  proving  the  lemma.

We  use  this  to  prove  H¨older’s  inequality

Deﬁnition 4.10.  A normed space in which the underlying metric space

Theorem  4.11.  For any measure  space (X, M , µ)  the  spaces Lp (X, µ), 
1 ∼ p < ⊂,  are  Banach  spaces. 

Proof.  We  need  to  show  that  a  given  Cauchy  sequence  {fn}  converges

Next  I  want  to  return  to  our  starting  point  and  discuss  the  Riesz 
representation  theorem.  There  are  two  important  results  in  measure 
theory  that  I  have  not  covered  —  I  will  get  you  to  do  most  of  them 
in  the  problems  —  namely  the  Hahn  decomposition  theorem  and  the 
Radon-Nikodym  theorem.  For  the  moment  we  can  do  without  the 
latter,  but  I  will  use  the  former. 
So,  consider  a  locally  compact metric  space, X .  By  a Borel measure 
on  X ,  or  a  signed  Borel  measure,  we  shall  mean  a  function  on  Borel 
sets 

µ  : B (X ) ← R 
which  is  given  as  the  diﬀerence  of  two  ﬁnite  positive  Borel measures 

(4.16) 

µ(E ) = µ1 (E ) − µ2 (E ) . 

Similarly  we  shall  say  that  µ  is  Radon,  or  a  signed  Radon  measure,  if 
it can  be written  as  such a diﬀerence, with both µ1  and µ2  ﬁnite Radon 
measures.  See  the  problems  below  for  a  discussion  of  this  point. 
Let  Mﬁn (X )  denote  the  set  of  ﬁnite  Radon  measures  on  X .  This  is 
a  normed  space  with 

(4.17) 

≡ µ≡ 1  =  inf (µ1 (X ) + µ2 (X )) 

(4.18) 

f  ·  dµ . 

with  the  inﬁmum  over  all  Radon  decompositions  (4.16).  Each  signed 
Radon measure  deﬁnes  a  continuous  linear  functional  on  C 0 (X ):

Theorem  4.12  (Riesz  representation.).  If X  is  a  local ly  compact met­

Thus  the  dual  space  of  C 0 (X )  is  Mﬁn (X )  –  at  least  this  is  how  such 
a  result  is  usually  interpreted 
(C 0 (X ))≥  = Mﬁn (X ),

see  the  remarks  following  the  proof. 

Proof.  We  have  done  half  of  this  already.  Let  me  remind  you  of  the 
steps. 
We  started  with  u  ≥  (C 0 (X ))≥  and  showed  that  u =  u+  − u−  where 
±  are  positive  continuous  linear  functionals;  this  is  Lemma  1.5.  Then 
u
we  showed  that  u → 0  deﬁnes  a  ﬁnite  positive  Radon measure  µ.  Here 
µ is deﬁned by  (1.11) on open sets and µ(E ) = µ� (E ) is given by  (1.12)

on  general  Borel  sets.  It  is  ﬁnite  because 
µ(X ) = sup {u(f ) ;  0 ∼ f  ∼ 1 ,  supp f  
 X ,  f  ≥ C (X )} 
(4.20) 
∼ ≡u≡ . 
From  Proposition  2.8  we  conclude  that  µ  is  a  Radon  measure.  Since 
this  argument  applies  to u±  we  get  two  positive  ﬁnite Radon measures 
±  and  hence  a  signed  Radon measure 
µ
(4.21) 
µ = µ+  − µ−  ≥ Mﬁn (X ). 
In  the  problems  you  are  supposed  to  prove  the Hahn  decomposition 
theorem,  in  particular  in  Problem  14  I  ask  you  to  show  that  (4.21)  is 
the  Hahn  decomposition  of  µ  —  this  means  that  there  is  a  Borel  set 
E  ↑ X  such  that  µ− (E ) = 0 ,  µ+(X  \ E ) = 0. 
What  we  have  deﬁned  is  a  linear map 
(C0 (X ))≥  ← M (X ), u  ⇒−← µ . 
(4.22) 
We want  to  show  that  this  is  an  isomorphism,  i.e.,  it  is  1 − 1 and  onto. 
We  ﬁrst  show  that  it  is  1 − 1.  That  is,  suppose  µ  =  0.  Given  the 
uniqueness  of  the  Hahn  decomposition  this  implies  that  µ+  = µ−  = 0. 
So  we  can  suppose  that  u  → 0  and  µ  =  µ+  =  0  and  we  have  to  show 
that  u = 0;  this  is  obvious  since 
µ(X ) = sup {u(f );  supp u 
 X,  0 ∼ f  ∼ 1  f  ≥ C (X )} = 0 
⇔ u(f ) = 0  for  all  such  f . 
If  0  ∼  f  ≥  C (X )  and  supp f  
  X  then  f ≥  =  f /≡f ≡∗  is  of  this  type 
so  u(f )  =  0  for  every  0  ∼  f  ≥  C (X )  of  compact  support.  From 
the  decomposition  of  continuous  functions  into  positive  and  negative 
parts  it  follows  that  u(f ) = 0  for  every  f  of  compact  support.  Now,  if 
f  ≥ Co (X ),  then  given  n ≥ N  there  exists  K  
 X  such  that  |f | <  1/n 
on X \ K. As  you  showed  in  the  problems,  there  exists  � ≥ C (X )  with 
supp(�) 
 X  and � = 1 on K. Thus  if fn  = �f  then supp(fn ) 
 X  and 
≡f  − fn≡ =  sup(|f  − fn | <  1/n.  This  shows  that  C0 (X )  is  the  closure 
of  the  subspace  of  continuous  functions  of  compact  support  so  by  the 
assumed  continuity  of  u,  u = 0. 
So  it  remains  to  show  that  every  ﬁnite  Radon  measure  on  X  arises 
from  (4.22).  We  do  this  by  starting  from  µ  and  constructing  u.  Again 
we  use  the  Hahn  decomposition  of  µ,  as  in  (4.21)7 .  Thus  we  assume 
µ → 0  and  construct  u.  It  is  obvious  what  we  want,  namely

Here  we  need  to  recall  from  Proposition  3.2  that  continuous  functions 
on X , a locally compact metric space, are (Borel) measurable.  Further­
more, we know  that  there  is an  increasing  sequence  of  simple  functions 
with  limit  f ,  so

This  shows  that  u  in  (4.24)  is  continuous  and  that  its  norm  ≡u≡  ∼ 
µ(X ).  In  fact 
(4.26) 
≡u≡ = µ(X ) . 
Indeed,  the  inner  regularity  of  µ  implies  that  there  is  a  compact  set 
K  
 X  with µ(K ) → µ(X ) − 1 ; then there is f  ≥ Cc (X ) with 0 ∼ f  ∼ 1 
n 
and  f  =  1  on  K .  It  follows  that  µ(f ) → µ(K ) → µ(X ) −  1 ,  for  any  n.

This  proves  (4.26). 
We  still  have  to  show  that  if  u  is  deﬁned  by  (4.24),  with  µ  a  ﬁnite 
positive Radon measure,  then  the measure  ˜µ  deﬁned  from  u  via  (4.24) 
is  precisely  µ  itself. 
This  is  easy  provided  we  keep  things  clear.  Starting  from  µ  →  0  a 
ﬁnite  Radon measure,  deﬁne  u  by  (4.24)  and,  for  U  ↑ X  open

By  the  properties  of  the  integral,  ˜µ(U )  ∼ µ(U ).  Conversely  if  K  
  U 
there  exists  an  element  f  ≥  Cc (X ),  0  ∼  f  ∼  1,  f  =  1 on  K  and 
supp(f ) ↑ U.  Then  we  know  that

By  the  inner  regularity  of  µ,  we  can  choose  K  
 U  such  that  µ(K ) → 
µ(U ) − σ,  given  σ > 0.  Thus  ˜µ(U ) = µ(U ). 
This proves  the Riesz  representation  theorem, modulo  the decompo­
sition  of  the  measure  - which  I  will  do  in  class  if  the  demand  is  there! 
In my  view  this  is  quite  enough measure  theory.

Notice that we have in fact proved something stronger than the state­
ment of the theorem.  Namely we have shown that under the correspon­
dence  u ∃← µ, 
(4.29) 
≡u≡ =  |µ| (X ) =: ≡µ≡1  . 
Thus  the map  is  an  isometry.
