12.  Cone  support  and  wavefront  set 

In  discussing  the  singular  support  of  a  tempered  distibution  above, 
notice  that 

singsupp(u) = ∈ 
only  implies  that u ≤ C� (Rn ), not as  one might want,  that u ≤ S (Rn ). 
We  can  however  ‘reﬁne’  the  concept  of  singular  support  a  little  to  get 
this. 
Let us think of the sphere Sn−1  as the set of ‘asymptotic directions’ in 
n . That is, we identify a point in Sn−1  with a half-line {a ¯x; a ≤ (0, ⊂)} 
R
for  0  � x ≤ Rn .  Since  two  points  give  the  same  half-line  if  and  only  if 
= ¯
they  are  positive  multiples  of  each  other,  this  means  we  think  of  the 
sphere  as  the  quotient 

(12.1) 

Sn−1  = (Rn  \ {0})/R+ . 

Of  course  if  we  have  a  metric  on  Rn ,  for  instance  the  usual  Euclidean 
metric,  then we can  identify Sn−1  with  the unit sphere.  However  (12.1) 
does  not  require  a  choice  of metric. 
Now, suppose we consider functions on Rn \{0} which are (positively) 
homogeneous  of  degree  0.  That  is  f (a ¯
x) =  f ( ¯
x),  for  all  a >  0,  and 
they  are  just  functions  on  Sn−1 .  Smooth  functions  on  Sn−1  correspond 
(if you  like  by  deﬁnition)  with  smooth  functions  on Rn  \ {0} which  are 
homogeneous of degree 0. Let us take such a function υ ≤ C � (Rn \ {0}), 
υ (ax) = υ (x)  for  all  a > 0.  Now,  to make  this  smooth  on  Rn  we  need 
to  cut  it  oﬀ  near  0.  So  choose  a  cutoﬀ  function  α  ≤  C � (Rn ),  with 
c 
α(x) = 1  in  |x| < 1.  Then 

(12.2) 

υR (x) = υ (x)(1 − α(x/R)) ≤ C� (Rn ), 

for  any  R  >  0.  This  function  is  supported  in  |x|  →  R.  Now,  if  υ  has 
support  near  some  point  φ  ≤ Sn−1  then  for  R  large  the  corresponding 
function  υR  will  ‘localize  near  φ  as  a  point  at  inﬁnity  of  Rn .’  Rather 
than  try  to  understand  this  directly,  let  us  consider  a  corresponding 
analytic  construction. 
First  of all,  a  function  of the  form υR  is  a multiplier  on S (Rn ). That 
is, 

(12.3) 

υR · : S (Rn ) −∗ S (Rn ). 

To  see  this,  the main  problem  is  to  estimate  the  derivatives  at  inﬁnity, 
since the product of smooth functions  is smooth.  This  in turn amounts 
to estimating  the deriviatives  of υ  in  |x| → 1. This we  can do using  the 
homogeneity.

Lemma  12.1.  If  υ ≤ C� (Rn  \ {0})  is  homogeneous  of  degree  0  then 
|−|�|

(12.4) 
|D�υ | ∪ C� |x

Proof.  I  should  not  have  even  called  this  a  lemma.  By  the  chain  rule, 
the derivative of order � is a homogeneous function of degree −|�| from 
� 
which  (12.4)  follows. 

For  the  smoothed  versio,  υR , of  υ this  gives  the  estimates

|D�υR (x)| ∪ C� ⇒x

This  allows us  to estimate  the  derivatives  of  the product  of  a Schwartz 
function  and  υR  :

for some  seminorm  on S (Rn ). Thus  the map  (12.3)  is  actually  continu­
ous.  This  continuity  means  that  υR  is  a multiplier  on  S ≤ (Rn ), deﬁned 
as  usual  by  duality: 
υRu(f ) = u(υR f )  � f  ≤ S (Rn ). 
(12.7) 

Deﬁnition 12.2.  The cone-support and cone-singular-support of a tem­
pered  distribution  are  the  subsets  Csp(u)  ∩  Rn  ∃ Sn−1  and  Css(u)  ∩ 
n  ∃ Sn−1  deﬁned  by  the  conditions 
R
(12.8) 

Csp(u) ∀ Rn  = supp(u) 
(Csp(u))�  ∀ Sn−1  ={φ ≤ Sn−1 ;

� (Sn−1

� R > 0,  υ ≤ C
),  υ (φ )  �= 0,  υRu = 0}, 
Css(u) ∀ Rn  = singsupp(u) 
(Css(u))�  ∀ Sn−1  ={φ ≤ Sn−1 ; 
� (Sn−1
),  υ (φ )  �= 0,  υRu ≤ S (Rn )}. 
� R > 0,  υ ≤ C
That  is,  on  the  Rn  part  these  are  the  same  sets  as  before  but  ‘at 
inﬁnity’  they  are  deﬁned  by  conic  localization  on  Sn−1 . 
In  considering  Csp(u)  and  Css(u)  it  is  convenient  to  combine  Rn 
and  Sn−1  into  a  compactiﬁcation  of  Rn .  To  do  so  (topologically)  let 
us  identify  Rn  with  the  interior  of  the  unit  ball  with  respect  to  the 
Euclidean  metric  using  the  map 
x 
≤ {y ≤ Rn ; |y | ∪ 1} = Bn . 
Rn  � x ∅−∗ 
⇒x≡ 

(12.9)

Clearly  |x| <  ⇒x≡ and  for  0  ∪ a  <  1,  |x| =  a⇒x≡ has  only  the  solution 
1 
|x| = a/(1 − a2 ) 2 .  Thus  if  we  combine  (12.9)  with  the  identiﬁcation  of 
n  with  the  unit  sphere  we  get  an  identiﬁcation 
S
Rn  ∃ Sn−1  � Bn . 
(12.10) 
Using  this  identiﬁcation we  can,  and will,  regard Csp(u) and Css(u) as 
subsets  of  Bn . 21 

Lemma  12.3.  For  any  u  ≤  S ≤ (Rn ),  Csp(u)  and  Css(u)  are  closed 
subsets  of  Bn  and  if  υ˜ ≤ C� (Sn )  has  supp( υ˜) ∀ Css(u) = ∈ then  for  R 
suﬃciently  large  υ˜Ru ≤ S (Rn ). 
Proof.  Directly  from the deﬁnition we know  that Csp(u) ∀ Rn  is closed, 
as  is Css(u) ∀ Rn . Thus,  in  each  case, we need  to  show  that  if φ ≤ Sn−1 
and φ  /≤ Csp(u)  then Csp(u)  is  disjoint  from  some neighbourhood  of φ 
in  Bn . However,  by  deﬁnition, 
= 0} ∃ {φ ≤  ≤ Sn−1 ; υ (φ ≤)  �
U  = {x ≤ Rn ; υR (x)  �
= 0}
is  such  a  neighbourhood.  Thus  the  fact  that  Csp(u)  is  closed  follows 
directly  from  the deﬁnition.  The  argument  for Css(u)  is essentially  the 
same. 
The  second  result  follows  by  the  use  of  a  partition  of  unity  on  Sn−1 . 
Thus,  for each point in supp(υ ) ∩ Sn−1  there exists a conic localizer for 
which υRu ≤ S (Rn ). By compactness we may choose a ﬁnite number of 
these  functions  υj  such  that  the  open  sets  {υj (φ ) > 0} cover  supp( υ˜). 
By  assumption  (υj )Rj u  ≤  S (Rn )  for  some  Rj  >  0.  However  this  will 
remain  true  if  Rj  is  increased,  so  we  may  suppose  that  Rj  =  R  is 
independent  of  j.  Then  for  function 
µ = � 
|υj |2  ≤ C� (Sn−1 ) 
j 
we  have  µRu ≤ S (Rn ). Since υ˜ = υ ≤µ  for  some  µ ≤ C� (Sn−1 )  it  follows 
that  υ˜
R+1u ≤ S (Rn )  as  claimed. 
� 
Corollary  12.4.  If  u  ≤  S ≤ (Rn )  then  Css(u) =  ∈  if  and  only  if  u  ≤ 
S (Rn ). 

Proof.  Certainly  Css(u) = ∈ if  u ≤ S (Rn ).  If  u ≤ S ≤ (Rn )  and  Css(u) = 
∈  then  from  Lemma  12.3,  υRu  ≤  S (Rn )  where  υ  = 1.  Thus  v  = 
(1 − υR )u  ≤ C −� (Rn )  has  singsupp(v ) =  ∈ so  v  ≤ C� (Rn)  and  hence 
c 
c
u ≤ S (Rn ).

21In  fact  while  the  topology  here  is  correct  the  smooth  structure  on  Bn  is  not 
the  right  one  –  see  Problem??  For  our  purposes  here  this  issue  is  irrelevant.

Of  course  the  analogous  result  for  Csp(u),  that  Csp(u) =  ∈  if  and 
only  if  u  =  0  follows  from  the  fact  that  this  is  true  if  supp(u) =  ∈.  I 
will  treat  a  few  other  properties  as  self-evident.  For  instance 
(12.11) 
Csp(χu) ∩ Csp(u),  Css(χu) ∩ Css(u)  � u ≤ S ≤ (Rn ),  χ ≤ S (Rn ) 

and 

(12.12)  Csp(c1u1  + c2u2 ) ∩ Csp(u1 ) ∃ Csp(u2 ), 
Css(c1u1  + c2u2 ) ∩ Css(u1 ) ∃ Css(u2) 
� u1 , u2  ≤ S ≤ (Rn ),  c1 , c2  ≤ C. 

One  useful  consequence  of  having  the  cone  support  at  our  disposal 
is  that  we  can  discuss  suﬃcient  conditions  to  allow  us  to multiply  dis­
tributions; we will  get better conditions  below using  the  same  idea but 
applied  to  the  wavefront  set  but  this  preliminary  discussion  is  used 
there.  In  general  the  product  of  two  distributions  is  not  deﬁned,  and 
indeed  not  deﬁnable,  as  a  distribution.  However,  we  can  always multi­
ply  an  element  of  S ≤ (Rn )  and  an  element  of  S (Rn ). 
To  try  to  understand  multiplication  look  at  the  question  of  pairing 
between  two  distributions. 

Lemma  12.5.  If  Ki  ∩  Bn ,  i  = 1, 2,  are  two  disjoint  closed  (hence 
compact)  subsets  then  we  can  deﬁne  an  unambiguous  pairing 

(12.13) 
≤
{u ≤ S ≤ (Rn ); Css(u) ∩ K1} × {u ≤ S (Rn ); Css(u) ∩ K2 } � (u1 , u2 ) 
−∗ u1 (u2 ) ≤ C. 

Proof.  To  deﬁne  the  pairing,  choose  a  function  υ  ≤ C � (Sn−1 )  which  is 
identically equal to 1 in a neighbourhood of K1 ∀ Sn−1  and with support 
disjoint  from K2  ∀ Sn−1 . Then  extend  it  to  be  homogeneous,  as  above, 
and cut oﬀ to get υR . If R  is  large enough Csp(υR )  is disjoint  from K2 . 
Then  υR  + (1 − υ )R  =  1 + �  where  �  ≤ C� (Rn ). We  can  ﬁnd  another 
c 
function µ ≤ C� (Rn ) such  that υ1  = υR + µ = 1  in a neighbourhood of 
c 
K1  and  with  Csp(υ1 )  disjoint  from  K2 .  Once  we  have  this,  for  u1  and 
2  as  in  (12.13), 
u

(12.14) 

υ1u2  ≤ S (Rn )  and  (1 − υ1 )u1  ≤ S (Rn ) 

since in both cases Css is empty from the deﬁnition.  Thus we can deﬁne 
the  desired  pairing  between  u1  and  u2  by 

(12.15) 

u1 (u2 ) = u1 (υ1u2 ) + u2 ((1 − υ1 )u1 ). 

LECTURE  NOTES  FOR  18.155,  FALL  2004 

87 

Of  course  we  should  check  that  this  deﬁnition  is  independent  of  the 
cut-oﬀ function used in it.  However,  if we go through the deﬁnition and 
choose  a  diﬀerent  function  υ ≤  to  start  with,  extend  it  homogeneoulsy 
and  cut  oﬀ  (probably  at  a diﬀerent R)  and  then  ﬁnd  a  correction  term 
≤  then  the  1-parameter  linear  homotopy  between  them 
µ
≤ , t ≤ [0, 1] 
(12.16) 
υ1 (t) = tυ1  + (1 − t)υ1
satisﬁes  all  the  conditions  required  of  υ1  in  formula  (12.14).  Thus  in 
fact  we  get  a  smooth  family  of  pairings,  which  we  can  write  for  the 
moment  as 
(u1 , u2 )t  = u1 (υ1 (t)u2 ) + u2((1 − υ1 (t))u1 ). 
(12.17) 
By  inspection,  this  is  an  aﬃne-linear  function  of  t  with  derivative 
≤ )u2) + u2 ((υ ≤  − υ1 ))u1 ).
(12.18) 
u1 ((υ1  − υ1
1 
Now,  we  just  have  to  justify moving  the  smooth  function  in  (12.18)  to 
see  that  this  gives  zero.  This  should  be  possible  since  Csp(υ ≤  − υ1 )  is 
1 
disjoint  from  both  K1  and K2 . 
In  fact,  to  be  very  careful  for  once,  we  should  construct  another 
function  α  in  the  same  way  as  we  constructed  υ1  to  be  homogenous 
near inﬁnity and smooth and such that Csp(α) is also disjoint from both 
1  and K2  but  α = 1  on  Csp(υ ≤  − υ1 ).  Then  α(υ ≤  − υ1 ) = υ ≤  − υ1  so

(12.19)  u1 ((υ1  − υ1
≤ )αu1 ) = u2 (υ1  − υ1
≤ )αu1 ). 
= (αu2 )(υ1  − υ1
Here  the  second  equality  is  just  the  identity  for  α  as  a  (multiplica­
tive)  linear map  on  S (Rn )  and  hence  S ≤ (Rn )  and  the  operation  to  give 
the  crucial,  third,  equality  is  permissible  because  both  elements  are  in 
S (Rn ). 
� 

Once we have deﬁned the pairing between tempered distibutions with 
disjoint conic singular supports,  in the sense of  (12.14), (12.15), we can 
deﬁne  the  product  under  the  same  conditions.  Namely  to  deﬁne  the 
product  of  say  u1  and  u2  we  simply  set 

(12.20)  u1u2 (χ) = u1 (χu2 ) = u2 (χu1 )  � χ ≤ S (Rn ), 
provided  Css(u1 ) ∀ Css(u2 ) = ∈. 
Indeed,  this  would  be  true  if  one  of  u1  or  u2  was  itself  in  S (Rn )  and 
makes  sense  in  general.  I  leave  it  to  you  to  check  the  continuity  state­
ment  required  to  prove  that  the  product  is  actually  a  tempered  disti­
bution  (Problem  78).

One  can also give  a  similar discussion  of the  convolution  of  two  tem­
pered distributions.  Once again we do not have a deﬁnition of u � v as a 
tempered  distribution  for  all  u, v ≤ S ≤ (Rn ). We  do  know  how  to deﬁne 
the  convolution  if  either  u or  v  is  compactly  supported,  or  if  either  is 
in  S (Rn ). This  leads  directly  to 
Lemma  12.6.  If Css(u) ∀ Sn−1  = ∈ then u � v is deﬁned unambiguously 
by 

(12.21) 

x 
u � v = u1  � v + u2  � v ,  u1  = (1 − α(  ))u,  u2  = u − u1 
r 
where  α ≤ C� (Rn )  has  α(x) = 1  in  |x| ∪ 1  and  R  is  suﬃciently  large; 
c 
there  is  a  similar  deﬁnition  if  Css(v ) ∀ Sn−1  = ∈. 
Proof.  Since Css(u) ∀ Sn−1  = ∈, we  know  that Css(u1 ) = ∈ if R is  large 
enough,  so  then both terms on the  right  in (12.21) are well-deﬁned.  To 
see  that  the  result  is  independent  of R just  observe  that  the  diﬀerence 
of  the  right-hand  side  for  two  values  of  R is  of  the  form  w � v − w � v 
with  w compactly  supported. 
� 

Now,  we  can  go  even  further  using  a  slightly  more  sophisticated 
decomposition  based  on 
Lemma  12.7.  If  u ≤ S ≤ (Rn )  and  Css(u) ∀ � = ∈ where  � ∩ Sn−1  is  a 
closed  set,  then  u = u1 + u2  where  Csp(u1 ) ∀ � = ∈ and  u2  ≤ S (Rn );  in 
fact 

≤≤ 
(12.22)  u = u1  + u1  + u2  where  u1  ≤ C −� (Rn )  and

Proof.  A  covering  argument  which  you  should  provide. 
� 
Let  �i  ∩ Rn ,  i = 1, 2, be  closed  cones.  That  is  they  are  closed  sets 
such  that  if  x ≤ �i  and  a > 0  then  ax ≤ �i . Suppose  in  addition  that 
(12.23) 
�1  ∀ (−�2 ) = {0}. 
That  is,  if  x  ≤ �1  and  −x  ≤  �2  then  x  = 0.  Then  it  follows  that  for 
some  c > 0, 
(12.24) 
x ≤ �1 ,  y ≤ �2  =∞ |x + y | → c(|x| + |y |). 
To  see  this  consider  x + y  where  x  ≤  �1 ,  y  ≤  �2  and  |y |  ∪  |x|.  We 
can  assume  that  x  �= 0,  otherwise  the  estimate  is  trivially  true  with 
c = 1, and  then  Y  = y/|x| ≤ �1  and X  = x/|x| ≤ �2  have  |Y | ∪ 1  and 
|X | = 1. However X + Y  �= 0, since  |X | = 1, so by  the continuity  of the 
sum,  |X + Y | → 2c > 0  for  some  c > 0. Thus  |X + Y | → c(|X | + |Y |) 
and  the  result  follows  by  scaling  back.  The  other  case,  of  |x|  ∪  |y |

follows  by  the  same  argument  with  x  and  y  interchanged,  so  (12.24)  is 
a  consequence  of  (12.23). 

Lemma  12.8.  For  any  u ≤ S ≤ (Rn )  and  χ ≤ S (Rn ), 
Css(χ � u) ∩ Css(u) ∀ Sn−1 . 
(12.25) 
Proof.  We already know that χ�u is smooth, so Css(χ�u) ∩ Sn−1 . Thus, 
we  need  to  show  that  if  φ ≤ Sn−1  and  φ  /
≤ Css(u)  then  φ  /
≤ Css(χ � u).
Fix  such  a  point  φ  ≤ Sn−1  \ Css(u)  and  take  a  closed  set  �  ∩ Sn−1 
which is a neighbourhood of φ but which is still disjoint from Css(u) and 
then  apply  Lemma  12.7.  The  two  terms  χ � u2 ,  where  u2  ≤ S (Rn )  and 
χ � u1  where  u≤  ≤ C −� (Rn)  are both  in S (Rn )  so we  can  assume  that u
≤
1 
c 
has  the  support properties  of u1 .  In particular  there  is  a  smaller  closed 
≤≤
subset  �1  ∩ Sn−1  which  is  still  a  neighbourhood  of  φ  but  which  does 
not meet �2 , which  is  the  closure  of  the complement  of �.  If we  replace 
these  �i  by  the  closed  cones  of which  they  are  the  ‘cross-sections’  then 
we  are  in  the  situation  of  (12.23)  and  (12.23),  except  for  the  signs. 
That  is,  there  is  a  constant  c > 0  such  that 
(12.26) 
|x − y | → c(|x| + |y |). 
Now,  we  can  assume  that  there  is  a  cutoﬀ  function  υR  which  has 
support  in �2  and  is  such  that u = υRu. For any  conic  cutoﬀ, υ ≤ 
R , with 
support  in  �1 
(12.27)  υ ≤ 
R (χ � u) = ⇒υRu, χ(x − ·)≡ = ⇒u(y ), υR(y )υ ≤
R (x)χ(x − y )≡. 
The  continuity  of  u  means  that  this  is  estimated  by  some  Schwartz 
seminorm

y (υR (y )υ ≤

∪ CN �χ� sup(1 + |x| + |y |)−N (1 + |y |)k  ∪ CN �χ�(1 + |x|)−N +k 
y 
for  some  Schwartz  seminorm  on  χ.  Here  we  have  used  the  estimate 
(12.24),  in  the  form  (12.26),  using  the  properties  of  the  supports  of 
≤  and  υR .  Since  this  is  true  for  any  N  and  similar  estimates  hold 
υ
R 
for  the  derivatives,  it  follows  that  υ ≤ 
R (u � χ)  ≤  S (Rn )  and  hence  that 
φ  /≤ Css(u � χ).

Corollary  12.9.  Under  the  conditions  of  Lemma  12.6 
(12.29)  Css(u � v ) ∩ (singsupp(u) + singsupp(v )) ∃ (Css(v ) ∀ Sn−1 ). 

Proof.  We  can  apply  Lemma  12.8  to  the  ﬁrst  term  in  (12.21)  to  con­
clude  that  it  has  conic  singular  support  contained  in  the  second  term 
in  (12.29).  Thus  it  is  enough  to  show  that  (12.29)  holds  when  u  ≤

C −�(Rn ).  In  that  case  we  know  that  the  singular  support  of  the  con-
c 
volution  is  contained  in  the  ﬁrst  term  in  (12.29),  so  it  is  enough  to 
consider  the  conic  singular  support  in  the  sphere  at  inﬁnity.  Thus,  if 
φ  /
≤  Css(u � v ).  Using  Lemma  12.7 
≤  Css(v )  we  need  to  show  that  φ  /
we  can  decompose  v  =  v1  + v2  + v3  as  a  sum  of  a  Schwartz  term,  a 
compact supported  term and a term which does not have φ  in  its conic 
support.  Then  u � v1  is  Schwartz,  u � v2  has  compact  support  and  sat­
isﬁes  (12.29)  and  φ  is  not  in  the  cone  support  of  u � v3 .  Thus  (12.29) 
holds  in  general.

Lemma  12.10.  If  u,  v  ≤  S ≤ (Rn )  and  φ  ≤  Css(u) ∀ Sn−1  =∞  −φ  ≤/

is  well-deﬁned  by  Lemma  12.5.  Continuity  follows  from  your  work  in 
Problem  78. 
� 
In  Problem  79  I  ask  you  to  get  a  bound  on  Css(u � v ) ∀ Sn−1  under 
the  conditions  in  Lemma  12.10. 
Let me  do  what  is  actually  a  fundamental  computation. 

Lemma  12.11.  For  a  conic  cutoﬀ,  υR ,  where  υ  ≤ C� (Sn−1 ), 
Css( �υR ) ∩ {0}. 
(12.32) 
Proof.  This  is  actually  much  easier  than  it  seems.  Namely  we  already 
know  that  D� (υR )  is  smooth  and  homogeneous  of  degree  −|�|  near 
inﬁnity.  From  the  same  argument  it  follows  that 
D� (x � υR ) ≤ L2 (Rn )  if  |�| > |� | + n/2 
(12.33) 
since  this  is  a  smooth  function  homogeneous  of  degree  less  than  −n/2 
near  inﬁnity,  hence  square-integrable.  Now,  taking  the  Fourier  trans­
form  gives 

γ �D� ( �υR ) ≤ L2 (Rn )  � |�| >  |� | + n/2. 
(12.34) 
If  we  localize  in  a  cone  near  inﬁnity,  using  a  (completely  unrelated) 
cutoﬀ  υ ≤ 
R� (γ )  then  we must  get  a  Schwartz  function  since 
(12.35) 
R� (γ ) �
R� (γ )D� ( �
|γ ||�|υ ≤ 
υR ) ≤ L2 (Rn )  � |�| > |� | + n/2 =∞ υ ≤ 
υR  ≤ S (Rn ).

Indeed  this  argument  applies  anywhere  that  γ  �=  0  and  so  shows  that 
� 
(12.32)  holds. 

Now,  we  have  obtained  some  reasonable  looking  conditions  under 
which the product uv  or the convolution u � v of two elements of S ≤ (Rn) 
is deﬁned.  However,  reasonable as they might be there is clearly a ﬂaw, 
or at least a deﬁciency,  in the discussion.  We know  that in the simplest 
of  cases, 
u � v = u�
� v . 
(12.36) 
�
Thus,  it is very natural to expect a relationship between  the conditions 
under  which  the  product  of  the  Fourier  transforms  is  deﬁned  and  the 
conditions  under  which  the  convolution  is  deﬁned.  Is  there?  Well,  not 
much  it would  seem,  since on the one hand we are considering  the  rela­
tionship  between  Css(�u)  and  Css(�v )  and  on  the  other  the  relationship 
between  Css(u) ∀ Sn−1  and  Css(v ) ∀ Sn−1 .  If  these  are  to  be  related, 
we  would  have  to  ﬁnd  a  relationship  of  some  sort  between  Css(u)  and 
Css(�u).  As  we  shall  see,  there  is  one  but  it  is  not  very  strong  as  can 
be  guessed  from  Lemma  12.11.  This  is  not  so  much  a  bad  thing  as  a 
sign  that we  should  look  for  another  notion which  combines  aspects  of 
both  Css(u)  and  Css(�u).  This  we  will  do  through  the  notion  of  wave­
front  set.  In  fact  we  deﬁne  two  related  ob jects.  The  ﬁrst  is  the  more 
conventional,  the  second  is more  natural  in  our  present  discussion. 
Deﬁnition  12.12.  If  u  ≤ S ≤ (Rn )  we  deﬁne  the  wavefront  set  of  u  to 
be 

(12.37)  WF(u) = {(x, φ ) ≤ Rn  × Sn−1 ; 
≤ Css(�
χu)}� 
� χ ≤ C� (Rn), χ(x)  �
= 0,  φ  /
c 
and  more  general ly  the  scattering  wavefront  set  by 

(12.38)  WFsc (u) = WF(u) ∃ {(φ , p) ≤ Sn−1  × Bn ; 
≤ Css( �
υRu)}� . 
� υ  ≤ C� (Sn ), υ (φ )  �
= 0,  R > 0  such  that  p  /
So,  the  deﬁnition  is  really  always  the  same.  To  show  that  (p, q )  /≤ 
WFsc (u)  we  need  to  ﬁnd  ‘a  cutoﬀ  �  near  p’  –  depending  on  whether 
p ≤ Rn  or  p ≤ Sn−1  this  is  either  � = χ ≤ C� (Rn )  with  F  =  χ(p)  �=  0 
c 
≤ Css( �
or  a  υR  where  υ  ≤ C� (Sn−1 )  has  υ (p)  �
=  0  –  such  that  q  /
�u). 
One  crucial  property  is 
Lemma  12.13.  If  (p, q )  /≤  WFsc (u)  then  if  p  ≤  Rn  there  exists  a 
neighbourhood  U  ∩  Rn  of  p  and  a  neighbourhood  U  ∩  Bn  of  q  such 
that  for  al l  χ ≤ C� (Rn )  with  support  in  U,  U ≤  ∀ Css(�χu) = ∈;  similarly

Since  we  know  that  �χu  ≤ C� (Rn ),  this  is  actually  true  for  all  R  >  0 
as  soon  as  it  is  true  for  one  value.  Furthermore,  if  χ≤  ≤ C� (Rn )  has

converse,  that  ¯ ≤ singsupp(u) implies  ( ¯
is  immediate. 
The argument to prove the second part of  (12.43) is similar.  Since, by 
deﬁnition, WFsc (u)∀(Rn×Bn ) = WF(u) and Css(u)∀Rn  = singsupp(u) 
we only need  consider points  in Css(u) ∀ Sn−1 . Now, we ﬁrst check  that 
if  β  /≤  Css(u)  then  {β} × Bn  ∀ WFsc (u) =  ∈.  By  deﬁnition  of  Css(u) 
there  is  a  cut-oﬀ  υR ,  where  υ  ≤  C� (Sn−1 )  and  υ (β)  �= 0,  such  that 
υRu  ≤ S (Rn ).  From  (12.38)  this  implies  that  (β , p)  /≤  WFsc (u)  for  all 
p ≤ Bn . 
Now,  Lemma  12.13  allows  us  to  apply  the  same  argument  as  used 
above  for  WF .  Namely  we  are  given  that  (β , p)  /≤  WFsc (u)  for  all 
p  ≤  Bn .  Thus,  for  each  p  we  may  ﬁnd  υR ,  depending  on  p,  such  that 
≤  Css( �
υRu).  Since  Bn  is  compact,  we  may  choose  a 
υ (β)  �
=  0  and  p  /
ﬁnite  subset  of  these  conic  localizers,  υ (j )  such  that  the  intersection 
Rj 
�
of  the  corresponding  sets  Css( υ (j )u),  is  empty,  i.e.  their  complements 
Rj 
cover Bn . Now,  using Lemma  12.13 we may  choose  one υ  with  support 
in  the  intersection  of  the  sets  {υ (j )  �
=  0  and  one  R 
= 0}  with  υ (β)  �
such  that Css( �υRu) = ∈, but  this  just means  that υRu ≤ S (Rn )  and  so 
β  /≤ Css(u)  as  desired. 
The  fact  that  these  sets  are  closed  (in  the  appropriate  sets)  follows 
directly  from  Lemma12.13. 
� 
Corollary  12.15.  For  u ≤ S ≤ (Rn ), 
(12.44) 
WFsc (u) = ∈ ≥∞ u ≤ S (Rn ). 
Let me return to the deﬁnition of WFsc (u) and rewrite  it, using what 
we  have  learned  so  far,  in  terms  of  a  decomposition  of  u. 
Proposition  12.16.  For  any  u ≤ S ≤ (Rn )  and  (p, q ) ≤ ω (Bn  × Bn ), 

(12.45)  (p, q )  /≤ WFsc (u) ≥∞ 
u = u1  + u2 , u1 , u2  ≤ S ≤ (Rn),  p  /
≤ Css(u1 ), q  /
≤ Css( u�2 ). 
Proof.  For  given  (p, q )  /≤  WFsc (u),  take  � =  χ  ≤  C� (Rn )  with  χ  ⇐  1
c 
near  p,  if  p  ≤ Rn  or  �  =  υR  with  υ  ≤ C� (Sn−1 )  and  υ  ⇐ 1  near  p,  if 
p ≤ Sn−1 .  In  either  case  p  /≤ Css(u1 )  if  u1  = (1 − �)u  directly  from  the 
deﬁnition.  So  u2  = u − u1  = �u.  If  the  support  of �  is  small  enough  it 
follows  as  in  the  discussion  in  the  proof  of  Proposition  12.14  that 
q  /≤ Css( u�2 ).

Thus  we  have  (12.45)  in  the  forward  direction. 
For reverse  implication  it  follows directly  that (p, q )  /≤ WFsc (u1 ) and 
that  (p, q )  /≤ WFsc (u2 ).

This  restatement  of  the  deﬁnition  makes  it  clear  that  there  a  high

q  /≤ Css( u�2).  Hence  equivalent  to

Now,  we  can  exploit  these  notions  to  reﬁne  our  conditions  under 
which  pairing,  the  product  and  convolution  can  be  deﬁned.

(12.50)  uv ≤ S (Rn )  is  unambiguously  deﬁned  provided

and 

(12.51)  u � v  ≤ S ≤ (Rn )  is  unambiguously  deﬁned  provided 
(β , q ) ≤ WFsc (u) ∀ (Sn−1  × Bn ) =∞ (−β , q )  /≤ WFsc (v ). 
Proof.  Let us consider convolution ﬁrst.  The hypothesis,  (12.51) means 
that  for  each  β ≤ Sn−1 
(12.52) 
{q ≤ Bn−1 ; (β , q ) ≤ WFsc (u)} ∀ {q ≤ Bn−1 ; (−β , q ) ≤ WFsc (v )} = ∈. 
Now,  the  fact  that  WFsc  is  always  a  closed  set  means  that  (12.52) 
remains  true  near  β  in  the  sense  that  if U  ∩ Sn−1  is  a  suﬃciently  small 
neighbourhood  of  β  then

The  compactness  of  Sn−1  means  that  there  is  a  ﬁnite  cover  of  Sn−1  by 
such  sets  Uj .  Now  select  a  partition  of  unity  υi  of  Sn−1  which  is  not 
only  subordinate  to  this  open  cover,  so  each  υi  is  supported  in  one  of 
the  Uj  but  satisﬁes  the  additional  condition  that 

(12.54)  supp(υi ) ∀ (− supp(υi� ))  �= ∈ =∞ 
supp(υi ) ∃ (− supp(υi� )) ∩ Uj  for  some  j. 
Now,  if  we  set  ui  =  (υi )Ru,  and  vi�  =  (υi� )R v ,  we  know  that  u − � 
ui 
i 
has  compact  support  and  similarly  for  v .  Since  convolution  is  already 
known  to  be  possible  if  (at  least)  one  factor  has  compact  support,  it 
suﬃces  to deﬁne ui � vi�  for every  i,  i≤ . So, ﬁrst  suppose  that  supp(υi ) ∀ 
(− supp(υi� ))  �= ∈.  In  this  case  we  conclude  from  (12.54)  that 
(12.55) 
Css( u�i ) ∀ Css( v�i� ) = ∈. 
Thus  we may  deﬁne 
(12.56) 
ui  � vi�  = uiv�i� 
� �
using  (12.20).  On  the  other  hand  if  supp υi  ∀ (− supp(υi� )) = ∈  then 
Css(ui ) ∀ (− Css(vi� )) ∀ Sn−1  = ∈ 
(12.57) 
and  in  this  case  we  can  deﬁne  ui  � vi�  using  Lemma  12.10. 
Thus with  such  a decomposition  of u and  v  all  terms  in  the convolu­
tion  are  well-deﬁned.  Of  course  we  should  check  that  this  deﬁnition  is 
independent  of  choices made  in  the decomposition.  I  leave  this  to  you. 
That the product is well-deﬁned under condition (12.50) now  follows 
if  we  deﬁne  it  using  convolution,  i.e.  as 
(12.58) 
uv = f  � g ,  f  = u,  gˇ = v . 
�
�
�
Indeed,  using  (12.47),  (12.50)  for  u  and  v  becomes  (12.51)  for  f  and 
g .
