10.  Sobolev  embedding 

The  properties  of  Sobolev  spaces  are  brieﬂy  discussed  above.  If  m 
is  a  positive  integer  then  u  →  H m (Rn )  ‘means’  that  u  has  up  to  m 
derivatives  in  L2 (Rn).  The  question  naturally  arises  as  to  the  sense 
in  which  these  ‘weak’  derivatives  correspond  to  old-fashioned  ‘strong’ 
derivatives.  Of  course  when  m  is  not  an  integer  it  is  a  little  harder 
to  imagine  what  these  ‘fractional  derivatives’  are.  However  the  main 
result  is: 

Theorem  10.1  (Sobolev  embedding).  If  u → H m (Rn )  where m > n/2 
0 (Rn ),  i.e., 
then  u → C0

(10.1) 

H m

(Rn ) � C0
0 (Rn ) ,  m > n/2 . 

Proof.  By  deﬁnition,  u → H m (Rn )  means  v  → S � (Rn)  and  ⊂π ≤m ˆu(π )  → 
L2 (Rn ).  Suppose  ﬁrst  that  u → S (Rn ).  The  Fourier  inversion  formula 
shows  that

Now,  if  m  >  n/2  then  the  second  integral  is  ﬁnite.  Since  the  ﬁrst 
integral  is  the  norm  on H m (Rn )  we  see  that

Rn 

This  is  all  for  u  →  S (Rn ),  but  S (Rn )  γ�  H m (Rn )  is  dense.  The 
estimate  (10.2)  shows  that  if  uj  �  u  in  H m (Rn),  with  uj  →  S (Rn ), 
then  uj  �  u�  in  C0 (Rn ).  In  fact  u�  =  u  in  S � (Rn)  since  uj  �  u  in 
0
L2 (Rn )  and  uj  � u in  C0 (Rn )  both  imply  that

uj α converges,  so

Notice  here  the  precise  meaning  of  u =  u ,  u → H m (Rn )  � L2 (Rn), 
� 
u →  C0 (Rn).  When  identifying  u  →  L2 (Rn)  with  the  corresponding 
0
tempered  distribution,  the  values  on  any  set  of measure  zero  ‘are  lost’. 
Thus  as  functions  (10.1) means  that  each  u → H m (Rn )  has  a  represen­
tative  u�  → C0 (Rn ). 
0
We  can  extend  this  to  higher  derivatives  by  noting  that

Proposition  10.2.  If  u → H m (Rn ),  m → R,  then  D�u → H

Proof.  First  it  is  enough  to  show  that  each  Dj  deﬁnes  a  continuous 
linear map

we  conclude  that Dj u → H m−1 (Rn )  and

Applying  this  result  we  see

Proof.  If  |�| ∀  k ,  then  D�u  →  H m−k (Rn )  �  C0 (Rn).  Thus  the  ‘weak 
0
derivatives’ D�u are continuous.  Still we have to check  that this means 
that  u  is  itself  k  times  continuously  diﬀerentiable.  In  fact  this  again 
follows  from  the density  of S (Rn )  in H m (Rn ).  The  continuity  in  (10.3) 
implies  that  if  uj  � u in H m (Rn ), m >  n  + k ,  then  uj  � u�  in  C0 (Rn)

Theorem  10.5  (Schwartz  representation).  Any  tempered  distribution 
can  be  written  in  the  form  of  a  ﬁnite  sum

Thus  every  tempered  distribution  is  a  ﬁnite  sum  of  derivatives  of 
continuous  functions  of  poynomial  growth. 
Proof.  Essentially  by  deﬁnition  any  u → S � (Rn )  is  continuous  with  re­
spect  to  one  of  the  norms  ∈⊂x≤k α∈C k .  From  the  Sobolev  embedding 
theorem  we  deduce  that,  with m > k + n/2, 
|u(α)| ∀ C ∈⊂x≤kα∈Hm  � α → S (Rn ). 
This  is  the  same  as 
�⊂x≤ u(α)� ∀ C ∈α∈Hm  � α → S (Rn ).

Lemma  10.6.  For any  �  → Nn  there are  polynomials p�,� (x)  of degrees 
0 
at  most  |� − �|  such  that 
⊂x≤k D� v = � 
D�−� �p�,� ⊂x≤k−2|�−�|v� 
��� 
Proof.  In  fact  it  is  convenient  to  prove  a more  general  result.  Suppose 
p  is  a polynomial  of  a degree  at most  j  then  there  exist  polynomials  of 
degrees  at most  j + |� − �|  such  that 
p⊂x≤k D� v = � 
D�−� (p�,� ⊂x≤k−2|�−�|v ) . 
��� 
The  lemma  follows  from  this  by  taking  p = 1. 
Furthermore, the identity  (10.11) is trivial when � = 0, and proceed­
ing by  induction we  can  suppose  it  is known whenever  |� | ∀ L.  Taking 
|� | = L + 1,

We  may  apply  the  inductive  hypothesis  to  each  of  these  terms  and 
rewrite  the  result  in  the  form  (10.11);  it  is  only  necessary  to  check  the 
order of  the polynomials,  and  recall  that  ⊂x≤2  is a polynomial of degree 
2.

Applying  Lemma  10.6  to  (10.10)  gives  (10.9),  once  negative  powers 
of  ⊂x≤  are  absorbed  into  the  continuous  functions.  Then  (10.8)  follows 
from  (10.9)  and  Leibniz’s  formula.
