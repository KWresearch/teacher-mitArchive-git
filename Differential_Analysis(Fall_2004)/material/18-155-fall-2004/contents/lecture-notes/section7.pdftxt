7.  Tempered  distributions


(7.1) 

Dj β = 

A good ﬁrst reference  for distributions  is  [2],  [4] gives a more exhaus­
tive  treatment. 
The  complete  metric  topology  on  S (Rn )  is  described  above.  Next  I 
want  to  try  to convice  you  that elements  of  its dual  space S � (Rn ), have 
enough  of  the  properties  of  functions  that  we  can  work  with  them  as 
‘generalized  functions’. 
First  let  me  develop  some  notation.  A  diﬀerentiable  function  β  : 
n  ∀ C has partial derivatives which we  have denoted  ηβ/ηxj  : Rn  ∀
R
C.  For  reasons  that  will  become  clear  later,  we  put  a  �−1  into  the 
deﬁnition  and  write 
1  ηβ 
i  ηxj 
We  say  β  is  once  continuously  diﬀerentiable  if  each  of  these  Dj β  is 
continuous.  Then  we  deﬁned  k  times  continuous  diﬀerentiability  in­
ductively  by  saying  that β  and  the Dj β  are  (k − 1)-times  continuously 
diﬀerentiable.  For  k = 2  this means  that 
Dj Dk β  are  continuous  for  j, k = 1, · · ·  , n . 
Now, recall that,  if continuous,  these second derivatives are symmetric: 
(7.2) 
Dj Dk β = DkDj β . 
This means  we  can  use  a  compact  notation  for higher  derivatives.  Put 
0  =  {0, 1, . . .};  we  call  an  element  �  ⊂ Nn  a  ‘multi-index’  and  if  β  is
N
0 
at  least  k  times  continuously  diﬀerentiable,  we  set12

β  whenever  � = �1 + �2 + + �n  √ k .

Now  we  have  deﬁned  the  spaces.

to  be  continuous!  Using  ⇒x� = (1 +  x 2 )  we  deﬁned

Proof.  This  is  Problem  7.2. 
All  this messing  about  with  norms  shows  that 
j  : S (Rn
) ∀ S (Rn
)  and Dj  : S (Rn
) ∀ S (Rn

are  continuous. 
So  now  we  have  some  idea  of  what  u  ⊂ S � (Rn )  means.  Let’s  notice 
that  u ⊂ S � (Rn )  implies 
xj u ⊂ S � (Rn )  � j  = 1, · · · , n 
(7.9)	
� (Rn )  � j  = 1, · · · , n

where  we  have  to  deﬁne  these  things  in  a  reasonable  way.  Remem­
ber  that  u  ⊂  S � (Rn )  is  “supposed”  to  be  like  an  integral  against  a 
“generalized  function” 
 
⎝
u(x)δ (x) dx  � δ  ⊂ S (Rn ). 
Rn 
Since  it  would  be  true  if  u  were  a  function  we  deﬁne 
(7.13) 
xj u(δ ) = u(xj δ )  � δ  ⊂ S (Rn ). 
Then  we  check  that  xj u ⊂ S � (Rn ): 
j u(δ ) =  u(xj δ )

Similarly  we  can  deﬁne  the  partial  derivatives  by  using  the  standard 
integration  by  parts  formula

Dj u(δ ) = −
u(Dj δ )  � δ  ⊂ S (Rn
Then  it  is  clear  that Dj u ⊂ S � (Rn ). 
Iterating  these  deﬁnition  we  ﬁnd  that  D� ,  for  any  multi-index  �,

In  general  a  linear  diﬀerential  operator  with  constant  coeﬃcients  is  a 
sum  of  such  “monomials”.  For  example  Laplace’s  operator  is

We  will  be  interested  in  trying  to  solve  diﬀerential  equations  such  as 
�u = f  ⊂ S � 
(Rn) .
We  can  also multiply  u ⊂ S � (Rn )  by  β ⊂ S (Rn ),  simply  deﬁning 
βu(δ ) = u(βδ )  � δ  ⊂ S (Rn ). 
(7.16) 
For  this  to make  sense  it  suﬃces  to  check  that

This  follows  easily  from  Leibniz’  formula. 
Now,  to  start  thinking  of  u  ⊂  S � (Rn )  as  a  generalized  function  we 
ﬁrst  deﬁne  its  support.  Recall  that 
supp(δ ) = clos {x ⊂ Rn ; δ (x) = 0} .
We  can  write  this  in  another  ‘weak’  way  which  is  easier  to  generalize. 
Namely

p  /⊂ supp(u) →  �β ⊂ S (Rn ) ,  β(p) = 0 ,  βu = 0 .
(7.19) 
In  fact  this  deﬁnition  makes  sense  for  any  u ⊂ S � (Rn ). 
Lemma  7.5.  The  set  supp(u)  deﬁned  by  (7.19)  is  a  closed  subset  of 
n  and  reduces  to  (7.18)  if  u ⊂ S (Rn ).

Proof.  The  set  deﬁned  by  (7.19)  is  closed,  since 
supp(u)�  = {p ⊂ Rn
(7.20) 
;  � β ⊂ S (Rn
), β(p) = 0,  βu = 0}
is  clearly  open  —  the  same  β  works  for  nearby  points.  If  δ  ⊂  S (Rn ) 
we  deﬁne  u�  ⊂ S � (Rn ),  which  we  will  again  identify  with  δ ,  by 
 
⎝
u� (β) =  β(x)δ (x) dx . 
(7.21) 
Obviously  u�  =  0 =≤ δ  =  0,  simply  set  β = δ  in  (7.21).  Thus  the 
map 
� (Rn )
(7.22) 
) � δ  ≡−∀ u�  ⊂ S 
S (Rn
is  injective.  We  want  to  show  that 
(7.23) 
supp(u� ) = supp(δ ) 
on  the  left  given  by  (7.19)  and  on  the  right  by  (7.18).  We  show  ﬁrst 
that 

supp(u� ) ∃ supp(δ ). 
Thus,  we  need  to  see  that  p  ⊂  supp(δ )  ≤  p  ⊂  supp(u� ).  The  ﬁrst 
/
/
condition  is  that  δ (x)  =  0  in  a  neighbourhood,  U  of  p,  hence  there 
is  a  C�  function  β  with  support  in  U  and  β(p) = 0.  Then  βδ 
⇔
0.
Conversely  suppose  p  /⊂  supp(u� ).  Then  there  exists  β  ⊂  S (Rn )  with 
β(p) = 0 and βu�  = 0,  i.e., βu� (α ) = 0 � α ⊂ S (Rn ). By the  injectivity 
� (Rn )  this means  βδ = 0,  so δ ⇔ 0  in  a  neighborhood  of 
of S (Rn ) ϕ∀ S
p  and  p  /⊂ supp(δ ). 
� 
Consider  the  simplest  examples  of  distribution  which  are  not  func­
tions,  namely  those  with  support  at  a  given  point  p.  The  obvious  one 
is  the  Dirac  delta  ‘function’ 
(7.24) 
�p(β) = β(p)  � β ⊂ S (Rn ) . 
We  can make  many  more,  because  D�  is  local 
supp(D� u) ∃ supp(u)  � u ⊂ S  (Rn) . 
� 
(7.25) 
Indeed,  p  /⊂ supp(u) ≤ � β ⊂ S (Rn ),  βu 
0,  β(p) = 0.  Thus  each  of 
the  distributions D� �p  also  has  support  contained  in ∈
⇔
{p}.  In  fact  none 
of  them  vanish,  and  they  are  all  linearly  independent.
