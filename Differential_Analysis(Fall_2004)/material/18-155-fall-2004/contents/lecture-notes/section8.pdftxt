We  have  deﬁned  an  inclusion  map

Rn 
This  allows  us  to  ‘think  of ’  S (Rn )  as  a  subspace  of  S ≥ (Rn );  that  is  we 
habitually  identify  uα  with  δ.  We  can  do  this  because  we  know  (8.1) 
to  be  injective.  We  can  extend  the map  (8.1)  to  include  bigger  spaces

but we need  to know  that these maps are  injective before we can  forget 
about  them. 
We  can  see  this  using  convolution.  This  is  a  sort  of  ‘product’  of 
0 (Rn )  and  φ  ≤  S (Rn ).  We 
functions.  To  begin  with,  suppose  v  ≤  C 0

We can use  the  same  sort of estimates  to show  that v � φ  is continuous.

To  see  that  this  is  small  for  x≥  small,  we  split  the  integral  into  two 
pieces.  Since  φ  is  very  small  near  inﬁnity,  given  ξ  >  0  we  can  choose 
R  so  large  that

The  set  |y | ∗ R  is compact and  if  |x| ∗ R ≥ ,  |x≥ | ∗ 1 then  |x + x≥  − y | ∗

Proof.  Take  k  =  0  ﬁrst.  The  subspace  Cc 
0 (Rn )  is  dense  in  C0 (Rn ),  by 
0 (Rn ) has  support  in  {|x| ∗ R} 
cutting  oﬀ outside  a  large ball.  If v ≤ Cc 
then 

→ (Rn ) ∃ S (Rn ) 
v � δt  ≤ Cc 
has  support  in  {|x| ∗ R + 1}.  Since  v � δt  ∀  v  the  result  follows  for 
k = 0. 
For  k  →  1  the  same  argument  works,  since  D � (v  � δt ) = (D�V ) � 
δt .

Corollary  8.5.  The  map  from  ﬁnite  Radon  measures 
Mﬁn (Rn ) � µ  ≡−∀ uµ  ≤ S ≥ (Rn ) 
(8.19) 
is  injective. 

Now,  we  want  the  same  result  for  L2 (Rn )  (and  maybe  for  Lp (Rn), 
1  ∗  p  <  ⊂).  I  leave  the  measure-theoretic  part  of  the  argument  to 
you. 

(8.20) 

|u(x + t) − u(x)|2  dx = 0 .

Proposition  8.6.  Elements  of  L2 (Rn )  are  “continuous  in  the  mean” 
i.e., 
�

lim 
|t|�0  Rn 
This  is  Problem  24.

Using  this  we  conclude  that

S (Rn )  ψ∀ L2 (Rn )  is  dense 
(8.21) 
as  before.  First  observe  that  the  space  of  L2  functions  of  compact 
support  is  dense  in  L2 (Rn ),  since 
�

Then  look  back  at  the  discussion  of  v  � δ,  now  v  is  replaced  by  u  ≤

when  {|x| ∗ R} large  enough.  Thus  u � δ  is  continuous  and  the  same 
argument  as  before  shows  that 
u � δt  ≤ S (Rn ) . 
Now  to  see  that  u � δt  ∀ u,  assuming  u  has  compact  support  (or  not) 
we  estimate  the  integral

Thus  we  now  know  that

L2 (Rn )  ψ∀ S (Rn )  is  injective. 
This means  that  all  our  usual  spaces  of  functions  ‘sit  inside’  S ≥ (Rn). 
Finally  we  can  use  convolution  with  δt  to  show  the  existence  of 
smooth  partitions  of  unity.  If  K  
  U  ∃  Rn  is  a  compact  set  in  an 
0 (Rn ),  with  θ  = 1 
open  set  then  we  have  shown  the  existence  of  θ  ≤ Cc 
in  some  neighborhood  of K  and  θ = 1  in  some  neighborhood  of K  and 
supp(θ ) 
 U . 
Then  consider  θ � δt  for  t  small.  In  fact 
supp(θ � δt ) ∃ {p ≤ Rn  ;  dist(p, supp θ ) ∗ 2t} 
and  similarly,  0 ∗ θ � δt  ∗ 1  and 
θ � δt  = 1  at  p  if  θ  = 1  on  B (p, 2t) . 
Using  this  we  get:

Proposition  8.7.  If  Ua  ∃ Rn  are  open  for  a  ≤  A  and  K

then there exist ﬁnitely many δi  ≤ Cc 
→ (Rn ), with 0 ∗ δi  ∗ 1, supp(δi ) ∃ 
Uai  such  that  � 
δi  = 1  in  a  neighbourhood  of  K.

Proof.  By the compactness of K  we may choose a ﬁnite open subcover. 
Using  Lemma  1.8  we  may  choose  a  continuous  partition,  π ≥ 
i ,  of  unity 
subordinate  to  this  cover.  Using  the  convolution  argument  above  we 
can  replace  π≥  by  π≥  � δt  for  t > 0.  If  t  is  suﬃciently  small  then  this  is

again  a  partition  of  unity  subordinate  to  the  cover,  but  now  smooth.

φn (x) = δ(x/n)φ (x) . 
Clearly φn  = φ  on  |x| ∗ n,  so  if  it converges  in S (Rn )  it must  converge

Proof.  From (8.23),  if φ ≤ S (Rn ),  supp(φu) ∃ supp(u).  If x � supp(u) 
then,  by  deﬁnition,  δu =  0  for  some  δ  ≤ S (Rn )  with  δ(x)  ⇒=  0.  Thus 
δ  ⇒= 0 on B (x, ξ) for ξ > 0 suﬃciently small.  If φ  ≤ C → (Rn ) has support

Now  let  us  give  a  characterization  of  the  ‘delta  function’

or  at  least  the  one-dimensional  subspace  of  S ≥ (Rn)  it  spans.  This  is

based  on  the  simple  observation  that  (xj δ)(0) = 0  if  δ ≤ S (Rn )!


Proposition  8.10.  If  u ≤ S ≥ (Rn )  satisﬁes  xj u = 0,  j  = 1, · · · , n  then

u = cα .


Proof.  The main work is in characterizing the null space of α  as a linear

functional,  namely  in  showing  that

Lemma  8.12.  The  Fourier  transform  of  the  Gaussian  exp(− |x|2 /2) 
is  the  Gaussian  (2� )n/2 exp(− |θ |2 /2). 

Proof.  There  are  two  obvious  methods  —  one  uses  complex  analysis 
(Cauchy’s  theorem) the other, which  I shall  follow, uses  the uniqueness 
of  solutions  to  ordinary  diﬀerential  equations. 
First  observe  that  exp(− |x|2 /2) = �j  exp(−xj /2).  Thus 16

being  a  function  of  one  variable.  Now  φ  satisﬁes  the  diﬀerential  equa­
tion 

(ϕx  + x) φ = 0 , 
and  is  the  only  solution  of  this  equation  up  to  a  constant multiple.  By 
(8.30)  and  (8.31)  its  Fourier  transform  satisﬁes

xφ = iθφˆ + i
This  is  the  same  equation,  but  in  the  θ  variable.  Thus  φˆ = 
Again  we  need  to  ﬁnd  the  constant.  However,
