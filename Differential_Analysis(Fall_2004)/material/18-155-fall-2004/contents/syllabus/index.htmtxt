McGraw-Hill, 1987. ISBN: 0070542341.
***** Description *****
The course materials were presented according to the following breakdown of
lectures:
    * Five lectures on measure and integration - Leading to Riesz
      representation theorem
    * Seven lectures on distributions and Fourier transform - Including Schwart
      space, Sobolev spaces and Sobolev embedding
    * Seven lectures on differential operators with constant coefficients,
      fundamental solutions and hypoellipticity
    * Four lectures on operators, trace class, Hilbert-Schmid
***** Projects *****
To pass the course each student was required to carry out one of the projects
which were described in the second week of classes. The following projects were
suggested to the students:
   1. Radon-Nikodym theorem
   2. Kuiper's theorem: The group of unitary operators on a (separable infinite
      dimensional) Hilbert space is contractible
   3. Seeley's extension theorem
   4. Gibb's phenomenon
   5. Surjectivity of any non-trivial constant coefficient differential
      operator, P: S' (Rn) â S' (Rn)
   6. Every elliptic differential operator with constant coefficients is
      surjective as a map on Câ(U), for any open set U â Rn
   7. Lidskii's theorem on trace class operators on L2(Rn)
***** Grading *****
The final grade was based on the homework and the project. There were no tests
or examinations.
