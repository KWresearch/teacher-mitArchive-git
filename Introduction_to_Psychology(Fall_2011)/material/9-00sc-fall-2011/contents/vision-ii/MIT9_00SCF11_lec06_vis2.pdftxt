Vision 2: Object Recognition


• Objects & Agnosia 
Apperceptive Agnosia

Associative Agnosia

Category-Specific Knowledge 
relation to perception & action 

AGNOSIA


Modality-specific inability to 
recognize a stimulus that is not 
explained by sensory, attentional, 
linguistic, or other defects 

AGNOSIA

Apperceptive agnosia 
• failure to construct 

conscious percept from  

sense data

• right hemisphere 
Associative agnosia 
• conscious percept (match, 

copy) stripped of meaning 

• left hemisphere

How do we know and experience objects 
in the world? 

• Visual experience (fine visual 
distinctions) 
• Functional/motor experience

• Faces 
- infant preference for faces top-
heavy bias 
- development of species-specific 
face processing 
- configural processing of faces 
- genetic preparation for face 
processing

• no early exposure

to faces 6-24 months

• before seeing a real face, 
preferred human & monkey faces 
in photographs equally, 
discriminated 
human & monkey faces 
• gained expertise for 1 month 
in exposed species 
of faces (human or monkey) only 
• Preferred only the exposed 
species vs. objects 
• Preferrence lasted for at least a 
year despite exposure to humans 
& monkeys

Adult Reading


• we read fast – can read one word that we know, 
from among 50,000 – 100,000 words that we know 
in 50 thousandths of a second! 
• typical adult reading speed is 200-250 words per minute

• we read about 12 letters at a time, then move eyes 

Moving Window Experiment 
• track eye movements (McConkie & Raynor, 1975) 
• with each movement, replace all others letters with x’s

• people did not notice the x’s

Vision 2: Object Recognition

• Faces 
- face processing as a slowly learned 
and highly specific skill 
inversion effects 
- fusiform specialization for faces 
overlap in brain between 
seeing and imagining a face 
- same-race memory superiority for 
faces

FACES 

Development of Same-Race Bias 
• not present at birth (and no 

species preference)

• present by 3 months 
• Korean children 3-9 years old 
adopted by European Caucasian 
families - better memory for 
Caucasian faces, same as French 
children, opposite of Korean 
children 

FACES 


• Identity  
• Expression (feelings) 
- six universal facial expressions 
- amygdala & fear 
- amygdala and recognition of 
fearful facial expressions
