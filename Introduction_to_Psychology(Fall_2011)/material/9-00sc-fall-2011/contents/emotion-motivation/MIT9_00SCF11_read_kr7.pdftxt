KOSSLYN CHAPTER 7 – Emotion and Motivation: Feeling and Striving 
EMOTION  4 components: 
1.	 posit ive / negative subjective experience 
2.	 bodily arousal 
3.	 activat ion of specific mental processes and stored information 
4.	
characteristic behavior 
Emot ions not only help guide us to approach some things and withdraw  from others, but also 
provide visible cues that help other people know key aspects of our thoughts and desires. 
Basic Emotion: an  innate  emotion  that  is  shared  by  all  humans   surprise , happiness, anger , fear, 
disgust , sadness
Many emot ional behaviors (the outward acts that arise from our emotions) are inborn. 
•	 People of many races and cultures use very similar facia l expressions to signa l similar

emotiona l states.

•	 Blind people show those same expressions, even if they have  never had the chance to observe
the way others look when they have particular emotional reactions.
Ekman & Friesen (1971) – investigated whether all humans perceive the same set of fundamenta l 
emotions 
•	 People in New Guinea tribe can identify the emot ions underlying facial expressions in

photographs of White faces.

•  Had difficulty with fear vs. surprise  (these 2 emotions often go  together)
Challenges to basic emot ions  some  of them are not simple 
•	 Ex: disgust –  there  are 3 different kinds; positive emotions can be divided into  5 types 
 emotions shaped by cultures, learning 
•	 Although people can recognize basic emot ions of members of other racial groups better than
would occur by chance alone , they generally recognize emotions of people from the ir own
group better than those of people from other groups. 
•	 However , this effect depended on whether the ir own group was in majority: Some members
of a minority group may actua lly recognize emot ions on faces of members of the majority
group better than they do on faces of the ir own group. What matters is how often you see 
certain kinds of faces –  the  more  you see them, the  easier  it  is to recognize emotions in them. 
Separate, but Equal Emotions  positive and negative emotions can occur at the same time , in any 
combination 
•  Supported by what happens in the brain when people experience emotions 
2 separate systems  approach (positive) = left  frontal lobe; withdrawa l (negative) = right fronta l lobe 

THEORIES OF EMOTION 
James-Lange Theory 
Event  Arousal and Physio logical Changes  Interpretation of Physio logical Changes  Emot ion 
Different emotions arise from different sets of bodily reactions.
Support: 
Some emotions (ex: anger) are accompanied by particular patterns of heart rate, body

•	
temperature, sweating, etc.

•	 Bodily changes may contribute  to emot ion (ex: changes in the muscles of your face may play a 
role in how your feel!) 
o	 Facial feedback hypothesis: the idea that emotions arise partly as a result of the
posit ioning of facial muscles 
o	
“putting on a happy face”  makes you feel happier 
Problems: 
Facial feedback hypothesis  putting on a happy  face is not the same as the genuine emotion!

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 7 – Emotion and Motivation: Feeling and Striving 
•	 There is no evidence that a specific and unique bodily state underlies each of our emotions.
Bodily responses contribute to some of our emot ions, but differences in bodily states are not 
enough to explain the range of our emotions – many emotions arise from similar bodily states. 
•	 Even people with spina l cord injuries so severe that they rece ive no sensations from their
bodies still report having emot ions, so emotions do not necessarily arise when people interpret
their own bodily states. That being said, do these people experience emotions differently than
people with intact spinal cords? 
Cannon-Bard Theory 
Event  Arousal and Physio logical Changes AND Emot ion (in tandem) 
Bodily arousal and the experience of emotion arise at the same time, and ne ither causes the other
Arousal is arousal… our bodies are aroused similarly in different arousing situations (ex: being mugged and 
winning the lottery)
Support: 
•  Fear – bodily reactions are triggered at the same time as the conscious experience of emotion 
Problems: 
•	 Meta-analyses / neuroimaging don’t show clear patterns of bodily responses that distinguish
the different emotions  Different emotions evoke overlapping patterns of brain act ivations, 
not distinct areas. 
Some emotions (but not all) are accompanied by distinct patterns of heart rate , body

temperature, sweating, and other reactions… not all arousal is the same.

Cognitive Theory
Event  Arousal and Physio logical Changes  Interpretation as a Function of Context  Emot ion 
Emot ion arises when you interpret the situat ion (i.e.: your bodily state  in the context of everything
that surrounds it)
You don’t react to a st imulus and then feel an emotion a fter the react ion, and you don’t have separate
bodily / emotional reactions. Rather , you interpret your react ions and the genera l situation together – 
and this interpretation forms the basis of emotions
Support: 
Schachter-S inger  experiment  –  participants reacted very differently to  the  adrenaline  injection,
•	
depending on what the confederate was doing; but when they were  told in advance about the
adrenaline and the fact that it causes arousal, they didn’t fee l differently in context to what the
confederate was doing. 
o	 Misa ttribution of arousal: the  failure  to  interpret signs of bodily arousal correctly,
which leads to the experience of emotions that ordinarily would not arise in the
particular situation 
Problems: 
•	 Not all emotions rely on cognitive  interpretation (ex: fear  is a reflexive  response) 
Emerging Synthesis
Event  Bra in and Body Reactions  Emotion 
 Memories and Interpretation  Emotion 
Emot ions arise  from a mixture of: 
AND 
•	 Brain and body reactions (James-Lange theory) 
Interpretations and memories pertaining to the situation  (Cannon-Bard and cognit ive  theories)
• 
Some researchers are focusing on exactly how people interpret brain and bodily reactions. 
•	 Claim that reactions produce core affect –  consists of the  “simplest  raw fee lings,” differing in 
the way they are positive or  negative,  and  the  degree  to  which  they  are  strongly  or  weakly  
activated 
•  We then unconsciously categorize changes in core affect .
Context and previous experience may lead us to categorize types of core affect in ways that fit the
situation, leading us to fee l and express different emotions.

FEAR  AMYGDALA 
•	 Arises from changes in the bra in, autonomic nervous system , hormones 
•	 Changes in behavior: when people are afraid, they tend to “freeze,” have an increased

tendency to be startled (fear-potentiated startle)

 5 Important Facts About Fear:
1.	 After you have learned  to fear an object, fear can well up later as a kind of “emotional reflex,” with no
cognitive interpretation. The  amygdala sends signa ls to other brain areas and structures (ex: the 
hypotha lamus), which in turn trigger autonomic responses (ex: your heart speeds up, your
muscles to freeze). Conscious awareness is not needed for a stimulus to trigger the amygdala
into producing fear-related responses. 
2.	 Once you learn to associate  fear with an object or situation, you will always do so. Fear  is a type  of
classically conditioned response . It can be extinguished (extinction), but even after its
extinction, the neurons that were linked by the conditioned association still fire together .
Although ext inction can block whether you express the emotion, the underlying connections
are still there. Thus, the emotion of fear is st ill associated w ith the stimulus, even though
extinction has eliminated the behaviors associated with that emot ion. Even though you are not 
aware of the association, it is never fully lost. 
In spite of the fact that cognitive interpretation is not necessary to trigger a previously learned fear
response, mental processes can alter how easily the fear  response occurs. Ex: if you just imagine 
yourself in a scary situation, you are most susceptible to being startled. You can a lso acquire
fear associations just by watching someone e lse be conditioned to fear a specific stimulus. 
4.	 The amygdala does not play a direct role in producing the emotion “feel” of fear. Patients w ith 
damaged amygda lae report experiencing positive and negative emotions as often and as
strongly as normal people do . 
In spite of the role of the amygdala in fear, neither it nor any other single brain area always gives rise to 
a particular emotion. The amygda la actually responses when people experience both strong
posit ive and negative emotions. 
 There are distinct biologica l events that are associated w ith feelings of fear (fits James-Lange 
Theory). But these are not just bodily reactions – they also  involve specific brain structures (ex:
amygda la). But this same brain structure gives rise to more than one emotion. 
 The stimuli that trigger fear produce separately both the experience and the bodily reactions at
the same time (fits Cannon-Bard Theory). 
 Cognitive events can a lter fear response (fits Cognitive Theory), but fear can also arise w ithout
requiring a person to interpret the events (does not fit Cognit ive Theory) 
 Emerging Synthesis includes roles for all of these  factors  emotion is most  consistent w ith 
this theory! 

5.	

HAPPINESS 
•	 Leads people  to broaden the scope of attent ion and to be open to new ways of understanding
and responding to events 
•	 Chronic state 
What makes us happy? 
•	 Money can buy happiness  People who  once  lived in poverty / deprivat ion tend to be
happier when they are  living in better economic conditions; but once a person has risen above
the level of poverty and deprivation, additional material resources make little – if any – 
difference  in happiness. A “blip” in happiness a fter winning the lottery / gett ing a raise . 
•	 Life circumstances  how we  are treated / pressure affects our happiness

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 7 – Emotion and Motivation: Feeling and Striving 
•	 Realistic expectations  Happy people are satisfied with their ava ilable resources, abilities 
Social support  the degree to which a person fee ls that other people are willing and able  to 
•	
listen and help 
•	 Personality  In Western countries, assertive people tend to be happier than nonassertive
people ; extraverted people tend to be happier than introverted people 
•	 Neural basis  activation of left frontal lobe. 
•	 Genetics? 
Positive Psychology: positive states of mind promote resilience (the ability to bounce back from
adversity, to keep an even keel), persona l growth, boost the immune system, he lp us cope with
disease / stress 

Emot iona l expression is crucial for our da ily interactions w ith other people .

Display rules: a  culture-specific rule that indicates when, to whom , and how strongly certain 

emotions can be shown (Ekman (1980)).

•  Ex: at funera ls, the closer the relation to the deceased, the more emot ion may be displayed 
•  All people share the same basic emotions, but they sometimes express emotions differently
because they follow different display rules.
Body language  is shaped by the display rules of a  culture; may result from innate factors 
•	 Plays a role  in conveying sexual interest (open postures show  interest; closed postures show
lack of interest) 
•	 Twin studies: genes may influence body language 
Emot iona l Regulation

We have the ability to pro long the experience of certain emotions.

We can also voluntarily reduce our emotional reactions.

Suppressing emotions is correlated w ith changes in the activation of parts of the bra in

•	
associated with emotion (ex: amygda la, hypothalamus).

•	 The frontal lobes play a key role in inhibiting processing in other parts of the brain and

apparently inhibit responses in parts of the brain that underlie sexual arousal.

Emot iona l regulation is important  for 4 reasons:
1.	
If emotions are not regulated, the behavior that results from them may  be  undesirable  and  
problematic. 
2.	 Only suppressing behavior that arises from emotions – rather than modifying the emotions 
themse lves –  can lead temporarily to  reduced cognitive  abilities (impaired memory for
surrounding events, impeded ability to reason, impaired ability to  communicate clearly). 
3.	 Regulating – modifying – emotions prevents the negative cognitive effects of suppressing the
emotiona lly driven behaviors. 
4.	 Different emot ions selectively affect different aspects of cognition, especially working memory. 
Posit ive emot ions: verbal tasks, interfere with spat ial tasks 

 Negative emotions: spatial tasks, interfere with verbal tasks 
Emot iona l Perception
We read emotions in part by interpret ing cues from other people , and in part by imitating what we 
see. 
The ability to read nonverbal communications is partly determined by experience.
When a culture makes emot ions difficult to detect through more stringent display rules, it almost
seems as though its members compensate by deve loping better abilities to detect emot ions. 
When we perceive an emotional expression, we subtly move our muscles to imitate it. Such imitation
can occur even when people are not consciously aware of having seen a face displaying a specific
emotion. Feedback from our muscles contributes to our ability to recognize emotions in others.

KOSSLYN CHAPTER 7 – Emotion and Motivation: Feeling and Striving 

MOTIVATION  the set of requirements and desires that  lead an animal to  behave in a  particular
way at a particular time and place 
Emot ions motivate us when we experience them and when we ant icipate them , but some motives are 
based on biologica l needs or drives while still others are based on learning. 
Instinct: an inherited tendency to  produce  organized and unalterable responses to particular  stimuli
Instinct Theory: explains  human  motivation  in  terms of instincts; a behavior is “hard-w ired”  (i.e .:  part  
of our inherited make-up)
Evolutionary psycho logy be lieves that we are predisposed to have certain goals and cognitive
strategies. 
•	 Problems: an instinct is a fixed behavioral pattern, but we are often not locked into very
specific responses to many stimuli; difficult to test / difficult to know what our ancestors were
like ; some values are unlikely to be the result of heredity (ex: punctuality) 
Drive: an interna l imbalance caused by the lack of a needed substance or condition that motivates 
anima ls (including humans) to reach a part icular goal that w ill reduce the imba lance.
Differ in terms of the goals to which they direct you, but all are a imed at satisfying a requirement
Drive Theory : focuses on the mechanisms that underlie tendencies / behaviors, whether or not they
are innate; drives are linked with re inforcement 
•	 Ex: when you are hungry, food reduces the imba lance experienced when you have the hunger
drive 
Homeostasis : the process of maintaining a steady state, in which bodily substances and conditions
are kept within the range in which the body funct ions well 
Arousal Theory  avoiding boredom, avo iding overload 
Yerkes-Dodson Law = parabolic curve ; we perform  best when we are at an intermediate level of arousal 
(occur when we are challenged not too much and not too little). If we are underaroused, we are
sluggish; if we are overaroused, we can’t focus and sustain attention. 
Incentive: a stimulus or event that draws animals to achieve a particular goa l in anticipation of a 
reward; the foundation of much of what motivates us
Drive v. incentive  hunger is a drive, but dessert is an incentive
Thinking about motivation in terms of expectations of re inforcement  we tend to  behave in ways that 
experience has shown us will produce a desirable outcome , e ither a posit ive consequence of the
behavior (posit ive reinforcement) or the remova l of a negative condition (negative re inforcement).
Incentives vary from person to person. 
Learned helplessness: the condition that occurs after an animal has an aversive experience in which
nothing it does can affect what happens to it , and so it simply gives up and stops trying to change the
situation or to escape 
Expt : dogs put in a cage where they cannot escape shock will eventually give up responding
•	
and just endure the shocks… even when they are moved to a new cage in which it is easy to
escape the shocks.
In humans, arises from lack of contro l over negative events  can lead to depression, stress-re lated 
problems  
A particular motivat ion comes to the fore when have a need or  a want.

Need: a condition that arises from the lack of a necessary substance (ex: food) or condition (ex:

warmth); needs give rise to drives, which push you to reach a particular goa l that w ill reduce the

need.

9.00 EXAM 2 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 7 – Emotion and Motivation: Feeling and Striving 
Want: a state that arises when you have an unmet goal that does not arise from a lack of a necessary
substance or condition; wants turn goals into incentives 
Types of Rewards: 
•	 Deprived reward: reward that occurs when an animal (including a human) lacks a substance or
condition necessary for survival and an action then produces this substance or condition; arises
from the brain pathway that runs from certain parts of the brain stem , through the hypotha lamus,
on up to specific parts of the limbic system and the fronta l lobes
Many of the neurons in this circuit use or are affected by the neurotransmitter dopamine . 
•	 Nondeprived reward: reward that occurs when the animal (including a human) does not lack a
substance or condition necessary for surviva l – in other words, when you had a want but not a
need; the brain stem is involved in nondeprived reward; dopamine has no effects here
Lesions in the brain stem knock out the system that registers reward when an animal is not deprived,
but leave  intact that system for deprived reward 
Need  Drive  Deprived Reward 
Want  Incentive  Nondeprived Reward 
Types of Needs
Psychological Needs  condition that arises from  the lack of necessary information or  the  lack of an
opportunity to exercise specific menta l processes or behave in a specific way 
•	 Ex: to be competent, to be independent , to have social approva l, to be dominant / in control,
to be affiliated with others, to be powerful, to be autonomous, to understand, to maintain self-
esteem, to see the world in a positive light 
Individua ls differ wide ly in such needs, reflective of genetic differences, different personal
•	
experiences, etc.
Need for achievement (nAch): the  need to reach goals that require skilled performance or 
competence to be accomplished 
•	 People who have a high nAch tend to assume that their successes are due to their persona l
characteristics, whereas the ir fa ilures are due to environmental circumstances; interpret events
in a way that will satisfy the ir nAch. 
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs 
Self-Actualization Needs (be  all that you are  capable  of becoming)

Aesthetic Needs (harmony and order)

Cognitive Needs (understand the world, creating curiosity)

Esteem Needs (Mastery and feeling appreciated by others)

Belongingness Needs (Sense of be longing and love)

Safety Needs (shelter , protection)

Physiological Needs (water, food, air)

Lower needs are more essentia l to  life , and must be met before needs higher up can be addressed and 

satisfied.

Once a need is met , it becomes less important, and unmet  higher-level needs become more important.

Problems: research has produced mixed evidence for the idea that  needs are organized into a hierarchy;

more important needs are more consistently met; fails to expla in various phenomena (ex: why people

voluntarily go to war and put  themse lves in the  line of fire)

Culture affects which goa ls motivate us because the structure of a society often determines what sorts

of activit ies will be reinforced.

Individualist cultures: cultures that emphasize the rights and responsibilities of the

•	
individual over those of the group (ex: Anglo-Australia)

9.00 EXAM 2 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 7 – Emotion and Motivation: Feeling and Striving 
o	 Focus on personal success, higher achievement motivation, produces competition, less
self-liking 
•	 Collectivist cultures: cultures that emphasize the  rights and responsibilit ies  of  the  group  over  
those of the individua l (ex: China) 
o	 Emphasis on family, deemphasize competition among individuals, greater self-liking 

HUNGER 
Metabolism: the sum of the chemical events in each of the body’s cells, events that convert food 
molecules to the energy needed for the cells to function 
Hunger arises from the action of 2 distinct brain systems: 
•	 One leads you to fee l a need to eat  brain senses  the level of glucose, fatty acids in the  blood 
•	 The other leads you to feel full  stomach contains detectors that register the food va lue of its
contents, sends information to brain 
Appetizer effect: if the first  bite  tastes good, your appetite w ill be  stimulated; driven by opioids in the
brain (chemicals that cause you to experience pleasure)
Changes in appetite linked to activity of the hypothalamus  Neurons in the lateral hypothalamus
init ially fire when an animal sees or tastes a food and then reduce their firing after the anima l has
eaten its fill of that food. But the neurons are se lective . After they stop responding to one food, they 
can still be stimulated by another food.
Eating with other people can lead you to eat more  or less than you would when alone, but the precise
ways in which others exert their influence are not yet known. 
Insulin: a hormone that stimulates the storage of food molecules in the form of fat 
Some of our tastes are a consequence of experience. 
•	 Cognitive taste aversion can arise from classical conditioning 
Seeing a food in contact w ith something disgusting may be enough to make you avoid eating 
•	
it. 
Food that resembles something unappealing is enough to make the food unappealing. 
•	
•	 Americans harbor exaggerated beliefs about the harmful effects of some foods (ex: salt , fat) 
•	 Beliefs play a role  in determining what we want to eat. (ex: “You are what you eat.”) 
Set point: the particular body weight that is easiest to ma intain 
•	 Body weight is re latively stable, but it can change  if your environment , activities, emotional
states, etc. change 
•	 Brain systems involved in decision making and reasoning are connected to and can
“overpower” the systems in the hypotha lamus tha t underlie hunger . WE somet imes eat not
because we’re hungry but because we’re bored or lonely, etc. 
Over-eating: eat ing when your body doesn’t need the energy. 
If you overeat for a prolonged time , the number of fat ce lls in your body increases to store the
•	
addit ional energy  gain we ight! 
It’s much harder to alter your set point so that you weigh less.

Exercise can adjust your set point downward. Exercising can speed up your metabolism , leading your

cells to need more energy even when you are not exercising. It is the best method of changing your

balance of energy input and output , and thereby of losing weight .

Theories of Obesity 

Please pardon any spelling errors or typos!

9.00 EXAM 2 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 7 – Emotion and Motivation: Feeling and Striving 
1.	 Fat Personalit ies  not  true . Obese people have the same  “willpower” to resist eating junk
food as nonobese people . According to one theory, people who become obese eat when they
feel stress, as a kind of defense… but this is not always the case . 
2.	 Fat Genes  some forms of obesity may have a genetic basis. The neurons in certain brain
involved in registering satiety appear to rely on the neurotransmitter serotonin, and mutant
mice that lack specific receptors for this neurotransmitter will keep eating until they become 
obese. If humans take medication that blocks these receptors, they w ill also gain weight;
people who take drugs that activate these receptors report be ing less hungry, actually lose
weight while on the medication. 
3.	 Fat Environment  overeating is encouraged by many aspects of the American environment
(cheap food, fast foods are high in fat , snacking is too easy and acceptable , food portions have
grown larger), we exercise less, our amusements are sedentary 
a.	 “curing the environment”  educate  people to  eat  sma ller  portions;  make  tasty  foods
that are low in fat and calories more available ; encourage more physica l activity 
b.	 Changes in environment can only be effective if the genes define a re latively w ide
range of possible we ights for the individual. 

Dieting
Diets work  for moderate weight  loss. If you want  to lose we ight, eat  fewer ca lories and exercise more!! 

SEX 
Difficult to study because of the lack of candor; studies are flawed by selection bias and response bias 
Masters & Johnson (1966) –  first to study sexua l behavior systematically 
4 stages:
1.	 Excitement (during the initia l phases, when the person becomes aroused) 
2.	 Plateau (when the person becomes fully aroused) 
3.	 Orgasm (accompanied by muscle contractions) 
4.  Resolution (the release of sexual tension)
Conclusions: 
•	 Men and women are similar in their bodily reactions to sex 
•	 Women tend to respond more slowly than men, but stay aroused longer . 
•	 Many women can have mult iple orgasms, whereas men typically have a refractory period, a
period of time follow ing orgasm, when they cannot become aroused again. 
•	 Women reported that penis size is not re lated to sexual performance unless the man is worried
about it. 
Sexual response cycle : the stages the  body passes through during sexua l activity, including sexual 
attraction, desire, excitement, and possible performance 
Hormones: chemicals that are secreted into the bloodstream (primarily by endocrine glands) and that
trigger receptors on neurons and other types of cells; controlled in a large part by the pituitary gland,
which in turn, is controlled by the hypotha lamus (plays a major ro le in emotion and motivation) 
Androgens: sex hormones that lead the body to develop many male characterist ics, such as beard
growth and a low vo ice
Estrogens: sex hormones that lead the  body  to  develop  many  female  characterist ics,  such  as  breast
development and the bone structure of the female pelvis
Both types of hormones are present  in both males and females, but males have more testosterone and 
females have more estrogen.

9.00 EXAM 2 NOTES 
KOSSLYN CHAPTER 7 – Emotion and Motivation: Feeling and Striving 
Hormones  lead  to  a  tendency  to  want  to  behave  in  certain  ways  in  the  presence  of  particular  st imuli

(i.e.: they modify motivation). 

Some people’s bodies don’t respond at all to certain sex hormones:

•	 Androgen insensitivity syndrome: in XY males, genetic mutation prevents receptors for

androgens from developing properly, genetic males develop as physical girls

Effects of shifting hormone  leve ls on desire: they are only tendencies, affect ing different people to
different degrees. 
Oxytocin: hormone produced by the pituitary gland that increases dramatically in women 
immediate ly after they give birth; helps forget the mother-infant emotional bond; released after
orgasm and may play a ro le in emotional bonding between sex partners 
Theories about Mating Preferences: 
•	 Trivers: parental investment  males are  interested in having as many offspring as possible
because they don’t need to invest much time / energy in fathering a child, look for short-term 
relationships vs. females are interested in nurturing and raising children, look for long-term 
relationships 
•	 Petersen: both men and women hope to eventua lly have a  long-term stable re lationship 
•	 Men are part icularly a lert to their mates’ possible sexual infidelity, whereas women are

particularly a lert to their mates’ becoming emot ionally involved with someone e lse 

•	 Men and women value remarkably similar characteristics in a potent ial mate 
•	 Harris (2000): asked participants to  imagine different scenarios while she recorded their blood
pressure , heart rate, and skin conduct ivity 
o  Men and women show similar reactions to imagining themse lves having sex versus
being emotionally involved with someone e lse.
Mate selection does not arise solely from events at a single level of analysis 
Sexual Orientation 
Heterosexual: a person who is sexually attracted to members of the opposite sex 
Homosexual: a  person  who  is  sexually  attracted  to  members  of  the  same  sex  
In most cases, homosexuality is not the result of personal choice or of being raised a certa in
•	
way. Much evidence indicates that biological events – particularly the functioning of the 
hypotha lamus and the  influence of genes – play a major role in determining sexua l orientation. 
•	 LeVay (1991): hypotha lamus in homosexual men is half the size as compared to heterosexual
men… confound: all homosexual men studied had AIDS 
•	 Differences in parts of the ear / auditory responses 
•	 Hamer et a l. (1993): inheritance of homosexua lity  seemed to be re lated to homosexuality in the
mother’s family; a small port ion of the X chromosome may be involved? 
•	 One intriguing possibility: effects of the womb. Homosexual men are more likely to than
heterosexua l men to have older brothers  the mother’s body “remembers”  how  many boys
she bore (by building up specific antibodies?) and alters the leve l of testosterone accordingly.
Boys with older brothers rece ive proportionally more testosterone during gestation, which
appears to increase the likelihood that they will be homosexua l. 
Some researchers have found that, on average, the relative lengths of the ring and  index  
fingers differ for homosexual and heterosexual men. This relation only occurs for gay men
who have o lder brothers. 
•  Many mixed results!!!
Bisexual: a person who is sexually attracted to members of both sexes
Sexua lity is best regarded as a cont inuum.
