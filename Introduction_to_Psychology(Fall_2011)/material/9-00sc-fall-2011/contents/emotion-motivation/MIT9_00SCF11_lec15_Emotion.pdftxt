Emotion is Important

“If you can conceive of yourself… suddenly 
stripped of all the emotion with which our world 
now inspires you… no one portion of the 
universe would then have importance beyond 
another; and the whole character of its things 
and series of its events would be without 
significance, character, expression, or 
perspective.”

(James, 1890)

Definition of Emotion

Emotions are biologically-based 
responses to situations that are seen 
as personally relevant. They are 
shaped by learning, and usually 
involve changes in peripheral 
physiology, expressive behavior, and 
subjective experience.

EMOTION vs. MOOD
• Mood - diffuse, long-lasting 
emotional states 

• Emotion - immediate responses to a 
specific object or situation 

Dimensions of Emotion
• Arousal
high - excited, tense
low - calm, lethargic

• Valence
positive - elated, contented
negative - sad, gloomy

HOW CAN PERIPHERAL BODILY 
EVENTS INFLUENCE EMOTIONS?
• hold pencil tightly between teeth 
(forces smiling expression) or between 
lips (prevents smiling) while watching 
funny movie - smiling expression led to 
more enjoyment
• pose facial muscles (into smile or 
frown) - see pictures - then report 
feelings - frown expression reported 
more anger and less happiness

Experience, and Autonomic Reactivity: A Test of The Facial Feedback Hypothesis." Emotion 2, no. 1 (2002): 52-74.

Facial Feedback Hypothesis

Saussignan’s (2002) experiment testing the facial feedback theory of emotion 
asked some subjects to hold a pencil between their teeth in such a way that 
their lips being pulled back like they would in a full‐faced smile, and others 
were asked to hold a pencil between their lips in a way which prevented 
smiling.

Alteration of facial expression can lead to changes in the subjective experience 
of emotions.  The person on the left (pen in mouth) is more likely to report 
feeling happy than the person on the right (pencil on lip).

Video stills from a study by Ekman and his colleagues (1983). They induced a man to make a 
fearful expression by instructions: (a) “Raise your brows and pull them together,” (b) “now 
raise your upper eyelids,” and (c) “now stretch your lips horizontally, back toward your ears.”

HOW CAN PERIPHERAL BODILY 
EVENTS INFLUENCE EMOTIONS?
• perception/thought influences TYPE 
of emotion
• sensory feedback influences 
INTENSITY of emotion

HOW CAN PERIPHERAL BODILY 
EVENTS INFLUENCE EMOTIONS?
• Schacter, 1971 injected people with 
adrenaline (raises heart rate, arousal) or 
placebo
• little effect of adrenaline (jumpy)
• emotion eliciting situation - more fear 
for a horror movie, more anger when 
insulted, more laughter for comedy with 
adrenaline (but not if informed about 
the adrenaline) 

Creaky Bridge Experiment
• Dutton & Aron
• Capilano Canyon, North Vancouver
- flimsy suspension bridge, 5 ft wide, 
sways & wobbles 320 ft over jagged 
boulders and river rapids
- upstream, steady, low, broad bridge 

Creaky Bridge Experiment

• Dutton & Aron - male subjects
• in the middle of each bridge is an 
attractive female (confederate) asks each 
male subject to fill out a questionnaire, 
casually mentions that if subjects has 
more questions, he can call her at home 
and provides phone number
• dangerous bridge more calls
• safe bridge fewer calls

Creaky Bridge Experiment

• Dutton & Aron - male subjects
• dangerous bridge produces high arousal 
(increased adrenaline) interpreted as 
attraction (physiology interpreted as 
emotion of attraction)

Three Burning Questions
• Are emotions universal (inborn)?

• Do emotions have unique 
physiological signatures?

• Why do we have emotions?

Early Displays of Emotion
Infants display emotions that are distinguishable and similar to facial 
displays among adults such as joy, disgust, surprise, sadness, anger, 
and fear.

Do Emotions Have Unique 
Physiological Signatures?
• Intuition holds that emotions differ from 
one another in their bodily 
manifestations (e.g., pride, disgust, 
anger, sadness, fear).
• Language supports this common sense 
idea (e.g., “She got hot and bothered,”
“You make my blood boil,” He’s just 
letting off steam”).

Low:

facial action task (Ekman et al., 1983) - this

Why Do We Have Emotions?

• Intrapersonal functions
– Feeling: Affect as information 
– Behaving:  Doing the right thing at the 
right time
• Interpersonal functions

An infant on the visual cliff: The infant is 
placed on the center board laid across 
a heavy sheet of glass and his mother 
calls to him. If she is on the “deep” side, 
he pats the glass but despite this tactual 
information that all is safe, he refuses to 
crawl across the apparent cliff.

Why Do We Have Emotions?

• Intrapersonal functions
– Feeling: Affect as information 
– Behaving:  Doing the right thing at the 
right time
• Interpersonal functions
• Do expressions have functional 
purposes? (Adam Anderson)

Expressing Fear Enhances Sensory Acquisition

(a,b) Green arrows depict vector flow fields of skin surface deformations stemming from the antiprototype to 
the corresponding expression prototype, allowing visualization of the underlying facial‐action patterns. 
Vector flow from antifear to fear (a) and antidisgust to disgust (b) indicated the opposing expansion versus 
compression along the longitudinal axis emanating from the bridge of the nose. This resulted in raised versus 
lowered brows, increased versus decreased eye aperture and vertical elongation versus compression of the 
nose associated with raised versus lowered lips.

Sex Differences in Amygdala Activation 
and Memory for Emotional Material
• superior memory for most intense pictures in women
• both men and women had greater left amygdala activation 
for pictures rated more intense
• in women, greater left amygadala activation predicted 
stronger long-term emotional memories
• in men, greater right amygadala activation predicted 
stronger long-term emotional memories
• interpretation - both men and women activate brain in 
response to emotional pictures, but there is, on average, a 
greater overlap in brain regions involved in analyzing felt 
emotions and in making memories in women - better memories 
(and greater risk for depression?)
