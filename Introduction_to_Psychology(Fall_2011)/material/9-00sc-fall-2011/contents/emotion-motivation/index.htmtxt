***** Discussion: Emotion &amp; Motivation *****
How would you define emotion? It's difficult to do without just naming emotions
that come to mind: happiness, sadness, anger, etc. Despite how simple and
familiar these examples seem to be, our definition of emotion is fairly
complexâ¦ Read_more_Â»

**** Long Answer Question ****
Describe the three theories of emotion. Give a specific example of the
processes that would lead to an emotion under each theory.
âº Sample answer
The James-Lange theory of emotion states that the experience of an emotional
state is the result of the physical arousal caused by a stimulus or experience.
According to the James-Lange theory an event such as someone crossing a street
and hearing a loud car horn from behind. That person's heart rate, respiratory
rate, and amount of sweating will increase. This heightened physiological
arousal will cause the brain to interpret this as a situation that should cause
fear and therefore the person feels afraid due to the arousal and not directly
from the car horn.
The Cannon-Bard theory of emotion states that the experience of an emotion
occurs simultaneously with physiological arousal. If a large dog growled at a
person the person's heart rate would increase at the same time as the person
became afraid. This is different from the James-Lange theory because the
increased heart rate would not cause the emotional experience.
The Shachter-Singer two factor theory of emotion states the experience of
emotion arises from the cognitive appraisal or interpretation of the
physiological arousal and its source. An example would be if a person heard a
dog bark loudly and turned to see a large aggressive dog approaching. The
person's heart rate would increase and the person would appraise the situation
as dangerous and experience fear. However, if the person turned around and saw
a small dog the person may still be experiencing an increased heart rate, but
would appraise the situation as not being dangerous and therefore not
experience fear.
