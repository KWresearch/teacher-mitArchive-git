• baby faces are appealing – round head, 
forehead protruding forward rather than 
sloping back, large eyes, small jawbone

Neotony 
• “baby-faced” adults perceived as more naïve, 
honest, helpless, kind, warm, and also more 
likely to be found innocent in cases of 
intentional wrongdoing (no difference for 
negligence), less likely to receive votes

Nature/Nurture 
•	 Nature/Nativism/Rationalism 
•	 some knowledge is innate (Plato, 
Descartes, Kant) 
•	 Nurture/Empiricism 
•	 “Nothing is in the intellect which was 
not first in the senses.” (Aristotle, & 
Locke, Berkeley) 

Nature/Nurture 
•	 babies appear to be”blank slates” 
•	 “Give me a dozen healthy infants, well 
formed and my own specified world to 
bring them up in and I’ll guarantee to 
take any one at random and train him to 
become any type of specialist I might 
select - doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-
chief and yes, even beggerman and 
thief…” 
•	 Watson, 1878-1958, Behaviorism 

Imitation in neonates.  In a remarkable study, investigators sat face‐to‐face with 
infants just a few days old.  When the investigators stuck out their tongues, the 
infants did the same.  When the investigators opened their mouths wide, or 
pursed their lips, the infants did too.  The capacity for imitation, it seems, is in 
place even for very young babies!

infant exposed to stimulus until 
•	
looking time drops 50% or some 
preset criterion - change stimulus,

Infant Explorers 
(18-24 months) 

• infants look selectively at novel objects 
* investigate what is to be learned 
- even at 1 day for two checkerboards 
with different sizes squares from trial to trial (secs) 

Infant Explorers 
(18-24 months) 
• infants seek to control their environment 
* 20-month olds prefer mobile that 
responds 
to their bodily moments than motor-driven 
* 2-month olds – learned to start/stop video 
of Sesame Street by pulling string tied to 
wrist – showed facial expression of anger 
when device was disconnected – 4-and 5­
month olds remained angry/sad even when 
video came on as often but without their 
control (they like the control over the video) 

Infant Explorers 
(18-24 months) 
• infants explore increasingly with hands and eyes together

* first 3-4 months, explore with mouths 
* by 5-6 months, explore with hands and eyes

across cultures

• infants use social cues to guide exploration 
* 6-month olds roll or pound ball depending

on what mother did

* follow eyes of person (joint attention), but

not if eyes are closed, covered (not head direction)

* helps to learn language – infants who follow gaze better 
learn language faster 
* 12-month olds will cross visual cliff if mother smiles, 
not if mother has fearful expression, avoid new toy if 
mother exhibits disgust, otherwise played with it 

Jean Piaget 

At the beginning there was chaos…. 

Jean Piaget (1986-1980) offered 
a theory that tried to reconcile Nativism & 
Empiricism 
a frame-work for 
understanding & charting child development 

Jean Piaget 
• child prodigy 
• trained in biology (mollusks) 
• early concern whether categories 
were “out there” or in the mind 
• brief flirtation with poetry 
• worked with Binet on intelligence 
testing 
• became more interested in patterns 
of errors than successes 

Jean Piaget 

•  Assimilation 
incorporate new knowledge into 
existing cognitive structure 

•  Adaptation 
change cognitive structures to 
accommodate new evidence 

Piagetian Stages 
Stage  Age  Mental Life 
perception & physical actions 
0-2 
Sensorimotor 

Pre-Operational 2-7 

egocentric perspective; early symbolic 
language; poor differentiation of 
fantasy and reality 
7-11 
organized logical thought, concrete but 
not abstract problem solving 
Formal Operational  11-adult 
less concrete thinking, generate and 
test multiple hypotheses, consider 
physically impossible hypotheticals 
adult no new cognitive skills, knowledge 
gains 

Concrete 

Adult 

Piaget Stages 
Sensorimotor (birth - 2 years) 
• fleeting, disconnected sensory impressions & motor 
reactions - intelligence centered on action; 
thought = action 
• no distinction between stable objects & transient events, 
no distinction between “me” and “not me” 
• stage ends with beginning of abstract representations, 
symbolic thought

Sensorimotor 
Object Permanence 
• 18-24 months, beginning of abstract, representational 
thought - respond to mental representation of object, not 
the percept of the object 

Sensorimotor 
Object Permanence 
• see rattle - rattle there - look away or occlude, 
rattle no longer exists - “out of sight, out of 
existence” - not aware that an object exists 
independent of our sensorimotor interaction with 
that object 
• until 8 months, infant does not search for hidden 
toy - starts to around 8 months 
• hide toy under blanket (location A), child 
searches there - do that several times - slowly, in 
view of child, place toy under other blanket 
(location B) - child still searches under location A 
- “A-not-B effect” - not searching for “toy”, but 
rather for the “toy-that-I-find-on-the-right” 
• appearance vs. principles (ideas)

OBJECT PERMANENCE


Object permanence (A)  A 
six‐month‐old looks 
intently at a toy.  (B) But 
when the toy is hidden 
from view, the infant does 
not search for it. 
According to Piaget, this is 
because the infant does 
not as yet have the 
concept of object 
permanence.

CONSERVATION OF LIQUID QUANTITY 


Conservation of liquid quantity. (A)  A child is asked 
by the experimenter, “Do we both have the same 
amount of juice to drink?” the child says yes. (B) 
The experimenter pours the juice from one of the 
beakers into a new, wider beaker.  When now 
asked, “Which glass has more juice?”  the child 
points to the thinner one.

CONSERVATION OF MASS & NUMBER 


Conservation of mass:  Preschoolers also fail to 
conserve mass.  This child is shown two clay balls 
which he adjusts until he is satisfied that there is the 
same amount of clay in both.  The experimenter 
takes one of the balls and rolls it into a “hot dog.” 
When now asked which has more clay, the child 
points to the hot dog. 

Conservation of number:  When the two rows of coins 
are evenly spaced, the child correctly says that both 
rows contain the same number of coins.  When one 
row is spaced more widely, the child says that it has 
more coins.

•difficulty taking another person’s perspective

Concrete & Formal 
Operational 
Concrete operations (7-11) 
logical operations with concrete entities (water) 
no so much abstract 
8-9 year olds - 4 is even, 4+1 is odd, but not 
broader abstraction that even + 1 = odd 

Formal operations (12 on ...) 
logical operations with abstract entities 
hypothetical, deductive reasoning, propositional thinking 

Criticism of Piaget 

Stage-like versus continuous development 

Age 
Children achieve many of the stages set by Piaget 
earlier (including object permanence) 

A dissociation between what the 
infant knows and what the infant 
does.  (A) A seven‐month‐old looks at 
a toy that has just been placed in B, 
one of the two wells.  (B) He 
continues to look at well B after both 
wells are covered. (C) When finally 
allowed to reach for the toy, he 
uncovers well A, in which he found 
the toy on a previous trial, rather 
than well B, in which he saw the toy 
being placed.  In this particular 
sequence, he actually still looks at B 
while uncovering A, suggesting a 
dissociation between what the infant 
knows and what he does.

Some rudiments of number in six‐month‐olds.  Six‐month‐olds were shown two panels that 
contained either two or three simple objects.  Concurrently, a drum was sounded over a 
loudspeaker, producing rhythmic booms either in twos (“boom, boom”) or in threes (“boom, 
boom, boom”).  (A) When the drum was sounded “boom, boom,” the baby looked at the panel 
that contained two items.  (B) When the drum sounded “boom, boom, boom,” the baby looked 
at the panel that contained three items.  This result suggests that the baby has some 
rudimentary concept of twoness and threeness, a concept that holds whether the items 
“counted” are visual objects or sounds

Counting abilities seem to be determined in part by culture.
Members of the Pirahã tribe were asked to perform a counting 
task. While they showed high levels of accuracy with one or two 
items, their success rates fell drastically after three items, and 
could not count more than nine items.
